 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Saturday that the government is considering clarifying the situation more soon on allowing foreign capital investment in the domestic pharmaceutical (pharma) sector
 federation of indian chambers of commers and industry (fikki) kii salaana aam baithak main pradhanmantri ne kaha, 'ham aushadhi kshetra main pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadiai) niti par adhik spashtataa laane ja rahe hai
 'it is noteworthy that the Prime Minister's statement came after the decision of the Cabinet, which said that all FDI in the already functioning pharmaceutical companies will have to get approval from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) and this situation will continue till then, Until the Competition Commission of India (CCI) gets the right to decide on foreign investment in this sector
 iskaa matlab yah he ki 49 fisadi se kam alpamat videshi nivesh ko bhi exipibi se anumati lenaa hoga
 The concern of pharmaceutical companies wishing to expand is that if the FIPB does not take a decision immediately, the process could be delayed significantly

 log in to garbhavastha ke dauraan mahilaon ko kai khaas saavdhaaniyaan baratani padati hai
 There are many questions in front of them as to whether they should work or not
 aisa hi ek ahm sawaal he ki kya garbhavastha ke dauraan dieting karnaa uchit he athwa nahin? is masale par alag-alag tarah kii baaten saamne aati rahati hai
 Doctors generally advise women to avoid dieting during pregnancy, but a review published in the British Medical Journal claimed that dieting during pregnancy is safe and that there is no risk to the baby
 
 landan ke queen mairi vishvavidhyalay ke shodharthiyon ne pichley un 44adhyayanon ke nishkarshka adhyayan kiya, jisamen 7 hajaar se bhi zyada auraton ko shaamil kiya gaya tha
 After this study of old findings, these researchers came to their conclusion
 in shodharthiyon ne diet, vyaayaam yaa donon ke ek mishran kii aapas main tulana kii
 Dietary recommendations were to limit the amount of calories consumed, to have a balanced diet
 isamen sabut anaaj, fal, subjiyan or daalen khaane kii salaah di gai thi
 Researchers then examined how much the weight of women increased during pregnancy and whether it caused some complications
 Weight gain can be reduced in each of the ways mentioned above, but diet has the most effect in it
 yah ausatan 4 kilogram vajan kam karti he jabaki vyaayaam se yah maatr 0
 It weighs only 7 kilograms
 ek report ke mutabik, diet or vyaayaam kaa sahi mishran kiya jaae to ausatan 1 kilogram tak vajan ghataya ja saktaa he
 Women with controlled calories are less likely to develop these complications, but researchers say more studies are needed

 supreme court ne mangalvaar ko notebandi se judi yachika par sunwaayee karte hue centre sarkaar se poocha ki kya puraane 500 or 1000 ke noton ko bainkon jamaa karaane ke liye ek mauka or diya ja saktaa he? ucchtam nyaayal ne centre sarkaar or RBI ko notice jari kiya
 The next hearing of the case will be on April 11
 maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne centre sarkaar par sawaal uthaae
 It was said that earlier the PM assured that the period of depositing old notes will go ahead from December 30
 8 november ko jari notification main bhi kaha gaya ki jo log 30 disambar tak jamaa nahin kara paaenge unhen uchit kaaran bataakar ek taarikh tak note jamaa kar paaenge
 But on 30 December, the government brought an ordinance allowing only those present abroad to deposit notes by 31 March
 tippaniyan It was the belief of common people that they would get one more chance but the government took this opportunity without giving notice
 sarkaar bataae ki ek mahila jo 4 november se janvari tak aspataal main he or judwan bacchon ko janm detii he to videsh jane se ye kaise alag he
 The central government cannot take arbitrary steps in this matter
 sarkaar ko logon ko ek mauka or dena chahie or wo kaarnon kii satyata kaa pataa lagaakar hi jamaa karne kii ijaajat de sakati he
 AG Mukul Rohatgi from the Center opposed this
 ab ye kanoon ban chukaa he
 Even if the Prime Minister wishes, he cannot extend the date
 ab kisi bhi tarah logon ko mauka nahin diya ja saktaa
 The government took these steps thoughtfully as people were taking advantage of it
 pradhanmantri ne kabhi bhi ye nahin kaha ki aam log 31 march tak paisa jamaa kara sakate hai
 This law has been made by the Parliament and the government has only to decide that it should be followed
 darasal yachikakarta ne court ko kaha kii hamen puraane note jamaa karne kii ijaajat di jaae kyonki jamaa karne kaa samay 31 march tak he
 The central government said that according to the new ordinance, if any old notes are kept more than the prescribed limit, then it falls under the category of crime
 supreme court main daakhil yachikaaon main kaha gaya he ki pehle pradhanmantri or RBI ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki jo log kisi sahi vajah se puraane note jamaa nahin kar paae wo 31 march tak RBI main jamaa kara sakate hai
 But later this limit was extended till 30 December 2016 whereas till March 31, 2017, this exemption has been given to NRI only
 yachikaaon main kaha gaya ha chunki logon ke liye sarkaar ne ye ghoshnaa kii gai thi isliye supreme court sarkaar ko aadesh de ki wo sabhi ke liye puraane note jamaa karne kii seemaa 31 march tak kare
 The notification issued on 8 November also said that those who would not be able to submit till December 30, would be able to submit the note till one date, giving proper reasons
 lekin 30 disambar ko sarkaar adhyadesh lekar ai jisamen sirf videsh main maujuud logon ke liye 31 march tak note jamaa karaane kii chhot di gai
 The comments aam logon ke man main ye vishwaas tha ki unhen ek mauka or milegaa lekin sarkaar ne bina notice die ye mauka chin liya
 The government should tell how a woman who is in the hospital from November 4 to January gives birth to twins and is different from going abroad
 centre sarkaar is maamle main manamaana kadam nahin uthaa sakati
 The government should give the people one more chance and they can allow the submission only by finding out the truth of the reasons
 vahiin centre kii ore se AG mukul rohtagi ne iskaa virodh kiya
 Now this law has been made
 pradhanmantri chahen bhi to ye taarikh nahin badha sakate
 Now people cannot be given a chance in any way
 sarkaar ne ye kadam soch samajhakar uthaaya kyonki log iskaa bejaan phayda uthaa rahe the
 The Prime Minister never said that common people can deposit money by 31 March
 ye kanoon sansad ne banaaya he or sarkaar ko sirf ye tay karnaa he ki iskaa paalan ho
 In fact, the petitioner told the court that we should be allowed to deposit the old notes because the time to deposit is till 31 March
 centre sarkaar ne kaha nae adhyadesh ke mutabik agar koi tay seemaa se zyada puraane note abhi bhi rakhaa he to aparaadh ke category main aata he
 In the petitions filed in the Supreme Court, it has been said that earlier the Prime Minister and the RBI had announced that those who could not deposit the old notes for any right reason, can submit it to the RBI by 31 March
 lekin baad main ye seemaa 30 disambar 2016 tak hi kar di gai jabaki 31 march 2017 tak ye chhot NRI ko hi di gai he
 The petitions stated that since this announcement was made by the government for the people, the Supreme Court should order the government to limit the deposit of old notes by 31 March for all
 aam logon ke man main ye vishwaas tha ki unhen ek mauka or milegaa lekin sarkaar ne bina notice die ye mauka chin liya

 But the BJP secretary refused to give the chartered plane, saying that the party has now prohibited giving any private plane to any leader

 150 minute kii film ke teen-chauthai hisse main jab ve akele gundon se loha lete hai to jor se sitiyaan bajane ke saath ‘‘aai lav you salmaan’’ kaa shor saaf sunai detaa he
 So what happened this time? The difference is not in Jai Ho, but in Salman himself
 48 saal ke is actor ne isse pehle kabhi saamaajik-rajnatik bayaan nahin diya
 He did not promote any other film like Jai Ho, giving time to media again and again, going to Gujarat for the kite festival and engaging in the streets of politics by talking with bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi
 narendra modi ke saath unke dikhne se kuch logon ne film ke bahishkaar kaa aahvaan kar daalaa
 According to Box Office India editor Wazir Singh, the film has also been a very personal journey for Salman
 isaki shuruyaat dedh saal pehle tab ho gai thi jab salmaan ne pe it forward par aadhaarit telugu film stallin dekhi thi
 He admitted that he disagreed with Walt Disney's famous statement: "I hope to teach people that they will be entertained, instead i will entertain them and hope that they learn something
" ’’ salmaan ne bataaya, ‘‘stallin dekhne ke baad mujhe laga ki usamen santulit najariya apanaaya gaya he

 From filling the hospital bills of the poor to giving opportunities to new faces in Bollywood, everyone has habits
 saleem khan kehete hai, ‘‘use laga ki shaayad har kisi ko dusron kii madad karne ke sukh kaa ehsaas nahin he or vah yah ehsaas dusron ko dilaanaa chahta tha
 Salim was badly hurt after the 2001 car accident that brought Salman into disrepute
 unhone kaha, ‘‘koi aam aadmi hota to 950 ru
 i would have missed paying a fine of Rs
 celibrity bhi kanoon se upar nahin hai, lekin hamen misaal bana diya gaya
 Salman himself has said a similar thing
 jai ho dekhte samay is tarah kii kai baaten hamaare jehan main aati hai
 Actually, for the first time, the audience has seen the serious face of "bhai", who till now was used to seeing Dabangg and funny hero in films like Ready and Dabangg
 saleem maanate hai ki yah kahana abhi bahut jaldbaaji hogi ki logon tak film kaa sandesh nahin pahunchaa he
 Salman wanted to see the changes that happened to be family
 box offis kii kamai to is sabake saath hi judaa hua bonus bhar he
 They do not explain why they chose this time to reveal their real face and to express their outrage from the always deceitful, deceitful society
 lekin itnaa tay he ki bade dil or mote dolon vaale jis acshan hero ne pehle hi kah diya tha ki ‘‘kisi bhi nuksaan kii jimmedaari’’ sirf uski hogi, vah is jatke ko bhi hansate-hansate jhel jayega

 The Congress also wants to bring some big names along

 The acceptance of Bhole Ji Maharaj in Garhwal is more than that of Satpal Maharaj

 The time will tell if the BJP gets benefit by prolonging the investigation, but it has got the spice of creating uproar with the BJP
 10 baagi vidhayakon ke congress se alag hone ke baad party main ravat ko chunauti dene vaala koi damdaar netaa nahin he par unke paas najuk bahumat he
 BJP and other anti-rawat leaders are trying to seduce the six-member group (PDF) of pro-government independents UKD and BSP mlas under the pretext of this investigation
 isi ranneeti ke tahat peedief ne congress se apane kisi sadsy ko rajyasabha bhejne kii maang kii he
 While the state Congress first recommended the name of Upadhyaya for the Rajya Sabha, but after a few days, the decision was withdrawn and left to the Congress high command
 sibiai jaanch kis karavat baithegi, isaki chintaa peedief ko bhi he
 Being an associate of the government, the investigation can also be turned towards it
 aise main uske paas sirf siyaasi paala badalane kaa vikalp hi bachegaa
 The same strategy is playing PDF cards
 duusari ore congress anusuchit jati vibhaag kii baithak main kisi anusuchit jati ke vyakti ko rajyasabha bheje jane kii maang uthi he
 From the PDF quota, Minister Dinesh Dhanai says, "PDF has very deliberately demanded the Rajya Sabha seat
 ham sarkaar ke saath chaar saal se hai
 If Congress does not respect our demand then we will be free to take any decision
 '' is bahaane peedief apane liye vikalp khule rakhana chahta he ki taaki jarurat padane par vah jaanch kii pechidagi se bachane ke liye congress se apana peechha chhudaa sake
 The PDF is currently appearing with Rawat but it is easy to intimidate the PDF by continuing the CBI inquiry despite the state cabinet rejecting the CBI probe
 bijepi ke netaa gaahe-bagaahe chetavanee dete dikhte hai ki sibiai peedief ko bhi der-saver jaanch ke ghere main laa sakati he
 On the basis of the PDF itself, the Congress had recently proved its majority in the 62-member Assembly with its 26 elected and one nominated MLA, besides six PDF members, in the 62-member Assembly
 bijepi ne ravat par hamale tej kar die hai
 According to BJP state president Ajay Bhatt, "if Harish Rawat was innocent, he would have done dr in his absence
" indira hridayesh kii adhyakshata main mantrimandal kii baithak karakar sibiai jaanch kii adhisuchana radd kyon karai? jaanch main unhen apane funsane kaa dar tha, isiilie ve aisa kadam uthaa rahe hai
 The BJP is also exploring possibilities in the PDF Rajya Sabha claim
 bijepi netaa sanket bhi de rahe hai ki peedief ko rajyasabha ke liye samarthan chahie to use bijepi se baat kerani chahie
 The BJP believes that this may prove to be a good opportunity to break the pdf-congress support

 iske baavjood purvanchal kii andekhi karne kaa aarope samaajawaadee party par lagata rahaa he

 isi din rahul gandhi bhi purvanchal kii baharich seat par aakar raily karenge
 Narendra Modi has also held a rally here earlier
 purvanchal kii chintaa kii vajah se hi akhilesh yadav ke virodh ke baavjood mulaayam singh yadav or shivpal ne milakar mukhtaar ansaari kii kaumi ekta dal se haath milaayaa

 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke liye congress or patidaar anamat andolan ke netaa hardik patel ke bich philhal sahmati to ban gai he, lekin is andolan kii sabase pramukh maang patidaar aarakshan ko lekar abhi congress ne apana rukh saaf nahin kiya he or yahi masalaa congress or hardik donon ke liye mushkil kaa sabab ban saktaa he
 Due to all the constitutional and other compulsions, it is not so easy to give reservation to the Patels in the state and everyone is eyeing what attitude the Congress takes on this main issue and what steps Hardik Patel takes after the Congress's stand? Hardik Patel has now relented after giving an ultimatum to the Congress' stand on the issue of no opposition or opposition
 hardik patel ne kaha he ki 3 november ko surat main hone vaali congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii jansabha kaa vah na hi samarthan karenge, na hi virodh
 Hardik Patel said that the legal opinion that the Congress has asked to wait on this issue is also ready to wait for it
 unhone kaha ki patidaar 7 november tak aarakshan par congress ke plan kaa intjaar karenge
 Hardik also said that if Rahul Gandhi himself wants to talk in this matter, then we will go and talk
 5 main se 4 muddon par bani he batadrasal, hardik patel ne chetavanee di thi ki agar congress ne patidaar samaaj ke aarakshan par apana rukh spasht nahin kiya to uskaa virodh kiya jayega
 After which Congress leaders held a meeting with the Patidars on Monday
 meeting ke baad hardik ne bataaya ki patel samaaj ke paanch main se 4 muddon par congress se sahmati ban gai he
 The first issue in this is that after the violence in the reservation movement, cases filed against the people of the Patidar society will be returned
 congress ne vaada kiya he ki aarakshan andolan ke dauraan darj 590 main 290 se waapas liye jaaenge
 Also, treason cases will also return
 isi prakaar congress ne vaada kiya he ki sarkaar banane par patidaar hinsa peedit pariwaron ko 35 lakh rupee kii aarthik madad di jaaegi
 Also, a family member will be given a government job
 patidaar aarakshan andolan ke dauraan golibari or lathicharge karne waalon ke khilaaf karrwai kaa aashwaasan bhi congress ne diya he
 Congress has said that an inquiry committee will be formed in this regard and strict action will be taken against the culprits
 congress ne sarkaar banane par 600 karod rupee ke ayog ko 2 hajaar karod tak le jane kaa vaada kiya he
 This commission will be implemented on constitutional basis, which will be given central status
 aasaan nahin patelon ko aarakshanpatelon kii mukhya maang aarakshan ko lekar congress ne somvaar kii meeting main koi vaada nahin kiya he
 Describing the issue of reservation as technical, the Congress has asked for a legal opinion on it
 congress ne vakeelon or jajon se is sambandh main charchaa kar jald kii party kaa rukh spasht karne kaa aashwaasan patidaaron ko diya he
 This is the issue on which it is the most difficult task for Hardik and Congress to find a way out
 gauratlab he ki samvidhan ke mutabik 50 fisadi se zyada aarakshan nahin diya ja saktaa
 If a caste is to be included in the OBC category, then an application should be made on behalf of that caste to the OBC Commission
 anushansa ke baad hi kisi jati ko us shrenee main jagah mil sakati he
 Therefore, reservation to Patidars can be given only within the quota given to obcs
 lekin isko lekar duusare samudaayon main virodh sharu ho jayega
 Recently OBC leader Alpesh Thakor has joined Congress
 alpesh thakor vahi netaa hai, jo patelon ko aarakshan dene kaa virodh karte rahe hai
 State Congress chief Bharat Singh Solanki says that they will give 20 percent to the economically backward people from the reserved quota as reservation
 iske kaaran obisi, essi, asti ko die jane vaale 49 pratishat kaa kota bhi nahin badalegaa or duusari ore aarthik taur par pichde logon ko aarakshan kaa laabh bhi milegaa
 They say that they will not give reservation to Patels through OBC quota
 lekin yah bhi aasaan nahin he
 Earlier, the BJP government had announced 10 per cent reservation for ebcs under pressure from the Patidars, but the Gujarat High Court stayed it last August
 yah maamla supreme court main lambit he
 Only by amending the constitution can reservations be given to upper caste people on an economic basis
 samvidhan visheshgy kehete hai ki patelon ko obisi kota kaa phayda dena kisi bhi party ke liye bahut mushkil he
 There is no provision of reservation on economic grounds
 patidaaron ko aarakshan dene kaa keval ek hi rasta he ki unhen rajya sarkaar obisi kii suchi main daal de
 At the time of the Patidars' agitation, the Gujarat government had also said, "as per the constitution and the decisions of the Supreme Court, we cannot make any change in the structure of reservation for SC, ST and OBC, nor should we give more than 50 per cent reservation
 Can
 vibhinn samyavadhi par vibhinn rajya sarkaron ne samvidhan or ucchtam nyaayalay ke faislon ke khilaaf aarakshan diya he
 We do not want to do that
 rajya sarkaar jhuthe vaade karne main vishwaas nahin karti he
 However, the state cabinet has approved the creation of a commission to demand reservation for the Patidar community
 congress kii duvidhapatidaar samaaj ko obisi cote main samyojit karne ke prayaas se obisi cote kaa bada vot bank congress se chhitak saktaa he
 The OBC quota in Gujarat is about 54 percent of the electorate
 aise main sawaal ye he ki rahul gandhi hardik patel ke samarthan ke liye itane bada vot bank chhitakane kaa risk lenge? rahul gandhi patidaar samaaj ke liye alag se kota dene kaa vaada bhi nahin kar sakate, kyonki yah sanvaidhanik rup se sambhav nahin he
 Hardik's difficulty: If Rahul Gandhi did not promise to provide reservation to the Patidar community, it could be the biggest problem for Hardik Patel
 hardik patel ke bhaajapa ko samarthan dene ke dur-dur tak asaar nahin hai
 Now if Hardik distances himself from the election, his existence as a Patidar leader will also be questioned
 hardik ke agenda main phir chunaav ke baad jo bhi sarkaar aegi, us par patidaar samaaj ke liye aarakshan kaa dabaav banavaane kii hi hogi
 Why the demand for reservation? The Patidar community is a Dominant in Gujarat and has stood in the industry, agriculture and even in many education sectors, they are prosperous
 ye wo log hai, jinhone nakadi fasalon se paisa kamaaya or use laghu, majhole udyogon main daalaa, lekin aarope yah he ki modi ke shasankaal main keval bade udyogon kii ore dhyaan diya or ye sabhi chote udyog band hote chale gaye
 According to the critics of the government, about 60,000 industries were shut down and its impact was more on the Patel community
 isi tarah south gujarat main diamond industry main giravat ai or uskaa bhi prabhaav in par hua, yahi vajah he ki ye log jo aarakshan maang rahe hai
 Reservation supporters say that there is such a large section of the Patels who are working as laborers, they do not have education, no jobs, so their demand is justified
 sanyukt raashtra main kashmir kaa mudda uthaane ke liye navaj sharif kii aalochana karte hue congress ne kaha ki unke bhaashan main paak sena ke kattarpathiyon kii chhap he, kyonki islamabad main unki sarkaar 'gheraabandi' main he
 The Congress said that it is inappropriate for the Prime Minister of Pakistan to raise bilateral issues in international fora and also stressed that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and there can be no compromise on the issue
 congress pravaktaa anand sharma ne kaha ki navaj sharif dwaara sanyukt raashtra main kashmir kaa mudda uthaanaa nindaneey he
 It is unsuitable for a prime minister to use the international platform to raise issues that are really only related to Pakistan and India
 purv vaanijya mantri anand sharma ne kaha ki jammu-kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang he or yah koi aisa mudda nahin, jis par koi samjhauta ho
 He said that India is the largest democracy in the world, the people of Jammu and Kashmir express their opinions freely by exercising their right to vote
 bhartiya janata party ke purv rashtriya adhyaksh rajnath singh ne uttar pradesh kii mukhyamantri mayawati par daliton ke saath chal karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki daliton kaa sarvaadhik shoshan daliton ke naam par raajnneeti karne vaali basapa sarkaar ke raaj main hi hua he
 Singh, who was the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, while addressing the 'dalit Adhikar Mahamelan' organized by the party, said that the BJP, committed to social harmony, made Mayawati three times chief minister and not only betrayed the BJP but did politics in the name of Dalits And have tricked them as well
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki bhaajapa ab bhavishya main bahujan samaaj party ke saath kisi bhi tarah kaa talmail athwa samjhauta nahin karne vaali he or unki party kaa sankalp he ki basapa ko satta se baahar kiya jaye
 Describing social harmony as essential for the progress of the country and society, Singh said that the people of the Dalit society have played an important role in the freedom struggle and that the glorious history of the Dalit society will be included prominently in the text books on the formation of the BJP government
 
 yah bataate hue ki unki sarkaar ne sarkari naukariyon main anusuchit jati ke baikalaag ko bharne ke liye muhim shur kii thi, singh ne aarope lagaaya ki mayawati sarkaar ne na sirf daliton ke saath chal kiya he balki sarvaadhik utpeedan bhi dalit samaaj ke logon kaa hi hua he
 Senior party leader and former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Uma Bharti alleged from the mention of incidents that law and order is no longer a thing under the BSP Raj and most of the oppression has been caused by backward and Dalit people
 dalit mahasammelan main aaye logon se uma bharti ne apil kii ki satta badalane kii jimmedaari aap kii he or vyavastha badalane kii jimmedaari hamaari hogi
 He attacked the Kuraj of the BSP government and said, 'under the Maya raj, the brokers ate Malay and Dalits did not even get dry bread
 ’yah kehete hue ki shiksha, swasthya evam rojgaar kii yojanaon ke paise se pathar kii murtiyon khadi kii gayin, bharti ne kaha ki yah unke hisse kaa hi paisa tha, jisase pathar ke hathi or murtiyon khadi kii gayi hai
 Kalraj Mishra, the party's national vice president and chairman of the state election committee, mentioned the oppression and injustice of Dalits in the BSP government and said that the concern is that after 65 years of independence, the Dalit Rights Convention is needed, whereas the state The head Mayawati herself is from the Dalit society
 sammelan ko party ke pradesh adhyaksh suryapratap shahi, dalit morche ke prabharee evam rashtriya pravaktaa ramnath kovid evam party ke dalit morche ke rashtriya adhyaksh dushyanth gautam ne bhi sambodhit kiya or daliton kii samasyaon kaa ullekh karte hue unhen hal karne ke liye party kii patibaddhta jaahir kii
 An eight-point resolution was also passed at the conference with mention of the party's policy and program for the development and betterment of Dalits

 Both the major stock market indices opened on the BSE with the Sensex and the Nifty falling sharply on the NSE
 jahaan sensex ne 300 ankon kii giravat ke saath trading shuru kii vahiin nifti bhi 100 ank ludhakar kaarobaar kar rahaa he

 Match Report - In the opening moments, Uruguay tried to dent France's defense with the quickness and counter-attacking ability of Lucas Torreira and Louis Suarez
 gol karne kaa pehla acha mauka haalanki france ke paas tha
 Kylian Embappé, the hero of France's win against Argentina, got the ball inside the box with the efforts of Benjamin Powered and Oliver Girod
 unke paas samay tha, lekin unhone jaldbaaji main header lagaaya or gend cross baar ke upar se baahar chali gai
 Varan, however, gave France an edge after that
 urugve ke paas madhyantar se thik pehle barabari kaa behtareen mauka tha, lekin golkeeper loris ne france par se sankat taala
 Martin Caceres hit an accurate header on Torreira's cross, but Loris stopped him with one hand while floating in the air before the ball could reach the goal
 urugve duusare half ke shuru se hi gol karne ke liye betaab dikhaa, lekin france kii team bhi nae badlaavon ke saath adhik urjavan dikhi
 Meanwhile Luis Suarez also had a chance to equalize Uruguay, but failed to deliver his miraculous performance at the right time

 (also from input IANS) (input ieenes se bhi) What do we do for good health? diet kaa khyaal rakhte hai, sone-jagane kaa hisaab rakhte hai, eksrasij kaa khyaal rakhte hai
 Many adopt good habits, but do you know that some bad habits also help us to stay healthy
 kai baar aisa hota he ki jin aadaton ko ham bura samajhakar chhod dete hai, darasal, wo hamaare liye acchhee hoti hai
 These are 5 such habits which we consider to be bad but leave it wrong
 1
 Full cream milk Peenakya You are also among those who go to the shop and ask for toned or double toned milk
 agar aap aisa karte hai to turant apni is aadat ko badal daaliye
 According to one study, full cream milk is comparatively more effective in reducing diabetes and obesity
 2
 Most of the people who visit on an off day feel that after working for a week, they should only rest on the off day
 lekin aisa sochna or aisa karnaa galat he
 According to a study, it is better to hang out at home than on a day off
 isse shanti milti he
 Also, creativity also increases
 aaraam karnaa jaruri he lekin ghoomane-phirane ko bekaar samajhnaa galat
 3
 gandagi se rahanaa, itnaa bura bhi nahioti to har cheez kii buree hi hoti he
 If you live very cleanly and think that by doing this you will never get sick, then tell you that your thinking is wrong
 bahut zyada safai se rahane waalon kaa immune system kamajorho jaataa he
 Due to this, you may also fall ill soon
 darasal, hamaari twachaa par kai aise bacteria maujuud hote hai jo sehat ke liye achche hote hai
 In such a situation, these bacteria die due to excessive cleanliness, while our body needs them
 4
 It is right to work on time but not with stress, if you understand the value of time, there is nothing better than this
 lekin kai log aise hote hai jo kaam ko fatafat se nipataane ke chakkar main tanaav le lete hai
 Initially, it does not seem to have any effect but later on it can also become a serious problem
 kaam ko fatafat nipataane ke chakkar main bahut se log tanaav kaa shikaar ho jate hai, khaanaa-pinaa bhul jate hai or sona kam kar dete hai
 All these things are enough to spoil your health
 5
 So how much coffee do you drink? You must have heard many people say that drinking tea and coffee is dangerous for health
 khaastaur par subah uthakar chaay pinaa yaa coffee pinaa
 But this is not completely correct
 subah uthakar chaay yaa coffee pine se energy milti he
 The caffeine present in it activates our brain
 lekin bahut adhik chaay yaa coffee lene se isaki lat lag sakati he, joki galat he

 ’ In the local politics of Bihar, taking care of the caste community in which there is a dispute over the name of sitting together, former Congress President and UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi gave a new message in her dinner
 sonia ke dinar main sonia kii mej par purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh dahini ore baithe the, to bain or the 'ham' party ke dalit musahar netaa jithan ram maanjhi
 In this political dinner of Sonia, special care was taken that whoever comes should take the sign of politics in future
 isliye bhavishya ke lihaaj se sonia kii teble par agar maanjhi the to rahul kii teble par wo the jo rahul ke netritv ko lekar bhavishya main pareshaani paidaa kar sakate hai or wo hai ensipi supremeo sharad pavaar
 Maratha Kshatrap Sharad Pawar was present on the side seat of Rahul Gandhi
 itnaa hi nahin duusari badi siyaasi player mayawati ke sipahasaalar satish chandra mishra bhi rahul kii hi mej par baithe the
 After Sharad Pawar and Mayawati, the biggest player was Mamata Banerjee
 haalanki mamata banerjee khud to nahin ain lekin unhone apane kareebi sudeep bandopadhyaay ko bheja
 Sudeep Bandopadhyay was sitting at the table of Sonia Gandhi's warlord Ahmed Patel
 vaise mamata kesiar ke saath milakar tisare morche kii kavayad main bhi juty hai, lekin sonia ke bulaave par apana numaayinda bhejkar unhone modi ke khilaaf congress kii dhuree vaale morche kii sanjidagi ko jinda rakhaa
 However, at this dinner, Sonia herself prepared the menu
 is baat kaa khaas khyaal rakhaa gaya tha ki kuch netaa kerala- bengal se aaenge, to kuch upi-bihar se, vahiin kuch kashmir se honge
 That is why, after veg-non-veg soup, cheese vegetable, chickpeas, chickpeas and lentils were kept in the veg dishes
 vahi matan or chikan ke saath bengal- kerala ke netaaon ke maddenjar zinga machhlee bhi thi
 After this, when it came to sweetness, Rabri, Jalebi, Rasgulla and ice cream were present
 aakhir main uttar bharatiyon ke liye mithe paan kaa intjaam tha
 Along with this, taking special care of Omar Abdullah from Jammu and Kashmir, there was also a provision for Kahave, which was taken by former CM of Jharkhand Hemant Soren with food
 vahiin, chennai se aane vaali kanimojhi ke liye dosa special dish thi
 Also, former CM of the state, Babulal Marandi, who came from Jharkhand, said that for us, paan was very strong
 paan kii tarif karne waalon menlalu yadav ke bete tejaswior beti misa bharti bhi shaamil rahe
 The special thing is that Sonia herself received every incoming leader of 19 parties by going to the gate
 iske baad mamata, akhilesh, mayawati ke numaayindon se unke netaaon kaa haal janaa
 Rahul himself also followed this step of Sonia, who asked her representatives about her leader's condition who did not come to the top
 saaf tha ki sonia ke saaye main rahul kaa netritv talashne kii koshish is dinar main rahi
 But first, instead of making any haste, the voice of playing the bugle to gather the name of Sonia to overthrow the Modi government was definitely seen
 khaskar, upi ke dhur siyaasi virdohi sapa ke ramgopal yadav or basapa ke satish mishra kii photo ne sabhi ko hairaan kar hi diya
 However, Sonia's dinner politics was meant to make the Congress the pivot of the Modi opposition, on which Mamata Banerjee could sabotage the Telangana CM KCR by trying to form a third front
 isiiliecongress ne rahulke bajaay sonia ko centre main rakh siyaasi kavayad ko siyaasi dinar ke taur par anjaam diya
 But the political journey is long, this is the beginning, Sonia's political train will move in this direction or will be staggered, its decision will decide the outcome of the upcoming state assembly elections
 dilli main mantri rah chuke purv congressi netaa shuukravaar ko alji se milane pahunche
 The purpose of the meeting was to complain to the Kejriwal government of Delhi and according to the Congress leaders, the complaints and allegations are so serious that LG should immediately recommend the dismissal of the Kejriwal government

 The development of Delhi has been stalled by the Kejriwal government only wants a confrontation, now that the High Court has also made clear the position of the government, the government has not taken a lesson

 purv parivahan mantri ramakant goswami ne kaha ki kejariwal sarkaar kaa dhyaan jamini samasyaon par nahin he, aise main uparajyapal ko pahal kerani chahie
 He appealed to the LG to come out on the streets of Delhi to take stock of the ground reality and bring the government back on track
 alji ko gali mohallon main nikal kar dilli main prashasan behatar karnaa chahie
 Because even the High Court has now considered him the administrator of Delhi and this is his responsibility

 Then we will talk, but it did not work that way

 DAVOS2019: PM Modi is seen on the stage of Davos even this year, if there is no electoral compulsion? In Switzerland, the ski resort city of Davos is decorated with the great nobles

 Last year, Narendra Modi, who arrived in Davos at the 48th conference of the World Economic Forum with the top 100 businessmen of the country, is not attending the 49th conference this year
 vajah bhi saaf he
 The bugle of the electoral battle is going on in the country and Prime Minister Modi, who has been criticized for his foreign visits during his five-year tenure, does not want to give any issue to the opposition which is included in the list of failures

 UP main 5 siton par simat jaaegi bhaajapa, agar akhilesh-mayawati se mil gaye rahul gandhi: MOTN2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ke netritv main bijepi ko jo prachand jeet mili or congress jis tarah 44 siton tak simat gai uske baad vipakshi dalon main saaf sandesh gaya ki bijepi ko haraana kisi ek dal ke bas kii baat nahin he
 It was from here that the term Mahagathbandhan came into existence, which was first tested in Bihar and the RJD-JDU alliance won the assembly elections and passed it
 beete 18 disambar ko gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke parinaam jaise hi aane shuru hue or aisa lagane laga ki bhaajapa rajya main haar sakati he, share bazaar main sensex or nifti ke suchakank main pandrah minute ke bheetar do fisadi kii giravat aa gai
 Later, when it became clear that the BJP would remain in power, the market stabilized again
 modi sarkaar ko bazaar anukool mana jaataa he
 The frenzy-depressive behavior that we saw in the market behavior in those fifteen minutes is expected to be repeated on a much larger scale in the next fifteen months as the Lok Sabha and eight more state assembly elections are due
 haalanki bazaar hitaishiyon ke liye yah ek nai chintaa he, kyonki jaise-jaise chunaav kareeb aate jaaenge, modi sarkaar loklubhaavan kadam uthaa sakati he
 The federal budget was a good barometer of this intention
 ek saal se zyada samay tak suchakank main teji rahane ke baad bajet ke uparaant share bazaar gir gaya, or tab se gira hua hi he
 Some blame the US event for this, while others blame the populist budget, which made extensive provisions for food items and rural infrastructure and debt burden on investors by imposing a 10 per cent tax on long-term capital gains in stocks
 Has also been increased

 Apart from buying equity mutual funds, retail investors have bought shares directly
 pratyaksh nivesh ne suchakank vistaar ko prerit kiya, kyonki vyaktigat niveshak chote cap sheyaron kii kharid bhi karte hai, jise santhaan dekhte bhi nahin hai, balki nijee niveshkon ko usamen nivesh karne dete hai
 This has promoted a high value attraction for small caps

 But if the retail investor decides to reduce their equity exposure, the market will go down regardless of the institutional attitude
 khudara vikray pehle charan main suchakank kii badhat ko kam karne ke liye aage badhegaa, uske baad kvayutual fund bada stock bechney ko majaboor ho saktaa he, agar mochan dabaav badhegaa to pramukh suchakank neeche girane lagenge
 Private investors are driven by emotions and political changes will affect their investment outlook

 The Congress has launched a scathing attack on Modi for his alleged neglect of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's death anniversary program
 congress ne kaha ki narendra modi sarkaar ne indira gandhi kii punyatithi ko jis tarah se manaaya vah 'bahut kharaab or chote dimag' kii nishaani he
 At the same time, on this charge of the Congress, the BJP wondered whether the Congress only wants to see history from the nehru-gandhi family scenario
 congress ke varisht netaa anand sharma ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'yah chhudra dimag he, yah pakshpatpurna he or un logon ke prati asammaan he jinhone desh ke liye apni jaan di, khaskar indira gandhi kaa, jinhone desh kii ekta ke liye jivan balidaan kiya
 He said, such conduct also shows what Modi and BJP are
 centre sarkaar aaj deshbhar main sardaar vallabhbhai patel kii jayanti ko 'rashtriya ekta diwas' ke rup main manaa rahi he
 Modi flagged off the unity race this morning
 aaj hi indira gandhi kaa shahadat diwas bhi he
 The previous Congress-led governments celebrated Indira Gandhi's death anniversary with extensive media publicity and events
 iske vipareet nai sarkaar ne aaj sardaar patel kii jayanti ko bade paimaane par manaaya
 Anand Sharma said that it is ironic that Modi flagged off the unity race, but he did not even mention the supreme sacrifice of one of the great leaders of our time
 fasebuk massenger duniya ke sabase bade missaiging tul main se ek he
 Its biggest feature is that there is no ad in it, which helps users a lot
 lekin ek mashhoor tech website kii khabar kii maane to wo din dur nahin jab fasebuk massenger main aid dikhne shuru honge
 The tech website has claimed that it has obtained some such leaked documents from Facebook, which have recorded information related to placing ads in Messenger since the second quarter of 2016
 haalanki website nesorce kii sikresika hawala dete hue us dastavej kii photo nahin jari nahin kii he
 The report states that Facebook has created a short URL fb
 com / msg / launch kiya he jo bijness aids ke saath ek alag chat thread open karegaa
 Through this, other companies will be able to add ads in Messenger
 website ke mutabik, jab unhone is maamle par fasebuk se puchha to unhone kaha, 'ham afvaahon par koi coment nahin karte
 We want to provide 800 million people around the world with messaging experience through Messenger
 iske liye ham yugers ko anachaahe massej nahin dena chaahate'
 This makes it clear that the company cannot bring it directly through the second door of the messenger, in which the unwanted message of the business can be limited or stopped

 kya yah smartphone is segment main behatar he? is smartfo nen aisa kya he jo dusron main nahin he? company ke daavon par kya yah smartphone asal jindagi main khara utarataa he? aise hi sawaalon ke jawaab dhundne ke liye hamane is smartphone ko kaaphi dinon tak yuj kiya he or ise kai paimaanon par jaancha parkhaa he taaki aapako ye bataa paaen ki yah smartphone aapke liye kaisaa rahegaa
 In this review, you will read about the design and build quality of the smartphone, which display like Nokia x is beneficial for you? About display performance Is this smartphone fast? Does it not hang? Leg or not? How is gaming? This smartphone has a dual camera, do you benefit from it? You will also know about things like battery, software, apart from how the dual camera is and how good or bad the photography is
 dizin or bild qualitisbase pehle aap is smartphone ko hold karte hai or disple kii taraf dekhte hai to aapako iphone x yaad aayega
 The build quality of Vivo V9 is solid and it looks premium
 lekin company iske rier panel par thodaa or kaam karti to shaayad shandaar lagata
 but it's not like that
 price ke lihaaj se iskaa back panel ne hamen thodaa niraash kiya he
 In the front of the device, you will only see the screen i
e
 the next part is full of 90 percent display
 isamen koi shaq nahin hona chahie ki iskaa dizin iphone x se inspire he jo dekhte hi aapako pataa chalata he
 The rear also has the same vertical camera setup as the iphone X, that is, the cam ra bump
 haalanki elidi donon camere ke neeche di gai he, jabaki iphone x main donon camaron ke mid main he
 Vivo V9 is slim i
e
 7
 9mm
 The micro USB port is available in the bottom, but the company should have given USB Type C
 is segment ke smartphone main USB Type c hona chahie
 The speaker grill is also in the bottom
 bain taraf sim or micro esady card trey he or wolum rocker smartphone ke dayee taraf he
 The rear has an aluminum finish, which you can also call glossy
 displaceivo V9 ko isaki disple khubasurat banaati he
 6 in this smartphone
 3 inch kii phul echdi plus IPS disple di gai he or aspect reshyo 19:9 kaa he
 Glass 2
 5 karvd he jisase disple yuj karnaa aasaan hota he
 At the top of the display, you will see the Nokia as in the iphone X, although the Nokia is smaller than the iphone X, because the sensors are less used in it
 zyaadaatar eps main noch kaa saport nahin he, isliye wo tradishnal screen par hi dikhte hai
 The color reproduction of the display is superb and it is also bright
 vuing angal main hamen kabhi kabhi kuch pareshaani hui he or isaki vajah 19:9 kaa aspect reshyo he
 Vivo launched V7 Plus, whose display looked a bit stretched, but this time the company has done a great job and is no longer a problem
 dhoop main screen ke contant dekhne main bhi koi samasya nahin he
 Performance now talks about its performance which is most special
 Vivo V9 main qolkom snapadragon 626 procesar ke saath 4GB ram diya gaya he
 It is an Octacore processor and the company could have given a slightly better processor to this smartphone
 baharhaal ham baat karte hai asal jindagi main isaki parformens kisi he
 Because many times the devices with the specifications on paper get stuck in real life
 multi tasking ke liye yah smartphone behatar or task parform karne main zyada vakt nahin lagaataa
 Easy to switch from one app to another
 ap loding time bhi kam he or pehle se khule hue ap dubaara open hone main time nahin lagaate or uske contant aasaani se dikh jate hai
 Gaming is also decent and our experience has been average for heavy gaming
 baat karte hai software kii to isamen letest Android 8
 Funtouch OS 4, the company's own mobile OS based on 1 Oreo
 0 diya gaya he
 There are many blotware i
e
 pre-installed apps which also bother a lot
 software kaa anubhav thodaa lag vaala rahaa he, lekin kah sakate hai ki letest android hone kii vajah se yah behatar hota he
 The company needs to improve more
 camera rivyuham camera rivyuu camere or photography ko samajhane vaale profeshnal se karaate hai taaki wo ise achche parakh saken
 So that you can know how much the smartphone meets the company's claim
 is baar Vivo V9 kaa camera test kiya he saket ne
 The company has done a lot of work on the camera in Vivo V9
 company apana prachaar bhi camera or mujeec phone ke naam se karti he
 In this case, we also did a lot of camera testing
 pehle aapako bataa den, iske back main 16 megapixl or 5 megapixl ke do camere hai
 It also has LED flash
 rier camere main aapako profeshnal, ultra-echdi, slo moshan, time laps, boke mod, shot rifocus, HDR, phase beauty or panoroma jaise fitures milenge
 Here we took a lot of pictures from the back camera
 khaskar boke mod kaa zyada se zyada istemaal karne kii koshish kii
 Here we found that the result is somewhat mixed
 yani kuch tasviren behad aakarshak hai to vahiin kuch tasveeron camera parfect bler karne main naakaam rahaa he
 Sometimes in looking at the portrait carefully, it appears that the nose has disappeared from the face and sometimes the ear
 lekin kai-kai tasviren itani aakarshak hoti hai, jinhen dekhakar lagata he maanon kisi f / 1
 Photographs were taken with a prime lens with 2 apertures
 color ke maamle main camera is price segment main kaaphi mjedaar he
 This camera is better at taking macro shots
 jahaan tak raat main lee gai tasveeron kii baat he to agar liting thik-thaak he to camere kii parformens thik maani ja sakati he, lekin lite jate hi camere kaa parformens prabhavit hone lagati he
 You may get upset at locking the shot and getting it processed
 saath hi kuch tasviren raat main agar aap bahut jaldi main lenaa chahenge to shorpaness miss karenge
 Also, when talking about the zoom of the camera here, the pictures come but the detailing is lost
 jahaan tak duusare fitures or video kii baat he to ye camera 4k video tak record karne sakasham he
 Along with this, AI features have also been given that you will see from face beauty to AR sticker
 isamen optical image stabiligeshan or electronic image stabiligeshan kii kami he aise main video thodi shaike hoti hui lag sakati he
 Now if we talk about front camera, then the company left no stone unturned to make it better
 iske front main 24 megapixl kaa camera maujuud he
 LED flash is not provided, but display flash is provided
 yahaan bhi aapako HDR, live photo, boke mod, phase beauty, AR steekar or group selfi jaise fitures milenge
 However, professional mode is not available here
 front camere se din kii photose bahut hi shandaar hai, vahiin raat membhi kam raushnee main selfi camera behatar kaam karata he
 But if you expect too many sharp photos, then there can definitely be disappointment
 sample photosefaisla –is segment main kai smartphone hai, lekin ye unamem se thodaa alag jarur he
 You can buy this smartphone for display quality and camera

 It shows the strength of non-violence

 "he said that Modi made the whole of India in line by taking anti-people decisions like demonetisation under the guise of fight against black money, but gave no account of how much black money came out of this step
 rahul ne kaha ki notebandi ke baad bainkon or atm ke baahar jo kataren lageen, unamem koi 'suut boot vaala chor' nahin khadaa tha
 Now the Modi government has started a cashless system which is beyond the comprehension of farmers, poor and laborers

 The Congress vice-president said that Modi has waived one lakh and 40 thousand crore rupees of industrialists and is now again trying to forgive six lakh crore rupees of his favorite families
 rahul ne congress ke rajyasabha sadsy piel puniya ke bete tathaa jaidpur se congress pratyaashee tanuj puniya ke samarthan main yojit jansabha main kaha ki bhaajapa netaa jahaan bhi jate hai, sirf nafrat failaakar logon ko aapas main ladaate hai
 He said, "we want to send a message to the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh that the more you fight us, the more we will increase love and interaction with the people
" " unhone kaha ki modi ne kaledhan ke khilaaf ladaai kii aad main notebandi jaisaa janvirohi nirnay karke puure hindustan ko line main khadaa kar diya, lekin is kadam se kitna kaala dhan baahar aayaa, iskaa koi hisaab nahin diya
 Rahul said that there was no 'suit boot thief' standing in the queues outside banks and atms after demonetisation
 ab modi sarkaar ne cashles pranali kii shuruyaat kar di he jo kisaanon, garibon or mazdooron kii samaj se pare he
 If Modi can do anything in the remaining two and a half years, then forgive the entire debt of the farmers
 congress upaadhyaksh ne kaha ki modi ne udyogpatiyon kaa ek lakh 40 hajaar karod rupee karj maaf kiya he or ab phir se apane chahete pariwaron ke chah lakh karod rupee maaf karne main lage hai

 baatcheet kaa rasta hamaari ore se khulaa he lekin lagata he ki sarkaar adiyal bani hui he
 He said that the government does not want to bring strict laws

 The scamsters are getting protection from the policies of the government
 bhrashtachar rokane ke liye sakht kanoon kii jarurat he
 Prashant said that the people sitting in Parliament are asking us with which authority we are talking, whether the people of this country do not have the right to ask questions
 ye log chaahate hai ki ek baar chun liye jane ke baad netaa manamaani karte rahen or janata khamosh rahe
 Is this democracy? unhone kaha ki sansad kii bhaavana ke mutabik ek prastaav paarit kiya gaya
 The Prime Minister wrote a letter acknowledging Anna's demands
 iske baavjood satr main sarkaar jaanboojhkar kamjor lokapal laa rahi he
 After millions of people hit the road, the government has brought a bill of their choice
 unhone kaha ki sibiai kaa lagaataar durupyog kiya ja rahaa he

 However, Chief Minister Manjhi considered this training very important for himself

 In Jharkhand, the Naxalites openly hoisted the tricolor on Independence Day, ignoring the warning of Chief Minister Raghubar Das
 itnaa hi nahin unhone is photo ko soshal media ke jariye viral bhi kar diya
 Earlier, the CM warned the Naxalites of the state to surrender
 latehar main 2 din pehle hi ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue jharkhand ke siem raghubar das ne kaha tha ki naksali sarender kar den, varanaa aasmaan main bhi chupe honge to bhikhoj kar maarenge
 Although Naxalites usually boycott Independence Day and hoist black flags, this is the first time that an organization associated with Naxalites celebrated the Independence Day by hoisting the tricolor

 Many questions arose on the political upheaval of Maharashtra, the information of which is now coming out

 The story begins at 11:45 pm when Ajit Pawar endorses the deal with the BJP
 isaki soochna party pramukh ko devendra fadanvis dete hai or shapath grahan kii taiyaari kii jaankaree congress or shivasena ko naa ho iskaa intjaam karte hai
 Earlier, the Governor had canceled his visit to Delhi

 Notification of removal of President's rule was issued by the Governor but it was announced at 9 am
 subah 7:50 baje shapath grahan shuru ho gaya
 BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra followed by NCP Legislature Party leader Ajit Pawar sworn in as Deputy Chief Minister
 subah 8:16 baje pradhanmantri narendra modi ne maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ko twitor ke jariye badhai di
 This was followed by a press conference by Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut and he presented Ajit Pawar as the culprit for the entire story
 sanjay raut ne kaha ki ajit pavaar par pehle se hi andeh tha
 They were not talking with eyes in the night meeting
 jiske man main galat karne kii baat hoti he uski body lagvange dikhne lagati he
 Sins are committed in the dark of night
 sanjay raut ne kaha ki ajit pavaar ne maharashtra kii janata or shivaji maharaj ke vichaaron ke saath vishwasghaat kiya he
 Cheated with Sharad Pawar
 Congratulations to @dev_fadnavis Ji and @ajitpawarspeaks Ji on taking oath as the CM and Deputy CM of Maharashtra respectively
 i am confident they will work diligently for the bright future of Maharashtra
 udhar bijepi netaa kaa kahana tha ki shivasena janata ke janadesh ke saath chal kar rahi thi
 The public had given the mandate to the coalition but they were trying to form an alliance with the Congress
 yah janadesh kaa apmaan tha
 The state needs a stable government which Congress cannot deliver

 ab log kis par vishwaas karenge? ensipi netaa sharad pavaar kaa kahana he ki bijepi ke saath sarkaar bananaa ensipi kaa nirnay nahin he, yah ajit pavaar kaa nirnay he
 Ajit Pawar's decision to support the BJP to form the Maharashtra Government is his personal decision and not that of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)
 We place on record that we do not support or endorse this decision of his
 Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, while targeting the BJP, said what was the need to cover up what happened in Maharashtra, thus the sudden withdrawal of President's rule and thus swearing oath is what morality? In which direction are these people taking democracy in the country? When the time comes, the countrymen will answer this and teach the BJP a lesson
 maharashtra main jo hua vah chhipakar karne kii kya aavashyaktaa thi, is prakaar achaanak raashtrapati shashan kaa hatana or is prakaar shapath dilaanaa kaunsi naitikta he? In which direction are these people taking democracy in the country? When the time comes, the countrymen will answer this and teach the BJP a lesson
 kuch sawaal bhi uth rahe hai jiskaa jawaab aane vaale samay main hi mil paaegaa, jaise- kya ensipi ke sabhi vidhayak bijepi sarkaar ko samarthan denge? kya ensipi party tut jaaegi? kya pavaar parivaar main daraar aa gai he? philhal maharashtra main bijepi kii sarkaar ban gai he or ensipi vidhayak dal ke netaa ajit pavaar ne rajya ke upmukhyamantri ke taur par shapath le lee he

 You are not given the same name as Captain Cool, you are like this from the beginning

 You have always surprised everyone with your experiment
 tum bharat ke hi nahin duniya ke sarvshereshth captainon main shumaar ho
 We have seen you as a mature captain with a young Dhoni with big hair and have learned something new from you every time

 At the Wankhede Stadium in the finals, your sixes will resonate for years
 us chakke ke baad tumhaare chehre par santushti kaa jo bhav tha wo hamaare jahan main hameshaa taaja rahegaa
 You also made us the winner in the Champions Trophy
 team india kisi bhi sthiti main par tumko har paristhiti se nipatna aata he
 Dhoni is so confident of you that when you take a referral, we do not even wait for the decision of the third umpire and say that the referral will be out by Dhoni
 lekin semifinal main ravindra jadeja kii gend par tumne refral liya
 However, you did not appear to be the Confidant and we had only agreed that Steve Smith had survived and something similar happened
 dhoni tumne indian cricket ko itnaa kuch diya he ki aalochanaon or tarifon se tum upar uth chuke ho

 You were the winner, and always will be
 pehali baar koi hollywood diarector bollywood ke liye film bana rahaa he, aise main utsukata to bahut thi
 People also wanted to experience how Chuck Russell would serve his ability among the Indian audience
 vaise bollywood or jaanwaron kaa to bahut purana naata rahaa he
 There have been many films that revolve only around animals
 kaaphi saalon baad bollywood main haathiyon ko lekar film junglee banaai gai he
 So will Chuck Russell make us the larger than life experience of Hollywood films? Let's know, how is the film Junglee, which is directed by famous American director Chuck Russell
 kahaneehathi ke daant kii taskari ek aisa dhandha ban gaya he jis par aaj bhi puri tarah lagaam nahin lag pai he
 It is growing well in the business market
 chak rasel ke nirdesan main bani junglee bhi isi mudde ko uthaane kaa prayaas karti dikhi he
 Dipankar Nair is a man who loves elephants a lot
 wo apni patni ke saath milakar chandrika elephant centuri kholta he
 Many elephants are sheltered there
 ab ek din dipanakar kii patni kii maut cancer ke chalate ho jaati he
 After this, Dipankar's son Raj (vidyut Jamwal) leaves his father and goes to Mumbai
 wo vahaan ek janaa mana jaanwaron kaa doctor ban jaataa he
 But when Raj comes to visit his father on the tenth anniversary of his mother, he realizes that everything has changed in Chandrika Elephant Century
 yahaan ab shikariyon kaa bolbalaa he
 An international poaching racket has been established here
 roj kai saare hathi in shikariyon ke dwaara maare jate hai
 Now Raj cannot see his father's dream shattering
 to kya raaj is centuri ko bachaa paaegaa, kya in maasoom haathiyon kii jaan bachegi, kya ye avaidh racket rukegaa or sabase bada sawaal kya raaj in haathiyon kaa badla le paaegaa
 To know all these things, you have to go to see Chuck Russell's film
 chak rasel ne junglee ke madhyam ek gambhir mudda to uthaaya he, lekin film dekhakar lagata he wo apane udeshy main puri tarah safal hote najar nahin aae hai
 a serious issue like smuggling in the wild was raised, but the film does not throw light on its solution
 thailand ke jangalon main shoot kii gai is film main kahani kam or ection seens zyada dekhe ja sakate hai
 This film definitely shows us the beautiful views of the forest, but due to the weak story, that color does not freeze
 actingvidhyut jamwaal ne khud ko is industry main ection hero ke rup main sthapit kar liya he
 After Commando and Commando 2, he is now seen doing dangerous stunts even in the wild
 unhone puri film main kai baar marshall art kaa prayog kiya
 So you can say that Vidyut entertained the audience with its action packed scenes
 lekin jaraa sochie, film kaa udeshy ye ection seens dikhaanaa tha yaa taskari jaise gambhir mudde ko bal dena
 We are saying this because they are frozen in electric action scenes, but their grip in the intensity scenes is weak
 bade parde par apana debyue kar rahi aashaa bhatta utana prabhavit nahin karti hai
 Let me tell, he is in the role of a journalist in the film
 lekin unka kirdaar patrakarita kam or jabardastee kaa prem prasang karata hua zyada dikhataa he
 Hopefully this model will get better roles to show his talent in future
 akshay oberoi kii baat karen, to unka kaam bhi ausat hi kaha jayega
 He did not appear to be more credible in the role of a forest officer
 film main unka role bhi kaaphi chota he
 If someone's act in the wild brings a smile to the audience's face, then it will be of these elephants
 ji haa, in bejubaan jaanwaron ne apni maasoomiyat se darshakon kaa dil kuch had tak jarur bahalaaya he
 Director Russell has previously directed several superhit films in Hollywood such as The Mask and The Scorpion King
 lekin afsos, junglee ke saath wo aisa nyaay karte najar nahin aae
 His focus was only on action scenes, which led to the film's story deviating from its direction
 unhone mudda jarur acha chunaa tha lekin use mukaam tak pahunchaate hue wo nahin dikhe
 The climax of the film managed to captivate the audience due to the excellent action scenes
 lekin un chand ection seens ke liye itani der tak wet karnaa thodaa mushkil sa ho jaataa he
 By the way, there is also a strong link of wild
 film kii cinemetography laajawab he
 The best scenes of the forest are captured in the camera
 iskaa shrey mark irvin ko jaataa he
 musicjungle music is not very strong
 bas mohan kaanan dwaara gaaya gaya ' dosti' thodaa sukun detaa he
 In that song, the elephant and human relationship is beautifully depicted
 film kaa becoground score uski gati ke mutabik nahin he
 The background score could have been slightly energetic
 to kah sakate hai, chak rasel kii junglee ek baar ke liye bacchon kaa dil bahala sakati he
 But due to its weak story and unsuccessful message, it will not reach that point

 All the forces of evil try to punish her, shame her - but she's lucky enough to have very progressive onscreen in laws
 This is what i love about my show
 We're pushing the envelope in these little ways
 I'd love for more producers and actors to make content that our society needs
 To tell stories that will help to uplift this entire country
 To widen the narrow minds
 To question the norm
 To move ahead with the times
 So her kameez tore and her bra strap was exposed
 So what? Let's normalise these things
 No shame in it yaar
 YES WE WEAR BRAS! And YES WE HAVE BREASTS
 They contain mammary glands - essential in providing nutrition to new born infants
 Other than being aesthetically pleasing they serve a very important function
 And yes they sometimes need a bra to support them through the day
 Bra straps will peek out of our blouses
 
 
 and that's okay
 It's not a shameful thing - don't whisper it to me like i should be embarrassed
 Theek hain yaar, aurat hoon, boobs hain, bra pehenti hoon - thoda dikh gaya toh kya? Tharki nazron se mat dekho yaar
 Ya dekhna hai toh ghoor ke mat dekho
 Be thoda decent guys, learn to respect women
 Learn to respect our bodies, our sexuality - but don't make everything about that
 Anyway too much gyaan is happening, so imma stop
 And i offer you an awkward, boobfull, low light selfie
 To prove my point
 To normalise all this shizz
 Okay peace out now I'm off to bed

 The Supreme Court asked the Center to respond to allegations of former Gujarat Home Minister Amit Shah that he was falsely implicated in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case by the CBI for political reasons
 nyaayamurti aftab alam or nyaayamurti ranjana prakaash desai kii peeth ne sarkaar se shah kii daleelon ko puraa hone ke baad aaropon par pratikriya dene ko kaha
 Shah said that he was implicated because the Center wanted to destabilize the Narendra Modi government
 daleelon ke dauraan varisht vakil ram jethmalani ne shah kii ore se maamle main sibiai ko jaanch kaa nirdesh dene ke sheersh adaalat ke faisle ke sambandh main bhi sawaal uthaaye
 He said that the order should not be considered to exist because a judge in the bench (justice Tarun Chatterjee, now retired) was himself under the purview of the CBI in the Uttar Pradesh Provident Fund case at the time the order was given

 In Uttar Pradesh, there is no possibility of VAT on petrol and diesel
 kisaanon kii karj maafee ke baad yogi sarkaar or dabaav lene ke mood main nahin he
 That is why the government has not received any proposal in this regard from the government
 duusare rajyon ne bhale hi VAT ghataakar petrol or dijal ke daamon main kuch raahat logon ko di ho, lekin uttar pradesh main philhal na to waite ghatane ke asaar hai, na hi petrol or dijal ke daam kam hone ke asaar dikh rahe hai
 No proposal has been sent to the state government so far to reduce VAT in the state's commercial tax department

 After the loan waiver of farmers in the Yogi government, the additional burden of 36 thousand crores has already increased on the government, in such a situation, the state's commercial tax department, whose biggest source of earnings is the VAT of petrol and diesel, that is the new VAT reduced
 Is not in favor of doing

 aise main sarkaar kaa raajnneetik netritv main bhale hi waite kam karne kaa dabaav daal rahaa ho lekin vaanijya kar vibhaag nahin chahta ki waite kam ho
 Some other arguments are being given for not reducing VAT
 For example, in Uttar Pradesh, the amount of VAT on petrol and diesel is fixed, while in many other states, VAT is charged in percentage which is quite high
 upi main petrol par 16
 78 rupees and then 9 on diesel

 Ahmed Shahzad's superb century and disciplined bowling by Junaid Khan helped Pakistan beat South Africa by one run in the second one-day international cricket match to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series

 He also took two wickets in the last over of the innings, but the rest of the bowlers of South Africa had difficulty in stopping the batsmen of the opposing team

 This is the 15th occasion while Steyn dismissed Hafeez in international matches

 Pervez Musharraf returned to the country where he once ruled, under the influence of his popularity on social media (facebook 'likes' and Twitter fans) and under the influence of his party workers
 kaaryakartaaon ne unhen gumraah kiya ki janata unki vaapasi chaahati he
 This misunderstanding led him to the trial in the murder trial
 20 agast ko rawalpindi main aatankwaad nirodhak adaalat main musharraf par 27 disambar, 2007 ko purv pradhanmantri benazir bhutto ke katl kaa iljaam lagaaya gaya
 Government lawyer Chaudhary Azhar said, "musharraf has been charged with murder, criminal conspiracy to murder and help in murder
 ”adaalat ne islamabad ke bahari ilaake main chak shahzad main musharraf ke farmahouse ko hi jail bana diya he
 It is said that he is living peacefully there
 ve televijan dekhte hai, akhbaar padhate hai, cigar pite hai, har shaam scoch ke ghunt bharte hai or sari duniya se sampark main hai
 Political prisoners in Pakistan never get that much pleasure
 general ke paas vakt bhi bahut he
 This means that the trial will begin now
 use puraa hone main barason lag jaaenge or dekhnaa yah hoga ki sarkaar, adaalatein or fouj isamen kitni dilchaspee leti hai
 It is generally not the case that a former president and that old military dictator has to stand in the dock for crimes committed during his reign
 musharraf par iljaam tay hona thos karrwai kii bajaae dikhaava zyada lagata he
 Some people believe that Musharraf's case will cool down as Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary retires this December
 benazir kii hatya ke maamle main musharraf ko sidhe doshi sabit karnaa mushkil he
 But there is no doubt that Musharraf played a cat-and-mouse game for his protection and created such an environment that a person like him was under attack
 pakistan main human ritis watch ke diarector ali dayan hasan kaa kahana he ki 18 aktubar or 27 disambar, 2007 ke bich unka benazir se lagaataar sampark tha
 She expressed the danger of her life and said that Musharraf is using security or lack of it as a weapon of political blackmail
 musharraf kaa maananaa tha or ve aaj bhi apni paidaa kii hui is galatfahami ke shikaar hai ki sirf ve hi pakistan ko 'bachaa’ sakate hai
 Some people call him trapped in confusion and some call him a victim of ego
 lekin ve kitna bhi dikhaava kar len yah sachai nahin chipa sakate ki ve musiibat main hai
 When he returned from exile on 24 March this year, only a few hundred people arrived at the airport to welcome him, mostly from the media
 jaankaar bataate hai ki ve apni party ol pakistan muslim lig (apimail) se is baat se khafa the ki vah hajaaron kii bheed nahin juta saki
 Not only did the courts throw water on their plans to contest the 2013 parliament elections, they could be sentenced to life imprisonment for each of the three charges
 lekin maanavadhikaar kaaryakarta or rajnatik sameekshak maravi sarmad maanati hai ki musharraf par jo kuch guzar rahi he vah uske mukaable bahut kam he jo kuch unhone pakistan ke saath kiya he
 His double game of fighting panic pushed Musharraf into the trough
 sarmad kaa yah bhi kahana he ki unhone ek taraf iesai kii afgaan wing ko khatm kiya or 2001-02 main sena se taliban samarthakon kaa safaya kiya to duusari taraf apni nau saal kii hukumat main kattar majahabi takaton kaa samarthan kiya
 Sarmad says, "his jawal (fall) was the result of a tug of war between the Pakistani military's MI (military intelligence) and the ISI
" ”vakil or musharraf kii siyaasi party ke purv sadsy fawaad choudhary kaa maananaa he ki musharraf par chalaaya gaya mukadmaa kanoon ke saamne nahin tikega
 Fawad has been a lawyer for Musharraf in the trial of Benazir's murder and has seen the evidence being pointed out against him
 unka kahana he, ''sach yah he ki mohatarama benazir kii hatya taharik-e-taliban pakistan (titipi) ke sargana batulla mahsood ke hukum par hui thi
 The same group was also involved in the attacks on Musharraf
 isliye yah baat nahin maani ja sakati ki musharraf ne unheen logon kaa saath diya jo unhen maarane kii sajeesh kar rahe the
 According to him, it is not the responsibility of the President to protect people
 jab benazir kii pakistan piples party (pipipi) ke bade netaaon se sampark kiya gaya to koi bhi record par kuch bhi bataane ko taiyaar nahin tha
 Some said that the party was a party to the lawsuit but it had no effect on its policy
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki pipipi netaa benazir ke kaatilon ko sajaa milte dekhnaa chahenge
 But it seems that the party wants the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) government to put a lot of emphasis in the case, the extent to which the courts are willing to go and what the army ultimately does
 darasal fouj se koi takkar nahin lenaa chahta
 PPP leaders are not ready to raise their heads and say anything
 party ne apni hukumat ke paanch barason main saboot ikattha karne kaa kaam kar diya he
 There is little hope that the party will pressurize the Nawaz Sharif government to pursue the case as it did nothing in its own rule
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan sharif ne kaha tha ki agar ve jeet gaye to musharraf par anuchhed 6 ke tahat gaddari kaa mukadmaa chalaayenge
 Now they are in power and cannot back promise from the fear of public displeasure
 lekin jaankaron ko lagata he ki sharif hukumat or fouj ke rishton main gaiyr-faujee hukumat kaa palada baari rakhane main yakeen rakhte hai phir bhi ve musharraf ke maamle main fouj se bhidenge to bevakoofi hogi
 The courts of PML-N and Pakistan know what could be the result of the army's obstruction
 general musharraf ne 1999 main sharif kii sarkaar kaa takhta palata tha or 2007 main chif justise iftikhar choudhary ko barkhaast kiya tha
 Many people are puzzled as to what is the stand of the army on Musharraf's return and the cases against him
 ab tak fouj ne chuppi saadh rakhi he lekin nijee taur par vah khush nahin he
 Musharraf's protégé and current Army Chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani had asked his mother to persuade her son to return when Musharraf returned to Pakistan
 musharraf kii jaan ko to khatra tha hi saath hi unki vaapasi se rajnatik prakriya main dakhal na dene kii fouj kii chhavi ko bhi nuksaan ho saktaa tha
 This image was created by General Kayani since he became the Army Chief
 aisi afvaahen bhi hai ki mukademon kii pairvi karne waalon ko taqatvar halkon se kahalava diya he ki ve had paar na karen
 PPP President Bilawal bhutto-zardari tweeted on August 20: "the Chief Public Prosecutor had told someone in the bar the night before his assassination that he had enough evidence to hang Musharraf
" agle din keretekar sarkaar ne unki sicurity waapas le lee or unki hatya ho gai
 Bilawal refers to Chaudhary Zulfiqar Ali, a lawyer for the Federal Investigation Agency who was murdered in May 2013
 rajnatik sameekshak aaysha siddika kaa kahana he ki id se kuch din pehle adaalat main aane par musharraf par pathar phenkane vaale kuch vakeelon ko agava karke yatnaa di gai
 When the judges were told about it, they did nothing
 unka kahana he, ''shaayad fouj yah sandesh de rahi he ki apni had paar mat karnaa
 "siddiqua feels that when there is a power to present evidence, no one will point a finger at Musharraf as the government officials may not testify against him
" bahut se logon kaa maananaa he ki musharraf ko pakistan se jane diya jayega
 But there will be no apology or written deal
 kisi vidambnaa he ki saudi arab ke jis shahi khandaan ne 1999 main sharif ko aaazaad karaane ke liye musharraf se pairvi kii thi vahi ab musharraf ke liye sharif se pairvi kar rahaa he
 It is sometimes called a boat on a car and sometimes a car on a boat
