 But the party continued to persuade him and kept on requesting to withdraw his resignation
 haalanki, rahul gandhi bilkul bhi nahin maane or buudhvaar ko twitor par chaar pej kii chitthee likhte hue apane istife kii baat saarvajanik kar di
 Apart from leaving the post of Congress President, Rahul Gandhi also made many announcements
 unhone kaha ki party ko jald se jald adhyaksh pad kaa chunaav karnaa chahie or unki is prakriya main koi bhoomika nahin hogi
 With this, Rahul has been saying for a long time that the new president of the party should be separated from the Gandhi family
 jab tak party nayaa adhyaksh nahin chun leti he, tabatak ke liye party ke varisht netaa motilal vora ko jimmedaari saunpi gai he
 In such a situation, once again the big question is, who will choose the party as its new head
 party main kai vikalpon par gaur kiya ja rahaa he, jinamein varking cameti kii baithak bula nayaa adhyaksh chunanaa ho yaa phir kisi aisi cameti kaa gathan karnaa ho jo party kaa netritv kar sake

 main is kaam main unka puraa sahyog karuunga
 My struggle will never go in vain

 rahul gandhi ne haar kii jimmedaari lete hue istife kii peshkash kii thi to kai netaaon par naaraazgi bhi vyakt kii thi
 He said that no leader who claimed responsibility for the defeat emerged after he offered his resignation
 haalanki, rahul gandhi ke itnaa kehane ke baad hi saikadon netaaon ne apane pad se istipha saunp diya tha
 But no big leader was involved in them either
 madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri kamalnath, rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot samet party ke kai bade netaa rahul gandhi se milakar unhen manaane kii koshish kar chuke the, lekin rahul gandhi ne kisi kii bhi suni

 An era of Hindustani classical music has come to an end, but the pioneer of this era, Bharatharatna Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, has reached the height of the melody that these vowels will float in the winds for ages
 
 
 apni suramayi aawaaj se harsh or vishaad, donon hi bhaavon main jaan daalkar shrotaaon ke dil main gaharaai tak paith bana lene vaale pandit ji un mahanatam kalakaaron main shaamil hai, jinhone shastreey gayan hi nahin, halke shastreey sangeet, bhakthi sangeet or anya vividhtapurna sangeet main bhi apni amit chhap chodi, halanki vah kiraanaa gharaane kaa pratinidhitiv karte the
 
 
 His powerful voice undeniably played an important role in making Panditji the most popular Hindustani classical singer
 
 
 chaaturya or junun ke sangam ne hi joshi ji ko un anya shastreey gayakon se alag sthaan diya, jo apni gharaana samskruti se hi jude rahete the, jisase unki rachanaatmakataa baadhit ho sakati thi
 
 
 Born on February 4, 1922 in Gadag in Dharwad district of Karnataka, Joshi had a passion for music since childhood
 
 
 vah sangeet seekhney ke uddeshy se 11 saal kii umr main guru kii talash ke liye ghar se chale gaye
 
 
 By the way, when he was at home, even at the age of playing, he started playing his grandfather
 
 
 sangeet ke prati unki deewangi kaa alam yah tha ki gali se guzarati bhajan mandali yaa sameep kii masjid se aati azaan kii aawaaj sunakar bhi vah ghar se baahar daud padate the
 
 
 Joshi left home and went to Gadag railway station to search for Guru
 
 
 mudi-tudi kameez or hafpant pahane pandit ji tikat liye bina train main baithe or bijapur pahunch gaye, jahaan aajeevika ke liye vah bhajan gane lage
 
 
 Meanwhile, a music lover advised him to go to Gwalior
 
 
 unhone salah ko mana, lekin train ko lekar kuch gafalat ho jane ke chalate vah maharashtra kii samskruti ke dhani pune shahar pahunch gaye
 
 
 There he requested eminent classical singer Krishnarao Phoolambarikar to teach him music, but Phulambarikar demanded a monthly fee, which was not possible for the boy, whose guardian had filed a complaint with the Gadag police station on his disappearance
 
 
 joshi ji niraash hue, lekin unka manobal nahin tutaa, or vah pune se mumbai chale aae
 
 
 From there, the search for the Guru eventually took him to Gwalior, the center of Hindustani music, which was his real destination
 
 
 gwalior ke maharaj ke sangrakshan main rah rahe sarod ustad hafiz ali khan kii madad se yuva joshi ne madhav sangeet vidhyalay main pravesh liya, jo un dinon agrani sangeet santhaan tha
 
 
 While learning the technical aspects of singing, Joshi imbibed the nuances of khyal
 
 
 khyaal gayan ko gwalior gharaane kii hi dein mana jaataa he
 
 
 Pandit Joshi lent his voice as a Dhrupad singer in a Bengali film based on Tansen's life and then also showed his singing talent for the Marathi film Gulacha Ganapathi
 
 
 unhone hindi filmon - basant bahaar or bhairavi main bhi apni aawaaj kaa jaadu bikheraa
 
 
 Due to the influence of Panditji's saint voice and Marathi devotional music, his voice reached the doorstep of Maharashtra and Karnataka
 
 
 unhen 1972 main padmashri, 1975 main hindustani shastreey sangeet ke liye sangeet naatak academy puraskaar, 1985 main padmabhushan or 1992 main madhya pradesh sarkaar ke tansen sammaan se sammanit kiya gaya, tathaa phir varsh 2008 main bharataratna se vibhooshit kiya gaya
 
 
 Pandit Joshi underwent brain tumor operation in 1999 and cervical spine operation in 2005
 
 
 pandit ji ne varsh 2007 main savai gandharva vaarshik sangeet samaaroh main apni saarvajanik prastuti se logon ko abhibhoot kar diya tha, jo samaaroh apane guru kii yaad main unhone hi shuru kiya tha

 Soon after the end of the by-elections in Bihar, the JDU and the RJD announced their candidates for the Rajya Sabha elections to be held on March 23
 argedy ne do nae chehron ko party kaa tikat diya he vahiin jediu ne puraane rajyasabha sadasyon ko hi phir se ripet kiya he
 The party on Sunday announced the name of party spokesperson Manoj Jha and businessman Ashfaq Karim for the 2 Rajya Sabha seats after getting the green signal from RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav
 argedy ke pradesh adhyaksh ramchandra purve ne in donon naamon kii ghoshnaa ravivaar ko kii
 Significantly, for the last few days, there was a lot of discussion on two names of Rajya Sabha from RJD which included the names of senior party leaders Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, Shivanand Tiwari and Jagadanand Singh, but bypassing all these, Lalu Prasad New faces are preferred
 manoj jha or ashfaq kareem kaa rajyasabha ke liye chunaa janaa tay he
 Significantly, Manoj Jha comes from Brahmin society and by giving them tickets, Laloo Yadav has tried to please the upper caste caste in view of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 vahiin duusari taraf jediu ne apane cote ke 2 siton ke liye nae chehron ko naa chunakar puraane chehron ko hi phir se maidan main utaara he
 These include JDU state president Vasistha Narayan Singh and King Mahendra
 donon kii rajyasabha sadsyta agle maheene samaapt hone vaali he
 The BJP has already announced the name of Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad for his 1 Rajya Sabha seat
 yah paanchon ummidavaar somvaar ko apana namakan karenge
 Let us know that elections are to be held for 6 Rajya Sabha seats from Bihar out of which SJDUK 2, RJD 2 and one BJP candidate whose name has been declared are certain to be elected
 maamla chhathi seat ko lekar fansata dikhaai de rahaa he
 If the NDA alliance did not field any candidate for the sixth seat and the Congress mlas did not cross-vote, then this seat would go to the Congress account

 The overwhelming mandate in favor of Narendra Modi in the current Lok Sabha elections has added a new chapter in Indian electoral history
 narendra modi ko mili is jeet ne kai record banaae
 Not only did the BJP become the first party to return to power with an absolute majority in 35 years, but with a landslide victory, its vote share also recorded a record increase
 yah parinaam, modi kii lokapriyata ko pratibimbit karne ke alaava, pichley kai varshon main hue bhaajapa ke lagaataar vistaar ko bhi ingit karte hai
 The Bharatiya Janata Party won 303 seats in this election alone, which is 21 more than in 2014
 isse bhi mahatvapurn baat yah he ki bhagava party ne apane vot share main 6 pratishat kii vruddhi kii he
 It is historical in the sense that after 1952 in Indian electoral history no party has been able to increase its vote share at this pace
 pichhlaa record congress ke paas tha jisane 1984 main vot share main 5 pratishat kii vruddhi darj kii thi
 However, the 1984 elections were held against the backdrop of Indira Gandhi's assassination and the Congress was riding on votes received as sympathy
 1984 se pehle, do baar aisa dekhne ko mila jab ek party ne apane vot share main vruddhi kii
 First in 1957 under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru and second time in 1971 under the leadership of Indira Gandhi
 haalanki, donon baar congress ke voton main badhotaree hui or donon baar vot share main vruddhi 3 pratishat thi
 It is important to note that the Congress dominated in this period of Indian politics
 lekin ab samay badal gaya he or sabase puraani party ab apane purv swaroop kii chaaya maatr rah gai he
 For the first time in India's electoral history in 2014, the bjp's vote share was higher than the Congress
 haalanki, 1998 or 1999 main bhaajapa kii aguwai vaali endie ne centre main sarkaar banane main safal to rahi, lekin uskaa vot share congress se kam rahaa
 Increase in vote share for BJP is not new because even before this three occasions came when saffron party jumped in terms of vote share with the support of other parties
 1991 main, mandal raajnneeti ke charam par hone ke dauraan bhaajapa ke voton main 9 fisadi kii badhotaree dekhi gai thi, jab ve 11 pratishat se 20 pratishat tak pahunch gaye the
 The second time he got 6 percent more votes in 1998 and in 2014 his vote share increased by 12 percent
 haalanki, is chunaav main bhaajapa ke liye voton main 6 pratishat kii vruddhi adhik mahatvapurn he kyonki yah na keval kisi ek party ke liye sabase adhik vruddhi he, balki isliye bhi he kyonki bhaajapa pashchim bengal or odisha jaise rajyon main bhi badhat banane ke saath jabardast raajnneetik ulatpher karne main bhi kaamyaab rahi, jahaan kuch samay pehle tak isaki ginati sabase kamjor partiyon ke rup main hoti thi

 What house, what building, what carts, what farm-barn and what humans
 jo bhi iske raste main aayaa vahi tabah ho gaya
 The speed of the waves is so fast that before the people realized it, they would shed them and turn them into debris
 laharon ke bich main ghar, gadiyaan bah rahi he dub rahi hai
 These unbridled waves took over the entire colony
 log jaan bachaane ke liye gharon se bhaage, sadakon ko choda, pahaado par panaah lee
 Keep asking for help, but when the entire area becomes a sea, where will the helpers reach from? What used to be a happy area of chamoli district till yesterday, now its water is all around
 bas nishaani ke taur par bache-khuche ujde ghar bache hai
 The photographs bear witness that the entire area has been turned into rubble
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki ilaake ke longon kaa kya hua? to philhal khabar yahi he ki hajaaron log gum hai
 Where are you and how are you
 pataa nahin
 But this dreadful picture of destruction is scaring everyone with the same fear
 gussai lehren thamane or malba hatane ke baad
 The doom was just a few minutes
 par us qayaamat se ubarne main uttarakhand ko saalon lag jaaenge
 It takes centuries to settle and decorate each colony
 par ujadane main faqat chand minute
 Tumatmai waves engulfed in an angry cloud have wiped out the names of many districts and settlements in Uttarakhand
 ek ashiana banane main puri jindagi biit jaati he
 So just think how long it would have taken to settle the entire colony? How the settlement settles and in how much time it does not show
 par ek puri kii puri basti kaise or kitni der main barbaad ho sakati he kaise us basti kaa namonishaan mitaa saktaa he ye is pralay main jarur dikhaa
 The creepy waves of the river did not carry any garbage with them, but uprooted the entire habitat
 sadiyon se qudarat ne jab-jab apana tevar badla to tabaahi ke aise nishaan chode jo ek pal main insaan or insaani bastiyon ko mitaa gaye
 The havoc of nature, many times, silenced countless lives forever
 maasoom or begunaah kudarti kahar ke aage bebas or laachaar najar aae
 Nature has been wreaking havoc every time and humans have been devastated
 kyonki kudarat kii takat par insaani kanoon kaa bas nahin chalata
 Forgive me, but even if nature had come under the purview of human law and it would have been possible for humans to punish nature, it would not have been known how many times they would have been punished
 uttarkashi main ganga kinare bane chaar manjila imaarat main kal tak insaan basate the
 The entire family used to learn
 lekin 16 june kii subah hote-hote ganga ne wo vikaraal rup dhaaran kar liya ki ye makaan taash ke patton kii tarah dhah gaya
 It is good that the Uttarkashi administration and the surrounding people, due to which the people living in this building were evacuated before the accident
 ye baat he 16 june kii subah kareeb saat baje kii
 The waves of the Ganges were continuously weakening the foundation of this building
 yahaan rahanevaale log bhale hi is makaan ko pehle hi khaali kar chuke the
 But for a lifetime, the people who built this house by adding straw and straw were eyeing their deposits with helplessness
 lekin aakhirkaar wo vakt bhi aayaa, jiskaa dar sabhi ko tha
 First, a small part of this house was broken by falling into the Ganga and then the next moment, the whole building collapsed and fell into the Ganges
 kudarat ke is gusse ke aage aakhir kiskaa jor chalata
 So, everyone just kept watching this scene of destruction as a spectacle
 lekin barish or ganga kaa gussa abhi baaki tha
 In the form of drops from the sky, the catastrophe continued to descend and the Ganges continued to grow with each passing moment
 ek vakt aisa bhi aayaa, jab assighat par maujuud is mandir kii diwaaren pani ke thapedo se kamjor hone lagi
 When priests and devotees made a distance from the temple, how could God be released? lihaaza, is mandir main sthapit bhagwaan shankar kii murti bhi hataa lee gai or agle hi pal vikaraal laharon ne is chote se mandir ko bhi leel liya
 The swollen rivers and the rocks flowing along these rivers have created the condition of the vehicles, which can be seen from the destruction here
 kai jagahon par to raahat ke dauraan achaanak ai baadh ne jesibi mashin or trakon tak ko apni chapet main le liya
 This condition did not last in just one area of uttarakhand
 puure soobe main ab tak kitni gaadiyaan bahi yaa barabaad hui, iskaa pakke taur par koi aankada to philhal kisi ke paas nahin he
 But according to a rough estimate, more than 300 four wheelers and larger vehicles have been washed away so far
 insaanon kii ginati honi abhi baaki he
 The plot was clouded by the disaster
 badalon ke bich jhagada tha
 The land had to be devastated
 gussa upar aasmaan main phuta
 The swamp came down to the ground
 kudarat kaa kahar to apana kaam kar chukaa
 The township has been destroyed
 ab kuch bachaa he to bas barbaadi kaa manjar
 The scene in which humans and God are all visible
 jin bhagwaan shankar ne kabhi gangaji ko apni jataaon main dhaaran kar is prithvi kii raksha kii thi, kaliyug main usee gangaji ke prachand veg ke saamne bhagwaan shankar kii ye murti ab duubati hui najar aa rahi he
 The terrible rains in the foothills of the Himalayas including Uttarakhand and Himachal, for more than the last 50 hours, have not only changed the life of human beings, but it seems that Ganga should also take this human idol in Rishikesh with them
 Wants to go lekin ganga, bhagirathi, alaknanda, pataal ganga or pinder jaisi in nadiyon kaa gussa insaanon par yun hi najil nahin hua
 Rather, there was a sky-like conspiracy behind it, which forced these rivers to flow beyond their plains
 jaankaron kii maane to hindustan main monsoon ne 16 june ko hi apni pehali dastak di, lekin himalay ke upar monsooni hawaaen isse ek din pehle yani 15 june ko hi pahunch chuki thi
 On the other hand, this time it is a coincidence that a western disturbance, ie Western disturbance born from the Mediterranean Sea, suddenly hit the sky of India and what happened when these two winds hit the top, there was devastation
 is takkar kaa nateeja ye hua ki badal ek nahin, balki kai jagah fate or asaman se pani kii wo dhar utari, jisane nadi to nadi, raaston or aabaadi ko bhi nadiyon main tabdeel kar diya
 
 
 As a result of the incessant rains in Kinnaur, Himachal Pradesh, 8 people lost their lives by getting trapped in it, while more than 15 hundred tourists arrived in the nearby hill areas to enjoy the weather, where they were trapped went
 uttarakhand ke uttarkashi, joshimath, chamoli, pithauragarh, tehri, rudraprayag, or paudi jaise ilaakon main naa maaloom kitne hi raste, kitne hi pul, kitni hi gaadiyaan bah gayi or kitne hi makaan janmidoj ho gaye
 Moreover, JCB machines, trucks and other vehicles used for relief work also got absorbed in the waves
 akele hemkund sahib main 200 bike or 80 alag-alag gaadiyaan ufanti alaknanda nadi kaa shikaar ban gayi
 Along with the rain, due to subsidence the land also got worse
 badrinaath or kedarnath ke raste main kai jagahon par sadaken aise gaayab huin ki dekh kar samajhnaa mushkil ho gaya ki in jagahon se kabhi log or gaadiyaan bhi guzarati hongi
 Now the situation is that the government has asked for help from everyone from ITB to the army and efforts are being made to make the roads operational again with the evacuation of people from place to place
 lekin halaat kab saamaanya honge, ye daawey se koi bhi nahin bataa saktaa
 It is called a cloud of trouble
 jis chamoli or dhanolti main khubsuurati or sakuun pasra tha, vahaan aaj dehshat faili hui he
 After the death, the water stopped all the ways of relief and the tourists reached there are stranded
 chamoli jile main govindghat par alaknanda main itnaa pani aa gaya he ki nadi kii dhara garajte hue puri raftaar se bah rahi he
 Due to landslides, the road was closed and a large number of passengers got stuck here
 yahaan se 18 kilometre dur joshimath he
 The pilgrims were rushed to Joshimath on foot
 chamoli, uttarkashi, kedarnath, badrinath, tehri, rudraprayag, paudi, dehradun, pithauragarh or nainital jilon main kai ilaake baari barish kii bhayankar maar jhel rahe hai
 The situation has deteriorated so much that more than 200 two-wheelers and about 80 other small vehicles got into the Alaknanda stream
 ek pul, 5 hotel or yahaan tak ki ek helicopter bhi nadi main bah gaya
 In the Hemkund mountain valley, more than 5000 people have lost their lives
 bijli or telephone sevaayen tabah ho chuki hai
 Meanwhile, a cloudburst in Dhanaulti over Mussoorie has trapped about 400 tourists
 koun kahaan he or kis haal main he kahana mushkil he
 Those who were going on a trip to Hemkund Sahib or returning from there, they do not know when they will be able to get out of this trouble, because they saw with their eyes the fearful scene
 uttarkashi main ek mandir tufaani sailaab ke agosh main samaa gaya
 Here the stream of Ganges is furious, intent on wiping out whatever comes in its way
 ek 4 manjila imaarat yahaan pehle hi pani main girakar mit chuki he
 And the rain is not taking that name of pause
 musiibat kii is ghadi main sena raahat or bachaav ke kaam main kud padi he
 The army has set up camps in Uttarkashi, Joshimath, Rudraprayag, Govindghat, Hanumanchetti and Dharchula where efforts are being made to provide food, drink and treatment to the passengers
 sena ne fanse hue yatriyon kii sahaayta ke liye helpline number muhaiyaa kara die hai
 These numbers are 1800 180 5558 and 1800 419 0282
 in numberon par sampark karke, sena kii madad hasil kii ja sakati he
 Also, families whose people have gone on a trip to Uttarakhand can also get news of their people on the helpline
 haalanki uttarakhand ke pahaado par ai is pralay main jagah-jagah telephone network bhi dhwast ho gaye hai

 The Financial Express reports that a group of ministers met under the chairmanship of Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday
 isamen BSNL or MTNL jaisi saarvajanik kshetra kii companiyon ko patari par laane ke upayon par vichaar kiya gaya
 Now the days of government to earn money by selling spectrum are over
 ab isaki sambhaavna bahut kamazor ho chuki he ki sarkaar telikam spectrum adhik daam par bechakar khazaana bhar sakegi
 The question before the government is whether to put money in these companies or be closed
 ek vikalp he ki BSNL or MTNL ko 4 ji spectrum de diya jaae
 But even these companies will not come back on track
 BSNL ne aakhri baar 2008 main munafa kamaaya tha
 Since then this company has incurred a loss of 82,000 crores
 disambar 2018 tak yah aankada 90,000 karod ke paar ja saktaa he
 66 per cent of its revenue is being spent on its employees, which was 21 per cent in 2006 and 27 per cent in 2008
 privet telikam companiyon main karmchaariyon par rajasav kaa 5 pratishat hi karch hota he
 BSNL once had cash reserves of 37,200 crores
 aaj yah 8600 karod ke ghate main he
 On this, Financial Express editor Sunil Jain tweeted that the only way to get 80 per cent employees removed
 is 80 fisadi main kai hazaar karmchaaree aate hai
 Business Standard has an article by k Bhattacharya
 2014 main jab manmohan singh ne sarkaar chodi tab karmchaariyon kii sankhya 34
 5 lakh
 modi sarkaar ne teen saal tak shandaar kaam kiya or karmchaariyon kii sankhya ghataakar 32
 3 lakhs
 karmchaariyon kii sankhya ghataane kii taareef kii gai he
 Bhattacharya is writing that the Modi government reduced the workforce by 4 percent in 2014-15
 magar uske baad karmchaariyon kii sankhya ghataane kii raftaar kam hoti chali gai
 Yet within three years the incident numbering 2
5 lakh employees was a spectacular achievement
 phir bhi modi sarkaar sarkari karmchaariyon kii sankhya ghataane main vaajapeyi sarkaar ke aage kahin nahin thaharti he
 The Vajpayee government had reduced its workforce by 13 percent in 2000-01
 2011-12 main manmohan singh ne 6
 There was a cut of 2 percent
 lekhak ko chintaa he ki modi sarkaar ne apni uplabdhiyon ko aakhir ke do saal main pani pher diya
 When the number of government employees started increasing
 2018-19 tak aate aate sarkari karmchaariyon kii sankhya 36 lakh se adhik ho gai
 AK Bhattacharya is worried about this
 iskar vibhaag, police, railway or naagarik suraksha main aakhri saal main do lakh se adhik karmchaaree bhartee kiye gaye
 There was 99,000 vacancies in the railway
 e ke bhattacharya hindi news kii duniya se nahin he varna ve prime time kii naukari series ko bhi doshi tehraate ki maheenon dikhaane se sarkarein dabaav main aa gayi or chunaav ko dekhte hue bhartiyon niklane lageen
 i escaped
 itane par bhi lekhak is sawaal kaa jawaab puch rahe hai ki kya chunaav ke kaaran aisa kiya gaya
 Because of the election, it was done only when the youth voted for the Modi government
 naukari mili or naukari milane kii ummid main
 The anger of the jobs that did not come out in the first three years was increasing
 aakhri vakt main bhartiyon nikaalane se yuvaaon kii naaraazgi kam hui
 AK Bhattacharya should have asked the question whether the youth do not want jobs in the first three years
 ye or baat he ki is sawaal se yuvaaon ko fark nahin padataa he
 Even if they vote for Prime Minister Modi, a writer should stand in his favor
 naukari ke yaa naukari kii katautee ke
 It should be asked what caused the misery of the public sector companies, and who got the benefit of it, who will get profit by selling it
 lekhak ne likhaa he ki modi sarkaar ne ek saarvajanik company kii hissedari duusari saarvajanik kshetra kii company ko bechakar do lakh karod se adhik kii kamai kii magar nijeekaran nahin kiya
 Manmohan Singh also earned 90,000 crores but did not privatize
 aaj saarvajanik kshetra kii companiyaan charmara gayi hai
 His job has lost its sheen
 bainkon kii bhi ho gai he
 Writing all this does not mean that the employees from the bank to the public sector will be anti-modi or were, but economic processes have to be recorded
 main khud jaanata hum ki bank sector ke logon ne modi sarkaar ko puraa samarthan diya he
 The question should be asked whether this time the Modi government will show favor on these employees, excited by this support? Read the business newspapers
 unamem isaki vakaalat kii ja rahi he ki karmchaariyon ko nikaala jaae
 The burden of government expenditure should be reduced
 tabhi kahata hum ki hindi ke pathakon ko bijness kii khabaron ko samajhnaa chahie
 The circumstances also have to be understood before blindly opposing this argument
 aaj sarkaar ke paas paise nahin he
 She is not able to give profits to consumers from the bonds she has issued to earn
 ab vah videshon se band kharidne ja rahi he
 The economic condition of the world is not good
 agar videshon main band bechakar paisa nahin aayaa to sarkaar ke saamne kya chunautiyaan hongi
 It has to be understood
 bijness standard lagaataar report kar rahaa he ki saarvajanik kshetra kii companiyon or privet companiyon kaa munafa ghatata ja rahaa he
 The burden of their debt is increasing
 sabhi saarvajanik kshetra kii companiyon kaa kul cash 12
 Reduced by 8 percent
 unka karza 13
 Has increased by 5 percent
 in companiyon main sarkaar kii hissedari hi adhik he
 So the government will suffer losses
 in companiyon kaa vailu kam hoga, bechney par bhi daam kam milenge
 Then the deficit of the government will increase further
 bijness standard apane sampadakeey main sarkaar ko shrey detaa he ki usne in companiyon ko sanbhaalane kii baat kii he
 It has said that it will undertake strategic disinvestment
 lekin sarkaar sara jor vinievesh ke zarie cash hasil karne par na de balki in companiyon ko aaj ke bazaar se kamai karne ke liye sakasham banaae
 The days ahead are challenging
 agar is prakriya main deree hui to naukariyaan or kam hongi
 Those who have them will be spoiled
 selary nahin badhegi or ulta ja bhi sakati he
 This should not happen to anyone
 aaj ke hi akhbaar main chapa he ki suzalon company ne 172 million dollar lone ke diphalt kaa elaan kiya he
 Now it will affect the banks
 aaj kal lakh, karod likhane kaa chalan band ho gaya he
 The government has also started speaking million and trillion
 bijness standard main yah bhi khabar he ki sarkaar ne jo band jari kiye hai unka ritern 30 maheene main sabase kam he
 Meanwhile, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur has told in the Rajya Sabha that 17,651 crore npas of Mudra loans have been made
 pratishat main to 2 pratishat hi he lekin 17,651 karod kaa enpie kam nahin hota he
 The minister has also given reasons
 bijness fail ho gaya
 The lending process was not followed properly
 ab mantri yah to nahin bataaenge ki bainkon par mudra lone dene kaa dabaav daalaa gaya
 Loans were made with the help of political intervention at the local level
 bijepi yah to bataati he ki mudra lone dene se kitnon ko rojgaar mila lekin yah bhi bataa sakati he ki 17,651 karod kaa lone enpie hua, bijness fail hue to kitnon kaa kaam chhin gaya
 Enable yourself in financial news
 isse behatar samaj milegi ki aapkaa bhavishya kis disha main ja rahaa he
 There are challenges before the government but there is no concern in its language
 honi bhi nahin chahie
 The public does not understand the economic consequences nor does it build public opinion on the basis of it
 bhale hi naukariyaan na ho, lekin jai shri ram bolkar raajnneeti kaa tone set to kiya hi ja saktaa he
 It is also a successful formula
 is sawaal par sochie kabhi ki aakhir hindi jagat main in khabaron par charchaa kyon nahin hoti he
 Why are not good business newspapers
 hote bhi to unamem bhi yahi vakaalat hoti ki sarkaar jaldi se apane karmchaariyon kii sankhya ghataae
 If the number of employees decreased, their editors would write that the government has done a fantastic job
 phir ise hindi kaa pathak or matadaata kaise padhata, kya vah bhi in sampadakon kii tarah swaagat karata he
 These things should reach the towns
 ayodhya ramamandir se bijepi ko mili sanjivani92 main narendra modi rashtriya str par netaa ban chuke theayodhya ke ramamandir or babari masjid vivaad ne bhartiya raajnneeti kii dasha or disha ko hameshaa ke liye badalakar rakh diya he
 BJP got Sanjivani from Ram temple movement
 isi kaa nateeja he ki bijepi aaj centre kii satta se lekar 19 rajyon kii satta par kabiz hokar duniya kii sabase badi raajnneetik party he
 In such a situation, when the decision of the Ayodhya dispute case is coming from the Supreme Court, then Narendra Modi is the Prime Minister of the country
 is naate sawaal uthta he ki jis saal babari vidhwans hua tha to us 1992 main narendra modi ke bare main media main kya likhaa ja rahaa tha
 In the March 1992 issue of India Today, Uday Mahurkar in one of his stories described Narendra Modi as the rise of the new star of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 unhone likhaa tha ki bhaajapa adhyaksh murali manohar joshi kii ekta yatra ke sanyojak 38 varshiyanarendra modi party main mahatvapurn vyakti banateja rahe hai
 And the reason is also there
 jahaan ek taraf yatra kaa vishleshan chal rahaa he vahiin, duusari taraf bhaajapa main charchaa garam he ki yatra ko jari rakhane ke liye laalkrishna adwani or atal bihari vaajapeyi sareekhe diggaj ko raji karne main bhi modi safal rahe
 Not only this, senior BJP leaders keep consulting with Abnendra Modi
 vajah saaf he
 Within a short span of six years, after joining the BJP through the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, he not only became the General Secretary of the Gujarat Party unit but also the important leader of the party at the national level
 us samay narendra modi bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini samiti or sarvashaktimaan chah sadasyeey rashtriya chunaav samiti ke bhi sadsy the
 The committee included senior leaders like LK Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi and Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 mahurkar aage likhte hai ki narendra modi aakarshak hindi naare banane kii apni pratibha se party chhavi nirmaataa ke rup main ubhare hai
 Even Chimanbhai Patel, the smartest player in politics, respects his sharpness
 donon jab bhi aamane-saamne hote hai to chimanbhai unhen khush rakhane kii koshish karte hai
 And they can be an obstacle in the way of BJP leaders who are trying to adopt a soft attitude

 NSG was the issue in the conversation with Jinping
 When asked if India insisted on the need to separate the efforts of India and Pakistan on the membership of NSG, he said, 'you heard that the Prime Minister told Xi Jinping that China should give India 'S application should be evaluated objectively and objectively based on its own merits and China should join the emerging consensus in Seoul'

 Pakistani team manager Intikhab Alam blamed captain Shahid Afridi for the team's poor performance in recent tournaments including T20 World Cup cricket

 In a five-page report sent to the PCB and its committee, Alam said that the team failed to withstand the pressure of the tournament

 He said, "the bowling in the death over was also poor and the same is the condition of batting

 'he said,' We were also surrounded by two unnecessary controversies

 ' unhone kaha, 'deth over main gendbaaji bhi kharaab rahi or yahi haal ballebaaji kram kaa bhi he
 We do not have a reliable pinch hitter who can match us
 ' Alam, who has been associated with Pakistan cricket in different positions for the last three decades, said that Afridi added to the problem by making unnecessary rhetoric in India
 unhone kaha, 'toornament bharat main tha, jahaan team par or dabaav rahata he
 At the same time, the captain did not provide a good sample of leadership ability inside and outside the field in his last tournament
 ' unhone kaha, 'ham do gairajaruri vivaadon se bhi ghir gaye
 First when Afridi said that he loves Pakistan more than in India, and then Umar Akmal demanded Imran Khan's intervention to bat at number three, even though he was not doing well at number four

 Preparing to hand over

 The Railway Ministry has decided in this regard

 This letter also mentions about the work of making 400 railway stations world class
 isamen kaha gaya he ki kai saalon se is tareeke kii baaten kii jaati rahi hai
 But it has not actually been implemented except at ace-dukka stations

 In the midst of all this, with the help of big frenzy, this whole decision is being tried to prove it right
 Ironic that a move ostensibly taken to secure “special interests” of J&K gets cheered on everywhere except in the state that's it meant to benefit
 While people in Kashmir have been gagged, mass hysteria is orchestrated elsewhere to justify this decision

 The PDP leader warned that the BJP should refrain from playing with fire

 Isha Gupta may not be in the news due to her films, but her activity on social media brings her to the headlines
 isha ne haal hi main instagram par aisa video share kiya ki iske kaaran unhen phans kii kaaphi tikhi pratikriya jhelni pad gai
 In the video Isha shared, she is showing her middle finger
 jis tarah ve ishaara kar rahi hai, vah phans ko pasand nahin aayaa
 Users started petrolling them by considering it as offensive
 ek yugers ne yah tak likh diya ki isha ko sabhi ko anfolo kar dena chahie
 One user wrote Isha as the Frustrated Lady, while another wrote - Was it necessary? aisa kyon? ek anya ne likhaa ki yadi aapaki anguli main problem he to aapako doctor ko dikhaanaa chahie
 a user has written that this is what you can do
 isha gupta rustam,commando2, baadshaaho, raaj 3, hamashakls, palaton, chakravyuuh jaisi filmon main najar ai hai
 In March this year, there were reports that Isha could be engaged to her designer boyfriend Nikhil Thampi
 aisa unki instagram story kii vajah se hua tha
 India produces around 1500 films a year
 puri duniya main isaki keval aadhi filmein hi ban paati he lekin iske baavjood apane 100 saal ke cinemai itihaas main hamaara desh ek bhi auskar nahin jeet paaya he
 Indian Angels may have special significance in films like 'slumdog Millionaire', 'life of Pi' and 'gandhi' but it is also a bitter truth that these films were not made by any Indian director
 abhi tak sirf 5 bharatiyon ne auskar jite hai
 These include Bhanu Athaiya, Russell Pookutty, AR Rahman, Gulzar
 iske alaava sathyajith re ko 1991 main auskar seremani main lifetime achievement kaa aword mila tha
 Winning an Oscar for a film is a great way for any small country to get exposure at the global level
 kai deshon main olympic or nobel puraskaron kii tarah hi auskar kii jeet kaa jashn manaaya jaataa he
 President of Sony Pictures Tom Bernard has said that an Oscar nomination is important for a country in many ways and many countries celebrate this victory like a World Cup
 aise main ye jaananaa jaruri ho jaataa he ki 100 saalon ke cinemai itihaas main bharat kii taraf se ab tak ek adad film aisi kyon nahin ban pai he jo desh ko auskar aword dilaa sake
 In fact, barring a few films, most of the films that went to the Oscars from India have been mediocre
 saal 1957 main ai mahaan film madar india auskar jeetne ke sabase kareeb pahunchi thi
 The film missed out on winning the Oscar by just one vote
 iske baad jo film auskars main final paanch main pahunch pai thi unamem 1988 main ai mira nair kii film salaam bombai or aamir khan kii 2001 main ai film lagaan thi
 From 1957 to 2012, India has sent 45 films at the Oscars, of which 30 were from Bollywood but only 8 of them have received National Awards
 madar india ke tees saalon baad tak bharat kii kisi bhi film kaa antim paanch main bhi na pahunch paanaa saaf karata he ki ham apane desh kii behtareen filmein auskar nahin bhej rahe hai
 In the year 1998, the film Jeans was sent for the official entry of the Oscars, while Shyam Benegal's film Summer was an excellent film and also received the National Award
 lekin iske baavjood ek ausat film jeens ko auskar ke liye bheja gaya kyonki us film ke saath aishwarya raay ne apana debyue kiya tha
 Aishwarya had won the title of Miss World and her film got a push at the Oscars due to her global identity
 isi tarah saal 2012 main film barfi ko auskar ke liye bheja gaya tha
 Though the film did well at the box office and is also considered one of Ranbir Kapoor's best films, the film had Charlie Chaplin Marka comedy scenes copied, which made Chance at the Oscars for the film very weak
 usee saal ai vidya baalan kii shandaar thriller 'kahani' or irfan khan kii film 'paan singh tomars' ke behtareen chances the lekin ek baar phir bharat ne ye mauka ganvaa diya tha
 There are many times that the best film from India is sent for the Oscars, but the publicity of this film in the international market is not done properly due to which these films are missed due to lack of good exposure
 bollywood main thode bahut twists ke saath romantic kamedi johnor par hi focus rahaa he or is johnor main auskar str kii filmein bananaa kaaphi mushkil hota he
 In addition, Bollywood's business model is one where filmmaking is compromised on many levels and the film is made only with the local business in mind
 kai baar ye filmein auskar ke str ko chhu bhi nahin paati he
 This is why a large part of Bollywood is focused only on average films
 haalanki beete kuch samay main content besd cinema kaa bolbalaa bharat main badha he or ummid he ki jald hi bharat kaa auskar sookhaa samaapt ho sakegaa

 Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi has claimed that he did not know his true age when he participated in the National Under 14 Trial and this triggered a whole lot of 'misunderstanding' about the issue
 apni aakraamak ballebaaji ke liye pahachaane jane vaale aafridi ne kaha ki jab unhone 1996-97 main naurobi main 37 gendon main shatak jadaa to aadhikarik aankadon ke anusaar unki umr 16 saal thi, lekin asal main vah 19 saal (aatmakatha ‘game changer’ ke anusaar 21) ke the
 Afridi said that he had no qualms about talking about his age in his recently released autobiography and also confirmed that the first edition recorded the wrong year of his birth
 aafridi ne kaha, ‘recordon main meri aayu ko lekar dikkat kaa kaaran yah he ki jab main pehali baar under 14 trial ke liye gaya to mujhe bhi apni asal umr nahin pataa thi
 So when the selectors asked me about my age, i gave them the information that other people gave me
 cricket board ke record main yah aayu aadhikarik rup se darj ho gai or isse galatfahami hui
 He said, "I have no qualms because my record of scoring the fastest ODI century since 1996 was in my name, no matter what my age is
" ’ aafridi kii umr ko lekar bavaal unke aatmakatha ke aane ke baad shuru hua
 In fact, Shahid Afridi uncovered a big lie in his autobiography 'gam Changer' which he had come to hide so far in his cricketing career
 aafridi ne apni aatmakatha main kaha he ki aadhikarik dastavejon main unki galat umr darj he
 According to the website espncricinfo's report, Afridi wrote in his autobiography that he was born in 1975 and not 1980
 pakistan ke purv captain ne haalanki apni janmatithi kaa maheenaa or din nahin bataaya he, lekin isse ek baat sabit ho gai he ki aafridi abhi tak juthi umr ke saath cricket khel rahe the
 Afridi made his debut in international cricket in 1996 when he was said to be 16 years old
 aafridi ne apni aatmakatha main likhaa, 'record main main 19 saal kaa tha na ki 16 saal
 i was born in 1975
 haa adhikariyon ne meri umr galat darj kii thi
 Afridi has further obscured the situation with this statement because on one hand he is saying that he was born in 1975
 is lihaaj se jab unhone padaarpan kiya tab vah 20 yaa 21 saal ke the, lekin vah khud apni kitaab main kah rahe hai ki vah 19 saal ke the
 After this, questions started to arise that why Afridi had kept silence about his age till now and now that he has revealed his real age himself, will the ICC take a decision in this regard? notebandi ke 50 dinon kii seemaa bhale hi khatm ho gai ho, lekin bijepi ke liye notebandi ke baad shuru hui mushkilon khatm hoti nahin dikh raheen
 The BJP and Modi government claim that demonetisation has been successful and now things have become normal, but reports of cash shortage are still coming in small towns and cities
 bijepi ke liye raah aasaan nahinis bich paanch rajyon main hone walevidhansabha sabha chunaavonper iskaa asar hone kii puri sambhaavna he
 Particularly in Goa where the BJP is in government and will cast votes in Kogova on February 4, but the demonetization of the tourism industry after demonetisation may shock the BJP in the coming elections
 bijepi notebandi ko kaledhan ke khilaaf ladaai ke rup main janata ke bich le jaakar votaron ko lubhaane kii koshish karegi lekin notebandi kaa doosraa pahalu bijepi ke liye mushkilen khadaa kar saktaa he
 Tourism in Goa has been badly affected by the problem of demonetisation and cash
 notebandi ke baad se hi goa main touriston kaa akaal padaa he
 Although there was a lot of buzz in Goa on the celebration of the New Year, but this year the demonetisation of the New Year faded compared to every year
 goa kii aay paryaton par nirbhar he or aise main naa sirf rajya sarkaar ko rajasav kaa nuksaan hua balki paryaton se jude har tabake par isaki maar padi
 The impact of demonetisation on the earnings of the people Feroz, 49 years old, lives in a Purvarim in Goa and his employment has been the biggest hit due to demonetisation
 notebandi ke baad se bane halaat se jindagi goa main patari par laut rahi he lekin halaat pehle kii tarah hone main vakt lagegaa
 Firoz used to earn Rs 1000 to 1500 in the first day of demonetisation, but after the lack of cash, his earnings reached 500 to 800 rupees
 firoz kehete hai, ‘pehle kamai zyada thi lekin notebandi ke baad se touriston kaa daawa kam ho gaya isliye hamaari kamai pehle se kaaphi kam ho gai he
 'will it affect the elections? In response to this question, Feroze says that 'whose business has gone bad, he will think before he votes
 ab chunaav par iskaa asar padegaa thodaa bahut lekin kitni padegaa nahin kah sakate
 'not only Feroz, 20-year-old Santosh Mhadik, who sells coconut water on the highway between Panaji and Dabolim, also says that the work that has come to a standstill since demonetisation has not been managed yet
 touriston kii kami se roj kii kamai 700 rupee se ghatakar 400 se 450 rupee pratidin tak ghat gai he
 Santosh is a new voter and is very upset and annoyed with the closure of business
 hotel vyapaar par notebandi kii maarpanji main bada hotel chalaane vaale ribio sequera kehete hai, ‘oktober se lekar farvari tak goa main paryatakon kaa peak sijan hota he, lekin notebandi ke baad hamaara puraa sijan kharaab ho gaya he
 Angered by the government, a staff of 45 people works in the hotel in Sequeira but due to non-arrival of tourists, the empty rooms of the hotel have also emptied the pocket of Rebio Sequera
 puure sijan main lakhon kii kamai hoti thi lekin ab sab kuch prabhavit ho chukaa he or nuksaan bada hua he
 According to Sikwera, people associated with the tourism industry are angry with the BJP government because there was no compensation after the loss
 goa main zyaadaatar hotel peak sijan hone ke baad bhi phul nahin hai isliye tamaam hotel paryatakon ko zyada se zyada chhot de rahe hai jisase thodaa bahut kamai ho jaae
 Obviously, businessmen and people associated with demonetisation can face difficulties for the BJP in the elections after suffering such a huge loss

 After the discussion on the Citizenship Amendment Bill in Rajya Sabha, Amit Shah replied to the questions given by the Union Home Minister Amit Shah introduced the Citizenship Amendment Bill in the Rajya Sabha at 12 noon
 jiske baad is bill par upree sadan main charchaa hui
 After discussion, Home Minister Amit Shah presented his reply before the House
 apane jawaab main amit shah ne kaha ki ek sawaal khadaa hua ki bill main muslim kyon nahin he
 i want to say that there is no appreciation of bringing people of 6 religions, but why is it not being asked as Muslims
 unhone aage kaha ki yah bill ham 3 deshon main alpsankhyakon par jo pratadna hui he unako sharan dekar unke pichley jo kaagaj nahin he phir bhi unako naagarikta dene ke liye laae hai
 When i speak of the word minority, any member of the opposition should tell whether the followers of Islamism in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan will be called minorities or not
 jahaan tak dharmik pratadna kaa sawaal he jab rajya kaa dharm hi islam he tab islam ke anuyaayiyon par pratadna kii sambhaavna bahut hi kam ho jaati he
 If you still have to apply to someone, then they can give them a system of giving citizenship to them as well
 jab ek saamaanya drushti se dekhte hai to yah mana jaataa he ki jahaan islamic state he vahaan islam ke anuyaayiyon par pratadna hone kii koi sambhaavna nahin he isliye is bill main sirf hindu, sikh, buddha, jain, parsi or isai ko rakhaa he
 Shah further said that the secularism of our party was questioned
 hamane kya isamen sirf hindu rakhaa he kya
 Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Parsis are also coming inside it

 Let me tell you that this is a remake of Marathi film Sairat, Ishaan Khattar opposite Jahnavi Kapoor in the role of lead actor in this film
 star athlete krishna punia ne somvaar ko mahilaon kii chakkaa phenk main swarna padak jitkar bhartiya athletics ke nayaa itihaas rachakar rashtramandal khelon main pichley 52 saal se bharat kaa trek evam field main sone kaa tamgaa hasil nahin kar paane kaa myth tod diya
 Poonia is the first Indian female athlete to win the gold in these games
 yahi nahin bharat kii hi harvant cor ne rajat jabaki rashtriya ricarddharak seemaa antil ne kaansya padak jeeta
 This is the first time in the Commonwealth Games, while the first three places were won by Indian players
 bharat kii taraf se isse pehle rashtramandal khelon main swarna padak 1958 main cardiff main udan sikh milkha singh ne 440 gaj kii daud main jeeta tha
 Poonia was considered a strong contender for the gold medal right from the start and this 28-year-old athlete managed to live up to the expectations between the huge support of 30 to 35 thousand spectators at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium
 unhone apane pehle prayaas main 61
 Threw a 51-meter flywheel which remained out of reach of any other athlete until the end
 harvant cor ne tisare prayaas main 60
 Silver medal by throwing 16m flywheel while Seema threw 58 in her second attempt

 In this way, India has so far won a total of seven medals including one gold, three silver and similar bronze medals in athletics so far

 i dedicate this medal to Indians
 ’punia ko is svarnim safalataa ke liye badhai dene waalon main swayan milkha bhi maujuud the
 He greeted Poonia with his hug
 punia haalanki apane is satr ke sarvshereshth pradarshan (63
 69 meters), but this achievement will be written in the golden letters in the history of Indian athletics

 Tintu was in first place for half the distance but was then overtaken by gold medalist Kenya Nancy Laget after which she trailed and finally two minutes 1
 25 second main daud puri kar paayi or is tarah se is satr ke apane sarvshereshth samay ke anuroop bhi pradarshan karne main naakaam rahi
 India's four times 400m women's team only three minutes 32 in T1
 52 second ke samay ke saath pehle sthaan par rahakar final ke liye kwalifai kiya jabaki isi varg main purush team teen minute 6

 Finished first in his heat with a time of 00 seconds to advance to the finals

 apni or apni 12 saal beti ke izzat kii ladai ladane vaali swati singh ab sabhaaon main hunkaar bharne lagi he
 Swati Singh, on whom the BJP wants to bet instead of Dayashankar Singh, is trying to raise herself parallel to Mayawati's rallies with her husband
 mayawati jab 21 agast ko agra main pehali chunavi raily kar rahi thi toswati or dayashankarkanpur or hathras main apni pehali sabha kar rahe the
 Now when Mayawati is scheduled to hold another rally in Azamgarh on August 28, Swati and Dayashankar will hold their second meeting in Ballia
 baliya dayashankar kaa grih jila he
 It was later deferred due to floods
 khulkar saamne ain swati sinhadyashankar singh ke vivaadit bayaan ke baad bispi kii raily main gaali-galouj ke naare par pehali baar swati singh khulkar saamne ai thim
 Then BSP and Mayawati also came on the backfoot due to Swati's challenge
 maheene bhar pehle tak jis swati singh ko koi nahin pahachaanata tha unhen ab puraa pradesh pahachaanata he
 In just one month, Swati Singh is challenging Mayawati
 kshatriya mahasabha ke binar tale ho rahi he reliyanswati singh kii kshamta ko bijepi hi bhaanp chuki he
 People want Swati to contest elections as well
 ek maheene main mili prasiddhi dekhakar uttar pradesh ke kai shaharon main log unki reliyaan karana chaahate hai
 Actually, Swati Singh has made direct preparations to confront Mayawati
 mana ja rahaa he ki iske peeche dimag to bijepi kaa he lekin binar or jhanda kshatriya mahasabha kaa he
 Appealing not to vote for the BSP, Swati Singh makes a point of abusing her 12-year-old daughter and herself in their meetings
 nasimuddin siddkike khilaaf exiaar hone or poxo act lagane ke baavjood koi police karrwai nahin hone ko apni sabhaaon main mudda bana rahi he
 She appeals to the people not to vote for the BSP under any circumstances
 mayawati ko swati ke khilaaf utarane kaa chalenjadyashankar singh is sabha main swati ke mayawati ke khilaaf chunaav ladaane kaa chalange karte hai
 He says that if Mayawati fought the general seat, Swati would contest against him
 azamgarh ke baad mayawati kii raily elahabaad or saharanpur main hogi
 Dayashankar and Swati have also decided to hold meetings around these cities at the same time
 bispi kii raily main lagaae gaye vivaadit naredrasal ye khel vidhaan sabha chunaav ko lekar he
 Dayashankar Singh used objectionable words about Mayawati and Mayawati made it an issue
 bavaal badha to dayashankar ne do baar maafee maang lee
 After Mayawati's protest, the BJP even removed Dayashankar from the party
 iske baad bhi bispi ne lakhanu ke hajratganj main pradarshan kiya
 During that time Daya's wife Swati and her daughter were abused
 swati ne apane boote palata raajnneetik daanvus raily ke baad to swati ne sara khel palat diya
 The BJP was on the backfoot for abusing Mayawati, but Swati reversed her stakes after being abused in return
 mayawati or nasimudadin siddki jaise netaaon par mukadmaa darj ho gaya
 Then the case was forward versus dalit
 karenge mayawati kii reliyon kaa lagaataar pichhamayawati ko jab tak ye ehsaas hota ki bispi se chook ho gai he, tab tak swati ne raajnneetik maidan maar liya tha
 Frustration intensified against abusive leaders within the party
 jaise ko taisa ke andaaj main jawaab dene vaali mayawati ko peeche hatana padaa or galicond se focus hataane ke liye unhone raily karne kaa elaan kar diya
 Swati and Dayashankar did not give up their chase and now have to compete against the preparations
 swati singh ko aage badha rahi he bijepibijepi ne bhale hi dayashankar singh ko mayawati ke khilaaf gandi baat bolne ke aarope party se nikaal diya ho, lekin swati singh ko aage karne ke pichhebijapi kaa hi dimagmana ja rahaa he
 Actually BJP knows that the vote of Dalits is not going to divert from Mayawati
 aise main agar is mudde par savarna vot ko golband kiya jaae to ye unke chunavi nuksaan kii bharpai kar saktaa he

 The discussion of the merger of the Qaumi Ekta Dal into the party has started once between the sound of assembly elections in UP and the ruckus in SP

 He said on Tuesday, 'the party's parliamentary board had decided to break away from the Qaumi Ekta Dal, but the decision can be reversed if the board wants to
 'aaj tak' se khaas baatcheet main ravidaas mehrotra ne kaha ki samaajawaadee party main loktantr he or yahaan bahumat ke aadhaar par hi faisla hota he
 He said, 'the doors of possibility are always open in politics and any decision can be reconsidered
 '
 
 
 Therefore, Akhilesh Gaur is hesitating that senior minister Shivpal Yadav is angry with the way the Samajwadi Party first joined and broke with the Qaumi Ekta Dal
 pichley 2 dinon main lagaataar unhone apni naaraazgi saarvajanik taur par jaahir kii or istife tak kii baat kar di
 But the problem is that Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav is hesitating to join hands with the Qaumi Ekta Dal
 unhen lagata he ki mukhtaar ansaari jaise logon ke saath gathbandhan se unki image kharaab hogi
 Mulayam will remove Shivpal's displeasure, however, now there are indications that Mulayam Singh Yadav has once again cleared the merger with the Qaumi Ekta Dal in order to allay Shivpal Yadav's displeasure and gain Muslim votes in eastern Uttar Pradesh

 Sitting on the Parliamentary Board soon, Vidas Mehrotra said that the opinion of the people within the party regarding the Qaumi Ekta Dal may be different, but it is wrong to say that there is pride within the party

 Even on my request, the officials are not listening, so said the resignation

 Amir Rashid, a young Muslim leader from Aligarh, sharply criticized Kamal Haasan's statement
 muslim youth association ke adhyaksh bataae jane vaale mohammad aamir rashid ne kaha he ki camel hasan raashtra virdohi hai, ve apane bayaan se hindu or muslimon main daraar paidaa karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 If someone puts soot on their face, they will give him 25 thousand rupees as a reward
 raashid ne ek dainik akhbaar se baatcheet karte hue kaha ki yadi hindu charampanthi ho gaye to koi bhi doosraa samudaay surakshit nahin rahegaa
 The Mahasabha had given an angry statement: According to the latest statement of the Mahasabha, Kamal Haasan should be shot for anti-hindu statements
 gauratlab he ki haal hi main camel ne kaha tha ki ye nahin kaha kaa saktaa ki hinduon main aatankwaad nahin he
 He had said that earlier Hindus used to talk but now they have started committing violence and hence people have lost their trust due to Satyamev Jayate because now victory is only of strength
 is baat par aapatti darj karaate hue hindu mahasabha ke upaadhyaksh ashok sharma ne kaha, "camel hasan or unke jaise baaki logon ko goli maar dena chahie yaa phir faansee par lataka dena chahie, taaki ve log kuch sabak sikh saken
 Any person who uses profanity for those who belong to Hinduism should have no right to live on this holy earth and should be given death sentence in exchange for abusive language
 "hindu kabhi aatankwaadi nahin ho sakate: sadhvi rutambharice mudde par sadhvi rutambhraa ne kaha, "hindu kabhi aatankwaadi nahin ho sakate, ve keval aatankwaadiyon kaa shikaar hote hai
 This is the reason that terrorism continued to grow because Hindus always fell prey to it
 "camel hasan ko kashmir main jaakar dekhnaa chahie: vinay katiyaarhindu aatankwaad ke bayaan par camel hasan par palatwaar karte hue bijepi netaa vinay katiyaar ne kaha ki ab wo super star nahin rah gaye hai
 All his films are beating
 lihaaja wo is tarah ke bayaan de rahe hai
 a case should be registered against them and the government there should treat them in a good hospital
 hindu aatankwaadi nahin ho saktaa he
 There are Islamic terrorism all over the world
 unke aatanki camp chalate hai
 They should go and see in Kashmir
 tab unako samaj main aayega ki islamic aatankwaad kya hota hai?court ne 'hindu aatankwaad' kii tippanee par diya exiaar kaa adeshvaranasi kii ek adaalat ne camel hasan dwaara 'hindu aatankwaad' par likhe gaye vivaadit lekh ke mudde par sunwaayee karte hue is maamle main tamil abhinayta camel hasan par exiaar darj karne kaa aadesh diya he
 Let me tell you that advocate Kamlesh Chandra Tripathi had filed a petition in the court of ACJM in Varanasi, accusing Haasan of hurting religious sentiments
 is par shanivaar ko sunwaayee karte hue justise sudhakar dube ne maamla darj karne kaa aadesh diya
 The next hearing on the petition will now be held on 22 November

 yaheen nahin intervyuu le rahe reporter ko unhone dhamkee bhi de daali ki yadi vah is recording ko delit nahin karte to vah use apane ghar se jane nahin denge
 During the interview, Joshi told the reporter to ask questions of national issues and not about Modi
 joshi ne kaha ki kanpur seat ke babat bhi unase na sawaal puche jaaen
 Joshi not only saw the video footage but also asked to delete it
 jab vahaan maujuud reporter ne aisa karne se manaa kar diya to unhone unhen dhamkaaya or kaha ki delit nahin kiya to aap ghar se baahar nahin ja paaoge
 Significantly, Joshi is currently the party's MP from Varanasi and this time also he wanted to contest from there but BJP gave his seat to Narendra Modi and sent him to Kanpur

 ye mahaj do vidhyalay nahin, balki soobe main chal rahe un farji skulon ke pratinidhi hai, jinke dam par shiksha lut kaa vyavsaay ban gai he
 There are three categories of High School and Inter Colleges accredited by the Education Department of the state: Government, Government Aided (financial Aided) and Financeless (unaided)
 vibhageeya aankadon ke mutabik rajya main 1,000 rajkeey inter college, 4,500 sahaytaprapt hyskool, inter college or 15,500 vittvihin hyskool or inter college chal rahe hai
 Apart from this, all non-accredited schools fall under the category of fake schools
 farji skulon kaa khulaasa varsh 2006 main board parikshaon main bade paimaane par sangathit nakal ke saamne aane ke baad hua
 Then the government came into action and the rules for registration of students were tightened

 On 2 September, the investigation team of the Education Department was registered at Sunni Inter College, Nakkhas, a government-aided school of Lucknow Public Montessori Inter College, Kakori

 This is where the fakewara got caught because why any student will go to coaching in rural area 25 km from Nakhas area in the middle city

 sitambar ke duusare hafte main jab ‘uttar pradesh madhyamik shikshak sanghy ne aise farjivade ke khilaaf andolan shuru kiya to lakhanu main shiksha adhikariyon ne kuch harakat dikhaai
 As soon as the investigation of recognized schools starts, the smell of rigging has started
 lakhanu ke sitapur road sthit indra public inter college kii inter kaksha main kul panjikrut 187 chaatro main se mahaj 40 hi padhate mili
 Similarly, 63 students have been registered in the inter class of Govind Narayan Inter College of Thakurganj and 25 students in high school, but not a single student was found studying in this college on the spot
 isi prakaar chaar darjan se adhik manyataprapt collejon main chaatr sankhya main gadabadi mili
 Clearly, these colleges had registered all such students who are not students of other fake colleges, but here
 shiksha adhikariyon ko yah bhi phikr nahin ki jin collejon ko unhone manyata de rakhi he, vah astitv main hai bhi ki nahin
 One such school is 'stirlin Public Inter College' in Hindnagar, Lucknow, which has been recognized by the authorities but is being run instead of a school but a wedding procession
 shiksha vibhaag ke dastavejon main rani avantibai intermediyat college, mahibullapur ko manyata mili hui he, lekin hakeekat main yah college astitv main he hi nahin
 In fact, the opening of new schools as per the requirement has also given the chance for fake schools to flourish

 Accredited schools have found a new way of earning

 The same logic is for the management system of 90 per cent of the accredited schools which are heating their pockets from the ground of the schools
 ‘uttar pradesh shaikshik sansthaaen (astiyon kaa nivaaran) adhinium, 1974’ ke mutabik vidhyalay bhoomi kaa vyavsaayik upyog nahin kiya ja saktaa

 District school inspector Umesh Tripathi of Lucknow accepts some departmental pressure due to which no action could be taken on fake schools
 shikshak sangh ke sakht ravaiye ke baad shiksha vibhaag ne sitambar ke duusare hafte se teji dikhaate hue rajdhani main 250 se adhik farji vidyalayon par exiar darj kara di he

 james anderson ne sweekaar kiya ki chhintakashi se kabhi sachin tendulkar kaa dhyaan bhang nahin ho saktaa
 But the England fast bowler believes that the furore over Tendulkar's 100th international century may affect the performance of this batsman and India in the Test series
 anderson ne 21 july se lords main shuru hone vaale pehle test match ke bare main kaha,‘sachin tendulkar ne pichley kai varshon main jis tarah se 99 antarrashtriya shatak jade usase aap yahi kah sakate ho ki lords main unke 100wein shatak ko lekar jo baaten chal rahi hai usase vah prabhavit hone vaale antim vyakti honge

 He wrote in the 'daily Mail', 'history, atmosphere and everything is there and it will always be on your mind that you are probably playing here for the last time so that you get immersed in the game and enjoy it to the fullest
 
 ’anderson ne kaha ki isi tarah se jis tarah kaa dabaav he usase tendulkar kaa dhyaan bhang ho saktaa he bhale hi vah do dashak se kyon nahin khel rahe hon
 He said, 'I know that Sachin never scored a century at Lord's but i could not believe that his highest score there was 37 runs
 mujhe nahin lagata ki apane 100wein antarrashtriya shatak kii sambhaavna se vah apni ekaagratha bhang hone denge
 "he said," But everyone is well aware of this achievement and it is also true that he has never scored a century on Lord's
 is hip se unki puri team par hi galat prabhaav pad saktaa he
 If they start thinking too much about Sachin, then we can benefit from it
 ’unhone kaha,‘aap kisi bhi sthaan par sachin ko gendbaaji kar rahe ho unhen jald se jald out karne kii koshish karte ho
 To be honest, such places are not many
 lekin is saptaah lords main hamaara lakshya bharat ke star ballebaaj ko ranon ke liye tarasaane kaa he or ummid he ki ham unase galati karwaane safal rahenge
 Anderson said, 'I would not like to be slandered against Sachin
 meraa anubhav he ki jab bhi aap unke khilaaf shabdic jang chhedate ho vah adhik patibaddh ho jate hai
 It will not be easy to ignore the noise of the spectators when Sachin comes to bat but we have to concentrate on our bowling and do not think who you are bowling

 Amidst all this, on Sunday, the alliance said that the alliance will happen only when her party gets a chance to fight in respectable seats, otherwise she will contest alone
 haalanki, unhone bijepi ko rokane ke liye gathbandhan ko bahut ahm bhi bataaya
 In such a situation, where is Mayawati pointing from respectable seats
 kya ye ladaai upi tak hi simit he yaa phir desh ke baaki rajyon main bhi kuch siton kii ummid lagaae baithi hai?basapaka aadhaar upi se baahar duusare rajyon main bhi he
 However, Mayawati has stuck a new screw for the rest of the parties by placing her condition
 lekin akhilesh yadav kisi bhi surat main basapa kaa saath nahin chhodana chaahate hai
 In India Today's Mind Rocks, Akhilesh Yadav said that i will compromise on any number of seats to prevent the BJP from coming to power
 aise main chaar formule hai jinke aadhaar par basapa ko sammanjanak siten or mahagathbandhan main siton ke bantwaare kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Formula of runnerup seats BJP alliance got 73 seats out of 80 seats in UP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 jabaki sapa ko paanch or congress ke khate main do seat gai thi, lekin basapa kaa khaataa bhi nahin khulaa tha
 In such a way, for the seat-sharing of seats for the grand alliance, the seats on which the party has been in the second place should be given in their account
 is lihaaj se basapa 34 seat, sapa 31 seat or congress sirf 6 seat par duusare sthaan par rahi thi
 If there is a seat-sharing on this formula, then the BSP will get the maximum number of seats
 kya mayawati ke liye ye sammanjanak siten hongi, jinakar raji hongi
 After the bsp's desire for seats outside UP, BSP is the only party among opposition parties whose base is in other states besides UP
 basapa baqayda vahaan vidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaav bhi ladati rahi he
 They have mlas in some states in the assembly, but only one seat of Madhya Pradesh could win in the Lok Sabha
 basapa ke dalit votbank kii takat ne maujuuda raajnneeti main mayawati ke kad ko badha diya he
 This is the reason that Mayawati is seeking seats in other states
 mayawati ko lagata he ki ve zyada se zyada siton par ladakar agar acchhee khaasi siten le aati hai to unke piem banane kaa khwab puraa ho saktaa he
 If sources are to be believed, the Congress is ready to give some seats in the assembly elections but does not agree to the Lok Sabha seats
 basapa ke ab tak ke sabase best nattijeylokasabhaa chunaav main basapa ko sabase zyada siten 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mili thim
 27 to the BSP
 20 fisadi voton ke saath 20 siten mili thi
 This was the best result in BSP politics
 jabaki sapa ko 23
 23 seats and Congress 11 with 26 percent votes
 65 fisadi vot or 21 siten jeetne main safal rahi thi
 While RLD had got five seats
 congress is formule par siten chaahati he, lekin sapa basapa is par raji nahin hai
 In 2004, the SP had the highest number of mps from the seat, winning the 2004 Lok Sabha elections
 sapa ko 26
 35 seats with 74 percent vote, 24 to BSP
 67 fisadi vot ke saath 19 siten or congress ko 12
 It won 9 seats with 04 percent votes
 sapa ko ye formula apane paksh main najar aa rahaa he, lekin basapa ise lekar taiyaar nahin he
 BSP has demanded the highest number of seats of the BSP, and has made the condition of respectable seats to be part of the grand alliance
 iske liye upi kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se basapa ko sabase zyada siten dene par sahyogi dal raji hai, lekin 36 siton se zyada par taiyaar nahin hai
 At the same time, SP is being made a formula of 32 seats, Congress 9 and RLD 3 seats
 jabaki sutron kii maane to basapa 40 siten maang rahi he, jis par baat nahin ban rahi he
 Let me tell you that after the defeat of the BJP and the victory of the opposition in the Lok Sabha by-elections in gorakhpur-phulpur and Kairana, the grand alliance is expected to be there

 celibrity dance reality sho jhalak dikhalaa ja se baahar ho chuke actor ashish choudhary se baatcheet ke pramukh ansh
 How was Jhalak's journey? i was very nervous when i started to see
 maine sho sirf karan johar ke kehane par kiya tha or main colors channel ke saath comfortable tha
 i started enjoying doing this
 yah safar bahut thakaa dene vaala tha
 Tell us about the incident that happened to you? There is no mechanical equipment in our show
 chaar-paanch log us haaranes ko khinch rahe the jis par main lataka hua tha
 Two people slipped while i was in the air
 main achaanak neeche aa gaya lekin koi chot nahin lagi
 i was having a bad time, they picked me up at the wrong time and in the end they lost all control
 mere act kaa aadha hissaa arial tha or vah puri tarah kharaab ho gaya
 My condition became monkey without support
 main or meraa koreographer kuch nahin kar sakate the kyonki sara kaam duusare logon ke haath main tha
 But they could not control
 mujhe pataa tha ki main baahar ho jaaoongaa
 But my dancing was right from the beginning till the end, it is a pleasure for me
 agar main apni pareshaaniyon kii baat karata to yah lujar vaali baat hoti
 i do not believe in complaining
 main sirf isliye baat kar rahaa hum kyonki main apane phans ko bataanaa chahta hum ki mere saath kya hua
 They should know that i was perfect but that defeat was not under my control
 aapako lagata he aapke saath sahi hua? jajon kaa faisla sahi tha?yah khel he, iske niyam nahin tode ja sakate
 i had to follow the rules
 main to bas yahi kah saktaa hum ki is tarah kii samasya nahin aani chahie thi
 The judges' hands were also bound by the rules
 formet kii vajah se mere koreographer ke chotil hone ke baavjood mujhe second chance nahin mila tha
 What did Jhalak teach you? The Fear Factor taught that you should come above your fears
 mere liye, agar khataron kaa khilaadi dar se ubarne ke liye tha to jhalak ne mujhe apane jivan ke sabase bade dar daancing se ubaara he
 It taught me to go on stage and dance openly
 ab main bina kisi dar ke stage par dance kar saktaa hum
 Tell me about the judges? Many people said that the judges had problems with me except Karan
 mujhe hameshaa laga ki ve mujhase or mehnat chaahate hai ki taaki main or mehnat karun
 i tried to look positive in everyone
 ganesh thode sakht jaj the or ve mujhe lekar hameshaa kaaphi khamiyaan nikaalte the
 i used to try to impress them
 jab sho par meraa safar khatm hua to ve mere paas aae or bole kii main acha kar rahaa tha
 i liked that they recognized my growth
 lauren beshak marks ko lekar meri prati bahut naram nahin rahi hai
 But i know that she wanted to see me doing well
 jab haaranes sambandhi samasya ai to ve gusse main un logon ke paas gai or unhen kaaphi latada
 Lauren spoke to me twice and said that she felt bad for putting me out
 unhone mujhe kya ank die isaki parvaah nahin lekin ve mujhe pasand karti thim
 Shahid also used to praise me
 karan to the hi achche
 What to say about the rest of my peers? The contestants who participated in the show were like family to me
 aisa hi khataron ke khilaadi main bhi tha
 i met him as soon as the glimpse was over
 dost bananaa hi meri jhalak kii kamai he
 Which item of Jhalak will you miss the most? i will miss my choreographer Fellan the most
 rushaali or failan ne mere liye bahut mehnat kii
 Now what will i do next? i did this show simply because i was excited about them
 meri pasand to fiction he
 Enough of reality shows
