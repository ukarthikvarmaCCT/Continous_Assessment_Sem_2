 lekin swadeshi jaagran manch ke virodh ke baad sitambar 20120 main board se barkhaast kar diya gaya
 Nachiket was considered very special by RBI Governor Urjit Patel
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) se sambhddha swadeshi jaagran manch (esageem) ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko likhe patr main aarope lagaaya tha ki nachiket bill or melinda gates foundation (bimgf) ke liye kaam karte hai or is sanstha kii videsh se funding kii jaati he
 At the same time, the Reserve Bank also acts as a regulator of foreign funds in the country
 lihaaja nachiket kaa arabiai main bane rahane kaa koi auchity nahin he
 3 - In PNB, both the Punjab National Bank came face to face on the scam, Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi scam of 20 thousand crores and escaped
 sarkaar ne kaha ki rigerv bank is ghotaale kaa pataa kyon nahin laga paaya, kyonki nigaraanee kii jimmedaari rigerv bank kii he? rigerv bank ne palatakar bol diya ki piesu bainkon kii maalik to sarkaar he
 The entire management is also with the government, why did it not look at such a big scam? Along with this, the Reserve Bank Governor also said that the regulator should be interfered with PSU banks
 4-badhate enpie par badi rarbadhate enpie par rigerv bank ne kaha ki puraani galtiyaan doharaai nahin jaani chahie
 The Reserve Bank ordered the banks that if there is a delay of one day in repaying the loan or installment on behalf of the big borrowers, then ask for the plan from them
 agar 180 din main plan nahin aata to maamla inasolvency main bhej den
 Fearful of this order, the bankers appealed to the government
 sarkaar ne arabiai se narmi baratane ko kaha lekin arabiai nahin mana
 Banks filed a petition in the court but the RBI brought the government on the backfoot saying that if the government wants to make changes, then order it under the RBI Act
 lekin sarkaar ne kadam peeche khinch liye
 5- Strict increase on banks: RBI put 11 banks under surveillance
 matlab unhen koi bhi bada lone dene se pehle regulator kii manjuuri leni hi hogi
 The government kept watching this order
 isse bank bhi pareshaan hue or sarkaar bhi
 6- Refusal to reduce interest rates The government wanted the Reserve Bank to reduce interest rates in view of the decrease in inflation, so that industrial development can be boosted
 lekin rigerv bank kii monitering cameti ne is saal teen baar byaaj daren badha deen
 The government also wanted to increase the dividend it received, but the Reserve Bank did not agree to it
 7- NBFC par vivadali&fs ke difolt ke baad nakadi kii dikkat hui, to sarkaar ne rigerv bank se niyam naram karne ko kaha
 But RBI did not listen
 haalanki baad main bainkon ko non banking finanshal company (enbiensi) main lone dene ke liye 5 percent chhot di gai, par baat bani nahin
 Will the government remove the RBI governor? Opposition parties have been targeting the government after CBI director Alok Verma and special director Asthana were sent on leave
 aise main arabiai governor ko hataane kaa kadam uthaanaa mushkil hoga
 There is also the fear that if Patel opens his face in the media after his removal, then new trouble will arise for the government
 itane bade kadam kaa asar market main bhi dikhegaa or sarkaar ko jawaab dena mushkil ho jayega
 But it is believed that he will not get a second term after 2019

 Significantly, this phase of the Lok Sabha elections is being seen as a tough test for the BJP as the BJP won 45 of these seats in the 2014 elections, while the Trinamool Congress (TMC) got eight, the Congress (congress) Two more Samajwadi Party (SP) and LJP won one seat each

 ' kya nitish kumaar ek baar phir bihar ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lenge? yaa janata dal united kaa vidhayak dal apana nayaa netaa chunegaa? iskaa faisla somvaar ko ho jayega
 Significantly, Nitish Kumar resigned from the post of Chief Minister, taking responsibility for the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, which was also accepted by Bihar Governor DY Patil
 haalanki, nitish kumaar ne vidhansabha bhang nahin karne kii sifarish kii thi
 Subsequently, the JDU Legislature Party met on Sunday
 jisamen saare vidhayak nitish kumaar ke siem bane rahane par ade rahe
 After this, Nitish Kumar has asked till date to think
 nitish kumaar somvaar ko apane istife par khud faisla le sakate hai
 The activists, stunned by Nitish's sudden resignation, came out on the road
 upar se party adhyaksh sharad yadav ke nitish ko manaane kii jagah nae mukhyamantri chunane ke bayaan ne ubaal ko badha diya
 Inbound and outgoing leaders continued to be victims of the anger of the activists
 kya hua jediu vidhayak dal kii baithak main?mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke awaas main jediu vidhayakon kaa jamghat or bechaini saaf mahasoos kii ja sakati he
 According to sources, the legislators demanded Nitish to withdraw his resignation as soon as the meeting started
 lekin nitish ade rahe or siem kii kursi par kabiz rahane se manaa kar diya
 Then the JDU mlas sat on a dharna
 vidhayakon ke jidd ke aage nitish kumaar kii ek naa chali
 After pressure from the legislators, he asked for a day to consider his resignation
 nitish par bijepi kaa hamalaudhar, bijepi kaa pratinidhimandal bhi rajyapal se mulaakaat ke liye pahunch gaya
 The claim that the JDU does not have a majority, therefore, the claim of forming the government should be rejected
 bijepi netaa bhi nitish kumaar par hamalaa karne se nahin chook rahe
 Party leader Rameshwar Chaurasia said that Nitish Kumar should stop this 'gimmick' and work for the development of Bihar
 yah bihar kii janata ke saath anyaay he
 lalu-nitish will come along? Meanwhile, Sharad Yadav spoke of joining hands with Lalu and heats up political mercury
 haalanki ye sirf bayaan hi rahaa
 Neither sent the proposal to anyone nor accepted it from anyone
 agle kuch ghante main nitish apane pattey kholenge
 It is very possible that Nitish should accept the views of mlas and resignation becomes a matter of history

 At the same time, there can be ruckus about the film's poster
 rizvi kii is film kaa philhal trailor or poster relies hoga, jabaki janvari main ye film release ho sakati he
 At the time of the release of the movie trailer on Monday, the director and other producers of the film will also be present

 Please tell that Wasim Rizvi is constantly campaigning that a Ram temple should be built at the disputed place in Ayodhya, the mosque should be shifted from there to another place
 wasim rizvi ne isi saal ke november maheene kii shuruyaat main piem modi ko ek baar phir patr likhaa tha
 Rizvi has reiterated that a Ram temple should be built on the site of Babri Masjid
 iske alaava babari masjid se babari naam hataakar lakhanu main aman kii masjid banaai jaae
 He said that instead of naming this mosque after a king or ruler, it should be named masjid-e-aman
 rizvi ne apni taraf se samjhaute kii copy piem modi ko bhi bheji he
 Rizvi prepared a draft last year to resolve the settlement of the Ayodhya dispute, which he submitted to the Supreme Court
 bataa den ki samjhaute main rizvi ne kaha he ki vivaadit jameen par bhagwaan shriram kaa mandir bane taaki hindu or musalamaanon ke bich kaa vivaad hameshaa ke liye khatm ho or desh main aman kaayam ho sake
 The Shia Waqf Board had said that under this draft the mosque should not be built in Ayodhya, but instead in Lucknow
 iske liye puraane lakhanu ke hussainabad main ghanta ghar ke saamne shiya vakf board kii jameen he, jis par masjid banaai jaae or iskaa naam iskaa naam kisi muslim raja yaa shaasha ke naam par na hokar 'masjid-e-aman' rakhi jaae
 Indian women have certainly broken all the limits of success in politics, business and the business world, and especially urban women have achieved unprecedented success in various fields of career and personal choice and strengthened their demand for freedom
 haalanki saamaajik kaaryakartaaon kaa kahana he ki in sabake baavjood ek sach yah bhi he ki sadakon par, galiyon main, karyaalayon main, apane hi gharon main yahaan tak ki garbh main bhi mahilaayein apni suraksha ko lekar dari hui hai
 a woman activist said that given the country's population of more than one billion, which is almost half of women, the ground reality is very bitter and reflects the very poor condition of women in society
 mahilaon dwaara tamaam arjeet safaltaaon ke baavjood rashtriya mahila ayog (encidblyoo) ke aakadon ke anusaar bharat main sangathit kshetra main mahilaon kii bhagidaari maatr 25

 According to women activist Sonali Khan, the status of women has changed over time but much remains to be done
 ek vaishvik maanavadhikaar sanghathan, 'brakethru' kii upaadhyaksh khan ne kaha, 'bhartiya mahilaon ne apni drudh ichhashakti ke bal par saamaajik evam peshewar str par bahut si safaltaaen arjeet kii hai
 Whatever field you take, women have reached everywhere in which education is the biggest contributor
 'khan ne kaha, 'aaj hamaare samaaj main anek mahilaayein sheersh padon par pahunch chuki hai tathaa bahut si mahilaayein khud ko sabit karne ke liye saamne aa rahi hai
 But at the same time the truth is that social evils and maladies are still prevalent today which are hindering their progress
 'lekhika kamala bhasin ke anusaar sarkaar dwaara pesh kiye gaye aam bajet main mahilaon ko centre main rakhkar uthaae gaye kadamon se samaaj main mahilaon ko tarakkee karne main madad milegi
 Bhasin said, 'the best thing is that all topics based on gender equality have been included in the mainstream today
 ab tak desh main pesh kiye ja chuke sabhi bajaton ke baad ab ling aadhaarit bajet kaa praavdhaan kar diya gaya he
 The constitution and laws are also being reformed keeping women in mind
 ' haalanki is baat se sabhi sahamat hai ki mahilaon ko aarthik drushti se swaavlambee banane ke liye tathaa samaaj main barabari kaa sammaan pradaan karne ke liye abhi kuch vishesh kadam uthaae jane kii jarurat he
 Despite all this, the sky is still full for women
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne vidhansabha chunaav se pehle madhya pradesh ikai kaa bhale hi punargathan kar diya ho, iskaa kuch khaas phayda hota nahin dikh rahaa
 Rahul Gandhi wants all the regional satraps to stand united and face the election, but this effort does not seem to work
 madhya pradesh congress cameti main gutbaji khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahi
 In the latest development, supporters of MP Congress President Kamal Nath and supporters of Jyotiraditya Scindia, Chairman of Election Campaign Committee, have clashed with the future Chief Minister
 purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh in donon dhadon ke bich khud ko fansaa mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Earlier this month, 'chief Minister Scindia' was seen trending on Twitter
 sindhiya ke tamaam prashansak aise card or post twit karte dekhe gaye jinamein kaha gaya tha ki madhya pradesh ke siem ke liye sindhiya hi ekmaatr upyukt vyakti hai
 In fact, a day earlier, Kamal Nath's supporters had trended the hashtag 'kamal Nath Next MP CM'
 kamalnath ke samarthan main twit kisi 'madhya pradesh congress yuva mitra mandal' dwaara kiya ja rahaa tha, to sindhiya ke samarthan main kisi 'shrimant sindhiya fain club' dwaara
 The tweet started on 6 July in support of Kamal Nath
 ye twit is prakaar the- 'maharaj or raja kaa he saath, mukhyamantri bane kamalnath
 "kamal Nath is a lotus cut, every youth of Madhya Pradesh is with you
" ''guna (sindhiya kii loksabhaa seat) se milegaa josh, raghogarh (digvijay kaa ilaaka) se aashirwad, chhindwaranetritv karegaa, siem banenge kamalnath
 a day after these tweets, Scindia's supporters became active to respond to the Kamal Nath faction
 unhone twit kar rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ke saath kamalnath or digvijay singh ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya
 Taking inspiration from Mahabharata in such an attack, it was said, 'digvijay be Drona, charioteer Kamal Nath, Srimanta (scindia) become Arjun, Madhya Pradesh is with you
 ek aise hi twit main waar to bijepi par tha, lekin isse apratyaksh taur par kamalnath se bhi joda ja rahaa he- bahut hui 'camel' kii maar, abaki baar sindhiya sarkaar
 Look at some of the other tweets of the other tweet - 'why are you in trouble, nobody is in collision (of Scindia)' "this is the eternal truth, the next CM is Jyotiraditya
 ''desh main chalegi vikaas kii aandhi, pradesh main sindhiya, centre memrahul gandhi''jaaenge mamaa (maujuuda siem shivaraj) or bijepi kaa ant hoga, aegi congress, siem honge shrimantaoticdity Scindia is no doubt perfectly suitable for CM candidate

 com / 0e9ub51aey — Mohan Lal Bhaya (@bhayalal) July 7, 2018 It is worth mentioning that if the Congress could not remove the ruling BJP in the elections of 2008 and 2013, the main reason was the factionalism in the state unit
 is baar bhi yadi gutbaji khatm nahin hui to satta main lautnaa congress ke liye sapana hi rah saktaa he
 On April 26, Rahul Gandhi reshuffled the state unit, making Kamal Nath the chairman of the Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee, while Jyotiraditya Scindia was made the chairman of the election campaign committee
 iske ek maheene baad 22 may ko digvijay singh ko madhya pradesh congress samanvay samiti kaa pramukh banaaya gaya
 But there does not seem to be any significant result of all these changes
 yah haal tab he, jab rajya main pichley 15 saal se satta main rahishivaraj sarkaar kekhilaaf jabardast anti inakambency he
 This is a good chance for the Congress to come back to power after 15 years
 lekin aise hi gutbaji jari rahi to party ke saamne se satta chali jaaegi
 Amid the ongoing tussle over formation of a government in Maharashtra, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) President Sharad Pawar has said that if the Assembly votes to prove its majority, his party will walk out of the House
 agar ensipi sadan se walkout nahin karti he, to rajya main sthir sarkaar ban paanaa sambhav nahin hoga
 In a conversation with the English newspaper 'economic Times', Pawar said these things
 unhone kaha ki vah rajya main ek sthir sarkaar chaahate hai, isliye unki party ne bijepi ko baahar se samarthan dene kaa prastaav kiya tha
 Sharad Pawar has also attacked the charge of Prithviraj Chavan, in which Chavan said that the NCP announced its support to the BJP to protect its leaders from the heat of scams
 pavaar ne kaha ki agar ensipi ke netaa ghotaale kar rahe the, to teen saal tak chavaan kya kar rahe the
 Swami Om has been evicted from 'bigg Boss 10' house last week but is constantly in the news with his statements
 mangalvaar ko ek press conference main swami ne daawa kiya ki big bos ke nae saal ke special episod main jab salmaan khan ghar ke andar aae the tab unhone salmaan ko thappad maaraa tha

 piem modi ne kaha ki notebandi se garibon, eemaandaaron or madhyam varg ko phayda hoga
 Read the highlights of PM Modi's speech on demonetisation
 1
 Demonetisation has dealt a major blow to the entire business of counterfeit notes
 maine koi nirnay kisi ko pareshaan karne ke liye nahin kiya, desh kii bhavi peedi ko khadaa karne ke liye kiya he
 These 50 days will hurt you
 beyimaanon ke khilaaf ladaai jeetenge
 2
 skool main daakhile ke liye bhi cash main paisa dena padataa he, ye jo kadam uthaaya he usase garib, madhyam varg kii laachaari khatm hone vaali he
 3
 aaj main aapse aagrah karne aayaa hum, ye jo badmaashi karne vaale log hai wo jandhan acount kholane waalon ko paas pahunch kar unhen pralobhan de rahe hai
 Do not let such sinners enter
 kanoon itnaa sakht he ki paisa dene vaale mukar jaaenge or garib jiske acount main paise jamaa honge wo funs jayega
 Stay as far as you can from anyone's money, whether it is 500 or thousand
 wo aapako fansaa kar bhaag jayega
 This is my plan to save the poor, middle classes and farmers
 4
 Cash is demanded when a person from middle class goes to buy a house
 uske khun paseene kii kamai ko kaale main maanga jaataa he
 i have given such punishment to ruin the lives of some people
 5
 The middle class earns hard work
 unhen luutane waalon se raahat milegi
 The poor need pure drinking water, children's education, medicines for the sick, and the poor need their right
 paise jamaa honge
 It has been only ten days but more than 5 lakh crore has been deposited in banks
 aage bhi paise aaenge
 What will the bank do with these money? unhen ab lone deni padegi
 Clothes, utensils, barbers, all will get loan
 garib, madhyam varg ko kam bjaay dar par lone milenge
 6
 maine aaj pradhanmantri awaas yojana gramin shuru kiya
 When our country celebrates 75 years of independence in 2022, then the poorest of the poor of India should have their own house
 har garib ke paas kam se kam 267 varg feet kaa apana ghar hoga
 i have pledged to build a poor house
 sachche arth main ghar banane kaa kaam puure desh main prarambh kiya gaya, karodon karodon ghar banane hai
 Under this scheme, a member of that poor's family will be trained to become a mason and then build their own house
 sabase badi baat ye he ki inhen aisa karne ke liye manaregaa ke tahat paise bhi milenge

 pehle uria ke liye desh ke kisaan qatari main khadey rahete the
 When urea was not given and there was a ruckus, the police would come and beat the farmers and the farmers were bled
 kalabazari sarkari uria ko lut lete the
 The truck used to go to the black marketers and the farmers yearned for urea
 maine uria neem coted karvaa diya
 Now urea does not work for any chemical, only in the fields
 uria kii kalabazari band ho gai
 If the land and crop were benefited, farmers also benefited

 i bow my head to the poor, middle class, educated and honest people of the country

 kya aapke ilaake main mausam se tabah fasalon ke moolyankan ke liye zamin kii naapi hui he
 If you come from a farmer family or are in contact with a farmer, then call the farmers of North or Central India
 tabhi aapako pataa chalegaa ki alag-alag rajyon yaa centre ke str par hazaar yaa lakh hectare zamin main fasalon kii barbaadi kaa jo aankada diya ja rahaa he wo sahi he yaa nahin
 Farmers are telling that due to bad weather for twenty days, wheat, mustard earrings have fallen, but Tehsildar or Patwari has not come to assess the loss
 jab yahi buniyadi kaam nahin hua he to dilli yaa tamaam rajdhaniyon main muaavze ke liye samvedansheeltaa dikhaane kaa daawa kitna khokhla ho saktaa he
 i cannot claim that i have met all the farmers of the country, but today i have met ten farmers of Greater Noida
 unke saath kheton main barbaad gehun kii fasalon kaa haal lete vakt pehali baat yahi pataa chali ki koi bhi adhikari unke ilaake kii taraf nahin aayaa he
 Farmers told that this happens every time
 tehseeldaar yaa patawaari bina daura kiye register par bhar dete hai ki kitna ilaaka prabhavit hua or nuksaan kaa pratishat kya he
 While doing so, care is taken to minimize the loss of crops
 aap jaanate hai ki muawza dene kii tay prakriya he
 This is the case in all states with slight differences
 beemaa yaa fasalon kii barbaadi kaa muaavja tabhi miltaa he jab ek block ke 70 pratishat bhoomi par nuksaan hua ho
 One farmer said that fifty percent loss in every field is necessary only then the amount of compensation will be fixed
 patawaari maanata hi nahin he ki sattar pratishat kheton main nuksaan hua he
 Even if he agrees, the loss of each farm is less than 50 percent, which reduces the claim on compensation
 muawza mil bhi gaya to 20 yaa pachaas rupee se zyada nahin miltaa he
 Devendra Sharma has rightly said in the article that the same scandal happens with the insurance of crops
 unhone samajhaayaa he ki ek ghar main aag lage or beemaa company yah kahe ki ham beemaa raashi tabhi denge jab mohalle ke sattar or gharon main aag lagi ho
 Which sensible middle class would accept this condition of insurance companies
 kisaan ne kaha he ki block ko unit kyon mana jaataa he
 The insurance of crops should be fixed considering the farmer as a unit
 privet companiyaan to beemaa policy hi nahin detii hai
 Co-operative societies take a premium ranging from 100 to three hundred rupees while purchasing fertilizer from us, but the insurance amount is received only when 70 percent of the area has been damaged
 yani duusare ke ghar main aag lagegi tabhi aapako aapke ghar kaa beemaa milegaa
 One farmer explained the waste differently
 kaha ki jo ole padate hai wo aath sau meter se lekar ek kimi kii chaudaai main padate hai
 Crops outside its scope are not wasted
 isliye ek block main sattar pratisht kheti kii zamin main nuksaan kii shart kam hi puri hoti he
 Our crop is ruined due to rain and strong wind
 jo fasalein khadi rah gayi hai unke bhi dane jhad gaye hai
 They are left standing because they are less dense
 yani gap itnaa he ki hawa nikal gai hogi
 Crops are dense in fields where fertilizer is high
 ek duusare se itani nazadik hai ki hawa ke saamne diwaar ban jaati he or saamana na kar paane par gir jaati hai
 We were talking with these farmers on the day when mps of all parties were taking vows with their pleas for the interests of farmers in the Rajya Sabha by taking the Lok Sabha
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki agar inhen kisi kii chintaa hoti he to sirf kisaanon kii hoti he
 One farmer said that the insurance premium in the US is paid by the government
 centre yaa rajya sarkaar ko bhi yahi karnaa chahie
 The farmers now know what happens in America but they do not know what is happening to them in India
 muaavze kii raashi kaa bhi ek khel he
 The compensation that the governments have fixed according to the acreage is around three and a half thousand
 jabaki ek acre zamin main gehun bone par aath se das hazaar kii laagat aati he
 Potato costs about fifteen thousand
 fasal acchhee ho kamai tees se pachaas hazaar ke bich hone kii ummid rahati he
 That is, the amount of relief or insurance should be reduced so that the cost does not come out
 punjab sarkaar ne maang kii he ki prati acre muawza kam se kam das hazaar mili
 Certainly the government will not do this
 sari raajnneeti maang karne ke sangharsh ke dikhaave main hi puri kar lee jaaegi
 The farmer is devastated
 mausam kii maar se koi sarkaar nahin bachaa sakati lekin nitiyaan to aisi bana hi sakati he ki wo barbaad na ho
 Not only this, the cost of removing the wasted crops from the field is also going to be included
 iskaa hisaab to koi nahin jodta
 Where do you find a place for farmers' issues between Delhi issues? laut kar aayaa to dekha ki twitor par manmohan singh or aam aadmi party ke audio sting par maar machi hui he
 In foul language, everyone was challenging that we should discuss and show it tonight
 ab ham dekhenge aapaki bahaduree
 For one time, i was also moved to leave the issue of farmers
 sting yaa manmohan singh par charchaa karte hai
 Nobody challenges us for public issues
 kuch log zarur sakht sawaal karte hai magar raajnneetik muddon ke liye gaali galouj kii bhashaa main chunauti dena sirf yahi bataata he ki aaj kii raat unhen apni raajnneetik bhadaas mitaani he or tivi ko bhi yahi karnaa chahie
 Actually this is what TV is doing
 isamen unki bhi kya galati he
 Since Monday, i have been trying to discuss or report on waste of crops
 har din lutian dilli main ghoomane vaali khabaren dimag par chaa ja rahi thim
 Today many people will be disappointed but think how much relief the farmers will be given that someone showed their issue
 rahi baat asli raahat kii to wo unhen kahaan milane vaali he
 When the survey of their land has not been done for so many days, then leave the matter of relief
 manmohan singh kaa aaropee bananaa or aam aadmi party kaa audio sting kam mahatvapurn nahin he

 And at the same time, the trees started raining flowers
 darasal maine hi ye plan kiya hua tha ki us ped ke neeche pahunch kar main niti ko prapos kar duungaa
 "nihar also proposed the policy by sitting on one knee on Kapil's show
 gauratlab he ki nihaar pandya or niti mohan pichley 4 saal se relationships main hai lekin apane rishte ko lekar unhone hameshaa chuppi saadhe rakhi
 Niti has sung many famous songs in Bollywood
 vahi unki bahan shakti mohan bhi femes koreographer hai
 Deepika dated Nihar early in her career, though both of them had a breakup after some time
 duniya kii sabase taqatvar mahilaon main se ek milinda gates ne bharat main mahilaon kii sthiti, unke saath hone vaale rape or duusare jaghanya maamalon kii kadi ninda karte hue apni pratikriya di he
 He said that his organization Bill and Milinda Gates had conducted some surveys, the results of which showed that domestic violence cases in India were much higher than the government figures
 ek akhbaar main chhapi khabar ke mutabik, bharat main mahilaon or bacchon ke saath hone vaali rape kii ghatnaon par apni pratikriya dete hue milinda ne kaha ki is maamle main bharat kii tasviir vaaki kaaphi daraavnee or chintaa main daalane vaali he
 Milinda said that women need to be empowered
 acchhee baat yah he ki bharat main is ore kadam badaye ja rahe hai
 She also referred to the media and said that the media has also been working to improve the condition of women
 antarrashtriya str par bhi mahilasshaktikaran ek pramukh mudda ban chukaa he
 As long as the matter will not be discussed openly and the lights will not be changed, the change will not be possible
 milinda ne kaha ki bharat ko abhi se real time data jutanaa shuru kar dena chahie
 This will make it easier to work in the right direction and it will also give effective results
 aapako bataa den ki forbs patrika ne milinda ko duniya kii teesri sabase taqatvar mahila ghoshit kiya he
 Irrespective of the possibility of the upa's poor performance in the exit poll, the Congress is still exploring the possibility of keeping the NDA away from power and forming the next government with the help of secular parties
 congress ke ek varisht netaa ne naam na bataane kii shart par kaha, ham ummid karte hai ki endie ko 200 se kam siten milengi or samaan vichaardhaara vaali partiyon ke paas ek gathbandhan (sarkaar) banane kaa mauka hoga
 But the leader refused to guess how many seats the Congress and its UPA coalition would get
 party ke bheetar aam ummid yah he ki use 120 se 140 siten milengi
 The party had won 206 seats in the last election
 party agali sarkaar ke gathan yaa teesraa morcha gathbandhan ko samarthan dene ke mudde par banty hui he
 a section of the party is opposing any such move
 uskaa kahana he ki is tarah ke kadam se congress kamjor hogi
 However, another section including p Chidambaram is arguing that government formation with some allies under the leadership of Congress is a 'very good possibility'
 narendra modi ko satta main aane se rokane ke liye 'vrahat' upie-3 ko lekar samuhik swar badhata ja rahaa he
 The idea of 'large' UPA-3 is meant to bring new allies together and keep the leadership issue open to prevent Modi from becoming Prime Minister
 ek anya varisht netaa ne kaha, saare vikalp hai or kisi bhi vikalp ko band nahin kiya gaya he
 It will all depend on how many seats we get and how many seats BJP gets and the difference between us
 jammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne is baat par jor diya he ki pradesh ke saamne aa raheen samasyaon kaa raajnneetik samaadhaan vyaavhaarikta par aadhaarit hona chahie
 At the Chief Ministers' Conference on Internal Security, Omar said, "if there is a final solution to the problem of terrorism in the state, political deliberations cannot be avoided
 unhone kaha, main ek baar phir is baat par jor duungaa ki jammu-kashmir kii samasyaon kaa raajnneetik samaadhaan vyaavhaarikta ko drushti main rakh kar kaam karte hue hi nikaala ja saktaa he
 Omar said that the root cause of most internal security problems is in politics
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki pradesh main jahaan, aatankwaadi ghatnaon kii kami ke kaaran suraksha sthitiyon main sudhaar hua he, vahiin sadakon par hinsa kii ghatnaayen badi hai
 Omar praised the close cooperation between the armed forces, central paramilitary forces and the state police for improving the security conditions of the state
 haalanki unhone chetavanee dete hue kaha ki simaaon par lagaataar nigaraanee or ghuspaith ke prayaason ko asafal karne kii jarurat he
 Regarding last year's unrest in the valley, he said, whatever be the reasons for this unrest, whatever happened, they were very painful

 Justice Rohington Nariman has disassociated himself from the hearing on the plea of uttar Pradesh teachers in the Supreme Court as they have pleaded in the case
 maamle kii sunwaayee ab 24 agast ko hogi
 The Supreme Court made it clear that no interim relief will be granted to anyone now and the case will have a final debate
 pichhali sunwaayee main court ne aadesh diya tha ki maamle kii agali sunwaayee ke din ek bhi shikshamitra court main nahin aana chahie
 If even one Shikshamitra enters the court, the case will not be heard
 court ne yah chetavanee sunwaayee ke din shikshamitron kii court main hone vaali bheed ko dekhte hue di thi
 The bench had said that 300 men enter the court room, while there is a standing room of 15-20 people in it
 aise main sunwaayee bahut mushkil ho jaati he
 Some people stand there making such faces
 kuch rone kii sthiti main hote hai
 In such a situation, we cannot hear
 court ne isse purv bhi kaha tha ki sunwaayee ke dauraan log aansu bahaane lagate hai or ummid karte hai ki unke paksh main faisle hon
 It is worth noting that during the hearing, there is a fair atmosphere in the Supreme Court premises
 jo shikshamitra court main nahin ghus pate ve coridor ko ghere rahete hai or jinhen court room kaa paas nahin mil paata ve supreme court ke bahari lon main tivi channelon ke camaron ke paas pasre rahete hai
 The comments supreme court pichley varsh se is maamle ko sun rahaa he
 Last year, on the order of the court, 1,37,000 Shikshamitras have been adjusted and taken the post of Primary Teacher in Uttar Pradesh
 shikshamitron ke liye pesh vakil minesh dube kii daleel he ki jo chaatr TET paas hai, unhen naukari se nahin hataaya ja saktaa
 The Supreme Court said that writing letters in this case will not help
 hamen is maamle main hindi or angreji main bahut chitthiyaan aa rahi hai, lekin hamane in chitthiyon ke liye WPB yani west paper basket kaa intjaam kiya he
 In the previous hearing, the court ordered that not a single Shikshamitra should come to the court on the next hearing of the case
 yadi ek bhi shikshamitra court main ghusaa to maamle kii sunwaayee nahin kii jaaegi
 The court had given this warning in view of the crowd of teachers in the court on the day of hearing
 peeth ne kaha tha ki 300 aadmi court kaksh main aa jate hai, jabaki usamen 15-20 logon ke khadey hone kii jagah he
 In this case, hearing becomes very difficult
 vahiin kuch log aise chehre banaakar khadey ho jate hai
 Some are in a state of crying
 aise main ham sunwaayee nahin kar sakate
 The court had earlier also said that during the hearing, people start shedding tears and expect a verdict in their favor
 gauratlab he ki sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court parisar main meley kaa maahaul rahata he
 Those who cannot enter the court of Shikamitra surround the corridor and those who cannot get near the court room are sitting near the cameras of TV channels on the outer lawn of the Supreme Court
 tippaniyan The Supreme Court has been hearing the case since last year
 court ke aadesh par gat varsh 1,37,000 shikshamitron ko samyojit kar uttarapradesh main praathmik shikshak ke pad par liya gaya he

 supreme court ne kaha ki is maamle main chitthiyaan likhane se baat nahin banegi
 We are getting a lot of letters in this matter in Hindi and English, but we have arranged a WPB i

 madhya pradesh ke vyaapman ghotaale kii jaanch to sibiai ne shuru kar di he lekin is maamle ne desh kii sabase badi agency kii bhi neend uda di he
 For this reason, now the Supreme Court will hear on Monday to allay the concerns of the CBI
 darasal guuruuvaar ko hi sibiai ne supreme court kaa rukh kiya tha
 The CBI told the bench of the Chief Justice that as per the order of July 9, from July 13, the CBI started investigating the Vyapam scam
 is maamle main kuch FIR to darj kar lee hai lekin is bade maamle main kul 185 FIR darj hai or saare maamalon kii jaanch ke liye sibiai ko 4 se 6 hafte kaa vakt lagegaa
 But here a legal bottleneck has come
 sibiai kii or se ASG maninder singh ne kaha ki kai maamalon main chargeshit daakhil karne kaa vakt aa gaya he
 If the CBI is not able to take up the case till that time and the Madhya Pradesh SIT also does not file the chargesheet in the court then the accused can get relief even they will be entitled to bail by law
 aise main SIT ko kaha jaae ki jab tak sibiai jin keson ko nahin leti, un keson main kanoonee karwai jari rakhe
 The comments haalanki court ne kaha ki sibiai ko is maamle main SIT se baat kerani chahie lekin sibiai ne kaha ki SIT kaa kahana he ki ab agar vyaapman maamle main wo koi karrwai karti he to ye supreme court ke adeshon kaa ulanghan hoga kyonki court ne saare maamalon ko sibiai ko saunp diya he
 Now the Supreme Court should find a solution to this matter and issue an order so that the accused of Vyapam scam do not get any relief
 chif justise ne kaha ki is maamle kii sunwaayee somvaar 20 july ko karenge
 During this time, the CBI should also give its application to the state government so that on Monday, they too can give their reply
 sibiai ne chif justise kii bench ko bataaya ki 9 july ke aadesh ke mutabik 13 july se sibiai ne vyaapman ghotaale kii jaanch shuru kar di
 Some firs have been registered in this case but there are 185 firs registered in this big case and CBI will take 4 to 6 weeks to investigate all the cases
 lekin yahaan ek kanoonee aadchan aa gai he
 ASG Maninder Singh from CBI said that the time has come to file a charge sheet in many cases
 agar sibiai us vakt tak cese nahin le pai or madhya pradesh SIT ne bhi court main chargeshit daakhil nahin kii to aropiyon ko raahat mil sakati he yahaan tak ki wo kanuunan jamaanat ke hakdaar bhi ho jaaenge
 In such a situation, the SIT should be told that till CBI does not take the legal action in those cases
 tippaniyan Although the court said that the CBI should talk to the SIT in this matter, but the CBI said that the SIT said that now if it takes any action in the case of Vyapam, then it will be in violation of the orders of the Supreme Court because the court has given all the cases Has been handed over to CBI
 ab supreme court hi is maamle kaa hal nikaale or koi aadesh jari kare taaki vyapam ghotaale ke aropiyon ko koi raahat naa mili
 The Chief Justice said that the matter will be heard on Monday 20 July
 is dauraan sibiai apni arji rajya sarkaar ko bhi de de taaki somvaar ko wo bhi apana jawaab de sake

 By the way, all the contestants of this time are quite good and are in discussion every day for some reason, but Siddharth Shukla's style is slightly different
 big bos house main koi bhi vivaad ho aursiddharth shuklaka naam saamne naa aae ye to ho hi nahin saktaa
 Once again, Siddharth Shukla has come on target, but not of any contestant but of actress Simran Kaur Mundi who has shared some pictures of Siddharth and Shehnaaz on social media

 america raashtrapati chunaav main republican party ke sambhavit ummidavaar donald trump ne tamaam chunavi sabhaaon main gaiyr-america muslimon kii america main entry par bain lagane kii baat kahi thi
 He said that the entry of Muslims in America should be completely stopped
 lekin pehali baar america raashtrapati pad kii daud main shaamil republican ummidavaar is mudde par sawaalon se khud ko kinaaraa karte hue dikhaai die
 Donald Trump's U-turn: Now, as Trump's spokesperson says, he is now a potential Republican candidate and is no longer in favor of a long-term ban on non-american Muslims entering the US
 pichhalon dinon chunavi campan ke dauraan trump ne badhate aatankwaad ko lekar america main gaiyr-america muslimon ke liye bain ko bayaan diya tha
 But now he is refraining from commenting on this statement
 trump se kai sawaal kiye gaye thegoratlab he ki pichley saal disambar main california ke san barnardino main ek hamale ke dauraan 14 logon kii goli markar hatya kar di gai thi
 After which, in the Trump, Muslims had said about the entry ban in Koharica
 trump ke is bayaan kaa us samay joardaar virodh bhi hua tha
 Not only this, Trump was asked whether this rule would also apply to the exit of US citizens? Will the same happen on the member of armed forces? King Abdullah-2 of Jordan is a staunch American ally
 to kya inke saath bhi yahi niyam lagu hoga kyonki ye bhi muslim hai? is alaava shanti ke nobel vijeta malala yusufajai ke saath koun-sa niyam paalan kiya jayega?ab pabandi main chhot dene kii batsawalon kaa jawaab main trump ke campan manager kori levendoski ne kaha tha ki bain sabhi par lagu hoga
 Not only this, it will also apply to tourists who want tourist and migrant visas
 gaiyr-muslemonse jude anya duusare sawaalon trump ke campanron se jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya
 But now Donald Trump's tough attitude towards Muslims is starting to loosen
 ab inke campanron kii ore jaankaree di ja rahi he ki pabandi ke daayre se athleton or duniya ke bade netaaon ko baahar rakhaa jayega, yani unpar pabandi lagu nahin hogi

 us samay 'rashtriya vichaaron vaale bhartiya patrakaron' ko lekar company ke rup main isaki sthapana hui or 1956 main ise kooparative kii shakl de di gai
 It is the only multilingual news agency in the country that provides news in more than a dozen languages like Bangla, Oriya, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Gurmukhi, Marathi besides Hindi and English
 agency kaa daawa he ki 1962 main china ke bharat par akraman kii pehali khabar isi agency ne di thi
 Its condition actually worsened during the Emergency, after which Hindusthan News could never stand up to its full potential
 centre main jab atal bihari vaajapeyi kii aguai main endie sarkaar bani, siyaasi vajahon se tab bhi sarkaar isko nai jindagi nahin de pai
 But the agency claims that 450-500 journalists are still associated with this agency
 lekin ab bijepi kii purna bahumat vaali narendra modi sarkaar ne nai vigyaapan niti ko lagu kar diya he, jisase hindostaan samachar kaa kayakalp hota dikh rahaa he
 In the new advertising policy, the government has created a scale of 100 digits for advertisements
 pehle vigyapanon ke liye is tarah kaa koi maapdand nahin tha
 According to the new policy, 25 marks on RNI / ABC certificate, 20 marks on cutting PF of employees, 15 marks on subscription of PTI / UNI / Hindusthan Samachar, 15 marks on owning printing press, 10 on payment of Press Council fees
 12 to 20 digits by number and pages
 ab ankon ke mutabik hi vigyapanon kaa anupaat or keemten milengi
 The most beneficial thing for the agency in the new policy is that newspapers will now have to subscribe to the agency separately for each edition
 is niti kii vajah se hindostaan samachar ko phayda ho saktaa he kyonki yah agency bahubhashiya he or masik daren bhi kaaphi kam hai
 Competition in agencies is bound to be due to this policy
 hindostaan samachar ke siio or editor in chif rakesh manjul kehete hai, ''ham print media kii ek badi bhartiya ity company ke saath qaraar karne ja rahe hai jo hamen sahaayta degi
 We want to give big support to small newspapers in the unorganized sector
 bahut jald kai bade brands hamaare saath judye vaale hai
 There may be some questions on this new policy, but PTI CEO M

 "we are a news agency," says Razdan
 kisi niti se kisi news agency ko badhaava mil rahaa he to hamen kyon aitraaj hoga?''dur kii soch rahaa sanghasarkaar ke str par nitigat badlaav or duusari ore hindostaan samachar agency puraane swayamsevak ko saunpane ke peeche kii kuch vajahen bhi hai
 Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat had said in Ninaura Vichar Mahakumbh, "let us create an environment to bring change in society
" aaj vaataavaran bana he, lekin hamen us disha main kaam karne kii jarurat he
 "the Sangh wants to build a dedicated business establishment on ideological establishment
" masalan, media main kashmir ko mudda yaa vivaad kaha jaataa he, lekin sangh kii soch he ki vivaad to usee din khatm ho gaya jab sansad ne prastaav paarit kar diya
 So now Kashmir may have a problem, not an issue or dispute
 isi tarah dharmanirpekshata jaisaa koi shabd sangh nahin maanata
 He sees it as secularism
 dharm ke aadhaar par dhruvikaran jaise shabd ko bhi sangh sahi nahin maanata
 a glimpse of this will be clearly seen in Hindusthan Samachar
 sangh ne is bahubhashiya samvaad samiti kaa kayakalp karne kii ranneeti ko isliye bhi aage badhaayaa he taaki vaicharik drushtikon se judi koi bhi khabar dabane na paae
 The Sangh wants a news system in line with its nationalist ideology because even today the media has its own credibility which at first sight plays an important role in making or disturbing the perception of someone
 isliye jab sangh ne is samvaad samiti ko peshewar banane kii yojana par kaam kiya to uske jehan main tha ki isaki jimmedaari aise shaks ko saunpi jaae jo vichaardhaara se digne vaala na ho
 According to sources, the top leadership of the Sangh decided that the person who worked in Hindusthan Samachar should be given the responsibility of the corporate later, first his background views fit the family parameters
 iske liye sangh ne chaar logon kii bhaavana bhi samajni chaahi
 According to sources, when this information r
 ke
 When given to Sinha, he replied, "the institute in which i paid 25
 par kaam kiya, agar uski jimmedaari sanbhaalane kaa mauka miltaa he to meraa saubhaahgya hoga
 In the end, Sinha, the founder chairman of SIS International and BJP MP, was given the responsibility
 berogari ke daur main jepi ke bataae anusaar saamaajik upkram ke taur par sthapit company esaies ko unhone sakriy raajnneeti main aane ke baad pichley 15 saal se puri tarah se profeshnals ke haathon main saunp diya
 Its permanent workforce is 1,10,000 and the company has a turnover of Rs 3,982 crore
 tak pahunch chukaa he
 Now they are working in uniting the society by joining politics and social service, like getting dowry marriages
 isliye sangh ne unhen is santhaan ko puri tarah se peshewar andaaj main chalaane kii chhot dete hue salaah di ki asaamaajik tatwon, rashtravirohi, deshadrohi or aatankiyon ko badhaava dene vaali khabaron ko is agency ke madhyam se pramukhataa na den
 Through this, people associated with creative and creative work should be encouraged, irrespective of their ideology
 sangh ke akhil bhartiya prachaar pramukh manmohan vaidya baat ko thodaa or spasht karne kii koshish karte hai, ''sangh kabhi sidhi dekharekh nahin karata, bas maargdarshan detaa he
 The specialty of Hindusthan News is that it is the only All India News Agency available in many Indian languages
 baaki agenciyaan sirf hindi-angreji main hi sevaayen detii hai
 We want that other important news related to national concerns which the media used to ignore, should come out now
 santhaan ko peshewar andaaj main chalaae jaae, isliye ise korporate ko diya gaya he
 "changing image" This agency is now trying to break the image of being tied to the pegs of a particular ideology by adopting professionalism
 bhartee kii paardarshee prakriya ke alaava nideshak mandal ke 21 sadasyon main achyutanand mishra, rambahadur raay, jagadish upasne or bi

 In addition, it has been decided to invite all ideas and people of the region to editorial events like Guests of the Week
 rajnatik khabaron ko 50 fisadi tak simit rakh baaki samaaj ke anya kshetra kii khabaron ko dene kii niti banaai gai he
 The institute has also implemented Majithia Wage Board

 Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said on Saturday that the central government wants a permanent solution to the Kashmir issue by gaining the trust of the people
 rajnath ne kaha ki sarkaar is disha main aage bad rahi he
 Rajnath Singh said that infiltration from Pakistan has come down by 45% since the surgical strike
 rajnath ne bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke netritv main rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) sarkaar ke teen varsh puure hone par samvaadadaataaon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, "ham kashmir mudde kaa sthai samaadhaan chaahate hai or ham kashmir ke logon kaa vishwaas hasil kar iskaa samaadhaan nikaalenge

 Rajnath said, "this problem has been there since 1947
 ise chutkiyon main nahin suljhaayaa ja saktaa
 It will take time but we will find a permanent solution and we are moving in this direction
 " Rajnath said that his government wants a solution through dialogue
 unhone kaha,"sabhi samasyaon ko baatcheet se suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Whoever wants to talk to us, we are fully prepared for this
 " Addressing reporters on the completion of three years of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Rajnath said, "we want a permanent solution to the Kashmir issue and we gain the trust of the people of Kashmir
 Will solve "tippaniyan Rajnath said that the problem of Kashmir has been there since 1947 and it cannot be solved in a few months
 rajnath ne kaha, "yah samasya 1947 se hi he
 It cannot be solved in a pinch
 isamen samay lagegaa lekin ham iskaa sthai samaadhaan nikaalenge or ham is disha main aage bad rahe hai
 " rajnath ne kaha ki unki sarkaar baatcheet ke jariye samaadhaan chaahati he
 He said, "all problems can be solved through dialogue
 jo bhi hamase baat karnaa chahta he, ham iske liye puri tarah se taiyaar hai

 " Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday inaugurated the country's largest rail-road bridge over the Brahmaputra River in Assam's Dibrugarh district
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad se hi piem modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah purvottar main khaasi dilchaspee lete najar aa rahe hai
 The result of this is that no state in the Northeast has a Congress government today
 jabaki bijepi yahaan ke kai rajyon kii satta par kabiz ho chuki he
 Now modi-shah is eyeing the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP is working on a lotus feeding strategy in 25 parliamentary seats here to compensate for losses from other states
 bataa den ki haal hi main hui paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ke baad bijepi ko 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 2014 jaise nattejey doharaana mushkil najar aa rahaa he
 Not only this, if there is an alliance between the SP-BSP in Uttar Pradesh, then in such a situation, the BJP may have lost about 20 to 25 Lok Sabha seats
 purvottar kaa samikarnadesh ke anya hisson khaskar hindi bhashi rajyon main bijepi ko jis nuksaan kii ashanka ho sakati he, uski bharpai party purvottar ke 8 rajyon kii loksabhaa siton se karnaa chaahati he
 There are a total of 25 Lok Sabha seats in the northeastern states, at present BJP has 8 seats
 vahiin, congress ke paas bhi 8 siten he or baaki siten kshetreey dalon ke kabje main he
 Now in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP has set a target of winning 21 seats in the Northeast
 darasal, bijepi purvottar main apni siyaasi takat se waakif thi
 At the grassroots in the Northeast, neither its cadres nor cadres
 aise main chote dalon ke saath or congress ke vidhayakon ko bijepi ne apane main milakar hi vah purvottar main paanv jamaane kii ranneeti apanaai
 Through Assam, the BJP opened the door to victory in the Northeast
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main assam kii 14 sansadeey siton main se bijepi ko 7 siten mili
 While Congress won 3, Badruddin Ajmal's party AIDUF won 3 and Independents one seat
 chote dalon kii ahm bhoomikiske baad may 2016 main hemanth bishwa sharma kii aguwai main nida (north east democratic elanis) kaa gathan kiya gaya
 Several important non-congress parties from the Northeast were included in the coalition in Neda
 isamen sikkim democratic front, assam gana parishad, naga piples front, sangama kii neshnal pipuls party pramukh hai
 The BJP defeated the long-held Congress in Assam with its strategy
 iske baad bijepi purvottar main kai rajyon kii satta par kabiz hoti gai
 With the alliance of these smaller parties in the northeast, BJP is running its government in Sikkim, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur, Meghalaya
 jabaki tripura main apane dam par left ke majboot laal kile ko dhwast kar satta par kabiz hui
 At the same time, for the first time the bjp's account has been opened in the recent Mizoram assembly elections
 2014 se zyada he bijepi kii lahar!piem modi ne mangalvaar ko bharat ke sabase bade pul kaa udghaatan kiya
 This 4 connecting Assam and Arunachal Pradesh
 94 kilometre lambey pul ko kai lihaaj se ahm mana ja rahaa he
 Political experts consider it very important from the political point of view
 darasal, purvottar ke logon se baat karne par pataa chalata he ki modi lahar vahaan abhi 2014 se bhi adhik majboot he
 It is clear from the talks of the people there that they have high hopes from Narendra Modi
 is baat ko bijepi bhi bakhubi samajhati he
 This is the reason why the Narendra Modi government is eyeing the Northeast
 haalanki purvottar main rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (NDA) ke sahyogi dal sikkim demacretic front ke saansad pi
 D
 raay ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa karishma ab dhundhala padataa ja rahaa he or vipakshi dalon kaa mahagathbandhan agar aakaar le letaa he to bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke liye 2019 main satta vaapasi karnaa kaaphi mushkil hoga
 Relationships of the world of politics are also pleasing and dukhti
 uski kashish ko samajhnaa mushkil he
 The division of the side and the opposition is so deep that often people on this side find their mark in the leader of that side
 lagata he ki vahaan bhi koi unke jaisaa ho
 You feel this deficiency even more when political opposition reaches the stage of hostility
 sushamaa swaraj ko aaj us taraf ke log bhi miss kar rahe hai
 In the reactions to her demise, it has often emerged that she was an old school leader
 nae skool ke saath chalati hui sushamaa swaraj puraane skool vaali netaa kyon kisi ko lag rahi thim
 She has left very deep questions behind her
 aakhir sushamaa swaraj ke raajnneetik jivan main aisi kya baat thi ki unka janaa sabko akhar rahaa he
 The age of 67 is nothing
 vaktaaon se bhari bijepi main sushamaa swaraj jaisi vaktaa kab shrota banakar rah gayi, kisi ko pataa nahin chalaa
 Unless you are marginalized in politics, do not come to the center from the margins, you do not become a leader
 sushamaa swaraj bhi apwaad nahin thim
 The reason for this was his long political journey
 netaa bana banaaya nahin hota he, jo netaa hota he wo rose banataa he
 It varies between different challenges and questions
 aap kalpana kiijie sushamaa swaraj 25 saal kii umr se raajnneeti main thim
 She became a cabinet minister in Haryana at the same age
 42 saal ke raajnneetik jivan main sushamaa swaraj kin-kin zilon main gai hongi, gaanvon main gayi hongi, mohallon me gayi hongi, vahaan jinhone unhen suna hoga, wo aaj sushamaa ko kaise yaad karte honge, ham andaaza bhi nahin laga sakate
 She has gone from this world to include the love of countless people
 yah baat sirf sushamaa swaraj ke bare main nahin balki har us netaa ke bare main he jo lambey raajnneetik jivan main desh ko is chor se us chor tak naapta rahata he
 Why people were missing Sushma Swaraj on Twitter and Facebook today
 bahut kam netaa hote hai jo duusare dal ke netaaon ko apane jaisaa nazar aate hai
 There are very few leaders who appear to be in the other party while staying in their party
 sushamaa swaraj hameshaa bijepi kii hokar raheen magar lageen sabko apni
 This is the real earning of politics
 isliye virodhiyon ko lagata he ki sushamaa swaraj unke ghar se bhi gayi hai
 Sushma Swaraj must have suffered the pain of her own alien in the political frame where her last farewell has been
 bagair iske koi siyasay main safar puraa nahin karata he
 Someone must have gone to them, she must have been away from someone
 lekin jab aap netaa hote hai to aapke liye sab aate hai
 Your opponent, your opponent
 sushamaa swaraj ke liye sab aa rahe the
 She has left 42 years of political memories
 sushamaa swaraj kaa bhaashan sabko yaad he
 But why is it that all good speeches are remembered before 2014 and not after that
 kya 2014 ke baad kii sushamaa or 2014 ke pehle kii sushamaa main koi antar tha
 Of course, as foreign minister, he gave speeches in Parliament on a few occasions, but foreign policy was less recognized in his name, perhaps not
 adatan wo akelaa intervyuu dene main yakeen nahin karti thim
 Very few examples will be found
 press conference karti thim
 Till 2013, she was ahead of the stage, she was also seen as the prime ministerial candidate but after 2014 she never crossed the front line of the stage
 na hi aisa kuch kaha jisase agali pankti ke netaa uljhan main funsate
 Sushma has always been BJP
 unhone ek aisa mauka nahin diya jisase koi pradhanmantri or unke bich kii duuri par bahes kar sake
 Whenever it seemed that Sushma Swaraj gave any credit to the Prime Minister on the tweet
 ve netaa thim isliye apane netaa ko bhi netaa samajhati raheen
 One may object but never made public
 is baar shapath grahan samaaroh main unka aana or vahaan se chupchaap nepathy main chale janaa kisi ne notice main nahin liya
 Did not contest election of MP
 vidisha chhod vaidehi ho gayi
 Leaving the foreign minister's bungalow, she came to the three-room flat
 paanch saal videsh mantri rahakar gayi magar jab mantralay choda to shaayad hi kahin unki nitiyon or uplabdhiyon par charchaa hui, koi gambhir lekh dikhaa
 Sushma Swaraj also kept herself safe from journalists divided in the camp and journalists also avoided talking about her greatness and achievements after 2014
 sushamaa kaa akelaapan unke saath hi chalaa gaya
 Journalist Anita Saluja met him on Tuesday afternoon
 anita se sushamaa ne kaha ki ve dilli chhodkar nahin janaa chaahatin
 Her daughter Flute wants to be close to Swaraj
 bansuri ko dekhe bina chaiyn nahin aata he
 Anita has written that her face was glowing on 7 August
 puri baatcheet main ek baar bhi party kii shikaayat nahin kii
 He said that everything goes
 utaar chadhaav hote rahata he
 Two days before that, former MP Shahid Siddiqui met at the India International Center
 jab amit shah ne rajyasabha main jammu kashmir punargathan bill pesh kiya tab unhone twit kiya tha ki pradhanmantri ji aapkaa hardik abhinandan
 i was looking forward to seeing this day in my life
 raajnneeti main ek mahila kaa swatantra vajood banaae rakhana aasaan nahin hota he
 In terms of images, Sushma always looked like an ideal Indian woman
 unhone bhartiyata ko hameshaa paramparaon se paribhaashit kiya jo aresas kii kalpanaaon ke kareeb tha, ain thim jabaki samaajawaadee dhara se
 Sushma Swaraj wore a jacket over a sari, this was her signature
 zaahir he sirf ham or aap tay nahin karte ki netaa ko kaise dekhenge, netaa bhi tay karte hai ki unhen kaise dekha jaae
 Seeing the color of Sushma Swaraj's saree, it could be told which day is today or by looking at the day, in which saree Sushma ji will be seen
 aksar somvaar ko safed yaa dudhia rang kii sari pahenti thim
 Red pink or sentry on Tuesday died on Tuesday, wearing pink saris that day too
 buudhvaar ko hare rang kii sari pahenti thim
 When she visited Pakistan in 2015, there was criticism as to why she wore a dark green saree with Nawaz Sharif when Sushma said that she wore a green saree because it was Wednesday that day
 guuruuvaar ko pili sari pahana karti thim isliye jab kulbhushan yadav kaa parivaar unase milane aayaa to is tasviir main ve pili sari main dikh rahi hai
 Sarees wore shades of gray on Friday
 shanivaar ko kaali sari pahana karti thim, ravivaar ko jo rang pasand aa jaae, us rang kii sari pahenti thim
 Anita Saluja has written all this
 ek netaa apni shakhsiyat ko lekar kitni taiyaari karata he
 Is so alert
 netaa hawa main nahin banataa he, hawaaon se takaraakar banataa he
 His speech in the Lok Sabha in 1996 resonated on TV throughout the day
 sushamaa jab bolti thim to unki baat pahunchati thi
 Sushma Swaraj was also remembered on Twitter due to her activism
 jahangir kaa ghanta tha unka twitor handle
 Whenever there was trouble, the foreign minister started calling
 twitor par sabase adhik follow kii jane vaali duniya kii akeli netaa thim
 But Sushma Swaraj did not follow anyone
 aap unke twitor handle par jaakar dekh sakate hai, vahaan zero dikhegaa
 Neither followed the party president nor the Prime Minister
 vaise pradhanmantri 2200 logon ko follow karte hai
 You can see it through the spectacles of opposition but also see how autonomous the leaders are
 sabake saath hote hue bhi alag or akelaa dikhne kaa junun hota he
 Sometimes they are alone too
 ek hi march main netaa sabake saath chalata he usee march main vah akelaa bhi chalata he
 Someone tweeted that the passport has been stolen, what to do, the foreign minister used to come and tell the embassy, they will help
 kisi ke mata-pita turki main funs gaye the, unke kaagazat kho gaye the
 The foreign minister responded by tweeting that the work is done and will return tonight
 ve videsh mantri sirf rajanyik sambandhon ke liye nahin thim, balki videsh gaye bharatiyon kii bhi videsh mantri thim
 During her troubles, she used to act like a home minister
 ek ne twit kiya tha ki meraa bhai georgia main pachaas dinon se isiu main he, bharat laana chaahate hai, aapaki madad chahie
 So Sushma Swaraj helps
 isliye shaayad sushamaa swaraj ko aaj miss kiya ja rahaa he
 He played a role in evacuating Indians trapped in Yemen and citizens of 26 countries
 iraq main fanse 140 bharatiyon ko lekar wo sawaalon se takaraati raheen
 But he did not give up his efforts
 bagaiyr saboot ke mrit ghoshit karne se inkaar karti raheen or unka pataa lagaati raheen
 Sushma Swaraj is seen dividing into the new school and old school grooves
 kya baantne vaale apni suvidha se is vibhaajan kaa istemaal kar rahe hai yaa sushamaa vaaki nae skool main ajanabi ho gai thim
 In June last year, when a woman named Tanvi Seth complained that the passport officer in Lucknow had not accepted her application because she had married a Muslim, Sushma Swaraj called for action against the officer
 ek din baad tanvi kaa passport ban gaya tha
 Just followed the foreign minister of IT cell mentality on Twitter
 unke bare main abhadra bhashaa kaa istemaal hone laga
 It was said that Sushma Swaraj is trying to become secular
 muslim tushtikaran kar rahi hai
 His kidneys were mocked
 sushamaa swaraj bhi bhid gayi or abhadra bhashaa kaa istemaal karne vaale twitor handle ko like karne lageen or twitor par voting laanch kar diya ki kya is tarah kii bhashaa kaa istemaal hona chahie
 On Twitter, everyone stood with Sushma Swaraj but as the women journalists continued to troll the day, then Sushma Swaraj's lack of attitude was lacking
 yah sushamaa kii seemaa thi, netaa bagaiyr simaaon ke netaa nahin hota he
 There is hardly anyone who talks about Sushma Swaraj
 na bijepi main or na hi bijepi ke baahar
 But a leader should not be evaluated only by his merits
 uski kamiyon or simaaon se bhi hona chahie
 a good leader sees that someone is able to hold his boundaries properly
 bhale hi wo aapse inkaar karegaa lekin man hi man muskuraataa bhi he ki kisi ne use pakad liya
 Became the cabinet minister in Haryana and the Chief Minister of Delhi
 bellari ke reddy bandhuon ke kaaran vivaad main ain to sonia gandhi ko chunauti dene bellari pahunch gayi
 She said that if Sonia becomes Prime Minister, she will shave her head
 sushamaa swaraj pyaaz ke kaaran dilli kaa chunaav haar gayi lekin iske baad bhi unki dhak aisi rahi ki jab kidney badalane kaa vakt aayaa to kai log apni taraf se peshkash karne lage
 Even during Lalit Modi's escape, his name came up in controversies
 dilli main hariyaali teej ke vakt jhula jhulate hue sushamaa swaraj kii tasviir agle din akhabaaron main chapa karti thi
 Who does not remember Sushma doing Chava Chauth? swaraj kaushal se unki shaadi ke bhi dilachasp kisse hai
 Both of them married even after a different ideology, that too in an emergency
 ghar vaale shaadi se khush nahin the
 Those leaders were good, left a lot of memories and also the question that Sushma Swaraj had all the talent but she could not become Prime Minister, but is this the last regret of the list of achievements of any leader
 meri raay main use or sawaalon ke saaye main dekha janaa chahie
 It has been a political life of 42 years, not even a fraction of what i told you
 na netaa bananaa aasaan he or na hi netaa ko jaananaa aasaan
 Sushma Swaraj will be missed, her daughter Flute lit the flame

 The Supreme Court has given its verdict on the Ayodhya case
 dashakon puraane tathaa puure desh ko andolit karte rahe cese main aitihaasik faisla sunaate hue supreme court ne ayodhya main vivaadit bhoomi kaa kabza sarkari trust ko mandir banane ke liye de diya he, tathaa uttar pradesh ke isi pavitra shahar main ek 'pramukh' sthaan par masjid ke liye bhi jameen aavantit kii jaaegi
 In this case, the plaintiff was given Ramlala as a result of Lord Ramchandra

 Now the statement of senior BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani has come out in this matter
 unhone is faisle kaa swaagat karte hue kaha ki unka rukh sahi sabit hua
 He said, 'my words were confirmed by the decision of the Supreme Court, feeling very blessed by paving the way for the construction of the grand Ram temple in Ayodhya
 yah kshan meri kaamana purna hone kaa he, ishwar ne mujhe vishaal andolan main yogadan dene kaa avasar diya jo bharat ke swatantraaa andolan ke baad sabase bada andolan tha
 'advani said,' i have always emphasized that Ram and Ramayana have an honored place in India's culture and civilization
 bharat main or videsh main ram janmabhumi ek vishesh or pavitra sthaan rakhti he
 His beliefs and feelings were respected
 'adwani ne kaha, 'main court ke is faisle kaa bhi sammaan karata hum ki unhone ayodhya main masjid banane ke liye paanch acre jameen dene kaa faisla kiya
 He said, "today's decision is the culmination of a long and controversial process, which has played both judicial and non-judicial roles in various forums over the past several decades
" 'adwani ne kaha, 'ab jab ayodhya main lambey samay se chal rahe mandir-masjid vivaad kaa ant ho gaya he, samay aa gaya he ki sabhi vivaad or tikhepan ko peeche chhod den or sampradayik sahmati or shanti ko gale lagaaein
 Towards this end, i appeal to all sections of our diverse society to work together to strengthen India's national unity and integrity
 'adwani ne kaha, 'ramajnmabhumi andolan ke samay maine aksar kaha tha ki ayodhya main ram mandir ke nirmaan kaa asli uddeshy ek shandaar raashtra mandir kaa nirmaan karnaa he
 Let us dedicate ourselves today to that great mission
 ' After presenting Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, if you are thinking that now the pace of development will accelerate - we will also leave China behind, investment in infrastructure sector will be faster, money of foreign citizens will be invested in Indian markets through mutual funds, There will be transparency in the tax system, the entire black money racket will be exposed, the ghost of inflation will run away, the common man's life is alive In'll find see a positive change if you're thinking these things, you hundred percent wrong
 aam bajet 2011-12 ke baad isamen ek bhi cheez nahin hone vaali he
 There is not a single reason, so that you also realize the change in your life
 vitt mantri pranav mukherjee naa keval ek chapal netaa hai, balki ek maahir raajnneetijna bhi hai
 They know that a normal man entangled in the everyday bhagabhaga does not ask for much
 use bas itnaa bhar bhram rahanaa chaiye kii satta kii bagdor, kahin naa kahin uske jaise kisi shaks ke haathon main he
 And the one who has taken over the reins, he is well aware of the needs of the common man
 lihaaja, pranav mukherjee ko is baat kaa puraa andaja he ki kaise aam janata ko phuslaaya ja saktaa he
 Not only this, the Finance Minister also knows very well how economists and experts in economic affairs can be manipulated
 ab jaraa bajet bhaashan ke antim hisse par gaur kijiye
 Pranab Mukherjee said in his budget speech, 'as a direct tax it is estimated that our revenue loss will be 11,500 crores
 vahiin apratyaksh kar se sarkaar ko 11,300 karod rupee milane kii ummid he
 Overall, after all the announcements, the government will incur a loss of only 200 crores
 ’to sawaal ye uthta he ki vitt mantri ne aam janata ko kya diya ? sirf 200 karod rupee main aisa koun sa jaadooi mantra vittamantri ne phoonk diya ki aam janata kii jeb pehle se zyada baari ho jaye
 Just think, even a small scam in our country is worth a few hundred crores
 yahaan to puure saal main sarkaar ko aam janata kii bhalaai ke liye nuksaan uthaanaa bhi padegaa to sirf 200 karod rupee kaa
 There is also a loss
 darasal janata ke haathon kuch laga bhi nahin or naa hi aam aadmi ko is bajet se kuch khaas phayda hi hua
 If it has happened then the huge loss, about which the government has kept a silent silence
 jaraa gaur kijiye, tex slab main pherbadal karne ke baad vitt mantri ne aam janata ko keval 2060 rupee prati varsh kaa phayda pahunchaaya he
 We got this benefit when the government announced that nothing will have to be paid as tax for income up to one lakh 80 thousand rupees
 yani tex kii bachat hui 2060 rupee prati saal kii
 So brother, the government has put an extra 5 rupees 64 paise in your pocket everyday
 ji haa, aapke liye is bajet main sarkaar ne har din bachaaye hai 5 rupee 64 paise
 So, if you want, you can probably drink a cup of tea at a roadside tea shop
 haalanki ajtak ke daftar ke paas vaale chaay stall par agar aap chaay pinaa chahen, to har pyaali chaay ke liye aapako kharchane padate hai 9 rupee
 Overall, even after this tax saving, you will not be able to drink more than a cup of tea outside our office
 baaki baaten to khayr bhul hi jaaiye
 This is the rule that our Finance Minister has given to the great people of this great country
 bhai jab itani badi chhot mili he to sarkaar kuch badale main legi bhi
 You might not have noticed, but now getting sick is going to be very hard on your pocket
 kisi bhi privet aspataal main jo puri tareeke se airkandishnad ho usamen agar aap ilaaj karaane pahunche to ab aapako sarvice tex ke rup main 5 fisadi sarcharge dena hoga
 Not only this, you will also have to pay a separate surcharge of 5% for different types of diagnostic tests done in the hospital
 to kul milakar aapkaa medical bill ab kisi privet aspataal main 10 fisadi or bad jayega
 Not only this, lime will not take much
 agar aap in kisi bhi diagnostic centre se koi test bhi karaayege, to aapako kul bill kaa 5 fisadi sarcharge ke taur par dena hoga
 That is, the next time you fall ill, be prepared to pay surcharge along with medicine and doctor's fees
 sarkaar kahati he ki ye sarcharge sarkari aspataalon main ilaaj par lagu nahin hoga
 But if you tell me that the common man craving for treatment in the distressed government hospitals should now pay more money to the private center to save his life or lose his life due to lack of treatment in the government hospital
 ab aap ise kya kahenge– vittamantri kii kalakaari yaa aam aadmi kii laachaari
 If you have looked at the budget speech, then you will know that there are many provisions in the entire budget that throw dust in such eyes
 lekin sarkaar he ki vittamantri kii sooyeeboojh kii daad detii nahin thak rahi
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who was an economist, said clearly after the budget that in the current situation, Pranab Mukherjee has presented a better budget
 kya pradhanmantri ko is bajet kii khamiyaan nahin dikhaai de rahi thi
 Or simply say that the government has made up its mind to somehow pull out this year, in view of the preparations for the Lok Sabha elections after 2012, the government will consider public policies
 haa is baat kaa shrey to upie ko dena hi hoga ki is bajet ke jariye congress ne apni raajnneeti ko aage badhaane ke liye apane vot bank ko or majboot karne kaa puraa intjaam kiya he
 Just take a look - the amount spent for the social sector has been increased by 24 percent i
e
 Rs 40,000 crore in this budget
 ye rakam sidhe pahonchegi us tabake ke paas jise naregaa, bharat nirmaan, alpsankhyak shiksha kaarykram jaisi tamaam yojanaon se phayda pahunchataa he
 The government has increased the agricultural credit by 30 percent
 yani sarkaar ne ab kisaanon ko sasta karj dene ke liye 1 lakh karod kaa alag se intjaam kiya he
 Obviously, the effect of these provisions of the budget will be more on the people of rural areas or, say, rural voters
 or is phaayde ko bhunaayegi kagress party
 You will say that if the farmers and people of rural areas are doing well, then what is the problem? pareshaani is baat kii he ki sarkaar bhedbhaav kar rahi he
 For its vote bank, the government has opened a box of aid and the government reimburses the fiscal deficit for the people living in the cities
 ek or bajatiy praavdhaan jisapar gaur karne kii jarurat he
 In his speech, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee has also talked about giving cash subsidy on fertilizers, kerosene and cooking gas to the people living below the poverty line
 vitt mantri ne iske liye 2012 april kii samay seemaa nirdhaarit bhi kii he
 There is no rocket science in that this step of the government will make it easier for the UPA to come to power for the third time
 lekin ghaataa hoga to shaharon main rahane vaale logon or garibi rekha ke upar waalon ke liye
 See how
 rasoi gas kaa istemaal har koi karata he chaahe wo gaanv main rah rahaa ho yaa phir shahar main
 Today a gas cylinder costs Rs 380
 har silendar par sarkaar tel companiyon ko 220 rupee bataur sabsidi diya karti he
 Now, if the government sends the amount of subsidy, that is, 220 rupees, directly to the account of those living below the poverty line, then the price of gas cylinder in the market will be 600 rupees
 kyonki sarkaar raahat dena chaahati he garibi kii rekha ke neeche rahane waalon ko hi, naa ki madhyavarg yaa shahari varg ko jiske paas 600 rupee prati silendar keemat aada karne kii kuvat he
 In such a situation, the question arises that the economic condition of paying the price of Rs 600 is in the middle class
 bilkul nahin
 Everyone's waist will break and the budget of the house will collapse
 lekin sarkaar ne is masale par chuppi saadh rakhi he
 The government is only looking at how the benefits reach those who will vote for Congress
 ab aap khud hi sochiye pranav mukherjee ne bajet main chapaltaa dikhaai he yaa nahin
 Because the government's logic is clear
 sabsidi kaa paisa bichauliye kha jate he or ye paisa un tak nahin pahunchataa jinke liye hota he
 Therefore, the government is preparing to crack down on corruption
 lekin is taiyaari main ghun kii tarah pis jaayegaa madhyavarg– jisaki chintaa kisi ko philhal nahin he
 Overall, if we look at this year's budget, it would not be wrong to say that we have not moved even an inch ahead of last year's budget
 bajet main aisa kuch bhi nahin kaha gaya he ki aakhir saamaajik or gramin kshetron ke liye kharch kiye jane vaale paison kaa intjaam sarkaar kaise karegi
 This year, the government reduced the budgetary deficit to a large extent by showing the revenue generated from the auction of 3G spectrum
 lekin agle saal sarkaar kii yojana saarvajanik upakramon main vinievesh or sarkari bondon ke jariye paisa ikattha karne kii he– joki kisi bhi keemat par apana lakshya puraa nahin kar sakati
 This clearly shows that the government has no clear plan for revenue collection
 mahangaai abhi bhi chintaa kaa vishay bani hui he
 In such a situation, if it is said that 'sab Rama is trust', then it will not be wrong
 purvi dilli ke liye ek behtareen connactivity kaa saadhan banane ja rahemetro lineke ek hisse ko 31 oktober ko aam janata ke liye khol diya jayega

 Former India bowling coach Joe Dawes has raised doubts that the ICC World Cup 2015 semi-final match against Australia on Thursday will miss the best bowler like Wahab Riaz of defending champion India Copakistan
 saath hi dawes ne yah bhi kaha ki pichley dinon australia ke khilaaf kharaab pradarshan bhi team india par maansik dabaav banane kaa kaam karegaa
 Dawes was the bowling coach of Team India from February 2012 to October 2014
 newspaper 'sidney morning herald' ke anusaar pakistan world cap se baahar ho chukaa he lekin riyaj kaa quarter final main kiya gaya pradarshan abhi bhi toornament main charchaa kaa vishay bana hua he
 Riaz bowled a superb bowling performance to Australia opener David Warner and captain Michael Clarke and also troubled Shane Watson
 australia haalanki yah match chah wicket se jeetne main kaamyaab rahaa or semifinal main pahunchaa
 According to Dawes, the Indian team has bowlers like Mohammad Samee, Umesh Yadav and Mohit Sharma who have performed well in this World Cup, but Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team will miss the left-arm bowler like Riaz
 dawes ke anusaar baayen haath ke tej gendbaaj is world cap main bahut safal rahe hai, lekin bharat ke paas aisa koi gendbaaj nahin he jo riyaj jaisaa pradarshan kar sake
 Dawes said, 'I think they have all the measures that they can beat the biggest team, it is just a matter of whether they remain the same in putting the ball in the right field that day
 puri garmi ke dauraan unhone aisa nahin kiya he

 However, Section 139AA of the Income Tax Act also states that Aadhaar will not have to provide Aadhaar for filing income tax returns or for making PAN card, which are not considered as local residents in Aadhaar Act-2016

 upi ke gorakhpur or phulpur upachunaav main bijepi bhale hi haar gai ho, lekin congress ke liye phir bhi buree khabar hi he
 In fact, the Congress could not even save its bail, bypassing the alliance in both the seats
 ab upi main rashtriya party ke naam par mahagathbandhan main zyaada siten ladane kii tamanna ko bada jhatka laga he
 Despite all the efforts of Chitta Akhilesh on his own, the Congress did not withdraw its candidates in both the seats and the party candidates could not save the bail
 darasal, congress ke prabharee mahasachiv ghulaam nabi aaazaad kaa daanv tha ki congress alag ladegi to dabaav main aakar yaa to sapa se ek ek seat par samjhauta ho jayega, or nahin to bijepi ke donon siton par jeetne kii surat main 2019 main sapa basapa par mahagathbandhan main congress zyaada siton ke liye dabaav bana legi
 Alam is that the Congress gave a ticket to a Brahmin from Phulpur and Sunita Karim from Gorakhpur
 zyaada vivaad gorakhpur seat ko lekar hua, jahaan kii ummidavaar muslim kii patni thim, congress ko lagata tha ki muslim maton ke bantane ke dar se sapa ek seat congress ko de degi
 When the BSP-SP equation was not considered independent despite several rounds of negotiations, Akhileshne shocked the Congress by talking to the BSP chief Mayawati and won both the seats without giving a big blow to the Congress
 ab congress kaa baikfoot par aana laazmi tha
 The party is also afraid of fearing that it is advocating an alliance, forgetting the differences against the Modi government itself
 sonia gandhi iske liye dinar diplomasi kar rahi hai or upi main party isi ke ulat kadam uthaa rahi he
 Congress high command fears The Congress high command also fears that it will no longer be forced to surrender to the SP BSP in the grand alliance
 aakhir upachunaav se thik pehle mayawati kii naaraazgi ko kinare karke basapa se nikaale gaye nasimuddin siddiki ko congress main shaamil kara liya
 Not only this, he started discussing with Shivpal Yadav about joining the party, due to which Akhilesh's eyebrows were decided
 ab party ko ye dikkat bhi he ki agar 2014 ke lihaaj se tikat bantwaare kaa formula 2019 ke liye tay hua to sirf 2 siton par congress jiti thi or 4 siton par wo duusare number par rahi thi
 In such a situation, now the attitude of the Congress on BSP and SP is soft
 'ajtak' se baatcheet main pradesh adhyaksh rajbabbar ne kaha ki nasimuddin ko tab jwoin karaayaa jab ve kisi dal main nahin the, isliye kisi ko naaraaz karne kaa sawaal nahin he
 At the same time, Raj Babbar said about Shivpal that neither we talked to him nor we are doing
 ummid he ki 2019 main mahagathbandhan banegaa
 Now Ghulam Nabi Azad and State President Raj Babbar are certain to be on the back foot in view of the latest political equation
 haalanki faislon kii zimmedaari aaazaad kii rahi
 That is why according to sources, UP can be withdrawn from Azad in the soon-to-be reshuffle
 baikfoot par rajbabbarawahin rajbabbar ke adhyaksh banane ke baad party vidhansabha ke baad nikaay chunaav bhi buree tarah haari, or ab taaja upachunaav kaa riselt saamne he
 In the past, Raj Babbar himself has offered resignation to Rahul
 rajbabbar ke karibiyon ke mutabik, ab ek baar phir rahul se milakar adhyaksh pad chhodane kii peshkash kar sakate hai

 With this, Marathas will get reservation in educational institutions and government jobs in the state
 isse pehle pichhadaa ayog kii report main maratha samudaay ko saamaajik, aarthik or shaikshanik aadhaar par pichhadaa mana gaya tha
 After this, the Maharashtra government had said, 'we will discuss this report in the cabinet meeting
 ham maraathon ko aarakshan dene ke liye bill laaenge or vidhansabha se kanoon paarit karavaaenge
 If someone will challenge this law in court, only then we will present this report in court
 'bataa den ki maraathon ke aarakshan kii maang 1980 ke dashak se lambit padi he
 The State Backward Commission examined the Marathas being backward on social, educational and economic grounds on 25 different parameters
 isamen se sabhi maanakon par maraathon kii sthiti dayaneey pai gai
 During this survey, the status of 43 thousand Maratha families was known
 iske alaava jan sunwaayiyon main mili kareeb 2 karod gyapanon kaa bhi adhyayan kiya gaya
 In its report submitted to the Maharashtra government, the State Backward Classes Commission, in its report, recommended that the Marathas be increased to 27 per cent quota of the other backward castes

 Sources in the commission said, "the commission has not told the government how much reservation should be given to the Marathas

 It is known that the Marathas were demanding 16 per cent reservation
 saal 2016 se lekar is maamle main puure rajya main 58 march nikaale gaye

 yah maamla court ke saamne lambit hone se sarkaar ne pichde ayog ko maratha samudaay kii saamaajik, aarthik or shaikshanik sthiti jaanane kii jimmedaari di thi
 The trouble for the Fadnavis government was compounded when an OBC faction in the state said that Maratha community should be given separate reservation from the 27 per cent quota
 iske alaava aurangabad jile main kakasaheb scindia ne aarakshan kii maang ko lekar ek nahar main kudakar jaan de di thi

 Former President and veteran Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee attended the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) program in Nagpur on Thursday
 unke saath sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat bhi rahe
 At the event held at the RSS headquarters in Nagpur, Pranab Mukherjee taught nationalism to the RSS volunteers
 samaaroh main shaamil hone ke kuch der baad pranab kii ek photo soshal media par viral ho gai he
 The photo shows Pranab Mukherjee greeting other Sangh volunteers
 haalanki, pranab mukherjee ne aisa nahin kiya tha
 rss's co-head of action Dr
 Dr
 manmohan vaidya ne bayaan diya he
 He said that some divisive political elements have posted a picture related to an RSS event held in Nagpur on Thursday, showing former President Pranab Mukherjee in a prayer position during the Sangh prayer
 manmohan ne kaha ki inhen takaton ne pranab ko is samaaroh main bhaag lene se rokane ke liye virodh bhi kiya tha
 And now these desperate forces are doing such cheap tricks to discredit the Sangh
 ham jaanboojhkar sangh ko badnaam karne ke liye in vibhaajankaree takaton ddhara chalaai ja rahi aisi chaalon kii ninda karte hai
 Earlier, Pranab's daughter Sharmishtha Mukherjee tweeted the picture
 isi par sharmishtha ne likhaa ki jis baat kaa unhen dar tha or apane pita ko jis bare main unhone aagaah kiya tha, vahi hua
 He alleged that the "dirty Tricks Department" of BJP / RSS did what he feared
 unhone kaha ki soshal media par chhedchhad kii gai tasveeron main aisa najar aa rahaa he ki purv raashtrapati sangh netaaon or kaaryakartaaon kii tarah abhivadan kar rahe hai
 Sharmistha had opposed that Sharmishtha Mukherjee had opposed it before Pranab Mukherjee joined the RSS program
 sharmishtha ne twit karte hue likhaa tha ki ummid he aaj kii ghatana ke baad pranab mukherjee is baat ko maanenge ki bijepi kis had tak ganda khel sakati he
 He wrote that even the RSS will not believe that you will support his views in your speech
 unhone kaha ki bhaashan to bhula diya jayega, lekin tasviren bani rahengi or unako nakli bayanon ke saath prasaarit kiya jayega
 Taught to volunteers, former President Pranab Mukherjee as the chief guest of rss's third year Sangh Shiksha Varg program said that nationalism in India is not of one language and one religion
 pranab ne kaha ki bharat kii takat uski sahishnutaa main nihit he or desh main vividhta kii puja kii jaati he
 Therefore, if an attempt is made to define nationalism on the basis of any particular religion, particular province, hate and intolerance in the country, it will tarnish our national image
 pranab mukherjee ne kaha ki vah is manch se raashtra, rashtrawaad or deshbhakti par apana mat rakhane ke liye bulaae gaye hai
 It is not possible to see these three words separately
