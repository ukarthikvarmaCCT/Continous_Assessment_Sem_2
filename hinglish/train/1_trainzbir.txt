 ek aurat ke kirdaar main apane dance or dressing ko sahi karne ke liye gaurav khub mehnat kar rahe hai or unhen yah baat samaj aa rahi he ki yah sab itnaa aasaan nahin he
 During the dance rehearsals, Gaurav is also being provided with accessories for the pinch character so that everything is perfect

 Among our earliest memories of Ambedkar, he is seen in the idol at the corner of our town
 din-raat dhul phaankate hue or chirai-churgunon kii biton se sarabor
 Because of Ambedkar's blue suit and the lack of money and the upheaval of emotions, i have seen most of his sculptures made out of disorganization and disorganization
 ek baar to shahar ke pokhar ke muhane par lagi unki murti kii kisi ne gardan bhi utaar di thi
 At that time, it was not possible to know which name Ambedkar is
 haalankikitabomen hameshaa yah padhane ko miltaa tha ki ve aaazaad bharat ke pehle kanoon mantri the or unhone hi bharat ke samvidhan ke nirmaan kiya tha
 When he reached the university after failing from the school, he found that Ambedkar was an outgoing person
 kya gajab kii baaten karata tha
 Instead of going to the temple, he used to go to the library and his supporters today are bent on building his own idols and temples
 uttar pradesh kii purv mukhya mantri mayawati ne unki murtiyon or smarak banavaane main itnaa rajkeey kosh kharch kar diya ki usamen bhukh se tadap rahe lakhon logon kaa pet bharaa ja saktaa tha
 Items of primary need could be provided to them
 ambedkar jisane kisitthakthith rupase pragatisheel dharm ko aainaa dikhaane kaa kaam kiya
 Who instead of turning his back on all kinds of chaos within the religion, decided to give him two or two hands
 daliton, mahilaon or mazdooron ko shikshit, sangathit or sangharsh karne kii prerana di
 Who, after being born in Hinduism, did not insist on his own, adopted Buddhism in the last days
 jisane manusmriti kaa dahan kiya or puraani or rudh ho chuki parampara ko todane ke liye har sambhav prayaas kiya
 But there is one thing about Ambedkar that still stings me in my chest and teases why this person who could teach the whole world the slogan of education and struggle could not teach his wife

 sadan main bahes ke dauraan neshnal conference ke saansad hasanan masudi ne is bill kaa virodh kiya or dhara 370 par bhi apni baat rakhi

 is dauraan sadan main hangaamaa hua or grih mantri amit shah ne is bayaan kaa virodh kiya
 Amit Shah said that he is saying far from the truth
 unhone kaha ki shyama prasad mukherjee ne kabhi bhi anuchhed 370 kaa samarthan nahin kiya
 If you are saying this, then also make reference to it before the House
 amit shah ne kaha ki bolne kaa adhikaar kaa matlab ye nahin kii aap jhooth bolen
 The Home Minister said that Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had given his life to remove Section 370
 grih mantri bole ki saansad ko is baat kaa zikr karnaa chahie ki vah kis tathy kaa sandarbh lekar yah baat kah rahe hai
 BJP mps created a lot of uproar over this statement of the National Conference MP
 unhone kaha ki vah apni baat kah sakate hai uskaa ham virodh nahin kar rahe hai lekin unhen iske saath sandarbh bhi rakhana chahie
 Amit Shah said that at that time the Constituent Assembly was making the Constitution according to its own accord
 shyama prasad mukherjee cabinet kaa hissaa the lekin iskaa matlab ye nahin he ki vah dhara 370 ke samarthan main the
 Not only Amit Shah but Defense Minister Rajnath Singh also opposed the statement of National Conference MP Hasnain Masoodi and said that they should either present the facts before the House or they should apologize
 hasanan masudi ne is dauraan maang karte hue kaha ki sadan main samvidhan sabha kii bahes ko saamne rakhaa janaa chahie, jisamen 370 par charchaa hui he
 Masoodi said that Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was then a part of the cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru's government and the decision was passed unanimously
 unhone kaha ki mukherjee ne bhi samvidhan sabha main iskaa samarthan kiya tha or unki sahmati se 370 laayaa gaya tha
 However, later Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla also said that whatever mps are putting forth their points, they should also keep the facts together

 patna ke jalajmav ne nagar vikaas vibhaag, uske antargat nagar nigam, budanko jaisi sanstha ke saath-saath raajnneetik dal or unke netaaon kii bhi pole khol kar rakh di
 In this, some more internal controversy broke out in the ruling BJP and there was no doubt about who are the supporters of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in the BJP and who are the opponents? In the pretext of Nitish's criticism, many leaders also kept their political agenda open
 
 jahaan nitish kumaar ke samarthan main bihar bhaajapa ke do varisht netaa susheel modi or nand kishor yadav ek baar phir khadey dikhe
 At the same time, Union Minister Giriraj Singh openly opposed Nitish Kumar, who started weaving the political fabric from last one month
 unhone apane virodh ke pattey sarkaar kii aalochana ke naam par ek baar phir khul kar khele
 In this, he also joined Bihar's Urban Development Minister Suresh Sharma and Bihar bjp's newly appointed President Sanjay Jaiswal
 haalanki, suresh sharma ne 'adhikari meri baat nahin sunate the' vaala raag chhedaa
 But his move was overshadowed, because in twenty-four hours an old video of him appeared, in which he is building a bridge to praise the same officer, for whom he made this statement
 suresh sharma ko maaloom hai ki jal jamaav ke kaaran unki kaabiliyat par har koi sawaal uthaa rahaa he to aise main giriraaj singh ke peeche khadaa hona unhen surakshit laga
 Bihar Deputy CM Sushil Modi, who is himself facing criticism in this waterway, tweeted, "NDA is united and Nitish is a capable ruler
" is bayaan ke jariye unhone party kaaryakartaaon ke bich gathbandhan ke bhavishya ko lekar sanshay khatm karne kii koshish kii
 But Janata Dal United leaders now realize that Giriraj Singh is constantly targeting Nitish Kumar, and that a section of the BJP (including the top leadership) has got his tacit approval
 aane vaale din main bhi kisi naa kisi bahaane aise unhen nicha or vifal dikhaane kii koshish kii jaaegi
 He has also realized that Nitish Kumar will be criticized more by his own allies than his political opponents
 haalanki, bhaajapa netaa bhi maanate hai ki nitish kumaar ke liye yah raajnneetik laabh he ki unke aalochak jis jati se aate hai, unka mukhar or aakraamak hona nitish samarthakon ko utana hi ekajute or lamaband karata hai
 Secondly, the aggressiveness with which the minister and spokesperson of the Janata Dal United has now come to the defense of Nitish, it is clear from their side that they will not tolerate unnecessary criticism against their leader for running the government at present
 janata dal united ke netaaon kaa kahana he ki adhikari kii taraf se khami rahi he, lekin iske kiye sabhi adhikariyon ko katghare main khadaa kar apmaan karnaa bhi sarkaar main baithe logon ke liye ek galat parampara kii shuruyaat he
 Due to online shopping, the market is starting to fade
 bheed-bhaad vaale bazaaron main khatre ke dar or internet par zyada opshan ke chalate log aaj kal baari taadaad main online shopping karne lage hai
 The fear of going to crowded markets and their safety has started making people so much that now the buyers are preferring to shop on the internet instead of going to the market
 asocham ke ek survey ke mutabik asuraksha kii bhaavana or online shopping par zyada opshan milane ke kaaran i-commers bijnes main 250 fisadi se zyada kaa oochaal dekha gaya he
 Assocham Secretary General DS Rawat said, 'we have seen that every person in the crowd is worried about the safety of himself and his children
 aajkal internet sevi log hai, joki bahut badi taadaad main hai
 This has two benefits, one is that they escape from the crowded place, while there is no danger of them
 ek phayda yah bhi he ki online shopping main utpaadon ke alag-alag variety bhi dekhne ke maukey mil jate hai
 'online shopping has gained momentum due to online discounts, rising fuel prices and more options
 asocham kii is report ke mutabik dilli main sabase zyada internet istemaal karne vaale 71 fisadi log olanin shopping karnaa pasand karte hai, jabaki maatr 21 fisadi log bazaaron main jaakar kharidari karnaa pasand karte hai
 In Mumbai, 55 per cent of people prefer everyday shopping and 69 per cent for gift items
 ahmedabad main online shopping karne waalon kaa aankada is saal badhkar 65 fisadi tak ja saktaa he
 40% of internet users in Kolkata prefer to shop online
 survey ke mutabik online shopping main ye badhat isliye bhi ai he kyonki log pichley kuch saalon ke dauraan hue haadason ke kaaran bazaaron main jane se kataraane lage hai
 Traders also believe that people are coming less in the markets for fear of an accident
 sarojini nagar market association ke pressindet omadatt sharma kehete hai,' log jis tarah se pehle kharidari karte the wo ab nahin rahi kyonki suraksha ko lekar log bazaar main aane se batch rahe hai

 The bjp-shiv Sena has a tough fight, with three parties giving a tough fight to the BJP - the Congress, its ally Nationalist Congress Party and the deprived Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), the party of newcomer Prakash Ambedkar this time
 vipaksh kaa darja paane vaali congress-ensipi ko is baar 98 siton se santosh karnaa padaa, vahiin vanchit bahujan aghadi ek bhi seat nahin jeet pai
 An analysis of these results suggests that if VBA had joined hands with congress-ncp in these elections, Maharashtra would have held a hung assembly like Haryana, in which no one would have a majority to form the government
 siton kaa aankalaipane vishleshan ke liye india today data intelligence unit ne un sabhi siton kaa aankalan kiya, jahaan bhaajapa ne jeet darj kii or un siton par congress / ensipi or vibie ko praapt hue voton kaa pratishat jod diya
 After adding the vote shares of these three parties, it was found that there would have been around 34 seats where the power of three would have won and BJP would have lost
 aisa hone se congress-ensipi-vibie ko bahumat se kam lekin lagbhag (138) siten praapt hotin or bhaajapa ghatakar 128 par rah jaati
 In such a situation, no single party or coalition would have enough data to form a government

 The team of Delhi Capitals, who scored a hat-trick of victories with the outstanding performance of Kagiso Rabada, one of the finest bowlers in the world, will look to continue the winning campaign in the IPL match against Mumbai Indians today
 is dauraan phir se nigahen rishabh pant par tiki rahengi jo vishwa cap team main jagah nahin paane ke kaaran charchaa ke centre main hai
 Delhi and Mumbai both have ten points from eight matches each and will try to consolidate their position for the playoffs by winning here
 dilli abhi behatar ran rate ke aadhaar par duusare or mumbai tisare sthaan par he
 The Indian selectors have preferred veteran Dinesh Karthik over Pant for the World Cup to be held in England
 iske baad yah pehla match hoga or yah yuva wicketiper ballebaaj pichley do din kii ghatnaon ko bhulaakar acha pradarshan karke apane samarthakon main josh bharna chahega
 Pant had played a stormy innings of 78 off 27 balls in the first match against Mumbai, which Delhi won the match by 37 runs
 mumbai ke gendbaajon ke liye jahaan pant, shikhar dhawan, shreyas ayyar or prithvi shaw ko rokna chunauti hogi vahiin uske ballebaajon ke liye rabada ke tufaan se paar paanaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Rabada's role has been instrumental in the five matches that Delhi has won so far
 is dakshin africa tej gendbaaj ne ab tak 17 wicket liye hai or hamawatan kris morris (11 wicket) ne unka acha saath nibhaayaa he

 mumbai ne pichley match main bengalooru ko haraakar do haar ke baad jeet darj kii
 Viewers will expect an interesting battle between Rohit Sharma and Rabada, but it will be interesting to see how Mumbai's most successful batsman, Quinton de Kock and Hardik Pandya, who went on a rampage in the death overs, face them
 dilli ke ballebaajon visheshkar shaw or pant jaise yuva khilaadiyon ko jasprit bumraah or lasith malinga jaise tej gendbaajon se nipatna hoga
 It will be interesting to see how the attitude of these two batsmen, who are being called the future of Indian cricket, in front of these bowlers

 In batting, Hardik Pandya often batted briskly in the final overs to bring the team to a good score

 If you leave out the dedicated workers of Bharatiya Janata Party and big leaders of other political parties, then there will be few people who will know about our ideals Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and Deen Dayal Upadhyay
 lekin mahatma gandhi ke bare main sabko pataa he isliye narendra modi ke netritv main party kii sarkaar banane ke baad pratikon ke rup main gandhi ko apni taraf laane kii safal koshish hui
 After that it was thought that what could be the second symbol, then Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar's name came and we have decided to give the message that Ambedkar was the leader of all, not of any particular community
 isi kadi main ab hamen pashchim bengal main paith banani he to uskaa tarika netaji subhaashachandr bose ko lekar ab tak bane rahasy se paradaa uthaakar kadam aage badhanaa he
 This comment of a BJP leader exposes the future political thinking of the BJP through the symbols of the communities
 darasal bijepi or sangh parivaar ko ehsaas he ki modi lahar main samaaj ke sabhi tabakon ke log apane kshetreey netaaon se mohabhang hone kii vajah se bijepi kii ore aae
 The bjp's Dalit vote bank doubled in the 2014 general election compared to the last Lok Sabha election, and for the first time the BJP sat in power with a big mandate of 282 seats
 nishchit rup se log duusari partiyon se tuutakar aae hai isliye sangh parivaar ne daliton ko saath jodgaye kii ek samgr niti banaai he jis par ranneetik taur se kaam shuru ho gaya he
 It has been started by the Sangh and BJP by organizing an aggressive policy to make Babasaheb, considered the messiah of Dalits, by organizing more than 300 programs across the country on the occasion of 125th birth anniversary of Ambedkar
 kaise aae bijepi ke agenda par ambedkarloksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko mili janadesh main dalit voton kaa bada yogadan tha
 In 2009, BJP got 21 seats in the Dalit dominated area, then in 2014 it increased to 73
 isliye bijepi ne is nae votaron ko saath jodgaye kii ranneeti par focus kiya
 BJP leaders believe that while there is talk of development, all these voters cannot be provided jobs or any direct benefit
 lihaaja party ne pratikon ke jariye sandesh dene kii ranneeti ko aage badhaayaa
 Ambedkar's birth anniversary was earlier held by the bjp's SC Morcha, but this time the main team of the party took direct command
 dalit netaa or pehali baar bijepi se saansad bane udit raaj party ke agenda main ambedkar ke ubhaar ko darshanik andaaj main dekhte hai, ''jab jaago tabhi savera
 The BJP also felt that Dr
 ambedkar kaa jo sangharsh or antim lakshya tha vahi bijepi kii bhi soch he
 He says that the party has seen the firepower of the middle class, intellectual and officer class that emerged from the Dalit society and this is an attempt to increase the base due to Ambedkar
 lekin bijepi ke netaa or purv kendriya mantri arun shouri kii ambedkar ke khilaaf likhi gai kitaab ''da varshipping of falls god'' ko ve 2004 main bijepi kii haar kii ek badi vajah maanate hai
 He says that just as Jaswant Singh was sent out of the party for writing a book on Jinnah, in the case of Shourie, the party should have shown the same attitude at that time
 haalanki kendriya saamaajik nyaay evam aadhikarita mantri thavarchand gahalot kehete hai, ''bijepi kii soch sakaaratmak he or jansangh ke jamaane se ham log ambedkar ko sammaan dete rahe hai
 But i am sad that today people are making it a matter of discussion
 '' lekin vaajapeyi sarkaar main mantri or bijepi essi morcha ke adhyaksh rah chuke sanjay paswan yah kehane se koi gurej nahin karte ki party kii ranneeti chunaav main ambedkarwaadiyon ke mili vot ko rokna he
 He says, "congress talked about campaigning for Ambedkar to regain its lost base, so why would the BJP lag behind
" hamaara makasad congress ko rokna he
 However, he believes that there has been pressure from Dalit leaders to bring Ambedkar on the party's main agenda
 ''lekin shouri kii kitaab par unke tevar bhi talkh hai or ve kehete hai ki yah bhi dekhnaa chahie ki shouri aaj party main kis kinare khadey hai
 However, on the bjp's strategy of giving prominence to Ambedkar, Mahatma Gandhi in charge of the Department of Buddhist Studies in International Hindi University, Dr
 surajeet kumaar singh sawaal uthaate hai
 He says, "the BJP has now realized that Babasaheb is the only person whose idols are present in every city, village in the country that people have built with their donations
" jabaki anya netaaon kii pratimaayein sarkaron ne banaai he
 Ambedkar has become an ideology, not a symbol
 ''viraasat kabjane kii taiyaaribijepi ab ambedkar se jude tamaam smarakon ko bhavyata dekar party dalit vot bank ko sandesh dena chaahati he
 Modi government on Janpath Road in Lutyens zone of Delhi Rs 192 crore
 kii laagat se aath manjila bhavy imaarat bana rahi he, jisaki aadharshila 20 april ko khud piem modi rakhenge
 It has been named Ambedkar International Center which will have halls, libraries etc
 just like Vigyan Bhawan
 iske alaava 26 alipur road jahaan ambedkar kaa parinirvana (dehavsaan) hua tha, vahaan 100 karod ru
 Preparations have been made to build a grand memorial at a cost of Rs
 If you were studying in London in 1921-22, the process of buying that house has started by the BJP government of the Center and Maharashtra

 Ambedkar Institute has been given the status of State University in Madhya Pradesh on the occasion of his birth anniversary
 dalit ke dwaar dastak kaarykramudhar bijepi centre main sarkaar hone kaa phayda uthaa rahi he, to sangh bhi apni chhavi durust karne kii kavayad main jute chukaa he
 The Sangh had decided to awaken social harmony by giving the slogan of a temple, a well and a crematorium at the All India House of Representatives meeting held in March
 ab sangh ne dalit dwaar dastak kaarykram chalaane kaa man banaaya he
 In private conversations, Sangh leaders believe that the image of the RSS is still that of an organization with upper class influence
 dalit samaaj ko sangh se jodgaye kii kavayad praathmik str se hogi
 The Sangh has now decided to give responsibility to the Dalits in the committees of Mandal, Basti and Mohalla Sangh, the initial level units of the Sangh
 sutron kii maane to sangh ne jald hi samaaj main bharosa banane ke liye pradhanmantri modi ke saath dalit mahilaon ko bhojan kaa kaarykram yojit karaane kii bhi ranneeti banaai he
 Panchjanya, the mouthpiece of the Sangh, published special material on Ambedkar which was launched on a large scale, for the first time more than three lakh copies of this mouthpiece were printed
 paanchajnya ke sampadak hitesh shankar kehete hai ki ambedkar pehali baar mukhpatr ke aavaran par nahin chape hai, unki 100veen jayanti par bhi ambedkar ko sthaan diya gaya tha
 But in response to the question that Panchajanya did not embrace Babasaheb's views against Hinduism, he says, "hedgewar and Ambedkar's views on untouchability were one
" ek hi kalkhand ke do manishiyon kii pidaa saamaajik vishyon par ek jaisi thi
 The Sangh always thinks of adding instead of breaking, so the same things have been printed in Panchjanya
 '' lekin muslim virdohi vichaaron ko chhaantkar prakashit karne par unki daleel he, ''babasaheb ke paas pope, nizaam ke log aae, magar unhone kaha tha ki main isaiyat yaa islam sweekaar karata hum to desh ek bade khatre main chalaa jayega isliye main usee raste ko chun rahaa hum jo is desh ke moulik tatv gyaan se judaa he
 In the launch of Panchjanya's special issue, Sarkaryavah Bhaiyyaji Joshi of the Sangh raised the question that Mother Teresa was given the Bharat Ratna before Ambedkar
 unhone kaha ki ambedkar kiske the, yah sawaal bachakaana he
 The Sangh has also planned to organize mass marriages of Dalits through ancillary organizations
 aasaan nahin bharosa jeetne kii raahaarakshan ke masale par sangh ko virdohi mana jaataa he
 The reason for this is that when the Mandal Commission report came into force, the saffron camp came down on the movement
 duusari mushkil padonnati main aarakshan bill kii he
 The BJP did not take a clear stand when the bill came to Parliament during the UPA government
 haalanki hitesh shankar kehete hai ki sangh ne 1989 main hi aarakshan ke prastaav ko sweekaar kar liya tha
 He says that when this issue was placed before the Union's fourth Sarsanghchalak Rajju Bhaiya on the basis of merit and efficiency, he said that if quality decreases then it can be tolerated, but society should not be broken
 aise main sawaal he ki kya modi sarkaar padonnati main aarakshan bill ko jald paarit karaayegi?haalanki in sawaalon se itar bijepi-sangh parivaar ne philhal dow
 By making Ambedkar a means, he has prepared a long-term plan to help the Dalit society

 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati has surrounded the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the violence in Kasganj, Uttar Pradesh
 mayawati ne bhaajapa par tanj kasate hue kaha ki maujuuda halaat se sabit hota he ki bhaajapa and company kaa har str par ‘ghor apradheekaran’ ho chukaa he
 Hinsamayavati, which took place in the bjp-ruled states, said in a statement that in the bjp-ruled states, especially Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan and Maharashtra, etc
, with the control of crime and law and order, public and development are in bad shape
 isse yah sabit hota he ki bhaajapa and company kaa har str par ghor apradheekaran ho gaya he
 He gave the example of Kasganj, referring to the disturbance in Kasganj in Uttar Pradesh, that there is Jungle Raj in the state
 iskaa taaja udhaaharan kasganj kii ghatana he jahaan hinsa kii aag ab bhi shant nahin hui he
 The BSP, along with its strong condemnation, demands strict punishment of the culprits

 " The cricket world was shaken by former South African captain Hansie Cronje being involved in match-fixing and 13 years after the incident, Delhi Police on Monday filed a charge sheet against the cricketer and five others in the court here
 is chargeshit main kisi anya cricketer kaa naam nahin he
 The chargesheet was filed in front of Magistrate Aakash Jain as Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Amit Bansal is on leave
 yah 90 pej kii chargeshit mangalvaar ko bansal ke saamne rakhi jaaegi
 Police have placed Cronje in the second column in the charge sheet, who died in an air crash in 2002
 unke alaava paanch anya main tii siries ke sansthaapak gulshan kumaar ke bhai krishna kumaar, landan ke sattebaaj sanjeev chawla, sattebaaj manmohan khatter, dilli ke sattebaaj rajesh kalra or sunil daara urf bittu ko aropi bataaya gaya he
 According to police sources, most of the Kings Commission report in the charge sheet is based on Cronje's confession and telephone conversations
 13 saal puraane phixing ke is maamle main dilli police ne khulaasa kiya tha ki march 2000 main bharat or south africa ke bich khelaa gaya ek van de match fiks tha
 Police had said that he had tapped a phone conversation between bookie Sanjeev Chawla and Cronje, who live in London

 a political struggle has been launched on the 100 secret files of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose made public
 congress kaa aarope he ki modi sarkaar filon ko saarvajanik kar raajnneetik phayda hasil karne kii koshish main he, vahiin netaji ko 'yuddh apradhi' kahe jane ke daawey par bhi sawaal uthne lage hai
 According to the Khosla Commission, the country's first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru called Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose the war criminal of the British, while Nehru told the Shahnawaz Commission that he did not consider Netaji to be a war criminal
 is ore saamne aae dastavej ke paanchave anuchhed main saaf shabdon main likhaa gaya ki nehru ne bose ko yuddh apradhi nahin mana tha
 In 1956, Jawaharlal Nehru told the Shahnawaz Commission on Netaji's death that he did not consider Subhash Chandra Bose a war criminal
 jabaki ek anya dastavej ke mutabik purv pradhanmantri ne tatkaaleen british piem atali ko likhe patr main netaji ko yuddh apradhi kahkar sambodhit kiya tha
 The Congress has called it a fake document
 kya he atali ko likhi chitthee menkhosla kamishan ke mutabik, jawaharlal nehru ne 27 disambar 1945 ko england ke tab ke piem clement atali ko ek chitthee likhi thi
 Accordingly, Nehru told Atlee, 'I have come to know from my trusted source that Kisubhash Chandra Bosejo is your war criminal, Stalin has approved his entry into the Russian border
 yah rus kaa dhokhaa he, kyonki rus british-american allins kaa samarthak he
 Russia should not have done this

 However, at the end of this letter, only the name of Nehru is written and there are no signatures

 It states, "there is little scope for doubt that he died in a plane crash on 18 August 1945 in Taihoku
 bharat sarkaar ne pehle hi is rukh ko sweekaar kar liya he
 There is no evidence to refute this
 'note main aage kaha gaya he, 'agar kuch vyakti, sanghathan alag raay rakhte hai to aisa lagata he ki ve kisi tarksangat soch kii bajaay bhaavnaatmak taur par adhik prerit hai
 Such people believe that Netaji is alive and not in contact with anyone and will come up when needed

 But Netflix is also being discussed with Cannes this year
 darasal netflix ko kans main shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 Or rather, according to the new terms of Cannes, Netflix is not eligible to be a part of Cannes
 lekin isi shart kii vajah se film jagat main vivaad uth khadaa hua he
 This is the reason for the dispute between Netflix and Cannes
 yah vivaad kans festival main laae gaye ek nae niyam ko lekar he, jisamen un movies par bain laga diya gaya he jo france main theatre par relies nahin hui
 During the premiere of Netflix's film 'okja' in the 2017 Cannes film, people from different countries resented the arrival of the Netflix logo on the screen
 darasal vahaan maujuud logon kaa tark tha ki is film festival main unheen filmon ko shaamil kiya janaa chahie jo theatre main relies hui hen
 Such films should be excluded from this festival which do not fulfill this condition
 dauraan netflix ke liye mili inhen pratikrayaon ke baad kans ne niyam banaaya ki is festival main vahi filmein hissaa lengi jo theatre main relies hui hon
 Netflix had two films at the Cannes Film Festival in 2017 - Boon Joon-ho's 'okja' and Noah Bombach's 'the Meyerowitz Stories'
 netfilks ne pehali baar is festival main hissaa liya tha
 But for the first time he had to go out after being criticized
 netflilkas ke content editor sarandos ne ‘vairieti’ ko bataaya ki "netflix film or siries theatre main relies nahin kii jaati, iske bajaay sidhe digital platform par dikhaai jaati hai
 This practice is contrary to the policy of the Council, hence they will not be a part of the Festival

 Poppelberg also said, 'I don't believe in films that are given token qualification in some theaters for less than a week, and they should qualify for Academy Award nominations
 ’ek film ek vichaar he, chaahe vah theatre par dikhaai jaae yaa digital platform par
 People are also ready to pay subscription charges due to the good content of Netflix
 filmi hastiyon ke liye kans festival kaa bada mahatv he
 Everyone's dream is to get respect in this

 Why should women handle all domestic chores themselves? In such a situation, a husband and wife should work wisely
 donon ko ek-duusare se sahyog karne ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 With a little understanding, unnecessary confrontation is averted, but mutual love also intensifies

 is film main olympic jaise kai bade khelon ke rang dekhne ko milenge
 The comments chunki film kii kahani ek pahalwaan par aadhaarit he, jisamen salmaan khan pahalwaan kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai isliye is film main 2010 main china main hue asian game, 2010 main bharat main hue kaamanwealth game, 2012 main landan main hue olympic or 2013 main hungary main hue raceling world championships kii jhalkiyaan dikhaai jaaengi

 The rays of hope have been clouded by circumstances
 aise mode par sirf kushal netritv hi niraashaa or aashaa ke bich kii daraar ko bhar saktaa he
 Given the diversity of India, its rulers have to take a wider view
 isaki yuva jansankhya ko vikaas ke liye saahasik drushtikon or isaki ek arab se zyada aabaadi ko sthayitv or nirantarata kii jarurat he
 So the first thing i want to say is that the question is not what i will do, or what any Prime Minister will do
 mahatvapurn yah he ki bharat ko kya chahie
 It may sound an idiom, but its challenges lie in India's challenges
 main kahana chaahunga ki isaki samasyaon main hi iske samaadhaan bhi hai or ve hi ise ek nai kaksha main prakshepit karenge
 We have to focus on our very silent population which has lagged behind
 ab jaraa ham apni sabase badi samasya par dhyaan den
 Income inequality and poverty
 hamaari do-tihaai se zyada aabaadi gramin arthvyavastha par nirbhar he or vah ek-chauthai raashtra aay par jinda hai agar ham aarthik vruddhi chaahate hai to is maun bahusankhyak aabaadi kii kray shakti ko badaye bina yah katai sambhav nahin he
 And the biggest step for this is to provide water
 keval 40 fisadi krishi bhoomi hi sinchit he or 60 fisadi kisaan monsoon kii krupa par ashrith hai
 We have to provide more and more water to the land to increase and sustain productivity
 hamen pani kii har boond kaa sadupyog karnaa hoga, baandhon, naharon or drip sinchai vyavastha jaisi pranali par nivesh karnaa hoga taaki hamaare kisaanon ko pani mil sake
 There is a concern about the scarcity of food grains in front of economies around the world
 bhumandaleey avasaron kaa laabh uthaakar ham apni arthvyavastha ko aage le ja sakate hai
 India, which last year supplied food grains to 18 countries, could become a food factory for the world
 isse gramin kray shakti badhegi, arthvyavastha main majbootee aegi, udyogikaran ko badhaava milegaa, vyapaar main teji aegi or antarrashtriya kaarobaar kaa kshetra badhegaa
 No country in the world has progressed without investment in infrastructure
 jaisaa ki main pehle hi kah chukaa hum, samasya main hi samaadhaan he
 Investment in infrastructure will increase demand in basic industries, increase employment opportunities and sustain growth
 sabake mili-jule prabhaav se vikaas ko bal milegaa or phir log krishi se hatakar kaarkaanon kii taraf jaaenge, jisase antat gramin arthvyavastha par nirbharta khatm hogi
 It is expected that India and neighboring China will lead the world in ending the recession and this belief is due to the young population
 50 fisadi aabaadi 20 varsh se kam hone se bharat ke paas apane or duniya ke liye kaaryashakti taiyaar karne kaa sunaharaa avasar he lekin pehle 10 saal hamen buniyadi shiksha, vyavsaayik shiksha or takneekee shiksha par dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 Investment in education will create jobs, accelerate growth and increase the number of earners
 tamaam raajnneetikon ke vipareet mujhe pratibha palaayan kaa dar nahin he
 Currently, the population of many countries is growing and it needs young manpower
 bharat is maukey kaa laabh uthaa saktaa he, kyonki iske paas kisi bhi vaataavaran main kaam karne ke liye sankhya or yogyata donon hai
 The Indian people should be able to hold top positions in institutions of every country, as the British and American people did earlier
 lekin suraksha ke bina vikaas ko barkaraar nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 India is situated next to a threatened neighbor
 ham apni bhugolic sthiti to badal nahin sakate, isliye main samajhataa hum ki hamaari suraksha kii taiyaari kii samiksha karnaa behad jaruri he
 We are ready for external danger
 lekin bharat ke saamne bahari or andruni khatra he
 For this, i will adopt a two-way solution
 pehla, aantarik suraksha vyavastha main sampurna pherbadal
 Second, we have to build partnerships and increase resources with neighbors on a long-term basis
 bharat ke saamne ek anya badi chunauti he sarkaar ko puri tarah durust karne kii
 For this, the needs of the poorest sections have to be fulfilled whether it is food, house or employment
 sarkaar ko garibi rekha se neeche jindagi bitaane vaale 30 karod pariwaron ko jivan-yaapan ke strot or swasthya kii suvidha uplabdh karaani chahie
 The top-down approach of development should change, where the capitals of Delhi and the state decide who will spend how much money
 isse baari badlaav aayega
 We have a lot of government control and government intervention but very little accountability
 niti ke str par bahut zyada niyantran se deree hoti he or bhrashtachar ko badhaava miltaa he
 On the other hand, there is a decline in service quality at the private level
 ise badalane ke liye janata or nijee kshetra kii bhagidaari badhaani chahie
 It is impossible to see every aspect of governance
 isliye maine mukhya muddon par najar daali he
 Make your assessment, focus on your needs and then find a solution

 With that, the hopes of 100 crores people will be raised sharad pavaar se 5 sawalbharat ko aarthik sankat se nikaalane ke liye kya karenge?uttar he, bahuaiami prabhaav paidaa karne ke liye nivesh, nivesh or nivesh
 We should prepare a list of 100 billion dollar rural and urban projects
 isamen sinchai, bijli, sadaken, bandargah, hawaii adde or nae audyogic kshetra bananaa shaamil he
 The country will have to reduce the population of its metros and i would like to start a plan to build 50 new cities across the country
 rashtriya suraksha main bharosa kaayam karne ke liye aap kya kadam uthaaenge?aantarik suraksha ko raajnneeti se alag rakhaa jayega
 Terrorism will be declared enemy number one of the country, whatever form it may be
 ranneeti ke str par bharat kii aantarik suraksha vyavastha ko maansikta or nivesh ke maamle main raksha vyavastha ke baraabar mahatv diya jayega
 i will announce a one-time budget on manpower and technology for intelligence gathering and counter-terrorism units across the country
 bharat main nyaay main deree hoti he or log nyaay se vanchit rah jate hai
 What will you do? i think we have been debating this subject for a long time
 malimat or duusari samitiyaan pehle hi tamaam salaah de chuki hai
 Within two sessions of the Parliament, its action plan will be made and implemented
 jarurat hui to vishesh sansadeey samiti se paraamarsh kiya ja saktaa he
 Governance is weakened by corruption and lack of accountability
 aap kya karenge?hamaare yahaan sarkaar kii dakhlandaji bahut zyada he or javabdehi bahut kam
 The answer lies in reform, outsourcing and technology promotion
 aaj hamaari yojanaayen upar se neeche kii ore hai or kharch ke faisle apaardarshee hote hai
 For good governance, we need to involve people, bring in transparent system and implement public audit
 raajnneeti kaa apradheekaran mahamari ban chukaa he
 How will we end this? For this we have to be ruthless
 ise taala nahin ja saktaa kyonki aam janata main ise lekar rosh bad rahaa he
 This will lift trust from democracy
 ham samaan vichaardhaara vaali partiyon ke saath milakar is samasya ko khatm kar sakate hai

 Officials from Nepal may face the problem of 'traffic jam' on Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, due to the increase in the number of climbers this season
 paryaton vibhaag ke anusaar may ke madhya main kareeb 400 parvatarohi 8,848 meter unchi mount everest kii apni yatra shuru kar sakate hai
 The Kathmandu Post stated that because the number of climbers with mountaineers (whose numbers are usually higher than climbers) the number of people going to the peak could be around a thousand
 isse lambii qatari lag sakati he or yatra main avrodh utpann ho sakate hai
 The expedition teams have started reaching the base camp a month before the start of the yatra
 parvatarohiyon ke saath sahyogi ke rup main paanch baar mount everest par ja chuke sonam sherpa ne kaha ki mausam ke saaf hote hi har kisi ko chotii par jane kii jaldbaaji hogi
 There is no management to decide the turn of climbers
 unhone kaha ki isliye vahaan trephic jam kii sambhaavna he
 While returning, climbers usually have low oxygen reserves and face trouble
 tippaniyan In 2015, the government introduced a new law for mountaineers under which it had imposed a 3-year limit for climbing Mount Everest
 paryaton vibhaag ke soochna adhikari durgaadatta dhakal ne kaha, 'teen saal kii avadhi kaa yah aakhri saal he or jinhen pehle anumati mili thi, ve is baar mauka ganvaana nahin chahenge

 There was a fierce struggle between the gods and the demons to get the nectar

 Since one day of the gods is considered equal to one year of humans, this war lasted for twelve years

 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne khulaasa kiya he ki philhal team ke dressing room main sab kuch sahi nahin he
 He said the 'communication gap' led to 'differences' when Virat Kohli was sent to start the day's play, after which the Indian innings collapsed and the team suffered a defeat in the second Test at the hands of Australia
 bharat ne duusari pari main 224 ran par out hone ke baad australia ko sirf 128 ran kaa lakshya diya or phir match chaar wicket se ganvaa diya
 The upheaval in dressing form was caused by a hand injury during Friday's unbeaten batsman Shikhar Dhawan's practice session
 is ballebaaj ne haalanki din ke khel kii shuruyaat se thik pehle chot ko lekar asahajata jataai
 India then sent Kohli to bat, but the batsman was informed of the change when there was less than seven minutes left at the start of the game
 dhoni ne puraskaar vitaran samaaroh ke dauraan kaha, aaj pehla satr hamaare liye bada jhatka lekar aayaa
 There was a lack of communication in our dressing form about whether Shikhar would go for batting or Virat
 ham is sthiti se acchhee tarah nahin nipate
 Dhoni said, we were batting on the net
 wicket kaaphi acha nahin tha or shikhar ko chot lagi
 He did not react badly enough at the time, so we thought he would be right to bat
 lekin jab vah dressing room main aayaa, to use kaaphi dard ho rahaa tha or vah ballebaaji karne main sakasham nahin tha
 We were able to give Virat only five to seven minutes to prepare and this created a somewhat uncomfortable situation in the dressing room

 Akhilesh Yadav, who has become the 'sultan' of Uttar Pradesh from Tipu, was born on July 1, 1973 in Saifai, Etawah and in this way he has completed his journey of 46 years of life
 mulaayam singh yadav kii raajnneetik viraasat ko sambhaal rahe akhilesh yadav 27 saal kii umr main saansad bane or 38 saal main desh ke sabase bade soobe uttar pradesh ke sabase kam umr ke mukhyamantri banane kaa itihaas rachaa
 However, Akhilesh is constantly losing his father's political legacy
 yahi vajah he ki sapa apane itihaas ke sabase mushkil daur se guzar rahi he, aise main sawaal he ki akhilesh party ko dobaaraa se vaapasi kara paaenge?siyaasi maahaul main paley-bade akhilesh ne saal 2000 main kannauj loksabhaa up chunaav ko jitkar raajnneetik pari kaa aagaaj kiya
 He defeated his nearest rival bsp's Akbar Ahmed Dumpy by nearly 58 thousand votes
 iske baad akhilesh 2004 or 2009 main lagaataar is seat par vijayi hue, lekin 2009 main kannauj ke alaava firozabad sansadeey seat se bhi jeet darj kii thi
 After this he has resigned from Firozabad parliamentary seat
 2012 main bane upi ke mukhyamantri2012 ke uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main akhilesh yadav ne puure pradesh kii yatra kii
 The result was that the SP returned to power with an absolute majority
 jiske baad mulaayam singh yadav ne bada faisla lete hue akhilesh yadav ko mukhyamantri banane kaa faisla kiya
 Thus, at the age of 38, Akhilesh became the 33rd Chief Minister of UP
 soobe main sabase kam umr main mukhyamantri banane kaa record unke naam darj he
 However, since then, the graph of SP has gone down
 akhilesh yadav ne mukhyamantri rahete hue upi main metro pariyojnaayen sanchaalan karne, lakhanu-agra express ve jaisi infrastracchar aadhaarit project ke saath-saath yuvaaon ko laptop va garib mahilaon ko pension die jane kii yojanaayen shuru kin
 He laid the foundation for the 'four Lane Road' as well as the Purvanchal Expressway project, but could not be completed as the government moved
 raajnneetik chunautiyon main fail ho rahe akhiledkhilesh yadav khud ko desh kaa samaajawaadee netaa ke saath kisaan, ejeeniyar, paryaavarnavid va saamaajik kaaryakarta bhi bataate hai
 Ever since Akhilesh Yadav has got the sp's command, the party has been constantly facing defeat
 akhilesh ne jitne bhi raajnneetik prayog kiye, sabhi fail rahe hai
 The SP first suffered a crushing defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 modi lahar main sapa ke sabhi diggaj haar gaye
 Nobody could win except a member of 'mulayam Kunbe'
 sapa ko sirf paanch siten mili
 Ahead of the 2017 assembly elections, there was a battle of supremacy between Shivpal Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav over a soft political legacy
 isamen akhilesh sab par baari pade or party kii kaman apane haathon main le lee
 After this, Akhilesh Yadav entered the electoral fray in alliance with the Congress, but this experiment could not succeed and the SP lost badly
 sapa ko mahaj 46 siten mili
 After this, Akhilesh Yadav decided to form an alliance with Mayawati's party BSP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections without Mulayam's will
 akhilesh yadav ne mayawati ke saath soobe bhar main sanyukt reliyaan kii, lekin is prayog main bhi sapa ko vah jita nahin sake
 SP suffered a crushing defeat in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and the party got just five seats
 yahi nahin akhilesh yadav kii patni dimple yadav ko kannauj, bhai dharmendra yadav ko badaayun or akshay yadav ko firozabad main haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa he
 The defeat has shaken both Akhilesh Yadav and his party inside
 duusari ore, mayawati ne haar kaa sara thikra akhilesh yadav or unke vot bank yadav samudaay par phodte hue gathbandhan tod diya
 The SP is going through the worst phase in its political history
 loksabhaa chunaav main haar ke baad se sapa main bade badlaav ke sanket mil rahe hai, lekin akhilesh yadav ke videsh main hone se abhi tak sanghathan main koi pher badal nahin ho sakaa he
 In such a question, how will Akhilesh Yadav get the SP back? For latest update on mobile SMS <news> to 52424 for Airtel, Vodafone and idea users

 The Aam Aadmi Party has started demonstrations on corruption charges against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 aam aadmi party ke kaaryakartaaon ne buudhvaar ko bijepi pradesh adhyaksh or saansad manoj tiwari ke ghar ke baahar pradarshan kiya
 Activists say that Manoj Tiwari should prove the allegations, otherwise apologize
 gauratlab he ki manoj tiwari ne dilli kii aam aadmi party sarkaar par aarope lagaatha or kaha tha ki shiksha ke naam par kejariwal sarkaar ne 2000 karod rupye kaa ghotaalaa kiya he
 Tiwari had made a big charge against Manish Sisodia and said that now Manish Sisodia should resign immediately
 tiwari ne kaha ki sarkaar kahati he ki shiksha main bada kaam kiya he lekin shiksha ke naam par 2000 karod kaa ghotaalaa kiya he
 Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi Manish Sisodia on Sunday, BJP Executive President J
 pi
 Challenging Nadda to compare ten government schools running under bjp's education model with Kejriwal government schools
 sisodiya ne kaha, "main nadda ko chunauti detaa hum ki ve bijepi shiksha model ke tahat kaam kar rahe das sarkari skulon kii tulana kejariwal ke shiksha model se karen
 "his statement comes a day after Nadda's statement that the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi has become a laughing stock
 sisodiya ne kaha, "nadda ne kaha ki aap hansi kaa paatr ban kar rah gai he
 This working president of BJP is ridiculing the people of Delhi in a way
 vah kah rahe hai ki dilli ke log hansi ke paatr hai
 "sisodia reminded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said in the Lok Sabha that making fun of elected governments is to make fun of the country and the mandate
 unhone kaha, "lagata he, nadda kaa najariya pradhanmantri se alag he
 " dinaankah 25-06-2013shrimati shila dikshit ji,aapke raajnneetik sachiv, shri pawan kheda ke dwaara likhaa patr mujhe praapt hua
 In this you have raised some issues which i am answering through this letter, but i am confused why you did not write this letter directly to me, why did you write it in the name of your staff? Just a few months ago you did the same
 ek jansabha main maine kaha tha ki aap bijli companiyon kii dallali kar raheen hai
 You probably felt that bad
 tab bhi aapane sidhe mere khilaaf manahani kaa cese karne kii bajaay shri pawan kheda ji ke naam se mere khilaaf cese karaayaa tha
 There is a saying in English-
 a leader should lead from the front
 Working in hiding behind someone or running a gun on someone else's shoulder shows the weakness of a leader
 aapane apane patra main likhaa he ki abhi tak dilli kii raajnneeti bahut svachh thi or maine isko ganda kar diya
 You feel this because till now there was no one to oppose you in Delhi
 dilli main koi vipakshi party thi hi nahin
 The match between the BJP and the Congress was puffing
 dilli kii raajnneeti ko bhaajapa or congress ne saajha bijness bana liya tha
 Both the BJP and the Congress are joined by the electricity and water companies
 aap bijli or pani ke daam badhaati raheen or bhaajapa kabhi kabhaar ek ghante yaa ek din kaa sadak par pradarshan karne kaa naatak karti rahi
 The public was plundered, crushed, groaning
 par aap donon partiyon ke liye sab kuch acha chal rahaa tha
 Both parties were happy
 ab achaanak aam aadmi party ne aakar aap donon partiyon kaa raita failaa diya
 Here you are sad, you are saying that we have made Delhi's politics dirty
 udhar bhaajapa dukhi he
 She is also saying that we have made Delhi's politics dirty
 par dilli kaa aam aadmi bahut khush ho gaya he
 The common man of Delhi has got an honest choice for the first time
 agar aap vaaki ‘svachh raajnneeti’ karnaa chaahati hai to aap ko turant nimnlikhit kadam uthaane chahie-1
 Today, there are 16 Congress mlas in Delhi Vidhan Sabha who are facing trial for serious crime
 aise log vidhansabha main baithkar balaatkaar, hatya or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf kanoon kaise bana sakate hai? vidhansabha ek mandir he
 The presence of such people makes this temple impure
 aam aadmi party ne elaan kiya he ki aane vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main ek bhi aapraadhik chhavi ke vyakti ko tikat nahin diya jayega
 If you really want to make Delhi's politics clean, then you should declare that the Congress will not give tickets to anyone with any criminal image in the coming elections
 2
 The donations received by political parties should be transparent
 aam aadmi party apane saare daan daataaon kii suchi website par daalati he
 According to reports, the Congress party received donations of more than two thousand crore rupees in the last five years
 lekin congress party daandaataaon kii suchi nahin bataa rahi
 It is believed that many companies involved in the coal scam have also donated to the Congress
 par yah to tab pataa chalegaa jab aap yah list saarvajanik karengi
 If you put this list on the website, then there will be confidence in the minds of people that you really want to do 'clean politics'
 3
 Today, dynasty has engulfed the politics of our country
 ek hi parivaar ke kai-kai logon ko tikat mil jaataa he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has announced that it will not give tickets to two people from one family
 meraa aap se nivedan he ki yadi aap vaaki ‘svachh raajnneeti’ chaahati hai to aapako elaan karnaa chahie ki congress party bhi ek hi parivaar se ek se zyada logon ko tikat nahin degi
 i know that if you make such a declaration, you will have to make a huge sacrifice - either you or your son Mr
 Sandeep Dixit ji, one of the two will have to take up politics
 yadi aap upar likhe teenon kadam uthaati hai to logon ko vishwaas hoga ki aap vaaki ‘svachh raajnneeti’ karnaa chaahati hai
 You have written in your letter that we have abused you in our auto campaign
 main yah nahin maanata
 Tell yourself which word i did not like? i definitely believe that i have said in many places that you are doing brokerage for power companies
 par kya maine galat kaha? kyonki aapane dilli main bijli ke daam anaap-shanaap badha die hai
 This is making huge profits for the power companies of Tata and Ambani, but their money is so high that despite having such huge profits, they messed up their accounts and showed a loss of Rs 20,000 crore
 prashn uthta he ki agar vaaki itnaa baari ghaataa hua he to tata or ambani ne ye bijness band kyun nahin kar diya? yah baat to aap maanengi ki tata or ambani dilli main samaaj seva karne nahin aae, paisa kamaane aae hai
 Has the Ambani brothers made a single loss deal in their lives till date? As soon as the losses started in Delhi Airport Metro line, Ambani left the business and fled
 to phir 20,000 karod kaa ghaataa hone ke baavjood wo yahaan kyon tike hue hai? kuch naa kuch gadabad to he
 All the people of Delhi are saying that these companies should be audited
 lekin bina audit karaae aap baar-baar bijli ke daam badhaati ja rahi hai
 You say that you are ready to conduct an audit, but these electricity companies are not agreeing
 aap kaa yah tark gale nahin utarataa
 Are you the chief minister or the power companies? After all, why our Chief Minister is helpless and helpless in front of the power companies? If the power companies are not ready to conduct an audit then why don't you cancel their license? Coming here, the question arises in the mind of the public whether Sheila Dixit ji is doing brokerage of electricity companies? As soon as the power companies said that they have incurred a loss of 20,000 crores, you immediately run to the central government and ask for financial package from the center to save Anil Ambani
 lekin jab dilli kii janata bade hue bijli ke bilon kii vajah se karaah uthati he to aap kahati hai ki cooler istemaal karnaa band kar do, tii
 V
 istemaal karnaa band kar do, frij istemaal karnaa band kar do
 Because of these statements and deeds, people have become convinced that there is a nexus with your power companies
 aadhi se zyada dilli ke logon ke gharon main pani nahin aa rahaa
 You are the Chief Minister for the last 15 years
 15 varshon main aap logon ke gharon tak pani nahin pahunchaa pai
 In spite of this, your government is planting advertisements in Delhi by spending crores of rupees
 or dilli main vikaas hone kaa daawa kar rahi he
 How development Whose development If the crores of rupees spent on these advertisements were spent on water, then perhaps the water would have reached the people of some houses
 aap khud nai dilli vidhansabha kii vidhayika hai jahaan pradhanmantri, raashtrapati, sabhi mantri ityadi rahete hai
 The biggest irony is that in your own assembly, there is no water in people's homes
 aapaki vidhansabha main ek DIZ aria he
 It is 3 km from Rashtrapati Bhavan
 me
 Is at a distance of
 yahaan bhi logon ke gharon main pine kaa pani nahin aata
 People here bring drinking water from the park
 roj subah parkon main logon kii pani bharne ke liye line lagati he or log baltiyaan bhar-bhar ke chauthi manzil tak lekar jate hai
 This is the story of more than half of Delhi
 jaise puraane jamaane main mahilaayein kuen se dhokar pani laayaa karti thi
