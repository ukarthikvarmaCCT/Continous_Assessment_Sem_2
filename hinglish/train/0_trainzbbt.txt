 During the hearing on Tuesday, senior lawyers Abad Ponda and Abhinav Chandrachud presented their arguments on behalf of the journalists
 aabaad ponda ne apni jirah main kaha ki nichali adaalat ko ye adhikaar nahin he ki wo media reporting par pabandi laga sake jab tak ki maamla in- camera naa suna ja rahaa ho
 There is nothing like this in Soharabuddin fake encounter case, then the court has banned media reporting but there is no restriction on going to court during the hearing

 Shalini has also shared this picture with her Twitter handle
 shalini se mulaakaat ke baad tej bahadur yadav ne kaha ki vah paanch bhai hai, lekin koi bahan nahin thi
 She now got a sister in the form of Shalini Yadav
 nakli chaukeedaar ke khilaaf asli chaukeedaar kii ladaai jari rahegi
 Tej Bahadur said that i will bet on life for Shalini's victory
 namakan radd hone ke baad shalini yadav ne kaha ki ab main shalini kii ladaai ko aage badhaane or modi ji ko haraane ke liye banaras main hi rah kar door tu door prachaar karuunga
 On this meeting, Shalini Yadav said that today we have come to meet Tej Bahadur Ji

 Shalini's father-in-law Shyam Lal Yadav has been a stalwart of the Congress, who was never directly concerned with the Gandhi family, not just the Congress
 isi ke chalate congress ne shalini yadav ko varanasi seat se 2017 main meyar kaa tikat diya tha
 Shalini may have lost to bjp's Mridula Jaiswal, but managed to garner one lakh fourteen thousand votes
 iske baad se lagaataar wo party main sakriy raheen
 In the Lok Sabha elections, Shalini had sought a ticket from the Congress
 tikat na milane ke baad unhone congress chhodkar sapa kaa daaman tham liya he
 The SP first made him his candidate, but on one occasion, he cut the ticket and gave it to Tej Bahadur Yadav
 haalanki, tikat kaate jane se pehle shalini yadav namakan kar chuki thim
 Due to this, when the form of Tej Bahadur Yadav was canceled, the SP has once again made Shalini Yadav its candidate

 Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, Vijender Gupta, on Sunday said that writing Kejriwal's letter on the issue of sealing is just a show off
 vah sirf naatak kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 Let us know that by writing a letter on the issue of sealing, Chief Minister Kejriwal has invited Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari to his residence on Tuesday
 magar dilli bijepi kii taraf se sthiti saaf nahin hui he ki aakhir dilli bijepi ke netaa kejariwal ke ghar jaaenge yaa nahin

 jammu-kashmir kii raajnneeti ke pramukh chehron main shumaar congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad satta main hon yaa vipaksh main, har samay apni praasangikta banaae rakhte hai
 Ghulam Nabi Azad, born in a small village in Jammu and Kashmir, made deep inroads into the 'delhi Durbar' with his political acumen in the innings of nearly 5 decades
 centre main ab tak kai ahm padon par kaam kar chuke aaazaad jammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantri bhi rah chuke hai
 Ghulam Nabi Azad, who has maintained his importance in the 'delhi Durbar' for nearly five decades, is one of the leaders close to UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi
 70 saal ke gulam nabi aaazaad raajnneeti ke puraane pandit hai
 His experience working with Indira Gandhi to Rahul Gandhi ranks him among the frontline leaders of the Congress
 har daur main gulam nabi aaazaad ne ‘dilli darbar’ main apni ahmiyat banaae rakhi
 Ghulam Nabi Azad does not have any major responsibility these days after the change of power in the Congress in charge of Uttar Pradesh
 uttar pradesh ke prabharee kii jimmedaari priyanka gandhi wadra or jyotiraditya sindhiya ke paas chale jane se ab unke paas party main koi badi jimmedaari nahin he
 With no major role in the politics of the Center, it is now believed that Ghulam Nabi Azad can once again turn to the state
 isse pehle bhi jab nai dilli main apane liye koi badi bhoomika na milte dekh aaazaad ne jammu-kashmir main hi rahanaa munasib samajha tha
 The Chief Minister of J&K, although after holding such a large rank at the center, it will not be easy for Azad to return to the state
 rajya main loksabhaa chunaav ke saath hi kuch dinon ke bheetar vidhansabha chunaav bhi hone hai
 Ghulam Nabi Azad, taking advantage of his experience, can again become a big face of Congress in the state
 saal 2002 main bhi aaazaad centre se rajya kaa rukh karte hue jammu-kashmir main badi bhoomika main najar aae the
 The party contested the assembly elections under Azad's leadership, rejuvenating the Congress
 2002 ke chunaav main congress ne pidipi ke saath gathbandhan karte hue jammu-kashmir main 3 plus 3 ke formule par sarkaar banaai thi
 Under this formula, in the first three years, the head of the PDP, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, sat on the chair of the CM and then Ghulam Nabi Azad became the Chief Minister for the next three years
 jeendke kii raajnneeti main rakhte hai bada ‘dakhal’gulam nabi aaazaad ne dilli main rahane ke baad bhi jammu-kashmir kii siyasat par kabhi apni pakad dhili nahin padane di
 Despite all the controversies, Ghulam Nabi Azad continues to be the biggest face of the Congress in Jammu and Kashmir
 haalanki iske peeche ye bhi kaha jaataa he ki gulam nabi aaazaad dilli main baithkar bhi rajya kii raajnneeti main lagaataar ‘dakhal’ dete rahe hai
 Due to this, no major leader of Congress could flourish in Jammu and Kashmir in the last several years
 rajya main apni praasangikta banaae rakhane rahane ke chalate hi dilli main bhi unhen lagaataar tavajjo milti rahi he
 Ghulam Nabi Azad contested the first Lok Sabha election from Maharashtra in 1980 and won the Washim parliamentary seat of Maharashtra in the seventh Lok Sabha election in 1980
 iske baad 1984 main bhi ve isi seat se kaamyaab hue
 After this, Azad reached Rajya Sabha from Maharashtra from 1990 to 96
 iske baad ve phir jammu-kashmir se 1996 se 2002 tak rajyasabha saansad rahe
 In 2002, he was again sent to Rajya Sabha from J&K quota, but resigned from Rajya Sabha on 29 April 2006 after being crowned as the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir on 30 November 2005
 2008 main amarnath yatra ke liye jameen vivaad ke chalate unhone siem pad se istipha de diya
 After this, in the Manmohan government in UPA-2, Azad has also been the health minister of the country
 2014 main modi sarkaar aane par congress ne unhen rajyasabha main netaa vipaksh banaaya
 In 2015, Azad again reached the Rajya Sabha from Jammu and Kashmir

 vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha ki airstrike ke baad pakistan kaaphi alag-thalag hua he
 Pakistan is exposed to the world
 pakistan ke liye yah aasaan tha ki airstrike kii maar khaae or use chupa jaae, kyonki agar vah duniya ke saamne sweekaar kar letaa to use isaki baari keemat chukaani padati
 Jaitley said this while addressing a special 'security gathering' organized by Aaj Tak
 unhone kaha, 'pakistan ke liye airstrike kii isse badi keemat kya hogi ki china or turki jaise desh tatasth hai
 Organization of Islamic countries OIC is not listening to you
 ' unhone kaha, 'jab hamane strike kiya to hamane duniya ko bataaya nahin, duniya ko pehali soochna subah 4

 It is clear that the army is being run by the government there, the Pakistan Army, which had made its aura in some countries that the border of Pakistan is very strong, but the truth of these events would have destroyed their aura, if they had accepted that In a surgical strike, Indian troops entered their house and destroyed the hideouts of the terrorists
 airstrike main videshi vimaan unke ghar main ghuskar karrwai kii or ve kuch nahin kar paae to unka aura kya rahata
 'pakistan would be surrounded by the world,' he said, 'if Pakistan had accepted that this incident had happened, then the international community would ask a lot of questions, where did it happen? What was happening there? Who were the dead? What would they answer? It was not a camp running in tents inside the forest
 ye to army, military jaise institutional camp the
 We knew it all through satellite
 ve duniya ko kya bataate ki hamaare yahaan jaish ke camp chal rahe the or bharat kii fouj ai or usne air missile hamale se ise nasht kar diya
 So the United Nations Security Council would have banned it, its FATF would have also banned it
 to pakistan ke liye maar khaanaa or use chupa janaa zyada aasaan tha or yah sweekaar kar lete to uski inhen badi keemat chukaani padati
 India is a powerful country in the world

 Terrorists used to get encouragement in Bangladesh, today it has become our friendly country
 maldive ke saath bhi paristhiti badali he
 This has marked a turning point in our relations with Pakistan
 haalanki, pakistan ne kabhi yah sweekaar nahin kiya ki kashmir bharat kaa abhinn hissaa he
 Kashmir is an unfinished agenda of Pakistan in 1947
 They tried in 1947, 1965, 1971 and 1999, but when they were left behind in the traditional war, they changed their ways and one of these non-traditional methods was to send terrorism from across the border

 maine sardaar patel ke bare main kaaphi jaankaree lee thi
 In such a situation, the son of a Brahmin knows as much as the son of a Patel would not know
 paresh ravalne kaha ki abhi main jo kehane ja rahaa hum vah un logon ke liye he jo sardaar patel ko apamaanit karte hai
 Let me tell you that the Congressmen have not kept any shortcoming in humiliating Patle
 anyaay karne main kuch bhi kami nahin rakhi he

 paresh rawal ne aage kaha ki patel ne desh ko ek kiya tha

 patel ke bare main zyada nahin likhaa gaya, jabaki jearady tata ne bhi kaha tha ki sardaar patel apane prime ministar hote to desh kahaan kaa kahaan pahunch gaya hota
 Rawal further said that those who insult Sardar Patel do not have the banner of Sardar Patel
 usee congress ne sardaar patel kii mrityu ke 30 saal baad unhen bharat ratna diya, jabaki rajeev gandhi kii maut ke turant baad de diya
 The protest started with the controversial statement of MP Paresh Rawal, the Kshatriya community of Rajkot came out in protest

 Paresh further said that such words will never come out of our mouth for such people and for such community
 mujhe itnaa hi kahana he, uske baavjood bhi kisi ke dil ko thes pahunchi he to main dilgir hum

 hindustani awam morcha kaa akele chunaav ladane kaa elaan mahagathbandhan ke liye jhatkamanjhi kii party ne mahagathbandhan ke saath milakar ladaa tha loksabhaa chunaav, mili thi harabihar ke purv mukhyamantri or hindustani awam morcha ke rashtriya adhyaksh jithan ram maanjhi shuukravaar ko mahagathbandhan or endie ke netaaon par jamkar barase
 He alleged that these two alliances have always cheated him
 is dauraan maanjhi ne yah bhi elaan kiya ki agle saal bihar main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main unki party akele apane dam par maidan main utregi
 Actually, Jeetan Ram Manjhi is busy expanding his party ahead of next year's assembly elections in Bihar
 isi kadi main shuukravaar ko unhone patna main party ke sadsyta abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Jeetan Ram Manjhi's party Hindustani Awam Morcha, along with the Grand Alliance, contested 3 seats
 haalanki unhen ek bhi seat par jeet nahin mili
 Jeetan Ram Manjhi's displeasure with the RJD and Congress in the Grand Alliance was well known at the time of seat sharing
 unhone 5 seat par chunaav ladane kaa daawa thoka tha, magar unki party ko sirf 3 siten hi di gayi
 After Manjhi's declaration of fighting alone in the 2020 assembly elections, it has become clear that in Bihar, the Grand Alliance is once again facing a cloud of crisis
 saal 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mahagathbandhan ne bihar kii 40 siton par apane pratyaashee utaare the
 In this, he won only one seat
 aise main agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav se pehle jithan ram maanjhi kaa akele chunaav ladane kaa elaan mahagathbandhan ke liye ek bada jhatka he
 The Grand Alliance was yet to recover from the shock of the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections and Manjhi gave it another blow
 maanjhi ne aarope lagaaya ki unhen mahagathbandhan ke saath hi endie ne bhi thaga he
 Manjhi joined the NDA during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, but shortly after he left the NDA and joined the Grand Alliance

 Lok Janshakti Party leader Chirag Paswan has said that Narendra Modi is not a communal leader
 ajtak ke kaarykram sidhi baat main unhone modi kii tarafdaari karte hue kaha ki ve vikaas kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 Chirag Paswan said, 'the fact is that alliances with NDA became our compulsion
 yah gathjod sirf majaburi hi nahin, hamaari party kii majbootee bhi sabit hogi, kyonki hamane upie main bane rahane kii bahut koshish kii
 Met Soniaji twice
 rahul gandhi to hamase mili tak nahin
 After this, we needed a strong alternative, which showed us in the BJP '
 is sawaal par ki rajnatik siddhanton ke aage majaburi kisi, chiraag paswan ne kaha, 'endie se judane ke liye hamane siddhanton se samjhauta nahin kiya he
 This alliance of ours is entirely based on issues
 12 saal pehle bhi jab ham endie kaa hissaa the, us vaqt bhi ham apane usulon par kaayam rahe
 When asked whether the alliance with the NDA was not an opportunity for the Congress not to give preference, Chirag Paswan said, "this is not a chance at all
" lok janashakti party ke tamaam varisht netaaon ko laga ki congress hamaari party ko nazarandaaj karke hamaara apmaan kar rahi he
 Only then did we choose BJP as a strong alternative
 'is sawaal par ki ramvilas paswan bijepi ko hameshaa ek dangai party maanate rahe hai, lekin satta kii laalach main ramvilas paswan bijepi se ja mili hai, chiraag paswan ne kaha, 'satta ke liye nahin, balki muddon ke aadhaar par ye gathjod hua he
 Even after joining the NDA, we have not left issues such as issues related to Dalits, minorities, granting special state status to Bihar and youth commission
 hamaare ye tamaam mudde kaaman minimum program ke tahat endie ke menifesto main shaamil kiye jaaenge
 "statements are based on circumstances", when asked if Lok Janshakti Party President Ram Vilas Paswan called BJP 'bharat Burn Party', sometimes it said that under the pressure of RSS, BJP has given Narendra Modi the Prime Minister's post
 Made a candidate
 bijepi ke saath gathjod karke kya unki party siddhanton ko taaq par nahin rakh rahi he, iske jawaab main chiraag paswan ne kaha, 'bayaan hameshaa paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par die jate hai
 Statements can also change if circumstances change
 rahi baat siddhanton kii, to agar ham usulon se samjhauta karte, to 2002 main dangon ke baad endie se naata na todate or na hi 2005 main bihar main sarkaar banane se chookte, kyonki us vakt hamaari maang thi ki bihar kaa mukhyamantri koi alpsankhyak ho
 "chirag Paswan said," We wanted to remain with the UPA until the Supreme Court gave a clean chit to Narendra Modi in the Gujarat riots case
 lekin congress hamaari party ko koi ahmiyat nahin de rahi thi
 Sometimes the Congress used to say that it would contest from all the forty Lok Sabha seats in Bihar, sometimes it was saying that it would give two or three seats to the Lok Janshakti Party in Bihar
 yah hamaara apmaan tha
 Modi is a communal or a secular leader, Paswan considers Narendra Modi a communal or a secular
 In response, he said that Modi is currently doing politics of development, not communal
 isse badi secular baat kya ho sakati he ki bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh ne musalamaanon se maafi bhi maangi he
 When Chirag Paswan was reminded that his party president had demanded Modi's resignation in 2002, Chirag Paswan said in response that what happened in 2002 was very bad, but we have to move with time Will have to move forward
 is sawaal par ki kya chiraag paswan narendra modi se prabhavit hai, chiraag ne kaha, 'puure desh kaa yuva modi se prabhavit he, kyonki modi sirf or sirf vikaas kii baaten kar rahe hai

 The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has given a big order on Thursday regarding the ongoing hookah bar in the capital Delhi
 court ne dilli main hukka baar ko band karaane ke liye lagaai gai yachika ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki hukka baar ko engiti act ke antargat pradooshan failaane vaale karkon main shaamil nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki isse paryaavaran main pradooshan nahin failata balki yah band kamare main kii jane vaali cheez he
 Although the Delhi government had closed several hookah bars last year, but still hundreds of hookah bars are still operating in Delhi
 aise hukka baar ke liye court kii ore se aayaa yah faisla behad raahat bharaa he
 After the dismissal of this petition and the non-inclusion of hookah in the NGT Act by the NGT, it will be extremely difficult to close the present hookah bar in the capital in the name of pollution
 engiti ne haalanki yachika khaarij karte hue paryaavaran or van mantralay ko yah nirdesh bhi diya ki vah indoor air paalution ke sandarbh main hukka ke prabhaavon kii jaanch kare or is mudde par uchit maanak nirdhaarit kare yani hukka baar aaj engiti act main bhale hi shaamil na ho lekin bhavishya main jaanch report ke aadhaar par isamen parivartan kiya ja saktaa he
 The NGT also said that it is not within its jurisdiction to stop the use of hookah in restaurants and bars in the city
 iske alaava engiti ne yah bhi kaha ki paryaavaran evam van mantralay ko court yah bhi salaah dena chahega ki vah gharelu vaayu pradooshan ke sandarbh main hukka ke prabhaavon par vichaar kare
 In October 2017, BJP Akali leader and MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa petitioned the NGT that hookah bars in the national capital should be immediately banned in view of the increasing pollution in Delhi
 is yachika main kareeb 20 bade hukka baar ko party banaaya gaya tha
 The trend of hookah bars in Delhi NCR first started in the restaurants of Gurugram, but after it became popular in Delhi, a large number of hookah bars opened like mushrooms
 is yachika main mukhya rup se kaha gaya tha ki jo log hukka pine aate hai, unke kaaran restaraan main maujuud logon ko bevajaah pasive smoking kerani padati he or hukke ke dhuen se unke swasthya par bura asar padataa he

 donald trump ko in dinon uttar korea kii mixilon or parmaanu bam kii phikr sata rahi he
 But just one blow of electronic waves from Pyongyang's satellite into space can strike the whole of America in darkness
 ab america raksha vibhaag is khatre se nipatane kii taiyaari main laga he
 There will be no voice in this catastrophe! According to US defense experts, North Korea has the power to conduct an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack on the US power grid from a satellite
 siie ke purv diarector james woolsi ke mutabik, ' is tarah kaa iklauta hamalaa bhi america ke electric grid or duusare buniyadi dhaanche ko saal bhar ke liye bekaar kar saktaa he
 Starvation and anarchy resulting from it will kill 9 out of 10 Americans
 'kya he america kii taiyaari?woolsi aagaah karte hai ki america sabhyataa or lakhon logon kii jaan bachaane ke liye america ko is ashanka se nipatane ke upaay khojane honge
 According to US media, the US Department of Defense is not unaware of this threat
 pentagon ke takneekee wing dephence advanced research project agency (diearpie) aise hamale se nipatane ke liye nai takanic viksit karne par kaam kar rahaa he
 The development of this technology is also included in President Trump's agenda of modernization of infrastructure
 diearpie ne power company biei system se aisa byaap taiyaar karne ke liye kaha he jo electric grid ke niskriy hone par bhi bijli kii supplai ko jari rakh sake
 But it may take up to 2020 for this technology to become a reality
 uttari korea se badhati kashidagirashtrapati trump ne satta sanbhaalane se pehle hi saaf kiya tha ki uttar korea ke hathiyaar kaarykram se nipatna unki praathamikta hogi
 Tensions have increased in both countries since his arrival at the White House
 trump prashasan ne saaf kiya he ki uttar korea ke khilaaf sabhi vikalp khule hai
 Despite this, on Sunday, North Korea tried unsuccessfully for the missile test
 abhi pichley kuch saalon tak kheton main khaali padi jameen ko bharne or mahaj pashuon ke khaane tak ke liye simit maani jane vaali ek fasal tamaam paridrishy ko is kadar badal degi, shaayad hi kisi ne sochaa tha
 These days, mandis are waiting for the arrival of guar and farmers are not ready to sell even at the risk of falling prices
 kheton main bane gharon ke kamaron se keemtee saamaan kii petiyaan nikaalkar khule main rakh di gai hai or khaali hue kamaron main guar bharkar taale lagaae gaye hai
 Gurpreet Singh Dhillon of Village 2FFA in Srikaranpur tehsil says, "even as the price last year was Rs
 32,000
 quintal na pahunche, par 20,000 ru
 i will not sell my guar at any rate below
 '' yahi farkaaya he, jo khaskar guar vyapaariyon ko chintaa main daale hue he
 Last year, most farmers raised their guar to Rs 4,500
 se lekar 7,000 ru
 Sold for up to a quintal
 vyapaariyon ke paas pahunchate hi bhaavon ne record tode to kisaan hakkaa-bakka rah gaye
 After seeing all this, farmers are no longer in any hurry
 ek saal pehle ke bhaavon ko dekhakar is baar kisaanon ne guar kii jamkar buaai kii
 Even the farmers of this region, who have the identity of cotton belt, have no hesitation in pushing cotton down from guar in order of priority
 krishi vipanan mahakme ke aankadon ke mutabik, ganganagar jile main saal 2011 main mahaj ek lakh hectare main guar kii buaai hui thi, jo 2012 main badhkar lagbhag dugani yani 1
 Turned to 96 lakh hectares
 jaahir he, buaai zyada Þi he to paidaavaar bhi zyada hogi hi
 The figures also point to this
 2010 main saat lakh quintal se zyada paidaavaar hui thi, jo 2011 main badhkar aath lakh quintal tak pahunch gai
 Guar is estimated to produce up to 24 lakh quintals in 2012
 koi or fasal hoti to in dinon mandiyon main pair rakhane kii jagah nahin hoti, lekin yah guar he, jo zyaadaatar kisaanon ke kothon main hi padaa hua he, or ve ise philhal baahar nikaalane ke mood main dikhaai nahin dete
 There has been a situation of unease, which was not possible to think about till a few years ago
 pichley saal ke bhav kisaanon ko vah raah dikhaa rahe hai, jise pehle vyapaariyon tak hi simit mana jaataa tha, yani bazaar main maang or bhav badhwane ke liye stock karnaa
 The difference is that this time farmers have adopted the technique of traders and this is a unique thing
 jaisaa ki padampur tehsil main fakirwali ke kaluram sirao bataate hai, ''mere paas 80 quintal guar padaa he
 We have pledged the jewels to our homes, but to keep the guar, i bought sacks and stuffed them
 '' ve bataate hai ki pichley saal dhanteras ko ek hi din main unke akele gaanv main majdoor varg ke log 28 bike nakad rupayon main kharid laae, yah tha guar kaa kamaal
 Gurpal Singh of 7 Vai village in Ganganagar tehsil is keeping the guar of last year with him
 tab unhone 15 quintal guar 15,000 ru
 Was sold at a price of Rs
 baad main bhav dugane ho gaye, tab bhi or badaae kii ummid main unhone use nahin bechaa
 They now have a stock of about 125 quintals
 ve nishcint hokar kehete hai, ''sarson kii nai fasal aa gai he
 The need of money and money will be fulfilled by it, then what is the hurry, will remain
 '' aam kisaanon ko lagata he ki vyapaariyon or guaragam udhyamiyon kaa ek tabaka is baar bhi unhen chhalane kii koshish main he taaki kheton se mandiyon main aane ke baad guar ke bhav badhen or vyapaaree uskaa phayda uthaaen
 Gurbalpal Singh Sandhu, associated with Sir Chhoturam Memorial Committee, remembers many such examples
 ve bataate hai ki pichley saal american kapaas kaa bazaar bhav 3,800 ru
 Was
 kisaanon ne apane paas roka, to iske bhav ho gaye 3,500 ru
 They state that in the same way, farmers got their wheat for Rs 1,200
 ke bhav par bechaa or vyapaariyon ke paas jane ke das din baad hi bhav 1,800 ru
 It was quintal
 guar main bhi aisa hi hua
 Most farmers sold guar cheaply, but the same was sold by traders for Rs 32,000
 tak bech jamkar munafa kuta
 By the way, Guar is called National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange Ltd
 (encidiex) yani vaayada kaarobaar main shaamil kiye jane se uske bhav itane chadhe the, par ab jab fasal aane ko hui, to guar ko isse baahar kar diya gaya or iske bhav dhadaam se neeche aa gire
 Sandhu asks, "barley, gram, mustard, potato are all in NCDX, so why not guar?" The Forward Trading Commission has also recommended this to the Union Ministry of Commerce and the inclusion of guar does not affect the general consumption goods, the government will also increase the foreign exchange income of farmers with good prices because of the guargram produced from guar Consumption is most abroad
 aise main yah anakani kyon?sandhu or kaluram sirao jaise anek log pichley disambar main ek ghatnakram par khaase hairaan rah gaye the
 When the Chhoturam Memorial Committee announced a demonstration in Jodhpur to demand guar to be included in the NCDX, just a day before the demonstration, some companies tried to thwart it by placing big advertisements in the newspapers here
 us vigyaapan kii bhashaa kul milakar aisi thi ki america or duusare deshon main guar ke vikalp kaam main liye ja rahe hai or usase guar kii maang kam ho gai he
 In such a situation, the use of guar will be left only for the oil and gas industries and that demand will not be able to absorb the increased yield this year
 sandhu kehete hai, ''companiyon kaa yah prachaar sirf kisaanon main ghabrahat paidaa karne ke liye tha, lekin kisaan us prachaar se prabhavit nahin hue, to ab duusare hatkande apanaae ja rahe hai
 '' Regional Deputy Director of Agricultural Marketing Department T
 aar
 Meena believes that the farmers are still not ready to bring all the guar to the mandis
 unke mutabik, in dinon ganganagar kii mandi main chaar se paanch hajaar bori kii aavak ho rahi he or paidaavaar ko dekhte hue yah koi khaas aavak nahin he
 According to information received from the department, in 2010-11, out of the nearly 7 lakh quintal guar that came in all the mandis of the district, most of it had come in by February
 yahi haal 2011-12 main bhi rahaa
 This time the yield is high, even by February, only about five and a half million quintals of guar came to be sold in the mandis
 haalanki vyapaaree hanuman goyal kehete hai, ''march maheene main gram seva sahakaari samitiyon or bainkon vagairah kaa karj ek baar clear karne ke liye kisaanon ko zyada guar nikaalnaa padegaa, chaahe bhav 10,000 ru
 Remain only per quintal
 goyal kii maane to kisaanon ne sweekaar kar liya he ki bhav pichley saal ke baraabar nahin pahunchenge or na hi ise vaayada kaarobaar main shaamil kiya jayega, lekin lagata he ki kisaanon ne aakhri maukey tak haath-pair maarane main koi kasar nahin chhodie kaa maanas bana liya he
 Now all eyes are on the proposed collectorate encirclement in Ganganagar on 25 March by the Sir Chhoturam Memorial Committee
 isamen mukhya maang guar ko vaayada kaarobaar main shaamil karne kii he
 The success or failure of this program can have a major impact on the changed landscape in guar-growing areas

 uttar pradesh kebulandshahrke dariyapur-amauli gaanv main musalamaanon kaa sabase bada dharmik aalami tabaligi iztima jari he
 Monday is the last day of this program which runs till 3 December
 is iztima main desh or duniya ke 10 lakh se zyada musalmaan shirkat karne pahunche hai
 By joining Ijtima which lasted for three days, lakhs of Muslims are praying for peace and peace in the world
 iztima main shaamil logon ke liye 8 lakh vargafoot jagah main pandal lagaaya gaya he
 What is Tabligi Jamaat? Tabligi Jamaat is a procession of people belonging to the Muslim community, which takes place every year at the state, national and international level, called Ijtima
 tabaligi shabd kaa matlab dharm kaa prachaar karnaa hota he
 Let me tell you, in the 20th century, the Tablighi Jamaatkoislamka was a big and important movement
 sabase pehali tabaligi jamaat mevaat main kii gai thi
 These Jamaat are usually of three, forty, four months or a year
 isamen logon ko daavat dekar unhen islam dharm kii jaankaree di jaati he
 How did Tabligi Ijtima start? Tabligi Ijtima started before independence in 1927, when Arya Samaj campaign was being carried out across the country by the Arya Samaj
 darasal,mughalkaal main kai logon ne islam dharm kabool kiya tha
 But even then they were following Hindu tradition and customs
 jiske baad arya samaaj ne unhen dobaaraa se hindu banane kaa shuddhikaran abhiyaan shuru kiya tha
 After seeing this, in the year 1927, Mohammad Ilyas Al Kandhalvi started the movement to spread Islam in India through Alami Tabligi Ijtima
 isamen unhone musalamaanon ko apane dharm main banaae rakhane ke liye islam dharm kaa prachaar kar jaankaree di or unhen islamdharmaka mahatv bataaya
 Let me tell you, the purpose of Tabligi Ijtima is to spread and spread spiritual Islam to Muslims
 is jamaat ke mukhya uddeshy "chha: usul" jaise-kalima, salaat, ilm, ikram-e-muslim, ikhlas-e-niyyat, daavat-o-tabalig the
 It is a religious propaganda movement and now this movement has spread to about 213 countries around the world
 sahaara samooh ne aaj supreme court main ek yachika daayar kar daawa kiya ki sheersh adaalat ke us aadesh main ek truti he, jisamen samooh kii 20 hajaar karod rupee mulya kii sampatti ke malikana haq ke dastavej sebi ko saunpe jane jane tak sahaara pramukh subrat raay ke khilaaf desh se baahar jane par roak laga di gai he
 Senior advocate CA Sundaram, appearing for the Sahara group, said that the apex court had on Monday said that if the documents are not submitted to the market regulator within three weeks, then only Rai will be prevented from going abroad
 unhone nyaayadhish kees radhakrishnan or eke sikari kii peeth ke samaksh kaha, lekin sheersh adaalat kii website par aplod kiya gaya aadesh kahata he ki sebi ko dastavej saunpe jane tak raay ko videsh jane se roak diya gaya he
 This is different from the Monday order of the bench
 sundaram kaa paksh sunne ke baad nyaayadhish sikari ne kaha ki vah peeth kaa hissaa rahe nyaayadhish jees khehad se vichaar-vimarsh karenge or samooh kii yachika par vichaar karenge
 Khehar was in the bench that had given the order on Monday
 sahaara samooh par ‘luka chuphi’ kaa khel khilne or us par ab adhik samay bharosa nahin kiye jane kii baat karte hue sheersh adaalat ne somvaar ko sahaara samooh ko nirdesh diya tha ki vah apni 20 hajaar karod rupee mulya kii sampatti ke malikana haq sambandhi dastavej sebi ko saunpe
 The court also warned that failing to do so would mean that Subrata Roy cannot leave India, but the order uploaded on the Supreme Court website says, the above instructions (documents relating to Malika Haq submitted to SEBI) As per sebi's satisfaction, they (rai and other directors) will not leave the country without the permission of the court, unless done
 kal nyaayadhish radhakrishnan or nyaayadhish khehad kii peeth ne yah aadesh paarit kiya tha
 The Supreme Court had made it clear that apart from depositing the investors' money with the market regulator, there is no other option left before the Sahara Group
 iske saath hi nyaayalay ne sahaara samooh ko sebi ko sampattiyon kii moolyankan report saunpane ko kaha he jo sampatti ke moolyacan kii jaanch karegaa
 Rai's lawyer had earlier said that this would affect his (rai's) reputation and business
 peeth ne haalanki sahaara samooh ko aashwaasan diya he ki yadi niveshkon kaa dhan waapas kiya jaataa he to uske hiton kii raksha kii jaaegi
 The apex court has fixed November 20 for the next hearing of the case when it will consider further order in respect of what will be done of the properties, whose ownership documents will be submitted to SEBI

 On Saturday, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and MP Sanjay Singh had said that the Congress was not ready for an alliance
 vahiin congress ke varisht netaa ahamed patel ne kaha ki dilli main loksabhaa kii saat siton par 4-3 formula par aam aadmi party se baat chal rahi thi
 If the Aam Aadmi Party is ready with this formula, then the Congress is also ready

 However, the talks of both have not been finalized yet

 In 2014, the BJP was in possession of all the seats, in the last Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party won all the seats in Delhi
 chandani chowk se harshavardhan, purv dilli se mahesh giri, nai dilli se minakshi lekhi, uttar purvi dilli se manoj tiwari, uttar pashchim dilli se udit raaj, dakshin dilli se ramesh bidhudi or pashchim dilli se pravesh verma ne jeet darj kii thi
 There was a Modi wave last time, due to which BJP easily won all the seats, but this time the contest will be tough
 idhar pratyaashee banaae jane ke baad bijepi dilli ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari or kendriya harshavardhan ne somvaar ko namakan daakhil karne kii baat kahi

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to the Election News Special Newsletter jaipur ke hingonia gaushala main gaayon ke marane ke maamle main aakhirkaar jaipur ke meyar ko mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne hataa diya
 The inquiry committee held Mayor Nirmal Nahata guilty in the case of thousands of cows dying in Hingonia Gaushala
 apni sarkaar kii teesri varshganth manaate hue vasundhara raaje ne 13 disambar ko jaipur meyar ko hataane kaa elaan kar diya
 On behalf of BJP state president Ashok Parnami it was said that Jaipur Mayor Nirmal Nahata has decided to step down as mayor for personal reasons
 darasal jab 'aaj tak' nehingonia gaushalaki durdasha dikhaai thi ki kis tarah se hajaaron gaayen bhukh-pyaas se tadap kar kai maheenon se daldal main funs kar mar rahi hai to bijepi ke jaipur meyar ko hataane kaa dabaav centre kii modi sarkaar or vasundhara sarkaar donon par tha
 Because Hingonia Gaushala had the responsibility of Jaipur Municipal Corporation
 jaanch cameti ne mana, nahata ne kii laaparvaaheelekin tab vasundhara raaje ke kareebi bijepi pradendhyaksh ashor paranami or vibhaag ke mantri raajapaal singh ne vasundhara ko manaa liya tha ki meyar kii galati nahi he
 Vasundhara Raje then constituted an inquiry committee
 cameti kii report ke anusaar meyar nirmal nahata kii laaparvaahee maani gai he or ye bhi kaha gaya he ki meyar kii jaankaree ke baavjoodgaayen mar rahi thi
 The mayor has also been blamed for not having informed the chief minister or the minister of the matter despite the situation deteriorating due to the strike for three months
 vipaksh ne uthaae kai sawaalhalanki vipaksh kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ne itani der kyon kar di
 The news of Hingonia came in the second week of August and now why is she removing the Mayor after four months? But it is a matter of discussion among the people that why Vasundhara Raje has announced this while celebrating her third anniversary? However, it was said on behalf of the government that before the Mayor and Jaipur Municipal Corporation, the charge of Hingonia Gaushala was given to Akshaya Patra in private hands
 or jaanch cameti kii report kaa intjaar kiya ja rahaa tha
 It is worth mentioning that on Saturday, the department of Urban Development Minister Rajpal Singh has also been changed and the Department of Gopalan is disengaged from Agriculture Minister Prabhulal Saini
 darasal gaay kii baat karne vaali bijepi ke liye janata ke bich janaa mushkil ho rahaa tha or kaaryakarataaon kaa taraf se party ko feedback mila tha ki sarkaar ke ection ke naam par chaar adhikariyon ke suspend karne or doshiyon par koi badi karrwai nahin karne se janata main galat maisaj gaya he
 At present, the BJP has closed all its councilors in a private hotel in Sitapura, from where the new mayor will be elected by bringing it directly to the Jaipur Municipal Corporation at 10 am
 apni shaadi main sabase khaas dikhne kii chahat dulhan hi nahin balki duulhe main bhi baraabar hoti he

 vitt mantralay ke mukhya aarthik salaahkaar kowshik basu ek nae vivaad main funs gaye hai
 This time the ruckus is about one of his statements
 dilli main ek kyrkram main bhaag lene pahunche kowshik basu se jab yah poocha gaya ki aarthik sudhaar kii yojana ko aage badhaane ke liye sarkaar kya kar rahi he


 to unhone jawaab diya
 
 
 'we have to move forward on some proposals for economic reform but the biggest obstacle in this way is the political parties associated with the UPA
 hamen in dalon ko aarthik sudhaar ke prastaavon kaa samarthan karne ke liye taiyaar karnaa hoga
 Kaushik Basu's statement has not gone down well with the supporters of the UPA
 samaajawaadee party ke netaa mohan singh ne enditivi se baatcheet main kaha ki kowshik basu desh kaa manobal giraane ke aadi ho chuke hai
 PM should try not to make any bureaucrat make a statement
 mohan singh ne kaha ki samaajawaadee party aarthik sudhaar ke alag−alag prastaavon ke gun−dosha ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi apana samarthan dene ke bare main faisla karegi or sapa aankh−mundakar upie kii nitiyon kaa samarthan nahin karegi
 On the other hand, the opposition is also concerned about the claim of Kaushik Basu, in which he said that it will take at least four more months to recover the economic situation in the country
 tippaniyan BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi alleged that the UPA government has been repeatedly claiming to improve the situation for the last seven years but the common people have not been given any relief so far, according to CPI MP d Raja, UPA government implements such economic policies
 Is doing so that ordinary people are not getting any benefit
 kowshik basu ke bayaan par netaa bhale hi naaraaz hon lekin yah kahana bhi galat nahin hoga ki upie-2 lambey samay se lambit aarthik sudhaar ke agenda ko aage badhaane main naakaam sabit hui he jisapar virodh na sirf upie ke baahar se he balki upie ke andar se mamata ke virodh kii vajah se bhi sudhaar ke agenda ko aage badhanaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 Kaushik Basu, who arrived in Delhi to participate in a program, was asked what the government was doing to pursue the economic reform plan



 
 
 'hamen aarthik sudhaar ke kuch prastaavon par aage badhanaa hoga lekin iske raste main sabase bada roda gathbandhan upie se jude raajnneetik dal hai
 We must prepare these parties to support proposals for economic reform
 kowshik basu kaa yah bayaan upie ke samarthak dalon ko raas nahin aayaa he
 Samajwadi Party leader Mohan Singh told NDTV that Kaushik Basu has become accustomed to plunging the morale of the country

 Mohan Singh said that the Samajwadi Party will decide to give its support only after taking into account the merits of different proposals for economic reform and the SP will not blindly support the policies of the UPA

 Kaushik Basu's statement may be upset with the politicians but it would not be wrong to say that UPA-2 has failed to carry forward the agenda of long-pending economic reforms to which opposition is not only from outside the UPA but inside the UPA Due to opposition from Mamata, it is also difficult to move forward the reform agenda

 The practice of Hanumanji on Tuesday of the month of Sawan is considered very fruitful
 yah upaay saare kashton ko dur karata he or saath hi aisa karne se bholenath prasann hokar apane bhakton kii har muraad puri karte hai
 If Bajrang Bali is to be pleased and at the same time to get the blessings of Shiva, then one must worship Hanuman in the month of Shravan
 1
 The first solution is to wash and wear clean washed clothes on any Tuesday of the month of August
 iske baad najdiki hanuman mandir main jaakar chameli ke tel tathaa sindur mishrit chola chadhayen
 Also, while offering the Chola, light a lamp in front of Hanuman
 deepak main bhi chameli ke tel kaa hi upyog karen
 After offering the chola, garland the flower of Hanuman to Hanuman and sprinkle the perfume of Kevade on both the shoulders of the idol of Hanuman
 ab ek saabut paan kaa patta len or iske upar thodaa gud va chanaa rakh kar hanumanji ko iskaa bhoga lagaaein
 After offering bhoga, sit at the same place for a while and chant the mantra written below with a basil garland
 kam se kam 5 maala jap avashya karen
 mantra-ram Rameti Rameti Ramay Ramay Manorama
 sahastra naam tattunyan ram naam varaanane
 
 ab hanumanji ko chadhaaen gaye gulab ke phool kii maala se ek phool tod kar use ek laal kapade main lapetakar apane dhan sthaan yani tijori main rakhen
 At the same time money will start coming into the house
 2
 The second solution is to break a leaf of the big tree and wash it with clean clean water after bathing in any morning of the morning
 ab is pattey ko kuch der hanumanji kii pratimaa ke saamne rakhen or iske baad is par kesar se shriram likhen
 Now keep this leaf in your purse
 saal bhar aapkaa purse paison se bharaa rahegaa
 After this, when the month of Sawan comes again, flow this leaf in a river and likewise keep another leaf in your purse
 3
 The third way is to go to a Hanuman ji temple on Tuesday in Savan and sit there and recite the Rama Raksha Strata
 iske baad hanumanji ko gud or chane kaa bhoga lagaaein
 If there is any problem in life, pray for redressal
 4
 The fourth remedy is to visit a temple on Tuesday in Savan where there is a statue of both Lord Shiva and Hanuman
 vahaan jaakar shiv va hanumanji kii pratimaa ke saamne shuddh ghi ke deepak jalaaen
 After that, sit there and read Shiva Chalisa and Hanuman Chalisa
 is upaay se bhagavanshiv va hanumanjidonon kii hi krupa aapako praapt hogi
 5
 paanchavaa upaysavan ke mangalvaar ko paas hi sthit hanumanji ke kisi mandir main jaaen or hanumanji ko sindur va chameli kaa tel arpit karen or apni manokamana kahen
 This makes Hanumanji happy and fulfills every wish of the devotee

 ’ The threat of elections is now heard in Delhi
 congress sarkaar ne dilli ke us sabase bade vot bank par nazar gada rakhi he, jise pichley paanch saalon se regularigeshan ke jhunjhune kii aawaaj suna kar hi rijhaayaa ja rahaa he
 But the fear of seeing what we are going to disclose is that once again the hands of millions of Delhiites hoping to get the colony confirmed will not be left empty
 dilli ajtak ke haath sieji ke audit memo lagi he
 There are many shocking revelations in this
 vikaas kii raftaar main kahin peeche chhot chuki coloniyon kii oonghti galiyon se hi dilli ke singhaasana kaa rasta jaataa he
 The government knows very well that if it confirmed this vote bank, it won the elections
 isliye pichley chunaavon se thik pehle in coloniyon ke ardblue numaayindon ko upie adhyaksha sonia gandhi ke haathon proviginal certificate bantwaaye gaye
 But since then, the CAG has questioned the entire process of regularization on the basis of the same documents that the government has done
 coloniyon ko niyamit karne main supreme court ke adeshon kii avehalanaa se lekar bina kisi manyata vaale proviginal certificate ke naam par sawaal uthaaya gaya he
 When Delhi Aaj Tak got the exclusive information of this report, we also got the whole case approved by the minister associated with this issue
 ab mantri chaahe ise jitna halkaa maane lekin dilli ajtak ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik sieji ne das binduon par sarkaar ke daavon kii bakhiya udhedi he
 One by one, we tell you all the aspects on which the CAG has surrounded the government
 maamla number ek- sarkaar ne supreme court ke adeshon kii avhelnaa keemaamala number do- proviginal certificate ke naam par phijulkharchi hui,maamla number-3- certificate dene ke saal bhar ke bheetar regularigeshan puraa nahin huamamla number 4- rajasav vibhaag ke veriphication ke bina coloniyon kii boundry tay kii gaimamla number 5- boundry tay karne main galtiyaan huinmamla number 6- boundry tay karne main dhaandhlee kii gaimamla number 7- le out plan banane main emsidi ne deree keemaamala number 8- regularigeshan ke liye alag-alag vibhaagon se anumati nahin lee gaimamla number 9- ardblue ke aavednon kaa record nahin rakhaa gayamamla number 10- ardblue ke aavednon kii jaanch nahin hui
 That is, if you do not go to the bottom of this matter, then only and only in these points is the government's opening
 vipaksh bhi isapar sarkaar ko gher rahaa he
 The CAG has also written in its report that not all the files it asked for from the government were provided
 yahaan tak ki in coloniyon main ab tak kitna paisa laga he isaki jaankaree dene se bhi sarkaar batch rahi he
 In the raw colonies, this surety game of deceit does not end here
 sieji ne sarkari kaam main or bhi gadabadiyon kaa zikr kiya he
 Somewhere the population was increased to regularize the colony, while elsewhere the vacant land was also included in the map of the colony
 sieji kii report nau pez kii he jisamen kai khaamiyon ko vistaar se bataaya gaya he
 The CAG has said that the department has allocated thousands of crores in the name of regularizing the colonies but they are not giving accounts of it
 sieji ne to kai coloniyon kaa udhaaharan bhi apni report main dekar kaha he ki kaise sarkari filon main ek hi kollani ke bare main aabaadi se lekar nakshe ke maamle main do aankade die gaye hai
 You will be shocked to know how the game is going on in the name of raw colonies in Delhi
 kya ek hi colony main ek hi taarikh ko aabaadi ke do alag-alag aankade ho sakate hai, nahin naa
 
 
 But not many of Delhi's unauthorized colonies have happened in many cases
 sieji kii report main to ek udhaaharan aisa he jahaan par basaavat 25 fisadi se bhi kam thi lekin sarkaar kii filon main use niyamit karne ke liye 81 fisadi kar diya gaya
 Similarly, the case of land misappropriation has also been revealed in the government files
 sarkaar ne jo 28 filein di hai unamem 16 filon main to nakshe sieji ko mili hi nahi
 Maps of 12 colonies were found where empty lands were also merged into the colony
 aisi gadabadiyon ke baavjood sarkaar ab bhi coloniyon main kaam or aage badhaane main lagi he
 According to the rules of regularization, it is necessary to get approval from those departments in the colonies in which the government lands
 lekin sieji report main saaf bataaya gaya he ki didie, jal board, railway jaisi agenciyon kii zamin ko bhi sarkaar ne bina puche niyamit kar diya
 Apart from this, the rebellion within the government is also mentioned in the report, which states that the Deputy Commissioner in different districts also explicitly refused to rectify the mistakes made in the colonies
 sirf sarkaar hi nahin balki let-latifi ke liye emsidi kii bhi is report main khinchaai kii gai he
 This CAG report comes at a time when elections are at its head
 aise main hangaamaa to machega or aise main coloniyon ke kanfusion par sarkaar ko jawaab dena baari pad saktaa he
 Especially when the CAG has raised these questions

 How the Ministry of Agriculture became a Farmer Welfare Ministry After the formation of the BJP government at the Center in 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made several changes in its functioning by linking the Ministry of Agriculture with Farmers Welfare
 krishi mantralay ko nae naam krishi evam kisaan kalyaan mantralay ke naam se janaa jane laga
 The Welfare Department was created under the Ministry and its work was entrusted to a senior officer
 vibhaag kaa kaam yah dekhnaa he ki kisaanon kaa kalyaan kitna ho rahaa he, nahin ho rahaa he to kya aadchan aa rahi hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given the slogan 'more drop more crop' as he formed his government at the Center

 Before that, the girl who died in Simdega was also ill, she had malaria
 yah bhukh se maut ke maamle bilkul nahin hai
 He said that Adam Tribe of Jharkhand is still not linked to Aadhaar but under the postman scheme, 35 kg of food grains are given to them every month
 agar puraa rashan card aadhaar se link ho jaae to sarkaar ke 500 karod bachenge
 Realizing the Prime Minister's dream of corruption-free India, Hagar Raghuvar Das also attacked the Congress
 unhone kaha ki is desh main congress ne 60 saalon tak shashan kiya to ab tak garibi kyon nahin miti, kya iskijimmedaarbhi modi sarkaar he? unhone kaha ki congress baukhala gai he or parivaar kii bhakthi main juty he

 Telling the story behind the film's Zero title, director Anand Rai said in an interview to PTI - It would be wrong to guess the screenplay after seeing the film's first look
 hamane film main zero kii mahatta ko darshane kii koshish kii he

 The Indian team has suffered a crushing defeat in the Brisbane ODI
 team india pehle khelte hue 39 over main sirf 153 ranon par simat gai
 Stuart Binny scored 44 runs for the Indian team
 binni ke alaava dhoni ne 34 or rahane ne 33 ran banaae
 For England, Finn took 5 and Anderson took 4 wickets
 england kii taraf se ian bel ne shandaar pradarshan karte hue 88 ran banaae
 His partner James Taylor also hit a brilliant half-century
 bhartiya team iske saath hi tri siries main apana doosraa match bhi haar gai he
 With this, it has become difficult for Team India to reach the final of this series
 england ne yah match bonus ank ke saath jeeta he
 India's start was very bad and Shikhar Dhawan returned to the pavilion for just 1 run
 iske baad rahane or raidu ne team ko sanbhaalane kii koshish kii lekin wo bhi zyada der nahin tik paae
 Half the team had returned to the pavilion on the score of 67 runs
 binni ke alaava captain dhoni ne bharat ko sanbhaalane kii koshish kii lekin aaj vah bhi bharat ke sankatmochak sabit nahin ho paae
 Dhoni scored 34 runs
 in ballebaajon ke alaava rahane ne 33 ran banaae
 Find out the havoc of English fast bowlers on India with the fact that Finn and Anderson shared 9 wickets out of 10
 england kii taraf se tej gendbaaj fin ne 8 over main 33 ran dekar 5 ballebaajon ko pavilion kii raah dikhaai
 Supporting him, James Anderson took 4 wickets for just 18 runs in 8 overs
 team india ke duusare salaami ballebaaj shikhar dhawan lagaataar kharaab form main hai
 Ajinkya Rahane will have to score third and Virat Kohli at number four, so that there is no pressure on the middle order
 olerounder rabindra jadeja kii gaiyr maujuudagi main aakhri overon main teji se ran banane kaa dabaav captain emes dhoni par hoga
 Losing early wickets early can put pressure on them
 ek or haar se bharat ke liye siries main vaapasi karnaa bahut mushkil ho jayega
 This is India's last XI: Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli, Ambati Rayudu, Suresh Raina, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Stewart Binny, Akshar Patel, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav duniya bhar main saste mulya par dharmik sahitya ke nirdosh mudran or vitaran ke liye prasiddh or apane kism ke sabase bade prakaashan grih kii pahchaan rakhane vaale gita press main hadtaal to khatm ho gayi he par iskaa asar abhi aane vaale kuch dinon tak bana rahegaa

 His biggest agenda was to end the Big-3 model
 unki raay rahi he ki har desh ko isisi kii kamai main baraabar hissaa milanaa chahie
 The comments shashaank manohar se zyada bisisiai ko andruni avyavashtha kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 After a long court battle, the Justice Lodha Committee appointed by the Supreme Court made several suggestions for reforming the BCCI, but it has still not been fully implemented
 filhal bisisiai kaa kaamkaaj COA yani prashaskon kii samiti dekh rahi he
 This includes former India CAG Vinod Rai, former women cricketer Diana Edulji, cricket writer Ramchandra Guha and IDFC Bank Managing Director Vikram Limaye
 samay or anubhav kii kami ke kaaran isisi main ye cameti big-3 revenue model par sadsy deshon ko apane paksh main nahin mode pai
 However, there was no direct role in it
 big-3 revenue model ke hatane se bharat kii aamadani 3,660 karod se ghatakar kareeb 1,860 karod rah gai he
 Obviously, the BCCI needs to get its house repaired soon
 varanaa aane vaale samay main mushkilen or bad sakati hai
 BCCI suffered more from internal clutter than Shashank Manohar
 lambii adalati ladaai ke baad supreme court dwaara niyukt justise lodha cameti ne bisisiai main sudhaar ke liye kai suzav die, lekin ise ab bhi puri tarah lagu nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 The BCCI is currently overseen by the COA, the committee of administrators
 isamen bharat ke purv CAG vinod raay, purv mahila cricketer dyna edulaji, cricket lekhak ramchandra guha or IDFC bank ke managing diarector vikram limaye shaamil hai
 Due to lack of time and experience, this committee in the ICC could not turn member countries on the Big-3 revenue model
 haalanki iskaa sidhe isamen koi role nahin tha
 With the removal of the Big-3 revenue model, India's income has come down from 3,660 crore to about 1,860 crore
 zaahir he bisisiai ko jald hi apana ghar durust karne kii zarurat he
 Otherwise, difficulties may increase in the time to come
 big-3 revenue model ke hatane se bharat kii aamadani 3,660 karod se ghatakar kareeb 1,860 karod rah gai he

 Aam Aadmi Party leader HS Phoolka has on Monday alleged alliances in the Akali, Congress and BJP in Punjab
 ravivaar ko mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne punjab kii jansabha main zikr kiya tha ki bijepi or akali dal milakar congress ko saport kar rahe hai or congress ke prachaar main akaliyon dwaara drugs se kamai rakam ko durupyog kiya ja rahaa he
 HS Phulkane told, 'jagdish Tytler's case related to the 1984 slaughtering in the CBI court is telling that Narendra Singh is not getting caught
 phulka ne kaha ki hamane ek phone number diya he, use galat bataaya gaya
 Today a newspaper has published the news, in which the reporter has spoken on the same phone number
 narendra singh ne kaha ki ve sibiai jaanch main sahyog karne ko taiyaar hai
 He told that Mr
 Khan, a CBI officer, approached me
 use bhi iske bare main bataa diya gaya
 Questioning the disappearance of the witness, Phoolka said that in order to save Tytler, she was lying in the CBI court
 agar titalar ke khilaaf karrwai hoti he, to congress ko punjab main nuksaan hoga
 This is a big proof of the nexus that the Modi government is pressurizing the CBI to lie to the court to pressure the Congress
 aapako bataa den ki siedervind kejariwalravivaar se 25 oktober tak teen divasiy punjab daure par hai
 They are meeting with local leaders, candidates and activists to formulate election strategies
 pehle dakshin africa or ab newzealand daura, donon main jo ek baat samaan he wo ye ki donon hi baar gautam gambhir kaa naam bhartiya team main shaamil nahin he
 Gambhir is being repeatedly ignored by selectors despite consistent performances first in the county and then in the Ranji Trophy
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki aakhir gambhir ko aisa kya karnaa padegaa, jisase uski team india main vaapasi hogi?gautam gambhir ne shuruyaat se hi cricket se junun kii had tak mohabbat kii he, or yahi vajah he ki wo maidan ke andar ho yaa maidan ke baahar kisi se dabe nahin
 Whether it is about scoring runs or of verbal warfare, Gambhir was nowhere behind
 shahid afridi ke saath bhidnt or ipel main viraat kohli ke saath tu-tu-main-main kii ghatnaayen aaj bhi aapke zehan main tazaa hongi
 Recently, there were also reports that Gambhir had a grudge with DDCA officials and selectors
 to aise main kya unka ye 'bagawati' ravaiya kahin unke chayan ke aade to nahin aa rahaa?gambhir ne ranjai trophy main 578 ran banaae, jisamen ek shatak or teen ardhashatak shaamil rahe
 After not being selected for the tour of South Africa, everyone expected that Gambhir would be chosen at least for the tour of New Zealand, but here too, disappointment
 aaj tak se khaas baatcheet main gambhir ne bhi is baat ko mana ki haa unhen niraashaa zarur hui he
 In 2009, when India returned home after beating New Zealand for the first time on their own soil , the hero of that victory was none other than Gautam Gambhir
 bharat ne 41 saalon ke intazaar ke baad 3 maichon kii siries main newzealand ko 1-0 se haraaya tha
 On the swinging conditions and bouncy pitches, Gambhir scored the highest 445 runs for India in three Tests, including 2 magnificent centuries and a half-century
 is sabake baavjood chayankartaaon ne gambhir ko mauqaa nahin diya
 Amidst all these disappointments, Gambhir hopes that he will return to the team soon
 ab dekhne vaali baat ye hogi ki pichhali siries main team ke liye turup kaa ikkaa sabit hue gautam gambhir ke bina newzealand main bharat kaisaa pradarshan karata he

 jaisi kii ummid kii ja rahi thi amit shah ke 'pehle obisi pradhanmantri' vaale bayaan par sabase zyada haituba bihar main hi machi
 On the facts, even if Amit Shah's declaration of Narendra Modi as the first 'OBC Prime Minister' does not come true, the thoughtful strategy behind this statement cannot be denied
 raajnneeti main kai baar ‘tathy’ or ‘satya’ apni-apni suvidha ke anusaar gadhe jate hai or phir devegoda jis daur main pradhanmantri bane the vah daur kaaphi peeche chhot chukaa he
 In today's world full of 24-hour news, such statements with political meanings have their own distinct space and effect
 bihar main endie ho yaa janata parivaar-congress-ensipi gathbandhan, chunaav main ek acchhee badhat paane ke liye donon ko pichde or ati-pichde matadaataaon ke ek prabhavi hisse ko apni taraf kheenchna hi hoga
 Amidst all the claims and counter-claims of 'evolutionary politics', the possibility and importance of social engineering and re-engineering was there and still is today
 isi kadi main bijepi kii ranneeti sabase bade matadaata samooh yani yadav matadaataaon ko apane paale main laane kii dikh rahi he
 In this effort of BJP, leaders like Ramkripal Yadav, Nandkishore Yadav, Hukumdev Narayan Yadav, Nityananda Rai appear to be busy with all their strength
 bihar vidhaan parishad chunaavonke nattejey is myne main bijepi ke liye utsahvardhak hai
 The defeat of JDU candidates especially in Patna and Chhapra seats can be taken to mean that Yadav voters there voted in favor of independents instead of JDU candidates
 chhapra main jadyu ne vidhaan parishad ke upasabhapati saleem parvaiz ko apana pratyaashee banaaya tha par unhen baari shikast mili
 In Patna too, the JDU candidate lost to Ritlal Yadav

 There is a lot of speculation about whether this time when the Finance Minister presents the budget on February 1, it will be the Vote on Account (interim Budget) or the BJP Government will present the full budget, breaking the tradition
 aisa kaha ja rahaa he ki endie sarkaar is baar purna bajet pesh karegi, yah bharosa jataane ke liye ki 2019 ke aam chunaav main jitkar vah phir se satta main aegi
 It is believed that many populist announcements can be made in this budget
 vitt mantralay or bharat sarkaar ke haal ke twit dekhen to yah baat saaf najar aati he
 Many such tweets have spoken of introducing 'union Budget' or 'budget 2019' on February 1, whereas earlier the more acceptable 'vote-on-account' (vote on Account) was used for such Interim Budget
 
 yahaan tak ki soshal media ke heshtags main bhi # Budget2019 likhaa gaya he
 The tradition created because of this is that the common tradition has been that during the election year, the government has been presenting the Vote on Account or Interim Budget
 yah asal main naitikta kaa masalaa he
 The outgoing government submits the Vote on Account and takes the permission of Parliament on it until the budget of the new government comes
 sarkaar aane vaali sarkaar par apni nitiyaan nahin thopanaa chaahati
 Maybe the new government that comes after the election may not like the policies of the previous government and it will completely reverse it
 isliye yah parampara ban gai he ki kisi bhi sarkaar kaa antim yani chunaav ke saal vaala bajet antarim bajet hota he or chunaav ke baad jo sarkaar aati he, vah purna bajet pesh karti he
 Indications to the industry, but perhaps this time the government will not be bound under any such bond
 pichley kuch hafton se udyog chambers, corporate jagat, accountents, kansaltents aadi sarkaar se milakar bajet par apni vicialist yaa salaah de rahe hai or in baithkon se lautne vaale logon main yah raay banati dikh rahi he ki sarkaar usee tarah se purna bajet pesh karne ja rahi he jaisaa ki pichley varshon main kiya gaya
 There will be a budget speech in the same way, i
e
 this time also in the budget, the government can give people the gift of changes in tax slabs, new schemes, exemptions, new announcements
 ek sheersh udyog chembar ke pramukh kehete hai, 'sarkaar yah sanket dene kii koshish karegi ki aap yadi phir se is sarkaar ko chunenge to jo kuch bataaya ja rahaa he, vah milegaa
 So this time the government can emphasize tax concessions in the budget (eg limit of income tax exemption to 5 lakh), changes in excise, new schemes and new announcements
 udyog chambers kaa kahana he ki tamaam sector ke logon ne is baar yah maanakar sarkaar ko apni sifarish nahin bheji thi ki chunavi saal main antarim bajet hi aayega
 However, recommendations were sought from the government, showing some great enthusiasm
 udyog jagat iske liye taiyaar nahin tha or kai udyog sanghathanon ko to yuddh str par raturaat siforishein taiyaar karaani padin
 If we look at the history before that, in 1991, Yashwant Sinha, who was the finance minister in Chandrashekhar's government, made a big announcement like disinvestment of public companies in the account
 yahi nahin farvari, 2014 main upie sarkaar kaa antarim bajet pesh karte hue tatkaaleen vitt mantri pi

 naubat ye aa gai ki swami ramdev ko baar-baar logon se sanyam kii apil kerani padi lekin bekaabu bheed par koi asar nahin hua
 The result was that yoga ended there and the speeches of the leaders started from the stage
 
 
 
 And then many new world records were also made on Yoga Day at the Broken World Record Yoga Camp

 Before the Haryana elections, the big bet to help the farmers, CM has given interest-penalty to the debt of the farmers, 10 lakh farmers will get the benefits, 4750 crores will be spent

 mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ne 'jan aashirwad yatra' ke jariye bijepi ke paksh main maahaul banane ke saath-saath kisaanon ko saadhane kaa bada daanv chalaa he
 Before the assembly elections, Chief Minister Khattar has given a big gift to about 10 lakh farmers of Haryana before the assembly elections
 manohar laal khatter ne somvaar ko jan aashirwad rath yatra ke dauraan sahakaari bainkon ke rini kisaanon ke liye ekamusth samaadhaan yojana (otias) kaa elaan kiya
 Under this scheme, about 4750 crore rupees of loan interest and penalty will be waived
 vidhansabha chunaav se pehle bijepi kaa bada daanv mana ja rahaa he, kyonki haryana main kisaan satta banane or bigaadane kii takat rakhte hai
 Benefit will be given on the loan taken from these cooperative banks
 The indebted farmers of Primary Cooperative Agriculture Societies, District Central Cooperative Bank, Haryana Land Reforms and Development Bank will get direct benefits of this scheme

 10 lakh rini kisaan hai
 Through these banks, farmers have taken loans for the crop

 rajdhani dilli ke ek sampann ilaake main kalatmak tareeke se bane apane daftar main kanoonee dastavejon ke dher main duube ek haai-profile vakil or congress netaa ne party kii dikkaton kii ek behad sahaj-si vyakhya kii—loktantr kaa overdoj
 They consider it the biggest irony of Indian democracy
 supreme court main vakaalat karne vaale is netaa kaa kahana tha, ''hamaari party vah he jiske mukhiya vansh parampara ke netaa hai lekin ve sabko khush karne or harek kii baat ko jagah dene kii koshish main faisle lene main atyadhik loktantric ho jate hai
 The result is that they are unable to take any decision
 iske vipareet bhaajapa loktantric party he lekin usamen do vyakti taanaashaahee tareeke se saare faisle karte hai—sahi ho yaa galat—or un faislon ko sabhi chupchaap maanate hai
 This difference makes the success and failure of two national parties clear in India
 ''adaalat kii hi tarah ve yahaan bhi subut saamne rakhte hai
 Just before the Uttar Pradesh elections this year, the Congress spent three months deciding where and how Priyanka Gandhi will campaign
 ant main, kai daur ke vichaar-vimarsh ke baad tay kiya gaya ki ve keval raibareli or amethi main hi prachaar karengi
 He said, "so much time was wasted in deciding that she will continue to do what she has been doing already
" '' congress main aise hi kai faislon kaa abhi intjaar chal rahaa he
 Elections are going to be held in Himachal Pradesh this year
 maang uth rahi he ki bhrashtachar ke kai maamalon main ghire biimaar mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ko party kaa netritv karne kaa phir se mauka na diya jaae
 Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh are due next year and veteran leader Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia, the party's chief whip in the Lok Sabha, are both expected to be contenders for the post of chief minister
 abhi yah bhi saaf nahin he ki is saal ke aakhir main gujarat main hone vaale chunaavon main party kii kaman koun sanbhaalega
 The national roadmap of the Congress is also unclear
 india today ne jis bhi netaa se baatcheet kii, usne yahi kaha ki party ko pehle rajyon main punerjeevit karnaa chahie, jahaan se lokipray bhavi netaa ubharkar saamne aaenge
 This will be possible only when the roots of the Congress are strengthened

 Two years ago, in 2015, before his famous holiday for Vipassana, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi handed over the blue print to his mother to re-establish the party
 vah khaakaa mukhya rup se inhen sujhaavon ko irdagird tha
 But that blue print has been gathering dust ever since
 party adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke najdiki maane jane vaale zyaadaatar netaaon kaa maananaa he ki faisle rahul kii vajah se latake hue hai
 In recent years, 70-year-old Sonia Gandhi, who has been suffering from many physical problems, has given most of her rights to Rahul
 ek samay rahul ke rajnatik sangrakshak maane jane vaale varisht party netaa digvijay singh kaa kahana he ki ''unhen faisle lene chahie
 People loved Indira Gandhi because she made decisions
 narendra modi faisle lete hai—sahi, galat yaa nirpeksh
 But not taking decisions has caused the party the biggest loss
 ''haalanki gaahe-bagaahe kuch faisle hote rahe hai
 Digvijay Singh was removed as the general secretary in-charge of Goa and Karnataka after the Congress failed to form the government even after winning more seats than the BJP in Goa assembly elections this year
 congress shasit sabase bade rajya karnataka ke prabharee mahasachiv kaa kaam kerala se saansad 55 saal ke ke
 C
 venugopal ko de diya gaya
 Venugopal is often seen sitting next to Rahul in the Lok Sabha
 rahul ke sabase pasandida rahe mohan prakaash ko bhi empi ke prabharee mahasachiv ke pad se hataa diya gaya he, jisase digvijay, sindhiya or kamalnath ko khushi hi hui hogi
 If people close to Rahul are to be believed, there will be many revolutionary types of decisions as soon as he becomes the party president
 ab yah lagbhag tay he ki rahul agle maheene hone vaale congress ke sanghathanaatmak chunaav main adhyaksh pad ke liye chunaav ladenge
 He gave this indication in a speech at the University of California at Berkeley
 sonia ke ek najdiki sutara kaa kahana he ki ve rahul ke adhyaksh kaa chunaav ladgaye ke khilaaf hai
 He fears that someone else may jump into the fray and that Rahul should not face embarrassment because Rahul's popularity in the lower cadre is questionable
 party ke rajyasabha saansad abhishek manu singhvi kehete hai ki congress ko dil kadaa karke rahul ke adhyaksh banane ke bare main faisla le lenaa chahie
 Whatever the reason behind it, there should be no delay in this work
 kai rajyon ke prabharee ek anya mahasachiv kaa daawa he ki rahul ke pad sambhalate hi faisle lene kii gati, prakriya or party kaa kor dhaancha, sab badal jayega
 a
 chellakumar or venugopal jaise logon ko un puraane netaaon kii jagah rajyon kaa prabhaar diya ja rahaa he jo pehle kai ilaakon main dakhal rakhaa karte the
 However, there is a slight discrepancy in this process as well
 rahul ke do kareebi mohanprakaash or madhusudan mistre par to party ke kharaab pradarshan kii gaaj giri jabaki purv kendriya mantri si
 P
 joshi ab bhi samooche purvottar, bihar or pashchim bengal kaa jimmaa sanbhale hue hai
 The party was out of power in Assam, Bihar and Manipur and many leaders left and Joshi kept watching
 joshi kaa kahana he ki rahul ke pradarshan kaa moolyankan karnaa abhi jaij nahin hoga
 He says, "sonia took charge of the party in 1998 and the party came to power six years later (at the Center)
" rahul ne to abhi shuruyaat bhi nahin kii he
 However, Joshi forgets that Rahul has been part of the decision-making process in the party for nearly a decade, which he himself has accepted at Berkeley
 jammu-kashmir main shanti laane kaa shrey lene ke chakkar main unhone yah kah diya tha ki ve upie sarkaron ke saath kareeb se kaam karte rahe hai jabaki yah unke ab tak ke rukh se bilkul ulat tha jisamen ve kehete rahe hai ki unhen beja tareeke se us sarkaar ke faislon ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya jaataa rahaa he jisamen ve shaamil hi nahin the
 Many Congress leaders say that Rahul's speech in Berkeley outlines his plans for the revival of the party and also indicates his changed attitude against the propaganda against him
 pehali baar unhone parivaarwaad ke thappe kaa bachaav nahin kiya balki use bhartiya raajnneeti kaa abhinn hissaa bataaya
 But he also made it clear that he would choose the democratic path to the top post of the party, to contest elections
 party ke diggajon ke liye raahat kii baat yahi thi ki unhone is baat kaa saaf sanket de diya ki unki sambhavit kor team main yuva or tajurbekaaron kaa mishran hoga
 He also honestly believed that he was in favor of the young leaders but now a talented elderly brigade is needed to run the organization
 iske kai sanket pehle hi mil rahe hai, or inamen sabase mahatvapurn manmohan singh kaa phir ubharna he jinhen jidipi se kashmir tak vibhinn muddon par modi sarkaar par hamalaa bolne ke liye maidan main utaara ja rahaa he
 In perhaps the first of his kind attempts to directly respond to the efforts of '1,000 sitting at the computer' to create an image of a 'reluctant' leader, Rahul challenged UC Berkeley students to evaluate their merit based on what they said
 Do on sabase khaas to 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye pradhanmantri modi ke khilaaf unki ubhartee ranneeti he
 He has admitted that he is not equal to Modi in the art of making speeches
 ve yah bhi samaj gaye hai ki rashtravaadi ho-halle ke bich mek in india jaisi piem kii yojanaon par hamale karne kaa ulataa asar hoga
 Instead, they have decided to hurt the government for the issues where it is suffering the most - the economy and jobs
 notebandi or jiesti ke baad rahul ne mek in india ko chote or majhole upakramon ke laabh ke liye niojit karne kii baat uthaai
 He reminded that the government is creating only 500 jobs daily while the need is 30,000 jobs
 unhone badhati sampradayik hinsa or ashishnutaa kaa zikr kiya
 Avoiding a direct fight with Modi, Rahul opens a front against another enemy - the Sangh
 sangh kaaryakartaaon dwaara un par daage gaye manahani ke do daavon ke bich, sanghathan par unka dhyaan kendrit karnaa samaj main aata he
 The nationwide structure of the Sangh has been instrumental in the expansion of the BJP
 digvijay kehete hai, ''yah vichaardhaara kii ladaai he or sangh un chizon ke khilaaf he jo bharat ko banaati hai
 "A Delhi leader said," If they do not make the party strong at the lower level, then you will not be able to fight against AAP in Delhi, far from facing the Sangh or BJP
 '' kya unke paas 2019 ke chunaavon ke liye koi ranneeti he? joshi ise bade aasaan tareeke se saamne rakhte hai
 First, the parties that performed well in the 2014 elections have to be brought together
 ve kehete hai, ''bihar chunaav ne yah sabit kar diya he ki bhaajapa ko haraaya ja saktaa he
 However, it may be difficult for Rahul to bring SP, BSP, RJD, Trinamool, Left, BJD and DMK together
 isiilie rahul ke party kaman sanbhaalane ke baavjood sonia upie adhyaksh bani rahengi
 Right now Rahul is ready to jump into the ground , he has also identified his main enemy
 ek badi mushkil bhi he
 a Congress general secretary says, "rahul is still questioning and presenting no solution
" seekhney kii prakriya pehle hi bahut lambii ho chuki he
 In Berkeley, Rahul said that he would communicate many more
 shaayad unhen logon ko yah bhi bataanaa padegaa ki ve modi kaa vikalp pesh kar sakate hai

 chhattisgarh main rajya ke purv mukhyamantri ajit jogi kii patni renu jogi kaa kota vidhansabha seat se tikat cat gaya he
 In his place, the party has fielded Vibhor Singh
 vibhor singh chhattisgarh police main dspi ke pad par tainaat the
 He recently joined the Congress by resigning from the job
 renu jogi ko lekar pehle se hi andeshaa jaahir kiya ja rahaa tha ki congress is baar unhen tikat nahin degi
 The same happened when the last list of the Congress came on Thursday evening
 haalanki renu jogi ko iskaa ahsaas pehle se hi tha
 Therefore, he had bought his nomination form from Kota assembly seat on behalf of Janata Congress Jogi two days ago
 is baat kii charchaa joro par he ki shanivaar ko renu jogi vidhivat rup se apni paariwarik party janata congress jogi main shaamil ho jaaengi
 It is also being said that she will also file her nomination from Kota assembly seat
 renu jogi ne tikat kaate jane ke baad elaan kiya he ki wo kota se chunaav ladengi lekin unhone yah saaf nahin kiya he ki kis party se chunavi maidan main utrengi
 What did Renu Jogi write in the letter to Sonia? There is a lot of discussion in the political circles about the letter of Renu Jogi, which she has written to former Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 renu jogi ne sonia ko likhe patr main kaha he ki farji sidi laakar mere pati or putr ko badnaam kiya gaya, main chup rahi
 i have been continuously humiliated for two years but never told you a word, i kept quiet
 hameshaa party hit ke liye chupchaap sab sahati rahi
 Not even for a moment did i feel that you are not standing with me
 maine hameshaa congress party or gandhi parivaar ke prati apni majboot nishtha rakhi
 He also wrote that 'I never imagined that i would need to write a letter to tell you the decisions related to my life
 teen dashakon se bhi zyada ho gaye, hamaare bich sambandh itane pragadh hai ki mere or aapke bich kabhi koi diwaar nahin rahi
 i always considered you as my ideal
 mere parivaar or aapke parivaar main kabhi koi paraayaapan nahin rahaa
 We connected with each other with selfless spirit
 sukh-dukh, raajnneetik, gaiyr raajnneetik sabhi paristhitiyon main ham ek duusare ke hiton ke liye tatasth khadey rahe
 You gave me a lot of love and hospitality
 maine bhi aapke pyaar kaa sammaan karte hue barabari se har pratikul paristhiti main aapkaa saath diya
 When Jogi, who had the highest allegiance to my husband and the Gandhi family, broke away from the Congress after being humiliated and formed his new party, i kept the Congress and Gandhi family above my family and served the Congress party
 'patr main renu jogi ne likhaa he, 'jogi ji kii nai party banane ke baad, unako rokane or apana raajnneetik hit saadhane ke liye unke virodhiyon ne mujhe nishaanaa banaaya
 i was persecuted in public life, yet i remained silent
 mere khilaaf congress ke hi ke netaaon ne jhootha abhiyaan chalaaya, main chup rahi
 Misinformation was published, i kept quiet
 meraa pal pal apmaan kiya, mujhe baithkon main nahi bulaayaa, main chup rahi
 Removed me from the post of Deputy Leader in the House, i kept quiet
 sadan ke bheetar mujh par mere hi party ke logon ne tanj kase, main chup rahi
 My husband and son were maligned by bringing fake cds, i kept quiet
 main do varshon se nirantar apamaanit hoti rahi lekin kabhi bhi aapako ek shabd nahi bataaya, main chup rahi
 The party always endured silently for the benefit of the party
 ek kshan ke liye bhi mujhe aisa nahi laga ki aap mere saath nahin khadi hai
 i always kept my strong allegiance to the Congress party and the Gandhi family
 kabhi kisi ke dabaav main nahi ai
 She went ahead with the interests of her own family and worked for the Congress party, but perhaps destiny was somewhat different
 'renu jogi ne likhaa, 'ant main aakhir vahi hua jo congress ke hitaishi nahin balki jogi ji ke virdohi chaahate the
 The Kota assembly constituency which i brought up and served like my family was taken away from me today
 meri saralata, maasoomiyat, mere tyaag or nishtha ko jaanboojh kar ek shadyantr ke tahat dwesh, irshyaa or sankeern raajnneeti ke chashme se dekha gaya or aaj us shadyantr ko anjaam tak pahunchane, mere astitv ko mitaane kaa prayaas hua he
 Till now the talk was limited to my family, but today there has been an unethical and unjust act to remove me from my Kota residents
 'renu jogi ne aage likhaa, mujhe aapako suchit karte hue atyant dukh ho rahaa he ki party main ek nishthavan or varisht mahila kaaryakarta ke atmasamman or tyaag ko parakhane ke liye chhattisgarh pradesh congress party main na to vivek he or na hi koi vyakti
 Perhaps you are helpless, so you delayed in deciding the right and wrong

 He said that these are major cases of human rights violation and the local people there want the right to self-government
 congress sadsy daana rohrabaker ne kaha ki pakistan ko yah yaad rakhana chahie ki 1971 main kya hua tha
 Due to human rights violations and atrocities on the local people, East Pakistan came out of its hands, which later became known as Bangladesh
 khanij sampada se bharpoor baluchistan pakistan kaa sabase bada praant he, lekin uski aabaadi bahut kam he
 For the past several decades, there have been voices of rebellion demanding independence
 haalanki pakistani sena bal prayog ke jariye vidroh ke in swaron ko dabaati rahi he
 Addressing delegates to the US House, Rohrabaker said that when the people of Bangladesh wanted some independence from the Pakistani government and their government to control their lives in their own way, this demand was brutally suppressed
 or iskaa parinaam kya hua, log uth khadey hue bangladesh ke rup main khud ko aaazaad kara liya

 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav kii siyaasi jang fatah karne ke liye bijepi or congress ne puri takat jhonk di he
 While Congress and CM Siddaramaiah went on a masterstroke by giving separate religion status to the Lingayat community, considered the kingmaker of the state, the BJP is also trying to retain its traditional Lingayat vote
 pradhanmantri narendra modi landan se to bijepi adhyaksh amit shah bangaleru se lingayat card khilne kii ranneeti banaai he
 The 12th century marks the birth anniversary of Basavanna, the philosopher and greatest social reformer of the Lingayat community
 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ke tahat bijepi is maukey ko apane haathon se nikalne nahin dena chaahati he
 PM Modi tweeted from London and said, i salute the occasion of the birth anniversary of Lord Basaveshwara
 hamaare itihaas or samskruti main unka vishesh sthaan he
 His emphasis on social harmony, brotherhood, unity and empathy always inspires us
 bhagwaan basavesheshwar ne hamaare samaaj ko ek kiya or gyaan ko mahatv diya
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has arrived in London to attend the Commonwealth Summit
 modi landan kii jameen se lingaytasamudaay kaa dil jeetne kii kavayad kar rahe hai
 The social reformer of the Lingayat community near London's Thames River will pay tribute to the statue of Basavanna (also known as Lord Basaveshwara)
 ye kaarykram da basavesheshwar foundation dwaara yojit kiya ja rahaa he
 The Basaveshwara statue, set up in the Albert Embankment, is not only the first statue to be unveiled by an Indian Prime Minister in Britain, but also the first ideological statue approved by the British Cabinet around Parliament
 basavesheshwar foundation britain kii adhyaksh niraj patil hai
 This exercise of PM Modi is being linked with the Karnataka assembly elections
 darasal karnataka main lingayat samudaay kaa 17 fisadi vot he
 The original vote bank of the BJP has been considered
 lekin congress ne unhen apane paale main laane ke liye unki saalon puraani alag dharm kii maang ko maanakar bijepi ko baikfoot par kar diya tha
 PM Modi and BJP President Amit Shah are trying to compensate for this
 samaaj sudhaarak basavanna kii jayanti ke maukey par amit shah karnataka pahunch rahe hai
 They will stay in the state for two days
 shah bangaleru ke basavanna kii murti kii pratimaa par jaaenge
 Thereafter, in the evening, Lingayats will address a program of the community
 shah lingayat lekhak chidanand kii murti par maalyarpan karenge
 After this, a Dalit will also meet with the writer
 lingayat samudaay kaa raajnneeti conectionuttar bharat hi nahin balki dakshin kii raajnneeti main bhi jati or dharm kii buniyaad par siyaasi tanabana buna jaataa he
 In the politics of Karnataka, the Lingayat community is considered a king maker
 lingayat ke daur main congress kaa majboot votbank rahaa he, lekin1989 main jab congress kii sarkaar bani to rajeev gandhi ne ek vivaad ke chalate tab ke siem virendra patil ko pad se hataa diya
 This move of the Congress aroused a sense of resentment in the Lingayat community and he left the Congress and supported the bjp's Ramakrishna Hegde
 hegade ke nidhan ke baad bies yediurppa lingayaton ke netaa bane
 BJP came to power in Karnataka in 2008 through Yeddyurappa
 mahaj teen saal yediurppa siem rahe, lakin teen saal ke baad bijepi ne unhen siem ke pad se hataa diya
 The BJP also played the stakes of the Congress
 yediurppa ko hataaya to lingayak samudaay kaa ne bijepi se bhi munh mode liya
 As a result, the BJP lost 2013
 karnataka kii raajnneeti main lingayat samudaay kaa hameshaa se hi khyaal rakhaa jaataa rahaa he
 If the Congress gave separate religion status to bring Lingayat into its fold, then BJP again put forward Yeddyurappa's face
