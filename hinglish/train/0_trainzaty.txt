 They should be caught
 sirf forbs kii suchi main hone yaa arbapati hone se koi fark nahin padataa

 iske baad meghavaal ne sansad main ek darjan se zyada baar yah maamla uthaaya
 He says, "under the Right to Education Act, the government asked children up to fifth to teach in their mother tongue
 par rajasthan main maatrubhaasha he kahaan?’ ve maanate hai ki maatrubhaasha main chote bachche acchhee tarah samajhenge
 But before enacting such a law, the government should think about Rajasthani language
 vaise, pech or bhi hai
 The Reserve Bank of India has said that there is no longer a place to print another language on the rupee
 lekin note par to abhi bhi sari manyata praapt bhashaaen kahaan chap rahi hai? sangh lok seva ayog kii suniye
 He does not have the knowledge to prepare the paper in the examinations to be conducted
 maharishi phir tokate hai, ‘jaipur or jodhpur vishvavidhyalay ke paper kaise taiyaar hote hai?’ itani samrudh bhashaa ke aage ye pech itane bhi uljhe hue nahin hai, basharte koi sulajhane main dilchaspee dikhaae
 An author of 87 stories, Vijayadan Detha (bijji), a writer for 600 stories and his own book Phulwari, speaks a bit about his 58-year-long experience in Rajasthani literature: 'only politicians can save this rich language by getting constitutional status
 ’ detha kii maane to rajasthani america jaise paraaye desh main bhashaa kii manyata ko lekar sangharsh kar rahe hai jabaki unke khud ke desh main ye bhashaa paraai he
 Here comes another complaining voice of Rajasthani cinema
 filmkaar-abhinayta shiris kumaar kehete hai ki jab 200 ru
 If Shah Rukh Khan is sold, then who would like to see Shirish Kumar or other Rajasthani films? Gehlot government of the state has not only taken away the rights of Rajasthani films by making 100% tax free of all types of cinema, but has also promoted pornography
 ’khayr, centre sarkaar bhale hi karodon logon kii bhashaa samajhane kii koshish na kare lekin akhbaar or sthaneey news channel jarur uski ahmiyat ko samaj gaye hai
 In order to bring interestingness in the news and reach the hearts of Rajasthanis, they have started serving typical Rajasthani words in their news
 itivi rajasthan rajasthani bhashaa se jude kai kaarykram prasaarit kar rahaa he
 The head of this channel, Jagdishchandra, also says, "the government should accord respectable status to Rajasthani language keeping in view the sentiments of crores of people
" ’mobile companiyaan bhi rajasthani main graahakon tak pahunch rahi hai
 While Custumar Care is talking to customers in Rajasthani language, songs, callertunes and ringtones of the same language are also playing well
 jarurat he sarkaar ko karodon logon kii bhashaa samajhane kii, taaki netaaon or matadaataaon main apanaayat bani rahe

 An important reason behind convening the meeting was that if Lalu Prasad Yadav is sentenced to more than three years, then what will be the party's strategy, under whose leadership the party will be pushed forward
 iske liye prakhand str se lekar rajya str ke netaaon or kaaryakartaaon kaa baari jamaavada hoga, jisamen party ke 80 vidhayak or saansad bhi shaamil honge
 If the verdict on Lalu Prasad Yadav comes on tomorrow i

 saath hi unhone kaha ki tejasvi prasad yadav ko hamane netaa maan liya he or saal 2020 main sab kuch unheen ke netritv main hoga
 Jagdanand Singh says that in the year 2020, the Rashtriya Janata Dal Alliance will form the government and Tejashwi Yadav will be our Chief Minister
 unhone kaha ki mananeey nyaayadhish ko yah bataanaa chahie ki kol kisne kiya tha, tab ham log kuch bol paaenge
 Jagadanand Singh also said that in the same case if someone gets a bail and punishes someone else, then what is wrong in asking these questions
 jagadanand singh ne yah bhi kaha ki lalu ji ke jail jane se hamaari party or majboot hogi, kamjor nahin
 He said that if someone's intention is to weaken our party, then his intention will not be fulfilled, this case has been going on since 1996
 hamari party kii vichaardhaara kabhi kamjor nahin hogi, hamaari party bhagodon kii party nahin he, ham sab ekajute hai
 Jagdanand Singh said that both the party and the opposition are in the process of preparing for the year 2019 and the thought stream of our party will not be weak

 He said that it looks strange
 pehle aisa nahin hota tha
 Decision was also heard on the day it was dated, but now a new series has started in which alphabetical and what happens
 bataa den ki 23 disambar ko argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav ko devgarh koshagaar se avaidh nikasi ke maamle main doshi qaraar diya gaya tha
 After that, he was to be sentenced on January 3, so RJD held a meeting on January 6 so that by then the verdict on Lalu Prasad Yadav would be announced and after that the party would decide the future strategy, but it did not happen and maybe this too It is feared that this decision should not be postponed till Monday

 BJP has taken an aggressive stand on Shinde's statement
 bijepi ne pradhanmantri se scindia ko barkhaast karne kii maang kii he
 Apart from this, BJP says that the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi should apologize on this issue
 somvaar ko bijepi ke varisht netaa ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki scindia ne sabhi hindooon kaa apmaan kiya he
 Terrorism has no religion, so BJP never used the term Muslim terrorism
 saath hi bijepi ne scindia ke bayaan ke khilaaf 24 janvari ko bijepi ne deshbhar main virodh pradarshan karne kaa elaan kiya he
 On the other hand, Kalyan Singh thundered as soon as he joined BJP and heard the Congress standing up for Shinde's statement
 unhone jor dete hue kaha ki hindu kabhi aatankwaadi nahin ho sakate
 The government of the Center and UP promote terrorism for votes
 kalyaan singh ne pradhanmantri or sonia gandhi se scindia ke bayaan ke liye maafee maangane ke liye kaha or salaah diya ki is tarah ke bayaan ke liye scindia ko paagalakhaane bheja janaa chahie
 JDU has also strongly objected to the statement of Home Minister Shinde
 party adhyaksh sharad yadav ne kaha ki grahamantri par desh kii suraksha kii zimmedaari hoti he, unke munh aisi baaten shobhaa nahin detii
 The Sangh has also hit back at Home Minister Shinde for his statement on Hindu terrorism
 sangh ke netaa ram madhav ne aaj twit kar ke susheel kumaar scindia par talkh tippanee kii he
 He has written that terrorist organizations like jamaat-ud-dawa are now congratulating the Home Minister
 scindia ab asli aatankwaadiyon ke chahete ban gaye hai
 On the other hand, the Congress has come down in support of Shinde
 kamalnath ne kaha ki party puri tarah grahamantri ke saath he
 According to Kamal Nath, BJP is plotting to divert attention from the issue
 digvijay samet tamaam netao ne kaha ki scindia ne kuch bhi galat nahin kaha he
 Significantly, on Sunday, BJP and Sangh strongly attacked Shinde's statement of Hindu terrorism
 bijepi ne ye bhi kah rakhaa he ki scindia ke bayaan par sonia or rahul ko maafee maangani padegi, varanaa iske gambhir nattejey honge
 However, Sushil Shinde himself has retracted his statement and says that he did not mean Hindu terrorism but saffron terrorism

 vah sirf apane tote ke bare main soch rahaa tha
 The court's judgment came apart, Buckner did not receive bail and the court directed him to seek custody
 court ke jajment se baknar jitna dukhi nahin tha, usase zyada dukhi tha apane tote ke bhavishya ko lekar
 He was taking her name again and again, then understanding the talk of Buckner, the security officer of Washington County Sharif, went out to meet the parrot where he saw the parrot sitting on a tree

 He was just thinking about his parrot

 What would you say if a 'birthday boy' dies in the fun of the birthday party? One such video is becoming very fast viral on social media
 video main dikh rahaa he ki ek kamare main zamin par gire ek ladke ko uske dost laat-ghunson se peet rahe hai
 The boys appear to be in a joking mood, placing a cake on the table nearby
 pitayee ke baad ladkaa kuch karahata hua sa khadaa hota he or video khatm ho jaataa he
 It is being said that the boy being beaten in the video was his birthday
 doston ne 'berthde bamp' ke naam par uski itani pitayee kar di ki uski maut ho gai
 'birthday bump' means that whose birthday it is, people greet it with a light dab in a joke
 virendra sahvaag,news channel TV 9sahitkai logon nene is video ko yahi kehete hue share kiya ki is ladke kii maut ho gai he
 Thousands more people shared this video as soon as they saw it and reacted to this death caused by the laughing joke
 india today anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne apni jaanch main paaya kii ladke kii maut kaa daawa galat he
 India Today spoke directly to the boy and he is absolutely right
 sahvaag ke is video ko lekar kiye gaye twit par raghuraaj singh naam ke ek twitor yuzar ne coment kiya ki ye phek news he
 Raghuraj wrote that the boy who killed them was a student of his college and nothing happened to him
 iske baad virendra sahvaag ne apana twit delit kar diya
 To find out the truth of this video, we started a search for the same Raghuraj, who, in response to Sehwag's tweet, claimed that the boy belonged to his college
 hamen pataa chalaa ki raghuraaj purv soviet rus ke ek desh kirgistan main padhata he
 We tried to contact Raghuraj Singh but he did not reply to our message
 lekin raghuraaj kii fasebuk profile par hi hamen ek group photo mil gai, jisamen raghuraaj ke saath usee college main padhne vaale tamaam log maujuud the
 One of these people was Deepak Anjana
 ye log kirgistan kii rajdhani bishkek ke ek college main padhate hai
 We contacted Deepak Anjana and we had a conversation with him
 deepak ne mana ki viral video main jis ladke kii pitayee ho rahi he wo unka saathi he
 But the news of his death is completely wrong
 deepak kii madad se hamaari sidhe us ladke se bhi baat ho gai jiske maut kaa daawa tamaam log kar rahe hai
 He told that this incident is of December 2018, when it was his birthday and friends did this to him
 jab se unki maut kii khabar ke saath video viral ho gai he tab se wo kaaphi tanaav main he, kyonki college main bhi isaki chaanbin ho rahi he
 At his request not to make his identity public, we are not disclosing his name and his college
 pitayee khaane vaale ladke ne khud apni taraf se bhi soshal media par logon ko bataaya tha ki maut kii khabar bebuniyaad he
 In the case of this video, Virender Sehwag and others may have been deceived
 lekin isamen koi shaq nahin ki is tarah kaa mazaaq naa sirf khatarnaak he balki jaanaleva bhi sabit ho saktaa he

 Amit Shah said, Manish Tiwari and Shashi Tharoor and others, citing article 14, termed the bill as non-constitutional
 rizanable clacification ke aadhaar par kanoon banane se koi roak nahin he
 The good thing was that the division of the country was not done on the basis of religion

 " Yajidi religion has absorbed the activities of many other religions
 isamen islam, isiyat or kuch duusare dharmon ke mili jule niyam hai
 Yazidi believes in one God and believes that his seven angels help him in the world
 mor ke rup main malik touse unamem sabase ahm he
 Followers of Yajidi religion worship the Sun five times a day
 dopaher kii puja laalish pahadiyon kii taraf munh karke kii jaati he, jahaan unka pavitra majaar he
 This place is a symbol of that
 duniya bhar main kareeb 8 lakh yajidi hai, jinamein se zyaadaatar nineveh praant main pahadiyon ke paas rahete hai
 Kurdish-speaking Yazidis had to flee countries like Syria and Turkey since 1990
 unamem se kai ne ab europe main panaah lee he
 IS is a completely Muslim terrorist organization, so these people refuse to consider Yazidi as Muslim
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki iees ke log yajidiyon se nafrat karte hai
 There are around 8 lakh Yazidis worldwide, most of whom live near the hills in Nineveh Province
 kurd bhashaa bolne vaale yajidiyon ko 1990 ke baad se syria or turki jaise deshon se bhaagna padaa
 Many of them have now taken refuge in Europe
 aies puri tareeke se muslim aatanki sanghathan he, isliye ye log yajidi ko musalmaan maanane se manaa karte hai
 Perhaps this is the reason why people of IAS hate Yazidis

 ' (input: bhashaa) An interesting story was seen in the match played on Monday between Rajasthan Royals (RR) and Delhi Capitals (DC) at Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur
 is match main dilli capitals kii pari ke 16wein over main tej gendbaaj jophra archer kii gend bels se takaraai lekin bels nahin giri
 Actually, the 16th over of the Delhi Capitals innings was being thrown
 gendbaaj the jophra archer
 At that time Delhi 15
 5 over main 2 wicket khokar 151 ran bana liye the or dilli ko jeet ke liye 25 gendon main 41 ran kii darkaar thi or ballebaaji chhod par prithvi shaw khel rahe the
 After this Jofra Archer bowled the last ball of the over at a speed of 150 KMPH and she came out after touching the stumps, after which the light of the bells lit but the bells did not fall
 dhaval kii gend par bhi aisa hi hua tha
 
 
 This is not the first time in the IPL when the bails have not fallen even after being hit on the wicket
 isse pehle isi maidan par rajasthan ke gendbaaj dhaval kulkarni kii gend stump par lagi thi or bels nahin giri thim
 Actually, the 21st match of IPL 12 was played between Rajasthan Royals (RR) and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur

 That ball of Dhawal Kulkarni hit the stumps, but the bails did not fall
 jisase ballebaaj kris lin out hone se batch gaye
 In this match, Chris Lynn scored 50 runs in 32 balls
 is dauraan is ballebaaj ne 6 chauke or 3 chakke lagaae
 Dhoni avoided being bowled when he did not fall, Dhoni saw a similar incident in the match between Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals in this season
 is sijan ke 12wein match mahendra singh dhoni rajasthan royles ke jophra archer kii gend par bold ho gaye the

 us over kii chauthi gend par aisa kuch hua ki sabhi dang rah gaye
 Dhoni was absolutely defensive, but the ball rolled into his stump
 dhoni bhaagyashaalee rahe ki bels nahin giri
 In the current season of IPL, Dhoni dismissed KL Rahul during a match between Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Kings XI Punjab (KXIP)
 lekin, gend stump par lagane ke baavjood bels nahin giriin
 Ravindra Jadeja tried to take a single by pushing KL Rahul to the on-side side and got out of the crease, only after Dhoni behind the wicket, showed the cleverness and quickness, hitting the ball on the stumps
 dhoni kaa thro stump par to laga lekin, bels stamps se neeche nahin giri
 As soon as the ball hit the stumps, the bails got burnt but did not fall below the stumps
 aise main somvaar ko hue is vaakye ke baad ab cricket premi gend ke bels par lagane ke baad ballebaaj ko out dene ke paksh main baat karne lage hai

 On 18 March, Reliance Communications (rcom) paid 550 crore (rs 576 crore including interest) to Sweden's telecom equipment maker Ericsson

 However, now it seems that Janata Dal United (JDU) leaders are determined to respond to every tweet and statement of Giriraj Singh

 CM Nitish Kumar, who has been insulting the public sentiment by robbing the mandate in broad daylight, should tell whether the same government had formed an immoral government without policy, principle and thought by insulting the mandate for this day? How did Bihar benefit from this? shekhavati ke gangstaron kii kahani kisi film se kam nahin he
 Gangwar of Gangs of Shekhawati has been an emotional war, whose biggest character emerged as Anandpal Singh
 is gangvaar main ab tak darjanon logon kii maut ho chuki he
 These gangsters used to be friends with each other, but there was a fight between two gang members in connection with the business and they keep dropping the corpses of the gangs of other gangs to avenge the death of their close ones
 in badmaashon ke bich jab bhi gangvaar hui he
 He lost himself and then vowed to take revenge on his pyre and attacked another gang

 Due to further fights in the same business, a dispute between Raju Aashiqui and Balveer Banooda took place
 us samay dukaan kaa puraa kaam banooda kaa saalaa gopal dekha karata tha
 The rivalry between the two increased so much that Raju Aashishti along with his companions had beaten Balveer Banuda's brother-in-law Gopal to death
 chita par khai badale kii kasamayahin se shuru hua donon guton ke bich badale kaa khel
 After killing his brother-in-law, Balveer Banooda vowed to avenge Raju typical on his pyre
 raju theth se alag hokar balvir banooda kamjor ho gaya tha
 He enlisted the help of his Nagaur partner Anandpal to strengthen the faction
 tab anandapal padhai-likhaai ke baad teacher or fouj kii naukari kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha
 Together with the very fearless Anandpal, he started the liquor and mining business and at the same time he strengthened the group to keep the fire of revenge alive
 phogawatt ne donon gang ke bich banaai shaantikaphi samay se balvir banooda raju theth ke gang se badla lene kii yojana bana rahaa tha, lekin raju theth ke khaas dost gopal phogawat ne use samajhaayaa bujhaayaa
 Politically, Gopal Fogawat had a good reputation in Shekhawati
 gopal phogawat hi tha, jisane is ilaake main guton ke bich shanti banane kii koshish kii thi
 He had also divided the areas of Raju typical and Balveer Banuda, but his inclination was more towards Raju typical
 balvir banooda ko isi baat se zyada samasya thi
 Banooda completed Fogawat by sacking him in half-time in June 2006, in the month of June 2006, he got the information of Raju typical man Gopal Phogawat
 use pataa chalaa ki vah sikar ke bazaar main kisi tailor kii dukaan par akelaa ja rahaa he
 Seeing the opportunity, the Banuda gang roasted Gopal Phogawat with Surrey Bazaar bullets
 is tarah gopal banooda kii aadhi kasam to puri ho gai, lekin raju theth ko maarna uske liye baaki tha
 The equation changed from the death of Phogawat to the murder of Gopal Phogawat changed all the equations in this field
 uski antim yatra main raju theth ne balvir banooda ko khatm karne kaa pran liya tha
 After losing his partner and special friend, Raju was left with only one purpose in the life of the archetype and that was to eliminate Balveer Banooda
 haalanki raju theth jaanata tha ki anandapal kaa saath hone kii vajah se ye kaam uske liye aasaan nahin tha
 He started waiting for the chance
 isi bich donon guton ke bich ek duusare ke gargon par hamale bhi chalate rahe
 Due to other occupations and many cases of murder, now the police was also behind them
 lihaaja kuch saalon tak donon gang ke badmaash underground ho gaye
 a fire of revenge in 2012; In 2012, when Raju Adarsh, Anandpal and Balveer Banuda were arrested, the revenge fire started smoldering again
 balvir banooda ne apane khaas aadmi subhash baraal ko sikar jail main band raju theth ko maarane kaa jimmaa saunpa
 Subhash Baral was then lodged in Sikar Jail, where he was sent weapons
 26 janvari 2013 ko subhash baraal ne raju theth par hamalaa kar diya, lekin kismat se goli raju theth ke jabade main lagi or wo batch gaya
 In this way, Raju Pratishmati became completely stung by this attack on himself in his swearing-in
 ab uske liye balvir banooda auranandapalase badla lenaa behad jaruri ho gaya tha
 After Raju Aashiqui came to jail, he made his brother Omprakash alias Oma the commander of the gang
 isi dauraan balvir banooda or anandapal kaa gang bikaner jail main band tha
 Incidentally, Jai Prakash, the brother-in-law of Omprakash Aashish and his friend Ramprakash, were also lodged in Bikaner jail
 raju theth kii yojana par donon ko jail main hathiyaar bhijwaaye gaye or 24 july 2014 ko bikaner jail main balvir banooda or anandapal par hamalaa hua, jisamen balvir banooda kii maut ho gai
 Then Anandpal vowed to kill Raju typical, thus an oath of Raju typical was fulfilled, but after the death of his Aziz friend, Anandpal vowed to kill Raju typical
 anandapal ke gang kaa jimmaa uske bhai vicky ke paas chalaa gaya
 Vicky had escaped from parole in a murder case a while back, while his brother Omprakash was running the gang of Raju Aashiqui
 phir unhen pataa chalaa ki donon guton ne ek duusare gut kii supaari de rakhi thi
 Raju typical has given Anandpal's betel nut to absconding miscreant Shankar in the Ramkishan Sihag murder case of Bikaner
 in badmaashon ke bich gangvaar kii daastaan aapasi ranjish or kaarobaar se adhik badale kii kahani he
 There is a battle in which killing is nothing but revenge
 ye ek aisa antaheen silsilaa he, jisamen jab saare kirdaaron kaa khaatmaa nahin hoga goliyaan chalani thamengi nahin
 Then this gangwar of Lady Don Anuradha's banged Entryrajasthan also witnessed the destruction of Lady Don for the first time
 angreji skool main padhi kai bhashaa bolne vaali emb ladi don anuraadhaa choudhary anandapal ke kareeb ai or dekhte-dekhte hi aparaadh jagat par chaa gai
 Anuradha was caught in a blockade during the kidnapping of a businessman and is currently lodged in Jaipur's Central Jail
 us par hatya, apharan or marpet jaise darjanon gambhir maamle chal rahe hai
 In the world of crime, Anuradha had a different status
 One can guess what Anuradha holds in the world of crime by seeing the enormous security of Anuradha, who lives in T-shirt and shirt with jeans pants
 jaipur ke ek bade parivaar kii rahane vaali anuraadhaa ajmer ke sophia skool kii padhi likhi he or farrate se angreji bolti he
 But the desire to make quick money and a life full of luxury brought Anuradha into the world of crime
 anandapal gang kii number tu ban gai anuradhnuradhaa sikar main anandapal singh ke kareeb ai or dekhte-dekhte anandapal singh ke gang kii number do ban gai
 Due to being good in writing, the task of planning from court to crime to crime also remained on Anuradha
 anandapal ke jail jane ke baad gang kii jimmedaari anuraadhaa par aa gai thi
 One day when a businessman in Sikar did not give extortion money to Anuradha, she was kidnapping him
 raste main police ne nakebandi kar thi or isi dauraan uski gaadi kharaab ho gai, jisase vah police kii pakad main aa gai
 He has since been lodged in a jail in Jaipur and is facing dozens of criminal prosecutions in Sikar, Nagaur, Bikaner and Ajmer
 darasal rajasthan main chal rahe is gangvaar ne kisaanon or vyapaariyon samet aam logon main dar paidaa kar diya he
 The rounds of mass firing and murders have questioned the functioning of the police as well as the government
 aksar congress or bijepi ke netaa ek duusare par in gangstaron se milane jail main jane kaa aarope lagaate rahete hai
 The leaders of both the parties are accused of taking support of these gangsters to get votes in the elections

 We have even announced that if AAP government is formed in Delhi, we will get these cases investigated
 narendra modi: 'baar-baar logon kii ankhon main dhul jhonkar koi safalataa praapt nahin kar saktaa
 'arvind Kejriwal: You are right

 Mistake also happens to us sometimes
 narendra modi: 'hamaare liye mudda sirf vikaas he

 The Bharatiya Janata Party Parliamentary Board meeting lasted till late night on Friday before the announcement of Lok Sabha elections 2019
 teen ghante tak hue manthan main 75 saal se zyada umr ke netaaon ko chunaav ladaane par gambhir vimarsh kiya gaya
 According to sources, the party is in a mood to give rest to senior leaders LK Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi, Shanta Kumar and BC Khanduri in the upcoming elections
 is baithak main pradhanmantri narendra modi, amit shah, sushamaa swaraj, arun jetali, nitin gadakari, rajnath singh, jepi nadda, thavarchand gahalot, ram laal or shivaraj singh chouhan maujuud the
 All these leaders are members of the bjp's highest decision making parliamentary board
 baithak ke baad party sutron ne bataaya ki 75 saal se zyaada umr vaale netaaon ko bijepi tikat de sakati he lekin unhen sarkaar yaa party main koi jimmedaari nahin di jaaegi
 However, high party sources say that this formula for giving tickets to winning leaders over the age of 75 years will not apply to senior leaders LK Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi, Shanta Kumar and BC Khanduri
 yani ki party in netaaon ko loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main aaraam de sakati he
 In the parliamentary board meeting, there was a wide-ranging discussion on the election of leaders above 75 years of age, Rajya Sabha mps and mlas in the Lok Sabha elections
 party ne pichley 5 rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav main kai aise candidt ko tikat die the jinaki umr 75 saal se zyada thi, lekin unki chunaav jeetne kii kshamta zyada thi
 The party's decision not to give tickets to leaders above 75 years of age was changed by making Yeddyurappa the chief ministerial candidate in the Karnataka elections
 loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaariyon ko lekar pradhanmantri ke saath bhaajapa netritv kii yah pehali badi baithak thi
 In this meeting, a wide consideration was given for setting standards for the candidates, taking stock of the electoral atmosphere and the status of opposition alliances
 cat sakate hai maujuuda saansadon ke tiktasutron ke anusaar bhaajapa netritv anti inakambency ko rokane ke liye kai maujuuda saansadon kaa tikat kaatane kii taiyaari main he
 On this pretext, the party wants to bring young and new candidates to the public
 party ke andruni survey main bhi vyapak badlaav kii baat saamne ai he
 In this meeting, the party discussed the political and social developments of the last three months
 iske alaava bhavishya main party ke kya kaarykram rahenge, chunaav prachaar kii kya ruparekha rahegi is par bhi manthan kiya gaya
 Recently, the changed atmosphere was also discussed after bjp's defeat in the assembly elections in three states
 sutron ke anusaar party netritv kaa maananaa he ki pulavama kii aatanki ghatana ke baad aatankwaad ke khilaaf sarkaar kii karrwai se maahaul main sakaaratmak badlaav aayaa he
 Along with this, the party will focus on nationality in campaigning, camps of terrorist organizations in Pakistan, terrorism, Balakot air strike
 iske alaava vikaas, modi sarkaar kii garib kalyaan yojanaayen bhi chunaav prachaar main ahm agenda rahegaa
 For the Lok Sabha elections 2019, an alliance between the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh is believed to be fixed, in which the Congress does not seem to be a part at the moment
 sapa-basapa kaa yah kadam congress ko nahin bha rahaa he
 The state president of the party Raj Babbar seems angry with the alliance of the two parties
 unhen lagata he ki congress ke shaamil na hone se bijepi ko phayda hoga
 Talking to Aaj Tak in Prayagraj, Raj Babbar said that if there is a grand alliance between SP and BSP without Congress, then it will directly benefit BJP
 isliye in donon partiyon ko tay karnaa he ki vah bijepi ko phayda pahunchaana chaahati hai yaa bijepi ko haraana chaahati hai
 The Congress state president said that these two parties had contested elections alone in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, but if it had been in the fray with the Congress, the BJP would have lost even more seats
 raaj babbar ne sapa or basapa se naaraazgi dikhaate hue kaha ki yah donon partiyon ko tay karnaa he ki wo kya kadam uthaati hai
 Raj Babbar was asked whether the Congress would contest all the Lok Sabha seats of Uttar Pradesh alone
 is par unhone kaha ki 9 janvari ko congress ke sabhi rajyon ke pramukhon ke saath hone vaali party adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii baithak ke baad hi tay ho sakegaa
 However, Raj Babbar says that if the BJP has to be defeated then all the parties will have to fight elections together or else BJP will benefit from fighting separately
 haalanki sapa-basapa gathbandhan amethi or raibareli kii seat congress ke liye chhod sakati hai
 In such a situation, the Congress will directly compete with the BJP in both these seats
 jabaki baaki siton par use bijepi ke saath-saath mahagathbandhan ke ummidavaaron se bhi do-do haath karne honge

 vitt mantri arun jetali jahaan kai morchon par aam aadmi ko raahat denge, to kai jagahon par vah arthvyavastha kii khatir kade faisle bhi le sakate hai, lekin iskar chhot kii seemaa badhaane kii baat lagaataar ho rahi he
 2 at the moment
 5 lakh rupeki is seemaa ko 3 lakh rupee kiye jane kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 Although this income tax exemption limit can be up to Rs 5 lakh, but it is important that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley listen to his heart
 2014 main kii thi ye maangadrasalmodi sarkarmen lagaataar 5veen baar bajet pesh kar rahe vitt mantri arun jetali ne 2014 main loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan khud yah maang uthaai thi
 He had said in a program that the income tax exemption limit should be increased from 2 lakh to 5 lakh
 unhone kaha tha ki isse 3 karod se bhi zyada logon ko phayda pahonchega
 Demand is not met, the demand that Jaitley was making as BJP leader, after coming to power, he himself has not been able to fulfill this demand yet
 pichley 4 saalon ke dauraan na sirf mahangaai main ijapha hua he, balki iske saath hi aam logon kaa rahan-sahan bhi mahangaa hua he
 2 for the Jaitley common man to the income tax exemption limit in his last 4 budgets
 5 lakh rupee tak le ja sake hai 
 However, they have definitely cut the tax rate
 tex rate main kii katautee2017 ke bajet main unhone 2
 The tax rate was reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent for those with income between 5 lakh and 5 lakh
 isaki badaulat tex main milane vaali chhot ke boote in logon ko yaa to jiro tex bharna padataa he yaa phir unhen maujuuda tex dendaree kaa 50 fisadi bharna padataa he
 Explain that tax exemption is given under section 87A of the Income Tax Act
 iskar chhot kii seemaa badhaane kii uthati rahi he mangamodi sarkaarake satta main aane ke baad bhi kai baar ye maang uthati rahi he ki iskar chhot kii seemaa ko 5 lakh tak kiya jaae
 Jaitley is going to present the 5th year budget of this government
 iske saath hi 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle unke paas ye aakhri mauka he ki vah jo maang duusari partiyon se chunaav ke dauraan kar rahe the, us vaade ko khud puraa karen
 This time the income tax exemption limit will be increased? Now it has to be seen whether Finance Minister Arun Jaitlykhud meets the demand which was raised in 2014
 agar jetali apane dil kii baat sunakar faisla lenge, to iskar chhot kii seemaa badhaakar jetali na sirf apni hi uthaai maang ko puraa karenge, balki aam aadmi ko ek bada tohfa bhi milegaa

 6 agast 2016 ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha tha, 'gauraksha ke naam par kuch logon ne jo apni dukaane kholkar baith gaye hai, mujhe itnaa gussa aata he
 Cow is different, cow servant is different
 maine dekha he ki kuch log jo puri raat antisoshal activity karte hai, lekin din main gaurakshak kaa chola pahan lete hai
 i request the State Governments to prepare dossiers of those who become guards, 70-80 percent will be those who do coworkers who do not accept the society, but to protect themselves from their evils, they wear cowards
 
 or agar sachmuch main wo gausevak hai to main unase aagrah karata hum ki ek kaam kiijie, sabase zyada gaayen katl ke kaaran nahin, plastic khaane se marati hai, to aap kam se kam gaay ko plastic khaanaa band karvaa den, logon ko plastic phenkna band kara den to vah bhi badi guseva hogi
 Therefore, volunteering is not meant to harass others
 ' gau raksha yaa gau hatya ke sandarbh main do dhai saal main jitani bhi bahasein hui hai unamem sarkaar kii taraf se sabase bada or pramanik bayaan yahi he ki 70-80 fisadi gau rakshak farji hote hai
 It is expected that the Prime Minister will still hold his opinion
 hamen yah nahin maaloom ki pradhanmantri kii is apil kaa rajya sarkaron par kya asar padaa
 At least in the context of the current controversy, only the Rajasthan Home Minister can tell whether he has made a file of fake cow guards or shop owners in the name of cow protection on the appeal of the Prime Minister
 rajasthan ke grahamantri gulabchand kataaria ji hi bataa sakate hai ki hindu chaowkee kya he
 What law is this made of? hindu chaowkee kaa daaroga koun he, espi koun he, esaspi koun he or diji hindu chaowkee koun he
 We are not saying this, but popular BJP MLA from Alwar, Gyan Dev Ahuja ji has said
 hindu chowkiyaan kis kanoon se bani hai yaa hindu naam rakh lenaa hi kanoon he
 The public is crowded and there is a mob system
 ye sunakar lagegaa ki ahuja ji janata ko bhadkaa rahe hai
 No, they are not doing this
 unhone bas yahi kaha ki janata to bheed he or bheed tantra he
 Rather Ahuja ji should be applauded for the fact that he has also said that the public should not be beaten
 aisi baat ke liye kanoon he
 After this poignant statement, he has also said that 'we have given instructions to all the Hindu outposts that have been built here, that we do not have to fight any kind of cow smugglers, they should be captured and handed over to the police
 ' iske liye bhi bhuri bhuri prashansa kii jaani chahie
 This is a positive aspect of his statement
 lekin hindu chaukiyon kii baat sunakar main chaunk gaya
 Does the Alwar police know of Hindu posts that such posts have been formed in Mewat
 mevaat haryana main he
 Alwar is in Rajasthan
 alvar ke vidhayak ne haryana ke mevaat main hindu chowkiyaan kyon banavaai hai
 Does the Haryana government know about Hindu posts? ye sab sawaal to banate hai
 At least Rajasthan Police should take seriously what Ahuja ji has said
 na bhi le to kam se kam apni kamiyon ko dur karnaa chahie
 If the Rajasthan Police had been doing a good job, it might not have been possible to build a Hindu post
 ek baar phir bataa rahaa hum ki ahuja ne kaha he ki 'puure mevaat main maine hindu chowkiyaan or gau raksha chowk banaaya he
 Police posts are not working so well
 ' Ahuji ji has said in his statement that the Home Minister has made six police posts for cow protection
 jo acha kaam nahin kar rahi hai
 We do not have any information about police posts for cow protection, this is our shortage
 kam se kam hindu chaowkee or gau raksha ke liye bani police chaukiyon ke bich tulanaatmak report to honi hi chahie thi
 Now you have a question as well as your own
 ham sabaki gaay main aasthaa he
 Many cows do not have the same faith as we do
 gaay main aasthaa hona, uski puja karnaa, shraddha rakhana bilkul thik or saamaanya baat he
 Good thing too
 aasthaa to anya kai chizon main he to kya uske liye ham kisi bheed ko anumati de sakate hai
 There was so much debate, everyone got statements, rallies were held, why the crowd is not stopping even after this
 agar aapako gau raksha ke naam par maar diye gaye pahalu khan kii maut se koi sahanubhuti nahin he, koi karunaa nahin he to mujhe usase bhi koi pareshaani nahin he
 If there is no regret towards the children of Aspect Khan
 lekin in logon ke prati to aap chintit honge hi
 These who are killing
 gusse main ho saktaa he inkaa bhi khud par bas na chalaa ho
 If the person who dies is only one, but if the two who kill are four, is it not a matter of concern? bheed main kisi ke haath koon se rang jaaen, koi durghatana ho jaae to kya aap in logon ke prati bhi chintit nahin honge, kya aapaki sahanubhuti in gau rakshakon se bhi nahin he
 We are not verifying the video but asking a question
 bheed main koun he
 Our people are there
 agar inke sar koon kaa ilzaam aata he to kya ye acchhee baat he
 Suppose that in some other incident such a mob is killed, even if the police and politics save them, but will you be able to accept them among you
 kya gau raksha ke naam par ban rahi bheed ke saath khadey log is baat ko lekar chintit hai ki aisi ghatana ke baad unke bhavishya par kya asar padegaa
 These are all young boys
 mujhe puraa yakeen he ki inhen raaton ko neend nahin aegi
 The crime of murder sometimes comes back to life
 pareshaan karata he
 Therefore, we must be sympathetic to the violent mob
 is bheed main hamaare hi bich kaa koi he
 Touki tokki in passion and passion, it is fine to argue, but going beyond that, killing and beating someone and creating a situation that leads to death, i think you agree with me that this should not happen
 ham sabko is bheed kaa isliye virodh karnaa chahie kyonki is tarah kanoon apane haath main lene se koi hatyara ban saktaa he
 Such people are used by political parties
 unhen bahadur kahenge, jabanz kahenge phir jab gau raksha kaa topic raajnneetik rup se kamazor padegaa to unhen chhod denge
 The lives of these young people will be ruined
 haa agar inhen gaay kii seva kerani he to bilkul in naujavaanon kaa saath dena chahie
 They should be encouraged
 wo seva jo pradhanmantri ne inke liye kahi he
 The Prime Minister had said, "I request them to do one thing
 Most of the cows do not die due to slaughter, they die by eating plastic
" ab ye jo samaaj seva karnaa chaahate hai kam se kam gaay ko plastic khaanaa band karvaa den or plastic logon kaa phenkna band karvaa den to bhi bahut badi go-seva hogi
 'I have spoken about this only a few months old
 ab tay aapako karnaa he, aapke priy pradhanmantri kii baat sahi he, meri baat sahi he yaa us bheed kii baat sahi he
 Once you decide this, then i am sure that you will be ashamed of the death of Pehom Khan
 jo bhi ninda karne aayega wo agar magar kaa sahaara lekar is bheed ke saath khadaa nahin ho sakegaa
 SP of Alwar, Rahul Prakash has said that whether or not Gau was a smuggler, this does not lessen the blame of the attackers
 jin logon ne marpet kii he ve 302 ke tahat hamaare liye mulzim hai
 This is the statement of SP
 kya aap gau raksha ke naam par naujavaanon kii toli ko 302 yani hatya kaa mulzim banane kaa samarthan kar sakate hai
 Don't you think someone is playing with his life
 tippaniyan The driver, named Arjun, was driving the vehicle from which Pehlu Khan was unloaded
 kaha ja rahaa he ki bheed ne uskaa naam puch kar chhod diya
 Now if cow smuggling is a crime, is it not for Arjun? kya arjuna ko gaay kii taskari kii chhot he? kam se kam arjuna se poochtacha to honi hi chahie
 Well, he was hired by Pehlu Khan but when he drove a small truck from Jaipur, then the cow must have been seen
 pahalu khan ke saath uske do bete irshaad or aarif bhi gaye the
 How to say on TV but cow Muslims also raise
 musalmaan bhi gaay kaa doodh bechakar guzaaraa karte hai
 In this way, if someone is run over and killed on the basis of suspicion, then do you know that someday you are walking next to a cow, feeding something and the crowd will come and kill you? And was carrying, feeding some suspects
 jin par marpet ke ilzaam hai unhen pakadaney ke liye police ne teen special team banaai hai
 a reward of five-five thousand has been kept to apprehend the accused
 video or tasveeron ke aadhaar par police ne teen logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 But SP Rahul Prakash said that it is important to get a permit from the collector to be taken out of the state
 ho saktaa he unhen isaki jaankaree na ho
 Only because of this permit can anyone be declared a cow smuggler, while the buyer is buying from the municipal fair, coming with his slip
 NDTV kii reporter harsha kumari singh ne iske liye kai adhikariyon se baat karne kii koshish kii
 No one came on camera and could not tell how many people were given transit permits on Saturday, if there is a law as SP Sahib is saying then what arrangements were made for it at the fair
 har jagah of da record jawaab hi mila
 But Jaipur Mayor Ashok Lahoti responded on camera
 yah sab jaanch kaa vishay he
 The SP said that this does not reduce anyone's crime whether or not there was a cow smuggler
 vaise bhi pahalu khan ke maare jane se pehle 11 logon ko taskari ke aarope main pakadaa gaya he
 What law are Hindu posts made out of, or is it the law to keep a Hindu name? janata to bheed he or bheed tantra he
 It will be heard that Ahuja ji is provoking the public
 nahin aisa nahin kar rahe hai
 He simply said that the public is a crowd and there is a mob system
 balki ahuja ji kii is baat ke liye bhuri bhuri prashansa kii jaani chahie ki unhone yah bhi kaha he ki janata ko peetna nahin chahie
 There is a law for such a thing
 is garimamayi bayaan ke baad unhone yah bhi kaha he ki 'hamaare yahaan jo hindu chowkiyaan bani hai, un sabko hamane instrection diya he ki gau taskaron se kisi tarah kii marpet nahin kerani he, unako pakad karke police ke hawaale kar dena he
 'brownish brown praise should also be given for this
 ye unke bayaan kaa sakaaratmak pahalu he
 But i was shocked to hear the Hindu posts
 kya alvar police ko hindu chaukiyon kii jaankaree he ki puure mevaat main aisi chowkiyaan bani he
 Mewat is in Haryana
 alvar rajasthan main he
 Why did Alwar MLA build Hindu posts in Mewat, Haryana? kya haryana sarkaar ko hindu chaukiyon kii jaankaree he
 All these questions are formed
 ahuja ji ne jo kaha he use kam se kam rajasthan police ko gambhirtha se to lenaa hi chahie
 Even if not taken, we should at least overcome our shortcomings
 agar rajasthan police acha kaam kar rahi hoti to hindu chaowkee banane kii shaayad naubat hi nahin aati
 i am once again saying that Ahuja has said that 'I have built Hindu posts and Gau Raksha Chowk all over Mewat

 We are not verifying the video but asking a question
 bheed main koun he
 Our people are there

 ab laal bahadur shastri ke parivaar waalon ne bhi sarkaar se maang kii he ki shastri ji kii maut se judi filein saarvajanik kii jaaen
 Shastri's son Anil Shastri has said that when the file related to Subhash Chandra Bose can now be made public, then why not the file related to Shastriji's death? desh ke duusare pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri kii maut rahasyamay halaat main rus ke taashkand main 11 janvari 1966 ko ho gai thi
 He died after a Tashkent agreement with Pakistan
 1965 ke yuddh main bharat kii paak par vijay ke baad taatkaaleen pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri rus gaye the
 Anil Shastri says that at that time i was only 17 years old, but my mother had told that when Shastriji's body came to Delhi, then his face had turned blue and there were white spots near his eyes
 maine bhi khud dekha tha
 Mother also told her close friends that Shastri's death did not look natural, despite that no commission of inquiry was set up nor any post-mortem took place in Russia
 tippaniyan Not only this, Anil says that our suspicion was increased when it came to know that Shastri ji was placed 20 km from Tashkent where there was neither a bell in the room nor a telephone
 jabaki desh ke baaki pratinidhimandal ko taashkand main tehraaya gaya tha
 Not only this, an RTI in 2012 revealed that the government did not want to disclose the file related to Shastri ji because it threatened to deteriorate national security as well as relations with a country
 ab jabaki sarkaar pehali baar 1965 main pakistan par mili jeet kaa swarna janyati samaaroh manaa rahi to parivaar waalon ko ummid he ki shaayad modi sarkaar shastri ji kii maut se jude rahasy par se pardaa uthaae
 Lal Bahadur Shastri, the second Prime Minister of the country, died in mysterious circumstances on 11 January 1966 in Tashkent, Russia
 unki maut paak ke saath taashkand samjhaute ke baad ho gai
 The then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri went to Russia after India's victory over Pakistan in the 1965 war
 anil shastri kehete hai ki us vakt to main sirf 17 saal kaa tha lekin maa ne bataaya tha ki jab shastri ji kaa parthiv sharir dilli aayaa to us vakt unka cheharaa nila pad gaya tha or aankh ke paas safed dhabbe pad gaye the
 i also saw myself
 maa ne apane karibiyon se is baat ko kaha bhi ki shastri ji kii maut prakritik nahin lag rahi, baavjood us vakt naa to koi jaanch kamishan baithaaya gaya or naa hi rus main koi postmartm hua tha
 The comments itnaa hi nahin anil kehete hai ki hamaara andeh tab or bad gaya jab pataa chalaa ki shastri ji ko taashkand se 20 kilometre dur tehraaya gaya jahaan naa kamare main koi ghanti tha or naa hi koi telephone
 While the rest of the country's delegation was stationed in Tashkent
 itnaa hi nahi 2012 main ek artiai se khulaasa hua ki sarkaar isliye shastri ji se jude file ko isliye khulaasa nahin karnaa chaahati kyonki isse rashtriya suraksha ke saath-saath ek desh ke saath sambadh bighad jane kaa khatra tha
 Now that the government is celebrating the Golden Jubilee celebrations of the victory over Pakistan in 1965 for the first time, the family hopes that the Modi government may reveal the mystery behind Shastri's death

 Bhagwant Mann also termed the decision of Jarnail Singh to resign from Rajouri Garden and contest the Punjab election
 is kadam se punjab ke log siem phase ko lekar kanphyus ho gaye
 Mann also said that i opposed the nomination of some candidates, but instead of replacing them, the party itself isolated me

 If i had protested, i would have been held responsible for the party's defeat

 With this move, the people of Punjab got confused about CM Face

 In the ‘dalit writing ka dum’ session of ‘sahitya Aaj Tak’, three big writers associated with Dalit literature, Sharan Kumar Kumar Limale, Shioraj Singh Bechain and Rajiv Ranjan Prasad attended
 is satr kaa sanchaalan sanjay sinha ne kiya
 During the discussion, senior writer Sharan Kumar Limbale said that what is seen in society is also in literature
 agar samaaj main chuaachhut rahegaa to sahitya main bhi uskaa asar jarur dikhegaa
 He said that earlier our poems were not printed, we were asked to write the language, write it correctly
 uske baad hamen naam badalakar likhnaa padaa, tab jaakar hamen sweekaar kiya gaya

 sahitya ajtak 2018: dastak darbar ke manch par prasoon joshilimbale bole ki menstream ke sahitya main vichaar nahin he, hamaare sahitya main baba sahib ambedkar kaa vichaar he
 Our language sounds dirty to people, but we love that language
 unhone kaha ki jab ham dalit paatr kii baat karte hai, to uskaa puraa samaaj uske saath aata he
 Dalit literature always says that i hate mercy
 pragatisheel lekhakon ne likhaa isi kaaran dalit samaaj aaj kaa sahitya yahaan tak pahunchaa he
 'baba Saheb is the greatest writer of Dalits' magazine and writer Shyoraj Singh Bechain said that there are different castes in the society and hence there is also Dalit literature
 aajkal dalit shabd ko hataane kii baaten ho rahi hai, lekin dalit kii sthiti badalane par zyada dhyaan diya janaa chahie
 The diversity of society is seen in literature
 unhone kaha ki dalit sahitya ke sabase bade lekhak baba sahib ambedkar hi hai
 Literature is also a mirror of society, the issue of the person who is writing is also visible in literature
 unhone kaha ki premchand ne bhale hi daliton ke liye kahani likhi, lekin us kahani main unhen laalchee dikhaaya gaya he
 Bechain said that Indian society is like multi-layered society where no one is allowed to go from one floor to another
 jab tak jhaadu lagane vaala kavita likhakar kahani nahin bayaan karegaa, tab tak samaaj nahin samajhegaa
 Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, who came from Bastar in Chhattisgarh, said during the discussion that literature is a very big umbrella, Dalit literature has emerged like a movement in it
 isse koi varg vibhed nahin hota he, balki sahitya kaa har kshetra main vistaar hota he
 He said that the Dalit litterateur is using his writing more properly

 Jairam Ramesh asked the Prime Minister Road Development Fellow (PMRDF) to remove the 'garbage' taught by business institutions from his mind
 unhone kaha ki unke liye avasar he ki ve apane hunar or kshamta ko viksit kar vyavastha main kaam karnaa seekhen
 The Union Minister for Rural Development, while addressing the fellows from 83 districts of the country at the Academy of Administration in Bhopal, also advised them to stay in the system and fix it instead of cursing the system
 ejineering, kanoon or prabandhan sansthaanon se padhakar nikle ye phelo kendra sarkaar kii yojana ke tahat desh ke gramin evam naksal prabhavit kshetron main kaam kar rahe hai
 The minister said that though working in the system brings frustration, because you are familiar with the reality of the plan and the system, but take it as a challenge and fix it by staying in the system instead of cursing it
 ramesh ne kaha ki desh main gramin yojanaon ke kriyanvayan kii nigaraanee ke liye kaig or yojana ayog ke samaan anuvarthi lekha pareekshan centre banaaya jaayegaa
 He said that the CAG and the Planning Commission do an audit after the completion of the plan, but this center will evaluate the middle of the plan as well as suggest improvements
 unhone kaha ki june main is yojana kaa ek saal puraa ho jaayegaa 
 After this, in the second phase, a follow-up audit center will be opened under this scheme, which will monitor the rural development schemes

 His introduction to the novel states that he has written six 'blockbuster' novels
 ve sambhawatah bharat ke pehle lekhak hai jinhone bestceller ko blockbster bana diya
 He cannot be compared to any writer in India
 asal main ve lekhan kii duniya ke salmaan khan hai, har film relies hone se pehle hi saikadon karod kamaane ke liye badi hoti he, salmaan khan kii tarah unka muqabla kamai ke maamle main kisi or se nahin apane pichley upanyaas se hota he
 Salman Khan is not an actor, is Phenomina, Chetan Bhagat is also a writer, not Finomina, who gave a business model in writing to management, iit-educated youth, in which earning money, is glamor
 aise hi america kii fast company unako bijness ke kshetra main duniya ke 100 sabase rachanaatmak logon main thode ginati he
 Salman Khan made cinema a successful business model, Chetan Bhagat writing
 aap kahenge ki maine shuruyaat main kaha tha ki main chetan bhagat ke nae upanyaas ‘half garlfriend’ se kii thi, to itnaa or arj kar duun ki salmaan khan kii 100 karod- 200 karod bijness karne vaali filmon ko dekhne ke baad aap-mere jaise darshakon ko kya hasil hota he? chetan bhagat ko padhate hue bhi hasil hota he to bas yahi ki safalataa kaa ek or nayaa formula
 And to tell the truth, each time a new formula is given that just the readers keep searching for its formula
 neuyork times kaa kahana he ki chetan bhagat bharat ke ab tak ke sabase bikaoo lekhak hai
 So this novel will be further strengthened
 ‘half garlfriend’ kii kahani par aata hum
 From the film 'dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge', there was an increased emphasis on making sequences based on screenplays
 is upanyaas kii katha bhi sikvence main hai
 The writer meets Madhav Jha, the prince of the decaying princely state of Dumraon, at the Chanakya Hotel in Patna
 uske baad kahani dilli ke saint steffens college main pravesh kar jaati he jahaan madhav jha basketbaal ke cote par daakhila paata he, jahaan riya somani uske jivan main aa jaati he, phir chali jaati he
 The second sequence of the story follows Madhav Jha in Dumraon where his mother returns to work at the ramshackle school of Rani Sahiba, kicking off the HSBC job of 50,000
 uske skool kii haalat sudhaarney ke liye bill gates kaa daura hone vaala hota uske liye madhav angreji main bhaashan dene ke liye patna main angreji seekhney ke ek koching main daakhila letaa he
 (kamaal Banda could not learn English even after studying in Stephens, while my friends doing science honors from there also started to gitpit in English), and Miracle happens Riya comes to Patna after getting rid of her marriage in a year and a half
 Teaches and disappears on the day Bill Gates gets the donation of his English speech
 upanyaas kii kahani kaa teesraa sikvence he neuyork kaa
 From Dumraon, Madhav Jha goes there in search of Riya
 jane se pehle riya ek chitthee jo chhod gai thi or pehali baar usko ai lav you bhi likh gai thi
 The hero had to go to New York in search of his first and true love
 bas itnaa sa hint tha madhav ko ki riya kaa sapana tha ki vah apane mata-pita, pati sabaki akut daulat ko chhodkar neuyork main restaraan main singer banegi
 The bus takes three months and finds true love
 yahi he ek blockbster upanyaas likhane vaale lekhak ke nae blockbster upanyaas kii kahani, jiske ek pakke blockbster film banane kaa chance he
 Here i am writing on 'half Girlfriend', there is news coming on TV that a film is being announced and it is being talked about with Ranbir Kapoor or Ranveer Singh for the role of Madhav Jha
 half garlfriend ko phul wif banane main aajkal bade papad belane padate hai
 But there is one thing Bande has done research well
 litti chokha khaane ke liye vah maurya lok jaataa he, jahaan sach main bahut acha litti chokha miltaa he
 But Bhagat Babu made a mistake by making Jhaji the king of Dumraon
 lekin fiction main to sab chalata he na
 The reading of a 260-page novel is that you should read the novel only in one and a half hour flight from Delhi to Patna
 keemat bhi kam ho or drama, melodrama kambine ho, agxottic lokation ho, sushi se lekar litti chokha tak sab ho, or haa apane patna vaala chanakya hotel ho, gaanv-dehaat se lekar neuyork ke life kii rangini ho
 Now what do you want in a novel worth Rs 149
 itnaa sab kuch ek upanyaas main dene vaale chetan bhagat baba kii jai ho
 Whether it is given or not, Bhagat Baba has given a new phrase to the new generation like a popular dialogue of the film- Half Girlfriend! (prabhat Ranjan has written this review on his literary blog 'jankipul'

 pakistani cinema ke log bhi id ke maukey kaa phayda uthaanaa chaahate hai or isi maukey par vahaan do filmein relies ho rahi hai
 In such a situation, given the fanfollowing of Salman, the filmmakers are afraid that if Salman's 'tubelight' burns, then his film's light will not go away

 According to media reports, Hirachand Dand, president of the Indian Film Exporters Association, said, 'pakistan's local distributors are not wanting to release Salman's film there because two big films are being released in Pakistan on Eid day itself
 aise main mekars salmaan kii film vahaan relies karke koi risk uthaanaa nahin chaahate
 Pakistani film distributors, producers and directors want Pakistani cinema to benefit from this opportunity

 Now it has been decided that elections will be held in Delhi
 chunavi sargharmiyaan bhi bad gai hai lekin chunaav kab honge isko lekar suspence he
 Although political parties are demanding elections in the Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly as well as Delhi, but experts say that this will not be possible
 raashtrapati or cabinet kii ore se uparajyapal kidilli vidhansabha bhangkarne kii sifarish ko manjuuri milane ke baad siyaasi partiyon ne taal thonknaa shuru kar diya he
 There is a BJP government at the center but the party has kept silence about the time of elections
 aise main sawaal ye he ki kya jharkhand or jammu-kashmir ke saath hi dilli main vidhansabha chunaav karaae ja sakate hai
 It is not possible if the experts agree
 samvidhan visheshgy subhash kashyap ne kaha ki chunaav ayog ko kam se kam 34 dinon kaa vakt chahie hota he
 Apart from this, usually elections are not held in January as there is a job of adding new voters to the voter list
 saath hi uttar bharat main thand bhi kaaphi padati he
 According to experts, elections in Delhi may be held in February
 jaankaar bataate hai ki ye koi jaruri nahin ki vidhansabha bhang karne ke turant baad hi chunaav karaae jaaen
 As soon as the notification of dissolution of the assembly is issued
 dilli kaa chunaav ayog kendriya chunaav ayog ko jaankaree degaa or phir chunaav kii taarikh tay hogi
 But if the elections are held after January 1, then the Election Commission will have to face many big challenges
 sabase badi chunauti hogi un saare votaron ke naam jodna jo 2014 main 18 saal ke ho jaaenge

 In this, provisions have also been made regarding the transfer of judges and appointment of Chief Justices and other judges of High Courts
 prastaav ke anusaar, bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish engeesi ke pramukh honge
 Apart from the Chief Justice, the judiciary will be represented by two senior judges of the Supreme Court
 do jaani maani hastiyaan or vidhi mantri prastaavit ikai ke anya sadsy honge
 To overcome the apprehensions of the judiciary, the composition of the Commission has been accorded constitutional status to ensure that no government in the future can weaken its structure by a simple bill
 samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak ko jahaan do tihaai bahumat kii jarurat hoti he vahiin saadhaaran vidheyak ke liye saamaanya bahumat jaruri hota he
 In place of the present system of appointment of judges, Justice Lodha's comments regarding the government's proposal to set up a National Judicial Commission for appointment of judges in the highest judiciary are very important

 The Chief Justice said that the first batch of judges to be appointed through the Jury of Judges in the country is the result of that and Justice Rohinton Nariman, who sits with him, is the latest to receive promotion to the top court through the Jury
 nyaayamurti lodha ne kaha, ‘yadi aap kehete hai ki nirnaayak mandal vifal ho gaya he to unki dein bhi vifal ho gai he
 If you say so, we have also failed and the judiciary has also failed completely
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘is maamle main ab thodaa bahut hi kar sakate hai
 The Chief Justice said, "all the judges of this time are the product of this jury system
" santhaan ke rup main vyaktiyon kaa chayan karne main nirnaayak mandal kii apni simaaen hai
 After all, judges also come from this society
 lekin ek yaa do nyaayadhishon ke khilaaf aarope hone ke kaaran abhiyaan chalaanaa anuchit he
 'the court said,' The jury never recommended the name of Justice Manjunath
 ’ nyaayalay ne kaha ki yah janhit yachika asangat aadhaar par he
 The judges said, 'do not petition for God for such facts which do not exist
 baar baar aise mudde ke bare main prayaas kiye ja rahe hai jo tathyaatmak rup se galat he
 "the judges said," If there is a campaign to discredit the judiciary in the eyes of the public, then you are doing great harm to democracy
 nyaaypalika ke prati janata kaa vishwaas na toden
 The Chief Justice said that wrong facts are being presented in the media
 unhone kaha ki nyaayadhish kaa tabadalaa ek baat he, jabaki padonnati alag baat he
 We have not made any such recommendation
 is maamle kii sunwaayee shuru hote hi nyaayalay ne yachikakarta se jaananaa chaha ki nirnaayak mandal dwaara nyaayadhish ke naam kii sifarish ke bare main kahaan se jaankaree mili
 When the court said that Justice Manjunath's name had not been recommended, the counsel for the petitioner cited media reports and said that if the facts in the media are false then action should be taken in the matter
 lekin nyaayalay ne kaha ki aap chaahate hai ki media report ke aadhaar par ham nyaayik kaam karen
 The petition requested that all the recommendations of the jury regarding appointment of judges in future should be put on the website of the apex court

 com / nmosrmmqhitippaniyam One of the biggest enemies of India, the murder of hundreds of innocents, the stars of Hafiz Saeed, a US $ 10 million terrorist from the United Nations, suddenly fell into disarray
 pakistan main use ekaek nazarband kar liya gaya, lekin jo pakistan ab tak haafiz said ke khilaaf anginat subooton kii andekhi karata rahaa, akhirkaar ab usne haafiz said ko achaanak nazarband kyon kar liya? yahi lakh take kaa sawaal bhi he
 Everything was going well till now in Hafiz Saeed's life
 wo kabhi begunaahon kaa koon baha kar chup-chaap bill main ja ghusata
 Sometimes in the name of Jihad, he tried to provoke the separatists of Kashmir
 kabhi hindustan or america ko apana dushman bataa kar khud kaa kad ooncha karata
 Sometimes he would openly respect his own rulers
 lekin ab tarikh badal chuki he
 The Nizam has changed
 isi ke saath haafiz kii taqadir badal chuki he
 Probably only then, which Hafiz Saeed was on a holiday in Pakistan with a reward of ten million US dollars on his head till yesterday
 use raaton-raat apane hi baade main nazarband hona pad gaya
 First, the government issued a decree to clamp down on the tag of Most Argentine and then the next day the police of Pakistan went to his hideout in Lahore to arrest him
 lekin jate-jate bhi haafiz said ek baar phir zehar ugal kar gaya
 There will be very few people in the world, who would really feel this action, effective action against Hafiz Saeed
 balki jaankaron kii maane to use nazarband karne kii ye kavayad sivaay pakistani drame ke or kuch bhi nahin
 Otherwise, against Hafiz Saeed, India alone has given so much evidence to Pakistan that even once Pakistan had taken them seriously, the rest of Hafiz's age would have been left behind bars
 akhir pakistan ke saath achaanak aisi koun si majaburi aa gai ki jiske khilaaf maujuud anginat subooton kii wo ab tak andekhi karata rahaa tha, achaanak usee haafiz said par use haath daalana pad gaya
 The answer is a campaign launched against the terror of the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi and revenge in America across the seven seas
 america ke nae raashtrapati donald trump pehle hi din se aatankwaad ke khilaaf sakhti se pesh aane kii baat kehete rahe hai
 Not only they have been saying that as soon as they come to power, they have banned the entry of citizens of seven countries
 duusari ore aatankwaad ke masale par modi or trump ek-duusare ke saath khadey nazar aate hai
 In such a situation, pressure on Pakistan is inevitable
 jaankaron kii maane to yahi wo vajah he, jisase ghabara kar ab pakistan use nazarband karne kii baat karne laga he, jo kal tak uski ankhon kaa tara hua karata tha
 In such a situation, the real meaning of this action will be revealed tomorrow
 bihar main bijepi ke ummidavaaron kii pehali list jari hote hi ghamaasan much gaya he

 bihari babu ke kareebi sutron ke mutabik shatrughna sinha ne saaf kar diya he ki patna sahib hi unki pehali or aakhri pasand he or is mudde par kisi charchaa kii koi gunjaaish nahin he
 It is worth noting that while releasing the list, party general secretary Anant Kumar said that after talking to Shatrughan Sinha, the seat of Patna Sahib will be decided, although Bihari Babu is ready to wait but will not leave Patna Sahib's seat in any condition, it should be clear has gone
 udhar bijepi ke firebrand leader or modi ke khasmkhas maane jane vaale giriraaj singh ne navada seat par ummidavaari ke elaan ke baad vahaan se chunaav nahin ladane ke sanket die hai
 According to sources close to Giriraj Singh, he is very angry at being given a ticket from Nawada
 giriraaj singh ne khud ke liye begusarai kii seat maangi thi par party ne begusarai se navada ke saansad bholaa singh ko tikat diya he
 On the other hand, Narendra Modi's other close and national secretary Rameshwar Chaurasia is also angry
 chaurasia karakaat seat par apni daavedaari jataa rahe the par sutron ke mutabik ye seat gathbandhan main upendra kushvaha kii party ko diya janaa tay he aise main chaurasia ne bhi alaakaman ko apni naaraazgi se avgat kara diya he
 The way the candidature of 11 mps has been retained from the current 12 mps, but suspense remains on the seat of Bihari Babu, it is clear that the discord in Bihar BJP can come out clearly
 apane bagawati andaaj ke liye mashhoor shatrughna sinha ne haalanki khulkar apni baat nahin kahi he par uttar pradesh kii tarah ab bihar main bhi bijepi ko party ke bheetar hi kalah se rou-ba-rou hona pad saktaa he

 See Video - aisa koun hoga jisane train ke safar main chaay kii chuskiyon kaa anand nahin liya hoga
 You will also remember waking up in the morning warmed up with the sound of hot tea, hot tea and drinking a cup of tea from the train window
 chaay acchhee or bharose kii ho isliye aap is baat kaa khaas khyaal rakhte hai ki vardi vaale vendor se hi chaay khariden
 Many times it is also written to warn the passengers at the railway station that only buy tea or food items from the authorized vendors of the railway because it can be dangerous to buy food for unknown people outside
 ham aapako dikhaaenge wo video jise dekhne ke baad aap train main chaay kharidne se pehle sau baar sochenge
 How will you feel when the water is taken from the toilet by train for the tea you are drinking
 or ye karatuut vardi pahanane vaale log kar rahe hai- yatriyon kii najaron ke saamne
 If you are not sure, see yourself
 is video main neeli shart kii jeb main chaay kaa cap liye ye aadmi train ke toilet ke paas mandara rahaa he
 The train is stopped at a station and it looks a bit nervous
 uski harkaton se saaf he ki wo kisi baat kaa intjaar kar rahaa he
 He looks at the door of the train and looks around, looking at whether someone is coming
 puure pachaas second tak wo aise hi toilet ke baahar intjaar karata hua dikhataa he
 Then the toilet door opens and then it becomes clear what he is doing near the toilet of the train
 toilet kaa darwaja khulata he or bheetar se uskaa doosraa saathi dikhataa he
 He catches this man from inside a container selling steel tea
 is container ko votrain ke get pararakh detaa he or jaldi se aisa hi doosraa container us aadmi se letaa he jo toilet ke bheetar he
 Third, the man inside the toilet was coming out with a similar container when he saw a passenger coming from the front and instead of going out he went to the other side
 lekin jaise hi wo phir se saamne aata he un logon ko ehsaas hota he ki mobile main unki harakatein kaid kii ja rahi hai
 The person making his video asks him in Telugu why he is taking tea water from the restroom
 donon kuch jawaab nahin dete hai
 And some get nervous and go towards the other compartment in the train instead of going out
 tabhi plateform par in logon kaa teesraa saathi is baat ko dekh letaa he ki unki chori pakadi ja chuki he
 He comes and goes with the container placed at the train gate
 jaise hi ye video soshal media par aayaa teji se viral hone laga
 Whoever saw this, his blood boiled with anger
 logon ko laga ki railway bhala apane yatriyon ke saath aisa kaise hone de saktaa he
 The matter becomes even more serious because those who were shamelessly engaged in drinking tea with toilet water, were seen in uniform
 nile rang kii shart par vendor kii company kaa logo dekha ja saktaa he
 To get a viral test of this news and to get to the bottom of it, we contacted some people who were among the first to put it on social media
 is video ko pehle twit karne waalon main aar
 There was also Kasturirangan (@rkayr)
 lekin unhone bataaya ki ye video unhen watsap group se jariye mila he
 After talking to several officials of Railways and IRCTC, it was found that this incident is absolutely true
 hamaari lagaataar poochtacha ke baad railway ne is ghatana ko sweekaar karte hue ek spashtikaran bhi jari kiya
 According to the railway, this incident is from Secunderabad station in Telangana
 teenon log jis train ke toilet se bhare gaye container ko idhar se udhar kar rahe hai wo charminar express he jiskaa number he 12759 he
 The railway claims that the incident occurred four months ago in December 2017
 haalanki ye khabar soshal media par pichley kuch dinon main hi viral hui he
 According to railway officer Vedprakash, the people appearing in blue shirts are people from the catering company at Charminar station who were working there illegally
 lekin railway ne mana ki plateform par khadaa teesraa vyakti pien jayachandra he railway ke katerr pi
 Works for Shivprasad
 hamane shivaprasad se bhi baat kii lekin usne jawaab dene ke bajaay sirf ye kahkar phone rakh diya ki uske logon kii vardi kaa rang kuch or he
 But the railway says that during interrogation, this Jayachandra told that those people were not filling water inside the toilet but were pouring milk from one vessel to another
 lekin railway ne toilet main khaane pine kii chijen le jane ke liye pi
 Shivaprasad's company was also fined one lakh
