 com / gyjpmdg8eavideo- rajyasabha main pesh hoga teen talaak bill, sarkaar ke liye aasaan nahin raah For the last few years, the Parliament is becoming a platform of protest
 jab koi mudda garam hota he yaa koi vivaad hota he to gaaj sansad par hi girti he
 The opposition puts full force not to run as if the running of Parliament will break the sky and ruin the country
 vipaksh khaskar bijepi ne 2ji ghotaalaa, koyala ghotaalaa jaise bade muddon par to vyavdhaan paidaa kiya hi, chote-chote muddon par bhi koharaam machaaya or sansad nahin chalane di
 Now Parliament is unable to run on the Telangana issue
 congress chaahati he ki vah telugana ke vibhaajan kaa bill rakhe lekin uskaa itnaa virodh he ki sadan kii baithak radd kerani pad rahi he
 There are only a few days left in the life of the 15th Lok Sabha and its performance has been the worst in the Lok Sabha elected so far
 isane sabase kam bill paarit kiye or mahatvapurn muddon par isamen sabase kam bahes hui he
 This season lists 39 bills, most of which have no future
 yani ve paarit nahin ho sakenge
 If any bill can be passed in this session, it is Vote on Account
 matlab saaf he ki yah satr bhi kolahal or shorsharabe kii bhent chadhane ja rahaa he
 If the Congress resolves the issue of Telangana by sitting with the BJP, then the time will be so short that nothing creative will be done
 agar kuch bill paarit kara bhi die jate hai to unamem bahes kii gunjaaish nahin rahegi jaisaa pichley kuch satron main hua tha
 It would also be a shame that bills of national importance are being passed without any debate
 ek samay tha jab sansad main bilon par jabardast bahes chhidati thi, sadasyon kii vidwata, unki vakpatutaa ke charche hote the or janata main ek acha sandesh jaataa tha
 It is a beautiful aspect of parliamentary democracy
 lekin ab kuch varshon se sansad koharaam or shorsharabe ke liye jaani ja rahi he
 There seems to be no place left for brainstorming and creative conversation
 isi sansad main anek vishyon par ghanton bahes chalaa karti thi, sadsy hafton pehle se taiyaari karte the or apni baat asardaar dhang se rakhte the
 But now the matter does not move beyond the noise
 lagata he ki sadasyon kii bhi ruchi isamen khatm ho gai he
 They walkout and do not allow any discussion in the House
 yah baat alag he ki baad main kai sadsy usee vishay par tivi channelon par garmagarm charchaa karte dikh jate hai
 This is a danger bell for Indian democracy
 samvidhan ke nirmaataaon ne yah kabhi nahin sochaa hoga ki is mahatvapurn sadan kaa yah hashr hoga
 Now the time has come to think about how to stop wasting its precious time
 isse pehle ki loktantr kaa yah stambh gir jaae koi thos kadam uthaanaa hi hoga

 The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has had a heat action plan for the last three years, that is, an action plan for how people can be protected from heat during summer
 puure desh main ahmedabad iklauta aisa shahar he jiske paas aisa acshan plan he
 In this plan, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has entered into an agreement with the Indian Institute of Public Health and Georgia Tech University of America under which the Georgia Tech University daily predicts the temperature of Ahmedabad for the next 7 days and accordingly the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation would make its preparations in the city is
 is plan ke tahat teen tarah ke alert jari kiye jate hai
 The first is yellow alert - when the city temperature is between 40 and 43 degrees, Orange alert - when the city temperature is between 43 and 45 degrees, red alert - when the temperature is increasing by 45 degrees
 jab orenj or red alert ho tab shahar main jagah-jagah pani kaa intjaam karnaa, logon ke liye garmiyon main jagah-jagah hording lagaana jisamen garmi se kaise nipta jaay isaki jaankaree ho, masalan zyada pani pinaa, chacha pinaa, dopaher ko baahar na nikalnaa, baahar nikalen to har thodi der par chhaanv main khadey rahanaa vagairah
 Apart from this, special information is also given to the hospitals that how to take care of them if they are sick due to heat stroke
 jagah-jagah pani ke saath-saath oares ke ghol uplabdh karwaanaa
 Due to this plan, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has also received an award
 tippaniyan But when it was investigated in the city, all this preparation was found only on paper
 shahar ke teen darwaja jaise bade bazaaron main gayi to pine ke pani kaa koi injam nahin tha, intjaam tha to dukandaaron ne apane taur par kiya tha taaki unke graahakon ko garmi se pareshaani na ho
 Most of the hoardings were found empty even in such heat, on which there was no hoarding giving any information
 logon main bhi isaki jaankaree kaa puraa abhaav dikhaa
 It seems that hundreds of people are dying due to heat wave across the country, due to lack of concrete implementation despite plans to deal with it, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation is not able to become a role model in the country which is desperately needed
 is plan main ahmedabad mahanagarapalika ne indian institute of public health or america kii georgia tech university ke saath ek samjhauta kiya he jiske tahat georgia tech university roj ahmedabad kaa agle 7 dinon kaa taapmaana kii sambhaavna bataati he or uske mutabik ahmedabad mahanagarapalika shahar main apni taiyaari karata he

 When there is orange and red alert, then water can be arranged in the city, place hoardings for people in the summer, which knows how to deal with the heat, like drinking more water, buttermilk, not getting out in the afternoon , Exit and then stand in the shade every once in a while
 iske alaava aspataalon ko bhi khaas soochna di jaati he ki hit stroke yani lu lagane kii vajah se koi bimaar hokar aaye to uski kis tarah se dekhbhaal kii jaay
 Providing ORS solutions along with water at various places
 isi plan kii vajah se ahmedabad mahanagarapalika ko ek award bhi mila he
 The comments lekin jab shahar main isaki padtaal kii gai to ye puri taiyaari sirf kaagazon main hi pai gai
 If we went to big markets like the three gates of the city, there was no arrangement for drinking water, there was a provision, then the shopkeepers did it on their own so that their customers would not have trouble with the heat
 zyaadaatar hording itani garmi main bhi khaali mili jin par koi jaankaree denevaale hording nahin the
 People also showed complete lack of information about it
 isse lagata he ki puure desh main hit wave kii vajah se saikadon log mar rahe hai tab isse nipatane kii yojana hone ke baavjood thos amal na hone kii vajah se ahmedabad mahanagarapalika desh main ek role model nahin ban paa rahi he jisaki sakht jarurat he

 bijepi saansad yogi adityanath kii adhyakshata vaali samiti ne doorgaami siforishein karte hue saansadon ke maujuuda vetan 50,000 rupee, ko badhaakar doguna karne ko kaha he or purv saansadon kii pension 20,000 rupee se badhaakar 35,000 rupee karne kii vakaalat kii he
 The committee has also recommended that the daily allowance for mps to be present in the House during Parliament sessions should be increased from Rs 2,000 to Rs 4,000
 aisa samajha jaataa he ki samiti ke saamne pesh hue kuch purv saansadon ne rosh vyakt karte hue kaha ki unhen train main yatra ke liye pratham shrenee kaa tikat to diya jaataa he, lekin unke saath chalane vaale, bhale hi unke pati yaa patni hi kyon na ho, ko dwitiya shrenee kaa hi tikat diya jaataa he
 The committee is also believed to have recommended that the former MP and his 'companion' be given a first class ticket
 iske alaava, samiti kaa maananaa he ki purv saansadon ko saal main paanch baar iconmi class main hawaii yatra karne kii anumati di jaani chahie
 mps are allowed to travel in executive class about 36 times a year
 samiti ne yah bhi kaha ki chunki saansadon ko cabinet sachiv kii rank se upar mana jaataa he, isliye unki suvidhaayen bhi usee darje se mail khaani chahie
 The committee also recommended providing health care facilities to married children of mps

 The salary and allowances of mps were last reviewed in 2010
 maujuuda samiti kii ore se ek baar siforishein saunp die jane ke baad aglaa punarikshan paanch saal baad kiya jayega
 However, CPI-M member KN Balagopal suggested that mps should not fix their own salary and allowances and an independent system should be put in place for this
 samiti main jadyu ke pratinidhi evam rajyasabha sadsy kasee tyaagi ne bhi kaha ki vetan-bhatton ke punarikshan ke liye gathit kiye jane vaale vibhinn bordon or aayogon ke maddenjar saansadon ke vetan-bhatte tay karne ke liye ek swatantra nikaay gathit kiya janaa chahie
 Some members of the committee said that since India is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations group, the salary and allowances of its mps should be at par with other member countries of the group
 tippaniyan The reason for the use of the word 'partner' in place of 'spouse' was stated that many mps are either unmarried or for some other reason not their husband or wife
 niyamon ke mutabik, saansadon ko trainon main pratham shrenee main yatra karne kii anumati hoti he or ve vaataanukoolit dwitiya shrenee ke ek tikat kii keemat ke baraabar yatra bhatta, mahangaai bhatta praapt karte hai

 desh ke pramukh hawaonddon ke naam jaani-maani hastiyon ke naam par rakhe jate rahe hai

 The names of the 6 airports that were changed, named after these 5 personalities, explained the reason behind this that passengers and foreign tourists have to face inconvenience regarding the names of the airport, because they are not aware of the Indian personalities at which the airports are be named after
 kendriya naagarik uddyan rajya mantri jayant sinha ne kaha, 'ye maamla jaanch ke tahat he
 We are looking at how to deal with this issue well '
 shaharon par hi hawaonddon ke naam rakhe jane vaale prastaav kii jo bhashaa thi wo taarkik or pragatisheel thi
 On May 3, 2016, the government told the Rajya Sabha, 'travelers and especially foreign tourists do not know much about the local history of the area, so in view of the inconvenience caused to them, it has come to such a view that the airports should be named after the same city
 , Where they are located or operating
 hawaonddon ke terminlon ke naam jane maane logon par rakhe ja sakate hai‚Äô
 But following this idealistic proposal, could the government formulate policy? How many airports were changed in the last 10 years? How many proposals are currently under consideration with the current government to change the names of the airports? What is the procedure for changing the names of airports? With these questions, India Today sought information from the Ministry of Civil Aviation under rtiact
 hamen jo jaankaree mili wo ye he-hawalddeka naam badalane ke liye rajya vidhansabha main pehle prastaav paas hona chahie
 It then goes to the Union Cabinet and is finally notified in the Gazette of India

 Of these, 5 are named after the personalities

 Modi said that Congress is the root of all the problems of the country
 deshvasi jab tak congress kaa charitra nahin samajhenge, tab tak desh kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan nahin hoga
 The cause of the country's problems is nothing but Congress governments
 desh ko samasyaon se mukt karne ke liye desh ko congress se mukt karnaa hoga
 In the economic capital of the country, he said, 'the specialty of the Congress policy is to divide and state, he is an expert in this policy
 usne pani ke liye desh main ladaai karwaai
 Congress is immersed in vote bank politics
 ' angrejon ke khilaaf ladate-ladate congress ne unase kaaphi kuch sikh hasil kii

 unhone kaha ki gujarat mumbai kaa doosraa bhai he
 The country has to overcome the politics of vote bank
 modi ne kaha ki congress ne sampradayikta kii niti bhi vot bank ke liye apanaai
 Freeing the country from vote bank politics will not lead to the politics of development till then the problems of the country will not be solved

 The Congress on Friday retaliated after BJP President Amit Shah called former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru as the 'father' of the Kashmir problem, claiming that the leaders of the ruling party are blamed if they suffer from strangulation
 
 party ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki kashmir kii maujuuda halaat ke liye bhaajapa jimmedaar he jisane pidipi ke saath avasarwaadi gathbandhan kiya tha
 Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari told reporters, Pandit Nehru ji becomes responsible if the throat of the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders gets sore or there is a sore throat
 manish tiwari ne daawa kiya ki agar kashmir kii paristhiti kharaab hui he to uske liye bijepi puri tarah se jimmedaar he
 The opportunistic alliance he had formed with the PDP has brought Jammu and Kashmir to the fold
 tiwari ne kaha, jab 2015 main chunaav hue the tab 64 pratishat logon ne vot daale the
 When the Lok Sabha by-election was held in Srinagar, seven percent of the people cast their votes
 tiwari ne kaha ki ye jo bade turram khan banate hai, jo sarkaar main baithe hai, wo anantnag kii loksabhaa seat kaa upachunaav aaj tak nahin karvaa paae hai
 In such a situation, if the situation in Jammu and Kashmir worsens, then opportunistic alliance with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his government and PDP is directly responsible for it
 darasal, amit shah ne pulavama aatanki hamale kii prishthbhumi main brihaspativaar ko ek jansabha main daawa kiya tha ki pakistan jis kashmir ke kaaran aatankwaadi ghatnaayen karvaa rahaa he us samasya ke janak jawahar laal nehru hai

 Digvijay Singh tweeted that Navjot Sidhu should explain to his friend Imran Bhai, because of that you are being abused
 bataa den ki pulavama aatanki hamale ke peeche pakistan ke aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad shaamil tha
 It was Jaish who trained terrorist Adil Dar
 is aatanki hamale main siarpief ke 40 jawan shahid ho gaye
 Pakistan has not taken any action on Jaish after this terrorist attack

 Terrorists do not have many religion and religion
 duniya main achche, bure log hai
 Every institution has such people
 har desh main aise log hote hai
 Those who are evil should be punished, but it is not fair to blame everyone for the cowardly act of a bad person
 siddhu ke is bayaan ke baad desh ke logon kaa gussa bhadak gaya tha
 While BJP leaders questioned Sidhu, Congress General Secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad said on Sidhu's statement that it is not the time to negotiate with Pakistan
 pakistan ke saath kisi bhi tarah kii baatcheet karnaa bevakoofi hogi
 The martyrdom of our soldiers will have to be given a strong answer for this

 input language maharashtra kii siyaasi bisaat par haari baaji ko jitkar sikandar banakar ubhare kaddavar netaa sharad pavaar ne ek baar phir sabit kar diya ki buddhi ke mukaable anubhav ko kam karke nahin aanka ja saktaa
 In history, he will be remembered not only for keeping his fort safe but also for denting the 30 years old friendship between BJP and Shiv Sena
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ek baar pavaar kii saraahna karte hue kaha tha ki vah raajnneeti ke gur seekhney ke liye ensipi netaa se salaah lete the
 It is now clear to the political pundits as to why Modi is an admirer of Pawar's political skills
 bijepi dwaara shivasena ko mukhyamantri pad nahin dene ke baad congress kaa sheersh netritv bala sahab thakare kii viraasat sambhaal rahi party ke saath jane ko ekbargi taiyaar nahin tha
 But Pawar, like a cautious politician, persuaded the Congress leadership for this and agreed to join hands with the Shiv Sena
 haalanki bhattije ajit pavaar ke raaton raat paala badalakar devendra fadanvis kii sarkaar main upmukhyamantri pad kii shapath lene se ek baar laga tha ki maharashtra kii raajnneeti kaa sher sharad pavaar ab chook chukaa he
 But in the very next stakes, Pawar stunned not only the BJP but all political analysts
 maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav se pehle bijepi ne apane prachaar bal ke jariye yah sabit karne kaa prayaas kiya tha ki vah rajya main prachand bahumat se vaapasi kar rahi he
 Even BJP President Amit Shah announced Fadnavis as the next Chief Minister of the state during the election campaign
 kintu prachaar kii is chakachaundh se prabhavit hue bina 78 varshiya pavaar ne gaanv gaanv or lagbhag har nirvachan kshetra main jaakar apana prachaar abhiyaan jari rakhaa
 During the assembly elections, a photo of Pawar was made in the national headline in an election rally of Satara in which he continued his speech in the rainy water
 usee jansabha main pavaar ne kaha tha ki yah barish ‚Äò‚Äòishwar kii krupa '' he
 This time from the Satara Assembly seat, Srinivas Patil of NCP defeated Udayan Raje Bhonsle, a BJP candidate and descendant of Shivaji Maharaj
 vidhansabha chunaav main congress-ensipi gathbandhan kaa cheharaa hi pavaar the
 The BJP knew this very well and that's why Pawar was the target of the attacks of most of the leaders including Modi, Shah during the election campaign
 kintu pavaar ne apane kushal prachaar abhiyaan or apane party ke sahi ummidavaar chunakar rajya kii 54 siton par ensipi ko safalataa dilwaai
 Pawar also has deep penetration in the sugar cooperatives, which play an important role in the politics of Maharashtra
 vah mahaj 27 varsh kii umr main baraamati se vidhayak bane or keval das saal baad 38 varsh kii umr main maharashtra ke sabase yuva mukhyamantri ban gayi the
 He has become the Chief Minister of Maharashtra a total of three times
 pavaar ke pehali baar mukhyamantri banane kaa ghatnakram kisi rochak katha se kam nahin hai
 The Congress lost several seats in Maharashtra in the post-emergency elections
 iske baad rajya ke mukhyamantri shankar raav chavaan ne haar kii naitik jimmedaari lete hue apane pad se istipha de diya
 Vasantdada Patil succeeded him as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra
 baad main congress main tut ho gai or party congress (you) tathaa congress (ai) main bant gai
 Pawar's Guru Yashwant Rao and Pawar joined the Congress (U)
 1978 main maharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav hua or congress ke donon dhadon ne alag-alag chunaav ladaa
 Later, to keep the Janata Party out of power, the two factions of the Congress formed a government together
 vasantdada patil mukhyamantri bane rahe
 Sharad Pawar became the Minister of Industry and Labor in this government
 bataaya jaataa he ki july 1978 main sharad pavaar ne apane guru ke ishaare par congress (you) se khud ko alag kar liya or janata party ke saath milakar gathbandhan sarkaar banaai
 Later Yashwant Rao Patil also joined Sharad Pawar's party

 sonia gandhi ke videshi mul kaa hone ke kaaran unhen congress adhyaksh banaaye jane kaa virodh karne par unhen congress se alag hokar rashtravaadi congress party kaa gathan karnaa padaa
 But due to deep penetration in Pawar's politics, the Congress had to form a government in Maharashtra for three consecutive times in alliance with his party
 atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar ke hatane ke baad jab 2004 main upie kii sarkaar bani to pavaar ko krishi mantri banaaya gaya
 However, before that he had taken charge of the Ministry of Defense in the 1990s
 baad main 2009 main bhi vah kendra main krishi mantri bane
 Pawar announced in 2012 that he would no longer contest the Lok Sabha elections
 kintu chunaav ladane kaa arth sakriy raajnneeti se sanyas lenaa nahin hota he
 Pawar showed in Maharashtra events that he still has the same grip on state politics as he used to be four decades ago
 britain se kohinoor hira waapas laane ke mudde par shuukravaar ko videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj or samskruti mantri mahesh sharma ke bich ek baithak main charchaa hui
 a source said that the meeting lasted for more than 45 minutes and issues related to the 108-carat diamond were discussed
 yah hira philhal tower of landan main pradarshit rajmukut main laga he
 In April, the government stated in the Supreme Court that the British neither forcibly took away the diamond, nor did it steal it, but it was given as a gift to the East India Company by the rulers of Punjab
 is heere ko laane main kai kanoonee or takneekee adchane hai kyonki yah aazaadee purv kaal kaa he or is tarah yah puraavashesh evam kala sampada adhinium, 1972 ke daayre main nahin aata
 However, after hearing the rebuke, the government said that all efforts will be made to bring back this diamond
 isaki keemat 2000 lakh dollars hone kaa anumaan he
 The comments may main sharma ne sansad ko bataaya tha ki videsh mantralay britain kii sarkaar ke saath is mudde kaa santoshjanak hal paane ke taur tareekon par gaur kar rahaa he
 However, this diamond is a subject of historical ownership dispute and at least four countries including India have claimed it
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) april main sarkaar ne ucchtam nyaayalay main kaha tha ki hira ko british na to jabardasti le gaye or na hi unhone use churaayaa, balki ise punjab ke shaskaon dwaara east india company ko uphaar ke rup main diya gaya
 There are many legal and technical hurdles in bringing this diamond as it is of pre-independence period and thus it does not come under the purview of the Antiquities and Art Estates Act, 1972
 haalanki fatkaar sunne ke baad sarkaar ne kaha tha ki is heere ko waapas laane kii sabhi koshish kii jaaegi
 It is estimated to cost $ 2 million

 The charge, of the murder of his own half-brother
 wo bhi videshi jameen par or behad rahasyamayi tareeke se
 Inside the busy airport of Malaysia, the dictator's stepbrother was attacked by two girls with poisonous sprays and needles, only in films and stories
 malaysia kii rajdhani kwalalampur kaa international airport
 a man of mediocre age with all the people waiting for his flight at the airport waiting lounge
 isi bich achaanak do mahilaayein nazar aati he
 In the blink of an eye these women attack on one person and the next moment both disappear in the crowd
 sisitivi kii tasviren jitani rahasyamayi hai, iske peeche kii kahani utani hi pechida
 Can anyone kill hundreds of people by spraying poison spray on someone's face or by needling it? And that too quickly and easily? Whatever your answer to these questions, but the fact is that within a few minutes of this attack, this person lost his life
 iske saath duniya bhar main haal ke dinon ke is sabase charchit siyaasi qatl ko lekar ek badi bahes kii shuruyaat ho gai
 Tension has arisen between many countries
 jaanate hai kyon? kyonki, ye qatl kisi maamuli insaan kaa nahin, balki uttar korea ke siraphire taanashaah kim jong un ke sautele bhai kim jong naam kaa hua tha
 Yes, Kim Jong Un, the cynical and cynical dictator of North Korea, who has so far killed many of his unnamed relatives and is threatening to ruin some
 uske is sautele bhai kim jong naam kaa jis tareeqe se qatl hua he, wo apane-aap main behad uljhaanewaali he
 In fact, Kim Jong Un's half-brother Kim Jong Nam has been living an exile in Macau, China, away from his country for the past several years
 mangalvaar ko qaatilon ne uskaa ye jivan bhi chin liya
 This day, he was waiting for his flight from Kuala Lumpur to Macau, when he sprayed on his face
 isi dauraan use zahreeli sui bhi chubhoi gai, lekin isse pehle ki koi kuch samaj paata, donon mahilaayein bheed main gum ho gayi
 Unfortunate from this attack, Kim Jong Nam complained to the police and airport staff there and informed them about the attack and he was immediately given medical aid
 magar, afsos agle chand minuton ke andar hi unki jaan chali gai
 As soon as the information was received, the police arrived and searched the CCTV footage
 uske binah par hi police ne naa sirf donon mahilaon kii pahchaan kar lee, balki unhen giraftaar kar liya
 On their trail, the police also caught two more people, while four more North Koreans involved in this conspiracy managed to escape by flying from Kuala Lumpur
 lekin jis tarah se north korea ke raaj parivaar se taalluk rakhanevaale ek shaks kaa qatl hua iske peeche north korea ke hi logon kaa haath hone kii baat saamne ai
 The world is assuming that nobody else but North Korean dictator Kim Jong is behind this murder
 vaise duniya ke is shaq kii kai vajahen bhi hai
 One, Kim Jong has killed many of his relatives and enemies in the past, and his relationship with Kim has not been good either
 yahi vajah he ki naam apane hi desh se dur macau main nirvasit jivan jeene ko bhi majaboor tha
 Even after this, he was killed

 It is reported from the sources that at that time the number of our aircraft there was less than the Pakistani jets

 An innocent child was brutally murdered in Meerut
 bachche kii laash ko eekh ke ek khet se baraamad kiya gaya
 The child went missing two days ago while playing outside the house
 uski hatya ko tantra-mantra se jod kar dekha ja rahaa he
 Sumit Kumar lives in Jatpura village in Meerut
 jouttar pradesh police main sipahihai
 Currently two and a half year old son of Sumit posted in Shamli district went missing while playing outside the house on Tuesday evening
 parijanon ne bachche kii gumshudagi kii report rohata thane main darj karai thi
 On Thursday late evening, the villagers saw the dead body of a child in the reed farm near the pond, which was identified as Harsh, son of Sumit
 maukey par us maasoom kedonon haath kate mili
 There were also bite marks on both the legs
 uskaa galaa ghonta gaya tha
 Head hair was cut
 yahaan tak ki pahchaan mitaane kii niyat se cheharaa bhi kshat-vikshat kar diya gaya tha
 As soon as the news of the incident began, a wave of anger raged all over the village
 gaanv waalon ne police ke saamne hangaamaa bhi kiya
 Villagers are associating this incident with Tantric action
 ve ise maanav bali kaa maamla maan rahe hai
 The police is also not denying this apprehension
 ek police adhikari ke mutabik jis berahami se bachche kii hatya kii gai he use dekhakar lagata he ki iske peeche tantra kriya hi ek kaaran ho saktaa he
 According to the Rohata police station in-charge, Harsha's family members have suspected a family member of the village
 haalanki abhi tak parijanon ne thane main taharir nahin di he
 The police has done postmortem of the dead body of the child and handed it over to the family
 shaq ke aadhaar par do logon ko hiraasat main liya gaya he
 Those who are being questioned -input bhashaa Often it happens that we leave the house with perfume and the scent ends before reaching the office
 isliye ham aapako aaj aise tips de rahe hai jo is khooshbu ko lambey samay tak banaae rakhenge
 Distances will change in proximity, know how to apply dry skin, so keep perfume, apply perfume only when your skin is completely dry
 yani us par pani naa ho
 After drying the water can be applied to the masherizer
 phir parafum lagaaein
 If you apply perfume on dry skin, the skin will absorb it completely
 petroleum jelly se milegi madaagar skin par petroleum jelly lagaai ho or us par parafum lagaate hai to uski khushboo lambey samay tak bani rahati he
 Gleaming teeth tell the secrets of your sex life
 
 
 nahaane ke baad turant lagaaanjab bhi aap nahaate to uske baad aapke porce khul jate hai
 Therefore, after bathing, the body should be dried and applied perfume
 parafum lagaakar haath naa ragadereksar log aisa karte hai ki parafum lagane ke baad use duusare haath se ragadate hai or phir uski khushboo soonghtey hai
 But by doing this, the fragrance of perfume never increases, but it decreases
 kalai par parafum lagaaein or use vaise hi chhod den
 This keeps the fragrance for a long time

 Premium charges apply!! Prime Minister Narendra Modi was thinking ahead in the great moment of bjp's huge victory in Uttar Pradesh
 unke dimag main 2019 kaa aam chunaav nahin tha
 They were thinking about the next generation
 paanch main se chaar rajyon kii satta par bhaajapa ke kabiz hone kaa nateeja jis din aayaa, uske agle din modi ne dilli sthit party mukhyalay main apane utsaahi samarthakon se kaha, ''main paanch rajyon ke chunaav parinaamon ko nae bharat kii buniyaad ke rup main dekh rahaa hum‚Äîek aisa nayaa bharat jo 35 saal se kam umr ke 65 fisadi yuvaaon or jaagruk mahila samoohon kaa bharat hoga
 a new India where the poor man is looking for an opportunity to do something instead of asking for something
 " ise unke agle chunavi prachaar ke naare ke bataur na dekha jaae, iske liye aage unhone apni baat saaf kii, ''main chunavi ganit ke hisaab se nahin jeeta hum
 My goal is 2022, not 2019, to complete 75 years of India's independence in 2022
 hamaare paas bharat ko badalane main yogadan dene ke liye sirf paanch saal shesh hai
 "those who have worked close to Modi say that they do not have a meaning but they do what they intend
 ve duniya ke kuch aise netaaon main shumaar hai jo soshal media ke maharathi hai, to ve apni website par adhiktar baaten kehete or karte hai
 The same day a new app was uploaded on the Prime Minister's website asking people to pledge, which clearly had the shadow of Martin Luther King Jr
's famous speech titled "I Have a Dream" (I have a dream)
 us ap main logon se aahvaan kiya gaya he ki ve shnae bharaty kaa hissaa bane jise ''bharat ke sabhi or har aadmi kii takat se bal milegaa, ek aisa bharat jo navachaar sanchalit hoga, kathor mehnat or srujanaatmakataa se aage badhegaa, ek aisa bharat jahaan shanti, ekta or bhaichara hoga or jo bhrashtachar, aatankwaad, kaale dhan or gandagi se mukt hoga
 ‚Äúall this is to be done by 2022 when India completes 75 years of independence
 is ap par aap agar ''tech da plage" (sankalp len) kaa batan dabaate hai to yah aapako ek aise pej par le jaataa he jiskaa hashtag he iaimanuindia or us par nimna sankalp likhe hai jin par sahi kaa nishaan lagaana heru bhrashtachar-mukt bharat ke paksh main khadaa hona, svachh bharat kii disha main kaam karnaa, cashles lenden ko badhaava dena, maadak padaarth mukt bharat ko sunishchit karnaa, mahilaon kii aguai vaale vikaas ko protsaahit karnaa, prakruti or prakritik sansadhano kaa sangrakshan, viklaangataaon vaale logon ko sahyog, shanti, ekta or sadbhaavna ke liye kaam karnaa tathaa rojgaar srujak bananaa na ki rojgaar talashne vaala
 His critics dismiss such claims by saying that Modi is once again selling dreams to the people and that it is only a lavish deposit that he is pushing by 2022 on the promise of "good days"
 inamen haalanki sabase katu aalochak bhi yah baat sweekaar karenge ki bharat ke rajnatik paridrishy par modi ab ek prabhutvkaari shakhsiyat ke rup main ubhar kar aa chuke hai isliye ve jo bhi sankalp lenge, use gambhirtha se liya janaa hoga
 In recent years, there have been few leaders who have had such electoral successes as Modi ‚Äî after achieving a huge majority in 2014, it is a marvel to achieve a blistering victory in the country's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, in the midst of their tenure
 ve haalanki janata ke bade hisse ko sambodhit kar rahe the lekin unke dimag main yah baat bani hui thi ki uttar pradesh kii chunavi kamyaabi is baat kii maang karti he ki usase upji nai chunautiyon par unhen dhyaan dena hoga
 To the top bureaucrats congratulating him on the victory, Modi said the next day of Holi, "our commitment has become bigger as Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand do not come in the best administered states
" hamen isamen fark daalana hoga or yah sabhi ke liye ek chunauti he
 "the Prime Minister was sufficiently aware that in view of the growing aspirations of the people, they would have to perform across the country
 jaisaa ki ek adhikari ne kaha, ''ab tak jitani bhi ghoshnaaen kii gai hai, unke hisaab se hamaara agenda kaaphi vyapak he
 It has to be implemented properly
 haalia chunavi jeet hamen or zyada vachanabaddhata se aisa kar paane main sakasham banaaegi
 "those who know Modi well say that even after the victories in the local elections in Maharashtra and Odisha, his reaction was equally calm
 unhone ek sahyogi se kathith rup se kaha tha, ''meraa sara jor or shiddat is desh ke vikaas par he, na ki aisi chunavi jeeton par
 "A top official says that it is not that the Prime Minister is going to take some bold decisions for economic reforms on the pretext of victory in the assembly elections
 unhone kaha, ''unke liye sudhaar rosemara chalane vaali ek prakriya he
 But the victory in the assembly elections, especially in Uttar Pradesh, has convinced them that they are on the right track
 ab ve 100 fisadi aashwast ho chuke hai ki unhen zyada se zyada garibon ke haq main khadaa rahanaa he
 "those who are worried that Modi may suddenly bend from the middle to the left and get caught in populism, his fears may also be unfounded
 modi ne jis nae bharat kii baat kahi he, uskaa khaakaa ab bhi saamne aana baaki he lekin ek saaf samajhadaari he ki pradhanmantri ab sabsidi or revadigoon vaali samskruti se dur ja rahe hai
 This is the strongest confirmation of the new reforms to be adopted
 iske alaava yuvaaon se yah kahana ki ve rojgaar maangane kii bajaae rojgaar paidaa karen, ek or sanket he
 They want this country to move away from the culture of dependence on government jobs and they are moving towards ending the system of reservation based on caste and communities
 apane vijay sambodhan main modi ne kaha tha, ''is desh ke garibon ne ab aise netaaon ko pasand karne kii maansikta tyaag di he jo unhen kuch detaa ho
 Instead, the poor man is trying to progress through hard work
 vah kah rahaa he ki mere liye avasar paidaa karo, main mehnat se use paal-pos kar bada kar duungaa
 "during his interactions with party workers and officers, Modi does not forget to count one thing said by Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay
 bhaajapa aresas netaa rahe upaadhyaay kii 100veen jayanti manaa rahi he
 Upadhyaya used to give an example that if a person who does not know swimming falls into a well, then the words of consolation will be of no use
 isaki bajaae kisi ko use khinch kar baahar nikaalnaa hoga
 One condition of this is that the person who falls in the well should give a lot of life to save himself
 apni takat kaa puraa istemaal kare
 Modi believes that the role of the government is to take out the poor man by drowning him in the well of despair, but in doing so, the government must also ensure that the person being helped, instead of being completely dependent Whether or not he is working hard to help himself
 aarambh main yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki sabsidi or riyaayaten sahi logon tak pahunch paa rahi hai yaa nahin, pradhanmantri ne jandhan-aadhaar-mobile yani jam kii tikdi kaa sahaara liya he
 The Prime Minister has made a small revolution in terms of subsidies and benefits to the poor through 25 crore bank accounts opened under Jan Dhan, biometric identification and mobile phones
 pratyaksh laabh hastantaran (debiti) pranali ne sunishchit kiya he ki sabsidi sidhe labhaarthi ke bank khate main bheji jaae taaki isse risaav or bhrashtachar khatm ho sake
 Under the DBT so far, over 84 crore schemes and programs have benefitted more than one and a half lakh crores to 32 crore beneficiaries
 se zyada kii dhanrashi hastantarit kii ja chuki he
 The most vivid example of this is the distribution of LPG cylinders in the country
 kareeb dedh karod log aise the jinhone sabsidi chhodie kii pradhanmantri kii apil ko suna or mana
 1,800 crore on its own
 kii salanaa bachat hone lagi
 Subsequently, the government under DBT system 3
 4 karod farji conection khatm karwaae, jisase bachat main baari ijapha hua
 Under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala scheme, the government gave gas connections to 1
5 crore families living below the poverty line, in which the cost of installation was waived and the first cylinder was released
 uttar pradesh main baari sankhya main bipiel pariwaron ko iskaa laabh mila jiske kaaran adhiktar mahilaon ne chunaav main bhaajapa ko vot diya
 Modi's dream of a new India by 2022 rests on how he performs in more than 100 schemes he has implemented
 niti ayog ke siio amitabh kaant bataate hai ki modi ne input or output kii bajaae sara dhyaan nateezon par dena shuru kar diya he
 The Prime Minister chairs the meeting of the NITI Aayog every quarter, where they review all the schemes and also suggest solutions where there is a shortage
 amitabh kaant kehete hai, ''unki vishaal drushti ke alaava lagaataar navachaar karte rahane kii unki samathrya or kade faisle lene kii unki ichhashakti unhen chote-chote vivaranon main le jaati he or vikaas main chalaang lagane ke liye ve praudyogiki ke istemaal kii baat karte hai
 "despite this, the biggest blow to Modi is the bureaucracy, along with some cabinet men
 ab bade kaaryakramon ke liye modi ko ucchstareey profeshnalon kii madad leni hogi
 The UPA government had hired Nandan Nilekani for the implementation of the Aadhaar card and the success of that program is in front
 modi ko apane nae bharat kii drushti saamne rakhni chahie or kriyanvayan ke thos lakshya tay karne chahie
 More important, however, is the question of how many jobs will be generated by these schemes, so that the unemployment crisis is over, which has affected the economy despite the healthy growth rate

 The poor have expressed their faith in Modi, it is because they believe that the rich have finally suffered as a result of their actions

 Due to the recent electoral gains he has made, analysts have started comparing him to Indira Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru
 sawaal uthta he ki bharat ke netaaon kii paant main modi aaj kahaan khadey hai? rajnatik vishleshak yogendra yadav maanate hai ki modi ne itnaa to tay kar diya he ki rashtriya raajnneeti main bhaajapa ab sabase taqatvar party ban chuki he
 By strength, they mean the power gained with legitimacy ‚Äî today Modi has the barbaric power of popular mandate
 netritv ke maamle main yadav kehete hai ki modi ab indira gandhi kii jagah lene ko taiyaar hai
 The Prime Minister has sold his share of the story in a convincing manner and persuaded the people that he stands with national interest and is well above the few battles in which the other parties are entangled
 nehru memorial kvaujium or librari ke nideshak shakti sinha, jo atal bihari vaajapeyi ke nijee sachiv rah chuke hai, maanate hai ki modi koi yathasthitivaadee netaa nahin hai balki parivartankaree shakhsiyat hai
 Unlike Vajpayee, Modi believes in a sharp grip on the administration
 drushti ke maamle main sinha maanate hai ki modi indira kii bajaae nehru ke zyada kareeb hai
 If Nehru had dreamed of modern India, then Modi, who is electoral, is putting forth his dream of a new India
 ve ek mahatvakankshi desh ke saath apni taal baitha rahe hai or apane ko zyada se zyada sweekaarya bana rahe hai
 Modi is also trying to break the stereotypes of caste and community and he is willing to take tough decisions in the matter of selection of leaders
 punjabi mul ke baavjood unhone manoharlal khatter ko haryana kaa mukhyamantri bana diya
 He made Devendra Fadnavis the chief minister of Maharashtra while avoiding Maratha clutches
 ek gaiyr-adivasee netaa raghubar das ko unhone jharkhand kaa mukhyamantri banaaya
 Despite this, Modi's relationship with the RSS is simple ‚Äî almost like a partnership in which he ensures that the Sangh is not cut off from his decisions
 unke aalochak kehete hai ki modi apane mul main ab bhi hindutv ke darshan se bandhe hue hai or chetavanee dete hai ki sahi vakt aane par ve use lagu karenge
 He points to Modi's silence when divisive communal issues arise
 unhen yah bhi dar he ki bahut zyada takat modi ko taanashaah bana degi
 So, is Modi emerging as the new visionary leader of India who will continue to rule this country like Nehru and Indira for years or will he continue to cheat even further? Howard Gardner, a Harvard psychologist, wrote in his famous book Leading Minds: An Anatomy of Leadership that leaders relate themselves to stories that are central to a society's understanding of life
 gardenar kehete hai ki ek kaamyaab aakhyaan is baat par nirbhar karata he ki ''netaa ke apane kriyalap or jivan us kahani ke bhaavon ko pratibimbit kar rahe hai yaa nahin
 "he then counts five qualities at the heart of a leader's success: the ability to tell a story convincingly and tell it confidently; the ability to draw that story into one's own life; a deeper understanding of his audience; to build and build a collaborative organization The energy required to keep up; and the skills needed to continuously exploit technical expertise
 modi main ye sab gun hai or inase kahin zyada bhi he
 With great success in 2014, he created a narrative that he is the only one who can get this country out of economic disrepair
 gujarat main teen baar mukhyamantri rahane ko unhone vikaas kaa model kahkar bechaa
 His own life was an example of a modest beginning with a chaiwala, after which he left the family and devoted himself to the organizational work of the RSS
 tabase lekar ab tak unhone jabardast urja kaa mujahiraa kiya he or apane kaam ko karne main praudyogiki kaa sakshamkaari prayog kiya he (ve aisa apni chunavi reliyon main karte rahe, yaad karen unke apane 3di hologram)
 Gardner speaks of three types of leaders where such qualities are found consistently: sight, innovator and common
 saamaanya netaa ve hote hai jo shaayad hi kabhi yathasthiti ko chunauti de pate hai or ve apane sadasyon ko hi shashakt karke santusht bane rahete hai taaki agrgati jari rah sake
 They say of innovative leaders that they are leaders who take up an old narrative and give it a new twist and with the help of it change the society
 inke ulat drushtaa netaa durlabh hote hai
 According to Gardner, the vision is that which is not satisfied with "connecting oneself to an existing narrative or to reviving an old narrative of a recent and distant past
" yah shaks vastav main ek nayaa aakhyaan gadhata he, jisase bahut se log pehle se parichit nahin hote or vah is kahani ko sampreshit kar paane main aanshik kamyaabi hasil kar letaa he
 "if you look at this criterion, Modi has indeed created a narrative and he seems to be on the threshold of being called a vision
 iske baavjood bharat kii janata se isaki pushti tabhi hogi jab ve baari bahumat se 2019 kaa chunaav jeet lenge
 If the Opposition does not want to do so, it will have to penetrate much deeper and find out what is the real condition of the performance of the schemes launched by Modi
 modi ke pradarshan kii ek aalochanatmak or tathyaatmak samiksha hi unki vishwasaneeyata ko chot pahunchaa sakati he
 This is more important than spending time on caste and communal manipulation to win elections
 agar unhen modi ko hataanaa he, to unhen vikaas kaa apana ek vishisht aakhyaan saamne lekar aana hoga or logon kii usamen aasthaa jagaani hogi
 At present, it is impossible to stop Modi
 narendra modi ne india today conklev main desh ke samgr vikaas ke liye kai mantra die
 But these mantras of Modi have been rejected by the Congress in a big way as well as targeted at them
 congress netaa shakeel ahamed ne twit kiya, 'modi bilkul sahi hai, unhone pehle 2002 gujarat dange, farji encounter jaise 'afat' paidaa kiye or phir use chunavi phaayde ke liye 'avasar' main badal daalaa

 unhone kaha ki bharat main 200-300 saal pehle naa to ramanavami kaa juluus nikaala jaataa tha or naa hi muharram kii jhankiyaan nikalati thi
 At the end of the 19th century, when nationalism was emerging in India, the British gave money to goons and fundamentalists and religion was brought to the streets
 mohammad saleem ne kaha ki iskaa nateeja ye hua ki agle 100 saalon zyadatar dange muharram juluus ke dauraan hue or isaki shuruyaat kanpur main muharram juluus se hui, kyonki hindu iskaa virodh kar rahe the

 Dr
 Praveen Togadia, the international president of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, is once again in the news
 pehali baar togadiya ko media ke saamne apane encounter kaa dar bataakar subakte hue dekha gaya
 This form of Togadia is unfavorable to his image created between the media and the public so far
 togadiya apane bhadakaau bhaashanon or alpsankhyakon ke khilaaf aag ugalane ke liye zyada jane jate hai lekin aaj jab wo media ke saamne aae to unke nishane par na to alpsankhyak the or na hi unki chir pratidwandvi congress
 Rather, Togadia was seen pointing out the fear of his encounter with his own central government
 togadiya bachapan se hi rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se jude rahe hai or sarjan hai jo khud kaa aspataal bhi chalaate hai
 Dr
 praveen togadiya kaa janm gujarat ke amarelli main 1956 main hua tha
 He was born in a Saurashtra farmer family and comes from the Patel community
 10 varsh kii aayu main ve ahmedabad chale gaye or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh main shaamil ho gaye
 He came to Ahmedabad from Amreli for studies
 wo bachapan se hi padhane main awwal rahe
 At this age, he also joined the Sangh and going to the Sangh branches became one of his regular routines
 sangh kaa kaamkaaj or padhai saath-saath chalati rahi
 He was a student of Togadia Medical and he completed his first MBBS and then MS
 16 saal kii umr main yani 1971 main ve rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke purnakalik swayamsevak ban gaye
 The young Togadia started his life as a volunteer under the guidance of RSS pracharak Rameshwar Paliwal Ray
 baad main unhen sangh ke hi anushangik sanghathan vishwa hindu parishad kii jimmedaari di gai
 Togadia joined the VHP in 1983 at just 27 years of age
 ram mandir andolan main unki sakriy bhoomika dekhte hue unhen viechpi kaa mahasachiv banaaya gaya or ashok singhl ke dehanth ko baad togadiya viechpi ke adhyaksh bane
 Since then, he has remained in this position

 The organization, which works for Hindus at social, religious and political levels in India and abroad, has about two million members

 ahmedabad main unhone dhanvantari aspataal kii sthapana bhi kii he
 Dr
 Praveen Togadia is considered a staunch Hinduist leader
 ve aksar apane bhadakaau bayanon ke liye khabaron man rahete hai
 Togadia had been in a lot of controversy for his Trishul initiation program in the Vajpayee government
 us samay gujarat main sarkaar kisi kii bhi ho lekin togadiya vahaan badi takat hua karte the
 Togadia's status can be gauged from the fact that he used to make difficulties for the Vajpayee government due to his statements and programs
 haalanki gujarat main narendra modi ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad unke is rutabe main kami ai or aaj unke bare main kaha jaataa he ki wo haashie par dhakel die gaye hai
 Today, the way Togadia looked emotional in the press conference, this pain is being seen in him

 madhya pradesh main congress ne aakhirkaar 15 saal ke baad vanvaas khatm kar liya he
 With the end of 'shivraj', a new era is about to begin in Madhya Pradesh
 sabase badi party banakar congress ne sarkaar banane kaa daawa to pesh kar diya he, lekin rahul gandhi ke saamne abhi bhi ek sabase bada sirdard he
 Two contenders for the post of CM and strong support base of both
 thik yahi haal rajasthan main bhi he
 Who is sitting on the chair? In Madhya Pradesh, there is Kamal Nath working on the land for the last several decades, while Jyotiraditya Scindia is also very active in the state, saving his legacy
 donon ke hi samarthak jeet ke jashn main madahosh hai, lekin taj kiske sir sajega is par ab tak sanshay bana hua he
 The big question in front of the experienced Kamal Nath or the young Sachin Pilatangress High Command is whether he should pursue the experienced Kamal Nath or place a bet on Jyotiraditya Scindia, who is passionate about the youth
 donon hi netaaon ke samarthakon ko yakeen he ki mukhyamantri kii kursi par unka netaa hi kabiz hoga
 Although the two leaders came together on the stage as soon as they realized the victory on Tuesday evening, their physical expressions clearly indicate that both of them are still in a trance
 donon hi abhi tak mukhyamantri koun banegaa, is sawaal par ab tak munh nahin kholaa he
 Both have put the ball in the court of high command and public
 rajasthan main bhi vahi sawalrajasthan main bhi thik yahi haal he
 Here too Sachin Pilot is undoubtedly one of the main contenders for the Chief Minister after his victory, but his acceptance is less than that of Ashok Gehlot
 janaadhar ke saath-saath anubhav bhi mukhyamantri kii res main gahalot ko payalat se kahin aage khadaa karata he
 Gehlot or Sachin Ashok Gehlot has undoubtedly reached Delhi by winning the trust of Rahul Gandhi, but his all-time acceptance in Rajasthan can make his grand return to Jaipur
 idhar donon ke samarthak party mukhyalay ke saamne shakti pradarshan kar party haikaman par prakarantar se dabaav bhi bana rahe hai
 In such a situation, it is getting a little difficult to decide on who to hand over the chair despite the victory in front of the high command
 2019 kii ‚Äòjang‚Äô ko dekhte hue party bhi donon dhadon ko sadhate hue siem kaa chayan karegi
 a list of 122 mlas has been submitted to the Governor in Madhya Pradesh
 shaam chaar baje vidhayak dal kii baithak honi he
 In such a situation, the question is, who will get the good fortune to sit on the Chief Minister's chair

 supreme court ne floor test karaane kaa faisla sunaaya27 november shaam 5 baje tak karaayaa jaae floor testsupreme court ne aaj mangalvaar ko maharashtra maamle par floor test karaane kaa faisla suna diya he
 The floor test is to be conducted by 5 pm on November 27
 khaas baat he ki protem spikar hi sabhi vidhayakon ko shapath dilaayenge or phir floor test bhi karaayenge
 All parties will also provide information about their whip to the Protem Speaker
 ab aise main sawaal uthta he ki protem spikar koun banegaa
 By convention, the senior-most member of the House is appointed as the Protem Speaker
 sabase adhik baar chunakar aae vidhayak ko protem spikar banaaya jaataa he, jise rajyapal manonit karte hai
 Now the question arises as to whether the tradition will be followed in making a Protem Speaker
 6 naam sujhaaye gaemaharashtravidhansabha main varishthata ke aadhaar par 6 naam rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari ko bhej die gaye hai
 Among them, Balasaheb Thorat of Congress is first and Kalidas Kalmar of BJP is also in second place
 in donon netaaon ke alaava congress ke kasee padavi, bahujan vikaas agadi party ke hitendra thakur, purv spikar or ensipi neti dilip walase patil or bijepi ke babban pachpute ke naam rajyapal ko bheje gaye hai
 Although Balasaheb Thorat has been elected by the Congress as the leader of the Legislative Party, in this sense he is unlikely to become a pro tem speaker
 pichley saal 2018 main karnataka vidhansabha main bhi aisi hi sthiti bani thi
 Then Governor Vajubhai Vala elected BJP leader KG Bopaiah as the Protem Speaker while RV Deshpand of Congress was the most experienced MLA in the House
 5 ahm kadamakal buudhvaar kaa din maharashtra vidhansabha ke liye kaaphi ahm rahane vaala he
 After the order of the Supreme Court, 5 important works are to be done in the House tomorrow
 pehla kadam-protem spikar kaa chunaav hoga
 Second step - the Governor will administer the oath to the Protem Speaker
 teesraa kadam- protem spikar navnirvaachit vidhayakon ko shapath dilaayenge
 Fourth step - Voting will be held in the House for floor test
 paanchvaan kadam- voting ke parinaamon kaa elaan karenge protem spikar
 Who is Proteome speakerprotem is a shortened form of the Latin word Pro Tempore in the word Protem
 is shabd kaa arth hota he- 'kuch samay ke liye
 The Governor appoints the Protem Speaker in the Legislative Assembly and is appointed until the Assembly elects its permanent Speaker (speaker)
 protem spikar navnirvaachit vidhayakon ko shapath dilwaataa he or shapath grahan kii puri prakriya inhen kii dekharekh sampann karai jaati he
 Till the time the mlas take oath in the House, they are not considered a part of the House
 isliye sabase pehle vidhayakon ko hi shapath dilaai jaati he
 When the legislators are sworn in, then they elect the speaker of the assembly
 sansadeey parampara ke mutabik rajyapal sadan main varishthatam sadasyon main se kisi ek ko protem spikar ke liye chunate hai
 The same system is for the Lok Sabha apart from the Legislative Assembly
 aam aadmi party ke andaramcha ghamasanathmane kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 Sources are quoting that Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan may be removed from the council in the party's national council meeting to be held on March 28
 bataaya jaataa he ki donon ke naam kaa prastaav khud arvind kejariwal karne vaale hai, jabaki voting ke baad is par faisla kiya jayega
 According to the information, during this time, the party's national convenor Arvind Kejwariyal will not preside over the meeting, proposing the name of Kumar Vishwas for the post of president
 jabaki yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan ko rashtriya parishad se baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya jayega
 Significantly, many mlas from Delhi will attend this meeting, but out of this, only 6 mlas have the right to vote during the meeting
 isse pehle arvind kejariwal ko rashtriya sanyojak pad se hataane ke liye sajeesh rachane ke aaropon ke bich yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan ko 4 march ko party ke PAC se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya tha

 isse aise kshetron main internet seva pahunchaai jaaegi, jahaan aam taur par yah seva pahunchaana mushkil he
 Muhammad Gowdat, business innovation vice president of Google x Research Lab, said at a conference organized by the Indian Association of Software Industry Association of Software and Services Companies last week, about 4 today
 5 arab logon tak internet seva hameshaa uplabdh nahin he
 These balloons will float in that part of the atmosphere at an altitude of 60 thousand feet above the earth and they will remain unaffected by natural disasters
 ye usee praudyogiki se internet uplabdh karaayenge, jis praudyogiki se mobile phone ke jariye karaayaa jaataa he
 These balloons will float in the atmosphere from east to west or west to east direction and internet will be continuously available in the area under its control
 google ko aise hajaaron baloon tainaat karne honge
 He said that this service could start by next year
 unhone kaha, ham samajhate hai ki 2016 tak ham ek vanijyik model shuru kar denge, jisase ham dharti ke prayek inch tak apni seva pahunchaa denge
 This service will be cheaper than the tower erecting model
 sirf bharat main hi yadi har ek naagarik tak internet seva pahunchaani ho, to do lakh se adhik tower khadey karne honge
 The network of towers is however damaged in many natural disasters
 abhi bharat main sirf 25 fisadi aabaadi hi internet kaa upyog kar paa rahi he

 Both considered the poster-boy of Pakistani cricket as a socialist in a highly arrogant, capricious manner and dismissed him as a marginal player in the turbulent politics of Pakistan
 aaj, pakistan ke ye donon sabase nami gharaane‚Äîsharif or bhutto khandaan‚Äîbhrashtachar ke aaropon main gahare dhanse hai or siyaasi vanvaas main pahunch gaye hai
 At the same time, Imran is frozen in the Prime Minister's residence and office at Constitutional Avenue in Islamabad
 is saal agast main jab unhone pakistan kii kaman sanbhali, to team modi ne bhi aisi hi gafalat kii
 He considered Imran to be merely a puppet of the mighty Pakistani army, which would be at the headquarters of the military rulers of Rawalpindi
 (shaayad vahaan tak to yah sahi tha
 ) He also believed that the new Prime Minister would be overwhelmed by the disastrous economic conditions of the country and would have to obey the army in matters of security and foreign policy (this was also true
 ) pakistani fouj ke apane puraane ravaie se baj aane ke koi sanket nahin hai, so, bharat ne nai sarkaar ke saath bhi apana vahi purana rukh jari rakhaa ki jab tak aatanki gatividhiyon par lagaam lagane main koi pragati nahin dikhti, koi baatcheet nahin hogi
 (it was unintelligent, because such a policy now seems like a stalled record and refuses to recognize that India has to deal with a new government in Pakistan now
 )pradhanmantri narendra modi ne imran ko jeet par badhai dekar darwaja khulaa rakhane kii jarur saavdhaanee barti
 Imran said that he was ready to "take two steps forward instead of every step of India" to improve the relationship, Modi wrote to him that India would like "good and constructive initiative" to build good neighborly relations between the two Committed
 us bayaan ko antarrashtriya halake main acha mana gaya
 Team Imran also considered it a sign that the Modi government was ready to take the process of the negotiations stalled since 2016
 yahaan tak gend bharat ke paale main thi
 The clashes began after that
 team modi ke kaan khadey ho gaye, jaise hi use pataa chalaa ki punjab ke mantri, purv cricketer navjot singh siddhu ne islamabad main agast main imran ke shapath grahan main shaamil hone kaa nyotaa manjuur kar liya he
 Sidhu was given a place in the front row and Pakistan Army Chief Javed Bajwa hugged him
 siddhu ne khulaasa kiya ki baatcheet main general ne unhen aashwast kiya ki ve kartarpur gurudware se bharat kii seemaa tak corndor banaakar awajahi vija-mukt kar denge
 Sidhu had to face criticism from the BJP and his own party Congress for returning from there, hugging Bajwa
 lekin bharat ke videsh mantralay or khufia agenciyon ne bajva kii peshkash ko gambhirtha se liya
 They must be a bit stunned at the time of its implementation
 pakistan ko yah ehsaas tha ki kartarpur gurdvare kii raah kholane se use na sirf seemaa ke donon taraf sikhon kii hamadardi hasil hogi, balki videsh main apravasiyon ke bich bhi acha sandesh jayega
 Since independence, people of every religion on both sides of the border have been demanding that they be allowed to go to the holy site, which has been difficult to reach since partition
 1947 main donon deshon kii sarkaron ne tirthasthalon par vishesh utsav ke maukon par shraddhaluon ko aane-jane dene ke rajiname par dastakhat kiye the
 For the Sikhs of India, two gurdwaras - Nankana Sahib (birthplace of Guru Nanak) and Panja Sahib in Punjab were kept in this list but not Kartarpur (where Guru Nanak spent his last 18 years)
 saal 1999 se hi dwipaksheeya vaartaon main duusare dharmasthalon ke saath kartarpur kii baat bhi uthaai jaati rahi he lekin pakistan kahata rahaa he ki vahaan ke logon ko bhi is paar utane hi dharmasthalon main jane kii ijaajat di jaae
 The matter got stuck on this
 bharat pakistan kii is nai peshkash ko bhi shankaa kii nigaah se dekh rahaa tha, kyonki hamaari khufia agenciyon ke paas aise kaaphi saboot hai ki haal ke varshon main khalistaani ugravad ke sir uthaane ke peeche pakistan kii khufia agency, inter services intelligence (iesai) kaa haath he
 The groups seeking to make Punjab an independent Khalistan are openly allowed to visit the gurdwaras of Pakistan and also inspire devotees who reach there for this purpose
 bharat ke adhikari neuyork sthit sikh for justise (esaje) gut ko shah dene main iesai kaa haath hone kaa aarope lagaate hai
 This faction is engaged in a campaign to radicalize Sikh youth across the world
 esaje khalistaan banane ke liye 2020 main sikhon kii raishumaari kaa abhiyaan chalaa rahaa he
 Moreover, India's Army Chief Bipin Rawat has also warned of the return of terrorist groups in Punjab in his recent press conference
 yah chetavanee vaaki jaij thi kyonki uske fouran baad 18 november ko amritsar ke paas nirankaari samagam par grenade se hamalaa hua jisamen teen log maare gaye
 The Punjab Police claims that it has evidence of cross-border instructions from the killers
 punjab police kii khufia shakha ne khalistaani aatankiyon ke vibhinn 17 modul ko naakaam kar chuki he or march 2017 se ab tak 83 aatankwaadiyon ko giraftaar kar chuki he
 India's concern was that Pakistan is trying to fuel extremism again in Kashmir besides Punjab
 abhi bhartiya team punjab main pakistani fouj ke iraadon kaa andaja laga hi rahi thi ki imran ne sitambar main modi ko ek chitthee likhi ki ve kashmir (jise ve bharat ke saath pakistan kaa mul mudda bataate hai) or aatankwaad (jo bharat kii chintaa kaa sabab he) samet sabhi latake masalon par aage kadam badhaane ko taiyaar hai
 He suggested that his Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi meet Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj during the United Nations General Assembly meeting "to determine the way forward"
 hamaare videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa ne elaan kiya ki bharat ne nyotaa manjuur kar liya he, lekin ek din baad hi ise khaarij kar diya gaya
 It referred to the "ruthless killing" of Indian security forces in Jammu and Kashmir and the issuance of postage stamps in respect of Pakistan's terrorists who attacked India
 kuch behad talkh andaaj main videsh mantralay kaa bayaan aayaa, "pakistan ke napak agenda kaa khulaasa ho gaya or pakistan ke nae pradhanmantri imran khan kaa asli cheharaa duniya ke saamne aa gaya
 However, largely the reasons for India's first accepting the talks and then immediately rejecting them were not considered legitimate and consistent
 baatcheet ke nyote ko manjuur karne ke ek din pehle antarrashtriya seemaa par seemaa suraksha bal (biguef) ke ek jawan kaa galaa kataa shav mila tha
 The new incident was just that three Jammu and Kashmir policemen were kidnapped and killed
 lekin yah sab to haal ke daur main chalata hi rahaa he
 Then, Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also increased the excitement by making statements like beheading the Pakistani army to the Indian Army
 to, maujuuda vaaradaaten baatcheet tuutane kaa sabab kyon honi chahie thi?dak tikat bhi july main imran ke satta main aane ke pehle jari kii gai thi to, ab us par charchaa kyon kii gai? pakistan ke adhikari baatcheet ko khaarij karne main bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) or aresas ke kattar tatwon kaa haath hone kii baat karte hai
 Imran attacked Modi by tweeting, "I have seen dwarves in big positions all my life, who do not have the vision to see the big picture
" ''jab yah lagane laga ki bharat-pakistan ke rishte phir usee doraahe par aa gaye hai, team imran ne bharat ko phir chankaya
 The Pakistan Foreign Office reported to the Foreign Ministry of India that its government is going to undertake a formal foundation stone laying program for the Kartarpur Gurdwara to the border on November 28, allowing Indian pilgrims to access the gurdwara without a visa
 usne yah bhi kaha ki november 2019 main guru nanak ke 550wein prakashotsav tak corndor bana liya jayega
 The parrot of the Indian government flew in, he had to welcome the initiative
 is par nakaaratmak pratikriya dena berukhi lagata or sikhon kii bhavanaaen aahat ho jaatin
 Modi took a stand to show nobility
 november 23 ko guru nanak ke prakashotsav par ek kaarykram main pradhanmantri ne kaha, "kisne sochaa tha ki berlin kii diwaal dhaha di jaaegi? guru nanak dev ji ke aashirwad se shaayad kartarpur corndor sirf ek corndor hi na rahakar logon ko jodgaye kaa rasta ban jaae
 What was then, a massive program was held to leave Pakistan behind, the foundation stone of the Indian side corridor laid on 26 November by Vice President Venkaiah Naidu
 yah mumbai hamale kii 10veen barsi par pakistan kii ore haath badhaane kaa bada ajeeb-sa mauka lag rahaa tha jabaki padosi desh ne uske shadyantrkariyon ko sajaa dilaane ke liye kuch nahin kiya
 There was indecent clash between state Akali Dal and Congress leaders on the stage in the program as well
 iske vipareet pakistan ne kartarpur kaarykram ko kaamyaab banane main koi kasar baaki nahin chodi or aalaa bhartiya netaaon ko iskaa nyotaa bheja
 Sushma Swaraj refused but said that India was asked to send two Union Ministers Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Hardeep Singh Puri (both Sikhs) to the program
 taaja-taaja amritsar hamale ko dhyaan main rakhkar punjab ke mukhyamantri amarinder singh ne bhi yahi ravaiya apanaya or kaha ki main tab tak seemaa paar nahin jaaoongaa, jab tak pakistan aatank or hinsa khatm nahin kar detaa
 However, he could not convince Sidhu not to go
 pakistan ne is kaarykram main 40 deshon ke rajanyikon ko bhi bulaava bheja tha
 Foreign and Indian journalists (including this writer) were also called
 is kaarykram ko pakistani fouj kaa puraa samarthan jaahir karne ke liye general bajva bhi shilanyas ke vakt vahaan par pahunche or uske fouran baad rukhsat ho gaye
 The program was a bit generic
 khaskar isliye ki is upmahadweep main dharm vibhaajan kaa kaaran banataa rahaa he, vahi ab jodgaye ke kaam aa rahaa he
 To support this initiative, everyone including Imran choked Sidhu's back but Harsimrat's speech touched people's hearts
 unhone puri bhaavana ke saath kaha ki sikh hone ke naate is gurdvare ke darshan kaa mauka bemisaal he
 He said, "this initiative, in the name of Baba Nanak Ji, may be a new beginning for those who have Amritvani," neither a Hindu, nor a Muslim, but an Onkar
 ''baad main imran ne mike sambhala to kartarpur corndor ko aman kii raah bataaya or ve vajahen bataayin ki kaise yah bharat-pakistan ke rishton main nirnaayak sabit ho saktaa he
 He made a fuss that Team Modi should consider, provided it has not already been done
 imran kii daleel sidhi-saadi or nai peedi se mukhaatib he jiske man main bantwaare kaa khauf nahin rah gaya he
 He said that both countries are equipped with nuclear power, so it will be "very stupid" to get into the war because no one will win, only the one who will survive will have to be amputated
 unhone aage kaha ki bharat or pakistan ko mil baithkar apane matbhed dur karne chahie kyonki garibi or aarthik tarakkee jaise kaaphi bade masale hai jinhen donon kshetreey sahyog se hal kar sakate hai
 He also said that issues like Kashmir will have to be resolved through dialogue
 bharat isse bhadak gaya ki imran main kartarpur ke bhaashan main kashmir kaa mudda uthaaya, lekin isaki ek vajah yah thi ki imran ne aatank par kaabo paane kii koi baat nahin kii jo bharat kii mukhya chintaa he
 Imran definitely made some improvements in the press conference with the Indian journalists who arrived there
 is lekhak ne unase poocha ki ve bharat kii chintaaon ko dur karne ke liye kya kar sakate hai? is par imran kaa daawa tha ki aatankwaadiyon ko shah dena pakistan ke haq main nahin he kyonki unka desh khud aatankwaad kaa shikaar he
 He said that after the horrific attack on the school of Peshawar, there is complete political consensus on the National Action Plan prepared in 2015 to curb terrorist groups and such amendments have been made in the constitution to allow early trial against terrorists in military court
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki is maamle main fouj, siyaasi or nyaayik pratishthan ekamat hai
 He also called for a change in the "attitude" of Indian policy-makers and said in a lighter vein that the election season is going on in India, so if India wishes, we are willing to wait till its next general elections
 piem modi ke liye unka bada sandesh yah haih pehle mujhe aajamaa kar to dekhie, agar naakaam hua to khaarij kar dijiega
 Indian officials had reasonable reasons to raise suspicions about his speech
 is baat par jor diya gaya ki aatankwaad par kaabo paane jaise masalon par baton se zyada karrwai karne kii darkaar he
 He says that many Prime Ministers including Nawaz Sharif before Imran have made similar promises but they have failed to show any tax on any front
 iske baavjood, kuch bhartiya jaankaar bataate hai ki kartarpur corndor vaaki kaaphi badi pahal he or janamat taiyaar karne kii jang main badhat lene ke maamle main pariksha kii ghadi thi
 The Kartarpur corridor in Punjab on both sides is being considered as the first major initiative of peace after partition
 yah fal pichley 25 saal se, agar 70 saal se nahin, to pakaa-pakaaya tha or imran fouj ko saath lekar ise tod le gaye
 Of course, there were some bad moments too, which Pakistan could have easily avoided
 masalan, general bajva ko kartarpur main gopal singh chawla se haath milaanaa, jise bharat khalistaani ugravadi maanata he
 Pakistani officials immediately made a clarification that Chawla was the secretary general of Pakistan's Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), which oversees all gurdwaras in the country, hence his presence was legitimate
 chawla kaa daawa he ki vah bhagoda nahin he kyonki bharat main kisi ugravadi yaa aatanki maamle main vah abhiyukt nahin he
 Later Qureshi could not control his language and said that Imran trapped India in Kartarpur's "googly"
 sushamaa swaraj ne is bayaan ko pakistan ke gambhir na hone kaa saboot bataaya
 Nevertheless, it is clear that India fell behind in the Kartarpur case
 yah team modi ke liye pakistan se nibatane ke liye khel badalane kaa ek mauka tha
 Till now, Narendra Modi has continued to play against Pakistan
 2014 main jab unhone satta sanbhali to apane shapath grahan main navaj sharif ko nyotaa dekar ahm pahal kii thi
 But after that he proceeded to the policy of "aggressive defense" against Pakistan on the advice of National Security Advisor Ajit Doval
 is niti kaa hi ek hissaa sitambar 2016 main seemaa paar bahucharchit sargical strike thi jise kashmir ke udi main das din pehle sena ke shivi par hamale kaa badla bataaya gaya
 There was an uncertainty in Pakistan about the extent to which India could go to punish it
 usee saal apane swatantraaa diwas sambodhan main pradhanmantri ne balooch rashtrawaad kaa bhi zikr kiya or bataaya ki vahaan ke logon ne bharat se madad maangi he
 Eight months earlier, in December 2015, Modi broke the protocol and reached Lahore to attend Sharif's granddaughter's wedding
 isse unhen yah kehane kii ek vaazib vajah mil gai ki ve pakistan ke saath shanti sthapit karne ke liye li se ekadam hatakar aage badaae ko taiyaar the lekin pakistan ne lagaataar aatanki hamale karke sirf bevafaayee hi kii he
 Meanwhile, Prime Minister Modi tried to isolate Pakistan on the international stage by strengthening relations with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Iran and some Islamic countries in Central Asia
 america main baraak obama or donald trump, donon raashtrapatiyon se apni dosti ke boote modi pakistan par aatank par kaabo paane kaa dabaav bhi bana sake
 To a lesser extent, India's efforts have put Pakistan on the warning list of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global money laundering watchdog for its failure to overcome terrorist funding
 phir bhi pakistan ne apane pattey badi chaturaai se chale
 When he felt that the US pressure was on him, he completely leaned towards China
 sharif ke kaarykaal ke dauraan fouj ke samarthan se pakistan ne china-pakistan aarthik corndor (seeipisi) kaa qaraar kar liya
 China agreed to invest $ 62 billion on infrastructure projects
 iske tahat paak adhikrut kashmir se lekar baluchistan tak pakistan ke samooche ilaake main rail, sadak, bijli sanyantr or bandargah banane kii pariyojnaayen hai
 This will help China speed up its trade from Gwadar port via the Arabian Sea
 china kaa saath milane par pakistan sanyukt raashtra main jaish-e-mohammad ke mukhiya masood ajahar ko antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit karne kii bharat kii pahal ko rukvaa paaya
 Apart from this, India's membership in the Nuclear Supply Group was also embroiled in the argument that Pakistan deserves it too
 yah alag baat he ki sipiisi kii kaman ke maamle main sharif or bajva ke bich than gai
 The army insisted that responsibility for its safety would remain under him
 kaha jaataa he ki bajva ne sharif se chhootkaraa paane ke liye haal main hue aam chunaavon main imran khan kii madad kii
 So far, Imran has paid this favor by advancing the army's line in security and foreign affairs
 siyaasi sarkaar ke saath hone se fouj ne afghanistan par america se mol-bhav main aage badhkar hissaa liya he
 Even Trump, heavily enraged by Pakistan for "doing nothing", has relented and favored negotiations to establish a reconciliation government in Afghanistan, including liberal Taliban leaders Huh
 haalanki aisa nahin he ki saare turup ke pattey pakistan ke haath main hai
 When Imran Khan took over the reins in August, he inherited a shabby economy
 pakistan aantarik or bahari donon karjon main buree tarah duba hua he or uskaa rajkoshiya ghaataa chah fisadi se upar chalaa gaya he
 The value of the Pakistani rupee is almost half that of the Indian rupee
 uskaa videshi mudra bhandar mushkil se ek maheene ke aaayaaton kaa daam chukaa saktaa he
 He needs about $ 25 billion to get himself out of this mess
 imran kaa pehla mishan bheekh kaa katoraa lekar saudi arab or aarthik madad ke liye china janaa tha
 Saudi Arabia offered $ 6 billion, but China has not yet expressed mercy
 usne ulte unheen par dabaav badha diya, yah kahkar ki apni chunavi reliyon ke dauraan ve sipiisi par sawaal uthaa rahe the
 However, after returning from this trip, his tone changed
 vittiya sahaayta ke liye imran antarrashtriya mudra kosh (iemef) kaa darwaja khatkhatane ko majaboor ho gaye, jabaki yahi vah baat thi jiske liye ve pichhali sarkaron kii aalochana kiya karte the
 anti-pakistan parties have already conferred him with the title of "mr
 u-turn"
 chunki neshnal essembly main imran kii party pakistan taharik-e-insaaf (pitii) ko saaf bahumat hasil nahin he, isliye unhen apane gathbandhan ke bhagidaaron ke saath behad saavdhaanee se vyavhaar karnaa padegaa
 a large number of young people are looking for jobs, in search of jobs that do not exist, so Imran will be most focused on getting rid of the economy of the country
 unhen in tanj bhari afvaahon ke bich apana rasta bananaa or tike rahanaa hoga ki ve apni teesri bivi sufi vidwaan bushara bibi ke jaadu-tone ke kuch zyada hi asar main hai
 Bushra Bibi believes in tantra-mantra and is called Imran's "casper the Ghost", a famous cartoon series character
 haal hi main pakistan muslim lig (navaj) main shaamil hue purv kabina mantri mushahid hossain kehete hai, "imran yaa to shandaar tareeke se kamyaabi chuumenge yaa phir puri tarah naakaam honge
 There has been a lack of clarity in his outlook in the first 100 days and there is still much volatility and uncertainty
 munhajbani baton or kiye gaye kaamon ke bich jabardast faasla he
 So the decision has yet to be made
 '' vidambnaa yah he ki satta main unke in 100 dinon kii akeli badi kamyaabi unki kartarpur kii pahal he
 Even Mushahid believes this
 udhar team modi imran ko lekar jis dekho or intjaar karo kii niti par chal rahi he, vah ulate nattejey dene vaali sabit ho rahi he
 There are no new players in Imran politics
 ve 1996 se siyasat main hai or apane cricket kariyar kii tarah yahaan bhi unhone kaamyaab hone kaa jajba or pakkaa iraadaa dikhaaya he
 They also have a sense of brotherhood and loyalty to a player and are impatient with protocol
 kartarpur main unhone aalochana kaa jokhim uthaakar bhi apane saath aane ke liye siddhu par tarifon ke phool barasaaye or modi kaa koi zikr nahin kiya
 Hindustan should keep these qualities of his personality in mind while dealing with him
 jaisaa ki ek visheshgy kehete hai, "hamen unke saath faujee pramukh ke ardli kii tarah bartaav karnaa band karnaa chahie
 He is the wazir-e-azam of Pakistan and in the past we had talked to him with even weaker Prime Ministers
 saath hi, unhen un kaamon kaa shrey bhi nahin lene den jinke ve hakdaar nahin hai
 "the perpetual precondition of India that - no dialogue till the panic stops - now seems to be unacceptable
" 26 / 11 ke mujarimon ke maamle main pakistan daawa karata he ki gend hindustan ke paale main he
 The magistrate needs the testimony of 27 Hindustani eyewitnesses which Hindustan has not yet been able to provide to bring the case to a swift conclusion
 lashkar-e-taiyaba ke saat sadsy, jinamein uskaa oparations commander jacki-ur-rahamaan lakhvi bhi he, mumbai hamale kii yojana banane or use amal main laane ke liye aaropon kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 But Lakhvi was released on bail citing no evidence and has been underground since then
 fedral investegative agency (exiye) ke purv pramukh or 26 / 11 se us vakt jude rahe tarik khosa ne pakistan ke angreji akhbaar don main 2015 main likhe ek lekh main is maamle ke halaat kaa khulaasa kiya tha
 He wrote, "pakistan will have to account for the devastation of Mumbai, which was launched as a plan from its land
 
 
 maamla bahut lambey vakt se ghitus rahaa he
 The repeated evictions of the defendants, the repeated change of trial judges and the murder of the prosecutor of the case and the simultaneous overturning of several key witnesses by their original statements have been a serious setback for those who have been arrested
 ''nyaayik aad ke peeche chhipane ke liye hindustan ko pakistan kii laanat-malaanat kerani chahie
 Even Imran refused to make any promises or statements in the case, saying that "because this issue is under consideration of the court
" '' 26 / 11 par kadam peeche khinchne ko lekar videsh mantralay ko hindustani janata ko or antarrashtriya samudaay ko bhi tazatreen halaat se waakif karwaanaa chahie taaki imran par dabaav banaae rakhaa ja sake
 After the PDP-BJP alliance, which had been in the state for three years, collapsed, it was found that Hindustan stood on crumbling ground in Kashmir
 yahi vajah he ki pakistan kashmir par baatcheet ke liye jor daal rahaa he, kyonki usko bharat kii kamajori kaa ehsaas he
 Governor Satyapal Malik is being criticized for not dissolving the assembly in the immediate term of his term and not giving a chance to the three parties - PDP, National Conference (NC) and Congress - to agree to come together to form the government
 malik ne jo haasyaaspad or betuki vajahen bataayin, unamem aisi vajahen thi ki fax kaam nahin kar rahaa tha or rajyapal ko partiyon kaa sarkaar banane kaa daawa karne vaala patr nahin mila
 Modi further compounded his mistakes in the Valley when Ram Madhav, the bjp's state in-charge, made a strange allegation that the three parties were acting on the instructions of Pakistan
 iskaa makhul udaate hue umr abdulla ne jawaab diya, "pakistani ise kaise bhej sakate the‚Äîfax mashin to chal hi nahin rahi thi
 "by blaming it on Pakistan, the BJP was also somewhere accepting that the influence of Islamabad in the valley has increased once again to the extent of causing trouble
" sena pramukh ravat ne safai di he ki ghati main ghuspaith kaa str neeche aayaa he or sthiti niyantran main he
 But even the Indian Army acknowledges that increasing radicalization has become a serious problem among the youth
 kashmir ko niyantran main laane ke liye surakshabalon par modi sarkaar kii bahut zyada nirbharta ke achche nattejey saamne nahin aa rahe hai or aisa lagata he ki uske idia chook gaye hai
 a military solution for Kashmir will also not work, as the Pakistani military can counter any operation of the Indian Army
 behatar or awwal sainya takat hone ke baavjood kya china ne 2017 main doklam ke takaraav se pair peeche nahin khinch liye the? halaat ko phir se sudhaarney ke liye kashmir main siyaasi hastkshep or kootnithik meljol kii jarurat he
 This is also one of the reasons why it is important to interact with Imran Khan
 bahaanon se unhen tarakaane yaa un par hamalaa karne ke bajaay modi kaa game plan ab yah hona chahie ki samvaad kii prakriya shuru karne kii unki guzarish ko sweekaar kiya jaae
 And then set an agenda to see if they can meet it
 chunki imran ne modi ko saarc kii prakriya dobaaraa shuru karne or islamabad main agali baithak main hissaa lene kaa nyotaa diya he, isliye hindustan ko unhen nishchit baton par apana paksh saaf-saaf rakhane ke liye majaboor karnaa chahie
 In its previous meetings, the SAARC countries agreed to increase connectivity among themselves through the rail network, to cooperate on energy and to allow each other motor vehicles to cross the border like the European Union (EU)
 pakistan abhi tak rukaawatein paidaa karata rahaa he
 Imran can now be asked if he can put his words on the ground
 aatankwaad or aapraadhik karrwai ko lekar saarc kii ek sandhi he jis par pakistan ne amal nahin kiya he; ye sab mudde bhi unke saath uthaae ja sakate hai
 In recent years, India has lost an important leaf ‚Äî promoting people-to-people contact ‚Äî and the reason for this has been the visa policy of sanctions
 ab kartarpur ke asar kaa muqabla karne ke liye bhartiya ucchayog ko kahin zyada udaar vija niti kaa anusaran karnaa chahie or pakistan ko bhi aisa karne ke liye majaboor karnaa chahie
 It is at Kartarpur itself that he should once again take the initiative to decide the modalities of visa-free system
 vahiin, yah bhi pakkaa karnaa chahie ki charampanthi tatv iskaa durupyog na kar saken
 On the Line of Control, it should be asked to take a fresh look at the routes that can be opened, so that the movement between Kashmir on both sides is more free and trade between them increases
 jodhpur or karachi ko jodgaye ke liye munaabaav-khokharapaar rail link main sudhaar kaa samjhauta bhi lambit padaa he
 Then there are big two-way trade agreements, which Pakistan has refused to accept
 inamen bharat ko most faverd raashtra (menen) kaa darja dena bhi shaamil he
 Hindustan should ask Pakistan to sit at the table and solve all this
 shuruyaat ke taur par bharat, pakistan se kah saktaa he ki vah sarhad par vyapaar ke liye apane logistic network par kaam karnaa shuru kare
 India's strategy should be changed from "we are not willing to have any deal with you" to a strategy in which a list of important issues on which India wants to move forward
 hindustan ko imran se yah bhi kehane kii jarurat he ki ham kuch bhi nayaa nahin maang rahe hai or shuruyaat ke liye keval pehle ke samjhauton par hi amal karne kii guzarish kar rahe hai
 Hindustan should try and decide on the basis of Imran's work and accept the challenge of Imran
 unhen sabit karne dijie ki ve nayaa pakistan bana sakate hai
 If they make, then India should strongly support them

 Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan claimed from India Today Group's Mind Rocks 2018 platform that the Ujjwala scheme of Modi government has proved to be a complete success
 vipaksh ke aarope ko khaarij karte hue pradhan ne daawa kiya ki jitne logon ko yojana kaa phayda mila he unamem lagbhag 80 fisadi log kam se kam chaar baar nayaa silendar ishyu kara chuke hai
 Dharmendra Pradhan claimed that the Modi government has helped the poor families of the country under the Ujjwala Gas Scheme with the money collected from tax on oil

 Last month when people were engaged in the lines of banks and Parliament was at a standstill, a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) came which is the latest disclosure of the Central Government's Cess Raj
 aaie jaane kahaan-kahaan se or kul kitne vasule ja rahe hai hamase ses
 
 
 
 1
 Mobile taxis Many people will not know this
 Mobile operators give a special tax on their revenue to reach the villages by phone and internet
 jise universal eksse levi kaha jaataa he
 This tax is only on our telephone bill
 iske kharch ke liye universal obligeshan fund (yuasao fund) banaaya gaya he
 According to the CAG, Rs 66117 crore was raised from this levy between 2002-03 to 2015-16
 jisamen keval 39113 karod rupee yuasao fund ko die gaye
 Will the government answer this question, if the phone has reached the villages then why is this levy being collected and if this money is deposited then why can't it be used to fix the mobile network and stop the call drop
 2
 Education Tax - In 2006-07, a special cess of one percent was imposed on income tax to modernize the level of higher education and secondary education
 2015-16 tak is ses se 64228 karod rupee jutaaye gaye
 The CAG states that for its use, the government neither created any fund nor any scheme was given this money
 agar shiksha ke liye paryaapt dhan he to phir taxpere par boj kyon? desh ko iske istemaal kaa hisaab kyon nahin miltaa?- praathmik shiksha ke tahat sarv shiksha abhiyaan or mid de mile kaa paisa jutaney ke liye inakam tex par do fisadi kaa praathmik shiksha ses bhi lagata he, jiske istemaal ke liye praathmik shiksha kosh bana he
 The fund was not given the entire amount raised between 2004‚Äì15

 Smoke-erasing was created in 2010-11 for clean and smokeless production projects of electricity
 is fund ke vaaste deshi koyale ke khanan or videsh koyale ke aayaat par ses lagaaya jaataa he, jo bijli mahangi karata he
 Between 2010 and 2015, the government raised Rs 15174 crore from this cess but the Energy Fund received only Rs 8916 crore
 alabatta 2016 ke bajet main sarkaar ne iskaa naam badal clin anvyrnment ses karte hue ses kii dar doguni kar di

 research vaala texsieji kii report main ek or ses kii pole kholi gai he
 We hardly know that the government imposes a cess on the import of technologies
 research and deveopment ses kanoon 1986 se lagu hai jiske tahat gharelu takanic ke shodh kaa kharchaa jutaney ke liye takneekee aayaat par 5 fisadi ses lagata he
 The amount of the cess is paid to the Technology Development Board
 1996-97 se 2014-15 tak is ses se 5783 karod rupee jutaaye gaye lekin board ke tahat fund ko mili 549 karod rupee

 sirf yahi nahin
 
 
 
 sadakon ke vikaas ke liye petrol dijal par lagane vaala road deveopment ses bhi puri tarah road fund ko nahi miltaa
 The cesses imposed by the previous governments were neither low nor according to them, the failure was corrected
 lekin modi sarkaar ne apane teen bajaton main teen nae ses thuns die
 Service tax was levied on agricultural welfare cess and Swad Bharat Cess while cars were being provided with 2
 5 fisadi se lekar 4 fisadi tak infrastracchar ses chipak gaya
 In the last two years, the government has never told which projects are going to cess money in the name of cleaning and farming

 The history of the bullet train which failed to run from the first train in 1853 to 2014, is there a history of incomplete development of India? Gandhi, who had seen the whole of India from the third grade, wrote in his book Hind Swaraj that if India had had a network of canals instead of trains, then perhaps this country would have grown more
 lekin darasal ham vikaas ke jaal main fanse rahe or maanate rahe ki trainen chalengi to udyog khulenge, rojgaar aayega or desh nae daur main jayega
 The budget of this time also reminds us that the pace of trains is much slower than it is, the pace of plans is much slower than this
 ham ek taraf bullate train chalaane kii baat karte hai or duusari taraf stesan or dabbe bhi saaf‚àísuthere nahin rakh pate
 On one hand promises to run premium trains like Super Rajdhani and wifi across all the capitals-centuries and on the other hand keep the scope of safety messing with safety

 In such a divided country, trains run under the pressure of politics, not economy

 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ne dadri main peet-petakar ek shaks kii hatya jaisi kuch 'nindaneey' ghatnaon ko sangh se jodne ke aaropon ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki sangh ko anaavashyak 'kathghare' main khadaa kiya ja rahaa he or yah kuch takaton kii sajeesh he
 The Sangh denied that it had demanded a review of the reservation policy and said that the society supports the continuation of it as long as the reservation system is needed
 sangh ne kuch takaton dwaara hindu samskruti or sanghathanon kaa majaak udaane ke ‚Äòvinaashkari prayaason‚Äô ko 'kaaphi nindaneey' qaraar diya
 The Sangh sought to disclose the truth of the allegations in which some forces linked the recent incidents of malignity in the country
 aresas ke sar kaarywah bhaiyaji joshi ne kaha, 'pichley kuch dinon main kuch takatein vibhinn ghatnaon ko sangh se jodakar ise kathghare main khadaa karne kaa prayaas kar rahi hai
 He called it an 'insult' to Hindu society
 unhone ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, hamaara maananaa he ki sangh ko sajeesh ke tahat anaavashyak rup se kathghare main khadaa kiya ja rahaa he
 We have always condemned such incidents, because such incidents are not good for the society
 unhone kaha ki is tarah kii ghatnaon kii tah main janaa jaruri he, taaki sachai kaa pataa chal sake
 Joshi said that the Sangh has been accused in the past as well, but when it went deep, such allegations proved to be false
 tippaniyan In response to a question asked to implement the reservation, Joshi said that if there are any shortcomings, it can be removed
 unhone kaha, jahaan tak samaaj ke liye aarakshan kii jarurat he ise jari rahanaa chahie
 We have said the same thing again and again
 bihar chunaavon se pehle pichley maheene aarakshan niti par bhagwat kii tippanee se raajnneetik tufaan khadaa ho gaya tha
 Joshi said that the Sangh has always been positive in its views and respected the sentiments of everyone
 unhone kaha, ham pichley 90 saalon se samjik jivan main hai or sangh ke khilaaf kisi ne bhi ashishnutaa ke aarope nahin lagaae
 He said, i think it is an insult to Hindu society and it is necessary to understand the positive work of the Sangh in the society
 sangh ne is baat se inkaar kiya ki isane aarakshan niti kii samiksha kii maang kii thi or kaha ki samaaj ko jab tak aarakshan pranali kii jarurat he tab tak vah ise jari rakhane kaa samarthan karata he
 The Sangh termed 'disastrous attempts' by some forces to make fun of Hindu culture and organizations as 'quite reprehensible'
 sangh ne un aaropon kii sachai kaa khulaasa karne kii maang kii jisamen kuch takatein haal main desh main hui nindaneey ghatnaon ko usase jodatii hai
 Bhaiyyaji Joshi, the RSS head of action, said, 'in the last few days, some forces are trying to bring various incidents to the forefront by linking them to the Sangh
 ' unhone ise hindu samaaj kaa 'apmaan' qaraar diya
 He said at a press conference, we believe that the Sangh is being unnecessarily put in the dock under the conspiracy
 hamane hameshaa is tarah kii ghatnaon kii ninda kii he, kyonki aisi ghatnaayen samaaj ke liye thik nahin hai
 He said that it is necessary to get to the bottom of such incidents, so that the truth can be known
 joshi ne kaha ki pehle bhi sangh par aarope lagate rahe hai, lekin jab gaharaai main gaye to aise aarope jhuthe sabit hue
 The comments aarakshan ko lagu karne ke silsile main puche gaye ek sawaal ke jawaab main joshi ne kaha ki agar koi khami he to use dur kiya ja saktaa he
 He said, it should continue as far as reservation is needed for the society
 hamane yahi baat baar-baar kahi he
 Bhagwat's remarks on the reservation policy last month before the Bihar elections sparked a political storm
 joshi ne kaha ki sangh apane vichaaron main hameshaa sakaaratmak rahaa he or har kisi kii bhaavana kaa sammaan kiya he
 He said, we are in social life for the last 90 years and no one has made allegations of intolerance against the Sangh
 unhone kaha, main samajhataa hum ki yah hindu samaaj kaa apmaan he or samaaj main sangh ke sakaaratmak kaam ko samajhnaa jaruri he

 com / sjldg7u95c At least 25 of the 60 Indian graduate students at Western Kentucky University were asked to leave their computer science studies after the first semester because they did not meet its entry standards
 media main ai ek khabar main aaj yah jaankaree di gai he
 Due to this step, students will either be forced to return to India or they will have to search for another university in America
 pichley saal garmiyon main bhartee abhiyaan ke baad in chaatro kaa janvari main namakan hua tha or unhen ajukeshan fees main chhot jaise pralobhan diye gayi the
 The university had enlisted the help of international agencies to lure the students who wooed the students through advertisements and for this they were also paid a per student rate from the university
 uniwarsity ke computer science paathyakram ke chairman james gairi ne kal kaha tha ki lagbhag 40 chaatr unke pravesh ke liye jaruri maapdandon ko puraa nahin karte
 The New York Times quoted him as saying that some students would be allowed to remain in the course while 25 out of about 60 students would have to leave the course
 unhone kaha ki chaatro ko vishay main bane rahane kii anumati dena acha dhan galat jagah lagane jaisaa hoga kyonki ve computer program ke bare main likhane main asamarth hai jo paathyakram kaa jaruri hissaa he
 Meanwhile, Aditya Sharma, chairman of the Indian Students' Union of Western Kentucky University has expressed concern about the future of the students
 dilli main bheekh maangana ab jurm nahin he
 But you will be surprised to know that even after a month of the High Court order, about 500 beggars are illegally lodged in the Delhi government jail
 8 agast ko dilli hoicourt ne bhikhaariyon ko raahat dete hue bhikshavriti ko aparaadh kii shrenee se hataa diya tha 
 This order of the court also shows that about 478 convicted prisoners are illegally lodged in the Beggars Jail in Tahirpur of Delhi Government
 aadhe se zyada kaidi leproce or tibi kii bhayankar bimariyon se grasit hai
 Some are punished in 6 months and some in 8 months
 lihaaza sajaa puri hote hi unhen choda jayega lekin, wo kahaan jaaenge, kya karenge abhi tak policy ke str par sarkaar ne koi koi plan nahin banaaya
 Society did not adopt them because of severe diseases
 ab begar act khatm hone ke baad kanuunan unhen ek din bhi jail main nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 But even after the abolition of the Begar Act, the Delhi government has no answer under which law they have been kept in jail
 kanoon kahata he ki sajaa puri hone par unhen chhodana hi hoga
 Social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam argues that beggars are not willing to leave the house
 ye hoicourt ke aadesh ke pehle se yahaan rakhe gaye hai
 He said that the High Court's abolition of the act of begging in Delhi is only to save the people who are begging under compulsion, while the gangs are still begging to bend hands and feet and for this the provision of punishment in law is also
 lekin ek cabinet bill laane par vichaar ho rahaa he jisase unako laabh milegaa jo majaburi main bheekh maang rahe hai
 The government is considering providing skill development training for them
 saath hi aise logon ko 250 rupee pratidin dene par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Delhi's largest and only functional home (where convicted beggars are placed) is on the verge of closure at the end of the Homebegger Act on the verge of closure
 dilli main bhikhaariyon ke liye 11 grih hai jahaan par unhen rakhaa jaataa he
 In this beggars live, eat, and counseling
 inamen 2180 kaidiyon ke rakhe jane kii kshamta he
 Since begging is not a crime, now these houses are deserted
 kul 10 grih ko philhal ke liye band kar diya gaya he
 Only 1 home located in Tahirpur has 478 convicted prisoners
 har grih kaa bajet alag-alag hota he
 Please tell that it costs about 5 crore rupees annually to maintain the house of Tahirpur
 dilli sarkaar in grih par har saal 2959
 Allot 1 lakh (budget of about 30 crores)
 kul 337 karmchaaree in begar home kii dekh-rekh ki liye niyukt kiye gaye hai
 Now the question is, what work will the government take from them? Let me tell you that according to government statistics, there are about 4,13,670 beggars in India, which includes 2,21,673 males and 1,91,997 females
 kya kahata he hoicourtdilli hoicourt ne sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha ki bhikhaariyon ko kisi bhi prakaar kii sazaa dena moolbhoot adhikaron ke khilaaf he, isliye unke khilaaf kisi bhi tarah kaa aapraadhik maamle main sajaa nahin di ja sakati
 The court said that any hungry person has the right to ask for bread under Right to Speech
 darasal bheekh maangate hue agar koi bhi vyakti pakadaa jaataa tha to use 1 se 3 saal kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan tha, jo ab khatm ho gaya he
 When the beggar was caught for the second time, there was a provision for a sentence of up to 10 years, but now it has been abolished after the High Court order
 mumbai privansion of bager act 1959 ko dilli main 2 june 1960 ko lagu kar diya gaya tha
 Beggarship has been removed from the category of crime, so the way beggars used to carry fingerprints when they were first caught can no longer be done

 Brajreshwari Shaktipeeth of Kangra is one such abode of the mother where all the grief of the devotees is overcome by having a glimpse of their suffering mother
 yah 52 shaktipeethon main se maa kii wo shaktipeeth jahaan sati kaa dahinaa vaksh gira tha or jahaan teen dharmon ke pratik ke rup main maa kii teen pindion kii puja hoti he
 Seeing the holy rays of the sun God bathing the mountains and the huge mountain range of Kangra glittering like gold upon the arrival of dawn, it seems as if an accomplished jeweler has put a sheet of gold on the valley
 aisa manoram drishy ki ek pal ko prakruti bhi apane is rup par itaraa uthe
 Nagpur Dham of Kangra, one of the Shaktipeeths of the mother, says about the abode of Mother Brajreshwari Devi, when mother Sati gave up her life by jumping into the yagna kund of her father Raja Daksha after getting angry with the insult of Shiva by her father
 Then, the angry Shiva roamed the whole creation with his body
 shiv kaa krodh shant karne ke liye bhagwaan vishnu ne apane chakra se mata sati ke sharir ke tukade-tukade kar die
 Wherever this piece of body fell on the earth, it was called Shaktipeeth
 manyata he ki yahaan mata sati kaa dahinaa vaksh gira tha isliye brajareshwari shaktipeeth main maa ke vaksh kii puja hoti he
 This Shaktipeeth of Mata Brajeshwari is unique and special in itself because here not only Hindu devotees bow down the head but also devotees of Muslim and Sikh religion come to this temple and offer flowers of their faith
 kehete hai brajeshwari devi mandir ke teen gumbad in teen dharmon ke pratik hai
 The first is a symbol of Hindu religion, whose shape is like a temple, the second is the symbol of Muslim society and the third is the symbol of the dome Sikh sect
 teen gumbad vaale or teen sampradaayon kii aasthaa kaa centre kahe jane vaale mata ke is dham main maa kii pindian bhi teen hi hai
 This first and main pindi, reputed in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple, is that of the mother Brajreshwari
 duusari maa bhadrakaali or teesri or sabase choti pindi maa ekadshi kii he
 It was in this Shaktipeeth of Mother that his supreme devotee Dhyanu offered his head
 isiliye maa ke wo bhakt jo dhyanu ke anuyaayi bhi hai wo pile rang ke vastra dhaaran kar mandir main aate hai or maa kaa darshan pujan kar swayan ko dhanya karte hai
 It is said that any devotee who reaches the court of the mother with true devotion in his mind, his wishes are not complete
 phir chaahe manachaahe jeevanasathi kii kaamana ho yaa phir santan prapti kii laalasaa
 Mother fulfills the wishes of her every devotee
 maa ke is darbar main paanch baar aarti kaa vidhaan he, jiskaa gavaah banane kii khwaahish har bhakt ke man main hoti he
 In this Shaktipeeth of Mother Brajeshwari Devi, Aarti of Mother is done five times daily
 subah mandir ke kapaat khulte hi sabase pehle maa kii shaiyya ko uthaaya jaataa he
 After that, Mangala Aarti of the mother is done in the night makeup
 mangala aarti ke baad maa kaa raatri shringaar utaar kar unki teenon pindion kaa jal, doodh, dahi, ghi, or shahad ke panchamrita se abhishek kiya jaataa he
 After that, the mother is adorned with yellow sandal and she is dressed in new clothes and gold jewelery
 phir chanaa puri, fal or mewa kaa bhoga lagaakar sampann hoti he maa kii praat: aarti
 Here, the mid-day aarti and the ritual offering is kept secret
 dopaher kii aarti ke liye mandir ke kapaat band rahete hai, tab shraddhalu mandir parisar main hi bane ek vishesh sthaan par apane bacchon kaa mundan karavaate hai
 It is believed that by getting the children shaved here, the mother takes away all the disasters of the children's life
 mandir parisar main hi bhagwaan bhairav kaa bhi mandir he, lekin is mandir main mahilaon kaa janaa purna rup se varjit hai
 The idol of Viraje Lord Bhairav is very special here
 Whenever there is any trouble on Kangra, then the tears of this idol and the body starts to sweat
 tab mandir ke pujari vishaal havan kaa aayojan kar maa se aane vaali aapadaa ko taalane kaa nivedan karte hai or yah brajeshwari shaktipeeth kaa chamatkaar or mahima hi he aane vaali har aapadaa maa ke ashish se tal jaati he
 In the afternoon, the doors of the temple are again opened to the devotees and the devotees arrive to seek the blessings of the mother
 kehete hai ekadshi ke din chaaval kaa prayog nahin kiya jaataa he, lekin is shaktipeeth main maa ekadshi swayan maujuud he isliye yahaan bhoga main chaaval hi chadhaaya jaataa he
 After sunset, these pindi are bathed and anointed with Panchamrit again
 laal chandan, phool va nae vastra pahanaakar maa kaa shringaar kiya jaataa he or iske saath hi sany kaal aarti sampann hoti he
 The enjoyment of the evening aarti is distributed among the devotees in prasad form
