 It was later renamed Ranbir Raj Kapoor and eventually he became known simply as Raj Kapoor
 ye he neeli ankhon kaa rahasyakai logon ke liye kapur khandaan kii neeli ankhen bhi rahasy kaa vishay hai

 Shahid Ali prasiddh vakil maajid menon kaa maananaa he ki ilahabaad kaa naam badalane kii kriya praathmik kriya thi ki naam badal diya jaae
 a lot of issues exist in the entire Uttar Pradesh, but the Chief Minister is campaigning for a change of name instead of paying attention to that
 unhone kaha ki ek naam badalane se kitna rajasav kaa nuksaan hota he iskaa andaaza lagaana mushkil he
 Changing the name is not any kind of development work, but the country and the state have to bear the loss of revenue, whose burden falls on the people
 prashanth bhushan
 Prashant Bhushan says that changing the name of Allahabad is completely wrong
 sarkaar kaa ek hi kaam rah gaya he ki jahaan-jahaan muslim naam dikhaai de usko badal do or hindu naam rakh do
 The government wants to spread hatred everywhere and on this they are baking political bread
 jamaane se jab ilahabaad janaa jaataa he to aakhir pareshaani kya he
 If something has to be done, then there are hundreds of issues in Uttar Pradesh due to which the public is completely upset
 lekin unako isse rajnatik phayda nahin hoga, isliye aise mudde uthaate hai jisase unako siyaasi phayda mil sake
 Supreme Court advocate Amitabh Sinha believes that examples of renaming process are found not only in the country but in the whole world
 ye lokapriy sthaneey janabhaawanaaon par aadhaarit hote hai
 Popular public sentiments are represented by democratically elected governments, for example
 trivendram ko tiruvanantpuram, cochin ko kochi, madras ko chennai , kalakatta se kolkata, guahati ko guwahati , bombai se mumbai karnaa
 All the Congress, Left and various regional parties except Bombay completed the renaming process
 amitabh sinhatippaniyan Amitabh Sinha says that as far as the subject of Allahabad is concerned, Allahabad is one of the oldest cities and for thousands of years the Aquarius system has been in operation and the Aquarius is always in Prayag and not in Allahabad
 aitihaasik tathyon ke aadhaar par akbar ne apni paariwarik paramparaon kaa anukaran karte hue punah namakaran prayag se hataakar allahabaad kiya tha
 Prayagraj is, therefore, a perfectly appropriate and timely step in the context of the renaissance of Indianness

 team rahul dwaara taiyaar kii gai ranneeti ke tahat hi rahul ne gujarat chunaav kaa pehla daura puraa kiya
 The line that Team Rahul has set in view of the Gujarat elections, indicates somewhere that the party is going to move forward on the path of soft Hindutva
 siyaasi ranneeti ke tahat hi rahul ke pehle daure main jo bhi kaarykram bane wo hindu dharm ke ird-gird hi ghoomte rahe
 It was already decided by Rahul's visit that no Muslim leader would be around him during Rahul's visit
 puure daure ke dauraan prabharee ashok gahalot, sachiv rajeev saatav, pradesh adhyaksh bharat solanki or youth congress ke adhyaksh raja baraar hi rahul ke saath tasveeron main nazar aae
 Interestingly, the recent Ahmed Patel Rajya Sabha election was the most discussed topic in Gujarat
 is chunaav main jeet ko congress apane kaaryakartaaon kaa manobal badhaane vaala maanati rahi he
 Despite this, Ahmed Patel, the political advisor of Sonia who barely won the Rajya Sabha in Gujarat, did not appear anywhere near Rahul
 sutron ke mutabik, team rahul or khud ahamed patel ne ranneeti ke tahat hi aisa kiya
 In fact, the Congress feels that in the last phase of the last assembly election campaign, Modi, speaking Mian Ahmed Patel, described him as a contender for the Chief Minister and polarized the election
 ab congress ko dar he ki, aane vaale vakt main ek baar phir chunavi prachaar main ye kahkar dhruvikaran kii koshish kar sakate hai ki, congress pichley daravaaje se muslim samudaay se aane vaale ahamed patel ko mukhyamantri bana degi
 That is why the Congress is taking steps by blowing
 aane vaale dinon main khud ahamed patel baar-baar ye bayaan denge ki, wo naa mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar the, naa hai or naa honge
 That is why even though Rahul went to the temple, mosque and gurudwara during campaigning in UP elections, the yatra in Gujarat was planned during Navaratri
 phir rahul ne yatra kii shuruyaat dwarkadhish mandir se puja karke kii, indira-rajeev ke dastakhat vaale mandir ke peedi naame par dastakhat bhi kiye
 During his visit to Gujarat, Rahul visited various temples
 yatra or bhaashan ke dauraan maathe par tripund or tikaa lagaataar nazar aata rahaa
 In the evening, the Congress continued to promote social media and media in the photos and videos of Rahul's Durga Maa Arti and Garbe
 is mudde par ajtak se baatcheet main arpyen ne kaha ki, navaratri ke dauraan agar rahul devi maa kii puja karte hai, gujarat ke prasiddh dwarkadhish mandir jate hai, to kya hua, ham sab jate hai
 But the Congress has no direct answer as to why it did not go to any mosque
 kul milakar congress ko lagata he ki, bihar uske haq main vot to karenge, lekin bihar kii tarj par muslim agar shanti se, bina shor sharabe or bina uksaave main aaye saath de
 Also, if Congress breaks even a section of Hindus from BJP then it can achieve success
 isiilie congress or team rahul rajya main soft hindutv kii taraf badhate nazar aa rahe hai

 Khap has denied the shameful decree of going to Panchayat in Sakrand village in Baghpat, West UP and raping two daughters of a Dalit family
 panchayat kaa kahana he ki usne aisa koi faisla nahin sunaaya he
 Meanwhile, this matter is also taking political color
 supreme court ke hastkshep ke baad gaanv main piesi tainaat he
 But the tension can be clearly seen on the face of the villagers
 peediton ke mutabik, panchayat ne unki do betiyon ke saath rape or sabake saamne nirvastr karne kaa farmaan sunaaya he
 Both girls left home after this fear

 When people of the girl's community got the idea, she was married

 The girl arrived from her in-laws in March
 vah april, 2015 main dalit ladke ke saath faraar ho gai
 a few days later both were recovered from Mehrauli in Delhi

 Calling the Supreme Court, a CBI inquiry was demanded by the police in Meerut on the night of 27-28 May 2015
 ladki waalon ke dabaav main ladke ko narkotics act main jail bhej diya gaya
 Then came the decree of the Khap Panchayat on 30 July 2015
 dalit ladke se badla lene ke liye uski donon bahanon se rape kaa faisla sunaaya gaya
 Both girls from the Dalit family have approached the Supreme Court to be given justice
 sibiai jaanch kii jaae
 Now the panchayat refused the order, two sisters hiding in Delhi for fear of Khap Panchayat in Baghpat say that they will return only after being given full security
 isi bich kai dinon baad ladki ke mata-pita police suraksha ke bich ghar laut aae hai
 Police is stationed in the village
 isi bich kaha ja rahaa he ki ladki ko bhagane vaale ladke kii bahanon se rape kaa farmaan sunaaya hi nahin gaya

 Intelligence agencies have decoded the Talent Hunt of Operation Terror of the Pakistani agency ISI to spread terror in Jammu and Kashmir
 jisase pataa chalaa he ki paak agency ne aatanki hafiz said ke saath milakar nae thikaanon par training camp khole hai
 Documents from the intelligence agency present near Aaj Tak have revealed that Akhafiz Saeed of Atank is opening training camps in new places for recruitment of terrorists under ISI patronage
 ye camp iesai or hafiz ne milakar POK ke boi, madarpur, fagosh or devliyaan main khole hai

 According to the intelligence report, lashkar-e-tayyiba has divided the recruited terrorists into operations in Jammu and Kashmir for the first time in 4 zones

 For this, training is being given under the supervision of the Pakistan Army and ISI in pok's forward Kahuta, Dudhaniyal, Kel and Nikail

 com / y74jknfcty gurmeet ram rahim singh kii raajadaar haniprit kii giraftaar ko ek maheenaa hone vaala he
 But till now the hands of the police are looking empty
 naa koi thos saboot or naa hi koi bada kaboolnamaa
 In front of every trick of Honeypreet, the police is eating out
 haniprit se abhi tak police ko kuch khaas suraag nahin mila he
 No big evidence was found and no big confession
 uske mobile se lekar laptop tak kaa data gaayab he
 It seems that Hahnipreet has managed to mislead Insapolis
 yahaan tak ki jail main use viipi suvidhaayen die jane kii khabaren aa rahi hai
 His family goes to jail to meet him comfortably
 aisa lagane laga he ki haryana kii police bhi haniprit par meharbaan he
 Whether there is money in the camp or the work inside the camp, questions have been raised about the role of Honeypreet everywhere
 aise kai iljaam he jin se police ko pardaa uthaanaa he or saboot ikattha karne hai
 But Honeypreet's silence is coming every time
 uski giraftaar ke 26 din biit jane par bhi police ke haath khaali hai
 The police of 7 states lost the sweat to catch the honeypreet
 jo haniprit 38 dinon tak police ko chakam detii rahi
 Raising Raj from that honeypreet is also a far cry from the police
 police ne saare hatkande apana liye hai
 From raids to witnesses
 faraari ke vakt haniprit kahaan rahi, kaise rahi, kiski madad se rahi, sari padtaal kii gai
 But the police still has not felt anything big
 chaahe wo panchkula hinsa main haniprit kaa role ho yaa dere ke andar ke raaj
 Honeypreet is constantly misleading the police
 police adaalat se uski remand badhaane main to kaamyaab ho rahi he lekin shaatir haniprit se kuch bhi ugalvaane main naakaam dikh he
 Honeypreet was arrested by the police on 3 October
 ambala jail se bhi haniprit ko lekar kai khabaren aa rahi hai
 There has been a ruckus about the facilities that Honeypreet is getting in jail
 8 dinon main haniprit ke parivaar ke log use milane do baar jail ja chuke hai
 At the same time, reports of the family going inside the jail along with the car have also put a question mark on the police
 bina roak tok parivaar kii gaadi sidhaa jail ke andar chali jaati he
 However, when the matter was discussed with the jail staff, they overcame the situation
 jail membaaki kaidiyon ke parijanon ne haniprit ko viipi treetment die jane kaa khulaasa kiya he
 Who has questioned the facilities that Honeypreet is getting

 The page was not empty, but it was printed in such a way that the written news was given a vessel with ink
 pehle panne par hi kone main ek laal rang kaa stamp laga he jis par sikret likhaa he or kinare par likhaa he note for release
 This was a decision by the newspapers to tell the public at once, how the government is enacting laws to keep it away from information
 2007 main The Right To Know coalition bana tha lekin uske itihaas main pehali baar vyapak str par aisa abhiyaan chalaa he

 The newspapers have written that do not be misled by the claims of the leaders that the media is running this campaign in their own interest, this is not true
 yah abhiyaan aap pathakon or darshakon ke jaanane ke adhikaar ke bare main he
 This campaign is stating that when journalists ask for information under Right to Information, it is delayed
 vahaan ke kanoon kaa naam he freedom of information act
 There is so much delay in giving information that the election gets out, the public does not know and then that information is no longer important

 Read the statement of Associate Professor sharif-as-sabir, who teaches international business there
 'there are some area, some classified ares, where they should not have access, they should not have let people know, national security, defense, international relations, law enforcement, public saftey, these are the areas the govt is saying should not be accessed by anyone including journalist, interstingly when we talk about freedome of information act, then the cabinet documents are also exempts from freedom of informations, so there is what is happening, many of those documents are leaked out, there are some whistle blowers and these are affecting the media and the same time affceting the govt but the people in australia in genral more than 87 of the people think that they have the right to know what is happening, and now only 37 percent think that it is happening
 there is a problem here, there is a real issue here, that needs to be sorted out, when we talk abt public ofcourse, in terms of freedom of info act, if we look at that particular act closely, these exceptions are not allowing people or the public to know a lot of things they want to know / but at the same time we do realize the govt may be concerned because it could be something that the govt would want to control
 and that control is creating a issue now, media is suggesting that govt is dealing with those issues, in a heavy handed manner, so regardles of govt and media positions, i think public in gen in austraila they are becoming concerned what is happenig and why is this hide and seek game happening in austraila, whether people are safe, or they are facing some trouble or they are expecting something ominous in the future, peole are worried because they dont know what is the real agenda of the govt and what sort of information restrictions they want to actually put on the media, and why they are scared and afred of letting the people know
 Michael Miller, executive chairman of News Corp Australia, also wrote in his editorial about the campaign that the New York Times has rightly said that Australia is the most mysterious democracy in the world
 matlab kya ho rahaa he kisi ko pataa nahin he
 In this article, a famous Australian constitutional affairs lawyer, Jarya Williams, also said that information is being stopped in Australia by creating anti-terror and national security laws

 Chyawanprash is rich in antioxidants and regenerative herbs
 yah rasayan ke antargat vargeekrut utpaada he—kayakalp karne vaala or vriddhavastha virdohi
 Chyawanprash is helpful in delaying the aging of cells, improving nutritional levels of tissues, improving digestive power and improving oxygen supply to critical tissues

 But despite this, Chidambaram's problems did not ease, and in October last year, a note from the Finance Ministry came out, stating that Chidambaram could have stopped the allocation of 2-G spectrum licenses if he wanted
 iske baad sarkaar baikfoot par dikhne lagi, or vipaksh sansad ke andar or baahar hangaamaa karata rahaa
 The CBI too has its own arguments regarding Chidambaram's role in the case, and the investigating agency is using the statement of the then Finance Secretary d Subbarao, in which he said that the idea of 'first come first served' was not liked by P
 Chidambaram , But the then Telecom Minister a Raja adjourned the meeting
 iske alaava e raja ke khilaaf likhaa gaya chidambaram kaa khat bhi sibiai ke paas he
 The comments jabaki janata party netaa subramanyam swami puure maamle main grahamantri pi chidambaram ko sah-aaropee banaakar sibiai se jaanch karwaanaa chaahate hai
 They allege that the investigating agencies under the Home Ministry are protecting Chidambaram
 swami chaahate hai ki varsh 2008 main jab pi chidambaram vittamantri the, us dauraan unki bhoomika kii jaanch karwaai jaae, kyonki usee dauraan 2-ji spectrum ke liye daam tay kiye gaye the
 The entry fee for the spectrum license was kept for the year 2001, while the number of people using mobiles had increased almost hundred times during this period
 swami kaa aarope he ki chidambaram ne spectrum kii nilaamee par jor nahin diya or entry fees badhaane kii bhi maang nahin kii, varanaa sarkaar ko ghaataa na hota
 Chidambaram also did not stop the alleged mastermind of the scam, a Raja, and gave Swan and Unitech the green signal to sell its share to Etisalat and Uninor, who sold it for much more than they had paid for the license
 is baat ko chipaaya gaya ki etisalaat or uninor bharat main kaali suchi main hai
 The companies to be licensed include Unitech Wireless, s-tel, Sistema Shyam, Swan Telecom, Datacom Services, Loop Telecom, Tata Teleservices, Spice Communications and Idea Cellular

 Information about the police interrogation of JNU Students Union President Kanhaiya Kumar who was arrested for raising anti-national slogans has come to light
 'aaj tak' ko mili exclusive report ke mutabik, kanhaiya ne poochtacha ke dauraan yah sweekaar kiya he ki usne aresas or pradhanmantri narendra modi kii ninda kii thi, lekin desh virdohi naare lagane kii baat se inkaar kiya he
 Kanhaiya Kumar was arrested by the Delhi Police on 12 February on charges of sedition and criminal conspiracy
 vah philhal police castady main he auradilli pulicepoochtacha kar rahi he
 In the interrogation, he dismissed the allegations of raising anti-national slogans at a function organized in support of terrorist Afzal Guru at the JNU campus on 9 February
 kanhaiya ne police ko dsu ke un sadasyon ke naam bhi bataae hai jo kaarykram ke aayojak the
 Kanhaiya told these things to Delhi Police JNUSU adhyaksh hone ke naate mujhe 8 farvari ko jaankaree mili ki 9 ko dsu ek cultural event yojit kar rahaa he
 2
 kaarykram se ek din pehle mujhe kuch nahin pataa tha ki unka agenda kya he
 3
 8 farvari ko meri tabiyat kharaab tha or 9 farvari ko bhi zyaadaatar vakt main soya rahaa
 4
 9 farvari kii shaam ko main tab uthaa jab AISF ke sadsy mere paas aae or bataaya ki jeenyu prashasan ne cultural event ke liye di gai anumati radd kar di he
 5

 Night-out along the Matla River is the highlight of this holiday

 This diverts their attention from the shattering effects of old age, pain and discomfort, sight and hearing difficulties, even forgetfulness and depression, which is good for them
 hindustan kaa janasankhyikeey napha-nuksaan or badhati yuva aabaadi kii tamaam baaten apni jagah, par desh teji se budhaape kii taraf bhi bad rahaa he
 According to the 2016 report of the Union Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation, 10 in the country
 39 karod bujurg yani 60 baras kii umr se zyada ke log hai
 These are about 8 of the country's population
 5 fisadi hai
 This figure has been extracted from the 2011 census
 bujurgon kii aabaadi har saal 3
 It has grown at a rate of 5 per cent, which is double the rate of growth of the total population
 enjio helpage india kii 2014 kii ek report bataati he ki hindustan jahaan 2020 tak duniya kaa sabase yuva desh hoga, vahiin 2050 tak 32
 50 crore, i

 20 percent of the population, people will be "elderly"
 report yah bhi kahati he ki 2006 se 2050 ke bich jahaan bharat kii kul aabaadi 40 fisadi badhegi, vahiin bujrgon kii aabaadi main 270 fisadi tak ijapha hoga
 What economic and social policies are being made in view of this huge increase in the population of the elderly in India? President of All India Senior Citizens Confederation (AISCCON)
 pi
 Kinjwadekar says, "the potential age of people above 70 has increased by 18 per cent, but this does not necessarily improve their lives
" ''sankhyikee mantralay kii report bataati he ki budhaape main nirbharta kaa anupaat 1961 main 10
 14 in 2011, up 9 percent
 2 fisadi ho gaya
 By this ratio, the pressure exerted on the economically productive population is measured
 haalanki 41
 6% of the elderly population still works (there is a big difference between rural and urban, male and female populations), but fewer people feel financially secure
 kaam karne vaale bujrgon kii badi sankhya gramin aadamiyon kii he (60 se upar ke 66
 4 per cent of rural men work, compared to just 11 in urban men
 3 fisadi he)
 For them, the facility of formal pension is also limited and largely inadequate
 2016 main 15,000 gramin or shahari logon ke bich kiye gaye edwel foundation ke ek survey main 65 fisadi uttardaataaon ne kaha ki ve rupye-paise ke liye yaa to dusron ke mohataaj hai yaa aarthik sankat se ghire hai
 At the same time, about 80 percent of the people facing financial problems said that the crisis is due to the cost of treatment and medicines
 udhar, eiescisioin kaa 2015-16 kaa survey bataata he ki pariwaron ke saath rah rahe 60 fisadi bujurgon ko gaali-galouj or durvyavhaar kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, 66 fisadi bujurg yaa to "behad garib'' yaa garibi kii rekha ke neeche hai or 39 fisadi ko yaa to chhod diya gaya he yaa ve akele rah rahe hai

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that 2 of GDP spent on health care by 2025

 In the recent budget, the government announced the Ayushman Bharat National Health Program, in which every year Rs 5 lakh per family
 tak kaa swasthya kawarej dene kaa vaada kiya gaya he
 This shows that the government considers the need to increase spending on public health
 pichhali ek yojana ke tahat bujurg hindustaniyon ko 1 lakh ru
 The insurance was given in which people above the poverty line had to pay their own premium
 is yojana ko bhi ab ayushmaan bharat main mila diya gaya he
 Some 10 crore families will be included in the new scheme, which the government is telling the most worldwide
 zyada rakam kaa beshak swaagat he
 a report by the National Sample Survey Organization reported that urban hospitalizations in 2014 cost an average of 176 per cent more than in 2004, while rural patients were paying 160 per cent more than a decade earlier
 eneses ke aankadon se yah bhi pataa chalaa ki keval bujurgon se milakar bana parivaar swasthya dekhbhaal par har maheene 3
 Spends 8 times more than a family that has no elderly
 phir tajjub kya ki itane saare hindustani bujurg rupye-paise ke liye apane pariwaron ke aasare hai

 # babumoshaibandookbaaz # collage a post shared by Bidita Bandookbaaz (@biditabag) on Jul 11, 2017 at 4:35am PDT Sometimes clashes between Dalits and Muslims, sometimes clashes between Dalits and Thakurs, after all why is violence happening again and again in Saharanpur? bees teen main teesri baar hinsa ke shikaar saharanpur main shanti qaayam karne ke liye prashasan ne sabhi pakshon ke saath baithak kii
 Along with Dalits and Thakurs, many political parties also participated
 police kii taraf se pehle jo nakaaraapan dikhaaya gaya, ab prashasan uski bharpai kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Saharanpur DM NP Singh says that the intelligence and police's assessment was that there will be minor resistance if we stop this mahapanchayat and return people from outside, but any organized attack on police hoga aisi koi ashanka nahin thi
 If Saharanpur is burning, then there is a failure of the police behind it, politics is also deep
 nikaay chunaav ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ye puraa maamla dalit votbank ko apane saath jodne or daliton or agadon ke bich kaai paidaa kar raajnneetik roti senkane kaa bhi he
 On 20 April, in the road Dudhli, an attempt was made to create a gap between Dalits and Muslims on the pretext of Ambedkar procession
 maqasad hindu card khilne kaa tha, taaki daliton ko bijepi ke saath majbooti se joda ja sake
 However, BJP MP Raghav Lakhanpal, who was part of that procession, does not consider it right
 saharanpur ke bijepi saansad raghav lakhanpal kehete hai ki aisi ghatnaayen kyon ho jaati hai or kyon ho rahi hai
 
 
 This is the subject of an investigation, which will be seen, but these incidents are not interlinked
 pichhali do ghatnaayen jarur judi hui hai
 Now we have to see who is the naughty element in it
 5 may ko shabbirpur gaanv main daliton ne pehle jis tarah se thakuron ke kilaaf uksaave kii karrwai kii, uske peeche sthaneey bispi pradhan kaa haath bataaya jaataa he
 The police could not understand the seriousness, so she could not stop the arson incident from the Thakurs
 nau may kii hinsa daliton kii taraf se badale kii karrwai he
 People came from outside to provoke them
 isamen bhim sena kaa haath bataaya ja rahaa he
 The aim is to strengthen the bsp's vote bank by widening the gap between Dalits and Thakurs
 haalanki bispi bhim sena ke saath sambandh se inkaar kar rahi he
 The comments bispi netaa qaazi rashid masood kaa kahana he ki yah jhagada bispi dwaara karaayaa gaya he, yah baat bilkul galat he
 They allege that the Bhima Army men did it and this organization has nothing to do with the BSP
 saharanpur main 10 saal se nikaay chunaav nahin hue hai
 Now they are going to be soon
 isse pehle bispi un daliton ko apane saath waapas jodna chaahati he jo vidhansabha chunaav main usase chhitakkar bijepi ke paas chale gaye
 Whereas BJP is trying to keep Dalits attached to them at any cost
 is rassakashi ke bich saharanpur main or hinsa kii ashanka barqaraar he
 For the third time in twenty three, the administration held a meeting with all the parties to establish peace in Saharanpur, a victim of violence
 isamen dalit or thakuron ke saath-saath tamaam raajnneetik dalon ne bhi hissaa liya
 The denial shown before the police, now the administration is trying to make up for it
 saharanpur ke dm enpi singh kaa kahana he ki intelligence or police kaa aankalan yah tha ki is mahapanchayat ko roak denge or baahar se hi logon ko waapas kar denge to chote-mote pratirodh honge, lekin police par sangathit rup se koi hamalaa There was no such possibility
 saharanpur jal rahaa he to iske peeche police kii naakaami to he hi, raajnneeti bhi gahari he
 Keeping in view the civic elections, this whole issue is also about joining the Dalit vote bank and creating political bread between Dalits and Forwards
 20 april ko sadak dudhli main ambedkar juluus ke bahaane daliton or musalmaan ke bich ek khai paidaa karne kii koshish kii gai
 The aim was to play the Hindu card, so that the Dalits could be strongly linked with the BJP
 haalanki us juluus ke hissaa rahe bijepi saansad raghav lakhanpal ise sahi nahin maanate
 BJP MP from Saharanpur Raghav Lakhanpal says why such incidents happen and why they are happening
 
 
 yah ek jaanch kaa vishay he, jise dekha jayega, lekin yah ghatnaayen aapas main judi hui nahin hai
 The last two incidents are definitely linked
 ab isamen shararti tatv koun he, yah hamen dekhnaa hoga
 On May 5, the way the Dalits first tried to provoke action against the Thakurs in Shabbirpur village, the hand of the local BSP chief is said to be behind it
 police gambhirtha ko nahin samaj pai, lihaaza thakuron kii taraf se aagzani kii vaardaat ko vah roak nahin pai
 The violence of May 9 is a revenge action on the part of Dalits
 unhen uksaane ke liye baahar se log aae
 Bhima Army's hand is being told in this
 maqasad dalit or thakuron ke bich khai badhaakar bispi ke votbank ko majboot karne kii koshish he
 The BSP, however, denies the association with Bhima Army
 tippaniyan BSP leader Qazi Rashid Masood says that this quarrel has been made by BSP, this is totally wrong
 unka aarope he ki bhim sena ke logon ne ise anjaam diya tha or is sanghathan kaa bispi se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Saharanpur has not had a body election for 10 years
 ab ve jald hone vaale hai
 Before this, the BSP wants to bring back the Dalits who have gone to the BJP in the assembly elections
 jabaki bijepi kisi bhi qeemat par daliton ko apane se jode rakhane kii koshish main he
 Amid this tussle, there is a possibility of further violence in Saharanpur

 Salim Khan also said that it would be better to express his displeasure first by writing a letter to the government before returning the award

 jaankaron ke mutabik, yah shaayad trump ko pasand nahin aae jo pehle hi china ke prabhaav ko lekar apni chintaa jaahir kar chuke hai
 China is most concerned by trump-kim's meeting, which is why, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said that Donald Trump wants to take some big and bold decisions in talks with North Korean chief Kim Jong
 unhone kaha- 'trump north korea ko suraksha aashwaasan dene or garmjoshi ke saath raajnneetik rishta banane ko taiyaar hai

 But with the changing times, the number of coffee lovers has also increased
 yahi vajah he ki desh main cafe or lounj kaa culture teji se badha he
 Open in 2000, Barista claims to bring this international experience to India first
 barist ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari punit gulati kehete hai, "san 2000 tak desh main coffee cafe jaisaa koi culture nahin tha
 It was limited only to the menus of large hotels and restaurants
 desh main bade badlaav ho rahe the, badi bahurashtriya companiyaan bharat ke bazaar main maukey talash rahi thim
 Then the barista first opened the first coffee cafe in Basant Lok, Delhi
 ''bade shaharon main logon kii kharch karne kii aadaton main ho rahe parivartan kaa barist ko bada phayda mila or thode hi samay main yah charchit ho gaya
 Such culture was especially emphasized among the youth
 beete 18 varshon main barist kaa prabandhan bhale hi do baar badla ho lekin apni quality or culture kii vajah se isane logon ke dilon main khaas jagah bana lee
 Apart from barista, many domestic and foreign coffee chains have set foot in the country
 barist kii coffee ke daam anya kii tulana main zyada bhi hai
 But the company believes that the reason is quality
 gulati kehete hai, "barist apni coffee main 100 fisadi arabian coffee kaa istemaal karata he
 In this case, the cost of coffee is higher than others
 ''laagat zyada hone ke kaaran coffee kaa mulya bhi anya coffee brand kii tulana main zyada hota he
 Gulati also says, "nobody does the way the barista blends coffee
 '' yahi kaaran he ki barist kii coffee kaa apana alag swaad he or log anya brand kii tulana main ise zyada pasand karte hai
 Regular customers in the barista love the coffee as well as the ambiance
 puure desh main is samay barist ke 200 outlet hai
 Of these, 130 outlets belong to the company, the rest being franchised
 bharat ke alaava company ke store srilanka, maldive, myanmar or nepal main bhi hai
 New Management, New Strategy In 2014 the management of Barista came to the hands of Rolatrainers
 tab tak desh main kai or coffee chen bhi apni pakad bana chuki thim
 The challenge of the new management amidst competition was to strengthen its position in the market and reach more people
 aise main prabandhan ne kai bade badlaav kiye or ise barist 2
 Named 0
 gulati bataate hai, "is disha main kaam karte hue nae prabandhan ne nae product kii lonching, franchiji model shuru karne, luk or feel badalane jaisi kai pahal kin
 "after 2014, Barista moved from metro cities to Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities and from lounges to coffee cafes, corporate offices
" iske liye company ne do khaas model sthapit kiye
 First, Barista Kiosk and second Barista Express
 inamen lounj kii tarah badi jagah kii aavashyaktaa nahin thi
 Just 5 m 7 is enough space for Barista Express
 isi main freezer, heater, water supplai disple, billing counter aadi kii vyavastha kii gai he
 Due to the need of less space, Barista's Express counters were able to quickly make places like hospitals, corporate offices, malls
 barist kiyosk ke liye express store kii tulana main thodi zyada jagah kii jarurat hoti he, lekin lounj kii tulana main ye kaaphi chote hote hai
 Gulati explains that the franchise model of the company was very successful through these two models
 ek oner ek se zyada express or kiyosk kii franchiji lene lage or barist ne teji se puure desh main apni jagah banaai
 In the next four months, the company will open 40 to 50 new stores, 80 percent of which will be based on the franchise model
 company kaa daawa he ki is vistaar ke baad vah puure desh main sabase zyada uplabdhta vaali coffee chen ban jaaegi
 The story ahead of coffee: When Barista moved from big cities like Delhi, Mumbai to cities like Patna, Lucknow and Indore, the company also launched new products, realizing the need of customers
 barist keval coffee ke liye hi nahin balki khaas drink quinchars ke liye bhi janaa jane laga
 It was launched in 32 flavors
 garmiyon main chaay or coffee se duuri banane vaale logon ke liye quinchars behatar vikalp sabit hua
 The company started a special initiative to make this new beverage available among the people
 company ne bataaya ki quinchars kii bottle ko ghar le jaakar aap kis tarah se istemaal kar sakate hai
 If a customer has an idea other than this, he can share it
 idia pasand aane par company ne us graahak ko ek saal kii free coffee kii peshkash kii
 The company's focus is now on reaching home to customers
 isi lakshya ke saath company haal hi main fast mowing kanjumar guds (emmemasiji) sector main utar chuki he
 Among them, house blend coffee powder, cookies, ginger honey, coffee mug, chocolates of various varieties are prominent
 ye product abhi barist ke stores par uplabdh hai
