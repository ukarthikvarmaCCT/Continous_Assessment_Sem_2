 According to Jain, the distance of the joint between the flyovers increases in winter and shrinks in summer

 Talking to Aaj Tak, Satyendra Jain said, 'in Delhi, flyovers are added to the expansion

 The crack is so large that the wheel of any two-wheeler can easily get stuck in it
 isse pehle bhi ring road par bane hayaat hotel fliover par bhi aisi hi ek daraar aa chuki he
 In such a situation, the big question is whether there is negligence in the maintenance of flyovers in Delhi

 aapako yaad hoga kuch vakt pehle rajkot se serial killer kii aisi vaardaat saamne ai thi jo pattharon se sir kuchal kar logon ko maar detaa he
 By now he had killed three people in the city
 iske baad jab shahar main dehshat faili or police harakat main ai to anaachak wo gaayab ho gaya
 After a few days of silence, now suddenly he has knocked for the fourth time in the city
 iske saath hi shahar ke saamne chauthi laash thi
 Bloody knock for the fourth time
 Now he has given a bloody knock for the fourth time in Rajkot
 is baar pathar se kuchal kar ek bujurg kaa katl kiya he
 The mysterious Stoneman is out of police custody
 haalat ye he ki ab gujarat ke rajkot main log stoneman kaa naam sunate hi kaanp uthte hai
 Nobody wants to stay out of the house till late at night
 bas stand par mili lashrajkot main buudhvaar subah bas stand par ek laavaaris laash padi hone kii khabar mili
 As soon as the news was received, the opportunity of the police reached the incident, but after seeing the condition of the corpse and the method of killing, the ground slipped under the feet of the policemen
 shaks kaa katl baari pathar se kuchal kar kiya gaya tha
 Which is lying near the corpse
 jald hi ye saaf hua ki marane vaala rajkot ke hi mavadi ilaake kaa rahane vaala dhiraj bhai vithlani naam kaa ek aisa shaks tha, jo akasar kaam kii talash main is bas stand par aayaa karata tha
 But he had no enmity with anyone
 aise main sabase bada sawaal yahi tha ki aakhir beeti raat stoneman ne dhiraj bhai ko apana nishaanaa kyon banaaya? bas stand jaisi khuli jagah par ek shaks kaa katl hote hue kisi ne kyon nahin dekha?ab stoneman ke is chauthe or taaje katl ne ek baar phir police ke saamne nai chunauti khadi kar di he
 Roughly this time, Stoneman's method of executing the murders is also similar to earlier cases
 is barstonman ne katlko anjaam dene ke baad makatool yani dhiraj bhai ke gharavaalon ko usee ke mobile phone se kol nahin kiya he
 Whereas in the first three murders he has been doing so
 stoneman ne 20 april ko di thi pehali dastakgujarat kerajkot main stonemanyani pattharon vaale serial killer ne 20 april ko apni pehali dastak di thi
 When a man named Sagar Mewada was crushed to death in the Bhaktinagar area of the city
 is laash kaa sir naa sirf buree tarah kuchlaa hua tha, balki paas hi khun se sanaa ek baari pathar par tha, jisase us par hamalaa kiya gaya
 But before the police could investigate this murder, the police got a shocking thing
 wo ye ki kaatil ne shaks kaa katl karne ke baad usee kaa mobile phone lekar uske gharavaalon ko phone kiya or kaha tha ki 'maine isko tapakaa diya he, jo kar sakate ho, kar lo!'25 april ko hui duusari vaardaatiske thik paanch din baad 25 april ko thik aisi hi ek duusari vaardaat saamne ai
 This time, the body of a person named Pravin Bhai was found from Gandhigram area of the city
 is baar bhi laash kaa sir baari pathar se kuchlaa hua tha
 But as the investigation progressed, the police were shocked when they came to know that the murderer had done the same thing that he had done the last time after committing the crime this time too
 ab police ko ye lagane laga he ki ho naa ho in donon hi vaardaaton ke peeche kisi ek hi shaks yaa gang kaa haath he
 Which is not only taking the lives of people by crushing them with stones, but is also threatening and challenging them in the same way by calling the families of the deceased
 police ko mila sisitivi footejaisi bich thik 38 din baadastonminane teesri baar shahar main apni maujuudagi kaa ehsaas karaayaa
 This time he targeted a fourth man named Vallabh Bhai Rangani
 isaki laash shahar ke padgaanv ilaake main padi mili
 As the investigation progressed, a CCTV footage of the suspected stoneman was found in the hands of the police, in which he was seen walking alongside Rangani
 police ne rakhaa 2 lakh rupee kaa inaamaitna sabakuch hone ke baad bhi wo police ke haath nahin aata
 According to police witnesses, he also got his sketch prepared and announced a reward of Rs 2 lakh in his name
 lekin isse pehle ki pulicestonemanake raaj se pardaa hataati usne katl kii chauthi vaardaat ko anjaam de diya he
 This knock of Stoneman reminded Rajkot of a seven-year-old serial killer who crushed the stones and killed innocent people on the same lines
 tab do rahasyamayi kaatilon ke police ke shikanje main aane ke baad katl kaa silsilaa ruuk gaya tha lekin ye nayaa silsilaa kab or kaise rukegaa, ye koi nahin jaanata
 In two cities, Stoneman took the lives of more than 25 people
 Talking about Mumbai and Kolkata, Stoneman has killed more than 25 people in these two cities
 hairaani ye he ki in shaharon main kabhi stoneman kaa asli cheharaa saamne hi nahin aayaa
 Due to the fear of an anonymous stoneman, that is, a stone murderer may be presently in Rajkot, Gujarat these days, but the presence of such murderers and their antics in the country and abroad is not new
 akele hindustan main hi mumbai, kolkata, assam or shiridy jaise shaharon main alag-alag vakt main stoneman kii shakl main kaatilon ne anginat begunaahon ko mahaj pathar maar kar maut kii neend sulaayaa he
 Police arrested 5 people, including mastermind and housemaid Kishan, in the murder case of 92-year-old Krishna Dev Khosla, who lives in a posh colony, Greater Kailash, in Delhi's posh colony, revealed in the murder case of elderly Krishna Dev Khosla

 The corpse was buried in a pit about 6 feet
 aaropee naukar ne poochtacha main kai bade khulaase kiye hai
 Krishna was angry with Khosla's behavior
 The accused servant Kishan told in the inquiry that Krishna Khosla used to scold him for delay in giving him dinner if he did not have good tea
 kishan ne khulaasa kiya ki is vajah se uske andar kaaphi gussa bhar gaya tha
 So he started plotting to kill Krishna Khosla
 hatya ke kuch din pehle usne sangam vihaar ke tigadi main kiraye par cameraa liya or 29 agast se us kamare main gaddha khudaai kaa kaam shuru karvaa diya
 After this, on Saturday, the servant mixed the intoxicating substance in the tea and rendered the elderly couple unconscious
 phir chunni se krishna khosla kaa galaa ghonta or maar daalaa
 He then looted the house along with his comrades
 police ne jab poocha ki mahila ko kyon chhod diya to naukar ne kaha wo kabhi mujhe daantati nahin thi
 His behavior was fine, so gave up
 is hatyakand main ek aaropee kii police ko or talash he jo philhal faraar he
 In the investigation of the criminal history of the accused servant, it is revealed that the servant Kishan has an old criminal history
 south dilli ke hi hauj khaas thane main us par chen sneching or chori ke 2 maamle main darj hai
 Not only this, his brother is also facing a case of murder
 police ke mutabik, khosla parivaar ne apane naukar kishan kaa police veriphication nahin karavaaya tha
 If the Khosla family had done so, perhaps the truth of Kishan would have been known beforehand and this incident could have been avoided
 police ke mutabik, naukar kishan ko is hatyakand ke baad jaraa bhi afsos nahin he
 After killing the elder, he was buried in the pit before being taken straight to the fridge
 police ne hatyakand ko sulajhane ke liye 200 sisitivi khangale, lekin hatya ke baad aakhir aaropee ghar se frij main band karke bujurg ko kyon le gaye, mauka-e-vaardaat par kyon nahin choda
 After all, why has the servant done such a big risk that it is being investigated

 (from input language) (input bhashaa se) There is now only a little time left for the World Cup to begin
 cricket ke is mahakumbh ke liye bhartiya chayankartaaon or team prabandhan ne ballebaaji line-ap main sabase mahatvapurn chauthe sthaan ke liye daavedaar maane ja rahe ambati raidu ko nahin chunaa
 KL Rahul, Dinesh Karthik and Vijay Shankar are the players who can play at this number in the team selected by the Indian selectors
 is teenon main se keel rahul kaa chauthe sthaan ke liye daawa majboot najar aata he
 KL Rahul has returned to form and 64 in the current IPL season
 50 kii behtareen ausat se ab tak 387 ran bana chuke hai
 Rahul is second in the list of batsmen scoring the most runs this season
 rahul IPL 12 main ek shatak or 4 ardhashatak jad chuke hai
 Did IPL get Rahul a World Cup ticket? The biggest question is whether KL Rahul is preferred over Ambati Rayudu based on the current IPL performance
 kyonki isse pehle rahul international cricket ke teenon formet main kharaab form se jujh rahe the
 Let me tell you that in the last four years, the 11 batsmen who were tried by the Indian team management for the fourth place did not meet the expectations
 bharat ne world cap 2015 ke baad jin ballebaajon ko chauthe number par aajamaaya he unamem se sarvaadhik 14 match ambati raidu ne khele hai
 Prior to the series against Australia, Rayudu looked set at number four, but was able to score only 33 runs in the first three matches and the team management managed the last two matches before the World Cup starting in Britain from 30 May (australia Against him in the fourth and fifth ODI), had decided to try another player at this number
 IPL-12 se thik pehle australia ke khilaaf chauthe vanade main keel rahul ko number teen par mauka dene ke kaaran kohli chauthe number par utre
 This was the third time in the last four years when Kohli came out to bat at number four and managed only 30 runs in these three matches
 spasht he ki bhartiya captain ko simit overon main chauthaa number raas nahin aata or unhen tisare number par hi ballebaaji karnaa bhaataa he
 KL Rahul (26 runs in four matches) and Kedar Jadhav (18 runs in four matches) disappointed the most at number four
 hardik pandya ko paanch maichon main chauthe number par utaara gaya, lekin vah bhi ek pari (78 ran banaam australia, indore 2017) ko chhodkar kuch kamaal nahin kar paae
 In such a situation, it will be interesting to see who holds the fourth position in the World Cup 2019, a headache for the Indian batting line-up
 keel rahul, dhoni, dinesh karthik, vijay shankar yaa koi or
 Vijay Shankar in-rayudu Out: May Team India's No-4 Beats the No
 4 Bad Performance Against Australia, Rayudu had to perform well at number four before the domestic ODI series against Australia
 unhone 2015 vishwa cap ke baad is number par 14 maichon main 42
 He scored 464 runs at an average of 18
 raidu ke baad agar kisi anya ballebaaj ke liye yah sthaan adarsh mana ja rahaa tha, to vah purv captain mahendra singh dhoni the
 Dhoni went on to bat at number four in 12 matches in the last four years, in which he scored 40

 Remained 84
 ajinkya rahane bhale hi bhartiya vanade team kaa sadsy nahin hai, lekin ek samay vah bhi chauthe number par utarane ke daavedaar the
 Rahane played ten matches at this number after the World Cup 2015, including 46
 66 kii ausat se 420 ran banaae
 His strike rate is also 92
 71 rahaa
 Dinesh Karthik, Manish Pandey and Yuvraj Singh also came out to bat at number four in the last four years
 yuvaraj or pandey ne is number par ek ek shatak bhi jamaaya, lekin anya maichon main ve prabhavit nahin kar paae
 Karthik did not get a place in the team for the home ODI series against Australia as the second wicketkeeper, which created uncertainty about his place in the World Cup squad
 lekin, wicketcaping ke morche par rishabh pant kii kamajori karthik ke liye vardaan ban gai or unhen world cap kaa tikat mil gaya karthik ne pichley chaar varshon main chauthe number par nau maichon main 264 ran banaae hai
 Rayudu's boon form for Rahul In 2019, Ambati Rayudu scored 247 runs at an average of 35 so far, in which he has only one half-century
 world cap main number-4 ke daavedaar ke taur par is hyderaabadi ballebaaj ke aankade behad niraashajanak hai
 Rayudu's poor form raised expectations for KL Rahul in the middle order
 haalanki rahul ne keval 4 maukon par vanade main number 4 par ballebaaji kii he
 On the other hand, his success as the number 4 batsman in T20 International cannot be ignored

 In the 2013 assembly elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party won the government by winning 165 seats while the Congress had to settle for 58 seats
 vahiin bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ne 4 jabaki 3 siton par nirdaleey ummidavaaron ne jeet hasil kii thi
 According to the Election Commission, in 2013 Madhya Pradesh had a total of 46636788 voters including 22064402 female voters and 24571298 male voters and 1088 other voters
 2013 main 72

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has rejected Yashwant Sinha's demand to appear before the JPC in the 2G case
 pradhanmantri ne kaha he ki jepisi ke paas saare dastavej hai
 We have nothing to hide

 In a counter letter sent to Sinha, the Prime Minister said that whether the evidence should be produced and who should be asked to appear before the JPC, these decisions are matters which need to be decided internally by the JPC and its chairman is
 singh ne kaha ki 2008 main hue 2ji spectrum aavanton ke maamle main na to khud unke paas or na hi sarkaar ke paas chhipaane ke liye kuch he
 He told the BJP leader that he (sinha) is aware that all the proper records and documents are already available with the JPC

 Sinha, while advancing the demand made by former Telecom Minister a Raja to the JPC, said that the Prime Minister should appear before the committee

 Criticizing Sinha, Chacko said how can a JPC member write a letter to the Prime Minister? The committee has to decide in this regard
 sinha kaa patr keval raajnneetik stant he or yah sansadeey prakriya ke niyamon ke khilaaf he
 Congress leader Chacko said that Sinha's letter had no relevance as the committee decides, not a person, to call a minister or make any other decision

 The comments chaako ne kaha ki yadi samiti chaahe to bhi vah kisi mantri ko bataur gavaah tab tak nahin bula sakati, jab tak uske bare main sarvasammati se prastaav paarit na ho jaae
 The motion is sent to the Speaker of Lok Sabha for decision
 pradhanmantri ke pesh hone kii maang ko lekar dabaav banane ke liye jepisi main sinha or bijepi ke paanch anya sadasyon ne pichley saal kuch samay ke liye samiti kii kaarywahi kaa bahishkaar kiya tha
 Sinha had also expressed serious objection to not calling the JPC meeting for two months
 apni maang ko uchit tehraane ke liye sinha ne daleel di thi ki sansad kii lok lekha samiti (piesi) jab 2ji ghotaale kii jaanch kar rahi thi, to pradhanmantri ne uske samaksh pesh hone kii peshkash kii thi or unhen jepisi ke samaksh pesh hone se bhi hichkichana nahin chahie

 The by-elections were held because many jds-congress mlas revolted from their party and went to the bjp's court due to which the congress-jds coalition government had fallen in Karnataka and BJP under Yeddyurappa formed the government in the state
 did
 baad main in vidhayakon ko ayogy ghoshit kar diya
 When the matter reached the Supreme Court, the Speaker's decision to disqualify them was upheld but these rebel mlas were allowed to contest the by-elections
 15 siton par hue up-chunaav main bhaajapa 12 siton par jiti
 The Congress could win only 2 seats, while one candidate won
 karnataka vidhansabha main vidhayakon kii sankhya 224 he
 113 legislators are needed to form the government
 in 12 siton par jeet ke baad bhaajapa kii takat 105 se bad kar 117 ho gai he, jo bahumat se adhik he
 In this way the way for the stable government of BJP in Karnataka has been cleared
 ab vahaan sarkaar kii sthirataa ko lekar koi sankat nahin he
 But it is now difficult to say about the stability of Yeddyurappa as Chief Minister
 bhaajapa main 75 varsh kii samay seemaa paroksh rup se lagu he
 The BJP is not giving any important responsibility in the government or organization to people older than this
 yediurppa iske apwaad the
 Perhaps the main reason for this is that the BJP is not yet with a big leader of Yeddyurappa's stature in Karnataka
 rajya main bahumat paane ke liye bhaajapa kii yah majaburi thi ki vah yediurppa ke netritv ko sweekaar karen
 But now that the BJP has a majority, then Yeddyurappa may be necessary for the BJP but is no longer indispensable
 sutron kaa kahana he ki bhaajapa bahut jald hi unki jagah kisi duusare ko siem banane kii pahal nahin karegi lekin agle 6 maheene yaa saal bhar main yediurppa kii jagah kisi or ko siem pad kii jimmedaari di ja sakati he
 The age limit is not compatible with Yeddyurappa
 mana ja rahaa he ki unhe rajya main peedi parivartan ke liye raji kiya jayega or shaayad unhe rajyapal kii jimmedaari dekar sammaan sahit unki jagah kisi or ko siem banane kii pahal bhaajapa kar sakati he
 By the way, the matter has been discussed in the state since the time when Yeddyurappa became CM
 chunki yediurppa aise netaa hai jo saare faisle khud lete hai
 But the way the central leadership dominates him, he has felt uncomfortable with himself
 *** Following the revelations by wikileaks, Kashmir's separatist leaders have demanded influential world institutions to investigate alleged human rights abuses in the Valley
 hurriyat conference ke kattarpanthi dhade ke mukhiya saiyad ali shah gilaani ne ek bayaan main kaha, ‘ham emnesti international, di asia watch evam anya prabhaavshaalee sansthaaon se maang karte hai ki vah kashmir main ek team bhajekar yahaan ke jelon main yatnaaen die jane kii khabaron kii jaanch karaae
 Gilani also condemned the response of Chief Minister Omar Abdullah to the reports of human rights abuses in which he said "as far as this government is concerned, we do not ignore cases of torture"
 hamane na kabhi aisa kiya he or na kabhi karenge
 On the wikileaks revelations, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, the head of the moderate faction of the Hurriyat, said that torture is supported here as a state policy
 unhone bataaya, ‘ham hameshaa se kehete rahe hai ki kashmir main maanavadhikaron kii sthiti kaaphi kharaab he
 ' naksalwad kii jadon tak pahunchane kii aavashyaktaa par jor dete hue congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne kaha he ki desh main naksalwad kaa badhanaa is baat kaa parichaayak he ki hamaare dwaara kii gai vikaas kii pahal nichle tabakon or khaskar sabase pichde adivasee jilon tak thik tareeke se nahin pahunch paa rahi he
 In the latest issue of the Congress message, Sonia wrote in her letter to the Congressman, 'our country is facing a serious challenge like Naxalism
 chhattisgarh main haal main hue ek hamale main hamen siarpief ke 73 javaanon ko khona padaa
 We must deal with terrorist actions decisively, but it is necessary to get to the roots of Naxalism
 ’unhone kaha, ‘naksalwad kaa badhanaa is baat kaa parichaayak he ki hamaare dwaara kii gai vikaas kii pahal nichle tabakon tak thik tareeke se nahin pahunch paa rahi he, khaastaur se hamaare sabase pichde adivasee jilon tak
 Therefore, our government is implementing more targeted development schemes for the most backward districts
 ’dantewada main haal main naksali hamale main maare gayi siarpief javaanon ke parivaar ke prati samvednaa prakat karte hue sonia ne kaha ki chhattisgarh main haal main hue ek hamale main hamen siarpief ke 73 javaanon ko khona padaa
 We express our condolences to the family members who sacrificed their lives
 bihar main rajyasabha kii siton ke liye aaj chunaav hona he, haalanki isse pehle mushkil main fansi jediu ke liye argedy kii taraf se raahat bhari khabar ai
 RJD has announced support for JDU candidates in both the seats
 argedy ke adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav ne samarthan kaa elaan karte hue kaha ki vah bijepi ko haraane ke liye jediu ke ummidavaaron ke samarthan ke liye taiyaar hai
 Pawan Verma and Ghulam Rasool Baliyavi are JDU candidates in these elections although some rebel mlas have fielded two independents Anil Sharma and Sabir Ali, who have BJP support
 abhi 232 vidhayakon vaali bihar vidhansabha main jediu ke 117, bijepi ke 84, argedy ke 21, congress ke chaar, sipiai ke ek or paanch nirdaleey vidhayak hai
 Apart from this, 11 seats are vacant
 bihar main rajyasabha chunaav ke siyaasi drame kaa kya nateeja hoga yah to voton kii ginati ke baad hi pataa chalegaa
 Meanwhile, the politics of force-breaking is intensified here
 bihar ke saath hi arunachal pradesh main rajyasabha kii ek maatr seat ke liye aaj chunaav hoga, jisase do ummidavaar maidan main hai
 Votes will also be counted today
 pichley saal bhartiya tennis khilaadi sania mirza or switzaraland kii martina hingis kii jodi ne teen grand slam samet nau khitaab jitkar tennis kii duniya main tahalaka machaa diya tha
 The world of tennis was beginning to follow in the footsteps of the famous pair known as 'santina', and it seemed that both of them would be able to get the title and the title together, but it was announced on Monday that they were splitting due to poor results
 Huh

 After three Grand Slam victories and eleven WTA doubles titles together, we have mutually agreed that we would each be open to playing with other players for the remainder of the season
 Perhaps, because of our great past results, we have had very high expectations from our partnership and unfortunately did not get the results we desired recently
 We would like to clarify that it was a totally professional decision based purely on our recent results
 The professional decision has not and will not in any way affect the wonderful personal relationship that we continue to share
 We also look forward to defending our title in the year-end WTA Finals in Singapore in October for which Santina has already qualified
 We hope that this puts to rest some of the fabricated stories that have been doing the rounds in some sections of the media

 Three prominent BJP leaders returned the gifts
 From morning, it was discussed that the BJP mlas will return their gifts

 Modi said that he has returned the gifts after hearing the conscience
 unhone mukhyamantri ko chitthee likhakar maang kii he ki is tohfe dene kii pratha ko band kiya jaae

" aapane anya khelon main bhi dekha hoga ki ‘bi’ namoonay kaa pareekshan amuman vahi parinaam dikhaata he jo ‘e’ namoonay kaa rahata he

 ’ Sangwan, who hails from Najafgarh, played two matches in the last IPL against Royal Challengers Bangalore and Sunrisers Hyderabad
 vah ipel ke in donon maichon main ek bhi wicket nahin le paye the

 is kitaab main unhone purv CAG vinod raay or purv piem piem manmohan singh par apni tikhi raay rakhi he
 The king has particularly attacked Vinod Rai
 unhone kaha he ki vinod raay ko unke or upie-1 sarkaar ke khilaaf istemaal kiya gaya
 He has said that Vinod Rai remained in the same confusion till the end that he was protecting the conscience of the country, but he was being used
 vinod raay kii report he 'kooda'raja kaa kahana he ki vinod raay ne is maamle main dweshpurn karrwai kii, apni sanvaidhanik jimmedaari kaa galat istemaal kiya, atmprachaar kiya, desh ke vikaas ko roka
 Vinod Rai's report is just garbage, worth throwing in the trash
 unhone sanvaidhanik daayre se baahar jaakar kaam kiya
 Regarding the loss of 1 lakh 76 thousand crore rupees in the allocation of 2G spectrum in the fake figures of the media and the opposition, Raja says that this is a completely wrong figure
 upie shasankaal main mantri rahe raja ne kaha he ki vinod raay ne soochnaaon ko sansanikhej banaaya
 He tried to run his personal agenda by doing so
 unhone kai galtiyaan kin or paise kaa durupyog kiya
 According to Raja, the media and opposition were behind the sensationalization of the figure
 'vinod raay ke khilaaf ection ho'raja ne kaha he ki raay sanvaidhanik shaktiyon ke ulanghan ke doshi hai
 He must have had relations with any political party behind this
 unhone kaha ki raay par mukadmaa karnaa chahie, haalanki unako sanvaidhanik chhot mili he, lekin kam se kam se unke khilaaf ek jaanch cameti to baithaani hi chahie
 'vinod Rai should have an open debate with me' Raja has also said that he is ready for an open debate with Vinod Rai
 unhone kaha ki media se nivedan he ki donon kii bahes karaae
 Raja has said that the court did not accept Rai's loss of 1 lakh 76 thousand crore rupees
 yah puraa maamla upie-2 kii hatya ke liye raajnneeti se prerit tha, jisamen vinod raay ke kandhen par rakhkar bandook chalaai gai
 Questions raised on Manmohan's silence: Raja has also questioned the silence of former PM Manmohan Singh in this matter
 raja ne sawaal kiya ki manmohan ne us doorsanchaar niti kaa bachaav kyon nahin kiya, jise unhone khud manjuuri di thi
 Raja has said that Manmohan was misinformed by his advisors and the PMO was acting under pressure from the telecom lobby
 sibiai chhaapon se manmohan the anjanraja kaa daawa he ki manmohan singh ko is cese main sibiai dwaara maare ja rahe chhaapon kii koi jaankaree hi nahin thi
 He wrote, 'I met the Prime Minister at seven in the evening after the CBI raided the offices of the Ministry of Telecommunications and some telecom companies on 22 October 2009
 piemo main pradhan sachiv tike nair bhi vahiin the
 When i told the PM about the CBI raids, he was shocked
 'yah he puraa maamalasamachar agency pitiai ke mutabik kaig ne spectrum aavanton main 1

 aarope tha ki bina nilaamee ke doorsanchaar spactrum aavantit kiye gaye, isse sarkari khajaane ko baari nuksaan hua
 Now a CBI court has recently acquitted all the accused including Raja in the 2G spectrum allocation case

 Lalit Narayan Mithila University of Bihar is going to start the b
com Part - 1 examination from October 9 and interestingly, Lord Ganesha is also going to sit in this exam
 yah baat sunne main jarurat kuch atapata lag rahaa he, magar sach yah he ki mithila vishvavidhyalay ko lagata he ki bhagwaan ganesh is pariksha main baithenge
 Actually, it happened that the distribution of admit card to the candidates started from Wednesday for the examination starting from October 9
 darbhanga ke rahane vaale krishna kumaar raay naam ke ek parikshaarthi bhi apana admit card praapt karne ke liye mithila vishvavidhyalay ke daftar pahunche, magar unhen us vakt tagada jhatka laga, jabedmit cardamein uske tasviir ke jagah par saakshaat bhagwaan ganesh kii tasviir chhapi hui thi or uske hastakshar ke badale bhagwaan ganesh kaa hastakshar bhi maujuud tha
 The mistake was not limited to just this; Krishna Kumar Rai's home address was also written wrongly in this admit card, that is, the entire admit card was made in god trust
 admit card main gadabadi ko lekar krishna kumaar raay ne kaha ki usne pariksha ke liye form bharne ke dauraan apana naam, pataa or hastakshar samet apana photo chipkaaya tha
 But the question arises from the admit card issued that will Lord Ganesh sit in the b
com exam? Krishna Kumar said that he talked to university officials to rectify this mistake but no one helped him
 krishna kumaar ne kaha ki uske admit card main galati
 The result of negligence of the university as a whole
 vahiin duusari taraf, jab vishvavidhyalay ke aalaa adhikariyon ko is galati kii bhanak lagi to unhone sara dosha us sibar cafe par daal diya jahaan par parikshaarthiyon ke admit card ko taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 Kulanand Yadav, Controller of Examination of Mithila University, said that he will get the mistake made in the admit card investigated
 unhone yah bhi aashwaasan diya ki krishna kumaar ko pariksha dene main kisi prakaar kii dikkat kaa saamana nahin karnaa padegaa
 Significantly, this is not the first time such a mistake has appeared in the admit card of the candidate
 isi saal janvari main ek parikshaarthi ko us vakt kaaphi sharmindagi kaa saamana karnaa padaa, jab uske staff salection kamishan ke admit card par uski tasviir kii jagah ekabhojpuriheroin kii adhanangi tasviir laga di gai thi

 Tata Group is also a partner in airasia India
 nagar vimaanan sachiv aar en choube ne kaha, ‘ham kisi bhi halake se kisi bhi prakaar kii jaankaree kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 'we haven't received anything yet
 ’ mistre ne airesia ke sathtata samoohake vimaanan kshetra ke sanyukt udhyam main ‘naitikta sambandhi’ chintaa jataate hue aarope lagaaya he ki forensik jaanch main 22 karod rupee ke dhokhadhadi vaale lenden kaa khulaasa hua he
 This transaction has been done with entities that did not exist in India and Singapore
 mistre ke airesia india ke khilaaf aaropon par nagar vimaanan mantralay ke ek anya adhikari ne kaha, ‘yadi mantralay ke sangyaan main koi nai baat laai jaati he, to uchit adhikari ise dekhenge
 Mistryko was removed as chairman of the Tata group on Monday
 unka sthaan unke purvavarti ratan tata ne liya he
 Shapoorji Pallonji, a family company of Mistry, is a major construction company and is one of the largest shareholders of the Tata group
 tata sans ke board ke sadasyon ko buudhvaar ko likhe patr main mistre ne aarope lagaaya he ki antarim chairman ratan tata ke vimaanan kshetra se lagaav kii vajah se tata sans ke board ne shuruaati patibaddhta ke vibhinn staron par vimaanan kshetra main puunji nivesh badhaayaa he
 In the letter, Mistry wrote, "board members and trustees know that morality concerns have been raised about some deals in the airasia case and the culture that is engrossed in the organization overall
 ’ isi sandarbh main mistre ne patr main kaha ki ek haalia forensik jaanch main pataa chalaa ki bharat or singapore main aisi ikaayiyon ke saath dhokhadhadi vaale lenden kiye gaye vastav main thim hi nahin
 He also alleged that "venkataraman, the executive trustee, did not give any consideration to the matter and did not encourage further consideration
" venkatraman air asia ke nideshak mandal ke sadsy hone ke saath saath company main shairdharak bhi hai
 He claimed that negotiations with Air Asia were completed by Tata, but during his early tenure as chairman of Tatasons he was asked to propose a joint venture with Air Asia at the Tata Sons board meeting
 apni sarkaar ke teen saal puure hone ke thik ek din pehle 15 may ko pradhanmantri narendra modi narmada nadi ke udgam sthal amarkanta main hajaaron kii bheed se mukhaatib hue
 He was accompanied by Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and other top leaders of the party
 darasal, pradhanmantri yaheen se 16 disambar 2016 ko shuru narmada seva yatra ke samaapan par logon ko nadi seva kaa sankalp dilaane aae the
 There was no such thing as cleaning the river during the yatra which has gone through more than 80 assembly seats in a journey of more than 3,000 km in five months
 sirf jan-jaagran par jor diya gaya, isliye bahut-se log is yatra ko agle saal pradesh main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ke dharmik aagaaj kii tarah dekh rahe hai
 Perhaps this is the reason why Madhya Pradesh Congress President Arun Yadav, who remained silent during the entire journey, did not leave any effort in terming it as politics and corruption in the name of Narmada
 lekin mukhyamantri chouhan aisa nahin maanate
 "the purpose of the yatra was to make people aware of Narmada Maiya," he told India Today
 ab jab log sachet ho gaye hai or lakhon log pratyaksh rup se abhiyaan se jud gaye hai to narmada maiyaa ke sangrakshan kaa jamini kaam shuru hoga
 "by the time, it has happened that the water treatment plants built on the drains falling in the river have become tender
 iske alaava bhavy samaapan samaaroh ke haftebhar pehle chouhan ne bhopal kii prashasnic academy main desh bhar ke jal vigyaniyon or visheshgyon kii kaaryshaala yojit karai
 During this time, the scientists took a step towards making a detailed plan to clean the Narmada
 kaaryshaala main chal rahe satron main chouhan khud ek chaatr kii tarah chupchaap baithe rahe, taaki ve narmada sangrakshan ke vaigyanik pahaluon ko jaan saken
 But it was only in the inaugural session of this workshop that politics was seen
 kendriya paryaavaran mantri anil madhav dave ne narmada seva kaa zikr karte-karte yah bhi kaha, ''raajnneeti kii baarikiyaan main khub jaanata hum
 61-year-old Dave passed away on Thursday
 ve narmada ke kaam main lambey arase se lage the
 Apparently, Chauhan will now be called 'nadi Nayak' in his place
 isi tarah jal sansaadhan mantri hone ke baavjood uma bharti ko bhi yatra main khaas bhoomika nibhaane ko nahin mili
 There was no scope for this journey even for Medha Patkar, who fought the non-political fight to save Narmada and was the leader of Narmada Bachao Andolan
 lekin apni patni ke jevar tak girvee rakhkar narmada kii parikrama kar use saundarya kii nadi narmada jaise yatra vrittant main ukerne vaale lekhak amritlal vegad ko bhi is anushthan main aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 Wegad received the Sahitya Akademi Award in 2004 for the book Narmada of Beauty
 in andekhiyon ke bich congress pradesh adhyaksh yadav ne daawa kiya ki svachh bharat abhiyaan kii rakam se 500-500 ru
 The crowd gathered in the program by spending per capita
 unka yah bhi aarope tha ki 5 lakh logon ko kaarykram main laane par 25 karod ru
 , 4 at breakfast
 12 karod ru
 And Rs 45 lakh on a sore pot
 kharch kiye gaye
 In the words of Yadav, "one drop of the river without cleaning the water, the government has given the entire 1,500 crore rupees
" phoonk die
 "but during the Narmada Yatra, Chauhan, who came out of the scandal like Vyapam, knows how to deal with the allegations
" narmada sangrakshan ke saath hi apane siyaasi rasookh kaa sanvardhan karnaa bhi ve khub jaanate hai or kar bhi rahe hai

 maharashtravaadi gomantak party (emjeepi) or goa forward party ne saaf lahaze main kaha tha ki vah bijepi ke netritv main banane vaali sarkaar ko tabhi samarthan denge jab manohar parrikar ko siem banaaya jaae
 As Parrikar left Goa and took over the post of Defense Minister at the Center after the formation of the government, he was sent to Goa after receiving the affidavit, to clear the way for formation of BJP government in the state
