 One of the many released films this Friday, the film's name is Dhund Leng Manzil Hum
 is film par shaayad kam logon kii nazar pade kyonki film kaa bajet chota he
 It was also not publicized due to lack of money
 lekin hamaari nazar is film par padi to hamane sochaa kii dhund lenge manzil ham ke bare main ham thoda darshakon ko bataa den kyonki film chaahe jis level kii banaai gai ho, magar iskaa vishay or iske banane vaale kii kahani dil ko chooti he
 The film Dhund Leng Manzil Hum is based on the life of children abandoned by parents on the road
 aise anaath bacchon kii zindagi par jo sadak par apni zindagi guzaarte hai
 To fill the stomach choose the waste
 ye film un karodon bacchon ke dukh dard ko bayaan kar rahi he
 Kalyan Ji Jana has made this film
 kalyaan khud ek aisa baccha tha, jise teen saal kii umr main mumbai sthit malad ilaake main uske mata-pita ne chhod diya tha
 Kalyan's childhood was spent picking garbage on the streets of Malad
 dhire-dhire vah bada hua or dance seekhney laga
 Today, Kalyan teaches dance in many schools and colleges
 kalyaan ne apane jaise karodon bacchon se prerana lekar film banaai he
 To tell the world what happens to the pain of children who are orphaned
 is film main kai aise bacchon ne kaam bhi kiya he, jinka bachapan footpath par guzara he
 Kalyan has produced and acted in the film as well
 inke alaava dharmendra singh, sebetina reddy, neha bansal, puja mahatre, shantnu bakshi, mushtak khan, raja muraad, ramesh goyal, ali khan or birbal ne film main bhoomikaayen nibhaai hai
 We also thought it necessary to mention the names of all these actors, because these actors did not take money for this film and helped to bring Kalyan's story to the screen
 film chaahe jaisi bhi ho magar kalyaan kii koshish saraahneey he, jisane zamin se aasmaan chune kii na sirf koshish kii he, balki yateem or besahaara bacchon ko prerana bhi dene kii koshish kii he apni zindagi se or apni film se

 Interestingly, Tariq Anwar has decided to return home and contest on a Congress ticket
 katihaar seat se kul 5 baar saansad ban chuke tarik anwar rashtravaadi congress party kaa saath chhodkar congress ke saath chunavi maidan main utar gaye hai
 However, his association with the Congress is the oldest
 bihar kii rajdhani patna main 16 janvari 1951 ko janm lene vaale tarik anwar kam umr main raajnneeti ke maidan main utar gaye the
 He started doing Congress politics from the early days
 mahaj 25 saal kii umr main tarik anwar bihar pradesh yuva congress ke adhyaksh ban gaye the
 This was the time when all political parties were united against Indira Gandhi-led Congress in the whole country and the country had to face emergency
 bihar main jagannatha mishra or seetaram kesari kii ladaai ne tarik anwar ko bada mauka diya
 Between the two veterans, Tariq Anwar supported Sitaram Kesari and when the Congress (indira) was formed in Delhi, Sitaram Kesari was made treasurer
 yaheen se tarik anwar ke siyaasi safar ko parwaaj mila
 However, before that he also contributed in the field of journalism
 tarik anwar ke ghar main unki patni hina, chaar beti or ek betaa he
 He started his career as a journalist
 tarik anwar ne patna se hindi main saptahik tabloid akhbaar nikaala, jo 1972 se 1974 tak chalaa
 After this, he was the editor of 'yuva Dhara' from 1974 to 1982
 parivaar ke saath tarik anwarasiyaasi safartarik anwar 1976 main indira gandhi congress ke bihar youth brigade ke adhyaksh bane
 He held this post till 1981
 iske baad 1982 se 1985 tak ol india youth congress ke adhyaksh rahe
 Tariq Anwar was the President of Bihar Congress from 1988 to 1989
 is bich wo loksabhaa chunaav bhi ladate rahe
 Tariq Anwar won the first Lok Sabha election in 1985 from Katihar seat
 iske baad wo yaheen se 1987-1988 tak saansad rahe
 He was again elected as an MP from Katihar seat in 1996 and 1998
 1999 main tarik anwar ne bada faisla kiya or congress party kaa saath chhod diya
 Tariq Anwar joined the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)
 unhen ensipi kaa mahasachiv banaaya gaya
 He was then sent to the Rajya Sabha in 2004
 2009 main unhone ensipi ke tikat par chunaav ladaa, lekin wo haar gaye
 However, despite Modi wave across the country in 2014, Tariq Anwarne managed to win from Katihar seat with NCP ticket
 tarik anwar ne kii ghar vapasisonia gandhi ke videshi mul ke mudde par 1999 main congress se baghawat kar ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ke saath milakar rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) kaa gathan karne vaale tarik anwar ne oktober 2018 main ghar vaapasi kii or rahul gandhi ne unka congress main swaagat kiya
 Tariq Anwar resigned from the NCP on the basis of Sharad Pawar's statement on the Rafale issue
 unhone kaha tha ki rafel par ensipi ne jo rukh jaahir kiya he, wo sahi nahin he
 In this way, after leaving the NCP, Tariq Anwar is now contesting from Katihar seat, from where his political guru Sitaram Kesari won the Congress ticket in 1967
 ab tarik anwar kaa muqabla janata dal (united) ke dulaal chandra goswami se hai
 While this time Muhammad Shakur is contesting on Nationalist Congress Party ticket

 Do you know what changes happen in a girl after getting into relationship? 1
 relationships main padane ke baad ladkiyaan der raat tak jagana shuru kar detii hai
 Till late night, talking on the phone, chatting on Facebook and Skype becomes their habit
 iske alaava har samay mobile ko saath liye rakhana unki persenality kaa hissaa ban jaataa he
 2
 jo ladkiyaan relationships main hoti hai unamem achaanak se aaine ke saamne khadey hone or sharmaane kaa shauk punap jaataa he
 Standing in front of a glass for hours and beholding yourself becomes part of their habit
 wo khud ko is tarah dekhati hai jaise isse pehle unhone khud ko dekha hi na ho
 Standing in front of the mirror, looking at yourself from different angles and then thinking about your partner becomes part of their behavior
 3
 After falling in love, girls like to listen to romantic movies, romantic songs
 wo apane mobile main romantic or lav-sogs kii list taiyaar kar leti hai or din bhar apane partner ko yaad kar-karke wo gane sunati rahati hai
 4
 aap chahen to is baat ko nakaaratmak or sakaaratmak donon tarah se dekh sakate hai
 Girls forget themselves after falling in love
 unka sara samay apane partner ke bare main sochane or uske liye tarah-tarah ke sarprise taiyaar karne main hi vyateetahota he
 5
 relationships main aane ke baad ladkiyaan apane pahanaave ko lekar kaaphi badal jaati hai
 They feel that they wear whatever their partner likes
 6
 This change is definitely wrong
 pyaar main padane ke baad ladkiyaan apane saare rishte bhula detii hai

 Plane also could not return to the airport

 Allow a plane to crash

 The pilot chose another route
 halanki ye rasta bhi bahad khatarnaak tha
 But there was no other option
 15 agast 2019 moscow, ruyeebhi ural airlines ke vimaan airbas 321 ne 233 musafiron or kru member ko lekar jukovsky airport se kreemia pheropol ke liye udaan bhari thi
 The plane was still flying in the air that suddenly a flock of birds collides
 pakshi vimaan ke donon injanon main funs gaye the
 Due to which the engine of the aircraft itself stopped
 haalanki vimaan abhi jukovsky airport se chand kilometre kii duuri par hi tha
 So the pilot turned the plane back to land at the airport
 magar ingine band hone kii vajah se uske liye airport tak pahunch paanaa khatre se khaali nahin tha
 Because there were 233 lives at stake
 lihaaza vimaan ke payalat daamir usupov ne plane ko airport se ek kimi pehle hi makai ke ek khet main utaarne kaa faisla kiya
 a passenger traveling in Airbus 321, a Ural Airlines plane, took some pictures with his camera
 landing se pehle zamin se behad kareeb saikadon kimi kii raftaar se wo vimaan kabhi upar ja rahaa he
 So ever coming down
 kyonki payalat ko bhi ye dar lag rahaa tha ki kahin uski ek chook se vimaan main maujuud 233 logon kii zindagi par naa ban aae
 No one can guess that any person sitting in that plane can survive
 lekin moscow ke kheton main chamatkaar hona abhi baaki tha
 Because it is going to be a little hard to believe what you are going to hear now
 kaaphi der tak zamin ke behad nazadik mandaraane ke baad vimaan ke payalat ne aakhirkaar airbas 321 ko aakhirkaar makke ke kheton main utaar diya
 There was a sudden panic in the plane
 kyonki is oobadkhabad khet main vimaan hichkole khaanaa laga
 The only fear was that the aircraft would catch fire
 or tamaam yatri uski bhent naa chadh jaaen
 But believe me miracle happened
 233 logon ko lekar sankado mile kii oonchai se neeche aayaa ye roosi plane makke ke khet main utarane ke baad bhi sahi salaamat rahaa or 233 logon kii jaan batch gai
 It is said that you should not kill Rakhe Saiyan
 ye kahawat moscow ke kheton main sach sabit ho rahi thi
 It was a miracle that even after such a big plane crash, every passenger sitting in the aircraft was safe
 bas paanch bacchon samet 23 musafiron ko maamuli kharonche ai thim
 Those who were released immediately after treatment at the airport itself
 aaiye ab aapako bataate hai ki aakhir ye puraa haadasa hua kaise
 Actually, Ural Airlines aircraft A321 flew from Moscow's Zukowski Airport
 is vimaan main 226 yatri or 7 kru member savaar the
 The aircraft collided with the birds shortly after takeoff
 thodi der baad vimaan bahut teji se hilne laga
 Because of this, the engine of the aircraft caught fire
 vimaan kaa ingine band ho gaya or ise waapas le janaa naammumkin ho gaya
 The pilot had no way left
 vimaan kaa krash hona tay tha
 The lives of the passengers sitting inside came to light
 plane ke andar kaa alam cheekh pukaar kaa tha
 Because the engine was on fire due to birds getting trapped
 or log jalataa hua ingine saaf dekh paa rahe the
 The lights on the right side of the aircraft started to burn and the smell of some burns was constantly coming
 magar maut saamne dekhakar bhi payalat ne hausala nahin khoyaa or immergency landing kaa faisla kiya
 The pilot landed the aircraft in a corn field just a km before it was taken back to Moscow Airport
 jaisi hi vimaan kheton main utraa vaise hi yatri vimaan se utarkar bhaagane lage
 Everyone was afraid that the plane might explode
 haalanki landinh ke fouran baad hi immergency daravaaje khol die gaye or ek ek karke yatriyon ko surakshit nikaal liya gaya
 The news of this accident came to the public through the media
 sab hairaan rah gaye
 And after the miraculous landing of the aircraft, pilot Damir Yusupov became a hero in Russia
 unhen badhaaiyon kaa tantaa diya jane laga
 Surely Yusupov's understanding saved the lives of 233 people on the plane
 kyonki aamtaur par vimaan kaa ingine band hone ke baad itani oonchai se neeche aane main plane ke krash hone kii ashanka bahut bad jaati he or aise haadason main kisi ko bachaa paanaa bhi takreeban naammumkin hi hota he
 And the same thing happened this time
 maut saamne thi lekin kismat in yatriyon ke saath thi
 Just one miracle saved the lives of 233 passengers

 - input bhashaa Venkaiah Naidu and Gopal Krishna Gandhi What came face to face, many of the parliament and the religion of the opposition got caught in the crisis
 purv kendriya mantri or ab endie ke uparashtrapati ke ummidavaar vainkaya naidu ke har party main kai diggaj netaaon ke saath ghanisht rishte hai
 And at the same time, Gopal Krishna Gandhi has close relations with many leaders in the ruling party
 mangalvaar ko subah se hi sansad main paksh or vipaksh ke saansad ekadusre ko majaak main yahi kehete hue sunai die ki 'uparashtrapati kaise chune? ghor dharm sankat he'
 Senior CPI leader d Raja said that Venkaiah Naidu is a very good friend of his but his party has decided to vote for Gopal Krishna Gandhi
 isliye unhen party kii raay se hi janaa padegaa
 On the other hand, the leaders of the Samajwadi Party also said that somewhere there is a grave crisis about who should be elected
 vahiin jab yah sawalgopal krishna gandhise poocha gaya ki bahut saare vipaksh ke netaa venkaiya naidu ke kaaphi kareeb hai or kah rahe hai ki ghor sankat main daal diya gaya he to gopal krishna gandhi ne turant jawaab diya ki bahut saare log satta paksh main hai jo unke kareebi hai or yahi baat kah rahe hai ki kaisaa ghor dharm sankat he
 Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad also jokingly said that the whole country is currently in a religious crisis whether Gandhi will become or the next Vice President of Naidu

 Two weeks ago, there was a press conference in which Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati said from behind the bunch of flowers that what had passed has passed and they are now committed to a historic alliance that results in a politically fruitful region
 mayawati baton ko bhuulakar maaf karne waalon main se nahin hai or unhone us press conference main safataur par kaha ki akhilesh yadav kii samaajawaadee party ke kaaryakartaaon ne 1995 main guest house main jo kiya tha wo bhartiya raajnneeti main neechata kii paraakaashtha thi
 The history between Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav and her father Mulayam Singh Yadav has been quite complicated but those things were never shared
 2002 main mayawati dilli jane vaali flite ke bijness class main baithi thim
 Then 29-year-old Akhilesh Yadav entered the flight, who had won his first election as an MP
 unke saath patni dimple yadav bhi thim
 He saluted the Chief Minister
 mayawati jinhen akasar aalochak ghamandi kehete hai unhone donon ko nahin pahachaanaa to koi jawaab bhi nahin diya
 Padam Singh, who was Mayawati's security officer for 18 years, told of what happened after that
 "dilli main utarane ke baad bahan ji ne mujhase us noujvaan jode ke bare main poocha
 i remember the 1995 guest house scandal when Mayawati was attacked by Samajwadi Party workers, i casually said that they are both Mulayam Singh's sons-in-law Akhilesh and Dimple Yadav
 vah gussa ho gayi or mujhe daptkar boleen, "tumne mujhe kyon nahin bataaya? tumhen mujhe chupchaap se bataa dena chahie tha
 His son-in-law greeted me and i too should have greeted him properly
 tumne mujhe is bare main kuch nahin bataaya
 What must that boy be thinking about me? What would his wife be thinking? This did not go right
 " phir padam singh kaa saamana duusare paksh se hua
 "when i came to pick up my luggage after leaving Mayawati ji, Akhilesh ji was also waiting for his luggage
 main unhen tab se jaanata tha jab main unke pitaaji ke saath kaam karata tha
 He said to me, "padam Singh ji, if sister and we join hands, we can rule this country together
 lekin vidmbana yah he ki itane taqatvar hone ke baavjood ham donon satta se baahar hai
 "A year later, Padam Singh again faced a similar situation in another flight - Mayawati had to go to Delhi and this time her bodyguards were in a panic as the seat next to them was a reserve for the biggest rival Mulayam Singh Yadav
 padam singh kehete hai, "hamen donon main se kisi ek se seat badalane ke liye vinati kerani thi
 i spoke to a leader of the Samajwadi Party and convinced him that Netaji should first sit in the plane
 uske baad main bahan ji ko unki seat kii ore lekar aayaa, jo ki galiyare kii ore thi
 Netaji kept reading newspapers to avoid eye contact
 donon ne ek duusare kii taraf dekha tak nahin
 We were all watching him
 jab plane dilli pahunchaa mulaayam singh ji or bahan ji donon khadey ho gaye or galiyare par ek-duusare ke saamne aa gaye
 Netaji quickly folded his hands and said "namaste sister ji"
 mujhe unka ye bhav behad pasand aayaa
 Not only this, he insisted, "sister, get off first
 " lekin mayawati ne kaha, "nahin, nahin! aapaki seat hamase aage he to pehle aap jaaie
 "padam Singh claims that Mulayam Singh showed great respect and said," sister, you are my sister

 "mayawati is not easy to understand and she is counted among such leaders, whom it is difficult to predict
 padam singh kehete hai ki 2003 main bijepi ne jab loksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar unke saamne gathbandhan kaa prastaav rakhaa to unhone use nakaar diya kyonki unhen bataaya gaya tha ki upi kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se unhen keval 20 hi milengi
 His bodyguard says that Mayawati reacted angrily and said, "shall we play Kanche from 20 seats?" Padam Singh is 69 and worked with Mayawati five years ago
 jab vah upi police ke khufia vibhaag main adhikari the tab 3 june 1995 ko unhen mayawati kaa personal secretary (pieso) niyukt kiya gaya tha
 By then he had worked with four chief ministers, including Mulayam Singh Yadav
 padam singh jatav dalit hai
 That is, they are from the same caste from which Mayawati comes
 ye vahi padam singh hai jo ek baar mayawati kii sandals saaf karte hue camere main kaid ho gaye the
 Padam Singh defends the incident saying that he was just trying to save his boss from slipping and falling while climbing in the helicopter
 wo kehete hai, "barish kii vajah se unki chappalon main keechad lag gaya tha or helicopter chadhate vakt vah phisal sakati thim
 She was preventing me from doing so because she knew that the media would make a point of this
 lekin maine unki nahin suni
 "when asked about the essence of her tenure with Mayawati, she described it as exciting because she was" sister-in-law "
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke pramukh mohan bhagwat ne apni tippaniyon se ek or nayaa vivaad khadaa kar diya he
 He has said that the woman is bound by an agreement with her to look after the husband
 kuch din pehle unhone yah kahkar vivaad khadaa kiya tha ki balaatkaar jaisi ghatnaayen gramin bharat main nahin, balki shahari bharat main hoti hai
 Bhagwat said at a rally in Indore on Saturday, "there is an agreement between husband and wife, under which the husband says that you should take care of my house and i will take care of all your needs
" unhone kaha, is tarah pati qaraar ke niyamon kaa paalan karata he
 As long as the wife follows the agreement, the husband stays with her
 yadi patni qaraar kaa ulanghan karti he, to vah use tyaag saktaa he
 The comments bhagwat kii tippanee par kadi pratikriya vyakt karte hue makapa netaa brunda karaat ne kaha, mujhe yah ascharyajanak nahin lagata, kyonki aakhirkaar vah rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se hi hai

 So whenever they speak in this language, they only show their ideology
 aresas pravaktaa ram madhav ne kaha ki vivaah ke bare main bhagwat ke vichaaron ko bhartiya pariprekshya main puri tarah galat dhang se pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 He said, his views are being misrepresented completely
 unhone (bhagwat) kaha tha ki pashchimi vaivaahik vyavastha ek qaraar hoti he, jahaan stri-purush shaadi ko ek samjhaute ke rup main maanate hai, jabaki unke (bhagwat) kehane kaa matlab yah tha ki bhartiya vivaah vyavastha bahut hi pavitra sanstha he
 a few days ago, he raised controversy by saying that incidents like rape do not take place in rural India, but in urban India
 bhagwat ne shanivaar ko indore main ek raily main kaha, pati or patni ke bich ek qaraar hota he, jiske tahat pati kaa yah kahana hota he ki tumhen mere ghar kii dekhbhaal kerani chahie or main tumhaari sabhi jaruraton kaa dhyaan rakhuunga
 He said, this is how the husband follows the rules of the agreement
 jab tak patni qaraar kaa paalan karti he, pati uske saath rahata he
 If the wife violates the agreement, he may abandon her
 tippaniyan Reacting strongly to Bhagwat's comment, CPI (M) leader Brinda Karat said, "I don't find it surprising, after all, he is from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
" main sochati hum ki yah bharat kii pichhadi soch vaali 'samiti' he
 These are the same elements who wanted a new Constitution of India on the basis of 'manusmriti' during the bjp's reign
 isliye ve jab bhi is bhashaa main baat karte hai, to ve sirf apni vichaardhaara darshaate hai
 RSS spokesperson Ram Madhav said that Bhagwat's views about marriage are being misrepresented in the Indian perspective
 unhone kaha, unke vichaaron ko puri tarah galat dhang se pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 He (bhagwat) had said that the Western matrimonial system is a covenant, where men and women consider marriage as an agreement, whereas what he (bhagwat) meant was that the Indian marriage system is a very sacred institution
 unhone kaha, is tarah pati qaraar ke niyamon kaa paalan karata he
 As long as the wife follows the agreement, the husband stays with her
 yadi patni qaraar kaa ulanghan karti he, to vah use tyaag saktaa he

 Immediately after the launch of the phone, a huge crowd of people were seen outside the electronic shops

 Why the world of Galaxy S4 is one of its most successful products for civilian Samsung and the company has not left any stone unturned in its marketing keeping in mind the status of the phone
 haalanki tadak-bhadak or glamer ke baavjood wo gallexi S4 ke fitures hi hai, jisane graahakon kii jamkar vaahvahee luti he

 kendriya samskruti mantri mahesh sharma ne divangat purv raashtrapati dow
 It made such a statement about APJ Abdul Kalam that now the political mercury is hot on him
 aaj tak ke kaarykram 'sidhi baat' main unhone kaha tha ki kalam musalmaan hone ke ‘baavjood’ ek mahaan rashtravaadi the
 Union Minister Sharma recently talked about freeing the country from 'cultural pollution' and teaching Mahabharata and Ramayana to the students
 unhone aaj tak se baatcheet main kaha, ‘hamane aurangzeb road kaa naam badalakar ek aise vyakti ke naam par kar diya jo ek muslim hone ke 'baavjood' bhi mahaan rashtravaadi the
 After this statement of Mahesh Sharma, opposition parties have intensified the situation
 darasal, sharma kaa bayaan nehru smarak sangrahalay or pustkaalay (enemmal) ke nideshkamahesh rangarajanke istife se paidaa hue vivaad kii prishthbhumi main aayaa he

 He said, Prime Minister Narendra Modi should answer this
 Whatever his ministers are saying, it is also their mind? Owaisi also questioned whether Mahesh Sharma wanted to say that Muslims settled in the country are not nationalists? Let the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) rename Aurangzeb Road in Lutyens Delhi on August 28, APJ Abdul Kalam The road was approved
 kareeb dedh sau baras se bhartiya kanoon kisi mahila kii sahmati ke bina yaa uski ichha ke viruddh yoni main kisi purush ke jananaang pravesh ko balaatkaar maanata rahaa he
 All forms of sexual harassment, such as penetration of the male genitalia into any other part of the body, are not considered rape
 balaatkaar ke kanoon kaa focus stri kii youniktaa ko niyantrit karnaa rahaa he, na ki uski shaareerik swaittata or garima kii raksha
 In this way, the law prepared the ground for tolerating rape
 lekin yah najariya 2013 ke aparaadh kanoon sanshodhan adhinium ke saath hi badal gaya
 The new law now considers rape to penetrate the male genitalia, finger, or any other object in any way against a woman's consent or desire in any part of her body (vagina, ass, or any other)
 yahi nahin, peedita agar aaropee kii hiraasat yaa prabhaav main ho yaa us par bharosa karti ho to aparaadh or sangeen ho jaataa he
 This law therefore creates a new definition and challenges the general view of sexual violence
 tarun tejpal kii vakil gita luthra ne daleel rakhi ki ‘‘aavedak ko jis kanoon ke tahat giraftaar kiya janaa he, vah behad sakht he
 "in response, Judge Prabhudesai commented," The nature of the crime
 
 
 
 Belongs to Gender "and" he has nothing to do with the victim's race, religion, race or his socio-political-financial status
 ’’duusare shabdon main, balaatkaar purush kaa apni pradhanta sabit karne kaa pasandida tarika he
 Men rape not for the frustration of sex but for the fulfillment of their lust
 nyaayadhish prabhudesai ne mana ki saamaajik manyataayen rudhigrast hai or balaatkaar kii shikaayatein chupaane ko baadhya karti hai
 In this sense, the new law challenges those beliefs and attitudes to tolerate sexual violence rather than being merciless
 nyaayadhish ne kaha bhi, ‘‘jis kanoon ko beraham bataaya ja rahaa he, vah darasal aise aparaadhon main behisaab badhotaree par ankush lagane ke makasad se banaaya gaya he
 In this way, every kind of sex violence related to forced penetration of the male genitalia has been changed to mean a male dominated society by considering it a crime against society (rather a cognizable offense)
 yah bhi ki samaaj kitna bardaasht karegaa
 The court also held that due to the perception of social stigma, the victims avoid bringing words like rape to the tongue
 balaatkaar main peedita kaa koi dosha nahin hota phir bhi use hi balaatkaar ke liye protsaahit karne kaa doshi tehraaya jaataa he
 In other words, due to the prevailing perceptions in society about rape, many victims are reluctant to complain or avoid what they say is rape
 balaatkaar peeditaayen akasar khud ko sthaayee shikaar kahalaane yaa balaatkaar ko jite ji mrityu kii tarah dekhne se bachati hai
 People also start seeing rape victims like beings from a different planet
 peedita ko aksar dayaa bhav se dekha jaataa he yaa charitraheen maan liya jaataa he
 Victims who raise their voice against rape are considered worthy of further sexual violence
 mahila patrkaar jab apane kaam ke silsile main balaatkaar par shodh karti hai, us par report likhti hai or apane sampadakon ko use sunaati hai to us vyakti main sex sambandhi bhavanaaen jagaane kaa khatra uthaa rahi hoti hai
 The stories of women who raised their voice or researched against rape and even became victims of sexual harassment or rape are not unknown
 aisi mahilaon ke khilaaf abhadratapurna tareeke se kaam karne ke aarope uchhalte hai, unhen charitraheen yaa unke kaam ko bhadakaau maan liya jaataa he
 Judge Prabhudessai therefore ruled, "from the available material, it is at first sight that the applicant humiliated, tarnished the victim by her activity, which she describes as lighthearted
" ’’adaalat ne agrim jamaanat se inkaar karte hue tark diya, ‘‘mahilaon ke prati samvedansheel kanoonon kaa makasad kanoon par sahi amal or aise aparaadhon kii vistaar se jaanch-padtaal se hi hasil ho saktaa he
 
 
 And it also requires custodial interrogation
 ’’ adaalat ko yah bhi dekhnaa he ki kya aaropee police poochtacha main madad karata he, or kya hiraasat avadhi poochtacha ke liye paryaapt he?adaalat hiraasat main poochtacha ke dauraan police kii ore se maansik yaa shaareerik utpeeda kii sambhaavnaaon ke bare main bhi samvedansheel he, isiilie tejpal ke vakeelon ko unase milane kii ijaajat di gai he
 This reminded us that the rights of the accused are also important, especially when evidence has been found to politicize or sensationalize the case
 aaropee par kaala kapadaa phenkane yaa uske sahyogi ke ghar nemplate par kaalikh potne jaisi harakatein dekhi hi gai hai, jo bheedtantr kii numaaish he
 We have also seen this mobocracy in Delhi's famous gang rape case
 logon ko uske ek abhiyukt kii hiraasat main maut se katai hairaani nahin hui thi
 Historically, this mobocracy has also been opposed to women's rights
 isliye aise karname nyaay ke liye peedita ke sangharsh kaa pratinidhitiv nishchit rup se nahin karte, na uskaa samarthan karte hai
 a woman cannot be allowed to give up the ideal of fair trial in the name of justice
 ham duniya ko badalanaa chaahate hai to sex hinsa ko raajnneeti kaa akhaada nahin banane de sakate, bas uske nyaay kii baat honi chahie

 BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha said on Sunday that his 'dil ki baat' makes him different from other leaders
 haalanki, sinha ne mana ki aksar bhavanaaen unhen apane vash main kar leti hai or yah ‘mahangaa pad jaataa he
 ' sinha ne apije kolkata saahityotsav (akeelef) main kaha, ‘kabhi-kabhi main bhavuk ho jaataa hum
 Then i realize that i am not made for this (for politics)
 main ‘man kii baat’ nahin karata jo mujhe dusron se alag karata he, yah to koi or (pradhanmantri narendra modi) karata he
 i do 'dil ki baat'
 main jo mahasoos karata hum, vahi bol detaa hum jo kabhi-kabhi mahangaa pad jaataa he
 Sinha, who was a cabinet minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, said that there was a time when he thought that politics was not for him and he also wanted to leave it
 unhone kaha, ‘phir main apane mitra or maardarshak laal krishna adwani ji ke paas gaya
 i told him that this would not happen, especially in the BJP
 ’ iske baad unhen mahatma gandhi kii yaad dilaate hue kaha ki ‘pehle ve aapaki andekhi karte hai, phir ve aapkaa majaak udaate hai, phir ve aapse ladate hai or phir aap jeet jate hai

 "many people ask me at what stage i am
" main unase kahata hum - antim do charnon ke bich main
 Shatrughan said that his most political regret is that he contested against Bollywood star Rajesh Khanna

 ’ is chunaav main khanna ne congress ke tikat par chunaav ladaa tha
 On the bjp's debacle in the Bihar elections, Sinha said that some people, not the entire party, are responsible for this
 sinha ne kaha, ''maine unase kaha ki yah na bolen ki bihar main ‘jangalraj’ he
 After all, other parties also have well-wishers and supporters, and it seems that you are calling them 'wild'
 main diwaar par likhi ibaarat ko dekh paa rahaa tha
 i hoped that there would be goodwill in them
 '' Sinha said at the APJ Kolkata Sahityotsav (AKLF), 'sometimes i get emotional

 Mayank breathed a sigh of relief when his wife agreed
 yah paanch saal puraani baat he
 And during this time, the share of rural market in Maruti's total sales has increased from just 10 percent to 30 percent

 During one such journey, Mayank met a modest shopkeeper in Dhanbad, who said that the recession was only for those who read the economic newspaper and watch the business channels
 isse mayank kii ankhen khuleen or unhone apni team ko taakid kar di ki jo kuch padhate or dekhte hai, us par zyada dhyaan na den
 After this, he went out in search of customers who do not care about the recession

 Despite the recession, his business was going well
 ab unke liye bhi ek special package he
 During the meetings of Mathapacchi, he asked his team which section of society earns a lot even in bad times
 jawaab mila, mandir ke pujari, kyonki log zyada puja karte hai or zyada chadhaava dete hai
 Maruti now created a special package for priests, which started at the Trimbakeshwar temple in Nashik

 Their salaries are more or less equal to those in the city, but in Orai, Uttar Pradesh, the monthly cost of a teacher is only twenty percent of that of a teacher in Lucknow
 maaruti ne unke liye guru dakshina kaarykram chalaa diya
 The villagers cannot buy cars from MNREGA income, but have started buying soap, detergents and toothpaste, which has increased the earnings of shopkeepers and they can buy cars
 kul milakar maaruti ke paas chote or pakke graahakon ke liye 332 special package hai
 Mayank says, "the pot fills with a drop

 There has been a 3 percent increase, but the rural market has grown more than 18 percent
 ’’vaise do baaten aisi hai, jo gaanv ke logon ko maaruti car kharidne ke liye pehle se kahin zyada prerit karti hai

 The village has 400 towers and 40 tractors
 par chaar pahiyon vaali yatri sawari sirf paanch hai
 After reading this last figure, Mayank's mustache blossomed
 unka kahana he, ‘‘hamaari 4
 Up to 8 percent of sales are in villages with less than 100 families
 pichley saal hamane 46,000 gaanvon main kaaren bechin
 You would say that the number is very large, but it is only 7 percent of the total villages in the country
 hamaara makasad ise ek lakh tak pahunchane kaa he
 Maruti has opened 500 new sales and service centers at smaller locations in the last five years, thereby expanding the already existing vast network (see here, there and everywhere)

 sujuki kaa kahana he ki kisi ko chalane ke paise nahin die jane chahie
 If an employee walks twenty steps to lift a part, then for every part one has to walk forty steps

 The parts have therefore been brought closer to the assembly line artisans

 Singh says that the artisans have understood that if they have to live, the cost will have to be low and the quality must be maintained
 lekin agar unke iraade kuch or hon, jaise ki 2011 or 2012 main manesar main andolan ke dauraan dekhne ko mili, to kya hoga?santusht shramikgudgaanv factory main kareeb 14 saal tak kaarigaron kii koi samasya nahin rahi
 The story of Manesar is somewhat different
 uski company bhi alag thi-sujuki powertrain india
 It was merged with Maruti in 2012-13
 us company main do bahari agenciyon ke jariye bhartee kaa apana system tha
 Artisans lived in a small rented space, often four in a room, and there was nothing to do after work
 manesar main thekedaaron ke jariye bhartee kaarigaron kaa anupaat bahut zyada tha
 According to some estimates it was over 50 percent
 adhiktar yuva the or apni peedi kii mahatvakanksha ke anuroop bahut jaldi main the

 Old employees in Manesar did not have such an effect
 lekin ab kuch had tak aisa he
 About 150 senior employees were selected from Gurgaon, who lived near the Manesar factory and were transferred there
 phir bhi manesar ke 4,800 karmchaariyon kii ausat aayu 29 varsh he, jabaki gudgaanv ke 7,200 karmchaariyon main yah ausat 35 varsh he
 Chairman Bhargava says that more is happening, "we have got rid of external recruitment companies and contractors

 Now we do a full investigation on where the candidate is coming from, how is his family
 unhen pehle aprentis rakhaa jaataa he or puure saal un par najar rahati he

 The one who is admitted later will go first
 maang badaae par sabase aakhir main nikaala gaya vyakti sabase pehle waapas aayega
 All vacancies of regular employees will be filled from these people
 bhargav kaa kahana he ki iske peeche iraadaa unhen jode rakhane or niyamit karmchaaree banane kii prerana dete rahane kaa he
 About 30 percent of the total permanent employees will come under the new system
 maang main bhi ausatan itnaa hi upar-neeche hota rahata he
 Bhargava says that unfortunately our law does not have any provision to hire temporary employees
 ham karmchaariyon ke maamle main lacheelaapan chaahate hai, kyonki maang ghatati-badhati rahati he
 People hire employees on contract and it is misused
 ham bhartee karke nikaalnaa nahin chaahate
 We want temporary employees
 ham yah bhi chaahate hai ki bharat main saamaajik suraksha kaa koi intjaam ho
 Some other companies are also adopting the same system
 apane vajood ke pehle dedh dashak main maaruti ne factory ke aasapaas chakrapur or bhondsi gaanvon main karmchaariyon ke liye makaan banawaye
 More than 2,000 houses were built and are owned by employees
 company ab yahi vyavastha waapas laana chaahati he
 There is talk of relaxation of building laws from the Haryana government, so that large buildings with small flats can be built in large numbers
 chairman bhargav kaa kahana he ki har karmchaaree ke liye laagat kam karne kaa yahi tarika he
 For this, Maruti will help in raising land, money, architects and contractors

 This seat has become interesting due to the arrival of Urmila Matondkar
 us seat par unka muqabla bijepi (BJP) ke maujuuda saansad gopal shetty (gopal Shetty) se he
 It has been a situation like 2004, where on one side there was Govinda on Congress (congress) ticket and Ramnaik of BJP was the then MP

 In this episode, Bollywood producers and social media, Ashoke Pandit, raised a question related to Urmila Matondkar
 ashok pandit (ashoke Pandit) ne apane twitor acount par likhaa ki urmila matondkar (urmila Matondkar) ko shaadi ke baad, badale hue naam ko lekar janata ke kanfusion ko dur karnaa chahie
 Although it is his right, but if he has done so then why not use the new name in his nomination
 darasal soshal media par urmila matondkar (urmila Matondkar) ko lekar charchaa he ki shaadi ke baad unhone apana naam or dharm badal liya he
 Let us tell you that in the year 2016, Urmila Matondkar married Mohsin Akhtar Mir
 mohsin, urmila se umr main 9 saal chote hai
 # urmilamatondkar herself should clear the doubt raised by people regarding her name being changed post marriage
 It's her absolute right to do that
 But if she has, then why has that name not been used in the nomination form? @ rahulgandhi @ milinddeora Recently Urmila (urmila Matondkar) shared a photo of herself sitting in the temple on her personal Instagram account
 vahaan unhone likhaa tha ki main brev ho chuki hum
 i have no regrets about anything
 bhagwaan kaa dher sara aashirwad, khud ke liye rispect he or pyaar he
 In this post, some users questioned that you have changed religion and name after marriage
 Being brave enough to just be unapologetic for who you are, that's a Goddess

 — taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh)october 7, 2017 Hello, Ravish Kumar, i would have told the results before the Election Commission
 bahut koshish kii wo number bataa duun jo aane vaala he
 The exit poll gave such numbers that it was not understood whether to coach algebra or calculus
 kisi na kisi kaa to sahi ho hi jayega
 i also told a number to some people, but since exit polls have come, everyone is searching for me
 hamane saaf saaf kah diya ki agar agsit pole vaale baar-baar galat hokar baar-baar aa jate hai apana number lekar to main galat hone ke dar se kyon mumbai bhaag jaaun
 So all of you who think that this number will come, send it to NDTV India's Twitter handle @ndtvindia
 endie ko kitna number aayega or mahagathbandhan ko kitna number aayega
 Be careful not to send your numbers after being affected by the exit poll
 tippaniyan This is a difficult choice
 jo bhi jitegaa use jeet thali main rakhkar nahin milegi
 Both sides have fought fiercely
 jiske paas jo bhi ranneeti thi azama lee he
 If someone opened the cow, then he also performed the Harsan of Sarso Mirch
 package se shuru hua chunaav pakistan par chalaa gaya or gavarnence kii baat hote hote gaay kii hone lagi
 Speaking of DNA, Brahmishapak and cannibalism started happening
 par hamaari chunavi raajnneeti kaa str jaisaa he hamaare netaaon ne use bhashaa ke str ke maamle main bhi barkaraar rakhaa
 The battle was such that the weak-hearted people had already escaped from the gathering of those who declared the results before the election
 kuch nahin mila to kaante kii takkar he kaante kii takkar he karne lage
 If only one wins
 reliyon or sabhaaon ke maamle main bhi yah apratyaashit chunaav rahaa
 BJP has fought a lot with its party force
 uske kai netaa aise hai jo sau sau sabhaayen karne kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 The Grand Alliance also did everything it should have done
 uske paas bijepi kii tarah kaaryakartaaon or ranneetikaron kii fouj nahin thi phir bhi uski ladaai kai baar bijepi par baari padi
 The helicopter pilots must have seen Bihar a lot
