 According to the report of an English newspaper, RTI lawyer Chetan Kothari has revealed this in his reply to RTI
 diene main chhapi report ke mutabik, nako ke blad sefti divijan ne 22 june ko artiai main aisi baat kahi he
 Farah Engel, a doctor at Hiranandani Hospital, says on the issue - LGBT has many sexual partners, so they have a higher chance of getting HIV, which is why they are placed in the high risk group
 doctor ne kaha ki blad donneton se pehle echivi test hota he, lekin hameshaa ye 100 fisadi surakshit nahin hote

 "agle paanch saal main 70 lakh rojgaar or swa-rojgaar ke avasar paidaa karne kaa uttar pradesh kii janata ko vaada karte hai
 Friends, in every industry established in Uttar Pradesh, 90 percent of the jobs of the youth of Uttar Pradesh should be ensured only
 mitron, sarkaar banane ke 90 din ke andar sabhi khaali pade sarkari padon kii bhartee karne kii prakriya shuru kar di jaaegi
 
 
 "this statement is of Amit Shah, which he gave while releasing the bjp's manifesto in Lucknow
 janvari, 2017 main amit shah apana yah bayaan BJP ke ghoshnaptr se pard rahe the
 a year later, in December 2018, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath makes one such statement
 "bahut saare log udyog main lag jate hai, anya pradeshon se aa jate hai, bihar, uttar pradesh se, main unki aalochana nahin karnaa chahta hum, par madhya pradesh ke noujvaan rojgaar se vanchit ho jate hai
 70 percent employment will be local
 
 
 "aap donon ke bayaan ko dhyaan se padhein
 Does your attention only go to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar? Who would be angry at the youths who are looking for employment in other states from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar? It is, of course, the same leaders who these days are gimmicking to be their champions
 aisa nahin he ki bihar or uttar pradesh ke hi noujvaan palaayan karte hai, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh se bhi palaayan hota rahata he
 We have to look at this question on two levels
 sthaniktaa ke naam 70 se 90 pratishat naukariyon ko reserve karne se bharat ke sangheey swaroop par kya asar padegaa, vah dhaancha sirf sansthaaon kii imaarat main nahin hota, logon ke zahan main bhi hota he
 Is such a day coming that we will build high walls of cement between states like Donald Trump's America, so that no one can go to another state
 phir aap rojgaar kii vaastavik sthiti or unase judi sansthaaon kaa bhi hisaab kiijie
 Amit Shah promised to give 90 percent of the jobs to local youth in Uttar Pradesh's industries
 kya isse uttar pradesh ke yuvaaon ko zyaada bhala ho gaya? kya us faisle se bihar, madhya pradesh waalon kaa haq maaraa gaya? uttar pradesh main BJP kii sarkaar banane par kitni aisi factory yaa company lagi hai, jinamein 90 pratishat rojgaar uttar pradesh ke yuvaaon ko mila he? pradhanmantri narendra modi ne noida main samsung kii factory kaa udghaatan kiya tha, usee kaa hisaab de den ki 90 pratishat local yuvaaon ko rojgaar mila yaa nahin
 By the way, we also studied the industrial policy of Uttar Pradesh, 90 percent of the employment to local youth could not be seen
 ghoshnapatron ko bhul janaa aam baat he
 In the year 2012, Shivraj Singh Chauhan had said that industries will have to provide 50 percent employment to the local youth
 jo 90 pratishat tak denge, unhen do saal kii tex chhot milegi
 Can the Government of Madhya Pradesh tell how many such industries came after this policy in which local youth got 50 percent employment? Can there be any facts that can better review the impact of this decision? This figure should be given in numbers, not in percent
 kya nae mukhyamantri kamalnath in tathyon par koi shwetapatr janata ke saamne rakh sakate hai? internet par search karenge, to karnataka, maharashtra, gujarat, goa or himachal pradesh main sthaneey naujavaanon ko 70 se 90 pratishat naukari dene kii niti yaa yojana se judi kai khabaren mil jaaengi
 Now in every state, we also take account of the recruitment process of government jobs and the institutions associated with it
 kya uttar pradesh kaa lokseva chayan ayog apane rajya ke naujavaanon ke prati eemaandaar or paardarshee he, kya bihar kaa ayog he, kya madhya pradesh kaa vyapam he? aap inaki naukari dene kaa record dekhie
 There are many jobs, whose advertisement came out, crores of rupees were collected in the name of form fees and that examination was not known
 jo parikshaayen ho gayi, ve bhi dhaandhlee se lekar deree or phir mukademebaazi ke chakra main funskar rah jaati hai
 Amit Shah can tell that according to the promise, the process of filling up how many posts started in Uttar Pradesh in 90 days? Also tell in how many days that process is being completed
 sirf amit shah hi nahin, nitish kumaar, amarinder singh, mamata banerjee sab bataa den
 Just this year, the Uttar Pradesh government recruited about 68,000 assistant teachers
 isi kii pariksha main dhaandhlee ho gai
 The one to be topped was failed and the fellers were passed
 adaalat ke aadesh se copy check hui, to ankit verma topper niklaa, jabaki use fail kar diya gaya tha
 Not only this, 68,000 teachers were reinstated in Akhilesh Yadav's government
 prakriya puri ho gai, magar nai sarkaar ne samiksha ke naam par roak laga di
 After several court orders, they were asked to give jobs, even if they were not given jobs
 naujavaanon ko apane hi rajya se naukari ke liye anginat dharna-pradarshan karnaa padaa
 Many thousands of youth still did not get jobs
 maine 'prime Time' kii naukari series main in chayan aayogon se pareshaan yuvaaon par 50 se adhik episod kiye hai
 i am still doing today, just stopped counting episodes
 aap chahen, to swatantra rup se saare episod nikaalkar audit kar sakate hai
 Rather i want someone to do an independent audit of the job series and its impact
 is series ke dauraan 30,000 se adhik chaatro ko niyuktipatr mila he, jinhen riselt aane ke baad bhi saal-saal bhar se intazaar karnaa pad rahaa tha
 This number is also not final, because i stopped counting after 30,000
 maine is kamyaabi ko apana yaa apane channel kaa dhindhora peetane kaa zariyaa bhi nahin banaaya
 If there was another channel, it would run day and night that our impact got 30,000 appointment letters
 meri yah aadat nahin he
 Whenever the promo team came, it was explained to them that i do not want that
 promo chalegaa, to main yah lod nahin uthaa sakuunga
 Because with one episode, not thousands of messages would come from thousands of young people to show our recruitment problem
 isliye bhi main apni kamyaabi kaa jashn nahin manaa sakaa, kyonki jis vakt asar hone kii khabar aati thi, usee vakt pareshaan naujavaanon ke bhi rote hue massej aane lagate the
 The story of every exam is frightening
 naujavaanon kii umr nikal gai or zindagi barbaad ho gai
 Youngsters call and weep
 aise massej aaj bhi aae hai, jab main yah lekh likh rahaa hum
 It has been a year, but i could not get through the cycle of this job series
 meri haalat yah ho gai ki har episod main bolnaa padataa he ki main naukari se judi sabaki samasya nahin dikhaa saktaa, kyonki mere paas sansaadhan nahin hai
 Not a reporter
 or vaaki itani samasyaayein hai ki main sabakaa nahin dikhaa sakaa, isliye apana dhindhora nahin peet sakaa, kyonki agle kii pidaa meri vaahvahee se zyaada zaruri or gambhir thi
 These youth have been failed by media and governments
 uttar pradesh, bihar ko lekar jo dibet ke naam par nautanki chal rahi he, vah ek din kaa drama bhar he
 The message came this morning that for three years, the recruitment examination of the police officer in Uttar Pradesh could not be completed
 ek saal pehle uttar pradesh police ke bhartee board ne computer oparator kii pariksha radd kii thi, ab tak us pariksha kaa pataa nahin he ki dobaaraa kab hogi
 The Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission in 2013 brought out the form for engineers

 koi logon kaa sapana hota he ki wo videsh main jaakar padhai kare, lekin kai baar jaankaree ke abhaav main aisa nahin ho paata he or kai baar dhokhe kaa shikaar bhi hona pad jaataa he
 Therefore, before going to study abroad, always keep in mind some things, so that you do not face any problem
 
 
 pehle research karen-vaise to har padhai yaa course ke liye research karnaa aavashyak he, lekin videsh main padhai kii baat he to zyada dhyaan rakhana chahie
 Explain that different countries have different systems of studies, so first get information about the patterns etc
 phir is baat kaa bhi dhyaan rakhen ki bahut se deshon main angreji main language nahin he, isliye iskaa pehle hi pataa kar len
 Don't want to do engineering? So, after 12th science, do the recognition of these course courses; Know - Whatever course you want to do, read about it well
 saath hi yah dhyaan main rakhen yah us desh main kyon behatar or uske liye koun-koun se santhaan he
 At the same time, before choosing any program abroad, it should also be verified that what will be the benefit of this in the future career
 darasal videsh main kii hui har padhai hi acchhee nahin hoti he
 Take the information of recognition - Before taking admission in the course, also find out whether the course you have chosen, is also recognized or not
 is baat kaa jarur dhyaan rakhen ki videsh main padhai kaa matlab yah nahin he ki vahaan sab acha hi hoga
 Just like we have frauds here, similarly fake courses are also quite abroad
 neshnal scolership chahie to aise karen applaikharche kaa pataa karen-aakhri samay main aapako fund kii samasya nahin honi chahie
 Especially when your child is ready to go abroad for studies
 iske liye aap brake-ap taiyaar karen or kharch kaa anumaan lagaate samay sahi kharch joden
 Sending to study in the US can cost Rs 25 -50 lakh annually

 This is happening for the first time in the world that such a discount will be given to the passengers flying domestic
 bharat kii airlines vichaar kar rahi hai ki aise hawaii yatriyon ko nakad chhot di jaae jo bagaiyr saamaan yaa bahut kam saamaan ke saath yatra karte hai
 This discount will be from 200 to 300 rupees
 akhbaar ne bataaya he ki civil aviation vibhaag ne aisa prastaav rakhaa he
 The department wants to motivate people to carry at least a few things
 darasal air asia ne jab yatriyon ko saamaan le jane par shulk lenaa shuru kiya to ek vivaad khadaa ho gaya tha
 These airlines used to charge 199 rupees for carrying up to 15 kg from passengers when they were carried, while most other airlines do not charge for them
 baad main usne aisa karnaa band kar diya
 Civil aviation officials, however, prohibited airlines from charging additional passengers
 isi ke tahat ab kam saamaan lekar yatra karne ko protsaahit karnaa shuru kiya ja rahaa he
 In this direction, it has been proposed that discounts should be given to those traveling without luggage
 darasal vimaan main jitna zyada vajan hota he, vah utana hi zyada eendhan peetaa he
 Apart from this, if the airline companies are already aware of how many passengers are carrying with them, then they will fill petrol accordingly
 isse unke petrol kii bachat hogi
 When there is too much petrol in the aircraft, it has to be blown into the air before landing, which is a waste

 Controversy has deepened over the photo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi replacing Mahatma Gandhi on the Khadi village industry calendar

 Vij tweeted that the statement made on Mahatma Gandhi is my personal statement
 kisi kii bhaavana ko aahat naa ho, isliye main ise vaapis letaa hum
 It is worth noting that the calendar and diary of the Khadigram industry has featured a photo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with charkha instead of Mahatma Gandhi this year

 Vij said that Modi has promoted Khadi
 vij ne ye bhi kaha ki sirf khaadi se nahin balki gandhi ab noton se bhi hatenge
 Vij's statement may make BJP and Modi government uncomfortable
 vij ne kaha ki modi zyada bade brands nem hai
 Khadi sales have increased by 14% under his name
 vij kaha ki gandhi kaa naam aisa he jiske judane se khaadi dub gai he
 Modi is a better brand than him, so it is good that Modi has a photo instead of Gandhi

 When Vij was asked why the government had put Gandhi on the new notes, Vij said that he too would withdraw gradually

 The Supreme Court stayed the execution of sentence of Surendra Koli, convicted of Nithari scandal, for a week late Sunday
 coli ko meerut jail main 12 sitambar ko faansee dene kii taiyaari chal rahi thi
 However, Koli's execution was postponed following an order issued by the apex court
 aapako silsilewar tareeke se bataate hai ki yah kaam us din kaise hua
 On Sunday, the evening of 7 September, suddenly a news flies from the Central Jail in Meerut
 khabar ye ki nithari ke gunahagaar sarendra coli ko somvaar subah faansee di ja rahi he
 Since it was Sunday, the court was closed
 aise main jaani:maani vakil indira jaisingh ravivaar raat ko hi supreme court ke chif justise se milane kaa vakt maangati hai
 After this, the special court sits at the house of a senior justice of the Supreme Court at around 10:45 pm
 or phir subah 4:30 baje meerut central jail ko khabar di jaati he ki coli kii faansee 7 dinon ke liye roak do
 7 September 2014 Sunday 9 30 bajeraat hote-hote achaanak khabar aati he ki bahut mumkin he ki somvaar subah nithari ke mujrim surendra coli ko faansee par lataka diya jaae
 For the past few days, there was constant speculation in the media about the hanging of Koli
 par is baar khabar syrius thi
 It was a Sunday holiday in all the courts of the country
 supreme court bhi band
 That is, there is no way to stop the hanging
 coli ko somvaar subah faansee die jane kii khabar udate-udate desh kii purv adishnal solicetre general indira jaisingh ke kaanon tak bhi pahunchati he
 Indira Jaising is in favor of giving Surendra Koli another chance for justice
 ve chaahati hai ki surendra coli ko faansee par latakaane se pehle kanoon ke mutabik open court main uske maamle kii ek baar or sunwaayee ho
 So immediately upon receiving the news, she immediately asks for time to meet Chief Justice RM Lodha of the Supreme Court
 iske liye wo supreme court ke register ko phone karti hai
 One is Sunday
 court band or upar se raat bhi ho chuki he
 In such a situation, there was only one way to reach the Chief Justice
 wo ye ki yaa to unhen phone kiya jaae yaa phir unke ghar kisi special massenger ke zarie sandesh bhijwaya jaae
 On the passing of Indira Jaisingh, the Registrar sends her message to the Chief Justice
 paigaam sunate hi insaaf kii sabase oonchi kursi par baithe justise lodha raat ko hi is maamle kii khaas sunwaayee kaa hukum jari kar dete hai
 For this special hearing, Justice Lodha at the same time makes a special bench of the two most senior judges of the Supreme Court, Justice HL Dattu and Justice AR Dave, and hands over the case to him
 7 sitambar 2014ravivaarrat ke 11
 As soon as the order of the Chief Justice is received, at around 11:45 pm, a special court is set up at the house of Justice HL Dattu
 is special court ke saamne indira jaisingh coli ko faansee die jane se pehle use insaaf kaa ek or mauka die jane kii guzarish kartator hai
 Jaisingh argues that according to an order of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, in cases of execution in which even the review petition has been dismissed, his case should be heard once more in the open court before he is hanged
 Can
 lihaaza surendra coli ko bhi is niyam ke mutabik apni maut se pehle sunwaayee kaa ek or mauka diya janaa chahie
 This case is also very serious because the Supreme Court has already signed his death warrant and even an instant delay in hearing of this case means that Koli can be hanged at any time
 raat bitati ja rahi thi or bahes jari thi
 This special court continued for almost an hour
 iske baad justise dattu or justise dave kii bench indira jaisingh kii daleel sunne ke baad apana faisla sunaati he
 8 September 2014 Monday 12 of the night
 45 bajetab ghadi main raat ke ek bajane main 15 minute baaki tha
 By the end of the hearing, an hour had passed
 ghadi kii suiyon ke saath-saath calendar kii tarikh bhi badal gai thi
 Just then the special court gives its verdict
 surendra coli ke maamle main dobaaraa sunwaayee ke liye indira jaisingh ko ek hafte kaa vaqt dete hue coli kii faansee par bhi hafte bhar ke liye roak laga di jaati he
 But more important and delicate work was still to be done
 adaalat ke faisle ko meerut ke adhikariyon tak sahi vakt par pahunchaana
 That too in a legal way
 lihaaja sabase pehle meerut main dm or esaspi ko phone kiya jaataa he
 He is told to stay awake from sleep and stop the execution of Koli till next week
 saath hi unhen is hukum ke likhit aadesh ke fax kaa inkajar karne ko kaha jaataa he
 September 8, 2014 Monday 3 of night
 45 bajespecial court kaa aadesh fax kii shakl main meerut ke dm or esaspi tak pahunch chukaa tha
 Both confirmed that the Special Bench had received faxes
 8 sitambar 2014somvarsubah ke 4
 That was the time when the jailer of Meerut jail got a written copy of the order of the Supreme Court
 tab tak dm or esaspi phone par jailer ko saat dinon ke liye coli kii faansee roak dene ke supreme court ke hukum kii jaankaree de chuke the
 Shivendra Srivastava with Sanjay Sharma, Delhi, Aaj Tak
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke bich siton ke talmail ko lekar baatcheet kaa daur to shuru ho gaya he
 But in this conversation, no one has opened their cards openly
 donon partiyon main ye to sahmati he ki saath-saath milakar chunaav ladenge, lekin kitni siton par sahmati banegi, seat shering kaa formula kya hoga, jisase sab sammanjanak tareeke se chunaav lard saken, isko lekar jarur uhapoh kii sthiti he
 According to the current situation, BJP has sitting mps on 22 of the total 40 seats in Bihar
 uske baad endie ke ghatak dal ramvilas paswan kii party ke paas 6 siten or upendra kushvaha kii party ke paas teen siten hai
 Overall, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the NDA held 31 of the 40 seats
 2014 main jediu ko mahaj 2 siten mili thim
 Now that JDU is also a part of NDA, the number of seats has increased to 33
 keval 7 siten aisi hai jo vipaksh ke paas hai
 In such a situation, if these 7 seats and 2 won seats are merged, then JDU can get 9 seats either way
 lekin uski koshish isse zyada seat paane kii hai
 JDU contested 25 of the 40 seats in Bihar before splitting from the BJP in 2013 and the BJP had to contend with only 15 seats, but in 2014 Modi wave, the BJP as well as the country strengthened in Bihar
 aise main ab pehle vaali sthiti to jediu ko nahin mil paayegi
 Recently Nitish Kumar said that there is no question of elder brother and younger brother, we are in NDA and will fight elections together
 dilli main hui rashtriya kaaryakaarani kii baithak main bhi unhone yah sanket die the
 JDU leaders believe that in such a situation, BJP and JDU contested 15 seats and got ten seats for Ram Vilas Paswan and Kushwaha's party
 haalanki bijepi shaayad iske liye taiyaar na ho, kyonki uski seating siten 22 hai
 The BJP cannot sacrifice more than two to three seats
 aisi paristhiti main jediu ko 11 yaa 12 siten mil sakati hai
 According to the discussion, JDU can take the seats of Darbhanga and Munger, although the seat of Munger is in the account of Lok Janshakti Party (LJP)
 argedy ko mil saktaa he nitish par hamale kaa maukanithish kumaar ne bhrashtrachaar ke mudde par mahagathabandhan kaa saath chhoda tha
 Now that he has come with the NDA and if his strength is reduced from the first position to the NDA, then RJD will get a chance to target Nitish
 aisi paristhiti main nitish kumaar kii party vidhansabha ke chunaav main bijepi se zyada siton par chunaav ladane kii baat karke apana phase seaving kar sakati he
 However, experts believe that Nitish Kumar himself has taken a slightly softer stance on this matter
 jediu ke netaa ye bhi kah sakate hai ki 2 siton ke badale unhen 12 siten mil rahi hai

 He said that there is a cycle in the Challenger room on which two challengers have to sit and hit the paddle
 jab tak chalanger pedal maarenge tab tak ghar main gas or pani kii supplai hogi, unke pair jab tak chalenge
 Not only this, the family will also have to depend on the challengers to take their luggage from the luggage room
 chaar main se do chalanjaron ko lagaataar cycle par apane pair chalaane honge, unke rukate hi supplai band ho jaaegi
 'bigg Boss' gave Priyanka Jagga the responsibility of monitoring this task
 'big bos' ne unase yah bhi kaha ki yadi vah yah kaam shantipurvak karaane main safal hoti hai to unhen captaini ke liye daavedaari karne kaa mauka diya jayega
 It remains to be seen how long the Challengers can cycle for the needs of the rest of the family and it will also be interesting to see if Priyanka will be able to fulfill her responsibility? subah jab gharavaalon kii neend khuli to yah dekhakar ve chaunk gaye ki washroom or kichan main pani nahin aa rahaa he
 After some time, 'bigg Boss' told the householders about this task
 unhone kaha ki chalanger room main ek saaikal he jisapar do chalanjaron ko baithkar pedal maarani he
 By the time the paddlers hit the pedals, there will be gas and water supply in the house, as long as their feet will run
 itnaa hi nahin gharavaalon ko lages room se apana saamaan lene ke liye bhi chalanjaron par nirbhar rahanaa padegaa
 Two of the four challengers will have to run their feet on the bicycle continuously, the supply will stop as soon as they stop
 is task ko monitor karne kii jimmedaari 'big bos' ne priyanka jagga ko di
 Bigg Boss also told her that if she succeeds in doing this work peacefully, then she will be given a chance to claim for the captaincy
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki baaki gharavaalon kii jaruraton ke liye chalangers kitni der tak cycle chalaa sakate hai or yah bhi dekhnaa rochak hoga ki priyanka apni jimmedaari nibhaa paaengi yaa nahin?

 Speaking about the policy of the party, Amit Shah said that he never gets what he asks for in BJP, he does not get what he asks and sits at his house and this party will continue to go on for 100 years
 2019 kaa chunaav mahatvapurn chunaav he
 It is important for the future of the country to fight it like a war
 kuch yuddh aise hote he jo yug parivartankaree hote hai or 2019 kaa chunaav vaisaa hi yug parivartankaree hoga
 In this war, the people of AAP are playing a very big role
 shah ne kaaryakartaaon kaa hausala badhaate hue kaha ki bijepi kaa kaaryakarta jai or paraajay se na to utsahit hota he na vichlit
 If this had happened, when would the BJP have been divided
 bijepi 2 seat se yahaan tak pahunchi par aaj tak vibhaajan nahin hua
 The highest number of MLA mps are from councilor panchayat member BJP
 virodhiyon par nishaanaa sadhate hue shah bole ki 019 kaa chunaav main do kheme lard rahe hai
 The first was a strong camp led by Modiji
 duusari taraf satta ke laalchee logon kaa morcha
 If we did not lose the battle of Panipat, British rule would never have come in the country
 2019 kaa chunaav panipat kii ladaai jaisaa he
 Today all our opponents have gathered, but i am not afraid of opponents
 vichaardhaara kii ladaai 25 saal peeche chali jaegiamit shah ne bhavishya kii bare main bolte hue kaha ki ek panipat kaa yuddh haarane se 200 saal kii gulaami aa gai thi, vaise hi bijepi 2019 kaa chunaav jitati he to 50 saal tak sansad se lekar panchayat tak 50 saal tak bijepi kaa shashan rahegaa
 The existence of opponents in 2019 will be questioned
 50 saal tak hamako koi nahin roak paaegaa par agar ham 2019 kii ladaai haar gaye to hamaari vichaardhaara kii ladaai 25 saal peeche chali jaaegi
 Describing the alliance as a sham, Shah said that the 2019 election is important for the ideology and the future of the country
 mayawati kahati he hamako majboot nahin majaboor sarkaar chahie
 Today all shops are closed
 gathbandhan se kuch nahin hone vaala he
 This alliance is fraud, nothing is going to happen
 gathbandhan kaa na netaa he na niti havethabandhan kii nitiyon par sawaal uthaate hue amit shah bole ki akhilesh yadav, mamata, chandrababu naidu 
 
 
 All are leaders of their respective states
 duusare rajyon main inke aane se kuch nahin hoga
 After defeating all these, we came to power in 2014
 gathbandhan kaa na netaa he na niti he
 How will they win the election? What will happen in UP when the alliance is not affected? In UP, no matter how much the SP-BSP - Congress gathers, our seats will be 73 to 74 but not 72
 jab upi main gathbandhan kaa asar nahin hone vaala to duusare rajya main kya hoga
 Modi acts like an ascetic, his life never got stained
 jeenyu main desh virdohi baton kaa sandarbh dete hue shah bole ki 2019 main rahul gandhi or congress kaa parivaravaadi kunba hamako chalange karegaa? jeenyu main deshvirohi naare lagane vaale kaa samarthan karne vaale ko janata samarthan karegi? kabhi nahin

 Quattrocchi and Michelle
 
 Neither is our maternal uncle
 
 Neither is uncle
 rafel par supreme court ne doodh kaa doodh or pani kar diya
 Encouraging the workers, Shah said that 9 crore BJP workers are ours and the government has given something to the 22 crore people of the country
 in sabhi 22 karod labhaarthiyon ke ghar bijepi kaaryakarta 26 farvari deep jalaakar ‘camel deepawali’ manaayenge

 In India, there was a lot of discussion about Universal Basic Income (UBI)
 isko lekar antarrashtriya mudra kosh (imef) ne kaha he ki bharat sarkaar chaahe to har saal prati vyakti 2600 rupee kii ubiai de sakati he
 However, this is possible only when the government ends the food and energy subsidy
 imef ne apni ' phiscal monitor - tacling inequality' report main yah baat kahi he
 In order to pay food subsidy, universal basic income in India is discussed in detail in the IMF report
 imef kii taraf se ubiai nikaalane ke liye jo gananaa tay kii gai he, vah 2011-12 ke data ke aadhaar par he
 In such a situation, if the government decides to adopt the UBI, then it will have to consult the current subsidy package in the country and formulate new policies
 jidipi par padegaa 3 fisadi kaa bojhamef ne kaha he ki itani kam ubiai dene kaa vittiya kharch jidipi kaa 3 fisadi hoga
 However, this will eliminate subsidies on public food distribution and fuel
 arvind subrahmanyam kar chuke hai samarthanauniversal basic inakam ko lekar bharat main kaaphi bade str par charchaa hui thi
 Corporates had said that giving UBI would put a burden on the exchequer
 vahiin, mukhya aarthik salaahkaar arvind subramhanyam ne iskaa samarthan kiya tha
 He had said that UBI is an 'idea whose time has probably come
 fouran amal ke liye nahin, lekin kam se kam gambhir saarvajanik vichaar-vimarsh ke liye
 It was suggested to discuss this in the Economic Survey
 In February this year, UBI was discussed in detail in the Economic Survey
 isamen kaha gaya ki ubiai par jidipi ke 4 or 5 fisadi ke bich laagat aegi
 Subrahmanyam said in the report that UBI would not be another scheme but a substituted scheme
 asal main yah akeli yojana hogi jisamen labhaarthi ko sidhe rakam milegi
 Aiming for the poor, Arvind said that there are 950 schemes and sub-schemes that spend 5% of GDP
 inamen se sabase badi 11 yojanaon par hi kul rakam kaa koi 50 fisadi hissaa chalaa jaataa he
 Despite these plans, the poorest people are not benefited

 But here we are going to mention the pain of the elderly mother of a military martyr officer
 unke saath jo beeti use jaanakar aap dang rah jaaenge
 Capt
 Devashish Sharma was martyred in Kashmir in 1994 taking part in 'operation Rakshak' against terrorists
 captain devashish ne doctor hone ke baavjood jo adamya saahas dikhaaya, uske liye tatkaaleen raashtrapati dow shankar dayaal sharma ne unhen 1996 main maranoparant kirti chakra se sammanit kiya
 This Kirti Chakra was the biggest sign for Nirmala Sharma after losing her young son
 lekin 21 oktober 2014 ko ye nishaani bhi unase chhin gai
 In fact, if there was a theft in his house, the thieves also took Devashish's Kirti Chakra along
 kaise shahid hue the captain devashishanirmala sharma ne bataaya ki 1994 main unka betaa dongargarh, kupwada main duty par tha
 At the same time, the army started Operation Rakshak against the terrorists hiding in a building
 captain devashish doctor hone ke naate ghayal sainikon kaa ilaaj kar rahe the
 When a Major rank officer of the army was shot in the building, Devashish went inside for his treatment
 vahiin chhipe ek aatankwaadi ne unki peeth par goli chalaa di
 According to Nirmala Sharma, he was told that Devashish himself followed the terrorist himself and did all his work
 devashish ko ilaaj ke liye helicopter se lift karne kii koshish kii gai to unhone faujee or doctor, donon ke hi kartavya ko nibhaate hue pehle aise ghayal sainikon ko le jane ke liye kaha jinke sir par gambhir chot ai thim
 The helicopter lifts Devashish in the second round but by then the blood had run out
 devashish ne khud ko injection dene kii koshish bhi kii lekin aspataal pahunchane se pehle hi unhone dam tod diya
 The police demanded the money from the martyr's mother
 Nirmala approached the police to get back the son's memorabilia
 police ne maamla darj karne ke baad ghar main kaam karne vaali maid par hi shaq jataayaa
 But she was innocent
 din par din bitate gaye lekin police naa to choron tak pahunch saki or naa hi kirti chakra kaa suraag laga saki
 This was not less
 nirmala sharma us vakt hairaan rah gayi jab kuch pulisavaalon ne processing kaa bahaanaa banaate hue unase paison kii maang kar daali
 Such behavior of the police on the martyrdom of one Ranbankure of the country has ripped even the heart of a mother
 madhya pradesh sarkaar ne diya samuchit karrwai kaa bharosise maamle kii jaankaree madhya pradesh sarkaar tak pahunchi to rajya ke grih mantri bhupendra singh ne samuchit jaanch kaa bharosa diya he
 According to Bhupendra Singh, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been formed and asked to look into the matter
 bhupendra singh kaa kahana he ki kisi bhi doshi ko bakhsha nahin jayega
 When Nirmala Sharma was asked to reveal the identity of those seeking money so that action could be taken against them
 is par nirmala sharma kaa kahana tha ki unhen sajaa mil jaaegi to usase kya haath aayega
 Nirmala Sharma says that she just gets Kirti Chakra, a sign of a son, apart from that she doesn't want anything else
 nirmala sharma ko ummid he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke shuukravaar ko bhopal main shaury smarak ke udghaatan ke liye aane ke dauraan unki vyathaa par sab kaa dhyaan jayega

 Sachin, who has been in the cricket field for 24 years, has turned 46 on 24 April 2019
 is safar ke dauraan unke naam aise-aise record hai, jo ab general nolej main puche jate hai
 On Sachin's 46th birthday, we are telling you about his time when Sachin did not go to play on his first (under-19) Pakistan tour
 under-19 pakistan tour ke liye mumbai ke vankhede stadium main bhartiya team ke sambhavit 25 khilaadiyon kaa camp laga tha
 The camp included players like Nayan Mongia, Sourav Ganguly, Ashish Wiston Zaidi, Gyanendra Pandey, Vijay Bahadur Mishra, Bhupendra Singh Jr, Ajay Jadeja, Vinod Kambli, Jatin Paranjpe
 camp main coach kii bhoomika vaasu paranjape nibhaa rahe the
 Vijay Bahadur Mishra, who was involved in that camp, said that Sachin's selection was supposed to be fixed for the Pakistan (under-19) tour
 camp ke dauraan ek match main sachin ne 70 gendon par shandaar shatak lagaaya tha
 At the same time, the senior Indian team was going to go on the West Indies tour
 sachin ko vishwaas tha ki unka sillection is pradarshan ke baad senior team main ho jayega
 However, he was not selected in the senior team, after which he also looked a bit disappointed
 vijay ne bataaya ki dilip vengskar kii aguwai main team india westeindies tour par ja rahi thi
 At that time, the fast bowlers of the West Indies were in the fire
 sachin kii umr kam thi, shaayad yahi vajah thi ki unako senior team main us vakt maukey nahin mil paaya tha
 It is said that Sachin expressed his desire not to go on his first Pakistan (under-19) tour citing personal reasons after selection was not made in the senior team
 is tour par sachin nahin gaye the
 Vijay says that after this, Sachin got his iron in the Irani Trophy and made a century against Delhi playing for Rest of India
 us vakt dilli kii team tej gendbaajon manoj prabhakar, madan laal, sanjeev sharma hua karte the
 This bowling lineup was heavily beaten by Sachin
 lagaataar damdaar pariyon ke boote aakhirkaar unhone team india main jagah bana lee
 Sachin made his Test debut against Pakistan under the leadership of Srikanth
 is siries main sachin ko vakaar younus kii ball par chot bhi lagi thi
 After getting a place in Team India, Sachin faced every situation with intelligence and slowly became the God of Kickrate on the basis of his performance
 vijay bataate hai ki camp ke dauraan unhen pilia (jaundice) ho gaya tha
 At that time coach Vasu Paranjpe sent him to the hospital with Sachin
 unhone bataaya ki sachin hi mujhe aspataal lekar aae the
 During the camp, Sachin cared for me a lot
 ranjai trophy player ensie level-2 coach vijay bahadur ne bataaya ki unhen 1987 sir main gend se chot lag gai thi
 In 1993, the injury was affected and it was here that his career came to an end
 state bank mainager vijay bahadur bataate hai ki dilli aane par sachin se mulaakaat hoti he
 Hours before departing for the West Indies, Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said here that the ipl's hectic schedule just before the Twenty20 World Cup would not affect the team's chances in the tournament starting on April 30
 dhoni ne kaha ki toornament ke kaarykram ko lekar shikaayat karne kaa koi matlab nahin banataa he kyonki ve jaanate the ki ipel ke samaapt hone ke paanch din baad hi yah shuru ho jayega
 He said, "it is not that we have not played the game
 kabhi kabhi aapako maujuuda kaarykram ke anusaar chalanaa hota he
 Complaints about this do not make any sense
 ’’ dhoni ne bhartiya team ke ravaanaa hone se pehle patrakaron se kaha, ‘‘ipel 25 ko samaapt hua
 After this we got a rest time of one and a half days
 ham puraa ek din vimaan main bithaayenge or vahaan pahunchane ke baad hamen do teen din kaa samay milegaa jo kaaphi hai
 "he said," We have been playing all year
 ham lagbhag 250 se 300 din saath rahe hai isliye mujhe nahin lagata ki yah hamaare liye chintaa kaa vishay he
 If we play to our potential, if each player plays in his role and responsibility, i think we have a good potential
 isliye ham sarvshereshth pradarshan kii aashaa kar rahe hai

 He said that the Modi government is ruining the institutions at the behest of RSS
 rahul gandhi ne modi sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki beete saadhe chaar saalon main sarkaar ne madhyam varg ke liye kuch bhi nahin kiya
 Rahul Gandhi said that i have benefited greatly from the abuses that the BJP and the Sangh have given me so far
 main narendra modi se nafrat nahin karata, magar unki or meri vichaardhaara alag he, main unase ladata rahoonga
 Rahul said that no matter how much you hate me, i will only talk to you with love
 rahul gandhi se ek sawaal poocha gaya ki aapane loktantric sansthaanon ko sarkaar dwaara barbaad karne kii baat kahi thi, to is par rahul gandhi ne jawaab main kaha ki abhi desh main sirf ek hi santhaan he jise aresas kehete hai
 She is the mother of BJP
 yah desh ke anya sabhi santhaan par haaavee he
 The Congress does not believe that the institution should not be left independent
 hamen lagata he har santhaan kii apni pahchaan he or use itani swatantraaa honi chahie jisase vah desh or apni behatari ke liye behatar kaam kar paae
 But bjp's mindset is different

 In response, Rahul Gandhi said that it is not that all parties ignore the middle class
 hamaari party ne apane shashan kaal main sabase zyada kaam madhyavarg ke liye kiya
 i want to tell you that what the Congress party wants to do for the middle class is - it is necessary to abolish one's grandeur on the education system, similarly there is a need to end one's grandeur in the health sector as well '
 unhone aage kaha ki aise halaat banane kii jarurat he jisamen madhyavarg ke log bhi apane bacchon ko ucch stareey shiksha dilaa saken
 Like iits, there is a need to open more new institutions in the public sector

 We need to create more and more jobs for the middle class

 yoga sanskrit shabd 'yuji' se bana he
 The word yoga literally means to join or meet
 yoga se sehat ko beshumaar laabh pahunchataa he
 It is a great option to keep away from heart disease
 niyamit taur par yoga karne se dimag ko shanti milti he or tanaav kam hota he
 But while doing yoga it is very important to keep some things in mind
 yoga karte samay in baton kaa rakhen dhyaan:samay kii pabandi-koshish karen ki aap apni yoga class ke liye samay se 10 minute pehle pahunchen
 This will allow you to choose the right place for you
 iske alaava class ke shuru hone se pehle ke samay main aap alag-alag tarah ke yogasana tri kar sakate hai
 Do not eat anything until 2-3 hours before the start of class - avoid eating anything for about 2 to 3 hours before doing yoga
 kyonki agar aap khaanaa khaakar yoga karte hai to aapako sharir main anthan mahasoos ho sakati he
 May cause nausea and vomiting
 darasal, sharir ko khaanaa diguest karne me kaaphi energy lagati he, jiske kaaran aapako yoga karte samay thakaavat kaa ehsaas ho saktaa he
 The enemy of the heart is excess sleep, you may have a heart attack
 Give information related to your injury to your yoga teacher - if you have any kind of injury in your body and you feel difficulty in doing any yoga pose, then its Do inform your yoga teacher
 mobile ko class main naa le jaaen-yoga karte samay jaruri he ki aap apana puraa dhyaan baaki chizon se hataakar sirf apni yogasana par hi lagaaein
 Do not carry mobile in class
 kyonki isse aapkaa dhyaan bhatakta rahegaa
 Do not talk in class - it is a good habit to talk to people in your class
 lekin yoga class main jitna ho sake kam baat karen
 Because this will distract your attention as well as other people will not be able to pay attention in their yoga
 tauliye ko saath rakhen-yoga class main tolie yaa roomaal ko saath lekar jaaen
 So that when sweating you can clean the sweat
 zyada utsaah main aakar yogasana na karen-utsaah main aakar kisi mudra ko jabardastee karne kii koshish naa karen
 This can cause cramps in your body
 balki dhire-dhire samay lekar karne kii koshish karen
 Delhi's air has become dangerous, include it in food
 These things go in the class ahead of time - punctuality is necessary to do any work properly
 isliye yoga kii class main samay se pehle jaaen or class khatm hone ke baad hi class se nikalen, taaki aapaki vajah se kisi duusare ko pareshaani naa ho
 Repeat all postures after class - if you want to perfect yourself in yoga as soon as possible, come home and try all the postures again in free time
 class main jo bataaya unamem se jaruri baton ko likhakar apane paas rakhen
 Keep reading these points from time to time
 taaki jo aapane siikhaa use aap bhul na paaen

 According to the report, people are searching for employment but they are feeling disappointed
 yah sanket khatre kii ghanti he
 In fact, there is an atmosphere of economic slowdown in the country
 is vajah se lagbhag har sector main chantni kii khabaren aa rahi hai
 Let us know that in the last few months, more than 2 lakh jobs have been lost in the automobile sector of the country
 isi tarah textile sector, emmemasiji sector or real estate sector main bhi naukariyon par sankat ke badal mandara rahe hai
 In the General Headquarters (GHQ) in the military cantonment city of Rawalpindi in Pakistan, a crowd of fans surrounded Raheel Sharif, the 15th Army Chief of the Pakistani Army, with a mustache, on a summer night of 2014
 us din dephence de tha
 The army was slowly beginning to come out of the shells of the sanctions of the terrorist threats of the Musharraf era and the Kayani era
 dashak bhar se zyada samay ke avrodh ke baad saarvajanik parade, jisamen kuch chuninda log aalaa afasaron se baat kar sakate the, phir se shuru kii ja rahi thi
 Opposition leader Imran Khan was sitting on a dharna demanding election reforms in Islamabad, about a 40-minute drive from there
 imran ko ummid thi ki unke dharne main hajaaron kii bheed jutegi or taharir squaire jaisi sthiti paidaa ho jaaegi jiske baad pradhanmantri navaj sharif ko dabaav ke aage jhukna padegaa or istipha dene par majaboor hona padegaa
 The top generals of the GHQ were divided over whether they should favor the government that disliked the military or supported the opposition that supported it
 jis samay raahil ke irdagird juty bheed chantane kaa naam nahin le rahi thi or general ke saath selfi lene waalon kaa tantaa laga hua tha, usee samay thodi duuri par chaude kandhe vaala lambey kad kaa ek shaks akelaa khadaa hua tha jise chote kad vaale sainikon kii baaten jhukkar sunne kii aadat thi
 He was turning one hand behind and gently slapping his leg on the other hand with an army stick
 vah shaks koi or nahin balki leftinent general qamar javed bajva tha, pakistan kii sabase bade military formation eks kor kaa tatkaaleen commander
 Unlike all the people at the GHQ parade ground, Bajwa was looking at the martyrs' memorial made of black granite, not towards a crowded Raheel Sharif like a celebrity
 us raat or aane vaale kuch maheenon tak bajva ke is tarah bheed se alag-thalag ekadam akele khadey rahane kii vajah bhi thi
 At GHQ, he was one of only a few people who were advising to maintain democracy and elected government in times of circumstances like the ongoing home rift in Islamabad, and were advocates of marginalizing the strength of the 111 Brigade
 haalanki unhen eks kor ke pramukh ke pad se hataakar daftar main baithne vaale saadhaaran-si jimmedaari vaale pad par bhej diya gaya
 Still, he was against the star-like status associated with the army chief's secretariat and was known only to some of his close friend colleagues
 lekin antat loktantr kaa pakshdhar hone kii unki pratishtha kaam ai or unki vardi par chauthaa sitara jud gaya yani ve pakistan kii jameen par sabase taqatvar pad par asin ho gaye
 After being in the post for more than a year and trying to regain the reputation of a non-political army chief, the country's largest military officers have been caught in a vicious political dispute
 desh jab kisi sainya yaa nyaayik baadha ke bina tisare aitihaasik aam chunaav kii taiyaari kar rahaa he, tabhi america kii ore se pakistan par pratibandh laga die gaye hai or aage bhi kuch or pratibandh lagaae ja sakate hai, jiske kaaran america ke saath uske rishton main kadavaahat aa gai he
 In such a situation, General Bajwa and his army of 6 lakh soldiers — considered to be the most powerful organization in the country — appear to be on the defensive although they are rapidly trying to regain their lost status
 balooch regiment ke is 57 varshiya infentry ke afasar kaa neshnal security plan "bajva doctrin'' baari vivaad kaa vishay ban gaya he jo pakistan main naagarik or military ke bich daraar ko darshata he
 The controversy has come at a time when there is a conflict between partisan politics and the judiciary and ruling in the country — but also the anti-military — Sharif's governance apparatus and his colleagues in the bureaucracy and the media
 pichley saal july main pakistan ke supreme court kii ore se sharif kii ravaanagi ke peeche sena kaa haath mana ja rahaa tha
 The charge on the army was propagated on behalf of the Sharif camp
 lekin sena—jisane aazaadee ke baad se saat dashakon main se teen dashak tak pratyaksh rup se shashan kiya he—is aarope ko purajor tareeke se khaarij karti he
 But after surviving the traces of Pakistani media for 16 months in a row, Bajwa got off to a new start by talking to journalists unofficially in March
 na hi is baatcheet kii gopneeyata or na hi isaki samvedansheeltaa ko kaayam rakhaa ja sakaa
 Soon after, one columnist made this four-star military officer's conversation completely public
 bharat ke saath sambandhon ko saamaanya bananaa, afghanistan ke maamle main america dabaav ke aage na jhukna, jihadiyon ko mukhyadhara main laakar chunavi raajnneeti main laana, ladkadaati arthvyavastha kii dasha, samvidhan main khamiyaan, sharif ke parivaar kaa sankat, cabinet ke kuch mantriyon kaa samarthan, or nyaaypalika ke prati sena kaa puraa samarthan jaise rajnatik rup se jwalanth mudde baatcheet kaa vishay the or unhen bajva doctrin ke taur par dekha gaya
 The results of this conversation then emerged, criticizing it in editorial articles
 soshal media main khub bahasein huin
 Critics of the army came into the fray from Pakistan's Left
 bajva ko pakshpaati bataaya gaya or apane daayre se baahar jane ke liye unki aalochana kii gai
 But in a country where the military has a strong support of the people (according to the 2017 Gallup Survey, the army has 79 percent support) when Bajwa's India-related strategy — Kashmir's hate-terror or war Not to be resolved - it was discussed and praised almost entirely, then the army then escorted the defense attache of India and other guests of the South Block at the Pakistan Day Parade on 23 March invited
 pakistan kii sena ke liye aisa karne kaa yah pehla mauka he, jo bharat ke saath teen jang lard chuki he
 Former Major General Isfandiyar Pataudi of the Interservices Intelligence (ISI) Directorate who has worked with Bajwa for a long time says, "army chiefs have a deeper understanding of pragmatic politics and have created regional strategies and neighbors strategy more than ultra-regional partners Used it better in making
 ''is doctrin ko saamne rakhane ke turant baad asaamaanya dhang se media main udaaravaadi takaton—jinamein jang samooh sabase aage rahaa he or jiske akhbaar or prasaranon par sena kii ore se sanchalit cantonmenton main pratibandh laga hua he (sena ke is kadam ko bajva kaa samarthan hasil he) ne general kii tarif kii
 Columnist Suhail Varraich thanked Bajwa for sidelining 70 years of militant nationalism and leading Pakistan to the principle of pragmatism that emphasizes peace with neighbors
 lekin har koi isse khush nahin tha
 Social media took a hard stand on Bajwa's theory
 unki is theory ke tahat baari hathiyaaron se las or acchhee tarah se prashikshit kattarpanthi tatwon ko bhumigat hone ke liye majaboor hone se pehle mukhyadhara main laane kaa prayaas karne kii yojana he
 Pataudi states, "bringing the fundamentalists into the mainstream should not be misconstrued that terrorists are being brought into politics
" 
 
 yah jaruri he ki jo log kattarpanthi vichaar rakhte hai unhen bhi rajnatik abhivyakti kaa avasar milanaa chahie
 It is possible that by doing so, they leave the path of violence
 ''pakistan main sainik shashan ke puraane record ko dekhte hue kuch logon ko sena kii manshaa ko lekar andeh rahaa he
 a TV anchor invited to the Meet and Greet program at the General HQ says, "it felt like we were meeting a new king
 ''uske mutabik, unki body language or aatmavishvaas ko dekhakar aisa lag rahaa tha jaise koi badshaah jo jaruri sudhaar karnaa chahta he, ritairement ke baad bhi shaayad kuch samay tak rahegaa
 But Bajwa's system reiterates that he has been a non-political military officer and the army assures that the general elections will be held at their scheduled time which may be held at the end of summer
 haalanki ve un thode se leftinent generalon main se ek rahe hai jisane 2014 main uthal-puthal ke dauraan apane purvavarti ko sainik adhigrahan ke khilaaf saavdhaan kiya tha lekin loktantric prakriya kii kamajori or rajnatik rup se samvedansheel vakt main apni doctrin saamne rakhane par don akhbaar ne apane sampadakeey main isaki aalochana kii thiah "loktantr kii disha main badhata kadam samay par hone vaale lagaataar tisare aam chunaav kii taraf bad rahaa he, lekin loktantric yojana kinhin roopon main khatre main hai
 In such a period of uncertainty, the comment of an army chief can be seen as questioning the legitimacy of democracy
 ''jab se vivaad shuru hua he sena ne in ghoshnaaon ke saath apni pratikriya di haih "bajva doctrin'' suraksha se sambandhit he raajnneeti se bilkul nahin
 Pataudi dismisses Bajwa's criticism
 ve kehete hai, "ve niti-nirmaataaon ko salaah dene ke maamle main kaaphi paripakv vyakti hai or apni tarakkee yaa apana naam kamaane kii chahat nahin rakhte hai
 Pakistan has many problems and one needs to ask difficult questions
 general bajva unheen sawaalon ko uthaa rahe hai
 "it will be interesting to see how the relationship between democracy and the military goes ahead in this country

 According to the news agency Xinhua, Jameel's death has not been officially confirmed yet

 In the winter session of Parliament, opposition unity on the issue of Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti's objectionable statement is now visible in even more important issues
 yojana ayog ke nae swaroop ko lekar ravivaar ko bulaai gai mukhyamantriyon kii baithak ke liye vipakshi partiyon ne nae sire se golbandi kar lee he
 This meeting to be held at the Prime Minister's residence will be in two parts
 pehle satr main pradhanmantri nae ayog ke bare main mukhyamantriyon ke suzav sunenge or duusare satr main anya muddon par charchaa hogi
 Congress has taken the initiative of opposition unity
 congress ko is baat par etraj he ki bina rajya sarkaron se salaah-mashvira kiye pradhanmantri ne laal kile se yojana ayog ko samaapt karne kaa elaan kaise kar diya
 Chief Ministers of Congress-ruled states had also written a letter to the Prime Minister and protested, saying that it was against the federal structure
 ab ravivaar kii baithak ke liye vipaksh kii saajha ranneeti bani he
 The Chief Ministers of other opposition parties have been approached by the Congress
 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee, uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav, bihar ke mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi or tripura ke mukhyamantri maanik sarkaar ko is baat ke liye manaaya gaya he ki ve ravivaar kii baithak main yojana ayog ko punargathit karne ke faisle kaa virodh karen
 Actually, the Planning Commission is an emotional issue for Congress
 gujarat ke haripura main 1938 netaji subhash chandra bose kii adhyakshata main hue bhartiya rashtriya congress ke adhiveshan main pehali baar yojana ayog jaisi sanstha kaa khaakaa saamne rakhaa gaya tha
 The Planning Board worked from 1944 to 1946 in the British Raj as well
 bharat ke swatantra hone ke baad march 1950 main pehle pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru kii adhyakshata main yojana ayog kii sthapana kii gai thi
 This is the reason why even during the UPA government there has been talk of abolishing the Planning Commission, but now that it is going to happen, Congress is calling it an attack on the federal structure
 vaise ye tay mana ja rahaa he vipaksh ke virodh ke baavjood modi sarkaar yojana ayog kii jagah duusari sanstha ko laane kii apni yojana ko puraa karegi
 But it is also certain that only the look and feel of the Planning Commission will change
 ye sanstha koi doosraa chola odh kar pehle kii tarah kaam karti rahegi
 There will also be no change in its work
 lekin iske virodh ke liye sabhi vipakshi dalon kaa saath aana sarkaar ke liye ek nai mushkil paidaa kar saktaa he
 Especially when it does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha and a socialist family is gathering
 trinmul congress ke tevar behad tikhe hai or lok sabha chunaav main karaari haar se ladkadai congress bhi sarkaar ko zyada riyaayat dene ke mood main nahin he

 Narendra Modi, who has made a hat-trick of victory in Gujarat, has been told for a long time that his heart is going to come to Delhi
 siyasat kii galiyaaron main bhi sabase garmagaram khabar yahi he kimodi kii entry bijepi kii kendriya raajnneeti main hone ja rahi he, bas naam kaa elaan bhar hona he
 Modi's intervention in Delhi's politics: Narendra Damodarbhai Modi, who put a hat-trick of victory in Gujarat, will still remain in the hands of Gujarat, but his interference in Delhi's politics has increased and certainly dominates
 ho saktaa he ki ravivaar ko modi ke kismat kaa suraj dilli main chamake
 It is believed that Modi will be elected in the bjp's highest policy making body, the party's parliamentary board
 sansadeey board main modi kaa aana taymukhyamantri to or bhi hai bijepi main
 Those who rule in their respective states with full humility and intimidation, but their politics has been confined till the fortnight of their state
 modi bhi mukhyamantri hai, lekin kad or pad kaa dayera itnaa bad gaya ki dilli dur nahin vaali kahawat ko inhone jhuthla diya
 Modi's entry into the parliamentary board is considered a mere formality
 aakhir party ke adhyaksh se lekar duusare bade netaa to maheenon se modi kii tarif main kaside pard rahe hai
 Modi's participation in many important decisions will increase
 After 6 years, bjp's politics has changed on the pretext of Modi
 yahi rajnath the, jinhone farvari 2006 main modi ko sansadeey board kaa sadsy banaaya tha lekin 2007 main jab bijepi ke baqayada adhyaksh bane to march ke maheene main modi ko hataa diya
 The argument was made that the Chief Minister is in more states, why should he be discriminated against
 lekin 6 saal main modi ke saamne bijepi puure 360 degree par gum chuki he
 The Parliamentary Board of the BJP consists of eleven members along with the Speaker
 party ke saare ahm faisle sansadeey board hi letaa he
 If Modi comes to the BJP Parliamentary Board, now Modi's participation in many important decisions will increase not only in Gujarat but also in other states
 vaise bhi modi dilli main apana dabadabaa dikhaane ke liye apane kuch karibiyon ko edjust karne main lage hai
 Amit Shah may become General Secretary There is a lot of possibility that Amit Shah, close to Modi and former Minister of State for Home Affairs of Gujarat, will be made the General Secretary
 vaise hi modi ke ek or kareebi rajasthan bijepi ke purv adhyaksh om maathur ko bhi mahasachiv banaae jane kii sambhaavna he
 Modi can make former Gujarat BJP president Purushottam Rupala a vice president
 ishaara saaf he ki gujarat main jeet kii hetric lagane vaale modi ab kshatrap kii seemaa main samaa nahin rahe hai
 They need a larger scope and they can only be met with a central role
 india today conklev main bhi modi ne baton-baton main bataa diya tha ki kaise wo dilli main date hue hai

 Satyapal Singh, BJP MP and former commissioner of Mumbai, said, 'prime Minister Narendra Modi's campaign has paid off
 ab UN ko bhi pakistan ko aatanki desh ghoshit karnaa chahie
 After that the US should also impose economic sanctions on Pakistan

 Individual Freedom remembered that the Indian tradition contained the values of personal freedom and the Constitution also gave the right to privacy
 un adhikaron kii baat lekhika ne apni pustak kii prastaavna main hi kii he
 This book, as it is known by its name, emphasizes the question as to why a person can be a liberal, as much as it emphasizes why a liberal is needed? When there is a breach in the well of the social psyche, then it becomes meaningless to talk of understanding, but in this book, there is an attempt to remove that breach and to test the true complexion of India
 lekhika ne is baat par bal diya he ki agar hindustan kii sabase bady pahchaan mahatma gandhi hai to us gandhi kii sabase badi pahchaan yah he ki vah sabase bade udaarpanthi netaa the
 Gandhi removed this generosity from the Indian tradition and became part of the tradition of political fight against slavery
 dharmik udaartaa uski pehali buniyaad bani jisapar aarthik or saamaajik udaartaa kii bhavy imaarat taiyaar hui
 The political thinking of that Gandhi knew that the state is a big danger and a big state becomes a bearer of great danger
 mahaan samajashastri em en shrinivas ne likhaa he ki mahatma gandhi sirf bharat ke hi rashtrapita nahin the balki bhartiya udaaravaadi vyavastha ke bhi pita the
 Then this political Hindu was killed by a political Hindu or a Brahminical Hindu? Sagarika Ghosh has tried to explain the very fine mix of Hinduism and Brahminism without naming it
 aakhir udaartaa kii khilaafat, sabase badi khilaafat, dharm kaa karmkand karata he or kisi bhi dharm ke karmkand par chot karo to usko chalaane vaale hi bilabilaate hai
 Gandhi is known as the largest Hindu in the world
 to kya gandhi ke vyaktitv kii khushboo ko khud main samahit karne vaale hindu dharm kii pahchaan se kattarta se poshit hindutv dar gaya tha or usee dar ne mahatma kii jaan le lee? nahin to aisa kyon hota ki bharat aaj bhi duniya ke saamne ek pitruhanta raashtra ke rup main khadaa hota? yah hamaari dharmik chetana par bada prashn chihn he or is prashn chihn ko sagarika ne rekhaankit kiya he
 Today, the way the country is caught in the shackles of Hinduism-based nationalism, the logic of rationality becomes meaningless
 unmaad kii sabase badi khaasiyat yahi hoti he ki vah hamaari tark shakti ko khatm kar detaa he
 Then we see God as a human being, not as a human being, or as a devil
 jab insaan kii apni pahchaan devatv yaa daanavtaa kii bhatthi main galane lagati he to use apane tamaam sawaalon ke jawaab ke liye or apni tamaam samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye ek adad raashtra nayak kii jarurat pad jaati he
 Then all the elements contained in the nation start revolving around a person's personality
 raashtra aahista-aahista gaun ho jaataa he or nayak sarvasv
 This threat was realized by Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar while formulating the constitution
 isiilie sardaar vallabh bhai patel ko unhone likhaa tha ki desh sabase bade aadmi se bhi bada hota he
 Later, this was marked by the powerful leader Meenu Masane as the rise and threat of masculine nationalism
 is mardaana rashtrawaad kii pehali shart samaaj ko do bhaagon main baantnaa or usamen bahusankhyak kaa hami bananaa ho jaati he
 Its second condition is to incite hatred in the society
 vah nafrat hi he jisamen ham itihaas se bhi koi sabak lenaa nahin chaahate
 Leaders of any national movement, from Mahatma Gandhi to Nehru and Patel, did not do politics hating the British, but also learned from them when needed
 lekin aaj satta se har sawaal puraani satta kii naakaamiyon par bade sawalia nishaan ko hi apana jawaab maanata he
 Its third condition is that elements of nationality be found in symbols
 sagarika likhti hai ki 2014 main jab smriti irani maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri ban gayi to unhone sabhi vishvavidhyalayon main tirangaa fahraane kaa aadesh diya
 The tricolor is a symbol of every Indian's pride, but when that pride is forcibly imposed on you, society starts turning into hell
 phir sabake apane apane unmaad paidaa hote hai jinamein bahusnkhyakon kaa unmaad hi rashtrawaad ban jaataa he
 Manly Nationalism
 patrkaar rahi lekhika sagarika ghosh ne apane sandarbhon, vyakhyaaon, itihaas ke tatwon, vartmaan kii paristhitiyon or bhavishya kii aahaton ke bich apni kitaab ko paanch adhyyon main baanta he
 Since the patriotism of every person who raises questions in the country is first questioned
 shaayad usee sawaal se takaraane ke liye apane pehle adhyay kaa naam rakhaa he The Liberal Patriot yani udaarpanthi deshbhakt
 That liberal patriot does not see every question as a reaction to action
 tabhi to sansad par aatanki hamale ke doshi afjal guru ke bete gaalib guru ke prati vah udaar dikhataa he
 His generosity also springs to those secular values, which are said to be the pioneers of neo-nationalism
 is adhyay main hamaari raajnneetik saamaajik drushti khulti he to kashmir se lekar duusare kai buniyadi sawaal bhi apana jawaab dhundhate hai
 The second chapter is The Liberal Hindu
 hindutv aatma ko pahchaanane kii baat karata he
 The greatest interpretation of the soul is in the Gita, and Mahatma Gandhi introduced the Gita in the context of a new era
 aaj goraksha ke naam par jis tarah daliton or musalamaanon kii mob linching ho jaati he, usamen gandhi kaa sandarbh samajhane laayak he
 Gandhi was not in favor of cow slaughter but he also said that his religion does not allow those who kill cow
 phir usee hindutv kii ek vyakhya itani hinsak kyon ho jaati he? sagarika ghosh is adhyay main bijepi ke nae vikaas model or usamen dharm or nafrat ke ghalmail par behad sookshm drushti daalati hai
 In how many contradictions does our society live and our dharma karma and society's contractors make Nehru a villain and Bhagat Singh a hero on the basis of convenient thinking
 jabaki bhagat singh ne dharm kii raajnneeti or kaarobaar chalaane waalon ko karaara jawaab apane aitihaasik lekh se de diya tha jiskaa naam tha ki main naastik kyon hum
 When Sagarika raises the issue of a liberal Hindu, the Tursi with which she questions the radical politics of the BJP, in the same manner, on the appeasement politics of the Congress in which the decision of the Supreme Court in Shahbano case was changed on the strength of the Parliament i went
 tisare adhyay main sagarika udaarpanthi vichaarkon kii baat karti hai jiskaa naam diya he The Liberal Thinker
 In this, she talks about the idea, not the ideology, because today people of a certain kind of thinking on ideology have understood their patent
 sagarika gandhi se lekar minu masani or america vichaarak thoro se lekar aurangzeb or indira gandhi se lekar nitshe tak sabaki baat karti hai
 As Meenu Masani said, the word Liberal derives from Liberty
 liberty yani aazaadee
 So it is clear that in order to protect freedom it is necessary to have a sense of generosity
 canada party ke netaa monk ko kitaab main uddhrut kiya gaya he ki udaarpanthi loktantric vyavastha ko banaae rakhane kii tulana main chunaav jeetna kam mahatvapurn hota he
 But when winning the election becomes the last truth, rather say that trying to stay in power or to gain power through yen ken, becomes the last destination, then the liberal democratic system in that society has to die
 aaj karnataka se lekar goa tak main jaisaa khel chal rahaa he, usamen vidhayak tak camodity main badal chuke hai, jo kabhi kanoon banane vaale hote the
 So why not assume that the scale of democratic values has changed
 ab hakeekat kii khurduri duniya main nahin, aapako afasaanon main sarkaar le jaaegi
 Later the pole will open but at this time you will roam while singing that come, Hazur, i will take you to the stars
 ek research survey ke jariye se sagarika bataati hai ki unmaad or andhbhakti ke sitaron main jane kii havas aisi he ki bharat main 53 fisadi log sainik shashan ko zyada behatar samajhate hai
 i wish they had read the history of Pakistan after 1947 in the neighborhood, then it would be understandable how ruthless the military dictatorship is and how dangerous for a living society! In fact, the democratic process that has ended in political parties also shows that we do not question the fundamental questions
 aaj desh main koun si party he jo kah sake ki usne aantarik loktantr ko jinda rakhaa he? jis aam aadmi party se logon ne badi aashaaen laga rakhi thi, vah party bhi ek arvind kejariwal kii jubaan kii gulam banakar rakh gai he
 Liberalism also ends those who become liberals of liberal politics
 nahin to kyon jadhavpur uniwarsity ke ek professor ko mamata banerjee kaa cartoon banane par jail kii hawa khaani padati? is adhyay main sagarika gujarat model kii kai kadavi hakikaton ko beparda karti hai jinako jaanakar aap dang rah jaaenge
 In the fourth chapter, Sagarika talks about the moderate opposition, named The Liberal Dissenter
 isamen vah un tamaam sawaalon ko uthaati hai jinamein kisi pansaare, kisi dabholkar ko isliye maar diya jaataa he ki wo karmkand ke thekedaaron kii asaliyat logon ke saamne rakh dete hai
 Sagarika has also explained the references of Swami Vivekananda, how without understanding his values, he has been made the brand ambassador of Hindutva
 vah likhti hai ki dakshinpanthiyon ke liye swami vivekanand rashtravaadi the lekin vamapanthon ke liye sudhaarwadi
 She brings this link of differences to the current government, where the media is called the biggest leader, Bazaru, and then a minister's president
 tukbandi acchhee lagati hogi lekin yah sirf media kii maryaada kaa hi sawaal nahin he balki mahilaon kii maryaada bhi mantri ji kii soch se bandhi he
 Gandhi, who was succeeded by Gandhi as his successor, also had serious differences with Nehru on many issues, but the differences never encroached on the dignity of discrimination
 bharat kii matvirodh kii pahchaan agar mitati he to ham ek loktantric rajya ke rup main ksharan kii disha main badhate hue najar aaenge
 Sagarika has named the fifth chapter The Liberal Woman
 dekha jaae to mahilaayein purushon kaa aakhri upnivesh hai
 In any religious society, the biggest injury to bigotry is on anyone, then they are women
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne beti bachaao beti padhaao kaa naaraa dete hai to acha lagata he lekin betiyon ko bachaane or padhaane ke bare main hamaari udaartaa kaise shunya main villin ho jaati he, yah ek bada prashnchihn hamaare samaaj ke maathe par tanga he
 Now take Rajesh Mishra, the BJP MLA from Bareilly
 unki beti ne ek dalit ladke sang shaadi kar lee
 The girl posted a video from an undisclosed location that she is in danger of life from her MLA father
 ham jis saamaajik parivesh main jite hai, vahaan vot kii raajnneeti hindu banaam musalmaan main samaaj ko baant detii he
 In this, all Hindus are said to be one against Muslims, but as soon as the girl of a Brahmin falls in love with or marries a Dalit boy, all the dignity and unity of Hindutva becomes different
 yahaan dhyaan dena hoga ki ladki yani stri ko kaise hamane izzat ke sawaal se gunth diya he
 Sagarika mentions the events in the book from the ruckus on the film Padmavat to the period of Mahabharata
 mahaan raajnneetik darshanik valtere ne kaha tha ki ho saktaa he ki ham aapke vichaaron se sahamat naa hon phir bhi aapke bolne kii aazaadee kii ham raksha karenge
 This statement of Voltaire itself can be a step towards humanity in the direction of a liberal society
 lekin hindustan kii traasadee yahi rahi ki yahaan satta main aae bahut kam logon ne udaarpanthi soch ko viksit hone diya
 This book by Sagarika has given a new vision to understand India in a modern context
 lekin is kitaab ko or zyada kasi hui banaai ja saktaa tha
 The burden of examples and references is slightly increased
 is drushtikon se yah kitaab aam pathak se zyada research scoleron ke liye zyada mahatvapurn he
 The book is in English, but to reach the common man, it is necessary to get it translated into Hindi

 He said, 'I was and always will be in Amritsar

 bharat or newzealand ke bich guuruuvaar se shuru hone ja rahi series kaa pehla test match hyderabad main khelaa jayega, or pichley 16 saal main yah pehla mauka hoga, jab team india se rahul dravid or vivies lakshmana, donon hi nadaarad honge
 
 
 After the retirement of VVS 'very Very Special' Laxman, the excitement of this first match to be held in Hyderabad of the series of two matches has been very less
 
 
 hyderabad cricket sangh ke adhikariyon ke mutabik local hero lakshmana ke team main na hone se tikaton kii bikri par bhi khaasaa asar padaa he
 
 
 However, in the first Test match of the series, both teams try to make a new start
 
 
 van−de international cricket main bhale hi team india form main ho, lekin test format main mahendra singh dhoni kii aguai vaali is team ko khoi hui saakh waapas paane ke liye edi-chotii kaa jor lagaana hoga
 
 
 This time, even though it is against New Zealand, Team India will have to forget the defeats at the hands of England and Australia and start with the win, so that morale remains high
 
 
 vahiin, mehmaan newzealand kii team bhi west indies ke haathon mili karaari haar ko bhulaakar bharat main nai shuruyaat karnaa chaahegi
 
 
 However, if we talk about the last 10 Test matches, both the teams will have to improve their form a lot
 
 
 bharat ne apane pichley 10 test maichon main se sirf do jite hai, jabaki ek ko drow karne main kaamyaab rahi team india ko saat maichon main shikast kaa saamana karnaa padaa, jabaki newzealand ne apane pichley 10 muqablon main se chaar match haare hai, teen main jeet hasil kii he, or teen hi drow rahe hai
 
 
 In the coming days, India has to play its next 10 Test matches on its own land and history is witness that defeating India in India is not an easy task
 
 
 bharat main newzealand ke pichley record ko dekhen to pichley 24 saalon se kiwi team bharat main koi test nahin jeet saki he
 
 
 Looking at the current form of both teams, the Kiwi team lacks experienced batsmen
 
 
 brandan makkulam, ross tailor or martin guptil ko chhodkar koi bhi ballebaaz bhartiya pichon par tikne kaa madda nahin rakhata
 
 
 On the other hand, New Zealand's bowling may also prove to be weak in the absence of Daniel Vettori on India's spinning track
 
 
 tippaniyan By the way, Team India looks stronger than Ross Taylor's team
 
 
 rahul dravid or vivies lakshmana ke na hone se team kaa middle order kuch kamazor zarur hua he, lekin phans ko bharosa he ki mahendra singh dhoni kii team is chunauti se zarur paar paa legi
 
 
 There is nothing more worrying for Team India at the moment in bowling, as Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma are returning to fit fully
 
 
 aise main hyderabad kii wicket par in donon se kamaal kii ummid kii ja sakati he
 
 
 According to the pitch curator of the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium in Hyderabad, the pitch will help both fast and spin bowlers in the first Test match and the result of the match will definitely come out
 
 
 baharhaal, series ke pehle test match main donon hi tiimon kii koshish nai shuruyaat karne kii he
 
 
 In one-day International cricket, even though Team India is in form, in the Test format, this team, led by Mahendra Singh Dhoni, will have to make a lot of effort to get back the lost credibility
 
 
 is baar muqabla bhale hi newzealand se he, lekin team india ko england or australia ke haathon mili haar ko bhulaakar aage badhanaa hoga or jeet se shuruyaat kerani hogi, taaki manobal ooncha bana rahe
 
 
 At the same time, the visiting New Zealand team will also want to forget the crushing defeat at the hands of the West Indies and make a fresh start in India
 
 
 vaise agar pichley 10 test maichon kii baat karen to donon tiimon ko apni form main kaaphi sudhaar karnaa hoga
 
 
 India have won just two of their last 10 Tests, while Team India, which managed to draw one, lost seven matches, while New Zealand lost four of their last 10 matches, three
 Won, and only three draws
 
 
 aane vaale dinon main bharat ko apane agle 10 test match apni hi zamin par khilne hai or itihaas gavaah he ki bharat ko bharat main haraana aasaan kaam nahin
 
 
 Looking at the previous record of New Zealand in India, the Kiwi team has not been able to win any Test in India for the last 24 years
 
 
 donon tiimon ke maujuuda form par nazar daalen to kiwi team main anbhavi ballebaazon kii kami he
 
 
 Barring Brandon mccullum, Ross Taylor and Martin Guptill, no batsman has the ability to stick on Indian pitches
 
 
 udhar, bharat ke spinning trek par danniel vettori kii gairmaujuudagi main newzealand kii gendbaazi bhi kamazor sabit ho sakati he
 
 
 The comments vaise ross tailor kii team ke mukaable team india zyada majboot nazar aa rahi he
 
 
 The absence of Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman has made the team's middle order somewhat weak, but the fans are confident that Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team will overcome this challenge
 
 
 gendbaazi main philhal team india ke liye zyada chintajanak kuch nahin he, kyonki zahir khan or ishanth sharma puri tarah feet hokar vaapasi kar rahe hai
 
 
 In such a situation, amazing can be expected from these two on the Hyderabad wicket
 
 
 vaise hyderabad ke rajeev gandhi stadium ke pich curator ke mutabik pehle test match main pich se tej or spin, donon tarah ke gendbaazon ko madad milegi or match kaa nateeja zarur nikalegaa

 During the fifth session of the Panchayat 'jinnah Ek Villain Ka Jung Kaon' organized by Aaj Tak, during the debate on 'who should want Jinnah in Hindustan', Kulkarni said that all our opinion is one that India should not have been divided and There should not have been bloodshed, but it happened
 unhone kaha ki desh ke vibhaajan ke lieginnaase zyada angrej doshi hai
 The British adopted the policy of divide and rule
 unhone kaha ki aazaadee to june 1948 main milane vaali thi, lekin vysarai mountbeton ne isko agast 1987 tak hi khinchaa, jiske kaaran dar kaa maahaul paidaa hua
 During this time he also said that when Mountbatten died in 1979, the Indian government had declared a seven-day mourning and half-tilted the national flag
 jabaki hakeekat yah he ki jinna se zyada ye angrej doshi hai, lekin aaj ham hindu-musalmaan main lard rahe hai

 islamic mulk nahin hoga
 Here Hindus and Muslims will all remain equal
 kulkarni ne kaha, ''adwani ne yah bhi kaha tha ki yah secularism kaa ek model he, to us samay adwani ne sachai hi bataai thi
 Jinnah later said in an interview that India and Pakistan should have relations like the US and Canada
 jinna ne apane pehle hai kamishnar shriprakasha se kaha ki jaakar jawahar laal nehru ko kahie ki main mumbai waapas aakar rahanaa chahta hum
 The house i have built there is to be there
 '' Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, who reached Narmada in Gujarat, addressed the tribal rights public meeting on Monday
 rahul ne gujarat or maharashtra ke sthapana diwas par sabhi ko badhai di
 At the same time, attacking BJP and PM Modi fiercely said that if the Congress comes to power in Gujarat, then everyone will hear the mind
 gujarat kii mahila shakti ko saraahagujarat rajyako desh kii shaan bataate hue congress upaadhyaksh ne kaha, 'gujarat ne hindustan ke liye bahut kuch kiya he
 Some time ago i went to New Zealand and Australia, both countries export milk
 vahaan ke kisaanon ne istemaal ho rahi nai takanic dikhaai, lekin un logon ne kaha ki ve anand or amul kaa muqabla nahin kar sakate kyonki amul ke paas gujarat kii mahila shakti he
 "modiji says what Congress did in 70 years? Congress Vice President said," There used to be a company called Polson Dairy in Gujarat many years ago
 us samay amul nahin tha
 The women of Gujarat used to give milk of their cow to the Polson Company, which did not get the right price
 mahilaon ne jab apni samasya gandhiji se kahi, to unhone sardaar patel ko anand jaakar rahane ko kaha
 Sardar Patel was accompanied by Tribhuvan Patel and then women laid the foundation of Amul
 'badal gaya he gujaratraahul gandhi ne kaha, 'gujarat ke sthapana diwas par rahul gandhi ne kaha ki 70-80 saal purana gujarat, aaj vaisaa nahin he
 One person has not made the progress made in Gujarat
 ye gujarat ke karodon logon ne kiya he, isamen congress kii vichaardhaara bhi shaamil he
 a few years ago, when the farmers' land was being taken away, the farmers told that big industrialists were snatching their land
 'congress ke bill se kisaanon ko hua phaaydarahul gandhi ne kaha, 'congress ne bhoomi adhigrahan kaa nayaa bill pesh kiya, jisase kisaanon ko unki jameen ke achche daam mili
 On this too, BJP and Modiji opposed this bill
 chunaav jeetne par bijepi ne jameen adhigrahan kaa bill radd karne kii koshish kii or adhyadesh bhi laane kaa prayaas hua
 However, when he came to know that the Congress would not back down, Modiji said that he did not want to do this
 'gujarat main chal rahaa he 10-15 logon kaa raajrahul ne aarope lagaaya ki udyogpatiyon ko hajaaron acre kii jameen banti jaati he, agar kisaan apane adhikaron ke liye aawaaj uthaae, to police gharon main unki mahila kii pitayee karti he
 Today Gujarat is ruled by 10-15 people, as the Polson Company used to do
 kuch din pehle patidaar samaaj ke log mere paas aae or kaha ki gujarat main hamaare bacchon ko shiksha nahin milti he
 Congress will show the working, water, forest and land belong to tribals, not to any industrialist
 adivaasiyon ke haq ke liye congress ne kanoon banaaya
 The people of BJP and RSS do not consider tribals as human beings
 gujarat kii janata ne narendra modi par bharosa kiya tha, lekin sachai ye he ki gujarat ke kisaan, chote dukandaar or gujarat main jo shakti hua karti thi us kaa sirf phayda uthaaya gaya
 We do not make big promises, do not do marketing, but we show it by working
 sabaki baat sunegi congress kii sarkalgargujrat main congresski sarkaar aegi, to wo kisi ek party kii sarkaar nahin hogi, wo sabaki sarkaar hogi
 She will not tell anyone about her mind, but will listen to everyone and will talk about your mind
 is chunaav main congress puure dam se ladegi or bijepi ko haraa kar dikhaaegi

 They say that you have to make your strategy such that you can repeat everything before the exam and also make notes so that time can be saved while preparing for the end time
 rohan is baar par bhi kaaphi jor dete he ki hamen smart work karnaa chahie taaki mehnat kaa sahi parinaam mil sake varanaa vaqt or mehnat donon bekaar chali jaati he
 Everyone does hard work, but toppers become those who study smartly
