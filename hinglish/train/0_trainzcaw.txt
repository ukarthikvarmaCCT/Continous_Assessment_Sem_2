 The history of the seat has been dominated by the Mirdha family in Marwar politics in Rajasthan since before independence
 sabase baldevaraam mirdha ne kisaanon ke hiton kii raksha ke liye marwar kisaan sabha sthapana kii
 But the country's first Prime Minister Pt
 jawaharlal nehru se madhyastata ke baad kisaan sabha kaa congress main vilay ho gaya
 After this, Ramdevas Mirdha, son of Baldev Ram Mirdha and Nathuram Mirdha of his own family, dominated the politics here for almost six decades
 lekin dhire-dhire mirdha parivaar kaa asar kam hone laga
 So now the new generation is seen struggling to save its political heritage
 pichley kuch samay se do pramukh dal congress or bijepi ke bich ek nae khilaadi ke taur par hanuman beniwal ubhare hai jo jat yuvaaon ko saath lekar is donon dalon se alag lakeer khichna chaahate hai
 After independence, Congress won the maximum number of 16 general elections and 2 by-elections in Nagaur Lok Sabha seat from 1952 to 2014, 11 times
 1952 main nirdaleey ummidavaar jidi somani jite
 Mathura Das of Congress in 1957, NK Somani of Congress in 1960 by-election and Surendra Kumar Dey of Congress in 1962 were elected from here
 lekin 1967 main congress ke enke somani swatantri party ke tikat par chunaav jeet
 After this, the Mirdha family continued to hold this seat from 1971 to 1997
 1971 main nathuram mirdha yahaan ke saansad chune gaye
 So at the Janata wave of 1977, Nathuram Mirdha managed to save this seat
 1980 main nathuram mirdha congress (you) ke tikat par yahaan ke saansad bane
 An interesting contest was witnessed in this seat in 1984 when Ramdivas Mirdha and Nathuram Mirdha, two strong leaders of the Mirdha family, pitted against each other
 is chunaav main congress ke tikat par ramanivas mirdha ne bhartiya lokdal se ummidavaar nathuram mirdha ko shikast di

 1991 or 1996 ke loksabhaa chunaav main kagress ke tikat par nathuram mirdha kaa is seat par kabja rahaa
 But after the death of Nathuram Mirdha, his son Bhanuprakash Mirdha won the seat on the BJP ticket in 1997 bypoll defeating Ram Niwas Mirdha of Congress
 yah pehla mauka tha jab bijepi ne is seat par jeet kaa swaad chakhaa, lekin party ko sahaara mirdha parivaar kaa hi lenaa padaa

 namvar singh kii mrityu unki paripakv aayu or lambii sahitya sadhana ke baavjood dukhad he kyonki vah ek aise samay main hui he jisamen aalochana kii loktantric jagah praayah har kshetra main suniyojit dhang se kam kii ja rahi he
 He continued to write, speak and teach criticism for almost seven decades
 yah ek trygic vidambnaa he ki jis aalochana par unki adig aasthaa thi or jiske ve nirbhik prayokta the, usee aalochana vritti ko unke jivan ke antim charan main har tarah se dabaane or saamaajik vimarsh se baahar karne kaa lagaataar shadyantr ho rahaa he
 Those who do it are those who have been ruling in the democratic system only by using criticism and disagreement
 namvar singh in shaktiyon ke viruddh vaise khadgahast bhale na hue hon jaisi ki unase ummid thi, lekin aalochana ke is hashr se ve baichaiyn jarur the
 Namwar Singh did not consider criticism to be a backward form of composition, nor was his criticism so backward
 ve un thode se aalochakon main se ek the jo aalochana ko rachana kaa sahchar maanate rahe, puure aatmavishvaas or vinay ke saath
 Scholars, studies, research, delicacy, ideas, etc
 were named by Namvar Ji with extraordinary talent and ability
 par buniyadi taur par ve aalochak the
 If Hindi literature is to be considered as a kind of pluralistic democracy, then Namvar Singh, for many years, became ruling by playing the role of opposition
 kisi aalochak ko hindi main aisi kendriyata, pratishtha or lokapriyata nahin mili jaisi ki namvar ji ko
 Perhaps there is no other example of a critic's dominance in an Indian language
 ramchandra shukla, hajaari prasad dvivedi, ramvilas sharma sambhawatah namvar ji se bade or vijayadev narayan saahi unke samakaksh aalochak rahe hai par unamem se kisi ne aisi jagah or prabhaav apni aalochana se arjeet nahin kiya jaisaa namvar ji ne
 In a literary landscape where creation itself has been central, criticism has come to the center, without overthrowing, and creating a kind of polycentricity is an unexpected event
 sahitya kii saamaajikta or samaaj ko sahitya kii aavashyaktaa par namvar ji kaa vishesh aagrah tha
 He considered literature as a social institution
 unase kai baar ise lekar asahmati hoti thi lekin ve sahitya main hone vaale parivartanon ko saamaajik-rajnatik parivartanon se jodakar dikhaane kii adbhut kshamta rakhte the
 He repeatedly kept telling the Hindi society that literature is needed to understand and deal with the changes
 lambey samay shikshak rahe namvar singh ne apane samay or samaaj main lokshikshak kii bhoomika bhi nibhaaih is had tak ki unhone likhaa kam, bolaa adhik
 His eloquence emerged as a paradigm of public oratory
 unhen jitne logon ne gaur se padhaa hoga, usase kai guna logon ne gaur se suna hoga
 It can be said that in our time and society, he started and established a public oratory tradition of criticism
 ve hindi ke durlabh saarvajanik buddhijivi the
 Namvar ji was a multifaceted person of his time and his interest and penetration was deep in tradition, history, culture, philosophy, thought, Marxism, modernism and postmodernism, besides literature
 par is vishaal or gahari vidwata ko namvar ji ne apane likhe-kahe par yaa apane or dusron par kabhi boj nahin banane diya
 He could unexpectedly explain a contemporary work or practice by associating it with a verse of Prakrit or by a statement by Walter Benjamin
 hindi main aisa or koi nahin he jo itani sahajata or aatmavishvaas se pracheenon, madhyakalinon, aadhunikon or uttar-aadhunikon se bauddhik gap laga saktaa ho
 Namvar Singh, who considers himself a warrior of Marxist ideology, did not always like to flow in the stream with bigotry
 ek sajag aalochak kii tarah ve usase jab-tab, avasarvadita kaa aarope lagane kaa jokhim uthaakar, vichlit ho jate the
 In their deep interest and vision, there were duality and they often bowed in favor of their vision instead of their interest
 par isamen andeh nahin ki unki pustak-paki ankhon ko eemaandaar parakh karne main chook karte kam hi paaya gaya
 It is also noteworthy that Namvar ji continuously tried to make the language of Hindi criticism free from academic acrimony and communicable
 swayan apni vidwata kaa boj unhone us par kabhi nahin daalaa jabaki vah gahari or pramanik thi
 Namvar Singh became a paradigm as a Hindi teacher: influential and suggestive teachers like him have been rare
 rasikata, vidwata or samvednaa kaa jo vitan namvar ji bunate the vah unke chaatro ko behad prabhavit or abhibhoot karata tha
 He was also instrumental in making the university-level Hindi curriculum more relevant
 unke anek chaatr aaj desh bhar main adhyaapan kar rahe hai or unka kuch uttaradhikaar unamem bachaa hoga, aisi ukvamid kii ja sakati he
 Namwar Singh had faith in the younger generation, at times seeming irrational, and because of this he did not hesitate to exaggerate about the young works and writers
 agar aalochak kaa naitik kartavya aakhri dam tak nae se nae ko padhuya-gunana he to namvar ji se behatar is kartavya kaa paalan kisi or ne shaayad nahin kiya
 The demise of Namvar ji ends the era of criticism and critique in Hindi: perhaps even of idiocy
 ab ham phir ausat par waapas chale jaaenge
 *** nagpur or sikanderabad ke bich 571 kilometre kii rail line par 200 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar se train chalaane ke bharat ke sapane ko puraa karne ke liye rus kii export team ne praarambhik adhyayan ke baad suzav die hai
 Russia has recommended 2 meters high fencing of this railway line to build high speed corridors
 rail line ke neeche kii jameen ko 40 centimetre moti kancreet kii chadar se dhakne kii bhi jarurat bataai gai he
 With all such suggestions, the technical delegation of Russia introduced top officials of the Railway Board from their preliminary study inside the Rail Bhavan in the capital Delhi
 rus se aae pratinidhimandal ne apni yojana railway ke saamne rakhi
 In their presentation, Russian experts said that the entire railway line between Nagpur and Secunderabad needed a complete overhaul
 is railway line ko 200 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar se train chalaane ke liye kai chizon main parivartan jaruri he
 According to him, it has been found in preliminary studies that the communication technology here also needs to be made the latest
 iske alaava is line par trection line ko jarurat ke mutabik aadhunik karnaa aavashyak he
 In order to not move the land under the railway line at high speed, it is necessary in many places that the soil under the tracks be changed
 nagpur-sikanderabadke bich kai railway pul he or isi ke saath jagah jagah par choti choti puliya he in sab kii takat ko parakhane ke liye detail study kii jarurat roosi pratinidhimandal ne bataai
 Significantly, on 15 October last year, India's old friend Russia has given the assurance of helping Indian Railways increase its speed

 Russia will provide technical advice to India in this matter as well as in the High Speed corridor between Nagpur and Secunderabad, the Russian Railways agreed to a fifty-fifty partnership with Indian Railways
 iske liye rus bharat kii vittiya madad bhi karegaa
 Russia had pledged technical cooperation to India during December 2015, for which an mou was signed between the two countries
 samjhauta gyaapan main aapasi sahyog ke kai kshetron kii pahchaan kii gai thi rus main bharat main hai speed rail main sahyog dene kaa vaayada kiya tha
 Along with this, modernization of the existing lines of Indian Railways was also promised to increase the speed of the railways from 107 to 200 kilometers per hour
russia has completed the Indian Railways in terms of modern control and security related systems based on satellite navigation and digital communication mediums
 Was asked to cooperate
 iske alaava bharat or rus ke bich main rolling stock ko lekar takneekee sahyog kii sahmati bhi bani thi donon deshon ne parivahan suraksha or sibar suraksha ke saath-saath steshnon kaa punarvikas karne kii baat bhi kahi thi
 Russia has the experience of running the world's longest rail line, the Trans Siberian Railway
 trans siberian railway aisi jagahon se hokar guzarati he jo biabaan he or bhugolic drushti se kaaphi kathin he aise main is railway ko duniya kaa aashcharya hi mana jaataa he rus ke paas tamaam takneekee jaankariyaan hai jinako vah bhartiya railway ke saath saajha kar saktaa he
 With this, on the one hand, Indian Railways will be able to get technology at a cheaper price, on the other hand, a big market to India's friendly country Russia
 is tarah donon hi deshon ke liye yah sahyog munaafe kaa sauda hoga
 Global rating agency Fitch Ratings says that the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India will support productivity (productivity) and will benefit in the economy after a long period
 fich ke mutabik jiesti se dirghakaalik vruddhi kii sambhaavna badhegi lekin nikat bhavishya main kar rajasav badhane kii sambhaavna nahin he
 The GST, which heralds a taxation system, was implemented on July, with four levels of tax
 haalanki dirghakaal main paroksh rup se rajasav ko badhaava milegaa kyonki yah jidipi vruddhi ko sahyog karata he tathaa kar anupaalan ko badhaava detaa he
 Unlike his rival Moody's, Fitch is silent on the impact of this new tax system on the country's financial standing
 gauratlab he ki mudies ne pichley ravivaar ko kaha tha ki nayi kar vyavastha jidipi main teji laaegaa tathaa yah kadam bharat kii vittiya saakh ke liye sakaaratmak sabit hoga
 According to Fitch, the advantage of GST is that retailers have to show compliance in the supply chain to claim refunds

 The central government has decided to implement GST across the country from 1 July

 On the other hand, sources in Raj Bhavan say that no RJD leader came to Raj Bhavan at the scheduled time
 lekin nishchit rup se rajd kii koshish he ki bhale sibiai jaanch chal rahi ho lekin srijan ghotaale ke mudde ko banaae rakhaa jaye
 Party leaders believe that even on such a subject, such a party was aggressive in opposition like BJP, it has not been able to show such attitude

 Let us tell you that on Saturday, Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) formed an alliance in Uttar Pradesh
 is dauraan donon partiyon ke bich saal 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main seat shering ko lekar samjhauta hua
 Both parties decided to contest 38-38 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh
 iske alaava amethi or raibareli siton samet 4 siton ko choda gaya he
 It is being told that two seats have been left for former Union Minister Ajit Singh's party Rashtriya Lok Dal (rashtriya Lok Dal)
 is gathbandhan se congress ke saath hi shivpal yadav kii pragatisheel samaajawaadee party (lohia) ko bhi baahar rakhaa gaya he
 On Saturday, when Shivpal Yadav was questioned about the SP-BSP alliance, he said that this alliance is incomplete without the Progressive Samajwadi Party
 chunaav main bijepi ko sirf secular front hi maat de saktaa he
 If we talk about the last Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections, both SP and BSP had to face a crushing defeat
 saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne uttar pradesh kii 80 siton main 71 siton par jeet darj kii thi or endie main bijepi kii sahyogi apana dal ko 2 siton par jeet mili thi
 Let me tell you that recently, Shivpal Yadav split from the Samajwadi Party and formed the Progressive Samajwadi Party (lohia)
 iske baad unhone soobe main bijepi ko haraane ke liye secular front banane kaa bhi elaan kiya tha
 Mayawati had pinned on Shivpal during the press conference, during the announcement of an alliance between the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party on May 24, Mayawati quipped on the Progressive Samajwadi Party (lohia) Chief Shivpal Yadav, on which Akhilesh Yadav could also stop his laughter
 shivpal yadav kaa zikr karte hue mayawati ne kaha tha, 'hamaare gathbandhan se darkar bhartiya janata party akhilesh yadav kaa naam khanan ghotaale main ghaseet rahi he or kendriya jaanch agency (sibiai) kaa durupyog kar rahi he
 This has strengthened the SP-BSP alliance rather than weakening it
 ab bijepi kaa shivpal yadav par pani kii tarah bahaya gaya paisa bhi bekaar chalaa jayega
 BSP supremo Mayawati said, 'the candidates of UP, who have been formed by the BJP and the organization of Muslims, Dalits and backward, including Shivpal Yadav's Progressive Samajwadi Party (lohia), run by BJP from behind the scenes and the people of UP
 Will not waste your vote
 soobe kii janata hamaare pavitra or bhaichaare par aadhaarit gathbandhan ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaayegi
 ' pavaar sahab ko aajkal sonia gandhi kii qurbaani yaad aa rahi he
 The same sacrifice that Pawar once separated from the Congress
 lekin ab ensipi adhyaksh sharad pavaar ko lagata he ki pradhanmantri kaa pad thukrakar sonia ne aitihaasik tyaag kiya he or unka virodh karne kaa faisla shaayad sahi nahin tha
 It is said that nothing in politics is old
 kam se kam sonia gandhi kaa pradhanmantri pad ko thukraana to bhartiya raajnneeti kii wo baat he, jise congress kabhi puraani hone bhi nahin dena chaahegi
 But now only those people who have parted from the Congress on the issue of Sonia do not shy away from remembering this political sacrifice of Sonia
 sharad pavaar ko to aap jaanate hi hai
 And they will also know why they formed NCP
 lekin aaj jab wo siyasat ke puraane pannon ko palatate hai, to sonia ke liye shahad bhare bol jubaan se khud hi tapak padate hai
 NCP President Sharad Pawar said, 'we raised that controversy
 par ek baat mujhe manani hogi ki pradhanmantri pad kaa mudda hamane uthaaya tha
 But we later understood that he was getting the post of such a big Prime Minister but he did not accept it, it is Soniaji's greatness
 'satta ke sameekaran hote hi aise hai
 When you are in opposition, protest fiercely and when you get hands, friendship will have to be maintained
 ghadi kii suiyon ke saath pavaar ke badalte tevar or bol to kam se kam isi ore ishaara karte hai

 Yes, we are talking about actor Nana Patekar, known for his strong acting and special dialogue delivery
 haal hi main pakistani kalakaaron parafilm industrimen lagaae gaye bain par jab naanaa patekar se sawaal poocha gaya to unka jawaab kuch yun tha, 'mere liye pakistani kalakaar or baaki sab baad main aate hai, sabase pehle meraa desh he
 Apart from the country, i do not know or want to know anyone

 go to in bharat ke star ballebaaj viraat kohli ko haal main bangladesh ke khilaaf teen maichon kii shrinkhalaa main nahin khilne kaa faisla karne kaa khamiyaja bhugatna padaa he
 He is no longer the number one ODI batsman in the world
 isisi kii taaja vanade ballebaaji ranking main dakshin africa ke abi divilliars sheersh ballebaaj ban gaye hai
 Kohli had a lead of nine rating points over de Villiers but the player has to suffer a loss of one percentage ranking point if his team does not play in any match and thus the Indian batsman has lost 13 points and he is in South Africa
 The player has lost four rating points
 divilliars test ballebaajon kii suchi main bhi sheersh par hai jabaki kohli 10wein sthaan par hai
 However, the ranking may change in the next few months as de Villiers has to play in Sri Lanka and Kohli in England
 bangladesh daure se aaraam lene ke kaaran kohli kii tarah shikhar dhawan or rohit sharma ko bhi nuksaan hua he
 Dhawan is 10th from the loss of two places while Rohit is out of the top 20 at 23rd position

 In the list of ODI bowlers, Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin have lost two places each
 ye donon kramash: saatven or 12wein sthaan par hai

 diwali par khub mithaiyaan bik rahi hai, lekin kahin inamen jehar to nahin
 Yes, such news is going viral on social media, claiming that 67 are being sold in the country
 7 fisadi doodh milavati he
 The reasoning behind this is that milk production in the country is 14 crore and consumption is 64 crore liters, are we and you drinking poison in the name of milk? Are you drinking poisonous milk? Are you considering milk as poison? Milk rivers are flowing in the country without cow and buffalo? We are not raising this question like this only
 iske peeche ye viral video or khabar he jo watsap samet anek soshal media platform par viral ho rahaa he
 Through this video, it is being claimed that much of the milk being sold in the country is mostly fake
 wo doodh nahin he, balki jehar he
 It is written in the headline of this viral news that India drinks poison, not milk
 jabaki viral khabar main daawa kiya gaya he ki he ki desh main jitna bhi doodh bik rahaa he, usamen zyaadaatar nakli he
 It is not milk, but poison
 is viral khabar kii hedline main likhaa he ki doodh nahin jehar peetaa he india
 The viral news claimed that milk production in the country is 140 million liters, but consumption is 64 million liters
 daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki desh main bikne vaala 68
 7% milk and its products are adulterated
 ye food sefti and standard athurity of india kii ore se tay maanakon se mail nahin khaataa
 The WHO has warned that if adulteration is not stopped, 87 percent of Indians may have cancer by 2025
 doodh ke jahrile hone ko lekar viral yah khabar hamaare liye chaunkaane vaali thi
 See the chance of this news going viral
 desh main tyohaar kaa maahaul he, diwali he, is vakt log bade paimaane par ek duusare ko mithai baant kar khushiyaan manaate hai
 In such a situation, it was important for us to know that sweet is not poisonous? We decided to investigate this viral news
 viral khabar main daawa kiya gaya he ki ye jaankaree animal welfare board india ke sadsy mohan singh ahaluwalia ne di he
 We first approached Mohan Singh Ahluwalia
 unase is viral khabar ke bare main baatcheet kii
 Ahluwalia expressed surprise at how such things are being made with milk on such a large scale in the country when there is no such quantity of milk
 ahaluwalia ne saaf kiya ki sarkari agenciyon kii mileebhagat or mafia kii sajeesh ke tahat desh main jahrile doodh kaa kaarobaar ho rahaa he
 But the government will take strict action on this, otherwise people may have to face terrible diseases like cancer in the coming time
 vah jagah-jagah jaakar jahrile doodh ke kaarobaar ko ujagar kar rahe hai
 He claimed that 68 sold in the country
 7 fisadi doodh or usase bana utpaada milavati he yaa jaharila he
 The Ministry of Science and Technology had also confirmed this in the Parliament quoting the survey data of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India 2011
 nakli or jahrile doodh ke viral test main ham jaise jaise aage bad rahe the, ek ke baad ek chaunkaane vaali jaankariyaan hamaare saamne aati ja rahi thim
 In this investigation we met Swami Achuthanand, who fought the battle of fake milk in the Supreme Court
 unhone bataaya ki 2016 main supreme court ne sabhi rajya sarkaron ko mobile lab banaae jane, nakli doodh ke maamalon main faisla jaldi karte hue jurmaana lagane ke aadesh die the
 In this investigation, an advisory by Joint Director Daya Shankar was put on our website of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)
 isamen unhone saaf likhaa he ki doodh or doodh utpaadon kii maang aapurti se baahar hone par tyohaar ke mausam main aksar milawat ke maamle bad jate hai
 What is added to milk is also mentioned in this letter
 doodh mafia doodh kii maatra badhaane ke liye pani milaate hai
 Apart from this, urea, skimmed milk powder are also used
 nakli doodh banane main disergent powder, sabun, synthetic doodh kaa bhi istemaal hota he
 Vegetable oil and fat are used to show fat in milk
 doodh ko fatne se bachaane ke liye hypochlorides, chloramins, hydrogen paraoxide, boric acid kaa istemaal hota he
 Harmful chemicals are also used in making curd, cheese, butter and cream
 tamaam chemical se bana ye nakli doodh sehat ke liye kitna hanikaarak hota he, ise lekar hamane varisht neutrician dow
 Talked to Manjari Chandra
 unhone bataaya ki doodh main chemical kii maatra zyada hone par nuksaandaayak hota he
 If we drink milk with chemical in this way, then there can be diseases like neuro, mental illness, lack of development and cancer in children
 hamaari padtaal ab puri ho chuki thi
 The claim of this viral news was confirmed in the investigation
 lihaaja doodh nahin jehar peetaa he india vaali ye khabar hamaare viral test main paas ho gai

 After this, the district administration started the paperwork to demolish this bungalow

 The bill, which declared three divorces as punishment, was introduced in the Rajya Sabha today
 haalanki vipaksh kii use select cameti ko bhejne kii maang or sarkaar ke isse inkaar se aisa hangaamaa hua ki upasabhapati ne sadan kii kaarywahi puure din ke liye sthagit kar di
 Now both sides are questioning each other's intentions and are giving clarification about their side
 rajyasabha main pesh hua biltin talaak bill shuukravaar ko loksabhaa main takreeban sarvasahmati se paas ho gaya
 Just five hours of debate and without any amendment, this bill was passed by all parties including BJP and Congress
 bill ke liye aavashyak he ki ye rajyasabha se bhi paas ho taaki raashtrapati ke hastakshar ke baad ise kanoon banaaya ja sake
 Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad introduced the bill in the Rajya Sabha today but the opposition almost unanimously demanded to send it to the standing committee
 vipaksh ke rukh se baikfoot par ai sarkaarcongress sahit baaki vipaksh ke is bill ko select cameti main bhejne se sarkaar hairaan thi
 The government argued that the parties, including the Congress, who passed the bill without any difficulty in the Lok Sabha, could come to the Rajya Sabha with a changed stand
 duusari ore vipaksh kaa tark tha ki sadan kii apni ek prakriya he or wo usee kaa paalan kar rahi hai
 The demand to send the bill to the Select Committee is legitimate and necessary
 jetali ne diya 6 maheene kaa tarksarkaar kii ore se vitt mantri arun jetali ne bill ko select cameti main bhejne kaa virodh kiya or kaha ki supreme court ne jab teen talaak ko avaidh qaraar diya tha, tab chah maheene ke bheetar kanoon banane ko kaha tha
 Those six months are being completed on 22 February, so the House should pass the bill immediately
 duusari ore congress netaa anand sharma kaa kahana tha ki 22 farvari main abhi vakt he
 The budget session will start at the end of this month, till then the select committee should consider the bill and give it a strong law so that the bill can be removed
 congress netaa kapil sibbal ne kaha ki court ne jab chah maheene kaa samay diya tha tab ye bhi kaha tha ki ye maheene tab puure honge jab kanoon ban jayega
 In this way, the government cannot make haste by making excuse of time
 vipaksh ne rakhe sanshodhan, chair ne bataae-vaidharajyasabha main bill pesh hone ke baad vipaksh kii ore se do sanshodhan pesh kiye gaye
 Jaitley opposed these amendments by saying that the Congress was not following the convention and the amendment required to be given 24 hours in advance, but after a heated debate, Deputy Chairman PJ Kurien accepted the amendments as valid
 iske baad vipakshi sadsy in sanshodhano par voting kii maang karne lage lekin satta paksh kii ore se kuch sadsy hangaamaa karne lage
 The Chair then adjourned the proceedings of the House for the whole day
 congress kii ranneetisadan kii kaarywahi ke baad congress kii ore se ranjit ranjan ne kaha ki ye sajeesh he
 The BJP wants to keep the triple talaq issue alive till the Karnataka elections
 vipaksh divijan kii maang kar rahaa tha lekin sarkaar rajyasabha sthagit karne par ad gai
 The Congress claims that only the BJP and Shiromani Akali Dal were in support of the bill
 sarkaar kii sahyogi shivasena bhi iske virodh main thi
 17 parties wanted to send this bill to the Select Committee
 sarkaar ne darkar voting hone hi nahin di
 By doing this, the Congress has tried to convey this message among the Muslims that it has not stopped fighting over their interests
 bijepi kii ranneetisarkaar kisi bhi rup main teen talaak par khud ko sadan main alpamat main nahin dikhaanaa chaahati
 Had it been voting and the amendment was approved, it would have been gritty because its allies were against the bill
 aise main usne voting na hone dene kaa rasta chunaa
 The BJP will now attack the opposition, especially the Congress, on triple talaq outside the house, that it did not allow the triple talaq bill to be passed and strengthened the Muslim fundamentalists' favor in place of Muslim women

 unki tasviren akhbaaron kii surkhiyaan baniin, lekin barbaad fasalon kaa na to koi muawza mila or na hi qarz maafi kaa bharosa
 Kulwinder Singh, the son of the deceased farmer told that no government minister nor any officer, he is taking out the city kirtan, he has no time to take care of the farmer
 surajeet ke parivaar ko malaal he ki sarkaar kaa koi numaayinda unka haal poochne nahin aayaa
 By the way, Badal government does not have free time these days

 His pictures made newspaper headlines, but neither was any compensation for the wasted crops nor the confidence of loan pardon

 Today, i got a call from Bandanwaz Seculardas- Meet soon
 kabhi is tarah se unhone sidhe phone nahin kiya tha
 He was assisted by them and after some waiting, they came on the line
 main tej kadamon se nazar bachaate unke saamne haazir hua
 They were being battered by anger and anxiety
 mudda tha-agra main dharmantaranse musalmaan hue logon kaa waapas hindu hona
 Said, 'you say conversion is non-violent, then why all this !? Here the condition of Seculardas was more important than ideology
 so maine kaha: koi nahin, hinduon ke jaatpant se paala padegaa to phir se musalmaan ban jaaenge
 On this he went to bifurcation - Oh, even among Muslims, Jatanthan is no less
 mujhe nahin lagata ve waapas musalmaan banenge
 What should be done now
 secularadaas bade nirih se apane haathon main sar liye mere saamne the or main kuch bhi kehane ke liye bebas
 Then an idea came - Chachu, Congress will return in the next election
 phir ye log dubaara islam kabool kar lenge
 On hearing this, his eyes were deceived
 kehane lage- dekho meraa man rakhane ke liye tum jhooth par jhooth bole ja rahe ho
 Congress is the plane whose pilot is Pappu and due to Modyandhi the political season is totally unfavorable
 ye udana dur, techoff bhi nahin kar paaegaa
 Where was i as well? so antim astr chalaane kaa lobh roak nahin paaya-'aap' dhire-dhire congress kii jagah le legi
 The late secular-leftists will also come here to settle the contract
 ho saktaa he dilli main dobaaraa unki sarkaar bhi ban jaae
 What troubles you? Seculardas became serious this time
 bole- aap us premi kii tarah he jise premika kaa itnaa pyaar or vishwaas mila ki wo narbhasia gaya or akaaran uski aisi taisi par utar aayaa
 When he came to his senses, he had a girlfriend, he also had a love, but faith had become evident
 aapke kehane kaa matlab? maine sanjeeda hote hue poocha
 Seculardas started speaking in a very simple way - Brother topped the AAP government
 agar ban bhi gai to is baar aamokhas kii seva main aise duubegi ki secular-communal or hindu-muslim ke liye kisi ke paas fursat na hogi
 'then it will be a very good thing', i added intermittently
 ve phir bole -dekho, tumlog hamen kya samajhoge
 We got a job riding on the chariot of secular-communal
 is-us party ke logon ke chakkar laga satta ke kareeb ho liye
 Without any work, his coin froze
 lekin isi bich internet-mobile-anna-aap or modi ne aakar kaam bigaad diya
 These are all going to work and we are not used to work
 main munh baae unako sun rahaa tha
 He kept speaking non-stop - we were dreaming of retiring on the basis of secular-communal and hindu-muslim
 hamen kya nahin maaloom ki bharat yaa koi bhi desh apane bahumat kii badaulat acha yaa bura banataa he
 Today, the role of Hindus is big in whatever is good
 kashmir to musalmaan bahul he
 What happened there? Inside Pakistan has become an export hub for infighting
 ekaek unka dhyaan ghadi kii ore gaya
 It was nine in the night
 bole-aaj main tumhen rukne ke liye bhi nahin kah saktaa
 Both comrades are going to gym here
 koi america se konyak kii do bottlen lete aayaa tha
 And yes, i do come once in a while
 tumhaara jhooth tumhaare sachmuch ke saarvajanik tante se kahin sukun denevaala he
 i quipped - anyone saw me here? Bandanwaz Seculardas smiled this time in the superiors - Hey, no one
 main to lenin kii line follow kar rahaa tha: ek kadam peeche, do kadam aage

 ) According to political observers, in the politics of Uttar Pradesh, which is usually controlled by ethnicity, Muslims are mainly considered as the traditional vote bank of the SP, but in their manifesto released for the 2012 assembly elections, the promises made to the Muslims are not implemented
 And recently there has been signs of disenchantment of Muslim voters with this party due to the ruckus in the 'socialist family'

 Political experts believe that if the grand alliance of secular parties in Uttar Pradesh is formed on the lines of Bihar, the Muslim vote bank may remain united, but the SP chief has categorically denied any alliance

 Vodafone Idea and Airtel announced to increase their tariff from December 1, before Jio started taking money for non-jio calling
 Due to adjusted gross revenue (AGR), companies are incurring huge losses
 Has announced to increase the tariff
 haal hi main reliance jeeyo ne interconect yujar charge (IUC) kaa hawala dete hue non jeeyo colling ke liye paise lene shuru kiye hai
 Problems like Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) are causing huge losses to all telecom companies
 vodaphone idia ko to bhartiya corporate itihaas kaa sabase bada ghaataa hua he
 Therefore, at present, companies are trying to increase their income to some extent by increasing tariffs
 haalanki, jeeyo kaa tarriff ab bhi baaki companiyon ke mukaable kaaphi kam he, aise main duusari telecom companiyaan dodhari talwaar par chal rahi hai
 The reason for this is that by increasing the tariff, their customers can break down and go towards Jio
 jeeyo ke aane ke badawaise hi airtel or vodaphone idia kii haalat kaaphi kharaab he, kyonki badi sankhya main inke graahak jeeyo kii ore ja chuke hai
 Telecom companies on the verge of ruin In fact, many of India's telecom companies have reached the verge of ruin due to the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) charged by the government
 telecom company Vodafone Idea ko duusari timahi main ab tak kaa sabase bada 50,921 karod kaa ghaataa hua he
 This is the biggest loss in Indian corporate history
 airtel ko bhi july-sitambar, 2019 timahi main 23,045 karod rupee kaa bada ghaataa hua he
 Adjusted gross revenue is charged by the government and due to this, the burden on these companies has increased considerably
 supreme court ne 24 oktober 2019 ko die apane faisle main telecom department ko telecom companiyon se kareeb 94000 karod rupee bataur AGR vasuulne kii ijaajat de di he
 However, if you add interest and penalty, then these 1
 3 lakh karod rupee hota he
 Vodafone Idea said in its statement that the increase in tariff has become a compulsion due to the difficulty of the telecom sector
 company ne kaha he ki telecom sector main pareshaani he usase sabhi stekholders sahamat hai
 What happens AGR Adjusted gross revenue (AGR) is the usage and licensing fees charged by telecom companies by the Department of Telecommunications (dot) in the Ministry of Communications
 iske do hisse hote hai- spectrum ujes charge or licencing fees, jo kramash 3-5 fisadi or 8 fisadi hota he
 The Department of Telecommunications states that AGR should be calculated based on the total revenue or revenue of a telecom company, including income from non-telecom sources such as deposit interest and asset sales
 duusari taraf, telecom companiyon kaa kahana he ki AGR kii gananaa sirf telecom sevaaon se hone vaali aay ke aadhaar par honi chahie
 The Supreme Court also upheld the stand of the Department of Telecommunications in its order dated October 24, 2019
 airtel or vodaphone-idia par sabase zyada bonneretel ko iske tahat 43,000 karod rupee or vodaphone idia ko 40,000 karod rupee dene honge
 The last date for this is 24 January
 desh main jeeyo kii chunauti or anya kai vajahon se pehle se hi kai telecom companiyon kii haalat kharaab thi, aise main supreme court kaa nirnay unke liye bada jhatka sabit hua he
 Especially telecom companies vodafone-idea Ltd and Airtel have incurred huge losses due to AGR
 kyon ho rahaa ghatghate kii badi vajah yah he ki companiyon ko agiaar ke liye provijaning kerani pad rahi he yani ek tay raashi alag rakhni pad rahi he

 november 2012 main hui nilaamee ke liye jo arakshit mulya rakhaa gaya tha, uske mukaable yah 30 pratishat kam hoga

 This is based on the price cut for GSM spectrum at 1800 mhz
 ek sutara ne bataaya, ‘chunki sidime praudyogiki ko lene vaale kuch hi companiyaan hai, at: ijioem kaa maananaa he ki ucch mulya par koi bolidaata nahin aaenge, isiilie samooh arakshit mulya main 50 pratishat katautee kii sifarish karegaa

 He said that in the 900 mhz band, 15-15 mhz spectrum would be offered for sale in Delhi and Mumbai and 12 in Kolkata
 5 megahatrj hoga
 In Karnataka and Rajasthan it will be 10 mhz
 sarkaar pichley saal november main hui sidime spectrum kii nilaamee karne main vifal rahi
 Due to the high reserve price, no one came forward to bid for it

 The death of three starving girls in East Delhi has once again shocked the nation
 bilkul vaise hi jaise jharkhand main sintabar, 2017 main 11 saal kii santoshi kii maut or isi saal june main 58 saal kii savitri devi kii maut se desh main hadakamp much gaya tha
 But there are many more such deaths which are not even mentioned
 aisa hi kissabnaraski musaharon kii basti kaa he, jahaan ek hi parivaar main saat mautein huin lekin unka zikr kuchhek local akhabaaron ke alaava kahin nahin hualoksabhaa chunaav kawarej ke dauraan banaras kii sewapuri vidhansabha seat ke gaanv mehndiganj main musaharon kii basti ke kuch logon ne april 2014 ko yah khabar di thi, 'yah saamne ghar dekh rahi hai, pichley saal hi yahaan puraa parivaar bhukh se mar gaya
 Four children, parents and an old man
 'mere liye 'bhukh se maut' kii khabar dil dahala dene vaali thi
 Can the news of hunger deaths in 2014 be normal news? This was probably the first time i had heard of hunger deaths after the famine in Kala Handi
 haalanki is khabar kii pushti nahin ho pai
 From the Anganwadi to the BDO, the DM to the MLA of the district made the most inquiries but no one confessed that the cause of these seven deaths was hunger
 ainam ne itnaa jarur kaha, bacchon main 'kuposhan' jarur tha, magar is str par nahin tha ki unki maut ho jaae
 This answer was pointing to hunger
 lekin technikali isse 'bhukh se maut' hone kii baat sabit nahin hoti
 The people of the township told that both the parents used to work in brick kilns
 lekin donon lambey samay se biimaar the
 Therefore, the family did not have the means of earning
 basti ke logon ne kai dinon tak madad kii lekin koi kab tak madad karata?maut kis din hui thi yah thik-thik kisi ko nahin pataa tha
 Some houses in this slum did not have ration cards and in the houses where the kotedar used to give ration to them and never
 kathith taur par jis parivaar ke logon ke bare main bhukh se maut hone kii khabar basti ke logon ne di unke paas rashan card nahin tha
 The people of the township told that after this accident, for the first time there was a gathering of big officials
 basti main mushkil se 20-22 ghar the
 By April 2014 neither road nor electricity was reached in that settlement
 basti ke logon ne bataaya, ''ainam or aashaa yahaan kabhi-kabhaar hi aati hai
 The fate of this settlement can be gauged from the fact that on one side there was a completely adjacent Muslim settlement and on the one side there was a settlement of Brahmins
 donon bastiyon main sadak bhi thi or bijli bhi
 But this settlement was away from government services
 jahaan tak poochtacha ho sakati thi, poochtacha kii
 When no clue was found, this news was left in the middle
 local akhabaaron main bhi yah khabar saat logon kii maut ke rup main hi chhapi thi
 Nobody investigated these deaths in depth
 musaharon kii basti main hue is haadase kii yaad mujhe pehali baar sitambar 2017 jharkhand ke simdega main 11 saal kii bacchee kii bhukh se hui maut ke vakt ai
 Then came the death of 58-year-old Savitri Devi of starvation in Mangaragadi village of Giridih district in Jharkhand this year
 or khud ko kai baar kosa ki aakhir maine us khabar kii padtaal or gaharaai tak jaakar kyon nahin kii thi? vajah shaayad meraa chunavi kawarej ke target ko puraa karnaa tha
 Well, now we mention the news which has been very disturbed from the local to the national media
 jharkhand main hui savitri devi kii maut ke bare main gaanv waalon kaa kahana tha ki unka rashan card 'aadhaar' se link na na hone kii vajah se radd ho gaya tha
 He was not getting ration since then
 lekin prashasan ne is maut ke peeche beemaari bataai or sabit bhi kiya
 The reason for Santoshi's death was also the Aadhar card not being linked to the ration card
 santoshi ke gharavaalon ko bhi rashan nahin mil rahaa tha
 Her mother told many journalists how her daughter died saying 'bhat-bhat'
 hakeekat to yah he ki gaiyrsarkari sanghathan ho, vipaksh yaa media teenon hi tabhi jaagate hai jab khabar satta paksh or vipaksh ke bich hangaamaa khadaa kar sake yaa sansani ban sake
 If there was no opposition to making Aadhaar necessary, then starvation deaths in Jharkhand would not have come to the fore
 yah mudda bhi shaayad banaras ke musaharon kii maut kii tarah bina padtaal gum ho jaataa
 There is a possibility of the issue of death of three girls in East Delhi becoming bigger because firstly the issue is about the capital
 Secondly, the way it was connected to the plan to distribute ration to the house from the ruling party, it seems, on the death of the girls There will be more commotion now
 haalanki dilli ke upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne pehle pallaa jhaadne kii koshish yah kehete hue kii, kii bacchon ne ek din pehle khaanaa khaaya tha, phir bhukh se maut kaise ho sakati he?lekin baad main medical report main aae tathyon ko unhen sweekaar karnaa padaa
 Meanwhile, AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj seized the issue and linked it to the LG vs Kejriwal controversy
 unhone baton hi baton main ishaara kar diya ki ghar-ghar tak rashan pahunchane kii yojana hoti to aisa nahin hota
 And everyone knows that LG was opposing this plan
 bhaajapa ke manoj tiwari or congress ke ajay maakan ne bhi ise sarkaar kii hilaahvaali se jod diya
 That is, the state has changed but not the character of politics
 jharkhand se lekar dilli tak bhukh se hone vaali mauton par siyasat bilkul ek tarah kii
 The system reverberates, says Jyoti Mathur, director of the Failakailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation, "there are child safety committees at every district, even at the block and village level
" in samitiyon kaa kaam hota he, kshetra ke bacchon ke bare kii masping karnaa
 Monitoring all aspects related to their security
 kul milakar bacchon ke bare main padhai-likhaai, swasthya se judi har jaankaree jutanaa in samitiyon kaa kaam hota he
 This committee works under the Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS)
 ''sarkaar or civil sosayadi kii partnship se yah skim chalati he
 She also points out that the death of three girls reflects the failure of the child protection system
 yani yahaan system phir fail ho gaya
 Apart from these committees, the question also arises as to where are the Anganwadis of that area? Where are the Annapurna Yojana of Delhi Government and its kitchen scheme started at the time of Sheila Dixit? How hungry India is in the world? Now also see that in the world What is our position on 'hunger'? According to the Global Hunger Index 2017, India is ranked 100 out of 119 countries
 2016 main yah rank 97 thi
 That is, in one year we slipped down three ranks
 is maamle main ham jibooti or rwanda jaise deshon ke aasapaas hai
 According to the report, one in every three children under the age of five is underweight, they are underweight
 yani 37
 5 percent of children are underweight
 teen main se ek baccha chote kad kaa he
 That is 38
 4 fisadi bacchon kaa kad saamaanya bacchon ke kad se kam he
 21 percent of children are very weak
 yah saare aankade kuposhan or uske prakaar ko darshaate hai
 The rank of Pakistan and Afghanistan is slightly worse than us, but the rank of Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh is much better than us
 nepal kii rank 72, srilanka kii rank, 84 or bangladesh kii rank 88 he
 While Pakistan is ranked 106 and Afghanistan is 107

 thakare ne apane bayaan main agle aam chunaavon main hindu vichaardhaara vaale pradhanmantri kaa samarthan kiya

 If Congress thinks so, then they are wrong

 It shows the huge heart of India

 lekin mushkil kaam ab shuru ho rahaa he, jab saat sadsy deshon ko apane sansadhano kaa istemaal karke jamini str kii avasanrachana taiyaar kerani he or upgrah se bheji jane vaali jaankaree ke liye software ko taiyaar rakhana he
 This work is easy to say but it is quite difficult to do it

 a day that has never come before
 do saal pehle, bharat ne ek vaada kiya tha

 unhone kaha, dakshin asia upgrah kaa safal prakshepan us vaade ko puraa karata he
 With this launch, we have started the journey to build the most forward front of our partnership

 Pakistan kept itself out of this space program citing its space program
 jabaki har koi jaanata he ki uskaa yah kaarykram bharat kii atyaadhunik antariksh kshamtaaon kii tulana main bahut peeche he or abhi shuruuaati charan main hi he
 The CAG has reprimanded ISRO
 There is no doubt that India's capabilities in space technology are of high standard, but the proverbial proverb has started to be applied to many space assets of the country
 purv main kaig ne bhi isro ko fatkaar lagaai thi ki desh ke bade remote sencing upgrahon dwaara antariksh se lee gai tasveeron kaa istemaal kyon nahin kiya gaya? ye tasviren taale main band padi raheen or asainya yojanakaaron ko uplabdh hi nahin karai gayi

 In daily life, when someone gets an expensive gift, which needs to spend a lot of money on its maintenance, it often throws dust
 lakhon dollar kharchane honge saarc deshon kohm ummid karte hai ki afghanistan, nepal, bhutan, bangladesh, srilanka, maldive or bharat ek saath milakar or alag-alag kai lakh dollar lagaayenge jo ki is upgrah ke laabh hasil karne ke liye jaruri honge
 Other reasons for not being able to make full use of this valuable gift from India could also be that India's neighboring countries either already have communication satellites or are working towards acquiring them
 
 afghanistan ke raashtrapati ashraf gani ne kaha tha, yadi ham jameen par sahyog nahin kar sakate, to kam se kam aasmaan main to sahyog kar hi sakate hai
 Sources say that there is still an agreement with this country
 iske liye ve takneekee kaarnon kaa hawala dete hai
 Afghanistan already has a satellite called Afghansat
 yah ek sanchaar upgrah he, jise usne ek europea desh se patte par liya he
 It remains to be seen how the Afghan people make the final decision to use the services of the South Asia satellite

 With this, Bangladesh started expanding its capabilities in space without waiting for the South Asia satellite

 isliye maine in jabardast maukon ko sweekaar kar liya or un filmon ('darty pikchar' or 'kahani') ne (nayika kendrit bhoomika vaali filmon) ke liye kaamyaab rasta banaaya
 He said, i like to take credit for it (women-centric films are now making money)
 
 
 jab koi yah kahata he to main bahut vinamr ho jaati hum
 But the truth of my mind is that cinema shows reality and the reality around us is that most women are living life on their own terms
 unhone kaha, haa, main ek laalchee abhinetri hum
 
 
 So i accepted these tremendous opportunities and those films ('dirty Picture' and 'kahaani') paved the way for (heroine-centric films)
 unhone kaha, mujhe iskaa (mahila kendrit filmein ab paisa kama rahi he) shrey lenaa pasand he
 
 
 i become very polite when someone says this
 lekin mer khyaal se sachai yah he ki cinema vaastaviktaa dikhaata he or hamaare aasapaas kii vaastaviktaa yah he ki zyaadaatar mahilaayein apni sharton par jivan ji rahi hai
 He said, i like to take credit for it (women-centric films are now making money)
 
 
 jab koi yah kahata he to main bahut vinamr ho jaati hum

 The film is scheduled to release on 17 November this year
 relies se pehle hi uttar pradesh ke mujffarnagar main kuch asaamaajik tatv iskaa virodh karne par utar aae hai
 Direction Harish Kumar has said in an interview that he has dared to show the bad effects of communal riots in the film
 nirdeshak ne sawaal khadaa kiya he ki jab sensor board ne is film ko dekhne ke baad paas kar diya he to phir iskaa virodh kyon kiya ja rahaa he?padmavati par roak lagane se chunaav ayog kaa inkaar, BJP ne kii thi mangadiarector ne kaha ki yah filmkaar hi hai jinamein sampradayik dangon ke bure prabhaav ko dikhaane kii himmat hoti he

 He said that if this continues to happen, the same situation will happen for film makers in the country as those who commit suicide
 harish bole, 'ek kisaan bina barish or sarkari sahaayta ke aatmahatya karne par majaboor ho jaataa he
 Exactly the same is happening with filmmakers in the film industry

 Kejriwal said, "they are not making the CBI independent in this bill

 Somewhere there is no psychiatric disorder: Many times this habit develops in children also due to some kind of psychiatric disorder
 yadi aisa he to bachche ko kisi manochikitsak ke paas le jaaen
 How to identify if there is a psychiatric disorder
 
 
 - cychetric dysorder se jujh rahe bachche hyper active hote hai
 They cannot sit in one place
 - aise bacchon ko dhyaan ekagra karne main bhi dikkat hoti he
 They are very difficult to maintain a place of care
 - ziddee hote hai or jaldi uttejit bhi ho jate hai
 If you are seeing these symptoms in your child then do not delay in taking him to a psychiatrist
 kyonki umr ke saath samasyaayein bhi badi ho sakati hai

 In the Australian Open badminton final on Sunday, India's star shuttler Kidambi Srikanth will face his longtime rival Chen Long of China

 The performance of Super Kings, which won the IPL title last year, has not been in line with its credibility
 usne ab tak kul saat match khele hai, jinamein se chaar main use jeet mili he jabaki teen main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 This performance has raised questions about Dhoni's ability as a captain, but as it is known that his journey in the IPL has just reached half a distance, there is nothing to worry about
 deccan ko haraane ke baad yah team agar apana aage kaa safar manmutabik jari rakhane main safal rahati he to vah final main pahunchane kaa haq hasil kar sakati he lekin iske liye use 2010 jaisaa pradarshan doharaana hoga
 On the other hand, the Chargers, who won the title under the captaincy of Adam Gilchrist in 2009, have a chance to beat the Super Kings to improve their position at the table and present themselves as the final-4 contending teams
 ipel ke is satr main donon tiimon kii yah pehali bhidnt he

 In such a situation, Dhoni's team will have to decide their strategy on the basis of Ishant and Stan because these two bowlers are enough to throw away any attack line
 beshak dhoni ke paas achche ballebaaj or gendbaaj hai lekin iske baavjood unhen deccan ko kamatar aankane kii bhul nahin kerani chahie

 Party workers and other aspiring leaders do not see the same loyalty to the second generation of the Lalu family - both Lalu's sons and daughter Misa - in the 90s
 vaishali zile ke mahua main tej pratap kii ummidavaari kaa virodh is baat ko spasht karata he
 The most favorable political situation for Lalu will be when this election becomes a purely forward versus backward war on the lines of the 90s
 lalu ko pataa he ki gavarnence yaa delivery unki takat nahin he
 Hence, 'social justice', caste equations and 'secularism' are their biggest weapons
 haalanki kamandal ko mandal se jodne kii bijepi kii koshish lalu ke raste kaa kanta ban sakati he
 The attitude of the largest group of OBC voters, ie Yadav voters, is going to have an impact on the election results

 jdujoon's alliance with BJP for JDU, which was part of NDA till 2013, cemented its social base
 gathbandhan khatm hone se achaanak jediu bihar kii raajnneeti main akeli pad gai
 a large section of the society, especially the upper castes, left Nitish
 nitish is baat ko samaj chuke hai ki unki tamaam koshishon ke baavjood agadi jatiyaan shaayad jediu ko vot naa karen lihaaja unhone apni hi party ke vidhayakon anant singh or sunil pandey ko unke haal par chhod diya he
 Nitish broke the alliance when his own vote bank was not fully formed
 mahadalit, ati pichhadi jatiyon (ibisi) ke jis vot bank ko nitish apane paale main karne kii jugat main lage the vah prakriya tabatak puri nahin hui thi
 Due to this, JDU was reduced to just 2 seats in the Lok Sabha elections
 loksabhaa chunaav nateezon se spasht he ki kurmi or koiri ko chhod den to bihar kii baaki duusari dabang jatiyon ne jediu ke paksh main matdaan nahin kiya
 In spite of all this, good work and clear image of 'good governance' and economic-social development done as Chief Minister is definitely the biggest strength of Nitish
 unke mukaable endie gathbandhan main kisi spasht netritv kaa naa hona nitish ke paksh main jaataa he

 endiedilli main mili karaari haar se brands modi par jo dhabba laga bijepi ke liye usko saaf karne kaa sabase prabhavi avasar bihar chunaav he
 For Bihar Fatah, the party is going to resort to 'saam daam dand bhed'
 bijepi apane hisaab se bihar chunaav kaa agenda tay karnaa chaahati he
 Efforts are on to create a synergy between Modi's evolutionary politics and the ground reality of caste equations
 janata parivaar ke liye sabase adarsh or aasaan sthiti tab hoti agar bijepi kisi netaa ko apana mukhyamantri ummidavaar ghoshit karti
 lalu-nitish will be heartened that BJP should make any upper caste its chief ministerial candidate
 aise main bihar chunaav ko mandal banaam kamandal banane kii unki chahat sahaj hi puri ho sakegi
 The statement of Giriraj Singh that no upper caste can become the Chief Minister of Bihar needs to be seen in this background
 bijepi puri shiddat ke saath lalu ke yadav matadaataaon or nitish ke mahadalit or ibisi matadaataaon ko apane paale main karne kii koshish main lagi he
 The outright mobilization of Muslim votes in favor of the lalu-nitish-congress-ncp could be damaging for the BJP
 lihaaja bijepi ko apana maujuuda aadhaar barkaraar rakhte hue kai duusare saamaajik virgon ko apane paale main laane kii chunauti he
 Together with Ram Vilas Paswan, Upendra Kushwaha and Jitan Ram Manjhi, the BJP is required to meet this challenge
 4
 Jitan Ram Manjhi During his 9 months as Chief Minister, Manjhi increased his stature by his statements
 haalanki unke kaamkaaj ko ‘sushasan’ ke saanche main rakhana mushkil he
 Manjhi's social base is limited and his strength as a separate entity in electoral politics has not been tested yet
 kuch jaankaar to unhen mahadaliton ke puure samooh kaa netaa tak maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 He says that Manjhi's leadership is limited only to his own caste and he is getting more importance than his weight
 5
 The Left has adopted the policy of Ekla Chalo Re in Bihar for the purpose of maintaining its existence apart from the Left alliance
 haalanki left ke alag chunaav ladane se endie ke mukaable mahagathbandhan ko zyaada pareshaani ho sakati he

 pappu yadavakosi or simanchal ke ilaake main pappu ne apane dabang andaaz se apana ek nishchit aadhaar taiyaar kiya he
 However, he seems to be failing in his attempts to join the NDA so far
 bihar bijepi ke liye pappu kaa saath lene kaa faisla karnaa aasaan nahin hoga kyonki lalu ke jangalraj ko chunavi mudda banane kii bijepi kii koshishon par iskaa nishchit asar hoga
 Progressive voters who vote on development issues other than caste will not be able to digest it easily
 par bijepi ke liye pappu kii ahmiyat se inkaar bhi nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Pappu is easing bjp's path by constantly targeting Lalu and his two sons
 yadav matadaataaon tak yah sandesh pahunchane kii koshish ho rahi he ki lalu ab puri jamaat nahin balki sirf apane parivaar kii chintaa karte hai
 In such a situation, it will be interesting to see what role Pappu Yadav plays in the elections

 Sampling error 2

 The Gallup poll includes the results for the past seven days and Obama is ahead of Romney by 48 percent against 44 percent
 isamen namoonay kii galati do pratishat se kam yaa adhik he
 In the Newsweek / Daily Best poll, Obama is 47 percent ahead of Romney, 44 percent
 isamen chaar pratishat se kam yaa adhik kii namoona truti he
 But cnn's poll showed Romney to be 51 percent ahead of Obama's 43 percent of the 15 states depicted as the electoral fray on cnn's poll map
 aakade haalanki yah sanket nahin karte ki kin rajyon main romany jeet rahe hai yaa vahaan unhen vaaki main kitna laabh mil saktaa he
 CNN has stated that no candidate needs to win in all 15 of those states to win the general election, so the overall results of all 15 states do not predict either Obama's defeat or Romney's victory
