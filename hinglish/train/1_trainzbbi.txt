 ’ Facing India's displeasure over the mention of indo-pak relations in the us-china joint statement and offering mediation, China, while directly negotiating, has asked India that it intends to play an intermediary role in indo-pak relations
 Is not
 bharat sarkaar ke sutron ke mutabik china ne bharat se kaha he ki vah bharat ke is rukh kaa sammaan karata he ki bharat-paak sambandhon main kisi tisare paksh ke dakhal kii jarurat nahin he
 According to sources who visited the US with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, China has said that there is no change in its position that the nature of indo-pak relations is bilateral
 beete saptaah beijing main america raashtrapati baraak obama or chini raashtrapati hu jintaao ke bich baatcheet ke baad donon netaaon ne china-america sanyukt bayaan jari kiya tha jisamen bharat-paak sambandhon kaa ullekh bhi kiya gaya tha
 India had strongly objected to this
 bharat ne saaf shabdon main kah diya he ki bharat-paak sambandhon main use china, america yaa kisi anya tisare desh kaa dakhal manjuur nahin he
 On the issue of granting Chinese visas to Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, Indian government sources say he is trying to find a place for himself and emerge as a 'big middleman'
 sutron ke anusaar, ‘‘china ke pariprekshya main mirwij ‘k’ shabd ko laane kii koshish kar rahe hai jo kahin tikta nahin hai
 According to one source, the Hurriyat leader intended to say that China had a relationship with the Kashmir issue as a part of the state was under the control of Aksai China
 sutron ne doharaaya ki mirwij samuchit vija par china jane ke liye swatantra hai

 iske baad team anna or baba ramdev ke bich kii matbhed khulkar saamne aa gai thi
 On the Lokpal issue, Baba Ramdev said that there will not be a Lokpal in Haridwar and Ralegan Siddhi

 a 7 year old is kidnapped & gang raped
 
 Enough is enough, the culprits should be flogged & hanged publicly- # justicefordivya # mandsaurgiven the alarming frequency and the sheer perversion of the crime, one must ask
 
 Is our country no longer safe for children? # justicefordivya # mandsaurdisturbing details emerge from # Mandsaur
 How can anyone do this to another human being, let alone a child? Depravity! Kudos to Mandsaur Superintendent of Police for nabbing the culprit within the day and to Yunus Shaikh for announcing the accused will get no burial
 nitish ne guuruuvaar se bihar kii paanch vidhansabha or ek loksabhaa seat ke liye prachaar shuru kiya

 According to Nitish, there are some people who keep talking like this because such people love that when printed in the newspaper, they keep on speaking something
 iske baad nitish ne phir duharaaya ki uske chakkar main mat padie, yahaan par ham logon kii ekajutata he
 It is clear from Nitish's speech that he has described his critics as a patient of Chhatra disease and has made it clear to the workers that there is no need to give preference to such people
 nishchit rup se unka ishaara kendriya mantri giriraaj singh kii taraf tha, jinhen upachunaav main kahin bhi prachaar ke liye na to nitish kumaar ne, na hi unki party bhaajapa ne kaha he
 Nitish Kumar, who is facing criticism from the general public and the court due to water logging, however said in his speech that we are advancing Bihar

 Through this film, Deepika Padukone is going to be seen in the role of an acid attack Survivor for the first time
 is film kii shooting dilli main hui thi or soshal media kii badaulat ham sabhi ko sets se li hui photose or videos dekhne ko mili thim
 Not only this, when the film's makers released the first poster of the film, the fans on social media were shocked

 Deepika's character is named in the film
 deepika ne jalaae apane prosthetics?is film main acid atake cerviver ke role ko nibhaane ke liye deepika ne prosthetics kii madad lee thi
 Deepika used to sit and get her look ready for acid attack Survivor
 haalanki ab ek intervyuu main unhone bataaya he ki chhapaak kii aakhri din kii shooting ke baad deepika ne us prosthetic se bane luk ko jala diya tha
 Deepika said, 'I took a piece of prosthetic, took alcohol, went to the corner and burnt it
 'ek actor kaa apane kirdaar se jud janaa laazmi hota he

 In today's time, there will be very few people who use metal tiffins or containers
 aaj ke samay main logon ke rahane kaa tarika badal chukaa he
 Most people use plastic containers and tiffin only
 ek ore jahaan in plastic ke contanners ko ek jagah se duusari jagah le janaa apekshaakrit aasaan he vahiin inhenasaani se saaf bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 They are also microwave friendly as well
 visheshgyon kii maane to plastic ke contanners kaa istemaal karne main koi buraai nahin he lekin jab plastic kaa rang badalanaa shuru ho jaae use badal dena chahie
 This is the first sign that you should understand by seeing that it is time to change the container
 iske saath hi agar container main rakhaa khaanaa kuch hi der main badboo dene lage yaa phir container se hi badboo aane lage to use phenk dena hi behatar hoga
 While there is a time limit for the use of plastic containers like everything else, it is also necessary to ensure that you clean them properly
 agar aap plastic ke contanners kaa istemaal kar rahe hai to aapako unki dekharekh kaa sahi tarika bhi pataa hona chahie
 By doing this your containers will stay with you for a long time
 in tareekon ko apanaakar aap apane plastic contanners ko lambey samay tak kharaab hone se bachaa sakate hai
 1
 plastic container kii badbaagar aapako lag rahaa he ki aapke container se plastic kii badboo aa rahi he to ek baaltee main garm pani bhar lijie
 Add three spoons of baking soda to it and mix well
 apane contanners ko baaltee main bhare pani main daal dijie
 Check that the containers are well immersed in water
 contanners ko lagbhag aadhe ghante ke liye pani main dubokar hi rakhen
 After half an hour take them out and wash them with clean water
 baavjood iske agar contanners main badboo rah gai ho to aap ye doosraa tarika apana sakate hai
 Take a bucket of warm water and mix two lemon juice and vinegar in it
 apane plastic contanners ko is ghol main daal den
 After 10 minutes, take out the containers and dry them
 2
 If you smell foul-smelling food from your plastic container, it is best to use liquid chlorine bleach
 aap is ghol main container ko dubokar kuch der ke liye chhod dijie
 This will also remove the stains on the container
 aap chahen to garm pani main surf daalkar bhi apane plastic container ko saaf kar sakate hai
 If your container does not smell, try not to stop eating them for too long

 The government and military have also spoken about action
 lekin vishwa hindu parishad kii ne jawaab se ek kadam aage badhkar yuddh kii demand kar daali he
 VHP international president Pravin Togadia has said that India is a country of knights
 unhone kaha, 'hamaari thal sena, airforce, navy, siaisef, biguef, police, homeguard sabhi desh kii suraksha main din-raat lage hai or har din apni shahadat de rahe hai
 Togadia said that Pakistan is continuously attacking India, every day soldiers are dying
 aise main pakistan ko gale lagane kaa vakt ab khatm ho gaya he
 Apart from direct political strikes, not surgical strikes, the demands of surgical strikes against Pakistan are again rising from many fronts
 lekin togadiya ne isse aage badhkar sarkaar se ection kii apil kii he
 Togadia has said that no longer a surgical strike, the government should directly fight Pakistan
 togadiya ne ye bhi kaha, 'kai pariwaron ne swatantraaa paane main or seemaa raksha main swajanon ko khoyaa he
 The country will not forget the soldiers who have been killed
 yuddh koi nahin chahta he, lekin pakistan lagaataar bharat par hamale kar rahaa he
 Everyday young people are dying
 pakistaniyon ko gale lagaana bahut ho gaya
 How much sacrifice in the name of diplomacy? Not surgical, now direct war
 'isse aage togadiya ne ye bhi kaha ki deshbhakti or rashtraraksha sirf naare lagane, bhaashan dene, jhande fahraane bhar kii nahin hoti he
 Now the government should fight with Pakistan, the whole country will stand with it
 argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav se ranchi milane ja rahe unke bade bete tej pratap yadav kii raste main tabiyat bighad gai
 After this, he stopped at Jehanabad and got his checkup done
 doctor ne jaanch kii or bataaya ki depressant ke chalate blad pressure (beepi) lo ho gai he
 Please tell that Tej Pratap Yadav left Ranchi on Monday to meet Lalu
 lalu prasad yadav kaa ilaaj ranchi ke rems main chal rahaa hai, lekin raste main hi unki achaanak tabiyat kharaab ho gai
 After this, Tej Pratap stopped in Jehanabad and showed the doctor
 somvaar ko ranchi ravaanaa hone se pehle tejpratap yadav ne kaha tha ki unhen loksabhaa chunaav ladane main koi dilchaspee nahin he or vah 2019 main chunaav nahin ladanaa chaahate hai
 The Chhapra Lok Sabha seat has been a traditional seat of the Lalu family
 haalanki chaara ghotaale main lalu prasad yadav ke sajayaftaa hone ke baad jab rabari devi ne chhapra se pichhlaa chunaav ladaa tha to vah vahaan se haar gai thim
 In fact, as the Lok Sabha elections come closer, there are constant speculations about who will contest the elections from Chapra
 tej pratap yadav se jab aishwarya raay kii shaadi hui thi to is seat ke liye unka bhi naam uchhla, lekin ek to unki umr abhi 25 saal kii nahin thi duusare ab court main talaak kaa maamla chale jane ke baad isaki gunjaaish nahin bachi he
 There was also speculation that Lalu Yadav's Samadhi and Chandrika Rai were also willing to contest from Chhapra
 mana jaataa he ki tej pratap or aishwarya ke bich anban kii ek vajah yah bhi thi
 However, on Sunday, Tej Pratap Yadav suddenly announced to go to RJD Dattar and become active in politics again
 somvaar ko isi mudde ko lekar wo apane pita se milane ranchi ravaanaa ho gaye
 It is believed that Tej Pratap Yadav will ask Lalu Yadav to give him a place in the party
 saath hi tej pratap apane pita se talaak dilwane main madad kii maang kar sakate hai
 Tej Pratap said that he is going to meet his father and he will do the same politics in Bihar
 ravivaar ko tej pratap yadav ne kaha tha ki wo vrundavan se vardaan lekar aae hai or bihar ke kurushetra main virodhiyon par sudarshan chakra chalaayenge
 However, Tej Pratap, who reached the RJD office in Patna on Sunday, said that he would not leave any stone unturned in preparing for the Lok Sabha elections
 iske baad somvaar ko unka ye bayaan aayaa he
 The first budget of the Narendra Modi government will be presented in the tough economic phase in July
 phir bhi ummiden bepanaah hai
 Economic growth rate in 2013-14 slightly lower than expected4
 7 fisadi thi
 Inflation rate in retail commodities 8
 5 fisadi he, jo pehle ke mukaable sudhari hui he magar ab bhi itani zyada he ki bhartiya rigerv bank byaaj daron par ankush lagaae rakhane ko baadhya he
 There is also no shortcut to accelerating economic growth or controlling inflation
 akele bajet bhi nitiyon ke jariye donon se nahin nipat saktaa
 Nevertheless, there is a huge buzz about the budget as it is being considered as the first opportunity for the Modi government to step up on its promise to improve the economy
 kai log vittiya shuchita ke daur kii vaapasi chaahate hai
 However
4 of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2013–14
 5 fisadi kaa rajkoshiya ghaataa bahut bura nahin lagata
 So, then 4 of it in 2014-15
 1 fisadi or 2015-16 main 3
 What is the harm in sticking to the target of bringing 6 per cent and 3 per cent next year? The argument is also that 4
 5 fisadi kaa str 2014-15 par taale gaye kharch ke saath yojana yaa puunjigat nivesh main katautee ko dhyaan main nahin rakhata
 Therefore, if there is a goal of reducing the deficit to GDP ratio to foster economic growth, then should we blindly look at 2014-15
 1 fisadi kaa lakshya rakh lenaa chahie? vittiya daayitv va bajet prabandhan kanoon, 2003 kii ore lautnaa or use dhyaan main rakhkar raah bananaa ek baat he, lekin use 2014-15 main hi lagu karnaa duusari baat
 The problem is not just the fiscal deficit, but the revenue deficit and the synergy between government spending and revenue is also serious
 rajasav kharch ke bade madon main byaaj bhugtan, sabsidi, vetan, pension, raksha kharch ke saath-saath rajyon kaa anudaan kaa he, jinase puunjigat sampattiyaan khadi kii jaati hai
 Whatever our view of the subsidy cut, it is not possible to do this without negotiating and consenting the states about the identity of BPL families
 beshak, phijulkharchi or anutpaadak sarkari kharchon ko ghataane kii gunjaaish he
 But it is impractical to expect this to be done in 2014-15 itself
 ab kar rajasav kii baat karen
 The Direct Taxes Code, relaxed, is no longer the same
 or guds and services tex vyavastha laane ke pehle kai maamle nibatane jaruri hai
 For example, in the case of which services or goods to be exempted, what will be the special arrangement for double rates, what will happen to stamp duty, octroi and taxes on alcohol, petroleum products, tobacco, and the basis of revenue compensation to the states
 
 isliye, adhik se adhik iraadon kaa hi sanket diya ja saktaa he
 How can we expect sudden tax reforms in the budget? 5 of GDP by tax concessions
 3 fisadi rakam bekaar chali jaati he lekin use hataane par sahmati nahin he
 Therefore, we should expect some rational and balanced system
 lekin hamen pichhali tarikhon se lagu hone vaale praavdhaanon ke dur karne or kar ko lekar chal rahe mukademon se mukti paane kii ummid jarur kerani chahie
 The market and external observers are keen on privatization
 sarkari bainkon main puunji hissedari ghataakar us rakam ko bainkon ko majboot karne main lagane kii baaten bhi chal rahi hai
 In this case, separate the debate as to whether the deficit in revenue expenditure should be offset by selling assets
 chunki lakshya punarsangyojan kaa he to kya hamen saarvajanik upakramon ke nijeekaran kii ummid kerani chahie? asal main sarkaar ke paas rajasav or kharch, donon hi maamalon main bade sudhaar karne kii aazaadee simit hi he
 The UPA-2 government's financial management was not so good because its assessment of economic growth went wrong
 so, isi morche par bajet ke aankade dekhnaa dilachasp hona chahie
 Actual growth 5 in 2014-15
 5 fisadi se adhik rahane kii ummid nahin he
 Hence 12 in GDP
 5 fisadi se adhik kii vruddhi kaa anumaan bemaani he jabaki ekaadhik bajaton main 14-14
 a target of 5 percent growth has been set
 iskaa matlab he ki agar sakal kar rajasav main vruddhi, maan lijie ki 17
 If the target is more than 5 per cent, then there is a need to check the figures of assessment, the orderliness and the details of various tax items
 kai ghoshnaaon main vitt mantralay ke alaava kriyanvayan ke str par duusare mantralay or rajya jude hote hai
 Nevertheless, we continue to bring supplementary budgets with policy announcements
 isi vajah se endie-1 ke daur samet kai vitt mantri vaadon main bahadur magar jameen par phisaddhi rahe
 We should expect better coordination and implementation among ministries in the NDA-2 era
 talmail ke abhaav main hi upie-2 ke daur main nivesh ke maamalon kii cabinet cameti akatati rahi he, ab isamen sudhaar dikhataa he
 So, what policy announcements can we expect in the 2014-15 budget? These may be related to FDI, processes, electricity, skills, education, housing, transportation, urbanization, health, IT, and law and order
 inamen zyaadaatar kaa sambandh rajyon se hai
 Therefore, it will not be important what kind of plans were announced and what provisions were made in the budget for them, rather it would be important to know what incentives were given to the states to implement the reforms and what was done for decentralization
 manaregaa, khaadya suraksha kanoon, or bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon main sanshodhan ke maamle ahm ho sakate hai
 Packaging has its own importance in every budget
 modi sarkaar ke pehle bajet ke liye donon hi maamle ahm honge

 film dream girl dekhne ke baad meraa bhi aisa hi haal he
 Ever since i saw this film, the same thing has been coming in my mind that my film was okay, but it was not fun
 majaa kyon nahin aayaa ye bhi bataa detii hum- kyonki film main dheron kamiyaan hai
 Seeing the promos and trailers of the film, the expectations that all of us have set, there are few chances of its completion
 kahani kii baat karen to ye he hamaare karamvir (ayushmaan khurana) ke bare main, jo theatre ke play main sita or draupadi jaise kirdaaron ko nibhaataa he
 Karam can make a girl's voice and hence she is given the character of girls in the play
 or bhai sahab ladkaa sita maiyaa ke naam se sheharbhar main femes bhi bahut he
 Karam's needs are bigger than his salary and he is not getting a job
 to wo apane tallent kaa istemaal karata he or kol centre main 'puja' banakar kaam karne lagata he
 When Karam starts talking as a worshiper in the call center, people like his words so much that he starts falling in love with 'pooja'
 ab puja ke paas cholors nahin aashiq hai, jo use paane ke liye apni jaan de sakate hai, bivi ko chhod sakate hai or yahaan tak ki apana dharm bhi badal sakate hai

 After this, there is the entry of Mahi (nushrat Bharucha), which he gives his heart
 karam kii jindagi set hone hi lagati he ki usamen tante hone shuru ho jate hai
 The same trenches that have taken place in all of us at some point in time, that is to enter his professional life into his personal life and then create turmoil
 yahi se shuru hota he sara drama
 Now let's do the real thing and that is the screenplay of the film
 film ko dekhakar lagata ki iskaa screenple kuch puraani filmon se prerit he
 The problem of the film is that the learning it imparts to you, itself rejects it the very next moment
 jahaan ek taraf isamen kaha ja rahaa he ki kisi ladki ko uske profeshan ke hisaab se jaj nahin karnaa chahie vahiin duusare hi pal puja ko har jagah looj karactor bataaya ja rahaa he
 Apart from this, why we are yet to see a better way of impressing a girl in films is beyond my comprehension
 karam ko maahi se pehali najar main pyaar ho jaataa he lekin use paane ke liye wo uskaa peechha karata he
 Then when her theft is caught, Mahi also falls in love with her
 kamaal he !yun to ye kamedi film he lekin aapako bahut si baar lagegaa ki isamen aapako jabardastee hansaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 But this does not mean that the film does not have good jokes or sequences
 film kaa plus point he isamen kii gai acting
 Ayushman Khurana is the hero of the film and it would not be wrong if i say that this is Ayushman Khurana's show
 ayushmaan ne apane kirdaar or aawaaj kar jo pakad banaai he wo tarif ke laayak he
 This film is another example of how talented artists Ayushman is
 film main unki acting, kamedi, dance sab acha he
 Anu Kapoor, who became the father of Karam (ayushmann), has a good job and takes away a lot of space from the limelight Ayushman
 abhishek bannerjee apane kirdaar main bahut sahi hai or agar unhen thodaa or screen time diya jaataa to kamaal ho jaataa
 Raj Bhansali's character is fun and Vijay Raj is as brilliant as ever
 manjot singh ko phukare ke baad dobaaraa acha kaam karte dekhakar khushi hui
 Nushrat Bharucha did not get much to do, but he did as much as he got
 iske alaava film main najar aae baaki saporting actors kaa bhi kaam acha he
 There are many jokes in the film, which have made you laugh because of the actors' good acting and delivery
 slo shuru hui film dream girl kabhi apni raftaar pakadati he to kabhi dhimi pad he
 It was said that it is set in Mathura, but you will definitely find it difficult to understand where its story is set
 upi ke board or haryana police ke bairigade dekhakar kanfusion hota he
 Yes, its songs are good
 jahaan dil kaa telephone song aapke dimag main ghar kar letaa he vahiin radhe radhe kii koreography kaaphi badhiya he
 These films are entertaining, but the climax does not please you at all
 clymex main uthal-puthal dikhaane kii koshish bahut kii gai lekin afsos isamen naakamayaabi haath lagi

 Samajwadi Party (SP) mentor and former Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav said on Saturday that Pakistan cannot compete with India, the real threat to the country is not from Pakistan but from China
 mulaayam shanivaar ko bakshi kaa talab ilaake main chandrika devi mandir main sapa netaa or purv saansad bhagwati singh ke janmotsav kaarykram par logon ko sambodhit kar rahe the tabahi unhone kaha ki china ke khilaaf ham sab ko ek saath khadaa hona padegaa, china ke saath kisi bhi sangharsh main ham centre sarkaar ke saath hai'
 Talking about Pakistan and China during the ceremony, Mulayam said, 'I have been saying for 20 years that India is in danger from China, not Pakistan, Pakistan cannot compete with India and as far as China is concerned, we All is one, the country will have to stand together on China
 china ke saath kisi bhi sangharsh main ham centre sarkaar ke saath hai'
 At the same time, he said that 'china is plotting to capture Sikkim and Bhutan, they have fully prepared to attack India'
 mulaayam ne centre ko china se satark rahane kii naseehat di or kaha ki china ko lekar centre sarkaar ko sarvadaleey baithak bulani chahie
 Despite raising this issue many times, the central government is not telling what steps India is taking against China '
 centre main ek baar ban chuki tisare morche kii sarkaar kii baat karte hue unhone kaha, 'agar ham us samay pradhanmantri ban jate to aaj bhootpurv pradhanmantri hi rahete to kya bighad jaataa'
 Praising Bhagwati Singh, Mulayam said that 'bhagwati Singh is a socialist saint, he never asked for anything, learn politics and social service from activist Bhagwati Singh'

 aap netaaon kaa daawa punjab main kabhi bhi ho saktaa he bada ulatpheranvjot singh siddhu ko bataaya bade kad kaa netaa or congress main upekshitpunjab main aam aadmi party lagaataar congress se naaraaz chal rahe netaaon or vidhayakon ko lekar siyaasi daanv chalane main lagi he
 In the latest development, Aman Arora, Punjab's co-president of Aam Aadmi Party, said about Navjot Singh Sidhu that he too is against the policies of the government of his own party
 unhone aage kaha ki navjot singh siddhu kaa jo kad he agar bhavishya main koi nayaa raajnneetik sameekaran banataa he to navjot singh siddhu ko unke raajnneetik kad ke hisaab se kisi oonche paaydaan par pahunchnaa chahie
 Aman Arora's gesture was on the Chief Minister's chair as Aman Arora is constantly trying to get Congress mlas who are angry with Captain Amarinder Singh for not listening to their own government and not getting the job done
 Can go aman aroda ne yah bhi elaan kiya he ki congress ke kai naaraaz vidhayak unke saath lagaataar sampark main hai or aane vaale dinon main punjab kii raajnneeti main koi bada ulatpher ho saktaa he
 Along with this, he also said that the mlas who are angry with the Congress should also separate from the Congress and form a government with the Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab so that they can fulfill the promises made to the public through the government and Navjot Singh Sidhu Those who have been completely sideline in the Punjab government at this time should also become part of this government
 vahiin aam aadmi party ke ek or vidhayak kultar singh sandhwa ne kaha ki punjab main jin congress ke vidhayakon ke kaam unki hi apni sarkaar main nahin ho rahe hai wo dilli main arvind kejariwal or aam aadmi party ke sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ko dekhen or aam aadmi party ke saath milakar punjab main sarkaar bana len
 Like Delhi, in Punjab, this government will show excellent work on issues like electricity, water and schools
 kultar singh sandhwa ne kaha ki punjab congress ke kai vidhayak arvind kejariwal ke dilli sarkaar main kiye gaye kaamkaaj se prabhavit hai or punjab main aam aadmi party ke saath sampark main hai
 On this issue, Congress leaders mocked Aman Arora's claim and said that first the Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab should manage its internal breakdowns and pay attention to the frequent legislators who are tearing them down
 uske baad congress ke naaraaz vidhayakon ko saath main lekar sarkaar banane kii baat karen
 No MLA in Punjab is angry with his government
 parivaar ke sadasyon main halki-phulki baaten to chalati hi rahati hai or bartan aapas main bajte rahete hai
 Akali Dal leader Bikram Singh Majithia said that on the matter of raising the name of Navnjot Singh Sidhuka and Navjot Kaur Sidhu's contact with the angry Congress mlas

 Majithia said that it is absolutely true that in the Congress government of Punjab, one of his own mlas does not work and they are neither heard nor the work done in their areas
 isi vajah se kai vidhayak apni sarkaar se naaraaz hai par ye naaraaz vidhayak chaah kar bhi kuch nahin kar sakate or agar aisa koi bhi vidhayak jo sarkaar kii nitiyon ke khilaaf he or punjab main faile bhrashtachar or khanan or anya mafia ke khilaaf he to wo agar chaahe to akali dal ke saath aakar khadaa ho saktaa he
 It is quite true that many Congress mlas of Punjab are very angry with Captain Amarinder Singh and the State's bureaucracy in the state for not listening to their government and not working in their areas, and have expressed their displeasure openly
 in vidhayakon kii naaraazgi ko dekhte hue ab aam aadmi party or akali dal ne congress ke naaraaz vidhayakon par dore daalane shuru kar die hai

 Dhoni got the turning wicket made in the second Test match played against England in Mumbai but his bet was reversed and India had to face a crushing defeat by ten wickets

 harbhajan ne patrakaron se kaha, ‘‘maichon main haar jeet lagi rahati he
 Losing in a match should not criticize players, especially captains like Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 ’’ He said, "we should not forget that Dhoni is the captain who made us world champions for the first time since 1983

 ’’ Uttar Pradesh will not have one less of 73 seats
 72 kii jagah 74 ho saktaa he
 This statement is of Amit Shah
 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah kaa indian express main lanbaa intervyuu chapa he
 This conclusion from his claim suggests that the alliance of BSP and SP has ended
 is baar phir basapa ko shunya aane vaala he or sapa apane parivaar ke netaaon ko hi jita sakegi
 In 2019, Amit Shah's claim can be laughed out, but in 2014, Amit Shah showed 73 seats as the in-charge of UP
 upi kii raajnneeti ke sabhi dhurandhar jaankaron ko galat sabit kar diya tha
 Will Amit Shah prove all the wrongs wrong this time too? There is no doubt that Amit Shah is very hardworking among the presidents of all the parties of the current era
 aachaar samhita ke baad 100 reliyon kaa aankada chhu chuke hai
 Even before that, they have been doing rallies continuously
 kisi raajnneetik patrkaar ne amit shah kii sabhaaon kaa vishleshan nahin kiya he
 Do people run to their meetings to listen like the Prime Minister? After all, nobody does 100 rallies like this
 kya vaaki amit shah shrotaaon ko aakarshith kar rahe hai? logon ke bich lokapriy netaa ban rahe hai? amit shah kii reliyaan or reliyon main unke aakarshan ko lekar koi baat nahin karata he
 If people are flocking to hear them then it should be written exactly
 uttar pradesh ke bare main amit shah kaa daawa dilachasp he or chunautiyon bharaa he
 UP has been replaced by Amit Shah in his laboratory
 gujarat kii tarah banaaya he yaa kisi or kii tarah, iskaa vishleshan kabhi kisi lekh main dikhaa nahin
 After all, what has Amit Shah done in UP that even after the Samajwadi Party and BSP have united, they are claiming that even after their integration, BJP will get 73 or 74 seats out of 80
 haalanki jab express ke ravish tiwari or raajakmal jha ne poocha ki do charnon ke bare main kya kehete hai to taalte hue jawaab dete hai ki ham 74 siten jeet rahe hai
 After 2014, there were several elections in the country
 upi hi akelaa chunaav tha jisamen amit shah ne tay lakshya se zyaada hasil kar dikhaaya
 In the 2017 elections, BJP had given the slogan of 203 but the party got more than 300 seats
 yani amit shah bhi apane lakshya or lahar kaa moolyankan karne main safal nahin rahe
 Was thinking of getting less than the seats that were coming
 kair upi main duusari baar amit shah ne badi safalataa hasil kii, isliye teesri baar ke daawey par hansane se pehle ek glass pani pi len
 Is it really possible that Akhilesh and Mayawati's alliance will be reduced from 0 to 6
 phir to akhilesh or mayawati ko upi chhod dena chahie, gujarat jaakar raajnneeti kerani chahie
 In 2015, the BJP placed Mission 185 for Bihar
 99 siten ain
 JDU, RJD and Congress government were formed there
 baad main jad you or bijepi kii sarkaar bani
 For the Bengal Legislative Assembly in 2016, Amit Shah gave the slogan of Trinamool Free Bengal
 bijepi ne vahaan 294 main se 150 siton kaa lakshya rakhaa tha
 3 seats came
 pichley saal karnataka vidhansabha ke liye bijepi ne mishan 150 kaa lakshya rakhaa tha
 BJP got 104 seats
 bahut bura nahin kaha jayega magar bijepi sarkaar nahin bana saki
 Congress and JDS government formed
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi bijepi ne mishan 150 kaa lakshya rakhaa
 BJP got 99 seats there
 chhathi baar bijepi sarkaar banane main safal rahi
 Had placed Mission 50 Plus in Himachal Pradesh
 44 siten ain or bijepi kii sarkaar bani
 The BJP was able to win 13 seats in Goa's election
 2012 main 21 siten thim
 a government was formed again, but many parties had to form a government by joining together
 2017 main hi odisha kii raily main amit shah ne 2019 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main 120 siten jeetne kaa daawa kiya tha
 Its account was also explained
 iske liye lakshya rakhaa he ki rajya main 36000 booth hai
 Each booth has to bring 400 votes
 isse ve naveen patnayak ko ukhaad phenkenge
 Let the results come
 amit shah ke is mishan kaa bhi hisaab mil jayega
 It will not be right to dismiss now
 40 se adhik dalon ke saath gathbandhan banaakar chunavi maidan main jane vaali bijepi amit shah kii kamyaabi he yaa naakaami he? 16 rajyon main sarkaar banane ke baad bijepi 2019 main apane dam par chunaavon main nahin ja saki
 Could not go even when it has the biggest brand leader
 uttarakhand main bijepi kii jeet main congress bhi he
 His cabinet also has leaders from Congress
 amit shah dabadabaa banaae rakhane main maahir netaa hai
 It remains to be understood whether his victory is a victory for popularity or a strategy about which people are less aware
 amit shah apane daavon main ajey lagate hai
 Even in gestures
 iske baad bhi amit shah kii ranneeti or nirdesan main bijepi ko bihar, dilli, rajasthan, chhattisgarh or madhyapradesh main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 5 The defeat in Hindi speaking states was no less big but Amit Shah in his confident reply also dismisses it
 upi ko chhod kai rajyon main apane tay lakshya se kam laane vaale amit shah ne 2019 ke liye mishan 400 kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 Targeted 74 out of 80 for UP

 According to the UK government, this step is being taken due to misuse of the Immigration Act
 home secretary theresa me kaa kahana he, 'imigration system british citigen or yogya chaatro kaa dhyaan main rakhkar banaaya gaya he
 But every time, many foreign students come here whose purpose is not right
 aise chaatro ko desh main rahane kaa koi haq nahin he
 For this reason, there has been talk of strict introduction in the system
 'theresa ne is baat ko or spasht karte hue kaha, 'imigration system kaa dushprayog hone par ham hameshaa itani hi sakhti se pesh aaenge or yahi vajah he ki november se student vija milanaa kathin ho jayega
 It is being told that after the changes made in the Immigration Act, if the Home Office rejects the application of students applying to these institutions, then the highly trusted sponsor status of that institution will be taken away and they will not be able to admit new foreign students
 
 gauratlab he ki pichley do saalon main euke main videshi chaatro kii taadaad kam hui he or agar aise main vija niyam sakht ho jaaenge to yah sankhya or kam ho jaaegi
 According to the Foreign Student Higher Education Funding Council for England, the number of students studying here in 2010-11 was 18,535, which decreased to 10,235 in 2012-13

 "I am sadly referring to the illegal arrest and arrest of Tamil Nadu fishermen by the Sri Lankan Navy
" yah silsilaa berokatoke chal rahaa he
 a day before Jayalalithaa wrote the letter, she accused the central government of not making concerted efforts to release Tamil Nadu fishermen

 It is a normal evening and around 20 boys and girls, aged 10–16, in Lepar village of Chanho block of Ranchi are explaining to Shivdayal Munda's house in a threatening manner, "sending your daughter Reena to school from tomorrow
" Start otherwise we kids will eat all the food in your house tomorrow
 phir bhi nahin sudhare to tumhaara raste par chalanaa-phirana band bhi ho saktaa he
 "after this, the army of children threatens Sushma and then goes home to worry
" chintaa ne padhai bich main hi chhod di
 The reason was poverty
 jabaki khelkud main awwal sushamaa ko padhai ek ubaau kaam lagata tha
 But the Bal Panchayat has made it clear in its decision that all these excuses are not going on
 agar ye bachche apane man se skool nahin aa rahe hai to us gaanv ke kya, agal-bagal ke gaanv ke bachche bhi sushamaa or uske jaise bacchon ke saath nahin khelenge
 If their parents want to put them in livelihood and business instead of school, then these children try to convince such parents at their level
 aksar apni koshish main ye safal bhi rahete hai
 Prime Minister of Bal Panchayat Jitendra Kumar Gupta approves the decision of the panchayat, "the father of concern does not want to send him to school
 vah use kheti-mazdooree main lagaana chahta he
 We will try to convince Malu uncle or else he will attack his house
 isse bhi nahin mana to phir mukhiya se shikaayat karenge
 However, the threat of children is enough
 shivadayaal munda ne jab gaanv ke bade bujurgon se in bacchon ko samajhane kii apil kii to un logon ne bhi kisi madad se inkaar kar diya
 Reena has started coming to school and is now the Minister of Defense in the Bal Panchayat

 Where children discuss their problems and make decisions

 ward samiti ke sadsy panchu oraanv bataate hai, ''ye bulaate hai to aana padataa he
 We listen to their problems and try to solve them
 ye bachche apane adhikaar ko lekar kaaphi sajag hai
 In fact, the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh has a big hand in giving direction and momentum to this wonderful movement which has been running many social programs including child education in the most backward areas of Jharkhand
 jab sangh ne is gaanv main skool drop out bacchon ke liye brij course centre kii shuruyaat kii thi, us samay sirf nammaatr ke bachche hi padhane ke liye pahunche
 But within a few days, such children definitely gathered who took the initiative to connect their peers with this center
 aaj is centre par kareeb 45 bachche padhai karne ke liye aate he jo kabhi eent-bhatthe se lekar mazdooree or gharelu naukaron ke kaam kii talash main dilli or bengal bhej die gaye the
 At first the villagers took the children's movement lightly, later they realized the seriousness of the movement of these children
 gaanv ke hi hari munda, jo doordarshan ke kalakaar rah chuke hai, jaise pratishthit log in bacchon ke saath judane shuru ho gaye hai
 Pramod Kumar Verma, a child project manager associated with the Sangh, says excitedly, "the people of the village are coming forward now
" unhone apane kharch se jeern-sheern pade gaanv ke hi ek saamudayik bhawan ko thik-thaak kar in bacchon kii padhai ke liye uplabdh karavaaya he
 Where the center is running now
 ''seve children jaisi antarrastria sanstha bhi ab in bacchon ke andolan main sahyog kar rahi he
 The work of these children is not limited to bringing children of their age to school
 panchayat kii najar aise dallalon par bhi he jo in ilaakon ke garib logon ko unke bacchon ko sunahare kal kaa sapana dikhaa kar bal mazdooree main dhakwl dete he
 Recently, there was a funny incident in the panchayat elections in Jharkhand
 in bacchon ne chunaav pratyaashiyon ko halkaan kar diya tha
 Children's Panchayat again

 If India wants to call a country its permanent friend, Russia will be at the forefront in this race
 rus ne hamen kashmir main beshart sahyog diya he
 When we did nuclear tests, they still stood behind us

 India too has been standing firmly behind Russia
 hamane 1979 main afghanistan par rus ke kabje ke dauraan kabhi uski ninda nahin kii
 Even when he captured Crimea last year, we did not add our voice to the condemnation campaign of other countries
 aaj bhi ham syria main uski sanliptata ko samarthan de rahe hai
 Despite this, there has been some ups and downs in the relationship between the two countries in the recent past
 isaki aanshik vajah yah rahi he ki bharat or america ke bich parmaanu saude ke baad america ke saath bharat ke ranneetik rishte lagaataar bade hai
 The second reason has been that Russia has challenged the US and Europe under Vladimir Putin's regime and in the process it has intensified close ties with India's eternal rival China and has also strengthened relations with Pakistan
 jab 24 disambar ko moscow main salanaa shikhar sammelan ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi raashtrapati putin se milenge, to unka ek uddeshy rus ko is baat se dobaaraa aashwast karnaa hoga ki lagaataar pashchim main kii apni yatraaon ke baavjood bharat unka majboot dost bana hua he
 They will also try to make it clear that they are moving fast on the drunken-friendship vision they had with Putin in Delhi last year to further strengthen and expand bilateral relations in the next decade
 bharat or rus donon ne hi is baat ko mahasoos kiya he ki vaishvik shakti kaa darja hasil karne kii talash main donon ke liye aprihaary ho gaya he ki ve antarang dosti ke maahaul ko barkaraar rakhen
 Russia needs India because it needs a market for its goods so that it can neutralize the West's sanctions because of the actions taken in Ukraine
 iske alaava, america ke aagaamee trans atlantic trade or nivesh saude kii surat main rus apane bazaar ke liye europe ke paar bhi nazren ghumaane ko majaboor hoga
 In this case, India will be its natural partner
 china ke saath apane behaal rishton ke baavjood rus ko jald hi beijing se kadi pratispardhaa kaa saamana karnaa padegaa kyonki china ab america ke saath khud ko nae ji2 kaa hissaa maan rahaa he
 In such a situation, India can help Russia in its multi-polar cooperation
 bharat ko rus kii jarurat isliye he kyonki uske sahare vah apni urja kii jaruratein kifayati daam par puri kar saktaa he
 Despite expanding its defense procurement deals with the US, Israel and Europe, India will still need alliances with Russia to master future technology, including space
 aisa karne se pashchim ke saath bharat kii hathiyaaron kii saudebaaji kii kshamta majboot ho sakegi
 Russia can prove to be a major market for Indian industries for pharmaceutical, manufactured products, dairy products, beef and frozen seafood

 ye ek hi dharm-jati ke yaa alag-alag ho sakate hai
 Since the herd is divided, it can be fought and this fight can be done in the playground and also in the Chacha shop, so that which herd will be paved on such a street, whether the street is Hindu or Muslim, is that hamlet or this locality Of
 yah tay kiya ja sake
 In the city of Piyush Mishra also, the feniers and the scattered pots in the daggers keep fighting for the land, land and Joru
 raajakmal prakaashan se prakashit piyush mishra likhit naatak ‘jab shahar hamaara sota he’ is desh main hone vaale sampradayik dangon ke kaarnon kaa sateek vivaran he
 The story of communal riots in Meerut, Saharanpur and Muzaffarnagar also resembles the 'city' of Piyush
 piyush mishra ke tevar or taab se saje is naatak ko manch par naa dekh paane kaa malaal to mujhe he lekin ise kitaab kii shakl haathon main lekar padhanaa bhi romaanchak he
 The dialogue written by Piyush is Khalish Bhades and this is also the strength of his characters
 
 Like, Tyagi speaks in one scene of the play
 
 'it is too late to fall an arm
 
 
 sab kuch ek minute main yaad aa jayega
 (everyone falls silent) i know your status
 mujhase panga mol mat lenaa
 This street does not belong to your father

 Come on, Aslam, now be the son, with these servants
 anta, cheenta, ghunna, anvei jaise paatr piyush mishra hi chun sakate hai
 It is not that their characters are all masculine
 anwai ek ladki he, jo ladane-maarane ke liye utani hi utaavali rahati jitna hi anta or cheenta, lekin iske thik ulat taraana, tabassum or nishi jaise charitra bhi he jo hinsa ke khilaaf prem or mohabbat ke diye apane haathon par jalaae hai
 The drama stars Piyush Mishra, Manoj Bajpayee, Ashish Vidyarthi, Gajraj Rao and Imtiaz Ali
 iske alaava anya paatr bhi he jinhen apane samay main star kaa darja hasil tha
 Piyush Mishra writes about this drama
 
 'city

 'city

 'city
 
 
 ’gulab kii sugandh, bagule kii fadafadaahat, koyal kii chahachahahat or mor ke naach ke bare main tha
 'city
 
 
 ’ javaani ke sabase pehle chumban ke bare main tha
 And 'city
 
 
 ’ adikaal se phijaaon main goonjati ai aawaaj ‘main tumse pyaar karti hum’ ke bare main tha
 When the play was being played at Mandi House and the theater in Delhi, communalism was blown out of the country
 isi maahaul main ‘act van’ ke jariye piyush mishra apane paatro ke jariye likh or ga rahe the
 When the city sleeps with us, you know what happens to you
 Here the dead bodies are alive, the dead loses life there

 In the words of Sharma, it is a musical drama
 isamen 13 gane hai
 Pigeon is a song
 raat kaa gaanaa he
 There is a song of the policemen and there is also a song for America
 piyush mishra ke paatr jab rache gaye the, tab udaarikaran kaa daur shuru hi hone vaala tha
 But even then, his characters aspired to go to America
 thik aaj ke ucch digridhari profeshnals kii tarah

 Those who open the tongue, they do so

 ye to hua un laundon kaa gaanaa, jo america janaa chaahate hai
 But there is also the song of those pigeons who make a living

 Nights will be woven with silver stars, it will be a bright city
 
 In 2012, Piyush Mishra also sang it in a television channel program, while reading and singing the song, 'wishing someone with moist eyes and holding one's hand and wanting to stick to the wall
 hazrat nizamuddin kii dargah par jaakar bilakhane kii ichha hoti he
 'only when one of the pigeons of the city sleeps' Abhas 'says to his chacha,' If one gets Tarana (love / love) for just twenty-four hours, there is no need to wish for anything else

That i should always be the 'I', who despite being born in this country, cannot get the rights that these people have? 'this is the truth and Piyush Mishra has described it well
 jo piyush mishra ko sirf unke gaanon or filmi kirdaaron ke jariye jaanate hai unhen yah kitaab piyush mishra ke bare main bhi bahut kuch bataati he
 a six-page note written 'from the author' attached to the cover of the book as the opening pages increases the weight of this book by leaps and bounds
 piyush mishra or manoj vaajapeyi ke abhiyan ye sajaa yah naatak dekh paanaa bhale hi mumkin naa ho, lekin iske jariye piyush mishra or unke shahar ke bare main janaa ja saktaa he
 Therefore the sleeping city should be read
 must read
 After expressing concern from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over the role of the opposition in not allowing Parliament to run, the BJP today retaliated and questioned him about ending the deadlock in Parliament from November 10 for conducting the 2G spectrum investigation by JPC
 What efforts did they take? party pravaktaa shahanvaj hossain ne yahaan kaha, ‘pradhanmantri ko yah tathy yaad rakhana chahie ki jepisi kii maang nahin maanane ke sarkaar ke anhakaari ravaiye ke kaaran loksabhaa or rajyasabha main yah gatirodh bana he
 He said, 'the Prime Minister is speaking on the deadlock created in Parliament outside the country
 lekin dilli main rahete unhone is maamle kaa samaadhaan karne kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya
 Far from trying, he did not even open his mouth about this
 ’ bhrashtachar ke maamalon ke liye samprag sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehraate hue bhaajapa pravaktaa ne kaha, ‘tu ji spectrum, rashtramandal khel or adarsh houseing sosayadi sahit bhrashtachar ke jitne bhi maamle hai, unke liye sarkaar samuhik taur par jimmedaar he, kyonki ye singh ke mantriparishad ke sadsy hi hai jo in maamalon main lipt paae gaye hai
 Shahnawaz said, the opposition wants to run parliament smoothly, but the Prime Minister did not contribute to address the reasons for the deadlock
 singh ne berlin yatra ke dauraan samvaadadaataaon ke sawaalon ke jawaab main sansad main bane gatirodh par pratikriya karte hue kaha he ki tu ji spectrum mudde par sansad kaa puraa sheetakaaleen satr hangaame kii bhent chadh jane se vah bharat kii sansadeey vyavastha ko lekar chintit hai
 To this, the BJP spokesperson said, "the first thing the Prime Minister must remember is that the stubborn and vile attitude of his government threatens the democracy of the country
" puraa desh dekh rahaa he ki pradhanmantri ne gatirodh todane ke liye kuch nahin kiya
 "he said," The second thing is that Indian democracy was strong, strong and will remain strong

 In order to strengthen democracy, the opposition is raising issues of corruption in Parliament
 ’shahanwaaz ne aarope lagaaya ki singh sarkaar kii kamazori ke chalate hi unke kaarykaal main itane bade bade bhrashtachar ke maamle hue
 He said, 'manmohan government's image has been tarnished
 ham sarkaar ko ek baar phir yaad dilaanaa chaahate hai ki jepisi ke mudde par vipaksh ekajute he or jab tak sarkaar iske liye sahamat nahin hoti ham ise sansad ke bheetar or sansad ke baahar uthaate rahenge

 Let us tell you that the sanitation workers have been demanding cashless cards for a long time, so that they can easily treat themselves as well as their families in the hospital
 shikha raay ne ravivaar ko unke ward greater kailash main safai karmchaariyon ke saath mulaakaat kii or unase safai se jude kaamon ke bare main jaankaree lee
 During this, he appealed to the sanitation workers to contribute to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dream Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
 unhone kaha ki desh ko saaf rakhane main safai karmchaariyon kaa ahm yogadan he or khud piem modi is baat ko kai baar kah chuke hai
 During this, Shikha Rai asked the cleaning staff to come on duty regularly as well as on time
 shikha raay ne safai karmchaariyon se kaha ki jab bhi wo duty par aaen to puri vardi pahanen jisase unki pahchaan sunishchit hoti he or apane kaam ke prati jimmedaari kii bhaavana jaagti he
 During this, some sweepers told of the compulsion not to have uniform, then the Leader of the House assured that uniforms would be provided to all regular and daily salaried sweepers soon

 The BJP has expressed its displeasure that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has responded to questions raised by the opposition in an all-party meeting about FDI in retail, which is completely inappropriate
 rajyasabha main bhaajapa ke upanetaa eses ahaluwalia ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘sarvadaleey baithak ke 48 ghante guzar gaye hai
 Meanwhile, last evening Pranab Mukherjee spoke to our senior leader LK Advani over phone and wanted to know the scope of the amendment in the language of the moratorium proposal on retail FDI
 ’unhone kaha ki adwani ne unhen bataaya ki sarvadaleey baithak vipaksh ne jo sawaal kiye the, un prashnon kaa jawaab pradhanmantri ne sansad kii bajaae saarvajanik manch se de diya he, isliye sarkaar sansad kii kaarywahi chalaane kaa maarg prashast karne ke liye apane nirnay ko waapas le yaa phir kaarysthgan prastaav ke tahat is vishay par charchaa kara ke sansad kii bhaavana ko sweekaar kare
 There will be no change in the language of the adjournment motion
 bhaajapa netaa ne kaha, ‘is vishay par sushamaa swaraj ne bhi beeti raat sansadeey kaary mantri pawan kumaar bansal se baat kii thi, lekin unhone (bansal) kaha ki abhi kuch tay nahin ho sakaa he
 Ahluwalia said, "we have proposed adjournment according to the rules of Parliament
" agar sarkaar bahumat main he to vah matdaan se kyon ghabara rahi he
 Ahluwalia said that retail business is a state subject, while FDI is a subject under the central government
 khudara kaarobaar par koi bhi nirnay karne kaa adhikaar rajyon kaa he
 If the states feel that FDI is necessary in the retail business, then they will contact the Center
 lekin is vishay par kisi rajya ne centre se sampark nahin kiya or ekatarfa dhang se nirnay le liya gaya
 When asked about the stagnation in Parliament on the eighth day, the BJP leader said, "it is the job of the government to ensure that the proceedings of the Parliament run smoothly
" bhaajapa, rajg or puraa vipaksh sansad chalaanaa chahta he or charchaa karnaa chahta he
 But why the government refuses to vote is beyond comprehension
 ’unhone kaha ki multi brands khudara kshetra main pratyaksh videshi nivesh kii anumati diye jane kaa sabhi vipakshi dalon or sarkaar main shaamil kuch partiyon tak ne virodh kiya he, lekin sarkaar ne deshhit ke khilaaf ekatarfa dhang se sansad satr ke dauraan yah nirnay kiya he
 Describing the 'bharat Bandh' of traders as completely successful, he thanked all those involved in it

 bhartiya chayankartaaon ne pehle hi team kaa khaakaa taiyaar kar liya he or 17 sadasyeey team unke vichaaron kii jhalak he
 The presence of Sanju Samson and Karn Sharma in the squad indicates that an additional wicket-keeper batsman and potential third spinner bowler and all-rounder are being considered for inclusion in the team
 haalanki ab bhi yah sawalia nishaan he ki paanch maichon kii maujuuda vanade shrinkhalaa main in donon yuvaaon ko kitne maukey milte hai
 The main reason for this is that the team currently has a lot of contenders for the middle order and the spin all-rounder

 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni haalanki chaar tej gendbaajon ko utaarne ko lekar shankaa main hai kyonki isse over gati par asar padegaa
 It will be interesting to see if Dhoni goes down with two spinners, ignoring the situation in Bristol as he did not bowl Binny in the practice match against Middlesex on Friday
 bhubaneshwar kumaar or mohammad shami ne abhyaas match main chote spel main gendbaaji kii, jo darshata he ki team prabandhan unhen vanade antarrashtriya maichon ke liye tarotaaja rakhana chahta he
 Both of them are the first choice in the fast bowling attack but the option of the third bowler is open
 yah binni sahit umesh yadav, mohit sharma or dhaval kulkarni main se koi bhi ho saktaa he
 The Indian team would not like to get down with five bowlers as batting would be affected in such a situation and only six batsmen including Dhoni would be left in the team

 In the practice match against Middlesex, Team India tried 11 batsmen and Raina landed as the last batsman
 team india is match main ol out ho gai
 But Rayudu smashed 72, while Kohli also scored a half-century

 Former Australia captain Michael Clarke believes that Indian captain Virat Kohli is the best batsman of all-time in ODI international cricket
 kohli abhi test or vanade main vishwa ke number ek ballebaaj hai
 Under his leadership, India created history by winning the Test and ODI series in Australia ( # indvaus # indvsaus)
 isse pehle bhartiya team ne tii20 shrinkhalaa baraabar karai thi
 In this way, India has become the first team that did not lose the series in Australia and in the meantime Kohli has consistently performed well

 After seeing what he achieved for India, i have no doubt about it
 kohli ne ab tak 219 vanade main 10,385 ran banaae hai
 This includes 39 centuries
 unka ausat 59 se bhi adhik he
 Kohli's fan Clarke said that there is no answer to the passion of this 30-year-old cricketer
 unhone kaha ki aapako apane desh ke liye jeet darj karne ke viraat ke junun kaa sammaan karnaa hoga
 Yes he has aggression but no one can question his commitment
 vah vanade main sarvshereshth he
 While Kohli continues to make achievements, his predecessor captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has a different opinion on the current form
 dhoni ab vanade main pehle kii tarah aakraamak style se nahin khelte hai
 But Clarke believes that this 37-year-old former Indian captain should be left alone to play his game
 clark ne kaha ki dhoni jaanata he ki kisi paristhiti main kis tarah se khelnaa he
 He has played more than 300 odis, so he knows how to play his role
 # Stat Alert: King Kohli has made 9 centuries in his last 19 innings
 Here are some batsmen who have made 9 or fewer centuries in their entire career: k Pietersen (125 innings) s Watson (169 innings) Steve Smith (94 innings, 8 tons) Michael Clarke (223 innings, 8 tons) pic

 clark se poocha gaya ki dhoni ko vishwa cap main ballebaaji kram main koun se number par utaarna chahie, unhone kaha ki chaar, paanch yaa chah kisi bhi sthaan par
 He is capable of batting at any number and i think Virat will use him according to the circumstances
 clark ne haalanki kaha ki vartmaan main nilambit hardik pandya england main hone vaale vishwa cap main bhartiya abhiyaan main ahm bhoomika nibhaayenge
 The former Australia captain said that a talented player like Hardik is very important to balance the team
 vah keval apni ballebaaji se match jita saktaa he or mujhe vishwaas he ki vah vishwa cap team kaa hissaa hoga

 Everybody forgets the corruption, scams of UPA and are asking whether you like Modi or not? i cannot comment on whether the doubts raised by Advani ji have gone away or not

 You call Rahul Gandhi a fool, but this fool turned out to be very clever
 jab se ve upaadhyaksh bane hai, party ko karnataka main jeet mili or ve congress kii chhavi badalane main kaaphi had tak safal rahe hai

 karnataka main vot kaa vishleshan karnaa chahie
 On Twitter, you keep questioning Rahul but the reality is that ever since Rahul became Vice President, he is making new strategies
 congress abhi yah tak to tay nahin kar pai he ki chunaav agle saal karwaane hai yaa aktubar main
 You are seeing the dreams of elections in October because the Congress has already said that elections will be held in 2014 itself
 ve aakhri vakt tak nahin bataaenge ki chunaav aktubar main karwaanaa chaahate hai
 Why did Modi call himself a Hindu nationalist? They could also be called Indian nationalists
 modi se kisi ne sawaal poocha tha ki ve hindu rashtravaadi hai? unhone kaha ki haa, hindu bhi hum or rashtravaadi bhi
 He only made a statement
 aapaki niti yah he ki hindu vot bank ek ho jaae or muslim vot bank bant jaae?bilkul
 i believe gather Hindu vote bank, distribute Muslim vote bank
 dharm ke naam par raajnneeti desh ke liye khatarnaak he?aisi raajnneeti kyon nahin honi chahie? ham 80 fisadi hindu hai or agar 14 pratishat musalamaanon main se 7 pratishat hamaare saath aa bhi jaaenge to yah khatarnaak kaise ho jayega

 Smith has become the youngest cricketer to be awarded the 'ellen Border Medal'
 ‘ellen border medell’ saal ke sarvshereshth cricketer ko diya jaataa he
 Young cricketer Sean Abbott has been awarded the Bradman Award for Best Young Cricketer of the Year
 abt kaa bounsar lagane se hi november 2014 main cricketerphilip husebehosh ho gayi the or do din baad aspataal main unki maut ho gai thi
 Explosive batsman Glenn Maxwell was named T20 Cricketer of the Year
 seen abt ko saal kaa yuva cricketer, jesan beharndorf ko saal kaa gharelu khilaadi or meg lanning ko sarvshereshth mahila cricketer ko diya jane vaala ‘belinda clark medal’ se sammanit kiya gaya
 Smith not only performed in the last one year but also in odis
 unhone maaikel clark kii anupasthiti main bharat ke khilaaf haal main samaapt hui border-gavaskar trophy main team kii safal aguwai kii thi or is dauraan khud unhone shandaar ballebaaji kaa najaara pesh karke chaar maichon kii siries main chaar shatakon kii madad se 769 ran banaaye the
 This enabled him to beat David Warner by four votes in the race for the best Test cricketer
 jahaan tak ekadivasiy maichon kii baat he to smith ne is satr ke shuru main dakshin africa ke khilaaf perth main 12wein khilaadi ke rup main shuruyaat kii thi lekin iske baad jab unhen mauka mila to unhone peeche mudakar nahin dekha
 Smith recently scored three centuries in odis which became the basis of awarding him in odis
 smith ne is avasar par centurian main dakshin africa ke khilaaf banaaye gayi shatak ko sarvshereshth qaraar diya
 He said, 'I think the first Test victory against South Africa was fantastic
 duniya ke sarvshereshth tej gendbaaji akraman ke saamne centurian main shatak jamaana vastav main bejod tha
 Smith was not the only T20 winner to be awarded to the national team

 desh main notebandi lagu hone ke baad bainkon ne seaving bank main jamaa rakam par byaaj kam kar diya he
 State Bank of India, the country's largest state-run bank, lowered interest rates by 4 percent
 jaahir he seaving acount main padaa aapkaa paisa ab behatar ritern nahin de paaegaa
 In such a situation, you can earn twice as much from a savings bank by investing in a liquid fund
 kya he liquid fund?choti avadhi ke liye nivesh vaale fund ko liquid fund kehete hai
 It is also known as money market fund
 liquid fund ekkam avadhi main adhik riternpaane ke liye behatar nivesh vikalp he
 However, like any other mutual fund, some risk is also present in this fund
 lekin is fund kii sabase khaas baat yah he ki yahaan aap 1 din se lekar 1 saal tak kii kisi bhi avadhi tak nivesh kar sakate hai
 The best benefit of investing in this fund is that you can get your remaining salary invested per month
 fund se baahar nikalne par koi penalty nahiliquid fund se apana paisa kisi bhi samay baahar nikaalane par aapako kisi tarah kii koi penalty (eczit lod) nahin adaa karnaa padataa he
 On the other hand, if you join a mutual fund or withdraw your investment, then you have to pay a fee, which is called a load
 nivesh par mil saktaa he 8 fisadi tak riternfinancial maamalon ke jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki alag-alag liquid fund main nivesh par 8 fisadi tak ritern mil saktaa he
 At the same time, only 4 percent returns are available in any bank's savings account
 jab bhi desh main mahangaai badhati he to sabase zyada khatra isi baat kaa rahata he ki kendriya banksevings par interestkam kar de jisase aapaki bachat or kam ho jaati he
 Even during inflation, liquid funds promise to give you better returns
 24 ghante main waapas mil jayega aapkaa paisaliquid fund kaa ek sabase bada phayda yah he ki aap sirf 24 ghante main ise bech kar apana nivesh kiya hua paisa waapas paa sakate hai
 For example, if you want to withdraw your money in the liquid fund on Monday evening, then just call to sell it and your money will directly go to your bank account as soon as the bank opens on Tuesday morning
 haalanki is nivesh ke saath-saath bazaar main kisi bhi nivesh main apana jokhim hota he
 Do not invest in any fund based on mere news
 kisi bhi fund main nivesh karne se pehle puri jaankaree kar len athwa apane vittiya salaahkaar se raay lekar hi nivesh karen

 hamaari duniya main vaise to rhite hand (daane haath) se kaam karne waalon kii bahutayat he
 Even right is taken as right and left is taken as wrong
 bachapan se hi hamen sikhaaya jaataa he ki ham rhite hand se khaanaa khaaen usee haath se likhane kii koshish bhi karen
 The number of left-handed users is also relatively small
 duniya ke 90 pratishat log rhite hand se hi likhte hai
 Only 10 percent of the world's people are leftists
 iskaa yah katai arth nahin he ki left hand kaa istemaal karne vaale kisi bhi tarah se kamatar hote hai
 However, there is a general belief that left-handed workers are abnormal and weak
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki parents left hand kaa istemaal karne vaale students ke saath kai baar roak-tok to kai baar sakhti bhi baratate hai
 There is another aspect to this matter
 is bich kuch aise research or fact hamaare saamne aae hai jo puraani avadharanaon ko puri tarah dhwast kar detii hai
 This research proves that people using left hand are more talented
 kai diggaj bhi is fehrist main shaamil hai
 Such as Mahatma Gandhi, Barack Obama, Amitabh Bachchan, Bill Gates, Ratan Tata, Saurabh Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Nicole Kidman, Angelina Jolly, Karan Johar
 lekin kya aap is baat se waakif hai ki in lefti celibrities ko bhi kai baar kai tarah kii samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 So let's know about some of the merits and problems associated with left hand
 
 
 cricket se lekar tamaam duusare khelon main lefti hone ke apane phaayde hai
 People using left hand are better in sports like boxing, tennis
 ab sindhu ko haraa kar rio olympic 2016 main gold medal jeetne vaala marine ko hi dekh len
 Left-handed people have higher IQ levels
 neuyork kii saint laurence uniwarsity kii ek study ke mutabik daayen haath ke logon ke mukaable baayen haath waalon kaa aikyuu level 140 se adhik hota he
 People working with left hand are sensitive
 jo log hameshaa hi left hand ko upyog main laate hai unke haathon mengajab kii tejihoti he
 Left-wingers have the ability to recover from a stroke-like problem faster than the right man
 ve teji se badalati awaajon ko zyada aasaani se sun sakate hai
 Right handies are ahead of the people in terms of earning and spending money
 aisa nahin he ki left hand waalon kii duniya main sab-kuch acha hi he
 They also face many problems in everyday life
 aakhir kya hai unki samasyaayein
 
 
 It is difficult to write on the bench-chairs made in the school because the yerights are made according to handlooms
 spiral bound kaapiyon par likhnaa kaaphi mushakil hota he
 Scissors are difficult to move
 aamtaur par offis main computer kaa mouse rhite said par hi hota he or left handed logon ko ise har baar apane hisaab se left kii ore karnaa padataa he
 Playing guitar is not easy for left-hander people
 left hedend log kisi or insaan se haath milaane se pehle soch main pad jate he or kai baar to adatan left hend hi aage badha dete hai
 Scripts such as shorthand have trouble writing
 tachascreen mobilaya ypad par tip karnaa aasaan nahin hota
 It also seems difficult to use a tin opener
 credit card or swip mashine left handed logon ko dhyaan main rakhkar nahin banaai gai hai
 Ink pens are difficult to write
 pariksha dete hue yaa kabhi saath baithkar likhte hue bagal vaale se haath takaraane kii samasya bhi aam he
 People always ask you by surprise that hey you're a lefty, makes you feel different
 kisi ke saath agal-bagal baithkar khaanaa khate hue bagal vaale se haath takaraane kii samasya aapako or saath vaale ko pareshaan karti he

 The government and UP police officers are carrying out a new exercise to deal with the soldiers who have come out in support of the constable arrested in the murder of Vivek Tiwari, the manager of Apple in Uttar Pradesh's capital Lucknow
 blike riban baandhakar virodh jataane ke baad sipaahiyon ne virodh karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 However, there is no news of this protest yet
 sipaahiyon ke virodh karne ke turant baad rajya sarkaar ne 25 hajaar se zyada consteble ko pramotion diya tha
 25,091 constables have been promoted as head constables in the state
 mana ja rahaa he ki yah kadam sipaahiyon kii naaraazgi dur karne ke liye uthaaya gaya he
 The constable of UP police has been demanding this for a long time
 iske alaava, upi police kii ore se lakhanu jone main tainaat consteble ke liye rifressure or training seshan shuru kiya ja rahaa he
 In this, soft skill training is being given to about 6 thousand constables to improve communication with people
 yah kavayad bhi vivek tiwari hatyakand or isamen shaamil sipaahi prashanth choudhary par liye gaye ection se faile asantosh ko rokane ke liye kii gai he
 Earlier, the top officers of UP police tried to give a message to the protesting soldiers by taking action on them
 do din pehle is maamle main virodh jataane vaale do consteble- keshav dutt pandey or mohammad shaadaab ko suspend kiya gaya tha or 11 pulisavaalon ko police line se atech kiya gaya tha
 They also included a sub-inspector

 whatsapp messages were being forwarded in this regard

 confederation of ol india treders (CAIT) ne china se aayaat hone vaali vastuon ko lekar gambhir chintaa jataai he
 CAIT said that there is a possibility of hawala trading in large quantities, due to which the Chinese goods are cheaper in the market and the government feels a lot of custom duty and tax
 CAIT ne yah bhi sawaal uthaaya ki kahin hawala kaa yah paisa pakistan ko aatanki gatividhiyaan chalaane ke liye to nahin diya jaataa he? is vishay kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue CAIT ne sarkaar se maang kii he ki is maamle ke sabhi pahaluon kii gaharaai se jaanch kii jaae or doshi logon ko pakadaa jaae
 There is a connivance of Indian port officials somewhere
 CAIT ne kaha ki china se aayaat hone vaale saamaan kaa laagat se bhi kam mulya kaa bill banakar aata he or usee ke anusaar us par duty or ijiasti lagati he
 This leads to huge loss of revenue to the government
 CAIT ke rashtriya adhyaksh bisi bharatiyaa or rashtriya mahaamantri praveen khandelwal ne kaha, ‘hamaare desh main china se aayaat hone vaala zyaadaatar saamaan behad kam mulya kii billing par aata he
 In many cases, something comes up and its bill is something else, due to which the minimum duty and IGST is imposed on it
 ’unhone kaha ki yadi aayaat hokar aane vaale saamaan or bill main likhe saamaan kaa milan kiya jaae to pataa lagegaa ki donon main kitna fark he
 Keeping this in mind, there is a need for very tight monitoring of goods coming from China at Indian ports
 bharatiyaa or khandelwal ne yah bhi kaha ki is maamle main emporter ke saath hi vibhinn vibhaagon ke adhikariyon kii mileebhagat hoti he, jiske kaaran behad aasaani se yah vyapaar lambey arse se chal rahaa he
 This is not only spoiling the Indian market environment, but has also created a crisis for the security of the country
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki jo log china se maal mangate hai or us par ijiasti dete hai, unako kaayade se ijiasti kaa input credit lenaa chahie, lekin yadi is maamle kii chaanbin kii jaaegi, to pataa lagegaa kii kisi ne bhi input credit clem nahin kiya he, kyonki wo sara maal bazaar main bina bill ke bech diya jaataa he or is vajah se ye maal sasta ho jaataa he
 At the same time, domestic products pay full tax, due to which sugar is expensive than goods
 unhone kaha ki yah maamla desh kii suraksha se bhi judaa he
