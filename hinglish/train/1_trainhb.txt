 ab rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke pramukh mohan bhagwat (mohan Bhagwat) ne kaha he ki yadi sarkaar ke kadam dagamagaate dikhenge to sangh kii ore se unhen sakaaratmak drushkin se salaah va suzav die jaaenge
 Pt of Kanpur dinadayal upaadhyaay sanathan dharm vidhyalay main chal rahe sangh shiksha varg main bauddhik satr ko sambodhit karte hue kaha bhagwat(mohan Bhagwat) ne kaha, jo loktantric vyavastha se chunakar aate hai, unke paas adhikaar bahut hote hai
 This does not mean that these rights are misused
 haa, agar sarkaar ke kadam dagamagaate dikhe to sangh unhen sakaaratmak salaah degaa'
 Let me introduce myself to you first
 main 10 saal kii hum
 My name is Anita and i live in Delhi
 mere teacher ne mujhe ek aise project main fansaa diya he jisase mujhe kaaphi jujhna padaa
 He asked me to write an essay on the picture of the Indian economy after 20 years i
e
 in 2032
 yah to arthshaastri bhi nahin jaanate or unhone 10 saal kii bacchee se isaki ummid laga lee
 i showed intelligence and asked my economist mother
 unhone kaha, ''net par dekho
 Search will be found
 adhiktar arthshaastri bhi yahi karte hai
 "I am telling you what i found
" meri mummy ne bas kuch chijen samajhane main madad kii, baaki sab kuch net par maujuud hi tha
 First thing, every country's income is in a different currency
 inaki tulana karne ke liye unhen america dollar main badal diya jaataa he
 There are two ways to do this, according to an official exchange rate or PPP (purchasing Power Parity) exchange rate
 jaise-jaise bharat vikaas karegaa, dollar ke mukaable rupaya majboot hota jayega
 But beyond that economists do not know how exchange rates will be
 na hi unhen us vakt kii mahangaai kaa hi koi andaja he
 That is why they do everything according to the present value of the dollar
 bharat 2032 main duniya kii teesri sabase badi arthvyavastha ho jayega, jisaki kul aay 7 trillian dollar hogi (aaj yah 2 trillian dollar he)
 China at number one and America at number two will be far ahead of it, though India's earnings may increase if the rupee becomes stronger
 duusare, bharat kii aabaadi dedh arab ko paar kar jaaegi or yah china ko pachhad degaa
 That means the income of 7 trillion will be distributed among more people
 tisare, bharat kii prati vyakti aay 4,500 dollar hogi (abhi yah 1,400 dollar he)
 i asked my mother whether this would make India a developed economy
 He said that "developed" would be the wrong word for this, India would not be "developed" by 2032
 vah tab bhi garib hi rahegaa, haalanki aaj se kam
 The bus will move from the lower middle income group to the upper middle income group
 iskaa matlab mujhe tab tak samaj main nahin aayaa jab tak maine yah nahin pataa kar liya ki jordan or turkmenistan kii prati vyakti aay aaj utani hi he jitani us samay bharat kii hogi
 i had no idea that these countries would be richer than India
 mujhe is baat kaa bhi andaja katai nahin tha ki 2032 main ausatan bharat aaj ke china se bhi garib hi hoga
 Fourthly, there will be many differences within India and the trenches that are today will not be cut off
 chandigarh, goa, pudducheri yaa dilli main jeevanaster (prati vyakti aay) aaj ke viksit deshon jaisaa ho saktaa he, lekin jharkhand main aaj ke bangladesh jaisi garibi hogi
 Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Odisha will still have a lot of poverty
 paanchavin baat, garibi rekha naam kii ek cheez hoti he yani jivit rahane ke liye nunatam aay
 Today, around 30% of Indians are below the poverty line (everyone presents their own figures)
 yah 2032 main 10 fisadi se kam hoga
 That is, Indians will be less poor, better educated and more healthy
 chhathvin cheez, adhik se adhik log bhartiya shaharon main rah rahe honge or rashtriya aay main krishi kaa hissaa kareeb aath fisadi hoga
 Some people will still be doing farming but more people will be seen contributing towards industries and service sector
 kareeb 40 fisadi bhartiya shaharon main rah rahe honge or 10 lakh se zyada kii aabaadi vaale kareeb 70 shahar honge
 The population of Delhi will be 40 million, where i live
 main to soch bhi nahin sakati ki dilli tab kisi dikhegi
 i think Delhi will spread to neighboring states - Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana
 us vakt tak sadaken or yatayaat itnaa behatar ho jayega ki agra, chandigarh yaa jaipur pahunchane main sirf do ghante lagenge
 i feel that Mumbai can also be reached in four hours by high speed train
 saatvaan, tab jhepadpattiyon kaa kya hoga? garibon or mahangaai kaa kya? main to aaj bhi pani ke liye logon ko ladate dekhati hum
 Many have no electricity
 ho saktaa he tab behatar skool (virtual bhi ho sakate hai) or behatar swasthya sevaayen hon
 Infant mortality will be 15 (at 1,000 children)
 har bachche kaa tikaakaran hoga or koi bhi baccha tab ghar main nahin janmega
 But i think people will still fight for water and the weather will change from moment to moment
 kya tab ham dilli main garmi main adhitam taapmaana 50 degree celsius tak jhelenge? khayr, ham sab ke paas yuidi hoga or sarkaar ko pataa hoga ki koun garib he taaki unhen hi sabsidi di ja sake
 Everyone else will pay the money and eat, and i feel that everything is Rs 350
 kilo ho jaaegi
 Electricity also Rs 15
 unit ho jaaegi
 Our earnings will be more, but everything will become more expensive
 chunki main achche skool main padhati hum or shaayad aage kii padhai ke liye america jaaun, isliye itnaa to pakkaa he ki lautakar mujhe acchhee naukari mil jaaegi
 Now i cannot say anything about others
 us samay hamamen se kai log job market main naukari khoj rahe honge or naukariyaan utani hongi nahin (meri mummy ne mujhe yah kah kar bhram main daal diya ki sabko naukari mil jaaegi, bas hoga itnaa ki sabake vetan main ausatan kam ijapha hoga)
 But i am asking another question
 maan lete hai ki garib thik se rahenge kyonki sarkaar use sabsidi degi
 Assume that Amir will also be well because he will get a good job with good salary
 lekin jo bich main honge, kya ve 350 ru
 Will be able to buy kilo food and Rs 15
 unit bijli ke liye chukaa paaenge? mummy ne kaha ki chintaa na karo
 According to him, real income growth is always positive and it is more than inflation
 aathvin baat, mere dost adit ne ise padhaa or paariwarik jivan or kariyar ke bare main poochne laga
 i did not write about her because i do not know her
 itnaa jaanati hum ki main shaayad dilli ke alaava kisi anya shahar main kaam karuungi or baaki log bhi apane-apane janmasthan se dur hi kaam kar rahe honge
 i know that the job will be uncertain and i change the job
 main jaanati hum ki main der se shaadi karuungi, yaa phir na bhi karun
 i also know that Adit will also face difficulty in getting married
 lekin uskaa maamla alag he
 He has come from that part of the country where he has killed all the daughters
 main jaanati hum ki main saal main ek baar se zyada apane mata-pita se nahin mil paaungi
 If i happened to be in any metropolis, i know that i would have a lot of trouble finding domestic help
 us samay, main khud apane mata-pita ko sarkari mahakme main fanse hue dekhuungi
 For example, there are still many tasks that they have to run to tackle
 mujhe nahin lagata ki is tarah kaa sara kaam digital ho sakegaa
 If i was given the choice of whether i wanted to live my parents life or my imagination, i would choose my own life
 mujhe lagata he ki mere paas bhartiya hone par garv karne ke apane mata-pita se bhi kahin zyada kaaran honge
 And if i get married, i hope that my daughter will also say all these things when asked to write such an essay

 But few people are able to pay attention to the fact that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel did a big job of adding Article 370 to the Indian Constitution
 us samay puri congress party kashmir ko vishesh darja dene ke sakht khilaaf thi, lekin jab pandit nehru america main the, tab patel ne party ko kashmir ke halaat samajhaae or samvidhan sabha mendhara 370ko sweekrut karaayaa
 Nehru always credited him for work even after Patel's death
 patel ke mishan dhara 370 kaa puraa varnan unke nijee sachiv or patel ke patron ke sankalan ke sampadak ve shankar ne diya he, iske alaava mukyamantriyon ke likhe patr main nehru bhi iskaa zikr karte hai

 shankar ke mutabik -1
 One notable achievement of Sardar regarding Jammu and Kashmir was that he added Article 370 to the Constitution of India, which explains the relations of the State of Kashmir with India
 2
 All this work was conducted by Gopalaswami Iyengar in consultation with Sheikh Abdullah and his cabinet with the support of Pandit Nehru
 nehru us samay america main the
 3
 congress party ne samvidhan sabha main is masaude kaa joardaar, balki hinsak dhang se virodh bhi kiya kyonki yah anuchhed kashmir rajya ko ek vishesh darja praapt karata tha
 4
 siddhant kii drushti se congress party kii yah raay thi ki kashmir ko unheen moolbhoot vyavasthaaon arthath sharton ke aadhaar par samvidhan ko sweekaar karnaa chahie, jin sharton par or rajyon ne use sweekaar kiya
 5
 sardaar nahin chaahate the ki nehru kii anupasthiti main aisa kuch ho jisase nehru ko nicha dekhnaa pade
 So in the absence of Nehru, Sardar took up the task of convincing the Congress Party to change its attitude
 6
 He did this with such success that this article was not much discussed in the Constituent Assembly nor was it opposed
 7
 After incorporating Article 370 into the constitution, Sardar wrote to Nehru on 3 November 1949, informing him about this - 'after a long discussion, the party (congress) was persuaded to accept all the changes
 ’8
 Nehru always gave due credit to Sardar Patel for this task
 sardaar patel kii mrityu ke baad jab shyama prasad mukherjee ne dhara 370 khatm karaane ke liye andolan chhedaa, tab 25 july 1952 ko mukhyamantriyon ko likhe patr main nehru ji ne patel ke kaary kii yaad dilaai, ‘yah maamla 1949 main hamaare saamne tab aayaa tha jab bharat ke samvidhan ko antim rup diya ja rahaa tha
 Sardar Patel then took up the matter, he gave special, but transitional status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir in our constitution
 yah samvidhan main dhara 370 ke rup main shaamil he
 'many people often forget that while taking a very aggressive stance on Kashmir issue, they cannot be more nationalistic than Sardar
 agar sardaar ne kashmir ko khaas darja khud apane haathon se diya to jarur us samay ke halaat aise rahe honge

 deepika na keval aaj sabase badi bhartiya abhinetri hai, balki ek aisi shakhsiyat bhi he jo is katha ko desh-duniya tak pahunchaa sakati he

 Senior BJP leader Oom Mathur was asked if the party would take action against Subhash Barola, and he only said that the law would do its job

 The Medical Commissioner of ESIC Dr SR Chauhan is arguing that in July 2014 the rule was changed that if the kidney and cancer are old merged and the card is new, then ISIC will not cure
 tippaniyan Sona Devi, 38, of Rohini is also the new victim of ESIC

 iesaisi ke medical kamishnar dow esaaar chouhan daleel de rahe hai ki july 2014 main niyam main badlaav kiya gaya ki kidney or cancer agar purana marz he or card nayaa to ilaaj iesaisi nahin karegi

 The husband's card is from October 2013, while dialysis started the next year ie 2014, that too twice a week
 sona ke pati pramod factory main kaam karte hai or kehete hai ki koi chaara nahin
 Cannot get treatment because the cost of the month is 30 thousand
 ab to patni nae niyam kii bhent chadh jaaegi, mar jaaegi
 Another plea of ESIC is also about forgery
 haalanki jaankaron ke mutabik farji maamalon kii aad main duusare marijon ko suvidha se maharoom nahin kiya ja saktaa
 At the same time, there is also the question that an employee can get the card made, but when a disease starts, how will it be detected? The issue is not just about the New Testament, the issue is related to the breath of the breath and the question is about life and death

 For the first time in 69 years after the formation of Israel, an Indian Prime Minister has visited Israel
 pichley 69 saalon main desh ne ek ke baad 15 piem dekhe lekin koi pradhanmantri isroyal jane kii himmat nahin dikhaa paaya or iske peeche badi vajah desh kii raajnneeti or arab deshon ke saath hamaare sambandh rahe hai
 In fact, even before Modi, if Indian Prime Ministers had ever thought of embracing Israel, two thoughts would have stopped it
 One is the bitterness about Israel in the minds of Muslims, so how to stand with Israel and on the other hand 80 million Indians If workers are working in Arab countries, then on the lines of 70s, Arab world should not be against those who support Israel
 ek ahm vajah ye bhi thi kicongress israelke gathan ke vichaar ke hi khilaaf thi
 The Congress remained in power in the country for most of the time and the Congress always felt that increasing relations with Israel would mean pandering to Arab countries, and relations with Israel would also distance Muslims living in India from the party, that is, a point of diplomatic relations
 Also joined the vote bank of domestic politics
 bijepi ko nahin padegaa koi fark!duusari taraf bijepi ke liye muslim vot bank koi myne nahin rakhata he
 The 2014 election results are proof of this
 2014 ke chunaav main congress ko 37
 On the other hand, BJP got 60 per cent Muslim votes but got only 44 Lok Sabha seats, on the other hand BJP won 282 seats whereas it got only 8
 4 fisadi muslim vot mila
 The threat of Muslim vote bank! By the way, the fear that Muslim vote bank may be spoiled by increasing ties with Israel was also raised during diplomatic relations, when on 23 January 1992, the Union Cabinet approved to make diplomatic relations with Israel
 us vakt tatkaaleen maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri arjuna singh ne chetaya tha ki cabinet dekh le ki isse kahin muslim vot bank na chhitake
 This was mentioned by the then Foreign Secretary JN Dixit in his memoir
 ovaisi ne uthaaya savamb videsh niti badal rahi he to muslim netaa sawaal bhi uthaa rahe hai
 AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi said that in the world, only two countries have been formed on the basis of religion, Pakistan and Israel
 ovaisi ne kaha ki aisa pehali baar ho rahaa he jab koi bhartiya pratinidhi dal isroyal ja rahaa he or bina philistan gaye laut aayega
 Owaisi said that India's policy has never been this way
 piem modi kii is harakat se isroyal philistin ko or zyada dabaayega
 The question of Owaisi has its place but the truth is that the new line of relationships is erasing the old line
 videsh niti main nai paramparaayen sthapit ho rahi hai
 Hope should be kept that India's interests will remain paramount in this

 After the year 1980, Rajesh Khanna's phase began to end, and finally he too joined politics like many of his contemporaries and was elected as MP on the Congress ticket from New Delhi seat in the 1991 Lok Sabha elections

 ek wo ladki thi, jise asaram kabhi apni potee samaan bataaya karte the or ek ye ladki he, jise wo apni beti samaan bataa rahe hai lekin sitam dekhie ki ye donon hi ladkiyaan naa to asaram ko dada samaan maanane ko taiyaar hai or naa hi pita samaan balki donon hi asaram ke khilaaf ilzaamon kaa wo pitara khole baithi hai, jo har roj unki museebataan badha rahaa he
 In the Ahmedabad police inquiry, Asaram tried to play a new bet in front of the police by calling the girl who filed a rape report against him as a daughter
 police sutron kii maane to somvaar kii raat jodhpur se ahmedabad laae jane ke baad aties ke daftar main chali qareeb dhai ghante kii poochtacha main asaram ne kaha ki wo apane khilaaf report darj karwaanevaali ladki ko pahachaanate tak nahin hai, kyonki unke ashram main bahut si ladkiyaan rahati hai
 Now the question arises that the girl whom Asaram is referring to as his daughter, after all, why is the same girl accused against Asaram such a serious charge? That too when many years have passed for this incident and that girl is living a happy life with her whole family
 to asaram ke paas is sawaal kaa bhi jawaab he
 Asaram also called the statements against Sonia and Rahul Gandhi in the Ahmedabad police's inquiry as the reason behind these allegations
 lekin jab asaram ke baton kii sachai jaanane ke liye police ne unka laai ditection test karwaane karwaane kii baat kahi, to asaram ko neend aane lagi
 Asaram said that he is very tired and now he wants to sleep
 jaahir he, laai ditection ke sawaal ko asaram apni pehali poochtacha main to taal gaye, lekin abhi chaar dinon kii police remand main asaram ko aise ek nahin, dasiyon sawaal kaa jawaab dena hoga
 Earlier, after being brought to Ahmedabad, the police formally arrested him at eight o'clock at night and said that if he wants to inform anyone of his arrest, he can give it
 is par asaram ne apane vakil ko khabar bhijwai
 The Ahmedabad police read out the rape report lodged against him in Surat around 1 o'clock the night before the interrogation, while Asaram kept trying to speak to the police officers continuously before he could formally record his statement

 Indian cinema has now moved its steps towards choosing international subjects
 desh main gandhi kii gambhir vyakhya or ‘munnabhai’ kii tapori vyakhya ke baad ab mulat: dilli main banaai gai film ‘dear friend hitler’ main itihaas ke sabase vivaadit charitra hitler ko kahani vishaywastu banaaya gaya he
 The film's co-producer and actor Nalin Singh said, 'we have chosen controversial characters like Hitler as well as Subhash Chandra Bose and Gandhi as the plot of the film
 puri film ek saath teen trek par chalati he, jiske jariye dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan ke hulchalon se bhare aitihaasik ghatnakramon ke jariye gandhi ke darshan kii vaishvik praasangikta ko ubhaara gaya he
 He said that this film with historical references based the letter of Subhash Chandra Bose, written to Hitler, who was supportive of meeting Hitler and taking part in the fight against the Allies to end British rule
 singh ne kaha ki aise samay main jab puri duniya main hitler ke hinsa ke raste kaa bolbalaa tha tab gandhi ne ahimsa ke anokhe prayog ko apanaaya
 The film also mentions Gandhi's letter in which he condemned Britain as well as Hitler
 unhone aazaadee ke liye ahimsa ko hathiyaar ke rup main upyog kiya jo gandhi ke raajnneetik kad ko or unchaa karata he or aaj kii vaishvik raajnneeti main unhen praasangik banaata he
 Famous actor Raghuvir Yadav is playing the role of Hitler in the film, while the famous actress Neha Dhupia plays Hitler's girlfriend Eva Brown
 hitler kaa dimag kahalaane vaale or unhen bhaashan kala kaa abhyaas karaane vaale goabals kii bhoomika main khud nalin he
 Abhijeet Dutt plays Gandhi
 abhinayta aman verma ne aaazaad hind fouj ke sainik kii bhoomika nibhaai he
 Bhupesh Pandya, a graduate of the National School of Drama, plays Subhash Chandra Bose, who has given an impressive color to Subhash Bose's vigorous speech in the film
 film kii avadharana, uski patakatha lekhan se lekar uske liye lagbhag do varsh tak shodh karne vaale nalin kaa kahana he ki dilli vishvavidhyalay main padhai ke dauraan unhone ek nukkad naatak karte hue hitler ke charitra ko najadik se janaa or aam logon tak uski pahunch or unke bare main jigyaasa ko dekhte hue unhone samay aane par is vishay par film banane kii sochi thi
 He said, 'the film is directed by Rakesh Ranjan and it is his first film as a director, while its producer is Anil Kumar Sharma of Amrapali Media Vision
 puri film main zyaadaatar kalakaar dilli ke hai or dilli ke upnagareey ilaake main berlin ke set ke saath saath hitler apane antim dinon main jis bunker main rahe uskaa set taiyaar kiya gaya
 Regarding Raghuveer Yadav, the famous actor who played Hitler in the film, Nalin says that Raghuveer was so lost in his character that Hitler was alive during the shooting and even after the shooting and on many small things even Hitler Tavar was alive in them, due to which many times glass breaking occurred
 nalin bataate hai ki is film ko banane ke liye mukhya chunauti yah thi ki videshi charitron kii maujuudagi ke kaaran alag alag bhashaaon kaa kaise upyog kiya jaye
 Like how it would be to show Hitler speaking Hindi
 unhone kaha ki is uljhan ko dekhte hue saare charitron ke liye ek hi bhashaa ke prayog kaa samavesh kiya gaya
 But the film will be dubbed in eight languages including French, German, Hindi, Tamil, Arabic, Bangla and will use the sub headings
 film main prasiddh gayak daler menhadi ne holi kaa geet gaaya he, jabaki pashrv sangeet jagajeet singh ne diya he
 He said that there is a lot of discussion abroad about this film and i hope that this film will do good business abroad and the sleepiness of Bollywood will break and its attention will also go towards such international subjects
 nalin ne bataaya ki film kii antarrashtriya relies 26 janvari ke aasapaas karne kaa unka iraadaa he or iske alaava vah jald hi ek or antarrashtriya vishay ko uthaane kii taiyaari main jute hai

 Meanwhile, we are telling you a news related to Asaram and Salman Khan
 haal hi main jab salmaan ko kaala hiran shikaar maamle main jodhpur jail main band kiya gaya tha
 Then the news of the actor's acceptance of Asaram was in the news
 darasal, kaha gaya tha ki jodhpur jail main salmaan or asaram kii baat hui thi or salmaan ne asaram kii ek baat maani
 Asaram had told that he told Salman that you should stop smoking cigarettes
 is par actor ne kaha ki wo ab kabhi cigarette nahin pienge
 LIVE: Asaram was convicted in a rape case by a minor, the lawyers demanded a lesser sentence of Salman Khan when he was lodged in the jail in the deer hunting case and there was an influx of those who asked for autographs
 duty thanedaar bhi unase milane pahunchate the
 But Asaram Bapu did not like this and there was news of his anger
 media reports ke mutabik, asaram baapu salmaan khan se naaraaz ho gaye the
 He told the jail staff, 'salman Khan is a celebrity, so everyone is coming to meet him
 mujhase milane to koi nahin aata
 'shera was standing in wait for the tiger, the slogan of Zindabad on the road is that Salman was sentenced to 5 years by the Jodhpur Sessions Court in the black deer hunting case
 court ne baaki aropiyon saf ali khan, tabboo, sonaali bendre, neelam kothaari ko bari kar diya tha
 This incident is 20 years old

 "" Bombay High has long been India's richest source of oil and gas in the western sea region of the Arabian Sea
 ab yah kshetra bhu-jeevashm shastriyon, jo maanate hai ki dianasaron ke abhi tak ansulajhe samuhik vinaash samet prithvi par jivan utpatti ke rahasy kii kunjee isi sthaan ke neeche chhipi hui he, ke liye dilchaspee kii nai oonchai chune vaala ban gaya he
 This theory has been put forward by geologist Shankar Chatterjee at Kolkata-born Texas Tech University and his opinion is being widely agreed
 ve us ulkapind kaa shandaar najaara pesh karte hai jo 40 kimi chaudaa tha or 6
 50 million years ago, collided in the same place where Mumbai High is today
 yah visphot sari duniya main maujuud parmaanu hathiyaaron ke kul jakhire ke dhamaake se 10,000 guna shaktishaalee tha
 This created tsunami waves and fierce volcanic eruptions that covered the sunlight for nearly a year and destroyed half of the species, including dinosaurs, at the time
 chatarji kaa mat he ki iske prabhaav ke kaaran everest parvat jitani oonchai vaala gaddha paidaa hua jo ab pani ke neeche he or jiskaa naam unhone srijan or vinaash ke devtaa ke naam par shiva rakhaa he
 Due to the collision, Mahavinashchatharjee says with confidence, this is not a fanciful scientific fiction, but we have understood and achieved it on that occasion
 unka maananaa he ki sambhawatah is takaraav ke kaaran hi samuhik vinaash jise ke-tii (critasius-tershiri) kehete hai, hua
 His arguments are contrary to the commonly held notion of deluge
 anek vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki dianasoron kaa vinaash mexico ke eukatan prayadweep ke tat se dur chikasulab ke gahvar ke kaaran hua
 But some scientists at Princeton University, USA, recently rejected this recognition because evidence showed that meteorites collided there some 300,000 years before the destruction of dinosaurs
 princeton vishvavidhyalay main bhu jeevashm vigyaan kii professor gerta keller dwaara haal main kiye gaye anusandhan se yah tathy saamne aayaa ki ke-tii boundari-ek vishesh bhugolic pahchaan jo ke-tii vinaashkaal ko prakat karti he-se 3,00,000 varsh purv chikasulab kii ghatana hui thi
 Thus the Chiksulab effect cannot be linked to the destruction of dinosaurs
 unka kahana he ki jwalamukhiyon kaa visphot hi dianasoron ke vinaash kaa mukhya kaaran he or is prakaar ve chatarji ke daawey ko bhi sweekaar nahin karatin
 Revealed the cause of the destruction of dinosaurs: Chatterjee, who presented his overall hypothesis at the recent annual meeting of the Portland Geological Society of America in Oregon, argues, with the argument that even when lava was flowing south, dinosaurs flourished in India Were living
 bharat main hamen dakshini lave ke pravahon ke bich talachat vaali parat main dianasoron kii haddiyaan or unke andey surakshit mili hai
 Thus it may be that due to the pollution related effects in the south there has been an environmental crisis but it cannot be the main reason for the destruction of dinosaurs
 apratyaksh taur par dakshini jwalamukhi mahasaagaron ke tejabikaran ke liye jimmedaar rahe ho sakate hai jisase samudri praaniyon kaa bhojan nasht ho gaya
 But Shiva's influence seems to be the closest reason for the destruction of the dinosaurs
 takaraav ke baad bana shiv gahvarashiva gahvar ke anusandhan se vaigyanikon ko aashaa he ki ve prithvi ke jivan or is grah ke itihaas se judi ahm ghatnaon ke bare main zyada jaan sakenge
 If this cavity was the result of a catastrophic confrontation, it may help to explain why so many breeds were destroyed in the KT incident
 or isse bhugolic itihaas se jude ke-tii boundari kalkhand kii khanij sanrachana par bhi roshni pad sakati he
 According to Chatterjee, in a decade-old study based on his new evidence that 70 percent of species perished from collisions, the Shiva cavity shows that the meteorite collided at the same time as the supernatural destruction of the creatures and created a destructive force that caused the Earth to land And 70 percent of the sea's flora and fauna community was destroyed
 iske falswaroop jaahir he ki chikasulab ek halke hathodenuma chot se paidaa hui gadde jaisi rachana he jo bade takaraav se pehle kii he
 Chatterjee based his evidence on geophysics as well as geology and geophysics samples collected by the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation in the Mumbai High Region
 is soochna ko ve rekhganitiya punarrachana or shiva gahvar, jo samudr kii gaharaai main boond ke aakaar kii rachana he or lagbhag 600 guna 400 kimi kshetrafal kii he, kii aayu nirdhaarit karne ke lihaaj se kaaphi mahatvapurn maanate hai
 But before Shiva, the largest cavity was the Vredfort in South Africa, which is surrounded by 300 km
 arab sagar main maujuud is mahagavar kaa vyas lagbhag 500 kimi he, haalanki vaastavik gahvar ko talachat ne dhak rakhaa he
 Shiva's influence changed the earth's crust to steam, saying that he has succeeded in mapping it based on the geographical evidence collected
 aisi jal pralay kii kalpana karnaa kaaphi kathin he
 If his belief is correct, the impact of Shiva on the occasion of the collision turned the earth's crust into steam and left nothing on the earth other than the terrifying hot matter
 aisa lagata he ki isi ke prabhaav se bharat ke pashchimi tat ke duusari ore 30 mile moti grenite kii sataha kaa kaaphi kuch hissaa nasht ho gaya
 This collision may have triggered terrible continent lava flows, such as the southern trough and associated volcanic eruptions that cover large parts of western India
 iske parinamswaroop bahut thode samay main bharat ke pashchimi hisse main lava kii bahut badi maatra kaa pravaah hua
 Not only did the volcanoes of Hua Volcano be born, the island of Seychelles broke from Indian soil and moved back to Africa
 chatarji spasht karte hai, shiva ke prabhaav ne bharat ke pashchimi tat ko bhugarbheey drushti se sakriy bana diya
 Chatterjee goes on to say, and the Shiva missile spanned about 25 miles
 is aakaar kaa ulkapind jaise hi takaraayega vaise hi vah ek vishaal gahvar bana degaa
 The mountains will turn into steam and dust and debris will cover the atmosphere which will cover the sun
 laal tapate hue pahaado kii akaash se barish hogi jisase duniyabar main jangalon main bhayanak aag lag jaaegi or tejabi barish hogi jo samudr ke kathor aavaran vaale jeevon ko nasht kar degi or khaadya shrinkhalaa ke bhayankar vinaash kaa kaaran ban jaaegi
 Some scientists have even imagined that poisonous gases from southern volcanoes became the main cause of the destruction of dinosaurs
 chatarji bataate hai, ''is disha main sochane ke bahut kaaran hai ki is prabhaav ne hi jwalamukhi ke visphoton ko janm diya
 "by creating a new surface structure of the Earth, Chatterjee has put his belief in proper perspective by doing extensive research and calculating the time of coincidence

 ' In April 2019, when the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) appointed All Odisha Kinnar Mahasabha chairperson Meera Parida as party observer in the district Bhubaneswar, there was fierce celebrations among the Kinnar community, although Parida was the vice-president of the women's wing of the party earlier
 odisha ke khordaa jile kii begunia kii rahane vaali sharmila jhenpu kaa kinnar samudaay kii netaa mira paridaa banane tak kaa safar jitna dikkaton bharaa tha, utana hi dilachasp bhi
 Meera was already famous in the state, but when she was made Mahamandaleshwar Laxminarayan Tripathi of 'kinnar Akhada', she became the Mahamandaleshwar of Eastern India
 darasal isi saal prayagraj main hue kumbh main kinnar akhaada kaa gathan hua tha
 Socially politician Meera also runs a non-governmental organization 'sakha'
 sanstha main samudaay ke kai kinnar kaam karte hai
 a similar story is of Sweety Sahu of Brahmapur in Ganjam district
 sweety bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kii varisht kaaryakarta hai
 He has 30 transgenders working in his sandal factory in Brahmapur
 party main sweety kai diggaj netaaon kii kareebi hai

 jagatsinghpur jile main bhaajapa ne kinnar menka ko bataur jila upaadhyaksh niyukt kiya
 Maneka of Balikota village in the district was previously a male Prashant Parida
 gaanv se lekar yahaan tak kaa unka safar bhi samudaay ke anya logon se alahada nahin he
 His eyes get wet by telling stories about Chhedkhani caused by his gender in school
 lekin duusare hi pal gaanv ke anya logon, khaskar mahilaon ke bich apane sahyogi vyavhaar ke kaaran mili 'sweekruti' ko yaad kar unki ankhen chamak uthin
 In fact, the leadership qualities in Maneka, a man of rich personality, had developed in the village itself
 ve gaanv main dusron kii madad karne or unke chote-mote masale sulajhane ke liye mashhoor thim
 He said, "maneka, hidden within the Pacific surrounded by the gloom of gender identity, came out completely when she came to Bhubaneswar for further studies from school
 '' kaam se lekar pyaar tak kai dhokhe khaakar menka aaj yahaan tak pahunchi hai
 She is currently trying her hand at driving
 unki tej-tarraar chhavi kii vajah se hi unhen raajnneeti main haath aajamaane kaa mauka mila
 According to Meera, party observer of bjd's Bhubaneswar branch, 45 kinnars are currently in the party membership, while according to bjp's Sweety, 80 people are in contact with them who will soon be party members

 According to Sweety, the eunuchs led by the eunuchs in politics will prove helpful in connecting this marginalized community to the mainstream
 ooncha udaye kii khwahishtol geton par bheekh mangakar padhai karne vaali praachi patrkaar bananaa chaahati hai
 She is not only dreaming but is also studying Mass Communication to change her intentions into reality

 Many more eunuchs in the state are moving towards fulfilling their dreams
 sarkaar ke kadam kii saraahna bhi or suzav bhirajya ke kinnaron ne sivaiesdy (bhubaneshwar) ke sabhaagaar main 26 july ko transgender persons (protection of ritis) bill, 2019 par gahari charchaa kii
 The eunuchs from thirty districts gathered here
 is maukey par saamaajik nyaay evam divyang shashaktikaran mantri ashok chandra panda bhi maujuud rahe
 In the midst of reviewing the provisions of the Bill, a booklet 'sanction' containing the steps taken by the Government and the policies made was also distributed
 panda ne kaha ki sarkaar kinnar samudaay ko aatmanirbhar banane kii taraf bad rahi he
 In 2017, the state government enacted a transgender policy
 is das sutreey kaarykram main transgender bacchon ke maa-baap ko aarthik sahaayta dene kii baat kahi gai taaki bacchon kii shiksh-diksha behatar chale, chaatravrutti, kaushal vikaas or vyaktitv vikaas samet kai nitiyon kaa zikr he
 Sonam of Bhubaneswar says that any such initiative should be welcomed which guarantees to protect the rights of transgenders as well as make them live respectable lives like the common people and make them self-reliant
 is lihaaj se ve vidheyak ko sarkaar kii taraf se uthaaya gaya ek bada kadam maanati hai
 But the ground truth is that a year before the passage of the bill, the state government had taken many steps in the interest of the eunuchs but the benefit of this reached only a few people
 ve kahati hai, ''trainon main bheekh maangane par roak lagane ke kaaran is peshey se jude kai logon ko apane gaanv lautnaa padaa
 Most eunuchs say that before prohibiting begging, the government should have arranged employment for people engaged in this work
 ''vidheyak kii samiksha ke baad mukhya rup se chaar suzav saamne aae
 The first suggestion came from Anmul's Chinmai Das
 unke mutabik, transgenderon ko obisi category main daalkar unhen aarakshan kii suvidha di jaani chahie, taaki sadiyon se haashie par padaa yah samudaay mukhyadhara main aa sake
 The second suggestion came from Sadhana Sahu, Personality Development Officer of Keat University
 ve kahati hai ki vidheyak main gender pahchaan patr magistrate se banvaanaa padegaa
 Even though the screening committee's recommendation for a Gender Identification Certificate has been removed from the 2018 draft, the provision of a Gender Identification Certificate to be made by the Magistrate instead of self-identification is a form of the same
 pahchaan ke liye jujh rahe is samudaay ke liye yah praavdhaan madadgaar hone kii jagah apmanjanak he
 The third suggestion came from BJD leader Meera Parida
 ve kahati hai ki chaar rajyon—kerala, tamilnadu, chhattisgarh or bihar main jis tarah se gender parivartan kii surgery ke liye aarthik madad milti he, thik vaise hi odisha sarkaar ko bhi kinnaron kii madad ke liye yah aarthik yojana shuru kerani chahie
 The eunuch community of the state no longer go from house to house to congratulate the spirit of living with respect
 haa, agar kisi ne khud unhen ghar par khushi ke avasar par bula liya to manaa bhi nahin karte
 Here eunuchs do not see begging on trains and squares
 bhubaneshwar yaa odisha ke anya shaharon main gaanv-giraanv se kinnar apane liye darje vaali jindagi kii talash main aate hai
 In fact, in rural society, eunuchs are still seen as associated with the traditional profession
 aise main vahaan sammanjanak jindagi jeena kathin he
 Come to the city and do some studies and some jobs
 kai log apane pasand ke partner ke saath rahete hai to kai shaadi bhi karte hai
 Look at Meghna Sahu living with her family in Bhubaneswar

 They are happy

 Many other eunuchs who joined the political party along with Meera Parida joined the BJD in the state and are the inspiration for this community to move ahead in politics, from Shabnam Mausi, the famous Kinnar celebrities in the country to Gorakhpur Mayor Asha Yadav
 Let's show passion sweety kahati hai, ''siyasat hi nahin balki anya kshetron main bhi deshbhar ke kinnar ke kisse inke bich charchaa kaa vishay bane rahete hai
 From Tamil Nadu actress, fashion icon and painter Kalki Sabrahmanyam to first transgender judge Jyota Mondal and lawyer Sathiyashree Sharmila, first transgender police officer Preethika Yasini, people in different fields have raised hopes that every field will now Kinnar society is reaching high
