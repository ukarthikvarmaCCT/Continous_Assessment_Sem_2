 Due to this, both Rahul and the party are troubled
 rahul gandhi ne kumbharam lift yojana ko kumbhakarna lift yojana kah diya, jiske baad pandal main hansi ke thahaake gunj pade
 In fact, Rahul wanted to mention the Kumbharam lift canal project for fresh water, enumerating the development works done in Jhunjhunu district by the previous Congress government, but he called the Kumbhakaran lift scheme instead of Kumbharam lift canal scheme
 kumbhakarna lift yojana? kumbhakarna to phir bhi 6 maheene sota tha, congress 60 saal tak soi rahi or desh ko vikaas se itane varshon tak vanchit rakhaalpiche

 Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley said on Thursday that the 1975 emergency would have failed if it had been internet
 jetali ne yah baat ucch sadan meninternetpar kuch sarkari niyamon ko nirast karne ke liye laae gaye ek prastaav par bahes ke dauraan kahi
 Marxist Communist Party (CPI) leader P
 rajeev ne rajyasabha main subah soochna praudyogiki (madhyasth dishanirdesh) niyam-2011 ko nirast karne ke liye ek prastaav pesh kiya
 These rules, implemented since April 2011, have largely been seen as indirect censorship of internet content
 yah niyam apeksha rakhata he ki ve sabhi madhyavarti jointernet, doorsanchaar, i-mail athwa bloging sevaayen uplabdh karaate or sibar cafe chalaate hai, unhen un saamagree ko hataanaa hoga, jo mote taur par nuksaandaayak, sataanevaali, nindaatmak, ashleel, apmanjanak, niztaa bhang karne vaali, ghrunit athwa rangabhed se sambandhit, jaateey taur par aapattijanak, dhan ugaahne athwa jua khilne ko badhaava dene vaali athwa kisi bhi rup main avaidh hai
 Taking part in the debate, Jaitley mentioned that the 1975 Emergency would have failed if the Internet had been there at that time
 jetali ne kaha, ‘us samay yadi internet astitv main hota to apatkaal asafal ho gaya hota
 The BJP leader said, "you can control the print and electronic media but not the internet
" internet kaa prasar itnaa vyapak ho chukaa hota ki dehshat samaapt ho jaati
 While objecting to the rules made by the government for the Internet, Jaitley said that words like blasphemous, derogatory can be misused
 unhone kaha, ‘koi vyakti meri athwa meri party kii aalochana kar saktaa he, yah mere liye nindaatmak ho saktaa he lekin kya yah mujhe kehane kaa adhikaar he ki 'internetpar roak laga do'? in shabdon ko jis tarah gadha gaya he, usase inke bhavishya main galat istemaal kii ashanka he
 Jaitley said that internet content could be personally offensive
 bhaajapa netaa ne mazaakia lahaze main kaha, ‘sabhi apmanjanak saamagree par roak laga dene se hamaare paas ek bahut hi ubaau internet hoga

 ) asthai nilamban se mushkilon main ghire bhartiya mukkebaaji mahasang (iabf) ke liye ummid kii kiran jaagi he kyonki antarrashtriya mukkebaaji sangh (eibie) ne pratibandh hataane ke liye use dobaaraa chunaav karaane or apane samvidhan main badlaav karne ko kaha he
 Brigadier PK Muralitharan Raja, Senior Vice President of the IABF, AIBA President in Yerevan, Armenia, Dr
 ching kuo vu se mulaakaat ke baad kaha ki nilamban ‘adhik samay tak nahin’ chalegaa
 The AIBA suspended the Indian Boxing Federation on Friday in view of the International Olympic Committee's ban on the Indian Olympic Association and the 'possible manipulation' of the IABF election in September
 raja ne kaha ki iabf jab eibie ke nirdeshon ko puraa kar legaa to mukkebaaji kii vaishvik sanstha ioe par lage pratibandh ke hatate hi us par laga nilamban bhi hataa degi
 He said, 'I had a detailed discussion with the AIBA President who first made it clear that the International Federation is not against India
 jis tarah se kaam ho rahaa he usase ve kaaphi khush hai
 The primary reason for the suspension is the ioc's ban on the IOA and because AIBA had received some complaints about the election, they have also decided to get it investigated
 ’raja ne kaha, ‘maine unhen spasht kiya ki sitambar main hue chunaav paardarshee the or hamaare samvidhan ke mutabik hue
 The office-bearers were selected unanimously, although some people may have some complaints, but this does not mean that the elections were rigged
 ’unhone kaha, ‘eibie ne ab hamen kaha he ki ham apane samvidhan main sanshodhan karen or ise eibie ke samvidhan ke anusaar banaae
 Also, elections are held again in the presence of supervisor of AIBA
 jab ham aisa kar lenge to eibie iosi ke ioe par laga pratibandh hataane ke saath hi hamaara nilamban bhi waapas le legaa kyonki yahi hamaare nilamban kaa praathmik kaaran he
 According to the AIBA constitution, the Speaker cannot hold office for more than three terms but there is no limit on the tenure and age of other office bearers
 raja ne kaha ki eibie ko santusht karne ke liye iabf ko kisi bhi sarkari hastkshep se mukt chunaav karaane honge
 The IABF received a double whammy when the Sports Ministry also revoked its recognition after the suspension of AIBA and gave it 15 days to confirm the re-election
 sitambar main hue iabf chunaav main nivartmaan adhyaksh abhaya singh chautaala ko namankit chairman ke rup main mahasang main barkaraar rakhaa gaya tha jabaki vah adhyaksh ke rup main teen kaarykaal puure kar chuke the
 Chautala has also been elected President of the IOA despite the suspension of the IOC
 chautaala ne kaha ki iabf eibie ke nirdeshon par charchaa ke liye jald hi aam sabha kii baithak karegaa or bhavishya kii karrwai par faisla karegaa

 After the removal of Article 370, the first interview of the Home Minister, in a special conversation with aajtak, placed his talk on 370 after the removal of Section 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, the first interview was given by Aaj Tak, the President of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Union Home Minister Amit Shah
 tivi today network ke news diarector rahul kanwal se baat karte hue grih mantri amit shah ne kaha ki meraa maananaa he ki 370 ke kaaran jammu-kashmir main vikaas nahin ho paaya tha, rajya main kaaphi bhrashtachar hua tha
 No one was responsible for this
 anuchhed 370 hatane ke baad ab vahaan neeche tak vikaas pahonchega
 There is not even a curfew in the state, Amit Shah said that after the removal of Article 370, there is a peaceful situation in Jammu and Kashmir
 rajya main ek bhi jagah karfu nahin he
 Section 144 is installed in only 6 police stations
 seb kaa kaarobaar aaraam se chal rahaa he
 Road traffic is going on
 masjidon main log prarthanaayen bhi kar rahe hai
 Shah said that people should die, it is better that some people stay in jail
 dhara 370 ke kaaran 40 hajaar log maare gaegrih mantri ne kaha ki ghati main seb kaa vyapaar bhi thik chal rahaa he
 Mobile service has also started from today

 He said that 370 caused corruption in Kashmir
 anuchhed 370 ke kaaran hi rajya main 40 hajaar log maare gaye
 Numerous elected leaders used to take advantage of the possible violence in the state after the removal of Article 370, Amit Shah said that some mps had said in Parliament that there would be bloodshed, bloodshed would flow after the verdict
 magar jammu-kashmir main aisa kuch nahin hua
 Due to 370, there was nothing good for the people, few selected leaders were benefited from 370, this has now become clear

 Only three countries in the world have raised selective questions on the removal of 370
 baaki puri duniya 370 hataane main bharat ke paksh main rahi he or mana he ki ye bharat kaa aantarik maamla he
 This is a major diplomatic success in India

 Sen said AICCTU leader Gangaram Kaul was fighting for tea plantation workers in Assam and was allegedly murdered by Congressmen on March 25
 sen ne daawa kiya, ‘‘ghatana ke baad rajya main band rahaa or 1 april ko pradesh ke mukhyamantri ne rajya vidhansabha main sibiai jaanch kaa vaada kiya tha
 But it was over a month and a half and the Chief Minister did not get time to send a formal letter to the investigating agency

 aayojakon ke anusaar do din tak chalane vaale adhiveshan main unionon ko apni baat rakhane kaa paryaapt mauka diya jaataa he or sen ko is prakriya kaa paalan karnaa chahie
 The incident happened in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh when Subhash Sen, secretary of the Assam unit of All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU), intervened with the speech of Labor Minister Mallikarjun Kharge
 khadge ne union netaa ko rokane kaa prayaas kiya
 He started giving a speech at the conference held at Vigyan Bhavan that Sen stood up from his seat and slammed an employee, referring to the incident
 sen ne kaha ki eisisitiu ke netaa gangaaraam kaul assam main chaay bagan ke mazdooron ke liye sangharsh kar rahe the or 25 march ko kathith taur par congress ke logon ne unki hatya kar di
 Sen claimed, "the state remained closed after the incident and on April 1, the Chief Minister of the state promised a CBI inquiry into the state assembly

 dharmaveer bharti kaa kaaljayi upanyaas 'gunahon kaa devtaa' ab angreji main bhi uplabdh hoga
 Penguin has brought its English translation under the name 'chander and Sudha'
 is amar prem kahani kaa anuwaad kiya he patrkaar punam saxena ne
 'god of Offenses' is one of the earliest read novels
 isamen prem ke avyakt or alokik rup kaa shandaar chithran he
 Chander, the protagonist of the story, falls in love with Sudha, but Sudha's father's blessings and his ideals together create conditions that he cannot speak to Sudha
 sudhaa kii najaron main vah devtaa bane rahanaa chahta he or hota bhi yahi he
 Ultimately, her association with Sudha is the same as that of a deity and a devotee
 prem ko lekar chander kaa dwandv upanyaas ke zyaadaatar hisse main bana rahata he
 The result is that Sudha gets married elsewhere and eventually has to leave the world
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav 2017 ke nateezon main bijepi ko 403 main se 312 siton par jeet ke saath prachand bahumat mila
 After a long time, a party got such a majority
 vah bhi aisi party ko jo centre main sattarudh he
 In such a situation, all the political hurdles that prevented Uttar Pradesh, which had lagged behind other states in the direction of economic development, were overcome
 is prachand bahumat ke baad bijepi ne rajya ke teevr vikaas ke liye thri siem (1 mukhyamantri or 2 upmukhyamantri) kaa formula tay kiya
 Yogi Adityanath was made the Chief Minister of the state and Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma became Deputy Chief Ministers
 is thri siem vaali sarkaar ko ek saal puraa ho rahaa he lihaaja yah jayja lene kaa sahi vakt he ki bijepi kaa ye formula kitna kargar sabit hua
 bjp's Three CM Experiment in Uttar Pradesh is also considered special because this formula will be very effective for running the administrative activities in the largest state of the country
 vahiin teen mukhyamantriyon ke formule se bijepi rajya main jaateey ganit ko bhi balance kar sakegi
 While Keshav Prasad Maurya will keep other backward castes, Dinesh Sharma was expected to practice Brahmins in the state
 vahiin mukhyamantri adityanath jati ke aadhaar par bijepi ke duusare kshatriya netaa bane jisane rajya kii kaman sanbhali, lekin unhen jati se pare rakhte hue rajya main hindutv kaa sandesh dene kii ummid unase rakhi gai
 How effective the three CM formula has been in handling the caste equation in the state will be determined by the results of next year's Lok Sabha by-elections
 lekin rajya main achche din laane main yogi sarkaar kitni safal hui he iskaa akalan kiya ja saktaa he
 Read this: a year later, Chief Minister Yogi gave the Gujarat model of development to UP
 After the civic elections of Uttar Pradesh, an important meeting of the Sangh was held in Lucknow to review the tenure of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 mukhyamantri awaas par hui is baithak main yogi or unke donon upmukhyamantriyon ke saath-saath rajya party adhyaksh mahendra nath pandeya or aresas se dattatreya hosbhole or krishna gopal shariq hue
 In this meeting, the main objections against the Yogi government by the union were the cases of bureaucracy in the state, corruption in some ministries, administrative negligence in the development schemes run by the central government, including differences in state government and party officials
 satta ke galiyaaron main yah bhi daawa he ki ek saal ke dauraan uttar pradesh main mukhyamantri karyaalay rajya main sucharu vyavastha ke liye apni team kaa gathan puraa nahin kar paaya he
 It seems from this that the responsibility of implementing the GST implemented in the state in July 2017 was the responsibility of Chief Minister Adityanath himself
 lekin is kaam ke liye lage vibhaag main yogi sarkaar ne satta sanbhaalane ke baad koi pherbadal nahin kiya he
 Therefore, after a year of functioning of this department, it is still the responsibility of the same officers who were appointed during the tenure of former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 ise padhein: yogi kii branding se modi ke gujarat jaisaa chamakegaa upi? jaaniye kya he plansangh kii baithak ke dauraan doosraa ahm mudda afasarshahi kaa rahaa
 It is also claimed in the administrative circles of the state that IAS Raj is actually running in Yogi Raj
 jahaan sheersh raajnneetik netritv ko jaateey balance or sucharu prashasan ke naam par pruthakkar pesh kiya gaya he
 At the same time, the reality is that Chief Minister Yogi is paramount in the state and the three CM formulas have no contribution in the smooth administration
 yah isi vaastaviktaa kaa asar he ki sarkaar main party kii koi sunwaayee nahin he, mantralayon main afasaron kaa varchasv he or sangh tak lagaataar is gatirodh kii report pahunch rahi he
 So, it can be said in such a situation that if the three CM formula is brought in Uttar Pradesh for smooth administration, then at the moment it does not seem to be successful in its cause

 It is also learned that Chinese spies are taking help of ISI in this work

 Last week, a village sarpanch Dorje Stanzin received a similar call

 He later informed the authorities that it was revealed that the phone was made through a computer
 sarpanch kii shikaayat ke baad pataa ki gaanv main or bhi logon ke paas aise phone aa rahe hai
 Security agencies involved in the investigation, security agencies have started investigating after such incidents in border areas

 isi dauraan kahani main kai saare utaar chadhaav aate hai, jisaki vajah se sultan kii personal or profeshnal jindagi kaaphi prabhavit hoti he or aakhirkaar ek khaas vajah se khud ko sabit karne ke liye sultan ek ahm raceling ladata he, dilli kaa bijnesaman akaash (amit saad) or coach (randeep hooda) uski vaapasi ke liye kaaphi madad karte hai
 Now is Sultan able to prove himself to the world? You will be able to know this only by going to the theater
 scriptfilm kii kahani to resler kii jindagi par aadhaarit he lekin filmakan ke dauraan kaaphi lambii lagane lagati he, silsilewar kai sari ghatnaayen ghatati jaati hai, jo vartmaan or flashbek ke saath guzarati hai
 There is also a bit of boredom after Interval, which is why the film could have been even more crisp with editing
 haalanki loketions or cinemetography kaabil e tarif hai
 Salmanaki's presence makes the film even more visible
 fite sikvence kamaal ke hai saath hi cinemetography jabardast he
 actingsalman Khan, seeing the physical changes, seems to have worked hard for the film and also appears on the screen

 At the same time, Anushka Sharma has also played the character of 'arfa' well and gets a lot of screen action
 film main amit saad, randeep hooda or baaki sah-kalakaaron kaa kaam bhi acha he
 Salman and Anushka's Haryanvi dialogues are also a compliment
 kamjor kadifilm kii kamjor kadi isaki lambaai he
 The film could be shortened and crisped by editing it well
 vaise to film kii kamai bahut hogi kyonki 5 dinon kaa weekend mila he lekin us hisaab se film ko or bhi zyada cat tu cat banaaya ja saktaa tha
 The music of the musicfilm is good

 The title track fills energy throughout the film
 kyon dekhensalmaan kii maujuudagi,romaanchak fite sikvence or sultan kii kahani ke liye jarur dekhi ja sakati he

 How and when Baba Kedar was established and when the beliefs described in Baba's Darshan Puranas, after the battle of Mahabharata, when the Pandavas felt great grief over the killing of their own brothers, they came to this land of Kedar to repent
 Arrived, it is said that this temple was established by him

 It is said that when the Pandavas came here, Lord Shiva was upset with them, they did not want the Pandavas to see them, but the Pandavas were insistent on seeing Lord Shankar
 yahi kaaran tha kii shiv ne nadi rup dhaaran kar liya tha
 As soon as Lord Shiva started going to the Hades to hide from the Pandavas, the Pandavas caught the back part of the Lord's river form, but by then Lord Shiva had gone to half Hades, since then the previous part of the Lord was worshiped in Kedar
 And his mouth form is worshiped in Nepal as Pashupati Nath Temple

 He said- When the name of the book is Beyond the Dream Girl, then both of them had to be mentioned in the book
 log sochate hai ki ham kis tarah kaa relation share karte hai
 Let me tell that whenever there is a need, Sunny is always together
 jab wo haadasa (hema malini kaa 2015 main hua car accident) hua tha, tab sani sabase pehle mujhe dekhne pahunche the
 They take care of everything
 jis tarah se wo sabaki care karte hai, yahi dikhaata he ki hamaara rishta kaisaa he
 dharmendra-hema's love story, Dream Girl had told how to talk till the wedding that Hema Malini's birthday is also on 16 October
 hema ne dharmendra se 1979 main shaadi kii thi
 Dharmendra was already married and had four children
 kaha jaataa he ki dharmendra kii pehali patni prakaash cor hema se nafrat karti hai, isiilie unke bachche bhi hema ko pasand nahin karte hai
 Till date, none of the Deol family had disclosed how Hema's relationship with Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol was, but at the book launch, Hema did so
 hema malini kii biography 'biyond da dream girl' somvaar ko unke janmdin par launch kii gai

 Hema Malini said, Deepika is lucky to be working with a filmmaker like Sanjay Leela Bhansali
 iske jawaab main deepika ne kaha, 'sanjay sar ne mujhe teen alag-alag tarah ke kirdaar nibhaane ko die
 Leela, Mastani and now Padmavati
 main vaaki unke saath kaam karke khud ko lucky maanati hum
 Even after reaching this stage of life, his stardom does not seem to be less, otherwise there are many such actresses of his era who have gone anonymous
 lekin hema malini ke liye bhi is mukaam tak pahunchnaa aasaan nahin tha
 Early in his career, the director rejected Hema Malini by saying that there was no star appeal in his face

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley answered several questions in the ninth session in the evening on the second day of the sixth edition of 'agenda Aajatak', the great platform of Hindi world
 satr main jetali se jab sawaal kiya gaya ki kya is chunaav main bijepi ko zyada mehnat kerani pad rahi he, pichley baar ke chunaavon ke mukaable

 In the earlier elections too hard work is done
 badi jeet ke liye koshish kar rahe hai
 Do not want to leave any stone unturned
 jetali ne congress par gujarat ko baantne kii koshish karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 He said that the Congress has run an anti-development campaign for the elections in Gujarat in the first 15 days
 maine jivan main kabhi aisa campan kahin nahin dekha, jisamen vikaas ke liye ghrinaa karne vaala campan chalaaya gaya ho
 It was a foolish campaign
 iske chalate baad main unhen ise chhodana padaa
 But after this, the Congress is on an even more dangerous agenda
 jetali ne kaha ki congress ne 1985 main jaateey aadhaar par saamaajik dhruvikaran kar gujarat ko baantne kii koshish kii thi
 The BJP has freed Gujarat from that agenda and put Gujarat on the development agenda
 ab congress ek baar phir vahi karnaa chaah rahi he
 But the BJP will not let the Congress divide politics succeed

 It is a case of a police station
 ant main ek pisiar vine main hamane apni dost ko daalaa
 None of the people standing there helped him
 sambhav he log ye soch rahe hon ki unke haath main khun lag jayega
 The police did not help in mounting the friend in the van as his body was bleeding heavily

 People remained tamasbeen
 The friend of the deceased girl told that along with the police, nobody gave us clothes nor called an ambulance

 'he told that on requesting to cover the body several times, someone gave a piece of bed sheet
 unhone bataaya, ‘vahaan khadey logon main se kisi ne hamaari madad nahin kii
 People were probably afraid that if they help us, they will become witnesses of this incident and later they will have to visit the police and the court
 ’kisi ne kapade tak nahin dieunhone bataaya, ‘yahaan tak ki aspataal main hamen intjaar karnaa padaa or maine vahaan aate-jate logon se sharir par kuch daalane ke liye kapade maange

 yahaan tak jaanavar bhi jab apana shikaar karte hai to ve apane shikaar se is tarah kii krurta ke saath pesh nahin aate
 The friend of the deceased girl said, "my friend endured all this and he told the magistrate that the accused should not be hanged but should be burnt to death
" ’sahi tha peedita kaa pehla bayaanunhone bataaya, ‘meri dost ne esadm ko jo pehla bayaan diya vah sahi tha
 My friend gave her statement after much effort
 bayaan dete samay vah khans rahi thim or unke sharir se raktasrav ho rahaa tha
 There was neither any pressure nor interference to give the statement, but when the SDM said that there was pressure on them while recording the statement, i felt that all efforts were in vain
 mahila esadm kaa yah kahana ki bayaan dabaav main darj kiye gaye, galat he
 'police should take necessary steps quickly
 When asked if such an incident does not happen again, what would he like to suggest to ensure that
 is par unhone ne kaha, ‘police ko yah hameshaa koshish kerani chahie ki peedit vyakti ko jitani jaldi sambhav ho aspataal pahunchaaya jaae
 Police should not find a government hospital to admit the victim
 saath hi gavaahon ko bhi pareshaan nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Burning candles will not change the mentality
 He said that one cannot change one's mindset by burning candles
 unhone kaha, ‘aapako sadak par madad maang rahe logon kii sahaayta kerani hogi
 'he said,' The protest and demonstration should be not only for my friend but also for the coming generation
 ’peedita ke dost ne kaha ki sarkaar dwaara gathit justise verma samiti se vah chaahate hai ki vah mahilaon kii suraksha or behatar karne or shikayatakarta ke liye aasaan kanoon banane ke liye upaay sujhaaye

 'he said,' i stayed in the police station for four days, while i should have been in the hospital instead
 maine apane doston ko bataaya ki main durghatana kaa shikaar ho gaya hum
 "he said," In the case the Delhi Police should assess itself whether it has done a good job or not
 ’unhone kaha, ‘agar aap kisi kii madad kar sakate hai to uski madad kiijie
 If one person had helped me that night, you would have had some other picture in front of you
 metro stesan band karne or logon ko apni baat kehane se rokane kii koi jarurat nahin he
 The system should be such that the trust of the people is maintained
 ’unhone bataaya, ‘haadase kii raat main apni dost ko chhodkar bhaagane ke bare main kabhi nahin sochaa
 In such a time, even animals will not leave their companion
 mujhe koi afsos nahin he, lekin meri ichha he ki shaayad uski madad ke liye main kuch kar paaya hota
 Sometimes i wonder why i didn't auto, why took my friend to that bus

 ek hafte ke bheetar sena or aatanki sanghathan, donon hi ek baar phir surkhiyaan batorne main kaamyaab rahe hai
 The only difference is that this time the reason for discussion has been two completely different incidents from each other

 Defense Minister A

 Antony's recent statements suggest that these allegations of wife-swapping have already been proved and that is why he has spoken of taking steps to punish the culprits
 yahaan tak ki in bayanon se pehle hi media ko dekhne-sunne vaale halkon main yah charchaa shuru ho gai ki nausena main to is tarah kii baaten hoti rahati hai
 Like most cases focused on and related to the army this time too, most of us have made our hasty conclusions before the completion of the investigation process
 lekin is puure vaake ko ek kahani kahin zyada dilachasp bana detii he or vah kahani he ek nausainya afasar kii barkhaastagi kii
 He was sacked for "accusing his fellow officer's wife of becoming affectionate"
 haasyaaspad dhang se taiyaar kiya yah aadha-adhuraa vaakya darasal sena main ek dandaneey aparaadh he
 My conclusions about this plot are based on three levels of understanding about military forces
 mere andar maujuud ek sainya afasar kii patni ko gaharaa sadma laga he, andar maujuud langik samanta kii pairokaar aaropee ke khun kii pyaasi he, jabaki meri academik ruh tivi par or akhabaaron main is vishay par chal rahe ‘‘faujee-drame’’ ko dekh rahi he
 In the political discourse that the mainstream media has started, terrorism has been introduced with great frills
 yahi baat sainya maamalon main dikhti he
 The Indian Army is known in the social circles for its balanced and noisy nature
 aazaadee ke lambey arase baad tak sena kii gatividhiyon or usase sambandhit soochnaaon ko samaaj ke bade hisse tak pahunchane kii koi aadhikarik vyavastha nahin thi
 Apart from the ranks and medals, British officers left the legacy of Akad and Hikrat leaving India
 baad main usee akad ko rashtriya suraksha se jod diya gaya
 For these reasons, the lack of awareness about the army, speculations and misconceptions began
 vakt ke saath halaat or kharaab hue kyonki sena ne bhi aam logon ke saath ek sidhaa sampark banane main dilchaspee nahin dikhaai
 The nineties underwent fundamental changes in the field of public information, but the military system continued on the same old pattern
 1999 ke kargil yuddh ke dauraan pehali baar bhartiya sainya tantra khaskar army ne ek chote-se samooh ko media ke saath milakar kaam karne ke liye taiyaar kiya
 On a limited level, the army felt the need to communicate with the general public about the battle for the first time, without which it was fighting
 us vakt puraa mulk rashtrabhakti kii bayaar main baha chalaa ja rahaa tha
 The live telecasts, photographs of the martyred soldiers and their relatives in mourning created the same scene, which Professor Suvarna Chatterjee of the University of Delhi called the "theater of Tributes"
 haal main kashmir main bhartiya seemaa kshetra ke bheetar pakistani sainikon dwaara do bhartiya sainikon ke sir katkar le jane vaali ghatana kaa bhi aisa hi kawarej kiya gaya tha
 The effect of exaggerating these sporadic activities of the army by the media is dangerous
 isse jang kaa maahaul taiyaar hota he
 It may be that there are many layers of this matter, whose truth can be revealed with the passage of time
 yadi navy adhikari kii patni kaa aarope sahi sabit ho jaataa he to nishchit rup se uske pati or sambhavit rup se shaamil varisht adhikariyon par yon shoshan kaa maamla chalegaa
 There is also a possibility that the matter may be the result of a bitter experience related to marriage
 donon hi sthitiyon main navy kisi-na-kisi prishth bhoomi main rahegi hi
 It is yet to be understood that even if this is a case of wife-swapping (which does not match the allegations made by the wife), there is no rule in the army for this
 sena vastav main bahut roodhiwaadee he or yah baat sena kii us chhavi ke ekadam ulat he, jo bagaiyr kisi shodh or taiyaari ke banaai gai filmon or tivi serialon ne hamaare man main bitha di he
 Excessive mingling in the military is not encouraged
 is maamle ne un galatiyon ko ujagar kiya he, jo mukhyadhara media sena se judi khabaron kii kawarej ke dauraan karata he
 Its target is the entire institution rather than the people connected with the case
 vah aadhi-adhuri baton ke aadhaar par nishkarsh nikaalata he or sansanikhej shabdaawalee kaa istemaal karata he
 Recently, the names of army officers have come up in cases of corruption and violence and in every case the media has made the same mistake
 in galatiyon se sena ke bare main satahi bahasein ho rahi he or nishkarsh nikaale ja rahe hai

 algepi ke saansad or mukhiya ramvilas paswan ke bete chiraag paswan kaa naam bihar ke siyaasi patal par teji se ubharate rajanetaaon main shaamil he
 In a short span of time, Chirag Paswan has made his place in the political corridor
 ek yuva netaa ke rup main, ek sanghathankarta ke rup main or maukey ko bhaanpakar teji se faisle lene kii apni kshamta ke bal par
 Let's take a look at the journey of Chirag Paswan, who is growing his stature politically in Bihar
 chiraag paswan kii sabase badi pahchaan he unka lok janashakti party yani LJP netaa ramvilas paswan kaa putr hona
 But only the politics of Chirag Paswan cannot be judged from so many times
 aaj ke vakt main chiraag paswan bihar kii siyasat ke prabhaavshaalee shakhsiyaton main shaamil hai or na keval party balkiandie gathbandhan main bhi acchhee-khaasi sakriyatadikhate hai
 2
 chiraag paswan cinema kii glamras duniya se raajnneeti main aae hai
 He was born on 31 October 1982
 computer science kii padhai karne vaale chiraag paswan ek faisan dijainer bhi hai
 But he also tried his hand at Abhiyan's world in the film
 3
 Chirag Paswan first tried his luck in the film world
 2011 main ai film 'mili naa mili ham' se chiraag paswan ne apane filmi kariyar kaa aagaaj kiya
 For this film, Chirag was nominated for the Stardust Award in the category of 'super Star of Tomorrow'
 film chal nahin pai or chiraag paswan ke filmi kariyar kaa ant bhi isi film ke saath ho gaya
 4
 filmi kariyar flop hua to iske baadchirag paswan ne raajnneeti kaa rukh kiya
 Chirag did not face much difficulty here
 pita ramvilas paswan jame-jamaaye raajnneetijna hai or chiraag paswan ko laanching pad aasaani se mila gaya
 Today Chirag Paswan is a Member of Parliament from Jamui Lok Sabha Constituency in Bihar and heads the Parliamentary Committee of LJP
 5
 However, Ram Vilas Paswan had a difficult time when Chirag stepped into politics
 loksabhaa chunaav main party kaa khaataa tak nahin khulaa tha or khud ramvilas paswan jaise-taise rajyasabha tak pahunchane kaa jugad banaae paae the
 The party's strength in the state assembly was not enough to make any impact
 6
 Chirag Paswan joined politics in this difficult time and began to explore new possibilities for the party
 lojpa teji se alokapriy ho rahi upie ke kheme main dikh rahi thi or dharmanirpekshata ke naam par ramvilas paswan ke liye bhaajapa ke kheme main janaa mushkil lag rahaa tha
 Especially when the BJP had decided to move forward under the leadership of Narendra Modi
 chiraag paswan ne yaheen se party kii siyasat kaa rukh or raajnneetik kismat donon ko badalane vaala faisla kiya
 7
 jab nitish kumaar narendra modi ke khilaaf bhaajapa se alag ho gaye to bhaajapa ko bihar main nae saathi kii talash thi
 The LJP stood with the BJP at the same time for the 2014 general elections
 mana gaya ki ramvilas paswan or algepi ke is faisle ke peeche puri tarah se chiraag paswan kii ranneeti kaam kar rahi thi
 8
 chiraag paswan ke is faisle ne sabakuch badal diya
 The BJP got a clear majority in the elections held last year
 lok janashakti party ke 6 saansad chunakar loksabhaa pahunch gaye
 Chirag Paswan himself won the Lok Sabha membership in Jamui by defeating Sudhanshu Shekhar Bhaskar of RJD by 85 thousand votes and started a new innings at the age of 32 as an MP
 9
 This change in politics and strategy made the LJP an ally in the central government
 aaj ramvilas paswan narendra modi sarkaar main upabhokta, khaadya evam saarvajanik vitaran maamalon ke mantri hai
 10
 2015 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaav main algepi 243 main se 40 siton par lard rahi he

 "we realized the need of the hour and hired the lady bouncer," says Prashant, the pub owner
 pub main har tarah ke log aate hai

 Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee met the relatives of TMC workers who were killed in the election on Thursday

 The politics of idols and memorials has filled the date of India with strange stories
 desh ke tamaam chauraahey or tirahe murtiyon se las ho chuke hai
 In Haryana, Rajasthan people place idols of their ancestors outside the house
 kai gaanvon or shaharon main shahid javaanon kii bhi murtiyon lagaai jaati hai
 You do not get a tap to drink every ten kilometers, but you will definitely get some idol
 jinaki murtiyon nahin hai, unki sunwaayee ke liye murti−memorial insaaf cameti honi chahie
 Overall, India is an idol-dominated country, so the movement that is going on to convert 12 Tughlaq Road into former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh Memorial is an extension of this tolerance and acceptance of idols or something else
 
 rashtriya lok dal or bhartiya kisaan union ke kaaryakarta kabhi dilli kii seemaa par to kabhi tughlaq road ke raaston ko gher kar pradarshan karne lagate hai
 Is this not a new technique of forcible possession after an election defeat? isse pehle choudhary charan singh memorial ke akhil bhartiya str kaa pashchim uttarapradeshy andolan kyon nahin hua yaa media ne cover nahin kiya
 Chaudhary Charan Singh was Prime Minister for six months and could never face Parliament
 congress virdohi raajnneeti ke agrani nayakon main rahe hai
 Mulayam Singh was said to be his successor, whose party has a government in UP and Charan Singh's son's party could not win a single seat in the Lok Sabha
 ajit singh haar gaye or makaan khaali kar chale gaye, lekin unki party is bangale ko memorial main badalane kii maang lekar waapas aa gai
 non-congressism was against the idol culture in Congress politics, but its leaders also fell prey to idols
 haryana main har zile main devilal kii smriti main park bane hai, jahaan unki murti bhi he
 Haryana Chief Minister Bhupendra Hooda has constructed a grand memorial in Rohtak in memory of his father Ranveer Hooda, a member of the Constituent Assembly

 Obviously, no one has forgotten Chaudhary Charan
 bas is baar bagpat kii janata bhul gai or ajit singh ko vot nahin kiya
 Turned to Narendra Modi
 ab mulaayam singh yadav, nitish kumaar or bhupendra hooda sab is memorial andolan kaa samarthan karne lage hai
 There may be a dispute about the method, but the question will not be over if the streak starts from where the line is drawn
 ambedkar ke bayaan padhenge to aap or kanfus ho jaaenge kyonki ise samajhnaa itnaa bhi aasaan nahin he
 'hero and hero worship is a bitter truth in India's political life
 main maanata hum ki nayak puja bhakton ke liye hatotsahit karne vaali he or desh ke liye khatarnaak he
 i welcome such criticisms from which it should be known that the person whom you want to worship as great, must know about him
 ye koi aasaan kaam nahin he
 These days when the press is in hand, a great man can be easily coined through it
 ham ek aise charan par pahunch gaye hai, jahaan pocketmaron se saavdhaan jaise notice board ke saath−saath hamen ye board bhi lagaana hoga, jis par likhaa ho mahaan purushon se saavdhaan
 ' ambedkar bhi is murti puja ke shikaar ho gaye
 It is not that Gandhi Nehru did not oppose idol worship
 kiya, magar puja hui
 Nehru even wrote an article in a Kolkata newspaper called Chanakya, in which he criticized the person worshiping, but the same Nehru 1961 main tamilnadu ke mukhyamantri ke kamraj kii pratimaa kaa anaavaran karne pahunch gaye
 Kamaraj was alive then
 lekin jab diemke ne apane sansthaapak annadurai kii pratimaa banane kaa prayaas kiya to congress virodh karne lagi
 Srivatsan has written an interesting article in the Hindu on 9 November 2013 about the statue and the memorial that when the DMK came to power in 1967, the party started the work of installing idols vigorously
 jahaan jahaan kamraj kii pratimaa lagi thi, vahaan-vahaan annadurai kii bhi laga di gai
 Srivatsan has written that after Nehru's death a trust was formed to build a memorial
 jiske sachiv karn singh ne bataaya ki do saal tak ek karod rupee hi jamaa hue, jabaki lakshya tha 20 karod
 That was when Nehru was said to be quite popular

 In the twenty-first century, Mayawati increased its scale so much that the political world was shocked

 But Mayawati did not stop

 In 2000, there was a ban on converting government bungalows into memorials
 endie sarkaar ne lagaai thi
 But in 2013, the UPA government changed it and allowed the bungalow at 6 Krishnamanan Marg to be converted into Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial for the next 25 years
 kareeb do karod kiraaya bhi maaf kar diya
 When Meira Kumar became the speaker, she went to stay in the speaker's bungalow but did not leave this bungalow
 daawa tha ki is makaan main babu jagjivan ram rahete rahe isliye unka memorial bananaa chahie
 Last May, the UPA government also made a rule like the NDA that no VIP mausoleum will be built on the banks of the Yamuna

 It was in 1997, Biju Patnaik, former Odisha Chief Minister, died suddenly due to a heart attack
 biju patnayak janata dal ke ek lokapriy netaa the
 After Biju Patnaik's death, many questions were being raised about who would take the party forward
 biju patnayak ke bete naveen patnayak kii raajnneeti main koi zyada dilchaspee nahin tha
 Naveen Patnaik studied outside Odisha
 orishi bhashaa bolne main bhi unhen kaaphi dikkatein thim
 In such a situation, who would handle the party was a big question
 achaanak naveen patnayak ko raajnneeti main aane ke liye manaaya gaya or naveen raajnneeti main apana kariyar shuru karne ke liye maan bhi gaye
 After the death of Biju Patnaik, he contested the Lok Sabha by-election from Naveen Aska and won
 biju patnayak kii maut ke baad yah seat khaali padi thi
 Naveen Patnaik was also a minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government
 6 disambar 1997 ko biju janata dal kaa gathan hua
 Atal Bihari Bajpai's mind is believed to be behind this
 bajpeyi or biju patnayak ke bich achche rishte the
 The two knew each other well since the time of the JP movement
 agar odisha main trishanku asembli hoti he, biju janata dal ko purna bahumat nahin miltaa he, to phir kya hoga? aise main yah bhi ho saktaa he ki bijepi ko power se dur rakhane ke liye congress biju janata dal ko baahar se samarthan de de
 In such a situation, the Congress would not want the Biju Janata Dal to support the NDA
 duusari baat yah bhi he ki jai panda or vijay mahapaatr jaise bijepi netaaon ke saath naveen ke rishte bahut kharaab ho chuke hai
 As long as both these leaders remain in BJP, there will be some problem in explaining Naveen
 is baar pandas ne naveen par khulkar hamalaa kiya he
 Many Bijdei leaders had joined BJP before the elections this time
 isse naveen khush nahin hai lekin yah bhi dhyaan main rakhana padegaa ki apane phaayde ke liye naveen kuch bhi kar sakate hai

 purv mukhyamantriyon ko bangale aavantit karne kaa pehla prakaran varsh 1985 main aayaa jab narayan dutt tiwari mukhyamantri the
 Narayan Dutt Tiwari from Shukla, who was then posted as Secretary, Public Works and State Property Department, ordered former Chief Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh to allot a bungalow at Mall Avenue in Lucknow
 shukla bataate hai, ''chunki mal avenu main shrenee chah kaa bangala tha jo keval karyrat mantriyon ko hi diya ja saktaa tha
 So i expressed my inability to allot a bungalow to Vishwanath Pratap Singh as former Chief Minister
 zyada jor dene par unhen rajbhavan main shrenee paanch kaa bangala aavantit kiya gaya'' 1989 main pehali baar narayan dutt tiwari ko purv mukhyamantri ke rup main mal avenu main shrenee chah kaa bangala aavantit hua or yaheen se yah parampara bhi shuru hui
 In 1996, retired secretary of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly Devaki Nandan Mittal filed a petition in the High Court on behalf of his organization 'public Interest Organization' against the allotment of bungalows to the trust and former chief ministers
 mittal kaa tark tha ki trust or purv mukhyamantriyon ko bangala aavantit karne kaa koi niyam nahin he, is aadhaar par inhen fouran nirast kiya jaae
 In order to justify the allotment of the bungalow, the state government implemented the 'ex-chief Minister Housing Allotment Rules-1997' by a cabinet order and presented it in the court
 hycourt ne varsh 2001 main niyamavali kii vaidhata par koi nirnay sunaae bagaiyr mittal kii yachika nirast kar di
 Two years later, in February 2003, Shukla posted on the post of Chairman, State Vigilance Commission, retired
 agle hi maheene unhone hycourt kii lakhanu bench main vakil ke rup main apana registration kara liya
 In line with the intention of the constitution, Shukla formed an organization named 'lokprahari' in August 2003 with fellow officers retired from administrative and police service to fight the fight for improvement in politics and governance
 shukla lokprahari ke mahasachiv hone ke saath bina fees vaale vakil bhi hai
 Shukla says, "in the first meeting of Lok Prahari, members of the organization and former Director General of Police came

 Dwivedi informed the petition of Devaki Nandan Mittal regarding the bungalows to be given to the former Chief Ministers
 is par hycourt ke aadesh kaa adhyayan karne par pataa chalaa ki court ne sambandhit niyamavali kii vaidhata par koi nirnay nahin liya he
 Subsequently, in the year 2004, the first petition on behalf of the Lok Prahari was filed against the allotment of bungalows to former Chief Ministers in the Supreme Court
 ''supreme court ne yachika sweekaar karte hue rajya sarkaar ko notice jari kar diya
 The hearing on the petition began in 2014 after nearly ten years
 agast, 2016 main supreme court ne kanuunan vyavastha ke khilaaf hone par 'bhootpurv mukhyamantri awaas aavanton niyamavali-1997' ko nirast kar diya or purv mukhyamantriyon ko do maheene ke bheetar bangala khaali karne kaa aadesh diya
 After this, the then SP government arranged for legalizing the life of government bungalows to former Chief Ministers through the 'uttar Pradesh Minister (salary, Allowance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Amendment Act-2016'
 shukla bataate hai, ''hamane niyamavali main sanshodhan ko supreme court main chunauti di
 Our argument was that when all government employees-officers have to vacate the government house after the termination of service, then giving a life bungalow to former Chief Ministers is not only wrong in law but a violation of the basic rights of the Indian Constitution
 '' lok prahari ke tarkon se sahmati jataate hue court ne 'uttar pradesh mantri (vetan, bhatta or prakeern upbandh) sanshodhan adhinium-2016' ko nirast kar diya or purv mukhyamantriyon ko apana sarkari bangala khaali karnaa padaa

 lokprahari ne 'bhartiya nyaayik seva' kii shuruyaat karne ke liye yachika daayar kii he jise supreme court ne sweekaar kar liya he
 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) national president Mayawati made a clever political move when she received a notice to vacate the government bungalow as a former chief minister from the state bungalow following the Supreme Court order
 lakhanu main mal avenu ilaake main basapa ke pradesh karyaalay ke thik saamne maujuud 13-e number ke aaleeshaan bangale ke baahar 21 may kii subah 'shri kanshiram yaadgaar vishram sthal' likhaa hua ek nile rang kaa board laga diya gaya
 This was the same bungalow where Mayawati was preparing to show her bullying in UP politics again
 iske baad basapa kii rashtriya adhyaksh ne apane sipahasaalar or party ke rashtriya mahaamantri satish mishra ko mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke paas bhejkar 13-e mal avenu vaale bangale ko 'kanshiram yaadgaar vishram sthal' ke rup main sthapit karne kii purajor peshbandi shuru kii
 On the last day of the bungalow evacuation period of 15 days, Mayawati has always kept a corner of the bungalow of 13-A Mall Avenue, always a center of curiosity among the general public before moving to her private residence with address of 9 Mall Avenue
 Showed to the media
 mayawati ne pehali baar ek guide kii tarah media ko bangale main lage basapa ke sansthaapak kanshiram ke 'mural' dikhaae
 Mayawati specially showed the 'mural' in which Kanshi Ram and she herself are seen with seven great men of Bahujan society
 kanshiram ke antim sanskaar or asthi kalash ke mural dikhaakar mayawati ne yah sabit karne kii koshish kii ki 13-e mal avenu vaala bangala asal main 'kanshiram yaadgaar vishram sthal' hi he or iske ek kone main ve abhi tak rahati ai hai
 The government of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), trying to recover from successive defeats in Gorakhpur, Phulpur and subsequent Kairana parliamentary by-elections, could not immediately find any cut in Mayawati's bet
 lakhanu vishvavidhyalay main associat professor manish hindvi bataate hai, ''loksabhaa chunaav se pehle dalit voton ko sahejane main juty bhaajapa sarkaar mayawati ke master stroke ke aage naram hi rahi, jabaki mayawati bangala khaali karne ke masale par aakraamak rukh apanaakar apane kor dalit vot bank ko sandesh dene main kaamyaab raheen
 "now the state property department is preparing to divide the bungalow with 13-A mall Avenue in two parts
 ek bhaag ko 'kanshiram yaadgaar vishram sthal' ke rup main viksit kiya jayega to duusare bhaag ko rihaishi bangale ke taur par upyog main laayaa jayega
 On the other hand, as former Chief Minister, Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav, living in a luxurious bungalow on 4 Vikramaditya Marg, Lucknow, vacated the bungalow and encamped with the family in the state guest house at Mall Avenue
 sultanpur road par maujuud ansal city main taiyaar ho rahe apane nae awaas main jane se pehle akhilesh yadav roj subah lakhanu kii sadakon par cycle daudaate dikh rahe hai
 As a strategy, Akhilesh Yadav inspects the projects started in the erstwhile SP government in the capital Lucknow and accuses the BJP government of the state of being anti-development, backward
 sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav kii gheraabandi karne ke liye 8 june ko 4 vikramaditya maarg ke bangale kii chaabi milane ke agle din rajya sampatti vibhaag ke adhikariyon ne media ko bulaakar bangale main hui todfod dikhaai
 The officials indirectly tried to prove how the SP president had damaged government property
 Akhilesh Yadav says, "BJP is defaming me
 sarkaar bangale main hue nuksaan kii list mujhe saunpe, ham uski bharpai karenge
 After the Supreme Court's order, tussle has started between the ministers of the BJP government over the vacant bungalows of five former chief ministers - Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mayawati, Kalyan Singh, Rajnath Singh and Akhilesh Yadav

 Immediately after this decision, the membership of the then Rajya Sabha member Rashid Masood, Rashtriya Janata Dal president and then Lok Sabha member Lalu Yadav was terminated after being sentenced by the court
 supreme court ne lok prahari kii yachika par 16 farvari, 2018 ko apana faisla sunaaya jiske baad chunaav ladgaye vaala har vyakti ab ek shapath patr ke jariye apane or apane ashriton kii aay ke strot ke bare main jaankaree degaa

 iske saath hi shapath patr se ummidavaar ko yah bhi bataanaa hoga ki chunaav ladgaye se ayogy ghoshit karne vaali sambandhit dharaaen us par lagu nahin hoti hai
 On the plea of the Lok Prahari, the court has ordered the government to make a system of checking the assets of the public representatives whose assets suddenly increase considerably in a short time

 'cricket ke bhagwaan' kahe jane vaale sachin tendulkar ne dakshin africa ke daure par jaise hi apana 50waan test shatak puraa kiya, desh or duniya main phir se ek puraani bahes chhid gai
 Now again the question has started to be raised whether Sachin's achievements as a batsman are bigger or that of Don Bradman
 aapaki najar main sachin zyada bade ballebaaj hai yaa don breadman? isi mudde par aapke priy ankar vikrant gupta ne live chat ke dauraan da
 Your answer from Centurion of Africa
 padhenvikrant gupta kaa profile dekhenkhel ko dil se samajhnaa ho yaa dimag se, ek cheharaa jo jehan main ghumta he wo he vikrant gupta kaa
 Whether it is the nuances of cricket or the behind-the-scenes game, predicting the outcome or the state of the player's heart, Vikrant Gupta's precise analysis reveals the definition of a settled journalist
 lahore se lords, newjiland se netherlands or colombo se carabian
 
 
 Vikrant, who presents a picture of the dressing room from every cricket ground in his own style, is recognized in sports journalism as a fast-paced reporter and serious anchor
 unka sapana bharat ke liye khelnaa tha or punjab kii ranjai team tak bhi wo pahunch gaye lekin us sapane ne udaan bhari 13 saal ke khel patrakarita kariyar ke dauraan
 He felt every movement of the game and the players up close
 pehle akhbaar main unki lekhnee or baad main televijan main unke tewaron ne khel patrakarita ko alag hi aayam pradaan kiye
 From Muhammad Azharuddin to Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly to Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Vikrant has been a witness to many historical moments of Indian cricket covering many generations of Indian cricket
 2003 main dakshin africa main bhartiya team ke saath world cap main khushi ke pal bhi bitaye to 2007 main westeindies main naakaam team india ke dukh bhi saajha kiye
 Apart from historic victories in the West Indies and New Zealand after 35 years, there is hardly any aspect of Team India's tour of Pakistan after 15 years which is hiding from the eyes of Vikrant
 test cricket kii gambhirtha se lekar twanti-20 ke rang ke saath jeena vikrant kaa pesha hi nahin, shauk bhi he

 in) on Dec 12, 2017 at 10:23pm PST New Delhi: Mahatma Gandhi Gurudev was not a creative writer like Rabindranath Tagore, but his writing was expressed in different ways in different languages, including Gujarati, English and Hindi
 gujarati main jahaan gandhi bhartiya janata se samvaad karte dikhte hai, vahiin angrezi main unka lekhan british sarkaar se raajnneetik samvaad karata hua nazar aata he
 These views were expressed by the historian, writer Ramachandra Guha, during his lecture on 'foundation Day of Mahatma Gandhi: As a writer and speaker' by the Sahitya Akademi
 apni baat ke samarthan main guha ne mahatma gandhi ke lekhan ke teen udhaaharan bataate hue taarkik dhang se apni baat rakhi
 One of Gandhi's articles was related to the natural disaster, which was on the description of the Bihar-earthquake of 1934, while the second was about the man-made disaster that protested against the arrival of Prince Wales to Bombay during the non-cooperation Movement in 1921
 isi tarah teesraa or antim udhaaharan 1940 main sar androoj kii shradhanjali se judaa hua tha
 Apparently, in all these three incidents, Gandhi's language has changed according to the events
 gandhi bukamp kii ghatana main janmaal ko hue nuksaan ko badi samvednaa se varnit karte hai, to bombay kii ghatana main hindu-muslimon dwaara parsi or isaayiyon par kiye gaye hamalon kii bhartsana karte hai
 An example from Louis Fisher's book also established that Guha was very restrained as a speaker, not aggressive
 gandhi kii khaasiyat yah thi ki bolte samay vah bahut hi sahaj dhang se apni baat rakhte the
 On the basis of an example of Hind Swaraj, he told that Mahatma Gandhi's entire writing focuses on four main ideas - social change, economic progress, cultural unity and non-violence
 unhone gandhi dwaara sampadit indian opinian, yang india, harijan ke udaahranon dwaara bataaya ki inke zariye ham unke lekhan main aae vibhinn badlaavon ko bahut aasaani se lakshith kar sakate hai
 Historian Ramachandra Guha argued that the importance of Gandhi's prolific writing only increases when we see that this writing is not done in a fixed place, but he has made it possible in the midst of many journeys and many works in places
 Have done it
 unhone kaha ki ke

 In response to a question, he said that even as a lawyer, we may call Gandhi a failure, but his communication with the Indian public has been the transmission of new energy and the advocacy of public rights has been his main goal
