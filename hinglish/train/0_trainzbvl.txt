 -input bhashaa se Why cricket is so special between India and Pakistan was once again seen in the Great Cup of Asia Cup T20 when the rivalry between the two teams was at its peak
 yah match jisane bhi dekha wo apni saansen tham kar bas dekhtaa hi gaya
 When Team India was bowling, Pakistani wickets were falling fast and after dismissing Pakistan at 83, all the Indian fans started feeling that the match would be one-sided but the way Mohammad Aamir had already bowled four balls of the over
 But after walking Rohit and Rahane, in the next over, Raina also got caught in the way of the pavilion, then the match bowed to Pakistan
 lekin yah match aane vaale vakt main kohli-aamir yug ke aarambh ke taur par yaad kiya jayega
 Kohli played heavily on Aamir, which is a glimpse of writing a new round of india-pakistan cricket in the coming days
 pehle teen wicket gire to lagane laga ki agar ye 50overs kaa match hota to aamir akele hi puri team kaa safaya kar dete lekin jis tarah kohli ne unako manage kiya wo koi world class batsman hi kar saktaa tha
 Team India, who had lost three wickets for 8 runs in the first three overs, started seeing a huge score of 83 runs at one time but in such a situation, Virat Kohli, the vice-captain and not only the team but the best batsman of the whole world, took over the reins
 On the other hand, the former vice-captain of the team and the Yuvi who played the biggest role in getting India back to ODI World Cup stood
 in donon ne yahaan se wo pari kheli jisaki jitani bhi tarif kii jaae utani kam he
 Today's batting is enough to explain why Kohli is more powerful than the rest of the batsmen
 wo mohammad aamir ko bahut aasaani se manage kar rahe the
 They were just trying to stop Aamir
 unke dimag main match ke dauraan kya chal rahaa tha wo unhone match ke baad puraskaar die jane ke dauraan bataaya
 He congratulated the deadly Aamir on a difficult wicket during his match for his excellent bowling
 mushkil halaat kii samaj or us par shandaar gendbaaji kar rahe bowler ko sammaan dena, yahi to kisi cricketer ko bada banaata he
 That is, the reins of the team are going to such a skilled, capable, sensible and visionary mind that cannot stop him from raising the team's flag all over the world
 agar bharat pakistan ke bich aane vaale dinon mendwipaksheeya siries khelijati he to in donon ke bich hone vaala muqabla vakaar-jadeja, sachin-akram, kapil-miyandad, imran-gavaskar or venkatesh-sohail kii yaad jarur dilaaegaa
 It is important to mention here that before 2013, Virat Kohli's 53 in victory
 3 yogadan tha wo iske baad se badhkar 89
 4 percent
 australia ke daure se pehle tak kohli jahaan chauthe sabase adhik ran banane vaale tii20 ballebaaj the vahiin ab wo bade antar ke saath number ek par baithe hai
 The way they have adapted for this format, India's contention in the World T20 tournament looks even stronger
 aisi bowling dekhi nahindhoni ne jab toss jitkar pehle bowling karne kaa nirnay liya to unke dimag main kahin bhi aisa nahin hoga ki wo pakistan ko 100 se kam par roak lenge
 In the very first over, Nehra started the fall of the wicket by walking Mohammad Hafiz in the first over
 unki gendon par ran bananaa pakistan ke liye mushkil ho gaya tha
 While Nehra was in rhythm, Dhoni also threw three consecutive overs from him
 unki 18 gendon par do chauke samet kul 18 ran hi ban sake
 From the other end, Bumrah was supporting him well
 bumara kaa pehla over meden gaya
 In the next over, when he hit two fours, he took a wicket
 in donon ke chah overs tak pakistan ke teen wicket gir chuke the or scorcard par pakistan ke khate main keval 32 ran jude the
 After this Pandya and Yuvraj scattered the wickets like a card
 pandya ne aate hishoeb malikko chalata kiya or hawa main uchhalte hue apane donon pair kii edi ko takaraane ke khaas andaaj main uskaa jashn bhi manaaya
 Pakistan reached three more wickets to reach 32 to 42
 rahi sahi kasar jadeja ne puri kii
 Jadeja was throwing a straight ball
 round da wicket bowling karte hue wo pakistani cricketrs ke liye aaj teror ban gaye
 He told through his bowling and batting that you can make a significant contribution to the team not only by bat and ball but also fielding in the field
 maidan par chitah kii phurtiye fielding ke lihaaj se bahut hi shandaar pradarshan vaala match tha jisamen cricketrs apana sab kuch dene ko taiyaar the lekin is match kaa nirnay apane paksh main chaahate the or yahi unke pradarshan main bhi dikhaa
 Getting out on straight throws now seems less in international cricket but the way Kohli and Jadea both fielding in this T20 match, it is not to be appreciated
 jadeja na keval out field main balki apnigendbajike dauraan bhi behtareen fielding kaa najaara pesh kar rahe the
 At the time of Jonty Rhodes, it was often said that if you are not contributing with the bat, then you can save 25-30 runs with good fielding and in this match, a similar field of fielding was seen
 kitna mahatvapurn tha ye match donon tiimon ke liye iskaa isse hi pataa chalata he ki donon timen surakshit khelnaa chaahati thim or match ke dauraan ek bhi chakka nahin jadaa gaya
 This is only the fifth match when no six was hit in any international T20 match

 Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) President Sharad Pawar on Friday criticized BJP President Amit Shah and top BJP leaders including the Prime Minister for using his name repeatedly in the Assembly election campaign in Maharashtra and said he was involved in the economy and farmers
 Should speak on issues
 ensipi pramukh ne kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi, shah or mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ke abhiyaan kaa sabase bada mudda 'sharad pavaar' he
 In an election rally at Uruli near Kanchan here, Pawar once again mentioned "jail" without naming Shah, saying that those who should have been "in" are now running the administration of the country
 unhone kaha ki unhen isse koi shikaayat nahin he kyonki loktantr main har kisi ke paas uske adhikaar hote hai
 Pawar said the NCP welcomed the removal of Article 370 giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kendra se anuchhed 371 ko bhi khatm karne ke liye kaha, jo nagaland or meghalaya samet purvottar rajyon main jameen kharidne se roktaa he
 Taking a dig at Modi, Shah and Fadnavis, Pawar said, "wherever they go, only Sharad Pawar speaks about Sharad Pawar, Sharad Pawar

 How many cases are pending in the country's courts
 shaayad isaki sahi jaankaree kisi sarkaar yaa praadhikaaran ke paas nahin he
 In such a situation, many high courts or district courts made strange excuses in response to the RTI filed by India Today
 itnaa hi nahin, kisi ne daraaya to kisi ne dhamkaaya or kisi ne pehle paise maange to koi kanoonee aadchan kaa bahaanaa banaakar jaankaree dene se hi mukar gaya
 That is, the way RTI was understood and explained as it was
 haalanki, kuch adaalaton yaa unke afasaron ne sidhe-sidhe jaankaree di
 We had questions in the RTI application of Research Editor Ashok Kumar Upadhyay from India Today
 - desh bhar main kitni adaalatein hai?- rajyavar jajon ke kitne pad hai or kitne jaj hai?- kin kin adaalaton main kitne mukademe lambit hai or 2012 ke baad se inaki sankhya kitni he?- 2012 se ab tak adaalaton se kitne mukademe nipataae gaye?- in adaalaton main pichley 10 varshon se kitne mukademe lambit pade hai?pehla javabgujaratse aayaa, jisamen sawaalon ke jawaab dene ke bajaay hoicourt ke artiai vibhaag ne likhaa ki aapane 10 rupee jamaakar artiai arji lagaai he, jabaki hamaari fees 50 rupee he
 First deposit the money then the reply will be given
 yani chalis rupee or den tab jawaab len
 By the way, an answer to a question was made for 10 rupees
 iske baad dilli hoicourt se jawaab mila ki 19 sitambar 2018 tak dilli kii nichali adaalaton main kul 202 court hai
 But the number of judges, number of cases pending, how many were disposed of were answered in response to the question that its data is not available
 elahabaad hoicourt ke soochna vibhaag ne bhi jawaab dene ke bajaay kanoon padhaate hue taka sa jawaab diya
 In which, stating its fees and rules, it said that an application under RTI rule three will contain only one item
 niyam chaar ke tahat har arji ke saath nakad, pe-order yaa draft lagaana jaruri he
 It was also said that all these should be in the name of the Registrar General of the High Court or the District Judge of the district court concerned
 agar jawaab tender, nilaamee, kotesan, bijanas kantrect vagairah se sambandhit he jisamen discs, flopy, tepe yaa video casette ke rup main jawaab dena he to dhai sau rupee
 If you want answers on paper, you will get only 50 rupees
 pehle paise lao tab jawaab paao
 Only the central government answers for 10 rupees

 The Andhra Pradesh High Court said that the district judges have 234 posts in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, but 212 district judges are still working

 That is 16 is lacking
 vahiin junior civil jajon ke 533 pad tay hai, lekin kaam kar rahe hai sirf 474 yani 59 pad khaali hai
 In response to the remaining questions, he said that it is not possible for us to keep an account of every court
 maharashtra kii rajdhani mumbai kii adaalaton ne saaf kiya ki aapke jawaab chah pej main honge
 At the rate of five rupees per page, you deposit 30 rupees

 Jammu and Kashmir responded more aggressively
 unka kahana he ki sirf jammu-kashmir ke nivasee ko hi soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat jaankaree di ja sakati he
 You have asked for information from all over the country
 lihaaja ham aapke daayre main or aap hamaare artiai ke daayre main nahin aate
 So go, we cannot give you any information
 aap chahen to hamaare is aadesh ke khilaaf jammu-kashmir hoicourt main apil daakhil kar sakate hai, lekin hamaare jawaab ke 30 dinon ke bheetar
 We have no guarantee after 30 days
 rajasthan hoicourt ne jodhpur se jawaab bheja ki aapke puche gaye sawaalon ke jawaab nahin diye ja sakate
 The Calcutta High Court responded, but in response to questions related to the court and judges, said that they should check the website
 usamen sab likhaa he
 However, the data of pending and settled cases must be made available in the High Court and lower courts
 bheji gai jaankaree ke mutabik, kalakatta hoicourt main 2012 main teen lakh 62 hajaar 131 mukademe lambit the
 Of these, one lakh 97 thousand 757 cases were more than 10 years old
 2017 main ye aankada 2 lakh 22 hajaar 648 lambit kaa he
 Whereas, more than 10 years old cases are now just 38 thousand 678
 jila adaalaton main 2012 main 26 lakh 70 hajaar 568 lambit maamle the, jinamein se ek lakh 23 hajaar 983 maamle 10 saal se zyada puraane the
 In 2017, their number has reduced to 21 lakh 50 thousand 481 respectively
 jabaki, 10 saal se zyada puraane maamle bhi ek lakh 18 hajaar 938 hi rah gaye hai
 He also said that the cases settled in 2012 were one lakh four thousand 630
 vahiin, 2017 main 17 lakh do hajaar 203 ho gaye
 In the High Court also, 78 thousand 428 cases were dealt in 2012 and in 2017 their number was 62209
 purvottar ke rajyon main se bhi kuch ke jawaab aae
 The Information Department of the Manipur High Court also brushed off the reply by asking that it should directly ask the Union Law and Justice Ministry or the district courts
 meghalaya se bhi isi tarah kaa jawaab mila
 That is, RTI is the law overall, but everyone responds or hides according to their convenience and dilemma
 jawaab chupaane kii aad bhi artiai ke tahat milti he
 The life of Govind Swami is full of many controversies
 kuch log use budhu kehete hai, jabaki kuch log hatyara
 He brutally murdered five of his relatives while sleeping in 1984, but no one was a witness to the incident
 kuch log kehete hai ki swami ke maa-baap ko jameen vivaad main kaaphi pratadit kiya ja rahaa tha, isliye usne ye hatyaein kin, jabaki kuch log inhen sochi-samajhi hatyaein bataate hai
 One thing is certain in Swamy's case that he returned from it five times in a long wait of his death sentence of 22 years and three times his mercy petition was rejected
 lekin tamilnadu ke garib parivaar se taalluk rakhane vaala swami raashtrapati pratibha patil ke kshamaadaan ke visheshadhikaar kaa phayda uthaane vaala pehla vyakti bana
 Following a government order issued on December 31, 2009, 45-year-old Govind is now living a new life in Coimbatore jail
 bharat ke itihaas main ab tak kisi bhi raashtrapati ne maut kii sajaa paae logon ko kshamaa dene ke liye itani baar apane adhikaar kaa istemaal nahin kiya he jitna ki maujuuda raashtrapati patil ne
 He has saved a record 30 people from capital punishment in the last 28 months, which is more than 90 per cent of the death penalty pardons awarded in India so far
 inamen se 22 kshamaa hasil karne vaale to aise the jo ek saath kai logon kii barbar hatya or bacchon ke saath vibhats aparaadh se jude the
 Many of these were crooks who defied the law
 yahaan tak ki kai ke aparaadhon kii krurta ko dekhakar adaalat bhi hatprabh rah gai thi
 Did such people deserve mercy? See the case of Sushil Murmu
 nau saal kaa chirku besara 11 disambar, 1996 ko jharkhand ke hazaribagh se gaayab ho gaya
 His father was looking for Chirku everywhere
 udhar, murmu is bachche ko bahala-phuslaa kar apane ghar le gaya or uskaa sir katkar kaali maa ke saamne 'bali' chadha diya
 He then hid the body in a sack, loaded it on his bicycle and threw it into a lake
 murmu kaa yah pehla aparaadh nahin tha
 Investigation revealed that he had already 'sacrificed' his brother
 2004 main use milane vaali maut kii sajaa ko barkaraar rakhte hue supreme court ne ise 'maanavtaa ke khilaaf aparaadh' bataaya tha
 But the President granted pardon to Murmu on 9 February 2012
 supreme court ke paas ise sweekaar karne ke alaava koi vikalp nahin tha
 As the eminent American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes puts it, in a modern democracy, the right to sentence to death rests with the judiciary and the right to give life to the executive
 bharat ke purv mukhya nyaayadhish je
 s
 verma kaa kahana he, ''nyaaypalika kaa kaam yah dekhnaa he ki koi vyakti doshi he yaa nahin or yaheen par uskaa kaam khatm ho jaataa he
 The amnesty is a completely executive process, the President has to decide
 nyaaypalika ko is prakriya se baahar rahanaa chahie
 In June 2010, when pardon was given to Dharmendra Singh and Narendra Yadav of Uttar Pradesh, there was a sharp reaction in the country
 1994 main unhone paanch logon ke ek puure parivaar ko khatm kar diya tha jisamen 15 saal kii ek ladki bhi thi
 Narendra had attempted to rape the girl a few days before the incident, but failing this, he conspired with Dharmendra to teach a lesson to the whole family - three people were strangled to death and 10 years old They burnt a child alive in the fire
 samvidhan kaa anuchhed 72 kisi sajaa, yahaan tak ki maut kii sajaa ke maamle main bhi kshamaadaan, use lambit karne, raahat dene yaa use badalane kaa purna or nirankush adhikaar raashtrapati ko detaa he
 Jurist Rajiv Dhawan says, "but he has to act on the advice of the Union Council of Ministers
" '' raashtrapati ko kisi maamle ke gun-dosha kii bhi jaanch kerani hoti he jaisaa ki 1999 main kehar singh maamle main kiya gaya tha
 Well the fact is that in 2005 former President A
 pi
 J
 abdul kalam ne sabase pehle swami kii dayaa yachika par sakaaratmak rup se vichaar shuru kiya tha, jab unhen yah pataa chalaa ki usne jo hatyaein kii hai, ''uskaa koi bhi gavaah'' nahin he
 It is surprising on what basis Shobhit Chamar was granted amnesty in 2011
 bihar ke bhabhua jile ke tirozepur durgavati gaanv ke nivasee is bhoomihin mochi ne savarna jati ke ek jameendaar parivaar ke chah logon kii hatya kar di thi, jisamen 10 or aath saal ke do bachche bhi the, sirf is shaq kii vajah se ki uske bhai kii hatya main is parivaar kaa haath he
 The Supreme Court remarked in 1998, "he has demonstrated the most inhuman conduct by celebrating his victory after committing this crime
" ''2012 main kshamaadaan ke lagbhag har maamle bacchon ke khilaaf puri tarah se barbarta kii kahani kehete hai
 On February 20, 1996, Molai Ram was working as a janitor at the jailor's residence at the Central Jail in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh
 ek or vyakti santosh yadav ko garden kii rakhwali kaa kaam saunpa gaya tha
 Yadav was facing sentence in a rape case
 jailer kii ek naaballig beti gaayab ho gai or uskaa shav agle din paas kii ek pashushaala main bane septic tanks main paaya gaya
 The girl was raped and murdered by Molai and Santosh
 supreme court ke purv nyaayadhish markandeya katju kaa kahana he, ''sajaa dene kaa darshan chaar siddhanton par nirbhar karata he
 This can be preventive and can be done by creating fear
 yah dandatmak ho saktaa he jiske liye kisi vyakti par jurmaana lagaaya jaataa he
 "it can also be defensive so that a crime can be prevented or it can be corrective that strengthens human character
" kshamaadaan ke peeche antim siddhant kaam karata he
 Therefore, Kalam wrote in Swamy's case in 2005 that "law is also a medium for reform
" ''haalanki, 25 july, 2007 ko apane chune jane ke baad kareeb do saal tak raashtrapati patil ne puraani parampara ke mutabik dayaa yachikaaon kii filon par dhul jamaa hone di
 Minister of State for Home M
 ramchandran ne may main rajyasabha main bataaya ki jab raashtrapati ne govind swami kaa maamla haath main liya tha to unke paas dayaa ke 34 maamle lambit the jise unhone teji se nibataya he or ab sirf aise 19 maamle bache hai
 There are other inconsistencies in the case: Gurmeet Singh, now awaiting death after killing 13 people in 1986, was not included in the mercy list even after 25 years in jail and two mercy petitions
 aakhir kyon 1993 main dilli main bam hamalaa karne vaale devender paal singh bhullar kii 2003 kii dayaa yachika ko list main khiskaa kar rajeev gandhi ke hatyaron kii saal 2000 kii yachika se upar jagah di gai?in sab se supreme court bhi chintit he or usne kshamaadaan ke sabhi record maange hai
 Uday U, a special prosecutor and expert in law matters appointed by the Supreme Court in the 2G case
 lalit kehete hai, ''raashtrapati ko mila kshamaadaan kaa adhikaar is dharna par aadhaarit he ki yah janhit main istemaal kiya jayega
 But if it is found that the pardon has been used in the wrong form or illegally , then the judiciary has the right to review it

 With this, it became clear that BJP is not in favor of any direct fight between Kiran Bedi and Arvind Kejriwal
 pichley 24 ghante main dilli vidhansabha se sambandhit 10 badi gatividhiyon par daalate hai ek nazar
 
 
 1
 bijepi kii siem pad kii ummidavaar ghoshit hone ke baad kiran bedi ko aam aadmi party ke sanyojak or siem pad ke ummidavaar arvind kejariwal ne ek twit ke zarie badhai dete hue khuli bahes kii chunauti di he jiske jawaab main kiran bedi ne kaha he ki ve sadan main arvind kejariwal ke saath bahes karengi

 arvind kejariwal main ek anya twit main kiran bedi se ye bhi kaha ki, ''main aapako twitor par follow karata tha par aapane mujhe block kar diya he, pleez mujhe anblock kar mere saath saarvajanik bahes karen
 However, Ajay Maken has said to accept the challenge of the debate
 3
 Aam Aadmi Party member Kumar Vishwas has also targeted Kiran Bedi, re-tweeting an old tweet by Kiran Bedi and asked that you like watching the debate between Obama and Romney but don't get involved in the debate itself, Then you say- i dare
 
 ? 4
 isse pehle somvaar der raat bijepi sansadeey board ne purv ipies adhikari kiran bedi ko 7 farvari ko hone ja rahe dilli vidhansabha chunaav ke liye party kaa siem pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya
 The decision was taken by the party president Amit Shah in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the parliamentary board meeting
 5
 Referring to Kiran Bedi's name, party president Amit Shah said that Kiran Bedi will command the assembly election campaign in Delhi and herself will contest from Krishnanagar seat
 bijepi adhyaksh ne kiran bedi ko party kii taraf se mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaae jane ko lekar kisi tarah ke matbhed se bhi inkaar kiya

 The party has given tickets to 28 sitting mlas and left 2 seats for the Akali Dal

 You are considering bjp's decision to contest Bedi from Krishnanagar as a bad decision
 kehane ko to raashtrapati chunaav ko lekar bijepi or vipaksh ke bich baatcheet kaa silsilaa shuru ho chukaa he taaki kisi naam par aam sahmati banaai ja sake

 BJP ke raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar kii ghoshnaa abhi nahin hui he lekin isse pehle hi vipakshi kheme main daraaren dikhne lagi hai
 Some parties of the opposition have made up their mind that no matter what the name is, they do not have to support the NDA candidate and field the candidate of the opposition
 vahiin kuch partiyaan aisi hai jo BJP ke ummidavaar ke prati naram rukh dikhaane kaa ishaara abhi se kar rahi hai
 Sitaram Yechury and Venkaiah Naidu are scheduled to meet on Friday, but Yechury made it clear on Thursday before the meeting that consensus is difficult to reach and elections will be held
 yechuri ne kaha ki sarkaar aam sahmati banane ke naam par sirf der kar rahi he taaki vipakshi partiyon ko is mudde par aapas main vichaar karne kaa mauka na mili
 He said that if the government were really in favor of consensus, the name would have been disclosed so that the opposition parties could discuss it
 yechuri ne saaf kaha ki sarkaar ek taraf aam sahmati banane kii baat kar rahi he lekin duusari taraf yah bhi kah rahi he ki janadesh kaa sammaan hona chahie
 Sitaram Yechury says that only 31 per cent of the people had voted for BJP in the Lok Sabha elections and the remaining votes were received by opposition parties
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki janadesh vipakshi partiyon ke saath he
 If Sitaram Yechury gives the same logic to BJP leaders also, what can be the outcome of the meeting can be easily guessed
 sutron ke mutabik left partiyaan gopal krishna gandhi kovipaksh kaa ummidavaarbananaa chaahati hai
 Sharad Yadav, who attended the opposition meeting on behalf of JDU, also considers himself in the presidential election race
 vipakshi partiyon main is baat ko lekar bhi matbhed he ki aam aadmi party ko vipakshi kheme main shaamil kiya jaae yaa nahin
 The left parties are in favor of keeping the Aam Aadmi Party together, but the Congress and some other parties want to keep the Aam Aadmi Party away in this matter
 left partiyaan hi nahin lalu yadav kaa rashtriya janata dal bhi kisi bhi haalat main bijepi keummidavaar kaa samarthanakarne ke paksh main nahin he
 Lalu Yadav feels that standing with the BJP will not be good according to his vote bank
 isiilie buudhvaar ko hui vipakshi dalon kii baithak main lalu yadav ne jor dekar kaha ki raashtrapati chunaav ke liye vichaardhaara se samjhauta nahin kiya ja saktaa
 At the same time, parties like NCP are indicating that if the BJP candidate is worthy of mind, then she can leave the opposition camp and come with the government in this matter
 ensipi netaa tarik anwar kaa kahana he ki sirf naam ke liye chunaav karaane kaa koi matlab nahin he
 Especially when we know that the NDA has the winning numbers
 vartmaan raashtrapati pranav mukherjee kaa kaarykaal 24 july ko khatm ho rahaa he or 21 july tak nae raashtrapati shapath le lenge
 Voting for the presidential election is scheduled on July 17 and the counting of votes will take place in Delhi on July 20

 Is there any problem with the trolls of Modi supporters? i do not understand where this group of people who describe themselves as Modi devotees and those who have come on the abyss have been mentioned? These people are neither from RSS nor BJP

 In Noida, UP, the body of a missing innocent was stirred
 maasoom kaa shav ghar ke paas sthit naale main mila
 The deceased child was missing since 27 August
 police maamla darj kar jaanch main juty he
 The incident is from Haraula village located in Sector-5, Noida
 8 saal ke mritak maasoom kaa naam karn tha
 According to family members, on August 27, Karna went missing from outside the house
 parijanon ne karn ko dhundne kii kaaphi koshish kii lekin uskaa kuch pataa nahin chal sakaa
 After being exhausted, the family informed the police about the innocent call
 jiske baad ek baar phir noida police kaa laaparvaah cheharaa saamne aayaa
 Instead of filing a complaint, the police advised the family to search Karna and return them
 somvaar ko karn kii laash ghar ke paas hi bah rahe naale main milane se uske parivaar main koharaam much gaya
 Karna's body was locked in a sack and thrown into the drain
 chaar bahanon kaa eklauta bhai karn ab is duniya main nahin tha
 Family members believe they have no enmity with anyone
 aise main sawaal khadaa hota he ki aakhir kis vajah se karn ko agava kar berahami se uskihatyakar di gai
 At the same time, the family accused the police that if the police had taken the matter seriously in time, Karna would have been alive today
 philhal police maasoom kii maut ke baad karrwai kii baat kah rahi he
 On June 11, when the sun was setting in amid the humid summer, the BJP was approaching the formula of celebrating its ancestral LK Advani, who had reached the slopes of politics
 adwani ke ghar par hi thik 6 bajkar 7 minute par bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh ne ek likhit bayaan padhaa, 'aaj dopaher aresas ke sarasanghachaalak shri mohan bhagwat ne shri adwani ke saath charchaa kii or bijepi ke sansadeey board ke nirnay ko maanate hue rashtrahit main party kaa maargdarshan karte rahane kaa aagrah kiya
 Mr
 Advani has decided to follow Mr
 Bhagwat's advice
 ' yah mahaj bhuuchaal thaamne kii bhagwat booti bhar nahin thi, balki parade ke peeche se salaah dene vaale sangh ne ab kaise party main faisla karwaane se lekar uske amal tak kii kaman sambhaal lee he, uskaa khullamakhulla ikraarnama tha
 This is the first time in the history of the Sangh Parivar when its interference in the BJP was engraved on paper
 ab yah ek dastavej hi nahin, balki bijepi ke har ahm faisle main bhagwat, adwani or party ke bich kii ahm kadi ban gaye hai
 On the other hand, Suresh Soni, the co-sarkaryavah of the union that has become the center of this earthquake, has come to the dock
 unki dakhlandaji se aahat bijepi ke ek varisht netaa ne bhagwat ko phone kar yahaan tak kah diya, ''agar isi tarah se faisle honge to aap shaayad sangh ke antim sar sanghachaalak kehlaayenge
 'the power imposed by the Chasakakya, is the nationalist and cultural organization's boisterous union really away from politics or is it being completely politicized now? Unionization of BJP is a harsh truth, though neither the Sangh nor the BJP accepted it
 lekin jis tarah goa main soni ne bijepi ke andruni maamalon main bad-chadhakar hissaa liya or adwani jaise varishthatam netaa ko nazarandaaj karne kii koshish kii, usase sangh kii saakh par batta laga he
 Forced BJP now has to directly take over Bhagwat
 sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he ki july ke aakhir main amravati main hone vaali sangh ke maardarshak mandal kii baithak main soni se bijepi kaa kaamkaaj chhinakar use duusare sah sarkarywah gopal krishna yaa dattatreya hosbale ko de diya jaae
 Bhagwat has a theory about BJP - the party's image is associated with the reform of the party
 isliye sangh ne peedigat badlaav ke tahat bijepi kii surgery kaa bidaa uthaaya
 In front of Nitin Gadkari for the post of president, Gadkari, who became Bhagwat's choice, fell victim to the bjp's tussle despite the Sangh's green signal for a second term
 is prakaran ne adwani or bhagwat ke bich samvadaheenata kii sthiti paidaa kar di thi, lekin adwani ke istipha prakaran ne donon ke bich samvaad kaayam kar diya he
 It is for the first time that the advisory union has also played a direct role in persuading the decision of the BJP Parliamentary Board
 haalanki sangh pehle bhi paroksh rup se raajnneeti main dakhal detaa rahaa he, lekin atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv main endie kii sarkaar banane ke baad sambandh khulkar saamne aane lage
 The former Sarsanghchalak of the Sangh, Rajju Bhaiya, did not have a power race, so the situation of discord in the family did not come out
 tab vaajapeyi kii chhavi or kad kii vajah se bhi sangh mukhar nahin ho paata tha
 But K
 on March 10, 2000, considered a hardliner
 es
 After Sudarshan became Sarsanghchalak, direct interference in BJP started
 tahalaka prakaran par unhone sidhe vaajapeyi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 On 18 March 2001, he said, "there are some incompetent people sitting in the Prime Minister's Office
" sakasham log hote to yah sankat nahin hota
 "while the BJP-RSS did not have a rage during the NDA rule, the knot was definitely formed
" jiskaa visphot sudarshan ne 9 april, 2005 ko ek intervyuu main vaajapeyi-adwani ko ritair hone kii salaah dekar kiya
 When the Jinnah was declared secular, the Sangh opened a front against Advani
 usne adwani ko 16-18 sitambar, 2005 ko hui chennai kaaryakarini kii baithak main yah elaan karne ko majaboor kar diya ki ve disambar main adhyaksh pad chhod denge
 At that time, Advani also accused the Sangh of interfering in the daily work of the party
 par usee sangh ne 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main adwani ko piem ummidavaar banaaya
 Sarkaryavah Joshi of the Sangh had admitted in an interview with India Today, "if one occasion (jinnah episode) is left out, i don't think the Sangh is interfering in the daily work of the BJP
" 'lekin yah bhi tathy he ki agar sangh bijepi par niyantran karnaa chahta he to bijepi bhi vaicharik-nitigat maamalon se lekar har masale par sangh kii ore hi takataki lagaae rahati he
 The reason for this is the huge cadre of the Sangh and through this power, it has complete control over the BJP
 sangh kaa ek numaayinda bijepi main hameshaa rahata he
 The organization minister of the party is entirely the pracharak of the Sangh, who is appointed by the Sangh itself
 philhal bijepi main kendriya str par ek sanghathan mantri or do sah sanghathan mantri sangh kii ore se hai, yahi sthiti rajyon main bhi hoti he
 Now, Mellie Chadariya Sangh has always made politics a tool for realizing its thinking
 aazaadee ke baad jansangh main pan
 Sent volunteers like Deendayal Upadhyay, the Sangh made it its mask since the bjp's inception in 1980
 lekin endie kii sarkaar banane ke baad se sangh ke prachaarkon kaa rujhaan bhi raajnneeti kii ore badha
 The pracharaks in the Sangh are now getting reduced and the full-time workers now want to come only for certain deadlines
 pehle to prachaarak vyavastha main shaamil hone ke liye log naukari chhodkar aate the
 Sarkaryavah Bhaiyyaji Joshi himself is an example of this
 sangh kii maujuuda peedi main aise logon kii kami nahin he
 Prior to Advani, Uma Bharti has also written a letter complaining about Soni
 haal hi main madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne soni kii ichha ke baavjood prabhaat jha ko dobaaraa pradesh adhyaksh nahin banane diya to soni ne bhi shivaraj ko sansadeey board main nahin aane diya
 An announcement by Bhagwat himself not to allow the leaders of D-4 (sushma, Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu, Anant Kumar) to become president, comparing the BJP to the ashes and the need for chemotherapy, the RSS directly interfered in the BJP
 sangh pehle bijepi main do-teen ummidavaaron kii sifarish karata tha, lekin adta nahin tha
 Now, in every seat of the state election committee or at the center, the union nominees (organization general ministers) have started using the veto
 1998 main vajayapi ne jaswant singh ko mantri banane ke liye raashtrapati bhawan list bhej di, lekin shapath se pehle sangh ke dabaav main naam katwaya gaya
 People in the Sangh are now joining more due to less, personal selfishness with respect, loyalty, devotion
 ab bijepi ke netaaon ko lagane laga he ki agar ve sangh ke kisi netaa kaa varadahast hasil kar pradesh adhyaksh, saansad yaa vidhayak ban sakate hai, to ve jila-mandal main apana samay kyon ganvaaen
 The duality of change and the kamabhagavata in the branch have always said that they are ready to change everything except 'india is a Hindu nation'
 lekin aadhuniktaa ke saath sangh kaa antarvirodh badlaav kii raah main roda he
 "when Hedgewar made a khaki knicker as a uniform, it was the modern dress that only the British wore," says a senior Sangh leader
 sangh kaa bada tabaka aadhunik daur main isamen badlaav chahta he lekin puraane log ise pratik maanakar baithe hai
 "but the propaganda head of the Sangh, Manmohan Vaidya, argues," The Sangh always changes, we leave the old things and move forward
 abhi ganavesh main badlaav par bhale sahmati nahin he, lekin shakha main aane ke liye ganavesh kii koi pabandi nahin he
 'it is also a sad truth that the Sangh branches are continuously declining
 khud sarkarywah bhaiyyaji joshi kaboolte hai, ''aaj paristhitiyaan alag hai
 There has been a change in lifestyle and education system, which has resulted in the whole social life and some of the Sangh branch
 ” ek anumaan ke mutabik, desh bhar main sangh kii 30,000 niyamit shakhaaen chal rahi hai
 When this correspondent visited some branches of East Delhi and took stock, at least four or ten volunteers appeared there
 sangh ke ek netaa kaa kahana he, ''jab main bal swayamsevak ke rup main shakha main jaataa tha, to mitti kaa kashmir banaakar suraksha kaa khel khelte the
 He suffered a shoulder injury in the same game, which has been a pain till date, but the enthusiasm has not diminished
 ” ve maanate hai ki aaj shakha main aane vaale swayamsevakon main waisi vaicharik patibaddhta nahin he
 Having been a long-time pracharak in the Sangh and now a senior leader who is holding important responsibility in the BJP, some share their pain in this manner, "the Sangh has been declining since Deoras

 Recently Deepika Padukone was mistakenly called Priyanka in place of Deepika by foreign media
 uske baad vah video bharat main kaaphi viral hua
 Expressing anger over this, Deepika has said that this comment is derogatory
 deepika ne ek event ke dauraan kaha, yah sirf mere liye kahi gai baat nahin thi
 This can happen to any of us and this issue is not just an issue of ignorance, but also racism

 Ekadashi of Ashadha Krishna Paksha is called Yogini Ekadashi
 is ekadshi kaa paap ke praayshchit ke liye vishesh mahatv bataaya gaya he
 On this day, one gets freedom from sins by meditating on Bhajan and Kirtan of Shri Hari
 kaha jaataa he ki agar is din upwas rakhkar bhagwaan vishnu kaa dhyaan kiya jaae to manushya ko uske har paap se mukti mil jaati he
 This time Yogini Ekadashi is on 29th June
 yogini ekadshi ke upwas kii vidhi-- praatavkaal snaan karke surya devtaa ko jal arpit karen 
 After this, worship Lord Vishnu by wearing yellow clothes
 - unhen pile phool,panchamrita or tulsi dal arpit karen 
 After this, chant the mantras of Shri Hari and Mother Lakshmi
 - kisi nirdhan vyakti ko jal kaa, ann-vastra kaa yaa juute chaate kaa daan karen 
 Keep fast only after consuming water and fruits
 achche swasthya or maansik samasyaon se mukti ke liye kya karen-- ekadshi kaa upwas rakhen
 Take only aquatic foods throughout the day and night
 - jitna sambhav ho shiv ji kii upasna karen
 - Speak at least and do not get angry
 paap ke praayshchit ke liye kya karen-- ekadshi kaa upwas rakhen
 - Worship Shri Hari in the morning and evening
 - gajendra moksh kaa paath karnaa sarvottam hoga
 Apart from this, reciting the eleventh chapter of the Bhagavad Gita also provides benefits
 - is din pipal kaa paudha lagaaein or nirdhanon ko ann, vastra yaa dhan kaa daan karen
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) announced the names of 185 candidates from 20 states and three union territories for the Lok Sabha elections on the evening of Holi
 inamen pradhanmantri modi varanasi se, party adhyaksh amit shah gandhinagar se, grahamantri rajnath singh lakhanu se, nitin gadakari nagpur se chunaav ladenge
 Giving tickets, the party has again relied on 99 percent of Union ministers
 bijepi ne pratyaashiyon kii teesri list jari kar di he
 Today the fourth list is also expected
 sutron ke mutabik bijepi ne faisla liya he ki 75 se zyada umr ke netaaon ko chunaav nahin ladvaya jayega
 Therefore, before the announcement, the party's general secretary Ramlal met LK Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi, Kalraj Mishra and announced the party's decision
 bisi khanduri or shanta ko phone par party ke faisle se avgat kara diya gaya
 Therefore, BJP President Amit Shah was replaced by Gandhinagar as the candidate in place of LK Advani and Kalraj Mishra himself announced that he would not contest the Lok Sabha elections
 unhen party ne haryana main chunaav prabharee kii jo zimmedaari di he, usase vah santusht hai
 In Uttar Pradesh, BJP announced the names of 29 candidates, including Prime Minister Modi, in which the mps from Shahjahanpur and 6 mps including Minister of State for Agriculture were nominated in the Modi government
 sanbhal se satyapal saini, agra se saansad purv kendriya mantri or anusuchit ayog ke adhyaksh ramshankar katheria, fatehpur sikri se babulal choudhary, hardoi se anshul verma, mishrikh se anjubala kaa tikat kaata gaya he
 According to party sources, the status of the survey was not worth winning, along with the feedback from all these namo apps and activists
 isliye inaki jagah par nae chehron ko jagah di gai he
 The most shocking name came out of Sangamitra Maurya from Badaun, who is the daughter of Swami Prasad Maurya, a minister in the Yogi government
 swami prasad maury 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle bispi chhodkar bijepi main shaamil hue the
 Who will get the ticket from the mother and son? However, the name of Union Minister Maneka Gandhi has not been announced from where she will contest
 sutron kaa kahana he ki menka gandhi ne party netritv ko kaha tha vah is baar pilibhit kii jagah haryana kii karnal seat se chunaav ladanaa chaahati hai
 While his son Varun Gandhi should be given ticket from Pilibhit
 varun gandhi abhi sultanpur se saansad hai
 But sources say that BJP will give ticket to former MP Arvind Sharma who joined BJP in Haryana only last week
 isliye menka gandhi ko kah diya gaya ki karnal main no entry
 In such a situation, now Maneka Gandhi wants him to be given ticket from Sultanpur and Varun Gandhi from Pilibhit
 varun gandhi 2009 main pilibhit se loksabhaa chunaav jeet chuke hai
 The party leadership wants only one of Maneka Gandhi and Varun Gandhi to be given a ticket
 ab dekhnaa ye he ki party maa-bete par kya faisla leti he
 In Rajasthan, BJP has announced 16 out of 25 candidates
 jhunjhanu se santosh ahlavat kaa tikat isliye kaata gaya kyonki purv mukhyamantri vashundhara raaje se unki patari nahin baithti thi or sabakaa namo ap or kaaryakartaaon kaa feedback ke saath-saath party survey main sthiti jeetne laayak nahin thi
 In 2014, BJP won 25 out of 25 Lok Sabha seats in the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin alvar se saansad mahant chand nath or ajmer se saansad sawar laal jat kii mrityu ke baad upachunaav main bijepi ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Dausa MP Harishchand Meena joined the Congress in the assembly elections
 sutron kaa kahana he ki vasundhara raaje ne party netritv se chunaav naa ladane kii ichha jataai thi
 Therefore, the party has given his son Dushyant Singh a ticket from Jhalawar for the fourth time
 karnataka kii tasvirkarnataka main bijepi 28 siton main se 21 siton par ummidavaaron ke naam ghoshit kar chuki he
 The party has given tickets to all its sitting mps
 shivamoga se bies yediurppa ke bete raghavendra ko, hasan seat se congress chhodkar dobaaraa bijepi main shaamil hue purv mantri e manju ko, congress chhodkar bijepi main shaamil hone vaale vidhayak dow umesh jadhav ko gulberga se mallikarjun khadge ke khilaaf tikat diya
 Apart from this, the party has given another chance to Union Minister Sadanand Gowda, Anant Hegde
 abhi tak bengalooru dakshin seat se ummidavaar ke naam kii ghoshnaa nahin hui he
 If sources are to be believed, the party had recommended the appointment of Anant Kumar's wife Tejaswini Anant Kumar as a candidate, but the name of Anant Kumar's wife Tejaswini could not be announced after opposition from co-organization minister BL Santosh
 bijepi ne jis tarah se apni pehali list main ummidavaaron ke naamon kii ghoshnaa kii he, use dekhakar lagata he ki party ne jodtod karke jatigat aadhaar par jo sameekaran taiyaar hua he wo party kii ranneeti ke hisaab se sahi he
 But this time it is not the 2014 elections but 2019, where the opposition has united in many states, not wanting it

 10 karod missd kol yun hi nahin aate rajnath ji
 You were also given a chance
 aapane kya kiya? bas bijepi ko centre main satta tak pahunchaa diya
 Admittedly, BJP got so many seats for the first time, but the road to power goes through UP
 rajnath ji aap to upi ke hi rahanevaale hai or gujarat se aakar amit babu ne utani siten dilava deen
 She left a little bit because it was a family affair, otherwise 'AAP' would never have happened in Delhi
 ab aap hi bataaie
 What does 17 crore votes mean as against 10 crore missed calls
 aapane to suna hi hoga - 'hajaaron saal nargis apni benuri pe roti he badi mushkil se hota he chaman main didavar paidaa'
 Amit Babu is just like that
 pichley janm main dinadayal upaadhyaay se unka jarur koi na koi rishta rahaa hoga
 If you are not sure, then face them in the truth - all the things of the past life will be known
 shukr manaaie modi ji ko kahin janaa tha
 Therefore, only Amit and Gandhi could take the name of Lohia than Amit Babu
 haa, dinadayal ji kaa nahin bhuule
 If a little more time was there, Amit Babu would have left behind Marx, Lenin and Che Gavara in terms of miracles
 har netaa apane daur ke hisaab se chalata he
 Gandhi and JP used to tell people to go to jail - and people would run to them
 ab kiski aukaat he jo aisa kar paae
 It is not a matter of long time
 ramlila andolan ke vakt anna kii bhi jabaan thodi fisali thi - or aas-paas jo bhi maujuud the unki aukaat chehre bataa rahe the
 After that, Anna also never took the name of filling the jail
 vakt ke saath chalanaa bahut jaruri hota he
 Expect the same from the public so that the work gets done easily
 jab log missd kol kii bhashaa samajhate hai to usee main rasta nikaaliye
 a missed call in the morning means something else, something else in the evening
 har baat ke liye missd kol he
 Each missed call means different
 bas missd kol kaa intjaam karnaa bhar he
 The result is in front of you
 vaise is missd kol kii hakeekat koi dilli ke us skool ke teaching staff se puche, jisaki selary roak di gai thi
 The crime was just that they had failed to get their students' parents to be members of the BJP
 bijepi ke sadsyta abhiyaan par sabase dilachasp to ek akhbaar kii wo report rahi jisamen patrkaar ne puri aapbeetee sunai
 Due to professionalism, when he returned the call on a missed call on his mobile, a welcome message came from the BJP - and in the reply of the message he sent that he was not interested in such a membership, he got a reply - your in BJP Welcome, now you just mail the voter ID
 ye to unheen international kol kii tarah he jin par kol back na karne ke liye mobile companiyaan vaise hi chetavanee detii hai jaise bank kisi se apane ditels na share karne kii salaah dete rahete hai
 If someone calls from their prepaid mobile on that missed call, then the balance is cleared immediately
 matlab ye ki aapane kisi missd kol par kol back kar diya to gaye kaam se
 Now go to the court and claim that you are not a member of the BJP
 baaki koi jo bhi kahe - duniya main jab bhi missd kol kii baat hogi - sabase badi party kaa naam bijepi hi hoga
 Indeed
 jab aap nasibavaale ke saath rahenge to 'kirapa' to barasegi hi
 Modi ji has imposed it
 faisla pehle hi suna diya gaya phir to kaaryakarini main ab na bahes kii gunjaaish bachi he na sunwaayee kii
 In the true sense, the 'missed call' that the BJP has succeeded with Amit Babu's value, price, punishment and distinction is neither 'ghosts nor future'

 Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal, who has been embroiled in defamation cases, has resorted to apology diplomacy
 kejariwal ne punjab ke purv mantri bikram majithia se likhit maafee maangi he
 Kejriwal said in his apology that the allegations were baseless, but i am sorry but on this apology he was surrounded in his own house
 punjab vidhansabha jeetne ke liye dilli mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal punjab ke tatkaaleen mantri bikram singh majithia ko pani pi-pikar kar kosa tha
 Charges were raised in every rally, every stage
 chandigarh main gheraa, janldhar main gheraa, amritsar main gheraa, majeetha main bhi gheraa
 Even in Punjab, there was a hue and cry for the common man to be put in jail
 lekin saal bhar baad hi kejariwal palati maar gaye the, court main manahani kaa cese is kadar baari padaa ki maafee maangane kii naubat aa gai
 This is the first time that a Chief Minister has given a written apology
 punjab ke purv mantri bikram singh majithiyagruuvaar ko haath main kejariwal kii chitthee laharaate hue press conference main aae
 And announced that Kejriwal, who made those serious allegations, has apologized
 akali netaa ne kejariwal or aap netaaon ke aaropon par manahani kaa cese kiya tha
 Along with Kejriwal, Sanjay Singh and Ashish Khaitan were also dragged into the court
 lekin kejariwal kii maafeename par unhone bada dil dikhaaya 
 
 
 And forgive all in one stroke
 majithia akali sarkaar main naa sirf powerful mantri the
 He was also related to the Badal family, being deputy CM
 sukhbir singh kii patni harsimrat cor unki bahan hai yahi vajah he ki kejariwal ne punjab chunaav main majithia par nishaanaa saadhaa
 But in this episode, he crossed the threshold so much that the matter reached the court and he had to bow down and apologize
 majithia ne to ek jatke main dilli ke mukhyamantri ko maaf kar diya lekin aarope lagaakar kar maafee maangane kaa andaaj unke apane hi logon ko raas nahin aa rahaa he
 Kumar Vishwas, who was already angry, got angry, and the Punjab mlas called the public an insult
 ab shuukravaar ko bhagwant maan ne punjab party adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya or sanjay singh bhi kejariwal ke khilaaf khadey hue
 The Punjab unit of the Aam Aadmi Party is also unable to digest the letter of apology written to Majithia
 punjab vidhansabha main aam aadmi party ke netaa sukhpal singh khera ne kaha ki maafee se pehle kejariwal ne koi charchaa nahin kii
 He tweeted that this would send a wrong message to the public
 dilli ke mukhyamantri kejariwal ne ye aarope kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali ke khilaaf bhi lagaaya tha or is aarope ko lekar bhi wo court kaa chakkar kaat rahe hai
 Jaitley has filed a defamation suit against Kejriwal and AAP leaders - Kumar Vishwas, Ashutosh, Sanjay Singh, Raghav Chadha and Deepak Vajpayee seeking compensation of Rs 10 crore
 maamla 2015 se hi chal rahaa hai ab kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki kejariwal jetali se bhi chitthee likhakar maafee maang sakate hai
 After Kejriwal's apology to Majithia, this speculation got further air from the statement of the AAP spokesperson
 kejariwal ab sarkaar main hai, party ke sabase bade chehre hai
 And now the election season is about to come, a year later there is also a Lok Sabha election in 2019
 aise main naa to party or naa hi kejariwal chaahate hai ki court cese main yun hi fanse rahe, court kaa chakkar lagaate rahe
 In such a situation, there is no better mantra than forgiveness, they will bow down and avoid the case
 or logon ko sandesh bhi de denge ki wo ab adiyal nahin rahe, unhen sach ke aage jhukna bhi aata he or isse unhen parhez nahin he

 As of now it has not been revealed what kinds of things have been recovered from the arrested detective
 gauratlab he ki pakistan ke liye jasusi karne ke aarope main maadhuri gupta pehle hi nyaayik hiraasat main bheji ja chuki hai
 Considering the seriousness of the matter, the administration is stepping up
 rajyasabha main aaj jiesti bill ko pesh kiya jayega
 a tax rule will come into force in the country as soon as the GST bill is passed in the Rajya Sabha
 yani abhi to jo bhi intyrect tex vasula ja rahaa tha, yaa rajya apane-apane tareeke se tex waite lagaate the wo sab khatm ho jayega
 The tax being given from 30 to 35 percent will come down to 17 to 18 percent, as excise tax, service tax, VAT, sales tax, entertainment tax and luxury tax will end
 congress se sahyog kii ummidadrasal mangalvaar ko sansad bhawan ke baahar congress ke saansad abhishek manu sighavi ne kaha, 'agar koi baadha nahin ai to jiesti vidheyak ko buudhvaar ko manjuuri de di jaaegi'
 The government on Tuesday distributed the amendment copies of the draft bill among members of the House
 vahiin bijepi or congress ne pehle hi apane sadasyon ko buudhvaar korajyasabha main maujuudrahane ke nirdesh die hai, jahaan jiesti vidheyak par bahes or matdaan hone kii ummid he
 The Vajpayee government had laid the foundation of GST, it is worth mentioning that the foundation of GST was laid 16 years ago by the Vajpayee government
 360 degree main ghumte hue buudhvaar ko rajyasabha main paas hone kii ummid he, kyonki 16 saal pehle vaajapeyi sarkaar alpamat main thi to pesh nahin kar saki or saal 2009 main manmohan sarkaar ne koshish kii, to gaiyr-congressi shasit rajyon ne virodh kar diya
 Now that the BJP has majority governments at the Center and most states, the Modi government softened its stance to take the Congress along in the Rajya Sabha
 jiske baad congress se sahmati ban gai
 Expecting benefit from GST to common man: Every country will get its benefit as soon as a tax scheme is implemented in the country
 iske lagu hote hi 20 se zyada indiarect tex khatm honge or sirf teen tarah ke (central, state or integrated jiesti) tex hi lagenge
 Central government will levy Central GST tax
 state jiesti tex rajya sarkaar vasuulegi, orintegrated jiestiko kendra rajya donon vasuulenge, kyonki ye do rajyon ke bich kaarobaar hone par lagegaa
 If some things are cheap, then some are expensive too
 The question will be in every mind that what will be cheap and what will be expensive with the implementation of GST? Eating in restaurants, consumer durables such as air condition, microwaves, machinery goods and freight will be cheaper, while canned food products, tea, coffee, mobile bills, credit card bills, jewelery and textiles will become expensive
 jiesti lagu hone se growth rate main ijapha sambhavajiesti lagu hone ke baad do se teen baras tak mahangaai bad bhi sakati he
 However, the government claims that after the implementation of GST, the growth rate will increase by 2%
 haalanki sach yah bhi he ki puri duniya main jiesti lagu karne ke baad hue chunaavon main koi bhi sarkaar dobaaraa nahin chuni gai he, kyonki shuruaati saalon main kuch chijen mahangi ho jaati hai, iskaa khamiaja sarkaar ko bhugatna padataa he
 Jafihat Jokihat MLA Sarfaraz Alam has resigned from the party and from the membership of the assembly
 unke party chhodane ke baad se yah tay mana ja rahaa he ki wo arriya sansadeey kshetra se hone vaale upachunaav main argedy ke ummindwar banenge
 The seat is vacant after the death of Araria MP Mohammad Taslimuddin
 taslimuddin sarfaraj alam ke pita the
 Sarfaraz Alam is a JD (U) MLA for the last two terms despite his father being in RJD
 argedy ke netaa or purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ise janata dal you ko jhatka bataa rahe hai
 He said that more mlas will break now
 saath main nitish kumaar par bhi tanj ksaa ki main to abhi baccha hum
 However, after Taslimuddin's death, everyone knew that the RJD would give tickets to his son Sarfaraz
 kyonki us ilaake main taslimuddin kaaphi lokapriy netaa the or unke bete ko tikat dene se sahanubhuti bhi milegi
 In the last Lok Sabha election, RJD candidate Taslimuddin defeated BJP by one lakh 48 thousand votes, then Janata Dal u also contested separately
 is baar bihar main ek sansadeey or do vidhansabha ke upachunaav 11 march ko hone hai
 After resigning from Janata Dal U, MLA Mohammad Sarfaraz Alam has also resigned from the membership of the assembly
 sarfaraj alam ne istife ke baad kaha ki hamaare upar janata kaa pressure tha isliye maine istipha diya
 a decision will be taken at the behest of the public
 unhone kaha ki ham koi bade netaa nahin hai, taslimuddin sahab ne sangharsh kiya tha aise nahin pahunche the, hamako kahin koi ghutan nahin hai
 But what the public wants and public pressure was and i resigned
 aage arriya se janata agar kahegi to chunaav ladenge, main jadyu par koi coment nahin karuunga wo vakt or halaat batayega
 After the resignation of Sarfaraz Alam, JDU has said that it does not matter to JDU
 pravaktaa rajeev ranjan ne kaha ki chunaav ke vakt is is tarah ke istife hote rahete hai, lekin rashtriya janata dal ne apana aadhaar kho diya he
 The government is working under the leadership of Nitish Kumar and with the popularity of Narendra Modi, we will win the upcoming by-elections from Araria
 argedy galatafahami main he ki sarfaraj ke jane se koi bahut kuch hasil kar paaenge, ye kis tarah kaa jod-tod he ki aapane ek dal ke vidhayak ko sansad kaa tikat kaa pralobhan dekar todaa
 This will not make any difference in the election

 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday will launch a new campaign among Delhiites to tackle and prevent dengue-chikungunya
 is abhiyaan ke tahat khud mukhyamantri apane mantriyon or sarkari adhikariyon ke saath machharon ko panpane se rokane ke liye kaary karenge
 Chief Minister Kejriwal said that this campaign will start from September 1, in which people will check whether a dengue mosquito is growing anywhere around their house
 jaagrukta campan ke elaan ke saath hi mukhyamantri ne 2015 se 2019 tak ke dengue or chikangunia ke aankade bhi pesh kiye
 He claimed that in just four years, the outbreak of dengue and chikungunya in Delhi reduced by 80 percent
 aankadon ke mutabik 2015 main 15,867 cese, 60 mautein hui jabaki 2018 main 2,798 maamle saamne aae, vahiin 4 logon kii maut hui
 During the press conference at the Delhi Secretariat, Kejriwal said, "A comprehensive campaign will be launched from September 1 to get rid of dengue and chikungunya
 is abhiyaan kaa naam rakhaa jayega das hafte, das baje, das minute
 Every Sunday, dengue strikes
 ham dilli ke sabhi logon se apil kar rahe hai ki aapako har sande ko das baje keval das minute dene hai

 'arvind Kejriwal said,' Dengue mosquito is only in clean water
 saaf pani agar thode din ke liye ikattha ho jaae or usko badla na jaae to us saaf pani ke andar dengue ke andey paidaa hote hai
 Those eggs are converted into mosquitoes within 8 to 10 days
 agar ham 8 din se pehle us pani ko badal den or us andey ko nasht kar den to machhar paidaa hi nahin hoga
 It does not take more than ten minutes for every Sunday to check your house
 puure ghar main jaakar dekhnaa he ki kahin gamale main, cooler main, koi choti jagah pani to jamaa nahin ho rahaa
 If this happens, pour or change it or put some oil in the cooler etc
 so that the eggs which are there do not survive
 'arvind kejariwal ne bataaya ki wo khud bhi har ravivaar ko das baje apane ghar kii jaanch karenge
 Like the Chief Minister, all ministers, mlas and officials will also be involved in this campaign
 saath hi campan ko dilli ke kone-kone main pahunchane ke liye resident welfare association or schuli bacchon kii madad bhi lee jaaegi
 At the time of Modi wave in 2014, just before the election, there were speculations that Rahul Gandhi could contest from Rae Bareli instead of his old Amethi seat
 aise main khud sonia gandhi amethi shift ho sakati hai
 According to sources, Rahul was also given such a proposal within the party
 daleel ye di gai ki kumaar vishwaas, modi lahar, smriti irani kii daavedaari or congress ke khilaaf maahaul main amethi ke bajaay raibareli se jeetna rahul ke liye aasaan rahegaa
 But Congress President Rahul bluntly refused saying that he lost or won, but will not change the seat
 baad main kade mukaable main rahul kareeb ek lakh voton se jeet gaye
 There was a significant reduction in the margin of Rahul's victory
 saath hi haar ke baavjood kendriya mantri smriti irani lagaataar amethi main dakhal de raheen hai
 At the same time, Sonia has handed over the command of Congress to Rahul
 aise main ek baar phir kayaas tej ho gaye hai ki rahul amethi ke bajaay 2019 main raibareli kaa rukh kar sakate hai
 The strategy of Congress president, Rahul is not comfortable with this
 vah saafe kar chuke hai ki ve amethi chhodane vaale nahin, lekin 18 april 2018 ko jab sonia ke saath raibareli jila vikaas samanvay evam anushravan samiti kii samiksha baithak main sonia ke saath rahul ke bhi saath jane kaa kaarykram bana
 Both were to stay at Bhumeu Guest House in Rae Bareli, while the Janata Darbar's program was made
 aise main kayaason ne phir jor pakad liya ki sonia ab raibareli kii bagdor rahul ko saunpane ja rahi hai
 Actually, an assembly of Rahul's Amethi parliamentary constituency comes in the Salon Rae Bareli district
 isliye saansad kii haisiyat se rahul ko sonia ke saath is baithak main hissaa lene kaa kaarykram banaaya gaya
 Even before this, such programs were made inside, but for this fear Rahul himself avoided going with Sonia
 aakhirkaar is baar aadhikarik taur par kaarykram ban hi gaya, media ko bataa bhi diya gaya
 Meanwhile, the same discussion intensified once in the market of rumors in the area
 amethi pehali pasandsutron ke mutabik, jab rahul tak ye baat pahunchi, to khud rahul ne sthaneey netaaon se saafe kar diya ki unhen apana aglaa chunaav amethi se ladanaa he
 Amethi is his first choice
 aise main agar main baithak main jaaoongaa to media or janata main yahi sandesh jayega ki main aglaa chunaav raibareli se laduunga
 Often such reports also come in the media
 aise main media bhi isi baat ko tool degaa
 Then what? Rahul did not attend the meeting and Sonia participated alone
 haa, rahul ne is baat kaa khaasaa khyaal rakhaa ki un par kshetra ke vikaas kii samiksha baithak main nahin jane kaa aarope na lage
 That is why Sonia Gandhi continued to participate in the meeting and here Rahul kept visiting Salon all the time
 uske baad aakhir main rahul-sonia alag alag amethi ke fursatganj airport pahunche or dilli ke liye ravaanaa ho gaye
 Just before the Modi government was targeted, Congress President Rahul turned to the media and attacked Modi for the first cash crunch
 rahul bole-ye sab puraa connected he, logon ke paise jeb se nikaale or neerav modi ko de die, har taraf aarthik sankat he, logon kaa paisa nahin mil paa rahaa he, log sirf line main lage hai, har koi phir se pareshaan he jabaki modi chup hai
 After this, Rahul also quipped on the news of Amit Shah's Rae Bareli tour
 sawaal tha ki amit shah apni party kii jameen talashne raibareli aa rahe hai? sawaal sunakar rahul pehle to vyangatmak lahaze main muskuraae
 Then said - the question is that Nirav Modi, Rafael Scam, Petroleum Scam in Gujarat and Amit Shah's son convert 50 thousand to 80 crores, corruption cases are coming up every day
 magar piem kisi par kuch nahin bolte hai, mujhe agar sansad main 15 minute mil jaae to khadey nahin ho paaenge sansad main, har taraf bhrashtachar failaa hua he

 Keb (central Advisory Board of Education), the largest advisory committee on education on the government's no-detention policy, has recommended to the government that the decision be left to the state governments to decide whether to follow the policy from class five
 haalanki chauthi kaksha tak yah niti anivaary bani rahegi
 Under the No Detention Policy, states cannot take any student's examination till 8th grade
 isse kai rajyon main naaraazgi he, kyonki unhen lag rahaa he ki chaatr padhai nahin karte
 Therefore, from 9th grade they find it difficult to pass the exam
 no ditension policy shiksha ke adhikaar kanoon kaa hissaa he or ise badalane ke liye kanoon main parivartan karnaa hoga
 It is likely that the government will bring this amendment only in the winter session of Parliament

 keb kii baithak main rajyon ne ye bhi kaha ki koi niti hone kii vajah se ye pataa nahin chal paa rahaa he ki chaatr kya sikh paa rahe hai
 Now in the name of learning income in the law, it will also be interpreted that the children of which class should have at least how much information
 no ditension policy ke tahat rajya 8veen kaksha tak kisi chaatr kii pariksha nahin le sakate
 This has led to resentment in many states, as they feel that students do not study
 lihaaja, 9veen kaksha se unhen pariksha main paas hona mushkil hota he
 The No Detention Policy is a part of the Right to Education Act and changes have to be made in the law
 sambhaavna he ki sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main hi sarkaar yah sanshodhan lekar aegi
 The comments keb ne sarkaar se sifarish kii he ki artii act main badlaav kar ye rajyon par chhod diya jaae ki vah is niti ko lagu rakhen yaa hataaen, lekin chauthi tak koi rajya bacchon kii pariksha nahin le paaegaa, yani no ditension par paanchavin ke baad hi rajya koi faisla kar sakate hai
 In the meeting of Keb, states also said that due to any policy, it is not possible to know what the students are learning
 ab kanoon main larning outkam ke naam par ye bhi vyakhya kii jaaegi ki kis kaksha ke bachche ko kam se kam kitni jaankaree honi chahie

 haryana ke jatland main 30 vidhansabha sitenzatland main BJP pratyaashee vipakshi chakravyuuh menharyana kii siyasat main kareeb 30 fisadi jat samudaay kisi bhi party ko chunaav jitaane or kisi bhi sarkaar ko giraane kii takat rakhte hai
 This is the reason that the political axis of Haryana has been revolving around the Jat community for a long time
 vidhansabha chunaav ke liye mahaj chand din hi baaki hai or haryana main jatland ilaake main aani vaali siton par vipakshi chakravyuuh ko bhednaa bijepi ke liye badi chunauti bani hui he
 Jatland seats: Jats have good influence in about 30 assembly seats in Rohtak, Sonipat, Panipat, Jind, Kaithal, Sirsa, Jhajjar, Fatehabad, Hisar and Bhiwani districts in Haryana
 isi ke chalate is ilaake ko jatland kaha jaataa he
 The Jat community decides to win and win on the seats here
 jatland kii in 30 siton par bijepi ke bade diggajon ko bhi kadi chunauti mil rahi he, jiske chalate party ke jat netaa apane ilaake se baahar nahin nikal paa rahe hai
 bjp's Jat leader Ghee bjp's Jat fraternity minister Oom Prakash Dhankhar is stuck in a tough fight in Apni Badli and Narnaund seat, Captain Abhimanyuk and state president Subhash Barala in Tohana seat
 iske alaava gadhi saanpala, kiloi, beri, maham, kaithal, ailanabad jaisi kai vidhansabha siton par bijepi ummidavaar ko vipakshi pratyaashiyon se kadi chunauti mil rahi he
 BJP has a direct contest with JJP on some seats and Congress on some
 jat samudaay par kiskaa kya daanv?haryana ke jatland main bijepi ne mahaj 20 jat ummidavaaron ko utaara he
 On the other hand, Congress has expressed confidence in Jats for Haryana's return to power and has handed over the election of Haryana Chief Minister to former Chief Minister Bhupendra Singh Hooda
 congress ne 27 jat ummidavaaron maidan main utaara he to dushyant chautaala kii party jejepi ne 34 jat pratyaashee par daanv khelaa he
 Apart from this, around 30 Jat candidates are contesting from INLD
 jatland kii 10 siten bijepi ne jiti thibataa den ki pichley vidhansabha or haal ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi jatland se judi siton par vipaksh kaa siyaasi tilism nahin tod pai thi
 In the last election, out of 30 seats of Jatland, BJP could win only 10 seats
 jat votaron ne pichley chunaav main bhale hi bijepi kaa khulkar samarthan na kiya ho lekin haryana main jat votaron kii andekhi mumkin nahin he, yahi vajah he ki party ne subhash baraala ko pradesh adhyaksh banaaya or opi dhankhad or captain abhimanyu jaise kaddavar jat netaaon ko cabinet main jagah di
 Despite this, in the Lok Sabha elections held this year, BJP could not lead in Jat dominated assembly seats
 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne vipaksh kaa supada saaf karne ke baavjood jat bahul vidhansabha siton par bijepi pichad gai thi
 One of these seats was Narnaud which is the constituency of bjp's Jat leader and cabinet minister Captain Abhimanyu
 jabaki duusare jat netaa or cabinet mantri om prakaash dhanakad kii seat badali main bhi yahi haal tha
 Similarly, BJP was lagging behind in Garhi sampla-kiloi, Beri and Maham
 isi ke chalate bijepi ke ye diggaj apane hi durg main ghire hue najar aa rahe hai

 The relationship deteriorated to the point that Shabnam left her husband's house and started living in her maternal home
 udhar avarul ko samaaj ke log taane dene lage ki patni ko kyon nahi laate
 Under the pressure of society, Avrool would repeatedly visit his in-laws to convince his wife, but every time he felt disappointed
 patni pariwarik kalah se itani tang ho gai thi ki ab vah pati ke ghar janaa nahin chaahati thi
 Many times the panchayat sat, but instead of becoming the case, it got worse
 avarul kii mohabbat ab nafrat main badal chuki thi
 This time he came to Darbhanga after fixing something
 usne tay kiya tha ki shabnam ko pehle pyaar se samajha kar ghar chalane ke kahegaa or agar wo nahin maani to vah apni bacchee ke saath shabnam or uske parivaar ko khatm kar degaa
 Will shoot himself later

 During this time some buyers also came but the matter did not happen

 uske baad avarul ne apni is khatarnaak sajeesh kaa khulaasa kiya to police waalon ke hosh ud gaye
 The police have filed a case against him under the Arms Act and jailed him
