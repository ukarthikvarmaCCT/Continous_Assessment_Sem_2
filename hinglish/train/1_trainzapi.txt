 sansad main naagarikta (sanshodhan) vidheyak kaa paarit hona nishchit taur par mahatma gandhi ke vichaaron par mohammad ali jinna ke vichaaron kii jeet hogi
 Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said this on Sunday
 tharur ne kaha ki dharm ke aadhaar par naagarikta dene se bharat "pakistan kaa hindutv sanskaran" bhar banakar rah jayega
 The former Union Minister also alleged that the BJP government is targeting 'one community' and is not harboring the oppression of the people of that community in the same conditions as compared to other religions
 tharur ne samachar agency ko die saakshaatkaar main kaha ki agar vidheyak ko sansad ke donon sadanon dwaara paarit kiya bhi jaataa he to unhen vishwaas he ki supreme court kii koi bhi bench bharat ke samvidhan kii mul bhaavana kaa 'ghor ulanghan' nahin hone degi
 Tharoor said, "it is a shameful job of the government that refused to discuss the framing of National Refugee Policy last year, which i proposed as a private member bill and private with the then Home Minister, Minister of State for Home and Private Was shared " unhone aarope lagaaya ki achaanak unhone sharnaarthiyon ko naagarikta dene ke liye aage badhkar kaam kiya he, jabaki vastav main ve moolbhoot kadam bhi nahin uthaanaa chaahate jo antarrashtriya kanoon ke tahat sharnaarthi darja tay karne main sudhaar yaa sharnaarthiyon se acha vyavhaar sunishchit karne ke liye aavashyak he
 Tharoor said, "it is clear that this is just a devious political move to target a community in India
" isse ham pakistan kaa hindutv sanskaran bhar rah jaaenge
 Asked about the Congress' stand on the bill, Tharoor said, "although i am not the official spokesperson of the party, i believe that all of us in Congress believe that the Citizenship Amendment Bill is not only for Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution It is against the basic spirit of equality under discrimination and not discriminating on religious grounds, but also an attack on the conception of India
 "unhone kaha ki bharat kaa swatantraaa sangram is aadhaar par bant gaya ki kya dharm ke aadhaar par rashtriyata tay kii jaae or jin logon kaa us siddhant main vishwaas tha unhone pakistan kii avadharana kii vakaalat kii
 Tharoor said, "mahatma Gandhi, (jawaharlal) Nehru, Maulana (abul Kalam) Azad, Dr
 Ambedkar, to the contrary, believed that religion had nothing to do with nationality
" unhone bharat kii avadharana banaai or unhone sabhi dharmon, kshetron, jatiyon or bhashaaon ke logon ke liye swatantra desh kaa nirmaan kiya
 "he alleged that this basic idea of india is reflected in the constitution by which BJP wants to be defrauded
 is tark ke bare main poochne par ki naagarikta kaa aadhaar dharm nahin ho saktaa he, tharur ne kaha ki bijepi ne bharat main raashtra ke sambandh main pakistan ke sansthaapak mohammad ali jinna ke vichaaron ke jad jamaane kaa rasta saaf kiya he jahaan dharm rashtriyata main samahit he or aisa karke ve mahatma gandhi, nehru, vallabhbhai patel, aaazaad, ambedkar or unke samay ke swatantraaa senaniyon kii bharat kii us avadharana ko khandit kar rahe hai, jiske liye unhone ladaai ladi thi
 He said that the bill is against the historical heritage of Hindus which they take pride in
 tharur ne kaha, "swami vivekanand ne chicago dharm sammelan main 1893 main kaha tha ki vah us desh ke bare main baat kar gauravanvit mahasoos kar rahe hai jahaan har desh or dharm ke log atyaachaar sahane ke baad sharan pate hai
 " vaigyanikon ne ek nai khoj main prithvi jaise lekin isse kai guna bade grahon (super-arth) par aise 'nishiddh' padaarthon kii khoj kar lee he, jo grah par jivan ke anukool vaataavaran kaa nirmaan karte hai
 According to this study, the transfer of heat from planets to planets that resemble the earth accelerates and creates a powerful magnetic field
 super grahon kii sataha thos hoti he or dravyaman prithvi kii tulana main bahut adhik hota he, isliye vaigyanikon ne inhen 'super arth' naam diya he
 Scientists at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPIT) have discovered some compounds in the core of super Earth using mathematical models that are not possible to manufacture according to the classical laws of chemistry
 emipiaiti ke mukhya vaigyanik artim ganove ke anusaar, 'ham kah sakate hai ki magnesium, oxigen or silicon ne prithvi or prithvi samaan grahon par rasayan shaastra kaa aadhaar rakhaa he

 The comments is tarah kaa dabaav 'glice 832si' jaise super arth par paaya gaya he jo prithvi se paanch guna adhik vajani he
 In addition, this pressure was also present on the Mega Earth 'kepler-10c' which weighs 17 times more than the Earth

 Researchers used a completely new method for this and investigated various structural compositions of the 'magnesium-silicon-oxygen system' at five to three million atmospheric pressures

 bharat kii sabase badi jivan beemaa company 'bhartiya jivan beemaa nigam' (LIC) ko share bazaar main utaarne yani exenjon par listing kii sarkaar taiyaari kar rahi he
 The government is making such preparations to speed up its disinvestment program and raise huge funds this financial year
 elisi ko yadi stock exenjon par soochibaddh kiya gaya to yah bazaar mulya ke hisaab se aasaani se desh kii number ek soochibaddh company ban sakati he or maujuuda diggaj reliance industries ko peeche chhod degi
 Actually, LIC has a capital base of just Rs 5 crore, but its profit or valuation surplus was Rs 48,436 crore in FY 2017-18 and asset under management 31
 11 lakh karod rupee kaa tha
 Because of this, lic's IPO will be listed at a very premium
 indian express ne sutron ke hawaale se khabar di he ki yah prakriya abhi shuruaati charan main he or sarkaar ke ucch adhikariyon main isko lekar charchaa hui he
 The proposal is to sell a small part of the government-controlled entity by first bringing an IPO and then selling the government stake
 gauratlab he ki sarkaar ne bajet main yah ghoshnaa kii he ki soochibaddh companiyon main public holding kam se kam 35 fisadi kerani hogi
 Two years ago, the government listed IPO of General Insurance Corporation and New India Assurance in the stock market two years ago
 jab kisi company ko pehali baar share bazaar main listed kiya jaataa he to uske liye initial public ofer yani ipo jari kiya jaataa he
 In order to bring LIC into the stock market, firstly the LIC Act needs to be changed
 gauratlab he ki abhi tak elisi ko sarkaar share bazaar main utaarne se shaayad is vajah se hichakati rahi he, kyonki abhi tak share bazaar main sarkari companiyon ko ubaarane main elisi kii mahatvapurn bhoomika rahi he
 In fact, when shares of a government company fall due to over-selling, or buyers are low, it is often seen that LIC buys shares of these companies, which gives them support
 elisi ke paas lakhon karod rupee kii nakadi he jiskaa vah kai sadhano main nivesh karti he
 LIC has invested around Rs 4,34,959 crore in debentures and bonds and Rs 3,76,097 crore in several infrastructure projects
 saal 2018-19 main elisi ko share bazaar main nivesh se 23,621 karod rupee kaa munafa hasil hua he
 The company had invested Rs 68,621 crore in the stock market during this period
 elisi philhal bhartiya beemaa niamak or vikaas praadhikaran (IRDAI) ke regulation ke tahat aata he, haalanki iskaa sanchaalan 1956 ke elisi act ke tahat hota he
 The government will have to change this act before its listing in the stock market

 CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury, the country's main leftist party, will not get a third chance to go to the Rajya Sabha
 dilli main sipiem kii kendriya samiti kii mahatvapurn teen divasiy baithak main shaamil party ke sutron ke mutabik kendriya samiti ne party mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ko teesri baar rajyasabha bheje jane ke prastaav ko khaarij kar diya he
 The CPM has taken this decision due to the lack of necessary numbers to send Yechury to the Rajya Sabha
 sutron ke mutabik yechuri ko bengal main rajya sabha seat se ladvane kii yojana par kendriya samiti ne dobaaraa vichaar karte hue ab us faisle ko taal diya he
 At the same time, with the help of Congress, the possibility of sending Yechury to Rajya Sabha has also been ruled out

 The party's Bengal unit also supported Yechury to be given a third chance in the Rajya Sabha, but the cpm-led politburo rejected that proposal

 Film Name: Haramkhoradirector: Shlok Sharma Star Cast: Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Shweta Tripathi, Trimala Adhikari, Mohammad Irfan Duration: 1 hour 34 minutes Certificate: u / a Rating: 2 starabhintanwajuddin Siddiqui film 'haramkhor' was ready with the censors almost three years ago and was censored
 Along with some other issues, there was a delay in getting released, however, the film was shown in many film festivals
 Hai and Nawazuddin Siddiqui have also received the Best Actor Award for this film at the New York Indian Film Festival, the film is set to release, let's review
 kahaneeyah kahani madhya pradesh ke chote se gaanv main besd he jahan skool teacher shyaam tekchand (navazuddin siddiki) bacchon ko ganit padhaata he
 In her class, a 15-year-old girl named Sandhya (shweta Tripathi) also studies, on which Shyam has a special eye
 skool ke baad camel, shaktimaan ke saath-saath sandhya bhi shyaam ke ghar tution padhane jaati he
 Despite his wife being at home, Shyam has a relationship with the minor Sandhya, while nothing goes right in Sandhya's house
 or sandhya kaa sahpaathee camel bhi sandhya ko pyaar karne lagata he or use pyaar kaa izhaar karne ke liye kai prayaas karata he
 This story gets a different outcome that you will have to watch the film to know
 kamjor kadiyanfilm kii editing kaaphi teetar-bitar si najar aati he jisaki vajah se ise dekhte hue aap conect kar paane main mushkil mahasoos karte hai
 In the film, you get to see a lot of raw and real location shooting and story but there is a special audience watching such films and this film does not reach a large number
 film kesencerhone ke baad ise dekhte vakt aapako disclemur bhi dikhaae jate hai to screen ke upar alag tarah kaa frem saamne aata he or disturb bhi karata he
 The track of the father and daughter relationship in the film seems a bit incomplete, which if written better, the film would have looked a bit more interesting
 jaaniye aakhir film ko kyon dekh sakate henfilm kaa patakatha chote shahar ke skool or vahaan ho sakane vaali ghatnaon kii taraf prakaash daalati he jo ki aankh kholane kaa kaam kar sakati he

 The box office film is releasing at a time where on the one hand Dangal is already doing an average business of at least 3-4 crores every day, on the other hand 'ok Jaanu' and Hollywood film 'xxx' are also released simultaneously
 Due to which, the business and footfall of 'haramkhor' film can be greatly affected
 vaise film kii laagat (pramotion sang) bahut hi kam bataai ja rahi he or agar yah film munafa kamaati he to filmmekars kaa manobal rielity par besd filmein banane ke liye barkaraar rahegaa

 Before the Lok Sabha Election in Bihar, there was some turmoil in the NDA on Wednesday
 sitamarhi se jadyu ne apane nae ummidavaar kaa elaan kar diya he or usne dow varun kumaar kii jagahsunil pintu (sunil kumaar pintu) ko apana ummidavaar banaaya he
 In fact, before the nomination, Janata Dal United (JDU) candidate from Sitamarhi, Dr Varun Kumar returned his ticket and declared not to contest
 iske baad jadyu ke bheetar bhi gahamagahami shuru ho gai
 In a hurry, BJP leader Sunil Kumar Pintu was inducted into the JDU from the BJP and was then given a ticket from the Sitamarhi seat
 dow varun kumaar dwaara tikat lautaae jane ke baad nitish kumaar kii party janata dal united (jediu) ne bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke purv vidhayak or bihar sarkaar main mantri rah chuke sunil kumaar pintu ko sitamarhi se loksabhaa chunaav ke liye ummidavaar banaaya
 Jaduay leader Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh gave this information at a press conference in Patna on Wednesday
 khaas baat rahi ki press conference ke dauraan hi pehle sunil kumaar pintu ko jediu kii sadsyta dilaai gai or unke ummidavaari kii ghoshnaa kii gai
 Let us know that on Wednesday morning, news came that Varun has expressed his inability to meet Nitish Kumar and contest the election
 reports ke mutabik unhen na to janata dal united kaa or na hi bhaajapa kaa koi netaa bahut mahatv de rahaa tha
 They were therefore quite upset
 isliye unhone namakan se pehle hi tikat lautaa diya
 Let me tell you, there is voting in Sitamarhi on 6 May bihar main nitish kumaar kii jadyu, bhaajapa or ramvilas paswan kii lok janashakti party ke saath milakar loksabhaa chunaav lard rahi he
 BJP and JDU are contesting 17-17 and LJP six seats
 jadyu ne jin sunil kumaar pintu ko sitamarhi seat se apana ummidavaar banaaya he, raajnneeti main unka kad kaaphi bada he
 Sunil Kumar has been an MLA 4 times and also a minister in the Nitish government
 vah bijepi ke kaddavar netaa rahe hai
 He has been winning the assembly elections on BJP ticket till earlier
 unifarm civil code ko lekar koi thos prastaav to saamne he nahin, ye kya he, kaisaa hoga, kisi ko nahin pataa, jo bhi he lau kamishan ke solah sawaal hai
 Will the Uniform Civil Code come in to abolish triple talaq or polygamy
 kya uniform civil code kaa yah bhi matlab he ki anya samaajon ke reeti rivaajon ko lekar bhi bahes hogi
 Does the Hindu Code bill presently meet the criteria of the Gender Justice or will there be any amendment in it or is happening
 kya hindu code bill hi uniform civil code hoga yaa ek uniform civil code ke tahat alag alag dharmon ke reeti rivaajon kaa code banegaa
 i wish there was a draft
 baharhaal vitt mantri arun jetali ne fasebuk par post kiya he ki teen talaaq kii sanvaidhanik vaidhata kaa jo mudda he wo uniform civil code se alag he
 The constitution makers had hoped that under the Directive Principles of Policy, the state would try to enact a uniform civil law
 kai maukon par supreme court ne sarkaar se is par raay maangi he
 The government has repeatedly told the courts and parliament that any changes in personal law have been made only after consultation with all parties
 uniform civil code ke mudde par lau kamishan ne academik prakriya phir se shuru kii he
 Whether or not the Uniform Civil Code is possible today, even if it remains, the question arises that there is a need to improve the personal law of different communities
 ekarupata na bhi ho to bhi personal lau main sudhaar ek satat prakriya he
 Many provisions become outdated and useless over time
 sarkaron, vidhayikaon or samudaayon ko samay kii maang kaa jawaab dena padataa he
 Finance Minister Jaitley's answer can be read in many ways
 kya ve yah kah rahe hai ki kai samudaayon ke personal lau main sudhaar kii prakriya par vimarsh chal rahaa he
 So, apart from Muslim personal law, there is going to be a debate on reforms other than personal law
 kanoon ke maamle main unki vidwata jagaprasiddh he, agar ve bhi lau kamishan ke kuch sawaalon ko dekhenge to unke jaisaa vyakti shaayad hi pasand kare
 Yet the Finance Minister says that the Law Commission has initiated academic discussions
 lau kamishan ke sawaalon ko aap khud dekhiye or tay kiijie ki kya unke sawaalon se wo jhalak milti he jisaki baat vitt mantri kar rahe hai
 Is there a need to reform Muslim personal law only or in other personal law also
 lau kamishan main ek do hi sawaal hai jo duusare samudaayon kii baat karte hai
 Jaitley further wrote on Facebook that there are fundamental differences in religious behavior, customs and civil rights
 janm, god lene, viraasat, shaadi or mrityu se sambandhit dharmik sanskaron ko reeti rivaajon ke zariye bhi puraa kiya jaataa he
 Whether the right to talk about birth, adoption or inheritance or marriage, divorce etc
 should be guaranteed by religion or by constitution
 kya in maamalon main gair barabari ho sakati he, maanav sammaan se koi samjhauta ho saktaa he
 Some may say that personal law should not be in accordance with the constitution
 sarkaar kaa mat saaf he
 Personal law should be in accordance with the constitution
 teen talaak ko barabari or sammaan ke saath jeene ke aadhaar ke taraazoo par taula jayega
 The same scale will also apply to other personal laws
 agar vitt mantri jetali apane fasebuk post main yah bhi spasht kar dete ki anya personal lau kya hai jahaan ve teen talaak ko parakhane ke paimaanon ko lagu karnaa chaahate hai
 He has definitely talked about reforms in other personal laws but has given examples of only three divorces
 agar ve duusare samudaayon ke bhi udhaaharan dete to behatar hota
 This post of his should be carefully observed whether he is talking about termination of triple talaq or advocating for uniform civil code
 jetali kaa likhaa he
 Will have to do some hard work
 aakhir main unki is pankti ko bhi gaur se samajhane kii zarurat he
 Academic debate regarding the Uniform Civil Code can continue before the Law Commission
 jawaab is sawaal kaa khoja janaa he ki agar har samudaay kaa alag personal lau ho to kya ye sabhi personal lau samvidhan sammat nahin hone chahie
 We spoke to Vice Chancellor Faizan Mustafa Saheb of Nalsar University of Law, Hyderabad on Friday in response to this question
 kuch sawaal or rah gaye the
 Meanwhile, Nivedita Menon has written an article in Hindu on this
 nivedita menon ke lekh se bhi kuch sawaal banate hai
 Like they said, is there a gender justice in the Hindu Code bill? Is that the same model or will it also improve? Will all personal law's gender justice practices be compiled in one place? Will the provision of Hindu Undivided Family be abolished under the UCC? Will all citizens of India be governed by the Uniform Succession Act? vitt mantri jetali or nivedita ne baar baar gender justise shabd kaa istamaal kiya he
 This means that the law should be such that women get the right to equality
 duusari baat he hindu sanyukt parivaar ke praavdhaan ko samaapt kar ek samaan uttaradhikaar ke kanoon laane kii baat ko bhi alag se samajhane kii zarurat he
 Another question emerges from Nivedita's article that what should be the better arrangement for marriage according to Gender Justice
 nikaah main muslim auraton ke liye meher kii rakam tay hoti he
 Nivedita Menon has asked that if such a system does not exist in Hindus, will it be applicable to other communities under Uniform Civil Law as well
 vitt mantri kehete hai lau kamishan ke saamne jaakar bahes karen lekin lau kamishan ne jo sawaal website par rakhe ve behad buniyadi hai or is bahes kaa vyapak rup pradaan nahin karte hai
 This is my opinion
 tamaam lekhon main aap goa ke uniform civil code kaa zikr sunenge
 We also want to discuss this separately
 hindu akhbaar main nivedita menon ne likhaa he ki goa main 1939 main Portuguese Civil Procedure Code (1939) of Goa lagu hua tha
 It is neither uniform, nor does it lead to gender justice
 alag-alag dharmik samudaayon ke liye shaadi ke kanoonee praavdhaan alag hai
 According to Nivedita Menon, the customs and practice of Hindus have been recognized in Goa
 jisamen simit tareeke se hinduon ko bahuvivaah kii anumati bhi he
 The comments kya vaaki aisa he
 The Civil Code of Goa ensures wives of all communities a fifty percent share in all types of properties
 vyavhaar main hota he yaa nahin maaloom nahin
 The Government of India has also made such laws
 jo betiyaan, patniyaan or saheliyaan twitor-fasebuk par hai, agar vahiin post karen ki unke pita kii sampatti main kuch mila he yaa nahin to jaagarukta bhi failegi
 Muslim women already have such rights from Hindu women
 zaraa ve bhi post karen ki vyavhaar main unhen kuch miltaa bhi he yaa nahin
 (this news has not been edited by the NDTV team
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) kya is vakt jo hindu code bill he wo gender justise kii kasautiyon par khara utarataa he yaa usamen bhi kisi prakaar ke sanshodhan kii baat hogi yaa ho rahi he
 Will the Hindu Code Bill be the Uniform Civil Code or will the Code of customs of different religions be made under a Uniform Civil Code
 kaash koi draft hota to baat hoti
 However, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley posted on Facebook that the issue of constitutional validity of triple talaq is different from the Uniform Civil Code
 samvidhan nirmaataaon ne ummid jataai thi ki niti nirdeshak siddhanton ke tahat rajya uniform civil lau banane kii koshish karegaa
 On several occasions, the Supreme Court has sought opinion on this from the government
 sarkaar ne baar-baar adaalaton or sansad se kaha he ki personal lau main amuman koi bhi badlaav sabhi pakshon ke saath vichaar vimarsh ke baad hi hote rahe hai
 The Law Commission has resumed the academic process on the issue of the Uniform Civil Code
 uniform civil code aaj sambhav he yaa nahin, ise rahane den to bhi ye sawaal uthta hi he ki vibhinn samudaayon ke personal lau main sudhaar kii zarurat he
 Even if there is no uniformity, improvement in personal law is a continuous process
 samay ke saath kai praavdhaan puraane or bekaar ho jate hai
 Governments, legislatures and communities have to respond to the demands of time
 vitt mantri jetali ke is jawaab ko kai tareeke se padhaa ja saktaa he
 Are they saying that the process of reforming the personal law of many communities is under discussion? to kya muslim personal lau ke alaava bhi anya personal lau ko lekar sudhaar par bahes hone ja rahi he
 His scholarship in the matter of law is well known, if he too looks at some questions of the Law Commission, then a person like him would hardly like
 phir bhi vitt mantri kehete hai ki lau kamishan ne academik vimarsh kii shuruyaat kii he
 Look at the Law Commission's questions yourself and decide if their questions give a glimpse of what the Finance Minister is talking about
 kya sirf muslim personal lau main sudhaar kii zarurat he yaa anya personal lau main bhi
 The Law Commission has only two questions that deal with other communities
 jetali ne fasebuk par aage yah bhi likhaa he ki dharmik vyavhaar, reeti rivaaj or naagarik adhikaar main buniyadi antar hote hai
 Religious rites related to birth, adoption, inheritance, marriage and death are also performed through customs
 kya janm, god lene yaa viraasat yaa shaadi, talaak aadi ko lekar jo adhikaar kii baat hoti he unki guarantee dharm se honi chahie yaa samvidhan se
 Can there be equality in these matters, there can be a compromise with human dignity
 kuch log kah sakate hai ki personal lau ko samvidhan ke anusaar nahin hona chahie
 The opinion of the government is clear
 personal lau ko samvidhan ke anusaar hi hona chahie
 Three divorces will be weighed on the basis of living with equality and respect
 yahi paimaana anya duusare personal lau par bhi lagu hoga
 If Finance Minister Jaitley had also made it clear in his Facebook post what other personal laws are there where he wants to implement the criteria for testing triple talaq
 unhone zarur anya persolan lau main sudhaar kii baat kii he lekin udhaaharan sirf teen talaak kaa hi diya he
 It would have been better if they had given examples of other communities as well
 unke is post ko dhyaan se dekha janaa chahie ki ve teen talaak kii samaapti kii baat kar rahe hai yaa uniform civil code kii vakaalat kar rahe hai
 Jaitley has written
 thodi mehnat to kerani padegi
 Finally, this line also needs to be understood carefully
 uniform civil code ke sambandh main academik bahes lau kamishan ke samaksh chalati rah sakati he
 The answer to this question is to be discovered that if every community has a separate personal law, should not all these personal laws be constitutional
 hamane shuukravaar ko nalsar uniwarsity of lau, hyderabad ke vaais chancelar faizan mustafaa sahab se sawaal jawaab ke andaaz main is par baat kii thi
 Some questions were left
 is bich nivedita menon ne hindu main ek lekh likhaa he is par
 Some questions also arise from Nivedita Menon's article
 jaise unhone kaha he ki kya hindu code bill main gender justise he? kya vahi model he yaa isamen bhi sudhaar hoga? kya sabhi personal lau kii gender justise prathaon kaa ek jagah sankalan kiya jayega? kya usisi ke tahat hindu andivided family ke praavdhaan ko samaapt karnaa hoga? kya bharat ke sabhi naagarik ek samaan uttaradhikaar kanoon se shasit honge? Finance Minister Jaitley and Nivedita have repeatedly used the term Gender Justice
 matlab yahi hua ki kanoon aisa ho ki auraton ko barabari kaa haq mili
 Secondly, there is a need to understand the need to abolish the provision of Hindu joint family and bring laws for equal succession
 nivedita ke lekh se ek or sawaal ubharta he ki gender justise ke anusaar shaadi kii behatar vyavastha kya ho
 The amount of mehr is fixed for Muslim women in Nikah
 nivedita menon ne poocha he ki aisa system hinduon main nahin he to kya uniform civil lau ke tahat ye anya samudaayon main bhi lagu hoga
 The Finance Minister says go and argue before the Law Commission, but the questions put by the Law Commission on the website are very basic and do not provide a comprehensive form of this debate
 ye meri apni raay he
 In all the articles, you will hear about the uniform civil code of Goa
 ham iske bare main bhi alag se charchaa karnaa chaahate hai
 Nivedita Menon has written in the Hindu newspaper that the Portuguese Civil Procedure Code (1939) of Goa came into force in 1939 in Goa
 yah na to uniform yani samaan he, naa hi isse gender justise hota he
 The legal provisions of marriage are different for different religious communities
 nivedita menon ke anusaar goa main hinduon ke reeti rivaaj or chalan ko manyata di gai he
 In which Hindus are allowed polygamy in a limited way
 tippaniyan Is that really so goa kaa civil code sabhi samudaayon kii patniyon ko sabhi prakaar kii sampattiyon main pachaas fisadi kii hissedari sunishchit karata he
 Whether it is in practice or not is not known
 bharat sarkaar ne bhi aise kanoon banaae hai
 The daughters, wives and friends on Twitter, Facebook, will also spread awareness if they post whether something has been found in their father's property
 muslim mahilaon ko aise adhikaar hindu mahilaon se pehle se hasil hai
 Just post whether they get anything in practice or not
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) The government has repeatedly told the courts and parliament that any changes in personal law have been made only after consultation with all parties
 uniform civil code ke mudde par lau kamishan ne academik prakriya phir se shuru kii he
 Whether or not the Uniform Civil Code is possible today, even if it remains, the question arises that there is a need to improve the personal law of different communities
 ekarupata na bhi ho to bhi personal lau main sudhaar ek satat prakriya he
 Many provisions become outdated and useless over time
 sarkaron, vidhayikaon or samudaayon ko samay kii maang kaa jawaab dena padataa he
 Finance Minister Jaitley's answer can be read in many ways
 kya ve yah kah rahe hai ki kai samudaayon ke personal lau main sudhaar kii prakriya par vimarsh chal rahaa he
 So, apart from Muslim personal law, there is going to be a debate on reforms other than personal law
 kanoon ke maamle main unki vidwata jagaprasiddh he, agar ve bhi lau kamishan ke kuch sawaalon ko dekhenge to unke jaisaa vyakti shaayad hi pasand kare
 Yet the Finance Minister says that the Law Commission has initiated academic discussions
 lau kamishan ke sawaalon ko aap khud dekhiye or tay kiijie ki kya unke sawaalon se wo jhalak milti he jisaki baat vitt mantri kar rahe hai
 Is there a need to reform Muslim personal law only or in other personal law also
 lau kamishan main ek do hi sawaal hai jo duusare samudaayon kii baat karte hai
 Jaitley further wrote on Facebook that there are fundamental differences in religious behavior, customs and civil rights
 janm, god lene, viraasat, shaadi or mrityu se sambandhit dharmik sanskaron ko reeti rivaajon ke zariye bhi puraa kiya jaataa he
 Whether the right to talk about birth, adoption or inheritance or marriage, divorce etc
 should be guaranteed by religion or by constitution
 kya in maamalon main gair barabari ho sakati he, maanav sammaan se koi samjhauta ho saktaa he
 Some may say that personal law should not be in accordance with the constitution
 sarkaar kaa mat saaf he
 Personal law should be in accordance with the constitution
 teen talaak ko barabari or sammaan ke saath jeene ke aadhaar ke taraazoo par taula jayega
 The same scale will also apply to other personal laws
 agar vitt mantri jetali apane fasebuk post main yah bhi spasht kar dete ki anya personal lau kya hai jahaan ve teen talaak ko parakhane ke paimaanon ko lagu karnaa chaahate hai
 He has definitely talked about reforms in other personal laws but has given examples of only three divorces
 agar ve duusare samudaayon ke bhi udhaaharan dete to behatar hota
 This post of his should be carefully observed whether he is talking about termination of triple talaq or advocating for uniform civil code
 jetali kaa likhaa he
 Will have to do some hard work
 aakhir main unki is pankti ko bhi gaur se samajhane kii zarurat he
 Academic debate regarding the Uniform Civil Code can continue before the Law Commission
 jawaab is sawaal kaa khoja janaa he ki agar har samudaay kaa alag personal lau ho to kya ye sabhi personal lau samvidhan sammat nahin hone chahie
 We spoke to Vice Chancellor Faizan Mustafa Saheb of Nalsar University of Law, Hyderabad on Friday in response to this question

 Some questions were left
 is bich nivedita menon ne hindu main ek lekh likhaa he is par
 Some questions also arise from Nivedita Menon's article
 jaise unhone kaha he ki kya hindu code bill main gender justise he? kya vahi model he yaa isamen bhi sudhaar hoga? kya sabhi personal lau kii gender justise prathaon kaa ek jagah sankalan kiya jayega? kya usisi ke tahat hindu andivided family ke praavdhaan ko samaapt karnaa hoga? kya bharat ke sabhi naagarik ek samaan uttaradhikaar kanoon se shasit honge? Finance Minister Jaitley and Nivedita have repeatedly used the term Gender Justice
 matlab yahi hua ki kanoon aisa ho ki auraton ko barabari kaa haq mili
 Secondly, there is a need to understand the need to abolish the provision of Hindu joint family and bring laws for equal succession
 nivedita ke lekh se ek or sawaal ubharta he ki gender justise ke anusaar shaadi kii behatar vyavastha kya ho
 The amount of mehr is fixed for Muslim women in Nikah
 nivedita menon ne poocha he ki aisa system hinduon main nahin he to kya uniform civil lau ke tahat ye anya samudaayon main bhi lagu hoga
 The Finance Minister says go and argue before the Law Commission, but the questions put by the Law Commission on the website are very basic and do not provide a comprehensive form of this debate
 ye meri apni raay he
 In all the articles, you will hear about the uniform civil code of Goa
 ham iske bare main bhi alag se charchaa karnaa chaahate hai
 Nivedita Menon has written in the Hindu newspaper that the Portuguese Civil Procedure Code (1939) of Goa came into force in 1939 in Goa
 yah na to uniform yani samaan he, naa hi isse gender justise hota he
 The legal provisions of marriage are different for different religious communities
 nivedita menon ke anusaar goa main hinduon ke reeti rivaaj or chalan ko manyata di gai he
 In which Hindus are allowed polygamy in a limited way
 tippaniyan Is that really so goa kaa civil code sabhi samudaayon kii patniyon ko sabhi prakaar kii sampattiyon main pachaas fisadi kii hissedari sunishchit karata he
 Whether it is in practice or not is not known
 bharat sarkaar ne bhi aise kanoon banaae hai
 The daughters, wives and friends on Twitter, Facebook, will also spread awareness if they post whether something has been found in their father's property
 muslim mahilaon ko aise adhikaar hindu mahilaon se pehle se hasil hai
 Just post whether they get anything in practice or not

 harish ravat ek bade netaa hone ke saath jis kshatriya samaaj se aate hai, matadaata sankhya ke lihaaj se wo nainital loksabhaa kshetra kaa sabase bada varg he
 There are about 18 lakh voters in this Lok Sabha constituency, about 18 percent of them are Kshatriyas, about 15 percent of Brahmins, 19 percent of scheduled castes and tribes, about 32 percent including Muslims and other minorities and 16 percent are voters belonging to other castes
 nainital seat se bijepi pratyaashee ajay bhatijay bhatta brahman samaaj se aate hai
 He also lost the election from his hometown Ranikhet seat
 ajay bhatta kaa vyaktigat taur par janata ke bich samvaad na hona bhi unki kamajori mana jaataa he
 On the other hand, the candidate of Bahujan Samaj Party can also become a problem
 basapa ne bhi rajesh dube ke rup main ek brahman chehre ko maidan main utaara he
 BSP supremo Mayawati has also rallied in Rudrapur and sought support for her candidate
 unhone yahaan dalit varg ko dhyaan main rakhte hue aarakshan kaa mudda uthaaya tha
 This alliance of dalit-brahmins may also prove negative for Ajay Bhatt
 2014 ke chunaav main basapa pratyaashee laiq ahamed ko 59 hajaar vot mili the
 However, other big leaders have rallied in support of Ajay Bhatt, from PM Narendra Modi to Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, while Harish Rawat is going alone among the people without top leadership, which is believed to be in favor of Ajay Bhatt
 Used to be
 is sabake baavjood nainital seat kaa itihaas or harish ravat kaa kad ajay bhatta ke bajaay harish ravat kii majbootee ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 During the election campaign, Congress candidate Harish Rawatgram Panchayat started politics politics from his village in Almora
 block pramukh or gram pradhan kii jimmedaari sambhalate hue harish ravat ne 1973 main youth congress ke jiladhyaksh kaa kaarybhaar sambhala or is tarah shuruaati jivan se hi wo congress se jud gaye
 Harish Rawat is a member of the National Executive of Congress since 1980 and is currently the General Secretary of the organization
 ravat kii chunavi raajnneeti bhi kaaphi puraani he
 He first won the Lok Sabha election in 1980 on the Congress ticket from almora-pithoragarh Lok Sabha seat when Uttarakhand was a part of UP
 almoda va haridwar se sansad pahunchate rahe hai harish ravatiske baad 1984 va 1989 main bhi harish ravat isi seat se saansad bane
 He again won the Lok Sabha elections in 2009 after being a Rajya Sabha MP from 2002 to 2008
 haalanki, ravat ne yah chunaav haridwar seat se jeeta, lekin 2014 main unki patni renuka ravat yah seat haar gayi
 Although in 2016, Harish Rawat was made the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand in place of Vijay Bahuguna, but in 2017 Harish Rawat also lost the Assembly elections from Haridwar seat
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan congress pratyaashee harish ravatub loksabhaa chunaav main unhone phir nainital kaa rukh kiya he, jahaan aazaadee ke baad se bijepi teen baar (1991, 1998 va 2014) baar jiti he
 Since the first election held in 1957 in Nainital seat, so far, no party other than Congress has won
 1999 se lagaataar chaar baar jeet darj ke baad congress ko 2014 main purv mukhyamantri bhagat singh koshyari ne jhatka diya tha, jinhone 6,36,769 vot hasil karte hue congress ke karan chand singh baba (3,52,052) ko paune teen lakh se zyada maton se haraaya tha
 But this time the party has given their ticket to Ajay Bhatt, who is contesting against former Chief Minister and Congress veteran Harish Rawat, and this seat is to be voted on April 11 in the first phase

 karunanidhi ne mangalvaar ko aakiri saans lee
 Born on 3 June 1924 in a lower-class family in Tamil Nadu, this charismatic leader started his political career at a very young age
 ivi ramasami periyar kii vichaardhaara se prabhavit karunanidhi aadhunik tamilnadu ke shilpkaar maane jate hai
 In political life, he has done many things which are no less than precedent for any leader
 haalanki kai dashak tak tamilnadu kii janata ke dilon par raaj karne vaala netaa, dashakon tak uttar bharat ke logon kii aalochana kaa paatr bhi bana rahaa
 This was due to their persistence and opposition to Hindi
 gaur se dekhen to raajnneeti main karunanidhi kaa udai or shikhar par pahunchnaa bhashaa virodh ke naam par panpi raajnneeti se hi hua
 Karunanidhi's Chashma Raj came from Germany after a 40-day hunt
 Karunanidhi was born on 3 June 1924 in a lower-class family in Tamil Nadu
 jab karunanidhi bade ho rahe the, tamil samaaj main asamanta, jaateey bhedbhaav or dharmik paakhand ke khilaaf periyar kii raajnneeti majboot ho rahi thi
 Periyar had created a socio-political movement in Tamil Nadu
 ye andolan brahmanwad ke karmkand or dharmik paakhand ke khilaaf tha
 In 1937, there was a plan to introduce compulsory teaching of Hindi in non-hindi speaking states
 haalanki ahindi kshetron main iskaa jamkar virodh ho rahaa tha
 The southern states, in particular, could not digest the idea of promoting another language in their homes
 inamen tamilnadu sabase aage tha
 Devotees of Kollywood to Karunanidhi, the cancellation of films in Hindi, teaching Hindi in Tamil Nadu was taken like imposing Tamil on another language
 ise tamil asmita se bhi joda gaya
 At that time, Periyar logically opposed it
 tab periyar ke kai yuva anuyaayi bhi hindi ke khilaaf sadakon par utar aae
 Karunanidhi was also one of them
 wo kallakudi main yuvaaon kaa netritv kar rahe the
 For this, he also set up a youth organization
 kuch log ise dravid raajnneeti kaa pehla chaatr sanghathan bhi maanate hai
 At that time, he was only 14 years old
 andolan ke dauraan hinsa kii vajah se karunanidhi ko giraftaar bhi kiya gaya
 After this movement, Karunanidhi never looked back
 unhone filmi patakathaon or naatakon ke lekhan main dravid raajnneeti ke siddhanton kaa jamkar istemaal kiya
 Karunanidhi began to rule in the hearts of the people
 baad main wo vidhansabha bhi pahunche
 Karunanidhi did not lose any election in his lifetime until his death
 aazaadee ke baad bharat main hindi ko rashtrabhasha banane kii maang jor pakadaney lagi
 In the 60s, there was a nationwide movement against and in support of it
 gaiyr hindi bhashi rajyon khaskar tamilnadu main hindi ke virodh kaa andolan bahut vyapak or hinsak ho chukaa tha
 And among those who protested was Karunanidhi and his family
 wo kai baar alag-thalag bhi pade or vyapak aalochanaayen bhi jhela, lekin unhone hindi se kabhi bhi samjhauta nahin kiya
 Till the last days, Karunanidhi kept opposing Hindi
 jab bhi mauka mila khulkar hindi ke virodh main rahe
 Due to this aspect of political personality, people in Hindi speaking states never accepted Karunanidhi with his full form
 wo jitna hindi virdohi rahe, rashtriya raajnneeti kii sheersh pankti main aane ke baavjood hindi pattee ne bhi unka utana hi virodh kiya
 In a way, this contradiction of Karunanidhi's personality is interesting
 jaateey bhedbhaav kaa virodh karne vaala 'kalaignar', aajanm bhashaagat chuachhut maanata rahaa

 Bihar government minister Lallan Singh said that if the CBI had started an investigation into the railway tender case in 2008, then RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav would have been sentenced by now
 lekin tab upie sarkaar ne is maamle kii jaanch sibiai ko na dekar railway ko hi jaanch karne kaa jimmaa de diya
 In 2008, Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh, Minister of Water Resources in the Government of Bihar, first raised the issue of land in lieu of railway tender
 lalan singh ke paas us samaylalu prasad yadavake khilaaf saare dastaveji saboot the ki railway ne ranchi ke bnar hotel or bhubaneshwar ke railway hotel nijee haathon main dene ke evaj main patna main jameen lee he
 Lalan Singh said that this land belonged to Vijay Kochhar and Vinay Kochhar, owners of Chanakya Hotel in Patna and they got the tender of the railway hotel as well
 us samay tender ke badale jo jameen mili thi wo dilite marketing company ko di gai thi
 Whose mistress was Sarla Gupta and who was the wife of RJD leader Premchand Gupta
 ye jameen railway kaa hotel dene ke evaj main registry kii gai he isliye yah bhrashtachar kaa maamla banataa he
 Lallan Singh said that we handed over all the documents to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and explained the matter in detail
 logon kaa vishwaas tha ki manmohan singh nishpaksh jaanch karenge lekin baad main pataa chalaa ki railway mantralay ko hi jaanch de di gai
 Against which is accused of corruption
 yah lipa potee kaa maamla tha, us samay lalu prasad yadav sarkaar main the
 Today it was proved that the land belonged to Lalu Prasad Yadav
 us samay company ko madhyam banaaya gaya tha
 It was also clear that after 2011, all the shares of Delight Marketing Company came to Lalu Prasad Yadav's family and no one else was the shareholder of this company
 lalan singh ne kaha ki agar 2008 main hi is maamle kii nishpaksh jaanch karai gai hoti to ye karrwai usee samay ho gai hoti
 But today CBI is moving towards an impartial investigation
 lalan singh ne kaha ki is maamle main pukhta saboot he, jameen ke kagajaat hai
 There is evidence of writing the land from the people next to that land and given a job in lieu
 kuch aise log bhi the jo chaara ghotaale main gavaah the unki jameen bhi likhaai gai
 According to Lallan Singh, it is difficult to get RJD president Laloo Prasad Yadav in this case
 kyonki sibiai jis disha main nishpaksha ke saath bad rahi he usase lagata he ki yah antim parinti tak pahonchegi
 Lallan Singh says that Lalu Prasad Yadav has implicated his son in this case
 vinaash kaale vipareet buddhi agar lalu yadav ko apane bete ko raajnneeti main laana tha to is sampati ko tejasvi yadav ke naam karne kii kya jarurat thi
 It would have become Tejashwi Yadav's name as heir
 17wein asian games main bhartiya hockey team ko apane chir pratidwandvi pakistan ke khilaaf 1-2 se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The Indian team itself was responsible for this defeat, as they missed many excellent chances to score goals and also lost the match in the end
 pehle do quarter main koi gol nahin hua lekin pakistan ne tisare quarter main badhat hasil kii
 From his side, Mohammad Umar Bhutta scored in the 38th minute
 bharat ne chauthe quarter main barabari kii lekin pakistan ne turant hi javaabi hamalaa karke nirnaayak gol daag diya
 Nikin Thimmaiah (53rd minute) scored for India while Mohammad Waqas (54th minute) scored for Pakistan
 match vastav main romaanchak tha or ummid ke mutabik upmahadweep kii donon tiimon main dilachasp muqabla dekhne ko mila
 Both teams played flamboyant hockey and presented an unmatched sample of their skills
 donon tiimon ne ek duusare se behatar pradarshan karne kii koshish kii, lekin aakhir main sardaar singh kii aguwai vaali team maayoos hokar stadium se baahar nikali
 The reason for India's defeat was missing many chances to score goals
 khaskar ramandeep singh ne kai maukey haath se jane die, jabaki rakshapankti bhi kuch avasaron par dabaav main bikharati hui najar ai
 With this victory, Pakistan has somehow secured the top spot in Pool B, while conditions have become tighter for India
 vah ab pool bi main duusare sthaan par hi rah saktaa he or aise main use semifinal main dakshin korea kii majboot team se bhidana pad saktaa he
 But for this also, India will have to overcome the low-ranked but dangerous China in their last pool match on Saturday
 roopinder paal singh ke chotil hone ke kaaran penlti carnor kii jimmedaari ve aar raghunatha par thi lekin is draig flikar kaa kharaab pradarshan jari rahaa or unhone maukey ganvaae
 Ramandeep Singh's trapping inside the Pakistani circle was also not good and he missed three chances to score at least
 duusare quarter main akashadip singh kaa shot sidhe golkeeper imran bat ke paas chalaa gaya
 Pakistan also got chances to score goals
 vakaas ke paas duusare quarter main sunaharaa mauka tha jab unke saamne keval bhartiya golkeeper pi aar srijesh the lekin unka shot baahar chalaa gaya
 In the first two quarters, both India and Pakistan tried unsuccessfully on a penalty corner
 tisare quarter main vakaas kaa shot srijesh ne roak diya lekin bhutta ne ribound par gol karke maujuuda champion ko badhat dilaa di
 India then adopted an aggressive attitude and kept the Pakistani defense very busy in the fourth and last quarter but could not score
 danish mujtaba 49wein minute main barabari kaa gol daagne kii sthiti main pahunch gaye the lekin kothajit singh ke paas par unka difallection pakistani golkeeper ne badi khubsuurati se roak diya
 India's continued efforts resulted in the 53rd minute when Thimmaiah scored an equalizer on Kothajit's cross but India's happiness did not last long and Waqas scored the decisive goal with a reverse hit
 pakistan teen jeet se ab pool bi main top par chal rahaa he
 He will face weak Oman in his last match

 rape ke aaropee narayan sai ne apana cese kamjor karne ke liye kathith rup se jo 13 karod rupee jutaaye the, aakhir unka raaj kya he? kya is deal ke peeche kuch bade naam bhi shaamil hai? kya unhen jaanboojh kar surat police bachaa rahi he? agar nahin to phir kya ek maamuli sab inspector akelaa 13 me se 5 karod rupee kii deal kar saktaa he? phir is rakam main se sirf 5 karod rupee baraamad hue
 Where did the remaining 8 crore go? After all, what is the truth of this bribe case of 13 crores? sub-inspector CM Kumbhani of Crime Branch of Surat Police is accused that he had made a deal of five crores with Narayan Sai to buy Surat Police
 deal is baat kii ki paanch karod ke badale surat police narayan sai ke khilaaf chal rahaa balaatkaar kaa cese kamjor kar degi or cese se jude baaki aropiyon ko pakadaney main dhilaai bartegi
 Now the question is, can a single sub inspector alone do such a big job? That too when he is neither the IO or Investigating Officer of the case nor directly connected with the investigation
 phir hai profile cese hone kii vajah se surat police ke tamaam aalaa afasaron kii bhi is maamle par paini najar he
 The Commissioner of Surat Police says that Sub Inspector Kumbhani was alone in this conspiracy
 yani baaki police afasar is deal main shaamil nahin the
 But the question is that there was no top police officer involved in the deal, then for whom was the one crore rupees as advance under the deal, which the police seized from the car near Gandhi Circle in Surat on the evening of 12 December? After the police recovered the remaining four crores on the spot of the accused
 ab zaahir he ye puure paanch karod rupye sirf or sirf surat police ke liye hi the
 And the police commissioner himself has accepted this
 in paanch karod kii baramadagi se saaf he ki deal tay ho chuki thi or usee ke baad ye paanch karod rupye surat pahunche
 According to sources, apart from the Surat Police, Narayan Sai's operatives from the judiciary and the jail administration had settled the deal with the help of some big contacts and some amount of advance has also been paid to them
 sutron ke mutabik narayan sai ke liye ye tamaam deal ek netaa kar rahaa tha or vahi 13 karod kii is sajeesh kaa asli master mind bhi he
 Surat Police has formed an investigation team of 6 IPS officers to know the truth of this 13 crore bribe
 ye jaanch team na sirf nyaaypalika, sarkari doctor or jail prashasan kii bhoomika kii jaanch karegi balki surat police ke senior afasaron ke role ko bhi tatolegi
 Narayan Sai tried to buy Surat Police for five crores
 par inamen se akele 4 karod wo 42 boriyon ke badale de rahaa tha
 In fact, in these 42 sacks kept in the Surat Police shop, there are all documents, computers and hard disks related to Narayan Sai
 narayan chahta tha ki police raddiyon se bhari 42 boriyaan malkhane main rakh de or asli boriyaan use lautaa de
 Surat police raided his ashram in Ahmedabad during Narayan's absconding and seized a total of 42 sack documents from there
 in dastavejon main tamaam kagajaton ke alaava narayan sai kaa computer, laptop, hard discs, sidi sab kuch shaamil tha
 In fact, the Wagon r car from which one crore rupees has been received, a bag was also kept in the same car
 vah bori thik waisi hi thi jaisi police ke kabje main narayan sai kii dastavejon se bhari 42 boriyaan hai
 The sack recovered from the car had a magazine printed on Asaram Bapu
 darasal ye sample bori thi
 The hint was that 42 similar sacks would come, which would be replaced by those 42 sacks kept in the police shop

 The film's hero The Rock and director Brad Peyton are telling the special things related to the film: Your film is being released after the San Andreas Nepal earthquake, did you consider that releasing the film about the tragedy is insensitive
 Wouldn't it? The Rock: We talked a lot about it

 But you can also understand the uncertainty associated with nature
 aap jaanate hai, ham ek acchhee film bananaa chaahate the, hamen pataa tha ham kya bana rahe hai
 When the earthquake struck Nepal, we all were shaken and everyone started thinking what could be the next best step? The first thing we did was put the marketing of the film on hold
 phir warner bros ne kaaphi paisa raahat kaary main daan main diya
 After that we thought how else can we help? How can people become aware? We chose the marketing plan of the film to make people aware

 Brad, how can you make a film above a natural disaster without taking advantage of the tragedy? Brad Peyton: The filmmaker, in this film, my focus is not on earthquakes but also on its characters
 jab aap film bana rahe hote hai to aapako unke saath chalanaa padataa he ki is ghatana se unke upar kis tarah kaa asar padaa
 How do they handle an incident
 aapako inhen baton par focus karnaa padataa he
 i always knew that earthquakes are the real thing and they cause havoc, so i did not want to introduce any weak thing in it
 main yahaan aapako samvedansheel kahani bataanaa chahta tha, kahin-kahin daraana bhi chahta tha
 It is a sensitive subject but our film is also about entertainment
 film kii tone bahut hi samvedansheel he or is baat ko lekar he ki bukamp aate hai

 The major achievement of the two countries during the visit of US President Barack Obama to India was that the stumbling block in the implementation of nuclear deal has been removed
 haalanki us vakt yah kaise hua or fine print kya he, ye nahin bataaya gaya
 Now the Ministry of External Affairs has answered 19 frequently asked questions
 is sawaal-jawaab se jo nikal kar aata he vah yah ki baat sirf is par hui he ki haadase kii surat main jin bhartiya kanoonon ko videshi companiyaan roda maan rahi hai, unki asal main vyakhya kaise hogi
 From the answers to these questions, it seems that in reality in the event of an accident in the nuclear reactors, the compensation will have to be paid to the operator running the reactor
 kanoon main yah praavdhaan he ki agar oparator chaahe to vah saamaan or eendhan aapurti karne vaale par harjane ke liye daawa kar saktaa he
 But the thing to understand here is who will be the operator
 asal main ye oparator sarkari company newclear power corporation of india (NPCIL) he or sarkaar kaa kahana he ki haadase kii surat main ye harjaana zarur maangega
 Moreover, this claim will also depend on whether there is a provision in the agreement with the company supplying the goods
 yah samajhnaa mushkil nahin he ki bhartiya naagarik adaalat main mukademe sarkari company ke khilaaf kar sakate hai, jitna tay kiya gaya he utana harjaana sarkari company to apane nagarikon ko degi, lekin vah spalaayar se harjaana maange yaa nahin yah sarkaar par nirbhar karegaa or bhartiya naagarik videshi companiyon se harjaana nahin maang paaenge
 However this provision is under section 46 of the Civil Nuclear Liability Damage Act 2010 and is accepted everywhere in the world
 jahaan tak 1500 karod ke insurance pool kaa sawaal he, vah bhi hamaare aapke tex ke paise se hi banegaa
 However, the government is claiming that the price of electricity from nuclear reactors will increase by a few cents
 is sab ke baavjood kaagaz par saaf kanoonee praavdhaan naa hone ke kaaran jeei or toshiba-vestinouse jaisi videshi companiyaan, jo saplir hai, vah philhal aashwast nazar nahin aa raheen
 The only thing the government has done here is the American demand to track nuclear fuel from beginning to end, which India did not accept, and the US backed off on it
 to in saare tathyon ko dekhne ke baad ant main phir sawaal vahi he ki asal main parmaanu samjhaute par kuch badla he? or agar haa to bharat do kadam aage badha he yaa do kadam peeche hataa he

 shuukravaar ko surat main smriti ne kaha ki rahul gandhi, hamaare adhyaksh amit shah samet kisi bhi netaa ko bahes ke liye chun sakate hai
 Asked about Rahul's siege to the Prime Minister on various issues, Smriti said, 'prime Minister Narendra Modi himself has said this, Rahul Gandhi should come forward and talk on any issue
 vah sansad main yaa hamaare saamne bol sakate hai
 The Union Minister said that if not in Parliament, he can come for a debate on television
 hamaare rashtriya adhyaksh (amit shah) tak usamen bhaag le sakate hai
 He (rahul) is free to choose any of our party workers, we are ready for debate but do not bring any book or piece of paper with him
 darasal, smriti irani yahaan apni sarkaar ke chaar saal puure hone par uplabdhiyon ko ginava rahi thim

 bataa den ki kendriya mantri smriti irani or rahul gandhi ke bich kadi raajnneetik pratispardhaa dekhne ko milti-rahati he

 End of day happiness! Phew! # praguediaries The second ODI against Australia was not very special for Mahendra Singh Dhoni in batting (5 runs)
 haalanki eden gardens par utarate hi unhone ek badi uplabdhi hasil kar lee
 Actually, Dhoni went to play in his 300th ODI for Team India
 dhoni ke kariyar ke overol vanade kii baat karen, to dhoni kii kul vanade sankhya- 303 ho chuki he
 This is because Dhoni played three odis for Asia XI in 2007
 un 3 maichon ko bhi dhoni ke vanade kariyar main joda gaya he
 In this context, Dhoni completed the 300th match of his ODI career against Sri Lanka on 31 August
 tab match shuru hone se pehleviraat kohli team india ke purv captain ko na sirf smriti chihn bhent kar sammanit kiya, balki unhone jo kuch bhi kaha, isse unke phens kaaphi imotional ho gaye
 Virat, while presenting a moment to Dhoni among all the players in the field, said - 90 percent of us started our career as your captain
 aap hameshaa hamaare captain rahenge
 Dhoni is congratulated by Shikhar Dhawan

 eczit pole kii maane to in teenon rajyon main is baar bijepi ek badi takat ke rup main ubharegi
 It has been said in two exit polls that the BJP will be in power in Tripura, where the Left Front government has been in power for the last 25 years
 chunaav ayog ke adhikariyon ne bataaya ki teenon rajyon main matganana shanivaar subah aath baje shuru hogi
 Significantly, there was a vote in Tripura on 18 February, while in Nagaland and Meghalaya, the votes were cast on 27 February
 in teen rajyon main vidhansabha kii 60-60 siten hai, lekin kisi naa kisi kaaran se teenon main 59-59 siton par matdaan hua
 The votes of the assembly elections held in three states will be counted on Saturday
 meghalaya, tripura or nagaland main hue vidhansabha chunaavon se bijepi ne bahut ummiden laga rakhi hai, lekin sabase zyada intjaar tripura ke nateezon kaa he
 People want to see if the BJP can overthrow the Communist regime which has been in power for 25 years
 uttar purv ke rajyon kevidhansabha chunaavonke nattejey shesh bharat ke liye itane mahattvuparn kabhi nahin rahe, lekin bijepi kii in chunaavon main lagi takat or pradhanmantri narendra modi ke dauron ne ise bahut khaas bana diya he
 Everyone is waiting for the role of PA Sangma, former Speaker of Lok Sabha in Meghalaya
 tripura main bijepi gathbandhan karke chunaav ladi he to nagaland main bijepi ek seat se 31 seat tak pahunchane kaa sapana dekh rahi he
 The biggest battle is in Tripura
 lagaataar 25 varsh se raaj kar rahi sipiem ke liye yah jameen bachaane kii ladaai he to bijepi ke liye shunya se satta main pahunchane kii ladaai he
 Equiparty seats of last election in Tripura Vote percentage CPM 49 48
 1%INC 10 36
 5% CPI 1 1
 57 %BJP 0 1
 With an old vote of 54% and one and a half percent, the BJP has gone on to overthrow the CPM with 48 per cent of the vote, but it would be a miracle if it did

 Bollywood star Ranveer Singh's style and his fashion sense are always in the news
 apni aanevaali film 'kil dil'ke pramotion ke liye ranvir singh ne apane fishan sens kaa hi sahaara liya
 You have never seen this form of this star in front of the camera
 'kil dil' kaa gaanaa 'sweeta
 
 
 'release' tattoo of 'kill / Dil' on right hand, 'KILL' and 'DIL' on shoes of fluorescent color and not only the sleeveless t-shirt also got the name of his upcoming film
 film 14 november ko relies hone vaali he, or ranvir kaa ye rup dekhakar andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki wo is film ko pramot karne ke liye koi kor kasar nahin chodenge
 Apart from Ranveer, Parineeti Chopra, Ali Zafar and Govinda in the lead role in this film
 film 'bajirao mastaani' ke liye ganje hue ranvir in dinon hat pahanakar hi najar aa rahe hai
 Emotions are the cheapest in the world of Hindi cinema
 maanen apane beton par bepanaah pyaar udelti hai, shaadishuda auraton kii khushiyaan unke patiyon se bandhi hoti hai or dada-daadiyon ke paas apane pote-potiyon ko laad karne ke sivaa koi kaam nahin hota
 Our film industry has never worked deeply on topics like love, sorrow and sympathy

 adhikaron kaa haath se phisalana, shaareerik swasthya, ichchhaaon, maansik kshamtaaon ke shithil hone jaise umradraj logon se jude jatil muddon ko ghise-pite dhaanchon main dhaal diya gaya he
 For example, the self-sacrificing mother, the wise head of the village, the avenging mother-in-law, and the head of the household who run her own errands
 rosemara kii jindagi main badhati umr kaa hamaara anubhav kahin jatil rup main ho saktaa he, lekin parade par hamen atiranjanapurna bhoomikaayen di jaati hai yaa phir ajeebogareeb bhoomikaayen jaise ki film blike
 Such Indian films are rare, which are different from worn-out structures
 bujurgon ko bane-banaae bhaavnaatmak dhaanche se alag dikhaane vaali filmein to or bhi durlabh hai
 The Marathi film Astu (2013), which was screened during the 61st National Film Festival in Delhi on 29 June, is one of those rare films
 yah mile kaa pathar kahi jane vaali film he, kyonki yah banaavati bhavukta main fanse bina kai mushkil sawaal khadey karti haih jab aap prem ko pahchaanane kii kshamta kho dete hai, to duusare logon ko aapse kis tarah prem karnaa chahie
 What happens when memory gets weak
 or kisi ajanabi ke die gaye uphaar kii prakruti kisi hoti he
 This extraordinary film revolves around these same questions while avoiding false sentimentality
 isamen budhaape ke kaaran paidaa hone vaale maansik asantulan ke vishay ko smriti, prem, dukh or karunaa kii gahari khoj kii ore le jaaya gaya he
 Chakrapani Shastri from Pune is a retired Sanskrit professor
 unki badi beti ira niraashaa ke saath chupchaap unka maansik santulan bigadate hue dekhati he
 He is advised to put his father in an old age home
 lekin is tarah ke ashramon kii dayaneey dasha dekhakar vah faisla karti he ki vah apane pita ko apane or apane doctor pati ke ghar le aegi
 One day Ira comes to his house to bring his father with him
 ek jagah vah apni car khadi karti he or unase kahati he ki vah jaldi hi laut aegi
 This old child stumbles out of the car and he sees a man carrying his young daughter and an elephant
 vah bacchon ko hathi kii sawari kara kar roji kamaane vaala he
 Professor Shastri tweets
 ve hathi ke maalik ko 500 ru
 Points showing the note of
 ve hathi kii sawari karnaa chaahate hai
 There are now two children on the elephant's back: the daughter of the owner of the elephant, for whom the ride will become a memory and the old professor, who is probably riding his own memories
 hathi ke garib maalik ke liye yah ajeeb mushkil he
 He does not have a house of his own, but is riding a man who has a house but has forgotten the way back home
 baharhaal, hathi kaa maalik us buudhe ko raste main akelaa nahin chodta
 At daybreak, he takes the professor to his family's tent built on the banks of the river
 is bich shastri kaa parivaar behad pareshaan he
 The police are informed and several relatives are interrogated
 aakhirkaar professor shastri mil jate hai
 The elephant owner and his wife try to prove themselves innocent in front of the policeman
 unhen ek asahaay buudhe kii dekhbhaal karne ke badale main maafee maangani padati he
 We often see this disturbance in normal life and we wonder why someone would help someone without any benefit
 is film kaa shaayad sabase yaadgaar pal vah he, jahaan garib mahila, jo buudhe aadmi kii maa jaisi ban gai he, beti ko santvanaa detii he
 The ending of the film ‚Äî the moment that connects the two families going in different directions ‚Äî is very poignant
 yah film ek aise uphaar ko saamne rakhti he, jo aaj kii duniya main behad durlabh he or vah he dayaa or sahanubhuti, vah bhi bina kisi shart ke
 Genuine compassion, which is not limited to the boundaries of charity and makes us human in the true sense
 kuch aise mahatvapurn sawaal hai jinhen poochne ke liye astu hamen baadhya karti he
 Why are we not ready to accept this situation despite significant problems related to pathetic and inadequate facilities for old age and old age
 or bhartiya samskruti main vridhon kaa mahimamandan karne ke baavjood kya yah sahi nahin he ki vartmaan samskruti main yuvaaon kii zyada puja kii ja rahi he? kya is samay ham saanskrithik vismaran kaa shikaar ho gaye hai, jahaan ham sirf jivan ke ek chote-se hisse ko hi yaad rakh paa rahe hai? astu hamaare liye sawaal karne kaa ek namoona muhaiyaa karaati he ki yuva avasthaa paar karne ke baad hamaara kya hoga? hamen javaani kii mastiyon ke bare main to bahut kuch bataaya jaataa he, lekin yah nahin bataaya jaataa ki budhaape main kya hoga
 We do not need to teach the youth to look at their own inevitable old age with disdain

 This agency will decide later which agency will conduct this investigation
 tippaniyan The Supreme Court had also sought detailed information on the 1528 encounters in Manipur
 supreme court ne 'amikes curi' se un sab 62 maamalon kii states report maangi thi jinhen justise santosh hegade yaa enechaarsi ne farji bataaya tha
 The court had said that the army is free to conduct a court of inquiry in every case
 supreme court main daakhil yachika main encounter maamalon kii jaanch sibiai yaa esaiti se karaane kii maang kii gai thi
 The army is accused of carrying out fake encounters of around 1500 people between 2000 and 2012

 chhattisgarh puratathvik drushtikon se kaaphi mahatvapurn rahaa he

 They never give up

 In Delhi, the hopes of the BJP and the Congress are clouded in the storm of the Aayam Man Party
 kejariwal and company ko rajdhani kii janata ne 67 siton ke rup main prachand bahamat diya he
 On the other hand, the BJP, which was at stake in the Delhi elections, could not gather even enough seats to get the status of Opposition in the House
 uske teen ummidavaar hi jeet hasil kar paaen
 Everyone has been defeated in the storm of Kejriwal, from Jagdish Mukhi to Kiran Bedi
 duusari ore is aandhi main bijepi ke teen khilaadi angad kii tarah pair jamaaye rahe, lihaaja bijepi kaa dibba gol hone se batch gaya or party kii jholii main teen siten batch gai
 The victory of these three candidates saved the honor of bjp's surveyee Narendra Modi and kept flickering in Kejriwal's storm
 haalanki bijepi kii tarah congress ke ummidavaar muqabla nahin kar paae auraam aadmi partike ummidavaaron ke saamne dher ho gaye
 The party's account was also not opened and another bitter defeat fell in the neck of the Congress

 yah baat thodi vicitra-si nahin lagati? yahi ki aaj kareeb ek sadi ke baad bhi filmon or upanyaason main ek amit bhaavana ke taur par prem kii aadhunik packaging main ham usee puraani jagah par khadey hai
 The packaging remains intact in the new era, but the pack itself is empty
 aisi dukaanon kii kami nahin, jo prem kii sasti saamagree dhadlle se bech rahi hai
 Along with this, we are running towards those films which rarely show such a believable story, which tells that love is indelible and forever
 isi ke saath india today kaa sex survey 2016 bhi yah dikhaa rahaa he ki sthaayee prem kii kalpana dhire-dhire feeki padati ja rahi he
 The survey shows that this sentiment is rapidly eroding in the small towns of the country
 hamen us tir ke bare main kya kahana chahie, jo najuk dil kii paraton ko chirakar rakh detaa he
 How does love end? And why is it that whatever was seen solid and strong from above is disappearing in the air of small towns? But first some shocking figures
 survey kii report kahati he ki mahanagaron main (apane partner ke alaava) kisi duusare ke saath prem sambandh banane ke maamle apekshaakrit kam (10-12 fisadi) hai, jabaki tear-2 shrenee ke shaharon main apane saathi ke alaava kisi duusare vyakti ke saath prem sambandhon ke maamalon kaa pratishat apekshaakrit zyada he
 Ahmedabad tops the list of heartburn figures, where the number is 26 per cent
 iske baad number aata he kochi (21 fisadi) or ranchi (20
 5 percent)
 kuch saalon se gudgaanv bhi ek bade shahar kaa rup le chukaa he
 a few years ago while talking to some youth in a village adjoining this Gurgaon, i came to know that on Valentine's Day, they go to the mall in Gurgaon with their girlfriends, while their wives were in their homes
 aakankshaon kaa gaanv bhi ab gaiyr-metro shahar se zyada peeche nahin
 Extramarital affairs are no longer a new thing
 par in sab main jo baat nai he, vah he antarang sambandhon main paripurnataa yaa santrupti kii bhaavana
 This quest and desire for fulfillment has become the goal of life
 pehle kii peedhishaan or usamen bhi khaskar mahilaayein vivaah ke kathor bandhan main bandha jaati thim or jivan bhar unhen uskaa nirvaah karnaa padataa tha
 But like many other things, relationships have become an object of aspiration
 yah ek anwarat talash ho gai he
 But why has it become such an interesting subject that we are seeing such 'activities' now in non-metro cities, and even more interesting is why now people want to talk about it openly? This search for saturation is not complete in married relationships
 is tripti kii talash ke maamle main gaiyr-metro shahar aadhunik samay ke pratik ban gaye hai
 New things (pizza) and places (malls and cafes) are coming to Ranchi and Sholapur (and Jamshedpur and Durgapur)
 iske saath hi yuvaaon main khud ko nae jamaane ke hisaab se badalane kii chahat bhi paidaa ho rahi he
 In this fantasy of desires, they are imagining a life free from domestic bonds
 lekin sawaal yah he ki is tarah kii chahat khaas taur par gaiyr-metro shaharon main hi dekhne ko kyon mil rahi he? ek sambhavit kaaran yah ho saktaa he ki mahanagar main khud ko abhivyakt karne, kariyar banane, mouj-masti or khan-paan ke dheron vikalp uplabdh hote hai
 On the other hand, the situation is completely opposite in non-metro cities
 vahaan bheetar kii abhivyakti ke liye khud ko hi aage badhanaa hota he kyonki yahi ek cheez unki pahunch ke bheetar he
 This is the reason why they express their views more openly and appear more courageous
 khulepan kaa makasad khud ko abhivyakt karnaa or arthpurna bataanaa he
 For example, you can hear the people of Ahmedabad saying that there are many places other than Delhi and Mumbai, where there is life and possibilities, where you can do a lot
 baaki kii jindagi hamaari pahunch or pakad kii seemaa se baahar he, lekin kam se kam yah atmabhivyakti to apane haath main he
 The report of the sex survey shows that in the search for a bright future in non-metro cities, the incidence of running out of the quagmire of the current circumstances is happening fastest
 pune ke 31
 3 percent of respondents say that people are easily attracted to extramarital affairs
 ek se zyada logon se prem sambandh rakhane ke maamle main chandigarh or gudgaanv kaa naam sabase upar he
 Kochi topped in terms of bewafa partners and group sex
 gaiyr-metro shahar darasal shahar or gaanv ke bich kahi funskar rah gaye hai
 The habits and attitudes here lie between the village tea shop and the urban cafe Coffee Day
 vah gaanv kii saamaajikta ko to chhodkar aage nikal aayaa he, lekin shahar kii mukt saamaajikta main ghulne main sankoch bhi he
 Therefore, it is neither on this side, nor on that side
 in shaharon main ladkiyaan genes ke saath kurta top pahenti hai or ladke apni premicaon ke kaanon main juthi kasame khate hai kyonki ve maa-baap kii pasand se shaadi kii taiyaari kar rahe hote hai
 Sometimes it happens that their love takes the shape of marriage according to Indian tradition, which is called 'love and traditional marriage'
 lekin aamtaur par gaiyr-metro shahar abhi gramin niyamon or audyogic ichchhaaon ke mishran ke saath halki aanch par dhire-dhire khadbadane kii sthiti tak hi pahunch paae hai
 It has not boiled yet
 lekin sex survey kii yah maujuuda report ek bade badlaav kii khabar ban sakati he
 Some angry men and women are learning to differentiate between habit and desire
 us samaaj main jahaan aadaten daali jaati hai or chaahaton ko hatotsahit kiya jaataa he
 In non-metro cities, non-extramarital relations are increasing socially, yet they are increasing
 chennai main 37 fisadi log, jinhen prem kaa ehsaas nahin he or indore main 22
 5% of people who have fallen in love more than three times, are probably accepting the truth that if there is something permanent in the desire, it is agility ie the mind is not going to stick with one
 matlab, insaan kii yahi vaastavik fitrat he
 It also means that marriage is now just a system of sociality and property, in which the desires of intimate relationship with another do not disappear
 haalanki yah bhi sach he ki 'sachcha' prem vivaah bhi paaramparik vivaah kii tulana main zyada khushi kii koi guarantee nahin he
 But despite this, it definitely gives rise to the hope that both can get pleasure from each other
 haa, yah jaruri nahin ki vaisaa hi sukh mili, jaisaa vah chahta he
 Still it is available to some extent
 ranchi jaise gaiyr-metro shahar ke 25
 5 percent of the people say that they have no feeling of love
 lekin saath hi ve ek bahut badi us gaiyr-metro aabaadi kaa hissaa hai, jo vivahetar sambandhon main shaamil he
 Obviously, they are getting satisfaction elsewhere
 nishchit taur par us rishte main to nahin, jinamein unhen baandh diya gaya he
 Not at home, maybe in shopping malls
 lekin iske saath hi hamen yah bhi yaad rakhana chahie ki ek sanstha ke rup main vivaah ke tuutane kii ghatnaon main koi bada ijapha nahin hua he
 Having an intimate relationship with another person along with maintaining marriage can be a unique Indian trend
 isliye vivaah ke sthayitv or saath hi dil kii chanchalta ke bare main india today kaa sex survey agar kuch hakeekat bayaan karata he to vah yah haih uttardaata kisi duusare ke saath antarang sambandhon kii khatir apni shaadi todgaye ke liye taiyaar nahin
