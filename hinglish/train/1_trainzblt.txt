 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main narendra modi vaale netritv vaali bijepi ko maat dene ke liye pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee vipakshi dalon ko ek saath ekamanch par laane ke liye 19 janvari ko kolkata main raily karne ja rahi hai
 Congress president Rahul Gandhi including Akhilesh Yadav and Chandrababu Naidu are also likely to be involved
 jabaki congress ke chalate telugana ke mukhyamantri or tiares ke adhyaksh ke chandrashekhar raav manch saajha nahin karenge
 In such a situation, they will not be included
 darasal telugana ke siem kesiar gaiyr congress-gaiyr bijepi dalon ke saath fedral front banane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Recently he went to West Bengal and met Mamata Banerjee
 aise main ab mamata vipakshi dalon ko ekajute kar bijepi ko apni takat kaa ehsaas karnaa chaahati hai to kesiar usamen shaamil nahin ho rahe hai
 It is considered a blow to Mamta
 kesiar ke shaamil na hone ke peeche unke apane raajnneetik sameekaran hai
 Such political parties are coming together on Mamta's platform, from which KCR has a figure of 36
 isamen congress or tidipi mukhya rup se hai
 Congress is the main opposition party against TRS in Telangana
 haal hi main hue vidhansabha chunaav main congress tidipi ke saath milakar kesiar ke khilaaf chunaav maidan main utari thi, lekin vah jeet nahin saki thi
 The TRS came back to power last month after winning 88 seats in the 119-member Telangana Assembly and the Congress came second with 19 seats
 aise main kesiar kisi bhi surat main apane aapako congress se alag dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 For this reason, the main reason for not attending Mamta's rally is believed to be
 vahiin, odisha ke mukhyamantri or bijedy adhyaksh naveen patnayak ne india today mind rox kaarykram main kaha unki party kii niti saaf he, vah bijepi or congress se samaan duuri banaakar chal rahe hai
 They will not combine with either of the two parties
 patnayak ke bayaan se saaf he ki wo in donon gathbandhanon se alag apni siyaasi raah tay karenge
 Whether Mamata Banerjee will contest the Lok Sabha elections in alliance with Congress or not
 is par tasviir saaf nahin he
 Despite this, Congress is believed to be involved in Mamta's rally
 jabaki bengal kii pradesh congress cameti mamata ko lekar sakht tevar akhriyaar kiye hue hai
 This rally of Mamta Banerjee is attracting all the opposition parties, while the BJP which is ruling the center is also pulling its side
 bijepi ko yah dekhnaa he ki mamata kii yah raily vipaksh ko saadh paati he yaa nahin
 Right now TMC has 34 seats out of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal, while Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is trying to win all the 42 seats this time
 vahiin bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne 23 siton par jeet kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 The flames of Holika Dahan are very good

 In this festival of the victory of good over evil, the importance of colors is equally important for Holika Dahan
 ye manyata he ki vidhi vidhaan se holikaa puja or dahan karne se mushkilon ko khatm hote der nahin lagati
 On Holika Dahan, auspicious astrologers say that if you revolve around Holi by offering the right offerings, then it will not take long to fill the empty bag
 kyonki is baar holikaa dahan par behad shubh sanyog ban rahaa he
 Holika Dahan should be done on the full moon date of Phalgun month
 1 march ko subah 8 bajkar 58 minute se poornima tithi lag rahi he, lekin iske saath bhadraa bhi laga hoga
 It is a rule that Holika Dahan should not be done in Bhadra period
 shaam main 7 bajkar 37 minute par bhadraa samaapt ho jayega
 After this Holika Dahan will be auspicious
 holikaa dahan ke liye teen chizon kaa ek saath hona bahut hi shubh hota he
 Purnima Tithi, Pradosh Kaal and Bhadra should not be started
 is saal holikaa dahan par ye teenon sanyog ban rahe hai, isliye holi aanandadaayak rahegi
 This time, the auspicious time of Holika Dahan will be from 6
26 pm to 8
55 pm
 poornima hone se chandra kaa bal bhi surya ko milegaa, jiske kaaran is shubh grah sthitiyon ke bich agar aap vyapaar se jude faisle, dhan yaa shiksha sambandhi maamalon main agar koi faisla lete hai to aapako nishchay hi safalataa kii prapti hogi
 Not only this, if you have been troubled by some disease for a long time or the increasing number of enemies has increased your concern, then this time all your worries will be burned in the flames of Holika Dahan
 holikaa dahan kii puranic kathapuraanon ke anusaar daanavraj hiranyakashyap ne jab dekha kii uskaa putr prahlaad sivaay vishnu bhagwaan ke kisi anya ko nahin bhajata, to vah cruddh ho uthaa or antat usne apni bahan holikaa ko aadesh diya ki vah prahlaad ko god main lekar agni main baith jaaen; kyonki holikaa ko vardaan praapt tha ki use agni nuqasaan nahin pahunchaa sakati
 But just the opposite happened, Holika was consumed by burning and nothing happened to the devotee Prahlada
 isi ghatana kii yaad main is din holikaa dahan karne kaa vidhaan he
 The festival of Holi gives the message that in the same way, God is always present to protect his unique devotees
 kya he parikrama kaa mahatv?holikaa puja or dahan main parikrama behad mahatvapurn maani jaati he
 It is said that if your wish is stated while circling, it comes true
 parikrama ke alaava holikaa dahan main upalon ko jalaana bhi hota he behad jaruri
 You will have to decide according to your wish and reverence that how many dung cakes should be burnt
 parikrama or upale to aapke sapanom ko paravaan chadhayenge hi, prasad kii ahmiyat bhi kuch kam nahin
 Whether you are in need of happiness, prosperity or traveling abroad, the question is of a new job or you want the blessings of getting a child, Holika worship can also fulfill all your wishes

 His Adhikar Yatra may be decisive to realize his plans to garner support for the Adhikar rally to be held in Patna on 4 November
 isliye nitish pradarshnakariyon se bahut khize hue hai, jinhone unki rajnatik rup se mahatvakankshi is yatra ko virodh pradarshnon ke saaye main dhak diya or saare maamle ko prashasnic naakaami main tabdeel kar daalaa
 The Adhikar Yatra is obviously a direct indication of Nitish's political status
 upie sarkaar se mamata banerjee ke samarthan waapas lene ke ek din baad shuru hui is yatra se nitish ne un afvaahon ko janm de diya he ki ve bijepi ke bagaiyr bhi satta main kaayam rah sakate hai
 During the Adhikar Yatra, he had said in Bettiah, "I am ready to support whichever special state will give Bihar
 ’’ haalanki baad main unhone saaf kiya ki unka bayaan 2014 main agali sarkaar ke gathan ke sandarbh main diya gaya tha
 But he has not yet spoken of total support for the bjp-led government
 jaahir he, bijepi ko nitish kaa samarthan sashart he
 Meanwhile, on 1 October in Delhi, JD (U) national president Sharad Yadav shared the stage with Mamata Banerjee at a national rally against the central government's economic reform announcements, in which Mamata spoke of forming a federal front
 jedy (you) ke andar ke sutara bataate hai ki sangheey morche kaa vichaar nitish ke ‘secular agenda’ ke anukool he
 a senior JD (U) leader from Bihar said, "we feel that by fighting elections alone in Bihar, we will be able to increase the strength of our 20 mps in the Lok Sabha
" ham congress or bijepi donon se hi baraabar duuri banaae rakh sakate hai, or agar janadesh khandit rahaa to koun jane ki ham sarkaar banane main sakasham ho jaaen
 Incidentally, during his Adhikar Yatra, Nitish also visited the Lok Sabha constituencies of Bihar where mps belong to BJP
 haalanki adhikaar raily ko unhone puri tarah se jedy (you) kaa agenda banaae rakhaa he, jisamen gathbandhan sahyogi dur-dur tak kahin maujuud nahin hai

 On 30 September, BJP MP from Purnia, Uday Singh also disputed the state government's claims of good governance
 purniya main unhone vednaa raily kaa aayojan kiya tha jisamen acchhee-khaasi bheed juty thi
 In it, he lashed out at the state administration for 'corrupt, cheap and overbearing bureaucracy'
 ab tak bijepi ke kenrdriya netritv ne udai singh ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kii he
 The Chief Minister is stunned that the Adhikar Yatra has only served to malign his good governance

 It is clear that Nitish Kumar could not fulfill the expectations he had raised

 Nitish has blamed the opposition for instigating protests during the Adhikar Yatra, while opposition party RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav termed it as "an expression of genuine distrust of the people in the government"
 donon hi daawey bihar kii jamini hakeekat ko puri tarah se jaahir nahin karte, lekin ek baat tay he ki haalia pradarshnon ne nitish ke vishaal rajnatik abhiyaan par chadhe mulamme ko hataa diya he

 Let me tell you, Bobby Deol's work in the multi-starrer film Race-3 is being highly appreciated
 film main unka salmaan khan ke saath shartles seen charchaa main bana hua he
 Himachal Pradesh has got the sixth leader in the form of Jairam Thakur who took over as the Chief Minister
 wo pradesh ke 13wein or bhartiya janata party kii ore se tisare mukhyamantri banane vaale netaa hai
 Jairam, who belongs to the carpenter's house, has reached the assembly by winning the election for the fifth time from the Chachyot seat of Sagar (renamed after the re-election)
 rashtriya sevak sangh (aresas) or abivipi se unka gaharaa naata rahaa he, ab vah pradesh ke nae mukhiya ban gaye hai
 After winning the fifth consecutive time, the soft-spoken and hard-working Jairam, who reached the post of Chief Minister, has now taken command, but he will face many challenges as soon as he takes office
 ab tak ke raajnneetik safar main unhen jo jimmedaari mili usamen unhone kamyaabi hasil kii he lekin kya vah bataur mukhyamantri bhi safal rahenge, yah to vakt hi batayega
 But these 7 big challenges will be faced by them in the initial phase
 modi-shah ke faisle ko sahi sabit karnaa2014 ke baad jin bhi pradesh main bhaajapa satta main ai he, vahaan pradhanmantri narendra modi or party adhyaksh amit shah kii pasand hi chali he yani unhone apane pasand ke logon ko hi kaman saunpi
 In Himachal Pradesh too, modi-shah duo has chosen Jairam Thakur as the chief minister, leaving behind many big names
 aise main jairam ke paas sabase badi yahi chunauti hogi ki bataur mukhyamantri kamyaabi hasil karen or pradesh main sthaayee sarkaar chalaakar modi-shah kii pasand ko sahi sabit karnaa hoga
 Keeping the angry groups tight, before the election results, the BJP had declared Prem Kumar Dhumal as the Chief Ministerial candidate from the party, but Dhumal lost the election and had to be eliminated from the race
 iske baad dhumal ke alaava kendriya mantri jepi nadda, suresh bharadwaj or narendra baragata kaa naam bhi bhavi mukhyamantri ke rup main liya ja rahaa tha, lekin kai dinon tak kayaas lagaae jane ke baad jairam ne sabko peeche chhodte hue baaji maar lee
 He is considered quite junior among the aged leaders
 vaise bhi is chote se rajya main party main kai gut (dhumal gut or nadda gut) bane hue hai jo kahin na kahin nai sarkaar ko mushkil main daalane kii koshish kar sakate hai
 To prevent any such attempt from turning into reality will also be Jayaram's next big challenge
 saath main varisht netaaon ke saath talmail bithaana or sabko saath lekar unako chalanaa hi hoga
 With the formation of a new government of 53 thousand crores, there will be a festive atmosphere in the BJP state unit, but after this the government will have to play its innings with huge debt
 rajya par kareeb 53 hajaar karod rupye kaa karja he, jise chukaane ke saath-saath pradesh ko tarakkee kii raah par laana is nai sarkaar ke liye ek or badi chunauti he
 Not only is the financial situation in the state, but the administrative structure is also disturbed
 kharaab kanoon vyavasthadesh ke nakshe ke aadhaar par himachal chote rajyon main gina jaataa he, lekin yahaan bhi anya rajyon kii tarah apni hi samasyaayein hai
 It is also a very peaceful state according to nature, but law and order has deteriorated in the last few years
 aparaadh kii sankhya main teji se ijapha hua he
 The Goli rape and murder, Hoshiar Singh episode also brought the state into disrepute
 khud bhaajapa bhi congress kii pichhali sarkaar par kharaab kanoon-vyavastha ke liye doshi qaraar detii rahi he or chunaav main use khaasaa mudda bhi banaaya
 Now that the BJP government has come here, it will be the responsibility to curb the rising crime
 berogari dur karne kii chunautibhajapa ne apane chunavi ghoshnaa patr main 4-9-14 kii ghoshnaa, berogari dur karnaa, himachal ko bhrashtachar mukt banane ke saath-saath outsource karmchaariyon ke liye policy, sarkari vibhaagon, nigam bordon ko pension yojana ke liye pension yojana samiti gathan karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 Now this new government will have to fulfill these promises
 krishi bhoomi kaa muaavja doguna karnajayram thakur kii sarkaar ke paas kisaanon kii adhigrihith kii jane vaali krishi yogya bhoomi kaa muaavja raashi 2 se badhaakar 4 guna karnaa agali badi chunauti hogi
 Also, it will not be easy for the government to include tractors and pickups in the agricultural loan scheme
 sabakaa apana gharkentre sarkaar ke vaade ke tahat har kisi kaa ho apana ghar vaada 2022 tak diya janaa he
 It will be very difficult to arrange a house for every family of the state under Apna Ghar scheme
 wo bhi tab jab rajya karj ke boj tale dabaa he, haalanki acchhee baat yah he ki centre main usee kii party kii sarkaar he
 The government may be ready for the reduction in tax collection due to the decline in the consumption of petrol diesel, but now its effect can also be seen on the business of petrol pumps and Delhi, which is awake round the clock, may have to change its other habits
 Huh
 padosi rajya chhattisgarh main congress adhyaksh kii niyukti ke baad madhya pradesh main bhi nae adhyaksh kii sugabugahat he
 The party is looking for a common leader here who can coordinate between all the factions
 party yuva varg se jude adivasee or pichhadaa varg ke netaaon main sambhaavnaaen talash rahi he
 Congress sources say that tribal leader Mohan Markam has been made the state president of the party in the nearby state of Chhattisgarh, and now the party is also looking for a tribal or backward class leader in Madhya Pradesh
 darasal, rajya ke in do virgo ne vidhansabha chunaav main congress kaa saath diya tha
 But in the assembly constituencies where Congress got an edge in the Lok Sabha elections, most of the tribal seats are reserved for the reserved seats
 rajya vidhansabha chunaav main safalataa ke baad pradesh adhyaksh kamalnath ne mukhyamantri pad kii kursi sanbhali or uske baad unhone adhyaksh pad se istipha dene kii peshkash kii thi, magar party adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne unhen loksabhaa chunaav tak is jimmedaari par bane rahane ko kaha tha
 In the Lok Sabha elections, Congress got only one out of 29 seats in Madhya Pradesh
 desh main bhi isi tarah ke nattejey congress ke hisse aae
 Kamleshwar Patel, a minister in the state government, is holding all ministers and leaders responsible for the Congress defeat
 vahiin ek anya mantri umang sighar rajya main aisa adhyaksh chaahate hai, jo sabhi ko saath lekar chale
 However, among the potential faces of the new president in the state Congress, the names of Bala Bachchan and Umang Sighar among the tribal leaders are discussed, on the other hand Kamleshwar Patel and former state president Arun Yadav are being considered in the race
 ye chaaron aise netaa hai, jinka party ke anya netaaon se sidhe taur par koi matbhed nahin he or duusari pankti ke netaa hai
 Therefore, they will not have much problem in coordinating with the party's veteran leaders Chief Minister Kamal Nath, former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh and former Union Minister Jyotiraditya Sidhiya, the party believes
 raajnneetik vishleshak soji thomas kaa kahana he ki "loksabhaa chunaav main haar ke baad se kaaryakartaaon main niraashaa he, yahi kaaran he ki party ek urjavan yuva netaa ko adhyaksh pad kii kaman saunpane par vichaar kar rahi he
 In this, attention is also being paid to the ethnic mathematics of the state
 lihaaja party adivasee athwa pichhadaa varg ke kisi netaa ko adhyaksh banane par vichaar kar sakati he
 "in the state assembly elections held about six months ago, Congress won 114 out of 230 seats, BJP on 109, BSP on two and SP on one
 vahiin chaar sthanon par nirdaleey ummidavaar jite the
 At present, the Congress government is running with the support of SP, BSP and Independent mlas

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday fired a cap bomb at Gujarat, which was created by Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi giving speeches in Delhi and Kolkata
 nitish ne chun-chunakar modi par nishaanaa saadhaa or modi ke har hawaii kile ko dhwast kar diya
 Not only this, Nitish attacked fiercely about Modi's aspirations regarding pm's candidature

 JDU deferment to BJP, but Modi's' na'bihar Chief Minister targeted Narendra Modi on the pretext of the controversy, saying that the country needs a PM who can take everyone along
 iske liye use topi bhi pahananaa padegaa or tilak bhi lagaana padegaa
 Nitish praised Atal Bihari Vajpayee and gave much preference to his Rajdharma statement
 unhone kaha, 'desh ko chalaane ke liye atal bihari vaajapeyi jaisi soch chahie, atal ji rajdharm paalan karne kii baat karte the
 Nitish lashed out at Modi, but in response to the gestures, Bihar BJP leader Giriraj Singh said that we do not need anyone's certificate on secularism
 ham pehle bhi dharmanirpeksh the or bhavishya main bhi rahenge
 He said that it is necessary to work for Muslims, not Muslim hats
 modi topi pahane bina hi muslimon ke liye vikaas ke kaam kar rahe hai
 It is worth mentioning that at the national meeting of Janata Dal (united) on Sunday, a proposal was brought that BJP should declare PM candidate by the end of this year
 lekin jediu adhyaksh sharad yadav ne siddhanton ke saath samjhauta na karne kii baat kahkar apana rukh saaf kar daalaa ki philhal jadyu ko narendra modi manjuur nahin hai
 But it is certain that in the coming days, the echo of this hat bomb of Nitish Kumar is going to be heard

 ' Along with the cold, festivals have also knocked
 tyoharon ke samay har koi sabase zyada khubasurat dikhnaa chahta he
 But cold weather starts in Skinsandrai
 aise main tyohaar ke samay aapaki khubsuurati main kami aa sakati he
 But you do not have to be upset
 ham aapako kuch khaas tips bataa rahe hai, jinhen tri karne se aapaki skin bilkul komal or khubasurat dikhne lagegi
 Make your skin beautiful during festivals - 1
 pani pien-roshni ke pratik tyoharadivaliper aap bhi agar apni khubsuurati se logon kii ankhon main chamak bharna chaahati hai to zyada se zyada pani pien
 Drinking plenty of water removes the toxins present in the body and makes your skin glow
 2
 Moisturizer- Everyone knows that as soon as the onset of cold, the skin starts losing moisture and the skin starts becoming dry and lifeless
 aapaki bejaan skin aapke tyoharon kaa majaa kam kar sakati he
 Therefore, to get rid of it, do apply a moisturizer on your skin daily
 saath hi baar-baar apane chehre ko wash karne se bachein kyonki aisa karne se skin dry hone lagati he
 3
 thanda pani istemaal karen-sardi ke mausam main thanda pani istemaal karnaa sunne main ajeeb lag rahaa hoga
 But tell us that the use of hot water removes the essential oil on the skin and the skin becomes dry
 4
 Reduce makeup - Most women use excess makeup to look different during festivals
 chehre par zyada mechap lagane se chehre kii chamak kam hone lagati he
 Therefore, the more natural you keep your look, the more people will feel isolated and attracted
 5
 Use Sunscreen - Many people think that sunscreen is used only in hot weather
 agar aap bhi unheen logon main se ek hai to aap galat he
 Yes, because sunscreen protects the skin from summer sun as well as winter sun
 isliye sardi ke mausam main bhi ghar se baahar nikalne se pehle sanscreen kaa istemaal jarur karen

 bhabha atomic research centre ke irradiation kendron par gujarat samet kai rajyon se aam kii taaja paidaavaar kaa pahunchnaa shuru ho gaya he
 To export mangoes from India to America and Australia it is necessary to pass mangoes from these centers
 in irradiation kend par pareekshan ke baad hi ye aam videshon main khaane laayak hote hai
 But this year, where it was being speculated that mango exports to the US would be increased by 40%, the arrival of mangoes in the important mango mandis of the country during the last one week is now speculated
 Is turning
 is saal desh main aam kii paidaavaar main badi giravat dekhne ko milegi
 This is because the severe heat in Gujarat and Karnataka during December and the storm Ockhi during December caused great damage to mango trees
 iske baad uttar bharat ke mausam main ho rahe badlaav se uttar pradesh main aam kii paidaavaar par sawaal khadaa ho rahaa he
 Mango yields will remain halfway in Gujarat? An initial survey by the Gujarat government has revealed that the storms in Junagadh and geer-somnath areas of the state were first seen during December and then during march-april due to the heat of mango crop
 The weather has been bad
 is pratikul mausam ke chalate gujarat main aam kii paidaavaar lagbhag lagbhag aadhi rahane kii ummid he
 At the same time, this is the largest assessment of the loss of mango yield in recent years
 iske chalate aam kaarobaariyon ko dar he ki is saal america export hone vaale aam main bhi badi giravat dekhne ko milegi
 Read this: Trade war: China can prepare for the third world war, this attack on America also
 Union Agriculture Minister Purshottam Rupala has also said that now the Gujarat government is suffering from the loss of mango and its access to farmers
 Is assessing loss
 gujarat sarkaar ke ek shuruaati survey ke mutabik kharaab mausam ke chalate samooche saurashtra ilaake main aam kii paidaavaar 40-45 fisadi giravat dekhne ko milegi
 On the basis of this survey, the Agriculture Minister of Gujarat Government has assumed that due to inclement weather, the yield of mangoes will be reduced by 50 to 55 percent in Junagadh area and 55 to 60 percent in Gir Somnath district
 gauratlab he ki gujarat desh main paanchvaan sabase bada aam utpaadak rajya he
 Among the mango producing states at the top are Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana besides Uttar Pradesh
 gujarat kaa junagarh or gir somnath kesar aam ke liye prasiddh he
 This year, while Junagadh has about 8,500 hectares of mango orchards, Gir Somnath has 15,500 hectares of mango orchards
 dakshin gujarat ke valsad, navsari or surat jile main alphonso aam prasiddh he
 Apart from these two mango varieties, Dussehra mango of Uttar Pradesh is important among the mangoes sent from India to America
 telugana main mausam kii bhent chadha dilli kaa pehla aamdesh kii rajdhani dilli main sabase pehle taaja aam pahunchane ke liye vikhyath telugana kaa khammam jila is baar mausam kii maar jhel chukaa he
 There are about 43,000 acres of mango orchards in this district of Telangana
 pichley saal desh kii rajdhani dilli or america main sabase pehle aam pahunchane vaale is jile ne record tod utpaadan karte hue lagbhag lagbhag 70,000 ton aam kaa kaarobaar kiya tha
 In this district of Telangana, Penuballi, Vemasoor and Satupalli mandals are very important for the arrival of mangoes
 ise padhein: china se vyapaar ghaataa america or bharat ko ek saath laa rahaa he?is saal march april ke dauraan kharaab mausam or tej hawa ke saath hui be-mausam barish ke chalate khammam main aam ke baagon ko bada nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 In this unseasonal rain, more than half of the mangoes on the trees fell and farmers have been asked to remove their costs this year
 iske saath hi pichhali baar record aavak ke saath rajdhani dilli tak sabase pehle aam pahunchane vaale is jile ne aam ke premiyon ko niraash kar diya he
 Flavored Banganapalli flavor Mango variety of Banganapalli coming from Andhra Pradesh is known for its taste in the country and the world
 aam ke sijan main yah aam bhi bazaar main pehle aane vaali kismon main shumaar he
 But this year this Banganapalli mango has also disappointed people
 andhrapradesh ke krishi vibhaag ke mutabik bemausam barish ne is saal pedo par laden aam ko samay se pehle gira diya
 Due to this, the arrival of Banganapalli has also reduced to half in the market
 is aam kii pehali aavak bazaar main shuru ho chuki he lekin adhik maang or kam supplai ke chalate banganapalli kii keemat aasmaan chhu rahi he
 According to the statistics of the Department of Agriculture, where the arrival of this mango is generally 16 to 18 lakh tons, this time due to bad weather, only 8 to 10 lakh tons of mango will reach the market
 gauratlab he ki is aam kii uttar bharat main badi maang ke saath-saath america or australia main bhi badi maang rahati he
 At the same time, some businessmen also claim that the weather has affected the taste of mango trees this year
 uttar pradesh ke dashahari par mandara rahaa khatra?beete ek hafte se uttar bharat main mausam saamaanya nahin he
 Last week, a severe storm in several areas of Uttar Pradesh has damaged the Dussehra mangoes of Malihabad
 vahiin mausam vibhaag kaa maananaa he ki agle kuch din pre-monsoon disterbence ke lihaaj se ahm he or uttar pradesh samet kai rajyon main tej hawaaen or aandhi aane kii sambhaavna he
 It is worth noting that at this time the special Dussehra of Uttar Pradesh is loaded on mango trees
 vahiin, mausam vibhaag kii chetavanee or mausam ke badalte mizaaj ko dekhte hue kisaanon ko pedo par laden aamon ke tuutane kaa dar he
 Although the state government has not said any threat to the mango arrivals at present, but there is a possibility that the weather may also be affected here

 ira) onsep 4, 2019 at 2:02 am PDT Rehearsal for this play will be started soon
 iske sho ko bharat ke kai shaharon main dikhaane kii taiyaari he
 Let us know that actress Sarika of the past is associated with this play as a producer
 vah ise apane binar nautankisa production ke binar tale produs karengi
 During an interview, Sarika had told that Ira called me and said that she wants me to act in her play
 main acting nahin karnaa chaahati thi isliye iske bajaay maine iskaa nirmaan karne kii peshkash kii
 Significantly, IRA is very much discussed on social media about her personal life

 sansar ko apni urja se jivan dene vaale bhagwaan bhaskar kii mahima aprampar he sansar surya ke tej se hi prakashit he
 According to astrology, the Sun changes the zodiac every month
 is maheene surya mithun raashi main pravesh kar rahe hai
 Sun stays in one zodiac month
 15 june ko surya mithun raashi main pravesh karke 15 july tak vahaan rahenge
 The date on which the Sun enters from one zodiac sign to another is called Surya Sankranti
 aaie jaanate hai surya ke raashi parivartan kaa jyotishiya mahatv ke bare main
 
 
 Significance of Sun's zodiac change- Sun God is entering Gemini on June 15 - Sun's position in this zodiac is considered to be excellent - This time Mars, Mercury and Rahu will also be present along with Sun - and also the sight of Saturn
 Will- This relationship of Saturn with Sun, Mars, Mercury and Rahu
 
 
 - rajnatik or samjik rup se samasyaayein de saktaa he- vipareet swabhaav ke grahon kaa sambandh vicitra parinaam paidaa karegamithun raashi main surya kaa prabhaav- swasthya par dhyaan den- krodh karke rishton ko na bigaaden- ravivaar ke din gud or genhu kaa daan karenjyotishi kehete hai ki agar aapaki raashi par
 If the effect of Sun's zodiac change is bad, then by taking small measures, you can remove those bad effects, but what effect can the transit of the Sun have on the remaining zodiac signs? The effect of the planets in the solar system on our lives can be understood by those who have ever felt these changes
 'yakeen maniye, jis nakshatra main ham janm lete hai, us samay maujuud grah saare jivan hamen prabhavit karte hai
 Now these effects can be positive as well as negative
 jyotishi kehete hai ki surya grahon ke raja hai or sabhi grah inase prabhavit hote hai
 Therefore, the zodiac sign of the Sun has an effect on all the planets and zodiac signs
 aai jaanate hai surya ke mithun raashi main pravesh karne se aapaki raashi par kya asar padegaa
 If your zodiac sign is Cancer - problem in married life and business - Do not take any kind of care - Stop fasting on Sunday, wear copper, if your zodiac is lion - Possibility of economic benefit - Honor will be respected - Chant Gayatri Mantra regularly
 If your zodiac sign is Virgo - take care of your spouse's health - there are changes in job placement - do not be angry, offer water to the sun, it is not like the sun's zodiac sign The bad effects of dalas cannot be avoided
 kuch upayon or puja aradhana se bure prabhaavon ko kam kiya ja saktaa he

 Communist Party of India (CPI) candidate Kanhaiya Kumar, who contested from Begusarai Lok Sabha seat in Bihar, is also adopting the same method of contesting elections
 lekin usamen ek nayaapan bhi dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 He is resorting to crowdfunding for election funding
 party kaa bhi maananaa he ki raajnneeti main nae log aaen or sansadeey siyasat main jamaane ke mutabik party ko lekar aage badhen
 Left parties have so far avoided contesting elections in a capitalist manner
 ye partiyaan jan bhagidaari se chunaav ladane ko tardih detii hai
 But Kanhaiya Kumar is following a new path and is on the lines of the electoral methods of other parties called bourgeois
 lekin kanhaiya kumaar ke croudfnding ko lekar soshal media main sawaal uth rahe hai
 Questioners say whether Kanhaiya Kumar is above the party who is crowdfunding for himself
 is sawaal par sipiai se jude mahesh rathi kehete hai ki party ne unhen isaki anumati de rakhi he
 He says that the problem is that even if the left parties fight elections in the old way, it is said that these parties are not fit in the new age and are not going according to the new technology and even if the parties of the left take a new path They are targeted
 yah tark nyaaysangat nahin he
 Mahesh Rathi aajtak
 in se baatcheet main bataaya, ‘sipiai ab tak party kaaryakartaaon, trade union, janata or apane sanghathanon ke dwaara jutaaye gaye chande se chunaav ladati rahi he
 But like BJP, Congress and other parties, Kanhaiya Kumar, former president of Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union, is resorting to crowdfunding
 isamen dikkat kya he?’ unhone kaha ki chanda to janata se hi liya ja rahaa he, bas fark itnaa hi he ki chanda lene kaa salika badal gaya he or online madhyam kaa sahaara liya ja rahaa he
 Raza Haider, who is associated with Kanhaiya Kumar's election team, also agrees with Mahesh Rathi's opinion
 unhone kaha, ’pehle ham ghar-ghar jaakar logon se chanda lete the to kisi ko pataa nahin chalata tha
 But now technology is using online platform for political donations
 isamen kya buraai ho sakati he?’ is sawaal par ki yah to poonjivadi tarika he, raja haidar kehete hai ki, ‘kuch puraane left ke train hai jinhen nayaa tarika raas nahin aa rahaa he
 Technology is the absolute medium, all of whom take help, we are also taking help
 ’vahiin bataaya ja rahaa he ki kanhaiya kumaar ne croudfnding kii online platfarm ourdemocracy ke jariye teen dinon main 30 lakh rupee ekatrit kar liye hai, lekin is website ko hack kar liya gaya he
 On the website being hacked, Kanhaiya Kumar tweeted, 'those who raise the voice of the exploited and deprived are harassed on the ground, they have to face conspiracies even on the internet
 lekin ham na sibar atake se darate hai na kisi or atake se
 The website with the donation will be in front of you very soon
 saazishen haarengi, hamaari ekta jeetegi

 a UK court has been told that 29-year-old Indian-origin person Jasveer Ram Ginde strangled his wife Barkha Rani to death and burnt her body just a few months after their marriage, for allegedly concealing their homosexuality
 wolverhampton crown adaalat ko bataaya gaya ki jasvir ne midlands ke walsol sthit apane ghar main barkhaa par dhaatu kii ek pipe se hamalaa kiya
 He burnt Barkha's corpse in a garden furnace but told one of his neighbors that he had set the garbage and waste on fire
 adaalat ko bataaya gaya ki barkhaa or jasvir kii shaadi pichley saal march maheene main hui thi
 After getting a visa in August, Barkha came to the UK to live with her husband
 abhiyojak debora gould ke mutabik jasvir ne apane ek dost ko bataaya tha ki saal 2008 ke samay se hi vah purushon ke prati aakarshith rahata tha
 According to Deborah, about a month before Barkha's death on September 12 last year, someone in her house gathered information about the furnaces on the Internet

 Former Army Chief VK Singh, who was associated with Anna's movement and recently shared the stage with bjp's PM candidate, Narendra Modi, may come under scrutiny
 sena ne unke khilaaf kai gambhir maamalon main raksha mantralay se jaanch kii sifarish kii he
 The list of allegations against VK Singh is quite long
 un par jammu-kashmir kii umr abdulla sarkaar ko asthir karne ke liye sikret sarvice fund kaa durupyog karne, raksha mantralay ke senior adhikariyon kii avaidh tareeke se phone tepe karne, vittiya gadabadiyaan karne jaise gambhir aarope hai
 It is believed that the Ministry of Defense may get the CBI to investigate these allegations against VK Singh
 agar aisa hua, to purv general ke liye badi museebataan khadi ho sakati hai
 According to the information, the Ministry of Defense can submit its report in this regard to the PMO
 iske baad kuch thos kadam uthaae ja sakate hai
 The Army has requested the Ministry of Defense to order a high-level inquiry into the functioning of the 'secret Intelligence Unit' set up by General VK Singh
 sena ko shaq he ki is unit ne ‘gaiyrkanoonee kaam’ or vittiya gadabadiyaan kin
 According to sources, the Army's report regarding the Department of Technical Assistance accused of illegally tapping phones of senior officials of the Ministry of Defense has recently been submitted to the Ministry of Defense
 report main is unit ke kaamkaaj kii jaanch kii sifarish kii gai he
 In this regard, the army headquarters has said that the matter is closed from their side
 sena mukhyalay ne is bare main or tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya
 According to sources, the army does not want to investigate against this unit on its part
 sena nahin chaahati he ki vah apane purv general ke khilaaf karrwai kare, kyonki yah sena kii saakh se judaa maamla he
 But what turns this matter forward, it is too early to say
 yah report general bikram singh dwaara is top sikret unit ke kaamkaaj kii samiksha ke liye gathit adhikari board (bioo) kii ore se sainya abhiyaan ke mahanideshak leftinent general vinod bhaatia ne taiyaar kii
 On VK Singh's explanation, General VK Singh said that this is clearly a quarrel, because some people are not comfortable with him sharing the stage with Narendra Modi for the interests of ex-servicemen of the country
 wike singh ne kaha ki agar kisi ne is unit ke kriyakalapon kii jaanch kii sifarish kii he, to vah ekadam gairajaruri kaam kar rahaa he, kyonki yah abhiyaan gupt rakhane ke liye tha
 However, it remains to be seen how successful VK Singh, who has drawn the attention of the entire country towards many types of irregularities in the army, is able to wash the stains on him

 Since he had voted for her and the party had got a majority, he could not understand why she was not assuming the position as party president
 ’sonia or shriver kii baithak ko sauhardpurn qaraar dete hue cabel main kaha gaya he ki sonia khulkar baatcheet karne lageen or apane bare main unhone kuch aisi baaten bataayin jo bahut kam logon ko maaloom he
 The cable said, "sonia, who is generally serious and reserved in public, had a long conversation and talked about some aspects of her personal life as well as issues related to women
 ’cabel ke mutabik, bhaajapa ke udai evam dakshin panthi raajnneeti ke kaaran unhen na chaahate hue bhi raajnneeti main aane ko majaboor hona padaa
 In the cable released by wikileaks, 'about the personal political stance, Mrs Gandhi said that the South Panth was becoming stronger in India and the Congress weaker, so she was forced to step into politics to preserve the legacy of the Gandhi family
 ’cabel main kaha gaya he ki unhone yah khulaasa bhi kiya ki unke bachche is vichaar se bahut zyada ittefaq nahin rakhte the lekin aakhirkaar bacchon ne kaha, ‘aap jo bhi faisla karengi ham aapkaa saath denge
 Sonia said that her parents had objected to her marriage to Rajiv Gandhi but she stuck to her stand and eventually married him
 congress adhyaksh ne yah bhi kaha ki vah mahasoos karti hai unke raajnneetik jivan main unka mahila hona kabhi bhi mudda nahin rahaa he or indira gandhi kaa bhi yahi maananaa tha
 According to the cable, while discussing Shrivara on population control, Sonia says that 'population control' is a political taboo (tabu) in India after Indira Gandhi was ousted from power on this issue

 But past experience has forced the UPA to focus on raising awareness and providing basic health services and methods that can automatically curb birth rates
 shriver se baatcheet main sonia apni nijee jindagi ke pahaluon ke bare main kahati hai ki vah aksar bharat main yatraaen karti rahati hai, aam aadmi se sampark ke liye praaia: sudur ilaakon kii bhi yatra karti hai kyonki baahar jaakar or logon se miljul kar hi unki samasyaayein or aakankshaayen behatar tareeke se samajhi ja sakati hai
 While discussing indo-american relations, Sonia jokingly says that the 'indian Left is anti-american', but agrees that her attitude is towards American policy rather than American

 According to Tiwari, "they need to divert attention from their internal battles
" isliye ve puraane aarope laga rahe hai jinka purv main dridhta se jawaab diya ja chukaa he
 He said that the issues raised by BJP today have already been answered
 tiwari ne kaha, ‘aaj uthaae gaye muddon main se har ek kaa nirnaayak or dridhta se jawaab diya ja chukaa he
 So it is their turn today
 apane adhyaksh ke khilaaf vibhinn muddon par bhartiya janata party ko safai deni he
 Manish Tiwari said that the issues related to Gadkari were not made public by the Congress and the government, but by independent media organizations
 tiwari bole, ‘isliye dhyaan bhatakaane ke prayaas kii bajaae, apni rihaai khud karne ke bajaae, apana abhiyojak or nyaayadhish khud hone ke bajaae, bhartiya janata party ke liye yah behatar hoga ki vah swatantra media sanghathanon dwaara unke adhyaksh ke lenden par uthaae gaye muddon kaa jawaab de
 He also asked if the government was ready to split the vote in Parliament on the question of allowing foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail
 unhone kaha, ‘jab jarurat hogi tab hamen sankhya kii kami nahin hogi
 The Parliament session has not started yet and the House leaders are yet to meet
 donon sadanon ke peethasin adhikariyon ko apni bhoomika nibhaani he , isliye ise chhod diya jaae

 The main theme of the conference was 'hindi world and Indian culture' and the objective was 'to increase the reach of Hindi language globally'
 bhartiya duutavas, denmark ne mujhe is sammelan main denmark ke pratinidhi ke rup main bhej kar yah sunaharaa avasar diya, jiske liye main duutavas kii atyant abhaari hoon

 teen divasiy sammelan ke dauraan 'hindi vishwa or bhartiya samskruti' par aath up-vishyon par vichaar-vimarsh hua
 The status of Hindi was discussed in various dimensions
 18 agast or 19 agast ko chaar-chaar vibhinn vishyon par teen-teen ghante ke samanaantar satr chale
 The participants chose the sessions from their respective interests
 sabhi satr samanaantar chal rahen the, so sabhi main bhaag lenaa sambhav nahin tha
 i attended the session of 'development of Indian Languages including Hindi through Technology' on 18 August, which was chaired by Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju
 sah adhyaksh ashok chakradhar the
 On 19 August, i participated in 'pravasi Sansar: Language and Culture', chaired by Dr
 Kamal Kishore Goenka and co-chairman Mr
 Gulshan Sukhlal
 18 agast ko raatri bhojan uparant apane hotel main sushamaa swaraj videsh se aaye chalis pratinidhiyon se vyaktigat taur par milin
 In the two-and-a-half-hour session, all the delegates, one by one, told them what role they were playing in the promotion and propagation of Hindi in their respective countries
 sushamaa swaraj ne sabhi ko bade dhairya or dilchaspee se suna
 It was interesting to hear Hindi, our national language fluent in the face of foreigners like Chinese, Japanese, Indonesian, Germany, Italian, Hungarian, Fiji etc
 yah ek vilakshan anubhav tha
 The knowledgeable about his works was pleasantly surprised
 koi hindi kaa nayaa paathyakram bana rahaa he, to koi hindi vyakaran kii nai kitaab likh rahaa he to koi hindi kaa nayaa shabdkosh taiyaar kar rahaa he to koi bhartiya samskruti or darshan failaa rahaa he
 Someone is trying to get Hindi equivalent status of French, German and Spanish languages in the schools of our country
 mudde jo uthesushamaa swaraj ne apane udghaatan bhaashan main kaha ki hindi ko badhaane kii jimmedaari bharat kii he, or jahaan tak hindi ko sanyukt raashtra sangh kii aadhikarik bhashaa banane kaa he, usamen mukhya samasya yah he ki samarthak deshon ke sambandhit vyay vahan karnaa hoga
 If only India had to bear the expenditure, we would have achieved it by paying 400 crores
 unhone ummid jataai ki jab yoga diwas ke liye bharat 177 deshon kaa samarthan hasil kar saktaa he to sayukt raashtra kii bhashaa ke liye 129 deshon kaa samarthan bhi vah hasil kar legaa
 By the way, it is a matter of pride for all of us Indians that the United Nations has created an account in Hindi on its Twitter and weekly news in Hindi language has started circulating
 swaraj ne sammelan logo par bani anemation film kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki bharat kaa mor aayega or dodo ko bachaayegaa
 It is shown in this film that when the national bird of Mauritius starts drowning, the national bird of India comes to the peacock and saves it, then both dance
 bahuton ko bhartiya mayur or dodo pakshi kii yah anemeshan clip bachakaani lagi
 In the session of 'development of Indian languages including Hindi through technology', there was a strong discussion to make Hindi and other languages of India hi-tech
 grih rajyamantri kiren rigiju ne kaha ki nai peedi ke liye bhashaa kaa digital vikaas hona anivaary he
 Technology is highly important for the next generation
 i-shikshan, i-paathshaalaayein aaj samay kii maang hai
 Master of Software Balendu Dadhich gave an impressive presentation of the languages' digitalisation of languages
 'pravasi sansar : bhashaa or samskruti' satr ke dauraan mahatma gandhi santhaan ke adhyaksh gulshan sukhlal ne kaha ve ek moracian hai, unhen girmitiyaa na kaha jaae or na hi morishas main likhe hindi sahitya ko pravasi sahitya kaha jaae
 Hindi literature written in Mauritius is similar to this, literature written by residents of Australia, New Zealand, USA, England is called English literature, this class of literature is not there
 sukhlal ne sammelan ke logo par bhi aapatti jataate hue kaha ki sammelan morishas main ho rahaa he or sammelan kaa logo tay karne ke liye unki raay nahin lee gai
 Dodo has been extinct more than three hundred years, what does this logo mean
 magar main yahan par yah kahana chaahuungi ki morishas dweep vilupt ho chuke dodo pakshi ke antim or ekmaatr ghar ke rup main bhi vikhyath he, so videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj kii vyakhya nirarthak nahin thi
 Issues that did not arise Many issues did not arise in the conference
 bahut adhik bheed thi, lagbhag do hajaar hindi vidwaan or premi the
 It was impossible for everyone to have the opportunity to speak, yet some of the speakers went to the stage making rubbish rubbish, the abstract thoughts of some remained on their lips
 baharhaal tathy yah he ki morishas main hindi bolne waalon kii sankhya nirantar ghat rahi he
 Mauritius Prime Minister Pravin Kumar Jagannath himself could not speak Hindi
 haalanki meri kai sthaneey logon se mulaakaat hui jo hindi bolte hai, magar sarkari aankade bataate hai morishas main hindi bolne waalon kii sankhya nirantar ghat rahi he, or aaj yah vahaan kii anya kshetreey bhashaaon kii ksheni main aa gai he
 According to a news from The Times of India, enrollment of students in English-medium schools in India, especially in Hindi-speaking states, has doubled in the last five years
 agar yahi hisaab rahaa to 2050 tak angreji madhyam skulon main chaatro kaa namakan badhkar 70 fisadi tak ho jayega
 English will flourish in the country
 sahityakar harajendra choudhary ne is sandarbh main kaha ki bhashaa bhavukta nahin, yatharth he
 Unless a language becomes a language of employment, people will not adopt it
 agar yah maan liya jaae ki angreji, francisi, spanish bhashaaen apane aupniveshik shashan kii vajah se vibhinn deshon main chai he, magar mandarin, japani or arabi bhashaaen to apni samskruti ke dam par aage badi hai
 Despite being a language of such a large nation and community, Hindi with grammatical consensus, a unique script and a large dictionary could not gain the importance that other languages readily found on the global level
 iske liye ham sabhi doshi hai
 i asked 20-25 participants from India about the medium in which schools their children attended
 sabhi kaa jawaab tha - angrejimadhyam main
 Schools in Hindi medium have children who cannot afford English medium schools or in remote rural areas where they do not have English medium schools
 dekha jaae ki aaj hamaari raashtra bhashaa kaa asli daaromadar garibon ke kandhon par he
 Bollywood films and our scriptures, poets have given some importance to Hindi, otherwise Hindi is getting destroyed
 jaden to khokhli ho rahi hai or ham upar hi upar dekh rahen hai
 Many government schools have also decided to adopt the English medium to save their existence
 sammelan kii vyavasthisamen koi shaq nahin ki sammelan kii vyavastha sanbhaalane vaale aayojak or kaaryakarta din-raat tan-man se jute the, par aisa mahasoos hua ki morishas itani badi taadaad main pratibhaagiyon kaa prabandh karne main sakasham nahin tha
 There was a shortage of manpower
 sabase adhik gadabad sammelan main hissaa lene vaale logon ke panjikaran main hui
 Many people could not get their registration online due to technical glitch, which caused them trouble
 resepshan counter par baithe aayojakon ko maaloom hi nahin tha ki kinhen pratinidhi sadsy, vishesh aamantrit yaa phir saadhaaran pratibhaagi kii shrenee main rakhana he
 According to their respective registration status, all the orange, green, yellow and blue color badges were distributed
 baij ke rang ke nirdhaaran kaa maandand samaj main nahin aayaa, kyonki kai pratibhaagi jo ek jaisi prashthabhumi ke the, ek jaisi haisiyat rakhte the, unhen alag alag rang ke baij mili
 Some government representatives from different countries also received badges of different colors
 panjikaran karne vaale logon ke paas iskaa koi jawaab nahin tha
 Well, badges were not allowed to be present at the event without hanging around the neck, and according to the color of the badge a seating area in the hall and food was allowed to enter the pandal
 naarangi baijadhari (pratinidhi sadsy), haul kii agrim siton par virajman, phir hare baij vaale (vishesh aamantrit), phir sabase ant main nile baijadhari (saamaanya pratibhaagi), jinaki sankhya sabase adhik thi
 There were two pandals of tea-water and food
 naarangi baijadhari behatar pandal par, jahaan bheed kam, vyavastha acchhee
 The entry of green and blue badges was prohibited in this pandal
 duusare pandal, jo hare or nile baijadhari, yani saamaanya pratibhaagiyon ke liye tha, main jo khaane ke liye lambi qatari, bheed-bhadkaa rahati thi, kai baar pratibhaagiyon ne ek pyaali thandi chaay ke liye lambi qatari main laganaa munasib nahin samajha
 He remained without tea and water
 pichley bees varshon se denmark main rahane kii vajah se mujhe is tarah kaa bhedbhaav akhar gaya
 Here, at any stage, at least the food and drink system remains the same for everyone, even if ten pandals have to be planted
 chaahe raja ho yaa rank, koi bhedbhaav nahin
 One can go and eat anywhere
 sammelan kii mansammelan ke antim din, somvaar, 20 agast ko samaapan samaaroh main bharat or morishas ke kai mantriyon kii bhagidaari rahi
 Eight recommendations for the spread of Hindi were presented during the conference
 morishas ke kaaryvahak raashtrapati paramashivam pillai vyapuri ne kaha he ki hindi vishwa shanti ko sudrudh banaaegi
 The award recipients were mostly from foreign and non-hindi speaking states of India
 hindi unki maatrubhaasha na hote hue bhi unhone hindi ko gale lagaaya he, sambhavtah isko dhyaan main rakh kar unhen sammaan diya gaya
 Well, one awardee from Fiji - Nemani Adivasai became so emotional that when he got the award, he sat on the feet of the tall man Sushma Swaraj
 unka kahana tha ki fiji sammaan kii apni pratha paalan karne ke liye neeche baithe
 i too was strongly influenced by Sushma Swaraj's personality
 unka hindi bhashaa par adhikaar, unki bhaashan dene kii kala itani adhik prabhaavshaalee he ki jitani bhi prashansa kii jaae kam he
 It is my good fortune that i got an opportunity to interact with a student like Sushma Swaraj

 Vijaya Sati, Padhari from India, etc

 sammelan main meri mulaaqaat kai aise logon se bhi hui jinka hindi se koi matlab nahin tha
 It seems that he has come to Mauritius with his family and friends in a literary picnic
 bharat main bahut saare tour group nirmit ho gayi hai jo logon ko ikattha kar duniya kii saiyr karavaate hai
 Not everyone was free to attend the conference
 kai log acha-khaasaa dhan vyay karke, apane kharche se sammelan main hissaa lene aae
 Apart from incurring the expenses of air tickets, hotels, etc
, he also paid a registration fee of five thousand rupees in the conference
 khayr is sandarbh main meraa maananaa he ki hamen sirf hindi vidwaanon or saahitiyik halkon ke mahaarathiyon ko hi sammelan main ekatra nahin karnaa he
 Attendance of ordinary citizens in these conferences is very mandatory
 agar yah sammelan unhen hindi ke prati kuch prerit kar paaya to sammelan kii asli kamyaabi yahi he
 The Voila Hotel in Mauritius had several conference attendees, including Dr
 Peter Shagi from Hungary and Dr
 Hines Warner from Sweden
 dow peter shaagi ne latin-unani-sanskrit kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya, kendriya hindi santhaan, agra se piechdi kii, or budapest vishvavidhyalay main hindi padhaane ja rahe hai

 'koi Virani Si Virani Haidasht Ke Aadh Mein Aadhaar Mein Kya Hai' These lines of Galib are telling the reality of the bad condition of his house and mausoleum today
 urdu ke mahaan shaayar mirza gaalib ne puraani dilli ke shahjahanabad ke ballimaran main 15 farvari 1869 ko apni haveli main antim saansen leen or unhen chausath khamba ke paas hazrat nizamuddin dargah ke najadik hi dafnaaya gaya
 a hundred years after Ghalib's death, no construction work was done to maintain the identity of his tomb, until a highly admired Englishman came to Delhi from across the seven seas searching for his tomb
 gaalib kii kabr kaa koi pataa na paakar usne akhbaar main isse sambandhit ek lekh likhaa
 It was then known that since Ghalib's death, there was no place marked as his sign
 iske baad film abhinayta shoharaab modi va hamdard ke hakim abdul hamid ke prayaason se gaalib kii kabr par ek sundar makbare kaa nirmaan takseem ho paaya
 Today, like other heritage sites in India, Ghalib's tomb is under the supervision of the Archaeological Department of India, but its condition is in very poor condition
 makbare ke praveshdwar kii chaabiyaan suraksha gardon ko saunp di gai hai or yaheen se darshakon kii asli pareshaani shuru hoti he
 When about 10 people asked the guard about the key, that old man named Tauqir called, 'babu Bhai
 
 ! ' But nobody came
 phir usne chaabi ko mag, gandagi se kaale ho chuke ek chaate tathaa mitti ke toote hue bartanon ke bich khojna shuru kiya
 And finally the key was found inside the umbrella
 gaalib kii haveli kii haalat bhi kuch khaas behatar nahin he
 Spread over 130 square yards, this mansion is lying in a dilapidated condition
 yahaan na roshni he na koi jindagi
 Despite repeated requests from the Delhi government, nothing has been done to improve and beautify the condition of this building in the memory of the great poet of the city
 taumr pareshaani jhelane vaale gaalib kaa ant bhi utana hi kshtmay rahaa
 He had to wash his hands with everything he loved
 jab bachapan main the, tab pita allaah ke paas chale gaye or kishor vay ke hue to bade bhai chal based
 None of Ghalib's seven children survived himself
 harkar unhone ek bachche ko god liya lekin jawan hote-hote uski bhi maut ho gai
 These tragedies broke Ghalib deep inside but he did not fight with it, believing it to be the will of Allah
 
 
 gam-e-hasti kaa asad kisase ho juj marg ilajashmma har rang main jalati he sahar hone tak
 It is said that Ghalib was the heir to a large princely state, but he had no qualms about the wealth he had inherited from his ancestors, and he preferred human relationships more than what is reflected in his poetry
 apni shaayari main kabhi vah premi ke taur par, kabhi drashtaa ke taur par to kabhi allaah ke aage jhuke hue bande ke taur par jivan ke vibhinn pahaluon ko rekhaankit karte hai
 There were also many oddities with Ghalib
 gaalib ke nikatwartiyon ke paas unase judi bahut si rochak kahaniyaan hai
 It is said that he spent the whole night playing with a large piece of cloth while drowning in his thoughts in the dim flame of the lamp
 jab vah ghazal ke ashaaron se santusht ho jate to use yaad rakhane ke liye vah kapade main ek ganth laga dete the
 He used to spend the whole night while doing this
 agle din jaagane par vah kapade kii har ganth aahista-aahista kholte jate the or raat main banaai hui panktiyaan unhen yaad hoti jaati thim
 Only Ghalib could do this
 adab kii duniya ke betaj badshaah ko sau-sau salaam
 Here are some lines of Ghalib

 yah jaankaree chini videsh mantralay ne buudhvaar ko di
 Indeed, China has always considered Taiwan to be its own trouble-making province, and according to it Taiwan has no right to have diplomatic relations with other countries
 chini videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa geng shuyang ne kaha, "ham ummid karte hai ki bharat, china kii gahari chintaaon ko samajhakar unka sammaan karegaa, or 'ek china' ke siddhant kaa paalan karegaa, or taiwan-sambandhi muddon se nipatane main saavdhaanee bartegaa, or bharat-china rishton main satat majbootee banaae rakhega

 pakistan ke raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari ke badale apane desh kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahe kuraishi ne shanivaar ko kaha ki pakistan hameshaa bharat ke saath baatcheet karne ko taiyaar he lekin vah baatcheet bina kisi purv shart ke honi chahie
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Wednesday at the conclusion of his US visit that Pakistan was not taking adequate steps to punish the conspirators of the Mumbai attacks
 unhone jor diya tha ki jab tak aisa nahin ho jaataa, tab tak bharat chaiyn nahin legaa
 Singh said that Pakistan should take more steps to punish the culprits
 kuch shadyantrkaari mukt gum rahe hai
 Pakistan should also destroy the terrorist structure which poses a continuing threat against India
 krishna or kuraishi ne pichhali baar sitambar main neuyork main sanyukt raashtra mahasabha ke itar mulaakaat kii thi
 During this time, the Pakistani leader had assured that his country would make every effort to bring the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks to justice
 krishna or kuraishi is maheene kii shuruyaat main afghanistan ke raashtrapati hamid karaji ke shapath grahan samaaroh main bhaag lene ke liye kabul main the
 During the banquet hosted by Afghan Foreign Minister Colored Dafdar Spanta, Krishna asked Qureshi about the progress made in the investigation of the Mumbai attacks and made him aware that the investigation needed to be expedited
 bharat yah mahasoos karata he ki shadyantrkariyon ko dandit karnaa ab bhi dur kaa sapana dikhaai padataa he kyonki pakistan main kanoonee prakriya kii gati dhimi he or isamen takneekee avrodh paidaa hue hai
 Welcoming the decision to file a charge sheet against seven suspects, including lashkar-e-taiba commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, India told Pakistan that it should also send other conspirators of the attacks, including Jamaat ud Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed Efforts should be made to bring justice to justice
 bharat lashkar e taiyaba ke aatankwaadi pakistani mul ke david colman hedli tathaa tahawwur rana kii giraftaar ke silsile main pakistan ke rukh se bhi niraash he
 The two were arrested by the FBI from Chicago last month on charges of plotting major attacks in India
 epabiai se mili jaankaree ke aadhaar par pakistan ne hedli or rana se jude kuch logon ko giraftaar kiya lekin bharat ko is sambandh main pakistan kii ore se aupchaarik taur par kuch bhi nahin bataaya gaya
 Sources underline that Islamabad's attitude is similar despite Pakistan's repeated assurances to cooperate in counter-terrorism directed against India

 Former Chief Ministers like SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, Delhi Congress President Sheila Dixit, Digvijay Singh and Bhupendra Singh are under fire in this phase
 digvijay singhdesh kaa dil kahe jane vaale madhya pradesh kii rajdhani bhopal loksabhaa seat ke chunavi jang par deshbhar kii nigahen lagi hui hai
 From here, Congress veteran and 10 years Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Digvijay Singh is in the field, against whom BJP has made the contest interesting by taking down Sadhvi Pragya Thakur, accused of terrorism case
 bataa den ki digvijay singh 1993 main madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri bane
 After that he remained the Chief Minister till 2003
 2003 main bijepi kii uma bharti siem baniin
 After losing the election, Digvijay Singh decided that he would not contest the election for the next 10 years

 Let us tell you that Sheila Dixit contested the Kannauj seat for the first time in 1984 and won by winning Parliament

 Sheila Dixit became the Chief Minister of Delhi three times in a row and ruled the power here for fifteen years

 Akhilesh Yadav tried his luck in this election and he won in the very first attempt

 Akhilesh also won the election from Firozabad in 2009 but later vacated the seat
 iske baad 2012 main sapa ko purna bahumat mila to mukhyamantri kaa taj akhilesh yadav ke sir sajaa
 Thus, at the age of 38, Akhilesh became the 33rd Chief Minister of UP
 sabase kam umr main mukhyamantri banane kaa record bhi akhilesh ke hi naam he
 In 2017, SP suffered badly in UP

 Why the Purvanchali stakes the BJP by making Manoj Tiwari the president in Delhi, this question is troubling even those who do and understand the politics of Delhi, but as soon as Manoj Tiwari became the president, the answers to this question have also started coming up automatically
 dilli bijepi ne tiwari ke adhyaksh banane ke baad shuukravaar ko pehali baar purvanchal morcha kaa sammelan bulaayaa or ismenmanoj tiwarike staradam kii puri jhalak mili
 The voters of Purvanchal have a significant number of people in Delhi and the BJP is trying its best to woo this vote bank in the upcoming MCD elections, as the Aam Aadmi Party was successful in securing the support of Purvanchalis in the last assembly elections
 isiilie vaisya punjabi ke sameekaran ko aage rakhane vaali bijepi is baar purvaanchali daanv apana rahi he, yahi nahin purvaanchali adhyaksh manoj tiwari apane grih pradesh yani uttar pradesh ke purab ke ilaake main is baar bhi star prachaarak to honge hi vahiin unki dilli bijepi adhyaksh ke taur par nai pahchaan bhi party ke liye phydemand ho sakati he
 However Manoj Tiwari said that he belongs to everyone and everyone belongs to him
 unhone kaha ki dilli bijepi adhyaksh banane ke baad wo koi ek morcha ke netaa nahin hai, balki wo saansad ke taur par unki seat or adhyaksh ke taur par puri dilli ke logon ke sukh-dukh main shaamil hone aae hai
 That is why they have a relationship with Delhi apart from electoral mathematics
 lekin tiwari kaa istemaal bijepi image badalane ke liye bhi karnaa chaahati he
 Because BJP has been seen to be associated with the business class in Delhi as well and the command has been mostly given keeping this equation in mind, now BJP is not only adding East Angle to this equation, but also using Tiwari's stardom
 There is no lag in doing it either
 manoj tiwariadhyaksh banane ke baad dilli kii alag-alag jhuggi bastiyon main raat guzaar rahe hai
 The claim is that by doing this they want to understand the problem of the slum dwellers, but the aim is also to make a place in the heart of the slum dwellers and Purvanchali voters
 purvi dilli ke purv meyar ramnarayan dube kehete hai ki manoj tiwari sidhe logon ke dil main utarate hai, wo netaa ke taur par nahin balki logon se unke jaisaa hi banakar milte hai
 This strategy also shows that in any political event, Manoj Tiwari makes speeches as president, but he knows that people come to know, see and hear him as singer Manoj Tiwari and Bhojpuri star, That is why, by some excuse or other, people fulfill this wish or demand
 purvanchal ke sammelan main tiwari apni aawaaj kaa jaadu bikherne se peeche nahin rahe
 a rape accused from Dimapur Central Jail was first evacuated by an angry mob and then beaten to death
 jaankaree ye bhi he ki kai or kaidi bhi jail se bhaag gaye hai

 duusari taraf nagaland police ne grih mantralay se or force bhi maangi he or army ko bhi alert kar diya gaya he
 According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the incident took place at 4 pm
 ek varisht adhikari ne enditivi ko bataaya, "jail ko sthaneey police or jail gards guard kar rahe the, lekin wo us aaropee ko bachaa nahin sake
 "on the spot, the police said that seeing such a crowd, he could not understand what to do
 us adhikari ke mutabik is ghatana kaa asar kanoon vyavastha par bhi padaa he kyonki police laachaar ban tamaasha dekhati rahi
 "CRPF personnel do not take action unless instructions are given
 " He said, around 600 people attacked Dimapur Central Jail in the afternoon
 jis ladki kaa balaatkaar hua tha wo ek tribal thi
 The crowd was angry
 pehle bheed ne jail par hamalaa kiya
 The accused was dragged about seven kilometers from there and due to which he died
 phir bheed ne use (ab laash ko) sadak ke ek chowk par faansee laga di
 According to the Home Ministry, the impact of this incident will be on the surrounding areas, especially in Assam, hence the alert has been issued

 Most people are aware of type 1 and type 2 diabetes
 lekin shaayad hi kisi ko diabetes tip 3 si ke bare main pataa hoga
 Type 3-C diabetes has been discovered in a recent study
 shodhakartaon kaa maananaa he ki logon main tip 3-si diabetes bhi kaaphi aam hoti he, lekin tip-3 si diabetes ko dow
 Can not recognize
 saath hi unhone yah bhi bataaya ki ab tak 2 million diabetes se peedit logon main keval 3 fisadi logon kii diabetes tip 3-si kaa hi pataa lag paaya he
 According to this study conducted in diabetes specialist centers, type 3 and c diabetes, like insulin, are required by the body with the digestive enzymes
 is adhyayan main england ke royal college of general practisionar research and servillians databes ke lagbhag 2 millian se zyada health ricords ko istemaal kiya gaya
 Researchers have claimed that youth are more likely to have type 3-C than diabetes type 1
 iske saath hi unhone yah bhi bataaya ki tip-2 ke mukaable tip 3-si diabetes main sugar level ko niyantran karnaa zyada mushkil hota he
 In this, the body needs 10 times more insulin
 ye hai diabetes ke 3 tip:diabetes tip 3-si:agar aapane pancriyaaj kii surgery karai ho, aapke pancriyaaj main tumor ho yaa aapke pancriyaaj kaam karnaa band kar den to aapako diabetes 3-si hone kii zyada sambhaavna hoti he
 In this, not only the amount of insulin is reduced, but also the proteins that digest food with hormones are also made in small quantities
 diabetes tip 2:sharir ke thik tarah se insulin kaa prayog nahin kar paane kii vajah se diabetes tip 2 hoti he
 But this diabetes occurs in older people
 diabetes tip 1:yah diabetes pancriyaaj kii beta koshikaayen puri tarah se nasht hone ke kaaran hoti he
 In this, the amount of insulin produced either reduces or stops completely
 is diabetes kaa khatra sabase zyada yuvaaon ko hota he

 The journey from GDP growth to down has seen a steady decline in the 6th quarter
 The thing is that the country's GDP has been falling for 6 consecutive quarters

 Big challenge for the government The latest GDP figures are a big challenge for the Narendra Modi government at the center
 darasal, sarkaar apane 5 saal ke kaarykaal main 5 trillian dollar iconomi ke lakshya par kaam kar rahi he
 Expert believes that to achieve this target, the rate of GDP growth must be more than 8 percent
 haalanki desh ko aarthik susti se nikaalane ke liye beete kuch maheenon main sarkaar ne kai faisle liye hai
 For example, in September, it was announced to reduce the corporate tax from 30 percent to 22 percent
 vahiin nae niveshkon ke liye bhi kai sahuuliyat di gai he
 Similarly, several big announcements have been made by the government to remove the economic slowdown of housing sector, banking sector, auto sector
 lekin in faislon kaa aarthik vikaas dar par kuch khaas asar nahin dikh rahaa
 Small, cheap and safe flight can also be used in many ways besides flying
 jindagi ko sahuuliyat di ja sakati he jaise trephic jam, bharat band, hadtaal, pradarshan, bheed niyantran, trephic diavarjan or control, ashaant rajyon main patharav or hinsak ghatnaon kii nigaraanee, seemaa par gasht, ghuspaithiyon par najar rakhi ja sakati he

 iskaa istemaal desh kii sadakon par rojaanaa ke jam kii chill pon, badhate pradooshan or ghanton sadakon par rengne kii majaburi se nijaat dilaane kaa vikalp ban saktaa he
 These new avatars of small aircrafts and helicopters can become India's military, paramilitary forces and corporate houses owners of the most modern and more natural zeroplane and the common people can use it as consumers
 seemaa par surakshit hawaii gasht, ghuspaithiyon par paini nigahen, ashaant ilaakon main patharbaji yaa tanaav par nigahadaari, haive par trephic niyantran, uttejit bheed ko kaabo karne ke fori upaay, aapadaagrast ilaakon main raahat saamagree giraane, ghayalon ko airlift karne yaa phir tang galiyon vaale ilaakon par najar rakhni ho darkaar chote, sakasham or surakshit vimaanon kii hoti he
 Xeroplane has the option of helicopter features and small aircraft facilities
 zairoplen ke jalwe kii baat karen to ye dedh sau meter ke kachche pakke ranve par bhi daud lagaakar udaan bhar saktaa he
 This plane is capable of flying at low and medium altitudes
 zairoplen ke do chaar or chah savaariyon kii kshamta vaale model hai
 Their price is around two and a half crores
 iske liye eendhan bhi vimaan vaala mahangaa rifind petroleum nahin balki normal petrol he
 Make a tank full of eighty liters of petrol and fly 600 kilometers cool
 vimaanake diziner or france navy ke purv afasar rafel siril ke mutabik is behad halke or chote vimaan kii khaasiyat helicopter or vimaan kii sinerjee he yani helicopter ke adhiktar feechar se yukt naino fibre body se bana ye zairoplen halkaa or majboot he
 Its biggest feature is about safety, that is, the fan on its head rotates at the speed of the wind, not from the engine
 ji haa, bilkul pawan chakki kii tarah
 It gets engine support while starting the engine of the aircraft
 iske baad ye apane aap hawa kii raftaar se ghumta he yani kabhi khuda naa khwasta agar jairoplen ke ingine main koi kharabi bhi aati he or ingine kaam karnaa band yaa kam kar de to upar gum rahe pankhe tab bhi hawa kii raftaar se chalate rahenge
 In such a situation, the aircraft can glide like a glider
 neeche lage pahiye use jatke se girane se bachaate hai or vimaan uchhal-uchhal kar tappe khaataa hua utar jaataa he
 Seeing this, it seems that the country is changing, moving forward and my country is flying
