 Half will say police is like this and half will say that lawyers are like this
 sawaal he system kaa
 How is the system? There is no system in the country
 system banaaiye
 It is perhaps for the first time that a Chief Minister has written out a letter to the country after going out of the purview of the state
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav se kareeb saal bhar pehle apana teen din kaa kaarykram shuru karte hue narendra bhai modi ne desh se kaha he ki ve ekta, sadbhaav or bhaichaare ke liye upwas kar rahe hai
 If you want to play political bets, shake the opponent's hand, then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi has no answer
 or wo bhi aakraamak andaaj main
 But this time Modi has chosen a completely new path, the way of fasting
 desh ke naam likhe khat main modi ne likhaa he-mere pyaare bhaaiyon or bahanon, sadar pranaam
 This campaign of mine is dedicated to the name of society and country whose aim is unity and brotherhood
 modi aage likhte hai
 
 
 Gujarat got out of difficulties and started on the path of development
 aaj yahaan aman he, ekta he, saamaajik sauhaard or bhaichara he
 The history of India is a witness that casteism and sectarianism did not benefit the society
 gujarat dange ke 9 saal baad ab modi ko is baat kaa bhi ahsaas ho chalaa he ki rajya chalaane vaale ko rajdharm kaa paalan karnaa chahie
 Modi further writes, no society or state can claim to be ideal
 main un logon kaa shukraguzaar hum jinhone pichley 10 saalon main meri galatiyon ko jaahir kiya
 Being a Chief Minister is a problem for any citizen
 sabhi ko insaaf muhaiyaa karana rajya kaa ferj he
 That is, Modi is excited after the Supreme Court's decision, but somewhere he is also sorry for the 2002 riots
 tabhi to kabhi virodhiyon ke saath aar-paar kii ladaai main yakeen rakhanevaale modi ab unke prati naram hone kii baat kah rahe hai
 The Chief Minister of Gujarat has written, 'during three days i will pray to God that i do not have bad thoughts for those people who have made false accusations to defame me or Gujarat
 'saaf he modi ne is baar congress par hamalaa bolne ke liye gandhigiri kii raah chuni he
 But the truth is that Modi's great ambition is hidden in this fast
 modi khud ko bijepi kaa bhavi pradhanmantri ke rup main dekh rahe hai
 The way in the recent report of the American Congressional Research, he has been considered as a contender for the post of PM, Modi feels that he has a great chance to shine his image
 pashchim bengal sarkaar ne chunaav ayog ko patr likhaa he
 West Bengal government secretary Atri Bhattacharya has been accused of manipulating the election
 chunaav ayog se anurodh kiya gaya he ki bengal main kendriya sashastr balon kii niyukti ko vah khud dekhen
 Apart from this, questions have also been raised about local authorities not being in the Rapid Procedure Team (QRT)
 chunaav ayog ko likhe patr main kaha gaya he ki chunaav ke dauraan kendriya sashastr balon (CAPF) kii niyukti par dhyaan kendrit karnaa chaahate hai
 You will be aware of the firing done by CAPF on 12 May

 According to reports, during the 4-phase election, the CAPF carried out aerial firing at Dubrajpur in Panrui and Birbhum districts

 During the fifth phase elections, security forces were used on the MP in Howrah
 hathiyaaron ke saath CAPF jawan poling booth main ghus gaye, jabaki aisa karnaa aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan he
 It should be noted that during the sixth phase election, lathicharge and firing were done by CAPF
 pehle charan ke chunaav main twarit pratikriya team main kisi bhi sthaneey adhikari ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 Any force from outside has difficulty in performing its duty because it is not aware of the local language and the region
 parinamswaroop shikaayat ke ek ghante baad bhi twarit pratikriya team maukey par nahin pahunchi kyonki unhen ilaake kii jaankaree hi nahin thi
 The letter stated that CAPF is used as an additional resource
 aise main unke saath ek local officer hota he jo sthaneey matadaata se baat kar sake
 Therefore, i request that there should be no investigation of any local officer in the Quick Response Team

 The victim's father and his lawyer raised a second question, that political parties are trying to save Pinto, the owner of the school? And the third question is why the central government is not answering their request
 bataa den ki pinto family ko jila prashasan ne saman kiya tha, lekin ab tak ve police kii pahunch se dur hai
 Thakur's lawyer Sushil Tekriwal asked who was protecting Pinto and why? He said that if the CBI does not take charge of the case in the next 24 hours, then there is no way left for us to go to the Supreme Court
 tekriwal ne is baat kii ore ishaara kiya ki gres pinto ke raajnneetik conection hai

 South Korea's friendship with the world's most powerful country, the US, is going through something so cruel to its neighbor North Korean dictator Kim Jong that it has even threatened to wage a nuclear war against it

 The world is already aware of the fact that Kim Jong, who shot his enemies in front of wild dogs and crocodiles, is already aware of his nature and in such a way that if this dictator actually executes his threat then When, where, how much and how it will affect, Kim Jong-un himself will not be proud of this

 balki dakshin korea ke ek pravaktaa ne saaf kar diya he ki agar uttar korea ne koi bhi gaiyr jimmedaari harakat kii, to use uski baari keemat chukaani padegi
 South Korea has even given that their army is fully prepared to launch a precise and effective attack in North Korea and they want to tell that there is no scope for any kind of mercy in this war
 haalanki ek-duusare ko daraane dhamkaane ke silsile kaa yahi ant nahin he
 Rather now Japan has also warned North Korea to avoid any such act
 gift main mila hydrogen bamkisi sanakee taanashaah ke haath main duniya ke sabase taqatvar or sabase khatarnaak bam kaa hona ek phikr kii baat he
 And that too a bomb which will destroy any big city in just minutes
 haal hi main uttar korea ke taanashaah kim jong un ke berthde par uske vaigyanikon ne use aisa hi khatarnaak hydrogen bam gift main diya he
 These blasts of atomic bombs on Japan's two cities, Haroshima and Nagasaki, on 6 and 9 August 1945, are still the dark pages of history, which make Rongte stand out from memory
 tab mahaj do parmaanu bamon ne japan ke in do shaharon main sava do lakh se zyada logon kii jaan le lee thi
 Now think of that hydrogen bomb which is hundred times more powerful than any such atomic bomb dropped on these two cities
 agar aisa koi bam kisi shahar par gira diya jaae, to anjaam kya hoga? bas, itnaa samaj lijie ki ek hidrogen bam karod-dedh karod kii aabaadi vaale kisi bhi shahar ko minuton main puri tarah se matiamet kar saktaa he
 And this is the reason that at this time, if there is one of the biggest items of destruction in the world, then it is the hydrogen bomb
 haalanki pichley saal sitambar main hi washington sthit 'institute for science and international security ne north korea ke yangyon newclear complex main khatarnaak vepan develop karne kaa shaq jaahir kar diya tha
 The think tank had said on the basis of satellite images that North Korea had developed a technique for making hydrogen bombs
 or 6 janvari ko sachmuch north korea ne hydrogen bam kaa pareekshan kar liya
 The Axis of Evils, the devil's axis, America has imposed many restrictions on Kim's country

 He makes his move

 The dictator himself determines the future of the people of North Korea
 dakshin korea or america ke saath lagaataar tanaav ke chalate yahaan hameshaa yuddh jaise halaat bane rahete hai
 Therefore, to increase its military strength, this dictator orders people from every household to forcefully join the army
 itnaa hi nahin, sena kii takat badhaane ke liye ladakiyon ko bhi jabardastee sainik banaata he
 North Korea is facing the brunt of this dictator
 lekin ab ye baaki duniya ko bhi gidadbhabhaki de rahaa he
 Sometimes Japan sometimes warns America of nuclear attack and now it is also equipped with hydrogen bomb
 jaahir he ise jaldi nahin roka gaya to puri duniya ke liye khatra ban saktaa he

 After the Pulwama attack in February this year, because of the tense atmosphere, so far, the export of tea to Pakistan is feared to gain payment in 50% of the total number of businessmen
 Tea exports from India to Pakistan have fallen drastically by over 50 per cent due to tense atmosphere
 janvari se agast 2019 ke dauraan bharat se pakistan ko chaay kaa niryaat sirf 48 lakh dollar (kareeb 34 karod rupee) mulya ke 31

 7 lakh kilogram kaa hua tha
 In comparison, tea exports from India to Pakistan increased by 22% in the first 10 months of the year 2018
 3 karod kigra kaa hua tha
 According to Business Standard, Pakistan is the world's largest tea importer
 pakistan har saal kareeb 56 karod dollar mulya ke chaay kaa aayaat karata he, jabaki rus har saal 49 karod dollar mulya ke chaay kaa aayaat karata he
 Why exports fell from India to Pakistan during January to August 2019, according to the figures of Export Board 31
 4 lakh kilogram kaa hua tha
 Exporters say that the main reason for the decline in tea exports to Pakistan is that in the atmosphere of tension between the two countries, traders are reluctant to do business against public sentiment, and other traders fear of getting payment Made, therefore, traders are now reducing tea exports to Pakistan
 vyapaariyon kaa kahana he ki pakistani vyapaaree aamtaur par to pement dene main koi gadabad nahin karte, lekin pulavama hamale ke baad maahaul badal gaya he
 The situation is bad, so there is apprehension among the traders about whether they will get payment for the goods they send
 pulavama ke baad bigadaa maahaulagauratlab he ki is saal farvari main huepulawama hamale main kendriya rigerv police bal (CRPF) ke 40 jawan shahid hoge the

 iske baad maahaul kaaphi tanaavpurn ho gaya or bharat sarkaar ne pakistani vastuon ke aayaat par 200 fisadi kaa aayaat kar laga diya
 This severely hampered trade and trade between the two countries is almost at a standstill
 haalanki pakistan ne apni jaruraton ko dekhte hue bhartiya chaay ke aayaat par aayaat shulk 11 fisadi kaa hi barkaraar rakhaa he
 Pakistan has been a good market especially for the affordable tea variety of South India

 The reasoning behind these reports was that despite the official announcement of the merger of the Janata Parivar, a 'sign, a flag and a leader' could not be decided yet for this 'mahadal'
 ek angreji akhbaar ne sutron ke hawaale se khabar di ki 'takneekee masalon' kii vajah se donon partiyon samet janata parivaar kii sabhi chah partiyon kaek chunaav chinhake neeche aana vidhansabha chunaav se pehle sambhav nahin he
 This is also confirmed by the fact that RJD MP Prem Gupta has agreed to the statement of Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav in which he denied the possibility of completion of the process of Janata Parivar before the assembly elections
 prem gupta ne bhi mana ki kuch takneekee muddon kii vajah se mahavilay kii prakriya ko hold par rakhana padaa he

 'agenda aaj tak-2014' main amit shah ne kaha, sarkaar ko kuch samay dijie, ham kaala dhan waapas laaenge
 We are working in the right direction
 amit shah ne kaha ki sarkaar is maamle main gatirodh dur karne ke liye sabhi jaruri kadam uthaa rahi he
 He said, SIT has been formed and the issue of black money has been raised in international forums
 mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki ham kaala dhan laane main safal honge
 In the same program, Amit Shah also said that the Congress party is slowly sinking, as the party has suffered a crushing defeat in the recent assembly elections
 shah ne kaha, 2014 ke aam chunaav main bharat ke logon ne bijepi ko spasht bahumat diya
 The Congress does not have leadership in the 15 administrative units of the country nor is the leader of the opposition in Parliament
 unhone aage kaha, jahaan bhi chunaav ho rahe hai, log bijepi kaa samarthan kar rahe hai or modi ke vikaas kaary ke kaaran varsh 2019 tak congress buree tarah harati rahegi
 Shah said, the day is not far when we will achieve the goal of Congress-free country
 bhartiya janata party ne uttar pradesh main prachand bahumat laakar itihaas rach diya
 The election strategy and management of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah are once again stamped
 piem modi ne upi main 20 se zyada reliyaan kii or har raily main vikaas ke mudde ko jor-shor se uthaaya
 But, now that the BJP has a strong majority and is preparing to form the government, there are many challenges before the BJP
 chunaav se pehle bijepi ne apane ghoshnaa patr main kai loklubhaavan vaayade kiye jinhone logon ko apni ore aakarshith kiya
 But now this is the biggest challenge before the BJP
 kyonki aise kai vaayadon ko puraa karne main bijepi kaa pasinaa chhot saktaa he
 1
 kisaanon kaa karj mafapradhanmantri narendra modi ne prachaar ke samay lagbhag har raily main iskaa zikr kiya he ki unki sarkaar banate hi pehali meeting main unki party is vaade ko puraa karegi
 According to this promise, loans of all small farmers will be forgiven, while interest will be freed
 vahiin ganna kisaanon ko fasal bechney ke 14 dinon ke adanr unka bhugtan karne kaa vaada bijepi ne kiya he
 Significantly, after this fierce victory, the BJP is under pressure to keep this promise, and the eyes of the entire country including the entire state are on the first cabinet meeting after the formation of the government
 2
 The BJP also promised free wi-fi in UP this time on the lines of free wi-fi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in all colleges, universities
 lagata he ki bijepi kaa yah vaada pradesh ke yuvaaon ko kaaphi pasand aayaa
 Giving free wi-fi in all the colleges and universities of the state can prove to be a pity for the BJP government
 is vaade ke liye bade bajet ke saath hi kam samay par ise lagu karnaa uske liye chunauti hogi
 3
 laptop ke saath 1 jibi datapurv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kii tarj par free laptop kaa vaada or saath hi 1 jibi free data dene kaa vaada bijepi sarkaar ke liye ek badi chunauti ke rup main ubharegaa
 Akhilesh Yadav has consistently claimed that he has distributed more than 1
5 million laptops
 is aankade kii barabari karnaa bijepi ke liye chunauti hogi
 However, the BJP alleged that the Akhilesh government distributed laptops on the basis of discrimination and that it would distribute the laptops without discrimination
 4
 24 hours electricity, police in 15 minutes Electricity and law system were one of the biggest issues during the Uttar Pradesh elections
 piem modi lagaataar bijli naa aane ko lekar akhilesh yadav or rahul gandhi par nishaanaa sadhate rahe the or akhilesh ne har raily main upi 100 kaa gungan kiya he
 It will not be easy for the BJP government to strengthen law and order in such a large state with 24 hours of electricity
 bijepi ke ghoshnaptr ke mutabik phone karne ke 15 minute ke andar police mauka-e-vaardaat par maujuud hogi
 This truth will be known only after the government comes

 Ram Mandir, Teen Divorce and Anti Romeo Dalram Mandir, Teen Divorce and Anti Romeo Dal are different parts of bjp's Hindutva agenda
 bijepi kaaphi samay se kahati ai he ki upi main purna bahumat aane par ram mandir banaaya jayega, haalanki vah kahati he ki supreme court ke nirdesh ke baad hi yah banaaya jayega
 At the same time, BJP had said in the manifesto that after discussing the issue of triple talaq with the Muslim women, it will take a decision on it, it will have to be seen how she moves forward on this issue
 vahiin mahilaon ke prati chhedchhad kii ghatnaon ko rokane ke liye bijepi ne anti romeo dal banane kaa vaada kiya tha, is vaade par sabhi kii najar he kyonki pashchimi uttar pradesh samet puure soobe main mahilaon kii suraksha ek ahm mudda he

 emsidi chunaav najadik aate hi raajnneetik sargharmiyaan badhane lagi hai
 Previously, where BJP has been saying that the battle of Delhi is with Aam Aadmi Party, but now BJP has started realizing that the real fight in this election is with Congress
 bijepi saansad vijay goyal ne shungalu cameti kii report ko lekar congress ke kaala diwas manaane kii ghoshnaa par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 Vijay Goyal said, 'this time in the MCD election, the Congress is competing against the Aam Aadmi Party
 272 ward vaale emsidi chunaavon ke baad aap tisare paaydaan par rahegi
 'let me tell you that MCD elections are to be held in Delhi on 23 April
 vijay goyal ne kaha ki agar emsidi chunaav main nateeja spasht nahin aata he to satta ke liye congress or aam aadmi party haath mila sakate hai
 So at the same time, corruption of Sheila Dixit government of Delhi's Janata Congress, especially the Commonwealth Game, CNG, Low Floor Bus and Jal Board Tanker Scam is not yet forgotten
 vartmaan arvind kejariwal kii sarkaar bhrashtachar main congress kaa hi anusaran hi kar rahi he
 Who used to roam till yesterday with investigation reports against others
 aaj khud jaanch reporton se batch kar bhaag rahe hai
 He alleged that the Congress is more guilty than the present Kejriwal government for the plight of the people of Delhi today because the Congress had helped in bringing the Aam Aadmi Party into political existence in 2011-12
 or phir 2013 main kejariwal sarkaar banavaakar dilli main niskriyata, bhrashtachar or sanvaidhanik gatirodh kaa daur shuru karavaaya
 At the same time, the Delhi Congress president is making many claims to enable municipal corporations today, but the public remembers what was happening in Delhi in the Congress-ruled corporation of 2002 to 2007
 jiske falswaroop congress buree tarah haari thi
 After which the people chose BJP for 10 years and now again the BJP will have the opportunity to serve in all the three corporations
 vijay goyal ne kaha dilli kii janata ko yaad he ki shila dikshit sarkaar ne bina soche samajhe 2012 main nagar nigam kaa bantwaaraa kiya or phir purvi dilli nagar nigam ke saath to vishesh dhokhaa kiya or unhen seed mani ke 300 karod rupaye tak nahin die, vartmaan kejariwal sarkaar bhi gat do varsho se usee paripati par chalakar nigamon ko aarthik rup se pangu karti rahi he
 He also said that the Aam Aadmi Party has slipped to the third position in this election and due to this, the Kejriwal parties have gone awry, but the Congress, which is neither in the Center nor in the Delhi Government, knows on what basis the public is talking about the development of Delhi
 Has been unhone kaha ki aam aadmi party or congress donon satta lolup hai or 2013 kii tarah kabhi bhi punah gathbandhan kar sakate hai
 The people of Delhi understand the poor politics of these two parties and will support the Bharatiya Janata Party for the development of better Delhi
 saansad vijay goyal ne kaha ki jahaan congress bhrashtachari party he to vahi aap party avaidh aamadani party he
 The High Court has rejected a petition filed by the Aam Aadmi Party regarding the VVPAT in the MCD election
 court ne kaha ki ek din ke baad chunaav he or itane kam samay me 13 hazaar mashiinon ko badalanaa sambhav nahin he
 Therefore elections should be conducted only with M-1 EVM machines
 brihaspativaar ko AAP ne hoicourt main yachika daayar kar VVPAT se emsidi chunaav karaane kii maang kii thi
 The Delhi Election Commission made it clear in the High Court about the VVPAT machine that the Supreme Court has asked to use the VVPAT in elections, but the Supreme Court has not said anywhere that the use of the Generation One M-1 machine is prohibited
 M-1 non hackable mashin he
 There is no tampering in this machine
 iskaa pareekshan kiya ja saktaa he
 How can the credibility of the machine be questioned, while the Aam Aadmi Party, which accused the machine of tampering, has no evidence in this regard
 M-1 mashiinon se chunaav karana bhi utana hi surakshit he, jitna VVPAT se karana he
 The VVPAT has a printer and is expensive to use
 lihaaja iske liye zyada fund kii zarurat he
 Recently a by-election was held in Rajouri Garden, VVPAT was used in it
 is up chunaav main aam aadmi party kii zamaanat bhi zabt ho gai
 In such a situation, the truth of the allegations of AAP can be gauged
 is vaqt VVPAT kaa istemaal sambhav hi nahi he, kyonki chunaav prakriya ke lienotification lagu ho chukaa he
 If any changes are made, the election will be delayed

 pichley hafte madhya pradesh ke shivpuri ilaake se ek tasviir ai thi, tasviir main picnic manaate kuch log sailaab main fanse dikhaai dete hai
 That inundation had taken nine people with them to death, but now we are going to tell you the story of this incident, which you will feel yourself walking every step of death
 teen minute main dabe paanv pani kii shakl memmautakaise laharaate hue aa rahi thi, wo manjar is video main live kaid ho gaya
 a new picture of catastrophe has been revealed in Jalpuri in Shivpuri
 saamne aayaa haadase kaa sabase nayaa video
 How the 'cataclysm' suddenly occurred during a picnic
 picnic sthal kaise bana zindagi or maut kii jang kaa gavaah
 How suddenly the flood occurred in MP Shivpuri on August 15
 madhya pradesh main maut kaa piknicye khulaasa us nae video se hoga jo ab saamne aayaa he
 It is clear from this video that came out after about 7 days, that people who were having a picnic on the rock of Sultangarh waterfall could not even get a clue that there is a doom in the back of the water
 15 agast 2018chuttee kaa din tha
 Evening time shivpuri ke sultangadh jharne main saikadon log is chattan par baith kar zindagi ke maze le rahe the
 Unaware of this, the flood is coming
 shivpuri main parvati nadi kaa ye wo ilaaka he jo pahadiyon se guzarataa he
 Often the river dries up by coming here
 ilaake ke logon ke liye ye behtareen picnic spot ban jaataa he
 Even that day, there was no bar for water
 log masti kar rahe the ki achaanak nadi main pani aana shuru ho gaya
 Water came very fast, little water came before it
 phir or pani aayaa
 Those who were threatened, immediately started running towards the shore
 tasviren dekhie ye kareeb aadha darjan log ek duusare kaa haath pakad kar kinare kii taraf bad chale
 On the way, one of his companions slipped into the water's edge
 magar isane akalmandi dikhaai or pathar ke ek kone ko majbooti se pakad liya
 On one side, he was struggling with the edge of water and on the other side right in front of him
 kareeb aadha darjan log abhi bhi ye samaj nahin paa rahe the ki maamla gambhir hone vaala he
 Then two of them quickly showed themselves and started moving towards the shore
 aate aate in logon ne us shaks kaa haath bhi pakadakar uske khinch liya jo pani kii dhar se baahar nikalne ke liye jujh rahaa tha
 One by one, all the people started running towards the shore, but this person started trying to run to the shore through water alone
 magar pani kesailabane use sanbhalane nahin diya
 First he slipped
 phir gira
 But somehow he overcame the situation and came to the shore to save his life
 lekin abhi bhi kareeb kai log sailaab ke bich bich fanse hue the
 For whom it was now impossible to cross this inundation by running or walking like this
 pani or uski raftaar donon badhane lagi
 The stones which were still visible on the Parvati river were also submerged in water
 sailaab puri tarah se aa gaya
 People started flowing one by one
 ab kisi ke liye kuch karne kaa mauka hi nahin bachaa
 They now had only two routes
 yaa to sailaab ke saamne sarender kar den
 Or fight against death
 sailaab main fansi 45 logon kii jindagiyanis sailaab ke saamne sarender karne kaa matlab sirf maut tha
 45 people were stranded
 fanse hue the or intjaar kar rahe the ki kisi tarah sailaab kaa gussa kam ho or wo kinare pahunch jaaen
 Or if someone comes to save them
 magar vakt kam tha or pani kaa bahaav har pal tej hota ja rahaa tha
 Desperate to take away everything, trying to save someone without preparation in this water was also nothing short of suicide
 sochie pani kaa sailaab or kareeb 45 logon ke liye jaan bachaane ko sirf ye chattan
 The grip of the hand cannot be strong enough to hold it even in this flow of water
 ek ek karke haath chhot rahe the
 Someone fell first
 phir koi
 And then a series of successes started
 is tarah 12 log bah gaye
 The ones who were standing here in the flood or jo udhar khadey the udhar
 Left rubbing hands
 koun bhala himmat karegaa is sailaab main utarkar kisi jaan bachaane kii
 Because landing in it means losing one's life
 un tak pahunchnaa to khayr bahut baad kii baat he
 In flood, direct combat with death, such a rapid flow of water that can carry even the heaviest things with you
 wo to in logon kii faaulad jaisi ichha shakti he
 Which these people are coping with death between the waves
 sailaab jo sabakuch baha le jane ko betaab he wo kya itnaa intazaar karegaa ki inhen bachaane ko rassi aa jaae
 Or reach the administration
 kyonki ab vakt bahut kam bachaa he
 As long as his will power is intact, then only his breath can go on
 varanaa kisi bhi pal is sailaab main samaa jaati 45 zindagiyaan

 In Taliban attack in Kabul, a man first entered himself in the bus, then a blast and many lives were silenced
 ye hamalaa us samay hua jab canadian ambysi main suraksha main tainaat surakshakarmi apni duty ke liye ja rahe the
 The attack took place in Kabul when all the security personnel were boarding a mini bus at 6 in the morning that suddenly the speed of the bus slowed down a bit on a speed breaker, and quickly entered a suicide bus and in the blink of an eye She blew herself with an RDX belt tied at her waist
 dekhte hi dekhte uske saath hi 12 se zyada logon ke parakhche ud gaye
 Some similar information was given by the Embassy of India to Sooraj, the elder brother of Ganesh Thapa, who died in the same attack
 ganesh kii 9 saal kii bitiyaa he jise shaayad abhi ehsaas hi nahin he ki uske papa ab kabhi lautakar nahin aaenge
 Supriya, studying in the fourth grade, is trying to understand something by looking at her mother and all the people together, but it will probably take time for her to understand that her father's life has been taken by such people who have ever committed his father
 There was no enmity
 aisa hi haal ganesh ke puure parivaar kaa he
 The mother is sad and the wife is in a bad state
 tippaniyan Another such family is also from Dehradun, the house which has lost its lamp
 ye ghar he ganesh ke hi saath is hamale main maare gaye govind singh kaa jo aatmghaatee hamale ke vaqt usee bas main maujuud the
 Govinda's wife is also weeping, which the family and the people around can only comfort because the cruel hands of death have taken away Govind from them forever
 hamale se kuch hi minute pehle govind ne apni patni ko phone kiya tha par antim samay aane se pehle govind apni patni se baat nahin kar paaya
 But in his last time he messaged his wife via whatsapp, "janu i miss you '" and then a blast and everything was over
 govind apana ek ashiana bana rahe the dehradun kii khubasurat vaadiyon main, jise wo bilkul videshi andaaz main taiyaar karvaa rahe the or jiskaa nakshaa bhi unhone vishesh taur par saudi arab se banwaaya tha
 But now that dream was his dream
 ghar abhi adhuraa hi he or ab use taiyaar karwaane vaala is duniya main hi nahin he

 a few minutes before the attack, Govind called his wife, but Govind could not talk to his wife before the last time
 par apane antim samay main usne apni patni ko whatsap ke jariye ek massej kiya, "janu i miss you'' or uske baad ek dhamaakaa or sab kuch khatm
 Govind was making his own home in the beautiful plains of Dehradun, which he was getting prepared in a completely foreign style and which was also specially designed from Saudi Arabia
 par ab unka wo sapana sapana hi rah gaya
 The house is still incomplete and it is not in this world to get it ready

 jammu seemaa par pakistan kii ore se31 disambar se lagaataar firingeho rahi he, vahiin porbandar main26 / 11 kii tarj par aatanki hamaleka khaakaa taiyaar kiya gaya
 Intelligence report confirms that the destroyed boat in Porbandar was from Karachi
 yah vahi pakistan he, jisane haal hi peshawar main aatanki hamale kaa dansh jhela he
 But the way intrusions into India from across the border have intensified, it directly points to the visit of Chief Guest Barack Obama to India on 26 January
 haalanki, jammu main pakistan se lagi antarrashtriya seemaa par ravivaar raat lagbhag shanti rahi he, lekin paak rangers kii ore se do-teen round firing jarur hui, jiskaa biguef ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 BSF says that we never respond to firing two or four rounds, retaliation is done only when there is more firing
 khufia agenciyon kii report ke mutabik, pakistan ke napak iraade 26 janvari ko ganatantr diwas samaaroh main aatanki khalal daalane kii koshish ho sakati he
 On the occasion of Republic Day, US President Barack Obama is the Chief Guest and in the past, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's successful visit to America is also in the eyes of Pakistan
 bataaya jaataa he ki bharat main aatanki vaardaat or ghuspaith ko anjaam dene ke liye aatankiyon ne 8-9 group bana liye hai, jo antarrashtriya seemaa main dakhal dene kii lagaataar koshish kar rahe he
 The Pakistani army's hand on the head of the terrorists consists of 40 to 45 people in these groups of terrorists
 yahi nahin, in sabhi ko pakistani sena kii sarapasti bhi mili hui he
 The way Pakistan consistently violated ceasefire in Samba on Friday and in Kathua sector on Saturday also reinforces the infiltration of terrorists
 shanivaar raat ek ore jahaan kathua or samba sector main raat bhar goliyon kii aawaaj goonjati rahi, vahiin border par golibari ke bich pakistan kii ore se kuch aatankwaadi graminon ke bhesh main border paar karne kii koshish karte hue dekhe gaye
 If sources of intelligence agencies are to be believed, then they may be lashkar-e-taiba terrorists, who are in the process of entering the country
 khufia sutron ke mutabik, samba ke chilyaari gaanv ke paas seemapar pakistani gaanv- chakbura, makwaal, or lambiar main kai log jamaat-ud-daawa ke chif or mumbai hamale ke gunahagaar hafiz said ke samarthan main naare lagaate dikhe
 Intelligence agencies suspect that in the form of villagers, it is the let terrorists who are looking for infiltration
 sutron ke mutabik, har gaanv main aise 30 se 40 log dikhe
 According to the official report, in 2014, Pakistan violated the ceasefire in Jammu and Kashmir 555 times
 raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne beete dinon hi sansad ko bataaya tha ki 405 baar sarhad par sijafire kaa ulanghan hua
 Of these, 334 occurred in Jammu sector while 61 times in indreshwar-nagar sector
 jabaki pakistan sijafire ulanghan ke baad siinaajori par utar aayaa he
 He has alleged that there is firing from the Indian side of the border
 pakistani pradhanmantri navaj sharif ke salaahkaar sartaaj ajij ko likhi chitthee main videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne bhi saaf kar diya ki sijafire kaa ulanghan pakistan kar rahaa he naa ki bharat
 India has repeatedly indicated that retaliation will also stop if firing from Pakistan is stopped
 sutron ke mutabik sushamaa swaraj ne pakistan par teen gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 The first of these is using large and modern weapons on the Pakistan border
 doosraa, pakistan ladaai ke daayre ko badha rahaa he or teesraa, pakistan rihaayshi ilaake ko nishaanaa bana rahaa he

 He said that a search was also done at Suraj's house and letters and electronic equipment were recovered
 unhone daleel di ki suraj ko hiraasat main lekar or poochtacha karne kii jarurat nahin he

 taliban yaad he naa aapako? vahi jisane bagdadi se pehle afghanistan or pakistan main maut ke nae-nae tareeke ijad kiye the

 vahi taliban jisane philhal aadhe se zyada afghanistan par kabja kiya hua he
 Now it is going to get open independence in Afghanistan once again because the US President Donald Trump, who has decided to see Nafa Nakusan, has announced the withdrawal of the US Army in Afghanistan for 17 years
 yani taliban ko ek baar phir se khadaa hone kaa mauka milane ja rahaa he
 American troops return home The last consignment of the American military will leave Afghanistan
 7000 america sainik afghanistan chodenge
 The Taliban and Pakistan are happy with the US military's departure
 magar america ke faisle se bharat kii chintaa bad sakati he
 17 years later, American troops are leaving from Afghanistan
 america ne elaan kar diya he ki wo afghanistan main maujuud america sainikon kii aakhri khep ko waapas bula rahaa he
 There are currently about 7000 American soldiers in Afghanistan
 america raashtrapati donald trump ke is elaan se duniyabar main khalabali much gai he
 Many countries are happy with this decision and many are angry
 kyonki amareeki sena pichley kai saalon se afghanistan main rahete hue taliban ke kilaaf lagaataar ladaai lard rahi thi
 The us-led coalition forces ousted the Taliban from Afghanistan's power in 2001
 
 And since then, conflict has continued between the two in Afghanistan
 baavjood iske ab bhi taliban ke paas kareeb saath hazaar ladaake hai
 Not only this, the Taliban occupied areas in Afghanistan have also increased
 yahi vajah he ki jaankaar ise aatmghaatee faisla maan rahe hai
 Because if this happens then once again Afghanistan can come under the control of Taliban
 1996 se 2001 tak afghanistan par taliban kaa raaj tha
 But after the 9 / 11 attacks, the US attacked the Taliban in Afghanistan
 tab se hi america sena taliban ke khilaaf lard rahi he
 It was due to his efforts that a democratic government was formed in Afghanistan
 magar ab jab america sarkaar ne sena waapas bulaane kaa faisla kar liya he, to ek baar phir afghanistan main uthal-puthal shuru ho gai he
 Indeed, US President Donald Trump feels that Afghanistan is a burden for America
 jo ranneetik hisaab se bhi zaruri sahyogi nahin he
 Trump also feels that keeping the US Army in Afghanistan is also financially harmful
 iske alaava taliban ko rokane ke liye use pakistan kaa saath bhi nahin mil rahaa he
 Therefore, the return of the army is in favor of America
 haalanki donald trump ke is faisle se jahaan afgaan sarkaar or bharat sarkaar naakhush he, vahiin khud america raksha mantri bhi iske haq main nahin hai
 According to him, this decision of the President can prove to be suicidal
 kyonki is faisle se puure mulk main ashaanti fail sakati he
 At the same time, this decision will prove to be a boon for the Taliban
 use khud ko dobaaraa khadaa karne kaa mauka mil jayega
 Now whether this decision of Trump is right or wrong will tell the time to come
 magar isse pakistan bahut khush he
 Because for one reason, there was frequent tension between America and Pakistan because of Afghanistan
 doosraa ab wo afghanistan main apana dakhal bhi badha saktaa he
 Which will not be right for India
 surkhiyon main aayaa talibasemerica ke is faisle ke baad haashiye par ja chukaa taliban ek baar phir achaanak surkhiyon main aa gaya he
 But the question is why America has succumbed to the Taliban
 kyonki 17 saalon ke sangharsh ke baad bhi america sena afghanistan ko taliban se puri tarah azaad nahin kara pai he
 So for this, those pages of the date have to be reversed when this terrorist organization was born
 darasal, taliban us shay kaa naam he, jo aaj tak koi bhi jang nahin haara
 His enemy dominated whenever
 usne behad chaalaaki se apane kadam peeche khinche
 Strengthened himself
 dushman ke laaparvaah hote hi us par dobaaraa waar kar diya
 History is witness that due to this strategy, every military campaign against him has made the Taliban stronger, more dangerous and more dangerous than before
 taliban kii shuruyaat hi afghanistan par kabje kii ladaai se hui thi
 The Taliban started this war in late 1994 under the patronage of Mullah Omar
 is dauraan dakshini afghanistan main use sthaneey kabilaayiyon ke jabardast virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 But the Taliban did not give up and in September 2006 captured the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul
 taliban kii is hukumat ko 1997 main milatri commander ahamed shah masood ne lalakaara
 But the very next year, the Taliban emerged with double strength and killed again thousands of fighters and common people and regained control of Afghanistan
 taliban ke khooni safar kii ye mahaj shuruyaat bhar thi
 Because after this, the Taliban slowly spread throughout Afghanistan like termites
 naubat yahaan tak aa gai ki 2001 ke aakhir tak afghanistan ke 90 fisadi hisse par taliban kaa hi raaj chalata tha
 The unilateral rule of the Taliban posed a historic challenge to the United States and the Common Army after the 2001 World Trade Center attacks
 puure afghanistan main taliban ke khilaaf chale is ghamaasan ke baad taliban se satta chin kar america ne apni nigaraanee main afghanistan main nordarn alliance kii sarkaar banavaa di
 But despite this fight that lasted for years, he could not get Afghanistan free from the claws of the Taliban till date
 apni fitrat ke chalate 2004 main talibanek baar phir afghanistan main lautaa or tabase ab tak rah-rah kar america or saajha senaaon par hamale kar rahaa he
 The Taliban adopted more or less the same method in Pakistan
 2006 se lekar ab tak taliban ke khilaaf pakistani fouj darjanon morchon par jang lard chuki he
 The Taliban have also retraced several times
 magar jaise hi paak fouj usko haara samaj waapas lauti
 The Taliban has returned once again with double strength
 yani kabhi samjhaute se, kabhi maan munwwal se, kabhi sharia or islam kaa hawala dekar to kabhi awam ke naam par taliban apane paanv jamaane ke liye har mumkin tarkeeb apanaataa rahaa he

 To know why Robert Vadraco came so angry when he asked a question, it is more important for you to know who Robert Vadra is? You are living in the era when water is of 'bisleri', 'akash' of Ambani, 'agni' of Ram Gopal Varma, Modi's 'hawa' and 'land' of Vadra
 aise main kya haq banataa he kisi ANI ko ki wadra ji sejamini sawalpuche? kam logon ko pataa hoga ki unke pita kaa muradabad main pital kaa bada kaarobaar tha tabhi to kam log hi ‘ye duniya pittal kii’ kaa arth samaj paae, nahin to duniya pittal kii bajaay steel vaale mittal kii bhi to ho sakati thi
 Do you know why about 70 percent of the Earth is in water? So that Robert Vadra does not even make it his own
 isiilie to wo jab bhi kahin khaali jameen dekhte hai unke dimag main ‘tuje apana banane kii kasam khai he’ gunjane lagata he
 i remembered another anecdote of his life associated with the song itself
 ek baar priyanka wadra gaanaa gunaguna raheen thi, wadra sahab bagal se gujarey
 All that their ears heard was that 'balam, where you don't have a house, we don't have to pass through that street anymore'
 phir kya
 
 
 What happened then is history
 aaj bhi kabhi-kabhi priyanka, robert ko chidhaane ke liye ‘teri galiyon main na rakhenge kadam, aaj ke baad’ ga detii hai badale main wadra ‘jaaie aap kahaan jaaenge’ gunaguna dete hai
 Along with being Priyankapati, Vadra is also an industrialist
 wal street jarnal kii maane to 2007 main ek lakh rupee se shuru kiya gaya unka kaarobaar badhkar teen sau karod kaa ho chukaa he
 For the first time after Hansika Motwani in India's history, someone grew so quickly
 oxytone kaa injection lagane par lowki bhi itani jaldi nahin badhati
 Robert Vadra proved that human beings can do anything if they have elders on their heads, leaving behind questions like 'how can this happen'? kisi ko kya pataa tha ki itane bhale insaan par koi khemka, khamkhan oongli uthaa degaa
 Was it his fault that when he went to Haryana for the first time, he read 'haryana' as 'grabbing'? He was the first person who told us that despite being a 'common' man, we are living in 'banana Republic'
 wo aise bhale insaan hai ki desh ke liye kal ko lahore or beijing kii jameen ko bhi apana bana sakate hai
 The British too left India to take up their fields and barns only because they came to know that Robert Vadra is about to take incarnation in India
 ye kya unki galati he ki unhen jaminen itani aasaani se milti gayi jitani aasaani se aapako aapke mobile kaa flipakvar nahin miltaa? ye kya unki galati he ki bachapan main unhen kabj kii bajaay kabja ho jaataa tha? ye wo hi to the jinhone hamen bataaya ‘nuts’ sirf khaae nahin hadakaae bhi jate hai
 Even so, see how big the heart of the King Jamai is

 Army Chief Bipin Rawat's infiltration of Bangladeshi nationals into Assam and statements on the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) have led to political controversy since
 is bayaan ko lekar left netaa vrinda karaat ne sena pramukh par palatwaar kiya he
 He said that Army Chief Bipin Rawat is trying to politicize the army
 unhone kaha ki general ravat bhartiya sena ke pramukh hai or hamaare desh main army ke raajnneeti se dur rahane kii parampara he
 We have rules and we have a constitutional framework
 wo agar ek baar kehete hai, to samajha ja saktaa tha ki galati ho gai, lekin wo baar-baar bayaanbaji kar rahe hai
 They are trying to politicize the army by making such statements
 unke bayanon main sampradayikta bhi puri tarah hoti he
 CPM leader Vrinda Karatne appealed on the issue that the President should take cognizance of the matter seriously
 vrinda karaat ne kaha ki sena pramukh kaa raajnneetik bayaan behad galat he or isamen bahut gambhirtha se raashtrapati ko sangyaan lene kii jarurat he
 He questioned who is the Chief of Army Staff discussing such issues? Only those who have been elected in the country's parliament or state assemblies have the right to speak on it
 yah raajnneeti se jude logon kaa kaary kshetra he
 In such a situation, how is the army chief repeatedly commenting? The CPM leader said that Bipin Rawat's comment was ruining the military's non-political reputation
 yah bilkul galat he or ab dekhnaa yah he ki is maamle main rakshaamantri kya karenge? yah puraa maamla hi raajnneetik he
 Therefore the President needs to intervene in this
 unhone kaha ki maamla chaahe kuch bhi ho, lekin sena pramukh kaa kaary kshetra raajnneeti nahin he
 Vrinda Karat said that the Sena would tell the Chief Minister that even if we debate on the temple-mosque issue, is this method correct? He cannot make any rhetoric on the issues and political issues related to the policies of any country
 unako aise bayaan dene kii koi jarurat nahin he
 He is making so much rhetoric, as if he is contesting somewhere
 isse pehle army chif ke bayaan par AIUDF chif badaruddin ajmal ne kaha ki general bipin ravat kaa bayaan raajnneeti se prerit he, joki chaunkaane vaala he
 Apart from this, AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi and several other political parties have also questioned the statement of the Army Chief

 One of the two trucks, which ran from Delhi's Indira Gandhi Airport at night, was looted by two miscreants aboard the Tata Sumo at the point of a knife
 mangalvaar raat ko kareeb 12
 At 50 minutes, when a truck filled with the electronic circuit of Samsung Mobile reached near Kalindi Kunj, one of the two trucks was looted by miscreants in filmy style
 badmaashon ne pehle trek ko takkar maari, phir driver kii pitayee karke trek le bhaage
 The police reached the chance-e-incident within 5 to 10 minutes
 jab police ko trek ke luute gaye maal kii keemat (26 karod rupee) ke bare main pataa chalaa, police hakki-bakki rah gai
 When the police started an immediate investigation, it was found that only 2 minutes after the robbery, the miscreants had disconnected the GPS connection of the truck
 tabhi uske shaq kii sui transport company main kaam karne vaale karmchaariyon par tik gai
 Maninder Singh, SHO of Sarita Vihar Police Station, says that it was from here that the first clue struck him
 jab company kaa data or khangala gaya, to pataa chalaa ki pramod naam kaa ek karmchaaree saal bhar pehle company chhodkar chalaa gaya tha
 The location of his mobile was with Kalindi Kunj at that time
 isi se police ko suraag milte chale gaye
 These miscreants took a truck full of Samsung Mobile luggage first to Hathras, then took the goods from here and ran away from another truck to Kasganj
 yaheen dilli police ne chaar logon ko giraftaar kiya
 But now the biggest challenge before the police is who was the buyer of this robbery, because the people associated with Samsung say that if the police does not recover the stolen goods, then in delivery of Samsung's S-6 Edge It would have taken time and the company would have lost crores
 lutaa gaya saamaan korea se ai isi he, jisaki keemat 26 karod he
 One can buy it, which is related to making mobile
 isi ke chalate police is baat kii jaanch kar rahi he ki kahin karporate war ke chalate to ye lut nahin karai gai he
 Although Maninder Singh Randhawa, DCP of south-east, says that their investigation is still in the initial stage, but it is necessary for us to find out whether there was a buyer of these mobile devices or that these robbers in the misconception of being mobile carry through

 In October, the rating agency Fitch reduced the gross domestic product (GDP) growth estimate for this fiscal year 2019-20 to just 5
 5 fisadi kar diya
 Fitch said the growth rate could reach a six-year low due to a sharp decline in banks' loan disbursements

 Rai was asked in an interview that the BCCI received the money that the ICC had promised to give it under the 2014 revenue model? Rai said that he had asked the same question to the treasurer
 choudhary ne is par kaha ki raay ke is bayaan par unhen hansi ai thi, kyonki yah bataata he ki raay ko cricket prashasan ke bare main kuch bhi jaankaree nahin thi
 'rai is not aware of the cricket administration' Chaudhary told IANS that he did not know where the matter came from
 unhone kaha, 'raay kaa puraa intervyuu galat tathyon or juthi baton par aadhaarit tha, jis par hansi aa rahi thi
 What Rai said in the interview is beyond my comprehension
 main iske kaaran bhi nahin soch paa rahaa hum
 Vinod Rai's response has revealed how much he understood this
 'aniruddh ne kaha ki purv sioe adhyaksh kaa bisisiai ke revenue model ko galat tareeke se pesh karnaa durbhagyapurna he or unhone purv sieji se is tarah kii ummid nahin kii thi
 Chaudhary said, 'it is unfortunate that the person who has held the administration of the BCCI for three years is not aware of this trivial matter
 ' choudhary ne kaha ki raay ne is baat ko sunishchit kiya tha ki donon kaa zyada se zyada samay tak koi sampark na ho
 Chaudhary said that Rai used to be confused about issues related to the ICC
 sioe ke aadesh ke baad se unke haath bandhe hue theaniruddh ne kaha, 'raay isisi ko lekar khud main hi uljhe rahete the, kyonki ek taraf vah bisisiai ke garvanence package or financiel package se achoote rahane par dusron par dosha madte the to vahiin duusari taraf vah isisi chairman shashaank manohar kii tarifen kiya karte the or kehete the un donon ke sambandh madhur hai
 Was this not the reason for the relationship that allowed the ICC to treat BCCI badly, as it knew that action would not be overturned by the BCCI
 'unhone kaha, 'yah sabhi jaanate hai ki isisi main girti saakh kaa kaaran manohar the or raay kaa yah bayaan gambhir vivaad paidaa karata he ki unhen shashank ke plan kii jaankaree thi
 Chaudhary explained how his hands were tied since the COA order and how he was following the orders of the Supreme Court
 unhone kaha, 'sioe dwaara jari kiye gaye aadesh ke kaaran main chup rahaa or yah bataata he ki meri aawaaj ko dabaane ke liye vah kis had tak gaye
 i fully accepted the Supreme Court order
