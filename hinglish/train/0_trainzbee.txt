 The BJP has also said that the reason behind the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's return of Rs 5 crore flood relief to Gujarat is still not known and JD U's behavior has hurt bjp's sentiments
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa em venkaiya naidu ne kaha, ‘‘ bhaajapa or jad you acchhee sarkaar chalaane or janata kii seva karne ke icchhuk hai

 a post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan Fanclub (@kareenafc) on Jan 16, 2018 at 5:33am PSTA post shared by Tusshar (@tusshark89) on Jan 14, 2018 at 4:59am PST 42 thousand 503 students who have failed in the twenty-seventh class of Delhi government schools have got a big relief from the High Court
 dillihoicourt ne fatkaar lagaate hue dilli sarkaar ko kaha he ki fail hue 10veen ke chaatro ko aap apane hi sarkari skulon se kaise nikaal sakate hai
 The angry court itself told the Delhi government that the failed students are one thousand or ten thousand, 40 thousand or one lakh, you will have to give them admission again
 darasal, dilli ke sarkari skulon main dasvin kaksha main fail hue chaatr chaatraon ko skulon ne apana rigelt behatar karne ke liye skool se hi baahar kar diya tha
 The students who were expelled moved the High Court and while hearing their case in the High Court today, scolded the Delhi government and said that the children who are expelled from the government schools will finally study
 dilli hoicourt kaa sawaal jaij tha kyonki zyaadaatar garib pariwaron ke vah bachche sarkari skulon main shiksha le rahe hai jinke paas fees ke paise dene ke liye bhi nahin he
 So if their names have been cut off from government schools, then these poor children have no means to maintain their education further
 iske alaava dilli sarkaar kii skool niti bhi saaf taur par kahati he ki agar koi baccha kamjor he yaa fail hua he to use skool se nikaala nahin jayega
 But the government schools run by the Delhi government are themselves flouting the Delhi Education Act
 lekin dilli sarkaar ke sarkari skulon se hui bhul ko hai court ne thik karne kaa faisla jarur kar liya he
 During the hearing on Friday, the Delhi High Court said that the Advocates of the Delhi Government should either bring an instruction from the Government till Tuesday or August 28 that the Delhi Government is giving admission again to the failed students in the government schools, or we will pass the order
 That again, more than 40 thousand students who failed in their 10th class should be admitted to the government school again
 dilli hai court 28 agast ko dobaaraa sunwaayee hogi
 Not till today, when Haichaort came to talk to these children, he looked very happy
 khaastaur se hoicourt pahunchi takreeban ek darjan ladakiyon ne kaha ki unki saans ataki hui thi ki vah ab aage padhai kar paaengi yaa nahin lekin aaj hoicourt kii sunwaayee ke baad unhen ummid jaagi he ki vah padhai aage jari rakh paaengi
 Delhi, watching the Ramlila of the high-tech phase, has ever seen that phase of hindu-muslim brotherhood, when the burning Ravana fell after burning on the day of Dussehra, the Muslim youth pulled out the burning bullets of his feet and ran towards his locality
 Were
 un dinon mohalle main ravan kii ‘jalati taang’ laana shagun mana jaataa tha
 Drinking memories, Anees Azmi, secretary of Urdu Academy, said, 'the period was of our Eid and our Diwali
 ramlila hamaara pasandida aayojan tha
 In those days, at least 10 percent of the participation in Ramlila was of Muslims and about 10 percent of Hindus in Urs at the Dargah of Hazrat Nizamuddin
 ham sab milakar ravan banaate the or ramlila utsav main bhaag lete the
 He told, 'my house was near Ramlila Maidan
 yahaan sabase bada ravan jalataa tha
 When Ravana fell after Dahan, i and my companions used to run towards his locality with the burning bulls of his feet
 balliyon se chingaariyaan nikalati rahati thi or unhen haathon main pakadakar ham do sau se teen sau gaj bhaagate the
 The locals used to be happy and said, 'ravana's leg came in our neighborhood
 ’ ise acha shagun mana jaataa tha
 'now people may have forgotten this tradition and today even the security guards do not let go
 sab kuch badal gaya he
 He said that it is true that there is no longer a trend to bring Ravana into the 'burning leg' locality and the changing times have come to dominate it
 varsh 1924 se ramlila kar rahi shridharmik ramlila samiti ke adhyaksh vishwanath gupta (70) kehete he, ‘kai peediyaan guzar gai
 i heard from my father that first this Ramlila takes place in Bhagirath Palace, then Gandhi Maidan, then Parade Ground and now Ramlila Ground near Lal Qila
 pehle mathura ke kalakaar aate the
 Now the locals work
 hamaari koshish rahati he ki takanic kaa istemaal kam ho
 Our emphasis is more on the original Ramayana
 ’varsh 1969 se shuruuaat kar 40 saal kaa safar puraa kar chuki luvkush ramlila samiti ke sansthaapak ajarun kumaar kehete he, ‘ab darshak takanic dekhnaa chaahate he
 They like Dimmer Light, Echo Mike, the screaming sword, Ravana, who arrows in the navel and fumes from both eyes
 ’vah kehete he, ‘160 se adhik deshon main pehali baar hamaari ramlila kaa sidhaa prasaaran ho rahaa he or yah mobile phone par bhi uplabdh he
 We are sending two and a half million emails to attract the youth towards Ramayana
 fasebuk par hamaare 1800 sadsy hai
 "ravana's height depends on the budget," says Jathedar Avtar Singh, General Secretary of the 'new Youth Ramlila Committee' of Shri Ram Vatika of Kashmiri Gate
 1972 main jab hamane yah samiti banaai thi, tab hamaara bajet 90 rupaye tha, jo aaj lakhon main jaataa he
 This time we will also have effigy of corruption along with Ravana
 ’vah kehete hai, ‘pehle or aaj kii soch main jameen aasmaan kaa antar he
 Today everything comes after professionalism
 aatmavishvaas kii jaden gahari hai, lekin hamaari viraasat to hame hi sahejni chahie
 In our Ramlila, Ram is playing the role of a Hindu youth and Ram is playing the role of a Muslim youth

 58 thousand Shikshamitras to be appointed in UP: a vacation bench of Justices Adarsh kumar Goel and UU Lalit said that we will not disturb the recruitment of teachers appointed by the court
 iskaa matlab he ki 72,825 shikshak bhartee main niyukt hue shikshakon ko koi pareshaani nahin hogi
 The court has said on behalf of NCTE that it is the right of the state government to give weightage

 lalit modi kii madad ko lekar ek ke baad ek aa rahe khulaason se sarkaar par dabaav badhata ja rahaa he
 On Wednesday, Communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad defended Sushma Swaraj, but he could not stand openly with Vasundhara Raje Scindia
 ravishankar prasad ne kaha, "videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne jo kuch bhi kiya maanviya aadhaar par kiya or ise kisi bhi paristhiti main galat nahin mana ja saktaa he
 " lalit modi ko bachaane ke maamle main jahaan ek taraf sarkaar or party ne ise maanviyata ke aadhaar par liya gaya faisla bataate hue videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj kaa khul kar bachaav kiya he, vahiin vasundhara raaje sindhiya ke khilaaf maamle par sarkaar kii raay alag he
 After the way documents have come out against Scindia, the government has found it difficult to explain in this matter
 jab patrakaron ne ravishankar prasad se vasundhara ke bare main poocha to unhone kaha, "is maamle main mujhe tathyon kii jaankaree leni hogi
 Vasundhara Raje Scindia and her government will explain the matter
 " It is important that the BJP is silent on the way Vasundhara Raje signed Lalit Modi's immigration documents with secrecy
 vaise congress ke hamale jhel rahi bijepi ke liye choti si raahat ye he ki use sushamaa swaraj ke maamle main achaanak sharad pavaar kaa saath mil gaya he
 On Wednesday, Pawar said that the way the matter is being exaggerated in the media, it is being given publicity, they do not agree with it
 pavaar ne daawa kiya ki kisi netaa kii kisi ke saath mulaakaat par bina kisi jaanch-padtaal ke sawaal kaise uthaaya ja saktaa he
 The comments lekin duusare vipakshi dal narendra modi sarkaar or bijepi par sushamaa ke istife ko lekar dabaav banaae hue hai
 JD-U national president Sharad Yadav said that Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj should resign after the manner in which allegations are constantly being made in this case
 mushkil yah he ki ek ke baad ek jis tarah se lalit modi maamle main nae khulaase ho rahe hai or nae tathy saarvajanik ho rahe hai, uski vajah se ye maamla modi sarkaar ke liye pehla bada or asli raajnneetik sankat banataa dikh rahaa he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said, "whatever External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj did was done on humanitarian grounds and it cannot be considered wrong under any circumstances
 " On the one hand, in the matter of saving Lalit Modi, while the government and the party have openly defended External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, on the basis of humanitarianism, the government has a different opinion on the case against Vasundhara Raje Scindia
 sindhiya ke khilaaf jis tarah se dastavej saamne aaye hai, uske baad sarkaar ko is maamle main safai dena mushkil ho gaya he
 When reporters asked Ravi Shankar Prasad about Vasundhara, he said, "I have to know the facts in this case
 vasundhara raaje sindhiya or unki sarkaar is maamle par safai denge
 " ye mahatvapurn he ki vasundhara raaje ne jis tarah gopneeyata se lalit modi ke avrajan dastavezon par dastakhat kiye, us par bijepi chup he
 By the way, the small relief for the BJP facing the Congress attack is that it has suddenly got Sharad Pawar's support in the case of Sushma Swaraj
 buudhvaar ko pavaar ne kaha ki jis tarah se is maamle ko badha-chadhaakar media main pesh kiya ja rahaa he, ise publicity di ja rahi he wo isse ittefaq nahin rakhte
 Pawar claimed that how a leader's meeting with someone can be questioned without any investigation
 tippaniyan But the other opposition parties are under pressure on the Narendra Modi government and the BJP for Sushma's resignation
 jedy-you ke rashtriya adhyaksh sharad yadav ne kaha ki jis tarah se is maamle main lagaataar aarope lag rahe hai uske baad videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ko istipha de dena chahie
 The problem is that one after the other, new revelations are being made in the Lalit Modi case and new facts are becoming public, due to which this case seems to be the first major and real political crisis for the Modi government
 lalit modi ko bachaane ke maamle main jahaan ek taraf sarkaar or party ne ise maanviyata ke aadhaar par liya gaya faisla bataate hue videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj kaa khul kar bachaav kiya he, vahiin vasundhara raaje sindhiya ke khilaaf maamle par sarkaar kii raay alag he
 After the way documents have come out against Scindia, the government has found it difficult to explain in this matter
 jab patrakaron ne ravishankar prasad se vasundhara ke bare main poocha to unhone kaha, "is maamle main mujhe tathyon kii jaankaree leni hogi
 Vasundhara Raje Scindia and her government will explain the matter
 " It is important that the BJP is silent on the way Vasundhara Raje signed Lalit Modi's immigration documents with secrecy
 vaise congress ke hamale jhel rahi bijepi ke liye choti si raahat ye he ki use sushamaa swaraj ke maamle main achaanak sharad pavaar kaa saath mil gaya he
 On Wednesday, Pawar said that the way the matter is being exaggerated in the media, it is being given publicity, they do not agree with it
 pavaar ne daawa kiya ki kisi netaa kii kisi ke saath mulaakaat par bina kisi jaanch-padtaal ke sawaal kaise uthaaya ja saktaa he
 The comments lekin duusare vipakshi dal narendra modi sarkaar or bijepi par sushamaa ke istife ko lekar dabaav banaae hue hai
 JD-U national president Sharad Yadav said that Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj should resign after the manner in which allegations are constantly being made in this case
 mushkil yah he ki ek ke baad ek jis tarah se lalit modi maamle main nae khulaase ho rahe hai or nae tathy saarvajanik ho rahe hai, uski vajah se ye maamla modi sarkaar ke liye pehla bada or asli raajnneetik sankat banataa dikh rahaa he
 When reporters asked Ravi Shankar Prasad about Vasundhara, he said, "I have to know the facts in this case
 vasundhara raaje sindhiya or unki sarkaar is maamle par safai denge
 " ye mahatvapurn he ki vasundhara raaje ne jis tarah gopneeyata se lalit modi ke avrajan dastavezon par dastakhat kiye, us par bijepi chup he
 By the way, the small relief for the BJP facing the Congress attack is that it has suddenly got Sharad Pawar's support in the case of Sushma Swaraj
 buudhvaar ko pavaar ne kaha ki jis tarah se is maamle ko badha-chadhaakar media main pesh kiya ja rahaa he, ise publicity di ja rahi he wo isse ittefaq nahin rakhte
 Pawar claimed that how a leader's meeting with someone can be questioned without any investigation
 tippaniyan But the other opposition parties are under pressure on the Narendra Modi government and the BJP for Sushma's resignation
 jedy-you ke rashtriya adhyaksh sharad yadav ne kaha ki jis tarah se is maamle main lagaataar aarope lag rahe hai uske baad videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ko istipha de dena chahie
 The problem is that one after the other, new revelations are being made in the Lalit Modi case and new facts are becoming public, due to which this case seems to be the first major and real political crisis for the Modi government

 In 2011, Arunima Sinha, a national level volleyball player, was thrown from a moving train by some goons
 asahneeya pidaa main puri raat railway trek par gujaarne vaali arunima ko is ghatana main apana ek pair ganvaana padaa or unke duusare pair main rod lagaai gai
 Due to an accident where life is usually stalled, many people spend four to five years walking with artificial legs, Arunima, as a player, kept the passion inside her for just two years of the incident Mount Everest, the highest place in the world, was conquered
 duniya kii sabase oonchi parvat chotii par chadhaai karne vaali pehali aapng mahila parvatarohi banane kaa unhone itihaas banaaya
 This passion of Arunima is not only the story of a woman climbing the world's highest peak, but the story of her unwavering faith, on which she overcame her biggest weakness by overcoming huge obstacles instead of being forced into the hands of despair
 Dare to build strength
 apane dard ko peeche chhodte hue arunima ne apana safar keval mount everest kii chadhaai tak hi simit nahin rakhaa, balki iske badhvibhinn mahadwipon ke pandanya shikharon kii bhi chadhaai kii
 Their goal now is to make the most difficult challenge by waving the Indian flag on the Everest Vinson Massif, the highest peak in Antarctica
 arunima bagal ke trek se guzar rahi train se takaraa gayi or phir jameen par gir gayi
 What happened next, they do not remember anything
 unhen keval itnaa yaad he ki hosh aane ke baad unhen asahneeya dard kaa ahsaas hua or iskaa bhi ahsaas hua ki vah apana ek pair kho chuki hai or duusare par gambhir chot lagi he
 He said, "I was screaming for help, but there was no one around who could help me
" chuuhe mere ghayal pair ko kutar rahe the or sari raat main dard se karaahati rahi
 i counted 49 trains passed by me
 "subah kuch gaanv waalon ne arunima ko dekha or unhen paas ke aspataal main lekar gaye, jahaan chikitsakon ko unke ek pair ko kaatna padaa or duusare pair main rod lagaai
 Arunima said, "he did not have an anesthesia and i told him to heal my injured leg without giving me an anesthesia
" maine puraa raat asahneeya dard ko jhela tha or isliye main jaanati thi ki main thik hone ke liye kuch or dard sah sakati hum
 "subsequently, Arunima was transferred to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, where she was admitted for about four months
 yaheen par unhone sankalp liya ki vah mount everest par chadhaai karengi
 Arunima said, "when i recovered a bit, i heard rumors circulating in the media
 isamen kaha ja rahaa tha ki mere paas train kaa tikat nahin tha or isliye, main train se kud gai
 When this proved wrong, it was said that i had jumped from the train to commit suicide
 "unhone kaha, "main or meraa parivaar puure jor se pratwaad kar rahaa tha ki ye sab jhooth he, lekin kisi ne hamaari baat nahin suni
 Therefore, i chose the best way to respond to all those people
 maine faisla kiya ki main sabit kar duungi ki durghatana se pehle main kya thi or ab main kya hum
 "the condition in which Arunima was after the accident is difficult to move
 lekin, asaadhaaran iraadon vaali arunima kii kahani kabhi dhairya na haarane vaale jazbe kii kahani sabit hui
 While the whole world was skeptical of his intentions, his family and especially his brother-in-law Om Prakash encouraged him
 42 saal ke om prakaash ne arunima ko unke lakshya kii ore prerit karne ke liye apni kendriya rigerv police bal (siarpief) kii naukari se tyaagptr de diya
 In the circumstances where Arunima was, it takes years for people to stand up, while Arunima got up in only four months
 agle do saal unhone everest par chadhaai karne vaali pehali bhartiya mahila bachhendri paal se prashikshan liya
 They got sponsors, their journey started and then the day also came when the floor was destroyed
 arunima ne kaha ki iskoshish ke dauraan unke pairon se khun bahata rahata thaor aksar vah gir bhi jaati thim
 People called her crazy and she felt that she would never succeed in her goal
 haalanki, ve sabhi unke iraadon kii majbootee se anjaan the
 He said, "people formed their opinion on seeing my physical weakness, but did not see the passion inside me
 kisi kii parvaah kiye bagaiyr maine apane aapako samajhaayaa ki main chal sakati hum
 My helpless feet also understood this
 "arunima ne apane kritrim pair ke dam par ab tak mount everest ke alaava, mount kilimanjaro (africa), mount kojosco (austrailia), mount akonkagua (dakshin america), karstenj pyramid (indonesia) or mount elbras (europe) kii chadhaai kar lee he
 Arunima will train in Ladakh before climbing 'everest: Vinson Massif' in Antarctica
 unhone kaha, "main disambar main vinson masif kii chadhaai ke liye antarctic ja rahi hum
 It is the seventh peak and also the most difficult after Everest
 "arunima duniya ko sirf yah bataanaa chaahati hai ki agar koi shaks lakshya hasil karne kii thaan le, to koi baadha use nahin roak sakati
 He said, "when i reached the summit of Everest, i wanted to scream and tell the world that, look, i am at the top of the world while no one believed that i could do it
" "arunima kii ichha viklang logon ke liye ek antarrashtriya khel academy kii sthapana karne kii he
 He said, "for this, i have bought land in Unnao near Kanpur
 bhawan banane kii jarurat he jisapar 55 karod kharch honge
 But, it would not be more difficult than climbing Mount Everest with one foot
 "arunima ne lakhanu main 120 viklang bacchon ko god liya he or har sambhav tareeke se unki madad kar rahi hai
 What is the level of a college, its biggest identity is from how the teachers are teaching there
 lekin aise collejon ke bare main aap kya kahenge jahaan teacher hai hi nahin or padhai bhagwaan bharose ho
 It sounds astonishing to hear, but there are hundreds of government engineering colleges in the country, where many posts of teachers have been vacant for many years
 60 fisadi tak pad hai khaleeiski vajah yah he ki ye college aisi jagahon par hai jahaan jaakar padhaane ke liye yogya shikshak khojane se bhi nahin milte
 Most of these colleges are in backward states like Jharkhand, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and North East states
 kuch college to aise hai jahaan shikshakon ke 60 fisadi tak pad kai saalon se khaali chal rahe hai
 The fate of 53 government engineering colleges will shine
 Now the luck of about one lakh students studying in such 53 government engineering colleges is going to shine
 ab gaya, mujffarpur, ramgarh, hazaribagh, kalahandi or dumka ke sarkari ejineering collejon ko iaiti or enaiti se piechdi karne vaale teacher milenge
 There are 1225 people ready to teach in remote areas, because the Central Government has implemented a new scheme to improve the standard of institutions of higher technical education
 is yojana ke tahat iits, nits, iisers or iiits se paas hokar nikalne vaale aise 1225 logon ko chunaa gaya he jo teen saal ke liye aise dur-daraaj ke pichhade ilaakon main jaakar sarkari ejineering kalejon main padhaane ke liye taiyaar hai
 They will get a salary of Rs 70,000 per month
 ye sabhi college rajya sarkaron ke hai, lekin in teacheron ke par kendra sarkaar teen saal main 375 crores rupaye kharch karegi
 The Minister said that the people serving the country, Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar, while talking about this, said that many of these 1225 people are those who have higher degrees like phd from iits
 unhone kaha ki in logon ko kahin zyada kamai vaali naukari mil sakati thi, lekin inhone desh kii seva karne ke liye ye jimmedaari chuni
 It can also be a compulsion, however, how much truth is there in their claims, it is difficult to say
 kahin aisa to nahin ki naukari kaa bazaar thanda hone se log majaburi main choti jagahon par jaakar 70,000 rupee maheene kii naukari karne ko taiyaar ho gaye hai, vah bhi teen saal ke kantrect par
 This question arises because Prakash Javadekar himself said that about 5000 people had applied for the posts of 1225 teachers from these higher education institutions

 safed chole main satsang karne vaale asaram ko to puri duniya jaanati he lekin is libaas ke peeche chhipe asli asaram se kam hi waakif hai
 This Asaram is fond of bonding with girls, Asaram makes his enemy hide, he does Asaram Ayyashi and he sexually exploits disciples in the name of Asaram's solitude
 ye ham nahin kah rahe, balki ye kahana he asaram ke saath lanbaa vakt guzaar chuke khud unheen ke saadhakon kaa, jinhone apni ankhon se asaram kaa wo sach dekha he, jise dekhne ke baad ab unki jameer unhen khamosh rahane se roak rahi he
 In other words, Asaram has many faces, not one
 asaram ke in chehron se ek-ek kar nakaab hattle vaala he
 Asaram sits on the pulpit, preaching
 duniya ko sadachaar or brahmacharya kaa sikh detaa he or apni aadhyatmik shaktiyon or dawaaon se unki dukh takaleef dur karne kaa daawa karata he
 Obviously, this is the face of Asaram, due to which millions of people in the world are drawn towards Asaram, but if those who know Asaram are close to him, then the face of Asaram is less, but more of a mask, the real Asaram is someone else
 duniya kii najaron se dur hote hi ye asaram apni asaliyat par utar aata he
 Sitting from the Vyaspeeth, his eyes revolve in search of the girls, that then he comes to the solitary confinement
 is asaram ko naa sirf ladakiyon ke saath rishte banane kii chahat rahati he, balki wo choti or maasoom ladakiyon ko hameshaa apane kareeb laane kii koshish main laga rahata he or kai baar wo ladakiyon ke saath swimming pul main nahaane kaa mazaa bhi letaa he or unheen se apni maalish bhi karwaata he
 This face of Asaram is not of a saint, but of Satan
 ye vyasapeeth se neeche utarate hi kisi criminal kii tarah jeene lagata he
 He abuses and also makes people who speak out against him have a place
 alag-alag hatkandon se rupee kamanaa or mauka milte hi ladakiyon ke kareeb aane kii koshish karnaa hi is asaram kaa sabase pasandida shagal he or asaram ke ashram main andhashraddha ke maare saikadon log, ye sabakuch ankhen moond kar dekhte rahete hai
 Now the old people who are aware of the real Asaram have started coming forward to help the law against Asaram
 jaahir he, asaram kii musiibat abhi khatm nahin hone vaali hai
 On the other hand, due to the drama, drama and gimmick, Asaram's son Narayan Sai kept throwing dust in the eyes of the world for a long time, but now what his old serviceman has revealed about him is not only shocking but embarrassing
 is sevadaar kii maane to narayan naa sirf apni pita kii tarah ekantavaas ke naam par ladakiyon kaa yon shoshan karte the, balki ashramon main ekantavaas kii kutiyaa kii dizine bhi khaas taur par yon shoshan ke iraade se taiyaar kii jaati thi
 The topper hut was away from the crowd, they had not one, but two gates at the top, so that no one could see Narayan Sai or Asaram coming in or out of the hut together with the girl and in need
 Accordingly, other doors can be used
 narayan ladakiyon ko lekar ekantavaas kii kutiyaa tak jate or jab ladki ke saath vakt bitaa kar unka man bhar jaataa tha, to kutiyaa se baahar nikal kar code language kaa istemaal kar apane sevadaar ko cameraa saaf kar dene ke liye kehete
 Actually, cleaning this room did not mean cleaning, but the girl had to be taken out of the room
 narayan sai ke purv sevadaar mahendra chawla kaa kahana he ki pehle to wo asaram or narayan sai ke bhakt hua karte the, lekin jab unhone donon kii sachai apni ankhon se dekhi, to phir unhen aisa sadma laga ki wo depressant main rahane lage or isse nikalne main bhi unhen saalon kaa vakt lag gaya
 According to this former seeker, Asaram's trust is not a place of religion, but a place of crime and racketeering, where the only motive is to earn more money and money with girls
 asaram or narayan sai logon se milanevaale paison byaaj par lagaate hai or agar koi in paison ko vakt par dene main naakaam rahata he yaa anakani karata he to police or gundon kii madad se unase vasuuli kii jaati he
 Chawla says that he had complained not only to Gujarat but also to Haryana Police in connection with the misdeeds of the father-son, but each time his complaint was put on hold and in his statement before the DK Trivedi Commission of Gujarat He had also told about the wrong business going on in the ashram, but then the Commission officials ignored his talk
 ab ek ke baad ek balaatkaar ke ilzaamon main ghirne ke baad narayan sai jis tarah police se bhaagate phir rahe hai, use dekh kar to yahi lagata he ki jahaan dhuaan hota he, aag bhi jarur hoti he
 Right now the attention of the country was not removed from the constant firing and martyrdom of the soldiers
 ab guuruuvaar subah pathankot main do sandigdh bag paye gayi hai
 These bags are found near Maimoon Cantt
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki yah bag military aria se lagbhag 200 meter kii duuri par the
 It is being told that both bags were black
 aapako bataa den ki pichley kuch dinon se lagaataar bharat-paak border par firing ho rahi he
 Let us tell you that a suspected Scorpio was recovered in Pathankot and Gurdaspurilake on Tuesday
 police adhikari ne bataaya ki is scorpiyo ke paas lagbhag 6 sandigdh log dekhe gayi the
 The attack took place last year, let us tell you that on January 2 last year, at 3:30 in the morning, Pathankot Airforce station in Pathankot, Punjab, was attacked by heavy weapons equipped with real ammo
 aatankiyon se muthbhed main 7 jawan shahid ho gaye the or 37 log ghayal ho gaye the
 All the attacking terrorists were also killed
 lekin is hamale ke ek saal baad bhi yah pukhta taur par nahin kaha ja saktaa ki hamaara desh paak pryojit aatankwaad se apana bachaav karne main sakasham he
 Seven soldiers were martyred In the terrorist attack on the airbase station, a total of seven soldiers were martyred
 desh ke liye praanon kii aahuti dene waalon main leftinent karnal niranjan pi kumaar (kerala) , soobedaar fateh sih (gurdaspur), hawaldaar kulvant sih (gurdaspur), consteble jagadish singh (himachal pradesh), consteble sanjivan kumaar (sihuaan), consteble gursevak sih (haryana), tathaa mulraj (jammu-kashmir) shaamil the
 Expressing confidence of the UPA forming the government again, Rahul Gandhi insisted that the 'balloon' of the bjp's propaganda would explode like the 'india Shining' of 2004
 saath hi aagaah kiya ki narendra modi kaa satta main aana desh ke liye nuksaandaayak hoga
 Along with Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Rahul cautioned that Modi's ideology is against the idea of india and that the Congress will fight with full commitment to ensure that this ideology is defeated
 party kaa ghoshnaptr jari karte hue unhone opinian pole ko tavajjo nahin di, jinamein aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon main upie ke kharaab pradarshan kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya he
 He said that when the election results are out, everyone will be surprised
 endie ke jabardast prachaar ke bare main rahul ne kaha ki 'india shining' kaa gubbaaraa jaise fata tha, main daawey se kah saktaa hum ki yah gubbaaraa bhi usee tarah fatega
 He said that this will happen especially in Uttar Pradesh, where 80 seats are at stake
 rahul ne kaha ki 'india shining' jaise prachaar ko aage badhaane kii bijepi main kshamta he, lekin sabko dhyaan rakhana chahie ki 2004 ke nattejey jab saamne aae, vah prachaar gaayab ho gaya
 Targeting bjp's prime ministerial candidate Modi, Rahul said that he is not personally opposed to Modi, but he is against his ideology, which is against the idea of india
 aam aadmi party kii chandani chowk vidhayak alka lamba ab philhal congress main nahin ja rahi hai
 She will remain in the Aam Aadmi Party
 philhal aam aadmi party or alka lamba ke bich chal rahaa vivaad sulajh gaya he
 Giving information about this, Alka Lamba himself said that the 'good news' has been added to all the groups again by AAP, meetings have also started coming up, from Monday i am going to campaign for AAP candidate of Chandni Chowk Lok Sabha
 sab thik karne kaa aashwaasan diya gaya'
 Let us tell you that in December 2018, a dispute started between Alka Lamba and Aam Aadmi Party
 darasal, 1984 sikh virdohi hinsa maamle main bhootpurv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi se bharat ratna waapas liya jaae aisa ek prastaav dilli vidhansabha main paas ho gaya tha
 Aam Aadmi Party sources said that Alka Lamba made some changes to Somnath Bharti in the original proposal (the original proposal did not mention the withdrawal of Bharat Ratna from Rajiv Gandhi), which led to the party's disgrace while Alka Lamba said that she Rajiv Gandhi refused to support the proposal to withdraw the Bharat Ratna and left the House of Assembly, while the party gave him this proposal Receive support was saying
 iske baad se alakalamba koam aadmi party ke sabhi whatsap group se hataa diya gaya tha or unhemparty kii kisi baithak main nahin bulaayaa ja rahaa tha
 Even when Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal held a public meeting last month at Chandni Chowk Assembly constituency, from where Alka Lamba is an MLA, local MLA Alka Lamba was not invited
 party ke aise rukh ke chalate alka lamba congress main jane ko taiyaar thim
 Last week, PC Chacko, in charge of Delhi Congress, said that he would be happy if Alka Lamba comes to the Congress because Alka Lamba has been in the Congress before
 jiske jawaab main alka namaa ne kaha tha ki unhen congress se koi prastaav nahin mila he lekin agar aisa koi prastaav miltaa he to mere liye sammaan kii baat hogi kyonki maine congress party ko apane jivan ke 20 saal die hai
 After this, Aam Aadmi Party's chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj had said that if Alka Lamba leaves the Aam Aadmi Party and goes to Congress, then he will have to resign from the post of MLA
 kul milakar alka lamba or aam aadmi party main vivaad bahut bad gaya tha or yah lagbhag tay mana ja rahaa tha ki alka lamba kabhi bhi congress main ja sakati hai kyonki vah pehle bhi congress main hi thim,lekin ab vivaad philhal sulajhata dikh rahaa he
 Perhaps the Aam Aadmi Party has understood that if their mlas leave the party during the Lok Sabha elections, these will not be considered good signs for the party
 saath hi pichley kuch samay main aam aadmi party ke kaineta yaa to party chhod diyea phir nikaale gaye
 If this trend continues like this, the negativity for the party will increase
 isliye aam aadmi party ne philhal is vivaad ko sulajhaa kar ek sankat ko taalane kii koshish kii he

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne rafel ladaaku vimaanon kii deal kaa istemaal shuukravaar ko sansad main modi sarkaar par aaropon kii barsaat ke liye kiya
 Rahul was speaking in the Lok Sabha during the discussion on 'no confidence motion'
 rahul gandhi kaa aarope : raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne ‘jhooth’ bolaa ki france ke saath ladaaku vimaan ke liye 2016 kaa samjhauta france or bharat ke bich dwipaksheeya gopneeyata kii shart se bandhaa tha
 The Congress President insisted that French President Emanuel Macron himself denied that the above contract was bound by any condition of confidentiality
 rahul gandhi sansad main kaha, ‘main france ke raashtrapati se nijee taur par mila tha
 i asked him if there was any secret pact between India and France, then the President of France denied having a secret pact between the two countries
 ’rafel sambandhi reports ke fact chack se pataa chalata he ki sarkaar or vipaksh, donon is mudde par ‘kabhi kuch to kabhi kuch’ vaala ravaiya dikhaate rahe
 Explain that India had originally ordered the Dassault Company of France to contract 126 fighter jets in 2012
 chaar saal baad modi sarkaar ne deal kaa elaan kiya to ladaaku jet kii sankhya ghataakar 36 kar di gai
 The date-wise accounting of information related to Rafale is as follows
 
 
 
 
 17 november, 2017is taarikh koraksha mantri nirmala sitaramanne news conference main jaankaree saajha karne kaa vaada kiya
 Sitharaman told the media, 'the deal was finalized with a transparent process
 ’ reportron ne jab baar-baar raksha mantri se poocha ki upie sarkaar ke vakt prayek vimaan kii kitni keemat par sahmati bani thi or pichley saal deal ko manjuur karte hue kis keemat par baat bani to raksha mantri ne adhikariyon ko media ko deal se jude aankaden uplabdh karaane ke liye kaha
 February 5, 2018: a week before French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to New Delhi, Defense Minister Sitharaman refused to share Rafael's details
 unhone antar-sarkaar soochna ke tahat ditels ko ‘gopneey soochna’ bataaya
 The Defense Minister gave this answer in response to the question of Samajwadi Party MP Naresh Aggarwal
 agarwal ne jaananaa chaha tha ki kya sarkaar deal ko saarvajanik domen se dur rakhana chaahati he
 March 8, 2018: India Today publishes the interview given by President Macron to Editorial Director Raj Chengappa
 france ke raashtrapati ne deal se jude vanijyik pahaluon kii jaankaree dene se inkaar kiya tha
 Why can't the information of the Raj Chengappa-deal be disclosed so that the situation is clear and the allegations can stop airing? President Macron — Firstly, if you make such commercial agreements, then obviously you have competitors
 isliye deal kii ditels un tak ham nahin pahunchane de sakate
 In India and France, while the deal is very sensitive, we cannot open details for business reasons
 duusari baat, bharat sarkaar kii ore se kuch vichaar vimarsh yojit kiye gaye, or ye unhen sochna he ki apni sansad or vipaksh ke saath koun si jaankaree ko saajha karnaa he
 i am not the one who interrupts such a discussion
 aapako ye samajhnaa chahie ki hamen vanijyik samvedansheeltaaon ko bhi dekhnaa hota he
 March 12, 2018: Rahul Gandhi tweeted about his meeting with Macron
 “kal, main france ke raashtrapati maikron se mila
 We looked at various common issues related to our liberal democracies
 phek news kaa mudda bhi uthaa
 Rahul also shared a picture of former PM Manmohan Singh and the French President on his Twitter handle
 28 march, 2018:raksha rajya mantri subhash bamare ne sansad ko bataaya ki gopneey data ko sangrakshit rakhane ke liye ek samjhauta bharat or france ke bich 10 march, 2018 ko ek samjhauta hua

 This confirms that the allies are not the wants of the Congress, but the necessity
 2004 main congress party kii niti main aitihaasik badlaav dekha gaya jab congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi lok janashakti party ke mukhiya ramvilas paswan se milane unke ghar pahunch gai thi
 This move tried to show that the Congress has accepted coalition politics wholeheartedly by removing its psychological hurdles
 iske baad ek gathbandhan taiyaar hua
 But after eight years, the Congress has started working on its strategy once again
 congress main jab rahul kaa prabhaav to badha to 2009 tak gathbandhan dharm kii baat karne vaali congress upi main vaapasi ke liye apane sahyogiyon ke khilaaf hi takat kaa pradarshan karti hui dikhi
 With this competition, the 'ekla Chalo Re' project got a boost in the Congress
 congress kii is niti ke sabase pehle shikaar bane lalu prasad yadav
 Then, during the 2012 assembly elections, the Samajwadi Party tasted the arrogant nature of the Congress

 But inside, the gap between them is widening

 Today no party is capable of playing the role of 'bigg Boss'
 ve kehete hai ki, 'rahul ke is video se unki party khush to nahin he magar maharashtra main unhen sarkaar chalaani he
 Given the upcoming general election, the Congress is once again in a state of confusion
 bahut had tak yahi sthiti bijepi kii bhi he
 Both parties are determined to start the electoral battle with their original allies
 abhi ve sahyogi dal jutaney kii res karne ke mood main nahin dikh rahe hai
 Some Congress leaders believe that everything depends on the performance of the party and hoped that more Congress allies will gather than BJP

 Both parties aim to win 272 seats

 JDU leader KC Tyagi says that what will be the role of JDU in Delhi after the 2014 elections, it is difficult to say

 According to the Congress sources, due to the AIADMK-BJP alliance, the Congress may be reunited with the DMK once again
 yaheen formula lalu-nitish kii party or sapa-basapa par lagu hoga
 Only Congress has to be elected
 congress ke liye modi se behatar or koi sabit nahin ho saktaa he
 The Biju Janata Dal is also not happy about Modi

 Therefore, the correct mantra of 272 figures will be known only after the election

 At the exit of Etawah railway station, there is a famous tea shop named Ghoda Chai
 chaay kii keemat 11 rupye he
 Its owner is 65 years old Anil Kumar Gupta
 unki chaay or tevar donon itawa main mashhoor hai
 When asked why the shop is named Horse Chai, he laughs and says that when he started making tea in 1994, he thought that there is a difference between a donkey and a horse
 usee tarah unki chaay ghoda banakar itawa main naam kamaane kii daud main aage rahegi nateeja aapke saamne hai
 Pointing to the boiling milk in the pot, it is said that people buy milk for Rs 40 a liter, i take milk for Rs 55
 phir kehete he ki koun shaks he jisane hamaari ghoda chhap chaay na pi ho
 i also took a sip of tea in Kulhar and asked how it is possible that the tea shop where there is so much crowd does not have an electoral discussion
 anil kumaar gupta bole ki wo khud loksabhaa chunaav lard chuke hai or bharat main nakli chunaav ke naam se ek kitaab bhi likh chuke hai
 Not only did he revolutionize the tea drinking in Etawah, but when he rebelled against the government during the Emergency in 1975, he was imprisoned by imposing 33 clauses
 ab anil kumaar gupta loktantr senaanee ke taur par jane jate hai or chaay kii kettle dhimi aanch par rakhte hue wo garv se bataate hai ki sapa sarkaar kii shuru kii gai senaanee pension ke bees hajaar rupee bhi har maheene milti he
 Two men drinking tea horse horse are talking about BJP candidate Ramshankar Katheria

 Etawah has been known as a stronghold of the Samajwadi Party
 lekin pichhali baar bijepi ke ashok dohare ne yahaan se jeet hasil kii thi
 This time the BJP has fought Ramshankar Katheria from here by cutting his ticket
 shaam jaise-jaise gadhi ho rahi he chunavi baton kaa silsilaa aage badhata he
 a young man with a yellow hole in his throat says that Ramshankar has been an activist of the Katheria Sangh and has done a lot to connect the Katheria community in Etawah with the BJP
 unheen ke bagal main khadaa ek aadmi jor se chillaaya 'lekin jitegaa gathbandhan hi
 'I asked how he spoke
 
 
 bhai sahab baat samajho, mulaayam singh kaa khandaan yahaan se raajnneeti karata he
 Every fourth man in Etawah is connected to this family in some way
 koi unke chachaa se koi, unke bhai ke ladke se, kisi na kisi tarah unke parivaar se log jude hai or madad lete rahete hai
 Therefore, one cannot get Mulayam's nose cut by defeating the alliance
 gathbandhan or bijepi kii charchaa tikhi ho rahi he
 But in this tough discussion, BJP MP Ashok is missing on double Congress ticket and Shivpal's progressive SP candidate
 chaay pi rahe logon ne bataaya ki bijepi or gathbandhan ke ummidavaaron kii jeet or haar kaa antar kam rahegaa aise main congress or shivpal yadav ke ummidavaar kis party ko zyada nuksaan pahunchaate hai is par bhi jeet haar kaa daaromadar tikaa he
 My tea was over, but the electoral discussion continues here until the horse tea shop is closed

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Bolangir in Odisha came under controversy over the felling of trees for the construction of temporary helipads
 kuch media reports ke mutabik railway kii zamin par heliped ke nirmaan ke liye kareeb 3000 pedo ko gira diya gaya
 Although officials of the Forest Department have said to investigate, but the Railways have rejected such claims outright
 india today fact check ne paaya ki daawa puri tarah sach nahin he
 Some trees and plants were removed for the construction of helipeds
 lagbhag sabhi pramukh samachaarpatron or websites jaise ki ‘da indian express’,‘da hindu’,‘da wyk’or‘kalinga tivi’ne daawa kiya he ki saikadon se lekar hazaron ped heliped banane ke liye kaat die gaye
 'opindia' claimed that all such reports are false
 is website nejutha daawa kiyaaki india today ke flagship ‘india times’ ne da hindu ke aadhaar par khabar ko report kiya he
 Here we would like to mention that the first thing is that India Today has nothing to do with India Times
 duusari baat ye ki india today ne is mudde ko kabhi report nahin kiya
 India Today independently tried to verify the facts behind the allegations of large number of tree felling
 hamane bolnagir ke diviginal forest officer samir satpathi se sampark kiya
 He said, "some trees were dropped near the railway station ground for the construction of a helipad without permission for Modi's visit
" ”satpathi ke mutabik is maamle main jaanch ke aadesh die gaye hai
 Satpathy says that in 2016, 3,500 saplings were planted here under the Urban Plantation Program
 hamaare sthaneey samvaadadaata sufiyaan ne kshetra ke kuch photo bheje
 In these photos, only a few plants can be seen uprooted and the trunk of trees fell on the ground near the helipad
 india today fact check ne east coast railway ke varisht adhikariyon se sampark kiya to unhone hajaaron ped kaate jane ke daavon ko khaarij kiya
 According to the preliminary investigation report of the railway, no more than 40 bushes and plants were removed
 report ke mutabik kaarykram kii taiyaariyon ke tahat railway kii zamin par chah pedo par kulhadi chalaai gai or kuch kii chhatai kii gai
 India Today contacted Suraj Tripathi, who runs a shop near Bolangir railway station, to find out the status of plants and greenery at a particular place which came under question
 treepathi ne hamen jaanch main sahyog kaa bharosa diya or maukey par pahunche
 They sent us their geolocation available via Google Maps
 google arth kii madad se hamane satellite tasviir kii vaastavik lokation ko pahachaanaa
 a photo of the particular place taken in late November 2018 shows that even a month ago, it was empty
 is tarah satellite tasviir ne aise daavon ko khaarij kiya ki us kshetra main hajaaron ped maujuud the
 Counting trees can be seen there in the picture
 india today fact check ne ye sabit kiya ki hajaaron ped kaate jane sambandhi kuch media sansthaanon kaa daawa sachcha nahin he
 In fact only a few counting trees were cut down and some plants were uprooted
 nasik main teesraa shahi snaan chal rahaa he
 Saints and saints are taking a dip in the holy river with full devotion
 nasik ke ramkund main tisare shahi snaan ke maukey par bheed dekhi ja rahi he
 Bathing of the akhadas of sages continues
 sabase pehle nirvaani akhaade ke saadhuon ne dubkee lagaai
 After the Nirmohi Arena, the Sadhus of the Digambara Arena are taking a bath
 vaishnav akhaade ke snaan ke baad aam log snaan kar paaenge
 There was a dispute between the Nirmohi Akhara and the Digambar Akhara regarding which Akhara should be the royal bath first
 baad main baatcheet se yah masalaa sulajh gaya
 Earlier, around 30 devotees took a dip at the second royal bath
 is baar yah aankada or upar jane kii sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he

 i was thinking that the cleavage discussion is over, but it seems that there is some scope left in it
 apni tain bahes shuru karne se pehle saaf kar duun ki yahaan main vishuddh rup se saundaryashastra or bhashaa kii vividhta ke aas-paas hi doluungaa
 There is no intention here to get caught in the morality or appreciation of rebellious attitude
 baharhaal, anya logon kii tarah mere dimag main bhi yah sawaal kaundha ki iske liye hindi, sanskrit yaa urdu main koi shabd he yaa nahin
 On applying my mind, i thought a word 'ur Sandhi' but it was rejected by friends
 phir mujhe apane college ke jamaane kii yaad ai
 Kaliyasot Dam 14 years ago and Bhopal's Excellence College located in greenery below it
 vahiin hindi department main baithe pro
 Vijay Bahadur Singh appeared
 ve kalidas ke ‘kumaar sambhav’ par baatcheet kar rahe hai
 It is said that while reciting Parvati who is absorbed in penance, Mahakavi explains that after dropping a drop of water from his head, which soft part of the body is moving
 turant sar ko phone lagaaya
 He also turned the pages of Kalidas, but there was some talk about some exposed limb
 sateek shabd kii jarurat mahakavi ko bhi mahasoos nahin hui
 After half an hour Sir's call came again
 is bich unhone agra ke sanskrit santhaan ke nideshak pro
 Consulted Azad Mishra
 mishra ji ko bhi is vishay main purvaprachlit shabd nahin mila
 But he suggested a word
 yah shabd he ‘kuch sandhi
 In Sanskrit there is also a synonym of breast
 mujhe to shabd jamaa lekin is aadhe ghante main main apane pita shri om prakaash babele or jamiya main praadhyaapak mitra dilip shakya ko phone kar chukaa tha
 Dileep said directly that the technical term will not be found
 phir ve prasadji kii kamayani main utar gaye
 Narrated, 'mildul ajar limb blossoming in the midst of indigo apparel, blossoming as the flower of lightning cloud between the forest
 unka ishaara tha ‘mridul adhkhula ang’ kii ore
 Prasad ji is using it for cleavage
 vaise hardev bahari ke shabdkosh main iske liye ek or banaavati shabd ‘stan madhya’ miltaa he, lekin isamen lavanya nahin he
 India Today's Cultural Editor Shivkesh ji, however, answered my question after a full 24 hours and said that the word Vaksh is sufficient
 haalanki isse bhi mujhe santushti nahin he
 Amidst these discussions, father's call came
 unhone banbhatta kii kadambari se prasang uthaaya
 Here the heroine describes the heart country between the breasts
 lekin yahaan bhi koi ek shabd nahin
 It is very surprising that in the country of Kamasutra, Kalidas, Bihari and Geet Govind, the need of this word is not felt
 kahin aisa to nahin ki bhartiya saundarya bodh apni najaakat ke kaaran paradaa yaa beparda kahkar hi apni baat kehane main sakasham ho or usko clivej jaise sthool shabd kii jarurat hi na padi ho
 By the way, in Bundelkhand, i have heard only the word "anchal" in any context related to the breasts, if more is said to the chest yani parampara main lakshana kii takat tapakati he, ham sirf abhidha ke bharose thode hi hai
 jamaat-ud-dawa, an organization led by Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the Mumbai attack on the lines of the Taliban, has set up a Sharia court to deliver 'smooth and speedy justice'
 jeyudi ne apane mukhyalay jamiya kadasia main sharia adaalat kii sthapana kii he
 The court is headed by Qazi and Khadim is supporting him
 darul kaja sharia ek samanaantar nyaay vyavastha he, jiskaa gathan lahore main ‘sahaj or twarit nyaay’ pradaan karne ke liye kiya gaya he
 According to a copy of the summons of jamat-ud-dawa, 'this is the arbitration court', this organization has been providing justice from private level for the last few months
 sanghathan ke pravaktaa yahaya mujahid ne ‘sharia adaalat’ kaa bachaav kiya he
 He told Dawn News, 'sharia courts are not a parallel system to the country's constitutional courts
 yah madhyasthata adaalat he jo pakshon kii rajamandi se vivaadon par faisla karti he
 The Mujahid further said that disputes are being resolved under Islamic laws and it is not illegal to mediate between the organization surrounded by the dispute

 Because this is a fantasy story from Karan Johar's production
 jiskaa vaastavik jivan se koi lenadena nahin he
 The film's story begins with Rohan (tiger Shroff), a common boy from Dehradun, who falls in love with his girlfriend Mridula (tara Sutaria) with true love
 mridula ek aisi ladki he jo hai socity or bade sapanom ke peeche bhaag rahi he
 She loves to say Rohan since childhood, but in front of dreams she does not take time to forget Rohan

 In the process of becoming a full masala movie, he forgot what the direction of the film will be

 Prior to this, he has made two flop films

 shanivaar ko gajipur main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii raily main apana dal shaamil nahin hoga
 Anupriya Patel, a minister in the Modi government from Apna Dal quota, has returned from Delhi Airport
 apana dal ke alaava is kaarykram main suheldev bhartiya samaaj party bhi hissaa nahin legi
 Both these parties are part of the bjp-led NDA
 bataa den, piem narendra modi shanivaar ko gajipur ja rahe hai
 He will lay the foundation stone of a medical college here
 saath hi maharaja suheldev par dak tikat jari karenge
 After this, PM Modi will address the public meeting at RTI ground
 modi ke is kaarykram kaa upi kii bijepi sarkaar main mantri or suheldev bhartiya samaaj party ke adhyaksh om prakaash rajbhar virodh kar rahe hai
 He says that the full name of Maharaja Suheldev Rajbhar is not inscribed on the postage stamp
 yah unka apmaan he
 Saying this, he too has distanced himself from PM Modi's rally
 vahiin, ab apana dal bhi modi ke is kaarykram kaa bahishkaar kar rahaa he
 Apna Dal has announced to distance itself from all government programs in Uttar Pradesh
 iske peeche apana dal ke rashtriya adhyaksh or anupriya patel ke pati ashish patel ko pradhanmantri ke swaagat kaaryakramon se dur rakhaa janaa bada kaaran bataaya ja rahaa he
 With this, his dispute over the Lok Sabha seats from NDA is not resolved, till then his party will not be part of the government programs of Modi and Yogi government
 sammaan na dene kaa he aarozpana dal ke rashtriya adhyaksh ashish patel bijepi sarkaar par sammaan na dene kaa aarope laga chuke hai
 He said in the past that he wants respect in the coalition

 2008 main kasaab aayaa, to 2015 main kasim
 Kasab was the commander of Lashkar
 kasim lashkar kaa ladaaka
 Kasab was from Okara village in Faridkot, Pakistan
 kasim faisalabad ke gulam mohammad abad colony kaa rahane vaala he
 Kasab came from a poor family
 kasim medis class parivaar se niklaa
 Kasab was fidayeen
 kasim sirf hamalavar
 Yes, now a big change is also coming in the terrorists being prepared on the land of Pakistan
 lashkar jo kal taksirf garib ladakon ko islam ke naam par aatank ke liye khadaa karata tha
 He is now also associating educated boys with him
 aise yah baat saamne aa rahi he ki kya lashkar ke aatank kii ranneeti thik usee tarah badali he, jaise sansad par hamale ke baad jab pakistan main lashkar ko lekar sawaal uthe the, to hafiz saood ne jamaat-ul-daawa bana kar khud ko paak-saaf qaraar diya tha
 Lashkar was formed in 1986 and jamaat-ul-dawa in 2002
 donon main sabase bada antar yahi tha ki lashkar bandook uthaata, lekin jamaat-ul-daawa saamaajik taur par kaam karata
 Most of the youths who had come out of poverty or justified terror in the name of Islam, would have been associated with Lashkar, mostly those who carried guns in the name of Islam
 lekin ab teen sawaal mahatvapurn ho chale hai
 The answer is very important
 pehla sawaal he kikya lashkar aatank ko shahari yuvaaon se jodne main safal ho rahaa he? doosraa, kya fidayin kii jagah padhe-likhe ladaake bandook uthaa rahe hai? or teesraa ki kya kasim kaa pakadaa janaa lashkar kii ranneeti kaa hissaa he? teesraa mahatvapurn he kyonki kasim ke chehre par koi shikawa nahin tha
 The way he is caught, it seems that either he will not have the train of fidayeen properly or he has not become fidayin to identify himself

 BJP national spokesperson Tarun Vijay said in a press conference, "omar Abdullah has failed to control the disobedient and anti-national forces in the Kashmir Valley
" centre ko is baat ko dekhne ke liye nishchit taur par karrwai kerani chahie ki vah un tatwon ke khilaaf karrwai karen

 unhone kaha ki kendriya grih mantri pi chidambaram kii apane pakistani samakaksh se vaarta kaa koi aadhaar nahin tha
 "there was no basis for Chidambaram's talks with his Pakistani counterpart Rahman Malik and foreign secretary level talks between the two countries," Vijay said
 jab tak pakistan is baat kaa thos saboot nahin detaa ki vah bharat virdohi gatividhiyon kaa samarthan nahin kar rahaa he tab tak us desh ke saath baatcheet kaa koi matlab nahin he
 He said, "foreign Minister SM Krishna had earlier described Pakistan as the center of all kinds of terrorism, but suddenly talks with Pakistan under clear US pressure
" ’’unhone kaha ki sansad main sarvasammati se paarit prastaav main kaha gaya tha, ‘‘hamen pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir ke hisse ko waapas hasil karnaa chahie

 ’’ Many districts of Rajasthan are under severe heat
 alam ye he ki jaisalmer, jodhpur, barmer jaise jilon main din kaa taapmaana 50 degree tak pahunch ja rahaa he
 Despite such scorching heat, our BSF personnel guard the border by standing at the border
 biguef javaanon ko garmi se raahat dene ke liye border par maujuud objaraveshan tower ko air condishand karne kaa faisla kiya gaya he
 Air Condition Observation Posts have been made at some places in bsf's 56 Battalion Jaisalmer
 yahaan se BSF ke jawan pakistan kii chalbaasiyon par najar rakhenge
 This observation post will have all the facilities through which BSF personnel can protect the border by protecting themselves for several hours amidst this sandy tornado
 jaankaree ke mutabik fensing ke aasapaas har 3 kilometre kii duuri par is tareeke ke air condishand objaraveshan post banane kaa plan he jo ki garmiyon main sakriy kar diya jayega
 Now do this, it is normal to heat up to 50 degrees in the heat desert
 khaskar may maah hameshaa garam hi rahata he
 In such a situation, the youngsters are ready for this in advance
 aisi bheeshan garmi main bhi javaanon kii gasht kaa kaam kabhi bhi nahin thamata he
 Seals are constantly provided with glucose and lemonade to protect them from the heat, so that no one gets sick
 garmi se bachaav karne ke liye do-do ghante main duty badali jaati he
 Also, instead of camels for patrolling, Desert Scooters are used to provide some relief to the camels along with the soldiers
 ankhon par kaala chashma lu se bachaata he or pani kii bottle ko bore main lapet kar rakhte hai, taaki pani thanda rahe
 The young man holds a cap and a cotton shot over his head to avoid heat here
 garmi se bachane ke liye kai baar aajamaaya gaya 'kool jacket'rajasthan kii tapati ret main BSF ke javaanon kii duty kaaphi kathinaayee bhari hoti he
 In the past several years, many private companies, even DRDO, have tested several times with BSF personnel by making cool jackets to protect the body from heat
 lekin yah kool jacket puri tareeke se BSF ke javaanon par set nahin hui
 Because whenever this cool jacket was worn above the waist by the soldiers, the top part would cool down due to the cool jacket
 baaki ke hisse garm rahete hai jisase thande or garm kaa ehsaas sharir ke alag-alag bhaagon par hota he
 So in the initial phase, cool jacket was tested for sandy areas but it did not get much success
 in kool jacket kii ye khaasiyat he ki isamen 12 pocket hai
 In these, packets of phase change material (PCM) chemicals are kept
 ye pisiem ke packet javaanon ke sharir ko kareeb chah ghante tak thanda rakhane main sahaayak hote hai
 After this these pcms have to be kept back in deep freeze for recharge
 richarge ke baad dubaara iskaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Cool jackets did not get that success due to all these tricky techniques
 yahi vajah he ki ab jaisalmer ke kai ilaakon main air condishan objaraveshan post lagaakar BSF ke javaanon ko suvidhaayen di ja rahi hai
 Due to this, they do not have to face any kind of difficulties in patrolling the border in summer
 Many false charges levelled against us by our former allies
 Our commitment to the Agenda of Alliance, co-authored by Ram Madhav & endorsed by senior leaders like Rajnath Ji never wavered
 It is sad to see them disown their own initiative & label it a 'soft approach
 '1 / 6status quo on Article 370, dialogue with Pakistan & Hurriyat were a part of aoa
 Encouraging dialogue, withdrawing cases against stonepelters & the unilateral ceasefire were much needed measures to restore confidence on the ground
 This was recognized and endorsed by BJP

 com / jsmmstkjsi — Sitaram Yechury (@sitaramyechury) February 14, 2016 america raashtrapati baraak obama ne is saal janvari main bharat yatra se thik pehle india today ke liye mujhe ek i-mail intervyuu main kaha tha ki unke desh or bharat ke liye ab sitare hi kuch aisa sanyog bana rahe hai ki ve samrik sambandh sthapit karen jo ab tak ruk-rukkar chalate rahe hai
 The rise of Narendra Modi with a clear majority in India led to a dramatic change in the picture
 congress party kii us vam-udaaravaadi hichak ko darkinar karke saarvajanik raay main dakshinpanthi rujhaan sthapit hua, jo kukhyat “antni vito” kii badaulat america ke saath sainya rishton kaa vistaar karne main prabhavi rup se tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko bhi laachaar bana de rahaa tha
 That page has now been reversed
 iskaa or sakshya haal hi main america raksha mantri eshton carter kii sankshipt yatra ke taur par dekhne ko mila
 He has kept his temperament busy with dealing with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in West Asia, China's provocative activities in the South China Sea, the continued collapse in Afghanistan and the polarized debates of the year before the election on the domestic front
 In the meantime, not only took the time to visit India, but started the journey giving a clear strategic message to the Eastern Command of the Indian Navy
 From Visakhapatnam
 contribooting editor shekhar gupta ke saath exclusive intervyuu main unhone vishakhapatnam se yatra kii shuruyaat karne kii ahmiyat ko sweekaar kiya, balki yah bhi kaha ki, “haa, ek arth main yah bharat kii luk east niti or america ke asia-prashanth or hind mahaasaagar main punarsantulan sthapit karne kii koshish kii sweekaarokti he
 We are both equal forces
 ”asaamaanya rup se yel se bhautikee or madhyakaalin itihaas, donon main snaatak or oxford se parmaanu bhautikee main piechdi, carter ne harvard or emity main antarrashtriya sambandh or suraksha vishyon ko padhaayaa bhi he
 Carter has written and studied several important books, including one challenging Reagan's strategic security initiative in 1987, and wrote a brilliant paper on "catastrophic Terrorism" in collaboration with then CIA Director John Deutsche
 antarrashtriya str par unhen samrik niti kaa diggaj mana jaataa he
 As soon as Deutsche is mentioned, he jokes that "that paper was the most forward-looking paper to be completely ignored", especially given that 9 / 11 happened three years later
 baatcheet ke khaas anshaapaka desh chunaavon kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 In this case, what kind of foreign policy does America need? In the new perception that seems to be forming, it is being realized that America should not export American values and protect its interests
 kya yah khud ko hi dekhne kaa sanket he?meraa yah maananaa he ki america main dirghakaal main apane hiton kii suraksha karne kii ek lambii parampara rahi he, isliye unhen un mulyon se puri tarah se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa, jinhen vah badhaava detaa he, or ham hameshaa in donon ko ek-duusare se judaa maanate hai
 How does this match post-9 / 11 perceptions? The Pentagon is the ideological part of the American government and for that the whole world is divided into friends or enemies? i don't think so
 raksha vibhaag main ham rojaanaa duniyabar main is hakeekat se rou-ba-rou hote hai ki duniya main sab kuch kaala yaa safed nahin he or vah bahut jatil or mishrit he
 This is the thing that you learn first when you are entangled around the world, as America is entangled, that things are not usually spontaneous, black and white
 ab kuch baaten aisi hai jo sidhe taur par kharaab hai or unase aapako jujhna hi haih iesaiel, aatankwaadiyon ke haathon main jansanhaar ke hathiyaar, dhaanchon ko giraane yaa masuumon ko prabhavit karne ke liye kiye ja rahe sibar hamale, aatankwaad kyonki uskaa nishaanaa nirdosh log hote hai
 These things can fall into the category of black or white, wrong or right, good and bad
 lekin deshon, logon, ilaakon ko is tarah se baanta nahin ja saktaa
 Now, since we started the phase of correcting things, we try not to mention Pakistan in any important American conversation
 par ek bhartiya patrkaar ke rup main mere liye yah bahut mushkil he ki itani lambii baatcheet ke baad lashkar-e-tayba kaa zikr na kiya jaae, kyonki mere jaise logon kaa yah maananaa he ki pakistan kaa ab bhi apane pichhawaade maujuud aatankwaadiyon yaa aasteen main chhipe sanpon ke bare main najariya alag he, jo usko bhi kaat sakate hai, or angan main maujuud sanpon ke bare main alag, jinke bare main vah yah maanata he ki ve uske niyantran main hai
 i start from where you did, that is, we do not share
 america ne lambey arase pehle yah karnaa band kar diya tha
 However, in response to your question on Lashkar, we believe that we have to oppose every form of terrorism
 ab uske liye chaahe jo bahaanaa diya jaae, unke paas jo bhi vajahen hon, america hameshaa lashkar kaa virodh karata he
 Pakistan has done enough? We have been continuously pushing Pakistan to take more steps and if it is said that Pakistan has done more
 mujhe lagata he ki aakhirkaar pakistan main kuch logon ko yah mahasoos hone laga he ki aatankwaad ko pryojit karne yaa usamen lipt hone yaa uskaa aakraamak rup se muqabla na karne main khud pakistan ke liye jo bhayanak khatre maujuud hai, vahi uske paas ladane kii kisi anya prerana se zyada badi vajah he
 It is not my responsibility to mention the other particular example you are referring to, but i think that Foreign Minister John Kerry and our Embassy officials here are very clear about how much we are about the judicial process regarding Lashkar are worried
 aapane kaha, pakistan main “kuch
 "is the number of people like this enough in your assessment, and is it important in the decisions that feel the futility of judging the snakes of their sleeves apart from the snakes in the front courtyard? i think it's my assessment that i wanted to clarify
 yahi ki aatankwaad unke khud ke liye musiibat kaa jariya ho rahaa he
 Now in such a situation, is any country including Pakistan doing everything that we want to see them doing against terrorism? No, we want more steps, but they are doing more than before and we are encouraging them to move in the same direction
 jab subah aapaki aankh khulti he to aap samrik taur par duniya kii sthiti ko kis tarah se dekhte hai?samrik rup se ham sabhi ke liye (main maanata hum ki aaj kii duniya main ham sabhi vaishvik takat hai) jarurat is baat kii he ki ham vah najariya viksit karen jisamen ham alag-alag tarah kii suraksha chunautiyon se ek saath nibat saken
 For example, ISIL
 
 
 rus or ukraine, phir china bhi he
 Russia's behavior in Ukraine is exactly like the ancient times when countries directly attacked a neighbor, that's why we are strongly opposed to it
 china ke halaat ekadam alag hai
 Our stand on that is that we want to see China progressing peacefully
 un vaayu suraksha kshetron or airspes jatiltaaon kaa kya jo ab hamen china, dakshin china saagaar main dikh rahi hai?pichley lagbhag ek saal main dakshin china sagar main jis baat kii ore dhyaan gaya he vah chini daawey kii gati or paimaana he
 
 
 Does India have reasons to worry? Like America, India relies heavily on shipping for its trade, its security
 yahaan mudda bharat ke kisi nikat pados kaa to nahin he lekin bharat ek samudri takat he or dakshin china sagar ke jariye avaagaman or vyapaar par to nirbhar karata hi he
 Is there any significance in starting the voyage to Visakhapatnam which is the headquarters of our Eastern Naval Command? Yes, in the context that it indicates the importance of maritime security for both India and America
 is baat ko pratibimbit karti he ki samudri ilaake main bharat kii “act east” niti or america kii asia prashanth or hind mahaasaagar ilaakon main punarsantulan kii niti samudr main jaakar mil jaati hai

 The huge defeat of the Bharatiya Janata Party in the three big states of Rajasthan, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, is being seen as a blow to 'brand Modi'
 kuch hi maheenon main loksabhaa chunaav hona he, aise main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke liye in chunaavon ko ek litmes test ke taur par dekha ja rahaa tha
 And in this test, Congress President Rahul Gandhi proved to be the greatest Alexander
 BJP gujarat main to 25 saal ke raaj ke baad bhi kisi tarah batch gai thi or phir se sarkaar banane main kaamyaab rahi
 But this could not happen in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, where the challenge was to save the 15-15 year rule
 chhattisgarh main to BJP kaa safaya ho gaya, madhya pradesh main takkar rahi
 In Rajasthan, Vasundhara Raje also could not save the rule of 5 years
 lekin baat ab raman singh, shivaraj singh chouhan yaa vasundhara raaje kii nahin he
 It is also in the name of Narendra Modi, with whose support the BJP won 2014 and plans to win 2019 as well
 is haar ke baad 'brands modi' ko nishchit taur par rajnatik chot lagi hogi
 Although Narendra Modi was not contesting directly in these elections, but he is the biggest face of the Bharatiya Janata Party and Modi was also the target of Rahul Gandhi
 MP main kisi ko bahumat nahin, sarkaar banane kii koshishe tej
 
 
 Live Updates: In the last few years, Narendra Modi's name and his face were considered to be a guarantee of victory
 lekin in vidhansabha chunaav main ye jaadu feekaa pad gaya
 Modi's name also could not cross the bjp's fleet
 vaise to piem modi ne jor lagane main koi kami nahin kii, phir bhi wo bijepi ko us haar se bachaa nahin paae
 Rahul Gandhi's victory just before the 2019 elections can increase the Congress's morals
 vipaksh ko milegaa bada boost!rahul gandhi ne press conference main elaan kiya ki hamane aaj bijepi ko haraaya he or 2019 main phir haraayenge
 Tackling Team Modi right before 2019, this is the biggest win for Rahul Gandhi & Company
 pehle gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko kaante kii takkar, phir karnataka main sarkaar bananaa or ab teen rajyon main sidhi bijepi ko patkhni dene se ye tay ho gaya he ki rahul gandhi vipaksh ke netaa number van hai
 Question on Brand Modi's credibility? Even though the leadership of the state has claimed responsibility for the defeat in the three states, but the message being given by the opposition is that they have directly defeated 'brand Modi'
 2019 kii pariksha se pehle ab bhartiya janata party ko ek baar phir apni ranneeti par vichaar karne kii jarurat he
 The challenge before the BJP is also how it can retain the shine of the brand Modi

 Despite India's repeated warnings, Pakistan is not deterring its actions on the Kashmir issue
 kashmir ko lekar chal rahe vaak yuddh ke bich pakistan ne kaha ki kashmir ke bhavishya ko lekar koi bhi faisla sirf kashmiriyon ke dwaara hi kiya jayega, jabaki nai dilli ne ek din pehle hi spasht kiya he ki jammu-kashmir bharat kaa he or vah kabhi bhi pakistan kaa hissaa nahin banegaa
 Reacting to the statement given by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, 'the whole of Jammu and Kashmir belongs to India and it will never be a part of Pakistan', Sarataz Azizane, advisor to the Pakistani Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs, said, "such a decision on the future of Kashmir is only in Kashmir
 People can tell, not the Foreign Minister of India
 ’ maamle main apane paksh ko majboot banane kaa prayaas karte hue ajij ne kaha, ‘sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ne kashmir ke logon ko is adhikaar kaa vaada kiya he
 The referendum in Kashmir, he said, "the time has come for India to allow the people of Jammu and Kashmir to exercise the right of referendum in an independent and impartial manner under the supervision of the United Nations
" ekbar kashmir ke log bahumat se pakistan yaa bharat main shaamil hone kaa faisla kar len
 The whole world will accept this decision of Kashmiris
 ’vaani kii hatya ke baad bigade halatsartaaj ajij ne kaha, ‘yahaan phir se bharat is tathy ko nazarandaaj nahin kar saktaa he ki bharat adhikrut kashmir main 50 se zyada jagahon par 2,00,000 se zyada kashmiriyon neburhan mujffar vanike janaaje kii namaaj main hissaa liya tha
 This happened despite curfew imposed in the valley and still continues 15 days after the killing of Wani on 8 July 2016
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki jaisaa ki ek bhartiya lekhak hamen yaad dilaate hai, zyada vakt nahin hua jab british ne bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke sipaahiyon ko vishwasghaatee or aatankwaadi kaha tha, kyonki us vakt bharat ko british samrajya kaa hissaa mana jaataa tha
 "interfere with the Kashmir issue," the United Nations said, "pakistan requests the United Nations, the international community and human rights organization to play its role in preventing Indian atrocities against innocent and destitute Kashmiris in India-occupied Kashmir

 ' arabiai ne pichley hafte 200 rupee ke note jari kiye the
 But it may take two-three months to reach people through atms right now
 iske liye atm ko pehle upyukt banaaya jayega
 Some banks have even asked ATM companies to start testing new notes to make the machines suitable for them
 haalanki kuch bainkon ko nae note kii aapurti nahin hui he
 After demonetisation in November last year, banks made ATM machines suitable for new notes
 arabiai ne ek bayaan jari kar kaha tha ki 200 rupee ke note kii aapurti jald shuru kar di jaaegi
 But RBI has not told by when these notes will become available in sufficient quantity
 nahin mila dishanirdeshetm banane vaali companiyon ne kaha he ki unhen arabiai se 200 rupee ke nae note ke anuroop atim main badlaav karne ke bare main koi dishanirdesh nahin mila he
 He said that some banks have unofficially asked him to start testing the new note, as its size is different
 bataa den ki desh main kul 2
 There are 2
5 million ATM machines, and they are yet to be tailored to the new note
 agies transact technologies limited ke adhyaksh or prabandh nideshak ravi bi
 Goyal told IANS, "but the ATM friendly process will start only after getting instructions from the RBI
 nae noton kaa aakaar prachlan main chal rahe noton se alag he
 As soon as we get new notes, we will understand its size and will be able to make ATM accordingly
 uske baad hamen yah dekhnaa hoga ki kya noton kii aapurti atm ko puri kshamta se chalaane ke liye paryaapt he
 "this company has installed 60 thousand ATM machines
 90 dinon main puri hogi prakriyounhone kaha, "atm ko anukool banane kii puri prakriya 90 dinon main puri hogi, or atm kaa niyamit sanchaalan prabhavit nahin hoga
 As a matter of fact, atms will remain fully operational during adaptation and supply of 100, 500 and 2000 notes will continue
 "atm banane vaali anya companiyon main ensiaar korporation he, jiske paas 1,08,000 atm mashine hai
 In addition there is BIT Payments, which has 4,500 installed machines
 bainkon ne shuru kiya pareekshan ke liye samparkensiaar korporation ke mahaprabandhak (sevaayen) anand garolu ne kaha, "bainkon ne nae noton ke parikshan ke liye hamase sampark shuru kar diya he
 They will tell us which machine they want to make worth 200 rupees
 haalanki nae note hamen bank dwaara hi uplabdh karaae jaaenge, jiske baad hi pareekshan shuru ho paaegaa
 "the ATM will soon be made worth 200 notes to BTI Payments Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer
 shrinivas ne kaha, "jab hamen paryaapt maatra main 200 rupee ke note milenge, tab ham mashiinon ko inke laayak banane kaa kaam shuru karenge
 We are keen to start this work as soon as possible
 " yah company arabiai se adhikrut he, jo un atm mashiinon kaa sanchaalan karti he, jinka swaamitv bainkon ke paas nahin hota or bank unka prabandhan bhi nahin karte hai
 Currently 200 rupee notes available in select banks are currently available in select RBI offices and some banks
 haalanki bhartiya state bank or punjab neshnal bank ne kaha he kiunhen 200 rupee ke nae note mili hai, jabaki mangaluru main korporation bank ke kevaisi-antimony londering cell ke prabandhak ekanath baaliga ne bataaya ki puure desh main unke bank kii ek bhi shakha ko 200 rupee ke note praapt nahin hue hai
 The 200 rupee note being printed in the RBI printing press is currently being printed in the RBI printing press itself
 suraksha printing and minting corporation of india (espmasiel) ke sutron ne bataaya ki company ko abhi tak 200 rupee ke note kii chapai kaa koi nirdesh nahin mila he
 Two note-printing companies in the country are owned by RBI, while two are owned by SPMCL, which is a state-owned company

 ” bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke liye apane ummidavaaron kii pehali suchi ke elaan se thik pehle 15 sitambar ko bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kaa patna sthit warroom ko diya gaya yahi sandesh he
 With this aggressive strategy, the BJP has now started announcing the names of the candidates on the basis of their social assessment without waiting for the list of RJD-JD (U) -congress Grand Alliance
 kaante ke mukaable main party ab “aage badho” kii ranneeti ke saath maahaul ko apane paksh main karnaa chaahati he taaki aakhri samay main hawa kaa rukh dekhakar matdaan karne vaale matadaataaon ko aakarshith kiya ja sake
 The reason for the aggressiveness of the BJP, which is adopting a tight strategy so far, is its ground preparation
 isaki shuruyaat yun to janvari main hi ho chuki thi lekin use disha di shah ne 14 april ko patna ke kaaryakarta samagam main
 Shah had then said in a meeting with special strategists, "out of 62,779 booths in Bihar, 9,302 booths were decided by a margin of 50 votes in the Lok Sabha elections
 isliye hamen sari urja booth par lagaani hogi
 If we win the booth, we will win the election
 hamen har booth par kam se kam 100 vot badhaane kii chintaa kerani he
 According to Shah formula, the difference of 50 votes in 36 assembly seats can prove to be decisive in the battle of this party's reputation
 booth jito, bihar jitobarik prabandhan (micromanagement) ke maahir maane jane vaale shah ne vahi formula apanaaya he jise pradhanmantri banane se pehle narendra modi ne apanaaya tha
 a strategy was created to create an atmosphere in favor of the party in villages rather than cities
 prabandhan main sabase pehle bijepi ne booth cameti banaai jisamen sanyojak samet 14 aise log chhante gaye jo usee booth ke matadaata bhi hon
 In this way, the party created an army of 27,800 people in every assembly constituency, who are directly attached to the warroom at Fraser Road, Patna
 is warroom ko party se jude yuva udhyami ruturaj sinha ne aadhunik takneekon se is kadar las kiya he taaki kahin bhi, kisi gadabadi kii gunjaaish na rahe
 Regarding this warroom, Sinha tells India Today, "in Bihar, when the anti-coalition coalition was busy putting up hoardings-posters in the cities, we had left for the village
 bihar kaa bhavishya gaanv tay karegaa
 We have collected and classified the data of the members from each booth
 booth samitiyon kaa gathan ho chukaa he
 Referring to the strategy of organizing booth workers to communicate energy, he says, "all our 245 Parivartha Chariots are equipped with state-of-the-art technology and we can sit anywhere and see photos, speeches, crowds etc
 from our mobiles
 Huh
 ”booth str ke kaaryakartaaon ke jariye party ne deevaaron par naare likhane, gharon ke daravaaje, gadipoon par stikar, chhaton par jhande lagane kaa kaam ranneetik lihaaj se aage badhaayaa he
 The party believes that the person who will put flags, stickers and bjp's promotional material on the walls with his consent, will openly be a supporter of the party
 lekin bijepi ke liye chintaa kii baat yah bhi he ki jis warroom se vah apni ranneeti ko anjaam de rahaa he, vah aapasi khinchataan main bhi fansaa hua he
 Rituraj Sinha, who holds the title of Amit Shah, is running a warroom off Fraser Road in Patna
 unka kaam booth prabandhan or parivartan rath se judaa he to doosraa warroom party daftar se prabharee mahasachiv bhupendra yadav chalaa rahe hai, jahaan poster-hordings vagairah ke saath parivartan yatra or anya intjamaat kii dekharekh ho rahi he
 According to sources, Bhupendra was in charge of the same warroom as in-charge
 haalanki is khinchataan se itar bijepi ne patibaddh kaaryakartaaon kii puri fouj banane main baarik se baarik pahaluon kaa dhyaan rakhaa he
 The party organized booth workers by sending Parivartan Rath to all the assembly constituencies
 is rath main video ke jariye narendra modi ke bhaashan, nukkad naatak kii team maujuud he
 This chariot is monitored through GPS and in which area how much attention is being given to this chariot, it is also directly monitored by warroom
 is rath ke saath hi party ne parivartan yatra shuru kii, jisamen party ke sabhi varisht netaaon ko sabhi vidhansabha siton main jaakar sabhaayen kerani thim
 After this, the party made a blueprint for Parivartan rally and got four big rally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 is chaar stareey abhiyaan ke saath party ne media, soshal media ke jariye bihar main parivartan kaa sandesh dene kii koshish kii
 All the booth committees have been connected to the whatsapp group and the news of the moment is reaching the central leadership through the warroom
 iske alaava tivi bahes main apane or virdohi paksh kii baton kaa bhi sankalan kar rojaanaa report taiyaar kii jaati he
 a senior BJP strategist explains, "shah talks only on the right report based on data
 ve media main roj chhapane vaali khabar main yahaan tak nigaraanee karte hai ki kis akhbaar ne kitni jagah di, kisne photo ke saath bijepi kii khabar chhaapi
 "news-tv news is compiled twice a day
 tivi bahes main apane or virdohi netaaon ne kya bayaan die, isaki bhi samiksha hoti he
 Apart from this, the party's strategy is also to make the insurance schemes of the central government a means of vote
 ek ranneetikaar bataate hai, “hamane har vidhansabha main 20 hajaar logon ko beemaa yojana banti he
 According to four voters in a family, consider our 80 thousand votes as fixed
 agar ek vidhansabha main 60 fisadi vot padataa he to vot ek se dedh lakh ke bich padegaa
 Some of these votes will be taken as independents and the bjp's margin of victory may be 50-60 thousand
 ”ummidavaaron ke chayan main bijepi ne jitau ko ekmaatr paimaana banaaya he
 How much prestige is this election for the party can also be understood from the strategy of candidate election
 shah or sangh ne apane str par ummidavaaron kaa panel to banaaya hi he, khud pradhanmantri narendra modi ne intelegence ke jariye report taiyaar karai he
 Looking at the social equation: Before the RJD-JD (U) -congress Grand Alliance, the BJP started weaving the social equation
 bijepi netaaon kaa maananaa he ki janata parivaar ke vilay kii atakalon ke samay hi party ne yah maan liya tha ki uske virdohi ab ek manch par aane vaale hai
 Therefore, the party rallied in Patna on 23 January on the occasion of Karpoori Thakur Jayanti, in which Shah himself was present
 purv mukhyamantri karpuri thakur ati pichhadon ke bade netaa the or is samaaj ke votaron kii sankhya 30 fisadi ke kareeb he
 Therefore, BJP also celebrated his birth anniversary vigorously in all 38 districts of Bihar by creating a highly backward platform
 parivartan rath ko puure bihar main daudane se pehle party ne saamaajik sameekaran kaa khaas kchayaal rakhaa
 By giving place to 12 society faces on this chariot, BJP has tried its best to get out of the image of the upper caste party
 haalanki party kaa kahana he ki ise saamaajik sameekaran saadhane ke lihaaj se nahin dekhnaa chahie
 Apart from modi-shah on the chariots, pictures of Nand Kishore Yadav, Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly, Sushil Kumar Modi, Leader of the Legislative Council, State President Mangal Pandey, Leaders of the three alliances, Union Minister of Bihar, Former State President and National Officials were installed
 Huh
 prabandhan main koi chook na rah jaae, isliye usne sabhi 243 vidhansabhaon kii saamaajik sameekaran kii report kaaryakartaaon ke jariye ikattha kii he
 Which society is in favor of BJP and which is in opposition, its status has been drawn
 phir apana, virdohi or sahyogi dalon ke sambhavit ummidavaaron ke 10-11 naamon kaa panel mandal str se liya gaya he
 Bhupendra Yadav, general secretary in-charge of Bihar, says, “we have received our report from the workers working on the ground
 bihar ab parivartan ke path par bad chalaa he jo sabhi virgon ko jod vikaas ke raste par aage le jayega
 "why the need for micromanagement? But despite this micromanagement, the BJP is not finding an easy path
" modi lahar main bihar-upi main jabardast jeet hasil karne vaali bijepi kii mushkil nitish-lalu ke gathbandhan se hui jise pehle sapa ke mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav ne bhi samarthan diya tha
 This alliance was seeing an edge in terms of equations for the Lok Sabha elections
 sutron ke mutabik, bijepi main sheersh str par shuruaati akalan main yah baat ubharkar saamne ai ki loksabhaa chunaav jaisi lahar nahin he, lekin narendra modi ke prati aakarshan barkaraar he
 If sources are to be believed, the BJP itself believed that the passion which was in the cadres for Modi during the Lok Sabha elections is no longer the same, even if it votes for BJP
 party ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, “loksabhaa main hamaara kaaryakarta 10-12 votaron ko booth tak khinch kar le aayaa tha
 Now the same passion is for Lalu Yadav in the Yadav society because after 10 years he can see his strength coming back
 kurmi samaaj bhi loksabhaa main apane netaa nitish kumaar ke apmaan ko nahin pachaa paa rahaa
 There is no reason to divide Muslim votes either
 yani hamaari ladaai in voton main bikharaav laane kii he
 Initially after this assessment, the BJP focused on micromanagement strategy
 purv mukhyamantri jeethanram maanjhi ko shaamil kar saamaajik sameekaran ko nayaa aakaar de diya
 However, the tussle over seats in the coalition has put the BJP high command on the cusp
 tikaton ke bantwaare se sahyogi dalon ke saath bijepi ke apane kheme main bhi baghawat ke baguule footne lage hai
 However, the BJP is expected to benefit from the split of the Mahagathbandhan's vote by fielding the SP-NCP, Pappu Yadav's party and Asaduddin Owaisi's party
 sangh ke feedback ne badhaai chintaisi vajah se siton ke talmail ke baad bijepi ne apni ranneeti ko aakraamak prachaar kii disha main mode diya he
 But the major reason behind this strategy is the feedback given to the party from the Sangh Parivar
 sutron ke mutabik, sangh ne apane swayamsevakon ke jariye 28 saptaah tak team kii adla-badali kar surveykshan karavaaya, jisamen ek samay endie kii sthiti vidhansabha main maujuuda siton ke mukaable aadhi rah gai thi
 The feedback that the Sangh has given later is also not encouraging as the NDA alliance seems to be struggling to move beyond double digits
 haal hi main 2-4 sitambar ko dilli ke madhyanchal main hui sangh parivaar kii samanvay baithak ke samaapan ke baad sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat samet sangh netaaon ne bihar main kaam dekh rahe rashtriya sah sanghathan mantri saudaan singh ke saath “mukt chintan” kiya
 After this report, the party focused on an aggressive campaign so that the electoral fray becomes saffronised
 nitish-lalu gathbandhan se ubhare jati sameekaran ne bhi bijepi kii mushkilen badhaai hai kyonki jis booth str ke kaaryakartaaon par bijepi daanv laga rahi he, unamem se 14 aise log mili hai jo virdohi gathbandhan ke bhi sampark main the
 They have been shown the way out
 loksabhaa chunaav main mili aitihaasik jeet se bijepi kaa manobal ooncha he
 He is trying to ensure that the elections do not get entangled in any way
 narendra modi ke chehre ko focus main rakhkar party chunaav jeetne main koi kasar nahin chhodia chaahati
 Therefore, Shah himself is eyeing strategy and warroom
 ghar main kapade dhonaa sirf maa yaa ghar kii mahilaon kaa kaam nahin he, yahi massej detaa he arial company kaa nayaa edwartisment
 The video of this new ad is going viral on the Internet in a tremendous way
 video main ek pitaako dikhaaya gaya he jo apni beti ke sasuraal main jaakar apni galtiyaan mahasoos karata he
 Although there are many things about feminism in the world, but this add of Ariel truly shows the message of 'share the load'
 video main dikhaaya gaya he ki ek pita jab apni betike sasuraal jaataa he to dekhtaa he ki kaise uski beti offis ke kaam ke alaava ghar ke sabhi kaam akele sametati he
 Apart from the contents of the child, she does everything alone from the husband's food to the laundry
 aise main pita ko mahasoos hota he ki mahilaon ko ghar main akele kitna kuch karnaa padataa he
 The father remembers in his past that just as he never parted with his wife's work and enjoyed TV just sitting empty, so does her daughter's husband
 aakhir main beti ko alavida kahkar jate samay pita likhitamen puure purush samaaj kii taraf se maafinama likhakar jaataa he
 In the letter, the father goes to his daughter, saying that he will go back home and share his mother's hand in household chores
 arial ke is aid ko tag line bhi di gai he 'share da lod'
 Ariel has touched the hearts of audiences in a very emotional way with this campaign
 pakistan kii ek mahila saansad ne daawa kiya he ki nobel puraskaar vijeta malala yusufajai par 2012 main hua taliban kaa hamalaa ‘‘rachaa gaya ek naatak’’ tha
 "the drama of the attack on Malala was pre-composed," Imran Khan's party Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf MP Musarrat Ahmadzeb said in an interview to the Urdu newspaper 'ummat'
 ’’ unhone is baat par bhi andeh jataayaa ki hamale ke samay goli malala ke sir main lagi thi
 Musratrat tweeted, "malala was shot in the head but no bullet was found in her head in the CT scan in Swat
 parantu haa, peshawar ke siema aspataal main daakhil hote hi unke sir main goli pahunch gai
 He alleged that the government gave land to the medical staff treating Malala
 saansad ne daawa kiya ki malala ne jab bibisi ke liye gul makai naam se kahaniyaan likhin tab unako padhane or likhane nahin aata tha
 He said that an American stayed at Malala's house for three months and trained him for future roles
 yah spasht nahin he ki saansad ne is tarah kii baaten kyon kii hai
 On the other hand, tehreek-e-insaf spokesperson Shafqat Mahmood said that his party had already separated itself from Musharrat for breaking discipline
 gauratlab he ki taliban ke hamale ke baad charchaa main ain malala ko nobel kaa shanti puraskaar mila

 poochtacha ke bich patharbaji main baari kamijankaree ke mutabik jahaan patharbaji main badi lagaam lagi he, vahiin ab in patharbaajon ke paisa bhi nahi pahunch paa rahaa he
 The biggest reason for this is that the separatist leaders and traders who bring the fund from Pakistan to the stonemasons are in the grip of the NIA
 jiskaa asar sidhaa patharbaji kii ghatnaon main kami ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 Ever since the NIA started its investigation with separatist leaders in this manner, the incidents of stone pelting in the valley have come down due to the fact that all the separatist leaders who have been continuously accused of this, He used to give 500 and 1000 rupees a day to the stoneworkers for stonework

 par is saal keval 1 june se lekar 11 july tak jisame 44 aatanki maare gaye
 During this period, the stone was made which was negligible
 aankde bataate hai ki 1 june ko baraamula main 2 aatanki maare gaye
 After this, 4 terrorists were killed in Bandipura on 5 June
 vahi 7 june ko kupwada main chaar aatanki phir maare gaye
 On 8 June and 9 June, 8 militants in Baramulla and Kupwara were pelted by security forces
 aapako bataa den ki 10june ko bandipura main chaar aatankwaadiyonko ek baar phir suraksha balon main maar giraaya
 On 16 June, three militants Junaid Mattoo, Nasir and Adil Mushtaq were surrounded by security forces in Arvani of Anantnag
 iske baad 21 june se lekar 11 july tak lashkar or hijbul ke 18 aatankwaadiyon ko alag-alag jagahon par suraksha balon ne maar giraaya
 The fierce stone pelting took place at the time of Burhan Wani's death
 On 8 July last year, Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani was killed in an encounter by security forces
 iske baad se ghati main lagaataar 120 din se zyada patharbaji lagaataar hoti rahi
 In which thousands of security agencies were injured last year and many dangerous marks were made in their bodies due to this stone-pelting
