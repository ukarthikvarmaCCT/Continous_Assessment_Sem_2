 Apart from Jignesh Mevani, many people came in front of the media and supported Mamata Banerjee
 mamata ne dikhaaya dam, bani vipaksh kii netaa number 1!loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ko takkar dene ke liye beete kaaphi lambey samay se mahagathbandhan kii baat chal rahi thi, lekin har baar baat netaa par aakar atakati dikh rahi thi
 On the leadership of Congress President Rahul Gandhi, many parties kept a distance from openly agreeing
 lekin in sabhi ghatnakramon ke bich mamata banerjee hi aise netaa ke taur par ubhari hai, jinaki ek aawaaj par vipaksh ek saath najar aayaa
 It is clear that Mamata has been continuously talking about non-bjp, non-congress alternative, in such a situation, she is strengthening her political pitch by bringing regional parties together and by showing strength in this way

 Shah appealed to the Prime Minister to give 15 years to bring change in the country from panchayat to Parliament
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha ki rahul gandhi gum-ghumkar kehete hai ki in dhai varshon main kya fark padaa he
 We want to tell them that the first thing we have done is that we have given the Prime Minister speaking to the country
 hamane centre main ek aisi paardarshee sarkaar di he jisapar in dhai varshon main virdohi bhi bhrashtachar kaa koi aarope nahin laga sake hai
 Addressing the booth level activists, he said that sonia-manmohan's government has done scams one after the other in 10 years, scams worth Rs 12 lakh crore from space to Hades and Rahulji asks what is the difference 
 bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh ne kaha ki aatankwaad, bhrashtachar, jaali karency or jaali noton par modi sarkaar ke kade prahaar kaa virodh karke sapa, basapa, mamata, congress or kejariwal ne apane-aapako desh kii janata ke saamne expoj kar diya he
 This decision has been taken in the interest of the country, whose benefit is going to get the most from the poor in the coming times

 Shah said that black money was sucking the blood of the country's economy by becoming canker, we have eliminated it in one stroke
 unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi bhi kaale-dhan par karrwai kaa virodh kar rahe hai, hamen rahul baba par to koi aashcharya nahin ho rahaa he, unke salaahkaaron par jarur taras aa rahaa he
 He said that we had promised before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections that if the Bharatiya Janata Party government is formed in the country and Narendra Modi becomes the Prime Minister of the country, then we will work to secure the borders of this country
 unhone kaha ki sonia-manmohan sarkaar ke 10 varshon main koi bhi hamaari simaaon kaa apmaan karke chalaa jaataa tha, hamaare javaanon kaa apmaan karata tha, seemaa par shaheedon ke sir kaat liye jate the or dilli ke hukmaranon ke jun tak nahin rengti thi
 He claimed that Rahul Gandhi would not know the difference because he had Italian glasses on his eyes
 sonia-manmohan kii sarkaar ke samay seemaa par golibari kii shuruyaat pakistan kii sena karti thi or ant bhi pakistan kii hi sena karti thi, aaj bhi seemaa par golibari kii shuruyaat pakistan kii sena hi karti he lekin use khatm bhartiya sena karti he

 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha ki bhartiya janata party or baaki partiyon ke chunaav jeetne kaa tarika alag he
 The BJP is a party with a definite target based on ideology
 unhone kaha ki yadi ham apane lakshya ke saath ham puure desh kii janata ko jod nahin pate to ham akele apane lakshya ko hasil nahin kar sakate
 The Bharatiya Janata Party can never win an election without its booth worker, it is our work culture, we have attached a lot of importance to the ideology of the booth which has been created to advance our ideology
 unhone kaha ki desh kii janata ko bhartiya janata party ke lakshya ke saath jodne ke liye bhi sanghathan kii bhoomika kaaphi mahatvapurn ho jaati he
 BJP is a party where even the smallest activists get big opportunities
 unhone sawaal kiya ki kya desh main koi duusari party he jahaan itane garib ghar main janm lene vaala vyakti sanghathan main kaam karte-karte desh kaa pradhanmantri ban sake, aisa banane ke liye aapako ek nishchit rajgaraane main janm lenaa padegaa
 He said that in many parties it is already decided who will be the next president of the party
 congress kaa udhaaharan dete hue unhone kaha ki congress kaa aglaa adhyaksh koun hoga, yah sabko pataa he lekin bhartiya janata party kaa aglaa adhyaksh koun hoga, kya yah kisi ko pataa he?tippaniyan Amit Shah said that BJP is the only party whose even a booth-level worker can become the national president of the party
 chunaav main haar-jeet bhaajapa ke liye koi myne nahin rakhti lekin yadi hamaara sanghathan majboot banataa he to hamen jeetne se koi nahin roak saktaa
 Shah said that for the first time after 30 years, the people of the country have taken a decisive decision and the Bharatiya Janata Party government has an absolute majority under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha ki aazaadee ke baad yadi kisi gaiyr-congressi dal ko desh kii janata ne purna bahumat dene kaa kaam kiya to vah bhartiya janata party he

 ) shah ne desh main panchayat se sansad tak badlaav laane ke liye pradhanmantri ko 15 varsh dene kii apil kii
 BJP President Amit Shah said that Rahul Gandhi roams around and says what a difference it has made in these two and a half years
 ham unhen bataanaa chaahate hai ki hamane to sabase pehla kaam yah kiya he ki desh ko bolne vaala pradhanmantri diya he
 We have given such a transparent government at the center on which even these two and a half years, opponents have not been able to make any allegations of corruption
 booth str ke kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue unhone kaha ki sonia-manmohan kii sarkaar ne 10 varshon main ek ke baad ek ghotaale kiye, antariksh se lekar pataal tak 12 lakh karod rupee ke ghapale-ghotaale kiye or rahulji poochhate hai ki fark kya aayaa he
 BJP national president said that SP, BSP, Mamta, Congress and Kejriwal have exposed themselves to the people of the country by opposing the strong attack of Modi government on terrorism, corruption, fake currency and fake currency
 yah faisla deshhit main liya gaya he jiskaa phayda aane vaale samay main desh ke garibon ko hi sabase zyada milane vaala he
 Shah said that till November 7, the opposition parties were making a ruckus on Prime Minister Modi for taking action on black money, after taking harsh action by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on black money on November 8, he has now made a bitter cry for why demonetisation Did it? He said, 'I want to tell that with this one decision, terrorists, Naxalites, fake currency and drug dealers have become poor, the money lying with those who hollowed out the country's economy has turned into a waste
 shah ne kaha ki kaala dhan nasoor banakar desh ke arthtantr kaa khun chus rahaa tha, hamane use ek hi jatke main samaapt kar diya he
 He said that Rahul Gandhi is also opposing action on black money, we are not surprised at Rahul Baba, his advisors are definitely feeling pity
 unhone kaha ki hamane 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle vaada kiya tha ki yadi desh main bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar banati he or narendra modi desh ke pradhanmantri banate hai to ham is desh kii simaaon ko surakshit karne kaa kaam karengen
 He said that during the 10 years of the sonia-manmohan government, nobody used to go insulting our borders, insulting our jawans, beheading martyrs on the border and not licking the lice of Delhi's rulers
 unhone daawa kiya ki rahul gandhi ko fark pataa nahin chalegaa kyonki unki aakhon par italy kaa chashma laga hua he
 During the time of sonia-manmohan's government, the Pakistan Army started firing on the border and the Pakistan Army did the end, even today the Pakistan Army starts firing on the border but the Indian Army does it
 shah ne kaha ki aaj hamaare javaanon ko dushmano kaa munhtod jawaab dene ke liye dilli se order lene kii jarurat nahin padati, aaj seemaa par goli kaa jawaab gole se diya jaataa he
 BJP president Amit Shah said that the way the Bharatiya Janata Party and other parties win elections is different
 bhaajapa vichaardhaara ke aadhaar par ek nishchit lakshya lekar chalane vaali party he
 He said that if we do not connect the people of the whole country with our goals, then we cannot achieve our goals alone
 bhartiya janata party apane booth kaaryakarta ke bagaiyr kabhi chunaav nahin jeet sakati, yah hamaari kaarysamskruti he, hamaari vichaardhaara ko aage badhaane ke liye booth kii jo rachana kii gai he, use jansangh se lekar ajtak hamane bahut mahatv diya he
 He said that the role of the organization also becomes very important to connect the people of the country with the goal of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 bhaajapa ek aisi party he jahaan chote se chote kaaryakartaaon ko bhi bade maukey milte rahete hai
 He questioned whether there is any other party in the country where a person born in such a poor home can become the Prime Minister of the country while working in the organization, to become such, you have to be born in a certain royal family
 unhone kaha ki kai partiyon main pehle hi tay ho jaataa he ki party kaa aglaa adhyaksh koun hoga
 Giving the example of Congress, he said that everyone knows who will be the next president of Congress, but who will be the next president of the Bharatiya Janata Party, does anyone know? amit shah ne kaha ki bhaajapa ekmaatr aisi party he jiskaa booth str kaa ek adana sa kaaryakarta bhi party kaa rashtriya adhyaksh ban saktaa he
 The victory and defeat in the election does not matter to the BJP, but if our organization becomes strong then nothing can stop us from winning
 shah ne kaha ki 30 saal baad pehali baar desh kii janata ne ek nirnaayak faisla kiya he or pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritva main bhartiya janata party kii purna bahumat kii sarkaar bani he
 He said that after independence, if the people of the country worked to give absolute majority to any non-congress party, then it is the Bharatiya Janata Party

 uttar pradesh main sarkaar chaahe kisi dal kii ho, murtiyon hameshaa charchaa main rahati hai
 At this time, the issue of Dalits is hot, so the statues of Bhimrao Ambedkar remain a threat throughout the country
 pratimaa ko nuksaan pahunchaana upi main kanoon vyavastha ke najariye se bhi samvedansheel masalaa he
 When the Uttar Pradesh government ordered the protection of Ambedkar's statues all over the state to the police and the administration, new views also began to emerge
 kai shaharon main ambedkarki pratimaa ke chaaron ore gril yaa jaali lagaakar taala laga diya gaya
 At Ambedkar University in Lucknow, the life-size statue and other small statues have been surrounded by a grill and channelgate and locked
 aisa pehali baar nahin ho rahaa he
 Earlier, the statues of Ambedkar and Periyar in Tamil Nadu have been under siege and lockout
 vahaan bhi aae din pratimaaon ko nuksaan pahunchaaya jaataa tha
 Statues are more at risk around Ambedkar Jayanti
 upi main mahatma gandhi se zyada bhimrao ambedkarki pratimaayein hai
 There is always danger on both the statues of the country
 gandhiji kii pratimaayein 70 se zyada deshon main hai or pakistan ko chhodkar shaayad hi kisi anya desh main uskaa apmaan hua ho
 At the level of ideas that insult statues are extremely weak and stupid people
 ye samajhnaa ki pratimaa yaa chitra ko nuksaan pahunchane se vichaar ant ho jayega nihaayat morrkhtaa he
 But apart from the mischievous elements, the other people who have damaged the statue want to hurt the feelings of its followers, causing people to get angry and the law and order looms
 pratikon ko nuksaan pahunchaakar dabadabaa kaayam karne kii maansikta bhi hoti he
 The credit for the politics of statues in UP goes to Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati
 jinaki khud kii pratimaayein bhi lagi hui hai
 But Ambedkar's statue is said to be directly associated with the vote bank
 teen saal pehle uttar pradesh main lakhanu ke najadik ambedkar kii 150 feet oonchi pratimaa lagane kii ghoshnaa hui thi
 It was said that it would be even higher than the world famous Christ Redeemer, but later no significant progress could be made on it as no land was found for it
 lekin daliton kii raajnneeti ke liye puure desh main paryaapt jameen maujuud he
 It contains idols and insults them
 phir do raajnneetik dal ek duusare par aarope lagaate hai or antaheen silsilaa chalata rahata he
 On 13 April, just before Ambedkar Jayanti, the statue of Ambedkar has been damaged in Noida, the police are beating hands and feet to install another statue
 mahatma gandhi kii pratimaa ke saath bhi akasar budtamiji hoti rahati he
 The destruction of symbols and national property has become a habit of the people as politicians are giving vent to it and governments remain silent
 mana jaataa he ki puri duniya main sabase zyada murtiyon gautam buddha kii hai lekin unpar shaayad utani raajnneeti nahin hoti jitani ki hamaare desh ke mahapurushon kii pratimaaon ke naam par hoti he

 Even mild military action will not take the risk
 iske jawaab main global times main kaha gaya he ki china bhi yuddh nahin balki shanti kii bahaali chahta he or saath milakar aage badhanaa chahta he
 But the situation may be different if the Indian Army continues to hover over the land of China
 global times ke video main kaha gaya he ki agar bharat chaalaaki karegaa to yuddh ko rokna mushkil he or bharat lagaataar china kii chetavanee ko ansuna karata rahaa to yuddh hi ek maatr vikalp bachegaa

 In Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena has received two major setbacks and that too from the BJP
 pehla tab, jab bhaajapa ne pichley vidhansabha chunaavon main acchhee taadaad main siten jitkar shivasena ko apraasangik kar diya tha
 The second shock came on Thursday when BMC results came out
 maidan main shivasena ko daraa chuki bhaajapa ne ab shivasena kaa ghar hilaa diya he
 Shiv Sena has done better than BJP in Mumbai
 lekin yah antar chand ek siton kaa he
 This time the runner-up is the winner in this game and nobody thinks it better than Shiv Sena
 aatmavishvaas se bhare uddhav thakare shaayad guuruuvaar ko chaiyn se so bhi nahin paaenge kyonki unki jeet kii khushi se kahin badi chintaa bhaajapa kii apratyaashit jeet he
 The BJP has shaken the confidence and fort of the Shiv Sena
 maharashtra kii pahchaan par bani shivasena ab bhaajapa ke aage kaaphi choti or asahaay nazar aa rahi he
 Uddhav, the sweet of victory, must have seemed pale because the Shiv Sena in Mumbai, which was watered by Maratha identity and identity, would compete with the BJP itself and the BJP would stand up to them by relieving their habit of dependence
 bhaajapa kii jeet shivasena ko mili janadesh par batta laga rahi he
 At the same time, Shiv Sena is seen leaving his house and his chauvinism
 bhaajapa kii jeet main shivasena ke bhavishya kii chintaaen chhipi hai
 The mandate with which Uddhav landed in this election and the manner in which he refused to join hands with Raj Thackeray, this mandate seems to be a stumbling block
 keval mumbai hi he jahaan shivasena kii jeet unako santvanaa detii nazar aati he
 The rest of Maharashtra seems to be divisive

 It is possible that the dependencies of politics can bring both of them together and both of them can be seen together holding the BMC, but at this time the Shiv Sena will not forget its kachot and the defeat hidden in its victory will continue to haunt Uddhav even in dreams
 
 bhaajapa ke liye yah jeet sone par suhaaga he
 She will be seen standing in Maharashtra with more confidence

 Noor Mohammad said in the tone of advice that money can be deposited in several installments in Naga accounts
 nur mohammad ke mutabik wo apni kamishan rakh kar avaidh noton ko vaid noton main badalane kaa kaam kara degaa
 It was clear that Noor Mohammad was referring to the open misuse of the provision of the Income Tax Act under which the tribes of Nagaland, Tripura, Manipur, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh are kept out of the purview of income tax
 lekin naga khate akele nahin hai jinka purvottar kshetra main tex chor apnikali kamaiko khapaane main kar rahe hai

 The comments ajam ne ab tak keval teen test match khele hai
 He missed a century against New Zealand in Hamilton by a slight margin in the test
 babar ne naabad 90 ran banaae lekin pakistan kii puri team out ho gai thi
 Apart from three tests, Azam has played 18 odis, scoring three centuries
 ye teenon shatak unhone is saal ke shuru main westeindies ke khilaaf lagaataar lagaae the
 This blistering debut of Babar is indicative of him becoming a big player, but it cannot be ignored that there have been many players who soon lost their perspective after shining early in their careers
 jaahir he is tulana ke baad babar par apekshaaon kaa dabaav bhi bad gaya hoga
 Shoaib Akhtar, former Pakistan fast bowler and known as Rawalpindi Express, has given a very moderate response to this comparison
 apni gendon kii gati se nami ballebaajon ko bhaybheet karne vaale shoeb ne twit karke kaha ki coach miki arthor kaa maananaa hi ki babar, bhartiya cricketer viraat kohli jitne hi achche ballebaaj hai
 In the case of comparison of Babar and Virat, i would like to say that it is okay to praise the young batsman but do not cast him in any mold at the moment
 use abhi ballebaaji kaa anand uthaane den
 Azam has played only three Test matches so far
 vah hamiltan main newjiland ke khilaaf test main maamuli antar se shatak chook gaye the
 Babar scored an unbeaten 90 but Pakistan's entire team was dismissed
 teen test ke alaava ajam ne 18 vanade khele hai jinamein teen shatak lagaae hai
 He had scored all three centuries against the West Indies earlier this year
 babar kii yah dhamaakedaar shuruyaat unke bade khilaadi banane kaa sanket de rahi he lekin is baat kaa nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa ki kai khilaadi aise rahe hai jo kariyar kii shuruyaat main chamak dikhaane ke baad jald hi paridrishy se ojhal ho gaye
 Obviously , the pressure of expectations on Babur would also have increased after this comparison
 pakistan ke purv tej gendbaaj or rawalpindi express ke naam se mashhoor shoeb akhtar ne is tulana par behad sanyat pratikriya di he
 Shoaib, who frightened the famous batsmen with the speed of his balls, tweeted that coach Mickey Arthur believes that Babar is as good a batsman as Indian cricketer Virat Kohli
 babar or viraat kii tulana ke maamle main, main yah kahana chaahunga ki yuva ballebaaj kii prashansa karnaa to thik he lekin use philhal kisi saanche main na dhaalein
 Let him enjoy batting now
 apni gendon kii gati se nami ballebaajon ko bhaybheet karne vaale shoeb ne twit karke kaha ki coach miki arthor kaa maananaa hi ki babar, bhartiya cricketer viraat kohli jitne hi achche ballebaaj hai

 Team India's poster boy Virat Kohli touched new heights with his great performance in the World T20, but included himself in the list of great cricketers but due to poor performance of the top bowlers, the hosts were eliminated from the semi-finals
 terning wicket par bhartiya spinners flopakhitaab se kam par santosh nahin karne vaale bhartiya cricketpremiyon ko semifinal main team kii haar nagavar gujri hogi
 The Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led team was expected to prove itself as the king in tabling cricket for the second time on its own
 kohli ne akele dam par jahaan bharat ko semifinal tak pahunchaaya, vahiin ravichandran aswin or ravindra jadeja kii gendbaaji ausat rahi
 Both took a total of eight wickets in five matches
 terning viketon par ve gend ko turn nahin kara sake or ballebaajon kii ashgaah vankhede kii pich par to unki jamkar dhunaai hui
 Talking about the positive aspects of the World T20 Virat, Kohli proved himself to be the heir of Sachin Tendulkar, who kept carrying the burden of expectations of crores of Indians
 kohli ne paanch maichon main 273 ran banaae lekin ranon ke aankadon se zyada unki ballebaaji kaa kaushal dekhakar logon ne daanton tale ungliyaan dabaa lee
 He scored an unbeaten 82 against Australia after scoring an unbeaten 55 against Pakistan on the turning pitch
 semifinal main bhi usne naabad 89 ran banaakar team ko bada score diya lekin nateeja bharat ke paksh main nahin aayaa
 Kohli's 29 fours were excellent shots whether it was a cover drive or a square cut
 flop rahe rohit, shikhar or renakohli ko hataa diya jaae to world tii20 main bharat kaa koi doosraa nayak nahin dikhataa
 Dhoni's run between the wickets was superb and equally memorable was the running out of Mustafizur Rahman against Bangladesh
 kohli ke baad sarvaadhik ran banane vaale bhartiya dhoni rahe jinhone paanch maichon main 89 ran banaae
 Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Suresh Raina failed to meet expectations
 rohit ne haalanki semifinal main behatar pradarshan kiya
 Nehra and Bumrah's bowling may have looked effective in the last four but on many occasions it seemed that Dhoni could change his bowling attack
 jamatha ho yaa eden gardns, harbhajan singh ke rup main tisare spinner ko utaara ja saktaa tha
 This year, Bhajji has played the only T20 match against the United Arab Emirates, which is unfair with the third bowler taking the most wickets for India in Tests
 gendbaaji main bharat ke liye ashish nehra ne acha pradarshan kiya
 Young Jaspreet Bumrah bowled a superb 19th over against Bangladesh while Hardik Pandya showed that there was still room for improvement

 (with input from Hemant Sharma) uttar pradesh ke nae police mahanideshak (dijipi) sulakhan singh ke har taraf charche hai
 Not because of any controversy but because of his simplicity, diligence and honesty
 upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne sulakhan singh ko upi kaa dijipi bana kar ek saath kai sandesh die hai
 This has boosted the morale of the officers who work honestly, while there is uneasiness among the officers who have shown their interest on the strength of jugaad from influential leaders
 police force main sabase senior hone ke baavjood sulakhan singh kaa naam khaaki vardi kii top post ke liye aage nahin tha, lekin yogi ne unke naam par muhar lagaakar sabhi ko chaunkaaya
 The faces of corrupt officers are the most hanging after the command of UP Police as commander Sulkhan Singh
 aakhir kya he sulakhan singh kii khaasiyat? kya he unke adarsh? jaaniye sulakhan singh kii kahani unheen kii jubaani
 5 things you might not know about them
 1
 Honesty is the best policy: Sulkhan Singh, wherever he was posted during his 36 years of duty, his honesty is read everywhere
 sulakhan singh :eemaandaaree kisi ke raste kaa roda nahin he
 Those who are dishonest have to face trouble
 eemaandaar aadmi ko koi dephence taiyaar nahin karnaa padataa
 Those who are dishonest need such preparation
 isliye main hameshaa maanata hum ki onasti ij da best policy!2
 Simple Family, Extraordinary Personality: Sulkhan Singh has a very simple family background
 banda main inkaa 3 kamare kaa kaccha makaan he, jahaan unke buudhe mata pita or bhai rahete hai
 Sulkhan Singh lives in a 3 room flat of LDA in Lucknow
 sulakhan singh :main har chaar maheene main banda jaataa hum
 Sometimes parents also come here, but they like to stay in Banda instead of Lucknow
 yahaan lakhanu kaa ghar kishton main liya he jo abhi puri nahin hui hai
 3
 chunautiyon ke saamne adig:sulakhan singh varanasi ho yaa elahabaad yaa phir unnav, jahaan bhi rahe apni alag chhap chhodane main safal rahe
 Whether it was the student movement of Varanasi in 1984 or the posting in the Unnao Training Center as a posting posting during the Samajadi Party Government
 sulakhan singh kaa vyaktitv har chunauti main or nikharaa
 Sulkhan Singh: It is true that i was hurt when i was transferred to Unnao Training Center in 2012
 vahaan diiji level kaa afasar niyukt hota he or main iske liye senior tha
 i also protested but i did not hear
 iske baavjood teen saal ke kaarykaal main training centre main aisa kaam kiya ki bharat sarkaar kii taraf se mujhe 'exlens in training' kaa medal mila
 4
 bachapan kii yaaden or ramcharita maanas:sulakhan singh chaar bhai he or unke pita ek kisaan hai
 They only have 2
 3 bigha jameen he
 Sulkhan Singh and his brothers did their schooling in Banda
 sulakhan singh:hamaare parivaar main hamaari peedi formal ajukeshan main pehali he
 Our father only went to school for a year or two
 unka puraa gyaan ramayana or mahabharat kaa he
 We learned the full lesson of Ramcharitmanas from him
 hamaare mata pita ne hameshaa protsaahan diya
 Dad used to restrain a little but he was very confident
 bhagwaan kii krupa se sab kuch thik hua
 5
 sada jivan, ucch vichaar:sulakhan singh kii saadagi ke chalate unke bachmet unako yogi kehete the
 In Banda, he was often seen doing yoga in the morning
 sulakhan singh:mukhyamantri sanyasi vyakti hai or meri unase tulana nahin he
 That's right, i do yoga and also included yoga in the syllabus of training
 lekin sirf yogasana karne se ham yogi nahin ho jate
 We should improve our behavior, and if it happens then everything will be correct
 dhoni ne test cricket se sanyasakya liya, unke jivan kaa nae sire se postmortem kiya jane laga
 The statement of Tamil actress and model Lakshmi Rai has also come out in one such episode
 khabaron kii maane to lakshmi raay or mahendra singh dhoni ke bich kuch vakt afaire rahaa tha
 Then both of them broke up
 ek english newspaper se baat karte hue lakshmi raay boleen, aaj itnaa vakt biit gaya, magar jab bhi dhoni kaa zikr aata he, to meraa naam liya jaataa he
 He said that even today rumors of their romance are blown out
 lakshmi ne kaha ki unhen is tarah kii atakalon se nafrat he
 Speaking to the newspaper she said, i am sure that my relationship with Dhoni has become like a scar, which will not go away easily
 raay ne kaha ki mujhe achraj he ki log abhi bhi is kaam main apni urja khapa rahe hai
 He said that i am afraid that sometime in the future my children will watch it on TV and ask me
 dhoni ke baad bhi mere teen chaar logon ke saath rishte rahe
 But no one noticed him
 dhoni ke saath apane rishton par baat karte hue lakshmi boleen, main unhen bahut achche se jaanati thi
 But it could not say whether it could have been named a relationship
 yah kabhi bhi clic nahin kiya
 But we still respect each other very much
 vah bhi apni jindagi main aage bad chukaa he
 He is married
 hamaari kahani to vahiin par khatm ho gai
 i am also focusing on acting now

 pehali baar india today ne collejon kii ranking kab kii thi iskaa to dhyaan nahin magar das baarah saal se yah patrika reating to kar hi rahi he
 Every year there was a special issue of Best College
 number van college kii tasviir hoti thi
 There used to be a picture of happy students, who used to think that there are number one colleges in India too
 ham sabane in visheshankon ko dekha hi hoga
 After this, many agencies and news channels started making number one, number two, in which private colleges started to dominate
 phir bhi kuch college tamaam tarah kii soochiyon main sthaayee bhav se bane rahe
 It is not that the government was not grading colleges at that time
 vishvavidhyalay anudaan ayog ujisi ke tahat national assessment and accredition council naac kii sanstha bhi collejon or vishvavidhyalayon kii grading kar rahi he
 Naik's headquarters was made in Bengaluru in 1994, any college, university can invite Naik's team to come and visit their institute, by paying fees with service tax up to one lakh, one and a half lakh, three lakh and six lakh
 Check and give grading
 7,674 kalege hai or 313 vishvavidhyalay
 Out of these, 47 universities and 807 colleges have done their grading from NAAC in 2014-15
 e grad vaale ko paanch-paanch saal par grading karaani hoti he or e se neeche vaale ko teen-teen saal main grading karaani hoti he
 There have been several reports of Naik
 isse shiksha kii gunvattta main kya sudhaar hua he, iskaa moolyankan tivi kii bahes main sampurna rup se to nahin ho saktaa he magar ham is sandarbh main yah sawaal kar sakate hai ki jab pichley teen bajet se hi shiksha kaa bajet kam hota ja rahaa he to nack kii grading ke baad bhi in sansthaanon main sudhaar kis had tak ho sakaa hoga
 All the budgets before the last three budgets have been the same
 ham shiksha main kharch kam karte ja rahe hai
 Can the quality of education be increased without spending? college kii grading main sudhaar ho saktaa he
 We also have to see how the colleges in the districts and state capitals have improved in comparison to the college or university of metros in the evaluation journey of Naik
 kya ve lagaataar pichhadate hi chale gaye hai
 The Union Ministry of Human Resources has introduced a new rating system from 2016
 National Institutional Ranking Framework kii duusari report saamne ai he
 It is different from Naik
 nack main grading hoti he yani ek grad main das college ho sakate hai
 You will get to know number one or number two in the ranking
 nack ke alaava ranking kii jarurat kyon padi
 What are we going to achieve differently from this? yaa phir nack kii jo sanstha itane varshon main viksit hui he wo samaapt ho jaaegi
 This new rating system is developing slowly, so many colleges could not even apply
 lau kalege yaa medical kalege kii is saal reating nahin nikali he
 Many colleges were busy preparing for NAC, could not apply for new ratings, yet this time 3300 higher institutions took part in it
 in 3300 main chotii ke sau collejon kii suchi nikaali gai he
 Was looking at the new rating list of colleges
 isamen doordaraj ke kuch collejon ko bhi pehle sau main jagah mili he
 Not in the first hundred but in the top ten and twenty colleges
 dilli vishvavidhyalay main saare college reating system main aavedan nahin kar sake magar puure bharat main chotii ke bees collejon main dilli vishvavidhyalay ke aise collejon ke naam hai jo campus ke nahin maane jate hai or paaramparik rup se mashhoor collejon kii suchi main nahin aate the
 Many colleges including Stephens, Hindu and Ramjas did not participate in the new rating, yet out of hundred colleges in India atmaram sanathan dharm college paanchaven number par he
 Dayal Singh College is number eight
 dinadayal upaadhyaay college 9 wein number par he
 Keshav College is at number 15
 acharya narendra dev 20 wein number par he
 This July, when the process of admission will start in Delhi University, how much importance will the students give to this ranking, will it affect the cut-off list of the college as well
 abhi hamane aapako bataaya ki maanav sansaadhan mantralay kii ek sanstha nack bhi grading karti he
 NAAC was renamed as National Assessment and Accreditation Council, Ministry of Human Resources in 2015 created a new institution for ranking named National Institutional Ranking Framework
 17 janvari 2017 ke hindustan times kii report ke anusaar dilli vishvavidhyalay kaa ek bhi college e plus nahin paa sakaa he
 DU colleges could get only a plus
 dabl plus kisi ko nahin mila he
 Acharya Narendra Dev College has got a grade in the list of NAC but is ranked number 20 in the ranking of nifr
 nack kii suchi main gurunanak dev khalsa college ko bi plus plus mila he
 In the ranking of nifr, this college is ranked 46th all over India
 nack kii reating main dinadayal upaadhyaay college ko bi grad mila he magar nai ranking main yah college puure bharat main 9 wein number par he
 The comments yah kaise ho saktaa he? jo college nack ke taap ten main nahin he wo aal india main number van or jo kalege nack kii suchi main diu ke 62 collejon main 9 waan sthaan rakhata he wo aal india level par 20 wein number par he
 India's number one colleges do not even appear in the top hundred colleges in the world
 2015-16 kii times hair ajukeshan ranking kii suchi main bharat kaa ek bhi college yaa uniwarsity nahin he
 The Indian Institute of Science, which ranked number one in India's rankings in the Times Higher Education ranking list for 2015-16, is between 251 and 300
 tisare number par aayaa iaiti times ranking main 351 se 400 ke bich he
 When there is a rating of countries in the world, why won't colleges be
 ham tivi vaale to tiarapy ke hi maare hai
 Alien Yamuna may be grazing cows in Khadar or keep killing Baghdadi every night, maybe there is a channel number one
 hamaare peshey main number van kaa matlab patrakarita se ho jaruri nahin he
 Perhaps number one in the university means education and better research
 lekin kya vishvavidhyalayon yaa collejon kii reating ko bhi is nazar se aap dekh sakate hai
 Does the rating give a true picture of a college or education system
 bataaya gaya ki reating ke liye niyam kaaphi sakht kiye gaye hai
 Colleges have to give affidavits for this
 ab us halafname ko bhi public kiya jaataa to public jaanch kar sakati thi
 Under the UGC UGC, the institution of national assessment and accredition council naac is also grading colleges and universities
 1994 main bengalooru main nack kaa mukhyalay banaaya gaya tha, koi bhi college, vishvavidhyalay ek lakh, dedh lakh, teen lakh or chah lakh tak sarvice tex ke saath fees jamaakar, nack kii team ko aamantrit karvaa saktaa he ki wo aae or unke santhaan kii jaanch kar grading de
 There are 7,674 colleges and 313 universities
 inamen se 2014-15 main 47 vishvavidhyalayon or 807 collejon ne nack se apni grading karai he
 Those with a grade have to do grading at five-five years and those below a have to do grading at three-three years
 nack kii kai report aa chuki hai
 What has improved in the quality of education from this may not be fully evaluated in the TV debate but in this context we can question that when the budget of education is getting reduced from the last three budgets only To what extent would these institutions have improved even after the grading of NAAC? pichhali teen bajet se pehle ke tamaam bajaton kaa bhi yahi haal rahaa he
 We are reducing spending in education
 kya bina karch ke hi shiksha kii gunvattta bad sakati he
 College grading may improve
 hamen yah bhi dekhnaa hoga ki nack ke moolyankan kii yatra main mahanagaron ke college yaa vishvavidhyalay kii tulana main kasbon zilon or rajyon kii rajdhaniyon ke collejon ne kitna sudhaar kiya he
 Have they gone backward continuously? kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantralay ne 2016 se reating kii ek nai vyavastha shuru kii he
 The second report of the National Institutional Ranking Framework has come out
 ye nack se alag he
 NAC has grading i
e
 there can be ten colleges in one grade
 ranking main aapako number van yaa number tu jaanane ko milegaa
 Why did rankings need to be held apart from Naik
 isse ham kya alag hasil karne ja rahe hai
 Or the institution of Naik which has developed over so many years, will end
 reating kii yah nai vyavastha dhire-dhire viksit ho rahi he, isliye bahut se college aavedan bhi nahin kar paae
 Law college or medical college has not been rated this year
 bahut se college nack kii taiyaari main hi uljhe rahe, nai reating ke liye aavedan nahin kar sake, phir bhi is baar 3300 ucch sansthaanon ne isamen hissaa liya
 The list of the top hundred colleges in these 3300 has been extracted
 collejon kii nai reating kii suchi dekh rahaa tha
 Some remote colleges have also got place in the first hundred
 pehle sau main nahin balki chotii ke das or bees colejo main mili he
 All the colleges in Delhi University could not apply in the rating system, but the top twenty colleges across India have names of colleges of Delhi University which are not considered on campus and were not traditionally in the list of famous colleges
 stephens, hindu or ramajas sahit kai college ne nai reating main hissaa nahin liya tha phir bhi bharat ke sau collejon main se Atmaram Sanatan Dharma College is at number five
 dayaal singh kalege aathven number he
 Deendayal Upadhyay College is at number 9
 keshav mahavidhyalay 15 wein number par he
 Acharya Narendra Dev is at number 20
 is july main jab dilli vishvavidhyalay main admishan kii prakriya shuru hogi to chaatr is ranking ko kitna mahatv denge, kya iskaa asar college ke cat aaf list par bhi padegaa
 We just told you that Naik, an organization of the Ministry of Human Resources, also does grading
 nack kaa puraa naam hua national assessment and accredition council, maanav sansaadhan mantralay ne 2015 main ranking ke liye ek nai sanstha banaai jiskaa naam he National Institutional Ranking Framework 
 As per Hindustan Times report dated 17 January 2017, not a single college of Delhi University has been able to get a Plus
 diu ke college adhiktam e plus hi paa sake
 Nobody gets double plus
 nack kii suchi main acharya narendra dev kalege ko e grad mila he magar nifr kii ranking main 20 wein number par he
 Gurunanak Dev Khalsa College has got a b + plus in the list of NAC
 nifr kii ranking main is college kaa sthaan puure bharat main 46 waan he
 Deendayal Upadhyay College has got a b grade in Naik's rating, but in the new rankings, the college is ranked 9th in the whole of India
 tippaniyan How can this happen? The college which is not in the top ten of NAC is number one in All India and which ranks 9th among the 62 colleges of DU in the list of college NAC is number 20 at All India level
 bharat ke number van college duniya main chotii ke sau collejon main bhi nahin aa pate hai
 There is not a single college or university in India in the Times Higher Education ranking list for 2015-16
 2015-16 kii times hair ajukeshan rekking kii suchi main bharat kii ranking main number van sthaan paane vaala indian istitute aaf science 251 se 300 ke bich he
 Ranked at number three is between 351 to 400 in the IIT Times rankings
 jab duniya main mulkon kii reating ho rahi he to collejon kii kyon nahin hogi
 We TV people are killed by trps
 alian yamuna khadar main aakar gaay charaa rahe hon yaa bagdadi ko har raat maarthe rahiye, ho saktaa he ki koi channel number van ho jaae
 In our profession, number one does not necessarily mean journalism
 shaayad uniwarsity main number van kaa matlab padhai-likhaai or behatar research se hi hota ho
 But can you see the rating of universities or colleges also from this point of view
 kya reating kisi college yaa shiksha vyavastha kii sahi tasviir pesh karti he
 It was told that the rules for rating have been made very strict
 iske liye collejon ko halafanama dena padaa he
 If that affidavit were also made public, then the public could investigate

 Alien Yamuna may be grazing cows in Khadar or keep killing Baghdadi every night, maybe there is a channel number one
 hamaare peshey main number van kaa matlab patrakarita se ho jaruri nahin he
 Perhaps number one in the university means education and better research

 bataaya gaya ki reating ke liye niyam kaaphi sakht kiye gaye hai
 Colleges have to give affidavits for this
 ab us halafname ko bhi public kiya jaataa to public jaanch kar sakati thi

 Kareena has done commercial films like 'kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham', '3 Idiots', 'bodyguard' and 'raa-one', while also doing different roles in films like 'chameli' and 'talaash'
 ofbeet filmein karne ke peeche kya kaaran tha? karina ne kaha, 'maine 'chameli' or 'dev' kii, kyonki mujhe khud ko santulit karne kii jarurat thi

 In such a situation, the Railways will run a special train from Chandigarh to Delhi on Monday evening to evacuate the passengers stranded in the cities around Chandigarh and Ambala
 ’ yah rail shaam chaar baje jaaegi or ek lanbaa root legi
 It will reach Anand Vihar in Delhi from Chandigarh via Saharanpur, Meerut, Ghaziabad
 pichley kuch dinon main bharat main jo 'new normal' banaaya gaya he, uskaa asar bahut sari chizon par padaa he
 In such a situation, it is important to make a list of dangerous things that we can all avoid
 is suchi main sabase tazaa pravishti duniya ke mahanatam upanyaason main gine jane vaale liyo tolstoy ke 'waar and pis' kii he
 This novel is considered dangerous by the Maharashtra Police
 ise bhima koregaanv cese main giraftaar kiye gaye saamaajik kaaryakarta varnen gonjalwes ke kilaaf saboot ke taur par pesh kiya gaya he
 The venerable Bombay High Court also asked Gonzalves why they read a book about a war in another country
 yah sach he ki liyo tolstoy se bahut log darate the
 Vladimir Ilyich Lenin was also afraid
 kehete hai, lenin ko do jaaron kaa saamana karnaa tha
 He defeated Jar Nicholas II
 lekin roosi janata ke dilon par raaj karne vaale duusare jaar tolstoy ke saamne ghutane tech die
 Tolstoy was not a Communist, but Lenin knew that he was the soul of Russia
 lenin ne un par kai lekh likhe
 Asked his comrades to respect him
 aise khataranaak aadmi kii kitaab maharashtra police kisi aatankwaadi ke khilaaf saboot kii tarah istemaal kyon na kare
 This dangerous man also influenced another dangerous man
 ve mahatma gandhi the
 The ashram that Mahatma Gandhi built in the Transvaal in South Africa was named Tolstoy Form
 tolstoy ko chitthee likhi to ant main likh diya- aapkaa aagyaakaari sevak
 And in the letter which Tolstoy wrote in response, in the end he respected him like a brother
 donon ishwar or dharm ko apane bheetar pate the
 Even if they disagreed, they would be so respectful that others might be surprised
 tolstoy ne ek sandesh main punarjanm ke siddhant ko kaarij kiya
 Mahatma Gandhi wrote that he wants to print this message, but it would have been good if the thing that rejected reincarnation was removed
 gandhi ne tolstoy se kaha ki ve unako sahamat karnaa nahin chaahate, bas yaad dilaanaa chaahate hai ki punarjanm main karodon bharatiyon kii aasthaa he or is khyaal se unako tasalli milti he
 But Tolstoy was also no less crooked
 unhone likh diya ki ve to nahin hataayenge, lekin gandhi ji ko yah chhot dete hai ki ve chahen to hataa len
 Mahatma Gandhi is also no less dangerous
 unhone ladane ke nae-nae tareeqe nikaale
 Talked about religion and healed the pandas of religion
 apano ke hi imtihaan lete the
 He was shot three times, but he did not die
 rose unhen kai log maarthe hai- unke samarthak bhi or virdohi bhi- ve marane ko taiyaar nahin hote
 So many idols of Godse were made, temples were built somewhere, but he could not come alive and Gandhi could not die
 gandhi kii shiksha bhi kam khataranaak nahin thi
 They taught people civil disobedience
 jahaan bandook nahin chalati, top nahin chalati, tanks nahin chalate, vahaan civil nafarmaani chal padati he
 Governments are most afraid of it
 kuch log bataa rahe hai ki kashmir main bhi civil nafarmaani shuru ho gai he
 Telling the truth was always dangerous - these days it has become more dangerous
 kashmir ko lekar sach bolnaa to or zyaada khataranaak he
 You can immediately be declared a traitor
 aise sach kaa istemaal pakistan kii sarkaar kar leti he
 Government of India is clean in this matter
 use sach yaa jhooth se matlab nahin he, bas kashmir se matlab he
 By the way, the most dangerous thing is Urdu literature
 vah devanagari lipi main likhaa hua to phir bhi chal jayega, lekin farsi main likhi urdu to bilkul nahin chalegi
 In such Urdu, you keep the Quran, keep Ghalib's dewan, keep the pains of sorrow, you can be declared a terrorist
 pichley dinon aise kai maamle saamne aae jinamein kisi ko aatankwaadi sabit karne ke liye saboot ke taur par uske ghar baraamad urdu sahitya pesh kiya gaya
 By the way, books alone are dangerous
 ve aapako sochane ke liye majaboor karti hai
 They make a habit of reasoning in you, providing argumentable material
 watsap uniwarsity ke is daur main kitaab padhane waalon kii iklauti sazaa mob linching hi ho sakati he
 The list of dangerous things is even longer
 inamen computer, sidi, mobile, sim sab aate hai
 The police arrest someone and tell them that two computers, three mobiles and four sims have come out of his house
 computaron ke bheetar kya niklaa he yah baat amuman saamne nahin aati
 In the Bhima Koregaon case also, the police presented cases against Vernon Gonzalves seized from him
 tolstoy ko na jaanane vaale jaj sahab bhi jaanate the ki sidi saboot nahin ho sakati, sidi main hone vaali saamagree bhale saboot ho jaae
 He asked the police what was in the CD
 police ne kaha ki abhi sidi dekhi nahin gai he
 So CD is also a dangerous thing
 isse bachanaa chahie
 It is also dangerous to buy or sell cows and animals
 aapako kabhi bhi pahalu khan banaaya ja saktaa he
 On the way, your life can be beaten and you can be held guilty
 aap agar apane frij main gosht rakhte hai to yah bhi khataranaak he
 You can be kicked out of the house for this and killed like Akhlaq
 or to or, chote bacchon ko ghumana bhi khatarnaak he
 If you are in UP and have taken out a child whose appearance or appearance does not match with you, then the crowd may surround you, beat and kill you
 likhnaa to sabase khataranaak he
 Regardless of how fearfully you write, the truth peeks from somewhere - it either belittles you or opens up the reality of what you are writing about
 aise bahut saare khatre hai jinke bare main likhnaa kam khataranaak nahin
 When Pash had said that the most dangerous thing is that our dreams are dead, he had no idea that such a public undertaking of mass murder of dreams would ever run publicly and we would be scared even while making a list of dangerous things

 In the midst of a run-of-the-mill life and changing lifestyles, people's age has started to decline, while doctors and scientists have found a way to stay alive for more days
 sthasthya sambandhi ek survey or adhyayan main visheshgyon ne paaya he ki jo log niyamit taur par apane partner ke saath shaareerik sambandh banaate hai, vah aam logon ke mukaable lanbaa jivan bitaate hai
 Experts believe that a good sex life is necessary for anyone with a good diet in life
 britain ke ek medical skool ke shodhakartaaon ne haal hi ek survey kiya, jisamen paaya gaya ki sirf acha bhojan karne ke mukaable behatar sex life kaa anand lene vaale log maansik or shaareerik rup se zyada swasth rahete hai
 How to do survey People of different ages were divided into two groups
 ek group ko badhiya khan-paan, fal or subjiyan di gayi
 But he was prevented from having a physical relationship
 iske ulat duusare group ko achche khan-paan ke saath niyamit taur parashaareerik sambandhbanane ke liye kaha gaya
 During this survey which lasted for about two weeks, regular health checkup of the contestants was done
 survey kaa nateezaaise adhyayan main paaya gaya ki group-e ke mukaable group-bi, jinhen niyamit taur par shaareerik sambandh banane kii chhot thi is dauraan behatar rigelt die hai
 Doctors believe that while regular physical relationships are the best exercise, it also keeps you mentally fit, while those who do not make regular physical relationships become frustrated
 yahi nahin,shaareerik sambandh main aruchibhi dimag ke kuch hisson par bura asar daalati he
 According to doctors, having regular physical relationships can be a source of longevity
 saath hi jaruri he ki sambandh apane partner ke saath sirf sambandh banane ke liye nahin balki rishton main mudhrata laane ke liye bhi banaae jaae
 This makes the mind feel happy
 dilli se sate uttar pradesh ke noida main police ne ek aise gang kaa pardaafash kiya he, jo auto rickshaw main baithi savaariyon ko apana shikaar banaate the or unke saath lutpaat kii vaardaaton ko anjaam dete the
 Police has arrested three vicious gangsters of this gang
 noida police ko lagaataar auto savaariyon ke saath lutpaat kii khabaren mil rahi thi
 Since then the police was looking for these miscreants

4,400 from the woman, mobile phone, diary and other items of loot from these miscreants
 is sambandh main thana icotech main mukadmaa darj kar aage kii karrwai kii ja rahi he
 Police is interrogating the captured miscreants

 On Diwali, there was an echo of a 'ban of bombs' on the sale of firecrackers in Delhi and NCR that the Arvind Kejriwal government also exploded a 'twine bomb'
 dilli sarkaar ne neshnal green tribunel (NGT) ko saunpi apni draft report main kaha he ki usne rajdhani kii aabhohawaa saaf rakhane ke uddeshy se tyoharon ko chhod anya sabhi maukon par pataakhe chhodane or aatishbaajee par pehle se hi pratibandh laga rakhaa he
 The Supreme Court has said that there is no 'cracker Free Diwali' happening on the quarter of the crackers regarding the ban on sale, people have already bought firecrackers, we have imposed the ban only late
 pataakhon kii bikri par pabandi ko lekar sadakon par virodh jataayaa ja rahaa he, lekin sadar bazaar or chandani chowk kii galiyon main pichley daravaaje se pataakhon ko lekar kya gul khil rahe hai, ye andaaj lagaana koi rocket science nahin he
 The police are busy in monitoring the saying, but in the midst of all this, such boards are also seen - 'go ahead, work is going on
 ’ab baat kii jaae neshnal green tribunel ko kejariwal sarkaar kii ore se saunpi gai droft report kii
 This report cited the poor climate of Delhi already due to weather and pollution
 saath hi is baat ke liye apni peeth bhi thonki ki pehle se hi pataakhon, aatishbaajee par pabandi laga rakhi he sirf tyoharon ko bakhsha
 With Delhi's political mercury rising due to the increased fares of the metro, the Kejriwal government also told the NGT that Delhi's climate is really changing
 engiti ko bheji report main sarkaar ne kaha ki mausam main badlaav kaa nateeja hi he ki dilli main sardi ke din kam ho gayi hai, garmi vaali raaten bad rahi hai
 The days of rain are decreasing, but the number of days it rains then the water from the sky rains in greater quantity
 saath hi dilli kaa salanaa adhiktam taapmaana bhi badhata ja rahaa he
 The bottom line of climat change in Delhi is that if someone takes Bhimflerband in december-january, then the face starts to sweat
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha najadik hai
 In such a situation, the Shiv Sena has once again started chanting the Ram temple
 apane mukhpatr 'saamana' main shivasena ne piem modi se kaha he ki 'ram mandir kaa nirmaan ab nahin karoge to kab karoge
 Don't just shout slogans of the Ram temple, start putting bricks, 'it is written that' Prime Minister Narendra Modi's confidence has increased after the surgical strike in Pakistan
 lakhanu main dashahra sammelan kar pradhanmantri ne jai shriram kaa naaraa diya
 Modi blew the conch of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly campaign twice by raising the slogan of Jai Shri Ram from the stage '
 uttar pradeshke chunaav bijepi ke liye jindagi-maut kaa sawalsamna main yah bhi likhaa gaya he ki uttar pradesh kaa chunaav bijepi ke liye jindagi or maut kaa sawaal he
 After the Prime Minister comes to Lucknow and shouting Jai Shri Ram, the Ram temple will be established and the Golden Kalash will be installed
 is bhaavana se bijepi ko vot milenge
 There was as much politics on the Ram temple
 ab or kitni raajnneeti kerani he yah ek baar tay kar daalo
 It is further written in Saamana that 'BJP today has an absolute majority of 280
 saath main shivasena sahit anya dal bhi hai
 In such a situation, when you will not build the Parram temple with the strength of 300 mps, then when will you do it
 ram mandir aaj nahin to kabhi nahin
 Don't just shout slogans, start bricks
 kalash chadhaane kaa kaam shivasena karegi hi kyonki babari kaa gumbad jameendoj karne kaa kaam bhi shivasainikon ne hi kiya tha

 sahitya ajtak-2019 kaa doosraa din, kai hastiyaan huin shamilrajaneta va lekhak dilip pandey or janhvi prasad ne kii charchasahitya ke sabase bade mahakumbh 'sahitya ajtak-2019' main rajenta va lekhak dilip pandey or lekhika jahnavi prasad ne shirkat kii
 On the second day of Sahitya Aaj Tak-2019, on Saturday, the two guests discussed Gandhi and children's future in detail
 bataa den ki lekhika janhvi prasad ne 'yuva gandhi kii kahaniyaan' naam kii book likhi he
 At the same time, Dilip Pandey's 'tapi and Bundi Ke Laddu' book is based on children
 'tapaki or bundi ke laddu' dilip pandey kii chauthi kitaab he, jise unhone apni friend chanchal sharma ke saath milakar likhaa he
 During the discussion, politician and writer Dilip Pandey said that it is very important to teach children to live in absence
 agar bachche abhaav main jeena sikh lenge to ve mushkilon ko majbootee se phase kar sakenge
 This will also be good for parents
 agar aap bachche kii har demand puri karenge to aap unako majboot aadhaar nahin de paaenge
 He said that between cartoons like Doraemon, Chhota Bheem, it is also important to tell children about Good Touch and Bad Touch
 bacchon ko hamen apni puraani sabhyataa se bhi avgat karana hoga
 Today's children do not know the alphabet
 They said that today's children may not know about Nataraj pencil, gramophone, reel cassette
 ham-aap jo jindagi jie hai, uske bare main bhi bacchon ko pataa hona chahie
 Today's children are in the era of pen drives, hard disks, memory cards
 unhone kaha ki main chahta hum ki bacchon ko 80-90 ke dashak kii bhi jaankaree honi chahie
 He said that a lot of work needs to be done on the education system in our country
 aaj ke bacchon ko varnmaala ke bare main nahin pataa he kyonki aajkal saundarya or rupaya-paisa sabakuch ho gaya he
 How did an ordinary person become a Mahatma? At the same time, Janhvi Prasad said that we have to walk according to the time
 agar samay ke saath nahin chalenge to pichad jaaenge
 He said that i have tried to explain Gandhi through graphics in my book 'young Gandhi Stories'
 unhone kaha ki gandhi kii vichaardhaara ko lekar duniya main charchaa hoti he
 Gandhi used to talk about non-violence, freedom and cleanliness, everyone knows these things, but people are less interested in knowing how an ordinary person became a Mahatma
 janhvi ne kaha ki maine apane kitaab main gandhi ke aise pahaluon ko shaamil kiya he, jisaki charchaa kam hoti he
 i have tried to explain Gandhi's other form through graphics
 unhone bataaya ki gandhiji ke jivan se judi kai chizon mere se mail khaati hai kyonki unki jeevani bhi aam aadmi kii tarah hi he
 That's why i follow Gandhi
 unhone kaha ki maine graphics ke jariye gandhi ko isliye samajhane kii koshish kii he kyonki logon ke paas samay nahin he
 You can finish reading this book in two hours because everything in it is based on graphics
 unhone kaha ki photo memory kaa hamaare sharir main alag hi mahatv he
 Let us catch things quickly through photos
 isiilie maine graphics ke jariye gandhiji ko samajhane kii koshish kii he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena coalition got a majority in Maharashtra, but the government has not yet been formed in the state
 donon partiyon ke bich mukhyamantri pad ko lekar khinchataan chal rahi thi or ant main shuukravaar ko fadanvis ne rajyapal ko apana istipha saunp diya
 The current term of Maharashtra Legislative Assembly expires on 9 November and a day before that Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has resigned from the post
 haalanki abhi bhi rajya main sarkaar banane ko lekar vikalp khule hue hai
 Both Devendra Fadnavis and Uddhav Thackeray reiterated one thing during their press conference to form the government
 aise main yah baat to spasht he ki sarkaar gathan to hoga bhale isamen der lage
 The Mahayuti of BJP and Shiv Sena failed to form the government
 donon hi partiyaan apane-apane stand par abhi bhi kaayam hai
 Looking at the election results, the decision of the people was only for the government of Mahayuti, in such a situation, there are few options of government formation in the state
 bijepi-shivasena main ban jaae batsarkaar gathan kaa sabase pehla vikalp abhi bhi bijepi or shivasena ke saath kaa hi he
 Because this government will be a strong government
 lekin yah itnaa aasaan nahin hoga kyonki donon hi dal apane stand par aaj bhi kaayam hai
 Shiv sena-ncp government is another option that Shiv Sena along with NCP form government with the support of Congress
 haalanki duusare vikalp main dikkat yah he ki shivasena donon hi partiyon kii dhur-virdohi rahi he
 However, the way Sharad Pawar and Prithviraj Chavan met today
 uske baad kaha ja saktaa he ki congress sarkaar banane ke mood main he lekin vah bina shivasena ke sambhav nahin he
 There is also an option for President's rule, if there is no progress on the formation of the government, then Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari can recommend to implement President's rule in Maharashtra
 aisa hone par 9 november ke baad rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagu ho jayega
 The possibility of re-election is also not ruled out
 The last option is to hold elections in the state after President's rule
 lekin isaki sambhaavna kam hi he kyonki donon hi bade raajnneetik dal bijepi or shivasena apni-apni sarkaar banane kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 Congress is protesting against the increase in railway fares in Mumbai
 ye pradarshan mumbai ke siasti stesan se shuru hua he
 Railways has increased passenger fares by 14%
 mumbai or aasapaas har din kareeb 80 lakh log local kaa istemaal karte hai
 In such a situation, people are strongly opposed to the increase in fares
 rail bhaade main badhotaree se naaraaz shivasena ne badhotaree kaa virodh kar rahe congress par tikhaa hamalaa bolaa he
 Speaking to reporters, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said that the Congress had no right to protest, because the price was only increased in the UPA government
 saath hi uddhav thakare ne ummid jataai ki railmantri se milakar kuch na kuch samaadhaan zarur nikaala jayega
 Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, who is facing all-round opposition to the increase in rail fares, called this increase very important for the people
 unhone kaha ki railway kaafii ghate main chal rahaa he
 In such a situation, this decision was necessary for better convenience
 gadakari ne kaha ki rail bhaade main badhotaree kaa ye faisalaa railway ke astitv ko bachaane ke liye liya gaya he
 Taking a dig at the previous UPA government, he said that in the last 10 years, the policy paralysis situation has arisen in the country, which will have to take such tough decisions to control it
 Abhi tak India chup tha
 Ab hum log bolega aur duniya sunega
