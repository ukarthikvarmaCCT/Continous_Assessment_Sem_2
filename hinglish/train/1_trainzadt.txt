 Participation in the equity market remains at a low level due to factors such as preference for investment in real estate among large population of the country, lack of investable surplus
 iske alaava bazaar main utaar-chadhaav, vittiya jaagrukta kii kami or sarkari protsaahan kaa abhaav bhi iskaa pramukh kaarak hai

 iske vipareet equity market main niveshkon kii kadi mehnat ke chah lakh karod rupye dub chuke hai
 In case of fpis registered as trusts, the government should provide a one-year exemption or special window for the trusts to be converted into a company to change the attitude of foreign investors

 The Finance Minister should have given clarification in this matter but no concrete initiative was taken in this direction

 According to Venkatraman, after being removed from the post of Tata Sons chairman, Cyrus had accused him of misappropriation of transactions worth Rs 22 crore in a letter
 jo bebuniyaad tha saath hi naishanal company lau tribunel main chal rahe cese ke dauraan bhi sirus ne kai jhuthe aarope lagaae
 The court has fixed August 24 as the next date of hearing in the case
 The officer said that he will have to appear in the court and apply for bail

 bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish ve
 N
 khare ke saamne ek file padi thi jisamen unke apane samet desh ke raashtrapati, supreme court ke ek anya nyaayadhish tathaa baar association ke pramukh kii giraftaar kaa warrant tha
 a few hours ago i was told the shocking thing
 2004 kii garmiyon kii baat he, jab ji news ke vijay shekhar naamak patrkaar ne yah dikhaane ke liye koi vyakti kya kar saktaa he, apane faujadaari maamle main ahmedabad kii ek nichali adaalat ke nyaayadhish se sarkaar ke kuch behad majboot, behad prabhaavshaalee stambhon ke khilaaf karrwai ke liye aadesh jari karvaa liya tha
 That year, India was ranked 90th among 146 countries in Transparency International's Corruption Index; Equivalent to Malawi in Africa, also below Colombia in South America
 bharat kuch tarakkee karke pichhali baar 87wein number pahunch gaya
 Corruption in the judicial system 3 out of 5
 1 ank mili (5 sarvaadhik bhrasht pranali ke liye tha)
 4 out of 5 to political parties in view of that grade
 2, media ko 3
 0 and army 2
 8 ank mili
 We forget that corruption in the judicial system is not concerned with judges alone
 darasal, transperency ne 2007 main ek deshvyapee surveykshan kiya, jisamen paaya ki 61 fisadi ghoose kaa bhugtan vakeelon ko kiya gaya, keval 29 fisadi nyaayalay ke adhikariyon ko or 5 fisadi bichauliyon ko di gai
 But judges are weighed on the highest standards of honesty
 lokapal bill paarit karne ke liye pradarshnakariyon kii reliyon, or unamem se kuch main nyaaypalika ko bhi lokapal ke daayre main laane kii maang isliye uth rahi he ki pichley kuch varshon ke dauraan us par chori ke saarvajanik aarope lagaae gaye hai
 Some of these cases: Judges flew provident fund of Ghaziabad district court staff, another judge grabbed the land of Dalits in Karnataka, and relatives of two former Chief Justices of India are so rich that they accounted for their money If we talk about misuse of public office then it can be revealed
 har desh ko nyaaypalika kii javabdehi or aazaadee ke bich jis santulan kii koshish kerani chahie, usamen hamaari vyavastha kaa jhukaav aazaadee kii ore zyada he
 If a judge of a High Court or Supreme Court takes a bribe, there are currently three ways to deal with it
 pehla, aise nyaayadhish ke khilaaf bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish kii manjuuri milane ke baad hi report darj karai ja sakati he
 Second, the punishment often given is the transfer of the judge
 iske liye dand spasht nahin he-kuch maheene pehle gujarat hycourt edvokets association ne yah virodh karte hue hadtaal kar di ki hycourt ke bhrasht nyaayadhishon ke liye gujarat 'damping ground' ban gaya he
 Third, and the only way to remove a High Court or Supreme Court judge from office is through impeachment in Parliament
 aaazaad bharat main ek bhi nyaayadhish ko mahabhiyog ke jariye nahin hataaya gaya he, kyonki uske khilaaf lagbhag do-tihaai sansad kaa matdaan jaruri he
 The trend of hung parliament will make this task even more difficult
 philhal, nyaayamurti paul dainiel dinakaran or nyaayamurti saumitr sen ke khilaaf mahabhiyog kii kaarywahi honi he
 The case of any of them may come first
 desh ke maujuuda mukhya nyaayadhish jis tarah vittiya bhrashtachar par kodaa fatkaar rahe hai, uske chalate kai maamalon kii jaanch ho rahi he, mukademe chalaae ja rahe hai or mahabhiyog kii prakriya chal rahi he
 For example, he allowed a case against the current Justice Nirmal Yadav; The bag of money sent to them had accidentally reached someone else's house
 desh ke vartmaan mukhya nyaayadhish ko nyaayamurti yadav ke khilaaf mukademe kii manjuuri dene ke liye purv mukhya nyaayadhish ke
 Yes
 baalkrishna ke khilaaf mukadmaa na chalaane ke faisle ko badalanaa padaa
 Now Justice Balakrishnan himself is being accused of corruption
 koi santoshjanak pranali kisi vyakti vishesh kii antaratma par is kadar nirbhar nahin hoti
 There are two bills to introduce a new system for disciplining judges - Civil Society introduced Jan Lokpal Bill, 2011 and Judicial Standards and Responsibility Bill, 2010
 civil sosayadi ke jan lokapal vidheyak ko upie sarkaar ke ek aise vidheyak ne kinare laga diya he, jisamen nyaayadhishon ko bhrashtachar ke liye javabdeh nahin mana gaya he
 By the way, the kind of demands that civil society is making, the circular means accountability in front of each other: the Lokpal can allow a case against a judge of the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court can allow any case of the Lokpal in a corruption case May remove member or chairman
 lokapal ke adeshon ke khilaaf apilon kii sunwaayee pehle hycourt or phir supreme court main hogi
 This may lead to a subversive fight for rights or, to a lesser extent, to a smooth settlement between the two
 is sanskaran main do alag praadhikaron kii jarurat hogi jinke aage nyaayadhish javabdeh honge
 The Lokpal, made up of seven non-judges, will allow the prosecution of a judge for financial corruption
 lekin agar bhrasht aacharnon main duusare anuchit vyavhaar-masalan, insidar trading yaa usee adaalat main kisi kareebi rishtedaar ko vakaalat karne kii chhot jaise maamle-shaamil honge to lokapal ke paas usase nibatane kaa adhikaar nahin hoga or nyaayadhish ko ek anya, usase itar karrwai kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 The Judicial Accountability Bill is also due for passage in Parliament
 iskaa jhukaav swatantraaa kii ore zyada he or isamen nyaayadhishon ko apni sampatti kii ghoshnaa karne, vyavhaar ke maanak or anushaasanamak vyavasthaaen tay karne ko kaha gaya he
 Any person can complain against a judge to the National Judicial Oversight Committee, which will consist of two non-judicial members; There will also be the advocate-general, of course, a lawyer, who will appear before the judges he will decide, and will also be a prominent figure posted by the President
 par vah shikaayat ek aisi jaanch samiti ko bheji jaaegi, jisamen jis adaalat ke nyaayadhish ke khilaaf shikaayat hogi, uske do vartmaan nyaayadhish or ek sevanivrutt nyaayadhish hoga
 It is natural to have partiality in this situation
 lekin vyavastha kii safai ke liye anushaasan hi kaaphi nahin he
 The way the courts are organized, they are prepared for corrupt behavior
 durbhaagya se nyaayik pranali kii zyaadaatar samasyaon kaa hal mushkil sudhaaron ke ek hi kram se nikaala jaataa he
 This includes: * Increasing the number of judges, increasing courts and infrastructure and reducing holidays
 vyavastha kii susti kii vajah se qatari main aage badhane ke liye 'speed mani' rishwat taiyaar hoti he
 This leads to a loss of trust from the system and a fertile ground is prepared for the culture of breaking the law; Because often it takes more than a decade to avoid any kind of punishment
 *nigaraanee, niyamit rup se sampatti kii ghoshnaa or hiton ke spasht takaraav kaa bolbalaa hona
 The details of the assets of each judge are recorded on the website of the Supreme Court and some High Courts
 nyaayadhish apni sampatti kii ghoshnaa puri tarah apni marji se karte hai
 The Judicial Accountability Bill makes such a declaration mandatory
 *adaalat kii prakriyaaon ko paardarshee or purvanumaan yogya bananaa
 To bring transparency in appointments of judges and lawyers, allocation of lawsuits and internal expenses
 kuch adaalaton main computarikaran kaa phayda hua he-jisaki vajah se kuch adalati prakriyaayein insaani marji kii bajaae samasya sulajhane ke tay niyam ban gai hai, or isse insaani faislon par najar rakhane main bhi aasaani hoti he
 Therefore it is desirable to place cameras in the Supreme Court registry
 *madhyasthata ko protsaahan dena, madhyasth faislon kaa bachaav karnaa
 When the plaintiff and the defendant are sitting face to face and the only solution is settlement, then there is no scope for corruption
 kanoon ke boj main dabi hamaari adalati prakriyaayein aavednon, kanoonee praavdhaanon, ranneeti or javaabi ranneeti ke ambara main mukademe ke asli mudde ko dhak detii hai
 As an arbitrator appointed by the Supreme Court, i have seen cases on which there was a fight for a decade, but only after a few meetings, the arbitration became amicable
 misaal ke taur par, sampatti ke ek maamle kii madhyasthata ke dauraan duusari baithak main hi saaf ho gaya ki vah maamla adaalat main sirf isliye laayaa gaya kyonki prativaadee ne vaadi ke saath durvyavhaar kiya tha-madhyasthata ke jariye hue us samajhaite main ek maafeename se hi kaam chal gaya
 Arbitrations are free from the endless challenges of court and they increase commercial efficiency and certainty
 isliye unase rishwatakhori kii sambhaavnaaen bhi kam ho jaaengi
 * Easing rules, making justice accessible
 chile or uganda main prakriyaagat niyamon ko aasaan banaae jane ke baad adaalat se sambandhit bhrashtachar main kami aa gai
 The Indian Civil Procedure Code is so intriguing that even the Supreme Court lawyers will appear in a lower court avoiding any minor original trial
 in pechida prakriyaaon kii jaankaree kii vajah se vakeelon or adaalat ke adhikariyon ko paisa vasuulne kaa mauka mil jaataa he, lekin prakriya ko aasaan banane se ye aniyamitataayen kam ho jaaengi
 Every incident of corruption in the system has many factors and many kinds of actors
 sankat kii ghadi lambey samay se lambit sudhaaron ko lagu karne kaa makul mauka hoti he
 Now there is a time when the energy of the people can be diverted towards the appointment of more judges and building court rooms, encouraging arbitration and simplification of rules, besides arguing over the disciplinary mechanism
 kharide gaye varanton ke maamle main pataa chalaa ki nyaayadhish nirdosh tha, lekin shaayad us par jarurat se zyada kaam kaa boj tha or vah laaparvaah tha, or adaalat ke bhrasht adhikariyon evam vakeelon ne warrant jari karvaa diya
 No one was prosecuted and Vijay Shekhar was asked to apologize for spoiling the court image like many other journalists and writers before him
 lekin yah aisa tarika he jo bhrasht ho chuke nyaayadhishon, adalati adhikariyon or vakeelon ko vyavasthit tareeke se chunakar baahar kar detaa he
 This is necessary to maintain people's confidence in the judicial process
 aisa tarika bhrashtachar kii afvaahon ko bhi dur karegaa jo kisi bekasoor nyaayadhish ke irdagird ghaatak dhundh kii tarah chai rahati hai

 Shashi Tharoor said that the CPM and BJP are doing this issue is not right
 congress ke mutabik court ke antim faisle kaa intjaar karnaa chahie
 The Supreme Court refused to hear the contempt petition filed by the court in the Sabarimala temple case in Kerala
 darasal, do mahilaon ke pravesh ke baad 'shuddhikaran' ke liye mandir ko band karne ke khilaaf yachika daakhil kii gai thi, jis par supreme court jald sunwaayee se inkaar kar diya
 In the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said that reconsideration petitions will also be heard on January 22
 chif justise ne kaha ki iske liye alag se bench bananaa mushkil he
 - In view of the call for bandh of many organizations, strong security arrangements have been made

 Kerala: a 55-year-old Sabarimala Karma Samiti worker who was injured yesterday in a clash between CPIM & BJP workers, in Pandalam, has succumbed to his injuries; Police investigation underway
 # sabarimalatemplexaraasala, pandalam main CPIM or BJP kaaryakartaaon ke bich jhadap main ghayal hue sabarimala karm samiti ke ek 55 varshiya kaaryakarta ne ilaaj ke dauraan dam tod diya
 However, police are investigating the case
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki marane vaale shaks kaa naam chandan unnithan tha
 It was opposed to women entering the temple
 sabarimala mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh ke mudde ko lekar united democratic front rajya main 'kaala diwas' manaane kii taiyaari main
 Not only this, many Hinduist organizations have called for a state shutdown today
 rajya main band kaa elaan ko dekhte hue suraksha ke pukhta intjaam kiye gaye hai
 In fact, two women, aged around 40, entered the temple this morning
 mahilaon ne kareeb aadhi raat main mandir kii ore chadhaai shuru kii or kareeb 3
 Reached the temple at 45 o'clock
 bhagwaan ayyapa ke darshan karne ke baad ve donon laut gayi
 It is being told that these women were with the police contingent
 pulicekarmi vardi or sade dress main the
 The news agency ANI has also released the video
 iske mutabik, jin do mahilaon ne mandir main pravesh kiya he, usamen se ek kaa naam bindu or duusari mahila kaa naam kanakadurga he
 However, the Sabarimala temple in Kerala was later closed for purification rituals
 vahiin, kerala ke siem pinaraai vijayan ne kaha ki aaj, do mahilaon ne sabarimala mandir main pravesh kiya
 We had issued permanent orders to the police to provide all possible protection to any woman wishing to enter the temple: The Supreme Court on September 28 decided to allow women of all age groups to enter the temple
 Since then Hindu groups in Sabarimala have been continuously protesting against this decision
 unka kahana he ki yah faisla dharmik parampara ke khilaaf he
 On September 28, 2018, the Supreme Court passed the historic verdict allowing women of all ages to enter Kerala's Sabarimala temple
 supreme court ne apane faisle main saaf kaha ki har umr varg kii mahilaayein ab mandir main pravesh kar sakengi
 The Supreme Court had said that the place of woman in our culture is respected
 yahaan mahilaon ko devi kii tarah puja jaataa he or mandir main pravesh se roka ja rahaa he
 This is not acceptable
 jab sara hindustan aakrosh main ji rahaa ho, bhrashtachar, mahangaai, or avyavashtha se log do-do haath kar rahe hon to us samay koi or baat acchhee nahin lagati
 In such an environment, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi gave a strange speech in Rajasthan
 vah ek baar phir bhavuk hue
 By remembering his father and grandmother
 unki shahadat ko unhone ajeebogareeb dhang se pesh kiya or isi bich apni jaan ko khatra bhi bataaya
 His life is in danger, only then he has got the security of z-plus category and the people of Special Protection Group look after his security work
 lekin yah khatra kisase he or kya unki daadi or pita kii hatya main ek hi tarah ke log the? agar nahin to unhen spasht karnaa chahie ki ve koun se log ho sakate hai
 They cannot target anyone just by talking about communal tension
 kisi kii jaan par khatra hona bahut badi baat he or ise saarvajanik sthaan par bataaya janaa yaa to sangeen maamla he yaa saraasar haasyapad
 If Rahul Gandhi's advisory team thinks that he will give them sympathy by making such statements, then it is his misunderstanding
 hinduvadi sanghathanon ke khilaaf rahul gandhi apane bayanon main hameshaa aakraamak rahe hai (yaa unhen aakraamak banaaya jaataa he) lekin unki sarkaar aaj tak tamaam prayaason ke baad bhi unke khilaaf kuch sabit nahin kar pai he
 That is, if the BJP wants to polarize the country, then by making such statements, they are working to add fuel to the fire
 darasal rahul gandhi yah nahin samaj paae hai ki janata main kisi chhavi banaaen
 His advisors do not even want an image of him
 agar aisa nahin he to jab apradhi empi, emele ko bachaane vaale vidheyak kii saream aalochana karke unhone jo sahanubhuti or lokapriyata batori thi use hi aage badhaane kaa kaam karte
 It would have been a good choice
 janata ek aakraamak rahul gandhi ko dekhnaa chaahati he jo apane hi system se lard rahaa he na ki mrityu vilaap karne vaale rahul ko
 She is surrounded by problems and needs an aggressive hero to overcome, not a weak-looking leader who lives in fear
 pradhanmantri narendra modi 20 march ko desh bhar ke asli chaukidaaron se baat karenge
 This conversation will take place at 4:30 pm
 daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki 25 lakh chaukidaaron ko sambodhit kiya jayega
 On March 31, he will also talk to those watchmen who are on Twitter
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki bijepi chaukeedaar vaale abhiyaan ko lekar gambhir he
 So we thought that out of those 25 lakh Chowkidars, tell the condition of 10,000 Chowkidars in Jharkhand in advance, who have not received salary for many months
 kuch zilon main november se selary nahin mili he to kuch zilon main janvari ke baad selary nahin mili he
 Before every festival, it is their news that if salary is not received before Diwali, it will be faded, if you do not get salary before Diwali and Holi, it will be faded
 jharkhand ke sthaneey akhabaaron main chaukidaaron par chhapi in khabaron ko dekhie
 The watchman has become a slave of the police station
 gaanvon main niyukti honi chahie magar inhen bade adhikariyon ke ghar par privet kaam ke liye rakhaa jaataa he
 The dishes are served
 pattey chunavaate hai
 Old news clippings of his performance show that getting salaries on time has been his main demand
 ranchi se 40 kimi dur ratu thana ke baahar kuch chaukeedaar jamaa hue hai
 His salary is 20,000
 magar kabhi samay par nahin miltaa he
 Their question is that when the fake chowkidars i
e
 the Chief Minister and the mlas make their salary on the first date, then why does it take months to get their salary
 1870 main chaukeedaar act bana tha
 On 30 December 1989, the Bihar cabinet declared the chowkidars as class IV employees
 20 disambar 1995 ko lalu yadav kii sarkaar kii cabinet ne ek praavdhaan laayaa ki chaukeedaar ke namit ashrith ko naukari di jaae
 But no one got a job
 23 may 2014 ko jharkhand sarkaar ne aadesh jari kiya ki jin jagahon par chaukidaaron ke ashriton kii niyukti honi he, use sthagit rakhaa jaae
 Since then there has been no appointment of dependents
 yah baat shaayad lalu yadav ko bhi ab yaad na ho
 In every demonstration of the watchmen, there is also a demand that dependents should be appointed
 jharkhand ke chaukeedaar sangh ke adhyaksh krishna dayaal singh ne bataaya ki hoicourt ke aadesh ke anusaar 2015 main ek niyamavali bani thi
 According to which a watchman should be appointed for every 100 to 120 houses
 magar isaki jagah jo chaukeedaar kaam kar rahe the unhen hi hataa diya gaya
 According to Krishna Dayal Singh, militants in rural areas kill Chowkidars but they do not get any compensation
 bihar ke sabhi zilon main ek maheene se chaukidaaron ko vetan nahin mila he
 Many districts have not received salary for two to three months
 madhubani ke jayanagar main paanch maheene se selary nahin mili he
 Salary has not been received in Chhapra also for three months
 bihar main chaukidaaron ko chatursh shrenee kaa mana jaataa he inaki selary 20,000 se shuru hokar 30 hazaar tak hoti he
 Bihar has the highest number of watchmen in Patna and Madhubani
 agar bihar or jharkhand ke chaukidaaron ko selary mil jaae to kam se kam ye log prime time ke naam se bhi holi khel lenge
 At least the government of Bihar and Jharkhand should vow that now that the Prime Minister has become the watchman on Twitter, at least the real Chowkidars should get their salary before the mlas
 ham aapako bataa rahe hai ki netaaon ke chaukeedaar
 
 
 What a difference between playing a watchman and living a life of a watchman in real life
 gaanv kasbon main chaukidaaron kaa jivan kaisaa yah jaan lene main harj nahin
 If this campaign of those who write a catch line for the campaign is to be successful, then the same excuse should also come out in the life of these watchmen
 jin gharon kii suraksha ke liye in chaukidaaron par zimmedaari he unke apane ghar main aisa kuch nahin jisaki chaukeedaari kii jaae
 The door is not even and the roof is also up and down with the wind
 chaukidaaron ke is jivan str ko dekhte hue aap twitor vaale chaukidaaron kaa jivan str dekhie
 SPG security guards, who wish to know about the guards of these houses
 ye ghar un chaukidaaron ke hai jo muradabad ke kundaraki thane main kaam karte hai
 Our effort is to improve their standard of living
 bihar or jharkhand kii tarah in chaukidaaron ko bhi 20,000 se adhik vetan mili
 How would these watchmen work at a salary of 1500 rupees
 thane ke baahar inke kaam kaa haal dekh kar nahin lagata ki inase chaukeedaari ho sakati he
 The body looks weak
 aaj aam ram kishor, sivakumar, bir singh chaukeedaar kii vyathaa suniye
 If possible, make a Twitter account and tag the Prime Minister
 kitna acha hoga ki hamaari vyavastha main jin chaukidaaron kaa bhayankar shoshan ho rahaa he ve twitor par pradhanmantri ke saath tag ho jaaen or kahen ki ham bhi hai chaukeedaar, sun lo hamaari chaukeedaar
 Many years ago we made a documentary about the life of the security guard working in the Delhi metropolis
 yah isliye bataa rahaa taaki aapako yah na lage ki yah campan aayaa to inaki yaad ai
 Rather i know his life, so felt that the campaign was told on the pretext
 shaharon ke security guard kii haalat bahut acchhee nahin he
 The work goes on
 12 se 18 ghante tak khadey hokar naukari karte hai
 If this is enough before the Prime Minister's program of March 31 that all the security agencies take the promise, write that the security guard does not get a day off in the whole month, from now on every security guard gets four holidays in a month If found, this campaign should also be of some benefit
 teen chaar dinon se 'main chaukeedaar hum' abhiyaan chal rahaa he kya aapane dekha ki media main asli chaukidaaron kii haalat par charchaa ho rahi he
 Watching is not an easy task
 upi ke baliya zile ke ek skool kaa haal bataanaa chahta hum taaki chunaav ayog ko yaad rahe ki is chunaav main uski bhi chaukeedaari zaruri he
 You tell yourself it looks like a school or a BJP headquarters
 baliya ke dharhara gaanv ke is sarkari skool ko is tarah se ranga gaya he jaise wo bijepi kaa daftar lage
 It is a primary school
 kai baar chunaavon main aisi jagah matdaan centre banaae jate hai
 Is it clear enough to the principal that the worker was asked to paint with pink and he came out with the wrong color
 paint kaa dibba khul gaya to waapas nahin ho saktaa
 After coloring, it was found that it resembles the BJP flag
 ab aap darshak hi bataaen
 The BJP flag has two colors
 kya mazdoor donon hi galat rang lekar aayaa or yah galat rang bijepi ke jhande se miltaa julata tha
 Only the people of Ballia can tell that such a mistake has been done in only one school or in many schools
 karunaa sindhu ne principal puspa yadav se baat kii ki unka skool bijepi ke jhande jaisaa kyon lagata he
 The villagers say that this is promoting BJP
 bachche skool se laut kar aate hai to kehete hai ki hamaara vidhyalay bhaajapa ke rang main rang gaya he
 When asked, the Additional District Magistrate said that the school would be repainted
 sawaal he ki aachaar samhita lagu hote hi prashasan ne yah kaam khud se kyon nahin kiya
 How did the school survive when the posters on the walls started counting
 chunaav ayog kya kar rahaa he
 Should the officials not be asked questions for this lapse
 ham tak yah jaankaree ek darshak ke zarie pahunchi jo is skool ke bagal se guzar rahe the
 Hopefully by tomorrow the color of this school will be changed
 chaukidaaron ke vetan se prime time shuru hua tha to jharkhand se vetan ko lekar pareshaan ek or tabake kii kahani suna dete hai
 So that you can see under the pretext of these reports what India looks like outside Delhi
 system kii kya haalat he
 67 thousand para teachers of Jharkhand have not received salary since September
 giridih ke para shikshak ravi ranjan sinha ne shiksha prasar adhikari ko patr likhaa he
 They have asked for leave so that they can live by begging
 ravi ranjan sinha 17 saal se ek skool main padhaa rahe hai
 It is written in the letter that now the borrowers also do not give loans
 beemaari main dawa khareednaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 There is no discussion on 67 thousand employees not getting salary for 6 months
 media ne khabar dekhne waalon ko hi khabarviheen bana diya he
 Not getting salary for 67 thousand people is not a news value
 agar yah khabar chhapati bhi he to aisi khabaron kaa koi human vailu nahin he
 The news is published and the government ignores it
 in khabaron kii jagah media main survey ho rahaa he ki kis netaa kii lokapriyata kitni pratishat he
 Behind the number of a survey, the number of millions of people suffering becomes zero
 in sabko aakhri baar pichley saal sitambar main vetan mila tha
 Last year you will remember that on 15 November, mercury teachers were charged in Ranchi
 sainkadon paara shikshakon ko jail janaa padaa
 Our colleague Harbans has been told by department officials that there is no money to pay salaries
 sarkaar se 200 karod kii maang kii gai he magar paisa nahin aayaa he
 Democratic values in India are becoming far and away from the TV world

 jundaal ne jawaab diya ki is masale par use apane mata-pita se charchaa kerani hogi

 dinesh patidaar (53 varsh ) chairman, shakti pampsakabhi padhai karne ke dauraan kamjor aarthik sthiti ke kaaran sabji bechney ko majaboor hue dinesh patidaar aaj hindustan kii nami company shakti pamps ke chairman or managing diarector hai
 Because of poverty, they b
 com kii padhai bhi puri nahin kar paae the lekin aaj ve us company ke maalik hai jo 100 deshon main pump export karti he
 The foundation of this company in Industrial Area Pithampur of Indore was laid in 1982 by Manohar Lal Patidar, father of Dinesh Patidar, who was a farmer and wanted to work for the betterment of farmers
 yahi vajah thi ki unhone pump kaa kaarobaar karne kaa man banaaya or pump nirmaan kaa kaarkaana kholaa
 In 1986, his son Dinesh Patidar took over the reins
 jis vakt dinesh ne kaarobaar sambhala, is company kaa rajasav 12 lakh ru
 Was
 teen dashak main unhone kaarobaar ko 335 karod ru
 Delivered to dinesh bataate hai ki unhen is mukaam tak pahunchane main kai logon kaa yogadan rahaa he lekin madhya pradesh sarkaar kii mahatvapurn bhoomika ko ve khaas taur se yaad karte hai
 He explains, "in 1986, i received Rs 9 lakh from Madhya Pradesh Finance Corporation
 kii madad mili
 This amount helped me a lot in moving the business forward
 " kaarobaar ko badhaane kii khatir dinesh ne 1995 main ipio ke jariye apni company ke liye 5 karod ru
 Raised from the capital market
 yahi vah vakt tha jab em
 s
 shoej or harshad mehta jaise dalal kii vajah se bazaar par se aam logon kaa bharosa uth gaya tha
 But people showed confidence in Dinesh's IPO
 agle saal hi company ne videshon main apane utpaada bechney shuru kiye or sabase pehle dubai main maal export kiya
 Today the company also has offices in Dubai, Australia and USA
 dinesh spasht karte hai, "ham khud kisaan rahe hai
 Who could know the pain of farmers more than us
 is anubhav se ham khud bhi gujarey hai
 If the farmer is not able to water his crop on time, then his entire crop dries up
 isliye hameshaa se hamaari koshish kisaanon ke liye aisa pump banane kii thi jocum bijli main pani upaladbradh karvaa paata ho
 "one measure of the company's success is that in 1987 Madhya Pradesh had 20 small scale industries, 18 of which have closed today
 lekin shakti pamps na sirf maujuud he balki safalataa ke nae aayam bhi tay kar rahi he
 Dinesh says, "vision, clarity and the extent of insanity is passion for success
 "dinesh hameshaa aise pump banane kii takanic kii khoj main to rahete hi hai jisamen bijli kaa istemaal kam se kam ho, saath hi ve saura urja ke istemaal kii disha main bhi kadam badhanaa chaah rahe hai
 In the advertisement of Shakti Pumps Company, famous actor Amitabh Bachchan is seen showing the benefits of this pump
 dinesh bataate hai, ''amitabh bachchan hamaare product kaa vigyaapan karenge, yah faisla maine nirama company ke pramukh karsan bhai patel se mulaakaat ke baad liya tha
 "actually, the place where there is Shakti Pumps Company in Pithampur, there used to be factory of Nirma Company
 dinesh ne yah jameen kharid lee
 During the conversation, when Dinesh told Karsan Patel that he produces the best pumps in the country, Patel told him that he never even heard the name of Shakti pump
 yaheen karsan bhai ne dinesh ko mahatvapurn salaah di
 He said, "if you make the best product, then it is important that the way of telling people about it should also be the best
 '' unhone soch liya tha ki ve apane utpaada kii jaankaree film industry ke sabase nami abhinaytaon main se ek amitabh bachchan ke jariye logon tak pahunchaayenge
 According to Dinesh, the brand value of the company has increased due to Bachchan being in the advertisement
 ek bete or ek beti ke pita dinesh ko unke parijan kabhi sakht to kabhi naram mizaaj vaala vyakti maanate hai
 Dinesh, who reaches office at exactly 9 in the morning, is sure to come to office but not to return home
 kuch saal pehle jab ve panpon kii dizin par kaam kar rahe the to aadhi raat ko ghar pahunchate the or subah hote hi phir se daftar nikal jate the
 In his office, he has put a picture of his father Manohar Lal Patidar, which fills him with new energy
 ve kehete hai, ''kaam karne kii prerana pitaaji ne hi di he
 i could not have reached this point without his guidance
 ''dinesh ke 27 varshiya bete ankit apane pita ke nakshe-kadam par chalate hue company kii marketing kaa jimmaa sambhaal rahe hai
 His wife Indira handles corporate-social Responsibility (CSR) of the company
 ve bataati hai, ''company ne siesaar ke tahat rangavasa ke skool ko god liya he
 Rangwasa is the ancestral village of Dinesh
 iske alaava company kai garib bacchon kii ejineering kii fees bhi detii he
 The company has a trust called Shakti Foundation, under which it works in the fields of health, water and education
 shakti pamps ne kai sthanon par kisaanon kii madad ke liye solar pump bhi lagaae hai
 Today Shakti Pumps is producing more than 260 pumps of designs and their consumers include many companies from abroad
 iske saath hi yah desh kii pehali aisi company he jisane 100 fisadi steneles steel panpon kaa nirmaan shuru kiya he

 The Supreme Court will take a decision on whether the matter of admission of women of 10 to 50 years in the Sabarimala temple in Kerala should be referred to the Constitution Bench or not
 maamle kii sunwaayee saat november ko hogi
 The Kerala government and the temple trust said in a bench of Justice Deepak Mishra that the matter should be referred to the Constitution Bench
 isse pehle supreme court ne kaha tha ki mahilaon par ye bain kaise lagaaya ja saktaa he jabaki mahila or purush ke bich aisa koi bhedbhaav veda, upanishad yaa kisi shaastra main nahin he

 However, the temple board said that this practice has been going on for a thousand years

 The Supreme Court bench hearing the case has asked the temple board and the government when the entry of women into Sabarimala was closed

 On Rahul Gandhi's remarks that Narendra Modi had quit making the people 'owls', the BJP retaliated by saying that the Congress vice-president has started making derisive statements containing bizarre nouns in frustration over the past few days in view of the possible defeat in the election
 bhaajapa ne kaha ki ek ore uske pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi janata se sarokaar rakhane vaale vikaas, arthvyavastha, berajgari or manhagaai jaise mudde uthaa rahe hai, to duusari ore rahul or congress kaa sheersh netritv unka jawaab dene kii bajaay 'ullu' or 'toffee' jaisi vicitra sangyaae dene laga he
 The party said that it was the same as no ignorant teacher started talking here and there when the students' questions were not answered
 rajyasabha main netaa pratipaksh arun jetali ne kaha, matadaata agar congress ko satta se bedakhal karne ke liye matdaan karata he, to vah 'ullu' nahin he
 a leader should not give up decency after seeing defeat in front
 jo log congress ko vot nahin de rahe hai, uske kuch kaaran honge
 The angry voter is not a four letter word that Rahul has used for him
 party ke pravaktaa sudhanshu trivedi ne kaha, rahul kaa bayaan darshata he ki vah sarthak muddon ke divaaliepan ke saath saath shabdon ke bauddhik divaaliepan tak panhuch gaye hai
 He alleged that the Congress leadership made a lot of efforts to raise the issue of communalism after Modi's development and good governance issues were relegated to the front, but that too did not succeed
 unhone kaha ki congress ke netaa kabhi bhaajapa ke netaaon ke nijee jivan par tippanee karte hai, to kabhi ul-julul baaten karne lagate hai, jo is baat kaa pramaan he ki ve puri tarah niruttar ho chuke hai

 In the case of Muzaffarnagar riots, the UP government suspended five Thanaprabharis
 pulisavaalon kaa aarope he ki yah nilamban upi ke mantri ajam khan ke ishaare par kiya gaya tha
 These policemen also alleged that seven people who were accused of killing two Jats and one Muslim boy were released from custody following pressure from Azam Khan
 kaha ja rahaa tha ki isi vajah se ilaake main dange bhadke the
 50 people were killed and about 45 thousand people were displaced in these riots
 court ne kaha ki nilamban ke aadesh main durvyavhaar kaa jo aarope lagaaya gaya he vah uchit nahin lagata, isse maatr yahi pataa lagata he ki ye police vaale dangon ke samay or kargar dhang se nipat sakate the
 At the same time, the court said that the allegations which are being leveled against the UP minister are very serious and if the entire episode is considered, the reasons behind this order should be considered
 is par yah bhi dekha janaa jaruri he ki kanoon kaa paalan hua he yaa nahin

 The farewell of Ramlal, who served as the organization's general secretary for the last 13 years in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is in the news
 sangh ne 2006 main unhen bijepi main bheja tha or ab phir waapas bulaakar akhil bhartiya sah sampark pramukh banaaya he
 There is a talk of Ramlal's height in the political corridor
 magar, bijepi or aresas kii raajnneeti se jude sutara aisa nahin maanate hai
 He says that Ramlal's glamor may be reduced if bjp's organization is removed from the post of General Secretary and as before, there will be no direct connection with ordinary workers and office bearers, but the post of All India Co-liaison Head in the Sangh is very important
 unka rutaba barkaraar rahegaa
 The person who holds this post does not stay inside the union but outside it extends the subsidiary organizations
 uskaa kaam ahm logon se sampark kar aresas ke liye unki madad hasil karnaa kaa hota he
 Sources say that only those who understand the working of the Sangh can understand the importance of this post
 13 saal se bhi adhik samay tak raamalaal ke ek hi pad par bane rahane se unke daayitv main parivartan tay mana ja rahaa tha
 Finally, at a meeting of province campaigners in Vijayawada on 11 to 13 July, it was decided to remove him from bjp's organization general secretary and give new responsibility to the Sangh
 sanghathan mahaamantri pad se raamalaal ko hataane kii baat par sangh ke ek prachaarak kehete hai," kya aap chaahate hai ki koi aaajeevan bijepi main ek hi pad par bana rahe
 It is not a change, but a change of liability
 yah to ek swaabhaavik prakriya he
 "the Sangh's strategists will expand the Sangh's 36 organizations with contacts with the BJP
 In recent years, among the allied organizations in the 'sangh Parivar', the BJP has expanded its political arm the most
 yah digar he ki sangh ek ranneeti ke tahat saarvajanik rup se bijepi ko apni raajnneetik shakha nahin maanata
 The other 36 subsidiary organizations of the Sangh are lagging behind the BJP in terms of expansion and strength
 aise main sangh ab anya 36 sanghathanon ko bhi bijepi ke samanaantar laane kii koshish main he
 So that the crisis of balance does not arise in the Sangh Parivar
 sangh kaa maananaa he ki aresas main hi puri jindagi bitaa dene vaala koi prachaarak utane karine se yah kaam nahin kar saktaa, jitna ki bijepi main rahakar bade-bade sampark rakhane vaala prachaarak
 Because the resources and funds needed for the work of all other organizations including Seva Bharati, Swadeshi Jagran Manch of the Sangh are also needed
 is paimaane par aresas kii najar main raamalaal hi feet baithe
 RSS sources aajtak
 inko bataaya ki 13 varshon se bijepi main bade ohade par rahete hue raamalaal kii bijepi ke kendriya mantriyon, mukhyamantriyon se lekar beuroperesi or vyapaar aadi kshetron ke pramukh vyaktiyon se achche sampark bane hai
 In such a situation, knowing their 'utility value', the RSS wants to take advantage of this in the expansion of the organizations of the Sangh
 sangh ke ek sutara ne udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki agar seva bharti ke kisi project ke liye dhanrashi or anya sansadhano kii jarurat ho to raamalaal ke kah dene maatr se kendriya mantri, mukhyamantri yaa anya prabhaavshaalee log korporate soshal rispansbility se bandobast kar sakate hai
 Whereas other campaigners may not say so much difference
 nagpur ke sangh vichaarak dilip devdhar kehete hai, 'mujhe to lagata he ki sangh raamalaal ko aaj kaa nanaaji deshmukh bananaa chahta he
 Nanaji made a big recognition with service works in places like Chitrakoot, now the Sangh wants Ramlal to further the social work of Nana through the Sangh's subsidiary organizations
 'govindacharya, joshi se alag he maamalaramlaal kii bijepi ke sanghathan mahaamantri pad se vidaai ko ek dhada keen govindacharya or sanjay joshi kii vidaai se bhi jodakar dekh rahaa he, jabaki aresas sutron kaa kahana he ki raamalaal kaa maamla puri tarah alag he
 KN Govindacharya had to step down due to differences with Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 vaajapeyi ko unhone bijepi kaa mukhauta kah diya tha
 After which Vajpayee had clearly told the Sangh that he did not want to see Govindacharya in BJP
 baad main adwani ne bhi vaajapeyi kaa samarthan kiya tha
 At the same time, Sanjay Joshi also had to leave the post of organization general secretary after the alleged sex cds surfaced in 2005
 jiske baad se donon diggaj na sangh main kisi bhoomika main dikhe or na hi bijepi main unki vaapasi hui
 Till date there are edges from BJP and Sangh
 jabaki bijepi mahaamantri pad se hataae jane ke baad bhi raamalaal ko sangh main ahm jimmedaari se nawaja gaya he
 It is clear that Ramlal's relevance will remain in the Sangh and the BJP
 sampark pramukh kaa kaam hi sangh or duusare sanghathanon se lekar bahari vyaktiyon ko jodne kaa he
 Why Ramlalramlal became All India co-head, why did he not become the co-liaison, why did he not become the liaison head? yah bhi sawaal uchhal rahaa he
 RSS sources say that appointments to key posts are made only at the meeting of the House of Representatives in March
 aresas ke samvidhan ke mutabik niyukti ho jane par bich main hataaya nahin jaataa, balki aagaamee baithak main hi koi nirnay hota he
 Since the current All India Liaison Head is Anirudh Deshpande
 aise main sah prumakh ke taur par raamalaal ko sangh main samyojit kiya gaya
 RSS sources say that Ramlal may be made the All India Liaison Head at a meeting of the House of Representatives in March next year
 sangh main pad nahin vyavastha chalati he, charchit he rajju bhaiya kaa kesanagpur ke sangh vichaarak dilip devdharxjthak
 It is said from in that there is no post in the union
 isse judaa vah ek rochak vakya bataate hai
 He says that Balasaheb Deoras was then the head of the union
 rajju bhaiya ko unhone apana dipti yani sarkarywah banaaya tha
 Meanwhile, in 1987, Rajju Bhaiya handed over his post of head stewardship to HV Seshadri and himself became his colleague ie Sah Sah sir
 is par aresas main hangaamaa much gaya ki kaise rajju bhaiya apane junior ko hi apane upar baitha rahe hai
 On this, the then Union chief Deoras also expressed his displeasure with Rajju Bhaiya and asked who gave you the right to make this appointment
 is par rajju bhaiya ne kaha tha ki sangh ke samvidhan main sarkarywah hi kaaryakari pramukh hota he, jabaki sangh pramukh kii bhoomika maardarshak kii hoti he
 Rajju Bhaiya had told Deoras- You and we are both running sick, so an energetic pracharak should be number two in the Sangh
 tab jaakar devaras raji hue
 The message was conveyed by Rajju Bhaiya's decision that no position in the Sangh is small, big, responsibility is big
 jise ham pad samajhate hai, vah vyavastha hoti he
 If a general worker has got a big responsibility, then he is also more important than the union official sitting in the important post

 With the fiscal deficit crossing the target in November itself, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has indicated further cuts in spending, keeping it within a narrow range for the current financial year
 unhone kaha ki unhen udhaar ke dhan se kaam chalaane main koi bharosa nahin he
 He said through video conferencing to the industrialists and planners present in Mumbai, as far as the government is concerned, we are trying to rationalize the expenditure, as we do not want the government to operate indefinitely with borrowed funds
 unhone kaha, apni aay se zyada kharch karne or karj chukaane kaa jimmaa agali peedi par chhod dene kii puri avadharana (ke aadhaar par hi) par aaj jarurat se zyada kharch kar rahe hai, lekin yah kabhi bhi vivekpurna rajkoshiya niti nahin he
 Jaitley also indicated further reductions in addition to a 10 percent reduction in expenditure, which was announced by the government to propose fiscal deficit in the budget 4
 1 pratishat ke lakshya ko praapt karne ke liye kii thi
 However, this target has been exceeded in November for four months from the current financial year ending on 31 March

 com / khvd4dl7jg— Salman Khan (@beingsalmankhan)december 29, 2018 Barren fields, dying cattle, uninhabited villages
 teen saal ke sookhe kii maar sahane ke baad maharashtra kii adhiktar zamin kuch yahi manzar dikhaa rahi he
 But even in this disaster in Beed, a state badly hit by drought, vicious people have found ways to fill their pockets
 yahaan tak ki maweshiyon ke chaare ko bhi nahin chhod rahe
 An India Today investigation has revealed how some ngos are ditching government funds to provide relief to cattle-owning farmers
 india today ke under cover reporter ne jaanch main paaya ki rajya ke pashudhan campon main gaayon ke chaare kii aapurti ke liye nirdhaarit enjio kaise is kaam main herapheri se apni or apane raajnneetik aakaaon kii jeben garm kar rahe hai
 In early March this year, the Maharashtra government had announced to start such facilities where farmers can avail support for their cattle feed
 adhikariyon ke mutabik june tak kareeb 1,635 chaara camp banaae gaye the, taaki 11 lakh maweshiyon kii madad kii ja sake
 Livestock assistance is between Rs 50 and Rs 100 per 9 to 18 kg per cattle
 ek suvidha centre main agar ek hajaar maweshiyon ko handle kiya jaae to ye raashi ek lakh rupye pratidin baithti he
 The India Today investigation revealed that many institutions associated with these facility camps are managed on behalf of BJP and Shiv Sena leaders or their confidants
 aise kuch santhaan chhadam naamon se bhi chalaae jate hai
 Surprisingly, these institutions describe themselves as running on the non-profit principle
 gram panchayat ke sadsy or shivasena se jude ganesh vaaghmare par bid jile ke kalsambar main chaara camp chalaane kii zimmedaari he
 Waghmare confessed that fodder and cattle are given less fodder in papers to establish a drought relief site
 vaaghmare ne under cover reporter ko bataaya, 'saare adhikariyon ke liye rakam tay he
 i can provide any letter or record
 maine unhen (maweshiyon) ek din ke liye bhi supplement nahin die, ek chutki bhi nahin
 18 kg of fodder is prescribed for big cattle and 9 kg for small cattle but i give 12 and 6 kg only
 'vaaghmare ne record dikhaae ki kaise chaare kii khapat ko kagaz par badhaakar dikhaaya jaataa he
 Waghmare said, 'I have kept people to sign on the official register and see that every sign has a thumb impression
 99% pratishat kisaan nirakshar hai
 'investigation revealed that local leaders like Waghmare have built 10 to 15 camps and have shown the names of villagers as partners in official files
 lagbhag aisa hi tarika har gaanv main apanaaya jaataa he
 In Aher Wadgaon, Mukung Rohite confessed that books were regularly manipulated to settle the fund of cattle relief in the camps operated on his behalf
 rohite ne kaha, “ham jo register mentin karte hai usamen aankadon ko badha chadha kar dikhaaya jaataa he
 We also do videography
 hamen dikhaanaa hota he ki har parivaar main chaar se paanch sadsy hai or har sadsy ke paas paanch maveshi hai to puure parivaar ke hisaab se 20 maveshi baithte hai
 "rohite also agreed to bribe the inspectors who came for checking
 rohite ne ye bhi daawa kiya ki maharashtra sarkaar main ek mantri bhi aisi suvidha kaa apane phaayde ke liye beja istemaal kar rahaa he
 India Today has full confession of Rohitay

 jiestike liye november maheenaa kai myanon main khaas he
 In the GST Council meeting to be held in Guwahati on 10 November, the Council will take its decision on several important suggestions
 isamen petrol-dijal ko jiesti ke tahat laane par bhi vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Several people, including oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan, including Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, are demanding that petrol and diesel be brought under GST
 guwahati main hogi baithak10 november ko guwahati menvitt mantri arun jetaliki adhyakshata main jiesti parishad kii 23veen baithak honi he
 In this meeting, the composition of the composition scheme was increased from 1 crore to 1
 50 karod turnover karne par faisla liya ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, the 18% GST levied on AC restaurants can be reduced to 12%
 sabhi rajya hai taiyaaris meeting mempetrol-dijal ko jiestike tahat laane par bhi vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Almost all the states have agreed to bring fuel under GST
 maharashtra ke vitt mantri sudhir munagatiwar ne bataaya he ki sabhi rajyon ne petrol-dijal ko jiesti ke daayre main laane kii anumati de di he
 According to him, now we have to wait for the right time to bring these products under it
 maharashtra siem bhi de chuke hai sujhavakuch din pehlemaharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvisane bhi ajtak ke mumbai manthan kaarykram main petrol-dijal ko jiesti ke tahat laane kaa suzav diya tha
 In such a situation, the GST Council can also take an important decision regarding petrol and diesel in this meeting
 28 fisadi jiesti lagane par ye hogi keembgar petrol-dijal ko jiesti ke daayre main laayaa jaataa he, to is par zyada se zyada 28 fisadi tex lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Because this is the highest tax slab in GST
 28 fisadi tex vasule jane par ek litre petrol aapako dilli main kareeb 43 rupee main padegaa
 Which is about half of the current price of petrol
 khatm ho jayega exise or vaidgar petrol jiesti ke tahat aa jaataa he, to exise duty or rajyon kii taraf se lagane vaala waite khatm ho jayega
 Under the new tax policy, after adding the dealer commission, the price of one liter of petrol 33
 66 rupye ho jaati he
 To add 28 percent GST to it, you get 9
 42 rupee or dene honge
 In this way you get 43 liters of 1 liter petrol in Delhi
 08 rupee main milegaa
 Talking about one liter diesel diesel will be Rs 41, then it will be 32 after adding dealer commission
 15 rupee ho jaataa he
 If GST is added to it, then 9
 02 rupee or judega
 In this way 1 liter diesel will give you only 41
 17 rupee main milegaa
 Crude oil prices will come down
 If petrol and diesel come under GST, then their prices will be reduced to half of the current prices
 isse antarrashtriya str par keemton main badlaav hone par bhi aam aadmi kii jeb par zyada dabaav nahin padegaa

 Announcing the start of a new movement against corruption, Anna Hazare and former army chief General VK Singh termed the UPA government as unconstitutional and criticized its decisions like allowing foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail
 anna hajaare or general wike singh ke sanyukt samvaadadaata sammelan se saaf jhalak mil rahi thi ki wike singh ne puraani team anna ke arvind kejariwal kaa sthaan le liya he
 During the conference, Singh answered many questions asked by Anna and told about the new policies of the anti-corruption movement

 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii grah dasha thik nahin chal rahi
 After getting upset with the BJP, he started making statements against Narendra Modi
 unka sara samay modi kii aalochana main hi bitta rahaa lekin jab rajya main lau and order kii haalat bigadani shuru hui to unki lokapriyata teji se ghatane lagi
 And now after Lalu Prasad gets out of jail, an old challenge is facing him in a new form
 ab nitish kumaar ke saamne ek or majboot pratidwandvi khadaa he
 Till now he was happy leaving his satirical arrows on Narendra Modi, but now he will have to face the thorny arrows of Lalu Prasad daily
 bhale hi ranchi kii jail se nikalate hi lalu prasad ne sampradayik takaton se do-do haath karne kaa elaan kiya ho, lekin unki nigahen patliputra par hi hai
 And Nitish knows this very well
 lekin nitish kumaar jis sushasan ke naare ke saath bihar main satta main aae the, vah taar-taar hota dikh rahaa he
 The law and order situation in the state is bad
 uske kul 38 jilon main se 16 naksali hinsa ke shikaar hai or kai ilaakon main to police vaale bhi jane se darate hai
 He is angry with the letter of Home Minister Shinde on this issue, in which he has been accused of being lax in this case
 shaayad nitish kumaar ko lag rahaa tha ki narendra modi kii baar-baar aalochana se khush kendra kii congress sarkaar unase kuch nahin kahegi
 But the center is very angry with the way the Maoists openly killed the police personnel and looted their weapons
 unke virodhiyon kaa aarope he ki nitish kumaar lokapriyata ghatane kii dar se naksal virdohi abhiyaanon main dilchaspee nahin le rahe hai
 Campaigns against Naxalites put the villagers in a lot of trouble
 vot kii raajnneeti tamaam mukhyamantriyon ko aise kadam uthaane se rokatii he or nitish kumaar koi apwaad nahin hai
 The way the Indian Mujahideen strengthened its roots in Bihar is a gift of the state government itself
 intelligence beuro kii salaah ke baad bhi vahaan kii police ne koi kadam nahin uthaaya
 Actually, Nitish Kumar did not want any kind of controversy in trying to turn minorities towards himself
 nateeja narendra modi kii sabha main hue dhamaake ke rup main dikhaa jisamen kai begunaahon kii jaane gayi
 But Nitish Kumar did not mind and kept making statements
 iem ke kai aatankwaadiyon kaa pardaafash hone ke baad bhi unhen koi fark nahin padaa
 The rising crime in the state is hollowing out their claims of good governance
 unka saamana karne kii bajaay ve bayaanbaji kaa hi sahaara le rahe hai
 He feels that this will keep his image impeccable
 lekin aisa ho nahin rahaa
 People are now asking the government questions
 bijepi se naata todane ke baad nitish kumaar ke paas ab itane mantralayon kaa kaary bhaar he ki ve kuch nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Work in the state is getting stalled
 ab lalu prasad kii jail se vaapasi unke liye narendra modi se bhi bada sirdard sabit hogi
 Nitish Kamar is well aware that Lalu was once the favorite of the minorities
 jail se lautakar vah nitish kumaar ke vot bank par "daaka" daalane kaa prayaas sabase pehle karenge
 The danger of getting away from the minority vote for which he withdrew from the BJP is now in front
 dilli se biarti kii vidaai tay si ho gai he
 Ever since the BRT Corridor built between Khanpur to Moolchand, there has been opposition
 chah kimi se bhi kam duuri ke is galiyare ko janaa to kashmiri get tak tha magar vahaan tak galiyara gaya hi nahin
 Whenever protest arises, it should be ended with this demand
 is baat ke saath nahin ki ise sudhara jaae
 This explains the history of BRT in Delhi between 2008 and 2014
 is puure virodh kii buniyaad main car banaam bas hi tha lekin ab jab virodh kamyaabi ke kareeb pahunch chukaa he yah daleel di ja rahi he ki ise car banaam bas kaa mudda mat banaaiye
 No leader has shown the will power to make BRT a success
 dilli main biarti kii shuruuaat agar dakshin dilli se na hui hoti to shaayad aaj isaki sthiti kuch or hoti
 Then nobody even knows what is happening in BRT
 yahaan ke rasukhwale kaarchaalakon kii awaz bas waalon se kahin zyada he
 But before finishing it, one should think what is the basic purpose of BRT and similar schemes
 yahi na ki saarvajanik parivahan pranali kaa vistaar ho
 It is agreed across the world that different types of public transport should be developed so that the city's dependence on cars can be reduced
 kaaron ne hamaare shahar ko leel liya he
 Cars are important, but will something become so important that we will fill the entire earth with it? dilli ke gali mohalle main chale jaaiye, parking ko lekar tanaav failaa hua he
 As soon as they remove the car in front of the house, they place stones there so that they can return in the evening and park their car
 gharon ke baahar board lage hai ki get ke saamne car park hone par shishe tod diye jaaenge yaa tair panchar kar diya jayega
 This is when the width of roads in Delhi is more than the roads of many big cities of the world
 america or landan kii tulana main dilli main prati hazaar aabaadi par kaaron kii sankhya behad kam he tab bhi yahaan jam ne bhayankar samasya kaa rup le liya he
 This problem is not limited to Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Pune, but even in the middle level cities, the jam has taken the form of catastrophic crisis
 jam ke kaaran ham rose kaa teen se chaar ghanta sadak par bitaa rahe hai
 One is that the time is less due to the pressure of work, the second is due to being stuck in a jam, there is no time left for the family or even for ourselves
 agar aap iskaa hisaab karenge tab jaakar samaj paaenge ki kyon saarvajanik parivahan pranali kii baat kii ja rahi he
 This car has given us social status but has ruined our social life
 is samasya se bachane ke liye kai saare upaay aajamaaye jate hai
 Somewhere there is car pooling, somewhere the number of cars are decided to run, and somewhere flyovers are being built in a different way
 tab bhi jam kam nahin ho rahe hai
 The flyover has been associated with the flyover, the flyover above the flyover has been seen but the jam has not been freed
 metro ne bahut had tak logon ko saarvajanik parivahan pranali kii aadat to daali he magar wo itnaa mahangaa he ki sabko lekar nahin chal sakati
 The time taken to construct the metro is certainly much longer
 isliye zaruri he ki metro ke alaava bason ko badhaava diya jaae
 BRT became a good option to promote buses
 dilli main shuru se virodh hota rahaa magar ahmedabad main chupchaap yah kaamyaab hota rahaa
 It is not that the BRT of Ahmedabad does not have problems, but there the government showed the will power
 aaj ahmedabad main 80 se 90 kimi biarti galiyare kaa vistaar ho chukaa he jabaki dilli main 6 kimi bhi puraa nahin ho sakaa
 The experiment, which began twenty years ago in a city in Brazil, is proving to be an effective supplement to public transport
 poorak isliye kaha ki biarti apane aap main samaadhaan nahin he
 Where there is no metro, you take a bus, where there is no bus, you take mono rail and go by car where it is necessary
 duniya ke kai deshon main kaaron kii parking fees mahangi kii gai he
 Being discouraged not to leave the car
 iske liye public transport ko behatar kiya ja rahaa he
 Parking fees are being expensive in Delhi but public transport is not known
 yahaan tak ki ditisi ke paas apni bason ko park karne ke liye jagah nahin he
 For this, he has to encroach the river Yamuna
 landan aaj ek arab pound kharch kar rahaa he ki log cycle chalaane ke liye protsaahit hon
 Even after spending so much, there are no five percent cyclists while in Delhi more than 30 percent people ride bicycles
 lekin kya kabhi aapane in cycle waalon kii awaz suni he? kisi sarkaar ne inkaa paksh liya he? cycle ke liye trek banane kaa gambhir prayaas kiya he? We give all the emphasis to the car
 ham maan chuke hai ki car se hi growth he lekin jin deshon main saarvajanik parivahan pranali kaa vikaas ho rahaa he vahaan car virdohi morcha nahin khulaa he
 Cars are also being sold there
 dilli main bahut se log shaukia cycle yatra par nikalne lage hai
 Many of my friends take long distance cycling in Delhi on Sunday
 agar madhyamvarg car mukt shahari vaataavaran ke khilaaf hota to kanat place main rahgeeri safal nahin hoti
 Passenger is not spread in Connaught Place as well as many other cities of the country
 rahgeeri kaa safal hona bataata he ki log car se ukta gaye hai lekin car chhodkar ghar se nikalne ke vikalp kam hai
 It is not the fault of the people but the government
 agar wo saarvajanik parivahan pranali kaa network banaaegi to log car ke vikalpon kaa bhi istamaal karenge
 One day will go by bicycle, one day by bus and one day by metro and other days by car
 sarkaar samajhati he ki car main baithe log bason ke liye alag galiyare ke khilaaf hai
 This is also true, but why should it be understood
 dilli shahar ko jam se bachaane ke alaava apane nijee jivan ke liye kuch samay bachaana he to biarti jaise vikalpon ke bare main sochna chahie
 Why BRT was adopted in Beijing city? kyon aaj duniya main biarti ke 160 galiyare hai
 Buses and cyclists benefited greatly in the part of South Delhi where BRT is located
 unki sankhya badi he
 Since this corridor is so small that they too sometimes feel that it is of no use
 biarti ke galiyare se nikalate hi ve usee jam main fanse nazar aate hai
 The same experience would dominate their perception
 biarti kii apni dikkate hai par kya saamaanya sadakon kii dikkatein nahin hai
 If the jam did not go away from the flyover, did we stop making money on it
 biarti kii baat band karne ke liye hi kyon hoti he
 Recall that last scene in the 1957 Dilip Kumar film Naya Daur
 us film main bas ghodagadee se haar gai thi, dilli main ek baar bas phir haar gai he
 This time with a car, not with a bullock cart
 bas waalon kii niyati hi haarane kii he

 bhartiya vayusena ne ravivaar ko apane twitor handle par ek kavita saajha kar abhinandan(abhinandan Varthaman) ke hausale ko naman kiya he

 kavita kii kuch panktiyaan yun hai- 'sabake bas kii baat nahin jo kiya tumne abhinandan, vah sabake bas kii baat nahin
 The game of the game was done, it is not a question of everyone
 janani, janmabhumi kaa gaurav ho tum, sarvocch shikhar par tumhen bithaate hai
 What you have been able to do in one life, it is not for everyone
 aapako bataa den ki do din pehle bhi airforce ne ek kavita saajha kii thi
 Through this poem, Pakistan has been warned in gestures
 sabake bas kii baat nahin Whatever you did, vah sabake bas kii baat nahin
 The game was shot yah sabake bas kii baat nahin
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Janani, you are the pride of your birthplace, sarvocch shikhar par tumhen bithaate hai
 That you could do in one life, vah sabake bas kii baat nahin

 In that fighter, which means mrigamarichika, we had a real, gone night
 aaj kisi ne sarahadein paar kii
 
 
 Let me tell you that yesterday the Ministry of External Affairs had said that the Pakistan Air Force fighter aircraft F-16 was dropped by the Indian Air Force (IAF) fighter aircraft mig-21 Bison and for this the witnesses as well as electronic evidence Are also
 mig-21 ko wing commander abhinandan vardhman(abhinandan Varthaman) uda rahe the
 The ministry said that there is also evidence of Pakistan's use of F-16 aircraft and the Amram missile and pieces of aircraft and missiles were recovered from the spot
 aapako bataa den ki jammu-kashmir main hue pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad 26 farvari ko bharat ne pakistani sarajameen par pal rahe jaish ke aatanki thikaanon par hamalaa bolaa tha
 The Indian Air Force dropped 1000 kg bombs at jaish-e-mohammed's terrorist camp in Balakot, Pakistan
 isamen kaaphi aatankiyon ke maare jane kii baat saamne ai
 India used about 12 Mirage fighter jets and rained 1000 kg of bombs
 iske baad pakistan kii baukhalaahat saamne aane lagi or usne bharat ke daawey ko khaarij karne kii koshish kii
 On the very next day of Indian Air Force action, Pakistani fighter ships were trying to enter the Indian border
 IAF ne iskaa munhtod jawaab diya
 Air Force Wing Commander Abhinandan (abhinandan Varthaman) entered the Pakistan border while chasing the Pakistani Air Force fighter plane at around 10 am on 27 February
 pakistan ke epa-16 ko maar giraane ke baad abhinandan kaa vimaan bhi krash ho gaya
 Because of this he had to get off with the help of parachute somehow
 baad main kareeb 60 ghante baad pakistan ne unhen reeha kiya
 Regarding pollution, the Delhi government has decided to implement odd-even from 13 November
 vahiin dilli main od-ivan lagu karne ko lekar kejariwal sarkaar or engiti main takaraar bad gai he
 The court has decided to review this rule
 saath hi engiti ne dilli sarkaar ko fatkaar lagaate hue kaha ki ham aapako is tarah od-ivan ko lagu nahin karne de sakate, isse pradooshan kam nahin hona balki or badhegaa
 Not only this, the Delhi government is also going to get a challenge from the Private Transporters Association
 privet transporter vehical association ditisi or cluster bason main free seva kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 He has said that private commercial vehicles will be removed from Delhi's roads from November 13 to 17 if their demands are not met
 unka kaha he ki agar sarkaribasen freehongi to privet vehical par koun sawari karegaa
 a letter has also been written to the Delhi government regarding this
 ab aapako bataa den ki dilli main kareeb 8600 nijee karmshal vaahan chalate hai
 Delhi 850 RTV buses, 400 metro feeder bus service, 100 maxicab service, 6000 rural service, 600 instant service and 650 eco friendly service
 yah dilli ke logon kaa safar aasaan karti hai, lekin association ne sabhi vaahanon ko hataane kii dhamkee bhi de di he
 Shyam Lal Gola, spokesperson of Private Transporters Vehicle Association, has demanded that the government 1350 buses including RTV buses, maxicab service and Metro feeder service
 , unako ditisi skim ke tahat laayaa jaae
 The government should pay per kilometer so that they do not suffer from free service
 duusare karmshal nijee vaahan jaise gramin seva, fatafat seva or iko friendli seva ko sarkaar anudaan kare, taaki od ivan main ye bhi bade str par sahyog kar saken
 DTC itself is going through a crisis of low buses, with only around 4000 dtcbus and 1600 cluster buses on the roads
 jarurat ke hisaab se pehle hi kam hai
 The Delhi government has demanded 500 buses from the private operator, where the government will get 500 more buses in Aud Even, while 8600 private vehicles will be missing from the roads, which will increase the problem of people during Aud Even
 dilli main 13 se 17 november tak od-ivan lagu rahane ke dauraan paanch dinon tak dilli parivahan nigam kii bason main muft safar kiya ja sakegaa
 Buses in these also include cluster buses
 yah elaan dilli sarkaar kii ore se kiya gaya he
 The rationale of the Delhi government behind this announcement is that people will give priority to DTC buses due to free travel, which will reduce congestion in the metro as well

 Investigations on the sudden death of 11 members of the same family on the same night have revealed many surprising things so far
 ghatana ke teen din baad chittorgarh main rahane vaale tisare bhai dinesh saamne aae hai
 However, he has denied any mention of tantra-mantra and bigotry or any tantric behind the deaths
 dinesh ne ghar se baahar nikle un11 pipon kaa rahasyabhi bataaya
 Dinesh says that the salvation from the pipe is absolutely wrong
 unhone kaha ki darasal unke bhai kaa plaiud kaa kaam tha, is vajah se kaaphi kaaphi gas banati thi or in 11 pipon ko isiilie lagavaaya gaya tha taaki gas nikalati rahe
 They clearly say, 'the things that the crime branch is doing are absolutely wrong
 hamaara parivaar dharmik parivaar tha
 There was no such thing
 ham puri tarah se is baat kaa khandan karte hai
 The police is investigating the case
 hamen nahin pataa ki register kii kya baat he
 It is not a case of suicide, it is a case of murder
 'vahiin dinesh kii bahan sujatha kaa kahana he ki unka parivaar dharmik he, lekin andhvishwasi katai nahin tha
 Sujatha has completely denied the tantra-mantra or tantric lore behind the deaths, saying that her family did not commit suicide but was murdered
 ghar se baahar nikle 11 pipon ke bare main sujatha kaa kahana he ki ye pipe ventilation or ek solar project ke liye lagaae gaye the
 There is some conspiracy somewhere
 11 pipon se kis tarah judaa he 11 mauton kaa rahasy!bataa den ki buraadi ke sant nagar main peedit parivaar ke ghar ke baahar kul 11 pipe nikle hue hai
 Police sources say 7 pipes in 11 pipes have their mouths up, while 4 pipes have straight mouths
 bataa den ki marane waalon main 7 mahilaayein or 4 purush sadsy the
 In fact, these pipes in the Bhatia family's house are seen to be connected to death
 kyonki ghar main kul 11 pipe lage hai jo kisi istemaal ke liye nahin lagaae gaye hai
 On seeing the pipe, it is clear that the family had a superstition
 kyonki ghar main maranevaalon kii sankhya 11 he, or pipe bhi 11 lage hai
 Apart from this, 7 women and 4 men are among those who die
 jabaki ghar kii diwaar main lage 11 pipon main se 7 mude hai or 4 sidhe hai
 According to sources, according to Lalit, all the members of the house had performed the first puja rituals late Saturday
 darasal pita kii maut ke baad uskaa daawa tha ki pita use dikhaai dete hai
 Actually, Lalit was told by his father in the dream of this entire ritual of worship and asked to attain salvation
 police sutron kaa kahana he ki ghar ke andar bane mandir ke paas miledonon registermein jo tantra-mantra, moksh or dharmik anushthan kii baaten likhi hai, ve lalit kii handriting main hi hai
 According to the police, Lalit says that his dead father comes in his dream and he has written the same things in the register
 moksh paanaa chahta tha parivaar, bachane kaa tha bharosadilli police krime branch ko pehle to lag rahaa tha ki puure parivaar ne dharmandhta ke jaal main funskar tantra-mantra or dharmik anushthan ke jariye moksh paane ke liye samuhik rup se khudakushi kar lee
 But now such things are coming out that none of the family members wanted to die but only wanted to attain salvation
 police sutron se mili ahm jaankaree ke mutabik, register main likhi baton or mauka-e-vaardaat se ye pataa chalata he ki darasal puraa parivaar ek anushthan kar rahaa tha
 The last step of this ritual was to hang it with a bandage on the hands and mouth, and the family probably believed that they would survive
 sabhi se kaha gaya tha ki vat puja se bhagwaan ke darshan hote hai
 No one will die by hanging and worshiping like a banyan
 bhagwaan kisi ko marane nahin denge
 Lalit used to say that his father used to tell him even in dreams what to do in relation to home and business and where to invest money
 register main likhaa tha 'maroge nahin, kuch bada hasil karoge'police ne bataaya ki register main lalit ne likhaa tha, 'pitaaji ne kaha he ki aakhri samay par jhatka lagegaa, aasmaan hilegaa, dharti hilegi
 But don't you worry, make the chanting fast, i will save you
 jab pani kaa rang badalegaa tab neeche utar janaa, ek duusare kii neeche utarane main madad karnaa
 You will not die, but you will achieve something big
 'police kaa kahana he ki lalit ke kehane par hi shanivaar kii raat puure parivaar ne puja anushthan kiya tha
 Havan was done at home and water was also filled in a bottle
 register main ye bhi likhaa hua tha ki haath kii pattee batch jaae to munh par dabl kar lenaa
 Sources say that Lalit and his wife Tina were not tied hands only
 register main 'vat savitri puja' kaa bhi zikr he
 Actually, Vat Savitri Puja is performed during the full moon and the night the family died, that is, the night of June 27-28 was also a full moon
 haalanki manyata ye he ki vat savitri kii puja patniyaan pati kii lambi umr ke liye karti hai

 Saho in India is releasing on 10 August screens on 30 August
 saaho relies se pehle hi kai record tod chuki he
 Saho is such that Bollywood filmmakers are scared at the box office
 tabhi to saaho ke aasapaas dur-dur tak koi badi film kii relies ke liye shedul nahin he
 VFX, of international quality, is the USP of the stunning action-stunt scene film
 4 bhashaaon main relies ho rahi saaho ke pehle din sabhi puraane record todane kii ummid he
 Let us know how Saho has become a threat to Hindi films and how Saho is on Day 2
 0, thags of hindustaan or bahubali 2 ke collection ko tod sakati he?first de 100 karod kamayegi prabhas kii sahmb jab saaho badi taadaad main relies ho rahi he to movie ke pehle din 100 karodi bananaa sarprising nahin hoga
 Actually, if you look at the figures, Rajinikanth's 2
 0 worldwide 10 hajaar screens par relies hui thi
 Out of which 7850 screens were found in India
 film ne pehle din bharat main 70 karod kaa bijness kiya
 Talking about Bahubali 2, the film was released worldwide on 9 thousand screens and in India on 6500 screens
 bahubali 2 ne pehle din 121 karod kamakar kirtmaan rachaa
 The plus point with the first day collection will break the old records of Sahosaho that it is being released on 10,000 screens in India alone
 videshon ke screen count kii pukhta jaankaree abhi saamne nahin ai he
 In such a situation, Saho can break all the old records of earning on the first day
 south main to single screens par saaho ke tikaton ke daam badhaane kii bhi khabaren aa rahi hai
 By the way, according to the estimates of some trade analysts, the total collection of Saho in India on the first day may be close to 75 crores
 saaho first de hindi varjan main 15-20 karod kama sakati he
 But given the sharing of screens and the buzz made about the film, do not be surprised if this film breaks the box office records of the first day earnings in India
 agar saaho pehle din 60 karod se zyada kamaane main safal hoti he to movie thags of hindustaan, avengers: andgem or kabir singh ke first de box offis collection kaa record tod degi
 How is Bollywood scared of Saaho? Batla House and Mission Mangal were released on 15 August
 iske baad se koi badi film nahin ai he

 After 30 August, no major film is coming till 13 September
 13 sitambar ko section 375 or dream girl relies hogi
 Saho has got an empty ground before release and after release

 Digvijay Singh recorded his statement in the court of Special Judge Suresh Singh regarding this matter

 'rajasthan mev panchayat' ne mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ko patr likhakar muslim mev samaaj se mantri banaae jane kii maang kii he
 Explain that the Congress fielded 15 Muslim candidates in the Assembly elections, out of which 7 Muslims were successful in winning
 iske alaava ek seat par basapa se muslim vidhayak bana he
 Zahida Khan, Saleh Mohammed, Hakam Ali, Rafiq Khan, Amin Kagaji, Amin Khan, Danish Abrar and bsp's Wajib Ali Khan are mlas from the Congress
 congress ne mantri mandal ke liye formula banaaya he ki jo vidhayak pehali baar jite hai, unhen mauka nahin diya jayega
 In such a situation, there are five mlas who have become mlas for the first time
 jabaki congress ke teen vidhayak aise hai jo ek baar se zyada jeet hasil kar chuke he
 Under this formula, Saleh Mohammed is being made a minister in Gehlot's new cabinet
 jabaki jaahida khan kaa naam bhi mantri ke liye chal rahaa tha
 Muslim society and organizations have started raising questions about Muslim representation in Gehlot government
 unhen lagata he ki congress ne unhen najar andaaj kiya he
 Not only this, the Muslim Meo society, considered the strongest vote bank of Muslims in Rajasthan, has not received due consideration
 ise lekar mev samaaj main baari naaraazgi dikh rahi he
 Whereas in many districts including Alwar and Bharatpur in the state, there is a large number of voters of the Meo community
 rajasthan muslim mev samaaj ke adhyaksh choudhary shabbir ahamed ne mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ko patr likhakar kaha he ki soobe main mev samaaj ne ekajute hokar congress ko vot diya he
 In such a situation, there is anger in the society from not making the legislators who won from the Meo society
 yahi ravaiya rahaa to party ko loksabhaa chunaav main nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 Milli Council Rajasthan President Abdul Qayyum said, "it is utterly unfair to make a minister out of Muslim society
 is sambandh main hamaara pratinidhimandal mukhyamantri ke saath mulaakaat kar musalamaanon ke bhaagedari ko badhaane kii maang kii he
 The earlier Congress government in the state has had more than one minister
 'mohammad jaahid ne bataaya ki rajasthan ke musalamaanon kii aawaaj uthaane vaala dilli main koi nahin bachaa he
 As a result, participation in the government of Muslims is minimal
 jabaki ek taur main tayyab choudhary jaise netaa the
 Now they are missing
 musalamaanon ke paas vikalp na hone ke chalate congress uskaa phayda uthaa rahi he
 Explain that in the Rajasthan assembly elections, Muslim voters unitedly voted for the Congress
 iskaa nateeja tha ki tonk seat se bijepi ke diggaj netaa or muslim cheharaa maane jane vaale younus khan ke bajaay muslim samaaj se congress ke sachin payalat ko vot karke jitayaa
 In the village of Patli police station in Barabanki district of UP, late Saturday, three youths committed gang rape with a retarded woman

 saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav aam aadmi party ke liye sansadeey chunaav main damdaar aagaaj tha
 Despite the Modi wave, winning four seats for the party contesting Lok Sabha elections for the first time was no less a big achievement, that too from the same state of Punjab
 lekin paanch saal baad vahi aam aadmi party punjab main mushkil wicket par he
 Many top party leaders associated with the state have left
 aam aadmi party kaa sara daaromadar party ke kendriya netaaon, khaas taur par arvind kejariwal par tikaa he
 However, Kejriwal's apology on the issue of drugs and allegations of support from Khalistani elements have shocked the party's prospects in this election
 paanch saal pehle tak jis punjab main kejariwal ko rakshak or drugs ke khatre se bachaane vaala samajha ja rahaa tha, unheen kejariwal ko somvaar ko sangrur main kaale jhande dikhaae gaye
 The party's good performance in the 2014 Punjab Lok Sabha elections also saw an impact in the 2017 Punjab Assembly elections
 kejariwal kii party punjab kii paramparaagat party shiromani akali dal ko tisare number par dhakelkar duusare number kii party ban gai or use hi mukhya vipakshi dal kaa darja mila
 Changes after 2017 The situation has become difficult for the Aam Aadmi Party since 2017
 kejariwal ne akali dal ke netaa bikram majithia ke khilaaf drugs samasya ke liye jimmedaar tehraane sambandhi apane aaropon par maafee maangi
 This development served to reduce the party's support base in Punjab
 aisa nahin hota to kejariwal ko is baar chunaav prachaar main baikfoot par na hona padataa
 Bhagwant Mann is the biggest bet for the Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab

 Gandhi, who was one of the first local leaders to raise a flag of protest against Kejriwal, left no stone unturned to target the party's central leadership, accusing him of vandalism with the people of Punjab
 punjab main kai choti partiyon ko milakar bane punjab democratic alliance (pidie) ke ummidavaar ke taur par gandhi is baar chunavi ran main utre hai
 Gandhi says, 'kejriwal promised Swaraj and democracy in the party
 unhone kaha tha ki party main koi haikaman nahin hoga or sthaneey netaaon ko taqatvar banaaya jayega
 In reality, he imposed leader Punjab from Delhi
 punjab ke logon ne unhen sabak sikhaaya he
 Their cadre base is over
 sivaae bhagwant maan ke unke saare ummidavaar chunaav haarenge
 'this time in Punjab, aap's Aam Aadmi Party has a fire test this time in Punjab, along with a divided house
 party ke chaar saansadon main se do saath chhodkar ja chuke hai
 In Punjab, more than half a dozen mlas of the party have formed their own front, so that Kejriwal can be challenged in the elections
 varisht netaaon ke saath chhodane kii vajah se party ko kai siton par majboot ummidavaar milanaa hi mushkil ho gaya
 The party has already shown the exit route to the Leader of Opposition Sukhpal Singh Kheda, formed after the assembly elections by AAP
 kheda ne khud kii punjab ekta party bana lee or ab bathinda main kendriya mantri or akali dal ummidavaar harsimrat cor badal ke khilaaf chunavi maidan main hai
 Kheda says, "kejriwal promised to uproot the drugs from cancer, but later apologized to Majithia
 unka aadhaar khatm ho chukaa he
 Kejriwal also vowed never to join hands with the corrupt Congress, but recently everyone saw how he kept on praying for an alliance with the Congress
 ”AAP ko pradarshan dohraane kaa bharosahaalanki aap ke kendriya netaaon ko ab bhi punjab main 2014 kaa pradarshan dohraane kaa bharosa he
 Party leader and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh told India Today, “we introspective about our flaws
 punjab main sanghathan ko badla gaya
 There were some flaws, but we will return again this time
 ”bataa den ki dilli kii saat loksabhaa siton ke liye matdaan nipat chukaa he
 The central leaders of the AAP are now working hard to save the party from further embarrassment in Punjab
 lekin is baar party ke liye dagar mushkil lagati he
 This is the same party that was once being projected as a reliable alternative in state politics

 The BJP is busy making the list of candidates for the Lok Sabha elections

 However, Jaitley also wants to jump into the fray
 unke liye sahi siten amritsar or jaipur ho sakati hai
 But the final decision for Jaitley is left to Modi
 party ke purv adhyaksh venkaiya naidu bhi management main lagenge
 By the way Venkaiah Naidu wanted to contest from Nellore in Andhra Pradesh

 Asarambapu surprised everyone with his statements in the September 2013 Nirbhaya gang rape case
 unke bayanon se saaf ho gaya tha ki mahilaon ko lekar unka najariya kya he? unke bayaan hi unke charitra kii kahani kehete hai
 Asaram was present in Tonk district in Rajasthan at the time when he was gang-raped in a moving bus in Delhi
 usne apane shivi ke manch se dilli balaatkaar maamle par kai besange bayaan dekar balaatkaar par chal rahi tikhi rashtriya bahes main baba ne hastkshep kiya
 Baba's comments made Delhi's late rape victim guilty instead of the male criminals who raped the girl
 usnekaha ki yadi us ladki ne saraswati mantra kaa paath kiya hota yaa unase diksha lee hoti to vah us bas par savaar hi na hui hoti
 Earlier, he said that if he had called rapists as brothers, he probably would not have raped her
 isi bich yah aapattijanak bayaan bhi de daalaa, 'ek haath se tali nahin baj sakati
 'blind devotees of the controversial Guru have been taught that hell is bound to be met if the Guru is questioned
 lihaaja, unhone is bhayanak vivaad se unhen nikaalane kii bajaae unka bachaav kar use or bhayanak banane main hi yogadan diya
 As one of Asaram's spokesmen Neelam Dubey said, "baba's statements have been severely twisted
" ve peedita ko dosha nahin de rahe the balki sirf yah kah rahe the ki vah bhi kam-se-kam ek pratishat jimmedaar to thi hi kyonki usne aisi lagbhag khaali bas main chadhane kii galati kii thi jisamen ek bhi mahila maujuud nahin thi
 Asaram's statement was widely criticized but had no effect on Baba and he stood by his controversial statements opposing the idea of giving death penalty to rapists
 unhone tark diya, ''iskaa istemaal deele-dhaale charitra kii mahilaon dwaara purushon ke viruddh thik usee tarah se kiya jayega, jaise sakht dahej virdohi kanoon kaa istemaal kuch mahilaayein apane patiyon ko pareshaan karne ke liye kar rahi hai

" ke samrajya vaale ek aadhyatmik guru ke rup main asumal thoumal harplani urf asaram baapu kaa utthan sachmuch kisi sapane jaisaa hi rahaa he
 Today, Asaram has no special count when it comes to the knowledge of the scriptures, but in terms of wealth, he is more than many gurus who give lectures today
 unke samrajya main bharat ke pramukh shaharon main yaa uske aas-paas mahatvapurn sthanon par hajaaron acre jameen or aadhyatmik patrikaon ke alaava ayurvedic dawa, agarbatti, shampoo tathaa sabun jaise do darjan se adhik utpaadon kaa ek faltaa-phulataa kaarobaar shaamil he, jisase unhen karodon ru

 Asaram was born in a village called Birani near Nawabshah in Sindh province of Pakistan
 bharat ke vibhaajan or pakistan ke nirmaan ke samay hue sampradayik dangon ke kaaran unke pita thoumal ko sindh se bhagkar kuccha or phir ahmedabad aane ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 Matric Fell Asaram was only seven years old then
 20 ke hone ke baad asaram, lilashah baba kaa aashirwad lene ke liye kuccha ke adipur main sthit unke ashram main gaye
 Leelashah Baba was a respected spiritual man and died in 1973
 kuccha ke sindhi bujurgon kaa kahana he ki lilashah baba apni mrityu ke samay asaram ko pasand nahin karte the, phir bhi asaram baapu ke anuyaayi yahi bataate hai ki lilashah hi unke guru the
 The bad phase for Asaram came between 2008 and 2010 when he and his son Narayan Sai faced charges such as sexual exploitation of women, sacrificing children for tantric purposes and land grabbing using violence
 lekin ye aarope sabit nahin ho paae
 Not only that, his accusations did not affect his image either, but his number of disciples either remained constant or increased in many places and independent observers along with his enemies were also surprised by the secret of his power
 
 jaisaa ki unke samarpit shishy udai sanghani kehete hai, 'baapu ke khilaaf aarope aise asantusht logon ne lagaae hai jo baapu se kuch anuchit kaam karana chaahate the or jise ve kabhi nahin kara paae
 The number of his followers has increased because those who benefited from his spiritual experience with Bapu relied on his experience rather than the negative publicity of media based on false accusations and shared his feelings with new people
 'udhaaharan ke liye gujarat ke anya pichde varg (obisi) se aane vaale 35 varshiya di
 s
 baaria kaa hi maamla lijie, jo asaram baapu ke samarpit anuyaayi hai or san francisco main ek computer vaigyanik ke rup main kaary kar rahe hai
 He is a symbol of a Khanty follower of Asaram
 unka kahana he ki asaram kii shikshaaon kii vajah se hi ve america ja paae or jivan main aage bad paae
 In his words, 'the intensity of the negative campaign against him was much less than the intensity of the spiritual values which millions of people like me have accepted from him
 kisi anya cheez se adhik hamane unke saath ke apane anubhavon par bharosa kiya he
 Bapu has instilled a unique pride in our culture, religion and spirituality
 'is dauraan baba ke rajnatik anuyaayiyon kii sankhya main bhi badhotaree hui dikhti he
 In 2011, he became the state guest of seven states, including the Congress and bjp-ruled states
 pichley do varshon ke dauraan jo mukhyamantri unase milane aae, unamem haal hi main himachal pradesh main haar kaa swaad chakhne vaale prem kumaar dhumal, chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh, rajasthan ke ashok gahalot, madhya pradesh ke shivaraj singh chouhan or yahaan tak ki punjab ke netaa prakaash singh badal shaamil hai
 Influenced by Asaram Bapu's efforts to celebrate 'parents' Puja Day' against the western concept of Valentine's Day, the Raman Singh government declared 2011 Valentine's Day as' Parental Puja Day 'in Chhattisgarh
 ahmedabad main asaram baapu ke aahvaan par 60 skulon ne pichley vailemtine de ko mata-pita pujan diwas ke rup main manaaya
 Apparently, Asaram can be said to be controversial but highly influential among all spiritual gurus
 *** Strongly advocating for the creation of a separate Telangana state, NCP chief Sharad Pawar told Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday that delay in the matter will not be helpful
 rakanpa pramukh ne aaj kaha ki unhone pradhanmantri ke samaksh is mudde ko uthaaya
 The NCP is the first constituent of the UPA which has openly supported the early decision on Telangana and is expecting a UPA meeting soon in this regard
 samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main pavaar ne jor diya ki congress ‘‘aam taur par telugana samarthak’ he
 The comments pavaar ne kaha, ‘‘sawaal (alag rajya kaa gathan) samay kii baat he
 We want the formation of Telangana at the earliest
 isamen vilamb hamaare liye madadgaar nahin hoga
 The Union Agriculture Minister said that his party has long been a supporter of a separate Telangana state and had also rallied a few years ago with TRS chief k Chandrasekhar Rao
 pavaar ne kaha ki agar vidarbha kshetra bhi ek alag rajya ban jaataa he to rakanpa ko koi aapatti nahin he
 He said, "we will not come in the way
" ’’ The NCP chief today said that he raised the issue with the Prime Minister
 rakanpa samprag kaa pehla ghatak dal he jisane telugana par sheeghra faisle kaa khule taur par samarthan kiya he or is sambandh main sheeghra samprag kii baithak hone kii ummid kar rahaa he
 Talking to reporters, Pawar emphasized that the Congress is "generally pro-telangana"
 tippaniyan Pawar said, "the question (formation of a separate state) is a matter of time
" ham yathashighra telugana kaa gathan chaahate hai
 Delay in this will not be helpful for us
 ’’ kendriya krishi mantri ne kaha ki unki party lambey samay se alag telugana rajya kaa samarthak he or usne kuch saal pehle tiares pramukh ke chandrashekhar raav ke saath raily bhi kii thi

" ’’ The Congress is desperately trying to field a strong candidate in the Varanasi seat against bjp's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but again and again he seems to be disappointed
 loksabhaa chunaav main modi ke badhate kad ko dekhte hue congress kii chif ellection kamity saare vikalpon par vichaar kar rahi he
 Accordingly, according to media reports, the Congress had approached Bharat Ratna Sachin Tendulkar to contest against Modi
 lekin 'cricket ke bhagwaan' ne is prastaav ko thukraa diya
 Currently Sachin Tendulkar is a Rajya Sabha MP and it is being said in the news that he does not want to contest the Lok Sabha elections
 isse pehle paanch rajyon main hue vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan madhya pradesh congress ne party haikaman se sachin ko star prachaarak banane kii maang kii thi
 Even then, Sachin refused to play any role in the election campaign
 aapako bataa den ki sachin tendulkar ke sammaan main india today group ne mumbai main 'salaam sachin' naam se ek kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya tha, jisamen bisisiai ke upaadhyaksh or kendriya mantri rajeev shukla ne kaha tha ki sachin ke raajnneeti main aane kaa sawaal hi nahin he
 Shukla had said that Sachin had made three important promises to his father, never smoking cigarettes, never drinking alcohol and never going into politics
 is bich, upi congress ne modi ke khilaaf purv bijepi adhyaksh ajay raay kaa naam sujhaayaa he
 Ajay Rai contested the 2009 general election on the Samajwadi Party ticket after leaving the BJP
 upi congress kaa maananaa he ki ajay raay banaras main khaase lokapriy hai
 He was third in the 15th Lok Sabha election
 2004 main congress ke rajesh kumaar mishra do lakh voton se jeet kar sansad pahunche the
 But in 2009, bjp's Murali Manohar Joshi won from Varanasi and Mishra slipped to number four

 The Congress's Chief Election Committee is also considering fielding a local Brahmin candidate against Modi
 bharat ke wicketiper ballebaaj or indian premier lig (ipel) kii team kolkata nite rides ke captain dinesh karthik ko bisisiai ne kaaran bataao notice diya he
 The BCCI has given this notice to Karthik as the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) team Trinbago Knight Riders had gone to the dressing room
 karthik team ke coach brendan makkulam ke saath dressing room main the
 mccullum has also recently been appointed coach of Kolkata
 board ke ek senior adhikari ne ieenes se baat karte hue is baat kii pushti kii he or kaha he ki karthik ko aisa karne se pehle ijaajat leni chahie thi kyonki vah abhi bhi board ke kendriya anubandh praapt khilaadiyon kii suchi main hai
 Karthik has to reply to this notice within seven days
 adhikari ne kaha, 'chunki vah bhartiya team ke khilaadi hai aise main kuch protocol hote hai jinka paalan karnaa hota he
 He is involved in the central contract and as such he cannot go to the dressing room of the CPL without the permission of the BCCI
 unhen saat dinon ke andar notice kaa jawaab dena hoga
 Both Trinbago and Kolkata franchises are owned by Indian actor Shah Rukh Khan
 lekin bisisiai apane rukh par saaf he ki bhartiya khilaadiyon kaa videsh kii tii-20 ligon se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 However, it is not clear whether Karthik going to the dressing room was a common practice or that he had gone there to strategize for the next season of IPL
 karthik kaa bhavishya ab is baat par nirbhar karata he ki prashaskon kii samiti (sioe) is masale ko kis tarah se dekhati he
 The official said, 'it has to be seen how the COA takes their reply
