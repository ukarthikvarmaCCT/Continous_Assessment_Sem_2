 unhone kaha 'yadi log apni marji se dharm parivatarn karnaa chaahate hai to unhen aisa karne se koi nahin roak saktaa, yah unka mul adhikaar he
 ' punjab main sattadhari congress ke mantriyon or vidhayakon ne selary main badhotaree kii maang kii he
 They demand that the monthly salary be increased to 4-5 lakhs
 vidhayakon or mantriyon kaa tark he ki unki rank punjab ke chif secretary or iees ke baraabar he
 In such a situation, their salary should be increased
 vidhayakon ne bataaya ki philhal unhen bhatte sahit kareeb 93 hajaar rupee prati maah milte hai
 The legislators argue that this salary is very low and should be increased to Rs 5 lakh per month
 congress ke vidhayakon or mantriyon kaa kahana he ki rojaanaa unase milane kareeb 500 se 600 log unke vidhansabha kshetra ke daftar aate hai
 In such a situation, every visitor has to get tea-water and breakfast
 saath hi vidhayak ko ilaake ke kai kaaryakramon, shaadi-byaah jaise maukon par apni jeb se paisa shagun or tohfe ke taur par bhi dena padataa he
 In such a situation, it is not easy for an MLA to run his house with all these tasks
 philhal aise miltaa he vetan:-vetan- 25 hajaar rupye prati maah-vidhansabha kshetra kaa bhatta- 25 hajaar rupee prati maah-offis kaa bhatta- 15 hajaar rupye-secretary kaa bhatta- 10 hajaar rupee prati mahinke alaava kuch or bhatton kii suvidha bhi vidhayakon ko milti he
 Preparation for constitutional amendment: Punjab has Congress in power and ruling mlas are demanding this
 aise main punjab legislative member act, 1942 main sanshodhan kar vidhayakon kii selary badhaane kii taiyaari kii ja rahi he
 However, the Punjab government is not openly speaking on this
 punjab ke vitt mantri manpreet badal ne kaha ki agar vetan badhaane kaa koi bhi faisla liya jayega to wo vidhansabha kii cameti kii taraf se liya jayega
 There will be no interference from the government in the decision of the committee
 lekin manpreet badal ne ye baat nahin maani ki punjab kii vittiya haalat is vakt behad khasta he or vidhayakon kii selary abhi nahin badhani chahie
 In fact, this demand got a boost when Chief Minister Amarinder Singh increased the salary of his advisors by more than three times to about one and a half lakh to one and a half lakh
 isi vajah se vidhayakon ko bhi lagata he ki unki selary badhani chahie
 The Aam Aadmi Party says that the salary of Punjab mlas should not be increased but they should get a separate fund of about 3 crore rupees every year which they can use in their area

 cricket kii sabase badi sanstha bisisiine 86 saalon ke itihaas main pehali baar apni salanaa report main rajanetaaon ke photo cover par prakashit kiye hai
 The President's picture has been printed giving Bharat Ratna to cricketer Sachin Tendulkar while PM Narendra Modi is shown taking oath

 But only two days after that he resigned from that post

 Arun Jaitley, the Administrator of the Board
 bisisiai dwaara cricketron kii bajaay rajanetaaon kii tasviir prakashit karne ko purv khilaadiyon dwaara kai dhang se dekha ja rahaa he
 While on the one hand many are not getting anything wrong in this, some are saying that it is surprising
 unka kahana he ki is tarah se board kai maamalon main raahat paane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 The board has been implicated in many cases, including tax and information matters
 uske mukademe hai court or supreme court main bhi chal rahe hai
 Former BCCI treasurer Kishore Rungta said that neither does it matter to Modi ji nor to Jaitley ji
 isse bisisiai ko bhi koi phayda nahin hoga
 If they think that they will get some relief in this way then there is no possibility
 lekin kai khilaadi maanate hai ki piem kii tasviir chhapane main kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Signature of Chief in the Balance Sheet Not signed by the Board Chief in the Balance Sheet of BCCI 2013-14 as always before
 is baar kii report main na to chif ke dastakhat hai or na hi unki report
 Generally, such reports are an anthem of past year's achievements
 haalanki shivlal yadav board ke antarim president hone ke naate is par dastakhat kar sakate the lekin lagata he ki vahaan kuch log unhen board president kii report likhane dena nahin chaahate hai
 BCCI auditor Bilimoria & Co

 isliye vah jagah khaali he

 trump ne jor diya ki pichley saal ke chunaav abhiyaan main unka or unke prachaar abhiyaan kaa masco se koi sambandh nahin tha
 He blamed the Justice Department and his political rival Hillary Clinton for this

 ’ vahiin ek or twitor post ne unki sthiti jatil bana di jisamen unhone sanket diya ki unhone flin ko isliye hataaya tha kyonki vah uparashtrapati mike pence or epabiai donon ke prati eemaandaar nahin the

 sharad yadav ke saath unki party ke duusare bade padaadhikari bhi honge
 Significantly, the oil companies had last week raised petrol prices by a lump sum of Rs 5 to reduce their losses against which there are protests across the country

 President Pranab Mukherjee dismissed the plea of the 8 convicts who have stayed the execution

 He was buried in Tihar itself
 afjal ke parijanon ne aarope lagaaya tha ki unhen faansee kii koi soochna nahin di gai
 On the other hand, the Central Government had dismissed the allegation of the family of Afzal, saying that information about the hanging was given through speed post
 baharhaal, maamla ek baar phir tool pakadta najar aa rahaa he
 What is the whole matter
 
 
 raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne faansee kii sajaa paae 9 gunahagaaron kii dayaa yachika par isi hafte faisla sunaaya tha
 All 9 of them were convicted in seven different cases
 inamen se ek dharmpal naam kaa shaks haryana main rape or hatya kaa doshi he
 In 5 cases out of seven separate cases, the President upheld the death sentence of 7 people, while in two cases the death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment
 ayodhya ke ram mandir or babari masjid vivaad ne bhartiya raajnneeti kii dasha or disha ko hameshaa ke liye badalakar rakh diya he
 On December 6, 1992, Karsevaks from all over the country reached Ayodhya for the construction of the Ram temple and broke the Babri Masjid
 babari vidhwans ko aaj 26 saal puure ho gaye
 The BJP also got a distinct shine from the Ram Mandir movement
 is andolan kaa hi nateeja tha ki 1989 ke loksabhaa ke chunaav main 9 saal puraani bijepi 2 siton se badhkar 85 par pahunch gai thi
 But most of the faces of the BJP which gave the edge to this movement and became the heroes for the party in the Babri demolition in 1992, most of them are in the background today
 babari vidhwans ke aaropeeis andolan ko dhar dene vaale bijepi ke pramukh chehron main laalkrishna adwani, kalyaan singh, murali manohar joshi, uma bharti, vinay katiyaar or ram vilaas vedanti ke naam aate hai
 The BJP decided to run the Ram Mandir movement in the 1989 Palampur session
 viechpi ke ashok singhl, sadhvi ritanbharaa, acharya dharmendra, biel sharma giriraaj kishor or vishnu hari daalamia
 Of these, Ashok Singhal and Giriraj Kishore are no longer in this world
 moreshwar saave, chanpat raay bansal, satish pradhan, mahant avaidhyanath, dharmadas, mahant nrity gopal das, mahamandaleshwar jagadish muni, ramvilas vedanti, vaikunth laal sharma prem, paramhans ramchandra das or satish chandra nagar shaamil rahe
 Advani took a rath yatra from Somnath to Ayodhya in 1990 to create an atmosphere in the country in favor of the largest Chehraram temple
 isi yatra se ayodhya andolan ko dhar mili thi
 People from many cities and villages of the country were arriving in Ayodhya to perform Karseva
 ayodhya samet desh ke kai hisson main 'ram lalaa ham aaenge, mandir vahiin banaaenge' kaa naaraa gunj rahaa tha
 Advani became the face of the bjp's biggest Hindutva movement from the Ayodhya movement
 babari vidhwans ke dauraan aadwani ayodhya main maujuud the
 They are accused of conspiracy for the Babri demolition and the matter is in court
 laalkrishna adwani kii bijepi desh kii satta main he, lekin aaj ve bijepi maardarshak mandal main hai
 Kalyan had given the name of the temple to the government, after Kurban Advani, Kalyan Singh's name comes as the second biggest face of the Ayodhya movement
 darasal, 6 disambar 1992 ko ayodhya main babari vidhwans ko samay kalyaan singh upi ke mukhyamantri the
 While he had given an affidavit in the Supreme Court that as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, he would not allow any damage to the mosque
 iske baavjood karsevak masjid tod rahe the or prashasan mookadarshak ban tamaasha dekh rahaa tha
 On the second day, the central government dismissed the welfare government of UP
 kalyaan singh ne us samay kaha tha ki ye sarkaar ram mandir ke naam par bani thi or uskaa makasad puraa hua
 In such a situation, the government sacrificed in the name of Ram temple
 ayodhya main babari masjid giraae jane or uski raksha na karne ke liye kalyaan singh ko ek din kii sajaa bhi mili
 Kalyan Singh, who was once one of the strongest leaders of BJP, is currently the Governor of Rajasthan
 bijepi netaa ke taur par murali manohar joshi ne ram mandir andolan ke pramukh chehre the
 Joshi was also present in Ayodhya during the Babri demolition
 ayodhya maamle main wo aaropee hai
 Although Murali Manohar Joshi is currently just a Lok Sabha MP, there is no special role in the Modi government
 adwani kii tarah ve bhi bijepi ke maardarshak mandal main shaamil hai
 Uma got recognition from Ayodhya Uma Bharti got political identity from Ayodhya movement
 babari vidhwans ke dauraan uma bharti ayodhya main maujuud rahi or unhen bhi is maamle main aaropee hai
 He was recognized as the face of Hindutva and a fire brigade leader
 bijepi netaaon main unki tuuti bolti thi, maujuuda samay main modi sarkaar main mantri hai lekin bhavishya main loksabhaa chunaav na ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 Vinay Katiyar's attitude towards the fire brigade Chehraram Temple Adolan of Katiyar Ram Temple was strict from the beginning and it remains the same today
 katiyaar kattar hindutv ke cheharaa maane jate the
 Vinay Katiyar was present in Ayodhya during the Babri demolition and he is an accused in the case
 karsevakon ko babari masjid todane ke liye uksaane kaa aarope katiyaar par laga he
 He is currently a mere member of the BJP and neither has his role in the party nor in the government
 ayodhya kaa sadhu ban gaya saasanyodhya andolan ke chehre ke taur ram vilaas vedanti kaa naam bhi aata he
 The name comes in the great sages of Ayodhya
 ram mandir adolan ne vedanti ko raajnneetik pahchaan di or wo bijepi saansad bane the
 Currently, Ram is trying to create an atmosphere in favor of temple construction, but BJP and government are marginalized
 iske alaava babari vidhwans ke dauraan rajmata vijayraaje sindhiya bhi ayodhya main maujuud thim, lekin unka nidhan ho chukaa he
 Apart from this, Swami Chinmayanand was also a big face of the Ayodhya movement, but at present, both BJP and Shearkar have no role
 bharat band ko lekar chhattisgarh main congress samet tamaam vipakshi dalon kaa band samarthakon ko vyapak samarthan mila he
 Despite this, the bandh remained ineffective
 darasal rajya main vyapaarik sanghathanon or chembar of commers ke band kaa samarthan na karne se janajivan puri tarah se saamaanya rahaa
 However, the protesters raised their voice against the amendment to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989
 pradarshnakariyon ne sabase pehle raipur ke bahari ilaake ke petrol panpon ko band karne kii koshish kii, lekin kaamyaab nahin ho paae
 On the occasion, the police force took the front and instructed not to forcefully stop
 natijatan narebaaji kar pradarshnakariyon ne duusare ilaakon kaa rukh kar liya
 In Jagdalpur, there was a fierce protest between the protesters and businessmen who had come out to close the main market
 yahaan bhi pradarshnakariyon kii daal nahin gali
 Things were normal in Dhamtari and Mahasamund districts
 subah dalit sanghathanon ke kaaryakartaaon ne vyapaariyon se apana kaarobaar band rakhane kii apil kii
 But he did not listen to one of the protesters and kept his business establishments open

 Only Dalit traders closed their business here

 The Dalit community also took out a rally in these areas

 In the morning all educational institutions, including the school of the school, opened as usual
 schuli bason samet yatri sevaaon se jude vaahan bhi sadakon par raftaar bharte rahe
 No untoward incident has been reported from anywhere
 chhattisgarh main chand maheenon ke bheetar vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Therefore, the Congress tried to heat up politics about the Dalit movement
 shahari ilaakon main bike raily bhi nikaali
 The Congress activist, along with the protesters, also moved to the markets so that the business could be shut down and the bandh could be widely seen
 magar police ne unke armaanon par pani pher die
 In view of the Bharat Bandh, the administration had made elaborate security arrangements from urban areas to rural areas
 saadi vardi ke alaava mahatvapurn sthalon par baari bharkam police bal tainaat kiya gaya tha

 He was a part of many memorable victories against Pakistan, but the most memorable moment for this former Indian opener Virender Sehwag against this arch-rival was the World T20 tie match, which India won in the ball out
 bharat vartmaan vishwa tii20 main shanivaar ko kolkata main pakistan se bhidega jise hameshaa kii tarah kaaphi mahatvapurn mana ja rahaa he
 According to a release, Sehwag said, "my most memorable moment in the matches between India and Pakistan was the ICC World T20 2007 match which missed the tie
 kisi ne nahin sochaa tha ki donon deshon ke bich vishwa tii20 kaa pehla match taai rahegaa

 kisi ne nahin sochaa tha ki donon deshon ke bich vishwa tii20 kaa pehla match taai rahegaa
 The rule then was that if the match was a tie, the decision would be by 'ball out'

 yah meraa pehla match tha or main ek ran par out ho gaya, lekin is match ke dauraan mujhe apane kariyar main pehali baar bharat-paak ke bich match ke tanaav kaa pataa chalaa
 i understood the importance of the match between India and Pakistan and i came to know its importance for the players participating in these matches
 sahvaag ne kaha, ‘‘us match main main saatven number par ballebaaji ke liye aayaa tathaa imran nazeer or shahid afridi ne lagaataar gaaliyaan dekar meraa swaagat kiya
 So much so that it seemed that Afridi is my friend and we only talk among ourselves in abuses
 shoeb akhtar ne mujhe out kiya or usne bhi mujh par taana maarane kaa mauka nahin ganvaaya kyonki main uski pehali gend par out ho gaya tha
 After this i started waiting for my chance while fielding
 sahvaag ne kaha ki jab vah baad main maidan par laute to unhone pakistani khilaadiyon ke saath vaisaa hi vyavhaar kiya
 "I said abusive words to some of their players but did not cross the boundary because we Indians respect our rivals and focus more on playing than chanting and abusing

 co / gkkghqvslj After a long wait, the DDA housing scheme will finally be drawn on November 30
 is yojana ke antargat 12 hajaar flats aate hai
 All the preparations for the draw have been completed by the DDA, but it is important to know here that out of the 12 thousand flats, there are about 11 thousand LIG flats, which were earlier prepared for EWS
 varsh 2014 kii awasaiya yojana main bhi ye flats shaamil the, lekin inkaa kshetrafal kam hone ke chalate logon ne inhen lene se inkaar kar diya tha
 The DDA may be selling a big tribute to the new housing scheme, but the truth is that there are about 11 thousand old houses whose people had abandoned in 2014 due to the poor condition
 yahi dekhte hue didie ne is baar in flaton kii vaapasi kaa koi rasta nahin rakhaa he
 That is, if you have filled the form and if you get the flat then you will not have to buy the flat or your deposit will be confiscated
 didie ke elayeeji flats kii haalat khastadid kii awasaiya yojana ke antargat jitne bhi flats aate hai unamem zyaadaatar khastahal hai
 People who took flats in 2014 are still crying
 didie ne makaan bana ke to de diya he par uske baad inaki dekh-rekh or rakh-rakhaav bhagwaan bharose he
 People of Jasola Vihar's 10B LIG Housing Society are extremely upset
 2011 se yahaan par apane parivaar ke saath rah rahe manoj kaa kahana he, 'jis din se aae hai pareshaan hai, kuch na kuch laga hi rahata he, hamase 76 hajaar mentaness kaa liya tha didie ne or kaha tha 2 saal 3 saal or 5 saal ke baad marammat karenge par aaj tak ek baar bhi nahi hui
 The walls are such that it seems to have pasted the sand
 ek keel thoko to bharbhara ke girane lagati he
 'the biggest problem of DDA Societies is the lack of water and basic facilities
 pichley teen saal se rah raheen rekha kaa kahana he, 'garmiyon main pani 2 se 3 din baad aata he or jo aata he wo itnaa khaaraa kisteel ke saare bartan kalepad gaye hai
 Washing clothes is difficult
 nahaana or khaanaa-pinaa to bhul jaaie
 Drink water buy from outside
 aaro bhi nahi laga sakate kyonki kitna bhi mahangaa aaro lagaao 3 se 4 maheene main kharaab ho jaataa he
 'the number of applicants is decreasing
 About 42 thousand people have applied for 12 thousand flats in this residential scheme
 jabaki varsh 2014 kii awasaiya yojana main 10 lakh se adhik form jamaa hue the, vahiin 2017 kii awasaiya yojana main keval 42 hajaar form logon kii didie kii awasaiya yojanaon ke prati maayusi ko darshane ke liye kaaphi hai
 About 20 thousand people have applied for this LIG flat
 jisase is baar elayeeji ke liye aavedan karne vaale har duusare vyakti ko flats milanaa tay he
 But the question is, how will the DDA, which has already turned its back on the problems of the people who are crying after buying houses, will be able to fulfill the promises made for the new schemes? vitt mantri pranab mukherjee ne kaha he ki paanch rajyon main chunaav khatm hone ke baad hi varsh 2012-13 kaa aam bajet pesh kiya jayega
 However, the government has not taken a final decision on its date

 Pakistani media has claimed that Taliban leader Mullah Omar's name has been secretly removed from the US intelligence agency fbi's list of wanted terrorists
 vahiin epabiai ne safai di he ki afghanistan main talibani shashan ke dauraan pramukh netaa rahaa mullah umr kabhi bhi epabiai kii vaanchhiton kii suchi main nahin shaamil kiya gaya he
 However, the State Department has placed a reward of ten million dollars on it

 duniya ke bazaar main khadaa ro rahaa he rupaya
 The rupee is shedding tears of its steadily falling credit in the money market
 ye giravat pichley kai maheenon se jari he
 The condition on Monday was that the rupee fell more than 61 against the dollar
 rupee kaa girnaa sirf aankadon kaa khel nahin, balki rote rupee ke aansuon kaa asar chautarafa padegaa
 The situation has become such that its own market is crying its credibility because the rupee is turning against the rupee due to the constantly falling price against the dollar
 rupee ke mukaable dollar jaise dollar nahin sona ho gaya ho
 Tears of rupees would have been limited to just this piece of paper, then there would have been something
 sabhi jaanate hai ki puure desh kaa kaarobaar isi rupee par tikaa he, lihaaja rupee ke peeche jaar-jaar kar ro rahaa he bazaar, daraa or sahamaa hua he aam aadmi
 However, very few people understand why this dollar decides the value of our rupee
 dollar ke mukaable rupee kii keemat girane kaa matlab kya he
 So it can be understood in simple language
 kyon girtaa he rupee kaa bhav?rupee ke bhav girane kii mukhya vajah hoti he desh ke khajaane main dollar kii kami
 Now the question is why there is a shortage of dollars, so it is because of the increase in imports
 kyonki jitna aayaat badhegaa, utana hi zyada dollar kaa kharchaa badhegaa
 The bulk of the country's total imports are spent on purchasing crude oil
 international market main kachche tel kii keemten badhane se saath dollar kaa kharch badhata chalaa jaataa he
 But this does not mean that the lack of dollar in the country is only due to increase in the prices of crude oil
 isaki vajahen or bhi he, jise sarkaar kaabo main kar sakati hai, lekin prati dollar 61 rupee kaa ricard rate paar karne ke baad bhi sarkaar soi dikh rahi he
 In the last one month, the rupee has been creating a new record of decline every day
 lekin vitt mantri se lekar pradhanmantri tak kehete sune jate hai, ki isse ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin
 While knowing the people, if the situation of the rupee depreciates, then not only will the business be affected, but the life of the common man will also be difficult
 yani rupee kaa ronaa jaise jaise badhate jayega, aam aadmi kii mumsibataan badhati jaaengi
 First of all, Indian oil companies pressurize the prices of petrol, diesel and gas due to the expensive dollar
 agar aisa hota he, to duusari chizon kii keemat buree tarah se prabhavit hoti he
 That is, inflation and sky will start touching the tears of the rupee
 kaise rukegi rupee kii rulaai?*aayaat ke mukaable niryaat ko badhaava dena hoga
 * Long-stuck NRI bonds will have to be approved
 *videshon main non trade pement par ankush lagaana hoga
 * An order to recall money placed abroad can also be effective
 *kachche tel kii kharidari par rigerv bank ko dollar kii diarect funding kerani hogi
 The government's effort in this direction seems to be only one, raising the custom duty on gold imports
 dollar kaa bhandar badhaane kaa doosraa kargar tarika epadiai bhi ho saktaa tha, lekin vipaksh ke virodh ke baad ye bhi adhar main lataka he
 In such a situation, there is no doubt that the Indian rupee may weaken further

 Vijay Rupani will be the new Chief Minister of Gujarat
 anandiben patel ke istife ke baad se gujarat ke nae mukhyamantri ko lekar bijepi kii maathapai sulajh gai he
 Rupani's name was announced after a meeting of the party's legislature party at the Gandhinagar BJP office on Friday evening
 iske saath hi ab tak siem kii res main sabase aage maane jane vaale nitin patel ko dipti siem banaaya jayega
 Rupani will take oath on Sunday
 aise bani batbijepi vidhayak dal kii baithak main rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah, sadak parivahan mantri nitin gadakari or anandiben patel ne bhi shirkat kii
 It is said that in the meeting of the legislature party about the name of CM, there was a dispute between Anandiben and Amit Shah
 shah rupani ko siem banane par ade the to anandi nitin ko apana uttaradhikari bananaa chaahati thim
 Then v Satish called PM Modi and Anandiben was called to him
 aakhirkaar amit shah ke kareebi maane jane vaale vijay rupani ko siem or nitin patel ko dipti siem banane ke formule par sahmati bani
 Anandiben, who could not do it, will have to do that, Rupani is going to sit on the throne of the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Vijay Rupani's next path will not be easy
 unhen wo kaam karne honge, jo anandiben na kar sakin
 The most important tasks for Rupani include giving good governance, pacifying the angry Patel and Dalit community who are angry with the government and strengthening the relationship between the government and the party
 bijepi ko mukhyamantri pad ke liye aise chehre kii sakht jarurat thi jo patidaaron or daliton ko shant kar sake
 But this work will not be easy for Rupani due to coming from non-patidar community
 koun hai vijay rupani?anandiben patel ke istife ke baad vijay rupani ko gujarat ke agle mukhyamantri ke taur par chunaa gaya he
 Gujarat BJP President Vijay Rupani has a good hold in the organization
 rupani rajkot pashchim se vidhayak hai
 He also has ministries like Transport, Water Supply and Labor and Employment in the Government of Gujarat
 anubhav ke saath hi vishwasaneey cheharaa hai rupanianandiben ke gujarat ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad rajya main party kaa sanghathan kamjor ho rahaa tha
 The bjp's internal mobilization was going to the high command
 yahi vajah thi ki sanghathan ko majboot banane ke liye vijay rupani ko adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 However, Vijay Rupani himself is also in the role of Transport Minister in the government
 aise main sarkaar chalaane kaa anubhav bhi unke paas kareeb ek saal kaa he
 Rupanivijay Rupani's name is also close to Shah, because he was one of the close ones of Amit Shah
 saath hi sarkaar or sanghathan kaa samanvay wo bakhubi kar rahe hai
 Even in the last days, all the important schemes of the government were announced by Vijay Rupani in place of Anandiben Patel
 haalanki jaankaar ye bhi maan rahe hai ki gaiyr-patidaar samudaay se mukhyamantri banaae jane par bijepi ko gujarat main patidaar voton kaa nuksaan bhi jhelana pad saktaa he
 On the other hand, Patel is the favorite of PM Modi, on the other hand, the current Health Minister in the Gujarat government elected as Deputy CM, Patel is the Prime Minister
 narendra modiki anandiben patel ke baad nitin patel pehali pasand bataae ja rahe the
 Recently, after political upheaval, Anandiben Patel expressed her desire to step down from the post of Chief Minister of Gujarat through social media
 gujarat sarkaar main sabase anbhavi mantri hai patelnitin patel gujarat main aaj ke rajnatik halaat sabase behatar mukhyamantri pad ummidavaar bataae ja rahe the
 According to sources, PM Modi's choice Nitin Patel was also because he is currently the most experienced and senior minister in the Gujarat government
 duusari baat jo nitin patel ke paksh main jaati thi wo ye ki wo samay-samay par gujarat sarkaar ke sabhi vibhaagon ke mantri rah chuke hai
 The party's eye on the assembly elections is Patel, who hails from Mehsanda district of Gujarat and Mehsanda is a stronghold of the Patidar movement
 party netritv kaa ye bhi maananaa tha ki nitin patel ko mukhyamantri banane se patidaar andolan kamjor padegaa
 The party also believed that the Patidar movement would once again pick up speed by replacing Patel with a leader of another caste

 Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, who has been taunting Narendra Modi for not wearing the cap that is prevalent in the Muslim community, has now flatly refused to cover his head in the gurdwara, which has led to a new controversy
 darasal, guuruuvaar ko nitish patna city sthit prasiddh gurudwara gaye the, jahaan sikhon ke dasven guru govind singh kaa janm hua tha
 He was to inaugurate the new rest house there
 gurudwara cameti ke mutabik, parisar main ghuste vakt jab nitish ko sir dhakne ko kaha gaya, to unhone isse manaa kar diya
 Not only this, Nitish's excuse of not covering his head is even more absurd
 unhone kaha ki unki tabiyat thik nahin he
 The CM stayed at the gurdwara for a few minutes
 is dauraan unka sir puri tarah khulaa hi tha
 After Nitish left from there, the Gurdwara Management Committee expressed his opposition
 management ne kaha ki siem ne sikh samudaay ke prati asammaan dikhaaya he, jo galat he
 The General Secretary of the Gurdwara Committee, Sardar Charanjit Singh said, 'when someone comes to the Gurdwara, he covers his head
 nitish ko bhi aisa karnaa chahie tha, lekin unhone nahin kiya
 This is a clear violation of the protocol of the Sikh community
 'baharhaal, siem ke khilaaf vipaksh ko baithe-bithaae ek acha mudda haath lag gaya he
 The opposition took a dig at Nitish and said that the 'secular' face of the Chief Minister has come to light from this incident
 gauratlab he ki ek samaaroh ke dauraan muslim samudaay main prachlit topi pahanane se inkaar karne ke baad narendra modi pehle hi khub acholana jhel chuke hai
 Let me tell you that at that time Nitish had criticized Modi and said, 'in politics, sometimes one has to wear a hat and sometimes a vaccine is also required
 'ab nitish ne isi tarah ke nae vivaad ko janm de diya he
 This issue is expected to dominate the political corridors

 Pawar said in Mumbai, 'rahul was ridiculed a lot by the people in power, but today it is being turned upside down
 log ab unhen sweekaar kar rahe hai or unki reliyon main baari bheed dekhi ja sakati he
 'rahul is running a fast campaign to create an atmosphere in favor of the party in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat
 yahaan agle maheene chunaav hone hai, unhone kaha, ‘puraa maahaul bijepi ke khilaaf he
 But money power and the government sitting at the center can do anything possible

 YES BANK FIRST BRANCH OPENED IN MUMBAI 2004: YES BANK'S FIRST REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IN ABUSABHI In 2015, the name of a private bank in Mumbai, the country's financial capital, suddenly came to the center of discussion
 darasal, is nijee bank ke naam 'yes' ne logon ko aakarshith kiya
 This was the first time that the interest in a bank's name was noticed
 kuch hi saalon main Yes bank ek janaa pahachaanaa naam ban gaya
 But Yes Bank, which is among the most popular private banks in the country, is going through a crisis today
 sankat kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki ek saal pehle is bank main jin niveshkon ne paise lagaae hai unke 90 fisadi se adhik paise dub chuke hai
 Talking about market capital, it has decreased by more than 70 thousand crores
 halaat ye ho gaye hai ki ek saal pehle tak yas bank ke jo share 400 rupee se adhik main bik rahe the uski keemat ab sirf 30 rupee rah gai he
 Now the situation has become such that promoters in the bank are also selling their stake
 
 However, let's know about this 16-year-old 'kishore' Yas Bank's journey from the past till now
 
 
 
 What happened when? - In November 2003, a banker Rana Kapoor and his relative Ashok Kapoor started Yes Bank together
 - agast 2004 main mumbai main yas bank kii pehali branch khuli
 - In June 2005, the initial public offering of the bank was launched for the general public
 - november 2005 main yas bank ke founder rana kapur ko enterpranyor of da year award mila
 - In March 2006, the bank announced its first financial year results

 - Bank promoter Ashok Kapoor killed in Mumbai terror attack on 26 November 2008
 - disambar 2009 main yas bank ko 30,000 karod ke balanceshit ke saatha sabase tej growth kaa award mila
 In June 2013, the bank decided to expand more than 500 branches in different states of the country
 - may 2014 main bank ne global qualiphoid institutional placement (kuypi) ke jariye 500 million dollar jutaaye
 In March 2015, Yes Bank was listed on the Nifty 50 of National Stock Exchange
 - april 2015 main yas bank ne pehla antarrashtriya pratinidhi karyaalay abudhabi main kholaa
 4906 through QIP in the year 2017
 68 karod rupee jutaaye
 This is the highest amount raised by any private sector
 - saal 2018 main yas bank ko securities bijness ke castodian ke liye sebi se license mila
 Apart from this, SEBI also gave approval for mutual fund business
 - aaj bank ke paas 21 hajaar se adhik karmchaaree hai
 The battle for supremacy reached in the number of employees also, the battle of supremacy was also seen after the death of another promoter of Yes Bank, Ashok Kapoor in the Mumbai terror attack on 26 November 2008
 darasal, ashok kapur kii maut ke baad patni madhu kapur chaahati thim ki beti ko bank ke board main shaamil kiya jaae
 This demand of Madhu Kapoor was rejected
 iske baad maamla bombai hoicourt main pahunch gaya
 The Bombay High Court also rejected Madhu Kapoor's plea in 2011 seeking permission to induct his daughter Shagun into the bank's board

 While Rana Kapoor has completed her studies from Delhi University
 rana kapur ko forbs ne duniya ke sabase amir bankers kii suchi main bhi shaamil kiya he
 Why this condition of Yes Bank? Actually, Reserve Bank of India took action on Yes Bank due to the possibility of disturbances in NPA and balance sheet
 is vajah se yas bank ke chairman rana kapur ko pad se hatana padaa
 At the same time, the bank was not able to raise funds according to the expectation through qualified institutional placement (QIP)
 is maahaul main duniya bhar kii reating agenciyaan bank ko negative marking dene lagi hai
 Apart from this, the ups and downs in the management of Yes Bank have also affected the health of the bank

 For 2019, all parties are gearing up
 modi sarkaar ko phir se satta par kabiz hone se rokane ke liye sabhi virdohi dal ek paale main aa khadey hue hai
 On the completion of 4 years of central government, a survey has tried to capture the mood of the country
 is survey ke mutabik modi sarkaar 2019 main phir se paracham laharaayegi, lekin is baar camel khilanaa 2014 jitna aasaan nahin rahegaa
 Rahul Gandhi's popularity increases According to this survey by ABP news-lokniti-csds, Modi is still the most popular leader
 lekin khaas baat ye he ki rahul gandhi kii lokapriyata main ijapha hua he
 The survey was conducted on 28 April 2018 to 17 May 2018 based on interactions with 15859 people in 19 states
 49 siton kaa endie ko ho saktaa he nuksansurve ke mutabik 543 loksabhaa seat par agar aaj chunaav hon to endie ko 274, upie ko 164 or anya ko 105 siten mil sakati hai
 If you compare it with 2014, NDA is seen to have lost 49 seats, while UPA is in big gains this time
 chunaav kii surat main upie ko 104 siten adhik mil sakati hai
 Other parties may lose 48 seats
 sahyogiyon kaa saath aichhik nahin, is baar anivaarysiton ke ganit main saaf jaahir he ki is baar bijepi ke liye apane dam par sarkaar bananaa mushkil he
 If you want to sit on the chair of Delhi, then this time it may be mandatory for the BJP, not with the help of allies
 vot pratishat kii ye he sthitivot pratishat ke lihaaj se dekhen to is baar endie ko 37%, upie ko 31% or anya dalon ko 32% vot milane kaa anumaan he
 The BJP may get relatively few votes in North, West and Central India
 vipakshi dalon ne haath milaayaa to mushkilbijepi kaa vijay rath rokane ke liye jis tarah se karnataka main sabhi pramukh vipakshi dalon ne haath milaayaa he, agar 2019 ke siyaasi maidan main bhi sabhi vipakshi dal aise hi milakar rahe to bijepi ke liye raah thodi kathin ho jaaegi
 However, they cannot be removed from power
 upi main akhilesh-mayawati kii sangat dikhaaegi rangathupi main agar mahagathbandhan hua to endie ko 8 fisadi vot kam mil saktaa he
 That is, in 2014, 43% of the vote will be reduced to 35%
 upi main akhilesh or mayawati saath chunaav lade to unhen 4 pratishat zyada vot milegaa
 According to the survey, UPA can get 12% and others (sp-bsp-other Parties) can get around 53% votes
 rajasthan main bhi 10 fisadi voton kaa nuksaanmahagathbandhan sirf upi main hi nahin, anya rajyon main bhi bijepi ke liye pareshaani badha saktaa he
 Even in Rajasthan, the NDA may lose 10 per cent of the vote share
 2014 main mili 55 fisadi vot is chunaav main 45 fisadi hi rah sakate hai
 At the same time, UPA can live in profit
 is baar upie 12 pratishat badhat ke saath kul 30 fisadi vot hasil kar sakati he
 In Eastern India, BJP is expected to get more than 90 seats out of 142 seats in eastern India in the survey
 vahiin upie yahaan kamjor dikh rahi he
 The UPA can get only 22-26 seats from the Northeast while the others can get 26-30 seats
 yani 2014 se tulana karen to is baar yahaan bijepi pehle se adhik majboot he
 BJP may get 32 seats more this time
 bihar main nitish kumaar kaa endie ke saath aana bhi bijepi ke liye phaayde kaa sauda hota dikh rahaa he
 Talking of 'didi' on the edge of BJP in Bengal, in West Bengal, the NDA may get 24 percent this time, UPA 11 and others 65 percent
 endie ko yahaan 2014 main sirf 17 fisadi vot mili the
 Even today, the ruling party TMC is the largest party
 madhya pradesh main kam ho saktaa he vot pratishtapaschim or madhya bharat main 118 siton main se endie ko 70 se adhik siten mil sakati hai
 The UPA is looking to get 47 to 41 seats
 is baar madhya pradesh se bijepi ko zyada nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Here the party may get 14 percent less votes than in 2014
 gujarat main bhi ho saktaa he nuksansurve main piem modi ke rajya gujarat main endie ke khate main 54 fisadi or upie ke khate main 42 fisadi vot aate dikh rahe hai
 In 2014, the BJP alliance got 59% votes in Gujarat, while the Congress alliance got 33% votes
 is baar yahaan se bijepi ko 5 pratishat kam vot mil saktaa he
 This will directly benefit the Congress, whose vote percentage can increase by 9%
 dakshin bharat main upie ko phaaydadakshin bharat kii baat karen to yahaan ke 6 rajyon kii 132 siton par endie ko nuksaan ho saktaa he
 The NDA is likely to get only 18 to 22 seats, UPA 65 to 75 and others 38 to 44 seats
 pichley chunaav main yahaan se endie ko 23, upie ko 21 or anya ko 88 siten milin thim

 Delhi's Buradikand is going to complete one year
 buraadi ke us ghar main ek hi parivaar ke 11 logon kii maut se puraa desh dahal gaya tha
 Investigation had revealed that the whole family had taken this dreadful step in the affair of some soul, superstition and tantra-mantra
 is vaardaat ke baad se hi wo ghar ke logon ke liye 'manahuus' ho gaya tha
 Nobody even thinks of staying in that house, passing away
 lekin upi ke do bhaiyon ne us ghar main rahanaa shuru kar diya
 People of this area are surprised by this
 buraadi cond ke baad pichley saal 14 oktober ko wo ghar parivaar ke ekmaatr jivit sadsy dinesh ne rahane ke liye apane do parichiton ko de diya tha
 When both of their brothers came to live in this house, they were told many horror stories about this house by the neighbors
 kai ne unhen us ghar main rahane se rokane kii koshish bhi kii
 But the two brothers decided that they would live in the same house
 ek dainik kii report ke anusaar alokik shaktiyon or anjaan takaton ke ghar main hone kii afvaahon ke bich ahamed ali or afasar ali naam ke do bhai us ghar main rah rahe hai
 Both these brothers have known the family of the deceased for about 8 years
 30 varshiya ahamed ali kehete hai ki agar koi unke faisle par sawaal uthaata he, to ve sawaal karne vaale se poochhate hai ki kya unhone apane pariwaron main kisi maut ke baad apane ghar khaali kar die the
 He says that people react strangely to his stay in this house
 dinesh chundavat or unka parivaar ali bandhuon se pehle do raaton ke liye is ghar main rahaa tha
 After this, he shifted
 jabaki unke baad vahaan rahane aae ali bandhu adhikansh andhvishwaas kii baton ko nazarandaaj karte hai
 While those living nearby believe that 'spirits' come out in that house at midnight
 afasar ali ne is bare main bataaya ki bareli main unke gaanv main bhi yah ek vyapak dharna he
 But he goes to the terrace at midnight after having dinner because of his schedule
 donon bhai bataate hai ki jab unhone buraadi main us main jane kaa faisla kiya, to unke apane parivaar ne bhi kadaa virodh kiya tha
 Because their householders did not want both of them to live in that ill-fated house
 is ghar main akele kai raaten bitaane vaale ahamed ke mutabik un donon ne bataaya ki ve kabhi-kabhi apane saath kaam karne vaale saathiyon ko bhi vahaan bulaate hai
 But keep the people living nearby
 kyonki vahaan ke zyaadaatar log unhen keval daraane kii koshish karte rahete hai
 The most surprising thing is that till now only the creepy and intimidating stories about that house came out as a rumor
 lekin ab us ghar ke bik jane kii afvaah bhi teji se fail rahi he
 According to experts, the price of that house today is more than 125 million

 pakistan kii 2,000 website hack, havers ne bataaya international teror de This is the first time after the formation of a separate state of Uttarakhand that an MP from the state has been made a cabinet minister directly at the center
 iske pehle harish ravat upie sarkaar main pehle rajyamantri or phir cabinet mantri bane the
 But Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank is celebrating happiness in Uttarakhand by becoming cabinet minister of important things like human resource development in Modi government
 mahatvapurn mantralay milane se narendra modi or amit shah se nishank kii najdiki baxi tay he
 This may also increase the anxiety among the leaders of the anti-bjp factions of the state
 ab tak bhaajapa ke pradesh main sabhi guton main yahi sandesh tha ki mukhyamantri trivendra ravat hi amit shah ke kareebi hai
 Now the BJP leaders of the state are also inclined towards Nishank
 pradesh ke jin netaaon yaa vidhayakon ko apni baat rajya leadership kii manamanion se tang aakar upar tak pahunchaani hogi, ab nishank unke liye bhi ek pul kaa kaam kar sakenge
 This can make the leaders in the state, who consider themselves as surveyors, uncomfortable
 lihaaja, ve nishank ke khilaaf ekajute bhi ho sakate hai
 The BJP central leadership's decision to make Nishank a cabinet minister is being seen as an attempt to balance the power in the state
 nishank haridwar kii numaaindgi karte hai or yah is pahari rajya kaa maidani bhubhag he
 Therefore, the central leadership has also indicated to care about the plains associated with the state
 mahatvapurn baat yah bhi he ki uttarakhand main kshetreey, jatigat, saamaajik or gutiy santulan ko bhi saadhaa gaya he
 Though he was also named in the previous government for the post of minister, the problem at the center was that three former chief ministers were in the race
 pradesh se ek rajyamantri banane main almoda se jite ajay tamata ko kamyaabi mil gai
 Nishank's coronation has also got a support to those mlas who were unhappy with the Chief Minister's arbitrariness after getting a strong majority in the state

 *** Some researchers claim to have invented such technology that grass can be converted into bio-fuel and used as airplane fuel
 belgium main ghent vishvavidhyalay ke vaigyanik kern khor ne bataaya ki abhi tak jameen par ugane vaali ghaas kaa upyog jaanwaron ke chaare ke rup main hota rahaa he, lekin ab ghaas ko jaev-eendhan ke rup main bhi prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 In its inspection method, Khor sliced the grass and tested it until it could be used as fuel

 Lactic acid, as an intense chemical, helps to produce compounds such as biodigability plastic (PLA) and fuel
 vaastaviktaa main badalane ke liye abhi kaaphi kaam karnaa baakeeis lactic amla ko baad main caproic amla main parivartit kiya jaataa he or ise aage deken main badla jaataa he
 It is then used as an aircraft fuel
 vaigyanik khor bataate hai ki haalanki yah kadam krantikari he, lekin ise vaastaviktaa main badalane ke liye abhi bahut kuch kiya janaa baaki he
 He further states that so far only some amount of grass can be converted into bio-fuel
 haal kii yah pranali kaaphi mahangi he or mashiinon ko is nai pranali ko apnaanaa chahie
 In a statement issued by Ghent University, scientist Khor said, 'if we are optimistic, we can take our work forward in collaboration with the business world
 ham is nai takanic kii keemton ko kuch kam kar sakate hai or sambhav he ki kuch saalon main ham sab ghaas kii madad se udaan bharen

 P
 singh ne unhen us seat par chunauti di thi jise amitabh bachchan ne khaali kar diya tha
 After that the direction of Indian politics changed and the vote bank of Congress started in the Hindi heartland of the country
 lekin is 27 saal puraani kahani ke murde ham isiilie nahin ukhaad rahe hai, dilli main ab waisi hi milti-julati kahani doharaai ja rahi he
 Ok v pi
 Like Singh, Arvind Kejriwal is challenging a national party at the peak of its strength, in which he is supported by various socialist, nationalist, resistant and left-lohian-liberal intellectuals
 jaisaa elahabaad main 1988 main hua tha, agar kejariwal yah ladaai jeet jate hai to usamen bhartiya raajnneeti main haal hi main bane nae santulan ko gadabadane kii puri kuwvat he
 He does not have to face his electoral rival Kiran Bedi or even BJP
 saamana pradhanmantri narendra modi se he
 Bedi is his heroine in the same way that Sunil Shastri was in Rajiv Gandhi in 1988 in Allahabad
 jis tarah se bijepi ne ab bedi kaa istemaal karke matadaataaon ko yah yaad dilaane kii koshish kii he ki ve bhi kejariwal kii hi tarah activist rahi hai or usne ise do puraane rajnatik saathiyon ke bich mukaable main tabdeel karne kii koshish kii he, usee tarah us samay congress ne raajnneeti main eemaandaaree va saralata kaa pratimaan maane jane vaale laal bahadur shastri ke putr sunil ko ve
 P
 singh ke khilaaf utaara jinhen shastri ji apana paanchvaan betaa maanate the or jinhone apni zyaadaatar pushtaini sampatti shastri ji ke trust ke naam kar di thi
 Here too, the motive was to counter 'original' versus 'fake'
 donon hi maamalon main bade dakhal vaali party apane sarvocch netaa or nai party ke bich sidhi takkar se bachati rahi
 This idea was not successful even then, it will not happen this time either
 main itani morrkhtaa nahin dikhaaungaa ki matganana ke din savere 11 baje se pehle hi nattejey ke bare main bhavishyavaanee karne laguun, bhale hi tamaam janamat surveykshan kuch bhi kahen jinamein ek india today samooh kaa bhi he (jisamen aap kii jeet ke sanket hai), lekin itnaa main kah saktaa hum ki pehla daur nishchit rup se kejariwal ke naam gaya he
 He has followed Modi every step for almost a year, which even the adventurous Rahul Gandhi could never show
 unhone varanasi se chunaav ladaa or duusare sthaan par rahe
 This in itself was a message that the traditional anti-bjp vote of the Congress was going to Kejriwal
 yah bhi ki uttar pradesh ke musalmaan matadaataaon ke paas samaajawaadee party ke alaava bhi ek vikalp he
 So whatever the result is on 10 February, they forced Modi and BJP to bow their eyes first in Delhi
 desh kii sabase majboot or sabase vichaardhaaratmak kader-aadhaarit rashtriya party ko jang se kuch hafton pehle apane senapati badalane pade or kejariwal se ladane ke liye haal hi ke anna andolan se ek dalbadalu udhaar lenaa padaa
 We can understand that due to a lack of confidence in Delhi, the BJP wanted to prevent it from becoming a Modi versus Kejriwal fight
 lekin jab hawa kaa rukh saaf palata hua najar aane laga to uske paas bedi ko khamosh karke modi ko puure akraman ke saath utaarne ke alaava koi vikalp nahin bachaa
 In the language of cricket, it was as if a night watchman should be played to play the last four overs of the day in order to save his main batsman in the waning light
 phir nite wochaman pehali hi gend par out ho jaae
 Kejriwal is making the spectacle of this nervousness more in BJP than anything else in his campaign
 yahi vajah he ki kisi haasyaaspad funding kaa masalaa aap ke samarthakon ko usee tarah kaa majaa de rahaa he jaisaa kabhi saint kits ke maamle ne ve
 P
 singh ke samarthakon ko diya tha
 However, the greater similarity lies in publicity issues, methods and symbols

 His campaign was also openly supported by the RSS such as V

 Gave it to Singh

 He was also successful at that time but V

 Singh became the main enemy of the RSS / BJP, just as Kejriwal has become

 Singh's simple headdress, milk flask and motorcycle were all tools of this grassroots politics
 isi tarah kejariwal kii bina aakaar kii topi (meri ichha thi ki aap ne vaxd paper kii gaiyr-biodegradable topi kii jagah, jisaki nakal ab bijepi kar rahi he, khaadi kaa istemaal kiya hota), mafalar or khaansee he

 Many of Singh's strategists and campaigners were also noted 'socialist' journalists and editors

 And then at his old mansion in Allahabad, various advisors gathered every evening to formulate the plan for the fall of Rajiv Gandhi

 It seems like something heard and heard! This is no different from Kejriwal's usual apartment late evening in Kaushambi, east of Delhi
 bahut rochak va prabhavi tulana style se zyada bhashaa or pratikon main he

 Singh did not get tired of explaining Bofors in remote villages of rural Allahabad, even in the scorching heat of that decade (after the terrible drought of 1986)
 ve kehete the, aapke gharon main send lag gai he
 how? They then dramatically took out matches from the pocket of their kurtas
 jab aap chaar aane (25 paise) kharch karke maachis kharidte hai, bidi kaa bandal kharidte hai yaa thodaa-sa gud lete hai to usamen bhi ek-do paise sarkaar ke paas tex ke rup main jate hai
 With this money of yours, the government builds schools, makes hospitals and buys guns for your army
 agar isamen kuch paisa dallali main liya jaae to yah aapke ghar main send lagane ke baraabar hua na? yah congress ke un aalochakon ke jawaab main unka jawaab tha jo yah kahkar unka majaak udaaya karte the ki dur-daraaj ke gaanvon main boforce koun samajhataa he?kejariwal ne bhi chote-bade bhrashtachar or gaiyr-barabari par apni aawaaj ko utani hi aasaani se samajhe jane laayak saral banaaya he
 In his saying that 'all these are met' ok
 pi
 The echo of Singh's 'your homes have been broken' is heard
 agar aap ke shrotaaon main kisi avaidh colony yaa jhuggi main amanviya sthitiyon main rahane vaala dilli kaa vah nichalaa varg he jo apni aay se bhi badtar jivan gujaarne ke liye majaboor he, to vah kejariwal ke mithkon ko aasaani se samajhegaa
 They say that the BJP and Congress have met the builders, so they will destroy all the slums and throw you on the streets because they know that in ten weeks you will be tired and return to your villages, even if the slums are in a bad sense Desolate, but in reality no city leaves
 iske baad kejariwal apane 49 din ke shashan kii tulana main subjiyon ke aaj ke bhav bataate hai
 Cabbage at that time Rs 8

 The way V
 despite the Western and feudal impressions

 Singh got a new vote bank among the rural poor, Muslims and backward classes, in the same way Kejriwal has established his special new base in the vast lower class in a rapidly urbanizing India
 agar adwani ne jati ke khilaaf hindutv ko khadaa karke ve
 P
 singh ko maat di to kejariwal bhi varg se hindutv, modithv or alpsankhyakwaad se lard rahe hai
 If they succeed, it will be the first new big idea in our politics after Mandal, Mandir and Modiism

 bachi-khuchi saakh wo mohali mentim indiyake jeet ke tisare mukke ke saath hi ganvaa baithe hai
 Now stopping the victory of Team India moving towards No
 2 is not a matter of their bus
 mohali main mili aitihaasik jeet ke baad jashn ke lamhe thamane kaa naam nahin le rahe
 Because these are the memorable moments of Team India's victory victory on the journey of creating history
 is jeet ne test ke nae temparament vaali peedi kii takat dikhaai he to kangaaroon kaa gurur chur karne kii himmat bhi
 On his pitch, the way Dhoni's men have demonstrated their strength among their people is a commendable compliment
 captain ne kamaal kii captaini kii, jis par bharosa kiya, wo khara utraa or jise mauka mila, usne mauka bhunaane ke liye jaan ladaa di
 Mohali has been a lucky ground for Team India anyway and on this ground India has put a hat-trick of victory
 ye vahi maidan he jahaan australia bharat ko kabhi bhi maat dene main kaamyaab nahin ho sakaa he
 The bad kangaroos can be gauged from the fact that for the first time since 1970, Australia have lost 0–3 in the series and all four are on the verge of getting upset
 mohali kii jeet ke saath hi captain emes dhoni ne bharat main australia par jeet ke apane sau fisadi record ko bhi kaayam rakhaa he
 Captain Dhoni has won all the seven Tests played against Australia at home
 shikhar dhawanaustralia kaa kila dhwast karke team india ne apana sabase bada sapana saakaar kar liya he
 Mohali greats Shikhar Dhawan is certainly at the forefront and Shikhar will definitely come in the dream of the Australian team
 team india ko test main shikhar mila to, nae sapane, nai ummiden, ankhon main nai chamak ke saath tairne lage
 Shikhar Dhawan has become Mohali's greatest magnate by playing an innings of 187 runs against Australia in the third and first Test of his career
 test cricket main jeet kii hetric or wo bhi australia ke khilaaf
 Hardly anyone in the world would have thought that Team India would show this charisma too
 lekin ye sab hua or duniya ise dekh rahi he
 The world is admiring the peak, because if there were no peak in the four-day game, there would be no hat trick
 mahaj 85 gendon main shikhar ne apni jindagi ke pehle test main pehla test shatak thok diya
 No one in the world has ever scored a faster century in his first Test
 shikhar dhawan ne mohali test main 174 gendon par 187 ranon kii vishaal pari kheli
 Shikhar Dhawan hit 33 fours and 2 sixes
 or strike rate rahaa 107
 47
 shikhar ne sirf record hi dhwast nahin kiya, balki bharat ke liye nae records kii jhadi laga di
 Before the summit, no Indian opener scored a century in his first match
 kisi bhi bhartiya ballebaaj ne pehle match main hi ek satr ke bheetar shatak puraa nahin kiya tha
 But Shikhar credits his record-breaking innings with this great hero, to his lucky charm wife Ayesha
 apni do betiyon ko or apane parivaar ko
 The selectors dropped Sehwag from the team and gave Shikhar Dhawan a chance
 kehete hai vakt badalte der nahin lagati
 When Shikhar Dhawan got a chance, he proved that he is Surma
 pichley saal 30 oktober ko dilli shahar main shikhar ne australia kii aaysha ko hameshaa ke liye apana bana liya tha
 Just then this batsman's luck left the slow track and caught the Superfast Express of success
 aaysha se shaadi ke baad hi shikhar ko pehali baar hindustan ke liye test cricket khilne kaa mauka mila
 Now it would be called a coincidence that for the first time, even if he got a chance to show up in the field wearing a baggy blue cap
 apni sasuraal kii team ke khilaaf or test maidan par utarate hi shikhar kaa ladi lack chal niklaa
 Meeting this bright star of his destiny was also a beautiful coincidence for Shikhar
 aaysha team india ke turbanetor harbhajan singh kii frands list main pehle se maujuud thi
 Cupid fixing Shikhar and Ayesha's lovematch was none other than Bhajji himself
 ek dilli kaa damdaar cricketer, duusari australia kii shaukia boxr
 The hobbies of both were also similar, both tattoo lovers, both fond of films, it didn't take much time to be friends
 lekin shikhar kaa dil lagaataar aaysha ke liye kah rahaa tha ye dil maange mor
 What was Ayesha's approval? In 2009, both of them got engaged and finally in 2012, Shikhar got married and made Ayesha forever
 aaysha kaa aana tha ki donon kii jindagi main do pyaari betiyon kaa bhi aana ho gaya
 It is here that the golden harf of success began to be added to Shikhar's book of luck
 aaj shikhar kii is kaamayaabi par sirf aaysha hi nahin, balki unke parivaar ko bhi behad naaj he
 The father's chest has swelled with pride at the performance of his son who started the journey from the summit
 jahaan pita ko naaj he to vahiin shikhar kii maa bhi foole nahin samaa raheen
 This mother probably named her son Shikhar probably for this reason
 ab maa ko intjaar he mohali kaa maidan jitkar bete ke ghar aane kaa taaki bete kaa manapsand raajma-chaaval or nonvez khaanaa apane haath se banaakar khilaa sake
 Not only the family but the whole nation is proud on this spunk of Delhi
 team india ke is jet suurama ne kangaaroon ko jaise collar pakadakar baitha diya he
 The beginning was excellent but the peak is more than just the stars
 murali vijaymohali ke duusare mahanayake se miliye
 Their identity is that their bat is very loud against Australia
 ji haa naam he murali vijay
 Murali has scored 3 centuries in his Test career so far and all three are against Australia
 guarantee jeet kii bhi lete hai ye janaab
 Murali scored a century in Mohali that made the Kangaroos and bowler Murali's wicket
 ab austelia kii samaj main bhi sidhe-sidhe aa gaya hoga ki murali kis bhalaa kaa naam he
 What happens if you stay on the field gendbaajon ke hosh phakhta or jeet par team india kaa naam hota he
 Murali Vijay led Team India's Vijay Rath and scored an impressive 153 runs in the first innings of the Mohali Test
 murali ne 317 gendo kaa saamana kiya, 19 chauke lagaae or 3 gaganchumbhi chakke bhi
 Murali Vijay's strike rate was 48
 26 kaa
 In 2010, Murali scored 139 runs in Bangalore and India won by 7 wickets
 2013 main murali ne hyderabad main 167 ranon kii pari kheli or match jeeta
 Now the innings of 153 runs played in Mohali and got a hat-trick of victory against Australia
 mahendra singh dhonidhoni, ab to lagata he ki jeet ke liye naam hi kaaphi he
 Under Dhoni's captaincy, Team India has got that which was not found under the captaincy of any captain till date
 australia kaa itnaa bura hashr kabhi nahin hua hua
 The Australian team underwent changes after losing in Hyderabad, their thuds all over Australia
 lekin phir bhi wo haar kii hetric nahin bachaa sake
 Today Dhoni's chest is being stretched with pride
 jo karishma australia ke khilaaf kisi captain ne nahin kiya wo dhoni ne kar dikhaaya he
 For the first time, a captain hit a hat-trick of victories against Australia
 dhoni team india ke sabase safal captain ban gaye hai
 Today the time is with Dhoni and also the record
 desh dhoni ke saath he or cricket ke tamaam phens bhi
 Dhoni's name is discussed among the veterans
 dhoni kii kamyaabi kaa dhol pit rahaa he
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni has won the 23rd Test match in Mohali, which testifies to Dhoni becoming captain number one
 saurav ganguli ne apni captaini main team india ko 21 test maichon main jeet dilaai or ab captain dhoni 23 test mainchon main team india ko jeet dilaa chuke hai
 While Muhammad Azharuddin holds the record for winning 14 Test matches to his name
 australia ke khilaaf dhoni kaa gharelu record bhi bemisaal he
 He took command in 7 matches against the Kangaroos and Team India has won all matches
 aaj sabakuch bhuulakar jashn manaane kaa din he
 Dhoni is the great hero of Mohali, he has a great reputation in the country
 dhoni ke in dhurandhar gendbaajon ko 4 din mili the, jeet ke liye or phir sabane milakar australia kii khatiya khadi kar di
 Four days of play and the entire team of Australia has been hit twice
 team india ke gendbaajon ne australia kaa wo haal kiya ki apane unhen sapane main bhi bhartiya gendbaaj khauf banakar sataayenge
 Ravindre Jadeja - 6 wickets - Ojha - 4 wickets Ashwin - 4 wickets - Bheshwanshwar Kumar - 3 wickets - Ishant Sharma - 3 wickets: India bowlers washed away Australia, in the first innings, Australia put on 408 runs
 lekin ekta or ekajutata ke aage ajtak koi nahin tik paaya he or phir aisa hi hua bhartiya gendbaajon ne lay pakadi, sirf phiraki hi nahi fast bolers ne bhi dam dikhaaya or australia ko jameen par dhadaam se gira diya
 And he became the great hero of Mohali
 mohali main australia ke khilaaf jeet badi he
 Because 4 days time was found and in that also Australia ate the first day and a half
 lekin jeet phir bhi team india ke naam he
 Ishant Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja pushed in the first innings against Australia and both took 3-3 wickets
 ojha or aswin kii phiraki bhi khaali nahin gai or donon ko 2-2 wicket mili
 But in the second innings, Bhubaneswar wreaked havoc on Australia and broke the backbone of the Kangaroos by Ravindra Jadeja
 donon ne 3-3 wicket liye
 In between, Ashwin and Ojha also played their part
 donon ke khate main 2-2 wicket gaye
 And thus Australia was able to challenge Team India by 133 runs on the fourth day

 But a group of senior bureaucrats behind them finalized the draft report recommending the cancellation of 53 of the 57 allocated coal blocks

 That the cag's estimate was not wrong
 nishchit taur par koyale ke aavanton main baari sadaandh punap chuki thi
 The Prime Minister emphatically stated in his statement in the Rajya Sabha on August 27 that there was no disturbance in the allocation

 unhone sadan ko bataaya tha ki ve apane mantralay ke faislon kii ‘’puri jimmedaari lete hai, lekin unhone kisi bhi gadabadi se inkaar kar diya
 The statements and facts of the Prime Minister collide with each other

 The PMO had sought its opinion on the viability of the auction in 2005 from the Law Ministry

 State governments are guilty of failure to form a consensus on the pm's statement
 tathyahaalanki unhone sweekaar kiya ki rajyon ko raji karne kaa pehla kadam 25 july, 2005 ko uthaaya tha
 States had lodged their objections till 2006, but nothing was done for three years while 31 coal blocks were allocated during this period

 pradhanmantri ne isamen hui deree kaa koi kaaran nahin bataaya
 Ministry of Coal between July to November, 2004 and November 2006 to May, 2009 manmohan singh ke paas rahaa
 During this period, the Minister of State always remained the Congress, which can be a shocking thing
