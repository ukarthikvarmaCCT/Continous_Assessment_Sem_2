 saamaajik kaaryakartianna hajarene kaha ki ucch stareey nyaaypalika ko samaaj dwaara prastavitalokapal vidheyakke daayre se baahar rakhaa jayega or vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar karne valismitimein unke pratinidhiyon kaa rukh ‘lacheela’ hoga
 Hazare, who is preparing to go to Delhi to attend the first meeting of the drafting ten-member committee, said that judges of the High Court and Supreme Court should be excluded from the purview of the Lokpal
 samiti main anna hajaare, unke dwaara manonith chaar sadsy or paanch cabinet mantri shaamil hai
 The committee will discuss the bill on Saturday under the chairmanship of Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee
 hajaare ne kaha ki vidheyak ke daayre main keval nichle str kii nyaaypalika ko hi rakhaa janaa chahie
 He said, 'the representatives of the society are legal experts and have long experience
 jahaan tak lacheele rukh kaa sawaal he to charchaa ke samay yah jaahir ho jayega
 He was asked whether the judges of the Supreme Court would also be kept under the ambit of 'jan Lok Pal' proposed by him
 gujarat or bihar ke mukhyamantri kramash: narendra modi or nitish kumaar kii prashansa ke kaaran aalochana kaa saamana kar rahe hajaare ne kaha ki unhone kabhi bhi sampradayik yaa vibhaajan kii raajnneeti kaa samarthan nahin kiya
 The social activist alleged that 'political and criminal forces' are trying to weaken it by denigrating and criticizing the nationwide movement in favor of Lokpal Bill
 hajaare ne kaha ki unhone gujarat main narendra modi or bihar main nitish kumaar kii sarkaron dwaara kiye vikaas kaaryon kii keval saraahna kii he
 He said, 'some people misunderstood my comments
 maine kabhi kisi sampradayik raajnneeti kaa yaa vibhaajan kii raajnneeti kaa samarthan nahin kiya
 Accusing political and criminal forces of undermining the nationwide movement against corruption, he said that these forces have become concerned with the overwhelming support of the common man getting the Jan Lokpal Bill
 hajaare ne naam liye bina kaha ki ye takatein bhram paidaa karne or andolan ko badnaam karne kii koshish kar rahi hai
 He was asked if some people see a glimpse of Gandhi in him, then does he consider himself the second Mahatma
 is par hajaare ne kaha, ‘main mahatma ke pairon kii dhul ke baraabar bhi nahin hum
 Yes, they have a very strong influence on my life
 ’samiti kii kaarywahi kii videography kii maang par hajaare ne kaha ki sarkaar janata kii sevak he or uske kaamkaaj main puri tarah paardarshita honi chahie
 He said, 'if anyone opposes the videography of the meeting, it means that his conscience is not clear
 logon ko vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar karne kii prakriya ke bare main jaanane kaa haq he
 That is why i favor videography of the proceedings
 ’hajaare se poocha gaya ki vah or unke samarthak jo kar rahe hai usase ek tarah se saansadon or sansad ke dayitvon kaa atikaraman hoga
 On this, Hazare said that this is a misunderstanding about his role
 unhone kaha, ‘saansad janata ke sevak hote hai
 He is sent to Parliament to make laws for the management of the economy and the welfare of society
 pichley 42 varshon main lokapal vidheyak paarit nahin kiya ja sakaa
 Failed eight times
 ab ise paarit karaane ke liye andolan chhedana janata kaa adhikaar he
 Hazare also dismissed the apprehension that the Lok Pal Institute proposed by the society would become an 'uncontrolled force'
 gandhivadi saamaajik kaaryakarta ne kaha, ‘lok paal or anya sadasyon kaa chayan ek ucch stareey samiti puri paardarshita se karegi
 He said that if a member of Lokpal is found guilty in any case, he will be removed in a month
 hajaare ne kaha tha ki yadi sansad main 15 agast tak lokapal vidheyak paarit nahin kiya jaataa he to vah phir se andolan karenge
 When asked about this, he said that there will be no delay as the deadline of June 30 has been set for drafting
 unke dwaara raajnneetik netaaon ko lekar diye gayi bayaan par ho rahi aalochanaon par saamaajik kaaryakarta ne kaha ki unhone kabhi bhi bharat ke sabhi rajanetaaon ko bhrasht nahin kaha
 Hazare said, 'there are very few exceptions at all levels
 lekin un apwaadon kaa tabhi sammaan kiya ja saktaa he jab vah apane najadik ho rahe bhrashtachar kii jaankaree hone par uske khilaaf aawaaj uthaaen
 Remaining silent on corruption is also to support corruption and politicians who fall into this category have virtually no use for the country
 ’raajnneetigyon or kuch matadaataaon ko kathith taur par bhrasht or beimaan kehane ke kaaran bhi hajaare ko congress or rakanpa kii kadi aalochanaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 In this case, a 73-year-old Gandhian philanthropist said that political parties and politicians are responsible for defaming the character of the voters of this country
 rajaneta saamaanya taur par kaale dhan kaa istemaal satta or chunaav ke dauraan matadaataaon ko paisa baantne ke liye karte hai
 He questioned, 'can today candidates with good qualities and good moral qualities win elections without the use of black money
 ’ kendriya mantri sharad pavaar ke bare main puche gaye ek sawaal par unhone kaha, ‘main ek vyakti ke taur par pavaar ke khilaaf nahin hum lekin vah jo pravriti darshaate hai, main uske khilaaf hum
 Hazare expressed his gratitude to the common man and the ngos for their support in the movement against corruption

 Especially on behalf of Shiv Sena, the BJP has been shown a mirror on all the issues
 ab jabaki donon partiyaan maharashtra main milakar vidhansabha chunaav lard rahi hai, aise main shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne phir ek baar gathbandhan ko lekar bayaan diya he
 Thackeray has said that he has compromised in an alliance with BJP for the betterment of Maharashtra
 saamana ke akjicutive editor sanjay raut ko die intervyuu main shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne kaha ki bijepi se shivasena kaa gathbandhan hindutv par aadhaarit he
 Thackeray also confessed that he has compromised to come to an alliance with the BJP, which is only for the good of Maharashtra
 thakare ne kaha, 'ham kam siton par lard rahe hai, kyonki devendra fadanvis or chandrakant patil ne mujhase apni samasya samajhane kii apil kii thi
 Even though the Shiv Sena is fighting on fewer seats, the party will win most of the seats
 ''shivasena kaa siem banane tak shant nahin baithunga'siem or dipti siem ke sawaal bhi uddhav thakare ne apni raay rakhi
 Thackeray said that he had spoken to his father (balasaheb Thackeray) that one day i will become the Chief Minister of Shiv Sena
 uddhav thakare ne kaha ki jab tak main apane pita ko diya hua vachan puraa nahin karata, tab tak shant nahin baithunga
 Will Aditya Thackeray be CM or Deputy CM? Uddhav Thackeray expressed his opinion on Aditya from his son and Thackeray family for the first time

 Four months ago, when BJP workers up to the ward level of Gujarat started raising funds for the party through the American-style open fund raising system (where receipts are given), hardly anyone knew that after a few months There can be a positive electoral issue for the upcoming elections
 adhiktar log ise desh ke haalia rajnatik itihaas main paardarshee tareeke se rajnatik chanda jutaney ke pehle gambhir prayaas ke rup main dekhenge
 The move, initiated by Narendra Modi's initiative, aims to reduce the party's dependence on big industrialists

 Up to or more than that amount is being given as donation and instead they are being given a receipt
 is abhiyaan kaa sabase sakaaratmak paksh yah he ki 60 fisadi paisa check ke rup main aa rahaa he
 An issue has emerged from this which was not seen before in the Indian political system
 gujarat bijepi ke koshadhyaksh surendra patel bataate hai, ''isse party kaaryakartaaon main garv kii bhaavana dekhi ja rahi he
 The reason for this is that till now the task of raising such large political donations has been considered as the field of leaders and not of the workers
 ''modi ne farvari main dinadayal upaadhyaay kii jayanti ke maukey par party padaadhikariyon kii baithak ko sambodhit karte hue is abhiyaan kii shuruyaat ke sanket de die the
 Modi had said, "why should we depend on big businessmen for funds?" i have no doubt that if we start a transparent campaign for election funds, it will be successful and we will move in the right direction to break the occupation of big businessmen on politics
 ''is abhiyaan main vidhayak se lekar panchayat sadasyon tak bijepi ke sabhi nirvaachit pratinidhi or ward str tak ke sabhi party padaadhikari shaamil hai
 For this, meetings were held at different levels to train the workers

 The system of distribution of donations collected in this way is also worker friendly
 jutaaye gaye fund kaa 25 pha sadi hissaa taluka or rajya bijepi ikai ko or shesh 50 fisadi hissaa jila ikai ko miltaa he
 At the taluka level, money can be withdrawn only after the signature of three office bearers
 rajya bijepi ke sachiv bharat pandya bataate hai, ''taluka str or usase neeche ke kaaryakarta ab sthaneey str par party ke kaaryakramon ke liye khud jutaaye paison kaa istemaal kar sakenge or unhen iske liye jila yaa pradesh ikai yaa kisi naapsand sthaneey kaarobaari se bheekh maangane kii jarurat nahin hogi

 What is the coincidence of women's clothes scattered from the road to the fields near the burnt vehicles at Murthal near Sonipat? Or is the story behind the gang rape of tens of women hidden under the cover of the movement? But when everything from khaki-wrapped laws to rulers in the Khaddar state, all put oil in their ears If you go, who will listen to the complaint of the people? Therefore, after the headlines of the newspapers, the evidence of the incident scattered in the form of clues, the priests sitting in the temple of justice themselves took the initiative to cover it

 Was she just a misdeed or did she take advantage of the compulsions of the people and gang-raped the women as well? When seeing everything, the police turned their eyes without trying to know the reality, questions were raised on this scene

 mumkin he ki is lutpaat ke dauraan vahaan kisi musafir kaa britaices tut kar gir gaya, jisase yekapade bikharagaye
 The police even say that if goons had committed gangrape with a girl here, then someone would have approached them with a complaint
 police to yahaan tak kah rahi he ki unhen naa to aisi kisi vaardaat kaa koi chashmadid mila or naa hi ab tak kii jaanch main aas-paas ke dhabon yaa dukaanon main lage sisitivi camaron main aisi kisi vaardaat kii tasviren milin
 But this refusal of the police seems weak at the moment of the argument
 sawaal ye he ki agar vahaan kapade kisi ke saath hui lutpaat ke dauraan hi gire, to sirfmahilaon ke kapadehi kyon mili? aisi surat main vahaan ladies under garments ke alaava duusari chije bhi padi honi chahie thim
 According to reports published in the newspaper, some women in naked condition had also reached the nearby dhaba to ask for help
 aarope to yahaan tak he ki police ne hi shikaayat ke liye ai mahilaon ko loklaj or kanoon kaa dar dikhaa kar thane se chalata kar diya tha
 While the police themselves believe that till now the investigation of all CCTV footage has not been completed
 das gangrape ke is sandigdh maamle main police ke kaam karne ke taur-tareeke par hi sabase bada sawaal he
 Perhaps in view of this, the High Court has not only termed this incident as shameful, but has even said that they also have the option to handover the case to CBI

 The BJP claimed that both the country and the world have accepted that the image, economy, development and goodwill of the country has been 'discounted' by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's nine-year rule, so he should step down from his post
 party pravaktaa ravishankar prasad ne america kii time patrika main singh ke bare main chape aalochanatmak lekh ke sandarbh main kaha, jo desh bol rahaa tha, aaj vahi duniya bhi bol rahi he ki pradhanmantri ke rup main manmohan singh ke chalate desh ko bahut badi keemat chukaani pad rahi he
 He said that Manmohan Singh cannot hide his true worth by praising international leaders and good marketing to get a 'certificate' for himself in return
 ’ sonia gandhi ko bhi aade haath lete hue bhaajapa pravaktaa ne kaha ki desh ko kathith kamjor pradhanmantri dene ke liye samprag adhyaksh apni jimmedaari or javabdehi ne batch nahin sakati hai, kyonki ye congress pramukh hi hai jinhone manmohan singh ko raajnneetik majbootee or shakti di he
 Asked whether Singh should step down from the post of Prime Minister, he said, We have been demanding this since long ago
 singh ko ab khud atmavlokan karnaa chahie
 The title is printed above the picture of 79-year-old Manmohan published on the cover page of the Asia issue of Time magazine, less successful than expected, India needs a fresh start
 agle saptaah bazaar main aane vaale is ank main kaha gaya he ki sudhaaron par sakhti se aage badhane ke anicchhuk lagate hai manmohan singh
 Prasad said, "interestingly, it is the same Time magazine that placed Manmohan Singh in 19th place among the 100 most powerful people in the world three years ago
" unhone daawa kiya ki singh kii ‘acchhee marketing’ ke chalate purv main is patrika ne unki prashansa kii thi
 Describing Manmohan Singh's nine-year rule as harmful for the country, he said, during this time the country has not only lost development, employment and revenue, but has also deeply affected the image of India in the world
 ’ bhrashtachar ke liye bhi manmohan shashan ko jimmedaar bataate hue unhone kaha, yah aazaadee ke baad kii sabase bhrasht sarkaar he
 It is very shocking that today India is counted among the most corrupt countries in the world
 bhaajapa pravaktaa ne kaha ki singh ke nau saal ke shashan main bharat asahaay, asurakshit or ashakt bana he
 At the same time, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar alleged that the central government is unable to work
 janata darbar se itar samvaadadaataaon se nitish kumaar ne ‘time’ patrika ke aalekh main manmohan singh ko ummid se kam uplabdhi hasil nahin karne vaale pradhanmantri kii sangya dene ke bare main kaha, yah us patrika ke liye mahatv kaa vishay he, lekin ek baat saaf he ki centre kii sarkaar kaam nahin kar paa rahi he
 Their claim for inclusive growth is hollow
 ve lambey samay tak nirnay nahin le pate hai
 The chief minister did not comment on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, but strongly criticized the central government
 tippaniyan He said that the all-party delegation of Bihar had sought coal linkage for expansion of 500 MW of Barauni thermal power plant, but it has not been decided
 bihar jaise rajya kii upeksha hoti he
 This is not a sign of performance
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki vartmaan centre sarkaar pradarshan nahin kar paa rahi he, jise vah lambey arase se mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Party spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said in reference to a critical article about Singh in America's Time magazine, the country which was speaking, today the same world is also speaking that due to Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister, the country has to pay a huge price

 unhone kaha ki antarrashtriya netaaon kii pranshasaayein karke or badale main unase apane liye ‘pramaan patr’ paane kii acchhee marketing se ‘manmohan singh apana asli mol nahin chipa sakate hai
 Taking a dig at Sonia Gandhi too, the BJP spokesperson said that the UPA chairperson could not escape her responsibility and accountability to give the alleged weak prime minister to the country, as it is the Congress chief who gave political strength and power to Manmohan Singh

 com / nkp6nicyo5— Sachin Tendulkar (@sachin_rt)september 23, 2019master blaster sachin tendulkar ne madhav apte ke nidhan par shok jataayaa he
 He tweeted and shared his memories
 sachin ne likhaa- jab main 14 saal kaa tha, tab mujhe shivaji park main unke khilaaf khilne ko mila
 i still remember when, at the age of 15, he (apte) and Dungarpur sir (raj Singh Dungarpur) let me play for CCI
 unhone hameshaa meraa samarthan kiya or ve mere shubhachintak the
 may his soul rest in peace
 
 
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad bahujan samaaj party (bijepi) kii pramukh mayawati ne party ke dhaanche main bada badlaav kiya he
 Mayawati has once again made her brother Anand Kumar the national vice-president of the party, while nephew Akash Anand has been given the responsibility of national coordinator
 duusari baar he jab mayawati ne anand kumaar ko party main itnaa bada ohada diya he
 a few days ago, Mayawati removed Anand Kumar from the post of party vice-president
 tab kaha gaya tha ki bhai bhatijawad kaa aarope lagane par unhone yah kadam uthaaya tha
 But the question is, if they were so concerned about nepotism, then why were the family members elected to important positions in the party? Actually Mayawati was under pressure due to defeat in 2012, 2014, 2017, and not even the expected success in 2019
 Huh
 in varshon main party ke kadavar netaaon swami prasad maurya, nasimuddin siddiki or brajesh pathak ke chale jane se basapa main aise vishwasaneey logon kii kami ho gai jis par mayawati bharosa karti rahi hai
 These things are also being speculated as to whether Mayawati is feeling weak in the current situation? What is she thinking about bringing Anand Kumar back to BSP? Is Mayawati having trouble handling BSP after her special leaders leave the party? Is this why Mayawati has appointed Anand Kumar as the BSP officer so that she can be his help in rebuilding the party? Whom to do: Is it possible that Mayawati has now lost faith in others? Or Mayawati is beginning to realize that in politics too, she has her own way
 siyaasi galiyare main kaha ja rahaa he ki maujuuda halaat bataate hai ki mayawati anand kumaar ke alaava kisi or par bharosa nahin kar saktin
 The history of the BSP shows that whoever Mayawati considered close in politics, the same person left the party and joined hands with the opposition parties
 inamen swami prasad maurya or nasimuddin siddiki kaa naam sabase upar he
 Swami Prasad Maurya was once called Mayawati's right hand, but she covered the saffron flower
 yahi kahani nasimuddin siddiki ke saath doharaai gai or unhone congress kaa haath tham liya
 Concern for heritage Mayawati, who has passed the age of sixty, is also worried about party heritage
 haalanki mayawati kah chuki hai ki satishchandra mishra kabhi unke uttaradhikari nahin banenge
 He had clearly stated on 14 April 2017 that his successor in the BSP could be a Dalit or a Muslim
 baharhaal, danish ali ko loksabhaa main basapa kaa netaa banaaya gaya he, or anand kumaar ke saath unke bete akaash kumaar ko party main ahm jimmedaari di gai he
 What is to be believed that Mayawati has found a new face in the party that she can trust? chhbbees janvari 1950 ko, jab bharat ne khud ko duniya kaa sabase lanbaa samvidhan arpit kiya, to iske rachayitaaon main desh ke bhavishya ko lekar ek vijan tha
 But surprisingly, neither did he mention two words , "political party" nor the word budget
 bhartiya loktantr kaa khaakaa khinchne ke 60 saal ke baad aaj desh inhen shabdon ke irdagird gum rahaa he
 Politics and policies are in abundance but there is no hope in the atmosphere, no resolution, no discussion on what the parties or candidates aim to do or what they hope to accomplish if elected
 to kya vastav main ham yah kah sakate hai ki hamaare saamne ab koi bada sapana yaa disha nahin he?lekin sach to yah he ki civil socity kaa agenda oonchai par laharaa rahaa he

 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main congress ne apane itihaas kii sabase buree chunavi haar dekhi, uske baad bhi ek ke baad ek rajya vidhansabha chunaavon main 'grand old party' ko haar milti rahi
 But Rahul has continued on the path of politics without being distracted despite so many defeats
 is mishan or ummid ke saath ki congress ko ek naa ek din uskaa khoyaa hua janaadhar waapas milegaa
 During this time, he also constantly faced the political arrows of the opponents
 soshal media par rahul ko ek naam vishesh dekar jitna uphaas udaaya gaya, haal philhal main kisi or netaa ke saath vaisaa hota nahin dikhaa
 Like a warrior who does not bow down, Rahul is constantly engaged in the battle of politics
 is sachai ke baavjood ki 2014 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad kai samikshakon ne unhen raajnneeti se tauba karne kii salaah tak de daali thi
 But it is 2014 not 2017
 kya rahul ke liye bhi sthitiyaan badal rahi hai? ab jahaan unke bhaashanon main dhar mahasoos kii ja rahi he vahiin soshal media par bhi unke chutile katakshon ko pehle kii tulana main kahin acha rispons mil rahaa he
 For the strong mindset and fitness needed to move forward on the fire of politics, martial arts Ekido has helped Rahul to a great extent
 ye or kisi kaa nahin balki unke ekido guru kaa hi kahana he
 His mentor Sensei Paritosh Kar, who skilled Rahul in Ekido, told in a special conversation with 'aaj Tak' how this martial art left a deep impression on Rahul
 ekido main sirf haath se hi nahin balki talwaar or chaaku kaa yuddh kaushal bhi sikhaaya jaataa he
 According to Sensai Paritosh, Rahul told him, 'I have got a lot to learn from Ekido, you are my mentor and i will never leave Ekido
 ’ rahul ke ekido guru kaa ye bhi kahana he ki jis tarah ekido agressive (aakraamak) nahin he, usee tarah rahul bhi aam jivan main agressive nahin hai
 Sensei Paritosh says, “me and Rahul met for the first time in 2009 and since then Rahul has been following along with Ekido
 ham niyamit abhyaas karte hai
 They will not be able to practice much for the next two to three months
 pehle main niyamit taur par unke ghar jaataa tha
 'sensei Paritosh explains that Kirahul practices Ekido with his friends and friends at his' 12 Tughlaq Lane' residence
 kabhi kabhi ise dekhne ke liye unki maa sonia gandhi or bahan priyanka bhi aati hai
 According to Sensai Paritosh, Ekido Master came to India from Japan in 2013 and Rahul gave the test
 us vakt rahul ne test paas kiya tha or unako blike belt mili thi, rahul japan bhi gaye the or vahaan 10 din tak headquarter main is marshall art se jude kai gur siikhe the
 On the whole, Sensei Paritosh is of the opinion about Rahul that he is a very fit man, with an interest in sports, he himself gives an hour to sports every day
 saath hi mental fitness ko badhaane main ekido ne unka acha saath diya he

 Inaugurating the program, Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat said, Sangh workers do their work without any publicity
 haalanki unhen alag-alag madhyamon se publicity milti he, jisaki kabhi aalochana bhi hoti he
 Bhagwat said, i have come to present my point of view on the basis of what i know
 ab aap par nirbhar karata he ki kaise ise dekhte hai
 Whatever the Sangh does, it is special and even beyond comparison because the Sangh has its own unique identity and has become famous among the people
 congress kii bhoomika ko saraahabhagwat ne kaha, sampurna hindu samaaj ko sangathit karne ke liye sangh kii sthapana hui
 The biggest problem is the Hindu here, the decline of our country has started with our downfall
 hindustan hindu raashtra he isaki ghoshnaa headgavar ne kii
 Bhagwat also said that the Congress played a big role in the freedom struggle of the country and gave many great personalities to India
 congress ke sandarbh main unhone kaha ki ek dhara kaa yah maananaa tha ki apane desh main logon main raajnneetik samajhadaari kam he
 Whose power is there, what is its importance, people know less and therefore people should be awakened politically
 bhagwat ne kaha, 'isliye congress ke rup main bada andolan saare desh main khadaa hua
 Many omnipotent legends were born in this stream, whose inspiration still works to inspire our lives
 'unhone kaha ki is dhara kaa swatantraaa prapti main ek bada yogadan rahaa he
 Sarsanghchalak said that after independence, the plans in the country were not reduced, there are allegations in the field of politics, i will not discuss them, but something has happened honestly
 sarasanghachaalak ne kaha ki desh kaa jivan jaise jaise aage badhata he, to raajnneeti to hogi hi or aaj bhi chal rahi he
 The whole country does not have a political stream
 anek dal he, partiyaan hai
 'there is nothing to be afraid of variations' Bhagwat said,' Now what is his position, i will not say anything
 aap dekh hi rahe hai
 Bhagwat said, 'there are so many ideas in our country, but the origin of all these ideas is also one and the point of departure is also one
 vividhtaon se darane kii baat nahin he, vividhtaon ko sweekaar karne or uskaa utsav manaane kii jarurat he
 'he said that the idea of unity in diversity is the basic point and therefore maintain our own diversity and accept the diversity of others
 desh main sangh ke dabadabe kii manshaa nahibhagwat ne kaha, sangh hameshaa tirange kaa sammaan karata he
 Every volunteer is associated with every sign of freedom struggle, but we consider the saffron flag as our Guru
 har saal isi dhvaj ke saamne humlog guru dakshina kaarykram yojit karte hai
 We do not intend to dominate the Sangh in this country
 bhagwat ne yah bhi kaha ki ve logon ko jodna chaahate hai, unpar kuch thopanaa nahin
 
 
 They want to share the thoughts of the Sangh with everyone

 The uniqueness of this program is to be presented by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on all three days to the Sangh's views on various contemporary topics of national importance
 yahaan kareeb 700-750 mehmaanon ke aane kii sambhaavna he
 90 percent of these people are not from the Sangh
 mohan bhagwat shuruaati do din kaarykram ko sambodhit karenge, iske alaava aakhri din vah janata ke sawaalon kaa jawaab denge
 Mohan Bhagwat will answer more than 200 questions during this period
 is kaarykram main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi, digvijay singh or jairam ramesh ko nimantran bheje jane kii bhi khabar thi
 However, the Congress has denied any such invitation to Rahul Gandhi
 vahiin, samaajawaadee party ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ajtak ke kaarykram main hi vahaan jane se inkaar kar chuke hai
 Whereas Congress leader Mallikarjun Khadar has also explicitly called upon Rahul Gandhi not to attend the RSS program

 ) Chhattisgarh's Home Minister Ram Sewak Packra is really strong or not, there is discussion in political circles these days
 darasal police transfar board main grahamantri kii koi puch parakh nahin hone se ve vidhayakon ke liye nammaatr ke grahamantri hokar rah gaye hai
 Due to the absence of transfer of police personnel on the recommendation of mlas, mps and leaders, not only the opposition, but the legislators of the ruling party are also not behind in tightening the powers of the Home Minister
 vipaksh jahaan vidhansabha ke bheetar grahamantri par chutki le rahaa he to sattadhari dal ke vidhayak apane kamaron main
 The reasoning of all is the same, why the power has become the home minister
 chhattisgasaividhansabha main rajya ke grahamantri ram sevak pakara ko lekar congress ne jamkar chutki lee
 Taking a dig at him, Kota MLA and Deputy Leader of Opposition Kawasi Lakhma said that neither the peon nor the DGP listens to the Home Minister
 iske chalate pradesh main bhay kaa vaataavaran nirmit ho gaya he
 Kawasi Lakhma said that neither the merchant nor the common man is safe in the state
 na to ladkiyaan surakshit hai or na hi noujvaan
 There is an atmosphere of fear among the people due to the terror of goon miscreants
 darasal rajya main kanoon vyavastha ko lekar vipaksh sarkaar ko aade haathon lene main juta tha
 At the same time, the Home Minister is also being criticized
 raipur gramin se vidhayak or purv mantri satya narayan sharma ne bhi rajya ke grahamantri ram sevak pakara kii sthiti ko lekar un par tanj ksaa
 He said that Ram Sevak Packra, despite being the Home Minister, cannot transfer a soldier
 vidhansabha main grahamantri kii sthiti ko lekar vipakshi dal in dinon mukhyamantri raman singh or unki sarkaar par taane maarane se peeche nahin he
 Actually, the opposition is trying to target the Chief Minister under the cover of the Home Minister
 darasal vidhayak ho yaa phir sattadhari dal yaa vipaksh ke netaa
 They often knock the door of the Home Minister for transfer of police personnel
 grahamantri unki guhaar sunakar noteshit ke saath sambandhit police karmi kaa naam transfar list main shaamil karaane ke liye police mukhyalay bhej dete hai
 In the hope that the policemen will get relief, it will be transferred, but the result remains the cipher
 beete chaar saalon main grahamantri ram sevak pakara ne police karmiyon ke transfar ko lekar saikadon noteshit likhi
 But barely one or two police personnel were transferred
 wo bhi tab jab peedit police karmi ne aalaa afasaron kii choukhat par apni naak ragadi
 The ministers are generally considered to be the survey servants of their department
 ummid kii jaati he ki unke vibhaag kaa har ek faisla unke nirdesh par hi liya jaataa he, lekin chhattisgarh ke grahamantri ke saath aisa nahin ho rahaa he
 The Home Department has sidelined him with important decisions
 hakeekat main unhen ek sipaahi ke transfar kaa bhi adhikaar nahin he
 On examining the allegations of the opposition in the assembly, it was revealed that the Home Minister of Chhattisgarh has been made power-less by the officers
 aalaa afasar sirf mukhyamantri kii sunate hai
 The Chiefs Secretariat's notesheet runs fast on his table
 jabaki grahamantri kii noteshit sidhe almaari main kaid ho jaati he
 The top officer often writes this tip on the notesheet of the Home Minister, keeping it in his cupboard, citing the placing of the case in the Police Transfer Board
 phir saal dar saal us file main nayi noteshit kaa jamaavada lagate rahata he
 Therefore, now the Opposition is also busy giving the title of 'naam Bade Darshan Chhote' to the Home Minister
 udhar vipakshiyon ke shabd baan ko grahamantri ram sevak pakara sahajata se lekar muskura dete hai
 Even if they do, they know the reality very well
 philhal grahamantri kii kamjor pakad ke chalate police karmiyon ke transfar ke liye rajanetamukhyamantrike darbar main hajri lagaana hi munasib samaj rahe hai

 amit shah ne kaha ki sarkaar ne koun sa niyam todaa he adheer ranjan ye bataaen, sarkaar uskaa jawaab degi

 In the video, the Kalkiak line is seen saying, 'the machine is happy that we are drinking its ink which is making our stomach sink and teaching us nothing to fear
 akhbaar ke opening pej par fere and lavali jaisi aid kii chakachaundh ladakiyon ko khubasurat or aaazaad khyaalon vaali dikhaane se hoti he lekin andar ke pannon kii kahani bilkul vaise bayaan hoti jaise ek taraf to ladakiyon ko syndrella kii kahani sunai jaati he uske haunsalon ko bayaan kiya jaataa he ki vah syndrella jaisi pari he lekin duusari or agar ladki 10 baje ke baad baahar nikle to wo achaanak darty phela ban jaati he

 From fake insurance to fake licenses, the fraud is going on indiscriminately
 driving license keval 200 rupee main mil jaataa he
 There are many such brokers in Delhi and Aligarh, who will make you a driving license at this rate
 police kii naak ke neeche ho rahe is gorakhdhandhe main keval license hi nahin, gadiyon kaa insurance cover bhi farji tareeke se taiyaar karavaaya ja rahaa he
 The broker demanded Rs 300 from us for this, as we were making two licenses, so we started Tollmol and Rs 200 per license was fixed
 do ghante baad ek farji license hamaare haath main tha
 Now we again reached the broker and this time we talked about making fake insurance cover
 vah bhi usne 250 rupee main farji tareeke se banavaakar de diya
 Not only Aligarh, the situation in the capital Delhi is also no different
 yahaan bhi dalal kuch paison ke badale farji tareeke se aapkaa license taiyaar karvaa rahe hai, haalanki thik do din pehle parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ne bhi ye kaha tha ki desh main jari hue license main se 30 fisadi farji hai
 Yogi Adityanath government of Uttar Pradesh has completed one year in power
 beete ek saal main sarkaar kai muddon ko lekar vivaadon main ghiri he
 Of all these controversies, one issue was that of Hindutva, which has raised the concerns of Yogi
 aise kai maamle saamne aae hai jinamein saaf dikhaa he ki hindutv ke naam par kai baar kanoon kii seemaa ko laangha gaya
 1
 saharanpur se bijepi saansad raghav lakhanpal ne beete saal 20 april ko ambedkar jayanti ke naam par shobhaa yatra nikaali
 Which was 6 days after the actual birth anniversary
 unhen shobhaa yatra nikaalane kii ijaajat nahin di gai thi
 But it was later alleged that Lakhanpal's supporters attacked the ssp's house there
 unka makasad esaspi ko sabak sikhaane kaa tha
 After this, the journey took communal color
 is dauraan lakhanpal samarthak or duusare samudaay ke logon ke bich kaaphi jhadap hui thi
 After which Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had to interfere in the case and an FIR was registered against the miscreants
 2
 a week after this incident, an incident came to light in Agra
 isamen aresas, viechpi or bijepi ke kaaryakartaaon par police stesan par hamalaa kar use aag ke hawaale kar dene kaa aarope tha
 In fact, some RSS activists were arrested for attacking a shop belonging to a Muslim man
 jiskaa ye log virodh kar rahe the
 Two cases were registered after the case surfaced, although no further action was taken in it
 3
 In May 2017, there was a ruckus about saffron scarves in the Taj Mahal, which is said to be a sign of love
 42 videshi modells ko tajmahal main entry se pehle unka bhagava dupatta utaravaaya gaya
 VHP and Bajrang Dal supporters demonstrated outside the Taj Mahal
 haalanki, baad main sarkaar ko is maamle main safai deni padi thi
 Union Minister Mahesh Sharma had said that there is no restriction on any kind of clothes
 4
 Apart from this, there were many cases in the state in which activists of VHP, Bajrang Dal, BJP Yuva Morcha, Hindu Yuva Vahini attacked the police station
 fatehpur sikri, mathura main aise kai maamle dekhne ko mili the
 5
 pashchimi uttar pradesh ke meerut main ek maamle ne sabhi ko chaunkaa diya tha
 When a Muslim boy was leaving his fiancée at home, he was attacked by Hindu Yuva Vahini men
 meerut main hi hindu yuva vahini ke logon ne ek muslim yuvak or hindu ladki ko ghar se jabardastee nikaalkar peeta
 It was being described as a case of love jihad
 6
 In February this year, in Firozabad, BJP leader Nanak Chand Aggarwal's supporters were accused of misbehaving with the police officer
 aarope tha ki police vaala ek muslim yuvak ko bachaa rahaa tha, lekin bijepi samarthakon ne uski pitayee kar di
 Nanak Chand Aggarwal is the brother of BJP National General Secretary Anil Jain

 There was a lot of uproar due to the tricolor trip which took place in Kasganj on the occasion of Republic Day
 ye tirangaa yatra ABVP or VHP ke logon ne nikaali thi

 rajdhani dilli main vaahanon par banpar na lagane ke centre sarkaar ke notification ko hai court main chunauti di gai he
 Bumper manufacturers have filed a petition seeking cancellation of this order of the government
 darasal, centre sarkaar ne 7 disambar 2017 ko notification jari kiya tha, jisamen vaahanon par banpar krash guard lagane par karrwai kaa aadesh diya gaya tha
 Bumper companies have challenged this notification of the government
 sunwaayee ke dauraan dilli hai court ne in companiyon se poocha he ki vaahanon mencrash guardaur lohe ke banpar lagane kii jarurat kyon he, jabaki pehle hi dilli jaise shaharon main vaahanon kii speed kya rahani chahie, yah tay kiya gaya he
 The petitioner's plea companies have said in the High Court that the government has taken this decision without any research and safety standards in mind
 lihaaja is faisle ko radd kiya janaa chahie
 Companies argue that crash guards or iron bumpers play an important role in protecting vehicles after an accident
 jabaki sarkaar kaa tark he ki paidal yatriyon kii suraksha ke maddenjar yah khatarnaak he
 The Metal Guard comes under section 52 of the Vehicle Act, which provides for fine
 lekin yachikakarta kaa tark he ki mattl guard lagaate hue vaahanon ke strecchar main koi badlaav nahin kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, it does not come in section 52 but in case of a road accident during high speed, such a car protects the driver of the car and the people sitting in it to a great extent
 bataa den ki sarkaar ke aadesh ke tahat dilli-upi-haryana ke vaahanon ke aage or peeche metal guard lagane par karrwai kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he

 He also hit a six off wide long on off former New Zealand captain and veteran spinner Daniel Vettori
 unhone apana doosraa chakka jacob oram par deep midwicket par maaraa
 However, he was also lucky when trying to play a pull shot on Adam Milne in the air, but Mills and wicketkeeper mccullum, who were running from the boundary, did not catch the catch despite a lot of effort
 is dauraan mills or makkulam ke bich kaaphi tej takkar bhi hui, jiske baad kuch der khel rukaa rahaa or mills ko chotil hokar baahar janaa padaa
 The audience had huge banners and placards in their hands, on which Yuvraj was congratulated for his return
 bhartiya team ne pehle kshetrarakshan kaa faisla kiya or jab yuvaraj ne maidan par kadam rakhaa, to kartal dhwani se unka swaagat kiya gaya
 This left-handed batsman also shook hands and accepted the greetings of the audience
 bharat ne shuru main do wicket chatkaakar newjiland kii haalat khasta kar di thi
 This thrilled the spectators more, but the Chepak Stadium was submerged in the noise when the ball went to Yuvraj for the first time
 vah midwicket par kshetrarakshan kar rahe the or unhone pehle over main hi martin guptil ke shot ko rokane main puraani furti or chapaltaa dikhaai
 Yuvraj, one of India's top fielders, stopped Kane Williamson's shot by diving in the third over and made it clear that he had no problem returning to the old color again
 yuvaraj ke agle over main brandan makkulam ne chakka lagaaya, lekin iske baad unhone isi ballebaaj ke karaare shot ko kaich main tabdeel karne kii puri koshish kii
 The ball went out of his hand
 yuvaraj isse chotil ho gaye or unhen maidan par upachaar lenaa padaa

 tippaniyan Dhoni also praised Yuvraj's effort
 yuvaraj ne apane do over main 14 ran die
 Yuvraj had to leave the field after this, which also disappointed the audience

 yuvaraj ne apane samarthakon ko tanik bhi niraash nahin kiya or gendbaaji, kshetrarakshan tathaa ballebaaji teenon main acha pradarshan kiya
 Yuvraj, however, would be disappointed that he could not win the team despite a good performance in all the three departments of the game and suffered a one-run defeat to New Zealand in a thrilling contest
 yuvaraj ek baar phir puraani lay main lautate hue dikh rahe hai
 He made 34 runs with the help of one four and two sixes in 26 balls and also took a catch
 unhone do over gendbaaji karte hue 14 ran die or apni majboot vaapasi se pratidwandviyon ko cheta diya ki vah ek baar phir unki neend udaane ke liye taiyaar hai
 Yuvraj batted in his old style during this period
 unhone newjiland ke purv captain or diggaj spinner danniel vittori kii gend par wide long on par chakka bhi jadaa
 He hit his second six over Jacob Oram at deep midwicket

 He was fielding at midwicket and showed chronic agility and agility in the first over to stop Martin Guptill's shot
 bharat ke chotii ke kshetrarakshakon main se ek yuvaraj ne tisare over main ken williamsan ke shot ko dive markar roka or saaf kar diya ki unhen phir se puraane rang main lautne main koi dikkat nahin he
 In the next over of Yuvraj, Brandon mccullum hit a six, but after that he tried his best to convert this batsman's tough shot into a catch
 gend unke haath se chhitakkar chali gai
 Yuvraj was injured by this and had to undergo treatment on the field
 darshak ekbargi unki chot se sann rah gaye the, lekin jaise hi vah over kii antim gend karne ke liye aae, to phir se stadium 'yuvi-yuvi' se gunjane laga
 The comments dhoni ne bhi yuvaraj ke is prayaas kii saraahna kii

 Yuvraj is once again seen returning to the old rhythm

 This year, Serena Williams will play her first match in the tournament on September 1 and she will be under pressure to repeat Graf's feat
 serena pichley saal yues open jeet chuki he or is saal ke pehle teen slam bhi jeet chuki hai
 Graff did this feat when she was 19 years old but Serena is 33 years old
 donon kii umr main bhale hi kaafii antar ho, lekin form ke maamle main zyaada antar nahin dikhataa
 In 1988, Graff was at the top of her career and Serena is also in top form
 haalanki graph ne serena ko thakaan se bachane kii chetavanee di he
 Graff recalls that moment, saying, 'I remember i was feeling very tired before the US Open, because everybody expected me to win, because of which i was suffocated and i did not concentrate on the tournament
 Was getting ' graph ne serena ke bare main kaha ki lagata he isi vajah se serena toornament se pehle kam logon se mil rahi hai
 Players like Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert were nearing the end of their careers when Graf won the calendar slam, but Serena faces many challenges here
 serena ke virdohi khilaadi unase kaafii yuva he or unhen kadi chunauti dene kaa madda rakhti hai
 Like Graf, Serena has defeated three different players in the final of the three Grand Slam tournaments played so far
 21 singlas kitaab jeet chuki serena ne 17 saal kii umr main 1999 main america open jeeta tha
 The comments toornament se pehle serena apane upar dabaav ko lekar zyaada pareshaan nahin hai
 Serena said, 'I am ready to withstand the pressure
 main haarun yaa phir jitun yaa barabari par rahun
 It doesn't matter to me
 main toornament ko shuru karne or puraa karne ke liye taiyaar hum or phir agle toornament ke bare main sochoongi
 ' serena ke maujuuda form ko dekhte hue itnaa to tay he ki unki daavedaari kaafii majboot he or aane vaale kuch or samay tak mahila tennis par unka raaj barqaraar rahegaa

 There may be a big difference between the ages of the two, but there is not much difference in the form
 saal 1988 main graph apane kariyar ke top par thi or serena bhi top form main hai
 However, the graph warns Serena to avoid fatigue
 graph ne us pal ko yaad karte hue kaha, 'mujhe yaad he main yues open se pehle kaafii thakaan mahasoos kar rahi thi, kyonki sabhi logon ko mujhase jeet kii ummid thi jisaki vajah se meraa dam ghutane laga tha or main toornament par dhyaan nahin laga paa rahi thi
 'graff said about Serena, which is why Serena seems to be meeting fewer people before the tournament
 jab graph ne calendar slam jeeta tha, tab martina navaratilova or kris ewart jaisi khilaadi apane kariyar ke aakiri padaav par thi, lekin yahaan serena ke saamne kai chunautiyaan hai
 Serena's opponents are quite young and have the ability to challenge her hard
 graph kii tarah serena ne ab tak khele teen grand slam toornament ke final main teen alag-alag khilaadi ko haraaya he
 Serena, who won 21 singles titles, won the US Open in 1999 at the age of 17
 tippaniyan Before the tournament, Serena is not too worried about the pressure on her
 serena ne kaha, 'main dabaav jhelane ke liye taiyaar hum
 i win or i win or i stay on par
 isse mujhe koi fark nahin padataa
 i am ready to start and finish the tournament and then think about the next tournament
 ' Given Serena's current form, it is certain that her claim is strong enough and her reign on women's tennis will continue for some more time to come

 3
 nagaland main 15 saal tak congress kii sarkaar rahi he, lekin aaj apane vajood ke liye sangharsh kar rahi he
 Such Congress has fielded candidates for only 18 seats

 The BJP is carrying on the slogan 'congress mukt Bharat', in such a situation, the North East is considered to be a very important election for both Congress and BJP
 5
 The BJP is spreading its foot in one state after another in the Northeast

 a big announcement has been made by the NDA amid the first phase of voting for the Bihar assembly elections! bjp's star campaigner Shahnawaz Hussain announced on Monday that senior party leader from Gaya, Dr
 NDA, was formed when the NDA government was formed in the state
 prem kumaar ko mukhyamantri banaaya jayega
 Shahnawaz was addressing a party meeting in Gaya
 party meeting ke dauraan unhone kaha, 'main aapse aagrah karata hum ki baari sankhya main vot dekar apane netaa prem kumaar ko jitaayen
 He is the chief ministerial candidate in the state
 endie satta main aati he to vah hi rajya ke mukhyamantri honge
 'it is interesting, because what Shahnawaz has said during the meeting is a matter beyond the party line
 bijepi ne kisi bhi rajya main chunaav nateezon se pehle siem ummidavaar ke naam kii ghoshnaa nahin kii he
 On this policy, she wants to move forward in Bihar as well, but in the meantime, this declaration of Shahnawaz is unofficial enough for the right political disturbance
 party ke chunavi abhiyaan kii bagdor pradhanmantri narendra modi ne sambhaal rakhi he
 It is worth mentioning that earlier in the elections of Jharkhand, Haryana and Maharashtra, BJP had announced the candidate for Chief Minister only after winning
 koun hai dow
 Prem Kumaradaw prem kumaar chah baar bihar gaya sevidhayak chune gaehain
 On social media too, he is being considered as an important candidate for the post of CM by his supporters
 unhen party kii taraf se saamaajik or shaikshanik taur par pichde varg kaa cheharaa mana jaataa rahaa he
 Kumar's supporters say that only his leaders can take the developmentalism of PM Modi, but according to reports, Kumar will have to compete with some other big names for this post, including former Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi
 
 bollywood superstar shahrukh khan kii film 'jab harry met sejal' box offis par kuch shandaar pradarshan nahin kar pai he
 The film's collection has reduced in the first two days, while there is no good response from the critics and the fans as well
 is dauraan ek twit he jo ki lagaataar viral ho rahaa he
 Tagging 'vishal Suryavanshi', tagged External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, tweeted that ma'am, when I'm watching Harry Met Sejal in Pune, please let me rescue from here
 vishaal kaa yah twit soshal media par lagaataar viral ho rahaa he or lagbhag 1000 baar retweet kiya ja chukaa he
 Significantly, Sushma Swaraj helps people through tweet, perhaps the viewer got so upset with the film that she made this appeal directly
 @sushmaswarajmam, I'm watching # jabharrymetsejalat Xion cinema Hinjewadi, Pune
 Please rescue me as soon as possible
 
 😭😭— Vishal Surywanshi (@ vsurywanshi87) August 5, 2017 Let us know that the film 'jab Harry Met Sejal' started off poorly on the first day
 shuukravaar ko film ne sirf 15
 Collected 25 crores rupees
 yah shahrukh khan kii pichley paanch saal main ai filmon kaa sabase kam opening de collection hai
 His 2012 film Jab Tak Hai Jaan, released on day 15
 23 karod rupye kaa collection kiya tha
 At the same time, on the second day i
e
 Saturday, a collection of only Rs 15 crore has been made
 gauratlab he ki jab harry met sejal kaa bajet 80 karod rupye he
 In this context, it seems difficult that hardly these films were successful in extracting their cost
 is hafte akshay kumaar or bhoomi pednekar kii film toilet ek prem katha bhi relies hone ja rahi he aise menshahrukh ke paas apni film ke collectionke liye kuch hi din bache hai
 Given the hype that has been created in the cinematographers about Akshay's upcoming film, it would not be wrong to say that Akshay's film, Shah Rukh's film, should fall flat from the box office
 jab harry met sejal film ekatourist guideke ird-gird gumti he
 Anushka goes to Europe and loses her engagement ring there
 iske baad shahrukh or ve milakar ise khojate hai
 According to film critics, when Harry Met Sejal begins to look cumbersome
 gaanon kii adhik bharmaar or story main nayaapan na hone ke kaaran ise adhiktar samikshakon ne nakaar diya he
 There is nothing new in Anushka Sharma's character other than just her Gujarati accent

 Yemen's Houthi rebels carried out a drone attack on Saudi Arabia's crude oil refinery on Saturday morning
 isse duniyabar main kachche tel kii supplai par asar padegaa or iske asar se bharat kii achoota nahin rahegaa
 Saudi oil company Aramco said it would reduce production for the next two days so that damaged oil wells could be repaired
 is hamale ke baad iran or america ek-duusare par ungali uthaa rahe hai
 On the basis of the initial estimate, the energy minister of Saudi Arabia said that the attack has reduced oil production by 5
7 million barrels per day
 ethane or natural gas kii supplai bhi aadhi prabhavit hui he
 The target of these attacks was not only in Saudi Arabia but also on the world's oil supply and security
 ab sawaal ye he ki saudi arab main tel utpaadan par asar bharat ko kitna prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Let us tell you that India is the third largest consumer of crude oil in the world
 bharat apni zarurat kaa 80% kaccha tel aayaat karata he
 Saudi Arabia is India's second largest supplier of crude oil, LPG
 antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii badhat kaa asar bharat ke aayaat bill par agar ek dollar prati bairal badha to bharat kaa bill salanaa 10,700 karod rupee bad jayega
 US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Iran's hand behind the attack in a tweet
 unhone kaha ki saudi arab par qareeb sau hamalon ke peeche iran kaa haath he
 Iran has now attacked the world's oil supply
 is baat ke saboot nahin he ki hamalaa yaman kii ore se hua he
 Meanwhile, Iran has denied these accusations from the US
 usne in aaropon bebuniyaad or arthhin bataaya he
 Meanwhile, everyone's eyes are on oil prices
 kuch jaankaar to kah rahe hai ki antarrashtriya bazaar main tel kii keematen 10 dollar prati bairal tak bad sakati hai
 If this happens, it will prove to be a major burden on India's oil imports

 Significantly, after Karan Oberoi was arrested, his friends from Bollywood came to the fore and said that Karan and the woman were in a relationship with each other

 The news of the arrest of Abu Bakr al-baghdadi, the mastermind of ISIS, the world's most feared terrorist organization
 europea suraksha or soochna vibhaag ke mahasachiv karyaalay se nikali soochna kii maane to aatank ke is sargana ko jinda pakad liya gaya he
 a few days ago Baghdadi gave a speech which was considered his farewell speech
 usamen usne arab ke baahar se aae iesas ke ladaakon ko aadesh diya he ki ve apane vatan laut jaaen yaa khud ko bam se uda len
 Baghdadi is a living effigy of terror and horror in the world
 iske ishaare par pichley dhai saalon se anginat log maut ke ghat utaare ja chuke hai, lekin maut, maut main bhi fark hota he
 The death that Baghdadi gives to its enemies is beyond human thought
 iraq or syria kii retili zamin se hote hue maut itane khaufnak tareeke duniya tak pahunche, jitne na kabhi dekhe gaye or na kabhi soche gaye
 Let's know about 10 ways of death by Baghdadi and its terrorists
 bagdadi ke 10 chehre yani maut ke 10 tareekabagdadi kaa cheharaa number-1-sir kalam19 june, 2016, raka, syria, iesas ke julmo-sitam ke itihaas main ye shaayad ab tak kaa sabase kaala din tha, kyonki is roj iesas ne mahaz chaar saal kii ek bacchee kaa sir kalam kar diya
 Although there is no hope for isis's suffering, but what could have been the reason behind the beheading of such a small girl? So the answer is, his mother should swear in the name of Allah
 phool si bacchee wo is manahuus tarikh ko apni maa ke saath ghar se baahar nikal ai thi
 His mother wanted to send him home, but was not ready
 wo jid karne lagi
 Then the mother angrily swore by Allah that if she did not go home, she would cut off her head
 bas, itani si baat aatankwaadiyon ke kaanon main pad gai
 Then the terrorists asked the mother to cut the head of the child, but when she did not agree to it, the terrorists themselves cut the head of the girl and shaken her mother's hands with her blood
 darasal iesas apni shuruyaat se hi dushmano kaa sir kalam karata rahaa he
 Or rather it is his favorite way to kill enemies
 iesas ne 25 july 2014 ko jab pehali baar ek saath 75 syrian phogiyon kaa sir kalam kiya tha, to duniya chaunk gai thi
 After this, he beheaded exactly how many people, no one has the exact account of it
 alabatta british or america bandhakon ko camere ke saamne iesas ke jallaadon kaa shikaar banate duniya ne kai baar dekha or ye silsilaa ab bhi jari he
 Baghdadi's face number-2-shot in the head showed ISIS to the world how horrible it can be to make someone sit on the ground on their knees and shoot them in their head
 darindagi kii sari hadon se aage nikal kar is aatankwaadi sanghathan ne namaaloom kitnon ko aise hi sir main goli maar kar maut ke ghat utaar diya or apane dushmano ke saath uskaa ye suluk ab bhi chal rahaa he
 But in some of its propaganda videos, ISIS has crossed all limits
 iesas ke aatankwaadi ab tak khud apane shikaar logon goli maaraa karte the, lekin ab usne ye kaam maasoom bacchon se bhi karana shuru kar diya
 Yes, ISIS started shooting its enemies by shooting innocent children in the name of Cubs of Khalifet, the cubs of Khilafat
 vaise to iesas ke kaanoon kii qitabon main har gunaah ke liye apni alag sazaa he
 But usually those caught in espionage crime give such death
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number-3-upar se phenk kar maarnafrj kiijie kisi shaks ke haath paanv bediyon main jakade hai
 He is surrounded by shadows of bayonets, and even if he runs away, he cannot even breathe on his own
 use usee haalat main kisi imaarat kii sabase upree manzil par le jaaya jaataa he
 Then, after telling the story of his crimes by profiteering among the people standing under the building, he is pushed straight down from above
 ye ek aisa manzar he, jiske bare main soch kar hi rongte khadey ho jate hai
 But being gay under the rule of ISIS is a crime for which this is the only death
 bagdadi kaa cheharaa number-4-sangsar kar maaranasangsar karnaa yani pattharon se kuchal kar jaan lenaa
 Can some humans crush the lives of people like themselves with stones? It is difficult for you to think, even today, in many hardline Muslim countries, doing so is within the scope of law
 phir iesas to nafrat or kattarpan kii sari hadon se aage he
 Therefore, ISIS has also often taken lives in such a painful manner
 vaise sangsar kaa shikaar aksar waisi mahilaayein zyaada hoti hai, jin par kisi se najayas rishton kaa ilzaam lagata he
 Baghdadi's face number-5 - Burning in the fire The death of these Turkish soldiers imprisoned in Panjrera revived the dwindling terror of Baghdadi
 syria main turki ke dakhal se baukhalaaye bagdadi ne in sainikon ko maut dene se pehle pinjre main band kiya
 Kneeling like animals and then wrote such a speech of hagiography, which probably will not be forgotten so easily
 barood se bhari in pattiyon ko zanjiron ke zarie in tak pahunchaaya gaya or phir inhen usase jakad diya gaya
 There is no scope of escape in these chains of iron
 maut se pehle khauf ke har ek lamhe ko bagdadi ke gurgey camere par record kar rahe hai
 Due to fear, his throat has become so dry
 petrol main pehle hi nahalaae ja chuke in turki sainikon ko ek ishaara milte maut kii aag main jhonk diya gaya
 The black veneer Yamraj took out the remote of death
 ye remote darasal us barood kaa trigar he jo is lohe kii chen se guzarati hui inke jismon ko chhu rahi he
 The trigger was pressed and the gunpowder caught fire
 lamhaa lamhaa maut tezi se badhane lagi
 Life burnt to death in these flames

 After a gesture, the mortar went off and went straight into the car
 ek dhamaake ke saath car main baithe logon ke parakhche ud gaye
 Pictures of hanging Baghdadi's face on number 10-crucifix on Maranasuli came much from the kingdom of terror
 lekin america jasuson ko is saal bagdadi ke aatankiyon ne jis tarah maaraa use haivaaniyat ko bhi lafzon main bayaan kar paanaa mushkil he

 They were then hung upside down

 abhi isapar hi charchaa chal rahi he ki praudyogiki kaa hastantaran kaise ho or prashikshan kaise diya jaae
 Kawasaki officials say it does not seem right to suddenly jump into the high-speed transportation sector
 kawasaki haivi industries ke rolling stock company ke ek adhikari ne kaha, ‘‘hamen yatri trainon or metro se shuruyaat kerani chahie
 After that we work on high speed railway
 hamen samay kii jarurat he
 Can not do it immediately
 hamen logon ko prashikshit karnaa hoga, unhen uchit dishanirdesh dena hoga
 We have just signed the contract and are discussing how to do it
 ’’ iechare adhikari bhi is pariyojna main bharat sarkaar ke keval teen binduon par dhyaan kendrit karne se chintit hai—samay kii pabandi, mek in india or praudyogiki hastantaran
 He says that the most important aspect of high speed rail is not its construction but accident prevention
 1964 se chal rahaa shinkansen network kaa ek gauravshaalee suraksha record he—53 saal main ek bhi durghatana nahin hui
 At that time, Japan had taken a deliberate decision to boost its domestic economy by developing high-speed rail corridors instead of expressway networks
 japani akaaran hi nahin suraksha or vishwasaneeyata ke prati apni vyavastha par garv karte hai
 He was equally focused on hardware and software which included operation, maintenance, employee training besides developing security, solid management and technological innovation based mindset
 iechare ke ek adhikari kehete hai, ‘‘in sabhi pahaluon ko vyavhaar main laane ke baad hi hamane aage kii raah tay kii
 We call it the 'total System Approach'
 agar inamen se ek bhi paimaane par chook jate to bagaiyr haadase ke 53 saal ke sanchaalan kaa adbhut record nahin bana sakate the
 "they say," first build high speed rail, and then think of 'make in India'
 aisa lagata he ki bharat kaa sara jor ‘mek in india’ ko lekar he
 It is difficult to balance 'punctuality' and 'make in India'
 yah ek aisa masalaa he jise suljhaana jaruri he
 High Speed rail Corporation (HSRC) has been set up to streamline the development and implementation of this project in India
 iske prabandh nideshak achal khare tatkaal nirnay lene or samaybaddh kaam karne ke liye jane jate hai
 However, land acquisition delays and objections from state development authorities are a major challenge
 philhal, nirmaan kaa kaam 2018 main shuru hone or 2023 se iske chaalu hone kii ummid he
 About 80 per cent of the total cost of the project i
e
 Rs 1 lakh crore
 (1
 8 trillion yen) 0
 1 pratishat byaaj par japan kii antarrashtriya sahyog agency se mil rahaa he jise 50 varsh main chuktaa karnaa he
 This is not pure charity
 japan kii companiyon ko lambii avadhi ke is rin kaa laabh to milegaa hi, pariyojna kaa lambey samay tak chalanaa bhi unke liye phaayde kaa sauda hoga
 Tomoyuki Nakano, director of International Engineering Affairs (railway Bureau) in Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, says: "japan companies hope that this will increase sales
" puri pranali ko chaalu karne main kai darjan companiyon ko shaamil karnaa hoga
 a task force has also been formed for private sector participation in this project
 isamen japan ke videsh vyapaar sanghathan, vitt mantralay, vyapaar or udyog mantralay, bhartiya rail mantralay or audyogic niti evam sanvardhan vibhaag ke pratinidhiyon ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 Subgroups have also been established to deal with procurement issues related to rolling stock and railway tracks and to facilitate various aspects related to civil engineering in the project
 lekin ab bhi kaaphi kuch kiya janaa he
 The most difficult issue for such a big project is the acquisition of land
 jab japan ne apane yahaan haai speed rail network kaa kaam shuru kiya to usne ise aakraamak nijeekaran kaarykram ke madhyam se kiya
 He first privatized the railway in 1987 and then divided it into eleven small regional rail companies
 is faisle ko lene main bhalaa ke rajnatik saahas kii jarurat thi kyonki isse tab badi sankchaya main naukariyaan khatm ho gai thim
 The Japanese see the development of the Shinkansen network as a major policy change decision-maker
 iechare ke adhyaksh shukuri kehete hai, ‘‘isane logon kaa jivan badal daalaa
 Earlier, the fastest train also took six and a half hours to cover the two biggest cities of Japan, Tokyo and Osaka
 agar janaa-aana ho to do din lag jate the
 The Shinkansen network made it possible to move in a single day and, of course, it had considerable economic benefits
 ’’rail network upnagaron ke vikaas main vardaan sabit hua, kyonki isane mahanagaron par pravasi aabaadi kaa boj kam karne or railmarg par vyapaar ke mahatvapurn centre banane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai he
 It also created a new class of passengers who opted for railroads as an alternative to road or air routes, reducing the pressure on both networks
 iske atirikt, lagbhag 320 kimi prati ghante kii adhiktam gati ke saath haai speed rail network ne kasbon or shaharon ko ek-duusare ke najadik laane main bhi madad kii he
 Today the 600 km journey can be completed in less than two hours
 haalanki, yah bhi dekha gaya he, sthaneey hiton ke saamne aksar rashtriya hit gaun ho jate hai
 The state's International Finance Service Center (IFSC) is considered the primary as compared to the high speed rail route in Maharashtra
 sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki bandra-kurlaa complex (bikasi) main haai speed rail network ke bajaae iefessi ko sthapit karnaa zyada jaruri he

 is gatirodh se nipatane ke liye gathit teen sadasyeey samiti ke ek sadsy maharashtra ke parivahan mantri varisht shivasena netaa divakar raaote (twajam) ne 10 agast ko kaha ki rajya sarkaar ne railway ko stesan ke liye kuch kimi dur dharavi main ek vaikalpik bhukhand kii peshkash kii thi
 They say that Shiv Sena believes that Maharashtra will not benefit much from the high-speed rail network
 unhone yah bhi mudda uthaaya ki pariyojna ke liye dhan kahaan se aayega kyonki centre kaa laagat saajha karne kaa prastaav upyogi nahin
 Under this proposal, the Central Government will bear 50 percent of the cost and Maharashtra and Gujarat governments will have to bear half of the remaining amount
 ravat kaa kahana he ki maharashtra ke liye yah sahi nahin kyonki is maarg ke 12 steshnon main se keval teen hi maharashtra main sthit he
 He said, "gujarat should pay more amount because it has 9 stations
 ’’ maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadavis ke karyaalay ke ek varisht adhikari kaa daawa he ki jameen dene se inkaar ke peeche saudebaaji kii ranneeti chhipi he
 He says the government wants the same funding from the JICA for the mumbai-nagpur bullet train project as it did on the mumbai-ahmedabad rail link
 nae rail mantri piyush goyal ko jameen hastantaran ke sambandh main fadanvis ko sahamat karne ke liye puraa jor lagaana hoga
 Here, the political game between the ruling powers continues without deciding the future of India and the endurance of Japan is ending
 agar bharat ke rajaneta vastav main desh kaa vikaas dekhnaa chaahate hai, to unhen kigen ke japani vyapaar darshan se seekhney kii sakchat jarurat he jo kaary ke sabhi pahaluon ko sudhaarney ke liye sthir or lagaataar prayaas par jor detaa he
 The partnership is in the benefit of both countries and there are possibilities of cooperation in areas such as defense
 aaj jabaki sabaki nigahen uttar korea or uske parmaanu prakshepastra missile kaarykram ke khatre kii ore hai, isamen andeh nahin ki japan ke liye apane doston kii sankhya ko jitna sambhav ho, badhanaa jaruri ho gaya he
 If nothing else, the recently deployed dark green missile in the garden of Japan's Ministry of Defense is like a stern warning that technological progress is like a double-edged sword

 The stars america main print media ke kshetra main naukariyon kaa sankat he
 In view of this crisis, Facebook has decided to hire professional journalists
 media reports ke mutabik fasebuk bhi khabaren parosane kaa tarika badalane kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 Now Facebook will take the help of professional journalists instead of using algorithms to deliver news
 isi ko dekhte hue fasebuk ne badi sankhya main patrakaron kii niyukti kaa faisla liya he
 While Facebook's decision has been appreciated by many experts, many are also saying that it is not much likely to revive the crisis-ridden media industry
 fasebuk ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki vah rashtriya str ke bade samaacharon ke chunaav ke liye patrakaron kii ek choti team banayega
 This team will ensure that the news coming on Facebook's platform is completely factual and correct

 Facebook journalists will choose news from news sites and will not change their headlines or content
 fasebuk ne janvari main ghoshnaa kii thi ki vah patrakarita main sahyog ke liye visheshkar sthaneey samachar sanghathanon main teen saal main 3000 lakh america dollar kaa nivesh karegi
 Print media is facing a crisis amidst the growing influence of social media in the US and social media platforms are being replaced by newspapers

 According to a survey released last year by the Pew Research Center, the number of journalists working in American newspapers has decreased by 47 percent from 2008 to 2018
 delaware vishvavidhyalay main sanchaar kii professor dena yang ne media ko die bayaan main kaha ki saidhantik rup se main ise behad sakaaratmak kadam maanati hum, isse nai aashaa jaagi he
 He said that this decision is not transformative because it does not necessarily change the behavior of those who are used to getting information on their feed
 yang ne ye bhi saaf kiya ki fasebuk media company nahin he isliye fasebuk ke liye kaam karne se pehle main naitik, majboot patrakarita ke liye unki patibaddhta dekhnaa chaahati hum
 After this decision taken by Facebook, new students doing journalism can also help in making a better career
 philhal kitni vaikency nikaali jaaengi or kis tarah patrakaron kaa chayan hoga, fasebuk ne ye clear nahin kiya he

 Ban allowed due to e-rickshaw absentee from the main roads of Dehradun city, permission to walk only in the streets
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while speaking on climate change, recently called for increasing mobility of e-vehicles for environmental protection
 unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki ham bharat main i-vaahanon ke parichaalan ko badhaava de rahe hai
 The government of Uttarakhand, ruled by his party Bharatiya Janata Party, is seen to defy PM Modi's intention

 The reason for this is the government's decree under which e-rickshaw drivers are prohibited from walking on the main roads of the city
 galiyon main chalane kii ijajatai-rickshaw chaalkon ko sirf galiyon main hi chalane kii ijaajat di gai he
 The government has said that it will run only at night, there will be a complete ban on their operation during the day

 On getting the means of livelihood, the happy drivers might not have thought that the government which planned to provide loans for e-rickshaws will one day become the biggest obstacle in their way of operations

 Lalei-rickshaw drivers also lying on the loan installment say that the riders get little at night
 ab unke i rickshaw kii kisht bhi jamaa karne ke laale pad gaye hai
 E-rickshaw drivers said that they are also getting notices from the bank for not being able to deposit the installments on time
 i-rickshaw chaalkon ne kaha ki agar sarkaar ko unhen chalane se bain hi karnaa tha to panjikaran hi nahin karnaa chahie tha
 The e-rickshaw drivers demanded permission to operate, saying that in the event of otherwise, the loan was forgiven and the amount given by them should be returned so that they could do any other business
