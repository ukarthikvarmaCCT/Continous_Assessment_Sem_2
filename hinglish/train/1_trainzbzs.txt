 pradhanmantri narendra modi is vakt raajnneeti ke centre main hai
 Rahul wants to become a leader by taking advantage of the lapse from him or by drawing a bold blueprint of new politics in front of him
 yah to tabhi hoga jab yah rajaneta khud ko eemaandaar raste par le jaayegaa
 not that easy
 iske liye eemaandaar praayshchit kii bhi zarurat hogi
 Will Rahul be able to do this? kya ve hameshaa narendra modi ko hi nishaanaa banaakar aage badhenge yaa khud kii aalochana ke liye bhi taiyaar honge
 He should thank Narendra Modi
 unhen rahul banane kaa mauka jitna congress ne nahin diya usase kahin zyada pradhanmantri modi ne diya he
 The comments raily or sansad main bhaashan to ho gaya, kya ab rahul saamaanya netaa kii tarah aae din press se baat karenge
 By the way, i am not very excited about talking to his press
 vipaksh main rahete hue yah kaam bahut aasaan he
 On the days of opposition many leaders are available every day
 aisa lagata he ki loktantr ke yahi sabase eemaandaar sipaahi hai
 But recent political experiences show that the same politician gets away from the press as soon as he comes to power
 reliyon main media ko gaali detaa he or press se sawaal pehle tay karne lagata he or sawaal puche jane par samarthakon ko bhida detaa he ki poochne vaale ko badnaam kar do
 On this scale you can evaluate any leader
 isliye rahul press se baat karen to acha or baat karte samay patrakaron kii profile dekhne kii galati na karen to or bhi acha
 By the way, i do not have much to ask them, except that whoever stopped speaking on the arm of the kurta stopped speaking! narendra modi thik kehete the ki koi gusse main bol rahaa he
 It is another matter that Narendra Modi himself used to speak in anger
 loksabhaa main rahul gandhi ne thodaa hansaaya or thodaa fansaaya bhi
 For the first time, he was taking on the BJP camps considered to be expert for speech
 unhen chakaane lage
 Well you are not the Prime Minister
 desh ke to hai hi par kya aapke nahin hai
 i said your Prime Minister, then why did you feel bad
 loksabhaa main rahul gandhi saamaanya hokar bol rahe the
 He took off the load of being Rahul on his own
 wo is chintaa se mukt lage ki bolte vakt virdohi khemaa soshal media par koun koun se latife bana rahaa hoga
 In this sense, Pappu of social media has really passed today! ek baat yaad rakhiyegaa
 Speaking is not always influenced by the style of speaking
 raajnneetik halaat bhi aapke bole hue ko takat dete hai
 Apart from this, the politician's own honesty also creates seriousness to speak
 loksabhaa main jab rahul gandhi ne kalavati vaala bhaashan diya tha tab bhi unki tarif hui thi
 People felt that though they speak less, there is a kind of political seriousness
 magar wo gambhirtha jaldi hi gaayab ho gai
 Rahul Gandhi became famous for not speaking
 unhone khud bhi is chhavi ko gadhane main kaaphi madad kii
 When the Lokpal was debated, the youth found Rahul Gandhi
 rahul gandhi loksabhaa main lokapal ko sanvaidhanik darja die jane kaa ek parchaa padhakar gaayab ho gaye
 This time too, it seemed that he is the same Rahul Gandhi who has run away from responsibility
 ab laute hai to unka imtahaan phir se sakht hone vaala he
 These speeches on Sunday and Monday in Rahul's life will become memorable only when he will move forward honestly about his policies
 congress ko ek vaikalpik aarthik niti kii raajnneeti kii taraf le jane kaa jokhim uthaa sakenge
 Otherwise, the general understanding of economic experts is that Congress BJP is one
 bas bijepi faisle lene ke maamle main tej sabit hone kaa daawa karti he
 In Indian politics, two big political opponents can become one in economic matters, what can be a big political accident
 kya rahul main congress ko bijepi se alag kar dene kaa nazariyaa he
 The art or style of speaking can be achieved in ten days, but the approach of moving on a different economic vision comes from deep thinking
 usase bhi kahin zyada gahari eemaandaaree se
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is at the center of politics right now
 unase hone vaali chook kaa laabh uthaakar rahul netaa bananaa chaahate hai yaa unke saamne nai raajnneeti kaa koi saahsee khaakaa khinchakar
 This will only happen when this politician takes himself on an honest path
 itnaa aasaan nahin he
 It will also require honest atonement
 kya rahul aisa kar paaenge
 Will he always go ahead by targeting Narendra Modi or will he also be ready to criticize himself? unhen narendra modi kaa shukriya adaa karnaa chahie
 Prime Minister Modi has given him a chance to become Rahul more than the Congress did not
 tippaniyan The speech in the rally and Parliament was done, will Rahul talk to the press now as usual leader
 vaise unke press se baat karne ko lekar main bahut utsahit nahin rahata hum
 This task is very easy while in opposition
 vipaksh ke dinon main kai netaa har din uplabdh rahete hai
 It seems that these are the most honest soldiers of democracy
 magar haal ke raajnneetik anubhav bataate hai ki satta main aate hi vahi rajaneta press se dur ho jaataa he
 At rallies, the media abuses and presses the questions before the press and confronts the supporters when asked questions to discredit the asker
 is paimaane par aap kisi bhi netaa kaa moolyankan kar sakate hai
 Therefore, if Rahul talks to the press, it is good and if you do not make the mistake of looking at the profile of journalists while talking, it is even better
 vaise mere paas unase poochne ke liye bahut kuch to nahin he, sivaay iske ki bolte hue kurte kii baanhen marodana kiske kehane par band kar diya! Remember one thing

 is bare main mujhe kanoonee raay leni hogi
 He said that senior artists like Lata Mangeshkar are giving the wrong message to the younger generation by making such claims
 shahid ne kaha, ‘mere pita or unke bich yah jhagada 1961 se 1967 ke bich hua tha
 My father had no match at that time, actors like Shammi Kapoor, Dharmendra, Jeetendra, Rajendra Kumar wanted my father to sing for them

 Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said on Saturday that the government is considering bringing more stringent laws and setting up speedy courts to deal with incidents like the 'shameful' gang rape of 16 December to instill confidence in women

 hamen yah sunishchit karnaa chahie ki is tarah kii ghatnaayen phir se nahin ho paaen, sarkaar twarit adaalatein sthapit karne tathaa kade kanoon lagu karne kii disha main kaam kar rahi he
 The government is working to make the laws tougher
 ’police consteble ke rup main apana kariyar shuru karne vaale scindia ne dilli gangrape maamle main ‘twarit’ karrwai karne or abhiyukton ko 24 ghante ke bheetar pakad lene tathaa 18 din main hi aaropapatr daayar karne ke liye dilli police kii saraahna bhi kii
 Noting that more steps need to be taken to ensure the safety of women, he said that Delhi Police has taken several steps after the incident of gang rape of a 23-year-old paramedical student and hoped that they would instill confidence in women
 scindia ne kaha, ‘haalanki, police kaa kaam kanoon vyavastha behaal rakhana he, lekin log har samasya ke liye police ke paas aate hai, isliye hamen police ke kaam ko or adhik paardarshee tathaa samvedansheel banane kii aavashyaktaa he

 " Mehbooba Mufti, the former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir and the head of PDP, took a dig at the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) on Tuesday
 mahabuuba mufti ne likhaa ki agar RSS desh kaa secular sanghathan he, to main england kii maharani hum or is twit ko chand se kar rahi hum
 This tweet of Mufti has become a topic of discussion on social media
 darasal, mahabuuba mufti ne is twit ko ek khabar ko retweet karte hue kiya he
 Which shows the statement of Maharashtra Governor Vidyasagar Rao, in which he is describing the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh as a secular organization
 mangalvaar ko hi maharashtra ke ek santhaan main rajyapal vidyasagar raav ne bayaan diya ki RSS sabase zyada dharmanirpeksh or samaveshi sanghathanon main se ek he, kyonki is sanghathan ne logon ke apane vishwaas kaa paalan karne ke vyaktigat adhikaar kaa sammaan kiya he
 Let me tell you that even before this, many tweets of Mehbooba Mufti have become a topic of discussion, in which they have tightened the BJP or have given their opinion on other issues
 haal hi kashmir daure par gaye pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jab apane bhaashan kii shuruyaat kashmiri bhashaa main kii thi, to us par bhi mahabuuba mufti ne tippanee kii
 Mufti wrote that speaking in Kashmiri language is a good effort, but who wrote this speech
 kyonki isamen kaaphi shabd aise lag rahe hai jaise ki inhen chini bhashaa main likhaa gaya ho
 Great gesture but who transcribed this speech? Sounds like it was written in China with a smattering of words like chus and koshwoli

 co / ulbfmmwm8x — Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti) February 4, 2019 Apart from this, when J&K Governor Satyapal Malik dissolved the assembly in the state, his and Omar Abdullah's communication on Twitter was quite trendy
 aapako bataa den ki jammu-kashmir main pidipi or bijepi saath main sarkaar chalaa rahe the, lekin donon kaa gathbandhan tuutane ke baad sarkaar gir gai
 Mehbooba Mufti has been attacking the Bharatiya Janata Party since then
 haryana main purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda nayaa sameekaran taiyaar kar rahe hai
 He 'maharali' in the new mood in Rohtak last month and formed a 36-member committee with pro-legislators and former ministers to chalk out the electoral strategy
 isse lagata he ki hooda congress kii jarurat ho sakate hai, par unako ab congress kii jarurat nahin he
 Hooda's anti-abhay Chautala is also raising pangs
 hooda kii chunaav samiti ke sadsy or purv mantri aftab ahamed kehete hai, ''ham vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ko rokane ke liye kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai
 On the issue of Article 370, Hooda has supported the central government on the non-party line
 unhone yah bhi kah diya, ''congress kuch bhatak gai he
 "actually, this is also Hooda's helplessness, because despite the pressure, the high command has not handed over the reins of the state to him
 haryana main congress kai guton main banty he, jisamen sabase bada dhada hooda kaa he
 Apart from these, Congress's media incharge Randeep Surjewala, MLA Kiran Choudhary, MLA Captain Ajay Yadav, Kumari Selja etc
 also represent different groups
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav se pehle pradesh adhyaksh banaae gaye ashok tanvar bhi alag dhade se hai
 All the factions opposed to Tanwar are unanimous that the party in Haryana under Tanwar's leadership has gone to the abyss instead of becoming stronger
 pichley chah varshon main aaj tak na to sanghathanaatmak chunaav hue hai or na hi vibhinn chunaavon main party kaa pradarshan acha rahaa he
 The number of mlas supporting Hooda is 13
 unamem se ek vidhayak karan dalal daawa karte hai, ''agar pradesh congress kii bagdor bhupendra singh hooda ko saunp di jaae or unke netritv main vidhansabha chunaav lade jaaen to party behatar pradarshan kar sakati he
 "in the last six years, the Congress high command has changed the state in-charge three times, but they too could not finish factionalism
" maujuuda prabharee gulam nabi aaazaad hai, par vidhansabha chunaav najadik hone ke baad bhi ve pradesh se nadaarad hai
 Hooda feels that under these circumstances the Congress will not be able to compete with the ruling BJP, so he has started preparing non-congress land
 rohtak kii raily main na to unhone sonia gandhi yaa rahul gandhi kaa naam liya or na hi kahin unke poster lagavaaye
 Hooda's new equation may include the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD)
 inelo ke mukhiya oprakash chautaala kehete hai ki unhen congress virdohi kisi bhi samaan vichaar vaale dal ke saath jane main koi aitraaj nahin hai
 Hooda and Chautala have a strong hold over Jat and rural mothers
 inke saath aane se bhaajapa ko pareshaani ho sakati he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has not opened its cards, but it can go with Hooda
 vahiin, bhaajapa se alag hokar party banane vaale purv saansad rajkumaar saini kehete hai, ''ham jat virdohi nahin hai
 "earlier, he has been surrounded by Chautala and Hooda on this issue
 unke badale sur ko bhi hooda kii siyaasi chaal kaa hissaa mana ja rahaa he
 Sarabjot Singh Duggal, a senior journalist from Kurukshetra, says, "hooda has supported Article 370 as part of a special strategy to cut the BJP on the issue in elections
" '' par pradesh bhaajapa adhyaksh subhash baraala kehete hai, ''hooda kii yah chaal hamen nahin roak paaegi
 Meanwhile, on Congress 370, Congressmen from Hooda Keerukh to Mewati Muslim dominated areas are confused
 rajya kii kam-se-kam aath siton par mev muslim votaron kaa sidhaa prabhaav he
 "we do not support Hooda in terms of Article 370," says Maman Khan Engineer, a senior Meo leader of Congress who provided a large number of vehicles from Mewat for Hooda's Rohtak rally

 To provide work to the people in the village, the Mahatma Gandhi National Employment Guarantee Scheme i
e
 MNREGA scheme was started by the government
 lekin rajasthan ke aankadon ko dekhen to ye mahatma gandhi rashtriya gramin berogari guarantee yojana najar aegi
 It is difficult to believe that under the MNREGA, only 13 thousand people got 100 days of employment in the state
 jabaki jab se ye yojana lagu hui he tab se kabhi bhi aisa nahin hua ki dhai lakh se kam logon ko 100 din kaa rojgaar mili
 Till date, the reporter visited the villages and took stock of the situation, the problem was more visible in the figures
 jaipur jile ke nimeda gaanv main 6 maheene baad manaregaa ke tahat 12 lakh kaa kaam maanga tha
 But only seven lakh rupees have come in handy
 gaanv menmanaregaa ke tahat400 berozegaar logon kaa job card bana hua he
 According to a laborer of 200 rupees, it is two months of work to hire 50 laborers a day and then unemployed
 zyaadaatar mahilaayein hi karti hai kaamaye sirf isi panchayat kii haalat nahin he balki aas-paas ke begus or phaagi jaisi panchayaton main yaa to kaam nahin he yaa phir naa ke baraabar he
 Because of this, men in MNREGA have stopped coming to work
 kyonki manaregaa par nirbhar rahane par saal bhar main 10 se 15 hajaar rupee kama pate hai
 By which the house cannot move
 lihaaja mahilaayein hi aati hai
 Working women say that they have to sit at home after every 15 days, so how to get home? These are employment figures like MNREGA - 4 in the year 2015-16
 69 logon ko 100 din kaa rojgaar mila
 4 in the year 2016-17
 27 lakh logon ko 100 din kaa rojgaar mila
 While only 13302 people got 100 days of employment till 31 October 2017
 -duusari taraf sarkaar ne manaregaa kaa 97 fisadi bajet kharch kar diya
 In this case, how will we work now? ye hai manaregaa yojana ke aankde-manaregaa ke tahat nae job card ban hi nahin rahe balki ghat rahe hai
 99 in Rajasthan in 2015-16
 36 lakh manaregaa ke job cardedhari the
 4 in 2016-17
 12 lakh kii kami ke saath 95
 There were 24 job card holders
 -is saal 65000 ghatakar inaki sankhya 94
 59 is left
 ghatata ja rahaa he lebar bajet-2015-16 main lebar bajet 2016
 9 lakh
 -2016-17 main ye 2300 lakh ho gaya
 While this has been reduced to 2000 lakhs in 2017-18
 is saal ek lakh 83 hajaar 836 kaam shuru hue
 Of which a mere 635 (0
 36) hi puure hue hai
 That means 99 percent are incomplete
 pichley varshon ke mukaable 100 din kaa kaam mahaj 13fisadi logonko mila he
 While 97 percent of the budget is over
 janata rojgaar maang rahi he or gramin vikaas evam panchayat raaj mantri ji kah rahe hai ki rojgaar maangane vaale nahin aa rahe hai
 Officials are not making job cards
 On condition of not disclosing their names, officials associated with the MNREGA said that the number of people seeking employment is increasing continuously but we are not making job cards
 isaki vajah he ki kaam hi nahin he
 In this way, under the scheme NREGA, the raw work is done on government land and these have been completed in the last 10-15 years
 gaanvon main zyada sarkari jaminen kachche kaam ke liye nahin hai
 Now change the rules of MNREGA only then something can happen or else this scheme will be closed in this form
 desh aaj ganatantr diwas manaa rahaa he
 There will be a spectacular parade at Rajpath in Delhi, in which our soldiers will show their strength
 aise main pehle ashanka jataai ja rahi thi ki kharaab mausam kaa asar parade par bhi pad saktaa he, lekin raahat kii baat ye he ki dilli or ensiaar main mausam saaf bana hua or barish ke koi asaar nahin dikh rahe hai
 In such a situation, many people who have witnessed this parade will have breathed a sigh of relief
 kyonki isse pehle kai maukey par barish ganatantr diwas ke maukey par khalal daal chuki he
 It was raining late Thursday night in and around Delhi, after which it was feared that the rain might not spoil the fun of the parade, but the weather has remained good in Delhi and its surroundings on the last two days i
e
 Friday and Saturday
 log acchhee dhoop main is shandaar pal kaa majaa le sakenge
 The way Delhiites have been battling air pollution in the last few months, people have also got relief after the rain
 dilli kii hawa kitni saaf ho chuki he is baat kaa andaja aap vaayu gunvattta suchakank(aqi) ke aankadon se jaan sakate hai

 Air quality is in the 'moderate' category
 rajdhani main suraksha ke kade intjamganatantr diwas ke maukey par puri dilli ko chhavnee main tabdeel kar diya gaya he
 Para military force personnel are deployed along with the Delhi Police on a whim
 suraksha aisi he ki parinda bhi par nahin maar saktaa
 More than 20 thousand Delhi Police personnel are stationed on the platform
 desh kii rajdhani main military forces ke saath-saath siaiesaf, siarpief, commando or swat team maujuud he
 Snipers are deployed on tall buildings
 iske saath hi bheed-bhaad vaale bazaaron main chappe-chappe par police or para military force tainaat he
 Special security arrangements have been made at Lajpat Nagar, Jama Masjid, Chandni Chowk, Rajpath, Sarojini Nagar in Delhi
 sisitivi se nazar rakhi ja rahi he or metal detector se hokar hi koi andar bazaar main ja saktaa he
 Security is even stronger in Connaught Place
 yahaan bhi police or para military force ne dilliwaalon ko bharosa diya he ki kuch nahin hoga
 Apart from this, security has also been increased at bus stations, railway stations, metro stations and India Gate

 By Friday evening, there was agreement to save the coalition, but both parties are yet to agree on the seats
 pehle mumbai main bijepi kii kor cameti kii baithak hui
 After the meeting, the BJP gave indications of bowing down
 ishaara saaf tha
 
 
 If the alliance remains, the claim for the post of Chief Minister will also be discussed later
 iske baad shivasena or bijepi ke netaaon ke bich baithak hui
 Om Mathur from BJP and Uddhav Thackeray's son Aditya Thackeray from Shiv Sena
 seat bantwaare ko lekar charchaa to hui, par faisla nahin hua
 If the BJP gave the signal to bow down, then the Shiv Sena also gave a voice to continue the friendship
 baithak ke baad aditya thakare ne kaha ki unki party bhi gathbandhan barkaraar rakhana chaahati he
 In the conversation till date, he said, 'our conversation is already going on
 chunaav najadik aa gaye hai isliye seat par faisla bhi jald lenaa hoga
 It was discussed
 jo saamne aayaa uske bare main uddhav thakare ji ko bataaungaa
 He will take some decisions
 'gathbandhan par aditya thakare ne kaha, 'bal thakare or pramod mahajan ne is gathbandhan kii neenv hindutv or maharashtra ke vikaas ke mudde par rakhi thi
 We want to take this alliance forward
 maharashtra kaa vikaas ho, desh aage bade isliye ham saath bane rahenge
 It is believed that in the meeting, the Shiv Sena hinted a bit backward to get ready for 145 seats instead of 150, but there was also talk of giving 125 seats to BJP instead of 119

 Martha, the victim, often went to Afghanistan in connection with her work and was about to return on Saturday after one such tour, but such an incident happened that everything changed in an instant
 ghar main martha ke lautne kaa intjaar kar rahe pati rajesh tandon ko tab jhatka laga jab martha waapas to ai lekin uske aane kii khushi kisi ko nahin hui balkisbaki ankhen nam thim
 Martha returned from Afghanistan a day before but was not alive, sleeping in death
 martha ke mrit sharir vaala taabut liye hue rajesh ne nam ankhon se kaha, ‘aam taur par jab log gadabadi vaale ilaakon se waapas lautakar aate hai to unke parijan ko khushi hoti he, lekin maine kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki vah is tarah se lautegi
 'four Indians have been killed in the attack
 Let us know that Martha was among the four Indians who died in a Taliban attack on a guest house in Kabul on Wednesday night
 hamale se kuch hi der pehle rajesh ne apni patni se baat kii thi or vah apane asinament se kaaphi khush thi
 Martha worked as director with an NGO 'participatory Research in Asia' and went to attend a workshop in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, at the invitation of the Aga Khan Trust
 behad khush thi lekin sab tabah ho gaya
 
 
 Tandon told, 'he talked to me at eight thirty
 vah bahut khush thi or apane kaam se bahut santusht thi
 i think only a few minutes after that the Taliban attacked the house in which she was present

 What is according to the announcement made in Google Tax Budget, if a person or company pays more than 1 lakh rupees in a financial year to a company which is not a technology company of India, then it is taxed 6% of the gross amount
 yah niyam tab lagu hoga jab company bharat kii sthai nahin hogi
 Generally, this tax applies only to technology companies

 That is, if tax is taken from Google, then the effect can also be on the app downloaded from your smartphone
 reports ke mutabik sarkaar is tex kaa dayera kai charnon main badhaane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 The Economic Times published a report citing sources that said, "it was previously decided that from December of this year, this tax will also apply to apps purchased from Google and Apple

 India is the first country to have such a tax provision
 isse un bijness par prabhaav padataa he jo apane products ke prachaar ke liye google, fasebuk or amejonjaisi online videshi digital companiyonper apana prachaar karti hai
 Its scope can be increased as foreign companies like Google often avoid tax due to not being permanent
 haalanki bharat main paise kamaane ke maamle main wo desh kii companiyon se bhi aage nikal jaati hai
 Therefore, the government provided for such tax
 lekin yahi tex aane vaale samay main yugers ke liye musiibat kaa kaaran bhi ban saktaa he
 Experts believe that because of this, Google tax can also be collected from other companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Apple

 congress kii dilli ikai kii adhyaksh shila dikshit dwaara jila or block paryvekshakon kii niyukti karne ke faisle par party prabharee pisi chaako evam pradesh congress samiti ke teenon kaaryakari adhyakshon ne sawaal khadey kiye hai
 Chacko and executive presidents Aaron Yusuf, Rajesh Lilothia and Devendra Yadav have written to Sheila regarding this
 sutron ke mutabik inhone in patron kii pratiyaan party alaakaman ko bhi bheji hai
 Chacko has alleged that Sheela Dixit has appointed 14 District Congress Committee Supervisors and 280 Block Congress Committee Supervisors without informing her
 teenon kaaryakari adhyakshon ne kaha, ''rahul gandhi ne hamen dilli main jimmedaari dete hue kaha tha ki hamen samuhik rup se dilli ke liye kaam karnaa he
 It is sad that Sheila Dixit did not take any kind of opinion from us in this decision
 dilli congress main yah andruni khinchataan us samay dekhne ko mili he, jab congress main netritv kaa sankat gaharaaya hua he
 It seems that in the Congress, policy and party related decisions are also very upset
 isi tarah 'congress adhyaksh' kii ore se jari ek patr main kaha gaya he ki balasaheb thoraat ko maharashtra congress kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya he
 Prior to Thorat, Ashok Chavan was the President of Maharashtra Congress
 ashok chahvan ne loksabhaa chunaav main party ke kharaab pradarshan kii vajah se apane pad istipha de diya tha
 Thorat has been given this responsibility just before the state assembly elections
 maharashtra congress adhyaksh ke taur par balasaheb thoraat ke naam kii ghoshnaa se pehle congress mahasachiv kasee venugopal ne kaha ki mananeey congress adhyaksh ne maharashtra congress adhyaksh or kaaryakari adhyaksh ke rup main nae logon kii niyukti ko apni sweekruti di he
 But the question is that when Rahul Gandhi has resigned from his post of Congress President, then with the consent of which president, Thorat has been given this responsibility
 kasee venugopal kii is ghoshnaa ke baad rahul gandhi dwaara party adhyaksh kaa pad chode jane ko lekar log or khud party ke kaaryakarta duvidha main padate dikh rahe hai
 Amidst all this, in a special conversation with NDTV, a senior Congress leader said that Rahul Gandhi is still the president of the party
 unhone kaha ki congress varking cameti ne unka istipha abhi tak kabool nahin kiya he
 In such a situation, it is wrong to say that he is not the party president
 unhone kaha ki vaise bhi kisi rajya main kise nayaa adhyaksh bananaa he ki aise sabhi nirnay vah 27 june ko hi le chuke hai

 The BJP has blamed Congress MLA Alpesh Thakore for inciting hatred against migrant laborers of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar after raping a 14-month-old girl in Himmatnagar in Sabarkantha district
 udhar, jab gujarat se kareeb 45,000 pravaasiyon ko bhaagane ke liye majaboor hona padaa, congress thakor ke bachaav main saamne ai or usne pradhanmantri narendra modi par ''uttar pradesh or bihar main vot maangane or inhen donon rajyon ke logon ko (gujarat main) pratadit karne'' kaa aarope lagaaya
 Earlier, following the footsteps of Raj Thackeray's Maharashtra Navnirman Sena in Mumbai, the Gujarat Kshatriya Thakor army led by the Congress MLA launched a campaign in northern Gujarat
 iske natijatan mehsana, sabarkantha, aravalli or ahmedabad ke pravasi mazdooron main bhagdad much gai or ve palaayan karne lage
 In these areas, these migrant laborers are mostly employed in farms and private companies
 mehsana jile ke vadnagar main thakor sena ke 200 kaaryakartaaon kii ek bheed ne ek factory par dhaava bol diya or pravasi mazdooron se saath maar-peet kii
 Gujarat BJP spokesperson Bharat Pandya alleges that the Thakor Sena protests have the support of the Congress and is part of their strategy for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 ve kehete hai ki aisi hi ghatana tab hui thi jab patelon ke achche-khaase hisse ko bhaajapa ke paale se alag karne ke liye congress ne patidaar netaa hardik patel ko lubhaaya or khadaa kiya tha
 Pandya said, "it is clearly a Congress party doing politics of continuous distribution
" lekin isse ham (bhaajapa) hi majboot honge kyonki hamen ekajute hindustan ke haq main khadaa dekha jayega
 "apart from anger over rape, the Thakor Army is also demanding the removal of 'north Indians' from jobs in Gujarat
" idhar jab virodh pradarshan jari the, rajya police ne uttari gujarat main 56 exiar darj kin or hindibhashi bashindon par hamale karne ke liye 400 se zyada logon ko giraftaar kiya

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne jab rajya main hinsa kii bhatrsana kii, to us par mukhyamantri ne tikhi pratikriya kii
 Rupani said, "it is shameful that Rahul Gandhi first incites violence in Gujarat and then condemns it
" agar ve vaaki sanjeeda hai to unhen hinsa bhadakaakar samaaj ko baantne kaa kaam kar rahe apni party ke netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ke khilaaf karrwai kerani chahie
 Meanwhile, the Kshatriya Thakor army also came under the target of civil society groups
 unhone thakor ko majaboor kiya ki ve bayaan jari karen or apane samarthakon se hindibhashiyon ko nishaanaa bananaa band karne ke liye kahen
 Thakor said in his statement, "he is also our brother
 ''isse pehle thakor ne vadnagar main hui hinsa se khud ko alag kar liya tha, par ve 'gujarat gujaratiyon ke liye' kii apni maang par ade rahe
 He said, "I do not support what happened in Vadnagar

 On Wednesday, Rahul Gandhi said that the election for the post of president should be held at the earliest in the party, he is no longer in this position
 itnaa hi nahin, rahul kaa maananaa he ki party kaa nayaa adhyaksh ek maheene pehle hi chunaa janaa chahie tha
 On Wednesday, Rahul Gandhi said that he was not in the mood to withdraw his resignation at any cost
 unhone kaha ki jald se jald is pad ke liye chunaav hone chahie, main is pad par nahin hum
 Let me tell you that after the election results came on May 23, Rahul Gandhi had offered to resign in the meeting of the Congress Working Committee
 rahul kaa maananaa he ki party ko nayaa adhyaksh chunane main kaaphi der ho rahi he
 The party should call a meeting of the working committee at the earliest and decide on it
 saath hi unka kahana he ki is prakriya kaa vah hissaa nahin rahenge
 He said that when the meeting of the working committee will be called, only the members of the committee will decide
 main baithak nahin bulaaunga
 Significantly, there has been a stir in the party ever since Rahul Gandhi talked about resigning from the post of the President of the Congress Party
 unhone is baat ko lekar bhi naaraazgi vyakt kii thi ki haar kii jimmedaari kisi netaa ne nahin lee or naa hi unki peshkash ke baad kisi ne istipha diya
 After which hundreds of leaders in the party had renounced their posts, although no national level leader was involved in this

 Activists are also staging a sit-in, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and senior party leader Ahmed Patel also reached out to meet the activists sitting in Delhi

 isro (indian Space Research Organisation) ke chandrayan-2 (chandrayaan-2) kaa vikram lander hi iklauta yaan nahin he jisase sampark tutaa he
 This has happened before in the history of space science
 european spes agency (ESA) kaa ek yaan jisase sampark tut gaya tha, uske bare main 12 saal baad jaankaree mili thi
 He met but could not be contacted
 yani ummid khone kii jarurat nahin he
 ISRO scientists discovered Vikram Lander only after about 35 hours
 ab prayaas sirf is baat kaa ho rahaa he ki vikram lander se sampark sthapit ho jaae
 Let's know the mysterious story of that vehicle, which was found after 12 years, is an artistic picture of the Beagle-2 vehicle of the European Space Agency
 (photo-esa)hua yun ki european spes agency (ESA) ne mangal grah ke liye 2 june 2003 ko ek lander launch kiya tha
 Its name was Beagle-2
 puure mishan kaa naam tha mars express mishan
 This lander, launched in June, was supposed to reach Mars on December 19, 2003, after 6 months
 yaan pahunchaa bhi lekin usee din isse european spes agency se sampark tut gaya
 Attempts were made to contact Beagle-2 for about two and a half months
 lekin usne prithvi se bheje gaye kisi bhi sandesh kaa jawaab nahin diya
 Finally in February 2004, the mission was declared a failure
 teen alag-alag hisson main dikhaai padaa tha lander, uskaa parachute or rier cover
 (photo-nasa) ESA sent the Beagle-2 mission to Mars to explore the possibility of life through it
 beagal se sampark tuutane ke baad ESA mars expressant mishan ke orbitor se kai baar sampark karne kii koshish kii gai
 But this was not possible
 orbitor se aisi tasviren bhi nahin mili ki yah pataa chal sake ki vahaan kya hua
 Nearly 12 years later, on January 16, 2015, the American Space Agency nasa's NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter was circling its orbit to collect information from Mars, taking pictures of Beagle-2
 is bich, beagal-2 mishan ke kartadharta colin pellinger kii bhi maut ho chuki thi
 Photographs from NASA showed that Beagle-2 was about 5 km away from its fixed landing place
 mangal ke is ilaake ko isidis planesia kehete hai
 nasa's Mangalyaan had taken such a picture of Beagle-2
 nasa kii tasveeron kaa vishleshan karne par pataa chalaa ki beagal-2 kaa zyaadaatar hissaa sahi salaamat he
 He made the landing correctly, but his solar panel broke during landing
 isse puure beagal-2 ko urja nahin mil rahi thi
 Not receiving energy, the antenna installed for communication stopped working
 isliye isse sampark tut gaya
 The communication could not be established again

 madhya pradesh main basmati dhan ugane vaale kisaanon ke ghaav beeti 6 march ko ek baar phir hare ho gaye jab bhopal main dharne par baithe mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne krishi or khaadya utpaada niryaat vikaas praadhikaran (apida) kii bhedbhaavpurn niti ke khilaaf aawaaj buland kii
 Despite all efforts of the state government, APEDA is not ready to include Madhya Pradesh in the list of basmati growing states
 iskaa khamiyaja uthaanaa pad rahaa he kisaanon ko
 Madhya Pradesh has been making efforts to place itself in the category of basmati rice growing states
 beete november main yah prayaas rang laata dikhaa tha
 The Geographical Indication Registrar (GIR), the patenting body for agricultural produce, had then recommended the Central Agriculture Department to include Madhya Pradesh in the list of basmati growing states
 is par desh main basmati ugane vaala kshetra tay karne kii jimmedaari centre sarkaar ne apida ko saunp di
 APEDA included Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir in this list but did not include Madhya Pradesh
 isse pradesh ke un kisaan pariwaron ko gaharaa dhakka pahunchaa he jo peedhishon se is khushboodaar basmati dhan kii kheti karte aa rahe hai
 With the decision of APEDA, the State Government is in a position as Basmati paddy has been cultivated in the state for almost a century
 lekin apida pradesh ke is daawey ko maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 Actually, APEDA has not considered basmati paddy as the only native crop of Madhya Pradesh
 pradesh ke krishi vibhaag ko bheje apane jawaab main apida ne uske daawey ko khaarij karte hue kaha he ki yahaan ke kisaan paramparaagat rup se basmati kii kheti nahin karte hai
 Also, Basmati is the native crop of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Haryana
 apida kaa yahi tark madhya pradesh ko basmati ugane vaale rajya kaa darja milane main aade aa rahaa he
 APEDA also says that if Madhya Pradesh is included in the list as a new entry, it will be unfair to other basmati growing states
 gwalior ke paas jigsauli gaanv ke joginder singh ke khet main lagane vaale basmati dhan kii khushboo dur-dur tak failati he
 But Singh does not get much benefit from it
 ve na to is dhan ko niryaat ke liye bhej sakate hai or na hi unhen iskaa vaazib daam miltaa he
 The specialty of Basmati paddy in the state is that farmers here use chemical fertilizer at least
 yahaan par dhan kii fasal puri tarah se barsaat ke pani par nirbhar he
 Farmers in other states use pesticides, chemical fertilizers and irrigation tools to increase yields
 pradesh ko agar basmati ugane vaale rajya kaa darja miltaa he to yahaan ke kisaan tarakkee kii sidhiruaan chadh sakenge
 Many rice-based industries will also be established in the state, and this will create many types of jobs
 madhya pradesh apane basmati chaaval kaa niryaat tabhi kar saktaa he jab apida use basmati ugane vaala rajya maan le
 Presently, the farmers here are forced to sell their crops to brokers at low prices
 is suchi main shaamil hone par madhya pradesh, uttar pradesh or punjab kii tarah hi basmati chaaval kaa apana khud kaa brands bhi bana saktaa he
 State Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan has opened a front against this decision of APEDA
 bemausam barish se tabah hui pradesh ke kisaanon kii fasal kii khatir centre sarkaar se muaavje kii maang karte hue siem ne bhopal main dharna diya tha
 Here he also accused APEDA of discriminating
 madhya pradesh ne basmati dhan ugane vaale rajya kii suchi main shaamil hone ke liye lambii ladaai ladi he
 Basmati paddy is being cultivated in an area of about three lakh acres in 14 districts including Morena, Bhind, Gwalior, Datia, Shivpuri, Guna, Vidisha
 pradesh ke krishi vibhaag ne jiiar ke saamne kai aitihaasik tathy pesh kar sabit kiya tha ki 1931 ke pehle se basmati dhan yahaan ugaaya ja rahaa he
 The old Gazetteer was also cited for this
 pradesh sarkaar ne yah tark bhi diya tha ki chambal nadi se lekar narmada nadi ke kinare based kshetron kii jalwaayu basmati chaaval kii kheti ke liye ekadam anukool he
 The GIR accepted these arguments of the state government
 lekin apida inhen maanane ko taiyaar nahin he
 That is why he is not considering basmati paddy as the original crop of Madhya Pradesh
 philhal, pradesh ke basmati kisaan apni haalat par taras khaane ke alaava or kuch nahin kar sakate hai
 Badrinarayan of Sigaura village says, "our basmati rice is 40 to 50 rupees
 prati kilo bamushkil bikta he
 While the market price of basmati rice is 100 to 125 these days
 prati kilo he
 Since Madhya Pradesh cannot even export Basmati legally
 yahi vajah he ki pradesh un rajyon ko apana dhan kam daam par bechney par majaboor he, jinhen niryaatak kaa darja mil chukaa he
 Chief Minister Chauhan believes that APEDA is doing injustice to the farmers of the state
 unke shabdon main, ''apida madhya pradesh ko bamasati dhan ugane vaala rajya nahin maan rahaa he
 This is against the interests of the farmers of the state
 uskaa ravaiya pakistan jaisaa he, jo hameshaa se bhartiya basmati dhan kisaanon kaa virodh karata aayaa he
 The attitude of APEDA is also against the national interest
 '' chouhan ne kisaanon se kaha he ki ve is mudde ko ek baar phir se centre sarkaar ke saamne rakhenge or pradesh ke kisaanon ko unka vaazib haq dilaakar rahenge
 At present, the farmers have no other way than to maintain hope
 bijepi ke firebrand netaa narendra modi ko congress par hamalaa karne kaa bas mauka bhar chahie
 During an event in Ahmedabad, Modi on a number of fronts brought the Congress to the forefront of accusations and accusations
 chaahe wo sibiai ke apane phaayde ke liye istemaal kaa masalaa ho, centre sarkaar kaa bharat nirmaan vigyaapan ho yaa phir chhattisgarh main naksali hamale kii ghatana
 Modi lashed out at the Gandhi family and said that the Congress is just for one family
 modi ne purv enesayuai kaaryakartaaon se kaha ki congress party ne unhen dhokhaa diya
 On the wrong use of CBI, Modi warned the government and said that no one trusts the government
 modi ne congress ke 'bharat nirmaan' par bhi ungali uthaai or kaha ki bharat nirmaan par 'shaq' he meraa
 The opportunity was for thousands of Congress workers to join BJP in Ahmedabad
 samaaroh main NSUI or youth congress ke kareeb 6000 kaaryakartaaon ne bijepi kii praathmik sadsyta hasil kii
 Also, 56 officers of the Youth Congress joined the BJP

 vyabhichaar kanoon par aaj faisla aayaa
 The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court ruled on Section-497 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) relating to extramarital relations between men and women
 aaj ke faisle se saaf ho gaya ki court ne samanta ke adhikaar ko sarvopari maanate hue mahilaon ke adhikaar ko sarvopari mana
 a five-member bench of the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that adultery is not a crime
 beete 2 agast ko desh kii sheersh adaalat main is maamle par sunwaayee thi
 The court had then said, 'the adultery law seems to favor women but in reality it is anti-women
 pati ke kehane par patni kisi kii ichha kii purti kar sakati he, to ise bhartiya naitikta katai nahin maan sakate
 'the court further said, in marriage the husband and wife have equal responsibility
 phir akeli patni pati se zyada kyon sahe? yahi kaaran he ki supreme court is kanoon ko puraatan maan rahi he
 It is clear from the hearing in the Supreme Court that the court arguments mainly went around equality and non-equality
 tabhi court ne daleel di ki vyabhichaar par dandatmak praavdhaan samvidhan ke tahat samanta ke adhikaar kaa paroksh rup se ulanghan he kyonki yah vivaahit purush or vivaahit mahilaon se alag-alag bartaav karata he
 Court standing in favor of women? As the Supreme Court has said in the past that adultery is a law-abiding woman but against women
 is tark se saaf he ki faisle kaa aadhaar purush-mahila ke bich samanta ke adhikaar kii ore ishaara karata he
 Whereas in this case, a petition was filed in the Supreme Court some years ago, that it is against the spirit of equality, ie Article 14 of the Constitution
 agar kisi aparaadh ke liye mard ke khilaaf cese darj ho saktaa he, to phir mahila ke khilaaf kyon nahin?is arji ko supreme court ne khaarij kar diya tha
 The court considered the woman to be a weak side and said that in such a case a case cannot be tried against her
 haalanki court kii daleelon se yah spasht nahin ho sakaa ki jab cese mard ke khilaaf darj hoga, to mahila ko kamjor paksh kaise maan sakate hai
 One aspect of this law was also that the perpetrators could be 'men only' and women were only victims because there was a provision to file a case only against the man who had a relationship with the married woman
 us mahila ke khilaaf mukadmaa nahin hota, jisane aise sambandh banane ke liye sahmati di

 com / rngqaesb2v The CBI has filed a second appeal in the Delhi High Court against the Essar Group promoters Ravikant Ruia and Anshuman Ruia in the 2G spectrum case
 pichley saal disambar main patiala house court ne ravikant ruia or anshuman ruia ko 2ji maamle main bari kar diya tha
 The CBI has challenged the decision of the Patiala House Court in the High Court
 court is par 20 april ko sunwaayee karegaa
 Earlier, CBI and ED had appointed former Telecom Minister A
K
 raja or kanimojhi samet nichali adaalat se bari hue sabhi 19 logon ke khilaaf hai court main apil kii thi jis par sabhi ko court ne notice jari kar jawaab maanga he
 Both ED and CBI have filed their appeals in the Delhi High Court
 ye duusari apil he jo sibiai kii taraf se 2ji cese main lagaai gai he
 Earlier on December 21, Delhi's special CBI Patiala court acquitted all the accused from the 2G case on all charges
 us vakt court ne apane aadesh main kaha ki jaanch agency aropiyon ke khilaaf koi bhi pukhta saboot court main pesh nahin kar pai, jiske chalate court ke paas un sabhi ko bari karne ke alaava koi chaara nahin tha
 The 2G case in the court was in 2010 and based on the CAG report, it was believed that it was a scam of about 175 thousand crores

 Jammu and Kashmir cricketer Parvez Rasool, who came under attack from critics for chewing chewing gum before the match against England, has for the first time broken the silence on the entire controversy
 parvej ne ek intervyuu main is baat par dukh jataayaa ki aise vivaad kashmiriyon ke saath hi jode jate hai jo pehle hi tamaam mushkilon se jujhate hue kisi tarah apana mukaam banaate hai
 Parvez Rasool said that we come from a state in which there is no agreement
 ek cricketer ko cricket khilne do, bajaay ki use raajnneeti main ghusaao
 My goal is that i play cricket, pay attention to it, if someone else says something, then i don't pay much attention to it
 parvej rasul ne kaha ki ye bahut durbhagyapurna hai ki ye chijen hamaare saath hoti hai, ek player he jo puri mehnat karata he ki top level par khele lekin uske saath aisi chijen lagaani or uskaa dimag duusari ore ghumana, ye bahut buree cheez he
 And this happens to everyone
 hamaare iees topper hai unke saath bhi hua

 aisa nahin hona chahie
 Will critics respond when they get the next chance? On this question, Rasool said that the correct answer to every criticism is that to perform

 Also, they have collected information about fund transfers

 The government and the Congress have left no stone unturned to save Chidambaram after he raised a finger on Chidambaram in the Finance Ministry's note but the question here arises as to which case
 raja, kanimojhi ko jail kii salaakhon ke peeche pahunchaa diya, usee maamle main kya pi chidambaram ke khilaaf karrwai hogi?centre kii sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) sarkaar ke do mantriyon kii bali le chuke 2ji spectrum aavanton maamle main ab apni bhoomika ko lekar uth rahe sawaalon par kendriya grih mantri pi
 Chidambaram is seen to be surrounded
 aise main jahiraa taur par vipakshi dalon ne unke istife kii maang tej kar di to congress se lekar sarkaar tak khulkar unke bachaav main khadi ho gai
 Meanwhile, in a conversation with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, Chidambaram refused to react to anything until he returned home
 ullekhneey he ki kendriya vitt mantralay ne march main pradhanmantri karyaalay ko ek note bheja tha, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki tatkaaleen vitt mantri pi
 If Chidambaram wanted, 2G spectrum could be auctioned for telecom operators in 2008
 nilaamee par jor dekar chidambaram spectrum ko puraani keemat par bechney se roak sakate the, jisase hajaaron karod rupee ke nuksaan se bachaa ja saktaa tha
 This note was prepared by the Deputy Secretary in the Union Finance Ministry and sent to the Prime Minister's Office on 25 March
 ek saamaajik kaaryakarta vivek garg ne pradhanmantri karyaalay main aavedan dekar is patr kii prati hasil kii he
 The Prime Minister and the Union Finance Minister have spoken to him over the phone when Chidambaram's name appears in this revelation
 chidambaram ne pradhanmantri or mukherjee ko bharosa diya he ki unke swadesh lautne tak vah is maamle main koi pratikriya nahin denge
 It may be known that the Prime Minister and the Union Finance Minister have gone to New York to attend the session of the United Nations General Assembly
 chidambaram ne guuruuvaar ko ek bayaan main kaha, 'media ke logon ne mujhase poocha he ki main chup kyon hum
 The Prime Minister called me from Frankfurt last night and talked to me and the Union Finance Minister discussed the phone with me from Washington
 unhone kaha, 'maine pradhanmantri ko bharosa diya he ki jabatak vah bharat laut nahin aate tabatak main is masale par koi saarvajanik bayaan nahin duungaa
 Meanwhile, government sources said that during a phone conversation, the Prime Minister told Chidambaram that he had not seen the Union Finance Ministry's remarks mentioning his role in the 2G spectrum allocation
 sutron ne bataaya ki donon netaaon ke bich phone par baatcheet kareeb 20 minute tak chali
 During this time, the Prime Minister expressed full confidence in Chidambaram's loyalty and asked him to be patient in this matter till his return home
 pranab mukherjee ne yah kehete hue ki maamla adaalat ke vichaaradhin he, is note ke bare main sidhi tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya
 Mukherjee, however, admitted that such a letter was written by his office
 unhone kaha, 'aaj ek sansanikhej khabar saamne ai he or yah soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat pataa chalaa he
 a letter was sent to the Prime Minister's Office by the Ministry of Finance
 kisi ne soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat us patr kii prati hasil kii he
 'he said,' and it is being used, whether it can be used legally or not is a separate issue - but the truth in this case is that someone presented it as evidence in a particular case is
 maamla nyaayalay ke paas vichaaradhin he or nyaayalay isaki sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) demanded immediate resignation from Chidambaram while the Communist Party of india-marxist (CPI-M) demanded a CBI probe into Chidambaram's role in the case
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa murali manohar joshi ne kaha, 'patr se spasht hota he ki tatkaaleen vitt mantri chidambaram ne is ghotaale ko rokane kii koshish nahin kii
 He ignored the suggestions of the Union Finance Secretary, who had spoken about taking a decision to stop the scam
 'joshi ne kaha ki unki party chidambaram se tatkaal istife kii maang karti he or yadi vah istipha nahin dete to unhen barkhaast kiya janaa chahie
 Senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley said that sending notes indicates that a situation of civil war has been created in the UPA government
 ek kaarykram main jetali ne kaha, 'samprag sarkaar ke bheetar hi yuddh chhid gaya he
 On the one hand, while trust in the mind of the people has decreased, on the other hand there has been a decrease in mutual trust between ministers
 grih yuddh jaisi sthiti ban gai he
 He said that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress President Sonia Gandhi continue in the role of mere mute spectator
 jetali ne is masale par pranab mukherjee par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa
 Jaitley said that even when Mukherjee sent the note to the Prime Minister's Office, the matter was under consideration of the court
 ediemke kii mahasachiv va tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri je
 Jayalalithaa said that Chidambaram's role in the 2G case has become clear
 unhen tatkaal apane pad se istipha de dena chahie nahin to pradhanmantri ko unhen apane mantrimandal se barkhaast kar dena chahie
 The CPI (M) said in a statement seeking Chidambaram's role in the case to be investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
 Allocation could have been canceled
 ' bayaan main kaha gaya, 'in sabhi sabooton ke aadhaar par makapa 2ji spectrum aavanton maamle main sibiai se chidambaram kii bhoomika kii jaanch karaane kii maang karti he
 Meanwhile, the Congress and the government openly defended Chidambaram on the questions being raised
 congress ne kaha ki yah party main daraar paidaa karne kaa shararti prayaas he
 Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said, "the party has no doubt about his integrity
 yah maamla janata party ke adhyaksh subrahmanyam ne sarvocch nyaayalay main uthaaya he, jo ki adaalat main vichaaradhin he
 "the matter is in the court and without waiting for the completion of the court proceedings," said Singhvi
 swami yaa anya dwaara is maamle main ek nirnay dene kii koshish karnaa anuchit or aapattijanak he
 Information and Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni said, "there is no disagreement in the government
" isse vipaksh ko thes pahonchegi, jisane ek aise mudde ko uthaaya he jo mudda hi nahin he
 There is no fight in the government
 'unhone kaha, 'kendriya vitt mantralay dwaara bheja gaya note niyamit prakriya kaa hissaa he
 There is nothing new in this

 There is regular information sought under Right to Information

 The Indian team is trailing 2–1 in the series after winning the first Test
 aise main yadi team india ke khilaadiyon ne apana pradarshan nahin sudhara to nagpur test main use yah shrinkhalaa ganvaani bhi pad sakati he or uske baad aalochanaon kaa jo daur shuru hoga, vah kai khilaadiyon kaa kariyar bhi tabah kar saktaa he
 By winning the fourth Test match in Nagpur starting on Thursday, England will field the dream of defeating India after 1984-85, while the Indian team will try to win this match so that the series touches on par
 1984-85 main david gavar kii aguwai main england ne bharat ko uski hi sarajameen par dhul chataayee thi
 England captain Alastair Cook is currently in superb form and has scored 548 runs in the series so far
 aise main vah gavar ke record kii barabari karne kaa koi mauka nahin ganvaana chahenge
 Apart from Cook, Kevin Pietersen is also wreaking havoc with the bat, while England spinners have taken a good class of Indian batsmen
 monti panesar ne teen maichon main jahaan 16 wicket liye hai vahiin greem swaan ne 17 wicket lekar team india ke ballebaajon ko ab tak baikfoot par dhakel rakhaa he
 Although Pragyan Ojha has taken 19 wickets so far but his performance has not been decisive
 bharat kii ore se cheteshwar pujaara or virendra sahvaag hi ballebaaji main kuch had tak safal rahe hai
 Pujara has scored the highest number of 412 runs for India so far, while Sehwag is in second place with 253 runs in three matches
 bhartiya ballebaajon kaa pradarshan kitna lachar rahaa he uskaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki of spinner ravichandran aswin 214 ran banaakar gautam gambhir ke saath tisare sthaan par hai
 Virat Kohli has been able to score only 85 runs in three matches, while captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni 92 runs
 yuvaraj singh, jahir khan or harbhajan singh ko chauthe test team main jagah nahin di gai he or unki jagah rabindra jadeja, parvinder awana or piyush chawla ko team main shaamil kiya gaya he

 is bich purv captain mohinder amarnath ne yah kahkar unki mushkilen or badha di he ki andruni dabaav ke chalate lagaataar do test shrinkhalaaon main haar ke baavjood dhoni ko captaini se nahin hataaya ja sakaa
 The news coming out from the top regarding the controversy between Dhoni and Gambhir is also not a good sign for Team India
 in khabaron ke mutabik dhoni ne bisisiai se gambheer kii shikaayat kii he ki maidan par unka ravaiya swaarthee hota he
 Master blaster Sachin Tendulkar is already under pressure to retire

 The film 'anarkali of Ara' is yet to release, so there is a lot of buzz about this film starring Swara Bhaskar
 film ke diarector avinas das ne ek intervyuu ke dauraan bataaya ki sonam kapur ne jab is film ko dekha to wo ro padin
 The film 'anarkali of Ara' is a story of women who live and dance in remote and backward areas
 bheed ke bich thumake lagane vaali in mahilaon se chhedchhad kii ghatnaayen aam hai, lekin inamen se chand mahilaayein in jyadatiyon ke khilaaf aawaaj bhi buland karti hai
 Avinas says, 'when Sonam Kapoor saw the film, she roared and started crying
 unhone poocha ki kya yah sab hamaare desh main hota he? kyonki sonam ne kabhi is tarah kaa sach nahin dekha tha or main maanata hum ki is asaliyat se desh kaa ek bada tabaka anjaan he
 'exclusive: Nitibha's relationship with Manveer has not changed; Devi of Rishtibihar and Haryana's Saspana Chaudhary are examples of those women
 inhen mahilaon ke jazbe or aapbeetee ko parde par utaar rahi he 'anaarakali of aara'
 In this, Swara Bhaskar has enlivened the main character with his acting
 faijabad kii tara bano or bihar kii devi kii aapbeetee se prerana lekar darbhanga ke avinaash das ne 'anaarakali of aara' kii patakatha likhi or khud hi iskaa nirdesan karne kaa jimmaa bhi uthaaya
 However, the film is not based on anyone's biopic, but it contains true events
 film ke nirdeshak or lekhak avinaash das ne ieenes ke saath vishesh baatcheet main kaha, 'meri is film ko kaaphi log byopic maan rahe hai, lekin yah byopic nahin balki sachhee ghatnaon par aadhaarit he
 In the small and backward regions of the country, there are still such women who live their livelihood by dancing and singing, but the mistake is made when they are called 'taken for Granted'
 'avinaash kehete hai, 'meri film samaaj ke kuch aise logon par focus karti he, jo is tarah kii ochhi maansikta dikhaate hai
 Where did the inspiration for this film come from? In response, he says, 'I have done a lot of research about Tara Bano of Faizabad
 vah bhi isi tarah naach-gaakar apana guzar-basar karti thi
 People started harassing her, she was molested
 is chhedchhad or durvyavhaar se tang aakar vah dilli ke silampur kii galiyon main kahin gum ho gai
 The examples of Devi Singh of Bihar and Sapna Chaudhary of Haryana are in front of us
 tab maine thaan liya ki main isi vishay par film banaaungaa
 'know, how did Kangana become Julia to Jwala Devi when asked that' Anarkali of Ara 'will grab the attention of the audience amidst the big budget and the glut of big directors' films? On this, Avinash said, 'the theme is such that it is drawing people's attention
 hamaare desh main pehali baar street singer par film bani he
 This is the first film of its kind, which is talking about the livelihood of women who live and dance
 iske paatr jarur kaalpanik hai, lekin ghatnaayen sachhee hai
 Some scenes of "anarkali of Ara" have leaked online
 is puure paridrishy par roshni daalate hue avinaash kehete hai, 'film ke do-teen drishy li hue hai, lekin acha hi he
 We got a chance to be careful with this
 aaj ke daur main to puri film hi li ho jaati he
 'salman-shahrukh does not do this work, so Kangana Avinash is a hit today, very upset with the work of the censor board
 vah apana gussa jaahir karte hue kehete hai,'sensor board bilkul vahiyaat he
 They pressurized us by making such absurd arguments that i cannot tell
 film ke ek samvaad main sundar cond kaa zikr he to hamen logon kii bhavanaaen aahat karne kaa hawala dekar ise hataane ko kaha gaya
 If there is mention of Arjuna stray at one place, then asked to remove Arjuna, so that people's feelings are not hurt
 itnaa batch-bachaake kahin film banati he sahab
 "he says," In many countries there is not only a censor board, but we have a censor board sitting here as a moral watchman who continues to quell bossy by making absurd arguments

 shuruaati maichon main haar ke baad yah team patari se jo utari to vaapasi nahin kar pai
 The performance of batsmen like Chris Gayle and de Villiers in the tournament was disappointing and the bowlers of the team also struggled
 kohli ne toornament main apni team kii ore se sarvaadhik 308 ran banaae
 He scored 308 runs in 10 matches, his highest score being 64 runs
 toornament main viraat ne chaar ardhashatak lagaae
 De Villiers, another star batsman of the team, scored 216 runs in 9 matches and Chris Gayle scored 200 runs in 9 matches, but this effort proved to be insufficient for the team to reach the playoffs

 In Rajasthan, the chapter of the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru will be included in the text book of schools
 is maamle main mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne shiksha mantri vasdev devnani ko saman kar apni naaraazgi jataai
 The chairman of the text book committee also admitted his mistake
 rajasthan main itihaas kikitabonse nehru kaa adhyay hataane ke baad se bavaal ho rahaa he
 The Congress has been continuously protesting on this issue
 mangalvaar ko rajasthan rajya paathyakram samiti ke itihaas sambandhi chaptaron kii cameti ke adhyaksh brajmohan ramdev ne is maamle main bada bayaan diya
 Ramdev said, 'there is no politics in it, chapters of books are written by different authors
 ho saktaa he ki is dauraananehru kaa chapterhataane main koi bhul rahi ho, is bhul ko sudhara ja saktaa he
 Wrong to compare great legends: Brajmohan Ramdev Brajmohan Ramdev said that Nehru's contribution to the independence of the country has been
 aazaadee ke baad ve desh ke pehle pradhanmantri rahe hai
 His contribution to the independence of the country cannot be denied
 kisi karanvash unka chapter chuta he to agle varsh use jod diya jayega
 Regarding not keeping a single picture of Nehru in the book and adding Savarkar's photo, he said that it is wrong to compare great men
 mahapurush to mahapurush hote hai or aisa bhi nahin he ki saavarkar kaa chapter or photo jodne ke liye pandit nehru kaa chapter hataaya ho
 There is no truth in it
 agle saal kitabon main joda jayega nehru kaa chepterramdev ne mana ki aazaadee ke baad rajasthan ke ekikaran main bhi pandit nehru kaa yogadan rahaa he, iskaa ullekh hamane is book main kiya he
 He said that if there has been any mistake of the authors regarding the removal of the chapter, then it will be rectified and next year its chapters will be rectified in the new edition and their chapters will be added
 'godse kaa naam hataane ke peeche koi manshaa nahin'kitaab main nathuram godse dwaara mahatma gandhi kii hatya karne kii baat hataane ke sambandh main ramdev ne kaha, 'yah sarvavidit hai ki mahatma gandhi kii hatya nathuram godse ne kii thi
 It is mentioned in every book of history and other documents
 rajasthan kii kitabon main nathuram godse dwaara mahatma gandhi kii hatya karne kaa yah tathy hataane se yah baat koi chhipane vaali nahi hai
 There is no intension in this and it is not that any other name is written in place of Nathuram Godse
 ' In Bihar, there was a trend of marriage
 jab ladke kaa apharan karke uski shaadi log apni betiyon yaa bhatijiyon se karaate the
 The reason behind this was said to be social and economic
 dahej kii rakam nahin juta paane kii vajah se achche gharaane ke ladke ko jabaran uthaa liya jaataa tha or uski shaadi karai jaati thi saath hi ladke or uske parivaar ko dhamkee bhi di jaati thi agar ladki ko koi takalif hui to iskaa anjaam bahut bura hoga
 With changing times, this practice has almost subsided but not over
 aaj bhi is tarah kii shaadi ke ikkaa-dukka maamle saamne aate hi rahete hai
 The latest case is of Muzaffarpur
 pakadoua byaah kaa taaja maamla mujffapur ke gayaghat thana kshetra kaa he jahaan pachhiyaari tolaa gaanv main guuruuvaar kii raat ek shaadi ho rahi thi
 The marriage was being forced
 maithi gaanv ke sanjay bhushan ke putr abhinay kaa apharan kar shaadi kii ja rahi thi
 The boy side complained to the police
 police ne tatkaal chhapemari kar duulhaa bane ladke ko chhudaaya or dulhan bani ladki or uski bahan ko giraftaar kar liya
 In this way, the girl, who became a bride at the Patchoua wedding, reached the lockup
 haathon main menhadi saji dulhan ke libaas main jab ladki mujffapur ke kachhari main pahunchi to log hairaan rah gaye
 The allegations made by the bridegroom girls are also very serious
 dulhan bani juli ne kaha ki police waalon ne uske saath marpet or chhedchhad kiya he
 Because there was not a single female police in the raids
 mujffapur ke esaspi vivek kumaar ne iske jaanch ke aadesh die hai
 The boy Abhinav is shocked by this incident
 use gayaghat thana kshetra se hishadi kii niyat se agavaakia gaya tha
 The villagers who attacked Anibhav were also attacked by the villagers
 kaaphi mashkkat ke baad abhinav ko reeha karaayaa gaya
 As people gathered to celebrate Onam in Kerala, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) questioned the legend behind the festival with the plea that it be celebrated on the birth of 'vamana' (incarnation of Lord Vishnu) Vala is a festival, not on the return of the Daityaraja Mahabali
 aresas ke mukhpatr 'kesari' ke olym visheshank main ek aalekh ne daawa kiya he ki kisi bhi puranic granth main aisa ullekh nahin he, jo is lokapriy kinvadanti kaa samarthan kare ki vaaman ne mahabali ko chal se patallok bhej diya tha or vah har saal yahaan apni praja se milane aate hai
 Countering this argument, senior CPI (M) leader and state health minister KK Shyalaja said Onam is celebrated by caste, creed and religion and the RSS is trying to bring back the upper caste dominance
 mantri ne aarope lagaaya ki yah is tyohaar kaa apharan karne ke agenda kaa hissaa he
 There is a popular belief in the state that the return of Mahabali is celebrated every year as 'tiru Onam' to meet their subjects in the Malayalam month of Chingam, which is on 14 September this year
 haalanki aresas kii patrika main ke unnikrishnan nambutiri ke aalekh main daleel di gayi he ki olym mulat: vaaman bhagwaan ke janmdin par manaaya jaataa tha, daityaraj kii grihvaapasi kii khushi main nahin
 The article states, "there is no context or interpretation in the mythological texts or poetry in favor of the legend that Mahabali was sent by Vaman to Patalalok and he comes every year to meet his subjects
" tab aise main kerala main aisi juthi kahani kaise prachlit he
 
 
 The article says that Lord Vishnu did not actually punish Mahabalis by sending them to Patalalok, but blessed them
 aalekh kahata he, 'bhagavatam' yaa 'narayanium' jaise aadhyatmik granthon yaa aisi kisi anya pustak main aisa koi sanket nahin he ki bali ko patallok bhej diya gaya

 The minister alleged that this was part of the agenda to hijack the festival
 rajya main lokapriy manyata he ki malayalam maheene chingam main apni praja se milane ke liye mahabali kii grihvaapasi har saal 'thiru olym' ke rup main manaaya jaataa he, jo is saal 14 sitambar ko he
 Although the article by k Unnikrishnan Nambutiri in the RSS magazine argues that Onam was originally celebrated on the birthday of Vamana Bhagwan, not in the joy of Daityaraja's return
 aalekh main kaha gaya he, ''puranic granthon yaa kaavyon main kahin bhi is katha ke paksh main koi prasang yaa vyakhya nahin he ki mahabali ko vaaman ne patallok bhej diya tha or vah apni praja se milane har saal aate hai
 Then how is such a false story prevalent in Kerala
 
 
 '' aalekh main kaha gaya he ki vastav main bhagwaan vishnu ne mahabali ko patallok bhejkar unhen dandit nahin kiya tha, balki aashirwad diya tha
 The article says, there is no indication in spiritual texts like 'bhagavatam' or 'narayaniyam' or any other such book that the sacrifice was sent to Patalalok
 ulte, aise granth kehete hai ki mahaan raja vaaman kii pariksha main vijayi hokar saamne aae ore unhen bhagwaan ne aashirwad diya
 
 
 The author criticized Mahabali as a 'mustache' with a big mustache, a long belly and a palm leaf umbrella
 unhone likhaa, ''yah kuch nihit swaarthee tatwon kii puranic kahaniyon ko tod-marodakar pesh karne or hindu puraanon kii galat chhavi pesh karne kii koshish he
 Such efforts should be stopped
 
 
 '' According to legends, Onam is associated with Asuraraj Mahabali, under whose rule all people lived with prosperity and equality
 unki lokapriyata se irshyaa karne vaale devataaon ne bhagwaan vishnu se unhen patallok main bhejne main madad maangi
 But before going to Patalalok, Mahabali received a boon from Lord Vishnu that he would come every year on the day of 'tiru Onam' to meet his subjects
 daityaraj ke isi vaarshik aagaman par keralavasi khushi manaate hai or apane gharon ko sajaate hai, nae-nae kapade pahante hai
 The rss's view on Onam has sparked a debate on centuries-old recognition
 kerala kii mantri shyalaja ne kaha, ''shaayad nichali jatiyaan yaa daliton ko hamaari puranic gaathaon main asur ke rup main pesh kiya gaya he
 The Mahabali is considered as Asura Raja, hence he represents the Dalits
 
 
 '' unhone kaha, ''aresas kaa vartmaan kadam dalit shashan kii uplabdhiyon ko mitaanaa or yah dikhaanaa he ki oonchi jati sarvocch he
 
 
 '' Comments vaise mashhoor itihaaskaar or bhartiya itihaas shodh parishad ke purv adhyaksh mgs narayanan ne kaha, ''mahabali ek puranic charitra he or unki kahani kaa itihaas se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 But there are historical quotes that Onam was celebrated in the state as Vaman Jayanti during the early period, especially between 9-11 century
 
 
 '' vaise vivaad se pare log is parv kii taiyaari main jor-shor se jute hai
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed

 The Indian Ambassador to France has misconstrued reports in the Indian media that it was said that the French government itself has ordered the Rafale aircraft to be taken at about half the cost of India

 It was said in the reports that the French government has upgraded about 28 Rafale aircraft from Dassault Aviation / Next Generation version
 3 arab pound main kharidne kaa order diya he
 It is being told that the news itself appeared in the French leading newspaper Le Figaro on January 14 and that the newspaper itself is owned by the Dassau Group, so it should be considered credible
 khabar ke anusaar april 2015 main narendra modi sarkaar ne 36 vimaan ke liye sauda 7
 87 billion dollars (although the government itself has not yet disclosed the price)
 lekin france sarkaar ne isaki safai main kaha he ki 2 arab euro kaa jo aankada bataaya ja rahaa he, vah asal main rafel ke nae epa4 vairient ke vikaas ke liye he, vimaan kharidne ke liye nahin
 Reacting to the news of the National Herald, Ambassador Alexander Ziegler to France said, "france has not placed an order for the purchase of any new aircraft tomorrow!" The amount you are talking about is only for the development of Rafael's new F4 standard
 air force ko jis 28 rafel delivery milane kii baat kii ja rahi he, vah bhi pehle kii kharid saude ke tahat he
 'france did not announce yesterday any new aircraft acquisition order! The amount you're referring to will finance solely the development of the new F4 standard for the # Rafale

 Prashant Bhushan, a senior Supreme Court lawyer and activist who filed a petition against the Rafael deal, immediately tweeted after the news of France's purchase of the aircraft, 'what it! The French government is buying 28 upgraded Rafale aircraft for 2 billion euros

 During PM Modi's visit to France in 2015, India and France signed an agreement on the purchase of this aircraft

 At the beginning of the year 2017, there are plans to give two big gifts to railway passengers by Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu
 1 janvari se desh bhar kii sabhi trainon main vikalp kii suvidha lagu hone ja rahi he
 Under this scheme, if your railway ticket is in waiting and could not be confirmed in that train, then the railway administration will call you and offer you that the berth in any other train on your route is empty
 rail mantri kii taraf se doosraa bada tohfa yah he ki sabhi trainon main arakshit siton ke liye pehla chart banane ke baad cancil hui tikaton ko 10 fisadi kii chhot ke saath 1 janvari kii taarikh se bechaa jayega
 Facility will be available in all trains of the country
 
 
 aisa nahin he ki yah vikalp suvidha kinhin vishesh trainon ke liye he
 From the new year, rail passengers will get this option in all trains across the country
 railway ne desh main chalane vaali sabhi trainon ke liye vikalp tikat suvidha dene kaa faisla kiya he
 Rail passengers will be provided with option ticket from January 1
 vikalp tikat kii jaankaree aapke panjikrut mobile par esemes dwaara di jaaegi
 In return, not a single rupee will be charged from the passengers
 sahamat na hone par aap apana tikat cancil bhi karvaa sakate hai
 Canceled tickets will be sold at a discount after the first chart
 
 
 nae saal par 1 janvari se rail yatriyon ko duusari badi suvidha yah milane ja rahi he ki sabhi trainon main arakshit siton ke liye pehla chart banane ke baad cancil hui tikaton ko 10 fisadi kii chhot ke saath bechaa jayega
 In fact, 10% discount will be given in the basic fare of the last booking fare of the respective train
 yah vyavastha bhi 1 janvari se lagu ho jaaegi
 In the circular issued for this, the Ministry of Railways has decided to give a ten percent discount on fare bookings for the remaining seats after the first chart has been made in all trains
 pehla chart banane ke baad karant booking kii tikat par aakhri tikat ke kiraaye se das fisadi kam kiraaya liya jaayegaa
 Ticket inspector-general TTE has also been empowered to make tickets for passengers at ten per cent less fare for the vacant seats inside the train
 railway board dwaara jari circular ke mutabik 10 fisadi kii chhot sambandhit class kii antim book tikat ke basic fere main di jaaegi
 The reservation fee and superfast charge on the ticket will remain in force and service tax will be applicable as before

 On the question of misleading the Supreme Court on Rafael, he said that in the court we had given affidavit, we had clearly explained the process of Rafael Deal

 But there was misinterpretation
 abhi rafel kii report sieji ke paas he or vahaan se paas hone ke baad parliament or piesi ke paas jaaegi
 We have not missed a coat
 yah galati saamne aane ke baad ham sabase pehle court gaye or us galati ko thik karaayaa he
 Such mistakes keep happening and lawyers keep correcting it

 The defense minister further said that three subjects were raised in the writ petition filed in the Supreme Court regarding the Rafale issue

 Congress Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is misleading Rafael, alleging that Congress is misleading people on Rafael case
 lekin court ke faisle main yah saafe ho gaya he ki rafel saude main koi gadabadi nahin hui he
 Talking about the price, the Congress is also telling it wrong
 congress rafel kii keemat 500 million euro bataa rahi he, jo ki keval kaagajon main hawa baaji he or kah rahi he ki modi sarkaar ne 1600 million euro main inhen kharida he
 He targeted Congress President Rahul Gandhi and said that if he talks with his Defense Minister AK Antony, then he will understand all about the true value of Rafael
 unhone rafel kii 1600 million euro kii keemat ko samajhaate hue kaha ki yah vepan ke saath rafel kii keemat he
 What Congress is saying is only the base price of the aircraft
 isliye congress kii tulana puri tarah galat he
