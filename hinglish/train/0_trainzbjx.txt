 Bhanwari Devi had signed herself on warrant of her death, perhaps by blackmailing one of Rajasthan's most powerful politicians
 ek saal se zyada samay se jodhpur or jaipur ke siyaasi halkon main ek sex sidi ke bare main fusfusaahat suni ja rahi thi, jisamen tatkaaleen cabinet mantri mahipal maderna ke shaamil hone kii baat kahi ja rahi thi
 It was being told that in that CD, he is having a physical relationship with Bhanwari
 usamen kalai kii ghadi ke sivaa maderna ke sharir par kapade kaa ek soot bhi nahin he
 Bhanwari was well aware that if this CD came in front of people, then his life could be in danger
 tepe kii gai telephone kii ek baatcheet, jo rahasyamay dhang se is saal 4 november ko saarvajanik ho gai, main bhavari ko kehete hue suna ja saktaa he, ''donon sidi ajmer ke loker main hai
 23 November 2011: Look in pictures India Today 16 November 2011: Look in pictures India Today i will reveal the code of the locker
 mujhe kuch hua to wo sidi nikaal lenaa
 
 
 "and that was what was feared
 1 sitambar ko 36 varshiya nurse bhavari, jo kam-se-kam ek cabinet mantri or congress ke ek anya vidhayak kii mashooqa thi, kaa apharan ho gaya
 Nothing is known about his being alive or dead yet
 aadhikarik taur par vah gaayab he
 But of whom India Today spoke, hardly any of them believe that he is still alive
 uske gaayab hone ke pakhwaade bhar baad police sutron ne daawa kiya ki use jalaur ke bishnoi gang ke saath ek scorpiyo main jodhpur ke paas biraala se bhaagate hue dekha gaya tha
 a month later, the CBI was called for investigation
 jaanch agenciyon ko ab bhi uskaa koi ata-pataa nahin he
 Nor does it know whether she is alive or not
 jaanch agenciyaan us rahasyamay gang kaa pataa lagane main bhi kaamyaab nahin hui hai
 However, he has arrested two people in this connection
 ek chote str ke thekedaar sohanlal bishnoi ko mukhya sandigdh mana ja rahaa he
 He is the cousin of Malkhan Singh Bishnoi, the MLA from Luni
 malakhan ke saath bhavari ke 10 saal puraane prem sambandh kaa rahasy jodhpur main kisi se chupa nahin he
 Shahabuddin, a motor mechanic and an old criminal, is also in jail
 bhavari ko aakhri baar unheen ke saath dekha gaya tha
 Both are criminals in nature and apparently they may have committed the crime by taking a betel nut from someone
 unhen kisi aise shaks ne supaari di hogi jise bhavari ke gaayab hone se phayda hoga
 The CBI, which took over the case from Rajasthan Police on October 12, is looking for the third suspect, the rightful Ram Bishnoi
 bhavari ke gaayab hone ke peeche mukhya haath usee kaa mana ja rahaa he
 On the day Bhanwari went missing, 27 calls were made to Shahabuddin and Sohanlal from the right Ram's mobile
 9 november2011: tasveeron main dekhen india today2 november 201: tasveeron main dekhen india tudapulice sutron kaa yah bhi kahana he ki uske mobile ke jeepies ke mutabik, phone karne ke samay vah jaipur main maderna ke ghar ke paas tha
 Maderna also confirmed in a conversation with India Today that on September 1, the right Ram was at his house
 iske baad vah khud bhi 'gaayab' ho gaya
 Rama was seen in Jodhpur in the first week after his disappearance
 vah ab bhi faraar he
 What has been revealed is the CD, which was said to be still missing
 10 november ko kuch sthaneey tivi channelon par iske kuch hisson ko dhundhala karke prasaarit kiya gaya
 The 49-minute CD begins with Bhanwari and Maderna undressing each other
 camere main maderna kii fusfusaahat bhi kaid ho gai he, jisamen ve shahi andaaj main bahuvachan kaa prayog karte hue bhavari ke kaan main kehete hai, ''ham tumhen pyaar karte hai
 "bhanwari knew where the secret camera was kept
" isliye jab uski kapade utaarne kii baari aati he, to vah camere kii najar se dur hat jaati he
 Most of the CD shows her back or she is lying on her bed
 maderna camere ke konon ke maamle main itane bhaagyashaalee nahin rahe
 It did not take long for the CD to be created as an amateur or a conspiracy
 sidi par har taraf bavaal machane ke baad 15 november ko is saamanti rajya ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ko apane sabhi mantriyon se istipha dene ke liye kahana padaa
 Troubled, Gehlot has reshuffled the cabinet to make up for the loss from the incident
 agar bhavari ab bhi jivit he, to vah jarur muskaraa rahi hogi ki ek aurat ke saath insaaf hua
 In a second telephone taped conversation, which has now been revealed to everyone, he can be heard claiming that "ashok Sarkar's throne will be overturned in Rajasthan
" '' uskaa daawa sahi tha
 Bhanwari's deadliest mistake was that he tried to auction the CD to the person who paid the most money
 telephone par kii gai teen baatcheet se pataa chalata he ki jab vah maderna or apane bich sohanlal ko bichauliye ke taur par istemaal kar rahi thi, tabhi usne usase dilli main ek party se sampark karne ko bhi kaha
 Maderna apparently agreed to buy the CD
 is baatcheet main sohanlal ko bhavari se kehete hue suna ja saktaa he, ''maine maderna se baat kii he or ve paisa dene ko taiyaar hai
 "bhanwari cautions
" If they are ready for agreement, they will hand over both the cds to them, otherwise they will make one, two, three and many copies
 '' is baatcheet se jaahir he ki agar maderna paisa dene se inkaar karte hai to sidi ke ujagar hone kaa khatra he
 This is the threat which backfired for the assistant nurse of Borunda near Jodhpur
 19oktober 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india today12oktober 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india today5oktober 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india tudsiogar bhavari mar chuki he, to kisne uski hatya kii? kisne kuch hi dinon ke bheetar sidi or telephone kii teen baatcheet ko li kiya? kya jaipur main sabase oonche rajnatik str par kuch lipapoti karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he? ye sawaal ab gahalot ke rajasthan se baahar bhi gunjane lage hai
 If Gehlot had asked Maderna to resign immediately after Bhanwari's disappearance, he could have prevented the ill effects of this sex scandal
 police jaanch ke dauraan maderna kaa naam saamne aa chukaa tha or bhavari ke saath unke sambandhon ke bare main har koi jaanata tha
 Bhanwari, the youngest of seven siblings, was born in a poor household
 ajmer se 25 kimi dur kishangarh main aditya soot mil main uske mata-pita dihadi mazdooree karte the
 She was educated in a government school till class eight, after which at the age of 14 she was married to Amar Chand, a senior secondary student of Borunda village in Jodhpur
 bhavari ke sasur, jo sarkari swasthya karmchaaree the, ne use nurse banane ke liye protsaahit kiya
 Young Bhanwari was appointed as an assistant nurse and midwife (midwife) in Jaisalmer in 1999
 iske baad hi use pehali baar paison se milane vaali aazaadee kaa ehsaas hua
 8,000 per month
 vetan paane vaali bhavari apana paisa studio main tasviren khinchvaane or pati ke haathon main haath daalkar shahar ke parkon main ghoomane main kharch karne lagi
 Perhaps then he decided to earn more money for himself and his family
 vah apane bete sahil ko paas ke bhilwara shahar ke ek achche college main bhejnaa chaahati thi or apni do betiyon-ashvini or suhaani-ko shikshit karnaa chaahati thi taaki unhen uski tarah abhaavon vaali jindagi na gujaarni pade
 She wanted to use l'oreal cream and Aloe Vera (gheekwar) Zel
 usne 2009 main apane pati ke liye ek safawd maaruti swift kharidi taaki vah taxi sarvice chalaa sake
 In 2011 she bought an Indigo car for her husband
 use jo kuch mila tha usase vah apni jindagi sanvarna chaahati thi
 But now his family members see it differently
 uske bade bhai kishor rajnat, jo kishangarh main rahete hai or shaadiyon main baaja bajaane vaala band chalaate hai, kehete hai, ''bhavari laalchee or mahatvakankshi thi
 Unlike CBI, he now uses the past tense for his sister
 bhai kaa maananaa he ki khatarnaak avaidh sambandhon kii vajah se uski hatya kar di gai
 Amar Chand, sitting on the cot outside her two-bedroom, two-bedroom, pink and blue house, says, "she is just 21,000 as a nurse
 pratimah kamaati thi
 She also earned some money by working in local music videos
 bhavari kathak kii acchhee nrutyaangna thi
 She approached the music video to play a role in the advertisement
 lekin ve maanate hai ki pichley ek saal se vah tanaav main thi or kinhin khyaalon main khoi-khoi rahati thi
 Her health was also deteriorating, she became depressed, she was also taking injections for thyroid and depression
 lekin uske pati ko un dawaaiyon kaa naam nahin pataa he
 Perhaps for fear of losing his physical attraction, Bhanwri decided to make a CD as a one-time lottery
 borunda ke apane ghar main amar chand canvas ke bag se ek bachche kii copy nikaalte hai
 On each of his pages, he has pasted clippings of his wife's disappearing news
 bhavari ke 40 varshiya pati ke paas ab apni patni se sambandhit yah copy or ek daraaj main bhari uski tasviren hi rah gai hai
 Yes, he also has purchased cars
 28 sitambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india today21 sitambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india today7sitambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india todeve kehete hai ki 1 sitambar ko unki patni apane saath sidi bhi le gai thi or us roj ke baad vah ghar nahin lauti
 Bhanwari told him that he had a CD, "for which someone is paying to keep quiet
" ''amar chand kaa yah bhi kahana he ki unhen us samay yah nahin pataa tha ki us sidi main kya he
 He came to know about that CD when he saw it on TV all over Rajasthan
 unke do bade bachche bhi ab us sidi ke bare main jaanate hai
 The youngest daughter, Suhani, seven years old, is unaware of this at home
 use ab bhi yakeen he ki ek din raat ko uski maa use dulaar ke saath sulaane ke liye waapas aa jaaegi
 While 15-year-old Ashwini is in a boarding school in Jaipur and 17-year-old Sahil is silent
 vah apni maa ke gaayab hone ke baad se ghar se baahar nahin niklaa he, ''kyonki mere paas maa ke bare main logon ke sawaalon kaa koi jawaab nahin he
 "he wipes an eyebrow with the sleeve of his T-shirt, which has the Playboy's famous rabbit printed
" amar chand ke mutabik, unki patni ne unhen bataaya tha ki vah sohanlal se milane bilara ja rahi he
 Amar Chand says, "he (sohanlal) used to visit us for the last two years
 
 The last time he came was on 27 August and my wife tied a rakhi to him
 '' police ko die gaye sohan ke bayaan or apane pati ko bataai gai bhavari kii jaankaree ke mutabik, sohanlal uski do saal puraani dijal swift car 4
 75 lakhs
 main kharidne ke liye raji ho gaya tha, jabaki bazaar main aisi hi nai car kii keemat 4
 69 lakhs
 se 5
 5 lakhs
 ke bich he
 She already paid him Rs 50,000
 de chukaa tha or baaki kii rakam unke ghar se 35 kimi dur bilara main dene ke liye raji tha
 Bhanwari recently bought a new Indigo car for her husband after the Swift car was already delivered to Sohanlal
 amar chand in do kaaron se apni taxi sarvice chalaate the
 On the ill-fated day of September 1, the Indigo car broke down
 isliye bhavari ne dopaher 1
 Traveled by bus at 30
 amar chand ke mutabik, us din dopaher baad 4 baje unhone phone par bhavari ko bataaya ki indigo thik ho gai he or ve use waapas lene ke liye aa sakate hai
 But Bhanwari refuses, saying that Sohanlal will leave her
 apni patni ke saath yahi unki aakhri baatcheet thi
 When that evening 6
 30 baje tak ghar waapas nahin ai to amar chand ne dobaaraa use phone kiya
 He says, "my wife's mobile was off
" '' phir unhone sohanlal ko phone lagaaya to usne bataaya ki bablu (bhavari ghar main pyaar se isi naam se bulaai jaati thi) to usase mili hi nahin
 At 9 pm, Amar Chand got worried and went to Sohanlal's house himself
 ve kehete hai, ''uski patni ne kaha ki vah baahar gaya he
 "now Amar got worried
 ve agali subah 9
 At 30 AM, went to Borunda's police station to write a report about Bhanwari's disappearance
 police adhikari ne kaha ki report likhaane se pehle ve bilara main khud uski talash karen
 Hours later the police called him and advised him to lodge a complaint in Bilara
 ve bataate hai, ''maine dobaaraa sohanlal ko phone kiya or kaha ki bablu abhi tak ghar nahin lauti he
 He asked me, 'have any Jats done any work? (kya tumhen yakeen he ki kisi jat ne uski hatya to nahin kar di?)''do din baad 4 sitambar ko police mahanireekshak umesh mishra biraala aae or bhavari ke gaayab hone kii khojbin shuru kar di
 Click to read more news of India Today, Sohanlal was arrested by registering an FIR, whose number was 383-11, in Bhanwari's abduction case on 5 September
 usamen maderna kaa koi zikr nahin tha
 According to police sources, during the interrogation, Sohanlal said that he handed over Bhanwari to Shahabuddin
 bhavari jaahiri taur par shahabuddin ko raju bhaiya ke taur par jaanati thi
 Sohanlal said that Bhanwari went to Shahabuddin's Bolero with her and the driver
 sohanlal ke mutabik, bhavari ko usne tabhi aakhri baar dekha tha
 Shahabuddin claims that he handed over Bhanwari to a few people in a Scorpio
 police ke ek sutara ke mutabik, ''usne kaha ki vah un logon ko jaanati thi or unke saath borunda waapas janaa chaahati thi
 "the investigation came to a halt here
 vibhinn kadiyon ko jodne or yah jaanane kii koi koshish nahin kii gai ki sohanlal ne kiske kehane par bhavari ko shahabuddin ke hawaale kiya tha
 Interestingly, Sohanlal has a good relationship with Maderna
 vah jan swasthya or ejineering vibhaag main thekedaari karata he
 Maderna was till recently the minister of this department
 shuru main maderna ne kaha ki ve bhavari ko nahin jaanate the
 But when the CD was revealed, he confessed the truth
 unhone sibiai ko bataaya ki bhavari se unke rishte to the, lekin uski gumshudagi main unka koi haath nahin he
 After the CBI interrogation on November 11, his wife Leela Maderna's reply was, "it is not a crime to have a love affair with someone and make a CD of it
 '' lekin unki ankhon par chadhe diziner chashme ne unki dili bhaawanaaon ko chupa liya
 In such a situation, it is not surprising that on November 14, the Jodhpur bench of the Rajasthan High Court pulled up the CBI for laxity in investigation
 jodhpur main atirikt mahadhivaktaa anand purohit kehete hai, ''sibiai ne chaar hafte kii maang kii thi, lekin adaalat ne unhen 10 din ke bheetar bhavari ke thikaane ke bare main jaankaree dene ko kaha
 
 
 To date no evidence of his murder has been found
 police sibiai ke saath sahyog kar rahi he
 The court also warned the CBI that the case should not fall into the same manner as the Aarushi Talwar murder case in Noida, a suburb of Delhi
 sibiai maderna se do baar or malakhan se teen baar poochtacha kar chuki he
 During interrogation, the CBI also brought the two together face to face, as Maderna said that it was Malkhan who introduced Bhanwari to them
 pehle to malakhan ne isse inkaar kiya, lekin baad main maan liya
 Malkhan's sister Indira Bishnoi, who was close to Bhanwari, reported on November 7 that Bhanwari had met Gehlot last year and told him about the CD
 gahalot ne kabhi bhi jor dekar is baat se inkaar nahin kiya he
 His response to this charge was, "I meet many people every day
" main yah yaad nahin rakh saktaa ki koun mujhase mila or koun nahin
 But it is news to me that Bhanwari told me about the videotape related to Maderna
 ''sthaneey congress kaaryakarta bataate hai ki disambar, 2008 main gahalot ke mukhyamantri banane ke shuruaati chah maheene ke dauraan maderna mukhyamantri kaa virodh karne kaa koi avasar nahin ganvaate the
 But after a year, there was a sudden change and Maderna started accepting everything of the Chief Minister
 congress ke ek vidhayak kaa kahana he, ''shaayad gahalot ne unhen sidi ko saarvajanik karne kii dhamkee se unhen daraa diya tha
 "sometime in 2003, Malkhan introduced Bhanwari to Maderna, as she wanted to transfer a friend
" phir rajnatik sampark paane ke laalach main ek sahaayak nurse khatarnaak raah par chal padi
 There are also reports that Bhanwari had relations with other politicians as well, but the name of none other than Maderna and Malkhan has been revealed
 amar chand kehete hai ki unhen sirf do logon kii jaankaree thiah ''koi aurat apane pati ko in baton ke bare main nahin bataati he
 i suspected from her phone conversation that she was related to both of them (maderna and Malkhan)
 ''aisi bhi afvaahen hai ki uskaa ek baccha vastav main malakhan se rishton ke kaaran paidaa hua tha or bhavari diene test karaane kii icchhuk thi
 Amar Chand says, "children belong to me
" yah main khud kah saktaa hum
 "but the rumors are not going to stop
" ek sthaneey vyapaaree kaa daawa he ki malakhan kii beti kii shaadi ke dauraan bhavari ne vahaan tamaasha khadaa kar diya tha
 She was saying that one of her daughters, whom she said was born of Malkhan, should get equal rights
 agar sthaneey afvaahon par yakeen kiya jaae to aisi anek ghatnaayen ho chuki thim, jinamein se ek ghatana pichley saal jodhpur main malakhan ke hero honda showrooms kii he
 Says a local businessman, "bhanwari and Malkhan were seen as spouses
" maderna or bhavari saarvajanik rup se kabhi saath nahin dekhe gaye
 "the impact of money can be seen in the disorganized form of Bhanwari's house in Borunda
" angan main ek frij rakhaa he, jiske upar ek chota televijan rakhaa he
 a matka is also placed in front of the fridge
 rasoi main steel ke bartan hai, lekin bathroom ke baahar washing mashin bhi rakhi he
 a treadmill is also present in this village house surrounded by millet fields
 uske bistar ke bagal main ek purana transistor bhi rakhaa he
 Amar Chand talks about his wife's hobby with a smile, "he was very fond of wearing nice clothes
" '' unhone exiar main likhaaya tha ki vah ghar se ''bhure rang kii diziner sari pahanakar gai thi
 "bhanwari's shot has reached Delhi
 tivi par sidi ke saamne aane se pehle hi gahalot teen hafte ke bheetar kam-se-kam teen baar daudkar dilli ja chuke the
 He met Congress President Sonia Gandhi twice
 congress ke ek mahasachiv bataate hai, ''unhen ek aakhri mauka diya gaya he
 Although the influence of the Maderna family is limited to some Jatabahul areas of Jodhpur, it is the first sex scandal that has rocked Rajasthan
 gahalot sarkaar par bhrashtachar or aakshamata ke aarope lagate rahe hai, lekin ab is fehrist main avaidh sambandh bhi jud gaya he
 This is not a sex scam alone
 ek sthaneey akhbaar ne 29 sitambar kii apni report main ek anya cabinet mantri raamalaal jat ko is tarah ke maamle main lipt bataaya he
 It has been revealed in that report that Paras Devi, a female friend of Jat, committed suicide on 27 September
 jat us samay bhilwara main apane nirvachan kshetra main jila parishad kii baithak kar rahe the
 They ran to the hospital and started pressing for post mortem of the dead body the same night
 unhen jab bataaya gaya ki postmortem agle din hoga to ve laash ko duusare aspataal le gaye lekin doctoron ke abhaav main waapas lautnaa padaa
 The post mortem did not reveal anything suspicious
 lekin visra report kii abhi pratiksha kii ja rahi he
 But Jat's behavior that night arouses suspicion

 gopalgarh or bhavari kii ghatnaon kaa asar un donon hi samudaayon par pad saktaa he, jinhen uttar pradesh main congress apni ore kheenchna chaahati he
 Gehlot too is aware of this
 11 november ko unhone media ko bataaya ki ''yah ghatana aisi he jisase kisi ke bhi rongte khadey ho sakate hai
 She was a Dalit woman and the way she was kidnapped and subsequent incidents are very frightening
 ''yakeenan mukhyamantri ke keval rongte hi khadey nahin honge
 If they cannot prevent rot, they can also be removed

 kushal prashaasak joshi ko congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi kaa bhi varadahast praapt he
 Another name is Jitendra Singh, who fits into the plan to bring forward the new generation of Ra'el Gandhi

 Leader of the Opposition Vasundhara Raje says, "empty makeup cannot hide the facial stains that Bhanwari has given
 mukhyamantri ko aisi sharmindagi se rajya ko bachaane ke liye istipha dena chahie
 Whatever number of meetings you have with your ministers, but ultimately you will have to decide
 ''bhavari bam se ghayal hone vaale mukhyamantri gahalot akele nahin hai

 Thackeray, who came to the national capital for the first time after Modi got an important role in the BJP, said that he had given him 'best wishes' at the beginning when Modi came to his residence after becoming the chairman of the Central Election Campaign Committee
 tippaniyan Uddhav Thackeray said, why should i clarify those things which i have not said in my speech
 media bhi samaaj kaa ek jimmedaar tabaka he
 He also said, you people will say that Uddhav has taken a U-turn
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar kaa naam tay karne kii jimmedaari pehle bhaajapa ke sansadeey board kii he, phir vah apane sahyogiyon jaise shivasena ore akali dal se salaah karegi

 Accusing the media of misinterpreting his statement, he told reporters, "when i said yesterday that the country needs a credible face, i was speaking in the context of Congress, which is in power now
" main congress ke bare main baat kar rahaa tha
 In response to a question, Thackeray made it clear that issues related to Hindutva like Ram Mandir are not likely to become important in the election, because of the 'difficult problems faced by the common people due to' Congress misrule '
 Need to be stressed

 Media is also a responsible section of society
 saath hi unhone kaha, aap hi log kahenge ki uddhav ne you-turn le liya he
 He said that the responsibility of deciding the name of the prime ministerial candidate is first with the bjp's parliamentary board, then it will consult its allies like Shiv Sena and Akali Dal
 netritv ke maamle par sabhi sawaalon ko darkinar karte hue unhone kaha ki yah baat chuphi nahin he ki uchit prakriya kaa paalan kiya jayega

 Looking at the condition of the express on the first day, it seems that if you want to travel safely on this, then you should wait a few months

 input IANS These days, on various social media platforms, the picture of a bank-stamped passbook is going viral, stating that only up to one lakh rupees of your deposits in the bank are insured
 yani agar bank dub jaataa he jo aapaki puri jamaa main se sirf ek lakh rupye kii waapas milenge
 Before debating whether this photo is true or not, it is important to know that the information that is being viral with the help of it is actually correct
 diposit insurance and credit guarantee korporation (diisijisi) kii ore se bainkon par diya jane vaala beemaa ek lakh rupye tak kii raashi par hi he
 This rule applies equally to all the assets kept in the bank's locker, fixed deposits i
e
 FD, money deposited in savings account etc
 diisijisi, bhartiya rigerv bank kii hi ek sabsidari he
 At a time when the PMC bank is under the question, then somewhere in the mind of every bank account holder the question is whether my money is safe in the bank? It should also be kept in mind that till today any big private or in India The public bank has not defaulted

 The first is a strict regulator like RBI and the second is to save crores of countrymen
 bharat main bank apni jamaa ke kaaran dhandha kar paa rahe hai
 At a time when there is a lack of trust among crores of bank account holders in the country, should the government not increase the limit on the amount of insured deposits to strengthen the courage of the depositors

 Currently government demand is 2-3 per cent, while private investment demand is also at a weak level of 5-6 per cent

 It had also shown that planned investment in 2016 was almost over
 aise main maang ko protsaahan dene ke do hi tareeke hai
 One is that the government prefers capital expenditure and maintains it
 doosraa maudrik upaay he yani byaaj daron main katautee
 a major problem facing the government is that it has a borrowing limit, as it also has to meet its fiscal deficit target
 iske alaava vah vyay ko na badha sakati he or na katautee kar sakati he kyonki adhikansh pehle se tay hai
 About 80 per cent of revenue expenditure is fixed on salary, pension and interest payments
 sarkaar agar apana vyay badhaati bhi he to use tikaae rakhana mushkil hoga
 For the next three years, the world economy will remain similarly sluggish
 isse na sirf bharat ke niryaat par asar padegaa balki mek in india abhiyaan bhi prabhavit hoga
 Countries like China have developed capacity, so they are more likely to increase their sales in India

 Under this, states can be allowed to borrow more than the prescribed three percent of gross state domestic product (GSDP) from the market

 Not only this, two criminal cases against Manorama Devi are also in court, yet she was given three arms licenses
 ek rifl, ek revolver or ek donali bandook ke liye
 Rocky may have used any of these weapons in the incident in which an innocent was killed and that death has become a question mark on the government's credibility

 america ne yah tippanee uttar korea dwaara suraksha parishad ko bheje gaye ek patr ke jawaab main kii he
 In the letter, North Korea has stated that it has reached the final stage of the uranium enrichment process
 america videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa ian keli ne kaha, ‘‘uttar korea ko apane kisi bhi tarah ke parmaanu kaarykram se peeche hatane kii jarurat he
 He should try to fulfill the commitment he made in September 2005

" ek prashn ke jawaab main unhone kaha, ‘‘ham in daavon ko lekar bahut chintit hai jinamein kaha gaya he ki uttar korea parmaanu hathiyaar banane ke behad kareeb pahunch chukaa he
 He said that America is worried about these claims, but no one can confirm the truth about these claims
 agar aap rojaanaa petrol pump kii qatari main nahin bhi lagate hai tab bhi kachche tel kii badhati keemton kii maar se khud ko achoota na samajhen
 Apart from the rising prices of petrol and diesel, the boiling oil inflation may not be a topic of discussion, but it makes you poke in your pocket
 masalan, beete kuch maheenon main agar rashan kaa bill bad gaya ho, biscuit, chips, sabun, surf ke packet kaa vajan gata ho, ghar par paint karwaane kaa kharchaa ummid se zyada aa rahaa ho yaa auto-tempo waalon ne kiraaya badha diya ho, to hairaan mat hoie, ye sab kachche tel kii badhati keemton ke hi said effect hai
 Indeed, many other industries, including paints, plastics, packaging materials, textiles, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, use oil or products made from it
 aise main kachche tel kii keemten badaae par companiyon kii laagat bad jaati he or companiyaan kai raaston se ise upabhokta tak pahunchaati hai
 This is the reason why many small things like daily use such as paints, polishes, buckets, mugs, candles, chips, biscuits, Vaseline, soap, surf, umbrella, perfumes, nail polishes, either go up or Companies reduce the amount of baggage inside the packet
 gauratlab he ki beete ek saal ke dauraan kachche tel kii keemton main 43 fisadi se zyada kii badhotaree hui he
 Crude oil price 57 in the international market in September 2017
 54 dollar prati bairal (kareeb 159 litre) ke str par thi, vahiin sitambar 2018 main bhav 82 dollar ke kareeb the
 Oil boom is remaining, both global and domestic markets are expected to continue to rise in crude oil prices
 karvi stock broking ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari rajeev singh kehete hai, "2018 ke ant tak kachche tel kii keemten 90 dollar prati bairal kaa str chhu sakati hai
 If the price of crude oil for the entire year remains at $ 90, then 0 on the government's current account deficit
 3 fisadi kaa atirikt boj padegaa
 "increasing crude oil prices bring inflation for the common man, as well as a headache for the government
 rajeev kehete hai, "kachche tel kii badhati keemton ke kaaran jin kshetron kii companiyon par sabase zyada asar hota he unamem aviation, transport and logistic, paint, emmemasiji, tair, petro chemical, cement pramukh hai
 "the profits of companies in these sectors will be hurt by one to three and a half percent, which will also affect the prices of the products
" aise main sarkari aankadon main bhale aapako mahangaai badhati na dikhe lekin tyohaaron kii kharidari ke dauraan jameen par aap ise jarur mahasoos kar sakenge
 Packaged inflation has a special importance in most of the products sold today
 emmemasiji companiyaan hon yaa cosmetics—graahakon ko aakarshith karne ke liye utpaadon kii packing par khaasaa dhyaan detii hai
 Rajesh Bhatia, chief financial officer of UFLEX, the country's giant in the packaging material sector, says, "50 per cent of the cost of the packaging material industry is from crude oil products
 aise main jis tarah beete ek varsh main kachche tel kii keemten takreeban 50 fisadi badi hai usee anupaat main packaging film bhi mahangi hui he
 Apart from raw materials, transportation costs have also increased due to rising prices of petrol and diesel
 rajesh kehete hai, "company ke margin par khaas asar nahin padegaa kyonki hamane puri badhotaree apane graahak companiyon ko aage badha di he
 In such a situation, it is natural to increase inflation at the consumer level
 '' companiyon ke bijness main 15 se 20 fisadi tak hissedari packaging kii hoti he
 The biggest impact is on companies whose packets are large, the amount of goods inside is small
 misaal ke taur par, chips, namakeen aadi
 Diwali will be expensive
 This Diwali, you will have to spend more money, from buying candles to getting your house painted, to light up your home
 barger paints india limited ke prabandh nideshak or mukhya kaaryakari adhikari abhijit roy kehete hai, "global market kii tarj par gharelu bazaar main bhi kachche tel kii keemton main oochaal aayaa he
 Paint companies have raised prices twice this year to reduce the impact of increased costs
 '' paint, thinar in sab chizon kaa istemaal ghar main paint karaane ke dauraan hota he
 Rising oil prices make all these things expensive
 roy yah bhi kehete hai, "samay ke saath logon kii pasand bhi badal rahi he, isi vajah se shaharon main premium product kii demand lagaataar bad rahi he
 Rajeev Sharma, director of Rajiv Chemical Private Limited, a company that supplies chemicals to the textiles and paper industry, says, "due to the rise in crude oil prices, the price of dye used in the textile industry in the last one year has been more than 30%
 Has increased
 iske alaava transport kii laagat main bhi badhotaree hui he
 This will affect the prices of clothes
 '' textiles industry main daai se judi laagat kaa hissaa 30 se 35 fisadi hota he
 Polyester is also a byproduct of crude oil, which is used in making large quantities of clothes
 aise main diwaali par k padon kii keemat aapako pichley saal se zyada milegi
 Due to the increase in the prices of petrol and diesel, there has also been an increase in the fares of freight and passenger cars
 ol india motor transport congress main dilli-ensiaar ke chairman trilochan singh dhillon kehete hai, "dijal kii keemat jaise-jaise badhati jaati he, kiraye main badhotaree hoti jaati he
 There has been a 25 per cent increase in truck fares compared to last year
 '' maal dhulaai badaae kaa asar bade str par hota he
 On the one hand, the vegetables from the village to the mandi of the cities become expensive, on the other hand the taxi fares in the cities increase

 R
, deputy general manager (imports), Supreme Industries, a plastic products company
 padmasanan kehete hai, "plastic product banane ke liye jaruri ro material kaa aayaat kiya jaae to keemton main bahut zyada badhotaree nahin hui he, lekin transportesan kii laagat 20 fisadi tak bad gai he jiske kaaran upabhokta ko saamaan mahangaa mil rahaa he
 90,000 for three months before sending trucks from Mumbai to Delhi
 lagate the, ab 1,15,000 ru
 It costs aise main upabhokta ko nishchit taur par plastic se bani chijen mahangi milengi
 Padmashanan says, "A major reason for inflation in the country is the loopholes in the tax structure
 mumbai main petrol 90 rupye litre he, jisamen 47 rupye tex he
 This is a major part of tax-driven inflation
 ''rupye kii kamajori se gaharaa hua dardek dollar kii keemat 74 dollar ke paar nikal chuki he
 Since January, the rupee has lost 14 per cent against the dollar
 bazaar ke maujuuda halaat rupye kii kamajori ke or gahraane kaa sanket de rahe hai
 The weak rupee is adding to the inflation of crude oil
 bharat apni kul khapat kaa kareeb 80 fisadi tel aayaat karata he
 The weak rupee costs more dollars to import crude oil
 iskaa asar sarkari khajaane se lekar aam aadmi kii jeb tak hota he
 If we see a list of things made from crude oil products, then life will not be possible without oil
 kaccha tel jab apane nichle str par tha to tex kii maar ke kaaran bhale mahangaai main kami mahasoos na hui ho lekin tyohaaron par feeki padati raunak mahangaai kaa ehsaas jarur kara degi
 Pray that soon the equation in the global market chaser is such that oil price will cool down

 a bench of five judges is hearing in the Supreme Court on the practice of triple talaq involving Muslims
 court ne is maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan saaf kiya ki ve yah samiksha karenge ki teen talaak dharm kaa abhinn ang he yaa nahin
 While Aaj Tak reporter talked to Maulana Syed Shahabuddin Salfi Firdausi of Pune, he clearly said that the Holy Book of Muslims does not mention three divorces together in the Quran
 firdausi ke mutabik, ek hi baithak main teen dafetlaak,talaak,talaakkahakar patni ko talaak dene kaa quran main kahin bhi nahin likhaa he
 Therefore, hurrying divorces in this way is making fun of Islam and atrocities on Muslim women
 ajtak se baatcheet main moulana firdausi kehete hai, islam ne talaak kaa jo tarika bataaya he, usamen ek hi baithak main teen talaak vaali baat nahin utarati he, isliye patni ko is tarah talaak dena galat he or halaalamuslim auratonki izzat par daaka daalana or unki izzat ko taar-taar karnaa he
 Halala also has no connection with Islam
 talaak kaa sahi tarika puche jane par moulana firdausi ne kaha, muslamaanon ke dharmik granth quran majid main bataaya gaya he ki shuhar ko talaak dene kii jaldbaaji nahin kerani chahie
 He should first try to convince his wife
 pehali koshish yani step number van- donon ke bich jis baat par tanaav he, vah donon ke hi bich rahani chahie or shuhar ko apni bibi ko naseehat deni chahie, samajhaana chahie or saath rahane kii baat kerani chahie
 If wife is not agreeing on this, then she should stop making physical relations with him
 is dauraan pati patni ko ekasaath ek hi kamare main sona he, lekin shaareerik sambandh nahin rakhana chahie
 Even if this second step does not work, both of them should tell their acquaintances and elders about their distance and they should once again explain to Mia and Biwi
 firdausi bataate hai, sulah kii in teen koshishon ke baad pati-patni ko teen maheene kaa samay ek ghar main hi gujaarna he or iske baad talaak kaa kadam uthaanaa chahie, jiskaa sahi tarika teen steps kaa he
 Step 1: After these three attempts between the four walls, if both do not agree, then keep the witness and tell the husband to wife that i have divorced you and after that stay in a house together for one month and in the same bed
 But to sleep, but not to have physical relationship with wife during this time is ek maheene main agar pati kaa man badal gaya or use patni ke saath gruhasti jari rakhni he, to vah shaareerik sambandh bana sakate hai
 Step-2: If there is no reconciliation in mia-biwi during this time, then next month the husband has to say to the wife for the second time, i divorced you
 iske baad bhi pati ko bivi ke saath ghar main hi rahanaa he or ek bistar par sona he or agar duusare maheene main bhi shaareerik sambandh nahin banataa he, to phir tisare maheene main baat jaati he
 Step-3: Even for the third month, the husband has to say to the wife for the third time that i have divorced you, then it is understood that the divorce has happened
 moulana saiyad shahabuddin salphi firdausi kehete hai, islam main talaak kaa yahi tarika bataaya gaya he
 He says, if the husband gave the two divorces with a tongue, and there was no talk between the two, and three months passed and the two separated
 phir bhi kuch samay baad agar donon chahen to phir se nikaah karke saath rah sakate hai
 According to Maulana Firdausi, he has written to reputed Maulanas across the country about this correct method of divorce for the last 36 years, but no one has so far denied or endorsed the written form
 
 phirdosi ke mutabik, isi vajah se unhone ab media ke saamne apni baat rakhana kaa faisla kiya

 He made Swami Vivekananda his disciple
 jaane unke bare main
 
 
 - Ramakrishna Paramahamsa spent most of his life like a supreme devotee
 vah kaali ke bhakt the
 Kali was not a goddess for him, she was a living reality
 jaane, upanyaaskaar veda prakaash sharma ke bare main ye khaas baaten- 12 saal kii umr tak wo skool gaye lekin shiksha vyavastha kii kamiyon ke chalate unhone janaa band kar diya
 - He had good knowledge of Purana, Ramayana, Mahabharata and Bhagavata Purana

 - bataa den, ramakrishna bahut chote hi the jab unke pita kaa nidhan ho gaya tha
 - This idea of seeing God in the mind of Ramakrishna first came in the shape of a stubbornness, but later it turned into a devotional search
 swami vivekanand kii ye 10 baaten bana dengi aapkaa bhavishya- ve ishwar ko khojane lage or uske liye tadapane lage
 In search of him, he left the temple and moved to a nearby forest
 ishwar-darshan kii bechaini or adheeratha badhane lagi thi or unka vyavhaar asaamaanya hone laga tha
 - He began to feel that if there is such a thing as religion and God, then he should also live up to the human experience

 However, the video does not show Kanhaiya shouting anti-india slogans

 On the day Kanhaiya was arrested, another video was played in the court room
 tippaniyan In the seven-minute video, a young man with half his face is seen shouting slogans demanding 'azad Kashmir'
 uski pahchaan abhi tak nahin hui he
 In this video, some youths are asking police officers to leave the premises

 After the passage of three divorce bills in the Lok Sabha, now it is the turn of the Rajya Sabha
 centre sarkaar ne aaj upree sadan main teen talaak bill ko pesh kiya
 In such a situation, once again the opposition is now a test of strength, because the NDA does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha and the opposition is strong
 lekin jis tarah RTI bill or UAPA bill ke dauraan hua or vipakshi ekta main send lag gai to modi sarkaar ke liye ek badi kamyaabi hogi
 Read the entire discussion in the Rajya Sabha on the triple talaq bill
 
 
 abaki baar rajyasabha main varloksabhaa main bhaajapa ke paas prachand bahumat he, yahi kaaran he ki teen talaak bill vahaan par aasaani se paas ho gaya
 But now the exam has to be held in Rajya Sabha
 congress, bijepi ne apane-apane saansadon ko vip jari kar diya he or sadan main upasthit rahane ko kaha gaya he
 In the last few days, as the Opposition has been continuously doing walkouts, it will not be easy for the government to pass the bill in the House this time too
 abhi kya kahata he number game?rajyasabha main kul sadasyon kii sankhya 245 he, lekin abhi 4 siten khaali hai
 In such a situation, the number of 121 is needed to get a majority
 vahiin agar number kii baat karen to endie ke paas apane dam par kul 104 kaa aankada he
 (BJP 78, JDU 6, Shiv Sena 3, Akali Dal 3, nominated-independent 12) Of these, JDU has spoken out against opposing the triple talaq bill
 vahiin vipaksh ke paas bhi 109 kii sankhya he
 However, YSR Congress, JDU, TRS and AIADMK are believed to be absent during voting in the house
 aise main inke maujuud naa hone se bhi fark padegaa
 The game will be like RTI bill and UAPA bill? Meanwhile, the opposition hopes that if it stops this bill, BJP also has faith in some of its friends
 kyonki RTI bill or UAPA bill ke dauraan jis tarah bijd, TRS or wiesar congress ne sarkaar kaa samarthan kiya tha, usase rajyasabha kaa puraa game hi palat gaya tha
 In Rajya Sabha, BJD has 7 mps, YSR has 2 and TRS has 6 mps
 yani jo NDA 104 par atka he agar uske saath ye 15 bhi aaj jate hai to use bahumat ke kareeb pahunchane main kuch aasaani hogi
 The Aam Aadmi Party will protest on the third divorce bill, Sanjay Singh says that this bill should be sent to the Select Committee There are many such issues which are wrong
 tripal talaak maamle ko criminlise kyon kiya gaya, aapraadhik banaakar ke ek khaas samudaay ko target kiya ja rahaa he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has three mps, all three will vote against it
 sanjay singh kaa kahana he ki jo log garibon ko or rape se prabhavit mahilaon ko nyaay nahin de sakate hai
 They have no right to bring a bill in this manner
 iske jariye sarkaar apni vot bank kii raajnneeti kar rahi he or raajnneetik rotiyaan sekane kaa prayaas kar rahi he ham is bill kaa virodh karte hai
 Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has canceled his visit to Switzerland in view of the recent terrorist attacks in the country
 yah jaankaree ravivaar ko unke karyaalay kii ore se di gai
 According to the news agency 'xinhua', a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office said, "prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has canceled his visit to Davos in Switzerland in view of the recent terrorist incidents and the Bannu tragedy
" " Sharif said in the statement, our country is against extremism and terrorism
 hamaare nagarikon or kanoon ko lagu karne vaali agenciyon ke karmiyon kaa balidaan vyarth nahin jayega
 The Prime Minister was scheduled to visit Switzerland on January 21 to represent Pakistan at the World Economic Forum in Davos
 pakistani taliban dwaara khabar pakhtoonkhwaa praant main ravivaar ko sena ke ek kafile par kiye hamale main kam se kam 22 surakshakarmi maare gaye the
 The tehreek-e-taliban (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack and said that attacks on security forces would continue
 beete shanivaar ko dilli bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne gokulpur gaanv main jaakar ek ghar kaa sil kiya hua taala apane haathon se tod diya tha
 Now the matter seems to take a new color
 darasal, somvaar subah jab 'ajtak' kii team ne is ilaake kaa daura kiya to logon ne bataaya ki makaan maalik prem singh is ghar main pichley kai saal se 2 bhens paalkar guzaara kar rahe the, lekin shuukravaar kii subah 6 baje emsidi team ne achaanak pahunchakar makaan ko sil kar diya
 Gokulpurgaon head Sonu Pahalwan said that the people of the corporation are harassing the people here, which is wrong
 gram pradhan ne bataaya ki hamaara gaanv laal doraa main aata he
 We are not running any factory here, we are raising buffalo here
 lekin laal doraa hone ke baavjood yahaan makaan ko sil kar diya gaya
 On Sunday, the villagers convened a panchayat to discuss the same issue and local MP Manoj Tiwari reached the same panchayat
 sthaneey nivaasiyon ke mutabik manoj tiwari ne manch se kaha ki janata emsidi se ceiling hone na den, uskaa virodh kare
 When the public informed MP Manoj Tiwari about Prem Singh's seal house, MP Manoj Tiwari himself broke the lock of that house
 maalik prem singh ne emsidi par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki jab wo makaan bana rahe the tab bhi unka lentre todaa gaya tha or iske badale emsidi ne unase 50 hajaar kii rishwat lee thi
 Prem Singh said that the MCD should have given them notice before sealing the house, but without giving notice, the house was sealed by coming straight
 jab makaan sil hua tab unke ghar main parivaar maujuud tha
 According to Prem Singh, at 6 in the morning, the MCD team came and sealed their families out
 ilaake ke logon ke mutabik koi notice nahin diya gaya
 The reason given for sealing was that Prem Singh is doing dairy work at home and it comes in commercial activity
 hairaani kii baat thi ki 'ajtak' kii team ne jab gali kaa daura kiya to paaya ki jis makaan ko sil kiya gaya tha usase 10 kadam dur hi 2 factory chal rahi hai, magar vahaan aisi kisi bhi tarah kii karrwai nahin hui
 The successful and rich legacy of the family, the big organization, the army of warlords and the hard work also could not reach Congress President Rahul Gandhi to the point of politics where many people of gandhi-nehru family not only reached before him, but remained for a long time
 are
 congress adhyaksh ke taur par unke kareeb 20 maheene ke safar main madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan ke chunavi jeet ke taur par badi safaltaaen mili, lekin is saal ke loksabhaa chunaav main party kii karaari haar unki naakaami kii badi ibaarat likh gaya or isi ke saath party ke mukhiya ke taur par unki pari kaa patakshep bhi ho gaya
 While president, Gandhi attempted to change the work culture of the party
 unhone tikat aavanton, sanghathan kii kaaryastylee main paardarshita laane ke liye kadam uthaaya tathaa sanghathan main chunaav karaane kii parampara shuru kii
 Rahul, son of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and former Congress president Sonia Gandhi, caught the attention of the media, public and intellectual class from the beginning of his political innings and first became the party's National Vice President and then became the Congress President at the time of Gujarat elections in December 2017
 
 gujarat ke chunaav main congress bhale hi maamuli antar se haar gai, lekin kai siyaasi jaankaron ne gandhi ke netritv or party kii chunavi ranneeti kii tarif kii
 After Gandhi became the president, the Congress lost in the Karnataka assembly elections in 2018, then the Congress victory in the assembly elections of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan held at the end of 2018 served to boost the confidence of the party workers under his leadership
 in teen hindi bhashi rajyon main jeet se utsahit congress or gandhi ko laga ki 2019 ke chunaav main centre kii satta main bhi vaapasi hogi, lekin pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv bhaajapa kii badi jeet ne unki ummiido par pani pher diya
 Also, his defeat in his traditional Amethi seat brought him a double blow
 loksabhaa chunaav main mukhya vipakshi party ke niraashajanak pradarshan kii sthiti yah he ki vah 2014 ke apane 44 siton ke aankadon main mahaj kuch siton kii badhotaree kar pai or use 52 siten mili
 Before the election and also during the election, many experts said that if the Congress scores a century on seats, it will be a comfortable situation for him and party president Rahul Gandhi, although this does not seem to be happening
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke netritv main samoochee party ne prachaar abhiyaan pradhanmantri modi par kendrit rakhaa or rafel vimaan saude main bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaate hue ‘chaukeedaar chor he' kaa prachaar abhiyaan chalaaya jiske jawaab main modi or bhaajapa ne ‘main bhi chaukeedaar' abhiyaan shuru kiya
 Rahul Gandhi introduced the 'minimum income guarantee' (justice) scheme as a masterstroke, apart from the Rafale issue
 party ko ummid thi ki garibon ko salanaa 72 hajaar rupee dene kaa uskaa vaada bhaajapa ke rashtrawaad vaale vimarsh kii dhar ko kund kar degaa, jabaki hakeekat main aisa nahin hua
 Experts believe that with the Congress's 'negative' campaigning, the lack of clear leadership from either the party or the opposition coalition was overshadowed
 party ke prachaar abhiyaan kii kaman sambhalate hue gandhi pradhanmantri pad athwa vipaksh kii taraf se netritv ke sawaal ko bhi pratyaksh athwa paroksh rup se taalte rahe
 He kept saying repeatedly that the public is the boss and his decision will be accepted
 loksabhaa chunaav main congress kii karaari haar ke baad 25 may ko hui seedblusi kii baithak main rahul gandhi ne party ke adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya tha
 Rejecting his resignation at the time, the CWC authorized him to make a radical change in the party, although Gandhi remained firm on his stand and made it clear that neither he nor any other member of the Gandhi family would take over
 vaise, gandhi ne yah bhi kaha he ki vah adhyaksh nahin rahete hue bhi party ke liye sakriyata se kaam karte rahenge
 Sachin Tendulkar also expressed disappointment like every fan as the Indian team dropped out of the Twenty20 World Cup early but completely disagreed with the performance at home and other strong reactions
 tendulkar ne kaha ki unhen niraashaa he ki bharat apane khitaab kaa bachaav nahin kar paaya lekin iske saath unka maananaa he ki swadesh main prashansakon kii pratikriya(jimmedaarana or santulit)honi chahie
 Tendulkar said, "I believe that when people react, emotions prevail over them
" lekin kya is tarah kii pratikriyaaon se hamen behatar pradarshan karne main madad milegi
 Not at all
 isse vastav main khilaadiyon par adhik dabaav badhata he
 We should support the team by showing maturity
 unhone bharat ke ek nijee channel se kaha ki jo biit gaya use koi bhi nahin badal saktaa lekin hameshaa isse sabak lekar bhavishya main acha pradarshan kiya ja saktaa he
 Our response to both success and failure should be more responsible and balanced
 aisa karne se prayek ke liye aasaani hogi

 The French media has questioned the ongoing Rafale 'ghotala' controversy in India, comparing it to the Bofors scandal in the 1980s
 franceke pramukh akhbaar france 24 ne kaha he ki aakhir kaise 2007 main shuru hui deal se 2015 main hindustan aronutics limited (HAL) ko baahar karte hue nijee kshetra kii reliance dephence ko shaamil kiya gaya?france 24 ne likhaa he ki rafel deal kii shuruyaat 2007 main tab hui jab bhartiya raksha mantralay ne 2007 main apana sabase bada tender jari karte hue 126 multi role ladaaku vimaan kharidne kii pahal kii
 This purchase of the Ministry of Defense became necessary because the Russian aircraft used in the country at that time were outdated and were not able to meet the defense challenges
 manmohan singh kii dilisi kram main 5 saal tak chali baatcheet ke baad manmohan singh ke netritv vaali congress sarkaar ne elaan kiya ki francisi company dasolt raksha mantralay ke tender main vijayi hua he
 Dassault manufactures Rafale and according to this 2012 agreement, the Ministry of Defense will purchase 18 Rafale fighter jets from the French company for immediate deployment to service
 vahiin bache hue 108 ladaaku vimaanon kii assembly dasolt bharat sarkaar kii company hindustan aronutics limited ke saath milakar bharat main karegaa
 Read this: Who is misleading Rafael? Rahul, Macron, who is wrong in Nirmala? According to France 24, at the time of this deal, India believed that this deal would increase the modern production capacity of HAL, the aerospace and defense company of the Government of India and to make fighter aircraft for the country
 Will be ready france 24 ke mutabik congress sarkaar kii yah deal keemat or kshamta par vivaad ke chalate agle teen saal tak ataki rahi
 Where initially the deal was just $ 12 billion, it increased to $ 20 billion
 keemat main ijapha is aadhaar par hua ki bharat sarkaar kii koshish kuch ladaaku vimaanon ko bharat main hi nirmit karaane kii thi
 Twist in Narendra Modi's deal and deal, there was a change of power in India in May 2014 and BJP government was formed under the leadership of Narendra Modi
 apane kaarykaal ke pehle varsh ke ant main pradhanmantri modi france ke daure par gaye or francisi companiyon ko mek in india kaarykram ke tahat bharat ke saath qaraar karne kaa nimantran diya
 Modi extended this invitation to French companies in the fields of civil nuclear energy, defense and food processing
 apane isi daure par pradhanmantri modi ne paris se deal kaa elaan kiya
 However, according to the new deal, now India had to buy only 36 fighter aircraft
 lihaaja puri deal par sarkaar ko sirf 8
 7 billion dollars to spend
 khasbaat yah thi ki sabhi ke sabhi 36 ladaaku vimaanon ko france main hi nirmit kiya jayega or taiyaar vimaan bharat ko saunpe jaaenge
 Disputed Parties of the New Deal In addition to this deal, an agreement was reached between the Government of India and France that the company would have to invest a certain way back to India in half of the total revenue earned by Dassault from this deal
 deal ke is paksh ko ofaset cloj kaha gaya
 So, under the deal, Dassault had to make sure that he was 8
 7 billian dollar kii aadhi rakam ko waapas bharat ke raksha kshetra main nivesh kare
 HAL Outside and Ambani in
 24 Its report says that a significant change in the deal was surprising
 bharat main echeel ke paas raksha kshetra main manuphaccharing kaa 78 saal kaa tajurba tha or vah is ofaset cloj main ek maatr company thi jiske paksh main faisla kiya jaataa
 But Dassault broke the agreement with HAL and tied up with Anil Ambani's Reliance Group
 khasbaat yah he ki is vakt tak reliance ke paas raksha kshetra kii manuphaccharing to dur use aviation sector kaa bhi koi tajurba nahin tha
 Read this: EXCLUSIVE: India Today discovers Nirav Modi's London location, writes for Anil Ambani, head of France 24 Reliance Group, that his history is full of controversies

 Apart from this, Anil Ambani's venture in the telecom sector went into a loss and his company was in debt of thousands of crores which he had to sell his telecom business to elder brother Mukesh Ambani to recover
 vahiin telecom spectrum ghotaale main bhi anil ambani kii bhoomika sandigdh rahi
 The company formed 15 days before the deal? France 24 claimed that Rahul Gandhi, the Leader of the Opposition in India, in an interview to another French newspaper raised the question on what basis the exclusion of a veteran company from this deal The company was given space that never worked in the region
 iske saath hi france 24 ne daawa kiya ki dasolt ne jis bhartiya company ko echeel kii apeksha tarjeeh di us company ko is deal se mahaj 15 din pehle hi sthapit kiya gaya
 The special thing is that this date for setting up the company is just 13 days before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to France
 vahiin france 24 ne yah bhi mudda uthaaya he ki pradhanmantri kii is yatra main shaamil kaarobaariyon ne anil ambani bhi maujuud the
 France 24 wrote that under the current situation it is clear that the Rafale Deal can play the same role in the upcoming general elections in India as the Bofors Deal did in the 1980s
 gauratlab he ki boforce deal par vivaad ke chalate rajeev gandhi ke netritv vaali congress sarkaar ko satta se baahar janaa padaa tha vahiin is baar nishane par bijepi sarkaar he
 The Delhi High Court dismissed the petition seeking a ban on the imposition of triple talaq on Hindu women marrying Muslims

 yani yah sankhya 2004 main use mili 184 siton ke mukaable kam hi he
 The only advantage is the Pandora's clan formed from the Third Front and the 'others', whose shape and form varies from minor to even jerky in the two larger alliances
 har baar chunaavon kii ghoshnaa hone ke baad nae sambandhon kii atmiyata kaa avishkaar karne vaale is gut ne apni talika main jabardast ijapha kiya he
 The number of possible seats it can get is between 169 and 178 against the 125 seats it won in 2004, which puts it virtually close to the NDA
 yah sthiti mahaj do saal pehle kii tulana main ekadam badali hui he
 The India today-org-marg national public opinion survey in January 2007 showed a significant improvement in UPA seats compared to 2004
 tab use 40
 It was expected to get 2 percent votes and 270 seats
 1999 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv vaale rajg ke 41
 No party or coalition has crossed the 38 percent vote share after winning 7 seats with 7 percent votes
 do saal pehle ke isi surveykshan ne 'tisare morche or anya' ko kul voton kaa 25
 9 percent and 115 seats were given
 surveykshan main rajg ko haalanki 33
 9 per cent of the votes were received, but its seat count was reduced to 155
 vidambnaa yah he ki naveenatam surveykshan main rajg kii siton main 20-30 kaa ijapha ho rahaa he, jabaki use praapt maton main 4 fisadi kami ho rahi he
 But the UPA is losing both seats and vote share
 2007 main use mili maton ke mukaable is baar use 5
 It is expected to get 9 percent less votes
 udhar, tisare morche or anya ko donon hi tarah kaa phayda ho rahaa he
 9 in positive votes in his favor
 9 fisadi vruddhi hui he
 It is also clear from the survey that the days of uniform inclination are now over
 bijd ke saath chhodane or dakshin main mahatvapurn tamilnadu main koi sahyogi na hone se purv or dakshin main bhaajapa ko khaasaa nuksaan hua he, haalanki uttar or pashchim main use thodaa laabh pahunchaa he
 The UPA has suffered everywhere
 use dakshin main 7
 13 per cent and 0 in the west
 06 fisadi kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 The tilt in favor of the Third Front is due to the gains in the south and east, which compensate for the minor losses of the north and west
 surveykshan se kuch aashcharya or kuch bahut hi sambhavya parinaam saamne aae hai
 For the first time in 11 years, Manmohan Singh has been considered the most suitable candidate for the post of Prime Minister, replacing Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 farvari 2008 ke hamaare surveykshan main jo vaajapeyi ke satta se hatane or vastutah surkhiyon se gaayab hone ke baad kiya gaya tha, ve sonia gandhi or manmohan singh samet apane pratidwandviyon se kahin dur aage the
 Manmohan Singh is ahead of Sonia Gandhi, who got 15 percent of the vote, getting 18 percent of the vote for the first time, Vajpayee is third and ahead of his own party's Prime Minister-in-waiting LK Advani, who got 12 percent of the vote
 teen main se har duusare bhartiya kaa ab bhi maananaa he ki sonia manmohan singh kii gaddi ke peeche kii takat bani hui hai, to 57 fisadi matadaata maanate hai ki upie ne saajha nunatam kaarykram ke mutabik vaade puure nahin kiye hai
 43 per cent of the voters feel that if Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi is projected as the prime ministerial candidate in the next elections, then BJP can get a lot of benefit
 surveykshan yah bhi bataata he ki manmohan singh ne pichley saal jab america ke purv raashtrapati jorge bush se washington main kaha tha ki bhartiya log americanyon se prem karte hai to ve satya ke saath khilwaad kar rahe the
 When asked if India should have close ties with the US, 64 per cent of the people answered negatively
 phir bhi is tathy ko nakaara nahin ja saktaa ki nai dilli main america ke duutavas or mahanagaron main iske vaanijya duutavaason ke saamne visa ke liye lagi lambii kataren shaayad yahi sabit karti hai ki log hameshaa us tarah matdaan nahin karte, jis tarah ve kehete hai
 Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin believes that Mahendra Singh Dhoni's superb batting form is also reflected in his captaincy, with the help of which India managed to win the first Test against Australia by performing brilliantly
 aswin ne shanivaar se shuru hone vaale duusare cricket test se pehle kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki match ke baad unhone khud kaha tha ki unhen bharosa nahin he ki vah is pradarshan ko doharaa paaenge
 i mean to say that he scored a double century in almost two seasons which is extraordinary
 ’aswin ne kaha, ‘unhone (dhoni) captain ke rup main match par shikanja ksaa or unke pradarshan kaa asar maidan par kshetrarakshakon kii sajaavat or gendbaaji badlaav main bhi dikhaa
 Tamil Nadu spin bowler Ashwin also played a key role in India's victory by taking 12 wickets in the first Test, with this performance, Ashwin has also lost his form, which is very important for India
 spinneron ke bich pratispardhaa ke bare main poochne par aswin ne kaha, ‘pratispardhaa hameshaa maujuud rahati he, yah ab bhi he or jari rahegi
 i do not think about it
 ye aap (media se jude log) log hai jo tulana karte ho isliye main ise lekar pareshaan kyon houn

 After the Congress President Rahul Gandhi objected to the nomination papers filled in the Amethi parliamentary seat for his name, now the nomination of BJP candidate Smriti Irani has also been raised
 rahul gandhi ke naam par aapatti ke baad scrootni ab 22 april ko hogi
 While the nomination of Smriti Irani, Independent candidate Rohit Kumar has objected to the Returning Officer through his advocate Rahul Chandani
 is ghatnakram ke baad bijepi ne rahul gandhi par nishaanaa saadhaa, saath hi unki shaikshanik yogyata or naagarikta par sawaal uthaate hue poocha ki kya vah kabhi british naagarik the or unhone ek saal ke antar main bie or emphil kii degree kaise hasil kar lee
 At the returning office of Amethi parliamentary constituency, on Saturday, the name of Rahul Gandhi was called as soon as the scrutiny started, after which four people objected to it
 aapatti ke baad rahul gandhi ke vakil rahul kowshik ne in akshepon kaa khandan karne ke liye samay maanga
 After which the returning officer extended the date of scrutiny to 22 April
 riterning officer ram manohar mishra ne is sambandh main ek patr jari kar isaki jaankaree di
 Objection was filed on behalf of these four people, one after the other on Afzal, Suresh Chandra, Dhruvlal and Suresh Kumar respectively, on Rahul Gandhi's name
 ab in aapattiyon par sunwaayee somvaar ko hogi
 So on the nomination of BJP candidate Smriti Irani, the nominee Rohit Kumar has objected to the election officer through his advocate Rahul Chandani
 rahul chandani ne kaha ki jab 2004 main unhone chandani chowk se chunaav ladaa to apane halafname main sirf or sirf bachaler of arts 1996 main khatm kar chuki hum likhaa, or unhone kisi or degree ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin di
 The affidavit given against Rahul Gandhi in 2014 from Amethi was different from the 2019 affidavit
 chandani ne smriti irani ke halafname main galat jaankaree dene kaa aarope lagaate hue nirvachan adhikari se shikaayat karte hue maang kii ki unka namakan radd kiya jaae
 In her affidavit for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Smriti had reportedly said that she graduated from the university in 1994
 unke kiye is daawey kii satyata par vipakshi dalon ne sawaal uthaate hue unke graduate na hone kii baat kahi thi
 The objections on Rahul Gandhi's name were sought by the BJP, who questioned the name and educational qualification of Jawaharrahul Gandhi, and also alleged that Rahul changed the certificates in every election
 bijepi ke pravaktaa jiviel narsimha raav ne kaha ki aaj puraa desh us samay stabdh rah gaya jab amethi main rahul gandhi ke namakan kii prakriya shuru kii gai or unka naam pukaare jane par kuch logon kii aapatti kiye jane ke baad rahul or unke vakil rahul kowshik spashtikaran dene ke liye taiyaar nahin the
 BJP spokesperson said that this is a shocking incident on Rahul Gandhi's citizenship
 unase yah sawaal poocha janaa chahie ki kya vah kabhi british naagarik the
 In the 2004 affidavit, Rahul Gandhi stated that he had not invested in an England company, while in 2005, according to documents from the company (backops Ltd), Rahul Gandhi was declared a British citizen
 kya yah bhartiya naagarikta kanoon kaa ulanghan nahin he
 If someone takes citizenship of another country, his Indian citizenship is lost
 shaikshanik yogyata par bhi sawaljiviel narsimha raav ne rahul kii shaikshanik yogyata par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki unki shiksha par kuch andeh ke badal mandara rahe hai

 On which statement of Naseer had created, Bwalanseer had said a few days ago that there is a bad atmosphere at this time

 narendra modi sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal kaa pehla aam bajet aaj aa rahaa he
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present this historic budget in Parliament at 11 am
 isse pehle guuruuvaar ko aarthik survey jari kiya gaya, jisamen modi sarkaar kii kamyaabiyon kii saraahna karte hue bhavishya kaa rodmap bhi bataaya gaya
 But there are many such things in the Economic Survey which have brought concern and challenges for the economic development of the country
 aarthik surveykshan ke mutabik, 2014 ke baad se ausat vikaas dar 7
 5%, but last year it decreased to 6
 8% rah gai he
 The Economic Survey has also estimated the country's economic growth rate to be 7% this year
 jabaki agar bharat ko 2024-25 tak 5 lakh karod dollar kii arthvyavastha bananaa he, to 8% kii vikaas dar kii jarurat hogi
 Chief Economic Advisor Krishnamurthy V
 subramanyam ne khud bataaya ki desh ko 5,000 arab dollar kii arthvyavastha banane ke lakshya ko hasil karne ke liye bharat ko agle paanch saal ke dauraan aath fisadi aarthik vikaas dar kii darkaar he
 He said that in view of this, emphasis has been laid on investment as a key driver in Economic Survey 2018-19
 ye bhi he chintaais sabake bich krishi kshetra ek badi chintaa kaa vishay he
 The slowness in the agriculture sector and the decline in the growth of the service sector is one of the important reasons for the non-growth rate
 iske alaava vittiya sansthaanon kii kharaab haalat bhi aarthik vikaas kii raftaar main badi rukaawat rahi he
 Explain that the rate of increase in loan amount from financial institutions has come down from 30% in March 2018 to 9% in March 2019
 isi kii vajah se arthvyavastha main nivesh kii dar bhi sabase nichle str par chal rahi he, jo saamaanya ausat se 19 se 20 fisadi kam he
 Apart from this, it is also difficult to raise capital from the market
 2018-19 main isamen 81 fisadi kii kami ai he
 Small companies in manufacturing are not able to grow enough even though they are 10–10 years old
 jabaki 100 se kam karmchaariyon vaali choti companiyon kii sankhya manuphaccharing kshetra main 50% se bhi zyada he
 The survey said that it is a real challenge to bring enough private investment across the country with the support of the public sector
 bhautik buniyadi dhaanche ke saath hi saamaajik buniyadi dhaanche kaa praavdhaan bhi utana hi mahatvapurn he, kyonki yah donon hi nirdhaarit karenge ki bharat ko 2030 main vishwastar par kis sthaan par rakhaa jayega
 In the midst of all these challenges, the country's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is going to present the budget
 aise main 5 trillian dollar iconomi kaa target paane ke liye lagaataar aath fisadi vikaas dar hasil karne ke liye na sirf sarkaar ko gear badalanaa hoga, balki nae vijan ke saath chunautiyon se bhi paar paanaa hoga

 congresvidhayakadwaramdhyapradeshke mukhyamantrishivraj singh chouhanaki tulana vaishya se karne vaale bayaan par raajnneeti garma gai he
 The Congress legislator once again, using the word Vaishya for CM, described the prostitutes as superior to CM Shivraj, on which the war of words in the BJP and Congress intensified on Monday
 bataa den ki reva jile ke gudh se congress ke vidhayak sundar laal tiwari ne kuch din pehle siem shivaraj singh chouhan ko vaishya kaha tha or shanivaar ko jab bhopal main patrakaron ke bich pahunche to phir se na keval apane bayaan par ad gaye balki vaishyaon ko shivaraj se behatar bataa diya
 In the press conference, the Congress MLA had also brought with him the dictionary, and seeing from the same dictionary, Tiwari told in which context he had called Shivraj as Vaishya
 dictionari kholkar usamen se padhate hue sunderlaal tiwari ne kaha ki "mujhe maaloom tha ki aap log ye sawaal puuchhenge isliye main apane saath dictionari lekar aayaa hum
 i am an MLA and a responsible man
 mujhe apane kahe kaa ratti bhar bhi afsos nahin he
 Prostitute in English means in Hindi "to put your qualities, abilities etc
 in a blasphemous work, this also means a prostitute" on the statement BJP has gone stubborn on this statement of Sundarlal Tiwari
 soobe ke rajyamantri vishwaas saarang ne iske liye congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se jawaab maanga he
 Vishwas Sarang has said that on objectionable rhetoric, the Congress excludes Mani Shankar Aiyar at the time of election and withdraws him after the election is over "sarang said that" a person without rites like Tiwari gets the strength
 Because the Congress withdraws even after making Mani Shankar Iyer a mistake ”
 saarang ne saaf kaha ki bijepi ise chunavi mudda banaaegi
 The Congress supported Tiwari's statement even though the BJP is furious over the Congress mla's statement, but the Congress supported Sundarlal Tiwari's statement, saying that the context in which Tiwari called CM Shiva Raj is not wrong
 pradesh congress kii media prabharee shobhaa ojha ne kaha ki "jahaan tak tiwari kaa bayaan he unhone jis pariprekshya main is baat ko kaha usamen kahin koi galati nahin he or hamane to bijepi ke netaaon dwaara media ko prestitute kehete dekha he
 Have seen CM Shivraj Singh speak so many wrong words for Scindia ji
 to bijepi kisi munh se kisi par ungali uthaa sakati he
 Let me tell you that Sunderlal Tiwari has already made a statement about Shivraj Singh Chauhan after which a lot of uproar took place and CM Shivraj himself responded to the statement, calling the prostitutes as someone's sister, mother and daughter to the Congress itself
