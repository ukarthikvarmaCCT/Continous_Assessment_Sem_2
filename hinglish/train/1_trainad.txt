 samay ke saath bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar par congress ke siyaasi hamalon kaa tikhaapan or ghanatv donon badhane vaala he
 The reason, with the beginning of October, the Congress decided and ordered all its top leaders not to let a single blow of Modi go blank
 wo do maaren to tum chaar maaro
 The attack was also aimed at keeping Modi confined as the regional leader of Gujarat, and with every bet, there would be mention of riots
 so chidambaram ke haalia hamale to bas is primetime sop opera kii agali kadi bhar he
 Chidambaram did not confine his statements to embarrass Modi less than atal-advani, but said in a cautious tone that there is no influence of Modi outside the urban youth, so the Congress has no threat from Modi in 2014
 modi kaa trek record daagdar he
 However, Chidambaram's sparks were extinguished by BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain by midnight
 ajtak se khaas baatcheet main shahanvaaj ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ne saream press conference kar pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko to kahin kaa choda nahin, lihaaja chidambaram congress main ab apana kad badhaane ke liye narendra modi par sidhe hamale kar rahe hai
 On Chidambaram's demand for a debate in regional languages, Shahnawaz said that if there is any strength in the Congress, then Rahul Gandhi should be pitched against Narendra Modi
 chidambaram hindi ke khilaaf hai isliye hindi ke alaava duusari bhashaaon main bahes karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 In Parliament, there are locks on the tongues of Congress leaders and outside they beat the debate
 kul milakar chidambaram ke bayanon se ek baat bilkul saaf he ki modi ke treetment ko lekar party main uhapoh kii sthiti ab khatm ho chuki he
 The party has come out of this period of internal duel to target Modi in his statements or the entire BJP and its style of functioning

 Not reading the question paper well: Students are given 15 minutes to read the question paper
 us samay students prashn patr padhane ke bajaay sawaal hal karne lag jate hai
 So that they solve more questions and waste their time in the section where they have to do less questions without reading
 isliye students ko prashn patr achche se padhanaa chahie
 Time Management: Students should take time management in the exam
 aksar student time management karke nahin chalate or unka paper rah jaataa he
 Students should do time management in such a way that the section which is of higher marks should be finished first and then try to solve the section with less number
 galat data copy karnaa:newmerical sawaal hal karte samay student aksar prashn patr main se dekhakar galat sankhya likh lete hai
 Because of which the question becomes wrong, so be careful while taking the question and check the data once again
 point main ansar naa likhnaa:students ko saaf sudhari ejaminner friendli ansar shit taiyaar kerani chahie
 Often students write the answer in large paragraphs, which makes it difficult for the examiner to check
 jahaan tak ho sake students ko apni baat points main likhni chahie

 com / y1r90ljfji— وزارة الخارجية 🇸🇦 (@KSAMOFA) September 26, 2017 The Saudi Foreign Ministry announced this on Twitter about the new order
 unhone likhaa, 'saudi arab ne mahilaon drive karne kii anumati de di he
 'this order will be implemented from 23 or 24 June next year according to the Islamic calendar
 saudi arab kii ginati kattarpanthi desh ke taur par hoti he, jahaan mahilaon ke liye paabandiyaan bahut zyada or sakht hai
 At the same time, this order is a step in relation to the development and modern decisions, which are being seen in Saudi Arabia
 saudi ke shaasha salmaan ke is kadam kaa america ne bhi swaagat kiya he
 a US State Department spokesman said, "this is a big step to take Saudi Arabia in the right direction
" 'shanivaar ko saudi arab ne apane foundation de main pehali baar mahilaon ko stadium main ho rahe concert main entry di thi
 That decision was also highly appreciated
 aise main yah saare faisle saudi sarkaar ke vijan 2030 kaa hissaa hai
 Now Saudi Arabia is trying to relax these restrictions and regulations under the Social and Economic Reform for Vision 2030 aaj ghar ke sadasyon kii neend khulegi film 'lagaan' ke mitawa gane se
 The theme of the day will also be decided by this
 ghar ke sadsy baat karenge ki us samay unka dil kaise dhak se rah gaya tha jab prince ne kaha ki unhone apane saamaan ke liye 30 lakh ru
 Has spoken
 iske badabig boski lagaan task kii ghoshnaa hogi, jisamen aman or kishwar ko jameendaar banaaya jayega jabaki arvind vegada is task ke suparvizer honge,gharake baaki sadasyon ko workars kii bhoomika saunpi jaaegi
 Except the garden area, the houseworkers will be driven from all the corners of the house and they will be assembled in one place
 jitani baar bhi ve pratibandhit jagahon par jaaenge jameendaar ko har tex main katautee kerani hogi
 According to the task, workers would have to grind flour in pairs and put it in packets and try to sell it to landlords
 vijeta is aadhaar par tay kiya jayega ki kiske paas sabase zyada sikke honge
 Zamindars will be against the workers and they will be able to fix the tax rate according to themselves
 jaise hi workars ko pataa chalegaa ki yah kaam jameendaaron ke haq main he to ve turant hi ranneeti bana lenge
 With this, the entire atmosphere in the house will change and all the equations will be completely different
 jahaan mandana or kith ke matbhed sabake saamne aa jaaenge vahiroshelaur vikaas ke bich nai pareshaaniyaan bhi paidaa ho jaaengi
 Stress can also be seen in development and tempering
 roshelle or mandanaek saath aa jaaengi or kahengi ki vikaas kii samasya purushon vaala ahm he jabaki vikaas kii partner yuvika itani mehnat kii vajah se behosh ho jaaegi
 Then Rachel will be seen telling Keith how she too wants to become the captain of the house, but Rimi is becoming an obstacle for her
 big boski ghoshnaa hogi ki ghar kii jodiyaan niyamon ko tod rahi he vajah english bolnaa he
 On the other hand, Vikas will get angry with Digangana as to why he has not worn the mic
 udhar task ke dauraan real life kapal suyash or kishwar ke bich talavaarein khinch jaaengi kyonki suyash task ke dauraan kishwar ko fansaane kii koshish karte hai
 Hartalika Teej is one of the major vows of Suhagin women
 yah vrath pati kii lambii umr or mangal kaamana ke liye rakhaa jaataa he
 During this, the women worship Mata Gauri and Lord Bhole Nath by keeping a fast on Nirjala
 hindu panchang ke anusaar yah vrath har saal bhado maah kii shukla paksh tritiya ko aata he
 But this time, like Janmashtami, there has been confusion about the date of Hartalika Teej 2019
 mahilaon ko samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki aakhir kis din haratalika teej kaa vrath rakhaa janaa chahie
 Some people are saying that the fast will be on 1 September, while some people are advising to keep the fast on 2 September
 pedo par jhule sawan kii phuhaar, mubarak ho aapako haratalika teej kaa tyohaar, in miseges se den badhainghanesh Chaturthi 2019: 2 sitambar ko he ganesh chaturthi, jaaniye shubh muhoort, puja vidhi, vrath katha or mahatvawartlik Teej 2019: jaaniye haratalika teej kii tithi, shubh muhoort, puja vidhi, vrath katha or mahatvatark yah bhi he ki hast nakshatra main teej kaa paaran nahin karnaa chahie
 Those women who observe fast on September 1, they will have to fast in the morning constellation in the early morning on September 2, which is wrong
 vahiin agar mahilaayein 2 sitambar ko vrath karen to ve 3 sitambar ko chitra nakshatra main vrath kaa paaran karengi
 In the Puranas, observing fast in Chitra Nakshatra is considered auspicious and auspicious
 baharhaal, ham aapako yahi salaah denge ki agar aap haratalika teej kaa vrath rakhane kii soch rahi hai to pehle apane pandit ji yaa jyotishi se tith ko lekar vichaar-vimarsh jarur kar len

 However, the Supreme Court has also raised many questions on the government and said that first the government should satisfy the court that the new system is better and transparent than the collegium
 sunwaayee guuruuvaar ko bhi jari rahegi

 varjeenia equarium and marine science centre ne bataaya- ''octopus main chromatophers hote hai jo rang badalane main madad karte hai
 It seems that someone has opened fire on them as soon as they come out of the eggs

 Amit Shah, who is believed to be Modi's confidant after JD (U) parted ways with the BJP to make Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi the head of the Election Campaign Committee, will visit Patna on September 21 to sense the electoral atmosphere in Bihar
 bhaajapa ke anusuchit jati morcha ke adhyaksh sanjay paswan ne bataaya ki bihar ke purv mukhyamantri bholaa paswan shastri kii 100veen jayanti ke avasar par patna main aagaamee 21 sitambar ko yojit hone vaale ek kaarykram main shah bhaag lenge
 Sanjay said that during his visit, Shah will also review the electoral atmosphere of Bihar to chalk out a strategy for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 bhaajapa mahasachiv or narendra modi ke mantrimandal main shaamil shah patna main aagaamee 27 aktubar ko bhaajapa dwaara yojit hone vaali ‘hunkaar raily’ jise modi sambodhit karne vaale hai kii taiyaari kaa bhi jayja lenge
 The importance of this rally has increased as Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has consistently opposed Modi's candidature for the post of Prime Minister
 nitish ke virodh ke kaaran bhaajapa ne varsh 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav or varsh 2010 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaav main rajg ke ummidavaaron ke paksh main prachaar ke liye modi ko yahaan bulaane se parhez kiya tha
 The Shiv Sena has finally succumbed to the BJP on the issue of alliance in Maharashtra
 shivasena ne sarkaar gathan ke mudde par bijepi ko samarthan kaa elaan kar diya he
 The party has said that if BJP is made the chief minister, it will support it
 haalanki party ne kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ko apni pasand bataaya he
 In the party mouthpiece 'saamana', Uddhav Thackeray has written that he is ready to support BJP for the betterment of Maharashtra
 uddhav ne likhaa, 'janata ke aashirwad kaa 'sona' kar maharashtra kaa rath aage le jane vaala koi bhi hone do, shivasena himmat or hikmat se uskaa saath degi
 These days, an attempt is being made to discredit the Shiv Sena by spreading false news
 jo log aisa kar rahe hai unki khushi kshanbhangur sabit hogi
 'significantly, after the' Tea Party 'of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi on Sunday, Shiv Sena's attitude softened
 centre main shivasena cote ke mantri anant geete ne kaha tha ki janata ne donon dalon ko saath kaam karne kaa janadesh diya he
 He had said that he would continue to be a minister at the Center
 iske agle hi din 'saamana' main uddhav ne yah sampadakeey likhaa he
 Shiv Sena happy with bjp's success! In the 'saamana' published on Monday morning, Shiv Sena's notes about BJP were changed
 chunaav se pehle bijepi ko'shraadh ke kauwe'bataane vaali party ne kaha ki bijepi ko safalataa milane se unhen khushi he
 Uddhav wrote in a newspaper editorial, 'we enjoy the bjp's good success
 congress-rashtravaadi ke ghotalebaajon ko satta milane ke bajaay bhaajapa ko mil rahi he, yah rajya ke hit main he
 "credit to Modi and Shah for victory" Udhav has credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah instead of giving credit to BJP leaders for the victory of the BJP
 mukhyamantri ke mudde par uddhav ne likhaa, 'mukhyamantri pad ko lekar kai naam saamne aa rahe hai
 But the final decision will be taken by Narendra Modi and Amit Shah
 maharashtra main bijepi kii siten badhin to iskaa shrey modi or shah ko jaataa he
 "experience near Gadkari" Udhav wrote that Shiv Sena never made any distinction between Hindus
 lekin 'vishisht samaaj' ke ilaakon main jis tarah kaa matdaan hua vah chintaa ke bajaay chintan kaa vishay he
 He wrote, 'the names of Gadkari, Fadnavis, Javadekar, Tawde, Khadse and Pankaja Munde are going on regarding the Chief Minister
 lekin gadakari or fadanvis ke bich hi muqabla he
 In considering today's experience and functionality, Gadkari topped this quality test
 vah maharashtra ko bhalee bhaanti jaanate hai or unke paas vikaas kaa vijan he
 On the other hand, Fadnavis does not even have direct ministerial experience
 ' India reached the final of the Commonwealth Games Men's Hockey for the first time after beating England 5-4 in a penalty shoot-out on Tuesday in the semi-final to reach the thrill of the thrill, where they will face World Champion Australia
 khachaakhach bhare stadium main darshakon or khilaadiyon main vahi josh tha jo pakistan ke khilaaf aakhri lig match main dekhne ko mila tha
 After trailing by two goals, India made a spectacular comeback and pulled the match to extra time
 usamen bhi score 3-3 se baraabar rahane ke baad faisla penlti shoot out par chalaa gaya
 In this, Sarwanjeet Singh, Vikram Pillai, Sandeep Singh, Arjun Halappa and Shivendra Singh scored goals for India
 vahiin, england ke liye richard smith, richard mental, ashley jaikson or simon mental ne sahi nishaanaa lagaaya, jabaki glen kirakham kaa shaat bharat chhetri ne bachaa liya
 The whole ground was agitated as soon as the seal of victory in the Commonwealth Games in the men's hockey was untouched by the medal
 darshakon kii taaliyon kii gadgadahaten lambey samay tak nahin rukeen
 Indian hockey fans rarely see such a view
 ab final main bharat 14 aktubar ko austrailia se bhidega jisane newjiland ko 6-2 se haraaya
 Earlier the trailing Indian team made a brilliant comeback with two goals in four minutes
 bharat ke liye sarvanajit singh (19waan or 61waan minute) or vikram pillai (57waan minute) ne gol kiye jabaki england ke liye draig flikar ashley jaikson (35waan or 41waan minute) or simon mental (45waan minute) ne gol daage
 The match was dragged into extra time after the score was reduced to 3-3 by the time scheduled
 bharat ko 78wein minute main penlti carnor mila lekin sandip singh kaa nishaanaa chook gaya
 Two minutes later, Tushar Khandekar missed an easy opportunity right in front of the goal
 agle minute main captain raajapaal singh se mili cross par vah phir sahi nishaanaa lagane se chuke
 No team could score a goal in extra time
 pehle half main bharatiyon ne dabadabaa banaaye rakhaa
 India missed an easy chance in the opening moments when Shivendra could not catch the ball in front of goal
 bharat ke liye pehla gol 19wein minute main sarvanajit singh ne kiya
 The first penalty corner was flicked by Dhananjay Mahadik after trying a variation but England goalkeeper James Fair saved it
 carnor ke liye push dene vaale sarvanajit ne goalpost ke paas se gend ko bheetar daal diya
 Three minutes later, England lost a very easy chance to equalize
 raab mure kaa hit goalpost ke paas se gujara lekin vahiin khadey richard mental furti se gend ko stick se chhukar gol kii taraf nahin bhej sake
 England, however, did not allow India to create psychological pressure by scoring an equalizer in the last minute in the first half
 anbhavi draig flikar jaikson ne yah gol kiya
 England looked more aggressive in the second half and got the advantage in the 41st minute in the form of a penalty corner which was converted by Jackson to give England the lead
 badhat banane ke baad bhi england ne jabardast aakraamak haaki khelnaa jari rakhaa
 England showed a superb variation, scoring a third goal in the 45th minute on a penalty corner
 gend ko rokkar duusare khilaadi ko saunpa gaya jisane mental ko paas diya
 Indian goalkeeper Bharat Chhetri could not save his stormy shot
 england ko teen minute baad ek or penlti carnor mila or is baar chhetri ne koi chook nahin kii
 In the second half, India got their first penalty corner in the 55th minute, but experienced drag flicker Sandeep Singh missed the target
 iske do minute baad hi haalanki sandip ne bharat ke duusare gol main sutaradhar kii bhoomika nibhaate hue daahine flank se lanbaa paas diya jise vikram ne gol kii taraf diflact kiya
 India scored the second goal within four minutes and agitated the huge crowd gathered at the stadium
 english dephence main send maarthe hue bhartiya farward khilaadiyon ne behtareen move banaaya
 Captain Rajpal Singh missed the goalpost but Sarvanjeet made no mistake from near the left post

 He suffered a wrist injury while preparing for the home match, due to which he has been ruled out of the first Test match

 There is also doubt about his playing in the second Test in Hamilton

 The cadres of both the parties used to mention only their respective seats in the talks
 jab yah baat bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ko maaloom hui to unhone fouran mukhyamantri devendra fadavis se kaha ki ve khud is maamle ko dekhen or bhaajapa tathaa shivasena ke cader kii jagah endie cader taiyaar karen tathaa pradhanmantri narendra modi ko rashtriya str par endie kaa ekmaatr cheharaa banaae rakhen
 Fadnavis persuaded Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray that Shiv Sena cadres should work on the ground as per bjp's strategy
 yahi vah badi vajah rahi jisane maharashtra main endie ko 48 main se 41 loksabhaa siton par jeet dilaai
 Pandey and Fadnavis contributed immensely in bringing the bjp's strategy to the ground
 ranneeti main chook kii jiro tolerance niti ne rajya main bhaajapa ke khilaaf satta virdohi rujhaan, kisaanon kii pareshaani or dalit andolan se upje aakrosh kaa laabh virdohi gathbandhan (ensipi-congress) ko nahin uthaane diya
 Of course, the way the anti-bjp parties came together before the elections, the BJP was on the backfoot in most states in terms of arithmetic (vote percentage)
 282 seat dobaaraa paanaa asambhav nahin to kathin jarur lag rahaa tha lekin, nattejey aae to bhaajapa ne apane pichley pradarshan se acha karte hue 303 siten hasil kar leen
 In Uttar Pradesh, the alliance of SP-BSP and RLD can be reversed
 sutron kaa kahana he ki party kii chintaa uttar pradesh ko lekar yah thi ki yahaan jeet tabhi mil sakati he jab sarkari yojanaon ke labhaarthiyon kaa saath mili or iske liye bina sidhe sampark kaa koi doosraa kargar vikalp nahin tha
 In such a situation, Govardhan Jhadapia, who is considered to be a master of organization skills and skilled in contact with the people, was sent as co-incharge in the state
 unhone labhaarthiyon ke saath hi aise logon ko bhi torget kiya jo bhavi labhaarthi ho sakate hai
 "in 2014, BJP got 43 percent of the vote," says Jhadapia
 lekin virdohi dalon ke gathbandhan kii sthiti main itane vot se kaam hone vaala nahin tha
 In such a situation, the party targeted 51 percent of the vote
 ham labhaarthiyon ke alaava anya logon se bhi sampark main rahe
 "A central level leader posted in the state says that the Narrative changed when 'who is compared to Modi' became the main issue of discussion among the people
" yah ek under curent sa chalaa or bhaajapa 62 seat jeetne main safal rahi
 This strategy of Amit Shah was successfully implemented by Govardhan Jhadapia and Sunil Bansal in the state
 padosi rajya bihar main bhaajapa 2014 main lojpa or ralospa ke saath mil kar ladi thi
 Nitish was contesting alone and together with RJD and Congress
 bhaajapa 23 seat jeetne main safal rahi thi
 But the BJP suffered a major defeat in 2015 assembly elections with the Congress, JD (U) and RJD
 2019 main bina nitish ke bhaajapa ko jeet kii ummid kam thi
 This was the reason that BJP gave 17 seats to JD (U) in Bihar
 pradesh bhaajapa ke upaadhyaksh devesh kumaar kehete hai ki maai sameekaran phir bhi majboot sthiti main tha
 But the Prime Minister's face was the most powerful in the party's success
 saath hi sanghathan ke rup main bhaajapa or jad (you) main shandaar talmail rahaa
 In every election meeting, the Prime Minister was placed at the centerpiece
 bhaajapa or jad (you) bihar kii janata ko yah baat samajhane main safal raheen
 This is the reason that NDA succeeded in winning 39 seats out of 40
 bengal or odisha main bhaajapa kaa koi khaas dakhal nahin rahaa he
 But this time the party exerted its full force in both these states
 2017 main jab odisha main bhaajapa kii maharashtra kaaryakarini kii baithak hui thi tab party adhyaksh amit shah ne saaf kar diya tha ki 2019 main in donon hi rajyon main bhaajapa badi safalataa hasil karegi
 The biggest problem faced by BJP general secretary and in-charge of Bengal Kailash Vijayvargiya was that the BJP did not have a strong leader at the state level in the state
 aise main chunaav jeetne main sakasham pratyaashee ke liye unhen duusare dalon ke logon ko tod kar party main shaamil karnaa tha
 He executed this strategy well
 tiemasi ke sansthaapak sadasyon main se ek or mamata ke kareebi rahe mukul raay ko bhaajapa main shaamil karaane main ve safal rahe
 Later Rai was also successful in executing the bjp's strategy in the state
 vijayawargeey jahaan rajya main alag-thalag pade vampanthi votaron ke tiemasi ko haraane ke liye bhaajapa ko vot dene kii ranneeti par kaam karte rahe, vahiin raay tiemasi ke prabhavi netaaon ko todakar bhaajapa main shaamil karaate rahe
 Vijayvargiya succeeded in making the elections in the state two-polar instead of triangular (TMC, Left and BJP) and BJP managed to win 18 out of 42 seats here
 2014 main bhaajapa yahaan sirf do seat hi jeet saki thi
 bjp's strategy in Odisha was embodied by party general secretary and in-charge of the state, Arun Singh
 odisha main loksabhaa ke saath hi vidhansabha chunaav bhi hue
 But Arun Singh did not let the assembly elections be the focus
 unhone sara dhyaan loksabhaa chunaav par rakhaa
 He properly introduced the bjp's strategy in the state under which the party propagated that the BJP is contesting elections to make Modi the Prime Minister
 modi ke mukaable ke liye bijd ke paas koi nahin he
 BJP won eight seats from here
 isse pehle 2014 main party ko sirf ek seat hi hasil hui thi
 bjp's in-charge Anil Jain fought the election of Chhattisgarh completely as a national election
 unhone is baat kaa puraa dhyaan rakhaa ki kisi bhi sthiti main bhaajapa ke kisi puraane chehre ke khilaaf maahaul nahin bane
 For this, he suggested to the national leadership not to give tickets to any old candidate this time
 chhattisgarh main na to kisi puraane saansad yaa uske rishtedaar ko tikat mil paaya, na hi purv mukhyamantri raman singh ko prachaar main pramukhataa di gai
 In Madhya Pradesh adjoining Chhattisgarh, the Congress was defeated in the assembly elections
 lekin bhaajapa ne pasa palat diya
 Former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan kept making sure that the PM Kisan Sequaman Fund gets to all farmers
 booth str ke kaaryakartaaon se ve lagaataar sampark main rahe
 The BJP in-charge of the state, Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, was successful in putting the electoral management on the ground and the BJP was able to win 28 out of 29 seats here
 ullekhneey he ki rajasthan main bhaajapa ne 25 main 25 siten jeet leen
 The election in-charge of this place Prakash Javadekar successfully implemented the strategy of helping Rajput and Meena voters
 gurjar bhi congress se is vajah se naaraaz chal rahe the ki sachin payalat ko siem nahin banaaya gaya
 Javadekar, Vasundhara Raje succeeded in persuading Scindia to abstain from campaigning
 sah prabharee sudhanshu trivedi media or seminar ke jariye modi sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon ko sateek tareeke se prabud logon tak pahunchaate rahe
 He handled the responsibility of coordination with the organization and the BJP was successful
 haryana main bhaajapa ne 10 main se 10 siten hasil kin
 In the last election, BJP could win only 7 out of 10 seats here
 bhaajapa ko yahaan badi safalataa dilaane main mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter or prabharee anil jain jameen par kaam kar rahe the

 England's strong opening move towards opener Alastair Cook's second double helped England to a 232-run lead on the second day of the third Test, putting India on the backfoot
 cook ne egebaston main duusare din kaa khel samaapt hone tak 182 ran banaaye hai jisase england teen wicket par 456 ran banaakar pehali pari main vishaal badhat hasil karne kii sthiti main pahunch gaya
 Cook has scored 26 fours in his innings, playing 339 balls
 stump ukhdane ke samay unke saath duusare chor par eon morgan do aasaan jeevandaan milane ke baad 44 ran par khel rahe hai
 The second day was also terrible for India, who were on the verge of losing the number one crown due to trailing 0-2 in the series
 bhartiya team kal 224 ran par simat gai thi jabaki england ne aaj kul milakar 372 ran banaaye or jabaki bhartiya gendbaajon ko is bich teen wicket hi mili
 He got one of these wickets at Nobel
 iske alaava teen aasaan kaich bhi chute
 Strauss (87) missed out on a century but a 186-run partnership for the first wicket between Cook and him laid a strong foundation for England
 iske baad unhone ian bel (34) ke saath 66 ran or kevin petersan (63) ke saath 122 ran kii saajhedaariyaan kii jabaki morgan ke saath vah abhi tak 82 ran jod chuke hai
 Leg-spinner Amit Mishra gave India the first success but only Praveen Kumar could leave an impact in the fast bowlers
 unhone ballebaajon ko pareshaan kiya tathaa bel or petersan ko pavilion bheja
 Ishant Sharma and s Sreesanth have bowled over 100 runs but did not get wickets
 bharat ko aakhir main 56wein over kii aakhri gend par vah bahupratikshit safalataa mili jisaki use kal shaam se talash thi
 Strauss tried to sweep Mishra's ball but he left his leg stump empty in this round
 gend unako gachha dekar leg stump par lagi or bharatiyon ko bhi iskaa pataa kuch der se chalaa
 Later TV replays showed that Mishra's front leg was ahead of the crease and it was Noble but by then Strauss had returned to the pavilion
 unhone apni pari main 176 gend kheli tathaa 13 chauke lagaae
 He has not scored a century in the last 14 innings
 pehle do test match main keval 20 ran banane vaale cook shuru main satarkta dikhaane ke baad acchhee lay main dikhe
 He completed his 19th century by taking one run off Praveen's ball
 iske liye unhone 213 gend kheli or 14 chauke lagaaye
 Bell, who scored a century in the last Test, also made a reliable start by hitting three fours in Ishant Sharma's over
 iske baad srisanth baahar jaati gend par unke balle kaa kinaaraa nikaalane main safal rahe
 Bell was on 30 at the time, but Rahul Dravid, who took the most catches in Tests, leaked a very easy catch in the first slip
 petersan ko shuru main praveen ne thodaa pareshaan kiya lekin vah jald hi apane aakraamak andaaj main aa gaye
 He also hit a six on long on Mishra
 bharat ne 80 over ke turant baad nayi gend lee lekin abhi isse bhi koi asar nahin padaa
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni handed Ishant a new ball but Pietersen hit three fours in his over and removed him from the attack
 chaay ke vishram ke baad petersan puri tarah se haaavee rahe
 Meanwhile, on Sreesanth's ball, India also resorted to DRS for a catch behind the wicket but the ball was then hit by the pad, not his bat and the decision of umpire Simon Taufel proved to be right
 aakhir main bel vaali kahani doharaai gai or jo wicket srisanth ko nahin mila use praveen ne apane naam likhvaya
 Pietersen remained unimpressed and kept scoring, but he missed a straight ball from Praveen and umpire Steve Davis lost his finger on the lbw appeal
 petersan ne apni pari main 78 gend kheli tathaa nau chauke or ek chakka lagaaya
 When new batsman Morgan hit Praveen for two fours, Dhoni gave the ball to Suresh Raina, who in the meantime had only four consecutive overs from the 17-over old ball
 is bich duusare chor par gendbaaji kaa jimmaa sambhaal rahe ishanth kii gend par srisanth ne morgan kaa kaich bhi choda jo tab 17 ran par khel rahe the
 After this, in the last over of the innings, Dravid dripped his easy catch in the slip

 The BJP was pleasantly surprised here in the Gujarat Municipal Corporation elections last month

 bhaajapa ke liye yah sab ek shagun sabit hua he
 He defended Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and said that many foreign governments have also changed their mind towards Gujarat government and Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 adwani ne kaha, ‘in sab baton ne mujhe yakeen dilaayaa he ki desh ke raajnneetik maahaul ko nirnaayak tareeke se congress se bhaajapa ke netritv vaale vikalp ke paksh main badla ja saktaa he
 For the return of the BJP to the power of the Center, he emphasized on the strategy of expanding the NDA and connecting more and more people
 unhone kaha ki iske liye sabase pehle hamen sushasan or vikaas kaa ek agenda teji se taiyaar karnaa hoga or doosraa bhaajapa ko is vishwaas ke saath apana drudh mat vyakt karnaa chahie ki ham bina kisi bhedbhaav ke samaan rup se samaaj ke prayek varg kii chintaa karte hai chaahe vah kisi bhi dharm or jati kaa ho

 The influence of the planet Venus will make the trailer of the film Tanaji famous and it will be discussed a lot

 This is due to the fly laying eggs there, after the eggs burst, insects emerge from them

 a former US ambassador has said that the Trump administration considers India a top priority of US foreign policy and the credit for the strong ties between the two countries goes to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former US President Barack Obama
 bharat main america ke purv rajdoot richard rahul verma ne kaha meraa maananaa he kitrump prashasan membharat ko america videsh niti kii ek badi praathamikta samajha jaataa he
 "the overall path of relations has been pleasant," said Verma (48), vice president of The Asia Group, a strategy and capital advisory group based in Washington DC
 As you know, in the last two or three years of the Obama administration, we have had a lot of Progress has been made and the credit goes to Prime Minister Modi and (former) President Obama
 hamane kai alag-alag kshetron main kaam kiya kai vaartaayen kii jinke vaastavik parinaam nikle, hamaari ummid he ki yah pragati jari rahegi
 The former ambassador played a key role in strengthening us-india relations during his tenure in the Obama administration
 verma ne bharat ke saath sambandhon ko america ke liye is sadi main sabase mahatvapurn qaraar dete hue kaha hamen keval yah nahin maan lenaa chahie ki kyonki chijen sahi nahin chal raheen to ham unhen apane haal par chhod sakate hai
 Verma said in an interview that he believes the meeting between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June was good
 unhone kaha ki vah raksha ke kshetra main nivesh ke lihaaj se donon deshon ke bich sambandhon ko aage badhate hue dekhnaa chahenge
 He said that it is important that India and the United States have such defense relations and we should make similar relations in the field of modern technologies so that India can get an edge in the competition in land, sky, sea or space
 mujhe lagata he ki yah bahut mahatvapurn he ki bharat ke paas aisi kshamtaayen ho
 Verma hoped that the US would indeed abide by the status of a large defense partner given to India which is completely new and unique
 purv america rajdoot ne 500 arab dollar tak kaa dwipaksheeya vyapaar karne ke lakshya par bhi jor diya
 He said that the economic story of america-india is very different in which there is no loss of the other party from the benefit of either side
 agar koi america company bharat main kaarobaar sthapit karti he to iskaa yah matlab nahin he ki isse america naukariyon main kami aegi
 This probably means increasing market opportunities in Asia and i think the same happens in the context of Indian companies investing in the US
 unhone kaha ki dwipaksheeya vyapaar main sabase zyada badhotaree nijee kshetra main or takanic, navonmesh or hai tech sahyog jaise kshetron par dhyaan lagane se hogi
 Regarding the challenges faced by the relationship between the two countries, Verma said that there are many more opportunities than the challenges
 unhone kaha mujhe lagata he ki bahut badlaav ho rahaa he, jaisaa ki aap jaanate hai ki hamane pichley saal vyapaar, vija or chaatro ke sandarbh main har record tod diya
 There are clearly some differences, some adverse circumstances and especially with regard to immigration and i want to see them resolved
 ech-1 bi vija ke mudde par ek sawaal ke jawaab main verma ne kaha ki hamen ise isi pariprekshya main dekhnaa hoga
 He said that America had issued more than one million visas to Indian citizens, probably 60 thousand of which were H1B visas last year
 bharat ko ech 1bi vija kaa bada hissaa mil rahaa he to hamen ise isi pariprekshya main dekhnaa hoga, haalanki in vija kii sankhya ab bhi bahut kam he
 Significantly, in April, Trump signed a government order to toughen visa program rules to prevent visa misuse
 purv rajdoot ne kaha ham america main aane vaale pravaasiyon kii ruchi yaa utsaah main kami nahin dekhnaa chaahate
 My family and i are migrants

 jail main band aparaadhiyon dwaara lut, hatya or aparaadh kii kisi vaardaat kii sajeesh rachane ke kisse to aapane kai baar sune honge, lekin kya aapane kisi aisi vaardaat ke bare main suna he jisko jail main band kisi apradhi ne khud anjaam diya ho
 One such revelation of the incident, which will not only surprise you, but your trust in the police system will be lost
 yah dindahaade desh kii ab tak kii sabase badi lut kii vaardaat he
 What has been revealed in the biggest plunder case of the country so far in Hajipur, Bihar, is going to reveal the reality of the inferior system of the Bihar Police, due to which the good governance image of Bihar is seen to be broken
 hajipur main 23 november 2019 ko dopaher 12 baje sabase vyast bazaar cinema road ke jagadamba state apartment main gold lone company muthut finance ke aphis main graahak kii shakl main ek ladkaa pahunchaa
 Before opening the office door, the security guard conducted a thorough search of the boy
 jaanch ke baad guard ne ladke ko andar jane kii ijaajat di
 The guard inside the office opened the gate, but instead of entering the robber office, he stood at the gate in such a way that the guards could not close the gate
 tabhi dhadadhad chah lutere daudte hue pahunche
 He caught the guard and entered inside the finance office
 sabhi ke haathon main pistaulen thim
 After another guard at the office, company employees and customers at the tip of the pistol, the beleaguered robbers pulled out the gold packets from the firm's strong room and stuffed it into bags
 mahaj 20 minute ke andar lutere 55 kilo sona lekar nikal bhaage
 To escape from Muthoot Finance's office with gold, the robbers also adopted a vicious method
 ve lut ke baad ek saath nahin bhaage balki thodi-thodi der main ek-ek kar nikle, taaki bheedbhad vaale is bazaar main kisi ko lut jaisi kisi baat kaa shaq na ho
 On a robber's head, carrying the looted gold in the sack, it appears as if a common man
 lut kii vaardaat ko bank ke andar pahunche saat luteron ne anjaam diya to baahar luteron ke kai saathi sisitivi camaron kii jad main aae
 It was a backup team of marauders
 lut kii is vaardaat ko kareeb 15 se 20 aparaadhiyon ne anjaam diya tha
 This incident of day-to-day loot shook the entire Bihar Police Department
 aanan fanan main lut kii is vaardaat kii jaanch ke liye ab tak kii sabase badi esaiti team banaai gai
 The team of senior officers of Bihar Police camped in Hajipur and started searching for the roots of the incident
 jaanch shuru hui lekin bajaae luteron kaa khulaasa hone ke police kii hi kalai khulani shuru ho gai
 The investigation of the police itself revealed the failures of the police
 khulaasa hua ki police kii laaparvaahee ne hi is badi lut ko anjaam tak pahunchane kaa rasta banaaya tha
 In this incident, no robber tried to hide his face
 sisitivi main luteron ke saafe saafe chehre dikh rahe the
 So the police did not have much trouble in identifying the robbers
 agle hi din police ne 6 luteron kaa poster jari kar diya
 CCTV pictures showed that the robber who led the robbery inside the bank is Durdanta Mukul Rai alias Priyaranjan of Vaishali district
 lut ke dauraan mili tasveeron se saat luteron main se jin teen luteron kii pahchaan kar lee gai thi, usamen team leader mukul ke alaava, sona lut ke maamle main pehle se faraar vaishali jile kaa hi virender sharma or samastipur kaa kukhyat vikash jha niklaa
 Virender and Vikas Jha were involved in a 32 kg gold robbery case in Muzaffarpur in February 2019 and were out of the grip of the police
 mahaj 17 saal kaa naaballig mukul urf priyaranjan ilaake main darjanon aapraadhik maamalon kii vajah se kukhyat tha
 The police announced the reward on the robbers
 lekin police ne jaise hi jaanch aage badhaai, ek aisa khulaasa hua jis par khud police ko yakeen kar paanaa mushkil tha
 Mukul Rai aka Priyaranjan, who was the team leader of the loot, released the poster by the police, he was inside the jail jis lutere ko police dhund rahi thi, puraa police mahakama din-raat ek kiye tha vah teen maheene se mujffarpur ke remand home main band tha
 The police rushed to Muzaffarpur after the picture of this vicious robber locked in the remand home came to light, but the information that came to the hands of the police here flew the senses of Bihar Police
 pataa chalaa ki lut ke thik 17 din pehle shaatir mukul ko uske saathi chhudaa le gaye the
 It was revealed that on November 6, the police had brought Mukul to Hajipur court to appear in a case of crime
 hajipur se mujffarpur lautne ke dauraan mukul ke chaar lutere saathi bich sadak par police kii gaadi rokkar pistal kii nok par mukul ko chhudaa le gaye the
 The big question before the police was how despite being absconding, no one was aware of Mukul's absconding
 kyon itane durdaant apradhi ke faraar ho jane ke baad bhi koi exiaar tak darj nahin hui thi
 The robber whose picture was made by making a poster of the Bihar Police to reward people, was behind the bars in the police files during the robbery
 darasal lut kii is badi vaardaat kii planning ke tahat mukul ke saathiyon ne lut ke kareeb 15 din pehle mukul ko police ke changul se nikaalane kii planning kii
 This plan was successful
 remand home ke chaar jawan jo mukul ko peshi se lekar mujffarpur remand home laut rahe the, kaidi mukul ke faraar hone ke baad chupchaap mujffarpur laut gaye
 The Muzaffarpur Remand Home's Superintendent wrote a letter to the Vaishali Police about Mukul's absconding
 dak jab tak vaishali police ko milti or mukul kii faraari kii jaankaree milti tab tak mukul or uske saathiyon ne is lut kii vaardaat ko anjaam de diya tha
 After this revelation, the Bihar police came to the lodge for 20 days after the looted mastermind and 3 days after the robbery
 is lut cond ne bihar police kii puri kalai khol di
 The poster of the second robber Virender Sharma was released by the police
 vah pehle se mujffarpur main hue sona lut maamle main aaropee he or police shaayad uski khoj khabar lenaa bhul gai thi
 After executing the second incident, the police remembered his first incident and Muzaffarpur police reached the robber's house Virender Sharma with a plunder case of 9 months back
 yani police luteron se maheenon peeche thi or lutere ek ke baad ek lut kii vaaradaaten karke police ko khuli chunauti dete dikh rahe hai
 In the same case, another robber was identified as Kishalya, who had robbed 32 kg of gold in Muzaffarpur just nine months before this robbery
 aaropee kishlay mujffarpur bhagavanpur ke apane makaan jameen ko bechakar apane parivaar ke saath bhaag niklaa
 At the Auto Expo, car company Ford introduced the concept version of its hatchback car Figo
 yah ford kaa bharat main behad mahatvakankshi kadam he
 The company believes that this car will give a tough competition to Maruti Diyar and Honda Amaze
 haalanki yah car bazaar main kab utregi, is bare main abhi koi faisla nahin liya gaya he
 Currently, only the exterior of the car has been designed
 ingine or interior donon hi abhi tay nahin he

 Delhi Women's Commission chairperson Swati Maliwal blamed Delhi government officials for the ruin of the one-stop center for rape victims in Delhi
 unhone afasaron par file dabaane kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki dilli main kahin-kahin par hi van stop centre shuru ho paaya he
 There are 1 stop centers operating in 11 hospitals
 maliwal ne shanivaar ko kaha ki kejariwal ne is par kaaphi kaam kiya he lekin afasaron ke filein dabaae rakhane se is babat koi kaam nahin ho paaya he

 Under which it was decided to open a one stop center for the victims of rape
 rajya sarkaron ne tay kiya kirep peeditaonko kahin bhatakana naa pade or ek hi chat ke neeche (ek centre) unhen medical, police, manovaigyanik, kanoonee or anya sahaytaaen mil saken
 For this, Rs 1 thousand crore was given annually from Nirbhaya Fund
 iske baad paanch varshon main desh main dedh sau centre banakar kaagajon main darj hue lekin adhiktar kii haalat badahaal he
 Being a single window as per the plans of the center, the victim has to come here first
 yaheen par peedita kii exiaar darj kii jaani he
 But Delhi hardly has any stop center where FIR is being lodged
 van stop centre kii guidelins kahati hai ki centre main computer hone chahie, jinamempiditaonka data darj kiya ja sake
 Apart from this, there should also be a facility of video conferencing
 aapako bataa den ki dilli ke 11 jilon main dilli sarkaar van stop centre chalaati he, iske liye centre sarkaar kaa sahyog nahin leti or na hi nirbhaya fund kaa istemaal karti he

 As the election date of Uttar Pradesh is getting closer, the stirring in the political corridors is continuously increasing
 somvaar ko dinabhar akhilesh yadav ke 403 ummidavaaron kii list par charchaa chalati rahi
 To find his name in the list, the party's mlas and ministers were restless, who were seen outside Mulayam Singh's house and sometimes Akhilesh's program was present
 in khabaron ke bich ek charchaa saream rahi ki mukhyamantri ne isbaar chunaav ladane kii apni ichha bhi is list main bataa di he, sutron ke mutabik akhilesh yadav ne bundelkhand kii do siton se chunaav ladane kii ichha jataai he
 If sources are to be believed, the Charkhari of Mahoba of Bundelkhand and the Babina seat of Lalitpur have been kept for themselves by Akhilesh Yadav
 haalanki akhilesh yadav pehle hi saarvajanik taur se bundelkhand se bhi chunaav ladane kii apni ichha jataa chuke he
 Why did Akhilesh choose Bundelkhand? Samajwadi Party has never won the two seats whose names have come out, along with SP is considered weak in Bundelkhand
 gauratlab he ki bundelkhand uttar pradesh kaa sabase pichhadaa or garib ilaaka mana jaataa he, bundelkhand main kisaanon kii aatmahatya bade darje par hoti he
 Akhilesh wants to forge his new identity from here, which will also exclude him from the aura of father and family
 alag pahchaan banane kii koshishais list main apni seat ke aage bundelkhand likhane kaa ek bada makasad he, akhilesh yadav na sirf apane pita ke rajanithik prabhamandal se baahar aane ko chatapata rahe hai balki chaahate he ki itawa, mainpuri or saifai ke tag se baahar aakar apni alag pahchaan bana len
 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav is still in the Legislative Council but wants to be an MLA and represent him from the area where Samajwadi Party will start from zero and it is an attempt to do its own politics on its own
 saafe he mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kaa ye bada raajnneetik daanv he jiske sateek baithne kii gunjaaish kaaphi he

 Meaning a person tells the truth, so the Congress tells the truth
 unhone duusare mandir kii tulana bijepi se kii or kaha ki wo nafrat failaate hai, lekin congress nafrat nahin karti he
 Rahul Gandhi said that today the country is in difficulty

 There is no money in farming, so suicide has to be done
 unhone kaha ki desh main yuva berogaar baithe hai
 The trust he placed on PM Modi has been broken

 Rahul Gandhi said that youth have energy, power to change the country, but there is a wall between them and our leaders, so my job will be to break the wall
 lekin gusse se nahin pyaar se
 The wall has different forms

 But i want to say that the workers will get tickets, this is what we did in Gujarat
 duusari diwaar ke bare me rahul ne kaha ki rajaneta or yuvaaon ke bich main diwaar he
