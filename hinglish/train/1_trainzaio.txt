 pehle se hi congress dwaara vidhansabha kaa gheraav karne ke liye notice diya gaya tha
 For the first time in the country, more than one lakh applications have been received for admission of first class in Kendriya Vidyalayas of Delhi
 lekin aavedan kaa chayan computer ke jariye karne kaa daawa fail hone ke kaaran prashasan kaa kaam kam hone kii bajaay bad gaya he
 More than one lakh applications Pilot project of online admission of first class has been largely successful by combining two shifts in 65 Kendriya Vidyalayas of Delhi
 pehali kakshake liye ek lakh 15 hajaar 578 aavedan mili hai
 However, the claim of the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan that after the online admission, all the students will also be selected from a specially designed software, completely flopped
 haal yah he ki ab ek lakh se adhik aavednon kaa puraa vairiffication prashasan apane aap kar rahaa he or isamen kaaphi samay lag rahaa he
 At the same time, the Kendriya Vidyalaya claims that online admission was completely successful and this has brought great relief to the parents
 parents kii bhagdaud kam hone kaa daavakendriya vidhyalay sanghathan ke dipti ayukta santosh mirdha ne bataaya ki pehle parents ko in skulon main admician karaane ke liye kaaphi bhagdaud kerani padati thi
 They were able to apply in maximum two-three schools, but this time they have applied in more than ten places
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay ne dilli ke kendriya vidyalayon main online admician ke payalat project kii ghoshnaa kii thi or isi kii safalataa ke aadhaar par desh main ise lagu karne kii yojana he, lekin badi baadha computer ke jariye chayan prakiya kii nigaraanee he kyonki vidyalayon main kai category ke tahat vidhyaarthiyon kaa chayan hota he
 There may be a dispute, according to a top organization official, there is a possibility of a dispute over the name coming through the computer
 yahi kaaran he is baar chayan computer se naa hokar pehle kii prakiya ke tahat hi kiya ja rahaa he
 Seats are being distributed in Kendriya Vidyalayas of Delhi as before
 online admician khatm ho gaya he or chayan prakriya ke tahat ek-ek karke list jari kii ja rahi hajulai tak chalegi prakriyadilli main pehali kaksha ke liye kul siton main se economical vikar section , essi, asti or obisi ke liye siten surakshit kii gai hai
 Kendriya Vidyalaya says that the selection process should be started with computer, work is going on for this and the effort is that from next year, online admission and selection can be implemented in schools across the country
 philhal dilli main july tak chayan prakriya jari rahegi
 Therefore, the selection process will be long, Delhi's Assistant Commissioner Indu says that if the parents who have applied in more than one school and the child's admission comes to two schools, then one seat which is vacant will be given to the children with waiting
 yahi vajah he ki chayan prakiya lambii chalegi
 At the moment, one benefit from the online process is that parents have got the opportunity to apply in many schools sitting at home and the chances of admission of children have also increased compared to earlier

 In 1989, Arvind Kejriwal had received a job offer letter from ONGC in the hands of IIT Kharagpur after completing his studies in mechanical engineering
 magar unhone jid kar lee- naukari to mujhe usee tata steel main hi kerani he, jisane intervyuu main riject kar diya
 Actually, Arvind Kejriwal's first interview with Tata Steel Jamshedpur was a disappointment, he did not consider the company worth the job then
 kejariwal itane ziddee tehre ki unhone dobaaraa intervyuu ke liye tata steel company mukhyalay tak guhaar laga daali
 Said that if he gets just one more chance of interview, then he will prove himself
 aakhirkaar company ne unka phir se intervyuu liya
 This time the matter went in favor of Kejriwal and he was found to be a job fit in the eyes of Tata Steel
 training ke baad jamshedpur main vah tata steel main assistant manager bane
 But in no time Kejriwal got bored while working as a manager
 phir unhen laga ki jo vah karnaa chaahate hai uske liye civil sarvent bananaa hoga
 He thought of preparing for civil services
 khud par aatmavishvaas itnaa tha ki unhone taiyaari ke liye tata steel kii pratishthit naukari bhi chhod di
 It was from here that the stony path of Kejriwal's struggles was prepared, on which he was able to reach the chair of the Chief Minister of Delhi today
 16 agast 1968 ko janme arvind kejariwal kaise ejineering kii field se nikalakar naukarshahi(beuroperesi) main ghuse or phir raajnneeti main safalataa kii sidhiyaan chadhate gaye
 Read about his political journey on his birthday
 ban gaye iares afsarek taraf civil services kii taiyaari jari thi, duusari taraf kejariwal soshal sarvice bhi karte the
 During this time he met Mother Teresa and worked for two months at the Kalighat Ashram under his direction
 baad main unhone ram krishna mishan or chrishchiyan bros association se judakar bhi kaam kiya
 Kejriwal, along with the Nehru Yuva Kendra, did social service work in rural areas
 is bich unki jari civil services kii taiyaari rang laai or 1995 main vah bhartiya rajasav seva(iares) main chun liye gaye
 During the election campaign, Arvind Kejriwal (file photo-facebook) quit looking after corruption and started working as an IRS officer in the Income Tax Department
 dekha ki jo mahakama karpshan khatm karne or tex choron ko pakadaney ke liye banaaya gaya he, vahiin par lut-khasot machi he
 Officers have to do wrong things under high pressure
 inakam tex survey main khel ho rahaa he
 All this was beyond the imagination of Arvind Kejriwal, which he used to understand before joining the government job
 arvind kejariwal ne naukari ke saath samaaj seva main bhi sakriy rahane kaa faisla kiya
 In 1999, he launched a campaign against corruption through an organization called 'parivartan'
 yaheen se kejariwal kii anti karpshan activist ke taur par pahchaan banani shuru hui
 In 1999, Kejriwal made headlines by revealing the ration scam in Delhi
 iares afasar rahete hue unhone is ghotaale kaa khulaasa kiya tha, lihaaja charchaa lajimi thi
 In 2006, when Arvind Kejriwal was the Joint Commissioner of Income Tax in New Delhi, he resigned from his job
 ab kejariwal phul timer activest ban chuke the
 Kejriwal was also associated with the movement to implement the RTI Act for transparency in the country
 centre sarkaar kii ore se taiyaar lokapal ko jokapaal bataakar uski pratiyaan kabhi kejariwal ne jalaayin thim
 (photo-facebook) Anna movement brought national identity After leaving IRS job, now Arvind Kejriwal started conducting social activities from Kaushambi house in Ghaziabad
 baat 2010 kii he, jab vah maharashtra ke gandhivadi samajasevi anna hajaare ke kareeb aae
 This was the time when there was public outrage over many big scandals which came to light in the Manmohan government
 log ek netritv kii taraf aashaa bhari nigahon se dekh rahe the
 Kejriwal realized the pulse of the public on time
 phir janalokapal ko bhrashtachar ke khatme kaa bada aujaar bataate hue anna hajaare ke netritv main unhone janalokapal andolan kii neenv daali
 The movement was run under the India Against Corruption banner campaign
 2011 kaa vakt desh main anna andolan ke liye janaa jaataa he
 The crowd of thousands of people who had come from all corners of the country in the hope of change spontaneously gathered for several days and nights in Ramlila Maidan
 yah puraa andolan aaj bhi raajnneetishastriyon ke liye ek kautuhal or adhyayan kaa vishay rahaa he
 It is said that the face of the movement was Gandhian Anna Hazare, but the whole plan behind it was Arvind Kejriwal
 team anna hajaare main foot hone ke peeche aarope lagate rahe ki arvind kejariwal ne andolan hai jaik kar liya tha
 Anna Hazare was against entering politics, but Kejriwal started the Aam Aadmi Party with a few colleagues in November 2012 to offer alternative politics
 kaha jaataa he ki andolan ke dinon main ek varisht patrkaar ke ghar hui meeting ke dauraan kejariwal ke dilodimag main party banane kaa khyaal aayaa tha
 Anna Hazare and Kejriwal parted ways with the formation of the party, which could not be reunited till today
 kejariwal ne chunaavon main karishma kar dikhayaam aadmi party ne saal bhar main hi karishma kar dikhaaya
 It emerged as the largest party in the 2013 assembly elections with 28 seats
 bahumat na hone par congress ne ek ranneeti ke tahat samarthan diya to kejariwal 28 disambar 2013 ko pehali baar mukhyamantri bane
 But because of the alliance, which was openly involved in making decisions, Kejriwal resigned after 49 days
 phir 2015 main kejariwal ne wo kiya, jisaki khud unki hi party ne kalpana nahin kii thi
 It created new history by winning 67 out of 70 seats
 sirf teen siten us bijepi ko mili, jo 2014 main hi centre kii satta main pahunch chuki thi
 Arvind Kejriwal was sworn in as Chief Minister for the second time on 14 February 2015

 Some things related to Kejriwal - Arvind Kejriwal has written a book called Swaraj in 2012
 jisamen unki najar main vikalp kii raajnneeti kya he, isko lekar vichaar hai
 Close to Arvind Kejriwal says that he sleeps only for four hours
 -sahpaathee bataate hai ki jab vah college ke dinon main khaali vakt ghoomte the, tab kejariwal jhuggi-jhopadiyon main bacchon ko padhaate the or anya tarah ke soshal work main samay bitaate the

 bihar ke mukhya mantri nitish kumaar ke liye kuch raahat kii khabar he
 While he is facing criticism from leaders of his own ally BJP BJP for water logging in Patna, another ally, Lok Janshakti Party President and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has come to his rescue
 haalanki paswan ne patna kaa jal jamaav kaa koi zikr to nahin kiya lekin unhone shanivaar ko ek twit kar zarur kaha ki rajya ke mukhiya ke taur par aapane (nitish kumaar) sushasan kii nayi paribhaasha likhi he
 Actually, this tweet Paswan has once again congratulated Nitish Kumar on being elected the national president of Janata Dal United
 unhone unke kushal netritv main janata dal united kii nayi oonchaai par le jane ke liye taareef kii
 Certainly, Paswan's tweets are a relief news for the leaders of Janata Dal United as BJP leaders are currently leaving no stone unturned to target Nitish Kumar on the pretext of water logging
 had to tab ho gayi jab mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha ki mumbai bhi duubataa he tab koi kyon nahin bolta he, is par bhaajapa ke ek nav niyukt pravaktaa nikhil anand ne unki baton ko katate hue kaha ki vahaan se pani bhi jald nikal jaataa he
 It was clear from the statement of BJP leaders that they wanted to split the entire water logging on Nitish Kumar
 unhen maaloom he ki nagar vikaas vibhaag main bijepi ke mantri rahane ke baavjood, nagar nigam apane kabje main hone ke baavjood or nagar ke saare vidhayak bijepi ke hai iske baad bachaav main kuch bachataa nahin

 Governor's rule has come into force in Jammu and Kashmir with President Dr
 Pranab Mukherjee approving the recommendation of Jammu and Kashmir Governor NN Vohra, but this question still emerged as the largest party in the state along with PDP as well as Central Government It is also troubling that whether the state will have to hold elections again, or a new government will take over in the next 10 days
 pidipi ko lag rahaa tha ki vah bijepi ko apni sharton par rajaamand kar legi, lekin aisa nahin ho sakaa, kyonki bijepi ne apana rukh kadaa banaae rakhaa
 According to a senior state official, "the PDP felt that it was compromising with the NDA of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's time, but it was the bjp's absolute majority government, so it made a difference
" 
 
 " udhar, pidipi ke netaa naeem akhtar kaa ab bhi kahana he, "abhi 10 din baaki hai, pidipi sarkaar bana legi
 
 
 " vaise, rajyapal ne jammu-kashmir ke samvidhan ke section 92 ke tahat rajya main rajyapal shashan lagu kiya he, jiske tahat chah maah tak rajyapal kaa shashan rah saktaa he, or uske baad samaysima badhaane ke liye cabinet kii manjuuri zaruri he
 However, this is not the first time that Governor's rule has been imposed in Jammu and Kashmir
 
 
 26 march se 9 july, 1977 main 105 din tak jammu-kashmir main rajyapal shashan rahaa, tab rajyapal alke jha the, or tab shaikh abdulla kii sarkaar se congress ne samarthan waapas liya tha
 From March 6 to November 7, 1986, Jammu and Kashmir was under Governor's rule for 246 days, when Governor Jagmohan was there, and even then the Congress first toppled Farooq Abdullah's government, and then Ghulam Mohammad's government, but in March 1986 Congress withdrew support from the government
 19 janvari, 1990 se 9 oktober, 1996 tak, yani chah saal or 264 din tak, tab rajyapal jagmohan the, or tab farrukh abdulla ne jagmohan ke rajyapal banaae jane par aitraaj karte hue istipha de diya tha
 It is noteworthy that insurgency began in the state only in the 1990s, and during that time when elections were held in 1996, they were held in the shadow of guns
 18 oktober se 2 november, 2002 tak sirf 15 din ke liye, is baar rajyapal jisi saxena the, or tab farrukh abdulla ne keretekar mukhyamantri bane rahane se inkaar kar diya tha, or uske baad hi pidipi ore congress saath aae the
 From 11 July 2008 to 5 January 2009, that is 178 days, then NN Vohra was the Governor, and then the government of Ghulam Nabi Azad was reduced to a minority as the PDP withdrew support on the Amarnath issue
 pidipi ne 28 june, 2008 ko amarnath kii jameen ko mudda banaakar samarthan vaapis liya tha
 This time also, due to the fractured mandate in Jammu and Kashmir, the government has not been formed yet, while the time for formation of government is till 19 January
 rajya main pidipi 28 siton ke saath sabase badi party banakar ubhari he, jabaki bijepi 25 siton se saath duusari badi party he
 PDP and BJP - Both parties have met the Governor, but no formulation of government formation has been found so far
 is baar bhi umr abdulla ne kaaryvahak mukhyamantri bane rahane se inkaar kar diya he, or isaki vajah yah he ki vah khud hi badi mushkil se birwaah se chunaav jite hai, or unke kai mantri haar gaye hai
 In fact, political parties should have forgotten their estrangement in the national interest and given a permanent government, which the state needs most at present, because for the first time people had participated in such a large number of elections, and believed in democracy

 mumbai hamale ke gunahagaar or global aatanki hafiz said ko pakistan main giraftaar kar liya gaya he
 On Wednesday, while the jamaat-ud-dawa chief Hafiz Saeed was going from Lahore to Gujranwala, the Counter Terrorism Team arrested him
 hafiz said ko jail bhej diya gaya he
 This is the first time that Hafiz Saeed has been arrested
 yani ye pehali baar he jab vah jail main gaya he
 However, he has been arrested several times before

 Many evidences were also offered
 uske baad hafiz said ko house arest kiya gaya tha
 In 2006, when the train exploded in Mumbai and many people were killed, its link was linked to Hafiz Saeed's organization
 uske baad antarrashtriya dabaav ke kaaran use phir najarband kiya gaya tha
 In 2008, when the attack took place in Mumbai and its link came out from lashkar-e-taiba, the terrorist leader was arrested in the house
 haalanki har baar kamjor cese kii vajah se baar-baar chhutata gaya
 Hafiz Saeed was under house arrest even before the general elections in Pakistan
 lekin har baar hafiz said ko kuch hi dinon main chhod diya jaataa he
 Significantly, Hafiz Saeed was arrested on Wednesday in a case related to 2009
 is baar aatanki sargana ko lahore kii lakhapat jail main rakhaa jayega

 a month will be completed this week to form the new central government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 iske saath hi, pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane mantriyon or afasaron ko teen kshetron par tatkaal dhyaan dene or karrwai karne ko kaha he
 Although the priority of the government is to bring the deteriorated economy back on track, but the Prime Minister wants to see the three works completed first
 unhone afasaron ko nirdesh diya he ki centre or rajyon ke bich sambandhon ko behatar banaaya jaae, janata kii shikayaton or takalifon ko dur kiya jaae or sena ke liye jaruri hathiyaaron or aujaaron ko bina kisi deree ke uplabdh karavaaya jaae
 The Prime Minister has already instructed the officers that the delay in the works will not be tolerated
 unhone kaha he ki laal fitaashahee kam karke javabdehi or kshamta badhaai jaae
 Now he wants the bureaucrat to redress the complaints coming to his office as soon as possible
 inamen bhi soshal media or websiton par darj hone vaali flites, train tikat, train yatra, telecom, banking, health or pension se judi shikayaton ko khaastaur se tarjeeh di jaaegi
 Apart from this, a special cell has also been set up in the Prime Minister's Office which will monitor how quickly the problems are being solved
 pradhanmantri ne yah bhi faisla kiya he ki vah maheene main kam se kam ek baar sena pramukhon se mila karenge
 Ideally, the question of bureaucracy and political leadership would have been institutionally debated, but often these questions are shoved under the carpet in the name of various committees
 tarakaane kii vajah yah hoti he ki aam taur par donon miljul kar chalate rahete hai lekin kisi mode par takaraav ho jaae to sirf baahar yaa adaalat kaa rasta nazar aata he
 How have you seen the case of IPS officer Amitabh Thakur of Uttar Pradesh
 kya aap unamem se he jo ek wheasal blor or saahsee afasar ke saath ho rahi ninsaphi se naaraaz hai yaa aap un logon main se bhi hai jo ek sarkari adhikari ke rup main amitabh thakur ke ati utsaah ko lekar ashankit hai
 Anyway, but the conversation which was taped by Amitabh Thakur made public, it seems that Mulayam Singh Yadav has encroached
 hamadardi kii yaad dilaane ke bahaane dhamkee hi di he
 Registering and suspending rape cases after a few hours of trying to improve shows what was indicated to Amitabh Thakur
 baatcheet kaa lehza zarur naram he magar baat sakht he
 In this conversation, Mulayam Singh Yadav is reminding us of a Jasrana incident that such a situation will happen
 darasal 2006 main jasrana main amitabh thakur par samaajawaadee party ke vidhayak ramvir singh yadav or unke samarthakon ne hamalaa kiya tha, baad main aaropee ramvir or anya logon ko bari kar diya gaya kyonki maamle se jude kai gavaah palat gaye
 In this conversation, Mulayam is also saying that he has been sympathetic to you
 main patna gaya
 
 ghar waalon ne kaha meraa ladkaa he dekhte rahanaa
 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said that Netaji also scolds us
 fark ye he ki ve unki party ke netaa hai or pita bhi
 But what are they of the authorities
 mulaayam singh yadav kii kyon hamadardi thi or ve patna amitabh ke ghar kyon gaye, agar itani hamadardi thi to amitabh thakur mulaayam singh yadav ke mukhyamantri rahete hue do baar kyon suspend hue
 Recording and making the conversation public can be controversial but if it is not public then how do we know how our politicians talk to the officers
 zarur amitabh thakur mulaayam singh yadav ke kilaaf thane main taharir likhaane pahunch gaye
 Former UP DGP Prakash Singh, who spoke on police reforms, says Amitabh Thakur should not have done it
 amitabh thakur ek jununee adhikari hai
 Amitabh and his wife have released more than 500 RTI applications
 unki patni nutan thakur swatantra haisiyat se bilkul ye kaam kar sakati hai lekin amitabh kii sakriyata ek nai or rochak parampara to kaayam karti hi he
 After all, taking inspiration from this couple who have filed one hundred and fifty pils, Prime Minister Modi or the Chief Minister of any other state should encourage his officers to do so or the officers may start filing public interest petitions taking inspiration from Amitabh
 vaise gujarat main ipies kuldeep sharma kaa maamla yaad hoga
 When his fight with the government went on, the case against him closed twenty years ago was opened
 haryana ke ashok khemka ne transport vibhaag main bhrashtachar se ladanaa shuru hi kiya tha ki tabadalaa ho gaya
 Another Haryana officer Sanjeev Chaturvedi's case went to the Supreme Court but he never appeared before the media
 ashok khemka media ke saamne zarur aae magar ve hameshaa apni seemaa ko rekhaankit kiya karte the
 So does Amitabh Thakur, like Sanjeev Chaturvedi and Ashok Khemka, be honest and bat the other way
 is par bahes ho sakati he lekin ek aiji str ke afasar ke khilaaf balaatkaar kaa maamla darj karnaa bhi kuch kam zyaadati nahin he
 It is another matter that in view of the excesses of pils filed by Amitabh Thakur and his wife, the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court was angered by a PIL by Amitabh Thakur on 9 June 2014, the court prohibited him from doing PIL without government permission
 Put it isi tarah 11 april 2014 ko nutan thakur kii ek piiel se naaraaz hoicourt ne piiel se pehle unase 25,000 rupee adaalat main jamaa karne kii shart laga di thi
 The comments kya koi bhi sarkaar apane afasar ko amitabh kii tarah piiel karne, dharna pradarshan main shaamil hone yaa swatantra evam vyaktigat jaanch ayog banane ke liye protsaahit karegi
 Probably not
 agar baaki sarkaron ko yah pasand he to apane adhikariyon ke liye aisa circular jari kar sakati hai
 Similarly, another officer of UP, Surya Pratap Singh, continues to criticize the state government on his Facebook page
 fasebuk unka nijee spes he jahaan ve upi ke saarvajanik udhyam vibhaag ke pramukh sachiv pad par rahete hue sarkaar par sawaal khadey karne vaali khabaron ko chaspa karte rahete hai
 Surya Pratap Singh says that he is creating consciousness in public
 lekin fasebuk se baahar ve nakal virdohi pradarshan main bhi hissaa le chuke hai
 Government s
 pi
 Singh has not been suspended
 amitabh thakur sirf sarkaar se nahin ladate lekin apni police ke afasaron se bhi lard jate hai
 If Amitabh Thakur is breaking the rules of the police department then what is the new law? mulaayam singh yadav kaa phone karnaa or baad main jo bhi hua kya wo peshewar kaayda he
 In the last three and a half years, there have been eight Director General of Police in UP
 amitabh to kai saal se sakriy hai lekin abhi kyon nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Did all this happen because of the handing over of the mining mafia, which troubled the government as an excuse for their activism in the media and movements
 aapane uttar pradesh ke ipies adhikari amitabh thakur ke maamle ko kis nazar se dekha he
 Are you among those who are angry at the injustice done to a whistleblower and courageous officer or are you among those who are apprehensive about Amitabh Thakur's extreme enthusiasm as a government official
 kaise bhi dekhen lekin jis baatcheet ko tepe kar amitabh thakur ne saarvajanik kiya he usase to yahi lagata he ki mulaayam singh yadav ne atikaraman kiya he
 He has threatened to remind us of sympathy
 sudhar jane kii naseehat ke kuch ghante ke baad balaatkaar ke maamle darj karana or nilambit karnaa bataata he ki amitabh thakur ko kya sanket diya ja rahaa tha
 The tone of the conversation is soft, but it is strong
 is baatcheet main mulaayam singh yadav kisi jasrana prasang kii yaad dilaa rahe hai ki waisi haalat ho jaaegi
 In 2006, Amitabh Thakur was attacked in Jasrana by Samajwadi Party MLA Ramvir Singh Yadav and his supporters, later acquitting accused Ramvir and others as several witnesses related to the case were overturned
 isi baatcheet main mulaayam yah bhi kah rahe hai ki aapse hamadardi rahi he
 i went to Patna 
 The housemates said that my boy is there to keep watching
 mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki netaji hamen bhi daant dete hai
 The difference is that he is the leader of his party and also the father
 lekin ve adhikariyon ke kya hai
 Why was Mulayam Singh Yadav sympathetic and why did he go to Patna Amitabh's house, if there was so much sympathy then why was Amitabh Thakur suspended twice as Mulayam Singh Yadav's Chief Minister
 baatcheet record karnaa or saarvajanik karnaa vivaadaaspad ho saktaa he lekin public nahin hota to pataa kaise chalata ki hamaare rajaneta afasaron se kaise baat karte hai
 Surely Amitabh Thakur went to the police station against Mulayam Singh Yadav to write Tahrir
 police sudhaar par baat karne vaale upi ke purv dijipi prakaash singh kehete hai ki amitabh thakur ko yah nahin karnaa chahie tha
 Amitabh Thakur is a passionate officer
 amitabh or unki patni ne 500 se zyaada artiai aplication jari kiye hai
 His wife Nutan Thakur can do these things with independent status, but Amitabh's activism maintains a new and interesting tradition
 aakhir paune dau sau janhit yachikaayen daayar karne vaale is yugal se prerana lekar pradhanmantri modi yaa kisi anya rajya ke mukhyamantri apane afasaron ko aisa karne ke liye protsaahit karen yaa afasar amitabh se swat prerana lete hue janhit yachikaayen daayar karne lag sakate hai
 By the way, the case of IPS Kuldeep Sharma in Gujarat will be remembered
 sarkaar se unki ladaai chali to unke khilaaf bees saal pehle band ho chuke maamle ko khol diya gaya
 Ashok Khemka of Haryana started fighting corruption in the Transport Department that was transferred
 haryana ke ek or adhikari sanjeev chaturvedi kaa maamla supreme court tak gaya lekin ve kabhi media ke saamne nahin aae
 Ashok Khemka came before the media, but he always outlined his limits
 to kya amitabh thakur, sanjeev chaturvedi or ashok khemka kii tarah eemaandaar hote hue duusari tarah batting karte hai
 It can be debated but even registering a rape case against an IG level officer is nothing less
 ye or baat he ki amitabh thakur or unki patni kii janhit yachikaaon kii jyadatiyon ko dekhte hue elahabaad hai court kii lakhanu bench ne 9 june 2014 ko amitabh thakur kii ek janhit yachika se naaraaz hokar adaalat ne un par bina sarkari anumati ke piiel karne par roak laga di
 Similarly, on 11 April 2014, the angry High Court from a PIL of Nutan Thakur made a condition of depositing Rs 25,000 from the court before the PIL
 tippaniyan Will any government encourage its officers to PIL like Amitabh, participate in picketing demonstrations or set up an independent and personal inquiry commission
 shaayad nahin
 If other governments like this, they can issue such circulars for their officials
 isi tarah upi ke ek or afasar surya pratap singh apane fasebuk pej par rajya sarkaar kii kaaphi aalochana karte rahete hai
 Facebook is his personal space where he keeps on pandering news questioning the government while holding the post of Principal Secretary, Department of Public Enterprises of UP
 surya pratap singh kaa kahana he ki ve janata main chetana paidaa kar rahe hai
 But outside of Facebook, he has also participated in anti-copycat demonstrations
 sarkaar ne es
 P
 singh ko suspend nahin kiya he
 Amitabh Thakur not only fights the government but also fights with his police officers
 agar amitabh thakur police mahakme ke kaayade ko tod rahe hai to sarkaar koun sa nayaa kaayda bana rahi he
 Calling Mulayam Singh Yadav and whatever happened later is professional Qaida
 pichley saadhe teen saal main upi main aath-aath police mahanideshak hue hai
 Amitabh has been active for many years but why was he just targeted
 kya khanan mafia par haath daalane ke kaaran yah sab hua jisase pareshaan sarkaar ne media or andolanon main unki sakriyata kaa bahaanaa banaaya
 Registering and suspending rape cases after a few hours of trying to improve shows what was indicated to Amitabh Thakur
 baatcheet kaa lehza zarur naram he magar baat sakht he
 In this conversation, Mulayam Singh Yadav is reminding us of a Jasrana incident that such a situation will happen
 darasal 2006 main jasrana main amitabh thakur par samaajawaadee party ke vidhayak ramvir singh yadav or unke samarthakon ne hamalaa kiya tha, baad main aaropee ramvir or anya logon ko bari kar diya gaya kyonki maamle se jude kai gavaah palat gaye
 In this conversation, Mulayam is also saying that he has been sympathetic to you
 main patna gaya
 
 ghar waalon ne kaha meraa ladkaa he dekhte rahanaa
 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said that Netaji also scolds us
 fark ye he ki ve unki party ke netaa hai or pita bhi
 But what are they of the authorities
 mulaayam singh yadav kii kyon hamadardi thi or ve patna amitabh ke ghar kyon gaye, agar itani hamadardi thi to amitabh thakur mulaayam singh yadav ke mukhyamantri rahete hue do baar kyon suspend hue
 Recording and making the conversation public can be controversial but if it is not public then how do we know how our politicians talk to the officers
 zarur amitabh thakur mulaayam singh yadav ke kilaaf thane main taharir likhaane pahunch gaye
 Former UP DGP Prakash Singh, who spoke on police reforms, says Amitabh Thakur should not have done it
 amitabh thakur ek jununee adhikari hai
 Amitabh and his wife have released more than 500 RTI applications
 unki patni nutan thakur swatantra haisiyat se bilkul ye kaam kar sakati hai lekin amitabh kii sakriyata ek nai or rochak parampara to kaayam karti hi he
 After all, taking inspiration from this couple who have filed one hundred and fifty pils, Prime Minister Modi or the Chief Minister of any other state should encourage his officers to do so or the officers may start filing public interest petitions taking inspiration from Amitabh
 vaise gujarat main ipies kuldeep sharma kaa maamla yaad hoga
 When his fight with the government went on, the case against him closed twenty years ago was opened
 haryana ke ashok khemka ne transport vibhaag main bhrashtachar se ladanaa shuru hi kiya tha ki tabadalaa ho gaya
 Another Haryana officer Sanjeev Chaturvedi's case went to the Supreme Court but he never appeared before the media
 ashok khemka media ke saamne zarur aae magar ve hameshaa apni seemaa ko rekhaankit kiya karte the
 So does Amitabh Thakur, like Sanjeev Chaturvedi and Ashok Khemka, be honest and bat the other way
 is par bahes ho sakati he lekin ek aiji str ke afasar ke khilaaf balaatkaar kaa maamla darj karnaa bhi kuch kam zyaadati nahin he
 It is another matter that in view of the excesses of pils filed by Amitabh Thakur and his wife, the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court was angered by a PIL by Amitabh Thakur on 9 June 2014, the court prohibited him from doing PIL without government permission
 Put it isi tarah 11 april 2014 ko nutan thakur kii ek piiel se naaraaz hoicourt ne piiel se pehle unase 25,000 rupee adaalat main jamaa karne kii shart laga di thi
 The comments kya koi bhi sarkaar apane afasar ko amitabh kii tarah piiel karne, dharna pradarshan main shaamil hone yaa swatantra evam vyaktigat jaanch ayog banane ke liye protsaahit karegi
 Probably not
 agar baaki sarkaron ko yah pasand he to apane adhikariyon ke liye aisa circular jari kar sakati hai
 Similarly, another officer of UP, Surya Pratap Singh, continues to criticize the state government on his Facebook page
 fasebuk unka nijee spes he jahaan ve upi ke saarvajanik udhyam vibhaag ke pramukh sachiv pad par rahete hue sarkaar par sawaal khadey karne vaali khabaron ko chaspa karte rahete hai

 aadarneey mir sahab, aapane twit kiya he ki 'neuyork main pradhanmantri nawaz shareef or narendra modi ke bich mulaaqaat nahin hogi, nawaz shareef yuangie main is saal phir kashmiriyon kii awaz uthaaenge' Brother aap na to pakistan videsh vibhaag ke adhikari hai or na hi pradhanmantri daftar ke pravaktaa
 But you have announced a way of not meeting
 aap ek patrkaar hai or agar aapako ye jaankaree aapke vishwast sutron se mili he to wo sutara koi chota motaa adhikari to hoga nahin
 You are a big journalist and the sources of this information may be Nawaz Sharif Sahab himself
 vaise bhi aapke unke rishte itane nazadiiki hai ki unhone hamaare tabake pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko lekar 'dehati aurat' vaala chutkula bhi aapke saath share kiya tha
 Then perhaps on his own instructions, you had withdrawn your words too
 tab aapaki vishwaneeyata par sawaal uthaa tha ki aapkaa pehle vaala bayaan sahi tha yaa baad vaali safaai
 Well aapane 'pradhanmantriyon kii mulaaqaat nahin hogi' vaala twit jis bharose ke saath kiya usase lagata he ki ye sidhe pradhanmantri nawaz shareef se aapako mili jaankaree par aadhaarit he
 Even if one of his special people has given you such 'strong' information, it also has many meanings
 pehla to yah ki aap par goli chalane ke baad (is vaardaat kii ham ninda karte hai or press kii azaadi kaa samarthan karte hai) jio tivi or pakistani sena-iesai ke bich jo tanatani hui usamen miyaan sahab aapke or jio ke saath khadey hue
 He did very well by doing so
 lekin isse sena-iesai ke saath unke matbhed bade
 So the way Mian Sahab put his chair at stake for Xiao, now is the time for him to do something
 isliye aapane ek patrkaar ke taur par apni vishwasaneeyata, apana cheharaa or apane twitor kaa istemaal kiya he
 Your tweet seems to be a technical wave left in an attempt to measure water depth
 lekin aap pakistan ke patrkaar hai, vahaan kii sarkaar nahin ki aapaki taraf se hue elaan par bharat sarkaar kii taraf se koi pratikriya aae
 Of course you have tweeted with the intention of realizing that, let's see what reaction this brings from inside India, but sorry, whatever flaws in India's foreign policy, it is not so shallow
 duusari baat, aapaki vajah se sena or sarkaar ke bich khai badi
 So now it is also up to you to fill this gap
 isliye jahaan twit kaa pehla hissaa america ravaanagi ke pehle pradhanmantri kii taraf se sena-iesai ko bharose main lene kii koshish kii tarah he ki pradhanmantri nawaz shareef shapath grahan samaaroh main shirqat kar pradhanmantri modi se milane kii 'pichhali galati' ko is baar nahin doharaaenge
 Coming to New Delhi, he did not give a strong statement on Kashmir nor met Hurriyat leaders
 vahiin, aapke twit kaa doosraa hissaa miyaan saabah kii isi 'galati' kii bharpai kii koshish main juta nazar aa rahaa he
 
 
 'nawaz Sharif will raise the voice of Kashmiris again in the UNGA this year '
 aapke is twit ko nai dilli ke kai channelon ne pramukhataa se chalaaya
 It may be that many of our diplomatic leaders insist on adopting a 'no-no-no-no' attitude from Pakistan
 aise main modi-shareef mulaaqaat nahin hogi or aap patrkaar ke taur par is schoop ke liye bhi jane jaaegein ki dekho mir bhai ne haftaa pehle hi bataa diya tha! On the other hand, your army and a section sitting in ISI may also have liked your tweet
 unhone iskaa zarur yah arth nikaala hoga ki miyaan sahab der aae durust aae
 Now they will do as per the wishes of Pakistan Army, start talking with Kashmir and end it on Kashmir itself
 is tarah se sena or sarkaar ke bich kii khai kaaphi had kar kam ho jaaegi
 There is also a third aspect
 pradhanmantri modi ke shapath grahan main aa kar miyaan sahab ne jo 'paap' kiya tha, aapkaa twit uske praayshchit kii disha main pehla qadam jaisaa he
 Mian Saheb was marginalized in Pakistan after the spectacular decision of this tour of India
 ve kahaan to apana statsmanship dikhaane aae the ki dekho main itnaa taaqatvar piem hum ki sena kii nahin sunata
 But when the domestic media was upset, tough questions were asked, they felt what happened

 In the list of Vyapam-related deaths, the case of Namrata Damor's death came under scrutiny, but the speed with which his file has been closed raises questions
 darasal, gaur kiya jaae to namrata kii maut kii kahani railway line se shuru hokar postmortem report or shamshaan main dafan laash ke bich kuch is kadar gumti he yaa phir ghumaai jaati he ki pal bhar main hatya khudakushi main badal jaati he
 Just think, after independence, India saw a lot of scams, but for the first time there was a scam which is in the discussion due to blood stains more than the tinkle of coins
 ise dilachasp kahie yaa phir durbhaagya ki jis ghotaale ko lekar pehali shikaayat 2009 main hui thi, 2015 ke aate-aate usamen 45 se adhik laashen bich gai hai or shivaraj ke daur main yamraj kaa 'khel' jari he
 The special thing is that the era also belongs to Narendra Modi and the 'shivraj model of development' is a superhit for the NDA government
 baat namrata kii vaaya narmadanamrata kii mautki sachai kii pehali tasviir us railway line kii he, jahaan se uskaa shav mila tha
 The second photo is of a post-mortem report in which Namrata's life is due to breathlessness and suffocation, and the third picture is to extract the body of humility from the crematorium to prove the theory of turning the murder into suicide
 yani 11 maheene main police ne namrata kii hatya ko khudakushi main tabdeel kar file band kar di
 Just think, on January 7, the driver of Narmada Express going from Indore to Ujjain Bhopal on January 7 stopped the train after seeing the dead body lying on the railway track from a distance of a hundred meters
 phone se stesan master ko jaankaree di
 The station master informed the police that near the ujjain-maxi railway line, there was a dead body in front of Bhairupura KV pole number 78 / 9-11
 lekin police ne jo report taiyaar kii usamen shav ko bhopal vaaya ujjain indore trek par dikhaaya gaya
 The police, in its report, mentioned that Namrata was killed by jumping from Namarda Express
 iske liye baqayda namarda express kii es-8 bogi main seat number- 3 par rigerveshan hone kaa tikat bhi dikhaaya gaya
 So the first question is that even if Namrata jumped from the Namarda Express, how did the dead body reach the Indore to Bhopal track instead of the Bhopal to Bhopal track? was
 isiilie agyaat shav kaa postmortem hua jise teen anbhavi doctor bibi purohit, opi gupta or anita joshi ne taiyaar kiya
 The pressures in this report are known
 naak par nakhun ke teen nishaan ke hone kaa zikr tasviir banaakar kiya gaya
 Moreover, the cause of death was said to be suffocation and smothering i
e
 nose, mouth, strangulation
 postmarptom report main saaf likhaa gaya ki maut saans rukne se hui
 So the second question is when the post-mortem report itself ruled out suicide, under which theory did the police turn the murder into suicide
 nai report ko banaaya aadharatisri tasviir kirathpur shamshaan ghat kii he, jahaan se police ne 20 din baad 29 janvari 2012 ko namrata kaa shav nikaala
 Because by then, his family had identified with the poster posted in the police station of Azhat dead body and after that the police decided in a jolt that apart from the post-mortem, a second opinion was taken, then DS Badukar, director of Medicolegal Institute in Bhopal, got medical on 7 February 2012
 Sent for investigation
 dow
 Badukar submitted his 25-page report to the police on 30 March 2012
 isamen namrata kii maut ko khudakushi qaraar diya gaya
 Police also made the report of Modikaligal Institute Director Badurkar in place of postmortem to close its file and on 28 December 2012, the file was closed saying that the death was not a suicide
 rus, ukraine, america, israel or philistin samet 43 deshon ke sailaaniyon ko aaj se i-vija kii suvidha mil sakegi
 Let's know what is this e-visa and what is the procedure to get it
 
 
 micro-bloging website twitor par shaayad hi koi aisa hindustani hoga, jo videshmantri sushamaa swaraj ko nahin jaanata hoga
 
 
 Sushma Swaraj's 'helping all' nature is one of the most liked people on Twitter, which has made her a 'can be remembered in trouble'
 
 
 so, aisi chhavi vaale netaa ke twitor account se block kiya gaya koi bhi shaks duhkhi to hoga hi
 
 
 There are some people, about whom we came to know recently, and such people could not do anything till now, could not cry their grief in front of anyone, but now they got a page from which they expected They would probably be unblocked on appeal
 
 
 tippaniyan So, such blocked people chose Swaraj Kaushal, former Governor of External Affairs Minister, to tell their problems, and told them their problems, but the most interesting aspect of this exercise is whether anything else has come out or not
 , The world has definitely come to know that Swaraj Kaushal's 'sense of Humor' is no less than his wife
 
 
 jin logon ne videshmantri ke account se anblock kiye jane kaa anurodh unke pati se kiya he, un sabhi ko swaraj kaushal tatparta se puri haazirajavaabi ke saath jawaab de rahe hai, or log unhen pard-padhakar aanandit ho rahe hai
 
 
 Actually, the story started on Monday night, when a man wrote that the foreign minister had blocked him, the former governor wrote, "oh
 
 
 meri patni ne aapako block kiya tha
 
 
 Now i will apologize for following you
 
 
 " Oh! My wife has blocked you? i will apologize to her for following you

 iske jawaab main purv governor sahab ne likhaa, "sunakar acha laga

 Swaraj Kaushal is promptly replying to all those who have requested her husband to unblock the account of the External Affairs Minister, and people are happy reading them
 
 
 darasal, kissa somvaar raat ko shuru hua tha, jab ek shaks ne likhaa ki videshmantri ne unhen block kar diya he, to purv governor ne likhaa, "oh
 
 
 My wife blocked you
 
 
 ab aapako follow karne ke liye main unase maafee maagunga
 
 
 " Oh ! My wife has blocked you ? i will apologise to her for following you
 https: / / t
 co / quvcsaardl - Governor Swaraj (@governorswaraj) December 19, 2016 
 
 
 And perhaps it was this tweet, which raised hopes in the minds of the 'blocked' people, and Swaraj Kaushal started getting requests to get unblocked one by one
 
 
 khayr, bina der kiye unhone bhi ek ke baad ek jawaab, jo har baar pehle se zyaada dilachasp hota chalaa gaya, dena jari rakhaa

 kendra main sattarudh narendra modi sarkaar apane kaarykaal ke aakhri padaav par he
 In the next few months, the bugle of general elections is going to be held
 26 may 2014 ko modi sarkaar ne shapath lee thi
 a new government is to be formed in May 2019
 iske liye modi sarkaar apane nae naare kaa elaan kar chuki he
 Fair intentions right development, Modi government again in 2019
 aise main desh kii janata ke saamne ahm sawaal hai ki kya 2019 main aam chunaavon kii voting se pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi se adhik lokapriyata congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii he? kya aagaamee chunaavon main rahul gandhi pradhanmantri pad ke prabal daavedaar hai?gauratlab he ki aath saal pehle desh kii raajnneeti main bataur pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar rahul gandhi kii lokapriyata us vakt ek rajya ke mukhyamantri rahe narendra modi se adhik thi
 At the same time, disputes around Narendra Modi were also deep
 haalanki isaki ek vajah pradhanmantri pad kii daud main bijepi se laal krishna adwani kii maujuudagi bhi thi
 But when a consensus began to form in Modi's name within the party, he not only succeeded in leaving Lal Krishna Advani behind, but also overtook Rahul Gandhi in popularity
 janvari 2014 tak narendra modi bataur pradhanmantri puure desh kii pehali pasand bane or chunaav tak rahul gandhi unke najadik bhi nahin pahunch sake
 How did Modi get the economy? The truth is hidden in Chidambaram's last budget
now when the general election is going to sound in 2019, Rahul Gandhi has narrowed the gap with Narendra Modi in terms of popularity
 haalanki aisa bhi nahin he ki narendra modi is daud main pichad rahe hai
 Yes, it is definitely that Rahul Gandhi's acceptance is increasing
 iske saath hi yah bhi sawaal he ki kya anti inkambency bhi narendra modi ke khilaaf kaam kar rahi he
 The question is also whether Rahul Gandhi will be able to leave behind Narendra Modi in this race for the post of Prime Minister? Aaj Tak, the most reliable news channel of the country, is once again coming up with the mood of the nation
 desh bhar main hajaaron logon ke bich aise kai sawaal lekar ajtak pahunchaa jinke jawaab is chunavi mahakumbh main aap bhi jaananaa chahenge
 One such question was asked in the Mood of the Nation survey
 kya pradhanmantri pad kii daud main arsh se farsh tak pahunch chuke hai jediu netaa or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar?beete paanch saal ke dauraan hue kai raajnneetik survey main paaya gaya ki 2016-17 ke dauraan nitish kumaar desh ke agle pradhanmantri kii daud main aage the
 Although he consistently lagged behind Rahul Gandhi, his presence at the third position was not keeping him out of the race
 lekin 2017 ke ant main nitish ne jaise hi lalu prasad yadav kaa daaman choda unki lokapriyata dhoomil ho gai
 Know what Aajtak's mood of the nation 2019 also says on this question
 mood of di nesan main ajtak ne yah bhi jaananaa chaha ki abtak koun desh ke sabase lokapriy pradhanmantri rahaa he? beete lagbhag ek dashak main jab yah sawaal poocha gaya to sheersh par purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi rahi hai or mahaj kuch maukon par hi vah is paaydaan se neeche dekhi gai hai
 'mood of the Nation' will tell you, has he gained so much popularity after the first term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he is in a position to beat Indira Gandhi? Is Modi going to beat Indira as the country's most popular Prime Minister? In the opinion of the country, where are the former Prime Ministers Jawaharlal Nehru, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Rajiv Gandhi standing in the race of popularity relative to these two figures? atal sarkaar main vitt mantri raheyashwanth sinhake lekh ke baad modi sarkaar par vipakshi dal chautarafa hamalaa kar rahe hai
 Congress today press conference and attacked the government sharply over the economy
 congress netaa or purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne kaha ki, " yashavanth sinha ne modi sarkaar ko jo sachai kaa aaina dikhaaya, vah congress har din dikhaa rahi he
 Industries are at a standstill, there is no jobs and people are getting upset
 bhaajapa ke dwaara arthvyavastha se khilwaad kaa khamiyaaza puraa desh bhugat rahaa he
 "he further said that," The burden of demonetisation and GST has now fallen on the shoulders of the public

 internet par video aayaa he jisamen Galaxy S8ke saamne photo rakhkar analock kar diya gaya
 That is, by scanning the face of the person whose facial recognition was locked, the phone was unlocked by placing a photo of it
 Galaxy Note7 ke flop hone ke baad jaahir Galaxy S8 samsung ke liye kisi test kam nahin he
 In such a situation, when there will be such a mistake in the Galaxy S8, then it is possible that users will definitely have some disappointment
 agar video me sachai he, to jaahir he yah samsung ke liye badi chunauti hogi
 Because at the time of launching, Samsung said it was Secure and Safe

 Galaxy S8 unlocked in two to three trials
 haalanki samsung yah mana he ki facial ricognishansicurity feechar nahin he, balki ise home screen ke sline analock kii tarah diya gaya he
 a company spokesperson has said, 'facial recognition is a simple way to unlock the phone in the same way as the swipe to unlock feature', according to the company, the Galaxy S8 has fingerprint and Iris scanners for strong security
 bhale hi samsung facial ricognishan ko security feechar nahin kah rahi ho, lekin is video se yah saaf he ki yah feechar flop ho jayega
 It is possible that this will be fixed in the coming years with new updates

 But if this is the case then why was CBI arrested by another part of the government? yadi raja ne kuch bhi galat nahin kiya to unhen kyon giraftaar kiya gaya

 It was a dream for anyone to enter Bollywood during Lata's time
 us dauraan jin baaki singrs ne bollywood main apni jagah banaai wo naa to zyada gane ga pain naa hin bada mukaam hi hasil kar pain
 It is also said that Lata's sister Asha Bhosleka also had to make a lot of papad to make her mark
 vaise to donon kalakaaron ne ek khaas mukaam hasil kiya or donon kaa kariyar safal rahaa he
 But from time to time, there have been reports of competition in both
 50 ke dashak se hi lata kaa jaadu logon ke dilon main chaane laga tha
 Lata carved her own niche in spite of the known singers like Noor Jahan, Shamshad Begum and Geeta Dutt
 wo bahut jald hi top singrs main shumaar ho gayi
 Gradually, she became the voice of many big actors on screen
 unke gane darshakon ke dil main jagah banane lage
 While on one hand Lata was climbing the stairs of success, on the other hand her sister Asha was struggling to make her mark in Bollywood
 kuch ko to yah bhi kahana he ki lata kii vajah se aashaa ko vah mukaam nahin mil paaya jisaki wo hakdaar thim
 There are many other singers who are said to have been unable to find the right place because of Lata
 panditjwahar laal nehruke saamne lata ne jab 'i mere vatan ke logon' gaaya to pandit ji bhi apane aasuun nahin roak paae
 But very few people know that once this song Collata and Ashaon were going to sing together
 magar kisi kaaran se baad main ise sirf lata ne gaaya
 There is also a contraption about this
 donon ke prashansak varg main ise lekar apane apane kalakaar ke paksh main kisse maujuud hai
 But the real thing was never clearly revealed
 vaise donon bahanon ne bollywood main aisi jagah banaai ki nae singron kii raah kaaphi kathin ho gai
 Interestingly, in the 50s, 60s and 70s, competition was just between Lata and Asha
 iskaa asar donon kii personal life main bhi padaa
 It is said that at that time the singer who used to leave Mangeshkar used to go to the bag
 aashaa ne varsetyle singing ke balboote par apni pahchaan banaai
 Film directors also helped both in their own way
 jahaan ek taraf lata kaa kariyar sanvaarane main si
 Ramachandra's name is taken, on the other hand, OP Nayyar played an important role in Asha's career
 aashaa ne wo sabhi sammaan darshakon se paaya jo lata ko mila
 With this, his family life was also full of ups and downs
 lata ke bharat ratna milane or aashaa ko naa die jane par bhi kaaphi controvarsi ho chuki he
 Asha herself has clearly stated in many interviews that i was favored
 tulanaayen hoti rahengi
 People will also keep talking in various ways
 kai kisse vivaad banakar ubharen yaa haashie par chale jaaen
 What is worthwhile is that both of them have immortalized dozens of songs with their voices

 In the night, Baba did the ritual, Baba gave milk to the woman and her husband and gave each medicine
 peedit mahila ne bataaya ki raat ko uskaa pati kamare se baahar so gaya or wo ashram main rahane vaali sevika kamare ke andar so gaye
 Baba Ranbir Das suddenly came into the room at night and started molesting him and said that if the child wants, everything has to be done
 itnaa kehane ke baad baba ne uske sathrapakia
 The woman threatened to kill her husband when she protested, saying that when she tried to make a noise, she was threatened that if she told anyone about it, her husband would be killed
 mahila ne bataaya ki agle din ve apane ghar aa gaye
 According to the victim, due to fear, she did not tell her husband at first, but later she dared to tell the whole thing to her husband
 uske pati ne police main baba or ashram kii sevika ke khilaaf shikaayat darj karwaai
 Announcing self-immolation for not getting justice, the husband of the woman said that no action was taken against Baba even after reporting to the police and the police was not taking his complaint seriously

 The husband said that calls were also coming to him from Neyola village to compromise
 peeditake pati ne bataaya ki use nyaay chahie
 They say that if they do not get justice, they will both commit self-immolation, which will be the responsible administration
 hiraasat main liya gaya baba, sevika faraaravahin ab maamla media main aane baad police harakat main ai he
 Despite the complaint lodged with the police for the last four days, no action was being taken, but after taking cognizance of the media, the police have now taken Baba into custody from his ashram
 police kaa kahana he ki unhen shikaayat mili thi ki baba ne ek mahila se rape kiya he, jiske chalate baba ko hiraasat main liya he or aage baba se poochtacha kii jaaegi
 At present, the servant is still out of the police custody

 HIV AIDS, a disease caused by unprotected sex, is a big challenge for India, but the Modi government's plan to deal with it is slightly different
 kendriya swasthya mantri dow
 Harshavardhana says that to overcome this disease, the government should emphasize on the propagation of Indian culture rather than promoting the use of condoms
 america akhbaar 'da neuyork times' ko die intervyuu main swasthya mantri ne yah baat kahkar sambhavit vivaad ko janm de diya he
 He said he would like to promote 'honest physical relations between husband and wife', which is part of Indian culture, to overcome HIV-AIDS
 ''condom ke prachaar se jaataa he galat sandesh'beemaari par baat karte karte swasthya mantri vaigyaniktaa kaa daaman chhod 'naitikta' kaa paath padhaane lage
 Harsh Vardhan told the US newspaper, "promoting the use of condom goes the wrong message and every kind of relationship that is made with its use seems to be justified
 isliye aids campan kaa jor sirf condom ke istemaal par nahin hona chahie
 'remember that Harshvardhan himself is a doctor of ENT (nose-ear-throat) and practices privately in Delhi

 Significantly, in 1986, the first case of HIV-AIDS was reported in India
 ek samay to yah dar tha ki kahin yah africa kii tarah yahaan bhi mahamari kaa rup na le le

 There are 21 lakh people in the grip of HI V
 The head of the organization, Subbaraj, says that it would not be right to stop promoting condom use in high risk groups
 unhone kaha, 'atisamvedansheel samooh ke logon ko ham naitikta kaa paath nahin padhaa sakate
 'there is full support from the government and UN units in AIDS prevention work in India

 At least 50 people were injured in the double train accident in Malda in West Bengal, but there is confusion over the death toll

 There is also a difference in how the second incident happened after the first accident

 According to Baba Ramdev, economists are not the only ones who have come to study economics from Cambridge or Howard University
 yaa phir mumbai yaa dilli kii badi attalikaon main rahete hai
 According to Baba Ramdev, the common citizen of the country is also an economist
 jo paise kamanaa jaanata he or use kharch va bachat karnaa bhi jaanata he

 unhone kaha ki yoga maatr ek asana nahin he
 Yoga is a whole life system
 unke mutabik pranayam or dhyaan to kisi bhi umr kaa koi bhi vyakti kar saktaa he
 How many asanas come to someone is not very important
 balki bharat mata kii raksha or uskaa mastak ooncha karnaa zyada mahatvapurn he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is doing this work

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has been a great advocate of ending the VIP culture of leaders

 What is the new proposal? Transport Minister Gadkari proposes that the facility of red light should be provided only to the President, Vice President, Prime Minister, Chief Justice of Supreme Court and Speaker of Lok Sabha, whereas in the states, it is Chief Minister, Governor, Chief Justice of High Court and Speaker of the Legislative Assembly
 Be for ganakari ne raishumaari ke liye rajnath singh, arun jetali, sushamaa swaraj sahit kai mantriyon ko ye prastaav bheja he
 According to the order of the Supreme Court of Red Light, the Supreme Court order of 2013, only those who are in constitutional positions can put red lights, but they cannot play sirens
 syran or batti lagane kaa adhikaar sirf unheen ko he jo apataseva se jude hai - sena, police, fire brigade or ambulance
 However, it is instructed that the siren should be very mild
 bahut tej to bilkul nahin hona chahie - logon ko usase koi pareshaani nahin honi chahie
 Who can install the red light: Like the President, Prime Minister at the Center, there is a provision for the use of red lights in the state as well as specific persons with their equivalent constitutional posts, like the Governor and the Chief Minister
 flashar ke saath:raashtrapati, up raashtrapati, pradhanmantri, purv raashtrapati, purv pradhanmantri, up pradhanmantri, mukhya nyaayadhish or supreme court ke jaj, lok sabha spikar, kendriya cabinet mantri, yojana ayog ke upaadhyaksh [modi sarkaar ne yojana ayog kii jagah niti ayog bana diya he], lok sabha or rajya sabha main vipaksh ke netaa
 Without Flasher: Chief Election Commissioner, Union Minister of State and Deputy Minister, Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha, Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha, Member of Planning Commission [planning Commission no longer in existence, Attorney General, Cabinet Secretary, Head of Services and Ex-officio Chief of Staff, CAT, Chairman of UPSC, Minority Commission and SC-ST Commission
 kuch khaas hidaayatenviipi dwaara gaadi istemaal na kiye jane kii sthiti main laal batti kaale rang ke cover se dhaki honi chahie
 The rule is that the red light can only be used during official travel, not during personal travel
 yani agar laal batti ke liye adhikrut vyakti kisi rishtedaar se milane ja rahaa he yaa phir kahin lunch yaa dinar karne jaae us sthiti main laal batti cover se dhaki honi chahie
 The Supreme Court has strictly curbed the misuse of red light
 phir bhi siyaasi rasookh kaa sabase bada states simbel - kai hastiyon ke liye ab shaayad ye kuch hi dinon kaa mehmaan he
 If the new proposal is approved, then there will be only 9 posts in the country, whose red light will shine on the trains

 Regardless of whether you make a statement in words or not, but how you sleep with your partner reveals the depth of your relationship
 jaahir he ki har kapal kaa saath sone kaa ek unic style hota he
 You would be surprised to know that every position has a meaning
 to ab gaur kijiega ki aapkaa partner kya style pasand karata he, or uske aadhaar par jaaniye ki aapke partner ke man main rishte kii kya ahmiyat he
 In this position, a person sleeps directly on his back
 or doosraa partner pehle vaale ke seene par sar rakhkar sota he
 Sleeping with your partner's shoulder or chest on your head shows dependence on one another
 ye style ek duusare ke liye imotional dependesi darshata he
 In this position, a person sleeps on either side with a sideways, and his partner sleeps from the back, embracing him in the direction of the same side
 aamtaur par relationships kii shuruyaat main ye pojishan kaaphi kaaman rahati he
 The partner who hugs from behind is usually more loving
 ye pojishan relationships kii shuruyaat main sabase adhik kareebi darshaati he
 In this, one partner sleeps in a straight posture on the back, and the other comes over and hugs him
 ye kaaphi intimet pojishan he or lav mekking kaa best tarika he
 This style is found more in the old pairs
 donon partner ek duusare kii taraf peeth karke sote hai yaa alag-alag karavat lekar
 It has nothing to do with lack of love
 balki ye is maansikta ko darshata he ki donon partner kahin na kahin aatmanirbharta talash rahe hai
 This position looks as if two bodies have been joined by tying knots on the strength of hands and feet
 is pojishan main agar partner jaldi alag ho jate hai to wo kahin na kahin self-dependency talash rahe hai
 And if it is not, then understand that love is very deep

 bijepi ke pradhanmantri pratyaashee ne kaha ki maine akhabaaron main padhaa ki ek mahila yuvak congress netaa gaayab ho gai or baad main uskaa shav mila
 Youth leaders of your party were arrested in connection with this incident

 (input-ieenes) Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra may contest from Varanasi against PM Modi
 enditivi ko sutara ke hawaale se khabar mili he ki varanasi se piem modi ke khilaafpriyanka gandhi kechunaav ladane kii sambhaavna he
 April 29 is the last date for nomination to contest from the Varanasi Lok Sabha seat
 congress ke kareebi sutara ne enditivi se kaha ki varanasi se chunaav ladgaye par priyanka gandhi ne hami bhar di he, lekin antim faisla rahul gandhi ko karnaa he
 However, earlier Rahul Gandhi had indicated that we want to keep you in suspense in this matter
 lagata he ki ab vah suspence khatm hone vaala he
 Not only this, Priyanka Gandhi has no avoiding having two hands with PM Modi
 priyanka ko is baat kii bhi parvaah nahin he ki varanasi ke kya parinaam honge
 Congress workers believe that ever since Priyanka has been given charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh, there is tremendous enthusiasm among the Congress workers and if Priyanka Gandhi contests from Varanasi, it will affect the entire eastern Uttar Pradesh
 congress ko yah ummid he ki priyanka ke chunaav ladane se vaise congressi bhi baahar niklenge, jo abhi tak gharon main baith gaye the
 Whenever Priyanka Gandhi was asked about contesting elections, she said that she is ready in every way
 yahaan tak ki ravivaar ko unase varanasi se chunaav ladane ko poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki agar party kahegi to main taiyaar hum
 Even before this, there has been talk of Priyanka contesting the election, but the name was coming from Rae Bareli seat
 yah kaha ja rahaa tha ki agar sonia kii tabiyat thik nahin hoti he to priyanka raibareli se ladengi
 But now Sonia Gandhi has filled the form from Rae Bareli
 pichley dinon jab priyanka gandhise sawaal kiya gaya ki kya vah varanasi main piem modi ke khilaaf chunaav ladengi, to unhone kaha tha, maine lagaataar kaha he ki main vahi karuungi, jo party mujhase karne ke liye kahegi
 If the Congress President asks her to contest elections, she will fight
 'rahul gandhi se sidhaa sawaal poocha gaya tha ki kya unki bahan priyanka gandhi varanasi se chunaav ladengi to unhone jawaab diya, 'aap khud andaja lagaaie
 Guess is not always wrong
 ' jab rahul gandhi se phir poocha gaya ki kya aap isse inkaar nahin kar rahe to unhone kaha, 'main naa isaki pushti kar rahaa hum or naa hi inkaar kar rahaa hum
 'after this Bhumihars are 1 lakh 25 thousand, Rajput 1 lakh, Patel 2 lakh, Chaurasia 80 thousand, Dalit 80 thousand and other backward castes are 70 thousand
 inke vot agar thodaa bahut bhi idhar-udhar hote hai to seat kaa ganit badal saktaa he
 After watching this game of statistics, if there is talk of partnership and if the caste equation is supported then Priyanka Gandhi can compete with Modi
 haalanki modi ne jis tarah se pichley saadhe chaar saalon main varanasi main vikaas ke jo kaam kiya he kya use najrandaaj kiya ja saktaa he, yah bhi apane aap main ek bada sawaal he
 But if Priyanka contests the elections from Varanasi, the Congress will succeed in a big message in Uttar Pradesh before the defeat

 There are many practices of worship in Hinduism
 isamen saakaar or niraakaar donon kii upasna kii jaati hai
 Idol worship is said to have special significance in the worship of the real God
 saakaar brahm kii upasna bina murti yaa pratik ke nahin ho sakati he
 Let us know how long idol worship has been in vogue in Hinduism and what kind of idol should be chosen for worship
 hindu dharm main murti kabase prachlan main he-vaidic kaal or baad main murti puja kaa koi sakshya nahin miltaa he
 Although Indra is definitely mentioned in the Mahabharata
 sabase pehle hadappa kii khudaai main pashupati kii murti ke pramaan milte hai
 Subsequently, idol worship became increasingly prevalent due to convenience and support
 murti puja kii jarurat kya he-vyakti kaa man atyadhik chanchal or nakaaratmak hota he
 a base is used to concentrate the mind and the idol is used for attaching oneself and concentration
 murti puja se chizein thodi asana or bhavatmak ho jaati hai
 How to choose an idol? - Use a small idol for house worship
 - yah chah inch tak kii ho to behatar hoga
 - If the idol of the deity is in the posture of blessing, it is good
 - murti thik se bani hui ho or sundar honi chahie
 -do not use idols of war posture or sleep posture
 ghar main murti laane se pehle baraten ye saavdhaaniyaan-- murtiyon mitti kii hi hon to uttam hota he
 - When the idols become old or the form becomes bad, immerse them
 -nadiyon main visarjan kii jagah murtiyon ko mitti main bhi dabaa sakate hai
 -do not consider Murthi Puja as the last worship nayaa saal aa gaya he

 If Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar does anything, there is definitely a purpose behind it
 yah baat khud unhone somvaar ko maani
 He said that when he had gone to the former Union Finance Minister p Chidambaram to leave Sadaqat Ashram in Patna from Rajgir, he hoped that Bihar would get special state status
 nitish kumaar se somvaar ko jab yah poocha gaya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kaa vaada kiya tha or nitish bhi is mudde par sabase mukhar rahe hai, to unka kahana tha ki sabase pehle ye sarvadaleey maang he
 a resolution from the Legislative Assembly has also been passed in this regard
 haalanki nitish ne saath-saath yah bhi kah daalaa ki 2013 main jab us samay ke kendriya vitt mantri pi chidambaram rajgir aae the tab unka helicopter karaab hone par unhen ve apni gaadi main bithakar laae the
 He hoped that special state status would be attained
 lekin us samay jo is mudde par samiti bani thi usne ise lataka diya
 Nitish said that if the UPA government wanted, it could have given special status to Bihar
 nitish ke jawaab se saaf he ki ve philhal is mudde ko zyada tool nahin dena chaahate
 However, before the Bihar assembly elections, he always satirized Prime Minister Narendra Modi to fulfill his promise

 Salman Khan has already spent 5 years in jail in the black deer hunting case in Jodhpur Central Jail
 ab unke vakeelon kii puri koshish hogi ki unhen aaj jodhpur seshan court se jamaanat mil jaae
 The lawyers had tried their best to get Salman bail after the CJM court's decision on Thursday
 guuruuvaar ko hi seshan court main salmaan kii jamaanat ke liye yachika daayar kar di gai thi, lekin seshan court ne shuukravaar ko sunwaayee kaa faisla liya
 As a result, Salman had to be lodged in the Jodhpur Central Jail on Thursday night
 ab sabhi kii nigahen aaj seshan court par hongi or salmaan ke fain besabri se intjaar kar rahe hai ki unke chahete sitare ko bel milti he yaa nahin
 Surprising on the sentence awarded to Salman Khan, his lawyer on Thursday said that the court's decision seemed as if Salman Khan had gone out hunting alone
 lekin sijeem court par salmaan ke vakeelon kii ek daleel nahin chali or unhen doshi qaraar dete hue sajaa suna di gai
 According to Salman's lawyer Anand Desai, 10 this morning on the sessions court bail plea
 30 baje sunwaayee karegi
 He has expressed full confidence that Salman will get bail from the sessions court
 unka kahana tha ki CJM court kaa faisla isliye hairaani bharaa he, kyonki rajasthan hoicourt ne jin sabooton or saakshyon ke aadhaar par salmaan ko bari kar diya tha, CJM court ne unheen sabooton or gavaahon ke aadhaar par yah sajaa kaa faisla sunaaya he
 At the same time, the judge of the CJM Court, Devkumar Khatri, while delivering the verdict, said that 'the accused is a well-known artist
 jiske dwaara kiye gaye kaaryon kaa aam janata dwaara bhi anusaran kiya jaataa he
 Despite this, the accused have hunted two wildlife deer
 'apane faisle main jaj khatri ne salmaan khan se jude hit and ran cese kaa bhi zikr kiya
 He said, 'two other cases of deer hunting were also registered on the accused earlier
 mulgim par ek anya prakaran hit and ran cese kaa bombai main hua tha
 Muljim hunted Krishna deer with handmade episodes for hobbies
 ' Former Chief Minister and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has been taunted by Nitish Kumar for providing z plus security to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 unhone kaha ki 2 maheene pehle tak nitish kumaar unke pita or argedy supremeo lalu prasad kii jed plus suraksha ko lekar pravachan de rahe the, lekin ab vah khud jed plus suraksha ke ghere main rahenge
 It is worth mentioning that in the month of November last year, the Central Government reduced the z Plus security given to Lalu and provided him with z category security
 us vakt nitish kumaar ne twit kar lalu ke zyada suraksha ke ghere main rahane ko lekar tanj ksaa tha or kaha tha ki vah logon par rob jhaadne ke liye zyada suraksha ke ghere main rahete hai
 Taking a dig at Nitish on Saturday, Tejashwi said that a few days ago, the ultimate political saint and security promoter who gave a discourse on security up to four people, should tell what sensation he wants to achieve by taking z plus security? Surprised about the fact that the international security promoter (nitish) was giving full knowledge on Lalu's security to the entire country on 28 November and while he Sector Alliance breakdown of 5 days after the Narendra Modi government on August 1, gave applications to provide the Z-plus security
 tejasvi ne kaha ki nitish kii ajab-gajab palati maar charitrik visheshgyata par shodh hona chahie
 Tejashwi further taunted the Chief Minister, saying that despite the Bihar government's z Plus security and 350 SSG personnel, 20 brand new SUV trains, demanding z plus security from the center, Bihar building in Delhi itself and Bihar residence besides one Taking separate accommodation is a sign of very simple, reclusive, liberated, lonely and very courageous personality

 bijepi or ajasu ke bich seat shering formula tay na hone ke chalate ab donon dal alag-alag chunavi maidan main taal thonkege
 However, no formal announcement has been made by either party
 alabatta bijepi ne saaf kar diya he ki ageesu kii maang har roj bad rahi he, jise puraa karnaa asambhav he
 AJSU chief Sudesh Mahato had demanded 17 seats in the assembly elections this time
 lekin bijepi mahaj 9 siten hi dena chaahati thi
 Sudesh Mahato had met the bjp's top leadership, yet the seat sharing formula could not come out
 saal 2014 main raghuvar das sarkaar ko banavaane main ageesu kaa ahm bhoomika rahi he
 In the last election, BJP and AJSU contested the elections together
 bijepi 72 seat par chunaav ladakar 37 siten jiti thi or ageesu 8 siton par chunavi taal thokar 5 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 In this way, the BJP could not reach the majority figure on its own, after which AJSU formed a government in the state
 bataa den ki ageesu ne ek seat se apni siyaasi yatra shuru kii thi
 The only AJSU MLA elected to the Bihar Legislative Assembly was Sudesh Kumar Mahato
 iske baad saal 2000 main jharkhand banane ke baad bijepi kii sarkaar bani to sudesh mahato ne samarthan dekar jud gaye
 Since then, as many BJP governments were formed in Jharkhand, AJSU remained a partner
 kyon tut gaya gathbandhansudesh mahato apanaaraajanneetik aadhaar jharkhand main badhanachahte hai
 At the same time, the big faces of many opposition parties who are running angry are knocking at the door of AJSU
 isi ke chalate sudesh mahato ne apni siton kii demand badha di he
 There has been a lot of politics in Jharkhand in the last five years
 ageesu 2014 main jin siton par jiti thi or jahaan wo duusare sthaan par rahi thi, un siton par daavedaari karne ke saath-saath simriya, sindri, mandu or chakradhrpur seat bhi maang rahi thi
 BJP consistently rejected ajsu's claim and AJSU stood firm on its demand
 chandankiyaari par ageesu ne daavedaari kaa aadhaar 2009 or 2014 ke nattejey ko banaaya tha
 Umakant Rajak won from AJSU in 2009 and finished second in 2014
 udhar, amar kumaar bouri ke jeviem se baghawat kar bijepi main shaamil ho gaye hai
 In such a situation, BJP was demanding this seat, which AJSU did not agree to
 aise hi lohardaga seat par bhi pech fansaa hua tha, 2014 main is seat ko ageesu ke camel kishor bhagat jite the, lekin baad main vah sajayaftaa ho gaye
 In this by-election, Sukhdev Bhagat of Congress won
 chunaav se pehle unhone bijepi kaa daaman tham liya he or party ne tikat dekar maidan main utaar diya he
 At the same time, bjp's state Laxman from Chakradharpur assembly has been fielded in Giluamaidan, while AJSU did not want to leave this seat under any circumstances
 isi ke chalate rishte main kadavaahat paidaa ho gai or 19 saal puraani dosti lagbhag tut gai he
 How many seats did the BJP-AJSU contested and the BJP and AJSU may have formed a government together in 2000, but the elections were fought in 2014
 iske alaava donon ne jitne bhi chunaav hue hai, sab main alag-alag kismat aajamaai thi
 In the 2005 assembly elections, BJP contested 63 seats and won 30 seats
 jabaki, ageesu 40 siton par ladakar do siten jiti thi
 In the 2009 assembly elections, BJP won 18 seats, fighting 67 seats and AJSU won 5 seats by fighting 54 seats
 2014 main bijepi-ageesu ne milakar chunaav ladaa tha
 The BJP won 37 of the 72 seats it contested and AJSU won 5 of the 8 seats it contested
 is tarah se saal 2000 main bana bijepi or ageesu kii dosti kaa kila darak gaya he

 aise massej whatsap par share kiye ja rahe hai or soshal media par bhi aisi khabare hai
 However, the most affected by this ransomware attack is Windows XP, so it can be said that atms running on Windows XP will be upgraded, so they will remain closed
 sutron ne kaha ki zyaadaatar atm badhia tareeke se kaam kar rahe hai
 Some may not have the updated Microsoft Windows operating system
 sutron ne kaha ki is tarah ke atm par hamale kii sambhaavna ban sakati he

 ) idi, police, paisa, dhak ke dam par banani padegi sarkaaridi kaa ek pratinidhi ko mantrimandal main shaamil karnaa hogashivsena ne ek baar phir se bijepi par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 The Shiv Sena has made serious allegations against the BJP in its mouthpiece Saamana over the continuing plight of the CM post in the formation of the new coalition government
 shivasena ne likhaa ki bijepi ko idi, police, paisa, dhak ke dam par anya partiyon ke vidhayak todakar sarkaar banani padegi
 Shiv Sena wrote in the face- "the election result of Maharashtra is clear
 bhartiya janata party ko 105 siten milin
 Had Shiv Sena not been there, the figure would not have crossed 75
 ‘yuti’ thi isliye gati mili
 Instead of the number of seats it had when 'yuti', what was the agreement made during 'yuti' before the election is important
 shivasena ko 56 siten milin lekin shri fadanvis pehle nirdhaarit sharton ke anuroop shivasena ko dhai saal mukhyamantri pad dene ko taiyaar nahin hai
 bjp's Devendra Fadnavis, despite the evidence of similar distribution of posts being spoken on record, retaliates and is showing clemency to form the government with the help of Police, CBI, ED, Income Tax Department
 ye loktantr kaa koun-sa udhaaharan he?""indira gandhi ne apatkaal lagaaya us din ko kaala din kahkar sambodhit karne vaale aise kyon ban gaye hai
 It is surprising
 24 taarikh ko chunaav parinaam ghoshit hone ke baad usee din mukhyamantri fadanvis ko bade abhimaan se ‘matoshri’ main jaakar pehle charchaa shuru kerani chahie thi
 The atmosphere would not have been tense but the defeat of 105 lotuses means Amarpatta who will snatch it? Like 2014, the Shiv Sena will accept all conditions, all remain under this illusion
 is bhram ko uddhav thakare ne pehle 8 ghanton main dur kar diya
 In 2014, Shiv Sena joined power
 ab shivasena wo jaldbaaji nahin dikhaaegi tathaa ghutane techne nahin jaaegi, aisi niti unhone apanaai tathaa vyarth charchaa kaa darwaja band kar diya
 "click here for registration in Sahitya Aaj Tak" "if there is a majority without the Shiv Sena, then form the government, become the Chief Minister!" Mr
 Uddhav Thackeray gave this direct message
 shri devendra fadanvis ke liye aaj party main koi virdohi athwa mukhyamantri pad kaa daavedaar shesh nahin he
 This is a strange coincidence
 shri gopinath munde aaj hote to maharashtra kaa drishy alag dikhaa hota tathaa munde mukhyamantri ban hi gaye hote to yuti main aaj jaisi katutaa nahin dikhi hoti
 Mr
 Munde died
 ekanath khadse ko pehle hi haashie par daalkar khatm kar diya gaya
 Girish Mahajan arranged for this
 ab ‘muktai nagar’ nirvachan kshetra se khadse kii beti ko bhi parajeet kar diya gaya
 Pankaja Munde was defeated
 vinod taavade ko ghar baitha diya gaya tathaa chandrakant patil ko mushkilon main daal diya gaya
 Still Devendra Fadnavis could not form the government and is submitting one independent each but 145 will be collected from this multiplication math
 ”what can happen in Maharashtra under the present circumstances
 ise dekhen-daanv-1: shivasena ko chhodkar bhaajapa sabase badi party hone kii haisiyat se sarkaar banane ke liye daawa pesh kar sakati he
 The BJP has 105 mlas
 40 or kii jarurat padegi
 If this is not possible, the government will collapse during the motion of no confidence and it seems impossible to achieve 40
 daanv-2: varsh 2014 kii tarah rashtravaadi congress party bhartiya janata party ko samarthan degi
 The Nationalist Congress will join the National Democratic Alliance, instead Supriya Sule will be given the post at the Center and Ajit Pawar in the state, but in the year 2014, the terrible mistake Mr
 Pawar will once again make is not even a small possibility
 pavaar ko bhaajapa ke virodh main safalataa mili he or maharashtra ne unhen sir par uthaaya
 Today they are at the peak
 unka yash mitti main mil jayega
 See full coverage of Sahitya Aaj Tak here
 Dain-3: BJP will fail to prove majority in the vote of confidence, then Shiv Sena being the second big party will stake claim to form government
 rashtravaadi 54, congress 44 tathaa anya kii madad se bahumat kaa aankada 170 tak pahunch jayega
 Shiv Sena will be able to become its own Chief Minister and he will have to dare to run the government
 iske liye teen swatantra vichaaron vaali partiyon ko samaan athwa saamanjasy se yojana banaakar aage badhanaa hoga
 The way Atal Bihari Vajpayee ran the government in Delhi, similarly everyone will have to move forward
 isi main maharashtra kaa hit he
 Stake-4: The Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena will have to come together and form a government
 iske liye donon ko hi chaar kadam peeche lene padenge
 The demands of the Shiv Sena will have to be considered
 mukhyamantri pad kaa vibhaajan karnaa hoga or yahi ek behtareen paryaay he parantu ahankaar ke chalate ye sambhav nahin he
 Stake-5: The BJP will have to form a government by breaking the mlas of other parties on the basis of ED, police, money, money etc
 iske liye idi ke ek pratinidhi ko mantrimandal main shaamil karnaa hoga parantu dal badalanewaalon kii kya dasha hui, ise matadaataaon ne dikhaa diya
 It is not easy to get the chief minister's post by splitting the majority
 in sabase modi kii chhavi dhoomil hogi

 Rejecting the petition, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said why the court should hear the case again and again
 CJI ne kaha ki vah is maamle main dakhsandaji nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 Then the Election Commission will go to Opposition: Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Chandrababu Naidu has said that when the Election Commission had not heard of him, he came here, but now he will again go to the Election Commission
 unhone kaha ki teesraa front or chauthaa front sabhi vipaksh kaa hi hissaa he, ham piem ummidavaar kaa naam chunaav ke baad tay karenge
 At the same time, Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that the Election Commission has not issued any rules if there is some error in the results, that is why we came to court
 ab is masale ko lekar vipakshi netaa aaj hi chunaav ayog se mil sakate hai
 The Supreme Court has already ordered the Supreme Court last month, in its ruling, asked to randomly match the slips of evms and vvpats of at least five booths in every assembly constituency
 ayog ne ise maan bhi liya tha
 The Supreme Court increased the matching of EVM and VVPAT five times in this Lok Sabha election

 Currently only one VVPAT is matched
 har vidhansabha kshetra main 5 iviem kii hogi jaanchagauratlab he ki abhi tak chunaav ayog 4125 iviem or vivipat ke milan karaata he jo ab supreme court ke aadesh ke baad badhkar 20625 iviem or vivipat (EVM-VVPAT) kaa milan karnaa hoga
 Currently only one EVM is taken per assembly segment for VVPAT paper slip matching
 ek iviem prati vidhansabha kshetra ke 4125 iviem ke VVPAT papers se milan karaayaa jaataa he
 After the Supreme Court order, the Election Commission has to count VVPAT slips of 20625 evms, that is, five evms will be examined per assembly constituency

 BJP made a plan to conquer Mewat
 In Mewat, the BJP did not get 2 Muslim candidates in 2014
 inhen main se ek ilaaka haryana kaa mevaat he, jahaan modi lahar main bhi bijepi camel nahin khilaa saki thi
 This is the reason why BJP has placed bets on two veteran Muslim leaders to make the political land of Mewat predominantly Muslim and feed lotus in this area
 isamen nunh vidhansabha seat se jakir hossain or ferozepur jhirka kshetra se naseem ahamed ko pratyaashee banaaya he
 BJP has played two bets simultaneously by taking out two Muslim candidates in Haryana
 pehla yah he ki 2 tikaton se yah myth tod diya he ki bijepi muslimon ko kam tikat detii he
 The second is that the Muslim areas where the BJP could not win even after a lot of efforts, want to tie the victory record with the help of Muslim strong leaders
 2014 main mevaat main nahin khulaa tha bijepi kaa khatabata den ki mevaat ilaake main bijepi apni siyaasi jameen ko majboot karne kii kavayad lambey samay se kar rahi he, lekin muslim bahul ilaaka hone ke chalate yahaan vah pair nahin jamaa saki
 The result of this is that in the 2014 assembly elections, only one out of five assembly seats in Mewat region could win
 jabaki teen siten inelo or ek seat nirdaleey ke khate main gai thi
 The three Muslim mlas of Mewat held the BJP Kadaman in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, winning all 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana, but when it was reviewed legally, it was found that the party was behind the Congress and other parties in 11 seats
 ye 11 siten mevaat or jatland kii thim
 That is why the party started hurling Muslim mlas here and it seems to be successful in this strategy as well
 mevaat ilaake ke teen muslim vidhayakon ne bijepi kaa daaman thama tha
 Among them, Zakir Hussain and Nasim Ahmad left the INLD and joined the BJP, which the party has fielded by giving them tickets
 jabaki punhana se nirdaleey vidhayak rahis khan ne bhi bijepi kaa daaman thama tha, par party un par bharosa nahin jataa saki
 The BJP has replaced him with Naukasam Choudhary, who belongs to the Dalit community
 mevaat main muslim matadaata hi kingbijepi nehryana main mishan-75 plus sitenjitne kaa lakshya rakhaa hua he
 Therefore, by giving tickets to Muslims, he has given the message of sabka saath, sabka vikas
 bijepi is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav main mevaat kshetra kii 5 vidhansabha siton ko har haal main jeetna chaahati he
 She is doing everything possible for this
 haryana main muslim matadaata 7
 There are 2 per cent, but Mewat has a Muslim population of around 70 per cent
 mevaat ke nunh, punhana, ferozepur jhirka seat par muslim matadaata nirnaayak bhoomika main he
 Apart from this, Sohna and Hathin play Muslim Kingmakers in the seat
 isamen hathin seat hi bijepi pichhali baar jeet saki thi
 If we talk about the past, only during the Haryana Vikas party-bjp alliance, Kanwar Surajpal Tawadu was able to win the assembly after a lot of hard work
 iske baad se bijepi ke liye yah ilaaka sookhaa rahaa he
 Khattar kindly on Mewat, will the hearts of Muslims be able to win? To increase its base in Mewat, the BJP government has laid the foundation stone for many development projects
 punhana ke rajkeey mahavidhyalay va upmandal adhikari (naagarik) bhawan kaa locarpan, nunh ke laghu sachivalay parisar main circuit house vistaar or emd colony main kaamkaaji mahila hastal ke locarpan ke jariye siem ne logon kaa bharosa jeetne kaa kaam kiya he
 There is a big problem of renewal of drivers' licenses in Mewat, which was also taken by Manohar Lal Khattar
 mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ne kendriya sadak parivahan mantri nitin gadakari se mulaakaat kar driveron ko anivaary shaikshanik yogyata se chhot dene kii maang kii thi
 Khattar had told Gadkari that the license of more than 20,000 drivers of Mewat region is not being renewed due to the mandatory qualification rules
 in driveron ke licenson ke navinikaran or nae vaahan chaalkon ke hit main khatter ne is niyam ko hataane kii maang kii thi
 Khattar's move has increased bjp's graph in Mewat
 aise main dekhnaa he ki unka yah daanv voton main tabdeel hota he yaa nahin

 com / tbvuiabos0— Aakash Chopra (@cricketaakash) April 2, 2017 Ravichandran Ashwin - It's been 6 years since we won the World Cup, the last moments of the game remain fresh in my memory
 What a night that was👌— Ashwin Ravichandran (@ashwinravi99)april 2, 2017cricket prashansak us lamhe ko kabhi nahin bhul paaenge jab captain mahendra singh dhoni ne tej gendbaaj nuan kulasekara ko long on ke upar se chakka markar bharat ko jeet dilaai thi
 After this there was a series of victories for several days
 film kaa naam:tamaashadiarector:imtiyaaj aleestar cast:deepika padukon, ranbir kapur, javed shaikh, nikhil bhagat, faraj sirvaiya, punam singh, piyush mishrivadhi:2 ghanta 31 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga:3 starimtiyaaj ali ne apane filmi kariyar main 'jab ve met', 'lav aaj kal', 'rockstar' jaisi ek se badhkar ek filmein banaai hai or kahin naa kahin wo kahaniyaan darshakon kaa manoranjan bhi karti hai
 This time Imtiaz has tried to present a different kind of love story with Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone, where on the one hand Deepika is at the top of her career, while Ranbir's acting is appreciated in every film but unfortunately his previous Some films have failed
 ab kya imtiyaaj ali kaa 'tamaasha',ranbir- deepikaki jodi, darshakon kaa manoranjan kar paaegi? aaie jaane film samiksha main:kahaneeyah kahani he shimla main rahane vaale veda vardhan saahani (ranbir kapur) kii, jiskaa padhai main jaraa sa bhi man nahin lagata, lekin uske pita (javed shaikh) kii jid he ki veda ganit kii padhai ke saath-saath ejineering bhi karen
 Veda is fond of listening to and telling different kinds of stories
 pita kii baat ko maanate hue apane sapanom ko chhod kar veda job karne lagata he, usee bich tara maheshwari (deepika padukon) se mulaakaat ke baad veda ke bheetar apane sapanom ko sach karne kii aashaa jaag uthati he
 The two meet on a trip to Corsica (france) and flirt with each other with different types of film dialogues
 phir tara ko lagata he ki kahin use veda se pyaar naa ho jaae, isliye wo corsika chhodkar bharat waapas aa jaati he lekin ek baar phir se veda or tara kii mulaakaat dilli main hoti he or phir kahani chal padati he
 a lot of fight fights take place between Veda and Tara, due to which this relationship starts going elsewhere, now is this journey successful? Will Ved and Tara's love story succeed or will laila-majnu be like Heer Ranjha? You will get the answer only by watching the film
 scriptfilm kii ek tag line he 'why always The same story? or kahani ko alag banane ke chakkar main imtiyaaj ne ek alag tarah kaa prayog kiya he
 The characters of Veda and Tara are well written but the rest of the story could have been even better
 film kii shuruyaat main bachapan ke veda or uski kalpanaaon ko aakhir tak pahunchaa paane main imtiyaaj sakasham ho paae hai lekin bich-bich main kahani kaaphi khinchati jaati he, jise or chota kiya ja saktaa tha
 With such good locations and great actors, the story of the film would have been crisp, it would have been called a compliment
 abhinayadipika auraranbirne kaaphi sahaj tareeke se abhinay kiya he
 Humor, Raudra, Karun and Shringar are all four in this film, which has been done 100 percent by acting Deepika and Ranbir
 kuch aise seen hai jahaan alfaaz to nahin hai lekin chehre ke bhav dekhakar hi hansi aa jaati he to kahin bheetar kaa gam bhi baahar nikalataa he
 Piyush Mishra and Vivek Mushran as boss have also done fine
 sangitafilmaka sangeet plot ke hisaab se sahi he or gaanon kii vajah se film main nikhaar bhi aata he
 Songs like 'matargashti', 'agar Tum Saath Ho', 'heer' are already very much liked
 e
 r Rahman's music and Irshad Kamil's alphas are really like filling in the ears
 kamjor kadifilm kii kamjor kadi isaki script he jo kahin-kahin bich main apni pakad khoti najar aati he
 The script could have been a bit more crisp
 flash back or haal philhal main chal rahi kahani main doharaav kai jagah par najar aata he
 Why see if you are a fan of the oparanbir-deepikaki duo and their acting , as well as if you agree with Imtiaz Ali's films, then watch Tamasha
 bijepi netaa arun jetali ne amritsar main apni haar se yah kahkar ubarne kaa prayaas kiya ki yah loksabhaa chunaavon main bijepi kii abhootpurv jeet ke bich samudr main ek boond kii tarah he
 When asked about his future plans, Jaitley said that he would play the same role as the party thought fit for him
 jetali bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ke kaaphi kareeb samajhe jate hai
 Jaitley said, i have no priority
 agar mujhase santhnik kaary karne ko kaha gaya, to main bahut khush hounga
 Asked whether he was saying that he would not be part of the Modi cabinet, he said, he is not making any suggestions
 unhone kaha, koi bhi abhi us kshan kii nahin soch rahaa he
 The party will look at the entire situation in totality
 jetali ne punjab ke purv mukhyamantri amarinder singh se apni haar ke liye sthaneey karkon ko jimmedaar bataaya
 It was a challenging seat, we always knew
 aisa lagata he ki kuch sthaneey kaarak hai, jo pratikul prabhaav paidaa kar rahe hai
 
 
 There were some local factors, but we thought we would overcome them
 jetali ne kaha, jab aap nahin jitate hai, tab hameshaa hi niraashaa hoti he
 i am so happy with the bjp's victory that my own victory looks like a drop in the sea
 isliye isse vastav main koi fark nahin padataa
 He said that he had congratulated Amarinder Singh on his decisive victory and tried to minimize the sharp tip between them by saying that without them election campaigning becomes boring
 amarinder singh ne jetali ko ek lakh se adhik maton se haraaya
 He denied reports about Sushma Swaraj's unhappiness and said that the media was harsh towards her

 chidambaram ne kaha ki aatanrik suraksha ke mudde par baatcheet bharat or america sambandhon main mile kaa pathar sabit hogi

 chidambaram ne kaha ki desh aatankwaadiyon kii ghuspaith or jaali mudra pravaah jaisi samasyaon se jujh rahaa he, jo sirf pashchimi seemaa kii taraf se hi nahin, balki un deshon kii taraf se bhi ho rahaa he, jinase hamaari khuli simaaen hai
 Chidambaram said, having a stable, peaceful and prosperous neighborhood is very important for the security of the country

 Apni Apni kismat The excitement about Dubai's camel Shaheen is almost over in the football world! Shaheen has also taken a hat-trick of wrong predictions among the predictions of successive wrongs
 buudhvaar ko shaheen ne bhavishyavaanee kii thi ki spain or chile ke match main jeet spain kii hogi
 The Spanish team not only lost but also had to drop out of the World Cup
 spain fifa world cap kaa maujuuda champion he
 After four accurate predictions, Shaheen's persistent wrong predictions have eradicated the enthusiasm of sports fans for this camel! Contrary to Shaheen's prediction, Dubai's camel bets on Spain also proved to be a loss deal after the draw between Mexico and Brazil and the defeat of Portugal

 Shaheen has placed bets on England, but sports fans are assuming that this prediction of Shaheen will also prove to be wrong
 vaise sahi or galat bhavishyavaaniyon ko lekar shaheen kaa score abhi 3-4 he
 Watch the video of Shaheen's latest prophecy- america ne apane nagarikon ko pakistan main jari sampradayik hamalon samet aatankwaadi hinsa ke maddenjar vahaan kii gaiyr jaruri yatra nahin karne kii chetavanee di he
 The Foreign Ministry has said this in a recent travel alert related to Pakistan
 isse pehle pichley saal 28 agast ko yatra paraamarsh jari kiya gaya tha
 The foreign ministry, a threat to the terrorist group US citizens, said, "pakistan continues to have large-scale terrorist violence, including communal attacks

 karnataka ke purv mukhyamantri esaem krishna ne congress party se apane rishte todane kaa aupchaarik elaan kuch din pehle hi kar diya tha
 Now reports of his joining BJP are coming
 is baaren bijepi netaa or purv mukhyamantri bies yediurppa ne kaha ki vah (krishna) bhartiya janata party ke sadsy banenge
 Earlier, Krishna had said that the manner in which he was suddenly removed from the post of foreign minister during upa-2's tenure was disgraceful
 unhone indira gandhi or rajeev gandhi ke saath kaam kiya tha
 At least they could have been called and said farewell in a respectful manner which did not happen
 isse vah kaaphi niraash the
 Speaking to the media last Saturday, Krishna had informed that i had written a letter to Congress President Sonia Gandhi that he wanted to leave the party
 pichley saal 2016 main cabinet vistaar ke baad jab mukhyamantri siddharmaiya ke khilaaf congress ke andar baghawat ke sur tej the tab aisa kaha jaataa he ki congress haicmand ne unase sampark saadhaa tha taaki virodh ko dabaaya ja sake
 It is said that Krishna then tried to present himself as the Chief Minister
 tab se esaem krishna or congress ke kendriya netritv ke bich faasla or bad gaya tha
 However, this news was never confirmed by SM Krishna
 is bich krishna ne apane nem plate main bhi badlaav kar liya he
 Earlier there was only one a at the end of Krishna, now two A's were seen in its place
 puche jane par krishna ne kaha ki unhone yah qadam 'kicks" yani tezi se kamyaabi kii seedhiyaan langhane ke liye uthaaya he
 The comments krishna ek samay main kaaphi lokapriy the, lekin 84 saal kii is umr main ab vah pakad badale hue rajanithik parivesh main kamazor pade hai
 His personal relations with Deve Gowda are not very reliable, so it is believed that he will join the BJP in the future
 bhale hi esaem krishna kii pakad vokaligga voters par pehle jaisi majboot na ho lekin mysore mandya kshetra kii taqariban aadha darjan vidhansabha kshetron main haar jeet ke bich nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaane kii haisiyat rakhte hai

 Krishna was quite popular at one time, but at this age of 84 years, now he is weak in the changed political environment
 devegoda se unke nijee sambandh bahut bharosemand nahin hai, aise main bijepi se bhavishya main vah naata jodenge aisa mana ja rahaa he
 Even though SM Krishna's hold on the Vokaligga voters is not as strong as it was before, but in almost half a dozen assembly constituencies in the Mysore Mandya region, he has a decisive role to play
