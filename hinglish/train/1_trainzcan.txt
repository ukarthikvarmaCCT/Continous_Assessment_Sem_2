 The full moon of the Shukla Paksha of Ashchin month is celebrated as Sharad Purnima
 sharad poornima ko kojogaar poornima vrath or raas poornima bhi kaha jaataa he
 On this day, recitation of Laxmistotra, Srisukta should be done
 is vidhi se kojagar vrath karne se mata lakshmi ati prasann hoti hai tathaa dhan-dhaany, maan-pratishtha aadi sabhisukh pradaanakrti hai
 Sharad Purnima fasting method- On the full moon day, in the morning one should worship the presiding deity
 - indra or mahalakshmi ji kaa pujan karke ghi ke deepak jalaakar uski gandh pushp aadi se puja kerani chahie
 - Brahmins should have kheer food and offer alms to Dakshina
 - lakshmi prapti ke liye is vrath ko vishesh rup se kiya jaataa he
 On this day, the wealth and wealth of those who awakened are increased
 - raat ko chandramaa ko arghya dene ke baad hi bhojan karnaa chahie
 - There is a law of offering Kheer in the temple
 aisa mana jaataa he ki is din chand kii chandani se amrit barasata he
 According to the importance of Sharad Purnima, if the rituals are performed on this day, then it is definitely successful
 tisare pahar is din vrath kar haathiyon kii aarti karne par utam fal milte he
 It is believed that Lord Krishna composed Maharas with the gopis on this day
 is din chandramaa ki kirnon se amrit varsha hone kii kivdanti prasiddh he
 For this reason, by making kheer on this day and keeping it in the moonlight overnight, there is a method of eating in the morning on the next day
 sharad poornima vrath kathakthanusaar ek sahuukaar kii do betiyaan thi or donon poornima kaa vrath rakhti thi
 The elder daughter duly completed the fast and the younger left the fast incomplete
 falswaroop choti ladki ke bachche janm lete hi mar jate the
 Once the virtuous touch of the elder girl made her child come alive and from that day onwards, this fast started to be celebrated in full
 is din mata mahalakshmi ji kii puja kii jaati he
 It is believed that by fasting on this day, all wishes are fulfilled
 kyon lagaaya jaataa he kheer kaa bhoga?is din vrath rakh kar vidhividhan se lakshminarayan kaa pujan karen or raat main kheer banaakar use raat main aasmaan ke neeche rakh den taaki chandramaa kii chandani kaa prakaash kheer par pade
 On the second day, take a bath in the morning and offer Kheer in your home's temple to at least 3 Brahmins as Kheer Prasad and then distribute the Kheer Prasad to your family
 is prasad ko grahan karne se anek prakaar ke rogon se chhutkaaraa miltaa he
 What science says 
 
 sharad poornima kii raat chandramaa hamaari dharti ke bahut kareeb hota he
 Therefore the chemical elements present in the light of the moon fall directly on the earth
 khaane-pine kii chijen khule aasmaan ke neeche rakhane se chandramaa kii kirne sidhe un par padati he jisase vishesh poshak tatv khaadya padaarthon main mil jate hai jo hamaari sehat ke liye anukool hote hai

 bharat ke khilaaf iesai kii sajeesh kisi se chhipi nahin he
 But for the first time it has been revealed by the person who used to go to the secret meeting of ISI and Lashkar as the personal bodyguard of Lakhvi, the mastermind of Mumbai attack
 uskaa naam he abu anas jo tihaad main kaid, lashkar e taiyaba kaa fidaayin aatankwaadi he or mumbai hamale ke mastmaid yani lashkar ke chif commander jacki urr rahamaan lakhvi kaa body guard
 Anas imprisoned in Tihar has unleashed secrets from the intelligence agencies that have exposed the Pakistan Army and ISI
 anis ne bataaya 'san 2001 main lashkar e taiyaba se judaane ke baad mujhe july 2005 main jackieurr rahamaan ke daftar bulaayaa gaya or hukum diya gaya ki mujhe ab choubison ghante lakhvi sahab ke body guard ke taur par unki hifaazat kerani he
 Three more guards were with me
 chif commander lakhvi ke saath hamaari mulaakaaten mujaffarabad main iesai ke afasaron ke saath hoti thi jinamein bharat ke khilaaf hone vaale oparation tay kiye jate the
 The biggest disclosure about Lakhvi was made by her bodyguard Anas when she was asked during questioning which ISI officers had the command of lashkar-e-taiba
 lakhvi or iesai ke afasaron kii mulaakaaten baar-baar hoti thi
 The meeting with two senior ISI officers, Brigadier Riaz and Brig Haji, was held at a safe house at Tarmabadi Chowk near Islamabad
 ye donon hi brigadier hindustan main hone vaale lashkar ke aatankwaadi oparation ke plan tay karte the
 The ISI not only gifted expensive Toyota Land Cruiser vehicle to Lakhvi but also posted a Major rank officer of Pakistan Army in Muzaffarabad to maintain constant contact with him
 iskaa khulaasa bhi lakhvi ke body guard ne hi kiya
 Anas said, 'our Chief Commander (lakhvi) had an office in a madrasa in Shivayanala area of muzaffarabad
 is madrase main do badi imaaraten hai jo kareeb 50 acre jameen par bani hai
 Major Wajahat of ISI used to come here and Lakhvi had a secret meeting with him many times
 meeting ke samay ham kamare ke baahar rahete the
 Abu Anas also revealed that the Lashkar had an equal supply of light machine guns, mortars, rocket launchers and army grenades, in addition to a raft of AK rifles
 gola barood or hathiyaaron kii supplai sidhe lakhvi hi sambhalata tha
 Abu Anas made the biggest disclosure that while funds for lashkar-e-taiba came from Saudi Arabia, weapons were provided in Pakistan itself
 saaf he ki itane bade khaufnak aatankwaadi ke peeche iesai hi khadi he
 What would be more convincing evidence that his body guard, who lives with Lakhvi like a shadow, has revealed him
 jackieurrarahaman ke bodyguard ne naa sirf iesai ke teror link kaa khulaasa kiya, balki apane aakaa ke bare main wo baaten bataayin jisase ab tak duniya anjaan thi
 Lakhvi's body guard Anas also revealed that Lakhvi received crores of rupees as donations from Saudi Arabia and other countries, according to which he had hired a person named Hyder as an accountant
 pehali baar lakhvi jaise khatarnaak aatankwaadi kii nijee jindagi ke bare main khufia agenciyon ko abu anas se hi jaankaree mili
 Lakhvi has four sons and five daughters
 lakhvi ne khud apane sabase bade bete vasi ko fidaayin kii tranning di thi or use 2006 main jammu-kashmir bheja tha
 Her two more sons, Raziur Rahman and Walid, are training in madrasas
 lakhvi kii do biviyaan hai jisamen se uski ek bivi uske saath mujaffarabad main rahati he
 According to sources, Lakhvi's son Wasi was killed in an encounter in Jammu and Kashmir, due to which Lakhvi stepped up the campaign against Hindustan
 abu anas ne ye bhi ishaara kiya ki lakhvi kii pakistan main kai sampattiyaan he or wo kitna rais he iskaa andaja lagaana mushkil he
 Lakhvi, a storehouse of terror, is fond of weapons and gives AK-56 as a gift to his loved ones

 Guterres was asked if he was trying to start a dialogue between India and Pakistan for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute, in response to which Guterus laughed and said, "after all, i met Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif thrice and Indian Prime Minister
 Why have i met Narendra Modi twice? 'guteras pararope lag rahe hai ki vah kashmir maamle ko sulajhane or karrwai karne se batch rahe hai

 Retig: 4 Stardirector: Shreejit Mukherjee Artist: Vidya Balan, Ila Arun, Gauhar Khan, Pallavi Sharda, Chunky Pandey, Ashish Vidyarthi, Rajat Kapoor and Naseeruddin Shahvidya Balan in need of a lively performance, and have got that opportunity with Begum Jaan
 begum jaan main unhone dikhaane kii koshish kii he ki agar role solid dhang se likhaa gaya ho to ve use behtareen dhang se anjaam de sakati hai
 This time he has got his chance
 bengali hit film raajakhini ke is hindi rimek main har vah baat jo ek behtareen cinema ke liye jaruri hoti he
 Be it the best actors, the camera is awesome, the solid characterization or the story
 har morche par “begum jaan” khari utarati he
 The film is completely focused on the fact that in the world of men, women both live and die on their own
 kahani kii batakahani begum jaan (vidya baalan) kii he jo kothaa chalaati he or jahaan kuch ladkiyaan rahati hai
 The world of these women is limited in this and if power prevails here Begum Jaan ki
 film kii shuruyaat vibhaajan or aazaadee ke saath hoti he
 The freedom that tragedy brought with it and the sting on freedom in the film is amazing because when Begum asks, "what freedom for a tawaif
" 
 
 lite band sab ek baraabar
 
 
 In such a situation, the question of independence is questioned
 film kaa aurat or samaaj main uske astitv ko lekar jis tarah ke sawaal paidaa kiye gaye hai, ve vaaki lambey samay se bollywood main se dhang se nahin aa sake the
 Then with the tragedy of Partition, this story of a brothel and the women living in it does not provide such an opportunity to look anywhere from the screen
 phir film ke bich main ila arun jo bahadur mahilaon kii kahaniyaan sunaati hai, ve bhi rochak he
 Star Appeal Shreejit has engraved every character in such a solid way that the film is not just a focus on lore but it is like a collage that has a different shade and each shade has its own significance
 unke bina yah kolaj katai puraa nahin he
 Vidya has done a great acting in the role of Begum
 jabardast dialog bole hai, jo sirf ankhen hi nahin kholte hai balki tamaacha jadte lagate hai
 Then the character of Gauhar Khan in the film is memorable
 ve jab apane seene or jaanghon ke bich apane premi kaa haath rakhkar use aurat hone kaa matlab samajhaati he to film pitrusattatmak samaaj ke munh par tamaacha jadte hue lagati he
 Pallavi Sharda has also done great acting
 begum jaan ke kothe kaa jis tarah kaa chitra khinchaa gaya he, vah vaaki dil main bas jaataa he, or har mahilapaatr dil ke kareeb jaan padati hai
 Chunky Pandey's role of Kabir will be remembered for a long time
 unhone danga karaane main maahir kaaiyaan shaks ke apane role ko itane khubsuurati se nibhaayaa he, jo vaaki kaabiletarif he
 Likes to hate that character
 kamai kii batfilm kaa sangeet bahut hi clasik dhang he
 Which fits the film perfectly
 aaj jab samaaj main sampradayikta kaa dansh teji se ghulata najar aa rahaa he, or dharm pahchaan banataa ja rahaa he, begum jaan ne sahi samay par dastak di he
 He has tried to bring out the face of male dominated society, and there are many scenes which force him to be ashamed of being male
 aise purush jinke liye aurat sirf deh he, usase zyada kuch nahin he
 Begum Jaan's budget is about 15 crores
 bataaya jaataa he
 The overwhelming acting, strong story and painful picture of the past serves to connect the film
 film ko is hafte hollywood kii hit frenchiji fast and furious-8 se takkar milegi
 The combat here can be a bit tuff
 vaise bhi vidya kii filmon ko box offis par dhire-dhire raftaar pakadaney kaa record rahaa he
 Demonetisation is going to be two months and the supply of cash in the market is also getting better than before, but the biggest hit of demonetisation is on farmers
 aam janata bhale hi sasti sabji se khush ho, lekin kisaan apni laagat tak naa nikal paane kii vajah se pareshaan hai
 One of the farmers was not able to sell the produce due to demonetisation, but now there is double trouble due to the arrival of new crop
 'aaj tak' kii team dilli kii sabase badi thok sabji mandiyon main se ek gajipur sabji mandi pahunchi
 The decline in the price of vegetables has not been normalized since the time of demonetisation
 thok dukandaaron or kisaanon ne bataaya ki laagat se kam keemat par maal bechnaa unki majaburi he
 Normally, the process of transaction starts in the morning in Ghazipur vegetable market
 kisaan din chadhate hi vyapaariyon ko subjiyan bechakar nikal jate hai, jabaki ab dopaher tak kisaan apni subjiyan vyapaariyon ko bechney kii koshish main hi lage najar aa rahe thea
 Traders say that the stock of vegetables is already lying and due to the arrival of new crop from above, the trouble has increased
 alam ye he ki maal zyada he or khariddaar kam hai
 This is the reason why farmers are being forced to sell their produce at a very low price
 dilli kii gajipur mandi main subjiyon kii thok keemten kuch is tarah hai
 Potato: Rs 4-5 kg: Rs 2-3 kg / kg: Rs 5-7 / kg: Rs 20 / kg: Rs 10-12 / kg: Rs 7 / kg / kg: Rs 7 / kg 30 kg bag sold in market for Rs 90 , Whereas the farmer is getting Rs 15-20 per thirty kg
 darasal isamen adhiktar subjiyon kii nai fasalein aa gai hai
 In such a situation, the prices of vegetables are still falling
 sabji vyapaaree kah rahe hai ki itnaa nuksaan kabhi nahin hua
 Farmers are neither getting the cost of their produce nor are the merchants getting their usual sales
 aam janata subjiyon kii kam keemat se khush he, jabaki kisaan barbaadi kii kagaar par he

 sibiai court se sajaa paae aarushi ke mata-pita rajesh talwaar or nupur talwaar ko elahabaad hai court ne sabooton ke abhaav main bari kar diya he
 He will also be released in the next few hours
 lekin sawaal abhi bhi jinda he ki aakhir aarushi or hemraj ko kisne maaraa
 Questions are also being raised on the CBI investigation
 isi bich ek nai baat saamne ai he ki sibiai ne krime seen kii ek jaanch sirf isliye nahin karai thi kyonki vah kaaphi mahangi thi
 The CBI argued that its team had collected all the circumstantial and 'scientific' evidence from the crime scene to find the killer
 jis vajah se usne 'tach-diene' test nahin karavaaya kyonki vah kaaphi mahangaa bhi padataa he
 According to the news published in Deccan Chronicle, samples of 'touch-dna' test are sent to the UK as there is no facility in the country for this sophisticated scientific test
 'tach-diene' krime seen par chute diene kaa vishleshan karne kii ek forensik vidhi he
 Rajesh Talwar had said that according to Mangkhabar, Rajesh Talwar initially emphasized the need for LCN or Touch DNA test to prove his innocence in this case
 agency ne pareekshan ke liye chaar videshi prayogshaalaon se sampark bhi kiya tha
 Only one UK laboratory agreed to develop DNA with the LCN technique
 lekin mahangi laagat or visheshgyon kii raay ki jaanch kaa tarika phulpruf nahin he, sibiai ne 'tach diene' jaanch karwaane kaa faisla chhod diya
 The news says that a section of top CBI officials was against spending Rs 50 lakh for the test because they argued that DNA samples were already contaminated

 Several questions were raised based on his claim, which has been answered by Arvind
 bataaya he ki 2011 se 2016 ke bich bharat kii arthvyavastha ko kai gambhir jatke lage hai
 Exports collapsed, banks incurred losses, corporate expansion, drought and demonetisation

 financial express ke rishi ranjan kaala kii report he
 In 2017-18, the electronic ministry said that there are 120 companies that make mobile phones and their parts
 farvari 2019 main jab neshnal policy on electranik banaai gai tab kaha gaya ki mobile handset or purje banane vaali companiyon kii sankhya 268 ho gai he
 All this has happened in the last 3-4 years
 disambar 2018 main pradhanmantri kehete hai ki 120 companiyaan mobile bana rahi hai
 In the interim budget of 1 February 2019, the Finance Minister stated its number 268
 jab financial express ne padtaal kii to pataa chalaa ki bharat main 127 unit hai jo mobile phone banaati hai
 Only 41 percent of these are operational, ie in running condition
 65 unit main se 55 pratishat to keval bydaree banaati hai
 85 companies make chargers
 samvaadadaata ne jab mantralay se poocha ki kitni companiyaan yaa unit mobile phone kaa utpaadan kar rahi hai to jawaab nahin mila
 This is the answer to most questions of reporters
 yahi nahin in companio ko beuro of standard main panjikaran karana hota he, unke paas bhi aankade nahin hai
 According to the National Policy on Electronic 2019, handset production in India has increased from 6 crore in 2014-15 to 22 in 2017-18
 5 karod ho gaya
 6 directly and indirectly in it
 7 lakh logon ko kaam mila
 In 2015, imports of fully finished mobile phone items stood at $ 8 billion
 2018 main 3
 $ 5 billion remains
 yani kaaphi ghat gaya
 On the other hand import of mobile phone accessories2
 8 arab dollar se badhkar 11
 6 billion dollars
 is saal kuch kam hua he
 Such a report was also published in Hindustan Times last year
 jiske bare main hamane fasebuk pej par likhaa tha
 Rishi Ranjan Kala, a journalist with Financial Express, says in response to the RTI that there are 342 units
 kuch overlap ho saktaa he isliye mantralay ne unit kii sankhya 268 hi bataai
 There are 15 such units who have registered themselves to make mobile phones and battery packs
 ek hi company do kaam kar rahi he to ek hi gina jaae
 Kala sahib writes that these should be counted 1
 BIS kii website par iskaa koi hisaab nahin he ki kitne mobile phone kaa utpaadan hota he
 But it is calculated according to how many units are operational and how many have been shut down
 iske alaava rishi ranjan kaala ne register of company ke data se bhi check kiya he
 One company is Rising Stars Mobile India Private Limited which manufactures mobile phones
 BIS kii site bataati he ki maharashtra main is company kii ek unit he jiskaa panjikaran laps ho gaya he
 Andhra Pradesh also has two units
 jahaan kai companiyon ke phone banate hai
 Blabbering regarding the data will continue to be successful
 aise vishleshan janata ke bich pahunchate hi nahin he

 Behind the scenes
 
 Rehabilitating and re-conditioning my body has taken almost 10 months now
 And I’m still in the process
 
 Torn right ankle ligaments and a sprained left plus a thorasic slip disc
 As if one was not enough
 
 My coordination was incredibly messed up
 I’d say jump and my body wouldn’t listen
 Couldn't load the feet or my spine
 Needless to say i was losing muscle mass and gaining unwanted weight by the day
 Couldn't do any cardio or weights
 Only thing i could control so as to not fall off the grid completely was my diet
 Not eating the stuff i liked frustrated me further
 
 I'v been sharing a few clips here from that journey
 zmr’s with light weights, band work plus whole lot of other techniques i discovered
 The most important being writing down each day's progress
 I’d aim to do 1 more than yesterday
 
 i hope it helps those who are currently in pain or injured
 My rehab and conditioning has been frustratingly slow, after 3 months of a lot of effort and very little results, i was plagued with self doubt and a part of me wanted to quit
 
 But there is magic in consistency
 
 Trust it
 And keep going
 
 All the best!

 Sushma Swaraj said that Pakistan is teaching us a human rights lesson to shed blood of innocents
 jab aatankwaadiyon ne gujarat ke samudr tat se mumbai jane ke liye vyapaaree nauka 'kuber' kaa apharan kiya tha usase bahut pehle hi anisht ke sanket ubharne lage the
 It is different that the government and security forces refused to understand it
 pichley chaar varshon main gujarat sarkaar ne apane 1,600 kimi lambey samudr tat ke liye vyapak suraksha yojana ke bare main kai samaran patr centre sarkaar ko bheje the, lekin har baar grih mantralay ne use nakaar diya
 The last denial was given on November 21, just five days before the terrorist attack on Mumbai
 gujarat ke grih rajyamantri amit shah kehete hai, ''hamane centre sarkaar ko samajhane kii koshish kii ki adhpaki yojanaayen kargar nahin hongi kyonki ham pakistan seemaa se bahut dur nahin hai
 But the concept of security of the center had many flaws
 '' pichley saal aantarik suraksha ke masale par mukhyamantriyon ke sammelan main narendra modi ne yah maamla uthaaya tha lekin unka prayaas bhi deevaaron se takkar maarane jaisaa hi tha
 The proposal was first brought in 2003, when the bjp-led NDA government was at the center
 371 karod ru
 The proposed five-year plan of the state included arranging 51 police stations, 70 checkpoints, 90 surveillance towers, 32 fast-moving boats, three interceptor boats along the state's coastline and issuing identity cards to fishermen from coastal villages
 sarkaar ne machuaaron kii gatividhiyon par najar rakhane ke liye ek machuaaraa nigaraanee samooh sthapit karne kaa bhi prastaav rakhaa tha (dekhen box)
 Five years later, the state government is still awaiting approval of these proposals
 is bich, apane yupoton dwaara karachi par hamale ke 37 saal baad bhartiya nausena apana nausena diwas nahin manaa rahi, kyonki desh samudri maarg se hue pehle hamale se hui kshati kaa shok manaa rahaa he
 By the way, the terrorists have not attacked the country for the first time from the sea
 1993 main pakistan se naavon par hi ardex laayaa gaya tha, jiskaa ismemaal mumbai main 13 jagah hamale karne main kiya gaya
 Then 257 people were killed in terrorist attacks
 janvari, 2005 main apni tateey suraksha yojana main centre sarkaar ne aath rajyon or chaar centre shasit kshetron main vishesh teevr gati kii naukaaon or kartavyanishth karmchaariyon se las samudri thane sthapit karne ke liye 742 karod ru
 Was approved
 iske antargat 7,600 kimi lanbaa bhartiya tat kshetra aata he
 Three of these states — Tamil Nadu, Odisha and Kerala — have not yet implemented the scheme, while in Maharashtra the scheme has just started
 simaaon kii ceiling ke kaaran aatankwaadiyon ke liye samudr ke raste pravesh aasaan ho gaya he
 In the last two years, intelligence agencies warned that the Pakistani Navy and ISI were plotting to infiltrate the coastal area as trained terrorist fishermen
 nausena ke ek varisht adhikari kehete hai, ''pichley do varshon se ham sarkaar se vaisel trephic management system (yaa vitmes) jaisi vyavastha kii maang kar rahe hai, jiske tahat sabhi khatarnaak naukaaon kii toh lee ja sakati he
 We also demanded the issuance of electronic cards to all fishermen
 ''gujarat or kerala ke bich lagbhag 3,300 kimi ke samvedansheel samudr tat kii nigaraanee main lage pashchimi kshetra ke coast guard (tatarakshak sena) ke paas vibhinn aakaaron ke 14 jahaajon or aath nigaraanee hawaii jahaajon kaa bedaa he, jabaki asal main ise kam-se-kam 50 jalpoton or 36 hawaii jahaajon kii jarurat he
 Neither the Coast Guard nor the Navy is empowered to intercept or search merchant vessels
 yah visheshadhikaar tat par niyukt naukarshah jahajrani mahanideshak kaa hi he, or uske paas na to karmchaaree hote hai or na hi jahaaj
 After the horrific terrorist attack on two skyscrapers of the World Trade Center on 9 / 11 in the US, the US government brought 22 agencies, including Customs and the Coast Guard, under the flag of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
 bharat main samudr taton kii suraksha kii jimmedaari pratiraksha mantralay ke tahat kaam karne vaali nausena or coast guard par chhod di gai he, is tarah samudr tat suraksha sambandhi nitiyon kaa nirdhaaran naukarshahi ke bhulbhulaiya vaale galiyaaron main kho jaataa he
 In addition to the eight coastal states and four union territories, 12 ministries and eight departments of the central government are responsible for the coastal policy formulation and implementation
 iskaa parinaam yah hota he ki jimmedaariyaan kai jagah bant jaati hai or turant faisle or karrwai karne main dikkatein aati hai
 Since the strengthening of beach security is a slow process, it takes a few years for the staff to be hired and the platform (adequate facilities) to be provided
 isliye un sambhavit thikaanon ke bare main pehle se pahchaan kar lenaa bahut jaruri he jin par hamale karne ke liye aatankwaadi samudr ke jariye aasaani se pahunch sakate hai
 Vice Admiral Arun Kumar Singh, former director general of the Coast Guard, says, "I do not doubt that Mumbai will always be a natural target of attack and it needs maximum security; Apart from this, tourist destinations like Goa, Port Blair and Chennai are also very popular among American, British and Israeli tourists
 inaki bhi turant kadi suraksha vyavastha kii jaani chahie
 "but the Gujarat government is most concerned about the safety of industrial establishments in the area ranging from Kutch to Valsad
" yah pattee bharat ke kuch sarvaadhik bade audyogic pratishthanon ke nirmaan par garv kar sakati he
 These include Reliance and Essar's crude oil refining plants on the Jamnagar coast; Ports such as Kandla, Adani and ppwav include Reliance and other companies' petrochemical plants at Hazira near Surat and new industries set up at Dahej port near Bhadchh
 rajya police ke varisht adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki mumbai main aasaani se pravesh paane vaale visphotakon se las aatankwaadi in audyogic pratishthanon ko utani hi sahajata se nishaanaa bana sakate hai, khaskar kachche tel or petrochemical parisaron par
 Hazira is India's major petrochemical hub where about 50% of India's gas is treated and gail's hazira-bijapur-jagdishpur pipeline starts from here
 in audyogic ikaayiyon kii jvalansheeltaa ko dekhte hue kaha ja saktaa he ki mumbai hamale main aatankwaadiyon ne jitne visphotakon or aslha kaa upyog kiya, uskaa aadha hissaa hi hajira ko tabah karne ke liye paryaapt he
 Says Chetan Shah, president of the South Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry, "air and naval security should be provided to areas such as Hazira, Jamnagar and Dahej as terrorist attacks at any one of these centers could cripple India
" ''arase se is baat kii ashanka vyakt kii ja rahi thi ki saurashtra-kuccha samudri ilaake main machhlee pakadte hue pakistani samudri suraksha agency kii giraft main aae machuaare pakistani jasuson kii ranneeti kaa shikaar ban sakate hai
 However, no evidence has yet been found to confirm this
 ab tak vahaan se lautaa sirf ek machuaaraa hi bhartiya suraksha agenciyon kii jaanch ke daayre main aa paaya he
 "there are hundreds of fishermen in Pakistani jails," says a senior intelligence officer in Kutch
 or kuch to unke fande main aa hi gaye honge
 We have no means of searching them
 ''pradhanmantri ne raashtra ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha, ''ham unhen isaki baari keemat chukaane ko majaboor karenge
 His words were to this effect
 unke shabdon par yakeen kiya ja saktaa tha, yadi unki sarkaar or adhikariyon ne samay par sahi kadam uthaa liya hota
 But if this government continues to heal in the same way and is slow to take action - as happened in the case of Gujarat - it will not take long for the terrorists to attack again
 he koi sunne vaala?centre sarkaar ne tateey suraksha ke anurodh ko hameshaa hi thukraayaa
 - On April 4, 2003, the Government of Gujarat paid Rs
 371 crore for protection of 1,600 km long coastline
 kii panchavarshiya yojana kaa praaroop centre sarkaar ke paas bheja
 - UPA comes to power at the Center in 2004, and demands a revised security plan from the Gujarat government
 uske jawaab main gujarat sarkaar 30 may, 2005 ko 321 karod ru
 Sends the draft of the revised plan of
 - upie sarkaar yojana main kaat-chhaant kar 58 karod ru
 Approves the scheme of, under which there is a provision to set up 10 police stations
 ise gujarat sarkaar pehle hi lagu kar chuki he
 - Assuming that Rs 58 crore
 tateey suraksha ke liye paryaapt nahin hai, gujarat sarkaar 219 karod ru
 Another scheme of the government sends for approval of the central government, which is rejected by the central government
 - 5 july, 2007 ko gujarat sarkaar centre sarkaar ko ek anya patr bhej apane faisle par punarvichaar karne kaa anurodh karti he
 He gets the answer that the plan is not being approved and it will be considered in 2010 itself
 - april, 2008 main laalkrishna adwani pradhanmantri se milte hai, or gujarat sarkaar kii yojana par phir vichaar karne kaa anurodh karte hai

 Eminent editor, writer, thinker Prabhash Joshi was born on July 15, 1937 in the village of Ashta in Sihor district in Madhya Pradesh
 indore ke maharaja shiva ji raav middle skool or hai skool main praarambhik kakshaon ke alaava unhone holkar college, gujarati college or chrishchiyan college main ganit or vigyaan padhai kii, phir devas ke sunwaani mahakaal main gram seva or adhyaapan kiya
 He started working in 'nayi Duniya' in 1960, considering journalism as a medium for social change and worked with Rajendra Mathur, Sharad Joshi and Rahul Barputay
 yaheen par unhone vinoba bhaave kii pehali nagar yatra kii reporting kii
 In 1966, along with Sharad Joshi, he took out the daily 'madhya Pradesh' from Bhopal and came to Delhi in 1968 and took responsibility for publication in the National Gandhi Committee
 prabhaash joshi ne saal 1972 main chambal or bundelkhand ke daakuon ke samarpan ke liye lokanayak jaiprakash narayan ke saath bhi kaam kiya
 Wrote a book on this use of non-violence with Anupam Mishra and Shravan Kumar Garg - Chambal's guns, at Gandhi's feet
 saal 1974 main unhone saptahik ‘prajaniti’ or ‘aas paas’ nikaala, jo imargency main band ho gaya
 He then joined the Express group in January 1978
 april 1981 tak unhone chandigarh main ‘indian express’ kaa sampadan kiya
 Then he was the editor of the Delhi edition of 'indian Express' for two years
 yaheen san 1983 main prabhaash joshi ke sampadan main ‘jansatta’ kaa prakaashan shuru hua
 Prabhash Joshi's books 'masi Kagad' and 'hindu Being Dharma' were published
 5 navambar, 2009 ko dilli main unka nidhan hua
 He was a socialist journalist who analyzed the history of his time
 uske saath hi apane sakriy vaicharik pahal se samakaleen itihaas ko banane main bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 In the book 'kahne ko a lot', the book has a collection of representative articles, choosing from the entire writing of Prabhash Joshi
 aaj ke samay main aise patrkaar or samaaj chintak kii kami ek gatirodh or yathasthiti kaa maahaul bana rahi he, tab prabhaash joshi ke ye lekh ek nai pahal ke liye prerit karte hai
 The chapters under the book in which the articles are placed, are: Journalism is Sadchirita, my Hindi condition, around the peaks, the backstories of Raj Manch, the aesthetics of sports and i go back to Narmada again and again! These titles only narrate the narratives of the articles written in the book! Today, on the birth anniversary of Prabhash Joshi, the excerpt of his book 'kahne ko khuni thi' - Kou PM Hou Hamhin's Chintha Jawaharlal lasted for seventeen years
 laal bahadur shastri ke paune do saal ke baad indira gandhi ai to chhachath se satattar or phir koi paanch saal yani ve bhi satraa saal chalin

 a total of five non-nehru dynasty prime ministers lasted for five and a half years

 That is, six Prime Ministers spent some ten years and five months
 inamen bhi saadhe chah saal congressi pradhanmantriyon ke rahe
 There were four non-congress-non-nehruvian Prime Ministers who ruled for four years, which would mean an average of one year
 isaki tulana main akele jawaharlal nehru ke satraa saal bina kisi brake ke, satraa saal indira gandhi ke paune teen saal ke ek brake ke saath or rajeev gandhi ke paanch saal
 If nothing else like this, the Nehru dynasty has given the longest stability to count only the years
 uske baad narsingh raav ne

 But if the tenure of elected Prime Ministers is counted like the reign of history dynasties in democratic India, you would say that in a democracy this feudal mentality and feudal history is an undesirable and reliable extension of vision

 ve is pad ke paanch saal se ummidavaar hai or satna se bhale hi haar gaye hon param pad kii lau unke bai pasavaale dil main hameshaa lagi rahati he
 After all, Narasimha Rao, a by-passer, may not have been in the heart before, but he has been engaged since being the Prime Minister
 arjuna singh kaa dil to phir bhi narsingh raav se zyada majboot he
 Narayan Dutt Tiwari, the president of Arjun Singh's party, did not say and hide but indirectly his allegation was that Narasimha Rao considered him as his rival, so he made his stay in the Congress difficult and finally he had to be with Arjun Singh
 apana pratidwandvi maane jane ke kaaran narsingh raav dwaara congress se nikaale jane kaa sabase joardaar daawa or prachaar madhavrao sindhiya ne gwalior main kiya
 He would describe the glorious Raj tradition of the Scindia in his election meetings and say that he was a minister at the center to develop Gwalior but Rao Saab felt that it would become the Prime Minister
 isliye unhen nikaal baahar kiya
 He continued to instill the belief in the minds of his former subjects that why the party is focusing the world's media attention on Gwalior as a new Prime Minister is about to emerge from here who will take India in the twenty-first century on the lines of Rajiv Gandhi
 rajeev gandhi rajvansh ke the or madhavrao bhi hai
 Rajiv was born in forty-four years and Scindia Maharaj was one year after him
 apane ko nijee taur par maaloom nahin lekin dilli ke raajnneetik chandukhaane main ek baat yah bhi chalati rahi he ki madhavrao sindhiya apane ko gaiyr bhaajapai jamaavade kaa aam sahmati kaa pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar maanate hai
 In Gwalior, this was commonly said during the election campaign
 or phir narsingh raav jaise andhra ke kaarinde pradhanmantri ho sakate hai to sindhiya rajvansh ke shrimant maharaj kyon nahin ho sakate
 If Sindhia did not have the ability and the possibility of being Prime Minister, then why was Narasimha Rao so afraid of him? Why do they conspire and implicate them in hawala? The Maharaja of Sindhia dynasty may need some handover money? Deve Gowda's name did not run for the post of Prime Minister from Karnataka

 Along with her trusted warlord Ahmed Patel, Sonia has once again started reviving the party
 party kaa desh ke adhikansh hisson main safaya ho chukaa he isliye yah ek bada kaam hoga
 At present, the Congress is in power in only five states and two of them — Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh — are running on a marginal majority
 lagaataar do aam chunaavon main apmanjanak paraajay ke baad, aapasi jhagada or asantosh lagbhag sabhi rajya ikaayiyon main punap rahaa he
 Since the May 23 results, many influential leaders have left the Congress and many others have been publicly making statements against the party
 sabase zyada kalah to maharashtra or haryana main dikh rahi he jahaan vidhansabha chunaav aakhri charan main hai
 Three different teams have emerged within the Congress, who at times work on opposite objectives from the party line and this raises fears about the party's long-term survival
 pehali team main ve netaa hai jinhone apane pehle kaarykaal main sonia ke saath milakar kaam kiya tha
 The other team is of people who are professionals with non-political background and who have worked in Rahul Gandhi's office
 teesri team un anya pramukh netaaon kii he jo yaa to donon main se kisi bhi kheme main nahin hai yaa phir jinhone gandhi parivaar kaa bharosa kho diya he
 And the number of this team is increasing
 sonia ke haath jabase kaman lauti he, party ke har faisle main unki puraani team kii chhap or asar saaf-saaf dekhi ja sakati he
 For example, in Maharashtra where elections are to be held on October 21, Balasaheb Thorat, a relatively low-profile, was made the president of the state Congress and then the factionalism of the party unit came to the surface
 may ke baad se purv mantri kripashankar singh tathaa harshavardhan patil or vidhayak nitesh rane samet kareeb ek darjan netaaon ne party ko alavida kah diya
 Both Rahul and Sonia were accepted in the name of Thorat, so that there was less opposition from strong leaders like former Maharashtra Chief Ministers Ashok Chavan and Prithviraj Chavan
 lekin kendriya netritv ne milind devda ke saath koi dayaa nahin dikhaai jinhone rahul ke istife or sonia kii vaapasi ke bich ke 90 dinon kii avadhi main congress adhyaksh ke rup main ek yuva kushal netaa kii khuleam maang kii thi
 Congress insiders claim that Deora is no longer asked in the party, who resigned from the post of Mumbai Congress president after the Lok Sabha elections
 agar congress ke sutron par bharosa karen to party ke liye yuva adhyaksh kii maang se sonia ke kaan khadey ho gaye the, jisaki jarurat sabase pehle punjab ke mukhyamantri amarinder singh ne bataai thi
 Although the initial strategy was to place a low-profile loyalist of the Gandhi family on the post of party president — which probably lasted until Rahul changed his mind and returned as president — but leaders like Shashi Tharoor demanded elections Sonia was forced to think again
 congress kaarysmiti ke ek sadsy kaa kahana he, ''ve kabhi anicchhuk nahin thim, ve chaahati hai ki bagdor gandhi parivaar ke haathon main hi rahe
 Had elections taken place and no Gandhi contested, power could have gone into the hands of a younger and possibly more skilled person
 or haalanki teen gandhiyon ke raajnneeti main sakriy rahane ke kaaran aise congress aghyaksh ke lambey samay tak kursi par bane rahane kii sambhaavna kam hi he, phir bhi vah koi jokhim nahin lenaa chaahati hai
 They are suspecting the ambitions of Tharoor, Deora, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Sachin Pilot
 ''isse sonia ke vafaadaaron ke liye daravaaje khul gaye
 With his return as party chief, the people who got the posts after holding the top post of Rahul also had to leave their posts
 25 may ko seedblusi kii baithak main aatmanirikshan or aatm-aalochana kii ekmaatr aawaaj madhya pradesh congress ke netaa jyotiraditya sindhiya kaa bhavishya ab anishchit dikhataa he
 For Scindia, the post of president of Madhya Pradesh Congress was once considered strong, which is currently occupied by Chief Minister Kamal Nath
 lekin jab unke samarthakon ne kamalnath or rajya ke duusare diggaj digvijay singh ko nishane par lenaa shuru kiya to sindhiya majbootee se unka saath nahin de sake kyonki unhen dilli se bahut kam samarthan tha
 He lost the Lok Sabha elections, which further weakened his position
 mumbai congress ke purv adhyaksh sanjay nirupam (jo march tak rahul ke bharosemand hone kaa anand le rahe the, lekin phir rahul ke ek anya chahete devda ne unki jagah le lee thi) ne puraane diggajon ke khilaaf khule taur par yah aarope lagaate hue vidroh kar diya ki maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke liye tikat vitaran main unki andekhi kii gai he
 "I agree that Scindia has some real grievances, but why is Nirupam targeting senior leaders," says a leader of the old trusted camp
 He was removed by Rahul
 ''rajasthan main bhi, aisi atakalein hai ki mukhyamantri ashok gahalot jald hi kuch or up-mukhyamantriyon kii niyukti kar sakate hai
 At present, this position is with Gehlot's rival Sachin Pilot
 haalanki kuch congressiyon kaa tark he ki yah rajya main prabhaavshaalee jatiyon ko lubhaane ke liye ek kadam ho saktaa he lekin bahut se log ise payalat kii haisiyat main katautee karne ke prayaas ke rup main dekhte hai
 The 42-year-old president of the Rajasthan Congress, who led the party to victory in the 2018 assembly elections, defeated Gehlot in the race to become chief minister as the Gandhi family decided to wager on the old loyalists
 party ke ek varisht netaa kaa kahana he, ''mukhyamantri kii kursi par najar rakhane kii bajaae, unhen rajasthan congress adhyaksh kii apni kursi bachaae rakhane par dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie
 "by the way, Scindia and Nirupam still have faith in the party, but many others have said goodbye to the party
" purvottar main, shahi parivaar se aane vaale ek netaa pradyot maaniky debaburma, jinka sindhiya parivaar ke saath judaav bhi he, ne tripura congress kaa adhyaksh pad chhod diya he
 Debbarma was upset by the 'interference' of the then General Secretary-in-charge Luizinho Falero, who asked him to change his stance on the controversial National Citizenship Register (NRC)
 debaburma, jo tripura kii mul aabaadi kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai, or apane grih rajya main enarasi kii maang kar rahe hai or iske liye supreme court main ek cese bhi lard rahe hai
 He said, "there are many Congress leaders who are following the advice of the BJP and working to destroy the party
" '' debaburma ke istife ke baad, falero ko bhi 7 aktubar ko pad se hataa diya gaya
 But the old warlords also showed their influence clearly and within 24 hours, they were restored to their posts
 lekin sabase bade nuksaan main haryana congress ke purv adhyaksh ashok tanvar rahe hai
 Despite strong opposition from former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Tanwar enjoyed Rahul's patronage and held the post for more than five years
 sitambar main, sonia kii vafaadaar kumari shailaja ne tanvar kii jagah lee, jabaki hooda chunaav prabandhan samiti ke adhyaksh bane
 a month later, unhappy with the ticket distribution for the assembly elections, Tanwar resigned from the party
 kisi kaa naam liye bagaiyr, unhone kaha ki congress main acchhee tarah se apni jade jamaaye baithe kuch logon ko lagata he ki ve bhagwaan hai lekin logon ko nasht karne ke liye ve rakshason kii tarah vyavhaar kar rahe hai
 Though these people have refrained from saying anything against Rahul and Sonia, what is hurting the rebels the most is the apathy of the Gandhi family despite their plight
 jab party ke nae nizaam ne unhen nishaanaa banaaya to rahul ne unki raksha ke liye kuch khaas nahin kiya
 In fact, after stepping down on May 25, Rahul has not interfered in any political decision to shore up his people and confined himself to targeting the Modi government on his constituency, Wayanad and social media platforms
 is
 haryana or maharashtra main chunaav main do saptaah se bhi kam vakt bachaa he or ve achaanak videsh yatra par chale gaye hai jo party ke maamalon ke prati unki udaseenta ko darshata he
 However, there is no let down on his non-political appointments
 masalan, sonia ne party ke data analytics vibhaag ko 'technology or data cell' ke rup main phir se vyavasthit karne ke prastaav ko manjuuri di or praveen chakravarti ko cell kaa pramukh banaaya he
 The old veterans had specifically targeted Chakraborty after the Lok Sabha elections
 unhone aarope lagaaya tha ki chakravarti ne rahul ko nakli data ke saath gumraah kiya tha
 With this anger, another loyalist of Rahul and the organization's secretary of the party (although some insiders claim that he remains relevant only because of the 'official post'), and his role is now limited to issuing statements about appointments within the party Is left) of

 The family legacy of old loyalty to the Gandhi family is still the most valuable asset and two young Turks from Assam — Gaurav Gogoi and Sushmita Dev — prove it
 do baar ke saansad gaurav, assam ke purv mukhyamantri tarun gogoi ke bete hai
 Although the elder Gogoi is not a favorite of the old leaders, he enjoys the trust of everyone in the Gandhi family

 Sushmita is the daughter of the late Union Minister Santosh Mohan Dev, who was very close to Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia
 haalanki sushmita may main chunaav haar gayi, lekin ve mahila congress kii pramukh bani raheen or gandhi parivaar ke bich apni paith badhaai

 Another senior leader recently pointed to a viral video of a conversation between three Congress leaders — Patel, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Hooda, saying that this proves that the giants do not control everything 
 2 aktubar ko sansad parisar main shoot kiye gaye video main, hooda ko patel se shikaayat karte hue suna ja saktaa he ki unki ore se anushansit ummidavaaron ko tikat nahin die gaye
 In this battle between the two sides, many non-aligned leaders have been increasingly marginalized
 do shandaar udhaaharan hai shashi tharur or manish tiwari
 Both former Union ministers were ignored in the Lok Sabha in providing any kind of leadership in the party
 tharur ne kaha ki lagaataar teen loksabhaa chunaav jeetne ke baavjood, party ke haalia chunavi haar ke kaarnon kaa pataa lagane se judi kisi bhi charchaa main unhen shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 Another former Union Minister Salman Khurshid admitted that the party also has a leadership-zero position
 khurshid kehete hai, ''ham vastav main iske vishleshan ke liye ek saath nahin baithe ki aakhir ham kyon haare? hamaari sabase badi samasya he hamaare netaa ne hi kadam peeche khinch liye

 fatullah test ke chauthe din bhartiya gendbaazon ko sirf 30
 Got a chance to bowl 1 over
 isamen se aar aswin or harbhajan singh kii jodi ko 18
 There was a chance to bowl 1 over
 in atharah overon main bhajji or aswin kii jodi ne 53 ran kharch kar 3 wicket jatke
 Although, according to the meteorological estimate, 85 percent rain is being forecast for the fifth day, but if Indra Dev pleased and the weather forecast turned out to be wrong, then Team India's off-spinners pair scored 17 wickets to stop the run
 Can be expected? test cricket main ek hi din 20 wicket girane kaa karnama dhai-darjan baar ho chukaa he
 On the last day of the Fatullah Test, Ashwin and Bhajji will also be eyeing to dismiss Bangladesh twice
 bhartiya gendbaazon ko ye mauqaa mil paaegaa yaa nahin, ye sawaal zaahir taur par bana hua he
 After declaring the innings at 462 on the third day due to rain, captain Virat Kohli brought Bangladesh to bat, there was only hope that the Ashwin and Bhajji pair could cross Naiya
 aswin ne chathe hi over main form main chal rahe tameem iqbaal ko chalata kiya, to harbhajan ne shaayad team ke sabase khataranaak mominul haq ko apana shikaar banaaya
 But after this, the rain unleashed Team India
 baanye haath ke chah bangladeshi ballebaazon ke kilaaf do of spinners kii ranneeti kaam karti to dikhi, lekin in gendbaazon ke liye bhi lagaataar barish ke bich ran rokte hue 17 wicket nikaal paanaa bahut aasaan nahin
 It can be said in favor of Team India that Fatullah's pitch helps the spinners
 yahaan 2005 main hue iklaute test main 37 main se 24 wicket spinners ne hi nikaale the
 The comments yahi vajah he ki daanye haath ke do firaki gendbaazon kii is jodi se mausam ke kilaaf bhi ummid kii ja rahi he
 Ashwin and Bhajji have got the responsibility of putting the opposition team on the bus together after almost two years
 bhajji or aswin kii jodi ko ek saath sirf teen test match khilne kaa mauqaa mila he, jisamen is jodi ne do baar team india ko jeet kaa sehara pahanaaya he
 Now the biggest question is that on the last day of the match, if the weather supports, will these bowlers be able to move forward from history? haalanki mausam vibhaag ke anumaan ke mutabik paanchaven din bhi 85 fisadi barish kii aashaanka jataai ja rahi he, lekin agar indra dev ne krupa kii or mausam vibhag kaa anumaan galat niklaa to kya team india ke of spinners kii jodi se ran rokte hue 17 wicket nikaalane kii ummid kii ja sakati he? It has been two-and-a-half times in Test cricket to fall 20 wickets in a single day
 fatullah test ke aakiri din aswin or bhajji kii nazar bhi bangladesh ko do baar out karne par hogi
 The question remains whether Indian bowlers will get this chance or not
 barish kii vajah se tisare din 462 ke score par pari ghoshit kar captain viraat kohli ne bangladesh ko ballebaazi ke liye utaara, to ek hi ummid thi ki aswin or bhajji kii jodi naiya paar laga sakati he
 Ashwin followed in-form Tamim Iqbal in the sixth over, while Harbhajan made Mominul Haque the victim of perhaps the most dangerous team
 lekin iske baad barish ne team india ko bebas kar diya
 The strategy of two off-spinners against six left-handed Bangladeshi batsmen seemed to work, but it was not very easy for these bowlers to get 17 wickets while stopping runs in the midst of continuous rain
 team india ke paksh main ye baat zarur kahi ja sakati he ki fatullah kii pich spinners ko madad karti he
 In the only Test held in 2005, 24 of 37 wickets were taken by spinners
 tippaniyan This is the reason that this pair of two right-handed bowlers is also expected against the season
 aswin or bhajji ko qareeb do saal baad ek saath vipakshi team ko bas main karne kii zimmedaari mili he
 The pair of Bhajji and Ashwin have got the chance to play only three Test matches together, in which the pair has given the victory to Team India twice
 ab sabase bada sawaal yahi he ki match ke aakiri ek din agar mausam ne saath diya to kya ye gendbaaz itihaas se aage badhane kaa karishma kar sakenge? It has been two-and-a-half times in Test cricket to fall 20 wickets in a single day

 It is a sad thing for him to die
 agar aap ise ek behad khaufnak harakat nahin maanate hai to aap insaan nahin hai
 If you cannot plead for justice to him, then you are of no use
 Imagine what goes through the mind of an 8 yr old as she is drugged, held captive, gang raped over days and then murdered
 If you don't feel her terror, you are not human
 If you don’t demand Asifa get justice, you belong to nothing

 In this, he is seen demanding the Khalistan, referring to the incident of a fight between a Sikh auto driver and police in Mukherjee Nagar, Delhi
 yah videoutubaper bhi khub viral ho rahaa he
 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found in its investigation that the person seen in the viral video is not an Indian Army soldier
 bhartiya sena kii ore se jari taaja bayaan ke anusaar yah koi baharoopiya he
 The archived version of the post can be viewed
 fasebuk pej "ਚੰਡੀਗੜ੍ਹ ਮੋਹਾਲੀ ਦੀਆਂ ਖਬਰਾਂ chandigarh mohali news" par 19 june ko is vyakti ne yah video live kiya tha
 At the beginning of the video, he says in Punjabi: 'I Satveer Singh Indian Army Da Soldier Pilibhit Uttar Pradesh Da Rahn Wala Ya
 ’ kareeb 31 minute ke is live video main vah dilli main sikh auto driver kii pitayee ke maamle par, kuch dinon pehle punjab main ek borwell main gir kar mare chaar saal ke fateh vir singh, desh main sabase bade stechu, chote bacchon se rape, damini cese aadi kaa zikr karte hue khalistaan kii maang karata dikhataa he

 At the same time, some people are now also working to warn others by commenting on this video of him
 AFWA ne fasebuk pej "ਚੰਡੀਗੜ੍ਹ ਮੋਹਾਲੀ ਦੀਆਂ ਖਬਰਾਂ chandigarh mohali news" ko khangaalana shuru kiya to paaya ki yah pej chandigarh—mohali kii khabaren kam detaa he or khalistaani propagenda ko zyada pramot karata he
 Many such posts appeared on the page, which proves this
 yah pej 7 disambar 2017 ko banaaya gaya tha or ise kareeb 23500 log follow karte hai
 We also tried to contact the person seen in the video, but did not succeed
 sampark hone par is artical ko apadet kar diya jayega
 Explain that the dress matching the uniform of the Indian Army is easily available in many places
 haalanki, janvari 2016 main pathankot main airforce stesan par aatanki hamale ke baad sena ne aam janata se apil kii thi ki ve sena kii vardi yaa usase mail khate print vaale dress na pahanen
 The army also made it clear that it is illegal to sell army uniform to an unauthorized person

 So it became clear that the viral video has nothing to do with the Indian Army

 :) # indiaistolerant— Anupam Kher (@anupampkher)november 6, 2015 There has been a ruckus about a government program in Balaghat district, situated on the outskirts of Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh
 is kaarykram main madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan or chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh or aadhyatmik guru shri shri ravishankar ko shirkat kerani he
 But a ruckus like this, Kishivraj Singh has pulled out of the program
 jabaki mukhyamantri raman singh kaa kaarykram tay ho gaya he
 Balaghat district comes under Madhya Pradesh
 aise main vahaan ke mukhyamantri ke kaarykram main shaamil na hone ko lekar raajnneetik khinchataan shuru ho gai he
 The controversy over the organizing of this event has reached the Jabalpur High Court
 is par adaalat main buudhvaar ko sunwaayee hogi
 It is said that the controversy over the venue was so deep that the protocol instructions of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan could not be issued till the last time
 darasalmadhya pradeshke krishi mantri gauri shankar bisen ne apni vidhansabha seat balaghat main do divasiy jaivik aadhyatmik krishi meley kaa aayojan kiya he
 Spiritual Guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar has been invited as the chief guest at this event
 lekin yah puraa kaarykram aayojan sthal ko lekar vivaadon main ghir gaya he
 What is the reason for the controversy, the place where the program is being organized is the open ground of the government school
 is maidan ke chaaron ore chaar bade sarkari skool hai, jahaan dasvin or barahavin kii pariksha sanchalit ho rahi he
 On the other hand, there is a clear order of Madhya Pradesh Public Directorate not to organize such events in the vicinity of the school premises during the examination period
 sarkari aadesh ke baavjood kaarykram ke aayojan ko lekar ek sthaneey vyakti vishaal bisen ne jabalpur hoicourt main ek yachika daayar kar is kaarykram par pabandi lagane kii maang kii he
 He has said in his petition that students will have to face many problems due to the dismantling of the government order
 jabaki mantri ji ko raajnneetik phayda hoga
 The petitioner also accused the administration that it was not able to ensure compliance with government instructions under pressure from the minister
 philhal logon kii nigaah kaarykram ke aayojan ko lekar hoicourt ke faisle par tiki hui he
 According to one information, the Madhya Pradesh Agriculture Department has incurred the cost of organizing the Organic Spiritual Agriculture Fair

 It is worth mentioning that if the government had not brought it in the form of a money bill, then it would not have been able to take it forward if it was rejected by the Upper House

 isamen yah bhi samahit kiya gaya tha ki kisi vyakti ke bare main jaankaree saajha karne kii jaankaree dene vaale panel main sieji, sivisi ko bhi shaamil kiya jaae
 In the Lok Sabha, Jaitley said on these amendments that there were no such provisions in the similar bill brought by the UPA in 2010 and now the Congress is emphasizing these things and is creating complex idioms like public order, public safety, public emergency, the definition of which Is elaborate and may be misused
 unhone kaha ki lok suraksha or saarvajanik apaat sthiti to kahin kanoon vyavastha kii sthiti banane yaa kahin koi aapadaa aane par bhi kisi vyakti kii jaankaree kaa durupyog ho saktaa he
 No member of Congress was present in the House when this Bill came to Lok Sabha
 jetali ne is vidhyek ko dhan vidheyak ke rup main laane kii vipaksh kii aalochanaon ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki is vidheyak kaa makasad sabsidi ke jariye sarkaar dwaara pradutt raashi ko uske sahi hakdaaron tak pahunchaana he

 The Finance Minister said that it is different from that old bill because it has made the provisions of data privacy related to people very strict
 unhone kaha ki upie ke anubhavon se sikh lete hue hamane gopneeyata ke praavdhaanon ko sakht banaaya he
 Only when there is a matter related to national security can a person's data be shared
 rajyasabha main kai sadasyon ne is vidheyak ke kanoon banane kii sthiti main niztaa kii suraksha ko lekar chintaa jataayi
 Jaitley said that biometric data can be shared only in the matter related to national security
 aankade saajha karne kaa faisla sanyukt sachiv rank se upar ke adhikari kar sakenge or cabinet sachiv kii adhyakshata vaali ek samiti isaki samiksha karegi
 Amid Tokatoki's discussion in the Rajya Sabha, Jaitley accused Jairam Ramesh of Congress of disrupting the path of a bill that was originally conceived by the UPA government
 jetali ne kaha ki rashtriya suraksha samvidhan main paribhaashit shabd he jiske apane myne hai or rashtriya suraksha ke sambandh main vyavhaarik hone par hi kuch jaankaree saajha kii ja sakati he
 The comments unhone kaha ki alpiji kaa maamla ek udhaaharan he ki jab isamen pratyaksh nakad antar kii vyavastha jodi gai thi tab kisi kisi ghar main 20-20 gas conection the or sarkaar kii sabsidi kaa paisa, un logon ko mil rahaa tha jo iske hakdaar nahin the

 gujarat chunaav main vot dalane ke liye sirf kuch hi din bache hai
 Promotion of political parties is going on loudly at this time
 congress-bijepi ne apane star prachaarkon ko votaron ko lubhaane ke liye maidan main utaar diya he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also taken charge from Monday
 chunki ye piem modi-amit shah kaa grih rajya he isliye bijepi kii saakh zyada daanv par he
 But in the meantime Modi has launched a new card, once again he has redeemed his connection at the rally
 main gujarat kaa betaa, karj chukaata rahoongasomvaar ko piem modi ne chaar reliyon sambodhit kiya
 One thing that was common in all the pm's speeches was that 'I am the son of Gujarat, the people of Gujarat will not forgive the Congress
 ' modi ne kaha ki congress lagaataar unpar keechad oochaal rahi he, lekin unhen isse fark nahin padataa he
 Modi was repeatedly reminding people in his speeches that Gujarat had brought them up
 gujarat to unke liye maa samaan he
 He will continue to pay his debt throughout his life
 yah pehali dfa nahin he ki modi ne apane bhaashanon ke dauraan us jagah se yaa vahaan ke logon se apana rishta joda ho
 This has happened before also
 maa ganga ne bulaayaa he2014 main jab modi gujarat se nikal kar desh kii raajnneeti main aae to unhone varanasi ko chunaa
 When Modi arrived to enroll, he said that 'he has been called here by Maa Ganga, he has come here on the invitation of Maa Ganga
 ' modi kaa yah bayaan loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan or uske baad bhi kaaphi charchaa main rahaa
 UP adopts me During the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections in 2017, PM also made his special relationship with the people here
 prachaar ke dauraan hardoi raily main modi ne kaha tha ki 'unka janm gujarat main hua he, lekin uttar pradesh ne unhen god liya he
 He is not going to leave his parents
 'PM modi bole- upi ne mujhe god liya, main maa-baap ko chhodane vaala betaa nahiiske alaava bhi apni adhiktar reliyon yaa kaaryakramon main piem modi ne in baton kaa zikr kiya he
 Since he has worked in many places as a Sangh pracharak and BJP worker, Modi goes to most states and says that he has worked here for many years, he knows the people here
 gauratlab he ki modi ek achche vaktaa hai unhen logon ke saath conection bananaa acchhee tareeke se aata he
 This is Modi's unique way of connecting people with himself
 gauratlab he ki gujarat main 9, 14 disambar ko vot daale jaaenge
 The BJP has been in power in the state for the last two decades
 chunki piem modi ne loksabhaa chunaav main gujarat ke vikaas model kii baat kar hi desh se vot batore the, isliye unki saakh kaa sawaal he
 On the other hand, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is roaming all over the state questioning Modi's Gujarat model
 congress ke alaava patidaar netaa hardik patel, dalit netaa jignesh mewaani, alpsankhyak netaa alpesh thakor kii tikdi se paar paanaa is baar bijepi ke liye aasaan nahin hoga

 The name Mayanagari was not found like this
 is shahar main jo ek baar ram gaya to samajho yaheen jam gaya
 But the man who started occupying Mayanagari in the 1980s was named Dawood Ibrahim
 anderworld kii duniya ek aisa naam jisane is mayanagari par hakeekat main raaj kiya
 Dawood's strength became younger Rajan, under the guidance of don Dawood Ibrahim, Mumbai began to dance, and the stature of Chhota Rajan, who has become his special man, will also grow
 assi ke dashak ke aakhir tak daaud kii mumbai main tuuti bolne lagi
 This was the time when the person who was increasing Dawood's fear and Dawood's strength behind the curtain, people started to know him too
 wo naam tha chota rajan
 The trio meant that every don of the underworld and underworld wants to capture Mumbai
 daaud ne hi mumbai par kabja karkedikhaya or uski takat bana chota rajan
 The time also came for a few days in the world of the underworld, when the trio of Dawood Ibrahim, Chhota Rajan and Arun Gawli meant the underworld
 har koi inke naam se dehshat khaane laga tha
 The trio broke up after the murder of Dawoodamarun Gawli's brother who had become King of Mumbai
 lekin chota rajan daaud kaa sabase kareebi bana rahaa
 Chhota Rajan became Dawood's most trusted partner when he stabbed underworld don Karim Lala's nephew Samad Khan
 mumbai ke aakhri pathan don ko thikaane lagane ke baad mumbai kaa king daaud ibrahim ban gaya
 Shakeel had come between dawood-rajan and King Dawood of Salem Mumbai
 lekin chota rajan king ko king banaae rakhane main ahm kirdaar tha
 During this time, between the friendship of Dawood and Chhota Rajan, first Chhota Shakeel and later Abu Salem stepped in
 in donon kii aamad ke baad chota rajan daaud gang main darkinar hone laga
 This was the period when Chhota Rajan started his business in Bangkok
 hindu don banakar ubhara chota rajanaur phir wo din aayaa
 Which changed the world of the underworld
 wo din tha 12 march 1993 kaa
 When the entire city of Mumbai resonated with the blasts
 mumbai blast ne anderworld ke bheetar bhi ek aisi lakeer khinch di, jo dharm ke naam par bant gai thi
 Then the bloody gang war broke out
 chota rajan or daaud aamane saamne aa gaye
 In 1994, Rajan put Dawood's special partner Bakhtiyar Ahmed to death
 is hatya ke baad daaud kaa gussa or bhadak gaya
 By the end of 1995, Chhota Rajan had established himself as a Hindu don
 badal gai thi anderworld kii philosfiyani anderworld kii philosphy badal gai thi
 Mumbai's underworld became international
 us daur ke chota rajan or aaj ke chota rajan ke chehre main bhale hi bahut fark ho lekin us daur ke kai raaj rajan ke seene main aaj bhi dafn hai
 There are many rashes in Rajan's chest, what are the secrets, which are the secrets, the disclosure of which can shake Dawood's cradles and what he is afraid of, due to which Chhota Rajan is afraid of coming to India
 yahi wo sabase bade sawaal hai jiske liye mayanagari mumbai ko intjaar he chota rajan kaa

 Expressing concern over the slow process of negotiations on climate change, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Wednesday that the goal of bringing the global temperature to a valid level was nowhere to be seen

 India understands the importance of creating a strategy to reduce carbon emissions for holistic and sustainable development, and will double its renewal energy capacity by 2017
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, 'samanta ke kisi bhi siddhant ke aadhaar par audyogic rup se viksit deshon ko adhik boj uthaanaa chahie
 These countries are historically responsible for the excessive emission of greenhouse gas and hence should also bear a huge responsibility

 After JJP leader Dushyant Chautala, INLD chiefs Omprakash Chautala and Abhay Singh Chautala want to return to power through the issue of Jat reservation on Chaudhary Devi Lal's birth anniversary
 inelo ne choudhary devilal kii jayanti par buudhvaar ko kaithal main raily karke apane chunavi abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kar di he
 During this, Om Prakash Chautala, who was the four-time Chief Minister of Haryana and Abhay Singh Chautala, attacked the bjp-congress and made promises to the people of the state and showed the picture of the new Haryana
 kaithal main om prakaash chautaala or abhaya chautaala kii pita-putr jodi ne haryana main hui teen baar hinsa ke liye bijepi sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 Referring to the deteriorating situation during the Jat reservation movement, Omprakash Chautala said that the lives of such innocent people have never been lost till date
 unhone kaha ki bijpi sarkaar ne pradesh kaa bhaichara kharaab kiya he
 JJP spokesman Dalveer Dhankhar said that before INLD, Dushyant Chautala raised the issue of debt waiver and Jat reservation for farmers

 BJP took steps for Jat reservation, BJP leader Jawahar Yadav said that the BJP government took concrete steps on the issue of Jat reservation
 jat samudaay ko aarakshan dene ke liye vidhansabha se bill paas karne kaa kaam hamaari sarkaar ne kiya, lekin supreme court main roak lag gai he to isamen hamaari kya galati he
 He said that strict steps were taken during the Jat reservation in view of deteriorating law and order
 haalanki marane vaale logon se hamaari hamadardi he, lekin us vakt ham kya kar sakate the
 He says that we are not like the Congress that like 1984 would have left people to die for innocents on the road
 haryana ke varisht patrkaar pradeep narula ne kaha ki jat samudaay bijepi se naaraaz he, lekin vah kai raajnneetik dalon ke bich banta hua he
 While the other community has a large vote with the BJP
 aise main inelo or jejepi ke is mudde ko uthaane se haryana kii siyasat main bahut bada koi ulatbher nahin lag rahaa he
 How important are Jats in Haryana? Let the people of Jat community in Haryana take to the road many times to demand reservation and many people have lost their lives in it
 aarakshan andolan ke chalate kai karodon rupee kii nijee or sarkari sampatti kaa nuksaan bhi pahunchaa he
 Haryana has around 28 per cent Jat voters and 30 out of 90 assembly seats are in the role of King Maker
 aise main haryana kii siyasat main jaaton kaa 2014 se pehle tak raajnneetik varchasv kaayam tha, lekin bijepi ne gaiyr-jat card khelkar saare raajnneetik sameekaran ko dhwast kar diya he
 In such a situation, once again the demand for Jat reservation is arising, will Inolo and JJP be able to return to their power with the help of this issue? singer abhijit ne mumbai or pune main pakistani ghazal gayak gulam ali kaa concert na karaae jane kaa samarthan kiya he

 aise main chunavi taiyaari ke bajaay gujarat congress ke netaa aapasi ladaai main vyast hai
 In fact, after the resignation of Congress MLA Ashaben Patel from Unja seat in Mehsana district, a group of Congress mlas led by Leader of Opposition Paresh Dhanani had reached Delhi to meet the high command
 iske baad alaakaman ne vivaad sulajhane ke liye gujarat congress ke adhyaksh amit chaawda ko bhi dilli talab kar liya
 But according to sources, in front of Congress treasurer Ahmed Patel and Gujarat in-charge Rajiv Satav, there was a tumult between these two leaders
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik ahamed patel or gujarat congress ke prabharee rajeev saatav jab paresh dhanani or amit chaawda kii baat sun rahe the, usee vakt dono netaaon ke bich kahasuni ho gai
 However, Ahmed Patel asked to settle the matter peacefully considering the seriousness of the case and Rajiv Satav pacified the two leaders face to face
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav ke ain pehle gujarat main congress ke do bade padaadhikariyon kaa is tarah khulkar ulajhna achche sanket nahin hai
 For the last few days in Gujarat, there is a whisper among the leaders that the internal fight of the local leaders is not allowing the Congress to move forward
 darasal 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko pichley paanch saal main sabase zyada 78 site mili thim
 The Gujarat cadre of the Congress was excited
 rajya main mili is jeet ke baad congress kii pradesh ikai main bade pherbadal kiye gaye
 In which state president Bharat Singh Solanki was replaced and Amit Chavda was given the command of the party
 to vahiin shakti singh gohil ko bihar kaa prabharee or alpesh thakor ko sah prabharee banaaya gaya
 But despite being senior in the party, Kunwarji Bavaliya resigned due to lack of responsibility
 vahiin alpesh thakor bhi kuch samay se apni naaraazgi party alaakaman ke saamne jaahir karte aae hai
 It is believed that former president Bharat Singh Solanki is giving this discord in Gujarat Congress
 jabaki paresh dhanani congress vidhayakon or sanghathan ke bich talmail nahin baitha paa rahe
 After the resignation of Congress MLA Ashaben Patel, it is believed that 5 to 6 Congress mlas may resign before the Lok Sabha elections and contest on BJP ticket
 gujarat congress main jari is kalah ke chalate zyaadaatar congressi kaaryakarta pareshaan hai or dhire-dhire party chhod bijepi kaa daaman tham rahe hai
 In the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress has a lot of hope from Gujarat, because the Congress account was not even opened in the last election
 lekin vidhansabha chunaav main party ke achche pradarshan se aas jaagi thi ki aam chunaavon main party kaa pradarshan apekshaakrit behatar rahegaa
 Actress Kareena Kapoor, who is working with Salman Khan in the new film 'bajrangi Bhaijaan', says that she has a good relationship with Salman and the duo seems good on screen
 isse pehle donon kalakaar film 'bodyguard' main saath dikhe the or ab kabir khan ke nirdesan main ban rahi is nai film main ek baar phir saath dikhenge
 Kareena, while not giving much information about the film, said, 'I liked the film (the script) and my character

 bihar ke mujffarpur main 130 se adhik bacchon kii acute incephelitis syndrome se hui maut kii ghatana ne desh kii saarvajanik swasthya sevaaon ko katghare main khadaa kar diya he
 Health services are suffering due to acute shortage of doctors
 desh main visheshgyon kii chhodie, saamaanya chikitsakon kii bhi baari kami he
 To fix the minimum ratio of doctors on the basis of population, more than 40 thousand doctors are needed in the country
 centre sarkaar ne haal main sansad main hue ek sawaal ke jawaab main 29 rajyon or saat centre shasit pradeshon main chikitsakon kii kami ke aankade jari kiye hai
 However, the exact figures of several northeastern states, including Manipur, Meghalaya, are not listed in the list released in Parliament by the central government
 vahiin, sarkaar apane bachaav main allopathy ke saath ayurveda, unani or homeopathy ke bhi chikitsakon ko milakar bataati he ki desh main jansankhya-chikitsak anupaat durust he
 These figures are only due to shortage of doctors in government hospitals
 jabaki yues ke CDDEP kii report kii maane to bharat main chah lakh se zyada chikitsakon kii kami he
 People from poor families have the support of government hospitals for treatment
 kyonki nijee aspataalon main mahangaa ilaaj unke vash kii baat nahin hoti
 In such a situation, the health security of the poor is bound to be affected due to lack of doctors in government hospitals
 mujffarpur main marane vaale bacchon main bhi zyaadaatar garib pariwaron ke hai
 There are 34417 posts of doctors approved in the Primary Health Centers (PHC) of the country, in which 27567 doctors are posted
 is prakaar 8572 chikitsakon ke pad khaali hai
 Similarly, in the Community Health Center (CHC), 17019 physicians are deployed against 17321 posts
 yani siechasi par 2510 chikitsakon kii kami he
 While 24899 doctors are employed as against 28566 sanctioned posts in district hospitals
 kehane kaa matlab he ki jila aspataalon main 3667 pad khaali hai
 While there is a shortage of 7144 doctors in sub divisional level hospitals
 visheshgyon kii baari kamidesh ke sarkari aspataalon main visheshgy chikitsakon kii baari kami he
 According to the Health Ministry data, there should be a total of 22496 specialized doctors in 29 states and seven union territories according to the standards
 ye chikitsak sarjan, prasuti evam stri rog visheshgy, bal rog aadi category ke hai
 It is astonishing that the number of specialist doctors required is not even accepted
 sarkari aankadon ke mutabik visheshgy chikitsakon ke kul 13635 pad hi srujit hai
 In comparison, only 4074 physicians are employed
 yani 10051 pad aadhikarik rup se khaali hai
 Thus, a comparison of the expected physician figures shows that 18422 specialist physicians are needed according to the standard of physician and population
 kya he jansankhya or chikitsakon kaa maanakswasthya mantri dow
 Harsh Vardhan has recently said in response to a question in Parliament that a total of 1146044 allopathic doctors are registered in India under the State Medical Council as on 31 December 2018
 isamen se 80 pratishat uplabdhta ke paimaane se anumaan he ki 9
 17 lakh physicians are employed
 isse desh main chikitsak-jansankhya anupaat 1:1472 hota he
 At the same time, according to World Health Organization Standard 1: 1000, at least one doctor is necessary for one thousand people
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki desh main 7
 There are also 63 lakh Ayurveda, Unani and Homeopathy doctors
 agar inaki 80 pratishat uplabdhta maane to anumaan he ki lagbhag 6
 10 lakh Ayurveda, Unani and Homeopathy (AYUSH) physicians are in active service
 is prakaar elpopathic doctaron ke saath in chikitsakon ko jodne par chikitsak-jansankhya anupaat 1: 884 he
 Which conforms to the WHO standard
 haalanki allopathy chikitsakon ke aankade main unani, ayurveda or homeopathy ke chikitsakon kii sankhya kaa bhi ghalmail kar aankade durust karne se swasthya kshetra ke jaankaar sahamat nahin hai
 The Government Formula to address the crisis of doctors, the Union Government says that health is a state subject
 phir bhi chikitsakon sankhya badhaane ke liye centre sarkaar ne kai kadam uthaae hai
 For example, for all MD, MS courses, the ratio of teachers and students has been increased from 1: 1 to 1: 2 and in Radiotherapy, Forensic Medicine, Surgical, Psychology etc
 the ratio has been increased to 1: 3
 embibies str par pravesh kii adhiktam kshamta ko 150 se badhaakar 250 kar diya gaya

 haalanki, baad main unhone spasht kiya ki border par koi diwaar nahin banaai jaaegi
 Now a petition has been filed in the Supreme Court to build a wall on the Pakistan border

 The Taliban has again issued a decree
 is baar taliban kaa farmaan aayaa he pakistani sena or enjio ke naam
 In Waziristan, dominated by Baitullah Masood, the Taliban has asked the army and NGO to stop charity work in the area
 aisa nahin hone par taliban ne anjaam bhugatne kii dhamkee di he
 At the same time, the Taliban has also asked the charity organizations of Pakistan to stay away from this area
 uttari wajiristaan ke masjidon main jume kii namaaj padhane aae logon ko taliban ne ek parchaa diya he
 This is the threat of Taliban in the same leaflet
 taliban ke farmaan ke mutabik sena wajiristaan main kisi tarah kaa medical camp nahin laga sakati
 Not only this, the Pak Army will also not be allowed to open schools, dig wells and build hospitals in rural areas of Waziristan
 taliban ne dhamkee di he ki agar uske farmaan ko ansuna kar sena yaa kisi enjio ne wajiristaan ke kabaili ilaakon main charity kaa kaam jari rakhaa to iskaa anjaam bura hoga
 The Taliban threat is not limited here
 usne wajiristaan ke logon ko bhi chetavanee di he ki wo sena ke banaae skool or aspataal kii suvidha na uthaaen
 Whoever disobeys it will have to bear the consequences
 darasal paak sena ne taliban ke khilaaf kar diya he jang kaa elaan or taliban ko lagata he ki skool kholane, aspataal banane yaa kuan khodne kii kii aad main paak army wajiristaan main apana shikanja majboot kar sakati he
 That is, in the coming days, a big war that starts in the Swat Valley and the result of this war can decide the picture of Pakistan
 pashchim bengal main jari siyaasi hinsa kii vajah se rajya sarkaar kii sthirataa par sankat ke badal chaa gaye hai
 bjp's state unit and some big party leaders at the center are advocating imposition of President's rule in the state, but there is no consensus in the party about this
 rajyapal kesharinath treepathi ne bengal main kanoon-vyavastha ke masale par pichley dinon piem se baat kii thi
 After this, he also met Home Minister Amit Shah and President Ram Nath Kovind and gave information about the state of the state
 isi din bhaajapa mahasachiv or bengal bhaajapa ke prabharee kailash vijayawargeey ne bhi rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagane kii vakaalat kii
 On Tuesday, Home Minister Amit Shah himself met the President
 unhone bengal ko lekar bhi charchaa kii
 After this, the discussion of imposition of President's rule in the state once again got loud
 bhaajapa sutron kaa kahana he ki guuruuvaar ko party ke kendriya padaadhikariyon, pradesh adhyakshon or rajyon ke prabhariyon ke saath bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah kii baithak main bhi bengal main raashtrapati shashan ko lekar charchaa hui jisamen kuch netaaon ne yah raay vyakt kii ki raashtrapati shashan laga dena chahie
 However, in the meeting itself, some senior leaders opined that it is not right to take a hasty decision, the primary attempt should be to stop incidents of violence
 raashtrapati shashan lagane se bhaajapa ko siyaasi nuksaan ho saktaa he
 It was also said in the meeting that after a long time, people have taken a positive view of the BJP in the state and the party has been successful in winning 18 seats in the Lok Sabha
 aise main logon ke bich yah sanket janaa jaruri he ki bhaajapa, badale kii bhaavana se kaarywai nahin karti he or bhaajapa gambhir party he
 a senior party leader says that basically, the BJP does not remain in favor of dismissing any elected government
 jab bhi centre main bhaajapa kaa shashan rahaa he ki kisi bhi party kii sarkaar ko kisi bhi rajya main barkhaast nahin kiya gaya he
 The BJP has a record that it has been changing the government through elections and not by dropping the government
 haalanki, yah baat bhi ant main rakhi gai ki yadi halaat bekaabu ho gaye to phir centre sarkaar ke paas bengal sarkaar ko barkhaast karne ke alaava koi doosraa chaara nahin bachataa he, lekin philhal halaat aise nahin hai isliye rajya main sthiti ko saamaanya banane kii koshish shuru kar di jaae
 The Governor has called an all-party meeting in the state to discuss this
 *** Varghese Kurian1921-2012 Varghese Kurien is the name of the person who changed the way of thinking
 unke liye sansaadhanviheen garib, berozegaar kisaan kabhi samasya nahin rahe
 He believed that if the farmer had access to the market and technology, he could become a valuable land
 sapana dekhne ke baad ve use saakaar karne se pehle dam nahin lete the
 Like every human being of his type, he was ready to fight but he was not allowed to change himself
 phir amul bharat kii mul bhaavana kaa pratik ban gaya
 If an idea was put in front of them and they would thread it in their perspective, then they would die for it
 pichley ravivaar se ab tak un par likhe gaye tamaam shabdon main se kuch ko yaad karnaa sarthak hoga
 For example, the first word is buffalo
 asian kisaanon kii kheti main bhens ko ek ‘jangi ghode kii pahchaan dilwane kaa shrey courian ko hi jaataa he
 Buffalo was not known by people all over the world because buffalo is not found in Europe and America
 pehali baar unhone mujhe apane kaam se judye ke liye jahaan bulaayaa, vah bhens par ek antarrashtriya conference thi
 Even though we are not able to do much in this direction, but we are among the few countries in the world that spend money on the bio-promotion of buffalo
 or yah sab doodhwaala or unke jujharu logon ke kaaran mumkin ho sakaa he
 We forget that in many cases a woman can also be a farmer
 devaki jain ne is bare main yaadon ko taaja karne vaala lekh likhaa he ki kaise courian kii dilchaspee isamen paidaa hui
 And after a while this thing became part of his psyche
 jo nolej ve gaanv str par baantate the, usase mahilaayein shashakt hoti thim
 He used to say that women can learn about reproduction and will also be able to control this process themselves
 unke vigyaan or patibaddhta ne unhen secular or taarkik banaae rakhaa
 Ila Bhatt has not tied the bridge to praise her
 courian koi khule dimag ke nausikhua bahesbaaj bhar nahin the
 They used to leave it without agreeing
 ek baar ek khoji shaks ne, jo baad main kaaphi mashhoor hua, yah dikhaa diya ki doodh kaa utpaadan badaae se kuch pariwaron main doodh kaa upbhog kam ho jaataa he
 They were uprooted by this
 jab maine unhen bataaya ki is baat main dam he kyonki koi bhi parivaar doodh kii bikri se badi aay kaa istemaal duusari jaruraton ko puraa karne main lagaana chahega
 His answer was that all economists use only language
 ve maanate the ki sahakaari sanstha main niyamit chunaav hone chahie
 Every year his accounts should be checked
 unhen bhrasht or kapati logon se sakht nafrat thi
 The last time he came to a big event called Anand Declaration, where the new generation cooperative institutions were discussed
 unhone saaf kaha thah sudhaar yaa vinaash
 One-third of the income of the rural people comes from milk, and Kurien was the only person to build a successful model
 30 saal pehle unhen ehsaas ho gaya tha ki sirf mashine, technology or sahakaarita se kaam nahin banegaa, is kaam ke liye manageron kii bhi jarurat hogi
 It is quite interesting to hear those early graduates from Irma (institute of Rural Management, Anand) who were inspired by Kurien
 sodhi, shiv kumaar or jane kitne aise naam hai
 He used to teach the youth to do something different
 ve kehete hai, “aap emb ke dauraan gaanv main chaar maheene se zyada vakt bitaate hai
 Like us, if you spend your first few years in the village and take time to solve rural problems, then no one can give you competition
 ” jaahir he irma main placement ke dauraan sirf achche vetan ko hi tarjeeh nahin di jaati, chunauteepurn naukariyaan bhi ek samasya he
 This is the only management institute in the country where if you moved to a multinational company, it would not be happy
 log mujhase poochhate hai, ab aage kya
 Actually, this type of phase never ends
 courian ke dikhaae raste par chalakar rashtriya deyari vikaas board bhi sahakaari sansthaanon, swa sahaayta samoohon or utpaadak companiyon kii baat kar rahaa he
 Many ngos are also working on similar models
 naabard inke liye vittiya utpaada taiyaar kar rahaa he
 But above all, Varghese Kurien has left the biggest legacy for us that our economic reforms should be the path of Swadeshi and we should be a part of globalization on our own terms, provided we have the strength to do so
 jo ise nahin samajhte, ve na sirf courian balki bhartiya itihaas kii ore peeth kar ke khadey hai

 dilli main pani mafia kaa dhandha itnaa failaa hua he ki is dhaandhlee ke saboot satellite camere tak kaid kar rahe hai
 The deserted area near Sector 23-24 of Dwarka is used to run this entire business
 ek janarator kii madad se jhaadiyon kii aad main lagaae gaye saikadon samarcible pump chalaae jate hai
 Aajtak's cameras have been captured, the crude letter of this fraud
 ji haa, ajtak ko aisi kai raseedbook mili he jis par chori ke pani kii boli lagati he
 But here too, wonder why the government and income tax department do not see these black books
 asia kii sabase badi rihaayshi colony dwarka main sabakuch he- oonchi imaaraten, behtareen sadaken lekin pine ke pani ko yahaan ke log saalon se taras rahe hai
 Taking advantage of this scarcity of water, when the water mafia started penetrating the land of Dwarka, a struggle organization filed a written complaint against this black business to the police
 lekin pani mafia itane rasukhdaar hai ki shikaayat ke baavjood pani kaa ye kaala kaarobaar berokatoke chal rahaa he
 Police is worried about the speculation of cricket but nobody is worried about Delhi's land becoming hollow
