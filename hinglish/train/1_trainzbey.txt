 jin paanch rajyon main chunaav hone hai unamem sabase hiprophile uttar pradesh he jo aazaadee ke baad se hi desh kii raajnneeti kii dhuree par rahata he
 In the 2012 assembly elections, the people of Uttar Pradesh gave a majority to Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party but the internal situation of the state and the party itself is not well before the elections
 chachaa shivpal ke saath bhattije akhilesh kii chal rahi nura kushti ne party ke qamar ko chunaav se pehle jhukaa rakhaa he
 Particularly within the party over the last one week, the fighting has made Akhilesh's path difficult for the upcoming elections

 31 disambar 2016:ek din baad ajam khan ke bich bachaav ke baad mulaayam singh ne akhilesh or ramgopal ko waapas party main le liya
 Earlier on this day, Akhilesh called a meeting of his mlas, in which 200 of the 229 mlas of the party attended
 ek tarah se yah akhilesh kaa bataur mukhyamantri shakti pradarshan tha

 isaki tulana main safal purush aavedakon kii sankhya main 35 fisadi kii badhat hui he
 However, according to the total customer base, the number of male borrowers is still very high
 indian express ke anusaar, mahila karj aavedakon ke har saal 86 lakh nae khate khulte hai
 Two-thirds of these women are from Maharashtra and the four southern states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka
 transunion sybil kii sioo harshala chandorkar ne akhbaar se kaha, 'hamen ummid he ki bhavishya main mahilaon dwaara karj ke aavednon main or badhat hogi
 This is because education among women is increasing, consumption of consumer durables is increasing in Tier One and Tier 2 cities and the number of working women is also increasing
 'aaj har chaar karjadharakon main se ek mahila he
 This ratio will change even more as the number of women eligible for loans is increasing faster than men

 basapa adhyaksh mayawati ne madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main congress ke saath gathbandhan nahin karne kaa elaan kiya he
 But the signs of this decision are long term
 isse mahagathbandhan lekar loksabhaa chunaav main utarane kii congress kii koshishon ko jhatka laga he
 If the BSP adopts this kind of attitude even in UP, then the Congress will be isolated in the state
 aise main 2019 ke chunaav main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko apni hi siten bachaane main lohe ke chane chabane pad sakate hai
 Explain that the BJP has made a strategy to surround the Congress in its own fort in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 rahul ko amethi or sonia ko raibareli main maat dene ke liye bijepi lagaataar donon sansadeey siton par sakriy he
 BJP President Amit Shah and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath visited the two areas and brought together leaders close to the 'gandhi family'
 bijepi ke baad agar basapa ne congress se upi main munh pheraa to congress ke liye apana kila bachaana mushkil ho jayega
 In the last Lok Sabha election, the BJP had made efforts to encircle Rahul Gandhi in Amethi, due to which the Congress President was left sweating to save his fort
 2014 main bijepi ne amethi main rahul ke khilaaf smriti irani ko utaara tha
 Rahul was sweating against Smriti Irani to win
 haalat ye ho gai ki priyanka gandhi ko amethi main deraa jamaana padaa
 Apart from this, SP did not field its candidates
 iske baad kahin jaakar rahul ek lakh vot se jeet sake
 Whereas in the earlier elections, Rahul won by more than three lakh votes
 2014 ke chunaav main amethi sansadeey seat par rahul gandhi ko 408651 vot mili the
 At the same time, bjp's Smriti Irani received 300748 votes
 jabaki basapa ummidavaar dharmendra pratap singh ko 57716 vot mili the
 Whereas in 2009 BSP candidates were second and got 93997 votes
 iske alaava 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav amethi main congress kaa khaataa nahin khul sakaa tha
 Whereas BJP had managed to win all the five seats
 smriti irani pichley chaar saal se amethi main sakriy hai
 She is constantly visiting Amethi and continues to surround the Congress high command by raising local issues
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne sonia gandhi ke saamne ajay agarwal ko maidan main utaara tha
 Despite the Modi wave, he could not present a tough challenge to Sonia
 lekin bijepi ko kareeb paune do lakh vot mili the
 However Sonia Gandhi managed to win by over 3 lakh votes
 lekin 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main raibareli kii paanch siton main se congress ko mahaj do siten mili thim
 Apart from this, two seats were won by BJP and one seat by SP
 ab bijepi ne 2019 main raibareli kii gheraabandi karne kaa plan bana rakhaa he
 Under this strategy, BJP has merged MLC Dinesh Pratap Singh with Sonia Gandhi's parliamentary seat
 aise main basapa agar chunaav main utarati he phir sonia ke liye apana kila bachaa paanaa tedi kheer ho jayega
 Interestingly, in both Amethi and Raeberli seats, Dalit and OBC especially Yadav community voters are quite well
 upi main agar congress ke bina sapa or basapa haath milaate hai to aise main donon siten mayawati ke khate main aaengi
 The BSP will field candidates this time as in the previous elections
 aise main basapa ke vot ke saath-saath sapa ke vot bhi use milenge, jisase congress ke liye mushkilen badhengi

 The water drinker feels that if the municipality of the capital of the country has given its license, then the water available on these sites will be pure and drinkable
 agar aapane aisa sochaa he to yah khabar aapako sochane par majaboor kar degi
 You will be surprised to know that when examining 572 water trolleys licensed by the MCD, it was found that none of these trolleys have potable water
 north dilli municipal coppereshan ke nodel athurity dwaara garmiyon main gande pani se hone vaali bimariyon ke rokthaam ke liye ek jaanch samiti banaai gai jisane jab in pani kii troliyon kii jaanch kii to sabhi traliyaan isamen fail ho gai
 The municipality has licensed 1623 trolleys and will be found standing on the roadside in key areas of such trolleys such as Connaught Place, India Gate, Sarojini Nagar Market and many more
 ye traliyaan dilli ke ramnagar market main banaai jaati hai or pani bharne kaa kaam bhi sadar bazaar, ram nagar market or duusare jagahon par kiya jaataa he
 We also went to Ram Nagar market to take stock of such factory from where the trolleys fill the water
 ramnagar bazaar main kai saalon se pani kii factory chalaa rahi misses ratna kaa kahana he ki emsidi kii or doctoron kii team kuch maheenon ke antaraal par har water factory kaa muyna karti he or sab kuch sahi paae jane par hi unako license diya jaataa he
 In such a situation, the investigation of the monitoring committee of MCD itself found the dirty quality of water raises many questions in itself and when we asked this question to Ratna, he just shook his head and avoided this question
 jaanch ke liye banaai gai monitering kamity kii cheirperson vinaa vermani kaa kahana he ki abhi in troliyon ko chetavanee dekar choda gaya he or kuch dinon ke baad dobaaraa auchak nirikshan karaayaa jayega
 If at that time, dirty water was found in these trolleys, then their license would be canceled
 vina vermani ne saaf kiya, 'ham rajdhani kii janata ke sehat ke saath khilwaad nahi hone denge, saaf pani saste daam main muhaiyaa karaane kaa hamaara makasad tha, par agar koi apane munaafe ke liye is tarke kaa kaam karata he to usko baksha nahin jayega

 In such a situation, who is responsible for this mess with the general public of the capital is a big question

 aap dhyaan se dekhoge to aapako pataa chalegaa ki meraa baayan haath puri film main jeb main hi he

 40-year-old Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has to face the political challenge of the Aam Aadmi Party after the Muzaffarnagar riots, surrounded by allegations of sacking of relief camps, deteriorating law and order, excessive spending at the Saifai festival
 akhilesh 16 janvari ko vikaas yojanaon ko teji se daudane ke prayaas main jute the
 During this time, he spoke to India Today's chief correspondent Ashish Mishra in his office at 5 Kalidas Marg, Lucknow, in his official residence
 mujffarnagar dangon ke chaar maah bitne ke baad bhi musalamaanon main sapa sarkaar ko lekar naaraazgi bani hui he
 How to overcome it? After the Muzaffarnagar riots, several delegations who went there met me, our government has started work on their suggestions
 sarkaar peediton ke saath he
 Riots should not be compared but help should be assessed
 main lagaataar mujffarnagar or shamali ke logon se mil rahaa hum
 Calling the riot accused Maulana as a government guest in Lucknow and making a Muslim DGP is an attempt to convince angry Muslims? Let me make one thing clear
 moulana apane kharche par lakhanu aae the na ki sarkari vimaan se
 Whoever the officer is, he has to perform
 aapaki sarkaar ne mujffarnagar ke raahat camp main jabardastee bulldozer kyon chalavaaya or raahat camp khaali na karne waalon par mukademe kyon darj hue?mujffarnagar raahat camp main koi bulldozer nahin chalaa
 To dry the water filled in the relief camp, the local head dug the soil in it and preached that bulldozers have been run there
 mujffarnagar main saare camp khatm ho chuke hai
 Camps will end soon in Shamli
 raahat camp khaali na karne waalon par koi mukadmaa darj nahin hua he
 Yes, there have been complaints that people are threatening the victims to withdraw the case
 aisi khabaren lagaataar aa rahi hai ki danga raahat camp badahaal hai
 Children dying of cold? Some ngos and a political party started telling their news channels, newspapers that the condition of relief camp is very bad
 bachche mar rahe hai
 We asked the people of this team if you have any proposal so that the victims can return home, then no answer came
 camp main rah rahe log sarkari pakke makaanon main janaa nahin chaahate
 So did your government ban a Hindi and an English news channel in UP due to political animosity? Our government did not ban any media
 kuch log is par raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 At the time when children were dying in relief camps in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli, at the same time, in the Saifai festival, crores of rupees were spent
 kharch kar sapa netaaon kaa jashn manaanaa kya jaij tha?saifai mahotsav pichley kai varshon se ho rahaa he
 Both the SP workers and the fair committee raise funds and conduct this program
 mahotsav keval mumbai ke kalakaaron ke liye nahin balki sthaneey chaatro, kalakaaron, khiladinnon, vyapaariyon, kisaanon ke liye mahatvapurn he
 8 crores at the Saifai Festival
 se zyada kharch nahin hua
 In this, one crore rupees is the budget of the government
 kya sarkaar ke mantriyon, vidhayakon kaa is vakt chah deshon ke ‘‘study tour’’ par janaa jaruri tha, janata ko kya phayda hoga?yah ‘‘kaamanwealth parliament association’’ kii pahal he
 Central government gives permission for this
 chah maah se isaki prakriya chal rahi thi
 Such a delegation goes on tour every year
 is daure main mantriyon or vidhayakon ne bhi paisa lagaaya he
 Why did SP national president Mulayam Singh Yadav not visit Muzaffarnagar and Shamli even once after the riots? Mulayam Singh did not meet any other leader as much as he has met with the Maulanas and locals of Muzaffarnagar and Shamli
 kanoon vyavastha ke morche par ab bhi sarkaar kamjor he
 Why are you not successful in stopping the riots and crime? UP is a big state, so some incidents happen here
 lekin kul milakar kanoon vyavastha main sudhaar hua he
 Industrialists have started coming in for investment
 hamaari sarkaar ko is kshetra main lagaataar kuch or prayaas karne honge
 Aam Aadmi Party is hurting the political prospects of regional parties like SP by creating an atmosphere in opposition to Congress and BJP? Aam Aadmi Party has only cap
 sapa ke paas aam aadmi kii topi or cycle, donon hai
 a red cap of SP is equal to 100 white caps of "you"
 aam aadmi ke bich rahanaa, cycle se chalanaa, ye hamaari party kaa tarika he
 You oppose the dynasty of the Congress, but the SP is not behind in dynasticism? In politics politics is benefited from the family but we do not have the dynasty of power
 hamaara sangharsh kaa parivaarwaad he
 We have always opposed dynasticism to power
 ye aarope lagaataar lag rahe hai ki aapaki sarkaar main kai saare mukhyamantri hone se aap kaam nahin kar paa rahe?agar maan liya jaae ki meri sarkaar main paanch mukhyamantri hai lekin news chounal to keval mujhe hi gaali de rahe hai
 Now these allegations have no merit
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle ek baar phir sapa ne atik ahamed jaise bahubaliyon par daanv lagaaya he
 What is the reason for this? There is a question of counting
 loktantr main sir gine jate hai
 This decision will also be counted in victory
 mulaayam singh kai baar pradhanmantri banane kii ichha jataa chuke hai? agar aisa na ho paaya to loksabhaa chunaav baad aap mulaayam singh kii pradesh main kisi bhoomika dekhte hai?mulaayam singh ham sabake preranarot hai
 He never expressed his desire to become Prime Minister
 sapa keval yah chaahati he ki loksabhaa main party kii siten zyada hon
 You say that the SP government is doing a good job but why has not such a perception been formed in the public? Only the public representative of the district where big work is going on is not aware of this
 do varsh main hamane kaam zyada kiya, lekin prachaar kam
 Now i will write a letter to my mlas to tell the public about the government's plans

 When the BJP MLA was talked about this, he said that the Go smugglers of Haryana in Alwar and Bharatpur district of Mewat smuggled cows from far and wide from Marwar and Mewar in Rajasthan and went through the rough route of the village
 Huh
 gaayon ko dekhakar jab unhen roka jaataa he, to ve patharav or firing karte hai
 According to the legislator, similarly, in Yadav Nagar of Ramgarh area, the villagers surrounded the goose smugglers, they threw stones and started firing and fleeing
 tabhi unki gaadi palat gai, jisaki vajah se gotskaron ko chot ai he
 He said, 'I have to say straight away, you will do Gotskari, if you do Gokshi you will die like this because people have love for Gomata and cow is mother

 "input : IANS India, along with 6 other countries, are among the rejecting countries raising objections to the Kashmir report of the United Nations
 human ritis hai kamishnar kii general dibet ke dauraan jab hai kamishnar jed raad al hossain kii likhi report ko bahes ke liye rakhaa gaya tab asia se afghanistan or bhutan samet africa, uresia or latin america deshon ne is report par sawaal uthaate hue riject karne kaa faisla kiya he

 While the report was rejected by Afghanistan and Bhutan in Asian countries, Cuba and Venezuela in Latin American countries have decided to reject the report

 gauratlab he ki 49 pej kii is vivaadit report main kaha gaya he ki line of control ke donon taraf maanavadhikaar ulanghan ke gambhir maamle hai
 Actually, this matter becomes serious for India because at present Pakistan is in the Human Rights Council as a member while India is out of the council from 2018 to 2020
 lihaaja, yuan main bharat ke ripregentative ashok mukherjee kaa maananaa he ki human ritis council main kisi prastaav ko prabhavit karne main bharat kii sthiti pakistan se kharaab he
 Read this: Congress accuse- BJP ruined Kashmir, cannot run away from responsibility, especially in Bhutan's UN Representative Kinga Singye argued that Human Rights High Commissioner has not touched the issue of terrorism in his report
 lihaaja, report ko jamini hakeekat se dur bataate hue bhutan main report ke aadhaar par koi kadam nahin uthaane kii salaah di he
 At the same time, Representative of Mauritius, Israyananda Dalladu said that standing in favor of India, argued that no third party mediation is needed on Kashmir

 This meeting can be gauged through a picture from where the facts have been taken to prepare this disputed report of Human Rights
 vahiin, bharat ne yah bhi daleel di he ki yuan kii yah report hai kamishnar ko mili adhikaar kaa ulanghan bhi he kyonki sanstha ke charter ke mutabik kisi bhi report ko taiyaar karne main sadsy deshon kii samprabhutaa, kshetreey akhandta or adhikaar kshetra kaa dhyaan rakhana jaruri he

 The Delhi High Court is likely to pronounce its verdict on the BMW hit and run case today
 10 janvari 1999 ko subah 4 bajkar 50 minute par bmdablyoo car se hui takkar main 6 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 In this case, the Patiala House court sentenced Sanjeev Nanda, grandson of the late Admiral SM Nanda, to five years of imprisonment
 jabaki rajeev gupta ko ek saal or bholaa nath ko 6 maheene kii sajaa sunai gai thi
 Sanjeev Nanda had filed an appeal in the High Court challenging the decision of the lower court
 apni apil main sanjeev nanda ne kaha he ki faisalaa media ke dabaav main diya gaya tha
 The testimony of Sunil Kulkarni, the main witness in the case, was not in any way reliable because he was not in Delhi on the day of the accident
 jabaki is maamle main galati un logon kii he jinaki maut hui kyonki subah ke paanch baje wo bich sadak main khadey the
 Therefore, Nanda should not have been punished for more than two years
 desh kii satta par kabiz narendra modi ke netritv vaali bijepi sarkaar ko supreme court ne ab tak paanch jatke die hai
 The five rulings delivered by the Supreme Court dampened the aspirations of the Modi government, as the government was engaged in lobbying these cases with its reputation
 collegium vyavastha kaaymmodi sarakarne apana ek saal kaa kaarykaal ko puraa hi kiya tha or jashn main dubi thi, usee dauraan supreme court ne pehla jhatka diya tha
 The Modi government at the Center amended the constitution in 2014 to end the collegium system appointing judges as soon as they assumed power
 isaki jagah neshnal judicial appointment kamishan act (engeesi act) ke tahat jajon kii niyukti karnaa chaahati thi
 The Supreme Court dismissed the government's plea in October 2015 after a long debate, calling the NJAC Act unconstitutional
 isse faisle se puraani jajon dwaara jajon kii niyukti kii collegium vyavastha ko phir se lagu kar diya he
 The Supreme Court's decision was a major setback for the Modi government
 uttarakhand kii bachi sarkarmodi sarkaar ko doosraa jhatka uttarakhand main rashtrapit shashan lagaana manhagaa padaa
 Many Congress mlas joined the BJP in Uttarakhand, due to which the Modi government imposed President's rule, terming Harish Rawat-led government as a minority government
 is faisle kaa modi sarkaar supreme court main bachaav nahin kar pai
 Because of this, in May 2016, the Supreme Court restored Harish Rawat's government, removing President's rule
 arunachal maamle main jhatkaamodi sarkaar ko teesraa jhatka arunachal pradesh main laga
 The Modi government had recommended President's rule on 24 January 2016 citing political deadlock in Arunachal Pradesh
 ye baat congress ko nagavar gujri
 The Congress challenged this decision of the Modi government in the Supreme Court
 iske baad supreme court ne july 2016 main arunachal pradesh main raashtrapati shashan lagu karne modi sarkaar ke faisle ko palat diya
 The government did not ban the purchase and sale of animals
 sarkaar ke is faisle ko madras hai court kii madurai bench ne roak laga diya
 After this, in the month of August, the Supreme Court also implemented the Madras High Court's decision in the country
 modi sarkaar supreme court main kaatane ke liye pashuon kii kharid bikri par bain ke faisla kaa modi sarkaar bachaav nahin kar pai thi
 Privacy Fund has given a big shock to the Modi government on the right of privacy
 supreme court ne modi sarkaar kii sari daleelon ke thukaraate hueprivesi ke adhikarko moulik adhikaar kaa darja mana he
 Whereas, on behalf of the central government, the Attorney General said that the right to privacy in the constitution is neither a fundamental right nor a general right
 aise main supreme court kaa faisla modi sarkaar ke liye bada jhatka he From Patna, the capital of Bihar, in other districts of Bihar, there is a lot of enthusiasm about Independence Day
 yuvaaon kaa utsaah swatantraaa diwas ko lekar is kadar he ki patna sahit bihar ke anya jilon main utsaah se loverej yuvaaon ne tirangaa yatra nikaali

 While taking out the tricolor journey, the surrounding area became resonant with the slogans like Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Vande Mataram

 The tricolor journey gathered like a one-kilometer long tricolor by a roti team in Jehanabad, Bihar
 ek kilometre lamb tirange ko maanav shrinkhalaa ke rup main yatra main shaamil sabhi yuva thame hue the
 The tricolor journey was taken from the Jehanabad District Magistrate's residence to Aerodrum
 is tirangaa yatra main hajaaron kii sankhya main yuva, mahila, skool ke bachche, saamaajik kaaryakartaaon ne bhaag liya
 On the one hand, people of Purnia were disillusioned with the permission to withdraw the tricolor in Patna and Jehanabad, while the earlier permission was given by Purnia to withdraw the tricolor on August 15
 jila prashasan ke achaanak liye gaye is faisle se purniya main logon main maayusi dekhi ja rahi he
 When asked about this, the subdivisional officer of Purnia says that there is a fixed standard for making tricolor flag and the standard of tricolor was not taken into consideration in this journey, hence the yatra was not allowed to be removed

 According to the Election Commission, in 2013 Madhya Pradesh had a total of 4,66,36,788 voters including 22064402 female voters and 24571298 male voters and 1088 other voters

 varsh 2004 main loksabhaa chunaav ke baad sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) kii aguwai ke liye manmohan singh ko namit kiye jane se pehle tatkaaleen raashtrapati apije abdul kalam kai netaaon ke dabaav ke baavjood sonia gandhi ko pradhanmantri kii shapath dilaane ke liye taiyaar ho gaye the
 Kalam's stance on the political situation after the Lok Sabha elections lifted the curtain on the developments at the time, which had led to speculation that he was not in favor of appointing Italy-born Sonia Gandhi as the country's prime minister
 ‘terning points’ naamak apni pustak main raashtrapati ke apane kaarykaal par drushtipaat karte hue kalam ne samaran kiya he ki yadi sonia gandhi ne swayan hi (pradhanmantri pad ke liye) daawa kiya hota, to vah unhen niyukt kar dete, kyonki unke samaksh yahi ekmaatr sanvaidhanik rup se maanya vikalp maujuud tha
 The former president said that he was almost certain that Sonia Gandhi would lead the UPA government, but when the Congress chief nominated Manmohan Singh as the Prime Minister, Rashtrapati Bhavan had to remake the appointment letter
 kalam ne pustak main kaha, ‘us samay kai aisa netaa the jo is anurodh ke saath mujhase milane aae ki main kisi dabaav ke saamne nahin jhukun or shrimati sonia gandhi ko pradhanmantri niyukt karun
 This was a request which is not constitutionally valid
 yadi unhone swayan hi apane liye koi daawa kiya hota to mere paas unhen niyukt karne ke sivaa koi vikalp nahin hota
 He wrote that no party or coalition came forward to form a government for three days after the results of the Lok Sabha elections were declared
 unhone likhaa he ki unhen apane kaarykaal ke dauraan kai kade faisle karne pade
 The former president wrote, 'after knowing the opinions of legal and constitutional experts, i set my mind in a very impartial manner
 in sabhi faislon kaa praathmik lakshya samvidhan kii garima kaa sangrakshan or sanvardhan tathaa use majbootee pradaan karnaa tha
 Describing the 2004 election as an interesting incident, he wrote, "it was a matter of concern for me and i asked my secretaries and i wrote a letter to the largest party to come forward and claim for government formation
" is sthiti main congress sabase bada dal tha
 'kalam has written,' i was told that Sonia Gandhi is meeting me on May 18 at two-quarter past twelve
 vah samay se aayin or akele aane ke bajaay vah dow
 She came with Manmohan Singh and discussed with me
 unhone kaha ki unke paas paryaapt sankhyabal he lekin vah party padaadhikariyon ke hastakshar vaale samarthan patr lekar nahin aayi hai
 "the former president said," she (sonia Gandhi) said that she would bring a letter of support on 19 May
 maine unase poocha ki aapane kyon sthagit kar diya
 We can complete it (formalities related to government formation) this afternoon as well
 vah chali gayin
 Later, i got a message that she would meet me at eight in the evening (the next day)
 ’ jab yah samvaad chal rahaa tha tab kalam ko vibhinn vyaktiyon, sanghathanon or dalon se kai email or patr mili ki unhen sonia gandhi ko pradhanmantri nahin banane dena chahie
 Sonia Gandhi came to Rashtrapati Bhavan with Sonia Gandhi Singh at ninety-eight in the evening on May 19
 kalam ne likhaa he, ‘baithak main paraspar abhivadan ke baad unhone mujhe vibhinn dalon ke samarthan patr dikhaae
 On that i said that is welcome
 aapako jo samay sahi lage raashtrapati bhawan shapath-grahan samaaroh ke liye taiyaar he
 He then told me that he was Dr
 manmohan singh ko bataur pradhanmantri namit karnaa chahengi jo 1991 main aarthik sudhaaron ke shilpi the or bedaag chhavi ke saath congress party ke bharosemand leftinent hai
 'he wrote,' Certainly it was a surprise to me and again to the Rashtrapati Bhavan Secretariat, Dr
 manmohan singh ko bataur pradhanmantri niyukt karne or unhen sheeghra hi sarkaar gathan kaa nyauta dene vaala patr likhnaa padaa
 The former president's book has been published by Harper Collins India and is scheduled to be released next week
 22 may ko manmohan singh ore 67 mantriyon ke shapath grahan samaaroh ke baad kalam ne is baat kii raahat kii saans lee ki yah mahatvapurn kaary antat: puraa ho gaya
 School days are one of the most tense and fun-filled days
 jab class ke kuch padhaaku bacchon main sabhi ko apana taaranhar najar aata tha
 All the students put circles around him as if he will save them from any big trouble
 ab jisane video games khilne or phone par baaten karne kii bajaay kitabon ke saath time bitaayaa ho, uskaa in dinon main hero bananaa to banataa he
 By the way, the funniest scene of school days is of the exam hall
 kai students ke chehre par tension kaa temper dikhaai detaa he to koi bas timopas karne aata he
 If someone is worried about taking an extra copy of another, then fear of failing
 beshak aapane bhi apane skulon ke dinon main aise kai najaare dekhe honge, phir ek baar apni un sabhi yaadon ko taaja kariye

 Facing political criticisms for creating a situation for Urjit Patel's resignation, Jaitley gave examples of former governments, including the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, asking the then RBI governors to resign

" yah arthvyavastha kaa mahatvapurn kshetra he or ise aapako avashya dekhnaa chaiye, aakhir aisa karnaa kis prakaar se ek santhaan ko khatm karnaa kaha ja saktaa he?"report ke anusaar sarkaar nearabiikanoon kii dhara 7 kaa pehali baar upyog karte hue kendriya bank ke saath baatcheet shuru kii thi
 Under this section, the central government can ask the RBI to take steps in public interest

 Apart from this, the concern was also boosted by RBI Deputy Governor Viral Acharya talking about compromising with the autonomy of RBI
 haalanki, jetali ne yah nahin bataaya ki baatcheet kaise shuru kii gayi thi
 In the context of discussions with RBI, Jaitley said, "we are the sovereign government, as far as the management of the economy is concerned, we are the most important side
 " unhone jor dekar kaha ki jahaan tak rin or nakadi kaa sawaal he, arabiai kii yah jimmedaari he
 "we are not taking their actions
 sarkaar ne keval us upaay ke tahat charchaa shuru kii jo charchaa par jor detaa he
 "jaitley said that the country's first Prime Minister Nehru wrote a letter to the RBI stating that economic policies determine the elected government, while RBI has autonomy over monetary policy

 If cricket were a film, Sunil Gavaskar is Sholay — Virender Sehwag (@virendersehwag) July 10, 2016 Let us tell you that Sunil Gavaskar played a cameo in the 1988 film 'malamal', he came as a guest

 world cap 2015main team india kaa final khelnaa tay he! yah baat kisi pandit yaa purv cricketer ne nahin kahi he
 The figures are predicting this
 is baar jabatim india world cap khilne maidan par utari, to kisi ne yah ummid nahin lagaai thi ki bhartiya khilaadiyon ke pradarshan main aisa karishmai badlaav aa jayega
 India first lost the Test series to Australia, then also suffered in the Tri Series
 lekin yah sab jo ho rahaa tha, to parde ke peeche yaheen se team india ke world cap main shandaar pradarshan kii taiyaari bhi chal rahi thi
 In the history of World Cup, Team India has played the final three times so far, in which it has also managed to win the title twice
 1983 main pehali baar bharat ne kapil dev kii captaini main world cap jeeta
 After this, India had to wait for 20 years to play the World Cup final
 2003 main saurav ganguli kii captaini main bharatworld cap ke finalmen pahunchaa lekin vahaan bharat australia se haar gaya
 After this, after eight years in 2011, the Indian team was again in the final of the World Cup and this time Dhoni and company made India the world champion
 itihaas gavaah he ki jab jab team india kisi world cap ke final main pahunchi, usase thik pehle kii siries main use jabardast haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 This time too, just before the World Cup, Mahi's lions piled up badly against Australia and England
 agar ise good lack mana jaae, to is baar bhi team india 1983, 2003 or 2011 kaa karnama doharaate hue final tak kaa safar tay kar sakati he
 The West Indies washed away India before the 1983 World Cup, but the team had become champions 1983 was the year when India, under Kapil Dev's captaincy, first made a mark in the cricket world
 lekin dilachasp baat yah he ki is world se pehle bhartiya team ko westeindies ke haathon westeindies main karaari shikast kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 India lost the three-match series 2–1 there
 westeindies team kii khatarnaak form ko dekhte hue kisi ne sochaa nahin tha ki bharat world cap kii trophy uthayega
 But that defeat before the World Cup proved to be a boon for Team India and for the first time India became the king of world cricket
 2003 world cap se pehle newjiland main haar ke baad har taraf tha niraashaa kaa alam2003 main sachin tendulkar, saurav ganguli, rahul dravid, javagal shrinath or anil kumble jaise star khilaadiyon se saji team india ko world cap ke fevorett ke rup main dekha ja rahaa tha
 But the fate of Team India which happened in New Zealand just before the World Cup, showed the hope extinguished
 bharat vahaan 7 maichon kii vanade siries 5-2 se haar gaya
 But leaving behind New Zealand's performance in the World Cup, Team India traveled to the final
 haalanki final main bharat, australia ke haathon haar gaya
 Here too, the defeat before the World Cup brought good luck for Team India
 2011 world cap se pehle south africa se haare, lekin dobaaraa bane world champion2011 world cap behad khaas tha, kyonki yah mahaan ballebaaj sachin tendulkar kaa aakhri world cap tha
 India was the co-host of this tournament, so expectations were also high that this time India will win the cup
 world cap se thik pehle taiyaariyon ke maddenjar team india south africa pahunchi, lekin vahaan mejabaan team ne bharat ko 5 maichon kii vanade siries main 3-2 se haraa diya
 Once again, the defeat before the World Cup was in India's favor and India again became the World Champion

 is maamle main salmaan ko 6 saal tak kii sazaa ho sakati he

 lekin is maamle main unke khilaaf pukhta saboot isliye bane hai kyonki 3 chashmadid maujuud the
 And the eyewitness has clearly stated in the court that she saw Salman Khan hunting
 vakil ke mutabik, sabhi saboot salmaan ke khilaaf gaye isliye unhen doshi qaraar diya gaya
 The lawyer said that those who have been acquitted will have to give bail bonds
 agar inke khilaaf rajya sarkaar apil karti he to unhen phir hajir hona hoga
 Who said what during the debate on punishment? In the court, Salman Khan's lawyer Hastimal said that he should be punished at least
 kyonki salmaan achche insaan hai, samaaj seva karte hai
 Opposition - On the other hand, government lawyer Bhavani Singh has demanded a 6-year sentence for Salman Khan
 sarkari vakil ne kaha ki salmaan khan adatan apradhi hai
 There have been many such cases, Salman has been committing such crimes
 unhone ye bhi daleel di ki agar bade star ko sazaa milegi to aage se koi bhi is tarah kaa aparaadh nahin karegaa

 Pakistan
 oparation ke puraa hote-hote soobe ke dijipi se lekar desh ke grahamantri tak, sabhi ne ye saafe kar diya is hamale ke peeche pakistan hi he
 One by one, the police and the Swat soldiers again captured the Dinanagar police station of Gurdaspur after the three terrorists piled up, while the evidence scattered around the corpses was showing evidence of Pakistan's misdeeds
 sutron kii maane to police ko inatankiyon ke paas se global pojishning setsyani jeepies haath lage, jo aam taur par pakistan se ghuspaith kar aanevaale aatanki apni lokation samajhane ke liye istemaal kiya karte hai
 On one hand, while security agencies are engaged in data analysis of GPS recovered from them, on the other hand, almost the entire route of their entry into India has been cleared by Pakistan in the investigation
 pakistan ke gaanv se hue the ravanasutron kii maane to ye teenon aatanki ravivaar or somvaar kii darmyaani raat ko pakistan ke shakargarh kasbe ke nazadik gharot gaanv main maujuud lashkar-e-taiyyaba ke camp se hindustan ke liye ravaanaa hue
 After this, taking advantage of the lack of vigilance and bad weather, the three crossed the Ravi river and reached Bamiyal village of Hindustan and then proceeded from there
 vahaan se subah kisi bas yani gaadi main savaar hokar teenon 1-e haive tak pahunche or jammu-kashmir se punjab ke raste phir kai checkposts paar karte hue gurdaspur aa gaye
 But it is surprising that neither the security personnel caught sight of them at night nor they were questioned at any check post
 is baar bhi pakistan ne is hamale main apana haath hone se inkaar kiya he, lekin isahamale se jude subutaise hai, jinhen naa to pakistan jhuthla saktaa he or naa hi koi or

 Terrorists from Pakistan no longer target any one hideout, instead they target several places simultaneously to spread terror more and more
 pehle railway trek par bam bichaana, phir car maalik ko goli, uske baad bas par firing or tab thane par kabza
 The two GPS sets recovered by the terrorists, the AK 47 rifle, 18 magazines and the hand grenades made in China are evidence of deep intrigue in themselves
 ye bhi khulaa sach he ki pakistan china se aslhe letaa rahaa he
 In such a situation, not only Pakistan's hand is clear behind this attack, but the trick of describing them as non-state actors is also exposed
 26-11 kii tarah is baar bhi ye aatanki zyaada der tak sarvive karne ke liye apane saath dry-fruit lekar pahunche the
 The intercepts of the terror agencies had earlier found that they had already got the idea of this attack

 Also, the health department teams are going door-to-door to make people aware, but still not taking the name of dengue sting
 bataa den ki soobe ke mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat khud hi swasthya vibhaag sambhaal rahe hai
 In such a situation, there are question marks on both the government and the administration that despite all the efforts, the sting of dengue is not taking its name

 In such a situation, the health department has become worse

 It will start from April 1
 bajet 2017-18 main teen lakh rupye se adhik ke nakad lenden par roak lagane kaa prastaav he
 Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said that a heavy penalty will be levied on cash transactions, which the person accepts in cash, they will have to pay a penalty equal to that
 unhone udhaaharan dete hue kaha, 'yadi aap chaar lakh rupye nakad sweekaar karte hai to aapako chaar lakh rupye kaa hi jurmaana dena hoga
 Similarly, for taking cash of Rs 50 lakh, the penalty amount will be Rs 50 lakh
 yah jurmaana us vyakti par lagegaa jo nakad sweekaar karegaa
 ' adhiya ne kaha ki yadi aap nakad main koi mahangi ghadi kharidte hai to dukandaar ko yah tex dena hoga
 He said that this provision has been brought to prevent people from cash transactions of large amount
 unhone kaha ki notebandi ke baad khaaton main kaala dhan aayaa he
 Now the government is taking steps to stop its creation in future
 rajasav sachiv adhiya ne kaha ki sarkaar sabhi bade nakad lenden par nigaah rakhegi
 At the same time, it will also prevent suspicious consumption routes through cash
 unhone kaha ki jin logon ke paas baari maatra main behisabi dhan he ve uskaa istemaal chhuttiyon bitaane yaa lagjri utpaada masalan kaaren, ghadiya yaa aabhushan kharidne par karte hai
 The new restrictions on cash mean that such spending paths will be curbed

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has proposed to add section 269 ST to the Income Tax Act in his 2017-18 budget
 isamen kaha gaya he ki koi bhi vyakti ek din main kisi ek vyakti se ekal lenden yaa kisi ek maamle athwa maukey par teen lakh rupye se adhik kii nakadi sweekaar nahin karegaa
 However, this curb will not apply to the government, any banking company, post office savings accounts or cooperative banks
 adhiya ne kaha ki prastaav main teen lakh rupye se adhik kii nakadi lene vaale vyakti par jurmaane kaa praavdhaan he
 The Committee of Chief Ministers, headed by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, in its interim report recommended prohibiting cash transactions exceeding a limit and levying tax on payments exceeding Rs 50,000
 rajasav sachiv hasmukh adhiya ne kaha ki nakad lenden par baari jurmaana lagegaa jo vyakti jitani raashi nakad main sweekaar karegaa, use uske baraabar hi jurmaana dena hoga
 Giving an example, he said, 'if you accept four lakh rupees in cash, then you will have to pay a fine of only four lakh rupees
 isi tarah 50 lakh rupye nakad lene par jurmaana raashi 50 lakh rupye hogi
 The fine will be imposed on the person who accepts the cash
 ' Adhia said that if you buy an expensive watch in cash, then the shopkeeper will have to pay this tax
 unhone kaha ki yah praavdhaan logon ko badi raashi ke nakad lenden se rokane ke liye laayaa gaya he
 He said that black money has come into the accounts after demonetisation
 ab sarkaar bhavishya main iskaa srijan rokane ke liye kadam uthaa rahi he
 Revenue Secretary Adhia said that the government would monitor all major cash transactions
 saath hi vah nakadi ke jariye sandigdh upbhog ke raaston ko bhi rokegi
 He said that people who have huge amounts of unaccounted money use it for spending holidays or buying luxury products like cars, watches or jewelery
 nakadi par nae ankushon kaa matlab he ki is tarah ke kharch ke raaston par roak lagegi
 This will save people from creating black money

 He described Hazrat Mohammad as one of the greatest prophets of God and said that his message deserves praise
 pichhali sunwaayee main jethmalani ne kaha tha ki , 'quran kahati he ki aap agar gyaan kii talash main hai to allaah kii raah par hai
 The ink of a knowledge seeker is greater than the blood of a martyr

 Critics are looking at the judgment from two angles
 Now the critics are looking at this decision in two ways
 kuch aalochak kah rahe hai ki supreme court ne faisla kanoon or kaarnon ke bajaay aasthaa ke aadhaar par liya he
 Some critics are saying that this order is given by looking at majoritarianism
 lekin donon hi nazariye sahi nahin hai
 The verdict of the Supreme Court, given the actual worship that has been going on for centuries, has proved that it has been given more than majoritarianism or minorityism
 yah faisla kanoon se zyada samanta ke ucch siddhant ko lekar diya gaya he
 One community got the disputed land and the other got a five-acre plot
 lekin yah bahusankhyak yaa alpsankhyak ko dekhakar yaa aasthaa ke aadhaar par nahin diya gaya
 The court has given this decision keeping in mind the tradition of actual worship that has been going on for centuries

 But the facts of Ramlala Virajman's lawyers were stronger
 faisle main saaf likhaa he ki yah maamla puratathvik avasheshon ke aadhaar par chal rahaa he
 Its verdict states that our law is based on a multicultural society
 samvidhan ke centre main hameshaa se samanta ko adhikaar diya gaya he
 It is clear from this decision that the law does not give preference to the faith of any one religious part
 faisle main puraane yatra vrutanton kaa zikrafaisle main 1607 se 1611 ke bich wiliam finch or 1766 se 1771 ke bich fadar joseph tiffentheler kii yatra vrutant kaa zikr he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki vivaadit sthaan bhagwaan ram kaa janm sthaan he
 It has always been fulfilling here

 Whose architecture is of Hindu civilization
 jabaki, muslim paksh yah saboot nahin de pai ki 1528 ke baad se teen sadiyon tak masjid kii milkiyat kiski thi
 Or was there ever Namaz recited
 isi aadhaar par is sthal ko bhagwaan ram kaa janmasthal mana gaya
 What was the final verdict? The Hindu side proved that Lord Rama was worshiped even before the mosque at that place
 saath hi hindu paksh ne bahari baraamde main maujuud ram chabutare kii milkiyat ko bhi sabit kiya
 Whereas, the Nirmohi Akhara and Shia Waqf Board's case was quashed
 masjid main 1949 main murti rakhane or 1992 main masjid ko todna gaiyr-kanoonee tha
 Keeping in mind the equality, Sunni Waqf Board ordered to give five acres of land in Ayodhya itself
 supreme court ne sabhi faisla sabooton or tathyon ke aadhaar par diya he na ki aasthaa yaa vishwaas par

 ) Vishwa Hindu Parishad is running a land jihad campaign on the lines of Love Jihad
 iske tahat viechpi ek dharm vishesh ke dharmik sthalon ko hataayega
 The VHP alleges that people of a sect make religious places on the occupation of government land and conduct anti-national activity
 is bare main viechpi ke sah praant sanghathan mantri sudarshan chakra maharaj kaa kahana he ki ek sajeesh ke tahat land jihad hota he
 Religious events are organized by building a tomb at government land, parks, crossroads
 phir isaki aad main keemtee jameenon par ek dharm vishesh ke log kabja kar lete hai
 Sudarshan further said that 2 such cases have been reported in Bijnor of western Uttar Pradesh
 viechpi is tarah kii jameenon kaa pataa lagaakar prashasan or sarkaar ko jaankaree muhaiyaa karaayega
 This will prevent land jihad
 hamen ummid he ki is abhiyaan se kai jaminen bhi kabja mukt ho jaaengi
 At the same time, a member of Bajrang Dal says that people of a particular religion in Hindu-dominated areas organize religious programs under a conspiracy
 phir yahaan dharmik sthal banaakar bazaar ke rate par adhik paise kaa laalach dekar makaan, dukaan yaa jameen kharid lete hai

 VHP leaders believe that Malipara is considered a Hindu dominated area
 yahaan aksar hindu or muslim ke bich rahan-sahan ke alag tareekon ke kaaran vivaad ho jaataa he
 However, after the rescue between the police, the matter was settled and the person of religion did not buy the house
 jamiyat ulema hind ke kadri aamir ajam kaa kahana he ki jo log is tarah ke vivaad ko janm de rahe hai isse do samudaayon ke bich maahaul kharaab hoga

 Two days later, when the bill was passed by both the houses of Parliament and it took the form of law, many parts of Assam and Northeast were burnt

 Meanwhile, a new debate has sprung up across the country on this new amendment as this controversial law has raised many questions over the violation of constitutional provisions and the secular commitment of the country

 Internal partition? India has a long history of harboring refugees who have suffered atrocities elsewhere, but the CAB is strongly opposed as Muslims are excluded from its purview
 loksabhaa main congress sansadeey dal ke netaa adheer ranjan choudhary ne kaha, ''vidheyak na sirf vibhaajankaree he, balki yah hamaare samvidhan kii mul bhaavana par hi kutharaghaat karata he
 This is a step towards creating a 'hindu Rashtra' of the dreams of RSS and BJP
 ''bhaajapa yah kahkar ise aage badha rahi he ki teen muslimbahul deshon ke gaiyr-muslim alpsankhyakon ko apane yahaan sharan dena bharat kii naitik jimmedaari he
 It is also strange that the bill does not mention that it is only for religiously persecuted refugees
 isse is tark kaa khandan hota he ki musalamaanon ko vidheyak ke tahat suraksha kii aavashyaktaa nahin kyonki un muslimbahul deshon main unke dharmik utpeeda kaa saamana karne kii sambhaavna nahin he
 The bjp-led NDA government in the House ruthlessly pushed it forward, ignoring all these underestimates with its numbers
 kendriya grih mantri amit shah ne 'hamen hinduon kii hifaazat kerani hogi' jaise apane tark ko sahi tehraane ke liye loksabhaa main kaha ki congress ne 1947 main dharmik aadhaar par vibhaajan ko sweekaar kar bantwaaraa kiya
 In order to justify his destructive thinking, he kept presenting various statistics that the population of Hindus in India has come down from 84 per cent in 1951 to 79 per cent today, whereas the Muslim population of 9 in 1951
 8 pratishat se badhkar aaj 14
 23 percent
 unhone bhula diya ki iske shuruaati bindu kya the
 Sociologists and experts working on the refugee settlement do not agree with these arguments and they have also condemned the bill

 Shah also tried to justify the CAB by differentiating between 'illegal infiltrators' and 'refugees'
 iske mutabik dharmik utpeeda ke shikaar—uparokt chah dharmon ke log—sharnaarthiyon ke rup main maane jaaenge, jabaki bharat main avaidh rup se pravesh karne vaale anya logon ko ghuspaithiya mana jayega
 This is an argument that has shocked many
 sirf in teen deshon ke sharnaarthiyon par ek vishisht bill kii aavashyaktaa par bhi sawaal uthaae ja rahe hai
 As per the existing rules, refugees from neighboring countries (except Myanmar) can directly seek protection from the government and issue them Foreign Regional Registration Officer (FRRO) documents
 gaiyr-padosi desh or myanmar ke sharnaarthi yuanechasiaar (sanyukt raashtra sharnaarthi ucchayukta) praavdhaanon ke tahat aate hai jo prayek vyakti ke daawey kaa akalan karata he
 The government currently allows all refugees, including Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, to apply for a 'long-term visa' with UNHCR ID, and issue visas after scrutinizing each case separately
 bharat duniya ke un gine-chune deshon main he, jinke paas na to rashtriya sharnaarthi suraksha dhaancha he or na hi koi avrajan niti
 There are certain laws which cover refugees including the Foreigners Registration Act, 1939; The Foreigners Act, 1946 and the Passports Act, 1967
 bharat sanyukt raashtra kii kisi aisi sandhi kaa hastaksharkarta bhi nahin he, isliye yah unase nirdhaarit adhikaron ko pradaan karne ke liye baadhya nahin he

 The Center has refused to give him any relief and many BJP leaders have openly stated that the Rohingya are a threat to national security
 unka kahana he ki yahaan tak ki saudi arab jaise muslim desh bhi unhen apane yahaan nahin ghusane de rahe hai
 The basic logic of the government in all this - there are many countries where Muslims can go, but India is the only country for Hindus
 bhaajapa kii purv sahyogi shivasena bhi is nazariye kaa samarthan to karti he, lekin kahati he ki ''agar siabi kii aad main vot bank kii raajnneeti lakshya he, to yah desh ke hit main nahin he
 Constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap also supports the Sena's apprehension
 unka kahana he ki yah vot bank kii raajnneeti hi he jiske kaaran vidheyak kaa samarthan yaa virodh ho rahaa he
 He says, "the focus of both sides is just on where their political interests are, no one is legally concerned about them
" ''matlab yah ki vidheyak main ve sari baaten maujuud hai jiske aadhaar par use kanoonee rup se supreme court main chunauti di ja sakati he
 Kashyapa says that there are both arguments in favor and against it
 ve bataate hai, ''anuchhed 14 kanoon ke samaksh samanta par jor detaa he lekin supreme court ke kai faisle aae hai jo kehete hai ki samanta ke is adhikaar ke saath uchit vargeekaran ho saktaa he
 In fact, all fundamental rights are subject to proper classification
 is vidheyak ko koi bhi sheersh adaalat main chunauti de saktaa he
 Its future will depend largely on whether the court considers the classification made within this bill appropriate
 ''bengal kii ladyeesiabi ko aage badhaane ke liye bhaajapa ke paas vaicharik or chunavi donon kaaran hai
 The RSS and BJP have long publicly stated their commitment to granting citizenship to Hindu immigrants
 yah 2014 or 2019 ke uske chunavi bhaashanon kaa bhi hissaa tha
 However, the short-term objective seems to woo Hindu 'refugee voters' in West Bengal, who are in substantial numbers in 70 of the state's 294 assembly constituencies and play a decisive role in several constituencies in Assam's Barak Valley and Brahmaputra Valley

 In the neighboring state of Bengal, the state BJP has asked district units to go door-to-door to carry out a campaign to remove the fears of the CAB from the minds of the people
 rajya se party ke saansadon ko bhi is kaam main lagaaya gaya he
 Congress MP from Assam Gaurav Gogoi claims that the CAB is nothing but an exercise to deflect the failure of the NRC in the state, as many of the 19 lakh people excluded from the NRC are genuine Indians
 eiemiem pramukh asaduddin ovaisi, jinhone sansad main vidheyak kii prati bhi phadi thi, iske kattar aalochakon main se ek hai
 He believes that its purpose is only to deprive Muslims of citizenship
 ovaisi kehete hai, ''enarasi ke chashme se siabi ko dekhen
 Of the 19 lakh NRC left in Assam, 5,40,000 are Bengali Hindus
 siabi ke paarit hone ke baad unke khilaaf karrwai band kar di jaaegi; yah keval shesh musalamaanon ke khilaaf jari rakhi jaaegi
 "the CAB certainly caters to a long-standing demand of Hindu refugees from West Bengal, most of whom belong to the Matua community and who migrated from Bangladesh to India after 1971

 Assam Finance Minister Hemant Biswa Sarma did not attempt to hide the bjp's strategy at the India Today East Conclave in Kolkata
 unhone kaha, ''aap pashchim bengal or assam ke liye enarasi tathaa siabi ko combo package maan sakate hai
 TMC is also preparing its strategy
 mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne pehle hi elaan kar diya he ki rajya main enarasi yaa siabi lagu karne kii ijaajat nahin di jaaegi
 TMC leaders believe that their attitude will help the party in 120 seats where minority and refugee population is sufficient

 "while the reason for the fire in Assam is the fear of dividing Bengalis on religious grounds, the people of the Northeast are protesting because they doubt that due to this bill, Bengalis will be dominated in the area
