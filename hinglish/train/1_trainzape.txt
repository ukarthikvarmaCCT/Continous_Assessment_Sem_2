 He is the son of a biology teacher from Aligarh
 chota shahar tha to padhai to thik-thaak thi lekin angreji main haath tang tha
 When he came to Delhi to take an engineering exam to become an engineer, he got a shock
 parchaa angreji main tha
 But the type was objective, so the exam was taken out
 us samay tak yahi lakshya tha ki college ho jaae or acchhee naukari mil jaae
 There is a time for every thought, in the same way, he was interviewed with destiny from the Sunday market of books in Delhi's Darya Ganj

 ’’ unke liye vah mauka hairaan kar dene vaala tha, jab jaik unhen samajhane lage ki unhen paisa unki company se hi lenaa chahie
 There are good investors but interestingly, Vijay could not believe that, so he started voice recording of this opportunity
 ve kehete hai, ''maine sochaa, paise milen yaa na milen, par yah to yaad rahegaa ki jaik maa ne mujhase yah baat kahi thi
 When he got good investment, he decided to make the company a trustworthy and aspirational brand
 iske liye unhone team india ko sponcer karne kii yojana banaai to baat nikali kii yah kam se kam 200 karod ru
 Will have unhone 200 karod ru

 '' kaccha tel kareeb chah saal ke nichle str par pahunch gaya he, antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii keemat lagbhag 45 dollar prati bairal tak pahuch gai hai, bharat kaa aam aadmi bhi ummid lagaae baitha he ki petrol or deazal ke daam bhi desh main jald hi or kam ho jaaenge, to mahangaai se kuch had tak nizaat mil sakegi
 Let's try to understand this game of oil, and let's see what is the reason that crude oil fell so much in the international market
 
 
 pichley chah saalon ke dauraan america shell aayal ke utpaadan main tej vruddhi hui, america kaa gharelu utpaadan doguna ho gaya
 
 
 Oil imports fell sharply there, forcing the oil exporters to find other destinations
 
 
 saudi arab, nigeria or algeria jaise tel niryaatak desh achaanak asian bazaaron ke liye pratispardhaa karne lage, natijatan utpaadakon ko keemat ghataani padi
 
 
 On the other hand, the economic pace of Europe and developing countries has slowed down and vehicles are becoming more energy-efficient, which has reduced the demand for oil
 
 
 abhi tak petroleum niryaatak deshon kaa sanghathan opek daamon ko badhaane ke liye tel utpaadan main giravat kar detaa tha
 
 
 Iran, Venezuela and Algeria are urging OPEC to do so this time as well, but other Gulf countries and Saudi Arabia have refused to do so
 
 
 saudi arab kaa kahana he ki isse antarrashtriya bazaar main uski hissedari giregi or pratidwandiyon ko laabh hoga
 
 
 India will benefit greatly from the fall in crude oil prices
 sarkaar kaa aayaat bill ghatega, sabsidi bill main bhi katautee hogi
 Due to these reasons, the rupee can be strong
 iske alaava petrol or deazal jaise eendhanon ke daamon main or giravat dekhne ko mil sakati he
 Crude oil prices have come down by nearly 60 per cent since June 2014, which has led to further increase in crude selling in the international market
 haal ke maheenon main gasoline ke daamon main prati galen ek dollar se bhi zyaada kii giravat hui he
 The prices of diesel, oil and natural gases have fallen sharply
 in sabake chalate aane vaale maheenon main prati parivaar ausatan ek hazaar dollar tak kii bachat hone kaa anumaan he, or yah phayda duniyabar ke upabhoktaaon ko mil saktaa he
 International conspiracy is also being speculated in this oil game
 mana ja rahaa he ki rus or iran ke aarthik hiton ko prabhavit karne ke liye saudi arab, kuwait or america iske peeche hai
 This is being done to surround Russia on the issue of Ukraine, and Iran on the issue of Iraq, but no concrete evidence has been found of this happening, so whatever it is now, it is good news for the common man

 India's star archer Deepika Kumari has been winning silver in the World Cup for three consecutive years
 bharat ke liye yah ek badi kamyaabi he
 But, one also has to think about how these will turn into silver and gold
 The experts believe that Indian archers need sports, psychologists or psychologists and Deepika does not deny it
 world cap ke final jaise elite toornament main qualifaai karnaa hi kisi teerandaz ke liye fakhr kii baat he
 In such a situation, Fans were raising high hopes from Deepika, who was targeting for the gold medal for the third consecutive time in the Paris World Cup final
 lekin, deepika chook gayi or ek tis ke saath rajat padak par hi kabza jamaa pain
 The good thing is that world number three archer Deepika is realizing that there is a gap between Gold and Silver and it cannot be found without extra effort
 deepika kahati hai, dakshin korea kii ok−hi yun bhi ek acchhee teerandaz hai
 i learn something from them every time
 main koshish kar rahi hum or ek baar unhen zarur haraana chaahuungi
 Coach Dharmendra Tiwari says that Ok-hee Yun is 28 years old while Deepika is only 19 years old
 yahi nahin ok−hi yun ne landan olympix main team kaa swarna or nijee kaansya padak jeeta tha
 He is a very experienced player
 coach dharmendra kehete hai ki deepika darasal anubhav main maat kha gayi
 Deepika missed a crucial shot within the stipulated 20 seconds and missed a great chance to win gold in the World Cup final
 jaankaar maanate hai ki athens olympix se lekar ab tak bhartiya teerandaz kai baar itihaas kaayam karne se chook gaye
 They are all looking for ways to overcome this
 deepika bhi maanati hai ki team ke saath ek sports ciclogist ke hone se kaafii fark aa saktaa he

 There is no doubt that Deepika has done a historic feat and will be appreciated, but it is also true that in many big tournaments, there has been a small miss from the Indian archers and they have suffered big losses
 zaahir he team management or khilaadiyon ko isaki vajahon ko jaanane or us par kadi mehnat karne kii zarurat he
 For an archer, qualifying in an elite tournament like the World Cup finals is a matter of pride
 aise main paris world cap final main lagaataar teesri baar swarna padak ke liye nishaanaa laga rahi deepika se fans badi ummiden laga rahe the
 However, Deepika missed out and could win the silver medal with a tee
 acchhee baat yah he ki world number teen teerandaz deepika yah samaj rahi hai ki gold or silver ke bich ek faaslaa he or ise bina extra koshish ke nahin pata ja saktaa
 Deepika says, Oak-hee Yun of South Korea is also a good archer
 main har baar unase kuch sikhti hum
 i am trying and must defeat them once

 Experts believe that since the Athens Olympics, Indian archers have missed history several times
 ye sab isse ubarne kaa rasta dhundh rahe hai
 Deepika also believes that having a sports psychologist with the team can make a big difference
 teerandaazi sangh ke karta−dharta is zarurat ko jaldi hi puraa karne kaa aashwaasan de rahe hai
 Archery Association of India president VK Malhotra says that he has requested the Sports Authority of India Sai to be a full-time psychologist with the team
 tippaniyan Indian archers are scheduled to take part in the World Championships in Turkey later this month, where they may once again get a chance to test their needs in the test of pressure

 phir chakke se kiya match khatmashanivaar ko zimbabwe ke khilaaf mahendra singh dhoni ne kuch or bhi karnama kiya
 Once again he finished the match with a six
 chakke se match jeetne kaa record pehle hi unke naam he

 Dhoni also became the captain to lead India in a record match in odis
 pichley match main hi yah unhone apane naam kiya he
 Do not get hit by 99! Dhoni will join the club of captains with 100 victories along with the victory over Bangladesh in the quarter-finals of the 2015 World Cup
 lekin agar team india yah match haar jaati he to jis prakaar cricket ke khel main aapane kai khilaadiyon ko ballebaaji karne ke dauraan 99 ran par out hote dekha hoga vaise hi dhoni ko bhi 99 kaa chakkar lag saktaa he
 He has already retired from Test matches and it is being speculated that after this tournament he will retire from odis too

 After this, SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav removed son Akhilesh from the post of state president and handed over the command to Bhai Shivpal
 isse baukhalaaye akhilesh ne chachaa shivpal se sabhi ahm mantralay chin kar kadaa palatwaar kiya tha
 Angry Shivpal resigned from all posts of government and organization after Akhilesh's retaliation
 iske baad samaajawaadee party ke tuutane ke kayaason ke bich mulaayam ne morcha sambhaal liya
 He rejected the decision of son Akhilesh and rejected the brother's resignation
 mulaayam ne party daftar main kaaryakartaaon ke saamne kaha ki gayatri prajapati ke khilaaf kii gai sabhi karrwai radd kii ja rahi he
 He will soon be reinstated as minister
 vahiin, shivpal yadav upi sarkaar main mantri or pradeshdhyaksh bane rahenge

 So later Akhilesh had to take him back to the cabinet

 To solve this problem, Akhilesh decided that all the malls of the state would be closed at night

 Pandit Singh has been accused of threatening the DM and threatening to kill the engineer
 akhilesh ne har baar kaha ki vah aapraadhik chhavi vaale netaaon ko mantrimandal main nahin lenge
 This was the reason that Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya, who came on the CBI radar after the Kunda scandal, did not want to join the cabinet, but under pressure from Mulayam, he had to make Raja Bhaiya a cabinet minister
 akhilesh yadavane cabinet main faisla liya tha ki upi ke vidhayak apni nidhi se 20 lakh rupee tak kii car kharid sakate hai
 But his decision was strongly opposed everywhere
 iske baad party ke samaajawaadee party ke varisht netaaon ke dabaav main unhone apana faisla waapas le liya tha

 He blamed the central government for the country's deteriorating economy and said that the country does not need such a government

 On the record fall of the rupee, he said, 'we do not have the authority to make policy, because the people have not chosen us
 par jinhen chunaa gaya wo sahi faisle nahin kar rahe hai
 If the rupee crosses 100 against the dollar
 tab bhi sarkaar kaa jawaab nahin badalegaa
 Yashwant Sinha also made political stakes during his speech
 unhone kaha ki hamen aisi sarkaar nahin chahie
 Walk to the public, i challenge
 ab janata hi faisla karegi
 But they will not leave the throne
 kyonki sarkaar main rahete hue inhen rojaanaa karodon kii kamai ho rahi he
 There has been a crisis of confidence in the country

 Describing the UPA as the corrupt government of all time, he said, "no such poor and corrupt government has been formed in the country till date

 After this, all the players of the team collectively did similar push-ups after winning this Test which ended in four days
 tab misbah ne pakistani sena ke saath daure se purv camp kaa sandarbh dete hue kaha tha, “hamane lahore main hue skill camp se pehle ebotabad main bhi ek shivi main hissaa liya tha, jahaan ham maidan main utarane se pehle 10 push-ap kiya karte the
 i then promised the soldiers that whenever i hit a century, i would do push-ups in the same way to remind them
 ”baad main pakistani rajanetaaon ko misbah kii yah harakat raas nahin ai or unase is par jawaab talab kiya gaya
 In fact, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) told a committee of parliament due to political pressure that Pakistani cricketers were banned from doing push-ups during the match or when they won

 Highlights of PM Modi's speech at Muzaffarpur rally
 
 
 raily main pahunche piem modi ne bihar ke purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi se kii mulaakaat
 i cannot imagine that such a large number of people have come to see me
 saare raajnneetik pandit dekh len bheed se pataa chal rahaa he agali sarkaar kiski banane vaali he
 People used to make fun of our tweets, today they tweet
 ek vakt tha jab kuch log mujhe bihar nahin aane dete the
 The distance of your loved ones yahaan ke mukhyamantri mere viyog 14 maheene bhi nahin sah paae
 Don't worry, i have come now, you will not have to face much disruption now
 apano se duuri pareshaan karti he
 If i was so bad, i would come in the room and beat me up
 lekin aapane ek vyakti ke kehane par aakar bihar ke vikaas kii raftaar kaa galaa ghont diya
 i am not sad about what you did to us, but what you did to the people of Bihar
 ham jimmedaariyon se bhaagane vaale log nahin hai, jimmevary nibhaane vaale log hai
 Try us once
 aapane gavarnence ke kai model dekhe hai
 Give NDA a chance to serve you once
 jo log kehete hai modi ji ko bihar nahin aane denge, hamen modi ji kii jarurat nahin he
 Will they be able to work properly with the center
 centre sarkaar main zyaadaatar mahatvapurn portpholio bihar ke logon ke paas hai
 The leaders of Bihar are running the whole country
 60 maheene main aapke sapane puure karuunga
 Do not force the public to drink poison
 bihar main logon ko sadak-pani-bijli chahie
 Some leaders of Bihar used to say, if i am not able to give you electricity, i will not ask for votes
 bijli aayi nahin, phir bhi vot maangane aa rahe hai
 Your troubles are left for 100 days
 iske baad aapaki har pareshaani dur hogi
 i became restless due to the persecution of Manjhi
 in logon ne jorge furnandis ji ke saath kya kiya? susheel modi ji ke saath kya kiya? kya aise logon ko maaf karenge
 Nitish stabbed not only mine, but also the people of Bihar
 piem modi ne kaha, argedy kaa matlab hota he 'rojaanaa jangalraj kaa dar'
 This election is a daily election of freedom from the jungle raj
 jab main videsh yatra par bhutan gaya to vahaan hydro electrickplant kaa agreement kiya
 This will provide electricity to Bihar
 main yahaan aapako 24 ghante bijli dene kaa vaada karne aayaa hum
 You need 5000 MW of power, but 300 MW of electricity is not made here
 piem modi ne nitish-lalu par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki in logon ne aapako pichhali sadi main dhakel kar rakhaa he
 Just think how you will charge mobile if you do not have electricity, because how will you watch TV shows like 'saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi'
 ab vah din dur nahin jab bihar main logon ko gas pipeline se gas milegi
 i have given skill development to the leader of Bihar
 abhi loksabhaa chal rahi he, main bol nahin saktaa
 i will announce the package for Bihar as soon as the Parliament session ends
 kisi tractor main ek ingine laga ho to vah dhimaa chalata he, do se raftaar badhati he
 Have given an engine in Delhi, now give an engine in Bihar as well
 vaqt aa chukaa he- apane or apane bacchon ke bhavishya kaa faisla karne kaa

 The story of the death mystery of TV serial Balika Vadhu fame actress Pratyusha Banerjee is still revolving around her boyfriend Rahul Raj Singh
 ek taraf rahul par pratyusha ke doston ke aaropon kaa ambara he
 On the other hand, the suspicion of Mumbai Police is also revolving around Rahul on some questions
 pratyusha kii khudakushi ke baad se police rahul se do baar poochtacha kar chuki he
 In this, Rahul Raj Singh has made many revelations
 rahul raaj singh ke vakil kaa kahana he ki vah mental trama se guzar rahe hai
 He is deeply shocked by Pratyusha's death
 manochikitsakon kii dekharekh main lagaataar unki counselling kii ja rahi he
 Seeing his condition, he has not yet been discharged from the hospital
 vahiin, un par ye aarope lagaaya ja rahaa he ki vah pehle se shaadishuda the
 His wife is in Kolkata
 iskaa sach pratyusha ko pataa chalaa to ise sahan nahin kar pai
 The police questions and Rahul's answers, tell the truth in a series of days, from the Mumbai police-inception to the suicide of Pratyusha? Both Rahul Raj singh-pratyusha and i were in a live-in relationship
 pehali baar meri or pratyusha kii mulaakaat ek soshal program main hui thi
 After that we started talking
 dhire dhire ham donon ko ek duusare se pyaar ho gaya
 After this we started living together
 ham logon ne ek duusare se vaada kiya tha ki ham shaadi karenge
 Two months ago we shifted to flat number 703 of Harmony Residency in Mumbai
 mumbai police-khudakushi se thik pehle aap donon ke bich kya hua tha?rahul raaj singh-ham logon ne guuruuvaar ko ek party rakhi thi
 Drink together till late at night
 iske baad main soya to kaaphi der se uthaa
 It will be around 10 in the morning
 jaise hi meri aankh khuli maine dekha ki pratyusha us vakt bhi drink kar rahi thi
 After this i left from home at around 1
50 pm
 ek ghante baad ghar waapas lautaa
 i rang the house bell
 lekin koi jawaab nahin aayaa
 i thought Pratyusha must be sleeping
 kuch der baad maine phir se ghanti bajaai
 i notice that the door is locked from inside
 flats ke do raste hai
 When the first one did not open, i went to the second door
 rahul ne aage bataaya-is vakt kareeb 4
 Stayed at 30
 phir maine pados main kaam karne vaale cook se daravaaza khulwaaya
 As i entered the house, Pratyusha hung on the ceiling fan
 main jor se chillaaya
 i called my father
 pratyusha ko pankhe se utarkar kokila ben aspataal le gaya
 Doctors at the hospital said Pratyusha is no longer alive
 pratyusha mujhase bahut pyaar karti thi
 There was no fight between Pratyusha and me on the suicide day
 sabakuch normal tha
 Just like everyday main nahin jaanata ki usne ek ghante ke bheetar aise kadam kyon uthaa liya
 We were going to get married in the next 2-3 months
 usne shaadi kaa lahanga bhi silava liya tha
 We were planning to get married on a cruise
 lekin ek sawaal jo police ke jahan main baar-baar khatkata he, wo ye ki party hone ke baad agle din dopaher 1
 By 50, everything was fine between Rahul and Pratyusha, so why did he decide to commit suicide within an hour
 police ko lagata he ki rahul abhi bhi kuch chupa rahaa he
 Rahul's health deteriorated after the question was answered twice
 use aspataal main daakhil kiya gaya
 Now on arrival from the hospital, the police is preparing for questioning again
 rahul se police puch sakati he ye sawaal1- saloni koun he? rahul kaa usase rishta kya he? kya saloni ne rahul or pratyusha se koi jhagada kiya tha? kya uski vajah se hi donon ke bich jhagada hota tha?2- pratyusha ne balika vadhoo se lekar rielity sho power kapal se shoharat ke saath saath karodon rupee bhi kamaaye
 Police wants to know where his money went? 3- Pratyusha is said to have taken a loan of 50-60 lakhs
 ye lone kisase liya tha
 Why was it taken? kya koi usase ye paisa maang rahaa tha? kya lone kii vajah se maansik dabaav main thi?4- jaisaa kii pratyusha ke dost rahul par marpet ke aarope laga rahe hai
 What is the truth of your quarrel between the two? Rahul used to fight Pratyusha, all his friends are blaming Suicide for his boyfriend Rahul Raj Singh
 unka daawa he ki pratyusha ke saath rahul marpet karata tha
 But police have also recorded the statements of 8 watchmen of the building
 jinke hawaale se khabaren aa rahi thim ki unhone rahul ko pratyusha ke saath marpet karte hue dekha he
 But now all these watchmen are saying in front of the police that they did not see Rahul assaulting Pratyusha
 mata-pita par cese karne vaali thi pratyushaavahin, rahul raaj singh ke pita harshavardhan singh bhi pratyusha ke bare main chaunkaane vaala khulaasa karte hue kaha ki pratyusha unke bete rahul se shaadi karnaa chaahati thi
 But his parents were not ready
 wo kehete hai ki pratyusha ne unase ye tak kaha tha ki wo apane mata-pita ke khilaaf cese kar degi
 As far as money is concerned, Pratyusha did not have a separate account of his own
 balki uskaa apane mata-pita ke saath joint account tha
 Rahul's father and lawyer disclosed he said, 'I have given money to Pratyusha many times
 vah rahul se pyaar karti thi
 Both of them wanted to get married
 pichley 10 saal se rahul or pratyusha saath-saath the
 My son was in love
 jo pyaar karata he, wo aisa nahin karegaa
 Apart from this, Rahul's lawyer Neeraj Gupta has also made a big disclosure
 unka kahana he ki pratyusha shaadishuda nahin thi, phir wo rahul ke naam kaa sindur apni maang main lagaati thi
 No complaint filed against Rahul, police says that no such statement or any complaint has been filed by Pratyusha's parents yet, in which they have held Rahul Raj Singh responsible for Pratyusha's suicide
 
 pratyusha kii vakil ne kuch sawaalon ke jawaab jarur maange hai
 In this way, the police has neither received any suicide note, nor any strong evidence that is going against Rahul
 haalanki rahul kii duusari garlfriend saloni kii theory saaf nahin ho rahi he

 India declared their second innings at 106 for 8, on the fourth day of the third Test (AUS vs IND, 3rd Test) against Australia (india tour of Australia, 2018-19) at Melbourne Cricket Ground, Melbourne
 But in these 106 runs Mayank Agarwal showed what level of batsman he is
 kahin se bhi nahin laga ki yah mayankagarwal kaa pehla test match he
 In fact, the manner in which he smashed two sixes to Nathan in the third over of the morning session of the fourth day, proved that Mayank Agarwal is well aware of making fast runs on the occasion of need
 Australian commentator Kerry o'keeffe has landed himself in controversy by stating that Mayank Agarwal's first-class 304* runs came against ‘some canteen people & waiters'
 While Mayank scored 76 on his debut in the Boxing Day match gainst Australia

 or nishchit hi mayank is baat se bahut hi dukhi honge ki vah sirf 8 ran maatr se bhartiya cricket ke tisare special openar banane se chook gaye
 If Mayank Agarwal hits a half-century in the second innings, he is only the third opener in Indian cricket history to have scored a half-century in both innings of a Test before his career

 India has strongly criticized China's attitude at the UN
 jaish sargana masood ajahar par bain lagane ke prastaav par china ne vito laga diya tha
 China had used the veto, in the Security Council, China had said in its clarification that the case of Masood Azhar does not come under the purview of the Security Council
 lekin bharat ne china kii vito kii karrwai ko gairjimmedaarana bataaya
 India has said that it is surprising that China kept the remaining members of the Sanctions Committee in the dark
 antim palon main china ne vito kaa istemaal kiya
 The rest of the members were not told, the reason is that India has shown strict attitude in this matter, saying that no member of the UN was ever told why and why the terrorists were not banned
 Let us tell that China used the veto power to protect Masood from the UN committee
 is par bharat ne kadaa aitraaj jataayaa tha
 Syed Akbaruddin, India's ambassador to the UN, said, "used a hidden veto to ban Masood
" lekin isaki jimmedaari kiski he
 'india placed in open debate' On Thursday, the UN Security Council held an open debate on 'international Peace and Security' with regard to the threat
 akbaruddin ke mutabik, 'world body ke general members ko tebrist ko bain na karne kaa bhi kaaran nahin bataaya gaya
 The committee banning the Taliban, Al Qaeda and ISIS needs to think once again
 'yuan sanstha main bharosa paidaa karbokbaruddin ne kaha- 'yuan cameti kaa kaam bharosa paidaa karnaa he na ki 'hiden vito' ke ishaaron par naachna
 'last month, a decision was to be made on the UN committee to ban Samsood Azhar
 cameti main shaamil 15 main se 14 desh iske haq main the
 Bain was supported by countries such as the US, UK and France
 sirf china ne iske virodh main vito kar diya
 Surprisingly, China did not even give a reason for this
 mana ja rahaa he ki china ne pakistan kii vajah se aisa kiya
 pakistan-china collusion According to the Indian government, China talked to Pakistan before the decision to ban
 bataa den ki pakistan is cameti kaa member nahin he
 So China vetoed the decision and stopped it
 isse pehle bharat ne yuan cameti se kaha tha ki ajahar ko bain na karne se bharat or south asia ke duusare deshon par khatra mandaraata rahegaa

 Gurmeet Ram Rahim is serving a 20-year sentence in Sunaria jail of Rohtak for the rape of two sages
 ek artiai activist ne jail main gurmeet ko mil rahi suvidhaon ko lekar jail prashasan se artiai ke jariye jawaab maanga he
 But to answer this RTI, the jail administration first needs 'permission' of Gurmeet
 jail prashasan ne gurmeet se baqayada chitthee ke jariye 7 din main sahmati / asahmati maangi he
 a copy of this letter has been sent to RTI activist PP Kapoor by the jail administration
 panipat ke samalkha ke rahane vaale artiai activist kapur ne artiai mensunaria jailke adheekshak se poocha tha ki gurmeet ko kis shrenee kii suvidhaayen praapt hai? use khaane main kya-kya diya jaataa he? khaane par kharch raashi kitni he? jail main use kya kaam diya gaya he? jail prashasan ne use kitne bartan, kapade, bistar, dress, kursi, bed yaa furniture diya he?artiai main gurmeet kii shaikshanik yogyata ke bare main bhi sawaal poocha gaya he

 The Danadan encounter continues to make Uttar Pradesh crime-free, but this audio clip, which has become increasingly viral through social media, has exposed the game going on in the name of the encounter in UP
 ek historishiter or police adhikari ke bich kii baatcheet ke audio se khaaki or gundon ke bich sathganth kaa pardaafash ho gaya he
 a few days ago, there was an encounter between Lekhraj and the police in Jhansi
 kareeb aadhe ghante kii firing main lekharaj apane saathiyon or beton ke saath bhaagane main kaamyaab rahaa tha
 After this encounter, a telephonic conversation took place between Sunnit Kumar, in-charge of Muranipur police station and History Sheeter Lekhraj
 viral hue is audio main jhaansi ke mauranipur thane ke prabharee sunit kumaar or ilaake main aatank kaa paryaay ban chuke purv block pramukh lekharaj ke bich baatcheet he
 The audio that went viral has raised questions over the manner in which Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's encounter was being conducted by the police
 sawaal uthne lage hai ki kya yogi kii police encounter ko bhi manage kar rahi he? doosraa ahm sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya police apni manmarjee ke mutabik, jise chaah rahi he use thikaane laga rahi he or jise chaah rahi he bachaa le rahi he?lekin is baatcheet ne jo sabase gambhir sawaal uthaaya he, vah ye ki kya upi historishiter encounter main apni jaan bachaane ke liye netaaon ko khush kar rahe hai? kam se kam is baatcheet se to yahi najar aata he
 The entire conversation of the UP police doing the 'deal of encounter' can be clearly heard in this conversation that the police officer is telling the historyheater that if you surrender or not, you will be killed in the encounter
 vahiin historishiter police adhikari se madad karne ke liye kah rahaa he
 When the History Sheeter Lekhraj asks the police officer to help, the police officer advises him to manage the BJP District President Sanjay Dubey and Babina's BJP MLA Rajiv Singh
 historishiter ne baatcheet main jab bataaya ki BSP or SP sab partiyaan set hai to police adhikari ne kaha ki daur badal chukaa he or uske peeche puri STF kii team lagi hui he
 The police officer told Lekhraj directly that 'next number is yours'
 police adhikari yah bhi bataata he ki badmaash kii lokation tres kii ja rahi he or agar uske saath 20-50 aadmi nahin hue to vah maar diya jayega
 Question on encounter in Yogiraj
 
 
 apane peeche lagi estf ke bare main sun jab historishiter poochta he ki kya sab maar die jaaenge to thana prabharee sunit kumaar use samajhane ke andaaj main kehete hai ki samajhadaar aadmi vah hota he jo samay ke hisaab se khud ko dhaal le
 In this conversation, it has come out very openly that the UP police is killing the miscreants directly to death without giving them a chance to trial as per their basic rights, which has been raised by many human rights organizations
 aakhirkaar historictor apane beton, naati-poton kaa hawala dete hue jab phir se madad karne kii baat kahata he to police adhikari ne achaanak aisa khulaasa kar diya ki sabake hosh ud jaaen
 The police officer said that when the police had gone to encounter Lekhraj in the past, Lekhraj was saved because the police did not deliberately carry weapons but went empty handed
 police adhikari historishiter se kahata he ki uske upar 60 se adhik mukademe hai or vahencounter ke liye sabase phitcs he or upi police ke hathe chadhe to do minute main sabko pat-pat maar diya jayega
 Yes, the police officer does not forget to advise which party is the government in the state and to avoid the encounter, the miscreants have to please the people of which party
 'aaj tak' is audio kii pramanikta kii pushti nahin karata, lekin soshal media main is audio ke viral hone ke baad jhaansi police main hadakamp machaa hua he

 Not only this, it has not had any adverse effect on its body and it is completely healthy

 The comments darasal pakistan main punjab praant ke gujranvala nivasee 50 varshiya mahmud ahamed rojaanaa bhojan ke alaava ped kii shakhaaen or pattiyaan khate hai
 Actually, he says that due to extreme poverty in childhood, he started eating it
 vah ghoda-gaadi chalaate hai
 In this sequence, when he felt hungry on the way, he used to chew tree branches and leaves
 usase unka rasta cat jaataa tha
 In this way, gradually they became habit of eating all this
 haalanki unka kahana he ki ab vah unako paise kii utani killat nahin he or vah rojaanaa chah sau rupee tak kama lete hai lekin ab unki pattiyaan khaane kii aadat ban gai he
 That is why even after getting helpless, they eat them as soon as they get the chance
 doctor bhi is vajah se hairaan he ki vah pichley 25 varshon se aisa kar rahe hai lekin aaj tak kabhi unke swasthya par vipareet asar nahin padaa he
 In fact, 50-year-old Mahmood Ahmed, a resident of Gujranwala in Punjab province in Pakistan, eats tree branches and leaves in addition to food every day
 darasal unka kahana he ki bachapan main behad garibi ke chalate unhone isko khaanaa shuru kiya
 He drives a horse-cart
 is kram main jab unako raste main bhukh lagati to vah ped kii shakhaaen or pattiyaan chabane lagate the
 His path was cut by that
 is tarah dhire-dhire unki yah sab khaane kii aadat banati gai
 Although he says that now he does not have that much money and he earns up to six hundred rupees daily, but now it has become a habit to eat his leaves
 isliye ab bhi aadat se laachaar hokar vah mauka pate hi inako kha lete hai
 The doctor is also surprised that he has been doing this for the last 25 years but till date his health has never been adversely affected

 CM kejariwal ke khilaaf parliament street thane main shikaayat darjenarsi par mukhyamantri kejariwal or bijepi netaaon main chhidi jangnational register of citigen (enarasi) par dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke bayaan par bavaal nahin tham rahaa he
 Now Kapil Mishra has filed a complaint against Kejriwal at the Parliament Street police station
 is shikaayat main kejariwal or saurabh bharadwaj par enarasi ke bare main juthi afvaah failaane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The complaint letter to the police alleged that the two leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party are deliberately trying to spread the rumor, causing confusion among the general public about NRC

 What the Kejriwal Nesikayati letter said that spreading rumors against Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Saurabh Bhardwaj, trying to break the peace, propagating lies through social media and hurting the sentiments of people of up-bihar, Supreme Court An attempt to prevent the implementation of the directive and to create a law and order crisis should be registered
 isse pehle kejariwal ne kaha ki agar dilli main enarasi lagu hui to manoj tiwari ko bhi dilli chhodani padegi
 It was only after this statement that BJP state president Manoj Tiwari hit back at the chief minister and said that Arvind Kejriwal should know that intruders are marked in NRC
 kejariwal par barasate hue bijepi pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne kaha ki wo apane hi desh ke pravaasiyon ko dilli kaa nahin samajhate hai, isse pehle dilli ke siem republic de main parade kaa virodh kar chuke hai

 manoj tiwari ne kaha ki kya bihar, haryana, madhyapradesh kaa ho jane se koi enarasi main aa jaataa he
 Kejriwal should be ashamed of making such statements
 unhen apane pad par bane rahane kaa koi haq nahin he, enarasi kaa matlab sirf unke liye he jo videsh se aate hai

 i admire him for speaking up With the coming of Lok Sabha elections, the words of leaders have become unbridled
 saharanpur se congress ke loksabhaa pratyaashee imran masood ne ek raily main kaha he ki wo bijepi ke piem pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ke tukade tukade kar denge
 a case has been registered against Masood for this fire-burning statement
 masood ek video main janata ke saamne yah kah rahe hai ki main modi ko chote chote tukdon main kaat daaloongaa
 i will teach them such a lesson that they will remember
 imran video main kah rahe hai ki upi gujarat nahin he
 Gujarat has only four percent Muslims, UP has twenty two percent Muslims
 main use aisa sabak sikhaauungaa ki vah yaad rakhega
 The Election Commission has called for Imran's pitch
 haalanki congress ne apane is netaa ke bayaan par abhi tak koi tippanee nahin kii he
 Imran is the nephew of Congress leader Rashid Masood
 sapa ke tikat par saharanpur se rashid ke bete shajaan masood maidan main hai
 However, if Siyasat
com is believed, Masood says that his video is old
 unhone yah bhi spasht kiya ki unke kehane kaa matlab yah he ki vah modi ko loktantric tareeke se sabak sikhayenge
 Masood has refused to apologize for his absurd statement
 haalanki unhone kaha ki main modi se maafee tabhi maanguga jab wo gujarat dangon ke liye maafee maangenge
 Watch the controversial video of Imran Masood: a case registered under these sections Saharanpur District Magistrate and District Election Officer Sandhya Tiwari said that the recording of CD and Masood's statement has been received by him and has been sent to the Election Commission
 jila adhikariyon ne kaha ki masood par ipisi kii dhara 153 e (vibhinn samoohon ke bich vaimnasy failaane), dhara 295e (jaanboojh kar dharmik bhaavana bhadakaane), dhara 504 (jaanboojh kar apmaan kar shanti bhang karnaa), dhara 506 (aapraadhik bhayadohan) ke tahat maamla darj kiya gaya he
 Demanding action from the Election Commission, the BJP has condemned Masood's remarks and asked the Election Commission to take strict cognizance and ensure the safety of all leaders including Modi
 bijepi upaadhyaksh mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne kaha ki bijepi kaa ucchstareey shishtmandal shanivaar ko chunaav ayog se milakar is baat kii shikaayat karegaa or congress pratyaashee masood ke khilaaf sakht evam spasht karrwai karne kii maang karegaa
 Condemning Masood's remarks, he said that the 'political secularism' of the desperate and frustrated Congress has now been converted into 'taliban secularism'
 jis tarah se congress ke kuch netaa talibani bhashaa kaa istemaal kar rahe hai, usase chunaav ke samay saamaajik sauhaard or shanti ko chot pahunch rahi he or araajaktaa failane kaa khatra he

 Characters you enact , at times make you re-visit your own grief # actordiaries 
 At times we also take a lot of hatred too that comes our way but we are performers
 Our roles on-screen do not define the individual that we are off screen 
 As an individual we might not relate with every character we play on screen but in the world such characters exist, that's why they are written
 Kudos to the entire cast & crew & many many thanks to Patiala Babes fans 
 Keep loving 🥰, keep sharing
 Your comments encourage us 🙏🏻

 Earlier, Haryana Chief Minister and BJP leader Manohar Lal Khattar had said that the Modi government has increased India's stature around the world as the country is always paramount for this while the Congress cannot think ahead of the nehru-gandhi family
 khatter ne ambala jile ke naaraingarh main ek chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha ki jab ham kehete hai ki kise praathamikta di jaani chahie, ham kehete hai ki desh hameshaa sabase pehle aata he

 'unhone kaha ki congress nehru gandhi parivaar ke aage soch hi nahin sakati he
 Khattar had said that the (then) Congress president (rahul Gandhi) said that (after a crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections) he has resigned and that the new chief would be a person outside the Gandhi family
 congress ne do maheene kaa samay liya lekin unhen is parivaar se baahar kaa koi yogya vyakti nahin mila or sonia gandhi ko phir se adhyaksh bana diya gaya
 However, he said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has increased the stature of the country around the world and it was seen during the Howdy Modi program in Houston, USA

 haadase main ab tak 10 logon kii maut ho chuki he or kareeb 100 ke kareeb jakhmi hai
 a horrific rail accident occurred in Sintheri, Tamil Nadu on Tuesday night
 haadasa kii bheeshanta kaa pataa isi se chalata he ki ghatnasthal par kahin musafiron ke shav bogi ke neeche fanse hue hai to kahin train ke toote purje bikhare pade hai
 The accident took place around 9 pm on Tuesday night near Satheri railway station adjacent to Arakkonam, about 75 km from Chennai
 sitheri arakonam se kareeb paanch kilometre dur he
 arakkonam-vellore passenger train was opened from Arakkonam
 signal red hone kii vajah se train sitheri stesan ke paas khadi ho gai
 On the other hand, the EMU train going to Vellore opened from Chennai Beach and hit the arakkonam-vellore passenger train standing near the Satheri station waiting for the signal
 takkar itani joardaar tha ki donon trainon kii paanch bogiyaan patari se utar gayi
 Passenger train was the biggest loser among them
 train kii paanch bogiyaan to itani buree tarah pichak gayi ki logon ko nikaalane ke liye gas kattar se inhen kaatna padaa
 On receiving the news of the accident, two columns of the relief train and National Disaster Response Force were dispatched to the spot
 kuch ghante baad andiaref kii do or team ko ghatnasthal par bhej diya gaya
 Navy team from INS Rajali Naval Base reached the spot for rescue work
 haalanki, tej barish or andhere kii vajah se raahat or bachaav kaary main mushkilen ain lekin rescue team mustaidi se lagi rahi or kareeb teen ghante ke bheetar train main fanse tamaam logon ko baahar nikaalkar arakonam, vellore or chennai ke aspataalon main pahunchaa diya gaya
 However, the question arises that when the passenger train was waiting for the signal, how did the EMU train arrive on the same track? Immediately after the accident, the Railway Board chairman, who came to the media with the Railway Minister in Delhi, indicated that the reason for the accident could be human error
 rail mantri ke mutabik haadase ke vakt signal main koi kharabi nahin thi
 Therefore, it is a matter of investigation how the EMU train got on the same track
 saubhaahgya se iemyu train kaa driver salaamat he
 However, he is not in a position to make a statement due to being seriously injured
 baharhaal, saans ke pareekshan se saaf hua he ki driver nashe main nahin tha
 According to the Railway Minister, the driver of the EMU train returned to duty after a 16-hour rest
 aise main thakaan kii theory bhi galat he
 Obviously, the secret of the accident will be revealed after the driver's statement
 railway kaa kahana he ki iemyu train ke driver kii galati se haadasa hua
 According to the General Manager of Southern Railway, the driver was driving the train at a higher speed than the prescribed limit
 haadase ke vakt train kii raftaar 90 kilometre prati ghanta thi, lekin sitheri main jahaan haadasa hua vahaan train kii raftaar pandrah kilometre prati ghanta se zyada nahin hona chahie tha
 Not only this, the driver also ignored the signal
 railway ke mutabik driver ne chaar yelo signal ko todaa or paisanger train main takkar maarane se pehle red signal ko bhi todaa
 About 100 people were injured in the train accident
 jakhmi logon kaa alag-alag aspataalon main ilaaj chal rahaa he
 25 people have been admitted to the government hospital in Chennai, while the rest of the injured have been admitted to hospitals in Vellore and Arakkonam
 is bich, railway ne muaavje kaa elaan kar diya he
 Five lakh rupees will be given to the family of the dead, one lakh rupees to the severely injured passengers and 25 thousand rupees to the moderately injured passengers

 Anand Pradhan, husband of '43-year-old Amrita Rai, is an associate professor at IIMC
 vahiin, 67 saal ke digvijay singh kii patni aashaa singh kaa pichley saal cancer se nidhan ho gaya tha
 Anand Pradhan's response to the entire episode: There are many comments on social sites on this entire episode
 khud anand pradhan ne fasebuk par post likhakar apni baat rakhin
 He wrote this in his Facebook post - i am going through a lot of difficulty and trouble
 yah mere liye pariksha kii ghadi he
 Me and Amrita have been living apart for a long time and have applied for divorce with mutual consent
 ek kanoonee prakriya he jo samay leti he lekin hamaare bich sambandh bahut pehle se hi khatm ho chuke hai
 After separation, Amrita is free to take any decision regarding her future life and i respect her
 unhen bhavishya ke jivan ke liye meri shubhakamanaayen hai
 i know that many of my friends, well wishers, students and colleagues are sad and sad for me
 lekin mujhe yah bhi maaloom he ki ve mere saath khadey hai

 But those who are not ready to see the nuances of man-to-woman relationship and the independent existence and personality of woman out of feudal and patriarchal thinking, do not consider it more than property and child-bearing machine and not respect for her dignity
 For them, it is a chance for them to crackle up, poke fun, slime and make personal attacks
 lekin ve yahi jaanate hai
 This is the limit of his thinking and politics
 unase isse zyada kii apeksha bhi nahin
 The video that was put on youtube of Digvijay Singh and Amrita Rai together worshiping shaayad aapane bhi logon ko ye kehete suna hoga ki har samay helmet pahane rahane se baalo ke jhadane kii problem ho jaati he
 It is believed that wearing a helmet for hours every day causes hair to fall rapidly
 darasal, har roj ghanton helmet pahanane se scalp par ragad hoti he jisase baalo kii jaden kamjor ho jaati hai
 Wearing helmets for hours also increases the chances of bacteria flourishing
 agar aap saalon se lagaataar helmet pahante aa rahe hai to aapako bhi apane baalo main kami dikhaai di hogi
 But if you want, you can prevent hair fall by showing some care and alertness
 helmet kii scalp se ragad ke is process ko traction alopecia kaha jaataa he
 On the one hand, while hair loss starts, on the other hand it also affects the growth of new hair
 traction alopecia kaa asar aap un logon main bhi dekh sakate hai jo apane baalo ko kasakar baandhte hai
 If wearing a helmet is your compulsion and without it you cannot work, then it is important that you take some precautions
 sabase pehle to ashyor kar len ki aapke bal bahut tite nahin bandhe hon
 The way you wear your helmet also affects
 helmet ko aage kii ore se thodaa uthaa hua rahane den or peeche kii ore dabaa hua
 This will continue to provide air, or the absence of air will increase the possibility of bacteria to flourish
 iske alaava aapkaa sahi khanpan bhi bahut jaruri he
 But if you sweat a lot, then try to clean the helmet with anti-bacterial liquid once or twice a day
 koshish karen ki helmet main nami nahin rahane paae
 Applying a helmet also affects the growth of new hair
 aise main jaruri he ki aap samay-samay par baalo kii massage karte karen kyonkimsage karne se blad cirkulation badhata hajisase nae bal aate hai
 Now whenever you ride a bike, wear a helmet but clean and free of bacteria
