 upi ke siem yogi adityanath apane ek saal ke kaarykaal main kaaphi sanbhal kar bolte dekhe gaye hai
 Due to the recent movement of Dalits, a lot of ruckus occurred in many districts
 kai sawaalon ko lekar pradesh ke daliton main gussa dekha ja saktaa he, lekin siem yogi kaa kahana he ki pradesh ke daliton main kisi tarah kaa gussa nahin he or yah kuch logon kii sajeesh he
 CM Yogi spoke to India Today Group Editorial Director Raj Chengappa, India Today Hindi Editor Anshuman Tiwari and Lucknow correspondent Ashish Mishra on a wide range of issues
 badhata jatigat takaravaupi main jatigat takaraav bad rahaa he
 The recent Dalit movement is an example of this
 is bare main upi sarkaar kya kar rahi he, is sawaal par siem ne kaha, 'rajya main kabhi bhi savarnon or anusuchit jati kaa takaraav nahin dekha gaya he
 There are 75 districts in UP; during the recent Bharat Bandh, only three-four districts have caused a ruckus
 in ghatnaon ke peeche jatigat takaraav nahin he
 Those who are plotting violence in the name of Dalits have been exposed
 hamane unke khilaaf sakht karrwai kii he
 Then the question arises as to why there is so much anger among Dalits, to which CM Yogi said, 'this is not a matter of Dalit anger
 yah un logon kaa pryojit drama he, jo dalit masale kaa raajnneetikaran karnaa chaahate hai yaa unako mohare kii tarah istemaal karnaa chaahate hai
 No one else has done as much as BJP has done for Dalits
 'essi-asti act ke bare menkya aapako lagata he ki essi-asti atyaachaar adhinium ke bare main supreme court ke nirnay par daliton kaa gussa jaij he, is sawaal par yogi adityanath ne kaha, 'loktantr main har kisi ko apane vichaar prakat karne kaa adhikaar he
 But those who resort to violent demonstrations in the name of Dalits will be busted
 unke asli iraadon kaa ek din pataa chal hi jayega
 The CM said, 'the second thing is that the decision of the Supreme Court is not new
 kareeb 11 saal pehlemayawati sarkaarne aisa hi aadesh paarit kiya tha
 The Central Government has also given the assurance that it will file a review petition in the Supreme Court
 'baba sahab ke naam main 'raamji ' jodne paraupi sarkaar ne baba sahab ambedkar ke naam main 'raamji' jod diya he, kya yah pratikwaad kii raajnneeti nahin he, is sawaal par yogi ne kaha ki is bare main do prastaav sarkaar ko mili the
 He said, 'the first proposal came from the Governor that his name is' Ambedkar', not 'ambedkar' and Baba Saheb made his signature in the original copy of the Constitution as' Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar ', hence his name That should be it
 doosraa prastaaombedkar mahasabhaki taraf se aayaa, jisamen yah anurodh kiya gaya ki rajya sarkaar ke sabhi karyaalayon main baba sahab kii tasviir honi chahie

 For the party, i faced a lot of hate speech and scuffle, but still no concrete action was taken with those who threatened me inside the party
 vah bahut durbhagyapurna hai

 kuch din pehle hi unhone party kii ore se press confeence karte hue kendriya mantri smriti irani par nishane sadhate hue 'kyon ki mantri bhi graduate thim' gaanaa gaya tha jo smriti irani ke serial kyonki saas bhi kabhi bahu ke tital sang kii tarj par tha
 It's a pity @ priyankac19 will not be seen defending the Congress on our TV screens any longer
 She was an asset to the party & a fearless advocate for the party & its leadership
 To have lost her to selfish personal interests would have been no loss but to lose her because she felt her party did not stand up for her is all the more unfortunate

 "the bloody game and the bad situation in the valley in the 90s in Jammu and Kashmir has been described in similar words by former Governor Jagmohan
 anuchhed 370 par uthaae gaye modi sarkaar ke faisle se jammu-kashmir kaa maamla surkhiyon main he
 During his stay there, Jagmohan had a close look at the creepy atmosphere of the valley
 ghati kii krur siyasat se lekar hinsak ghatnaon ko vah apni kitaab 'dahakate angaare' main bayaan kar chuke hai
 Jagmohan was the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir at a time when scorching of the valley was intensifying in the fire of terrorism and violence
 1984 se 1990 tak vah rajyapal rahe
 He was the Governor from April 1984 to June 1989 and again from January 1990 to May 1990
 yah jagmohan hi the, jinhone rajyapal rahete faruk abdulla kii sarkaar ko barkhaast kar diya tha
 In his book covering the events up to 1994, Jagmohan wrote, "what Kashmir is today is the byproduct of debris and tragic plays of all the events, betrayals and conspiracies that have taken place during the long journey of two thousand years of its history
 
 itihaas dwaara use maare gaye anek ghaav ab bhi taaja bane hue hai
 In the middle of 1947, at the turning point of his history, he needed a physician who could sew his old wounds and healed the stains

 "when the officer left because of fear," Padjagmohan writes - i appointed retired director general Pir Ghulam Hasan Shah as an advisor
 shah ko cabinet mantri bhi bana diya
 But by midday, Shah's mind started changing and he told that he could not handle this post
 kyonki isse unke parivaar kii jaan khatre main pad jaaegi
 At that time i felt how strong the grip of terrorists was
 gulam hasan shah jaise afasar bhi pad chhodane ko majaboor ho rahe hai
 Jagmohan writes that we relied on false ideals and false gods
 hamane un jadon kii taraf dhyaan hi nahin diya
 Which was bursting under the surface

 We let it mite

 Misuse of Section 370: Discrimination against Officers How the discrimination in Jammu and Kashmir under the garb of Article 370
 aise kai kisse jagmohan kii kitaab main hai
 He writes that some officers of the All India Service formed a cooperative society for their residence
 unhone rajtarangini naam se is socity kaa panjikaran kiya
 Then the leaders of National Conference named Abdul Rashid and Sharifuddin Shariq in 1988 created a ruckus in the state assembly by raising the matter
 afasaron kii tulana east india company se kii or ise aabaadi ke santulan ko palatney kii sajeesh bataaya
 Demanded for trial
 jisase afasaron ko socity ko bhang karnaa padaa
 His land also went away
 jagmohan likhte hai ki sochie, sirf 32 adhikariyon kii awaas samiti main hi unhen kashmir kaa upnivesh banane kii jhalak dikhaai dene lagi thi
 When this society of 32 officers was formed, the population of Kashmir was 70 lakhs
 rahane ke liye afasaron ne thodi si jameen kya maangi ki hangaamaa kar diya gaya
 According to Jagmohan, the National Conference and other allies worked to incite the public through such sentiments
 isi tarah jagmohan ek or vakya bataate hai
 He says in the book that the central government passed a bill in 1988 to stop the misuse of religious institutions
 370 ke kaaran jammu-kashmir ko chhodkar sabhi jagah yah kanoon lagu hua

 The slogans outside the mosque in the Delhi Shahdara area on the day of Ramnavmi have now taken a political form
 aam aadmi party ke vidhayak amanatulla ne us ghatana ko bijepi kii sajish qaraar diya to vahiin bijepi ne aap ke khilaaf us ghatana ke saboot laakar aam aadmi party kii pole khol di he
 We talked to Wasim, the secretary of the mosque in Shahdara, about what happened on the day of Ramnavmi in the mosque in Shahdara area, and he admitted that an attempt was made to report the atmosphere outside the mosque on the day of Ramnavami
 ek samaaj kii bhaawanaaon ko aahat kiya gaya
 Wrong slogans were raised outside the mosque
 saath hi masjid ke secretary ne ye bhi mana ki jo tasviir media main saamne aa rahi he, us ek tasviir main maujuud shaks ko unhone ilaake keam aadmi partike vidhayak or vidhansabha ke adhyaksh ram nivas goyal ke saath dekha he
 This statement of the mosque's secretary is nothing short of a new problem for the common man, because the charge that the Aam Aadmi Party is making on the BJP, is rejecting the statement of the mosque's secretary Wasim, and the government's allegations were defied somewhere
 is
 haalanki kai logon ne unako pahunchane se manaa bhi kiya
 Who were those who believe that the RWA president of Ilake Rajesh Tiwari, who came to the procession on the day of Ramnavami, showed swords outside the mosque for 15 minutes and also raised communal slogans, which was going to spoil the atmosphere of the area
 vahaan rahane vaale logon ne ye bhi mana ki jab bhi desh main yaa kahin bhi hindu-musalmaan ke bich koi vivaad hota he, us vakt bhi is ilaake main kuch nahin hota
 The people of the area say that the political parties in Delhi who are doing politics about this procession are wrong
 uttar pradesh ke bijanour main indian railway kii badi laaparvaahee ujagar hui he

 Due to this negligence of the signal in-charge, three trains did not get the signal of line clearing, due to which they had to stop on the way

 Along with this, his medical was also done and an inquiry has been ordered against him
 karnataka kaa siyaasi ganit ulajhata hi ja rahaa he
 The decision has been reserved by the Supreme Court on the resignation of rebel mlas of congress-jds and a decision will be taken today

 vidhansabha spikar ko yah sahuuliyat 18 farvari 1992 ko kihoto holon banaam jachillahu or anya ke maamle (kihoto Hollohan vs Zachillhu And Others) main supreme court ke faisle se hasil he
 Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for the speaker during the Supreme Court hearing on the Karnataka crisis, also referred to the case
 is faisle ke para 111 main spikar ke adhikaron kaa zikr kiya gaya he
 During that time, a bench of five judges gave this decision
 kya kahata he dal-badal kanoonkarnataka maamle ko lekar dal-badal kanoon par sabaki najar he
 This law says that if elected members leave their party under special circumstances, it means the cancellation of their membership
 bhartiya samvidhan kii 10veen anusuchee ko dal-badal virdohi kanoon kaha jaataa he
 It was incorporated into the Constitution in 1985 with the 52nd Amendment
 is kanoon kii jarurat tab mahasoos hui jab siyaasi phaayde ke liye lagaataar sadasyon ko bagaiyr soche samajhe dal kii adla badali karte hue dekha jane laga
 Opportunity and political instability had increased enormously and this mandate was being ignored
 is kanoon ke mutabik koi sadsy sadan main party vip ke khilaaf jaakar voting kare yaa yadi koi sadsy swechha se tyaagptr de athwa koi nirdaleey, chunaav ke baad kisi dal main chalaa jaae yaa yadi manonith sadsy koi dal jwoin kar le to uski sadsyta radd ho jaaegi
 Even after the enactment of the law in 1985, when the interchange did not stop, it was amended
 varsh 2003 main yah tay kiya gaya ki sirf ek vyakti hi nahin, balki yadi samuhik rup se bhi party badali jaati he to use asanvaidhanik qaraar diya jayega
 In the same amendment, Section 3 was also abolished under which a party could be changed with one third party members
 ab aisa kuch karne ke liye do tihaai sadasyon kii rajamandi kii jarurat hogi
 The same important provision also applies to the current state of Karnataka, which prevents less than two-thirds of the mlas from any party in the House from breaking
 party ke sadasyon ko todaa na ja sake isliye unhen ek saath rakhane ke liye shahar ke baahar kisi resort main rakhaa jaataa he
 However, the Election Commission wants clarity in its role regarding this law
 bich main yah maang bhi uthi he ki aise halaat main spikar yaa adhyaksh kii raay kii samiksha bhi thik se kii jaani chahie
 Moreover, the meaning of voluntarily leaving the party should also be properly explained
 kyonki is kanoon kaa istemaal sadsy ko apni baat rakhane se rokane or party hi sarvocch he ki bhaavana ko sahi tehraane ke makasad se bhi kiya ja saktaa he

 And as it happens
 in chaaron ke naam patiala house court se blike warrant jari kar diya jayega
 Black warrant is the last step of death
 kya hota he blike warrant?blike warrant jari hote hi aaazaad hindustan main faansee paane vaale ye 58wein
 The 59th, 60th and 61st will be the culprits
 desh main pehali faansee mahatma gandhi ke hatyare nathuram godse ko hui thi jabaki aakhri yani 57veen faansee 2015 main yaqub memon ko di gai thi
 Afzal Guru last hanged in Tihar! Then the countdown of these four deaths has started
 maut kii khabar ab kabhi bhi aa sakati he
 And this news will come out of Tihar Jail
 jahaan mukesh, vinay or akshya pichley saat saalon se band hai
 Whereas Pawan, who was till now in Mandoli Jail, has also been sent from Mandoli Jail to Tihar
 kyonki mondoli jail main faansee dene kaa intjaam nahin he
 Hanging Kothi is in a secluded place Tihar Jail started to be built in 1945
 13 saal baad 1958 main tihaad ban kar taiyaar hua
 And the prisoners started coming there
 angrejon ke jamaane main hi tihaad ke nakshe main faansee ghar kaa bhi nakshaa banaaya gaya tha
 The hanging house was built according to the same map
 jise ab faansee kothi kehete hai
 This hanging is in a secluded secluded place in Kothi Tihar's jail number three, not far from the prisoners' barracks
 kya he faansee kothi, deth selgel number teen main jis building main faansee kothi he, usee building main kul 16 deth cell hai
 Death cell is the place where only those prisoners who are sentenced to death are kept
 deth cell main kaidi ko akelaa rakhaa jaataa he
 He is taken out for a walk for half an hour in 24 hours
 deth cell kii paharedaari tamilnadu special police karti he
 In a two-hour shift, they only work to keep an eye on the prisoners sentenced to death
 taaki wo khudakushi karne kii koshish naa kare
 That is why prisoners of the death cell are not allowed to wear pajamas even if they leave anything else
 deth cell main akele hote hai kaidiblike warrant par dastakhat hone ke baad faansee kii taarikh or vakt jail prashasan ke suzav or taiyaari ko dekh kar adaalat tay karti he
 After this, the first task is to find the executioner for hanging and the second task is to arrange the rope of the noose
 haalanki desh main pichhali teen faansee jo kasaab, afjal guru or yaqub memon ko di gai wo teenon faansee bagaiyr peshewar jallaad ke di gai
 In all three cases, it was the policeman who took the liver
 faansee ke liye manila ropafaansee kaa fanda kisi aam rassi kaa nahin banaaya jaataa
 Rather, it is a special rope
 jise manila rope kehete hai
 This rope is prepared only for hanging in the Buxar Jail of Bihar in the country
 afjal guru kii faansee ke liye baxur se manila rope mangavaya gai thi
 The price of which was 860 rupees
 haalanki rassi se zyada paise to kiraye main hi kharch ho gaye the
 After the trial of Afzal Guru was broken 2 times, after reaching Manila rope jail once, the trial is now done by the same rope
 trial yani faansee dene se pehle faansee kii practice
 For this, the length of the person to be hanged, the weight of the neck, all are taken
 phir thik usee sies or vajan ke sand bag ko fande par jhulaayaa jaataa he
 This is the reason that the record of the person who has to be hanged, his weight and length is updated daily
 afjal guru kii faansee ke pehle trial ke dauraan do baar rassi tut gai thi
 In such a way, the length of the rope for hanging rope is also fixed according to the weight of the prisoners
 darasal, jis takhte par faansee di jaati he
 The bottom of the well is 15 feet under that plan
 taaki jameen or jhulate pair ke bich puraa faasla ho
 If the weight of the hanging man is 45 kg or less, then the length of the rope is kept longer to hang in the well below the planks
 jo kareeb aath feet hoti he
 While the weight of the hanger is 90 kg or more, the length of the rope is kept short to swing in the well
 kareeb chah feet
 This is because the weight causes more pressure on the rope
 rassi kii lambaai kii naap sir se nahin balki baayen kaan ke neeche jabade se lee jaati he
 Because the loop of hanging starts from there
 nirbhaya ke gunahagaaron ko ek saath faansee!tihaad ke jail number teen main jo faansee kothi he us faansee kothi main pehali or aakhri baar ek saath do logon ko faansee ab se 37 saal pehle 31 janvari 1982 ko ranga-billaa ko di gai thi
 Four people were never hanged together in Tihar
 magar nirbhaya ke gunahagaaron kii taadaad chaar he
 However, four people have been hanged together earlier in the country
 par wo pune kii yadvada jail main hui thi
 On 27 November 1983
 joshi abhyankar cese ke naam se mashhoor das logon kaa katl karne vaale chaar logon ko tab ek saath faansee di gai thi
 So can the four criminals of Nirbhaya also be hanged together in Tihar? It can also be given by two or two
 The length of the planks of the hanging kothi in hanging gallows is about ten feet
 yani itani jagah kaaphi he
 On top of which four people can be raised simultaneously
 bas iske liye takhte ke upar lohe ke rod par chaar faansee ke fande kasne honge
 There are also iron rods under the planks
 jisase takhta khulata or band hota he
 The connection of this rod is to the liver on the side of the board
 liver khinchate hi neeche kaa rod hat jaataa he or takht ke donon sire neeche kii taraf khul jate hai
 Due to which the feet of the person standing on the throne swing down in the well
 deth cell main aakhri palfaansee se ek yaa do din pehle faansee die jane vaale shaks ko deth cell se nikaal kar duusare cell main daal diya jaataa he
 Since the hanging kothi is close to the death cell
 aise main faansee kii taiyaari ko lekar kya kuch chal rahaa he
 How is the trial taking place? ye sab wo dekh naa sake isliye aisa kiya jaataa he
 If a person who dies before a will and last meeting wants to make a will, then the District Magistrate is summoned to jail and his will is written in front of him
 isi tarah aakhri baar jis rishtedaar se bhi wo milanaa chaahe usase bhi use milwaaya jaataa he
 Chai is asked to be hanged in the morning before hanging
 us subah kareeb chaar baje hi faansee par chadhane vaale ko uthaa diya jaataa he
 He is asked to bathe and wear new clothes
 kai baar kaidi nahaane yaa nae kapade pahanane se manaa kar detaa he
 Just as ranga-billa did
 maut kii subah kaidi ko sirf chaay ke liye poocha jaataa he
 The journey from the cell to the hanging frame is followed by the time the prisoner is taken out of his cell according to the time written on the black warrant
 uske ird-gird 12 hathiyaarband guard hote hai
 Many times, the prisoner is carried away from the shoulder because his feet are trembling due to fear of death
 kaidi ko cell se faansee ke takhte tak uskaa cheharaa dhak kar le jaaya jaataa he
 So that what is going on around him cannot be seen
 magistrate kii maujuudagi main hoti he faansifaansee ghar main kitne log rahenge
 For this too, it is clearly written in the prison manual
 ek doctor jo deth certificate par dastakhat karata he
 a Sub Divisional Magistrate
 jinaki nigaraanee main faansee kii puri prakriya hoti he
 Jailor and Deputy Superintendent Jailor
 iske alaava 10 consteble or do head consteble yaa phir itane hi hathiyaarband guard vahaan maujuud rahete hai
 At the time of hanging, whose jail staff or executioners usually do not talk among themselves after reaching Rofansi Kothi
 sab khamosh rahete hai
 All further action is done in gestures
 jailer blike warrant ke hisaab se tay vakt hote hi roomaal neeche kii taraf gira kar ishaara karata he
 The hangman holding the liver pulls the liver
 liver khinchne ke aadhe ghante baad pehali baar doctor marane vaale kii dhadakanen or nabj tatolta he
 If the fire stopped and the pulse stopped, then the corpse was taken down by hanging at the behest of the doctor
 faansee ke prakiya ke dauraan jail main nahin hota koi kamqaidi jitna baari hota he, faansee ke dauraan uski gardan bhi utani hi zyaada khinchati he
 The jailer or executioner always asks for the death of the prisoner during the execution of the neck
 kyonki isse maut kam takalifdeh or kam vakt main hoti he
 During the entire execution of the execution, every work is stopped inside the entire jail until the hanging reaches its end and the corpse is taken down
 har kaidi apane cell apane barrack main hota he
 There is no movement in jail
 ye jail minial kaa hissaa he
 But as soon as the process of hanging ends, the prison life starts again

 Second Intifada (rebellion)? Jammu and Kashmir Finance Minister and the ruling PDP ideologue Haseeb Drabu believes that it would be a simplification to compare the current situation to other occasions in the recent past that have impacted the state
 masalan, 2008 main shri amarnathji tirthaboard ko rajyapal dwaara jameen ke sthanantaran ke sawaal par rajya main andolan hua tha, jo 60 dinon tak chalaa or jisamen 38 log maare gaye
 In 2010, there was resentment over the alleged fake encounter by the army in Machil sector of Kupwara in 2010, in which three youths were killed as 'pakistani intruders', after which a protesting student named Tufail Mattoo was killed in police firing
 
 us baar ghati teen maheene tak sulagati rahi thi or 120 logon kii jaan gai thi
 Political commentator Prem Shankar Jha names the current demonstrations as the 'second intifada'
 drabu isaki tulana 1989-90 ke andolan se karnaa thik nahin samajhate, jise kai log 'pehali intifada' kehete hai
 There were multiple reasons behind the movement of that time - the rise of jihad in Afghanistan, the warring mindset of Pakistan, the weak government at the center and the mistrust of the people in the state government - due to which the valley went out of control
 isi andolan ke baad vivaadaaspad sashastr bal visheshadhikaar adhinium (afsapa) ko 1990 main ghati main lagu kiya gaya, jisane surakshabalon ko kisi bhi janaubhaar ko kuchalane ke abaadh adhikaar de die
 After this, the solidarity of the separatist movement emerged in the form of the All Party Hurriyat Conference, which Pakistan later used as its shadow
 drabu maanate hai ki nabbe ke dashak main jo hua tha vah ''jaateeyata or rashtriyata'' kaa andolan tha, jabaki maujuuda ubhaar kaa strot nihaayat alahada he

 When you campaign the election blaming the BJP and say that the RSS is a dangerous organization, then suddenly you start justifying your alliance with it by making high promises, even when those promises are not fulfilled

 "the conclusion of the political upheaval" is a bit harsh
 mahabuuba mufti ko mukhyamantri bane mahaj teen maheene hue the ki vaani kii maut ke baad sara sankat shuru hua
 She still could not overcome the grief of the death of her father Mufti Mohammed Sayeed that she would have been able to get hold of the administration
 mahabuuba ne 2014 ke assembly chunaavon main khandit janadesh aane ke baad bijepi ke saath gathbandhan par apni aapatti jaahir kii thi
 The PDP won most of the seats in the Valley, while the BJP was heavy in Jammu
 mukrati ne mahabuuba ko or party ke kader ko is baat ke liye raji kiya ki bijepi ke saath gathjod aprihaary he
 Saeed, who had earlier been the Chief Minister of the state, saw his role as a bridge between Jammu and Kashmir, the state and the center, India and Pakistan

 When Saeed was sworn in as Chief Minister on 1 March 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also attended the event
 manch par donon kaa garmjoshi se gale milanaa is baat kaa pratik tha ki donon dalon ne aapas main kitni duuri tay kar lee thi
 Pakistan was initially happy over the fractured mandate but this development made her visibly uncomfortable
 hurriyat ke haashiye par chalate jane or pidipi ke naram algaavvaad ko apnaane kii prakriya main mufti ko islamabad ne bade karine se posa tha
 Pakistan viewed the PDP as a party that could assert autonomy and resist Delhi's 'assimilation intrigues'
 bijepi-pidipi ke gathjod ne uske is sapane ko tod diya
 After this, Pakistan immediately started working towards breaking this alliance
 aisa lagata he ki usne jo yojana banaai thi, vah samay se pehle or kaaphi aasaani se kargar ho gai
 It did not take long for the crisis to occur
 shapath grahan ke baad ek raily main mufti ne pakistan or algaavvaadiyon kaa is baat ke liye shukriya adaa kiya ki unhone chunaav main avrodh paidaa nahin kiya
 This statement was taken to the national media, due to which the ruling coalition started to crumble
 drabu bataate hai ki mufti ko sandarbh se katkar udghrut kiya gaya tha kyonki unhone aage yah bhi kaha tha ki ''pakistan main aakhirkaar loktantr ke phaaydon or mulyon kii samaj paidaa ho gai he
 The BJP is also blamed for reacting excessively to Saeed for every decision or every step taken
 unhone jab 2010 ke pradarshnon main giraftaar masarrat alam kii rihaai kaa elaan kiya to unhen is faisle ko palatney par majaboor kiya gaya
 Amitabh Mattoo, an eminent academic and mentor of the Mufti, points out that the Marhoom leader always felt that all parties like the Hurriyat and Pakistan would provide security and stability
 drabu bataate hai ki mufti ko jab pataa chalaa ki pidipi ke chunavi ghoshnaptr main hurriyat kaa naam lekar uskaa zikr nahin kiya gaya tha to unhone jor dekar kaha ki use jari karne se pehle ve chhapi hui pratiyon par khud haath se uskaa naam likh denge
 Even talks with the Hurriyat were clearly placed on the agenda of an alliance with the BJP
 iske baavjood modi sarkaar ne hurriyat ke khilaaf kathorta barti—or yahaan tak ki pakistan ke saath aadhikarik vaarta ko bhi radd kar daalaa kyonki vahaan ke mantri hurriyat se milanaa chaahate the—isliye vishwaas bahaali kii prakriya ko sahaj karne kii said kii koshishon ko gambhir jhatka laga
 The real issue, as Mattu understands, was that the Muftis considered "governance and development to be the focal point of alliances" and perceived that alliances with the BJP would give them the necessary funds from the Center
 hua yah ki unke shuruaati maheene andruni uthapatak main hi biit gaye or sara vakt siyasat, aarthiki or vikaas ke bich ulajhakar rah gaya
 After the Center promised the amount of flood relief, they were deeply disappointed in the manner in which it was released
 srinagar main ai vinaashak baadh ke baad modi ne rajya ko 44,000 karod ru
 Which the state had sought for relief and rehabilitation
 drabu bataate hai ki mufti lagaataar yah poochhate rahe ki paisa labhaarthiyon tak pahunchaa yaa nahin
 Look at the irony that on the very day he died, the Center transferred the money, but by then he was gone
 takhtapalat kii kavaydamufti kii maut se mahabuuba bikhar gai thim
 He was also disenchanted with the way the coalition worked
 unhone kaha ki 40 din kii gami khatm hone se pehle ve netritv ke uttaradhikaar par koi bhi charchaa nahin karengi
 She raised the party from the ground level, which is why she was more interested in taking charge of the party and left the task of governance to her father
 jammu-kashmir main sarkarein chah saal ke liye chuni jaati hai, isliye party ke sadasyon ko bhi ummid thi ki is avadhi ke aadha biit jane par hi kaman unke haath main aegi, lekin niyati ko kuch or hi manjuur tha
 Before taking command, Mehbooba took assurance from the BJP that she would honor some specific promises made in the coalition government's agenda
 inamen us bhoomi kaa hastantaran bhi shaamil tha, jiskaa patta raksha mantralay ne liya tha lekin jo khaali padi thi
 This included transfer of two power plants operated by NHPC to the state government, encouraging engagement with the Hurriyat and Pakistan and taking cognizance of the withdrawal of the Akraspa
 bijepi kii rajya ikai in maangon se bahut khush nahin thi or kai daur kii vaarta gatirodh ko todgaye main naakaam rahi
 During this period, some members of the PDP made an alternative plan to break away from the party and form another front, which could form an alliance with the BJP

 She reached Srinagar in a fit of annoyance and was determined to break the alliance

 un par yah bhi aarope lage ki unhone varisht police afasaron kaa bina kisi kaaran ke tabadalaa kar diya or unki jagah apane pasandida sthaneey muslim afasaron ko tainaat kiya
 During this time relations between India and Pakistan had also started deteriorating
 pidipi-bijepi gathbandhan ko sankatagrast dekhte hue pakistan ne kashmir main baithe apane tatwon ko sakriy karnaa shuru kiya
 As the ice melted, cross-border infiltration on the loc began to increase
 bhartiya fouj kii report he ki may ke baad se ghuspaith main doguni vruddhi hui
 There are also reports that Pakistani supporters sitting in the valley from Islamabad started receiving money directly
 thik isi vakt hurriyat ne mahabuuba sarkaar ke khilaaf apana prachaar abhiyaan tej kar diya
 Soon after Mehbooba took over the chair, she raised the issue of establishing Pandits and military colonies, which was proposed by the government
 pandit coloniyon kaa uddeshy un kashmiri hinduon ko punervasit karnaa tha, jo 1989-91 ke andolan main beghar ho gaye the
 The purpose of military colonies was to resettle the state's retired armed forces personnel
 algaavvaadiyon ne in coloniyon kii tulana israeli bastiyon se kar daali or hurriyat ke adhyaksh saiyad ali shah gilaani ne chetavanee di ki ''logon ko un sajishon kii mukhaalafat karne ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie, jinka makasad kashmir kii aabaadi kii shakl ko badalanaa he
 Mehbooba hanged the plan under pressure
 unhone mufti kii nai audyogic niti ko bhi thande baste main daal diya, jiske tahat rajya se baahar ke udyogpatiyon ko lambii avadhi ke liye jameen patte par dene kaa prastaav kiya gaya tha
 Significantly, in Jammu and Kashmir, people who are outside the state, whether by birth or descent, are prohibited from taking land
 said kii is niti ko algaavvaadiyon ne rajya ke baahar se logon ko badi sankhya main laakar yahaan aabaadi kii sanrachana main badlaav karne kii koshish qaraar diya tha
 These demonstrations frustrated the industrialists, who were worried about the security situation here anyway
 june aate-aate surakshabalon ne rajya or centre donon kii sarkaron ko chetanaa shuru kar diya tha ki ghati main sataha ke neeche asantosh khadbada rahaa he or kabhi bhi ubaal maar saktaa he
 Lieutenant General Satish Kumar Dua, the GOC (general Officer Commanding) of the 15th Corps of the Army, which oversees the valley, says his troops were constantly reporting a new trend that when an operation was conducted to capture a terrorist, the locals Used to gather in large numbers and broke the security cordon and attacked the security forces
 unke mutabik, aise main kadi chetavanee jari kii jaati thi ki agar koi oparation ko baadhit karne kii koshish karegaa to sena uske khilaaf 'upyukt karrwai' karne ko majaboor ho jaaegi
 He said that dissatisfaction had arisen long before Burhan Wani's death
 vaani kii moutsuraksha sutron kaa kahana he ki vaani kii muthbhed main hui maut suniyojit nahin thi
 The security force was behind another militant Sartaj Sheikh and he had no idea that Wani was also present at that hideout
 jab unhone thikaane par hamalaa kiya or teen aatankiyon ko maar giraaya, tab unhone pahachaanaa ki unamem ek vaani bhi tha
 After this, Wani's picture was sent from whatsapp to Srinagar to confirm it
 surakshabal vaani ko hameshaa halke main lete the kyonki ve use soshal media kaa vir maanate the, asli khatra nahin
 Although he was the commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen, he did not go out for training and was considered raw and Shoshabaj
 rajya or kendriya surakshabalon ko ummid nahin thi ki vaani kii maut kii aisi pratikriya hogi
 In his hometown of Tral, he was amazed at the crowd that gathered in his funeral — some newspapers reported that more than two million people had attended it
 is dauraan pidipi or anya dalon ne aarope-pratyarope kaa khel shuru kar diya ki vaani ko muthbhed main maaraa gaya yaa pakadaaey ke baad uski hatya kii gai
 This greatly discouraged the security forces, who till now considered their work to be excellent

 They had no idea of the type of protests, the spread and its traces

 Instead of big cities, the crowd started attacking at taluka level and in small occupations

 Meanwhile, many protesters were seen in the eyes

 He sent Rajnath Singh to the valley so that he could hold Mehbooba's hand and provide him all kinds of help
 iske alaava modi ne kashmir par charchaa ke liye sarvadaleey baithak bulaai or sankat ko thaamne ke liye ekajute karrwai kaa faisla liya
 Rajnath Singh proved to be the ideal in pacifying Mehbooba's restlessness
 prabhavit ilaakon kaa daura karne ke liye unhone helicopter ke istemaal se inkaar kar diya or un jagahon par car se gaye taaki yah dikhaaya ja sake ki unhen surakshabalon kii kshamta par puraa bharosa he
 He addressed a joint press conference at Mehbooba's residence, bypassing the protocol (it was tried to put it in someone else's residence near the Chief Minister's residence but when it came to know that the place is Hari Niwas, which has been around for a long time It is lying empty and the local belief about it is that if the person living in it gets cursed to suffer, then this idea was abandoned)
 mahabuuba ne jab achaanak press conference ko samaapt kar diya, tab bhi rajnath ne apana sanyam nahin khoyaa or ve rajya tathaa centre ke bich bharosa kaayam karne kii vaastavik koshish karte hue dekhe gaye
 Mehbooba's attitude was changed radically after her dialogue with Rajnath and Modi
 unka aatmavishvaas laut aayaa tha
 He expressed his indignation at the separatists who left their children to die and attacked Pakistan for instigating them
 is dauraan umr abdulla sarvadaleey pratinidhimandal kii aguai karte hue modi ke paas pahunche or unhone kaha, ''pradhanmantri kaaphi aashwast the or unhone kaam chalau tareeke kii jagah ek sthaayee samaadhaan kii baat kahi he
 On the other hand, with the imposition of security forces curfew in the valley and increasing the number of BSF and other central forces, the situation started to calm down
 iske baavjood adhiktar ilaakon se karfu hataane main kul 50 din lag gaye or ab bhi chhitput pradarshan jari hai
 What should be done: In the coming months, the state and the center will have to focus themselves on three important priorities
 pehali cheez, niyam-kanoon ko teji se behaal karnaa or halaat saamaanya karnaa he
 Second, the job is to address governance and development, so that services can continue uninterrupted and people can employ in a healthy way
 teesraa or shaayad sabase mushkil kaam, sabhi pakshakaron ke saath samvaad kaa rasta kholana he, taaki mil-julkar is chah dashak puraane vivaad kaa 'sthaayee' or 'tikaoo' samaadhaan khoja ja sake
 In the case of law and order, it is necessary to re-establish confidence in the security forces
 unhen bheed ko niyantrit karne or apane ilaake par kabja lene ke kaam ko karne kii puri chhot di jaae
 As a senior police officer points out, security forces will have to carry out a 'salute slice' operation to maintain order in the interiors
 vyavasthit tareeke se un gaanvon par kabja karnaa hoga, jo kathith rup se aatankiyon ke kabje main hai
 For this, it is necessary that the terrorists are captured and detained
 is kram main balon ko satark rahete hue bheed ko jutane se rokna hoga
 Rapid deployment will have to be made on the vacant police posts and the destroyed posts will have to be rebuilt
 saamaanya halaat lautne ke liye sarkaar ko dobaaraa kaam shuru karnaa chahie, skool khole jane chahie or vyapaariyon ko kaarobaar karne ko protsaahit kiya janaa chahie
 Elder police officers are assuming that violent incidents will continue for a few months to come, but they hope that once the fruit picking season starts in mid-september, people will start focusing on their work rather than fuss

 The program of skill development is also important for the youth, which should be emphasized
 rahamaan kehete hai, ''kashmiri noujvaan khud ko haara hua mahasoos karata he ki use avasar nahin die gaye
 There are 2 million students in the schools and we have to start a process of engagement with them that leaves them looking through safety glasses
 '' kashmir main yuvaaon ko saath laana jaruri he kyonki asal takaraav ke centre main yahi peedi he jo banduukon or mauton ke saaye main pali-badi he
 His image is contradictory — it is characterized by military supremacy, the recent rise of the BJP is reflected in it, as well as the hordes of cow vigilantes and Bharat Mata ki Jai, and the ever-thriving middle-class Indians
 baaki desh main yuvaaon ko kendriya wajife dekar prashikshit karne kii kuch koshishen avashya hui hai, lekin ve paryaapt nahin hai

 Since independence, Kashmir has been defining the relationship between India and Pakistan and the two countries have fought three wars on this issue - adding the Bangladesh chapter of 1971, there is a total of four wars
 pakistan ne 1947 main kashmir ke bharat main vilay se yah kehete hue inkaar kar diya tha ki vah muslim bahul rajya he, jis par uskaa haq banataa he

 In the latter part of the eighties, when Pakistan came with nuclear weapons, it changed its tactics and waged an unannounced and unilateral war against India, in which it started supporting militancy and terrorist attacks

 The central government has approved giving ownership to people living in illegal colonies
 dilli sarkaar ke mutabik dilli main kul 1797 anadhikrut coloniyaan hai
 People living in all these colonies will get the benefit of this initiative
 itnaa hi nahin jameen se jude mukademe bhi khatm honge
 The Lieutenant Governor of Delhi has approved the proposal to end the land dispute in the villages
 varshon se dilli kii in avaidh coloniyon main rahane vaale logon kii ummid puri hone vaali hai or in coloniyon main kaaphi kuch badal jayega-nijee ho yaa sarkari jameen milegaa malikana haq1797 anadhikrut coloniyon main rah rahe lakhon logon ko hameshaa apana ashiana ujadane kii chintaa sataati rahati thi
 But now this will not happen
 ab baqayda unke sampatti kii registry hogi
 His property will get legal recognition
 sabase khaas baat he ki yadi koi colony sarkari jameen par basii he use bhi malikana haq milegaa
 Whether the plot is on private land or a colony settled on government land, the house will get legal recognition
 maamuli rate par hogi registry, kharid - farokht ko kanoonee darjivaidh coloniyon main ab kharid-farokht ko kanoonee darja milegaa or property kii ab registry hogi
 Some exemptions may also be given by the government for registration of plot or building
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki sarkaar iske liye zyada shulk nahin lagaaegi
 It is being considered by the government that the fee of the chemistry should be reduced so that people can easily register
 bataaya ja rahaa he registry shulk ko do kishton main bharne kii bhi chhot di ja sakati he
 Roads, parks, sewer lines, such as development people, have been living in these colonies since long, but nothing in the name of facilities
 coloniyaan vaid hone ke baad ab yahaan sadak, park, siver line kii suvidha milegi
 The most problem was due to lack of sewer line
 coloniyaan paas hone ke baad siver line bichaai jaaegi, park kii suvidha hogi saath hi vikaas ke kai kaary bhi shuru honge
 People living in loan colonies would not be able to get a loan till now
 yadi koi in coloniyon main flats bhi kharidne jaataa tha to use kisi bhi bank kii ore se lone nahin pradaan kiya jaataa tha
 If someone had to buy a property, then he has to pay the entire amount in one go
 in coloniyon main rahane vaale kisi shaks ko musiibat ke vakt yaa kisi jaruri kaary ke liye lone kii jarurat hoti thi to vah chaahakar bhi apni property par lone nahin le saktaa tha
 Now both these problems will be solved easily
 GPA chen ke khone or chori hone kaa nahin hoga daub tak in coloniyon main kharid-farokht general power of atorni (gpa)ke jariye hota tha
 The biggest problem is keeping the GPA paper
 koun, kab, kisko, praparty bechaa yaa kharida isaki ek puri chen hoti he
 Which had to be kept safely
 yadi galati se bhi is chen koi paper chhot gaya yaa chori ho gaya to uske saamne badi dikkat paidaa ho jaati thi
 The biggest proof for this property is yours
 registry shuru ho jane ke baad is jhanjhat se bhi chhutkaaraa mil jayega
 There will be facility of community center, health clinics, after the colonies become regularized, many facilities will be provided here, which was not available till now
 in coloniyon ke aas- paas community centre banegaa saath hi health clinics bhi shuru hoga
 For any small ceremony to be held, the procession house etc
 will also be constructed

 Every village in the district and every house in the village is round the clock

 Khargone district is 175 kilometers away from Indore city of Madhya Pradesh, which is happening every day
 jise navagraha kii nagari ke taur par bhi janaa jaataa he
 For the past six months, at least two people have been committing suicide in this district every day
 na to wo kisaan hai or naa hi sookhe kii maar se pareshaan

 jivan kii laash khud unke ghar ke saamne ek ped se lataki mili
 However, there is neither a reason for suicide nor one of the ways
 yahi vajah he ki ye gaanv ab logon ke liye ek paheli ban chukaa he
 The awareness campaign being run by the administration is now the condition that the district administration as well as social organizations have also come forward and started the process of persuading people

 He liked to add broken bones

 When the door was late, the police forcibly entered
 police ghar main daakhil ho to gai thi
 But the scene that was in front of his eyes was about to make the color stand up

 sawaal uthta he ki manmohan kii kursi par phir koun baithegaa?manmohan singh ab maayoos dikhte hai, lekin videsh main hone par ve aise nahin dikhte
 Recall that moment of 2009, when he got very close to public laughter
 unki vaahvahee ke dinon main uttaradhikari par koi bahes nahin thi, haalanki ise lekar anischitata barkaraar thi ki yah bahes kab shuru ho jaaegi
 In his first press conference, he offered Rahul Gandhi his chair as soon as he left
 rahul gandhi ko maaloom hona chahie tha ki insaan kii jindagi main maukey baar-baar nahin milte
 You can also say that time and fever do not wait for a person
 uttar pradesh chunaav kaa vakt nikal gaya
 But since compromise with hierarchy is not possible within the Congress, whatever will come on Manmohan's chair will be interim
 qatari main khadey pratyaashiyon ko isse dikkat nahin he
 Most of them will permeate by becoming Prime Minister of one day only
 samasya yah he ki qatari bhari hui he
 Pranab Mukherjee is at the forefront, but what will the Prime Minister do when Sonia cannot make him President
 e
 K
 antni raahat de sakate hai, lekin hawaaon kaa rukh modane kii takat unamem nahin he
 P
 chidambaram ke bare main sochaa ja saktaa he, lekin unki pratishtha dol rahi he or unhen sajaa dene ke mood main baithe is desh ke logon main isse sahi sandesh nahin jayega
 If Sonia Gandhi does not disturb the cabinet, then she is left with the choice of Rajya Sabha Chairman and Speaker of Lok Sabha, Hamid Ansari and Meera Kumar
 donon yogya hai, lekin inaki apni-apni dikkatein hai
 Will they accept all coalition partners? Especially when they know that the Congress has to appoint its President? The current UPA has 4,60,000 votes in an electorate of 11,50,000
 lihaaja use gathbandhan ke baahar ek yaa do sahyogiyon kii jarurat padegi
 Mulayam Singh Yadav may hold the key
 unhone sanket bhi diya he ki unke dimag main ek or muslim pratyaashee he
 Sonia will have to stamp her candidate to seek his support
 duusari taraf mira kumaar par mayawati raji nahin hongi
 How easy was this task five years ago
 bhale congress ke us vakt kam saansad the, lekin behatar netritv or jan samarthan kii vajah se ek anjaan pratibha patil kii naiya paar lag gai
 It should not be that the Congress, completely exhausted after doing all the cutting and pruning, should stop going in the name of Pratibha Patil, who is certainly the least controversial
 unki pratishtha dhundhala chuki he, lekin us samskruti main jahaan netaa apane biodata main jail main rahane kii avadhi bhi darj karte hai, vahaan unhen nirdosh maanane main kya dikkat he or unki to sabase badi yogyata ab bhi yahi he ki ve sonia kii sabase badi vafaadaar hai
 One of the biggest political traits with Pratibha Patil is Nathi: status quo
 koi bhi anya naam us dhaanche ko hi khiskaa degaa jisaki neenv pehle se daraki hui he
 It may be that Sonia proposes her name in front of the opposition
 2007 main shivasena ne kshetreey kaarnon se patil kaa samarthan kiya tha
 It may be that Sonia lures the BJP to the post of Vice President
 dekhie, kaise achaanak sonia gandhi ke dimag main ek apratyaashit ummidavaar aa hi gaya, jo girte-padate shaayad ab tak chal rahe duusare naamon ko peeche chhod de
 Many vicious criminals have been caught in the country, whose misdeeds can shock any common man
 use khaufjada kar sakati hai
 Some of them are merciless murderers, some infamous marauders or rapists
 rajasthan police ne ek aise hi darinde ko giraftaar kiya he, jiske kaale karnaamein jaanakar pulisavaale bhi dang rah gaye
 The victim was arrested on charges of raping an innocent
 lekin jab uski sachai poochtacha main saamne ai to police ko pataa chalaa ki us shaks ne jurm kii ek nai ibaarat likh di he
 When you hear these words, you imagine a man who has made women fall prey to their lust
 lekin ham jis shaks kii karatuut aapke saamne rakhane vaale hai
 For him, this word also seems small
 wo ek aisa darinda he, jisane maasoom bacchiyon, bacchon ke alaava purushon or kinnaron ko bhi apni havas kaa shikaar bana daalaa
 He was so obsessed that he did not leave anyone
 uske gunaah kii fehrist itani lambii he ki police ko poochtacha main kai ghanton kaa vakt laga
 In this way, in Rajasthan's capital Jaipur, the police arrested a man for raping a seven-year-old innocent
 jisaki pahchaan sikandar urf jeevanu ke rup main hui
 The police had no idea that the darinda who came in his grip is actually a serial rapist
 jisane haivaaniyat kii sari hadein paar kar di
 The police caught him and brought him to the police station and questioned him
 poochtacha main hua khaufnak khulaasiske baad jeevanu ne khud apane gunahon kaa chiththa police ke saamne khol kar rakh diya
 The policemen were surprised that the person who came to their hand is a notorious criminal who did not one or two, but carried out more than 65 rape cases
 beete shanivaar ko sikandar urf jeevanu ne police ko poochtacha main kaha ki wo jab bhi jail se chhutegaa, to police ko uski khabar dene vaale ko maut degaa
 Alexander, aka Jeevika, committed his crimes one by one
 usne police ko bataaya ki shastri nagar main usne naaballig bacchee ke saath balaatkaar kiya tha
 He wanted to kill the girl
 poochtacha ke dauraan jeevanu ne kota main apane dost kii naaballig bacchee ko bhi shikaar banaaya tha, lekin uski hatya nahin karne ko wo apni sabase badi bhul bataa rahaa he
 According to the police, the bacteria have so far made more than 25 minor boys a victim of their lust
 yahi nahin us serial repist jeevanu ne 40 purushon or kinnaron kaa bhi aprakritik yon shoshan kiya
 He sexually abused men younger than women
 jeevanu or keetanu kii jodisikandar urf jeevanu ke kai naam hai
 He is known by different names
 usne apane ek saathi ke saath milakar lut or chori kii vaardaaton ko bhi anjaam diya
 There was competition between the two to commit more thieves in one night
 sikandar ne hi apana naam jeevanu or apane saathi kaa naam keetanu rakhaa tha
 Drug trafficking Police discovered that bacteria also smuggled drugs
 vah maadak padaarthon ko jaipur ke parkota kshetra main supplai karata tha
 He told the police that on July 1, after raping a minor girl in Shastri Nagar, on July 2, he was hiding near a barbershop in Jaipur
 lekin media main sisitivi footage dekhne ke baad vah faraar ho gaya
 After this he went to Sanganer and slept on the pavement with the laborers
 4 july ko aaropee jeevanu tonk kii ore chalaa gaya tha or phir 5 july ko devli ke theke par celsman se jhagada kiya
 There too, he shot manager Sohan Lal and escaped after robbing 20 thousand rupees
 devli main lut ke baad main aaropee jeevanu kota main apane dost ke paas jaakar chhip gaya tha
 The bacterium caught by surveillance, during this time, the police had put his mobile number under surveillance
 police uske mobile number kii lokation ko tres karte hue kota tak ja pahunchi
 At 5 pm on Saturday, Sikandar was drinking tea at Babu Chai Wale's tiger in Bhimganj, Kota, when the police nabbed him
 police poochtacha main usne kubul kiya ki 1 july or 22 june ko jaipur ke shastrinagar ilaake main 7 saal or 4 saal kii bacchee ke saath usee ne rape kiya tha
 In 2015 too, after coming out on bail, he molested two children in Bhatta Basti area, when the police caught him but he escaped after attacking the policemen with a shield
 uske khilaaf ab tak kai maamle darj ho chuke hai
 He has been in jail 6 times
 ab police uske khilaaf majboot cese banane kii taiyaari main hai

 ralospa pramukhupendra kushvaahane ek baranithish kumarasarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Union Minister of State and RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha on Tuesday indirectly targeted Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, alleging that there is no fear of law in the minds of criminals in the state

 pichley dinon unhone 'siyaasi kheer' banane kaa formula diya tha jisamen unhone yaduwanshiyon or kushavanshiyon ke gathjod ke sanket die the
 Upendra, who is said to be angry at the lack of importance in the NDA governed by the Center, said that it seems that fear of law has vanished from the minds of criminals operating in Bihar
 yah prashasan ke samaksh ek chunauti he
 On the other hand, BJP senior BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi stressed that since Nitish left the Grand Alliance, law and order in the state has improved

 Sushil said that along with general crime, the state government has also been successful in curbing the Naxalite incident, which has slipped Bihar to number 5 in the list of Naxalite affected states
 2016 kii 100 or 2017 kii 71 naksali vaardaat ke mukaable is saal ab tak keval 25 ghatnaayen huin hai
 An interesting turn in Bihar politics came in 2017 when Chief Minister Nitish Kumar left Lalu Prasad Yadav and joined the NDA again
 rajya main bijepi is samay nitish kumaar ko bada bhai bhi maanane ke liye raji najar aa rahi he
 But the deepening friendship between Nitish and the BJP is not appealing to Upendra Kushwaha, who became Modi's partner in 2014
 shaayad isiilie kushvaha baagi tevar dikhaa rahe hai
 Upendra Kushwahane, a minister in the 'kheer' Modi government with the RJD, hinted at an alliance with the RJD in gestures at BP Mandal's centenary celebrations in Patna in the last week of last month
 kushvaha ne tab kaha tha, 'yaduwanshi (yadav) kaa doodh or kushavanshi (koiri samaaj) kaa chaaval mil jaae to kheer badhiya hogi or us swaadisht vyanjan ke banane se koi roak nahin saktaa he
 Later he clarified this further and said that this kheer will not be tasty until it will become a panchmeva of small castes and downtrodden society
 yahi saamaajik nyaay kii asli paribhaasha he
 To defeat the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav is trying to bring OBC, Muslim and Dalit votes as well as OBC votes this time
 lekin endie main nitish kii entry ke baad upendra kushvaha ke liye bahut zyada raajnneetik jagah nahin bachi he
 In such a situation, Kushwaha is also looking for a strong political partner

 Indian notes of 2000, 500 and 200 are banned in the neighboring country Nepal
 itnaa hi nahin, in bhartiya noton ko nepal main pakade jane par jail bhi ho sakati hai
 There is no information about why the Government of Nepal took this decision, but its deep impact is being seen on the economy of Nepal which runs on Indian rupees
 bhartiya khariddaar yaa paryatak nepal jane se kataraa rahe hai, kyonki nepal main sirf 100 rupee ke bhartiya note hi maanya hai
 The ideal market of Birgunj in Nepal was formerly full of Indian buyers, but today there are few Indian buyers
 bharat-nepal border par sthit birganj se puure nepal ke halaat kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Only 100 rupee Indian notes are valid in Nepal
 nepal main khariddaari karne jane vaale bhartiya naagarik sau-sau ke zyada note apane saath lekar nahin jate hai
 They carry such notes only to a extent
 birganj main dukaan chalaane vaale brajesh agarwal kaa kahana he ki ham sirf 100 ke note le rahe hai
 Trade is closed due to non-running of Indian currency notes
 jo nepal aa rahe hai, unako niyam to maananaa hi padegaa
 While crossing the border coming from India, change from there and bring 100 rupee notes
 bada note ham log nahin le rahe hai
 Nepal government issues 100 note, hence will take 100 rupee note
 agar koi 2000, 200 or 500 ke note laata he, to vah gaiyrkanoonee he
 These notes have no value here
 nae saal se pehle notebandi se maayoos nepal ke kaarobaariapako bataa den ki bihar main sharabbandi se nepal ke sharaab kaarobaar main baari oochaal aayaa tha
 The liquor traders were quite happy
 unhen ummid thi ki is nae saal ke avasar par nepali sharaab kii khub maang bihar main hogi, lekin notebandi ke is faisle ne unki ummiido par pani pher diya he
 Now a small number of people from Bihar are reaching Nepal to buy liquor
 sharaab ke thok kaarobaari ramdhaar prasad sarraf kehete hai ki bada note band hone par prabhaav to padataa he, jo bhi udhar kaa aadmi saamaan lene ke liye yahaan aata he, wo bada note lekar aata he or ham logon ko idhar dikkat hone lagi he
 Big notes have become illegal here
 iske chakkar main hamaara thodaa vyapaar bhi kam hua he
 In Bihar, our trade was increased by prohibition, but it has been affected by demonetisation
 vyapaar main 25 fisadi tak kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 National President of Nepal Bharat Sahyog Manch, Ashok Kumar Vaidya said, 'government of Nepal has declared the year 2020 as tourism year, which will now have an impact
 nepal sarkaar ne yah kadam kis vajah se uthaaya he, abhi tak mujhe yah samaj main nahin aayaa he
 For this, the government should find an alternative solution, otherwise the general public, especially the middle class and lower class people, will have to face a lot of trouble
 nepal sarkaar ne achaanak bade bhartiya noton par laga diya pratibandhunhone kaha ki nepal sarkaar kii cabinet ne 10 disambar ko achaanak ye faisla liya ki do hajaar, paanch sau or do sau ke bhartiya note ab nepal main nahin chalenge
 Why the government took this decision, it did not tell the public about it
 yahaan tak ki jinke paas ye bhartiya rupee pehle se hai, unhen badalane ke liye bhi koi samay nahin diya
 It was also said that those who would have Indian rupees of two thousand five hundred and two hundred, would be jailed
 sarkaar ke is faisle ke baad bharat se lage border par nepal prahari dwaara saghan checking bhi chalaai gai or jinke paas ye bhartiya rupee paae gaye unhen jail bheja gaya
 The Commercial Association of Nepal is also shocked by this decision of the Government of Industry Commerce Association of Haripanepal
 sarkaar ne yah faisla kyon liya, ye samaj se pare he
 Some believe that one thousand and five hundred currency notes were declared illegal in India during demonetisation, since then a lot of money has been stuck in the cycle of demonetisation in Nepal
 nepal sarkaar baar-baar bharat sarkaar se in noton ko badalane ke liye dabaav bana chuki he, lekin bharat badalane ko taiyaar nahin he
 India says that it has always given hundred hundred notes to Nepal
 nepal main pehle bhi hajaar or paanch sau rupee ke bhartiya note bain the
 In such a situation, they cannot be changed
 udyog vaanijya sangh birganj ke adhyaksh om prakaash sharma kaa kahana he ki pehle bhi nepal sarkaar ne hajaar or paanch sau ke puraane bhartiya note ko bain kiya tha, lekin usamen 25 hajaar rupee tak le jane kii chhot di thi, lekin is baar aisa kuch nahin kiya gaya he, jisaki vajah se nepal kii arthvyavastha ko 90 pratishat tak nuksaan uthaanaa padegaa
 The people of India will suffer only 10 percent loss
 jaahir he kibhartiya notaki nepal main bandi se nepal ko zyada nuksaan ho rahaa hai
 No big Indian currency is being carried by Nepal for fear of law
 aise main vahaan ke kaarobaar par iskaa baari asar dekhne ko mil rahaa hai
 Tourism is a huge source of income in Nepal
 agar bhartiya paryatak nahin jaaenge, to nishchit rup se iskaa asar nepal kii arthvyastha par padegaa

 ' Taking an unprecedented step, the Delhi cabinet today passed a resolution challenging the authority of Lt
 Governor Najeeb Jung to free the value-added tax (VAT) commissioner
 dilli sarkaar kaa kahana he ki waite ayukta ko isliye nishaanaa banaaya gaya kyonki vah 'bhrashtachar' se lard rahe the

 According to the secretariat, on October 9, the Ministry of Home Affairs had issued instructions that the five officers, who were earlier transferred from Delhi to other union territories, should be relieved with immediate effect
 kumaar kaa naam in paanch adhikariyon kii suchi main tha
 On the allegations by the Lt
 Governor of threatening officers, Jung's office said that it would not like to comment on how the elected government of Delhi dealt with other officials, including the Chief Secretary, Home Secretary, Energy Secretary and Law Secretary
 is
 cabinet ne up-rajyapal se chaar sawaal puche hai ki kya yah sach he ki unhone vimukti aadesh paarit karne ke baad kumaar ko bulaayaa or unhen tatkaal dilli se chale jane kii dhamkee di
 It was also asked whether he had received any written or verbal instructions from the PMO or the Ministry of Home Affairs regarding the release of Kumar
 duusare prastaav main cabinet ne ek jioem gathit karne kaa faisla kiya jo adhikariyon ko raajnneetik atyaachaar se bachaayegaa
 The gom will be entitled to take steps to deal with all such issues

 The long-running dialogue between the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party for the Lok Sabha elections seems to be at an end
 gathbandhan ko lekar donon hi partiyon main sahmati nahin ban saki he
 Seeing no alliance, the Congress has now decided to field candidates for all 7 Lok Sabha seats in Delhi

 Delhi Pradesh Congress President Sheila Dikshit said on Saturday that the party could announce candidates on Sunday or after

 The party will decide on this

 com / jat90iuipp— ANI (@ANI) July 3, 2019 Baba Barfani's crazy fans are not taking the name of stop and continue to climb, despite the difficulties faced during the journey
 3 july ko jo shraddhalu ja rahe hai
 
 
 Devotees going from Jammu Baltal - 1635 women - 379 children - 15 Sadhu - 20 Sadhvi - 03 total devotees - 2052 from Pahalgam road - Purush - 2174 women - 412 children - 09 Sadhu - 44 Sadhvi - 03 Total passengers - 2642 Let you know that till Tuesday, 11,456 pilgrims have 'darshan' of Baba Barfani
 Were completed
 mausam vibhaag ne purvanumaan main shaam ke samay baltaal-pavitra gupha, pahalgam-pavitra gupha ke aasapaas halki barish / bauchhaarein padane sambhaavna jataai he, haalanki aisa hona ke asaar kam hai
 This year's Amarnath Yatra started on 1 July and will conclude 45 days later on 15 August with Shravan Purnima
 pavitra gupha kashmir himalay main samudr tal se 3,888 meter kii oonchai par sthit he
 Significantly, the Amarnath Yatra is one of the most difficult journeys, which is very important not only for climbing but also for the issue of security
 kai baar ye yatra aatankiyon ke hamale kaa shikaar hui he, isi vajah se is baar suraksha kaaphi badhaai gai he
 Thousands of security forces, including police, force are deployed on behalf of the central government and the state government
 modi sarkaar par ghar ke andar se hi chautarafa dabaav banataa ja rahaa he ki voram mandirke nirmaan ke liye sadan main kaanoon laae or ayodhya main ramajnmabhumi par mandir nirmaan kaa rasta saaf kare
 The final stamp on this possibility came from the statement of Mohan Bhagwat at Vijayadashami program of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 sangh pramukh ne apane sambodhan main kaha ki ram mandir ke liye kanoon bananaa chahie
 If Bhagwat is saying this, then in a way he is pointing directly to the government that keeping in mind the sentiments of the supporters of the Sangh and BJP and those who have faith in Ram, the Modi government should bring a law for the Ram temple in the House needed
 modi sarkaar par mandir nirmaan ke liye dabaav kam nahin he
 From responding to activists and voters on the ground, showing themselves committed to building the temple is becoming essential for the BJP
 duusari ore santon ne sarkaar ko is mudde par gherna shuru kar diya he ki mandir nirmaan main deree ve bardaasht nahin karenge
 The saints say that the BJP has forgotten its promise to build the temple and why the statement of waiting for the decision of the Supreme Court is being given repeatedly by the party
 dhyaan rahe ki santon ke ek bade varg or ram mandir andolan se jude mahanton ne is varsh 6 disambar se ayodhya main mandir nirmaan kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 The Sant Samaj says that they will start the work of temple construction, if the government wants to stop then stop
 santon kaa yah aahvaan sarkaar ke liye kam chunauteepurn nahin he
 It will be very difficult for the Modi government at the Center and the Yogi government in the state to use any kind of force to stop the saints
 isse bhaajapa ko apane samarthakon ke bich khaasaa nuksaan jhelana pad saktaa he
 This announcement of Sant Samaj has got a kind of legitimacy from today's speech of the Sangh chief
 sangh ne spasht kar diya he ki wo ram mandir ke liye court ke faisle kaa intazaar nahin karnaa chahta or sarkaar iske liye kaanoon laakar mandir nirmaan kaa rasta saaf kare
 Government will bring the bill? In such a situation, there seems to be only one way left for the BJP and that to establish its commitment to Ram temple, Modi government should put the Ram temple bill in the upcoming winter session of the House
 isse bhaajapa ko laabh bhi he
 The first is that the government will be able to establish what their intention is towards the Ram temple just before the election among the people
 wo apane matadaataaon ko bataa sakegi ki kam se kam bhaajapa or modi ayodhya main ramamandir ke nirmaan ke prati patibaddh hai
 Another advantage is that it will not be a comfortable situation for the opposition
 vipaksh isapar tuutegaa
 It will not be easy for the Congress to mix its soft Hindutva efforts with the soil by opposing the proposal on the Ram temple
 isse vipaksh main bikharaav bhi hoga or sapa basapa jaisi partiyon ke votbank main bhi send lagegi
 Keep in mind that this is an important and final opportunity in front of the Modi government just before the election to send a message between saints and voters
 janvari se prayag main shuru ho rahe kumbh ke dauraan bhi sarkaar ko sant samaaj ke saamne mandir ke prati apni javabdehi spasht kerani hogi
 The upcoming winter session will be the last session of this government for the Modi government
 iske baad kaa bajet satr ek madhyavadhi bajet ke saath samaapt ho jayega or desh aam chunaav main lag jayega
 It is necessary for the government to instill confidence in the Ram temple among its voters just before the election
 dekhnaa yah he ki sarkaar is vishwaas ko jataane ke liye kis seemaa tak jaati he
 Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani has said that the much awaited new education policy will be announced on May 26, before the completion of two years of the tenure of the Narendra Modi government
 haal hi main ek kaarykram ke dauraan rajg sarkaar ke do saal puure hone par puche gaye ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha, rashtriya shiksha niti 26 may tak raashtra ke saamne hogi
 He said, under the new education policy, NCERT will solve all the challenges in front of the education system
 unhone saath hi kaha ki in chunautiyon kaa samaadhaan hona jaruri bhi he kyonki chaatro tak kaa kahana he ki vah maharana pratap kii bajaay renesaan arthath punarjagran ke bare main zyada jaanate hai
 On the policy of the UPA government not to fail anyone in the examination till 8th standard in schools, he said that a review is being done and a decision will be taken
 unhone kaha, kisi ko fail nahin karne kii niti ke kaaran kaksha nau main chaatr mukaable ke liye taiyaar nahin hote
 The state governments want to end it

Why should one look down upon either? - Gauahar Khan (@GAUAHAR_KHAN) November 11, 2019 In the second tweet, Gauhar has slammed Shefali for misusing her daughter-in-law term for Devolina
 gauhar ne likhaa, 'bahu turm galat tareeke se vahi istemaal kar rahi hai jo real life main khud ek bahu hai
 i want to ask how being a babe is better, cool and respectful than being a daughter-in-law? Both are cool in their place

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Netanyahu held a road show from Ahmedabad Airport to Sabarmati Ashram, after which the two leaders also visited the ashram
 israeli piem ne mahatma gandhi ko shradhanjali di or iske baad charkha bhi chalaaya
 But during this time a different scene was seen
 jis dauraan israeli piem jameen par baithkar gandhi ji kii charkha chalaa rahe the, us dauraan unki patni sara bhi netanyahu ke saath hi thim
 PM Modi was constantly telling him the importance of charkha

 And extended his hand and supported them

 This is the second time PM Modi has done a road show with a foreign leader

 In the Lok Sabha elections, there was mention of Ram temple in bjp's manifesto
 lekin chunaav bitne ke saath hi ram mandir kaa masalaa jaise gum sa ho gaya
 By the way, if we look at the last few elections, it becomes clear that the issue of construction of Kiram temple is no longer relevant in the elections
 ram mandir andolan kaa cheharaa rahe laal krishna adwani jab 2009 aam chunaav main piem ummidavaar bane the to upi main bijepi ko mahaj 10 siten naseeb ho pai thim
 The Samodwadi Party captured Ayodhya seat for the first time in the 2012 assembly elections, while the BJP candidate had been winning this seat since 1991
 yah is baat kaa sanket tha ki agar bijepi keval ram mandir kaa masalaa uthaae to upi kya, ayodhya main bhi nahin jeet sakati

 Mitrasen Yadav won the Bikapur assembly seat adjacent to Ayodhya on the Samajwadi Party ticket in the 2012 election
 unhone bijepi ke lallu singh ko haraaya tha
 In the by-elections held in this seat after his death last year, the Samajwadi Party gave ticket to Mitrasen Yadav's son who won

 If this happens, the percentage of voting in Muslim-dominated areas of these states can be low and if the mathematics of voting is so, then the candidates of the opposing party of local parties who also vote may benefit from it

 However, keeping in mind the festivals coming during Ramadan and the day of Friday, voting has not been kept on these days

 pele ke anusaar, mesi ko vah isliye chunenge kyonki ronaldo kii apeksha vah khud gol karne ke alaava gol ke avasar banane main zyada kaabil he
 Ronaldo currently leads Spain's top league tournament 'la Liga' with 38 goals, while helping him to 12 goals
 duusari ore mesi ne ab tak 34 gol kiye hai or 15 gol ke avasar banaae
 Can't compare the two, Pelé said, not wanting to pick either of these top two strikers in the world, although he felt Messi's playing for Barcelona is heavy
 spain ke radio channel ne pele ke hawaale se kaha, aisa nahin he ki main mesi or ronaldo main se kisi ek ko adhik pasand karata hum
 When people ask me, i always say that you cannot compare them
 pele ne kaha, 'ronaldo mahaan khilaadi hai, striker ke rup main vah adhik aakraamak hai or adhik gol karne kii kshamta rakhte hai
 Messi is a player who not only scores goals, but also creates goals for his fellow players

 On Saturday, Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman accused the opposition of stalling the Rafael Deal under the leadership of Mamata Banerjee on Saturday, where leaders of the opposition party attended a rally in Kolkata to show solidarity against the Modi government
 nirmala ne vipakshi dalon kii ore se lagaataar kiye ja rahe hamalon par phir se jawaab diya or kaha ki vipakshi rafel deal par galat soochna failaa rahe hai, saath hi yah sawaal bhi daaga ki kya ve korporate pratidwandvita main kathputli ban gaye hai yaa phir 36 fiter jet kii kharid ko nuksaan pahunchane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Defense Minister Sitharaman also said that since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power, since then there is an effort to not allow any middleman to enter the Ministry of Defense

 The attack by the Defense Minister comes a day after the report claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets in place of 126 of the predecessor UPA government was violated

 In Kolkata, Mamta's rally also surrounded the central government on Rafael Deal
 ek din pehle chidambaram ne gheraa It is believed that our ancestors come to the earth and bless us in Pitrupaksha
 ye pitru pashu pakshiyon ke madhyam se hamaare nikat aate hai
 The organisms and animals through which birds consume ancestral food are - cow, dog, crow and ant
 shraadh ke samay inke liye bhi aahaar kaa ek ansh nikaala jaataa he, tabhi shraadh karm purna hota he
 At the time of shraadh, five portions of the food offered to the ancestors are taken out - for the cow, dog, ant, crow and deities
 in paanch anshon kaa arpan karne ko panch bali kaha jaataa he
 How is the sacrificial sacrifice first; First of all, three sacrifices of food are made by burning kanda
 shraadh karm main bhojan ke purv paanch jagah par alag-alag bhojan kaa thodaa-thodaa ansh nikaala jaataa he
 An excerpt is placed on the leaf for the cow, dog, ant and deities and on the ground for crows
 phir prarthana kii jaati he ki inke madhyam se hamaare pitar prasann hon
 Why these five creatures have been chosen
 The dog symbolizes the water element, ant fire element, crow air element, cow earth element and deity symbolizes sky element
 is prakaar in paanchon ko aahaar dekar ham panch tatwon ke prati aabhaar vyakt karte hai
 Only five elements are found simultaneously in the cow
 isliye pitru paksh main gaay kii seva vishesh faldaai hoti he
 Just by feeding and serving the cow, fathers get fulfillment as well as Shraddha Karma is complete
 gaay kii seva se pitaron kaa aashirvadpitru paksh main gaay kii seva se pitaron ko mukti moksh miltaa he
 Also, if the cow is fed fodder, it is equal to the Brahmin feast
 pitru paksh main agar panch gavy kaa prayog kiya jaay, to pitru dosha se mukti mil sakati he
 Also, by donating cow, you can get rid of all kinds of debts and deeds

 sattarudh dal jeet ke liye rashtrawaad kii bhaavana ko bhunaakar ballat box ko apane paksh main bharne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 One could hardly conceive of a novel on this subject
 israel main benjamin netanyahu or turki main recep taip erdogan is raajnneetik kala main varshon se maharath hasil kiye hai
 Whereas this year, there are clearly signs of increasing disinterest in voters
 yadi aapke paas toote vaadon yaa adhuri apekshaaon ke bare main matadaataaon ke prashnon ke uttar nahin hai, to khud ko rashtriya dhvaj main lapetakar or khud ko ekmaatr rakshak ghoshit karke uttar dene se bachane kaa yah kya behatar tarika he
 It is a strategic campaign in which military power is used to induce divisions among voters by using internal and external enemies and creating fear among the people
 jaisaa ki charles di galle ne kaha tha, "deshbhakti tab hoti he jab aapke apane logon kaa pyaar pehle aata he, rashtrawaad tab hota he jab aapke khud ke alaava anya logon ke liye nafrat pehle aati he
 "the underlying sentiment at its core is that the decision in the general election will be on whether voters will give the benefit of doubt to Prime Minister Modi and he will get another term like this
 yah jaanate hue, bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne apana puraa abhiyaan modi ke vyaktitv par kendrit kiya he
 He is being projected as a leader who is unavoidable and who has no alternative
 jiske bina na to bharat kii suraksha hogi, na hi aarthik vikaas hoga
 Therefore, it should be called 'modi Shining' campaign
 san 2014 ke chunaavon ke dauraan bijepi ne tatkaaleen paristhitiyon main modi ko ek aisa anukool ummidavaar mana jiske naam par matadaataaon ko lubhaaya ja sake or record bahumat hasil kiya ja sake
 Not only did the BJP do it but it won the seats in North and West India by a huge margin of one-sided
 usne kai siton par do lakh se adhik voton se vijay hasil kii
 That margin of votes will be useful at this time as the national trend will be normal this time
 san 2014 main jahaan modi lahar ke kaaran bijepi ke liye chunaav maidan bahut aakarshak tha, vahiin is baar vipaksh adhik ekajute he
 In such a situation, it is trying to artificially change these elections in its favor by taking references to Balakot and Pulwama in view of the anti-incumbency effect
 media kaa 90% hissaa bijepi ke paas he, jo modi kii madad karne ke liye choti-moti lahar paidaa karne ke prayaas main laga he
 However this cannot be accomplished so easily in view of the size and complexity of the voters of India
 pichley paanch varshon main jo dekha gaya, matadaataaon kii najaron main media kii chunaav kii nishpaksh kahani naatakeey rup se kam vishwasaneeyata he
 i suspect that among the cheers of Modi, on-the-ground journalists are finding it difficult to maintain balance by recognizing anti-modi voices
 police kii naak ke neeche desh kii rajdhani main dindahaade arvind kejariwal par hamale ko dekhne ke baad, patrakaron ke liye modi virdohi matadaata 'yeti' ho chuke hai, jinhen dhundhna mushkil ho rahaa he
 They will speak at the polling station itself
 dilli main rodsho ke dauraan siem arvind kejariwal ko thappad maaraa gaya
 Despite the outrage arising after the Pulwama attack, there is no presence of panic in the 26 / 11 attack which is prevalent in Sri Lanka after the recent attack
 piem ne is chunavi katha main phaayde ki liye pakistan ki jariye koshish kii he
 However, Imran Khan, by fake means, presented himself as a villain like Musharraf to give BJP an electoral advantage
 balakot or pulavama ko lekar modi ke samarthan main propaganda ko simit kar diya gaya he, jisase ki modi samarthak votaron or disambar main teen rajyon ke chunaav haarane ke baad vivaadit hue party cader ko utsahit kiya ja saktaa tha
 This is no small thing, but also not an electoral game-changer, suggesting something
 iske alaava balakot ke baad rashtrawaad kii bhaavana se laabh uthaane ke liye, dukhi kar dene vaale lambey or jald khatm na hone vaale chunavi kaarykram ke bajaay sheeghra or adhik tej chunaav kaarykram hamaare liye laabhakaari rahaa he
 i doubt that in Punjab, Haryana and eastern Uttar Pradesh on May 19, a large number of voters will be able to leave the house in the heat of extreme temperatures and the nationalist sentiment will dominate the minds of voters
 pakistan bijepi ke chunaav abhiyaan ke centre main rahaa he
 The party says it taught Pakistan a lesson by ordering an airstrike on the jaish-e-mohammed terrorist camp
 jaisaa ki bijepi ne kiya he, kareeb puri tarah se rashtravaadi abhiyaan ke sandesh ke prachaar par bharosa karnaa, ek bahut hi jokhim bhari ranneeti he
 If this effect is done, substantial electoral gains can be made; However, if the arrow hits the wrong target, the reverse effect is possible
 pichley hafte pashchim dilli ke maujuuda saansad kaa ek video viral hua
 In this video, when a voter questioned the MP on his record, he replied "bharat Mata ki Jai!" Slogan of isse pehle, bijepi ke 'shubhankar' anupam kher ne chandigarh main apni saansad patni ke record ko lekar patrakaron ke sawaal par bachaav karte hue isi naare kaa sahaara liya tha
 This overwhelming and clumsy strategy may satisfy BJP voters, but a volatile voter deciding the electoral outcome can see things very differently

 It depends on which state they occur

 They cannot be talked about on "good days", jobs, demonetisation or other such poignant topics, which may be issues of genuine interest to voters

 Clearly, this is a massive mistake that has taken place when the nationalist mentality is being carried out in full swing
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha he ki rajeev gandhi ke jivan kaa ant 'bhrashtachari number van' ke rup main hua
 Netanyahu and Erdogan sparked their nationalist politics by building strong national economies
 isse ve matadaataaon ke bich majboot khilaadi kii bhoomika main aae or vishwasaneey bane
 In November 2016, Modi suddenly took the decision of demonetisation as the destiny of the country but despite this Jaitley has assured us that our economy has been in the grip of recession since that time
 gramin arthvyavastha or asangathit kshetra abhi tak ubar nahin paae hai

 If these troubles are to be overcome after May 23, India will need a cabinet of capable ministers working as a team

 Kosi changed its stream and divided Mithilanchal into two parts geographically
 ek taraf darbhanga or madhubani ho gaye to duusari ore saharsa, madhepura va supaul jaise kshetra rah gaye
 Many leaders tried to reach power after independence by showing the dream of building this bridge of Mithilanchal, but the dreams of the people of the region did not materialize
 varsh 2003 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne is mahatvakankshi pariyojna kii neenv rakhi
 The construction of a bridge over the Kosi river, called the 'mourning of Bihar', was also a crook

 Rajaram Prasad of Nirmali in Supaul says that Wednesday is not just a day for Supaul, but a festival for all Mithilanchal residents

 Union Sports Minister (independent Charge) Ajay Maken on Friday welcomed the decision of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) President Suresh Kalmadi not to continue the work but also said that Kalmadi should resign from the post

 Maken said, "kalmadi has made a valid decision not to continue the work of the IOA but he has not resigned from this post
 kisi aaropee ko khel sangh kii kursi par nahin bane rahane dena chahie
 Moreover, the decision should not be left on whether he wants to remain in this chair or not
 " Kalmadi neither wants to continue in the post of president nor wants to resign
 kalmari guuruuvaar ko jamaanat par reeha hue the
 That is why Kalmadi has already asked the executive chairman Vijay Kumar Malhotra to continue working
 kalmari ne ek patr ke madhyam se ioe kaa kaam jari rakhane ko kaha
 Maken said that the proposed sports bill is quite capable of preventing such a situation
 maujuuda niyamon ke anusaar kalmari jamaanat par reeha hone ke saath hi ioe kaa adhyaksh banane kaa puraa haq rakhte hai
 The reason for this is that he neither resigned from this post nor was he dismissed by the executive
 aise main kalmadi ko ioe ke varisht upaadhyaksh or kaaryakari adhyaksh se apni kursi hasil karne kaa puraa haq he
 The comments kalmari rashtramandal khel aayojan samiti ke adhyaksh rah chuke hai

 With almost every batting record in the cricket world, it has become a habit to see the name of Sachin Tendulkar, but do you know, there is a record even today, in which the master blaster is not only number 52 worldwide, In India too, Rahul Dravid, Virender Sehwag, Sourav Ganguly, VVS Laxman and Sunil Gavaskar are far ahead of them
 
 
 yah record he kisi ek test match main sabase zyaada ran banane kaa, jisamen sheersh par hai england ke graham gooch, jinhone varsh 1990 main bharat ke khilaaf lords ke maidan main khele gaye match kii donon pariyon main shatak thoke, jinamein se ek tihara shatak tha
 With his brilliant innings of 333 and 123 runs, Gooch scored a total of 456 runs in the match, which is the highest personal score in a match to date
 is suchi main bharat kii ore se sabase upar 17wein sthaan par purv captain sunil gavaskar kaa naam darj he, jinhone varsh 1971 main port of spain ke maidan main west indies ke khilaaf match main 124 or 220 ranon kii paariyaan khelkar kul 344 ran banaae
 Following him on the list is Indian VVS Laxman, who stands in 21st place with 340 runs, thanks to 59 and 281 runs scored in both innings of the historic Test match played against Australia in Kolkata
 is list main aglaa bhartiya naam purv captain saurav ganguli kaa he, jo 25wein sthaan par darj hai
 He scored a total of 330 runs in 2007, playing 239 and 91 runs against arch-rivals Pakistan in Bengaluru
 purv salaami ballebaaj virendra sahvaag bharat kii ore se ekmaatr aise khilaadi hai, jinka naam is list main do baar darj he, or is tarah unke donon tihare shatak is suchi main shaamil ho gaye
 An interesting fact is that both times India won the match by a margin of innings, and Virender Sehwag did not get a chance to bat for the second time, otherwise he would have been recorded higher up this list
 30wein sthaan par sahvaag kii dakshin africa ke khilaaf chennai main kheli 319 ranon kii pari darj he, jabaki 41wein sthaan par unki multan main kheli 309 ranon kii vah aitihaasik pari darj he, jo unhone varsh 2004 main pakistan ke khilaaf kheli thi
 Significantly, India has scored triple test centuries only twice in history, and both came off the bat of Virender Sehwag
 suchi main iske baad 44wein sthaan par bharat ke 'mistar dependable' or 'mistar wal' kahe jane vaale purv captain rahul dravid darj hai, jinhone edilade main varsh 2003 main australia ke khilaaf 233 or 72* kii paariyaan khelkar kul 305 ran banaae the
 Sachin Tendulkar is ranked 52nd after Rahul, who is the last Indian in this list of players who have scored 300 or more runs in a single match
 sachin ne bhi australia ke hi khilaaf varsh 2004 main sidney ke maidan main 241* or 60* ranon kii paariyaan khelkar kul 301 ran banaae the
 This is the record for the most runs scored in a single Test match, at the top of which is England's Graham Gooch, who scored a century in both innings of the match played at Lord's ground against India in 1990, one of which was a triple century
 
 333 or 123 ranon kii apni shandaar pariyon kii badaulat gooch ne match main kul 456 ran thoke, jo aaj tak ek match main sarvaadhik nijee score kaa vishwarecord he
 At the top of this list, India has ranked 17th in the name of former captain Sunil Gavaskar, who scored a total of 344 runs in innings of 124 and 220 runs in the 1971 match against West Indies at the Port of Spain ground
 suchi main unke baad darj bhartiya vivies lakshmana hai, jo australia ke khilaaf kolkata main khele gaye aitihaasik test match kii donon pariyon main banaae 59 or 281 ranon kii badaulat 340 ranon ke saath 21wein sthaan par kabiz hai
 The next Indian name in this list is that of former captain Sourav Ganguly, who is ranked 25th
 unhone varsh 2007 main bengaluru main chir-pratidwandvi pakistan ke khilaaf 239 or 91 ranon kii paariyaan khelkar match main kul 330 ran banaae the
 Former opener Virender Sehwag is the only player from India to be named twice in this list, and thus his two triple centuries were included in this list
 ek dilachasp tathy yah bhi he ki donon hi baar bharat ne match pari ke antar se jeeta, or virendra sahvaag ko duusari baar ballebaaji kaa mauka hi nahin mila, varanaa shaayad vah is suchi main or upar darj kiye jate
 At 30th, Sehwag has an innings of 319 runs against South Africa in Chennai, while at 41st, he has a 309-run historic innings in Multan which he played against Pakistan in 2004
 gauratlab he ki bharat kii ore se itihaas main keval do baar tihare test shatak bane hai, or donon hi virendra sahvaag ke balle se nikle
 Next on the list is 44th ranked India's 'mr
 Dependable' and former captain Rahul Dravid, who scored 233 and 72 * innings against Australia in 2003 in Adelaide
 rahul ke baad 52wein sthaan par darj hai sachin tendulkar, jo ek hi match main 300 yaa adhik ran banane vaale khilaadiyon kii is suchi main antim bhartiya hai
 Sachin also scored a total of 301 runs in the year 2004 against Australia in Sydney, playing 241 * and 60 * runs

 The kidnapping (or death !!) of Bhanwari Devi, an ANM of Rajasthan, known for its high reach among the people with influence, has become a mess for the Ashok Gehlot government of the state
 do hafte se laapata is 36 varshiya sughad natni ke latake-jhtakon or uski bhavy jeevanstyli ke kisse ab logon kii jabaan par aa gaye hai
 Her husband Amarchand Rajnat has now directly accused Mahipal Maderna, the state health minister and strong leader of the Jat lobby
 ''maderna mere ghar par bivi ko phone karte the
 We also said that Saab, we are small men, why bother us? ”as soon as he saw the possibility of his neck getting stuck, Gehlot presented the matter to the CBI, showing unexpected speed
 pradesh ke grih mantri shanti dhariwal ne to haalanki yahi kaha ki maderna kii rajamandi se maamla sibiai ko saunpa gaya he
 But it was shocking to everyone as the police, led by Umesh Mishra, the IG of Jodhpur, had apprehended the people charged for the abduction of Bhanwari
 unheen main se ek ashok ko sikar jile ke ramgarh se pakadaa gaya tha
 Now the police was looking for Bhanwari or his corpse
 kuchhek din or intjaar karne kii bajaae gahalot ne maamla sibiai ke hawaale kar diya
 Please tell here that Bhanwari was an ANM at Jaliwara Khurd sub-health Center in Bilada area of jodhpur
 vahaan vah bas dastakhat karne jaati thi
 No one was asked to bother anyone
 jodhpur police ko yakeen he ki bhavari ko swasthya mahakme ke thekedaar sohanlal vishnoi ne phone karke bulaayaa tha
 He is a relative of Congress MLA Malkhan Singh and son of the late Congress leader Ram Singh Vishnoi, who was removed by Gehlot in his last term as a minister
 unka ek betaa avaidh drug factory chalaate pakadaa gaya tha
 According to police sources, the detained person is not spewing out whether he killed Bhanwari or not, but according to a police officer, "sohanlal and this person have given some conclusive clues that connect the case to a VCD Huh
 '' ek baar apartaaon ne laash ko jhansi ke paas gaad dena kabuula par vahaan talab niklaa
 Here in Rajasthan, especially in Marwar region, everyone wants to know more and more about Bhanwari and its functioning
 tabhi to usne gaanon ke albamon kii bikri bhi dhadlle se shuru ho gai he, jinamein bhavari ne abhinay kiya he
 Kunwar Tejaji album made by Shri Krishna Krishna Cassettes of Jodhpur is selling strongly
 ram bharose gaadi or nai jaau sasrie bhi kaaphi charchaa main hai
 Through these albums, people are trying to get to know Bhanwari closely
 bhavari or maderna kii visidi kii charchaa to maheenon se thi or gahalot ko bhi iske sanket de die gaye the
 He tells Maderna to be cautious on this
 pataa nahin, visidi he bhi yaa ki maderna ko nicha dikhaane ke liye yah ek propeganda he
 Gehlot will be happy with this because it will give him an opportunity to settle the accounts with his father Parasram Maderna, who opposed the appointment of Gehlot as the Chief Minister
 bhavari ke phone byore bataate hai ki vah dheron logon se batiyaati thi
 Among them was a person from Nagaur, who has been hesitant to come for questioning
 par hairat kii baat he ki police bhavari ke pichley saalon ke kol detel nahin dekh rahi he, jisase pataa chal saktaa he ki maderna uske sampark main the yaa nahin
 If the call detail gives sufficient evidence against ADG Arvind Jain and former minister Rajendra Rathore in a fake encounter case, then why is the police keeping silent about the details of the call detail in this case? The suspects have been in his possession for several days
 aise main unase paryaapt kargar saboot nikaale ja sakate hai
 It would have been better if Gehlot had got his police investigated in a professional manner and reached a conclusion
 par lagata he ki hameshaa kii tarah unhone siyaasi nateezon kii zyada phikr kii he
 He has tried to show his neutrality to Jat voters by giving the case to CBI, which is Maderna's representative
 lekin unke ek mantri kaa is tarah ghirna unke mukhyamantritv par bhi sawaal khadey karata he India has once again accused Pakistan of lying

 He said that Pakistan is still not taking any action against the terrorists
 balakot par ham behad aashwast hai ki ham safal rahe hai
 Pakistan has prevented journalists from going there
 vah maamle ko chhipaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The Foreign Ministry said that the UN had said that the terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed was involved in the Pulwama attack, but Pakistan is denying it
 jaish ko pakistan kyon bachaa rahaa he or uske pravaktaa kii tarah kyon bayaan de rahaa he
 If Pakistan claims itself to be a 'new Pakistan' with 'new thinking' then it should take 'new action' against the terrorists
 Raveesh kumar,mea: If as Pakistan claims it has a video recording of the downing of a second Indian aircraft then why have they not shared the video with international media?pic
 twitter

Eyewitnesses and the electronic evidence we have is that Pakistan used the F-16 aircraft and the mig-21 of Wing Commander Abhinandan was attacked from the F-16 itself
