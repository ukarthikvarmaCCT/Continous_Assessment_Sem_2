 Political analyst Rajkumar Singh said that the way BSP chief Mayawati has won more seats in the Lok Sabha, Mayawati's strategy is to mobilize Dalits and Muslims
 muslimon ko lagata he ki akhilesh ke saath judane se sirf yadav vot bank ke saath judate the
 If they join Mayawati, there will be a good alliance between Dalits and Muslims
 usase akhilesh kaa muslim vot bank prabhavit hoga

 akhilesh ke paas muslim kii koi badi aawaaj bhi nahin bachi he
 Even if he is Azam, he works in his own way
 rajkumaar ne bataaya ki akhilesh ko upachunaav main acchhee ladaai ladani he to muslim vot ko bachaana hoga
 The backward vote bank has been completely eroded from them
 muslimon kaa maananaa he ki jo bhaajapa ko haraayega, usee ore vah apana rukh karenge
 Mayawati's voice matters because she is speaking out loud that Akhilesh could not keep Dalits with him and could not handle Muslims either
 aise main sapa ke saath janaa bekaar he
 So, now Akhilesh faces many challenges, which he will have to deal with

 Now, due to which Muslims joined the alliance, Mayawati took credit for the competition
 akhilesh der se aae
 Now he is busy in describing himself as Muslim friendly
 yah basapa ke muslim ko jodne kaa phalop he
 But it is too late for the SP
 akhilesh ko zyada mehnat kerani padegi
 He told that Muslims feel that Mulayam and Azam had the courage to take the SP along
 mulaayam niskriy ho gaye hai
 Azam is now doing Delhi politics
 isiilie akhilesh yah bhaanp gaye the
 That is why he started talking about building Vishnu temple or going to other temples
 yah muslimon ko nagavaar gujri he, isiilie vah apana rukh basapa kii ore kar sakate hai

 yadav birdari ke anya dalon main gaye kai puraane netaa bhi sapa main vaapasi ke bajaay basapa ko hi pasand kar rahe he
 In such a situation, it will not be easy to keep the Muslims connected with the SP till 2022
 "ek varisht muslim sapa netaa ne kaha ki bahujan samaaj party (basapa) se muslimon kaa prem sthaayee nahin ho saktaa, kyonki bhaajapa se kai baar samjhauta kar chuki mayawati kaa koi bharosa nahin he

 80 seats of Uttar Pradesh are considered as the biggest bets for this Lok Sabha election
 bijepi or congress donon dalon ke piem daavedaar, yaheen se chunaav maidan main hai
 And the Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Mulayam Singh, who is dreaming of the Third Front's patronage, is also thrashing from here
 bijepi jahaan gaiyr-muslim votaron ke dhruvikaran kii raajnneeti main lagi he vahiin congress, sapa or bispi chaahati hai ki 18
 Even if 5 percent of Muslim votes are outright, they should come in their favor in a big way
 yahi sameekaran sapa ke diggaj netaa mohammad ajam khan ko uttar pradesh kii siyasat kaa sabase dilachasp kirdaar bana detaa he
 Azam Khan came to the foremost discussion these days with his statement in which he said, “kargil hills were not conquered by any Hindu
 vahaan naaraa e takabeer allaa hu akbar lagaakar sabase pehle musalmaan sainik gaye the
 "azam repeated this statement in several public meetings in western Uttar Pradesh including Ghaziabad and Muzaffarnagar
 yahi nahin, india today se baatcheet main unhone desh main aatankwaad par doharaa maapdand apnaane kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 up's Minority Welfare Minister said, "the execution of the killers of the country (rajiv Gandhi) and the killers of Beant Singh are waived and one innocent is hanged
" ” kya begunaah se unka matlab sansad par hamale ke aaropee afjal guru kii faansee se he to ajam khan ne kaha, “haa, aap supreme court kaa faisla uthaakar padhie
 You will also know
 ” darasal yahi ajam khan kaa andaaj he
 They say their point with impunity and often leave the task of finding out the facts on the front
 is chunaav main ve apni taraf se aisi koi koshish nahin chhod rahe jo musalamaanon ko ajam khan ke netaa mulaayam singh kii taraf laane main madadgaar sabit ho
 In such a situation, the media took a dig at Azam by saying that he is coloring the army in communal color
 lekin unki party ne unke khilaaf ek shabd tak nahin kaha
 Two days later, Mulayam Singh and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav defended their minister
 yuva mukhyamantri ne maamle ko siyaasi dhar dete hue kaha, “ajam khan par isliye hamalaa ho rahaa he kyonki unke naam main khan laga he
 "actually, Azam Khan is the helplessness of SP
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ve sapa main nahin the or party kii siten 2004 kii 34 siton se ghatakar 21 rah gai thim
 Akhilesh's wife Dimple Yadav lost from Firozabad Lok Sabha by-election in his absence in the party
 netaji kii siyasat ke liye yah bada aghat tha
 That is why Azam Khan's return to the SP in a very emotional atmosphere after the elections was done for this day
 mulaayam se apane rishton kii baangi pesh karte hue tab ajam ne kaha tha, “phir khushi se khushi kii taraf nahin dekha, tumhaare baad kisi kii taraf nahin dekha
 "and the result of this meeting came in the form of sp's bumper victory in the 2012 assembly elections
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav main tasviir duusari he
 On the one hand there is a stir of BJP leader Narendra Modi, on the other hand, more than 100 big and small riots including Muzaffarnagar are registered in the SP government's account
 zyaadaatar dangon main maar musalmaan ne hi khai he
 Maintaining such hurt Muslims with SP is Azam Khan's biggest challenge
 kahin isi kathin kaam ko saadhane ke liye to aap kargil jaise bayaan nahin de rahe, is sawaal par ajam ne kaha, “mujhe sena ke ek afasar ne khud yah baat bataai thi
 The officer said that the army put forward Muslim soldiers as a strategy
 in sainikon ne allaa hu akbar ke naare lagaae jisase pakistani sainikon main gafalat paidaa hui
 Pakistani soldiers came out and the Indian Army attacked them
 ”ajam ke in bolon par duusare dalon ne tikhaa hamalaa kiya
 Congress was also included in the attacking parties
 or jis gajiabad main ajam khan ne yah bayaan diya tha vahaan ke bijepi pratyaashee or purv senadhyaksh general ve
 K
 singh ne kaha, “sena ko dharmik aadhaar baantkar ajam khan gandi siyasat kar rahe hai
 "but such questions were rejected by Azam Khan, Chancellor of Jauhar University in Rampur, saying," If Muslims want to be at the forefront of sacrificing for the country, then you also have a problem
 ”lekin unke ye bayaan sapa ke liye duusari tarah se bhi dikkat laa sakate hai
 It is possible that these statements will prove to be helpful to connect Muslims with the SP to some extent, but there is also a possibility that the rest of the voters will not be spoiled from the party
 party kii ranneeti dekhakar ab tak yahi lagata he ki mulaayam singh yah maanakar chal rahe hai ki yadav voter kisi surat main party se kinaaraa nahin kar saktaa
 But the way Modi has tied the knot of development with leadership, it should not come as a surprise if unexpected results emerge
 uttar pradesh main jis tarah chautarafa muqabla he, usamen ek-ek vot apana mol sabit karne vaala he
 But the Yadav family itself has to do the work of wooing these voters
 isiilie ajam ke khaas sahyogi or party ke rajyasabha saansad choudhary munwwar saleem sari baatcheet kii disha modate hue ise sampradayik nazariye se dekhne kii bajaae raashtra prem ke nazariye se dekhne kii himaayat karte hai
 Munawwar argues, "the bjp's plight is that it also makes the sacrifice of Muslims a controversy
" khan sahab ne sarhadon kii hifaazat karne vaale musalmaan kii charchaa hi to kii he
 If it is a crime to sacrifice (discuss) the sacrifice of Muslims in Kargil war, then what is the definition of nationalism
 ”sapa main mulaayam singh yadav or akhilesh ke baad sabase zyada sabhaayen karne vaale ajam iklaute netaa hai
 They are having single meetings in Muslim dominated areas
 garmi ke dinon main apni rampuri topi utarkar rakh dene or clin shev ke baavjood ajam khan is samay badi-badi dadhi vaale netaaon par baari pad rahe hai
 Azam Khan, who was honored at the hands of the saints in Allahabad for the successful organization of the Kumbh Mela two years ago, once again appears like a Muslim leader with his bold statements
 unke pragatisheel vichaar media ke camaron kii jadon se baahar hai or 1990 ke dashak kii chhavi jor maar rahi he

" china lagaataar badha rahaa he apni takat
 a month ago, China did a military exercise to show the world a glimpse of its strength
 ab khabaren aa rahi hai ki agle kuch dinon main china apni mixilon ke zakhiren kii numaaish karne vaala he
 He wants to make the world realize his threat through a missile that can hit 12000 kilometers
 america bhi chini missile kii jad mensutron ke anusaar is baar ek oktober ko neshnal de par china kuch aisi mixilon kaa pradarshan karne vaala he jo abtak uske bede main shaamil nahin hui hai
 The world is not yet aware of these missiles
 ye misile china ne kab or kaise taiyaar kii hai isaki bhanak tak kisi ko nahin lagi he
 The news leaked when the missiles are ready and are about to join the army soon
 china kii pipuls librasion army ke sutron se mili khabaron ke mutabik chini missile ke nae bede main lambii duuri se lekar choti duuri tak kii missile shaamil hone vaali hai
 The deadliest among them would be the Dongfeng 41 i
e
 DF 41 missile
 is missile kii range itani he ki bharat kii to baat hi chhodie america ke kai shahar bhi is missile kii jad main honge
 In terms of distance, the distance from Shanghai to Los Angeles is 6438 miles while the DF 41 has a range of 12,000 kilometers i
e
 7500 miles
 vahiin china ke pashchimi seemaa se neuyork kii duuri he 6945 mile
 Whereas Seattle's distance from the eastern border of China is just 4,349 miles
 vahiin alaska se china ke purvi seemaa kii duuri he mahajad 2,606 mile
 That is, all these areas of America will be easily in the range of DF 41
 pehle se khatarnaak hogi mixilon kii nai khepavisheshgyon kaa daawa he ki china ke belistic mixilon kii nai khep pehle se kahin zyada khatarnaak hogi
 If the range is increased, its speed will also be faster than before
 saath hi nishaanaa bhi pehle se kahin zyada sateek hoga
 Only one missile technology has been reported
 jaahir he china kii mixilon kii nai khep ne america ko bhi chintaa main daal diya he
 There is no information about what kind of weapons China has equipped with these missiles
 par ummid yahi jataai ja rahi he ki isaki maarak kshamta pehle se kaaphi zyada hogi
 It is suspected that China has also equipped these missiles with nuclear power
 china kii sena main shaamil ho raheen baaki kii mixilon kii kshamta kaa abhi tak andaaza bhi nahin he
 Awaiting the parade when China will bring these missiles to the world
 tab ahsaas ho sakegaa ki china takat jutaney kii kii hode main kitna bada khatra banataa ja rahaa he
 Trying to put pressure on India, if experts are to be believed, China is also trying to exert pressure on India by demonstrating this power
 china or bharat ke bich seemaa vivaad sulajh nahin paaya he
 According to experts, till now China has been harassing India through Pakistan
 par jab se pakistan ke andruni halaat kharaab hue hai tab se china apni sainya takat dikhaa kar baar baar bharat ko daraane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 China is currently far ahead of India in the strength of the missile
 china ke jakhire main shaamil mixilon ke saamne bhartiya misile bauni sabit hongi
 While the range of Chinese missile is going to be 12000 km, the range of Indian missile is just 3500 km
 mixilon ke maamle main bharat kaaphi pichhechin ko maaloom he ki duniya kii sabase badi shakti banane main bharat hi he sabase bada roda
 Therefore, with the threat of missiles, China wants to make India realize that it is the most powerful
 mixilon kii taaqat main bharat kaa palada china ke mukaable halkaa padataa dikhaai detaa he
 Even before the introduction of new missiles, both China's firepower and range were much higher than India
 china kaa bada hissaa bharat ke paas maujuud prithvi or agni mixilon kii range se baahar he
 Agni missiles, which can hit long distances, are either in the development stage or are under testing
 bharat kii sabase lambii duuri tak maar karne vaali agni 3 kii range 3500 kilometre he jabaki china kii nai missile deef-41, 12000 kilometre tak hamalaa kar sakati he
 brahmos increased India's strength, although brahmos' inclusion in the naval fleet has increased India's strength significantly
 is supersonic cruge missile ko kisi bhi pandubbi se choda ja saktaa he
 Its firepower can be gauged from the fact that it can strike up to 290 kilometers away
 khasayit ye he ki mahaj 10 meter kii oonchai par ud rahe vimaanon ko bhi ye aasaani se nishaanaa bana sakati he
 On the other hand, China has a large stock of reliable intercontinental and medium range missiles
 sabase badi chintaa kii baat ye he ki bharat ke sabhi raksha thikaane china kii mixilon kii jad main he jabaki bharat ke missile china ke shaharon par hamalaa to kar sakate hai par unke raksha thikaanon tak nahin pahunch sakate
 Obviously, the new missiles of China will cause trouble for India
 america ke paas he china kaa todlekin haal ke dinon main bharat ne jis tarah missile interceptor takanic kaa safaltaapurvak pareekshan kiya he usase chini mixilon kii takat naakaam kii ja sakati he
 But if anyone has a cut of Chinese missiles, it is America
 america ne na sirf badi taadaad main interkantinental belistic misile tainaat kar rakhi hai balki duniya ke kisi kone se aane vaali mixilon ko hawa main maar giraane kii takanic bhi uske paas he
 The world has also got an idea of the tremendous power of the American army in the war of Iraq and Afghanistan
 jaahir he aise main america kii bharat se badhati nazadikiyaan china ko baichaiyn karengi
 Maybe this is the reason why China has been continuously increasing its military capability for the last few years
 apni sena ko nai or aadhunik takanic or mixilon se las kar rahaa he
 Perhaps this is why China has often been showing its strength under the pretext of military exercises

 Indira's slogan was "poverty Remove" and Indira targeted her opponents and said that i want to remove poverty and they want to remove Indira

 dillike chikitsakon, vaigyanikon or paryaavarnavidon kaa kahana he ki rashtriya rajdhani menvaayu pradooshanaka str is had tak khatarnaak sthiti par pahunch chukaa he ki yahaan dhumrapaan nahin karne vaale log bhi rojaanaa chah se satcigaretpi rahe hai, yani dhuaan nigal rahe hai
 Environmentalist and Nirvana Being founder Jayadhar Gupta told IANS here, PM2
 5 naino partical hote hai jo 2
 Are smaller than 5 microns
 yah kisi cheez ke jalane, audyogic pradooshan, vaahanon se nikalne vaale dhuen se paidaa hote hai
 The black carbon that sticks to the fan is PM2
 5 hota he
 It is filled in our air
 unhone kaha, dabluechao ke maanakon ke mutabik, iskaa surakshit str 15 microgram prati cubic meter he
 Whereas in 2016, the full year average was 143 micrograms per cubic meter, which was more than 90 percent
 vaigyanikon ne kaha ki paryaavaran main jab piem2
 If the level of 5 is 22 micrograms per cubic meter, it is equal to a cigarette
 us hisaab se 143 se jab is sankhya ko bhaag karte hai to din kii kareeb 6 se saat cigarette banati hai
 We smoke so much cigarettes
 jaidhar gupta ne kaha, sardiyon main jab paali jalaane kii shuruyaat hoti he or uskaa dhuaan jab yahaan pahunchataa he to rashtriya rajdhani main piem2
 The level of 5 rises from 1000 to 1200 micrograms per cubic meter, then the number rises to the equivalent of 40 to 50 cigarettes
 is khataranakvaayu pradooshanse suraksha ke sawaal par paryaavaranvid ne kaha, isse bachane kaa ekmaatr upaay he en-95 mask, iske alaava logon ke paas koi doosraa vikalp nahin he

 But now its number has increased to 50 percent
 kyonki 50 fisadi maamle ab dhumrapaan nahin karne waalon ke aa rahe hai jinhen fefdon kaa cancer ho rahaa he
 Dr
 kumaar ne kaha, haal hi main america ke barkale arth sanghathan ne ek study kii he, jisamen fefdon or sharir ke anya hisson ko nuksaan pahunchane vaale piem2
 a capacity of 5 was correlated with cigarette smoke, their conclusion being that 22 micrograms of cubit meter PM2
 5 ek cigarette ke baraabar he
 If you come in contact with 22 micrograms for 24 hours, then your body is suffering from a cigarette
 unhone kaha, agar ham dilli ke ek saal kaa ausat dekhen to yah 140 se 150 microgram cubic meter rahaa, jise bhaag karne par yah chah se saat cigarette banataa he
 That is why we all Delhiites have smoked at least six to seven cigarettes every day, while in winter its number reaches 10 to 40 cigarettes
 pichley saal piem2
 Non-smoking people also smoked 40 to 50 cigarettes if the level of 5 had gone up significantly

 Then i told him that it is okay, but what you are doing is just vote bank politics, because a mask of 10 to 15 rupees will not save anyone's health, then it will be thrown in the garbage, and by putting it in a house a fire will be set up, which will cause further pollution, so i refuse them

 On the one hand, after 1989, for the first time, voters are giving some new signals to the national parties like Congress and BJP, and in this gesture, thank SP and BSP
 yadi ham mayawati or mulaayam kii reliyon par najar daalen to fark saaf dikhegaa
 Mulayam said in his old attitude, "I mean SP is important because no government can be formed in the center without its cooperation
" '' ve janata se milte hai, muskuraate hai, unki baat sunate hai
 On the other hand, Mayawati gets down from the helicopter and sits in an air-conditioned vehicle to the aerated stage and welcomes the public by simply shaking her hands, reading speeches and returning from the air-conditioned car to the chopper
 janata ke liye unka manch tak paidal na chalanaa bhi rajnatik adaa he
 Sometimes they do not even consider the Congress and the BJP to be named
 keval kahati hai, 'hamaare virdohi dal
 
 
 "by coincidence, Mayawati does not yet realize how much land has slipped from under her feet or what piece of new land has come to her share
" jaraa sochie ki aakhir unhen kyon ehsaas nahin ki dalit vot bank main daraar pad chuki he or brahman unase dur hote ja rahe hai
 But this time people do not mean who is telling who, whom, what
 ve basapa or sapa ke liye bahut utsahit nahin dikhte
 The reason is that their ears are caught by the echo of the words punk and mafia
 ellection watch ke aankadon ke anusaar, ''chunaav ke pehle teen charnon main basapa ne 18, sapa ne 27, bhaajapa ne 15 or congress ne 12 aise ummidavaar utaare, jin par aapraadhik maamle hai
 Heinous crimes are registered against 65 of them
 ''matadaataaon kaa kahana he ki jabase kshetreey dalon kaa shashan aayaa he tabase mafiagiri or lut hi badi he
 They say, Mayawati came to power in 2007 by calling Mulayam Raj a Gunda Raj and now Mulayam and other parties are accusing him that instead of fulfilling the promise of Mafia cleansing, he won the election and sent them to Delhi to mafia donors She gave him up and started calling him 'the messiah of the poor'
 mulaayam par hamalaa karte hue jahaan mayawati apni sabhaaon main kahati hai, ''chadh gundon kii chaati par, vot padegaa hathi par'' to mulaayam ke samarthak gum-ghumkar ga rahe hai, ''gunde chadh gaye hathi par, goli maaren chaati par
 That means goons all around
 
 
 gunde kii gunj
 not only this
 ek ore jahaan bhukhmaree or garibi fail rahi he, vahiin matdaan ke teen charnon main keval 118 ummidavaar karodpati the
 Of these, 27 belong to the BSP
 lakhanu ke ek matadaata or rajnatik- aarthik maamalon ke vishleshak surendra rajput kehete hai, ''garibi hataane ke bajaae netaaon or partiyon ke liye garibon ko chidhaane kaa isse acha tarika or kya ho saktaa he
 "but the old socialists are watching this election from another point of view
 sapa ke pravaktaa rajendra choudhary kehete hai ki yah chunaav raajnneeti ko vichaardhaara kii patari se utaarne kii koshish ke khilaaf he
 According to him, this election is a vote against development and against corruption and dictatorship
 ''pichley do saal main uttar pradesh har kshetra main jiro par pahunch chukaa he or garibon ke sapanom ko dabaaya ja rahaa he
 The state government has fallen victim to officer-leaders-mafia gangs
 ''udhar congress ke varisht rashtriya netaa or jujharu samaajawaadee prishthbhumi vaale mohan prakaash kehete hai ki yah chunaav ek bade badlaav kii ore sanket de rahaa he
 He said that after 1990, the public saw everyone and then got bored of them
 isliye aaj desh ke sabase bade rajya uttar pradesh sahit har jagah sab kii ummid congress par tiki he
 But Hriday Narayan Dixit, the chief spokesperson and author of the BJP, says development is not an issue before the government because it has no value in the eyes of the Chief Minister
 ve kabhi rashtriya vikaas parishad kii baithak main nahin jaatin or aise adhikariyon ko bhejti hai jo dilli main kuch bol nahin pate
 On the other hand, the UPA government at the Center remained for five years and in the meantime the governments of Mulayam Singh and Mayawati went and formed
 unke anusaar, uttar pradesh ke saansad kabhi apane pradesh kaa maamla sansad main uthaate nahin kyonki unamem kshetravaad kii bhaavana hi nahin he
 They only talk about their leader
 chunki dikshit tikaakar bhi hai, isliye dur kii sochate hai
 The purpose of Rajya Sabha in the Constitution was the assembly of states where mps raise the state, but today Rajya Sabha goes to anyone who knows the national leadership or corporate giants or sometimes mafia type people
 alaakaman, korporate diggaj or mafia rajya yaa janata kii kyon sochen or jinhen janata chunakar bhejti he, jo rajya kaa maamla uthaa sakate hai, ve alpsankhya main aa jate hai
 Therefore, according to him, now the public wants something new so that, irrespective of the government, Delhi looks towards Uttar Pradesh
 dilachasp he ki basapa desh kii iklauti party he jiskaa na koi agenda he or na hi ghoshnaa patr
 Yet the public votes only on Mayawati and on the same basis, gradually a regional party (even if it is in the category of national) is showing national ambitions
 iskaa kaaran he iskaa aankada
 In every general election since 1991, the BSP has been contesting more than 200 seats and its vote share gradually increased to just 1
 80 pratishat ke mukaable san 2004 ke chunaavon main 5
 Reached 33 percent
 bich main 1996 main party ne 11
 21 per cent of the votes were also received when the Election Commission declared it as a national party and allotted the elephant's permanent election mark

 Demonetisation and GST made banking in the country expensive
 november 2016 main notebandi lagu hone ke baad bainkon dwaara milane vaali kai muft sevaaon par charge laga diya gaya tha
 Then the GST introduced from July, taxed these charges, making banking service expensive for the common man
 desh main bainkon ne bade hue bankig chargees ko acchhee suvidha dene k liye jaruri bataaya to rigerv bank ne kaha ki isse bank ko chalaane kaa kharch kam kiya ja sakegaa
 But now the bank customers are not getting the plea of the central government and RBI, due to which the charges being charged by the banks on different forums are being called up to arbitrary extortion
 lagaataar badhati shikayaton ke chalate kendra sarkaar or rigerv bank bhi ab maamle par gambhirtha se vichaar kar rahi he
 Know how the collection is being done by banks - Transaction charge is being charged from the account holders after limited free withdrawal from bank branch and ATM
 - electronic transfar jaise neft, artijies or upiai sevaaon kaa istemaal karne ke charge main ijapha- ek free checkbuk ke baad nai checkbuk lene par bank dwaara fees lee ja rahi he
 - Bank is charging fees for customers using mobile wallets
 - in sabhi chargees par bank dwaara jiesti ke naam par bhi graahakon se paisa vasula ja rahaa he

 Banks are now able to increase their earnings by cutting the interest rate that customers get when they keep money in the bank
 in sabhi kadamon ko jaij tehraane ke liye bank kii daleel he ki is kadam se unke liye infrastracchar cost main lagaataar ijapha ho rahaa he
 The cost of expanding its services to banks and running the existing branches is rising
 iske alaava bainkon kii daleel he ki pehle ke mukaable desh main banking suvidha main bada sudhaar darj hua he
 The cost of this improved banking also needs to be borne by the customers
 vahiin bainkon kii yah bhi daleel he ki tranjaction charge keval bharat main nahin liya ja rahaa he
 Such charges are collected from customers in banks around the world
 graahakon ko uthaanaa pad rahaa duube karj kaa khamiyajadesh main bank kii sabase badi samasya gande karj he

 aaj se kareeb 2 maheene pehle dilli main bacchon se chori karaane kii kai vaaradaate saamne ai thim
 She was incomplete
 kyonki is maamle kii tafteesh abhi bhi jari he
 But today we are going to tell you the whole truth of this story
 ye ek aisa sach he jo desh ko sochane par majaboor kar degaa
 Because the case is not just about stealing or a handful of thieves
 balki hindustan ke bachapan or us bachapan ke bhavishya kii chori kaa he
 There is an area just 700 km from Delhi, where childhood training camps are run
 masuumon ke haath, shaatiron kaa dimagsbako pataa he ki desh ke bade shaharon main jab-jab shehanai ke bich sannata pasre to samaj lijie chori ho chuki he
 To avoid theft in marriage, install a security guard but nothing will happen
 or jab tak sisitivi khangaalenge tab tak der ho chuki hogi
 The precious goods, which were cleaned with little hands, passed through the ravines of the country
 empi ke rajgad ke gulkhedi gaanv main pahunch chukaa hota he
 We continue to regret the fact that the world is bad
 ab to bachche bhi chori karne lage hai
 Even if the eyes are not open till now, open them
 kyonki in vaardaaton ko anjaam dene vaale haath bhale hi masuumon ke hon magar iske peeche dimag shaatiron kaa he
 Gangs deal with children in Natlakh, only a state would be left where they would not have stolen
 dekhie ye chote bachche rahete he
 Those who have children, sell them to those children or give them on contract
 bacchon kaa sauda lakhon rupee main hota he yaa phir chori ke maal me aadha hissaa inaki keemat hoti he
 Then they make them do anything
 jahaan bhi bachche pakade jate hai to kharidaar yaa thekedaat bataate hai ki bachche usee ke hai
 With them, older children go, who search where marriages are happening
 kahaan kya ho rahaa he
 In the same gatup, children are prepared and sent there
 ek-ek karke baat karenge to shaayad aapako zyaada aasaan tareeke se is syndicate kii karatootein samaj aaengin
 There are many cases registered in Delhi NCR
 Two months ago, five accused were charged by Delhi Police
 inhen se poochtacha main ye khulaasa hua ki empi ke rajgad ke gulkhedi gaanv se oparate hone vaala ye gang darasal ol india level kaa he
 And their activity is so fast that within few months this gang carried out several dozen incidents in NCR
 15 vaaradaaten to aisi hai jinaki exiaar darj hai
 It is natural to raise the question that no matter how vicious the gang is
 magar bacchon par aitbaar kaise kiya ja saktaa he
 How can a gang thrive on just this
 yakeenan hairaani hoti he
 But this is the way the gang works
 wo usase bhi ajeeb he
 No child is included in the gang
 balki bhartee kaa yahaan baqayada ek system he
 It is in writing that the children of the contractgang select only the fast-paced children
 inke maa-baap se inhen baqayada contract par liya jaataa he yaa phir kharid liya jaataa he
 After this, these children are given training in Gulkhedi village
 phir training puri hone par bade shaharon main partiyon-shaadiyon main inase chori karai jaati he
 We have told you about that written contract
 jo is gang ke log bacchon ke maa-baap se karte hai
 If you take a cursory view on this contract, it says that one party is giving the other party to their 12-year-old son as an advance for one year only on contract
 taaki uskaa betaa shaadi-vivaah kii partiyon main bheed ke bich se keemtee chizein uda saken or chori ke in saamaanon kaa baraabar-baraabar bantwaaraa hoga
 The police is unable to reach the real parents of the children, their parents themselves are afraid of getting caught
 unhen lagata he ki ve funs jaaegein
 After contracting the child, the gang becomes responsible
 pakade jane par police asli maa baap kaa pataa nahin laga paati yaa veriphai nahin kar paati
 Police do not know whose children they actually belong to
 jab police gaanv main jaati he to vahaan koi bhi gaavan kii voter list lekar khadaa ho jaataa he ki yahaan kaa baccha he yaa vahaan kaa
 But these people get caught in the technology of law
 is kaam ko anjaam to bade bhi de sakate hai lekin bachche ke liye raahat ye he ki vah jaldi hi chhot jate hai
 Bail is also granted early
 bacchon se chori karaane ke phydein shaatiron ko bacchon se chori karaane main kai phaayde hote hai
 So just keep counting the benefits that this gang can give to young children
 bacchon ke liye kisi bhi party main ghusna aasaan hota he
 They join women easily
 bacchon ke liye chori karnaa bhi aasaan hota he
 No one suspects children
 pakade jane par bachche pitane se batch jate hai
 The law of child criminals is also very liberal
 bachche jail ke bajaae remand home main bheje jate hai
 It is difficult to catch if you come out of the act, because this work is done on a very large scale and systematically
 lihaaza gang bhi phulpruf tareeke se kaam karata he
 Children are prepared before being sent to a wedding or party for theft
 unhen baqayada mahange kapade pahanaae jate hai
 So that there is no scope of doubt
 maukey par gang kii car ready condishan main rahati hai taaki vaardaat hote hi rafuchakkar hua ja sake or bachche agar pakad main aa bhi jate hai to unhen chhudwane ke liye har shahar main inke vakil bhi hote hai
 But once they get out of the act, then it is really impossible to get hold of them
 gulkhedi gaanv main naakaam ho jaataa he kanoonpulice sab jaanati he ki ye bachche kahaan se aae hai
 Who has trained them? or gang koun chalaa rahaa he
 But still the police go to Gulkhedi and become helpless
 darasal, thane ke aankade bataate hai ki kareeb 5 darjan warrent yahaan maheenon se pade hue hai, jinaki taamil tak nahin hui or desh kii shaayad hi kisi soobe kii police ho jo yahaan aropiyon ko pakadaney ke liye na ai ho magar jitani garmjoshi se wo yahaan aati he
 Equally disappointed, she returns empty-handed
 pataa nahin aisa kya ho jaataa he ki gulkhedi kii choukhat par kadam rakhane ke baad adalati farmaan naakaam or kanoon bebas hokar rah jaataa he
 It is openly in the village that millions of gamblers, where the police could not enter, it was obviously very difficult for us to enter there
 khufia camere ke saath hi sahi magar aaj tak ne ye koshish kii
 Our team wanted to know what is it in this village that the police comes here and becomes helpless
 
 We had no choice but to talk to people and find out the reason
 magar hamaare khufia camere main ham kisi kii baatcheet ricard kar pate
 Before that, strange pictures started to be recorded
 gali-gali main jue ke adde chal rahe the
 Look wherever there were pieces of cards
 jeet ke liye hazaron lakhon ke nae noton se baazi lag rahi thi
 The entire village was made openly
 saikadon kii taadaad main log khadey hokar niyam-kanoon ko beasar karne vaala khulla khel rahe the
 The villagers beat the police and tried to know the villagers, ask the truth, it was bad to know the situation
 gaanv ke dev narayan naam ke ek shaks ne bataaya 'police kya kar legi
 The police do not say anything
 police ke latt padegein
 What will the police do? police ko kai baar maar kar bhagaaya he
 Police does not come here, there is no threat of police-police here
 kaai baar latt pade he kaai baar thoke hai
 Nobody is afraid here
 ' jab unase poocha gaya ki ye gaiyrkanoonee kaam he to unka jawaab tha ki gaiyrkanoonee he to koun dekh rahaa he
 What will anyone do? ajeeb gaanv he ye
 What is there in India, but its law does not work here
 agar kanoon kii yahaan jagah nahin to phir yahaan chalati kiski he
 The local police takes the money recorded in the camera till today, they cannot speak but can tell you
 to suniye puure desh kii police ke liye sirdard bani empi ke is gaanv main chalati kiski he
 The SHO of the police station says, 'yes, what to do, what not to do, in most cases, the police takes money and took the money and went away
 mujhe aaye hue aath nau maheene ho gaye hai maine to dekha nahin police ne kisi kii gheraabandi kii ho or kisi ko pakad kar le gai ho
 'outsiders come and play, gamble and drink alcohol, even if the gambling gates are running, it is still a privilege
 magar yahaan to duniya ke har bure kaam kanoon kii kitabon ko chidhaa rahe hai
 On one side, this village is the base of the gamblers and on the other hand, the most favorite place of the taverns
 avaidh sharaab kii dukaanon par yahaan mahangi se mahangi sharaab bhi aadhe daam par mil jaati he
 Apart from this, there is a lot of arrangement here too
 gaanv main aapako katai aisa lagegaa nahin ki aap ek aise desh main gum rahe hai jahaan khule main sharaab or jua pratibandhit he
 We tried to talk to the former head of the village on this issue
 to unki daleel to or hi ajeeb thi
 He told 'he does not play himself
 aadhiktar log khujner, bod or pachor ke aate hai
 These are outsiders, all come from outside cities
 yahaan koi jua satta nahin kheltaa he
 Here these people do not play themselves
 khud paisa nahi kharchate ye khud daaru nahin pite
 If liquor is also sold here, then liquor is not drunk
 'aparaadhiyon kaa liye jananath he ye gaanvjurm yahaan khule main pasarataa he
 The accused are careless
 kehete hai ki kisi kii majaal nahin he, jo in par nakel kas sake
 You have already seen the condition of the police

 44 minutesrtificate: uretimga: 2
 5 Barefoot to Goa through all the film festivals is now set to release, and is a drama based on family relationships
 daadi, pote, potee, ladkaa or bahu iske mukhya paatr hai, aaiye jaan lete hai ki aakhir kahani kya he
 Shraddha Kapoor will go to Shillong to prepare for Rock On-2: An aged woman (farooq Zafar) who is a grandmother and also a mother, lives alone in her home in Goa and her son lives in Mumbai with his wife and children
 lives
 bas maa kii mamata he jo baar baar use chitthee likhavane par majaboor karti he or hameshaa haath ke banaae hue besan ke laddu or khat mumbai courier kar detii he
 But even the daughter-in-law (purva Parag) does not allow that letter or laddu to reach her husband or children
 or kinhi kaarnon se jab bacchon ko apni daadi maa ke bare main khabar milti he to donon bachche diya (sara nahar) or prakhar (prakhar morchale) ghar main bina bataae apni daadi se milane ke liye nikal padate hai, or aakhirkaar goa pahunch jate hai, ab kya wo donon apni daadi ko ghar waapas laa pate hai, yahi he kahani 'bemfoot tu goa' kii

 The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered a fresh probe into allegations of detention of minors by security forces following the decision of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court's four-member Juvenile Justice Committee to repeal several provisions of Article 370 in the state
 nyaayamurti en ve raman, nyaayamurti aar subhash reddy or nyaayamurti bi aar gawai kii teen sadasyeey peeth ne kishor nyaay samiti se kaha ki vah apni report yathashighra pesh kare
 The bench has also listed the matter for hearing on December 3
 peeth ne kaha ki in aaropon kii naye sire se jaanch kii aavashyaktaa he kyonki samiti kii pehle kii report samayabhaav kii vajah se sheersh adaalat ke aadesh ke anuroop nahin thi
 The apex court was hearing a plea raising the issue of illegal detention of minors in the Kashmir Valley
 bal adhikaar kaaryakartaaon or jammu kashmir prashasan ke vakeelon kii daleelein sunne ke baad peeth ne kaha ki samiti ko saunpa gaya kaam samayabhaav kii vajah se sheersh adaalat ke aadesh kii bhaavana ke anuroop nahin kiya gaya
 The bench said that the September 20 order of the apex court reached the committee on September 23 and two days later the Director General of Jammu and Kashmir Police denied the claims and allegations made in the media and the petition on September 25
 samiti kii report main atirikt police mahanideshak ke nishkarsh bhi shaamil the jisame kashmir me gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se kishoron ko hiraasat main rakhane ke aaropon se inkaar kiya gaya tha
 The committee told the apex court that 144 juveniles were taken into custody in the state after the Center repealed the provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution, but 142 of them were released later
 samiti ne apni report main kaha tha ki shesh do naaballigon ko kishor sudhaar grih main bhej diya gaya tha
 When the matter came up for hearing on October 1, senior advocate Hujefa Ahmadi on behalf of child rights activists Inakshi Ganguly and Shanta Sinha had said that they would like to file their reply on this report
 ahmadi mangalvaar ko jab apni daleelein pesh kar rahe the to isi dauraan peeth ne samiti ke sadasyon ke bare main prayukt aapattijanak bhashaa kii ore unka dhyaan aakarshith kiya or kaha ki inhen waapas lenaa hoga
 Ahmadi agreed with this suggestion and said that he would withdraw these by filing an affidavit
 peeth ne kaha ki chaar sadasyeey samiti ke sadsy nyaayadhish hai or unke bare main aise shabdon kaa istemaal sweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The bench said that the committee has its limitations and perhaps the members were also short of time
 peeth ne varisht adhivaktaa ko yaad dilaayaa ki jab pehali baar yah maamla sunwaayee ke liye aayaa tha to yachikakartaon ne daawa kiya tha ki ucch nyaayalay main nyaay ke liye nahin pahunchaa ja saktaa
 On this, the Chief Justice sought a report from the High Court
 is maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan maujuud atarni general ke ke venugopal se peeth ne kishor nyaay samiti kii report ke bare main poocha
 Venugopal said that the Center is also a respondent in this case along with the Jammu and Kashmir administration and its approach is administration-oriented
 salisitor general tushaar mehta ne maamle kii sunwaayee sthagit karne kaa anurodh kiya lekin peeth ne kaha ki is tarah ke mahatvapurn maamle main vilamb nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Mehta said that the petitioners were abusing the legal process and they should have filed the petition in the High Court instead of the apex court
 unhone kaha ki yachikakartaon ne sheersh adaalat main pehle yah jhootha daawa kiya tha ki ucch nyaayalay kaam nahin kar rahaa he
 He said that this petition should not be kept pending as the High Court is available for relief and the Juvenile Justice Committee is working

 tiimon ne apane khilaadiyon ke liye khel or anushaasan se sambandhit kai tarah ke niyam banaae hai, jo kaaphi had tak milte-julate hai
 But during this grand event, teams and players are facing different rules regarding physical relations
 masalan, costarika ke khilaadi duusare daur se pehle apni patniyon, premicaon yaa anya kisi ke saath hambistar nahin ho sakate
 Brazilian players are allowed to get into bed with their wives or girlfriends, but they have been told to be careful about physical damage
 nigeria ke khilaadi vishwa cap ke dauraan sirf apni patniyon ke saath hambistar ho sakate hai
 Russia, Mexico and Bosnia and Herzegovina have banned sex for their players during the World Cup
 vishwa cap main hissaa le rahi koi bhi team haalanki aadhikarik taur par niyamon ke daayre main nahin bandhi he
 Despite this, every team has set a taboo area for themselves
 kochon ko lagata he ki khilaadi sex se adhik thak jaaenge, to unhone apane str par unhen is thakaan se bachaane ke liye nae niyam bana die
 According to the Quartz website, Germany, Spain, the United States, Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Uruguay and England, however, have not imposed any specific restrictions or restrictions on the sex of the players
 kochon kaa maananaa he ki agar khilaadi maidan main apni kshamta ke saath nyaay kar rahe hai to phir unhen is swaabhaavik kriya se roka nahin janaa chahie
 Russia, Chile, Mexico and Bosnian teams, however, have banned sex altogether
 website ke mutabik in tiimon ke kochon kaa maananaa he ki unke khilaadi apni sex se judi sari 'frustation' maidan main utaaren, kyonki ve isi kaam ke liye yahaan aae hai
 Mexico's coach Miguel Herrera said, "the world will not go backwards by not having physical relations for 40 days
" agar ek khilaadi ek maheene yaa phir 20 dinon tak shaareerik sambandh banaae bina nahin rah saktaa to vah peshewar kahalaane ke laayak nahin
 'for teams like Brazil, Costa Rica, France, Nigeria, however, the matter is complicated
 brazil ke coach louis philip scolari ko thodaa bahut sex se parhez nahin lekin vah nahin chaahate ki khilaadi shaareerik sambandh banane kii prakriya main khud ko nuksaan pahunchaaen
 Scolari is aware that his team's star player Ronaldinho was roped in by Ghost of Sex and PS2 in 2006 and that is why his team had to look out of the quarter-finals
 francisi team ke liye sex par pabandi nahin, lekin uske khilaadi puri raat isamen mashgool nahin rah sakate
 Team doctors agree that sex is good for players, but it is harmful to stay up all night
 nigerian team ke khilaadi apni patniyon ke saath hambistar ho sakate hai, lekin premicaon ke saath nahin
 For Costa Rica players, sex is a prize for the second round
 agar ve duusare daur main pahunche to unhen isaki khuli chhot hogi
 American and Australian teams claim that they have many other important issues besides thinking about the sex life of the players
 english team par kisi tarah kaa pratibandh nahin
 Imam is back! Yes, Imam, who ruled the hearts of the audience with his camel antics in Bigg Boss Season 6, has once again revived his old image in Big Boss 9

 In a way, the falling level of the show has proved very beneficial for Imam Sidiki

 chhattisgarh kii dharti par naksalwad or aatankwaad ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 Result of renunciation of the formation of the state, Singh said on the occasion of the inauguration of the state festival on Chhattisgarh State Foundation Day that the formation of Chhattisgarh state is the result of sacrifice and sacrifices of the people
 rajya ko vikaas ke path par aage badhaane ke liye sabhi ko ek saath milakar prayaas karnaa hoga

 The NGT has also asked the Delhi government that the masks which are being sold at present are also working in such pollution or not

 On the third day of the Galle Test match, hosts Sri Lanka were in danger of losing the innings
 lekin chandimal kii centuri ne srilanka ko match main vaapasi dilaa di he
 Apart from the Sri Lankan batsmen, the umpires are also largely responsible for Team India's condition
 match ke tisare din 18 gendon ke andar ampire ne teen vivaadaaspad faisle die
 With these decisions, the entire team India was seen as brilliant
 captain viraat kohli samet sabhi khilaadi niraash or khafa najar aae
 The first disputed decision was throwing r Ashwin over the 27th
 25wein over main anjalo maithyuj ko pavilion kaa rasta dikhaane vaale aswin kii gend par chandimal ne sweep shot khelaa
 Before the catch at short leg, the ball hit the paw of Chandimus with the bat
 riple main saaf najar aa rahaa tha ki gend balle se lagi thi lekin ampire ne apni ungali nahin uthaai or chandimal ko bada jeevandaan mila
 Second disputed decision: In the next over, Amit Mishra bowled a leg-break ball, after Lahiru Thirimne took the inside edge of the bat, the ball went to the silly point fielder but once again the umpire turned down the appeal
 teesraa vivaadit faislalunch se pehle ek baar phir chandimal bhaagyashaalee rahe jab drive karne ke chakkar main gend sili point par khadey fielder ke pair par lagakar hawa main uchhali or gendbaaj ne kaich lapka
 The decision also went to the third umpire, but despite the clear replay, the decision went in favor of the batsman

 The Trinamool Congress chief alleged that the Prime Minister has sent a letter to every house to tell him about the scheme, which has his photo and lotus symbol
 aisa karke unhone swasthya yojana kaa ‘raajnneetikaran' kiya he
 Banerjee said that the Center is 'using' post offices to send these letters
 unhone yahaan ek kaarykram main kaha, ‘‘aap (narendra modi) rajya ke har ghar main apni tasveeron ko lagaakar patr bhej rahe hai or yojana kaa shrey lene ke liye bade-bade vaayade kar rahe he

 The good thing about the past is that it gives an opportunity to assess the past
 ab saal 2011 itihaas ke pannon main samaa rahaa he, aise main saal kii charchit hastiyon main jharkhand ke mukhyamantri arjuna munda kaa zikr lajimi he
 He has been trying to materialize every important idea for Jharkhand throughout the year
 sitambar, 2010 main mukhyamantri kii kursi sanbhaalane ke baad se hi munda kuch karne ke jazbe se las rahe hai
 At that time, no one could have guessed that Jharkhand, which had been synonymous with misrule in the past, would emerge as a unique example of good governance initiatives in the year under his leadership
 yah saal munda kii uplabdhiyon kii kahani he
 On 30 August, Jharkhand became the first state in the country to enact a law to provide public services through electronic means
 agar aap jharkhand main hai to aay, jati or awaas pramaan-patr jaisi saarvajanik sevaayen internet ke jariye aap tak pahunch sakati hai
 Following in the footsteps of Jharkhand, 'bade Bhai' Bihar also took steps to provide public services through electronic means from 1st December
 jharkhand desh kaa chauthaa aisa rajya ban gaya he, jahaan 'seva kaa adhikaar' kanoon lagu he
 Under this, government officials are obliged to provide public services within a given time frame
 saal bhar ve lakshya ke liye patibaddh shaks ke rup main dikhe
 Munda has been proactive in establishing an inspiring and reliable administration in the state, ranging from visiting remote areas to take stock of roads, to setting up a call center for direct contact with the public
 ve aisi shakhsiyat ke rup main ubhare hai jo naaron kii bajaae kaam main yakeen rakhata he
 He also succeeded in his goal because he kept up the tendency to learn
 rajya ke ek varisht iees adhikari kehete hai, ''ve hamaare prastaavon par gaur farmaate hai
 They discuss development goals through charts and presentations and are keen to learn continuously in order to better governance
 ''har tarah kii uthal-puthal ke baavjood sakaaratmak nattejey dene kii unki pratibha, unhen apane samakaleen netaaon se alag banaati he
 Ever since Jharkhand came into existence on November 15, 2000, many governments in this state have been in crisis
 11 saal main rajya ne raashtrapati shashan ke do daur ke alaava aath sarkarein dekhi hai
 All these governments kept swinging under the threat of withdrawal of support from allied parties with vested interests
 munda sarkaar bhi iskaa apwaad nahin he
 Worse, the Munda government has the support of legislators who are willing to go to any lengths for their vested interests and remain restless for 'creamy' positions
 munda unhen khush karne main yakeen nahin karte
 Even in such odd circumstances, Munda has taken many such steps which have increased her stature
 unke kai faisle to behad jokhim bhare or sarkaar ko asthir karne vaale ho sakate the
 The victory of the ruling coalition in the Mandu by-election is the biggest proof of Munda's leadership skills
 unhone is upachunaav main bhaajapa pratyaashee nahin utaara
 Convinced his colleague AJSU to do the same
 phir apane sabase bharosemand or ek dashak puraane sahyogi janata dal (united) kii keemat par jhamumo ke pratyaashee kaa samarthan karne kaa faisla kiya
 This decision proved to be true when the JD (U) candidate's bail was forfeited and the JMM candidate won
 haalanki, sab kuch unke manamafik nahin hua
 The bjp's defeat in the by-election to the Jamshedpur parliamentary seat vacated by him after becoming the chief minister was his biggest setback
 jaise-jaise 2011 aage badhata gaya, munda aisi shakhsiyat ke rup me ubhare jiskaa virdohi bhi sammaan karte hai
 Pradeep Balmuchu, president of the Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee, says, "they have the ability to manage all kinds of people
" par vipareet vichaardhaaraon vaale log vyaktigat hit saadhane ke liye unki sarkaar chalaa rahe hai
 He gave a good example of the balance of power and gave momentum to the coalition government
 jad (you) ke 5 mantriyon ke dabaav main 2003 main istipha dene ko majaboor babulal marandi kii jagah pad sanbhaalane vaale munda aaj rajya main bhaajapa kaa sabase bharosemand cheharaa hai
 This is his third term as Chief Minister
 ve ek baar bhi paanch saal tak pad kaa swaad nahin chakh sake hai
 Munda's standing in the upheaval politics of Jharkhand is also an achievement
 star plus ke sho 'ye he mohabbatein' main in dinon hivoltage drama dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 At the same time, Karan Patel, who plays the lead actor of the show Raman Bhalla, is leaving the show
 reports ke mutabik, actor chaitanya choudhary karan patel ko riples karenge
 But do you know how Chaitanya will take over Karan Patel's character
 times of india kii khabar ke mutabik, sho main raman chattan se gir jayega
 Actually, there is a fight between Raman and Arijit, after which Raman will fall from the rock, but he will not die
 iske baad raman kii plastic surgery karai jaaegi
 The face that will be revealed after plastic surgery will be that of Chaitanya Chaudhary
 is tarah se chaitanya choudhary ko introdeus kiya jayega
 Explain that Karan Patel had said on leaving the show, 'all good things come to an end
 ye he mohabbatein sho hameshaa mere dil ke kareeb rahegaa or mujhe raman bhalla banane ke liye main ekta kapur kaa shukraguzaar hum
 Karan will be seen in the reality show Khatron Ke Khiladi
 khataron ke khilaadi ke liye karan ne apni fitness par kaam karnaa bhi shuru kar diya he
 There are also reports that Karan can become a part of Yeh Hai Mohabbatein again after the end of the show
 haalanki, abhi tak kuch bhi oficial nahin hua he
 Talking about the ongoing plot in the show, let us tell that Arijit has kidnapped Ishita and Raman Bhalla
 vahiin gharavaalon ko gumraah karne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Everyone feels that Ishita has gone to find Raman, but no one knows that Arijit has kidnapped Ishita too

 Mishra has said that the Election Commission has accepted the memorandum given by various parties, especially Congress, BJP, SP and Rashtriya Lok Dal, to cover the statues and statues of elephants is not justified, because this order is unilateral

 com / vvwxhlmw1r arvind kejarivalkenitin gadakriper kisaanon kii jameen hadapney kaa aarope lagane ke kuch hi der baad palatwaar karte hue bijepi netaaon ne do press conference kar ise sire se khaarij karte hue kejariwal or india against karpshan kii vishwasaneeyata ko hi kathghare main khadaa kiya he
 BJP national president Nitin Gadkari said that dragging me into the scam is absolutely unfortunate
 unhone kaha ki jis jameen kii baad ho rahi he use cheritable trust ko 11 saal pehle lij par diya gaya tha
 Describing himself as unfortunate to be dragged into the scam, he said, 'I am silent on the scam, it is not so
 maine 10 hajaar gramin yuvakon ko rojgaar dene kaa kaam kiya he
 i have been constantly struggling for irrigation
 vidarbha kii sinchai samasya ke liye ladata rahaa hum
 All these allegations are being leveled against me by political selfishness
 ’sushamaa ne bhi kiya kejariwal par praharisake kuch der baad hi bijepi kii netaa vipaksh sushamaa swaraj or arun jetali press se mukhaatib hue
 Sushma Swaraj dismissed Arvind Kejriwal's allegations outright
 unhone kaha, ‘pichley kai dinon se media main ek maahaul banaaya ja rahaa tha ki bahut jaldi bijepi ke khilaaf koi bada khulaasa kiya jayega or is khulaase ke liye kai tithiyaan mukarrar kii gai
 The news was being served like a bomb that Kejriwal would act against a BJP leader and our suspicion came true that even after much effort, not a single allegation was made towards BJP
 jitani partiyon ke naam unhen yaad the un sab ke naam unhone le daale
 Put everyone in the dock
 sirf unhone khud ke liye vot nahin maanga
 Commenting on Nitin Gadkari's conversation with Anjali Damania, he said that Anjali has never spoken to Nitin Gadkari
 gauratlab he ki india against karpshan ne yah khulaasa kiya he ki jo jameen nitin gadakari ko di gai wo kisaanon kii khet thi jo unase adhigrahit kii gai thi
 Sushma Swaraj gave the answer to the allegations
 Sushma Swaraj said that the allegations of IAC are wrong as it was a barren land
 vahaan nitin gadakari ne ganna kaa paudha ugaaya jise kisaanon ko saste daamon par diya gaya
 Sushma said, 'nitin ji is cultivating the land where sugarcane is grown
 vahaan ganna kii saowling uga kar nitin ji maatr 5 rupee main kisaanon ko de rahe hai jabaki uskaa bazaar mulya 13 rupee he
 After this, Sushma Swaraj responded to other allegations of the IAC accusing Gadkari of diverting the water of the dam towards Nitin Gadkari's land
 sushamaa ne kaha, ‘wo jameen 1983-84 main adhigrahan kii gai thi
 a dam was built over it in 1996
 IAC kaa aarope ki usapar kisaan kheti kar rahe the bilkul niraadhaar he
 Even the farmers there have been compensated
 vahaan ek banjar jameen thi kheti nahin ho rahi thi
 'sushma said,' On the matter of getting water from the dam to Nitinji's plant, we say that only 0 of the dam
 85 fisadi pani hi mila he
 Therefore, questions have started arising out of this disclosure by Kejriwal himself
 isse unki vishwasaneeyata par hi prashn chinh lagata he
 Jaitley questioned the iac's credibility
arun Jaitley while addressing reporters said that Kejriwal could not prove corruption because Gadkari has done all the work as per the rules
 unhone kaha, ‘aaj kii press conferes mukhyatah chunavi stant tha
 This was a failed attempt to uncover corruption completely
 bhrashtachar ke maamle main congress ke saath bijepi ko khadaa karnaa puri tarah se niraadhaar he
 Jaitley questioned the credibility of the IAC, saying, "when an organization calls itself a crusader, its credibility itself is very important
 aaj india against karpshan ne civil socity vaali apni vishwasaneeyata ko khatm kar diya he
 Today he did the work of 'hit man' who attacks anyone
 ’jetali ne bataaya, ‘nitin ji ke jameen par sampling lagaae hai
 This land has been leased for 11 years
 isamen koi raajnneetik shadyantr kaa kone dhundhna galat he
 These allegations are completely rejected by the Bharatiya Janata Party
 ’jetali ne kaha, ‘unka ye aarope ki vahaan kisaan kheti kar rahe the yah saraasar galat he
 Some part of the land is barren
 vahaan kheti band he
 For the betterment of the farmers, if the government gives any land to the power plant, then there is nothing wrong or illegal in this
 desh kii sabhi jaminen jahaan aaj koi imaarat khadi he vahaan kabhi na kabhi kheti hoti thi
 Overall, the BJP has reposed full confidence in its national president and dismissed Kejriwal's allegations outright

 There was a heated debate in the Rajya Sabha on Friday during the discussion on the UAPA bill
 vipaksh kii ore se bill ke sanshodhano par kai tarah ke sawaal khadey kiye gaye, lekin grih mantri amit shah ne unke tarkon kaa jawaab bhi diya
 Meanwhile, while replying to the Congress question, Amit Shah said that if he agrees to the opposition, then even Hafiz Saeed and Dawood Ibrahim will not be declared as terrorists
 darasal, jab amit shah kaa jawaab sadan main khatm hua to congress kii ore se purv vitt mantri pi
 Chidambaram posed some counter questions
 chidambaram ne kaha ki main congress kii sthiti ko spasht kar dena chahta hum ki ham bill ke virodh main nahin hai, sirf kuch sawaalon ke jawaab chaahate hai
 Former Finance Minister P
 chidambaram kaa sawaal:ham cloj 5,6 ke bare main safai chaahate hai
 The government should make it clear that if you declare a person as a terrorist, then what stage will that be, when you say that he is a terrorist? Will he be declared a terrorist without questioning? Answer by Home Minister Amit Shah: Some terrorists often flee abroad, it will be difficult to declare them terrorists by questioning them
 agar aisa hua to ham hafiz said or daaud ibrahim ko bhi aatanki ghoshit nahin kar paaenge, aisa UN kar legaa lekin ham nahin kar paaenge
 That is why it has to be done
 saath hi, amit shah ne kaha ki aam taur par jab tak vyakti poochtacha ke liye uplabdh he to saboot-poochtacha ke baad hi use aatanki ghoshit kiya jayega
 But if he is not available and he does not want to help in the questioning, then he will have to be declared a terrorist
 pi
 Apart from Chidambaram, Anand Sharma from Congress also questioned Amit Shah
 anand sharma ne poocha ki sarkaar bataae ki kya aise maamalon main abhiyojan paksh ko jaanch se alag rakhaa jayega?is par amit shah ne jawaab diya ki bill ke andar hamane NIA ke andar apil kaa provijan spasht kiya he
 In such a situation, the opinion of the IO, IG will be taken, after that the opinion of the Law Officer will also be taken and after this the Law Officer of the Government of India will give its opinion on it
 amit shah ne kaha ki isamen sarkaar kaa koi role nahin rahegaa
 Being a writer is not easy, but easy
 himmat,jigra honachahie
 a little writing should also come
 jo jigra chahie na wo lekhak banane ko nahin ye swikaarne ko ki lo ji ham to lekhak nikal gaye hen hen hen!jigra se zyada majboot peeth or moti cham chahie hoti he jab ghar waalon ko pataa chale ki ladkaa chakri karne kii bajaay kalam thaamne ja rahaa he
 Janam Bhar is going to write the name in Baniya's lending account
 takaadedaaron ko pili chitthee bhej rahaa he to majboot peeth badi kaam aati he
 After knowing the relationship states of girls and the career decision of boys, there is often a reaction in the homes either by dropping food or Amma's blood pressure ghat
 ghar vaale chaahate hai ladkaa doctor bane
 Became Kallattar
 par ladkaa jis shaam lekhak ho padane kaa elaan karata he
 That evening, he himself wants only two things
 ghar main phenkakar maari ja sakane vaali chijen najar na aaen or padosiyon ko tivi kii aawaaj ke saamne kuch or sunai na de paae
 Who would say that who would want to start his writing career with an open head and ridicule of neighbors? Every writer is a rebel
 pehla vidroh wo ghar par karata he
 Turns out that in the marriage of the most beautiful girl of the locality, his rebellion kills Kulanche, then Kulanche keeps on killing, as long as the last lender in the world remains
 kadaki lekhakon kii pahchaan he, anti main maal ho to duniya bhalee lagati he
 The world is not good for writing
 jaise camel keechad main khilata he lekhak kadaki main palata he
 Why do writers remember the world? There are those who die by borrowing, which cannot be sought back
 lekhak paropkaaree hote hai jindagi bhar sampadakon par upkaar karte hai marakar un tamaam par jinase ab wo or udhaar na le paaenge
 Some writers die quickly just because there is not much worldly debt
 ham lekhakon ke rini hote hai
 We have a responsibility towards writers
 lekhakon ke liye kuch karnaa chahen to jite-ji unhen udhaar dene se manaa na kare or marane par vasuuli ko na jaaen
 Writers also have a category
 category ke hisaab se karm bante hote hai
 The big writer photographs, the younger writer writes
 chota lekhak or likhata he bada lekhak or photo khinchaata he
 It is not that the big writer just photographs
 bada lekhak chintaa vyakt karata he
 Big people have big concerns
 sahitya main nae log aa nahin rahe
 Those who are coming are not there
 log chapana jaldi chaahate hai
 It seems pointless to publish a big writer because he is printing
 chote lekhak kochapana hekhyonki wo chap nahin rahaa
 The concern of a small writer is also small
 chhapane kii pehali shart he photo
 Everyone is a writer
 How will there be photo recognition? Photos of writers are also amazing
 chehre par bhav hi nahin hote
 One should not know from the appearance
 aadmi ke andar chal kya rahaa he?shakl par hi sab dikh gaya to aglaa padhegaa kya khaak! munshi premchand kii photo dekhi he aapane
 One with a mustache
 wo blike and white vaali
 Looked like a writer
 photo blike and white ho to aadmi bada lekhak lagane lagata he
 Some writers are such that in the age of digital, photographs are black and white and the prints are sent in a cup of tea and sent
 kehete hai photo puraani lage to aglaa varisht lekhak samajhataa he
 Writers' glasses also take them to a different level
 yashpal chashme se dekhte the
 Bhagavaticharan Varma from above in glasses
 photo dekhie to lagata he puch rahe hai, “kaho aaj idhar kaise?”so lekhak hone ko ek chashma bhi chahie
 Have you ever seen a writer apply contact lenses? Writing is a boon, then glasses are a sign of a boon
 kabhi apana likhaa pard ankhen phod lene kaa man kare to pehle chashma phute
 So have a strong back
 moti chamadi
 a photo with a faceless face
 dher sa udhaar
 a glasses
 bas insaan
 One can become a writer from a human being
 haa thodaa-bahut likhnaa agar

 And these children also used to share their parents' hands with wages
 magar ab ye bachche reporter he

 maheene bhar kii mehnat ke baad akhbaar kii 8000 pratiyaan chhaapi jaati hai, jo kidillike kai alag-alag ilaakon main banti jaati hai
 These children leave their groups to distribute their newspapers
 kabhi kisi hotel main to kabhi kisi park main
 If no one knows about this newspaper, then these children themselves tell about their newspaper
 agar koi nahin khareednaa chahta to ye bachche unhen muft main bhi apana akhbaar de dete he
 Thinking that maybe he will buy it sometime
 or aise hi bachche din raat mehnat kar apane akhbaar main bacchon par ho rahe jurm ko chhapate he
 Which also has a lot of effect
 vaise to is akhbaar ko puri tarah bachche hi chalaate hai, magar is akhbaar ko chhapane ke liye chetana naam kaa enjio inaki madad karata he
 10 thousand children connected Today, the name of the child network is spread in four states of the country
 madhya pradesh, bihar, upi or haryana main aaj balakanama se 10,000 bachche jude hue hai
 Children who cannot write tell their news
 unhen batooni reporter kehete hai
 There is also an editor to write the news, who writes the news on the computer
 aaj bhale hi in bacchon keekhbarko log jaanate nahin hai, magar ye bachche puri lagan or mehnat ke saath kaam karte hai or bacchon par ho rahe jurm ko apane is akhbaar main chhapate hai
