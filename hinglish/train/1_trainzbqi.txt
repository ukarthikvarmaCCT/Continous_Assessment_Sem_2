 During the debate on election reforms in Rajya Sabha, BJP General Secretary and Rajya Sabha member Bhupendra Yadav said that there should be only one election in the country
 chaahe vah loksabhaa ke chunaav hon yaa vidhansabha ke
 Apart from this, Bhupendra Yadav said that panchayat elections should also be held along with these two elections
 unhone kaha ki isse chunaavon main hone vaale kharche main bhi kami aegi
 Bhupendra Yadav said that if there will be one country-one election, then it can also be a waste of time
 sabhi raajnneetik partiyon ko isamen ek saath milakar aage badhanaa chahie
 An opinion should be formed
 ek matadaata suchi honi chahie
 So that after opening the website the voter can know where to cast his vote
 usko jaankaree rahe, lekin ab loksabhaa ke chunaavon main alag matadaata suchi hoti he
 Assembly elections have separate voter lists
 kai baar dekhne main aata he ki unke vot cat jate hai
 All political parties should move forward with one vote
 'bhupendra yadav kaa kahana he ki hamaare desh kii janata loktantr main bahut hi samajhadaar ho chuki he
 The cost of political parties will also be reduced after one country-one election
 iske alaava vidhansabha-loksabhaa kaa ek saath chunaav hone se aasaani bhi hoti he
 The biggest topic in the election is expenses
 sabhi partiyon ko is vishay main aage bad kar aana chahie
 Assembly, Lok Sabha, Panchayat elections will be held simultaneously, then the expenses are divided among the candidates
 ham apane raajnneetik vichaaron ko lekar janata tak pahunchnaa chaahate hai sabhi raajnneetik dalon ke kharch main kami aegi
 There should be only one voter list in a country - Bhupendra Yadav on the questions raised on evms says that there is no party whose government has not been formed by evms in the last 20 years? The apprehension being expressed about evms is not good
 ham loktantr ko peeche le jane ke liye aisa nahin kar sakate
 The political parties that have raised questions on evms have also become a government with the help of evms
 raajnneeti main paisa paardarshita ke saath aana chahie
 We should think about ending illegal funding, black money
 raajnneetik dalon ko kaise janata ke anuroop banaaen? yah vishay aisa he jo ki bahut jaruri he
 Speaking further, Bhupendra Yadav said that the elections held in the country are held as a festival
 chunaav prakriya main zyada se zyada log kaise vot den, yah hamako sochna chahie
 Even if we have to amend the constitution, there should be only one voter list in a country
 is vyavastha ko lagu karne ke liye sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko ek saath aana chahie

 Khan got 176 votes in yesterday's election, while Shahbaz Sharif received 96 votes
 bataa den ki aam chunaavon main 116 siton ke saath pitiai sabase bade dal ke rup main ubhari
 Later, with 9 independents joining Khan's party, their strength rose to 125

 The Transporters Association says that they will not go on strike, but if the problem is not resolved, they will not be able to drive the truck
 darasal, sarkaar ne puraane 500 or 1000 ke noto ko 14 november tak kaa hi samay diya he, jisamen petrol panpon par puraane noton ko chalaa sakate hai, lekin agar 14 november ke baad bhi isamen relif nahin diya gaya, to phir guds trek nahin chal paaenge
 If this happens, there may be a shortage of everyday foods in many states including Delhi
 guds trek transporter association rajendra kapur kaa kahana he ki chote transporteron ko ek trek chalaane ke liye kareeb ek trek par kareeb7000 se 8000 rupekharch hote hai
 At the same time, a truck in a long distance costs around 50,000 rupees
 unhone bataaya ki har transporter ko 10 trek chalaane ke liye kareeb teen lakh rupee kii rojaanaa jarurat hogi, jabaki sarkaar kii taraf se sirf 10,000 rupee hi nikaalane ke nirdesh die hai
 In such a situation, if the transporters are not exempted, there will be no option but to park the truck
 isliye association ne sarkaar se apil kii he ki puraane noto ko chalaane kii chhot kii seemaa badhaai jaae, vahiin, transportron ko kareeb teen lakh nikaalane kii manjuuri mili

 After the Prime Minister's statement in Patna, it was discovered that where did the matter of ten thousand crores came from? Is it mentioned in the budget? You know that in the budget of 2016-17, it was said that 20 Indian universities will be made Regulatory Architects to make them among the hundred top universities in the world
 isse zyaada kuch nahin kaha gaya he
 It is not mentioned in the higher education section in the budget of 2017-18, but a provision of 50 crores has been made for this in the expenditure part i

 ham yahi soch rahe the ki bajet main 50 karod he to 10,000 karod jitani badi raashi kaa zikr kaise aa gaya? kya itani badi raashi ke liye sansad kii manzuri zaruri nahin he? UGC has advertised to submit applications from twenty institutes within 90 days till 12 September 2017
 iske baad hamane or amitesh ne ujisi kii guidelins check kii
 Mercury 6 of Guidelines
 2 padhaa jisamen kaha gaya he ki 20 sansthaanon ko unki yojana kaa 50 se 70 fisadi diya jayega yaa 1000 karod tak diya jayega
 This amount will be given to each institution in five years
 is hisaab se is yojana kaa kul bajet hota he 20,000 karod
 Read: PM Narendra Modi turned down Nitish's demand for giving central status to Patna University, saying lekin pradhanmantri ne to 10,000 karod bolaa tha
 Has the Prime Minister reduced the budget at his level? Another guideline is found on the UGC website
 isi maamle kii guidelins maanav sansaadhan mantralay kii he or 2016 kii he
 Both guidelines are on the website of UGC and Ministry of Human Resources
 2016 kii guidelins main likhaa he ki apni yojana saunpane vaale har santhaan ko paanch saal tak 500 karod kii raashi di ja sakati he
 Accordingly, the total budget of this scheme was 10,000 crores
 yani pradhanmantri ne jo bolaa, wo 2016 ke maanav sansaadhan mantralay kii guidelins ke anusaar he
 Then when did UGC increase from 500 crores to 1000 crores, did the Prime Minister not know? padhein:pradhanmantri ne patna main jo kaha, use thik se kisi ne samajha nahin
 
 
 Not only this, the Government of India has also published a gazette in this matter
 isaki taarikh he 29 agast, 2017
 According to this gazette, no amount will be allocated to private universities
 lekin pariyojna ke liye jo sarkari raashi hogi, uskaa istamaal wo kar sakati hai
 This makes sense that private universities can also get grants from the government for research or they will start getting them
 magar chotii kii 20 uniwarsity main pahunchane ke liye sarkari uniwarsity ke saath unhen paisa nahin milegaa
 Then the same thing
 pradhanmantri ne to kaha he ki 10,000 karod main se 10 privet uniwarsity ko bhi milegaa
 The same thing is also on the website of UGC and Ministry of Human Resources

 The Prime Minister is speaking wrongly or he is being misinformed, why the UGC and the Ministry of Human Resources have issued different guidelines, if the guidelines are the same then why is the amount 500 crore in one and 1000 crore in one
 kya itani aasaani se 10,000 karod se 20,000 karod ho jaataa he? simpal sa sawaal he pradhanmantri ji, kya aap maanav sansaadhan mantri se puch sakate hai? We were thinking that if there is 50 crores in the budget, then how come the amount of Rs 10,000 crores was mentioned? Isn't the approval of Parliament necessary for such a large amount? ujisi ne 12 sitambar, 2017 tak bees sansthaanon se 90 dinon ke bheetar aavedan jamaa karne kaa vigyaapan nikaala he

 New Zealand police have confirmed the attack
 police ke dwaara ek video jari kar logon se apil kii gai he ki agar koi bhi sandigdh vyakti dikhataa he to police ko soochna den
 The attacker is said to have fired more than 50 rounds
 desh ke vibhinn ilaakon ke bukamp samvedi hone kii vajah bharat ek aisi pranali par kaam kar rahaa he, jisase bukanmp kaa purvanumaan lagaaya ja sake
 So that the damage caused by earthquake can be reduced
 vigyaan evam praudyogiki mantri dow
 Harshvardhan said that nowhere in the world, there is a system of earthquake, earthquake forecasting
 is disha main kaary chal rahe hai or bharat main bhi prayaas ho rahaa he
 According to information received from the ministry, IIT Roorkee and Taiwan in India are studying together
 neshnal centre for seismology ke deshbhar main 84 stesan hai or 150 vedhashalaayein hai
 All the centers are studying on this subject
 mantralay se praapt jaankaree ke mutabik, vigat 30 varsho ke bhuncup ke data ke vishleshan se pataa chalata he ki bhuncup kii dar main koi vruddhi athwa kami nahin ai he
 The study of earthquakes is a broad subject and no committee has been constituted in this regard although many institutes are studying on this subject
 84 digital kendron ko is prakaar se samaksh banaaya gaya he ki desh main kahin bhi 3 se adhik tivrata ke bukamp kaa paanch minute ke bheetar pataa lagaaya ja sake
 He said that we are improving it further
 jald hi teen minute ke bheetar bukamp kii jaankaree ekatra kii ja sakegi
 Right now the second phase work is going on for the development of these centers
 iske tahat 32 naye stesan sthapit kiye jaayenge or chah vartmaan steshnon kaa vikaas kiya jaayegaa
 Secretary of the Ministry of Earth Sciences, M
 Rajeevan said that by the end of 2017, there will be 116 stations of National Center for Seismology in the country
 jo rashtriya network kaa hissaa hoga
 He said that these stations and observatories will be connected to the VSAT communication system through the operational center
 ullekhneey he ki bukamp kaa khatra desh main har jagah alag-alag he
 According to this danger, the country is divided into four parts
 sabase kam khatre vaala jone 2 he tathaa sabase zyada khatre vaala jone-5 he
 All the states of north-east, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand and parts of Himachal Pradesh fall under Zone-5
 uttarakhand ke kam unchai vaale hisson se lekar uttar pradesh ke zyaadaatar hisse, dilli jone-4 main aate hai
 Central India falls under relatively low danger zone zone-3, while most of the south falls in zone-limited hazard zone-2
 abhi tak vaigyanik prithvi ke andar hone vaali bukampiy hulchalon kaa purvanumaan lagane main asamarth rahe hai
 Therefore, it is not currently possible to predict earthquakes
 vaise vishwa main is vishay par saikadon shodh chal rahe hai
 Most earthquakes in India are caused by movements in the tectonic plate because India is located on top of it, so the danger increases further
 tactonic plate main hone vaali hulchalon ke bare main shodh chal rahe hai taaki iskaa pehle hi andaja lagaaya ja sake
 Pakistan has handed over its Gwadar port to China
 yani china ne samandar main hindustan ko chautarafa gher liya he
 Pakistan will remain Gwadar Port, but it will be occupied and occupied by China
 ab china guadar port kaa istemaal beijing ke liye aarthik hub or military post main karegaa
 The agreement in Islamabad was broadcast on TV
 maukey par maujuud pakistani raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari ne kaha ki guadar port pakistan or china hi nahin balki puri duniya ke liye kaarobaar kaa adda banegaa
 There was already news of China's occupation of Pakistan's Gwadar port
 ab usapar pakistan ne hi muhar laga di he
 The port belongs to Pakistan, the occupation and occupation will be to China
 china kaa kahana he ki usne khadi deshon se tel ke liye guadar ko apana thikaana banaaya he, magar ye to bahaanaa he
 Under the guise of trade, China wants to increase its naval strength from the Arabian Sea to the Indian Ocean
 kahaan he guadar porarab sagar ke kinare maujuud guadar port ko street of hormaj ke kareeb he
 The Strait of Hormuz is the place between Oman and the Persian Gulf, where 20 percent of the world's oil is traded
 china kaa kahana he ki guadar bandargah se hote hue hind mahaasaagar se hokar wo oil shipping len bananaa chahta he
 But China's concern at Gwadar itself has increased India's concern
 yun to leh-ladakh se lekar arunachal pradesh tak china sarhad par maahaul bigaadane se baj nahin aata
 But by seizing Pakistan's Gwadar port, China is preparing to surround India in the sea
 apni is nai chaal ke saath hind mahaasaagar main bhi kai ahm thikaanon par china baith chukaa he
 The steps of China do not know how to respect the border
 
 
 yaad kiijie ki kaise ladakh se lekar arunachal pradesh tak china hamaari jameen hadapney kii firaaq main rahata he
 How is he building a military base near the border from Sikkim to other areas
 or to or, tibet or shintang main anti belastic missile bhi tainaat kar rakhaa he china ne
 Now the question arises that what is needed is a missile on the border
 lekin ab to samandar main bhi hindustan ko gherne kii uski taiyaari puri ho gayi he
 Preparing to encircle India through the sea, China has now completed the defeat of pearls to surround India through the sea
 pakistan kaa guadar port, uske baad arab sagar main kaaphi neeche utarate jaaie to maldive kaa marao ettol, phir srilanka kaa hambantota, iske baad bangladesh kaa chatgaanv or myanmar kaa citve port
 China's entire readiness to encircle India in the Indian Ocean is evident
 himalay ke us paar se koi bhi aahat khatre kii ghanti bajaati he, lekin ab to wo khatra samandar kii laharon par tairta najar aa rahaa he
 The plan to sell Gwadar Port Gwadar Port, touching the waves of the Arabian Sea, could have been helpful in improving the poor Mali condition of Pakistan, but the habit of living a life of borrowing brought Pakistan to this condition
 usne us port ko china ke naam kar diya, jo aarthik or samrik lihaaj se pakistan ke liye sabase zyada ahmiyat rakhata he
 Pakistan planned to sell Gwadar Port when Pervez Musharraf was President
 2007 main parvej musharraf ne guadar bandargah ko singapore athurity ko diya
 It cost about 1331 crore rupees to build this port, but by applying 75% of this, about one thousand crore rupees, China has got its rights on it
 is bandargah kaa kaam is vakt rukaa hua he or aakhri baar yahaan pichley saal november main koi jahaaj aayaa tha
 By the way, the Government of India also knows this
 lekin wo is maamle ko tul dena nahi chaahati
 Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid says that in the voice of the other, if Pakistan gives its Gwadar Port from Singapore to China, there is no need to react to it
 jaankaron kii maane to china kii chaahaton kii chadar sirf guadar tak hi simati hui nahin he
 Rather, by raising the Eve of India, he can also think of another port from Pakistan
 srilankai sarkaar ne daawa kiya he ki srilankai sena se muqaabale ke liye vidrohi sanghathan littey aam nagarikon ko hathiyaar kii tarah istemaal kar rahaa he
 The Government of Lanka has released some videos
 ye video littey ke kabze vaale ilaaqon se srilanka ke vimaanon ne liye the
 In it, LTTE fighters are shown carrying their arms and shells closer to the residential bases
 kaha ja rahaa he ki tamil vidrohi in nagarikon kii aad lekar sena par hamale kar rahe hai
 So that the number of civilian casualties during the war would increase and the head of the army exploded
 haalanki sena ke is video kii puri tarah tasdiq nahin kii ja sakati

 -input IANS se The Punjab and Haryana High Court has reserved its verdict till Thursday on the bail plea of former Director General of Police SPS Rathore, who is serving an 18-month sentence in the Ruchika molestation case
 avkaash nyaayadhish nyaayamurti ajay tiwari ne buudhvaar ko sibiai ke vakil anmol ratan siddhu or ajay kowshik, rathod kii patni evam vakil abha or ruchika ke parivaar kii taraf se pesh vakil pankaj bharadwaj kii daleelon ko ek ghante se bhi zyada samay tak sunne ke baad apana faisla guuruuvaar tak ke liye surakshit rakhaa
 Rathore, the former DGP, is currently lodged in the high security Burrell Jail
 nichali adaalat ne unhen 14 varshiya ruchika ke saath 12 agast 1990 ko chhedchhad karne kaa doshi pate hue dedh saal ke karawas kii sajaa sunai he
 The CBI, which is probing the case, opposed the bail plea of the former DGP and said, "he must bear some part of the sentence awarded
" ’udhar rathod kii patni tathaa unki vakil abha ne kaha, ‘ruchika ke saath chhedchhad asambhav tha kyonki maukey par 15 log upasthit the or shishe kii khidkiyaan lagi hone ke kaaran us jagah ko saaf-saaf dekha ja saktaa tha
 Ruchika had a forged signature on the complaint which was done by seven people
 ’rathod kii vakil patni abha ne kaha ki bachaav paksh ke 12 chashmadidon se poochtacha nahin kii gai he or yah maamla rathod ke netritv vaale haryana laan tennis sangh (echeltie) or haryana tennis sangh ke bich ke takaraav kaa kaaran he
 Abha said that the then DGP RR Singh, who investigated the case, was jealous of her husband
 unhone aarope lagaaya, ‘rathod ko badnaam karne ke liye kuch akhbaar, prashasnic or police adhikari ekajute hue the
 Abha said that there are at least 20 contradictions in the statements of Aradhana, the main witness in the case
 unhone kaha, ‘aradhana australia main rahete hue media main chhaayi hui hai
 He never thought about the case before
 ’ abha ne kaha ki ruchika kii saheli aradhana ke pita anand prakaash ko sarkari sevaaon se hataaya gaya he
 He also argued that 'daughter (ruchika) and her father (SC Girhotra) had not lodged a complaint in this case
 ’ unhone kaha ki jahaan tak ki aar aar singh ne us jagah jane kii jahamat nahin uthaai jahaan kathith taur par ghatana ghati thi
 Abha alleged that apart from this, the then CBI coach t Thomas, HLTA manager Kuldeep Singh and Paltu who picked up the ball were also not questioned
 abha ne aarope lagaaya ki unke paas ek tepe he jisamen girhotra ko 30 lakh rupee main yah maamla samaapt karne kii baat kehete hue dikhaaya gaya he
 Even investigating officials found that Ruchika's signature was forged
 apane pati kii jamaanat kii maang karte hue abha ne kaha, ‘yah maamla farji or avishwaneey subooton tathaa dastavejon par chal rahaa he or isamen media kaa durupyog ho rahaa he
 He argued that Ruchika was suspended from playing by HLTA due to indiscipline
 unhone kaha, ‘kathith chhedchhad ke kai dinon baad bhi ruchika tennis khilne ke liye shaam ko echeltie main ai thi
 'he alleged,' After Rucheka was stopped from playing in HLTA, the opponents conspired to avenge Rathore
 ’ nichali adaalat main maamle ko ‘anyaaypurna’ bataate hue abha ne kaha, ‘hamane rathod kii dil kii surgery ke liye ek sthaganadesh liya jabaki sibiai ne 18 sthaganadesh liye
 Opposing Rathore's bail, CBI counsel Sidhu said, "there was a need to look into the nature of the incident
" ’ unhone adaalat ke saamne daleel di ki nichali adaalat ne bhi sibiai ke subooton kaa moolyankan kiya or unki saraahna kii he
 Sidhu said, 'the CBI has direct evidence against Rathore

 ravivaar kii subah modi mantrimandal ke vistaar se pehle sahyogiyon ke saath mantri pad ko lekar pench funs gaya he
 After Shiv Sena, JDU is also not happy with the bjp's stand on cabinet expansion
 bijepi kii taraf se yah khabar aa rahi thi ki jediu ek cabinet mantri or ek rajyamantri ke prastaav par maan gai he
 But the tussle between BJP and JDU continues till Saturday afternoon over the number of ministers and the portfolio
 sutron ke mutabik jo ofer bijepi kii taraf se nitish kumaar ko diya gaya he usase vah santusht nahin hai
 However negotiations are still on and both sides feel that the matter will be resolved by Sunday evening
 jediu ko lagata he ki unki tulana ramvilas paswan kii lok janashakti party se nahin kii ja sakati jinhen ek cabinet pad mila hua he
 According to sources, someone in the JDU Modi cabinet wants a railway-like portfolio
 gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki khudnitish kumaar rail mantreerah chuke hai or bihar se unke duusare pratidwandi lalu prasad yadav or ramvilas paswan bhi pehle rail mantri rah chuke hai
 Senior JDU leader KC Tyagi responded to the question of joining the cabinet, saying that they do not know anything about the cabinet expansion, because there is no talk of his party
 aise bayaan dekar jediu apni naaraazgi saarvajanik taur par jaahir kar rahi he or bijepi par dabaav banane kii koshish bhi kar rahi he
 Amidst these reports, the JDU mps who were in the discussion to become ministers have been scared and closed in their homes and are not talking to the media at all

 vahaan unhone CPI ummidavaar kanhaiya kaa naam liye bina unhen namoona bataaya or logon se apil kii ki 'tukade-tukade gang' ko parrast kar ulte pair waapas dilli bhejein
 Amit Shah clearly stated in his speech that even though his candidate Giriraj Singh considers development as the main issue, the issue of development and poverty is bigger than the people of Begusarai defeating gangs in pieces
 shah ne apane bhaashan main congress or kanhaiya donon ko nishane par rakhaa lekin kanhaiya (kanhaiya Kumar) kaa naam nahin liya
 At the same time, Congress National President Rahul Gandhi repeatedly said that he is promoting sedition by ending the sedition
 apane bhaashan main shah (amit Shah) ne kaha ki vah kehete hai ki rajdroh kii dfa hi hataa do, to bataaie ki deshadrohiyon ko jail kii salaakhon ke peeche daalana chahie yaa nahin

 Devshayani Ekadashi has special significance in Hinduism
 manyata he ki devshayni ekadshi ke din bhagwaan vishnu (lord Vishnu) nidra main chale jate hai or phir chaar maheene baad devprabodhani ekadshi ke din uthte hai
 According to the Puranas, during these four months Lord Vishnu lives near Bali, the king of the Hades, so it is said that Shri Hari is sleeping
 in chaar maheenon ko chaturmaas ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 This is the reason that all auspicious works stop during this time
 bhagwaan ke sone kii vajah se mangalik kaary jaise ki vivaah, janeu, grih pravesh, namakaran va upanayan sanskaar nahin hote hai
 Also read: What is Devauthani Ekadashi? Know the method and importance of worship, Lord Vapana did the same
 is tarah devataaon kii chintaa khatm ho gai
 At the same time, Lord King was very happy with the sacrifice of Bali
 unhone raja bali se vardaan maangane ko kaha to bali ne unase pataal main basane kaa var maang liya
 God had to go to hell to fulfill the will of the sacrifice
 bhagwaan vishnu ke pataal jane ke baad sabhi devatagan or mata lakshmi chintit ho gaye
 In order to bring back her husband Lord Vishnu, Mother Lakshmi became a poor woman and came to King Bali and tied Rakhi by making her her brother
 badale main bhagwaan vishnu ko pataal lok se waapas le jane kaa vachan le liya
 While leaving from Patala, Lord Vishnu granted a boon to King Bali that he would reside in the Hades from Ekadashi of Ashadh Shukla Paksha to Ekadashi of Kartik Shukla Paksha
 pataal lok main unke rahane kii is avadhi ko yoganidra manajata he

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given a new point of debate to the politics of Uttar Pradesh just before the fifth phase of voting
 piem modi ne samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party ke gathbandhan par kaha he ki sapa ne mayawati ko dhokhaa diya he
 On this statement, BSP President Mayawati retaliated and said that PM Modi is trying to divide and rule
 lakhanu main ravivaar ko mayawati ne sapa or areldi se gathbandhan par kaha ki hamaara gathbandhan majboot he or piem modi ise pachaa nahin paa rahe hai
 Mayawati said that PM Modi is trying to adopt a policy of divide and rule
 congress se samjhaute ke daawey par bhi mayawati ne rukh spasht kiya
 Mayawati said that we have no alliance with the Congress and this alliance is to defeat the BJP
 isi ke chalate bijepi or aresas vaadi takaton ko kamjor karne ke liye upi main amethi-raibareli seat congress ke liye chodi gai hai
 So that both the big leaders of Congress (sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi) will contest again and not get entangled in these two seats
 piem modi kaa bayaanpradhanmantri narendra modi ne shanivaar ko upi ke pratapgarh main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha ki samaajawaadee party ne bahan ji (mayawati) ko dhokhaa diya he
 The PM said, 'congress leaders are happily sharing the stage in Samajwadi Party rallies
 mayawati khuleam congress kii aalochana karti hai, congress ko kosti hai
 At the same time, Samajwadi Party shows softness on the Congress
 upi main bhaajapa ko haraane ke liye do dhur virdohi dal gale mili
 Their friendship is no longer visible
 yahaan par samaajawaadee party ne bahan ji ko aisa dhokhaa diya he, jo unhen samaj main nahin aa rahaa he'
 Mayawati has rejected this claim of PM Modi and said that SP-BSP-RLD alliance is strong and PM Modi is in trouble with this, hence trying to create distances in SP-BSP
 mayawati ne kaha ki yah gathbandhan bhavishya ke liye bhi he

 The motion of no confidence in the government is no less a test for the government, but the opposition is more tempted as the number is with the government

 Although the government has the upper hand in the number force, there is no wrinkle in the face of the opposition
 loksabhaa main jo siton kaa sameekaran he uske mutabik bijepi ke paas akele dam par bahumat ke liye jaruri aankadon se paanch seat zyada he

 ' The Congress has decided to bring impeachment against the Chief Justice along with 6 more opposition parties after the Supreme Court's decision in the Judge Loya case
 mahabhiyog laane ko lekar congress ab tak isliye uhapoh main thi taaki, us par ram mandir ke faisle ko rokane kii tohamat na lage
 Most of the party leaders were technically in favor of it, but many leaders were opposing it for political profit and loss
 bhale hi congress ne mahabhiyog laane kaa faisla jaj loya par adaalat ke faisle or tippaniyon ke baad kar hi liya, lekin rahul raaj kii shuruyaat main party ke bheetar kai sawaal uthne lage hai
 However, this is the beginning of 'daur-e-rahul', so no leader is speaking openly
 lekin is baat kii charchaa tej he ki hindustan ke itihaas jo kabhi nahin hua ,wo qadam congress ne uthaane kaa faisla kiya he
 When the Working Committee was not discussed, many of the party leaders on the condition of anonymity said that the decision of impeachment is not a matter of right or wrong
 vishay ye he ki aitihaasik faisle se pehle party kii faisle lene vaali sabase badi body congress kaarysmiti main isaki charchaa tak nahin hui
 Interestingly, Rahul was assigned the task of forming Congress Working Committee instead of elections by AICC members at the plenary session, but till now Rahul could not even constitute it
 kuch netaaon neapas main le liya faislawaise netaaon kaa maananaa he ki kaarysmiti kaa gathan ab tak ho janaa chahie
 But if the working committee was not formed, at least by some other name, the issue could be discussed in a big way by calling a meeting in the party
 lekin aisa kuch nahin hua
 Some leaders decided among themselves and got the green signal from Rahul
 sonia kii tarj par rahul gandhicongress adhyaksh kii kaman sanbhaalane ke baad rahul party ke bheetar loktantr kii vakaalat karte aae hai
 No one has come forward, but he himself insisted on becoming the party president from the electoral process and also fulfilled it
 lekin adhyaksh banane ke baad party main kaarysmiti kaa chunaav sonia kii tarj par unhone bhi nahin karaayaa or manonith karne kaa mandet hasil kar liya
 But even after passing so much time, they could not form it
 isi bich itnaa bada faisla ho gaya to sawaal uthanaa laazmi hi he
 There were two opinions in the party, one went along with Rahul
 Interestingly, in Rahul Raj, there is often talk of bringing the senior to the side, while Rahul himself repeatedly advocates reconciliation between the two
 is mahabhiyog ke faisle main bhi rahul ne varisht netaaon main do-faad dekhte hue ek tabake kii akhirkaar sun lee
 Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad and Kapil Sibal played a major role in this, while leaders like Ahmed Patel, Veerappa Moily, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Salman Khurshid were sidelined
 kaarysmiti main charchaa kii jarurataise main jab party ke bheetar ek raay na ho or faisla itnaa bada ho, to phir party ke bheetar kaarysmiti main charchaa hona laazmi hi hota he
 But the question remains that, if the working committee is not yet formed, then how is the discussion? Yes, there could have been a big discussion on this issue within the party by some other name, which did not happen
 argedy netaa tejasvi yadav ne apane bade bhai or purv swasthya mantri tejpratap yadav ke apni patni aishwarya se talaak lene ke faisle par kisi prakaar kii tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya he
 In response to a question in Jharkhand's capital Ranchi, Tejashwi Yadav said that the issue of rift between Tej Pratap and Aishwarya is not a public interest issue, which he should discuss among the public
 tejasvi yadavane kaha ki tejpratap yadav kaa apni patni ko talaak dene kaa faisla lalu parivaar kaa aantarik maamla he, jise parivaar ke log aapas main hi sulajhaa lenge
 He also expressed displeasure at the media over his elder brother's divorce case and said that this was not a subject to be reported on daily
 tejasvi yadav ne kaha ki media ko kisi bhi rajaneta ke nijee jivan par reporting karne se bachanaa chahie
 If the media will be reporting on the private lives of politicians, then it will be difficult to get from the Chief Minister to the Prime Minister
 aapako bataa den ki shuukravaar ko tejasvi yadav dilli se ranchi pahunche the, jahaan unhone apane pita or argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav se aspataal main mulaakaat kii
 This was Tejashwi Yadav's first meeting with his father Lalu Prasad Yadav after Tej Pratap announced his wife's divorce
 isse pehle tejpratap ne ranchi pahunchakrlalu yadavase mulaakaat kii thi or apni patni ko talaak dene ke apane faisle se avgat karaayaa tha
 According to sources, Lalu Prasad Yadav tried his best to convince his elder son not to divorce Aishwarya
 magar iske baavjood tejpratap nahin maane or apane faisle par ade hai
 At the same time, Lalu Prasad Yadav's health has deteriorated since Tej Pratap's announcement of divorcing his wife and he is going into depression
 unka ilaaj kar rahe doctoron ne kaha he ki lalu yadav ko aajkal neend kaaphi kam aa rahi he or unki haalat bigadati ja rahi he
 Here, his mother Rabri Devi is also shocked after Tejapratap's decision in Patna and has decided not to do Chhath Puja this year
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 se pehle uttar pradesh kii yogi adityanath sarkaar ek bada faisla le sakati he
 According to sources, CM Yogi Adityanath is once again preparing to forgive the farmers' debt
 uttar pradesh sarkaar jila str par iske liye survey kar rahi he
 The purpose of this survey is to identify those farmers who could not avail of the loan waiver last time
 bataa den ki uttar pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan bijepi sarkaar ne kisaanon kaa karj maaf karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 After winning the election, the BJP government had also waived the debt of the farmers
 report ke mutabik tab kai kisaanon ko aanshik karjamaafee hi mil pai thi
 Many farmers were also unable to avail of loan waiver due to technical disturbances
 yogi sarkaar is survey ke dwaara aise kisaanon kii pahchaan karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 If the Yogi government executes this move, it will be seen as a big exercise in trying to woo the farmers before the Lok Sabha elections
 bataa den ki 2017 main sarkaar banate hi yogi cabinet ne seemaant kisaanon kaa ek lakh tak kaa karj maaf karne kaa faisla liya tha
 The state government had announced a budget of 32 thousand crore rupees for this
 kisaanon kii karj maafee ek baar phir se charchaa main tab ai jab pichley saal disbanr main madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main congress kii sarkaar bani
 Congress had promised loan waiver to farmers during elections in these three states
 vaade ke mutabik teenon rajyon kii congress sarkaron ne sarkaar banaate hi pehle kaam ke rup main kisaanon ke karj maafee kii ghoshnaa kii
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi projected it as a pro-farmer image of the Congress
 kisaanon kii karj maafee ke baad rahul ne kaha ki unhone jo kaha he wo kar dikhaaya he
 Rahul said that now Prime Minister Narendra Modi should also forgive the debt of farmers
 rahul ne yah kah bijepi par dabaav badha diya ki agar modi karj maaf nahin karte hai to vah 2019 main satta main aane ke baad kisaanon ko karj maafee kii saugat denge
 Rahul had said, "until Modi does not forgive the debt of the farmers of the country, till then we will put so much pressure on them that they will not let them sleep and will get the debt forgiven
 "madhyapradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main haar ke baad baikfoot par ai bijepi netritv ne kai maukon par karj maafee ke prastaav par vichaar manthan kiya tha

 uttar pradesh sarkaar ne gambhir aarope lagane vaale adhikari didi mishra ko maansik rup se pareshaan qaraar diya he
 While presenting the clarification on behalf of the state government, UP Chief Secretary (home) Fateh Bahadur said that the mental condition of DIG DD Mishra, who described the Mayawati government as corrupt, is not well, medical checkup provides such information
 uttar pradesh ke ek senior ipies adhikari ne jab upi sarkaar par bhrashtachar ke gambhir aarope lagaae, to police ne use aspataal pahunchaa diya
 On the other hand, former UP DGP Prakash Singh has also accused the Maya government of being corrupt

 bhrashtachar ke aarope lagane par adhikari ko dimagi taur par diwalia qaraar de diya gaya
 Till now the UP government has not investigated Mishra's allegations
 didi mishra fire brigade ke diaiji hai
 When he got angry for not getting promotion for four years, he wrote on the files itself, Mayawati Sarkar is illustrious
 iske baad daftar main media ko gaya bulaayaa
 When news of this gathering spread, there was a stir in the government
 jo anna samarthak afasar apane daftar main maaya sarkaar ke khilaaf aag ugal rahe the, use sirf itnaa pataa tha ki iskaa anjaam kya hone ja rahaa he
 According to the DIG, he could have exposed the government scams long ago, but the inspiration of Anna Hazare's movement gave him the courage to open the pole of the Maya government
 haalanki anna ke is samarthak ko na jail bheja gaya, naa uski baaten suni gayi
 The police started investigating the mental condition of the DIG
 doctor ko bulaayaa gaya or police ne elaan kar diya ki maaya sarkaar ke khilaaf ungali uthaane vaale afasar kii dimagi haalat thik nahin he
 The police claim that DD Mishra had locked himself in the office before accusing the Mayawati government and was not ready to return home even after persuading the family
 yi hi vajah he ki police ko hastkshep karnaa padaa
 Despite this, the question arises that is it permissible to forcibly take the officer to the hospital by encircling the office? Does this move of the administration not raise questions about the government's intentions? Has there been any attempt to investigate Mishra's allegations? If indeed Mishra's mental condition is not correct, then what steps did the government take? Why was there no attempt to cure his condition? If Mishra's mental condition is not right, then how did he continue in service? chhattisgarh ke durg jile kii central jail main balaatkaar ke aaropee ek vichaaradhin kaidi ko duusare kaidiyon ne peet petakar maar daalaa

 karnataka main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke ek bayaan ne 2019 aam chunaav se pehle ek nai bahes ko hawa de di he
 On Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi said that if the Congress becomes the largest party in 2019, then he will definitely become the Prime Minister
 is bayaan par pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi rahul ko gheraa
 But if we look at the history, it can be seen how Rahul Gandhi's politics has changed in the last five years, and this is reflected in his statement as well
 2013 main kaha tha 'satta jehar ke samaan'darasal, 2013 main rahul gandhi ko jab congress party kaa upaadhyaksh banaaya gaya
 Then at the Congress conference in Jaipur, Rahul Gandhi in his statement described power as poison
 rahul ne kaha, '' beeti raat meri maa mere paas ain or kaha ki satta jehar ke samaan he jo takat ke saath khatre ko bhi saath main laati he
 He had said that every Indian has the right to equal power, in such a situation why only a few people should have the key to power
 2018 main bole- main banuunga pradhanmantridarasal, mangalvaar ko karnataka main logon se baat karte hue rahul gandhi ne kaha tha, ''aap log abhi mere bayaan par hasenge lekin 2019 main bijepi sarkaar nahin banaaegi
 He said that today the opposition is one, which is why it will be difficult for BJP in 2019
 jab rahul gandhi se pradhanmantri pad ke liye sawaal poocha gaya, ki kya ve pradhanmantri banenge
 So he said, "if the Congress party comes to power then why not
 unhone kaha ki agar 2019 main congress sabase badi party banati he to vah piem ban sakate hai
 "how much Rahul has changed in 5 years? Significantly, there has been a lot of change in the politics of Rahul Gandhi in the last few times
" rahul kaa bhaashan dene kaa tarika, iske alaava soshal media kaa istemaal kaaphi aakraamak hua he
 The Congress President now directly attacks Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 haalanki, in paanch saal main congress party ko rahul kii aguwai main hi kai rajyon main haar kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa he
 But the way in the last year Gujarat elections in which the Congress competed against the BJP in PM Modi and Amit Shah's stronghold Gujarat, the enthusiasm of Congress workers was at the peak
 adhyaksh pad sanbhaalane ke baad bhi rahul ne party str par bade badlaav kiye or yuvaaon ko mauka dene kaa vaada kiya
 At the same time, never before had Rahul Gandhi submitted himself as prime minister
 aisa pehali baar hi he jab unhone kaha ho ki vah pradhanmantri banane ko taiyaar hai
 Preparation to send message to colleagues! Rahul Gandhi's statement also becomes very important because many political parties in the country are engaged in the exercise of forming a non-bjp, non-congress front
 vipaksh kii kai partiyon or netaaon ne kai maukon par aisa kaha he ki rahul gandhi main netritv kii kshamta nahin he
 There have also been many occasions in which the Congress colleagues have been seen falling apart because of Rahul
 rahul ne pichley ek saal main vipaksh ko saadhane kii koshish kii he or khud ko vipaksh ke bade netaa ke taur par project bhi kiya he
 Whether it is opposition to demonetisation or to open a front against the government on the issue of GST
 haal hi main unnav-kathua gangrape ke mudde par bhi jis tarah unhone modi sarkaar ko gheraa usapar bhi unki kaaphi tarif hui
 Rahul had also met RJD chief Lalu Yadav recently for opposition unity, while the Congress is in constant touch with other parties as well
 PM ne bhi ksaa he tanjarahul gandhi ke pradhanmantri banane ke bayaan par piem modi ne bhi tippanee kii
 Addressing an election rally in Karnataka on Wednesday, he said the Congress leader's statement reflects Namdar's arrogance
 koi kaise apane aap ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar saktaa he
 He said that these are such nominees who do not even trust their fellow leaders

 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and the entire BJP may be determined not to repeat Gorakhpur and Phulpur in the Kairana by-election, but the opposition wants to present a Nazir without defeating Akhilesh and Mayawati
 yahi vajah he ki akhilesh yadav kii taraf se yah elaan kar diya gaya he ki vah kairana or nurpur ke upachunaav main chunaav prachaar nahin karenge
 Let me tell you that Tabassum Hasan is contesting from Kikarana Lok Sabha seat
 ve sapa kii netaa rahi hai or unke bete nahid hasan maujuuda samay main sapa se hi vidhayak hai
 In the by-election, Jayant Chaudhary declared Tabassum Hasan as his candidate for the alliance with RLD-SP
 jabaki nurpur main sapa khud chunaav lard rahi he lekin akhilesh yadav donon siton par chunaav prachaar karne nahin jaaenge
 Yogi Adityanath, unlike Akhilesh, is determined to save the fort of Kairana this time
 kairana main yogi adityanath kii do badi sabhaayen ho chuki hai
 Yogi Adityanath and Keshav Maurya have also been seen campaigning together in the same helicopter since there are no differences between them
 haalanki basapa pramukh mayawati ne aupchaarik taur par areldi ummidavaar ko samarthan kaa elaan nahin kiya he
 But it is believed that signs have been given to activists on behalf of Mayawati
 ek charchaa yah bhi he ki 27 may ko hone vaale party ke rashtriya padaadhikariyon kii baithak main mayawati aupchaarik taur par ajit singh kii party areldi kii ummidavaar tabassum hasan ko samarthan kaa elaan kar sakati hai
 Yogi Adityanath's close aide and party spokesman Dr
 Chandra Mohan said that this time Kairana's victory is certain
 yah gorakhpur or phulpur main hue chunavi nateezon kaa badla bhi hoga, kyonki is baar puraa vipaksh ek ho chukaa he
 Even the Lok Dal candidates and other independents are sitting forcefully in support of Yen Kane type RLD
 baavjood iske bijepi kii badi jeet hogi
 This time the Samajwadi Party camp wants to win this victory without campaigning for Akhilesh Yadav, so that the atmosphere for 2019 can be intensified
 mayawati or akhilesh ke gaye bagaiyr yah jeet hoti he to bijepi ke liye or bhi dabaav kii sthiti paidaa ho sakati he

 Recently, Kangana also reached the singing reality show 'the Voice of India Season 2'
 lekin yaha pramotion ke liye gai kangana ne ek or vivaad khadaa kar diya
 In fact, Kangana got angry with Sugandha Mishra, the host of this show, that she told him to slap her
 haalanki sugandha mishra ne is baat ko kaaphi halke main uda diya
 Sugandha Mishra also appears in Kapil Sharma's comedy show, The Kapil Sharma Show
 sugandha apane gane or apni mimicri ke liye jaani jaati hai
 When Kangana came on the show, the judges of the show Salim Merchant and Shaan asked Sugandha to imitate Kangana in front of Kangana
 jajon ke kehane par sugandha ne film 'tanu vaids manu riterns' main kangana ke kirdaar datto kii nakal kar di
 Kangana was not much impressed by Sugandha's mimicry but Kangana was very angry and said, 'I felt like slapping her (sugandha)
 ' sutron ke mutabik is vaake ke baad puure sho ke dauraan kangana kaa bartaav sugandha ke liye kaaphi ruukhaa sa rahaa
 The comments bataa den ki sugandha isse pehle bhi kai baar kangana kii mimicri karti rahi hai jise log kaaphi pasand karte hai

 Kangna told that because we did not have any dressing room or vanity there, that was our compulsion
 jab kangana is sho par ain to is sho ke jaj saleem marchent or shaan ne sugandha se kangana ke saamne hi kangana kii nakal karne ko kaha
 At the behest of the judges, Sugandha copied Kangana's character Datto in the film 'tanu Weds Manu Returns'
 sugandha kii is mimicri par kangana zyada prabhavit to nahin huin balki kangana ne is par kaaphi bhadak gayi or unhone kaha, 'mujhe use (sugandha ko) thappad maarane kaa man hua
 According to sources, after this incident, Kangana's behavior throughout the show was quite rough for Sugandha

 jangalon main shooting kii parmishan ke liye vishaal ko sarkari or nijee daftaron ke khub chakkar bhi kaatane pade the
 Some time ago, actress Kangana Ranaut had said in a statement that during the shooting of the film, the team had to go to the forest and behind the hills and behind the bushes and do things like changing the toilet and clothes
 kangana ne bataaya kyonki hamaare paas vahaan par koi dressing room yaa venity nahin thi isliye hamaari yah majaburi thi

 Rashtriya Janata Dal national vice president and senior party leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh has once again made a political prediction that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and RJD may once again come close
 haalanki unki baat ko party ke sarvesava tejasvi yadav ne is baat yah kahkar kaarij kar diya hai ki aisi koi baat nahin hai or isamen koi tathy nahin he
 At the same time, if the leaders of Janata Dal United are to be believed, then this is not likely
 iske peeche unka yahi tark hai ki nitish kumaar bijepi ke saath sarkaar chalaane main comfort hai ve argedy ke saath koi guarantee nahin de saktaa
 Actually, Nitish Kumar has a poor experience of almost two and a half years behind it
 jab vah argedy ke saath sarkaar chalaa rahe the to har vibhaag main tabadalaa or posting main argedy adhyaksh lalu yadav kaa hastkshep hota tha vahiin wo thana tak ko phone karne se parhez nahin karte the
 Secondly, the leaders of the BJP keep themselves limited to suggestions even in the posting of district officers, even if they are away from the police department
 nitish ko is baat kaa andaaza hai ki sarkaar kaa iqbaal samanaantar shashan vyavastha se kam hota hai isliye wo argedy ke saath phir se sarkaar banane ke atakalon ko bahut zyaada bhav nahin dete
 After the Maharashtra incident, now even the BJP leaders of Bihar believe that the central leadership, which has already clarified that the Bihar assembly elections will be fought under the leadership of Nitish Kumar, they now have more than a limit on seat sharing
 Are not in khaaskar jab bagal ke jharkhand main daagi vyaktiyon ko tikat dene ke baad to bijepi or janata dal united ne bhrashtachar kaa mudda bihar kii raajnneeti main kho chuki he or iske liye bijepi kaa sheersh netritv zimmedaar he
 However, the BJP leaders believe that if Nitish re-establishes relations with Lalu Yadav, he has nothing left to speak as he not only forged ties with tainters in every state, but also adopted tricks to form the government
 jiske kaaran ab bijepi koi siddhanton vaali party nahin rahi
 Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, however, says that what he is saying is the opinion of most of the mlas and leaders of his party who believe that the victory of the by-election cannot be the trend of general elections in Bihar at least
 khaaskar jab muqaabala nitish banaam tejasvi hoga to wo ladaai isliye ekatarfa hogi ki jab lalu yadav ke saath ramvilas paswan the tab nitish 206 siten jeetne main kaamyaab hue the to ab paswan bhi endie main hai
 a girl from Pakistan comes on social media and then, through her message and video, she makes headlines all over Pakistan
 kuch uske massej or video ko islam ke chashme se dekhte hai to kuch behuudagi kii najar se
 Then one day suddenly his own brother strangles him to death
 pakistan main is maut ko shoharat banaam gairat bataaya ja rahaa he
 Yes, it was the same Pakistani model Kandil Baloch who was murdered on Friday
 apane bhai ne hi utaar diya maut ke ghatbahut kam pakistani hai jinhen soshal media kii paidaaish mana jaataa he
 Kandeel Baloch was one of them, who believed in the saying that what if the names were bad? People knew him by the name of the drama Queen Kim Kardashian or Hindustani Poonam Pandey and this fame brought him to such a situation that his own brother himself strangled him with his hands and named this death of fame
 Of non-interest
 kandil ke divaane the kai logpakistani media kii jaan thi kandil
 The Sharif people do not talk about him openly, but he was always interested in every news, every video, every post, every tweet
 uske bayanon, uski tasveeron, uske video par itani charchaa hoti ki wo soshal media par trend karti
 From the elderly Pakisatani boys, all the other Majnu's were among those who died on Kandil's murderous rituals, and even one Maulana Saheb was such a prince of Kandeel that before seeing the moon of Eid he used to cherish the candle of the candle
 ye alag baat he ki apni aadat ke mutabik mufti sahab ke saath kandil kaa ek video jaise hi pakistan main varayal hua, id ke chand se pehle khud mufti sahab ko istipha dena padaa
 Kandeel Baloch, who hails from Kulmultan, went to her home from Karachi to celebrate Eid
 vahiin shuukravaar kii raat kandil ke apane bhai mohammad wasim ne uski galaa dabaa kar hatya kar di
 Before suppressing throat, Wasim had also given Kandeel an anesthetic
 wasim ne khud apane munh se kandil ke katl kii kahani sanaai he
 By the way, let us tell you that in Pakistan, the law of a common murder and a murder for unmatched law is different
 aam katl main pakistan main bhi maut tak kii sajaa he magar gairat ke liye kiye gaye katl main thodi dheel he
 For example, if the people of Kandil give a statement to the police that they are forgiving their son for killing their daughter, Wasim will not be punished much but he will be left out
 bharat main bhi bator chuki thi surkhiyandrasal, kandil ek aise mulk main rah rahi thi, jahaan ke mardon ko auraten parde main zyada acchhee lagati hai
 But Kandeel shrugged off those curtains and from here he got his name as well as his name
 pakistani soshal media main chaa jane ke baad kandil kaa naam big bos ke agle sijan ke ummidavaar ke taur par bhi uchhalane laga tha
 Kandeel had also made headlines in India because of his videos about Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the india-pakistan match in the World Cup
 shahid afridi ke naam videobaat zyada puraani nahin he jab kandil baloch, kandil baloch nahin balki ek aam pakistani ladki hua karti thi
 The Kandil, which came from a common household of Multan, was also bound by the traditions of society and used to follow the rituals of the curtain
 magar ek baar multan se baahar nikal kar jaise hi wo karachi pahunchi puure pakistan main wo soshal media kaa nayaa cheharaa ban gai
 Social media, in a way, gave Kandeel a new identity and a new name
 world cap main bharat ko haraane par kandil baloch ne shahid aafridi ke liye thik vaise hi stripaties karne kii baat kahi thi jaise bahut pehle bharat kii punam pandey ne kahi thi
 This video stirred up all over Pakistan
 kandil par behuudagi failaane ke iljaam lage
 The team of Aadhar Afridi, the video cast against PM Modi, lost to India
 iske baad kandil ne behad gusse main dobaaraa ek video post kiya
 Then after this video, Kandeel posted another video for Virat Kohli, the hero of India's victory in that match
 lekin bharat me kandil baloch pehali baar tab surkhiyaan bani thi jab usne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bare main fasebuk par ek video daalaa tha
 After this video Kandeel got a lot of answers from India
 isi ke baad kandil ne fouran doosraa video massej daalaa or isamen na sirf narendra modi kii tarif kii balki pehle vaale apane bayaan ke liye maafee bhi maangi
 Right now Kandeel was making headlines with all these things that at the same time a video album of his came
 is video album ko lekar bhi pakistan main khub hangaamaa hua
 Kandeelmagar wanted to breathe in the open air, as much uproar as Kandeel used to get fame
 ab dekhte hi dekhte wo pakistani tivi kii bhi chaheti ban gai
 In the meantime, another video of it created a ruckus in Pakistan
 is baar usne sachmuch apana stripaties dance kaa video fasebuk par daal diya
 It is true that Kandil was living her way in an open air, bypassing the veils of traditions
 ho saktaa he uskaa tarika galat ho lekin usase jeene kaa haq chhinana bhi sahi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 In the month of Ramadan, the video of Kandeel opening Iftar with a Mufti went viral on social media and Mufti Sahab lost his chair
 mufti bhi bane katl kii ahm vajahakandil baloch ke katl kii vajahon main se ek vajah karachi ke ye mufti sahab bhi bane
 Actually, just a month ago, a video of these Mufti Sahab from Karachi was put on social media by Kandeel himself
 iske baad to puure pakistan main hadakamp much gaya
 After the arrest, Kandeel's brother, in his statement, cited the reasons for the murder and that video was also mentioned about Mufti Saheb
 darasal mufti sahab kandil ke saath lagaataar sampark main the
 Both used to talk on phone and message and if Kandeel himself believed, Mufti Sahab had told Kandeel many times that he wanted to meet him
 mufti sahab karachi ke hilaal cameti ke bhi sadsy the, jo id kaa chand dekhne ke baad adhikarik rup se chand dikhne or id kaa elaan karte hai
 His life had gone through ups and downs; Baloch came to Karachi about seven years ago to try his luck in the modeling world
 use chote-mote kaam bhi mili par shoharat soshal media ne dilaai
 He also revealed his open mind by his own video
 kandil ke kul chah bhai or teen bahanen hai
 Walid lives in Multan
 garib ghar se aane vaali kandil kii puraani kahani bhi behad utaar-chadha vaali rahi he
 Actually, Kandeel had been married thrice before coming to Karachi
 teen baar shaadi kar chuki thi kandiljuly 2003 main kandil kii shaadi shahid baloch se hui thi, jo peshey se tailor master he
 Shahid is a resident of Peshawar
 magar shaadi ke baad shahid ko pataa chalaa ki kandil kaa pehle bhi kisi se nikaah ho chukaa he
 So the two split up
 iske baad 22 farvari 2008 ko kandil ne mujffargarh ke aashiq hossain se shaadi kii
 Both of them also had a son, but when the son was 11 months, Kandeel separated from the husband with a son
 aashiq hossain kaa kahana he ki kothi par kabje ke chalate kandil ne use choda tha
 Kandeel later had to return his son Aashiq in 2009 on the court's order
 or isliye kandil ko kar diya duniya se rukhsatbaad main kandil karachi chali ai or yaheen modelling kii duniya main kismat aajamaane lagi
 But she did not get any special success in modeling
 usne kuch mujeec elbm main bhi kaam kiya
 But then she gained fame when she started putting her videos on social media
 police ke mutabik soshal media par kandil kii tasveeron or video ke chalate uske ghar vaale kaaphi naakhush the
 Neighbors and experts used to taunt them
 or bas isiilie khud kandil ke bhai ne gairat ke naam par kandil ko maar daalaa
 The mercury crossed 51 on Saturday in Phalodi, Rajasthan
 mausam vibhaag ke mutabik bharat ke itihaas main aaj sabase garm din hone vaala he

 'kartikeya' or 'yamirukka bymey' jaisi chote bajet kii filmon ne na keval jabardast kamai kii, balki niveshkon ke liye bhi munafa kamaaya
 Big films like 'lingaa', 'kaththi', 'veeram' and 'agadu' also did well at the box office, but they could not meet the standards of hit films
 film trade vishleshak trinath ne bataaya, 'ek hit film vah he, jo nirmaataa se lekar film distributor or theatre maaliktak harek invester ko munafa detii he
 The movies of all these stars are sold at very high prices, so it becomes very difficult for the distributor and the rest of the investors to earn profits

 kaha ja rahaa he ki 12 karod ke bajet se bani 'aranmanay' ne 22 karod rupee kamaaye hai
 Trinath said, "all the films except Aranmanai" are made in the budget of Rs 10 crore, but they have managed to earn almost double the amount at the box office
 in filmon ne sabhi niveshkon ko munafa diya he, kyonki unhen unase ritis kharidne main zyada kharchaa nahin karnaa padaa tha
 The rest of the popular Tamil films include 'manjapay', 'sathuranga Vettai', 'kathai Thiraikathai Vasanam Iyakkam', 'mundasupatti' and 'naigal Zakirathai'
 film distributor arvind nambiar ne kaha, 'darshak filmon main creative work ko pasand kar rahe he
 It is an important factor in the success of small budget films like "sathuranga Vettai"
 koun ummid karegaa ki ek kute kii lead role vaali 'nigal jakirathi' jaisi film itnaa acha kaarobaar karegi
 According to Nambiar, the best hit Tamil film Actor Dhanush's 'vella Illa Pattathari' is in terms of bringing profits to investors
 aath karod ke bajet se bani is film ne 53 karod rupee kamaaye the

 Addressing the Chief Ministers of the state, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that they want to make India a 5 trillion or 5 thousand billion dollar economy by 2024
 bhartiya arthvyavastha philhal kareeb 190 lakh karod (maujuuda dar ke anusaar jidipi, 2018-19) kii he
 Its average value is about 2 when converted to dollars
 8 trillian dollar baithta he
 This means that the Indian economy will have to nearly double to reach the $ 5 trillion target in the next five years
 kya 5 trillian dollar kaa lakshya vaastavik he? agar dollar ke sandarbh main dekhen to do mukhya kaarak aise hai jo bharat kii vikaas dar ke is lakshya tak pahunchane ko prabhavit kar sakate hai:1
 Inflation rate 2
 rupaya or dollar kii vinimay daramhangaai dar badhane kaa kaa arth he ki vastuon ke daam badhenge
 With the rise in inflation, the purchasing power of the rupee will decrease, which will reduce consumption and negatively impact GDP growth
 bharat main mahangaai (upabhokta mulya suchakank) niyantrit rahi he or agast 2018 se 4% ke aasapaas hi rah rahi he
 This 3 last month
 05% darj kii gai
 Similarly, to reach the target of $ 5 trillion, the exchange rate of rupee and dollar will also have to be kept under control
 agar aage chalakar rupee kaa mulya ghatata he to dollar ke sandarbh main yah bharat kii arthvyavastha par bura asar daalega, lekin agar dollar ke mukaable rupaya majboot hota he to isse is lakshya tak pahunchnaa aasaan ho jayega
 Sujan Hazra, executive director and chief economist, Anand Rathi Securities, says, "inflation in India is above 3% and global inflation is not too high
 mahangaai dar anukool dikh rahi he or yahaan tak ki global mahangaai dar koi aisa sanket nahin de rahi he ki mulyon main badhottaree hogi
 This will help India's DGP growth reach $ 5 trillion
 yah lakshya avastavik bilkul nahin he agar rupaya kamjor na ho
 '5 trillion dollar economy is not difficult
 
 
 bhartiya arthvyavastha sahi raste par he
 In dollar terms, India's nominal GDP was $ 388 billion in 1996, it more than doubled to $ 920 billion in the next ten years, ie in 2006
 agle das saal yani 2016 main yah phir se dogune se zyada hokar 2
 3 trillion reached, so making India a $ 5 trillion economy is not a difficult task
 yah lakshya puraa karne ke liye bharat ko agle paanch saalon tak salanaa ausat vruddhi dar dollar ke sandarbh main 11

 april, 2019 main antarrashtri mudra kosh (IMF) ne 2019-20 ke liye bharat kii jidipi growth kaa anumaan 20 binduon ke aadhaar par gata diya he
 Accordingly, this 7 in 2019-20
 3% or 2020-21 main 7
 5%
 imef kii hi tarah asian deveopment bank (edibi) or rigerv bank aaf india (arabiai) ne bhi yah anumaan gata diya he
 ADB Gives India's GDP Growth7
 2% rahane kaa anumaan jataayaa he jo ki pehle 7
 6%, while the Monetary Policy Committee of RBI also recently estimated India's DGP rate for 2019-20 7
 2% se ghataakar 7% kar diya he
 7 about India's real GDP growth in rupees
 5% kaa anumaan lagaaya he, vah agle paanch saal tak jari rahaa to yah 2024 tak 5 trillian dollar ke paar chali jaaegi
 For the goal of a $ 5 trillion economy, refer to nominal GDP, if the real GDP growth is 7-7
 5% rahati he to 4-4
 Nominal growth 11 to 5% inflation rate
 5% honi chahie

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni expressed happiness over Australia's goal of exceeding 350 runs for the second time in Nagpur in the current seven-match cricket series on Wednesday, but also said that achieving such a big goal from most boundaries is a long time
 Is not right for cricket
 australia ne captain george baili (156) or shen watasan (102) ke tufaani shatakon kii madad se chah wicket par 350 ran kaa vishaal score khadaa kiya tha
 India responded with the help of Virat Kohli (115 not out off 66 balls with a six and 18 fours) and the century of opener Shikhar Dhawan (100), winning 351 for four with three balls remaining
 bharat ne isse pehle jaipur main duusare van-de main 360 ran ke lakshya ko 44wein over main hi hasil kar liya tha
 Dhoni said after the match, 'after the change in rules, more runs are being scored against the bowlers
 ek atirikt khilaadi andar hota he jisase ballebaajon ke liye ran bananaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 It seems that 350 runs are like 280, 290 or 300 runs before
 tej gendbaaj bhi third main or fine leg ko andar rakhkar gendbaaji karne lage hai
 ' unhone kaha, ‘mujhe nahin pataa ki khel kis ore ja rahaa he
 It is entertaining, but if we continue to achieve this goal then it will not be good for the health of the game in the long run
 hamen aaj saat ghante main sirf chauke or chakke hi dekhne ko mili
 ' lakshya kaa peechha karte hue ranneeti ke bare main poochne par dhoni ne kaha, ‘hamane pehle 30 over ke antaraal ko pehle liya or iske liye ranneeti banaai
 We planned that if we make around 180 runs in the first 30 overs, then we can make the remaining runs in the subsequent 20 overs because it will also have power play overs
 ’ Dhoni credited this victory to the opening pair of Dhawan and Rohit Sharma (79) apart from Kohli, who gave India a brilliant start by sharing a record 178 runs for the first wicket
 bhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki shikhar or rohit ne shandaar ballebaaji kii
 Shikhar scored a century, but Rohit was having trouble and was unable to find the gap, but he managed to withstand the pressure and played a good innings
 ’ He said, 'virat Kohli once again played a brilliant innings
 gend puraani ho gai thi, lekin australia ke tej gendbaaj kaaphi achche hai or usne un par palatwaar kiya
 He eased the batting
 usne jis tarah se baaki ballebaajon se dabaav hataaya vah shandaar tha
 ' shrunkhlaa kaa saatvaan or nirnaayak match 2 november ko bangalore ke chinnaswami stadium main khelaa jayega or dhoni ne kaha ki ek baar phir bade score kii ummid kii ja sakati he
 He said, 'bangalore is known for big score matches
 vahaan tii-20 maichon main 180 ke aasapaas ran ban jate hai isliye nahin pataa ki vahaan lakshya dene yaa hasil karne ke liye kitne ran paryaapt honge
 ' australia kii ore se shatak jadne vaale captain baili ne kaha ki haar niraashajanak rahi
 He said, 'it was disappointing (that we lost)
 viraat ne behtareen pari kheli
 It was a great wicket to bat on
 hamen shuruyaat main jald wicket chatakaane kii jarurat thi lekin aisa nahin kar paae
 ' baili ne kaha ki vah ab bangalore main antim or nirnaayak match main jeet darj karne kii koshish karenge
 Man of the match Kohli said that Rohit and Shikhar had reduced the pressure considerably by giving a good start
 kohli ne kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki hamaari yahi ranneeti thi
 Rohit and Shikhar gave us a good platform
 shikhar kii mansapeshiyon main baad main khinchaav aa gaya tha or yah ahm tha ki ham donon main se ek ank tak tikaa rahe
 i took some risks initially and was successful
 maine sochaa ki mujhe shikhar ko ant tak ballebaaji karne deni chahie lekin uske out hone ke baad maine sochaa ki ab mujhe match khatm karnaa hoga

 Constant questions are being raised about the role of coach Duncan Fletcher due to the consistently poor performance of the Indian team, but captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni defended him
 shanivaar ko unhone kaha ki haar ke liye coach nahin balki khilaadi jimmedaar hai
 After Fletcher took over as coach, India suffered a crushing defeat in England and Australia tour
 iske baad england or pakistan ke haathon gharelu sirijon main haar ne rahi sahi kasar puri kar di
 Since then, there has been a demand to replace Fletcher as an Indian coach
 dhoni ne pakistan ke khilaaf ravivaar ko hone vaale tisare or aakhri match kii purv sandhya par kaha, 'coach aapako keval guide kar sakate hai
 Coaches can help you
 aapaki kisi kami ko dur karne kii koshish kar sakate hai lekin ve maidan par nahin ja sakate
 i think it is wrong to blame the coach
 haar kii jimmedaari khilaadiyon kii hoti he kyonki maidan par unhen pradarshan karnaa hota he
 "indian foreigners are chicken, when the Indian captain was asked that instead of a foreign coach, there is a demand to make an Indian a coach, he said in a funny manner," i do not know what is a native foreigner
 main itnaa jaanata hu deshi videshi murge hote hai
 Dhoni reiterated that if India wants to win the third match, then the team will have to do well in all three departments
 unhone kaha ki hamaare paas pratibha he lekin hamen milakar pradarshan karnaa hoga
 If we bat well in a match, then our bowling is not good in that
 jeet ke liye hamen teenon vibhaag main acha pradarshan karnaa hoga
 Regarding the pitch of Ferozeshah Kotla, Dhoni said, "it looks like the traditional wicket of Kotla
" match 12 baje shuru hoga lekin adhik garmi hone kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Nothing can be said about the wicket
 match se pehle hi uski sthiti ke bare main kuch kaha ja saktaa he
 Regarding the recent changes in ODI cricket, the Indian captain said that the team is trying to keep pace with him
 unhone kaha, 'pichley do maichon main to hamen bahut zyada pareshaani nahin hui lekin paanchaven gendbaaj ko lekar thodi si pareshaani ho rahi he
 So we included Ravinder Jadeja in the team
 'team par thakaan haaavee nahipakistan ke purv captain jahir abbaas ne kaha tha ki bhartiya team par thakaan haaavee he, lekin dhoni ne isse inkaar kiya
 He said, 'it is difficult to say
 ham is bare main soch hi nahin sakate
 We know how many days we have to play another match and how to relax the body
 'kharaab pradarshan ke liye ipel bhi jimmedaar nahindhoni ne sunil gavaskar or imran khan kii is baat ko bhi nakaar diya ki bharat ke kharaab pradarshan ke liye ipel jimmedaar he
 He said, 'you can blame anyone

 In the last one month, onion prices have increased almost 3 times, so even expensive tomatoes are not taking the name of being cheaper
 thok vikritaon kii maane to diwaali tak pyaaz kii keemton main giravat nahin aegi
 Meaning expensive onions will make you cry more in the coming days
 pyaaz kii tarah tamaato ke daam main bhi giravat ke asaar behad kam he
 The situation is that the people of Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad are turning to the vegetable markets of the capital instead of retail vendors
 kyon bad rahe hai pyaaz, tamaato ke daam
 Aajtak's team reached Ghazipur mandi to find out the reason for increase in prices of onion and tomato in vegetable markets
 gajipur mandi main pyaaz madhya pradesh, nasik, pune or rajasthan se aata he
 Similarly, tomatoes come from Maharashtra, Bangalore and Himachal Pradesh, from where the retailers in many areas of East Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida buy onions and tomatoes
 gajipur mandi main pyaaj kaa thok vyapaar karne vaale mukesh kumaar ne bataaya ki banpar utpaadan ke baad empi main pyaaj do rupye kilo tak pahunch gaya tha, hangaame or pradarshan ke baad shivaraj sarkaar ne 8 rupye kilo kharidne kaa elaan kiya, lekin ab yahi pyaaj aam logon ke aansu nikaalane ko taiyaar he
 It is not that the onion yield or arrival is low, but the onion reaching the mandis is coming expensive from the farmers, after which the onion is now sold in the market for 20 to 24 rupees per kg due to transportation charge, loading charge, etc
 Used to be
 gajipur mandi ke mahasachiv or tamaato ke thok vikreta jagadish bajaj ke mutabik barsaat kii vajah se tamaato kii kai fasalein karaab huin
 Only in Himachal, tomato is grown on the mountain, so the crop is coming from there

 According to the survey, if the oil, food and fertilizer subsidy reaches the poor in the right way, then the waste of subsidy can be stopped and the remaining funds can be used for new investment in agriculture
 survey main daawa kiya gaya he ki saal 2014-15 main anaaj utpaadan beete 5 saal ke ausat se 85 lakh ton zyada rahane kii ummid he
 
 
 That is, food grains will be above average in the mandis in the new year, due to which it will be easy to control inflation

 While Congress MP Rajiv Shukla said that according to the old estimate, the expected economic growth rate should be 6 or 8 percent

 The survey also states that the government has the strength to implement economic reforms, which is necessary for any major reforms
 lekin sawaal he ki jab se endie sarkaar satta main ai he uskaa aarthik sudhaar kaa agenda atka padaa he
 Due to opposition from the opposition in the Rajya Sabha, the government has not been able to move forward on many important bills related to economic reform

 Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MP Prasanna Acharya raised the Sabarimala temple case
 unhone kaha ki jis tarah se sabarimala mandir main mahilaon ko pravesh se roka ja rahaa he
 From that, it seems that in which country we are living, where the freedom of women is being taken away in the name of tradition
 prasann acharya centre sarkaar par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki koi batayega hamen sabarimala main mahilaon ke pravesh ko lekar kya ho rahaa he
 The way in which women are protesting against the entry of women in the temple, it is clear that the Modi government is giving the slogan of 'beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' just for show
 ek taraf centre sarkaar teen talaak ko lekar sakriy dikhti he
 Exactly, she is turning her back on the Sabarimala case
 isse saaf hota he ki mahilaon kii aazaadee ye sarkaar bhi nahin chaahati he
 He said, 'one way you say' Save the daughter, teach the daughter 'and the other way stop the mother, daughter, sister from going to the Sabarimala temple
 'bijedy saansad ne congress par bhi sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki sabarimala maamle par centre sarkaar ke saath-saath congress kaa ravaiya bhi shaq paidaa karata he
 Because we all respect the order of the Supreme Court, but who is responsible for what is happening in Sabarimala? The way the women are protesting there, it is clear that the intention of the government is not clear
 prasann acharya ne kaha, 'hamen shame aani chahie ki mahilaayein mandir jaati hai to ham uskaa shuddhikaran karne lagate hai, hamen aatm samiksha karnaa chahie ki ham kis disha main ja rahe hai
 While announcing his support for upper caste reservation, the BJD MP said that the government's policy on this is correct, but the intention arises because the government has brought the bill just before the election
 darasal, kerala main 2 janvari se bade paimaane par hinsa bhadak gai thi, kyonki do mahilaon ne sabarimala mandir main pravesh kiya tha

 But despite this, the temple retained the ban, after which two women named Bindu and Kanakadurga entered the temple for the first time on 2 January
 isse pehle supreme court ne apane faisle main saaf kaha tha ki har umr varg kii mahilaayein ab mandir main pravesh kar sakengi
 Because woman's place in our culture is respected
 yahaan mahilaon ko devi kii tarah puja jaataa he or mandir main pravesh se roka ja rahaa he
 This is not acceptable

 Mumbai - 59 The great American writer, inventor, intellectual, revolutionary Thomas Penn had said that the harder the struggle, the greater the victory
 or is baat ko sabit kiya siddarth jain ne
 The comments siddarth jain ko is baar bhartiya civil sarvice pariksha main gyarahavaan sthaan mila he wo bhi apane paanchave prayaas main
 Siddhartha, who believed in karma alone, was never disappointed by his failure
 ve har baar ye sochate the ki kuch to kami hogi jo main baar baar asafal ho rahaa hoon or phir aatmamanthan karke, phir se mehnat karne main jute jate
 Siddartha is also a Chartered Accountant and Company Secretariat by profession and has also been an Assistant Manager Finance in Coal India Limited
 unke paas wo sab kuch tha jisaki aap kalpana karte hai
 
 acchhee padhai, sarkari naukari par phir bhi wo nahin tha jiskaa unhone bachapan se sapana dekha tha
 Born in the small town of Sawai Madhopur in Rajasthan, Siddartha is the youngest of his siblings
 unki barahavin tak kii padhai vahiin se hui he or mata pita sarkari naukari main the
 His mother is still a teacher in a government school in Surwal, a village in Rajasthan
 siddarth jab chote the tab roj skool jate samay jila adhikari ke daftar ke baahar se guzarate the or bheed dekha karte the
 They felt that something is different, so many people who come here in this job and hope that their work will be done
 dhire dhire ye khyaal itnaa dil main samaa gaya kii unhone faisla liya ki wo ek civil sarvent banenge or samaaj main badlaav laaenge
 Siddharth made preparations with the job but this year he left the job to pay full attention
 siddarth sabase pehle mahila suraksha par kaam karnaa chaahate hai
 He told NDTV that when his sister was late in returning, his mother was upset, so he thinks that every mother would think that the daughter should come home on time and they want to bring such a change in the system
 Everyone feels safe
 siddarth kaa maananaa he ki ye pariksha kathin he paas karnaa par naammumkin nahin
 They say that to pass this exam, you do not need bookish knowledge, but you have to make your thinking and understanding yourself on important issues
 jab unase poocha ki unhone is prayaas main kya sudhara to unhone bataaya ki kisaanon kii samasya ko samajhane ke liye unhone kitaaben to padhin par naukari ke dauraan jab ve maharashtra ke vidarbha main the tab vaqt milane par khud jaakar kisaanon se baat karte taaki jamini sachai kaa pataa chal sake or is baar unhone koi kasar nahin chodi apane sapane ko puraa karne ke liye or ant main apane lakshya ko paa liya
 He improved the way he wrote his answers and also took a lot of help from his friends so that there is no aspect where there is a shortage
 kisi ke thik hi kaha he kii jivan kii ladaai main hameshaa shaktishaalee yaa tej vyakti nahin jeetta , jeetta wo he jo sochaa he kii wo jeet saktaa he
 Siddartha Jain has got eleventh place in the Indian Civil Service Examination this time in his fifth attempt
 keval karm par vishwaas karne vaale siddarth apni asafalataa se kabhi niraash nahin hue 
 Every time he used to think that there will be something missing which i am failing again and again and then, after introspection, i would start working hard again
 siddarth peshey se ek chartered acountint or company secreteriet bhi he or saath hi saath kol india limited main assistant manager finance bhi rah chuke hai 
 They had everything you imagine
 
 Good studies, yet he was not what he had dreamed of since childhood
 rajasthan ke chote se shahar savai madhopur main janme siddarth apane bhai bahanon main sabase chote hai
 He studied up to his twelfth from there and his parents were in government jobs
 unki maa aaj bhi rajasthan ke ek gaanv surwal ke sarkari skool main teacher hai
 When Siddartha was young, he used to go outside the district officer's office every day while going to school and see the crowd
 unako lagata tha ki kuch to alag he is naukari main jo itane log yahaan aate hai or ummid lagate hai kii unka kaam ho jayega
 Gradually, this thought was so much in my heart that he decided that he would become a civil servant and bring change in the society
 siddharth ne naukari ke saath main taiyaari kii parantu is saal unhone puraa dhyaan padhai ko dene ke liye naukari bhi chhod di thi
 Siddartha wants to work on women's safety first
 unhone NDTV ko bataaya ki jab unki bahano ko lautne main der ho jaati thi to maa pareshaan ho jaati thi, isliye unako lagata he kii har maa ye hi sochati hogi kii beti vakt se ghar aa jaye or wo system main aisa badlaav laana chaahate hai kii sabhi surakshit mahsoos kare
 Siddartha believes that passing this test is difficult but not impossible
 wo kehete hai ki is exam ko paas karne ke liye aapako kitaabi gyaan nahin chahie balki aapako apni soch or samaj ahm muddon par khud banani hogi
 When asked what he had improved in this endeavor, he said that he read books to understand the farmers' problem, but when he was in Vidarbha, Maharashtra, he used to go and talk to the farmers himself when he got time on the job so that the ground truth This time he came to know and this time he left no stone unturned to fulfill his dream and finally reached his goal
 unhone apane uttar likhe ke tareeke ko bahut sudhara ausapane doston se bhi kaaphi madad lee taaki koi pahalu aisa na ho jaha koi kami rah jaae
 Someone has rightly said that a powerful or fast person does not always win in the battle of life, he is the one who has thought that he can win

 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kaa teen divasiy 'bhavishya kaa bharat' kaarykram samaapt ho chukaa he
 Through this program, Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat himself revealed that the RSS is a cultural organization as well as a political organization
 kaarykram ke aakhri din bhagwat se tamaam raajnneetik sawaal puche gaye jiskaa jawaab unhone raajnneetik tareeke se hi dena munasib samajha
 Actually, the Sangh expanded significantly in the Modi government but did not get the acceptance that the RSS expected
 lihaaja sangh pramukh ne badalte maahaul ke hisaab se aresas ko ek samaveshi sanghathan ke taur par pesh kiya
 This is a matter of concern for the country's oldest Dal Congress
 jisase nipatane ke liye congress ne faujee anushaasan or jazbe kii pahchaan rakhane vaale sevadal ke vistaar kii yojana banaai he
 Sevadal was founded by a Maharashtrian Brahmin Dr
 narayan subbarao hardikar ne 1923 main hindustan sevadal ke taur par kii thi
 In 1925, exactly two years after the establishment of the Sevadal, another Maharashtrian Brahmin Dr
 keshav baliram headgavar ne aresas kii sthapana kii
 Fewer people would know that Hedgewar and Hardiker were each other's classmates and were active together in the early days
 lekin, hardikar par mahatma gandhij kaa prabhaav tha to headgavar ‘hindu raashtra’ kii sankalpana lekar aage badhen
 The story of Sevadal and Sangh is also similar to 'rabbit and Turtle'
 aazaadee ke baad sevadal ke paas apana koi lakshya nahin rahaa
 Due to being neglected in the Congress, its role became a Utsavi concession
 jabaki, sangh apane hindu raashtra ke sapane ko saakaar karne kii disha main kachua gati se aage badhata rahaa
 The Sangh is the mother organization of the BJP
 lekin iske thik vipareet congress matra sanghathan he sevadal anushangik
 Before joining the Congress, training of Seva Dal was necessary
 indira gandhi ne rajeev gandhi kii congress main entry sevadal ke madhyam se hi karai thi
 But forgetting the organization became the style of Congress every time it got power
 congress jab-jab pareshaani main rahi, sevadal ke sipaahi aage aate rahe
 After Operation Blue Star, when it was difficult for the Congress to work in Punjab, Sevadal worked as an organization in the midst of violence
 jab 1977 main satta se baahar hote hi indira gandhi kii suraksha kam kar di gai to sevadal ne choubison ghante unki suraksha kii
 The responsibility of the Seva Dal was increased even after Rajiv Gandhi was out of power
 aaj jab congress aise hi sankat kaa saamana kar rahi he, to use phir se apni jadon kii taraf jhaankne kii jarurat pad rahi he
 Aajtak from its chief organizer or national president Lalji Desai to understand the program of this expansion of the Seva Dal
 in ne khaas baatcheet kii he
 Sewa Dal Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat had said in the three-day Future of India program that we respect the tricolor, but saffron is our guru
 sangh kii shakha main or shaharon-kasbon main hone vaale prabhatapheri main aresas ke kaaryakarta apane kandhe par danda lekar chalate hai
 Lalji Desai, chief organizer of the Seva Dal, says that Danda is a symbol of violence
 sangh ke log bhagava jhande ke samaksh aadha salaam karte hai jabaki sevadal desh ke tirange ko puraa salaam karata he
 They have black caps on our heads and white on our heads
 kaala rang gusse kaa pratik he, jabaki safed shanti kaa pratik he
 Lalji Desai says the tricolor gives the message of renunciation and brotherhood while saffron represents only one religion
 congress kii taraf se sevadal ke vyapak vistaar ko hari jhandi mil gai he
 Lalji Desai says that in the coming December, on the day of the establishment of the Sevadal, Sevadal will start its campaign against the Sangh with the flag Rohan at 5,000 important places in the country
 desai kehete hai ki ham sangh ke danda kaa jawaab jhande se denge
 With the changing times, the structure of the Seva Dal is also changing
 From the organizational perspective, the structure of Seva Dal and the Union is almost one of a kind
 lekin sevadal ab apni youth wing or mahila wing bhi khadaa kar rahaa he
 Lalji Desai says that Seva Dal's organization is present in every block / block and village
 deshbhar main hamaare sadsy hai jo niyaswaarth bhav se jude hai
 Millions of people are just emotionally connected
 ye aise log hai jo satta ke liye sanghathan main nahin aae
 Lalji Desai says that there will be a big change in the time coming in the Seva Dal
 ab tak congress ke kaarykram main anushaasan kii jimmedaari tak simit kar diya gaya sevadal ek baar phir se janajagran or netritv nirmaan kaa kaary karne ja rahaa he or yah prakriya ab satat chalegi
 The effect of which will be seen in the upcoming assembly and Lok Sabha elections
 rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav ke baad loksabhaa chunaav par bhi jorsaal ke ant main hone vaale madhyapradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan ke vidhansabha chunaav main takreeban 75 siton par congress ne vishesh ranneeti taiyaar kii he
 The Congress Sevadal is going to conduct door-to-door campaigning in those seats where the Congress has been continuously defeated in the last several elections to surround the BJP veterans
 ghar ghar dastak dene ke is abhiyaan ke liye sanghathan kii taraf se madhyapradesh kii aisi 30, rajasthan kii 25 or chhattisgarh main 20 siton kaa chunaav kiya ja rahaa he, jahansevadal kii vishesh rup se prashikshit timen congress ke liye prachaar karengi
 Lalji Desai says that till the Lok Sabha elections, the work of extension of Sevadal will be completed
 jiske baad loksabhaa kii kuch siton par vyapak or kuch siton par ghanisht prachaar abhiyaan chalaaya jayega
 There was a time when the Seva Dal acted as a bridge between the Congress and the public
 aaj bhi iske zyaadaatar sadsy madhyam varg se aate hai or is varg kii nabj se parichit hai
 The Seva Dal prepared a special plan for Modi's Kashi: On August 9, on the 'august Revolution Day', the tricolor trip took place in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's parliamentary constituency Varanasi
 jisamen kaashi or pradesh ke netritv ke saath sevadal ke rashtriya netritv taur par lalji desai bhi shaamil the
 Lalji Desai, the chief organizer of the Seva Dal, says that in 1936, when the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was just 11 years old and studying the story of Hindu nationalism, the seva Dal and Congress workers built the huge temple of Bharat Mata in Kashi
 jiskaa locarpan swayan mahatma gandhi ne kiya
 Lalji Desai says that this time the Sangh and BJP will not be allowed to do hindu-muslim, cremation-burial and diwali-ramadan
 ham door tu door campan karenge or jab-jab ve janata ko bhatakaane kii koshish karenge sevadal unhen mudde par laane kaa kaam karegaa
 Desai says the Seva Dal will cooperate in coordination with the Congress up to the booth level
 iske liye har 10 booth par sevadal kaa bada padaadhikari hoga jiske neeche 10 madhya str ke kaaryakarta honge or unke neeche 10 or kaaryakarta honge
 In this sense, a pyramid structure of the Seva Dal will work at every booth
 dar kii raajnneeti karata he sanghasangh se do saal pehle sthapit sevadal vistaar or takat ke lihaaj se kaaphi peeche rah gaya
 After the independence, when Congress-led governments were formed in the country, the leaders felt that what is the need of the Seva Dal when they are doing service work themselves
 is sawaal ke jawaab main lalji desai kehete hai ki yah baat sahi he ki sevadal kii bhoomika ko simit kar diya gaya
 After Rajiv Gandhi's death, the Seva Dal was not taken care of
 sangh ke vistaar lalji desai kehete hai ki kisi achche kaary ke liye logon ke ikattha karne main mushkil aati he
 But if there is a fight somewhere on the road, then people gather without calling
 yah moulik baat he, sangh ne isi kaa phayda uthaaya
 Lalji Desai says that the Sangh adopted this method after independence
 jisamen logon ke bich afvaah failaayaa gaya ki hindu khatre main he, bharat mata khatre main
 When fear prevails in people, then ask them to gather
 unhone kaha ki abhi america main vishwa hindu congress kaarykram main sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne sher or kute kii misaal dekar logon ko ekajute hone kaa sandesh diya
 Desai says that every worker of the Seva Dal will go door to door and expose the politics behind the fear
 desai ne ummid jataai ki janata satya ko samajhegi or satya ke saath khadi hogi

 India's fight against the most wanted terrorist Maulana Masood Azhar is very old
 pakistan kii god main baitha aatanki masood ajahar lagaataar bharat ke khilaaf aag ugalta rahaa he
 New intrigues were hatched against India for the day
 usne bharat main kai badi aatanki vaardaaton ko anjaam diya
 But Pakistan always tried to save him
 hairaan karne vaali baat he ki jab-jab bharat ne sanyukt raashtra main masood ajahar ko antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit karne kii maang uthaai to keval china ne bharat ke prastaav kaa virodh kiya
 That too not once but four times
 lekin pulavama hamale ke baad puri duniya bharat ke saath khadi najar ai
 All countries openly condemned the Pulwama attack
 aise main china par bhi dabaav bad gaya tha
 So now India has won after a long battle
 sanyukt raashtra ne bharat ke dushman ko atanrarashtriya aatanki ghoshit kar hi diya
 The US, France and Britain continued to support the proposal of declaring Masood Azhar as a terrorist, but China was always impeding it
 amarika ne bhi ise pratishtha kaa sawaal bana liya tha
 India too was continuously engaged and the result was seen 75 days after the Pulwama attack
 aapako silsilewar bataate hai ki bharat ne kaise is aatanki ko yahaan tak pahunchaaya
 1 May 2019 1267 Sanctions Committee declared Azhar a global terrorist after China lifted its ban on US, UK and France proposals
 30 april 2019china ne kaha ki sanyukt raashtra dwaara ajahar ko vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit karne kii prakriya main kuch pragati hui he or use ummid he ki yah vivadaspad mudda thik tarah se hal hoga
 On April 3, 2019, on the threat of using "all means available" to declare the US Jaish chief as a global terrorist, China said that Washington is complicit in the matter and it is not right for peace and stability in South Asia
 28 march 2019america ne france or britain ke samarthan se pakistan main sakriy aatankwaadi samooh ke pramukh ko kaali suchi main daalane ke liye sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main sidhe ek masauda prastaav pesh kiya
 March 13, 2019: Once again, China did not allow the attempt to blacklist the Jaish chief
 ajahar ko ek vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit karaane kaa pichley 10 varsh main yah chauthaa prayaas tha
 27 February 2019 US, UK France introduced a new proposal to declare Azhar a global terrorist in the UN Security Council
 varsh 2017pi3 deshon ne bhi aisa hi ek prastaav pesh kiya
 But China, which received a veto in the Security Council, did not allow this resolution to be passed
 varsh 2016bharat ne ek baar phir pi3 (america, britain or france) ke samarthan ke saath sanyukt raashtra kii 1267 pratibandh samiti main ajahar par pratibandh lagane kaa prastaav pesh kiya
 In 2009, India moved a resolution declaring Azhar as a global terrorist, which would have banned him from traveling anywhere in the world, would have banned his property and would have been subjected to arms embargo
 lekin china ne is kadam ko roak laga di

 ' Even though the name of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi as the prime ministerial candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been coming to the fore, but the Shiv Sena, the oldest ally of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), also gave the Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 Taking a sideline, there is a new bet in which Sushma Swaraj has been described as most qualified for the post of Prime Minister
 unke is bayaan ne bhaajapa main hi ek tarah se khalabali machaa di he
 In fact, Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray on Sunday praised Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sushma Swaraj and said that she would be the most suitable as the next Prime Minister of the country
 party ke mukhpatr 'saamana' main chaar kishton main prakashit hone vaale unke saakshaatkaar kii teesri kadi ravivaar ko prakashit hui, jisamen unhone kaha, "vartmaan main, sheersh pad ke liye sushamaa atyant upyukt hai
 i think she will prove to be a fast-paced prime minister
 " Taking a jibe at the hopes of other key contenders of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) like Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar or Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, Thackeray said, "there is a long queue of prime ministerial contenders
 keval sushamaa is pad kii laayak hai, budhimaan hai or pradhanmantri pad ke liye sarvotkrisht pasand maani ja sakati hai
 " thakare ne varisht bhaajapa netaa laalkrishna adwani dwaara haal hi main kii gai is bhavishyavaanee ko bhi spasht rup se darkinar kiya ki desh kii agali sarkaar gaiyr samprag (sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan) or gaiyr rajg partiyaan banaaengi
 He said, "he (advani) is nine months younger than me
 main umr main haalanki unase bada hum or mujhe bolne kaa adhikaar he, phir bhi main mahasoos karata hum ki unke khilaaf kuch bhi bolnaa kathin he
 What can we expect from a person like him? Wonder why he said such a thing
 
 
 " When asked about the prime ministerial contenders like Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mayawati, Sharad Pawar or Jayalalithaa of the Third Front, Thackeray dismissed them all, saying that they only want a 'chair'
 unhone kaha ki in netaaon main se prayek ke pichley ricard par gaur kiya jaae to paaenge ki inamen se kisi ne bhi desh ke liye koi vishisht yogadan nahin diya he
 Asked whether the Shiv Sena and BJP have a coalition in Maharashtra and whether it is 'strong', Thackeray said in diplomatic terms that this would not be an appropriate word to explain this alliance in the changed circumstances
 unhone jawaab diya, "maujuuda soch alag he
 There is personal and political enmity between the parties involved in the NDA and their leaders
 pehle rajg ke paas atal bihari vaajapeyi ke rup main ek prabhaavshaalee netritv tha
 He has no such leader now
 main yah baat samooche rajg ke bare main kah rahaa hum, sirf bhaajapa ke sandarbh main nahin
 "comments bhaajapa netaa balbir punj ne thakare ke bayaan kaa swaagat karte hue kaha ki bhaajapa apane astitv ke liye kisi ek parivaar vishesh par ashrith nahin he
 He said, "we welcome what Bala Saheb said
 " BJP National Vice President Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, "it is a matter of pleasure for us that we have many leaders who are capable, capable and effective as the Prime Minister
" party main is masale par charchaa hogi or upyukt samay par naam kii ghoshnaa kii jaaegi
 " darasal, shiv sena pramukh bal thakare ne ravivaar ko bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) netaa sushamaa swaraj kii prashansa kii or kaha ki desh ke agle pradhanmantri ke rup main vah sabase upyukt hongi
 The third episode of his interview, published in four installments in the party mouthpiece 'saamana', was published on Sunday, in which he said, "currently, Sushma is highly suited for the top post
 mujhe lagata he, vah ek tej-tarraar pradhanmantri sabit hongi
 " bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar yaa gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi jaise rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) ke anya pramukh daavedaaron kii ummiido par pani pherate hue thakare ne kaha, "pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaaron kii lambi qatari he
 Only Sushma deserves this post, is intelligent and can be considered the best choice for the post of Prime Minister
 " Thackeray also blatantly ignored the recent prediction made by senior BJP leader LK Advani that the next government of the country would form non-upa (united Progressive Alliance) and non-nda parties
 unhone kaha, "vah (adwani) mujhase nau maheene chote hai
 Even though i am older than him and i have the right to speak, i still feel that it is difficult to speak anything against him
 un jaise vyakti se ham kya apeksha rakh sakate hai? aashcharya he ki unhone aisi baat kyon kahi
 
 
 " tisare morche ke mulaayam singh yadav, mayawati, sharad pavaar yaa jayalalita jaise pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaaron ke bare main puche jane par thakare ne yah kahkar in sabhi ko khaarij kar diya ki ye keval 'kursi' chaahate hai
 He said that if we look at the past record of each of these leaders, then none of them has made any specific contribution to the country
 yah puche jane par ki maharashtra main shiv sena or bhaajapa kaa gathbandhan he or kya yah 'majboot' he, thakare ne kootnithik shabdon main kaha ki badali hui paristhitiyon main is gathbandhan kii vyakhya karne ke liye yah upyukt shabd nahin hoga
 He replied, "current thinking is different

 aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ke sena ke lekar uthe vivaad ke baad sah sar kaarywah dattatreya hosbale ne bhi unki ore safai di he
 This is the second time such cleanliness has come from the Sangh at the top level in two days
 aresas ke sah sar kaarywah dattatreya hosbale ne patna main safai dete hue kaha, 'sangh pramukh ne kaha tha ki yadi samvidhan ijaajat de or desh ko agar jarurat hogi to do-teen din main anushaasit logon ko taiyaar kar sakate hai jabaki sena ko ek jawan ko taiyaar karne main chah-saat maheene lagate hai
 After releasing a book on the life of the former RSS chief in Patna, Dattatreya said that the Sangh chief had not compared it to the army
 unka kahana tha ki saamaanya logon ko anushaasan seekhney main samay lagegaa, lekin swayamsevak pehle se hi anushaasan main rahete hai to unhen taiyaar karne main zyada vakt nahin lagata he
 Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday, during a program in Muzaffarpur, compared the army to the volunteers, and after this the controversy started
 unhone kaha tha ki desh ko agar hamaari jarurat pade or hamaara samvidhan or kanoon ijaajat de ham turant taiyaar ho jaaenge
 Explaining the quarrels of the volunteers, the Sangh chief also said that it will take 6-7 months for the army to be ready, but we will be ready in two to three days, because our discipline is like this
 iske baad tamaam dalon ne ise sena kaa apmaan bataaya haalanki bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne sangh pramukh kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki agar koi sanghathan desh kii raksha karnaa chahta he to isamen vivaad nahin hona chahie
 Seeing the escalation of the dispute, the Sangh also presented a clarification on this statement on Monday
 sangh ke pravaktaa manmohan vaidya ne kaha tha ki sangh pramukh ke bayaan ko galat tareeke se prastut kiya gaya he
 He said that 'bhagwat ji had said that if the Indian Army takes 6 months to prepare the general society if the situation comes and is accepted by the constitution, then the Sangh volunteers can prepare the Indian Army in 3 days, because the volunteers Discipline is practiced
 manmohan vaidya ne kaha ki yah sena ke saath tulana nahin thi par saamaanya samaaj or swayamsevakon ke bich main thi, donon ko bhartiya sena ko hi taiyaar karnaa hoga
 The RSS is hopeful that after another clarification from the Sangh, this dispute may now be cleared

 ) In the US and Europe, due to i-scanning technology, millions of people only see in their mobile phones and make transactions with their bank accounts
 is technology kii shuruyaat ab bhartiya bainkon main jorshor se ho rahi he
 For this, some banks have started using i-scanner technology to open bank accounts of new customers using Aadhaar card
 jaaniye kaise kaam karegaa aankh se bank acount or kaise badal jaaegi banking1
 Until a while ago, the bank had to resort to the signature of customers to prove the identity of its customers
 bank se paisa nikaanle, check se pement karne or draft banavaane ke liye bhare jane vaale form par graahak ke signechar ko bank apane record se milan karata tha
 The bank used to ask you to re-signatures on signature manipulation
 bank main signechar milaane kaa yah kaam usee form main kiye signechar se kiya jaataa tha jise graahak ne bank acount khulavaate samay bank main jamaa kiya tha
 2
 bank main computerigeshan ke baad aapke isi signechar ko bank ne digitalis karke apni sabhi shakhaon main pahunchaa diya
 Due to which all banks allowed customers to go to any branch and do banking
 pehle manual signechar milan karne ke kaam ko ab bank ke network par maujuud aapkaa digital signechar se kiya jaataa tha or bank aashwast hokar aapke banking request ko puraa kar detaa tha
 3
 computerigeshan ke baad bank ke atm, debit or credit card ke saath-saath internet banking kii shuruyaat hui
 In this era of banking, banks introduced passwords and pins to identify customers
 password or pin ke istemaal se bank aashwast rahete hai ki kisi bhi tareeke se banking kaa sahaara lenaa vaala graahak apana unic password or pin kaa istemaal kar surakshit rahata he
 However, the risk of their hacking is always on the bank and the customer
 4
 After this, you will be aware of the use of fingerprints to prove someone's identity
 ab duniya bhar ke bank aaidentity sabit karne ke liye fingerprint se ek kadam aage nikalakar graahakon ke aankh kii putali kaa sahaara lene ja rahe he
 However, banks will prove your identity by not logging samples of the pupil of the eye, by resorting to blood arteries running in the white part of the eye
 5
 After reaching the iris sample of the customers eye in the bank, customers will need to look at the verification window in their bank app for a few seconds
 bank main maujuud sample or aapke ap ke jariye bheje ja rahe sample kaa milan hote hi bank kaa computer aapaki aaidentity ko sabit kar legaa or aapako tranjaction karne ke liye maanya kar degaa
 So, once the eye sample is matched, you can do the balance check, transfer money and pay any bills in your bank account
 6
 Bank customers will have to open bank accounts by using Aadhaar number to provide proof of identity through the eyes
 acount kholte vakt bank ek baar phir aapaki aankh kaa iris sample record karegaa or uskaa aapke aadhaar number ke saath milan karegaa
 Private sector bank DCB in India has completed the opening of 200 bank accounts in its 10 branches in small town and rural areas on this basis under its pilot program
 iske saath hi isi bank ne deshbhar main aadhaar number par aadhaarit atm mashin lagaana shuru kar diya he
 Currently, the bank customer has to give his fingerprint to withdraw from these ATM machines

 The Indian team has made a tremendous comeback in the Centurion Test on the strength of captain Virat Kohli's century

 But Kohli has given a befitting reply to critics with his bat
 centurian test main viraat ne apana 21waan shatak jadaa, isi ke saath kohli ne dakshin africa kii jameen par do yaa usase shatak lagane ke maamle main bhi lambii chalaang maari he
 Kohli's number is now after Sachin
 vahiin kisi bhi bhartiya captain kaa yah africa main sarvaadhik score he, isse pehle purv captain mahendra singh dhoni (90 ran) ke naam yah uplabdhi thi
 Let me tell you that this is Virat's first Test century in 2018, in 2017 he scored 5 centuries, including 3 double centuries

 Now Virat has given a befitting reply to Sehwag by scoring a magnificent century
 ye bhi padhein
 
 
 In addition to Trollaviru, the fans fiercely questioned the exclusion of Shikhar Dhawan, after the captain's ladle Rohit was flopped
 unhone kaha tha ki har baar dhawan ko hi bali kaa bakra banaaya jaataa he, kyon har baar shikhar par hi talwaar latakati he
 It is wrong to dismiss him only after an innings
 shikhar dhawan ko chhod kar diggajon ne bhubaneshwar ko team se baahar karne par naaraazgi vyakt kii thi
