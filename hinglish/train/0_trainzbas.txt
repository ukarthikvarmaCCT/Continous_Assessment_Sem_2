 The people of Surat will vote on the Prime Minister of the country through a voting machine that looks like an electronic voting machine (EVM)

 Alipapuri Ganesh Mandal organizer Dilip Bhai Lakhpati, who conducted the voting, said, 'in this program we will try to tell the public what the survey is, what is the opinion poll

 The result will come on 18th
 'voting mashin ko banane vaale kaa naam he mashood vohara
 Vohra said, "when the organizers presented this concept to me and said that we can do something so that public opinion can be achieved, then this machine came to my mind

 Volunteers will go out by voting one by one, so that there is no problem of multiple votes

 ' The validity of the electoral bond case was heard in the Supreme Court today
 chif justise ranjan gogoi kii adhyakshata vaali peeth political funding ke liye elactoral bond ke istemaal se judi kai yachikaaon par sunwaayee kar rahi thi
 During the hearing, Prashant Bhushan, counsel for the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), said that the Election Commission has also termed electoral bonds a serious matter
 kul bike bonds main se 90 fisadi bhartiya janata party(bijepi) ko die gaye hai
 During the hearing, Attorney General KK Venugopal asked Prashant Bhushan not to give election speech here
 vahiin isi dauraan chif justise gogoi ne kaha ki abhi to ellection time he
 The court has asked Prashant Bhushan to file an affidavit on the information received from the ITI on the electoral bonds
 is maamle kii agali sunavai 10 april ko hogi
 In this petition, the constitutional validity of the Act FCRA 2016 and 2018, which regularizes donations from political parties from abroad, is challenged
 isse pehle buudhvaar ko hui sunwaayee main centre sarkaar ne apane faisle kaa yah kehete hue bachaav kiya tha ki isse political funding main paardarshita aegi or javabdehi tay hogi
 The Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) is also one of the petitioners who have sought a moratorium on the Electoral Bond Scheme 2018
 elactoral bond par logon kii najar isliye bhi he kyonki supreme court main maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan yah tathy saamne aayaa tha ki netaaon or unke sambandhiyon kaa dhan paanch saal ke bheetar hi 500 fisadi tak badha
 There is currently no restriction on political funding
 political funding par roak lagane ke liye supreme court or dilli hai court main kai yachikaayen abhi lambit hai
 The Central Government, while launching the electoral bonds, claimed that through this bond, there will be transparency in political funding and there will be a ban on black money received as political donations
 nattejey iske ulat rahe
 Earlier, the Central Government was reprimanded in the Supreme Court hearing on March 12
 supreme court ne kaha tha ki centre sarkaar ne political funding par koi sthai system nahin banaaya he
 Electoral bonds are being questioned even before the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 sarkaar ne raajnneetik dalon ko milane vaali funding ko transparent banane ke liye elactoral bearar bond kii shuruyaat kii thi
 But due to lack of knowledge of the source of donations received by political parties, corporate donations got such a boost
 saath hi videsh se milane vaala dhan bhi vaid ho gaya
 Know why questions are being raised on electoral bonds - it is not necessary to mention sources
 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley wrote in January 2018 that the scheme of electoral bonds has been brought in political funding system to prevent rigging and transparency in financial matters
 lekin political fending kis tarah se jutai gai he iskaa zikr karnaa jaruri nahin he
 Changes in the Finance Bill 2017 Some changes were made under the Electoral Bond Finance Act 2017 which damaged political funding
 janpratinidhitiv kanoon kii dhara 29 si main sanshodhan kiya gaya
 It was said that funding from electoral bonds would be kept out of the purview of the Election Commission
 chunaav ayog ne in badlaavon par aapatti jataate hue vidhi mantralay ko badlaav ke liye kaha tha
 -the political parties that have power in their hands are benefiting more from the electoral bonds being given to the ruling party
 association for democratic riforms ke mutabik saal 2017-18 main elactoral bond ke dwaara 222 karod rupee kaa chanda diya gaya tha
 210 crore (94) to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 5%), congress ko 5 karod rupye or anya dalon ko 7 karod rupye mili
 The obligatory government of KYC norm while issuing electoral bond notifications in January 2018 had also clarified that the purchaser would have to fully fulfill the Know Your Customers (KYC) norm and pay through the bank account
 - farji companiyon ko milegaa badhavacompany act 2013 main kaha gaya tha ki koi company ek vittiya varsh main pichley teen saal ke apane ausat kul munaafe ke 7
 Can not give political donations of more than 5%
 lekin niyam badalte hue funding ko limitales kar diya gaya
 Companies are also exempted from concealing in their books which party they have donated
 chunaav ayog ne is sabhi badlaavon par aapatti kii he
 This has increased the risk that fake companies are formed only to fund political parties
 chunaav kii har khabar milegi sidhe aapke inbox main

 As soon as the assembly elections are over, Delhi has started reverberating with promises
 aam aadmi party, bhartiya janata party or congress teenon hi apane-apane andaaj main vaadon kii thali paros rahe hai
 It is also clear that the promises of the three parties are more or less the same, if there is a difference, in terms of presenting them
 or usase mjedaar baat yah ki yahi ve sab vaade hai jo pichley kai chunaav se dilli ke aasmaan par yahaan ke bade kudagharon par udaye vaali chilon kii tarah mandara rahe hai
 Here we see some promises hitting the hard ground of truth - cheap electricity - this promise is the most beloved promise of the Aam Aadmi Party
 arvind kejariwal ise tab se pakade hai, jab aam aadmi party vajood main bhi nahin ai thi
 From the beginning, the party has been saying that it will reduce electricity bills by 30 per cent and there is no need to provide any additional subsidy for this
 apni 49 din kii sarkaar main aap ne yah kiya bhi, lekin yah kaam karne ke liye use sabsidi kaa sahaara lenaa padaa
 The party then said that it was an immediate relief, but soon he would make such a system that electricity would become cheaper without subsidy
 darasal aam aadmi party yah vaada 2010 main ai dilli state electricity regulatory kamishan kii ek report ke aadhaar par karti he
 It was said in the report that the electricity companies are charging more money and if they work at a reasonable profit, then the cost of electricity can be reduced by 30 percent
 lekin ayog ke chairman badalane ke baad ayog bhi apni is report ko bhul gaya
 The nature of this report is very hypothetical
 ho saktaa he ise kaagajon par dikhaaya bhi ja sake lekin jin qaraar or kanoonon ke tahat dilli main bijli bant rahi he, usamen nijee companiyon ko is kaam ke liye raji karnaa takreeban naammumkin he
 In such a situation, if a government comes for five years, then its treasury will be hollow in implementing this promise
 isi tarah bijepi kah rahi he ki 24 ghante bijli denge
 In Delhi anyway, the supply of electricity is like 24 hours, electricity is cut in the same colonies from where bills are not fully received
 dilli ke urja vibhaag kii yah aghoshit niti he
 This has always been accepted by high officials of record in conversation
 pradhanmantri narendra modi jis tarah vailu for mani ke siddhant ke himachati hai, usamen in coloniyon ko 24 ghante bijli milani kathin he
 Because to provide 24-hour power, the poor will have to collect bill strictly, which so far no political party has done
 pani-dilli main pani kii aapurti main lutian kii dilli or baaki ilaakon main jameen-aasmaan kaa asantulan he
 Who will show the courage to remove this imbalance? netaaon ne ab to aisa nahin kiya ki apane hisse kaa pani katkar garibon ko diya ho
 In such a situation, political parties take the plunge to bring water from Haryana through Munak canal
 yah vaada teenon dal kar rahe hai, lekin 15 saal dilli main congress or haryana main 10 congress kii sarkaar rahi phir bhi pani nahin aayaa
 If Haryana gives water, its farmers will face problems
 aise main ab jab centre or haryana main bijepi sarkaar he, tab bhi bijepi ke dilli par kabiz hone kii sarat main jamini sthiti nahin badalegi
 It is a politically difficult decision for the Haryana government to release the water that its farmers have been using for years
 aniyamit coloniyon ko niyamit karnaa-agar aapako dhyaan ho to 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle congress ne yahi daanv chalaa tha
 Then there was a promise to regularize more than 1,000 colonies and Congress President Sonia Gandhi herself distributed provisional certificates to the colonies
 lekin yah vaada puure paanch saal amal main aane kii baat johta rahaa
 Sometimes the MCD or the DDA obstructed it
 had to tab ho gai jab coloniyon kii sahi sankhya par hi vivaad khadaa ho gaya
 Just before this election, BJP has also talked about regularizing more than 900 colonies
 aise main laal fitaashahee is vaade ko kab tak amal main laane degi is bare main koi daawa karnaa badbolepan ke alaava kuch nahin hoga
 Ending the contract system of the job - this is a promise that is better if nothing is said about it
 desh ke saare raajnneetik dal apane-apane shashan vaale ilaakon main contract system ko badhaava de rahe hai
 The entire policy of the country has moved towards this system
 aarthik sudhaar to sabase pehle isi taraf dekhte hai
 In such a situation, at least BJP and Congress will not do this work
 rahi baat aap aadmi party kii to vah yah vaada nibhaane ke liye paisa kahaan se laaegi, kyonki dilli ke kharch main badi hissedari ab bhi centre sarkaar se milane vaale paise kii he
 That is, the world of promises should be a million, but the way to implement it is very narrow
 apni kshamta se 5 guna aabaadi ke saath jite is shahar ko abhi bhi jeene ke liye behatar shahar banane ke liye lanbaa safar tay karnaa he
 Maybe, after that long journey, these promises become reality
 lekin philhal to ye jananath kii hakeekat jaise fareb hi hai

 The Madhya Pradesh Congress has released a new list of star campaigners for the Lok Sabha elections, but the name of Vyapam accused Dr
 Gulab Singh Kirar in this list is surprising everyone
 congress kii is suchi main jahaan ek taraf star prachaarkon kii suchi main congress ke rashtriya adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa naam he, purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh samet sonia gandhi, digvijay singh, ashok gahalot or jyotiraditya sindhiya jaise bade naam hai to vahiin suchi main 36wein number par doctor gulab singh kiraar kaa naam isliye chaunkaane vaala he kyonki congress ne shivaraj sarkaar par vyaapman ko lekar jabardast hamalaa bolaa tha or gambhir aarope lagaae the
 Vyapam was also one of the major issues of Congress in the recently held assembly elections
 congress ne kiraar par tatkaaleen mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ke kareebi hone ke aarope lagaae the
 However, Gulab Singh Kirar had joined the Congress in front of Rahul Gandhi in Indore just before the assembly elections last year, which was then disputed and the Congress was quick to deny Kirar's joining the party
 ab star prachaarkon kii suchi main gulab singh kiraar kaa naam aane se congress par sawaal uth rahe hai
 Gulab Singh Kirar is alleged to have wrongly admitted his son to a medical college in the pre-pg examination held in 2011

 The list of 40 star campaigners that Congress has released has named Gulab Singh Kirar at number 36
 kiraar vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan bijepi chhodkar congress main shaamil hue the
 a number of questions also arose on his joining the Congress, as his name came up in the Vyapam scam
 vidhansabha chunaav se pehle congress ne vyaapman ghotaale ko jorshor se uthaaya tha or gulab singh kiraar ko lekar congress ne bijepi par jamkar hamale bole the
 Kirar had also been accused of being close to former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan

 Kirar joined the Congress during the assembly elections and is now named in the list of star campaigners for the Lok Sabha elections

 With the Janta Dal United (JDU) likely to split from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) -led National Democratic (NDA) alliance, the Congress has called the JDU a secular and like-minded party
 congress pravaktaa bhakt charan das ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, jediu samaan vichaar vaala dal he, jiskaa dharmanirpekshata main vishwaas he
 He is in alliance with a party that does not match his ideology
 tippaniyan Bhakta Charan Das's remarks came at a time when party vice president Rahul Gandhi also said in Srinagar that the decision to invite JDU to join the UPA would be made by senior Congress leaders
 jediu endie kaa doosraa sabase bada ghatak he or bijepi ke saath uskaa kareeb 17 varshon kaa saath he
 After Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi was made the chairman of bjp's election campaign committee, there has been growing tussle between JDU and BJP and there is a possibility of the relationship getting to the brink
 das ne kaha, samaan vichaardhaara vaale dal pehle bhi ek saath aae hai or bhavishya main bhi ek saath aa sakate hai
 Political alliances of like-minded forces can take place at any time in the interest of the country
 congress pravaktaa is sawaal ke jawaab ko taal gaye ki bihar main uskaa swabhaavik sahyogi koun he, argedy yaa jediu or inamen se kisko vah zyada dharmanirpeksh maanate hai
 Congress spokesperson Bhakta Charan Das told reporters, JDU is a party with similar views, which believes in secularism
 vah ek aise dal ke saath gathbandhan main he, jisase uski vichaardhaara mail nahin khaati
 The comments bhakt charan das kii yah tippanee aise samay ai he, jab party upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne bhi srinagar main kaha ki jediu ko upie main shaamil hone ke liye aamantrit karne kaa nirnay congress ke varisht netaaon dwaara kiya jayega
 JDU is the second largest constituent of NDA and has nearly 17 years of association with BJP

 The Congress spokesperson avoided the answer to the question as to who is his natural ally in Bihar, RJD or JDU and which of them he considers more secular

 bihar ke purv mukhyamantri lalu prasad yadav ke bade bete tej pratap yadav kaa apni patni se alag hona ab raajnneetik bahes kaa mudda ban gaya he
 The ruling party Janata Dal United MLA Dadan Pehalwan has said that Lalu Yadav's family has spoiled the future of a Yadav girl
 lalu parivaar ke aantarik masale ko uthaate hue vidhayak dadan pahalwaan ne lalu yadav ko is masale se nipatane kaa formula bhi de diya
 He said that due to what Lalu Yadav's son has done, there is a lot of laughter in the Yadav society
 ek ladki ke bhavishya ko lalu ke parivaar ne barbaad kar diya he, aise main unhen jald se jald bihar kii yadavi paramparaon ke tahat aishwarya kii shaadi chote bete tejasvi yadav se kara deni chahie
 Dadan Yadav gave the tradition to JDU MLA from Hawadumraon, Dadan Yadav said that it has been the tradition of Yadavs in Bihar to marry their second son under such circumstances, in such a situation, Lalu Yadav should get his second son from that prestigious family
 To save the daughter's honor, the marriage step of Tejashwi will be taken as soon as possible
 bataa den ki tejpratap yadav ne pichley saal november main aishwarya se talaak lene ke liye court main arji di thi, jis par sunwaayee abhi chal rahi he
 After the divorce application, Tej Pratap Yadav is still living separately from the family and all efforts to convince him are still failing
 ab unke virdohi dal ke vidhayak ne ye nai bahes ched di he
 However, Dadan Yadav has an older relationship with RJD and Lalu Yadav

 User Shaifali Vaidya wrote that when i was going to put my baby to sleep at night, i was thinking about the young children who would never see their father
 rajeev malik naam ke ek yujar ne likhaa ki sirf sarkaar badali he, naa naksali badale naa kashmiri
 Stoning and bloodshed continue
 santosh gupta ne twitor par likhaa ki naksalwad or aatankwaad ke prati jiro tolerance kii niti sirf kaagajon main hi dikhaai degi yaa phir hoga kuch yatharth main bhi hoga
 Tribute meetings are being held at various places for the martyrs of the attack and people are praying for the speedy recovery of the injured soldiers
 rajyasabha main mangalvaar ko sarkaar kii do baar kirakiri hui tathaa vipaksh ke virodh ke kaaran jahaan ucch nyaayalay se sambandhit ek vidheyak ko charchaa ke baad paarit karne kii prakriya taalani padi, vahi duusari ore kapirite sambandhi ek anya vidheyak ko charchaa ke liye sadan main rakhaa hi nahin ja sakaa sadan main aaj ucch nyaayalay vanijyik prabhag vidheyak par charchaa hui
 Taking part in the discussion, not only the members of the opposition but some constituents of the ruling UPA also objected to some of its provisions
 unhone kaha ki vidheyak ko or dhardaar bananaa chahie
 Responding to the discussion, Law Minister Salman Khurshid said that he requested Parliament to postpone the process of passing this bill to consider the suggestions made by various members including CPI leader d Raja
 unhone kaha ki yadi sarkaar ne jaruri samajha to is vidheyak main jaruri sanshodhan kiye jaaenge
 His announcement was welcomed by both the Opposition and the ruling party thumping the tables
 iske fouran baad upasabhapati ke rahamaan khan ne kapirite sambandhi vidheyak ko charchaa ke liye sadan main rakhane ke liye maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri kapil sibbal kaa naam pukaara
 Before Sibal could stand to keep the Copyright Amendment Bill for discussion, jd-u's Shivanand Tiwari raised the question of the system, saying that according to the rules of the House, no member can participate in a discussion on such an issue Conflict of interest
 tiwari ne kaha ki sibbal ke putr sangeet se judi ek prasiddh company ke vakil hai
 Since this is a copyright issue, there is a conflict of interest
 tedepa ke mysorea reddy ne kaha ki is prasiddh company ke vibhinn adaalaton main kapirite se sambandhit kai maamle lambit hai
 In these cases, Sibal's sons are lawyers of that company
 aise main unhen yah vidheyak charchaa ke liye nahin rakhana chahie
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal clarified that this is not a matter of conflict of interest
 hiton kaa takaraav ashrith santanon kii sthiti main hota he
 The ruling party and some other members of the opposition also wanted to speak on the issue, but due to the uproar, Khan adjourned the meeting for 15 minutes at around 4
50 pm
 baithak dobaaraa shuru hone par bhaajapa ke prakaash javdekar ne kaha ki yah vidheyak sibbal ne jab sadan main pesh kiya tha, us samay hiton ke takaraav se sambandhit baat sadasyon ke sangyaan main nahin thi
 Later, when this matter comes to light, we want to raise it in the House
 khan dwaara sadasyon se shant hone kii kai apilen kiye jane ke baavjood hangaamaa jari rahaa jisase sadan kii baithak nirdhaarit samay se pehle hi din bhar ke liye sthagit kar di gai

 mahabuuba ne kashmiri pandit samudaay ke visthapit sadasyon ke saath jammu main hui ek baithak ko sambodhit karte hue yah baat kahi
 He said, 'the Kashmiri Pandit community has contributed significantly to the salvation of Kashmiri society in the past

 India remains troubled by the antics of Pakistan, its other neighboring countries like Afghanistan and Iran are also troubled
 paak kii golabari or apane desh ke aantarik maamalon main pakistani sena ke hastkshep se pareshaan afghanistan se sanyukt raashtra (UN) main isaki shikaayat kii he
 Pakistan has been firing from the border of Afghanistan for the past several years
 iske alaava taliban se rishte badhaakar pakistan uske aantarik maamalon main dakhal bhi de rahaa he
 According to the Economic Times, the Government of Afghanistan has written in a letter on 22 February complaining of 'continuous encroachment in the border of Afghanistan by the Pakistani Army'
 afghanistan sarkaar ne apane letters main sanyukt raashtra se aagrah kiya he ki vah 'is maamle ke prabhavi tareeke se samaadhaan ke liye jaruri kadam uthaae
 According to this letter, Pakistan fired 28,849 shells from the border of Afghanistan between 2012 and 2017
 inaki vajah se afghanistan ke 82 logon kii maut ho gai or 187 log ghayal ho gaye
 This is the second letter written to the UN by the Afghan government within a week
 afghanistan ne pehle letters main is baat kii shikaayat kii thi ki pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan islamabad main taliban ke netaaon ke saath baithak karne ja rahe hai
 In that letter, the Afghan government said, "this meeting represses Afghanistan's peace process and" violates Afghanistan's national sovereignty

 Justice DY Chandrachud said that questions can be raised about the merit of running the suit presented by the Nirmohi Akhara
 dhawan ne kaha ki nirmohi akhaada kis baat ko chunauti de rahe the, vah kya chaahate the, lekin is masale ko uthaanaa mere liye sahi nahin hoga
 Rajiv Dhawan said that evidence and testimony are not sufficient in Nirmohi's case
 dhawan ne kaha ki aap avaidhta ke liye koi karrwai nahin kar sakate or usase laabh dene kii koshish nahin kar sakate, bhale hi aap avaidhta paidaa na karen, phir bhi aap us par vishwaas nahin kar sakate
 Rajeev Dhawan said that there is a difference between trustee and sevadar, Cheviat is not the owner
 jis din se court kaa order aayaa, yani 5 janvari 1950 ko, us din se continiwas rang khatm ho jaataa he
 If Nirmohi Akhara had challenged the appointment of the receiver ahead of time, ie six years ago, then Nirmohi Akhara challenged after the deadline of six years, hence the claim of Nirmohi Akhara would not be made
 inaki yachika khaarij kii jaani chahie
 Rajeev Dhawan said that unlike a trust or trustee, one cannot claim the authority of Shebet
 san 1934 ke baad se muslimon ne vahaan par pravesh nahin kiya, lekin jab aap unhen pravesh nahin karne denge to ve ibaadat kaise karenge? nirmohi akhaade kaa jo sheviat, yani sevadaar kaa daawa he, usko ham saport karte hai, lekin inkaa tital rhite nahin banataa
 If the Nirmohi Akhara has the right of the servitor, even assuming that the right of the servitor lasts for generations, then who is the owner of the property, will the next Fred be considered, then what is the fear of removing the Nirmohi Akhara from the servitor, who owns Or trustee
 maamle main shuukravaar ko sunni vakf board kii taraf se jafarayab jilani bahes karenge uske baad phir se rajeev dhawan bahes karenge
 Former Union Finance Minister and Congress leader p Chidambaram has criticized the Union Budget 2019 presented by the Modi government
 unhone kaha ki rojgaar ko lekar is sarkaar kii niti 'pakoranomics' kii he
 He said that the government never passes the data of NSSO (national Sample Survey Office), but this government is making such an argument
 yah sweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Statistics say that fear of unemployment is the highest in 45 years and the government does not even have an answer
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne bajet par pratikriya dete hue kaha ki ye vot on account nahin balki account for vots tha
 The long speech of the Finance Minister tested patience
 ye ek purna bajet tha jisamen chunavi bhaashan bhi tha jo samvidhan ke niyamon ke khilaaf he
 It is done by the same government which does not believe in return
 unhone kaha ki kisaanon ke liye maamuli 6000 rupee salanaa kaa elaan kiya gaya he jiskaa swaagat he
 But 20,000 crores will be borrowed for this
 aage bhi yahi silsilaa rahegaa
 What does the government have for non-farmer poor, urban poor, agricultural laborers? The government considers fake figures created by itself
 gandhi ne kaha ki gaay ke liye 750 karod, matsaypalan ke liye vibhaag, pension skim aadi kii ghoshnaa se sawaal uthta he ki agar ye jaruri the to paanch saal sarkaar ne kya kiya? sarkaar lagaataar duusare saal vittiya ghate ke lakshya se chook gai he
 If you believe the official profile of Congress leader Yogendra Saw of Jharkhand, he is a great admirer of Emperor Munshi Premchand of Hindi novel
 lekin lagata he ki apane priy lekhak kii kahaniyon ke paatro se unhone koi sikh nahin lee jinamein sandesh diya jaataa he ki jab satta yaa adhikaar haath main aa jaae to insaan ko sankeernataaon se upar uth janaa chahie
 The state was shocked at the fact that the names of leaders, ministers, judges and officers in the black empire of accused Rakibul Hasan in the case of national shooter Tara Shahdev were shocked by the revelations about Agriculture Minister Sav
 2 sitambar ko chumba gaanv main hazaribagh police ne saav ke sahpaathee rahe or aapraadhik giroh jharkhand tigers ke 'oparational head' rajkumaar gupta samet uske paanch mahatvapurn sadasyon—sandip saav, nakul saav, ramchandra saav or prakaash saav—ko giraftaar kiya
 This was enough to get Sav into trouble
 police jaanch ke dauraan gupta ne bataaya ki is avaidh sanghathan kaa gathan mantri mahoday ne hi kiya tha or uski gatividhiyon par baarik najar rakhte the
 Sawa became an MLA from Congress ticket for the first time and was appointed as the Minister of Agriculture in Hemant Soren's government in 2013
 aarope he ki saav ne 2013 main hi gopneey tareeke se paisa ugaahi karne ke liye jharkhand tigers taiyaar kiya
 Their motive was to loot illegal coal traders making huge profits in Hazaribagh
 ve tritiy prastuti cameti or jharkhand prastuti cameti jaise gaiyr-kanoonee sanghathanon ko paisa vasuuli kaa ekmaatr thekedaar banane se rokna chaahate the
 These organizations have become rich by collecting money
 aarope he ki gupta naksali sanghathan se tut kar alag hue tritiy prastuti cameti kaa hi sadsy tha jo baad main jharkhand prastuti cameti main gaya or aakhir main jharkhand tigers kaa mukhiya bana
 Like a good king, Saw allegedly also gave his organization five weapons and four motor cycles as the initial 'capital'
 jharkhand tigers levi vasuulana, phiroti ke liye apharan, dhamkaana jaise kaamon ko anjaam dene laga
 According to police sources, after a few interruptions, the gang managed to pay Rs 50 lakh every month
 luutane main kaamyaab rahaa
 But Sau was not satisfied with this amount
 dhire-dhire hi sahi unki ichha ke anukool kaam ho rahaa tha
 But as he celebrated his 50th birthday on August 18, 2014, Takdir left him early
 sangeen khulaase ke baad saav ko 12 sitambar ko krishi mantri kaa pad chhodia padaa
 Insiders say Saw did not give up the chair easily
 ve apni chhavi kharaab karne ke liye rachi gai sajeesh kii duhai dete rahe
 He agreed to step down only after Chief Minister Hemant Soren took permission from the Congress leadership to dismiss Sawa for not resigning
 kaha ja rahaa he ki hemanth ne unase kaha ki congress bhi unhen jald hataane ke paksh main he, tabhi saav ne istipha diya
 Sau has said that this is a conspiracy of his political opponents
 yahaan tak ki unhone hazaribagh police par tritiy prastuti cameti se mili hone kaa aarope lagaaya he
 (yogendra Saw and alleged mastermind of Jharkhand Tiger Raju Saw in the red circle) Savu, a clever player, did not stay there to assist the Jharkhand Police in the investigation but went to Delhi
 police kii ore se samman bheje jane ke baavjood ve hajir nahin hue
 They are camping in the Jharkhand Bhavan in Delhi and are trying to meet top party leaders
 ab ve duusare vikalp yani aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main patni ko congress se tikat dilwane kii koshish main jute hai
 But this time there are more difficulties for Sau because the Congress bosses have been told everything about their misdeeds
 congress bhi unka samarthan karne main hichkicha rahi he kyonki saav ke sansanikhej maamle ne bijepi ko upie ke khilaaf ek hathiyaar thama diya he
 According to sources, the police have several recordings of telephone conversations in which they can be heard talking to Gupta about the operations of the Jharkhand Tigers
 aise ek vaartalap main saav tab khaase naaraaz lag rahe hai jab jharkhand tigers kaa ek nayaa recruit teen hathiyaaron ke saath bhaag nikalataa he
 They reprimand Gupta for not recruiting a substantial number of foot soldiers and making the organization strong
 ek anya baatcheet main saav or gupta ko chota aadmi or bada aadmi kii charchaa karte suna ja saktaa he
 Police believe that it could be a code word for the weapons purchased, which would have been used for small and large weapons
 vaartalap main ve jharkhand tigers ke opareshnon ke bare main khuleam charchaa kar rahe hai
 The phone records also show that Saw was in regular contact with Gupta and other members
 unke vyaktigat or sarkari phone par lagaataar baat hoti rahati thi
 Gupta used to visit the minister's Ranchi and Hazaribagh residence frequently
 hazaribagh police ko 21 may ko khinchaa gaya ek photo bhi mila he jisamen yogendra saav helicopter main jharkhand tigers ke founder sadsy raju saav ke saath baithe najar aa rahe hai
 It is alleged that Raju Sau had conspired to kidnap Bhavani Mahato, an employee of Central Coal Fields Limited
 unhen june, 2014 main phiroti vasuulne ke liye apahrit kiya gaya tha
 Raju has been in judicial custody since 13 June
 saav kii raju se ghanishthata us vakt saaf ho gai, jab may main loksabhaa chunaav ke parinaam main karaari shikast ke baad congress ne party sanghathan main pherbadal karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 Savu then recommended Raju to be appointed the state Congress general secretary
 rajya congress adhyaksh sukhdev bhagat ko likhe ek patr main saav ne raju ko 'karmath', 'urjavan', 'samarpit or 'lokapriy saamaajik kaaryakarta' jaise visheshnon se nawaja tha
 It was good for the party that Bhagat did not follow the wishes of the minister
 jaahir he, saav pradesh kii raajnneeti main chhaae aise aapraadhik tatwon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai, jo rajya kii raajnneeti ke centre main chaa rahe hai
 These leaders are gangsters, heads of their caste or community and also contractors
 inhone raajnneeti ko vyavsaay banaaya hua he or aise rajnatik paridrishy main kaam kar rahe hai, jahaan rajanetaaon or aparaadhiyon ko alag karne vaali rekha dinodin dhundhlee hoti chali ja rahi he
 Saw's manipulation was also revealed last year when he revealed the secret of becoming a minister to his supporters in August 2013
 apane grih jile hazaribagh main ek sammaan samaaroh main unhone kaha tha, ''samaj lijie, ahamed patel se lekar sonia gandhi, rahul gandhi tak maine kya-kya kiya, yah vistaar se nahin bataa saktaa
 We only know this raajnneeti main juuta seene se lekar chandi paath tak karnaa padataa he
 "his misfortune that the ceremony was video-recorded and also made public
 haalanki us samay congress netritv ne saav ko baksh diya tha
 This seems to be the reason why this inter-pass leader got uplifted
 ranchi main vidhayakon ke liye bane bangalon main se teen par ab bhi ve kabiz hai
 To achieve his goal, still do not eagle from speaking nonsense
 lekin congress ke liye unhen saath rakhana kathin ho saktaa he, bhale hi ve rajeev gandhi or sonia gandhi ko apana adarsh maanate hon

 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii mahaj ek sauhardpurn chitthee se hi july ke pehle hafte main unke japan daure ko radd karne se bhadki bhavanaaen shant ho gayi
 More than the news of the cancellation of the tour, the matter was that Japan had heard about it from the media and it did not spend any time in expressing its displeasure
 lekin jis rajanyik gafalat main aag bhadakne kii puri ashanka thi, us par maano fouran kaabo paa liya gaya
 Later it was revealed that the letter was more personal than official, it had heart-touching talk and cited the same democratic values that bind the two countries in one thread
 usamen pehle hafte main sansad ke bajet satr main apni maujuudagi kaa bhi hawala diya gaya tha
 This plea came immediately to the Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, and the matter settled down there

 Modi's large diplomatic capital has been created by the relatively high convenience to Japanese businessmen in Gujarat
 uske sahare ve ab apane pehle tokio daure main dwipaksheeya vaarta ko asarkaari mukaam par pahunchaa sakate hai
 Modi will also go to Kyoto, the capital of the old Japanese empire, where his predecessor Manmohan Singh could not accept the invitation
 donon deshon ke bich ranneetik saajhedaari varshon se he lekin modi or abe ke bich nijee tallukaat ek nae tarah ke ranneetik rishte kii buniyaad taiyaar karte hai
 Japan is looking for new partners in Asia due to deteriorating relations with China and India offers a natural alternative
 japan ke samaaj main bujurgon kii taadaad bad rahi he jabaki bharat main yuva aabaadi sabase adhik he jo tikaoo or majboot aarthik saajheedaari ke liye behatar vikalp he, khaskar utpaadan kshetra ke maamle main
 And finally Japan has enough capital and India is eager to invest
 lambey samay se japan china kii berukhi se duvidha main he
 Especially in China, its concerns are growing with regard to Japanese economic interests
 lekin pichley kuch varshon se yah maahaul badla he or abe japan main is badlaav ke pratik ban gaye hai
 Their strategic thinking acts as a bridge between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific as Japan now has an intensified round of discussions in the Indian ocean-pacific region
 isi vajah se bharat ko ek saajheedaar or kshetra ke shakti santulan main ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaala mana ja rahaa he
 The same thing is now becoming the basis of Tokyo's practical policy
 japani samvidhan kii samuhik swa-raksha kii avadharana ke hisaab se nai vyakhya kii pahal ne japan main nae samrik saajheedaar ko talashne kaa rasta khol diya he
 a similar agreement is expected to take place during Modi's visit
 isi ke saath asainik atomi qaraar par bhi pragati hone kii ummid he
 However, domestic feelings about the nuclear deal in Japan can also become a major impediment in this
 lekin samrik muddon kii is paramparaagat baton ke alaava asli sambhaavnaaen to aarthik kshetra main hai
 The question is how to make India a natural destination for Japanese investment
 is maamle main kai baadhaaen hai lekin modi or abe ke bich vyaktigat madhur rishton se ek nai tarah kaa vishwaas kaayam ho saktaa he
 One reason for this is that both believe in the same kind of politics
 abe kaa purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke saath bhi bada sahaj rishta tha lekin yah rishta kisi professor or chaatr ke bich jaisaa hi tha
 It was said by the Japanese Prime Minister himself
 akasar mulakaaton main abe sammaan ke saath pesh aate the, khaskar aarthik maamalon main manmohan singh ke gyaan se ve behad prabhavit the
 But the relationship with Modi is of the same level and perhaps more comfortable and present
 donon hi netaaon ne apane-apane desh main logon main aakankshaayen jagaakar chunaav main jeet hasil kii he or donon hi un vaadon par amal karne ko taiyaar dikhte hai
 Its meaning may be to compromise in some basic matters
 abe ne abenomics or ‘‘china plus vanya niti kii shuruyaat kii jabaki modi ne to abhi shuruyaat hi kii he
 Unlike Manmohan Singh, Abe can openly share his talk with Modi and immediately discuss issues on a practical and political level
 yahi vah ranneetik mauka he jisase is saal hone vaala modi kaa yah daura mahatvapurn ho saktaa he
 There is no doubt that the economic agenda is paramount
 modi ke 100 smart shaharon kii yojana main japan kii saajhedaari ahm he
 Then Japan will also be important in the plan to build several industrial corridors
 lekin yah sab is par nirbhar karegaa ki modi or abe ke bich kaisaa talmail banataa he or kin maamalon main patibadghta dikhaayi jaati he
 In this case, despite his good image in China, Modi's trend is inclined towards that
 jaisaa ki ek andruni sutara bataate hai, ‘‘modi china kaa sammaan karte hai lekin pasand to japan ko hi karte hai

 india today se khaas baatcheet main captain ne kaha ki unhone siddhu ko pakistan nahin jane kii salaah di thi, iske baavjood siddhu ne pakistan jane kaa faisla kiya
 Explain that despite the invitation from the Imran government, Captain Amarinder Singh refused to participate in the program organized by Pakistan on November 28 regarding Kartarpur Sahib Corridor
 captain ne punjab ke sthaneey nikaay mantri siddhu ke pakistan jane ke sambandh main kaha ki “jab koi mantri mujhe pakistan yaa kisi ore desh kii nijee yatra par jane ke liye bataata he to main use jane ke liye manaa nahin karata
 Sidhu told me that if he wanted to go to Pakistan, i did not refuse
 kyonki ye nijee yatra thi naa ki aadhikarik sarkari yatra
 But later on Sunday when Sidhu was in Madhya Pradesh, i told him that i have taken the stand of not going to Pakistan in the long term interest of Punjab
 main chahta hum ki tum bhi apane faisle par punarvichaar karo
 On this Sidhu said that i have accepted his invitation
 is par maine siddhu se kaha ki unhen ye kaha ja saktaa he ki hamaare mukhyamantri ne ek faisla kiya he, use dekhte hue main bhi aane main asamarth hum
 On this Sidhu said that i tell you till evening
 lekin phir wo nahin aae
 "please tell that Sidhu left for Pakistan despite the advice of the Captain
 jab captain se poocha gaya ki kya siddhu ne pakistan jaakar mukhyamantri kii avhelnaa nahin kii
 On this, the Chief Minister made it clear that he had only advised Sidhu not the order
 kyonki ye sarkari yatra nahin nijee yatra thi
 The Captain also said that whether Sidhu goes or not, it does not matter the ground situation
 ye puche jane par ki ek taraf aap pakistan kii khufia agency iesai kii punjab samet bharat main aatankwaad ko failaane kii harkaton ko lekar ashankit hai or duusari taraf aap hi ke sarkaar ke mantri (siddhu) pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ko shanti kaa doot or farista bataate hai, kya isse punjab sarkaar ke stand main doharaapan hone kaa sandesh nahin ja rahaa? is sawaal ke jawaab main captain ne kaha, ‘jo meraa stand he vaisaa hi punjab kii adhiktar janata sochati he
 As far as the Kartarpur Saheb Corridor is concerned, we wholeheartedly welcome it
 ham varshon se isaki maang karte rahe hai
 When we previously had a government in Punjab, i had also raised this issue in front of Pervez Musharraf
 coridor ke liye main bharat or pakistan, donon ke pradhanmantriyon ko badhai detaa hum
 The corridor is welcomed by the Sikh community from all over the world including India
 ’lage haath captain amarinder ne pakistani sena kii napak harkaton kaa bhi hawala diya
 The Chief Minister said, 'I want to say to Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa that what he is doing in our Punjab is not acceptable in any case
 captain ke mutabik pichley 18-19 maheene main punjab main hamane aatankwaad ke 19 modules dhwast kiye hai
 81 terrorists are apprehended
 77 hathiyaar baraamad kiye hai
 Also recovered Grenades, ID and explosive material
 ’ captain ne haal main amritsar main nirankaari prarthana sthal par hue grenade hamale kaa bhi hawala dayaa jisamen 3 logon kii maut ho gai or 19 ghayal ho gaye

 ye puche jane par ki kya kartarpur sahib coridor kaa naam aage kar pakistan kii koi chaal to nahin he ki sikh yuvakon ke pakistan pahunchane par unka mindwash kiya jaae? isse aatankwaad badhane kaa kitna khatra he? is sawaal ke jawaab main captain ne kaha, ‘main nahin samajhataa ki aisa hoga
 Kartarpur Sahib is situated at a very short distance from the border
 aise main nahin lagata ki pakistan ko vahaan jane vaale shraddhaluon se adhik sampark kaa mauka milegaa
 The Captain also said that on the construction of the corridor, the first batch will go to Kartarpur Sahib, they will also join it

 Capt Amarinder Singh said that if Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan is really serious about peace between the two countries, then he should first tell his army chief General Bajwa that he should ask ISI to desist from his nefarious antics in India including Punjab
 
 agar aisa nahin hota he to tanaav badhegaa or phir bhartiya sena aisi chunautiyon se nipatane ke liye puri tarah sakasham he

 haryana police kii esaiti ko panchkula hinsa or deraa sachcha sauda maamle main court ne tagada jhatka diya he
 The court has ordered decree to remove sections of sedition and attempt to murder on 53 accused
 iske baad sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya haryana police is tarah se sarkaar par kiye gaye gurmeet ram rahim ke ahsaanon kaa badla chukaa rahi he
 The biggest legal screw in this case was that the Haryana Police did not take permission from the home department of the central and state government before registering a case of treason against the accused
 isliye court ke farmaan ke baad sawaal uthaa ki kya police ne doshiyon ko bachaane ke liye jaan boojhkar centre or rajya sarkaar se deshadroh kaa maamle main ijazat nahin lee?ahm baat ye bhi he ki 53 deraa premiyon ke khilaaf deshadroh sabit karne main naakaam rahane vaali police, kya haniprit ko gunaahagaar sabit karvaa paaegi? ab aisa prathit hota he kidera sachcha saudahinsa maamle kii jaanch main jaan boojhkar tathyon ko najar andaaz kiya gaya
 Because of which Haryana Police is troubled
 court main naakaam pulispichley saal hazaron deraa samarthakon ko panchkula main ghusane se rokane main naakaam rahi haryana police ab hinsa ke aarope main pakade gaye gurmeet ram rahim ke chelon par deshadroh ke aarope sabit karne me fail ho gai he
 The reason is that the top officers of Haryana Police did not get permission from either Haryana nor the Home Department of the Central Government before registering a case of treason
 doosraa deshadroh ke aarope sabit karne ke liye esaiti court main saboot bhi nahin de pai
 Not only this, the court also refused to accept charges under section 307 on the dera's miscreants
 udhar, deraa hinsa maamle ke yachikakarta vakil ravinder dhull ne police par jaanboojh kar dhilaai baratane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 According to Dhull, the police did not deliberately take permission from the Home Department to make the case weak
 police ko pehle bhi mili fatkargauratlab he ki jaanch main khaamiyon ke chalate hai court kii bench se bhi haryana police ko fatkaar mil chuki he
 Balraj, who was carrying cash and other valuables out of the camp, was also not questioned by police officers
 yahi nahin deraa kii cheirperson vipasana insaan ke khilaaf warrant jari hone ke baavjood bhi use giraftaar nahin kiya gaya
 Till date, the police could not make Gurmeet Ram Rahim an accused in the violence
 yahi vajah he ki haryana sarkaar or police kii niyat par sawaal uth rahe hai
 The court had heard these orders, the court hearing the Panchkula violence and arson cases on Monday morning gave a big blow to the SIT of Haryana Police
 court ne aadesh diya he ki 53 aropiyon ke khilaaf darj kiye gaye deshadroh or hatya ke prayaas ke aaropon ko exiaar se hataa den
 Because the police do not have enough evidence to prove these allegations
 haalanki court ne saaf kar diya kihaniprit insaan, aditya insaan or duusare logon ke khilaaf deshadroh or aapraadhik shadyantr ke maamle jari rahenge
 The accused against whom the sections of sedition and attempt to murder have been asked to be removed include 53 accused including Panchkula Dera incharge Chamkaur Singh, spokesperson Surendra Dhiman
 court ne apane aadesh main kaha he ki police ne aropiyon ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 307 bhi lagaai thi, lekin 25 agast ko hui hinsa ke maamle se yah sabit nahin hota ki kisi pulicekarmi yaa anya ko jaan kaa khatra he
 The SIT probing the case could not prove the charges of treason against the accused
 bachaav paksh ke vakeelon ne court ko bataaya tha ki police maamle se judi sisitivi footage kii recording yaa aise tathy pesh nahin kar pai jisase deshadroh ke aarope sabit ho saken
 According to defense lawyer Suresh Rohilla, the accused will now be heard in the trial court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate of Panchkula
 ye tha puraa maamlagauratlab he ki pichley saal 25 agast ke din deraa sachcha sauda ke pramukh gurmeet ram rahim ko balaatkaar ke maamle main doshi qaraar die jane ke baad panchkula main hinsa bhadki thi
 In which 34 people were killed
 in dangon kii jaanch karne ke liye police ne 8 se zyada esaiti team banaakar court main chaalaan pesh kiya tha
 During the violence, supporters of Gurmeet Ram Rahim damaged government and personal property worth about 400 crores

 china ke is faisle ke peeche uski manshaa kya he, is par ajtak aapako puri jaankaree dene ja rahaa he ki aakhir vah masood ajahar or pakistan main pal rahe aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ko kyon bachaana chahta he? ji haa, iske peeche kii insaide story yah he ki kya china jaish ke aatankiyon se khauf khaataa he yaa phir china ke ungihaar praant main aatankwaad badhane se darataa he
 The attack on the CPEC project is answered by both the terrorist organizations in Pakistan, Jaish and Lashkar
 sabase pehle aapako bataa den ki china kaa sipiisi project gilgit-baltistan kshetra se hi nahin jaataa he balki yah project paak adhikrut kashmir or pakistan ke mansehara jile ke us ilaake se bhi gujarata he jo khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa main padataa he
 Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the same state where a large number of terrorists were killed by the Indian Air Force during an air strike at jaish-e-mohammed's training camp in Balakot
 darasal, china kaa yah sipiisi project khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa (capike) ke is ilaake se hokar gujarata he jahaan balakot main aatanki camp maujuud tha
 Damage can threaten Jaishchin if he does not stop Masood Azhar from being declared a global terrorist, then jaish-e-mohammed terrorists should not attack more than 12,000 Chinese citizens working in his CPEC project Please do it
 isi dar se shaayad china masood ajahar par bain lagane main bharat or duusare deshon kii madad nahin kar rahaa he
 Anyway, it has been the concern of China that where it makes its work, it works only and only there and that is why it is in some way to protect the projects of China in Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir which go through CPEC in Pakistan
 Tak is also engaged in helping the terrorist
 khufia sutron ne ajtak ko jaankaree di he ki mansehara samet kai ilaakon main dheron aatanki camp chalate hai jisamen balakot camp ab nasht ho chukaa he
 Terrorists trained in other Jaish camps can pose a threat to the Chinese engineer
 sutron ne ajtak ko jaankaree di he ki china ne haal hi balakot ke paas maujuud neshnal hive-15 ke paas kai jagahon par sipiisi project ke liye jameen kharida he
 He fears that the Jaish terrorists may kidnap his engineers
 yahi nahin, china sipiisi project ke tahat paak adhikrut kashmir main kai jagahon par power project bhi bana rahaa he
 Information about the power project that Aaj Tak has
 uske mutabik kai aise power project us ilaake se guzar rahe hai jahaan pakistan kii khufia agency iesai ne aatank kaa garh bana rakhaa he
 Fearing the Lashkar attack, China is building the 1,100 MW Fog hydro power project in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (pok) as well as the Karot hydro power project in China
 yahi nahin 640 megawatt kaa aaazaad pattan or 640 hi megawatt kaa maahi hydro power project paak adhikrut kashmir main china hi bana rahaa he
 Sources have informed that China is afraid that if it does not please Pakistan, then terrorists Masood Azhar and lashkar-e-taiba, who are hiding in his hideout, should not attack his project which could cause great harm to him
 
 iske saath hi sutron ne yah bhi jaankaree di he ki china ko is baat kaa bhi dar lagata he ki uske ungihaar praant main jis tareeke se lashkar-e-taiyaba se samarthit aatanki vahaan par hamalaa karte hai, us baat se bhi vah darataa he
 China wants it to reach out to the Islamic world through Pakistan and can also stop the terrorists by sending radicals to Lashkar and other terrorist organizations in China's Ugihar province
 yahi vajah he ki vah pakistan or uski khufia agency iesai or paak sena ko kisi tareeke se naakhush nahin karnaa chahta he
 Sources have given no information till date that the East Turkmenistan Independence Movement ie ETIM works behind the terror spread in Ugihar province of China, which is done by Lashkar, funding and logistic support
 lashkar-e-taiyaba pakistan kaa pehla paaltu aatanki he or china pakistan ke jariye lashkar tak pahunchnaa chahta he jisase vah apane praant main fail rahe aatanki ghatana ko bachaa sake
 However, a question arises that the way in which China is doing its own and alien about terror, it may suffer a lot in the future
 china bharat main pulavama aatanki hamalaa karne vaale aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ko bachaane main juta hua he, vahiin vah apane desh main fail rahe aatank ko bachaane ke liye pakistan ke andar ghus rahaa he
 This double trick of China will expose him at one time or another
 raksha mantri eke antni ne kaha he ki bharat-pakistan seemaa par tanaav main kami ai he, lekin sthiti abhi saamaanya nahin hui he or yah pakistan kii karrwai par nirbhar karti he
 Antony said that India is not a war-crazy country and the situation will take some time in the normal process
 unhone is baat par jor diya ki sthiti saamaanya hona puri tarah vishwaas bahaali ke upayon or mukhya rup se pakistan kii karrwai par nirbhar karata he
 The Defense Minister said that tensions on the border have come down following the telephonic discussions between the defense officials of the two countries
 baharhaal, sthiti saamaanya nahin hui he
 He said that i cannot give any timeline for normalization of the situation, but it depends on the attitude and actions of Pakistan

 tanushri datta- naanaa patekar vivaad ke baad bharat main # metoo kaa maamla tool pakad chukaa he
 So far, many women have come forward and made allegations of sexual harassment
 naanaa patekar, vivek agnihotri, sajid khan, vikaas bahal, piyush mishra, alok nath, or rajat kapur jaise kai naam saamne aa chuke hai
 Now Renuka Shahane has also come forward in this matter
 renuka ne apane saath hue durvyavhaar kii kahani bataai he
 What's the matter? In an interview to 'pinkvilla', Renuka said, "I went to Noida for Antakshari shoot
" maine kai outdoor shoot kiye hai to mujhe kamare main akele rahane kii aadat ho gai thi
 "" a man came to my room for room service and started to act dirty in front of me
 sabase pehle usne mujhase kaha ki wo meraa bahut bada fain he or maine use dhanyavad kaha
 After this, he kept food and started doing dirty activities
 ye bahut hi bhayanak tha
 i immediately asked him to go out and told the manager to complain "" After that i called Ashwini, the assistant of 'atakshari' into the room
 main is puri ghatana se buree tarah hill gai thi
 After this, i was never alone in the room
 main hameshaa apane heredressor ke saath rahati hum
 He said that people feel that there are such people in the industry itself but there are many people you have to deal with outside as well
 Reaction given
 unhone 'ham aapke hai koun' main alok nath kii bahu kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa tha
 When Renuka did not make any statement in the case of Alok Nath, a user told him how his silence was different from Anurag Kashyap and Tanmay Bhatt
 iske baad renuka ne kaha- kyonki tanmay or anuraag imployar hai, main nahin hum
 None of my employees have complained about Alok Nath
 deepika amin ne ek friend ke taur par mere saath tab kamphase kiya tha, jab main alok nath ke saath do project puri kar chuki thim
 How silly! Why would i apologize? Oh i guess you think i should apologize for NOT sexually molesting anyone, NOT raping anyone? i guess you want me to apologize for my solidarity with the women who are speaking up about their harassment? Get well soon! Https: / / t

 To this, Renuko replied- "why should i apologize? i think you are thinking that i should apologize for not molesting or raping anyone
" aap chaahate hai ki main us mahila ke saath ekajute hone ke liye maafee maanguun, jo apane herracement ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaa rahi he

 The nomination process for the presidential election in Parliament House started on Wednesday

 Interestingly, none of these people is a politician or one who has access to votes in this election
 bas dil main badlaav kii chaah he, jo inhen sansad tak le ai he
 However, all the nominations filed are believed to be rejected

 Among those who filed nominations are Mumbai's husband wife Saira Banu Mohammed Patel and Mohammed Patel Abdul Hameed

 kyonki is chunaav main kisi aam aadmi ke jeetne kii ummid nahin hoti he
 More than that, the complaint is that the election nomination form is quite complicated
 isse naaraaz eliyas chunaav form ke mudde ko lekar jantar-mantar par dharne kii bhi taiyaari kar rahe hai
 The nomination process will continue till June 28 and the retrenchment will take place on June 29
 agar jaruri hua to 17 july copresident ellection ke liye voting hogi or phir 20 july ko counting kii jaaegi

 'agenda ajtak' ke satr 'apni bhashaaen hai jaruri' main geetkaar javed akhtar, kavi ashok vaajapeyi va lekhak anuja chouhan ke bich charchaa behad sarthak rahi
 Hating the language, describing Galatkabir as a greater poet than Homer, lyricist and screenwriter Javed Akhtar said that Hindi and English people hate each other's language and the reason for the decline of language in films is society
 ‘agenda ajtak’ sammelan main bhashaayi satr main javed akhtar ne kaha, ‘jabaan jade hai, hindi tana he or angreji shakhayein he, jiske jariye puri duniya tak pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 But the trend towards language has reduced in the new generation
 sthiti yah he ki angreji jaanane vaala hindi se or hindi jaanane vaala angreji se nafrat karata he
 This is sick, but true
 ’hindustan main shaayari bahut achchhiek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha, ‘hindustan main shaayari bahut acchhee hui he
 Kabir is a great poet, far ahead of Homer (greek poet) or any poet in the world

 'he said,' Language arithmetic has also become somewhat like caste equation, Brahmin who knows English and Shudra who does not know
 angreji jaananaa acha he, lekin antardhvani aapako apni bhashaa main hi milegi, jisamen aap sapane dekhte he

 unhone kaha ki vipakshi netaa chaahate hai ki iviem main harsambhav paardarshita kaayam rakhi jaae
 The senior Congress leader said that with the consent of all parties, a suggestion was made to match the votes of evms to vvpats at half the polling stations in every state to maintain the credibility of evms before the Commission
 telugu desham party ke netaa evam andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu ne kaha ki hamaare samaksh iviem ko lekar ashankaayen rahi hai

 unhone kaha, ‘shandaar (ganguli kaa adhyaksh bananaa)
 At first i am thrilled that the BCCI is in existence again

 ' arvind kejariwal 'india today newsmekar of da year 2013' hai
 For this, you can see the issue of India Today magazine of 6 January 2014
 india today ke managing editor es prasannarajan ne aam aadmi party ke is netaa se baatcheet kii
 Arvind gave his views and plans for the government
 sawaal: ek street fiter se satta main aa gaye hai aap
 How do you see this change? Answer: Life remains the same for me
 anyaay or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladate rahane ko hi maine jivan samajha he
 This fight continues
 haa, iske tareeke jarur badal rahe hai
 First we campaigned for the right to information, then we did the Lokpal movement and after that formed a political party
 is tarah ranneeti badal rahi he, lekin anyaay or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai jari he
 Question: Your struggle is going to continue even after coming to power? Answer: Yes
 jab aap power main hote hai to is par nirbhar karata he ki aap use kis nazariye se dekhte hai
 If power is a responsibility, then the war against injustice continues
 lekin agar power se akad aa jaae to phir vah samasya ban jaati he
 Then you create problems for others and others come down to fight against you
 sawaal: street fiter kaa romance ab puraa ho chukaa he
 Are you ready for the bitter reality of real politics now? Answer: It was never a romance for us
 har kadam par jimmedaari kii bhaavana thi
 If it was an antique experience for us, then we would have left everything with the end of the movement
 jab hamane raajnneetik dal banaaya to kai logon ne samajha ki ham satta ke laalchee hai
 Then our image was at stake
 yah kahana galat hoga ki tab romance tha or ab jimmedaari
 Question: Decentralization is the core of its idea
 aisa karne ke liye aap kya karne ja rahe hai
 Bad institutions are about to fix or remove them
 jawaab: kuch sansthaanon ko majboot karne kii jarurat he, kuch sansthaaon ke nirmaan kiye jane kii aavashyaktaa he
 And there are some institutions that have to be removed
 sawaal: kya aap vistaar se bataae paaenge?jawaab: CAG or nyaaypalika bahut jaruri sansthaaen hai, inhen majboot karne kii jarurat he
 Some new institutions like Lokpal, Mohalla Sabhas, Ward Sabhas need to be created
 or agar koi sanstha he jo bekaar ho chuki he, use hataaya janaa chahie
 At the moment i am not thinking of anything special
 sawaal: vikendrikaran kaa vichaar aapako kahaan or kab mila?jawaab: yah ek dhimaa process he
 When i met Aruna ji (aruna Roy), i came to know about 'right to Information'
 tab 2001 tha
 We were working on RTI
 usee dauraan hamaare saamne bhrashtachar ke kai maamle saamne aae
 Whenever we used to go to the government for some work, the government used to say that there is no fund for this
 hamane phir dekha ki kai pashchimi deshon main aam aadmi kii bhagidaari sarkaar main sidhe taur par he or bahut zyada he
 The final decision is taken by the public
 iske baad yah puraa vichaar mere man main aayaa
 Question: i read your book 'swaraj'
 kya vikendrikaran or swaraj donon samaan hai?jawaab: haa, lagbhag samaan hai
 Swaraj means that people should have the power to govern themselves, this is direct democracy
 vikendrikaran (decentralisation) kaa istemaal karnaa galat hoga
 This suggests that power is only at the upper level
 vastav main power nichle str par hoti he
 Now the time has come to take power from the hands of the top
 sawaal: kya aapkaa swaraj kaa vichaar gandhi se prerit he?jawaab: beshak, hamane gandhi ko padhaa he
 We have learned from the experience of many countries
 yahi nahin pracheen or madhya bharat ke yug se bhi kai rochak anubhav hamaare saamne hai
 It can be seen that even in ancient India (before the British Raj), direct democracy worked at small levels
 sawaal: 21veen sadi ke bharat ke bare main aapkaa kya vijan he?jawaab: aisa samaaj, jahaan har dharm or jati ke log ek saath shanti or samanta se rahete hon
 They respect each other
 sabhi log achche shikshit hon
 Everyone deserves to be able to earn and maintain their family easily
 main yah nahin kar rahaa ki har koi bahut zyada amir ho, lekin itnaa ho honi hi chahie ki use acchhee shiksha or khaanaa uplabdh ho sake
 Question: Now you are coming to power, now how will you balance between the idea of resistance and the reality of the government? Answer: i have worked in the Income Tax Department
 hamaare saath kai log hai jo alag-alag kshetron main kaam kar chuke hai
 We have a mixture of very good people
 to aisa nahin he ki ye log sari jindagi pratirodh hi karte rahe hai
 To be fair, we do not even think that we have a complete mind and we will change everything
 hamaare paas jaadu kii chadi nahin he
 But we believe that when one and a half crore people living in Delhi come together, the solution to every problem will be possible
 ham sarkaar kii paribhaasha badal denge
 Now every man of Delhi will be the government
 sawaal: agar aap swatantraaa andolan ke itihaas ko bhi dekhen to aazaadee ke liye ladane se mushkil aazaadee ko banaae rakhana he
 Do you think a difficult time is ahead for you? Answer: It is a big responsibility
 yah sirf jimmedaari nahin balki jis tarah kii ummiden logon ko hamase hai ve bahut badi hai or kabhi-kabhi vastav main mujhe dar lagata he
 i have told all my mlas that the whole world is eyeing them, if they make even a small mistake, history will never forgive them
 sawaal: ek vyakti ke netritv main chalane vaale zyaadaatar andolanon main jab bhi ve satta main aate hai to hameshaa sarvocch netaa ke sarvesarva banane kaa khatra rahata he
 We hope that this does not happen to you
 jawaab: vikendrikaran hi iskaa uttar he
 If i have a lot of strength, then i feel that tomorrow i can be arrogant, away from everyone's reach
 shaayad main bhrasht nahin ho saktaa, lekin or bhi kai vyaktitv se judy kamiyaan ho sakati hai
 The challenge is that i should not have all the powers, the power should be with the people
 sawaal: ab tak to satta vikendrikaran or swaraj jaise bade-bade vichaar the
 But in administration everything happens on the ground
 jawaab: main puri tarah se aapke saath sahamat hum
 And let me tell you that we have also worked in detail to some extent
 iske liye hamane kuch bahut hi varisht sevanivruth naukarshahon kii madad lee he
 But now everything needs to be cleared and we assure that good officers in Delhi administration will help in designing the system
 aisa nahin he ki ham bilkul parfect system bana denge, balki hamen isamen lagaataar badlaav laane honge
 This will be a continuous dynamic process
 sawaal: kya aapane kabhi is tarah ke lamhe kii kalpana kii thi?jawaab: maine apane jivan main kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki main chunaav laduunga or ek raajnneetik party banaaungaa
 Question: Do you believe in religion, do you believe in karma? Answer: Yes, i believe in karma
 apane bachapan main main aastik tha, jab iaiti gaya to naastik ho gaya
 But in the last three years, i have started believing in God once again
 kyonki ek andolan jo kaaphi bada andolan ban gaya, tab mujhe ehsaas hua ki ham kitne chote the
 This was not because of us, there were definitely some supernatural powers behind it
 sawaal: to aapmen bhi kuch badlaav aae hai?jawaab: bilkul, hamaare liye yah ek nirantar yatra he
 It is a spiritual journey
 sawaal: aap kis swabhaav ke vyakti hai prakruti, prerana yaa taarkikajawab: aap sirf prerana yaa umang ke bharose nahin chal sakate or aap hameshaa taarkik bhi nahin ho sakate kyonki jis tarah kaa kaam ham kar rahe hai vah umang or prerana se hota he or prakruti va bhaawanaaon kii isamen ahm bhoomika hoti he
 Logic works when you plan things
 sawaal: ek bahut vyast din ke baad aap kis tarah kii kitaab badhanaa pasand karte hai?jawaab: pichley kuch saalon se maine koi kitaab nahin padhi he
 i last read the Bhagavad Gita
 mere paas bilkul bhi samay nahin he
 In the morning, when i used to go for the morning walk, i used to listen to bhajans, but now that too has been missed
 sawaal: janamat sangrah ke liye aapke junun ko dekhte hue, kya ye aane vaali chizon kaa sanket he? jab bhi kuch bade nirnay lene honge to kya aap har baar janamat sangrah karaayenge?jawaab: jaahir se aap janamat sangrahon se sarkaar nahin chalaa sakate
 But once a year, once in two years, whenever a major decision has to be taken, i think public opinion must be taken
 sawaal: aap loktantr main aam sahmati ko mahatvapurn nirnay lene ke liye sabase acha tarika maanate hai? lekin ek netaa janata kii bhalaayi ke liye alokapriy nirnay bhi le saktaa he
 So will you not take such important decisions? jawaab: kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki janamat sangrah yaa janata kii raay se alokapriy nirnay nahin liye ja sakate
 i do not agree with this
 unhen pataa hi nahin he ki janata kaise kaam karti he
 We have held many such public meetings and very unpopular decisions have been taken in them
 isaki ek hi shart he ki eemaandaaree se mudde kii sabhi achchhaiyaan or buraaiyaan logon ke saamne pesh karen
 Question: Sometimes you talk like a Gandhian and sometimes you look like a communist
 jawaab: asal main ham bahut saadhaaran log hai
 We want a solution
 hamaari apni samasyaayein hai
 We have water problem, electricity problem, road problem, education and health problem also
 agar samyavaadee tareeke se hamaari samasyaon kaa hal nikalataa he to ham vahaan se samaadhaan nikaalenge or agar samaajawaadee tareeke se hamaari samasyaayein hal hongi to ham vahaan se hal dhundhenge
 Either way, we want solutions to the problems
 sawaal: aap ek saadhaaran vyakti ke pratik rahe hai
 Will it be a burden to remain a common man now? jawaab: mujhe nahin lagata ki yah koi boj he
 i think what you are is inside you
 mere liye koi or ban janaa naammumkin he

 ram mandir mudde ko lekar loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko samarthan dene kii baat par vishwa hindu parishad kii safai ai he
 The executive chairman of the organization, Alok Kumar, while clarifying his statement said that no proposal of support has been given to the Congress
 viechpi kisi raajnneetik dal kaa samarthan nahin karti
 He also said that he is mobilizing the support of all parties on the Ram temple issue
 isse pehle unhone kaha tha ki congress agar loksabhaa chunaav ke apane ghoshnaptr main ram mandir kaa mudda shaamil karegi to samarthan par vichaar karenge
 Alok Kumar said, `` Those who have openly promised for the Ram temple, if Congress includes in the manifesto that they will build the temple, then they will also think about it (congress)
 usne jo pratibandh lagaaya he ki sangh ke swayamsevak congress main nahin ja sakate usko waapas le
 Wearing only Janeu will not happen
 ' nae saal ke pehle saptaah main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne ram mandir ke nirmaan ko lekar bada bayaan diya tha
 He said that the issue of Ayodhya Ram temple is still in court
 saath hi unhone kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav main naukari or kisaanon se jude mudde par ahm honge
 In conversation with Aaj Tak, Rahul had said, 'ram temple matter is in court, but in 2019 elections, issues like jobs, farmers' concern, corruption will be important
 ' is bich viechpi ke is bayaan ko bijepi ke liye bada jhatka bhi mana ja rahaa tha
 It was also said among the speculators that the vhp's faith in the BJP on the temple issue is shaking
 iskaa andaja alok kumaar ke bayaan se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 He targeted the Modi government at Kumbh in a gesture and said, 'now it seems to us that we do not know what the government's compulsions are, but perhaps this government will not have the possibility of legislation in this term
 is
 ham desh kii sari paristhitiyon ko santon ke saamne rakhenge or puuchhenge ki aage kya karnaa he
 The saint will guide this campaign forward
 main aapse kahuun abhi turant aam chunaav se pehle mandir bane isaki sambhaavna ab zyada nahin he
 However, now Alok Kumar has said while clarifying that the VHP has not offered any support to the Congress
 bataa den ki purv pradhanmantri or congress ke varisht netaa rahe rajeev gandhi dwaara mandir ke taale khulwaane ke baad badi sankhya main log or hindu sanghathan unke saath aa gaye the
 After which the Congress was strengthened from the ground to the Parliament
 aise main agar congress ram mandir ke liye apane daravaaje kholti he or apane ghoshnaptr main viechpi kii baat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue mandir masale ko shaamil kar leti he to bijepi ko aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main bada nuksaan jhelana pad saktaa he
 Regarding the Ram temple, the Congress has been supportive in the matter but in a low voice
 haal hi main uttarakhand ke varisht congress netaa harish ravat ne kaha tha ki ayodhya main ram mandir kaa nirmaan congress ke satta main aane ke baad hi ho paaegaa
 Rawat had said, 'we believe in policies and the Constitution
 ayodhya main ram mandir tabhi ban paayegaa jab centre main congress kii sarkaar banegi
 it's sure
 'vahiin, uttar pradesh congress ke adhyaksh raaj babbar ne haal hi main kaha tha ki ram mandir ayodhya main nahin banegaa to or kahaan banegaa
 However, he also said, 'where the temple will be built in Ayodhya, this decision can be decided in the court itself
 unhone kaha tha ki bhagwaan ram ke mandir ko lekar koun nahin chahta he
 Whether it is Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Christian
 har vyakti chahta he ki ram mandir bane
 'prime Minister Narendra Modi in his recent interview had said on the Ram temple issue that the matter is still in court, in which case the government will wait for the judicial process to be completed
 vahiin, aresas ke bhaiyyaji joshi ke us bayaan ke baad aayaa he jisamen unhone 2025 tak mandir nirmaan kii prakriya puraa karne kii baat kahi thi
 Joshi had said, 'we wish that Ram temple in Ayodhya be built by 2025
 maine 2025 main shuru karne kii baat nahin kii, aaj shuru hoga to 5 varshon main banegaa
 ' bataa den ki isse pehle pulavama main hue aatanki hamale ko lekar pakistani pradhanmantri imran khan ne mangalvaar ko press conference kii
 He denied Pakistan's involvement in the Pulwama incident, asking why he was being held responsible without any evidence
 unhone kaha ki aakhir is ghatana se pakistan ko kya phayda he
 When Pakistan is going towards stability
 jab yuddh ke kaaran hajaaron pakistani maare gaye hai
 Then what is the benefit of Pakistan from such an incident
 imran khan ne kaha ki hamaari jameen se koi vahaan jaakar hamalaa nahin kiya
 However, if you want to investigate any kind, we are ready
 pakistan kii sanliptata kaa aap subut denge to guarantee detaa hum ki main ection luungaa
 Imran Khan also said that if India goes to war, Pakistan will not think but will respond
 kyonki pakistan ke paas iske alaava koi vikalp nahin rahegaa
 He said that we all know that it is easy to start a war, it is in the hands of humans, but it is not in human hands to end the war
 yah masalaa aakhir main doylaag se hal hoga
 In spite of the complete restriction on the beating of children in schools in the country, the cases of ruthless beating of children in schools are not being named
 aisa hi ek tazaa maamla shimla ke kanya sarkari skool portmor kaa he jahaan ek dance teacher ne ek chaatra kii sirf isliye danda se peetai kar di kyunki usne ek pratispardhaa se pehle reharsal ke samay dance main galat step kar diya tha
 After the incident, the victim's family is very angry and is demanding strict action against the accused teacher
 parijanon ne chota shimla thane main maamla darj karvaa diya he
 The victim is undergoing medical treatment by the police and a case has been registered against the accused teacher
 jahaan desh bhar main sarkaar ne skulon main bacchon kii peetai par pratibandh lagane ke liye kadaa kaanoon banaaya he vahin ab bhi kai shikshak is kaanoon kii parvaah naa karte hue bacchon kii bevajaah peetai karne se gurez nahin karte
 In Shimla also, the eighth grade student of Kanya Vidyalaya Portmore beat her with a pole by the dance teacher of her school
 chaatra kii galati sirf itani si thi kii usne solan main hone vaali pratispardhaa se pehle chal rahi dance reharsal main ek step galat kar diya tha
 Just after seeing this, the mercury of the accused dance teacher climbed to the seventh sky and he started beating the student with a stick
 peetai se chaatra ke sharir par kai ghaav aa gaye
 After the incident, the family members of the victim student have demanded strict action against the accused teacher
 abhibhavakon kaa aarope he kii unki bacchee ko dance teacher ne beharahami si peeta he
 Parents say that they only send their children to school, while the dance teacher took her child to compete on her own
 udhar shimla police ne aaropee teacher ke khilaaf maamla darj kar tafteesh shuru kar di he
 SP Abhishekh Dullar of Shimla says that there is a ban on beating of any child in the school, so according to the law, the accused teacher is being tried
 peedit chaatra kaa medical karavaaya ja rahaa he
 At the same time, the Chief Parliamentary Secretary of the Himachal Pradesh Education Department says that the parents have not informed them about the matter
 lekin maamla sangyaan main aane ke baad aaropee teacher par sarkaar sakht karwai karegi
 On the other hand, the school management is also not saying anything about the case and the accused teacher is also not coming in front of the media

 Former World Champion Captain Kapil Dev of Team India said that the success of wrist spinners in the Indian Premier League (IPL) has increased so much that even successful off-spinners like Ravichandran Ashwin have to try their hand in leg spin bowling

 With the absence of Rawat supporters from Vijay Bahuguna's swearing-in ceremony, it is believed that the Congress is worried
 navnirvaachit vidhayakon main se ek ne kaha ki nayi sarkaar 10-15 din bhi nahin chalegi
 Harish Rawat told reporters tonight that he has no plans to leave the Congress but will continue to fight for his claim to the post of Chief Minister

 We do a lot to brighten our face but do nothing to make our black neck blonde just below it

 If you want, you can make your black neck blonde by following these tips: 1
 otmil kaa scrubotmil lekar use acchhee tarah pis len lekin use thodaa raf hi rahane den
 Add two teaspoons of tomato juice and one teaspoon of honey to it
 is paste se hafte main do baar gardan kii safai karen
 You will get the result in a few days only
 2
 Lemon is vitamin c found in Evergreenniambu
 ye ek natural bleech he
 Rub the lemon on the throat with light hands before bathing

 It would be better to use lemon two to three times a week
 3
 Honey with lemon is also a good remedy
 Make a pack of lemon and honey
 is pack ko gardan par lagaakar kuch der ke liye aise hi chhod den
 When going for a bath, clean it thoroughly
 isse baarik rekhaon vaali problem bhi dur ho jaaegi
 4
 baking soda ko bilkul nahin bhuulembeking soda bhi neembu kii tarah ek natural bleech he
 Take two spoons of baking powder
 isamen pani milakar ek semi-liquid ghol bana len
 Apply it on the neck and leave it for a while
 gardan kaa kaalaapan kuch baar ke istemaal se hi dur ho jayega
 6
 kaccha papeeta bhi rakhen paskaccha papeeta katkar pis len
 But not very granular
 ab isamengulab jal or ek chammach dahi milakrek mixchar taiyaar kar len
 Apply it on the neck and leave it to dry for some time

 Kiwi batsmen were scoring runs all around the field
 bhartiya gendbaaj ek wicket jhatak kar match main vaapasi ke liye har daanv aajamaa rahe the, lekin safalataa nahin mil rahi thi
