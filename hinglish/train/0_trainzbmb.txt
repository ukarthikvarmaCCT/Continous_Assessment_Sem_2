 These banks gave loans to Vikram Kothari by following the rules
 lekin ab kothaari na to byaaj chukaa rahe hai naa mul
 Failing to repay the loan in February 2017, the banks declared him a willful defaulter, which was a deliberate inability to repay the loan

 In response to questions about embezzlement, Kothari said that "I am not running away from the country

 Meanwhile, reports have come that after Gitanjali Gems Limited's Compliance Officer Pankhudi Warange resigned after the scam was exposed, Chief Financial Officer Chandrakant Karkare resigned in the name of his ailing wife
 bihar main isi tarah kaa pichley saal agast main srijan ghotaalaa saamne aayaa tha
 The creation scam was also a banking scam
 2013 main hi bhartiya reserve bank ne likhaa tha ki srijan ke khate kii jaanch ho magar jaanch nahin hui, ghotaalaa chalata rahaa
 Now when the scam came to light, the case went to the CBI
 6 maheene se sibiai jaanch kar rahi he magar srijan ghotaale ke mukhya aaropee giraftaar tak nahin hue hai
 The comments hamaare sahyogi manish kumaar ne report file kii he ki abhi tak srijan ghotaale ke mukhya abhiyukt priya or amit faraar hai
 The CBI has not yet taken a warrant for his arrest
 1500 karod ke is ghotaale ko lekar sibiai kii yah raftaar he
 When the government's plans reached Bhagalpur, the District Magistrate used to cut the check and give it to the branch of Bank of Baroda, Bhagalpur, to deposit the money in the account of the institution called Srujan
 vahaan se paisa nikalataa tha or logon main bant jaataa tha
 This is such a scam, if it was investigated quickly, then other states would also be affected, but everything is growing like slow news
 bihar main sarkaar badal gai he or srijan ghotaale kii baat dhimi pad gai he
 If CBI could not arrest the main accused in 6 months then what to say, while CBI has so far filed 5 charge sheets, 2 supplementary charge sheets
 abhi to jaanch main tezi aa rahi he
 After two to three days when the focus of the media will change, the creation of the Punjab National Bank scam will also be similar to the creation scam
 bihar jaise garib rajya main koi 1500 karod lut le jaae or kisi ko fark hi na pade to garibon kaa bhagwaan hi maalik he
 The questions being raised in the press conference seem to be more to generate noise, less to answer
 khabaron main yah soochna theli gai ki 5000 karod se adhik kii sampatti baraamad ho gai
 So the experts of these cases said that the game of Nirav Modi is to sell goods worth 10 rupees by telling them 500 rupees
 kya hamaari jaanch agenciyon ne 5000 karod kaa hi maal pakadaa he, kahin aisa to nahin ki sara maal hi 100 karod kaa ho
 Nirav Modi is not yet under the scanner of the investigating agencies
 pradhanmantri ke hamaare mehul bhai bhi abhi tak giraft main nahin aae hai jinaki company par 4,886 karod kaa chuunaa lagane kaa aarope he
 There are raids in shops
 dukandaar kaa hi pataa nahin he
 Punjab National Bank has not said from its side that it has got 5000 crores
 akhbaaron kii hedline manage ho chuki he
 The news was published without any basis that 5000 crores were recovered
 yah soochna bhi apni jagah yathaavat he ki is ghotaale kaa ek charam bindu 2017 main bhi pahunchataa he jab gitanjali james limited qareeb 5000 karod kii nikasi ke liye letters of anderteking yani aloyu hasil karti he
 On February 15, the second FIR lodged by the CBI said that Mehul Choksi had defrauded Rs 4,887 crore through 143 lous
 mehul chaukasee gitanjali james limited kaa pramukh he
 Where is Mehul Chowki, where is he being questioned, who is trying to save him? bank jagat ke karmchaaree baar baar yah massej kar rahe hai ki itane chote str ke karmchaariyon se itnaa bada ghotaalaa sambhav nahin tha
 We cannot give a loan of ten crores
 hazaron karod kaa lone bina bade str ke adhikariyon kii milibhagat ke ho hi nahin saktaa
 All the information is coming from the sources, no one is giving complete information on this, just whose Nirav Modi was the tenant, who bought the diamond from it, the people are being seduced by all these things
 raksha mantri ko yah bataane ke liye aana padaa ki abhishek manu singhvi kii patni ne dedh karod kaa hira karidaa he
 Are they now going to tell who bought the diamond in all these years? kya wo is baat ko lekar aashwast hai ki unki party ke bade netaaon ne vahaan se hira nahin karidaa yaa netaaon ke bachche vahaan kaam nahin karte the
 What the Defense Minister wants to prove under the pretext of daughter and wife
 vaise ab jab pataa chal rahaa he ki neerav modi naam ke frod ne 10 rupee kaa hira 200 main bechaa he to ummid kii jaani chahie ki saare karidaar khud hi rote hue baahar aa jaaenge
 Whose people had given these diamond sets as gifts at weddings, now they will also be crying
 vaise agar nirmala sitaraman press conference karne ai thim to unhen yah bataakar janaa chahie tha ki agast 2016 main register of companez ne visal blor kii shikaayat ko kyon nirast kar diya tha
 While that complaint was forwarded by the PMO
 wo do baaten bataa den
 
 
 Whether a clerk or an officer decides to investigate and revoke a complaint when someone complains, on what basis they decide, she herself has been the Minister of Corporate Affairs

 The Economic Offenses Wing in its investigation did not find a single allegation true
 is bich mumbai main neerav modi ke ghar ke alaava surat ke teen or dilli ke ek thikaane par pravartan nideshaalay ke chaape pade hai
 On the other hand, the CBI also summoned Ravi Gupta, second chief financial officer of Nirav Modi's company, for questioning
 company ke ek or CFO vipul ambani se sibiai ravivaar se poochtacha kar rahi he
 Some suspended officials of the bank have also been questioned by the CBI
 punjab neshnal bank ghotaale ke centre main rahi mumbai kii brady house branch ko pehle sil kar diya gaya lekin baad main sibiai adhikari sil kholkar jaanch ke liye branch ke andar gaye
 Several bank officials were also called there for investigation and questioning
 isi branch se 11,400 karod ke is ghotaale kii buniyaad padi
 One of the main accused in this scam, Gokulnath Shetty, was the deputy manager of the same branch, which is now in CBI custody
 aarope he ki gokulanath shetty kii madad se hi letters of anderstanding jari kiye gaye jinaki madad se neerav modi ke liye videshon main duusare bainkon kii guarantee punjab neshnal bank ne lee
 How the scam was carried out and how many people were involved in it, speculation is going on at different levels right now

 ek aisi vyavastha jisase duniya bhar ke bank aapas main ek code system ke zarie vittiya lenden se judi soochna or nirdeshon kaa surakshit aadan-pradaan karte hai
 Tamal Bandyopadhyay states in his article that at least three officers are needed to smash a bank through SWIFT
 mekar, chekar or verifir
 The maker is the one who inserts the swift-linked message into the system, the checker checks it, and on the third stage the verifier arrives which verifies after the message is satisfied with the check
 lekin teen hi kaafii nahin hai
 Because when a SWIFT message is sent to a bank abroad for financial transaction, that bank sends this message back to the first bank to confirm the loan
 pehle bank main ye massej us vyakti ke paas jaataa he to mekar, chekar or verifir se alag hota he
 This message comes in a secured room and is printed on a separate printer
 is room main jane kii ijazat bahut hi kam logon ko hoti he
 So the question arises whether Gokulnath Shetty played these four roles in Brady House Branch? Can it happen Experts say that this is not possible

 puraskaar dene kii isaki prakriya kya he
 This incident has shocked the image of the Vigilance Commission, provided that it does make a difference to anyone
 khud kendriya satarkta ayukta kevi choudhary ne ye aword apane haathon se die
 Now they are asking him why and how the mess happened
 unhen khud hi janata ke saamne aakar apni baat bataani chahie
 We write the truth by buying a pen made by businessman Vikram Kothari's company Rotomac, but the company Vikram Kothari is not able to pay 3695 crore
 inhone elahabaad bank, bank of india, bank of baroda, indian overseas bank, union bank of india se lone liya tha
 These banks gave loans to Vikram Kothari by following the rules
 lekin ab kothaari na to byaaj chukaa rahe hai naa mul
 Failing to repay the loan in February 2017, the banks declared him a willful defaulter, which was a deliberate inability to repay the loan
 iske baad kothaari or unke parivaar ke logon kii kai sampattiyon ko bainkon ne pichley saal nilaam karne kii karrwai shuru kii taaki apane bakaae kaa kuch hissaa vasuul kiya ja sake
 The rotomac company's office has been locked in the city center of Mall Road, Kanpur for several days
 bank of baroda kii shikaayat ke baad sibiai ne unke kilaaf exiaar daayar kii he or kanpur main unke teen thikaanon par chaape maare hai
 CBI officials are questioning Vikram Kothari, his wife and son
 isse pehle kaha gaya tha ki vikram kothaari bhi videsh bhaag gaye hai lekin ravivaar raat unhen kanpur main ek shaadi samaaroh main dekha gaya
 In response to questions about embezzlement, Kothari said that "I am not running away from the country
" kanpur kaa rahanevaala hum or yaheen rahoonga
 There is no better country than India
 unke mukh mandal se sunakar main saham gaya
 There is no better country than India in taking a loan or is there a better country than India
 darasal sabko pataa he ki hona janaa kuch nahin he
 Such investigation will continue to happen later all the time
 lone na chukaane ke sawaal par kothaari ne kaha ki 'bank se lone zarur liya he, lekin lone na chuktaa karne kii baat galat he
 The case is going on inside the National Company Law Tribunal of mine and the bank
 ' udhar kothaari ke vakil kaa kahana he ki agar koi bank kaa lone naa chukaa paae to ise frod nahin kaha janaa chahie, ye koi aparaadh nahin he
 a well known Pan masala brand Pan Parag belongs to the Vikram Kothari family
 pakora prakaran ke baad neerav modi prakaran ne logon kii kalpanashiltaa ko jagaa diya he
 He is writing all kinds of jogira about Modi
 ek ne likh bheja he ki qarz bhi kitna ajab he, amiron kaa bade to desh chhod jate hai, garibon kaa bade to deh chhod jate hai
 Meanwhile, reports have come that after Gitanjali Gems Limited's Compliance Officer Pankhudi Warange resigned after the scam was exposed, Chief Financial Officer Chandrakant Karkare resigned in the name of his ailing wife
 bihar main isi tarah kaa pichley saal agast main srijan ghotaalaa saamne aayaa tha
 The creation scam was also a banking scam
 2013 main hi bhartiya reserve bank ne likhaa tha ki srijan ke khate kii jaanch ho magar jaanch nahin hui, ghotaalaa chalata rahaa
 Now when the scam came to light, the case went to the CBI
 6 maheene se sibiai jaanch kar rahi he magar srijan ghotaale ke mukhya aaropee giraftaar tak nahin hue hai
 The comments hamaare sahyogi manish kumaar ne report file kii he ki abhi tak srijan ghotaale ke mukhya abhiyukt priya or amit faraar hai
 The CBI has not yet taken a warrant for his arrest
 1500 karod ke is ghotaale ko lekar sibiai kii yah raftaar he
 When the government's plans reached Bhagalpur, the District Magistrate used to cut the check and give it to the branch of Bank of Baroda, Bhagalpur, to deposit the money in the account of the institution called Srujan
 vahaan se paisa nikalataa tha or logon main bant jaataa tha
 This is such a scam, if it was investigated quickly, then other states would also be affected, but everything is growing like slow news
 bihar main sarkaar badal gai he or srijan ghotaale kii baat dhimi pad gai he
 If CBI could not arrest the main accused in 6 months then what to say, while CBI has so far filed 5 charge sheets, 2 supplementary charge sheets
 abhi to jaanch main tezi aa rahi he
 After two to three days when the focus of the media will change, the creation of the Punjab National Bank scam will also be similar to the creation scam
 bihar jaise garib rajya main koi 1500 karod lut le jaae or kisi ko fark hi na pade to garibon kaa bhagwaan hi maalik he
 Bank employees are repeatedly messaging that such a big scam was not possible with such a small level of employees
 ham log das karod kaa lone tak nahin de sakate hai
 Thousands of crores of loans cannot be done without the involvement of high level officials
 sari jaankaree sutron ke hawaale se aa rahi he, koi is par mukammal jaankaree nahin de rahaa he, bas neerav modi kiskaa kiraayedaar tha, kisne usase hira karidaa, in sab baton se janata ko bahalaaya ja rahaa he
 The Defense Minister had to come to tell that Abhishek Manu Singhvi's wife had bought a diamond worth Rs 1
5 crore
 kya ab ve yah bhi bataane vaali hai ki itane saalon main kis kis ne hira karidaa
 Are they convinced that the big leaders of their party did not buy diamonds from there or that the children of the leaders did not work there
 beti or bivi ke bahaane raksha mantri kya sabit karnaa chaahati hai
 By the way, now that it is known that a fraud named Nirav Modi has sold a diamond of 10 rupees for 200, then it should be expected that all the buyers will come out crying themselves
 jinke yahaan shaadiyon main in logon ne heere kaa set tohfe main diya hoga ab ve bhi ro rahe honge
 By the way, if Nirmala Sitharaman had come to the press conference, she should have told why the Registrar of Companies had canceled the whistle blower complaint in August 2016
 jabaki wo shikaayat piemo ne forverd kii thi
 Let me tell you two things
 
 
 kya jab koi shikaayat karata he to uski jaanch or nirast karne kaa faisalaa koi clerk letaa he yaa koi adhikari letaa he, kis aadhaar par faisalaa hota he, ve khud bhi karporate maamalon ke mantri rahi hai
 Not only this, Santosh Srivastava resigned from Geetanjali Limited in 2013 and made complaints when Mehul Choksi called and threatened him
 unki selary kaa bakaayaa aaj tak nahin diya
 a fake case was done in which Santosh was acquitted
 aarthik aparaadh shakha ne apni jaanch main ek bhi aarope sahi nahin paaya
 Meanwhile, besides Nirav Modi's house in Mumbai, three Surat and one Delhi locations have been raided by the Enforcement Directorate
 udhar sibiai ne neerav modi kii company ke duusare cheef financial ofisar ravi gupta ko bhi poochtacha ke liye saman kiya
 The CBI is questioning Vipul Ambani, another CFO of the company, since Sunday
 bank ke kuch nilambit adhikariyon se bhi sibiai ne poochtacha kii he
 Mumbai's Brady House branch, which was at the center of the Punjab National Bank scam, was first sealed but later CBI officials opened the seal and went inside the branch for investigation
 kai bank adhikariyon ko bhi vahaan jaanch or poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa gaya
 From this branch, the scam of 11,400 crores was laid
 is ghotaale kaa ek mukhya aaropee gokulanath shetty isi branch kaa dipti manager tha jo ab sibiai kii hiraasat main he
 It is alleged that the letter of understanding was issued with the help of Gokulnath Shetty, with the help of which Punjab National Bank guaranteed other banks abroad for Nirav Modi
 is ghotaale ko kaise anjaam diya gaya or isamen kul kitne logon kii sathganth thi ise lekar abhi alag alag staron par kayaas hi chal rahe hai
 Tamal Bandyopadhyay in Live Mint has tried to explain this scam in his report
 pehle SWIFT ko samajhie yani Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications
 a system whereby banks around the world securely exchange information and instructions related to financial transactions through a code system among themselves
 tamal bandyopadhyaay apane lekh main kehete hai ki ki SWIFT ke zarie kisi bank ko dharashayi karne ke liye kam se kam teen adhikariyon kii zarurat hoti he
 Maker, Checker and Verifier
 mekar wo hota he jo system main SWIFT se judaa massej daalata he, chekar isaki jaanch karata he or teesri stage par verifir aata he jo massej kii jaanch se santusht hone ke baad veriphai karata he
 But three are not enough
 kyonki vittiya lenden ke liye SWIFT massej jab videsh main kisi bank ko bheja jaataa he to wo bank lone ko conform karne ke liye is massej ko waapas pehle bank main bhejtaa he
 In the first bank, this message goes to the person, then it is different from the maker, checker and the verifier
 ye massej ek secyord room main aata he or ek alag printer par print hota he
 Very few people are allowed to visit this room
 to sawaal ye uthta he ki kya brady house branch main gokulanath shetty ne ye chaaron bhoomikaayen nibhaain? kya aisa ho saktaa he? jaankaron kaa kahana he ki ye sambhav nahin he
 Many bigger people will definitely have a role in this matter which will come up in further investigation
 shila bhatta maahir patrkaar hai, unhone 1980 se 1997 tak yani 17 saal hira kaarobaar kii report kii he
 Sheelaji has written a report in the Sunday Guardian newspaper
 us report ke ek hisse kaa anuwaad kar rahaa hum
 
 
 'A large diamond trader in Surat has not been paying any interest on the loan of more than 4000 crores for the last six months
 usne yah lone privet bank se liye hai
 The bank's breath is stuck so that it does not run away from the shop
 yah vahi aadmi he jisane kuch saal pehle apane sabhi karmchaariyon ko car tohafe main di thi
 When we read this story, we too were stunned
 
 
 hamane bhi ek aise hira vyapaaree kii kahani dikhaai thi
 Is he the same diamond merchant about whom Sheela Bhatt is pointing? jab usne car gift kii thi tab media main uski dhooma much gai thi
 Can Indian businessmen not achieve success without theft? a diamond trader from Sheela Bhatt has said that for fifty years, diamond business runs at 90 per cent black money
 zaahir he aaj bhi chal hi rahaa hoga
 
 
 Another part of their article is, 'big diamond businessmen knew that the business of Mehul and Nirav was going to collapse, but they did not even know that they would do this game with the help of letter of undertaking
 maal kii qeemat zyaada bataanaa, bill main kam dikhaanaa, smagaling kaa maal kareednaa bechnaa, tex chori karnaa yah sab to chalata he magar letters of anderstanding kaa idia kisi ko nahin tha
 Even these diamond traders do not understand how Nirav and Mehul achieved such a letter of undertaking
 ' This incident has brought the diamond trade in doubt
 isaki chamak ke peeche kaa andhera bataa rahaa he ki ham sab kitne bhole hai
 By dazzling, the hoaxers are still collecting all the goods
 is bich quint hindi ke sampadakeey nideshak or varisht patrkaar sanjay pugaliya ne twit kiya he ki 'neerav modi ne apane bacchon kaa mumbai ke skulon se chah maheene pehle hi naam katwa liya tha jab skool satr ke bich main hi the

 CVC called Punjab National Bank officials for questioning
 
 
 khaas baat ye he ki isi sivisi ne beete teen saal main teen baar banking main satarkta baratane ke liye punjab neshnal bank ko aword diye hai
 Two of these awards were given to Punjab National Bank last year, the year in which PNB issued 293 lous to Nirav Modi and his family
 is sivisi se hi poocha janaa chahie ki wo satarkta puraskaar kaise detaa he
 What is its process of awarding
 is ghatana se satarkta ayog kii chhavi ko kitna dhakka pahunchaa he, basharte is dhakke se kisi ko fark padataa ho
 Central Vigilance Commissioner KV Chaudhary presented the awards with his own hands

 They should themselves come out in front of the public and tell their views
 kaarobaari vikram kothaari kii company rotomac kii banaai kalam kareed kar ham log sach likhte hai magar company vaale vikram kothaari 3695 karod nahin chukaa paa rahe hai
 He took loans from Allahabad Bank, Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Indian Overseas Bank, Union Bank of India
 in bainkon ne niyamon ko taak par rakhkar vikram kothaari ko lone diya
 But now Kothari is neither paying interest nor origin
 farvari 2017 main lone chukaane main naakaam rahane par bainkon ne unhen vilphul difolter ghoshit kiya yani jo jaanboojhkar lone chukaane main asamarthta jataae
 After this, banks started the auction of various properties of Kothari and his family members last year to recover some of their dues
 kanpur ke maal road ke city centre main rotomac company ke ofis par kai dinon se taala band he
 Following the complaint of the Bank of Baroda, the CBI has filed an FIR against him and raided his three locations in Kanpur
 vikram kothaari, unki patni or bete se sibiai ke afasar poochtacha kar rahe hai
 Earlier it was said that Vikram Kothari has also fled abroad but he was seen at a wedding ceremony in Kanpur on Sunday night
 gaban ko lekar sawaalon ke jawaab main kothaari ne kaha ki 'main desh chhodkar bhaag nahin rahaa hum
 i am from Kanpur and will live here
 bharat se behatar koi desh nahin he
 i was aghast after hearing from his mouth
 lone lekar gaban karne main bharat se behatar koi desh nahin he yaa vaaki bharat se behatar koi desh nahin he
 Actually everyone knows that it is nothing to be
 aise hi jaanch vaanch hoti rahegi baad main sab rafa dfa
 On the question of not repaying the loan, Kothari said that 'I have taken a loan from the bank, but it is wrong to not repay the loan
 meraa or bank kaa neshnal company lau tribunel ke andar cese chal rahaa he
 On the other hand, Kothari's lawyer says that if a bank does not repay the loan, it should not be called fraud, it is not a crime

 The Nirav Modi episode after the Pakoda episode has awakened people's imagination
 wo modi ko lekar tarah-tarah kaa jogira sara raara likh rahe hai
 One has written that the debt is so strange, if the rich grow, they leave the country, and if the poor grow, they leave the body
 is bich khabar ai he ki ghotaale ke ujagar hone ke baad gitanjali james limited kii complayens adhikari pankhudi warrange ne antaratma kii awaz par or chif financial afasar chandrakant karkare ne biimaar patni ke naam par istipha de diya he
 a similar creation scandal came to light in Bihar in August last year
 srijan ghotaalaa bhi banking ghotaalaa tha
 In 2013 itself, the Reserve Bank of India wrote that the creation account should be investigated but not investigated, the scam continued
 ab jab ghotaalaa saamne aayaa to maamla sibiai ke paas gaya
 The CBI has been investigating for 6 months but the main accused in the creation scam have not even been arrested
 tippaniyan Our colleague Manish Kumar has filed a report that so far the main accused in the creation scam are Priya and Amit absconding
 sibiai ne abhi tak giraftaar ke liye warrant tak nahin liya he
 This is the speed of CBI regarding this 1500 crore scam
 sarkaar kii yojanaayen jab bhagalpur pahunchati thim to ziladhikari check kaat kar bhagalpur ke bank of baroda kii shakha ko dete the ki paisa srijan naam kii sanstha ke khate main jamaa kara diya jaae
 Money used to flow from there and was distributed among the people
 yah aisa ghotaalaa he agar isaki tezi se jaanch hoti to duusare rajyon par bhi asar padataa magar sab kuch dhimi gati ke samachar kii tarah bad rahaa he
 The government has changed in Bihar and the creation scandal has slowed down
 6 maheene main sibiai mukhya abhiyukt ko giraftaar na kar sake to kya kaha jaae jabaki sibiai abhi tak 5 chargeshit, 2 supplementry chargeshit daayar kar chuki he
 Right now the investigation is taking place
 do teen dinon baad jab media kaa focus badalegaa to punjab neshnal bank ke ghotaale kaa haal bhi srijan ghotaale ke jaisaa ho jayega
 In a poor state like Bihar, if someone takes 1500 crores of loot, and no matter what, then God is the owner of the poor
 raksha mantri ko yah bataane ke liye aana padaa ki abhishek manu singhvi kii patni ne dedh karod kaa hira karidaa he
 Are they now going to tell who bought the diamond in all these years? kya wo is baat ko lekar aashwast hai ki unki party ke bade netaaon ne vahaan se hira nahin karidaa yaa netaaon ke bachche vahaan kaam nahin karte the
 What the Defense Minister wants to prove under the pretext of daughter and wife
 vaise ab jab pataa chal rahaa he ki neerav modi naam ke frod ne 10 rupee kaa hira 200 main bechaa he to ummid kii jaani chahie ki saare karidaar khud hi rote hue baahar aa jaaenge
 Whose people had given these diamond sets as gifts at weddings, now they will also be crying
 vaise agar nirmala sitaraman press conference karne ai thim to unhen yah bataakar janaa chahie tha ki agast 2016 main register of companez ne visal blor kii shikaayat ko kyon nirast kar diya tha
 While that complaint was forwarded by the PMO
 wo do baaten bataa den
 
 
 Whether a clerk or an officer decides to investigate and revoke a complaint when someone complains, on what basis they decide, she herself has been the Minister of Corporate Affairs

 The Economic Offenses Wing in its investigation did not find a single allegation true
 is bich mumbai main neerav modi ke ghar ke alaava surat ke teen or dilli ke ek thikaane par pravartan nideshaalay ke chaape pade hai
 On the other hand, the CBI also summoned Ravi Gupta, second chief financial officer of Nirav Modi's company, for questioning
 company ke ek or CFO vipul ambani se sibiai ravivaar se poochtacha kar rahi he
 Some suspended officials of the bank have also been questioned by the CBI
 punjab neshnal bank ghotaale ke centre main rahi mumbai kii brady house branch ko pehle sil kar diya gaya lekin baad main sibiai adhikari sil kholkar jaanch ke liye branch ke andar gaye
 Several bank officials were also called there for investigation and questioning
 isi branch se 11,400 karod ke is ghotaale kii buniyaad padi
 One of the main accused in this scam, Gokulnath Shetty, was the deputy manager of the same branch, which is now in CBI custody
 aarope he ki gokulanath shetty kii madad se hi letters of anderstanding jari kiye gaye jinaki madad se neerav modi ke liye videshon main duusare bainkon kii guarantee punjab neshnal bank ne lee
 How the scam was carried out and how many people were involved in it, speculation is going on at different levels right now
 Live Mint main tamal bandyopadhyaay ne apni report main is ghotaale ko samajhane kii koshish kii he
 First understand SWIFT i
e
 Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications
 ek aisi vyavastha jisase duniya bhar ke bank aapas main ek code system ke zarie vittiya lenden se judi soochna or nirdeshon kaa surakshit aadan-pradaan karte hai
 Tamal Bandyopadhyay states in his article that at least three officers are needed to smash a bank through SWIFT
 mekar, chekar or verifir
 The maker is the one who inserts the swift-linked message into the system, the checker checks it, and on the third stage the verifier arrives which verifies after the message is satisfied with the check
 lekin teen hi kaafii nahin hai
 Because when a SWIFT message is sent to a bank abroad for financial transaction, that bank sends this message back to the first bank to confirm the loan
 pehle bank main ye massej us vyakti ke paas jaataa he to mekar, chekar or verifir se alag hota he
 This message comes in a secured room and is printed on a separate printer
 is room main jane kii ijazat bahut hi kam logon ko hoti he
 So the question arises whether Gokulnath Shetty played these four roles in Brady House Branch? Can it happen Experts say that this is not possible
 is maamle main kai or bade logon kii nishchit hi bhoomika hogi jo aage kii jaanch main saamne aegi
 Sheela Bhatt is an expert journalist, she has reported diamond business for 17 years from 1980 to 1997
 shilajee ne sande gardian akhbaar main ek report likhi he
 Translating a part of that report
 
 
 'surat main ek bada hira kaarobaari pichley chah maheene se 4000 karod se adhik ke qarz par koi byaaj nahin de rahaa he
 He has taken these loans from a private bank
 bank kii saans ataki hui he ki kahin wo dukaan band kar bhaag naa jaae
 This is the same man who gifted the car to all his employees a few years ago
 is kahani ko padhaa to ham bhi saham gaye
 
 
 We too had shown the story of one such diamond merchant
 kya vahi hira vyapaaree he jiske bare main shila bhatta ishaara kar rahi hai
 When he gifted the car, it was created in the media
 kya bhartiya kaarobaari bagair chori ke safalataa kaa mukaam hasil nahin kar sakate hai? shila bhatta se ek hira vyapaaree ne kaha he ki pachaas saal se heere kaa kaarobaar 90 fisadi blike mani par chalata he
 Obviously it must be going on even today
 
 
 unke lekh kaa ek or hissaa he, 'bade hira kaarobaariyon ko pataa tha ki mehul or neerav kaa dhandha chaupat hone vaala he lekin unhen bhi pataa nahin tha ki wo letters of anderteking ke sahare ye khel karenge
 It is all about telling the price of the goods, showing less in the bill, selling smuggling goods, tax evasion, but no one had the idea of letter of understanding
 in hira kaarobaariyon ko bhi samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki neerav or mehul ne itane letters of anderteking kaise hasil kar liye
 ' is ghatana ne hira vyapaar ko hi andeh ke ghere main laa diya he
 The darkness behind its glow is telling us how naive we are

 Meanwhile, Quint Hindi editorial director and senior journalist Sanjay Puglia has tweeted that 'nirav Modi got his children removed from the schools in Mumbai six months ago when the school was in the middle of the session

 Meanwhile, besides Nirav Modi's house in Mumbai, three Surat and one Delhi locations have been raided by the Enforcement Directorate
 udhar sibiai ne neerav modi kii company ke duusare cheef financial ofisar ravi gupta ko bhi poochtacha ke liye saman kiya
 The CBI is questioning Vipul Ambani, another CFO of the company, since Sunday 
 bank ke kuch nilambit adhikariyon se bhi sibiai ne poochtacha kii he
 Mumbai's Brady House branch, which was at the center of the Punjab National Bank scam, was first sealed but later CBI officials opened the seal and went inside the branch for investigation
 kai bank adhikariyon ko bhi vahaan jaanch or poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa gaya
 From this branch, the scam of 11,400 crores was laid
 is ghotaale kaa ek mukhya aaropee gokulanath shetty isi branch kaa dipti manager tha jo ab sibiai kii hiraasat main he
 It is alleged that the letter of understanding was issued with the help of Gokulnath Shetty, with the help of which Punjab National Bank guaranteed other banks abroad for Nirav Modi
 is ghotaale ko kaise anjaam diya gaya or isamen kul kitne logon kii sathganth thi ise lekar abhi alag alag staron par kayaas hi chal rahe hai
 Tamal Bandyopadhyay in Live Mint has tried to explain this scam in his report
 pehle SWIFT ko samajhie yani Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications
 a system whereby banks around the world securely exchange information and instructions related to financial transactions through a code system among themselves
 tamal bandyopadhyaay apane lekh main kehete hai ki ki SWIFT ke zarie kisi bank ko dharashayi karne ke liye kam se kam teen adhikariyon kii zarurat hoti he
 Maker, Checker and Verifier
 mekar wo hota he jo system main SWIFT se judaa massej daalata he, chekar isaki jaanch karata he or teesri stage par verifir aata he jo massej kii jaanch se santusht hone ke baad veriphai karata he
 But three are not enough
 kyonki vittiya lenden ke liye SWIFT massej jab videsh main kisi bank ko bheja jaataa he to wo bank lone ko conform karne ke liye is massej ko waapas pehle bank main bhejtaa he
 In the first bank, this message goes to the person, then it is different from the maker, checker and the verifier
 ye massej ek secyord room main aata he or ek alag printer par print hota he
 Very few people are allowed to visit this room
 to sawaal ye uthta he ki kya brady house branch main gokulanath shetty ne ye chaaron bhoomikaayen nibhaain? kya aisa ho saktaa he? jaankaron kaa kahana he ki ye sambhav nahin he
 Many bigger people will definitely have a role in this matter which will come up in further investigation
 shila bhatta maahir patrkaar hai, unhone 1980 se 1997 tak yani 17 saal hira kaarobaar kii report kii he
 Sheelaji has written a report in the Sunday Guardian newspaper
 us report ke ek hisse kaa anuwaad kar rahaa hum
 
 
 'A large diamond trader in Surat has not been paying any interest on the loan of more than 4000 crores for the last six months
 usne yah lone privet bank se liye hai
 The bank's breath is stuck so that it does not run away from the shop
 yah vahi aadmi he jisane kuch saal pehle apane sabhi karmchaariyon ko car tohafe main di thi
 When we read this story, we too were stunned
 
 
 hamane bhi ek aise hira vyapaaree kii kahani dikhaai thi
 Is he the same diamond merchant about whom Sheela Bhatt is pointing? jab usne car gift kii thi tab media main uski dhooma much gai thi
 Can Indian businessmen not achieve success without theft? a diamond trader from Sheela Bhatt has said that for fifty years, diamond business runs at 90 per cent black money
 zaahir he aaj bhi chal hi rahaa hoga
 
 
 Another part of their article is, 'big diamond businessmen knew that the business of Mehul and Nirav was going to collapse, but they did not even know that they would do this game with the help of letter of undertaking
 maal kii qeemat zyaada bataanaa, bill main kam dikhaanaa, smagaling kaa maal kareednaa bechnaa, tex chori karnaa yah sab to chalata he magar letters of anderstanding kaa idia kisi ko nahin tha
 Even these diamond traders do not understand how Nirav and Mehul achieved such a letter of undertaking
 ' This incident has brought the diamond trade in doubt
 isaki chamak ke peeche kaa andhera bataa rahaa he ki ham sab kitne bhole hai
 By dazzling, the hoaxers are still collecting all the goods
 is bich quint hindi ke sampadakeey nideshak or varisht patrkaar sanjay pugaliya ne twit kiya he ki 'neerav modi ne apane bacchon kaa mumbai ke skulon se chah maheene pehle hi naam katwa liya tha jab skool satr ke bich main hi the
 The children moved to America with their mother
 kaarobaari parivaar hairaan the ki aisa kyon hua
 Now they know the reason
 ' So there was complete preparation to escape

 Meanwhile, Central Vigilance Commission i

 CVC called Punjab National Bank officials for questioning
 
 
 khaas baat ye he ki isi sivisi ne beete teen saal main teen baar banking main satarkta baratane ke liye punjab neshnal bank ko aword diye hai
 Two of these awards were given to Punjab National Bank last year, the year in which PNB issued 293 lous to Nirav Modi and his family
 is sivisi se hi poocha janaa chahie ki wo satarkta puraskaar kaise detaa he
 What is its process of awarding
 is ghatana se satarkta ayog kii chhavi ko kitna dhakka pahunchaa he, basharte is dhakke se kisi ko fark padataa ho
 Central Vigilance Commissioner KV Chaudhary presented the awards with his own hands
 ab vahi unase puch rahe hai ki gadabadi kyon or kaise ho gai
 They should themselves come out in front of the public and tell their views
 kaarobaari vikram kothaari kii company rotomac kii banaai kalam kareed kar ham log sach likhte hai magar company vaale vikram kothaari 3695 karod nahin chukaa paa rahe hai
 He took loans from Allahabad Bank, Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Indian Overseas Bank, Union Bank of India
 in bainkon ne niyamon ko taak par rakhkar vikram kothaari ko lone diya
 But now Kothari is neither paying interest nor origin
 farvari 2017 main lone chukaane main naakaam rahane par bainkon ne unhen vilphul difolter ghoshit kiya yani jo jaanboojhkar lone chukaane main asamarthta jataae
 After this, banks started the auction of various properties of Kothari and his family members last year to recover some of their dues
 kanpur ke maal road ke city centre main rotomac company ke ofis par kai dinon se taala band he
 Following the complaint of the Bank of Baroda, the CBI has filed an FIR against him and raided his three locations in Kanpur
 vikram kothaari, unki patni or bete se sibiai ke afasar poochtacha kar rahe hai
 Earlier it was said that Vikram Kothari has also fled abroad but he was seen at a wedding ceremony in Kanpur on Sunday night
 gaban ko lekar sawaalon ke jawaab main kothaari ne kaha ki 'main desh chhodkar bhaag nahin rahaa hum
 i am from Kanpur and will live here
 bharat se behatar koi desh nahin he
 i was aghast after hearing from his mouth
 lone lekar gaban karne main bharat se behatar koi desh nahin he yaa vaaki bharat se behatar koi desh nahin he
 Actually everyone knows that it is nothing to be
 aise hi jaanch vaanch hoti rahegi baad main sab rafa dfa
 On the question of not repaying the loan, Kothari said that 'I have taken a loan from the bank, but it is wrong to not repay the loan
 meraa or bank kaa neshnal company lau tribunel ke andar cese chal rahaa he
 On the other hand, Kothari's lawyer says that if a bank does not repay the loan, it should not be called fraud, it is not a crime
 ek janaa pahachaanaa paan masala brands paan paraag vikram kothaari parivaar kaa hi he
 The Nirav Modi episode after the Pakoda episode has awakened people's imagination
 wo modi ko lekar tarah-tarah kaa jogira sara raara likh rahe hai
 One has written that the debt is so strange, if the rich grow, they leave the country, and if the poor grow, they leave the body
 is bich khabar ai he ki ghotaale ke ujagar hone ke baad gitanjali james limited kii complayens adhikari pankhudi warrange ne antaratma kii awaz par or chif financial afasar chandrakant karkare ne biimaar patni ke naam par istipha de diya he
 a similar creation scandal came to light in Bihar in August last year
 srijan ghotaalaa bhi banking ghotaalaa tha
 In 2013 itself, the Reserve Bank of India wrote that the creation account should be investigated but not investigated, the scam continued
 ab jab ghotaalaa saamne aayaa to maamla sibiai ke paas gaya
 The CBI has been investigating for 6 months but the main accused in the creation scam have not even been arrested
 tippaniyan Our colleague Manish Kumar has filed a report that so far the main accused in the creation scam are Priya and Amit absconding
 sibiai ne abhi tak giraftaar ke liye warrant tak nahin liya he
 This is the speed of CBI regarding this 1500 crore scam
 sarkaar kii yojanaayen jab bhagalpur pahunchati thim to ziladhikari check kaat kar bhagalpur ke bank of baroda kii shakha ko dete the ki paisa srijan naam kii sanstha ke khate main jamaa kara diya jaae
 Money used to flow from there and was distributed among the people
 yah aisa ghotaalaa he agar isaki tezi se jaanch hoti to duusare rajyon par bhi asar padataa magar sab kuch dhimi gati ke samachar kii tarah bad rahaa he
 The government has changed in Bihar and the creation scandal has slowed down
 6 maheene main sibiai mukhya abhiyukt ko giraftaar na kar sake to kya kaha jaae jabaki sibiai abhi tak 5 chargeshit, 2 supplementry chargeshit daayar kar chuki he
 Right now the investigation is taking place
 do teen dinon baad jab media kaa focus badalegaa to punjab neshnal bank ke ghotaale kaa haal bhi srijan ghotaale ke jaisaa ho jayega
 In a poor state like Bihar, if someone takes 1500 crores of loot, and no matter what, then God is the owner of the poor
 is bich mumbai main neerav modi ke ghar ke alaava surat ke teen or dilli ke ek thikaane par pravartan nideshaalay ke chaape pade hai
 On the other hand, the CBI also summoned Ravi Gupta, second chief financial officer of Nirav Modi's company, for questioning
 company ke ek or CFO vipul ambani se sibiai ravivaar se poochtacha kar rahi he
 Some suspended officials of the bank have also been questioned by the CBI
 punjab neshnal bank ghotaale ke centre main rahi mumbai kii brady house branch ko pehle sil kar diya gaya lekin baad main sibiai adhikari sil kholkar jaanch ke liye branch ke andar gaye
 Several bank officials were also called there for investigation and questioning
 isi branch se 11,400 karod ke is ghotaale kii buniyaad padi
 One of the main accused in this scam, Gokulnath Shetty, was the deputy manager of the same branch, which is now in CBI custody
 aarope he ki gokulanath shetty kii madad se hi letters of anderstanding jari kiye gaye jinaki madad se neerav modi ke liye videshon main duusare bainkon kii guarantee punjab neshnal bank ne lee
 How the scam was carried out and how many people were involved in it, speculation is going on at different levels right now
 Live Mint main tamal bandyopadhyaay ne apni report main is ghotaale ko samajhane kii koshish kii he

 Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications
 ek aisi vyavastha jisase duniya bhar ke bank aapas main ek code system ke zarie vittiya lenden se judi soochna or nirdeshon kaa surakshit aadan-pradaan karte hai
 Tamal Bandyopadhyay states in his article that at least three officers are needed to smash a bank through SWIFT
 mekar, chekar or verifir
 The maker is the one who inserts the swift-linked message into the system, the checker checks it, and on the third stage the verifier arrives which verifies after the message is satisfied with the check
 lekin teen hi kaafii nahin hai
 Because when a SWIFT message is sent to a bank abroad for financial transaction, that bank sends this message back to the first bank to confirm the loan
 pehle bank main ye massej us vyakti ke paas jaataa he to mekar, chekar or verifir se alag hota he
 This message comes in a secured room and is printed on a separate printer
 is room main jane kii ijazat bahut hi kam logon ko hoti he
 So the question arises whether Gokulnath Shetty played these four roles in Brady House Branch? Can it happen Experts say that this is not possible

 The creation scam was also a banking scam
 2013 main hi bhartiya reserve bank ne likhaa tha ki srijan ke khate kii jaanch ho magar jaanch nahin hui, ghotaalaa chalata rahaa
 Now when the scam came to light, the case went to the CBI
 6 maheene se sibiai jaanch kar rahi he magar srijan ghotaale ke mukhya aaropee giraftaar tak nahin hue hai
 The comments hamaare sahyogi manish kumaar ne report file kii he ki abhi tak srijan ghotaale ke mukhya abhiyukt priya or amit faraar hai
 The CBI has not yet taken a warrant for his arrest
 1500 karod ke is ghotaale ko lekar sibiai kii yah raftaar he
 When the government's plans reached Bhagalpur, the District Magistrate used to cut the check and give it to the branch of Bank of Baroda, Bhagalpur, to deposit the money in the account of the institution called Srujan
 vahaan se paisa nikalataa tha or logon main bant jaataa tha
 This is such a scam, if it was investigated quickly, then other states would also be affected, but everything is growing like slow news

 If CBI could not arrest the main accused in 6 months then what to say, while CBI has so far filed 5 charge sheets, 2 supplementary charge sheets
 abhi to jaanch main tezi aa rahi he
 After two to three days when the focus of the media will change, the creation of the Punjab National Bank scam will also be similar to the creation scam

 'A large diamond trader in Surat has not been paying any interest on the loan of more than 4000 crores for the last six months

 Can Indian businessmen not achieve success without theft? a diamond trader from Sheela Bhatt has said that for fifty years, diamond business runs at 90 per cent black money

 Another part of their article is, 'big diamond businessmen knew that the business of Mehul and Nirav was going to collapse, but they did not even know that they would do this game with the help of letter of undertaking

 After this, banks started the auction of various properties of Kothari and his family members last year to recover some of their dues

 Following the complaint of the Bank of Baroda, the CBI has filed an FIR against him and raided his three locations in Kanpur
 vikram kothaari, unki patni or bete se sibiai ke afasar poochtacha kar rahe hai
 Earlier it was said that Vikram Kothari has also fled abroad but he was seen at a wedding ceremony in Kanpur on Sunday night

 On the question of not repaying the loan, Kothari said that 'I have taken a loan from the bank, but it is wrong to not repay the loan

 On the other hand, Kothari's lawyer says that if a bank does not repay the loan, it should not be called fraud, it is not a crime

 a similar creation scandal came to light in Bihar in August last year
 srijan ghotaalaa bhi banking ghotaalaa tha
 In 2013 itself, the Reserve Bank of India wrote that the creation account should be investigated but not investigated, the scam continued
 ab jab ghotaalaa saamne aayaa to maamla sibiai ke paas gaya
 The CBI has been investigating for 6 months but the main accused in the creation scam have not even been arrested
 tippaniyan Our colleague Manish Kumar has filed a report that so far the main accused in the creation scam are Priya and Amit absconding
 sibiai ne abhi tak giraftaar ke liye warrant tak nahin liya he
 This is the speed of CBI regarding this 1500 crore scam

 Right now the investigation is taking place
 do teen dinon baad jab media kaa focus badalegaa to punjab neshnal bank ke ghotaale kaa haal bhi srijan ghotaale ke jaisaa ho jayega
 In a poor state like Bihar, if someone takes 1500 crores of loot, and no matter what, then God is the owner of the poor
 is kahani ko padhaa to ham bhi saham gaye
 
 
 We too had shown the story of one such diamond merchant
 kya vahi hira vyapaaree he jiske bare main shila bhatta ishaara kar rahi hai
 When he gifted the car, it was created in the media
 kya bhartiya kaarobaari bagair chori ke safalataa kaa mukaam hasil nahin kar sakate hai? shila bhatta se ek hira vyapaaree ne kaha he ki pachaas saal se heere kaa kaarobaar 90 fisadi blike mani par chalata he
 Obviously it must be going on even today
 
 
 unke lekh kaa ek or hissaa he, 'bade hira kaarobaariyon ko pataa tha ki mehul or neerav kaa dhandha chaupat hone vaala he lekin unhen bhi pataa nahin tha ki wo letters of anderteking ke sahare ye khel karenge
 It is all about telling the price of the goods, showing less in the bill, selling smuggling goods, tax evasion, but no one had the idea of letter of understanding
 in hira kaarobaariyon ko bhi samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki neerav or mehul ne itane letters of anderteking kaise hasil kar liye
 ' is ghatana ne hira vyapaar ko hi andeh ke ghere main laa diya he
 The darkness behind its glow is telling us how naive we are

 Meanwhile, Quint Hindi editorial director and senior journalist Sanjay Puglia has tweeted that 'nirav Modi got his children removed from the schools in Mumbai six months ago when the school was in the middle of the session

 The special thing is that this CVC has given Punjab National Bank three times in the last three years to be vigilant in banking
 iname se do aword pichley hi saal punjab neshnal bank ko die gaye jis saal pienbi ne neerav modi or unke parivaar ko 293 aloyu jari kiye
 This CVC should be asked only how it gives the Vigilance Award

 This incident has shocked the image of the Vigilance Commission, provided that it does make a difference to anyone

 Failing to repay the loan in February 2017, the banks declared him a willful defaulter, which was a deliberate inability to repay the loan

 inhone elahabaad bank, bank of india, bank of baroda, indian overseas bank, union bank of india se lone liya tha
 These banks gave loans to Vikram Kothari by following the rules
 lekin ab kothaari na to byaaj chukaa rahe hai naa mul
 Failing to repay the loan in February 2017, the banks declared him a willful defaulter, which was a deliberate inability to repay the loan

 In response to questions about embezzlement, Kothari said that "I am not running away from the country
" kanpur kaa rahanevaala hum or yaheen rahoonga
 There is no better country than India
 unke mukh mandal se sunakar main saham gaya
 There is no better country than India in taking a loan or is there a better country than India

 Meanwhile, reports have come that after Gitanjali Gems Limited's Compliance Officer Pankhudi Warange resigned after the scam was exposed, Chief Financial Officer Chandrakant Karkare resigned in the name of his ailing wife
 bihar main isi tarah kaa pichley saal agast main srijan ghotaalaa saamne aayaa tha
 The creation scam was also a banking scam
 2013 main hi bhartiya reserve bank ne likhaa tha ki srijan ke khate kii jaanch ho magar jaanch nahin hui, ghotaalaa chalata rahaa
 Now when the scam came to light, the case went to the CBI
 6 maheene se sibiai jaanch kar rahi he magar srijan ghotaale ke mukhya aaropee giraftaar tak nahin hue hai
 The comments hamaare sahyogi manish kumaar ne report file kii he ki abhi tak srijan ghotaale ke mukhya abhiyukt priya or amit faraar hai

 This is such a scam, if it was investigated quickly, then other states would also be affected, but everything is growing like slow news

 If CBI could not arrest the main accused in 6 months then what to say, while CBI has so far filed 5 charge sheets, 2 supplementary charge sheets

 After two to three days when the focus of the media will change, the creation of the Punjab National Bank scam will also be similar to the creation scam

 madhya pradesh kii kamalnath sarkaar ke afasaron ne bijli ko lekar behad ajeebogareeb bayaan diya he
 He has blamed the bats for the power cuts
 saath hi apni jimmedaari se pallaa jhaadne kii koshish kii he
 Let us tell you that in the scorching heat, the people of Madhya Pradesh are suffering from power cuts
 isko lekar kamalnath sarkaar par lagaataar sawaal uth rahe hai
 Earlier, the Kamal Nath government had blamed poor transformers purchased in the Shivraj government for power cuts
 ab kamalnath sarkaar ke adhikariyon ne apni naakaami ko chhipaane ko bijli katautee ke liye pedo main latakane vaale chamagaadadon ko jimmedaar bataa rahe hai
 Troubled by the power crisis, when Power Minister Priyavrat Singh called a meeting of the officials of the Department of Power, the officials of the Department of Power said that bats hang upside down on the electrical wires, due to which the electrical wires stick together and fault
 Go
 adhikariyon kii ye baat na aam logon ke gale nahin utar rahi he or na hi unke mantralay ke mantri priyavrat singh ke
 Speaking to Aaj Tak, Energy Minister Priyavrat Singh said, 'when the officials of the electricity department told in the meeting that bats live in large numbers in old Bhopal, due to which there are many faults in the electric wires
 bataur urja mantri unhone afasaron se kaha ki wo chamagaadadon ko bijli ke taron se dur rakhane ke liye ultrasonic divaais lagane par vichaar karen, lekin isse pehle transformar par padane vaale lod ko bhi kam karen
 Also insulate the wires
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki bijli kii samasya ko lekar bulaai gai baithak main adhikariyon ne jo bataaya maine us par yakeen nahin kiya
 Let us tell you that before Kamal Nath, there was a Bharatiya Janata Party government in Madhya Pradesh for the last 15 years
 is dauraan bijli kii itani gambhir samasya dekhne ko nahin mili thi
 In such a situation, due to the sudden power crisis in the Congress's Kamal Nath government, the authorities are unable to find out the real reason behind this problem and are trying to avoid giving new arguments
 vahiin, ajtak se baatcheet main purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha, 'pehle congress sarkaar bol rahi thi ki shivaraj singh chouhan ne ghatiya transformar kharide or ab bol rahi he ki chamagadad kii vajah se bijli cat rahi he
 His mental balance has deteriorated
 'aapako bataa den ki aghoshit bijli katautee kamalnath sarkaar ke liye sirdard ban gai he
 The present situation reminds of the era of politics, when the Congress was in 2003 and power became a big issue and the Congress government was overthrown that the Congress could not come to power for 15 years and now the Congress was back in power Electricity problem has arisen as soon as it arrives

 Ministers whose assets have declined where the assets of 24 ministers of the Manmohan Cabinet have increased by more than 100% in two years, there are 15 ministers whose assets have declined

 Exit polls from India Today and Axis My India forecast bjp's clear victory in Gujarat
 bijepi ko 99 se 113 siten mil sakati he, jabaki 22 saal baad vaapasi kii ummiido par congress ko bada jhatka lag saktaa he
 Congress can get 68 to 82 seats only
 congress kii siton main hardik patel ke patidaar andolan sanghathan, jignesh mewaani or bhartiya tribal party bhi shaamil hai
 Others may have one to four seats
 gujarat main bahumat ke liye 92 siton kii zarurat hoti he
 bjp's exit in exit polls makes it clear to you that exit polls are not the result, just a guess
 nattejey 18 disambar ko aaenge
 The exit polls only give some clues about Gujarat's electoral mood
 sateek taur par gujarat ke bare main 18 disambar ko nateezon ko dekhne par hi kaha ja saktaa he
 But according to estimates by india-today and Axis My India from their exit poll, BJP can get 47 percent of the vote in Gujarat
 5 fisadi vot se congress bijepi se pichad sakati he
 The Congress is estimated to get 42 percent of the vote
 anya ke khate main 11 fisadi vot ja sakate hai
 In the 2012 elections, the Congress got 39 per cent votes, which means that it is expected to increase only 3 per cent votes for the Congress
 bijepi ko 2012 main 48 fisadi vot mili the, jisase bijepi ko ek fisadi vot ke nuksaan kaa anumaan he
 In a way, after 22 years of power in Gujarat, the BJP has not let the resentment go against itself and the Congress has failed to bring it in its favor
 eczit pole: bijepi kaa gujarat main sixrrahul kii ranneeti phir fail?sabhi exit pols ke anumaan ye kah rahe hai ki bijepi ko gujarat main haraana mushkil he
 Even though Congress and Rahul Gandhi put their full force
 hardik patel, alpesh thakor or jignesh mewaani jaise yuva netaaon ke sahare gusse ko congress ne apane paksh main karne kii puri koshish kii
 Even though the anti-incumbency atmosphere was being talked about in Gujarat
 lekin kam se kam exit pols ke anumaan se to yahi lag rahaa he ki narendra modi ke naam ke aage aisa lagata he ki gujarat sabko bhul jaataa he
 We will quickly give you an estimate of all exit polls
 darasal gujarat main prachaar ke aakhri 16 din main jis tarah se narendra modi ne bijepi kaa morcha sambhala
 Are the results of the exit polls indicating that the brand Modi in Gujarat has overturned, which Rahul Gandhi was challenging with his aggressive campaign
 lekin gujarat main brands modi ko dharashayi karnaa naammumkin dikh rahaa he
 There was loss
 
 
 magar vipaksh nahin ho sakaa haaavee1
 In saurashtra-kutch area, the BJP did not allow heartburn
 2
 In South Gujarat, the Congress could not support the resentment of the traders
 3
 The Congress is also trying to find caste equations
 4
 Hardik Patel seems to have failed in bringing the Patidars with the Congress on a large scale
 5
 OBC leader Alpesh Thakor, Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani are also seen failing
 6
 Modi's aggressive campaign in the north and central Gujarat region changed the whole picture
 7
 Mani Shankar Aiyar's vile statement made Modi a loser for the Congress
 EXIT POLL: gujarat chunaav main modi magic, tasveeron main dekhen aankademphn modi ne jhonki takatgujrat kisi or ke liye mahatvapurn ho naa ho, congress yaa rahul gandhi ke liye zaruri ho naa ho
 But for Modi Politics, nothing can be more important than this
 ye piem modi ke rajnatik suraksha kavach kii tarah bhi he isliye narendra modi ne aakhir tak puri takat laga di
 From 27 November, PM Modi took over the BJP campaign in Gujarat
 kareeb 34 jagah reliyaan kin, 28 hazaar kilo meter kii duuri tay kii

 Modi often targets his opponents in his speeches, but this time he cares about them with a presentation
 piem ne digital pregentation ke jariye aankade jari kiye or har sector kii growth ko darshaya
 On the allegations of falling GDP, the PM showed a slide, saying, "it is the result of the tireless hard work of the government that today the economy of the country is running with low cash
" Demonetisation ke baad Cash to GDP Ratio ab 9 pratishat par aa gaya he
 Before 8 November 2016 it used to be more than 12 percent ''
 girti growth par kya bole pmpiema modi bole, ''ye baat sahi he ki pichley teen varshon main 7

 a ghastly accident took place on Saturday at Kheraad village on salumbar-jaisamand road in Udaipur district of Rajasthan
 is haadase main 9 logon kii maut ho gai
 According to the information, Praksha Chaudhary, director of Moral Academy School from Salumbar was coming to Udaipur to have a picnic with 5 teachers and 6 children of her school
 is dauraan jaisamand se pehle kherod road gaanv main overtek karne ke prayaas main car road par khadey danpar se jaakar takaraa gai
 The death toll of 9 on the spot was so severe that 9 people on board died on the spot
 mritkon main paanch shikshikaayen or 4 schuli bachche shaamil hai
 As soon as the incident was reported, villagers gathered on the spot and got the injured children admitted to the Community Health Center located in Salumbar for treatment
 is dauraan graminon kii soochna par salumber police bhi maukey par pahunchi or gaadi ko said main karvaa kar raste ko khulwaaya
 After this horrific accident, there was a shout at the spot
 police ne maukey par pahunchakar sabhi mritkon ke shavon ko postmortem ke liye salumber sthit saamudayik swasthya centre par bheja
 The condition of one of the three injured children in the accident is said to be critical
 isko doctoron ne salumber siechasi se behatar ilaaj ke liye udaipur ke maharana bhoopal chikitsaalay main refer kar diya
 On the one hand, the government is arranging the 10th Board as an alternative and continuous holistic assessment to alleviate the stress of examinations from the students, while some schools are taking formative tests of students daily under continuous composite assessment
 kendriya madhyamik shiksha board (sibiesai) ne aise skulon ke pratidin farmative jaanch lene par chintaa vyakt karte hue unhen is tarah bacchon par anaavashyak dabaav banane ke prati chetaya he
 CBSE in its latest circular has instructed schools not to behave in the name of discipline keeping in mind the sensitivity of the students
 sibiesai ke adhyaksh vineet joshi ne kaha ‘‘kisi bhi skool ko anushaasan ke naam par bacchon yaa unke abhibhavakon ke saath rduvyavahaar nahin karnaa chahie kyonki skool vaicharik santhaan hote hai, koi kaarkaana nahin
 "the board has said that in the summative (practical knowledge) test for class 9, children should be asked multiple choice questions
 paripatr main yah bhi kaha gaya he ‘‘skulon ko chaatro kii samvedansheeltaa or unke mastishk main uthne vaale vichaaron ke prati jaagruk hona chahie or yah sunishchit karnaa chahie ki shaareerik, saamaajik or aarthik darje ke aadhaar par unke saath koi bhedbhaav nahin kiya jaae
 According to the board, "continuous Composite Evaluation (CCE) has been introduced in schools as part of the process of reform in education
" yah pichley varsh oktober se amal main aa gaya he lekin aisa paaya gaya he ki kuch skool pratidin ‘farmative jaanch’ le rahe hai
 This is creating unnecessary pressure on the students as they are being told that through it every aspect of them is being assessed
 ’’board ne sweekaar kiya ki iske kaaran chaatro par kaaphi dabaav pad rahaa he
 It is worth mentioning that two forms of Continuous Composite Assessment (CCE) have been prescribed in which the first is formative based on creative knowledge test and the second will be tested through behavioral knowledge (summative)
 rachanaatmak gyaan kii parakh ke liye 40 pratishat ank nirdhaarit kiye gaye hai jabaki vyavhaarik gyaan kii parakh ke liye 60 pratishat ank rakhe gaye hai
 The board has arranged grades in place of marks
 grad ko e 1, e 2, e 3, bi 1, bi 2, si 1, si 2, si 3 or i varg main baanta gaya he
 Under this, the students getting 95 to 100 percent marks are A1 grade, those getting 90 to 94 percent marks are A2, 80 to 89 percent marks are A3, 70 to 79 percent marks are B1, B2 getting 60 to 69 percent marks, C1 getting 50 to 59 percent marks, C2 getting 40 to 49 percent marks, C3 getting 33 to 39 percent marks and scoring less than 32 percent
 Doers Students will be awarded an e grade

 Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma made a similar statement in Rajya Sabha
 mukherjee ne kaha ki sambhddha pakshon main raajnneetik dal or rajyon ke mukhyamantri shaamil honge, jinhen shaamil kiye bina yah faisla lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa

 However, Mamata is asking for a package of Rs 19,000 crore
 haalanki shanivaar ko hi trinmul congress kii adhyaksh mamata banerjee ne elaan kar diya tha ki vitt mantri ne unase epadiai ke faisle par aage nahin badhane kii baat kahi he or sarkaar apane sahyogiyon ko bharose main lekar hi koi faisla legi

 (also from input language) narendra modi or sangh kii baking se manohar laal khattarharyana ke pehle bhaajapai mukhyamantriban gaye hai
 Never before has he been an MLA, nor a minister
 yani shuruaati daur ke modi kii tarah unhen bhi sirf sanghathan chalaane kaa anubhav he, sarkaar chalaane kaa nahin
 In such a situation, these 6 challenges will be in front of Manohar Lal Khattar
 1
 Manohar Lal Khattar belongs to the Punjabi community who migrated from Pakistan
 unhen puure haryana kaa netaa bananaa hoga
 That means Jats, Bishnois, Dalits, Ahirs, Gurjars, Brahmins, Banias, all these castes will have to be brought under their umbrella
 ye kaam khaasaa jaruri he kyonki jati abhi bhi bhartiya loktantr or chunaav kii ek sachai he or sankhya kii drushti se khatter kii jati haryana main nirnaayak to kya prabhavi bhi nahin he
 2
 mukhyamantri pad ke baaki daavedaar ab khatter cabinet main honge
 It includes Rambilas Sharma, Omprakash Dhankhar, Captain Abhimanyu
 congress se aae choudhary birender singh apni patni premalata ke jariye daavedaari thonkenge
 Rao Inderjit Singh, a minister in the Modi government, who has made the BJP a big success in Ahirwal, will also have his eyes fixed
 yahi baat faridabad se saansad or mantri krishnapal gurjar ke bare main bhi kahi ja sakati he
 That is, there will be a circle of protection from all sides
 khatter ko na sirf inhen sadhana hoga, balki ye sunishchit bhi karnaa hoga ki unhen alaakaman kaa lagaataar samarthan miltaa rahe
 Read: 7 similar things in Modi and Khattar 3
 haal tak mukhyamantri rahe bhupinder singh hooda kii sabase badi aalochana bhedbhaav ko lekar hoti rahi he
 Hooda was called the CM of Rohtak, not of Haryana
 aarope tha ki unhen sirf puraane rohtak halake (rohtak, sonipat, jhajjar) main hi vikaas project laane kii dhun he
 In such a situation, whether it is southern Haryana or Sirsa, called Jatland, the area of hisar
 sabhi apni upeksha kaa ronaa rote rahe
 Khattar is born in Rohtak and residing in Panchkula
 or vah ab karnal se vidhayak hai
 In such a situation, there will be no pressure on them to give preference to any particular area
 ab jarurat he un hisson tak vikaas ko le jane kii, jahaan pichley 10 saal main pahiyaa kuch thama he
 It also includes a Muslim dominated area like Mewat, from where not a single BJP MLA came
 4
 a challenge before the Chief Minister of Haryana is the use of land in areas adjacent to Delhi
 hooda apni sielue (change of land yuj) policy ko lekar aalochanaon ke ghere main rahe
 Whether in Gurgaon or Faridabad, Sonipat or Bahadurgarh, land prices are very high in terms of real estate everywhere
 aise main sarkaar ko paardarshee niti apnaani hogi
 After all, Khattar's leader Modi ji has gathered applause and votes by criticizing his son-in-law on the ground
 5
 The image of Haryana is Jat
 aapako sunakar achraj lagegaa magar dur pradesh ke logon ko yahi lagata he ki haryana main sab jat hai, sab kheti karte hai, mastary karte hai or subah shaam doodh pikar dand pelte hai
 The negative discussion of Haryana is sometimes about the decrees of Khap Panchayat, sometimes about the atrocities on Dalits
 khatter ko jaateey, saamaajik santulan saadhane ke saath hi jaateey hinsa ko rokane ke liye prabhavi maikenism apnaani hogi
 Apart from this, there should be no tension due to mutual competition between the deras
 iskaa bhi dhyaan rakhana hoga
 On the one hand, the Jats, the largest population of the state (about 23 per cent), should not feel that if Hooda went, Chautala did not come, then his participation in power ended
 vahiin gairjat jatiyon ko bhi ye laganaa chahie ki ab kam se kam jaateey aadhaar par to unke saath sarkari tantra main bhedbhaav nahin ho rahaa
 6
 or ek baat
 Regarding the dispute with Punjab
 ab dilli main bijepi kii sarkaar he
 In Punjab, the nda's ally Akali Dal is backed by a bjp-backed government

 Such an opportunity does not come again and again in politics
 or ab bijepi yaa khatter kisi kism kii rajnatik taalamatol bhi nahin kar sakate

 She was 67
 ames ke sutron ne bataaya ki swaraj ko raat 10 bajkar 15 minute par aspataal laayaa gaya or unhen sidhe apatkaaleen ward main le jaaya gaya
 However, his life could not be saved
 sushamaa swaraj ke nidhan ke baad bhaajapa ke tamaam netaaon ne to unhen apane-apane tareeke se yaad hi kiya
 At the same time, the leaders of the opposition also paid tribute to him

 In a letter to Sushma's husband Swaraj Kaushal, Sonia said, "I am shocked and very sad to hear about the sudden demise of your dear wife
" 'sonia ne kaha, ‘sushamaa swaraj (sushma Swaraj)ji ek naiysargik pratibha vaali mahila thim
 He displayed courage, commitment, dedication and merit in whatever position he held
 vah bahut hi milansaar thim or samaaj ke sabhi tabakon ke logon ke saath unka garmjoshi bharaa rukh hota tha

 uttarakhand main chardhaam yatra shuru ho gai he, lekin pradesh ke paryaton or dharm, samskruti mantri satpal maharaj is yatra se duuri banaae hue hai
 Satpal Maharaj's absence at the time of opening of the doors of Baba Kedarnath and Badrinath Dham is clearly indicating his displeasure with the government
 unase jab baba kedarnath ke kapaat khulne par kisi bhi mantri ke naa pahunchane ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone tanj ke andaaj main ye kehane main deree nahin kii ki sabhi vahaan sookshm rup main maujuud the, bhale hi tan kahin or tha magar man vahiin baba kedarnath ke dham main tha
 He said this with a laugh

 The government, which was absent from Baba's dham, did not reach a minister
 It is worth mentioning that this time the doors of Baba Kedarnath Dham were to be opened on April 29, in which the arrival of Prime Minister Narendra Modi was considered to be fixed
 unke saath hi 19 rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ko bhi kapaat khulne ke avasar par pahunchnaa tha lekin antim samay main pradhanmantri ke daure main badlaav hua or phir kedarnath main naa to pradesh ke mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat hi kapaat khulne ke dauraan maujuud the or na hi bhaajapa shasit pradesh kaa koi bhi mukhyamantri
 Not only this, no minister of Uttarakhand government has reached this occasion, so only the Governor of the state
 ke paul va rajya ke purv mukhyamantri ramesh pokharial nishank hi the jo kedarnath ke kapaat khulne jaise shubh muhoort par maujuud the
 However, after being quite gritty, BJP state president Ajay Bhatt and Higher Education Minister Dhan Singh Rawat made their presence felt along with Badrinath MLA during the opening of the doors of Badrinath Dham on April 30

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the PMO were constantly eyeing to fulfill the dream of Kedarpuri, but they did not look satisfied after taking stock of Kedarnath from the video conferencing that took place before the opening of the kapat
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki mukhya sachiv ke offis ke dwaara uplabdh karwaae video main kisi bhi tarah kii na to aawaaj hi thi or na hi puraa video hi tha
 The Prime Minister was dissatisfied after watching the 11-second video with a drone camera
 gauratlab he ki jis speed se kaam karne ke liye nirdesh die gaye the us speed se kaam ho hi nahin paaya or abhi bhi kaam puri tarah se adhuraa he jiskaa khamiyaja yatriyon ko bhugatna pad rahaa he

 Chaturdashi of Shukla Paksha of Bhadrapada month is called Anant Chaturdashi
 is din anant bhagwaan kii puja karke sankaton se raksha karne vaala anantsutra baandha jaataa he
 In this, Hari is worshiped as eternal
 hari anant hai to chaudaa ganthen hari dwaara utpann chaudaa lokon kii dyotak hai
 Lord Shri Krishna says that 'eternal' is a form of his forms and they are periods which are called eternal
 anant vrath chandan, dhoop, pushp, naivedhy ke upachaaron ke saath kiya jaataa he
 It is believed that if this fast is performed for fourteen years, then the fast attains Vishnulok
 kya he prachlit kathajab pandav jue main apana sara raaj-paat harkar van main ksht bhoga rahe the, tab bhagwaan shrikrishna ne unhen anantchaturdashi kaa vrath karne kii salaah di thi
 Dharmaraja Yudhishthira, along with his brothers and Draupadi, performed this fast with full law and wore eternal sutra
 anantchaturdashi-vrath ke prabhaav se pandav sab sankaton se mukt ho gaye
 It is described in the scriptures that Lord Vishnu is worshiped in Anant Chaturdashi
 aisi manyata he ki vishnu kii aradhana se churaasi karod yoniyon se mukti mil jaati he or manushya moksh ko praapt karata he
 The festival of Anant Chaturdashi is considered important and full of wishes for Hindus as well as Jain society
 jain dharm ke dashalakshan parv kaa is din samaapan hota he
 Jain followers take out Shreeji's procession and perform the Jalabhisheka of the Lord
 anant chaturdashi vrath-vidhianant chaturdashi vrath ke liye praat:snaan karke vrath kaa sankalp karen
 Although in the scriptures, there is a law for fasting and worshiping on the banks of a holy river or lake, however, in the event that it is not possible, install the urn on the clean land of the house of worship
 kalash par sheshnag kii shaiyyapar lete bhagwaan vishnu kii murti ko rakhen yaa phir kalash par ashtadal camel ke samaan bane bartan main kush se nirmit anant kii sthapana karen
 In addition to this, 'eternal' with fourteen bales of raw thread made of kunkum, saffron or turmeric is also kept
 unke samaksh chaudaa ganthon se yukt anantsutra yani doraa rakhen
 After this, worship Lord Vishnu with the mantra ‘anantaanayam:’
 pujan kaa baad sutara ko purush apane daahine haath or stri baayen haath main baandh len
 After tying the Anantasutra, give a fresh dish to a Brahmin as a bhog and receive family offerings on your own
 puja ke baad vrath-katha ko padhein yaa sunen
 Anant Chaturdashi Katha 1
 anant chaturdashi katha yah he ki satyayug main sumantunam ke ek muni the
 His daughter Sheela was very gentle
 sumantu muni ne us kanya kaa vivaah kaundinya muni se kiya
 When Kundinya Muni was returning home from her in-laws house with his wife Sheela, some women were seen worshiping the eternal God on the way along the river
 shila ne anant-vrath kaa mahatmaya jaanakar un striyon ke saath anant bhagwaan kaa pujan karke anantsutra baandh liya
 As a result, in a few days his house was full of money
 2
 Another legend is also prevalent on this festival
 ek din kaundinya muni kii drushti apni patni ke baayen haath main bandhe anant sutara par padi, jise dekhakar vah bhramit ho gaye or unhone poocha-kya tumne mujhe vash main karne ke liye yah sutara baandha he? shila ne vinamratapurvak uttar diya-ji nahin, yah anant bhagwaan kaa pavitra sutara he
 But Kaundinya, blinded by the beauty of Aishwarya, also misunderstood the right thing of his wife and broke Anantasutra as a dora of captivating the magic and threw it into the fire
 is jaghanya karm kaa parinaam bhi sheeghra hi saamne aa gaya
 All their property was destroyed
 deen-hin sthiti main jivan-yaapan karne main vivash ho jane par kaundinya rishi ne apane aparaadh kaa praayshchit karne kaa nirnay liya
 He went to the forest to ask forgiveness from the eternal God
 unhen raste main jo miltaa ve usase anantdev kaa pataa poochhate jate the
 Even after searching a lot, when Kaundinyamuni was not interviewed by the eternal God, he became frustrated and gave up his life
 tabhi ek vruddh brahman ne aakar unhen aatmahatya karne se roak diya or ek guphaamen le jaakar chaturbhuj anant dev kaa darshan karaayaa
 The Lord said to the sage - all the contempt you have given to Anantasutra is the result of that
 iske praayshchit hetu tum chaudaa varsh tak nirantar anant-vrath kaa paalan karo
 After the completion of this fast, you will regain your destroyed property and you will be happy and prosperous

 He said that this tradition which has been going on for the last few years, it will be completely finished this time
 is baar satta parivartan kyon nahin ho paaegaa, is sawaal par prakaash jaavdekar ne jawaab dete hue kaha ki 2014 ke baad desh kii raajnneeti badal gai he
 BJP has consistently won elections across the country and the Congress has seen defeat and has been reduced to just 4 states
 jaavdekar ne kaha ki jo garib tabaka congress kaa vot bank samajha jaataa tha, vah ab modi ji ke saath aa gaya he
 With the change in the politics of the country from the success of the Modi government in the center of Vasundhara Raje, Prakash Javadekar also spoke about the functioning of Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje
 unhone bataaya, 'ek rajya main itani yojanaon ko laabhakaari hote maine nahin dekhe
 The public has benefited from the Bhamashah Yojana
 bacchiyon ko aarthik madad di gai he
 The government has made arrangements for education from marriage to marriage
 40 lakh logon ko gas chuulhe mili hai or 13 lakh logon ko piem awaas or 7 lakh logon ko siem awaas mili hai
 While 50 lakh women have got mobiles for 100 rupees
 28 lakh kisaanon kaa 50 hajaar tak kaa karj maaf kiya gaya he
 When Javadekar counted so many works, he was asked why despite doing so much, there is resentment among the public and workers
 is par prakaash jaavdekar ne 2017 ke upi vidhansabha chunaav main sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ke chunavi naare kaa istemaal kiya
 He said that the work that Vasundhara ji has done has not been much publicized, but the work speaks more
 jaavdekar ne kaha ki jin logon ko sarkaar kii yojanaon kaa laabh pahunchaa he, ve khud prachaar kar rahe hai
 Let me tell you that Akhilesh Yadav kept going in public for his work in the entire election, but the results were very disappointing for him

 India's attitude towards not protecting the rights of Madhesi and other communities in the new constitution of Nepal in September last year and economic blockade on the border of Madhesi led to a tussle between the two countries

 The Nepalese Prime Minister took office last October and according to tradition, his first foreign trip was to be to India

 Water is supplied in Singapore by wastewater reuse
 raashtrapati bhawan main padam puraskaar samaaroh main hissaa lene ke baad kejariwal ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki unki sarkaar pehle hi ek team ko jal aapurti model kaa adhyayan karne ke liye singapore bhej chuki he
 He said, 'singapore does not have its own water
 lagbhag 95 fisadi pani baahar se aata he
 To tackle this, Singapore has developed a technique in which the water used is cleaned and then reused
 ' mukhyamantri ne kaha, 'yah kaise kiya jaataa he, ham iskaa adhyayan kar rahe hai
 We have plans to start a pilot project to use that technology in Delhi within a month
 'kejariwal ne kaha, 'filter hone ke baad pani kii gunvattta mineral water jaisi hoti he
 The Chief Minister said that if this technology could work in Delhi, then i think there would be no shortage of water in Delhi
 shahar ke anya masalon kii baat karte hue unhone kaha ki sampatti kar bhi ek mudda he or isapar kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 He said, 'I came to know that only 30-40 per cent of the people collect property tax
 ' unhone kaha ki sarkaar is maamle ko dekhegi
 When asked about other issues in the city including the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), he said, 'the Bharatiya Janata Party should take care of them
 'unhone kaha, 'hamane suna he ki unhen vetan diya ja rahaa he, BJP ko unka dhyaan rakhana chahie

 -input IANS se Salman Khan's film Race-3 has been released
 salmaan ke fain soshal media par ise shandaar rispons bhi de rahe hai
 a lot of mimes were made on the film before its release
 ab spoof video bhi saamne aa rahe hai
 a video titled "chhotu Ki Race-3" is in trending of youtube
 ye video 13 june ko publish kiya gaya tha, jo ek din ke andar kareeb 15 lakh se zyada baar dekha gaya he
 More than 32 thousand people have also liked it
 kya he video main?spoof video main salmaan khan or bobi deol ke shartles seen ke alaava anya tamaam seen hai jinhen salmaan khan kii film res-3 ke trailor se prerit hokar banaaya gaya he
 But it has been tried to make it funnel rather than serious
 spoof video ko JKK Entertainment naam ke utyub channel par aplod kiya gaya he
 It is being shared extensively
 video main helicopter ke pankchar hone or sadak par bacchon kii tarah tair daudane ke seen se andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki ise kis tarah se phani banaaya gaya he
 The video is about 12 minutes 44 seconds
 ek boune kalakaar ne res 3 ke kairactor "sikandar" kaa haasyaaspad kirdaar nibhaayaa he
 Talking about Salman Khan's film Race-3, it has not received such a good response from the critics but the public feedback is quite strong
 film ko bharat se ek din pehle yuai main relies kiya gaya tha or vahaan par ise kaaphi shandaar pratikriya mili he
 Critics who describe the film as mild tend to argue that the story is weak
 dekhnaa yah hoga ki film box offis par kaisaa pradarshan karti he
 Arvind Kejriwal will continue to be the Chief Minister of Delhi
 dilli vidhansabha main aam aadmi party kaa vishwaas prastaav congress vidhayakon kii madad se paas ho gaya
 With this, the speculation and apprehensions being made about the fall of the government came to an end
 70 siton vaali dilli vidhansabha main vishwaas mat ke paksh main 37 vot pade
 Of these 28 mlas are from Aam Aadmi Party, 7 from Congress, one from JDU and one is Independent
 vipakshi bijepi ke 32 vidhayakon ne iskaa samarthan nahin kiya
 What Arvind Kejriwal said: Arvind Kejriwal started his speech by congratulating everyone on the new year
 iske baad unhone sadan ko bharosa dilaayaa ki bhrashtachar ke khilaaf karrwai hogi
 He said that the aim of the Aam Aadmi Party is not just to form the government
 balki janata ke kuch mudde hai jinpar sabko saath aane kii jarurat he
 Giving the definition of common man, Kejriwal said that every honest person of this country is common and every dishonest person is special
 hamaare liye jhuggi main rahane vaale bhi aam hai or greater kailash ke aaleeshaan makaan main rahane vaale shaks bhi aam basharte ki wo eemaandaar ho
 The time has come when the House thinks about what the common man wants
 janata ko badi ummiden hai hamase
 The country's politics has become corrupt
 yah puri tarah se kharaab ho chuki he
 There are many problems related to electricity, water and education and only corrupt politics is responsible for this
 rajanetaaon ne aam aadmi ko sunanaa hi band kar diya tha
 When the people of the country came out on the streets with their demands, the leaders challenged them to contest elections
 par netaa ye bhul gaye the ki aam aadmi hi sabase zyada taqatvar hota he
 Farming is done by the common man, not the leader
 antariksh main aam aadmi jaataa he, netaa nahin to usne chunaav lard kar bhi dikhaa hi diya
 The common man fought the truth and won it
 mujhe vishwaas ho gaya ki jiskaa koi nahin hota uskaa upar vaala hota he
 Then came the issues
 kejariwal ne kaha ki desh se viipi culture khatm karne kii jarurat he
 It is a useless thing that we are leaders so red light should be exempted
 yah band hona chahie
 a strict Lokayukta law is needed
 kanoon itnaa sakht ho ki bhrashtachar karne se pehle koi bhi kaanp jaye
 There is a need to create a citizen charter for this
 har kaam puraa karne ke liye ek tay vakt nirdhaarit ho or jo kaam vakt par puraa nahin kare, use kadi sajaa milani chahie
 The small demands of the people of Delhi are not fulfilled
 hamen purna swaraj laana he
 Such a swaraj in which people decide which jobs are to be done, not the leader and the officer
 bijli, pani or aniyamit coloniyon ke muddon par bhi arvind kejariwal ne sadan main apni baat rakhi
 Kejriwal said that i have ordered the audit of power companies
 jaanch se kam-se-kam ye to pataa chalegaa ki bijli main kitna kharch in companiyon ko aa rahaa tha or ve hamase kitna paisa vasuul rahe the
 Then these houses together decide what the electricity rates will be
 pani bill se janata pareshaan he
 We have tried to relieve them
 kai logon ko pani bhi nahin miltaa
 We will work towards this
 log jhuggiyon main rahete hai hamen unke bare main sochna hoga
 We would like their houses not to be destroyed
 kyonki ek shaks ke liye uskaa ghar sabakuch hota he agar wo bhi chin lenge to badi dikkat aegi
 As far as irregular colonies are concerned, all the parties present in this house want to regularize it
 shiksha ke mudde par kejariwal ne kaha ki dilli main sarkari skulon kii haalat behad hi kharaab he
 The truth is that none of our children study in a government school
 in skulon kii sthiti sudhaarney kii jarurat he
 Apart from this, there is also a need to increase the number of government schools
 nijee skulon kii fees bahut zyada he unpar lagaam lagaana hoga
 On women's safety, Kejriwal said that this is an important issue
 damini cond ke bare main har koi jaanata he paanch maheene ke andar nyaay mil gaya
 But there are other incidents in which the victim has not got justice yet
 mahila suraksha ko lekar vishesh vyavastha kerani hogi
 The court will have to increase the number of cases to be heard
 farst court banane honge taaki unhen nyaay milane main deree na ho
 We did not come here to form a government
 sawaal janata ke muddon kaa he
 Today, the country wants to know who wants to establish true and honest politics in this country
 sawaal yah he ki aam aadmi kii is ladaai main aam aadmi ke saath koun-koun khadaa he
 Manish Sisodia put up a Motion of Confidence and PWD Minister Manish Sisodia moved a motion of confidence in the Assembly
 prastaav pesh karne ke saath unhone sadan main maujuud har vidhayak se apil kii ki dilli kii janata kii seva karne kaa mauka unki party ko diya janaa chahie
 We did not have a majority to form the government but got a moral mandate
 lekin aankada puraa nahin tha
 We went to the public for opinion
 dilli kii janata ne hamen sarkaar banane kaa aadesh diya
 We did not make any agreement to form the government
 kisi se charchaa nahin kii
 Our aim is to promote the politics of simplicity
 hamaara makasad he sakht lokapal kanoon paas karnaa
 i want to say to all the honorable members present in the House that they should be from any party, take a historic decision in favor of the people of Delhi
 dow
 Harshvardhan: Desire wants to know the compulsion of AAP Deshidilli got the most honest party the most votes
 vidambnaa hi he ki jo party sadan main 15 saal se raaj kar rahi thi, vah 8 par simat gai, jis party ko sabase zyada siten milin vah vipaksh main baithi or 28 siton vaali party satta main hai
 When Arvind Kejriwal said that he would not support, nor give support to the Congress and the BJP, the respect for him was strengthened
 ek kadam aage badhkar kisi tivi channel par to unhone kasam vagairah bhi kha lee thi
 Sometimes i think he has an unsubstantial mind, but he maintains his point
 lekin kasam tode jane se bahut sachai ujagar hoti he
 Everyone should accept that the people of Delhi gave a mandate against the corrupt Congress
 unhone kaha tha ki purv mukhyamantri (shila) ko jail main bhejenge or unke or sarkaar ke duusare mantri-adhikariyon ke khilaaf jaanch karavaaenge
 But yesterday i heard that he is saying that Dr
 harshavardhan ke paas koi saboot hai to ve de
 The evidence that i have, he himself has exposed many times
 sara desh jaananaa chahta he ki aam aadmi party kii aisi koun si majaburi he ki unhone congress kaa saath liya
 Recently, you spoke very cleverly
 bahaduree se bhi kin
 You said that you will make Janlokpal
 jabaki aap bhi jaanate hai ki janalokapal centre sarkaar hi bana sakati he
 Then you said that the people of Lokalukta do not understand, so you started calling it Jan Lokpal
 congress kii madad se sting oparation se aam aadmi party batch gai
 Torn off laws in Delhi Metro
 aapke liye special metro train chalin
 Security personnel were deployed for safety
 bada haadasa hone se batch gaya
 God forbid it would happen but it could have caused an accident
 metro main talanaa koi vishesh baat nahin he
 i never called the media people and gave a picture of walking in the metro
 tilak maarg par aapke liye do bade sarkari flats surakshit kar liye gaye hai
 Even before the vote of confidence
 hamen in sab chizon se aapatti nahin he
 In politics, we are also in favor of honesty and simplicity
 lekin uske liye kya vah sab kuch kehane kii jarurat he, jo kaha gaya
 a leader of your party said that those who live in Kashmir should have a plebiscite and if people want Kashmir to be segregated then it should be taxed and if it is merged in Pakistan then it should be done
 (bayaan par tathyaatmak galati par aam aadmi party ke vidhayakon ne virodh jataayaa, spikar ke dakhal se maamla sulata
 Harshavardhan said further)
 aapke netaa ne mohanchand sharma kii shahadat par bhi sawaal uthaa die
 You kept asking, will the BJP not do the coalition now in 2014? Even if you form a government in alliance with the Congress, but if we need to form an alliance of NDA under the leadership of Narendra Modi in 2014, we are not allowed to do that either
 ford foundation se abhi tak 3 lakh 69 hajaar dollar kii madad on record aapaki sanstha 'kabir' (manish sisodiya kaa enjio) ko di gai
 We would like to know its purpose
 centre sarkaar to apni jaanch kar rahi hogi
 But the Delhi government should clear its stand on its behalf
 aapane muft pani kii ghoshnaa to kar di lekin abhi jab pani ke bill aaenge to sabko pataa lag jayega ki kiskaa kitna phayda ho rahaa he
 You are reducing the price of electricity by increasing the subsidy
 aap diiarsi par keemten kam karne kaa dabaav banaate
 But you are pretending to reduce my price by taking my money out of my pocket
 hamane bhi daam ghataane kii baat kahi thi lekin hamaari ek jeb se paisa nikaalkar duusare main daalane kii yojana nahin thi
 We wanted to cite the example of solar energy in Delhi
 sienji ke daam bad gaye or sarkaar ko pataa nahin
 What did you do to reduce CNG price in 6 days? nae saal kii saugat ke rup main alpiji ke daam badha die
 People who support terrorists, you meet such people, because you think that you can get votes by doing so
 manish ji naitik bahumat kii baat kar rahe the
 If you can have the highest number of unethical majority in the field of politics, then it is the combined government of both of you
 aapane bhrashtachar ke saath samjhauta kar liya
 Sometimes we feel that the saliva of people starts dripping due to power
 hamen lagata nahin ki janata or desh ke saath vishwasghaat karne vaali aisi sarkaar kaa ham samarthan nahin kar sakate
 can not do
 arvinder singh lavali: doctor saab! upar vaale ne dard diya he, vahi dawa degaamanish sisodiya jo prastaav lekar aae hai main uske samarthan main apane vidhayakon kii ore se khadaa hua hai
 Got to hear a great speech by Doctor Saheb
 15 saalon main pehali baar
 It may be that our work has been lacking in the last 15 years or we have to compete with people who have a mastery in spreading rumors, but you have remained here only, but have not gone there
 aap sabar rakhie
 Make habit of the pain given by the above
 upar vaale ne dard diya he vahi dawa degaa
 If we were in your place, we would have been groaning in pain
 lekin ab kuch bhi ho jaae aap to idhar hi rahoge
 i want to advise you that the seat of BJP is very bad, the one who sits there is either straight out or sits on Jagdish Mukhi seat
 aapke yahaan to vaise bhi in vatting kaa rivaaj he
 Mr
 Speaker, today i am very happy, people of Bangaru ji and Yeddyurappa's party are talking about corruption today
 kejariwal ji ne dilli sarkaar ke saath emsidi ke bhrashtachar kii baat bhi kii thi
 Why do you forget him dilli main kya sthiti thi 1998 main
 And now look
 main koi credit lene yaa uplabdhiyaan ginane nahin khadaa hua hum
 We accept the decision of the public
 aaj ham logon ne inhen samarthan diya he kyonki ham nahin chaahate ki dilli ko ek or chunaav main dhakela jaae
 Only because democracy is not weak
 hamane in sab baton ke maddenjar yah faisla kiya he
 Kejriwal ji, today i want to tell you this
 aap bhi 48 ghante vaala bayaan de dete ho
 i am promising you on record today that as long as your government continues to work for the public interest, we will support you and will continue to give it for five years if needed
 pani par aapane jo faisla kiya he usase un logon ko phayda nahin hoga jinhen jarurat he
 After your decision, water in Delhi has become expensive rather than cheap
 aapane bijli par sabsidi de di to aap ham se alag kahaan hai
 You also feel that there is no other way
 doctor sahab, aapako bhi bataanaa chahta hum
 You are also misleading
 aap solar energy lagane kii baat kar rahe hai
 After sitting in opposition, now the man who is willing
 kejariwal ji aap kah rahe hai ki bijli ke liye aapako 200 karod kii sabsidi deni padegi
 This will give you a subsidy of 315 crores
 main aapako daawey ke saath kah rahaa hum aapkaa daawa galat he
 That too in just three months
 aage aapako faisla karnaa hoga ki aap apane baaki vaadon ke liye fund kahaan se laaenge

 Our plane reached Colombo with a delay of about one and a half hours
 baahar kaa taapmaana 32 degree bataaya gaya
 Came to Sri Lanka after 5 years
 tab se airport bahut badal gaya he
 The last time in 2010 we did not bring the "carne" of the equipment we brought with us
 customvaalon ne 3 ghante tak hamen airport par roke rakhaa tha
 This time there were custom officers who did not know much about "carne"
 unhen ye tak pataa nahin tha ki register ke koun-se kollam main kya likhnaa he? baharhaal hamen unase nibatane main 45 minute lag gaye
 When we came out, Roy's companion was standing with the plate of our name
 jo bhi cricket cover karne srilanka aata he vah roy ko hi taxi ke liye bulaata he
 Roy has also become a big man
 apni company bana lee he, lekin taxi chalaanaa nahin choda he, haalanki hamaare liye usne samira ko bheja tha
 Sameera had already collected information by visiting my Facebook page
 yahaan tak ki use mere bacchon ke naam bhi pataa tha
 Technology has not left privacy or made us a global citizen, it can be a matter of debate
 lekin airport par hamaara kaam abhi khatm nahin hua tha
 Our equipment takes 8 3G cards for live broadcasts
 alag-alag telecom company ke in sim card ko richarge karana tha
 Now the problem was that there was no SIM card number
 ek-ek kar sim apane mobile main daalaa
 SMS number and balance was found, then we were able to recharge
 dollar bhi exange karne the
 If we calculate, then it is known that the price of Indian hundred rupees here is 200
 in sab main kareeb dhai ghante nikal gaye
 It takes one and a half hours to get from the airport to Colombo, but Sameera said that he will take us from the new highway
 china kii madad se srilanka main kai hive banaae gaye hai
 Now Colombo can be reached from the airport within twenty minutes
 hamane galle jane ke liye sadarn express-ve liya
 It is a great road

 No one breaks this rule even at night

 There too drivers do not break the rules on the expressway
 baharhaal, srilanka main china 2007 se bade paimaane par nivesh kar rahaa he, jo bharat kii pareshaani badha rahaa he
 Apart from the highway, China is developing the Hambantota port
 railway kaa aadhunikeekaran kiya ja rahaa he
 The 'lotus Tower' being built in Colombo is a signature of China's presence in Sri Lanka
 mahinda rajpakshe ke nau saal ke kaarykaal main srilanka or china ke bich nazdikiyaan bahut zyaada badhin

 His half hour came after two hours
 hamane sochaa tha ki kisi dhabas par rokegaa, lekin vah to food court tha
 My coworker is a vegetarian
 uski pareshaani bas shuru hi hone vaali thi
 He took pasta first and later pizza, but did not like the taste
 mere bhi khaane kaa swaad alag tha
 People here can eat rice at all three times
 mal culture dhaba samskruti ko nigalata ja rahaa he
 Where does the food taste in the food court? ham thak kar chur ho chuke the
 Sameera told that we will be in her hotel in just half an hour
 ab ham hive chhod patali sadak par the
 The road runs along the Indian Ocean
 samudr kii vishalata manushya ko uske kad kaa ahsaas karaati he
 There is a strange wrinkle on reaching the sea shore
 aap jameen ke aakhri chor par khadey hote hai
 On your next move, the ground runs out
 samira kaa aadha ghanta dedh ghante baad aayaa
 The name of our hotel in "hikka Dua" was "chhaya Trance"
 bich hotel he
 By the way, all the hotels in Gaul are on the beach
 check in karte-karte 11 baje gaye
 Arriving in the room, it was midnight to check the equipment for the live broadcast
 subah 6 baje uthanaa tha
 Customs held us at the airport for 3 hours
 is baar custom adhikari aise the, jinhe "kaarne" ke bare main zyada jaankaree hi nahin thi
 They did not even know what to write in which column of the register? However, it took us 45 minutes to deal with them
 baahar nikle to hamaare naam kii takhti ke saath roy kaa saathi khadaa tha
 Whoever comes to Sri Lanka to cover cricket, he calls Roy for a taxi
 roy bhi ab bada aadmi ban chukaa he
 Have formed his company, but have not stopped driving a taxi, although he sent Sameera for us
 samira mere fasebuk pej par jaakar pehle se hi jaankariyaan juta chukaa tha
 He even knew the names of my children
 takanic ne privesi nahin chodi he yaa hamen global citigen bana diya he, ye bahes kii baat ho sakati he
 But our work at the airport was not over yet
 live broadcast ke liye hamaare upkaran main 8thri ji card lagate hai
 These SIM cards of different telecom companies had to be recharged
 ab samasya thi ki kisi sim card kaa number nahin tha
 One by one the sim was inserted into his mobile
 esemes kar number or balance pataa kiya phir ham richarge kar paae
 Dollars also had to be exchanged
 hisaab lagaaya to pataa chalaa ki yahaan bhartiya sau rupee kii keemat 200 he
 All this took about two and a half hours
 airport se colombo jane main deb ghanta lagata he, lekin samira ne bataaya ki vah hamen nae hive se le jayega
 Many highways have been built in Sri Lanka with the help of China
 ab bees minute main hi airport se colombo pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 We took the Southern express-way to Gaul
 bahut hi shandaar sadak he
 The right lane on the highway here is for overtaking
 raat main bhi koi is niyam ko nahin todta
 Even i saw this in Pakistan
 vahaan bhi driver express-ve par niyam nahin todate
 However, China has been investing heavily in Sri Lanka since 2007, adding to India's woes
 hive ke alaava hambantota bandargah ko china viksit kar rahaa he

 During the nine-year tenure of Mahinda Rajapaksa, closeness between Sri Lanka and China increased greatly
 tippaniyan In the midst of all these thoughts, our car was being run over the road made by China with Ferrate
 bhukh badhati ja rahi thi
 Sameera had told that after half an hour there is a good place to eat on the way
 uskaa aadha ghanta do ghante baad aayaa
 We thought that someone would stop at the dhaba, but it was a food court
 meraa sahakarmi shaakaahaari he
 His trouble was just about to begin
 usne pehle pasta or baad main pizza liya, lekin swaad pasand nahin aayaa
 i also had a different taste of food

 Mall culture is swallowing up Dhaba culture
 dhabas kaa swaad bhala food court ke khaane main kahaan
 We were exhausted
 samira ne bataaya ki ham bas aadhe ghante main apane hotel main honge
 Now we were on the thin road leaving the highway

 visphotak kris gail ne balle se aatish ugala, to sunil narayan ne phiraki kaa jaadu chalaakar ballebaajon kii dhajjiyaan udayi
 The West Indies team may be struggling in the Test series in England, but many of its players have proved to be a troubleshooter in the Indian Premier League teams
 kris gail, sunil narayan, dwen braavo, dwen smith or kevon kupar jaise carabian khilaadiyon ne ipel main apana jalawaa bikherne main koi kasar nahin chodi
 These cricketers helped their teams win many matches, but it is surprising that none of them have found a place in the West Indies team
 westeindies kii team ne jab lords main england se pehla test match paanch wicket se ganvaaya, tab bhartiya sarajameen par cricket premiyon kii jubaan par gail, sunil narayan or braavo jaise carabian cricketron ke naamon kii charchaa thi
 Gayle has not played international cricket since the World Cup last year due to a dispute with his cricket board
 is bich haalanki gail ne twanti-20 main apana khub jalawaa dikhaaya
 He is set to get an orange cap to score the most runs for the second consecutive year in the IPL
 gail kii team royal chalangers bangalore bhale hi ipel se baahar ho gai ho, lekin baayen haath ke is ballebaaj ke 733 ran kii sankhya tak pahunchnaa kisi anya ballebaaj ke boote main nahin lag rahaa he
 Gayle scored 61 in this IPL
 08 kii ausat se ran banaae tathaa record 59 chakke lagaae
 Cricket lovers of the world want to see him in the West Indies team
 vah sambhavat: vanade ke liye rashtriya team main vaapasi karen, lekin test maichon main do tihare shatak jadne vaale gail kii kami team ko test shrunkhlaa main khal rahi he
 If KKR has reached the final, Narayan has played an important role in it
 unhone ab tak 14 match main 11
 Has taken five wickets at an average of 95
 yahi nahin unhone ab tak prati over keval 5
 Has given 29 runs, which can be considered the best figure in T20

 00 kii ausat se 14 wicket lekar unhone acha pradarshan kiya
 Not only this, 11 in six first-class matches
 88 kii ausat se 34 wicket ke pradarshan se pataa chalata he ki narayan lambii avadhi ke maichon main bhi safal ho sakate hai
 Dwayne Bravo, like Gayle, has not played Test matches since December 2010
 lekin chennai ke liye unka westeindies team se baahar rahanaa vardaan sabit ho rahaa he
 Bravo has impressed with his tremendous hitting and economical bowling in the death overs
 is olerounder ne ab tak chennai kii taraf se sabhi 17 match khele hai, jinamein unhone 338 ran banaae or 13 wicket liye hai
 The way Bravo pitched a blistering batting and lively bowling match against the Mumbai Indians on Wednesday in the Eliminator match will probably open the eyes of the Caribbean selectors
 smith ko shuruaati maichon main nahin utaarna shaayad mumbai kii bhul thi, kyonki baad main unhone sachin tendulkar ke saath acchhee salaami jodi bana lee thi
 Smith, who scored 157 runs in seven matches in the IPL, has not been able to play Tests for the last six years and odis for the last two years
 tippaniyan Pollard was able to show his power in a few matches
 unhone 14 match main 220 ran banaae or unke balle se keval 14 chakke nikle
 He tried to make up for it in bowling
 pollard ne 21
 Took 16 wickets at an average of 87
 rajasthan royles ke shuruaati maichon main kevon kupar ne bahut acha khel dikhaaya
 Cooper scored 90 runs and took 10 wickets in six matches before being injured
 unke pradarshan se royles ke captain rahul dravid behad prabhavit the
 He had said that the stakes played by his franchise were correct
 kupar ne abhi tak antarrashtriya match nahin khele hai
 Andre Russell played only three matches for Delhi Daredevils but he thrilled the audience with his power hitting
 malaren sampuls ne bhi rashtriya team main judane se pehle kuch maichon main acha khel dikhaaya tha
 After this, he played an excellent innings in the first Test match against England

 While A
 Raja says that the decisions taken for the benefit of the people gave crores of Indians an opportunity to connect with each other, the National Auditor had said in 2010 that the government treasury in the 2-G scam was 1
 76 lakh karod rupee kaa nuksaan hua
 
 
 The name was given to the scam due to the case of second generation (2-G) allocation of airwaves (or say spectrum)
 
 
 yah spectrum un sabhi companiyon ko muft main de diya gaya, jinke paas bazaar se bhi kam keemat par hasil kiye gaye mobile network license maujuud the
 
 
 The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG or CAG) said that the spectrum should have been auctioned, and a Raja issued 'out of turn' licenses to the telecom companies who had bribed them

 He still has time, but in the last 5 years, Prabhas has continued to be a part of the big project, if noticed
 iske chalate unhone filmein bhi kam hi kii hai or saath main ve lagaataar ection filmein hi kar rahe hai
 However, the thing in favor of the superstar is that his acting is also being liked a lot
 khud kya he prabhas kaa kahana-ek puraane intervyuu main prabhas is baat kaa zikr kar bhi chuke hai
 He had said that he himself wanted to do different types of films
 bahubali ke baad se logon ke man main unako lekar ummiden kaaphi bad gai he
 In such a situation, they now also have a big responsibility to live up to the expectations of the people
 saath hi bade project main kaam karnaa unka confort jone ban gaya he jisase ve baahar nikalnaa chaahate hai

 2014 main is seat se chunaav ladane vaaleen smriti irani ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko kadi takkar di thi
 Even after losing in the 2014 elections, she remains connected with the people of the region and continues to visit here
 jis tarah se smriti irani ne yahaan par logon ke bich apni pahchaan banaai hui he usase yahi kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki wo ek baar phir yahaan se chunaav lard sakati hai
 In such a situation, the election of 2019 will not be easy for the Congress President

 PM Modi said at his rally in Amethi today that even though he did not win the election in 2014, we won the heart here
 smriti irani bhale hi yahaan se chunaav haar gai thim, lekin uske baad bhi modi sarkaar kaa focus is seat par rahaa
 To do development work in the stronghold of Gandhi family is to do the people here in their court
 haalanki ye kaary vot main kitne tabdeel honge ye to chunaav nattejey hi bataaenge

 Within 5 years, the deal was sealed and in a few months the first Rafale aircraft to fly the enemy's senses will be in the skies of India
 piem modi ne kaha ki rafel kii pehali udaan hamaari sarkaar main hogi
 Please tell that the first delivery of Rafael will be in the month of September
 piem modi ne kaha ki hamaare desh ko aadhunik rifl hi nahin, aadhunik bulatopruf jacket hi nahin, aadhunik top ke liye bhi inhen logon ne intjaar karaayaa he
 It is our government that made the deal of modern howitzer and now it is being made in India itself
 pehle jo sarkaar thi, usne surakshabalon kii suraksha main khilwaad karne main koi kor kasar nahin chodi thi
 But far from the start of work, in three years the earlier government could not decide what kind of weapons to make in Amethi's Ordinance Factory
 itnaa hi nahin ye factory banegi kahaan, iske liye zamin tak uplabdh nahin karai gai
 PM Modi said that our soldiers are definitely going to gain a lot in encounters with terrorists and Naxalites from AK-203 rifles
 unhone kaha ki yahaan banane vaali rifl maid in amethi ke naam se jaani jaaegi
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi Chowkidar continues to target PM Modi by raising slogans

 The building was not even built
 2010 main kaam shuru ho janaa chahie tha, lekin uski imaarat 2013 tak lataki rahi

 chandigarh main iees kii beti varnika kundu ke saath chhedchhad kaa maamla soshal media par trend kar rahaa he
 Varnika is being posted on Facebook and Twitter in the name of Lioness of Chandigarh
 vahiin vikaas baraala bijepi netaaon va bijepi ke pradeshdhyaksh subhash baraala par jabardast tareeke se caments kiye ja rahe hai
 Haryana BJP President Subhash Barla's son chased 29-year-old DJ Varnika Kundu on the streets of Chandigarh and was kidnapped
 lekin ek apmanjanak bayaan par subhash barla ke bete ne sawaal uthaaya ki ki vah der raat kyon thim?haryana bhaajapa ke upaadhyaksh ramvir bhatti ne tippanee karte hue kaha ki vah der raat tak ghar se baahar kyon thim mata-pita ko apane bacchon ko der raat tak baahar rahane kii ijaajat nahin deni chahie
 What does it mean to roam around at night? In a channel interview, Miss Kundu gave a strong answer to this saying that it should not mean that i am going where i am going, it means only me and me Is from family aapako bas itnaa hi jaananaa kaaphi he ki agar main baahar ja raheen hum to main surakshit nahi hum chaahe wo raat ke12 baj rahen hon yaa 4 baje hon
 29-year-old Varnika further said that if i am going out like this at night, then it is my fault? Should men not control themselves? varnika ne apane fasebuk acanut par jab is baat ko share kiya to soshal media par ye teji se viral ho gaya unhone bataaya ki kaise shuukravaar kii bich raat ko23 varshiya vikaas barlaor uske doston ne unka kidanap karke apni esayuvi car main band karne kii koshish kii
 But Varnika hit the car window and tried to open the car gate
 police patrol team ne uske esoes kaa diya or uski lokation par pahunche ek aadmi ne kundu ko khidki peetate hue bhi dekha tha
 As a witness, Thabjp has denied the resignation of Chairman Barla, which according to critics has strengthened speculation about the cover-up efforts
 police ne do logon ko giraftaar kar liya he lekin un par chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he
 Not charged with kidnapping
 Tell you this is a non-bailable charge
 phir bhi aaropee giraftaar ke kuch ghanto baad police hiraasat se baahar the
 Although Varnika complained about the man's intention to kidnap, the police have only charged her with a fraud that is grossly false
 jahaan se use kidanap kiya gaya tha un sadako par se sisitivi camera hi gaayab hai ye cover-ap par ek bahut bada sawaal uthaate hue kaha
 This has been a very well done strategy
 jisase mujhe daraaya ja sake ki wo waapas aa gaya he
 But what if those people had caught me? In the last two days, Kundu has been the target of criticism, slander and contempt after the arrests of both of them admitted their mistake but was it really a mistake for so long
 itani teevr nahi ho sakati koi galati ek galati kilometre tak lekar nahin ja sakati
 Those people are apologizing, because i have saved myself
 He asked if i could not save myself, whom did he have to apologize to? There is no difference in killing as
 agar koi bhi desh ek samaan naagarik kii tarah mahila ko nahin samaj nahi saktaa he, to kis tarah ke samaaj main ham rah rahen hai? kya ham asabhy hai?kundu ne bhi ramvir bhatti kii tippanee par coment karte hue kaha unhen baat karne kaa salika nahi he, ve hajaaron saal pehle ke ek pragaitihaasik jaanavar hai
