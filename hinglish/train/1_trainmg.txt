 In such a situation, Sahasarakaryavah Dattatreya Hosbole can be chosen as the next Sarkaryavah of the Sangh

 The effort will be to clean the series by winning both the matches
 team india is series ko lekar zyaada fikramand nahin dikh rahi, lekin zimbabwe ke saamne kuch alag kar dikhaane kaa sawaal jarur he
 However, India has never lost to Zimbabwe in T20 cricket
 series main har khilaadi ne mauqe kaa puraa faaydaa uthaaya he
 Manish Pandey got the chance after Man of the Series Ambati Rayudu got injured, so he did not disappoint by scoring 71 runs
 aakhri match main kedaar jadhav ne shatak thokkar apni daavedaari ko or pukhta kiya he
 Kedar Jadhav said after the whitewash, 'we never thought we would win 3-0
 hamen anumaan tha ki zimbabwe ko unki jameen par haraana aasaan nahin hoga
 It was challenging
 khaskar teenon match main pehle ballebaazi karnaa, lekin ballebaazon ne 250 plus score kar acha kaam kiya
 That is why we won
 ' The team will have to be more aggressive in T20

 The initiative of declaring jaish-e-mohammed leader Masood Azhar as a global terrorist has started again
 khabar he ki is maamle main america, france or britain ne china se baat kii he
 In this negotiation, the three member countries of the Security Council tried to compromise China against Masood Azhar
 mana ja rahaa he ki yah baatcheet acchhee rahi or jald hi is maamle main nayaa mode aa saktaa he
 According to people familiar with the matter, if Azhar is not declared a global terrorist despite this effort, the three permanent members are planning to present a proposal for open debate on the issue to the most powerful wing of the United Nations
 bataa den, china ne ajahar ko vaishvik aatanki ghoshit kiye jane ke prastaav par vito laga diya tha
 This proposal was introduced by America, France and Britain
 bharat ne china ke is rukh ke prati niraashaa jataai thi
 The United States warned that if China does not support us, we will adopt other methods
 haalanki suraksha parishad samiti kii aantarik vaartaayen gopneey rakhi jaati hai, lekin is baar aatankwaadi ko bachaane ke china ke anuchit drushtikon se hataash parishad ke kai sadasyon ne apni pahchaan gopneey rakhte hue media ko bataaya ki china kis prakaar nakaaratmak bhoomika nibhaa rahaa he
 It is believed that the original sponsors of the proposal have been in "goodwill" talks with China for the last 50 hours, which many people have known as "compromises"
 iskaa matlab he ki ajahar ko sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad samiti main vaishvik aatankwaadi to ghoshit kiya jayega, lekin use aatankwaadi ghoshit karte samay istemaal kii jane vaali bhashaa aisi hogi, jo china ke liye sweekaarya ho
 China is believed to have suggested "some changes" in the language of Azhar being declared a terrorist and the US, Britain and France are considering these suggestions
 teenon deshon ne sanket diya he ki yadi prastaav kaa mul bhav nahin badalata or antat: ajahar ko vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit kiya jaataa he to ve bhashaa main badlaav karne ke china ke anurodh ko maanane ke icchhuk hai
 But unlike the past, the US, France, Britain and other members of the Security Council are unwilling to wait too long until negotiations with China conclude
 aisa samajha jaataa he ki china ko in deshon ne suchit kiya he ki ve anya vikalpon par gambhirtha se vichaar kar rahe hai
 They are particularly considering an open debate, after which the motion will be voted on
 beijing ko suchit kiya gaya he ki yah kuch maheenon, kuch saptaah main nahin, balki kuch dinon main hoga
 Also, officials of these countries believe that China is cooperating more this time than before
 is prastaav par china kaa sahyog milane ko badi safalataa mana jayega
 Interaction between China, America, Britain and France is considered a positive sign

 sarkari tel companiyon ke takreeban 55 hajaar adhikari vetan main badhottaree or antarim raahat kii maang ko lekar hadtaal par chale gaye hai
 This is expected to disrupt the supply of petrol and cooking gas across the country
 lekin adhikari ise apni majaburi bataakar hadtaal kaa dosha sarkaar par madh rahe hai
 It is difficult to decide how much effect the strike will have on the common people, but the government has assured complete alternative arrangements

 Meanwhile, the government has said that it is ready to renegotiate the strike
 desh kii aarthik sehat ke liye yah jaruri bhi he, kyonki ek anumaan ke mutabik hadtaal se tel companiyon ko rojaanaa kareeb saadhe chaar arab kaa ghaataa hoga
 On the other hand, the transporters' strike also continues
 transportron ne saaf kah diya he ki sarkaar jab tak raahat nahin detii, tab tak ghate main trakon ko daudana mushkil he
 The aimtc's courage is also strong that the North India Tanker Honors Association has also announced to join the strike

 Although the strike of the trucks does not seem to have much impact in the market, the supply of goods has started to decline in Delhi's biggest market, Azadpur
 trakon ko phir se sadakon par laane ke liye sarkaar esma laane kii dhamkee de rahi he, lekin transporter tus se mas nahin ho rahe
 If the strike continues, the transport industry will have to bear a loss of at least 50,000 crore

 commercial land yuj (CLU) kaa gurugram main sabase bada khel he
 Most of the land in Gurugram is cultivable, but almost every government has made R-zone and commercial zone somewhere for its own benefit
 pehle real estate agent kisaanon kii lakh rupee kii jameen kharid lete hai phir sarkari adhikariyon kii mileebhagat se uskaa CLU karke karodon main bech dete hai
 The latest case also mentions that the robert-dlf land deal was not possible without collusion between administrative officials and effective builders
 isamen bade afasaron dwaara netaaon evam mantriyon ke saath milakar kuch khaas logon ko avaidh phayda pahunchaaya gaya
 According to the lawsuit filed against the land user Robert Vadra, such a change took place 7 to Skylight Hospitality, a company of Omkareshwar Property Nerbertwar, without money
 5 karod main jameen bechi thi
 The check that showed the payment did not reach the account
 ab skylite hospitality ko isliye diya gaya taaki skylite hospitality ke nirdeshak robert wadra omkareshwar property ko usee gaanv main houseing license dilwane main us samay ke toun and country planning ministar par apana nijee prabhaav daal kar madad kar saken
 Robert Vadra is the son-in-law of Sonia Gandhi and Bhupendra Hooda is also the Chief Minister of the Congress government hence Vadra had a personal influence on Bhupendra Hooda and Hooda was the Town and Planning Minister of Haryana
 skylite hospitality privet limited ne is jameen par hooda se commercial colony develop karne kaa license liya or iske baad yahi jameen skylite hospitality privet limited ne ek or company DLF ko 58 karod par bechaa
 DLF itself is the largest real estate company in Haryana and is capable of obtaining licenses
 parantu jaise hi usne yah jameen 58 karod rupee main kharidi, jiske baad wazirabad gurugram main sabhi niyamon ko taak par rakhkar lagbhag 350 acre jameen galat alot kar di gai
 DLF benefited from this by about 5000 crores
 is tarah se puraa maamla quid pro kyuu (quid pro que) hua
 The Supreme Court has prohibited any construction on 350 acres of DLF, as it is the land of the forest department in the papers
 wazirabad main 2011 main artiai main pataa laga ki ye gram panchayat kii jameen thi jo HSIDC ne ekwaire kii thi
 The then Chief Minister Chautala's government wanted to build a laser club and park on it
 unki sarkaar ke jane par jab bhupendra singh hooda mukhyamantri bane to unhone privet builder ke liye rasta khol diya
 At that time the only builder was DLF
 dobaaraa jab ribiding hui tab 1700 karod main 350 acre jameen di
 This land was on forest
 artiai activist harinder dhigara ne kaha, 'darasal yah jameen punjab land and forest act (PLFA act) ke tahat aati he
 Construction cannot take place without the permission of the Ministry of Environment and Forests
 quid pro kyuu (quid pro que) kaa arth hota he badale main yaa phir muaavja
 The same word is used in the complaint lodged against Robert Vadra
 mukademen main saaf taur par shikayatakarta ne aarope lagaaya ki 3 acre kii jameen ko lekar DLF ko bechnaa or robert wadra ko 50 karod kaa phayda dena ek fevar kii tarah he
 It is like a chawl in which 300 acres of land was bought at a price of a penny

 In the masterplan in Gurugram, it is only seen that where is the r zone and where is the commercial zone? Farmers are deceived and taken care of by their own
 masterplan ke naam par lakhon kii kisaanon kii jameen arabon kii ho jaati he
 They buy agricultural land from their men and then bring its masterplan

 His debut speech saw 5 major moments
 viraasat ke gaddimit shah ne kaha ki 2014 main jab ham satta main aae to hamen viraasat main gadhde mili the
 a lot of the government's time was spent filling the pit
 unhone kaha ki 2013 main desh kii jo sthiti thi, use yaad karne kii jarurat he
 The pace of development had fallen in the country, women were not safe in the country
 seemaa kii raksha karne vaale jawan sarkaar ke anirnay ke kaaran kuch kar nahin paa rahe the
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has brought the country out of such times
 galati ke tokane par kiya sudharshah ne pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara gas sabsidi chhodane kii tulana purv pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri ke dwaara desh ko ek din ke upwas karne ke elaan se kiya
 Shah said that people are reluctant to take decisions in the interest of the country for the sake of vote politics
 unhone kaha ki purv ke pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri ne pakistan ke yuddh ke samay chaaval kii kami ho gai thi
 In this way, he had asked the people of the country to fast for one day in a week
 shah ne somvaar ke din kaa zikr kiya, lekin bagal kii ore se ek rajyasabha sadsy ne tokaa ki somvaar nahin balki shanivaar kaa din kaa baat shastri ne kahi thi
 At this, Shah corrected his mistake and said that i was not born at that time
 unhone kaha ki piem kii apil par desh ke 1 karod tees lakh logon ne sabsidi chhod di
 The Prime Minister has launched the Ujjwala scheme for the poor, dalits and tribals with the abandoned gas subsidy
 koi or piem hota to apana khajaana bhar letaa
 Pakoda Employment Amit Shah also reiterated the talk of Pakoda employment like Prime Minister Narendra Modi

 Shah said that the tea seller is the Prime Minister of the country today
 aaj jo pakora bechra he wo kal kaa udyogpit ban saktaa he
 Amit Shah praised Indira Gandhi in her speech
 unhone kaha indira ji ne bainkon kaa rashtriyakaran karne kaa bada kadam uthaaya
 Despite this, the doors of banks were not opened for the poor
 hamaari sarkaar ne jandhan yojana ke tahat garibon ke liye bainkon main khate khulwaane kaa kaam kiya
 Gabbar Singh Taxshah said, 'many ministers of Congress governments attended the 23 GST Council meeting and agreed
 lekin sadan main kuch or bhashaa bolte hai
 People are calling GST a Gabbar Singh tax, Gabbar Singh was a dacoit
 kanoonee rup se tex lenaa kya dakaiti he? ye tex javaanon ke liye jaataa he, logon kii bhalaai main jaataa he
 Is it a good thing to ask people not to pay tax? ' Most trends of Lok Sabha elections have come
 centre main ek baar phir bijepi (BJP) ke sir sehara bandhane ja rahaa he
 In this wave of PM Narendra Modi, the Congress has also lost its traditional stronghold Amethi

 Smriti Irani has tweeted and wrote: 'who says there is no hole in the sky? 
 
 'koun kahata he aasmaan main suraakh nahin ho saktaa 
 
 
 Reactions are also coming from Bollywood for this victory of Smriti Irani
 bollywood actor vivek oberoi (vivek Oberoi) ne bhi smriti irani ko badhai di he
 He said, 'ultimately the people of Amethi have put an end to dynastic politics, now justice will be done to the people of Amethi
 ' vivek oberoi ne smriti irani (smriti Irani) ko shubhakamanaayen dete hue kaha, 'smriti irani ji ko is ullekhneey faisle par bahut-bahut shubhakamanaayen
 He tried hard to discredit you, but you stood in front of him like Durga
 ham sabko aap par bahut garv he
 Smriti Irani contested against Rahul Gandhi in 2014 from Amethi

 But this time Smriti Irani has defeated Rahul Gandhi here and destroyed the old Congress stronghold

 There are reports that elections will be held in Bihar in October and November, which can be held in several stages
 29 november ko bihar vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal khatm ho rahaa he
 The comments isse pehle 2010 main 6 charnon main bihar chunaav karaae gaye the
 There are 243 assembly seats in Bihar
 jediu, argedy or congress saath milakar mahagathbandhan ke binar tale chunaav maidan main hai to duusari taraf bijepi ke netritv main endie ke dal shaamil hai
 Not only this, the Election Commission has prepared a program keeping Diwali and Chhath in mind
 khabaren hai ki bihar main oktober or november main chunaav honge, jinhen kai charnon main karaayaa ja saktaa he
 The term of the Bihar Legislative Assembly is ending on 29 November
 tippaniyan Earlier in 2010, Bihar elections were held in 6 phases
 bihar main vidhansabha kii 243 siten hai
 JDU, RJD and Congress are together in the election field under the banner of the grand alliance and on the other side the NDA parties led by BJP are included
 yahi nahin chunaav ayog ne diwaali or chhath ko dhyaan main rakhkar kaarykram banaaya he

 india today conklev east 2019 kaa kolkata main aagaajavirodh ke khilaaf cedishan cese ke istemaal par hui charchindia today group ke lokapriy or charchit kaarykram 'india today conklev east 2019' kaa aagaaj ho gaya he
 BJP leader and fashion designer Agnimitra Paul at the 'flashpoint: Treason: New Test Kit of Patriotism' session on the first day of the conclave, former Supreme Court judge Dr
 ashok ganguli, bijepi (pashchim bengal) ke mahasachiv sayanthan basu or mental health activist ratnaboli raay ne apane vichaar rakhe
 In this important session, the stage was conducted by Rajdeep Sardesai, consulting editor of India Today Television
 bijepi mahasachiv ne uthaai priyanka sharma ke jail jane kii batsedishan par charchaa ke dauraan bijepi netaa sayanthan basu ne kaha ki meri party is tarah kii vendata se kaam nahin karti
 In the case of Jharkhand and Bihar, our party did not talk to anyone
 main aapako apane rajya ke 100 se zyada udhaaharan de saktaa hum
 Justice Ganguly is here
 unhone agar rajya sarkaar ke khilaaf kuch bolaa to unke khilaaf cese laga diya jaataa he
 Think about what can happen against a common BJP worker when this can happen to a former Supreme Court Justice
 ek ladki ne ek photo watsape par forward kii, vah photo priyanka chopra se milti thi or use 10 dinon tak jail kii salaakhon ke peeche rakhaa gaya
 Sayantan Basu said that if Ratnaboli has the right to write a letter to the PM, then he also has the right to write a letter to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee
 is par jab ratnaboli se poocha gaya ki kya agar aap mukhyamantri ko chitthee likhengi to aapako yahaan bhi rajdroh kaa saamana karnaa padegaa to unhone kaha ki mujhe aisa nahin lagata
 We need to address the issue
 sayanthan basu ne bhi palatwaar karte hue kaha ki jharkhand main hui us ghatana ko pradhanmantri ne bhartsana kii thi
 He said that this should not happen
 
 
 
 During the debate, former Supreme Court Justice Ashok Ganguly said that the Sedition Act was removed in any civilized Democratic Nation
 har jagah yah cognijible afence (sangyeya aparaadh) nahin he
 In Britain it has been removed, in the US it is not a cognizable crime
 lekin yahaan yah cognijible afence he
 Kanhaiya Kumar should not have been arrested without a warrant
 is baat par sayanthan basu ne kaha ki mujhe lagata he ki agar koi chitthee likhata he to vah cedishan main nahin aata lekin agar koi yah kahata he ki bharat tere tukade honge to vah cedishan main aata he
 Further in the discussion, activist Ratnaboli Rai said that many big names wrote letters but questions were raised, which they do not like is not right
 bijepi netaa agnimitra paul ne ratnaboli ko tokate hue kaha ki aapako rajya kii ghatnaayen kyon nahin dikhti, aap rajya ke muddon par aawaaj kyon nahin uthaati
 Justice Ashok Ganguly further said that action should be taken against you in the state
 ratnaboli ne kaha ki mamata banerjee ke ghar ke saamne pradarshan karne vaale kuch logon ko uthaaya gaya to ham gaye or baat kii or kaha ki yahaan doylog kii jagah honi chahie lekin hamaari chitthee ke khilaaf prasoon joshi ne jo chitthee likhi use aap dekh sakate hai
 The BJP leader attacked the Mamata government and said that what is happening in West Bengal cannot happen in any civil society
 jo log aaj unke saath hai main chalange karata hum ki wo mamata ke khilaaf baat karen unke saath bhi vahi hoga jo dusron ke saath hua
 Mamta Banerjee does not believe in democracy
 pashchim bengal main cedishan ek regular thing he
 Ratnaboli said that the talk of Jai Shri Ram and independence has been there for a long time but my question is why it became an issue today
 is par sayanthan basu ne kaha ki aapako jai shri ram se allergy kyon he
 When the discussion of onion erupted in the middle, Agnimitra said that i am saying that if you are raising voice then raise your voice against everything
 aisa lag rahaa he ki aap mukhyamantri ke khilaaf aawaaj nahin uthaate kyonki aap unase darate hai
 Ratnaboli asked what the onion sentiment was amidst the discussion
 jis par sayanthan basu ne kaha ki mamata ji se pucho naa
 Today (26 March) is the birthday of famous South actor actor Prakash Raj
 ye vahi actor hai jinhone bebaak andaaj main modi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadh kar sabko hairaan kar diya tha
 a case has also been filed against this National Award Winner actor, who calls PM Modi an actor
 prakaash raaj ke bhaashan ke baad BJP ne stage ko gomutra se kiya 'shuddh'!pichley dinon jarnlist gauri lankesh kii hatya ko lekar piem modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue prakaash raaj ne kaha tha ki, log soshal media par khuleam gauri lankesh kii hatya kii khushi manaa rahe hai
 Even those who celebrate happiness are those whom PM Modi follows on social media
 prakaash raaj ne piem modi ko apane se bada actor bhi bataaya tha
 After this statement, the actor also threatened to return his National Award
 conklev south 2018: modi or shah hindu nahin- prakaash rajis bayaan ke alaava india today conklev south 2018 event main bhi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhane ko lekar actor prakaash raaj charchaa main aa gaye the
 The statements about which Prakash Raj was in the headlines were: 1
 'dharm, samskruti or naitikta ke naam par dar paidaa karnaa aatank nahin to kya he?'2
 'I don't want any award
 mujhase na kahen ki achche din aaenge
 i am a well-known actor, i recognize when you are acting
 '3
 'if abusing and assaulting young couples on the streets of my country is not a terror, if taking the law in hand and killing someone in the crowd without suspicion of cow slaughter is not a terror, if trolling with abuses, Threatening, suppressing even the smallest voice of differences is not terror, then what else is terror
 '4
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah are not Hindus
 modi sarkaar kaa koi mantri kisi ek dharm kaa puri tarah se safaya karne kii baat kahata he or pradhanmantri or unki party ke adhyaksh chup rahete hai to unke hindu hone par sawaal uthaane ko kaise galat tehraaya ja saktaa he
 5
 padmavat ke virodh ko lekar kiya tha twit- prakaash raaj ne apane twit main likhaa, 'ek naak kaatna chahta he
 
 ek kalakaar ko peeche karnaa chahta he
 Wants to shoot an actor
 
 
 or ek juri dwaara chune jane ke baavjood film samaaroh se kuch filmon ko hataanaa chahta he
 And you want us to believe that there is no sign of intolerance

Loved my bouquet! a post shared bymadhu Raja (@ madhuraja2011) onmar 12, 2017 at 12:19 am PST tej or swing leti pich par bhartiya ballebaajon ko aasaan shikaar banane ke baad england ne apni pehali pari main acchhee shuruyaat karke tisare test cricket match par pehle din hi majboot pakad bana lee
 See how India collapsed for 224 runs in the first innings of the third Test, with the collapsing bowling of team Indiastuart Broad and Tim Bresnan
 bhartiya score ek samay saat wicket par 111 ran tha lekin dhoni kii 96 gend par das chaukon or teen chhakkon kii madad se kheli gayi 77 ran aatishi pari se vah 200 ran ke paar pahunchane main safal rahaa
 England then scored 84 runs without loss in the remaining 25 overs of the day
 captain andrew straas (naabad 52) or elistare cook (naabad 27) shrinkhalaa main pehali baar farm main dikh rahe hai jisase bharatiyon kii pareshaani bad gayi he
 In the absence of Zaheer Khan, no Indian fast bowler left any significant impact on these two
 england ab bharat se keval 140 ran peeche he or uske sabhi das wicket bache hue hai
 The bowlers were getting a swing from Edgbaston's pitch, but the Indians did not get any benefit from it
 broad or bresanan ne jarur apane captain kaa tas jitkar pehle kshetrarakshan karne ke faisle ko sahi sabit kiya
 Both of them took four wickets while James Anderson took two wickets
 shrinkhalaa main 0-2 se peeche chal rahe bharat ne pehle donon satr main chaar-chaar wicket ganvaaye
 Virender Sehwag (00), who returned after recovering from a shoulder surgery, has his successful opening partner Gautam Gambhir (38), Sachin Tendulkar (1) awaiting his century, and in-form Rahul Dravid (22) in the first season
 The pavilion returned
 bharat ko ummid thi ki sahvaag ke aane se team ko acchhee shuruyaat milegi lekin vah pehali gend par hi pavilion laut gayi
 Short pitch ball coming out of Brad's off stump was caught by wicketkeeper Matt Prior by diving
 ampire ne england kii apil thukraa di lekin diares se saaf ho gaya ki gend praayar ke dastaanon main pahunchane se pehle sahvaag ke dastaanon ko chumkar gayi thi
 Dravid and Gambhir moved the innings smoothly, but Bresnan, who came as the first change, allowed the partnership to run for only 51 runs
 bresanan kii teji se swing leti gend gambhir ke balle kaa bahari kinaaraa lekar viketon main samaa gayi
 Gambhir played 64 balls in his innings and hit five fours
 tendulkar ke aate hi straas ne anderson ko gend saunp di jinhone is ballebaaj ko test maichon main chah baar out kiya he
 Anderson again extended the wait for Tendulkar's 100th international century
 is baar haalanki unki bhoomika badali hui thi
 The bowler was Brad whose swinging bowler, by tampering with the ball, Tendulkar caught Anderson in the slip
 lakshmana phir se achche tach main dikh rahe the
 The Bresnan on which he took an aggressive attitude finally gave the mistake to the same bowler to celebrate
 yah kalatmak ballebaaj lagaataar tisare test match main gend ko pul karne ke prayaas main out hua
 Bresnan's ball took the upper edge of his bat and went into the safe hands of Brad at long leg
 harbhajan singh kii jagah team main liye gayi mishra bhi adhik der tak nahin tik paye
 Dhoni adopted an aggressive attitude in the meantime and in the meantime Anderson, Bresnan and Brad also hit sixes off the ball

 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad agsit pole ke jo aankade aae hai usamen endie gathbandhan ko maharashtra main badi jeet milane ke asaar hai
 Till date, according to exit poll of Axis My India, out of 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra, NDA can win 38 to 42 seats while UPA is expected to get only 6 to 10 seats
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko vahaan 23 siten mili thim jabaki sahyogi shivasena ko 18 siten mili thim
 If this figure turns into a result of the deteriorating relationship between BJP and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra in the last five years, it would be considered a major victory for the Chief Minister of the state Devendra Fadnavis
 maharashtra main saal 2014 main loksabhaa chunaav ke thode dinon baad hi vidhansabha chunaav hue the jisamen bijepi ne 122 jabaki shivasena ne 63 siten jiti thi
 Devendra Fadnavis, who was the state president after winning the election, was made the chief minister of the state by the BJP
 us vakt fadanvis bijepi ke sabase yuva mukhyamantriyon main se ek the
 Fadnavis proved himself, after the 2014 assembly elections, some decisions in BJP and Shiv Sena and differences over domination in Maharashtra started
 kisaanon ke mudde se lekar pani kii samasya tak par sarkaar main sahyogi shivasena ne hi sawaal uthaae or fadanvis ko iske liye jimmedaar bataaya
 In Maharashtra, the impact of a spat between the two parties was seen even in Delhi
 vivaad itnaa bad gaya ki saal 2016 main maharashtra main hue nagar nigam or nagar panchayat ke chunaav main donon partiyon ne chunaav alag-alag ladane kaa elaan kar diya
 While BJP won 1147 seats in this election, Shiv Sena won 608 seats
 khasbaat yah thi ki fadanvis ke netritv main bijepi kaa aadhaar or badha
 In the municipal elections, the BJP repeated its better performance than before
 is parinaam ke baad fadanvis kii chhavi bijepi or maharashtra kii raajnneeti donon jagah majboot ho gai
 However, after this, the attacks of Shiv Sena, which was an ally in the government, increased on them and they were held responsible for every problem in the mouthpiece 'saamana'
 saal 2018 main hue nagar nikaay chunaav main bhi bijepi ne maharashtra main itihaas rachaa or sangli ke 78 siton main se 41 siton par baari maton ke saath jeet darj kii
 After this victory, Fadnavis's image became bigger in the politics of Maharashtra, which made the Shiv Sena uncomfortable
 shivasena pehle naaraaz baad main diya fadanvis kaa saath23 janvari 2018 ko bijepi or shivasena kii kareeb 25 saal puraani dosti tut gai or party adhyaksh uddhav thakare ne 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav akele ladane kaa elaan kar diya
 At that time Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had said in front of the media that i pledge that we will contest elections on our own in all the states of the country, whether we win or lose but we will contest elections on our own
 us vakt shivasena ne yah bhi daawa kiya tha ki wo 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 25 or vidhansabha chunaav main 150 siten jeetegi
 However, after several rounds of manpower before the Lok Sabha elections, Shiv Sena once again contested the Lok Sabha elections with the BJP
 is dauraan sabase khasbaat yah rahi ki endie se khud ko alag karne ke baad bhi shivasena ne kabhi rajya yaa centre main bijepi se samarthan waapas nahin liya
 The Shiv Sena continued to hold the post of quota minister in Maharashtra even after the announcement of fighting alone
 shivasena ko chunaav se thik pehle dobaaraa endie kaa hissaa banane main bhi fadanvis kii ahm bhoomika rahi thi
 Now in the coming time, everyone's eyes will remain on whether the Shiv Sena will contest the assembly elections with BJP or will go the other way if seats are not discussed
 vidhansabha chunaav kii baari or fadanvis kii taiyaariloksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan aaj tak ne jab maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis se baatcheet kii to unhone kaha tha ki beete paanch saalon main unhone maharashtra ke liye jitne kaam kiye wo usase pehle kabhi nahin hue the
 In Maharashtra, on all the issues ranging from drought, water scarcity, farmers' debt, lack of infrastructure in villages, crime, unemployment, we had said that we are constantly doing better work on this and for these works, Lok Sabha elections and then again Will go among the people of Maharashtra in the assembly elections
 loksabhaa chunaav ke khatm hone ke baad ab isi saal ke ant main vahaan vidhansabha chunaav hone kii bhi sambhaavna he
 In such a situation, Fadnavis has the biggest responsibility to bring the BJP back to power and he has already started preparations for this
 booth level se lekar block level tak wo bijepi ko majboot karne main jute gaye hai or lagaataar maharashtra ke duurastha ilaakon kii khaak chaan rahe hai taaki chunaav se pehle hi logon kii jaruraton or naaraazgi kii vajahon ko samaj saken
 In different cases of murder, two prisoners serving life imprisonment in Etawah District Jail of UP escaped with a wall
 unamem se ek kii train se katkar maut ho gayi
 Jail Superintendent Raj Kishore Singh said on Sunday that at about two o'clock on the night of July 6, inmates Ramanand and Chandra Prakash planted a tree and ran away with the help of a sariya and ran away the jail wall
 jail ke peeche kii taraf railway line he
 He said that at about three o'clock in the night, when the deputy jailer Jagdish Prasad came out on a tour of the jail, he came to know that the two prisoners were absconding, after which they started searching for them
 isi bich, railway police ne railway stesan ke paas ek vyakti ke train se katane kii soochna di, jisaki pahchaan faraar hue kaidi ramanand ke rup main hui
 Singh said that it seems that Ramanand has died due to being caught in a hurry while trying to run away from a train
 unhone bataaya ki ramanand hatya ke ek maamle main aaajeevan karawas kii sajaa kaat rahaa tha
 At the same time, Chandra Prakash was the perpetrator of a mass murder in the year 2008 in village Aminabad of Ekdil police station area
 jail adheekshak ne bataaya ki is maamle main jail prashasan se chook, laaparvaahee hui he jisamen doshiyon ke viruddh karrwai kii jaaegi
 The absconding prisoner Chandra Prakash is being searched

 film 'mairi com' main priyanka chopra ke saportive pati onler kaa kirdaar nibhaa chuke darshan kumaar, anoushka sharma ke saath unki agali film‘en ech 10’main ek alag andaaj main najar aane vaale hai
 The interesting thing is that Darshan Kumar, playing the character of Haryanvi Jat Satbir in this film, kept distance from the film's cast during the shoot to play his character in full force
 sutron kii mutabik, film main negative kirdaar nibhaa rahe darshan ne apane kirdaar ko eemaandaaree se nibhaane kaa is kadar pran kar rakhaa tha ki shot ke baad bhi vah usee kirdaar main rahete the
 Not only this, he did not even talk to his co-stars Anushka Sharma and Neil Bhupalam for not having any kind of astonishment in it
 jab is silsile main darshan se baat kii gai to unhone kaha, 'maine nasiruddin shah ke saath theatre kiya he or unhone hi mujhe sikhaaya he ki jahaan tak ho sake har samay apane kirdaar main rahen
 My scenes with Anushka in this film were quite difficult
 jaisaa ki aam jindagi main anoushka kaaphi bubbly or energetic hai to unke saath sahaj hone main mujhe koi mushkil nahin aati lekin isse meri parformons par fark padataa
 This is the reason that i kept distance from Anushka throughout my 60-day shooting schedule

 justise markandeya katjuke angreji blog 'satyam bruyat' par ek post main disclemur he
 In the post written on Mahatma Gandhi, Katju says that whatever he says, he does not say for publicity but in the national interest
 to kya rashtrapita mahatma gandhi or netaji subhash chandra bose par unki tippaniyan vaaki rashtrahit main hai? kam se kam rajya sabha ko to aisa nahin laga
 The condemnation motion passed against Katju in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday is proof of this
 vaise rajya sabha ke ninda prastaav ke baad markandeya katju ke tevar or tej ho gaye hai
 Now Justice Katju says that the mere condemnation motion against him is insufficient and he should be sentenced to death without trial
 katju ne 10 march ko ek twit kiya tha, jisamen unhone kaha, "gandhi angrejon ke agent the, or subhash chandra bose japaniyon ke agent the
 There is not much difference between the two agents
 "supreme court ke purv nyaayadhish katju apane bayanon ko lekar aksar charchaa main rahete hai
 Here are some such statements of Katju which made headlines due to controversies
 rajya sabha main ninda prastaav par"oh! ascharyajanak khabar
 The Rajya Sabha (upper House of the Indian Parliament) has passed a resolution in my condemnation
 lekin nishchit taur par yah paryaapt nahin he
 i must also be punished for what i said about the fake, called Father of the Nation and agent of Japanese fascists
 mahaj ninda dand nahin he

 "katrina ko raashtrapati banaao''main hameshaa se hi chunaav main sundar mahilaon jaise ki filmi abhinetriyon ke chayan kaa samarthan karata hum
 This is because leaders will always talk about getting the moon, but will never work for the public interest
 isliye chunki aapako kisi na kisi kaa chunaav to karnaa hi he, to kyon nahin kam se kam sundar chehre ke liye vot diya jaae
 At least you will have momentary happiness by seeing that beautiful face in the media
 nahin to aapako ant main aise to kuch bhi hasil nahin hone vaala
 My advice is that Katrina Kaif be made the next president, on the condition that she sing the song 'sheela Ki Jawani' on the occasion of her swearing-in
 hari om
 "shazia is better than Kiran" i agree that Shazia Ilmi is more beautiful than Kiran Bedi
 agar shajia ilmi ko bijepi apana siem candidet banaati to nishchit hi party dilli chunaav jeet jaati
 Because people vote on the pretty face more and more, as it did in Croatia
 yahaan tak ki mere jaisaa vyakti jo vot nahin detaa wo bhi shajia ko vot detaa
 "not sent to mind" i can say that ninety percent of Indians are idiots

 They can be easily seduced

 It is about those days when Justice Katju used to be the President of Press Council of India
 katju ne patrakaron par hamalaa roak paane main aksham sabit ho rahi tab kii maharashtra sarkaar ko raashtrapati ke jariye barkhaast karwaane kii chetavanee bhi de daali thi
 In this regard, Katju wrote two letters to the then Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan but did not receive any reply
 phir unhone kaaran bataao notice ke saath teesraa patr bheja
 In the notice, Katju wrote, "since your government seems to be incapable of enforcing the right to freedom of press as given under Section 19 (1) ([A) of the Constitution, then why should we not see the President of India Under Section 356 of the Constitution, recommend the dismissal of your government? ”katju later said that he had not said those things seriously, including his statement about Katrina Kaif
 yani katju ke bayaan ko samajhane ke liye unke agle bayaan kaa intjaar karnaa hoga
 Taking Katju's serious things lightly is a difficult task

 2011 ke pehle rashtriya khate main jis menuphaccharing vailu ko joda jaataa tha, use audyogic utpaadan suchakank (IIP), menuphaccharing niryaat jaise vinirmaan ghatakon se sakhti se jodakar dekha jaataa tha
 But after this the relationship is broken
 subramanyan ne 17 pramukh aarthik sanketakon ke aadhaar par vishleshan kiya he jinka jidipi growth se kaaphi kareebi rishta hota he
 But this does not include the disputed MCA-21 data base, which is an integrated part of the cso's estimate
 jidipi aankadon ko lekar rahaa he vivadgauratlab he ki beete kai maheenon se bharat ke jidipi aankadon ko lekar sawaal khadey kiye ja rahe hai
 Recently, former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan raised doubts about GDP figures
 iske baad khud neshnal sample survey offis (NSSO) ne in aankadon par sawaal khadey kiye
 According to the Mint report NSSO has made a study from July 2016 to June 2017
 is study main paaya gaya ki ministry of corporate afares ke MCA-21 database kii 36 fisadi companiyon kaa koi ata-pataa nahin he
 Explain here that the companies in MCA-21 database are those which are used to calculate GDP
 report main daawa kiya gaya tha ki company maamalon ke mantralay ne in gumnaam companiyon ko ‘sakriy company’ kii shrenee main rakhaa tha
 Those companies who have filed returns at least once in the last 3 years are placed in this category
 2015 main shuru hui thi jidipi kii nai serissaal 2015 main narendra modi kii sarkaar ne GDP kaa base year sanshodhit kiya tha
 The base year was increased from 2004–2005 to 2011–2012
 saal 2011-2012 ko aadhaar banaakar GDP ke nae aankade pesh kiye gaye the
 After the revised figures, the growth estimate during the UPA government showed a large decline
 shuruaati aankadon ke mutabik, UPA sarkaar ke dauraan GDP kii growth rate 10
 26 percent
 jabaki nae aankadon ke hisaab se ise sirf 8
 5 percent reported
 raghuram rajan bhi uthaa chuke hai sawalisase pehle bhartiya rigerv bank ke purv governor raghuram rajan ne bharat kii 7 fisadi kii aarthik vikaas dar ke aankade par andeh jataayaa tha
 He insisted on the appointment of an impartial group to remove doubts arising over the gross domestic product (GDP) figures
 haal hi main ek intervyuu main unhone kaha tha ki unhen yah nahin pataa he ki maujuuda sankhyikee aankade kis ore ishaara kar rahe hai
 These need to be corrected to find the true growth rate of the country
 haal hi main dilli ke firozshah kotla stadium main hue test match main smog ke kaaran srilankai khilaadiyon ne mask lagaakar match khelaa
 People gave many kinds of reactions about this
 jahaan kuch logon ne srilankai team kaa majaak banaaya, vahiin kuch logon ne dilli ke vaataavaran ko lekar chintaa jataai
 But the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has written a letter to the BCCI and has ruled out the decision to hold the match in Delhi even if pollution levels are high
 is patr main ieme ne salaah di he ki BCCI ko pradooshan ko lekar ek policy banani chahie thi
 There should be a provision in the policy that there will be no match between increasing pollution
 magar philhal aisi koi policy nahin he
 No policy for pollution Indian Medical Association (IMA) President Dr KK Aggarwal said that it is a bad thing that even in the midst of so much pollution, there was a match in Delhi
 bharat or srilanka ke bich chal rahe match kopradooshan ke karanroka janaa chahie tha
 But once again there was no reason for no policy
 hamane bisisiai ko kaha he ki agar aap visibility kam hone par lite jalaakar match khel sakate hai to aisi bhi koi policy taiyaar kiijie ki jab pradooshan badha hua ho tab koi match naa ho
 PM 2
 5 jab tak 100 se neeche naa ho, tab tak to aap khel hi nahin sakate
 When the match was happening, then PM2
 5 kaa level 300 tak tha
 Making fun of Sri Lankan players Wrong IMA President Dr KK Aggarwal said that those who made fun of Sri Lankan players for pretending to save the match should know that PM2 in Colombo
 5 kaa level sirf 50 he
 That is, Sri Lankan players were really having problems
 aapako bataa den ki virendra sahvaag se lekar kai khilaadiyon ne srilankai khilaadiyon ke mask lagane ko lekar majaak udaaya tha
 It is condemnable
 viraat ko dekhakar bacchepradooshanmen khelengecricket khilaadi youth ikon hai
 In such a situation, if only the players play the match in such a pollution, then the other people will play it after seeing them
 viraat kohli aaj desh ke khilaadiyon ke youth ikon hai
 Now if Virat Kohli will play in such a pollution then any child will think why i cannot play
 dilli main pehlepradooshankam karnaa hoga uske baad hi koi bhi match yahaan khelaa ja saktaa he

 kartarpur coridor ke sanchaalan ke liye pakistan ne bharat ke sabhi prastaavon kaa virodh karte hue apni kai sharten or niyam tay kar die hai
 India proposes that the Kartarpur Corridor, one of the holiest sites of the Sikhs, be opened throughout the year to facilitate pilgrims
 lekin pakistan ne is prastaav kaa virodh kiya he
 Officials gave this information on Saturday
 kartarpur sikhon ke pehle guru nanak dev kii karmasthali he
 Pakistan opposed all the proposals of India, saying that only 700 pilgrims can visit the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur
 bharat ke prastaav, paak kaa inkaarek sarkari afasar ke mutabik pakistan ne kaha ki tirthayatriyon ko kartarpur special permit system ke tahat hi aane diya jayega saath hi iske liye shulk bhi chukaana hoga
 At the same time, India had proposed that there should be no visa nor any travel fees for pilgrims coming to Kartarpur
 bharat kaa yah bhi prastaav tha ki bhartiya nagarikon ke alaava pravasi bharatiyon ko bhi tirthayatra par aane kii ijaajat di jaae
 But Pakistan refused and said that only Indian citizens would be allowed to come
 700 yatriyon ko hi ijajatbharat kaa yah bhi prastaav tha ki tirthayatriyon ko puure saal or hafte ke saaton din tirthayatra karne di jaae
 But Pakistan remained adamant here too
 usne kaha ki tirthayatriyon ko jab anumati di jaaegi, tabhi vah aa paaenge
 India said that every day 5000 people should be allowed to do pilgrimage but Pakistan said that no more than 700 pilgrims will be allowed
 haalanki pakistan ne bharat ke us prastaav par koi jawaab nahin diya, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki khaas dinon par 10 hajaar logon ko darshan kii anumati di jaae
 India said that whether a person is alone or in a group, he should be allowed to come
 lekin pakistan ne kaha ki 15 logon ke samooh ko hi aane kii ijaajat di jaaegi
 Pakistan also rejected India's proposal to build a bridge over the Ravi river
 iske alaava kartarpur sahib coridor main tirthayatriyon ke paidal aane ke prastaav par koi jawaab nahin diya
 "despite Pakistan's non-cooperation, the construction work of Kartarpur Corridor is going on fast and the project will be finished before November 12, 2019," an official said

 dhamaake ke vakt vah khud ko nae saal kii party ke dauraan madhya moscow main dhamaakaa karne ke liye taiyaar kar rahi thi
 Avoidance of the blasts could only happen because the belt of the body of the female human bomb trained by the North Coxus Militant exploded before reaching the center of the city
 duusari mahila maanav bam is ghatana se ghabaraakar bhaag rahi thi magar use police ne giraftaar kar liya rus kii rashtriya aatankwaad virdohi cameti kaa kahana he, dhamaake ke kaaran us mahila maanav bam kii maut ho gai

 Bihar's Deputy Chief Minister and Lalu Yadav's son, has lashed out at the media
 unhone apane fasebuk post main likhaa ki lalu or unke parivaar se media gharaanon va unke 'corporate' karmiyon kaa vishesh lagaav kisi se chupa nahin he
 This is the same kind of attachment as the BJP has with Lalu ji
 dukhati nabz vaala ahsaas! naa pasand kiya jaae or naa nazarandaaz kiya jaae! sautela vyavhaar bataanaa, ise kamatar karne ke baraabar mana jayega
 How many journalists are not working in Bihar in the name of Lalu ji? For almost four decades, Lalu has been one of the strong pillars of national politics and whether one likes it or not, he remains the undisputed top leader in the country's politics
 chaahe centre yaa rajya main satta se dur rahe yaa hissaa bane rahe, kintu praasangikta or prasiddhi main kabhi koi kami nahin ai
 Sometimes he was said to be gullible and sometimes to be funny and funny as a prankster
 is par bhi jab dil naa bharaa to har choti-moti asafalataa par rajnatik ant kii gaatha suna di gai
 But each time prejudice victims had to drink sips of blood
 kabhi rail mantri ke apane kaarykaal se aalochakon ko pani bharne par majaboor kiya, to baar-baar darj kii gai apni vaapasi se virdohi ke chaati par saanp lotwa diya
 The big bjp's Turam Khan kept his support and dream of making a dent in the mass base, but every time he dug his face
 saamaajik nyaay ke apane sangharsh se jis aitihaasik saamaajik badlaav kii unhone neenv rakhi, vah krantikari tha
 The peaceful awakening of the large but oppressed section of the society is an achievement in itself
 par har ullekhneey uplabdhi or kaaryon ko chhupaakar par nakaaratmak pahalu kahin se bhi paidaa saamne kar dene kii kavayad bhaajapa samarthit media khub pahachaanata he
 Lalu ji is true cow spinach, cow servant
 kintu dusron ko isi baat par mahimamandit karne vaali media ne kabhi lalu ji kii is baat par prakaash nahin daalaa
 Perhaps this leader coming from the cow foster class has created a turmoil in the stronghold politics of the elite class with majority support
 adwani ke rath ko rokkar desh ko sampradayik aag se bachaane vaale is nayak ko kabhi apekshit shrey nahin mila
 Lalu ji is a true worshiper and also very religious
 har parv, tyohaar ko puri shraddha se manaate hai
 But he was never awarded the image of a true religious Hindu
 kya duusare dharmon ke dharmavalambiyon par aag uglana hi aapako sachcha hindu kahalava saktaa he? chhath puja puraa parivaar puri tallin hokar manaata he, jis par puure soobe kii nazar hoti he
 But as if it is a festival of some other religion, dedication and reverence for religion is not exposed at all
 bihar ke hansee, thitholi or geet sangeet vaali lok lubhaavan holi ko lalu ji ne hi rashtriya str par lokapriy banaaya
 Lalu ji's house is the temple for worship, but has the media ever shown it? Yes, but how many kilos do Yogi ji sing sing, what color does cow dung do
 yah media karmi ko kanthsth he
 When Tej Pratap ji goes to Shirdi, Vrindavan, Vindhyavasini or Mathura, it is declared a walk instead of a pilgrimage, but when Modi or Yogi do the same, then the media faces such pearls as the worship of God
 To be an incarnation of God himself
 lalu ji har varsh makar sankranti ke din hazaron garibon ko bhojan karavaate hai
 But only on the footage of guest leaders, the cameras get stuck
 lalu ji se jude har sakaaratmak pahalu ko chupa dene yaa nazarandaaz karne kii koshish hoti he
 By making small things small, big things are created and negative is created
 purvaagrah se vivash, virodhiyon ke anargal aaropon ko hi apni bhashaa banaaya jaataa he, jaanch se pehle hi ghotaalaa shabd jod diya jaataa he or jaanch main kuch nahin milane par maafi maangane kaa shishtachar bhi nahin dikhaaya jaataa he
 Doubtless doubt is raised on the credibility of the reverse investigation
 agar lalu parivaar se koi privet aspataal main ilaaj karavaayega, to kaha jayega ki janata ko lachar swasthya vyavastha par ashrith chhod khud nijee aspataal main ilaaj karavaate hai or sarkari aspataal main ilaaj karavaate hai, to kehete hai sarkari tantra kaa durupyog ho rahaa he, dhong ho rahaa he
 According to the protocol available to public representatives, government doctors are consulted, then there is a ruckus, that is, the Lalu family should not get treatment
 chit bhi meri, pat bhi meraa
 If you kill, then pretend to be tolerant, if you retaliate, violent attitude
 are bijepi samarthit media ke logon, kitni ghrinaa or purvaagrah paaliega? agar vanchit or bahusankhyak samudaay kaa utthan itnaa kachotata he, to sidhe mudde par aghat kiijie, khule main aaie, apane paaramparik vaimnasy or shreshthata kii bhaavana ko sweekaariye or badal dijie agar badalane kii takat ho to
 Stop this proxy war of propaganda and let the Bahujan community humiliate yourself by giving up round words on your prejudiced double attitude
 par kam se kam bijepi ke haathon bikne ke baad apane aapako loktantr kaa chauthaa stambh mat kahie
 You are hurting your own profession by doing bjp's chanting and chanting
 lalu kaa naa kuch bigadaa he or naa bigadega
 The blessings and blessings of millions of poor people are with them

 ) Last December, an intelligence alert from Arunachal increased the heat at the headquarters of the Eastern Military Command at Fort William, Kolkata
 adivasee shikariyon ne upree siyang jile ke tooting sector main doordaraj ke ek gaanv ke paas jo bhartiya seemaa kshetra main padataa he, china ke nirmaan dal ko kaam karte dekha
 The warning came within just three months of the 73-day-long conflict between the Indian Army and the People's Liberation Army of China (PLA) in the Doklam plateaus of Bhutan
 sena tatkaal harakat main ai or teji se us ore badi lekin gashti dal ko us jagah ko khojane ke liye 11 dinon tak paidal march karnaa padaa
 The news was confirmed
 china kaa sadak nirmaan dal sach main ek aisi sadak kii neenv rakh rahaa tha jo bhartiya kshetra se hokar guzarati
 The Indian jawans confiscated all the material including two earth movers (large machines like JCB used for soil removal and digging)
 sadak nirmaan karne vaale log jo ki chini naagarik the, vahaan se bhaag khadey hue
 The army erected a six-foot-high and 20-foot broad wall there so that no road-building activity from the Chinese side could occur again in that area
 bhartiya sena ne china kii ore se mili is bharose ke baad ki ve ab yahaan sadak nahin banaaenge, unki mashine lautaa deen or pichley dinon jaisi katutaa kii sthiti phir se khadi nahin hone di
 About a month later, on 26 January, two Border Jawan Milan programs were organized between the PLA and the Indian Army in Daulat Beg Oldi and Chusul in eastern Ladakh
 doklam vivaad ke baad khushnuma maahaul main donon deshon ke sainikon ke bich yah pehali mulaakaat thi
 But the army is not willing to take any risk
 doklam ke baad bhartiya sena khaastaur se purvi kaman haai alert par he
 There are many sectors under this command which are disputed and where it is difficult to reach and monitor

 After 73 days of fighting, on August 28, when both India and China agreed to repel their forces from the Doklam Plateau, Beijing's diplomatic fray sparked a debate as to who was ultimately the winner
 kai hafton tak bharat ko sabak sikhaane kii dhauns ke baad china ne shantipurna tareeke se nibatara karte hue sena ko peeche bula liya
 The decision was described by Chinese social media users as a moral defeat for China
 chini janamanas kii aisi raay rahi ki is vivaad main bharat vijeta rahaa or china ko puure prakaran main sharmindagi ke alaava kuch nahin mila
 In recent months, Beijing's military strategists began to eliminate the embarrassment of demonstrating that the Doklam dispute gave the Chinese military some new experimentation opportunities that would later prove beneficial to China
 isse doklam or vaastavik niyantran rekha ke duusare sector ko lekar ranneeti banane main badi sahaayta milegi
 "in the southern region of China there have been many flaws, but the Doklam episode forced China to remove them," Major General Peng Guangmen of the PLA said at a forum in Beijing in December, introducing rare speculation
 ham iske liye bharat kaa aabhaar vyakt karte hai
 "major General should not take this thing as mere eloquence because he has made a big point in gesture
 Of course China pulled back from its plan of road expansion in Siliguri Corridor on 28 August and removed the machines but this plateau He is strengthening his presence in other territories
 jaisaa ki india today ne pichley saal sitambar main sabase pehle yah report chhaapi thi ki piele bade dal or pehle se badi taiyaari ke saath waapas lautaa he
 The PLA has brought a ready-made home-based framework for permanent deployment of troops to the two ridges located very close to the disputed area so that more troops can be sent in a short period of time when needed and also sufficient military equipment in those border areas To be supplied where the Chinese Army was lagging behind till now
 upgrah se jo tasviren mili hai, unase is khabar kii pushti hui he
 However, the Ministry of External Affairs denied reports of the deployment of the Chinese again in that area
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne 19 janvari ko nai dilli main kaha, ''usee kshetra main phir se piele kii tainaati kii khabaren niraadhaar or shararthpurna hai
 "the Ministry of External Affairs has a legitimate reason
 china ne jampheri rij (dekhen graphics) kii ore sadak nirmaan kaary phir se shuru nahin kiya he
 The "chicken Neck", strategically important to India, can be monitored from Jumferi Ridge
 bhartiya sena ne isi samrik vajah se seemaa langhakar bhutan main pravesh kiya tha
 The PLA has slightly reduced its deployment in the 89-km plateau region in winter
 vah use donglong kahati he
 Army officers who monitor the area say that the number of PLK personnel currently deployed is difficult to count, but Chinese military activity in the area has been reported to be much lower than before
 haalanki sena, yah pakke taur par nahin bataa paa rahi ki tainaati main ai kami sardiyon ke kaaran he yaa piele sachmuch apni gatividhiyaan kam karne ko raji he
 Army Chief Bipin Rawat said in New Delhi on January 12, "the structure there suggests similar signs that PLK activities can resume once winter ends
" yadi ve phir se lautate hai to ham sthiti kii samiksha ke baad aage kii ranneeti tay karenge
 But i want to make one thing clear that diplomatic efforts are going in the right direction and everything seems to be normal between the two countries

 As the Indian Ambassador to China, he has played an important role in resolving the Doklam dispute
 isi bich, sena ne bhi prayaas kiya ki piele doklam ke donon rij kshetron se apni tainaati hataae lekin use koi khaas safalataa nahin mili
 Army officials admit in private that they do not have much in their hands as both these ridge areas fall within the Bhutan border and Bhutan has no longer asked the PLA to withdraw from its border
 unhen andeshaa he ki yah pathaar kshetra chumbi ghati ke saare purvi ilaake main piele kii sthaayee ghuspaith kaa ek or centre ban jayega
 This valley is a strip of Tibetan territory

 The PLA is preparing the infrastructure

 Since the conflict, Beijing has strengthened its deployment at Lhasa and Shigetse, two of Tibet's largest airbases
 khufia vishleshan karne vaali sanstha stretfor ne upgrah se praapt chitron main saaf-saaf dikhaaya he ki pichley saal agast se china ne in airbase par apane jahaajon kii sankhya kaaphi badhaai he jo aktubar main sarvaadhik thi
 Both airbase photographs show "deployment of helicopters and early air warning and control aircraft KJ-500, surface-to-air long-range HQ-9 missiles and unmanned aerial vehicle Tire Dragon at Shigetse Peace Airport
" Has increased
 "stretfor ne bataaya ki doklam sankat ke baad bhartiya vaayu sena ne pashchim bengal ke apane simavarti hawaii addon haasimara or bagdogra par esayu-30emkei yudhak vimaanon kii tainaati badha di he, lekin tabhi se china kii taraf sainya buniyadi dhaanche kaa nirmaan bhi tej ho gaya he
 According to a Stratfor report, "china quickly chalked it up to a massive increase in its air deployment to Shigetseh immediately after the dispute
" disambar ke madhya main ek nayaa ranve banaaya gaya, saath hi saath airbase ke anya nirmaanon kii marammat karai gai
 "this brought joy to the people of the PLA who objected to reforms introduced in the PLA since 2016 by President Xi Jinping
 unka aarope tha ki raashtrapati kaa dhyaan nausena ko badhaane par he jabaki thal sena kii ahmiyat ko nazarandaaj karte hue ve uske sankhyabal ko maujuuda 23 lakh se ghataakar 10 lakh ke neeche laana chaahate hai
 Zhou Bo, a strategist at the PLA Academy of Military Science, says in an article written in January, "the situation is completely opposite to what the Indian media promotes about Doklam, and this controversy is not a policy victory for India either
" 
 china ke dabaav main pehle bhartiya sena ne kadam peeche khinche
 Even today the Chinese army is present in Doklam
 is vivaad ke maddenjar china ne yah saaf kar diya tha ki chini sena apane kshetra main gasht bhi jari rakhegi or sadak nirmaan kaa kaam bhi puraa karegi
 Road construction work is going to be started soon, though it will not be in the same area
 "jhau kehete hai, ''doklam vivaad ne china ko apni sainya taiyaariyon ke sandarbh main phir se vichaar karne kii ek sikh bhi di he
 China will increase its construction in the border area in the near future
 ise dekhte hue bharat bhi apana nirmaan badhayega lekin china kii aarthik shakti or nirmaan kaaryon kii dakshata ko dekhte hue donon deshon kii seemaa par nirmaan kaary kii gati or kshamta kii koi tulana ho hi nahin sakati
 "since the conflict in Sikkim fifty years ago, not a single shot has been fired in this world's longest and most disputed actual control border area
 doklam jaise kai anya vivaadon ke phir se sir uthaane kii sambhaavna prabal he kyonki bharat ne bhi china kii seemaa se lage kshetron main apana nirmaan kaary tej kar diya he
 "the incidents and intensity of skirmishes and escalation will increase as our patrolling increases, as well as our capabilities," says Lt
 Gen
 Vinod Bhatia, director of military operations and former director general of the think tank Center for Joint Warfare Studies of the three wings of the Ministry of Defense
 Are expanding and we have also increased movement in the disputed area

 On this statement of PM Modi, Robert Vadra retorted and wrote on his Facebook, Respected, Prime Minister! i am surprised to hear your name again at your rally

 unhone kaha ki congress kah rahi he ki agar dilli main uski sarkaar bani to, jammu-kashmir samet jo hinsa vaale ilaake hai, vahaan tainaat sainikon se unka vishesh adhikaar chin liya jayega

 china ke liye bharat kii gheraabandi karnaa itnaa aasaan bhi nahin he
 Through Malabar military exercises, India along with the US and Japan has shown their strength to China
 jisko lekar china hameshaa se chidhaa rahata he
 Today there is an international news that will break China's confusion about India's strength
 jis bhram main china bharat ko dhamkiyaan detaa he auki ye kahata he ki uski sainya takat china ke saamne kuch nahin he do international newclear export ne apni ek report main bataaya he ki bharat kii apane kisi bhi hisse se china ke kisi bhi hisse ko apni missile power ke target main lene kii kshamta he
 The world also believes the missile power of India, so China, threatening 62, should not be under any illusion
 kyonki america ke do bade newclear exparts kii ek tazaa report main ye kaha gaya he kibharat aisi missile power bana rahaa he, jisamen china ke har shahar ko target karne kii kshamta he
 Right now, through the Agni-4 missile, India can target every city of China from the northeast
 lekin agni-5 ke paanch hazaar kilometre ke range se wo bharat main kahin se bhi china ko nishaanaa bana saktaa he
 This means that if the missile goes from Chennai, it will destroy Shanghai in the corner of China
 ek america online magazine main chhapi is report main bharat kii parmaanu takat or parmaanu takat se las mixilon ke bare main khaastaur par zikr kiya gaya he, jisamen do Hans m Kristensen or Robert s Norris ne likhaa he:bharat ke paas 150 se 200 newclear hathiyaar banane kii kshamta kaa plutonium maujuud he
 However, India currently has 120 to 130 nuclear weapons
 bharat kii newclear ranneeti khaastaur par pakistan par focus rahi he
 But now India's focus is steadily moving towards China
 bharat ke paas abhi saat newclear kshamta se las dephence system kaam kar rahe hai
 It has two air, four ground and one marine base ballistic missile system
 is international report main daawa kiya gaya ki bharat kam se kam aise chaar or par kaam kar rahaa he, jinhen mumkin he kii china ko dekhte hue agle das saalon main tainaat kar diya jayega
 Considering the strength of India's missiles, this report said that India has Agni-2 missile, which can go up to 2 thousand km target with nuclear warheads
 jisamen china kaa pashchimi, madhya or dakshin kaa puraa ilaaka target main aa saktaa he
 The Agni-4 missile can target almost every city in China from the northeast, including Beijing and Shanghai
 lekin ab bharat aisi takat viksit kar rahaa he
 With this, it will have the ability to target any city of China from any of its bases in Central India and South India
 agar kisi netaa kii sabha main koi apriy ghatana hoti he to kya uskaa saamana karne ke liye hamaare jawan taiyaar hai
 Can our jawans save a leader or a big figure from any crisis? in sabhi sawaalon kaa jawaab ‘haa’ main hi milegaa
 Because our soldiers are ready everywhere and ready to deal with any crisis
 is baat kaa saboot hamaare javaanon ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saamne hi diya
 Recently, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived to participate in the 50th Foundation Day of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), the security forces also gave an example of this
 ek mock drill ke jariye surakshabalon ne kisi bhi sankat se nipatane kii sthiti ko dikhaaya
 Here the mock drill showed that if a leader is addressing the rally and at the same time there is an attack in the rally then how the security forces respond to the attackers there while protecting the leader, keeping the public safe
 chunki, is prakaar kii sthiti main sabase pehle pad par baithe vyakti ko vahaan se nikaalnaa jaruri hota taaki halaat zyada naa bigaden
 The mock drill shows the security forces evacuating the leader safely from the spot amidst frequent explosions and shootings

 While advising Indians to pay more attention to the removal of corruption, the religious leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama said that he fully supports Anna Hazare's movement
 haalanki unhone andolan ke tareeke par kuch kehane se inkaar kar diya
 Describing Tibetans as disciples and India as gurus, he said that issues like corruption have to bring shame to the disciples
 dalai lamas ne kaha ki bharat main log maanane lage hai ki bhrashtachar jivan kaa hissaa ban gaya he or vah chaatro or vyapaariyon se baat karne ke baad is nattejey par pahunche hai
 He said, many people have some reservations about Anna's methods but inspiration is very important
 logon ne sochna shuru kar diya he ki bhrashtachar jivan kaa hissaa he
 This movement reminds the nation and politicians that corruption is a completely wrong thing

 The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has been in the limelight since October last year due to infighting
 maamla supreme court tak pahunch gaya he or court ne sarkaar ke faisle ko palat diya
 The cbi's credibility has certainly been discounted by these incidents
 darasal 23 oktober 2018 ko modi sarkaar ne bhrashtachar ke aarope main sibiai chif alok verma or rakesh aasthaana ko chuttee par bhej diya or nageshwar raav ko sibiai kaa antarim nideshak niyukt kar diya
 But the Supreme Court, while giving verdict on the plea of alok Verma, upheld the government's decision and ordered the CBI chief to hand over the charge to Verma immediately
 lekin phir isi 10 janvari ko pradhanmantri narendra modi kii adhyakshata main ucchstareey chayan samiti ne alok verma ko sibiai nideshak ke pad se hataa diya or nageshwar raav ko dobaaraa antiram nideshak bana diya
 a petition has also been filed against this decision in the Supreme Court
 bataa den, desh main sibiai ek aisi jaanch agency he, jise janata hameshaa nishpaksh dekhnaa chaahati he
 But what has happened in the past, people have many questions about the CBI
 'ajtak' ne karvi incits ke saath milakar sibiai kii saakh ko lekar ek survey kiya
 People were asked in the survey that despite whatever happened inside this institution in the past, you are confident of the cbi's investigation against corruption today? In the survey, 12 percent of the people directly responded that now they have no faith in the CBI investigation
 is
 jabaki 31 fisadi logon ne kaha ki pichley dinon ke ghatnakram ko dekhakar ab sibiai par bharosa kam hua he
 Whereas 41 per cent believe that after the CBI uproar, there is more confidence in this agency
 16 fisadi logon ne is sawaal par chuppi saadh lee yaa phir kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kar diya
 In the survey, 43 percent of the people have lost faith in this agency after a dispute in the CBI
 haalanki 41 fisadi logon kaa kahana he ki sibiai ab or sakhti ke saath bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii jaanch karegi
 This survey has been done on January 2019
