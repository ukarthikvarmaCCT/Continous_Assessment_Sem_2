 The people and farmers of the state are worried about the Cauvery water dispute
 aise main agar rajya ke log ipel ke maichon kaa majaa lenge to yah shame kii baat hogi

 Had increased 75 thousand million cubic (TMC) feet and reduced the same share of Tamil Nadu

 There is a discussion again that Kiran Bedi may come to BJP
 pichley do chunaavon se pehle dilli main yah charchaa kahin se uthati he or hawa main ghoomane lagati he
 Kiran Bedi, as always, has not denied or agreed to this article till this time
 shaayad unki shakhsiyat kaa asar he ki lagane lagata he ki vah arvind kejariwal kaa jawaab ho sakati hai
 If Kiran Bedi comes to BJP, it will be a big change in bjp's strategy
 abhi tak vah har jagah pradhanmantri narendra modi ke lokapriy chehre par hi chunaav jitate ja rahi he
 The victory of Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand is well known
 jammu-kashmir kii kamyaabi bhi koi maamuli nahin he
 Regarding the Delhi Assembly elections, the BJP has repeatedly said that the face of the party is the Prime Minister
 dilli main lage bhaajapa ke tamaam postaron par kisi dilli ke netaa kaa photo bhi nahin he
 With every slogan and promise, there is only Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 to kya bijepi yah maan legi ki dilli main use modi ke alaava kisi or chehre kii bhi zarurat he
 The state president of the BJP has been saying that in Delhi also the BJP will not go to the polls with the candidate of the chief minister
 modi se bada cheharaa koi nahin he
 The Aam Aadmi Party deemed it a weakness and without announcement announced Jagdish Mukhi as its candidate
 mukhi ko kamazor jaan 'aap' ne tamaam tarah ke survey dilli ke auto par chipka daale
 As a result, like last time, this time too, AAP pushed a BJP leader to the margins before the elections
 bijepi dilli ke is puraane or jame hue netaa kaa bachaav nahin kar saki
 The party felt that Jagdish Mukhi would not be able to stand in front of Kejriwal, so he went to the margins on his own
 pehle bhi mukhyadhara main nahin the
 The Aam Aadmi Party did the same with Vijay Goel
 'aap' kii yahi ranneeti is baar bhi lagati he
 On Wednesday, Arvind Kejriwal surrounded BJP state president Satish Upadhyay
 donon taraf se aarope-pratyaropon ke daur chal rahe hai, lekin satish upaadhyaay ke baikfoot par jate hi kyon kiran bedi kaa naam phir se hawa main uchhaala jane laga he
 Is the BJP still looking for a leader within Delhi? kya yah ho saktaa he ki loksabhaa chunaav kii shandaar kamyaabi ke baad bhaajapa har chunaav modi ke naam par ladane kaa formula badal degi
 If BJP does this then its victory will also go to the account of Aam Aadmi Party
 'aap' hi baar-baar puch rahi he ki bataaie, mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar koun he
 The party used to take Modi's name proudly and for 'AAP' it was difficult to attack Modi directly, but with Kiran Bedi coming up, the competition will become equal, interesting and kill
 kiran bedi raajnneeti nahin karnaa chaahati
 She left the Aam Aadmi Party on this question, but has been supporting Narendra Modi on Twitter
 jawaab kiran bedi ko dena padegaa ki raajnneeti main aane kaa faisla kisi bade pad ke vaade ke saath rukaa hua tha yaa yah koi vishesh paristhiti he, jisase bachaane ke liye vah apana balidaan de rahi he, lekin loksabhaa chunaavon ke daur main jab bhrashtachar ke aaropon se ghiri congress ke saath kiran bedi kaa naam uchhalata tha to vah aasaani se chunaav ladane se manaa kar detii thim
 Kiran Bedi has been very vocal about the Lokpal and police reforms, but she has been quiet on both these issues for the past few months
 in donon hi masalon par unka koi sangharshnuma bayaan nahin dikhaa he
 This question will be asked that if politics was to be done then why did we keep away from Arvind
 kya party main chande ke sawaal par jis paardarshita kii maang kiran bedi or kejariwal karte rahe hai, kya uskaa jawaab bedi ko bijepi main mil gaya he
 Generally, Kiran Bedi has also shown restraint regarding Kejriwal so far
 alag hokar bhi vah garimapurna tareeke se aalochanaon or hamale se dur rahi hai, lekin maidan main utarane par to sidhaa arvind kejariwal ko nishane par lenaa hoga
 The competition between honest individuals will be strong
 bas fark yah hoga ki ek raajnneeti ke maidan main do saal se he
 Walking in the streets of Delhi
 kejariwal ke saamne kiran bedi ko kam samay main vishwasaneeyata banani hogi
 Perhaps the bjp's organization and its government at the center should remove this shortfall through the media, but the fight will be interesting
 ye sab atakalein hai
 It happens at the time of election
 atakalein lekhan-vishleshan kaa hissaa ban jaaya karti hai, par nazar lagaae rakhie
 Kiran Bedi will not be seen as a candidate only if she comes to BJP
 bijepi bhale ghoshnaa na kare, lekin maan hi liya jayega ki bijepi kii taraf se mukhyamantri kii ummidavaar vahi hai
 Will the BJP contest elections with the help of former Aam Aadmi Party leaders
 shazia ilmi bhi bijepi ke liye prachaar karne kii baat kar rahi hai
 From Binny to Upadhyay have also come in BJP, will there be a fight between two teams that emerged from the Lokpal movement
 phir yah jeet bijepi kii hogi yaa kiran bedi ilmi yaa kejariwal kii
 Politics offers so many interesting opportunities for analysis and speculation

 surat ke builder or kaarobaari shaulesh bhatta ke aarope ne in dinon gujarat police kii neend uda rakhi he
 Shailesh Bhatt has accused the Amreli police and state CBI officer Sunil Nair of complaining to the State CID Crime Branch that the officials of these two agencies have taken Rs 17 crore from him by threatening the encounter
 isamen 5 karod rupee sibiai ke sunil nair ne liye hai, jabaki 12 karod rupee ke bitcoin amarelli jile ke esaspi jagadish patel or police inspector anant patel ne liye hai
 In fact, during demonetisation, this Surat merchant came in contact with another Surat merchant Kirit Paladiya to invest his money
 bhatta is vyapaaree se bitcoin main deal karata rahaa
 Thus he got around 200 bitcoins
 vyapaaree ke shikaayat ke mutabik iske baad sibiai adhikari sunil nair ne use phone kar dhamkaaya or use milane sibiai daftar bulaayaa
 According to the complaint, he was beaten up in a torture room by a CBI officer
 saath hi sibiai adhikari ne chhodane ke liye usase 10 karod rupee kii maang kii
 However, the deal was signed between the two for Rs 5 crore
 iske baad vyapaaree ne sunil nair ko 5 karod rupee transfar kar diya
 After which Sunil Nayar left him
 haalanki, vyapaaree kii musiibat yaheen khatm nahin hui
 No officer should bother again, so Shoulesh Bhatt reached Nair to take the NOC, but he refused to give the NOC
 vahaan se nilke bhatta ko amarelli police ne achaanak gandhinagar ke paas petrol pump se uthaa le gai
 Shailesh Bhatt got suspicious when the police took him, not with him, to a farm house near Gandhinagar, where he was horribly killed and asked him to transfer 200 bitcoins
 saath hi aisa na karne par encounter kii dhamkee bhi di gai
 After which he transferred 200 bitcoins worth Rs 12 crore to Kirit Paladiya's account
 is puure maamle main shailesh bhatta kii ankhen us samay khuli kii khuli rah gayi jab use pataa chalaa ki sibiai or amarelli police ke saath vahi shaks mila hua he jisane use bitcoin kii kharid karnaa sikhaaya
 Shoulesh Bhatt gave Rs 5 crore to the CBI and Rs 17 crore to the Amreli police, many proofs of which are also available with him
 haalanki, is maamle main wo baar-baar police ke paas shikaayat lekar gaya, lekin police uski shikaayat lene ko taiyaar nahin thi
 Meanwhile, he met former BJP MLA Nalin Kotadia and Nalin Kotadia asked him to take him to Home Minister Pradeep Singh Jadeja, but on the second day Nalin Kotadia's voice also changed
 naleen kotdia ne use amarelli police ko or 10 karod rupee dene kii baat kar maamle ko khatm karne kii baat kahi
 Shoulesh Bhatt was quite scared, he somehow met his colleagues and met Home Minister Pradeep Singhjadeja and Pradeep Singh handed over the investigation to the state CID Crime

 dilachasp yah he ki lakhanu kaa jo prasad medical college is ghotaale kii jaanch centre main he, use medical concil of india (emsiai) ne phir student ke admician ke liye ijaajat dene se inkaar kar diya he
 The decision was taken at a meeting of mci's General Body in December
 medical ghotaale kii shuruyaat isi medical college se hui thi
 Along with this, 29 other medical colleges tried to get permission for admission of students in academic year 2016-17 without necessary infrastructure
 emsiai dwaara 2015 main kiye gaye akalan main bataaya gaya tha ki college kii facalti aadhi (52%) hi he, isi tarah resident doctors kii sankhya bhi aadhi (54 %) he
 The hospital bed occupancy was just 52% and there were no patients in the ICCU
 aspataal main koi nursing stesan, ejamination room, pentry, store room, duty room, demenastration room nahin tha
 For this reason, the Executive Council of MCI did not allow the college
 pichley saal is college main embibies course ke first year ke liye 150 students ko admician diya gaya tha
 The future of these students hangs in the balance
 emsiai or iske baad swasthya mantralay ne ijaajat isliye waapas le lee thi, kyonki college main kai tarah kii aniyamitataayen pai gayi
 The Principal did not allow mci's investigation team to visit the college
 iske baavjood supreme court dwaara niyukt aar em lodha cameti ne kuch sharton ke aadhaar par college admician kii ijaajat de di, sirf college kii website par mili jaankaree ke aadhaar par
 But later when the irregularities of the college came to know, the college was again banned for two years
 is faisle se raahat ke liye colejasupreme court mengya or usne ritred jaj ai em kuddusi se bhi sampark kiya
 After this, ignoring the recommendation of the MCI and the Ministry of Health, the Chief Justice reduced the two-year ban on the college to one year
 is tarah 2017-18 ke acadmic year ko shunya maanate huekolege kaagale saal ke liye raahat de di gai
 Shiv Sena has accused Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis of apologizing to the farmers, accusing the BJP government of Maharashtra of cheating farmers
 shivasena ne shanivaar ko kaha ki 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan bhaajapa ne kisaanon se karj maafee kaa jhootha vaada kar unhen dhokhaa diya
 The Shiv Sena wrote in an editorial in the party mouthpiece 'saamana', "the Chief Minister told the Legislative Assembly that the state government cannot forgive farmers' debt
 unhen chunaav se pehle kisaanon ko jhuthe aashwaasan dekar dhokhaa dene par maafee maangani chahie
 '' patr main yah bhi kaha gaya, ‘‘aapako (bhaajapa ko) yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie
 You came to power with the promise that you will not let any farmer in the state commit suicide
 ’’ sampadakeey main shivasena ne suzav diya ki mukhyamantri ko un kisaanon ke parijanon se mulaakaat kerani chahie jinhone khudakushi kar lee or unki jaan na bachaa paane ke liye sarkaar kii aakshamata par maafee maangani chaiye
 The Shiv Sena also expressed surprise that Fadnavis is seeking a guarantee from opposition members in the assembly that farmers will not commit suicide after the government waives its debts
 shivasena ne kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne notebandi ke baad ke prabhaav ke taur par kai vaade kiye the lekin unamem se kuch bhi amal main nahin aayaa
 The letter also said, "you (BJP) should not forget this
" is vaade ke saath satta main aae the ki aap rajya main kisi kisaan ko khudakushi nahin karne denge
 In the editorial, the Shiv Sena suggested that the Chief Minister should meet the families of those farmers who committed suicide and apologize for the government's inability to save their lives
 shivasena ne is baat par bhi aashcharya jataayaa ki fadanvis vidhansabha main vipakshi sadasyon se is baat kii guarantee maang rahe hai ki sarkaar ke karj maaf kar dene ke baad kisaan khudakushi nahin karenge
 The Shiv Sena said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had made many promises as to the post-demonetisation effect, but none of them materialized
 maharashtra main bijepi-shivasena kaa 25 saal purana gathbandhan tut gaya
 Since the break-up of the alliance, the question was arising as to who would accompany the smaller parties of the Mahayuti? Shiv Sena or BJP
 aaj tak ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik, ye partiyaan chunaav main bijepi ke saath ja sakati hai
 Sources said that it seems more beneficial to combine these parties with BJP
 iskaa elaan jald ho saktaa he
 Meanwhile, Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan has claimed that the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) can ally with the BJP
 bijepi-ensipi ke bich kuch pak rahaa haih prithviraj chavhanensipi ke congress ke saath gathbandhan todane ke elaan ke kuch der baad hi maharashtra ke mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan ne kaha ki bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan tuutane ke kuch der baad hi ensipi ne bhi apana faisla sunaaya, yah behad hi rochak he
 The main reason for the break-up of the alliance is Ajit Pawar's desire to become the Chief Minister and a partnership with the BJP in power at the Center
 15 saal main yah pehali baar hua he, jab ensipi ne 30 maheene ke liye apni party ke liye mukhyamantri pad maanga
 That too on the last chance
 haalanki bijepi ne congress ke in daavon ko khaarij kar diya
 Maharashtra BJP President Devendra Fadnavis said that this is not going to happen
 bijepi kisi bhi keemat par sharad pavaar kii party ke saath gathbandhan nahin karegi
 The Congress will form an alliance with the SP, among all, the Congress has started capitalizing on the good performance of the Samajwadi Party in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly by-election
 prithviraj chavaan ne kaha, 'ham samaajawaadee party ke saath gathbandhan karne vaale hai
 We took all the decisions in the interest of Maharashtra and not the allies of the alliance
 ' vahiin, sapa netaa abu azmi ne kaha ki puure desh kii secular takaton ko saath aana hoga taaki bijepi ko roka ja sake
 Broken shivsena-bjp alliance After 22 days of marathon meetings and heavy lifting, the 25-year-old alliance of BJP and Shiv Sena finally broke
 republican party of india (RPI), rashtriya samaaj paksh (RSP) or swabhimani shetakari sanghathan (SSS) jaisi choti partiyaan bhi is gathbandhan kii hissedaar thi
 After the Pulwama attack, every Indian is demanding strict action against the terrorists and their boss

 Malkhan Singh says that 700 rebels still exist in Madhya Pradesh, with whom they are ready to go to the border and die for the sake of the country
 patrakaron ke saath baatcheet main malakhan singh ne kaha ki agar sarkaar unhen parmishan de de to ve bina kisi shart or vetan ke pakistan se yuddh karenge
 If needed, we will give our lives for the sake of the country
 purv daaku malakhan singh kaa kahana tha ki unase likhva kar le liya jaae ki agar ve jang main maare gaye to koi aparaadh nahin hoga
 If he withdraws from this, his name is not Malkhan Singh
 purv dasyu sargana ne daawa karte hue kaha ki agar maa bhavani kaa arshivaad rahaa to koi malakhan singh kaa bal bhi baaka nahin kar saktaa
 Malkhan says that the Pulwama attack needs revenge
 bataate chalem ki malakhan ko chambal kaa sher kaha jaataa tha

 (news agency ieenes se input) On Thursday, the fourth and final day of the monsoon session of the Bihar Legislative Assembly, the Bihar State Industrial Area Development Authority (biada) created a ruckus by the opposition members over alleged land allotment and giving land to influencers
 sadan kii kaarywahi shuru hote hi vipakshi sadsy ekajute hokar hangaamaa karne lage or sadan ke bichombich aa gaye
 During this, Speaker Uday Narayan Chaudhary several times urged the opposition members to go to their seats, but they refused
 hangaame ke kaaran ant main sadan ko 12 baje tak sthagit karnaa padaa
 Earlier, opposition members outside the House shouted slogans with placards and posters
 idhar, vidhansabha main vipakshi dal ke netaa abdul baari siddiqui ne kaha ki is puure maamle kii jaanch kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) se karai jaae
 He said that the entire opposition is one about this matter
 vipakshi sadasyon ne mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke istife kii bhi maang kii he
 It is noteworthy that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday sought information from the Chief Secretary Anup Mukherjee about the entire matter
 is mudde par mangalvaar se hi sadan main vipakshi dalon ke log hangaamaa kar rahe hai
 It is alleged that Biada, a unit of the Government of Bihar, has monitored the land of the industrial area like ravines

 However, the party brushed aside Sakshi Maharaj's statement that it was his personal opinion
 udhar, badhate bavaal par sakshi maharaj ne yah kehete hue pallaa jhaad liya ki raat gai, baat gai
 Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said, 'has the BJP changed India's population policy without telling anyone? Or, the changing economy has got a new election slogan of 'ab ki bar, kid char' ' singhvi ne kaha ki pradhanmantri kaa nayaa naaraa 'abaki baar, bachche chaar' he yaa phir 'mek in india plus 4' he, modi is baat ko spasht karen
 Singhvi said, "in this way, Prime Minister Modi talks on every big and small issues
 vah neuyork se lekar australia or laal kile se chhattisgarh tak har mudde par baat karte hai
 They should say something even after making this statement of their MP and otherwise at least make a tweet
 'singhvi ne bijepi ke sabhi kaddavar netaaon ko gherte hue kaha, 'sakshi maharaj ne apni budhimata kaa parichay isse pehle apane bayaan main diya, tab pradhanmantri chup rahe
 Then he showed his wisdom and advised Hindu women to have four children and still the Prime Minister is silent
 sirf pradhanmantri hi nahin, grahamantri, vitt mantri, yahaan tak ki bijepi adhyaksh tak sabhi chup baithe hai, is khamoshi kaa matlab kya he?'singhvi ne kaha ki sakshi kaa bayaan darshata he ki mahilaon ko lekar bijepi kaa drushtikon kya he
 The Congress said, 'thinking of women as a machine to produce children is an insult to the power, ability and 50 percent of our population
 congress netaa anand sharma kaa kahana he ki bijepi ne yah sab foot dalwane ke liye karavaaya he, is harakat kaa makasad asli muddon se dhyaan bhatkaana he
 At the same time, BJP has withdrawn from this whole controversy and said that this is Sakshi Maharaj's own opinion, it does not make any sense to the party
 is vivaad ke baad bijepi ke rashtriya sachiv shrikant sharma ne party sadasyon ke liye ek bayaan jari kiya or kaha ki sabhi sadsy vikaas par dhyaan den na ki gairajaruri bayanon se bachein
 BJP MP from Unnao, Uttar Pradesh, Sakshi Maharaj has said that Hindu women should give birth to at least four children

 dilachasp baat yah he ki phiroti maangane vaala koi peshewar apradhi nahin, balki bathinda kii rahane vaali ek yuvati nikali he
 However, this girl who kidnapped the young man and demanded ransom could not succeed in her plans
 sirsa kii police ne use or uske do saathiyon ko range haath pakad liya he
 According to the police, Arpan Kaur of Bathinda district along with four of his colleagues kidnapped the convocation of the son of a businessman from Fatehabad and then demanded a ransom of one crore rupees from his family, but later the ransom amount was fixed at Rs 10 lakh
 
 police ke mutabik aaropee yuvati bathinda ke sangat kalam gaanv kii rahane vaali he
 Two of his accomplices arrested along with him are Lakhbir Singh and Gurmeet Singh from Fatehabad
 is apharan main punjab ke do yuvak bhi shaamil hai jo faraar hai
 According to police sources, the girl first befriended the young man's convocation through whatsapp and then implicated him in a web of love
 aaropee yuvati arpan kuch din pehle dikshant se milane fatehabad ai thi
 According to the plan, two of his local companions, Lakhbir Singh and Gurmeet Singh, were waiting at a dhaba with two more youths from Punjab
 planning ke mutabik yuvati ne dikshant ko ek hotel main bulaayaa or uske baad vah uski gaadi main baithkar uske saath us dhabas kii ore chal di jahaan par uske chaar saathi uskaa intjaar kar rahe the

 After the results of the Lok Sabha elections, its biggest impact is being seen in Karnataka
 kumaraswami sarkaar par lagaataar sankat ke badal mandara rahe hai
 The state leader of opposition, Jagdish Shettar, has questioned the existence of the current Kumaraswamy government after a quarrel in the Janata Dal Secular (JDS) and Congress coalition governments in Karnataka
 karnataka ke purv siem or bijepi ke varisht netaa shettar ne kaha he ki is gathbandhan sarkaar ko ab satta main bane rahane kaa naitik adhikaar nahin he
 He said, 'kumaraswamy no longer has the right to be the Chief Minister of Karnataka
 bijepi yahaan mukhya vipakshi party he or agar gathbandhan sarkaar rajya ko chalaane main asafal he to rajyapal ko swaabhaavik taur par sabase badi party bijepi ko sarkaar banane ke liye aamantrit karnaa chahie'
 Let me tell you that in the results of the Lok Sabha elections on May 23, the performance of JDS and Congress alliance in Karnataka was very disappointing and won only 2 seats
 jabaki bijepi ne is rajya main behad shandaar pradarshan karte hue 25 siton par kabja jamaa liya tha
 Soon after the election results came, reports of a ruckus in the jds-congress coalition government of Karnataka began to appear
 congress netaaon ke bijepi ke paale main jane kii atakalon ke bich somvaar ko hi rajya ke congress netaa or purv vidhayak ke en ranjana ne daawa kiya tha ki karnataka sarkaar tabhi tak he jab tak narendra modi ne pradhanmantri pad kii shapath nahin lee he, narendra modi ke shapath lete hi sarkaar gir jaaegi
 a day earlier, Congress leader Ramesh Jarkiholi and Dr Sudhakar met BJP leader r Ashok at the residence of Bharatiya Janata Party leader SM Krishna in Bengaluru, fueling speculation that the Kumaraswamy government would fall
 sarkaar girane kii ashankaon se ghabaraaye siem kumaraswami ne apane pravaktaaon or vidhayakon ko media se puri tarah duuri banaae rakhane kii hidaayat di thi
 For this, the party had issued a written decree
 ames main hue marpet maamle main peedit parivaar police jaanch se khush nahin he
 In this entire case, the police have registered a case under sections 323, 341, 354, 509 and 34 of the IPC
 bacchee ke pita or peedit asagar ali kaa kahana he ki ye jaanaleva hamalaa tha, unke or parivaar ke logon ko kaaphi chotein ai hai
 Many stitches have been broken, despite this, the police have registered a case in minor sections
 police aropiyon ke khilaaf karrwai nahin kar rahi he or na hi ames prashasan apni galati maan rahaa he
 While the police are accusing them, the police say that action is on
 maamle main shaamil 5 suraksha gards ko hiraasat main lekar poochtacha kii ja rahi he
 This ruckus is in the country's largest hospital AIIMS, where it is alleged that the security guards and bouncers of AIIMS are beating the sticks of the patients with sticks
 ames trama centre main marij ke parijanon kii pitayee kaa ek video saamne aayaa he, jisame ames trama centre main maujuud bounsar lathi dandon se marij ke parijan kii pitayee kar rahe hai
 People in the victim's family say that for the past few days, their 14-year-old daughter is admitted to the AIIMS Trauma Center, whose spinal surgery was performed on Saturday
 peedit parivaar kaa kahana he kii vizitor paas par 2 logon ko aspataal main andar jane kii ijaajat di jaati he lekin aspataal ke bounsar ek hi shaks ko andar jane de rahe the
 The matter started between the victim family and the hospital bouncer and the angry bouncer beat the whole family with sticks
 hairaani vaali baat ye he ki video main aspataal ke bounsar parijanon kii danda se pitayee karte saaf najar aa rahe he or police mookadarshak baniin najar aa rahi he
 Many people from the same family were seriously injured in this whole incident
 vahi duusari ore ames prashasan kaa kahana he ek peedit paksh ke kai log jabardastee aspataal ke andar ghusane kii koshish kar rahe the or bounsar ne roka to unki taraf ke kareeb 30 logon ne pehle marpet shuru kii
 But many people on both sides have been injured and the AIIMS administration will investigate the matter and take action against the security personnel if it goes wrong
 haalanki is puure maamle ke baad ames par kai sawaal uthaae ja rahe hai, jab itani zyada chot lagi to police ne hatya ke prayaas kaa maamla kyon darj nahin kiya
 Why the case was filed in light streams
 is ghatana ke baad marij bhi ames main apni suraksha ko lekar chintit hai

 # Repost @redchilliesent ・ ・ ・ This has left us with so many questions


 stay tuned to know more! @iamsrk @netflix_ina post shared by Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) on Aug 21, 2019 at 8:22 am PDT Earlier, Shah Rukh Khan (shah Rukh Khan) shared another video
 is video main unke paas interogeter kii naukari ke liye kol aati he
 Shah Rukh Khan says that he can do everything well
 lekin agle hi pal shahrukh khan yah sunakar chaunk jate hai ki yah kisi film ke liye nahin, balki intelligence agency ke liye he
 Posting this video, Shah Rukh Khan wrote, "it has left many questions with itself
 adhik jaankaree ke liye jude rahen
 "let us know that Shah Rukh Khan is working on two Netflix projects away from films these days
 darasal, unka production house netflix kii do web siries taiyaar kar rahaa he
 One of them is the horror series 'betaal' and the other is Emraan Hashmi's thriller 'bard of Blood'

 The issue of forming a government in the state is stuck due to no party getting a clear majority in the Karnataka Assembly elections
 ab sarkaar ko lekar ahm faisla rajyapal ko karnaa he or rajyapal ke paas kai vikalp hai, jiske aadhaar par pradesh main sarkaar banaai jaaegi
 In such a situation, you know what rights the governor has
 
 
 - bataa den kisi bhi pradesh kaa ek hi rajyapal hota he, lekin ek shaks do rajyon kaa rajyapal niyukt ho saktaa he
 The Governor cannot be a member of the Parliament or the Legislative Assembly and is given many powers
 jiske anusaar use giraftaar karne ke liye bhi alag praavdhaan hota he
 - The powers of the governor are divided on the basis of executive, legislative, judicial and emergency
 rajyapal mukhyamantri samet kai ucch pad par niyukti karata he
 The position of the Governor is the same as that of the President in the country
 manto ne samaaj ko alag tarah se dekha, kahe jate the afasaanon ke ustad- rajyapal sunishchit karata he ki vaarshik vittiya vivaran(rajya vajet) ko rajya vidhanmandal ke saamne rakhaa jaae
 Money Bills can be introduced in the Legislative Assembly only after the prior permission of the Governor
 uski sahmati ke bina kisi anudaan kii maang nahin kii ja sakati
 He constitutes the Finance Commission to review the financial status of panchayats and municipalities every five years
 - rajyapal kisi doshi kii sajaa main badlaav yaa faisle par roak laga saktaa he
 The Governor, in his discretion, acts without the advice of ministers in certain situations
 - saath hi rajyapal ko vidhansabha main sandesh bhejne, sambodhan dene sambandhit wo sabhi adhikaar hote hai, jo ki ek raashtrapati ko sansad ke liye hote hai
 Jayanti: Learn - these things related to Motilal Nehru
 
 - Bills passed in any assembly cannot become law without the consent of the Governor
 haalanki mani bill ke alaava rajyapal sabhi bill ko waapas bhej saktaa he
 - When no party gets a majority in the assembly, the governor exercises the privilege to elect the chief minister
 vahiin apatkaal ke vakt vah raashtrapati ke bihalf par raashtrapati kanoon lagu karata he

 rashtriya jaanch agency yani enie dilli hoicourt visphot kii jimmedaari lene vaale i-mail bhejne ke aarope main giraftaar kiye gaye teenon aropiyon ko dilli lekar ai, jahaan unase gahan poochtacha kiye jane kii sambhaavna he
 The NIA team led by Deputy Inspector General Mukesh Singh brought all the three accused - Shariq Ahmed, Abid Hussain and Aamir Abbas Dev - to the national capital and are likely to be produced before a magistrate for their further remand
 aadhikarik sutron ne bataaya ki team ke saath jammu-kashmir police ke upmahanireekshak (doda) munish singh bhi hai, jo jaanch main enie kii madad karenge
 Dev was arrested by the NIA on 16 September, who was sent to seven days police custody
 do anya aropiyon- shaarik or hossain ko 13 sitambar ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha or unhen 10 din ke liye police hiraasat main bheja gaya tha
 The three have been taken on transit remand, after which they will be produced before a magistrate in Delhi
 is dauraan enie unase poochtacha or un par vaigyanik pareekshan karne ke liye adaalat kii anumati maangegi
 The investigation came to a halt when Dev retracted from his earlier statement, in which he admitted his role in the terror attack
 sutron ne bataaya ki dev visphot main apni bhoomika ke bare main apane purv ke vistrut bayaan se mukar gaya, jisase police ke liye mushkil khadi ho gai
 Ever since the news came that the Prime Minister was coming to the BJP office where he would address BJP workers, it seemed that everything was normal
 ve aaenge 40 minute tak bolenge, congress ko bhala-bura kahenge
 
 kuch apni baat kahenge, apane kaaryakartaaon kaa dhanyavad karenge, or baat khatm ho jaaegi
 But when the news came that they would hold a press conference, then there was an uproar in the news room
 ek ajeeb tarah kii uttejnaa or josh dikhaai dene laga
 Everyone started preparing and said that the day we have been waiting for the last five years has finally come
 
 
 sabhi patrkaar apane-apane sawaalon ke saath taiyaari kar rahe the ki yah puuchhuunga or yadi kisi ne mere vaala sawaal puch liya to main ye doosraa vaala sawaal puch luungaa
 The Prime Minister came and sat down
 
 The BJP president first started speaking and kept speaking continuously for 22 minutes as if speaking in a rally
 phir pradhanmantri ko mike diya gaya or ve 12 minute tak apni baat kehete rahe
 After this, the round of question and answer started
 
 
 sabhi bijepi beet ke patrkaar taiyaar the apane sawaalon ko lekar
 He also started asking when his name was called, but whatever questions were asked to the Prime Minister, he pointed to Amit Shah and was giving the same answer
 pradhanmantri mookadarshak bane hue the
 For about 17 minutes, Amit Shah kept answering the questions that were being asked to the Prime Minister
 pradhanmantri ne bolaa bhi kis par
 
 unke vishay rahe ipel,satta bazaar, chunaav ke dauraan inkaa safal aayojan, chunaav ke dauraan parikshaon kaa thik se ho janaa
 
 ramanavami, ramajaan or easter kaa shantipurna dhang se guzar janaa
 
 
 That is, if you want to find a headline from it, then you will be sweating
 sabase niraash ve patrkaar the, jo vahaan maujuud the
 He felt that what happened was that the Prime Minister should not have had a press conference
 soshal media par pradhanmantri kii is press conference kaa khub majaak bana
 Somebody wrote that the Prime Minister looked like a puffed up wedding who gets angry on anything
 rahul gandhi ne is par chutki lete hua kaha ki shandaar pradhanmantri kaa media ke saamne aana bhi aadhi jang jeetne jaisaa he
 
 agali baar mistar shah aapako ekaadh sawaal kaa jabaab bhi dene kii ijaajat de denge
 Now the question arises that if this is what the Prime Minister had to do, the matter did not work out
 vipaksh kaa yah aarope abhi kaayam rahegaa ki pradhanmantri sawaalon se bachate hai
 After all, what questions does the Prime Minister want to avoid answering in a live press conference? yah bhi sawaal uthegaa ki pradhanmantri ne jin news channelon ko intervyuu diya kya ve sab pryojit the, yaa unke sawaal pehle se tay the
 If not, why avoid questions in the BJP office? There are still questions that have not been asked to the journalists of these TV channels, such as where did the idea of demonetisation come from them
 
 There are many such questions related to Rafael Deal, which have not been answered by the country
 
 People would also like to know why they were seeking votes in the name of nationalism or military rather than the achievements of their last five-year term
 
 And in the end what does the Prime Minister consider Godse? There are other questions that are to be asked from him, but the answer will be found only when he will say something

 ’ The Higher Education Council bill in Gujarat has been approved by the Governor last week
 is council kii sthapana se rajya main sabhi sarkari ucch shiksha sansthaanon par council kaa aadhipaty ho jayega or uniwarsity or kalejon kii swaittata khatm ho jaaegi
 Students allege that this will end democracy in educational institutions and at the same time the level of education in the state will fall further
 chaatrasangh dieso kii netaa remi waghela kaa kahana he ki aam taur par shiksha kii kisi bhi council ke mukhiya shikshaamantri hote hai lekin gujarat main mukhyamantri honge
 Apart from this it will have nominations by IAS and other government
 aise main chaatro dwaara chune hue netaaon or shikshak sanghon ke netaaon kii koi jarurat nahin rah jaaegi
 People involved in education will almost cease interfering with what to teach and how to teach
 ucch shiksha mahaj ek sarkari vibhaag banakar rah jaaegi
 Therefore, it is being opposed
 is bill se kulapatiyon tak kii satta par council kaa aadhipaty hoga
 After the bill was passed in the state assembly last year, it was opposed in many places in the state
 adhyapakon ne or anya kai sanghathanon ne rajyapal se ise manjuuri na dene kii guhaar lagaai thi
 He says that the Governor had assured all the associations that met him that he would take care of it
 yah sabhi sangh rajyapal ke dastakhat karne se kaaphi naaraaz hai
 Teacher and educationist Hemantkumar Shah says that after so many months the governor signed the government without asking the government to reform anything
 yah badi bechaini vaali baat he
 The government and the BJP are silent on this issue, but defend in a tongue-in-cheek that academics will be in this council
 lekin yah bhi utana hi sahi he ki koun shikshavid honge yah faisla bhi sarkaar ke haath main aa jayega or chaatrasangh jaise chunaavon kaa chaatr loktantr khatm ho jayega
 Rimi Vaghela, leader of the Students' Union DSO, says that generally the head of any council of education is the education minister but will be the chief minister in Gujarat
 iske alaava isamen iees or anya sarkaar dwaara manonith honge
 In such a situation, there will be no need for the leaders elected by the students and the leaders of the teachers' unions
 kya padhaayaa jaae or kaise padhaayaa jaae isamen shiksha se jude logon kaa dakhal lagbhag khatm ho jayega
 Higher education will remain as a government department
 isliye iskaa virodh kiya ja rahaa he
 With this bill, the council will dominate the power up to the chancellors
 pichley saal rajya vidhansabha main yah bill paas hone ke baad rajya main kai jagah iskaa virodh hua tha
 The teachers and many other organizations had urged the governor not to approve it
 unka kahana he ki rajyapal ne unase milane vaale sabhi sanghon ko aashwaasan diya tha ki vah is par dhyaan denge
 All of them are very angry with the signing of the Union Governor
 adhyaaapak or shikshavid hemantkumar shah kaa kahana he ki rajyapal ne itane maheenon ke baad kuch bhi sudhaar karne ke liye sarkaar ko kahe bina hi dastakhat kar die
 This is a matter of great discomfort
 sarkaar or bhaajapa is mudde par maun hai lekin dabi jubaan main bachaav karte hai ki shikshavid honge is council main
 But it is equally true that the decision of who will be academics will also come in the hands of the government and elections like student union will end student democracy

 In the Ramayana, the context of bringing back the life of Sanjeevani Booti Laxman and lifting the Sanjeevani mountain of Hanuman is well known

 Shani Dev remains calm by worshiping Hanumanji
 
 
 rumassala parvat ke naam se janaa jaataa he yeyah charchit pahaad srilanka ke paas rumassala parvat ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 One of the beautiful places of Sri Lanka, Unavatana Beach is near this mountain
 srilanka ke dakshin samudri kinare par kai aisi jagahen hai, jinke bare main kaha jaataa he ki vahaan hanuman ke laae pahaad ke gire tukade hai

 yahaan ke ped-paudhe hai khasis jagah kii khaas baat ye ki jahaan-jahaan ye tukade gire, vahaan-vahaan kii jalwaayu or mitti badal gai
 The plants found in these places are quite different from those found in the rest of Sri Lanka
 rumassala ke baad jo jagah sabase ahm he wo he reetigala
 When Hanuman lifted the whole mountain, when Hanuman lifted the mountain of Sanjeevani and reached Sri Lanka, a piece of it fell in Ritigala

 On Monday, Asaram was brought to Jodhpur's Mathura Das Mathur Hospital for investigation in the case of raping a minor girl
 aspataal main kareeb do ghante tak jaanch karne ke baad unhen waapas central bhej diya gaya
 Doctors and police had to struggle a lot to get Asaram's MRI examined

 railway ke sutron ke mutabik, pashchim railway ke tel maalish or champi ke prastaav ko soshal media main kaaphi zyada haasyaaspad tareeke se liya ja rahaa tha
 Reactions were coming in the way of people and the common man said that there is no place to walk in the train, where will champi and massage
 aam yatri kaa kahana tha pehle train to time se chalaa len phir champi maalish bhi kar len
 The railways were not expecting such a reaction, at the same time the proposal of champi and massage was not taken well in Rail Bhawan in the capital Delhi
 aalaa afasaron kii naaraazgi ko dekhte hue pashchim railway ne aanan-fanan main is prastaav ko khaarij karne kaa faisla kar liya

 According to him, given the potential of Pranab Mukherjee, this post is not worth him

 "the tribals need representation at the highest level," he says
 '' unki beti or kendriya gramin vikaas rajyamantri agaatha sangama bhi is sur main sur milaati hai

 We will follow the UPA decision
 ''upie ke samarthan kii sambhaavna 22 may ko samaapt ho gai jab congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne unase milane se inkaar kar diya
 They have not forgotten that Sangma raised the issue of his foreign origin 13 years ago
 yahaan tak ki mamata banerjee bhi sangama ko maaf karne ke mood main nahin hai, jinhone 2004 main thode samay ke liye unki party main shaamil hone ke baad unhen angootha dikhaa diya tha
 Mamta's choice as the next president is either Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar or former Governor of West Bengal Gopalakrishna Gandhi
 sangama ko pataa he ki bhaajapa ke samarthan ke bina unki daal nahin galegi
 They now place their hopes on the increasing proximity of Jayalalithaa to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi

 They are also trying to form a south-left alliance

 australian team maaikel clark ke bina bharat daure par ai he, lekin uske ballebaajon ne rajkot main ekmaatr tii20 match main acha pradarshan kiya tha
 Australia may have defeated England in odis after their defeat in the Ashes, but it will be very difficult to defeat India in domestic conditions
 australian team rajkot main 200 ran se adhik ke score kaa bachaav nahin kar pai or isliye use ahsaas ho gaya he ki uske liye raah kaaphi kathin hoga
 Yuvraj Singh, who returned to the Indian team, blasted the Australian attack by hitting 77 runs off 35 balls

 The Australian attack lacks an effective spinner and in such a situation, its fast bowlers will have to perform well to make an impact on India's strong batting
 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni apane gendbaajon ko lekar thodaa chintit honge, kyonki tej gendbaaj ishanth sharma or spinner aar aswin tii20 match main prabhaav nahin chhod paye the
 Ashwin, who was reliable for Dhoni, scored 41 runs in two overs in Rajkot while Ishant took 52 runs in four overs
 iske kaaran viraat kohli ko gend saunpny padi thi
 Bhuvneshwar Kumar and r Vinay Kumar, however, performed well with three wickets each
 baayen haath ke spinner ravinder jadeja ne bhi prabhaavshaalee gendbaaji kii
 The good thing for the Indians was that no other Australian batsman, except opener Aaron Finch, could perform well
 australian team apane ballebaajon se ab adhik samay tak krij par tike rahane kii ummid karegi
 He will need big contributions from captain George Bailey and top all-rounder Shane Watson
 watasan australian team ke sabase anbhavi khilaadi hai or yahaan kii paristhitiyon se bhi acchhee tarah waakif he
 If Australia wants to win the series, Watson will have to do well not only in batting but also in bowling

 An example of this is the Japanese film Bullet Train (1975)
 diarector ravi chopra ne is flop film se prerit hokar multistarar da burning train (1980) banaai lekin film kaa hashr apni japani mul film jaisaa hi hua
 Of course the remake may have mixed results, but new and original stories bear witness to their times, and become the hallmark of time-cinema

 APG Abdul Kalam, the former President who made India a missile and nuclear power, was born on this day
 kalam jitne mahaan vaigyanik the, utane hi shant vyakti jinke man main bharat ko viksit raashtra banane kaa sapana palata tha
 Kalam's leadership may have produced the most dangerous and lethal defense missiles in India, but he always appeared to the world as a very simple and easy leader
 kalam kaa vyaktitv puri duniya ke logon ke liye preranaaspad rahaa he
 The better scientists he was, the better humans

 Be it humans or animals
 darasal ye hua ki ek dephence research and deveopment organijeshan (diardio) main unki team building kii suraksha ko lekar charchaa kar rahi thi
 The team suggested that pieces of glass should be placed on the wall of the building
 lekin dow kalam ne team ke is suzav ko thukraa diya or kaha ki agar ham aisa karenge to is diwaar par pakshi nahin baithenge
 How was Kalam's journey? 1
 saal 1962
 Kalam reached the Indian Space Research Center (ISRO) for the first time
 kalam project diarector the jab bharat ne apana swadeshi upgrah prakshepan yaan eselvi-3 banaaya
 Kalam designed the indigenous Guided Missile, which led to missiles like Agni and Prithvi becoming Indian technology
 2
 From 1992 to 1999, Kalam was also the Defense Advisor to the Defense Minister
 jab vaajapeyi sarkaar ne pokharan main dobaaraa newclear test kiya tab kalam ne badi bhoomika nibhaai
 3
 kalam kii aguwai main jameen se hawa main maar karne vaali missile, tanksbhedi missile or reentry experiment launch vehical (rex) par khub kaam hua
 Missiles named Prithvi, Trishul, Akash, Nag were manufactured
 aise bane missile mainsaal 1985, maheenaa sitambar
 Trident testing
 farvari 1988 main prithvi or may 1989 main agni kaa pareekshan kiya gaya
 Subsequently, in 1998, India, along with Russia, started work on making supersonic cruise missiles and brahmos Private Limited was established
 brahmos dharti, aasmaan or samudr kahin se bhi prakshepit kiya ja saktaa he
 After this success, Kalam got the fame of Missile Man
 kalam ko padam vibhushan se sammanit bhi kiya gaya
 These are the achievements of Kalam
 APJ Abdul Kalam was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the Government of India in 1981 and again, the Padma Vibhushan in 1990 and the Bharat Ratna, the country's highest civilian honor in 1997
 istipha rakhte the sathdiardio ke purv chif ne daawa kiya tha ki 'agni' missile ke test ke samay kalam kaaphi nervas the
 Kalam used to carry his resignation with him in those days
 unka kahana tha ki agar kuch bhi galat hua to wo isaki jimmedaari lenge or apana pad chhod denge
 How did he become so great? Once Kalam went to an event
 jab ve vahaan bolne lage to ek bacchee manch par pahunchi or unase poocha, 'aap itane mahaan kaise ban gaye
 When Kalam repeated his question, everyone started laughing
 phir kalam sahab ne bacchee se poocha, 'tum kis class main padhati ho'
 The child replied that in the fourth class
 kalam ne poocha ki tumhaara jivan main kya sapana he? kalam ne jawaab diya ki main singer bananaa chaahati hum
 After this, a round of laughter started
 kalam ne kaha ki unhen nahin pataa ki ve itane mahaan kaise bane
 These are relative terms
 par wo maanate hai kihar kisi kaa ek sapana jarur hona chahie
 Kalam then asked to repeat something with the child, he said that we must have a dream
 hamen lagaataar siikhnaa chahie
 We should work hard hamen lagaataar kaam karnaa chahie or ghabraana nahin chahie
 In the last, Kalam said that if you follow these things in life, victory is sure

 Abdul Kalam had the support of all political parties in the presidential election
 bataa den ki desh ke 11wein raashtrapati kalam ko 1981 main bharat sarkaar ne desh ke sarvocch naagarik sammaan, padam bhushan or phir, 1990 main padam vibhushan or 1997 main bharat ratna se sammanit kiya he
 Kalam is only the third President of the country to receive the Bharat Ratna before his appointment to the highest post of India
 unase pehle yah mukaam sarvapalli radhakrishnan or jakir hossain ne hasil kiya tha
 He died on 27 July 2015

 ''-varun gandhiutar pradesh ke pilibhit se bhaajapa ke ummidavaar kaa upnaam agar kuch or hota, to alpsankhyakon ke khilaaf uski badbadaahat ko kisi rajnatik sanakee kii hadabadi kahkar khaarij kar diya gaya hota
 But 29-year-old Varun has been born with the privilege of that surname, which you can envy and which is a guarantee of forever that he will have a place in the politics of the country
 haalanki apni jaden khandaan kii galat disha main hone ke kaaran varun lambey samay tak haashie par rahe, lekin ab apni baari aane kaa ve puraa anand le rahe hai
 Knowingly or unknowingly, Varun has made himself the latest symbol of Hindutva
 unke kareebi log kehete hai ki varun ek aise yuva kii tarah najar aa rahe hai, jo apane aantarik sangharshon ke saath jujh rahaa he, jo kabhi yah sochakar hairaan hota he ki kya log unke bhadakaau bhaashanon ke liye vastav main unase nafrat karne lagenge, or jo kabhi ek aatmavishvasi vyakti kii tarah apni kahi baat par ad jaataa he or apane vishwaas ke saahas ko rajnatik samajhadaari se upar rakhata he
 But leave this confusion, then Varun has proved to be so clever, who has made his enemy his greatest strength
 shaayad varun ne khud nahin sochaa hoga ki unke bhaashan unhen un surkhiyon main laakar khadaa kar denge, jinaki hasarat unhen hameshaa se thi, or jo hameshaa se unase dur bani rahati thim
 Among the more radical elements of the BJP, Varun Gandhi's name is suddenly being taken with Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 party ke ek varisht netaa ne jab varun se kaha ki unki tulana modi se kii jane lagi he, to is yuva ne turant poocha, ''or mere pita se nahin?'' varun ke is sawaal kaa asar us netaa par pade bina nahin rahaa
 Varun was just three months old when Sanjay Gandhi, who started the politics of Hoodang, died in a plane crash in 1980
 or jab unki 26 saal kii vidhwaa maa menka gandhi apane jamaane main duniya kii sabase shaktishaalee mahila kahi jane vaali indira gandhi se takaraa gai thim tab varun sirf do saal ke the
 Maneka and her son were thrown out of the family she married
 teen saal kii umr main varun apane pehle kanoonee vivaad kaa hissaa ban gaye, jo parivaar kii sampatti se judaa maamla tha
 And now Varun is struggling with the most important controversy of his life
 or ab jabaki elahabaad hoicourt ne unke khilaaf daayar exiar khaarij karne se inkaar kar diya he, to varun ek lambii ladaai ke liye taiyaar ho rahe hai
 Varun has polarized not only the people of Pilibhit, but also the BJP
 pehali baar ummidavaar banaae gaye varun se party ne pehle to apane aapako alag kar liya tha or chunaav ayog ko bataa diya tha ki vah varun ke bayanon se khud ko alag karti he
 In response to the Election Commission notice, the party said that while one party did not know about Varun's statement, the other completely disagreed with the excerpts of the speech shown in the CD, disassociated herself from it and she The party is not opinionated
 bhaashan prasaarit hote hi shahanvaj hossain ne kaha ki, ''varun ko is bhaashan ke liye maafee maangani chahie
 According to party sources, when the controversy arose, Leader of the Opposition LK Advani was quite upset
 ve na to varun ke paksh main the or na is baat ke paksh main the ki varun par is sabake baavjood koi karrwai na ho
 But he became helpless when the RSS strongly supported Varun and Advani was asked to back down
 party ke adhyaksh rajnath singh ne bhi yah kahkar varun kaa samarthan kiya ki varun ko ummidavaar na banane se party ke hindutv ke agenda ko dhakka lagegaa
 One of the reasons for the party's standing with Varun was the stand of the Election Commission
 ayog ne exiar to darj karvaa hi di thi, lekin usne bhaajapa ko varun ko yah kahkar tikat na dene ko kaha ki ''unki ummidavaari kaa samarthan karnaa unki akshamya harkaton ko sweekaar karne ke baraabar mana jayega
 "but experts are skeptical that this advice of the Election Commission can stand the test of law
 kanuunan, ayog kisi ko chunaav ladane ke ayogy tabhi ghoshit kar saktaa he jab vah kisi sakasham adaalat dwaara apradhi sabit ho chukaa ho yaa uske khilaaf doshasiddh ho chukaa ho
 But before the commissioning of the court process, the party advised the party not to make Varun a candidate
 isi tarah ke vishavaman par supreme court ke 1996 ke faisle ke tahat ayog ne 1998 main shivasena pramukh bal thakare ko chunaav ladane ke ayogy ghoshit kar diya tha
 But only when the Supreme Court gave its verdict
 is tarah kii karrwai jan pratinidhitiv kanoon kii dhara-8-e ke tahat kii jaati he or is par antim nirnay ayog kii sifarish par raashtrapati ko karnaa hota he
 When party leaders sought an explanation from Varun Gandhi about his alleged speech in Pilibhit, Varun defended himself by saying that his speeches were defensive, not offensive
 varun ne unhen bataaya ki ve sirf us kshetra ke hinduon ke bhay ko dur karne kii koshish kar rahe the, jo peedit mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Pilibhit Lok Sabha constituency consists of five assembly constituencies and three of these five mlas are Muslims
 kshetra ke hindu yah mahasoos karne lage the ki unki koi aawaaj hi nahin he or ve unki aawaaj banane kii koshish kar rahe the
 Varun told party leaders that they were trying to instill confidence in the people of the region that they are not alone
 apane bhaashan main karimullah or majaharulla kaa naam lene or yah kehane ke sawaal par ki 'ye bade daraavne naam hai,' varun ne bhaajapa ke varisht netaaon ko bataaya ki ye aam insaan nahin hai karimullah or majaharulla do vaastavik kirdaar hai, jo is ilaake ke logon ko daraate rahete hai
 It is believed that Varun's mother and former Union Minister Maneka Gandhi had advised her son to stick to the truth before publicly saying anything about the controversy over Varun's speeches
 yani jo kuch unhone kaha he, use sweekaar karen, or jo nahin kaha he use nakaar den
 Maneka attacked the Congress in response to the allegations leveled against Varun
 menka ne kaha ki congress varun ke khilaaf shor isliye machaa rahi he, taaki vah apni 'sikh virdohi harkaton' par pardaa daal sake
 On the question raised on the BJP ticket to Varun, Maneka said that the Congress should be ashamed that the Congress has been giving tickets to the people involved in the anti-sikh riots in which thousands of Sikhs were killed
 pilibhit main sikh matadaata badi sankhya main hai or menka ne yah jataane main bhi kotahi nahin kii ki ve bhi ek sikh parivaar main janmi hai
 Before joining politics, Varun ran a portfolio management company, which advised people about financial investment
 baad main varun ne yah company bech di
 Friends of Varun say that most of Varun's time in his days of learning and learning has been spent outside the country and due to this he is severely cut off from the ground
 england main hero ke alaava varun ne thode samay rishi vaili main or dilli ke british skool main bhi padhai kii he
 He then moved to the London School of Economics, from where he pursued a bachelor's degree in economics and a master's in public policy
 aakhir aisa yuva, jiske saamne ek sunaharaa rajnatik bhavishya he, is tarah kii nafrat or chidchidahat bhari baaten kyon kar rahaa he? pilibhit main varun ne jo bhaashan diya, vah na keval us baat par hamalaa tha, jis par bharat vishwaas karata he, balki vah khud unki party ke siddhanton par bhi hamalaa tha
 But there was no sign of regret here
 balki iske vipareet, kisi khantee netaa kii tarah varun ne apane virodhiyon par aarope lagaaya ki unhone uske bhaashan ke saath herapheri kii he or doharaaya ki use ''ek gandhi hone, ek hindu or ek bhartiya hone par barabari kaa garv he
 But there is no denying that Varun has been on the agenda of fundamentalist Hindutva ever since his candidature for Pilibhit was announced — even his speeches were designed with the intention that his election Let the 1
5 lakh voters of the region become polarized on communal basis
 koi navayuvak jo apni rajnatik pari kii shuruyaat kar rahaa ho, uske liye yah kaaphi chaturaai bhari soch he
 Varun was looking for an idea that would make him look different from the rest, and like his cousin Rahul Gandhi, could be included in the big leaders
 yah vah dharna he, jo varun ko shaayad apni behad mahatvakankshi maa menka gandhi se mili he, jo maanati hai ki parivaar kii viraasat kii vaastavik uttaradhikari sonia gandhi nahin balki ve khud hai or jinke jakhm aaj 27 saal baad bhi hare hi hai
 So he chose another route for his son
 gandhi vanshavali main varun aise pehle shaks hai, jinhone apane hindu hone kii baat par garv jataayaa he
 This is completely different from Rahul Gandhi, who always talks about secularism
 jahiraa taur par varun samaj gaye the ki bhaajapa ke shaktishaalee netritv ke abhaav main or kisi bharosemand naare ke bina unke liye pilibhit ke patibaddh matadaataaon kaa samarthan paanaa bhi aasaan nahin hoga
 They found that the language of the Sangh Parivar was more suitable to their needs and suddenly they became the language of the Kar Sevaks and other such people
 kaha jaataa he ki varun ne apane mitron se kaha ki unhone jo bayaan die, ve gusse main nahin die, balki apane swabhaav main rakshaatmak kism ke the, kyonki desh ke adhikansh ilaakon main bahusankhyak samudaay dar main ji rahaa he
 Varun can be arrested for his 'rude' language and prosecuted, but there is no way that can stop him from contesting elections
 varun ko kanoonee praavdhaanon kii lachar haalat kaa bhi puraa andaaj tha
 In recent times, Varun had quoted a Supreme Court verdict in front of his friends, in which learned judges said that "speeches made during the election campaign, even if they are inflammatory in nature, are literally Should not be taken but should be considered symbolic
 ''haalanki bhaajapa ne tatparta se varun ke bayanon se khud ko alag liya tha, lekin phir party ne us rajya main rajnatik laabh lene ke ganit par vichaar kiya, jisamen usne 13 saal pehle 80 pratishat siten jiti thim or jahaan vah aaj haashie par khadi he
 a section of the party leadership believes that the way to make a comeback to state politics is to revive Hindutva and they were looking for a leader to do the same
 varun kaa asar ab neeche tak pahunch gaya he or kaha jaataa he ki bhaajapa ko 200 se zyada siton se yah anurodh mila he ki party kaa chunaav prachaar karne ke liye varun ko bheja jaae
 In fact, there is a large section of BJP supporters who are liked by the leaders who curse the minorities
 us tabake ke liye varun gandhi raturaat yoddha ban gaye or party se jude ek pramukh sadhu ne to apni sabhaaon main kaha ki 'varun gandhi jaise hinduon kii jarurat he
 'when the discussion on these' utterances' of Varun was going on in the channels, the representative meeting of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was going on in Nagpur
 vahaan maujuud rahe sutron kaa kahana he ki sangh ke varisht adhikariyon ne vahaan anaupchaarik baatcheet main varun kii 'bhashaa' par chintaa jataate hue bhi kaha ki aakhir unhone hinduon ke liye hi yah sab kiya he
 The BJP was trying to revive Hindutva, as evidenced by the fact that there are more than a dozen party candidates in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand who were actively associated with the Ram temple movement
 pichley hafte party ne mandiron ke shahar haridwar se apana ummidavaar badla
 There a religious leader was made a candidate instead of a previously announced candidate
 aisi koshishon ko party netritv ke ek varg or aresas kaa khulaa samarthan is baat kaa ek sanket he ki party apane mul agenda par lautne ke liye puri tarah qamar kas chuki he, chaahe isse jad (you) sareekhe sahyogi dalon ko pareshaani kyon na hoti ho
 But the head of a NDA partner party says, "neither Varun will be able to carry this image for more days, nor will he be able to walk with the BJP for more days
 ''ab chunaav ayog or kanoon varun kaa chaahe jo kare, unhone apana kaam kar liya he
 Varun joined the BJP in February 2004, just before the Lok Sabha elections and he could not contest the last Lok Sabha election because he was less than a year below the minimum age limit of 25 years
 varun ne apane bhaashanon se kanoon kii najaron main khud ko bhale hi giraaya ho, lekin voton ke dhruvikaran ke jariye unhone apni khud kii or apni maa kii raah aasaan kar lee he
 Actually the old Pilibhit Lok Sabha seat, from where his mother has been winning since 1989, K2
 9 lakh se zyada matadaata ab nae parisemen main shahjahanpur seat main mil gaye hai
 Most of these Savarnas are Hindus and Sikhs
 vahiin bahedi vidhansabha seat, jo pehle bareli loksabhaa seat main aati thi, ab pilibhit main jud gai he
 Around 13 in Pilibhit Lok Sabha constituency
 13 lakh matadaata hai, jinamein kareeb ek-chauthai alpsankhyak hai
 Varun's friends say that before joining BJP in 2004, Varun was more eager to join Congress
 congress kii netaa or varun kii tai sonia gandhi tak sanket bhijwaaye gaye the or unki taraf se jawaab bhi aayaa tha ki varun kaa swaagat he
 But this could not happen because Varun wanted the Congress to accept his mother as well
 isse sonia gandhi ne inkaar kar diya
 In such a situation, it is not surprising that Varun's estranged Tai and the rest of the relatives are searching for the reason for Varun's latest love for militant Hindutva
 unki dur kii rishtedaar nayantara sahagal ne varun ke bayanon ko nehru vansh ke lihaaj se ayogy qaraar diya he, to chachere bhai-bahan rahul or priyanka ne bhi, jinke saath varun ke kaaphi samay se baatcheet vaale sambandh nahin hai, apane alag ho chuke chachere bhai ke bare main apni lambii khamoshi tod di
 In this heat and pain of politics, Varun took time to complete his second unpublished book of poems
 vah apane rajnatik virodhiyon ko jitani saralata se pahchaan lete hai, utani hi saralata se vah japani lekhak haruki muraakami kii kritiyon par charchaa kar lete hai or apane mitron ko chimamanda ngoji adishi kii sabase nai pustak-hof of yelo san-padhane kii salaah bhi dete hai
 If Varun writes autobiography instead of poems, then obviously his tumultuous life story will be sold out

 vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki al kaayda sargana osama bin laden ke pakistan main maare jane ke baad islamabad bhale hi benakaab ho gaya ho, lekin america upmahadweep main bharat or pakistan ke bich ek jatil santulan banaae rakhega
 Reva Bhalla, who is associated with Stratfor, a strategic thinktank, said, "the US campaign against Osama bin Laden was kept confidential from the Pakistanis so that the campaign would not fail
" kyonki america iske pehle kai baar pakistani khufia ke kaaran is mahatvapurn shikaar ko paane se chook gaya tha
 "bhalla said that but Pakistan knows very well and the US hesitantly accepts that Pakistanis have significant secret contacts with al Qaeda and Taliban-related terrorists
 aatankwaad ke khilaaf yuddh main america kii safalataa kaa str isi se nirdhaarit hota he
 Bhalla has said, "it is a fact that America has to have relations with Pakistan and Pakistan uses those secret contacts for significant gains in relations with Washington
" " bhalla ne kaha, "yah koi myne nahin rakhata ki jihadi khatre se nipatane main pakistani kapat se america kitna pareshaan hota he
 The US cannot ignore the fact that it needs to depend on Pakistan to build political understanding with the Taliban to get out of the Afghanistan war
 " bhalla ne kaha, "isliye america upmahadweep main bharat or pakistan ke bich ek jatil santulan lagaataar banaae rakhega
 But the truth is that the deep mistrust between Washington and Islamabad is no longer hidden at all

 Doronsooro said that there is no indication that any other jihadi organization would be affected by Laden's death
 jaise ki pakistan sthit lashkar-e-taiyaba, jise 26 navambar, 2008 ko mumbai main hue aatankwaadi hamale ke liye bharat ne jimmedaar tehraaya he
 Doronsoro said, but this shocking action inside Pakistan exposes Islamabad's incompetence or collusion which gives the White House a chance to pressure Pakistan to take positive steps

 (input bhashaa se bhi) (also from input language) video-2019 kaa semifinal: mahagathbandhan kii pahal Even when Sachin Tendulkar was awarded the Bharat Ratna, there was controversy as to why Dhyanchand, a hockey wizard, was sidelined for this honor? Did Manmohan Singh decide to give Sachin the greatest honor of the country for political gains
 is puure maamle main ajtak ne ek bada khulaasa kiya he
 When Sachin was being given the Bharat Ratna, many veterans had raised the question that Dhyanchand was the first officer as the player for the country's highest honor
 ajtak ko mili dastavej se saaf pataa chalata he ki major dhyanchand or professor sienaar raav ke naamon par sahmati ban jane ke baad achaanak tendulkar kaa naam bharat ratna ke liye bheja gaya, or tab bheja gaya jab desh main vidhansabha ke chunaav hone vaale the
 According to information received from RTI, it is learned that on 16 July 2013, the then Sports Minister Jeetendra Singh wrote a letter to the Prime Minister advocating the award of Bharat Ratna to Major Dhyanchand
 patr vyavhaar se ye bhi saaf ho gaya ki is puraskaar kii sanstuti khud pradhanmantri karte hai, kisi aupchaarikta kii isamen jarurat nahin he
 Internal correspondence also revealed that the award of Bharat Ratna to Dhyanchand would be placed before the Principal Secretary in December 2013, that is, everything seemed fixed
 tabhi jane-maane vaigyanik or yojana ayog ke sadsy kasturi rangan ne 28 sintabar, 2013 ko professor sienaar raav kaa naam bharat ratna ke liye bheja
 It has been written in this internal correspondence that a write-up should be taken on Professor Rao from the Department of Science and Technology and it has also been written that the opinion of the Election Commission be taken
 tatkaaleen piem manmohan singh ke privet secretary ne is aantarik patr vyavhaar main 17 oktober 2013 ko apni noting main likhaa-piem sahamat hai, ab(a) dsti se rhite-ap mangaya jaae
 (b) No objection should be taken from CSE ie Chief Election Commissioner
 (c) iske baad piem kii taraf se aupchaarik sanstuti raashtrapati ko bheji jaaegi
 It was clear from internal correspondence that on 24 October 2013, Professor CNR Rao's name was fixed for Bharat Ratna
 14 november 2013 ke piemo main diarector rajeev topano ke hastakshar vaale ek aantarik patr vyavhaar main ye likhaa gaya ki professor sienaar raav kaa biodata mil gaya he, saath hi isamen chaukaaney vaala ek or naam bharat ratna kii res main aata hua dikhaa
 In this internal correspondence it is written - 'apart from this, the write-up and bio-data on MP Sachin Tendulkar has been obtained from the Sports Ministry as sought
 piem do draft f / a or f / b jisamen sachin tendulkar or professor sienaar raav ko bharat ratna die jane ko lekar raashtrapati ke nivedan ko sahmati pradaan karen
 These two people do not belong to any state where elections are being held
 isliye chunaav ayog se sahmati lene kii koi jarurat nahin he
 In the internal correspondence, the then pm's private secretary wrote in his noting on 15 November 2013 - "taking utmost care, i have discussed this issue with the Chief Election Commission
 mukhya chunaav ayukta ne apane saathiyon se baatcheet karne ke baad bharosa diya he, ki unki taraf se koi aapatti nahin he
 'after this, in his noting on internal correspondence on November 16, the private secretary has written-' PM has been informed about the Election Commission issue
 unhone raashtrapati ko likhe do patron ko apni manjuuri de di he
 That means the decision to award Bharat Ratna to Tendulkar was taken suddenly
 sawaal uthta he, aakhir kiske dabaav main sachin ko desh kaa sabase bada sammaan diya gaya or major dhyanchand ko darkinar kar unhen sammaan dene kii jaldbaaji kyon kii gai?ajtak ko mili dastavej ke mutabik major dhyanchand ko bharat ratna die jane par sahmati ban gai thi, lekin aanan-fanan main tendulkar ko is sammaan ke liye chun liya gaya
 Former hockey players regret it
 unka kahana he ki pichhali sarkaar ne hockey ke mahaan khilaadi ke saath anyaay kiya tha
 People are left, the fame remains
 hockey ke mahaan khilaadi major dhyanchand bhi dashakon pehle guzar gaye, lekin hockey main unke kirtimanon kii kahaniyaan jivit hai
 That is why Dhyanchand came to our attention when Tendulkar was chosen for the country's highest honor among the players
 artiai kaaryakarta devashish bhattacharya ne jo jaankaree piemo se jutai, usase pichhali sarkaar par sawaal khadey ho gaye
 Now the government has gone, but the question is the same there, and no one has the answer
 purv hockey khilaadi ashok kumaar ke mutabik, 'congress se is baat kaa jawaab dete nahin bana ki dhyanchand par sahmati ban jane ke baad achaanak sachin kaise avatarit hue? lekin khel kii duniya ke log, khaskar puraane hockey khilaadi maanate hai ki major dhyanchand bharat ratna ke pehle adhikari the
 Former hockey players have expressed hope that the new government will end the injustice done to Dhyanchand, he will be given the Bharat Ratna
 dhyanchand ko bharat ratna die jane kii maang pehle se uthati rahi he or cricket ke unmaad se baahar kaa samaaj hameshaa ye maanata he ki bharat ratna par dhyanchand kaa haq sachin se pehle he

 Consciousness of Sai Baba, Chetna Raju says, "we are not outsiders, we have every right to ask questions to the trust, who have done these things without taking anyone into confidence
" '' raju or parivaar ke duusare sadsy nyaasiyon par sandehaaspad samajhaiton kaa aarope lagaate hai or chaahate hai ki prabhaavshaalee shraddhalu nyaas ke galat kaamon kaa pardaafash karva
 Some relatives are trying to capture the legacy of Sai Baba
 in pramukh daavedaaron main sabase aage hai 39 varshiya ratnakar, jo puttaparthi main cabel televijan network chalaate hai or ek petrol pump ke maalik bhi hai
 Challenging him is his personal servant Satyajit, 33, who has been taking care of Baba since 2002
 sambhavit nyaasiyon main sathyajith kaa naam bhi uchhaala gaya he
 Satyajit left Mangalore at the age of five and came to Sathya Sai School
 satya sai institute of hair larning se unhone emb kiya he
 Satyajit had dedicated his life to Sai Baba and no one could enter the Yajur temple without his permission
 keval sathyajith hi the jo apane guru ke pehali manzil sthit nijee kwater main niyamit rup se aayaa-jaaya karte the
 Ratnakar is opposing the inclusion of Satyajit in the trust
 unhen dar he ki sathyajith ke aage unki chamak feeki pad jaaegi
 This nephew of Baba is also looking forward to his political future, in which many activities of Puttaparthi and Trust will prove to be very beneficial

 However, Satyajit wants to stay away from big roles
 iske badale unka puraa dhyaan nai shaikshanik pahal-vidya vahini par kendrit he
 This whole scenario was further complicated when a famous follower of Sathya Sai Baba, Isaac Tigrett, known from the Hard Rock Cafe, claimed that he was the "living will" of the late Sai Baba and that Baba's "instructions" were secret
 They are being met, including a description of Baba's possible heir
 1991 main 30 karod ru
 Tigrett has made notable contributions from giving to setting up of Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Medical Institute at Puttapathy
 haalanki nyaas ne yah kehete hue unke daavon ko khaarij kar diya he ki sai baba kai shraddhaluon se vyaktigat taur par charchaa kiya karte the lekin us baatcheet kaa nyaas ke prashasan se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 If influential devotees of Sai continue, more trustees can come forward to effectively carry out the many initiatives related to the development and welfare of the Trust
 nyaasiyon ko yah andaja to he ki baba ke jivit rahete hue jitna daan mila karata tha shaayad utana dhan-pravaah ab nahin rahegaa, haalanki 25 kilo sone se banane vaali sai kii mahasamadhi ke liye bharpoor daan milane kii sambhaavna he

 The government has sought a report from him on the allegations of financial irregularities on the members of the trust and the controversies going on since Sai Baba's death
 nyaas ke 40 saal ke itihaas main yah pehali baar he jab rajya sarkaar ne iske andruni maamalon main dakhal diya he
 With the Hindu Charity and Religious Donation Act, 1959, it will be much easier for the state to take charge of the trust
 vaise bhi sarkaar ko tirupati mandir kii prabandhan samiti thirumala tirupati devsthanam kii dekharekh kaa safal anubhav he
 Charity Minister Ponnala Lakshmaiya says, "the interference of the government has become extremely important due to differences between the members of the trust
" nyaas ke vitt, gatividhiyon or yojanaon par vistrut report milane ke baad hi ham tay karenge ki aage kya karnaa he
 However, the government is aware that in the event of its own interference, it may have to face many legal problems
 philhal usne puttaparthi main jari gadabadjhaale se nibatane kaa jimmaa sai baba ke anuyaayiyon par choda hua he jinhen sarkaar ke dakhal kii naubat ko taalna he
 There is no answer to these questions
 Why is he refusing to make the list of resources under the control of Sathya Sai Nyas and his price public? Why did it take so long to keep an account of the wealth hidden in the Yajur temple Why did the trust list the goods in the absence of officials of the state government's revenue department, whose presence is mandatory

 He had said that the BJP will lose the elections with a difference of one to three lakhs in all the seats except the three seats in the sixth and seventh phase

 Sharad Yadav, former national president of Janata Dal United, will again get a Rajya Sabha ticket
 ye sawaal he or sawaal laazmi bhi he
 When Sharad Yadav lost the Lok Sabha elections, the party sent him to the Rajya Sabha but this time he is not the president of the party
 party adhyaksh ke kaarykaal ke 4 maheene pehle hi unhen pad chhodana padaa, ab bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar party ke rashtriya adhyaksh hai
 Many claimants of Rajya Sabha ticket in JDU are that if the party has to send Sharad Yadav to the Rajya Sabha then why he was asked to leave the post of national president of the party ahead of time
 sharad yadav 1999 se jediu ke rashtriya adhyaksh the
 In 1999, he won the Lok Sabha elections and also became a minister at the Center
 lekin 2004 main wo madhepura se lalu prasad yadav se chunaav haar gaye phir wo rajyasabha chale gaye
 He again won the Lok Sabha elections in 2009
 iske baad saal 2014 main sharad ko phir chunaav main haar mili or ek baar phir rajyasabha pahunch gaye
 But it was a two-year term
 isliye unhen phir 2016 main rajyasabha jane kii jarurat he
 But JDU has the power to send two to Rajya Sabha this time, while the term of its five members from Rajya Sabha is ending, including RCP Singh, who is closest to the Chief Minister, besides KC Tyagi is also in Nitish Kumar's Good Book
 sharad yadav ko lekar suspencesharad yadav agar rashtriya adhyaksh hote to shaayad unhen kisi se poochne kii jarurat nahin hoti, lekin abhi ki paristhiti main unhen jediu ke rashtriya adhyaksh nitish kumaar kii ichha par rahanaa hoga
 Barring the names of the remaining people, these three names are in full swing with the names of RCP Singh, KC Tyagi and Sharad Yadav, Sharad Yadav's brilliant political career
 madhyapradesh main paidaa hue or uttar pradesh ke raste bihar ko apana ghar banaaya or yaheen kii raajnneeti kii
 Sharad Yadav was used to cut Yadav leader Lalu Prasad Yadav
 kai baar isamen jediu ko safalataa bhi mili
 But now Lalu Prasad Yadav is in the grand alliance
 haalanki party ke kuch varisht netaaon kaa maananaa he ki sharad yadav ko tikat nahin mila to massej galat jayega
 Many times Nitish Kumar and Sharad Yadav pair seem to be unbroken because of seeing statements made off the party line, but many times Nitish Kumar had to face problems while Sharad Yadav was the national president
 taaja udaarahan 2014 ke rajyasabha chunaav main hi aisi paristhiti hui ki nitish kumaar ko apni party ke ummidavaaron ko haar se bachaane ke liye lalu prasad yadav se haath milani padi
 While there was talk of Jitanram Manjhi resigning in February 2015, the role of Sharad Yadav is not considered right by many senior JDU leaders
 aakhirkaar maanjhi ne vishwasamat se pehle istipha diya lekin usase pehle nitish kumaar ko raashtrapati bhawan tak vidhayakon kii parade karaani padi
 Many leaders in the party did not agree with Sharad's statement, except in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections when jdu's number was reduced to two
 tab nitish kumaar ne mukhyamantri pad se istipha de diya
 However, the responsibility should have belonged to the party's national president Sharad Yadav
 yahi nahin, sharad yadav ne nitish kumaar ko mukhyamantri pad se istipha na dene ke liye dabaav daalane ke bajaay ye kaha ki ek baar istipha dene ke baad waapas lene kaa koi matlab nahin he
 Jitan Ram Manjhi would not have had a political rise if Nitish Kumar withdrew his decision to resign under the pressure of legislators
 party ko khadaa karne main sharad kii ahm bhoomikaaj bhale hi sharad yadav rashtriya adhyaksh nahin hai, lekin unki raajnneetik upyogita abhi kam nahin hui he, unka anubhav, raajnneetik sooyeeboojh ke sabhi kaayal hai
 JDU can use them to raise its issues in Delhi and especially in Rajya Sabha
 nitish kumaar ko bhi 2019 kii taiyaari ke liye sharad yadav kaa saath chahie, wo nahin chahenge ki bijepi ke khilaaf unka front kisi haal main kamjor ho
 But the question then how will the trio overcome the same two tickets
 ek tark ye aa rahaa he ki nitish kumaar ke rashtriya adhyaksh banane ke baad unhen bihar ke saath-saath puure desh main samay dena padegaa, aise main shaayad wo aaaraseepi singh ko vidhaan parishad kaa sadsy banane kaa man banaae taaki bihar main unki anupasthiti ke dauraan wo bihar kaa kaamkaaj dekhe
 Then KC Tyagi and Sharad Yadav may decide to go to Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha ab karodapatiyon kaa club banataa ja rahaa he
 Elections are going on for many seats in Rajya Sabha and the surprising thing is that the average income of their 63 candidates (87 per cent) is Rs 122 crore

 Many of these millionaires are expected to reach the Rajya Sabha
 samachar agency ieenes ke anusaar, in 63 candidet main se 55 karodpati hai (jinaki kul sampatti 1 karod rupee se zyada he)

 For the Lok Sabha elections 2019, seats have been signed between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in Punjab
 rajya kii 13 loksabhaa siton main akali dal 10 siton par or bhaajapa 3 siton par chunaav ladegi
 bjp's national president Amit Shah made its formal announcement in New Delhi on Thursday
 shah ne kaha ki bhaajapa or uske puraane sahyogi shiromani akali dal loksabhaa chunaav ek saath ladenge
 The position of the seats is the same as it was in the last Lok Sabha election 2014
 isse pehle akali dal ke adhyaksh sukhbir singh badal ne amit shah ke saath mulaakaat kii
 Significantly, in the last Lok Sabha election, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) won 4 seats and BJP won 2 seats
 vahiin vot pratishat kii baat kare to akali dal ko 26
 3 percent and BJP 8
 7 fisadi mat praapt hue the
 The combined vote of these two parties is 35 percent
 aam aadmi party (aap) ko 4 siton par jeet hasil hui thi or uskaa vot fisadi 24
 4th
 vahi congress ko 3 siten or 33
 1% votes were received
 yani, rajya main pichley loksabhaa chunaav main sabase zyada congress kaa mat pratishat rahaa
 Obviously, the state is in a state of triangular fighting
 chunaav jeetne ke liye kya kar rahi he partiyaan?loksabhaa chunaav ko kareeb dekhte hue sari partiyaan votaron ko lubhaane ke liye kuch na kuch kar rahi hai
 The Punjab government, while presenting the budget a few days ago, has cut petrol by Rs 5
 yah faisla, jaahir he, loksabhaa chunaav ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kiya gaya
 The central government and other bjp-ruled state governments had cut rates of petrol and diesel by two and a half rupees in Akbatur, 2018
 lekin punjab sarkaar ne tab daron main koi katautee nahin kii thi, jisase congress par sawaal bhi uthaae gaye the
 But now as the elections close, petrol and diesel price cuts are clear that Captain Amarinder Singh is in the process of helping voters
 udhar, aam aadmi party ne sabhi 13 siton par chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 In which the party has announced the names of 5 candidates
 congress pradesh adhyaksh sunil jakhad ne mishan 13 launch kiya he
 Punjab Congress has demanded former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to contest from Amritsar
 taaki 2017 vidhansabha chunaav kii tarah party kaamyaab ho sake
 On this, the Akali Dal expressed displeasure that "congress Dr
 manmohan singh ko aage kar chunaav jeetna chaahati he”
 The Akali Dal is besieging the Punjab government on the issue of farmer loan waiver and drugs that they have not worked on the issue that Congress has come up with
 gauratlab he ki 2017 vidhansabha chunaav main congress kaa pradarshan kaaphi acha rahaa tha or party ne 77 siton ke saath 38
 Won 50 percent of the vote
 bhaajapa 3 siton ke saath 5
 The vote was reduced to 4% and the Akali Dal won 15 and 25 seats
 2 fisadi vot hi paa saki
 On the other hand, the Aam Aadmi Party won 23 by winning 20 seats
 7 fisadi vot hasil kiye
 At present, the BJP is expecting Modi magic in Punjab and will also have an expectation of anti-incumbency
 jabaki aam aadmi party apni andruni ladaaiyon se bejaar he
 Not only does the Congress have a captain, it can also benefit from the anti-incumbency trend of the Center
 pakistan ke saath bigadate rishton kaa bhi punjab main voting pattern par asar padegaa
 Overall, the battle of ballots in Punjab can have an impact on border bullets

 According to reports reaching the government agencies, on June 27, the army had a confrontation with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China in the lake area where Chinese soldiers attempted to enter the Indian waters
 udhampur sthit sena kii uttari kaman ke pravaktaa karnal es goswami ne ghuspaith ke taaja prayaason ke bare main puche jane par koi jawaab nahin diya or sena ke jansampark adhikari se is babat sampark karne ko kaha
 However, when it was pointed out that he was an army spokesman, there was no response from his side
 jab samvaadadaataaon ne shanivaar ko videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa se ladakh kshetra main chini sainikon kii taraf se ghuspaith kii taaja ghatnaon ke bare main poocha to unhone keval itnaa kaha ki desh kii seemaa kii raksha kar rahe bhartiya jawan seemaa par kisi bhi ghatana kii sthiti main uchit karrwai karne main sakasham honge
 According to sources familiar with the development, the Chinese troops were stopped at the imaginary line in the lake which is believed to be the Line of Actual Control
 sena se aamanaa-saamana hone ke baad chini sainikon ko waapas bhej diya gaya
 During this time, soldiers from both sides claimed their possession over the area by waving banners

 China's jawans are constantly coming from the northern and southern sides of this lake

 However, army personnel with new boats thwarted every Chinese attempt

 These boats are described as good as Chinese ships and are used for reconnaissance and patrolling the area

 The situation on the banks of the lake has always been volatile and in May last year, Indian army personnel have repeatedly stopped Chinese troops after Daulat Beg Oldi (DBO )'s three-week standoff in the Depsang plains
 sutron ne bataaya ki jin kshetron main lagaataar takaraav kii sthiti paidaa hoti he use siri jaap kaha jaataa he jisamen finger-8 ilaaka bhi shaamil he
 China has built the road up to the Finger-4 area
 yah kshetra bhi siri jaap main aata he or elesi ke 5 kilometre andar he

 tippaniyan Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti has also said that whoever is ready to reject the violence and help in the restoration of peace, they should be negotiated to resolve the Kashmir issue
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki yadi algaavvaadi shantipurna samaadhaan chaahate hai to baatcheet kii prakriya main unhen bhi shaamil karne se koi parhez nahin hona chahie
 Mehbooba said there was a need to create a cordial atmosphere for the dialogue and stop instigating violence to the handful of people who are instigating the youth to 'encircle and attack' the security camps

 april main hyderabad main ek yuvak ko apni nau saal kii bhatiji kaa balaatkaar karne kii koshish main giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 One out of every three rape victims in India is a child
 dilli sthit asian centre for human ritis kii haal hi main prakashit report ke mutabik, 2001 se 2011 ke bich bharat main balaatkaar ke maamalon main 336 fisadi kii badhotaree hui he or ek dashak main kul 48,338 maamle darj kiye gaye hai
 According to the National Crime Records Bureau, Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of rapes of children
 iske baad maharashtra, uttar pradesh, andhra pradesh or phir dilli kaa number aata he
 Madhu Kishwar, a human rights advocate and publisher of the feminist mouthpiece Manushi, says, “this is just a glimpse
 bharat main bacchon ke yon utpeeda par koi vishwasaneey aankada maujuud nahin he
 Most rape cases are kept under control due to slander
 ”kya bacchon ke balaatkaari kii koi alag pahchaan hoti he? ames main child and adolcent cycetry clinics or clinical psychology kii professor tathaa pramukh dow
 Manju Mehta says, "the person who sexually harasses children is a completely different creature from other rapists and criminals
" ” unke mutabik jo log bacchon se balaatkaar karte hai, unki maansik dasha dusron se ekadam alag hoti he
 They have an urge towards children
 ve bataati hai, “yah vyaktitv main ek kism kii vikruti he jo manovaigyanik sanrachana main maujuud kuch blike hole se paidaa hoti he or isaki tripti bacchon ke yon shoshan se hi hoti he
 "she says that a permanent characteristic of the personality of such people is inferiority complex within them
 duusare balaatkaariyon or aparaadhiyon se ulat unka vyaktitv aisa hota he ki ve nakaaratmak vyaktitv vaale hote hai—ve apni aalochana ke prati bahut samvedansheel hote hai, atmamugdh hote hai or chaahate hai ki har koi unki haa main haa milaae
 "that is why they are isolated, unable to form equal relationships with adults, and make children a victim of inferiority," says Mehta
 iske liye ve aam taur par ‘doston’ ke saath yojana banaate hai, unke madhyam se aapraadhik gatividhi kaa khaakaa taiyaar karte hai, sanakpurna vyavhaar karne lagate hai, sex or maadak padaarthon ke chakkar main pad jate hai or jindagi main unhen kabhi aparadhbodh nahin hota
 Manoj is a perfect example of such a personality
 bihar ke mujffarpur sthit chikanuta gaanv main 19 april kii raat jab police uski sasuraal pahunchi, to vah apni patni ke saath yon sambandh banane main vyast tha or uske mobile par porn video chal rahaa tha
 He challenged the police and said, "what Manoj are you talking about, i am Sanjay Kumar
 ” usne kaaphi chaalaaki se bachane kii koshish kii, lekin dilli vaali boli se vah pakadaa gaya jab uske munh se ‘oy’ niklaa
 It was easy for Manoj to go missing in a big city like Delhi with his identity amidst poverty
 jis teen manjila imaarat main gudinga rahati thi, vah usee ke basament main 400 ru
 k used to live in a dirty room for rent
 uski jindagi kaarkaane kii garmi, mausami doston, desi sharaab kii botalon, chhitput jhagadon or mobile phone par ashleel video ke ird-gird buni hui thi
 Manoj did not even think that he would ever be caught
 gaanv ke meley main ghoomane-phirane or khaane-pine ke baad ek achche damaad kii tarah vah apane sasuraal waalon ke liye fal or matan lekar aayaa tha
 People who exploit children put a mask of perseverance on their faces in such a way that they easily create their trust in themselves by diverting the attention of others from their secrets and strategies
 bachche aam taur par unke saath khud ko surakshit mahasoos karte hai
 The central place of child sexual abuse is the house where in 90 per cent of the cases, the person who knows the child is guilty of sexual molestation and rape
 aisa bahut kam hota he ki ajanabi aadmi apradhi ho
 Often it comes to light that exploitation occurred while coming home in a school bus or car, and especially with the last child who had to be released
 akasar skool se ghar jate vakt ladakiyon ko kuch ladke raste main car main uthaa lete hai or chalati car main samuhik balaatkaar ko anjaam de diya jaataa he
 In India, rape is very common even within school
 dilli ke psychologist dow
 Jitendra Nagpal says, "the greatest danger to a child is where he gets the most love and love
" aam taur par mata-pita bachche kii baat par yakeen nahin karte
 According to Vidya Reddy, director of the Chennai-based Tulir Center for Prevention and Healing of Child Sexual Abuse, the process is called 'grooming'
 ve bataati hai, “yah ek lambii prakriya hoti he jisamen bachche ko shoshan kii sthiti tak le jane ke liye apradhi puraa dimag lagaataa he
 "he tries to be a part of the child's everyday life, wins her heart by gifting or twisting her, playing with her, shaking her parents
" yah sab kuch sirf shoshan karne ke uddeshy se kiya jaataa he
 Generally such hunters capture lonely children who need love, who have problems in their family or who are not monitored
 ve bataati hai, “isliye jab ghatana ho jaati he, to baccha buree tarah bhram main pad jaataa he, khud ko doshi maanata he or is vajah se akasar chup rahata he
 "in a changing society, this problem gets worse

 Dogra explains, "during our 42 years at AIIMS, we used to have occasional cases of rape of children, but now there have been many cases in which children have serious injuries
 ” ve teen saal pehle kii ek ghatana yaad karte hue bataate hai jisamen yon shoshan ke liye bachche kaa galaa dabaa diya gaya tha or vah ‘suxual aisafiksia’ kaa sandigdh maamla tha
 Dogra says, "such a crime is uncommon in India, although it is common in Western forensic examples
" ” dogra maanate hai ki bacchon ke saath jo nae kism ke aparaadh ho rahe hai, ve ek aise badalte samay kii ore sanket karte hai jahaan saamudayik rishte tabah ho chuke hai or paariwarik ekajutata ko nuksaan pahunchaa he
 He says, "most of such cases come to us from the lower strata of society
 isi tabake ke log shaayad sabase zyada palaayan kar rahe hai, apane parivaar se juda ho rahe hai or yon sukh se vanchit hote ja rahe hai
 "sociologists also tell the story of two different India
 kolkata ke centre for studies in soshal sciensej main samajashastri maanas re kehete hai, “bharat kii nai samruddhi ke bich vyapak garibi ke chalate jo fark paidaa hua he vah desh ke liye sabase zyada khatarnaak he
 "the story of India's economic development has been very bright since the nineties, but the population living below the poverty line in the cities here has also become the highest in the world
 unke mutabik bharat main jati, sambandhon or saamudayikta kii vajah se aitihaasik rup se palaayan kam rahaa he lekin gaanvon main rojgaar ke simat chuke maukon kii vajah se zyada se zyada gramin yuva ab shaharon kii ore bhaag rahe hai

 Cities act as magnets for the poor looking for good opportunities
 ve yahaan aakar shahar kii gaharaaiyon kahin kho jate hai
 Ray says, "the increase in rape cases can be partly attributed to the anger of the urban poor
" bachche or mahilaayein iskaa aasaan shikaar hote hai
 And anyway rape has always been a tool of war
 ”kolkata ke manochikitsak dow
 Anirudh Deb says, "in the case of child rapists, the basic reason is associated with strength
 yah ek aisa shaks hota he jo kamjor he, jiske bheetar kahin gahare asantosh jamaa he, duusare kii bhaavana or haq ke prati uske man main ghor upeksha he or vah khud se gussa he jo duusare par nikalataa he
 "according to him sexual abuse or rape of a child is more a matter of control and power for such people," and such people have always been and are all around us
 ” ve chetavanee dete hai ki apane bacchon ko lekar satark rahen chaahe vah kisi umr ke kisi bhi shaks ke saath kyon na ho
 They say talk to children about safe and unsafe touch, educate them on personal safety, inform them according to age, develop skills and boost self-esteem
