 On Facebook, 'farmer leader-raja Hair' put a video of Rahul Gandhi saying "unfortunate, these brothers are the contenders of our country's PM, they will sell the crop in the factory of medicine, the limit is gone"
 is postako 72 baar share kiya ja chukaa he or dedh hazaar se zyada logon ne dekha he
 On Twitter, the Twitter handle named "sonia hai to commission hai" claimed "setting up pharma factories so that farmers can sell vegetables there" (pharma companies will be set up so that farmers can sell vegetables there)

 In the video, Rahul Gandhi is saying, "we will try our best to solve the problem of your local farmers and put the medicine factory nearby so that you can sell your goods in the medicine factory there
" ”video main hi raily kii taarikh, disambar 01, 2018 or jagah chitaudgarh likhi hui he
 Actually, in the wake of the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly elections, Congress President Rahul Gandhi had come to rally in Chittorgarh

 In this speech, Rahul Gandhi has mentioned neither vegetable nor any crop
 puraa bhaashan agar suna jaae to saaf hota he ki rahul gandhi food processing units or dawaai banane kii factriyon ko kheton ke paas laae jane kii baat karte hai
 In the speech, Rahul Gandhi says that he wants to talk about Chittorgarh
 kisaanon ke liye wo food processing unit kaa jaal bichaane kii baat karte hai or phir dawaai banaanevaali factory ko paas main lagaae jane kii baat karte hai
 After his statement, the crowd who heard him chants his name and shouts
 chitaudgarh ke logon ko rahul gandhi kii baat zaraa bhi atpati nahin lagi kyonki chitaudgarh main opium, ajwayeen, isabgol ugaae jate hai jinka upyog dawaai banane main hota he
 This can be confirmed from here in this news

 The first episode of the show will be aired tonight
 ' There was a long-standing illicit relationship between a married young man and a married woman
 ek din yuvak apni kathith premika ko tajmahal ghumaane ke bahaane agra lekar jaataa he or raste main hi uski galaa retkar berahami se hatya kar detaa he
 The young man murdered his girlfriend because she was now committing infidelity to him
 mritka kaa naam mamata tha or vah dilli ke chhatarpur ilaake kii rahane vaali thi, jabaki aaropee dharmendra sirohi chhatarpur main hi ek security agency chalaata he
 According to the police, Dharmendra and Mamta had known each other for 13 years
 donon kii alag-alag jagah shaadi ho gai lekin iske baad bhi unhone milanaa-julna nahin choda
 Beloved was started to believe infidel Dharmendra, he used to love Mamata very much but for some time she was infidel to him
 usne mamata ko bahut samajhane kii koshish kii lekin vah nahin maani
 Burning in the fire of hate, Dharmendra decided to throw Mamta out of his life
 ghumaane ke bahaane se di mautdharmendra ne mamata ko tajmahal ghumaane kii baat kahi or donon car se tajmahal kii ore ravaanaa ho gaye
 After reaching Secunderabad, the two drank and then furious Dharmendra killed Mamta by throwing her corpse and throwing her body in a nearby drain and escaped from there
 police ne darj kiya apharan kaa kesakai dinon tak jab mamata ghar nahin lauti to uske parijanon ne police main mamata keaphharan kii shikayatdarj karai
 While investigating the case, the Special Staff Team of Delhi Police got a glimpse of it and during the investigation, police arrested Dharmendra
 poochtacha main dharmendra ne apana jurm kabool kar liya
 Families were aware of the illicit relationship; It is noteworthy that both the families were aware of the illicit relationship between Dharmendra and Mamta
 donon ke bachche bhi hai
 Despite the family's opposition, the two did not stop meeting each other
 pashchim bengal main congress ko jhatka laga he
 Two Congress mlas on Wednesday left the party to join the Trinamool Congress
 in vidhayakon ke naam hai- shankar singh or arindam bhattacharji
 With this development, the number of Trinamool mlas in West Bengal has reached 221
 vahiin congress ke vidhayakon kii sankhya ghatakar 36 rah gai he
 Shankar Singh has been considered among the Khanty leaders of the Congress in West Bengal
 unhone ranaghat pashchim vidhansabha seat se teen baar kamyaabi pai
 Bhattacharjee is an MLA from Santipur seat in Nadia district
 bhattacharji pashchim bengal pradesh yuva congress ke adhyaksh rahe hai
 Trinamool Congress MP Abhishek Banerjee welcomed the two mlas into the party
 banerjee ke mutabik aane vaale dinon main or kuch bade naam trinmul main shaamil ho sakate hai
 Meanwhile, President of West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary has said that anyone who is going to Trinamool is doing so for personal gain
 choudhary ne kaha, agar unamem himmat he to pehle congress vidhayak ke taur par istipha den or phir duusari party main shaamil hon
 It should not be forgotten that these are ordinary Congress workers, they risked their lives to make them lawmakers
 ek hi din main teen-teen mantriyon ke intervyuu lenaa aasaan nahin hai- khaaskar tab, jab unase asuvidhajanak sawaal poochne hon
 On Monday, i interviewed three ministers of the Modi government
 lekin mere intervyuu se teenon naaraaz ho gaye
 The very next day after taking oath of the minister, he had to go through some difficult questions
 agar aap unase achche-achche or unke manmutabik sawaal puuchhen to unhen koi diqqat nahin lekin jaise hi sawaal kii dhar tikhi hoti he, unka gussa bhi badhata jaataa he
 First i spoke to JP Nadda, the new Health Minister of the Modi government
 maine unase sidhaa sawaal poocha ki kya aap purv swasthmantri doctor harshavardhan kii tambaakoo virdohi nitiyon ko jari rakhenge to pehle to itnaa kaha ki abhi to mujhe mantralay ko jaanane kaa vakt dijie
 i scolded them in various ways at the policy level, but i could not find a direct answer to my question
 ve kehete rahe ki sarkaar nirantarata main chalati he
 Before asking the question of AIIMS CVO Sanjeev Chaturvedi, the minister went ahead leaving me behind
 ab baat ek or mantri giriraaj singh kii
 At first, they were not ready to talk to us, then as soon as they heard the question, they flared and they followed me forward and back
 sawaal bas itnaa tha ki aapako to abhi tak aapke ghar se baraamad karodon rupee ke maamle main clin chit nahin mili he? or kya apane puraane us bayaan par kaayam hai, jisamen aapane kaha ki agar koi narendra modi kaa virodh karata he to use pakistan bhej dijie
 As soon as the camera went off, the minister grabbed him and said in his ear, what is the problem, why are you after me? On the other hand, some of the ministers also captured our cameraman Vijay Patwal
 beshak hamaare saath koi galat saluk nahin hua or fouran hamen chhod diya gaya, lekin darana to lajimi he
 After this, the new Minister of State, Ramshankar reached Katheria
 janaab ke upar ek nahin balki qareeb do darjan maamle chal rahe hai, jinamein murder kii koshish se lekar jaalsaji ke saath saath danga karwaane tak kaa aarope he
 But the minister said clearly that all these matters are due to the public
 ye sab rajya sarkaar ne raajnneetik sajeesh kii vajah se lagaae hai or kuch hat gaye hai or baaki bhi hat jaaenge
 As soon as the camera was off, he said, "have auspicious things today," jaahir he, aap netaaon or mantriyon ke aage-peeche hon to aap bahut achche or bade hai, lekin jahaan aapane unako sawaalon se gheraa, aapako gherne kaa kaam shuru ho jayega- isamen aapako intervyuu ke baad pyaar se samajhane se lekar qareeb se jakad lene, bahut maddhim lahaze main chuphi dhamkee dene, khulkar upar shikaayat kar dene kii chetavanee dene tak shaamil he or phir bhi agar aap samajhadaar banane se inkaar kar rahe hon to aap khatare main pad sakate hai
 But if you do not take this risk, how can journalists say? loksabhaa chunaav main jediu kii karaari haar kii naitik jimmedaari lete huenithish kumaarake bihar ke mukhyamantri pad se istipha de die jane ke baad is puure saal pradesh main sattadhari dal jediu or vipakshi party bijepi ke bich raajnneetik shah-maat kaa khel jari rahaa

 Nitish resigned from Bihar as Chief Minister on May 17 after taking moral responsibility for his party's defeat after JDU won only two seats out of 40 parliamentary seats in the state

 After taking over as Chief Minister on May 19, Manjhi, with the support of the RJD and the Congress, had easily won a vote of confidence in the Bihar Assembly on May 23

 Calling him Manjhi as the chief minister, the BJP accused Nitish of running the state rule 'remotely' and said Nitish resigned as chief minister in the name of morality but the ability to choose his successor What morality has he maintained by keeping an eye on the vote bank instead

 Nitish, who became the Chief Minister in 2005 after opposing Lalu's party rjd's 'jungle raj', joined hands with Lalu and accused him of reversing his ideology and asked him to explain what compulsion he had
 Forced it to form an alliance with RJD and Congress, which ruled Bihar for 15 years and was known as 'jungle Raj'
 bijepi ne nitish kii party dwaara bhrashtachar or aparaadh ke prati ‘jiro talarence’ kii niti apnaane par uphaas karte hue kaha ki bhrashtachar or aparaadh ko sangrakshan dene vaali argedy ke saath milakar ve kaise apni in nitiyon par kaayam rah paaenge
 The BJP termed Nitish Kumar's 'sampark yatra' from November 13 to be an attempt to woo the public and accused the visit of being a mere visit condemned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 gat 21 agast ko bihar vidhansabha upachunaav main jadyu-rajd-congress ke gathbandhan ko hasil safalataa ko rashtriya str par moort rup dene ke liye apni sampark yatra ke baad nitish janata parivaar ke vibhinn dalon ko ekajute karne ke prayaas main lage or antat: isamen unhen samaajawaadee party pramukh mulaayam singh ke awaas par gat chaar disambar ko sampann ek baithak main jediu, argedy, sapa, indian neshnal lokdal, samaajawaadee janata party or jedies ke vilay ko lekar bani sahmati se safalataa mili
 Jitan Ram Manjhi's disputed lyrics: This year, Nitish has been busy in uniting other parties of the Janata Parivar including his fiercest Lalu against the Narendra Modi-led BJP, while Nitish has been with him on several occasions due to the controversial statements of his successor Jitan Ram Manjhi
 His party JDU had to face a lot of trouble while appearing to share the stage
 gat agast main apana bijli bill chukaane ke liye paanch hajaar rupee ghoose dene kii baat sweekaar karne ke saath mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ke doctoron kaa haath kaatane, sarvanon ko videshi bataane, centre se samuchit sahaayta nahin laa paane par bihar se bane saat kendriya mantriyon ke pravesh nahin karne dene jaise vivaadit bayanon se fajihat jhel rahi jadyu ko apane mukhyamantri aise bayaan dene se parhez karne kii naseehat deni padi
 Later, Manjhi, terming his 'differences' with Nitish, termed him as the 'supreme' leader of JDU and expressed his desire to see him occupy the post of Chief Minister in the state after the Bihar assembly elections of 2015 and his contact visit
 Shared the stage with him in Jehanabad on 25 November

 But do you know about 2G, 3G technology
 isaki shuruyaat kab hui thi
 And what were the changes after his arrival? 2gsekanda janareshan (2ji) technology kii sthapana 1991 main hui thi
 2G technology technology is based on digital signal
 ise sankshep main ham GSM kah sakate hai
 2 After the arrival of this technology, as if there was a revolution in mobile technology
 phoncol ke saath-saath internet kaa majaa yugers uthaa sakate the
 If you want these jobs, then apply before 31 December, the 2G data transfer speed was 236 kbps
 isamen downlod or aplod kii adhiktak speed 64 kbps tak thi
 At the same time, picture messages, text messages and multimedia messages could be sent very comfortably
 lekin video kol, video condorecing or mobile televijan ke maamle main 2ji safal nahin tha
 3G network, which became the reason for front camera, 2G was not successful in terms of video conferencing and mobile television
 jiske baad saal 2009 main 3ji technology ne network kii duniya main halchal machaa kar rakh di
 Its data transfer speed is 21 mbps, which is much more than 2G
 vahiin aplod speed 5
 7 mbps is the same upload speed 5
 7 Mbps hoti he, isane mobile yugers ke liye video kol, video condorecing or mobile televijan ke raste khol diye
 Even today, this 3G feature was shown in advertisements

 Which created panic in the mobile world
 yugers ke liye video kol karnaa aasaan ho gaya tha

 jaane- kitni alag he america main padhai, plan chunakar lete hai admician4gbarawa ke yugers ne abhi 3ji network kaa puraa majaa liya hi nahin tha ki saal 2015 main 4ji janata ke bich aa dhamka
 By the way, this technology is about 5–10 times faster than 3G, which means the internet speed is around 100 Mbps to 1gbps
 jaise-jaise technology advance hoti gai, vaise -vaise smartphone main badlaav aata rahaa
 After 4G, watching TV on a smartphone without buffering, making video calls, downloading movies, software, games has become a chore
 jis tarah aap apane computer se koi file copy karte ho bilkul vaise hi lagegaa
 Before the arrival of 4G, there was a time when you used to sleep by putting a movie on download at night and by the morning wondered whether the download would have taken place and were very happy when it was downloaded
 dekhen- ye hai sabase kamjor password, i LOVE u bhi he list menjane mobile network kii pehali peedi ke bare main
 
 
 Let us tell you, 1G mobile network came before 2G start, which is called the first generation of mobile network

 bataa den ki jammu-kashmir main anuchhed 370 hataane se pehle hi pradhanmantri narendra modi or grih mantri amit shah rajya main rajyapal prashasan ke bheetar ek aisi team taiyaar karne main jute the, jinke jimme is bade faisle ko amal main laane or uske baad paidaa hone vaale halaat se nipatane ke liye gathit kiya gaya tha
 While some senior IAS officers are included in this team, some experienced police officers are also present
 jammu-kashmir main yah team pichley kai maheenon se chif secretary subramanyam swami kii adhyakshata main juty hui thi or governor prashasan ko or majboot banane ke liye kaam kar rahi thi
 That is why Vijay Kumar was appointed as an advisor to Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satyapal Malik
 is team main jammu-kashmir ke rajyapal satyapal malik ke alaava jammu-kashmir ke chif secretary subramanyam, principal secretary rohit or jammu-kashmir police ke nirdeshak dilbagh singh shaamil hai

 The Election Commission has filed an affidavit on the petition of the Congress regarding the Rajya Sabha elections in Gujarat
 chunaav ayog ne do siton par alag- alag chunaav karaane ke apane faisle ko sahi tehraaya
 The affidavit states that it is in accordance with law to conduct separate elections on the seats vacated by Amit Shah and Smriti Irani
 chunaav ayog ne kaha he ki vah 57 saalon se dilli hoicourt or bombai hoicourt ke faislon ke mutabik ye chunaav karaata aayaa he
 The Election Commission has already conducted separate elections for casual vacancies
 jab kisi sadsy kii rajyasabha sadsyta kaa kaarykaal khatm hota he to vah regular vekency hoti he jiske liye ek saath hi chunaav karaayaa jaataa he
 The Election Commission has cited the Delhi High Court's decision in the 2009 Satyapal Malik case in which the High Court said that the casual vacancy will be filled by separate elections
 isse pehle supreme court ne chunaav ayog ko notice jari kiya tha
 Leader of the Gujarat Congress, Opposition Pareshbhai Dhanani, has filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the Election Commission notification issued for the two seats
 amit shah or smriti irani dwaara khaali kii gai siton par ek saath chunaav karaane kii maang kii gai he
 The petition said that holding separate elections on both the seats on the same day is unconstitutional and against the spirit of the Constitution
 gujarat se rajyasabha main khaali hui do siton par paanch july ko chunaav honge
 According to the notification of the Regional Election Commission, Amit Shah got the certificate of winning the Lok Sabha elections on May 23, while Smriti Irani got it on May 24
 isse donon ke chunaav main ek din kaa antar ho gaya
 On this basis, the Commission has considered the two seats of the state separately, but elections will be held on the same day
 aisa hone se ab donon siton par bijepi ko jeet mil jaaegi, kyonki vahaan pratham variyata vot nae sire se tay honge
 If elections were held simultaneously, the Congress would get a seat
 sankhya bal ke hisaab se gujarat main rajyasabha kaa chunaav jeetne ke liye ummidavaar ko 61 vot chahie
 An election on the same ballot will allow a candidate to cast the same vote
 is sthiti main congress ek seat aasaani se nikaal leti kyonki uske paas 71 vidhayak hai
 But according to the Election Commission notification, mlas will vote separately
 aise main unhen do baar vot karne kaa mauka milegaa
 In this way, BJP mlas whose number is more than 100 can vote twice and win both candidates
 isse pehle 9 april ko ramajnmabhumi-babari masjid vivaad main ek or yachika daakhil kii gai thi
 Nirmohi Akhada had filed a fresh petition in the Supreme Court and this petition opposed the plea of the Central Government to give back the additional land acquired in Ayodhya

 On January 8, 2013, when Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) chief Shibu Soren withdrew support from the 28-month-old coalition government led by Arjun Munda, he was simply following the suggestion of his son, Deputy Chief Minister Hemant Soren
 18 sadasyeey jeemem ne hemanth ko jharkhand ke nauven mukhyamantri banane ke congress ke aashwaasan par munda se naata tod liya
 But Hemant needs Shibu more than the Congress, because the presence of the JMM chief's presence only covers all his manipulations
 8 janvari ko jab hemanth ne munda sarkaar se samarthan waapas lene kii ghoshnaa kii to kisi ne tavajjo nahin di, tab unhone vahi ghoshnaa dobaaraa apane pita se karwaai
 But if it is late to form an alternative government, then Governor Syed Ahmed can recommend President's rule
 shibu ne anaupchaarik taur par jo kaman hemanth ko saunpi, vah unke putrmoh kaa pratik he
 Says a JMM leader, "shibu may be adept at stalking, but his biggest weakness is his son
" ’’ unhen hameshaa hi apane beton se lagaav rahaa he, lekin may, 2009 main bade bete durga, jise ve apane uttaradhikari ke rup main taiyaar kar rahe the, ko khone ke baad hemanth ko lekar unki kamajori kuch zyada hi bad gai he
 Hemant wants to get the chief minister's chair at any cost
 unhen ummid he ki rajya ke sheersh karyaalay kii kursi jeemem ke kai netaaon ke bos banane ke unke sapane ko sach kar degi
 Although these leaders do not approve of their patronage
 congress ko aise yuva raas aate hai jo sab kuch paane kii jaldbaaji main hon kyonki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main use rajya main apni sthiti majboot karne ke liye gathbandhan saathi chahie
 The Jharkhand Vikas Morcha led by Babulal Marandi, who was with it in the 2009 assembly elections, has already turned down the offer
 lihaaja, 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main rajya main kuch or siten apni jholii main daalane kii khatir congress jeemem par baaji khel sakati he
 Of the 14 Lok Sabha seats in the state, the Congress has just Ranchi, which is handled by Subodh Kant Sahai
 lekin seat ko bachaae rakhane main subodhakant kii kshamta par congress ke logon ko bharosa nahin he kyonki unke chote bhai sunil unke loksabhaa kshetra ke hi hatiya vidhansabha ke liye june, 2012 main hue up-chunaav main apni jamaanat jabt karvaa chuke hai
 Government is not easy to form in this scattered situation
 jeemem ko 82 sadasyeey house main bahumat ke liye 42 vot chahie, lekin congress or argedy ke vot jodgaye ke baad bhi iske paas chah voton kii kami hogi
 Yes, it can get the votes of six independent mlas but Congress is not ready to join hands with legislators like Enos Ekka and Harinarayan Rai who are caught in disproportionate assets matters
 jeemem ko gita kodaa ke vot kii bhi jarurat hogi jinke pati purv mukhyamantri madhu kodaa jail main band hai
 So all eyes are returning to one person - Shibu Soren
 jharkhand kii raajnneeti ke is kushal khilaadi ko congress kaa khush karne ke liye sab karnaa hoga
 From curbing independent legislators to asking the son not to offend JMM veterans, it would be easy to say a little difficult

 Today is the birth anniversary of Bhimrao Ambedkar, a social reformer and politician
 unhen baba sahib ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 He was the first law minister of independent India and the principal architect of the Indian Constitution
 unhone dalit buddha andolan ko prerit kiya or daliton ke khilaaf saamaajik bhedbhaav ke viruddh abhiyaan chalaaya
 Supported the rights of workers and women
 aaie jaanate hai unke jivan se judi kai baaten
 
 
 Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891, who shaped the constitution of the country
 baba sahib ko bhartiya samvidhan kaa aadharastambh mana jaataa he
 He raised his voice against the prevalence of untouchability, discrimination against Dalits, women and laborers in Hinduism and gave rise to this fight
 ve mahaar jati se taalluk rakhte the, jise hindu dharm main achhut mana jaataa tha
 He had to face many difficulties due to his poor financial condition

 Hence it is called dr
 bhimrao ambedkar ko daliton kaa masihaarthik mushkilon ke saath hi unhen hindu dharm kii kuritiyon ko saamana bhi karnaa padaa or unhone in kuritiyon ko dur karne ke liye hameshaa prayaas kiye
 Then in October 1956, he embraced Buddhism, due to which millions of Dalits also joined him
 unka maananaa tha ki maanav prajati kaa lakshya apni soch main satat sudhaar laana he
 Dr
 ambedkar kii pehali shaadi nau saal kii umr main ramabai se hui
 After Ramabai's death, she married Savita, who belonged to a Brahmin family
 savita ne bhi inke saath hi buddha dharm apana liya tha
 Ambedkar's second wife Savita died in the year 2003
 biaar ambedkar ko aazaadee ke baad samvidhan nirmaan ke liye 29 agast, 1947 ko samvidhan kii praaroop samiti kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 Then after two years, 11 months, 18 days, the constitution was prepared under his chairmanship
 kaha jaataa he ki ve nau bhashaaon ke jaankaar the
 He received several honorary phd degrees from many universities in India and abroad
 inke paas kul 32 digriyaan thim
 In the year 1990, he was posthumously awarded Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor

 After a long struggle, when Ambedkar was convinced that he could not remove caste system and untouchability from Hinduism, he made a historical statement in which he said that i am born a Hindu, but a Hindu will not die
 hindu code bill par virodhazadee ke baad pandit nehru ke mantrimandal main doctor ambedkar kanoon mantri bane or nehru kii pahal par unhone hindu code bill taiyaar kiya, lekin is bill ko lekar bhi unhen jabardast virodh jhelana padaa
 Nehru himself was then seen bowing to the increasing pressure on this issue inside and outside his party

 Although the Hindu Code Bill was later passed and it also revolutionized the status of Hindu women, it was flexible in many respects with Ambedkar's bill

 But during the investigation of Punjab Medical Council, it was found that the colleges are easily defying the system by bringing doctors from outside on the day of examination

 One such example is that of Dr
 Kulwant Singh, who was shown as a faculty member of MM Medical College in Solan from 2013 to 2015
 lekin vah vahaan se kareeb 150 kilometre dur ludhiana main ek heart centre chalaate hue paae gaye

 uske baad ham ek tivi intervyuu ke liye unase milanaa chaahe, jisase unhone manaa kar diya
 Dr
 Singh told us that he had taught at Solan's college, but he resigned in January 2015, exactly the month the investigation took place

 aaj wo ek chalata-phirata institute ban chuke hai

 ol india radio ne riject kii thi aawaaj, man ko kiya majbootaj se kareeb 4 dashak pehle jab unhone apane kariyar kii shuruyaat kii, tab unki jindagi main sab kuch itnaa bhi aasaan nahin tha
 Today, the voice which has millions of fans in the world, was once rejected by All India Radio and filmmakers
 uske baad bollywood main bhi unhone haar nahin maani or sangharsh jari rakhaa
 Time taught the relationship of relationships Amitabh Bachchan is the only actor who knows how to value his relationships
 bure vakt main unke banaae rishte hi kaam aae
 People from outside his friends in Bollywood also helped him to get out of this trouble

 In this film made for children struggling with progeria disorder, he was equally comfortable in acting by getting his own son in the role of father
 apane kaam se gadhi chhaviengri yangamain se lekar koun banegaa karodpati sho host karne tak unki image logon par chhap chhod gai
 This is reflected in his films as well
 har role ko unhone is tarah se jiya maano wo role unke liye hi gadha gaya he
 Then be it the role of Aishwarya Rai's father in Mohabbatein or Jai's character in Sholay, he molds himself in every character

 bijepi ne gorakhpur se pichley 28 saalon main pehali baar math ke baahar kisi ko tikat diya he

 As a third front, the efforts of the Left parties to form a non-congress, non-bjp alternative with all the regional parties are back on track
 dilachasp baat yah he ki sipiem aam aadmi party ko bhi is morche main shaamil karnaa chaahati he
 According to CPM General Secretary Prakash Karat, 11 teams will meet in Delhi in this regard next week
 25 farvari ko is nae morche ke naam or vijan kaa bhi elaan kar diya jayega
 It will comprise 11 political parties
 sipiem mahasachiv is morche main arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party ko bhi shaamil karnaa chaahate hai
 Karat said that if the Aam Aadmi Party shows interest, then it too can find a place in this political alliance
 agar aisa hota he to kabhi sipiem ke abhedya durg rahe pashchim bengal main manjar kaaphi dilachasp ho jayega
 Because here Mamata Banerjee of the Trinamool Congress, the anti-cpm leader, is running the government and Anna Hazare, once the political guru of Arvind Kejriwal, has announced to campaign in his favor
 magar dilli ke baahar nahin AAP kaa asarangreji akhbaar indian express main chhapi khabar ke mutabik aam aadmi party ke sandarbh main baat karte hue prakaash karaat ne kaha ki ham unhen ek gaiyr congressi, gaiyr bijepi party maanate hai
 But it is difficult that this party, which has achieved great success in Delhi, only considers itself pure and politically honest
 prakaash ne kaha ki aam aadmi party dilli kendrit he
 i do not think it will have any effect at the national level
 sipiem mahasachiv ke mutabik jin muddon par aam aadmi party mukhar he, unke bare main desh ke vam dal kaaphi pehle se aawaaj uthaa rahe hai
 Who will be the talk of the parties in this third front, the Communist Party of India (CPI) and the Communist Party of Marxist (CPM) will be the axis of this new front
 iske alaava is morch main haal main left se tamilnadu main gathbandhan karne vaali jayalalita kii ediemke, uttar pradesh main sattarudh samaajawaadee party, bihar main shashan kar rahi janata dal united, urisa main sarkaar chalaa rahi naveen patnayak kaa biju janata dal, karnataka kii jedies, left gathbandhan kaa hissaa forward block, assam gana parishad or babu laal marandi kaa jharkhand vikaas morcha shaamil ho sakate hai
 At present, there are 90 seats in the Lok Sabha
 In this case, the parties of this potential front have 90 Lok Sabha seats
 kya yah morcha puure desh main siton kaa talmail bhi karegaa
 Prakash Karat did not give a direct answer to this question
 unhone kaha ki is morche kaa charitra sangheey he
 There are mostly regional political parties, which have more mass base in a particular region
 hamaara makasad in sabhi ko saath laakar rashtriya str par ek vikalp muhaiyaa karana he

 input: IANS In Uttar Pradesh, what did the Congress claim about the Brahmin caste, that now the caste disease is going on indoors within the party cadre
 congress party ne shila dikshit ke naam or chehre ko lekar 'brahman mukhyamantri' kaa card khelaa to ab sambhavit ummidavaar bhi apane ilaakon main 'brahman ummidavaar' kaa paracham lahraane lage hai
 This myth of the party which has been claiming itself to be a political party without caste and creed, has started breaking before the Uttar Pradesh elections
 congress kaa 'brahman ummidavaar' kaa aisa poster shaayad hi kabhi kisi chunaav main kahin dikhaa ho lekin uttar pradesh main aise postaron kii bharmaar he
 Not only is Sheila Dixit being openly written as a Brahmin candidate in big posters, but many local leaders are proudly writing themselves as Brahmin candidates and putting big posters on the square-intersections
 haalanki ye poster party kii ore adhikrut poster nahin he
 Congress, which became a Brahmin caste party, is full of such posters of Congress in the city of Ballia in the eastern part of the country, it seems that once it is seen that the Congress has become a Brahmin caste party rather than the largest political party in the country
 in postaron me mukhyamantri se lekar ummidavaar tak apane-apane brahman hone kaa bhi khuleam pradarshan kar rahe hai
 There are also such symbols as tilak on the forehead, a garland of Rudraksha in the neck, which are telling that the Congress is using the Brahmin card indiscriminately in this election
 congress se nahin thi aisi ummidashila dikshit ko aage karte vaktcongress haikamanake dimag main yahi baat thi ki party ko agar upi main khadaa karnaa he to brahman card ke aadhaar par vot jutaney honge
 This is the reason why the cadre of the party is now openly displaying it
 party ko isse kitna phayda hoga ye kahana to philhal mushkil he lekin isse nuksaan kii ashanka jarur bani hui he kyonki jati card ke aise istemaal kii ummid congress jaisi party se kisi ko nahin thi

 unhone kaha ki agar rajeev gandhi doorgaami soch nahin rakhte or is disha main prayaas nahin hote to nadi kii haalat or bhi badtar ho sakati thi
