 Receiving a gift from a loved one can certainly bring happiness but many gifts can increase your tax liability
 sabhi uphaaron par kar chhot nahin he
 Naveen Wadhwa, the taxman's DGM, says, "if the gift received during a year exceeds the limit of Rs
 50,000, the additional amount is to be included in the total income under 'income from other sources'"
 is aay par saamaanya rup se lagu slab daron par kar lagaaya jaataa he
 "it is important to remember that if this applies to the total amount received — if the total amount of gifts received during a financial year exceeds the limit of Rs
 50,000, then this additional amount is not tax free
 haalanki, sabhi uphaar is tareeke se kar yogya nahin hote
 Gifts that are outside the purview of tax take some special occasions for example wedding, in which the gift received is considered non-taxable
 isi tarah, vasiyat ke madhyam se yaa viraasat ke rup main praapt kisi bhi raashi ko kar se chhot di gai he
 Additionally, a person who feels himself to be on the verge of death and settles his property by offering it to someone — he is also exempt from taxes
 in maamalon ke alaava, sthaneey adhikariyon se praapt uphaaron ko bhi chhot di gai he
 Wadhwa says, "exemption from tax from any fund, institution, university, hospital or other medical institution or any trust or institution mentioned in section 10AA (23C), or from trust registered under section 12AA Is received
 ''rishtedaari main mili uphaar kab hote hai karmuktakar sambandhi jatiltaayen jo sabase adhik myne rakhti hai ve hai nikat sambandhiyon se praapt uphaar kyonki ye aksar badi maatra ke hote hai
 Gifts received from some 'close relatives' are completely exempt — these relatives include parents, children, siblings, and spouses' parents and siblings
 isamen ek kareebi rishtedaar kaa jeevanasathi bhi shaamil he
 Gifts received from relatives other than these relatives are not exempt from tax — for example, gifts received from cousins do not fall under the tax exemption
 yah bhi dhyaan rakhana mahatvapurn he ki praapt uphaaron se arjeet aay kar mukt nahin hoti
 Archit Gupta, founder and CEO of Cleartax, says, "if you receive any income from a gift — such as interest, or other benefits from investment, then you should add such income to your tax return as income from other sources
" 'and pay the tax as per the applicable tax slab
 ''kab or kaise di jaae uphaar kii jaankariyadi aapaki aay mul chhot seemaa se upar he—60 varsh se kam aayu ke logon ke liye 2
 5 lakh rupees - it is mandatory to file income tax returns
 isliye, uphaaron ko aapaki aay ke hisse ke rup main ghoshit kiya janaa chahie, bhale hi yah chhot ke daayre main aate hon haalanki, yadi aapaki aay mul chhot seemaa se kam he to yah anivaary nahin ho saktaa he
 Wadhwa says, "if the assessee (assessee) is not required to file tax returns, then there is no need to furnish details of gifts received during the previous year
 ''haalanki, bhale hi yah anivaary nahin he, phir bhi iskaa khulaasa karnaa behatar hoga
 "you should disclose the value of the gifts while filing your tax return," says Gupta
 kar yogya uphaar ke maamle main, raashi kaa ullekh 'anya sroton' ke tahat kiya janaa he
 Gifts should be disclosed as 'discounted income' in income tax returns

 Fearing profanity in society, the father drank poison on 8 August

 After the father's death, the daughter was shocked

 After his condition is critical, he is admitted to Rohtak PGI Hospital, where his condition remains critical

 The investigation of this case is going on
 party main chal rahi khinchataan ke bich mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kii aguwai main aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne 49 din puure kar liye hai
 In its first term, the AAP government lasted for 49 days
 duusare kaarykaal main sarkaar pichhali baar se bilkul agal andaaz main lag rahi he
 This time the government, which resigned on the issue of 'lokpal', seems dull on 'lokpal' and 'swaraj Bill'
 pehle kaarykaal main 'bhrashtachar ke kilaaf ection' main dikhne vaali sarkaar ne is baar bhrashtachar rokane ke liye koi khaas pahal nahin kii gai he
 The ongoing image within the party has also tarnished the image of the government
 haalanki is dauraan kejariwal sarkaar ne janata ke hit main aadhi dar par bijli dena, har maheene 20,000 litre muft pani dene or dilli dialog kamishan kaa gathan karne samet kai anya faisle liye hai
 The government has also announced compensation of Rs 1 crore for the death of the employees of Delhi Police, Para Military Force or Delhi Government while on duty
 koi vaktaa rohit vemula par bolne lagata to koi jeenyu par
 Someone would initially speak on Rohit and then on JNU and finally on nationalism
 jab tak aap rohit vemula par koi raay banaate doosraa vaktaa uthta or bahes ko jeenyu ke bahaane rashtrawaad or aatankwaad kii disha main le jaataa
 It felt like a swing of thoughts and speeches
 behatar hota ye bahes yaa to puri tarah se jeenyu par hoti yaa rohit vemula par
 It was difficult to understand how Rohit Vemula fit into the debate of nationalism or how nationalism or JNU fit into the debate of Rohit Vemula

 i am talking about the discussion that started in the Lok Sabha

 When the TRS MP saw political visit by leaders after Vemula's suicide at Hyderabad University, the Trinamool MP did not stop targeting the CPM while speaking on Vemula and JNU
 yahi is bahes kii khubi thi or yahi khubi sarkaar ke liye aasaan bani
 Speakers of Congress and BJP were confronting each other
 vaktaa jab hindi main bol rahe the tab unke tevar josh bhare or naatakeey lage
 Speeches of speech change in English

 Now i would like to mention two Dalit leaders today
 ek kaa sambandh loksabhaa kii bahes se he or duusare kaa sambandh rajyasabha se he, magar rohit vemula se jude hone ke kaaran praasangik he
 First i want to talk about Lok Janshakti Party leader Chirag Paswan who rose to speak on Rohit Vemula
 chiraag ne kaha ki rohit vemula ke saath jo kuch bhi hua use koi sahi nahin tehra saktaa
 Can anyone ease their mother's pain
 agar is mudde ko gambhirtha se handle kiya jaataa to aaj nateeja kuch or hota yah kehete hue chiraag paswan ne centre sarkaar kii tarif bhi kar di ki sarkaar ne turant jaanch kii ghoshnaa kar acha kaam kiya
 Now it could not be clear from their point that they are seeking an answer from the government or giving a certificate to it
 chiraag ne ek do baar zikr kiya ki ve samaaj kii vichaar yatra ke is mode se vyathit or chakit hai
 His talk felt that the country's Dalit politics is changing or Dalit politicians are changing
 chiraag us zamin se baat kar rahe the jahaan se ab ve jaat paat dharm kshetra se upar uthakar masalon ko dekhnaa chaahate hai
 The Rohit Vemula issue, which Ambedkarite students were pursuing by making it a Dalit issue, did not impress Chirag
 is maamle main mujhe chiraag kaa bhaashan saahasik laga
 By the way i liked Chirag's suit
 taai kaa note bhi
 Attention was sometimes going to his talk and sometimes to his suit
 bees saal pehle agar yahi mudda hota to unke pita ramvilas paswan kaise bolte
 They were aggressive or spiritual like a lamp
 lekin kya chiraag ko apane pita se swatantra hokar unheen sawaalon ko nae sire se dekhne kaa haq nahin he
 What should not be seen aise kaise ho saktaa he
 Chirag may not have fought like his father, but Mayawati has come from the politics of struggle
 rajyasabha main mayawati ne kendriya mantri smriti irani se poocha ki rohit vemula maamle kii jaanch kii cameti main ek bhi dalit kyon nahin he
 Initially, Mayawati showed aggression, then in response, the way Smriti Irani dominated, she would have rarely happened to Mayawati within the House
 mayawati par raajnneetik hamale hue hai magar hamalaa karte virdohi bhi khyaal rakhte the ki kahin mayawati ke peeche khadaa dalit matadaata aahat na ho jaae
 Mayawati has also had the benefit of being a Dalit leader, but Smriti Irani was stunned by the aggressive attitude with which she responded with a request to respond politely
 smriti irani ke chehre par gussa tha or jawaab saaf saaf ki mayawati ji mujhase jawaab chaahati hai to jawaab dene ke liye taiyaar hum
 i tell every BSP leader and worker that i will put my head in your feet if i am not satisfied with my answer
 maine aapke liye irani ke bayaan kaa kuch hi hissaa padhaa he lekin unka gussa bijepi ko is majaburi se bhi mukt karata he ki wo upi chunaav main in charchaaon ke saath ab nahin utregi ki zarurat padi to sarkaar banane ke liye bispi kii madad lee jaaegi yaa bispi ko samarthan degi
 Anyway, the BJP had pushed the BSP to zero in the Lok Sabha elections
 smriti irani ne kaha ki koi naagarik tabhi dalit he jise mayawati pramanit karengi
 They are ready to debate on this
 vipaksh ke bhaashanon main jis tarah kii aakraamakata, bhavukta or nirbhikta argedy se nilambit pappu yadav or argedy ke saansad jaiprakash yadav ke bhaashanon main thi, utani congress or vipaksh ke anya netaaon main nazar nahin ai

 The question is how the opposition in the Lok Sabha faced the question of Afzal Guru and Kashmir
 bharat virdohi naaron kii ninda to sabane kii lekin afzal guru par vipaksh kii taraf se kisi ne apni taraf se paksh nahin rakhaa
 They either survived or remained here and there
 bijepi ke netaa afzal guru par tike rahe or vipaksh ko gherte rahe
 The two leaders attempted to confront the question of Afzal Guru
 tirupati se wiesar ke saansad reddy ne kaha ki jab jeenyu ke chaatr jammu kashmir se sahanubhuti main poster lagaate hai, afzal guru ke samarthan main nahin
 You go into history aap baar baar unhen dhokhaa dete hai
 You said about the referendum, did not
 vishvavidhyalay main kuch baaten kahi jaati hai
 Students have rights but why does the government respond
 ab ye paryaapt daleel thi yaa nahin aap tay karen
 From Hyderabad, Asaduddin Owaisi looked a bit more assertive
 ovaisi ne kaha ki 1984 main punjab ke mukhyamantri ne samvidhan jalaayaa, aap unki tarif kar rahe hai
 You are talking about Afzal
 jo naare jeenyu main lage main use nahin maanata
 But slogans are raised daily in Srinagar
 kya puure srinagar ko band kar denge
 Why are you praising the PDP? kahaan gaya aapkaa deshprem
 When the PDP called Afzal Guru a martyr
 ovaisi ne congress kii bhi aalochana kii
 If the PDP had spoken on Afzal Guru's question, something would have been clear
 is bahes main pidipi ne hissaa hi nahin liya
 Rahul Gandhi had said on Wednesday morning that the BJP would not let him speak but he did not speak
 unka na bolnaa bhi ek sawaal kii tarah gunj rahaa he
 The comments vaise aaj kii prastaavna smriti irani ke bhaashan par hi honi chahie thi jo unhone loksabhaa main diya
 Apart from aggressiveness, sentimentalism, theatricality, she came all prepared according to her calculations
 unka jawaab tab tak sab par baari hi kaha jayega jab tak vipaksh kii taraf se koi binduvaar jawaab nahin detaa
 The opportunity has been lost in the Lok Sabha because the debate has been completed there
 apane bhaashanon main naatakeeyata or bhatakane kii chhot vipakshi netaaon ne bhi lee or smriti irani ne bhi lee
 Therefore, the opposition cannot complain about it
 bhaashanon ko sunakar laga ki vipakshi kheme main pratibhashali vaktaa or khaskar mehnatee vaktaaon kaa akaal he
 None of them gave an impressive speech like Smriti Irani

 The Home Minister said that there can be a debate on whether or not to be accused of treason, but the police investigation will be tested in the court

 But whether the questions which were being raised outside also arose properly within the House, answers were sought and answers were given
 kya nai baat hui yaa unheen baton ko on ricard kehane kii aupchaarikta puri kii gai
 Who was escaping and who was asking in front or answering
 ab main aaj do dalit netaaon kaa zikr karnaa chaahunga
 One is related to the Lok Sabha debate and the other is to the Rajya Sabha, but Rohit is relevant due to his association with Vemula
 pehle lokjanshkti party ke netaa chiraag paswan kii baat karnaa chahta hum jo rohit vemula par bolne ke liye uthe
 Chirag said that no one can justify whatever happened to Rohit Vemula
 kya koi unki maa kaa dard kam kar saktaa he
 Had the issue been handled seriously, Chirag Paswan also praised the central government, saying that the result would have been different had the government done a good job by announcing the inquiry immediately
 ab unki baat se saaf nahin ho sakaa ki ve sarkaar se jawaab maang rahe hai yaa use certificate de rahe hai
 Chirag mentioned twice that he is distressed and amazed by this turn of the society's thought journey
 unki baton se laga ki desh kii dalit raajnneeti badal rahi he yaa phir dalit rajaneta badal rahe hai
 Chirag was talking to the land from where he now wants to rise above the caste and religion area and see the issues
 jis rohit vemula ke mudde ko ambedkarwaadi chaatr dalit mudda banaakar aage badha rahe the, chiraag unke asar main nahin aae
 In this case, i found Chirag's speech bold
 vaise chiraag kaa suut mujhe pasand aayaa
 Also a tie knot
 dhyaan kabhi unki baat par ja rahaa tha to kabhi unke suut par
 If this was the issue twenty years ago, how would his father Ram Vilas Paswan speak
 ve aakraamak hote yaa chiraag kii tarah aadhyatmik
 But doesn't Chirag have the right to look at the same questions afresh, independent of his father
 kya dekha hi nahin janaa chahie
 How can this happen? chiraag ne bhale apane pita kii tarah sangharsh nahin kiya ho lekin mayawati to sangharsh kii raajnneeti se ai hai
 In the Rajya Sabha, Mayawati asked Union Minister Smriti Irani why there is not a single Dalit in the committee investigating the Rohit Vemula case
 shuru main mayawati ne aakraamakata dikhaai to jawaab main smriti irani jis tarah se haaavee huin wo sadan ke bheetar mayawati ke saath shaayad hi kabhi hua hoga
 There have been political attacks on Mayawati, but the opponents of the attack also used to take care that Dalit voters standing behind Mayawati should not be hurt
 mayawati ko bhi dalit netaa hone kaa laabh miltaa rahaa he lekin smriti irani ne vinamrata se jawaab dene ke anurodh ke saath jis aakraamak tevar se jawaab diya usase mayawati bhi stabdh rah gayi
 There was anger on Smriti Irani's face and the answer was clearly that if Mayawati ji wants an answer from me, i am ready to answer
 basapa ke har netaa or kaaryakarta se kahati hum ki sar kalam kar aapke charnon main rakh duungi agar mere jawaab se santusht na hon
 i have read only part of Irani's statement for you, but his anger also frees BJP from the compulsion that it will not come down with these discussions in UP elections that bsp's help will be taken to form government if needed
 Will support BSP
 vaise bhi bijepi ne loksabhaa chunaav main bispi ko zero par pahunchaa diya tha
 Smriti Irani said that a citizen is a Dalit only if Mayawati will certify
 wo is par bahes ke liye taiyaar hai
 The kind of aggression, sentimentalism and fearlessness in the speeches of the Opposition was not seen in the speeches of Pappu Yadav, suspended from the RJD and Jayaprakash Yadav, RJD MP
 unke bhaashanon main ye aayaa ki kanhaiya bihar kaa betaa he
 The rest of the accused, where Jahan has sons, could not muster the courage to say that their leader was the son of Bihar
 sawaal he ki loksabhaa main vipaksh ne afzal guru or kashmir ke sawaal kaa kaise saamana kiya
 Everyone slammed the anti-india slogans, but no one from Afzal Guru put his side for opposition
 wo yaa to batch gaye yaa idhar udhar bolkar rah gaye
 BJP leader Afzal remained on the Guru and surrounded the opposition
 do netaaon ne afzal guru ke sawaal kaa saamana karne kaa prayaas kiya
 YSR MP Reddy from Tirupati said that when JNU students put up posters in sympathy with Jammu and Kashmir, not in support of Afzal Guru
 aap itihaas main jaaiye
 You cheat them again and again
 aapane janamatsangrah kii baat kahi thi, nahin kii
 Some things are said in the university
 chaatro ke adhikaar hai lekin sarkaar kyon pratikriya detii he
 Now whether or not this was enough argument, you decide
 hyderabad se hi asaduddin ovaisi thode adhik mukhar nazar aae
 Owaisi said that in 1984 the Chief Minister of Punjab burnt the constitution, you are praising him
 aap afzal kii baat kar rahe hai
 i do not believe the slogan of JNU
 lekin srinagar main rose jume ke din naare lagaaye jate hai
 Will you shut down the entire Srinagar
 pidipi kii tarif aap kyon kar rahe hai
 Where did your patriotism go? jab pidipi ne afzal guru ko shahid qaraar diya
 Owaisi also criticized the Congress
 afzal guru ke sawaal par pidipi bolti to kuch spasht hota
 PDP did not participate in this debate
 rahul gandhi ne buudhvaar subah kaha tha ki bijepi bolne nahin degi lekin wo to bole hi nahin
 Their refusal is also echoing like a question
 tippaniyan Today's introduction should have been on Smriti Irani's speech which she gave in the Lok Sabha
 aakraamakata, bhavukta, naatakeeyata ke alaava wo apane hisaab se puri taiyaari karke ain thim
 His answer will be called heavy on everyone until someone from the opposition gives a point-wise reply
 loksabhaa main to mauka chalaa gaya kyonki vahaan bahes puri ho gai he
 Dramatism and deviation in his speeches were taken by opposition leaders and Smriti Irani
 isliye vipaksh isaki shikaayat nahin kar saktaa
 Hearing the speeches, it was felt that there is a famine of talented speakers and especially hardworking speakers in the opposition camp
 unamem se koi bhi smriti irani ke jaisaa prabhaavshaalee bhaashan nahin de paaya
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh immediately got up and praised Smriti Irani
 grahamantri ne kaha ki deshadroh kaa aarope lage yaa na lage is par bahes ho sakati he magar police kii jaanch kii pariksha adaalat main ho jaaegi
 i have not heard everyone, nor have i been able to mention all the things that i heard here
 lekin kya jo sawaal baahar uth rahe the wo sadan ke bheetar bhi thik se uthe, jawaab maange gaye or jawaab die gaye
 Whether a new thing happened or the formality of saying the same things on record was completed
 koun bachakar nikal rahaa tha or koun saamne saamne se puch rahaa tha yaa jawaab de rahaa tha
 Chirag said that no one can justify whatever happened to Rohit Vemula
 kya koi unki maa kaa dard kam kar saktaa he
 Had the issue been handled seriously, Chirag Paswan also praised the central government, saying that the result would have been different had the government done a good job by announcing the inquiry immediately
 ab unki baat se saaf nahin ho sakaa ki ve sarkaar se jawaab maang rahe hai yaa use certificate de rahe hai

 aapane janamatsangrah kii baat kahi thi, nahin kii
 Some things are said in the university
 chaatro ke adhikaar hai lekin sarkaar kyon pratikriya detii he
 Now whether or not this was enough argument, you decide
 hyderabad se hi asaduddin ovaisi thode adhik mukhar nazar aae
 Owaisi said that in 1984 the Chief Minister of Punjab burnt the constitution, you are praising him
 aap afzal kii baat kar rahe hai
 i do not believe the slogan of JNU
 lekin srinagar main rose jume ke din naare lagaaye jate hai
 Will you shut down the entire Srinagar
 pidipi kii tarif aap kyon kar rahe hai
 Where did your patriotism go? jab pidipi ne afzal guru ko shahid qaraar diya
 Owaisi also criticized the Congress
 afzal guru ke sawaal par pidipi bolti to kuch spasht hota
 PDP did not participate in this debate
 rahul gandhi ne buudhvaar subah kaha tha ki bijepi bolne nahin degi lekin wo to bole hi nahin
 Their refusal is also echoing like a question
 tippaniyan Today's introduction should have been on Smriti Irani's speech which she gave in the Lok Sabha
 aakraamakata, bhavukta, naatakeeyata ke alaava wo apane hisaab se puri taiyaari karke ain thim
 His answer will be called heavy on everyone until someone from the opposition gives a point-wise reply
 loksabhaa main to mauka chalaa gaya kyonki vahaan bahes puri ho gai he
 Dramatism and deviation in his speeches were taken by opposition leaders and Smriti Irani
 isliye vipaksh isaki shikaayat nahin kar saktaa
 Hearing the speeches, it was felt that there is a famine of talented speakers and especially hardworking speakers in the opposition camp
 unamem se koi bhi smriti irani ke jaisaa prabhaavshaalee bhaashan nahin de paaya
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh immediately got up and praised Smriti Irani
 grahamantri ne kaha ki deshadroh kaa aarope lage yaa na lage is par bahes ho sakati he magar police kii jaanch kii pariksha adaalat main ho jaaegi
 i have not heard everyone, nor have i been able to mention all the things that i heard here
 lekin kya jo sawaal baahar uth rahe the wo sadan ke bheetar bhi thik se uthe, jawaab maange gaye or jawaab die gaye
 Whether a new thing happened or the formality of saying the same things on record was completed
 koun bachakar nikal rahaa tha or koun saamne saamne se puch rahaa tha yaa jawaab de rahaa tha
 Chirag may not have fought like his father, but Mayawati has come from the politics of struggle
 rajyasabha main mayawati ne kendriya mantri smriti irani se poocha ki rohit vemula maamle kii jaanch kii cameti main ek bhi dalit kyon nahin he
 Initially, Mayawati showed aggression, then in response, the way Smriti Irani dominated, she would have rarely happened to Mayawati within the House
 mayawati par raajnneetik hamale hue hai magar hamalaa karte virdohi bhi khyaal rakhte the ki kahin mayawati ke peeche khadaa dalit matadaata aahat na ho jaae
 Mayawati has also had the benefit of being a Dalit leader, but Smriti Irani was stunned by the aggressive attitude with which she responded with a request to respond politely
 smriti irani ke chehre par gussa tha or jawaab saaf saaf ki mayawati ji mujhase jawaab chaahati hai to jawaab dene ke liye taiyaar hum
 i tell every BSP leader and worker that i will put my head in your feet if i am not satisfied with my answer
 maine aapke liye irani ke bayaan kaa kuch hi hissaa padhaa he lekin unka gussa bijepi ko is majaburi se bhi mukt karata he ki wo upi chunaav main in charchaaon ke saath ab nahin utregi ki zarurat padi to sarkaar banane ke liye bispi kii madad lee jaaegi yaa bispi ko samarthan degi
 Anyway, the BJP had pushed the BSP to zero in the Lok Sabha elections
 smriti irani ne kaha ki koi naagarik tabhi dalit he jise mayawati pramanit karengi
 They are ready to debate on this
 vipaksh ke bhaashanon main jis tarah kii aakraamakata, bhavukta or nirbhikta argedy se nilambit pappu yadav or argedy ke saansad jaiprakash yadav ke bhaashanon main thi, utani congress or vipaksh ke anya netaaon main nazar nahin ai
 It was in his speeches that Kanhaiya is the son of Bihar
 baaki aaropee jahaan ke bete hai unke netaa bihar kaa betaa jaisaa kehane kii himmat nahin juta paae
 The question is how the opposition in the Lok Sabha faced the question of Afzal Guru and Kashmir
 bharat virdohi naaron kii ninda to sabane kii lekin afzal guru par vipaksh kii taraf se kisi ne apni taraf se paksh nahin rakhaa
 They either survived or remained here and there
 bijepi ke netaa afzal guru par tike rahe or vipaksh ko gherte rahe
 The two leaders attempted to confront the question of Afzal Guru
 tirupati se wiesar ke saansad reddy ne kaha ki jab jeenyu ke chaatr jammu kashmir se sahanubhuti main poster lagaate hai, afzal guru ke samarthan main nahin
 You go into history aap baar baar unhen dhokhaa dete hai
 You said about the referendum, did not
 vishvavidhyalay main kuch baaten kahi jaati hai
 Students have rights but why does the government respond
 ab ye paryaapt daleel thi yaa nahin aap tay karen
 From Hyderabad, Asaduddin Owaisi looked a bit more assertive
 ovaisi ne kaha ki 1984 main punjab ke mukhyamantri ne samvidhan jalaayaa, aap unki tarif kar rahe hai
 You are talking about Afzal
 jo naare jeenyu main lage main use nahin maanata
 But slogans are raised daily in Srinagar
 kya puure srinagar ko band kar denge
 Why are you praising the PDP? kahaan gaya aapkaa deshprem
 When the PDP called Afzal Guru a martyr
 ovaisi ne congress kii bhi aalochana kii
 If the PDP had spoken on Afzal Guru's question, something would have been clear
 is bahes main pidipi ne hissaa hi nahin liya
 Rahul Gandhi had said on Wednesday morning that the BJP would not let him speak but he did not speak
 unka na bolnaa bhi ek sawaal kii tarah gunj rahaa he
 The comments vaise aaj kii prastaavna smriti irani ke bhaashan par hi honi chahie thi jo unhone loksabhaa main diya
 Apart from aggressiveness, sentimentalism, theatricality, she came all prepared according to her calculations
 unka jawaab tab tak sab par baari hi kaha jayega jab tak vipaksh kii taraf se koi binduvaar jawaab nahin detaa
 The opportunity has been lost in the Lok Sabha because the debate has been completed there
 apane bhaashanon main naatakeeyata or bhatakane kii chhot vipakshi netaaon ne bhi lee or smriti irani ne bhi lee
 Therefore, the opposition cannot complain about it
 bhaashanon ko sunakar laga ki vipakshi kheme main pratibhashali vaktaa or khaskar mehnatee vaktaaon kaa akaal he
 None of them gave an impressive speech like Smriti Irani
 grahamantri rajnath singh ne turant uthakar smriti irani kii zordaar prashansa kii
 The Home Minister said that there can be a debate on whether or not to be accused of treason, but the police investigation will be tested in the court
 sabko to nahin suna na jinako suna unki sari baton kaa yahaan zikr kar sakaa hum
 But whether the questions which were being raised outside also arose properly within the House, answers were sought and answers were given
 kya nai baat hui yaa unheen baton ko on ricard kehane kii aupchaarikta puri kii gai
 Who was escaping and who was asking in front or answering

 In Punjab, Chief Ministerial candidate Amarinder Singh on Sunday tried to make a dent in the stronghold of Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and made a sharp attack on the ruling family on Sunday
 unhone kaha ki logon kaa jivan barbaad karne ke liye badal ke sabhi mantriyon or oesady ko satta main aane ke baad jail bhijwaayenge
 Amarinder's severe accusation of Badal government: Captain Amarinder strongly criticized Badal for his alleged increase in incidents of disrespect of the holy things growing in the state and said it was a clear attempt by the Akalis to divide Punjab on communal basis
 unhone shiad 'mantriyon ke galat kaamon' ko lekar bhi badal par nishaanaa saadhaa or udhaaharan diya ki rajasav mantri vikram singh majithia khule taur par maadak padaarthon kaa vyapaar kar rahe hai

 prabhu tum mere man kii janomain achhut hoon, mandir main aane kaa mujhako adhikaar nahin he
 But do not understand the deity, i do not have love for you
 Love is infinite, indelible, yet i will not be able to come near you
 yah apni choti si puja, charnon tak pahunchaa na sakungi
isiilie is andhkaar main, main chhipati-chhipati ai hoon
 Get lost in your feet, i have brought such a distraught mind
 See if you can recognize my mind
 jag na bhale hi samajhe, mere prabhu! mere man kii jaano
meraa bhi man hota he, main pujuun tumko, phool chadhaaun
 And to get step by step, i should be set under the feet
 i also get the rights that everyone has got the rights
 mujhako pyaar mili, jo sabko dev! tumhaara pyaar mila he
tum sabake bhagwaan, kaho mandir main bhed-bhav kaisaa?he mere pashaan! pasijo, bolo kyon hota aisa?main garibini, kisi tarah se puja kaa saamaan jutati
 He asks you to worship with great devotion and comes to the temple, but the priest, this is not your God
 dur kahin mandir achhut kaa or dur bhagwaan kahin he
main sunati hoon, jal uthati hoon, man main yah vidrohi jwaala
 This hardness, even to the God who bluntly, will not be able to bear the bondage of a ruthless society anymore
 yah jhootha vishwaas, pratishtha juthi, isamen rah na sakungi
ishwar bhi do hai, yah maanun, man meraa taiyaar nahin he
 But do not understand that God, i do not have love for you
 i also have a mind filled with love, full of love
 jag main kahin baras jane ko sneh or satkar bharaa he
vahi sneh, satkar, pyaar main aaj tumhen dene ai hoon
 And so much assurance from you, my lord! i have come to take you
 Tell me, you do not have faith in these things
 chhut-achhut, dhani-nirdhan kaa bhed tumhaare paas nahin he
 Rahul Gandhi had devised a new formula by eating food at the homes of Dalits in Uttar Pradesh, although the effect of this formula was not seen in favor of Congress in UP assembly elections

 Shah said that the Akhilesh Yadav government of Uttar Pradesh wants to win the Lok Sabha elections by intimidating administrative officials and using them, but it should understand that the election is won by public opinion and not by terrorizing it
 unhone kaha ki sapa sarkaar pichde varg ke adhikaron par daaka daalkar muslim varg ko vibhinn yojanaon main 20 pratishat aarakshan de rahi he
 Shah claimed that the SP government wants to withdraw the prosecution from 21 terrorists

 The hands of the police are still empty in the case of the murder of Rohit Shekhar, son of ND Tiwari, former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand
 police ke shaq ke radar main or 3 log hai
 Shaka is on Rohit's wife, driver and servant
 police sutron kii maane to patni apurva bahut soch-samajhakar police ko bayaan de rahi he
 In police interrogation, she told that she went to Rohit Shekhar's room
 rohit shekhar ke katl kii mistry lagaataar gaharaati ja rahi he
 His wife's statement is under question
 police sutron kii maane to taaja bayaan main unki patni ne ye mana he ki vah 15-16 april kii raat unke kamare main gai thi
 But only because she is his wife and she went there for the relationship between husband and wife
 ho saktaa he is dauraan kuch aisa hua ho jisase rohit kii maut hui ho
 But the police do not think that Rohit can die
 haalanki, police kaa maananaa he ki ek vakil hone ke naate use pataa he ki kya bolnaa he or kya nahin
 Please tell that Rohit was very intoxicated at that time
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki agar aisa hua bhi to apurva use turant aspataal kyon nahin le gai
 Apoorva also says that Rohit had a sleeping disorder for a long time
 aise main unhen thodaa bhi shaq nahin hua ki bistar par lete hue rohit mar chukaa he
 So he neither tried to awaken her nor took her to the doctor
 police ke mutabik rohit ghar kii pehali manzil ke kamare main tha
 His next room was wife Apoorva, driver Akhilesh in the front room and servant Bholu on the second floor above him, the police suspect these three people
 police ghar ke baaki sabhi logon ko kareeb-kareeb clin chit de chuki he
 According to the police, CCTV investigation revealed that apart from these three people no one came or went on the first floor
 police kaa kahana he ki driver or naukar katl main shaamil honge, isaki koi vajah ab tak nahin mili he
 Apoorva is a lawyer in the Supreme Court, so he will also know the consequences of killing
 ho saktaa he hatya kisi aavesh main aakar kii gai ho
 According to the police, till now the case does not appear to have been a conspiracy-related murder
 haalanki, police ko forensik report kaa bhi intjaar he jisase ye sabit ho ki us raat shekhar ke kamare main koun tha
 Because the police have not even found evidence of a scuffle with Rohit
 sisitivi jaanch se pataa chalaa ki us raat pehali manzil par sabase pehle rohit, phir driver akhilesh phir naukar bholu or phir apurva gai
 Apoorva also asked servant Bholu to check Rohit's status at around 3 am the next day
 apurva ne ye bhi daawa kiya ki rohit ko anidra kii beemaari thi
 So nobody woke him up for 16 hours

 dilli par dabadabe ko lekar dilli sarkaar or centre sarkaar ke bich jang jagajaahir he
 The public always has to bear the brunt of this war of both
 2016 main jab is maamle main hoicourt ne apana faisla diya to us samay centre ne kaha ki 'ye hamaari jeet he'
 Now the Delhi government (kejriwal government) is calling the Supreme Court's decision its victory
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne SC ke faisle ke turant baad twit kar ise dilli kii janata kii jeet bataai, or supreme court kaa dhanyavad kiya
 While Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodiyane termed the decision as historic, he said that now the government will be able to do its work
 jabaki bijepi or congress kaa kahana he ki supreme court ne apane faisle main kuch nayaa nahin kaha he
 The Court has only reiterated what is in the Constitution and there is no such thing as the victory of the Delhi Government in it
 darasal supreme court ke faisle ko dilli sarkaar or centre sarkaar apane-apane tareeke se bhunaane main lagi he
 In such a situation, both the parties are taking the important points of the court's comments and decisions in their own way
 lekin ham aapako bataate hai ki supreme court ke faisle se kisko kya mila or kiske liye ye jhatka sabit hua or kiskaa paksh sahi main majboot hua?dilli sarkaar ke paksh main ye batensupreme court ne apane faisle main kaha ki dilli kichuni hui sarkarhi rajya ko chalaane ke liye jimmedaar he
 Justice Chandrachud said that politicians and officials should work together even in the midst of differences
 asli shakti or jimmedaari chuni hui sarkaar kii hi banati he
 With the decision of the Supreme Court, the transfer of officers has now come to the Kejriwal government, which is a big win
 dilli sarkaar ke khilaaf batensupreme court ne sabase pehle apane faisle main kaha ki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja nahin mil saktaa he
 Apart from this, the elected government can make laws in all matters
 justise chandrachud ne kaha ki raashtra tab fail ho jaataa he, jab desh kii loktantric sansthaaen band ho jaati hai
 The court said that the independent powers have not been given to the Lieutenant Governor
 police, lau and order or land ke maamle main sabhi adhikari alji ke paas hi rahenge
 That is, these demands of the Kejriwal government were turned down
 centre ke paksh main SC kii batendilli main police, lau and order or land ke maamle main sabhi adhikari alji ke paas hi rahenge
 Apart from this, the elected government can make laws in all matters
 supreme court kii peeth ne kaha he ki alji kaa kaam rashtrahit kaa dhyaan rakhana he
 The court said that all the decisions of the Council of Ministers must be conveyed to the Lt
 Governor, but this does not mean that the Lt
 Governor's consent is required
 centre ko naseehatsupreme court ne kaha he ki uparajyapal dilli main faisla lene ke liye swatantra nahin hai, alji ko cabinet kii salaah ke anusaar hi kaam karnaa hoga
 The Lt
 Governor cannot hang the decisions of the Cabinet
 unhen is baat ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie ki chuni hui sarkaar ke paas logon kii sahmati he
 The SC said on behalf of the Lt
 Governor of the Lt
 Governor that the Lt
 Governor should decide only on the advice of the cabinet, otherwise the matter should be referred to the President
 justise chandrachud ne kaha he ki alji kaa kaam dilli sarkaar ke har faisle par rokatoke karnaa nahin he, naa hi mantriparishad ke har faisle ko alji kii manjuuri kii jarurat nahin he
 The verdict of the verdict: The Supreme Court in its judgment said some things which both sides need to understand
 chif justise deepak mishra ne tippanee karte hue kaha ki uparajyapal ko dilli sarkaar ke saath milakar kaam karnaa chahie
 There is no place for any kind of anarchy in Delhi, the government and LG should work together
 dilli kii sthiti baaki centre shasit rajyon or purna rajyon se alag he, isliye sabhi saath kaam karen
 Chief Justice Deepak Mishra commented that following the Constitution is the duty of all, it is collective duty to take administrative decisions according to the Constitution
 SC ne kaha ki centre or rajya ke bich bhi sauhardpurn rishte hone chahie
 States have the right to exercise constitutional right under the state and concurrent list
 gauratlab he ki dilli ko lekar ye bada faisla paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth ne diya he, jisamen chif justise deepak mishra ke saath justise eke sikri, justise eem khanvilakar, justise divai chandrachud or justise ashok bhushan shaamil the
 After the separation of Captain Amarinder Singh from the cabinet, Navjot Singh Sidhu is preparing to land on the political pitch of Delhi
 mana ja rahaa he ki dilli congress pradesh adhyaksh kii kaman siddhu ko haathon main di sakati he
 Now the question arises whether Sidhu will leave Punjab and try his luck on the Delhi pitch? Earlier, he had left BJP only on this condition, because he did not want to leave Punjab and go out
 ab congress bhi bijepi kii tarj par siddhu ke saamne vahi shart rakh rahi he
 Navjot Singh Sidhu has always been knocking in the eyes of Congress leaders of Punjab ever since he left the BJP and entered the Congress
 isi ke chalate siddhu ko punjab kii captain amarinder singh sarkaar kii cabinet se istipha dena padaa
 Sidhu has remained silent ever since he resigned from the Punjab cabinet
 vah amritsar main apane samarthakon se mil to rahe hai, lekin apane siyaasi bhavishya par koi baat nahin kar rahe hai
 Meanwhile, the talk of making Sidhu the President of Delhi Congress is strong
 navjot siddhu ko agar dilli kii kaman saunpi jaati he to desh main sambhavat yah pehla maamla hoga ki ek pradesh main vidhayak hote hue koi netaa duusare pradesh kaa adhyaksh bana ho
 Sidhu is currently an MLA from Amritsar East
 bataa den ki navjot singh siddhu ne bijepi keval isi shart par chodi thi ki vah punjab chhodkar nahin janaa chaahate the, jabaki bijepi siddhu ko haryana se chunaav ladvana chaahati thi
 Sidhu had rejected this condition of the BJP and said goodbye to the party
 ab congress bhi siddhu ko punjab se baahar duusare rajya kii siyasat main utaarna chaahati he
 In such a situation, the question is whether Sidhu will leave Punjab and get on the political pitch of Delhi
 shila dikshit ke nidhan ke baad dilli pradesh congress main shunya kii sthiti bani hui he
 Sheila brought the party from third to second place in Delhi with her experience in the Lok Sabha elections
 aise main congress shila ke kad ke netaa ko pradesh adhyaksh kii kaman saunpna chaahati he
 Considering the views of Delhi's Sikh community, the Congress wants to bet on Navjot Singh Sidhu

 Which included government agencies, courts and other agencies

 pichley saal inhen maheenon ke dauraan maangi gayi jaankaree ke mukaable 391 zyada logon ke bare main jaankaree maangi gayi
 Google's report shows that the number of information seeking from Google is increasing year after year
 gauratlab he ki google ne 2009 se ye report prakashit kerani shuru kii he, jisamen is baat kaa khulaasa hota he ki kis sarkaar ne kitne logon ke bare main jaankaree maangi
 But it is not the case that the treasure of information hidden within the Google account of the people is only noticed by the Government of India
 google kii report bataati he ki puri duniya se 2017 ke pehle chah maheenon main 48,941 baar google acount ke bare main jaankaree maangi gayi
 Two songs of the film 'dilwale' have been released so far and now Bari is that song which is also a favorite of Shah Rukh Khan, the lead actor of this film
 yah gaanaa he 'janam janam'
 In this song released on Thursday, the magic of Shah rukh-kajol's Ramance is truly praiseworthy
 yah gaanaa blike and vahit ke daur kii film '420' ke gane 'pyaar hua ikraar' kii yaad dilaataa he
 Shahrukh and Kajolakyam have proved to bring back memories of Raj Kapoor and Nargis' Under Umbrella Romance through the song 'janam Janam'
 is gane ko utyub par khub pasand kiya ja rahaa he
 Right now the song has got more than 11 lakh viewers on youtube
 shahrukhane is gane ke bare main twit karte hue likhaa he ki yah gaanaa film main unka sabase fevorett song he

 dekhen film 'dilavaale' kaa gaanaa 'janam janam': Captain Amarinder Singh took oath of office and secrecy as Chief Minister at Punjab Raj Bhavan in Chandigarh
 amarinder singh ke saath 7 cabinet or 2 rajya mantriyon ne bhi shapath grahan kiya
 Today, Captain Amarinder Singh was sworn in at Punjab Raj Bhavan in Chandigarh with 7 cabinet and 2 ministers
 mantriyon ke bich mantralayon kaa bantwaaraa bhi ho gaya he
 Who has got which ministry Captain Amarinder Singh has kept the Ministry of Home Affairs with him
 chunaav ke thik pehle bijepi kaa saath chhodkar congress kaa haath thaamne vaale navjot singh siddhu ko sthaneey nikaay mantralay, paryaton or saanskrithik maamalon, abhilekhaagaar or sangrahalay mantralay kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya he
 Apart from this, Manpreet Badal has been given the charge of Ministry of Finance, Planning and Employment Generation
 aruna choudhary ko shiksha mantri banaaya gaya he
 Charanjit Channi has been made the new Minister of Technical Education and Industrial Training of the state
 vahiin rana gurjeet ko sinchai or bijli mantralay, sadhu singh dharmsot ko van, chapai or steshnari, anusuchit jatiyon or pichhadi jati kalyaan mantralay, razia sultan ko shahari vikaas mantralay, mahila evam bal saamaajik vikaas mantralay or brahm mohindra ko swasthya, parivaar kalyaan, anusandhan, chikitsa shiksha or sansadeey maamle mantralay kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya he
 However, the most surprising thing during this period was that Navjot Singh Sidhu, who is considered to be a strong contender for the post of Deputy Chief Minister, had to be content only with the post of Cabinet Minister
 sutron ke mutabik, captain amarinder singh sahit punjab congress ke anya puraane va varisht netaaon kaa dhada nahin chahta tha ki vidhansabha chunaav se mahaj 15 din pehle party main shaamil hue siddhu ko punjab sarkaar main duusare number ke pad par bitha diya jaae
 This pressure of the faction of these old Congress leaders also worked and despite continuous pressure on the High Command and Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, Sidhu continued to become Deputy CM
 dipti siem pad naa milane kii yah tis siddhu ke chehre par bhi dikhi
 When Navjot Singh Sidhu came to the stage to receive the show, he did not greet Captain Amarinder Singh like the other ministers and he ignored Captain Amarinder Singh even when he was returning under oath

 After this, Sidhu also touched Captain Amarinder Singh's feet and took his blessings
 is purv cricketer ke chehre par dipti siem kaa pad naa milane kii tis tab bhi saaf dikhi, jab shapath grahan ke baad patrakaron ne unase sawaal kiya ki punjab ke logon ke liye bataur mantri vah kya karne vaale hai, to siddhu in tamaam sawaalon ko darkinar karke media ke sawaalon se bachate najar aae
 The Congress tried to cover up this resentment of Sidhu and the pain of losing the post of Deputy CM
 punjab congress ke kai netaa to is sawaal ko taal gaye or kai netaaon ne kaha ki siddhu ne naa to dipti siem kaa pad maanga tha or naa hi congress kii taraf se party jwoin karte vakt unhen aisa koi vaada kiya gaya tha
 On this whole issue, Punjab Congress in-charge Asha Kumari said that the things that are arising about the speculations of the Deputy CM are the media-created net
 unhone kaha, 'in kayaason main kisi bhi tarah kii koi sachai nahin he
 Sidhu is the real soldier of the Congress party and wants to work in the interest of Punjab without wanting any post
 ' Congress surrounded the government in the press conference, raised many questions - PM should not campaign in foreign elections
 Congress made inflation, unemployment and security an issue
 Congress spokesperson Sharmishtha Mukherjee fiercely targeted the BJP government
 unhone kaha ki desh kii janata kai samasyaon se ghirakar pareshaan he lekin america main pradhanmantri narendra modi kah rahe hai ki bharat main sab kuch acha he
 Mukherjee besieged the government over the price of petrol rising for the last seven days
 unhone kaha ki petrol kii keemat badhane se har cheez kii mahangaai badhegi
 He said that due to the economic downturn, there are constant snatching of jobs in the country and PM is doing everything right
 sharmishtha mukherjee ne kaha ki videsh main agar pradhanmantri kaa joardaar swaagat hota he to yah desh ke liye garv kii baat hoti he
 The country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru also received tremendous respect abroad
 itnaa nahin indira gandhi, rajeev gandhi or manmohan singh kaa bhi videshon main kai baar joardaar swaagat kiya gaya tha
 This has made the country feel proud
 lekin pradhanmantri modi ne america main jaakar videshi chunaav ke liye prachaar kiya yah uchit nahin he
 He said this during a press conference held at the Congress headquarters
 aapako bataa den ki piem modi ne hust main houdi modi kaarykram ke dauraan kaha tha ki abaki baar trump sarkaar
 The Congress has surrounded the government on this issue
 sharmishtha mukherjee ne kaha, ''duusare desh ke chunaavon main jo bhi sarkaar chunakar aati he hamaara sambandh us sarkaar ke saath acha hota he
 But it has never been a foreign policy of India that the PM of the country go to another country to campaign for anyone
 congress isse sahamat nahin he
 Sharmistha Mukherjee raised the issue of rising inflation, unemployment and security in India, taking the government to the fore on every issue in turn
 unhone kaha ki piem ne america main kaha ki bharat main sab kuch acha he
 Saying this, he cannot back down from his responsibility
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ko jawaab dena hoga ki vah mahangaai ke mudde par vah kya kar rahi he
 He said that the excise duty on petrol has increased manifold in Modi's first government
 45 saal main berogari charam par he
 The unemployment rate is 8 percent and 8 crore people are unemployed
 jidipi 5 fisadi tak pahunch gai he
 Production has come to a standstill
 sarkaar smart city kii baat karti he isse pehle ek surakshit rajdhani to de
 In the end the Congress asked the question whether the Prime Minister would come to India and ask that howdy farmer and howdy youth
 aap noujvaan hai or aapke paas master degree he to shaayad aap 2 hajaar rupee prati ghante tak kama sakate hai

 But for this job of 5 thousand, you will have to work on your deal and face and not sit in front of the computer for hours and be cautious with CV

 europea champion portugal fifavishwa cap 2018main shuukravaar ko jab padosi spain ke khilaaf apane abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karegaa, to sabhi kii nigahen christiano ronaldo par tiki rahengi
 Ronaldo will probably make his last attempt to win the World Cup trophy in his bright career
 spain kii team is match main kochajulen lopeteguico achaanak barkhaast kiye jane ke faisle ko bhulaakar maidan par utregi
 Lopetegui is going to join Real Madrid, which is Ronaldo's club
 yahi nahin, spain ke chah khilaadi bhi is club se jude hue hai or isliye jab 33 saal ke ronaldo apane club ke saathiyon ke khilaaf najar aaenge to yah dilachasp najaara hoga
 Ronaldo, however, is not thinking about the club, but the World Cup, because if there is no trophy in his name then it is the World Cup
 portugalko khitaab kaa prabal daavedaar mana rahaa he
 He won the European title by defeating France two years ago
 ronaldo bhale hi ab 33 saal ke hai, lekin vah shaareerik taur par majboot hai or vartmaan balon dior vijeta he
 He can play for as long as he wants, but it is difficult to imagine his return to his fifth World Cup in 2022
 agar unhen apane naam ke aage vishwa cap vijeta jodna he to yah sarvshereshth mauka he
 What could be better is Portugal winning the top against Group b in a win against their neighbors, with Iran and Morocco being the other two teams
 portugal ke unke saathi joo mario ne kaha, ‘nishchit taur par christiano ronaldo abhi duniya ke sarvshereshth khilaadi he or vah is vishwa cap main sheersh khilaadi rahegaa
 There are no words to describe it
 ’portugal ne isse pehle jab kisi bade toornament main spain ko haraaya tha, tab ronaldo us match main khele the
 Portugal won 1–0 in this match of the Euro 2004 group stage
 vah tab keval 19 saal ke the or ab vah apane desh kii taraf se sarvaadhik gol karne vaale khilaadiyon main shaamil hai
 Ronaldo has 81 goals to his name
 algeria ke khilaaf haal ke maitri match main unhone apana 150waan match khelaa
 He had played only 25 minutes in the Euro 2016 final and had to sit out due to injury
 tab ider ke atirikt samay ke gol se portugal champion bana tha
 Ronaldo has been able to score only three goals in three tournaments in the World Cup and he will surely commit to improving his record in Russia
 portugal ko iske baad iran or morocco kii apekshaakrit kamjor tiimon kaa saamana karnaa he
 Ranbir Kapoor was born on 28 September 1982
 unke janm par vaise to kapur khandaan kaa har shaks khush tha, lekinraj kapoorki khushi kaa koi thikaana nahin tha
 There was a special reason for this
 darasal, raaj kapur ko pehla pota mila tha, jo unhen dada kahegaa
 Everyone else was his granddaughter or he was going to get another surname
 rishi ne apni kitaab khullam-khulla main raaj kapur ke ranbir se is pyaar ke bare main kai baaten bataai thim
 At the time of Ranbir's birth, the atmosphere of happiness in the family was different
 ranbir se pehle raaj kapur ko dada kehane vaala unka koi pota nahin tha
 The surname Kapoor was not associated with the children of Rishi's sister
 phir dhabbu ji yani randhir kapur kii do betiyon karishma or karina kaa sarnem bhi shaadi ke baad badal jane vaala tha
 In such a situation, perhaps Raj Kapoor was eagerly awaiting a grandson for his family tree
 ranbir ke janm par ye intjaar khatm hua tha
 One of the gifts that is being talked about was the family gold coin of the Kapoor family
 is par afgani main kuch akshar darj hai
 Please tell that the Kapoor family is related to Peshawar
 ranbir kapoorke pardada bashweshwaranath kapur peshawar main tehseeldaar the
 Peshawar is located in the North West Frontier Province
 isaki seemaa afghanistan se lagi he
 It is said that apart from that gold coin, a necklace of gold coins was also given by Raj Kapoor to Ranbir
 jaahir he peedi dar peedi ye viraasat aage badhati jaaegi, magar wo ahsaas jo ranbir kapur ko mila, vah sirf unke hisse main hi rahegaa or anmol rahegaa

 Team Anna will contest from Chandni Chowk and will know
 sibbal ne kaha ki unako to pehle hi aa janaa chahie tha lekin acha hua ab pataa chal jayega

 Digvijay Singh - Congress leader Digvijay Singh welcomed this new attitude of Team Anna and said that now Ramdev should also form his own party and try his hand in the election field
 digvijay singh ne kaha ki main to pehle se hi kahata tha, acha hua inlogon ne khulaasa kar diya
 Baba ramdev-baba Ramdev said on this issue that if Anna had made such a declaration, then he must have done some thinking

 gadakari ne kaha, 'jo bhi bhrashtachar ke khilaaf he, vah anna hajaare yaa baba ramdev kaa samarthan karegaa
 If Anna Hazare wants our support, we will help him
 ' unhone kaha ki team anna bijepi kaa vikalp nahin ho sakati, lekin yah congress kaa vikalp ho sakati he

 subrahmanyam swami-janata party ke adhyaksh subrahmanyam swami pehle hi kah chuke hai ki team anna vastav main yahi chaahati thi or ab unka sach saamne aa gaya he
 The party has also reposed trust in its former mps in view of the Assembly elections
 yahi vajah he ki party ne purv saansad pradeep maanjhi, balaiya nayak or shrinivas gomse ko samanvayak niyukt kiya he
 Also, 14 supervisors were also appointed

 There are just a few days left in Gujarat assembly elections 2017
 aise main jahaan ek ore congress is baar apni jeet kaa daawa kar rahi he, vahiin bijepi kaa kahana he ki kisi bhi haal main jeet unki hi hogi
 In this episode, the Minister of State in the PMO, Dr
 Jitendra Singh has claimed that no matter how vigorous the Congress is in the Gujarat Assembly elections, it will not be of any benefit
 rahul gandhi or hardik patel 'club' bhi congress ko jeet nahin dilaa paaegaa
 Jitendra Singh said that Gujarat assembly election is near and bjp's position is becoming stronger as its days are getting closer
 aap dekhenge ki 18 taarikh ko kis tareeke se baari bahumat ke saath bijepi vahaan par jeetegi
 The BJP benefited from Rahul's efforts, he claimed
 Kirahul Gandhi makes a lot of efforts in Gujarat, the faster the BJP moves there
 prajatantr kii drushti se yah bhi behatar he ki rahul gandhi ne apane aap ko chunaav ke maidan main utaara he or yah logon ke liye acha he ki vah rahul gandhi ko parakh sakenge ki vah kitne vijan vaale hai or kitna behatar kaam kar sakate hai
 There was no effect of the agreement with Hardik, Jitendra Singh claimed that the Congress and Hardik Patel's agreements would have no effect on the BJP
 kyonki hardik patel or congress kaa gubbaaraa vahaan par foot chukaa he
 i had also said earlier that in what way can a loser be able to explain to the general public of Gujarat in association with another loser
 donon ek duusare kaa daaman pakad kar ek duusare ko bachaane kii koshish main jute hue hai
 But they do not know that both will drown each other
 2017 kaa jo gujarat he, vah yuvaaon kaa gujarat he
 70% are young and majority voters here
 aap yah dekhenge ki yah saare yuva piem modi ke saath jutenge
 Rahul did not have a solid strategy, Singh said that the youth today ask questions on how Rahul Gandhi and Hardik Patel will work together to take Gujarat forward
 kyonki inke paas na to aarakshan ko lekar koi thos niti he or naa hi us par kaam karne yaa pahal karne kii koi jaankaree
 Congress says that first let's beat BJP and then see how to work for the youth
 par gujarat kaa yuva is taraf se bahalaaya nahin ja saktaa he
 Jitendra Singh also said that as soon as the Congress was discussed with the Prime Minister for comments on the tea-seller, we felt that it would be helpful for us as much as the Congress party would communicate this way
 hamaare liye gujarat kaa chunaav or aasaan ho jayega
 He said that as far as GST is concerned, the traders of Gujarat have been explained about GST and now there is no opposition among the traders of Gujarat
 shuruyaat main gujarat ke vyapaariyon main kuch ashankaayen thim, kuch galatchhemiyaan thim, jise congress party bhunaane main juty thi
 But now the traders of Gujarat are with the BJP

 rigiju ne kaha, 'aam aamadi party ko alji kohtya maamlemen aaropee nahin bananaa chahie
 The government has full faith in LG

 The Supreme Court heard the controversy over the Ram Janmabhoomi and Babri Masjid in Ayodhya
 is dauraan court ne is maamle se jude dastauez or gavaahiyon ke anuwaad ke liye sunni vakf board ko 12 hafton kaa vakt diya gaya he
 At the same time, on the demand of Ramlala Virajaman, a party in the case, the Supreme Court gave him four weeks' time
 supreme court ne iske saath hi maamle kii agali sunwaayee 5 disambar tay karte hue saaf kiya ki kisi bhi party ko ab aage or mohalat nahin di jaaegi or naa hi cese sthagit kii jaaegi
 Explain that 9,000-page documents and 90,000-page witnesses related to this case are recorded in various languages including Pali, Persian, Sanskrit, Arabic, on which the Sunni Waqf Board had asked the court to translate these documents
 bataa den ki ayodhya main ram janmabhumi or babari masjid ko lekar vivaad par supreme court main shuukravaar ko shuru hui sunwaayee main upi sarkaar kii taraf se associat solicytor general tushaar mehta ne sabase pehle paksh rakhte hue maamle kii sunwaayee sheeghra puri karne kii maang kii, to vahiin sunni vakf board ne is baat par aapatti jataai ki uchit prakriya ke bina yah sunwaayee kii ja rahi he
 At the same time, Subramanian Swamy, a litigant in the case, demanded the right to worship people at the disputed site
 is par supreme court kii peeth ne tamaam vaadiyon ko sabase pehle yah spasht karne ko kaha ki koun kiski taraf se pakshakaar he
 On this, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the Sunni Board, said that many of the parties in the case have passed away, so they need to be changed
 iske saath hi unhone kaha ki is maamle se jude dastavej kai bhashaaon main hai, aise main pehle unka anuwaad karaayaa janaa chahie
 During the hearing of the Board on Katyodhya dispute on Swamy's arguments, Subrahmanyam Swamy told the Supreme Court that this is not a civil dispute but a matter of fundamental rights
 iske saath hi swami ne ise divaani se badalakar saarvajanik hit ke maamle kii tarah dekha jaae
 On this argument of Swami, the Sunni Waqf Board protested and said, this question has already been resolved by the Supreme Court
 vakf board ke vakil sibbal ne kaha, supreme court kii 5 jajon kii bench ne 1994 main hi yah faisla sunaaya tha ki is jameen ke malikana haq se jude divaani maamle kii alag se sunwaayee kii jaaegi
 Explain that the Supreme Court has constituted a special bench of three judges - Justices Deepak Mishra, Ashok Bhushan and Abdul Nazir - to settle this very important matter
 yah bench elahabaad hoicourt ke faislon ko chunauti dene vaali yachikaaon or vivaadit jameen ke malikana haq par faisla ke liye rojaanaa sunwaayee karegi
 Shia Waqf Board put new screw in the case, just before this hearing, the Shia Waqf Board filed a petition in the court and put a new screw in the case
 shiya board ne vivaad main pakshakaar hone kaa daawa kiya tha
 The Shia Waqf Board has challenged the trial court's decision of 30 March 1946 after 70 years, in which the mosque was declared the property of the Sunni Waqf Board
 shiya vakf board ne vivaadit sthal par bataaya apana hashapani arji main shiya vakf board ne mana he ki mir baaqi niram mandirko todakar babari masjid kaa nirmaan kiya tha
 For the first time any Muslim organization officially believed that there was a Ram temple at the disputed site
 gauratlab he ki mangalvaar ko shiya vakf board ne supreme court main halafanama daakhil kiya tha
 The Shia Board suggests that a Ram temple should be built at the disputed site
 is maamle menramjanm bhumimandir trust or sunni vakf board pakshakaar hai, kyonki vivaadit sthal par adhikaar ko lekar shiya board 1946 main sunni board se cese haar chukaa he
 The mosque, located away from the Ram Janmabhoomi, says that a mosque can be built in a Muslim-dominated area at a reasonable distance from the birthplace of Bhagwan Ram in Ayodhya
 shiya vakf board ne halafname main kaha ki donon dharmasthalon ke bich kii nikatataa se bachaa janaa chahie, kyonki donon hi ke dwaara laudspikaron kaa istemaal ek-duusare ke dharmik kaaryon main baadha kii vajah ban saktaa he
 The Shia Waqf Board also said that the Sunni Waqf Board had no connection with the case, as the mosque was a Shia property
 isliye maamle ke shantipurna niptaare ke liye iske anya pakshon se baatcheet kaa haq keval shiya central vakf board uttar pradesh ko he

 Why do politicians in the country spend all their strength in campaigning just days before voting in elections? Use words to target opponents? The answer lies in the minds of Indian voters
 desh ke kareeb 45% matadaata chunaav prakriya kii shuruyaat ke baad man banaate hai ki unhen kis ummidavaar ko vot karnaa he
 Exit polls conducted at the time of voting in India and western countries, especially in the US and Britain, show that about 14 per cent of Indians decide on whom to vote
 ye aisa tathy he jo chunavi akhaade main taal thok rahe suramaaon or partiyon ko aakhri vakt tak pareshaan kiye rakhata he
 Based on the exit poll of CSDS during the last Lok Sabha elections, out of a total of 90 crore voters in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, 13 crore voters will decide the fate of the candidates on the voting day itself
 siesds ke agsit pole main 8 fisadi votaron ne agsit pole surveykshanon ke dauraan apni voting aadaton yaa raay banane ke taur tareekon par kuch bhi bataane se inkaar kiya
 However, there are also 13 percent Indian voters who do not leave their decision on the last day
 aise voter matdaan se thik pehle vaale hafte main hi apana voting prefrence tay kar lete hai
 There are 12 crore voters who form their opinion a week before voting
 18 fisadi aise voter to pakke iraade vaale hote hai
 These elect their favorite candidates as soon as the election campaign starts
 ye dodhari talwaar kii tarah hote hai
 Such voters are not affected by sudden events, political mistakes or fluctuations of the campaigns on behalf of the parties
 2014 main centre for da study of develping societiz (CSDS) kii ore se matdaan ke din karaae gaye agsit pole se nishkarsh niklaa ki 47% pratibhaagiyon ne chunaav ke elaan se pehle hi apana man bana liya tha ki kise vot dena he
 Interestingly, the remaining 47% of the voters in the country are loyal voters
 aise voter hi mayawati (bispi), akhilesh yadav (espi) or anya kshatrapon kii raajnneetik majbooti kii pahchaan hai
 Evidence suggests that political parties are well aware of this voting pattern
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main waapas muden to pataa chalata he ki bijepi or iske sahyogiyon ne uttar pradesh main kul 80 loksabhaa siton main se 73 par kamyaabi hasil kii thi
 Please tell that elections were held in Uttar Pradesh in six phases
 us vakt bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavir narendra modi ne achaanak teen charan sampann hone ke baad uttar pradesh main tabartod prachaar shuru kiya tha or reliyon kii jhadi laga di thi
 BJP data shows that between September 2013 to May 2014, Modi participated in 5827 rallies / tea discussions / events / events
 inamen se kareeb 30 fisadi yani 1787 kaarykram march se may 2014 ke bich hue the
 Election dates for that year were announced on 5 March
 kya votaron kaa aisa swabhaav asaadhaaran he? kya bhartiya kuch alag kar rahe hai jo ki america or britain jaise loktantric deshon main nahin hota? iskaa jawaab haa or naa donon main he
 British voters are determined to make up their mind long before the election
 vahaan ke kor voter yaa chunaav ke elaan se pehle hi man bana lene vaale voter kul voters kaa 51 fisadi hote hai
 In this country, the voters who made up their mind at the last minute are the lowest among the three democratic countries
 sirf 7% voter hi yahaan aise hai jinhen matdaan kii purvasandhya tak pataa nahin hota ki unhen kise vot dena he
 If there are 13 percent of the voters in India who make up their mind a week before the voting, then in Britain there are 9 percent of such voters
 britain main kanjarvative party yaa lebar party jab apana prachaar shuru karti he tab tak 33% voter tay kar chuke hote hai ki kise vot dena he
 In Britain, the picture is also clear because there are no participants in the survey who try to hide their voting nature
 atlantic ke paar jaaen to america ke voter bahut kuch bharat jaise hi hote hai
 In the 2016 US election, 8 percent of the voters were those who decided on which day to vote, either from Republicans or Democrats
 vahaan matdaan se pehle ke ek hafte main 5 fisadi votaron ne apana man banaaya
 At the same time, during the campaign of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, 24 percent of the voters decided who to vote for
 prachaar shuru hone se pehle sirf 3 fisadi voter aise the jo ki aashwast nahin the ki kise vot dena he
 While 60% of the voters were sure who to vote for
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki bharat main aakhri vakt main swing (jhukaav) ke kaarnon main se ek ye bhi he ki raay na bana paane vaale votaron ko nakadi yaa anya pralobhanon se prabhavit kiya ja saktaa he

 Kiran Bedi has hit back at AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal on the allegation of old proximity to the BJP
 unhone poocha he ki agar main bijepi ke liye naram thi to 2013 main kejariwal ne unhen mukhyamantri pad kii ummidavaari kyon ofer kii thi
 He said, 'if i keep commenting on people's things, when will i work? ' haalanki kejariwal ek angreji akhbaar se baatcheet main pehle hi kah chuke hai ki vah kiran bedi kii is 'narmi' ke bare main jaanate hue bhi vah unhen apane paale main lene kii koshish kar rahe the
 Earlier, AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal had said that Kiran Bedi was already close to BJP
 unhone yah daawa bhi kiyaaki kiran bedi ke bijepi main aane se aam aadmi party ko phayda hua he
 Speaking to English newspaper 'the Economic Times', he said that even before he joined the party, the bjp's Naiya in Delhi had reached the verge of sinking and later he himself played a big role in sinking the party
 'unhen BJP hi mili jane ke liye'kiran bedi ke aane ke baad raajnneeti kaise badali he, is sawaal par kejariwal ne kaha, 'pehle dilli bijepi banty hui thi
 There were several factions of leaders
 ab ve sabhi gut ek hokar mukhyamantri pad par kiran bedi kii daavedaari ke khilaaf kaam karne lage hai
 When asked about his first reaction to Kiran Bedi being BJP, the AAP convenor said, "it was a big surprise
" jab ye khabar mili to mujhe yaad nahin ki main kahaan tha
 But the first thought that came to my mind was that to meet the BJP alone
 ''gadakari kaa gheraav karne se roka tha bedi ne'kejariwal ne daawa kiya ki kiran bedi kii bijepi se nazdikiyon kaa andaja unhen pehle se tha
 He told, 'when we were about to besiege the house of the then BJP President Nitin Gadkari, he refused it
 hamane gheraav kiya or vah saarvajanik rup se hamaare khilaaf ho gayi
 We wanted to bring them to our side but she did not listen
 uske baad unase hamaare rishte nahin rahe
 Looks like someone has switched off
 ''tab galat thim, yaa ab galat hai?'kya vah kiran bedi ke bijepi main jane se thaga hua mahasoos karte hai, is sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha, 'main mahatvapurn nahin hum, par log hai
 i have met many people who said that if they were to join politics, the Aam Aadmi Party would have come
 agar unhen bijepi itani hi pasand thi to vah anna andolan kaa hissaa kyon baniin? yaa to vah us vakt galat thim, yaa ab galat hai

 team india main chayan ke liye yo-yo fitness test itnaa anivaary ho gaya he ki shandaar form main chal rahe khilaadiyon ko bhi darkinar karne se bisisiai ko koi gurej nahin he
 In such a situation, the question arises that when the player has the ability to score runs and take wickets, then why are they being dropped from the team due to the yo-yo test
 yo-yo test ke bina bhi in diggajon kaa rahaa he dabadabaaek samay aisa bhi tha jab khilaadi is test ke mohataaj nahin the or vah apane shandaar pradarshan kii vajah se team main bane rahete the
 Overweight players like Pakistan's inzamam-ul-haq, Sri Lanka's Arjun Ranatunga and Australia's legendary David Boon have also played excellent cricket for their country
 yo-yo test ke bina cricket ke mahanatam ballebaajon main shumaar rahe sachin tendulkar ne bharat ke liye 40 saal kii umr tak cricket khelaa or ranon kaa ambara lagaaya
 Apart from this, Virender Sehwag, who gave an explosive start to Team India along with Sachin, has also made many records for India without a yo-yo test

 Yo-yo test is now mandatory for all the players for selection in the Indian team, but due to this yo-yo test, many star players of the team are getting out
 yo-yo test main fail hone ke chalate ambati raidu jaisaa star khilaadi baahar ho gaya he
 Ambati Rayudu, who had scored runs in the IPL, was dropped from the ODI team going on India's tour of England
 aapakon bataa den ki abhi rohit sharma kaa bhi yo-yo test hona baaki he or agar rohit bhi yo-yo test ke chalate england daure se baahar hote he, to team india ko yah bahut bada jhatka lagegaa
 Shami is also out, Mohammed Shami was dropped from the team for the only Test match against Afghanistan due to failure in the Test yo-yo
 bisisiai kii yah jid bhartiya team ke liye nuksaan daayak sabit ho sakati hai, kyonki agar aise hi khilaadi team se baahar hote rahe to bhartiya team ko siries bhi england main siries bhi ganvaani pad sakati he

 a Japanese couple resorted to Ahmedabad's surrogate mother to get children

 During this, Kohli said that both of them like to talk about cricket
 unhone kaha, 'agar kisi match main use koi khaas pal bahut acha lagata he to wo match ke baad mujhase puuchhati he ki main us vakt kya soch rahaa tha
 Because this moment was like this for us but how was it for you? ”praising Anushka, Virat said,“ We talk a little bit about cricket

 @ kumarsanga2 rajasthan main chunaav kaa shankhanaad ho chukaa he or chunaav ayog ne bhi tarikhon kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 Leaders and party in the state are taking every step to get them votes in the upcoming assembly elections
 vaadon, vikaas ke gungan main ab lok devataaon kii entry bhi ho chuki he, jinke madhyam se netaa apni siyaasi rotiyaan senk rahe hai
 In fact, there have been many such great men in Rajasthan, who are worshiped as Gods today
 aisa mana jaataa he ki ve kisi bhagwaan ke avatar hai or unki puja kii jaati he
 Now even in elections, state leaders are resorting to great men associated with their class to woo the voters of a particular caste class
 vahiin sthaneey virdohi netaa bhi apane chunaav main inkaa sahaara lete rahe hai
 Recently Prime Minister Narendra Modi also started his speech in Ajmer in regional language
 jisamen unhone kaha tha, 'athai brahma swayan viraaje hai, vir tejaji ri bhoomi jathai, bathai sab log itti ghani sankhya m padharya, yaa dekh mhaaro jeev khub soro huyo, thaan sabala na mhaaro ghano-ghano naman
 
 
 In this speech too, he had mentioned Lokadevata

 According to the reports, the government has spent more than 300 crores in the construction of penaurma
 haalanki kaha ja rahaa he ki shoorveeron kii gaathaon ko logon tak pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 Come, know for which caste the leaders are trying to get into the heart of the voters with the help of which folk god
 tejaji-nagaur or aas-paas ke anya kshetron main tejaji main aasthaa rakhane vaale logon ko lekar kaaphi kaary kiye gaye
 People of the Jat community of the state have more recognition in Tejaji
 sthaneey logon ke anusaar netaa apane chunaav prachaar main lok devataaon kii baat jarur karte hai
 Please tell that Tejaji was born in Jat dynasty, on the basis of which he is called Aradhya Dev of Jats
 mana jaataa he ki jat pradesh kii 50 siton par ahm bhoomika nibhaate hai
 Rajasthan: The story of the Bhils who will write the fate of the leaders in Mewar! Veer Amar Singh Rathore - The politics of Jats and Rajputs in Rajasthan has been going on differently
 marwar main rajput samudaay se apana judaav rakhane ke liye vir amar singh rathod ko yaad kiya jaataa he
 Rajput society considers them ideal and their birth anniversary is also celebrated every year in Nagaur
 sarkaar ne bhi inaki janm sthali par khaas kaam kiya he
 Please tell that Amar Singh Rathore was a famous Rajput of Marwar
 unki veerta ke kisse puure rajasthan main sunaae jate hai
 At the same time, Rajputs hold 12 seats
 ramdev ji-rajasthan ke lokadevataaon main ramdev sabase pramukh hai or ramdeora (jaisalmer) main inkaa mandir he, jahaan rajasthan se hi nahin gujarat se bhi log aate hai
 Ramdev ji may have been a Rajput, but he has a special faith in Dalits for their work done for the Scheduled Castes
 saath hi ramdev ji hindu or musalmaan donon main hi samaan rup se lokapriy hai
 It is said that Ramdev Ji made Dali Bai of Meghwal caste his sister
 siyaasi taur par dekha jaae rajya kii kareeb 60 siton par essi-asti varg kaa dabadabaa mana jaataa he
 Pabu ji considers Pabuji as the god of cows and camels
 jodhpur or iske aas-paas ke kshetra main inaki khaas manyata he
 It is said that Pabuji had brought camels from Arabia for the first time and he laid down his life while protecting the cows
 pabu ji ke madhyam se rhika or rebaari samudaay ke vot hasil karne kii koshish har netaa kii rahi he
 Let us know that the effect of Raika and Rebari community is on many seats of Pali, Jalore, Sirohi, Jodhpur

 The film's team is engaged in a tremendous promotion for Salman Khan's Much awaited Race 3, which is going to be released after 5 days
 salmaan apni har film kii tarah is film kaa bhi grand pramotion karne main ji jaan phunkate najar aa rahe hai
 So will Race 3 prove to be a blockbuster like the rest of Salman's action drama films? Did many climax shoots for Race 3? Salman Khan said that the truth will be able to break the record of Sultan joining the 300 crore club Race 3 Talking about Salman's last release film Tiger Zinda Hai, this film was well received by the audience
 haalanki ye film salmaan kii ab tak kii sabase badi kamai karne vaali film sultan kaa record nahin tod pai lekin is film ne box offis par thik-thaak bijness kiya
 The reason for Tiger Zinda Hai being a hit was the three factors of the film - strong action, dialogues and hit music
 lekin res 3 kahin naa kahin in teenon factors main pichhadati najar aa rahi he
 The dialogues released in the trailer of the film were trolled a lot and even the four songs released so far have not shown anything special
 ab is film ke hit hone kii puri jimmedaari kahani par tiki he agar film ke twist or turn behtareen rahe to shaayad ye film acha munafa kama le
 Film trade analyst Taran Adarsh has also asked the fans through Salman's poll whether the action, thriller Race 3 film will be able to break the record of Sultan's opening day collection? Please tell Sultan on opening day 36
 54 karod rupee kii kamai kii thi
 # POLL: Countdown begins for Salman Khan's much-awaited biggie # Race3
 
 
 Will it surpass Day 1 biz of # Sultan[₹ 36
 54 cr] and emerge # salmankhan's HIGHEST GROSSER? India biz
 — taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh)june 8, 2018salmaan ne bataaya koun sa actor le saktaa he amitabh kii jagahphans ko badi ummidares 3 ke trailor or gaanon ko darshakon ke mil rahe riection se film ke kuch khaas parform karne ke asaar kam najar aa rahe hai
 Somewhere the fate of this film should not be like Salman's biggest flop tubelight
 kamjor kahani or screen play ke chalate is film ne bhaijan ke phans ko khub niraash kiya tha
 But due to Salman's stardom, this film had already managed to enter the 100 crore club
 isi kaaran ye kahana to galat nahin hoga ki agar salmaan kii res 3 box offis par darshakon ko nahin bhi bhaati he to ye film 100 se 200 karod club main to aasaani se entry kar hi legi

 The BJP (BJP) has now slowly started to demolish the fort of the opposition
 vidhansabha ke vishesh satr kaa bahishkaar kar vipaksh ne bhale hi bijepi ke abhiyaan ko feekaa karne kaa prayaas kiya ho, magar congress, basapa or sapa ke baagi vidhayakon kii sadan main maujuudagi ne vipaksh ke bahishkaar abhiyaan ko palitha lagaaya he
 The events that took place in two days during the special session of the Legislature showed a weak picture of the opposition along with the strategy of the ruling party
 vipakshi dalon dwaara sadan ke bahishkar ke baavjood sapa ke do, basapa ke teen or congress ke do sadasyon ne sadan main bhaag hi nahin liya, balki bole bhi
 It is clear from the participation of these people that these members do not like the working style of their party, so they have taken this step away from the party line
 bahujan samaaj party (BSP) ke asalam rhini ne to sadan main aakar sabko achambhe main daal diya
 However he said, "my faith was and will remain in the BSP
" lekin maine yah kadam itihaas ke panne main darj hone ke liye uthaaya he
 "some similar indications were also found with the decision of MLC Brajesh Singh Prinsu of Jaunpur to come with the government and the MLA from Purva, Anil Singh
 ye log abhi basapa ke sadsy hai
 Anil Singh has also done cross-voting in favor of BJP in the Rajya Sabha before this and openly appears on BJP forums
 samaajawaadee party ke vidhayak shivpal yadav or nitin agarwal ne bhi sadan kii kaarywahi main bhaag liya
 Both these yogis have also praised the government
 sutara bataate hai ki shivpal ko laane ke liye ek-do vidhayakon ko lagaaya gaya tha
 By bringing Shivpal, the ruling party wanted to give a different message to the SP
 congress kii raibareli sadar se vidhayak aditi singh or harchandpur se vidhayak rakesh singh kaa sadan main aana sabase zyada ascharyajanak rahaa
 However, Rakesh Singh's brother Dinesh Singh is in BJP and has also contested against Sonia Gandhi
 rakesh abhi tak parde ke peeche se bhaajapa kaa saath de rahe the, lekin vishesh satr main vah khulkar bhaajapa ke samarthan main aa gaye
 The Congress strengthened its ground by fielding Aditi Singh, the daughter of former Rae Bareli MLA Akhilesh Singh, in 2017, but her speech in the House weakens the party despite the boycott of the Congress
 haalanki party ne unhen is ghatana par kaaran bataao notice bhi jari kiya he
 They have to answer in two days now
 ab nigahen aditi ke agle kadam par hai
 Chief Minister Yogi also thanked members of opposition parties for participating in this special session
 unhone kaha ki in sadasyon ne is charchaa main bhaag lekar jataa diya ki vah pradesh ke vikaas main eemaandaaree ke saath bhagidaari karenge
 Sources say that the BJP has planned to bring close to Sonia Gandhi in its court to capture Rae Bareli after Amethi
 uski baangi sadan main dekhne ko mili he
 In the assembly elections 2017, BJP and Congress won two out of five seats of Rae Bareli, while one seat went to the Samajwadi Party
 ab yadi aditi or rakesh paala badalte hai to chaar siton par bhaajapa ke vidhayak ho jaaenge or congress shunya ho jaaegi
 This will be a big victory for the BJP
 bhaajapa ke ek bade padaadhikari ke anusaar, bhaajapa dwaara sapa or basapa ke kuch sadasyon ko apane paale main laane ke prayaas bahut dinon se chal rahe hai
 For them, leaders who have come from these parties have been engaged in this work
 abhi usamen kuch had tak hi safalataa mili he
 They believe that these years will come before the BJP in the year 2022
 varisht raajnneetik vishleshak rajeev shrivastav kaa kahana he ki 2022 kaa vidhansabha chunaav abhi dur he
 As of today, Aditi Singh will not join the BJP unless the Congress itself writes against them to the Speaker
 anyathaa 2022 tak koi sadsy aisa faisla legaa
 The election has more than two years to go
 aise main koi bhi sadsy ayogy ghoshit nahin hona chahega
 He said that the BJP will take a decision only after steps have been taken by the opposition
 vipaksh ke sadsy apni party kii kaaryastylee se sahamat nahin hai, isiilie vah is prakaar kaa virodh dikhaa rahe hai
 The house is an excuse
 haalanki vipaksh kya nirnay legaa, is par sabhi kii nigahen rahengi

 It is the golden period of Hindi in terms of popularity and business

 When Hindi is continuously gaining new success in the market and mass media, then the Hindi literature world is immersed in what thinking
 hindi ke akhaade main dangal jari aamane-saamne hai hindi or angreji
 Meanwhile, a new language is not only emerging, but it is also becoming most popular - Hinglish
 isaki popularity kaa alam yah he ki uniwarsity of wales ke british bhashaa vigyaani david crystal ne hisaab jodakar bataaya he ki duniya main hinglish bolne vaale jald hi english bolne waalon se zyada ho jaaenge
 Now the truth is that Hindi writers have to accept that the language is changing
 varanaa ek samay tha, jab hindi bhashaa par puraatanapanthi, shuddhtavaadi haaavee the, jinaki najar main hindi sanskrit kii beti hua karti thi
 After independence, there was a lot of effort that Hindi should return to its so-called roots ie Sanskrit
 nagari prachaarini sabha ke netritv main lagbhag sampradayik nazariye se hindi ko shuddh banane kii koshish kii gai
 Thankfully, most Hindi writers have moved on from that period
 aalochak namvar singh kehete hai, ''bhashaa kaa to itihaas hi rahaa he mishran kaa
 a mixture of Arabic and Persian in Urdu, a mixture of Urdu in Hindi, a mixture of Sanskrit in Hindi
 amir khusro ek saath farsi or braj main likhte the
 Many words ranging from Sanskrit to Persian will be found in the folk dialect of Tulsi and Kabir
 bhashaa to aise hi banati he
 English should come, good, Hindi will increase by this
 '' england main bhartiya apravasiyon ke bole jane vaale shabd or unke expressant vahaan kii bolchaal kii angreji main apana liye gaye hai
 Namvar Singh gives an example, "many French words are found in Bhojpuri in Mauritius
" ve kehete hai, 'latab par kitbia rakh de
 'latab is a French word, which means table
 unki bhashaa main mej french main he or kitbia bhojpuri main
 "this exchange enriched both languages
" samskruti badalati he to bhashaa bhi
 Mrinal Pandey, a Hindi writer and journalist, says, "one word in English is relationship
" hindi main iskaa kya anuwaad karenge? rishtedaari? yah ek nae kism ke rishton kii baat he
 It is a free and self-reliant choice of relationship, not a relation of blood and tradition
 liv in relationships ke liye maujuun shabd hindi main nahin he kyonki aisi koi cheez kabhi hindi samaaj main nahin rahi
 "asgar Wajahat, a senior writer and critic of Hindi, raises a finger on the narrowness of Hindi
" There has never been any leniency in Hindi to adopt English words
 is jid or adiyal ravaie ne hi hindi kaa sabase zyada nuksaan kiya he
 Otherwise, what is the reason that today the number of Hindi speakers is increasing, but the readers are decreasing? ”asgar believes that only popular media is serving Hindi
 hindi main angreji kaa istemaal karne vaale hindi ke akhbaar navabharat times ke kaaryakari sampadak ramkripal singh kehete hai, ''public medium ke saamne koi vikalp nahin he
 Only what is going on has to be accepted
 akhbaar communication bijness he
 So we have to speak in the same language that communicates to the majority of people
 ''hindi ke akhbaar hindustan ke sampadak shashi shekhar kehete hai, ''bhashaa ad jaaegi to sad jaaegi
 It is flowing water
 aaj youth kii bhashaa agar angreji he to shudgh hindi main akhbaar chhapakar ham unhen akhbaar nahin padhaa sakate
 "the language of the newspaper argues Hinglish in favor of popularity and the point is also understood
 lekin phir sahitya kii bhashaa main communication kaa aisa hi aagrah kyon nahin he? saahitiyik bhashaa yun nishpraan or duruh kyon he ki sahitya bahut kam bikta he or usase bhi kam padhaa jaataa he?hindi ke pratishthit lekhak or hans patrika ke sampadak rajendra yadav bhi sahaj bhashaa ke paksh main hai, phir bhi ve saahitiyik bhashaa ko popular medium kii bhashaa se alag rakhane kii vakaalat karte hai
 He says, "literature is never for the majority
 vah class kii cheez he
 The newspaper sells for millions, publishing 15,000 copies of Hans
 sahityak shastreeyta main ras lene vaale hameshaa thode hi log honge
 Everyone started getting that juice, it is not necessary
 ''aise main angreji kii khidki ko band kar dena kahaan tak vaazib he? english or hinglish kaa virodh hindi ko phir usee puraane pratikriyaavaadi kheme main nahin pahunchaa degaa? angreji ke professor, chintak or munshi premchand ke pote alok raay kaa tark kuch or he
 He says, "I am not against the mixture of languages, but the question is whether the strength, status and status of the two lending and consuming languages are the same?" If not, how is a transaction between a strong and weak possible? This transaction can have a role in truly enriching and advancing Hindi only if it is on Hindi terms
 ''popular medium kii bhashaa main kaam karne vaale filmkaar dibaakar banerjee bhi hinglish main gaiyr-barabari kaa sambandh dekhte hai
 He says, "in all times, the language of the upper, ruling class of the society has been different from the language of the common people
 sanskrit granthon main raja or shreshth jan sanskrit bolte hai to sevak, naukar or stri praakrit main baat karte hai
 Their language is also not there
 jab rajkaaj sanskrit main chalata tha, janata tab bhi sanskrit nahin bolti thi, na kabhi satta kii shudgh farsi janata kii bhashaa rahi
 Today the language of power is English, but it is not the language of the people
 janata kii bhashaa main angreji ke kuch shabd mila die gaye hai
 The language of the rich
 ham elite angrejidan hai, aap is tuuti-phooti hinglish se angrejidan hone kaa mugalata paaliye or khush rahiye
 "the language of power affects other languages
 jo bikta he, vah chalata he
 Hinglish is set on the same logic of the market
 lekin khud bazaar jin tarkon se chalata he, us par alag se bahes kii jarurat he
 At the moment, today the talk is again of the same romantic candle light dinner
 ise dekhakar ve bhi khush hai, jinaki jindagi main candal lite dinar he or ve bhi jo candal lite dinar vaale varg jaisaa dikhne yaa ho jane kii khwaahish rakhte hai

 Excerpts from James' e-mail interview: What was the motivation of Fifty Shades? i wanted to write a passionate love story
 yahi meri motiveshan thi
 i wanted to explore what would happen when you meet someone from a BDSM (bondage, Discipline, Sadism, and Mesotheism) lifestyle
 kitaab ke baad aapkaa jivan kaise badla?maine tivi main kaam karnaa band kar diya he
 Traveling a lot and going to places which have never been before
 aisi kamyaabi kii ummid thi?yah antertaning he—or yahi main karnaa bhi chaahati thi
 What attracted readers to the dictating woman and the ruling man? This is a fantasy that some people would like to study if they would like to live in their lives
 kitaab is bare main koi uf detii he ki feminism kaamyaab nahin rahaa?nahin
 i think Feminists also have their own fantasies
 jab kai madhyamon se sex hamaare chaaron ore bikharaa padaa he to vah kya baat thi jisase aapane sochaa ki yah irotic trilogy logon kaa dhyaan khinchegi?sach kaash to mujhe nahin pataa
 Probably because at the heart of Fifty Shades Trilogy is a love story, which is why this series is so successful
 logon ne apni imotional jarney ko ek aisi fantasy main khoja jise ek amir aadmi ne rachaa he
 If the story were just about sex, i don't think it would have had such a craze
 ise kab or kaise likhaa karti thim?main akasar der raat ko likhti thi yaa phir kaam par jate samay train main
 i would write whenever i had a chance
 maine tivi dekhnaa or baahar janaa band kar diya—main deewangi se likh rahi thi
 i used to listen to the same song again and again to maintain my focus
 aapako pathakon kii lav livj ko masaaledaar banane kaa credit mil rahaa he?mujhe sabhi umr or varg kii auraton ke i-mail aate hai—aisi auraton kii sankhya zyada ho rahi he jo sex ko or zyada enjvoy karnaa chaahati hai
 Mostly, she writes that her husband and partner are also grateful to me
 vaaki yah behtareen baat he ki auraten or achche dhang se yaa zyada sex kar rahi hai
 What to say about mummy porn? i think it's an easy word for journalists
 yah sex ke saath ek pashnet lav story he
 Many such books are in bookshops
 jab log pyaar main padate hai to ve sex to karte hi hai
 But since November last year, it has gained in America
 auraten iske bare main har jagah baaten karti najar ain to unhone ise mummy porn kah diya
 But reading this book from college students to eighty years old woman
 unamem se kai mummy nahin hai

 Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni came to bat at number 4 in Ranchi ODI
 pichley match main 80 ranon kii pari khilne vaali dhoni is baar chook gaye
 In such a situation, the pressure of finishing the match and the responsibility of playing the finisher came to the batsmen at the number 5, 6 and 7, but the pressure of the slowing wicket and the increasing runrate every over could not bear the young batsmen

" strike rotate karne or badhate ranret kaa dabaav rahata he
 These young cricketers will take some time to fit into this role

 'vipakshi party indian neshnal lokdal ne bhi behatar parinaam kii aashaa jataai he, lekin surveykshanon main use bahumat ke aankade se dur, haalanki duusari sabase party ke rup main dikhaaya gaya he
 There has been speculation in surveys about the Congress sweep
 pradesh kii kul 90 siton main se 73 saamaanya, jabaki 17 siten arakshit hai
 a total of 1,351 candidates are in the fray, as well as a record 116 women candidates

 iske alaava, chunaav maidan main haryana janhit congress (hajkaan), navgathit haryana janchetana party (hajpa), haryana lokhit party (halopa) or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) bhi he

 --- input from IANS mukhyamantri banane ke baad se hi yogi adityanath tej raftaar ke saath apni tarah kii raajnneeti puure soobe main lagu karte ja rahe the
 However, Sunday's cabinet expansion proved to be a major speed breaker for CM Yogi
 ek tarah se dekhen to is mantrimandal vistaar ke jariye piem modi ne yogi ko saaf sanket diya he ki bhale hi wo soobe ke siem hon, lekin raajnneeti main check and balance bahut jaruri hota he or keval ek vyakti kii manshaa or pasand se sarkaar nahin chalaai ja sakati
 CM Yogi's running the government of the state in this way was probably passing on to Modi too
 isiilie unke virdohi maane jane vaale shiv pratap shukla ko apane mantrimandal main jagah dekar modi ne yogi ko pehla jhatka de diya he
 Narendra Modi has also tried to handle the balance of caste equations in the most important state by making Shiv Pratap Shukla minister
 shiv pratap shukla khud gorakhpur se aate hai or party main brahmanon ke ek prabhavi chehre ko taur par dekhe jate hai
 Shiv Pratap Shukla has won the assembly elections four times in a row
 1989,1991,1993 or 1996 main MLA or upi main mantri bhi rahe
 But in order to establish his political supremacy, Yogi made him contest against Shiv Pratap and got him elected
 yaheen se donon ke bich siyaasi adaavat shuru hogi
 Yogi ended the whole politics of Shiv Pratap Shukla
 vah bijepi main said line kar die gaye the, lekin party ke prati unhone apni vafadari nahin chodi
 When Narendra Modi became Prime Minister in 2014, Shiv Pratap Shukla had a political revival after 14 years
 vah rajyasabha sadsy bane or ab modi cabinet main mantri banane ja rahe hai
 Ever since Yogi Adityanath became the CM of UP, the Brahmin community of the state was feeling restless
 soobe main DGP sahit kaaphi jilon main rajpuj samaaj ke jila adhikari or police adheekshak baitha die gaye hai
 Not only this, the Government Advocate General has also been created from the Rajput society
 yogi ke satta par virajman hote hi purvanchal ke brahman netaa maane jane vaale harishankar tiwari ke ghar police ne chhapemari kii
 The Brahmins considered it action at the behest of a yogi
 raibareli main 5 brahmanon kii hatya se brahmanon main bijepi ke prati naaraazgi or bhi bad gai
 That is why the Brahmin started feeling cheated
 aise main modi ne shiv pratap shukla ko apni cabinet main jagah dekar kai sandesh die hai
 AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, who is contesting against Narendra Modi from the Varanasi Lok Sabha seat, warned voters not to 'blindly trust' Modi
 unhone chutile andaaj main bijepi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Taking a jibe at opposition parties for calling him a 'fugitive' for quitting the post of Chief Minister of Delhi in just 49 days, Kejriwal said, "thank God that BJP was not there when Lord Ram went to exile at 14 years old" 
 varanaa vah puri ayodhya main ram ko ‘bhagoda’ bataate hue poster laga detii
 'kejriwal also gave the example of former prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri born in Ramnagar
 unhone kaha, ‘bahadur shastri ne apane siddhanton ke liye istipha diya
 Like Shastri, i will do the same
 siddhanton ke liye main 100 baar istipha dene se nahin hichakunga
 Addressing the people on Saturday in Tripolia of Ramnagar, the BJP stronghold, Kejriwal said, 'I went to some village here, where the youth started shouting' Modi Modi 'on seeing me
 main unase poocha ki modi ko desh kaa pradhanmantri kyon bananaa chahie, to unke paas koi jawaab nahin tha
 'he said,' i spoke to him
 maine unhen gas kii keemton ke badhane ke dastavej dikhaae, unhen (modi ke) cabinet main babulal bukhaaria ko rakhane ke bare main bataaya
 Everyone agreed with me and joined our party today
 ’dilli ke purv mukhyamantri ne logon se modi par ‘andhvishwaas’ na karne kii apil karte hue kaha ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke bare main media jo dikhaa rahi he jo vah vaastaviktaa se alag he
 He said, 'what the media is showing is like opium
 apana hosh mat khoen
 If you shout modi-modi slogans like blind supporters, you will regret it later

 unhone kaha ki sarkaar dilli main netaji ke liye uchit smarak sunishchit karne ke liye ek prastaav par sakriyata se vichaar kar rahi he

 Former RBI Governor YV Reddy has said that inflation management should not just be left to the monetary authorities but it also requires sensible measures from the government
 mudrasphiti par ankush ke bare main vichaar poochne par reddy ne kaha ‘mudrasphiti sirf maudrik kshetra se judaa mudda nahin he iske liye rajkoshiya paksh kii taraf se bhi sooyeeboojh bhare upaay kiye jane kii jarurat he
 ' yah poochne par ki mudrasphiti niyantran ke liye sabhi tarah ke karjon par niyantran hona chahie yaa chuninda varg main katautee honi chahie, reddy ne chuninda kshetron main rin pravaah par ankush kaa vikalp chunaa jisaki salaah arabiai ke purv governor aiji patel ne bahut pehle di thi
 Reddy released Patel's book on Monday evening
 tippaniyan Reddy said monetary policy approaches usually affect the cost and availability of loans
 lekin yadi arthvyavastha ke halaat aise hai ki kuch kshetron main vistaar kii jarurat he jabaki kuch kshetra main rin main katautee kii to aise main maudrik niyantran ke liye kuch kshetron main chayan ke vikalp ko apanaaya janaa chahie
 The former RBI governor said this is a complex situation
 maudrik niti se judi pahal (mudrasphiti niyantran) ke liye gunjaaish bahut kam he
 Higher interest rates have less effect
 lekin jo rajkoshiya sthiti he aise main koi asthirataa na paidaa ho yah sunishchit karne ke liye sab kuch karne kii jarurat he
 Asked about the idea of curbing inflation, Reddy said, "inflation is not just an issue related to the monetary sector
 For this, there is a need to take sensible measures from the fiscal side also
 ’ Asked whether all types of loans for inflation control should be controlled or cut in select categories, Reddy opted to curb credit flow in select sectors, which was suggested by former RBI Governor IG Patel long ago
 reddy ne somvaar shaam patel kii pustak kaa vimochan kiya
 The comments reddy ne kaha maudrik niti ke tareekon se aamtaur par rin kii laagat or uplabdhta prabhavit hoti he
 But if the situation in the economy is such that there is a need to expand in some areas while debt reduction in some areas, then the option of selection in some areas should be adopted for monetary control
 arabiai ke purv governor ne kaha yah jatil paristhiti he
 There is little scope for monetary policy initiatives (inflation control)
 ucch byaaj dar se prabhaav kam hota he
 But whatever is the fiscal situation, everything needs to be done to ensure that there is no instability
