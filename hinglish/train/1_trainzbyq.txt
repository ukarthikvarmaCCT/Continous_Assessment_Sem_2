 He accepted this position to serve Urdu
 apane chote se kaarykaal main unhone kabhi bhi adhyaksh kii kursi par baithkar kaam nahin kiya
 Neither had taken any facilities from the academy

 He refused to name anyone, saying that if the Chief Minister wants to know anything, he will tell them the whole situation

 According to the water board, a cleaning worker is allowed to stay inside the sewer for 15 minutes
 siver se nikalne ke baad safai karmchaaree ko kareeb 2 ghante kaa aaraam diya jaataa he
 a sanitary worker named Raj said that they have been doing sewer cleaning for 15 years

 in nai dilli railway stesan par jab ek musafir train se utraa or aato vaale ko kashmiri get jane ko kaha to meter down karne ke bajaae molbhav hone laga or baat nahin bani, lekin jab camere ne jhaanka to auto vaale kaa tone badal gaya
 i did not even talk to you
 hakeekat yahi he ki jahaan ji chaahe vahiin auto vaale jate hai
 Without cameras and mikes, we also asked three autos to go to Sangam Vihar from Connaught Place, but the matter went blank
 khaas baat mujhamen bhi nahin mike or camere main he
 As soon as we left with them, we also became very common
 auto waalon kii haa yaa na aksar unki marji kii baat hoti he, lekin dilli main ab agar aap kisi auto ke upar on duty kaa board laga dekhte hai to iskaa matlab he ki vah apni marji se nahin, aapaki marji se chalegaa
 The comments on duty hone par auto vaala manaa nahin kar saktaa
 If he still does not agree then you can lodge a complaint on the helpline of 42400400, his challan will be cut
 nae kanoon main auto vaale ko chhot sirf ghar lautate vaqt he, lekin tab bhi use do ehtiyaat baratane honge
 The board of off duty will have to be put up as well as the name of the area to which it is returning
 minto road par auto chalaane vaala rakesh kahata he ki yah pahal hamaare liye bhi acchhee he
 At least when we refuse a ride at home, our challan will not be deducted nor will anyone complain
 philhal rajdhani ke saare auto par yah board nahin lag sakaa he, par muhim shuru ho chuki he or shikayaton par karrwai bhi jari he
 During june-july, the helpline received 1093 complaints of refusal to ride, 570 overcharging and 174 complaints of misbehavior
 iske maddenjar parivahan vibhaag ne kul 5306 chaalaan kaate or 1500 auto bhi jabt kiye gaye

 The auto driver cannot refuse when on duty
 phir bhi vah na maane to aap 42400400 kii helpline par shikaayat darj kara sakate hai, uskaa chaalaan cat jayega
 In the new law, the exemption for the auto driver is only while returning home, but even then he will have to take two precautions
 upar of duty kaa board lagaana hoga saath hi us ilaake kaa naam bhi likhaa hoga jis ore vah laut rahaa he
 Rakesh, who drives an auto on Minto Road, says that this initiative is also good for us
 kam se kam ghar jane ke vakt kisi sawari ko manaa karne par hamaara chaalaan to nahin kategaa or na hi koi shikaayat hi karegaa
 At present, this board has not been installed on all the autos in the capital, but the campaign has started and action is also being taken on the complaints
 june-july ke dauraan helpline ko sawari bithaane se inkaar kii 1093, overcharging kii 570 or budtamiji se pesh aane kii 174 shikaayatein mili
 In view of this, a total of 5306 challans were deducted by the Transport Department and 1500 autos were also seized

 Facing an attack by the opposition over amendments to the land bill, the government may have limited the definition of private body acquiring land for its projects
 bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak ko charchaa evam paarit karne ke liye loksabhaa main laae jane ke ek din pehle sarkaar ne ravivaar ko vipaksh ko sanket diya ki vah privet antity (nijee ikai) shabd ko badal kar privet interprise (nijee udhyam) karne ke liye sarkari sanshodhan laaegi
 This step will be able to curb those in the private sector who have plans to acquire land
 aisi chintaa jataai gai thi ki koi nijee vyakti kisi college yaa kisi santhaan aadi ke liye jameen adhigrahan karne kii khatir apane ko ‚Äònijee ikai‚Äô ke rup main pesh kar saktaa he
 Sources said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Rural Development Minister Birendra Singh and Parliamentary Affairs Minister m Venkaiah Naidu will hold talks on the issue on Monday morning with leaders of various Lok Sabha parties
 sutron ne kaha ki samajha jaataa he ki jetali, naidu or singh ne ravivaar ko baithak kii or is mudde ke vibhinn ayaamon par vichaar vimarsh kiya
 The 2013 law of the UPA government said that land could be acquired for private companies
 endie adhyadesh or baad main 26 farvari ko loksabhaa main pesh kiye gaye sambandhit vidheyak main nijee company ke sthaan par privet antity likhaa gaya he
 Eight hours of time has been allocated to discuss this controversial amendment bill
 sansadeey sutron ne bataaya ki loksabhaa main charchaa somvaar ko shuru hogi or mangalvaar ko bhi jari rah sakati he
 input language ashmit patel or unki garlfriend actress mahak chahel is samay europe main family ke saath chhuttiyaan bitaa rahe hai
 But the news that has come is shocking
 lagbhag do saalon tak date karne ke baad is kapal ne spain main sagaai kar lee he
 Talking to Bombay Times, Ashmit said that he will get married in the coming 6 months
 jahaan ashmit apni shaadi videsh main karnaa chaahate hai to vahiin mahak kii ichha bharat main hi shaadi karne kii he
 They both dated 12 years ago but both started dating each other from 2015
 pichley saal is celebrati kapal ne tivi sho power kapal main hissaa liya tha
 ashmit-mehak is on holiday with the family, is she married PLANNING According to some reports, both have met each other's family
 ashmit ne bombai times ko bataaya ki wo mahak ko paris main prapoj karnaa chaahate the
 But during the holidays in Spain, he was sitting in a restaurant in Marbella where the view was so romantic that he felt that this is the right time
 iske baad ashmit ne mahak ko prapoj kar diya
 Ashmit also shared a photo of the proposal on his Instagram account
 riya sen kaa sex video hua tha li, ashmit patel ke saath dikhin intimateshe said YES!!! @maheckchahal # downonmyknee # engagement # ring # butwhichfinger # partnerforlife # bae # yesididit # aboutlastweeka post shared by Ashmit Patel (@ashmitpatel) onaug 18, 2017 at 12:55am pdtmahaka kaa kahana he ki vah sarprise thi or vah khushi se hansane lageen
 We did not know in which hand the finger is worn
 isliye ham kuch der ke liye ruke or iske baad ashmit ne ghutanon ke bal baithkar mujhe prapoj kiya jo bahut romantic prapojal tha
 Mehak says that the families of the two will soon decide the wedding date
 jab bhi aap kisi bhi maamle main bheed ke gusse kii tasviir dekh rahe hote hai to hamaare liye andaaza lagaana mushkil he ki aap kya soch rahe hote hai, aap sunn ho jate hai yaa koi fark hi nahin padataa
 Photographs of the crowd are also being made in various events so that it can go viral
 video banane vaale ko bharosa he ki uskaa kuch nahin bigadega
 If we do not make the video, we will not reach you that someone has been killed in this way
 is tarah kii ghatana jab saamne aati he, ninda karne vaale peeche nahin hatate
 But the number of people who remain silent is so large that at times it starts to doubt whether this silence is support of mob violence
 naakaami yah he ki aisi ghatnaayen ruki nahin hai
 24-year-old Tabrez Ansari was killed by being tied to an electric pole for seven hours
 maarane vaale ke man main kitna gussa bharaa hoga, kitni ghrinaa bhari hogi ki vah ek shaks ko jaan se maarane kii had tak martha rahata he
 It is alleged that Tabrez was caught stealing a motorcycle
 ek minute ke liye bhul jaaiye ki maar khaane vaala tabarez or maarane vaala pappu mandal he
 Forget the video of killing and watching the spectacle of the crowd
 ab aap yaad kiijie aise kitne video aap dekh chuke honge, kahin koi master skool ke chaatr ko maar rahaa he to kahin maa baap hi milakar apane bacchon kaa jala rahe hai kyonki unhone apni marji se jati tod kar shaadi kar lee he
 You have become normal with all types of videos
 phir kisase ummid kii jaae ki vah in video ko dekhakar baichaiyn ho jayega
 Happens upside down
 is video ko dekhte hi jo pratikriya aati he darasal use padhanaa chahie
 Some may have been asking that such violence did not happen in Bengal, someone must have been writing that the thief who killed was
 jaise ham bharat na hokar arab ho gaye jahaan aparaadh kii sazaa pathar maar kar di jaati ho
 Now you think what he must have been thinking when the tabrez was being tied to the pillar
 ab vah jaldi nahin bachegaa or uskaa video viral hoga
 If people have trouble with the name, then try keeping the tabrez name by Rakesh
 tab kya fark padataa he
 Probably not
 kyonki aae din aap dekhte to rahete hi hai ki kisi anusuchit jati ke ladke ko zindaa jala diya gaya
 a girl was burnt after being raped
 car takaraa gai to utar kar do logon ne kisi ko jaan se hi maar diya
 When the doctor was angry, the crowd surrounded him and killed him
 gussa or sanak main jab yah baat mil jaae ki jai shri ram bhi bolnaa he jai hanuman bolnaa he kyonki maar khaane vaale kaa naam tabarez he, tab yah sochie ki yah aadmi kis samaaj kaa hissaa he
 Is it calling Jai Shri Ram because it is tabrez or because it is calling that after killing it, all the people from the police will stand with it
 kya gaay ke baad jai shri ram kaa naam lenaa nayaa polytical license ho gaya he yaa phir ham biimaar ho gaye hai
 They are not taking the name of Ram himself, they are attacking him to kill someone else
 main yah maanakar chalata hum ki is video ko dekhne se pehle hi aap aise kai video dekh chuke hai or aap saamaanya ho chuke hai
 This video is not about Tabrez's death
 naagarik samaaj kii maut kaa video he
 Many journalists are even saying that he had stolen so the crowd became uncontrollable
 ham isi tarah hatya ko sahi tehraane ke liye tark khojate rahete hai or bheed kaa hausala badhaate rahete hai
 For example, if you catch someone in a case of theft, then tie it to a pillar and kill it for several hours so that it does not survive
 police jaanch kii baat kahati he lekin tab kya karenge jab aaropee jail se niklenge or unhen koi mantri laddu khilaataa dikh jaae
 Our colleague Harbans has told that Tabrez was coming from Jamshedpur with two friends on his own bike
 kadamdiha uskaa gaanv tha
 Three to four km from the village, the villagers catch the bike rider that is the stolen bike
 do dost bhaag jate hai or tabarez pakad main aa jaataa he
 The police is investigating, but think that if the bike comes out of the tabrez then what account will this crime go
 do saal pehle tabarez kii shysta se shaadi hui thi
 Tabrez does not have a parent
 tabarez ke parivaar vaale chori ke aarope ko nahin maanate hai
 He says Tabrez worked in Pune
 id par ghar aayaa tha
 The district of Jharkhand is seraikela-kharsawan
 jharkhand ke atirikt police mahanidesh ashish batra ne mana he ki police se chook hui he
 Two officers have also been suspended
 police ne bhi laaparvaahee kii or yah police ke mukhiya hi maan rahe hai
 Had the police taken Tabrez to the hospital instead of the lockup, had his injury been seriously investigated, what would have been known because he was handed over to the police when he died
 espi sarayakela ne bayaan jari kiya he ki '18 june ko dhaktidih gaanv ke logon ne tabarez ansaari ko camel mahato ke ghar main ghuste hue pakad liya
 It was half past two in the night
 tabarez ke saath do or log the
 Tabrez was caught and killed
 subah paanch baje police ko soochna mili, vah spot par pahunchi or praathmik chikitsa di gai
 The stolen bike is recovered
 gaanv waalon ne tabarez or uske do saathiyon ke khilaaf exiaar bhi karai
 He was sent to judicial custody after treatment at the district hospital
 22 kii subah vah biimaar padaa
 Sadar was taken to the hospital where he died
 tabarez ke parivaar waalon ne pappu mandal or anya par exiaar karai he
 He has been arrested
 24 kii subah ko camel mahato, premchand mahli, bhim mandal or sonaamu pradhan ko bhi giraftaar kar liya gaya
 The Supreme Court has made a guideline on mob violence
 pichley saal jab supreme court ne faisla diya tha tab tak 18 maheene main 66 baar bheed ne hamalaa kiya tha or 33 logon kii hatya ho gai thi
 This is the figure of indiaspend
 isi kii sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne kaha he ki bheed dwaara hatya ke liye sazaa tay ho or sansad kanoon banaae
 Has the Parliament made a law? Shouldn't Parliament have immediately enacted a law on this, the Supreme Court order is dated July 2018
 supreme court ne mob linching rokane ke liye dishanirdesh bhi tay kar die hai jise chaar hafte ke bheetar ken or rajya sarkaron ko lagu karnaa he
 The state government should appoint a superintendent of police or above in each district as a nodal officer
 is nodel afasar kii madad ke liye har zile main ek dspi kii tainaati kii jaae jinka kaam hoga bheed dwaara hatya kii sthiti kaa aankalan or niyantran
 Task forces were formed in every district to collect intelligence about the crowd
 rajya sarkaar aise zilon, sab divijanon or gaanvon kii pahchaan kare
 Where mob violence has had a past in the last five years
 aise zilon ke nodel afasaron ke liye rajya sarkaar disha nirdesh jari kare
 SHO level police officers were particularly vigilant in those areas
 supreme court ne yah bhi kaha he ki linching ke khilaaf centre or rajya sarkaar radio or television or media ke anya manchon ke zarie is baat kaa vyapak prachaar prasar kare, grih vibhaag or police vibhaag kii website par iskaa prachaar kiya jaae ki hatyari bheed main shaamil hone par behad sakht sazaa milegi
 Do you see such propaganda? It will be the duty of the central and state government to keep an eye on the inflammatory statements, messages, videos being circulated on social media
 unhen failane se roke, jinase bheed ke bhadakne kii ashanka rahati he
 Within a month the state governments will formulate policies to compensate the victims of the murderous mob
 shaareerik or manovaigyanik zakhm kii prakruti, zakhm ke kaaran rojgaar ke nuksaan vagairah ke aadhaar par moolyankan tay ho
 a separate fast track court should be set up to hear the case related to the murderous mob and the trial should be completed in six months
 mananeey supreme court ko hi ab report leni chahie ki un dishanirdeshon par rajyon or zilon main amal hua yaa nahin
 Governments have issued notifications based on the guidelines, but what is the status report on the law and compensation policy
 jharkhand sarkaar ne supreme court ke aadesh ke baad dishanirdesh to jari kar diya tha lekin aise maamalon kaa mukadmaa ladane vaale or baar council ke sadsy vakil hemanth kumaar kaa kahana he ki jharkhand main supreme court ke dishanirdesh ko sahi se lagu nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 After all, which states have enacted laws on the basis of the Supreme Court's guidelines, when we only got the name of Manipur
 sitambar 2018 main pashchimi imphal main 26 saal ke farukh khan ko bheed ne maar diya tha kyonki unhen shaq tha ki farrukh ne bike churaai thi
 In the video made of this incident, four policemen were standing there watching
 inamen se ek sab inspector bhi tha
 Farukh was killed by the mob in front of the police
 manipur main is ghatana ke baad bahut saare dharne pradarshan hue the
 Then the state government made a law based on the guidelines of the Supreme Court
 aisa karne vaala manipur pehla rajya tha
 On 8 November 2018, the Government of Manipur issued a notification
 is kanoon ke anusaar is kanoon main linching ko paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 Any mob violence is sudden or planned lynching based on religion, caste, gender, language, political relations
 har zile main rajya sarkaar aise maamalon ko dekhne ke liye ek police adhikari ko tay karegi
 a special task force will be formed to acquire intelligence in advance
 har police adhikari linching ko rokane ke liye zimmedaar kadam uthayega
 Anyone convicted of lynching will be punished for up to seven years
 ek lakh kaa jurmaana dena hoga
 If the victim is seriously injured, there will be a ten-year sentence in such a case
 3 lakh kaa jurmaana hoga
 Those involved in the conspiracy will also face similar punishment
 jharkhand main linching kii pehali ghatana nahin he
 There is a dire need of law there
 bich bich main auraton ko dian bataakar bhi gaanvon kii bheed unhen maarthi rahi he
 There is a report on this on the Firstpost website
 yah report 13 march 2019 ke din prakashit hui he
 Data from the Jharkhand Police and the National Crime Branch Bureau have been used in this
 is report ke anusaar 2001 se 2018 ke bich 590 auraton ko dian bataa kar maar diya gaya
 Between 2016 and 2018, 13 women were killed as witch in Ranchi, the capital of Jharkhand
 rajya sarkaar ne ek kanoon bhi banaaya he jise withcraft prevention act 2001 kehete hai
 Under this law, a woman who calls a witch is punished for 3 months to one year
 maatr 2000 rupee kaa jurmaana he
 When we saw the draft of this law on the website of the Jharkhand Police, there was no mention of punishment of those who killed it as witch
 sirf dian bataane kii sazaa he
 How cheap is the life of women
 is kanoon kaa koi asar nahin he
 Professors from IIT Patna and Central University of Jharkhand have written a research paper on it
 bani bedi ne research get website se is research paper ko nikaala he
 Shamser Alam and Aditya Raj have written in their research that most of the cases killed by telling witch do not reach court
 agar pahunchate bhi hai to gavaah nahin milte hai
 Police investigations are not conducted properly
 sazaa bhi bahut maamuli he
 The data of the National Crime Branch Bureau is also not complete
 isamen sirf maar di jane vaali auraton kii sankhya hoti he
 There is no mention of staining women with hot iron, cutting off body parts

 But at the same time she was filled with a highly complex personality and contradiction, which made her a controversial personality
 indira ne apane 16 varsh ke pradhanmantritv kaal main anek aise kaaryon ko anjaam diya jisase bharat kii sthiti vishwa str par shashakt hui

 But India has not gained much from this
 bangladesh main chal rahi gatividhiyon se bharat ko jab tab do chaar hona padataa he
 Historian Bipin Chandra writes in 'india After Independence' that the 1971 victory is Indira's personal victory in the true sense
 lekin varisht patrkaar rambahadur raay ne kaha ‚Äòjeet main tatkaaleen raksha mantri jagjivan ram or sena kii bhoomika bhi koi kam mahatvapurn nahin thi
 'india was less affected than other countries due to the economic recession in 2008
 iskaa shrey bainkon ke rashtriyakaran ko diya gaya
 The work of nationalization was done by Indira Gandhi
 lekin seth ise rajnatik prachaar kehete he
 Seth said, "if she was so forward-looking and far-sighted, why not liberalize
" agar 1980 ke dashak main udaarikaran kiya gaya hota to bharat aaj china se peeche nahin hota
 For the Emergency imposed by Indira in 1975, Bipin Chandra has emphasized on the reasons like economic, social and politics
 lekin raay ise raajnneeti or satta ke liye kii gai karrwai bataate he
 Indira further rectified her mistakes and made a comeback in 1980 again
 seth ise loktantr kii swabhaavik prakriya bataate he to raay iske liye vipaksh main jari ghamaasan or jaiprakash narayan dwaara indira ko maafee dena maanate he
 Indira also attempted to deal with challenges such as poverty, separatism and communalism
 ‚Äògaribi hataao‚Äô naaraa or bees sutreey kaarykram ke jariye garibi par prahaar kiya
 But she could not develop any kind of strategic structure to get rid of these problems
 raay kehete he ki indira punarvaapasi ke baad hichkichaahat or saavdhaanee kii pravriti se grasit ho gai thim
 Despite all these things, Indira's biggest feature was that she considered the strength of the country and the power inherent in it important
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki unhone 1974 main parmaanu pareekshan karne kii anumati pradaan kii
 She was always ready for the people

 Lalit Modi had used the names of the UK royal family, including Prince Charles and his brother Andrew, in the UK Home Department office for travel documents
 ek media report main yah daawa kiya gaya he
 According to a report in The Sunday Times, Queen Elizabeth ii's second son Andrew had known Modi for some years and met Modi at his London residence last July
 iske kuch dinon baad hi modi ke yatra dastavejon ko sweekruti mili thi
 Buckingham Palace declined to say anything about the conversation between the two, but at the same time categorically denied that Andrew had lobbied for the British government in favor of Modi
 ipel 2010 main sattebaaji or match phixing ke aaropon ke bich lalit modi landan chale gaye the
 He, however, denied doing anything wrong, saying that his life was threatened in India, which is why he had to come to Britain
 2014 main unhone british yatra dastavejon ke liye aavedan kiya tha, jise 'yatra pramaan patr' kehete hai
 The comments june 2014 main kith vaij ne britain ke vija or avrajan vibhaag ke mahanideshak sara rapasan ko modi ke dastavej ko sweekaar karne ke liye kaha tha
 On July 2 last year, he shared Lalit Modi's case with another home department official
 unhone likhaa, "modi ne suchit kiya he ki vah wales ke rajkumaar charles se mili the or do din pehle rajkumaar andrew se bhi mili the
 Both of them had asked to settle the matter, as they had told about their sister's wedding and talks with people other than the President of Seychelles
 " Vaiz said that he had taken steps according to the information Modi had given him
 pehali baar modi ke yatra dastavej ke aavedan ko agle din hi asweekaar kar diya gaya tha
 Andrew was seen with Modi on 21 July last year and Vaiz once again spoke to Rappson on 31 July citing Sushma Swaraj's support
 akhbaar ne daawa kiya ki iske 24 ghanton ke bheetar hi unako yatra dastavej mil gaye the
 Modi has not yet responded to this
 'da sande times' kii ek report ke anusaar rani elizabeth dwitiya ke duusare putr andrew kuch varshon se modi ko jaanate the or pichhali july main modi se unke landan sthit awaas par mili the
 a few days later Modi's travel documents were approved
 buckingham pales ne donon ke bich hui baatcheet ke bare main kuch kehane se manaa kiya, lekin saath hi is baat se bhi spasht taur par inkaar kiya ki andrew ne modi ke paksh main british sarkaar se kisi tarah kii lobing kii thi
 Lalit Modi had moved to London in IPL 2010 amid allegations of betting and match fixing
 unhone haalanki kuch bhi galat karne se inkaar karte hue kaha tha ki bharat main unke jivan ko khatra he, isi kaaran se unhen britain aana padaa
 In 2014 he applied for British travel documents, known as 'travel certificates'
 tippaniyan In June 2014, Keith Vaiz asked the Director General of Britain's Visa and Immigration Department Sarah Rappson to accept Modi's document
 pichley saal 2 july ko unhone lalit modi ke maamle ko grih vibhaag ke ek anya adhikari se saajha kiya
 He wrote, "modi has informed that he met Prince Charles of Wales and also met Prince Andrew two days ago
 donon ne unhen maamla sulajhane ko kaha tha, kyonki unhone apni bahan kii shaadi or seychelles ke raashtrapati ke alaava anya logon se baatcheet karne kii baat bataai thi
 " vaij ne kaha ki unhen modi ne jo jaankaree di thi uske anuroop unhone kadam uthaaya tha
 For the first time, Modi's travel document application was rejected the very next day
 pichley saal 21 july ko andrew ko modi ke saath dekha gaya tha or vaij ne 31 july ko ek baar phir sushamaa swaraj ke samarthan kaa hawala dete hue rapasan se baat kii thi
 The newspaper claimed that they had received travel documents within 24 hours of it

 Usha Kiran Khan, the author of four novels, four plays, a poetry collection and a story collection in Maithili, said that the urge to read in women was awakened after men and since women started reading, they have started speaking
 unka daawa he ki purush se zyada srujansheel stri hoti he

 On the question of being selected for the Padma Shri, Usha says that it is a pleasure to receive an award, but that does not affect creativity
 isliye sahityakar puraskaron ko zyada tavajjo nahin dete
 Writers just keep writing in their own tune

 They claim that there are more creative women than men
 unka kahana he, "striyon ne lekhnee ke madhyam se jo bhi vyakt kiya, vah unki bhaavana he
 The imagination of women is less imaginative, more is the real reality
 " When asked about the difference between female and male litterateurs, Usha Kiran, who reached Patna Book Fair, said that there is no difference between the two

 Although this unprecedented order would seem to suggest a genuine fear of a massive terror strike directed at Amarnath ji yatris or / and tourists this will do nothing to dampen the sense of fear & foreboding that prevails in the valley at the moment

 When the electricity bill of Ganga Nursing Home in Raigad suddenly started coming down, then the officials of Chhattisgarh Electricity Distribution Company were shocked
 23 disambar, 2010 ko satarkta vibhaag ke dal ne nursing home par chapa maaraa to pataa chalaa ki bijli ke meter ke paas jaimar laga hua he isliye meter band he
 Not only did the department impose a fine of 1,96,000 on the nursing home, but also filed a police complaint
 chhattisgarh-jo agle chah maah main korba sanyatra shuru ho jane par bijli ke maamle main sarplus rajya ban jayega, desh ke pehle jiro power cat rajya kaa apana darja kaayam rakh paaegaa, isamen andeh hi lagata he kyonki yahaan ajab-gajab tareekon se bijli chori kii ghatnaayen din-ba-din badhati hi ja rahi hai
 Recently, half a dozen cases of power theft by jammer have shocked the authorities
 haalat yah he ki bijli vitaran kendron se upabhoktaaon tak supplai ke bich hi ek-tihaai se zyada bijli chori ho jaati he
 In some places 60 to 65 percent of the electricity is stolen
 is puure nuksaan kaa hisaab lagaaein to har saal yah aankada 1,300 se 1,400 karod ru
 Sits us par jaimar ke rup main bijli vitaran company ke saamne or bhi bada sankat khadaa he
 Reason, it is not easy to catch power theft from jammer, this is also believed by the officials of Electrical Vigilance Department
 adhikariyon ke mutabik yah kaam chunauti bharaa isliye hoga kyonki harek meter kii nigaraanee kerani padegi, jo vyaavhaarik rup se sambhav nahin he
 To prevent theft, the distribution company replaced more than 95 per cent of the state's electro mechanical meters
 inhen kholkar aasaani se band kiya ja saktaa tha isliye vibhaag ne electronic meter kaa rasta nikaala
 But even this could not prove to be effective
 vibhaag ke paas aise dheron maamle hai jinamein chumbak or remote ke jariye bijli chori pakadi gai
 According to the vigilance department, 314 cases of theft by installing electronic meters in the Durg district alone were caught in a year
 rajya main meter bypass karke bijli chori karne ke maamle bhi kam nahin hai
 Bypass means power theft by pulling the line from the wire connecting the meter, this stops the meter from moving
 pichley ek saal main rajya main vibhaag ne meter bypass ke 186 maamle pakade hai
 According to company officials, some areas of the state have become notorious for power thieves, especially Raigad, Mahasamund, Kawardha and Durg areas
 durg ke bemetara, balauda ilaake main 50 fisadi tak bijli chori hoti he
 The situation is that when the department pulled out the tender for the franchise of electricity distribution, for some centers, even an application did not come
 mahasamund jile kaa basna, saripali, kawardha kaa panderiya, raigarh jile kaa dabhraa, barmakavla, jaanjgir jile kaa sakti, aise hi ilaake hai jahaan satarkta vibhaag ke karmchaariyon ko jane ke pehle sau baar sochna padataa he kyonki in ilaakon main bijli chori pakadaney gaye adhikariyon par kai baar hamale bhi ho chuke hai
 However, the introduction of automatic meter reading system has prevented thefts in industries
 iske liye sanyantron main chip lagaae gaye hai jisase vibhaag ke control room ko 24 ghante khapat badhane-ghatane kii jaankaree milti rahati he
 But Subodh Singh, managing director of the distribution company, says that due to the large number of domestic consumers, it is not possible to install automatic systems
 idhar bijli choron or adhikariyon kii mileebhagat bhi company ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab bani hui he
 Officials of the distribution company also do not deny this
 jaahir he, remote se bijli chori vibhageeya logon ke sahyog ke bina sambhav nahin he kyonki aisa karne ke liye meter ke andar ek chip daali jaati he or electronic meter ko vibhaag ke log hi khol sakate hai
 If someone tries to open it, the seal will break

 mishra bataate hai ki raigarh jile main jaimar ke jariye chah sthanon par bijli chori pakadi gai
 All these places had meters of the genus company
 satarkta vibhaag kii jaankaree main yah bhi he ki jis vyakti ne raigarh ilaake main jaimar supplai kiye hai vah pehle jinas company main hi naukari karata tha
 There have also been frequent complaints of mismatch in meter purchases
 vaise sarkaar bijli chori ke masale par kuch gambhir jarur dikh rahi he
 Chief Minister raman singh ne pehali baar ek iees adhikari subodh singh ko vitaran company kaa prabandh nideshak banaaya he
 Subodh has an image of an honest officer and has started a vigorous campaign against the power thieves as soon as he takes charge of the distribution company
 tabhi to 2009-10 ke 1,478 maamalon kii tulana main 2010-11 main bijli chori ke 3,110 maamle pakde gaye
 Subodh Singh says that the line loss has decreased by 4 per cent in a year and the effort is to bring it in an ideal position
 unki sakhti kii vajah se haal hi main bilaspur main jinas company ke 6,000 meter pareekshan main fawl ho gaye
 Even in 2005-06, 81,250 meters of the Amco Company and 11,000 meters of the Genus Company were rejected by the Electricity Board after the magnetic test failed
 magar baad main takneekee visheshgy samiti banaakar inhen paas kar diya gaya
 Power officials went against the rules and the genus company received Rs 25 crore
 kaa vistaar order de diya he
 Now the Public Commission is investigating this case against the officers
 vaise, zyaadaatar logon kaa maananaa he ki bijli chori par agar ankush lag jaataa he to bijli dar sasti ho sakati he
 Sharadchand, a former member of the State Electricity Board, Distribution, says that the rate will definitely vary if theft is reinforced
 magar bijli vibhaag se ucch pad se sevanivrutt hue ek adhikari kii maane to jab tak rajnatik ichhashakti na ho tab tak chori par lagaam lagaana sambhav nahin he
 Free single light connection scheme launched for the weaker sections of the government is also overshadowed
 rajya jab bana tha tab kareeb 6
 There were 5 lakh single light connections which increased to 13
 5 lakh ho gaye hai
 People are running everything from tubelights to fans, televisions, coolers under the guise of this connection, which deserves a bulb
 lekin yah sab jaanate-boojhte bhi adhikariyon ke liye inhen pakadana tedi kheer hekhyonki aisa karne par vot bank kii raajnneeti shuru ho jaati he
 In the same situation in the villages, when the campaign was launched to stop power theft in Raigad district, the people's representatives staged a sit-in in front of the office of the then Superintending Engineer Subhash Chanda, in which leaders of all parties were involved

 Electricity thieves remain one step ahead of the power officials
 chori rokane ke liye vibhaag jaise hi nayaa rasta nikaalata he, chor har baar isaki kaat dhund nikaalte hai
 To prevent the magnet from closing the meter, the electricity department asked the companies to make such meters which started moving fast as soon as the magnet was passed
 magar isamen dikkat yah hui ki dhokhe se agar chota chumbak bhi meter ke paas chalaa jaataa tha to vah tej ghoomana shuru kar detaa tha
 After this, the order was that if the meter did not run faster than the magnet up to 100 ml taxa capacity, then the power thieves started closing the meter with the help of spark gun
 spark gan yani dupahiyaa vaahan ke plag ke spark se jis tarah karant nikalataa he, usee tarah spark gan kii karant se meter chalanaa band ho jaataa he
 But this used to close only 35 QVA meters, so the department started making meters of more capacity than this
 isaki kaat main bijli chor remote or jaimar le aae
 "there is neither police help nor political encouragement in stopping power theft," says Sharad Chand
 yahaan tak ki police kwataron main bina meter ke bijli chalati rahati he vahiin vot bank kii vajah se netaa nahin chaahate ki bijli choron par karrwai ho
 "they say that the aerial bunge should be replaced in place of the bare wires so that the king (pulling the wires and drawing power) does not occur
" rajya main bijli nuksaan kii baangi dekhie, 2010-11 main bijli board ko vibhinn sanyantron se 17,601 million unit bijli mili, isamen se 12,098 million unit hi kharch ho pai baaki 5,503 million unit bijli pareshan or vitaran haani main chali gai
 The standard loss of power loss is 15 percent but the state is suffering 18 percent more damage
 vidambnaa yah he ki rajya banane ke baad utpaadan par to jor diya gaya magar los rokane ko lekar vidyut board kabhi gambhir nahin rahaa
 This is the reason that the loss in 2002-03 at the time of the formation of the electricity board 33
 76 fisadi thi, vah 2009-10 main badhkar 34
 27 percent
 baharhaal, chori rokane ke liye bijli vitaran company ne bhi qamar kas lee he
 Subodh Singh explains that the transformer will be fitted with meters, so it will be easy to find out which area is getting more stolen
 jin ilaake main hooking se bijli chori ho rahi he vahaan bhumigat taar bichaai jaaengi
 Apart from this, spot billing has also been started in some cities
 isse bhi chori par lagaam lagegi
 Provision of reward has also been made for complaints of power theft

 remoteismen meter ke bheetar ek chip daali jaati he
 In electronic meter this is not possible without the connivance of the people of the department

 He said that looking at international relations, what should be the language of the Prime Minister's level, i understand
 lekin sena kaa hausala buland ho iske liye desh piem se thodi kadi bhashaa kii apeksha karata he
 The Red Fort is the best place to boost the morale of the country's army
 unhone kaha, 'pradhanmantri ji laal kile se bole
 But i am speaking from the famine-stricken Kutch from where the voice is first heard from Pakistan and Delhi later 'serimodi, the son-in-law on corruption', also criticized the UPA government for corruption
 unhone kaha ki jaise pehle tivi serial aate the, vaise ab karpshan ke serial aate hai
 The first was a serial tour of nepotism
 phir nayaa serial aayaa mamaa-bhaanje kaa or ab aage badhate hue saas-bahu or damaad kaa serial shuru ho gaya he
 PM Modi, immersed in the devotion of a family, spared the pm's speech from nowhere
 unhone kaha, 'main piem kaa bhaashan sun rahaa tha ki hamen bhi prerana mili
 But i was very disappointed
 puraa desh niraash hua
 Hey you are the Prime Minister, but in your speech at the Red Fort, you just drowned in the devotion of a family
 nehru or indira kaa zikr karte hue kya acha nahin hota agar aap sardaar patel ko bhi yaad karte
 You would also mention your own party, Lal Bahadur Shastri

 'sab sarkaron ko diya gujarat ke vikaas kaa shreypradhanmantri par haaavee rahane ke liye modi ne chaalaak rajaneta kii tarah gujarat ke vikaas ke liye duusari sarkaron ko bhi shrey diya
 He said, 'it is not just our business
 gujarat ke vikaas main 6
 5 crore Gujaratis contribute

 It is the contribution of our mixed strength

 ' In Madhya Pradesh, the Bharatiya Janata Party is now going to resort to casteist politics
 sarkaar ke mantri babulal gaur ko apane naam ke aage jati kaa khulaasa karne arthath yadav likhane kaa nirdesh dene se aisa hi lagata he
 Gaur also announced to follow the direction of the party organization
 party ke pradeshdhyaksh prabhaat jha ne ek baithak ke dauraan mantri gaur se anurodh kiya ki ve tathaa unki putravadhu apane naam ke saath yadav likhen
 His reasoning behind this was that by writing Gaur, it is not known which Gaur goes
 gaur ne kuch patrakaron se charchaa karte hue sweekaar he ki party ke pradeshdhyaksh or rashtriya sanghathan mahaamantri raamalaal ne unhen apane naam ke aage yadav likhane kaa nirdesh diya he
 He has also decided on the direction of the organization that now he and his daughter-in-law, who is the Mayor of Bhopal Municipal Corporation, will write Yadav with their names
 gaur ne aage kaha he ki ve yadav hai magar logon ko unki jati kaa pataa hi nahin chalata he,lihaaja ab ve apane naam main yadav bhi jodenge
 Not only this, they also do not mind writing caste with names
 bhaajapa sanghathan dwaara gaur ko apane naam ke saath yadav likhane kaa nirdesh die jane par congress ne hamalaa bolaa he
 Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Ajay Singh has termed the move as promoting casteist politics in the state

 These paddy will now be sold to liquor contractors at the cost of a penny, so that they can use it to make liquor
 sarkari afasaron kii laaparvaahee se karodon kaa yah nuksaan sarkaar ko uthaanaa padaa he
 With the help of the central government in the state, paddy worth ten thousand crores is purchased annually
 is dhan kaa chaaval nikaal kar sarkari godaamon main rakhaa jaataa he
 After which the rice reaches the common people through PDS
 haal hi chhattisgarh ke sarkari rashan dukaanon main saikadon ton daal sadane kii khabar bhi surkhiyaan bani thim
 This waste of food money is happening when even today a section of the country does not have enough food
 iske liye sanchalit kii gai daal-bhaat yojana bhi isliye thapp pad gai, kyoki unhen rajya kibijepi sarkarassta rashan muhaiyaa nahin karvaa pai
 Neither responsibility nor action is serious
 Neither measures are taken nor legal action is taken against the responsible officers to prevent wastage of food grains
 yah haal tab he jab chhattisgarh desh main dhan ke katore ke naam se prasiddh he
 Bumper paddy is grown in a large part of the state
 kisaanon ko dhan kaa samarthan mulya mil sake, unki zyada se zyada fasal kharidi jaae, iske liye kisaanon se lekar tamaam rajnatik dal jaddojahad kii baaten to khub karte hai
 But what happens to the paddy being purchased from the government coffers, it is in front
 khule aasmaan ke neeche sad rahaa hajaaron ton dhanahakeekat kaa jayja lenaa ho to rajya ke dhan utpaadak jilon kaa rukh kiijie
 Mahasamund, Bemetra and Dhamtari, Balod and Durg from Raipur
 raipur se bilaspur, balaudabazar, bhatapaara, mungeli yaa phir champa jaanjgir
 Even today, thousands of tons of paddy will be seen in an abandoned condition under the open sky on both sides of the roads leading to these districts
 inamen zyaadaatar dhan ko laaparvaah tareeke se rakhaa gaya he
 His cap covers have been torn, while cap covers have not been installed in many places
 natijatan, dhan barish main bhig kar sad gaya
 On giving notice to the babus, many of these sacks were put on the cottages and in some parts paddy earrings have also grown
 janata kii khun paseene kii kamai se ye dhan kharidi gai thi, lekin laaparvaahee aisi kii dhan kaa dher dekhakar aapaki aankh fatty kii fatty rah jaae
 No responsible officer came forward for this negligence
 naa to pukhta jaanch hui or naa hi kisi ke khilaaf karrwai kii anushansa
 Yes, if the details of the rotten paddy came to the Food Minister for the auction whereabouts, notice of action was sent against two-four babus and three munis
 is notice main likhaa gaya ki kyon naa unki tankhwaah se nasht hui dhan kii rakam kii vasuuli kii jaae
 Food Minister denied paddy rot, State Food Minister Punnulal Mohle gives his arguments in this whole matter
 pehle to wo dhan kii barbaadi se hi inkaar karte rahe, lekin jab hakeekat se rubaru hue to karrwai kaa hawala dene lage
 Mohale says, 'there is no question of paddy rot
 cap cover he or 12-13 kaa jo dhan he uskaa grading hua he
 Tendering is taking place
 nivida banaakar uski nilaamee kii jaaegi
 Action is being taken for paddy which is without cap cover

 There was a police complaint against him
 is tarah ke alag-alag prakarnon main paanch babu or teen sosayadi prabandhakon ke khilaaf kaarywahi hui he
 Regarding the waste of paddy
 dhan sadane ke baad kisi kaam kii nahin rahati
 It is neither eaten by animals nor can be of any use
 sivaay iske kii sadane ke baad iskaa istemaal sharaab banane main ho
 Therefore, the paddy of Arabs is given to the liquor traders at auction
 varishton ko bachaane main jute adhikarikisaanon se dhan kii aasaani se kharidi ho sake, iske liye rajya sarkaar ne gaanv-gaanv main dhan sangrahan centre banaae hai
 The farmer sells his paddy in these collection centers
 is dhan ke bhandaaran or uthaav kii jimmedaari rajya ke viparan sangh kii he
 This government organization plays an important role in paddy transportation
 samay par is dhan kaa uthaav ho sake iske liye khaadya vibhaag ke afasaron se lekar viparan sangh ke adhikari jimmedaari sambhalate hai
 But when a large amount of paddy wastage comes, every officer is trying to save his senior officers
 'maamle kii honi chahie sibiai jaanch'halaat yah hai ki barbaad hui dhan ke liye kisi ko bhi jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja sakaa he
 In the fear of splitting the paddy game, the whole department is busy in daub
 rajya ke pramukh RTI kaaryakarta virendra pandey kehete hai, 'rajya sarkaar kii kisi bhi mashiniri se masale kii jaanch nahin ho sakati, kyonki kai bade sarkari afasar sarkaar se jude mantri or netaa is ghotaale main shaamil hote hai
 Therefore, there should be a CBI inquiry into the matter
 ' pandey kehete hai ki dhan ko suniyojit rup se isliye sadaaya jaataa he ki bade paimaane par is dhan ko khule bazaar main bech diya jaae
 The details of rotten paddy are recorded in the register to employ the difference between demand and supply
 is tarah se ek bade ghotaale ko anjaam diya jaataa he

 The Supreme Court has also instructed the state governments to stop wastage of food grains, but its effect is not seen in Chhattisgarh

 " Sucha Singh Chhotepur, former convenor of the Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab, has retaliated against Chhotepur, AAP leader Himmat Singh, after he targeted Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwaj and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and other leaders
 aap netaa or party ke legal cell pramukh himmat singh shergill ne chhotepur ke aarope nakaarte hue kaha ki, agar wo sikh dharm ko lekar arvind kejariwal se khafa the, to vah aaj tak chup kyon baithe hai
 During a press conference held in Kochindigarh on Thursday, Shergill said that, on 26 August, Sucha Singh Chhotepur has made the allegations against Arvind Kejriwal in front of the media
 kyonkisuccha singhchhotepur bataur canavinar rishwat ke rup main do lakh rupye lene ke aaropon main ghire hue hai, or unhone party or media ke saamne yah do lakh lene kii baat maani bhi he
 Because a sting taking money came out as evidence
 isliye chhotepur ne arvind kejariwal par jhootha aarope lagaaya he
 Shergill said that on August 26, what Chotipur mentioned in his charge of Amritsar is August 18
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki yadi arvind kejariwal ne chhotepur par aise aarope lagaaein he, to ek sikh hone ke naate unhen usee samay arvind kejariwal ke saamne virodh karnaa chahie tha
 This should have been made public by holding a press conference
 lekin unhen kyon nahin kiyachhotepur ne do lakh rupe rishwat lene kii baat kabuuli:himmat singhhimmat singh shergill ne kaha ki aam aadmi party main daan ke rup main fund lene ke liye saral or spasht niti he or party fund ke rup main liye gaye ek-ek paise kaa hisaab rakhaa jaataa he
 Chotepur has also lied that the party has no cashier
 puure punjab main party ke sabhi 13 jone or ek mukhya rajyastareey str kaa bank khaataa he
 Chhotepur has confessed in front of Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Munish Sisodia and the media that he did not give any receipt of Rs two lakh at that time
 unkekaboolnameke aadhaar par hi party kii piesi ne chhotepur ko canavinar pad se hataakar puraa maamla do sadassiy cameti ko saunp tha
 Shergill also made it clear that the party's rallies and public meetings are not held by the fund given by Conviner Chhotepur or any leader, it is managed by the funds raised through the party and local level organizers, which is fully accounted for
 
 bhagwant maan kaa kiya bachaavhimmat singh ne bhagwant maan ke baach kiya he unhone kaha ki jab tak maan ke khun kii jaanch ke aadhaar par ye aarope sabit nahin ho jaataa

 jabaki bhagwant maan ne sukhbir badal or captain amarinder singh samet sabhi virdohi netaaon ko chunauti di hui he ki sabhi kaa dope test hona chahie
 Andhra Pradesh has described itself as an Open Defecation Free (ODF) state, whereas the ground reality is something else
 dakshin rajya ne ek kadam aage jate hue khud ko ODF Plus bataaya he
 However, people feel that these claims are limited to papers only
 pichley saal june main tatkaaleen mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu ne rajya ke ODF hone kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 He claimed that the state had 2
 77 lakh nijee shauchalay banaakar rajya ke lakshya ko paar kar liya he
 Let us know that on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti in the year 2016, all 110 urban local bodies of the state claimed that they have achieved the target of ODF through Swachh Andhra Corporation (SAC)
 SAC kii sthapana rajya sarkaar ne 2015 main svachh bharat mishan ke lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye kii thi
 However, there are many people who do not accept these claims of the government
 unka kahana he ki gramin or shahari sthanon par abhi bhi log khule main shouch ja rahe hai
 Social worker V
 in Vijayawada
 satyanarayan ne kaha, 'saarvajanik sthaan par shauchalay bana dena hi lakshya nahin ho saktaa
 What about their maintenance? Anyone can see in the city, people are still urinating in the open near them instead of toilets and this is due to lack of maintenance of toilets built
 've
 Satyanarayana claimed that there is no synergy between different departments
 unhen bina talmail ke banaaya gaya he
 Because of this, more toilets are not usable
 unhone poocha, 'unhone uchit jal nikasi bhi sunishchit nahin kii
 Many public toilets either have water stagnation or are stinking
 sirf shauchalay bana dene se sarkaar kii jimmedaari khatm nahin ho jaati he
 What happened to their maintenance? ' jammu-kashmir ke upmukhyamantri nirmal singh ne apni mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ke us aarope ko khaarij kiya he, jisamen kaha gaya ki kashmir ke halaat ke liye centre sarkaar jimmedaar he
 Singh said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak that the state is moving ahead with the help of the central and state government
 pidipi-bijepi kii sarkaar main dipti siem nirmal singh ne kaha, 'mahabuuba muftika yah aarope sahi nahin he
 The center is helping Jammu and Kashmir a lot
 centre kii madad se hi ham aage bad rahe hai
 Pakistan is fully responsible for the situation in Jammu and Kashmir
 'kya kaha tha mahabuuba nebta den ki swatantraaa diwas ke maukey par siem mahabuuba mufti ne kashmir ke halaat ke liye jawahar laal nehru se lekar narendra modi tak kii centre sarkaar ko doshi tehraaya tha
 The CM had said, 'the central leadership from Jawaharlal Nehru to the present is responsible for the current situation in Jammu and Kashmir
 bandooken chaahe aatanki kii ho yaa hamaari,banduukon se koi masalaahl nahin hoga
 'read, the key parts of the conversation - the question - Who is responsible for the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, and when will the situation be fine? Nirmal Singh - Pakistan has been continuously since Jammu and Kashmir merged with India
 tab se sharaarat kar rahaa he or vahaan par aise halaat banane kii koshish karata he ki vahaan sthirataa naa ho
 He has promoted terrorism
 1947 se vahaan par jo halaat hai, uske liye to vah jimmedaar he
 He has some people at the local level who support him
 jammu-kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang he, usamen vah interfare karata he
 Question- Mehbooba Mufti is saying that the Center is responsible for the situation in Jammu and Kashmir
 jo centre sarkaar kii policy he, uski vajah se ye halaat bane hai
 The problem is happening because of that? Nirmal Singh - See if something is not in front of me
 aisi koi baat nahin he
 In and out of assembly as well
 is prakaar kii koi baat nahin ai he
 But with the support of the Center, things can move forward only with the support of the Government of Jammu and Kashmir
 iske liye hameshaa centre se sahyog mila he
 Jammu and Kashmir is not the only internal matter
 bahari dakhal jo he pakistan kii taraf se jo sidhaa hastkshep he
 He is responsible for that
 sawaal- bharat kii policy pakistan ko lekar kuch aakraamak hui he
 Be it the issue of pok or Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the issue of Balochistan
 achaanak yah change kyon?nirmal singh-hameshaa se pakistan ke saath baatcheet karne kii baat hui
 They do, but they do mischief in between
 ugravadiyon ko andar bhejte hai
 Innocent people are killed here
 sidhe-sidhe prime ministar ne yahaan par jo halaat hue hai us par bayaan diya he
 If he puts a question mark
 jammu-kashmir ke vilay ko lekar lagaate hai, to jab vibhaajan ho rahaa tha north west kshetra main bhi, jab unase vibhaajan ke vakt bhi un logon ne apni ichha jaahir kii thi ki ham bharat ke saath janaa chaahate hai
 But because his territory was not reconciled with India
 iske kaaran bhi vah pakistan main gaye
 From the heart he never wanted to go there
 lekin jis dhang se pakistan baluchistan main atyaachaar kar rahaa he
 Gilgit is doing it in Baltistan
 jo pioke main kar rahaa he
 The stand taken by the Prime Minister is the stand of the whole country
 kyonki pakistan kisi bhi jaij cheez ko maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 Question- It is being said that there will be talk on pok, not on Kashmir
 doctor jitendra singh ne kaha he ki pioke ko jald hi aaazaad karavaaenge
 They will hoist the flag there
 kab aaazaad karavaaenge or kab jhanda fahraayenge?nirmal singh-pioke ko pakistan ne gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se kabja kiya hua he
 Surely whenever there is a conversation in the coming time, it will be discussed
 vah bharat kaa abhinn ang he
 It is a part of India and people who are there are being forced by it
 vah bilkul hamaara hissaa he or usee tareeke se uske liye prayaas karenge
 This is diplomacy
 aane vaale vakt kii baat he
 Surely he is a part of us and will be a part
 hissaa banegaa to pakke taur par jhanda fahraaya jayega
 Question- Do you think the issue of Balochistan has sparked a new debate, is trying to isolate and isolate Pakistan? Nirmal Singh - Pakistan always talks about Kashmir in a variety of ways
 maanavadhikaar kaa ulanghan ho rahaa he
 Hey, you see your house, don't you? apane ghar main sindh main kya ho rahaa he? baluchistan main kya ho rahaa he? west main kya ho rahaa he? ebn punjab bhi shant nahin he? jis ugravad ke rakshas ko aapane paidaa kiya
 He is going to eat them only
 jammu kashmir main bharat ke khilaaf jis dhang se halaat paidaa karne kii koshish karte hai
 In today's date, this is the right way to deal against Pakistan in the same manner
 sawaal- burhan vaani ko lekar aapkaa bayaan aayaa
 But Mehbooba Mufti's statement came that if Burhan's presence was known then this situation would not have happened and would not have to face an encounter? Nirmal singh-burhan Wani was a terrorist and the Terrorist is treated in the same manner as Deal done bhartiya state bank ne guuruuvaar ko spasht kiya ki uske sahyogi bainkon kii unionen vilay prastaavon ke khilaaf nahin hai
 The unions of five associate banks went on strike on Thursday against the merger of the parent company
 esbiai ke ek pravaktaa ne der shaam bataaya, 'sahyogi bainkonki unionen vilay prastaav ke khilaaf nahin hai
 They have not informed us that they are against the merger
 jahaan tak hamen suchit kiya gaya he ve puri tarah se hamase alag hona chaahate hai

 pehle paak media main om puri kii maut ko sajeesh qaraar dekar iske liye piem modi or enese ajit dowaal ko jimmedaar tehraaya gaya to ab vahaan ompuri kii maut ke baad salmaan khan or fawaad khan ke murder kii bhi ashanka jataai ja rahi he
 Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Saina NC called these reports derogatory and denied that there was any political conspiracy behind Om Puri's death
 paak ankar kaa aarope- om puri kii maut ke peeche modi-dowaal kaa hathabhartiya janata party kii pravaktaa sina en
 c said that much research needs to be done before giving news to Pakistani media
 pehali baat to ye kiom purihamaare desh kii dharodhar the
 His death should not mean anything to Pakistan
 duusari baat ye ki agar unako is baat se fark padataa he to unhen kisi bhi tarah ke aarope lagane se pehle apane facts ko check kar lenaa jaruri he
 Was Om Puri's death really natural? Questions arising due to these reasons, a spokesperson of the Bharatiya Janata Party further said that here in India we believe in clean and fair media
 om puri kii maut ke baad pakistan ke ek tivi channel ke ankar ne daawa kiya he ki bollywoobhinayta om puriki maut ke peeche narendra modi or ajit dowaal kaa haath he
 The statement of that anchor was also a joke on social media
 maut se ek din pehle kya kiya tha om puri ne, bataaya ek dost neis report ke baad haal main pakistani media main khabaren chal rahi hai ki ompuri kii maut ke baad salmaan khan or fawaad khan kaa murder ho saktaa he
 These allegations are being made on the Modi government

 Claiming that unity of the opposition would not be possible without the Congress axis, a senior Congress leader has said that the bjp's defeat on its strong wicket in the Uttar Pradesh by-election has shown that Prime Minister Narendra Modi can also be defeated
 
 congress ke varisht netaa evam maharashtra ke purv mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan ne vartmaan bhartiya raajnneeti main teesraa morcha ubharne kii sambhaavna ke bare main poochne par ‚Äòbhashaa‚Äô se kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòcongress ke bina vipaksh ho hi nahin saktaa
 While Congress has one base, the other base is BJP
 ab aisa nahin ho saktaa ki congress ko hataa kar vipaksh banaaya jaye
 '' unhone mana ki dekhne vaali baat hogi ki congress apane saath kitne vipakshi dalon ko laa paati he
 Chavan, citing a comment by UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi at the recently concluded plenary, said that it had a clear message that the work that could be done after the Shimla conference could also be done in 2019
 mahadhiveshan main sonia ne dhyaan dilaayaa tha ki party ne pachmadi main anya dalon ke saath gathbandhan nahin karne kaa faisla kiya jabaki shimla sammelan main congress ne gathbandhan karne par sahmati jataayi thi
 Asked by the TDP and YSR Congress in Parliament to bring a no-confidence motion against the government and that the Congress has not yet been shown to play a leading role in the opposition's solidarity, Chavan said, "it may seem like right now
" ‚Äô‚Äô He said that Congress President Rahul Gandhi has yet to make his team
 samay ke saath yah sab bhi hoga, kaarysmiti hogi, kor team hogi, bhitari team hogi
 It was already there, but it became temporary after Rahul became the president, which would give him stability
 har rajya ke liye mahasachiv banenge or ve gathbandhan ke liye vahaan ke dalon se baatcheet karenge
 Asked about the recent statements of some NDA constituents, including Shiv Sena and TDP, against the attitude of their government, the former Maharashtra chief minister said, "see, all are shaken up after the Uttar Pradesh by-election
" yah spasht sandesh gaya he ki modi ko unke hi kshetra main haraaya ja saktaa he
 It remains to be seen that for Modi there can be no stronger wicket than Gorakhpur and Phulpur
 vartmaan mukhyamantri evam up mukhyamantri dwaara khaali kii gayi siten
 
 
 What could be a stronger wicket? If he is defeated strongly, it means that Modi can also be defeated
 ganit to pehle hi bataa rahaa tha ki unke paas keval 31 pratishat vot hai
 Now this has also been proved (with the by-election results)
 ab sawaal yahi he ki modi apane gathbandhan ko kaise ekajute rakh paayenge or hamen gathbandhan banane se kya roak paaenge?‚Äô‚Äô There has been speculation about the UP elections that the BJP did not deliberately contest elections so that the EVM dispute could be brought to an end
 is bare main poochne par chavaan ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòmain ise nahin maanata
 People also say that Yogis were beginning to present themselves as future prime ministers, so they were taught this lesson
 
 
 par yah sab galat baat he
 '' uttar pradesh main sapa-basapa ke jeet vaale gathbandhan main congress kaa saath nahin hone ke bare main poochne par chavaan ne kaha ki yah donon dal saath aayenge, kya is baat ko pehle kabhi sochaa ja saktaa tha
 But both came together and it became a winning formula
 har rajya ke liye jeet kaa apana alag formula hota he
 The coming together of Congress and NCP in our state Maharashtra is a winning formula
 unhone ek prashn ke jawaab main kaha ki vipaksh main congress hi ek aisi party he jisaki puure desh main upasthiti he, bhale hi vah kam-zyada ho sakati he
 Chavan admitted that in any state where the third power is strong, the Congress has been marginalized such as Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar or West Bengal
 lekin yadi aap puure desh ko mila kar denkhenge to ham hi sabase bada vipakshi dal hai
 You cannot imagine such a situation now that the Congress can be seen or the Congress has become irrelevant
 tiares dwaara vipaksh kii ekta ke prayaas ke peeche kya koi ‚Äòadrishy haath ‚Äô ho saktaa he, is bare main poochne par unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòmain nahin jaanata, par aisa ho bhi saktaa he
 What is the role of KCR, no one can tell
 ‚Äô‚Äô yadi ve congress ko kamjor karte hai to isse bhaajapa ko hi phayda milegaa
 About the Karnataka election, he said that the party has clearly declared Siddaramaiah as its chief ministerial candidate
 unke netritv main rajya main chunaav ladenge or rahul gandhi bhi apni bhoomika nibhaaenge
 In response to a question, he believed that if the fractured mandate came in the state assembly elections, JDS would play an important role in that situation
 ‚Äò‚Äòmain is baat ko lekar kaaphi chintit hum ki yadi spasht faisla nahin aayaa to yah log (bhaajapa) chunaav ke baad kii jane vaali jodtod main kaaphi maahir hai
 '' karnataka main kya jades bhaajapa se haath mila sakati he, is bare main poochne par unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòdevgauda to iske bahut khilaaf hai
 But Kumaraswamy's address is not known
 ‚Äô‚Äô Asked what would be the role of Chavan in Rahul Gandhi's decision to form Udayaman (resurgent) Congress and whether he is ready to take responsibility at the central level, he said that the decision will be entirely for leadership
 abhi rajyasabha kii seat kaa maamla tha jo kumaar ketakar ko di gayi
 
 
 i am very busy with state issues right now
 bhaajapa evam shivasena ke rishton ke bare main poochne par chavaan ne kaha ki ek raajnneetik vishleshak ke taur par unka maananaa he ki bhaajapa kabhi shivasena ko apane saath se alag nahin hone degi
 If Hindutva votes are divided in the Lok Sabha elections, then trouble will arise for him
 bhaajapa ko bahut nuksaan hoga
 Right now both of them have 42 seats out of total 48 seats
 ‚Äò‚Äòve loksabhaa chunaav main yah kar hi nahin sakate
 He will not allow them to separate from any way by adding arms and legs, by showing files, by putting pressure, by fear of jail, that is, stuff, price, punishment
 ‚Äô‚Äô Chavan also expressed apprehension that any move could be done to break the alliance between Congress and NCP
 unhone shivasena ke congress evam rakanpa ke saath aane kii sambhaavna se bhi inkaar kiya
 He also said that if BJP and Shiv Sena fought separately then we could benefit greatly
 chavaan ne kaha ki maharashtra main in do gathbandhanon ke alaava dalit partiyon kii bhi mahatvapurn sthiti ho sakati he
 They are very divided
 ek taraf prakaash ambedkar hai
 On the other side is Ramdas Athawale, who is with the BJP
 bhima-koregaanv ghatana ke baad bahut tanaav ho gaya he
 Hence it has many dimensions
 maharashtra main dalit raajnneeti kii bahut badi bhoomika he
 The comments sharad pavaar ke netritv vaale rakanpa se gathbandhan ke bare main chavaan ne kaha ki donon hi dalon ke varisht netaaon kii yah soch he ki inke bich gathbandhan aprihaary he
 The march of the peasants by the communists has been supported by all opposition parties
 isliye samaan vichaaron vaali partiyon kaa samjhauta ho saktaa he
 There can be consensus about seat sharing
 unhone is tarah ke gathbandhan main shivasena ko saath lene kii sambhaavna ko nakaarte hue kaha ki jab tak shivesna dharmanirpekshata kii kasuti par nahin kasi jaati he tab uskaa saath nahin diya ja saktaa
 He admitted that it would be a matter of view that how many opposition parties the Congress is able to bring with them
 chavaan ne haal main sampann mahadhiveshan main samprag adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii ek tippanee kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki iskaa saaf sandesh tha ki jo kaam shimla sammelan ke baad ho saktaa he, vah 2019 main bhi ho saktaa he
 At the plenary, Sonia had pointed out that the party decided not to form alliances with other parties in Pachmarhi, while at the Shimla conference, the Congress agreed to form an alliance
 sansad main tedepa or wiesar congress dwaara sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav laane or vipaksh kii ekajutata ko lekar congress dwaara abhi tak agrani bhoomika nibhaate dikhaayi nahin dene ke bare main puche jane par chavaan ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòabhi aisa lag saktaa he
 '' unhone kaha ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko abhi apni team banani he
 Over time all this will happen, there will be working committee, there will be core team, there will be inner team
 pehle se yah sab tha par rahul ke adhyaksh banane ke baad yah asthaayee ho gaya jise unhen sthayitv dena hoga
 There will be general secretaries for every state and they will talk to the parties there for an alliance
 shivasena or tedepa sahit rajg ke kuch ghatak dalon ke apni sarkaar ke ravaiye ke khilaaf haal main aaye bayanon ke bare main poochne par maharashtra ke purv mukhyamantri ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòdekhie, uttar pradesh upachunaav ke baad sab hill gayi hai
 It has been a clear message that Modi can be defeated in his own constituency
 dekhne vaali baat he ki modi ke liye gorakhpur or phulpur se zyada koi majboot wicket nahin ho saktaa
 Seats vacated by the current Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister
 
 
 isse zyada majboot wicket kya ho saktaa he? usko yadi majbootee se haraa diya gaya to iskaa matlab he ki modi ko bhi haraaya ja saktaa he
 Mathematics was already stating that they have only 31 percent votes
 ab yah baat sabit bhi ho gayi (upachunaav ke nateezon se)
 Now the question is, how will Modi keep his alliance united and what will prevent us from forming an alliance? '' upra chunaavon ko lekar yah atakalein lagaayi ja rahi hai ki bhaajapa ne jaanboojh kar dhang se chunaav nahin ladaa taaki iviem vivaad par viraam lag sake
 Asked about this, Chavan said, "I don't believe it
 log to yah bhi kehete hai ki yogi apane ko bhavi pradhanmantri kii tarah pesh karne lage the, isliye unhen yah sabak sikhaaya gaya
 
 
 But this is all wrong
 ‚Äô‚Äô Asked about the Congress not joining the SP-BSP winning coalition in Uttar Pradesh, Chavan said that these two parties will come together, could this have ever been imagined
 kintu donon saath aaye or yah ek jeet kaa formula ban gaya
 Each state has its own formula for victory
 hamaare rajya maharashtra main congress or rakanpa kaa saath aana jeetne kaa formula he
 In response to a question, he said that the Congress is the only party in the opposition that has a presence in the entire country, even though it may be less
 chavaan ne mana ki jis kisi rajya main teesri shakti majboot he vahaan congress haashiye par chali gayi he jaise tamilnadu, uttar pradesh, bihar yaa pashchim bengal
 But if you look at the whole country together, we are the biggest opposition party
 aap abhi aisi sthiti kii kalpana nahin kar sakate ki congress kii anedkhi kii ja sakati he yaa congress apraasangik ho gayi he
 Asked if there could be an 'invisible hand' behind trs's efforts for unity of opposition, he said, "I don't know, but it can happen
" kesiar kii kya bhoomika he, koi nahin bataa saktaa
 "if they weaken the Congress, then only BJP will benefit from it
" karnataka chunaav ke bare main unhone kaha ki party ne siddharmaiya ko spasht taur par apana mukhyamantri pratyaashee ghoshit kiya he
 Under his leadership, he will contest elections in the state and Rahul Gandhi will also play his role
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone mana ki yadi rajya vidhansabha chunaav main khandit janadesh aayaa to us halaat main jades mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaayegaa
 "I am deeply concerned that if a clear verdict is not forthcoming, these people (BJP) are very adept at manipulations to be done after the elections
" ‚Äô‚Äô Asked about whether JDS can join hands with BJP in Karnataka, he said, "dev Gowda is very against it
 kintu kumaraswami kaa pataa nahin
 '' yah puche jane par ki rahul gandhi ne udayman (risergent) congress banane kii baat he, usamen chavaan kii kya bhoomika hogi or kya vah kendriya str par jimmedaari sanbhaalane ko taiyaar hai, unhone kaha ki yah faisla puri tarah se netritv kaa hoga
 Now it was a matter of Rajya Sabha seat which was given to Kumar Ketkar
 
 
 main abhi rajya ke muddon main kaaphi vyast hum
 Asked about the relationship between BJP and Shiv Sena, Chavan said that as a political analyst, he believes that the BJP will never let Shiv Sena separate from itself
 yadi loksabhaa chunaav main hindutv vaale vot bant gayi to uske liye pareshaani khadi ho jaaegi
 BJP will suffer a lot of damage
 abhi un donon ke paas kul 48 siton main se 42 siten hai
 "they cannot do this in the Lok Sabha elections
" vah kisi tarah haath pair jodakar, file dikhaakar, dabaav daalkar, jail kaa dar dikhaakar yani sam, daam, dand bhed se vah unhen alag nahin hone denge
 '' chavaan ne yah bhi ashanka jataayi ki congress or rakanpa kaa gathbandhan todane ke liye kisi bhi tarah kii chaal chal sakati he
 He also ruled out the possibility of Shiv Sena joining the Congress and NCP
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki yadi bhaajapa or shivasena alag alag lade to hamen kaaphi phayda ho saktaa he
 Chavan said that apart from these two alliances in Maharashtra, Dalit parties can also have an important position
 bahut bant chuke hai
 On one side is Prakash Ambedkar
 duusari taraf ramdaas athavle hai, jo bhaajapa ke saath hai
 There has been a lot of tension after the bhima-koregaon incident
 isliye iske kai aayam hai
 Dalit politics has a big role in Maharashtra
 tippaniyan Regarding the alliance with Sharad Pawar-led NCP, Chavan said that senior leaders of both the parties are of the view that an alliance between them is inevitable
 abhi communiston dwaara kisaanon kaa jo march nikaala gaya, use sabhi vipakshi dalon ne samarthan diya
 Therefore, parties with similar views can be compromised
 seat bantwaare ke bare main sahmati ban sakati he
 He ruled out the possibility of taking the Shiv Sena with him in such an alliance, saying that unless Shivesana is a test of secularism then it cannot be supported
 chavaan ne haal main sampann mahadhiveshan main samprag adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii ek tippanee kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki iskaa saaf sandesh tha ki jo kaam shimla sammelan ke baad ho saktaa he, vah 2019 main bhi ho saktaa he

 uttar pradesh main sapa-basapa ke jeet vaale gathbandhan main congress kaa saath nahin hone ke bare main poochne par chavaan ne kaha ki yah donon dal saath aayenge, kya is baat ko pehle kabhi sochaa ja saktaa tha
 But both came together and it became a winning formula
 har rajya ke liye jeet kaa apana alag formula hota he
 The coming together of Congress and NCP in our state Maharashtra is a winning formula
 unhone ek prashn ke jawaab main kaha ki vipaksh main congress hi ek aisi party he jisaki puure desh main upasthiti he, bhale hi vah kam-zyada ho sakati he
 Chavan admitted that in any state where the third power is strong, the Congress has been marginalized such as Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar or West Bengal
 lekin yadi aap puure desh ko mila kar denkhenge to ham hi sabase bada vipakshi dal hai
 You cannot imagine such a situation now that the Congress can be seen or the Congress has become irrelevant
 tiares dwaara vipaksh kii ekta ke prayaas ke peeche kya koi ‚Äòadrishy haath ‚Äô ho saktaa he, is bare main poochne par unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòmain nahin jaanata, par aisa ho bhi saktaa he
 What is the role of KCR, no one can tell
 ‚Äô‚Äô yadi ve congress ko kamjor karte hai to isse bhaajapa ko hi phayda milegaa
 About the Karnataka election, he said that the party has clearly declared Siddaramaiah as its chief ministerial candidate
 unke netritv main rajya main chunaav ladenge or rahul gandhi bhi apni bhoomika nibhaaenge
 In response to a question, he believed that if the fractured mandate came in the state assembly elections, JDS would play an important role in that situation
 ‚Äò‚Äòmain is baat ko lekar kaaphi chintit hum ki yadi spasht faisla nahin aayaa to yah log (bhaajapa) chunaav ke baad kii jane vaali jodtod main kaaphi maahir hai
 '' karnataka main kya jades bhaajapa se haath mila sakati he, is bare main poochne par unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòdevgauda to iske bahut khilaaf hai
 But Kumaraswamy's address is not known
 ‚Äô‚Äô Asked what would be the role of Chavan in Rahul Gandhi's decision to form Udayaman (resurgent) Congress and whether he is ready to take responsibility at the central level, he said that the decision will be entirely for leadership
 abhi rajyasabha kii seat kaa maamla tha jo kumaar ketakar ko di gayi
 
 
 i am very busy with state issues right now
 bhaajapa evam shivasena ke rishton ke bare main poochne par chavaan ne kaha ki ek raajnneetik vishleshak ke taur par unka maananaa he ki bhaajapa kabhi shivasena ko apane saath se alag nahin hone degi
 If Hindutva votes are divided in the Lok Sabha elections, then trouble will arise for him
 bhaajapa ko bahut nuksaan hoga
 Right now both of them have 42 seats out of total 48 seats
 ‚Äò‚Äòve loksabhaa chunaav main yah kar hi nahin sakate
 He will not allow them to separate from any way by adding arms and legs, by showing files, by putting pressure, by fear of jail, that is, stuff, price, punishment
 ‚Äô‚Äô Chavan also expressed apprehension that any move could be done to break the alliance between Congress and NCP
 unhone shivasena ke congress evam rakanpa ke saath aane kii sambhaavna se bhi inkaar kiya
 He also said that if BJP and Shiv Sena fought separately then we could benefit greatly
 chavaan ne kaha ki maharashtra main in do gathbandhanon ke alaava dalit partiyon kii bhi mahatvapurn sthiti ho sakati he
 They are very divided
 ek taraf prakaash ambedkar hai
 On the other side is Ramdas Athawale, who is with the BJP
 bhima-koregaanv ghatana ke baad bahut tanaav ho gaya he
 Hence it has many dimensions
 maharashtra main dalit raajnneeti kii bahut badi bhoomika he
 The comments sharad pavaar ke netritv vaale rakanpa se gathbandhan ke bare main chavaan ne kaha ki donon hi dalon ke varisht netaaon kii yah soch he ki inke bich gathbandhan aprihaary he
 The march of the peasants by the communists has been supported by all opposition parties
 isliye samaan vichaaron vaali partiyon kaa samjhauta ho saktaa he
 There can be consensus about seat sharing
 unhone is tarah ke gathbandhan main shivasena ko saath lene kii sambhaavna ko nakaarte hue kaha ki jab tak shivesna dharmanirpekshata kii kasuti par nahin kasi jaati he tab uskaa saath nahin diya ja saktaa
 In response to a question, he said that the Congress is the only party in the opposition that has a presence in the entire country, even though it may be less
 chavaan ne mana ki jis kisi rajya main teesri shakti majboot he vahaan congress haashiye par chali gayi he jaise tamilnadu, uttar pradesh, bihar yaa pashchim bengal

 media ne shuukravaar ko isaki jaankaree di
 'dawn' quoted the officials as saying that in this ambitious project, investment will be made exclusively in the purchase of surveillance cameras, which will be installed at places of worship all over Sindh
 sindh ke mukhyamantri ke vishesh sahaayak khatumal jivan ne kaha, 'is pariyojna sepuja sthalonke suraksha str main badhotaree hogi
 According to Dawn's report, he said the project involves installing modern monitoring and control systems

 Officials said that the project was built on the instructions of Bilawal bhutto-zardari, the president of Pakistan People's Party after the attack on Hindu temples in Larkana, Hyderabad and other places

 e raghavansikh tirthayatriyon ko pakistan main kartarpur sahib gurudware tak sidhe safar kii suvidha muhaiyaa karwaane ke liye prastaavit galiyare par bharat or pakistan ke bich baatcheet ke aage badaae kii khabaren ai hai
 It would be appropriate to think on these reports for a longer time than is generally considered on such a measure of building trust
 tirthayatriyon kii aasaani se awajahi kii maang pichley kuch varshon se kii jaati rahi he
 There will be so much synergy and activism about this development, it must have surprised even the most committed advocates
 galiyare kaa shilanyas bharat ke uparashtrapati or pakistan ke pradhanmantri ne apane-apane hisse main november 2018 main kiya tha
 In response to Prime Minister Imran Khan's letter of congratulations on the victory in the General Election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month called for the corridor to be commissioned early
 donon pakshon ke bich dastavejon se lekar tirthayatriyon kii sankhya sahit dher saare muddon par baat kaaphi aage tak badaae kii khabaren ai hai‚Äîmakasad yah bataaya gaya he ki tirthayatri guru nanak kii 550veen jayanti par november 2019 main kartarpur sahib ke darshan ke liye ja saken
 What's new in this? In the days when there is some heat in the relationship, the matter of 'promoting mutual contacts between people' has become a custom for decades
 lihaaja vija kii jaruraton main dheel dena, sarhad kii vajah se dophaad ho chuke pariwaron ke bich barambar sampark kii jarurat ko maananaa, awajahi ke buniyadi dhaanche main sudhaar laana or shraddhaluon kii taraf se uthne vaali seemaa-paar tirthayatraaon kii maang se mukhaatib hona‚Äîye sab 1950 ke dashak ke shuruaati varshon se lekar is sadi main compojit dialog or uske alahada roopon tak dotarafa agendon kaa hissaa rahe hai
 Along with big political initiatives, new and important decisions have also been taken on mutual contact between people
 1971 kii ladaai ke baad 1977 main jab kootnithik rishte behaal hue, tab 1965 se sthagit dilli-lahore train seva phir shuru kii gai
 delhi-lahore bus service started in 1999 with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's famous 'bus yatra'
 2006‚Äîyani compojit dialog yaa samgr baatcheet ke shuruaati varshon‚Äîmain sindh-rajasthan kii seemaa ke paar 1965 kii ladaai ke vakt se band khokharapaar-munaabaav rail ko phir se shuru karne ke liye uthaaya gaya bada kadam tha
 At the same time, great leeway was given for darshan places
 amritsar se nankana sahib gurudware tak sidhi bas seva ne ujagar kiya ki tirthayatriyon kii khaas jaruratein hai or sarkaron ko unhen puraa karnaa hoga
 The most special of these initiatives was bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad and later also between Poonch and Rawalakot
 chunki inkaa matlab niyantran rekha ke paar awajahi thi, lihaaja inase pataa chalaa ki kootnithik aujaaron ke pitare main kitni loch or gunjaaish hoti he
 So is the Kartarpur corridor just another link in this long chain? This may seem like it, but there is an important difference
 badlaav laane vaale inamen se zyaadaatar faisle aise samay liye gaye the jab bharat-pakistan rishton main behatari kaa daur tha
 Negotiations on the Kartarpur corridor go beyond the point that it has come at a time when relations have deteriorated ‚Äî worsening with ceasefire violations on the loc, Pulwama, Balakot, etc
 pakistan ke andruni ghatnakram se bhi ugravadi dhadon ko jad se khatm karne kii kisi tarateebavaar koshish kaa ishaara nahin mila he or hindustan main lagaataar yah chintaa he ki yah galiyara pakistani agenciyon ko kisi na kisi tareeke se sikh ugravad or aatankwaad ko uksaane kaa jariya muhaiyaa kar saktaa he
 In short, talks on Kartarpur are moving towards successful results without any improvement in political environment or two-way processes
 yah asaadhaaran he
 What does this say about cross-border relations and India's Pakistan policy? First of all, indo-pak relations rarely go on the straight path
 puraani daraaren bani rahati hai, magar ve nae vichaaron ko ubharne se rokatii nahin or in vichaaron se baj dafe nai hakeekat kii jhalak milti he
 Secondly, diplomacy and foreign policy require flexibility ‚Äî that is, to keep the options open
 jaisaa ki bismark ne ek baar kaha tha, ''agar 64 main se 16 khaanon par mohare chalane se shuruyaat main hi roak laga di jaae to shatranj khelaa hi nahin ja saktaa
 "flexibility also has many benefits, especially when it comes to the international community
