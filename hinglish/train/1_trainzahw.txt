 The SP-BSP alliance has broken due to the by-election in 11 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh
 loksabhaa chunaav main bade jor-shor se bane is gathbandhan main areldi bhi shaamil thi
 The day the alliance was formed, it seemed that now this grand alliance will not only affect the politics of Uttar Pradesh in the whole country and it seemed from the talks of BSP supremo Mayawati and SP president Akhilesh Yadav that there is good coordination between the two and In the Lok Sabha elections, both of them will stop the victory chariot of PM Modi
 darasal yah aatmavishvaas gorakhpur, phulpur or kairana upachunaav main hui jeet ke baad kaa tha
 Even Mayawati did not allow Congress to join this alliance
 unka kahana tha ki uttar pradesh congress kaa koi vajood nahin he or bispi ko har baar congress ke saath gathbandhan kii vajah se nuksaan jhelana pad jaataa he
 While Akhilesh Yadav was in favor of inclusion of Congress
 lekin bispi supremeo ke ek bhi na chali
 The Mahagathbandhan was definitely stronger than the BJP in terms of vote percentage, but the BJP was very strong on the ground and its workers kept their full force, the result of which is in front of everyone
 lekin sawaal is baat kaa he ki kya mahagathbandhan kii neenv itani kamjor thi ki ek haar bhi bardaasht nahin kar paaya or dhadaam se girtaa najar aa rahaa he
 One reason for this is the by-election in Uttar Pradesh's 11 assembly seats
 mayawati ko lagata he ki bispi jab loksabhaa main 10 siten jeet sakati he to vah in 11 siton par samjhauta kyon kare
 Mayawati claims that Yadav has not been able to transfer votes to BSP, even Akhilesh Yadav could not win his wife Dimple
 unka yah bhi kahana he ki iske ulta bispi ke vot sapa ke pratyaashiyon ko transfar hue hai
 At the same time, after this announcement by Mayawati, SP President Akhilesh Yadav also replied that the SP will also contest these seats alone

 Even before this hearing the state government had instructed all the district collectors of the state that the entire event should be held in a pleasant atmosphere and no one should be pressurized to participate
 shuukravaar ko sunwaayee ke dauraan rajya sarkaar ke donon aalaa adhikariyon ne yatayaat, khaskar rajya margon or rashtriya rajmarg par vaahanon kaa avaagaman saamaanya rakhane kaa aashwaasan diya
 The state government claims that more than two crore people are expected to participate in the human chain on Saturday, and the 45-minute event includes all members of the Bihar cabinet, including Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, and leaders of most opposition parties, activists Apart from this, all officers will also participate

 During the hearing, the court gave directions to the Chief Secretary that no action should be taken against anyone for not participating in the human chain
 rajya sarkaar ne bhi is sunwaayee se pehle hi rajya ke sabhi jiladhikariyon ko nirdesh diya tha ki puraa aayojan khushnuma maahaul main hona chahie or bhaag lene ke liye kisi par dabaab nahin daalaa janaa chahie
 During the hearing on Friday, both the top officials of the state government assured to keep the traffic normal, especially on state roads and national highways

 congress ke shasankaal main muslimon ko bhay ke saae main rahane par majaboor hona padaa
 "accusing the Congress of showing a soft attitude towards the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Mayawati said that it was because of the soft attitude of the Congress that the organizations associated with the BJP promoted the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal

 The poor will not have to go to other states to earn
 meraa kahana he ki jo congress party pradesh main chalis saal tak shashan karne ke baad yahaan ke garibon kaa bhala nahin kar pai, ab vah paanch saal main unhen kaise rojgaar uplabdh karaayegi

 He will continue to contest the defamation case and has withdrawn the petition from the court for cancellation of the trial
 rahul ne yah bhi kaha ki vah aresas vaale apane bayaan par kaayam hai, the or rahenge
 The RSS people shot Mahatma Gandhi, he is adamant on this statement and will not take back his statement
 court ne rahul ko peshi main chhot dene se inkaar kar diya he
 That is, on November 16, he will have to appear in the court of Bhiwandi
 vahiin yachikakarta kaa kahana he ki rahul yah kah den ki unka makasad aresas ko doshi tehraana nahin tha to vah cese ko waapas lene ko taiyaar hai
 On behalf of the complainant Rajesh Kunte, the court said that the image of RSS has been trying to spoil it for the last 60 years
 jab bhi chunaav hote hai yaa vishesh varg ke saath kuch hota he to aise bayaan die jate hai haalanki kapil sibbal ne kaha ki raajnneetik bayaan court main nahin die jane chahie
 Significantly, the Supreme Court hearing in the criminal defamation case against Rahul Gandhi was heard on the statement of rss's hand in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi
 rahul ne trial radd karne kii maang kii
 In the last hearing, Rahul Gandhi had said in the court for the first time that he had not convicted the RSS organization and had filed the same affidavit in the Bombay High Court
 isi aadhaar par rahul ko aapraadhik manahani ke maamle main supreme court se raahat milane ke sanket mili the
 The court had indicated that the trial could be quashed
 supreme court ne kaha tha ki ham maanate hai ki rahul gandhi ne kaha tha ki unhone mahatma gandhi kii hatya ke liye RSS sanghathan ko hatyara nahin kaha tha, sirf jude logon ke liye kaha tha
 In such a situation, it does not seem to be defamatory for RSS
 ullekhneey he ki supreme court congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii yachika par sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 Rahul Gandhi has demanded the cancellation of a case related to criminal defamation running against a lower court of Maharashtra
 isse pehle vah court ke maafee maangane ke prastaav ko thukraa chuke hai
 Rahul argued that what he said was based on the trial of Mahatma Gandhi's assassination
 tippaniyan In fact, this case of defamation was filed against Rahul in connection with the alleged murder of Mahatma Gandhi in 2014 on Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 sangh kii bhiwandi ikai ke sachiv rajesh kunte ne aarope lagaaya tha ki rahul ne sonaale main 6 march 2014 ko ek chunavi raily main kaha tha ki rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne gandhi ji kii hatya kii
 Kunte said that the Congress leader tried to hurt the Sangh's reputation through his speech
 pichhali sunwaayee main supreme court ne kaha tha ki nathuram godse ne gandhiji ko maaraa, RSS ke logon ne gandhiji ko maaraa, in dono baton main bahut fark he
 You should be cautious when you speak about a particular person
 aap kisi kii samuhik ninda nahin kar sakate
 We are only investigating whether the statements made by Rahul Gandhi are within the scope of defamation or not
 court ne kaha tha ki aapako cese main trial phase karnaa chahie haalanki supreme court ne bhiwandi court ke maamle kii police se report maangane par bhi naaraazgi jaahir karte hue kaha tha ki manahani ke maamalon main police kii koi bhoomika nahin honi chahie
 Rahul also said that he stood by his statement of RSS, was and will remain
 RSS ke logon ne mahatma gandhi ko goli maari, is bayaan par vah adig hai or vah apana bayaan waapas nahin lenge
 The court has refused to grant Rahul a waiver
 yani 16 november ko unhen bhiwandi kii court main pesh hona hoga
 At the same time, the petitioner says that if Rahul says that his motive was not to blame the RSS, then he is ready to withdraw the case
 shikayakarta rajesh kunte kii ore se court main kaha gaya ki RSS kii chhavi ko pichley 60 saalon se bigaadane kii koshish ho rahi he
 Whenever elections are held or something happens to a particular class, such statements are made, although Kapil Sibal said that political statements should not be made in the court
 gauratlab he ki mahatma gandhi kii hatya main RSS ke logon kaa haath bataane vaale bayaan par rahul gandhi ke khilaaf aapraadhik manahani ke maamle main supreme court main sunwaayee hui
 Rahul demanded the cancellation of the trial
 pichhali sunwaayee main rahul gandhi ne pehali baar court main kaha tha ki unhone RSS sanghathan ko doshi nahin tehraaya tha or bombai hoicourt main bhi yahi halafanama daakhil kiya tha
 On this basis, there were indications of Rahul getting relief from the Supreme Court in the criminal defamation case
 court ne ishaara kiya tha ki mukadmaa radd ho saktaa he
 The Supreme Court had said that we believe that Rahul Gandhi had said that he had not called the RSS organization to assassinate Mahatma Gandhi, but only for the people involved
 aise main RSS ke liye manahani vaali baat nahin lagati
 It is noteworthy that the Supreme Court is hearing the petition of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 rahul gandhi ne apane khilaaf maharashtra kii ek nichali adaalat chal rahe aapraadhik manahani se jude ek maamle ko radd karne kii maang kii he

 Rajesh Kunte, secretary of the Bhiwandi unit of the Sangh, alleged that Rahul had said at an election rally in Sonale on 6 March 2014 that the RSS had killed Gandhiji
 kunte ne kaha ki congress ke netaa ne apane bhaashan ke jariye sangh kii pratishtha ko chot pahunchane kii koshish kii
 In the last hearing, the Supreme Court had said that Nathuram Godse killed Gandhiji, RSS people killed Gandhiji, there is a lot of difference between these two things
 jab aap kisi vyakti vishesh ke bare main bolte hai to satark rahanaa chahie
 You cannot mass condemn anyone
 ham sirf yah jaanch kar rahe hai ki rahul gandhi ne jo bayaan die kya vah manahani ke daayre main hai yaa nahin
 The court had said that you should face trial in the case, although the Supreme Court had also expressed displeasure over the Bhiwandi court case seeking a report from the police, saying that the police should have no role in defamation cases
 vahiin yachikakarta kaa kahana he ki rahul yah kah den ki unka makasad aresas ko doshi tehraana nahin tha to vah cese ko waapas lene ko taiyaar hai

 Apart from this, there is Kurud falling under Dhamtari district
 saath hi kori manendragarh or bhilai ke supela, khursipar or bhathapaara ke sarkari aspataal shaamil hai
 This decision of the government may also help people associated with the medical profession

 lekin kya pinjre main band tota ud paaegaa? The CAG report has been tabled in Parliament on coal block allocation
 report pesh hote hi is masale par vipaksh ne sarkaar par hamalaa bol diya he
 According to the information that has come from the report in the hands of Aaj Tak, the biggest scam in the allocation of coal mines has been revealed so far
 report ke mutabik, kol block aavanton main nijee companiyon ko 1 lakh 86 hajaar karod kaa phayda pahunchaaya gaya tha
 It is clear that the state exchequer felt the loss of this amount
 CAG ne apni report main aavanton ko lekar kadi pratiyogita kaa bhi zikr kiya he
 After the report was presented, the Opposition in Parliament termed it as a bigger scam than 2G
 bijepi ne kaha he ki pradhanmantri ko puure maamle par jawaab dena chahie
 The CAG has assessed the losses between 2004 and 2009
 bijepi pravaktaa prakaash jaavdekar ne upie ko ab tak kii sabase bhrasht sarkaar bataaya he
 He said that this government has made a world record of scams

 He said that his committee will examine the truth of the report and call all the responsible people to the fore
 samaajawaadee party ke mahasachiv ramgopal yadav ne kaha kii jimmedaari tay kii jaani chahie or jo bhi jimmedaar he use sajaa milani chahie
 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut questioned that when a Raja can go to jail, Suresh Kalmadi can go to jail, then why not the Prime Minister? BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad has directly blamed the Prime Minister on the coal scam
 ravishankar ne kaha kii koyala mantralay pradhanmantri ke paas tha, isliye wo is jimmedaari se batch nahin sakate
 a total of 3 important CAG reports are to be presented in Parliament
 in teenon report main kuch or ghotaalon kaa khulaasa hoga, jisase vipaksh ko sarkaar ko gherne kaa ek or mauka mil jayega
 Apart from the allocation of coal mines, Delhi Airport is about handing over the private company Delhi International Airport Limited ie Dial and Ultra Mega Power Project ie UMPP
 guuruuvaar ko sansad kii kaarywahi sthagit hone kii vajah se ye report pesh nahin kii ja saki thi
 These three reports describe how the government, while benefiting private companies, damaged the state exchequer

 The loss of 7 lakh crores was said
 final report main nuksaan kaa aankada 1
 8 lakh crores, benefiting Tata and Jindal Group companies
 aavanton ke vakt pradhanmantri manmohan singh koyala mantri the
 Regarding the Ultra Mega Power Project ie UMPP, the CAG draft report said that in these projects, Anil Ambani Group company Reliance Power was benefited by Rs 15849 crore
 dial ke bare main teesri draft report main kaha gaya he ki sirf 2450 karod rupye ke nivesh par dial ko 60 saal ke liye dilli hawaii saunp diya gaya
 On this investment, Dial has got a land of 24 thousand crore rupees and an opportunity to earn about 1 lakh 63 thousand 557 crore rupees
 yah baat dekhne laayak hogi ki kya draft reporton main kahi gai, ye sab baaten final report kaa hissaa hongi yaa nahin

 Hassan Ali, the country's largest tax defaulter, finally got caught in the trap of law
 mangalvaar ko use court main pesh kiya jayega
 He was questioned by the Enforcement Directorate for about six hours before his arrest
 somvaar ko hasan ali ke pune or mumbai ke ghar par chapa maaraa tha
 The locations of his associates in Delhi, Gurgaon, Kolkata and Hyderabad were also searched
 khabar he ki hasan ali ke arms dealer adnan khashhoggi se sambandhon kaa pataa chalaa he jo agar sabit ho gaye to us par behad sakht dharaaen lagaai ja sakati hai
 This arrest is important in the sense that the government has to answer on this issue in the Supreme Court today on the issue of black money
 guuruuvaar ko supreme court ne centre ko aade haathon lete hue poocha tha ki hasan ali ko castady main lekar poochtacha kyon nahin kii gai
 The government will tell the court today what it is doing to deal with criminals who have black money? purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ke sangh mukhyalay, nagpur main guuruuvaar ko jane se ek din pehle unki beti or congress netaa sharmishtha mukherjee ne unhen aagaah kiya tha
 Sharmishtha had warned her father about the effects of going to the Sangh headquarters
 sharmishtha ne twit main kaha tha, “bhaashan ko bhula diya jayega, tasviren sambhaal ke rakhi jaaengi
 By going to Nagpur, you are giving the BJP / RSS an open hand to spread false stories, rumors and make them somewhat credible! ”hope @ citiznmukherjeenow realises from todays' incident, how BJP dirty tricks dept operates
 Even RSS wouldn’t believe that u r going 2 endorse its views in ur speech
 But the speech will be forgotten, visuals will remain & those will be circulated with fake statements

 In this picture, Pranab Mukherjee was shown performing the 'flag Salutation' with a black cap on his head
 jaldi hi ye tasviir sharmishtha tak bhi pahunch gai
 Sharmishtha did not take any time to tweet again- 'see Papa, this is what i warned you about

 They also uploaded the original photo of Pranab Mukherjee during the program at Nagpur Sangh headquarters
 asli tasviir main jahaan pranab ke sir par topi nahin he or unke haath saavdhaan kii mudra main hai
 It is not difficult to find out that the picture in which Pranab is seen in the cap of the Sangh was fabricated from Photoshop
 nagpur ke kaarykram ko sabhi news channel par live telecast kiya gaya tha
 Newspapers also published reports with pictures of Pranab from every angle
 viral test ke liye hamane ye padtaal karne kaa faisla kiya ki sangh mukhyalay main pranab mukherjee kii photoshoped tasviir kaa mul strot kya tha? is tasviir ko gadhane ke peeche aakhir koun log the? sibrespes main gaharaai se jane par paaya gaya ki internet par is tasviir ko badi sankhya main share kiya gaya tha
 Some people who first shared it deleted it from their timeline
 isane hamaara shaq or gaharaa kiya
 Why did they delete it? agar unhone ise sabase pehle aplod kiya tha to phir wo isse apana kisi tarah kaa vaasta chupaane kyon lage? hamane do logon par focus kiya or unki delit kii gai post ko ritreave karne kii koshish kii
 Then soon the whole game came to light

 One such photo was chosen by Mihir Jha (@mihirkjha) and asked his friend @athiest_krishna on Twitter to put a black cap on Pranab's head in the picture
 donon twitor par ek duusare ko follow karte hai
 This is what was said on Twitter to @athiest_krishna- "brother @athiest_krishna can you put a black hat on their head and change the posture of their hands?" a friend has asked the Congress IT cell to do so
 ”vijag main rahane vaala @athiest_krishna nishchit rup se is trick ko karne ke liye sahi vyakti he
 On his Twitter profile, he himself claims that i photoshop photos for fun
 lekin @athiest_krishna kii ore se pranab kii tasviir par photoshop kii koshish kii jaati, isse pehle hi @mihirkjha ke ek or twitor mitra Abhi jha(@darrkeaage) ne ye kaam kar diya
 Abhi is also a friend of Mihir and Krishna
 teenon aapas main twitor par follow karte hai
 Abhi sent Mihir Kopranab Mukherjee's molested photo which is now being discussed everywhere
 phir mihir ne is tasviir ko twitor par aplod kiya or saath main daawa kiya ki kaarykram main maujuud rahe uske ek dost ne ye shandaar tasviir khinchi
 Now this post has also been deleted
 jab in teenon logon ke profiles kii padtaal kii gai to or bahut kuch dilachasp jaanane ko mila
 Mihir wrote on his Twitter profile - "proud to be followed by PM @ narendramodi
 ” hamane uske daawey kii sachai janani chaahi to dekha ki vastav main hi pradhanmantri narendra modi mihir ko follow kar rahe hai
 Her two other friends Abhi Jha (@darrkeaage) and Krishna (@atheist_krishna) are also very active on Twitter and they are followed by thousands more including BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya
 ham teenon tak pahunchane main safal rahe
 Krishna had no role in it so was found relaxed
 krishna ne maje ke liye tasveeron ko photoshop karne kii baat maani
 Some such photoshopped pictures of Krishna have also gone viral earlier
 haalanki krishna ne pranab kii uparokt tasviir se koi lenaa dena nahin bataaya
 Both Abhi and Mihir considered their role in the picture but at the same time said that there was no malice behind it and it was just for fun, so that no one is harmed
 photo keviral honaper or sharmishtha mukherjee ke is par coment karne par donon ghabara gaye
 Both claimed that they did not do so at the behest of any party or organization
 ye sirf cartoon ke jaise hi manoranjan ke liye tha
 This seed RSS has also described the picture as fake and malicious
 jaipur nagar nigam main bajet baithak ke dauraan jamkar hangaamaa hua
 Angered over the city's cleanliness system, an independent councilor Haji Nawab threw garbage on the cleaning committee chairman Roshan Saini
 iske baad roshan saini haji ke peeche bhaage or haji batch nikalne kii koshish main ek teble se ja takaraae
 After this, all the BJP councilors present there broke down on him and beat him in the house
 baari hangaame ke bich meyar jyoti khandelwal tamaasha dekhati raheen or ek hajaar 11 karod kaa bajet bina bahes ke paarit kar diya gaya
 After this Roshan Saini ran after Haji and Haji hit a table in an attempt to escape
 iske baad vahaan maujuud bijepi ke sabhi parshad un par tut pade or sadan main hi unki pitayee kar di
 Amidst the uproar, Mayor Jyoti Khandelwal continued to witness the spectacle and the budget of one thousand 11 crore was passed without debate
 in dinon dilli main yoga de kii dhooma he
 The biggest event is being held in Delhi i
e
 Connaught Place
 lekin usee conot place ke kone-kone main yuvaaon kii sehat ke saath sabase bada khilwaad ho rahaa he
 Or simply say that you will see the most intoxicated children of Delhi going under the influence of intoxication here
 jab 'aaj tak' kii team yoga de se ek din pehle conot place kaa chakkar laga rahi thi to vahiin kadam-kadam par nashe se jujhate yuva bhi najar aae
 While there is talk of healthy future everywhere on Yoga Day, many children are seen on the streets struggling with drugs
 lekin yahaan par bhi ek ummid kii kiran he or wo he ali
 Connaught Place is full of such children in Connaught Place, which is considered to be the heart of childhood deterioration and the heart of Ali's campaign
 yahaan nasha karne vaale zyaadaatar bacchon kii umr 10 saal se kam kii he or nasha inaki jindagi kaa ek maatr uddeshy ban gaya he
 Surprisingly, the Delhi government and the Delhi Police have not been able to take any concrete steps to rehabilitate such children yet, but Ali, who grew up on the same streets, on his own innocent shoulders, put children back into the mainstream Has pioneered si pi main rahgeeron ko phool bechate hue ali ko 3 saal ho chuke hai
 From Sector 62, Noida, he comes here every morning to sell flowers
 duusare hamaumr bacchon ko wo nasha karne se rokane ke liye har sambhav prayaas karata he
 He does not shy away from calling the destruction center and beating such children
 "ali ne mujhe nasha nahin karne ke liye bahut samajhaayaa he, wo mujhe peet bhi chukaa he or ab pichley do maheenon se maine nashe ko haath nahin lagaaya he
 Now i also join him and stop other children
 " ye kahana he dilashaad kaa jisaki umr 13 saal he or jisane ab ali ke kandhe se kandhaa milakar is muhim main haath bantane kaa faisla kiya he
 It is difficult to understand why the inexpensive business of open liquor in the capital of the country is not able to be implemented so far
 aisa nahin he ki nashe kaa kaarobaar sirf dilli kii sadakon tak simit he
 Most of the children and youth of middle class families are under the influence of drugs in Pahar Ganj, Anand Parbat and many areas of Old Delhi
 in sab ke bich sabase bada sawaal ye he ki aakhir wo koun sa kaaran he ki dilli sarkaar is ore aankh munde baithi he
 The streets of many big tourist spots have also become the base of drug, all the big red lights, temples, gurudwaras and tourist spots these children are begging or selling small items in the grip of cheap drugs
 inaki phikr na to inke parivaaravaalon ko he naa hi prashasan ko
 Whether traveling in the capital from around the world or the residents of Delhi are the means of earning for these children, and a part of the day's revenue is spent on buying intoxicants
 dilli main desh ke kone-kone se har varg ke log achche bhavishya kaa lekar aate hai
 Especially in Bihar, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, big wage laborers come to Delhi to search for Koroji Roti
 par yahaan in pariwaron ko suvidhaon ke abhaav main sadakon par apni jindagi gujaarni padati he or inamen se zyaadaatar pariwaron ke bachche sadakon par bheekh maangane ko majaboor hote hai
 In every major area of delhi, whether it is Rajendra Nagar, Karol Bagh, CP or India Gate, children begging at every red light are common for all the passers by the traffic police and it is common for them to get drunk

 inakam tex kii red ke baad aam aadmi party ke vidhayak kartaar singh par avaidh sampatti, jewelri or farm house hone ke sanket mili the
 The mla's office on Wednesday presented its explanation, keeping some papers in front
 saath hi inakam tex vibhaag ke ulat daawa kiya he ki kartaar singh ke paas avaidh sampatti nahin he
 According to MLA Kartar Singh's office, during the raids on July 27 and 28, income tax was given in writing that he did not have any undue assets
 daftar ne daawa kiya he ki avaidh sampatti ko lekar abhi tak inakam tex vibhaag ne red ke baad kuch bhi nahin poocha he or vidhayak kaa jabt phone bhi vaapis kar diya gaya he
 The information of the property given to the agency has also given the details of the cash amount seized from the mla's house after the income tax department's raid
 iske mutabik kartaar singh ke ghar se red ke dauraan kul nagad 11 lakh 25 hajaar 75 rupee jabt kiye gaye the
 According to Singh's close relatives, the mla's family owned hundreds of acres of pesticide land
 property kaa bantwarahone ke baad vidhayak ke paas jo sampatti he, usamen ab ek farm house he
 The office says that whatever property the family member has, information about income tax or the rest of the agency has been given
 jewelri ke laagat kii jaankaree nahiinakam tex kii red ke dauraan jabt kii gai jewelri par safai dete hue kartaar singh ke daftar ne kaha, 'jo jewelri jabt hui wo patni, beti or bahu kii jewelri he
 The MLA is not aware of the cost of the jewelery
 vidhayak ke daftar se mili kagajaat ke mutabik, kartaar singh 4 company main diarector hai, jabaki isse pehle wo 7 company main diarector rah chuke hai
 The office has admitted that one of these companies, VN Horticultures Private Limited, has the property of the MLA
 dilachasp he ki vidhayak par lage avaidh sampatti ke daag par aam aadmi party bayaan dene ke liye saamne nahin ai he
 MLA Kartar Singh himself appeared to avoid answering on camera questions
 haalanki sutara bataate hai ki party lagaataar vidhayak ke sampark main he or vidhayak puure maamle main kanoonee salaah bhi le rahe hai
 In the politics of UP, Shivpal Yadav has resigned from the post of minister in Akhilesh cabinet and all posts in Samajwadi Party, amidst the tension and tension of reconciliation
 unhone guuruuvaar der shaam mulaayam se mulaakaat ke baad siem akhilesh ko apana istipha saunpa
 However, Akhilesh Yadav has rejected his resignation as a minister
 akhilesh yadav ne shivpal se kaha he ki vah unhen mantrimandal se jane nahin denge
 But it is said that Shivpal is adamant
 is bich sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki shivpal ke bete aditya ne pradeshik ko-oparative federation se, jabaki unki patni sarala devi ne bhi sabhi padon se istipha de diya he
 Crowds of supporters outside the house, fierce slogans Meanwhile, a large crowd of supporters has gathered outside Shivpal's house
 wo naare laga rahe hai, 'shivpal tum aage badho, ham tumhaare saath hai
 Shivpal also came out of the house after midnight to meet the crowd
 unke ghar ke baahar 12 se adhikvidhayakamaujood hai
 Shivpal told the supporters, 'all of you are with us
 ham bhi aapke saath khadey hai
 It's been quite a night
 aap log ghar jaaie, soie or hamen bhi sone dijie
 'earlier on Thursday, a round of meetings took place from Delhi to Lucknow
 naaraazgi ke baad pehali baar shivpal yadav auzkhilesh yadavake bich bhi lakhanu main 15 minute kii mulaakaat hui
 Shivpal Yadav's resignation is a shocking move in the sense that his tone had softened after meeting elder brother Mulayam Singh in Delhi
 jiske baad shivpal ke saath hi khud mulaayam ne bhi yah kaha tha ki vah mantri pad se istipha nahin denge
 No formula was found to be useful
 It is also being said that Mulayam Singh used the formula of 'organization' and 'government' to save the SP from being torn apart
 iske tahat tay yah hua ki akhilesh yadav sapa kaa chunavi cheharaa honge or sarkaar unke hisaab se hi chalegi, jabaki shivpal party or sanghathan kaa kaamkaaj dekhenge
 But the confrontation and bitterness prevailed so much that Netaji's words were also ignored
 yakeenan, jo halaat saamne aae hai usase yahi baat samaj aa rahi he ki pehali baar samaajawaadee party main chijen mulaayam singh yadav kii pakad se bhi baahar ho chali hai
 These arrogance in the party before the UP elections certainly present a negative image
 lekin siem akhilesh ne kahin na kahin party ke saamne yah saaf kar diya he ki vah jhukne vaale nahin hai
 
 
 
 to kya tay he bantwaraupi kii siyasat main shivpal kii sanghathan ke netaa ke taur par majboot pakad maani jaati he
 However, Shivpal Yadav has also mentioned that Mulayam Singh will take the final decision and he will always work for the party, Mulayam Singh
 lekin jis tarah se bade beabaru hokar shivpal ne party pradesh adhyaksh or mantri pad se istipha diya he, jaahir he sapa ke liye aane vaala samay mushkilon bharaa hone vaala he
 Shivpal's silence after meeting Akhilesh was preceded by a meeting of uncle Shivpal Yadav with nephew CM at Five Kalidas Marg in the capital of the state
 jabaki baithak se nikalne par shivpal ne koi bayaan nahin diya
 Akhilesh reached his residence at Vikramaditya Marg late evening to meet Father Mulayam
 chachaa-bhattije ke bich jhagade ko nipataane mulaayam khaas taur par dilli se lakhanu pahunche hai
 The meeting between Akhilesh Yadav and his uncle Shivpal Yadav lasted for 15 minutes
 pichley dinon donon ke bich khulkar saamne ai tanatani ke baad ye pehali mulaakaat thi
 Uncle Ramgopal met Akhilesh Earlier on Thursday, his second uncle Ramgopal Yadav also met Akhilesh Yadav
 saifai se lakhanu pahunche ramgopal sang akhilesh kii yah baithak kareeb ek ghante lambii chali, vahiin shivpal yadav ne bhi dilli main mulaayam singh yadav se mulaakaat kii
 After meeting Akhilesh, Ram Gopal said without mentioning that only one person is bent on doing damage to the party
 unhone akhilesh ko party ke pradesh adhyaksh ke pad se hataae jane ko bhi galat tehraaya
 Ram Gopal Yadav, a teacher by profession, is currently a member of the Rajya Sabha from UP on a SP ticket
 ram gopal sapa ke rashtriya mahasachiv or pravaktaa ke pad par bhi hai
 The increased distance in the name of Amar Singh and Mukhtar Ansari makes good for Mulayam's cousin Ram Gopal, Akhilesh, while Akhilesh's relationship deteriorated four and a half years ago when he was made CM
 uske baad bhi kai aise maukey aae jab akhilesh or shivpal ke bich dooriyaan saaf dikhaai deen
 Be it the issue of Amar Singh's comeback or the merger of Bahubali Mukhtar Ansari's party with the Quami Ekta Dal
 aise badi takaraar or kadavaahatshivpal ne bade bhai mulaayam se milane ke baad kaha tha ki mulaayam bhi khush hai or wo bhi
 Fresh squabbles in Akhilesh and Shivpal began when Mulayam Singh appointed Shivpal Kopi SP president in place of Akhilesh
 akhilesh ne iske baad shivpal ke kareebi rahe do cabinet mantriyon or mukhya sachiv kii chuttee kar di
 Not only this, he also snatched many portfolios from Shivpal
 Democratic Party ke bahumat vaali america pratinidhi sabha ne raashtrapati donald trump kii seemaa par diwaar banane ke liye dhan ko manjuuri die bina aanshik rup se sarkari bandi khatm karne ke makasad se ek package paarit kiya he
 This has happened amid threats of a White House veto
 package ke seenet main aane par manjuur nahin hone kii ummid he, jisane congress ke democrate netaaon or prashasan ko ek gatirodh par chhod diya, jo aanshik bandi ko hal karne ke kareeb nahin najar aa rahaa
 It affected hundreds of thousands of federal employees who either went on leave or had to work without pay
 america news channel CNN ke mutabik america ke raashtrapati trump ne kaha he ki wo mexico seemaa par diwaar banane ke liye 5 arab dollar nahin dene vaale kisi bhi kadam ko sweekaar nahin karenge
 Newly elected House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said no funds would be provided for the wall
 guuruuvaar ko sadan main paarit pehle vidheyak ke paksh main 239 mat pade, jabaki vipaksh main 192 mat pade
 The proposal was to continue funding to the Department of Homeland Security, which would not allocate spending for the construction of any new walls
 vidheyak ko manjuuri dene ke liye democrate netaaon ke saath 5 republican netaa bhi shaamil hue
 Then the House voted for 6 agencies, with 241 votes in favor and 190 in opposition
 isamen rajya ke vibhaag- vaanijya, krishi, shram, tregeri or anya agenciyon ke liye raashi shaamil he
 News agency IANS reported that Democrat leaders say Kidnald was disrupting government funding for Trumpdivar, which these leaders found unnecessary and ineffective
 ab donon dalon ke congress netaaon ke white house main bajet par charchaa ke ek or daur ke liye raashtrapati trump se milane kii ummid he
 The Senate, which has a majority of Republican leaders, said it cannot vote on the bill
 seenetke bahumat ke netaa mitch mcconil ne kaha ki republican us kadam kaa samarthan nahin karenge, jiskaa samarthan trump nahin karte
 He described the move of the Democratic Party as politically motivated and pretense
 saamaajik taana bana samajhnaa kisi ke liye bhi aasaan nahin he, lekin is jatilta ko bhi asagar vajahat ne bahut acchhee tarah na sirf samajha he balki use bayaan karne kaa shilp bhi kamaal kaa he
 These words belong to the noted litterateur Sarveshwar Dayal Saxena, who told the stories of Asghar Wajahat after reading them
 saamaajik or saanskrithik chintaaon se upja asagar vajahat kaa lekhan kisi bhi kasuti par khara utar chukaa he or tamaam aalochakon ne vakt vakt par isi baat par muhar bhi lagaai he
 Asghar Wajahat is named among those writers who are convinced that the role of literature is important to make this beautiful world better and their own testimony to this fact is that Asghar Wajahat's book 'cleaning dirty The work has come forward
 dilli vishvavidhyalay ke indraprastha college main guuruuvaar ko asagar vajahat kii duusari pustak kaa vimochan hua
 As part of the inaugural program organized by the book's publisher Rajpal & Sons, Asghar also met students interested in Wajahat literature and especially literature showing the true picture of the new age
 is dauraan unhone unke kai sawaalon ke jawaab thik usee andaaj main die, jaisaa wo apni lekhnee ke jariye pathakon kaa aamanaa saamana karte hai
 The author has divided the book 'safai Dirty Kama Hai' into three major sections
 saamaajik rajnatik or sahitya kala
 The motive is clear that if anything is said or heard about the three things that affect the most in the life of the common Indian in this country, then this can be the most appropriate and scientific way to reach the address point
 Where a writer wants to convey his point
 
 
 
 That we are in Mughalate In this collection, the author has drawn attention to the things spread in our society, about which we all have taken some pride according to our convenience
 ye maan liya gaya he ki shaayad duniya main ham sabase shreshth ban gaye hai or usamen kisi bhi tarah ke sanshodhan kii gunjaaish nahin he
 But the author has made his point through small but big interesting stories and stories in such a way that the matter goes deep in the heart and then it is realized that how much we all want to live life in a different way trying
 jabaki jindagi kaa dayera to bahut bada he, jiske liye hamen duniya ke kai mulkon main faili sabhyataa or vahaan ke saanskrithik taana bana se seekhney kii jarurat he
 In real sense, Asghar Wajahat has presented evidence of the author being a watchman of culture in real life, who not only warns about the dangers, but also completes the culture in his own way
 agar is sangrah main samaaj kii asli chintaaon kaa zikr he to wo sawaal bhi hai, jo bhartiya samaaj main majahab ke naam par chubh rahe hai
 It can be said from India or even that those who love their country must read this book at once, because the sharp words of simple words have the potential to show the depth of thoughts by ripping off the deep fog of pride

 Justice Kurian has asked, "will a wise man leave the keys of his vault to a servant whose loyalty is doubtful?" Justice Kurien said that it would not be inconsistent to mention that a person with dubious allegiance is not appointed to an important part of governance whose job is to interpret the law and deliver justice, then why talk about dubious allegiance
 unhone kaha ki aapraadhik maamle main mukademe kaa saamana kar rahe kisi pratyaashee ko uski kathith aapraadhik prishthbhumi ke kaaran civil seva main bhi niyukt nahin kiya jaataa he

 is vakt bijepi main sabase badi bahes is baat kii he ki kya narendra modi ko bataur pradhanmantri ghoshit kiya jaae yaa phir colective leadership ke tahat aage chunaav ladaa jaae
 What do you believe? The kind of economic and cultural conditions that exist in the country at this time, it requires experienced hands
 meraa maananaa he ki laalkrishna adwani pradhanmantri rahen or narendra modi or rajnath kisi cabinet ministar ke naate haath aajamaayen
 They make themselves perfect with experiences
 yahi desh ke liye thik hoga
 But many people will say that there is a demand for Narendra Modi at this time? The question is not of demand but of country interest
 adwani ji swasth hai, anbhavi hai, sabase senior hai, sabhi ko saath lekar chalane kii kshamta ve pramanit kar chuke hai
 Narendra Modi has a lot to learn
 unako itani jaldi kharch nahin karnaa chahie

 It is also bound to raise the question of seeing huge crowds in rallies or movements organized in support of the demand for reservation, because of the vested interests, such a large number of people have gathered or political ambitions filled with political ambitions "managed" to pull them
 Huh? Or is this huge gathering of unemployed youth a result of their spontaneous support for the demand for reservation? It may be easy to raise such questions, but it can be difficult to answer them directly in "yes" or "no"

 maharashtra vidhansabha ne maratha samudaay ke liye 16 fisadi naukariyaan arakshit karne kii khatir maratha aarakshan vidheyak paarit kiya tha, par hycourt ne us par roak laga di
 The question is, why are these demands arising after so many years of independence and why are the economically prosperous and politically dominated castes demanding reservation for themselves in their respective states? Jats, Marathas, Gurjars and Patel The argument against reservation for castes is that these castes do not need reservation, because they are not only educationally and economically prosperous, but they Ajnatik domination is achieved
 aksar hota yah he ki samooche samudaay ke bare main is kism kii atiranjit baaten bagaiyr kisi saboot ke kahi jaati hai or in samudaayon ke do-chaar kaamyaab logon kii misaal bhi nahin di jaati
 There is no doubt that some people of these castes have risen high financially, educationally and politically, but the number of such successful people is very less

 When good prices of agricultural produce were available, these other backward castes rarely felt the scarcity of money and rarely cared about going to government jobs and therefore rarely paid attention to the demand for reservation

 This is the reason that there has been a surge in the movements for reservation recently

 bharat main aazaadee ke chah dashakon se zyada vakt ke baad bhi tamaam jati samudaayon ke bheetar aarakshan kii niti ke haq main samarthan maujuud he
 If you feel that there is not enough evidence to support the policy of heavy crowd reservation, then there is another proof
 2014 main vikasshil samaaj adhyayan centre ne bharatiyon ke vibhinn tabakon ke bich ek survey kiya tha, jiskaa ek nateeja yah tha ki bahumat bhartiya shaikshik sansthaaon or sarkari naukariyon main aarakshan kii niti kaa samarthan karte hai
 While only 12 percent people were against it
 yah sahi he ki ucch yaa savarna jatiyon main yah samarthan thodaa kam tha, lekin yah maananaa bhi galat hoga ki savarna jatiyaan aarakshan kii maangon ke khilaaf hai

 What a regrettable coincidence aath saal pehle jisane mumbai ko sabase bada zakhm dipha, aath saal baad usee kaatil kaa hisaab karne kii bajaae pakistan use azaadi kaa jashn manaane or kek kaatane kaa mauka detaa he
 26-11 is the date of eight years ago, which is restless with sorrow and sorrow
 ye din mumbai kii ankhon main tehre hue aansu kii tarah lagata he
 Shameless Pakistani governments will come out of tears when Mumbai's biggest criminal Hafiz Saeed comes to an end
 magar lashkar-e-taiyaba ke mukhibia hafiz said kaa hisaab karne kii bajaae pakistani sarkaar ne puri besharmi ke saath das maheene kii nazarbandi ke baad 26-11 ke sabase bade gunahagaar ko 23-11 ko reeha kar diya
 The terrorist is celebrating what Saeed has gone through eighty years ago, but the sorrow with which Mumbai has passed is still a part of his life
 26-11 kii mumbai ko jin hazaron ankhon ne dekha wo lagaataar aapke saamne tha
 This was the first time when a volley of bullets came from an openly moving vehicle
 railway stesan, aspataal or hotalon main gole or goliyaan chalin or log keede makaadon kii tarah bichhate chale gaye
 i wish it was a lie
 magar afsos ki jo hua na wo jhooth tha or naa hi ye jhooth he ki is katleam kaa sabase bada kaatil aaj aath saal baad bhi naa sirf azaad he balki apni azaadi kaa baqayada jashn manaa rahaa he
 At midnight, Azadwo, a million-million-dollar terrorist Hafiz Saeed, is absolutely free
 kya kijiega
 He lives in Pakistan, so everything is possible
 uski azaadi bhi
 Photographs that surfaced after his release on the night of 23 November showed how terrorist Hafiz Saeed is celebrating his release in Lahore
 isi saal janvari main chautarafa dabaav ke baad pakistani hukumat ne said ko usee ke ghar main nazarband kar diya tha
 But 10 months after the detention, Hafiz Saeed left at midnight on 23 November
 phir subah hote hi wo apane aatanki sanghathan jamaat-ud-daawa ke headquarter pahunchaa
 Celebration was done by distributing sweets
 kek kaata gaya
 After that, the leader of lashkar-e-taiba started shouting slogans for the destruction of India
 paak sarkaar ne chhipaae sabutahindustan ke na jane kitne hi shaharon ke saath shahar mumbai ke is sabase bade dushman ko aise reeha karne kii besharmi sirf pakistan hi kar saktaa he
 It is the Pakistani government, which sat down to suppress all the evidence submitted by India against Hafiz Saeed
 uske khilaaf court main ek bhi saboot pesh nahin kisia
 However, in order to show the world, it has been a fraud in front of the court that the release of Hafiz Saeed will increase the difficulties of Pakistan
 isliye use naa choda jaae
 But when the court turned around and asked for evidence against Saeed, the government would have been silent
 bharat ke khilaaf phir sajeeshpakistani sarkaar kii meharbaani se hafiz said ek baahar phir aaazaad ho chukaa he
 Obviously, in return for this freedom, he will try to please the Pakistani government, army and ISI
 to rihaai milte hi usne iskaa elaan bhi kar diya
 He spoke bitter as soon as he got free
 ise sirf hafiz said ke bol na maane
 These are the lyrics of Pakistan
 jisane hafiz said jaise aatankwaadi ko choda hi isiilie ki bharat ke khilaaf aatank kii phul supplai kii jaae
 Expanding the old terrorist agenda, who would be such a terrorist country in the world, which sits on the shoulders of international terrorists
 khuleam duusare desh ke khilaaf zehar ugalane kii ijaajat detaa he
 Allows to threaten to spread terror
 hafiz said ne chhootane ke baad phir yahi shuru kar diya
 Actually, the threat that Hafiz Saeed is giving is not his threats but the threats of Pakistan
 jo ab besharmi se duniya ko bataa rahaa he ki wo international aatankwaadiyon ko paalataa he
 The world will not be able to harm him
 aatanki kal bhi khuleam reliyaan karte the
 Even today they are openly threatening terrorists jihad
 zaahir he ise choda hi isiilie gaya he
 By releasing Hafiz Saeed, Pakistan also wants to speed up its old terrorist agenda in Kashmir
 pakistan phir benakabaye teesraa mauka he jab pakistan ne hafiz said ko reeha kiya he
 He was arrested on two separate occasions due to pressure from India following the 26 / 11 Mumbai attack
 magar donon hi baar kuch dinon baad use reeha kar diya gaya
 He was placed under house arrest in Jauhar Town in Lahore after being detained for the third time in January this year
 yani said ko jail nahin bheja gaya tha
 Rather it was kept comfortably in his house
 is aatanki kii rihaai ne ek baar phir pakistan kaa cheharaa benakaab kar diya he

 is baat se niraash hokar sati apane pita ke paas jawaab lene gai ki unhone shiv ji ko yajna main nimantrit kyon nahin bheja
 On this matter King Daksha strongly condemned Sati and Lord Shiva
 sati bahut roi, unase apane pati kaa apmaan nahin dekha gaya or unhone usee yajna main khud ko bhasma kar diya
 Hearing the news of Sati's death, Lord Shiva himself created Veerabhadra and caused the demolition of the yagya through him

 In the last Lok Sabha election, out of 17 seats, Samajwadi Party had grabbed 9 seats, 6 seats went to BSP account and one seat was won by BJP
 azamgarh pahunch kar basapa adhyaksh mayawati ne aatankwaad kaa mudda uthaaya
 In his rally in Mulayam Singh Yadav's constituency, he said that ever since the BJP government has come, Muslims are being hunted in the name of terrorism and are being oppressed in the name of love jihad and cow protection
 mayawati ne har hafte ek mahareli karne kaa silsilaa shuru kiya he
 Last Sunday was the first rally in Agra and today is the second rally in this regard in Azamgarh
 mayawati jis ilaake main logon se mukhaatib thim, vahaan takreeban har chauthaa shaks musalmaan he or apane jile pe dehshatgardi kaa tag lagane se naaraaz he
 It is true that addresses of many people from Ahmedabad blasts to Delhi blasts, and from Indian Mujahideen to ISIS are found here
 lekin yah bhi sach he ki yah caphi aazmi, rahul sankrutyaayan or almmaa shibli naumani kii bhi sarazamiin he
 But today he is less remembered, so today the Muslims here are restless
 mayawati ne unki dukhati rag chune kii koshish kii or kaha 'jab se modi sarkaar ai he musalmaan dehshat main he
 They are being treated half-way
 puure pradesh main sampradayik takaton ke majboot hone se lav jihad, goraksha, hindu raashtra ke naam par musalamaanon kaa shoshan ho rahaa he
 In the name of terrorism, Muslims are being viewed with suspicion which our party opposes
 ' In an hour-long speech, Mayawati attacked Modi and BJP for thirty-five hours
 kehete hai ki vah sabase zyada bijepi se ladati hui dikhnaa chaahati hai taaki musalmaan vot khinch saken
 He has given more than 100 tickets to Muslims
 yahi nahin, azamgarh kii 10 main se 6 siton par apane ummidavaar kaa elaan kar chuki hai jinamein se 3 musalmaan hai
 He attacked the Modi government for the Lalit Modi scandal, the Mallya scandal, the debt waiver of the capitalists, the recruitment of RSS people in government institutions
 mayawati ne bispi se nikle logon ke bijepi main jane par kaha 'bijepi kii haalat to itani zyada kharaab he ki ab yah party bispi ke rejected maal ko bhi lene main sharmaati nahin or unke gale main amit shah patta pahanaate hai
 The BJP people are also playing disgusting tricks to dent the Dalit vote
 ' tippaniyan Mayawati raised the issue of backwardness of Purvanchal and clarified that the slogan 'tilak scales and Talwar' was not hers
 vah oonchi jati ke saath hai
 He enumerated Muzaffarnagar, Dadri, Mathura and Bulandshahr incidents and accused the state government of anarchy and casteism
 bispi chhodane ke mudde par kaha 'yah log prachaar kar rahe hai ki bispi main bhagdad machi he
 They are also saying that tickets are being sold
 main poochna chaahati hum ki jab bispi main bhagdad machi he to phir aisi kharaab haalat main is party kaa tikat koun kharid rahaa he
 ' san 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ne mayawati se upi kii satta chin lee or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ne unhen yahaan ek bhi seat nahin di
 Now the 2017 assembly elections are a battle of do or die for her, for which she has left the field
 ab 4 sitambar ko unki teesri raily elahabaad main hogi
 Nearly every fourth person is a Muslim in the area where Mayawati was known to the people, and is angry with the tag of terror in her district
 yah sahi he ki ahmedabad dhamaakon se dilli dhamaakon tak, or indian mujahiddeen se iesas tak se jude kai logon ke pate yaheen milte hai
 But it is also true that this is also the case of Kaifi Azmi, Rahul Sankrityayan and Alma Shibli Naumani
 lekin aaj vah kam yaad kiye jate hai isliye aaj yahaan kaa musalmaan baichaiyn he
 Mayawati tried to touch his pain and said, 'muslims have been in panic ever since the Modi government has come
 unke saath sautela bartaav ho rahaa he
 Due to the strengthening of the communal forces in the entire state, Muslims are being exploited in the name of love jihad, cow protection, Hindu nation
 aatankwaad ke naam par musalmaan ko shaq kii nazar se dekha ja rahaa he jiskaa hamaari party virodh karti he
 ' mayawati ne kareeb ghante bhar lambey bhaashan main puure poun ghante modi or bijepi par hamale kiye
 It is said that she wants to be seen fighting the BJP the most so that Muslims can draw votes
 unhone 100 se zyada tikat musalamaanon ko de die hai
 Not only this, she has announced her candidate in 6 out of 10 seats in Azamgarh, out of which 3 are Muslims
 unhone lalit modi cond, maalya cond, puunjipatiyon kii karj maafee, sarkari sansthaaon main aresas ke logon kii bhartee ke liye modi sarkaar par hamale kiye
 Mayawati said that when the people of BSP went to BJP, the condition of BJP was so bad that now this party is not ashamed to take even the rejected goods of BSP and wear Amit Shah strap around their neck
 dalit vot ke liye send lagane ke liye bhi bijepi ke log ghinauni chaal chal rahe hai
 Comments mayawati ne purvanchal ke pichhadepan kaa mudda uthaaya or safai di ki 'tilak taraazoo or talwaar' vaala naaraa unka nahin tha
 He belongs to the upper caste
 unhone mujffarnagar, dadri, mathura or bulandshahr cond ginaae or pradesh sarkaar par araajaktaa or jatvaad kaa ilzaam lagaaya
 On the issue of leaving the BSP, he said, "these people are campaigning that there is a stampede in the BSP
" yah bhi kah rahe hai ki tikat beche ja rahe hai
 i want to ask who is buying the ticket for this party in such a bad condition when there is a stampede in the BSP
 ' The 2012 assembly elections wrested up's power from Mayawati and the 2014 Lok Sabha elections did not give her a single seat here
 ab 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav unke liye karo yaa maro kii jang he jiske liye vah maidan main nikal padi hai
 Now on September 4, his third rally will be held in Allahabad

 abhi tak kuch spasht nahin dikh rahaa
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi announced that he will also contest from Wayanad, the hill seat of the state
 iske baad bhaajapa or vampanthi dalon kii tikhi pratikriya saamne ai lekin jald hi us bahes par dhul jam gai or kerala waapas rajnatik dalon se buniyadi sawaal poochne laga he
 Till now there was a direct fight between the CPI (M) -led LDF and the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) (in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the LDF won eight seats and the UDF won 12 seats) but this time the BJP If making its presence, then a third angle is expected to open in the competition
 haalanki bhaajapa kuch hi nirvachan kshetron main chunauti detii najar aegi phir bhi itnaa spasht he ki vah donon hi morchon ke vot bank main send lagane ko taiyaar he
 The LDF Pinarayi Vijayan is looking to win elections on the government's record of good governance, while trying to avoid protests over women's entry into the Sabarimala temple and controversies over the reconstruction of Kerala after the floods

 Taking into account the social equations, the political unit of the Nadar community, Vaikunthaswamy Dharma Pracharna Sabha and Nadar Seva Society were also together which till now were the sympathies of the Congress
 kayaas hai ki yah gathjod tiruvanantpuram seat par sabase asardaar rah saktaa he jise bhaajapa ne 2014 main shashi tharur (congress) se lagbhag chin hi liya tha
 This time, RSS veteran Kummanam Rajasekharan from Thiruvananthapuram has fielded from BJP
 bhaajapa ne baaji sahi bichaai he, lekin agar sabarimala vivaad ke baad bhi vah yah seat jeetne main naakaam rahi, to uskaa bhavishya ujjwal nahin ho saktaa

 On the eve of the 2015 Cricket World Cup semi-final against New Zealand, d'villiers is fully confident
 isse pehle donon hi timen kabhi worldcup ke final main nahin pahunchi hai
 d'villiers said, 'we are full of confidence
 mujhe lagata he ki team kaaphi achche samay par kaaphi acchhee lay main he
 There are many reasons to be full of confidence
 ’ di’williarsunhone kaha, ‘agar ham apni puri kshamta se khelte hai to is toornament main hamen koi nahin roak saktaa
 The three-odi series between the two teams was won by South Africa 2–0 at the start of summer in New Zealand, but the New Zealand team was successful in the warm-up match before the start of the World Cup

 rashtriya swayan sevak sangh 19 may ko aakhri charan ke voting ke baad agle din 20 may ko apana feedback bhaajapa ke saath saajha karegaa
 Based on this feedback, the consortium will decide the 3 track strategy
 sangh sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik 6 charnon kii voting ke baad sangh ko jo feedback mila he vah bhaajapa ko mili feedback se mail nahin kha rahaa he
 While the BJP is claiming in its feedback that this time the party will win more than 282 seats in 2014, the Sangh estimates that the BJP is losing a large number of seats compared to 2014
 sangh ne 2014 or 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav aankadon kaa vishleshan kiya he
 According to this, in 2014, the BJP won 282 seats out of which the margin of victory in 239 seats was less than the vote of the third candidate
 masalan pehle number par rahete hue bhaajapa ne 100 vot hasil kiye or tisare number par rahete hue kisi dal ne 40 vot hasil kiye to duusare number par rahe pratyaashiyon ko 60 se adhik vot hasil hue
 In this context, the alliance of opposition parties in 239 seats and where there is a direct competition from Congress or other parties, it is more likely that the seat will be out of the hands of BJP
 aise main teen vikalp ko lekar sangh manthan kar rahaa he
 Under the first option, try to have regional parties in their ranks to form the NDA government under Modi's leadership
 is kaam ko karne ke liye kisi varisht netaa ko jimmedaari saunpane kaa suzav sangh de saktaa he
 As option two, if the other parties do not agree to come, in that case the Sangh can persuade Modi and Shah to hand over the leadership to another leader of the party
 modi or shah ko raji karne ke liye sangh ke sar kaarywah bhaiyaji joshi ko jimmedaari di ja sakati he
 As a third option, the Sangh will try to persuade Modi and Shah that if there is no option left other than to sit in the opposition, then the leader replaces Modi and Shah as the Opposition and the party's national president
 Assign responsibility to another leader
 *** You must have heard the saying of a pomegranate hundred sick people

 The BJP has written a letter written by Archbishop Anil Cueto of Delhi criticizing his government
 is chitthee main likhaa tha, desh main ''kalahpurn rajnatik vaataavaran he, jo loktantric mulyon
 
 or raashtra ke dharmanirpeksh taane-bane ke liye khatra he
 "home Minister Rajnath Singh admitted that he had not seen the letter but assured people that" India is one of the countries where minorities are safe and no one is allowed to discriminate on the basis of caste and religion
 is
 ''alpsankhyak maamalon ke mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi kaa kahana tha ki ghatnaon ko pakshpatpurna najaron se dekha gaya he
 He said, "we should see that the Prime Minister is committed to development without any discrimination
" jab tak aap purvaagrah se grast honge tab tak aapako yah pragati dikhaai nahin degi

 Due to so much hue and cry on this letter, Cueto had to speak that his letter was not political but an attempt to give religious sermons
 archbishap or unke sachiv fadar robinsan, donon kah chuke hai ki unka iraadaa kisi rajnatik party yaa sarkaar kii aalochana karnaa nahin tha
 Is the BJP so lost that it does not see a "threat to the secular fabric of the country" in the words of Cueto

 a second Congress leader in Goa, Savio Rodríguez, tweeted that the media should show "this communal statement of the Delhi Archbishop" in response to this letter
 rodrigs ne kaha, ''kya unka matlab he ki 'hindu takaton ko parajeet karo'
 Do they want to say that Hindus are bad for India? ”the Archbishop's letter does not mention Hindus or so-called Hindu forces anywhere

 What about his hold on Bundeli? When he grew up in the same area, in his writing, he gave this dialect a linguistic basis, but while writing, he moves equally easily in 'dhirasamire' in Brajbhasha and 'house of Five Courts' and banarasi-bhojpuri in 'pagla Baba'
 
 samakaleen katha-sahitya main unki apni alag pahchaan he - ek aisi upasthiti jo ek sampoorn sahityakar kaa bodh karaati he, jisaki variyataon main lekhan sarvopari he, jisaki chintaayen samakaleen samaaj se uthakar ‘prithvi par manushya’ ke rahane ke sandarbh tak jaati hai or jiskaa lekhan-falak ‘laal pili zamin’ ke khurdare yatharth, ‘tumhaari roshni main’ kii komalta or kaavyatmakataa, ‘dhirasamire’ kii bhartiya parampara kii khoj, ‘hujur darbar’ or ‘paanch aanganonvala ghar’ kii itihaas or ateet ke sandarbh main aaj ke prashnon kii padtaal- ko ek saath samete hue he
 Govind Mishra attributes this to his openness
 bahut kam sahityakar aise hai jinaki ‘range’ itani vyapak he or jinke srujit paatro kii sankhya bhi hazaar se upar he
 On one hand, in his stories, the village of 'kachakondh' is the master of the village, while a modern character like 'michael Lobo' or the foreign Maria of 'khak History'
 govind mishra kii prakashit kritiyon main upanyaas: vah / apana cheharaa, utarati hui dhoop, laal pili zamin, hujur darbar, tumhaari roshni main, dhirasamire, paanch aanganonvala ghar, phool
 
 
 Buildings and monkeys, incarceration in fog, dust on plants, austerentry; Storytelling: above ten; Last five - Pagla Baba, the sky
 
 
 kitna nila, hawaabaz, mujhe baahar nikaalo, naye sire se; sampoorn kahaniyaan: nirjharini (do khand) aadi shaamil hai
 Also the journey: misty headlines, across the gates
 
 
 shaam, jhulati jaden, paraton ke bich; nibandh: sahitya kaa sandarbh, katha bhoomi, samvaad anayas, samay or sarjana, sahitya, sahityakar or prem, saannnidhya sahityakar; kavita: o prakruti maan!; bal-sahitya: master mansukhram, kavi ke ghar main chor, aadmi kaa jaanavar; samgr yatra-vrutt: rangon kii gandh (do khand), chuni hui kavitaayen (teen khand) aadi prakashit hai
 His importance in the Hindi literature world can be gauged from the fact that he received the Sahitya Akademi Award, Saraswati Samman, Vyas Samman, Subramanya Bharathi Samman, Uttar Pradesh Hindi Sansthan, Indian Language Council, Kolkata Samman, Arthurs Guild of India, on his works
 Has been awarded with Premchand Award etc
 kareeb-kareeb amanviya or jad hota jaataa sansar govind mishra ke lekhan kii mukhya chintaaon main se he, jahaan ve ek parivesh kaa keval bhitari-bahari kaccha chittha-bhar prastut karte hai, vahaan bhi sarjanaatmak vyathaa maanviyata or mulyon ke na hone kii hi hoti he
 The basic tone of Govind Mishra's writing is positive, which has become increasingly clear in his compositions
 'vah apana cheharaa’ ek talash he jo chehron se shuru hokar jivan-paddati evam manyataon se hoti hui naitikta or mulyon tak jaati he, naukarshahi kaa parivesh, daftari maansikta, filon-imaaraton kii duniya yahan ek aise tanaav ke madhyam se ubhaare gaye hai jo jitna ugr he, utana hi phijul-lalaphitaashahee ke apane swabhaav kii tarah
 Here the faces are also rotating like files, 'his' face becomes 'he', the one against whom he was fighting
 charitron kii gahari pakad, kalaatmakataa or bhashaa kaa ek apane dhang kaa khurdurapan is upanyaas ko vishisht banaate hai
 Today on Govind Mishra's birthday, read the literature on Aaj Tak, his novel He Apna Apna Ke Adhaar Bhaag: He was empty of his facial office because it was five and a half, and the government offices started coming out of the bus a little before time
 To stand forward in cue
 lift bhi band the, isliye seedhiyaan pakadani padin
 i thought i should ask Amaru- 'she will meet at this time too, did you call or not?' But i was panting then and he was ahead of me because of his long legs
 peeche se pukaarane kaa meraa man nahin tha
 
 
 Then he will go up at all costs to see, so i could just drag him behind, right now
 rachana apane kamare main nahin thi
 Keshav Das was sitting there
 hamaare vibhaag kaa ek mahatvapurn afasar
 Age beyond fifty six
 jitna vajandaar pad utana hi baari-bharkam sharir
 She was a saddle of a long and wide Pathan
 
 
 
 It would have looked attractive if tight
 fasar-fasar tha
 
 
 a loose bundle like a thick bundle
 
 
 kuch idhar nikalataa, kuch udhar bahata hua
 
 
 Almost awful
 ham donon hi use jaanate the
 i was very close, but at that place, i found myself as stranger, lying on the sloping table on top of the papers
 ham jaanate the ki vah secreterriott ke mukhya bhawan main baithta tha or uske tab vahaan hone kii kalpana hamane nahin kii thi
 There were definitely some flying stories - composition and its relations were said to be very close
 rachana ko har umdaa tainaati vakt se pehle hi milti chali gai thi
 
 
 The secret behind this was said to be related to Keshavdas
 maine un baton ko kuch bebuniyaad khabaron se zyada tarjeeh nahin di thi kyonki jis bhawan main ham kaam karte the vahaan khabaren bas aise hi ud jaaya karti thim! ve kahan se uthati thim yaa ki ud baithti thim bas, aise hi- yah koi nahin jaanata tha
 Later, i was estranged from those anecdotes by thinking 'what if it was me' - my relationship with Keshavdas was irrespective of the composition and to the extent he was
 rachana se mere sambandh sirf nammaatr ke rah gaye the
 Descending from 'friend' was left to 'acquaintance' and i did not want to spoil them any more
 
 
 amaru hichakaa, baahar aayaa, rachana kaa naam usne phir board par padhaa or kuch achakachaakar meri taraf dekhne laga
 ''come
 
 
 aaie
 
 
 "keshavdas had seen us and called us from behind as soon as we were about to run away
 uski jagah koi or hota to jarur hichkichaya hota us sthiti main, taalane kii koshish karata or bahut sambhav tha, ham thodi idhar-udhar taak-jhaank kar chale bhi gaye hote
 But Keshavdas was not like this, i knew it
 vah us tarah ke sabhy-sabhy vyavhaar ke liye kuch zyada hi akkhad tha
 "what a creation
" 
 ? "amaru agreed, i remained behind
 ''baithiye, ve abhi aati hai
 
 
 "we sat down
 keshavadas apane kaagajon par jhuk gaya, jab-kab meri taraf dekh baithta tha, kaagajon se sir uthaakar
 Then i felt as if he did not look, stare - as if he caught me doing something wrong
 unheen najaron se vah baat ko saadhaaran-si baat kii tarah taalata bhi dikhataa usee kshan
 He did not know Amaru, i introduced him
 haath milaane ke baad keshavadas ne ek cigarette sulagaa lee or apana gold-flake kaa packet meri taraf bhi badha diya
 "thanks, i have
" 
 
 "''yahan aap meri pijie
 "he looked at my packet of wills with such a keen eye that i thought i was meeting him for the first time
 uske saath meri itane dinon kii anaupchaarik ghanishthata ek phunk main bah gai thi
 He was so formal in his office that there was more talk
 rachana ke kamare main vah is tarah kaa kya dikhaata he
 
 
 Throwing his packet of cigarettes in a way that looked good in his house was going on
 
 
 par tab main kuch or sochane lag gaya- ki chizon kaa str, unka daam anayas hi baitha jaataa he, varanaa main acchhee tarah jaanata hoon ki kam-se-kam cigareton main har kii apni jagah he
 In Charminar, there is a special kind of pungency, in which the feeling of sharpness of intellectuals and revolutionaries is also automatically hidden, yet people associate it with starvation and unemployment
 
 
 vah shaayad yah jataana chahta tha ki vah hamase bada afasar he
 "I am writing a chapter of the Reforms Commission" which belongs to this department
 
 
 "vah amaru ko bataane laga
 It is not known whether he was giving reason for his presence there or was busy in making his attack
 ''is vibhaag ke afasar kii sthiti jaal main fasi makadi-jaisi he- is taraf public, idhar uskaa staff use hameshaa tangdi maar dene ke chakkar main, idhar si
 B
 ai
 Looking at everything in doubt, the commissioner here - hoping for a special blessing
 
 
 idhar se board us par hidaayaten par hidaayaten ladata hua
 
 
 "he was making a blueprint on a paper
 maine dekha uski likhaawat choti or kaaphi gichapich thi, likhaawat se uske baari-bharkam sharir kaa andaja lag saktaa tha
 i remembered my first co-operative who had drawn my blueprint just before seeing my signature
 shaayad mote log apane sharir se akraant rahete honge, isliye hameshaa chota likhte honge- gichapich
 He was not a trickster
 
 
 maine koshish chhod di, kya pataa vah bas yon hi khinche ja rahaa ho yaa sachmuch apane adhyay ke bare main soch rahaa ho
 His fingers shivered
 
 It was strange that i had never noticed this before
 
 
 ho saktaa he aaj ve zyada hi kaanp rahi hon, isliye mujhe alag dikhaai de rahi hon
 She was shaking, and more while smoking cigarettes
 
 
 ek ajeeb dhang se
 
 
 Like Parkinson's disease shakes the patient
 isse uske ird-gird ek bhaddaapan failata tha
 i started getting bored, looked at Amaru
 amaru use kuch muskaraate hue, kuch prashansa-bhav se dekhe ja rahaa tha, pehali mulaakaat main hi prabhavit kar jane ke chakkar main hoga! aise poj main main bhi amaru-jaisaa hi murkh dikhataa hoonga, par yah hamaare yahan kaa aam 'poj’ he
 
 
 
 rachana ko kamare main ghuste hue sabase pehle maine dekha kyonki main hi idhar baitha tha or philhal unki baton se tatasth tha
 She entered in a very natural way, but seeing us there, she suddenly stopped
 tabhi uske chehre par ek kaalikh daud gai
 
 
 It would be fine to say soot - light ink - in a very clear way, it made the face foggy and went on spreading throughout the face
 amaru ne bhi dekha hoga
 The composition also appeared a little conscious of that soot
 
 
 tabhi vah jaldi hi ek 'halo’ hamaari taraf uchhaalkar mere bagal main padi ek khaali kursi par baith gai
 When standing, she would be seen more intently, she wanted to become a part of the atmosphere already laid in the room
 ''main aapke mehmaanon ko roke rahaa, aapako dhanyavad to dena chahie
 "keshavdas said to Rachna
 ''thanks
 "we all laughed, drawing-roomed laughter
 pataa nahin vah vyangy tha yaa sirf vah jo lagata tha
 Then Keshav Das went ahead, Amaru was listening very carefully to him in the past
 mujhe uski baton main koi aisi khaasiyat nahin najar aa rahi thi
 i found the composition very small then
 maine use pehle kabhi is tarah sikuda hua nahin dekha tha
 Everywhere there was the same focal point, in the middle of the lamp was burning
 
 
 ujali-ujali
 
 
 Everyone else got foggy
 yahan maamla ulataa tha
 
 
 The focus was that he became a bully
 
 
 dekhne main kareeb-kareeb kurup
 
 
 rude
 rachana kaa cheharaa ab utana kaala nahin rah gaya tha, par dhoop main jhulase hue chehre kaa rang ab bhi tair rahaa tha vahaan
 "I was telling him the tense situation of the officers of this department," Keshavdas said in a stoic manner towards the composition, "now Shukla is like this in this department - clever, though not very clever
" 
 
 "vah hansaa, amaru or rachana ne bhi uskaa saath diya
 Hearing my name, like i was awakened, i was suddenly connected to other things in the room, as the coaches are added, jerking, hitting something
 main itnaa alag-thalag tha ab tak
 
 
 Did not listen to his words like Amaru
 
 
 shaayad isi se kudhakar mathuradas ne yah baat kahi thi
 
 
 What could be the reason for this, it had become a question of some other time
 
 
 main tanaav se bhar aayaa, kuch kehane bhi ja rahaa tha par shaayad vah taiyaar tha or aage kuch zyada hi jor se bolta gaya, mujhe 'shasip’-sa kehete hue
 After closing my mouth, he had come back to his affair
 uske hisaab se mere liye philhal utana kaaphi tha
 His target was sitting in the right place
 mujhe rachana se koi khaas ummid nahin thi, par amaru kaa rukh mujhe saaf-saaf kharaab laga
 After all, that was what brought me here
 
 
 or vah lapakkar keshavadas kii taraf ho gaya
 That is why officers are called as 'bharua Kaum'
 main akelaa mahasoos kar rahaa tha, par tabhi baahar chale janaa bhi apmaan dhonaa hi tha
 The situation was not really as common as i had tried to be a while ago
 
 
 kahin se vah asaamaanya keshavadas ke liye bhi thi kyonki maine use itnaa uttejit kabhi nahin dekha tha
 He was being very smart, brainy, smart and vigorously trying to appear everything
 main nahin samajhataa ki vah apane offis main mujhe yaa kisi ko is tarah jaleel karata
 Everything looked affected by the presence of a woman
 pehle uski pratiksha kii maujuudagi or ab saakshaat uski
 
 
 Either Keshavdas felt disturbed in his solitude and wanted to stop any other such efforts for the days ahead
 
 
 yaa vah mujhe apana pratidwandvi mahasoos kar baitha tha
 Amaru and i used to roll this role more easily and easily on me
 
 
 kyonki amaru ek sidhaa-sada ladkaa tha or dikhataa bhi tha
 If we had any confusion with Keshavdas' presence there, then Keshavdas could have been even more when i came
 keshavadas jor-jor se baat kiye ja rahaa tha
 i felt as if he was throwing stones at each other in an attempt to bridge his age gap
 saadhaarant: vah itnaa batooni nahin tha kyonki bahut bolne main use takalif hoti thi
 His stomach used to move while talking
 mujhe uski harakat kishoron-jaisi lagi

 With Stuart Broad and James Anderson returning on time, England retained their hopes of reaching the World Cup quarter-finals with a six-run win over South Africa in a low-scoring match on Sunday
 jonathan traat(52) or ravi bopaara(60) ke ardhashtakon ke baavjood england kii team dakshin africa spinneron ke jaal main funskar 45
 Stacked for 171 runs in 4 overs, it seemed that if he would be trapped in the vortex of Magar
 lekin em e chidambaram stadium kii pich gendbaajon ke liye hi swarg sabit hui
 South Africa got off to a decent start with Hashim Amla's (42) innings and at one time progressing towards a one-sided victory
 broad ne aise samay main 15 ran dekar chaar tathaa anderson ne 16 ran ke evaj main do wicket lekar dakshin africa kaa 165 ran par pulinda baandh diya
 For England, who suffered an unexpected defeat to Ireland, winning the match was crucial to being in the race for the quarter-finals
 uske ab chaar match main paanch ank ho gayi hai or vah group bi main sheersh par pahunch gaya he
 South Africa's victory campaign, on the other hand, came to a standstill with four points remaining in their three matches
 baharhaal bhartiya sarajameen par pehali baar kisi match main puri tarah se gendbaajon kaa dabadabaa dekhne ko mila
 For South Africa, Robin Pietersen (3 for 22) and Imran Tahir (4 for 38) spread the magic of spin bowling, while the England fast bowlers defended the small score well
 aaf spinner greem swaan ne england ko pehali safalataa dilaayi
 His flight took a light edge of Smith's bat and went to the gloves of wicketkeeper Matt Prior for which the on-field umpires had to take the help of the third umpire
 iske baad broad ne amala ko bold kiya or phir agle over main kallis ko wicket ke peeche kaich karaayaa
 AB de Villiers, who scored a century in the last two matches, was still at the crease and together with Faf du Plessis (17) took the score to 124 runs but South Africa lost three wickets on the same score
 andrew straas ne anderson ko duusare spel ke liye bulaayaa or unhone divilliars kii gilliyaan bikher di jinhone 44 gend par 25 ran banaaye lekin ek baar bhi gend seemaa rekha paar nahin bhej paye
 In the next over, du Plessis was run out, while JP Duminy missed the ball taking Anderson's swing and bowled and returned to the pavilion
 robin petersan ke out hone se jab team buree tarah sankat main funs gayi thi tab del sten(20) or morne vaan vik(13) ne aathven wicket ke liye 33 ran kii saajhedaari karke ummid jagaayi
 When South Africa were in need of eight off 18 balls, Brad fired a long-haul to dismiss England's Stan and Morne Morkel for joy
 iske do gend baad petersan ne visphotak ballebaaj kevin petersan(2) ko bhi pavilion kii raah dikhaa di jinhone pehali slip main jaak kallis ko kaich thamaya
 Pietersen dismissed Ian Bell (5) and made England score 15 for three
 bel flite ko samajhane main naakaam rahe or petersan ne apane baayin taraf dive lagaakar behtareen kaich liya
 Trott and Bopara tried to finish the innings and added 99 runs for the fourth wicket but both of them scored at a very slow pace, which did not make the South African camp seem worried in any way
 traat ne apane 52 ran ke liye jahaan 94 gend kheli vahiin bopaara ne 60 ran ke liye 98 gend kharch kii
 Both batsmen hit three fours
 bopaara is bich pari kaa ekmaatr chakka lagane main bhi safal rahe
 Trott broke the partnership by catching leg-spinner Tahir on his own ball
 iske baad dakshin africa tej gendbaajon ne bhi apana jalawaa dikhaaya
 Morkel lbw to Bopara after Matt Prior (10) was dismissed
 ballebaaj ne iske liye refral maanga lekin riple se saaf ho gaya ki gend leg or middle stump ke bich main lag rahi thi
 Stan and Tahir did not take long to consolidate England's lower order thereafter
 sten ne 37 ran dekar ek jabaki morkal ne 16 ran dekar do wicket liye

 Racism has come to light in cricket
 ye nayaa kissa he ipel kii sabase mashhoor magar pity hui team nite rides kaa
 Indian players are being treated badly in this team of King Khan
 kisi ko bevajaah maidan se baahar bula liya jaataa he, kisi ko kaha jaataa he ki jo kahuunga tumhen maananaa padegaa
 This kind of rude behavior only happens to Indian players in Knight Riders, while foreign players stay in full pleasure
 ye aarope lagaaya he purv cricketer ajay jadeja ne
 Ajay Jadeja said that no blogger is needed to understand this
 ye pakkaa he ki nite rides main bhartiya khilaadiyon ke saath unheen kii gharelu cricket lig main videshi staff budtamiji karte hai
 i am an Indian player, i know many players in that team
 ek khilaadi ko maidan se baahar bula liya gaya, usne poocha kyon, to use jawaab mila, you indian, vahi karo jo kahata hum
 How Indian players will feel comfortable there
 vahaan bhartiya or videshi khilaadi bante hue hai
 Their thinking is divided
 meraa matlab he jaise saurav ganguli alag tareeke se sochate hai isliye isamen koi shaq nahin ki team puri tarah tuuti hui he
 Ajay Jadeja claims that these are not just allegations, but directly spoken out of the words of the players who have suffered the comments of this racism
 jadeja ke mutabik ye baaten unhen team ke andar ke aadmi se hi pataa chali hai
 By the way, the matter of Jadeja has now come to the fore, Knight Riders have been in controversy since the beginning of this season
 pehle saurav ganguli ko captaini se hataanaa, videshi khilaadiyon ko zyada se zyada taadaad main laana, videshi captain or coach jon bukanan kii baton ko upar rakhana
 Advocating multiple captain theory in the team, Knight Riders has been involved in similar controversies since the beginning

 Vijay Mallya, who has always been in the news for his liquor and airlines business in the country, is accused of rigging a loan of Rs 9000 crore in the name of Kingfisher Airlines from about a dozen banks

 While launching his car for Formula 1 racing in London, Mallya said that India's state-run banks are incurring responsibility on themselves if the country's largest airlines fail
 maalya ne kaha ki lone kii recovery puri tarah se civil court kaa maamla he
 But under the pressure of the Central Government, the CBI has converted the entire case into a criminal case so that they can be arrested
 iske baad unparfrod or mani-nonderingka maamla darj kiya gaya he
 Mallya claimed to Dawa Writer that he would fight a legal battle as the Indian government did not have sufficient grounds to take any action against him

 jin khilaadiyon ke chayan kii ummid thi, unamem kolkata niterides ke captain gautam gambhir (gautam Gambhir) bhi shaamil hai, lekin aisa nahin hua
 Gambhir's fans reacted to this, but Gambhir had considered himself out of the race even before the team was selected
 ipel main shandaar khel dikhaa rahe keker ke captain gautam gambhir ko champions trophy ke liye saurav ganguli jaise diggajon kaa bhi saath mila, lekin chayankartaaon ne unhen iske laayak nahin samajha
 By the way, it seems from Gautam Gambhir's words that he was also thinking of himself as inferior
 khulkar raay rakhane ke liye mashhoor gautam gambhir ne is bare main poochne par kaha, 'tii-20 main acha pradarshan karne se aap keval tii-20 team main hi chayan ke liye uplabdh hote hai

 vaise gautam gambhir kii baton se bhi aisa lag rahaa he ki vah bhi khud ko kamatar samaj rahe the
 Gautam Gambhir, known for his open opinion, said about this, "by doing well in T20, you are only available for selection in T20 team

 In its cut, Congress has promised a minimum income guarantee scheme for all citizens
 gaai 1980 se aay ko badhaava dene ke siddhant kaa pratipaadan kar rahe hai
 Highlights: They have identified three categories of people as perennially employed people - those millions who work as laborers with no occupational identity; Old working class with limited education and those young and educated people who are disappointed because their expectations of life are not fulfilled

 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav se pehle bahujan samaaj party kii supremeo mayawati khulkar tripal talaak ke mudde par muslim sanghathanon ke samarthan main saamne aa gai hai
 On Monday, the Prime Minister almost made it clear in Mahoba that the triple talaq would end and Muslim women would get rid of this practice, then on Tuesday, Mayawati played her Muslim card
 mayawati ne press relies jari kar kaha ki tripal talaak kaa mudda musalamaanon or unke sanghathano par chhod dena chahie
 Mayawati also said that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) should stop imposing its agenda on the pretext of triple divorce
 mayawati ne kaha ki is mudde ko musalamaanon ke bheetar hi aam raay banane tak unke samaaj ke upar hi chhod dena chahie or kisi ko unke upar thopanaa nahin chahie
 Significantly, PM Modi made it clear for the first time in Mahoba of Bundelkhand that this practice is now on the verge of extinction
 tripal talaaq par mayawati ke khulkar bolne ke siyaasi myne hai, upi main chunaav sar par he auramayawatiki jeet musalamaanon ke ekamusth vot par nirbhar karti he
 Seeing the way in which the Samajwadi Party has created a fierce situation, the Muslims of the state can stand behind Mayawati and Mayawati does not want to let this opportunity go away

 The same is true of Delhi, with different cultures embedded within it, every corner of which bears testimony to a history, with greenery littered on every side of the track, which changes clothes and colors with every changing season, but women If the concern of security here is taking the form of an epidemic, then there is another thing that everyone is feeling - there is something in the air here that is harmful, poisonous, in a tremendous way It is dirty and disgusting
 180 dablyuechao sanghathan se lekar uniwarsity of saare or barkali kii uniwarsity of california se lekar dilli, kanpur or mumbai ke iity tak duniya bhar ke sansthaanon ke jaankaron ne pichley do varshon ke dauraan kiye apane surveykshanon kaa ek hi nishkarsh diya he ki yah shahar ab duniya kaa sabase pradooshit shahar ban chukaa he
 India's 25 cities are among the world's most polluted and Delhi tops the notorious list
 maape ja sakane vaale kanon ke bich sabase chote or sabase khatarnaak padaarth piem 2
 a resident of Delhi is consuming an average of 153 micrograms of particles inhalation at the rate of 5 per cubic meter, which is 15 times the WHO set annual average standard
 yah tathy khatre kii ghanti bajaane ke liye ajeeb jaan pad saktaa he, lekin bimariyon or maut kaa saaya abhi se hi sir par mandaraane laga he
 This particle first affects the weak
 dhundh kii gandh, ankhon kaa jalanaa, kuhase bhari subah or dhundhlee raaten ek gahare rog ke sirf lakshan hai
 Regarding airborne particles and sulfur dioxide, doctors say that this increases mortality, increases morbidity and affects lung function
 ve kehete hai ki ye maheen kan hamaari shwaas pranali main ghus jate hai or hamaari rog pratirohak kshamta main badlaav laa sakate hai, liver or kidney or bacchon ke mastishk ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai jisase unka ikyuu kam ho saktaa he, unki ekaagratha kam ho sakati he or sakriyata bad jaati he
 An increase in carbon monoxide levels can affect the heart arteries, especially in children and may attack the nervous system
 kendriya pradooshan niyantran board (sipisibi) ke 2012 main jari do adhyayan bataate hai ki dilli main rahane vaale paanch main se ek vayask or chaar main se ek bachche ko upree shwasan tantra kaa rog tha or yah sankhya badhata hua rujhaan dikhaati he
 There is no longer any opinion that much faster action is needed
 in sardiyon main jab hawa kii gunvattta apane sabase nichle str par he, achaanak kuch apaat upaay dekhne main aa rahe hai or pradooshan sudhaaron ke maamle main dilli kuch aise prayogon kaa udhaaharan banane ja rahi he jiske dirghakaalik parinaam gwalior, patna or ahmedabad jaise kuch duusare shaharon ke liye kaaphi kargar honge jo aisi hi samasya se kamobesh jujh rahe hai (dekhen box)
 The Aam Aadmi Party government led by Arvind Kejriwal has suggested some half-hearted but incomplete measures to start this war
 nyaaypalika ne isamen apni ore se kuch vajan jod diya he
 The government of Delhi wants private four wheelers to leave the streets on the basis of even and odd numbers written on their number plates
 duusari ore adaalat ne ek kadam aage badhkar sabhi dijal chaalit vaahanon ko sadak se charanbaddh rup se hataane ko kah diya he
 The executive and the judiciary have finally decided to fight this problem, shouting out the two schemes and ignoring the systemic problems
 mudda thik he to bahasabaaji main koi dikkat nahin honi chahie, lekin buniyadi sawaal yah he ki yah samasya aakhir kitni vikaraal he, yah itani vikaraal kaise ho gai, kya isse ladgaye ke liye kiye ja rahe upaay paryaapt honge yaa phir samasya kii jad kahin or he jabaki use galat khunte se baandhne kaa kii koshish ho rahi he?dilli kii pradooshan samasya ko samajhane kaa pehla kadam shaayad yah hona chahie ki ham is shahar ko samaj len&is shahar kaa matlab isaki mahatvakankshaon ko or isaki sanrachana ko
 Delhi is basically a network of a few occupations or, say, a network of villages that are interconnected by roads that intersect, divide, or intermingle
 yah shahar ek ke baad ek golakaron kaa ek aisa silsilaa he jahaan pravesh or nikasi ke tamaam bindu maujuud hai lekin na to koi ek kendriya vyavsaayik sthal he or na hi yahaan kaa koi spasht awasaiya pattern he
 The city is as tall as it is wide, unlike Mumbai, which is gradually developed into a triangle with arms of different sizes, gradually developing from a long line along the sea
 dilli kii aabaadi khatarnaak tareeke se bad rahi he or pichley do dashakon main yah ek karod se do karod tak pahunch chuki he
 Apart from this, the new cities around it like Gurgaon and Noida, which are given the name of the National Capital Region, are as commercial as residential
 kah sakate hai ki dilli chaaron ore jameen se ghiri hui dhuen kii ek handi he jiskaa bahari ilaaka kahin zyada dhuen se lipta he
 There is no natural process of clearing the air like the coastal cities
 iske alaava ek dikkat yah he ki is shahar kii vruddhi kaa pattern itnaa sangathit he ki sabake liye kargar ek jan parivahan pranali bananaa bahut kathin he kyonki yahi baat saaf nahin he ki log kahaan rahete hai or kahaan kaam karte hai
 As Anumita Raychaudhuri, executive director of research and advocacy at the Center for Science and Environment (CSE) says, Delhi is “plagued by design disturbances
 ” shahari yojanakaar or harvard graduate skool of dizin main shahari dizin or niyojan ke professor rahul mehrotra ke mutabik yah shahar “kharaab bhoomi-upyog niyojan kaa shikaar he
 “it is due to this haphazard structure that Delhi's biggest middle class dream is to have a private vehicle, so the emphasis of the transportation system here is focused on promoting private vehicles
 dilli main aap kaamyaab hai, iskaa saboot bas yahi he ki aapke paas apana ek nijee vaahan ho
 As a result of this, there are a total of 88 lakh vehicles in the city and 1,400 consignments are added to it every month
 yah sankhya mumbai, kolkata or chennai kii sammilit sankhya se zyada he, haalanki isamen se 65 fisadi dopahiyaa vaahan hai
 Another problem is that like other big cities of India, the expansion of Delhi has been so rapid that the infrastructure here has not been able to match it
 mehrotra kehete hai, “bharat kii vishisht sthiti yah he ki yahaan saarvajanik parivahan se judi karravaaiyaan sabase pichhali qatari main rahati hai
 “this is in stark contrast to other major cities in the world, where public transport and cheap housing opportunities have made new and improved interconnected housing possible
 dilli kii saarvajanik parivahan pranali ne shaharikaran kii aguai karne kii bajaae hameshaa uskaa pichhalggu bananaa hi sweekaar kiya
 And this makes the problem condensate
 inhen kaarnon se dilli main saarvajanik parivahan kaa istemaal gaiyr-aaraamdeh he or nijee vaahanon ke mukaable ve kam sakasham bhi hai
 This double problem only makes a significant difference, because most of the people of Delhi who rely on public transport, neither get the benefit of time nor reduce their stress
 masalan, mumbai main aap andheri se charchget train se jate hai to isamen 45 minute kaa vakt lagata he lekin car se isamen do ghante lag sakate hai
 So even if the car is a great option, it wastes your time
 iske thik ulat dilli ko len jahaan dakshini dilli se noida jane main car se agar 50 minute lagate hai to train se do ghante lag sakate hai jisamen stesan tak pahunchnaa or vahaan se gantavy tak jane kaa samay bhi shaamil he
 That is, public transport in Delhi is not only annoying but also eats time
 yahi buniyadi vajah he ki dilli main agar koi nijee vaahan kharidne kii kshamta rakhata he to vah aisa kar letaa he bajaae mumbai ke yaa duniya ke duusare behatar jude hue shaharon ke, jahaan nijee vaahan kaa uddeshy paariwarik yatraaon yaa saptahik manoranjan tak simit he
 This is the reason that even the odd-even measure being implemented by the Aam Aadmi Party government from January 1 to January 15 will probably fail
 nijee suvidha ko pradooshan jaisi samasya ke liye tilanjali de dena acchhee baat he, lekin logon par yah bharosa karnaa ki ve “vyapak hit” ke naam par ek aksham pranali ko gale lagaayenge, sadichha se zyada kuch nahin he
 There is also a lack of capacity - according to Sarat Guttikunda of Urban Emissions, 13,000 additional buses will be needed to handle the extra load on the road, while the government has so far managed only 6,000 buses
 lihaaja is yojana main paryaapt sambhaavna he ki shahar main yah ek nai gadabadi ko paidaa karegi
 The consequences of widespread concern can be disastrously fatal because the withdrawal of the rule in the face of its improper implementation will only harm it rather than help the war against pollution
 yah shila dikshit kii sarkaar main lagu kii gai mahatvakankshi bas rapid transit len kii yojana se koi alag nahin hoga, jiskaa ant zyada behatar bas seva kii maang main hua tha
 Perhaps the Kejriwal government will have to think on this
 kuch nishchit avadhi ke liye nunatam riyaayaton ke saath ek apaat upaay ke taur par ise lagu kiya jaae tab to thik he, varanaa sam-visham vaala formula isliye apraasangik he kyonki pradooshan kii samasya ke saath yah bemail he
 Guttikunda explains that vehicular pollution depends on three basic things - the number of vehicles on the road, the distance traveled by each vehicle, and the emissions from each
 sam-visham formule ke chalate agar dilli kii sadakon se 88 lakh vaahanon main se 44 lakh gaayab ho gaye, to anumaan he ki isse utsarjan main 50 fisadi kii kami aegi
 This matter, however, transcends simple mathematics
 dilli sarkaar ne jin riyaayaton kaa prastaav rakhaa he agar unhen sangyaan main liya jaae-jaise dopahiyaa vaahanon ko riyaayat, kyonki is par chalane vaale log aam aadmi party ke samarthakon kaa bada hissaa hai, suraksha kaarnon se mahilaon ko riyaayat or marijon samet ambulance or police kii gaadi ko riyaayat-to andaajan 25 lakh or vaahan sadak par rah jaaenge jiske chalate kul sankhya main mahaj 20 lakh kii katautee ho paaegi
 Also, it is worth noting that wherever equidistant measures have been implemented — such as in Mexico City and Bogotá — the distance traveled for each vehicle has increased because then all members of the same vehicle family Serves many trips
 yani ek vaahan kaa chakkar 25 fisadi bhi bad gaya, to yah 15 lakh vaahanon ke baraabar ke utsarjan ko sadakon par waapas laa degaa
 This means that only five lakh vehicles will be able to stay off the roads
 isse kuch alpakaalik laabh avashya honge
 For example, the number of vehicles that emit smoke in your neighborhood will be reduced and emissions of nitrate will also decrease, but this will prove to be nothing more than a huge fuss for small gains

 The odd-even formula can of course be successful to some extent, if it is implemented for a short period without any concessions so that people cannot buy new cars or change their registration numbers in homes with more than one vehicle
 
 pradooshan se ladgaye ke liye ranneetiyaan ijad karne or sam-visham vaale formule ko thos rup dene ke liye dilli sarkaar ke saath kai baithken kar chukin siesai kii raichoudhary kahati hai, “apaat seva vaale vaahanon ke alaava ham kisi or riyaayat ke paksh main nahin hai
 "anyway, vehicular emissions account for only 20 per cent of Delhi's pollution while construction activities contribute 45 per cent to the cause
 iske alaava bijli kii kami ko puraa karne ke liye gharon or dacrataron main chalane vaale janarator set, audyogic kachra or kachare ko khule main jalaae jane se bhi pradooshan main yogadan hota he (dekhen graphic) or pareshaani badhati he
 Despite this, the Aam Aadmi Party's efforts are being described by many knowledgeable historians like Raychaudhuri and there are reasons behind it
 aisa pehali baar hua he ki ek aise desh main nijee vaahanon par thodi pabandi lagaai ja rahi he jahaan car maalik bas ek baar akhil bhartiya sadak kar chukaate hon, gharon main nickshulk parking karte hon, bazaaron main sasti parking kaa laabh uthaate hon or jam main unase koi shulk nahin vasula jaataa he
 In this sense, this step is an indication that the time has come to rein in private vehicles, they do not have to pay any special money

 Implementing these measures, however, will not be easy as it will have to rely on the Delhi Police, which does not come under the control of the Delhi government, but towards which its hostile attitude is absolutely public
 yahaan tak ki ghatiya yaa mishrit eendhan istemaal karne vaale trakon ko shahar main ghusane se rokna bhi dushkar hoga, baavjood iske supreme court ke lagaae shharith kary se dilli se unhen guzarane ko hatotsahit karata he
 a recent study by CSE shows that 1,15,000 light commercial and heavy trucks enter Delhi every day

 "after this, he talks about a traffic system that can keep people's accommodation and people's workplace in mind
 ve kehete hai, “bhoomi-upyog niyojan or yatayaat ko ek saath viksit hona chahie
 In fact, this should be the only scale
 ” or ant main, saarvajanik parivahan kaa istemaal shahar ke vikaas ke liye hona chahie or iske liye nav-viksit jan parivahan kendron ke irdagird saste awaasan kii suvidha honi chahie
 It is important for Delhi that when awareness about pollution has increased so much, it should give direction to the overall change
 yah dhyaan rakhana hoga ki yah aag bujhane jaisaa koi taatkaalik kaam nahin he ki ekaadh chote-mote samaadhaanon se laabh mil jayega
 The phase of little optimism is over now
