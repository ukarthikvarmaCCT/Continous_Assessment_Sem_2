 marathavada main rashtriya ausat se kaaphi kam 882 mimi barish hui or vidarbha main 1034 mimi yani rashtriya ausat se adhik
 But the average rainfall in Rajasthan is not more than 400 mm, so why not there is a situation like Marathwada there

 posta post shared byek❤️ (@ektaravikapoor) onjan 19, 2019 at 5:31 am PST Talking about Kapil Sharma's work front, he has returned to the small screen after a long gap
 apane puraane sho da kapil sharma sho ke nae sanskaran ke saath ve darshakon ko ek baar phir se hansaa rahe hai
 The show has been a good success so far and is being liked
 bataa den ki sho kaa prodection salmaan khan ne kiya he
 Salman Khan along with his fathersaleem Khan and brothers has also knocked on the show
 bispi ke dalit vot bank main send lagane kii bijepi kii koshish kitni safal hogi, ye kahana to philhal mushkil he
 However, the bjp's attempt to dent Buddhism among the Dalits who have adopted Buddhism has certainly drawn concerns in front of the BSP
 jis tarah se bispi brahmanon ke bich sammelan karne main juty he, kuch usee tarah se bijepi bhi bispi ke nav baudhon ke bich apni pahunch banane main jute gai he, aise main donon partiyaan daliton ko lekar aamane-saamne aa gai hai
 The presence of Buddhist monks on the bjp's platform during the Dhamma Chetna Yatra in Kanpur called the Tilmilai BSP a fake Dhamma Chetna Yatra
 bispi kaa kahana he ki manch par maujuud buddha bhikshu asli buddha nahin the
 Also, no Dalit was also present in this Dhamma Chetna Yatra
 mayawati ne kaha tha- yatra main shaamil the sangh ke logis yatra ko lekar bispi supremeo mayawati ne kaha ki bijepi dharm ko raajnneetik or chunavi swaarth ke liye istemaal kar rahi he
 In the wake of the state assembly elections, the Dhamma Chetna Yatra organized by this party has been conducted through some sponsored Buddhist monks
 isamen sangh ke log shaamil the
 BJP State President said - After the statement of Mayawatimayavati, apologize, BJP State President Keshav Maurya has said that Mayawati has insulted the Buddhist monks
 unhen iske liye maafee maangani chahie
 It is clear that BSP and BJP are now face to face on dalit-buddhist politics
 kya he takaraar kii vajah?isaki ek vajah bhi he ki nav dalit buddha khud kombedkarvaadeebhi maanate hai, jo baba sahab ke sapanom kaa bharat chaahate hai
 The BJP has never taken to Buddha among the Dalits and these people have been feeling more connected with parties like either BSP or RPI
 lekin, pehali baar bijepi ne yahaan bhi entry kar di he
 The Dhamma Yatra has been the hallmark of the BSP, but the BJP has now started doing it in its court
 yahi vajah he ki dhamm chetana yatra par kisi party ne koi pratikriya nahin di sivaae bispi ke
 Amit Shah addressed the Dhamma Yatra for 174 days and traveled about 27 thousand km to the Dalit villages and towns of UP and reached Yedhamma Chetna Yatrakanpur, where Amit Shah addressed hundreds of monks
 haalanki, is dhamm chetana yatra ko kai jagahon par virodh kaa saamana bhi karnaa padaa
 The entry of Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, who was accused in the Malegaon bomb blast, is in the news
 bhopal sansadeey seat se bhartiya janata party(bijepi) kii ore se pragna thakur congress ke diggaj netaa digvijay singh ke khilaaf chunaav lard rahi hai
 Pragya Thakur is out on bail in the bomb blast case
 unki raajnneetik entry sawaalon ke ghere main hai
 Opposition parties of the BJP have launched a scathing attack on the ticket given to a woman accused in a terrorist incident
 is maamle main jab ajtak ne pragna thakur se sawaal kiya to unhone congress party or digvijay singh ko sawaalon ke ghere main le liya
 Pragya Thakur accused the Congress of harassment
 unhone kaha ki court main enai ne kaha he ki court main unke khilaaf koi saboot nahin he
 Therefore they are innocent
 saath hi pragna thakur ne kaha ki hiraasat or jail main rakhane ke dauraan unhen pratadit kiya gaya
 Aajtak asked him that there has been an atry in your recent politics while in front of Congress veteran Digvijay Singh
 kaise saamne tikengi
 On this question till date, Pragya Thakur said, 'when i was very young i had decided that i will live for the country and will die for the country
 uske baad desh ke liye saunp diya tha
 The person who surrenders for the country is not that it is not persuaded
 haa nishchit rup se mujhe dalgat raajnneeti kaa anubhav nahin he
 But i have conducted elections
 chunaav campaning kii he
 It is not just me who is contesting elections
 bijepi chunaav lard rahi he
 People work for the country in BJP
 jinka raajnneetik anubhav bhi he
 The public has also seen the rule of the Congress and the BJP
 isliye pataa he ki koun manjhi hui raajnneeti karti he or koun chal karata he
 When asked if the BJP has given you a ticket to stay in the disputes, Sadhvi Pragya said, 'I have never been in controversies
 meraa jo jivan he bahut pehle se aap dekh rahe hai ki mere upar koi ansh maatr kaa bhi aarope nahin tha
 The controversy that has created this is called saffron terrorism, Hindutva is called terrorism
 yah shadyantr inkaa(congress) he or inhone hi vivaad khadaa kiya he
 So they are getting scared
 aatankwaad ke aaropon par sadhvi pragna ne kaha, ' aarope bhi inke kehane par lagaaya he
 And they have done this as a conspiracy
 ki jisase koi bhi deshbhakt ho vah khadaa na ho sake
 And this is their trick
 main jamaanat par hum
 i have been given a clean chit by the NIA
 kyonki mere viruddh kabhi kuch nahin tha or na hi he
 On the allegation that the NIA is working under the pressure of the government in the case of Sadhvi Pragya, Sadhvi said, "it is the NIA who set up the NIA specifically for such cases
" mumbai hamale ke baad 26 / 11 ke hamale ke baad congress ne enie kaa gathan kiya tha
 He had specially given his people a place in this team
 aaj ve unheen par prashn chinh khadaa karne lage hai
 Now what can i say to his opinion
 'umr abdulla ke us bayaan par jisamen unhone kaha ki aapaki tabiyat thik ho gai he to aap waapas jail jane laayak ho gayi hai sadhvi pragna ne kaha, 'unki jaankaree galat he
 i guess why didn't they say that i should be hanged immediately
 inkaa shadyantr to yahi tha
 i have not received Bell on health grounds
 'hindu raashtra maamle par sadhvi pragna ne kaha ki yah aparaadh nahin he
 The Congress calls terrorists those who serve in the name of the country
 congress bharat ko aatankwaadi desh bananaa chaahati he
 In response to a question, Sadhvi Pragya said that i am a true proof of the misdeeds of the Congress
 digvijay singh par hindu aatankwaad ke siddhant ko badhaava dene ke aarope hai
 In response to the question on this, Sadhvi Pragya said, 'they can illegally enter any person
 or uske upar koi bhi aarope laga sakate hai
 His habit of accusing is old
 'sadhvi pragna ne kaha, 'enie ne siddh kiya he ki main aatankwaadi nahin hum
 Top Congress leaders are out on bail
 main shuddh hum
 i am not involved in any case
 sadhvi pragna ne kaha congressi samaaj ko samvedanheen karnaa chaahate hai
 They tried to kill me
 meri raksha bhagwaan ne kii he
 Congress conspires and implicates people

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator The growing 3488 km long Himalayan mountain region, receding from 9000 to 18700 feet in altitude, minus 40 degrees below zero, with scorching winter locations, bottomless valleys, inaccessible pits, dangerous rivers, unheard glaciers, rocky slopes and invisible natural hazards
 Meanwhile, ITBP jawans and officers spend a large part of their service time
 inkaa kaam un khatarnaak karakoram darre se lekar arunachal pradesh main diphu laa tak vistrut he
 The itbpfka Bahadur Commando remains loyal to its duty and adamant in any kind of difficult situation, human or natural, with a slogan of 'bravery and devout commitment'
 18 hajaar foot se bhi zyada oonchai par he barf kii ek bejaan duniya
 Where the sky along with the land is also an enemy of life, but in this barren world of snow the sound of human footsteps resonates
 ye koi aam insaan nahin, balki wo jaanbaaj ITBP ke himavir hai jo bharat-china ke bich sarhad kii nigahabaani main date hai
 While in the lap of the Himalayas, these soldiers protect the border in this snowy area
 jitna khatra dushmano se nahin hota he usase kahin zyada khatra is puure kshetra main faili barf kii chadar se hota he
 According to one information, the weather of the soldiers is so high in high altitude that it is very difficult for them to overcome it
 ye jawan jab barfile ilaake main chalate hai tab inako is taapmaana main jane se pehle ITBP ke trainer kai dinon tak step bai step alag alag taapmaana vaale altitude main rakhaa jaataa he
 After that, when these soldiers get accustomed to staying in the snowy area, then these soldiers are posted in the BOP of the indo-china border at the height of 18,700 feet
 is barfile aria main javaanon ke liye kai kathinaaiyaan bhale hi aati ho par desh kii aan-baan or shaan ke liye hameshaa ye ITBP ke jawan jaan jokhim main daalate hai
 In the snowy area, they monitor the border by wearing jawanbal kalwa - it is made of silk and wool, it protects the jawans from the cold in this snowstorm
 1 snow gogal- javaanon ko ultra vilet kiran se bachaati he
 When snow falls on the snow, the soldiers are at risk of color blindness, this snow goggle also protects from that danger
 2 chehre par san screen- kyonki hai altitude main UV kiran zyada padati he or javaanon ko kaala kar detii he isliye san screen lagaaya jaataa he
 3 AVD (avalanch Victim Device) - When the soldiers go from the avalanche prone area, then these instruments are used to find them if they get hit by avalanche under a snow mountain
 4 bag pack- isamen ready maid food pack, javaanon kaa rashan, stove, avalanch cord, dry fruits, chocolate, dalia aadi rahata he
 5 Modern shoes- The shoes of the jawans are made in a special way
 When the youngsters wear this shoe, then these shoes become very hot inside due to body wear
 javaanon ke liye aise hota he 'oparation avalanch'jawan jab sarhad kii hifaazat kar rahe hote hai to un par ek adrishy khatra avalanch kaa rahata he
 After the arrival of this avalanche, the soldiers are buried under a mountain of snow
 akhir kaise hota he puraa rescue oparation or kaise aata he avalanch
 Let me tell you that although the army soldier Hanumanthappa who escaped alive in Siachen even under thirty feet of snow for six days could not be saved, but it is definitely learned from this
 3 farvari 2016 ko jab siachin kii sonam post, 19 hajaar 600 feet kii unchai par hanumanthpa or baaki 9 jawan tainaat the tab kudarat kaa sabase khaufnak hamalaa himaskhalan ke taur par hua
 The rock of ice fell on their post in a moment and then everything became calm
 1 kilometre chaudee or 800 meter oonchi barf kii ek diwaar unke camp par aa giri thi
 And all the soldiers were buried
 yahaan ye sab is liye bataa rahe hai ki army kii tarah ITBP bhi hai altitude main tainaat rahati he
 Where there is an avalanche or avalanche, then the young men survive
 radio signlaradio signal tab kaam aata he jab post puri tarah se barf me dab chuki hoti he
 But this signal device can catch the signal of any mobile or satellite phone up to 20 feet below
 radar EQUIPMENT 20 feet neeche kisi bhi thermal-signechar, hit yaa metel ko detect kar saktaa he
 The rescue team first went there and prepared the post for medical help
 iske baad team ne post ke aasapaas ke ilaake main spot pataa lagaae jahaan par radio signal or special radar ko halchal mil rahi thi
 All the spots were dug closely, one by one
 rock-drill se ICE-BOULDERS yani barf kii chattan jo diwaar yaa chat se bhi zyada majboot hoti he use kaata jaataa he
 Arctic tents were shown to the rescuers at several feet, in fact, posts are prepared in 18000 feet only in these special types of tents
 'iglu' main mines 40 degree jaan bachaane ke liye jawan kai-kai maheenon tak rahete hai
 a house made of ice, ie igloo, is used by people living in Antarctica
 par ITBP ke jawan jab bhi hai altitude main sarhad kii raksha karte hai tab aise barf ke bane asthai shelter main rahete hai
 These shelters make ITBP personnel in 4 to 5 hours
 iglu main aise banataa he javaanon kaa khanajab jawan kisi barfile ilaake main sarhad kii raksha karte karte vahiin sarhad par rukate hai jahaan sthai shelter nahin hote vahaan par asthai shelter bana kar andar kaa taapmaana mentin karte hai
 Then inside it, 6 to 7 soldiers can stay with their weapons for several days
 is barf ke bane ghar main aam logon kaa rahanaa bada hi mushkil ho saktaa he par desh kii sarhadon kii raksha karne vaale ye jawan iske andar rahete hai
 Apart from food, there is readymade food and dry fruit
 barfistaan ke andar barf ke bane is ghar main javaanon ke paas baadaam, kaashew, kishmish, chocolate, butter, mix zeus, dalia, biscuit, jaise saamaan is iglu ke andar rahete hai
 We do rest in 'snow Cave', when we have to rest, we find warm beds, but our brave soldiers cover the snow to protect the country, they lay it and have their own house
 duty ke dauraan javaanon ko shunya se kam taapmaana main rahanaa hota he
 They protect the country by making ice caves there
 is barf kii gupha ke andar 2 log rah sakate hai
 The youngsters maintain the temperature inside the body heat
 purushon se kam nahin hai mahila commandobharat-china seemaa par sthit 15 chaukiyon par kuch maheene itibipi kii mahila commando tainaat kii gai hai
 Whose enemies will keep a close watch on 24 hours
 ye mahila commandon har kisi musiibat kaa saamana karne main sakasham hai
 These women commanders are protecting the country's frontiers in minus temperatures at high altitude
 ye mahila commando purushon ke saath kandhe se kandhaa milakar hai altitude main apni jaan kii baaji lagaakar desh kii sarhadon kii raksha kar rahi hai
 While protecting the border, the soldiers have this disease in Siachen and other areas of the country, due to which there is too much snow, due to which the soldiers stationed in Siachen are killed less by enemy firing but more due to bad weather
 avalanch or kharaab mausam ke kaaran pichley 12 saal main siachin main 900 sena ke javaanon kii mautein ho chuki hai
 However, not only Siachen, even in the areas where ITBP is deployed, the temperature drops to minus 40 degrees
 jisase vahaan par duty karne vaale javaanon ko hypo or gangarine jaisi beemaari ho jaati hai or agar unka ilaaj sahi samay par nahin hota he to javaanon kii maut bhi ho jaati he

 andey ko power house kaha jaataa he, kyonki isamen sabhi prakaar ke jaruri nutrients paae jate hai
 Egg is very beneficial to build body and lose weight
 lekin phir bhi kai baar andey ko lekar kai logon kii raay alag-alag dekhne ko milti he
 Actually, the amount of cholesterol in the egg is very high, due to which many believe that the egg can harm health
 vahiin, kuch log vajan kam karne or 6 pack ebj banane ke liye andey ke sirf safed hisse kaa seven karte hai
 Let's know whether you should eat egg yolk to lose weight
 kya andey kii zardi sehat ko nuksaan pahunchaati he?ek andey main lagbhag 186 milligram cholesterol paaya jaataa he, jo andey kii zardi main maujuud hota he
 But it does not cause much harm to the body, because the body needs cholesterol to make testosterone hormone
 isse sharir main energy badhati he saath hi mansapeshiyaan bhi majboot hoti hai
 Several types of nutrients are found in an egg
 iske safed hisse main protein bharpoor maatra main paaya jaataa he
 Whereas, all other nutrients are found in egg yolk
 isamen aayran, vitamin bi-2, bi-12 or vitamin di paaya jaataa he, jo andey ke safed hisse main nahin hota he
 So if you eat only the white part of the egg, you will not be able to get the necessary nutrients in it
 uniwarsity of connecticut dwaara hui ek study kii report main bataaya gaya he ki andey kii zardi main maujuud fat sharir se bed cholesterol ko kam karata he
 If you want to lose weight, you can still consume egg yolk

 It is said that two of his men were killed in clashes with the army-police
 unhone iskaa badla lene ke liye or sarkaar ko chetavanee dene ke liye yah katleam kiya he
 The area where 23 people were killed is near the border of Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh
 yah bahut nirjan ilaaka he or yahaan jharkhand se aakar based hue adivasee zyada hai
 It is very easy to kill someone here because this place is far from the circle of security forces

 There are reports of communal violence, ethnic violence and other types of violence, but the state government and the Center never made any concrete and far-reaching plan to deal with them

 At one time, he was a downtrodden resident in Assam and people were settling on his land from outside, in response to which he used to do sporadic violence
 baad main unhone bodoland kii aawaaj uthaai jiske samaadhaan ke liye sarkaar ne bodoland teritorial autonomas districts banaaya
 But even this did not work, because it did not benefit the people there
 videshon se hathiyaar laakar vahaan ke ugravadiyon ne apana giroh bana liya
 Later, it too broke into two pieces and one faction is now bloodthirsty
 assam ke bare main kendra sarkaar ko ek visheshgy samiti banaakar vichaar karnaa hoga ki aakhir kaise is suramya or sundar rajya ko hinsamukt kiya ja saktaa he
 Here we have to think seriously about what can be done to end the enmity between many castes, religions, factions and residents
 sirf sena yaa suraksha bal bhej dene yaa kuch ugravadiyon ko pakad lene se kuch nahin hoga
 Assam is a very sensitive state and its problems are different from other states of India
 isliye vahaan kii samasya kaa samaadhaan alag tareeke se hi ho saktaa he
 This is not so easy and one has to work seriously for it

 He said, the kind of crisis they (janata Parivar parties) are facing, Congress is also doing
 bihar ham sab ke liye aglaa imtihaan he

 or agar bijepi bihar main roki jaati he, to mistar modi beasar ho jaaenge
 He said, therefore, i think the coming together of the Janata Parivar as a solidarity of the anti-bjp forces is a welcome development

 karnataka chunaavon main tipu sultan ek ahm mudda bana
 On this issue, the three major parties in the state, BJP, Congress and JDS left no stone unturned to garner votes
 karnataka ke maujuuda jila shrirangapattana, mysore, kurg or mangalore kii kul 9 vidhansabha kshetron ko tipu sultan kaa kshetra kaha ja saktaa he or inamen se 6 siton par kendra main sattarudh bijepi ne shandaar jeet darj kii
 While the Congress won 2 seats, the regional party JDS got support for its candidate in just one seat
 karnataka vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi ko 222 main 105 siton par jeet ke saath rajya kii sabase prabhaavshaalee party banane kaa mauka mila
 With these results, the BJP is exploring the possibility of forming a government in the 21st of the 29 states of the country, although the Congress and the JDS, sitting second, have taken the initiative to stop the BJP from forming a government in alliance
 kya karnataka chunaavon main tipu sultan mudda bana? beete paanch saal ke dauraan rajya main sattarudh congress party ne tipu sultan ko itihaas ke pannon se nikaal kar ek rashtravaadi chhavi dene kii koshish kii
 However, the ruling party at the center and the BJP sitting in opposition in the state strongly opposed it
 aisi sthiti main is sawaal kaa jawaab ki kya karnataka ke chunaavon main tipu sultan mudda bana yaa nahin kaa jawaab in 9 vidhansabha kshetron vaale jilon main janata kii voting se miltaa he
 Shringarangapatna: JDS candidate has been winning continuously in this field since 2004

 However, the power in this constituency has been between the Congress and the JDS
 tipu sultan ke kshetra main shrirangapattana behad ahm he
 There is a good number of Muslim voters in this area and this community stands in favor of the Congress's attempt to give a national image to Tipu Sultan
 iske baavjood congress ummidavaar ko is seat par is baar jeet hasil nahin ho saki
 Read this: People responded to PM Modi-misleading people on the results of Karnataka: Mysore: Mysore has been a region of Wodeyar dynasty
 is kshetra main kul teen vidhansabha siten krishnaraja, chamaraja or narsinmharaja aati he or narsinmharaja main muslim voter kii acchhee sankhya he
 The Sait family of the Congress has dominated this seat since 1999
 in chunaavon main ek baar phir congress ke tanwir sait ko chunaa gaya he
 At the same time, Congress candidates were winning both the other seats in Mysore region since 2013, but in these elections both seats have gone to bjp's account
 kurg:tipu sultan ke prabhaav kshetra main aglaa vidhansabha kshetra kurg yaa kodagu he
 The economy of this hilly region of Karnataka is dependent on coffee plantation
 is jile main do vidhansabha kshetra hai- virajpet or madikeri
 Both these seats have been dominated by the BJP for the past 15 years and once again BJP candidates have won both the seats
 mangaloru:tipu sultan ke prabhaav kshetra main aakhri jila mangaloru he
 The district comprises three assembly constituencies - Mangalore City North, Mangalore City South and Mangalore
 in teenon siton ko congress kaa majboot kila mana jaataa tha kyonki 2013 se lagaataar congress kaa varchasv in teenon siton par rahaa he
 However, in these elections, BJP has penetrated it and BJP candidates won in Mangalore City North as well as Mangalore City South, while Congress has been successful in saving Mangalore seat

 Why did Kapil Mishra congratulate Swati Maliwal? The Delhi government's water minister Kapil Mishra, in a gesture, described the Delhi Police as working according to the central government
 saath hi manch se sambodhan ke dauraan kapil mishra ne kaha, 'jaise hi mujhe pataa chalaa ki anti karpshan beuro ne exiaar darj kii he swati maliwal ke khilaaf
 i called Swati ji and congratulated her
 maine kaha ki mahila ayog acha kaam kar rahaa he, isliye aapke khilaaf exiaar darj hui he
 'police behaving like the British: Politics played on the platform of Jain Mahila Commission, Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain also played
 jain ne kaha, 'mujhe to lagata he ki ham aazaadee ke daur main pahunch gaye hai, jahaan police angrejon kii tarah bartaav kar rahi he
 The government wants to use the police as power, the police is being used to intimidate and suppress the public
 jabaki supreme court ne bhi police riform kii baat kahi he, lekin sarkaar police riform karnaa hi nahin chaahati
 'swati Maliwal should go to jail: Satyendra Janjain said,' i was asked by some media colleagues that cases are being registered against your people one after the other, why did i say that even before the elections in Delhi happened
 ab punjab or goa main chunaav he, to ye sab ho rahaa he

 Rijiju also praised Swati Maliwal's work and said, 'when Swati Maliwal first came to meet me on some issues related to the problem of women, i thought that she really wants to work
 maine abhi anual report puri tarah nahin padhi he, lekin sankshipt main jo bhi padhaa, wo bataata he ki mahilaon ke liye kaam ho rahaa he
 'till the time women are not safe, the country is not developed: a large number of cases of crime against women were registered in Rijiju 2014-15
 agar samaaj main samasya he, to use maananaa chahie
 Thinking of slander, one should not turn away from it
 agar maansikta or samaaj main badlaav nahin aayega, tab tak mahilaon ke prati aparaadh kam nahin hoga
 i keep telling the Delhi Police from time to time what steps should be taken, but the concern is that there has not been a reduction in crime per women
 desh kaa mantri hone ke naate mujhe dukh hota he ki itani koshishon ke baavjood abhi bhi mahilaon ke prati aparaadh main kami nahin ai he
 i will not consider this country a developed country until women are safe here

 The user wrote that his dog cookie always ate half the food and left half in the bowl for his fellow dog stitch
 kuki ke baad stitch usamen khaanaa khaati thi
 But the sad thing is that it is no longer a stitch, she died some time ago, but Cookie still leaves half the food for her in the bowl

 This politician who reached the floor with haste, could not save anyone's lost position, even the stronghold of the establishment, some leaders had 2019 election year
 raajnneetik gatividhiyon ke lihaaj se yah saal kaaphi uthapatak bharaa rahaa, jahaan kuch netaaon ne aasmaan kaa safar tay kiya to kuch netaa jameen par dharasai hokar gir gaye
 In the Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party led by Narendra Modi once again rose to the top of power and the country got a new Home Minister in the form of Amit Shah who changed the geographical and political map of India with his decisions
 vahiin kuch netaaon ke liye yah saal kisi bure sapane se kam nahin tha, aaiye aise hi kuch netaaon ke bare main jaanate hai jo is saal arsh se farsh par pahunch gaye
 Rahul Gandhi relinquished his presidency this year, taking responsibility for the Congress party's defeat in the Lok Sabha election
 haalanki party unhen adhyaksh banaae rakhana chaahati thi lekin lambii siyaasi jaddojahad ke baad aakhirkaar rahul ne congress adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya
 After this, the leadership of the Congress, which was devoid of leadership for some days, was again given in the hands of Sonia Gandhi, who is currently the interim president of the party
 is saal rahul gandhi ke haath se sirf congress adhyaksh pad hi nahin unki paramparaagat seat amethi bhi chali gai
 BJP leader Smriti Irani set off the sun of the Congress, which was considered invincible in Amethi
 rahul gandhi ko amethi main 55120 voton se shikast jhelni padi jo ki unke liye sabase bada siyaasi jhatka sabit hua
 However, the decision to contest from two seats proved to be correct and at this time Rahul Gandhi is representing the party in the Lok Sabha from Wayanad seat in Kerala
 siyaasi shikast ke saath-saath rahul gandhi ko is saal kanoonee daanv-pench main bhi haar hi mili
 Rahul Gandhi had to apologize in the Supreme Court for his Rafael statement during the election campaign
 yahi nahin unhen supreme court kii ore se fatkaar lagaai gai or aage se sanbhalkar bayaanbaji karne kii hidaayat bhi di gai he
 Apart from this, he continued to appear in different courts of the country in defamation cases throughout the year
 pi
 This year proved to be the worst for Chidambaram's home minister and finance minister p Chidambaram
 upie shashan main jis netaa kii tuuti bolti thi use 106 din tak tihaad jail kii hawa khaani padi
 In the INX money laundering case, Chidambaram was questioned several times by the ED and he was sent to judicial custody after which he could not get bail despite several appeals
 aakhirkaar supreme court ne 4 disambar ko chidambaram kii yachika par unhen sashart jamaanat di gai
 P
 in custody
 chidambaramchidambaram ko bhale hi ek cese main jamaanat mil gai ho lekin unpar giraftaar kii talwaar ab bhi lataki hui he
 Investigative agencies are also investigating other cases against the former home minister and they can again be detained for questioning
 haalanki kareeb teen maheene jail main rahane ke baad chidambaram ne baahar aate hi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa or arthvyavastha se lekar kashmir ke mudde par modi sarkaar kii aalochana kii
 Devendra Fadnavis: This year was the most uphill for the politics of Maharashtra
 phir se mukhyamantri banane ke 80 ghante baad hi devendra fadanvis ko siem pad se istipha dena padaa
 The bjp-shiv Sena alliance won a majority in the assembly elections, but the rivalry between the two parties for the post of Chief Minister increased so much that it broke the 30-year-old relationship with the Shiv Sena from the BJP
 iske baad maharashtra kii satta main vaapasi kar chuke fadanvis ko bahumat na hone kii vajah se satta chhodani padi or rajya main shivasena ne congress-ensipi kii madad se sarkaar bana lee
 Devendra Fadnavis was considered to be a fast emerging leader in the BJP but his haste to gain power backfired
 unhone sarkaar banane ke liye ensipi se baghawat karke gaye ajit pavaar par bharosa kiya jo baad main palati maar gaye
 Not only did the BJP lose power in this entire development, but Fadnavis also had to face gritty
 rajyapal ko istipha saunpte fadanviechdi kumaraswamikarnataka main pichley saal naatakeey siyaasi ghatnakram ke baad pehle bijepi ke bies yediurppa or phir jedies ke echdi kumaraswami mukhyamantri bane the
 However, this year Kumaraswamy had to resign from the post and again the command of the state has come in the hands of Yeddyurappa
 kumaraswami sirf 14 maheene ke liye karnataka ke mukhyamantri rahe or vidhayakon kii baghawat ke chale congress-jedies gathbandhan kii sarkaar vidhansabha main bahumat sabit nahin kar pai
 Ever since assuming office as Chief Minister, disputes between Congress and JDS, allies of power in Karnataka, became common
 congress ne duusari number kii party hote hue bhi bijepi ko rokane ke liye tisare number kii party jedies ko mukhyamantri pad de diya tha
 Thereafter, there was resentment towards the Kumaraswamy government in the Congress camp continuously, which ended with the fall of the Kumaraswamy government
 jyotiraditya sindhiyagwalior rajgaraane se aane vaale congress ke netaa or purv mantri jyotiraditya sindhiya ke liye bhi yah saal acha sabit nahin hua
 In the Lok Sabha elections, he had to lose by one lakh from his traditional seat Guna and no one to defeat him but his predecessor was Krishna Pal Yadav, who left the Congress and joined the BJP ticket
 sindhiya is seat se 4 baar saansad rahe, yahi nahin unke pita madhav raav sindhiya bhi guna se 4 baar saansad rah chuke the lekin is baar unhen apana garh ganvaana pad gaya
 Scindia was given the responsibility to lead the Congress in UP along with Priyanka Gandhi in the Lok Sabha elections
 unhen pashchimi upi kaa prabhavi banaaya gaya tha jahaan party kaa supada saaf ho gaya
 Congress got only one seat in UP, that too was Sonia Gandhi's Rae Bareli seat
 rahul gandhi ke kareebi maane jane vaale sindhiya ab dilli se dur ho chuke hai or unhone khud ko madhya pradesh tak simit kar liya he
 Navjot Singh Sidhu has always been identified as the leader of the controversy, Navjot Singh Sidhu has suffered many setbacks this year
 unka siyaasi kad to kam hua hi saath hi vivaadon kii vajah se unhen peshewar nuksaan bhi uthaanaa padaa
 Sidhu, who became a minister in the Congress government of Punjab, resigned from his post in July this year
 captain amarindan singh ne pehle unka vibhaag badla jiske baad bagaiyr kaarybhaar sanbhale siddhu ne mantri pad chhod diya
 Navjot Singh Siddhusiddhu was heavily struck by the friendship between Pakistan and Imran Khan, which he suffered on many fronts
 kapil sharma ke kamedi sho main bataur jaj kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe siddhu ko soni tivi ne is jimmedaari se mukt kar diya
 At the same time, he received criticism from not only the opposition party BJP but also from his own people for praising Imran Khan
 philhal siddhu kaa siyaasi bhavishya adhar main he or vah party kii gatividhiyon se dur najar aa rahe hai
 Jayant Sinha, who made headlines as a minister in the first term of the Jayant Sinhamodi government, lost his shine this year
 unhen hazaribagh loksabhaa seat se jeet to mili lekin mantrimandal main jagah paane main vifaltaa hasil hui
 In the previous government, he was Minister of State for Finance and Minister of Civil Aviation and his work was appreciated, despite Modi 2
 0 main jayant sinha ko sarkaar se baahar rakhaa gaya
 Sinha worked in the Finance Ministry as Arun Jaitley's junior minister in the previous government
 saath hi vimaanan mantri rahete hue udaan jaise hawaii yojana shuru karne kaa shrey unhen hi diya jaataa he
 But this time Sinha has been missing from the media as well as the headlines
 rajyavardhan singh rathorapurv olympian rajyavardhan rathore ne modi sarkaar ke pehle kaarykaal main khel mantralay ke saath-saath soochna or prasaaran jaisaa ahm mantralay sambhala tha lekin is saal nai sarkaar ke gathan ke baad unka patta cat gaya he
 In his place, Kiran Rijiju, who was the Minister of State for Home Affairs in the previous government, has got the responsibility of the Sports Ministry
 bharat ke purv captain or 'e' team ke coach rahul dravid kaa maananaa he ki yadi mahendra singh dhoni 2019 worldcup kii team main khud ko nahin dekhte to captaini chhodane kii unki timming sahi thi
 Dravid said, "dhoni's decision is not too surprising
 use pataa tha ki yah hona hi he
 There was speculation that he would hold the post till the Champions Trophy but before that there was only one ODI series
 ’dravid ne iespien crickinfo se kaha, ‘uske najariye se dekhen to agar vah khud ko agle worldcup kii team main nahin dekhtaa to uski timming sahi he
 This is the right time to hand over the reins to Virat Kohli so that he gets time to prepare his team for the next World Cup
 ’ He said, 'there is no doubt that when an experienced and capable cricketer like MS Dhoni is in form, it is priceless for the team
 uske paas apaar anubhav or kshamta he, khaskar dabaav ke kshanon main
 It is not easily found
 ’ unhone kaha,‘sawaal yahi he ki aapako team main apni jagah banani padati he or pradarshan ke dam par
 If he is in form and playing well then a player like Dhoni is priceless for India, especially when big tournaments are coming
 ’ tippaniyan Dravid said that Dhoni's form would be an issue before the big tournaments

 Mumbai is constantly raining, so water is constantly flowing on many bridges which is scaring people
 ek chashmadid ne bataaya ki ye brij kareeb 50-60 saal purana he

 beete 23 april ko gwalior kii ek clinics main avaidh rup se garbhpaat karaane kaa maamla saamne aayaa
 Two days later, on 25 April, a case of gender-testing of the fetus of a pregnant woman with a portable ultrasound machine emerged in another area of the city
 gwalior-chambal ilaake main 140 registerd ultrasound clinics hai
 The government monitors them through a machine called Active Tracker
 sarkari nigaraanee ke kaaran ilaake main ling pareekshan karne waalon ke liye din-ba-din mushkil badhati ja rahi thi
 In such a situation, these people started using portable ultrasound machine made in China
 iskaa khulaasa us vakt hua jab saraswati nagar sthit ek makaan main kapil pandey naam kaa vyakti ling pareekshan karte pakadaa gaya
 To catch the accused red handed, the woman and child development department sent a woman here as a fake customer
 vah saat hajaar ru
 Lekar was testing that the collector of Gwalior P
W
 narhari ne yahaan chapa maar diya
 a portable ultrasound machine was recovered from here
 ek anya ghatana main gwalior ke gola kaa mandir ilaake main sthit happy clinics main ek mahila kaa garbhpaat kiya ja rahaa tha kyonki uske pet main pal rahaa bhrun ek ladki kaa tha
 This nursing home belongs to an alleged hawkish doctor named Dilip Mishra
 prashasan kii team ne jis vakt chapa maaraa, suman naam kii nurse mahila kaa garbhpaat karne ja rahi thi
 Investigation revealed that Mishra had deployed agents in several towns in Morena
 ye log ling pareekshan karavaate the or garbh main ladki hone par mahila ko mishra ke gwalior sthit clinics main garbhpaat ke liye bhej dete the
 "in these cases, action is being taken under the pre-conception and pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques Act," says Narhari
 '' ve is tarah ke maamalon main swasthya vibhaag kii mileebhagat se inkaar nahin karte balki kehete hai, ''donon ghatnaon main chapa pehle prashasan ne maaraa
 Information was later given to the Health Department
 aisa kai baar hua jab swasthya vibhaag ko karrwai karne bheja gaya lekin uske adhikari khaali haath aae
 "there are only 831 girls in gwalior-chambal as against one thousand boys, while in the state the figure is 912
" mahila or bal vikaas vibhaag ke sanyukt sanchaalak suresh tomars ke mutabik, ilaake main avaidh garbhpaat kii pramukh vajah garbh main ladki kaa hona hota he
 He says, "A year ago, ultrasound machines in nursing homes have been linked to active trackers
 ab har ultrasound kaa record rakhaa jaataa he
 Earlier 32,000 ultrasounds were recorded in a year, now their number has crossed 73,000
 ''portable ultrasound mashin bhrun pareekshan rokane ke rajya sarkaar ke prayaason par pani pher rahi he
 Due to this machine being small and inexpensive, it has now become easier for people involved in this business to have a gender test
 clinics main lagane vaali ultrasound mashin kii keemat das lakh ru
 While a China-made portable ultrasound machine costs just Rs 2 lakh
 main mil jaati he
 The state government has no system for registration of these portable machines
 na hi inhen trek karne kaa koi tarika
 These machines are brought from Delhi and agents give them to fake doctors in very secretive ways

 " dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne 2019 ke aam chunaavon ko lekar apni ranneeti main badlaav kiya he
 AAP leaders and political observers say that for the 2019 general elections, Kejriwal has changed his strategy for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attack
 2017 main punjab main 'aap' ke kharaab pradarshan tathaa uttar pradesh main bijepi dwaara anya dalon kaa supada saaf kar die jane ke baad kejariwal ne pradhanmantri narendra modi par apane hamalon kii tivrata kam karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 Kejriwal persisted on this strategy for more than a year, but in view of the recent electoral defeat of the BJP and the 'growing' anti-incumbency against the BJP government at the Center, Kejriwal once again attacked Modi Have decided to intensify the attacks
 'aap' ke ek varisht netaa ne kaha ki uttar pradesh ke chunaav parinaam ke baad 2017 main kejariwal ne jab apni ranneeti main badlaav kiya to tab modi kaa karishma barkaraar tha
 You do not attack a leader who is popular because it has the opposite effect, but now that he (modi) is becoming unpopular, the strategy has changed
 unhone kaha ki petrol - dijal ke daamon main vruddhi ke chalate modi sarkaar ke khilaaf logon ke gusse, haalia upachunaavon main bijepi kii haar tathaa bijepi ke khilaaf vipaksh ke ekajute hone kii vajah se kejariwal ne ranneeti badal lee he
 In the recent by-elections for 4 seats of the Lok Sabha, BJP had only one seat in its account
 vahiin 10 vidhansabha siton par hue upachunaav main se bhi uske jholii main keval ek seat ai thi
 After this, Kejriwal cautiously praised former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in a tweet which he had targeted during the 2013 Delhi Assembly elections under his anti-corruption campaign
 uske baad 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan bhi kejariwal ne manmohan ko nishaanaa banaaya tha
 Attacking Modi, Kejriwal said that people are missing the 'educated Prime Minister' like Manmohan Singh
 upachunaav parinaam ke baad kejariwal ne kaha tha ki parinaam pradhanmantri ke khilaaf logon ke gusse ko dikhaate hai
 Political analyst Sanjay Kumar said that when a leader is popular then attacking him will have the opposite effect
 ab jab vipaksh modi ke khilaaf ekajute ho rahaa he , upachunaav parinaam jab satta virdohi lahar dikhaate hai , to unhen (kejariwal) phayda dikh rahaa he or vah hamale kar rahe hai
 According to news agency PTI, Saurabh Bhardwaj, spokesperson of aap's Delhi unit, said that Kejriwal is a human being and he will strike back
 dilli sarkaar ko kaam nahin karne diya gaya he
 Bhardwaj said that we have also tried to adopt a strategy to reduce our attacks and concentrate on work, but the incidents in the last one year show that this strategy has not worked

 At the same time, replacing the declared candidates with votes that can draw votes, it also raises doubts whether in the absence of a strong ally as in 2001 (GK Moopanar's TMC and Congress and others) and 2011 (DMK and others) Will Jayalalithaa win the election alone?

 The year 2017 is going off with a lot of sour memories in India's relations with Pakistan and China
 yah saal pakistan or china ke khilaaf kootnithik drushti se bharat ke liye behad ahm sabit hua
 Due to the Modi government's diplomacy, Pakistan and China had to face many fronts
 bharat ne antarrashtriya str par china kii kai chalbaasiyon ko naakaam kiya
 This caused many setbacks to China's plans to surround India
 maaloom ho ki china bharat kii chaaron ore se gheraa bandi karne kii lambey samay se koshish kar rahaa he
 He calls his plan 'the rosary of beads', that is, to surround India like a garland of pearls
 iske jariye vahahind mahaasagaramen apni majboot pakad banane kii koshish main he
 However, this year India gave a big blow to this effort
 china pakistan aarthik galiyara (CPEC) ke tahat china pakistan ke guadar main bandargah bana rahaa he, jiske jawaab main bharat ne oman kii khadi main chabahaar bandargah viksit kar rahaa he
 It has also been inaugurated recently
 yahbandargah guadarase mahaj 85 kimi dur he
 With this, India will be able to reach Afghanistan without going to Pakistan
 philhal bharat ko afghanistan jane ke liye pakistan se hokar guzarana padataa tha
 Will not have to do this now
 iske alaava bharat srilanka ke us antarrashtriya hawaii adde ko apane niyantran main karne ja rahaa he, jisko chaar saal pehle china kii madad se viksit kiya gaya tha
 This will shock China's One Belt One Route (OBOR) project i
e
 China will not be able to connect to Sri Lanka by air
 aaie jaanate hai ki is saal modi sarkaar ke kin kadamon ne pakistan or china kii chintaa badhaai
 
 
 
 chabahaar bandargahiran ke dakshin purv menoman kii khadimen sthiti yah bandargah samrik najariye se bharat, afghanistan or iran samet kai deshon ke liye ahm he
 It is just 85 km from China's Gwadar port in Pakistan
 guadar bandargah ko china CPEC ke tahat viksit kar rahaa he
 Through this, it is also trying to penetrate into the Indian Ocean
 vahiin, ab bharat guadar ke jawaab main chabahaar ko viksit kar rahaa he
 Chabahar is the first foreign port in which India has direct involvement
 isi saal iran ke raashtrapati hasan ruhani ne chabahaar bandargah kaa udghaatan kiya
 During this, 90 representatives from 17 countries including India were involved
 is bandargah ke shuru hone se bharat sidhe afghanistan or madhya asia tak apni pahunch bana sakegaa
 He will not have to pass through Pakistan to go to Afghanistan
 saal 2003 main bharat ne isko lekar qaraar kiya tha, lekin is saal iske nirmaan main kaaphi teji ai or yah ab jald shuru ho jayega
 Sri Lanka's Mattala International Airport is going to take control of Mattala International Airport in Sri Lanka, which is a matter of concern for China
 is hawaii adde ko srilanka kii mahindra rajpakshe sarkaar ne apane shasankaal main china kii madad se viksit kiya tha
 The number of passengers here is extremely low, due to which it is running in deficit
 ab isko bharat apane niyantran main lene vaala he yani agle 40 saal ke liye is hawaii adde kaa adhikaar jald hi bharat ko mil jayega
 It is located just 18 km from the port of Hambantota in Sri Lanka
 is bandargah ko china ne 99 saal ke liye lij par le rakhaa he
 China is also building an industrial zone here
 china hind mahaasaagar main bharat ko gherne ke liye yahaan nivesh kar rahaa he
 In response, now 20 at India Mattala Airport
 5 karod dollar kaa nivesh karne ja rahaa he
 India's share in this will be 70 percent
 iskaa sanchaalan bharat ko milane se china hawaii maarg se china se jud nahin paaegaa
 Apart from this, due to the diplomacy of the Modi government, Sri Lanka has decided to keep the security of Hambantota with China instead of itself
 saath hi yahaan par china ke sainya jahaajon ke thaharne ke rukne par bhi pratibandh laga diya he
 Close proximity between Israel and India This year was the name of the relationship between Israel and India
 donon desh pehali baar behad kareeb aae
 The two countries also celebrated the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations in a spectacular manner
 pradhanmantri narendra modi july 2017 main khud isroyal gaye
 With this, he became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Israel
 is dauraan donon deshon ke bich antariksh, raksha or krishi takneekee ke kshetra main kareeb saat qaraar hue
 ISRO and Israel Space Agency (ISA) will now also work to increase mutual cooperation
 isroyal se jal shuddhikarantakanic bhi bharat ko milegi
 It is known that Israel is at the forefront of technology
 bharat or isroyal ke kareeb aane se china or pakistan kii bhi bechaini bad gai he
 This is the reason why media attention of China and Pakistan remained focused on Modi's visit to Israel
 pakistani media ne to yahaan tak kah diya ki bharat or isroyal uske khilaaf sajeesh rach rahe hai
 India's diplomatic victory over the Doklam dispute: Doklam was not only a border dispute, but also a test of supremacy in South Asia, in which India won a resounding victory and China suffered
 modi sarkaar kii kootneeti ke aage china ko jhukna padaa or kareeb dhai maheene ke gatirodh ke baad chini sena ko doklam seemaa se peeche hatana padaa
 Although the Doklam controversy was created by China, but when it started troubling the world, it fell on the backfoot
 kulbhushan jadhav maamle par PAK ko ICJ main ghaseetnabhartiya nausena ke purv adhikarikulbhushan jadhavamaamle main bharat ne pakistan ko karaari shikast di
 When Pakistan sentenced Jadhav to death by falsely accusing him of being involved in terrorism and subversive activities, India dragged him to the International Court of Justice (ICJ)
 ICJ ne kulbhushan ko faansee dene par roak laga di
 After this, under the global pressure, Pakistan had to meet Kulbhushan Jadhav with his mother and wife
 jadhav maamle ko lekar pakistan ko antarrashtriya str par na sirf ghutane techne pade, balki fajihat bhi jhelni padi
 In the case of Hafiz Saeed, the pressure with the US to form a pressure on the Mumbai terror attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed proved to be extremely fatal for the year
 bharat or america ke dabaav main aakar pakistan ko hafiz said ko kareeb 10 maheene tak najarband karnaa padaa
 Due to this, the reality of giving protection to the terrorists of Pakistan has once again come in front of the world
 is dauraan aatankwaad ke masale ko lekar america or pakistan ke rishton main bhi kadavaahat ai
 This gave a major breakthrough in the direction of isolating Pakistan internationally
 myanmar ke saath nae yug kii shuruyatis saal bharat auramyanmar ke rishton cholekar behad khaas rahaa
 India and Myanmar have a border of about 1600 km, but so far the two countries do not have a very close relationship
 lihaaja iskaa sidhaa phayda china uthaata rahaa
 China is Myanmar's largest trading partner
 saath hi myanmar main sabase zyada nivesh bhi china karata he
 The Modi government increased its proximity to Myanmar this year
 sitambar 2017 main piem modi khud myanmar ke daure par gaye or donon deshon ke bich raksha or vyapaar samet 11 samjhauton par hastakshar hue
 India's move has been worrying for China
 bharat or myanmar ke bich vyapaarik or raksha sambandh majboot hone se china ko nuksaan hona tay he
 In such a situation, China can never be happy with the strong relationship between the two countries

 (let us tell you that in these by-elections in Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Kairana, BJP has lost) arun jetali nahin rahe
 Within a month, BJP has received its second major setback
 isi maheene kii shuruyaat main sushamaa swaraj kaa nidhan ho gaya tha
 Jaitley and Swaraj had their own merits
 narendra modi kii aguwai vaali pichhali sarkaar main jab jetali (arun Jaitley) mantri the, to ve aksar sarkaar ke sankatmochak kii bhoomika main najar aate
 Whatever the issue may be, Jaitley would surely have the answer
 rafel jaise pechida maamle par jab vipaksh ne modi sarkaar ko katghare main khadaa kiya, to rakshaamantri se pehle arun jetali (arun Jaitley) in hamalon kaa jawaab dene ke liye maidan main khadey dikhaai diye
 Many more occasions came when Jaitley gave 'oxygen' to the tearful breath of the government
 haalanki yah bhi sahi he ki jetali ne apni siyaasi pari kii shuruyaat chaatr jivan se kii
 He also went to jail during the Emergency, but he never became a 'jananeta'
 apni 4 dashak se zyada kii raajnneetik pari main ve ek baar loksabhaa kaa chunaav lade, lekin haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Despite this, Jaitley's glow never faded
 aise vakt main, jab unke saath ke kai netaa nepathy main chale gaye yaa dhakel diye gaye, baavjood iske jetali kii aakhir tak puch rahi
 Just before the Lok Sabha elections this year, Jaitley himself refused to take any position citing health reasons
 khabar ai ki bijepi ke tamaam netaaon ne unase is faisle par vichaar karne kaa aagrah kiya
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself also spoke to him on this issue
 haalanki, jetali ke girte swasthya ne unhen isaki ijaajat nahin di
 Arun Jaitley remained 'important' in the party till the end, there were many reasons
 unhen kanoon or siyasat kii jitani baarik samaj thi, usase kahin zyada samaj 'rishton' kii thi
 He was well versed in 'lutyens' and 'raisina' in every way and manner of Delhi
 koun sa taala kis chaabi se khulata he, yah acchhee tarah pataa tha
 And when you have the key to each and every lock, what else is there in politics? Sushma Swaraj had a different mood than Jaitley
 ve 'lutiuns dilli' main raheen, lekin yaheen kii hokar nahin rah gayi
 Often this distance becomes a 'moat' for the leaders after covering the distance of Delhi from the Lok Sabha constituency, which is never cracked nor attempts are made to bridge it, but Sushma Swaraj presented Nazir in this case Of
 unhone apni siyaasi pari ke dauraan 'raajnneetik krurta' ko apane paas fatakane tak nahin diya
 While the foreign minister in the previous Central Government, he instilled confidence among the seven seaside Indians that the country stood by him on a tweet, listening to their suffering
 aise maukey bhi aae jab sushamaa swaraj ko khud apni party ke kai netaaon kii aalochana jhelni padi or soshal media par unhen trol kiya gaya, lekin is tarah ke har maukey par unka dil 'bada' najar aayaa
 Now both Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley are no more
 unke saath hi 'dil or dimag' se kaam karne vaale netaaon kaa ek daur bhi chalaa gaya
 The predetermined pitch has been changed just before the T20 match between India and Australia in Mohali today
 ye badlaav indian team management ke anurodh ke baad kiya gaya he

 Which was accepted by the management and the pitch was changed for the match
 team india ne kiya tha anurodhdarasal khabaron kii maane to mohali main ajbharat or australiake bich usee pich par muqabla hona tha, jis par pakistan or australia ke bich hua tha
 But Team India did not want to play on this pitch and after which the pitch has been changed now
 BCCI kii takat jagajaahirgauratlab he ki world cap jaise muqablon ke liye isisi ke curator hi pich taiyaar karte hai
 However, questions about changing the pitch in Mohali may also arise as to why the pitch was changed on the demand of the team? But bcci's strength in world cricket is not hidden from anyone
 isisi ko bhi bisisiai kii takat kaa ehsaas he

 In the hot summer, they go to the fort with the tourists up
 lohe kii zanjeeron ke kaaran haathiyon ko chot lagi rahati he
 On these arguments, the court asked Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar, appearing for the Central Government, that the Union Ministry of Environment would also play a role in this
 ranjit kumaar ne kaha ki yah maamla rajya ke adhikaar kshetra main aata he
 However, he also said that a walk (joy ride) on elephants does not violate any law
 tippaniyan There is a very old tradition of walks on elephants in Rajasthan
