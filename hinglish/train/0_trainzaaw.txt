 The Modi government brought an electoral bond scheme aimed at bringing transparency in Indian politics funding
 kya sarkaar is yojana ko apane hisaab se mode rahi he jisase ki virdohi dalon ko iskaa laabh naa mil sake
 The Congress has accused the government of acting maliciously in this case
 darasal, modi sarkaar ke bahucharchit elactoral funding sudhaaron ke tahat raajnneetik dalon ko chanda dene ke liye elactoral bond kii bikri ke liye jo 11 centre banaae gaye hai, unamem se 7 bijepi shasit rajyon kii rajdhaniyon main khole gaye
 Of the seven new centers opened in April this year, 6 are in bjp-ruled states
 nai yojana ke tahat chande se labhanvit hone vaali partiyon ke naam saarvajanik nahin kiye ja sakate
 The NDA government notified the electoral bond scheme in January this year
 pehle phej main bhartiya state bank kii shakhaon ko elactoral bond kii bikri ke liye adhikrut kiya gaya
 These bonds were made available for sale in four metros - Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata in denominations of one thousand, ten thousand, one lakh, ten lakh and one crore rupees
 duusare phej main april main saat nae centre khole gaye
 Of these, six were opened in bjp-ruled state capitals i
e
 Gandhinagar, Lucknow, Jaipur, Chandigarh, Bhopal and Guwahati
 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle bengalooru main centre kholaa gaya jahaan se sirf chunaav vaale may ke maheene main hi 38 karod rupye ke bond bike
 a total of 51 in April and May in Bengaluru
 8 karod rupye ke bond bike
 The opposition is concerned as to why Hyderabad, Thiruvananthapuram, Patna and Bhubaneswar were ignored in opening centers for the sale of electoral bonds
 gaiyr bijepi shasit rajyon jaise ki andhra pradesh, telugana, odisha main bonds kii bikri kii anumati nahin di gai
 All these states have governments of regional parties
 yahaan tak ki bihar main bhi kisi branch ko adhikrut nahin kiya gaya
 Here JDU is a senior partner in JDU-BJP coalition government
 elactoral bond state bank kii adhikrut shakha main khud jane par hi kharide ja sakate hai
 The opposition has also expressed fears that in the election year, the government can decide in which cities bonds should be sold
 mukhya vipakshi party congress kaa aarope he ki modi sarkaar yojana ko apane hisaab se mode rahi he jisase dusron ko laabh naa mili
 Randeep Surjewala, in charge of the Congress Communications Department, told India Today TV, "why are the centers not being opened in non-bjp ruled states like Andhra Pradesh
 durbhaavna saaf he
 We demand that the name of each donor be made public
 
 
 
 Only by doing so can we move forward
 ”artiai se mili jaankaree ke mutabik pehle teen maheene main mumbai se sabase zyada (213 karod rupye) mulya ke elactoral bond bike
 With Mumbai being the commercial capital of the country, it has the largest corporate base here
 anya shaharon main elactoral bond kii bikri is tarah rahi- dilli (73
 6 crores), Kolkata (70 crores), Bengaluru (51
 8 karod), chennai (18 karod) or gandhinagar (12 crores)
 51 in Bengaluru
 8 karod main se 38
 9 crores came only in the election month of May
 april main jin saat shaharon main yojana shuru kii gai thi unamem se keval bengalooru or gandhinagar main hi bond kharide gaye
 The remaining 5 other capitals did not sell a single bond
 tex laabh uthaane ke liye akele march main hi 222 karod rupye ke 520 bond bike
 114 in April
 9 karod rupye ke 256 bond kii bikri hui
 101 in May
 4 karod ke 204 bond bike
 Of the total donations received by political parties from Electoral Trusts in 2016-17, BJP alone accounted for 89
 22 fisadi yani 290
 22 crores received
 farvari 2017 ke bajet main vitt mantri arun jetali ne prastaav kiya tha ki nakad main koi bhi raajnneetik dal adhiktam 2000 rupye kaa chanda hi hasil kar saktaa he
 In addition to the electoral bonds, parties can also receive donations from digital and checks
 lekin corporate apana naam gupt rakhane ke liye elactoral bond skim ko chun sakate hai
 Which party got the benefit of donations from electoral bonds, now this identity will be hidden
 bijepi pravaktaa sudhanshu mittal ke mutabik sarkaar kii manshaa saaf or eemaandaar he
 Mittal said, "bonds can be bought anywhere from the bank
 koi bhi kisi adhikrut branch se check se bond kharid saktaa he
 The donor in the balance sheet will show the value of the bonds, but to whom it is given will remain secret
 kyonki ye vaid paisa he isliye isko lekar aarope lagaana bachakaana he
 “the Modi government claims that the electoral bond scheme has been brought in to make political funding transparent
 sarkaar ke mutabik is yojana kaa lakshya aniyantrit raajnneetik funding ko khatm karnaa he jisamen kaale dhan kaa bada hissaa chunavi prakriya main aata he
 Experts consider this to be a secret agenda
 unka aarope he ki yojana paardarshee nahin he
 The ruling party can easily find out which political party has donated to which political party
 association for democratic riforms ke sansthaapak sadsy professor jagadeep chhokar ne india today se kaha- “puri yojana khaas makasad se laai gai he jisase ki corporate puri gopneeyata se raajnneetik dalon ko chanda de saken
 They should not come to the knowledge of anyone and at the same time the money flow can be tied up as a donation to the opposing parties
 yojana ke yahi do sambhav uddeshy hai or donon hi isse puure hote hai
 Data from the sale of electoral bonds shows that there is not much demand for small-value bonds
 99
 7 per cent of the bonds have been bought in denominations of one million or one crore
 isse pataa chalata he ki keval dhankuber hi raajnneetik dalon ko chanda de rahe hai
 One crore bond share 384 crore (87
 6%) or das lakh rupye vaale bonds kii hissedari 53
 9 crores (12
 3%) rahi

 bahujan samaaj party (basapa) pramukh mayawati ne narendra modi sarkaar kii teen saal kii uplabdhiyon ko naganya bataate hue kaha he ki beete teen saalon main kendra sarkaar ne koi kaam nahin kiya sirf badi-badi baaten kii hai
 Mayawati's statement issued by BSP has also accused the Modi government of using public money as a pretext to publicize the achievements of three years through government advertisements
 unhone kaha ki beete teen saalon main modi sarkaar kii dalit or alpsankhyak virdohi nitiyon ke kaaran na sirf desh main saamaajik samarasata kaa tanabana buree tarah se prabhavit hua he balki galat aarthik nitiyon ke kaaran amir or garib ke bich kii khai or bhi zyada bad gai he
 The comments mayawati ne kaha ki kendra sarkaar ke teen saal ke kaamkaaj kaa akalan karne par saaf mahasoos hota he ki samaaj ke kamjor or dalit tabake ke log garibi ke dushchakra main funs gaye hai jabaki amir varg ke log lagaataar dhanadya hote ja rahe hai
 He said that the ever-increasing inflation, unemployment and ethnic and communal violence across the country is enough to clarify the reality of the Modi government's claims of changing the country
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar kisaan, majdoor, dalit or alpsankhyakon kii badahaali ko chupaane ke liye vikaas ke bade bade daavon ko sach sabit karne ke liye sarkari vigyapanon kaa sahaara le rahi he
 For this, the government has adopted a policy of spending a lot of money on advertisements
 mayawati ne kaha ki pichley teen saalon main modi sarkaar ne sirf mumahamedha bhar puunjipatiyon ko hi laabh pahunchaaya he
 Mayawati said that "the furore and terror of the saffron brigade against innocent Dalits and minorities in the name of cow protection is the responsibility of the Modi government"

 He said that in the last three years, the anti-dalit and minority policies of the Modi government have not only affected the social harmony in the country badly, but due to wrong economic policies, the gap between rich and poor has increased even more
 
 tippaniyan Mayawati said that after assessing the three years of functioning of the central government, it is clear that the weaker and downtrodden sections of the society are trapped in the vicious circle of poverty while the rich people are becoming increasingly wealthy
 unhone kaha ki desh bhar main lagaataar badhati manhagaai, berogari or jaateey evam sampradayik hinsa modi sarkaar ke desh badalane ke daavon kii hakeekat ko spasht karne ke liye kaaphi he
 He said that to hide the plight of farmers, laborers, Dalits and minorities, the government is resorting to government advertisements to prove the big claims of development to be true
 iske liye sarkaar ne vigyapanon par akut dhan kharch karne kii niti apanaayi he
 Mayawati said that in the last three years, the Modi government has benefited only the capitalists all over the world
 mayawati ne kaha ki ‘‘goraksha ke naam par nirdosh daliton or alpsankhyakon ke khilaaf bhagava brigade kaa updrav or aatank modi sarkaar kii hi dein he
 Due to this, the expectation of justice in the public is constantly falling, which is a dangerous sign for a better future in the interest of the country

 bijepi kaa ahankaar loksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar ke baad hi jayega
 Criticizing the policies of the NDA government of the Center, BSP chief Mayawati said on Wednesday that such wrong policies and egoistic attitude have neither done the country good nor anything good is going to happen next
 piem narendra modi dwaara nae saal main die gaye pehle saakshaatkaar main kahi gai baton par pratikriya dete hue mayawati ne ek bayaan main kaha ''bhaajapa abhi bhi yahi maanakar chal rahi he ki uskaa bahumat kaa ahankaar uchit va har prakaar se sahi he tathaa uske dwaara liye gaye har faisle par log khush hai va taaliyaan baja rahe hai
 It seems that what has happened when the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan has gone, in terms of vote percentage, the BJP has actually been almost equal to the Congress
 ''mayawati ne kaha ki bijepi ke sheersh netritv kii is prakaar kii hathili va janvirohi soch yah sabit karti he ki uskaa ahankaar abhi bhi kaayam he jo loksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar ke baad hi jayega
 The BSP chief said, "after gradually separating all the major constituents from the NDA, the remaining parties are saddened by their narrow and egoistic attitude

 He said that in view of the uncertainty in the direction of inflation in the near future and the weak state of the economy, the Reserve Bank decided not to be 'over-reactive' in policy steps

 Rajan said that the slight increase in gross domestic product (GDP) recorded in the second quarter is more related to better agricultural production, as manufacturing output has been lower
 isliye vikaas dar main teji ke saamne chunautiyaan bani hui hai
 Putting the ball in the central government's court to accelerate investment, the governor said, in this situation it is necessary to reactivate blocked investment, especially in projects approved by the Cabinet Committee on Investment

 In this regard, the strategic agreement between the Congress and the CPM in West Bengal is being decided
 rajya main sattadhari tiemasi or centre main sattadhari bijepi se naaraaz voton kaa vibhaajan rokane ke liye mana ja rahaa he ki sipiem bengal kii sabhi 42 siton par apane ummidavaar nahin khadey karegi
 The Congress and CPM units of the state have been advocating this agreement for some time
 ek angreji akhbaar main chhapi report ke mutabik kolkata main shuukravaar or shanivaar ko hui sipiem paulitte beuro kii meeting main congress ke saath samjhaute par charchaa hui
 So in the national capital Delhi, Congress President Rahul Gandhi held a meeting with all the state presidents and legislature party leaders
 is baithak ke baad bengal congress ke adhyaksh somen mitra ne kaha ki party apni garima kaa tyaag kiye bina left ke saath samjhauta karnaa chaahati he
 So far, the cpm's Kerala unit, which has been opposing any agreement with the Congress, has also softened
 sipiem kii kerala ikai ke sachiv kodiari balakrishnan ne kaha ki agle loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko satta se bedakhal karnaa he to iske liye sabhi ranneetik kadam uthaane honge
 The Congress has also clearly announced this method
 unhone kaha ki april 2018 main congress or sipiem paulitte beuro ne yah tay kiya tha ki bijepi or uske sahyogi dalon ko haraana mukhya lakshya he, lekin paulitte beuro main yah bhi tay hua tha ki yah congress ke saath kisi raajnneetik gathjod ke bina hoga
 Although the party had kept the options open for West Bengal, it was argued that non-bjp, non-tmc votes should be unified as much as possible
 kya bole seetaram yechurishanivaar ko media se baatcheet main sipiem mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki bengal main jahaan vam dalon ke ummidavaar nahin hai, vahaan ham bijepi or trinmul congress ko haraane ranneeti par kaam karenge
 Our aim is to unite the angry votes from BJP and TMC more and more
 unhone kaha ki vam dal is baat par charchaa kar rahe hai ki kin jagahon par ummidavaar khadey karne hai
 According to sources, there are at least four seats where the Left cannot field its candidates
 congress ke paas is samay pashchim bengal ke-jangipur, uttar malda, dakshin malda or baharaampur se 4 saansad hai

 The result of this election was not as expected as the Congress and the CPM had expected
 lekin congress kaa pradarshan sipiem se behatar rahaa
 The Congress emerged as the second largest party with 44 seats in this election, while the Left parties, which once ruled West Bengal, were reduced to 33 seats
 aapako bataa den ki pashchim bengal kii congress ikai tiemasi ke khilaaf aawaaj buland karti rahi he
 Former state Congress president and MP Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary has been making frequent statements against Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee

 But the state unit of the party continued to make the Congress president aware of how the TMC is weakening the party in the state
 udhar mamata banerjee pehle hi kah chuki hai ki unke liye rajya ke congress netaa myne nahin rakhte kyonki party ke rashtriya netritv tiemasi kii vipakshi dalon ko ekajute karne kii bhoomika kaa prashansak rahaa he
 In the last few years in West Bengal, there has been a tremendous jump in the bjp's graph and in the public opinion, the party has managed to prove itself as the main opposition party
 lihaaja bengal main yah chunaav bijepi banaam tiemasi hona tay mana ja rahaa tha
 But if a compromise is reached between the congress-cpm, the contest may be triangular

 Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana on Monday filed a case in Tis Hazari Court accusing Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's wife Sunita Kejriwal of possessing two voter cards
 unki yachika par court mangalvaar ko sunwaayee kar sakati he
 What Harish Khurana said in the petition: BJP leader Harish Khurana has said in his petition in the court that Sunita Kejriwal, wife of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, has two voter cards
 unke paas ek sahibabad kaa, to doosraa dilli ke chandani chowk loksabhaa kshetra main aane vaale ilaake civil lines kaa voter card he
 And having more than one voter card is a crime under the Representation of People Act

 But despite her intentions, she has got more than one voter ID to make her husband and her party benefit
 unhone kaha he ki janpratinidhi act ke section 17 or 31 ke tahat ek se zyada voter idi card rakhana par uskaa galat istemaal dandaneey aparaadh he
 It is illegal to have more than one voter ID card under Section 417 of the Indian Penal Code
 isliye court sunita kejariwal ko saman karen or unase puuchhen ki aakhir unhone ek se adhik voter idi card kyon banawaye hue hai
 Apart from this, the court should also punish Sunita Kejriwal for having more than one voter ID card
 saath hi harish khurana ne sunita kejariwal ke paas upi or dilli ke alaava pashchim bengal kaa bhi voter idi hone kii baat kahi he
 He has said that Sunita Kejriwal's name is also appearing in the Election Commission website from West Bengal, but due to the election on Monday, he has not yet received confirmation from the Election Commission

 In his petition, Harish Khurana has also claimed that the information related to the three voter ID cards is publicly available and anyone can see this information on the Election Commission website
 harish khurana kaa kahana he ki arvind kejariwal adatan offender hai
 Before this, there has been a case against Kejriwal also having more than one voter card
 uske baavjood unki patni sunita kejariwal ke paas do voter card hai or wo dusron par aarope laga rahe hai

 Yet the name, which should have been included in the terrorists' list in the first attempt, had to be tried four times and hard bargained with China for nine years and eventually an unprecedented build up by US pressure and India's efforts at the UN This was possible with the diplomatic alliance
 bhaajapa ko ummid he ki suraksha parishad main mili is safalataa kaa phayda use loksabhaa chunaav ke bache charnon main milegaa
 However, amidst the success achieved by including Azhar in the list of terrorists, we should not turn away from the fact that it is now more difficult to deal with the increasingly aggressive China

 Chinese companies also have a strong presence in the white goods (TV, fridge etc
) sector and their boycott may lead to higher product prices
 jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay ke centre for iconomic studies and planning main professor biswajit dhar kehete hai, ‘‘durbhaagya se, menuphaccharing kshetra kii vyavasthit upeksha se hamane khud ko ek bakse main band kar liya he jisase hamane chini companiyon ko ek tarah se nyotaa de diya he ki ve aaen or is khaali jagah ko bhar den
 "since the beginning of the economic reforms in 1991, successive governments have talked big about the revival of the manufacturing sector, but without considering whether the Indian companies have the ability to face this import competition, we have the whole country Ka market opened to outside
 dhar kehete hai, ‘‘mujhe nahin lagata ki china par se nirbharta ko kam karne kii disha main ham jald koi safalataa hasil kar sakate hai
 Take drug manufacturing for example
 bharat dawa ke kachche maal (active pharma ingradients-epii) kaa 75 pratishat aayaat china se karata he
 India 2 from China in 2017-18
 5 arab dollar (17,250 karod ru
 ) Imported apis and other ingredients, while exports of finished drugs from India were just $ 200 million (rs 1,380 crore)
 ) kaa hua
 Uday Bhaskar, director-general of the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council (pharmaciesil), says, "because of the cheap labor, the cost of sugar product is reduced, which it benefits, the government is increasing exports by giving export incentives
" haalanki, ab vahaan bhi vetan main badhotaree hui he or pharma utpaadon kii keemten bad gai hai
 "in addition, according to the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) guidelines, the Chinese are upgrading their manufacturing facilities and even closing some of the pharmaceutical factories which were polluting the environment
 haalanki, inase china se hone vaale bharat ko niryaat par zyada prabhaav nahin padaa he
 Says Bhaskar, "indian companies continue to import products even at double prices
 ” 1990 ke dashak ke madhya main adhik laabhadaayak formulation (dawa ke nuskhe) par dhyaan kendrit karne ke baad bharat epii ke gharelu utpaadan ko badhaane se chook gaya or iskaa punaruddhar philhal jald hota najar nahin aata
 Smartphones make the most significant contribution to China's revenue among India's consumer goods
 bhartiya upabhokta chini smartphone ke saath vahaan ke saste phone par bhi khub kharch kar rahe hai
 Chinese smartphone brands such as Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and Huawei are among the top five phone vendors in India
 kuch smartphone, shiomi or vivo ko bharat main assembl kiya ja rahaa he or bhavishya main inkaa nirmaan bhartiya shramikon ke haathon bharat main kiye jane kii sambhaavna he
 Where do the options for India survive? Some experts say that the huge trade surplus that China takes advantage of, there seems some potential for India
 lekin bharat ke vyapaarik sambandhon kaa baarik vishleshan karen to yah saaf ho jaataa he ki vibhinn aapurti shrunkhalaaon main chini upkarnon kii is kadar paith ban chuki he ki iskaa tatkaal koi vikalp mil jaae, isaki sambhaavna nahin ke baraabar he
 In some cases, if some additional duties are levied on Chinese export companies, they will compensate the duty on Indian partners which will eventually be charged to Indian consumers as there is no reliable alternative to those products in any other country
 In our country only
 chini saamaan kaa bahishkaar karne se electronic saamaan jaise kai mahatvapurn utpaadon kii bazaaron main kami ho sakati he
 As a pressure strategy, this cannot work because India is a relatively small market for China
 2017 main china main bane saamaan kaa keval 3 pratishat niryaat hi bharat ke bazaaron main aayaa
 In addition, India was the sixth largest market for Chinese communication devices (including only 4 percent in 2017), including mobile phones
 dhar kehete hai, “beshak agar trump prashasan kii ore se shuru vyapaar yuddh main china ko itani tagdi maar pade ki use vaikalpik bazaaron kii talash kerani pade shaayad tab halaat badal sakate hai
 Then India will be in a big bargain with China
 ”purv videsh sachiv shyaam saran kehete hai, “bada aarthik saajhedaar hameshaa phaayde main rahata he
 The possibility of large trade and investment does not mean that we are in a position of great profit
 yadi samgr shakti sambandh kaa palada aapke paksh main nahin rahata, to aap rajnatik yaa ranneetik sambandhon ko badalane ke liye aarthik prabhaav kaa upyog karne kii sthiti main nahin hote
 Conversely, a more powerful country can use economic clout against you
 china ne australia, korea or yahaan tak ki japan ke saath bhi aisa kiya he
 China does not have independent small private companies, even large multinationals such as Alibaba and Huawei have deep ties to the Chinese government
 aarthik sambandhon ko rajnatik laabh ke saadhan ke rup main dekhne ke bajaae unhen apane gunon ke aadhaar par vistaar dena chahie
 "experts say this does not always happen
 lekin ve chetate hai ki dabadabaa bananaa itnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Long-term planning and strict decisions will be needed with the aim of reducing dependence on Chinese goods and changing the nature of trade relations
 iske liye ek vyapak adhyayan shuru karne kii bhi aavashyaktaa hogi
 It is also necessary to mention that no government has conducted any study till now to assess the penetration of Chinese companies in which sectors of the Indian economy and what could be the losses
 or sabase badi baat ki bharat ke liye apane se paanch guna badi arthvyavastha ko aarthik rup se vichlit karne kaa arth hoga ki ham china ke saath aarthik vishmata ko kam karne kii sthiti main khadey hon, kyonki bina iske anya sabhi vikalp, china ke ravaiye ko maamuli rup se hi prabhavit karne kii sthiti main honge
 Business options India is not the only country that finds itself in a dilemma in which, on the one hand, it is challenged to deal with political difficulties with China, while it is also economically constrained to maintain relations with China
 vaishvikrut duniya main ab yah sambhav nahin ki aap kisi se puri tarah katkar rah saken
 In this process, a situation of dependence will develop, especially on a country which is the second largest trading partner and largest exporter in the world
 vahiin aise desh jo loktantric or bazaar arthvyavastha vaale hai, unhen ek party kii satta vaale desh, jo apane rajnatik uddeshyon kii purti ke liye vyavsaayik shakti ke istemaal ke liye taiyaar rahete hai, se ek asmaan pratiyogita kaa saamana karnaa hi padataa he
 India's former ambassador to China Ashok Kanth exemplifies sino-japanese relations, where despite deep rivalry and historical enmity, the two countries have developed a huge mutual economic dependence
 japani praudyogiki or niveshon ne china kii arthvyavastha ko teji pradaan kii he jabaki kai japani companiyon ke liye china kaa bazaar sabase mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 He says, "if you consider the example of sino-japanese, the major reason behind the stability in the relationship between the two of them after 2015 is that both countries felt that they felt financially There is a great need for isane ek sthir kaarak ke rup main kaam kiya
 After the liberalization of relations in 1988, both India and China took the same approach
 yah isi aashaa ke saath hua tha ki ek-duusare kii jarurat banane se aapasi sangharsh kii sambhaavna kam ho jaaegi lekin mote taur par dekhen to china ke lihaaj se yah daanv kaam kar rahaa he, baavjood iske abhi china kaa bharat ke saath jitna aarthik sarokaar he, vah uske ghanishtha rup se jude purvi asian padosiyon ke mukaable kuch bhi nahin he
 However, he also draws attention to another aspect of this by giving examples of Japan and South Korea
 jab baat china kii adhinayakawadi sarkaar ke saath vyavhaar kii aati he, jahaan deshon ko dandit karne ke liye rajya kii sevaaon ke saath nijee kshetron ko bhi lamaband karke unka istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Japan and South Korea had also established a state of stability with economic relations, but China continues to violate it arbitrarily
 2012 main japan virdohi pradarshan jisko sarkaar kaa gupt samarthan bhi praapt tha, main bheed ko japani car shorumon main todphod karte dekha gaya or kuch japani auto companiyon ne kaarkaanon se asthaayee rup se apane karmchaariyon ko waapas bula liya
 Similarly after the deployment of the US had missile defense system in South Korea, China saw an outrageous public campaign aimed at targeting South Korean companies and stopping Chinese tourist groups visiting South Korea, trying to pressure Seoul
 Was done
 kaant kehete hai, “ye maamle darshaate hai ki china apni raajnneeti, arthvyavastha or samaaj kii prakruti ko dekhte hue in hatkandon kaa istemaal kar saktaa he
 These options are not available to us much
 ” bharat kii baat karen to yahaan kaa adhikansh dwipaksheeya vyapaar nijee kshetra ke jariye hota he
 Kant says, "we cannot dictate that buy such and such thing and stop buying such and such thing
 bharat sarkaar vyapaar ko protsaahan dene yaa hatotsahit karne ke kuch kadam uthaakar vyapaar ko prabhavit karne kii koshish bhar kar sakati he lekin ham companiyon ko aadesh nahin de sakate
 "combating China If we talk about the challenges facing India on the trade front, there are only a few selective measures that India can do
 bharat ke purv mukhya aarthik salaahkaar or foundation for iconomic growth and welfare ke adhyaksh arvind viramani kehete hai ki bharat ke saamne sarvshereshth vikalp kuch usee tarah ke non tarriff barier khadey karne ke hai jaisi baadhaaen “china aksar apane niryaat ko badhaane or isaki nitiyon kaa virodh karne vaale deshon ko dandit karne ke liye khadaa karata rahaa he
 Pointing to the software and telecom sector, he says, "the focus of the non-tariff barrier should be on areas that pose a potential long-term threat to India and all independent, open democratic societies
" is tarah kii niti kaa mukhya uddeshy chini communist party ke netritv ko yah sandesh dena hona chahie ki bharat apane vikaas ko rokane yaa dhimaa karne ke china ke prayaason ke aage jhukne vaala nahin
 "they say that for this India will also have to be ready to face troubles for a short time
" bharat china ko yah jataane ke liye ki vah tay kare ki use bharat ke vyapaarik sambandh jari rakhane hai yaa nahin, kuch chuninda upayon par bhi vichaar kar saktaa he
 "for example, we can tell Chinese companies that they have to choose whether they are interested in doing business in pok (some companies are working for the sino-pakistan Economic Corridor)," says Kant
 in the market
 unhen donon main se ek kaa chunaav karnaa hoga
 If we use this option instead of thinking of using trade surplus as a normal weapon, then it may be a more targeted and more effective approach
 ” dhar kehete hai, “hamen yah bhi samajhane kii aavashyaktaa he ki china ke khilaaf trump ne jo karrwai kii he uskaa asar america par bhi hua he
 a study conducted by a group of researchers from several major US universities concludes that in 2018 the GDP of the US is 7

 “that is, there is only one way left — to rapidly increase manufacturing capacity in critical areas

 "as always business looks for the cheapest option in the short term," says Virmani
 lekin agar chini doorsanchaar upkarnon par atyadhik nirbharta ghataane ke dirghakaalik laabh ko manyata di jaati he, to ise ghataane kii kifayati nitiyaan taiyaar kii ja sakati hai
 In fact, from changing the structure of trade relations with China to formulating appropriate policies to promote domestic manufacturing, India faces a major challenge on many fronts
 unki asafalataa companiyon ko shensen or guangjhau se apane saura panelon or doorsanchaar upkarnon ke aayaat ko protsaahit karegi
 Says Kanth, “this is an area where we need a long-term strategy
 yadi aap epii aayaat par vichaar karte hai, to is str kii nirbharta nishchit rup se vaanchhneeya nahin he or hamen aise desh ke saath is sthiti se baahar nikalne kii jarurat he jiskaa apane aarthik varchasv kaa istemaal dabaav banane ke liye karne kaa purana trek record he
 "another new area of concern, according to him, is also the technology sector where China has not only emerged as a major source of finance for Indian start-ups, but is now a major investor in Indian firms
 kuch reporton ke anusaar, tik tok se lekar yusi brouzar tak, bharatiyon ke 100 sabase lokapriy ap main se aadhe se thode kam chini nivesh se chal rahe hai
 If India chooses to take economic measures to pressure Beijing, it too has to be prepared for similar responses from China
 beijing epii or rear arth ke niryaat ko avaruddh karke bharat kii arthvyavastha ko pangu bana saktaa he
 China's attempt to break away from India, in particular, would be a violation of WTO rules, although China would follow the rules, there is no guarantee
 china ne ateet main bhi kai deshon par dabaav banane ke liye anaupchaarik rup se niryaat ko roak diya he
 The truth is that little has been done so far to reduce its significant dependence on China or to begin the process of evaluating that dependency and to find out which sensitive area needs an alternative
 adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki jab tak aisa nahin kiya jaataa, aarthik or vyapaarik upayon kaa istemaal dabaav banane ke saadhan ke rup main karne kii baat sochi bhi nahin ja sakati

 In view of the pollution caused by firecrackers on the occasion of Diwali, the Supreme Court has banned the sale of firecrackers till 1 November in delhi-ncr

 Bhagat further said that why only Hindus show courage to ban the festival? Will the sacrifice of goats and the bloodshed of Muharram soon stop? For those who want to improve the festivals like Diwali, i also want to see the same strong blood-filled festivals to improve them
 i want to see people who fight to remove crackers for Diwali show the same passion in reforming other festivals full of blood and gore
 - Chetan Bhagat (@chetan_bhagat) October 9, 2017 The Supreme Court has said that the sale of firecrackers will be able to resume from November 1, 2017

 He said that we still have to fight a long battle for Lokpal
 anna ne kaha ki teen din se maine khaanaa nahin khaaya phir bhi mujhe koi pareshaani nahin ho rahi he
 The doctor said that earlier my BP was fine but now it is messed up
 unhone kaha ki heart atake se log marate hai lekin agar desh ke liye meri maut ho gai ho yah meraa saubhaahgya hoga
 i do not fear death
 mujhe 25 saal ho gaye bhrashtachar se ladate
 Anna said that i did not go to my house in 35 years but now the whole country has become my family
 unhone kaha ki jis din maranaa he us din samaaj or desh ke liye maranaa he or jitna jeeta he unta desh ke bhale ke liye jeeta he
 Arvind and Kiran Bedi said that there was a difference in BP
 maidan main logon ko dekhakar meri urja badhati he
 i sat for 12 days in Ramlila Maidan
 itane din ke baad bhi kuch nahin hua uskaa kaaran he ki saamne jo janata thi uski urja mujhe mil rahi thim
 The government is cheating us, but this fraud team is not with Anna or Anna Hazare
 yah desh kii janata ke saath he
 If the government keeps doing this, then one day the people of the country will teach you a lesson
 sarkaar ko lagata he ki 5 rajyon kaa chunaav he lekin centre main to ham bane hue he
 We will campaign in 5 states
 sarkaar ko dikhaanaa he ki janata ki takat kya hoti he
 Delhi assembly is formed by the people of the country

 The public position is high
 agar kisi sarkaar ko kisaanon kii jameen leni he to vah kisi kii bhi anumati liye bana jameen chheen leti he
 The government has no right to acquire in this way
 gram sabha sabase badi he or agar centre or rajya sarkaar ko kisaanon kii jameen leni he to pehle gram sabha se anumati le
 For the land which is under the Gram Sabha, you decide by sitting in Delhi
 aapako kisi bhi gaanv kii jameen leni he to pehle gram sabha kii anumati leni he
 We still have to fight more battles
 anna ne kaha, 'aaj raajnneeti main jo log aa rahe hai vah gunde hai
 Today there are 150 goons in Sassand

 After Jan Lokpal, we have to enact the law of right to reject
 voter ko agar apane shretra main koi bhi ummidavaar pasand nahin he to usamen uske paas ek upaay hona chahie ki vah use naapsand karata he
 Laws of India are made here
 26 janvari 1950 ko jis din is desh main praja satta din manaaya gaya usee din se desh kii maalik praja ho gai
 The government vault belongs to him
 praja ne emele or empi ko apane sevak chunakar bheja
 We became owners but then fell asleep
 janata ko pataa hi nahin tha ki ham desh ke maalik hai
 10 years for Right to Information and benefited from that Kalmadi and A
 raja jaise log jail main gaye
 The awakening of Right to Information has come in the country
 sarkaar ko shashakt lokapal or rhite tu riject kanoon bananaa padegaa
 The Legislative Assembly and Lok Sabha are sacred temples of the country, but the goons are going in it
 hame kaam karnaa he ki is tarah ke log chunaav naa lard saken
 People with character have to be sent to Parliament
 aaj janalokapal kii ladaai ko 10 maheene ho gaye hai
 Earlier people were not aware of this
 lekin media ne iskon logon tak pahunchaaya
 We have to fight it as a second freedom fight
 aaj bhrashtachar ke kaaran saamaanya logon kaa jeena mushkil ho rahaa he
 He pays for every job
 aaj paariwarik logon ko apana parivaar chalaanaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 This time we will cross or cross, not move
 chaahe iske liye hamen jail main bhi janaa padaa ham peeche nahin hatenge
 The government's mind only runs when it is attacked
 meri desh ke logon se vinati he ki 30 disambar se 1 janvari tak ham jail bharenge
 The reason for the success we have today is that the youth of the country has awakened
 janalokapal kya he yah gaanv-gaanv tak chalaa gaya
 Youth power is nation power and if it is awakened then nothing is impossible
 vaiyatnam banaaya vah yuvakon ne bayana
 People like Azad and Bhakt Singh have made the country, we should not forget their martyrdom
 unhone kiske liye apni jaan di hamaare liye
 i have attached them to my life so i do not fear death
 yuvakon ko bhi yah baat samajni chahie
 Government will not make Lokpal law today
 abhi jo chunaav aane vaale hai uske baad raashtra chunaavon main puure desh main ghumenge or janata ko bachaayenge
 Treasures are not betrayed by thieves, but by cheaters
 is desh ko dushman se nahin in gaddaaron se dhokhaa he

 kathith ishaninda ko lekar ek pakistani chaatr kii peet-petakar hatya kiye jane se naaraaz malala usufji ne kaha ki islam or desh kii chhavi dhoomil karne ke liye pakistani khud jimmedaar hai

 darasal, un logon ko is chaatr par ishaninda karne vaali chijen internet par daalane or ahmadi sampradaay ko badhaava dene kaa shaq tha
 Malala, who was awarded the Nobel Prize and a 19-year-old girl education advocate in the UK, said in a video message, "today i got the news of Mashal Khan's death
 yah ghatana puri tarah se aatank or hinsa kii he
 i spoke to his father who gave a message of peace and patience
 main unke dhairya or shanti ke sandesh kii saraahna or salaam karti hum
 '' malala ne kaha, ‘‘hamen shikaayat he ki islamophobia he, duusare desh hamaare desh ko badnaam kar rahe hai
 Nobody is reducing Pakistan and Islam, we are tarnishing the image of Pakistan and Islam ourselves
 pakistan kii chhavi dhoomil karne ke liye ham khud hi jimmedaar hai
 '' Comments unhone kaha ki yah na sirf mashaal khan kii antyeshti he balki yah hamaare dharm kii bhi antyeshti he
 We have forgotten the teachings of Islam, which teaches us peace and patience
 unhone khan ko peet-peet kar maar daale jane kaa zikr karte hue kaha, ‘‘yadi ham ek duusare kii is tarah se jaan lete rahenge to koi bhi surakshit nahin bachegaa

 This incident is entirely of terror and violence
 maine uske pita se baat kii jinhone shanti or dhairya kaa sandesh diya
 i appreciate and salute his message of patience and peace
 ’’ Malala said, "we have a complaint that there is Islamophobia, other countries are maligning our country
" koi bhi pakistan or islam ko kamatar nahin kar rahaa, ham khud pakistan or islam kii chhavi dhoomil kar rahe hai
 We ourselves are responsible for tarnishing the image of Pakistan
 ’’ tippaniyan He said that this is not only the funeral of Mashal Khan but it is also the funeral of our religion

 Referring to Khan being beaten to death, he said, "if we continue to know each other in this way, no one will be safe
" ’’ Malala said, "therefore, my message to everyone is that you know your religion, culture, values, who have always taught us patience and preached peace

 The public is happy with the 100-day work of the Modi government at the Center and there will be a change in the system

 This will also happen in Haryana assembly elections

 Modi ji has changed the system of the center
 iskaa acha asar soobe main bhi dikhegaa
 As far as the results of the by-elections are concerned, we were not disappointed

 'BJP MP Ratan Lal Kataria said,' It is absolutely wrong to say that there is no BJP leader in Haryana
 kendriya netritv ko tay karnaa he ki kiske netritv main chunaav ladaa jaae
 After this, all the workers will follow the leader

 It is also true that there is an electoral strategy behind it
 kyonki haryana ke har pocket main bijepi majboot nahin he
 In such a situation, if the leaders of the public join us, what is wrong with it? ”on the question of the CM candidate of the party, Dharamvir Singh said,“ The legislature party will decide who is the leader
 netaa chunane ke baad kendriya haikaman ko iske bare main bataa diya jayega
 By the way, those who are currently running after declaring their CM candidate, they will not be able to form the government
 'is satr main choudhary virendra singh ne bhi hissaa liya
 He said that the Modi wave will work, but a bigger wave will be against the Congress

 The district administration in Agra has ordered the closure of the Anand Engineering College near the bird sanctuary for violating environmental laws
 ek adhikari ne guuruuvaar ko yah jaankaree di
 The official said that the District Magistrate juher-bin-sagir on Wednesday asked the wildlife department to seal the college adjacent to the Sur Sarovar Bird Sanctuary on the delhi-agra highway
 jila van adhikari sujoy banerjee ne kaha, 'dm ne elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ke aadesh par karrwai karte hue kalege ko band karaane kaa aadesh de diya he
 'it is noteworthy that the Wildlife Department had registered an FIR against this college six months ago and sealed it
 iske virodh main college prashasan ne ucch nyaayalay main apil kii, lekin pichley maheene hi adaalat ne use khaarij kar diya tha
 The birds of the sanctuary were greatly disturbed by the bright light of this college built on illegal land
 iske alaava college chatravaas kaa apshisht kachra bina kisi upachaar ke paas main hi bani jhil ko pradooshit kar rahaa he
 In the year 2012 also, the department sealed two of its buildings due to illegal construction and polluting the state's largest lake
 ye bhi mahatvapurn he ki isse pehle 2002 batch ke bhartiya van seva ke is afasar kii salanaa parformens report 14 saal tak outstnding rahi or 2016-17 main bhi unhen outstnding reating di gai he
 That is, only one year was given a poor rating in 2015-16
 dhyaan dene kii baat he ki isi saal chaturvedi ko raman magsese aword bhi mila
 Chaturved said in the court that this is a case of violation of his fundamental rights because his career is in danger due to APAR zero tax, ie he can be fired at any time
 chaturvedi ne ye bhi kaha ki 2015-16 main unhen koi kaam hi nahin diya gaya tha jiske khilaaf unhone tribunel main apil kii thi
 If there was no work, then the performance report was zero
 adaalat ne jab is bare main centre sarkaar kii ore se khadey edisnal solisitor general rakesh thapalial se sawaal kiya to unhone kaha ki chaturvedi ko hycourt main aane se pehle tribunel (sarkari afasaron kii praathmik adaalat) main guhaar karnaa chaiye
 On the demand of the government, the High Court also cited a decision of the Supreme Court stating that the petitioner should not come directly to the High Court
 chaturvedi ne iske khilaaf daleel dete hue kaha ki yahi adaalat (uttarakhand hycourt) is tarah ke saikadon maamalon main na keval sunwaayee kar chuki he balki faisle bhi die hai
 One case is of the state's Promotional Forest Service Officer Ashok Kumar Gupta
 is afasar ne apni padonnati ko rokane ke liye hycourt se guhaar lagaai taaki vah usee pad par rah chuke jis par pichley 6 saalon se he
 Chaturvedi told the court that ASG Rakesh Thapliyal - who is asking Chaturvedi to go to the tribunal before - had been a lawyer in Gupta's case but is now arguing the exact opposite in his case
 is tark ke baavjood adaalat ne chaturvedi se kaha ki vah pehle tribunel jaaen or agar vahaan unhen raahat nahin milti ko hycourt waapas aa sakate hai
 On Chaturvedi's plea, the court said, "the case of the petitioner cannot be considered that the court has interfered in such cases before
" is maamle main virdohi paksh (rapondent) ne turant aapatti kii he
 If any other writ petition has been heard in a flawed manner, then it does not benefit the petitioner that we should not follow the rules and regulations set by the Supreme Court
 ” The court has held in its judgment that the petitioner (sanjeev Chaturvedi) is right to say that there is only alternative remedy (option to go to tribunal) under Article 226 / 227, the court (high Court) is not deprived of the right to hear in this case
 Would do samvidhan ne adhikaar diye huye hai
 The High Court said in its judgment that if the fundamental rights are in danger then such courts can interfere, but referring to the judgment in the l Chandra Kumar case of the Supreme Court, it also said that these rules are not necessary in that case where The case falls under the Administrative Tribunal Act (as in Chaturvedi's case)
 apane faisle main adaalat ne supreme court ke 1997 main sunaae ek faisle ke aadhaar par kaha, “yachikakarta ko administrative tribunel act ke tahat tribunel janaa chahie
 We leave it to the petitioner to exercise all his rights there
 agar tribunel main unki yachika is aadhaar par khaarij ho jaye ki unka kanoonee adhikaar nahin he to ham yachikakarta ke is adaalat main waapas aane kaa rasta khulaa rakhte hai 
 "comments chaturvedi ke maamle main faisla dene ke baad bhi justise joseph kii bench ne hi kai duusari yachikaayen manzur kii he
 In one of these cases, a verdict has also been given in favor of the petitioner
 kanoon ke jaankaar ise hairaani vaali sthiti bataa rahe hai
 Supreme Court lawyer Sudarshan Goyal says, "such an order is shocking - disturbing
" yah adhik mahatvapurn isaliye ho jaataa he kyonki sarkaar ne chaturvedi ko lambey samay se pratadit kiya he or is maamle main sanjeev chaturvedi ne kendriya mantri je pi nadda ko aaropee banaaya he
 This bench has heard hundreds of such cases before and has given decisions in favor of the petitioner in many of them
 yahaan chaturvedi ko court galat nahin maan rahi phir bhi unhen raahat dene ke bajaay tribunel jane ko kahati he
 We have come to know that after a few days, the court is again not only accepting such cases for hearing but is also ruling on them in favor of the petitioner
 " When the court questioned Additional Solicitor General Rakesh Thapliyal standing on behalf of the Central Government, he said that Chaturvedi should approach the Tribunal (primary Court of Government Officers) before coming to the High Court
 sarkaar kii maang par hycourt ne bhi supreme court ke ek faisle ko uddhat kiya jisamen kaha gaya tha ki yachikakarta ko hycourt main sidhe nahin aana chaiye
 Chaturvedi argued against this saying that the same court (uttarakhand High Court) has not only heard in hundreds of such cases but has also given verdicts
 ek maamla rajya ke pramoti van seva afasar ashok kumaar gupta kaa he
 This officer requested the High Court to stop his promotion so that he had stayed in the same post which he has held for the last 6 years
 chaturvedi ne adaalat se kaha ki eesg rakesh thapalial - jo chaturvedi se pehle tribunel jane ko kah rahe hai – gupta ke maamle main vakil rah chuke hai lekin abhi unke cese main bilkul vipareet daleel de rahe hai
 Despite this argument, the court asked Chaturvedi to go to the tribunal first and return to the High Court if he does not get relief there
 chaturvedi kii daleel par court ne kaha, “yachikakarta kaa cese is baat par nahin mana ja saktaa ki court ne pehle is tarah ke maamalon main dakhal diya he
 In this case, the opposing party immediately objected
 kisi duusari rit pitishan par kisi trutipurna tareeke se sunwaayee hui he to isse yachikakarta ko ye phayda nahin mil jaataa ki ham supreme court kii ore se tay kiye gaye niyam kaayadon ko na maane
 " adaalat ne apane faisle main mana he ki yachikakarta (sanjeev chaturvedi) kaa ye kahana sahi he ki keval vaikalpik upaay (tribunel main jane kaa vikalp) hona anuchhed 226 / 227 ke tahat adaalat (hycourt) ko is maamle main sunwaayee ke adhikaar se vanchit nahin karata
 The constitution has given rights
 hycourt ne apane faisle main kaha ki agar moulik adhikaar khatre main hon to aise adaalat dakhal de sakati he lekin supreme court ke el chandra kumaar cese main die faisle kaa zikr karte huye ye bhi kaha ki ye niyam us cese main lagu hona zaruri nahin he jahaan maamla administrative tribunel act ke antargat aata ho (jaise chaturvedi ke cese main he) 
 In its judgment, the court said on the basis of a judgment of the Supreme Court in 1997, "the petitioner should go to the tribunal under the Administrative Tribunal Act
 ham ye yachikakarta par chhodte hai ki vah apane saare adhikaron kaa vahaan istemaal kare
 If their petition in the tribunal is rejected on the ground that they do not have legal rights, then we keep open the way for the petitioner to come back to this court
 ”tippaniyan Even after giving the verdict in Chaturvedi's case, the bench of Justice Joseph has accepted many other petitions
 isamen se ek maamle main to yachikarta ke paksh main faisla bhi sunaaya gaya he
 Law experts are calling this a surprising situation
 supreme court ke vakil sudarshan goyal kaa kahana he, “is tarah kaa aadesh hairaan - pareshaan karne vaala he
 This becomes more important because the government has tortured Chaturvedi for a long time and Sanjeev Chaturvedi has accused Union Minister JP Nadda in this case
 yahi bench pehle is tarah ke saikadon cese sun chuki he or unamem se kai main yachikakarta ke paksh main faisle bhi die hai
 Here Chaturvedi is not mistaken by the court yet asks him to go to the tribunal instead of giving relief

 kangana ranut ko bollywood kii queen yun hi nahin kaha jaataa
 This thing has been proved once again by the trailer of the film "judicial Hai Kya"
 trailor main kangana ranut or rajkumaar raav kii acting ke powerful panch dekhne ko mil rahe hai
 The film is releasing on July 26
 trailor ko dekhne ke baad soshal media par jabardast rispance mil rahaa he
 Viewers are still calling the film a super hit
 lekin ye film jitani apane content kii vajah se charchaa main he, utani hi ye myne rakhti he kangana ke liye bhi
 If we look at the career graph of Kangana Ranaut, she does not need any film that can handle her career
 kangana industry kii top most actraces kii list main pehle se hi shaamil hai
 In his career so far, he has given many superhit solo films
 kai yaadgaar kirdaar nibhaae hai
 But the film is Judicial is ready to take his career to a new level
 darasal, trailor main kangana ke kirdaar main kai veriation najar aa rahe hai
 Looking at Kangana's expression, Dialogue Delivery, it is not wrong to say that Kangana is going to leave soon the big stars from the industry
 film isi maheene 26 july ko relies ho rahi he
 Before the release, many controversies came up about the film, it was also said that Kangana had a mutual dispute with the makers
 film ke tital ko lekar bhi vivaad hua or aakhir main mental he kya, jajmental he kya ke saath saamne ai
 No matter how many controversies are associated with any film, the report of what matters most in the end
 jajmental he kya ek suspence thriller, murder mistry he
 The newness in the role of Kangana and Rajkumar is clearly visible in the film
 ye saare factor film ko box offis main shandaar entry dene ke liye kaaphi he
 If we talk only about Kangana Ranaut, then her acting shine has been seen in many films
 unamem fishan, queen, tun vaids manu, rangoon jaisi kai filmon main nibhaae gaye kirdaar shaamil hai
 But Bobby's role in Kangana's Judicial Hai Kya is different and tremendous
 kangana ne kai baar khule manch par bollywood ko chalange diya he
 The people of his speech are already convincing, but for the actor to speak on the screen of his talent is very important
 kangana ne ye kamyaabi bhi hasil kar lee he
 Even for a time, consider that Judicial is there, do not show the box office
 lekin ye tay he ki is film main kangana kaa kirdaar bobi lambey vakt tak yaad kiya jayega
 a woman, who has been missing for eight months, has returned to her home, but her husband is jailed for her murder
 anitha naamak is mahila kii 'maut se jindagi' kii kahani badi hi dilachasp he
 Let us know the story of death first
 bihar ke nalanda zile kii rahanevaali anitha pichley saal june maheene main apane pati rabindra ke saath kaam kii talash main gujarat gai
 She got separated from her husband at Ahmedabad station
 anitha na padhi-likhi thi, na hi use magahi ke alaava koi or bhashaa aati thi
 So she could not explain to anyone who she is and what happened to her
 laavaaris samajhakar sthaneey police ne use ahmedabad ke odhav nari sangrakshan grih main bhej diya
 On the other hand, the husband also returned to the village after Anita was not found
 anitha ke pita ne beti ko nahin dekha, to vah rabindra par aag babula ho gaye
 He lodged an FIR accusing Ravindra of killing Anita
 anitha ke na milane ke chalate police ne rabindra ko giraftaar kar jail bhej diya
 Anita also remained unaware of the news of her death at the women's conservation home in Ahmedabad
 pichley maheene nari sangrakshan grih kii zimmedaari rajya ke samaaj kalyaan vibhaag se lekar mahila or bal vikaas vibhaag ko saunp di gai
 This department showed promptness
 unhen laga ki is mahila ko ghar bheja ja saktaa he
 Negotiations started with Anita, who had been in the conservation home for six months
 vah apni baat vibhaag ko samaj nahin paa rahi thi
 Then the officials of the department felt that the language of this girl seems to be towards Bihar
 phir bihar kii bhashaa jaananevaale logon se usase poochtacha karwaai gayi
 It was then discovered that the girl's village name is Gopalbagh
 pehle laga ki baat bihar ke gopalganj jile kii he, lekin vahaan par jaanch se kuch hasil nahin hua
 After talking more, Anita said that the big city near her village is Nalanda
 isse yah saaf ho gaya ki jila nalanda hi he
 Knowing the name of the village from the internet there, it was found that it falls in the Sarmera police station of Nalanda
 sthaneey police se baatcheet shuru hui
 Police said that there is no such in this village
 phir pita kaa naam bataane par police pita ko lekar ai
 When the officials of the department spoke, they were shocked, because they were told that their daughter had died and they had also done her action
 thodaa jor dene par wo ladki se baat karne ko taiyaar hue
 When they talked, the girl told her name Anita, on which the father said that her daughter's name was not Anita
 phir anitha ne apane ghar kaa naam bataaya, tab jaakar kahin pita ko laga ki shaayad yah unki kii beti he
 The father and family came to Ahmedabad to meet Anita and upon seeing her, she was convinced that she was his daughter
 ab parivaar apni mritak beti ko zindaa lekar dobaaraa apane ghar pahunch gaye hai
 But husband Ravindra is still in jail, because only after the paperwork, the law will make Anita alive and Ravindra will be released from jail
 philhal is dilachasp kahani kii happy anding to ho chuki he

 koyala blokon ke aavanton ke liye isse paardarshee or niti nahin ho sakati thi kyonki 2004 main pratispardhi boli kii vyavastha hi nahin thi
 Criticizing the government for failing to timely implement the competitive bidding system for coal block allocation, the CAG stated in its report that if the process of allocation through bidding was implemented 1
 86 lakh karod rupee kaa kuch hissaa sarkaar ke khajaane main aa saktaa tha
 Jaiswal said his ministry did not agree with all aspects of the CAG report
 auditor ne jo akalan kiya he usamen koyala block aavanton ke kuch hi pahaluon ko aadhaar banaaya gaya he
 He said that we do not completely agree with the CAG calculation
 koyala mantri ne kaha ki nijee companiyon ko koyala blokon ke vikaas kaa kaam isliye diya gaya, kyonki saarvajanik kshetra kii company kol india desh kii badhati jarurat ko puraa nahin kar paa rahi thi
 He said that out of 57 coal blocks allotted to private companies, only one is extracting coal
 raakhi kaa tyohaar mek in india ke liye ek ahm model sabit ho saktaa he
 Where in the last year, on the festival of Rakhi in the country, crores of rakhi were manufactured from neighboring country China and sold in the market, Made in India dominated the rakhis in 2017
 iske chalate bazaar main raakhi kii maang sust rahi, kaarobaariyon kii cell aadhi rahi or munafa bhi ghat gaya
 Rakhi traders are also considering it as an impact of GST, but according to experts, the Rakhi business can prove to be a 'blessing in disguise' for Make in India
 2016 tak desh main lagbhag 15-20 karod rupee kaa raakhi kaarobaar tha
 In this, rakhi amounting to about 5 crores was imported to China and these imported rakhi of China increased the profit margin of rakhi traders
 lekin 1 july se desh main jiesti lagu hone ke baad raakhi manuphaccharing par 12 fisadi tex prastaavit kar diya gaya
 Also read: PM has been tying Rakhi to PM Modi on Rakshabandhan for 36 years, due to the effect of tension on the indo-china border before the festival, Rakhi traders did not place a big order for the rakhis made in China
 vahiin desh main anti chinis product campagne ke chalate bhi kharidaaron china kii nirmit raakhi se bachate dekhe gaye
 Due to both these reasons, along with the demand of Rakhi in the market, the days of cheap Rakhi are seen to end, there is also an increase in the price of Rakhis being sold
 jahaan beete saal tak china ke product kii maujuudagi ke chalate raakhi stall par sabase sasti raakhi 10 rupee kii thi, is saal stall par sabase sasti raakhi 20 rupee kii bechi gai
 At the same time, where the thread of the plain thread sold for 5 rupees last year, its price was kept at the stall this year at 10 rupees
 kaarobaariyon kaa daawa he ki jiesti or maid in india raakhi ke chalate unhen keemton main ijapha karnaa padaa
 Also read: Bengali sweets will reduce the sweetness of 'sandesh', according to 5% GST rakhi traders, the entire business is in the unorganized sector
 vahiin china ke product se raakhi treders kii jhatpat kamai khatm ho chuki he
 Therefore, next year, they are compelled to see their earning opportunity only in the ashes produced in the country
 jiesti ke daayre main aane ke baad raakhi kaarobaariyon ko manuphaccharing par 12 fisadi kaa tex adaa karnaa hoga
 But for them, there will be a huge demand in the market because the situation of the ashes coming from China may be in front of Make in India in the market
 gauratlab he ki desh main raakhi manuphaccharing ke liye varanasi, hyderabad, mumbai, dilli, kolkata, indore or jaipur ahm kendra hai
 Overall 50 to 60 types of ash are manufactured from these places, which cost from Rs 10 to Rs 1000
 raakhi banane main nirmaataaon ko silk or coton ke dhaagon ke saath-saath saste-mahange pathar, moti, chandan ityadi kii jarurat padati he
 At the same time, jewelers do a big business of high-end rakhis where gold and silver are also used along with expensive gems and jewelery
 beete dashak ke dauraan jis tarah china main nirmit products bhartiya tyohaar par apni pakad bana rahe the iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki is dauraan mahaj raakhi kaa ek-chauthai se adhik kaarobaar china main nirmit product ke kabje main tha
 Therefore, the business of manufactured rakhis in the country is expected to increase due to the decrease in Chinese products only in rakhi business
 iske alaava, anya tyohaar jaise holi, deepawali ityadi ko bhi china ke nirmit products se bachaa kar is kshetra main mek in india ko badha diya ja saktaa he

 hira kaarobaari neerav modi ke khilaaf 11,400 karod rupye ke bank ghotaalaa cese kaa bhi kanoon kii adaalat main vaisaa hi anjaam hoga jaisaa ki boforce or 2ji maamalon kaa hua
 That is, in this case also, the prosecution will have to face mouths
 ye kahana he neerav modi kii ore se bachaav paksh ke vakil vijay agarwal kaa
 In an exclusive interview with India Today, Aggarwal claimed that his client was not guilty in the alleged PNB scam
 agarwal telecom ghotaale main bhi kai hai profile sandigdhon kii ore se pairvi kar chuke hai
 Aggarwal said, 'all the allegations (against Nirav Modi) are false
 agar kisi ne koi frod kiya he to wo kyon 5600 karod rupye kii chal sampatti peeche chhod kar chalaa jayega jise pravartan nideshaalay (idi) ne kabje main liya he
 If the client (nirav Modi) had the intention of running away from fraud, he would have taken everything abroad, as Vijay Mallya did
 wo kyon 5600 karod ke heere or julri bharat main chhod jaataa, jise jabt karne kaa daawa khud pravartan nideshaalay ne kiya he
 'not seen with logic' Keswakil Vijay Aggarwal claimed that the PNB case against his client would not last anywhere during the trial
 agarwal ne kaha, ‘koi bhi ise taarkik dhang se nahin dekh rahaa
 This happened in the Bofors case
 yahi 2ji cese main hua
 The same happened in some cases related to coal
 yahi is cese main bhi hone ja rahaa he
 Nobody saw it with rationality
 unhone kaha, ‘ek hira kaarobaari ko kitni der lagati he apane sansadhano ko hiron main tabdeel karne or phir unhen baahar le jane main
 He would have stopped everything
 ’neerav modi is vakt kahaan hai, ye khulaasa karne se agarwal ne inkaar kiya
 According to Agarwal, he has spoken to his client over the phone
 haalanki saath hi agarwal ne muvakkil ke khilaaf bank frod main daakhil exiaar ko ‘adhuraa dastavej’ bataate hue koi tavajjo dene se inkaar kiya
 Vijay Aggarwal said, 'the charges have not yet been framed
 ye sirf exiaar he
 And the FIR does not always show the complete picture
 is vakt main nahin jaanata ki abhiyojan ke paas kya he
 According to him, when the Enforcement Directorate will file their complaint and the prosecution agency will file the charge sheet, then they will prepare themselves as defense
 kahana aasaan, sabit karnaa nahinjab neerav modi kii ore se fund hathiyaane ke sambandh main agarwal se sawaal kiya gaya to unhone phir 2ji licenson se sambandhit cese ke hashr kaa hawala diya
 Aggarwal said, 'it is very easy to say but to prove it in a court of law is a different thing
 2ji cese main hamane 200 karod rupe kii rishwat ke bare main suna tha
 Where is he? However, Agarwal also raised questions about the role of bank officials monitoring suspicious transactions
 agarwal ne kaha, ‘jo bhi he, ye sirf bank kii ore secredit ko badhaane kaa sawalhai bina atirikt security ke, jaise ki bank bahut se logon ke maamle main karte hai
 Coarse charges are collected from banks
 bank ke nideshak nahin jaanate ki kaise ye branch bank chargees ke jariye itnaa paisa bana rahi thi? agar massej bina kisi kii jaankaree ke bheje ja rahe the to bank un par bank charge kaise vasuul rahaa tha
 Vijay Agarwal said, "all bills that are discounted have a dark register number
" sab kuch bank kii kitabon main darj he
 The lawyer insisted that he had fought similar cases with success in the past
 isaki vajah abhiyojan ke paas pukhta sabooton kaa naa hona rahaa
 Aggarwal said, 'in the 2G case every media house had counted' facts' and you know what happened
 boforce cese main bhi unhone tamaam tarah ke ‘tathy’ die, kya hua
 We got bail in the railway scam within ten days
 ’ Regarding the allegations of Amarnath Mishra on Salman Nadvi, a member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj said that i do not find any truth in Amarnath Mishra's allegations
 unhone kaha ki jitani badi rakam, jitna bada aarope he, mujhe lagata he ki aarope salike se nahin lagaae gaye
 These allegations have no merit
 amarnath mishra ke aaropon main kuch sachai nahin lagati he, kyonki jis dhang se 5000 karod kii deal kii baat kii gai he, usamen koi aadhaar nahin lagata he
 'ram temple was there and it will be built there' On the construction of Ram temple, Sakshi Maharaj said that the grand divine temple of Ram was there, the temple will be built
 aarope-pratyarope va vaad-vivaad chalate rahenge
 Whether the matter is decided by the Supreme Court, whether it is by mutual harmony or by making laws
 lekin ayodhya main bhavy ram mandir banegaa
 'the foundation stone of the temple will be before 2019 elections', he said, adding that most Muslims have started thinking that if the court will ask for the temple, then the shehnai will ring and there will be mourning, so why not give it to us
 donon khush rahenge
 The Hindu will also be happy, the Muslim will also be happy
 unhone kaha ki 2018 ke ant tak nirmaan shuru ho janaa chahie, 2019 main chunaav se pehle mandir kaa shilanyas ke saath saath nirmaan shuru ho jayega, iske baad hi chunaav main jaaenge
 'ravi Shankar should answer' On Amarnath Mishra, Sakshi Maharaj said that whether or not Nadvi has refused, i do not know
 lekin 5000 karod rupee ke aarope par mujhe khud vishwaas nahin ho rahaa he
 i do not know Amarnath Mishra and do not even know on what basis he has made these allegations
 iskaa uttar shri shri ravishankar ko dena chahie
 'no power of the world can stop the temple', he said, if he is close to him, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar will give the right answer
 kyonki jo baat hui vah shri shri ravishankar nadvi ke bich main hui
 Mishra did not intervene
 mandir to banakar rahegaa
 No power of the world can stop the temple

 vanade international cricket main chauke-chhakkon kii barsaat ke bich ranon ke ambara dekhne kii aadat ham sabko lag chuki he
 But there will be some changes in the coming times
 pichley kuch samay se vanade cricket bas ballebaajon kaa khel banakar rah gaya tha aise main ye badlaav aane vaale samay main gendbaajon ke liye kisi jeevandaan se kam nahin hai
 The International Cricket Council has made three important changes in the rules of ODI cricket on Friday, as well as one rule of T20 International has been changed
 5 july se nae niyam lagu ho jaaenge
 Cricket is said to be a game of gentlemen and there should be a balance between the batsman and the bowler, but due to the rules of One Day International, the bowlers became very helpless
 vanade international main hue ye badlaav-1-isisi ne vanade international se batting powerple kaa funda hi khatm kar diya he
 Till now, the team batting between 15 and 40 overs could take powerplay
 paanch overon ke powerple main fielding paabandiyon ke chalate ballebaaj jamkar ran bator sakate the
 The bowlers will surely take a sigh of relief as the batting powerplay is over
 2-isisi ne shuruaati 10 over (anivaary powerple) main kaiching pojishan main anivaary fielderon ke rakhe jane ke niyam ko bhi hataane kaa faisla kar liya he
 After a change in this rule, the bowling team will be able to set the field accordingly
 field setelment ke liye gendbaaj or captain ke upar atirikt dabaav khatm ho jayega
 3-apart from this, another big change will be that outside the 30 yards circle, five fielders can be replaced instead of 4 in the last 10 overs
 ab aakhri ke overon main ballebaajon ke liye ran batorna pehle jitna aasaan nahin hoga
 In addition to the new rule of no ball in T20, one rule of T20 International has also been changed
 ab ballebaaj ko har tarah kii no ball par free hit milegi
 Earlier, the batsmen used to get free hits only on the no ball that was outside the crease of the bowlers
 tii-20 main yah niyam ballebaajon ke liye ek nai khushkhabari lekar aayaa he
 These changes were necessary for the bowlers in the day cricket
 tii-20 formet aane ke baad se hi cricket main bahut badlaav aayaa he
 Cricket was completely becoming a batsman's game
 300 se upar kaa score bahut aam baat ho chuki thi or 400 se zyada kaa score bhi ab surakshit nahin rah gaya tha
 The new rules will come into effect from July 5 and it has to be seen how much it helps bowlers
 puri tarah se ballebaajon kaa khel banate ja rahe vanade international match main ek baar phir gendbaajon ke liye nai sambhaavnaaen najar aaengi
