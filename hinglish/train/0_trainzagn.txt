 Along with this, there will be rapid development of other departments related to the area

 However, they can use this coal only for their personal work
 vah ise bazaar main nahin bech sakate
 After this decision of the Union Cabinet, coal mines can be easily sold to domestic and foreign mining companies through e-auction

 There is a tradition of worshiping Lakshmi in the country on Deepawali, but West Bengal and Bengali community worship mother Kali on this day
 deepawali ke din yani amavasya kii ardharatri main kii jaati he
 Why there is worship of Kali Maa: Mother Durga comes on a new moon day
 jise ham sharadiya navaratri ke taur par jaanate hai
 After 15 days, the practice of worshiping mother Kali in the second Amavasya has been in Bengal
 alag se hoti he lakshmi kii puja:dashami ke 6 din baad bengal melakshmi kii puujahoti he
 However, just as Ganesha is worshiped along with Lakshmi in North India and the rest of the country, Lakshmi is not worshiped
 bengal main lakshmi puja ke din sirf maa lakshmi kii pratimaa sthapit kii jaati he
 How the worship of Kali Maa is done: There is a tradition of offering 108 Gudhal flowers, 108 Belpatras and Malas, 108 earthen lamps and 108 Durvas especially to the mother in worship
 saath hi mausami fal, mithai, khichdi, kheer, tali hui sabji tathaa anya vyanjanon kaa bhi bhoga mata ko chadhaaya jaataa he
 This method of worship, which lasts till 4 o'clock in the morning, involves home-havan and wreaths
 is maukey par adhikansh mahila va purush subah se upwas rakhkar raatri main mata ko pushpanjali arpit karte hai
 Importance of worshiping Kali: Mother Kali is the main goddess of the Shakti community, it is in the total ten forms of Mahavidya
 shakti kaa mahanatam swarup mahavidhyaon kaa hota he
 Fear is overcome by worshiping Kali
 inaki archana se rog mukt hote hai
 Mother Kali's worship for the peace of Rahu and Ketu is unmatchable
 maa apane bhakton kii raksha karke unke shatruon kaa naash karti hai
 The effect of tantra-mantra is eliminated by worshiping them
 kaali kii puja ke niyam:do tareeke se maa kaali kii puja kii jaati he, ek saamaanya or duusari tantra puja
 General worship can be performed by anyone, but Tantra worship cannot be done without the Guru's protection and instructions
 kaali kii upasna sahi samay madhya raatri kaa hota he
 Red and black objects have special significance in their worship
 maa kaali ke mantra jaap se zyada inkaa dhyaan karnaa upyukt hota he
 Worship Kali to get rid of enemies: Mother Kali should be worshiped to pacify the enemy and the adversary, not to death anyone
 aap virdohi yaa kisi shatru se pareshaan hai to us samasya se bachane ke yah upaay hai
 If your enemies bother you, you should wear red clothes and sit on a red seat and light a lamp and googling in front of Mother Kali
 maa ko prasad main pede or laung chadhayen
 After this, by chanting 11 garlands of 'un Krik Kalikayai Namah', pray for freedom from enemies and lawsuits
 mantra jaap ke baad 15 minute tak pani nahin chhuen
 Do this archana continuously for 27 nights
 aisi manyata he ki in upayon ko karke aap maa kaali kaa aashirwad praapt kar sakate hai

 The Opposition was attacking the Goa government, calling the visit of these mlas a wasteful expenditure

 The Goa government said that this decision was taken while bowing to public sentiments
 khel mantri ramesh tavadakar ne kaha, 'sarkaar ne aadesh waapas le liya he
 We have made this decision by bowing to public sentiments
 ' mantri kii ghoshnaa se kuch hi ghante pehle vidhayakon ne saarvajanik taur par kaha tha ki ve apane daure kaa kharch khud vahan karne ko taiyaar hai
 However, five members of the group have been allowed to travel to Brazil at their personal expense and the government will not bear their expenses
 khud hi chah vidhayakon kii suchi se apana naam waapas lene vaale tavadakar ne kaha, 'hamen is vajah se brazil ke daure par janaa tha, kyonki goa rashtriya khelon kii mejabani karegaa or usne under-17 footbal vishwacap kii mejabani kaa daawa bhi pesh kiya he

 ' khel mantri ne kaha ki pratinidhimandal ke daure ke mudde ko pichley do dinon se badha-chadhaakar pesh kiye jane ke kaaran mantralay ko daura radd karne par majaboor hona padaa he
 The opposition Congress, which did not trust the announcement by the mlas to bear the expenses of the tour itself, insisted that the government write notes on the file that the tour had been canceled
 congress kii goa ikai ke pravaktaa durgadas kaamat ne kaha, 'ham chaahate hai ki file noting saarvajanik kii jaae
 Till then we will not be satisfied, because Manohar Parrikar has a habit of taking a U-turn
 kaamat ne kaha ki brazil daure kaa mudda tool pakadaney ke kaaran sarkaar nuksaan kii bharpai kii sthiti main aa gai he
 He said, 'this is actually an exercise to make up for the loss, because Prime Minister Narendra Modi is coming to Goa
 'kaamat ne aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar ne bhale hi daura radd kar diya ho, lekin paanchon vidhayakon kaa kharch ab corporate gharaane vahan karenge
 However, the Sports Minister dismissed the allegation saying that a corporate house was sponsoring the tour

 Significantly, the former UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has also raised questions about the disturbances in the voting machine in Madhya Pradesh

 Also, he wrote that only E

 Earlier, the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) raised the disturbances in the voting machines (evms) in Madhya Pradesh before the Election Commission and demanded that the use of evms should be stopped in the forthcoming elections and the system of conducting elections through ballot should be restored

 The team management has imposed a fine of 300 Australian dollars (on each) on the 8 cricketers of the Pakistani cricket team who arrived in Australia to play the World Cup
 in 8 cricketron main shahid afridi, umr akmal or ahamed shahzad jaise diggaj cricketer bhi shumaar hai
 The Pakistani team is currently preparing for the World Cup in Sydney
 beete ravivaar ko 8 pakistani cricketer apane doston ke saath dinar par gaye
 He was delayed by 45 minutes
 is par purv military main or team manager naved cheema ne in aathon cricketron par jurmaana laga diya
 These eight cricketers were fined 300 Australian dollars (about 14300 rupees)
 itnaa hi nahin cheema ne sabhi cricketron ko chetaya ki agar phir se aisa kuch hua to unhen waapas pakistan bhej diya jayega
 Pakistan is scheduled to play the first match in the World Cup against India on 15 February
 yah match edilade main khelaa jayega
 Pakistan has never been able to win against Team India in the World Cup till date
 jammu kashmir main niyantran rekha parasurang kaa pataa chalane parabhartiya sena ne pakistan se isaki shikaayat kii he
 Jammu region IG BSF Rakesh Sharma said that he has also talked to the Pakistani Rangers in this regard and will also give evidence to them
 unhone yah ashanka bhi jataai ki pakistan kii ore se surang ke jariye bade aatanki hamale kii sajeesh rachi ja rahi thi
 He said, 'we came to know of the tunnel on Thursday
 hamanepakistani rangersko isaki soochna di he or unhen aage aakar saboot dekhne ke liye bhi kaha he
 The tunnel is quite large and such activities could pose a major threat in the future
 ''pakistan ne diya sahyog kaa bharosa'aiji biguef ne kaha ki jaisi surang mili he usase pakistan kii ore se bhavishya main barighuspaithho sakati he
 We have also complained to Pakistan that everything was in their knowledge
 pakistan ne is maamle main sahyog kaa vaada kiya he
 He said, "we will further strengthen the security arrangements so that any such action can be prevented in future
" ' What did the Congress say in its manifesto that the BJP feels that it has a job to break the country
 ghoshnaa patr ke pehle din arun jetali ne jab sawaal kiya to unka focus inhen baton par tha
 This is what the BJP has emphasized in its campaign
 4 april ko raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne inhen baton par press conference kii
 Let us first see what the Congress has said on the question of security
 pej number 41 par congress ne jammu kashmir ko lekar kaha he ki bharat ke anuchhed 370 ko shaamil gaya gaya he
 There will be neither permission nor any attempt to change this constitutional position
 zarur shuruyaat se bijepi or aresas kaa yah agenda rahaa he ki anuchhed 370 badal denge
 Do you remember that even after the Vajpayee government and the Modi government, after serving their full term, any concrete initiative has been taken to remove it
 jammu kashmir main sashastr bal adhinium or ashaant kshetra adhinium kii samiksha kii jaayegi
 Appropriate changes will be made to the legal provisions to balance security needs and protection of human rights
 sashastr balon kii tainaati kii samiksha karne, ghuspaith rokane ke liye seemaa par adhik sainikon ko tainaat karne, kashmir ghati main sena or siarpief kii maujuudagi ko kam karne or kanoon vyavastha banaae rakhane ke liye jammu kashmir police bal ko or adhik zimmedaari saunpane kaa vaada karti he
 The Congress has said that it will review the AFSPA Act in Jammu and Kashmir
 suraksha kii zaruuraton or maanavadhikaar ke sangrakshan main santulan ke liye kanoon main badlaav karegi
 Congress has not talked about removal, then why does BJP think that Congress has talked about breaking the country? Retired Lieutenant General DS Hooda, who led the surgical strike in September 2016, has recently prepared a document on security for Congress
 ji es hooda ke hi suzav congress ke ghoshnaa patr kaa hissaa bane hai
 Can Lieutenant General Sahab, who performs surgical strikes, suggest such a thing that would break the country? Why do Defense Ministers Nirmala Sitharaman and Arun Jaitley think that the Congress review will boost the morale of terrorists
 nirmala sitaraman ne jaise hi apane hi baat ko aaj twit kiya, pidipi netaa mahabuuba mufti ne usee twit par ri-twit kar diya ki pidipi ne jo gathbandhan ke liye agenda banaaya tha, jis par bijepi ke saath gathbandhan hua, usamen jammu kashmir se afaspa hataane kii baat kahi gai thi
 If its removal is anti-national and the morale of the army declines, then why did BJP move from three places in Arunachal? When BJP wanted power, it was okay to remove AFSPA, but it was treason when Congress said? Omar Abdullah also tweeted a news report in 2014 about bjp's approval to remove AFSPA
 1 disambar 2014 ke live mint main jammu kashmir bijepi ke netaa ramesh aroda kaa bayaan chapa he ki vaadi main aisa maahaul banaaenge ki bina kisi dar ke or shantipurvak tareeke se sab kaam honge or aise sakht niyam kii zarurat hi nahin hogi, lekin 18 march 2017 ko ram madhav kaa bayaan tha ki yah koi mazaaq main lagaaya gaya kanoon nahin he ki ise hataa diya jaae
 Mehbooba Mufti was talking about the removal at that time
 wo dekhnaa chaahati thim ki dekha jaae ki hataane se kya asar padataa he
 AFSPA has been removed from the northeast during the Modi government
 2015 main tripura se hataaya gaya
 Also removed from Meghalaya in 2018
 arunachal pradesh main bhi ise simit kiya gaya he
 But it was never removed in Jammu and Kashmir
 yahaan baat jammu kashmir ko lekar ho rahi he
 Passed in 1958 to the states of the Northeast
 1990 main jammu kashmir main lagu hua
 This gives the military and armed forces exclusive rights in the troubled region
 is praavdhaan se las sena bina warrant ke search kar sakati he, giraftaar kar sakati he, firing kar sakati he
 You will remember that Irom Sharmila fasted for sixteen years to get this law removed from Manipur
 congress ne nirmala sitaraman ke aaropon kaa jawaab diya he
 Sushil Mahapatra has spoken to former Air Vice Marshal Kapil Kak on this question
 kapil kaak kashmir ke hai or vaartakar bhi hai
 Kapil Kak has referred to the Jeevan Reddy Commission
 2004 main manipur kii thangajam manorama kaa shav mila tha
 He is picked up at night and found dead the next day
 goliyon se chalni
 The Assam Rifles were accused
 isi ke khilaaf 15 july 2004 ko imphal main 14 maaon ne kangla fort ke baahar ne nirvastr hokar pradarshan kiya tha
 After this, Justice Jeevan Reddy Committee, a former judge of the Supreme Court, was formed
 is cameti ne suzav diya tha ki afaspa ko samaapt kar dena chahie
 The law has become a symbol of hatred and discrimination, but BP Jeevan Reddy's committee was made in the context of the North East, so how can it be anti-national if a former judge, former lieutenant general of the army, talks about removing or reviewing AFSPA Gone? How was it going to break the country? a judgment was delivered by the Supreme Court on 14 November 2018
 maamla yah tha ki supreme court main ek janhit yachika daayar kii gai ki manipur main 1980 se 2011 ke bich sena, ardhsainik balon, manipur police ne 1528 logon kii extra jeudicial hatya kii he
 It should be investigated
 supreme court ne sibiai jaanch ke aadesh kar die
 When 700 former army officers went to court against this decision that it should not happen
 sibiai jaanch nahin kar sakati or na hi exiaar ho sakati to he supreme court ne unki yachika ko riject kar diya tha
 This petition was also supported by the Central Government
 supreme court ke justise madan bi lokur or justise yuyuu lalit ne jo kaha tha ki unhen sena ke manobal ko lekar raajnneeti karne waalon ko yaad rakhana chahie
 Both honorable judges had said that it is not right to raise the ghost of the morale of the army, paramilitary forces and state police
 kya supreme court ke is faisle se desh tut gaya
 This is what the Supreme Court said that it is not right to bring the morale of falling morale repeatedly
 zaahir he manobal itani aasaani se nahin girtaa he
 The case of Jammu and Kashmir is complicated
 aise kai log jo is maamle ko lekar kisi bhi bayaan ko lekar daud padate hai wo internet par ek khabar tak search nahin karte hai
 But they definitely keep an opinion on Kashmir
 bataaiye kya ye deshadroh nahin he
 whatsapp message comes
 whatsap uniwarsity main kashmir kaa course kar rahe khalihar logon yani phaltu logon ko meri ek raay he
 Definitely keep an opinion on Kashmir dispute but read a little
 padhane se hi pataa chalegaa ki supreme court ne kaha ki manobal kaa bhoot mat nachaao
 The Supreme Court has ordered a CBI inquiry
 aapako yaad hoga jammu kashmir main pathar baazon kaa maamla channelon par khub chalaa
 That was the problem, but what happened later
 aapako yaad dilaate hai
 You search the Internet on India Today, Outlook, Times of India, Hindu, Scroll and Wire
 taarikh he 3 farvari 2018
 It is in this news that the Ministry of Home Affairs has withdrawn cases against a total of 9,730 people
 1,745 ke khilaaf kuch sharton ke saath cese waapas liye gaye hai
 This information was given by Mehbooba Mufti in a written reply in the Assembly
 usee ko akhabaaron ne chapa he
 When all the cases were withdrawn, you saw day and night commotion on the same channels
 sarkaar ko lalkaar dekhi thi
 Then the BJP government was in Jammu and Kashmir along with Mehbooba
 hindustan times main 7 june 2018 ko grahamantri rajnath singh ne kaha tha ki sarkaar ne isliye mukademe waapas liye hai, kyonki yuvaaon ko bargalaaya ja saktaa he
 They make mistakes
 khabar main likhaa he ki rajnath singh ne shere kashmir indor stadium main chah hazaar yuvaaon ke saamne yah baat kahi thi
 This talk of the Home Minister is like a Home Minister
 uttar bharat ke whatsap uniwarsity or news channel dekhne waalon se puuchhie to kahenge ki patharbaz aatankwaadi he
 News channels did a lot of provocative programs about the stones, which used to be talked through
 magar jaisaa ki rajnath singh ko aapane suna wo pattarbazon ke saath aar-paar kii baat nahin kar rahe the
 Giving them a chance
 baatcheet kaa rasta khol rahe the
 Now any uneducated knowledgeable anchor could declare that the Home Minister dropped the morale of the army, because the stone had gone against the army but the case was withdrawn from 10,000 stone pelters
 kisi ne nahin kaha ki manobal gir gaya
 Till date, Home Minister Rajnath Singh had said in the news channel's program Panchayat that i am not ready to believe that stone pelters are terrorists
 utyub par aap yah intervyuu sun sakate hai
 Read a lot on Kashmir
 acchhee baat he ki aap ise lekar raay rakhana chaahate hai magar pleez news channel dekhakar or hindi akhbaar padhakar kashmir par koi raay na banaaen
 It is better to walk in the evening and chew sugar cane, it will clean the teeth and also be strong
 sena ke manobal ko lekar chintaa na karen
 The morale of the army must have fallen from this too, if it falls then when Yogi Adityanath calls India's army as Modi's army
 vaise yakeen rakhie bharat kii sena kaa manobal kam se kam bharat ke girte raajnneetik str se kabhi nahin girtaa he
 Absolutely no military morale falls due to poor speech by the leaders
 manobal vah bal nahin he jo bolne se gir jaataa he
 This is my theory, but does not give me any Nobel Prize
 congress ne apane ghoshnaa patr ke pej number-35 par likhaa he kibhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 124 e (jo ki deshadroh ke aparaadh ko paribhaashit karti he) jiskaa durupyog hua, baad main nae kanoon jane se uski mahatta bhi samaapt ho gai he, use khatm kiya jayega
 Many students of whatsapp University today asked the question whether the Congress is promoting treason, abolishing the law? Books have been written to abolish this law
 gautam bhaatia kii angrezi main likhi kitaab he offend, shock or disturb
 750 and printed from Oxford University Press
 isamen cedishan yani deshadroh ke is kanoon ko lekar acchhee jaankaree he
 Read it
 is kanoon kaa istemaal hameshaa abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ko kuchalane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 In 1870, the British were brought in to provoke dissent against the British rule or to crush those who worked against the government by committing treason
 iskaa istemaal us samay ke swatantraaa senaanee, patrkaar, vakeelon ke khilaaf kiya gaya
 You will remember the case of the great freedom fighter Bal Gangadhar Tilak
 1897 main trial chalaa tha
 Treason was also prosecuted for Gandhiji
 gautam bhaatia ne apni kitaab main is kanoon ko lekar samvidhan sabha main hui bahes, azaad bharat main hoicourt ke alag-alag faislon or supreme court ke alag faislon kaa zikr kiya he
 In 1995, the case of Balwant Singh vs
 Government of Punjab is given
 indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad kuch yuvakon par deshadroh kaa aarope laga ki ve khalistaan zindaabad ke naare laga rahe the
 The court acquitted on the ground that the speech did not matter
 naare lagane ke nachije main koi hinsa nahin hui
 Law and order did not deteriorate
 1860 main angrezon ne bhartiya dand samhita banaai
 There was no case of treason in this
 yah praavdhaan tab aayaa jab devband ke ulimaon ne angrezon ke kilaaf fatwa de diya ki azaadi kii ladaai islamic farz he tab use kuchalane ke liye deshadroh kaa kanoon laayaa gaya
 This law came to crush the spirit of patriotism
 iske jane se deshbhakti kii bhaavana ko kaise thes pahunch sakati he
 If you spend time in whatsapp University, all this will not be known
 deshadroh kaa yah praavdhaan abhivyakti kii swatantraaa or raajnneetik virodh ke adhikaar ko kuchalane main kiya jane laga he
 Treason was charged against Aseem Trivedi for making cartoons
 tab upie kii sarkaar thi
 Treason charges were leveled against 27 people protesting against the nuclear plant in Tamil Nadu under the UPA government
 haal hi main aligarh muslim uniwarsity ke chaatro kaa republic tivi ke patrkaar se vivaad ho gaya to police ne 14 chaatro ke khilaaf deshadroh kaa aarope laga diya
 The complaint was made by the district president of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha that some students were raising slogans of Pakistan
 magar esaspi ne ek hafte baad yah bataaya ki 19 farvari ko saare cese waapas le liye gaye, kyonki chaatro ke khilaaf koi saboot nahin mila
 It is better that the Congress is learning from its past mistakes
 use thik kah rahi he
 The Congress has said one more thing in its manifesto which is neither discussed nor disputed
 kaha he ki bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 499 main sanshodhan karenge or manahani ko divaani aparaadh banaaenge
 No one will be jailed for defamation
 to aapako jail or bel se chhutkaaraa mil jayega
 If you win then you will get compensation
 meri raay main isamen muaavze kii bhi raashi tay honi chahie
 According to the constitution, we are all equal, so we all should have the same value
 sava rupee kii manahani se zyada kisi kii manahani nahin honi chahie
 If we comment on a corporate, then we will file a defamation case
 kai hazaar karod kaa
 It will not be okay
 corporate cese zarur kare or jeet jaae to sava rupee kii manahani le le
 Will give hand to hand
 check kii jagah chavanni pakadaa kar baahar aa jaaenge
 The idea is not overwhelming
 vaise 2011 se hi charanni band ho gai he
 Let's defame two rupees
 lalu kii bahu kaa aarope, ghar main nahin miltaa khanaabahu aishwarya ne kaha, maayke se mangavaana padataa he khanarashtriya janata dal (rajd) ke adhyaksh lalu prasad ke bade putr or bihar ke purv swasthya mantri tejpratap yadav kii patni aishwarya raay ne rabari devi or misa bharti par pratadna kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Rabri Devi is the former Chief Minister of Bihar and mother-in-law of Aishwarya
 vahiin misa unki nanad hai
 Aishwarya said, don't even give me food
 unhone kaha, 'kichan main jane ko bhi nahin miltaa isliye unka khaanaa unke maayke se aayaa he or us khaane ko bhi unhen khud hi lenaa hota he
 No one else in the house brings that food from outside to inside
 'aishwarya ne kaha- lalu hote to sab thik kar deteunhone lalu yadav par bharosa jataate hue kaha ki agar mere sasur yahaan hote to wo chizon ko thik kar dete, lekin wo yahaan nahin hai
 She was referring to Lalu Yadav, who is currently serving a sentence in the fodder scam case and is admitted to RIMS Hospital due to ill health
 tej pratap yadav or unki patni aishwarya raay ke bich lambey samay se anban chal rahi he or donon ne talaak ke liye yachika daayar kii he
 Recently Aishwarya left Lalu Niwas
 vah rote hue ghar se baahar nikali thim
 Aishwarya, who came out of the house crying 15 days ago, actually went viral on September 13, a video of Aishwarya walking out of her in-laws' house
 is video main aishwarya apni saas or purv mukhyamantri rabari devi ke awaas se paidal baahar nikalate dikhi thim or unka cheharaa tamtamaaya hua tha
 He was also seen tearing his eyes in the video
 video ke mutabik wo rabari ke awaas se nikalne ke baad baahar (sadak par) khadi apane pita kii gaadi main baith gayi
 In this video too, Aishwarya was clearly seen upset
 court main talaak kii arji de chuke tejpratapullekhneey he ki tejpratap yadav se talaak prakaran ke baad saamne aa raheen baton se yah kaha ja saktaa he ki lalu ke ghar main sab kuch thik nahin he
 However, no RJD leader is willing to speak anything in this regard
 bataa den ki shaadi ke kuch dinon baad se hi tejpratap or aishwarya ke bich rishte kharaab hone lage the
 Later, Tej Pratap filed a divorce application in the court
 is maamle kii sunwaayee abhi patna kii ek adaalat main chal rahi he

 In northern Maharashtra, onion was stolen from a farmer recently and when he approached the police to file a report, he was allegedly told to go to an astrologer to trace the thieves
 dhule jile ke lonikhede gaanv ke kisaan sunil patil ne kaha, 'main us samay bhaunchak rah gaya, jab police ne pyaaj cheri karne waalon kaa pataa lagane ke liye kis jyotishi se sampark karne ko kaha

 dilli metro main in dinon yatriyon ko khule paison ko lekar mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he

 Due to this, he has to pay 20 rupees a day

 Dayal said concrete action can be taken on receiving a written complaint in this regard

 Assembly elections are going on in Bihar and i got a chance to go here once again in the midst of this enthusiasm
 pichley saal loksabhaa chunaavon main punjab kii bajaay bihar ko chunaa tha
 There was an euphoria to understand the state which was said to be backward in many parameters
 wo chhavi pichley saal aisi badali ki is saal jane main samay nahin ganvaaya
 Last year, the roads and toilets of Bihar did not allow any problem in the journey
 hansiega nahin, lekin jab din main 400-500 kilometre safar sadak ke jariye karnaa ho to ye donon chijen bahut myne rakhti hai
 So this time i chose the issues for the assembly elections
 jane se pehle studio main ek din bihar se varisht patrkaar ne bataaya ki unki shaadi ke samay gaanv main bijli ke liye pole lag gaya tha, sasuraji ne bade garv se kaha tha jamibabu 6 maheene main bijli aa jaaegi
 38 years have passed, till date there is no electricity
 bas isi baat se ichha bad gai ki kyon na jayja liya jaae
 There are many villages in Bihar where there is no electricity, and why Bihar itself has many
 to kyon na isi se shuruyaat ho
 We reached Gopalganj before reaching Patna
 vaishali, siwan hote hue mirganj ke raste pahunche gopalganj ke ek gaanv
 i was surprised how people were running their work here with solar energy
 sabake paas phone tha, ghar saaf suthere the, logon main badlaav ke liye aawaaj thi
 One said in a loud voice that despite being an OBC, they are helpless
 shaam hote hi andhera har ore chaa gaya, lekin jate-jate acha laga ki bachche laalaten kii roshni main man laga kar pard rahe the, angreji bol rahe the, saaf lahaze main
 The mind was relaxed, even if our leaders do not give us the basic facilities in the 21st century, the country will move forward
 ye wo rajya tha jahaan se padhai puri karke mere kai sahyogi aate hai
 Why is there so much migration from this state, why did people feel so insecure
 15 saal ke lalu raaj ko to sab koste hai, lekin usase pehle 10 saal tak congress ne 6 mukhyamantri badale, jisase raajnneetik asthirataa rahi
 The comments nitish-bijepi ke 10 saal main halaat badale
 The ransom business was curbed, but it took time for the system and organizations to get back on track
 desh ke saath yahaan kaa yuva aage bad gaya
 Be it educational institutions or employment opportunities in Delhi, people did not stop migrating
 anpadh majdoor bhi kamai ke liye baahar nikal gaye
 As soon as they come out of Patna in Bihar, there are tall fields, greenery is seen all around, people are less visible, although the population density is the highest in the country in terms of population
 yah rajya vikaas ke liye betaab sa he, zarurat he sahi niyat kii

 Has been made

 This will benefit 50 crore people living in these families
 mayawati ne kii centre sarkaar kii aalochana, kaha aam bajet ke daawey hawa-hawaibad main sarkaar se jude sutron ne bataaya ki iske liye har parivaar par sarkaar ko kareeb 1100 rupee premium dena hoga, jisase anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa he ki sarkaar ko kareeb 11 hajaar karod rupee prativarsh iske liye chahie honge
 Despite this, Jaitley has not made any major allocation in the health budget in the budget speech
 jisase saaf he ki is skim ke liye koi paisa abhi nahin diya gaya he
 This is the reason Chidambaram has called this health insurance scheme a perfect jumla

 He wanted all the players to focus on the game, not on the side
 khabaron kii maane, to kumble team kii deele ravaiye ko sudhaarna chaahate the
 Traveling, walking, shopping with family on foreign trips was not Kumble's choice
 3
 Commitment - Commitment was given considerable importance in the rules of Kumble

 viley parle ke satya college main maas com kii chaatra pradanya mandhare roj kii tarah class ke baad local train main ghar ja rahi thi
 From Kandivali station, she had to change the train for Borivali so she landed there
 vatting room main jab vah apni train kaa intjaar kar rahi thi, usee vakt nashe main dhut ek aadmi unase chhedchhad karne laga
 When Mandhare opposed him, he grabbed Mandhare
 iske baad mandhare ne us aadmi ko jhatakate hue apane bag se uski pitayee shuru kar di
 After this, Mandhare started a scuffle with the 25-year-old man who was completely drunk
 yah sab kandivali stesan par ho rahaa tha jahaan saikadon kii bheed tamaasha dekh rahi thi
 According to Mandhare, she was disappointed to see all this, but she did not lose courage and grabbed the attacker by hair and dragged her to GRP
 jiarapy chaowkee pahunchate hi pulisavaalon ne us vyakti ko giraftaar kaa medical test ke liye bhej diya
 The drunken person was identified as 25-year-old Chavan
 is ghatana ke baad mandhare kaa kahana he ki mahilaon ko mauka padane par marpet karne se bhi nahin chuknaa chahie
 However, when this incident was happening, he was disappointed to see the people watching the spectacle at the time
 akali dal ke adhyaksh or punjab ke purv upmukhyamantri sukhbir singh badal bhaajapa prem main kuch is tarah se duube najar aae ki unhone yahaan tak kah diya ki hindustan rahe yaa naa rahe lekin akali dal bhaajapa ke saath rahegaa
 This is the case on Sunday, when Punjab BJP chief Vijay Sampla, while addressing the 'bajao Dhol Kholo Pol' rally organized in Jalandhar by the Akali Dal and BJP, suddenly instructed his allies not to forget that The BJP does not have the support base
 bhaajapa adhyaksh kii hidaayat suakaali dal adhyaksh sukhbir badalko bhaajapa prem yaad aa gaya or unhone bhaajapa ko akali dal kaa bada bhai bataate hue yahaan tak kah diya ki agar bharat kaa astitv naa bhi rahe to bhi vah bhaajapa ke saath rahenge
 The Akali Dal organized the 'bajao Dhol Kholo Pol' rally to open the poll for a one-year term of the Punjab Congress government, but the ally BJP president opened the Akali Dal poll
 uske baad sukhbir badal ne kaha ki 'bhartiya janata partyshiromani akali dalka dil he, unako bhaajapa ke saath hi jeena or maranaa he
 Whether someone stays with the BJP or not, Hindustan or not, we will stay with you
 ' unke is bayaan se vivaad khadaa ho gaya he
 On his statement, the Bharatiya Janata Party defended Sukhbir Badal and said that he had no such intention, he mistakenly said so
 akali dal ne bhi kaha ki sukhbir badal kii baat kaa vyarth main bakheda khadaa kiya ja rahaa he jabaki unki aisi koi manshaa nahin thi
 Sukhbir Badal's tongue may have slipped but the bjp's mass base in the country, especially in the northeast, is increasing, now the BJP leaders of Punjab are also strong
 yahi kaaran he ki punjab bhaajapa adhyaksh ne bhare manch se akali dal ko jataa diya ki ab vah kam se kam janaadhar kii baat naa hi karen
 Explain that the bjp's vote bank in Punjab is much less than the Akali Dal, so the BJP formed an alliance with the Akali Dal
 mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne merit list main jagah paane vaale students ke liye skim kaa elaan kiya he

 Sonia said that the BJP wants to mislead people and implicate them in the face of caste-religion
 vah mili-juli samskruti or saamaajik sadbhaav ke saath khilwaad karke paap kar rahi he
 No other sin can be such a crime
 congress adhyaksh ne salimpur or kushinagar se party pratyaashiyon ke samarthan main yojit chunavi sabhaaon main modi par bahut talkh andaaj main barasate hue kaha 'jo vyakti kisi ek samudaay ke prati neech soch rakhata ho
 It is not right to give the country in the hands of one who harms the country's culture by its thinking, which breaks all the limits of the fall
 ' He said, 'many Prime Ministers came to our country
 atal bihari vaajapeyi bhi hamaare pradhanmantri rahe lekin unhone pad kii maryaada ko kaayam rakhaa
 Modi commented on Rajiv ji after 23 years of his martyrdom for political selfishness
 ise ochhaa naa kahen to kya kahen
 The person who is dreaming of becoming PM must take care of the culture, generosity of this great country
 aise bayaan desh kii raajnneeti ko shobhaa nahin detaa
 If his statement is like this, then it can be estimated
 ' Sonia said, 'india is a social fabric
 iskaa netritv karnaa maamuli baat nahin he
 Its leadership is based on renunciation and sacrifice, generosity and brotherhood, but how will the country be managed by those who have a stinging eye
 ' The Congress President said that the world is looking at and learning from the employment guarantee law and food security law implemented by the Congress-led government with respect, but the BJP wants to end these schemes
 isse uski garibon ke prati dwesh kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The Congress president said that the BJP wants to mislead people and implicate them in the face of caste-religion

 The current pace of progress in the country is the result of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's policies and the struggle of all
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki modi vikaas kii juthi tasviir dikhaakar vot hasil karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 He said, 'the condition in which Modi is building bridges of praise is different
 vahaan badi sankhya main bachche or mahilaayein kuposhit hai, 40 pratishat logon ko pine or sinchai kaa pani nahin miltaa
 Farmers are craving for basic amenities
 shame kii baat he ki vahaan kii sarkaar 11 rupee roj kamaane vaale ko garib nahin maanati
 ' unhone kaha 'aap to jaanate hai ki 11 rupee main kya miltaa he
 Even if we believe that this is true, 40 lakh families in Gujarat live below the poverty line
 sochiye agar gujarat kaa yah haal karne vaala vyakti pradhanmantri ban gaya to aapke bacchon kaa bhavishya kaisaa hoga
 ' sonia ne kaha 'modi ham par aatankwaad se ladane main kamajori kaa aarope bhi laga rahe hai
 You will remember when the BJP government remained at the center for six years, at that time thousands of people were killed in terrorist incidents in the country
 meri aakhon ke saamne vah pidaa kaa drishy he
 It is difficult to express the hardship suffered during the Amarnath Yatra attack, Nandigram, Lal Chouk, and many places
 ' Sonia claimed that the steps taken by the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) have resulted in a reduction in terrorist incidents
 aantarik or bahari suraksha se jude maamalon par congress ne hameshaa sakhti se saamana kiya or aage bhi karegi
 Sonia said that a country can protect borders only when the barn fields are green
 samprag sarkaar ne sainikon ke liye 'van rank van pension' lagu kiya
 This demand of soldiers was going on since the time of bjp-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) but they did not accept
 unhone kaha ki samprag sarkaar ne kisaanon kaa karj maaf kiya, kharid mulya doguna badhaayaa
 Many concrete steps will also be taken in the interest of farmers
 badi sankhya main kisaanon ko labhanvit karne ke liye chote or seemaant kisaanon ko paanch lakh tak kaa aasaan karj, sinchai ke liye pariyojna, talab, charaagaah or murgi paalan ke kaaryakramon ko rashtriya gramin rojgaar guarantee yojana se joda jayega
 Sonia said that this time the government will be given the right to free medicines and treatment in the hospital, and the right to pension for the elderly
 tarakkee ke is daur main bhi log jhopadiyon main rahete hai or shaharon main panni kii chat ke neeche jindagi bitaate hai, congress aise logon ko pakki chat kaa kanoonee adhikaar degi
 It will give employment opportunities to young people by making them skillful
 sonia ne kaha 'is chunaav main aapke saamne ve log hai jo saamaajik bhaichaare par vishwaas nahin karte
 They divide society, want to take the country where power and wealth are in a few hands and the voice of the weak is suppressed
 duusari taraf congress ne desh kii akhandta banaae rakhane ke liye qurbaani di he
 Our ideology envisions an open free society where everyone's voice is heard

 In view of the rush of candidates in military recruitment and to control it, the army has now made it mandatory for the eligible candidates to join the online registration
 sena kii yah nai vyavastha lagu ho gai he or iske liye ek bevesite kii bhi shuruyaat kar di gai he
 Director General of Army Recruitment, Lieutenant General RN Nair, who came to inaugurate the temporary selection center North in Kapurthala, Punjab, told reporters after the program, when the rallies are held for recruitment in the army, then the crowd of candidates who attended it was so Increases that lathicharge has to be done, and other such means are adopted to control the crowd
 le ja nair ne bataaya, sena ne isse nipatane ke liye yah nirnay kiya he ki isamen shaamil hone vaale ummidavaaron ko pehle online registration karwaanaa hoga
 After this, the eligible candidates will be called for a recruitment rally on a different number of days after selecting qualified candidates from there
 iskaa sabase bada phayda hoga ki raily main aane vaali bheed aniyantrit nahin hogi
 He told that this new system has been started from today
 iske liye sena ne ek bevesite kii bhi shuruyaat kar di he, jise pichley 24 ghante main hi 40 hajaar logon ne clic kiya he
 Earlier, the military officer said that every year 60 thousand army personnel posts are vacant in the whole country and on the basis of RMP (recurrent Man Population), quota is allocated to the states, under which Punjab's quota is on average 1400 every year
 Is close to tippaniyan When asked about the news of the decline in the number of army recruits in Punjab, the Lieutenant General dismissed it and said, "this news is completely false
" punjab main sena main bhartee kii sankhya har saal bad rahi he or punjab kaa yogadan arempi se kahin adhik he
 He said, in the last three years, there has been a steady increase in the figures of Punjab in the army recruitment
 punjab ke alaava uttar bharat ke kai aise rajya hai, jo arempi se adhik apana yogadan de rahe hai
 Earlier, the selection center was inaugurated by Lance Nayak, stationed at Kapurthala Military Station in the presence of Lt
 General NPS Hira and other military officers, General Officer Commanding of Nair and Vajra Corps
 centre ke udghaatan ke baad le ja nair ne kaha, desh main pehle se maujuud teen sellection centre main hone vaali bheed ko kam karne ke liye uttar bharat main ek aise centre kii aavashyaktaa thi, jiske liye punjab sarkaar ne ropar main sena ko jameen di he
 Considering the time taken to build the infrastructure, it has been temporarily started in Kapurthala
 baad main ise ropar sthanantarit kar diya jayega
 In response to another question, Nair said that there is a shortage of 6-7 thousand military officers in the army
 punjab ke kapoorthala main asthaayee sellection centre north kaa udghaatan karne aae sena ke bhartee mahanideshak leftinent general aar en nair ne kaarykram ke baad samvaadadaataaon se kaha, sena main bhartee ke liye jab reliyaan yojit kii jaati hai to kabhi usamen hissaa lene vaale ummidavaaron kii bheed itani bad jaati he ki lathicharge karnaa padataa he, or bheed ko niyantrit karne ke liye is tarah ke duusare anya saadhan apanaae jate hai
 Le Nair said, in order to deal with this, the Army has decided that the candidates joining it will have to first register online
 iske baad vahaan se yogya ummidavaaron kaa chayan kar simit sankhya main alag-alag din bhartee raily ke liye bulaayaa jayega
 The biggest advantage will be that the crowd coming to the rally will not be uncontrolled
 unhone bataaya ki is nai vyavastha kii shuruyaat aaj se kar di gai he
 For this, the army has started a website, which has been clicked by 40 thousand people in the last 24 hours

 The comments punjab main sena main bhartee kii sankhya main giravat aane kii khabaron ke bare main puche jane par leftinent general ne ise khaarij karte hue kaha, yah khabar puri tarah galat he
 The number of army recruits in Punjab is increasing every year and the contribution of Punjab is more than RMP
 unhone kaha, pichley teen saal main sena main bhartee main punjab ke aankade main lagaataar badhottaree hui he
 Apart from Punjab, there are many states in North India, which are contributing more than RMP

 On 15 August 2014, when Modi made his first speech as Prime Minister, he presented himself as an outsider who needed to transform the country, eliminate the policy paralysis of the previous government and slow down the economy
 The mandate to rejuvenate was achieved
 unhone kai abhinav kaaryakramon kaa elaan kiya tha jinamein unka sabase khaas svachh bharat abhiyaan bhi shaamil tha
 Four years later, in 2018, Modi has become an absolute person and the supreme command is in his hands
 unhone puri vaak patutaa ke saath harek kshetra main or garib, pichde, kisaan, madhyam varg, kaarobaari, noujvaan or mahila har tabake ke liye apni sarkaar ke kaam or uplabdhiyaan ginaayin
 The great thing about the Prime Minister's speech was this - my government has shown it
 unhen pataa tha ki may 2019 main hone vaale aam chunaavon se pehle raashtra ko sambodhit karne kaa yah unke liye aakhri mauka hoga
 Therefore, Modi used this platform as the beginning of the campaign for his return to power
 unhone "new india'' or vikaas ke nae daur kii tasviir pesh kii, jisamen "sabake liye ghar, bijli, pani, alpiji, shauchalay, hunar, swasthya, beemaa or connactivity hogi
 In this way he set the agenda which will not only have wide appeal across the country, but which his opponents will find difficult to match
 to, modi kaa doosraa bada sandesh tha—mere paas vah vijan, mishan or jajba he jo 2019 se bhi aage jaataa he—isliye mujhe phir vot do
 Modi's new indiamodi supporters are confident that this will not be his last speech on Independence Day and he is sure to win his second term
 phir bhi saal main do baar hone vaale india today group-karvi incits desh kaa mizaaj janamat surveykshan ke nateezon se unka yah vishwaas hill janaa chahie
 The survey casts doubt on the prospect of Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) winning the same majority in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as they had achieved in the 2014 general election
 july main kiya gaya desh kaa mizaaj shrunkhlaa kaa yah tazatreen surveykshan batalaata he ki july, 2017 ke survey main bhaajapa ko 298 siton kii jo aaramdaayak badhat hasil hui thi, vah ghatakar 245 siton par aa gai he—jo apane dam par bahumat ke liye jaruri 272 siton se 27 kam hai
 The survey also suggests that the BJP along with its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) allies will somehow retain power with 281 seats, which will make the party strong and vulnerable in the face of pressure and pressure from coalition partners
 bhaajapa ke liye or bhi zyada chintajanak surveykshan ke anumaan se vah sambhaavna he jisamen vipaksh agar ekajute ho jaataa he or mahagathbandhan bana letaa he jisamen mukhya rup se congress, trinmul congress (tiemasi), samaajawaadee party, bahujan samaaj party or janata dal (secular) honge
 If that happens, this alliance can win up to 224 seats and come on par with the NDA whose seats will be reduced to 228
 aise main sansad trishanku hogi
 bjp's own seats will come down to 194
 tab bhi haalanki vah sabase badi party hogi, par sarkaar banane ke liye use apni sahyogi partiyon or partiyon kii tut-foot par buree tarah nirbhar rahanaa padegaa
 In such a situation, Modi's credibility as the most powerful leader of bjp's vote will get a severe blow and doubts will emerge in the NDA allies over his acceptance as Prime Minister
 shaayad modi khud bhi partiyon ke aise jhund ke dam par hukumat karne ke icchhuk na hon kyonki tab aise gathbandhan ko chalaane main unhen mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he jisamen unki baat us tarah bedadak nahin suni jaaegi jaise abhi suni jaati he
 The survey also considers a third possibility, in which the AIADMK joins the NDA
 agar aisa hota he, tab bhi endie kaa gathbandhan bahumat se peeche rah saktaa he
 So, despite all the achievements that Modi has made, why is it that people in the mood of the country are full of doubts and do not want to give absolute majority to Modi and BJP? One thing is that the number of people satisfied with the functioning of the government is still good but has continued to fall — it has fallen from the highest level of 71 per cent in the January 2017 survey to around 56 per cent
 modi ke liye utsahjanak baat yah he ki unhen ab bhi 49 fisadi ke saath pradhanmantri banane ke liye ab tak kaa sabase acha netaa mana ja rahaa he—kaarykaal ke chauthe saal main yah kisi bhi maandand se acchhee he
 But he is no longer as popular as he was a year and a half ago when his rating was at 65 per cent
 bhaajapa ke samarthakon ke liye yah baat bhi pareshaan karne vaali ho sakati he ki survey dikhaata he ki rahul gandhi kii lokapriyata phir ubhaar par he or unki reating janvari, 2017 ke survey ke 10 fisadi ke nichle str se badhkar is baar 27 fisadi par aa gai he
 Modi and he still have a huge gap of 22 percentage points, but it shows that Congress President Kenate Rahul Gandhi is emerging as a challenger and the graph of his image is constantly increasing
 ek or vajah yah he ki harek pradhanmantri ko un teen buniyadi muddon par jarur kaam karke dikhaanaa hi hoga jinhen harek desh kaa mizaaj survey chintaaon kii fehrist main sabase upar rakhata he—naukariyaan, keemton main badhotaree or bhrashtachar par lagaam
 Our latest survey shows that curbing corruption is still seen as one of Modi's greatest successes — stern action against black money, reduction of corruption within the government and demonetisation have led to 44 per cent support
 jiesti laane, svachh bharat or buniyadi dhaanche ke vikaas kaaryakramon ke liye jahaan unki peeth thapthapai gai he, vahiin endie sarkaar kii kai duusari yojanaon ko thandi pratikriya mili he jinamein bahut jorshor se prachaarit jan dhan yojana, digital india or pratyaksh laabh hastantaran shaamil hai
 The survey on controlling inflation shows that the problem is increasing for them because the perception is that the price hike has crossed the danger mark
 naukari ko lekar mushkil he barinaukariyon kii kami pradhanmantri kii chintaa kii asli vajah he
 The lack of jobs is the biggest failure of the Modi government, the percentage of people who believe it was 22 percent in the previous survey has increased to 29 percent in this survey
 haalanki pradhanmantri baar-baar karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi register ke aankadon kaa hawala dekar yah bataane kii koshish karte hai ki unki sarkaar ke kaarykaal main naukariyon main baari sankhya main vruddhi hui he or paryaton, nirmaan kshetra or vimaanan jaise kshetra, jinamein rojgaar ke bahut zyada avasar paidaa hote hai, ne pichley chaar varshon main tej gati se vikaas kiya he jinase nai naukariyaan paidaa huin hai
 Demonetisation proved to be suicidal as people feel that it destroyed the informal sector
 aise logon kii bhi sankhya main khaasi badhat hui he jo yah maanate hai ki narendra modi kaa "achche din'' kaa vaada bas ek chunavi jumala tha
 In January 2017, 24 percent believed it, at the moment 43 percent of the people have had similar perception about the Prime Minister
 haalanki unki kul reating bhale hi kam ho gai ho, phir bhi modi ne videsh niti ke alaava peyajal, bijli, sadak or rail sampark badhaane jaise kshetron main jo kaam kiya he, uski surveykshan main bahut prashansa hui he
 Many factors are also appearing in Modi's favor in the upcoming general election
 2019 ke chunaav bamushkil nau maheene dur hai
 Despite this, the opposition has neither been able to form a strong coalition nor has a strong agenda to challenge Modi
 modi virodhiyon ke paas koi vaikalpik drushtikon nahin he jisase ve janata ko yah samajha saken ki unke paas bhaajapa se behatar sarkaar dekar desh ko aage le jane kii kshamta he
 It is unlikely that people will forget the performance of the last years of the UPA government so easily, because the poor work of the last years, the people had forgotten all the achievements of the UPA government
 rahul gandhi ke udai ke baavjood, modi abhi bhi rajnatik paridrishy main shikhar par dikhte hai
 The opposition may be strong in multiplication, but Modi is rich in the art of connecting with the masses
 gujarat or karnataka chunaav main bhi modi factor hi bhaajapa ko badhat dilaa gaya
 Ballast Beshuramodi averaged 7 economic growth rates
 5 pratishat tak pahunchaa diya he jiskaa shrey unhen diya janaa chahie lekin ve is baat se waakif hai ki logon kii aakankshaon, khaastaur se naukariyon ke morche par khara utarane ke liye vikaas dar ko do ankon tak pahunchane kii jarurat he
 The drowning of bad debts of public sector banks has caused deep damage to their operations
 nijee nivesh sthir he, niryaat gir rahaa he or automation badha he or utpaadan kshetra utani naukariyaan paidaa nahin kar paaya, jitani usne pichley dashak main kii thim
 The agrarian crisis remains constant and instead of trying to overcome it, the government has only put a little ointment on its injuries
 isse sabase garib tabake main rojgaar sankat badhaayaa he
 Indian voters know that in such a difficult situation a mature, hardworking, honest and determined Prime Minister will be needed to handle the country
 or isiilie ve modi ko sabase behatar maanate hai
 Modi's personal integrity and honesty have never been questioned
 jo log unke saath kaam karte hai ve modi kii us kshamta ke bare main bataate hai ki kaise modi apane dwaara shuru kiye gaye vibhinn kaaryakramon kii kadigoon ko jodakar use agle ucch str par le jane kii duuradrushti rakhte hai
 He personally keeps an eye on the progress of these schemes, unhappy with the pace of progress and continues to push the goal forward to take its advantage to the last corner
 aakhri dhakkamodi ne ab tak vikaas kii mul baton par dhyaan kendrit kiya he jo acchhee baat he
 But they know that if India is to stand in the line of developed nations and become powerful, then an extraordinary economic change will be urgently needed
 unke ek sahyogi isaki tulana aawaaj kii gati se tej udaye vaale vimaan se karte hai or modi prakriyaaon kii gati tej karne ko lekar adheer hai jo praudyogiki, kaushal, vipanan, paardarshita, gati or eemaandaaree main bada badlaav laaegi
 In his Independence Day speech, the Prime Minister talked about modernizing agriculture from seed-to-market, enhancing quality and making this sector more export-oriented 
 haalanki in udaar aadarshon ko vaastaviktaa kii kasuti par kasakar jaanchane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The mood of this country has a big message for Modi — Modi will have to be more inclusive, especially to his colleagues, because he will support them when needed
 unki sarkaar jatigat sangharshon, goraksha ke naam par bheedtantr ke updrav jaise aantarik suraksha ke muddon se nibatane ko lekar kathghare main rahati he
 In his Independence Day speech, Modi said that his government will deal with those who violate law and order more vigorously
 pradhanmantri ko rudyard kipoling kii kitaab jangal book se bhi sabak lenaa chahie, jisamen mughali or sabhi jaanavar doharaate hai, "yah jangal kaa kanoon he, akaash ke jitna purana or sachcha; or jo bhedipha ise banaae rakhega vah fal-phool saktaa he, lekin jo bhedipha ise todgha uskaa maranaa tay he
 The law moves back and forth as the vine is wrapped around the trunk of a tree; Because the strength of the flock is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the flock
 '' modi bharat ke rajnatik jangal main sher hai, lekin unhen party, sarkaar or desh ko majboot tathaa ekajute rakhane ke liye jamini hakikaton ko swikaarne or apane bheetar utaarne kii jarurat he

 ) iram loj, ranchi, 15 aktubar, 2013
 Three months after the audacious attack on the Mahabodhi temple in Bodh Gaya, 30-year-old Abu Faizal began opening his friend Mujibullah's phone
 faijal kabhi indore main homeopathy kaa course kar rahaa tha or ab bhagoda ghoshit ho chukaa he
 Both were hiding in a room with their friends
 phone ko khangalate hue faijal ek audio clip par rukaa jise ranchi ke daronda college ke manovigyaan ke chaatr haidar ali, urf blike beauty ne apni aawaaj main taiyaar kiya tha
 The clip claimed responsibility for the blasts in Bodh Gaya on 7 July that year
 jaisaa mujibulla ne baad main bataaya, un logon kaa iraadaa ise 'recruitment material’ ke rup main aplod karnaa tha
 But this intention was abandoned because his group, working in secret, did not want to reveal its identity until further attacks were carried out
 iram loj main us din jamaavade kaa makasad agle bade hamale kii ulti ginati shuru karnaa tha, haalanki jaanch agenciyaan bodhgaya visphoton par andhere main haath maar rahi thim
 She was suspicious of lashkar-e-toiba as its leaders expressed sympathy with the sufferings of the Rohingya Muslims of Myanmar
 faijal or mujibulla ne kuch din baad ek-duusare se vidaa lee or aglaa mishan puraa karne ke baad 28 aktubar ko usee loj main milane kaa vaada bhi kiya
 On 27 October, Narendra Modi's rally in Patna was attacked
 alqaida kii inspire patrika prachaarit, albo aakaar ke kai bam gandhi maidan main raily sthal ke kai pravesh dwaaron par lagaae gaye
 The police were chasing Faizal anyway
 dakaiti ke kuch maamalon main khandwa jail main band faijal vahaan se bhaag niklaa tha
 He told the police that he was not present in Bihar capital Patna at the time of the blast, nor did he know about this plan
 lekin neshnal investigeshan agency (enie) kii poochtacha kaa record india today ke haath laga he, uske mutabik faijal visphotak hamalon se kai hafte pehle ranchi ke nikat ek gaanv main haidar se mila tha
 There was also Imtiaz Ali, an accused in the Patna attacks, who was arrested from the spot after the attack
 faijal ko do maheene baad 18 disambar, 2013 ko madhya pradesh police ne gulberga jate hue giraftaar kar liya
 He was going to meet one of his companions
 unki yojana 2002 ke dangon kaa badla lene ke liye bajrang dal ke daftar par hamale kii thi
 The information about Haider and Mujibullah proved to be decisive for the investigating agencies, when they realized that a new terrorist group had set up in the city
 adhikari ise 'fresh modul’ naam bhi dete hai
 They believed that the attack was an act of the Indian Mujahideen (IM), which is trying to bring new trouble in the country
 lekin adhikariyon kaa anumaan is baar bhi galat tha
 In the next five months, it was to be proved that the attacks were carried out by a well-known organization, but in a new way
 aatankwaadi pratibandhit gut students islamic movement of india (simi) kii kokh se niklaa ugravadi-krantikari gut tha
 However, the details of the incident began to be found only after the NIA caught Hyder and Mujibullah near Ranchi on May 22, before a big picture had begun to appear
 padtaal enie ko simi ke ugravadi gut ke pramukh vichaarak safadar nagauri ke kareeb le gai, jise november, 2008 ko giraftaar kar liya gaya tha lekin har naveenatam ghatana kii use jaankaree rahati thi
 In such a situation, the arrest of Faizal proved to be important
 nagauri ne jo bataaya, usase ranneeti main badlaav kii pushti ho gai
 Sim (nagauri told investigators in Delhi that his group has decided to remove the 'I'
 ) pehle yah gut aatanki gut taiyaar karne ke liye ranneetik madad or jehadi muhaiyaa karwaata tha lekin ab isane khud hamale karne kaa jimmaa le liya he, sambhavat: bade netaaon kii hatya karne kaa
 The tribunal, headed by the Delhi High Court, on July 30 approved the decision to ban the ban again for the next five years, with agencies trying to decide which of the new factions linked to SIMI is now ready
 16 may ko aam chunaav ke parinaam vaale din bhopal kii ek adaalat main simi ke giraftaar aaparatives ne naaraa lagaaya, ''abaki baar modi kaa number
 "of course, the security agencies came in awe and started reviewing their security arrangements before the future Prime Minister from Badhwasi reached Delhi
 enie kii poochtacha patna visphot cese ke aaropapatr kaa hissaa ho sakati he
 In an inquiry by Special Cell of the Delhi Police, Nagauri said that after the ban in 2001, it was decided in the meetings of simi's Central Representatives Council (CRC), also known as majlis-e-shura, that in addition to 'ideological supplements', physical Training should also be emphasized, as in the branches of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)
 vyaktiyon ko nijee str par marshall art training jarur kerani chahie
 Nagauri also stated that SIM is the product of the same militant group that he started in SIMI
 simi main foot ke sanket 2006 main hi saamne aane shuru ho gaye the, jab sadsyta kii aayu seemaa 30 saal tay karne kaa faisla kiya gaya, yah faisla sanghathan kaa yuva-chaatr charitra banaae rakhane ke liye kiya gaya
 Because of this Nagori's membership ended
 lekin is faisle se khinn hokar nagauri gut ne july main ujjain ke nikat ek farm house main baithak karne kaa faisla kiya
 The demand for a separate faction first arose here and the young student who raised it was Ehtesham Siddiqui, but other members of the faction believed that all this should be waited for now
 baithak ke turant baad hi siddiki ko mumbai visphoton main kathith rup se shaamil hone ke aarope main giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Although he claims to be innocent
 nagauri ne jaanchakartaaon ko bataaya ki giraftaar se pehle, do cametiyaan gathit karne kaa faisla kiya gaya, ek akhil bhartiya islamic andolan ke liye or duusari hamalon ko anjaam dene ke liye khoonkhaar aatanki gut kii sthapana vyavastha ke liye
 This led to the creation of another leading organization of SIMI - Muslim Students Federation (MSF), which was formed by Hidayatullah, a resident of Ranchi
 vah ab patna visphot maamle main enie kaa gavaah he
 Nagauri also claims that he had personally suggested revenge for the killings during communal riots and the use of petrol bombs
 "the SIM made jihad its main agenda and considered Mullah Omar to be the 'international Amir'
" samaan maansikta vaale muslim sanghathanon or muslim deshon se samvaad sthapit karne ke prayaas kiye gaye
 SIM was willing to send its cadres to fight Jihad in Afghanistan, even merging with the Taliban faction
 esaiem ke abdul subhaan ko taliban ke mullah umr se sampark karne kaa kaam saunpa gaya
 Nagori claims, "I too asked former SIMI president CAM Basheer living in the UAE to contact Omar
 ” uskaa kahana he ki yadi umr se sampark ho jaataa to unka gut 'hizrat’ (janmabhumi se dur janaa) ke liye taiyaar tha
 The murders will continue for vengeance until this happens
 dhire-dhire prashikshan ke tareeke bhi badalte gaye
 Nagauri says that he organized several training modules, where ideological encouragement was still paramount, but was later changed
 2012 main haidar or anya sadasyon ne bam banane kaa prashikshan dena shuru kar diya
 He even learned to make 'a jacket bomb' that was to be used in the Patna blast
 ise banane kaa tarika usne internet se siikhaa tha
 Initial interrogations from the Fazal reveal that a change in strategy began in 2007–08, when the group started attacking
 hamale ke shikaar bahut bade nahin lekin mahatvapurn avashya the
 For example: BJP councilor Pramod Tiwari from Khandwa 2008: After Nagauri's arrest, Faizal and his associates attempted to kill Tiwari which failed
 uskaa daawa he ki tiwari muslimon ke khilaaf dangon main shaamil the
 "in October 2008, Pramod Tiwari, along with Mehboob and Amjad, was shot and badly injured," Faizal said during interrogation
 ”satna jail main jailer sanjay pandey, 2009: faijal kaa daawa he ki usne hatya kii yojana banaai lekin safal nahin ho sakaa
 He wanted to kill Pandey because in Indore jail Pandey tortured Safdar (nagauri) brother and other companions
 hawaldaar seetaram, madhya pradesh aties, khandwa, 2009: pratishodh kii ek or yojana banaai gai
 Faizal says that this time he was successful, "on the day of Bakrid we went towards Sitaram's house and started following him
 hamane uski motor cycle roki or teen goliyaan maarin
 He died on the spot
 ”shiv pratap singh, 2011, ratlam: is baar faijal ne apane saathi jakir ko is kaam kaa jimmaa saunpa
 This time, he allegedly killed Singh as he abused the families of SIMI members
 bhairu laal tang, sthaneey vihip netaa, nagda, ujjain, 2011: tang par hamale ke liye do simi kaaryakartaaon- sharafat or farhat ko tay kiya gaya
 But Faizal claims that he took the responsibility himself, "I went to Nagda to meet Farhat and Sharafat
 or agle din use goli maar di
 But Tang survived
 ” yah ek naakaam prayaas tha
 SIMI and IM: SIMI cadre is considered to be the first choice if a terrorist organization has to provide all kind of help in different rahabharat
 isliye iem oparatives kuch joshilay simi sadasyon ke saath dosti kar lete hai
 For example, Tehseen Akhtar was arrested in 2014, was involved in the Bihar module of IM and was considered an explosive expert
 usne patna visphot ke mukhya abhiyukt haidar ali ke ranchi sthit ghar main panaah lee thi
 Another SIMI activist Manjar Imam, now arrested, allegedly helped several IM operatives to find safe havens in Karnataka and Kerala
 iem oparative asadulla akhtar or yaccin bhatkal or mirza shaadaab beg ke bich internet chat record se kaaphi saboot mil jate hai
 Akhtar and Bhatkal were arrested last year
 mirza shaadaab beg tab pakistan main tha
 The NIA obtains a chat from Akhtar's laptop, in which Beg asks Azhtar, a resident of Azamgarh, to contact two SIMI members, including Shadab
 unhen training ke liye pakistan bheja janaa he
 But as Haider reported after his arrest, SIMI decided to part ways because it did not want to have any connection with let, which is allegedly controlled by Pakistan's ISI
 nagauri se haidar ko lagaataar yahi sandesh aate rahe ki sanghathan ne taliban or alqaida se sangrakshan kii guhaar lagaai thi lekin faijal kaa kahana he ki jab aisa nahin ho sakaa to duusare aantki guton ke saath sampark kiya, jo alqaida or taliban se sambhddha samajhe jate hai, jaise pakistan kaa jaish-e-mohammad (jeiem)
 In 2011 Ejaz, a SIMI worker, was sent to Saudi Arabia, but that mission also failed
 faijal kaa kahana he, ''hamane ejaj ko haj par bhejne kii yojana banaai taaki vah jaish-e-mohammad ke kaaryakartaaon se mil sake
 On the JEM website it is written that anyone who can give Mujahideen sacrifices on Haj can contact on the number given on the website
 maine yah number ejaj ko diya or jeiem se sampark karne ko kaha
 But JEM did not trust Ejaz and asked him to go to Dhaka
 ejaj waapas aa gaya or bangladesh main ek hotel main thahar gaya
 Ijaz tried to contact JEM but was asked to go to China
 ejaj vahaan nahin ja paaya kyonki hamaare paas iske liye paise nahin the
 "but the attacks that have been planned and carried out so far make it clear that the new faction that is growing in the country is dangerous and resourceful without external help
 isaki sankhya kaa sahi andaaj lagaana to kathin he lekin jaanchakartaaon kaa kahana he ki iske oparation 12 rajyon main faile hai (dekhen graphic)
 In addition, the group targets young students and makes them acquainted with the objectives
 jab ranchi main haidar kii adhyakshata vaale madul kaa bhandaphod hua to sabase kam umr kaa recruit ek naaballig tha jisane bodhgaya hamale main kathith rup se hissaa liya tha
 The ban works? The emergence of the new SIMI from the shadow of terror again raises the question whether the ban on such groups is helpful in controlling them or the ban becomes neutralized after strengthening support from militant groups
 jaanch agenciyaan aise guton kii gatividhiyon par niyantran na rakh paane ke liye rajya sarkaron par sara dosha thope detii hai, tark kaa doosraa pahalu yah he ki centre ke paas aisi vyavastha nahin he ki vibhinn rajyon or jilon se khabar jutakar aisi gatividhiyon kii badi tasviir taiyaar kar sake
 On the other hand, MS Khan, a senior lawyer representing several SIMI activists, questions the veracity of exposing such cases, "agencies arrested innocent people under the guise of sanctions
" unka jivan khatre main he or parivaar bhi khatra mahasoos kar rahe hai
 "ajay Sahni of the Institute of Conflict Management has a different view," These restrictions help agencies take control of groups and organizations
 simi ke maamle main yah pratibandh kargar rahaa
 Many members have distanced themselves from the organization's membership after it was considered a crime
 ” lekin saahani bhi maanate hai ki ''jab sirf simi kaa sadsy hone kii vajah se bekasoor logon ko giraftaar kiya jaataa he to kanoon lagu karne main dikkat aati he
 "special Commissioner of Delhi Police
 en
 Srivastava, who is in charge of the Special Cell Inspection and who has been involved in such inquiries, believes, "the ban on SIMI has put a check on its illegal activities
" ”phir bhi saat saal tak simi ek krantikari sanghathan se hathiyaaron main prashikshit gut main viksit ho gaya he
 Nagauri revealed that his associates had found several local hideouts in 2004–05
 tab tak unhone kuta naamon (code nem) kaa prayog shuru kar diya tha or hossain, mushabir, safwan, ikbaal or musaab jaise chhadam naamon kaa istemaal karne lage the
 This change could not be stopped
 or yah maan liya gaya ki agar koi cheez asar dikhaa rahi he to vah he iem
 All this was happening at a time when SIMI was banned and it was believed that SIMI had died, but in reality it was getting stronger
 apana cader taiyaar karne ke baad simi ab aatank kii duniya kaa nayaa sadsy he
 Its reach in new form is large and the intentions are even bigger
 loksabhaa chunaav kii ghoshnaa ke saath hi vivaad bhi shuru ho gaya he
 While Muslim religious leaders have expressed their displeasure over the voting on May 6, May 12 and May 19 due to Ramadan, the BJP MLA from Madhya Pradesh has now asked the Election Commission to reconsider, citing Hindu festivals
 hindu tithiyon kaa bhi rakhaa jaae dhyaan: BJP vidhayakamadhya pradesh bijepi ke pradesh upaadhyaksh or bijepi vidhayak rameshwar sharma kaa bayaan saamne aayaa he
 Talking to 'aaj Tak', Rameshwar Sharma has said that 'election Commission should also take care of Hindu dates as May 6 to May 21 are the auspicious occasions for Akshaya Tritiya, Buddha Purnima and weddings in which millions of votes will be affected'
 rameshwar sharma ne kaha he ki 'nirvachan tithi tay karte samay sabhi raajnneetik dal baithte hai or congress, sapa jo bahut chaati peetate hai ki ham musalamaanon ke hitaishi hai, unako ramajaan kii tithiyon kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie tha'
 Rameshwar Sharma said that 'hindus also have problems because if seen, Akshaya Tritiya will remain on 6th and 7th
 akshay tritiya main deshbhar main lakhon vivaah hote hai
 People go to the wedding
 rishtedaar bhi aate hai to matdaan isse bhi prabhavit hoga
 At the same time, Buddha Purnima is being celebrated on 18th and 19th
 yah poornima aisi he ki deshbhar ke andar snaan daan sabhi pavitra nadiyon ke tat par lakhon shraddhalu nahaane jate hai or 24-24, 48-48 ghante ke meley lagate hai to matdaan yahaan bhi prabhavit hoga'
 Rameshwar Sharma said that 'if the Election Commission takes note of their demands, then the Election Commission should also take care of our demands, because when the procession comes out in lakhs of marriages and people go to the procession, then lakhs of voters will also move from here'
 jamiyat ulema ko bhi aitarajaramajaan ke dauraan matdaan kii tarikhon par jamiyat ulema madhya pradesh ko bhi aitraaj he
 State President of Jamiat Ulama Haji Mohammad Haroon has claimed that this will affect the voting of Muslims
 'ajtak' se baat karte hue haji haaron ne kaha ki 'ellection kamishan ne chunaav ke bare main elaan kiya ki yah hamaare bharat ke ganatantr ke liye jaruri he or ham iskaa swaagat karte hai kyonki chunaav 5 saal main hote hai
 He said, 'ramadan Mubarak is the most important faridas of Muslims and usually the routine of Muslims changes during the month of Ramadan
 din bhar rojaa rakhte hai or der raat tak namaaj, taraabi or ibaadat main mashgool rahete hai, aise maukey par ramajaan sharif kaa khyaal kiya janaa tha'
 According to Haji Harun "if this is not done or the program is not converted, then a large number of Muslims become weak within the fast
" bujurg bhi hote hai, mahilaayein bhi hoti hai
 It will not have much effect on the youth, but the elderly and women take rest in the day due to worship at night
 vahiin ellection ke andar lambii lambii kataren hoti hai
 Special arrangements should be made that Rojedars should be allowed to vote quickly
 agar lambii lambii kataron main log honge to voting kaa pratishat bahut kam ho jayega
 Therefore, we request the Election Commission to revisit the dates or else it will affect the voting percentage of Muslims'

 ) There are also many veteran singers who are fond of songs sung by Manna Dey
 unhone gaaya 'sur naa saje kya gaauun main
 
 ' lekin gaate rahe, sabko lubhaate rahe
 Then sang 'live here die here' but stayed in this world! Manna is no longer in this world, but millions of hearts are inhabited by her velvety voice and unique style of singing
 shastreey gayan main paarangat manna apni gayan style se shabdon ke peeche chhipe bhav ko khubsuurati se saamne le aate the
 Many contemporary singers of the time including his contemporary singers Mohammed Rafi and Mahendra Kapoor were huge admirers of Manna Dey
 unka vaastavik naam prabodh chandra de tha
 He was also fondly called 'manna Da'
 gayak kaa janm kalakatta (kolkata) main ek may, 1919 ko hua tha
 His mother's name was Mahamaya and father's name was Purnachandra Dey
 unhone praarambhik shiksha indu baburpur paathshaala se grahan karne ke baad vidyasagar college se snaatak kiya
 He also took part in wrestling and boxing competitions
 unke pita unhen vakil bananaa chaahate the
 But Manna loved Adavat, not the court
 is suprasiddh gayak ne sangeet kii praarambhik shiksha apane chachaa krishna chandra de se praapt kii thi
 Once, while Ustad Badal Khan and Manna Dey's uncles were doing Riyaz together, the boy Manna was also singing in the next room
 badal khan ne krishna chandra de se poocha ki yah koun ga rahaa he, to unhone manna de ko bulaayaa
 He had recognized his talent and since then Manna started learning music from his uncle
 unhone hindustani shastreey sangeet kaa prashikshan ustad dabeer khan, ustad aman ali khan or ustad abdul rahamaan khan se liya tha
 Manna Dey moved to Mumbai with her uncle to make a mark in the field of music in the 1940s
 vahaan unhone bataur sahaayak sangeet nirdeshak pehle apane chachaa ke saath, phir sachin dev varman ke saath kaam kiya
 As a playback singer, Manna first sang with Suraiya for the film 'tamanna' (1942)
 haalanki usase pehle vah film 'ram rajya' main samoohgaan main shaamil hue the
 The interesting thing about this film is that it was the only film that Mahatma Gandhi saw
 pehali baar ekal gayak ke rup main unhen sangeetkaar shankar raav vyas ne 'ram rajya' (1943) film kaa geet 'gai tu gai sita sati' gane kaa mauka diya
 He wrote 'O Prem Deewani Sambhal Ke Chalna' (kadambari-1944), 'ae Duniya Zara (kamala-1946)', 'hi Ye Hai' (beast of the Jungle 1951), "pyaar Hua Iqrar Hua (shree 420-1955) , Sang many songs like 'ye Raat Bheegi Bheegi' (chori-chori-1956), but the song 'aye Mere Pyare Vatan' from the 1961 film 'kabuli Wala' took Manna Dey to fame
 manna de shastreey sangeet par aadhaarit kathin geet gane ke shaukeen the
 She sang songs such as 'ask me how i spent the night', 'sur na saaje kya gao main', and 'tu pyar ka sagar hai teri ik boond ke pyaise hum'
 manna de shastreey sangeet main paarangat the, magar kishor kumaar ko sangeet kaa shastreey gyaan zyada nahin tha
 When the song 'ek Chatur Naar Badi Hoshiyar' from the film 'padosan' (1968) was being recorded, producer Mahmood said that the song is light-hearted as Rajendra Krishna wrote the song, but Manna Dey did not agree
 unhone ise apane hi andaaj main gaaya
 Manna Dey did not like it when Kishore Kumar sang Mukhara
 jaise-taise is gane kii recordig kii gai
 Famous poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan, influenced by Manna Dey, gave him an opportunity to sing and recite his immortal composition 'madhushala'
 unki gayaki se saji aakhri hindi film 'umr' thi
 Manna Dey was married on 18 December 1953 to Sulochana Kumaran of Kerala
 unki do betiyaan shuroma or sumita hai
 His wife died of cancer in 2012
 film 'mere hujur' (1969), bangla film 'nishi padma' (1971) or 'meraa naam joker' (1970) ke liye unhen sarvshereshth pashrv gayak kaa film fere award mila tha
 Mohammad Rafi once said about him, 'you people listen to my songs, but if i am asked, i will say that i only listen to the songs of Manna Dey
 ' Manna Dey wrote her autobiography 'jivoner Jalasaghore' in Bangla
 bharat sarkaar ne unhen 1971 main padmashri, 2005 main padmabhushan se sammanit kiya
 In the year 2004, Ravindra Bharti University awarded him D
 lit
 Awarded an honorary degree of
 sangeet ke kshetra main ullekhneey yogadan ke liye unhen dadasaheb phalke puraskaar se bhi sammanit kiya gaya
 An English documentary titled 'jivoner Jalasaghore' based on Manna Dey's life has been produced by Manna Dey Sangeet Akademi
 mumbai main pachaas saal se zyada samay tak rahane ke baad manna de bengaluru ke kalyaan nagar main ja bas the
 With aging, many diseases also began to bother him
 tippaniyan Manna Dey had to undergo the process of dialysis repeatedly due to kidney disease with shortness of breath
 23 oktober, 2013 ko sharir ke kai angon ne kaam karnaa band kar diya
 4 on the morning of 24 October
 30 baje unhone antim saans lee
 Manna da disappeared from us forever
 shastreey sangeet ko karnpriy banane main manna de kaa koi sani nahin tha
 He became immortal due to his songs
 unke geet sadiyon tak goonjte rahenge or peedi dar peedi log bade chaav se sunenge
 Sahasra Naman on Memorial Day !!! (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) The singer was born on 1 May 1919 in Calcutta (kolkata)
 inaki maa kaa naam mahamaya or pita kaa naam poornachandra de tha
 He graduated from Vidyasagar College after receiving his early education from Indu Baburpur Pathshala
 vah kushti or mukkebaaji kii pratiyogitaaon main bhi khub bhaag lete the
 His father wanted him to be a lawyer
 magar manna ko to adaalat nahin, adaavat pasand thi
 This well-known singer received his early education in music from his uncle Krishna Chandra Dey
 ek baar jab ustad badal khan or manna de ke chachaa saath main riyaj kar rahe the, tabhi bagal ke kamare main balak manna bhi ga rahe the
 Badal Khan asked Krishna Chandra Dey who is singing it, so he called Manna Dey
 vah unki pratibha pahchaan chuke the or tabhi se manna apane chachaa se sangeet kii talim lene lage
 He trained in Hindustani classical music from Ustad Dabir Khan, Ustad Aman Ali Khan and Ustad Abdul Rahman Khan
 manna de 1940 ke dashak main sangeet ke kshetra main apana mukaam banane ke liye apane chachaa ke saath mumbai aa gaye
 There he worked as an assistant music director first with his uncle, then with Sachin Dev Varman
 pashrv gayak ke rup main manna ne pehali baar film 'tamanna' (1942) ke liye suraiya ke saath gaaya
 However, before that he joined the group anthem in the film 'ram Rajya'
 is film ke bare main dilachasp baat yah he ki yahi ekmaatr film thi, jise mahatma gandhi ne dekhi thi
 For the first time as a solo singer, he was given the opportunity to sing the song 'gayi Tu Gaya Sita Sati' from the film 'ram Rajya' (1943) by composer Shankar Rao Vyas
 unhone 'o prem divaani sanbhal ke chalanaa' (kadambari-1944), 'i duniya jaraa (kamala -1946)', 'hai ye he' (jangal kaa jaanavar 1951),' 'pyaar hua ikraar hua (shri 420-1955), 'ye raat bhigi bhigi' (chori-chori-1956) jaise kai geet gaae, lekin 1961 main ai film 'kabuli vaala' ke geet 'i mere pyaare vatan' ne manna de ko shoharat kii bulandiyon par pahunchaa diya
 Manna Dey was fond of singing difficult songs based on classical music
