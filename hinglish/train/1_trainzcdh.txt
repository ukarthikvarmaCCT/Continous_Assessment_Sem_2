 rajya sarkaar ne vidhansabha main rajasthan dharohar sangrakshan vidheyak 2015 pesh karne kaa faisla kiya he, jise purv rajpariwaron or thakuron kii taraf se baari virodh kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 The bill is the brainchild of Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, who herself has been the queen of Dholpur and the princess of Gwalior
 vidheyak main iske tahat ek dharohar praadhikaran or ek dharohar parishad banane kaa prastaav he, jinhen akut adhikaar die gaye hai
 These include acquisition of any heritage property for its maintenance
 vidheyak se prabhavit hone vaale logon ko sabase zyada dhakka is baat se laga he ki vidheyak praadhikaran ko kisi bhi sampatti kaa fouran adhigrahan karne kaa adhikaar detaa he
 As an exception, the bill also provides for two months' notice
 vidheyak smarak ke bheetar kisi bhi tayshuda kaam ke liye mukarrar kiye gaye shakchas ko daakhil hone kii ijaajat detaa he—unhen bas itnaa karnaa hoga ki 24 ghante kaa notice de den
 There are thousands of such private properties in Rajasthan and what is most worrying to the stakeholders is that the Bill does not make any difference between dilapidated assets and well-maintained assets, which leaders and parties with vested interests can potentially misuse
 indian heritage hotels association ke mahasachiv randhir vikram singh kehete hai, ''ham maanate hai ki kuch sampattiyon ko rakh-rakhaav kii jarurat he
 But the Bill does not make any difference in assets that are well taken care of and which need the intervention of the government
 ''vivaadit vidheyak 9 april ko rajya vidhansabha main rakhaa gaya tha or bagaiyr kisi bahes ke ise pravar samiti ko bhej diya gaya
 Rajasthan's Urban Development and Housing Minister Rajpal Singh Shekhawat is the chairman of the committee and includes members like former Maharaj and Congress MLA from Bharatpur, Vishvendra Singh and former princess of Jaipur and BJP MLA Dia Kumari
 1 sitambar ko samiti ne vidheyak se prabhavit hone vaale hitdharakon ke saath baithak kii, jinamein purv shahi gharaanon se jude udaipur ke arvind singh mewar, jodhpur ke gaj singh or mandava ke randhir vikram singh bhi shaamil the
 At the meeting, Vishvendra Singh said, "this is a very cruel law being enacted
" '' aam sahmati yah thi ki vidheyak ko yaa to puri tarah tilanjali de di jaae yaa phir ahm sanshodhan karke puri tarah badal diya jaae
 The former royal houses forced the government to rethink its decision after strong opposition
 sarkaar ab duvidha main he ki vah 16 sitambar ko shuru hone vaale vidhansabha satr main ise sadan main rakhe yaa nahin
 Coming from a royal background himself, Raje is keenly interested in the conservation and development of heritage properties
 2008 main khatm hue unke pichley kaarykaal main unhone amer ke kile kii kayapalat ke liye ek payalat project shuru kiya tha, jisamen use sailaaniyon ke liye zyada anukool banaaya gaya or kile ke kai hisson ko khol diya gaya, jo pehle darshakon kii pahunch se baahar the
 He had also introduced a bill, under which the private sector would have been allowed to adopt state owned monuments, but this bill was opposed from within the government and finally was abandoned
 iske ulat, maujuuda dharohar vidheyak ne rajya kii milkiyat vaali tamaam sampattiyon ko iske daayre se baahar rakhaa he or keval nijee sampattiyon ko shaamil kiya he, jisase aisi sampattiyon ke maalikon ke man main dar baith gaya he ki isse jameen or imaarat par unka malikana haq khatre main pad saktaa he
 Apparently this bill is in contrast to all the efforts of previous governments, including the Raje government, in which they had tried to hand over their heritage properties apart from monuments either by leasing or through public-private partnerships to the private sector
 aisi zyaadaatar koshishen isliye naakaam huin, kyonki inamen niveshkon se sarkaar ko bahut baari rakam adaa karne kii ummid kii gai thi
 Former royal families are demanding that the dilapidated properties be handed over to their previous owners or those running heritage hotels
 yahi vajah he ki maujuuda swaroop main is vidheyak ne sarkaar kii manshaa par gambhir sawaal khadey kar die hai—sarkaar kaa asli makasad dharohar imaaraton kii sachmuch raksha karnaa he yaa vah is vidheyak ko aujaar kii tarah istemaal karke kuch purv shahi gharaanon ko nishaanaa bana rahi he, taaki unki sampattiyon kaa adhigrahan karke unhen korporate jagat ko saunp sake, jisamen kuch purv shahi gharaane bhi shaamil hai
 Affected are complaining that the bill lays greater emphasis on regulatory and acquisition arrangements rather than clarifying the role of the government in helping owners of private heritage properties, for which many laws are already in place
 iske saath hi kanoonee dikkatein bhi hai
 Arvind Singh Mewar explains, "there will be numerous legal ramifications associated with the acquisition of these properties — many generations have held ownership over them and no one will allow them to be acquired easily
" '' is bich diya kumari ne maang kii he ki anubandhit sampattiyon ko vidheyak ke daayre se baahar rakhaa jaae
 The owners of heritage hotels are also upset
 indian heritage hotels association ke adhyaksh jodhpur ke gaj singh kehete hai ki heritage hotel rajya ke paryaton or arthvyavastha main pehle hi acha-khaasaa yogadan kar rahe hai, unhen is vidheyak se baahar rakhaa janaa chahie
 After drafting the bill, Urban Development Minister Shekhawat has asked the owners of the properties not to bother
 unhone yah vaada bhi kiya he ki sarkaar vidheyak par khule dimag se dobaaraa vichaar karegi
 He says, "the owners have raised concerns about possession entitlements; We will see whether to draft the Bill anew or change its sections

 The farmers of the country are being forced to hit the road for agitation for debt waiver
 isi kadi main hajaaron kisaan uttarakhand ke haridwar se chalakar mangalvaar ko dilli-upi ke border par pahunche the to police ne lathi, aansu gas or pani kii bauchhaaron kaa istemaal kar unhen dilli kii sarhad main aane se roka
 After talks with the government and the day-long struggle, hundreds of blood-soaked farmers finally entered Delhi late at night and offered flowers at Chaudhary Charan Singh's tomb and returned after announcing the end of the agitation
 dilli darbar se khaali haath laute kisaanon kii naaraazgi abhi vaise hi kaayam he
 They are protesting against lathi charge in many places in the country
 aakhir kisaan baar-baar dilli tak pradarshan kyon kar rahe hai
 Debt waiver is only one side of his problem
 ajtak ne kisaanon kii pareshaani kii jamini hakeekat jaanane or samajhane ke liye unase baat kii
 What do farmers want? Anees Ahmad, a farmer who came from Bijnor in Kisan Kranti Yatra, says that the government should give a reasonable price for the cost of the crop of the farmers and pay it on time
 pichley 6 maheene se anis ahamed kaa ganne kaa bhugtan nazibabad kshetra kii dwarikesh sugar mil par bakaayaa he
 According to Anees, the rest of the farmers in the same area have not been paid as well
 anis kehete hai ki un par 2 lakh 60 hajaar kaa bank karj he, jis par wo 12 fisadi byaaj de rahe hai
 Due to non-payment of sugarcane, they are unable to pay their bank loan
 wo kehete hai ki hamen karj na chukaa paane kii sthiti main bank ko byaaj dena padataa he
 While we owe millions on the sugar mill, we do not get any interest or bonus on it
 kisaanon ke saath sarkaar kaa ye doharaa ravaiya he
 Costs increased but not income Kuldeep Dahiya, a resident of Jatkhod village in Delhi, says that the Mododi government had announced to double the MSP, but did not tell how much the crop cost had gone up
 maujuuda samay main kheti main laagat kaaphi bad gai he, lekin us hisaab se hamen mulya nahin mil paa rahaa he
 They say that by the time the government starts purchasing crops, the farmers have sold to moneylenders
 krishi kshetra ke alag bajet kyon nahin?dilli ke bavana ilaake ke qutubgarh gaanv ke rahane vaale anand rana kehete hai ki raajnneetik dalon ke agenda se kisaan baahar he, yahi vajah he ki aaj unki koi baat nahin kar rahaa he
 The government talks to industrial houses and corporate people before making the budget, but never takes the opinion of the representatives of the farmers
 jabaki is desh ke 70 fisadi log kisaani par nirbhar hai
 Rana says that the farmer puts as much in his crop that he does not get even half of it
 yahi vajah he ki aaj kisaan karj main duba hua he
 The moneylender owes more to the farmers than the bank
 saharanpur ke dikka kala gaanv ke rahane vaale abdus salaam 80 bighas ke kastkaar hai
 His family's expenses come from farming itself

 No payment has been made since February
 aise main ghar chalaanaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 Recently, i took a loan and got my son treated
 kisaan kaise paale parivaar?wo kehete hai ki mahangaai din dooni raat bad rahi he, lekin hamaari fasal vahi puraane mulya par bik rahi he
 Whereas for agriculture, DAP to urea and seeds are getting expensive today
 kheti main jitani laagat aa rahi he, wo nikal bhi nahin paa rahaa he
 While our entire family is engaged in farming
 saharanpur ambetha ke rahane vaale gulzaar kuraishi kehete hai ki modi sarkaar ne kisaanon se jude saamaanon par jiesti nahin lagane kaa vaada kiya tha
 But today we have to pay 28% GST on tractors
 iske alaava tubewel ke bijli conection par rajya sarkaar hamase 29 hajaar rupee salanaa le rahi he
 Whereas we use Tubel for just under two months
 iske baavjood puure saal sarkaar ko bijli kaa bill dena padataa he
 Troubled by the order of the NGT, Daleel Singh, a resident of Mungeshpur village in Delhi, says that the NGT has banned ten year old tractors in NCR
 kheti karke ham pehle se hi karj main duube hai aise main ham har das saal par kaise nayaa tractor kharidenge
 Apart from this, if you buy a tractor with a loan from the bank, then you have to pay 12 percent interest
 bijli ke bill bhi paidaa kar rahe hai dikkatadaryapur kala gaanv ke rahane vaale vinod sheravat kehete hai ki dilli main sinchai ke liye koi vaikalpik vyavastha nahin he
 Tubel has only support for farming
 dilli main genhu kii kheti kii sinchai ke liye mahaj chaar maheene tubel kaa istemaal karte hai
 The rest of the time our tubel is closed
 is saal april se pehle tak hamen 25 rupee prati kilawat ke hisaab se dena padataa tha
 In this regard, our bill used to be 125 rupees
 lekin bijli companiyon ne ab badhaakar ise 125 rupee prati kilowat kar diya is lihaaj se kareeb 625 rupee bill aata hai or tex milakar kareeb 700 rupee prati maheenaa dena pad rahaa he
 Whereas agriculture used to cost about 10 thousand rupees in a year, now it is also not being done

 When Swadeshi Jagran Manch started advising the Reserve Bank of India what to do, it means that Ease of Doing has become really good in India
 notebandi ke samay noton kii ginati main jo lanbaa vakt laga, reserve bank ne saamaanya report main notebandi par do chaar line likh di, tab kisi ko nahin laga ki urjit patel ko istipha de dena chahie
 Even then the Reserve Bank did not feel that the government was interfering
 uski swaittata par hamalaa ho rahaa he
 Everyone seemed to have earned Patel, Urjit Patel
 ab urjit patel kaa istipha bhi maanga ja rahaa he or unke bhi istipha dene kii khabar aa rahi he
 There should be a balance between the government and the Reserve Bank of India, but why this balance still seems to be swinging
 kyon swadeshi jaagran ko bhi lagata he ki governor urjit patel apane afasaron ko saarvajinak rup se matbhedon ko ujagar karne se roke yaa phir pad chhod den
 What would have happened if some other organization had commented on the CBI like this organization of national volunteer
 tab vah kise pad chhodane ke liye kahati
 Why Swadeshi Jagran has suddenly started awakening about the Reserve Bank, what Swadeshi has shown in the activities of the Reserve Bank, you should hear from Ashwani Mahajan
 swadeshi jaagran manch ke hi es gurumurti ko lekar vivaad kii khabar ai thi, jisase gurumurti ne inkaar kiya tha
 Gurumurthy is a part-time director of the Reserve Bank
 unhone kaha ki board kii baithak main maujuud the
 It discussed 5 issues and agreed on four
 sirf ek mudde ko lekar lekin koi dabaav nahin daalaa gaya
 In this context, the talk of Swadeshi Jagran Manch to Urjit Patel and resignation becomes important
 kya swadeshi jaagran manch ne tab kuch kaha tha, jab raghuram rajan ne pradhanmantri karyaalay or vitt mantralay ko kuch pramukh baqaayadaaron kii suchi di thi ki inaki jaanch ho, ye lone chukaane main gadabadi kar rahe hai
 We do not know what s Gurumurthy has done or is going to do about the Swadeshi Jagran Manch and the Reserve Bank
 lekin di vir ke dhiraj mishra kii report he ki reserve bank ne soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat is jaankaree kii pushti kii he ki rajan ne apana patr 4 farvari 2015 ko pradhanmantri karyaalay ko bhej diya tha
 The letter contained a list of the defaulters against whom Rajan wanted to investigate
 6 sitambar ko rajan ne 17 pannon kaa ek note sansad kii samiti ko saunpa tha
 Had told why the banks of India have a problem with non-performing assets and how big it is
 ab pradhanmantri karyaalay hi bataae ki us list ko lekar kya karrwai hui
 The Wire had asked the Prime Minister's Office that Rajan's letter does not come under the RTI
 kya aapako yahi ajeeb nahin lagata ki ek hi sawaal pradhanmantri karyaalay se poocha gaya or vahi sawaal bhartiya reserve bank se poocha gaya magar reserve bank ne jawaab diya or pradhanmantri karyaalay ne jawaab hi nahin diya
 Is everything okay, all right

 agrezi media main sarkaar or reserve bank ko lekar kaaphi kuch likhaa ja rahaa he
 Finance Minister Jaitley had said that elected leaders are accountable and not regulators

 Will the public punish them for this? kehane kaa matlab he ki yah sab mudda hi kab hota he
 Sunil Jain also wrote that during the ten years of UPA 1 and 2, the share value of all psus decreased by 6 lakh crores, but within five years of the Modi government, there was a loss of 11 lakh crores
 aapane kab suna he ki janata kaa paisa nasht karne ke liye log sarkaar ko doshi tehra rahe hon
 Therefore, elected representatives cannot have any special intervention in this matter

 bloomberg website kii ira duggnal ne likhaa he ki 26 aktubar ko dipti governor viral acharya ke fat padane se pehle march, april or 12 aktubar ko governor urjit patel or unke do do dipti public main bol chuke hai
 Which gives a clear indication that the Reserve Bank is fighting for its autonomy
 28 akbutar ke apni report main ira duggal ne bataaya he ki jab punjab neshnal bank kaa ghotaalaa saamne aayaa, tab vitt mantri jetali ne bina naam liye kaha tha ki itnaa bada ghotaalaa auditor or regulator kii nazar se kaise chook gaya
 Governor Urjit Patel gave a very strong answer to this in his speech of Gujarat Law University
 unhone kaha tha ki sarkari bainkon par niyantran ke liye reserve bank ko or adhikaar chahie
 His authority is very limited
 urjit patel ne kaha tha ki reserve bank nideshak ko nahin hataa saktaa he, prabandhan ko nahin badal saktaa he, vilay ke liye baadhya nahin kar saktaa he
 While the Reserve Bank of India regulates all banks, government banks are regulated by the government, as they are the major shareholders of these banks
 is tarah se bainkon par doharaa niyantran he
 In a way, Urjit Patel had put the responsibility of the Punjab National Bank scam in the government's court, while the government wanted to blame the Reserve Bank
 12 farvari ko ek circular jari hua ki bank agar bade karzdaaron se lone kii vaapasi main ek din kii bhi deree ho to use note karen or diwalia ghoshit karne kii prakriya shuru kar den
 This new circular increased the risk of bankruptcy of large power plants
 bank vaale sarkaar ke paas gaye or sarkaar arabiai ke paas
 But the RBI did not change its stand
 arabiai ne july or agast ke maheene main public main apane is circular kaa bachaav kiya
 The bankers later moved to court and from there on 12 September got relief
 court main arabiai ne kaha ki agar sarkaar circular main badlaav chaahati thi to vah arabiai se kah sakati thi
 Earlier in April, while speaking at Pune's National Institute of Banking, Deputy Governor NS Vishwanathan's statement was reported by Hindu Business Line and Economic Times
 jisaki heading he ki rigerv bank ne apana dam dikhaaya, ummid he dam barkaar rahegaa
 Deputy Governor Vishwanathan had said that the correct valuation of banks' loans is also suits the banks and suits the government as well as those who do not repay the loans
 bank apana bahikhaata saaf suthra kar lete hai or bakaayedaar difolter kaa tag lagane se batch jate hai
 Recall that this is what the Finance Minister is saying that the Reserve Bank did not evaluate the NPA correctly, while the Deputy Governor has said that the work was done by the bank and the government, which he did not say
 vishvanathan ne saaf-saaf kaha tha ki bank badalane ke liye taiyaar nahin ho rahe hai
 In the Times of India on October 13, Deputy Governor Viral Acharya said at IIT Bombay that curbing banks had affected bad loans and saved banks from deteriorating
 isliye iskaa jari rahanaa bahut zaruri he
 The Reserve Bank had imposed PCA i
e
 'prompt Corrective Action' on 11 such banks, which had a large portion of their loans becoming npas
 viral acharya ne yah bhaashan 12 aktubar ko diya tha
 The comments sarkaar kaa dabaav rahaa he ki bainkon se yah ankush lage or unhen or adhik lone dene kii chhot mili
 So you saw that the Reserve Bank of India is constantly talking about its autonomy among the public, and is talking about giving more powers, but everyone got noticed when on October 26, Deputy Acharya spoke in public that the central bank Weakening autonomy can be disastrous
 baad main sarkaar ko bayaan jari karnaa padaa ki arabiai kii swytta jaruri he or vah sammaan karti he
 But Reserve Bank officials should not speak in public
 sarkaar ne ab kaha, jabaki march ke maheene se rigerv bank ke governor public ko ishaara kar rahe the ki anaavashyak dabaav pad rahaa he
 After all, the government has never given orders under section seven since the Reserve Bank came into existence, but why has it come to light now
 is section ke tahat sarkaar rigerv bank ko aadesh de sakati he ki kya karnaa he
 After all, why did this conflict between the Reserve Bank and the government, why the government wants banks to be given lending, while the condition of the banks is poor due to non-repayment of loans
 kya sarkaar kinhi khaas corporate gharaanon ke liye yah sab chaahati he, pataa nahin, kya sarkaar vaaki chaahati he ki bazaar main karz kii raashi uplabdh ho, to phir vah kyon nahin chaahati ki pehle 10 lakh karod ke enpie waapas hon
 There is also a question whether there is no money to lend in the market
 sarkaar or bhartiya reserve bank ke bich santulan hona chahie, magar yah santulan abhi kyon dolata nazar aa rahaa he
 Why Swadeshi Jagran also feels that Governor Urjit Patel should stop his officers from publicly exposing the differences or leave the post
 rashtriya swayan sevak ke is saganthan kii tarah agar kisi anya sanghathan ne sibiai par tippanee kar di hoti to kya hota

 He was present at the board meeting

 But there was no pressure on just one issue
 is sandarbh main swadeshi jaagran manch kaa urjit patel ko salaah or istife kii baat mahatvapurn ho jaati he
 Did the Swadeshi Jagran Manch say anything when Raghuram Rajan gave the Prime Minister's Office and the Finance Ministry a list of some key defaulters that they should be investigated, they are making a mess in repaying the loan
 hamen nahin pataa ki ise lekar swadeshi jaagran manch or rigerv bank main es gurumurti ne kya kiya he yaa kya karne ja rahe hai
 But Dheeraj Mishra of The Wire reports that the Reserve Bank has confirmed the information under the RTI that Rajan had sent his letter to the Prime Minister's Office on 4 February 2015
 is patr main un baqaayadaaron kii suchi thi, jinke khilaaf rajan jaanch chaahate the
 On 6 September, Rajan submitted a 17-page note to the Committee of Parliament

 Now the Prime Minister's Office should tell what action was taken on that list
 di vir ne yahi jawaab pradhanmantri karyaalay se poocha tha ki rajan kaa patr soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat nahin aata he
 Don't you find it strange that the same question was asked from the Prime Minister's Office and the same question was asked from the Reserve Bank of India but the Reserve Bank responded and the Prime Minister's Office did not respond
 kya sab kuch thik he, bilkul thik he
 Only then one did not answer, even then the other got an answer

 Ira Dugganal of the Bloomberg website wrote that Governor Urjit Patel and two of his two deputies had spoken in public on March 26, April and October 12, before Deputy Governor Viral Acharya burst on 26 October
 jisase saaf-saaf ishaara miltaa he ki rigerv bank apni swytta ke liye sangharsh kar rahaa he
 In his report of 28 Akbutar, Ira Duggal has told that when the Punjab National Bank scam came to light, Finance Minister Jaitley had said without naming how such a big scam missed the eyes of the auditor and regulator
 iskaa bada hi kadaa jawaab governor urjit patel ne gujarat lau uniwarsity ke apane bhaashan main diya tha
 He said that the Reserve Bank needed more powers to control public sector banks
 uske adhikaar bahut simit he
 Urjit Patel had said that the Reserve Bank cannot remove the director, change the management, force the merger
 bhartiya reserve bank jahaan sabhi bainkon kaa niyaman karata he, sarkari bainkon kaa niyaman sarkaar karti he, kyonki vahi in bainkon kii badi hissedaar he
 In this way banks have double control
 ek tarah se urjit patel ne punjab neshnal bank ghotaale kii zimmedaari sarkaar ke paale main daal di thi, jabaki sarkaar rigerv bank par dosha daalana chaahati thi
 On February 12, a circular was issued that if banks were to delay the repayment of loan from big borrowers by a day, then note it and start the process of declaring bankruptcy
 is nae circular se bade power plant ke diwalia hone kaa khatra bad gaya
 The bankers went to the government and the government to the RBI
 magar arabiai ne apane rukh main badlaav nahin kiya
 RBI defended this circular in public in the months of July and August
 baad main banker court chale gaye or vahaan se 12 sitambar ko raahat mil gai
 In the court, the RBI said that if the government wanted a change in the circular, it could have told the RBI
 iske pehle april main pune ke neshnal institute of banking main bolte hue dipti governor enes vishvanathan ke bayaan ko hindu bijness line or iconomik times ne report kiya tha
 The head of which is that the Reserve Bank has shown its strength, hopefully it will remain the same
 dipti governor vishvanathan ne kaha tha ki bainkon ke lone kaa sahi moolyankan bainkon ko bhi suut kar rahaa he or sarkaar ko bhi suut kar rahaa he or lone lekar nahin chukaane waalon ko bhi suut kar rahaa he
 Banks make their bookkeeping neat and avoid getting tagged with defaulters defaulters
 yaad kiijie yahi baat vitt mantri kah rahe hai ki rigerv bank ne enpie kaa sahi moolyankan nahin kiya, jabaki dipti governor kah chuke hai ki yah kaam to bank or sarkaar kaa tha jo unhone nahin kaha
 Vishwanathan had clearly stated that banks are not ready to change
 13 aktubar ke times of india main dipti governor viral acharya ne iaiti bambe main kaha ki bainkon par ankush lagane se bure lone par asar padaa he or bainkon kii haalat bigadane se bachi he
 Therefore, it is very important to continue this
 reserve bank ne 11 aise bainkon par pisie yani 'pramt karactive ection' laga diya tha, jinke lone kaa bada hissaa enpie ho gaya tha
 Viral Acharya gave this speech on 12 October
 tippaniyan There has been pressure from the government to curb this from banks and allow them to give more loans
 to aapane dekha ki bhartiya reserve bank lagaataar janata ke bich apni swytta kii baat kar rahaa he, or adhik adhikaar die jane kii baat kar rahaa he, lekin sabakaa dhyaan tab gaya jab 26 aktubar ko dipti acharya ne public main bol diya ki kendriya bank kii swytta ko kamazor karnaa vinaashkari ho saktaa he
 Later the government had to issue a statement that rbi's autonomy is necessary and it is respected
 lekin rigerv bank ke adhikari public main baat na kahen
 The government now said, while the Governor of the Reserve Bank had been pointing to the public since the month of March that there was unnecessary pressure
 aakhir rigerv bank ke astitv main aane ke baad se aaj tak sarkaar ne kabhi section saat ke tahat aadesh nahin diya, magar ab yah naubat kyon ai he
 Under this section, the government can order the Reserve Bank what to do
 aakhir rigerv bank or sararkaar ke bich yah tanatani kyon hui, kyon sarkaar chaahati he ki bainkon ko karj dene kii chhot mili, jabaki karj kii vaapasi nahin hone ke kaaran bainkon kii haalat khasta he
 Does the government want all this for certain corporate houses, i do not know, does the government really want that the loan amount is available in the market, then why does it not want the npas of 10 lakh crores to be refunded first
 ek sawaal yah bhi he ki kya bazaar main lone dene ke liye paise nahin hai

 reserve bank ne 11 aise bainkon par pisie yani 'pramt karactive ection' laga diya tha, jinke lone kaa bada hissaa enpie ho gaya tha
 Viral Acharya gave this speech on 12 October
 tippaniyan There has been pressure from the government to curb this from banks and allow them to give more loans
 to aapane dekha ki bhartiya reserve bank lagaataar janata ke bich apni swytta kii baat kar rahaa he, or adhik adhikaar die jane kii baat kar rahaa he, lekin sabakaa dhyaan tab gaya jab 26 aktubar ko dipti acharya ne public main bol diya ki kendriya bank kii swytta ko kamazor karnaa vinaashkari ho saktaa he
 Later the government had to issue a statement that rbi's autonomy is necessary and it is respected
 lekin rigerv bank ke adhikari public main baat na kahen
 The government now said, while the Governor of the Reserve Bank had been pointing to the public since the month of March that there was unnecessary pressure
 aakhir rigerv bank ke astitv main aane ke baad se aaj tak sarkaar ne kabhi section saat ke tahat aadesh nahin diya, magar ab yah naubat kyon ai he
 Under this section, the government can order the Reserve Bank what to do
 aakhir rigerv bank or sararkaar ke bich yah tanatani kyon hui, kyon sarkaar chaahati he ki bainkon ko karj dene kii chhot mili, jabaki karj kii vaapasi nahin hone ke kaaran bainkon kii haalat khasta he
 Does the government want all this for certain corporate houses, i do not know, does the government really want that the loan amount is available in the market, then why does it not want the npas of 10 lakh crores to be refunded first
 ek sawaal yah bhi he ki kya bazaar main lone dene ke liye paise nahin hai
 Now the Prime Minister's Office should tell what action was taken on that list
 di vir ne yahi jawaab pradhanmantri karyaalay se poocha tha ki rajan kaa patr soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat nahin aata he
 Don't you find it strange that the same question was asked from the Prime Minister's Office and the same question was asked from the Reserve Bank of India but the Reserve Bank responded and the Prime Minister's Office did not respond
 kya sab kuch thik he, bilkul thik he
 Only then one did not answer, even then the other got an answer
 taaliyaan
 Much is being written about the government and the Reserve Bank in the English media
 vitt mantri jetali ne kaha tha ki chune hue netaaon kii javabdehi hoti he, regulator kii nahin

 sunil jain ne yah bhi likhaa he ki upie 1 or 2 ke das saal ke dauraan sabhi piesu kaa share vailu 6 lakh karod kam ho gaya, lekin modi sarkaar ke paanch saal ke bheetar hi 11 lakh karod kaa nuksaan ho gaya

 Does the government want all this for certain corporate houses, i do not know, does the government really want that the loan amount is available in the market, then why does it not want the npas of 10 lakh crores to be refunded first
 ek sawaal yah bhi he ki kya bazaar main lone dene ke liye paise nahin hai
 Earlier in April, while speaking at Pune's National Institute of Banking, Deputy Governor NS Vishwanathan's statement was reported by Hindu Business Line and Economic Times
 jisaki heading he ki rigerv bank ne apana dam dikhaaya, ummid he dam barkaar rahegaa
 Deputy Governor Vishwanathan had said that the correct valuation of banks' loans is also suits the banks and suits the government as well as those who do not repay the loans
 bank apana bahikhaata saaf suthra kar lete hai or bakaayedaar difolter kaa tag lagane se batch jate hai
 Recall that this is what the Finance Minister is saying that the Reserve Bank did not evaluate the NPA correctly, while the Deputy Governor has said that the work was done by the bank and the government, which he did not say
 vishvanathan ne saaf-saaf kaha tha ki bank badalane ke liye taiyaar nahin ho rahe hai
 In the Times of India on October 13, Deputy Governor Viral Acharya said at IIT Bombay that curbing banks had affected bad loans and saved banks from deteriorating
 isliye iskaa jari rahanaa bahut zaruri he
 The Reserve Bank had imposed PCA i
e
 'prompt Corrective Action' on 11 such banks, which had a large portion of their loans becoming npas
 viral acharya ne yah bhaashan 12 aktubar ko diya tha
 The comments sarkaar kaa dabaav rahaa he ki bainkon se yah ankush lage or unhen or adhik lone dene kii chhot mili
 So you saw that the Reserve Bank of India is constantly talking about its autonomy among the public, and is talking about giving more powers, but everyone got noticed when on October 26, Deputy Acharya spoke in public that the central bank Weakening autonomy can be disastrous
 baad main sarkaar ko bayaan jari karnaa padaa ki arabiai kii swytta jaruri he or vah sammaan karti he
 But Reserve Bank officials should not speak in public
 sarkaar ne ab kaha, jabaki march ke maheene se rigerv bank ke governor public ko ishaara kar rahe the ki anaavashyak dabaav pad rahaa he
 After all, the government has never given orders under section seven since the Reserve Bank came into existence, but why has it come to light now
 is section ke tahat sarkaar rigerv bank ko aadesh de sakati he ki kya karnaa he
 After all, why did this conflict between the Reserve Bank and the government, why the government wants banks to be given lending, while the condition of the banks is poor due to non-repayment of loans
 kya sarkaar kinhi khaas corporate gharaanon ke liye yah sab chaahati he, pataa nahin, kya sarkaar vaaki chaahati he ki bazaar main karz kii raashi uplabdh ho, to phir vah kyon nahin chaahati ki pehle 10 lakh karod ke enpie waapas hon
 There is also a question whether there is no money to lend in the market
 yaad kiijie yahi baat vitt mantri kah rahe hai ki rigerv bank ne enpie kaa sahi moolyankan nahin kiya, jabaki dipti governor kah chuke hai ki yah kaam to bank or sarkaar kaa tha jo unhone nahin kaha
 Vishwanathan had clearly stated that banks are not ready to change
 13 aktubar ke times of india main dipti governor viral acharya ne iaiti bambe main kaha ki bainkon par ankush lagane se bure lone par asar padaa he or bainkon kii haalat bigadane se bachi he
 Therefore, it is very important to continue this
 reserve bank ne 11 aise bainkon par pisie yani 'pramt karactive ection' laga diya tha, jinke lone kaa bada hissaa enpie ho gaya tha

 to aapane dekha ki bhartiya reserve bank lagaataar janata ke bich apni swytta kii baat kar rahaa he, or adhik adhikaar die jane kii baat kar rahaa he, lekin sabakaa dhyaan tab gaya jab 26 aktubar ko dipti acharya ne public main bol diya ki kendriya bank kii swytta ko kamazor karnaa vinaashkari ho saktaa he
 Later the government had to issue a statement that rbi's autonomy is necessary and it is respected
 lekin rigerv bank ke adhikari public main baat na kahen
 The government now said, while the Governor of the Reserve Bank had been pointing to the public since the month of March that there was unnecessary pressure
 aakhir rigerv bank ke astitv main aane ke baad se aaj tak sarkaar ne kabhi section saat ke tahat aadesh nahin diya, magar ab yah naubat kyon ai he
 Under this section, the government can order the Reserve Bank what to do
 aakhir rigerv bank or sararkaar ke bich yah tanatani kyon hui, kyon sarkaar chaahati he ki bainkon ko karj dene kii chhot mili, jabaki karj kii vaapasi nahin hone ke kaaran bainkon kii haalat khasta he
 Does the government want all this for certain corporate houses, i do not know, does the government really want that the loan amount is available in the market, then why does it not want the npas of 10 lakh crores to be refunded first
 ek sawaal yah bhi he ki kya bazaar main lone dene ke liye paise nahin hai
 There has been pressure from the government to curb this from banks and allow them to give more loans

 ek sawaal yah bhi he ki kya bazaar main lone dene ke liye paise nahin hai
 After all, the government has never given orders under section seven since the Reserve Bank came into existence, but why has it come to light now
 is section ke tahat sarkaar rigerv bank ko aadesh de sakati he ki kya karnaa he
 After all, why did this conflict between the Reserve Bank and the government, why the government wants banks to be given lending, while the condition of the banks is poor due to non-repayment of loans
 kya sarkaar kinhi khaas corporate gharaanon ke liye yah sab chaahati he, pataa nahin, kya sarkaar vaaki chaahati he ki bazaar main karz kii raashi uplabdh ho, to phir vah kyon nahin chaahati ki pehle 10 lakh karod ke enpie waapas hon
 There is also a question whether there is no money to lend in the market

 madhya pradesh vidhansabha chunaav ke tahat voting se teen din pehle aresas or vishwa hindu parishad desh ke teen shaharon main ram mandir ko lekar janaagrah raily kaa aayojan karne ja rahe hai
 In the rally of the sangh-vhp, there seems to be a conspiracy to polarize the Congress votes
 ram mandir ko lekar aresas or viechpi 25 november ko ayodhya, nagpur or bengaluru main janaagrah raily kaa aayojan karegaa
 Thousands of saints and saints of the country are expected to participate in this program of the sangh-vhp
 aise main iske siyaasi myne bhi nikaale jane lage hai
 Congress leader and former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijay Singh said in an interview to an English newspaper that the Sangh is holding a rally in Ayodhya on 25 November
 jabaki 28 november ko madhya pradesh main matdaan he
 In such a situation, all news channels will run this rally of the sangh-vhp for 24 hours
 madhya pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri ne kaha ki matdaan se teen din pehle ram mandir mudde ko logon ke saamne laane kii koshish he
 The intention is to polarize through this
 dilachasp baat ye he ki ram mandir mudde ko lekar siyasat tej ho gai he
 The picture on the Ayodhya case will be heard in the Supreme Court from now on
 ise lekar sadhu-santon ke tevar sakht hai
 Amidst all this the Sangh and VHP are going to rally where the Janaagraha is
 vahiin, shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare bhi 25 november ko ayodhya pahunch rahe hai
 The editorial of the Sena mouthpiece Saamana reads, 'the most important is who has set the dates for the rss's Janagraha rally
 jisane aresas se kaha he 25 november ko janaagrah raily kaa aayojan kiya jaae, uske naam kaa khulaasa kiya janaa chahie
 The Shiv Sena had decided to schedule its program in Ayodhya on 25 November at the very first Dussehra rally
 aresas ne usee din janaagrah raily rakhane kaa faisla kyon kiya? aresas ne iske bare main pehle kyon nahin sochaa?’shivasena pehle bhi kah chuki he ki bijepi sarkaar bahut pehle hi ram mandir kaa nirmaan kara sakati thi, lekin wo sirf chunaav main hi is mudde kaa naam lete hai
 That too just for the name
 shivasena ke mutabik bijepi ram mandir nirmaan ke liye gambhir nahin he
 In fact, the RSS and VHP will rally in Ayodhya on the same day, when the Shiv Sena also has a program there, then the Shiv Sena program will not get much attention

 rashtriya lok samta party (RLSP) ke adhyaksh upendra kushvahalambe samay se 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav par seat bantwaare ko lekar sammanjanak seat die jane kii baat karte rahe hai, or aisa nahin hone par NDA kaa daaman chhodane kaa ishaara bhi kai baar kar chuke hai
 According to sources, Kushwaha wants the BJP to give him 3 seats for the Lok Sabha elections, but the BJP is in a mood to give him only 2 seats, which he is very angry about
 upendra kushvaahaki party araspi ko NDA 2 seat de rahi thi, lekin baad main kushvaha ke bayanon se chidh kar bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah or pradhanmantri narendra modi ne milane kaa samay tak nahin diya
 Amit Shah did not give time
 In the last days, Kushwaha tried his best to negotiate seats with Amit Shah but he did not get time from BJP President
 isi baat se naaraaz hokar pichley maheene kushvaha ne elaan kar diya ki vah 30 november tak siton ke talmail ko lekar baatcheet ke liye taiyaar hai
 He had also placed a condition with this, that now he will not talk with Amit Shah but with Prime Minister Modi as well as the seat coordination
 unki ore se yah ultimatum bhi ab khatm ho chukaa he
 Before the Bihar BJP jdu's b team, Kushwaha once again targeted Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and said that the boat on which he will board is sure to sink
 araspi ke rashtriya adhyaksh kushvaha ne kaha ki aaj se unki party vartmaan bihar sarkaar ko ukhaad phenkane kaa kaam karegi
 Kushwaha also attacked the Bihar BJP separately and said that the leaders of Bihar BJP did not even before and still do not want Narendra Modi to become the Prime Minister

 West Indies star Batsman Marlon Samuels, who won the 'man of the Match' title in the World T20 final, has dedicated this award to Australian cricketer Shane Warne
 aapako jaan kar hairaani hogi ki unhone aisa warn ke sammaan main nahin balki unase ranjish kii vajah se kiya he

 world tii20 kaa final jeetne ke baad sampuls ne kaha, ‘shen jis tarah se mere bare main baat karata he or jo chijen karata he main uski saraahna nahin karata
 The Samuels vs Warnsamuels and Warne feud came back in the semi-final against India when Warne made some comments in the commentary box after the West Indies player was dismissed

 ’hamane dhairya banaae rakhabreowate ke antim over main lagaataar chaar chakke ke sandarbh main sampuls ne kaha ki dhairya banaae rakhana ahm tha
 He said, 'I don't think i need to say more words to tell about it

 hamen ek duusare par vishwaas he
 When the next player goes to bat, we are confident that he will work for us
 ham dhairya barkaraar rakhte hai
 The most important thing is that we are not afraid in any situation
 ’sampuls kaa juuta vivadais dauraan sampuls ek or vivaad main pad gaye
 Samuels, while replying to reporters at the post-match press conference, put his feet on the table, wearing a pad, and spoke in a similar manner despite icc's urge to lower his legs
 sambhaavna he ki sampuls par iske liye isisi karrwai kare

 is baatcheet ke dauraan unhone kaha ki maine sirf isliye istipha diya kyonki sarkaar loktantr main logon ko unke moulik adhikaar se vanchit kar rahi he
 The decision taken by the government in Kashmir is right or wrong may be a matter of dispute but the people of Kashmir have the right to react to this decision of the government
 lekin sarkaar unhen aisa nahin karne di rahi he
 i am against it
 kannan ne kaha ki ye samvedansheeltaa kashmir mudde se zyada abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ko lekar he

 So i felt that it should not be right to raise voice and do it while in service, so i have done it to express my opinion

 In this meeting, there was talk of forming an alliance of non-nda and non-rjd parties in the upcoming assembly elections
 yahi vajah rahi ki maanjhi se mulaakaat main pappu yadav ne prastaavit gathbandhan main kanhaiya kumaar ko shaamil karne ko lekar bhi baatcheet kii
 Pappu Yadav said that along with people like Manjhi and Kanhaiya, there will be a possibility of better option in Bihar
 yahi nahin pappu yadav ne maanjhi ko tisare morche ke netritv karne kaa ofer bhi de diya he
 Apart from this, they are also trying to bring Congress together

 Bhopal gas tragedy will be discussed in Lok Sabha on Tuesday

 The BJP was earlier pressurizing the issue to be discussed under Rule-184 dividing the issue, but if the government does not agree to it, it will now be a special debate under Rule 193 which does not have a provision for voting after discussion

 ipel main spot phixing maamle main jail kii hawa kha rahe srisanth ek aise vicitra shaks hai jinke liye khabaron main aana koi nai baat nahin he
 Sreesanth, who started his international career against Sri Lanka in the year 2005, had already shown that he was going to give a lot of spice to journalists before he threw his first ball
 gendbaaji ke samay ekadam sadha hua ran-ap or swing par unka behtareen niyantran to logon ne baad main dekha, lekin gendbaaji mark par pahunchane se pehle apni mutthiyaan bheenchakar khud ko utsahit karnaa or phir donon haathon se ishaare karke khud ko apni bhaawanaaon par niyantran karne ke liye kahana, is tarah kii harakatein bhartiya cricket main to pehle kam hi dekhi gayi thim
 Many believe that Sreesanth accidentally got into cricket, he should have been in films
 ek tivi sho main unka dance dekhakar shaayad marhoom maaikel jackson ko bhi unase jalan hone lagati
 Although Kerala newspapers have claimed many times that Sreesanth will soon be seen acting in a Malayalam film, but now perhaps it is not possible due to lack of time
 yadi ho jaataa to shaayad ab unhen ek vaikalpik vyavsaay kaa badhiya vikalp mil jaataa
 a film named 'shree 420' could have been made in his name! For the information, let us tell that her sister is a television actress in Kerala and brother-in-law is a very famous singer
 to yaheen se samaj sakate hai ki tivi par kisi kaarykram ke dauraan srisanth itnaa sahaj kyon mahasoos karte hai
 Despite such a colorful image, the controversies with Sreesanth are sticking around like flop films with Ram Gopal Varma
 kabhi ve harbhajan singh se thappad khaane kaa daawa karte hue tivi par bacchon kii tareh bilakhte hue dikhaai padate hai, to kuch hi saptaah ke baad bhajji se galabahiyaan daalate hue unhen apana bada bhai kehete hai
 The extent is reached when after some years he says that Bhajji had just hit him with an elbow, not a slap! Poor Harbhajan was made such a national villain, from above his own career was also ruined
 ye to vahi baat hui- ham to doobenge sanam, tumko bhi le doobenge
 To avoid his sinking career, he changed his name from Sreesanth to Sreesunth in 2006
 aksar film sitare aisa karte hai, to shri ne bhi vahi rasta pakadaa
 After that, how much flight his career has caught, it is well known; But now, in the kind of circumstances, they are trapped, it seems that they really need a baba! vaishvik str par takanic kii awwal companiyon main se ek APPLE ke saath kaam karnaa aapke liye sapane kaa sach hone jaisaa ho saktaa he

 a week later, on October 17, Kejriwal was targeted by BJP national president Nitin Gadkari
 unka uddeshy saaf tha-maujuuda mukhyadhara kii rajnatik partiyon ke khokhalepan ko ujagar karo or dikhaao ki aakhir kyon sirf unheen kii party rajnatik vikalp de sakati he
 Kejriwal roars, "together they are fooling the public
 ’’ lekin gadakari se jude khulaase main wadra vaali dhar nahin thi, kyonki desh ab naam lekar logon ko sharmasaar karne kii ranneeti se waakif ho chalaa he
 This method is not necessarily effective every time
 philhal siyasat garm he or kejariwal ne bijepi ko bachaav kii mudra main laa diya he
 Sushma Swaraj held a press conference to defend Gadkari just minutes after her story of a rich leader making a profit at the cost of poor farmers was made public
 thik usee tarah jaise wadra ko bachaane ke liye congress ke varisht netaaon ne morcha sambhaal liya tha
 Today, there is only one question among the leaders: who next? It is necessary for Kejriwal to build his political fortress and destroy the existing organs of the establishment
 unki nidarta ne ashok khemka jaise iees afasaron ko sarkaar main maujuud sadaandh ko saamne laane kii himmat di
 In his press conference, Kejriwal also called for other bureaucrats to join his campaign
 unke saathi prashanth bhushan ne press conference main kaha, ‘‘netaa jaanate hai ki hamen chup karaane kaa koi tarika nahin he
 We can't even be bought

 Anna Hazare taught us that one of the five principles of public life is that you should have the power to drink insults

 'this former officer of the Indian Revenue Service is neither like the traditional speakers, nor does he have the moral strength like Hazare
 uskaa saamaanya vyaktitv hi use asaamaanya banaata he
 As Team Kejriwal's undisclosed theorist and political theologian Yogendra Yadav says, "kejriwal's energy lies in solving complexities, mixing with common people, and his honesty
" ’’yah urja vishuddh eemaandaaree, drudh aatmavishvaas or majboot dharanaon se aati he
 Kejriwal has shown the glow of all these qualities even before

 During his studies at IIT Kharagpur, Tata Steel refused to give him placements
 unhone tab company ke chairman ke daftar main phone karke dobaaraa intervyuu karaane kaa dabaav banaaya
 The fruits of his resolve got rewarded and the job was handed over

 For this he received the Magsaysay Award in 2006
 july ke aakhri hafte main jab kejariwal ne hajaare se alag hokar apni netritv kshamta kaa parichay dene kaa faisla kiya to ve darasal aisa karke sarkari bhrashtachar or susti ke khilaaf das saal se zyada puraane ek abhiyaan ko majbootee de rahe the
 This is when Hazare did not know much about India Against Corruption
 unhone 25 july ko hajaare kaa virodh pradarshan kaa pasandida tarika chunaa
 Janlokpal adopted the method of fast unto death for the bill and through it also proved his leadership ability
 kejariwal ko pehali kamyaabi wadra ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke maamle ujagar karne se mili
 This was a turning point for him, as Hazare and Team Anna's core members Kiran Bedi and Santosh Hegde left him in protest against his decision to form a political party
 ve nijee baatcheet main unhen ‘‘sanak’’ kaa shikaar bataa rahe the
 Hazare, Bedi and Hegde wanted this nationwide movement to remain apolitical and work on the agenda of the right to reject the Jan Lokpal and the candidates

 Team Anna's breakup was not cordial
 bedi kahati hai, ‘‘meri daleel thi ki yah rashtriya andolan he jo logon ko jod rahaa he
 Why go towards something that divides us? ”kejriwal gets serious while talking on the chapter after Team Anna’s break up
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘log jane kya-kya kah rahe the
 Everyone was looking at us with neglect
 hamaare kai samarthak hamen agast or sitambar main chhodkar chale gaye
 Now they are coming back
 ’’ unke mutabik, sabase kharaab maheenaa april kaa rahaa jab unke or unki team ke khilaaf sajishein kii gayi
 They do not name anyone

 i could not sleep
 vajan 10 kilo kam ho gaya tha
 i then took leave and went to Vipassana
 ’’kejariwal pichley 15 saal se vipashyana kaa abhyaas kar rahe hai
 He says that it keeps his mind calm in difficult circumstances
 kejariwal ke khulaase par rajnatik tabake ne jis tarah khijhakar pratikriya di he, usase unhen bal hi mila he
 Vadra described his movement as a "mago People" movement
 khurshid ne unhen shararti kah daalaa
 Digvijay Singh alleged that Kejriwal was doing all this because he was not made a member of the National Advisory Council (NAC) headed by Sonia Gandhi
 bijepi adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne unhen ‘‘keechad oochhaalane vaala’’ kaha
 Apart from personal condemnation, there are other criticisms
 kejariwal kehete hai ki unhen raajnneeti main aane ko majaboor kiya gaya he
 They are disillusioned because they believe that Congress and BJP are two sides of the same coin
 unhone india today ko bataaya, ‘‘sab milakar bhrashtachar karte hai
 He has similar interests beyond party differences
 unke bich aghoshit samjhauta he ki vyaktiyon par hamalaa nahin bolnaa he
 He says that his team's effort is to give alternative politics to the country
 unke mutabik, ‘‘ham yah nahin kah rahe hai ki ye netaa bure hai or ham achche
 There is a problem in the system itself
 hamen use badalane ke tareeke khojane honge
 "team Kejriwal's ace of politics is actually a consistent strategy that will replace the money power in elections
" jaisaa ki prashanth bhushan kehete hai, ‘‘hamane rajnatik party banane kaa faisla isliye kiya kyonki logon kii raay hamen itani hi dur tak pahunchaa sakati he
 The person will be effective only then people will vote for him
 ’’ve rajnatik tabake se mil rahi pratikriyaaon kaa anand le rahe hai
 Yadav says, "we have shown that even a small man can shackle them by telling the truth
" ’’ team kejariwal kaa maananaa he ki netaaon ke banaae tareekon yani parivaar ko nishaanaa na banane kii reeti ko todakar usne khel kaa tarika hi badal daalaa he
 The Indian Constitution was prepared on 26 November 1949 and it is no coincidence that Kejriwal will announce his party's name on the same day
 nai party nishchit taur par netaa virdohi hogi
 According to the vision document of India Against Corruption, "swarajya will be promised" which means "the rule of the people, not the leaders and babus"
 ’’ is dastavej main rajnatik dalon ko jamkar latada gaya he: ye partiyaan ‘‘chunavi mashin hai jinka kaam matadaataaon ko pakadia or paise se satta paane tathaa satta se zyada paise banane ke liye chaare kii tarah unka istemaal karnaa he
 Kejriwal wants to turn the wheel of time back to 1947 and redefine the Indian government
 unke mutabik, swashaasan kaa arth gramsabha or muhallasabha kaa raaj he
 This is the "base" of his politics
 rajnatik agenda shashan ke vaastavik vikendrikaran ke ird-gird ghumta he jo bhartiya samvidhan main panchayat raaj ke sanshodhano main darj praavdhaanon se kahin aage kii cheez he
 According to the vision document of the IAC, 'maximum possible decisions have to be taken at the village or local level
 ye faisle janata legi, afasar yaa visheshgy nahin
 Kejriwal's vision is to establish direct democracy here
 yah vyavastha sirf switzraland main he
 There it is often criticized because the policy decision process is very poor
 bharat kii zyada aabaadi ke maddenjar yah samajhnaa mushkil he ki pratyaksh loktantr yahaan kaise teevr or behatar nirnay prakriya ko janm degaa
 Such a system can also decentralize corruption rather than eliminate it
 shahari madhyavarg ke liye kejariwal kaa aarthik agenda daraane vaala he
 Their aim is to make the institution which has made it prosperous in two decades of liberalization - free market
 iasi kaa vijan document jo ki party ke rajnatik agenda kaa aadhaar hoga, apni soch main bilkul saaf he: vikaas ‘2ji ke tark’ yaa ‘mukt bazaar’ kii takat se nirdeshit nahin ho saktaa
 According to the document, development has to be guided by the principle of 'parity' and 'necessity of the last man'
 yah dastavej hamen chathe dashak ke ant or saatven dashak kii shuruyaat main indira gandhi ke patansheel samaajwaad vaale dinon kii ore le jaataa he
 India's own experience says that this model is not effective
 lekin vijan document ke kuch hisson ko vyapak sweekaaryata mil sakati he
 The formation of an independent Jan Lokpal is one such proposal
 desh main jaisaa bhrashtachar virdohi maahaul bana he, usamen police or nyaaypalika sudhaar kaa agenda bhi manjuur ho saktaa he
 Similarly, the agenda of all education and all healthcare can also be acceptable to everyone
 lekin sawaal he ki kya ye prastaav vikendrikrut or sarvasamaveshi gandhivadi raajnneeti tathaa marxvaadi arthshaastra ke krantikari drushtikon ke paar jaakar apil kar paaenge? kejariwal bhrashtachar ke khilaaf janamat banane main kaamyaab ho chuke hai
 But it will not be easy to persuade the whole country that they can give real political options
 iasi or uske baad aane vaali rajnatik party ke saath ek samasya he
 That is, like the anti-corruption movement led by Hazare, Kejriwal's movement is also Delhi-centric
 ise kaaphi had tak shahari ilaakon main hi samarthan hasil he, jahaan upie ke bhrashtachar ko lekar aakrosh he
 This would not be right for a future political party that wants to replace all existing parties including Congress and BJP
 rashtriya party banane kaa kaam kathin he
 Kejriwal should take a lesson from BJP
 1980 main isaki sthapana ke teen dashak se zyada vakt biit jane ke baad bhi party 127 saal puraani congress kii tarah rashtravyapee maujuudagi darj karaane ke liye sangharsh kar rahi he
 History is important in politics
 congress ke paas umr kaa tajurba or aazaadee kii ladaai main hissaa lene vaale netaaon kii viraasat bhi he
 Team Kejriwal is aware of these challenges
 kejariwal or bhushan jahaan bhrashtachar ko saamne laane par khud ko kendrit kiye hue hai, vahiin yadav ko is team kii rajnatik pahunch ko badhaane kaa kaam saunpa gaya he
 On 15 October, Yadav came to Hyderabad and met Aapavu, a union of agricultural laborers
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘meraa kaam bhrashtachar virdohi andolan or maujuuda janandolanon ke bich ek sethu kii bhoomika nibhaana he

 Team Kejriwal is reaching out to specific sections in different places so that the future party base can be expanded more than the raging urban middle class
 team samaajawaadee jan parishad ke saath baatcheet kar rahi he jo aath rajyon main maujuud he
 Apart from this, talks are also going on with the Independent Democratic Party which works in Jammu, Punjab and Rajasthan and Janwahini of Uttarakhand

 When he announced to form a new political party in Delhi on 2 October, he had said, "I have to fight for my children
" main nahin laduun to ve mujhe kabhi maaf nahin karenge

 "the entire structure needs to be torn down and built from the beginning

 The Supreme Court upheld the Haj subsidy in Prafull Goradia v

 However, Justice Mishra had also said that even if the Gujarat government had enacted a law to help religious places, it would not have given compensation even if it was different
 paanch saal se lambit is maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan ahm sawaal ye tha ki agar sarkaar apni gairjimmedaari se dharmik sthal ko hue nuksaan kaa muawza detii he to kya ise kisi dharm ko protsaahan dena mana ja saktaa he? doosraa, agar kisi bade commercial complex ko dangai tabah kar dete hai to kya us nuksaan kii bharpai bhi sarkaar ko kerani chahie? agar aisa he to insurance kyon karaayaa jaataa he? The important question during the hearing of this case, which has been pending for five years, was that if the government compensates for the damage done to the religious site by its irresponsibility, can it be considered to promote any religion? Second, if the rioters destroy a large commercial complex, should the government compensate for that loss as well? If this is the case then why is insurance done? videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne ravivaar ko dakshin korea ke vyapaar, udyog or urja mantri une saing-jik se mulaakaat kii or bharat kii pramukh yojana 'mek in india' ke liye samarthan kii maang kii

 In two letters sent to Censor Chief Prasoon Joshi, Vishwaraj Singh asked some questions about Padmavati in the film
 jinka jawaab nahin diya gaya
 Vishwaraj raised the question that when the 5-minute scene of the film could not be corrected, how would the censor fix the two-hour film? What has been the controversy over Padmavati for a long time? aarope he ki sanjay lila bhansaali ne padmavati ke vyaktitv ko tod-marod kar pesh kiya he
 It is alleged that the film has a dream sequence between Rani Padmavati and Khilji
 haalanki bhansaali khud is baat ko khaarij kar chuke hai
 In a later statement, he also said that his film is based on Jayasi's Padmavat
 vivaad kii vajah se 12 disambar ko prastaavit film sensor main atak gai or isaki relies date taalani padi

 India has given a befitting reply to Pakistan and China from a strategic perspective

 Iran is planning to develop Chabahar Port as a transit hub to ease traffic to markets settled in Central Asia and in the northern part of the Indian Ocean
 4
 Pakistan has provided China with a large strategic base against India through the development of Gwadar Port in the Arabian Sea, so as soon as Chabahar Port is developed, India will get a chance to increase trade by sea for Afghanistan and Iran, and strategic From the point of view, Pakistan and China will get a befitting reply as the distance from Chabahar to Gwadar is just 60 miles
 5
 Bharat is one of the countries that has good trade relations with Iran

 The display of Galaxy Fold is smooth and fast in turning
 parformens or bydaree byaap behtareen
 The phone feels fragile and has to be used carefully
 bharat main Galaxy Fold kuch samay pehle launch ho chukaa he
 Some people are also buying it
 lagaataar kuch saalon se foldable disple vaale smartphone kii khabaren aane ke baad Galaxy Fold asaliyat ban gaya or hamane ise hafte bhar yuj kiya he
 Now, based on this, we tell you the review of Galaxy Fold
 next generation smartphone, advanced technolji vaala smartphone, ek kadam aage kaa smartphone – is tarah kii baaten is smartphone ke bare main kahi ja rahi hai
 But will this smartphone really become practical in the coming time? Will companies price the smartphone with foldable display in such a way that a normal smartphone customer can buy it? You will also have many questions in your mind
 chunki Galaxy Fold kii bharat main keemat 1
 It is more than 5 lakh rupees, so obviously this smartphone is not for everyone
 lekin jo log ise kharidne kii taiyaari kar rahe hai yaa phir foldable disple vaale smartphone main aapaki dilchaspee he to ye rivyuu jarur padhein
 The design and build quality divide the Galaxy Fold into three parts
 phone band yani anfold karke aapako ek cover screen milti he jo 4
 6 inches
 open karke aapako primary screen milti he jo sabase badi he or ye 7
 3 inches
 aakhir main iskaa rier panel aata he jahaan teen camere die gaye hai
 The fingerprint scanner is given on the phone side
 phone peeche kii taraf na mude isliye company ne isamen loking hinj diya he jise dual axis loking system kaha jaataa he
 It is quite easy to fold and unfold the phone and it feels like a delicatessen
 flip phone yuj karne jaisi feel milti he
 The design is good, the build quality is also good
 ye phone baari he or iskaa vajan 276 gram he
 If you use the phone by folding, then it takes too long and looks like Nokia E90 Communicator
 haalanki pocket main ye aasaani se feet hota he
 You will not be able to use it with one hand by opening it
 aapako donon haath se yuj karnaa hoga
 When using the primary screen it feels fragile and you will not want to force much on it, because you know that its screen is turning from the middle
 phone ko company ne solid banane kii puri koshish kii he, chunki ye first generation foldbal smartphone he to aapako ye aasaani se samaj aa jayega
 Display Samsung Galaxy Fold As we mentioned above, two displays are given
 cover screen 4
 It is 6 inches which is 1680x720p
 primary foldable disple 7
 It is 3 inches and it is 2152x1536p, it is super AMOLED
 primary disple ke centre main, jahaan se ye phone mudata he, aap krij dekh paaenge
 However, you will not see this crease when you are watching video content on the phone or using an app
 screen blike he to aap krij aasaani se notice kar lenge
 You need to take some care in folding
 disple ko lekar samsung hameshaa se market lead rahaa he or ye baat Galaxy Fold main bakhubi dikhti he
 Here you get support of HDR10 +
 britaness acchhee, color sateek hai
 7
 3 inch kii disple par Netflix or duusare strimming plateform par videos dekhne kaa hamaara anubhav shandaar rahaa he
 However, due to the aspect ratio of some videos, you will see letterboxing up and down
 agar phone main aap kuch articals pard rahe hai to rhite corner par diya gaya front camera modul kuch text yaa photose hide kar legaa
 The screen is also good in outdoor, especially when you use its cover screen in outdoor, it will be a good experience
 screen paryaapt brit he taaki aapako raushnee main bhi disple dekhne main koi dikkat na ho
 One thing is certain that normally you will use its cover screen more
 kyonki har baar, har jagah aap ise anfold karne kii sthiti main nahin honge
 Unfolding with one hand and using it can prove dangerous
 maine bhi zyaadaatar samay isaki cover disple ko yuj kiya he
 Now the problem here is that this display is quite thin
 haalanki yahaan se bhi aap wo sab kaam kar sakate hai jo primary disple karenge, yahaan tak kii aap is choti screen par Call Of Duty jaise games bhi khel sakenge
 If the company had done more work on the cover screen then this smartphone could have been even better, because the cover screen seems quite small
 ise or draig kiya janaa chahie tha or chin ko patala kiya ja saktaa tha, taaki screen badi ho sake
 Performance and software Galaxy Fold is not the best in terms of performance, but is good
 kai experimental chijen company ne di hai jo dhire dhire thik kii ja sakati hai
 The company has also done a lot of work on software
 is smartphone main Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 procesar diya gaya he
 In the case of multi-tasting, this smartphone is king
 company ne iske software kaaphi kaam kiya he or interphes ko aisa banaaya he taaki aapke lage kii aap tradishnal smartphone yuj nahin kar rahe hai
 While using it many times, i thought that if the company wants to mainstream this smartphone, then what will happen to the Galaxy Note series
 bhale hi aapako Galaxy Fold main s Pen na diya gaya ho, lekin multi tasking main iskaa koi jawaab nahin he
 You can do heavy gaming in Galaxy Fold
 maine sirf isamen Call of Duty: Mobile tri kiya he
 But could not play for long
 vajah he isaki disple, kyonki gaming main aap aksar aakraamak hote hai or screen par ko jor se tach karte hai or is sthiti main chances hai ki isaki screen damege ho sakati he
 Most apps work well in big screens
 soshal media yuj karne kaa bhi anubhav shandaar rahaa he
 We have already told you about videos that the experience of watching videos in it is also good
 disple par ek saath teen windo open karke alag alag kaam kar sakate hai
 For example, watch the video, use Twitter and you can also be chatting on whatsapp
 badi screen kaa phayda yahaan aapako puri tarah se miltaa he
 Cover Screen You are watching youtube videos and the video will appear on the big screen as soon as you unfold the phone
 ye saport or bhi eps main diya gaya he
 You can enable this by going into the display settings
 ye kaaphi fayedmand feechar he
 Using different apps, organizing and switching to other apps - all these things work very well in this smartphone, or rather they are the best
 phone lag nahin karata he, fast he, smood he
 Folding unfolding makes the phone's screen stable and apps load much faster
 cameraoghaldy Fold main total chah camere die gaye hai
 Three cameras on the rear panel
 ek selfi camera cover disple ke upar or do camere badi disple ke upar
 That is, you are not going to have any problem in photography because of the folded display
 camera spekes kii baat karen to cover disple main 10 megapixl kaa camera he
 On unfolding, you will get two cameras of 10 megapixels and 8 megapixels
 rier panel par die gaye main camere kii baat karen to yahaan 12 megapixl kaa lens or 12 megapixl kaa telephoto lens diya gaya he
 a lens is ultra wide
 ye puraa seoup Galaxy S10 Plus vaala hi he
 The photography from the rear camera will be similar to that of the Galaxy S10 Plus
 hamane aapako Galaxy S10 Plus ke rivyuu main bhi bataaya he ki ye camera modul behad shandaar he or aap isse acchhee photography kar sakate hai
 The ultra wide angle lens is quite aggressive and gives a larger coverage in clicked photos
 yahaan clic karke aap Galaxy S10 Plus kaa phul rivyuu pard sakate hai
 After doing normal photography you get the best quality
 kam raushnee manr kii gai photography main aap noage notice karenge
 Talking about selfie camera, two cameras have been given above the primary display, one of which is RGB sensor
 isamen live focus kaa saport he or thik thaak selfi clic kar sakate hai
 But again, it is not the best experience
 isi tarah cover disple ke upar diya gaya front sensor he jisase bhi aap selfi clic kar sakate hai jo aivarej he
 Battery backup Galaxy Fold has a battery of 4,380mah
 bhale hi ye aapako ye Fold main die gaye disple ke lihaaj se kam powerful lage, lekin is smartphone kaa bydaree byaap behtareen he
 It also has support for powershare and wireless charging
 powershere feechar se aap kisi duusare wireles charging smartphone yaa accessories ko charge kar sakate hai
 Fast charging has been supported, but if you charge it with a traditional charger, it will take several hours to be fully charged
 is smartphone ke mixd yuj main puure din kaa byaap mil jayega
 Runs from 9 am to 7 am and 30% battery remains even after that
 standbai byaap bhi acha he
 Since i generally use the cover display of this smartphone more, due to this the backup is even better
 agar aap heavi yuj karte hai to to bhi aap subah se shaam tak ise bina bich main charge kiye aaraam se yuj kar sakenge
 It will last more than 24 hours in normal use
 kya aapako ye smartphone khareednaa chahie?galaxy Fold ek mahangaa, najuk he or futuristic smartphone he
 Performance, from display to almost every segment, this smartphone has no answer
 lekin ye first generation foldable smartphone he isliye hamane jo kamiyaan bataai hai us par bhi aapako dhyaan rakhana hoga
 However if your budget 1
 5 lakh tak he to aap ye smartphone khariden, niraash nahin honge

 81-ek din main baba par lad die gaye 81 mukademe200- patanjali peeth par chal rahe mukademon kii sankhya 200 he1000- ek hajaar se bhi adhik notice baba se judi sansthaaon ko jarijab tak nehru vansh kaa samul naash nahin kar duungaa or congress ko satta se bedakhal nahin kar duungaa tab tak patanjali peeth waapas nahin lautoonga
 On December 6, 54-year-old Ram Krishna Yadav alias Baba Ramdev, who left his ashrams spread over thousands of acres in Haridwar and camped in a seeker's home in Delhi's Paschim Vihar area, spoke in a terse tone
 uttarakhand sarkaar ne jis tarah se is yoga guru ke khilaaf bade paimaane par morcha kholaa he usase baba tamtamaae hue hai
 The government has flushed out all their old files and filed 81 cases against their institutions in one stroke in November
 tab se lekar ek maah ke bheetar baba par 99 mukademe darj kiye ja chuke hai
 (patanjali Yogpeeth- Baba looks after the work from this establishment in Haridwar) All these cases are 3 to 8 years old and are being filed against the man, who claimed that he had done in favor of BJP in the assembly elections of four states
 BJP won 93 out of 126 sabhas
 chhattisgarh main jisaki sabhaaon ke kharch ko chunaav ayog ne bijepi pratyaashiyon ke chunaav kharch main jodgaye kaa faisla kiya
 On November 20, Chief Minister Bahuguna presented cases of benami land, land misuse, stamp theft and illegal possession related to Baba at a press conference in Dehradun
 unhone bade bholepan se kaha ki haridwar kii jiladhikari kii jaanch-padtaal ke baad ye maamle saamne aae hai
 (ayurveda College- Recognition restored after Supreme Court verdict) Bahuguna also explained the meaning of morality to the Yoga Guru and also advised that no other meaning should be taken out of the cases
 lekin chunavi maahaul main is pahal ko baba ramdev ke bhrashtachar ke rup main kam or desh bhar main baba ke congress virdohi prachaar kii dhar kund karne ke rup main zyada dekha gaya
 We will also discuss the details of the cases, but before that, look at what Baba said to India Today, "if Bahuguna has any quality and Ramdev has committed any crime, arrest me and show me
 main to yaheen janata ke bich baitha hum
 If i am a criminal, why have i left it open? ”(food and Herbal Park - This is where the products of Baba's companies are made) Will Baba be surrounded? The case of Baba cannot be dismissed in full
 uttarakhand sarkaar aaj jin mukademon kaa jhunjhuna baja rahi he, vah bahut purana or jarjar he
 But more than that, on June 4, 2011, when Baba Ramdev was fasting at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan and the police crushed the movement
 tab baba mahilaon ke kapade pahanakar bhaage the
 The next day, the Prime Minister's Office had asked for an investigation into similar revenue theft cases
 tab piemo ne kaha tha ki baba par chal rahe 58 karod ru
 Cases of revenue theft will be investigated
 aaj bahuguna ne jo mukademe darj kiye hai unamem se aadhe se zyada mukademe vahi hai
 In such a situation, the question arises that if Baba Ramdev is such a big thug, then why did the PMO itself not catch him in two years? 27 cases have been filed under Section 154 (4) (3) B? / 166 / 167 of the Zamindari Abolition Land Reform Act
 vahiin 52 maamle section 47 indian stamp act ke tahat darj hai or inamen 10 karod ru
 Is accused of revenue theft
