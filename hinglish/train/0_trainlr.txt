 He took power for the second time in February 1997 and was Prime Minister until the 1999 coup

 bhagwant maan maamle main bani kirit somaiya cameti na keval banty hui he balki zyaadaatar gaiyr bijepi sadsy chaahate hai ki sansad kaa video banane or website par post karne ke maamle main maan ko adhiktam sajaa nahin honi chahie
 Many members of the committee believe that the suspension sentence given to Mann is sufficient
 cameti ke sadsy 14 dinon tak intjaar karne ke bajaay jald hi antarim report pesh karnaa chaahate hai
 The videography of Bhagwant Mann once again came out of the Somaiya Committee on Thursday to gauge the security of Parliament, but it consisted of only three Shiv Sena members Anandrao Adsul, apart from three BJP members
 cameti ke baaki sadsy is videography daure se dur hi rahe
 Kirit Somaiya told NDTV that all the members of the committee were told that anyone who wants to come in could come, but apart from Somaiya, Meenakshi Lekhi and Satyapal Singh, the three BJP members of the committee were Anandrao Adsul of Shiv Sena

 sawaal yahi he ki kya cameti agle hafte koi antarim report pesh karegi? The truth is that while the BJP is strict on Bhagwant Mann, the non-bjp members of the committee are saying that there should not be maximum punishment in this case
 bhagwant maan ko pehle hi do hafte ke liye suspend kiya ja chukaa he
 Some non-bjp members believe that this punishment is enough
 cameti ko apni report ke liye do hafte kaa atirikt vakt mila he lekin sutron ne enditivi india ko bataaya ki kai sadsy chaahate hai ki do hafte tak intjaar karne ke bajaay jald se jald antarim report pesh kii jaae
 Bhagwant Mann, in his defense, argued in front of the committee that some cases of security in the case have been mentioned
 isamen maan ne ek bijepi saansad ke suraksha se samjhaute kaa bhi zikr kiya he
 The comments cameti ke sabhi sadsy maanate hai ki sansad kii suraksha sarvopari he lekin maan ke maamle ko siyaasi rup se na ghasita jaae or unhen chetavanee dekar choda ja saktaa he
 Trinamool Congress 'derrick o'brien (who is not a committee member) told the media,' We have seen Mann's video
 unki harakat bachakaani or galat ho sakati he lekin unka iraadaa galat nahin lagata he
 Bhagwant Mann has already been suspended by suspension
 unke khilaaf jaanch bhi ho rahi he
 Now if this matter is dragged further, it is wrong
 aise main ham yahi maanenge ki aane vaale (punjab) chunaavon ko dekhte hue aisa kiya ja rahaa he jo ki galat hoga
 ' udhar cameti ke bijepi sadasyon kaa rukh kadaa he
 Kirit Soumaiya has denied any differences in the committee
 somaiya ne kaha ki suraksha ko lekar sabaki ek raay he
 Apart from Bhagwant Mann, the committee formed to examine Mann has recorded the statement of Watch and Ward security personnel of Parliament, Delhi Police and Joint Secretary in the matter of security

 van vibhaag or police kii madad se shavakon ke khun ke namoonay liye gaye, taaki diene se unki maa tak pahunchaa ja sake
 Talking to NDTV India, Anish said that there could be many reasons for the tigress's disappearance
 yaa to vah kisi baagh ke saath sangharsh ke dauraan kuen main gir gai ho yaa phir jaharila maance khaane kii vajah se uski maut ho gai ho
 But on such occasions the body of a tigress should be found, which has not happened

 In such a situation, there is another possibility that the tigress may have been killed
 aisa hua he to vyavastha ko isse sachet hona hoga, kyon ki baaghon ke shikari ek akele baagh kii shikaar ke liye nahin aate
 There are currently 204 adult tigers in Maharashtra
 rajya sarkaar inke sangrakshan ke liye bharsak koshish bhi kar rahi he
 In such a situation, the disappearance of a tigress in Chandrapur is considered a challenge to the government effort

 maharashtra baaghon kii ginati main desh main awwal rahaa he
 Now the challenge before him is to find the whereabouts of the missing tigress and find out the reason for her disappearance

 Blood samples of the cubs were taken with the help of the forest department and the police, so that their mother could be reached with DNA
 NDTV india se baat karte hue anish ne kaha ki baghin ke laapata hone ke kai kaaran ho sakate hai
 Either she fell into a well during a struggle with a tiger or she died due to eating poisonous meat
 lekin aise maukon par baghin kaa shav milanaa chahie, jo ki nahin hua he
 The staff of the department is scrutinizing the area around the bodies of the cubs
 aise main ek or sambhaavna he ki baghin kii hatya hui ho
 If this happens, the system has to be aware of this, because tiger hunters do not come to hunt a tiger alone

 This is not often the case when every liberal and foreign proponent, who is indifferent to foreign unionism, is seen as a liberal advocate for opening the economy
 modi sarkaar kaa faisla he ki bharat ab bond ke jariye videshi bazaaron se karj legaa
 These bonds will be based on India's sovereign credit (sovereign rating)
 isse pehle aisa kabhi nahin hua tha
 Conservative indigenes of the government's family think that this will blow the skies and liberals feel that the Modi government is making an unwarranted attempt to attract headlines which will put it in trouble
 donon hi bematlab daraa rahe hai
 While there is victory against this fear
 yahaan se ek bade sudhaar kii shuruyaat ho sakati he
 Foreign debt is not new to India
 sarkaar ko bahupaksheeya sansthaaon (vishwa bank, edibi) or deshon (jaise bullate train ke liye japan) se karj miltaa rahaa he
 This debt is between countries or institution and country
 karj bazaar kaa is par koi asar nahin hota
 Indian companies take loans from all over the world in exchange for their credit, which is not recorded in the government's account
 sarkaar ke adhikansh karj desh ke bheetar se aate hai or rupye main hote hai
 This debt will be in dollars and will have to be repaid in dollars
 dollar mahangaa hone se yah karj badhegaa
 Like other countries of the world, which take loans from world markets, India will have a rating of credit
 bharat ke bond duniya ke bazaaron main soochibaddh honge
 India initially wants to raise only a total of ten billion dollars
 phayda yah ki yah karj gharelu bazaar kii tulana main lagbhag aadhi laagat par milegaa
 After this bond, the government will take less debt from the domestic market
 is pahal se bharat ko tatkaal koi khatra nahin he
 India's position in such foreign debt, risk scales measured, is better
 jidipi ke anupaat main bharat kaa kul samprabhu videshi karj keval 3
 8 percent
 videshi mudra (428 arab dollar) karj anupaat bhi 75 fisad ke behatar str par he
 In the case of such bonds, India should be compared to Brazil, China, Indonesia, Mexico, Philippines and Thailand
 bharat kii kul aay ke anupaat main videshi karj 19
 8 percent (indonesia, Mexico is more than 35 percent)
 isamen samprabhu ganrti par liya gaya videshi karj to china va thailand kii tulana main bahut kam he
 The Swadeshi and the Left were intimidating even in 1991 and 95, but if India had not liberalized, it would have been a bigger loss
 daraane waalon ko khabar ho ki bharat main bharpoor videshi puunji pehle se he
 Foreign investment in the stock markets ($ 433 billion) and FDI ($ 325 billion) is more than the total foreign debt ($ 104 billion) on the government ($ 309 billion) and companies
 isliye das arab dollar ke sowerin karj se pralay nahin aa jaaegi, balki agar modi sarkaar is faisle par aage badhati he to ek badi aarthik paardarshita ubharegi
 India will have to be a part of the Global Dollar Index for the first time
 is darje kii badi keemat he or jokhim bhi
 The Indian government will have to make all its financial data transparent and give up the habit of hiding losses or debts
 sarkaar hamen centre or rajyon ke karj va ghate kii aadhi adhuri tasviir dikhaati he
 npas of banks, loans of nbfcs, loans to be kept out of the budget such as small savings schemes or loans laden on government companies, loans of credit cards etc
, losses of government companies
 
 
 duniya ke niveshkon ab aarthik sehat kii koi bhi jaankaree chhipaana mahangaa padegaa
 The amount of money from this bond, rather it will be important that how India manages its risk, now the whole world has to be assured of financial transparency based on which India's sovereign credibility will be determined which will tell where we stand in the world market
 
 jo reating hamen videsh main milegi, desh kaa bazaar bhi usee hisaab se karj degaa
 Burned investors from Greece, Turkey, Argentina, Thailand, Brazil are no longer spared
 badahaal aarthik prabandhan ke kaaran in mulkon ko bond bazaar main badi sajaa jhelni padi
 It is worth remembering that Greece sank because it had hidden its losses
 bond bazaar jhooth se sabase zyada bidakta he
 James Carville, an advisor to US President Bill Clinton, used to say that if i get reincarnated, i will not be the president or the pope but the bond market, which can scare everyone
 bond aane dijie, duniya kaa dar hi bharat sarkaar ko apane taur-tareeke badalane main madad karegaa

 "the flames are so strong that they can also be seen from the Gateway of India, 8 kilometers away
" rahangdale ke mutabik, agnishmankarmi puri raataag bujhaneke kaam main lage rahe or ab unhen raahat di gayi he or is kaam main nae karmchaariyon ko lagaaya gaya he
 Let us tell you that oil tankers deliver crude oil to Butcher Island and from here it reaches the refinery with the help of pipelines
 embipiti adhikariyon ke liye aag ko jald se jald bujhaana behad jaruri he, kyonki port 1
 It holds 79 lakh kiloliters of oil, in which case the accident may be even more severe
 rahangdale ke mutabik, ‘‘mumbaignishmankarmiyonor mumbai port trust (embipiti) ke fire fiters ke bich acha saamanjasy rahaa
 Firefighters had reached the 10-foot distance of the tank, but a new challenge faced us in the morning due to the fire re-igniting in the tank
 aag par kaabo paa liya gaya he
 "I have been monitoring this entire operation, because the heat used to extinguish the foam used in fire extinguishers is not settling properly, due to which the fire is rekindling
" lekin kul milakar sthiti niyantran main he
 Rahangadale did not clarify how long this campaign would last
 unhone kaha, ‘‘hamaari mukhya chunauti duusare tinkon ko aag se surakshit rakhana he
 So on the one hand our fire personnel are engaged in cooling work to keep other tanks safe, on the other hand they are also engaged in fire extinguishing

 Money also matters
 If rumors are to be believed, Warner and Australia cricket team captain Michael Clarke will be able to get a USD 50 million deal for 10 years if they leave the ICC structure
 cricket website iespien crickinfo newarnerake hawaale se likhaa, 'philhal meraa cricket austrailia se anubandh he, tathy yah he ki main austrailia ke liye khel rahaa hum
 i am doing this and i like it but, they are talking huge amount and honestly, if people are telling you that they do not play for money then you will laugh
 kyonki prayek vyakti jise isaki peshkash kii gai he yaa kii jaaegi to ve hameshaa ise sweekaar karenge
 "if the league goes out then Test cricket will end," he added, "I think players generally need to be a bit more honest and let them know what is happening

 " hong-kong besd tech company sound van ne bharat main farvari ke maheene main apane neckband style vaale X60 wireles headphone ko launch kiya tha
 This headphone with Bluetooth connectivity is designed for both music and calls
 company ne isaki keemat 3,490 rupee rakhi he, haalanki flipcart abhi ye 1,890 rupee main uplabdh he
 We have used this headphone for a long time and now we are passing it on to you
 dizin or bild quality:is wireles headphone ke dizin kii baat karen to ye vajan main kaaphi halkaa he
 Any headband with a neckband has a problem of light and thin device
 aise main ye thik he
 It is not very premium in appearance nor is there any attraction in its packaging
 band ke upar rabar kii soft rabar kii coating kii gai he
 The design of the given button is also not much special
 yahaan left said main virtual assistant active karne ke liye van tach batan diya gaya he
 At the same time, multi-function buttons and volume buttons are provided in the ride side
 multi function batan se on-of karne samet kol cat-risive or redayal karne jaise kaam hote hai or wolum buttens main plus batan ko dabaakar rakhane se wolum badhati he or ek baar dabaane par trek change hota he
 Similarly, the negative button works in the volume buttons
 isse wolum kam hoti he
 Apart from this, they are of small design when it comes to earplugs
 aise main aasaani se kaanon main feet baith jate hai or kaanon main chubte bhi nahin hai
 But these earplugs are connected to the band with which they are very average wire
 inaki quality chune se bhi kaaphi everej lagati he or ye luk ke hisaab se bhi kaaphi nimna str kaa lagata he
 It is also possible that when pulled a bit, this wire breaks and breaks
 yahaan yearplag main drivers ke peeche ke hisse main magnet diya gaya he jo inhen upyog naa hone kii sthiti main chipkaakar rakhata he
 However, these magnets do not perform any other function like earplugs magnets of other companies
 parformens or audio quality:sabase pehle connactivity kii baat karen to yahaan bluetooth 4
 Support of 2 is provided
 aise main ye smartphone, computer or audio players ke liye kaaphi compatible he
 Also, there is no problem in connectivity
 auto connactivity hone kii vajah se headphone aasaani se smartphone se conect bhi ho jaataa he
 Its connectivity range is up to 10m which is better
 ab audio quality kii baat karen to Sound One X60 kii range 20-20,000hz tak he
 Also, Qualcomm's aptx codec technology has also been used for better quality here
 baharhaar audio quality kii baat karen to hamane is headphone main kaaphi tarah ke mujeec jaise- clasical, rock, jaij, regeton, deep house, ecostic, EDM, trans or dabstep ko headphone se suna or paaya ki ye Lows yani ye base ke liye behatar he
 At the same time, Mids and Highs are quite weak
 yani aap yahaan everej sound quality kaa anand le paaenge
 Here you will not feel base and you will clearly find a lack of crisp in the rest of the music
 haalanki acchhee baat ye he ki aapako aawaaj puri tarah badhaane ke baad bhi koi kharaab aawaaj kaa saamana nahin karnaa hoga
 After this, if you talk about the voice button, it works fine
 in sabake baad colling kii baat karen to yahaan ye headphone tarif batorne ke laayak he
 Because you will get a lot of clarity in calling as well, connectivity will also get better and you will not be disturbed by any kind of external noise
 bydaree:ant main bydaree parformens kii baat karen to company ke daawey ke mutabik ise single charge main 8 se 10 ghante tak chalaaya ja saktaa he or yahaan company kaa daawa sahi he
 We did not face any problem with the battery
 saath hi ise charge karne main 2 ghante kaa samay lagata he
 One bad thing is that this headphone gives you continuous ring alert as soon as the battery is 20 percent, in such a situation, you can get upset while watching any music or video in low battery
 faisla:ye kul milakar ek everej wireles neckband headphone he
 Currently it is being made available for Rs 1,890
 is keemat main is linewet headphone par paisa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 These headphones are fine for the base but crisp will not be found in the overall audio quality
 duusari kami iske luk or vir main he
 Also some functions could be added to magnets
 baharhaal agar aap thodaa paisa or lagaana chahen to samsung ke Level u bluetooth hedset ko 2,499 rupee main kharid sakate hai

 india today televijan ke 'tu da point' kaarykram main die intervyuu main menon ne kaha ki pakistan dwaara viksit kiye gaye chote parmaanu hathiyaaron ke istemaal kii jimmedaari yudhakshetra main nichle kram ke adhikariyon ko saunpi jaaegi, jo sena main yuva adhikari honge or dharmik str par behad prerit tathaa kam se kam peshewar honge
 Menon, who had previously been a national security adviser against carrying out a nuclear strike, said that this meant that the threat of using such small nuclear weapons against India increased
 unhone kaha ki aisi sthiti main parmaanu yuddh kii ashanka bad jaati he, kyonki bharat iskaa jawaab vyapakparmaanu hathiyaronse degaa
 He said that the policy of first use of nuclear weapons, which has been mentioned by Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar, will not be in India's interest
 menon ne kaha ki bharat ke parmaanu hathiyaar pakistani aatankwaadiyon ko hatotsahit karne ke liye nahin hai
 "pakistan's threat to respond to a nuclear attack with a nuclear weapon would be like using a gun to kill a mosquito and it would be beyond the comprehension of the people of India," he said
 ' purv videsh sachiv ne kaha ki bharat kii pakistan niti ko hameshaa vaastaviktaa ke sandarbh main nahin dekha gaya
 Talking about the 26 / 11 Mumbai attack, which was given to the President at the time of 26 / 11, Menon said that he asked him to give a befitting reply against the terrorist camps or ISI in lashkar-e-taiba or Pakistan occupied Kashmir at that time Was
 videsh sachiv ke rup main unhone tatkaaleen videsh mantri pranab mukherjee tathaa pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko salaah di thi ki bharat ko munhtod jawaab dena chahie or yah dikhnaa chahie
 He said that Mukherjee had agreed with my words
 lekin unhone is mudde par manmohan singh kii pratikriya ke bare main khulaasa nahin kiya, haalanki ant main bharat ne iskaa sainya jawaab nahin diya
 'surgical strike was very important' After the terrorist attack in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir, the Indian Army called the surgical strike on September 28 in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir very important
 unhone kaha, 'bharat ko nirnaayak sainya samaadhaan ke bina lambey vakt tak seemaa paar se aatankwaad ko rokane ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 Menon believes that Pakistan cannot actually control terrorism
 unhone kaha ki aatankwaad kii jaden pakistan ke samaaj va raajnneeti main hai

 ayodhya vivaad par supreme court ke faisle se saaf he ki vah kisi tarah ke kintu-parantu kii koi gunjaaish nahin chhodana chahta tha
 Therefore, the Supreme Court of India, bypassing the Allahabad High Court's ruling, ordered that the disputed land of Ayodhya is being given to Ramlala Virajman
 iske saath hi supreme court ne mandir-masjid donon kaa bhavishya tay kar diya he
 After this decision of the Supreme Court, Muslim party Iqbal Ansari expressed happiness and said that he does not want to appeal against it

 After the performance of the MLA in the election, he will be included in the cabinet again
 shivaraj ne kaha abhi mantrimandal chota hoga or saaf chhavi ko logon ko liya jaayegaa

 In the climate of the country these days, the cow is not producing even as much cow protection
 is vaqt gaayon ko lekar jo dar kaa maahaul chal rahaa he wo lagaataar surkhiyon batore hue he, jiske chalate gaay or uske saath sahi iraade se ja rahe logon ke zehan main bhi dar rach bas gaya he
 The sad fact is that PM Modi's appeal against this fear has also proved to be unacceptable and now former minister Kapil Mishra is not left untouched by this fear
 kapil mishra ab apni gaay lakshmi se rojaanaa nahin mil paaenge
 The village of Lakshmi is also misguided as this silence of silence has taken place in the minds of these idiots that now they are going to their home from their owner forever
 darasal kapil mishra ne mantri nivas milte hi apane ghar main do gaay paali thi jinka naam lakshmi or bholi he or in do gaayon ke do bachade bhi hai jo nandini or shiva ke naam se pukaare jate hai
 These four, who have become important members of Kapil's family, will no longer be able to live together due to the vacant minister's residence
 darasal kapil mishra ne apane parivaar ke saath yah ghar 2 din pehle hi khaali kar diya tha magar unhen rojaanaa yahaan sirf apane chaar pashuon kii dekhbhaal karne ke liye aana padataa tha
 The reason for this was that due to the fear of alleged cow protection in the country at this time, no one was ready to take their cows to the tampo
 isliye police se ijaajat kaa patr liya gaya or police suraksha main kapil mishra ke ghar se in gaayon ko le jaaya gaya
 Ashok, who took care of the cow in Kapil's house, wanted to take a cow Nandini to his house in Bulandshahr but the fear of the guardians overshadowed his cow love and he could not take these steps
 zaahir he bholi, lakshmi, nandini, shiva ko nahin maaloom ki mantri nivas kya hota he or notice ke chalate kitne din main ghar khaali karnaa hota he
 The animal only understands the language of love and due to this love, he was not ready to leave the house to leave the house
 lekin sarkaar ke farmaan ke aage purv mantri kii nahin chali to in bejubaan jaanwaron kii kaise chali
 Lakshmi, Nandini, Bholi and Siva had to leave Kapil Mishra's government house

 In response to this controversy, Ananthamurthy, who was the president of the Academy, said, 'I was very opposed to Nehru and Indira Gandhi, but till date no response of any Congress leader has been the same as the slut reaction of BJP leaders and There were supporters

 In response, Naik further said that health is a state subject and constipation patients can avail treatment from the respective departments of government-run hospitals
 unhone kaha ki centre rajya ke prayaason ko or behatar banegaa
 Significantly, the film released on May 8 on the cinematic screen, Amitabh Bachchan's film 'piku' also revolved around an old man suffering from constipation
 film main is swasthya samasya ko bhaavnaatmak dhaage main piroyaa gaya tha, jise darshakon ne bhi khub saraahaa tha
 The Bharatiya Janata Party's ally Shiv Sena has once again targeted the BJP government in an editorial in its mouthpiece 'saamana'
 'saamana' main kashmir main lagaataar ho rahe aatanki hamalon or jawan aurangzeb ke apharan or hatya ko lekar bijepi par tanj ksaa he
 This editorial is titled 'orgy in Kashmir'
 isamen bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate hue likhaa gaya he ki ab tak ayodhya main ram mandir to bana nahin, ram aaj bhi vanvaas main hai lekin desh kii suraksha bhi ab ram bharose hi chal rahi he
 Regarding the attacks on the occasion of Ramadan, the BJP has been written in this letter of siege that the terrorist attacks which are happening on the occasion of Ramadan will have to bear the sin of the government
 centre sarkaar ne ramajaan ke maukey par seemaa par sijafire kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 In the month of Ramadan, the government had decided to introduce a unilateral ceasefire but continued attacks from Pakistan
 matlab ham ramajaan kii pavitrataa kaa sammaan karen or pakistan hamaare khun se ramajaan kii iftaar kare
 The BJP government has also been targeted for the kidnapping and murder of Jawan Aurangzeb from Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir and the murder of Shujaat Bukhari, the editor of Rising Kashmir
 bukhari ke bare main kaha gaya he ki wo saamana kii tarah hi kashmir main kaam kar rahe the lekin hamaari sarkaar aise raashtra bhakt kii raksha nahin kar saki
 The terrorists are working to pacify every voice raising in support of India and we are only honoring the sanctity of Ramadan and breaking the morale of the soldiers, it is not manhood
 piem se lekar rakshaamantri or grahamantri tak par saadhaa nishanisamen kaha gaya ki pradhanmantri videsh dauron par rahete hai or rakshaamantri party ke kaary main lagi rahati hai or grahamantri he bhi or nahin bhi hai
 The PM is said to have raised the nation's neck around the world, but the United Nations (UN) has worked to break this neck
 saath hi kaha gaya he ki kashmir samasya ke jitne chithde congress ne udaae usase kahi zyada maujuuda centre kii sarkaar ne udaae hai
 It is sad that we are sending our soldiers to the slaughterhouse of the terrorists in the 'security' of the country, which is getting red with blood in the valley
 piem ke ghar par (akaash main udati hui) ek udan tashtaree dikhaai di to suraksha agency ne piem kii suraksha ko chaakchauband kar diya
 This has to be done for the safety of the PM, but the security of the country is getting red with blood in the Kashmir Valley every day
 sarkaar ne ekatarfa yudhbandi jari kar hamaare javaanon ko use sakhti se nibhaane par majaboor kiya, jiskaa phayda uthaakar kashmir main aatankiyon kaa nanga naach jari he
 With this, every voice of Hindustani love is being suppressed there
 aise main aapaki antarrashtriya yatra or raajnneeti asafal ho jaati he
 Please tell that Rising Kashmir editor Shujaat Bukhari was killed in broad daylight, while Aurangzeb, an Indian Army soldier, was kidnapped from Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir, later Aurangzeb's bullet-riddled body was recovered from the jungles of Pulwama

 Revolution began against Indira Gandhi during this time
 During Indira Gandhi's rule, the country was struggling with issues including inflation and the people were angry about the Indira-led central government
 us vakt jaiprakash narayan ne satta ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane kaa faisla kiya or unhone indira gandhi ko patr likhaa or desh ke bigadate halaat ke bare main bataaya
 After that, he also wrote a letter to other mps of the country and described many of Indira Gandhi's decisions as a democratic threat
 lokapal kii thi maangajayprakash narayan ke is patr se raajnneetik jagat main hangaamaa khadaa ho gaya tha, kyonki pehali baar kisi ne indira gandhi ke khilaaf sidhe aawaaj uthaai thi

 After which there were agitations in the state and many agitators were killed due to police brutality
 is dauraan 24 janvari 1974 mukhyamantri ke istife kii taarikh tay kar di gai
 But the movement was further fueled by the attitude of Chiman Bhai
 uske baad jaiprakash narayan ne andolan kaa samarthan kiya, jiske baad unhen gujarat bulaayaa gaya
 Let me tell you that on 5 June 1974, JP gave the slogan of complete revolution against Indira Gandhi
 jaiprakash narayan ke gujarat jane se pehle unhone rajyapal ke jariye apane haath main satta rakhane kii koshish kii or 9 farvari 1974 ko jaiprakash narayan ke gujarat aane se do din pehle hi chimanbhai se istipha dilava diya or pradesh main raashtrapati shashan laga diya
 After that Morarji Desai demanded a re-election with Narayan
 saath hi yah andolan bihar jaise anya rajyon main bhi failane laga
 After that lakhs of railway employees went on strike, which led to a problem in front of Indira Gandhi as to who to deal with first? Impact of the movement in Bihar Like in Gujarat also in Bihar, the students agitated and traveled towards the assembly
 uske baad chaatro ke khilaaf ection liya gaya, goliyaan chalaai gai, jisamen kai chaatr maare gaye or jepi ko andolan kii kaman sanbhaalane kii maang kii gai
 However, JP, before taking charge of the movement, said that no person should be associated with any party in this movement
 uske baad logon ne unki sabhi maang lee or raajnneetik partio se jude hue chaatro ne bhi istipha dekar jepi ke saath jane kaa faisla kiya
 Many Congress students were also involved in this and all the students jumped into the movement under the banner of Bihar Students Struggle Committee
 iske baad jepi ne apane haath main andolan kii kaman le lee or bihar ke mukhyamantri abdul gafoor se istife kii maang kii
 jp's warning During that time JP said that his fight against corruption, black marketing etc
 is going on and he said that the movement should continue
 uske baad indira gandhi ne jaiprakash narayan ke aadhaar par kaha ki kuch log gram vikaas main apni ruchi khokar sakriy raajnneeti main utarane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 After this, many people including Congressmen started opposing it
 uske baad indira ke jaiprakash virdohi bayanon se andolan badhata gaya or jaiprakash narayan ne andolan ko tikhaa karne kaa kaam kiya
 After that Jayaprakash Narayan intensified the movement to remove the government
 is andolan ne hilaa di satta8 april 1974 ko jaiprakash narayan ne virodh ke liye juluus nikaala, jisamen satta ke khilaaf acroshit janata ne hissaa liya
 Thousands, not only, participated in it and it was spearheaded by Jayaprakash Narayan himself
 jaiprakash narayan ke is andolan se indira gandhi ke neeche se satta kii jameen khisakane lagi or baad main indira gandhi ko virodh kaa itnaa saamana karnaa padaa ki unke haath main satta zyada vakt nahin bachi rahi

 After reaching Dhaka for the Asia Cup, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma watched videos of Pakistani spin bowler Saeed Ajmal for several hours
 is chakkar main unhone din kaa khaanaa or ek abhyaas satr bhi chhod diya
 When on March 18, Pakistani cricketers gathered in the dressing room and vowed to avenge the defeat at the hands of India in the semi-final of the World Cup, remembering their former coach Bob Woolmer, Kohli sneaked into Sharma's ear
 We have done our homework (for this match)
 ’ lekin pakistan ne jab 329 ranon kaa pahaad khadaa kar diya to captain mahendra singh dhoni samet duusare khilaadiyon ko bhi ehsaas ho gaya ki lakshya utana aasaan nahin
 From the top, when the opener Gautam Gambhir got out lbw on the second ball of the innings without returning to open the account, then the dreaded silence in the stadium was making a lot of statement in itself
 lekin yaheen vishwa cricket kaa ek aitihaasik pal aakaar le rahaa tha
 The 'god' of cricket, standing at the other end, landed with Sachin Tendulkar, 23-year-old young cricketer from Delhi, Kohli
 bharat kaa khaataa khule bagaiyr ek wicket gir jane ke baavjood ve sthitiyon se bilkul prabhavit nahin hue
 Tendulkar, his inspiration and partner on the wicket, had completed a century of centuries in the previous match, although India lost that match to Bangladesh
 lekin pakistan ke khilaaf us match main donon ne phir peeche mudakar nahin dekha
 Kohli's blistering 183 runs at the sher-e-bangla National Stadium sparked Pakistan's groundbreaking attack
 ekadivasiy maichon main lakshya kaa peechha karte hue bharat kii yah sabase badi jeet thi
 Kohli made the title he got from Tendulkar worthwhile, in which he called him 'master of the Chase', the mastermind in chasing the target
 bangladesh main kohli kaa yah chauthaa shatak tha
 It will also be interesting to know that during the entire innings of Kohli, the master blaster sat in one place in the dressing room of the team
 pakistan ke khilaaf maichon ke dauraan unke apanaae jane vaale andhvishwaas cricket ke itihaas kii dilachasp kinvadantiyaan ban chuke hai
 Once he bathed the entire time during the match and kept listening to the commentary continuously from Harbhajan Singh

 But this time, in the new poster boy of cricket, his faith in the india-pakistan match venue Mirpur was seen and appreciated
 is dhamaake ke baavjood bhartiya team asia cap ke final main nahin pahunch pai
 But this tournament has already written the story of Kohli turning into a mature and modern cricketer
 bharat kii ekadivasiy team ke nae up-captain kii kamyaabi kii kahani aankade bhi bayaan karte hai
 Kohli averaged 58 runs in 48 innings while chasing the target
 40 rahaa he
 In this, he has scored seven centuries and 13 half-centuries
 tabhi to unhen duniya ke sarvashrashtha ekadivasiy khilaadi kaa tamgaa bhi mil chukaa he
 Mithun Mihas, who played with Kohli in the Delhi Ranji team, is familiar with this steely spirit
 ve kehete hai, ‘uske drudh sankalp par to koi sawaal uthaa hi nahin saktaa
 In December 2006, during a Ranji match against Karnataka in Delhi, Virat's lawyer father Prem Kohli died at 3 am
 pichhali shaam ve noteout rahe the
 Batting the next morning, he postponed his father's funeral to save Delhi from defeat
 mithun bataate hai, ‘viraat ne us samay 90 ran banaae the
 We all asked him if he would like to leave the match and go to the funeral
 He refused straight away and put on a pad
 vah darasal out dene ke ampire ke faisle se naaraaz tha or usase bahes karne ke mood main tha
 Many claim that the incident changed Kohli
 do saal baad kohli ne 19 varsh se kam umr ke vishwacap main bhartiya team ko jeet dilaai or puri tarah cricket main dub gaye
 Former Indian captain Bishan Singh Bedi says, 'he pushed himself into the game
 chamak-damak se dur rahete hue vah sirf cricket kheltaa tha
 Former Indian selector Yashpal Sharma has seen Kohli closely with coach Rajkumar Sharma
 ve maanate hai ki kohli bhartiya cricket ke nae vander bvoy hai: ‘vah ek nae tendulkar jaisaa he
 He can also be called Yuvi or Sehwag without a cut
 uski ballebaaji kii takat gajab kii he
 'kohli is constantly maturing in his game
 or, jaisaa ki purv chayankarta dilip vengsarakar kehete hai ki ballebaaji kii usamen jabardast pratibha he
 However, earlier he used to play shots on the leg side
 maidan ke chaaron ore strokes lagane main khud ko sakasham banaakar ve bhartiya team main madhyakram ke sabase bharosemand ballebaaj ban gaye hai
 Cricket experts have already stamped him as the best batsman in ODI cricket
 cricket ke diwane desh bharat main logon ko unka aakraamak ravaiya or yuva cheharaa pasand he
 Through this, they can easily reach the captaincy chair
 royal chalangers bangaloru ne to unhen ipiel team kaa mascat bana diya he
 It was Kohli who made it to the finals in 2009 and 2010
 or 2011 ke champions lig twanti-20 main team ko final kii raah dikhaai
 For the past three months, his power game has given new life to the Indian cricket team starving for wins and runs
 vigyaapan kii duniya main unka jaadu dikhnaa shuru ho gaya he, jahaan unki keemat bangladesh main hue taaja khel ke baad 3 karod ko paar kar gai he
 The attack is strong and aggressive, Kohli's fund is that this big player of short stature is moving towards the highs in the world of cricket
 viraat ke ran jeet kii guarantee ban gaye hai
 No matter how difficult the situation is, if Virat is at the crease then no tension
 hobort (australia) main 86 gendon par 136 ranon kaa tufaan, mirpur main pehle srilanka or phir pakistan kii dhulaai, ek maheene se bhi kam samay main ek-do nahin, teen badi paariyaan khel chuke hai viraat
 In international cricket, the same player is successful who maintains a series of good performances and wins the match to the team
 donon hi paimaanon par 23 saal ke viraat khare utarate hai
 Under pressure, ordinary players disintegrate, but the big ones grow even more
 viraat duusari shrenee main aate hai, jitne mushkil haalat utani hi damdaar ballebaaji
 In their last league match of the CB Series in Australia, Team India needed a win with a bonus point, Virat came after the initial shock and started raining runs, no one thought that this storm named Virat was ahead Sri Lankan bowlers will become helpless like this
 deth overs main apni yorker gendon ke liye jane jane vaale srilanka ke lasit malinga jaise gendbaaj to dhulaai ke baad ab bhi sadame main hai
 In the same way in the Asia Cup, Pakistan's pace battery went down
 lekin donon hi maukon par final main na pahunchane kii kasak rah gai
 Since winning the World Cup last year, the graph of Team India has been falling down but after seeing the ups and downs of Kohli's graph, it is now moving upwards
 yah sab unke liye itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 Questions were asked only after he was in the probable 11 after a difficult Test series in the West Indies
 england ke daure par bhi nirantarata nahin dikhi
 Although he definitely made a century
 jab west indies bharat aayaa to ek nayaa hi viraat dekhne ko mila, ek aisa ballebaaj jisane apni galatiyon se sabak liya tha or unhen na dohraane kaa drudh nishchay kiya tha
 Virat made the only century in the Test series on Australia tour
 apane shandaar form ke dam par viraat ne asia cap main mirpur ke saath apana rishta or bhi gaharaa kar liya
 Out of the last 4 matches played at Mirpur, he has scored a century in 3
 tabhi to mirpur ko ve apana lucky ground bataate hai, ‘yah ground mere liye special he
 i also like to bat here
 ’ pakistan ke khilaaf balla akasar dagaa de jaataa tha lekin asia cap main ye shikaayat bhi dur ho gai
 He says, 'had to wait against Pakistan
 khushi he ki centuri ke saath yah intjaar bhi khatm hua
 'but Virat's vice-captaincy in the team with Gautam Gambhir? Is it a right decision to give them this responsibility at such a young age? Are the selectors preparing him as a future captain? These were all the questions that Virat answered with his bat
 asia cap main unka dhamal yah bataane ke liye kaaphi he ki ab ve har jimmedaari ke liye khud ko taiyaar kar rahe hai
 He has matured a lot in the last 4 years as a batsman
 unke paas temparament bhi he or takanic bhi
 Be it Australia, England or the Asian subcontinent, Virat is capable of scoring in every condition
 unamem chauke-chakke jadne kaa 'nar he to pari ko sanvaarane kii kaabiliyat bhi
 That is why he is the most successful face of the Young Brigade
 van de main viraat ke banaae gaye 11 shatakon main se 10 main team india jiti he
 Attack is the strength of Virat, so sometimes weakness
 virdohi par jabaani hamale karne hon yaa phir unke celibrasion, unhen surkhiyon main le hi aate hai
 This is the reason why experts advise them to control their aggression
 australian daure par kuch prashansakon ke taana maarane par viraat itnaa bifer gaye the ki maryaada bhi bhul gaye
 How to keep abstinence in such a situation, now this is what Virat has to learn
 ve koshish bhi karte dikhte hai
 In the Asia Cup, he appeared quite relaxed, laughing all the time, joking
 mujic sunanaa or kitaaben padhanaa unhen behad pasand he
 André Agassi's autobiography is the most loved book of Open Virat, being the top tennis player
 team india ke jis bhi ballebaaj ne 183 ran kii pari kheli, vah kaamyaab captain sabit hua
 First Sourav Ganguly and then Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 to kya ve bhi sambhavit safal captainon kii suchi main shaamil hone vaale hai? unke adarsh tendulkar spasht karte hai, ‘ve bahut achche khilaadi hai lekin un par abhi se bahut dabaav nahin daalaa janaa chahie
 'obviously, they will have to do many more tests now
 aditi tyaagi ajtak channel main vishesh samvaadadaata hai
 Often people start feeling sleepy after having lunch
 lekin kya aapane kabhi ye jaanane kii koshish kii he ki aakhir aisa kyon hota he? aaie jaane isaki sahi vajah
 a recent study has shown that after eating lunch, the brain's ability to work slows down
 study main shaamil logon ne is baat kii pushti kii he ki glucose or sugar ke seven ke baad kisi kaary main unke dhyaan or pratikriya main kami aa jaati he
 Some people involved in the study consumed glucose and sugar
 vahiin kuch logon ne fructose or artifishal sweet chizon kaa seven kiya
 After which it was seen that people consuming glucose and sugar were not getting attention in their work as compared to those who consumed fructose
 saath hi kisi cheez par unki pratikriya dene kii kshamta main bhi kami dekhi gai
 This woman cooks by spitting her mouth, watching videos can make you vomit, however, earlier it was said in a study that the intake of glucose improves the ability to remember things
 lekin nai study ne is baat ko galat sabit kar diya he
 The study, published in the journal 'psychology and Behavior', covered about 49 people
 in sabhi logon ne sweet drink kaa seven kiya jisamen glucose, sukroj, fructose shaamil the
 After this, they were given to solve knowledge-related examination
 kya patale logon ke mukaable mote logon ko kam lagati he sardi?parinaamon main saamne aayaa ki jin logon ne glucose or sukroj kaa seven kiya, unhone un logon ke mukaable pariksha main bahut kharaab pradarshan kiya jinhone fructose kaa seven kiya tha

 According to Nandan Nilekani, President of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UID), corruption can be fought more effectively with the help of 'aadhar' than a TV campaign, change in law or deployment of inspectors (lokpal)
 unhone arvind kejariwal kaa naam liye bina unki maangon ko lagbhag nakaar diya
 He said that corruption can be prevented more effectively by the Aadhaar-based service supply chain
 nilekani ne kaha, 'main bhi kisi bhi duusare vyakti kii tarah bhrashtachar se lard rahaa hum or meraa maananaa he ki isaki rokthaam honi chahie
 But i do not believe that the problem of corruption can be solved by passing a law or by deploying more inspectors
 'tivi prasaaran vine se nahin mitega bhrashtacharunhone kaha, 'yah maananaa ki aap kuch tivi prasaaran vine se bhrashtachar mitaa sakate hai, mere khyal se isse bhrashtachar nahin mitane vaala
 i think there is a shortage of people thinking of long-term institutional changes for what we want

 Asaram's son Narayan Sai, wife Laxmi and daughter Bharti are also under attack
 surat police kii taraf se luk out notice jari hua he
 Baba is exposed in prison and the son's misdeeds
 khulaasa narayan sai par hua he
 The same Narayan Sai, who loves to be called Sweetheart Bhagwan
 narayan sai ke naam ladakiyon ke itane lav letters mili hai, sunakar or padhakar koi bhi dang rah jayega
 It was heard that love is God, it was read that there is an unbreakable bond of love between God and devotee
 film bhi bani thi lav ij god par kisi bhagwaan ke liye bhakton kaa aisa prem, aisi izhaare mohabbat, chahat kii roshni main dubo kar likhe gaye bhagwaan ke naam aise prem patr, naa isse pehle kabhi najaron se gujarey, naa hi isse pehle kabhi bhagwaan ke naam likhe gaye aise letters ke bol kaanon se takaraae the
 Many love letters have come in the name of Narayan Sai and by seeing these letters, you will get a sense of their love
 in prem patron main narayan sai ko koi premika unhen sweetheart bulaati he, to koi maai heart, koi shaayari likhti he, to koi gane ke bol likh rahi he, to koi khuleam elaan karti he ki you aar min-ai aam yorse
 Many of his lovers have written - i need you, i want you, i love you
 ek premika to roj bhagavana se phone par baat karnaa chaahati he, yani ab bhagwaan shaayad dilon se nikal kar mobile main ghus gaye hai
 Narayan Sai has a girlfriend, whose love letter, it seems that she has been very close to God
 wo khat main baqayada ek taarikh kaa zikr karti he or likhti he ki ek maheenaa ho gaya mili hue or wo bhagwaan ko miss kar rahi he, jabaki ek duusare lav letters main ek premika likhti he ki plis bhagwaan-ek or cheez jo main chaahati hum, aap jaanate ho
 i will wait for him prem patr main bhagwaan kii khubsuurati se lekar unki khushboo tak kaa zikr he
 Now obviously love does not hide nor fragrance
 lihaaja bhagwaan kii lav story ke lav letters aam ho gaye hai
 That love letter, in which someone is talking about giving life in love, while someone is asking for something special in love
 in prem patron kaa sach aap jaane usase pehle jaruri he ki jaraa ek najar mohabbat bhare in khaton par daal lijie
 After all, there is a love letter written in the name of God
 kuch to diferent hoga
 Why? ”may my love for you and your love grow in me, beyond the cells, never separate from each other
 aapako meri kasam, kabhi mujhase juda yaa naaraaz hue
 Take care to break my oath, i will die
 aap jisko pakad lo, wo kabhi aapako chhod nahin saktaa
 Please do not keep your grip in things and things, but hold me
 plis bhagwaan, ek or cheez jo main chaahati hum main uske liye intjaar karuungi
 'A letter written on 14 February 2005 i am completely incomplete without you, God has been a month today, i miss you very much on this date
 14 janvari ko meraa nayaa janm hua he
 14 January Where i was and where i am today, my mind is deteriorating after thinking
 bas mujhe intjaar he ki wo din dobaaraa kab aaenge
 How crazy i am asking this for my God
 kya karen, mujhe to aapke bina kuch bhi acha nahin lagata he
 God is my life only
 meri saanson main aap, meri ankhon main aap, mere dil main, meri dhadkan main aap, mere to rome-rome main bas gaye ho, kanha aapaki priti main main prem divaani hum
 God, i feel like if you are away from me, then my soul is not with me
 jaise poornima kaa chand dekhakar samudr main tarange uthne lagati he, jowar aa jaataa he

 Seven years have passed since the Commonwealth Games were held in Delhi, but its markings are yet to come
 yah aisi nishaani hai jo tatkaaleen sarkaar kii gadabadiyon or ghotaalon kii yaad dilaati hai, to kuch maujuuda sarkaar kii laaparvaahee or naakaami ko bhi ujagar kar rahi hai
 This may surprise the relationship of the Commonwealth Games to the current government, but it is true that there are some things related to the Commonwealth Games, which after seeing it can be easily said and understood where the current government is She has failed and how she has missed it
 aapako sabase pehle dilli kii life line kahi jane vaali ring road kii kahani bataate hai, jo maujuuda sarkaar kii naakaami ko bayaan karti he
 This is attributed to the work done during the Commonwealth Games
 ashram ke paas lajpat nagar se maharani baag jate vakt sadak par nazar daalenge, to ekadam daayin line main seedbluji 2010 likhaa hua he, jo reserve len kii pahchaan ke liye likhaa gaya tha
 This lane was reserved for movement of players and movement of emergency vehicles
 ring road par bani is len main gaadi chalaane par 2000 rupye kaa chaalaan hota tha
 This information is because even though the rules and fines of this lane have been abolished, but CWG 2010 written as a place of reference on this lane still exists and it is a sign that till now the repair of the roads They have not been remodeled if spoiled
 yah mudda isliye bhi prasangik he kyonki sarkaar sadakon ke gadde bharne kaa daawa kar rahi he, nai sadaken banane or kharaab ho chuki sadakon kii ricarpeting kaa daawa karti he
 But there are only pits on the roads which come under the purview of PWD, in such a situation it can be easily understood that the roads like ring road have not been improved in the last 7 years
 ring road hi kyon dilli kii kai pramukh sadaken jinhen kaamanwealth khelon ke vakt banaaya gaya tha unki sud bhi nahin lee gai he or aaj kai jagahon par yah sadaken buree haalat main hai
 No one from the Delhi government was available to react to the issue, but according to bjp's media head Pravin Shankar Kapoor, this is the failure of the current government and evidence that all the work in Delhi has come to a standstill
 sadakon kii marammat jaise kaam bhi nahin ho paa rahe hai aise main nai sadaken or fliover bananaa kii dur kii baat he

 sarkaar ne is maamle main yachika ko galat dharna par aadhaarit bataaya
 Request Based on Misconception: The Bench of Kendriya Mantriyas Ravindra Bhat and Justice Deepa Sharma was informed, 'the request for grant of' Martyr 'status to the Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) on the lines of Army, Navy and Air Force is based on misconception
 Because this status is not really being given to Army, Navy and Air Force personnel

 is baat se inkaar kiya jaataa he ki siepief ke karmi ko us sammaan se vanchit kiya jaataa he jiskaa ve hakdaar hai
 'chaudhary in his petition has also demanded the government to give equal financial compensation and benefits to the personnel of the paramilitary armed forces on the lines of Army, Navy and Air Force
 is par sarkaar ne kaha, ‘parivaar or kareebi rishtedaaron ko ve hi laabh die jate hai jo rakshakarmiyon ko mayssar hai yani librellised pension awords ke tahat purna paariwarik pension yani antim tankhwaah or unheen dishanirdeshon ke tahat ekamusth kshatipurti jo rakshakarmiyon ke liye maanya he
 The government also denied the petitioner's allegation that martyr status was not being given to the personnel of the indo-tibetan Border Police, who were killed along with five IAF personnel after a helicopter crashed near Gaurikhand in Uttarakhand

 31 oktober ko dilli kaa AQI pahunchaa 427dilli-ncr ke liye maheene kaa sabase jaharila dinsitambar main pichley chaar saalon main sabase svachh hawa main saans lene ke baad dilli waapas phir se oktober main jahrili saanse lene ko majaboor he
 The latest figures released by the CPCB Central Pollution Control Board show that this Thursday (31 October) proved to be the most toxic day of the month for delhi-ncr
 24 ghanton kii ausat ke aankade darshaate hai ki 31 taarikh ko dilli kaa AQI 427 pahunch gaya
 In such a situation, this is the third consecutive day when Delhi's AQI remained above 400
 CPCB ke anusaar aisi hawa 'gambhir' sthiti kii shrenee main aati he or yah biimaar logon ko to pareshaan karti hi he, saath hi saath swasth logon ko bhi bimariyon kii chapet main lekar aa jaati he
 The situation in Delhi was very bad
 India Today's data intelligence unit compared the AQI data for the month of October last year to the data for October of this year
 hamaare vishleshan main yah paaya gaya ki bhale hi dilli main sthiti behad kharaab he, lekin pichley saal kii tulana main oktober ke maheene main dilli kii hawa ke bure din kam hue hai
 In 2018, there were 17 days in October when the air quality was 'bad', ten days 'very poor' and one day 'severe'
 haalanki, dilli main is saal zyada 'gambhir' din dekhne ko mili hai, lekin kharaab or behad kharaab gunvattta vaali hawa main katautee dekhne ko mili he
 This year too, there was not a single day in October when the air quality was 'good' (less than AQI 50), there were two days when the air quality was satisfactory
 (AQI 51 - 100), 8 din thik-thaak / ausat (101 - 200), 14 kharaab (201 -300 AQI), chaar 'behad kharaab' (301 - 400) or teen gambhir (400 + AQI) hawa vaale din dekhne ko mili
 It is worth noting that Diwali, around which the most pollution is spread, occurred eleven days earlier than last year
 pichley saal 2018 main diwali 7 november ko manaai gai thi or is saal 27 oktober ko
 Last year, despite being delayed by 11 days of Diwali, October remained polluted for more days
 oktober ke maheene main jab uttar pashchim bharat ke kisaan fasal badalte hai, tab ve paraali ko jala dete hai jisase hawa main pradooshak bad jate hai
 DIU also found that this time, just a day before Diwali, 1200 cases of stubble burning were registered

 2008 ke mubani hamalon ke baad bharat ne pakistan se cricket khilne se inkaar kar diya tha
 Pakistan will also host four series in the next eight years
 pakistan cricket board ne kaha he ki usne bisisiai se is aashay kaa samjhauta kiya he
 Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) CEO Subhan Ahmed told this to a news agency
 unhone kaha ki pakistan 2015 se 2023 ke bich bharat ke saath 6 siries khelegaa, jisamen se chaar pakistan main hongi
 Last month it was reported that the entire series between the two countries would be played next year

 pakistan chahta he ki pehali siries uski dharti par ho, lekin agar vahaan suraksha intjaam achche nahin rahe to match sanyukt arab emirate main honge
 There has been no international match in Pakistan since the 2009 Sri Lanka Cricket Team players attacked the bus
