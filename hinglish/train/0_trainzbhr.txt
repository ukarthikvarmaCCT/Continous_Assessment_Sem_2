 In fact, IVRCL, which formed the sports village for the Hyderabad National Games in 2002, is badly hit by debts and losses
 company par kareeb 10,000 karod kaa qarj he
 In 2015 December, its loss has been 2000 crores
 company pul ke nirmaan kii lagaat badhwaana chaahati thi
 It is difficult to say whose claims are right and what is wrong, but 25 people have lost their lives due to the fall of the bridge
 kolkata main company ke 8 logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he, lekin agar pul banane main deree kii jimmedaar sarkari athurity hai to unhen bhi baksha nahin janaa chahie
 The comments ab aate hai aaj ke sawaal par
 Are flyovers so important that we make them anywhere
 desh bhar main fliover ko dekhenge to aapako aise bahut se fliover milenge to dhang ke bane hon
 Seeing some flyovers in small towns makes one nervous
 har jagah trephic jam kii samasya badhati ja rahi he
 Leaders also lay the foundation of the plyover to reassure the people
 dilli main jahaan pichley das-pandrah saalon main sau ke kareeb fliover to bane hi honge
 i can tell from the experience of this city that some flyovers seem successful but even after the formation of most flyovers, the problem of jam does not end
 mumbai main 50 fliover banane kii baat do dashak se chal rahi he
 There are 40 flyovers in Bengaluru
 chennai main bhi khub fliover bane hai
 You keep looking at the photographs of the foundation and inauguration of the flyover in newspapers every day, but have you ever seen whether they will solve the problem of traffic or not
 trephic ke alaava yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki fliover kii vajah se aasapaas kii saamaajik vyavastha bhi prabhavit hoti he
 The environment will also be affected
 kya aapako bhi lagata he ki fliover aane ke baad se trephic jam kii samasya samaapt ho gai he
 In my own experience both these things are there
 agar dilli ke sarai kaale khan se trephic kaa hal nahin hua he to gajipur fliover banane se kaaphi kuch hal hua he
 Like a dry drain, this flyover adjoining the houses on both sides is flowing, Badrang, Benur and Bedrang
 dizine dekhakar lagata he bharat main ejineering or dizine kii padhai band ho gai he
 Neither understanding nor imagination can be seen
 is pul ko banane se pehle yah tak nahin sochaa gaya ki aasapaas ke makaanon or logon ke jivan par kya asar padegaa
 All these houses are sixty to seventy years old
 inke bich se do kilometre lanbaa pul gujaarne kaa khyaal kis mahaan vaigyanik kaa tha use hajir kiya janaa chahie
 The bridge is passing by touching the houses here
 itane kareeb se ki aap scale se naap sakate hai
 There is not even a foot difference
 koi ejineering fail hoga tab bhi aisi dizine nahin banayega
 Will keep a difference of at least five to six feet
 yahaan ke makaanon ke itane kareeb se guzar rahaa he ki khidkiyaan bhi nahin khul sakati hai
 Now tell me, if this bridge were built, what would be the impact on the houses here
 pul ke kampan se makaanon par kya asar padataa
 Which engineering college in the world is taught such a design that make a bridge or highway close to the window of the house
 kya yah sirf hindustan main ho saktaa he? kya yah sirf kolkata main ho saktaa he? pul nahin bhi girtaa to banane ke baad is pul par isse sate makaan gir jate
 People have also been sued
 vyapaariyon ne bhi iskaa virodh hi kiya he
 From the Left to the Trinamool Government, it must take responsibility for the bizarre and dangerous design of this bridge
 yah fliover kolkata ke kisi kone yaa kinare main nahin ban rahaa tha balki behad mahatvapurn jagah he
 There are hospitals around, coaching institutes, fruit and flower markets
 pushta main ise khatm hona tha jahaan kaaphi bada makaan he
 People there also have to test how they organize and fight their battles
 darasal log ladate hai magar vyavasthaaen unhen haraa hi detii hai
 Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee sat on the scene from noon to one o'clock on Thursday, monitoring the rescue work
 tamaam afasar maujuud the
 It is commendable to look at the aftermath of the incident that Mamata Banerjee is sitting on the road watching all the work but if she showed the same activity to the complaints related to it before the bridge collapsed, then this incident would not have been averted
 kya mamata banerjee yaa pul banane vaala vibhaag isaki dizine ko lekar puri tarah aashwast tha

 An investigation into why the bridge fell has started and Kolkata Police has reached Hyderabad
 itane bade-bade kaarobaaron se jude rahane ke baad bhi haadase ke baad is company kaa bayaan aata he ki yah 'act aaf god' he
 The bridge itself has destroyed the temple of God
 god to nahin magar godes kaali ke mandir kaa baramada bhi gir gaya he is naamuraad pul ke girane se
 This statement of the company has drawn much criticism in the human world
 god kii taraf se apane act par safai to nahin ai magar god ko is act main lapetane vaali company ne hyderabad main safai di ki ho saktaa he ki dhamaakaa hua ho

 The comments ab aate hai aaj ke sawaal par
 Are flyovers so important that we make them anywhere
 desh bhar main fliover ko dekhenge to aapako aise bahut se fliover milenge to dhang ke bane hon
 Seeing some flyovers in small towns makes one nervous
 har jagah trephic jam kii samasya badhati ja rahi he

 dilli main jahaan pichley das-pandrah saalon main sau ke kareeb fliover to bane hi honge
 i can tell from the experience of this city that some flyovers seem successful but even after the formation of most flyovers, the problem of jam does not end
 mumbai main 50 fliover banane kii baat do dashak se chal rahi he
 There are 40 flyovers in Bengaluru
 chennai main bhi khub fliover bane hai
 You keep looking at the photographs of the foundation and inauguration of the flyover in newspapers every day, but have you ever seen whether they will solve the problem of traffic or not
 trephic ke alaava yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki fliover kii vajah se aasapaas kii saamaajik vyavastha bhi prabhavit hoti he
 The environment will also be affected
 kya aapako bhi lagata he ki fliover aane ke baad se trephic jam kii samasya samaapt ho gai he
 In my own experience both these things are there
 agar dilli ke sarai kaale khan se trephic kaa hal nahin hua he to gajipur fliover banane se kaaphi kuch hal hua he
 This flyover was not being built in any corner or side of Kolkata but is a very important place
 aasapaas aspataal hai, koching santhaan hai, fal or phool kii mandi he
 It was to end in Pushta where there is a very big house
 vahaan ke logon kaa bhi imtahaan he ki ve kaise sangathit hokar apni ladaai ladate hai
 Actually people fight but the systems beat them
 mukhyamantri mamata banerjee guuruuvaar ko dopaher se lekar raat ke ek baje tak ghatnasthal par baithkar bachaav kaary kii nigaraanee karti raheen
 All officers were present
 ghatana ke baad kii najar se dekhen to saraahneey he ki mamata banerjee sadak par baithkar sara kaam dekh rahi hai lekin yahi sakriyata pul girane se pehle ve isse judi shikayaton ke prati dikhaatin to kya yah haadasa tal nahin jaataa
 Was Mamata Banerjee or the bridge-making department fully confident of its design
 unhone to vaada kiya tha ki pul jaldi banegaa lekin kya unhone dhyaan diya tha ki pul ko lekar unke hi saansad or sthaneey log kya shikaayat kar rahe the? Now come to company inkaa naam he IVRCL
 The company is headquartered in Hyderabad
 iske paas 3000 ejeeniyar hai
 It has such a large army of engineers
 company ne apni site par likhaa he ki yah JNNURM kaa yah sabase mushkil project he
 The structure is entirely steel
 25 saal puraani yah company kai tarah ke kaarobaar se judi he
 It has many businesses including water and environment, irrigation, transportation, building and industrial structures, power supply, mining maintenance
 company neshnal stock exange or bisai main listed bhi he
 The company has contracts in Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra to Karnataka
 pul kyon gira isaki jaanch shuru ho gai he or kolkata kii police hyderabad pahunch gai he
 Even after being associated with such a big business, after the accident, the statement of this company comes that it is 'act of God'
 pul ke girane se khud god kaa mandir dhwast ho gaya he
 Not God but the verandah of Goddess Kali's temple has also fallen due to the fall of this nominal bridge
 company ke is bayaan kii insaanon kii duniya main kaaphi aalochana hui he
 God did not come clean on his act, but the company that wrapped God in this act gave a clarification in Hyderabad that there may have been a blast
 shishe toote hai
 The company was given the first deadline of 18 months to build this bridge
 67 maheene biit gaye
 While the IVRCL company blames the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority for not delaying the delay for the delay, the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority alleges that the company is working too slowly
 lekin abhi aarope kya he
 The allegation is not why the bridge took so long to be built
 aarope yah he ki pul kaa saath meter kaa hissaa kaise gir gaya
 How did that new part fall? darasal 2002 main hyderabad neshnal games ke liye sports village banane vaali IVRCL karzon or nuksaan se buree tarah ghiri hui he
 The company has a debt of about 10,000 crores
 2015 disambar main iskaa ghaataa 2000 karod kaa ho gaya he
 The company wanted to increase the cost of construction of the bridge
 kiskaa daawa sahi-sahi or kiskaa galat yah kahana mushkil he lekin pul girane se 25 logon ko apni jaan jarur ganvaani padi he
 8 people of the company have been arrested in Kolkata, but they should not be spared if there is a government authority responsible for delay in construction of the bridge
 tippaniyan Now come to today's question
 kya fliover itane jaruri hai ki ham kahin bhi kaise bhi bana dete hai
 If you look at flyovers across the country, then you will get many such flyovers, if made of style
 chote shaharon main kuch fliowaron ko dekhakar to ji ghabara hi jaataa he
 The problem of traffic jams is increasing everywhere
 netaa bhi logon ko aashwast karne ke liye pliover kii aadharshila rakh dete hai
 In Delhi, in the last ten-fifteen years, close to a hundred flyovers would have been built
 is shahar ke anubhav se bataa saktaa hum ki kuch fliover to kaamyaab lagate hai lekin zyaadaatar fliover ke banane ke baad bhi jam kii samasya samaapt nahin hoti he
 Talk of building 50 flyovers in Mumbai has been going on for two decades
 bengalooru main 40 fliover ban gaye hai
 There are also plenty of flyovers in Chennai
 aae din akhabaaron main fliover ke shilanyas or udghaatan kii tasviren aap dekhte rahete hai lekin kya kabhi dekha he ki inase trephic kii samasya dur hoti bhi he yaa nahin
 Apart from traffic, it is also said that the flyover also affects the surrounding social system
 paryaavaran par bhi asar hota hi hoga
 Do you also think that the traffic jam problem has ended since the flyover came
 mere khud ke anubhav main to donon hi baaten hai
 If traffic has not been resolved from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi, then the Ghazipur flyover has solved a lot
 ab aate hai company ji par

 aarope yah he ki pul kaa saath meter kaa hissaa kaise gir gaya
 How did that new part fall? darasal 2002 main hyderabad neshnal games ke liye sports village banane vaali IVRCL karzon or nuksaan se buree tarah ghiri hui he
 The company has a debt of about 10,000 crores
 2015 disambar main iskaa ghaataa 2000 karod kaa ho gaya he
 The company wanted to increase the cost of construction of the bridge
 kiskaa daawa sahi-sahi or kiskaa galat yah kahana mushkil he lekin pul girane se 25 logon ko apni jaan jarur ganvaani padi he
 8 people of the company have been arrested in Kolkata, but they should not be spared if there is a government authority responsible for delay in construction of the bridge
 tippaniyan Now come to today's question
 kya fliover itane jaruri hai ki ham kahin bhi kaise bhi bana dete hai
 If you look at flyovers across the country, then you will get many such flyovers, if made of style
 chote shaharon main kuch fliowaron ko dekhakar to ji ghabara hi jaataa he
 The problem of traffic jams is increasing everywhere
 netaa bhi logon ko aashwast karne ke liye pliover kii aadharshila rakh dete hai
 In Delhi, in the last ten-fifteen years, close to a hundred flyovers would have been built
 is shahar ke anubhav se bataa saktaa hum ki kuch fliover to kaamyaab lagate hai lekin zyaadaatar fliover ke banane ke baad bhi jam kii samasya samaapt nahin hoti he
 Talk of building 50 flyovers in Mumbai has been going on for two decades
 bengalooru main 40 fliover ban gaye hai
 There are also plenty of flyovers in Chennai
 aae din akhabaaron main fliover ke shilanyas or udghaatan kii tasviren aap dekhte rahete hai lekin kya kabhi dekha he ki inase trephic kii samasya dur hoti bhi he yaa nahin
 Apart from traffic, it is also said that the flyover also affects the surrounding social system
 paryaavaran par bhi asar hota hi hoga
 Do you also think that the traffic jam problem has ended since the flyover came
 mere khud ke anubhav main to donon hi baaten hai
 If traffic has not been resolved from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi, then the Ghazipur flyover has solved a lot

 ab aate hai aaj ke sawaal par
 Are flyovers so important that we make them anywhere
 desh bhar main fliover ko dekhenge to aapako aise bahut se fliover milenge to dhang ke bane hon
 Seeing some flyovers in small towns makes one nervous
 har jagah trephic jam kii samasya badhati ja rahi he
 Leaders also lay the foundation of the plyover to reassure the people
 dilli main jahaan pichley das-pandrah saalon main sau ke kareeb fliover to bane hi honge
 i can tell from the experience of this city that some flyovers seem successful but even after the formation of most flyovers, the problem of jam does not end
 mumbai main 50 fliover banane kii baat do dashak se chal rahi he
 There are 40 flyovers in Bengaluru
 chennai main bhi khub fliover bane hai
 You keep looking at the photographs of the foundation and inauguration of the flyover in newspapers every day, but have you ever seen whether they will solve the problem of traffic or not
 trephic ke alaava yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki fliover kii vajah se aasapaas kii saamaajik vyavastha bhi prabhavit hoti he
 The environment will also be affected
 kya aapako bhi lagata he ki fliover aane ke baad se trephic jam kii samasya samaapt ho gai he
 In my own experience both these things are there
 agar dilli ke sarai kaale khan se trephic kaa hal nahin hua he to gajipur fliover banane se kaaphi kuch hal hua he
 Apart from traffic, it is also said that the flyover also affects the surrounding social system
 paryaavaran par bhi asar hota hi hoga
 Do you also think that the traffic jam problem has ended since the flyover came
 mere khud ke anubhav main to donon hi baaten hai

 ) notebandi ke faisle par mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa aglaa rukh kya hoga? yah ek aisa sawaal he jiskaa jawaab kisi ko maaloom nahin, lekin sab log is mudde par kayaas laga rahe hai
 As far as Bihar Chief Minister and Janata Dal (united) President Nitish Kumar is concerned, he has made it clear that if you are waiting for an answer on 31 December, you will feel disappointed
 haa lekin notebandi par ve apni party ke netaaon se vichaar vimarsh karenge or jarurat padi to arthshaastriyon kii bhi raay lenge
 But before that, his first priority is to successfully organize the Prakash Utsav and the festival of followers of Buddhism on the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Govind Singh in Bihar
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki in donon mahatvapurn aayojanon kaa samaapan 13 janvari tak ho paaegaa
 Only after this, Nitish Kumar's new stance on demonetisation will be known
 haalanki nitish kumaar ne philhal apni rajnatik pratidwandi party bijepi or satta main sahyogi notebandi ke ghor virdohi rashtriya janata dal va congress ko spasht kar diya he ki ve kisi dabaav main is mudde par apane kadam ko lekar punarvichaar nahin karne vaale hai, isliye notebandi kaa saidhantik samarthan jahaan kaayam he vahiin iske kriyanvayan ko lekar saarvajanik manchon se sawaal bhi jari hai
 On Monday, Nitish Kumar also bluntly rejected the Center's cashless economy on the grounds that it was contrary to Indian culture and mood
 darasal nitish maatra media kii khabaron ke aadhaar par is mudde par apane kadam par pherbadal nahin karnaa chaahate kyonki unhen maaloom he ki logon ko dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 The laborers of Bihar are forced to return to their villages
 
 Development work has been adversely affected
 lekin iske baavjood janata main aakrosh nahin he
 Even if angry, they are not agitated
 notebandi ke kaaran bihar main kahin bhi kanoon-vyavastha kii samasya dekhne ko nahin mili
 It is also a coincidence that since the announcement of demonetisation Nitish Kumar has been roaming in various districts of Bihar in connection with his decision journey
 unhen ab tak janata main asantosh or aakrosh kii koi ek bhi aisi ghatana nahin dekhne mili jisase ve apane nirnay par punarvichaar karne ke liye majaboor hon
 And if the problems of the people have increased and the work has stopped, then it is a cause of concern for the leaders and workers of the Bharatiya Janata Party more than Nitish because they have to bear the brunt
 philhal janata dal (you) ke netaaon kaa akalan yahi he ki dhire-dhire logon kii samasya kam ho rahi he or garib vanchit logon kaa tabaka bade logon kii pareshaani se khush he
 Nitish Kumar has discomfort among his colleagues from the stand
 congress nitish kumaar ke swabhaav se parichit ho na ho lekin lalu yadav ko maaloom he ki nitish kumaar par dabaab daalkar unka stand badalawaanaa aasaan nahin he
 However, Lalu Yadav has certainly been able to strengthen his relations with the Congress party due to Nitish Kumar's stand on demonetisation and at the same time his penetration in the Muslim community has also strengthened
 nitish jaanate hai ki muslim samudaay har mudde par pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf aakraamak rukh kii apeksha rakhata he jise puraa kar paanaa sambhav nahin
 Nitish will also refrain from raising the flag of protest to keep only one section of the people happy on every issue because he realizes the ground truth that it also has a counter-polarization that is responsible for all the failures and promises of the Bharatiya Janata Party Failure to complete may cover the failure
 tippaniyan Nitish's stance on demonetisation is being speculated by linking softness to his future political reconciliation, but political experts believe that even when Nitish Kumar was running the government with BJP, he avoided avoiding fencing on every issue with Congress

 At the same time, he supported Pranab Mukherjee on the issue of presidential election
 lekin uskaa matlab yah nahin tha ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress party se janata dal (you) ke saath unka koi talmail tha
 Nitish knows that credibility is a big capital in politics and he has the capital to take a stand on work and political issues besides his image
 nitish jo bhi kadam uthaaen, unhen maaloom he ki centre ko benami sampatti ke khilaaf karrvaai kii unki maang par aaj nahin to kal kadam uthaanaa padegaa or iskaa shrey unhen hi jayega
 Apart from this, during his 11 years of rule in Bihar, several steps were taken against corruption, such as seizing the houses of corrupt officials and opening schools there

 Now they must be feeling that if the Modi government is serious against corruption, then Bihar model will have to be adopted sooner and maybe this will be the real proof of their move on the issue of demonetisation

 nitish kumaar ke stand se unke sahyogiyon main bechaini he
 Congress may not be familiar with the nature of Nitish Kumar, but Lalu Yadav knows that it is not easy to change his stand by putting pressure on Nitish Kumar
 haalanki lalu yadav nishchit rup se nitish kumaar ke notebandi par samarthan ke rukh ke kaaran congress party se apane sambandh madhur karne main safal rahe hai or saath hi muslim samudaay main bhi unki paith or majboot hui he
 Nitish knows that the Muslim community expects an aggressive stand against Prime Minister Narendra Modi on every issue, which is not possible to fulfill
 nitish har mudde par keval ek varg ke logon ko khush rakhane ke liye virodh kaa jhanda uthaane se isliye bhi parhez karenge kyonki unhen is jamini sach kaa bhaleebhanti ahsaas he ki iskaa ek counter dhruvikaran bhi hota he jo bhartiya janata party kii sari naakaami or vaadon ko puraa na karne kii vifaltaa ko dhank saktaa he
 The comments notebandi par nitish ke rukh main narmi ko unke bhavishya ke raajnneetik melmilaap se jodakar atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai lekin raajnneeti ke jaankaar maanate hai ki nitish kumaar jab bijepi ke saath sarkaar chalaa rahe the tab bhi congress ke saath har mudde par talwarbaji karne se parhez karte the
 So when BJP was opposing GST, they were in support of it
 vahiin raashtrapati chunaav ke mudde par unhone pranab mukherjee kaa samarthan kiya tha
 But that did not mean that he had any rapport with the Janata Dal (U) from the Congress party in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 nitish jaanate hai ki raajnneeti main vishwasaneeyata ek badi puunji hoti he or unke paas apni chhavi ke alaava kaamkaaj or rajnatik muddon par stand lene kii hi puunji he
 Whatever steps Nitish takes, they know that the Center will have to take action on their demand for action against benami property, if not today, tomorrow and the credit will go to them
 iske alaava bihar main apane 11 varshon ke shasankaal main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ek se ek kai kadam uthaae gaye, jaise bhrasht adhikariyon ke ghar jabt kar usamen skool kholana
 However, due to lack of marketing, these things remained limited in Bihar
 ab unhen lag rahaa hoga ki agar modi sarkaar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf gambhir he to bihar model ko der saber apnaanaa hoga or shaayad yah notebandi ke mudde par unke kadam kaa asal pramaan hoga

 There is an atmosphere of fear among parents of children studying in Delhi and NCR schools
 logon ke man main dar he ki kahin unke bachche ke saath kuch galat naa ho jaae
 The team of 'aaj Tak' has also investigated several schools in Delhi, it came out from this investigation that the trust of the parents has started to rise from the schools

 Both gates are opened during school leave and one can easily enter the school without investigation
 abhibhavakon kaa kahana he ki yah hamaare bacchon kii suraksha ke saath khilwaad he
 Private vehicles bring children The biggest negligence observed in schools was in the vehicles used to transport children
 bacchon ko rozaana lekar jane vaali taxi privet number kii hai
 According to the rule, trains carrying children from school should have a commercial registration and number as private number trains are not official and there is no investigation of those trains
 jabaki commercial gadiyon kii har saal jaanch hoti or fitness test hota he
 But in this case, parents should also take care because they send their children in these private vehicles
 padtaal se saaf jaahir he ki skulon main bacchon kii suraksha ke saath khilwaad ho rahaa he
 Now a painful accident has occurred, everyone's attention has gone to all these points, but such accidents happen every day

 In big tournaments, Dhoni bets only on old players instead of new ones
 jaahir he, unhone manish pandey kii jagah rahane ke saath hi janaa behatar samajha
 While Pandey, who played a key role in defeating the IPL and recently Australia in the only one-day, did not get the support of the captain
 duusari ore australia main bench par hi baithe rahane vaale or team sangyojan main feet nahin baithne vaale harbhajan ko team main jagah di gai he, isaki sabase badi vajah captain hi hai, kyonki unako bhajji par bharosa he

 Remember that due to this attitude, Ashish Nehra stayed away from the 'national' cap for five years, while he was brilliant in the IPL and also recovered from injury
 kya irfan jaisi pratibha ko bhi itani hi pratiksha kerani hogi? tippaniyan In this way, we find that the selectors and captain have chosen a defensive team

 He tried to reach out to the migrant voters by referring to the development work done in Delhi in the last 15 years and the UPA Government's ambitious Food Security Bill
 dilli kii jansankhya kaa kareeb ek tihaai pravasi matadaata hai
 In a message to people who settled in Delhi in search of work and employment, especially from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, Rahul said, 'those who come from outside, we put their hands in their hands and go ahead with them
 ’pradesh main vikaas kaaryon ke liye dilli kii mukhyamantri shila dikshit kii tarif karte hue congress upaadhyaksh rahul ne vikaas ke muddon kii andekhi ke liye vipaksh kii ninda kii
 Rahul Gandhi in his speech on Sunday made no mention of the controversy over his statement that the ISI had approached Muslim youths in riot-hit Muzaffarnagar
 rahul kii dilli raily ke saath hi gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi patna main sabha ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 Modi had targeted Rahul at a Jhansi rally saying that he should either reveal the names of Muslim youths or publicly apologize for his statement
 metro or airport ke liye thapthapai sarkaar kii peendilli ke muddon par kendrit rahe rahul gandhi ne kaha ki dilli ke metro ke model ko indonesia jaise duusare deshon main bhi apanaaya ja rahaa he
 The UPA government has given Delhiites a shining world-class airport
 congress mahasachiv shakeel ahamed ne bhi rahul ke sur main sur milaate hue kaha ki dilli main na keval bihar or purvi uttar pradesh ke balki anya rajyon ke log bhi aakar rahete hai, jabaki bijepi ne shivasena se naata jod rakhaa he or uski nazdikiyaan raaj thakare se bhi hai jo maharashtra main hindi bhashi logon ko nishaanaa banaate rahe hai

 vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha he ki bhartiya rigerv bank ke paas paryaapt nakadi he, jo 30 disambar ke baad bhi uplabdh rahegi
 But was the situation the same on the day of the announcement of demonetisation i
e
 8 November? In reality, the ratio of new notes that day is less than one-fourth of the canceled notes, ie 24
 11% hi tha
 Not only this, according to information received from the Right to Information, RBI did not have a new note of 500 on that day
 vittamantri ne kaha he ki "puri taiyaari ke saath yah faisla liya gaya tha
 Not a single day happened after the announcement of demonetisation, on which the RBI did not supply sufficient funds through the banking system
 " lekin jo aankade aae hai unhen dekhakar lagata he ki notebandi ke dauraan bank or atm ke baahar lambii qatari kaa jimmedaar rigerv bank bhi he
 According to the documents received from RTI, on November 8, the Reserve Bank of India had a total of 23,93,753 of 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 rupees
 39 karod ke note uplabdh the, jisamen 500 rupee kaa ek bhi nayaa note rigerv bank main maujuud nahin tha
 According to RTI activist Anil Galgali, the old stock was in the currency of about 24 lakh crore rupees, in which the value of 500-1000 rupee notes was 21 lakh crores, due to which people suffered a lot
 raddi noton ke aivaz main 2000 ke nae chape noton kaa mulya 4
 95 lakh crores
 yani kahin na kahin lagbhag dedh maheene baad bhi agar qatari choti nahin ho rahi to uski badi vajah badintjami bhi he
 It is clear from the data from RTI that neither the entire situation was assessed nor the appropriate measures taken before taking such a big step towards the economy
 artiai kaaryakarta anil galgali ke mutabik jo purana stock tha usamen kareeb 24 lakh karod rupee kii karency uplabdh thi jisamen 500-1000 rupee ke noton kii keemat 21 lakh karod thi jisaki vajah se logon kii bahut takalif hui
 The value of 2000 new printed notes for scrap notes 4
 95 lakh karod tha
 That is, even after about one and a half months, if the queue is not getting short, then its big reason is bad luck
 artiai se mili aankadon se saaf he ki arthvyavastha ko lekar itnaa bada kadam uthaane se pehle na to puri sthiti kaa akalan kiya gaya or na hi samuchit upaay

 In fact, Mayawati's BSP and Akhilesh Yadav's SP have decided to contest simultaneously in the Lok Sabha elections 2019, which will be formally announced today in Lucknow on Saturday
 sutron kii maane to sapa-basapa gathbandhan par unka kahana he ki rajya main bijepi ko jeet se rokane liye donon ne gathbandh kiya he
 Although there was talk of an alliance between BSP-SP and Congress in UP earlier, but a few days ago a meeting between Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav in Delhi indicated that there would be an alliance between SP and BSP in the state and the Congress It will not be included
 haalanki, sutron ne yah bhi jaankaree di he ki sapa-basapa gathbandhan main agar congress do siton par maan jaati he to use saath rakhaa jayega
 If the Congress party stays out of the alliance, then Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that it warned of the consequences
 congress pravaktaa abhishek manu singhvi ne kaha, main yah spasht kar duun ki samaan vichaar vaali sabhi partiyon kaa uddeshy congress kii tarah yahi he ki is desh se kushasan hataaya jaae, taanaashaahee ko hataaya jaae
 It all has the same purpose
 hamen is uddeshy ke liye kaam karnaa he
 He further said that it is the responsibility of every party to keep pace with that result and ensure it
 is tarah kii har party kii aisa karne ke liye patibaddh he
 Those who do not do so will be blamed by the public
 unhone aage kaha ki unki party ko kamatar nahin aanka janaa chahie
 He also claimed that the Congress has presence and base in Uttar Pradesh
 darasal, enditivi se sutron ne kaha ki uttar pradesh kii ye donon badi partiyaan yani sapa-basapa 37-37 loksabhaa siton par saath milakar chunaav ladengi
 Uttar Pradesh has a total of 80 Lok Sabha seats
 basapa-sapa gathbandhan main amethi or raibareli kii siten chhod di jaaengi or vahaan kisi bhi ummidavaar ko nahin utaara jayega
 The SP-BSP has left both these seats for the Congress
 uttar pradesh main congress ko apni pahunch, upasthiti or samarthan ke aadhaar par kisi ko bhi kam nahin aankna chahie
 The Congress is an established party in the state
 
 
 ham mushkil samay main gir sakate hai, magar hamen nazarandaaj karnaa ek khatarnaak bhul (galati) hogi
 Let me tell you that Akhilesh Yadav told NDTV that he will not say anything on whether the Congress will join the SP-BSP alliance, but it definitely said that he is ready to give up two seats for the Congress in UP
 isse pehle patni dimple yadav ke sansadeey kshetra kannauj main enditivi se exclusive baatcheet ke dauraan akhilesh yadav ne upi main ban rahe is gathbandhan main congress ko saath lene ke sawaal par kaha ki congress ke bare main kuch nahin kah saktaa
 Congress is the national party
 upi main congress party ke netaa hai
 But the way in which the alliance will, or will not, be difficult to say
 kya dil se yah chahenge ki congress bhi saath aa jaae ? is sawaal par unhone kaha ki aaj is par isliye nahin boluungaa ki kal kaa ahm din he
 The alliance is to be announced tomorrow
 gathbandhan kii baat pehle ho jaae, tab kuch kahuunga
 i agree that one should not be too hasty
 baad main sochenge ki aage kaise rasta nikalegaa
 Is this a mismatch alliance? Or have you come together because of Modi Hate? Answering this question, Akhilesh said that no one can say this
 ham basapa se ladate jarur hai
 But relations were not bad
 mere to katai nahin
 He said that we will increase our vote after learning from BJP

 sabase dilachasp baat ye he ki in teenon ne hi pradhanmantri modi par kitaab likhi he
 Rajdeep Sardesai said that now we are becoming more journalists and less politicians
 ham agar patrkaar hai to hamen kisi bhi vyakti ke bare main puri jaankaree sabake saamne rakhni chahie chaahe wo galat ho yaa sahi
 Uday Mahurkar said that this government is doing well
 sarkaar galati bhi karegi aisa bhi sambhav he jaise, blike mani ek bada ection he lekin isaki puri planning nahin kii gai

 About Ghalib, he said that Ghalib is not an ordinary human being

 Recalling his childhood days, he said that i was the only person in my family who saw ten thousand rupees
 anupam kherne aage baat karte hue kaha ki logon ko hansaana bahut mushkil he
 Our country is going to go far ahead, all we need is to be one among ourselves
 hamaare pradhanmantri bahut acha kaam kar rahe hai or hamen unke saath khadey hone kii jarurat he
 Today the whole world stands with us after the surgical strike
 hamen apni deshbhakti dikhaane main koi shame nahin aani chahie
 If we feel something, it is very important to tell it
 agar main acting ke bare main hi baat karun to agar main apane kirdaar ko parde par sho na karun to aapako kaise pataa chalegaa ki meraa kirdaar kya he
 Therefore, there should be no fear in expressing emotions
 mujhe asafalataa se dar nahin lagata bas sehat thik rahani chahie

 aaj tak ke saahitiyik mahakumbh main kuch is tarah najar aae anupam The poem 'most dangerous happens' by the Punjabi poet Avtar Singh Pash has now been read and repeated so many times that it is feared that it may not have lost its meaning
 lekin har baar halaat kuch aise hote hai ki is kavita ko uddhrut karne kii ichha hoti he
 These days, peace is being expressed in the country on maintaining 'peace'
 sab yaad dilaa rahe hai ki jammu-kashmir main dhara 370 hataae jane ke baad bhi hinsa nahin hui or ayodhya kaa faisalaa aane ke baad bhi desh main aman bana rahaa
 What is this information about? Is it that the common people have increased confidence in the government and its justice? Or that most of the citizens are terrorized by the aggressive attitude of majoritarianism and they are currently forced to bear such injustice
 Isn't this the 'dead peace' that the loop had topped the list of the most dangerous things? Is the dream of a just system within us dying out? After removing Article 370 in Kashmir, the government is patting itself on the back that there was no violence there
 lekin teen maheene hone ja rahe hai- kashmir ko bahut saare logon ke liye jaise kisi jailkhane main badal diya gaya he
 There are three former chief ministers of the state - Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti arrested
 sarkaar ko andeshaa he ki agar in logon kii rihaai hui to kashmir main maahaul karaab hoga
 Apart from these, many other people including leaders of different parties have also been arrested
 jo bahut maamuli si suvidhaayen hai, unki aadhi-adhuri bahaali ko sarkaar apni uplabdhi kii tarah pesh kar rahi he
 Opening schools, running trains, starting telephone lines, starting postpaid services - all these are the minimum things that can be counted as absolutely basic needs in any state
 internet aaj ke samay kii bilkul buniyadi jarurat he, lekin kashmir ke log sau din se isse vanchit hai
 Kashmir is not free to boil over it
 vahaan lakhon kii taadaad main surakshakarmi tainaat hai
 There is something similar in the colonies
 lekin baaqi bharat ko kya ho gaya he? jo bharat kashmir se mohabbat kaa daawa karata he, kya uske bheetar kashmiriyon se ghrinaa bhari hui he? agar nahin to vah unke moulik adhikaron kii bahaali kii maang kyon nahin karata? jo bharat vahaan jameen kharidne kaa, vahaan kii ladakiyon se shaadi karne kaa sapana dekhtaa he, kya vah bilkul aattaayi or aakrantha kii tarah vahaan daakhil hona chahta he yaa apane hi kisi aise pradesh kii tarah, jahaan uskaa dil se swaagat ho? jis bharat main kashmir ko chunavi mudda banaaya jaataa ho, vahaan kashmir ke raajnneetikaran ko lekar koi samvednaa kyon nahin jaagti? aisa kyon lagata he ki kashmir ke prati samvedansheel dhang se baat karne vaale kisi bhi shaks ko deshadrohi tehra diya ja saktaa he? yah andeshaa kyon hota he ki agar ham kashmir main band internet kii baat karen, vahaan jelon main band logon kii baat karen to hamen sarkaar kaa hi nahin, apni hi ek badi aabaadi kaa tikhaa virodh jhelana padegaa?yahi sthiti ayodhya par aae faisale kii he
 This decision is also full of contradictions in its judicial implications
 is antarvirodh ke kam se kam chaar str hai
 First, that no claim on the disputed land could be finally proved, but even then the court gave it to a party
 doosraa yah ki zamin usee paksh kaa mandir banane ke naam par gai jiske pratinidhiyon ne nyaayalay ke hi mutabik 1949 main chupake se murti rakhane kaa or 1992 main saream masjid giraane kaa avaidh kaam kiya
 He was not punished for this work, he received the award
 teesri baat yah ki vivaadit zamin sarkaar ne maangi nahin thi
 She could have asked but no such application was received from her
 tab bhi adaalat ne sarkaar ko zamin saunp di
 Fourthly, the court has also decided what the government will do there - that is, build a temple through trust
 jabaki shuru main vidwaan jajon ne kaha tha ki ve khud ko zamin kii milkiyat ke vivaad tak simit rakhenge
 This decision has social consequences and gloom
 jin logon ko ram mandir andolan ke jalte hue din yaad honge, unhen yaad hoga ki is andolan ne desh bhar main kaise dangon ko janm diya tha
 We are finding that till yesterday, those who were speaking the language of the rioters, they became the worshipers of peace
 jin logon ne teen dashak tak kaha ki adaalatein aasthaa kaa faisalaa nahin kar saktin, ve achaanak supreme court ke faisale ke prati aasthavan ho uthe
 all the more
 jo log sabarimala par supreme court kaa faisla maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai, ve ayodhya par yahi faisalaa maanane kii apil kar rahe hai
 While this relief within the minority groups is great that this time they have not suffered any riots
 agar faisalaa kuch or aata to aman-chaiyn kii tasviir shaayad yah nahin rahati
 The situation is that those who want to try their last legal option through a review petition on the decision of the Supreme Court, are also being called enemies of peace
 dhyaan se dekhie to yahi log hai jo teesri jagah maamuli se shantibhang se baukhala uthe hai
 They are also troubled by the agitation by JNU students in Delhi on the issue of fee hike
 jeenyu ke chaatr sadak par lathi kha rahe hai, ghaseet kar hataae ja rahe hai, lekin sabko lag rahaa he ki fees badhotaree kaa virodh jaise koi ayyashi bharaa mudda he
 In that went to these people are suddenly worried about their tax to get the job done at all studies Technical Type fees to institutions like Hnge schools and donations would spend on studies of JNU
 inhen kaanvadiyon par phool barasaate ek rajya ke dijipi se poochne kii tabiyat nahin hoti ki unke paise ke phool ve dhul main kyon mila rahe hai
 In Ayodhya, they do not ask a government who is eager to register a name in the Guinness Book of World Records by burning millions of lamps, why this money is being wasted
 lekin desh, duniya or samaaj kaa naqsha gadhate or ek taarkik manushya or naagarik banaate vishvavidhyalay inhen raas nahin aate, kyonki isse inaki kritrim shanti ke shishe chatakhte hai
 So what is this peace? It is a dead peace that is neither disturbed by oppression nor injustice
 yah apane adhikaar kii maang se kuch tuutati he to vah samaaj baukhala jaataa he jise yah shanti apni suraksha ke liye bahut zaruri lagati he
 And who are these people who like this dead peace? Here again one feels the need of quoting a lion of a ghazal of Dushyant Kumar, an exalted poet - 'I have started roasting the man / man in the presence of a new tehzeeb
 'darasal yah ek murdaakhor samaaj he jo kisi bhi utpeedan yaa ninsaafi se vichlit nahin hota balki usamen shaamil hota he or uskaa sauda karata he
 This society needs peace like cremation for itself
 jo yah shanti bhang karegaa vah mujrim mana jayega
 It is the acceptance of consensus and mobilization, not of democracy, of disagreement and opposition because it appeals to a totalitarian government, its capitalists agree and the powerful groups that take advantage of it
 isliye kashmir par chup rahiye, ayodhya par chup rahiye, jeenyu kii ninda kiijie

 beete saptaah jab udyog or siyasat modi sarkaar ke pehle purna bajet ke intjaar main nakhun chaba rahe the, tab desh main kai or bajet bhi pesh ho rahe the
 India is not a budget but a country of 29 budgets and the time has come to take these 29 budgets of the states very seriously
 agle ek saal main bharat ke rajya us vittiya takat se las ho chuke honge, jo desh main aarthik nitiyon kaa hi nahin balki raajnneeti kaa cheharaa bhi badal degi
 As the French writer Victor Hugo used to say, no one can stop the idea whose time has come
 rajyon ko aarthik faislon kii aazaadee or sansaadhan dene kaa samay aa gaya tha isliye ise roka nahin ja sakaa
 You can call it the most far-reaching economic reform of India, which has quietly come amidst the political outcry of the last decade
 narendra modi ke satta main aane se pehle vitt ayog ne rajyon ke vittiya adhikaar badhaane kaa safar shuru kar diya tha, modi ne yojana ayog ko khatm karte hue ise manzil tak pahunchaa diya
 a new blueprint of federalism is emerging in India with the first full budget of the Modi government, in which the power-rich center will now be weak, while the states will become a new force in financial matters and the development needs are now not only from Delhi but also Jaipur, Bhopal, Lucknow, Chennai will also be from Bangalore, Kolkata, who have to develop this new financial strength and capabilities to handle independence
 jetali kaa bhaashan sunne ke baad bhi aap in baton se hai anjaan?yojana ayog ko khatm karte hue narendra modi vikendrikrut aarthik niti niyojan kaa nayaa khaakaa bhale hi spasht na kar paae hon lekin unhone aarthik sansadhano ke bantwaare main centre ke dabadabe ko jarur khatm kar diya
 The fourteenth Finance Commission has done the remaining work
 bajet se pehle isaki jo report sarkaar ne sweekaar kii he vah centre va rajyon ke vittiya rishton kaa nakshaa badalane ja rahi he
 States will now get 42 per cent share in central taxes i
e
 10 per cent more than the previous formula
 centre sarkaar unhen sharton main lapete bina fund degi or yahi nahin, centre rajya ke sansadhano ke hisse baantne kaa nayaa formula bhi lagu hoga jo aadhunik jaruraton ko dekhakar bana he
 Share of central taxes is around 1 after 2016

 Will increase
 koyala khadaanon ke aavanton se rajyon ko ek lakh karod ru
 Are getting yojana ayog se milane vaale anudaan va fund bhi badhenge or jiesti bhi rajyon kii kamai main ijapha karegaa
 It is not just about the supply of financial resources
 yojana ayog kii vidaai or vitt ayog kii siforeeshon kii roshni main rajyon ko in sansadhano ko kharch karne kii paryaapt aazaadee bhi mil rahi he, jo ek badi chunauti bhi he
 The financial management of most states is uneven and prehistoric
 bajaton kii prakriya kaamchalaoo he
 There are no modern capabilities in debt, cash and financial transaction management
 tex mashinari jang kha rahi he
 States probably need all the methods of planning, policy making and monitoring that became redundant for the central government after liberal market
 rajyon ko ab paardarshee va aadhunik vittiya dhaancha bananaa hoga, jo sansadhano kii is aapurti ko sambhaal sake
 The recommendation of the Finance Commission, given the first full budget and investment environment of the Modi government, is the picture that is being made, in which the major expenditure of development will be through the states, ie the center's role will be limited from big economic constructions to social structure
 
 rajyon kaa prashasanik dhaancha aakshamataaon kaa purana rogi he
 The construction activities are attributed to Contractor Raj
 yadi rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ne sujh-boojh or aadhunik tareekon kaa istemaal nahin kiya to rajyon main bhrashtachar or sarkari sansadhano kii lut kii viraat kathaayen banate der nahin lagegi, kyonki rajyon ko vittiya hi nahin balki jameen adhigrahan se lekar retail main videshi nivesh tak kai mahatvapurn pahaluon par kanoonee takat bhi mil rahi he
 Despite the political ups and downs, a new structure of governance is emerging in India
 isamen ek taraf rajya sarkarein hongi jo vikaas kii raajnneeti main centre kii bhoomika simit karengi to duusari taraf honge swatantra niamak yani regulator, jo doorsanchaar, bijli, beemaa, pension, petroleum, bandargah, airport, cammdity, pharmaceutical va paryaavaran kshetron main kendriya mantralayon ke adhikaar le chuke hai
 Railway and road regulators are in the queue
 sebi, pratispardhaa ayog, rajya bijli niamak aayogon ko shaamil karne ke baad yah nayaa shaasha varg rajnatik prabhuon se zyada taqatvar dikhataa he
 If the recommendations of regulators for water and road transport in the states also come into effect, then in the next few years, the country's economic fortunes will be written not by a cabinet equipped with leaders, but by expert regulators
 itihaas har vyakti ke liye apni tarah se jagah nirdhaarit karata he
 How will history evaluate Narendra Modi? It is still early to decide, but he has consciously or unknowingly made a great chapter in history
 unki aguai main centre or rajya ke rishton kaa dhaancha badal gaya he
 Narendra Modi will probably be the last Prime Minister to head a powerful central government in India
 unke rahete hi satta kii takat nae sultaanon yani swatantra niamakon ke paas pahunch jaaegi or vikaas ke kharch kii takat rajyon ke haath main simat jaaegi
 This is in no way inferior to the '91 or '95 reforms

 In the near future, the Reserve Bank has raised its hands to control inflation
 rigerv bank ne kaha he ki vah aavashyak vastuon kii aapurti main kami ke kaaran badi mahangaai par niyantran ke maamle main zyada kuch nahin kar saktaa
 Reserve Bank Governor d Subbarao said this at a meeting of governors of central banks in Basel
 unhone kaha, 'jaisaa ki sabhi ko pataa he aapurti dabaav se utpann mudrasphiti par niyantran ke maamle main maudrik niti nishprabhavi hathiyaar he
 He said that inflation in India is usually aggravated by the weakening of the supply side which is usually out of the grip of monetary policy
 in paristhitiyon main nikat bhavishya main rigerv bank se mudrasphiti lakshyon ko hasil karne kii ummid rakhana uchit nahin hoga
 It is noteworthy that since March 2010, the Reserve Bank of India has hiked short-term policy interest rates nine times since March 2010 to curb inflation
 mudrasphiti ab bhi aath pratishat se upar bani hui he
 The main rate of inflation 8 in March

 ab sabakuch rajyapal kesari nath treepathi ke haathon main hi he
 Kesari Nath Tripathi is a keen politician
 uttar pradesh bijepi ke adhyaksh rah chuke hai or jab uttar pradesh vidhansabha main mike feke gaye the, hangaamaa hua tha, tab vidhansabha adhyaksh kii kursi par treepathi hi the
 The bjp's strategy is clear, either to form and run Manjhi's government, which seems unlikely
 magar bijepi yah jarur chaahegi ki maanjhi ko sadan main bahumat siddh karne kaa mauka mili, jisase yah sabit hoga ki maanjhi ke saath kitne vidhayak hai
 If the MLA goes with Manjhi, the BJP will want to form a new party, in which rjd's Pappu Yadav may also go
 bijepi maanjhi kii party ko fund karegi or mahadalit netaa ke rup main sthapit karne kii koshish karegi or nitish kumaar ke mahadalit vot main send lagane kii koshish karegi
 The bjp's problem is that they do not have a strong candidate in all the seats in Bihar
 vajah yah he ki pichley chunaav tak bijepi or jediu saath-saath ladati thi
 In the 2010 assembly elections, BJP contested 102 seats and JDU on 141 seats, BJP wants to play on these 141 seats
 vah to chaahegi ki jediu ke zyada se zyada log laae jaae or bijepi ke tikat par chunaav laden
 The crisis in Bihar will be prolonged so that Nitish Kumar is proved to be greedy for power, as the image of renunciation was associated with Nitish Kumar after his removal from the Chief Minister's post, which overshadowed any strategy of BJP
 bijepi yah bhi chaah sakati he ki vahaan raashtrapati shashan lagaaya jaae or paroksh rup se shashan kiya jaae
 BJP will never want Nitish to be the chief minister till November and once again fix things
 haalanki nitish kumaar ke paksh main yah jarur hua he ki lalu yadav khul kar unke saath aa gaye hai
 It took time for Lalu to accept Nitish as Chief Minister, if the same thing happens in the party workers, then Nitish Kumar's path will become easier
 yah bhi jarur he ki agar bijepi ne maanjhi kii sarkaar banavaai to use uskaa saath nibhaana padegaa
 It will also be fatal for the BJP to leave Manjhi during the election
 isliye bihar kaa khel itaminaan se ranneeti ke tahat bijepi khelegi, kyonki dilli chunaav se free hone ke baad bijepi kaa sara dhyaan bihar par hi hoga or amit shah nitish ko jarur sabak sikhaanaa chaahegein, kyonki nitish hameshaa se modi par hamalaa karne se nahin hatate

 com sabase pehle ham yah dekhne kii koshish karte hai ki narendra modi kya nahin hai
 Whatever his adversaries say, the Prime Minister never takes an unwise or hasty decision, nor does he have the habit of playing bets and taking risks in the hobby of trying luck or luck
 ab aaie dekhte hai ki modi kya hai
 According to the people who know them well and work with them, they believe in carrying out every task
 ve kaam lene main bhi kaaphi sakht hai
 His opponents call him a dictator but ministers and bureaucrats who have worked with him disagree
 unke mutabik, pradhanmantri sabaki baat sunate hai, praasangik sawaal poochhate hai or hameshaa sujhaavon par vichaar karne ko taiyaar rahete hai
 They have an amazing ability to weigh every profit and loss before reaching a decision
 haalanki modi jab kisi masale par sahamat ho jate hai to adig nirnay, saahas or dridhtaa ke saath us par amal ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai
 They have an amazing ability to detect the pulse of time
 ve kisi kaary ko adhuraa nahin chhodte, na hi purnaviram lagaate hai
 They believe in the principle of presenting the word through action
 india today-karvi incits kaa taaja desh kaa mizaaj janamat surveykshan pradhanmantri kii shakhsiyat ke is pahalu kii pushti karata he
 The NDA graph in the country's mood survey in August 2016 showed a slight rise, while its first two rounds of surveys showed a steady decline in seat estimates, but the results of the January 2017 survey brought really good news for the Prime Minister
 yah notebandi ke baad yah pehla bada janamat surveykshan he or logon ne modi ke faisle par saaf-saaf muhar laga diya he
 According to this survey, if elections are held today, the NDA is projected to get 360 seats, 56 more than the results of the previous survey conducted in August
 sabase dilachasp baat he ki bijepi 543 main se akele 305 siten jeet sakati he jisase yah loksabhaa main bahumat main rahegi or isse sahyogi dalon (dekhen graph) par uski nirbharta kam ho jaaegi
 Modi's popularity is also showing a significant increase: 65 percent of the people consider him the best for the post of Prime Minister
 yah aankada bhi pichley agast ke mukaable 15 pratishat ankon kii badhat dikhaa rahaa he
 He has left his nearest rival Rahul Gandhi far behind with only 10 percent votes
 modi ke pradarshan kaa moolyankan karte hue ''acha" se ''behtareen" maanane waalon kaa pratishat bhi chah maheene pehle ke daur main darj 53 pratishat kii tulana main bad kar 69 par ja pahunchaa he
 Alam is that since assuming the office of Prime Minister for the first time in 2014, Modi has garnered more votes as the best Prime Minister than two of the country's most popular former Prime Ministers — Indira Gandhi and Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 iske pehle pichley agast ke surveykshan main modi kii lokapriyata main phir oochaal dikhne laga tha to uski vajah unka vah santulit dhoti-kurta bajet tha jo kaarobaar hitaishi hone kesath garibon or kisaanon ke haq main bhi tha
 This was the result of very balanced thinking
 unhone apni team main pherbadal karke spasht sanket diya ki unka uddeshy sarthak or sakaaratmak kaary karnaa he
 He successfully passed the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill in both the Houses of Parliament and showed the unique ability to take the opposition along
 agast ke surveykshan ke baad se modi ne do pramukh kadam uthaae hai
 One, on the foreign policy front, when in the last week of September, he stepped in and ordered a surgical strike in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to warn Pakistan against inciting terror attacks
 or duusare, unhone november main kathith taur par kaale dhan or nakli noton par ankush lagane keliye notebandi kaa elaan kiya, jisase puraa bharat or vishwa hill gaya
 The opposition severely criticized demonetisation as a disaster for the economy
 lekin modi apane sankalp par drudh bane rahe or kaha ki bharat ke sava sau karod deshvasi unhen puraa samarthan de rahe hai
 Modi's faith in his countrymen is proved correct by the results of the latest country's mood survey
 kareeb 45 pratishat kaa maananaa he ki notebandi se kaale dhan par ankush lagane main madad milegi, jabaki 35 pratishat ko lagata he ki isse arthvyavastha behatar hogi
 In this way, 80 percent of the public has supported his move
 yah sthiti tab ubhar kar ai he jab 55 pratishat kaa maananaa tha ki sarkaar ise behatar tareeke se lagu kar sakati thi or 51 pratishat maanate hai ki isse jitna phayda nahin hua, usase zyada nuksaan ho gaya
 What are the reasons behind the contradictory support regarding Modi's drastic move? If you look carefully, Modi's decision to discontinue big notes was not taken in any whims
 modi kaale dhan par ankush lagane or videshon main bank khaaton main jamaa kaala dhan waapas laane ke naare ke saath 2014 main satta main aae the
 When he took office, his government swiftly introduced a voluntary income declaration scheme to deal with black money stashed in foreign banks
 unhone logon ko chetaya tha ki agar iskaa paalan nahin kiya gaya to gambhir parinaam bhugatne honge or ve baad main afsos karenge
 Meanwhile, Modi launched a strong campaign to increase the number of Jan Dhan accounts for the benefit of the vast masses devoid of bank accounts of the country
 is tarah ve bhavi samay ke liye bade paimaane par digital nakad bhugtan kii bhoomika taiyaar kar rahe the
 Then came the day in November when he suddenly exposed the genie of demonetisation, which aimed to eradicate black money, fake banknotes and terrorism-funded funds
 haalanki, notebandi sirf ek aarthik niti nahin thi
 It was a powerful political weapon that Modi introduced, through which he introduced a scale of social structure that had not been seen since the Mandal movement in the 1980s
 modi vikaas ke ghode par savaar hokar satta main aae the, par unhen pataa tha ki iske jariye janata ko phir se lamaband karne kii sambhaavna simit he
 The defeat in Delhi, and especially the defeat of Bihar, indicated that their magic was waning
 yahaan tak ki mandir or gau-raksha jaise hinduvadi agenda bhi chamak kho rahe the
 Prime Minister Modi and his advisors decided to focus on such issues which should be in national interest and also gain wide support
 aise mudde jo jati, dharm or bhashaa se upar hon
 Although their development agenda had the power to unite people together, the decision of demonetisation would become even more powerful, under which the poor and the rich would stand face to face
 vanchiton ke man main yah bhaavana jaagegi ki ab paise waalon kii khayr nahin
 The disadvantaged class would consider demonetisation good despite the immense inconvenience of withdrawing money
 modi kii team ke ganit ke anusaar yahi aisa kadam tha jo congress kii garib samarthak chhavi kaa muqabla kar paata or bijepi ko baniyaa or amir samarthak chhavi se nijaat dilaa saktaa tha
 This was the weapon through which the anti-corruption image of Arvind Kejriwal and Aam Aadmi Party could be matted
 iske alaava, digital len-dein ko badhaava dekar modi aise netaa ke taur par ubhar sakate the jo ''mek in india" jaise rashtravaadi vichaaron ke bal par 21veen sadi main vishwa manch par bharat ko ek shashakt desh kii pahchaan dilaane main sakasham he
 The surgical strike on Pakistan also established Modi as a leader who aims to make India powerful
 unke virodhiyon ne notebandi ko modi kii thode samay ke liye kheli gai rajnatik chaal tehraaya, jo unhone uttar pradesh vidhansabha ke chunaav parinaam ko prabhavit karne ke liye khelaa
 He also predicted that demonetisation would not only eliminate the jobs of millions of the informal sector but would also result in a loss to the economy which could not be repaid
 endie sarkaar ko is baat kaa to shrey dena hoga ki bainkon ke baahar logon ke lambii linon main kahin bhi hinsa yaa dange kii koi ghatana nahin hui
 Apart from once speaking about the problems caused by demonetisation, Modi himself remained largely calm and moderate
 unhone india today se baatcheet main kaha, ''agar aap saaf manshaa or spashtataa ke saath kaam karen to parinaam aisa hoga ki sab dekhenge
 "the nation's mood survey results confirm Modi's assessment that despite all the trouble, people wholeheartedly support the decision of demonetisation
 surveykshan main logon ne is baat ke liye bhi modi kii tarif kii ki ve jokhim uthaane se bilkul nahin darate
 Despite all these positive aspects, there is no reason for Modi to be satisfied
 surveykshan se pataa chalata he ki aam logon ke liye borajgari or bhrashtachar sarvaadhik chintaa ke vishay bane hue hai
 The promise of creating one crore jobs every year has not yet been fulfilled, but jobs have declined
 iske baad baari aati he mahangaai kii or isamen ek nayaa mudda jud gaya he—nakadi kii kami
 The situation on the unemployment front has worsened since Modi assumed power, still 36 per cent
 mahangaai par logon kii chintaa main kami to ai he, lekin yah ab bhi bada mudda he
 At the same time people want Modi to take more strict steps against corruption and corrupt leaders
 iske saath hi is baat kii koi guarantee nahin ki notebandi ke prati jan samarthan se modi apni party ko uttar pradesh vidhansabha ke chunaav jitwa sakenge
 Generally, local issues, caste equations and state leaders are important in any assembly election
 vaise, haal hi main aam bajet aane vaala he or pradhanmantri iskaa istemaal naukariyon kii kami jaise chand mahatvapurn aam chintaaon ke niraakaran main kar sakate hai
 Modi has shown that when work is full of difficulties and there are a lot of challenges, he not only achieves success due to continuous efforts to achieve the former goals but also creates new opportunities from those situations
 kehete hai ki kismat saahsee logon kaa hi saath detii he
 Till now, this saying is being completely celebrated on Modi
 surveykshan kaa tareekakarvi incits limited ne india today-karvi incits desh kaa mizaaj janamat surveykshan kiya
 It is the most comprehensive opinion poll conducted across the country and is a vote on demonetisation
 is surveykshan main 19 rajyon andhra pradesh, assam, bihar, chhattisgarh, dilli, gujarat, haryana, jharkhand, karnataka, kerala, madhya pradesh, maharashtra, odisha, punjab, rajasthan, tamilnadu, telugana, uttar pradesh or pashchim bengal ke 97 sansadeey kshetron ke 194 vidhansabha kshetron main kul 12,143 logon se baatcheet kii gai (gramin 53 pratishat or shahari ilaakon main 47 pratishat)
 In each assembly constituency, the starting points were decided separately and according to the right-hand rule of selection of houses, a specific number of people were interviewed from every starting point
 desh kaa mizaaj janamat surveykshan ke liye baatcheet kaa kaam 30 disambar, 2016 or 9 janvari, 2017 ke bich puraa kiya gaya
 Standard questions and fixed method were discussed face to face
 sawaalon kaa anuwaad kshetreey bhashaaon main bhi muhaiyaa karaayaa gaya
 The survey was conducted under the supervision of Karvy Insights Chairman Ranjit Chib and was assisted by Dixit Chanana, Vice President, Karvy Insights

 Significantly, relations between Iran and Britain have been deteriorating since time
 pichley saal hibritain ne iran se anurodh kiya tha ki vah yaman main hathiyaaron kii aapurti ko band kare or apane prabhaav kaa istemaal sangharsh ko khatm karne ke liye kare
 Saudi Arabia was spearheading air strikes against the Yemeni government and against Iran-backed Houthi rebels
 sanyukt raashtra ne paaya thaki iran huti vidrohiyon ko missile or drone kii aapurti rokane main vifal rahaa he
 In a joint statement, Britain's Foreign Minister Boris Johnson and International Development Minister Penny Mordount had urged Iran to change its stand
 bayaan main unhone kaha tha ki agar iran vastav main yaman main raajnneetik samaadhaan chahta he jaisaa usne saarvajanik taur par kaha he, to use hathiyaaron kii aapurti rokani chahie jo sangharsh ko lanbaa khinch rahi he, kshetreey tanaav ko badha rahi he or antarrashtriya shanti evam suraksha ke liye khatra paidaa kar rahi he
 It said that we want to question why Iran is sending money to a country with which it has no real historical ties or interests, rather it should use its influence to end the conflict that the Yemenis have for that's good
 isse pehleir ke mukhiya or sabase bade netaa ayatulla ali khumaini ne kaha tha ki kshetreey muddon ko lekar tehran kaa uske khaas dushman america or 'dusht' britain se sahyog karne koi iraadaa nahin he
 One such was reported in a TV report
 khumaini ne tivi par live prasaarit bhaashan main kaha tha ki 1979 kii islamic kranti se america ab bhi iran kaa dushman he
 It would be a big mistake to trust 'wicked' Britain and the great devil America
 unhone kaha tha ki ham america se kshetreey muddon par sahyog nahin karenge
 Their goals are completely opposite to ours

 On the other hand, even though there has been a lot of political furore among the political parties over the conversion of Agra, but the UP Governor Ram Naik, who is in the limelight, has opened a new debate by giving his opinion on it
 unka kahana he ki dharm parivartan bilkul bhi galat nahin hota he or ise siyaasi taur par tool bhi nahin dena chahie
 According to Ram Naik, the creator of the Constitution, Baba Saheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar, had also changed his religion and abandoned Hinduism and embraced Buddhism
 unke mutabik, is mudde par upi main jo siyaasi koharaam machaa he, vah galat he, kyonki dharm parivartan rajnatik sangharsh kaa nahin, balki vaicharik badlaav kaa maamla he

 He said that if the debt of industrialists can be forgiven, then why not the farmers
 hanuman beniwal ne kaha ki agar rajasthan kicongress sarkaarne kisaanon kaa karj maaf nahin kiya jo sarkaar ke khilaaf joardaar andolan chalaaya jayega

 com / 5fhmzi94bwakraya kii ore se pesh hue vakil api singh ne sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha kiis maamle main abhi tak media pressure he
 With this, AP Singh questioned the investigation
 is par supreme court ne kaha ki jab court kaa faisla aa chukaa he, tab ye nayaa fact kahaan se laaye? court ne kaha ki donon paksh aadhe ghante main bahes puri karen
 AP Singh said that there has been a lot of political and media pressure in this matter
 apisingh ne saath hi gurugram ke ek skool main chaatr kii hatya kaa udhaaharan diya
 He said that innocent was implicated in the case
 agar sibiai kii tafteesh nahin hoti to sach saamne nahin aata
 That is why we had demanded an investigation in this case from an agency like CBI
 doshi akshay kii ore se pesh hue vakil apisingh ne is maamle main nirbhaya ke dost ke bayaan par sawaal uthaaya
 Singh said that Nirbhaya's friend gave an interview to the media channel after taking money
 court ne is par sawaal kiya ki in baton kaa yahaan kya mahatv he
 So AP Singh said that the boy was the only eyewitness in the case
 uski gavaahi myne rakhti he
 In this case, the girl's friend interviewed the media after taking money, which affected the case
 wo is maamle main ekmaatr chashmadid gavaah tha
 Singh said that we have filed a case against Nirbhaya's friend in Patiala House Court, on which the court will hear on December 20
 supreme court ne poocha ye relevent kaise he? to singh ne kaha ki ye nayaa saboot he
 Akshay's lawyer also questioned the investigation of the case
 iske alaava tihaad jail ke purv lau afasar sunil gupta kii kitaab kaa bhi zikr kiya
 Ram Singh's suicide was questioned in the book
 singh ne TIP yani test in parade ko lekar sawaal uthaae
 Justice Banumathi said that this fact has been considered
 singh ne kaha ki nahin ye nayaa fact he
 The court said that it makes no sense if in any case, after the completion of the trial, write a book
 singh ne kaha ki kai fact hai, jin par vichaar nahin kiya gaya
 Sunil Gupta said that i was present there at the time of TIP
 supreme court ne kaha ki TIP maamle ko court ke saamne pehle bhi laayaa gaya tha
 The book came after the court's decision
 kal ko koi kuch bhi likhegaa to kya court se saboot maan legaa
 This will start a very bad trend
 court ne kaha ki ham kisi bhi lekhak ke vichaaron par nahin ja sakate
 We cannot go into all this now
 yah ek khatarnaak pravriti set karegaa, yadi log trial samaapt hone ke baad kitaaben likhnaa shuru karte hai or aisi chizon ke bare main baat karte hai
 If we start listening to all these arguments, there will be no end
 unhen mukademe ke samay khud ko aage laana chahie tha
 Now what can be the purpose of writing all this? How can we answer this? Justice Bhushan questioned the argument made by advocate AP Singh that he would only listen to the debate on the evidence of the case
 singh ne veda puraana, treta yug kaa zikr kiya or kaha ki kalyug main log keval 60 saal tak jite hai, jabaki duusare yug main kahin zyada
 Singh also cited the climate of Delhi
 singh ne kaha ki maut kii sajaa maanavadhikaron ke khilaaf he or bhartiya samskruti ke khilaaf he
 We are living in Delhi and air is like a gas chamber, why the death penalty? i am being sentenced to death because i am poor
 dilli / NCR main hawa kii gunvattta or pani kii gunvattta vishakt or jahrili he
 The life span of any average person is becoming less and less
 nirbhaya ke balaatkaari ke liye vakil api singh ne supreme court main poocha ki is tarah kii sthiti main kisi par maut kii sajaa kyon?api singh ne phir faansee kii sajaa kii vaidhata par sawaal uthaae
 He cited the views of Mahatma Gandhi and Abdull Kalam
 unhone kaha ki bhartiya samskruti jio or jeene do main yakeen karti he
 He said that Bapu had said that while taking a decision, the poorest man should be taken care of, what will he gain? No one is going to benefit from the death penalty here
 faansee kii sajaa nyaay ke naam par sabase badi ninsaphi he
 Solicitor General Tushar Mehta argued on behalf of Delhi Police
 unhone kaha ki yah maut kii sajaa ke liye feet cese he
 This is the rarest of rare case
 doshi kisi tarah kii sahanubhuti paane kaa hakdaar nahin he
 He should get the death penalty
 is maamle main jald faisla ho
 Convicted legal bets are taking time by playing punches
 mehta ne kaha ki punarvichaar yachika ko khaarij kiya janaa chahie
 AP Singh gave the example of Rajiv Gandhi and Beant Singh being sentenced to death by hanging
 singh ne nalini jaise kai maamalon kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki in maut kii sajaa ke maamalon me faansee kii sajaa ko umr kaid me badla gaya he

 India were bowled out for 235 after scoring 250 in the first innings
 IND vs AUS: chauthe din bharat ne diya 323 kaa target, australia ne banaae 104 / 4bharat ne chaay ke vishram se pehle hi aron finch (11) ko out karke australia ko shuruaati jhatka diya
 When Finch did not even open the account, on the second ball of Ishant Sharma's innings, the umpire gave him LBW out
 ballebaaj ne diares kaa sahaara liya
 Ishant had Noble and so the decision was changed
 aswin ne haalanki chaay ke vishram se thik pehle finch ko wicketiper rishabh pant ke haathon kaich karakar bharat ko pehali safalataa dilaai
 Playing his first Test match, Marcus Harris found it expensive to cut Mohammed Shami's ball without getting in line and Pant took his eighth catch of the match
 isse pehle pujaara ne haris kaa mushkil kaich bhi choda tha
 Kohli's big feat in Australia, for the first time in 50 years, Australia was now on its two experienced batsmen Usman Khawaja and Shaan Marsh
 aswin ne haalanki khwaja (aath) ko out karke bharat ko badi safalataa dilaai
 The left-handed batsman landed the ball taking flight and was caught by Rohit Sharma beautifully
 marsh ne peter handscomb (14) ke saath milakar 13 over se bhi adhik samay tak bharat ko safalataa nahin milane di
 In such a situation, Shami again took the ball and Handscomb pulled an easy catch to Pujara at midwicket after his short pitch ball was pulled from the wrong timing
 isse pehle bharat ne subah teen wicket par 151 ran se aage khelnaa shuru kiya
 Pujara and Rahane put an 87-run partnership for the fourth wicket to put the Australian attack on the backfoot
 pehali pari main shatak jadne vaale pujaara ne din ke shuru main hi do chauke lagaakar sakaaratmak andaaj main shuruyaat kii
 Rahane survived being caught out by the DRS in the 74th over
 us samay gend unke balle se nahin lagi thi
 Kohli said- i made mistakes on the first tour to Australia, but now i am changed, Humpuzara completed his 20th half-century off 140 balls
 australia ne 80 over ke turant baad nai gend lee
 However, Stark did not have complete control of his balls
 australia ko aakhir main 88wein over main din kii pehali safalataa mili jab leone ne pujaara ko short leg par kaich out karaayaa
 When Pujara was returning to the pavilion, the audience stood up and greeted him
 pujaara ne is match main 450 gendon kaa saamana kiya
 He has reached the second position after Sachin Tendulkar (525 balls, Sydney, 2004) in the list of Indian batsmen who have faced the most balls in a match on Australian soil
 Reward for Nathan Lyon and Pujara's terrific knock comes to an end

 anachaahe baalo ko dur karne ke liye ham vaix karaate hai lekin kai baar vaix karaane ke baad skin par dane ubhar aate hai
 Sometimes the problem of rashes also occurs
 kai baar to ye rashes or dane kuch hi der main thik ho jate hai lekin kai baar ye lambey samay tak bane rahete hai
 There is no pain in these grains, but it does definitely cause itching
 saath hi twachaa bhi smood najar nahin aati
 This problem is especially in the upper back and arm
 kuch logon ko to ye problem itani zyada ho jaati he ki unhen doctor se salaah leni padati he lekin agar samasya bahut gambhir nahin he to in upayon ko apanaakar aap in daanon or rashes se aaraam paa sakati hai
 If waxing is not necessary, avoid waxing during periods
 in dinon main hamaara sharir hormonal badlaav ke chalate bahut sensotive ho jaataa he
 Which increases the risk of any kind of infection
 ek baat kaa khyaal rakhen, vaix karaane ke turant badagarm maahaul main jane se bachein
 Actually, our pores open after waxing
 aise main bahut adhik garm or pradooshan vaali jagah par jane se porce main gandagi bhar jaati he
 The possibility of boils from pimples increases
 agar dane ho gaye hai to ye upaay aapke liye phydemand rahenge:1
 If you have rash after waxing, use anti-biotic cream or lotion at these places
 isse khujali nahin hogi or daag-dhabbe banane kaa khatra bhi nahin rahegaa
 2
 vexing ke baad agar dane ho gaye hai yaa rashes kii problem ho gai he to kuch dinon tak prabhavit jagah par sabun lagane se bachein
 If soap is to be used, then use some cream based and mild soap
 3
 During this time, wear loose and cotton clothes only
 bahut tite kapade pahanane serashes or daanon kii problembad jaaegi
 4
 prabhavit jagah par barf kaa istemaal karen
 This will suppress the pimples and reduce itching
 barf lagane ke baad moishcharizer lagaana na bhoolen
 5
 nariyal tel yaa tii tree oil lagaana bhi phydemand hoga
 Take special care of one thing that do not scratch the grains with nails
 varanaa ye dane pak bhi sakate hai or daag bhi ban saktaa he

 com / c8vlddxj3w — Priyanka Gandhi Vadra (@priyankagandhi) July 31, 2019: BJP has suspended accused MLA Kuldeep Sengar from the party after increasing pressure
 senger, unke bhai manoj or aath anya ke khilaaf sadak durghatana ke maamle main police ne exiaar darj kii he
 The victim was seriously injured in the accident on Sunday and her aunt and aunt died
 haadase main mrit mahilaon main se ek unnav dushkarm maamle kii gavaah thi
 The victim's mother alleged that the incident was a conspiracy to eliminate her daughter and others
 ravivaar ko The name of the book - Bhaag Milkha Bhaaglekha - Milkha Singh's Writings - Sonia Samwalkaprakash - Prabhat Prakashan Price - Rs 125 (paperback) Both 'bhaag Milkha Bhaag' and 'milkha Singh' do not need introduction
 milkha singh ko ham varshon se 'flring sikh' ke naam se jaanate hai
 In the 2013 film Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, we also know the story of their struggle
 aise main pehla pehla sawaal yah ki jab ham film main milkha singh kii kahani se rubaru ho chuke hai to phir yah aatmakatha kyon? 152 pannon main aisa kya he jo hamen ise padhane par majaboor kare or yah ki kya milkha singh ke sangharsh or safalataa kii kahani mahaj 152 pannon main puri ho jaati he?darasal, sawaal kai the or sawaalon ke jawaab ke liye kitaab ko padhanaa bhi jaruri tha
 So the process of turning the pages of the book started and in the first lines that i saw, it was written - If you want to destroy the celebrity, then there is gul-e-gulzar in Dana Khak
 yah kitaab kii shuruyaat main bhoomika se bhi pehle ankit kii gai panktiyaan hai
 But why these lines were first published in the book, the answer is found in the last and 152 pages of the book
 milkha singh ne kitaab ke 20wein adhyay 'upsanhaar' main likhaa he, 'main na to koi lekhak hum or na hi rachayita balki ek jununee khilaadi hum, jisane is kitaab main apana dil kholkar rakh diya he
 'believe me if you read the book, you also feel the same
 asal main yah kitaab milkha singh ke ehsaas, unke vichaar or unke yah vichaar kaise bane isi kii baangi he
 This is indeed his heart, because it does not have the philosophical writings of a scribed writer but a common man's success
 kitaab padhane ke kram main kabhi yah nahin lagata ki aap kisi mahaan hasti kii aatmakatha pard rahe hai
 Turning the pages is like Milkha Singh sitting in front and telling you the result of life in pure desi style
 apane dil kaa haal saamne rakh rahe hai
 What's new in the book is the basis of the film 'bhaag Milkha Bhaag' and the autobiography 'bhaag Milkha Bhaag', but the style and design are different
 masalan kitaab main aisi kai baaten yaa kahaniyaan hai jo film main nahin dikhaai gai hai or kitaab padhakar yah jaankaree milti he ki film main aise kai tathy the jo asal main sirf manoranjan ke put ke taur par istemaal kiye gaye the
 For example, the love story shown by Milkha Singh in the film is not entirely correct
 film main singh kii shaadi or jeevanasathi ke prati vichaaron kaa zikr nahin he
 Nor is there mention of those events when he meets his life partner Nimmi
 iske alaava pakistan se bharat or unka va unke parivaar khaskar bahan ko lekar jo kuch film main dikhaaya gaya he usamen ek jaldbaaji he, jabaki kitaab tathyaatmak dhang se aapako sachai or tab kii paristhitiyon se avgat karwaati he
 Dil Ki Baat Milkha Singh has divided his life into 20 chapters
 inamen kai adhyay aise hai, jisamen unhone vaaki dil kholkar rakh diya he
 It means to say that in these they have said what they felt or what they thought
 isamen khushi he, gam he, gussa he, naaraazgi he or aashaa he
 Then, whether it was the moment of meeting Nehru ji or politics in sports administration and sports
 milkha singh ne kitaab ke jariye bebaaki se apni raay rakhi he
 He has clearly written in the book that the way the game is being politicized is taking the game and the players in the wrong direction
 vah likhte hai ki kaise khel sanghathanon kii baithak main unhen pasand nahin kiya jaataa rahaa he or kaise adhyaksh jaise pad par aise log baith jate hai, jinka khel se kabhi naata hi nahin rahaa
 Why read, if you are truly inspired by Milkha Singh on the silver screen then this book is for you
 agar aapako aatmakatha padhane kaa shauk he to yah kitaab aapke liye he
 If you want to read a simple, flat but factual writing rather than a philosophical biography, then this book is for you
 agar aapaki khel main dilchaspee he to yah kitaab aapako prerit kar sakati he
 If you have less time to read and want to read a good book then these 152 pages are for you
 
 
 
 And finally i would like to finally write the last lines of the book, from which Milkha Singh has finished his autobiography
 vah likhte hai- 'ek khilaadi ke rup main jivan kathin he
 But there is definitely a time when you are attracted to skip it or try to take shortcuts
 yaad rakhen ki safalataa kaa koi shortkat nahin hota
 If you want to reach the top, end your existence, because the grain has to be dusted to germinate and then blossom into a flower

 Every worker of our party is a staunch patriot
 humlog sote jaagate har samay desh ke bare main sochate hai, desh kii tarakkee ke bare main sochate hai
 When the country lags behind other country in the world of sports at the international level, every person who wants this country hurts, they think what we lacked
 arvind kejariwal ne aage kaha ki desh ko aaazaad hue 70 saal ho gaye hai
 We have been able to bring a total of 28 medals to the Olympic Games in 70 years, it has only 9 gold

 China won 70 medals at the 2016 Olympics
 yahi nahin chote-chote desh jaise kenya ko 13 medal mili, jamaayka ko 11 medal, kazakhstan ko 18, croatia ko 10 medal mili, lekin bharat ko 2 medal mili or ab tak keval 28 medal mil hai
 Then there is a lot of trouble

 Is our country less than other countries, no
 hamaara desh duniya kaa sabase behtareen desh he
 Are the people of our country less than any country in the world, are the players or youth of our country less, not at all

 ham is bill ko is sapane ke saath laa rahe hai ki bharat olympic 2024 main ham 3 medal laaegaa
 Will bring 10 medals in 2028, eventually more than China
 is sapane ke saath bill ko sadan main laayaa gaya he
 Further, CM Kejriwal said that China first participated in the 1952 Olympics, then in 1984
 china ne gold laane ke liye 32 saal samay liya or gold jeeta
 We will fulfill this dream in less than 32 years
 iske liye uniwarsity ko netaaon ko nahin chalaanaa hoga
 If leaders and officers run this university, then our dream will not be fulfilled
 ise profeshnal ko chalaanaa chahie
 It should be very fast decision
 khilaadiyon ko kisi tarah kii taklif nahin honi chahie
 More medals will come from China! Kejriwal claimed that it is being made with the tax money of the people of Delhi, Delhi will get preference but players from all over the country will come here and take training
 yah puure desh kekhiladiyon kaa sapana puraa karegi
 This will be the milestone to fulfill the dream of the people of this country

 Chinese media say that in 2012 there was tension between China and Japan over Diaoyu Iceland, Japan tried to nationalize the island, even though China has been calling it its sovereign territory
 donon deshon ke bich yah tanaav vyapaar main bhi dekhne ko mila or china-japan-dakshin korea free trade agreement sthagit ho gaya
 In 2015, China and South Korea signed a separate bilateral free trade agreement
 mana ja rahaa tha ki agar japan-china-dakshin korea ke bich free trade agreement ho jaataa, to teenon deshon kii arthvyavastha ko kaaphi phayda miltaa
 China says the RCEP should avoid such a situation
 yani spasht he ki china nahin chahta ki bharat ke saath vyapaar main seemaa vivaad koi baadha bane
 The Global Times has written that China will not compromise on the sovereignty over its sovereign territory, but is fully committed to resolving the border dispute through negotiations with its neighbors
 kisi bhi vivaad ko badhaava dena donon deshon ke liye ghaatak hoga

 Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj said on this that a constitutional crisis has arisen in the country and it is not known who is the Railway Minister
 isliye sarkaar trivedi par sthiti spasht kare
 Sharad Yadav said in Parliament that it is not known how the government is going
 vahiin left ne bhi sarkaar se sthiti spasht karne kii maang kii
 The CPI said, the public feels the government is weak
 trinmul congress ke saansad sudeep bandopadhyaay ne kaha ki trivedi kaa maamla mamata or unki party kaa maamla he or party ne trivedi ko kabhi istipha dene ko nahin kaha he
 Later Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said that Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi has not resigned but a message has been received from the Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee to the Prime Minister which is under active consideration
 vipaksh dwaara rail mantri ko lekar sthiti spasht kiye jane kii maang par sadan ke netaa ne kaha, ‘vipaksh ke sadasyon ne rail mantri ke bare main kuch baaten uthaayi hai, mujhe yah kahana he ki rail mantri ne istipha nahin diya he

 ’vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki desh sanvaidhanik sankat ke daur se guzar rahaa he
 a few hours after presenting the Railway Budget comes the news of the resignation of the Railway Minister
 ek anya mantri (harish ravat) istipha dekar kopbhavan main baithe hai
 Government should tell whether Dinesh Trivedi is Railway Minister or not
 buudhvaar ko pesh rail bajet jinda he yaa nahin?pranab ne kaha ki rail mantri ne istipha nahin diya he
 The approval of the Prime Minister is not required for the railway budget, it does not require the approval of the Cabinet
 ise vitt mantri kii manjuuri praapt hoti he
 'as Finance Minister, i take responsibility for the Railway Budget
 ab yah sansad kii sampatti he or sadan ko is par vichaar karnaa he
 'sushma had asked the government to clarify who is responsible for the railway budget
 trinmul congress ke sansadeey party ke netaa sudeep bandopadhyaay ne kaha, ‘trinmul congress ne kabhi bhi dinesh trivedi ko istipha dene ke liye nahin kaha

 ’ jad you adhyaksh sharad yadav ne kaha ki loktantr main paardarshita or khulaapan jaruri hota he
 How to advance the culture of shared government should be decided

 Vasudev Acharya of the CPI (M) said the situation was grave when the Railway Minister was asked to resign after presenting the Railway Budget
 sarkaar main shaamil mantri apni party ke mantri ke istife kii maang ko lekar sansad parisar main dharna par baithte hai
 The Prime Minister should clarify the situation on this subject
 bhakpa ke gurudas dasgupta ne kaha, ‘ham bhi trinmul congress ke rail yatri kiraaye main vruddhi ko waapas lene kii maang kaa samarthan karte hai
 The increase in rail passenger fares should be withdrawn

 desh main petrol or dijal kii keemten shatak lagane kii taraf bad rahi hai
 The public is very angry about it and the opposition parties are attacking the government
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki sarkaar aakhir kuch kar kyon nahin rahi he? kya sarkaar kuch kar sakati he? kya uske paas koi vikalp he?asal main, petrol-dijal kii keemton par ankush ke liye sarkaar ke paas philhal teen vikalp hai, lekin teenon bahut mushkil hai
 The government and the Bharatiya Janata Party are aware that they may suffer due to rising prices of petrol and diesel
 petrol or dijal kii keemten apane ab tak ke ucchtam str par hai
 Petrol 76 in Delhi on Tuesday
 87rupee prati litre or dijal 68
 08 was Rs per liter
 aaie jaanate hai ki sarkaar ke saamne kya hai vikalp
 
 
 If one rupee is reduced tax, then the loss of 13,000 crores is the first option to reduce the excise duty and VAT levied by the Central and State Governments
 april tak ke aankadon ko dekhen to upabhokta petrol kii jo keemat detaa he uskaa 47 fisadi tex or dijal kii keemat kaa 38 fisadi tex hota he
 But the problem is that if the government reduces even one rupee in tax, then there is a loss of Rs 13,000 crore annually in its coffers
 isliye na to centre sarkaar or na hi rajya sarkarein iske liye himmat kar paa rahi hai
 So the price of petrol in Delhi will be 45
 75 rupee prati litre!doosraa vikalp yah he ki eendhan ko jiesti main laayaa jaae
 This lollipop has been shown for quite some time, but it is not possible so far
 yah centre or rajya sarkaron, donon ke liye kaaphi kadavi dawaai he
 If the GST of 18% is also fixed on petrol, then the price of petrol in Delhi will be reduced to 45
 75 rupee prati litre aa jaaegi
 But for this, the central and state governments will have to show a big heart
 isaki vajah he tel par tex se hone vaali baari kamai
 Bringing millions of crores of fuel from tax on petroleum under GST will result in a loss of about 2 lakh crores in tax revenue to the government
 gautalab he ki eendhan par tex se saal 2016-17 main centre or rajya sarkaron ko 4
 The revenue was Rs 63 lakh crore
 opek deshon se karen mol-tolatisraa vikalp duniya ke bhu-raajnneetik paridrishy par nirbhar karata he
 India, Japan and China are among the Asian countries that pay higher prices for purchasing crude oil from OPEC countries
 ise 'asian premium' kehete hai or yah prati bairal 3 se 8 dollar tak zyada ho saktaa he
 This practice has been going on since 1987
 asian desh yah dhamkee to dete rahe hai ki ve lamabandi kar crude kharid karenge, lekin ab tak aisa ho nahin paaya he
 Therefore, if India is able to join such a mobilization and OPEC agrees to withdraw the Asian premium, then the Indian government can rely on it to cut its tax
 antarrashtriya bazaar main crude yanikache tel kii keemat80 bairal prati dollar pahunch gai he
 Joe Crude Basket 52 of India till April
 49 dollar prati bairal tha vah ab badhkar 72 dollar ko paar kar gaya he, yani bharat ko is keemat par kaccha tel mil rahaa he
 If the price of crude crosses $ 100, then in this whole year, India will get crude oil at an average of $ 93 per barrel
 yah saal 2016-17 ke str se thik doguna hoga
 For now, it does not seem that the government is thinking of any tax reduction
 is bare main ek sawaal par haal main petroleum mantri dharmendra pradhan ne kaha, 'yah sambhav nahin he
 How will roads be built in villages? If the state governments do not impose any tax on petroleum products, then how will there be development in the villages? At the moment, the easiest route may be for governments to gradually reduce excise and VAT

 ) Addressing an election rally in Kalaburgi on 29 April, BS Yeddyurappa announced that he would take oath as the Chief Minister of Karnataka on 17 May
 yediurppa ke guuruuvaar ko mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lene ke baad unka yah daawa sach bhi sabit ho gaya
 After taking oath, Yeddyurappa said he was 100 percent confident of proving majority
 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav main 104 siton par jeet darj kar bijepi sabase badi party ke taur par ubhari he lekin iske baavjood bijepi bahumat se 8 vidhayak dur he
 At the same time, after the results of the Congress and JDS, the alliance has reached the figure of 116
 rajyapal vajubhai vaala ne yediurppa ko vidhansabha main bahumat sabit karne ke liye 15 din kaa samay diya he
 Now starts from here, the real test of CM Yeddyurappa, the BJP has given the same argument outside the Supreme Court and that it will prove a majority in the House
 is daawey kaa yahi matlab nikalataa he ki bijepi congress yaa jedies yaa donon partiyon ke navnirvaachit sadasyon se dal-badal kii ummid kar rahi he
 However, this type of party-change is not new in the history of Indian politics
 1980 ke daur main dal-badal kaa chalan itnaa zyada bad gaya ki sansad ko '52wein samvidhan sanshodhan act' ke jariye samvidhan main 10veen anusuchee daalani padi
 This 10th schedule is known as the Anti Defection Law (anti-defection law)
 1985 main kanoon banane ke baad bhi jab dal-badal par puri tarah nakel nahin kas pai to isamen sanshodhan kiye gaye
 In 2003, it was decided that not just one person, if the party is changed collectively, it will also be declared unconstitutional
 iske alaava, isi sanshodhan main dhara 3 ko bhi khatm kar diya gaya, jiske tahat ek tihaai party sadasyon ko lekar dal badla ja saktaa tha
 Now to do something like this, the consent of two-thirds of the members is necessary
 resort se gaayab hue congress ke do or vidhaayakakya kahata he anti defections lau (dal-badal nishedh kanoon)?anusuchee ke duusare paragraph main anti defections lau ke tahat ayogy qaraar die jane kaa aadhaar spasht kiya gaya he-yadi koi vidhayak swechha se party kii sadsyta tyaag dungar vah party dwaara jari kiye gaye nirdesh ke khilaaf jaakar vot kare yaa phir voting se dur rahe
 Independent candidates will be disqualified if they join a political party
 One party may merge with another party, but for this at least two-thirds of the party's mlas vote is necessary
 shapath lete hi yediurppa ne kiya kisaanon kii karjamaafee kaa ailaakhtit main supreme court ne samvidhan main 'swechha se party kii sadsyta chhodane' ko bhi spasht kiya he
 The court has also given an explanation for voting against the party's directive or abstaining from voting
 'ravi nayak banaam bharat sangh' ke maamle main supreme court ne nirnay diya tha ki swechhapurvak sadsyta chhodana istipha nahin he, balki isaki vyakhya kahin zyada vistrut he
 a member can voluntarily relinquish his membership from a political party even if he has not resigned from the membership of the party
 ek duusare faisle main supreme court ne kaha tha ki agar kisi party kaa koi vidhayak apni raajnneetik party se baahar kisi or netaa ko sarkaar banane ke liye samarthan kaa patr rajyapal ko saunp detaa he to yah maan liya jayega ki us sadsy ne party kii apni sadsyta swechhapurvak tyaag di he
 In this way, if any Congress or JDS MLA votes in favor of the Yeddyurappa government in the floor test or gives a letter of support, it will be considered a party-change
 haalanki aisi sthiti main karnataka vidhansabha kaa spikar yah faisla karegaa ki sadsy anti defections lau ke tahat doshi he yaa nahin
 There is also another way to form a stable government of BJP in Karnataka
 kya oparation lotus phir se paar lagayegaa naiya?karnataka main 'oparation lotus' achaanak se charchaa kaa vishay ban gaya he
 The BJP was caught in a similar situation in 2008, when the bjp's strategic move was named Operation Lotus
 us chunaav main bhi bijepi bahumat ke aankade se dur thi
 The JDS and 6 Congress mlas resigned from their membership before a majority test in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly
 baad main hue upachunaav main un vidhayakon ne bijepi ke tikat par chunaav ladaa
 The Congress and the JDS had alleged that the BJP had sold their mlas
 report ke mutabik, siddharmaiya ke shasankaal main kathith taur par lingayaton ke tushtikaran or vokkaliga samudaay kii andekhi kii vajah se jedies dal-badal kii ashanka se pareshaan he
 The bjp's hope rests on the anti-congress legislators of the JDS
 duusari taraf, congress ke kuch lingayat samarthak vidhayak khaskar bombai karnataka kshetra ke vidhayak bhi 'oparation lotus' ke tahat bijepi kii 'madad' karne ke liye taiyaar bataae ja rahe hai

 haryana ke mevaat kii nuh tehsil main rahane vaale pahalu khan ko ek dardanaak maut mili, jiske bare main usne kabhi sochaa bhi nahin hoga
 Aspect Khan ran a dairy
 unke kaam main doodh kii zyada khapat thi
 So, he went to Jaipur district of Rajasthan in April 2017 to buy a buffalo
 lekin zyada doodh ke laalach main pahalu khan ne ek gaay kaa sauda kar liya
 That same cow proved fatal for him
 1 april 2017yahi wo taarikh thi, jis pahalu khan apane aakhri safar par nikle the
 Aspect Khan, who lives in Noah town of Mewat, had reached Jaipur to buy buffalo
 vahaan adhik doodh ke laalach main unhone ek gaay kharid lee
 Just this decision became the cause of death for him
 jab vah gaay lekar laut rahe the, to alvar jile kii bahrod puliya ke paas kuch ativaadee sanghathanon ke logon ne unhen gher liya
 And considering them as smugglers, they attacked him
 sadak par khinch kar pahalu khan kii buree tarah se maar pitayee kii gai
 Two of his sons and two other people, including Pehram Khan, were seriously injured in the attack
 jab aaropee darinde us begunaah bujurg ke saath darindagi kar rahe the, to kuch log vahaan khadey hokar ghatana kaa video bana rahe the
 During this time people continued to watch the spectacle and beat up the accused aspect, Khan
 unhen sadak par khinchaa gaya, peeta gaya
 He kept shouting for help but no one came forward to help him
 halaat ko dekhte hue maukey par pahunchi police force ne bheed ko maukey se hataane ke liye lathicharge kiya

 aise main in logon ko giraftaar karne se puraa cese kamjor ho jaataa, kyonki ye log maukey par maujuud nahin the
 After the incident, some people from civil society held a press conference in Delhi in this regard and raised serious questions over the investigation of the Pehlu Khan case
 fact finding cameti ne police jaanch main tamaam khamiyaan ginate hue cese ko court main chalange karne kii baat kahi thi
 During this time, famous lawyers Prashant Bhushan and Indira Jaising, including independent journalist Ajit Sahi, were present at the press conference
 jahaan unhone fact finding cameti kii report ko saarvajanik kiya
 On the basis of the report, the investigation claimed these 10 major flaws: 1
 exiaar ke mutabik police ko pahalu khan kii ghatana ke bare main 2 april ko subah 4
 Revealed at 24 hrs
 jabaki ye ghatana 1 april ko shaam 7 baje hui
 The distance from the spot to the police station is just 2 kilometers
 exiaar ke mutabik police ko kareeb 9 ghante baad ghatana kii soochna mili
 2
 vahiin duusari taraf, usee exiaar main likhaa he ki pahalu khan kaa bayaan raat 11 bajkar 50 minute par record kar liya tha
 In such a situation, when the police got the information about the incident only after four o'clock in the morning, then how did the police record the statement of Peerkhar Khan 4 hours before
 3
 Half an hour after the attack, police took Aspect Khan and his son to the hospital
 jabaki exiaar main kisi chashmadid pulicekarmi kaa naam nahin he
 He was not even made a witness in the case
 4
 In the Ding Declaration, 6 people were nominated by Peer Khan
 pahalu khan ke bayaan ke mutabik un par hamalaa karne vaale kah rahe the ki vah bajrang dal or vishwa hindu parishad ke sadsy hai
 In such a situation, the question is that when Pehrak Khan was not from that area, how could he remember the names of these 6 people
 aakhir kisne use ye naam die?5
 It has been said in the police report that Pahul Khan's daring declaration was investigated and it was found that all the 6 accused were present in a cowshed at the time of the incident
 6
 All these 6 accused told the police during the investigation that they did not have mobile phones on the crime scene and the police accepted their statement as evidence
 7
 These accused were absconding for 5 months and suddenly came to record their statements to the police and said that they were not present at the scene
 police ne unke ye bayaan saboot maan liye
 8
 bahrod ke teen sarkari doctoron ne bataaya ki pahalu khan kii maut chot kii vajah se hui thi, jo unhen hamale ke dauraan lagi thim
 9
 jabaki police ne sarkari doctoron kii report ko andekha kiya or ek privet aspataal (jo ki bijepi netaa or kendriya mantri kaa he) ke doctoron kii baat maani
 10
 bijepi netaa ke aspataal ke doctoron ne police ko bataaya ki jab pahalu khan aspataal pahunchaa, tab uski haalat thik thi
 His nose was bleeding and he complained of chest pain
 is aadhaar par doctoron ne pahalu khan kii maut kii vajah heart atake bataaya
 Civil society accused them of diverting the investigation into the case, stating all the flaws in the police investigation and its theory
