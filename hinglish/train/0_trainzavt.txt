 Off-spinner Graeme Swann of the England cricket team has announced his retirement from international and first-class cricket with immediate effect
 34 saal ke swaan ne 60 maichon main 255 wicket liye hai
 Swann, who made his Test debut at the age of 29, announced his retirement in the middle of the Ashes
 ab vah ashes ke baaki bache do test maichon main nahin khelenge
 In this way Swan's career 29
 96 ke ausat se wicket chatakaate hue samaapt hua
 England have played 66 Tests since Swan's debut in 2008 and Swan has competed in 60 of them
 swaan ne nishchit taur par maujuuda ashes shrunkhlaa main naakaami ke kaaran sanyas liya he
 He has been among the senior players such as captain Alastair Cook and Kevin Pietersen who could not make their expected contribution in the series
 ashes ke shuruaati teen maichon main 80 ke ausat se saat wicket lene vaale swaan ne kaha ki vah vaise bhi jald hi sanyas lene vaale the, kyonki unka sharir paanch-divasiy maichon kii jarurat ko puraa nahin kar rahaa tha
 Swan, i was about to retire soon
 bas apane desh ke liye lagaataar chauthi baar ashes jeetne kii tamanna mere man main thi
 This desire brought me to Australia
 vaise ab meraa sharir test maichon kii chunauti ko bardaasht nahin kar paa rahaa he
 Before coming here, i was thinking that this is my last Australia tour
 swaan ke sanyas kaa yah matlab he ki ab monti panesar baaki bache do test maichon main visheshgy spin gendbaaj kii bhoomika adaa karenge
 But the biggest question is who is the spin bowler that fits into England's long-term plan
 swaan ne kuch samay pehle kaha tha ki daraham ke leg spin gendbaaj scot borthvik main lambey samay tak english cricket kii seva karne kii kshamta he or saath hi saath vah ek achche ballebaaj bhi hai
 This would give the team an all-rounder
 england ke sabase safal spin gendbaaj derek underwood rahe hai
 Underwood has taken 297 wickets, but the Swans are 42 wickets behind
 vaise swaan england ke sabase safal gendbaajon kii suchi main chathe kram par hai

 unhone bhaavnaatmak aadhaar par bhi doshiyon ke liye kam sajaa kii maang kii

 At the same time, it has been argued in favor of Mukesh that even though he is driving the bus, it does not mean that he has done the crime
 kal bhi lagaaya tha aropmangalvaar ko jab saket adaalat ne chaaron aropiyon ko doshi qaraar diya tha, tab bhi api singh ne ise raajnneetik dabaav main satta paksh kii ore se thopa gaya faisla bataaya tha
 He had alleged that Pawan Gupta, Vinay Sharma, Mukesh Kumar and Akshay Thakur did not have money and manpower
 isliye unhen sajeesh ke tahat fansaaya gaya

 unhone kaha ki congress party ne sabhi ke kalyaan kii yojana ke bare main apane ghoshnaa patr main elaan kiya he
 Meanwhile, Sonia Gandhi attacked the TRS government of the state fiercely
 unhone jansabha main maujuud logon se poocha ki kya telugana ke janm ke samay jo sapane aapane dekhe the, unamem se pichley chaar saalon main kitne puure hue? unhone logon se congress party or gathbandhan main shaamil apane sahyogi dalon ko vot dekar jitaane kii apil kii
 It was a pleasure coming to Telangana to meet my son: Sonia Gandhi Sonia Gandhi said, "today i have come to Telangana, i am very happy
 meri khushi waisi hi he jaisi ek maa kii apane bete se milane par hoti he
 Every mother wants her children to flourish and grow, but today i am very sad to see the state of Telangana
 aapako is baat kaa ehsaas he ki jitna telugana kaa vikaas hona chahie tha, utana nahin hua he
 Sonia said - Saddened by the lack of development of Telangana, Hansonia asked the people present at the rally that how many dreams you had dreamed during the birth of Telangana were fulfilled in the last four years? He said that the new state was formed because farmers would get water and people would get employment, but this did not happen
 yahaan ke kisaan aatmahatya karne ko majaboor hai
 Far from doing anything for the farmers, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government here deliberately ignored the land acquisition law of the UPA government
 telugana ke noujvaan niraash, rojgaar ke liye bhatak raheh soniaupie adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne kaha ki yahaan ke logon ko manaregaa kaa laabh bhi nahin mila
 The youth of Telangana are disappointed and wandering in search of employment today
 sonia gandhi ne kaha, 'pehle main jab bhi yahaan aati thi or yahaan kii mahilaon se milti thi, to unki swayan sahaayak sansthaaon ko dekhati thi
 After this, whenever i went to other states, i used to give example here
 lekin dukh kii baat yah he ki yahaan kii mahilaon ko aage badhaane kaa kargar hathiyaar hi tiares sarkaar ne khatm kar diya
 What did Rahul Gandhi say after Sonia? After Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi addressed an election rally in Medchal
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki telugana ke gathan main sonia gandhi kaa bhi yogadan he
 The people of Telangana created this state after stiff struggle
 telugana rajya banane ke masale par sonia gandhi janata ke saath hameshaa khadi raheen
 He said that since the formation of Telangana, there has been a one-man government, but Congress will not be a one-man government
 yah yahaan ke kisaanon or naujavaanon kii sarkaar hogi
 The voice of the youth, farmers and women of Telangana is echoing in this alliance

 The voice of the youth, farmers and women of Telangana is echoing in this alliance

 At the same time, the Congress has invited TDP and other partners of the Grand Alliance for the public meeting of UPA President Sonia Gandhi in Medchal
 haalanki tedepa pramukh chandrababu naidu is raily ke dauraan sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ke saath manch saajha nahin karenge
 The Congress formed an alliance with the TDP and the Telangana Jan Samiti, CPI, against the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) last month
 congress ke rajya prabharee aarasi khuntia ne bataaya ki rahul gandhi ke 28 or 29 november ko rajya ke daure ke samay naidu congress ke saath prachaar karenge
 However, Naidu will not share the stage in all the gatherings

 Chandra had sought quashing of the charges framed against him by the lower court
 nyaayamurti em el mehta kii peeth ne sibiai ko notice jari karne kaa aadesh diya
 Chandra moved the High Court against the October 22, 2011 order of the Special CBI Judge
 unhone kaha ki yah faisla ‘laaparvaahee or asaavadhaanee’ se kiya gaya he
 He had said that the verdict has been pronounced 'without judicial thought' as there is no evidence that he had conspired with any government official for wrong economic benefits
 chandra ne daleel di thi, ‘is baat kaa koi sakshya nahin he ki yachikakarta (chandra) ne khud ko galat tarah se aarthik phayda pahunchane ke liye athwa bharat sarkaar ko galat tareeke se nuksaan pahunchane ke liye kisi bhi rup main kisi sarkari adhikari ke saath sajeesh rachi
 'the petition states that there is no evidence that he or his company paid any bribe to get a Unified Access Services License (UASL) and in this respect their case is different from the rest of the accused
 chandra ne kaha, ‘prativaadee (sibiai) dwaara ise kabool karne ke baavjood nichali adaalat ne aarope tay karne ke apane aadesh main rishwat ke aaropon ke taar unitech wirelas company se galat tarah se jode

 nichali adaalat ne bhartiya dand samhita or bhrashtachar rokthaam kanoon ke vibhinn praavdhaanon ke tahat chandra ke khilaaf aarope tay kiye the
 The court had said that Chandra cheated the Department of Telecommunications by acquiring the license while eight companies of the group were not eligible for the license at the time of application
 nichali adaalat ne kaha tha ki prathamdrishtya lagata he ki unitech wirelas (tamilnadu) privet limited 2ji licenson ke liye ayogy thi or license hasil karne ke tatkaal baad share bechakar company ne galat tarah se bade str par laabh hasil kiya

 Continuing the attack on the nehru-gandhi family, Smriti said that despite losing to Rahul in Amethi, he has paid the first premium of 25,000 residents of Amethi under the Prime Minister Suraksha Bima Yojana from his pocket
 unhone kaha, ‘

 'smriti said,' and now a winning candidate is asking a losing candidate for the development of his constituency
 
 a constituency that his family has controlled for more than 60 years
 ’ The Union Minister said that she was expecting such an attack as she was in Amethi on Tuesday
 smriti ne aadiaiti ke bare main ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha, ‘main yah baat pehle bhi kah chuki hum ki kam se kam meri upasthiti kii vajah se hi amethi main gandhi parivaar adhik dikhaayi degaa
 And my statement is proving true
 ’ He wondered whether the Congress believes that 'mr
 Gandhi is not capable enough to defend his own territory and needs additional ammunition
 ’ nehru-gandhi parivaar par hamalaa jari rakhte hue smriti ne kaha ki amethi main rahul se haarane ke baavjood unhone apni jeb se pradhanmantri suraksha beemaa yojana ke tahat amethi ke 25 hajaar nivaasiyon kaa pehla premium chukaaya he
 They said, '

 Bihari will no longer be a master saab in Jharkhand
 ye baat ham nahin kah rahe balki yah jharkhand ke shiksha mantri kaa bayaan he
 In fact, the Minister has opened a box of controversies by talking about changes in the appointment rules of teachers in the state
 isamen kaha gaya he jin parikshawrthiyon ne bhojpuri or magahi se niyukti pariksha paas kii he unka parikshafal radd kar diya jayega
 In such a situation, the future of thousands of candidates passed from these languages is hanging in the balance
 vahiin is mudde par raajnneeti bhi jamkar shuru ho gayi he
 In fact, this statement of Education Minister of Jharkhand Geetashree Oraon is in the news these days that the appointment of students who test from Magahi and Bhojpuri will be canceled
 shiksha mantri ne ye bayaan mantralay ko bhi jari kar diya he
 Geeta, who became the first MLA and Minister in Jharkhand, is in the elite team of Mr
 Rahul Gandhi and belongs to the strong political family of Jharkhand
 geethashri kaa saaf kahana he ki bhojpuri or magahi koi bhashaa nahin he, balki mahaj boli he
 In such a situation, there is no place in Jharkhand for the masters of these subjects
 gauratlab he kii rajya main ek dashak ke baad hui shikshak niyukti pariksha (JTET) main lagbhag 65 hajaar abhyarthiyon ko safal ghoshit kiya gaya tha or inaki niyukti kii prakriya bhi shuru ho gayi thi
 Meanwhile, a new controversy has started in the state over the change of rules of the Education Minister and it has given rise to a long-standing localism and linguistic issue in the state
 mantri mahodaya kaa ye bhi kahana he ki bihar rajya pehle hi niyukti niyamavali se jharkhandi bhashaaon ko hataa chukaa he, aise main unhone kuch bhi galat nahin kiya he
 At the same time, politics has also started on this issue
 jahaan sthaneey adivasee sanghathan is kadam kaa swaagat kar rahe hai vahiin rajya kaa ek tabaka isse kaaphi khafa he
 At the same time, in view of elections, political parties are making statements on this issue, assessing their profit and loss
 rajya ke purv mukhyamantri arjuna munda kaa kahana he ki ye sarkaar nahin chaahati he ki dusre kshetreey bhashaa jaanane vaale koi shikshak kii naukari kare
 Actually JTET i
e
 Teacher Appointment Examination was conducted during Munda's tenure
 us samay rajya sarkaar ne jilavaar boli janevaali kshetreey bhashaaon ke aadhaar par abhyarthiyon se aavedan maanga tha
 Surprisingly, teachers were appointed in Jharkhand almost a decade ago
 iske baad hui ekmaatr niyukti pariksha ko galat prakriya ke chalate jharkhand hoicourt ne radd kar diya tha
 It seems that this time also the matter of appointment will be caught in the screw of localism

 If Team India loses this match then they will have only one match against Sri Lanka and if they win that match even with bonus points, then their way to the final will not be easy
 srilanka iske baad austrailia se bhi haar jaataa he to bharat or srilanka donon ne samaan 15 ank ho jaaenge
 a net run rate will be seen in a situation in which Sri Lanka's position is currently very strong
 bharat agar ravivaar ko jeet jaataa he to uske austrailia ke baraabar ank ho jaaenge or aise main donon tiimon ke antim lig mukaable kaaphi ahm ho jaaenge
 Now the top-ranked Sri Lanka can also be out of the final race provided either India and Australia win both their remaining matches and one team wins one match
 bharat ko ravivaar ko austrailia kaa saamana karnaa he, jabaki iske baad use 28 farvari ko srilanka se bhidana he
 The final league match of the series will be played between Australia and Sri Lanka on March 2
 philhal bharat ke 10, austrailia ke 14 or srilanka ke 15 ank hai
 Right now India is least likely to reach the final
 bhartiya team chah maichon main se teen main apane cote ke puure over khilne main bhi naakaam rahi he jabaki uske gendbaaj kisi bhi match main virdohi team ke sabhi ballebaajon ko out nahin kar paae
 The fit of only two fast bowlers for Sunday's match has added to India's difficulty
 jahir khan pindli kii chot ke kaaran anuplabdh hai jabaki shrinkhalaa main bharat kii ore se sarvaadhik wicket chatakaane vaale aar vinay kumaar kaa bhi mansapeshiyon main khinchaav ke kaaran khelnaa sandigdh he
 Praveen Kumar is fit but his speed has decreased and now he does not seem as effective as before
 umesh yadav ko strike gendbaaj ke rup main dekha jaataa he lekin maujuuda shrinkhalaa main chaar maichon main vah 68 ke ausat or chah ran prati over se adhik kii ichonami rate se keval teen vikat chatkaar vifal rahe hai
 He has speed and movement but lacks consistency in line and length
 philhal kii sthiti main nayi gend kii jimmedaari umesh or irfan pathan ke kandhe par hogi
 If India go down with the third fast bowler, then Praveen has to be trusted
 yaa phir leg spinner rahul sharma ko mauka dena hoga
 Another important problem of India is the top three batsmen
 inke bich roteshan pranali ke baavjood team india ko ab tak salaami jodi se upyogi yogadan nahin mila he
 The best opening partnership for India was against Australia in Adelaide when Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag added 52 runs to help the team reach the target of 270 runs under the floodlight
 sachin tendulkar or sahvaag shrinkhalaa main buree tarah vifal rahe hai or kramash: 90 or 30 ran hi bana paae hai
 However, Gambhir has played more than 90 runs on two occasions
 viraat kohli ne kuch acchhee paariyaan khelkar apni pratibha ko sabit karne kii koshish kii he lekin rohit sharma or suresh raina kramash: 79 or 134 ranon ke saath shrinkhalaa main vifal rahe hai
 Indian batsmen have not lived up to expectations
 captain mahendra singh dhoni ne haalanki kuch maukon par acchhee pari khelkar finishr kii apni bhoomika bakhubi nibhaai he
 India's best score in six matches was to reach a target of 270 against Australia, while against Sri Lanka, it struggled to reach around 230
 brisben main austrailia ke khilaaf pichley hafte to team keval 178 ran bana saki
 Dhoni, however, has indicated that India may field all three openers Tendulkar, Sehwag and Gambhir in the match on Sunday
 isse sanket jate hai ki rohit sharma kaa baahar baithna lagbhag tay he
 On the other hand, the Australian batsmen have also faced problems
 team ne apane chah main se teen match ganvaae hai jisamen se do match srilanka ke khilaaf hai
 Australia's top order has also failed to score runs like India, while its bowlers have failed to penetrate the defense of the opposing batsmen
 david warner or mathew vade kii salaami jodi naakaam rahi he
 Warner 20 in six matches
 16 ke ausat se 121 jabaki vade ne 24
 Has scored 149 runs at an average of 83

 Warner, however, may have to make room for Shane Watson, who was fit in the playing XI
 austrailia kii ballebaaji ab tak puri tarah uske madhya kram par nirbhar rahi he
 Peter Forrest, who came in at number three in place of Ricky Ponting, scored a century in the last match while Michael Clarke, recovering from injury, also played a good innings
 hasi bandhu maaikel or david bhi acchhee farm main he
 The bowling of the team may have some problems though
 bel hilphenhaas, brett lee or reyaan haris kii tikdi shuukravaar raat srilanka ke khilaaf beleriv ovel main 280 ran ke score kaa bachaav karne main vifal rahi
 However, the Australian fast bowlers have been successful against India

 Addressing global investors here, he said that the government will implement many decisions and changes till the election comes
 chidambaram pichley saptaah se vishwa ke niveshkon se milane nikle hue hai or is kram main niveshkon ke saath unki yah chauthi bathak thi
 Chidambaram said that during these meetings, investors voiced doubts on political stability and the government's ability to pursue reforms

 "after the meeting, Chidambaram told reporters," i assured him that there is still 15 months left for the elections to be held and the general budget will be presented in February which will be a responsible budget and many decisions will be implemented in it
 ’chidambaram ne kaha ki niveshkon kii is chintaa kaa koi aadhaar nahin he ki ‘ham kuch bhi kahen chunaav ko dekhte hue ham apni jimmedaari darkinar kar denge
 He said that if we look at the number of people attending the conference and the questions they have asked, then it is clear that there is enough interest in people for India

 The feud between Ravi Shastri and Saurabh Ganguly for the last few days has raised many questions
 aisa pehali baar hua jab coach ke chayan ko lekar koi do bade khilaadi aamane-saamne hue
 This quarrel has created a mess for the BCCI, but the media has been taking advantage of the quarrel and is trying to garner trps
 anil kumble kaa coach ke rup main chayan hone ke baad unako lekar jitani charchaa nahin hui usase zyada charchaa ravi shastri or saurabh ganguli ke bich hue manmutav ko lekar hui
 The media presented the quarrel as if there was no news other than this
 coach na banane par ravi shastri ne media se baat karte hue kai prashnon ke jawaab die lekin media ne sirf ravi shastri ke dwaara saurabh ganguli ke upar uthaae gaye sawaalon ko hi zyada gaharaai se liya
 Not just the media, many former cricketers also appeared to be involved in this quarrel
 kuch khilaadi saurabh ganguli ke saath khadey hue nazar aae to kuch ravi shastri ke saath
 It felt like two teams were formed
 ek team ke captain saurabh ganguli hai or duusari team ke captain ravi shastri
 Then it was reported in the media that Ravi Shastri's name was offered as the batting coach of Team India
 ek bade akhbaar ne pehle is khabar ko apane panne par jagah di
 But there was no official statement about it
 is bare main na ravi shastri kuch bol rahe the, na salaahkaar samiti kaa koi sadsy, na bisisiai
 But still this news was dominated in the media
 kuch din pehle enditivi ne jab bisisiai ke sachiv ajay shirke se is khabar kii pushti karne kii koshish kii to shirke ne ek esemes ke jariye yah pushti kii thi ki salaahkaar samiti kaa kaam sirf head coach chunanaa he, batting coach nahin
 Shirke did not confirm whether the advisory committee had offered Ravi Shastri's name as the batting coach or not? phir media dwaara yah sawaal uthaaya gaya ki agar shastri ke naam kii batting coach ke rup main peshkash kii gai thi to phir vah batting coach kyon nahin bane
 The media also questioned Shastri
 yah bhi bataaya gaya ki shastri anhakaari hai or apane ghamand kii vajah se batting coach nahin ban rahe hai
 But the truth is that the main task of the member of the advisory committee was to choose the head coach and not the batting coach
 yah head coach kaa kaam hota he ki vah apane sahaayak staff chune, pehle bhi aisa ho chukaa he
 Today again, this news is covered in the media
 kai akhabaaron main yah khabar chhapi he ki saurabh ganguli ne yah kaha he ki batting coach ke rup main salaahkaar samiti ne ravi shastri ke naam kii peshkash kii thi
 Many newspapers have presented this news differently
 phir is maamle par ghi daalane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Ganguly has spoken on many issues, including many important issues, but the headline is only about the batting coach
 ganguli kaa bayaan aane ke baad ab is maamle ko yaheen khatm kar dena chahie
 At least, it became clear that the advisory committee had offered Ravi Shastri's name as a batting coach
 ab yah bhi saaf ho gaya he ki saurabh ganguli kaa ravi shastri ke saath koi manmutav nahin he
 If that were the case, Ravi Shastri's name would not have been offered
 tippaniyan Looking at this entire matter, on 1 June 2016, an advertisement for the Head Coach of Team India was removed by the BCCI
 kai bade-bade khilaadiyon ne aavedan kiye the jisamen ravi shastri,anil kumble, praveen aamare,sandip patel, cricketer tom mudi, stuart lau jaise shandaar khilaadi shaamil the
 On June 21, Saurabh Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman, members of the advisory committee set up by the BCCI to select coaches, had interviewed the players and stamped on Anil Kumble's name
 team india ke diarector ke rup main safal rahe ravi shastri is nirnay se naaraaz the
 He expressed his displeasure by coming to the media
 iske baad ravi shastri ne saurabh ganguli par aarope lagaaya ki unke intervyuu ke dauraan ganguli maujuud nahin the or aisa karke unhone ravi shastri kaa apmaan kiya he
 At first, Ganguly remained silent on this matter, but on 29 June, Ganguly attacked Ravi Shastri
 ganguli kaa kahana tha ki agar shastri yah sochate hai ki ganguli kii vajah se vah coach nahin ban paae to vah moorkhon kii duniya main ji rahe hai
 Ganguly also said that if Ganguly himself was not present during the interview, Ravi Shastri was also not
 yah bataa den ki ravi shastri ne skip ke jariye intervyuu diya tha
 Shastri was holidaying in Bangkok while the interview was going on
 shastri ke intervyuu ke dauraan ganguli bhi maujuud nahin the kyonki vah bengal cricket association kii kisi meeting main vah vyast the
 After the selection of Anil Kumble as coach, there was more discussion about him than the discussion between Ravi Shastri and Saurabh Ganguly
 media ne is jhagade ko aise pesh kiya jaise is khabar ke alaava or koi khabar nahin he
 Ravi Shastri answered several questions while talking to the media about not becoming a coach, but the media only took more deeply the questions raised by Ravi Shastri over Saurabh Ganguly
 sirf media nahin kai purv cricketer bhi is jhagade main shaamil hote nazar aae
 Some players were seen standing with Saurabh Ganguly and some with Ravi Shastri
 aisa laga ki do team ban gai hai
 One team captain is Saurabh Ganguly and the other team captain is Ravi Shastri
 phir media main yah khabar ai ki team india ke batting coach ke rup main ravi shastri ke naam kii peshkash kii gai thi
 a big newspaper first put this news on its page
 lekin iske bare main koi aadhikarik vaktavy nahin aayaa tha
 Neither Ravi Shastri was speaking about this, nor any member of the advisory committee, nor the BCCI
 lekin phir bhi yah khabar media main chai hui thi
 a few days ago when NDTV tried to confirm the news from BCCI Secretary Ajay Shirke, Shirke had confirmed through an SMS that the work of the advisory committee was only to choose the head coach and not the batting coach
 shirke ne yah pushti nahin kii thi ki salaahkaar samiti ne batting coach ke rup main ravi shastri ke naam kii peshkash kii gai tha yaa nahin? Then the question was raised by the media that if Shastri's name was offered as a batting coach then why did he not become a batting coach
 media ne shastri par bhi sawaal uthaaya
 It was also told that Shastri is infatuated and is not becoming a batting coach due to his pride
 lekin sach yah he ki salaahkaar samiti ke sadsy kaa jo mukhya kaary tha vah tha head coach chunanaa na ki batting coach
 It is the job of the head coach to elect his support staff, which has already happened
 aaj phir yah khabar media main chai hui he
 It has been reported in many newspapers that Saurabh Ganguly has stated that the advisory committee had offered Ravi Shastri's name as the batting coach
 kai akhabaaron ne is khabar ko alag rup main prastut kiya he
 Then there is an attempt to pour ghee on this matter
 ganguli ne kai muddon par baat kii he jisamen kai ahm mudde bhi shaamil hai, lekin hadeline sirf batting coach ko lekar he
 After the statement of Ganguly, now this matter should be ended here
 kam se kam yah saaf ho gaya ki salaahkaar samiti ne ravi shastri ke naam kii batting coach ke rup main peshkash kii thi
 Now it has also become clear that Saurabh Ganguly has no estrangement with Ravi Shastri
 agar aisa hota to ravi shastri ke naam kii peshkash nahin kii jaati
 The comments is puure maamle par nazar daalen to 1 june 2016 ko bisisiai kii taraf se team india ke head coach ke liye vigyaapan nikaala gaya tha
 Many big players had applied which included such brilliant players as Ravi Shastri, Anil Kumble, Praveen Amre, Sandeep Patel, Cricketer Tom Moody, Stuart Law
 21 june ko bisisiai kii taraf se coach chunane ke liye banaai gai salaahkaar samiti ke sadsy saurabh ganguli, sachin tendulkar or vivies lakshmana ne khilaadiyon kaa intervyuu liya tha or anil kumble ke naam par mohar lagaai thi
 Ravi Shastri, who succeeded Team India as a director, was angered by this decision
 unhone media ke saamne aakar apana naaraazgi jataai thi
 Ravi Shastri then accused Saurabh Ganguly that Ganguly was not present during his interview and by doing so he insulted Ravi Shastri
 pehle to ganguli is maamle par chup rahe lekin 29 june ko ganguli ne ravi shastri par hamalaa bol diya
 Ganguly said that if Shastri thinks that he could not become a coach because of Ganguly, then he is living in a world of fools
 ganguli ne yah bhi kaha tha ki agar ganguli khud intervyuu ke dauraan maujuud nahin the to ravi shastri bhi nahin the
 Please tell that Ravi Shastri gave the interview through Skype
 jab intervyuu chal rahaa tha tab shastri bangkok main chhuttiyaan manaa rahe the
 Ganguly was also not present during Shastri's interview as he was busy in a meeting of the Bengal Cricket Association
 coach na banane par ravi shastri ne media se baat karte hue kai prashnon ke jawaab die lekin media ne sirf ravi shastri ke dwaara saurabh ganguli ke upar uthaae gaye sawaalon ko hi zyada gaharaai se liya
 Not just the media, many former cricketers also appeared to be involved in this quarrel
 kuch khilaadi saurabh ganguli ke saath khadey hue nazar aae to kuch ravi shastri ke saath
 It felt like two teams were formed
 ek team ke captain saurabh ganguli hai or duusari team ke captain ravi shastri
 Then it was reported in the media that Ravi Shastri's name was offered as the batting coach of Team India
 ek bade akhbaar ne pehle is khabar ko apane panne par jagah di
 But there was no official statement about it
 is bare main na ravi shastri kuch bol rahe the, na salaahkaar samiti kaa koi sadsy, na bisisiai
 But still this news was dominated in the media
 kuch din pehle enditivi ne jab bisisiai ke sachiv ajay shirke se is khabar kii pushti karne kii koshish kii to shirke ne ek esemes ke jariye yah pushti kii thi ki salaahkaar samiti kaa kaam sirf head coach chunanaa he, batting coach nahin
 Shirke did not confirm whether the advisory committee had offered Ravi Shastri's name as the batting coach or not? phir media dwaara yah sawaal uthaaya gaya ki agar shastri ke naam kii batting coach ke rup main peshkash kii gai thi to phir vah batting coach kyon nahin bane
 The media also questioned Shastri
 yah bhi bataaya gaya ki shastri anhakaari hai or apane ghamand kii vajah se batting coach nahin ban rahe hai
 But the truth is that the main task of the member of the advisory committee was to choose the head coach and not the batting coach
 yah head coach kaa kaam hota he ki vah apane sahaayak staff chune, pehle bhi aisa ho chukaa he

 ' The counsel for Sarabjit Singh, an Indian prisoner lodged in a Pakistani jail, said on Saturday that he had received death threats from the Taliban after seeing Sarabjit's case
 sarbajit ko pakistani adaalat maut kii sajaa suna chuki he
 Sarabjit's lawyer Awais Sheikh said that an unknown activist of the banned organization tehreek-e-taliban, Pakistan, wrote a letter warning his wife to refuse her husband to look into Sarabjit's case
 shaikh ke anusaar patr main likhaa he, main taharike taliban pakistan se judaa hum or main faisalabad jile kaa nivasee hum
 i want to tell you that your husband is advocating the case of Sarabjit, who is responsible for the death of my entire family in the bombings
 tippaniyan It is written in the letter, your husband is holding a press conference about Sarabjit Singh
 yadi aisa hota he, to yah aapako pati ke liye antim din hoga or aapke parivaar ke harek sadsy ko maar diya jayega
 You will see the bus bodies of your children tomorrow morning 
 patr main likhaa gaya he, main aapke bacchon ko jaanata hum
 i will kidnap them and send their bodies to you

 This is an important achievement for us as we are starting the show in the early hours of the evening
 hamen bharosa he ki darshak ise pasand karenge
 ' notebandi par malaham kaa intjaar shuru ho gaya he lekin pen killer kii talash sabsidi or inakam tex kii puraani dukaanon main hi ho rahi he yani ki aam logon ke khate main kuch paise yaa mutthi bhar ykardaataaon ko riyaayaton kaa chuuran
 Demonetisation is the boldest experiment in the latest history of India and the way to end its ill effects should be equally bold
 notebandi kaa vaastavik maraham pradhanmantri kii mej par rakhaa he basharte ve use aajamaane kii himmat juta saken
 The name of that ointment is GST
 jiesti abhi sarkaar kii taksaal main he jo notebandi kaa sabase kaamyaab dard nivarak ho saktaa he basharte ise hakeekat main krantikari sudhaar main badal diya jaae
 Good GST can bring back demand, change the investment climate and cure black money challenge that will exist even after demonetisation
 lekin jiesti kaa abhi jo praaroop hamaare saamne he, uske lagu hone par na keval notebandi kii takaliphen doguni ho jaaengi balki kaale dhan kii musiibat or bad sakati hai
 How can a good GST be a game-changer against the problems of demonetisation? Consumption in India attracts a lot of tax
 exise, sarvice tex, waite aadi ko milakar na keval kai kism ke tex hai balki unki kai daren hai
 Most of the black money is consumed by evasion of taxes on trade
 vyapaaree tex dena chaahate hai lekin kaarobaar laagat behad oonchi he
 The tax burden limits the margin of profit so theft occurs
 kai staron par lagane vaala tex mahangaai main teji or maang main kami kii vajah he
 GST is being treated as a cure for all these problems
 lekin jiesti council ne jis tex dhaanche ko manjuuri di he usamen teen jiesti (centre, state or interstate) or paanch daren (0, 5,12,18 or 28 fisadi) hai
 The Central Government will impose cess on it
 rajya bhi ses lagaana chaahate hai yani jiesti gemeanger nahin balki maujuuda tex dhaanche jaisaa ho jayega
 In GST, the manufacturer and seller will get back the taxes paid on raw or finished goods so that the end consumer can be saved from the tax and tax on tax
 lekin kai daron vaala jiesti input credit ko behad jatil or kaarobaariyon ke liye chunauti banane vaala he
 So the courage that is required from the government now is this: Only two tax rates should be kept in GST
 na ki teen tarah ke jiesti, koi ses na anya tex
 One rate for general consumption products and services and one for luxury products
 yah 12 or 18 fisadi ho sakati hai
 Abolition of all types of tax concessions
 na koi turnover chhot seemaa, na kisi udyog ke liye vishesh chhot
 Three-compulsory registration under GST for all types of small and big businesses, such as PAN is mandatory for common people
 yah badlaav sambhav hai kyonki jiesti kaa kanoon abhi sansad nahin pahunchaa he
 If we get such a GST, then many demonetisation losses can be offset: Notebook has broken consumption and demand
 jiesti kaa maujuuda swaroop tex kaa boj ghataane main koi bada yogadan nahin karegaa, jabaki do daron vaale jiesti se badi maatra main utpaadan va sevaayen sasti hongi
 This can give new strength to demand while keeping inflation under control
 yah likhane kii jarurat nahin ki ooncha tex, chori or kaale dhan kii vajah he
 Under the current GST, traders will have to register 30 to 60 and file returns
 isse compliance cost badaae kaa dar he
 a good seamless GST will free many types of return registration
 sabhi kaarobaariyon ke liye anivaary registration ke jariye har tarah ke utpaadan, vitaran or khapat ko tex kii nigaah main laayaa ja saktaa he yani ki vah kaam ho saktaa he jise notebandi nahin kar pai
 Low tax and registration of all traders is a guarantee of higher revenue for the states
 rajyon ko hone vaale nuksaan kii bharpai kii guarantee centre sarkaar pehle hi de chuki he
 Low tax, high demand and ease of doing business - this is what is needed for investment
 jiskaa maahaul notebandi ne khatm kar diya he
 Common people have done penance under demonetisation
 ab jiesti ko bada sudhaar banane ke liye sarkaar ko tyaag or tapasya kerani hogi
 Expenses will have to be reduced, government companies will have to be privatized, losses will have to be reduced and there will be a habit of sucking the consumption by imposing heavy taxes and cesses on consumption
 kya pradhanmantri narendra modi ne nitigat lakshya sahi chune hai? is sawaal kaa jawaab to itihaas degaa lekin notebandi or jiesti ke bich tulana karne par yah mahasoos karnaa mushkil nahin he ki jiesti ko krantikari banane ke bajaae sarkaar ne notebandi ke jariye growth ke pairon par kulhadi markar mandi va bekaari ko nyotaa de diya
 a low-tax GST can bring business transparency, which is the first condition to curb black money
 bachaa hua kaam nakad len-dein or nakadi va sona rakhane kii seemaa tay karne, accounting sudhaar, jameen-sone kii kharid par pahchaan anivaary karne va rajnatik chandon main paardarshita ke jariye ho saktaa he
 The GST, which is involved in a feud between the Center and the states, needs the Prime Minister's political leadership
 yadi ve desh ko sahaj or kam mahangaai vaala tex system de sake to yah na keval aarthik udaarikaran ke baad bharat kii sabase badi uplabdhi hogi balki yah notebandi se kahin bada or doorgaami sudhaar sabit hoga, jiskaa intjaar desh barason se kar rahaa he

 Tendulkar used to sit next to the driver and used to tell him that your father is a big star
 tour ke aakhri main meraa betaa bhi star ban gaya
 He is just 21 years old
 use bharat sarkaar kii ore se dhanyavad vaala ek letters mila
 ' gauratlab he ki jeff gudwin england tour ke dauraan zyaadaatar cricket tiimon kii bas chalaate hai
 He started running the team bus from the 1999 World Cup and gave excellent service
 haalanki suresh raina ne jo kiy wo tarif ke kaabil he
 It is worth noting that Jeff Goodwin drives the bus of most cricket teams during the England tour
 unhone 1999 world cap se team kii bas chalaanaa shuru kiya or behtareen sarvice di
 However, what Suresh Raina did is praiseworthy
 'main australian prashansakon se apil karata hum ki ve sidney cricket stadium ko pile rang se rang den
 We need you with us ' This tweet is from Australia's captain Michael Clarke
 clark ko dar he ki guuruuvaar ko semifinal ke din australia se zyada bhartiya samarthak sidney cricket ground pahunch sakate hai
 When the competition between two teams is considered to be equal, often the role of 'restlessness' becomes important in such a big match and there is no need to tell who is more 'restless' here
 pareshaani kii or bhi vazahe hai
 In school, you too may have read about 'surface tension' ie 'surface tension'
 sidney cricket ground kaa 22 gaj kaa 'sarfes' bhi 'tension' badha rahaa he
 The tension on Clark's face can also be read, but the face of Captain Cool Mahendra Singh Dhoni is also zero this time
 darasal sidney cricket ground kii pich kii amuman spin gendbaazon se dosti rahi he
 But the pitch in the World Cup is confusing everyone with his mood
 yahaan srilanka ke kilaaf match main australia ne left arm orthodox xavier dohetri ko utaara to unhen ek bhi wicket nahin mila
 That day, 688 runs were scored in the match between Australia and Sri Lanka
 dakshin africa ne westeindies ke kilaaf sidney kii pich par hi 408 ran banaae
 Proteas leg-spinner Imran Tahir made five wickets against the West Indies and four against Sri Lanka
 part timer of spinner jepi dumini ne hetric bhi lagaayi thi
 Pakistan captain misbah-ul-haq further misled the Kangaroos on his way
 vah kah gaye ki maujhuuda champion bharat or mezbaan australia ke bich semifinal kaa nateeja spinners tay karenge
 Now the Australian team feel that their own pitch can support the enemy team
 dar lag rahaa he ki kahin vishwa champion banane kii unki ummiido par pich pani na pher de
 Therefore, Australia has demanded a 'green top'
 unki is maang se bhartiya kheme main thodi bechaini honi lazimi he
 a major reason behind Team India's seven wins in seven matches is also that this time the ICC has prepared most of the batting wickets for the World Cup
 isisi kii soch rahi he ki zyaada manoranjan ke liye zyaada ran banane chahie
 In the 46 matches played till the quarterfinal, three times scored more than 400 runs and 24 times more than 300 runs
 pehali baar kisi world cap main do ballebaazon ne dohare shatak thok daale
 It is unlikely that the pitch will be changed at the last minute
 isisi pravaktaa ne saafe kiya he, 'pich curator kisi team ke anurodh ko nahin maan saktaa
 He has been asked to produce 'sporting wickets'
 ab tak unhone ye hi kiya he
 ' pich chaahe jaisi bhi ho, australia ke ulat bhartiya team ke aatmavishvaas main kami nazar nahin aa rahi
 In seven matches, Indian bowlers have surprised everyone by taking all 70 wickets
 australia kii gendbaazi majboot to he, lekin usamen bharat kii tarah vividhta nahin he
 Australia relies on fast bowlers, India has medium pacers and spinners as well as part timers like Suresh Raina and Rohit Sharma who can surprise Australian batsmen like Duminy
 pakistan ke tej gendbaaz wahaab riyaaz dikhaa chuke hai ki kangaaroon ke kile main send lagaana mushkil to he, lekin naammumkin nahin
 Wahab's stellar performance in the quarterfinal is still under discussion
 29 saal ke lahore ke wahaab ne apni short pich gendon se australia ko daraa diya tha
 David Warner and Michael Clarke took the wickets as well as Shane Watson's catch could not have changed the result of the match
 haalanki bharat ke purv tej gendbaazi coach jo doj ashankit hai
 He does not think that either Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Shami and Mohit Sharma can upset Australian batsmen like Wahab Riaz
 doj kaa maananaa he ki bhartiya gendbaaz wahaab riyaaz ko doharaa nahin paaenge
 He says, 'they must be doing their homework
 dancan flechar behad chaalaak coach hai
 They will keep an eye on these things
 lekin wahaab kii tarah bharat ke paas baayen haath kaa gendbaaz nahin he
 ' world cap main sabase zyada wicket lene vaale pehle do gendbaaz baayen haath ke hai
 Mohammed Shami has taken 17 wickets at an average of 13 so far, after New Zealand's Trent Boult and Australia's Mitchell Starc
 captain mahendra singh dhoni ke dhairya ke alaava ek or kaarak he jo match kaa paksh bharat kii ore mode saktaa he vah he viraat kohli kaa chalanaa
 If the vice-captain Kohli spoke in the semi-finals, there would be no difficulty in changing 'we don't give it back' to 'we don't give it back'

 Now Tata Sons has made a fresh accusation on Cyrus Mistry, saying that he misled the selection committee set up in 2011 to select a new chairman in place of Ratan Tata

 shatrughna sinha, yani bijepi ke 'bihari babu', in dinon apni hi party se naaraaz chal rahe hai, or aisa unke us bayaan se saaf pataa chalaa, jab unhone virdohi aam aadmi party kii tarif kar daali
 Shatrughan Sinha, who was campaigned for the party for the Delhi assembly elections 2015, clearly said, "if questions are being raised about 'AAP', it means 'AAP' is showing strength
" 
 
 mumbaiya style main kahuun to 'aap' kaa booma-boom ho rahaa he
 
 
 The grip of 'AAP' is visible
 
 
 " It is clear from his statements that he is not missing out on targeting the top leadership of the party, especially Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party chief Amit Shah on the pretext of campaigning
 shatrughna sinha ne isse pehle bhi apane har intervyuu main virodhiyon se zyada apni hi party kii bakhiya udhedi he
 Whether it was praising Arvind Kejriwal, or suggesting that the party should not campaign negatively
 
 
 chaahe yah kahana rahaa ho ki kiran bedi ke sthaan par harshavardhan mukhyamantri pad ke behatar umidavaar hote, yaa yun kahana ki chande ke naam par 'aap' ko gherna sahi ranneeti nahin he
 But the real question is why 'bihari Babu' is angry
 party netaaon kii maane to unki naaraazgi ke do pramukh kaaran hai - pehla, party ne unhen dilli se pehle maharashtra or jharkhand main prachaar ke laayak nahin samajha, jabaki manoj tiwari ko star prachaarak banaaya, jinhone vahaan 40 se adhik sabhaaon ko sambodhit kiya
 Apart from this, 'bihari Babu' also wanted Modi Sircar to give him 'padma Vibhushan', and for this he had also recommended his name to the Jitam Ram Manjhi government of Bihar, but if the close of 'bihari Babu', the Prime Minister may be He had attended his son's wedding, but he also played an active role in rejecting his name
 so, aise main 'bihari babu' jab bhi media ke saamne aaenge yaa prachaar ke liye jaaenge to unki koshish rahegi ki virodhiyon se zyada unke bayanon se party ko nuksaan pahunche, or dilli main unhone aisa kar bhi dikhaaya
 While it is certain that if the Delhi election results are unfavorable for the BJP, then 'bihari Babu' will be more vocal in the coming days, while it is also sure that the party, especially the national president Amit Shah, will also take him to the margins
 i will leave no stone unturned

 In her statement to the court, Veenu Sandal said that she had known MJ Akbar for the last 25 years and she has been in the profession of journalism for so many years

 Actually, due to the Lok Sabha elections, there was a code of conduct and due to which no leader could give Iftar in the month of Ramadan
 ab chunaav ke saath hi ramajaan kaa maheenaa bhi khatm hone ko aayaa he
 It is being speculated that it is Eid on 5 or 6 June
 ab inhen do-chaar dinon main sabhi netaa iftaar party niptaana chaahate hai
 The situation is that two to three iftar parties are being held in Patna in a day and in any iftar that a leader does not reach, he comes in the news
 ab ravivaar ko up mukhyamantri or bihar main bijepi ke varisht netaa susheel kumaar modi kii ore se iftaar kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 Many leaders including Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Shahnawaz Hussain participated in it
 iske turant baad jediu kii ore se iftaar kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan and even Jitan Ram Manjhi participated in it
 jeethanram maanjhi jediu ke iftaar main aane se pehle argedy netaa or purv mukhyamantri rabari devi kii ore se yojit iftaar main hissaa le chuke the
 The leaders of the grand alliance were present in this iftar, but the absence of Tejashwi was surprising everyone here
 lekin in iftaar partiyon ke bich ek ghatana ko lekar kayaasabaaji shuru ho gai
 Actually what happened is that iftar party of BJP and JDU also took place
 jediu ke iftaar main na to bijepi kaa netaa dikhaa or jediu ke iftaar main na bijepi kaa netaa
 It is believed that the distance between the two parties is increasing
 kyonki modi mantrimandal main jahaan jediu ne shaamil hone se manaa kar diya tha to duusari ore nitish ke cabinet vistaar main bijepi ko jagah nahin mili he
 But it was not a big deal to go to Iftar because the leaders are meeting each other in Iftar parties that are happening continuously
 duusari ore kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ne kaha ki endie main koi vivaad nahin he
 Any problem with JDU joining the cabinet will be resolved soon
 paswan ne kaha ki nitish kumaar pehle bhi endie kaa cheharaa the or aage bhi rahenge
 However, Ram Vilas Paswan, an ally in NDA, is hopeful that the matter will be resolved
 is maamle main nitish kumaar or up susheel kumaar modi donon hi safai de chuke hai
 Meanwhile, JDU general secretary KC Tyagi said that JDU will never join the NDA cabinet in future

 ek dastavej main is baat kii sambhaavna jataai gai he ki china ne 1970 ke dashak ke antim vashren main apane kareebi sahyogi pakistan ko parmaanu hathiyaaron ke dizin kaa vyapak package muhaiyaa karaayaa or siie ko isaki jaankaree thi
 This document has been revealed recently
 soochna kii swatantraaa kanoon ke tahat rashtriya suraksha abhilekhaagaar (enese) se hasil kiye gaye in dastavejon ke anusaar, siai ke paas sakshya the, jo pakistan-china ke bich kareebi parmaanu sahyog kii ore ishaara karte hai
 According to this document, there have been allegations in the past, such as in a Foreign Ministry document and in many big news, but this is the first time that the CIA has released some of its information to the public
 tippaniyan It said, some major activities have been pointed out in this estimate, including 'verbal consent' to help Pakistan develop the capability of a nuclear explosion in 1974, developments such as providing nuclear weapons technology in the year 1976
 Huh
 saath hi kuch aisi suchanaaen hai, jinase yah sambhaavna banati he ki china ne parmaanu hathiyaar ke dizin sambandhi vyapak soochna muhaiyaa karai
 a 1983 national-level intelligence estimate by the CIA states that Pakistan is capable of building a nuclear weapon even without China's help, but China's weapon design and test data are a substantial boost to Islamabad's confidence in untested capability
 Can be important
 isamen kaha gaya he ki soochnaaon kaa yah pravaah shaayad ekatarfa nahin tha or pakistan ke parmaanu sanvardhan kaarykram main china kii ‘‘sanliptata’’ shaayad gas centriphyus takanic se sambandhit thi, jo pakistan ne china se lee
 The document stated that nuclear proliferation was a major part of Jimmy Carter's administration's policy and that US government officials were concerned by the possibility of a nuclear weapons partnership by Pakistan and China, but the CIA did not have solid evidence

 The comments isamen kaha gaya he, is anumaan main kuch mukhya gatividhiyon kii ore ishaara kiya gaya he, jinamein varsh 1974 main pakistan ko ek parmaanu visphot kii kshamta viksit karne main madad dene ko ‘maukhik sahmati’, varsh 1976 main parmaanu hathiyaar takanic muhaiyaa karaane jaise ghatnakram hai
 Also, there is some information that makes it likely that China provided comprehensive information about the design of nuclear weapons
 siie dwaara varsh 1983 ke rashtriya str ke ek khufia anumaan main kaha gaya he, china kii madad ke bina bhi pakistan ek parmaanu hathiyaar banane main sakasham he, lekin china ke hathiyaar dizin or pareekshan aankade bagaiyr pareekshan vaali kshamta main islamabad kaa aatmavishvaas badhaane main kaaphi mahatvapurn ho sakate hai
 It stated that this flow of information was probably not one-sided and that China's "involvement" in Pakistan's nuclear enrichment program was probably related to the gas centrifuges technology that Pakistan took from China
 dastavej main kaha gaya he ki parmaanu prasar jimi carter ke prashasan kii niti kaa ek pramukh hissaa tha or pakistan evam china dwaara parmaanu hathiyaaron se sambandhit saajhedaari kii sambhaavna se america sarkaar ke adhikari chintit ho uthe the, lekin siie ke paas ko thos saboot nahin the

 Uttarakhand, the Himalayan state of the country is in discussion these days for two reasons
 pehla- uttarakhand ke gadhwal or kumaun donon mandalon ke paryaton or dharmik sthalon ke aasapaas lagane vaale trephic jam se
 Second- from the royal wedding of a family of businessman Gupta brothers at Auli near Dehradun
 donon ghatnaayen jane-anjaane uttarakhand ke paryaavaran ko kharaab or pahaado ko kamjor karne kaa kaam kar rahi hai
 Uttarakhand is currently full of people at various religious and tourist places including Nainital, Bhawali, Mussoorie, Auli, Rishikesh, Kedarnath and Badrinath
 in dinon yahaan aas-paas ke rajyon se paryatak garmi se raahat or sukun kii talash main pahunch rahe hai
 These tourists coming from their private vehicles are providing income to the state in many ways, but also harming the environment
 vahiin, auli main gupta bandhuon ke parivaar kii shaadi main karodon rupee kharch kiye ja rahe hai
 The trend of pre-wedding shoots has also increased in this area of uttarakhand
 auli main gupta bandhu 200 helicopteron se apane mehmaanon ko badrinath ke darshan bhi karaane vaale hai
 It is a matter of concern that so many helicopters land together in a sensitive valley like Badrinath
 unke kampan or aawaaj se bhi pahaado par gambhir asar padegaa
 Roads jammed on the roads leading to Pahar Roorkee to Haridwar and Rishikesh were blocked almost every day last week
 weekend par to sthiti or buree thi
 Further, the roads along Badrinath and Kedarnath roads were so blocked that vehicles carrying petrol and diesel could not reach the petrol pumps and only 5-5 liters of fuel could be supplied to the people
 nainital jane vaali gadiyon ko police ne haldwani, kathgodam samet kai jagahon par roak diya or keval unheen logon ko aage jane diya, jinke paas hotel kii pre-booking thi

 isse garmi ke dinon main pahari ilaakon main bheed badhati gai jo ab kai ghanton ke jam main badal gai he
 He says cars are not available in the world's most expensive cities, Switzerland and Zurich
 vahaan kaa sara avaagaman saarvajanik parivahanon par nirbhar he
 People seeking religion, not religion and spirituality, environmentalist and author Sopan Joshi says that in the consumerist culture, the life of cities is shown very colorful, whereas in reality it does not happen
 inhen 5 din ke jivan se uubakar log weekend par do dinon ke liye najdiki hill steshnon par pahunch jate hai
 He says that earlier religious visits to the mountains used to be annoying, now the elements of religion and spirituality have been reduced in such journeys
 sopan kehete hai ki uttarakhand jaise sthanon par vyaktigat vaahanon ke bajaae sthaneey or saarvajanik vaahanon ko chalaaya jaae
 This will also solve the problem of both unemployment and migration on the mountains because these problems have not been solved only by tourism
 parking se hal nahin hogi samasyanainital ke jam ko rokane ke liye rajya ke mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat ek multistory parking kii ghoshnaa kar chuke hai
 It is being told that this parking with a capacity of about 1000 cars will solve the jam problem in the peak season
 lekin pahaado kii sankari sadakon ko chaudaa karne or parking banane se ye samasya hal nahin hogi
 Rajiv Lochan Sah says that only parking will not reduce the problem of jam
 kaaron kii sankhya har saal itani bad rahi he ki parking or sadaken kam pad jaaengi

 gangtok samet uttar-purv ke kai paryaton sthalon par horn bajaane par bhi roak he taaki dhwani tarangon se samvedansheel pahaado or junglee jeev-jantuon ko pareshaani na ho
 Similarly, individual vehicles are not allowed to go to Matheran, Maharashtra's hill station
 yahaan par aap paidal yaa ghode par savaar hokar hi pahunch sakate hai
 This has been done to protect this place from pollution and damage
 maharashtra ke hi elephant island par bhi vaahan nahin ja sakate hai
 It can be reached by boat and after that it can be visited on foot or by a small miniature train

 " In Ferozepur, Punjab, a case of stigmatizing relationships has come to light, which will surely lift your human confidence
 yahaan nashe main dhut ek yuvak ne apni 70 saal kii bujurg maa kaa hi rape kar diya
 Both mother and son live in the same house
 mili jaankaree ke mutabik, mahila ne apane bete ke khilaaf police menshikayat darjakarai he
 In her complaint, the elderly woman said that while she went for defecation, her son carried out this disgusting incident with her
 bujurg peedita ne bataaya ki ghatana ke vakt unka betaa nashe main tha
 The woman, hurt by this act of her son, decided to punish her
 peedita ne police ko ghatana kii soochna di
 The police immediately got the victim medical
 medical jaanch main peedita ke saath rape kii pushti hui
 Investigating officer Kashmir Singh said about this, he was arrested after registering a case of accused son Parape
 police maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Let us tell you that most of the youth in Punjab are so much engrossed in the fact that sometimes this issue speaks head on in the elections, but every time the result remains the cipher
 70 saal kii bujurg ke saath hui is sharmnaak harakat se ilaake ke log sakate main hai
 It has been barely a week since Narendra Modi became Prime Minister
 udhar maharashtra main bijepi apni sabase puraani sahyogi shivasena ke saath mukhyamantri pad ko lekar ulajh gai he
 Before the assembly elections, both the parties are giving their names to the contenders for the Chief Minister's post
 abhi tak bijepi shivasena ke bich samjhauta hota aayaa he ki vidhansabha chunaav shivasena 171 siton par or bijepi 117 siton par ladati he
 But now the Shiv Sena's elder brother is no longer in stature in the BJP state
 bijepi shivesna kii chaaya se baahar nikalnaa chaahati he
 Some BJP leaders feel that without Balasaheb the Shiv Sena has no other option
 bijepi jo bhi samjhauta kare shivasena ko usee ke saath rahanaa he
 That is why the names of Gopinath Munde and Devendra Fadnavis have started being tossed out by the BJP
 lekin shivasena apni jameen chhodane ko bilkul taiyaar nahin he
 Sanjay Raut has said that the party wants Uddhav Thackeray to become the Chief Minister
 unhone kaha ki maharashtra kaa aglaa siem unki party se hoga
 If anyone can change the state, then only the Shiv Sena can bring it
 par bijepi loksabhaa chunaav main mili jeet ke baad maan kar chal rahi he ki purana samjhauta ab nahin chalane vaala
 Negotiations on the seat and the chief minister's post will take place afresh
 is vivaad kii shuruyaat tab hui jab thode din pehle bijepi ne pradesh adhyaksh devendra fadanvis ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar banane kaa sanket die
 Fadnavis had said that Gopinath Munde would return to become the Chief Minister himself, the state sent him to the Center on loan
 jis par aaj saamana main chapa ki kya modi ko ye karj or udhaar kaa dhandha manjuur he
 People have prepared to become the Chief Minister
 balki bijepi main to is mudde par chintan baithak tak ho gai he
 This is important
 bijepi ke netaa devendra fadanvis ne to yahaan tak kah diya ki bijepi netaa gopinath munde ko dilli main teen maah ke liye udhaar par diya gaya he
 After three months they will be charged along with interest
 teen maheene baad munde ko rajya main le aaenge
 Now BJP workers are also saying that Narendra in the center and Devendra in the state
 is baat se kai netaaon ko chintaa hone lagi
 Rather Munde himself said, Devendra in the state of Narendra in the country
 munde kehete hai devendra uttam he or devendra kehete hai ki munde ko teen maheene ke udhaar par dilli bhej diya he
 But whether this new interest rate of BJP is acceptable to Narendra Modi, whoever will do careful and interest business, only the people of Maharashtra will do
 loksabhaa ke baad chunaav kaa manch chota ho gaya he lekin sidhasat ke hisaab se hasarat choti nahin he yahaan shivasena ke liye narendra modi myne nahin rakhte
 Balasaheb's dream is important here
 khud ko siem ghoshit karne isaki shuruyaat uddhav ke chote bhai raaj ne kii he
 He was the first to present himself as the Chief Ministerial contender in the elections to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly
 phir bade bade daavedaar aae
 On all previous occasions in Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena has got the chief minister's chair in the BJP Shiv Sena government
 lekin is baar bijepi aatmavishvaas se bhari hui he
 After a strong performance in the country, it looks certain to win the Maharashtra elections and the Chief Minister's chair is the truth of the near future
 lekin rajya kii siyasat main sameekaran jaraa uljhe hue hai vahaan daavedaari shivasena kii bhi utani hi majboot he

 muslim paksh kii ore se minakshi aroda, shekhar nafde ne kii bahesajaj bole- koi aisa puraatatv vigyaani he jo report nakaar saxyodhya vivaad ko lekar supreme court main rojaanaa sunwaayee jari he
 Meanwhile, the hearing took place on the 33rd day in the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi case on Friday
 muslim paksh kii taraf se minakshi aroda ne bahes kii shuruyaat karte hue kaha ki bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan (ASI) kii report par alag-alag visheshgyon kii alag-alag raay he
 He said that this scientist is less and more based on imagination
 minakshi ne kaha ki report se kahin sabit nahin hota ki vahaan gupt kaal kaa bhi nirmaan tha
 The palace that is being talked about is of medieval period
 unhone kaha ki aise main use 12veen sadi kaa mandir bataanaa galat he
 It is also not right to call him divine
 muslim paksh kii vakil ne kaha ki dhaanche par bana gol gumbad bhi chah pahaluon vaala tha
 Justice Nazir said, "can not question the authenticity of the report
 Justice Nazir said that you are saying that archeology is also not completely science, and section 45 does not apply to it
" unhone kaha ki ASI report kii jaanch kii gai or aapattiyon par vichaar kiya gaya
 You cannot question the authenticity of the report, as a commissioner who gave the report was a judge
 is tippanee par minakshi aroda ne kaha ki puraatatv vibhaag ne kaha he ki harek puraatatv adhikari apni soch ke hisaab se tasviir taiyaar karata he
 On the basis of that, he tries to reach a conclusion
 puraatatv vigyaan bilkul haderieting vigyaan kii tarj par hi anumaan par kaam karata he
 He said that the opinion of one archaeological scientist is not usually met by another
 minakshi ne kaha ki fingerprint kii jaanch bilkul sateek hoti he, kyonki milan kaa pratishat kahin zyada hone par ise sahi mana jaataa he
 Justice Bobde said, "there is an archaeologist who can deny the report
 Just do you have any archaeologist who can deny the report of ASI like you are denying?" is par minakshi aroda ne kaha ki hindu paksh kii ore se pesh gavaahon ki raay bhi puraatatv vibhaag se alag thi
 Jayanti Prasad Srivastava, retired archeology officer, kept the opinion on the basis of the department's report
 puure din kii jirah ke mahatvapurn bindu-justise bobade ne kaha ki donon hi pakshon ke paas koi pratyaksh sakshya nahin he
 The case of all sides rests on the point of view of the Archaeological Report
 aroda ne kaha ki puraatatv vibhaag ki report main kahin nahin kaha gaya ki amuk sthaan ram mandir he
 Whereas Ram Chaputre has been described as a water tank
 minakshi aroda ne apni daleelein puri kin
 The summary of Arora's pleas was that she asked the court not to rely completely on the ASI report
 minakshi aroda ne supreme court ke ek puraane faisle kaa hawala dete hue puraatatv vibhaag kii report ko galat sabit karne kii koshish kii
 After Meenakshi, lawyer Shekhar Nafde started a debate on behalf of Muslim parties
 shekhar nafde ne kaha ki farrukh ahamed kii ore se 1961 main daayar yachika par sunwaayee karte hue nichali adaalat dwaara diya gaya res jeudi kaata yani nyaayik samiksha kaa antim aadesh he
 Raghubar Das filed suit for the construction of the temple
 jinaki ore se chabutare ko janm sthaan qaraar dete hue mandir nirmaan ki maang kii gai
 He also gave his details
 dipti kamishnar ne 1885 main raghubar das ke suut par apana faisla diya tha or chabutare par mandir banane kaa daawa khaarij kar diya tha
 In such a case, this race is a case of judicial review
 (res jeudi kaata (section 11 of CPC) kaa matlab he 'do pakshakaron ke bich kisi vivaad kaa nipataara ho jane ke baad unheen pakshakaron ke bich usee maamle main usee vivaad ke liye dobaaraa suut daakhil nahin kiya ja saktaa
 ) Justice Bobde said that one thing is clear that there was a dispute over possession
 to kya vivaad sirf ram chabutare kaa tha yaa puure sthaan kaa?nafde ne kaha ki hinduon kaa vahaan thodi si jameen par adhikaar tha
 They only had authority over the Ram platform, they were trying to gain ownership which was rejected
 unhone atikaraman karne ke liye lagaataar prayaas kiya
 Nafde said that the judicial commissioner had made it clear in his order that Hindus had limited access to the area
 vah use badhaane kaa prayaas kar rahe the, lekin yah chinhit hua ki unka adhikaar simit he or unhen malikana haq nahin diya ja saktaa
 Shekhar Nafde said that the 1885 suit filed by Mahant Raghubar Das was his personal move
 nafde ne kaha ki yah saaf he ki 1885 main jo suut daakhil kiya tha vah chabutare par puja ke adhikaar ke liye daakhil gaya tha
 Justice Chandrachun said that the suit of 1885 is not from Nirmohi Arena
 use ek mahant ne daakhil kiya tha
 To say that the Hindu side cannot file a case again does not sound right
 mukhya nyaayadhish ne muslim pakshakaron ke vakil shekhar nafde se poocha ki aap apni daleel kab tak puri kar lenge
 In response, Shekhar Nafde said that 2 hours more
 mukhya nyaayadhish ne kaha ki ham apana shidul nahi badalengenirdhaarit avadhi vyateet hone ke baad chif justise ne kaha ki aapaki bahes puri ho gai he
 To this, Shekhar Nafde said that i should be given 30 minutes more

 rafel par sansad main pesh kii gai niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak (CAG) kii report ko jahaan sarkaar apni jeet bataa rahi he, vahiin vipaksh ab bhi yah maanane ko taiyaar nahin he ki is saude main gadabad nahin hui he
 The CAG report says that the deal that the Modi government has done, a total of 2 from the UPA deal
 86 fisadi sasti he
 However, in this report, the CAG has also accepted many such points, which have been indicated by those who raise questions about this deal
 kuch pramukh bindu is prakaar hai-1
 Comparison of prices: First of all, let us understand that the CAG has made it clear at the beginning of its audit report on Rafale that both UPA and NDA deals cannot have a perfect price comparison
 isaki vajah yah he ki upie ke dauraan jo prastaavit sauda tha, usamen vimaanon ke bharat main utpaadan ke liye hindustan aironautics limited (echeel) ko license dene kii baat thi
 But there is nothing like this in the deal of Modi government
 sieji ne kaha he, '2007 or 2015 ke ofer kii tulana karne main kai kathinaaiyaan he, jaise 2007 vaale prastaav main bharat main 108 vimaanon ke licency utpaadan kii keemat bhi shaamil thi, jabaki 2015 ke prastaav main sirf fliave vimaan kii baat kii gai he
 Hence the comparison can be made for the price of only 18 flyaway aircraft
 2
 According to the report, when the UPA government's deal came to a standstill, after the formation of the new government, the Eurocopter company EADS offered to offer the aircraft at a price 20% lower than Rafael
 Had
 lekin raksha mantralay ne kuch vajah bataakar uskaa yah ofer sweekaar nahin kiya
 3
 57 fisadi kam keemat ke ofer ko bataaya avyaavhaarikbharat kii taraf se nigoshiation karne vaali team ne discount kii ummid, market study or daso aviation kii salanaa report main bataai gai bikri keemat ke aadhaar par jo benchmark keemat tay kii thi vah francisi company ke shuruaati prastaav se kareeb 57 fisadi kam tha
 However, the CAG has also described this price as impractical
 4
 Neither the Bank Guarantee nor the Sovereign Guarantee report stated that it was decided earlier that the French company would give a bank guarantee of 15 per cent on the deal
 kanoon evam nyaay mantralay ne yah suzav diya tha ki saude par france taraf se bank or sovrain guarantee lee jaae
 But neither the company agreed to give bank guarantee on this nor any sovereign guarantee was given from France
 isaki jagah ek 'letters of comfort' pradaan kiya gaya
 5
 bank guarantee na milane se daso ko bachatareport main kaha gaya he ki bank ganrti or bank charge na dene kii vajah se jo paisa vendor yani daso kaa batch rahaa he vah raksha mantralay ko milanaa chahie
 The Ministry of Defense accepted cng's estimate of how much the company is saving on this item
 par mantralay ne kaha ki nae prastaav main yah lagu nahin he
 But the CAG says that it is a saving for Dassault Aviation compared to 2007
 6
 Doubt on timely supply According to the CAG report, the Indian negotiation team had suspected that the supply of the aircraft would be done within a fixed period of 71 months
 team ne kaha tha ki daso har saal 11 vimaan kaa utpaadan karti he or backlog ko dekhte hue aisa lagata he ki yahi gati rahi to aapurti main saat saal se zyada samay lag jayega
 On this, the Ministry of Defense said that the DASO projects are running on time and it is being closely monitored by an inter-governmental bilateral team

 Amitabh has also shared memories of his first meeting with Suniv Gavaskar in London

 People of Dalit community staged a massive protest in Delhi on Wednesday against the demolition of Sant Guru Ravidas temple in Tughlakabad, Delhi
 jiske baad nile gamachon, nile jhandon or nile binar-poster lekar hajaaron kii sankhya main log dilli ke ramlila maidan main pahunche or ravidaas mandir tode jane kaa virodh karne lage
 With sticks in their hands, these people were shouting slogans of Jai Bhima and Jai Guru Ravidas
 vahiin soshal media par bhi is maamle ko lekar bavaal machaa hua he
 Let's know about Saint Guru Ravidas
 sant guru ravidaas 15veen sadi ke ek mahaan samaaj sudhaarak the
 He taught social welfare by rising above discrimination
 sant guru ravidaas ke janm se judi zyada jaankaree nahin he lekin kuch saakshyon or tathyon ke aadhaar par mahaan sant guru ravidaas kaa janm san 1377 ke aasapaas mana jaataa he
 According to Hindu Dharma month, Saint Guru Ravidas was born on the full moon day of the month of Magha
 unhen sant raidas ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Guru Ravidas was born in the village of Gobardhanpur in Varanasi city of Uttar Pradesh
 unke pita santokhdas ji juute banane kaa kaam karte the
 At the same time, Raidas started living under the influence of sage saints
 iske chalate unamem bhakthi kii bhaavana bachapan se hi bhar gai thi
 But Ravidas ji believed in his work with devotion
 yahi vajah thi ki wo pita se mila juute banane kaa kaam bhi lagan se karne lage
 Whenever someone needed help, Ravidas used to donate shoes to people without taking any money
 sant ravidaas kii khaasiyat ye thi ki vah bahut dayaalu the
 He loved to help others
 kahin sadhu-sant mil jaaen to ve unki seva karne se peeche nahin hatate the
 He raised his voice against the evils prevailing in the society
 chuaachhut aadi kaa unhone virodh kiya or puure jivan in kuritiyon ke khilaaf hi kaam karte rahe
 Without voicing criticism, it is said about him that Sant Ravidas used to raise voice against the evils of the society
 unhone madhyakaal main brahmanwad ko chunauti di thi
 From his writings, he gave the idea to the society that no person is superior on the basis of birth
 unki panktiyaan, 'raidas babhan mat puujie jo hove gun hin, puujie charan chandaal ke jo ho gun parveen' aaj bhi logon ko sikhaa rahi hai
 The theory of egalitarian theory, which he tried to explain in that era, is seen even today, his voice is being raised on this concept
 die karm ke siddhantaraidas ne sidhe-sidhe likhaa ki 'raidas janm ke kaarne hot na koi neech, nar kun neech kar daari he, oche karam kii neech' yani koi bhi vyakti sirf apane karm se neech hota he
 The person who does wrong things is despicable
 koi bhi vyakti janm ke hisaab se kabhi neech nahin hota
 Apart from this, he also tried to hurt casteism
 uttar pradesh ke purv diarector general of police (dijipi) brijlaal buudhvaar ko bhartiya janata party (bijepi) main shaamil ho gaye hai

 He has done a fantastic job as an IPS, he wants to work under the leadership of Narendra Modi
 'brijlaal 1977 batch ke adhikari hai or pichley saal november main hi ritair hue hai
 On 15 March 2012, when Akhilesh Yadav became the Chief Minister, he was removed from the post of DGP
 brijlaal ko bispi supremeo mayawati kaa kareebi mana jaataa tha

 There was a lot of trouble due to the lack of online registration and deposit arrangements in the college
 students or abhibhavak din bhar yun hi pareshaan rahe
 At the same time, another student says that this year, one of the reasons for the problem in the admission process is DUTA, in fact, DUTA is bycoting admission to demand to roll back the API
 vishvavidhyalay prashasan kii najar se puraa maamla
 
 
 On this whole matter, Rajendra Prasad, the principal of Ramjas College, argues that since the first day, more students came to the portal
 isaki vajah se sarwar thodi der ke liye down ho gaya
 However, the situation was later rectified
 dean- student welfare, je em khurana kehete hai keadmishnaka pehla din hone kii vajah se students pareshaan the
 There was a panic in him that despite being named in the cut-off, the seat could not be removed due to these problems
 isi vajah se ve baari sankhya main site par pahunch gaye or sarwar down ho gaya

 Nearly eight years after ending 34 years of Left Front rule in Bengal, now Mamata is getting a new and tough political challenge from BJP in Bengal
 2014 ke aam chunaav main bengal se maatr 16
 The BJP, which won two seats with 8 percent votes, has increased its vote share and its seats significantly this time
 2019 main 40 fisad voton ke saath bhaajapa ne 18 loksabhaa siten jeet leen
 It all started in 2015 when BJP national president Amit Shah sent 45-year-old joint general secretary (organization) Shiv Prakash, who did not even know Bengali, to Bengal
 unhen 'mishan bengal' ko anjaam dene kii ruparekha taiyaar karne kii jimmedaari di gai thi
 Prakash worked with Shah in Uttar Pradesh during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 madhya pradesh ke do netaaon—kailash vijayawargeey or arvind menon ko bhi bengal bheja gaya
 By that time, Mamata was happily sitting in power with a huge vote share of 44 per cent
 haalanki unki party ke netaaon par jabaran vasuuli or logon ke loktantric adhikaron ke hanan ke aarope lag rahe the
 TMC won the 2016 assembly election by a two-thirds majority despite chit fund schemes like Sarada and Rose Valley facing corruption charges and seeing its leaders carrying cash on camera in a sting operation
 rajya ke ek bhaajapa netaa kehete hai, ''sattadhari party ke khilaaf sthiti visphotak thi
 But we could not use it because no one had the courage to hoist the BJP flag at his home in rural Bengal
 ''network bananabhajapa ne cader aadhaarit majboot neenv ke nirmaan se apane mishan kaa aagaaj kiya
 Instead of a bulky structure at the top, its workers reached out to people in a decentralized manner
 har jile ko 20 khandon main baanta gaya or prayek khand ko mandal kaha gaya
 Each mandal with 60 booths had around 40,000-50,000 voters
 har mandal main 12 se 36 sadasyon kii samiti karyrat thi
 Those working under the mandal were called Shakti chiefs with the specific goal of increasing the party's presence in five to six booths
 unke neeche booth paalak the jinhen do booth yani 2,000 matadaataaon ko lakshya karne kii jimmedaari di gai thi
 The party gave the Panna chiefs the responsibility to interact with 30-50 voters in each region, befriend them and solve their problems
 party kaaryakartaaon ko sanghathanaatmak ikaayiyon kaa padaadhikari banaaya gaya taaki unhen yah ehsaas dilaayaa ja sake ki mishan bengal unka apana mishan he
 There were 30-40 leaders in each district, but the Jogi monastery was not allowed to go to the desolate because each was assigned a specific task and no matter who was a functionary or officer of any level, all Shah's soldiers were in Bengal
 party ne dedh saal ke bheetar mandal kii sankhya 484 se badhaakar 1,250 or shakti kendron ko shunya se badhaakar 12,404 kiya
 Appointed more than 10,000 power chiefs and booth committees were increased from zero to 58,000
 party ne 294 vidhansabha kshetron main se prayek ke liye 300 vistaarak bhi niyukt kiye
 These were full-time workers, who were paid 15,000
 masik bhatta, rahane ke liye jagah or gaanvon tak pahunchane ke liye ek bike bhi di gai
 The job of the expander was to camp in a constituency, oversee organizational work and send weekly reports to the party headquarters
 party ne shikshakon, adhivaktaaon, sangeet mandalon or maatuon (bangladeshi dalit jo seemaa paar kar pashchim bengal chale aae hai) ke alag-alag prakoshth bhi banaae
 The use of new media reached the party's 15,000-member whatsapp group of 1
5 million voters

 There was also discontent among the party workers
 udhaaharan ke liye, hughali se tikat se vanchit party ke rajya upaadhyaksh raajakmal pathak ne apane pad se istipha de diya
 He was immediately sent to North Bengal, holding the responsibility of organizing Modi's rally in Siliguri and ensuring the party's victory in the region
 ummidavaaron ko kshetra ke matadaataaon kii saamaajik sanrachana ko dhyaan main rakhte hue bhi chunaa gaya tha
 "we got barely a fortnight to campaign for the first two phases of elections in areas like North Bengal," says BJP leader from Cooch Behar, Diptiman Sengupta

 ÓÓ malda jile main majboot aadhaar rakhane vaale khagen murmu jaise vam ke purv vidhayak ko bhi party main shaamil hone ke turant baad chunaav ladgaye kii anumati di gai
 The BJP tried to mobilize the majority, accusing Mamata of minority appeasement
 presidency college main saamaajik vigyaan ke purv professor prashanth re kehete hai, ''dharmik dhruvikaran bhaajapa kaa turup kaa patta tha or mamata us chakravyuuh main funs gayi
 He tried to woo both Hindus and Muslims by quoting chants and Quranic verses from the same platform
 ''bhaajapa ne yah sandesh dene ke liye do muslim ummidavaaron ko maidan main utaara ki vah sampradayik nahin he
 Sengupta says, "it was important to remove Muslim candidates to remove the communal tag and make the party acceptable among the Left voters
" '' alpsankhyak bahul jile malda main 48 pratishat hinduon ne bhaajapa ko vot diya or ek seat malda (uttar) par bhaajapa ne jeet hasil kii to duusari seat malda (dakshin) 8,000 voton se haar gai
 The Left, the right-wing orphanage, left no stone unturned to dent the Left's vote share
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main left ko 29
 7 percent and 33 in the 2016 assembly elections
 5 fisad vot mili the
 The transfer of votes of the Left can increase bjp's vote share and this was proved in the 2016 Cooch Behar Lok Sabha by-election, where 27 percent of the votes of the Forward Bloc were directly transferred to the BJP, leaving the BJP in fourth place

 jadavapur vishvavidhyalay ke purv professor mohit re kehete hai, ''tiemasi ke khilaaf ladaai main vamapanthiyon kaa samarthan hasil karnaa aasaan tha kyonki vah vamapanthiyon kii swaabhaavik dushman thi or ise satta or rajya prashasan ke haathon sabase adhik nuksaan uthaanaa padaa tha
 The BJP came out openly in support of Left activists who were allegedly facing false cases or were afraid of returning to their villages after the TMC came to power
 ''tiemasi par kathith jhuthe maamalon main bhaajapa netaaon ko fansaane ke bhi aarope lagaae gaye the; prakaash aktubar 2018 main ek balaatkaar ke maamle main fanse jiske liye unhen agrim jamaanat leni padi thi

 '' jalpaigudi kii chauraaband raily main, modi ne mamata kii bhedbhaavpurn raajnneeti ke shikaar ke rup main sipiem-shasit silligudi nagar nigam kaa ullekh kiya
 This was to send a message to the Left supporters that the PM is aware that Mamata is not allocating funds to her governed civic bodies simply because the opposition is dominated by those bodies
 sanyog se, modi kii jabardast jeet ke ek din baad, lagbhag 10 sipiem party karyaalay vamapanthiyon ko saunp die gaye or kuchbihar, birbhum, 24 uttar pargana or hughali jilon main laal jhanda phir se fahraaya gaya
 The Left was no longer a threat to the BJP
 left kaa vot share 2014 main 29 fisad se ghatakar 2019 main 7 fisad ho gaya
 However, former CPM MP Mohammad Salim says, "the transfer of left votes is a story created by the media and the RSS
" hamaare vot share main giravat or bhaajapa ke vot share main vruddhi ko ek saamaanya ankaganit ke formule se jodakar nahin dekha janaa chahie
 Political analysts say the BJP did not allow the Congress and the Left parties to form a credible, secular Third Front, which could have clouded the saffron party's prospects
 raajnneeti vigyaan ke professor vishwanath chakravarti kehete hai, ''bengal main, muqabla tiemasi or bhaajapa ke bich tha
 And the BJP ensured that there was no division of anti-incumbency votes

 is rajya main koi pahchaan na rakhane vaali bhaajapa vahaan sattarudh congress ko haraane ke liye nesanalist pipuls party (enpipi, jo centre or meghalaya main uski sahyogi he) par daanv chal rahi he

 The leader of Sangma's party NPP and Sangma's son Konrad has refused to join the BJP
 conrad kaa kahana he ki bhaajapa ke saath gathbandhan karne se enpipi ke logon ko kam tikat milenge
 At the same time, he is also expected to suffer loss in the Christian majority state due to the alliance
 sattadhari congress ke aath vidhayakon ko todgaye main safal hone ke baad enpipi ko apni kamyaabi kaa puraa bharosa he
 Chief Minister Mukul Sangma is also confident of his victory despite allegations of corruption
 ve us rajya main ''sthirataa laane vaali congress'' kii jeet par bharosa kar rahe hai jo baar-baar satta parivartan ke liye kukhyat rahaa he
 Experts, on the other hand, believe that the United Democratic Party (UDP), the largest opposition party in Meghalaya and some independents, can emerge as real 'kingmakers'
 nagaland main naga pipuls front (enpief) ne bhaajapa ke saath gathbandhan khatm kar diya he
 Although BJP leaders are not open to much about this 'divorce', it is being told that the saffron party is planning to tie up with the newly fledged National Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP)
 yahaan party ke chunaav prabharee kendriya grih rajyamantri kiran rigiju rajya main pehle hi 'endie sarkaar banane' kii bhavishyavaanee kar rahe hai
 The leader of the NDPP is Neiphiu Rio, who has been the Chief Minister as the leader of the NPF
 vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki enpief kaa saath chhodie se bhaajapa ko phayda ho saktaa he
 NPF President Shurojeli Legistu alleges that leaders of the saffron party are trying to disband their mlas so that the story of Arunachal can be repeated in Nagaland too
 bhaajapa ko rio ke saath jane main zyada phayda najar aa rahaa he kyonki rajya main 8 pratishat se zyada jansankhya vaale angaami nagaaon main rio kii majboot pakad he
 The Congress has been out of power here for the last 15 years and this time too it is not expecting any big success

 Trusting Theri
 tripura main haalanki 1993 se vam morcha satta par kabiz he, par ab yahaan bhaajapa satta hasil karne kii ummid kar rahi he
 Hemant Vishwa Sarma, who played a key role in winning the saffron party in Assam and Manipur, is the election in-charge here
 yahaan tak ki mukhyamantri maanik sarkaar bhi sweekaar karte hai ki bhaajapa yahaan chunauti dene vaali mukhya party he
 And the reason is also there
 2015 se vidhansabha upachunaavon main bhaajapa number do rahi he
 The BJP is actively engaged in wooing the tribals with a population of 32 per cent in Tripura
 isane indigenus pipuls front of tripura (ipift) ke saath gathbandhan kar liya he
 The IPFT has a good hold on 20 tribal seats (reserved) in the 60-member assembly
 isane may 2015 main tripura tribal ariaj autonamas distric council kii sabhi 28 siten jeet lee thim lekin vam morcha ko 10 pratishat voton kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa tha (64 pratishat se ghatakar 54 pratishat)
 The BJP is excited because of the mlas leaving the party and accompanying it
 party chhodie vaale vidhayakon main trinmul congress ke chah or ipift ke paanch netaa (gathbandhan kii ghoshnaa se pehle) shaamil hai
 Sarma is not blooming
 ve kehete hai, ''isamen koi shaq nahin ki log sarkaar ke khilaaf vot dekar use baahar kaa rasta dikhaa denge
 "but an alliance with the IPFT seeking a separate 'tameparaland' for the natives may become a problem for him
" bhagava party yah kabhi nahin chaahegi ki use ek aisi party ke rup main dekha jaae jo rajya kii adhisankhya bengali aabaadi ko alag-thalag karne kii maang kaa samarthan karti ho
 Though the alliance threatens to offend the Bengali public, the proposed Citizenship (amendment) Bill, 2016 is creating fear among the state's original inhabitants, as tribal organizations claim that the bill would give Hindus coming from Bangladesh citizenship

 At the same time, the Supreme Court has allowed children older than 12 years to join it

 co / tticznrtgl maharashtra main sarkaar gathan ke kya he vikalprashtrapati shashan lagegaa yaa phir banegi sarkaarmaharashtra kii satta par koun hoga kabiz or kiski banegi sarkaar, yah tasviir abhi tak saaf nahin ho saki he
 Even after the invitation of Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, the BJP has backed down from forming the government, the Shiv Sena could not submit a majority support letter on the deadline
 aise main sarkaar gathan ke liye governor ne ensipi ko nyotaa diya he, jinhen shaam 8 baje tak samarthan patr ke saath sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karnaa hoga
 After the BJP and Shiv Sena, if NCP also fails in the exam to collect majority data, then the discussion of imposing Maharashtra President's rule will be raised
 aise main samvidhan visheshgy or rajyasabha sadsy subhash kashyap ke lihaaj se rajyapal ke saamne maharashtra main raashtrapati shashan lagane ke saath-saath kai or vikalp bhi maujuud hai
 Subhash Kashyap says Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who has resigned as Chief Minister, may order Devendra Fadnavis to serve as acting Chief Minister until a new Chief Minister is found in Kimhara
 unhone kaha ki samvidhan ke tahat yah jaruri nahin he ki mukhyamantri kaa kaarykaal vidhansabha ke saath hi khatm ho jaae, kyonki nai vidhansabha chunakar aa gai he
 Although Devendra Fadnavis has refused to form the government
 subhash kashyap kehete hai ki maharashtra main doosraa vikalp yah he ki rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari vidhansabha chunaav nateezon main sabase zyada siten jeetne vaali party ke kisi netaa ko mukhyamantri bana sakate hai
 In this context, the new Chief Minister of BJP can be formed, because Maharashtra has elected its maximum 105 mlas
 haalanki aise main siem banane ke baad bijepi ko vidhansabha main bahumat sabit karnaa hoga
 Let me tell you that in 2014 the BJP formed a government in Maharashtra like this and walked out of the assembly during the NCP floor test
 is tarah sebijapi ne alpamat kii sarkarbana lee thi
 At present, the political situation this time, it is difficult for the BJP to collect majority data
 aise main bijepi is tarah kaa jokhim bharaa kadam nahin uthaaegi
 Apart from this, Bhagat Singh Koshiyari can allow his leader to be elected through elections from the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly as a third option for state formation
 iske liye wo supreme court ke ek faisle ke aadhaar bana sakate he
 In 1998, the Supreme Court ordered the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly to do so
 in saare vikalpon ke baavjood agar maharashtra main koi sarkaar gathan nahin ho paata he to rajyapal ke paas raashtrapati lagane kii sifarish karne ke alaava koi rasta nahin bachegaa
 The congress-ncp has refrained from joining the Shiv Sena after the BJP pulled out
 aise main raashtrapati shashan lagane kii hi prabal sambhaavna dikh rahi he
 Andhra Pradesh today took a historic step to connect its two major rivers, Godavari and Krishna
