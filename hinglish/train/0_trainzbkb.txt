 johari naaraaz hai ki sarkaar ne do lakh se zyada kaa sona-chaandi kareedne ke liye pan number zaruri bana diya he
 He argues that there are many people who do not have PAN - they are not able to buy gold and silver
 khaskar enarai, gharelu mahilaayein, graamy ilaake ke log or chote-chote kaarobaar main mazaduri kar paisa kamaanevaale log
 Until last year, PAN was required only on purchases above five lakh
 phir ise ek lakh kar diya gaya
 But when jewelers created a ruckus about it, this limit was raised to two lakhs
 lekin kaarobaari ab bhi naakhush hai
 He says his business has fallen by 25 per cent in the last two months
 mahatvapurn baat ye he ki pichley kareeb do teen saalon se sone kaa bazaar manda tha
 Investing in gold did not seem to be a profitable deal
 isaliye log zaruri na ho to sona kharidne se parhez rakh rahe the
 But in the last fifteen days the market has returned sharply, gold has jumped from 26,000 per 10 grams to Rs 28,500
 lekin is niyam kii vajah se log dur hai
 The comments vaise ye niyam lagu karne ke peeche sarkaar kii mansha kaale dhan par lagaam lagane kii thi
 But according to traders, instead of banning black money, it is encouraging black business
 pehle aam taur par chote-chote johriyon se sona le liya jaataa tha
 No guarantee like Hallmark was required
 zyaadaatar pakkaa bill bhi nahin banataa tha or sarkaar ko tex bhi nahin jaataa tha
 But things were also going well in this area in the past years
 hollmark kii maang hone lagi thi
 Due to which, the gold had started reaching the people and jewelers started paying tax on the profits made from this gold
 johriyon kaa kahana he ki agar isi tarah chalata rahaa to phir se kaale kaarobaar kaa daur haaavee ho jaayegaa
 People will start selling without bills and false hallmarks
 johariyon ke sangh ne ye bhi kaha he ki sarkaar ne agar unki baat nahin maani to wo andolan tej karenge

 johariyon ke sangh ne ye bhi kaha he ki sarkaar ne agar unki baat nahin maani to wo andolan tej karenge
 The important thing is that for the last about two to three years, the gold market was stagnant
 sone main nivesh phaayde kaa sauda nahin lag rahaa tha
 So people were abstaining from buying gold if it was not necessary
 lekin pichley pandrah din main bazaar main tezi lauti he, sona 26,000 prati 10 gram se uchhal kar 28,500 rupee tak pahunch gaya he
 But people are away because of this rule
 tippaniyan However, the government's intention behind implementing this rule was to curb black money
 lekin kaarobaariyon ke mutabik isse kaale paise par roak lagane kii jagah kaale kaarobaar ko badhaava mil rahaa he
 Earlier gold was usually taken from small jewelers
 hollmark jaisi kisi guarantee kii zarurat nahin rahati thi
 Most of the bills were not even made and the government was not taxed
 lekin beete varshon main is kshetra main bhi chizein thik ho rahi thi
 Hallmark was in demand
 jisaki vajah se logon tak khara sona pahunchane laga tha or is sone se hote munaafe par johari tex bhi jamaa karwaane lage the
 Jewelers say that if this trend continues, then the black business era will prevail
 log bina bill ke or jhootha hollmark lagaakar ke bechney lagenge
 The association of jewelers has also said that if the government does not listen to them, they will intensify the movement
 vaise ye niyam lagu karne ke peeche sarkaar kii mansha kaale dhan par lagaam lagane kii thi
 But according to traders, instead of banning black money, it is encouraging black business

 papa ne 9 saal kii umr main thamaya tha ballaviraat kohli kaa janm ek madhyamvargeey parivaar main 5 navbanr 1988 ko dilli main hua
 Virat studied at the Vishal Bharti Public School and Savior Convent School in Delhi
 bachapan se hi cricket ke prati unki deewangi dekhne laayak thi
 And due to this, his father Prem Kohli started getting cricket training to Virat at the age of 9
 viraat ke pita unhen scooter par baitaakar pehali baar westedilli cricket academylekar gaye the

 During his school days, Virat was not only strong in cricket, but was also intelligent in studies

 iske liye unhone khub pasinaa bahaya or jamkar mehnat kii
 He turned his attention to cricket after 12th

 His grandfather had come to Katni at the time of Partition

 In 1961, Virat's father Prem Kohli moved to Delhi with the family
 isi vajah se viraat ko dilli kaa mana jaataa he

 kohli ne 34 gendon par 18 ran banaae
 Indeed, Kohli, the world's most dangerous batsman, scored a century in his first matches of the 2011 and 2015 World Cups
 agar wo south africa ke khilaaf match main bhi shatak jad dete to unke naam teen world cap ke pehle match main shatak lagane kaa record ban jaataa
 He would become the first player to do so
 bataa den ki kohli ne 2011 main mirpur main bangladesh ke khilaaf khele gaye team india ke pehle mukaable main shatak jadaa tha
 After this, he also scored a century (107 runs) in Team India's first match played against Pakistan in Adelaide in the 2015 World Cup

 samaan naagarik samhita lagu karne par vidhi ayog dwaara rajyon se puche gaye 16 sutri sawaalon ko bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne khaarij kar diya he
 Nitish has written a letter to the Law Commission on this issue and has demanded that the sensitive issue like the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code be discussed first from the road to the Parliament session
 nitish kumaar ke likhe patr kii 13 mukhya baaten:1
 The 16-point questions are formulated in such a way that the person answering is under pressure to answer on one side
 2
 The person answering these 16-point questions has no freedom to give his or her own independent answer
 3
 It is not possible for the state of Bihar to be able to answer these questions
 4
 The framers of the Constitution had also talked about the Uniform Civil Code, but through the consent of other religions, especially through consent
 5
 According to media reports, the Muslim community has completely rejected the Uniform Civil Code
 6
 No other religion is raising its voice with the same civil code
 7
 To enforce a uniform civil code, all laws of other religions have to be rejected
 8
 The situation in the country is not yet such that the Uniform Civil Code is implemented
 9
 The details of the proposed Uniform Civil Code have not yet been shared with all the parties
 10
 Before implementing the Uniform Civil Code, it should be discussed in Parliament, in state legislatures and with civil society people
 11
 The government should not be hasty in implementing the Uniform Civil Code
 12
 It is prudent to allow people of all religions to discuss this issue so that they can present their side after that
 13
 If the common civil code is not implemented with the consent of the people of all religions, then there may be further communal discord in the society

 PM Modi has taught a good lesson to the parties that formed the government from Jharkhand under the pretext of Maharashtra on the pretext of Karnataka
 The results of the Karnataka Assembly by-election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday attacked 'backdoor-forming parties' from Jharkhand
 piem modi ne naam liye bagaiyr maharashtra kii shivasena-congress-ensipi kii sarkaar par ishaaron-ishaaron main nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that the people of Karnataka taught a good lesson to the parties that formed the government through the back door
 pradhanmantri modi ne kaha ki karnataka ke logon ne sunishchit kar diya he ki congress yaa jedies vahaan ke logon ke saath vishwasghaat nahin kar paaenge
 The PM said that this is a message to all the states of the country that if someone goes against the mandate, cheats the people, then the public will punish him as soon as he gets the first opportunity
 unhone kaha ki karnataka ke logon ne congress or uske saathiyon kii sarkaar ke dauraan bhrashtachar or vikaas ke saath laaparvaahee dekhi thi
 That is why they have voted for the BJP
 jodtod kii raajnneeti karne waalon ko sabakpiem ne sthirataa or vikaas ke liye bijepi par ek baar phir vishwaas jataane ke liye karnataka kii janata kaa aabhaar vyakt kiya
 Modi said that the people had given mandate to BJP to form government in the elections, but Congress did not allow BJP to form government by playing behind the scenes
 aaj janata ne unhen sajaa di he, zyaadaatar siton par bijepi jeet hasil kar rahi he
 The people of Karnataka have been demolished by the people of Karnataka democratically
 70 saal main jin siton par nahin jite vahaan bhi camel khilapradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki karnataka ke upachunaav ke nateezon se yah tay hone vaala tha ki bijepi kii sarkaar jaaegi yaa rahegi
 The public gave majority to the BJP to form the government
 lekin congress vaale pichley daravaaje se chadh baithe the
 The public has punished him fiercely
 unhone kaha ki jin 15 siton par upachunaav hue hai, inamen se kai siten aisi rahi hai jahaan 70 saal main bijepi kabhi jiti hi nahin thi
 The public got so angry against the traitors that even where we did not win, they gave us victory even there
 ek do siten aisi hai, jahaan bijepi ke saamaanya kaaryakartaaon ne congress or jedies ko bade bade diggaj ko dhul chataa diya
 This statement of PM has been seen in the context of Maharashtra
 maharashtra main congress-shivasena-ncp sarkaarbta den ki maharashtra membijapi or shivasena ne milakar vidhansabhachunaav ladaa tha or donon ke spasht bahumat mila tha
 But the Shiv Sena was adamant about the chief minister's chair
 iske chalate shivasena ne bijepi se naata todakar congress or ensipi se haath milakar sarkaar bana liya
 In such a situation, the statement of PM Modi's Karnataka result is being seen as a political message for Maharashtra

 On July 24, the Delhi High Court overturned its own order on Tuesday because the court was told by the assembly committees that video recordings of the meetings between Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash and assembly committees could not be given to the court
 kyonki yah court ke kshetradhikaar main nahin aata
 Therefore, the court should amend its old order of July 24, in which orders were given to videography the meeting and hand it over to the court
 26 or 27 july ko in cametiyon ke saamne anshu prakaash pesh ho chuke hai
 However, the court expressed its displeasure that at first the assembly committees had passed their arbitrary orders from the court and now instead of following the instructions of the court, that jurisdiction is being talked about
 court is baat se bhi naaraaz tha ki vidhansabha samitiyon kii taraf se pesh hone vaale vakil har taarikh par badal jate hai
 However, the court will now hear on 18 September whether the court has the jurisdiction to submit the video of the meetings between the assembly committees and Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash

 Which Anshu Prakash challenged in the Delhi High Court
 court ne donon pakshon ko sunne ke baad anshu prakaash ko vidhansabha samitiyon kii meeting main jane kaa nirdesh diya tha
 But at the same time orders were also given to videography these meetings and hand over the videos to the court

 US President Donald Trump tried hard to intimidate, intimidate and intimidate North Korean Supreme Leader Marshall Kim Jong
 magar jab koi tarika kaam nahin aayaa to korian peninsula main khud america raashtrapati trump aa gaye
 He is busy preparing for Chakravyuh for Kim Jong by wandering in five countries of Asia
 lekin duniya ko dar is baat kaa he ki bhale kim jong un ko is chakravyuuh se baahar nikalne kaa rasta na pataa ho lekin apane style main wo koi missile yaa parmaanu bam ke pareekshan ke dhamaake se use tod saktaa he
 Troubled by Kim, Trump Morschelkim Jong has forced the president of not only the entire world but also the most powerful country in the world to protest and mobilize support for North Korea
 north korea ke aage america raashtrapati is kadar pareshaan nazar aa rahe hai ki 11 dinon ke asian daure par nikal pade hai
 Donald Trump's long Asian tour is in the news because no American president has done so in the last 25 years
 tabaahi kaa final plansb sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya ye kim kii tabaahi kaa final plan he
 Will the US teach North Korea a lesson
 kya trump ne kim ke safaaye ke liye qamar kas lee he
 What is the end of Tanshah Kim Jong if the battle is over? kya sach main kim kii nakebandi kii ulti ginati shuru ho chuki he
 The end of Kim's call: Countries standing in support of the US are hoping that Trump's Asian tour is heralding the end of North Korea's Marshal Kim Jong
 kyonki donald trump kaa kahana he ki wo asia ke 5 deshon kii yatra main kim jong un par nakel kasne kii sambhaavnaaen talashne aae hai
 Through this tour, they are trying to surround North Korea
 america propeganda kaa asarlekin ye tasviir kaa sirf ek pahalu he
 The other aspect is that the world either does not want to see or the American propaganda has closed its eyes
 jabaki haqikat to ye he ki kim jong un or yuan main unke netaa pehle hi kah chuke hai ki north korea ke parmaanu hathiyaar kisi kii tabaahi ke liye nahin balki apni suraksha ke liye he
 But if someone poses a threat to the security of their country, they can also use it
 trump kaa daura uksaane walaaise main tanaav ke is maahaul main america raashtrapati donald trump kaa ye daura na sirf north korea ko uksaane vaala he
 Rather, it is not surprising that he could not do the next nuclear or missile test to answer the US
 aapako bataa den ki 5 november se america raashtrapati donald trump 11 dinon tak asia main rahenge
 The purpose of his diplomatic tour is to put pressure on Marshal Kim Jong
 china banegaa raah main rodajapan, dakshin korea, china, vietnam or philippines
 This visit of Trump is believed to be a response to the threat of North Korea, which he is constantly giving to America
 magar asia main trump kii dhak jamaane kii ye ranneeti kaise kaamyaab hogi ye aane vaala vakt hi batayega
 Because even though he is going to China in this tour, experts are assuming that China does not allow him to do so easily
 ek tir, do shikarayun bhi america kii niyat korian peninsula main shanti banaae rakhane kii he yaa is rigen main china ko chunauti dene kii he isse sab waakif he
 North Korea is actually trying to shoot two with one stone by placing a gun on Korea's shoulder
 pentagon ne shuru kiya akalnavahin duusari taraf america raksha mukhyalay pentagon ne baqayada ye akalan shuru kar diya he ki jang hui to america kii jeet ke raste kya honge
 The Pentagon has sent reports on war preparations to US lawmakers
 kyonki america sansad ne pentagon se jang kii sthiti main taiyaari par input maanga tha
 Threats from biological, chemical weapons, according to the report sent to the members of the US troops will land on the land of North Korea only when the location of the nuclear weapons will be detected
 khatra he ki uttar korea jaivik or rasaynic hathiyaar kaa istemaal kar saktaa he
 The full details of the possible steps taken by the US in the event of an nuclear attack are given in that report
 uttar korea ke paas nerve jaise khatarnaak agents banane kii kshamta he, jiskaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 The lawmakers asked for the report
 American lawmakers also sought an assessment of the Pentagon on the damage caused by the war
 pentagon ne sabase achche or sabase bure donon halaat kaa akalan kiya he
 The impact of the attack will be determined by the intensity of attack by North Korea
 pentagon kii asli chintaa dakshin korea kii rajdhani tseol kii kareeb dhai karod aabaadi he jo sabase pehle uttar korea ke hamale kii jad main honge
 Because in the event of an attack, North Korea can first target South Korea, then Japan and then Guam and finally America
 kim ne kiya tha hidrogen bam testapako yaad dilaa den ki isi saal 3 sitambar ko north korea ne ek aise hidrogen bam kaa pareekshan kiya tha, jiske bare main kaha gaya ki ye 1945 main hiroshima par giraae gaye parmaanu bam se bhi aath guna zyaada taqatvar he
 Zalzale, who had come to North Korea as well as some areas of Europe, had also confirmed this
 lekin isi ke saath jaankaron ne aagaah kar diya ki aise ek ke baad ek tabadatod pareekshanon ne newclear centre ke surang kii zamin kamazor or mitti dardri ho chuki he
 Celebs have also jumped into the campaign of Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi of the Bharatiya Janata Party, contesting from Varanasi
 is kadi main ek nayaa naam purv misses india world doctor udita tyaagi kaa bhi jud gaya he, jo varanasi main modi ke liye vot maang rahi hai
 Udita will remain in Benaras till May 12, the day of the election and will go door-to-door to appeal for votes for Modi
 darasal pichley aath march ko modi kii ‘chaay pe charchaa’ main udita kii mulaakaat narendra modi se hui thi
 After this meeting, Udita was very impressed with Modi and came to appeal to the people of Benaras to vote for Modi
 udita tyaagi ne bataaya, ‘main yahaan modi ji ke liye vot maangane ai hum
 i had a special invite in the discussion on women's empowerment on March 8 on 'chai Pe Charcha'
 tabhi unako jaanane kaa mauka mila
 Closely understood that they actually have a lot of better and better ideas for the empowerment of women
 kahin na kahin main unase prabhavit hui or banaras main unke liye 12 may tak rahakar vot maangoongi
 Udita, who won the Mrs
 India World title in 2011, is deeply impressed by the work being done by Narendra Modi for women's empowerment and youth in Gujarat
 udita ko is baat kaa puraa yakeen he ki narendra modi desh ke pradhanmantri banane ja rahe hai or jis tarah se unhone gujarat main mahilaon ke liye kaam kiya he puure desh kii mahilaon ke liye bhi karenge
 Udita further states that the position of women in the society is quite pathetic
 suraksha ko lekar dher saare mudde hai, to kahin na kahin ham saare log badi ummid ke saath gujarat model kii taraf dekhte hai ki gujarat main itani pragati hui he, mahilaayein surakshit hai
 If there is a good chance for youth, then perhaps the whole country should get these things
 to is baar hamane man banaaya he ki itane saal congress ko mauka diya to is baar modi sarkaar
 On the question of Modi becoming Prime Minister, Udita said, 'I am confident of Hundred Percent and i see a very good Women Empowerment Year in his government that a whole year will be dedicated to women
 mujhe lagata he ki hi ij kaming

 Here, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, while talking about the pride of Bihar, again targeted Narendra Modi without naming him
 unhone kaha ki bihar ko oonchaaiyon par 'bihari' hi le ja saktaa he
 He said that one cannot do external development
 bihar kaa do dinon kaa daura khatm kar gujarat lautne se pehle modi ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, "maine bam visphoton main maare gaye logon ke parivaar ke logon kaa dukhadard baantne ke liye mulaakaat kii
 " ravivaar ko patna ke gandhi maidan main modi ke pahunchane se pehle ek-ek kar aadha darjan bam visphot hue jisamen chah log maare gaye or 80 se zyada log ghayal ho gaye
 After the blasts, Modi addressed the public meeting

 unhone visphot ke baad dhary rakhane ke liye bihar ke logon kii saraahna kii
 He said, "this is a historical example of the world

 " maare gaye do logon ke supaul or gopalganj jile main sthit gaanvon kaa daura nahin kar paane ke liye modi ne apni laachaari jaahir kii or kaha ki ve bhavishya main un pariwaron ke saath milane jarur jaaenge

 abhootpurv suraksha main atithi grih ko kile main tabdeel kar diya gaya tha
 a district police officer said, "due to inclement weather on Saturday morning, Modi's meeting with the family of the deceased in Gaurichak got delayed
 hawaondde ke adhikariyon ne kam drishyata kii vajah se helicopter kii udaan ko lekar satark kiya tha
 Modi first visited Gaurichak after the weather recovered

 In fact, a petition has been filed in the High Court that the vehicles used for the people of the President, vice-president and people holding many constitutional posts have not been registered under the Motor Vehicle Act
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki bina registration kii aisi gaadiyaan na sirf aatankwaadiyon ke liye aasaan shikaar hai, balki agar in gadiyon se kisi kaa accident hota he to wo vyakti yaa unka parivaar insurance bhi clem nahi kar saktaa
 Apart from this, there is a wrong message among the common people that in democracy, rules are not equal for everyone
 yachika main uthaae gaye sawaalon ko lekar hycourt ne kaha ki nishchit taur par protocol or niyam hona chahie
 Its clear position should be presented before the court
 court kii yah tippanee ek gaiyr sarkari sanstha nyaybhumi kii janhit yachika par ai he, jisamen rajyachihn kii jagah par raashtrapati samet anya sanvaidhanik praadhikaron or ganmaanya logon kii kaaron par gaadi ko panjikaran sankhya ko dikhaane kii maang kii he

 bijepi ne goa ke vidhansabha chunaav main bina kisi siem ummidavaar ke chunaav maidan main utarane kaa faisla kiya ho, magar rajya ke chunaav prabharee or kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne yah kahkar suspence bana diya he ki centre se bhi koi netaa mukhyamantri banane ke liye bheja ja saktaa he
 The election committee of the party on Thursday announced the names of candidates in 29 out of 40 assembly seats in the state
 rajya ke mukhyamantri lakshmikant parsekar kaa naam is suchi main sabase pehle sthaan par he, jo mandarem vidhansabha seat se chunaav maidan main utrenge, lekin party ne unhen mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit nahin kiya he
 The comments guuruuvaar ko pehle dilli main or baad main goa main party kii do press conference main mukhyamantri pad ko lekar safataur par kuch nahin kaha gaya
 In Delhi, Health Minister and BJP Parliamentary Board Secretary JP Nadda said that the party has not decided who will be the chief ministerial candidate in Goa
 vahiin gadakari ne goa main yah kahkar suspence bana diya ki yaa to nirvaachit vidhayak apane bich se kisi ko netaa chunenge yaa koi kendriya mantri bhi mukhyamantri ke taur par bheja ja saktaa he
 In this way, the BJP has indicated to the Goa voters to keep the option of Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar open
 darasal, bijepi netritv ko lagata he ki goa main maujuuda paristhitiyon main lakshmikant parasekar kaa vyaktitv vaisaa karishmai nahin he jaisaa ki parrikar kaa he
 The party has therefore worked on this strategy so that suspense remains in the name of the CM candidate
 bijepi netaaon ne kaha he ki rajya main vidhansabha chunaav ke prachaar main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke baad sabase zyada parrikar ke chehre ko hi pramukhataa di jaaegi
 Goa has many troubles for the BJP
 ek to sarkaar virdohi asantosh kaa saamana karnaa he
 On the other hand, RSS leader Subhash Velingkar has increased the trouble by rebelling
 aam aadmi party ke maidan main utarane se muqabla trikoniya banataa dikh rahaa he
 At the same time, MGP, an ally of BJP, severed its relationship with the party just before the elections
 bijepi ko yah ahsaas he ki aaj kii taarikh main uske paas goa main parrikar se bada koi cheharaa nahin he, lekin pradhanmantri narendra modi parrikar ko raksha mantralay main hi rakhana chaahate hai kyonki unke karibiyon ke mutabik bataur raksha mantri parrikar kaa record behtareen mana ja rahaa he, lekin parrikar ke bina goa main bijepi kii naiyya paar laganaa bhi mushkil he
 In such a situation, BJP wants to stay ahead of the opponents strategically by calling Parrikar a candidate for Goa CM post

 is tarah bijepi ne rakshaamantri manohar parrikar ke vikalp ko khulaa rakhane kaa sanket goa ke matadaataaon ko diya he
 In fact, the BJP leadership feels that under present circumstances in Goa, Laxmikant Parsekar's personality is not as charismatic as Parrikar's
 party ne isiilie is ranneeti par kaam kiya he ki siem ummidavaar ko lekar naam par suspence hi bana rahe
 BJP leaders have said that Parrikar's face will be given the highest prominence after Prime Minister Narendra Modi in campaigning for assembly elections in the state
 bijepi ke liye goa main kai museebataan hai
 One is to face anti-government discontent
 duusari taraf aresas ke netaa subhash weylingkar ne baghawat kar musiibat badha di he
 With the Aam Aadmi Party entering the fray, the contest looks triangular
 vahiin bijepi kii sahyogi rahi emjeepi ne chunaav se thik pehle party se rishta tod diya
 The BJP realizes that to date it has no bigger face than Parrikar in Goa, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to keep Parrikar in the Ministry of Defense only because according to his close, Parrikar's record as Defense Minister is considered to be the best
 It is, but without Parrikar, it is also difficult for the BJP to get across Goa
 aise main parrikar ko goa siem pad ke liye ummidavaar bataa kar bijepi ranneetik taur par virodhiyon se aage rahanaa chaahati he
 Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh supported the remarks made against BJP national president Nitin Gadkari, saying that he would not remain silent if someone made a derogatory remark against him
 ek nijee samachar channel se baatcheet main digvijay ne kaha ‘‘ gadakari ochhi baaten karte hai
 If someone calls me Aurangzeb's child, i will not be silent
 ’’ unhone sawaal kiya ki, ‘‘ jab bhaajapa kamjor hoti he tabhi visphot kyon hote hai

 Referring to Chidambaram, Digvijay said, "when Home Minister p Chidambaram is determined he does not listen to anyone

 After Ram Gopal Yadav's return to the Samajwadi Party, there has been a stir once again within the party
 ramgopal kii vaapasi ke bare main puche jane par guuruuvaar ko shivpal yadav ne sirf itnaa hi kaha ki unhen mulaayam singh kaa har faisla manjuur he
 But this decision has increased Shivpal Yadav's discomfort
 party pramukh mulaayam singh yadav ne guuruuvaar ko ram gopal yadav kaa nishkasana radd karte hue elaan kar diya ki vah party ke rashtriya mahasachiv, rajyasabha main samaajawaadee party ke netaa or samaajawaadee party ke sansadeey dal ke netaa bane rahenge
 But what does his return to the Samajwadi Party mean? 1
 ramgopal yadav kii vaapasi se akhilesh yadav majboot honge
 At the same time, the difficulties of party state president Shivpal Yadav will increase
 parivaar kii is ladaai main ramgopal khullam khulla akhilesh ke saath hai or unke jane se akhilesh yadav akele pad gaye the
 Ram Gopal Yadav will now put Akhilesh's side firmly in front of Mulayam Singh so that not every decision can be taken by the wishes of Shivpal Yadav
 2
 Akhilesh Yadav and Ram Gopal will now pressurize that the young leaders close to Akhilesh Yadav like Sunil Singh Sajan, Sanjay Lather, Arvind Yadav, Udayvir Singh and Anand Bhadauria, get a quick withdrawal from their party
 3
 If the withdrawal process started, the four ministers, including Shivpal Yadav, who were sacked, could also be brought back to Akhilesh Yadav's cabinet
 ye mantri hai- shivpal yadav, omprakash singh, shaadaab fatima or naarad raay
 But there is confusion about whether Shivpal Yadav would like to join the cabinet again
 4
 The tussle will now increase in the distribution of tickets
 pehle mulaayam ke vishwaasapaatr hone kii vajah se shivpal yadav kii zyada chalati thi
 But now Ram Gopal Yadav will try to get more tickets to Akhilesh's people as a leader of parliamentary party
 party se baahar jane ke baad bhi vah lagaataar kehete rahe ki tikaton ke bantwaare main akhilesh yadav ko zyada adhikaar milanaa chahie

 In this, he will also be supported by Azam Khan
 lekin ajam khan sirf amar singh ke khilaaf he, shivpal yadav ke nahin

 unhone bataaya ki bihar ke vibhinn kshetron main pragati huyi he jo rajya ke sakal gharelu utpaada se spasht he
 Narayanasamy said that Bihar has received funds under both the components of the Backward Region Grant Fund

 Apart from this, an allocation of Rs 639 crore has been made under the district component in the current financial year

 Illegitimate property can come out with five measures
 real estate main sudhaar karencerkil rate tay karnaa band karen, stamp duty khatm karanjameen ke bazaar main do gadabadiyaan hai or inke kaaran kaala dhan paidaa hone se rokane ke liye inhen turant dur kiya janaa chahie
 The government should stop fixing the circle rate of land to earn revenue through stamp duty, as the actual market value across the country is much higher than the circle rate and the difference between them is usually paid in cash
 duusare, sarkaar stamp duty samaapt karne kii disha main kadam uthaa sakati he
 Its theft also results in black money transactions
 march main nai dilli main india today conklev main pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne stamp duty kii vajah se bhoomi bazaar main gadabadiyaan hone kii baat sweekaar kii thi
 Implement GST, Enforce Direct Taxes Code: The story of creation of black money economy in India has been going on since the era when there was punitive high tax on income like 95 percent
 haalanki sudhaaron ke baad karon kii daren ghat gai hai, lekin kar pranali abhi bhi puraane dharre kii bani hui he or kar chori ko protsaahit karti he
 The Goods and Services Tax is likely to reduce the rate of indirect taxes, eliminate the effect of many taxes and rates being overrated, and end the culture of tax forgiveness
 isse kar chukaane main badhotaree hogi
 Implementing the Direct Taxes Code will reduce corporate and income tax rates, while eliminating tax waivers
 sari partiyon se sampattiyon or dendariyon kii ghoshnaa karwaai jaaekale paise ke antim prayogon main se sabase ahm he chunaav ladane kaa kharch
 The government should work towards ending this important source of black money demand through comprehensive electoral reforms, in which the process of funding to political parties needs to be completely transparent
 saare dalon ko apni sampattiyon or dendariyon or unke stroton kii ghoshnaa kerani chahie
 Share information about tax evaders: The government must sign tax treaties — either to treat tax information exchanges or to avoid double taxation, which makes it possible to exchange information about suspected tax evaders
 haalanki adhikansh deshon dwaara in sandhiyon main gopneeyata kaa praavdhaan shaamil kiye jane kii sambhaavna he
 With this, the government will not be able to make the names of criminals public
 phir bhi vah unase dandatmak shulk vasuul sakegi
 Insist on paying taxes on black money
 There are differences among economists about the utility of a one-time pardon scheme, under which black money holders abroad or in the country can come forward and declare their wealth and pay 10-20 percent tax
 
 kuch iskaa samarthan karte hai
 Those who oppose this believe that such schemes are not generally considered to be a one-time scheme (in 1997 the voluntary income declaration scheme came out
 ) or is kaaran kam hi log aage aa kar apane paise kii ghoshnaa karte hai
 Also, the creation of black money is a continuous process
 yah ek baar hone vaali prakriya nahin he

 He said, 'you leave dynasty, i will stop saying shehzada
 'narendra modi ne patna ke gandhi maidan main ravivaar ko yojit 'hunkaar raily' main aae logon ko sabase pehle bhojpuri bhashaa main sambodhit kiya
 Describing Bihar's politics as inspirational, he said that Nalanda and Taxila are the places of knowledge in Bihar, so this is also the land of Sita of Ramayana
 mahabharat kaa karn yahaan he, to chandragupta maury kaa preranadayak raaj yaheen tha
 If Vaishali became the head of the Republic, then an emperor like Ashoka also happened on this earth
 modi ne kaha ki bihar se parivartan ke bina desh main parivartan nahin hoga
 Whenever the country needs it, Bihar has fulfilled it

 The extent to which the intoxication of power has been accrued to the relatives of public representatives can be gauged from the fact that in the nephew of Madhya Pradesh (madhya Pradesh) Chief Minister Kamal Nath (CM Kamal Nath), the administrative staff of Ujjain in the nephew's protocol Stirred full force

 According to government regulations, these relatives do not fall under any purview of the protocol, nor is there any provision of providing VIP facilities to them

 * desh ke hit main kendra or rajyon ne apni shaktiyon ko ek tex main nihit kar diya he, jisase desh main vikaas ko gati mil sakegi
 * It will not be easy to steal tax in the country after GST is implemented
 * jiesti lagu hone ke baad deshbhar main ek rajya se duusare rajya tak guds or services kaa movement bina kisi rukaawat ke kiya jayega
 * The constitution had separated the powers for taxation in the country by making a list between the center and the state
 jiesti ke jariye ab puure desh main kendra or rajya tex vasuulne kaa kaam ek saath karenge
 * Businessmen will no longer have to face any problem for tax
 unhen deshbhar main ek dar par or ek assesament officer ke saamne se guzarate hue apana tex adaa karne kii sahuuliyat hogi
 This will help ease their way of functioning

 He also announced that whoever is afraid of the country can go to Pakistan, their organization will arrange it
 unhone kaha ki yogi adityanath jab gorakhpur ke saansad the, tab unhone bhi kaha tha ki jisko hindustan main dar lagata he vah pakistan chale jaaen

 nayaa motor whical act lagu hone ke baad se vaahan kaa registration sartificket (aarasi), insurance sartificket, polution under control certificate, driving license or permit certificate tatkaal nahin dikhaane par tabadatod chaalaan karne kii khabaren aa rahi hai
 However, according to the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, if you do not immediately show the Registration Certificate (RC), Insurance Certificate, Pollution Under Control Certificate, Driving License (DL) and Permit Certificate on demand to the Traffic Police, it is not a crime
 supreme court ke senior edwocket vinay kumaar garg or edwocket rohit shrivastav ne bataaya ki central motor whical rules ke niyam 139 main praavdhaan kiya gaya he ki vaahan chaalak ko dastavejon ko pesh karne ke liye 15 din kaa samay diya jayega
 The traffic police cannot cut his challan immediately
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki agar chaalak 15 din ke andar in dastavejon ko dikhaane kaa daawa karata he, to trephic police yaa artio adhikari vaahan kaa chaalaan nahin kaatenge
 After this, the driver has to show these documents to the traffic police or officer concerned within 15 days
 edwocket shrivastav ne yah bhi bataaya ki motor whical act 2019 kii dhara 158 ke tahat accident hone yaa kisi vishesh maamalon main in dastavejon ko dikhaane kaa samay 7 din kaa hota he
 Apart from this, Law Professor Dr Rajesh Dubey, a traffic law expert, says that if the traffic police deducts the challan for not showing the RC, DL, Insurance Certificate, Pollution Under Control Certificate, Driving License and Permit Certificate, then the driver has it in the court There is an option to dismiss
 senior edwocket garg kaa kahana he ki agar trephic police gaiyr kanoonee tareeke chaalaan katati he, to iskaa matlab yah katai nahin hota he ki chaalak ko chaalaan bharna hi padegaa
 Traffic police challans are not a court order
 isko court main chunauti di ja sakati he
 If the court feels that the driver has all the documents and is not given 15 days to present these documents, he can waive the fine
 edwocket rohit shrivastav ne bataaya ki chaalaan main ek vitaness ke sin hona bhi jaruri he
 The traffic police has to present the witness during the summit trial in the court
 agar police vitaness pesh nahin kar paati he, to court chaalaan maaf kar sakati he
 He said that in most cases the police is unable to present the witness and the driver gets the benefit

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) With victories in Cuttack and Visakhapatnam, the Indian cricket team has taken a 2–0 lead in the five-match ODI series with the West Indies
 teesraa muqabla motera ke sardaar patel stadium main somvaar ko khelaa jayega or bhartiya team is match ko jitkar shrunkhlaa apane naam karnaa chaahegi
 The Indian team won after much struggle in Cuttack, but thanks to Virat Kohli's brilliant century in Visakhapatnam and the unbeaten half-century innings of Rohit Sharma, he won unilaterally by five wickets
 rohit ne katak main ardhashatak lagaaya tha or bharat kii jeet ke nayak bane the
 The bowlers had performed admirably in Cuttack, but the batsmen looked disappointed
 duusare match main gendbaajon ne niraash kiya, lekin ballebaaj prabhavit karne main safal rahe
 At one time the West Indies had lost nine wickets for a total of 170 runs, but Ravi Rampal (86 not out) and Kemar Roach (24 not out) shared their third highest partnership of 99 runs for the 10th wicket to a respectable total
 Was transported
 jahaan tak motera kii baat he, to is maidan par bhartiya team kaa pradarshan acha nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Here the Indian team has played a total of 14 matches, of which it has won in six, while it has lost in seven
 ek match radd hua he
 India's record against the West Indies has not been good at this ground
 donon tiimon ke bich is maidan par ab tak kul chaar match khele gaye hai, jinamein se teen main mehmaan team ko jeet mili he, jabaki ek main bharat jeeta he
 After winning two matches, the Indian team has the upper hand and the morale of the players is on the seventh sky, but the Caribbean team is also not low in this case
 usne katak main kade sangharsh ke baad bharat ko jeetne diya tha or vishakhapattanam main uske ballebaajon ne maan rakhaa
 Caribbean captain Darren Sammy has said that his team has undoubtedly lost in two matches, but his morale is still very high and he will try to return to the series through the remaining three matches
 motera kaa record mehmaan team ko vaapasi ke liye jaruri aatmbal pradaan karegaa or bhartiya team kaa utaar-chadhaav bharaa pradarshan is kaam main uski madad karegaa, lekin shrunkhlaa apane naam karne ke liye mehmaanon ko apane str se kaaphi ooncha uthakar khelnaa hoga
 Today, for the fourth time, the Rajasthan government will introduce a bill to give five percent reservation to Gurjars in the assembly
 har baar aarakshan 50 fisadi se zyada hone ke naam par court gurjar aarakshan par roak laga detaa he
 But this time the government says that the five percent reservation for Vogurjars, not the bill, will give notifications and the government will bring a reservation amendment bill for the power to issue these notifications
 is bill main vidhansabha main rakhaa jayega ki chunki saal 1994 main jatiyon kii sankhya 54 thi, lekin ab 91 jatiyaan ho gai hai
 Therefore, there is a need to give reservation in the proportion in which the castes and population have increased
 varsh 1931 kii jansankhya ke aadhaar parrajasthanmen kul 49 fisadiarakshanhai, jise ab badhaane kii jarurat he
 In fact, the Chopra Committee, formed after the Gurjar agitation, had promised to give five per cent reservation to the Gurjars on 15 December 2007, after which the Rajasthan government introduced a bill in the Assembly in 2008 giving five percent and 15 percent reservation to the Gurjars financially to the forward
 
 lekin tab aarthik rup searakshan kaa praavdhananheen hone kii vajah se court ne is par roak laga di thi
 Then on July 30, 2009, the government separately reserved five percent for Gurjars
 tab rajya main kulaarakshan54 fisadi ho gaya
 The Rajasthan High Court stayed more than 50 per cent reservation
 uske baad 6 may 2010 ko 50 fisadi aarakshan kaa praavdhaan maanate hue sarkaar ne ek fisadiarakshangurjaron ko diya or tab se ye maamla court main hi chal rahaa he
 But Gurjar leader Colonel Kirori Singh Bainsla disagrees
 unka kahana he ki obisi ko do bhaag main baantkar 50 fisadi ke andar hi aarakshan den, taaki hamaara aarakshan court main nahin atake
 Otherwise, reservation will be stuck in court again
 is baar sarkaar obisi kaa vargeekaran to kar rahi he, lekin obisi ke 21 fisadi main nahin, balki pichhali baar kii tarah hi alag se 5 fisadiarakshande rahi he
 This will bring the total reservation in the state to 54 percent again
 is baar ke aarakshan main bas itnaa hi antar he ki special catagariaarakshanki bajaae sarkaar ne obisi bhaag do ke naam se gurjaron koarakshande rahi he

 sahitya aaj tak: anuraag kashyap bole- jo poocha jayega wo bak duungaa, pange to hote rahete hai Cambridge Analytica is in the news for stealing data from Facebook
 bharat kii do badi raajnneetik partiyaan is maamle main ek-duusare par hamalavar hai
 The victims of Cambridge Analytica may also be Indians and the indications of this are coming from the allegations being leveled against each other by the bjp-congress
 maujuuda daur main data sabase keemtee cheez he
 On the occasion of the launch of Jio, the largest company in the telecom sector in India, Mukesh Ambani had said that data is the new oil
 
 
 ab aap is baat kaa andaja laga sakate hai data kitna mahatvapurn hai
 Please tell that there are 200 million Facebook users in India, that is, every sixth Indian Facebook uses
 america ke baad bharat main fasebuk yujar sabase zyada hai
 Why is it worrying that the data will be stolen if we tell you that there is a third person between Facebook and you, who is monitoring your activities on Facebook and can create your character profile through it
 cambridge analitica ne kiya kyacambridge uniwarsity ke lekturer alexander kogan ne cambridge analitica ke saath milakar ek ap banaaya tha, jisko naam diya gaya dis ij yor digital life
 For this app, he teamed up with his firm Global Science Research and Cambridge Analytica to create a personality quiz to collect information about his choice from thousands of people
 in yugers ko ped kiya gaya or unase kaha gaya ki is data kaa upyog academix ke liye kiya jayega
 This is where things started to look suspicious
 is ap ne in walantirs ke frends ke bare main bhi jaankaree jutai, fasebuk ke mutabik iskaa upyog ap experions ko badhanaa tha, na ki beche jane or vigyaapan ke liye tha
 Facebook has admitted that at least 2 lakh 70 thousand people had downloaded this app and shared their personal information
 lakhon americanyon se jutaya gaya yah data pehle walantier group ke doston kaa tha
 According to the whistleblower in the case, this data was used to create a profile of each American voter in the 2014 election
 iskaa makasad in sabhi logon ko raajnneetik vigyapanon ke jariye target karnaa tha
 Chris Willis, former research director at Cambridge Analytica, explained what he did to gather all this information
 cambridge analitica ne kaise jutai jaankarivislabloar ne british akhbaar objarwar ko bataaya, 'hamane fasebuk yugers kii profile main send lagaai or iske jariye ek model banaaya ki ham unke bare main kya jaanate hai
 The entire company was formed on this basis
 'iske baad cambridge analitica ne fasebuk ke karodon yugers kii profile se data churaayaa taaki chunaavon main unhen raajnneetik rup se target kiya ja sake
 Why You Should Be Concerned With the case of stealing data from Cambridge Analytica's Facebook profile, it is clear that any company (not just Cambridge Analytica) can target you
 or yah koi halki baat nahin he
 This is a very serious concern
 bataa den ki soshal media cites fasebuk or cambridge analitica jaisi companiyaan elgoridam kaa upyog karti hai, jo aapke likes par aadhaarit hai
 With the system built on the basis of these likes, they can gather information about your sexual orientation, likes and dislikes, relationship status, political trends, drug addiction and all manner of things
 cambridge analitica jaisi companiyaan inke aadhaar par aapaki puri profile bana sakati hai, sirf iske jariye ki aap fasebuk par kya like karte hai
 You do not need to write anything, nor to post a photo or give a statement
 ab jaaniye ravishankar prasad ne congress par kya aarope lagaabijapi netaa or kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne buudhvaar ko aarope lagaaya ki cambridge analitica ke congress party ke saath sambandh hai
 He said what is the role of Cambridge Analytica in the social media profile of Congress President Rahul Gandhi

 Surjewala has made serious allegations on BJP
 The Congress leader said that among the achievements of these companies is to manage four successful election campaigns for the ruling BJP
 unhone daawa kiya ki cambridge ke sthaneey saajhedaar obiai ne 272 plus kaa lakshya hasil karne kii baat kii he
 He made the constituency wise data available to the BJP candidates and helped him in his national and state elections in Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Delhi
 prasad dwaara fasebuk ke bare main kiye gayi daavon ke bare main surajevaala ne kaha ki fasebuk se pradhanmantri ke kya sambandh hai, yah to vahi bataa sakate hai
 He said that he was the only Prime Minister of the country who had visited the Facebook office in Silicon Valley and met its founder Mark Zuckerberg
 ravishankar prasad ne fasebuk ko di chetavanisuchana praudyogiki or kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne soshal media plateform fasebuk ko aagaah kiya ki yadi usne desh kii chunaav prakriya ko kisi bhi avaanchit tareeke se prabhavit karne kaa prayaas kiya to use kadi karrwai kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 Prasad cautioned, "mark Zuckerberg you know better, we welcome the FB profile in India, but through the FB system if any data of Indians is stolen it will not be tolerated
" iti kanoon main hamaare paas kaaphi adhikaar hai, ham inkaa istemaal karenge

 as Finance Minister
 chidambaram ke naam kii ghoshnaa se pehle kai naamon par atakalbaaji ho rahi thi
 There was also the name of a couple who are considered non-political technocrats or experts
 koi sudhaaron ke jariye sahi kaam karata he or vah apane kaam main maahir he to isse kya fark padataa he ki vah shaks siyaasi he yaa gaiyr-siyaasi?netaaon kii praathamikta se saaf ho jaataa he ki agenda, vaastavik bhoomika or kuch adchanon ke maamle main arthshaastra kaa tark nahin balki rajnatik auchity kaa dhyaan rakhaa jane vaala he
 Where the vote will be effective, only the populist speeches given for electoral gains will be political etiquette
 2013-14 ke bajet-or agar ho paaya to 2014-15 ke bajet kii bhi ruparekha isi baat se tay hogi
 Chidambaram is considered one of the architects of the 1991 reform
 unki yah chhavi 1991-96 main unke vaanijya mantri rahane ke dauraan ubhari
 Quantitative restriction cuts and revamping export subsidies were important aspects, while there were many weak aspects as well
 1996-97 ke dream bajet ke bare main sochie
 The recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission turned him into a nightmare and it was recommended not by the Left parties but by the Finance Minister himself
 isse inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki netaa hone ke kaaran chidambaram jaanate hai ki raajnneeti asambhav ko saadhane kii kala nahin he
 Budget work is to give life to political consciousness
 2004 se 2008 tak chidambaram kaa vitt mantri ke rup main trek record dekhen
 Look at any indicator of deficit (financial, revenue, primary)
 sabase baari ghaataa 2008-2009 ke dauraan hua or ham jaanate hai ki us dauraan chidambaram vitt mantri the na ki pranab mukherjee, haalanki phijulkharjee kaa aarope mukherjee ne jhela
 It was Chidambaram who first pushed back the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act and stopped it in 2005-06
 unhone etharabm or vittiya cansolidation ko dafan hi kar diya or aisa bharosa karnaa dhristataa hi hogi ki ve in donon main kisi ko phir se waapas laaenge
 Increasing government spending is Chidambaram's legacy, a violation of the promise to reduce government spending subsidies
 (2004-2005 kaa food stamp or sirf garibon ke liye sabsidi par diya gaya bhaashan dekhen)
 Also there is the matter of tax reform
 misaal ke taur par vastu evam seva kar main rajyon se baatcheet or samajhaita shaamil he
 Although one should not decide in advance, Chidambaram's image as Home Minister does not give much credence to this matter
 iske alaava maanakeekaran, ekikaran, chhot kii samaapti or aamadani ko tex ke daayre main laana he
 As finance minister in UPA-1, Chidambaram had hinted at taxing things like the fringe benefit tax
 chidambaram ke aarambhik kaarykaal se chapa raaj bhi judaa hua he
 Higher government spending, higher tax rates, retrograde tax, cessation of cesses, raids to raise revenue and overshooting of losses do not build confidence
 yathartwaadee udyog or bazaar in sabko mahatv degaa or is sach se raahat mahasoos karegaa ki upie ke kisi duusare vitt mantri ne isse kam nuksaan nahin pahunchaaya hota
 However, those who are still lost in the credibility of the reforms of 1991 and believe that Chidambaram is fundamentally promoting trade and commerce may be shocked
 iskaa yah matlab nahin he ki kuch nahin hoga
 GAAR and tax reforms (especially fines and interest) will be withheld from the previous date
 vittiya kshetra main kuch sudhaar laae jaaenge jisase niveshkon ke aatmavishvaas main vruddhi ho
 It is about the big reforms that both the Center and the State are concerned with
 yahaan do chetavaniyaan hai
 The first is that announcing the reforms and then worrying about the consequences has not been his predecessor
 chidambaram ke kaarykaal main koi bhi aakarshak ghoshnaa (pension, banking, insurance, epadi, petroleum padaarthon kaa mulya) jab tak puri tarah lagu na ho jaae, use andeh kii najar se dekha janaa chahie
 Barring 1991, there was never a big bang
 duusari yah ki sudhaar sirf mantriyon dwaara nahin laae jate
 The finance ministry has a bureaucracy and is lacking in both number and quality
 aise kathin samay main zyada badi ummid nahin paalna hi behatar he
 Weapons of economic reforms Chidambaram's hands will be tied to the so-called inclusive agenda and he will take care of India more than India
 isse india yaa bharat kisi kaa bhi laabh hoga yaa nahin, yah alag bahes he
 Well, they will work under these compulsions and that is why they are in the finance ministry and not replaced by an apolitical technocrat or a leader who does not have the skills to make the budget and withdraw the promises made in Fitoor
 yah sab ghalmail lag rahaa he, lekin kya karen, halaat hi aise hai

 sarkari aankadon ke anusaar har rose 4 se lekar 14 mautein ho rahi hai or sthiti ab bhi gambhir bani hui he, rajasthan ke aspataalon main aaj bhi 63 aise mariz hai jo ICU main bhartee hai or inamen se 27 ventilator par hai
 Most deaths are in people between 26 and 50 years old, more than 100 deaths have been recorded, while the relief is that swine flu in children is less visible this time
 lekin garbhvatee mahilaayein hai risk group main hai, jaise 23 saal kii santosh, 8 maheene se garbhvatee he, 5 din se sardi zukam or bukhaar he, privet clinics main ilaaj karvaa rahi thim, jab koi asar nahin hua to phir sarkari aspataal pahunchi he
 Arriving late for treatment not only threatens the life of the patient, but the lack of super specialty medical care is also being realized in Rajasthan
 rajasthan main super speciality ICU sirf 6 bade medical collejon main hai, yani 5 se 6 zilon ke bich ek bada aspataal
 Swine flu treatment can be done in the district hospital, but there are not all facilities icus here
 yahaan tak ki inke paas swine flu jaanch karne kii suvidha bhi nahin he
 Blood samples are taken at the district hospital and then sent to a large hospital for examination
 aisi sthiti main sarkaar bhi khud maanati he ki swine flu jaisi tezi se failati beemaari ke saamne chikitsa vyavastha charmara rahi he
 'there should be an infirmary disease hospital all over Rajasthan which is connected to medical colleges, as well as separate arrangements for serious patients, these things can save the critical patients
 ' aisa kahana tha dow
 Ashok Pangariya who is the chairman of the Swine Flu Task Force of Rajasthan
 zaahir he swine flu ke prakope ne rajasthan main super speciality or ICU kii pole to khol hi di he, lekin saath-saath is baat kaa khulaasa bhi kiya he ki sarkaar ne swine flu ko pehle hi rokane ke liye koi thos qadam nahin uthaae the

 The cabinet of Punjab has become one of the new villains of Sidhu's cabinet after he twice hugged Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javedbajwak, the killer of dozens of Indian soldiers
 general bajva ko jhappi dene ke baad siddhu ne use sahi sabit karne kii koshish jarur kii lekin vah kaamyaab nahin hue
 Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh himself has termed Sidhu's move as wrong
 captain amarinder singh ne ravivaar ko kaha tha ki general bajva kii dress par baqayda unka naam khuda tha isliye unako gale lagane kii galati nahin kii jaani chahie thi
 Sidhu's difficulties have increased as he steps back on the country's soil
 vah nae vivaad ke baad media se bachate najar aa rahe hai
 On Monday, when Sidhu was asked for his answer, Sidhu went on to say that when he has to answer, he will give it to everyone and he will reply with impunity
 lekin haal philhal navjot singh siddhu ke paas un darjanon sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin he jinke chalate vah ab bhartiya raajnneeti kaa ek nayaa khalanaayak ban gaye hai
 Not only politicians are asking this question, but the families of those hundreds of martyred soldiers who were shot dead by the Pakistan Army are also asking what was the need to embrace their killer
 udhar jab siddhu se jude nae vivaad ko lekar punjab kii ek pramukh vipakshi party shiromani akali dal se baat kii gai to party ne siddhu ke khilaaf kadi anushaasanamak karrwai karne kii maang kar daali
 Taking a dig at Sidhu, Shiromani Akali Dal spokesperson and general secretary Dr Daljit Singh Cheema said that when Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh himself has declared Sidhu's move wrong, why should Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi remain silent on the matter Huh
 cheema ne kaha, 'ab to main samajhataa hum ki hamaare kehane kii koi jarurat hi nahin rah gai kyonki unke khud ke mukhyamantri ne kah diya he ki pakistan sena pramukh ke saath is tarah kaa vyavhaar karnaa sahi nahin tha
 We had said this to them earlier that if you are doing this, then you should know what message you want to give to the people of India, our soldiers who have been martyred for the country and their family
 lekin ab to congress ke mukhyamantri ne khud bol diya ab dekhne vaali yah he ki congress haikaman sonia gandhi rahul gandhi kya faisla lete hai
 'cheema said, Kirahul Gandhihar does many things for the soldiers in Parliament every day, does many things for the country, does many things for Kashmir, so it is time that his own leader in Pakistan If they have come, then they should tell what action they are going to take on behalf of the party
