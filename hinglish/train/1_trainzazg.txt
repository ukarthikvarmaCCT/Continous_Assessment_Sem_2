piemo ke kisi adhikari ne dabaav nahin daalaa, magar congress saansadon ne kaha ki piem kaa naam nahin aana chahie
 Who said it is not remembered
 baaki taarikh vagairah to unhen sab yaad hai
 Vinod Rai has written in the book that the Law Ministry wrote a letter to the PM, questioning the process of allocation of 2G spectrum, the Finance Ministry wrote a letter to the PM
 vaanijya mantri kamalnath ne bhi chetaya kaha ki isaki samiksha mantriyon ke samooh main ho
 The king also wrote a letter and told what they were going to do
 tab bhi pradhanmantri ne koi ection nahin liya
 If they had stopped the king, history would have been different today
 e raja ne chitthee main pradhanmantri ko sab pataa diya tha, lekin piem ne saaf stand lene ke bajaae itnaa likhaa ki aapaki chitthee mil gai he
 No action
 purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh kaa purana bayaan hai ki unhone raja se pehle aao pehle paao niti ke prati apni chintaa jataa di thi
 Today after this interview, Prakash Jhavekar on behalf of BJP said that the answer given by the Prime Minister in Parliament and which is on file is different
 unhone kabhi e raja kaa virodh nahin kiya iskaa matlab he ki ve raja kaa samarthan kar rahe the
 The former Prime Minister should answer
 congress javabdehi se nahin batch sakati kyonki yah aarope 10 janpath par bhi jaataa he
 Congress leader Kamal Nath said that he had written and talked by saying that there was a mess, but the former Prime Minister did not take any step
 unhone badi galati kii
 Did Kamal Nath tell this to the Congress Party chief Sonia Gandhi, who was also the chairperson of the UPA
 prakaash jaavdekar ne das janpath se jawaab maanga to uske pados main maujuud congress mukhyalay main abhishek manu singhvi jawaab dene aa gaye
 Said what Vinod Rai has said in the CAG report
 aaj ve usee baat ko doharaa rahe hai taaki kitaab kii bikri bad jaae
 On the basis of these allegations, several petitions were given in the court that notices be issued to the former Prime Minister and former Finance Minister, but the court did not accept
 tab kyon nahin vinod raay ne khud ek exiaar file kar di
 What is the point of telling those things today
 iske baad abhishek manu singhvi purv mahalekhaakaar ko yaad dilaane lage ki unhen sirf congress kii sarkaron kii report hi kyon yaad rahati he
 Why not talk about the CAG report on the Gujarat government
 jisamen sieji ne kaha he ki rajya sarkaar ne saadhe paanch hazaar karod kaa rajasav sarplus galat dikhaaya
 The Gujarat government failed to recover many types of taxes
 aath hazaar se 16 hazaar karod kaa bakaayaa rah gaya
 No book of Rai Sahab has come about this
 internet par vicharan kar rahaa tha to 3 disambar 2012 kii indian express kii ek report mili
 The statement was by RP Singh, a retired officer from the CAG and former Director General of Post and Telecommunication
 unke sahyogi piesi ke mukhiya murali manohar joshi ke ghar gaye wo bhi sarkari chuttee ke din
 To help create the report of the PAC
 sieji mukhyalay kii taraf se unhen is report par dastakhat karne ke liye kaha gaya
 While they did not agree with the report
 piesi kii report main pradhanmantri, vittamantri, atarni general kii aalochana kii gai thi
 Obviously, this too must have been denied, but it was mentioned that how long and how far such things should be taken seriously
 vinod raay ne jo kaha usamen nayaa kya he
 This matter is in court
 centre main sarkaar bhi badal gai he
 Will BJP continue to take up the matter politically or will it take any official step
 kya bijepi maanati he ki unke khilaaf bhi aapraadhik maamla banataa he
 What will the Congress do after Kamal Nath's statement
 shila dikshit ke bayaan kii tarah kinaaraa karegi yaa vinod raay ke bayaan kii aalochana kii aupchaarikta nibhaa kar kinare ho jaaegi
 Relations between the US and Iran are once again deteriorating
 haalanki, america ke raashtrapati donald trump iran ke saath sambandhon par bayaan de chuke hai ki iran ke saath america yuddh kii disha main aage nahin bad rahaa he
 Meanwhile, Iran has said that it can easily target American ships in Gulf countries
 haal ke dinon main washington or tehran ke bich tanaav apane charam par he
 Iran's diplomats are constantly trying to defy US sanctions and reduce US opposition to the nuclear deal

 The US withdrew some of its diplomats from Baghdad following the attack on four oil tankers this week
 purv main baraak obama prashasan ne iran ke saath newclear deal kii thi jise trump prashasan ne 2015 main khatm kar diya tha
 Due to this move of Trump, harsh sanctions were once again in force on Iran
 iran kii arthvyastha america pratibandhon kii vajah se prabhavit ho gai he
 Discounts on oil imports to countries like India, China and Pakistan have also been stopped
 fars news agency ko die gaye ek bayaan main iran ke islamic revolutionari guard corps (iarjisi) ke dipti commander saleh joker ne kaha, 'hamaari kam duuri tak maar karne vaali misile bhi america yupoton ko khadi ke deshon main aasaani se nishaanaa bana sakati hai
 'he said,' America cannot afford a new war
 saamaajik or maanav sansadhano ke lihaaj se america kii sthiti buree he
 On US economic sanctions, Iran believes that Washington is only increasing economic sanctions to increase its military share in Gulf countries
 america iran par sanyukt raashtra par hamale kaa hawala dekar vaishvik dabaav badhaane ke prayaas main he
 Tehran says the US move is only for psychological gain and political rhetoric
 washington main ek varisht prashasnic adhikari ne kaha ki america iran se baatcheet ke liye taiyaar he lekin iran trump ke saath sidhi vaarta ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 "we believe that Iran should come forward to reduce tensions between the two countries and be ready for talks," the official said
 'raashtrapati donald trump iran ke netaaon se newclear program par baatcheet karne ke liye kai baar apil kar chuke hai

 But the third forces are bent on destroying a large part of the world
 iraq or katar ke bich ek red desk kii sthapana kii jaani jisase donon rashtron ke bich tanaav kaa khaatmaa ho
 Iran's supreme leader Yatullah Khomeini said this week that Tehran is not ready to negotiate any new nuclear deal
 2015 main trump prashasan ne deal tod diya, iran ke paas newclear bam bane kii puri kshamta he, iran par pratibandh thope gaye
 Now the issue of nuclear deal is being raised to avoid international sanctions
 haalanki trump kaa maananaa he ki aarthik nitiyon ko dabaav ke chalate iran majabuuran missile or anya newclear kaaryakramon par roak lagayegaa, or iraq, syria or yaman main iran apni pakad dhili karegaa
 Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javed Zarif said during a visit to Japan and China that mere statements of support would not be enough to save the nuclear deal
 iran ke videsh mantri mohammad jawaad jarif ne china or rus sahit apane mitra deshon se apil kii ki ve 2015 ke parmaanu qaraar se america ke alag ho jane ke baad is samjhaute ko bachaane ke liye thos kadam uthaaen
 Iran also appealed to Britain, Germany, France to protect Iran's economy from US sanctions
 iran main vaishvik pratibandhon kii vajah se mahangaai 40 fisadi tak adhik bad gai he
 Iran's economy has been severely affected for many years by sanctions imposed by the international community on Iran's nuclear program, in 2015 by President Hassan Rouhani to limit Iran's nuclear activities in return for the removal of those restrictions by the US and five other countries An agreement was agreed with

 Trump's national security adviser John Bolton and Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have been spearheading the Trump government's campaign of maximum pressure against Iran
 iran ke revolutionari guard ke ek adhikari ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki iran kii misile faras kii khadi main sthit yudhpot tathaa pashchim asia ke kisi bhi hisse main aasaani se pahunch sakati hai
 The semi-official news agency Fars quoted Mohammad Saleh Jokar as saying that Iran's missiles could go up to two thousand kilometers and strike any location in the area
 gauratlab he ki trump ne baraak obama kii sarkaar ke dauraan iran ke saath hue parmaanu samjhaute se america ko baahar kar diya tha

 During the hearing on the matter related to air pollution, the NGT said that the situation in Delhi is getting worse from pollution, but you still have no action plan to deal with it
 gauratlab he ki pradooshan ko lekar pichhali sunwaayee parashanghthne dilli sarkaar or dilli ke padosi rajyon se ection plan maanga tha
 In today's hearing, the rest of the states gave the NGT an action plan to deal with pollution, but the Delhi government failed to give its action plan, which the NGT was angry about
 ngtne kaha ki dilli kii aabo hawa dinodin kharaab hoti ja rahi he or sabase zyada bura asar bacchon par pad rahaa he, lekin sarkaar halaat se nipatane ke liye taiyaar hi nahin dikh rahi he
 The NGT has given 48 hours to the Delhi government, in which the Delhi government will have to submit its action plan to the court
 ngtisa maamle kii sunwaayee 6 disambar ko dobaaraa karegaa
 During the hearing, questions were also raised about the test match being held in Ferozeshah, that the match is being done even after the pollution has reached dangerous levels, but the NGT said that it is the task of the Authority (BCCI) to decide whether the match should be done or not

 Since the recession of nearly a decade ago, the condition of real estate is not improving significantly
 haal yah he ki mumbai ke kai project main kareeb 4,000 karod rupee mulya ke lagjri makaan banakar taiyaar khadey hai, lekin unke liye kharidaar nahin mil rahe
 Amid the builders' efforts to complete residential projects on time, a large variety of houses worth a total of Rs 4,000 crore in the southern and south-central areas of the Mumbai metropolis are set to be sold in ready condition
 samachar agency pitiai ke mutabik, pichley saal isi samay is tarah ke taiyaar khadey makaanon kaa stock kareeb 2,800 karod rupee mulya kaa tha
 According to property experts, luxury housing projects worth about Rs 75,000 crore are running late by seven years due to various reasons
 isamen samay par anumati nahin milane vaali pariyojnaayen bhi shaamil hai
 As such, developers in Maharashtra Rera have issued a new deadline for the completion of these projects in late March
 anarok property kansaltent ke nideshak ashutosh limaae ne pitiai se kaha, 'nakadi kii kami, anumati milane main deree, vivaad or kuprabandhan jaise vibhinn kaarnon ke chalate nirmaan main deree hoti he
 Due to RERA rules, developers are also giving more time than the actual completion period for the projects
 isamen se kuch abhi bhi pariyojnaon par kabja dilaane main asaksham he
 According to the data, by March 2018, assets worth Rs 2,500 to 2,800 crore were on sale, which increased to Rs 4,000 crore in March 2019
 real estate ke liye pichhlaa saal acha to tha, lekin bikri us tarah se paravaan nahin chadh pai he
 There is a pressure situation in this sector on both the demand and supply front
 developers ne makaan banakar taiyaar kar die hai, lekin bazaar main kharidaar nahin hai
 That is, there is a supply of houses, but there is a softening in its demand
 aise main sarkaar is sector ko lagaataar raahat dene kii koshish kar rahi he
 This time the budget was interim, but the bundle of gifts for real estate was the heaviest in this budget
 ghar kharidaaron or ghar bechney waalon ko to vitt mantri ne sahuuliyat dene kaa elaan kiya hi, saath hi developers kii kai puraani maangen ek jatke main maan lee gayi
 Recently, the GST Council has reduced the GST rate on affordable housing properties under construction from 8 percent to 1 percent and for the non-affordable housing segment under other construction properties it has been reduced from 12 percent to 5 percent

 Prashant Kishore, who played the role of Narendra Modi's strategist in 2014, is being speculated to return home
 yani ek baar phir se wo 2019 ke chunaav main narendra modi ke liye kaam karenge
 It is said in this episode that he has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 par jis vakt piem se unki mulaakaat kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 During that time, Prashant Kishor has met Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi more than Modi
 aise main modi ke saath wo dobaaraa se kaam karenge, is baat main dam kam najar aa rahi he
 Talking to Aaj Tak, a close aide of Prashant Kishore said that meeting someone does not mean that Prashant is going to handle his publicity
 piem se mulaakaat ko tool diya ja rahaa he, jabaki rahul-priyanka se prashanth kishor kai baar mili hai
 He said that in August, Prashant's mother died due to cancer, while his father is very ill, so he is not working for any party these days
 bas, andhra pradesh main wiesar congress kaa kaam main pehle se unke paas he, jo unki team dekh rahi he
 The close says that how will anyone refuse if PM, Rahul or Priyankam meet Prashant
 piem modi, rahul gandhi yaa phir priyanka gandhi ho, ye sabhi prashanth kishor se siyaasi haalat or bhavishya kii ranneeti par raay maangate hai to apni baat kah dente hai
 This does not mean that he has joined them for 2019

 In 2014, BJP is not going to do well in 2019
 haalanki, prashanth ke kareebi ye bhi kehete hai ki, karnataka chunaav ke baad hi 2019 kii asli tasviir saaf hona shuru hogi
 He said that the BJP will not get the benefit of the issue of Ram temple in the 2019 elections and the tense atmosphere between India and Pakistan
 kyonki 2014 main modi ko vot yuva ne rojgaar or kisaanon va garibi ne apane behatar bhavishya ke liye diya tha
 In such a situation, people will not vote for Modi on the issue of Ram temple and Pakistan
 bijepi ke saath 2019 ke liye kaam karne kii khabaron ko prashanth ke karibiyon ne puri tarah bhraamak bataaya
 Also said that, the meeting is being exaggerated
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki prashanth kishor kii piem modi ke saath mulaakaat hui he, jise lekar wo manaa nahin kar rahe hai
 But no decision has been taken yet to work with BJP in 2019
 ayodhya maamle main ek paksh akhil bhartiya akhaada parishad ke adhyaksh pad ko lekar vivaad khadaa ho gaya he or mukhya vaadi hanumangadhi ke mahant gyaandas ne daawa kiya he ki vah ab bhi hindu santon kii sheersh ikai ke adhyaksh hai
 Gyanadas told reporters, "I am still the legal and real president of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad and by January 30, i will prove who is in the majority and who is in the minority
" ’ unki yah tippanee parishad sadasyon kii shuukravaar ko elahabaad main hui baithak ke baad ai he jisamen nae padaadhikari chune gaye
 Gyanandas alleged that it is illegal to elect Balwant Singh of Nirmal Akhara as President of the Akhara Council
 parishad ke pravaktaa ramanand puri ne kaha tha ‘akhil bhartiya akhaada parishad kii baithak main nirmal akhaade ke balavant singh ko aam sahmati se parishad adhyaksh or anand akhaade ke shankaranand giri ko mahasachiv chunaa gaya
 Puri, who belonged to Niranjani Akhara and the head priest of Mansa Devi Temple Trust in Haridwar, said that all 13 akhadas of the council attended the meeting except Juna and Awahana Akhara
 mahant gyaandas ne haalanki kaha ‘kya jaldi thi ki bina agenda ke parishad ko bhang kar diya gaya or nae padaadhikari chun liye gaye
 All this is done through manipulations and not meetings
 ’ unhone kaha ‘parampara ke vipareet na to mujhe or na hi parishad ke sachiv ko baithak main shaamil hone ke liye bulaayaa gaya
 Gyanadas alleged that this hurdle is being created by those who are 'running shoplifting' in the name of Ram temple movement and who are against the peaceful resolution of the Ayodhya dispute
 unhone aarope lagaaya ‘vivaadaaspad mudde (ayodhya vivaad) ke sauhardpurn samaadhaan ke prayaas raajnneetik logon or isi tarah ke anya logon ko nahin bha rahe
 Gyanadas said that the two office bearers, Vice President Mitra Prakash Singh and Treasurer Jagtar Muni, who attended Friday's meeting, resigned their posts last year
 mahant ne kaha ‘unhone (singh or muni) ne pichley saal navambar main istipha diya tha or mere paas unke tyaagptr kii pratiyaan hai
 He said that the ongoing efforts of the Akhara Council's internal affairs will not have any impact on the ongoing efforts for a amicable solution to the Ram temple issue

 Many supporters were seen crying

 According to sources, the Congress will keep a close watch on the meeting of mlas convened by Akhilesh and Mulayam

 Sources say that now the ball is in the Governor's court and he will ask for floor test in the assembly

 Rahul and Jayant have given confidence to support Akhilesh
 jayant ne rahul se baat karne ke baad akhilesh ko sandesh diya ki ham sab saath hai
 Mulayam Singh took this action on Friday after Ram Gopal called the party's conference
 unhone kaha ki anushaasanheenata bardaasht nahin kii jaaegi
 Whoever attends the conference will be expelled from the party
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki ummidavaaron kii list banane kaa adhikaar keval party adhyaksh ko he, doosraa koi nahin bana saktaa he
 Shivpal Yadav has written a letter urging the party workers not to attend Ram Gopal Yadav's meeting
 lakhanu main aanan-fanan main bulaae gaye press conference mensapa mukhiya ne kahaaki ramgopal akhilesh yadav ko gumraah kar unka bhavishya khatm kar rahe hai
 Mulayam Singh said that this big decision has been taken after breaking the discipline of the party
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki ramgopal kaa party main koi yogadan nahin he
 At the same time, Mulayam said that the involvement of party leaders and ministers in the summit session of Ram Gopal will also be considered as undemocratic
 mulaayam kii maane to ramgopal kaa party main koi yogadan nahin he
 After removing Akhilesh from the party, Mulayam said that who will be the next chief minister, he is going to announce him soon, because this is his right

 Sometime later Ram Gopal Yadav hit back saying that Yanishkasan was completely unconstitutional
 notice dene ke aadhe ghante ke andar hi donon ko party se baahar nikaal diya gaya, donon ko jawaab dene vakt tak nahin diya gaya
 Ram Gopal alleged that unconstitutional work was going on in the party
 ramgopal ne kaha ki netaji koparty kaa samvidhancchhi tarah se pataa he
 Ramgopal said that as far as the convening of the party conference is concerned, this conference has been called on the demand of the workers
 unhone kaha ki jab gaiyr yadavon ke bich vot maangane kii baat aati he to phir mulaayam ko ramgopal yaad aate hai or unhen logon ke bich kaam karne ke liye kisi sarkaar kii jarurat nahin he
 Ramgopal says that Shivpal's leadership has made candidates like him who have no ground hold and will not even survive their bail in the elections
 isi ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane se nishkasana kaa ye galat kadam uthaaya gaya he
 At the same time, Ram Gopal said that the public knows who his CM is and in the coming days it will show the right results

 Akhilesh has called a meeting of party legislators at his residence on Saturday

 khabaron ke mutabik kutton kii vajah se bushara isliye pareshaan thim kyonki wo majahabi khatun hai or unke ruhani routine main isse khalal ho rahaa tha
 
 bushara kii ye duusari shaadi he or imran kii teesri
 The marriage of both of them was announced on 18 February this year
 bushara ke pehali shaadi se paanch bachche hai
 Imran Khan was married first to Jemima Goldsmith and second to Reham Khan
 unki pehali shaadi nau saal or duusari shaadi mahaj 10 maheene hi chali
 According to reports in Pakistani media, rumors of Bushra getting angry and leaving the house also got a boost because his sisters have also been seen in Imran's house who were strongly angry with Imran and Bushra's marriage
 karibiyon ne khaarij kii khabaris puri kahani kaa doosraa rukh tab saamne aayaa jab islamabad main 'ajtak' reporter hamaja amir ne imran khan ke kareebi logon se baat kii
 He described this news as baseless

 First tried to find out whether Bushra reached her maternal home after leaving Imran's house in Islamabad
 bushara kaa maayka pakistan ke punjab main pakpattan main he
 But Bushra's arrival there was also not confirmed
 yahi nahin, jis pakistani akhbaar ‘rojaanaa ummat’ ne bushara ke naaraaz hokar ghar chhodkar jane kii report prakashit kii thi, usko imran khan kii party ‘pakistan taharik-e-insaaf’ (PTI) ne notice bheja he
 According to this notice, on April 22, a website has been published on the website about Imran Khan's personal life, which has no basis
 notice main kaha gaya he ki aisi khabar chhapane se pehle naa to imran khan se koi baatcheet kii gai or naa hi kisi se poocha gaya
 It has also been said in the notice that if no apology is given on this, then be prepared to face action
 pakistan main viral test ke liye reporter kii padtaal or tamaam logon se baatcheet ke baad yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki imran or bushara ko lekar faili khabar kam se kam abhi pakki nahin he

 'nude' and 'S Durga' judges B
 Vinod Chandran, not shown at the Goa Film Festival, had directed the ministry to screen the film at the 48th edition of the Indian International Film Festival, accepting the petition of director Sanal Kumar Sasidharan
 adaalat ne apane aadesh main kaha tha ki film kii pramanit prati somvaar se shuru hue mahotsav main pradarshit kii ja sakati he
 The film, which was 'disowned' here for fear of inciting religious sentiments, the director said- According to the sources like indo-iran, s Durga does not matter to change the name of the film now because the film was sent to the jury only when it was named Sexy Durga
 
 mantralay ne is film ko mumbai film festival main nahin dikhaae jane ke bare main film mahotsav kii diarector anupama chopra ko 19 sitambar ko chithti likhi thi
 It states that Durga is the name of a prominent goddess of Hindus and the ministry believes that if the film is allowed to be shown at the film festival, it will hurt people's religious sentiments

 test siries main england ke haathon 3-1 se jillat jhelane ke baad team india mangalvaar se shuru hone vaali vanade siries main achche pradarshan kii ummid kar rahi thi, lekin barish ne pehle match main uski ummiido par pani pher diya
 In the remaining matches of the series, India will now try to come out of the nightmare of defeat, while the hosts will try to take the dominance of the Test series
 haalanki bharat ne jis tarah kaa pradarshan test siries main kiya tha, usko dekhte hue achaanak hi kisi chamatkaar kii ummid to nahin kii ja sakati, lekin sachai ye bhi he ki jab-jab team rangeen kapadon main maidan main utarati he to nattejey kuch or hi hote hai
 Team India needs new energy, of course, India may have performed extremely poorly in the Test series but it is expected that there will be a new start in the ODI series
 sachai bhi yahi he ki jab team kaa manobal bahut gira hua ho to us samay team ko sirf ek jeet kii jarurat hoti he
 If any one player gives a match on his stamina while performing with a bang, then the attitude of the entire team starts to change
 viraat kohli, shikhar dhawan, emes dhoni, rohit sharma, suresh raina ke rahete bharat kii ballebaaji kaaphi majboot he, bas jarurat he ki wo chal jaae
 In bowling, if Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami and Mohit Sharma manage to take advantage of the English condition, then the result can be seen in contrast to the Test series
 aswin ke rahete puri siries main kya karn sharma ko mauka milegaa ye ek sawaal jarur he
 But Sharma has put pressure on the team management by bowling heavily in the practice match
 fielding main team india ko thodi chusti dikhaani hogi
 Although there is not much scope for change in the team, but giving a chance to bowlers like Karn Sharma and Dhawal Kulkarni can be a profitable deal for Team India, because both these players perform well for India a in Australia

 On the question of failing to form a government in Karnataka, Amit Shah said that his job is to win elections, not to manipulate

 On the Karnataka results, Shah said that there has not been a big lapse with the BJP
 shah ne daawa kiya ki karnataka main bijepi ko 13 siton par nota se bhi kam voton se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa

 ek vakt tha, jab congress ke liye sab kuch thik chal rahaa tha
 They were born with silver spoons as heirs to large families (one of them is a member of the former royal family), they were fiercely eaten, listened to, and were also made ministers of state to get the experience of administration
 ab maahaul bahut badal gaya he
 Jyotiraditya Scindia, who has stepped into the fifth decade of age, Sachin Pilot, Milind Deora, Jitin Prasad and Deepender Hooda are suffering from 'peter Pan syndrome', and are struggling to improve
 peter pan vah balak tha, jo bada hone se inkaar karata rahaa
 The 49-year-old Rahul Gandhi, the former Congress president, is the pinnacle
 peter pan 'lost bwoys' kaa netaa tha, or agali peedi ke in netaaon kaa akelaapan or takalif itani zyaada bad rahi he ki peter pan or uske 'lost bwoys' se unki tulana nishchit rup se kii jaaegi
 Despite these people having no fault, their rise and fall happened in the same way as Rahul Gandhi
 madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri kamalnath tathaa 'super chif ministar' kahe jane vaale digvijay singh kii saavdhaan or chaalaak jodi ke khilaaf jyotiraditya sindhiya akele ladaai lard rahe hai
 Scindia used all valid methods and means to gain some strength
 akhbaaron main chape vigyaapan or deevaaron par lage hordings main pehle unhen mukhyamantri banaae jane kii maang kii gai thi, phir party kii pradesh ikai kaa pramukh banaae jane kii
 Forest Minister Umang Singhar, who is believed to be loyal to Jyotiraditya Scindia, has called Digvijay Singh a 'blackmailer', accusing him of 'being involved in liquor business and illegal sand mining'
 is bayaan ke baad unhone party kii maujuuda adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko ek khat bhi likhaa, jisamen unhone 'digvijay singh par parde ke peeche rahakar madhya pradesh sarkaar chalaane' kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 Scindia then came out in support of Umang Singhar at that time on Wednesday, and urged Kamal Nath to listen to Umang's talk and accusations, when Sonia did not respond to Singhar's demands
 loksabhaa chunaav main apni guna seat haar jane ke baad jyotiraditya sindhiya ko apane hi garh main lagbhag apraasangik bana diya gaya
 He wants to replace Kamal Nath as the state unit president of the party, but the party continues to catch him
 jab priyanka gandhi wadra ne mahasachiv (purv uttar pradesh) ke rup main raajnneeti main kadam rakhaa, jyotiraditya sindhiya ko pashchimi uttar pradesh kaa prabharee bana diya gaya
 When Rahul Gandhi left the post of Congress President, Jyotiraditya Scindia used the occasion as an opportune moment to leave a post he never wanted
 iske baad party ne unhen maharashtra ke aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav ke liye screening cameti kaa pramukh banaaya, or yah bhi aisa kaam he, jo vah nahin chaahate
 Now in the Congress, there is a lot of speculation that Jyotiraditya Scindia as well as Milind Deora, who has lost elections from Mumbai South Parliamentary constituency, are trying to leave the Congress and join BJP, for which the talks have reached far ahead, but on this occasion It is too early to get it right, but it is also clear that both the leaders are extremely restless, and also worried about their political future
 vastav main, jab se sonia gandhi or unke puraane sahyogiyon ne rahul se party kii kaman sanbhali he, puraane sahyogiyon kii gaaz yuva netaaon par hi gir rahi he
 The reason for his ambitions falling apart is that Scindia, Deora and Jitin Prasad have repeatedly publicly taken a different line from the party
 in teenon tathaa deependra hooda ne anuchhed 370 ko hataa die jane (jammu evam kashmir kaa vishesh darja khatm kar dena) kaa saarvajanik rup se swaagat kiya tha or jitin prasad ne haal hi pradhanmantri narendra modi ke jansankhya niyantran ke vichaar kaa swaagat kiya tha
 According to reliable sources, Jitin Prasad had already prepared to go to BJP before the Lok Sabha elections, and did not respond when asked by the media about his plan
 bataaya jaataa he ki rahul gandhi ke saath car main baithkar kiye gaye ek safar, jike dauraan unase congress main hi bane rahane kaa aagrah kiya gaya tha, ne unka iraadaa badal diya
 But it is then
 rahul ke jane ke baad vah BJP ke saath phir baatcheet karne lage
 Sachin Pilot, who has never hidden the desire to become the Chief Minister of Rajasthan, has remained completely silent in the current chaos contrary to his nature, which has become the definition of today's Congress
 sutron kaa kahana he ki vah BJP main apana bhavishya nahin dekh pate hai, kyonki rajasthan main BJP ke paas pehle se purv mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje or gajendra singh shekhavat hai, jo pradhanmantri narendra modi or BJP adhyaksh amit shah ke pasandida mantri hai
 So instead, he is quietly considering launching a regional party of his own
 unke nazadiiki sutron ne jor dekar kaha ki philhal yah sirf ek vichaar he, jiskaa moort rup lenaa is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav ke parinaam kya rahete hai
 The next generation of leaders in the Congress are angry at the lack of opportunities for advancement and the party's current ideological attachment

 We cannot even hold a protest on the ground about the bad state of the economy, because we have neither leadership nor activists

 In fact, Hooda's blackmail of leaving the party in the event of Sonia Gandhi's old senior colleagues explained to him, and not being given control, was successful
 isse yuva netaa zyaada naaraaz ho gaye, jinamein se ek ne kadavaahat-bhare swar main kaha, "congress main aage badhane ke liye aapako ek kaddavar netaa ke naam kaa sahaara chahie

 In a state where the rule has been in force since 2016 that no officer of the state can run in an expensive vehicle from the Chief Minister, in that state Chief Minister Trevinder Singh Rawat is running the Chief of Forest Department himself in a big and expensive car
 aise main baaki adhikariyon ke bare main kya kaha ja saktaa he
 However, this mandate was issued in 2016 when the Congress was in power in the state and its command was in the hands of Harish Rawat
 magar aadesh to aadesh hota he
 If something is going on against nimay-qaeda, then the current government and its head Trivendra Singh Rawat will be responsible for it
 kya he puraa maamalauttarakhandwan vibhaag ke mukhiya pccf(hoff) 20 lakh se bhi zyada mahangi inova (christa) car main chal rahe hai
 It is a matter of outright contempt of the Chief Minister and cabinet ministers
 uttarakhand parivahan vibhaag ne 10 march 2016 ko mantriyon or adhikariyon ke liye vaahan ke sambandh main ek aadesh jari kiya tha
 The order of the Transport Department states that Chief Forest Conservator level officers, including the Chief Minister, Cabinet Minister, Chief Secretary, High Court Judge, Director General of Police and Chief of Forest Department can use cars up to Rs 15 lakh
 magar is shasnadesh ko darkinar karte hue van vibhaag ke mukhiya 20 lakh rupee se bhi mahangi inova christa jaisi lagjri car se chal rahe hai
 This is not only an insult to the Chief Minister and Cabinet Ministers but also becomes a matter of contempt

 On one hand, the drum is being beaten by Uttarakhand government to reduce the expenses, on the other hand, the chief of the forest department is seen opening the pole of this drum
 karrwai kaa intjaruttarakhand ke kai vibhaagon main adhikari mahangi car main chal rahe hai or parivahan vibhaag ke adeshon kii dhajjiyaan uda rahe hai
 In such a situation, what is the importance of the order issued by the government
 uttarakhand sarkaar ke is shasnadesh ke anusaar ek adhikari- ek vaahan kaa niyam lagu he, lekin shashan main lagbhag prayek iees adhikariyon ke paas teen-teen kaaren hai
 Now in such a situation, the BJP Chief Minister, who is in power in the name of zero tolerance, will have to see what action they take against these officers

 in se saabhaar) There is a village in Betul district of Madhya Pradesh, where cattle foster does not sell milk, but gives it for free
 yah sunne or padhane main thodaa achraj main daalane vaala ho saktaa he, magar he sahi
 In Chudiya village of Betul district, with a population of about three thousand, people do not trade milk, instead use the home-produced milk in their family and give excessively produced milk to the needy for free
 is gaanv main koi bhi vyakti doodh bechney kaa kaam nahin karata
 Shivcharan Yadav, a purohit of the village, explains, "there used to be saint Chindhya Baba in the village about 100 years ago
 ve gosevak the, unhone gaanv waalon se doodh or usase nirmit saamagree kaa vikray na karne kaa aahvaan kiya, gaanv waalon ne baba kii baat maani, us ke baad se yahaan doodh nahin bechaa jaataa he
 "he said," It is now a tradition not to sell milk
 ab to yah dharna he ki yadi doodh kaa kaarobaar karenge to nuksaan hoga
 "the villagers tell that they have heard from their ancestors that Chindhya Baba has taught the villagers that it is a sin to adulterate milk, so no milk will be sold in the village and milk will be given free to the people
 sant chindhyaa baba kii baat pathar kii lakeer ban gai or tabhi se gaanv main doodh muft main mil rahaa he
 Local people say that in a village with a population of three thousand, 40 percent of the population belongs to the tribal class, while 40 percent of the people are cowherds, due to which a large number of cattle rearing is done here
 iske alaava yahaan anya jati varg kii aabaadi 20 pratishat he
 Village chief farmer Subhash Patel says, "chindhya Baba spoke about not selling milk so that the people of the village can use the milk so that they stay healthy
 chindhyaa baba kii kahi baat ko gaanv ke log ab bhi maanate aa rahe hai,jin gharon main doodh hota he or jinhen miltaa he, ve swasth hai,"unhone kaha, "gaanv kaa koi bhi parivaar doodh nahin bechata he, yadi dahi bhi banaai jaati he, to use bhi baant diya jaataa he, unhone is baat se bhi inkaar nahin kiya ki ab jinke paas doodh bachataa he ve usase ghi nikaalkar jarur bazaar main jaakar bech dete hai,"unhone kaha, "kuch parivaar ke log doodh se ghi banaakar jarur bechney lage hai,"ve aage bataate hai ki gaanv ke logon kaa mukhya vyavsaay kheti he, isliye doodh ko na bechney se unke saamne kisi tarah kii aarthik samasya nahin aati he
 Apart from tribal families, almost every household has cattle and all get the milk they need, who produce more milk, they provide milk to others
 baitool ke anuvibhageeya adhikari, rajasav (esadm) rajeev ranjan pandey kaa kahana he ki chudiya gaanv main muft main doodh bantata he, is tarah kii jaankaree unhen nahin he

 Aaj Tak has revealed that the work of checking the accounts of the IPL has been going on since 1 April and the result is that the Income Tax Department was raided on the IPL office on Thursday
 gauratlab he ki guuruuvaar ko mumbai main iskar vibhaag ne ipel or modi ke daftar par chapa maaraa or modi se lambii poochtacha kii
 For Lalit Modi, who has grown accustomed to flying success, the wind seems to be turning
 ipel kii kochi team ko lekar videsh rajyamantri shashi tharur se panga lene vaale lalit modi ab khud mushkilon main najar aa rahe hai
 It started on Thursday evening when two teams of the Income Tax Department raided two IPL bases together
 iskar vibhaag ne vankhade stadium or four sijans hotel main chal rahe ipel ke daftaron par chapa maaraa
 For about eight hours, this team kept searching the documents related to IPL
 is dauraan bisisiai ke chif administrative officer ratnakar shetty bhi yahaan maujuud the
 The documents related to the IPL examined include the bidding documents of IPL teams, franchise agreements of all teams, partnership documents of teams, accounts book from the beginning of IPL and all income tax papers
 iskar vibhaag ke adhikari lalit modi ke ek auki thikaane par pahunche the jahaan modi se iskar adhikariyon kii lambii poochtacha hui
 After two hours of investigation, two black bags and a yellow box were present with the team of IT officers when they left from there

 Especially what are the names and profiles of all the people who have invested money on Kochi? How much money have these people invested in IPL and what is their real source of money? If you think there is no transparency in the Randevu group then what is the basis for this? People who put money in IPL, they give check or cash? Where are these money deposited? How much money has the IPL raised through franchisees so far? What is the way to transact money? How much money has been invested from Dubai and the outskirts of the country? Who are the people who invest money from abroad? Are all these investments legally sure? How much did the IPL earn in three years? And how much tax did the IPL pay in these three years? Apparently, in this interrogation, which took 10 hours from Lalit Modi, the Income Tax officials tried to scrutinize all the questions that were buried for the last three years and the controversy over the Kochi team has been dispelled

 The Shiv Sena MP said that there is a problem with the departments that are being given to us because important ministries like Home, Finance, Revenue and Urban Development have already been allocated to BJP ministers
 unhone kaha, 'adarsh tarika yah he ki baatcheet dotarafa honi chahie, lekin yahaan ve chaahate hai ki ve jo bhi hamen den, ham use sweekaar kar len
 He said that despite having 18 Lok Sabha members, Shiv Sena was given only one seat in the Union Cabinet and that too a non-important department like heavy industry
 
 
 
 Another MP from Shiv Sena party can sit in the opposition, said talks are going on to overcome the hurdles and his party will wait till Saturday for an honorable offer from the BJP before joining the government
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki yadi aisa nahin hua to party vipaksh main baithne kaa bhi faisla kar sakati he
 The three-day special session of the state assembly will begin from November 10 and Fadnavis will win a majority for his government on the last day

 The two leaders also held talks with each other after the ceremony

 But taking the Shiv Sena with 63 mlas is a better option for Fadnavis for long-term stability

 Despite Pakistan's terrorist actions, India is not ready to give up the attitude of lethargy

 There was no action in response to the attack and the strange silence was eased
 ek ke baad ek har pradhanmantri ke kaarykaal main hamale hote rahe or ham jakhm par vakt kaa maraham lagaate rahe
 Manmohan Singh has proved to be the weakest and most directionless among them
 unhone to mumbai aatankwaadi hamale ko bhula diya or baatcheet ko aatankwaadi karravaayiyon se alag karke cricket ke rishte phir kaayam kar liye
 He also forgot that the Mumbai attack is counted as one of the most unprecedented attacks globally
 jab bhi koi is baat par sawaal karata he ki har pakistani yaa chini hamale ke samay ham doosraa gaal kyon aage kar dete hai to sarkaar ke prachaarak javaabi sawaal daagate hai ki kya aap yuddh chaahate hai? tushtikaran ke himytiyon kaa yah bahut purana tark he ki tushtikaran nahin karne kaa matlab yuddh hota he
 Like the extremists, the advocates of appeasement also see the last end of the scope of the policy, that is, they are kneeling or fight openly
 isliye tushtikaran ke samarthakon ne bharat ke saamne vikalp rakhaa he—yaa to kaayarta se sehate raho yaa khule yuddh kaa jokhim uthaao
 This argument is unethical and unfair
 iskaa makasad tarksangat vikalpon par kisi bhi sarthak bahes ko shuru hone se pehle hi kuchal dena he
 There are hundreds of options between these two poles that India should consider
 sahi vikalp aisa hona chahie jisamen na tushtikaran ho na yuddh
 Proponents of appeasement also argue that neighbors cannot be changed

 Did Indira Gandhi not change political geography in 1971? The most important events in the latest history of the world are the partition of several countries including the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia

 iske baavjood manmohan singh neuyork main pakistani pradhanmantri se milane or beijing kii ek or yatra ke dauraan lagaataar aakraamak hote china ke darbar main salaam bajaane kii thaan chuke hai
 India has always suffered the brunt of the policy of spreading the arms to the opponents by continuously taking aggressive action
 thappad ke badale tali kii bharat kii niti kii isse badi misaal kya hogi ki april-may ke dauraan chini sena ke bhartiya seemaa main 19 kilometre bheetar tak ghus aane ko bharat ne ek maamuli ghatana bataaya or bhartiya sainikon kii hatya main pakistani sena kii bhoomika ko dhakne kii koshish kii
 In the US, that country is called an aggressor, who uses force against any other country without sufficient reason
 lekin bharat main aakraamak use kaha jaataa he jo belgaum yaa hathdharmi padosi ke saamne doosraa gaal badhaane ke khilaaf sirf salaah bhar detaa ho
 There is a lot of people in India who advise to increase the cheek and thus the image of India has become very soft country

 But India's politicians are so busy in their politics that they have no shame in breaking the facts of the martyrdom of the soldiers and suppressing the figures of Chinese incursions

 The reason for this is in one word: that is corruption
 behisaab bhrashtachar ne aisa rajnatik varg khadaa kar diya he jo desh ke hiton kii raksha karne main behad laachaar he
 The appeasement has grown so much that the Ministry of External Affairs has ceased to be just the Ministry of External Appeasement

 peshawar ucch nyaayalay kii do nyaayadhishon kii khandpeeth ne pasha ko phir se notice jari kiya or unase 20 july ko hajir hone ko kaha

 When the matter came up for hearing before the bench on Wednesday, an ISI official told the court that Pasha was busy investigating the suicide attack at the Data Durbar in Lahore and would appear in the court for the next hearing
 rabi ne isse pehle adaalat ko bataaya tha ki iesai ke karmiyon ne masjid ke ek maulavee ko reeha kar diya lekin use or nurul amin ko ‘utpeedan kendra‘ main rakhe rakhaa

 unhone kaha ki hamen samajhane kii jarurat he ki 2014 main bijepi ko jaisi jeet mili thi, uske mutabik vidhansabha chunaav main kyon nahin mili
 On the question of Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, Athawale said that there was a BJP government for the last 15 years, so the feeling of change in the people can be understood

 On the issue of farmers, unemployment and Dalits, he exhorted that the government should think and fulfill the promises made earlier in the few months left in the next general election

 in a website, a researcher named Meghnath s wrote on how the media did not properly report about this important bill related to the general public
 sansad kii reporting karne waalon ne bhi zaruri nahin samajha ki iske bare main logon tak soochna pahunchaai jaae
 Meghnath told an interesting story
 21 march ko jab vitt vidheyak par charchaa chal rahi thi, charchaa main shaamil kai dalon ke 9 saansad bol chuke the
 Till this time, no TV channel has considered it necessary to show any part of this discussion
 meghnath likhte hai ki jaise hi vitt vidheyak par hi bolne ke liye mukhyamantri adityanath yogi uthe, channelon ne us bhaashan ko dikhaanaa shuru kar diya
 At the time when he was speaking, information was going on in the bottom bar on Lok Sabha TV that the Finance Bill was being discussed
 mukhyamantri ne apane bhaashan kii shuruuaat hi is baat se kii ki adhyaksh ji main aapkaa abhaari hum, aapane mujhe vitt vidheyak par do shabd kehane kaa avasar pradaan kiya he
 But see his speech on the website of Lok Sabha too
 tabhi aap jaan paayenge ki unke bhaashan kaa koun sa hissaa vitt vidheyak ke praavdhaanon se sambandhit he
 i did not feel a single part, yet you should see it by yourself
 jis vishay par yogi ji ko bolnaa tha, us vishay par unhone kya bolaa isaki koi reporting nahin hui
 Before him, nine mps and after Yogi ji, six mps did not even speak on this
 us raat aap yaad karen tivi par yogi ji hi chaaye hue the
 The draft of Meghnath's article is how the media considered such a big issue less important than Yogi's speech
 is vitt vidheyak main kai sanshodhan aakiri vakt main pesh kiye gaye jinka sambandh raajnneetik chandon or unki paardarshita se he, tamaam vibhaagon ke vivaadon ke niptaare ke liye bane tribunel or unki niyukti prakriya se he
 Under this, the cash transaction has been reduced from three lakhs to two lakhs
 in sab par alag se charchaa honi chahie magar ham aaj ke vishay ko aadhaar se sambandhit hi rakhana chahenge
 With effect from July 1, 2017, it will be mandatory to fill Aadhaar number and provide Aadhaar number for PAN number
 bina aadhaar ke ab iskar ritern nahin bharaa ja sakegaa
 Anyone who has a PAN card will have to provide an Aadhaar number by July 1
 agar aisa nahin karenge to pan card avaidh ho jayega
 It is assumed that you do not have a PAN card or PAN number
 iskar farm or pan number main aadhaar ko anivaary kiye jane se kai sawaal phir se uthe hai
 Between 2009 and 2017, i heard many debates about the use of Aadhaar, the risk of it being leaked and mandated, read fifty articles
 duusari taraf hamane samaaj main dekha ki aadhaar ko lekar gazab kaa utsaah he
 Most political party workers are busy making Aadhaar card like voter ID card
 aksar kaha jaataa he ki isse hamaari aapaki privesi ko khatara he
 Remember, when you went to make an Aadhaar card, did anyone tell you how to handle it, whom to give, whom not to give, what would happen if it was leaked
 kya aapane poocha tha
 i may be wrong but you still have some questions
 kya aap privesi yani niztaa kaa matlab samajhate hai? kya aap samajhate hai ki isaki gopneeyata bani rahani chahie? kya aap samajhate hai ki aapaki har baat sarkaar jane? kya aap samajhate hai ki aapkaa aadhaar number privet companiyon ke paas bhi ho? kya aap jaanate hai ki aadhaar number li ho gaya to kya hoga?tippaniyan The danger to democracy is there even when there is no Aadhaar, after being Aadhaar, what kind of danger can you face after going to a political party, company, do you value this question? i think most of you are not bothered about Aadhaar at all
 tabhi to 112 karod bharatiyon ne puure utsaah ke saath aadhaar card banwaaya
 It is not that newspaper articles were not published about its criticism or danger
 tivi par kam hi sahi magar thodi bahut charchaa to hui he
 i would like to praise one of the critics for making Aadhaar mandatory
 ye tab bhi aalochana kar rahe the jab aadhaar kaa aagaman ho rahaa tha or ab bhi kar rahe hai jab sau karod se adhik bharatiyon ne aadhaar number le liye hai
 On the other hand, the government always seems confident about Aadhaar
 agar aalochakon kii baat main dam he to kyon nahin tamaam raajnneetik dal iske khilaaf bolte hai
 Why speak in Parliament itself
 sansad se baahar aapke bich aakar kyon nahin bolte hai
 One question is from ourselves and common people
 kya hamen pahchaan ke naam par koi bhi dastauez manovaigyanik suraksha detaa he or apni is suraksha ke liye ham wo suraksha bhi ganvaane ke liye taiyaar he jiskaa ahsaas hamen nahin he, kisi or ko he
 What do the Aadhaar numbers show to the citizens of this country with multiple identity cards like PAN card, ration card driving license, caste certificate, birth certificate, voter ID card, etc
 supreme court ne kai baar kaha he ki aadhaar ko anivaary nahin banaaya janaa chahie
 But the government is going to include it in all schemes in the form of cough syrup
 pension, scolership, ipiefo, rashan card, driving license, mobile number, mid de mil, pan number, iskar ritern, zamin kareed bikri
 Is corruption really over where Aadhaar has reached? upie jab isaki tarif kar rahi thi tab bijepi ise janata se kiya ja rahaa dhokhaa bataa rahi thi
 Now the BJP is making it compulsory in many things, so the Congress is taking the risk of base within the House
 driving license, mobile number, pan card, iskar ritern sabamein aadhaar anivaary he
 Meghnath writes that as soon as Chief Minister Adityanath Yogi woke up to speak on the Finance Bill itself, the channels started showing that speech
 jis vakt bol rahe the usee vakt loksabhaa tivi par neeche kii pattee main soochna chal rahi thi ki vitt vidheyak par charchaa chal rahi he
 The Chief Minister started his speech by saying that i am thankful to you, Mr
 President, you have given me an opportunity to say two words on the Finance Bill
 lekin unke bhaashan ko aap bhi loksabhaa kii website par jaakar dekhiye
 Only then will you know which part of his speech is related to the provisions of the Finance Bill
 mujhe to ek bhi hissaa nahin laga phir bhi aapako khud se bhi dekhnaa chahie
 There was no reporting of what he said on the subject on which Yogi ji was supposed to speak
 unase pehle nau saansad or yogi ji ke baad chah saansadon ne bolaa is par bhi nahin hui
 That night, you should remember that Yogi ji was on TV
 meghnath ke lekh kaa masauda yahi he ki media ne aakhir kaise itane bade masale ko yogi ji ke bhaashan se kam mahatvapurn samajha
 a number of amendments to this Finance Bill were introduced at the last minute which are related to political donations and their transparency, the tribunal for settlement of disputes of all departments and their appointment process
 isi ke tahat nagdi len dein ko teen lakh se ghataakar do lakh kar diya gaya he
 All these should be discussed separately but we would like to keep today's topic related to Aadhaar
 ek july 2017 se iskar ritern bharne or pan number ke liye aadhaar number dena anivaary ho jayega
 Income tax returns will no longer be filed without Aadhaar
 jis kisi ke paas pan card he use ek july tak aadhaar number dena hoga
 If you do not do this then the PAN card will become invalid
 mana jayega ki aapke paas pan card yaa pan number nahin he
 Many questions have been raised again with Aadhaar being made mandatory in income tax form and PAN number
 2009 se lekar 2017 ke bich aadhaar ke istamaal ko lekar, iske li hone se lekar anivaary kiye jane ke khatare ko lekar kai bahasein suni, pachaason lekh padhe
 On the other hand we have seen in society that there is a lot of enthusiasm about the base
 zyaadaatar raajnneetik dal ke kaaryakarta aadhaar card ko matadaata pahchaan patr kii tarah banavaane main jute rahete hai
 It is often said that this threatens your privacy
 yaad kiijie, jab aap aadhaar card banane gaye tab kya kisi ne aapako bataaya tha ki ise kaise sambhaal kar rakhana he, kise dena he kise nahin dena he, agar yah li ho gaya to kya hoga
 Did you ask main galat ho saktaa hum magar phir bhi aapse kuch sawaal hai
 Do you understand the meaning of privacy? Do you think its privacy should be maintained? Do you think that the government knows everything about you? Do you think that your Aadhaar number is also with private companies? Do you know what will happen if the Aadhaar number is leaked? loktantr ko khatara to tab bhi he jab aadhaar nahin he, aadhaar hone ke baad isaki soochna kisi raajnneetik dal, company ke paas jane ke baad aapako kis tarah kaa khatara ho saktaa he kya aap is sawaal ko mahatv dete hai? mujhe lagata he aadhaar ko lekar aapmen se zyaadaatar bilkul pareshaan nahin hai
 That's why 112 crore Indians made Aadhaar cards with full enthusiasm
 aisa nahin ki isaki aalochana yaa khatre ko lekar akhabaaron main lekh nahin chape
 There is hardly any discussion on TV but rightly
 aadhaar ko anivaary banaaye jane ke aalochakon kii ek baat ke liye tarif karnaa chahta hum
 They were criticizing even when the arrival of Aadhaar was coming and are still doing it when more than one hundred crore Indians have taken Aadhaar numbers
 duusari taraf sarkaar hameshaa aadhaar ko lekar aashwast nazar aati he
 If critics have a point, then why do not all political parties speak against it
 sansad main hi kyon bolte hai
 Why don't you come out of Parliament and speak among you
 ek sawaal khud se or aam logon se he
 Do any documents give us psychological protection in the name of identity and for this security we are ready to lose the security which we do not realize, someone else has
 pan card, rashan card driving license, jati pramaan patr, janm pramaan patr ,matadaata pahchaan patr aadi ityadi pahachaanon ke anek patron vaale is desh ke nagarikon ko aadhaar number main aisa kya dikhaa
 The Supreme Court has said many times that Aadhaar should not be made mandatory
 magar sarkaar ise kaph syrup ke rup main tamaam yojanaon main shaamil karti ja rahi he
 Pension, Scholarship, EPFO, Ration Card, Driving License, Mobile Number, Midday Mill, PAN Number, Income Tax Return, Land Purchase Sale
 kya vaaki jahaan jahaan aadhaar pahunchaa he vahaan vahaan se bhrashtachar khatm hua he
 When the UPA was praising it, the BJP was describing it as being a hoax to the public
 ab bijepi ise kai chizon main anivaary kar rahi he to sadan ke bheetar congress aadhaar ke khatare uthaa rahi he
 Aadhar is mandatory in driving license, mobile number, PAN card, income tax return
 is vitt vidheyak main kai sanshodhan aakiri vakt main pesh kiye gaye jinka sambandh raajnneetik chandon or unki paardarshita se he, tamaam vibhaagon ke vivaadon ke niptaare ke liye bane tribunel or unki niyukti prakriya se he

 Now the BJP is making it compulsory in many things, so the Congress is taking the risk of base within the House
 driving license, mobile number, pan card, iskar ritern sabamein aadhaar anivaary he
 With effect from July 1, 2017, it will be mandatory to fill Aadhaar number and provide Aadhaar number for PAN number
 bina aadhaar ke ab iskar ritern nahin bharaa ja sakegaa
 Anyone who has a PAN card will have to provide an Aadhaar number by July 1
 agar aisa nahin karenge to pan card avaidh ho jayega
 It is assumed that you do not have a PAN card or PAN number
 iskar farm or pan number main aadhaar ko anivaary kiye jane se kai sawaal phir se uthe hai
 Between 2009 and 2017, i heard many debates about the use of Aadhaar, the risk of it being leaked and mandated, read fifty articles
 duusari taraf hamane samaaj main dekha ki aadhaar ko lekar gazab kaa utsaah he
 Most political party workers are busy making Aadhaar card like voter ID card
 aksar kaha jaataa he ki isse hamaari aapaki privesi ko khatara he
 Remember, when you went to make an Aadhaar card, did anyone tell you how to handle it, whom to give, whom not to give, what would happen if it was leaked
 kya aapane poocha tha
 i may be wrong but you still have some questions
 kya aap privesi yani niztaa kaa matlab samajhate hai? kya aap samajhate hai ki isaki gopneeyata bani rahani chahie? kya aap samajhate hai ki aapaki har baat sarkaar jane? kya aap samajhate hai ki aapkaa aadhaar number privet companiyon ke paas bhi ho? kya aap jaanate hai ki aadhaar number li ho gaya to kya hoga?tippaniyan The danger to democracy is there even when there is no Aadhaar, after being Aadhaar, what kind of danger can you face after going to a political party, company, do you value this question? i think most of you are not bothered about Aadhaar at all
 tabhi to 112 karod bharatiyon ne puure utsaah ke saath aadhaar card banwaaya
 It is not that newspaper articles were not published about its criticism or danger
 tivi par kam hi sahi magar thodi bahut charchaa to hui he
 i would like to praise one of the critics for making Aadhaar mandatory
 ye tab bhi aalochana kar rahe the jab aadhaar kaa aagaman ho rahaa tha or ab bhi kar rahe hai jab sau karod se adhik bharatiyon ne aadhaar number le liye hai
 On the other hand, the government always seems confident about Aadhaar
 agar aalochakon kii baat main dam he to kyon nahin tamaam raajnneetik dal iske khilaaf bolte hai
 Why speak in Parliament itself
 sansad se baahar aapke bich aakar kyon nahin bolte hai
 One question is from ourselves and common people
 kya hamen pahchaan ke naam par koi bhi dastauez manovaigyanik suraksha detaa he or apni is suraksha ke liye ham wo suraksha bhi ganvaane ke liye taiyaar he jiskaa ahsaas hamen nahin he, kisi or ko he
 What do the Aadhaar numbers show to the citizens of this country with multiple identity cards like PAN card, ration card driving license, caste certificate, birth certificate, voter ID card, etc
 supreme court ne kai baar kaha he ki aadhaar ko anivaary nahin banaaya janaa chahie
 But the government is going to include it in all schemes in the form of cough syrup
 pension, scolership, ipiefo, rashan card, driving license, mobile number, mid de mil, pan number, iskar ritern, zamin kareed bikri
 Is corruption really over where Aadhaar has reached? upie jab isaki tarif kar rahi thi tab bijepi ise janata se kiya ja rahaa dhokhaa bataa rahi thi
 Now the BJP is making it compulsory in many things, so the Congress is taking the risk of base within the House
 driving license, mobile number, pan card, iskar ritern sabamein aadhaar anivaary he
 Many questions have been raised again with Aadhaar being made mandatory in income tax form and PAN number
 2009 se lekar 2017 ke bich aadhaar ke istamaal ko lekar, iske li hone se lekar anivaary kiye jane ke khatare ko lekar kai bahasein suni, pachaason lekh padhe
 On the other hand we have seen in society that there is a lot of enthusiasm about the base
 zyaadaatar raajnneetik dal ke kaaryakarta aadhaar card ko matadaata pahchaan patr kii tarah banavaane main jute rahete hai
 It is often said that this threatens your privacy
 yaad kiijie, jab aap aadhaar card banane gaye tab kya kisi ne aapako bataaya tha ki ise kaise sambhaal kar rakhana he, kise dena he kise nahin dena he, agar yah li ho gaya to kya hoga
 Did you ask main galat ho saktaa hum magar phir bhi aapse kuch sawaal hai
 Do you understand the meaning of privacy? Do you think its privacy should be maintained? Do you think that the government knows everything about you? Do you think that your Aadhaar number is also with private companies? Do you know what will happen if the Aadhaar number is leaked? loktantr ko khatara to tab bhi he jab aadhaar nahin he, aadhaar hone ke baad isaki soochna kisi raajnneetik dal, company ke paas jane ke baad aapako kis tarah kaa khatara ho saktaa he kya aap is sawaal ko mahatv dete hai? mujhe lagata he aadhaar ko lekar aapmen se zyaadaatar bilkul pareshaan nahin hai
 That's why 112 crore Indians made Aadhaar cards with full enthusiasm
 aisa nahin ki isaki aalochana yaa khatre ko lekar akhabaaron main lekh nahin chape
 There is hardly any discussion on TV but rightly
 aadhaar ko anivaary banaaye jane ke aalochakon kii ek baat ke liye tarif karnaa chahta hum
 They were criticizing even when the arrival of Aadhaar was coming and are still doing it when more than one hundred crore Indians have taken Aadhaar numbers
 duusari taraf sarkaar hameshaa aadhaar ko lekar aashwast nazar aati he
 If critics have a point, then why do not all political parties speak against it
 sansad main hi kyon bolte hai
 Why don't you come out of Parliament and speak among you
 ek sawaal khud se or aam logon se he
 Do any documents give us psychological protection in the name of identity and for this security we are ready to lose the security which we do not realize, someone else has

 pulavama main jaish ke aatanki hamale main abtak CRPF ke 37 jawan shahid ho chuke hai
 Even after two and a half years, that terrorist attack of Uri is enough to bring blood to the eyes of India
 us kyrana hamale ne hindustan ko hilaa diya tha
 Now it was echoed that for how long Hindustan would keep watching the sacrifices of its soldiers
 tab hamaare jambaajon ne pioke main sargical strike par aatankwaad kaa fan kuchalane kaa daawa kiya tha
 But by targeting a convoy of two and a half thousand soldiers in Pulwama, Jaish carried out a bigger terrorist attack than Uri and now the enemies of the country once again invited Surgical Strike Part-2
 pulavama hamale par purv sena pramukh general bikram singh ne kaha ki is hamale ke peeche pakistan kaa haath he
 First of all, the areas in Jammu and Kashmir where our army is stationed should be reviewed
 jis ranneeti ko aatanki apana rahe hai, usko dhyaan main rakhte hue planning kerani padegi
 Apart from this, the army has a lot of plans to give a befitting reply to Pakistan
 sarkaar jaanati he ki kab or kaise iskaa jawaab dena he
 There are many options such as surgical strikes
 bhavulpur ke andar jo jaish-e-mohammad kaa mukhyalay he, vahaan par strike kii ja sakati he
 There may be action on their training camp, launch pad
 general bikram singh ne kaha ki ab sarkaar ko tay karnaa he ki vah kaise karrwai karegi
 Especially in view of the election, how will Pakistan give a befitting reply
 piem modi or unke saathi mantriyon ke bayaan se lagata he ki karrwai hogi
 Action may not happen immediately, as Pakistan will be alert this time
 hamen intjaar karnaa padegaa yah karrwai karne ke liye
 He said that if we put more pressure on the people, then it can also have a bad effect
 oparation bahut soch samajhakar chalaanaa padataa he, taaki aatanki bhi maare jaae or avam ke upar fark na pade
 Defense expert Major General (retd
) GD Bakshi said that Pakistan's military does not understand diplomatic and economic considerations
 hamen pakistan se usee bhashaa main baat kerani hogi, jo bhashaa use samaj aati he
 It is the language of power, which has not yet been used properly
 jab sargical strike hui to ham log khush the
 We expected to have at least 5-6 strikes, but after the first surgical strike a long full stop was put and started celebrating
 hamen ek baar phir pakistan ke khilaaf badi karrwai kerani hogi, taaki use dard ho
 Meanwhile, if we take a big action, then Pakistan, which is struggling with financial crisis, will break

 History of Jaish - On September 18, 2016, Uri carried out a terrorist attack in Uri in which 19 soldiers were martyred
 - usase pehle jaish-e-mohammad ne 2 janvari 2016 main punjab ke pathankot sthit vaayu sena thikaane par aatanki vaadi hamalaa kiya jisamen 7 jawan shahid hue or ek aadmi maaraa gaya
 Jaish was also responsible for the attack on Parliament on 13 December 2001, in which 9 people died
 - usee saal 1 oktober ko jammu or kashmir vidhansabha par jaish ne hi aatankwaadi hamalaa kiya tha jisamen 38 logon kii jaan gai thi
 The time for the surgical strike which was raging across the world, now that the government should expand it
 vaise pradhanmantri narendra modi kah chuke hai ki javaanon kaa ye balidaan vyarth nahin jayega
 Then this time there should be a direct surgical strike on the Jaish

 purv vidhayak pandurang barora ne is babat shahpur thane main daroda kii gumshudagi kii report darj karai thi
 Meanwhile, Daroda's son Karan told the media that he had not been able to get any contact with his father since Saturday morning
 karan se apane pita se apil kii he ki unhensharad pawarka hi paksh lenaa chahie
 (with Sahil Joshi's input) nae 'bhagoda aarthik apradhi kanoon' ke tahatvijay maalyaki shanivaar ko mumbai kii ek vishesh adaalat main peshi soochibaddh (listed) kii gai he
 This is the first action taken against a fugitive accused under this new law
 maamle main sutron kaa kahana he ki yah to pakkaa he ki somvaar ko maalya adaalat main pesh nahin hoga, kyonki vah landan main bharat dwaara pratyrpan (extradition) ke liye daayar kiya gaya mukadmaa lard rahaa he
 However, it is expected that a legal representative on behalf of Mallya will present the reply in the court of Special PMLA Judge MS Azmi on this notice
 isi adaalat ne 30 june komalyako yah notice jari kiya tha ki vah 27 agast ko pesh ho, kyonki pravartan nideshaalay (ED) ne sharaab kaarobaari maalya ko nae kanoon ke tahat aaropee banaaya tha
 Along with this, he had extended the money laundering investigation against him and others in the alleged bank fraud case of nine thousand crore rupees
 is CBI ne apni naveenatam karrwai ke tahat maalya kii 12 hajaar paanch sau karod rupee kii sampatti tatkaal jabt karne kii bhi maang kii thi
 According to sources, the next step as legal action under the Fugitive Economic Offenses Act depends entirely on the court's decision
 samachar agency bhashaa ke mutabik isse pehle sutron ne sanket diya tha ki agar maalya adaalat main pesh nahin hota he, to uski sampatti jabt kiye jane ke aadesh jari hone ke alaava us par bhagoda aarthik apradhi ghoshit kiye jane kaa bhi khatra mandara rahaa he
 The same court had issued a non-bailable warrant against Mallya in two other ED cases
 adhikariyon ne nae kanoon ke tahat arji lagaate hue adaalat ko bataaya tha ki maalya or uske kingfisher airlines or anya ne vibhinn bainkon se karj liya tha or philhal uske khilaaf byaaj samet 9,990 karod rupee se zyada kii rakam bakaayaa he
 The ED and CBI have filed alleged debt payment violation cases against him

 He can be declared a fugitive economic offender and his assets can be confiscated

 bada intjaar tha ki pichley hafte supreme court main centre sarkaar algebiticu samudaay ke liye apana kya najariya pesh karti he
 In recent years, there has been a strong movement from political parties seeking support for the LGBTQ community
 kuch hi partiyon ne sakaaratmak jawaab diya
 The Congress, JD (S), National Conference, AAP and CPI (M) made public statements in favor of this community
 aap or makapa ne to apane ghoshnaptr main aparaadh kii shrenee se mukt karaane kii uski maang ko bhi jagah di
 However the NDA government remained silent
 11 july ko uskaa maun tutaa to jarur lekin uskaa rukh pehali najar main or bade maun jaisaa hi laga
 Then, when a demand for a little more clarification arose, it became clear that the party actually had an idea about it
 haalanki vah katai vaisaa nahin he jaisaa algebiticu samudaay barabari ke vyavhaar kaa adhikaar paane kaa sapana dekhtaa he
 On July 11, Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the Constitution Bench of the five judges of the Supreme Court, hearing the Section 377 case, that the Center would favor the court's views in the matter
 yah us sarkaar kaa rukh to nahin ho saktaa, jo gaiyr-apradheekaran ke paksh main ho
 The endorsement is said to be when the government would submit an affidavit to eradicate the atrocities on LGBTQ community and to give them equal rights
 yah to vahi hua, jo 2012 main upie sarkaar ne kiya tha
 The then Attorney General Late Ghulam Vahanvati had said in the court that the government had learned a lot from the Delhi High Court's decision of the Naz Foundation and was in favor of repealing Section 377
 vaahnavati yaheen nahin ruke, unhone yah bhi kaha ki yah kanoon aupniveshik raaj main yonik samrajyavad kaa pratik he or dhara 377 bharat kii sahishnu parampara or mulyon ke anuroop nahin he
 Later, when the Supreme Court ruled in the Center v
 Suresh Kumar Kaushal case, the Central Government filed a review petition
 lekin samiksha yachika par faisla ulataa aayaa to usne is kanoon ko khatm karne ke liye kadam nahin uthaae
 Despite this, the then government had shown at least a clean and deliberate attitude
 iske vipareet maujuuda atirikt solicytor general sirf itane par hi nahin ruke ki is maamle main sarkaar kaa koi rukh nahin he
 He told the court multiple times that he had some apprehensions
 lekin pataa yah chalaa ki ye ashankaayen vah nahin thim jisase es
 K
 kaushal kii galtiyaan doharaai ja sakati thim
 Instead, the government wanted that if the court wants to give relief, then also add a note of caution to it that there is a danger of increasing adultery and bestiality
 is maamle main pashaviktaa kii baat to khaskar betuki he, kisi bhi maukey par kisi yachikakarta ne yah daleel nahin di or atirikt solicytor general kii yah gaiyr-jaruri 'chintaa' sirf adaalat ko yachikakartaon kii daleel se bhatka hi sakati he
 Not only this, the Additional Solicitor General during the cross-examination of the petitioners continued to talk Tokataki or complaining that the relief they are seeking from the court does not come under the purview of the petition
 yahaan tak ki tushaar mehta yachikakartaon kii sanvaidhanik daleelon kii praasangikta par bhi sawaal uthaate rahe
 He particularly expressed apprehensions and objected to the arguments on the right to form organizations of the LGBTQ community
 lihaaja, kai baar unhen adaalat se jhidki sunani padi
 However, the courts can only pronounce the verdict, but the state's active role is required to execute it
 is maamle main agar adaalat sahmati se sansarg karne vaale vayaskon par dhara 377 ke lagu na hone kaa faisla suna detii he (or is tarah algebiticu logon ko aapraadhik dhaaraon se mukti dilaa de) to yah nishchit rup se ek kadam aage kii baat hogi
 But after this, the second role will be that of the state or government to implement the decision with utmost seriousness and stop the hold of the people of the community
 phir, rajya ko dhara 377 main sanshodhan bhi karnaa padegaa
 Therefore, a number of doubts arise from the current stand of the government
 bhale vah khulkar kuch nahin kahana chaahati, magar uskaa rukh algebiticu samudaay ke haq main to nahin dikhataa
 Therefore, at the moment, it seems that even if the Supreme Court gives its verdict in favor of the community, then it will remain entangled in the government's indifference
 is berukhi se bhi badhkar yah baat he ki sarkaar supreme court main sirf maun nahin he, vah tikhi daleelein bhi de rahi he or uski daleelon kaa har shabd is samudaay kii avmaananaa kii tarah hi he

 Warne wrote in his column in the Daily Telegraph, 'test cricket is very important for me and many other former players
 yah ab bhi sarvshereshth praaroop he or hamen ise badhaava dene or aakraamak style kii cricket khilne kii jarurat he
 'he said,' There were many things going on about the Test Championship and nothing happened
 test cricket duniya bhar ke prashansakon kaa dhyaan khinche iske liye isamen nai jaan foonkane kii jarurat he
 The veteran spinner of his time said, "it is still important in Australia, England and India but in other countries its condition is bad and it is a matter of concern
" yadi ham sajag nahin rahe to iske parinaam bure honge or yah jald hi dam tod degaa
 "it will be a big tragedy and the International Cricket Council and Cricket Australia should take the lead to save it and ask the players what should be done to save it," Warne said
