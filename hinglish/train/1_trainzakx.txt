 Bigg Boss 13 is getting a bang drama these days
 weekend kaa waar main salmaan khan ne sabake saamne arhan khan ko benakaab kiya
 After the truth of Arhan Khan was revealed, there has been a stir among the fans including the contestants of Bigg Boss
 lekin iskaa sabase zyada asar rashmi desai par hua
 Rashmi Rai, who trusts Arhaan with closed eyes, is broken knowing such a big truth about her marriage and child
 sho main rashmi foot-footkar royee
 Seeing Rashmi broken, Salman Khan will go to Bigg Boss house and handle them and explain them
 arhan khan kii sachai jaanakar rashmi kaa brakedown dekhakar phans kaaphi niraash hai or rashmi ke liye apana dukh jaahir kar rahe hai
 Fans are strongly supporting Rashmi on social media and are asking her to stay strong
 rashmi ke phans soshal media par # staystrongrashamidesai trend kara rahe hai
 Fans are also very happy to reveal the truth of Salman Khan's Arhaan and the fans are thanking Salman Khan for doing so
 rashmi ke saport main saamne aae phans-ek yujar ne rashmi ko saport karte hue likhaa- aaj mujhe samaj aayaa ki salmaan khan hameshaa rashmi ko kyon daantate or samajhaate hai
 Salman said that he only explains to those who are capable of understanding
 aaj salmaan khan ek host nahin balki ek bhai the, jo har ladki kii care karte hai
 Salman wants to save Rashmi's life
 Today i understand why Salman always used to bash and guide Rashami
 Cause he told woh unko hi samjhate hai jo samajhne layak hai
 And today he was no a host he was a brother who cared for a girl whom he has known since many years ans trying to save her life
 # staystrongrashami — Rashami for BB13 💞 (@rashamiholic) December 7, 2019 Thank you @ beingsalmankhanfor whatever you did today

 (@ivibhatweedy)december 7, 2019 Thankfully for the social media which gave at least a face as well to the UP police
 ye camere kii karaamaat hi thi ki ham sabane upi police kii thany-thany se lekar tagabag-tagabag sab kuch dekh liya
 But somewhere it seemed that there was still something missing
 to lijie ye kami bhi upi police ke ek daroga sahab ne puri kar di
 Daroga sahab wearing a uniform, shooting himself on his own camera, in the pride of his senior police officer, what is the dialogue that you are going to hear, if you do not hear that
 upi police ke hud-hud dabang daroga sachin dayaal choudhary kaa video khub viral ho rahaa he or uskaa ye dialog bhi
 The inspector says that if he falls in front of me, i will shoot straight from the government pistol
 yani ek baat to saaf he ki muradabad police kaa ye daroga on da spot faisla karata he
 Now it is known that whose appointment will you bring
 to suniye upi police kaa ye daroga kisi chor uchakke yaa badmaash ko nahin dhamka rahaa he
 Rather, he is directly threatening his boss CO
 yaa to meraa transfar kar do yaa sio kaa
 Otherwise i will shoot straight
 to dhamkee saaf he
 That too in the name of a policeman
 batch sako to batch lo
 Otherwise, you will shoot directly
 anjaam kii parvaah nahin
 Because mlas, mps and Ministers are in their pocket
 upi police ke dijipi se bhi inaki sidhe ram ram he
 Dabangg Daroga ji is stating that there are mlas mps and Ministers in his house
 or soobe ke dijipi opi sharma se unki sidhi baatcheet he
 Well, just correct a dialog
 upi police ke dijipi opi sharma nahin balki opi singh sahab hai
 However, tell me what happened to your senior officer and CO Devendra Yadav who are intent on shooting them directly from the government pistol
 daroga ji ne baat shuru kii
 He is originally a resident of Meerut
 ji ham sun rahe hai
 First, spit out the pan masala
 ham to aapaki baat sunne ke liye hi baithe hi hai
 Yes say now masala thookte hue daroga ji video main bataa rahe hai ki kal subah ek choti si baat ho gai
 7
45 in the morning at 68 seconds
 to suna aapane
 This outspoken Daboga of Moradabad played him in the clock
 jo ghadi banane vaala bhi nahin baja paaya
 7
45 minutes and 68 seconds
 ji daroga ji yahi bataa rahe hai ki kal subah ek choti si baat ho gai
 7
45 in the morning at 68 seconds
 ab aap hi bataaen
 Can any man in the world play 68 with a second needle in a clock? nahin naa
 That is why they say
 
 Which cannot happen anywhere
 jo koi nahin kar saktaa
 She does UP police
 khayr
 
 daroga ji aap apni kahani jari rakhie, ham sun rahe hai
 Mr
 Daroga started the story
 "main apni nijee gaadi se ja rahaa tha
 The carriage number is HR26S7788
 "are phir se kahaan chal die
 This pan masala is troubling a lot
 ek kaam kiijie ugaldaan rakh lijie
 The trouble of getting up and spitting again and again will be over
 yaa phir gutkha chhod hi dijie
 Not a good habit
 khayr aage bataaie
 Now the officer said - My car stopped
 kuch dikkat thi, gaadi ne back maar diya or sio sahab kii gaadi aa rahi thi, unase lard gai
 good
 
 But outside the Moradabad police line you were saying
 ulte sio sahab ne aapaki gaadi ko takkar maar di thi
 You said that at 7
45 am and 48 seconds, the CO had hit my car
 are abhi to daroga sahab aap kah rahe the ki aapaki gaadi galati se sio sahab kii gaadi se takaraa gai thi
 And now you are saying that CO sir hit your car
 khayr jane dijie aap kahani jari rakhie
 Yes, you were saying that your car accidentally crashed into co's car
 phir
 
 daroga ji kehete hai "maine haath jod pair pakade royaa
 Apologized "can't understand why you spit and eat spit
 khayr aage bataaie
 According to the officer, the officer told him what is your son's name
 acha to sarkari pistal se sidhe goli maarane kii kahani ye he
 But your statements are twisting slightly
 ek camere ke saamne to aap dhamkee dete hai
 And in front of the other camera you become merry
 asal main to hua ye tha ki ye daroga sahab apni personal gaadi se muradabad kii police line main gum rahe the
 And while backing the car, his vehicle collided with the official vehicle of his senior police officer CO Devendra Yadav
 or phir daroga ji apane senior se hi bhid gaye
 Daroga ji says that he was about to drop his hands on me
 wo shaayad mujhe goli maar dete
 When asked, what was the matter, Majesty? zaraa clear to kiijie
 What do you want 
 The Either make me posting
 yaa unki kar do
 
 varanaa mujhase kahen ki betaa chhod de jane de
 That means the sir will apologize
 to daroga ji unhen maaf karne ko taiyaar hai
 Then there will be no risk of the sir eating a direct pill
 lekin agar sio sahab ne maafee nahin maangi to aap jaanate hin hai
 mlas, mps, Ministers and even DGP of UP Police are in the pocket of Daroga ji
 upi police ke dijipi se mulaakaat to khayr aapaki ho hi jaaegi
 After all, it is a matter of home
 magar aapaki mulaakaat ho to hamen bhi bataaiega
 We are all desperate to know that there is no shortage of DGP for your sake

 The pilot said in Jaipur on Wednesday that the way some incidents have happened in the state, they should not have happened
 kanoon-vyavastha hamaari jimmedaari he
 The pilot's point was towards Alwar's Behror jailbreak scandal
 unhone kaha ki alvar main jis tarah se jailbrake hua yaa phir duusari jagah par ghatnaayen hui hai, yah nahin honi chahie thim
 Our priority should be that our mothers and daughters should be safe and the government should focus on this
 sachin payalat se jab poocha gaya ki kya mukhyamantri ashok gahalot khud rajya main grih mantri kii bhoomika main hai, aise main part time grih mantri hone kii vajah se kanoon-vyavastha bighad gai he, to is par unhone koi coment nahin kiya
 He said that we have to focus on improving the law and order

 payalat ne iskaa jawaab dete hue kaha tha ki bahut logon ko bahut kshetra main anubhav hota he or kai tarah kii jimmedaariyon ke saath anubhav bhi ho jaataa he
 Let me tell you that Sachin Pilot is going to meet Congress President Sonia Gandhi in Delhi on Thursday and in such a situation, it is being said that the Congress president can be informed about the state of the state there too

 Pilot said that the law should be made for the convenience and benefit of the people and not to cause problems
 jab ek baar gujarat sarkaar ne bhi kah diya he ki jurmaana zyada he or vah jurmaana kam karegi, tab yah baat kisi party yaa kisi sarkaar kii nahin rah jaati he
 It becomes a matter of everyone

 He appealed to the state government to reconsider this
 udhar, rajasthan ke parivahan mantri pratap singh khachariyavaas ne saaf kar diya he ki nayaa motor whical act ko hu-ba-hu rajasthan main lagu nahin karenge
 Fines will be reduced in Rajasthan and will be reduced more than what has been reduced in Gujarat
 jisaki aamadani ₹5 hajaar he usase ₹15 hajaar or tees hajaar kaa jurmaana lene kaa koi matlab nahin he
 We will consider this soon and take a decision to give relief to people

 katha is tarah he
 
 
 Once Ravana pleased Lord Shankar by doing severe penance
 shankar ne ravan se var maangane ko kaha
 Ravana expressed his desire to establish Shivalinga in his city
 shankaraji ne ravan kii baat maan lee, lekin unhone iske saath ek shart jod di
 Shivji told Ravana, 'don't keep the shivaling anywhere on the way, otherwise i will be established at the same place
 'balabhimani ravan shivlinga ko lekar kailahpuri se lanka kii ore chalaa
 Seeing Ravana, all the gods of Devaloka got worried
 unhone sochaa ki agar ravan kaa kaary siddh ho gaya, to vah amartv paa legaa
 All the Gods together consulted and discovered its cut
 idhar ravan ko achnaak jor se laghushanka (peshaab) lagi
 When he could not tolerate the urge of miniature, he gave the shivalinga to a Brahmin and instructed him not to place it anywhere
 daivayog se ravan kii laghushanka itani der tak hoti rahi ki brahman shivlinga ko thamkar thak gaya or use jameen par rakhkar chalaa gaya
 Later Ravana tried to lift Shivalinga from there, but could not lift Shivalinga
 antat: ravan ne usee jagah par shivlinga kii puja-archana kii

 unhone kaha ki bharat main hajaaron kii sankhya memrohingyaahain, rohingyaon ko unke desh to waapas janaa hoga
 However, we also have to see that if they are still at risk there, do not do so
 rohingyaon kii samasya kaaphi badi he, bharat ise sulajhane main ahm role nibhaa saktaa he
 Guterres said that much work is yet to be done in those places (myanmar), but slowly the right Rohingyas will have to return to their areas

 He said that terrorism is a very important issue, it is a matter of concern not only in this area but also at the global level

 Countries have to resolve this issue among themselves, but it seems that the countries are not ready for this

 For almost three months, the Samajwadi Party (SP) leadership has been performing aarti to bring rebel leader Mohammad Azam Khan back to the party, but Khan is reluctant to believe
 ve apni sari sharten manwaane ke liye party supremeo mulaayam singh yadav ko blackmel kar rahe hai
 The sp's political activities are almost at a standstill and the entire Yadav family, led by the party's leader and Mulayam, is busy celebrating Azam Khan, who is guzzling him constantly
 unhen party virdohi gatividhiyon ke chalate may 2009 main baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya tha
 The condition is that on 22 November, when Mulayam himself and his supporters announced that Azam Khan would return to the party, on the occasion of Mulayam's 72nd birthday, he postponed his intention
 us din mulaayam dilli main hi rukkar ajam khan ke party main lautne kaa intjaar karte rahe
 To please the Muslim leader, Mulayam went to such an extent that he also removed his younger brother Shivpal Yadav from the post of Leader of Opposition in the Assembly and offered to give him this responsibility, but Azam Khan has just 'look and wait' Is indicated
 mulaayam ne muslim voton ko lubhaane ke liye 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main ek tarah se unhen mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar ke rup main pesh karne kaa man banaaya he
 Azam Khan is being considered as the 'weakness' of the SP supremo, as his position in the state is continuously getting weaker
 pehle unhen vidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaavon main jhatka laga tha or uske baad haal ke 28 upachunaavon main bhi adhikansh siten basapa ke khate main gai hai
 The SP could win only four of them
 is saal november main jin do siton par upachunaav hue hai, un par sapa ne maatr apana kabja hi barkaraar rakhaa he
 It won both the Lakhimpur and Nidhauli Kalan, (etah) seats in the 2007 assembly elections
 haalanki in do upachunaav main basapa maidan ke baahar hi thi
 After the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the SP leadership felt that it would incur heavy electoral losses if the Muslims pulled out of the SP for embracing former BJP veteran Kalyan Singh, who is considered 'responsible for the demolition of Babri Masjid'
 Was lying
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main sapa ke tikat par koi musalmaan jeet nahin paaya tha
 On the other hand, four BSP Muslim candidates won, leaving Mulayam a setback
 unhen ehsaas ho gaya ki musalmaan unase dur ja sakate hai, jabaki yadavon ke saath musalmaan hi sapa kaa bada aadhaar hai
 To regain the trust of the minority community, the SP chief quickly devised a new strategy
 unhone pehla kadam yah uthaaya ki 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke turant baad bemuravvati se kalyaan or unke bete ko apane kheme se bedakhal kar diya
 He then publicly apologized unconditionally for joining hands with Kalyan
 phir, unhone apane rajnatik bhavishya ke liye mullaon kii dua maangi
 He was seen on many occasions and in many cities on stage taking blessings from mullahs wearing big beards and round teepee
 ek tarah se yah muslim samudaay ko sandesh tha ki kalyaan singh se haath milaane ke rup main kiye gaye 'aparaadh' ke liye majahabi rahanumaon kii ore se maaf kar dene ke baad musalmaan unka saath den
 After this, Mulayam secretly got involved in trying to return his old trusted member Azam Khan
 darasal, ajam khan sapa main party ke purv mahasachiv amar singh ke badhate prabhutv ke chalate naaraaz the
 At the time of the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Azam Khan and Amar Singh openly clashed with Jayaprada's candidacy, but Mulayam finally announced Jayaprada's candidature by vetoing Amar's favor
 chunaav ke dauraan jayprada ke virodhiyon ne unke rampur kshetra kii deevaaron ko atyant aapattijanak postaron se paat diya tha
 Despite this, she was not encouraged and she won the election
 baad main, ajam khan ne saarvajanik rup se mulaayam or amar singh ko bhala-bura kaha tha
 He was suspended from the party at the end of the election phase
 shuru main, mulaayam singh ko apane dost se dushman bane ajam khan se kisi sakaaratmak jawaab kii ummid nahin thi
 So he entrusted this responsibility to his old friend and businessman Madhukar Jaitley, who helped narrow the gap between these two senior leaders
 bataate hai ki thodi hichak ke baad ajam khan sapa main lautne ko taiyaar ho gaye, par unhone kuch sharten rakhin
 They want him to be given some important responsibility like the post of Leader of the Opposition, get ticket-sharing rights in the 2012 assembly elections and do not obstruct his agenda for Muslim welfare
 ajam khan ke jor dene par sapa ne unki ore se kisi tarah kaa afsos jataae bina ekatarfa hi unka nilamban radd kar diya
 This is the reason that when some Muslim mlas objected to Azam Khan's return, party spokesperson and Mulayam's brother Ram Gopal Yadav served a notice to him, bringing all the voices of protest to a standstill
 party ke varisht netaa shivpal bhi ajam khan kii vaapasi se khush nahin hai, magar ve chup hai
 In fact, Mulayam knows that the 2012 assembly elections are nothing short of a battle for his political existence
 congress jis tarah se ubhar rahi he or saadhe teen saal satta main rahane ke baavjood basapa ke khilaaf satta virdohi maahaul nahin he, aise main mulaayam ko apane muslim-yadav janaadhar kii darkaar he
 Kneeling in front of Azam Khan, the SP chief is making another big political mistake
 yah sahi he ki ajam khan muslim cheharaa hai, prakhar vaktaa hai or apane samudaay kii bhaawanaaon ko ubhaarne main bhi maahir hai, par ve din babari masjid-ayodhya masale ke thanda padane ke saath hi lad gaye hai
 In his last term as a minister in the Mulayam government, Azam Khan's image has been of a highly arrogant and far-flung minister and he has also failed to keep Muslims from the SP
 iske alaava, ajam khan or sapa ke netaa ek-duusare ko khuleam is kadar bhala-bura kah chuke hai ki unki vishwasaneeyata kam hi hui he
 Take Kalyan Singh only
 unhen ek baar bhaajapa se barkhaast kiya gaya tha or 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle unhen party main dobaaraa shaamil kar liya gaya, magar bhaajapa ko baari chunavi nuksaan uthaanaa padaa kyonki kalyaan na to vaisaa sammaan paa sake or na hi karishma dikhaa sake jaisaa unhone ram janmabhumi andolan ke dinon main kar dikhaaya tha
 Azam Khan's political stature is not the same as welfare, but both have faced similar situations and their withdrawal has proved to be a burden for their parties
 iske alaava mulaayam is tathy ko bhul rahe hai ki yadi kalyaan kii vajah se musalmaan sapa se dur hue the to unke samarthan ke kaaran hi pashchimi uttar pradesh main sapa ummidavaar bhaajapa ko haraa sake the kyonki vahaan badi sankhya main lodh vot hai
 If Mulayam feels that he can win the 2012 assembly elections by presenting Azam Khan as the Chief Ministerial candidate, then his opponents will try to weaken him without provoking Azam Khan's provocative statement, even though Azam Khan is making this statement Denials
 mulaayam ko pataa hona chahie ki musalamaanon main hi nahin, yadavon main bhi unki vishwasaneeyata ghati he
 Muslims feel that the party leadership has always deceived them, because the important posts of the party and the big posts in power have been available only to the Yadavs
 udhar, yadavon ko lagata he ki party main sirf ek yadav vansh kaa raaj he or isamen ve mahaj ek mohara hai
 Mulayam had nominated the state president of the party and his son Akhilesh's wife for the Lok Sabha by-election in Firozabad, but the Yadavs won the Congress candidate Raj Babbar there
 yah mulaayam ke liye karaara jhatka tha or tab puure pradesh main sandesh gaya tha ki yadav vansh ke log bhi chunaav haar sakate hai
 However, instead of just wooing Azam Khan, Mulayam should also focus on other weak areas and analyze rigorously to formulate a strong strategy
 yadi ve ajam khan ko lubhaa sakate hai to puraane naaraaz doston benny prasad verma, raaj babbar or amar singh kii ore dosti kaa haath kyon nahin badha sakate, jo apni kamajoriyon ke baavjood sapa ko uttar pradesh main ek badi takat banane main madadgaar rahe
 And if Mulayam feels that Azam Khan will dissuade him from this storm, then only time will tell whether he is right or wrong
 sarkaar or nyaaypalika ke bich badhate tanaav ke bich pakistan kii supreme court ne pradhanmantri usoof raja gilaani ko ultimatum dete hue unhen raashtrapati ke khilaaf rishwat ke maamalon ko phir se khulwaane ke sambandh main ‘tatkaal’ swiss prashasan ko patr likhane kaa aadesh diya he
 a seven-judge bench headed by Judge Naseer ul Mulk said Gilani should write a letter to the Swiss administration without waiting for the advice of his legal experts
 peeth ne iske saath hi gilaani ko 21 march ko agali sunwaayee ko adaalat ko uthaae gaye kadamon kii jaankaree ke sambandh main report saunpane ko bhi kaha he
 Pakistan's Attorney General Maulvi Anwarul Haq has been instructed to inform the Prime Minister of 'immediate' Supreme Court directives
 rishwat ke sambandh main aam maafee ko khaarij karne ke adaalat ke ek purv ke aadesh ke kriyanvayan ke sambandh main ek maamle kii sunwaayee karte hue peeth ne yah nirdesh diya
 President Asif Ali Zardari and more than eight thousand others benefited from this amnesty
 purv main pradhanmantri ne adaalat ko bataaya tha ki unke kanoonee salaahkaaron ne unhen salaah di he ki jaradaari ke khilaaf maamalon ko phir se nahin kholaa ja saktaa kyonki samvidhan raashtrapati ko chhot pradaan karata he
 The same seven-member bench had heard the contempt of court case against Geelani for failing to act on the court's order to reopen the cases against Zardari
 adalati kaarywahi ke baad gilaani ke vakil etjaj ahasan ne bataaya ki peeth ne pradhanmantri se 19 march tak vistrut bayaan saunpane yaa nijee rup se pesh hokar 21 march ko bayaan darj karaane ko kaha he
 Failing to do so will trigger a final debate
 avmaananaa maamle ke vakil or atarni general dwaara cabinet sachiv naragis sethi se bahes kiye jane ke baad peeth ne yah nirdesh jari kiya
 Sethi appeared in the court as a witness
 ahasan ne bataaya, ‘yadi gilaani bayaan dete hai to antim jirah 21 march se shuru ho jaaegi
 'in 2008, the Swiss administration closed the 60 million dollar money laundering case against Zardari on the appeal of the Government of Pakistan
 supreme court ne haal hi main jaradaari ke khilaaf maamle phir se khulwaane ke adaalat ke adeshon par karrwai karne se inkaar karne par gilaani ko adaalat kii avmaananaa maamle main abhyaaropit kiya tha
 The apex court has been pressuring the government to reopen the cases since December 2009

 According to the information, there was a discussion between the two about the latest political situation
 donon ke bich pehle se mulaakaat tay nahin thi, par shuukravaar raat ko achaanak jithan ram maanjhi nitish se milane ke liye patna ke 7, circular road sthit unke awaas par ja pahunche
 On Thursday, CM Manjhi had given a statement that he has remained the Chief Minister for a few days
 is lihaaj se yah mulaakaat kaaphi ahm samajhi ja rahi he
 Actually, the political situation of the state is changing rapidly
 nitish kumaar ne jo sochakar jithan ram maanjhi ko mukhyamantri banaaya tha, us lakshya ko paane main ve bhale hi safal rahe hon, par ab donon ke bich lagaataar dooriyaan badhati hi ja rahi hai
 Jitan Ram Manjhi did not take Nitish Kumar's opinion not only in everyday work but also in many important matters
 isse nitish itane naaraaz ho gaye ki unhone maanjhi se baatcheet band kar di
 The situation deteriorated so much that when Nitish Kumar called JDU ministers and office bearers at his home, he did not invite Manjhi
 isse mantriyon main yahi sanket gaya ki maanjhi ab nitish kumaar ke priy paatr nahin rah gaye hai
 General elections in Bihar will be held in 2015
 nitish kumaar maanjhi ko hataakar mahadaliton ko naaraaz nahin karnaa chaahate
 But it looks like they will take a big decision
 nitish kumaar ke saamne bijepi kii badi chunauti he or vah jatvaad ke sahare usase takkar lenaa chaahate hai
 But removing Manjhi may shock him in his campaign
 vaise is baat kii sambhaavna badhati ja rahi he ki jithan ram maanjhi jaldi hi kursi chhod denge
 He himself has given these hints and said that he is the Chief Minister for a few days
 ab agar maanjhi yah mahatvapurn pad chhod dete hai, to jediu supremeo nitish kumaar ke liye badi samasya khadi ho jaaegi, kyonki unhone maanjhi ko mukhyamantri bihar ke mahadaliton ko khush karne ke liye banaaya tha
 Manjhi has always been surrounded by controversies
 ve kai baar aise bayaan dete rahe hai, jisase vivaad khadaa ho jaataa he
 Sometimes they also do some such things, which increases Nitish Kumar's displeasure
 pichley dinon nitish kumaar unase is baat ke liye naaraaz ho gaye ki unhone apane damaad ko apana pie or bhattije ko chaparasi bana rakhaa tha
 After the case opened, he removed the son-in-law from that post
 baharhaal, bihar kii siyasat dhire-dhire or ubaal khaati najar aa rahi he

 world) onmay 3, 2017 at 10:07 am PDT Let us tell you that virat-anushka had reached Uttarakhand to celebrate New Year and Christmas at the beginning of the year when there was a rumor that both of them are engaged
 haalanki viraat ne isapar safai di thi ki donon jab bhi aisa kuch nirnay lenge, sabko zarur bataaenge
 Municipal Corporation of Delhi elections have been held
 ab 26 april ko nattejey aaenge, lekin isse pehle aae agsit pole aam aadmi party ke liye acchhee khabar nahin laae
 MCD exit polls after the punjab-goa assembly elections are also disappointing for the AAP
 2 saal pehle prachand jeet ke saath dilli main sarkaar banane vaali aam aadmi party ke liye emsidi chunaav khaas ahmiyat rakhte hai
 The results of the elections will be seen directly related to the work done by AAP in Delhi
 lekin pehle punjab or goa vidhansabha chunaavon ke nattejey or phir baad main aae emsidi ke agsit pole darsha rahe hai ki 'aap' kaa wo jaadu gaayab ho rahaa he, jiske dam par usne dilli main 70 main se 67 siton par jeet darj kii thi
 The graph falling continuously in the elections shows that the land of Kejriwal is slipping in Delhi
 kejariwal or unki party kaa wo jaadu gaayab ho gaya he, jo 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke samay yaa usase pehle tha
 In the MCD elections too, he attacked the BJP, Lt
 Governor and EVM more, not talking about his work done in the last 2 years
 pichley 2 saalon main aam aadmi party ne kai aise faisle liye yaa unke liye halaat bane, jiske kaaran uski dilli main jameen kamjor hoti gai
 1) Repeatedly going out of Delhi AAP party contested 5 years Kejriwal's slogan in 2015 assembly elections
 lekin iske baad bhi aam aadmi party ne punjab or goa main chunaav ladaa, jo ki unke khilaaf gaya
 In Punjab, the party sought votes only in the name of Kejriwal
 punjab chunaav ke dauraan kai baar ye bhi sandesh gaya ki kejariwal dilli chhodkar punjab kii kaman sambhaal lenge
 During this period, the dominance of AAP continued to decrease in Delhi
 iske saath hi party se dilli ke rajouri garden se vidhayak janrail singh istipha dekar punjab chunaav main ladane chale gaye
 Janrail Singh also lost elections in Punjab and the party lost one seat in Delhi
 yahaan hue upachunaav ko bijepi ne jeet liya, jabakitaaf tisare numberpar rahi
 2) Don't live up to the promises The Aam Aadmi Party took power in Delhi in 2015 with big promises
 lekin sarkaar banane ke saath se hi party kii ye chhavi banane lagi ki wo vaade puure karne main samarth nahin he
 The Delhi government has repeatedly accused the central government of stalling for not fulfilling its promises
 is daleel par dilli kii janata ne kam hi bharosa kiya
 Not being able to fulfill promises like wi-fi, CCTV cameras created a negative image of the government
 3) mantriyon par aropadilli main sarkaar banane ke saath hi 'aap' sarkaar ke mantriyon par bhrashtachar or tarah-tarah ke aarope lagane lage
 If a government minister was surrounded on a fake degree, someone got trapped in a sex CD
 mantriyon se lekar netaaon tak par aise gambhir aarope lage ki unamem se kai jail bhi gaye
 In the report of Shunglu Committee, corruption and nepotism spread in the Kejriwal government came before the people
 4) modi ko lagaataar target karnadilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne piem modi par vyaktigat hamale karne kaa koi mauka nahin choda
 While crossing the border several times, Kejriwal also made objectionable remarks on Modi
 kejariwal ke in hamalon par modi ne kabhi palatwaar nahin kiya
 Kejriwal targeted Modi at a time when Modi's popularity is steadily increasing
 modi ke alaava kejariwal uparajyapal ko bhi nishaanaa banane ke liye lagaataar khabaron main rahe
 5) The removal of big leaders: The Aam Aadmi Party showed the way out to the leaders of big and clean image like Yogendra Yadav, Prashant Bhushan and Anand Kumar, who had been with them since the time of the movement
 in netaaon ne bhi baahar hote hi party ke khilaaf bolnaa shuru kar diya, jisase party kii nakaaratmak chhavi bani
 Apart from this, the big and popular face of the party, Kumar Vishwas kept distance from the leaders even while in the party
 kai maukon par to kumaar vishwaas ne sarkaar or kejariwal kii aalochana bhi kii
 In the MCD elections, Kumar Vishwas did not even campaign for the party

 New captain Virat Kohli decided not to play Cheteshwar Pujara in this match, while in bowling, he replaced Varun Aaron in place of Bhuvneshwar Kumar
 pujaara kii andekhi kii shaayad hi kisi ne kalpana kii ho
 Pujara, who was being called the new wall of Team India in place of Rahul Dravid, did not find a place in the Test team as the No
 3 batsman
 vah bhi tab jab pujaara county cricket main thik thaak pradarshan karke laute the
 Pujara scored 264 runs in four county matches at an average of over 52, including a century
 baavjood iske kohli or shastri ne rohit sharma par kahin zyada bharosa kiya, jabaki australia main bhi test maichon main pujaara ne rohit kii tulana main zyada ran banaae the
 Pujara scored 201 runs in 3 Tests on Australian tour, while Rohit Sharma scored 173 runs in 3 Tests
 tippaniyan Despite Pujara's fine performance and his ability to play spin bowling, ignoring him raises many questions about Kohli's strategy
 unke bhavishya ko lekar bhi chintaaen jataai ja rahi hai
 It is true that Rohit Sharma's claim is also not weak, but according to technique in Test matches, Pujara still needs Team India and that too as the number 3 batsman
 rohit ko test main number 5 ke ballebaaz ke taur aajamaaya ja saktaa he
 Cheteshwar Pujara has scored 2073 runs in 48 innings of 27 Tests
 unka adhiktam score 206 ran naabad he
 Hardly anyone imagined Pujara being ignored
 pujaara, jinhen rahul dravid kii jagah team india kii nai diwaar kaha ja rahaa tha, unhen test team main number 3 ballebaaz ke taur par jagah hi nahin mili
 That too when Pujara returned after performing well in county cricket
 pujaara ne chaar county maichon main 52 se zyada kii ausat se 264 ran banaae, jinamein ek shatak bhi shaamil tha
 Despite this, Kohli and Shastri relied more on Rohit Sharma, while in Australia too, Pujara had scored more runs than Rohit in Test matches

 The comments pujaara ke thikthak pradarshan or spin gendbaazi khilne main unki kaabiliyat ke baavjood unako nazarandaaj karnaa kohli kii ranneeti par kai sawaal paidaa karata he
 Concerns are also being raised about his future
 ye sahi he ki rohit sharma kaa daawa bhi kamjor nahin he, lekin test maichon main takanic ke hisaab se abhi bhi pujaara kii jarurat team india ko he or wo bhi number 3 ballebaaz ke taur par

 Aankhon Dekhi Hanging Writer: Girijashankar Publisher: Article Publication, New Delhi Price: Rs 495
 pustak sarayah kitaab raipur jail main 25 aktubar, 1978 koek hatyare ko di gai faansee kii sajaa kii reporting or maut kii sajaa se jude itihaas ke ird-gird buni gai he
 Now let's take the name, we are going 
 
 bas hamaar ladkan kaa dikhaa do
 
 
 "this was the reaction when Rambhrosa alias Bharosa alias Baiju, who murdered four people in the greed of transistors and similar things, was being sent to the hanging of Raipur Central Jail
" ek nirakshar adivasee maut kii sajaa se thik pehle panditji ke baar-baar kehane ke baavjood ram kaa naam lene ko raji nahin he
 He never went out of his tribal area of surguja, but even after the President has approved his death sentence, he repeatedly urges him to call the Mullah Lawyer of Allahabad, he will save him from hanging
 darasal baiju vakil anand narayan mullah kii baat kar rahaa tha jo baad main ol india cameti on jail riforms (1980-83) ke chairman bane
 When the jail people ask him repeatedly that he has to meet a relative before he dies, he remains silent but when the hanging noose comes, he pleads to meet his sons
 hatprabh jail adhikari poochhate hai ki itane din se tumse poocha ja rahaa he ki kisi rishtedaar se milanaa he, tab tumne kaha nahin or ab faansee saamne he to ladakon se milane kii baat kah rahe ho
 Baiju's answer to this puts the language of the judicial system in the dock, "you were saying to call relatives, where did you say to call sons?" '' or faansee se thik pehle jab mujrim ke haath peeth ke peeche rassi se bandhe hai, tab jail adheekshak kaa use apane haath se cigarette ke kash lagavaana or khud bhi cigarette pinaa
 These are cases of death sentence which are not found in films or literature
 chunki is kitaab ke lekhak girijashankar koi sahityakar nahin balki patrkaar hai or faansee par chadhane vaala koi kaalpanik paatr nahin sachmuch kaa hatyara he, so puure ghatnakram kaa sapaat varnan mumkin hota he
 In general, flatbay brings a negative sound, but the specialty of this book is that whenever the author does not try to add something on his behalf, then the most emotional description of this inevitable human tragedy begins to happen automatically
 chunki kitaab sarkari anumati ke baad faansee kii ghatana kii aadhikarik reporting par kendrit he, so lekhak ne kaidi ke faansee ke fande kii ore badhane ke varnan ke bich main aitihaasik or kanoonee prakriyaaon ko bhi bun diya he
 These things of academic importance break the narrative but prove to be helpful in building an overall understanding of the subject
 khaskar aaj jab tivi or netaa jor-shor se balaatkaariyon ko nrushans mrityudand dene kii baat karne lage hai, yah kitaab ishaara karti he ki ye pratigaami vichaar hai
 Civilizations have civilized themselves in punishing thousands of years of development, and its basic purpose is to stop crime, not to draw eye for eye
 haa, ek baat or gangram putale kaa zikr isamen aapako khaasaa dilachasp lagegaa
 This is the effigy on which the rehearsal of the execution takes place before being hanged
 kitaab main aisi kai baarikiyaan bade dilachasp dhang se ai hai
 There was a discussion in the Lok Sabha to pass the historic GST bill
 isi bich number aayaa sapa supremeo mulaayam singh yadav kaa
 In the beginning, Mulayam said that the GST bill will be passed
 bas iske baad mulaayam ne apni line length hi badal lee
 Then other things came out from Mulayam's speech, Mulayam said that GST is fine, but the House should bring a law for the poor, no poor should starve, no poor or farmer should commit suicide, a law should be made by consensus
 sabhi chaunke ki aakhir jiesti par charchaa main mulaayam singh ye kya baaten karne lage
 Everyone was shocked, but Mulayam is a keen political player
 thodi hi der main saafe ho gaya ki mulaayam apana dard bayaan karne kii bhoomika bana rahe the
 Yes, there was a pain of defeat in UP, which Mulayam wanted to make a statement
 mulaayam bole, hamaari sarkaar ne jo vaayade kiye sabhi puure kiye
 Mulayam reminded the promise of free education to free medicine
 uske baad mulaayam bol hi gaye ki saare vaade puure karne ke baavjood ham chunaav haar gaye
 Mulayam did not stop here, then Raman Deka, sitting on the chair, reminded that the discussion is happening on GST
 mulaayam phir bole ki wo to paas ho jaayegaa, lekin upi main apane kiye saare vaade puure karne ke baavjood bhi ham chunaav haar gaye, vahaan bhi 'modi modi, jai modi jai modi' ho gaya
 They won the election by making false promises and won with such a majority, which the BJP people themselves would not have expected
 apane bhaashan main mulaayambijapi koyaad dilaanaa nahin bhuule ki upi kii janata palatnaa bhi jaanati he
 He said, 'in 1977, when you and we were together, a majority came, but in 80 the public turned around
 isliye aapane jhuthe vaade kiye hai or wo puure nahin honge, to janata hisaab kar degi
 'overall, the discussion in Lok Sabha was on TOST, but Mulayam was facing the defeat of UP, then all the pain came on the tongue
 ab to poochne vaale puuchhenge hi ki, akhilesh se kitna bhi manmutav rahaa ho, lekin akhilesh sarkaar kii haar kaa dard jab mulaayam ko pareshaan kar rahaa he, to chunaav ke vaqt parivaar main jo hua kya wo vaaki family drama tha

 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi has once reached the public to win the battle of Gujarat
 gujarat navasrujan yatra ke tisare charan main rahul kaa focus south gujarat he
 Also on his agenda is to finalize the support of the young trio
 iske liye party ke andar charchaa ke saath taiyaari bhi joro par he
 Rahul had shared the stage with OBC leader Alpesh Thakor on his last Gujarat visit
 is dauraan alpesh ne aadhikarik taur par congress kaa daaman tham liya tha
 After this, efforts to address Patidar leader Hardik Patel and Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani intensified
 congress ke pradesh netaaon ne ek taraf jahaan patidaaron se gujarat main meeting kii
 At the same time, in-charge of Gujarat, Ashok Gehlot after initial talks brought Jignesh Mevani to Delhi to join Rahul Gandhi
 haalanki, mevani rahul se milane nahin pahunche
 After which Rahul reached Gujarat as part of his proposed tour on Wednesday
 rahul kii ye yatra 3 november tak chalegi
 On the last day of the visit, Rahul will address a huge public meeting in Surat
 party sutron ke maane to congress ke liye ye din kaaphi ahm hone vaala he
 According to the senior party leader, "if the conversation that is going on is successful, then there will be a shocking view at the Surat rally"
 kya manch par aaenge hardik or mevani?congress sutron ke in daavon se sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya surat kii raily main hardik patel or jignesh mevani rahul gandhi ke saath manch saajha kar aadhikarik taur par congress ko samarthan kaa elaan karenge? darasal, alpesh thakor ke baad congress jald se jald hardik patel or jignesh mevani kaa samarthan hasil karnaa chaahati he
 There are many reasons behind this
 pehali ye ki congress hardik ko saath laakar patidaaron ke bijepi ke saath jane ke raste band karne kii koshish karnaa chaahati he
 Because recently it has also been reported that Ashwin Patel, National Convenor of Patidar Reservation Sangharsh Samiti is in touch with BJP
 unka maananaa he ki congress ke bajaay bijepi patidaaron kii sharton ko puraa karne main sakasham he
 The second reason is that Congress wants to start consultations on ticket distribution by bringing Hardik and Jignesh together
 iske liye haalanki party kii screening cameti ne meeting bulaai he, jisamen tikaton par charchaa honi he
 Interestingly, the screening committee meeting is also scheduled to be held on November 3, which will be held for the next two days
 vasava se bhi charchayuva tikdi ke alaava congress jediu netaa chotubhai vasava ko bhi apane 'grand alliance' kaa hissaa banane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Congress General Secretary Ashok Gehlot has already held several rounds of meetings with Vasava
 party sutron kaa kahana he ki agar gathbandhan ho jaataa he to vasava ke saath milakar congress ko kai siton par phayda pahunchane kii ummid he
 Overall, the period of discussion and meetings from Gandhinagar to Delhi is hot
 patidaaron kii chaar badi maangon par congress sahmati jataa chuki he
 Now the Congress has to clarify its stand on reservation, for which Hardik Patel has granted them till November 7
 aise main ab dekhnaa ye hoga ki kya rahul kii surat raily se pehle hi congress hardik patel, jignesh mevani or chotubhai vasava ke saath deal pakki kar legi
 If this happens, it is possible that someone will be seen in Rahul's Surat rally

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Mamta Banerjee said sternly, "there is no opposition
" ham khud apana vipaksh hai
 He looked around on the stage with disinterested and cursory eyes, where the leaders of his party were sitting with their heads bowed to avoid eyeing him
 mamata kii chetavaniyaan jari raheen, ''main jaanati hum, koun kya kar rahaa he or koun kiske sampark main he
 i will not allow anyone to be wired to maa-mati-manush (the slogan of Trinamool Congress)
 ''bengal main gaddinshin trinmul congress (tiemasi) haal ke dinon main khaasi uthal-puthal se gujri he
 Around a dozen political murders have taken place and in every case the finger has been pointed towards the internal battle of the party
 phir party chhodie waalon kaa tantaa lag gaya he
 Just two months before the Lok Sabha elections, two party mps switched sides
 bhaajapa main shaamil ho gaye purv tiemasi saansad mukul raay apni puraani party main send lagane kii muhim main jute hai
 But Mamta's courage has not diminished
 unhone apane siyaasi safar main isse kahin zyada badi pareshaaniyon kaa saamana kiya he
 When another veteran leader of the party came to the BJP, he laughed loudly that now it is the responsibility of every TMC member to ensure the party's victory in all the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 mamata ne jor dekar kaha ki party ko vot dene kaa matlab he khud unhen vot dena or 'sampradayik dangaiyon (narendra) modi-(amit) shah kii party' yani bhaajapa kaa muqabla karne ke liye unke haath majboot karnaa
 His list of Lok Sabha candidates includes film stars and 21 defectors from other parties, apart from one or two novices
 mukhyamantri jaanati hai ki party main uthal-puthal hogi, par ve aatmavishvaas se bhari hai
 That's why he said, "whoever wants to go is free to go
" mujhe parvaah nahin he, ve jane ke liye aaazaad hai
 
 
 "three years ago, just before the 2016 assembly elections, when she was facing all-round challenges and the names of her party's candidates were appearing in the Saradha and Narada scandals, Mamata appealed to the people
" , '' Mamta Banerjee is the candidate for all 294 seats
 sabhi 294 siton par main ummidavaar hum or main guzarish karti hum ki mujhe vot den
 The party won 219 seats in that election
 ab loksabhaa kii sabhi 42 siten jeetne kii baari he, taaki mamata rashtriya raajnneeti main apni jagah surakshit kar saken or pradhanmantri kii kursi ke najadik aa saken
 This is the reason why Mamata is giving this election a new twist — this is a 'do or die' election for the state for the first Bengali Prime Minister in the country, "this is not a minor election battle

 "party members have also created a new Facebook page -" Chaulo Badlai, a Bengali pradhan Montri Chai
 '' bengal do baar mauka chook gaya he—1991 main pranab mukherjee or 1997 main jyoti basu pradhanmantri pad se chook gaye the
 Although Mamat is describing herself as merely 'LIP' (less important person) in all the stalwarts involved in the race for the post of Prime Minister, people of her party are using the Prime Minister's card to mobilize the voters of the state
 bengali asmita banaam hindutwabhajapa purab main vibhinn rajyon main rashtriya naagarikta register (enarasi) or naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak kii himaayat karke hindu voton ko golband karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 At the same time, Mamta did not lose time in creating a Bengali Narrative by emphasizing linguistic and regional identity instead of religion
 ve har jansabha main bataati hai ki kis tarah ''bengali upanaamon vaale naam, hindu or musalmaan donon, nikaal die gaye hai
 This is nothing but the ethnic cleansing of the Bengali movement in the name of NRC
 '' yah bayaanbaji tab or tej ho gai jab assam jal uthaa tathaa khabar ai ki purvottar main enarasi ko lekar bengali bolne vaale 'bahari' khudakushi kar rahe hai
 At the same time, Mamata and her party leaders are calling the BJP as 'outsider', that is, a party which is basically a Hindipeet party and who does not know the culture, tradition and language of the state
 bhaajapa ko apane kaaryakramon ke liye kendriya mukhyalay se apane rashtriya netaaon ko laana padaa, party ke paas rajya kaa koi pramukh bengali cheharaa nahin he, is sabko rajya kaa apmaan bataakar dhol peeta gaya
 Even the bjp's demand to declare all booths in Bengal to be hypersensitive, drew strong criticism from Mamata
 bhaajapa ne jab mamata par muslim tushtikaran ke aarope lagaae, tab shuruyaat main mukhyamantri thodi chintit thim
 He read Hindu mantras at rallies and also announced development works at Hindu pilgrimage sites like Gangasagar, Tarapith, Dakshineswar and Kalighat
 panditon-purohiton ke liye bhatte kaa bhi elaan kiya gaya
 Says Vishwanath Chakraborty, professor of political science at Ravindra Bharti University, "but soon he realized that the support of hardline Hindus cannot be gained by the tactics of Khairait
 isliye ve apane muslim vot bank ko hi pukhta karne kii koshish kar rahi hai
 His response after the Pulwama and Balakot air strikes was cautious and nosy

 Before the 2017 assembly elections, Rahul Gandhi has asked the leaders of UP to create a similar atmosphere against the SP government over the corruption in the Bundelkhand package, as he had done before the 2012 Assembly elections in protest against the NRHM scam in UP
 Was framed against the government

 Later, the same leaders said that he had brought computers and telecommunications to India
 unhone kaha ki usee tarah, paanch-das saal baad, ve kahenge ki naregaa or artiai unka srijan hai
 Rahul wondered how the opposition BJP said that the Congress which did 60 years can do it in just three months
 congress upaadhyaksh ne sawaal kiya ki vipaksh kahata he ki jo congress ne 60 saal main kiya ve teen maheene main kar denge
 How is this possible? He said that it is the hard work of the poor that has taken the country forward and no one person can take credit for development

 Just got to see something like this some time ago
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri shahid khakaan abbasi ne neuyork sthit ek thinkatank ko 21 sitambar ko bataaya ki unke desh ne ''bharat ke ''cold start" siddhant ke jawaab main kam duuri vaale ranneetik parmaanu hathiyaar viksit kar liye hai
 "according to India's cold start doctrine, armored troops of India (mechanized infantry) can attack Pakistan in a few hours, not in the same manner as before
 cold start ke jawaab main pakistan kii ranneeti, jaisaa ki pradhanmantri abbasi ne bataaya he, 60 kimi kii duuri vaale parmaanu hathiyaaron se las ''nasya" (vijay) mixilon ko tainaat karne kii rahi he taaki pakistan kii jameen par kadam badhaane vaali bhartiya fouj ko nishaanaa banaaya ja sake
 On the other hand, Air Force Chief B

 IAF officials told India Today that in the event of war, "responding to Cold Start's response involves targeting 8x8 Chinese-origin transporter erector launchers (tels)
" donon kii hi yojanaon main apni samasyaayein hai
 Dozens of low-capacity nuclear warheads would be needed to intercept the offensive and, on the other hand, acting as a defensive umbrella in the air for the advancing army, the IAF would be forced to launch its nuclear weapons to the enemy's TEL before their targets
 Will need to be ascertained properly so that they can be destroyed in time
 chalate-phirte laancharon kaa sateek tareeke se pataa lagaana kathin hota he
 The 12-meter-long launchers weigh more than 25 tonnes and appear like a pile of logs on the ground
 isliye aasmaan se unamem fark karnaa bahut mushkil hota he
 More than 2,000 unsuccessful airstrikes were conducted by the us-led coalition forces in the 1991 Gulf War to locate and destroy 8 Iraqi 8 tel-bound Iraqi Scud missiles
 saddaam hossain ne in laancharon ko desh bhar main idhar-udhar failaa rakhaa tha
 Detecting and destroying Nasr can prove to be a very challenging task as the IAF does not currently have the capability of a platform like JSTARS-AWACS like the US, but its radars only monitor the movement and direction of vehicles on the ground
 
 yahaan tak ki jameen kii scanning karne vaale radar bhi nakli or asli laancharon (jaisaa ki saddaam ne tainaat kar rakhe the) main fark nahin kar sakate
 In view of this, the objective of the statement of the Air Force is probably to emphasize the government's choice of cold start
 isse jahaan jeestares kii kharid kaa nayaa daur shuru ho saktaa he, vahiin pakistan ke parmaanu hathiyaaron ko lekar chintaa ko khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The US shortened nuclear weapons and placed them in jeep rifles and cannons hitting for a few km, but it was removed as it could dramatically transform such a conflict into a larger war

 The Prime Minister also spoke on a question from Akshay Kumar about how tea helped him learn Hindi because Hindi of Gujaratis is often not good
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, 'jab main chaay bechata tha tab mujhe bahut kuch seekhney ko mila

 He always used to say that you are Gujju bhai then how do you speak such good Hindi

 unase baat karte karte hindi sikh gaya
 In the evening, the milkmen used to do bhajan kirtans and chaupaiyas in which i used to sit

 Narendra Modi further said, 'while becoming Prime Minister, perhaps and Prime Ministers have not got this benefit that i have got is that i have been the Chief Minister of Gujarat for so long and while in that position you have to work with nuances, issues They come directly in front of you and you also have to solve them directly

 Regarding his work, Prime Minister Modi said that 'every moment of life and every particle of the body is going to be engaged in any mission
 mere paas iske sivaay koi kaushal hi nahin he
 On a question related to social media, he told Akshay that 'I definitely see social media, it gives me information about what is going on outside

 First Dehradun, then Chakrata and then Uttarkashi, but in the meantime the two mysteriously disappear along the way
 donon ke mobile phone bhi achaanak band ho jate hai
 The question is, where did the two go missing? During the Diwali holidays, a couple came to roam here from Delhi, away from the hustle and bustle of the city
 shaam ho chali thi or donon ko is chote se toun main rahane ke liye koi kaayade kii jagah nahin mil rahi thi
 In such a situation, both of them first looked for a taxi to get out of here, but when this effort was also failed, they thought it better to sit in one person's taxi to get out of Chakrata
 ye taxi tiger fall, uttarkashi kii taraf ja rahi thi
 The taxi driver assured both of them to take him to Uttarkashi and said that he would also arrange for their stay at some place on the way, but something happened after that with Abhijeet and Moumita from Delhi, someone thinking about it Could not even
 maumita ke gharavaalon ne 29 oktober ko dilli ke saket police stesan main apni beti kii gumshudagi kii report likhavai
 The Delhi Police immediately started investigating and with this came to know a shocking thing
 abhijit or maumita donon ke mobile phone to pehle se hi band the, lekin hairaani bhare tareeke se in numberon se aakhri kol ek local number par kiya gaya tha
 Yes, a local number, whose phone was owned by Raju Das, but the police came to know when he found that Raju's mobile phone was also continuously locked since October 23
 tafteesh aage badi or jald hi ye pataa chalaa ki raju das koi or nahin, balki chakraata kaa hi ek taxi driver he
 Here, troubled by the disappearance of her daughter, Mumita's family members now reached Vikasnagar near Chakrata
 maumita ke gharavaalon or dilli police ke bataane par vikasnagar kii police ne 6 november ko raju das ko hiraasat main le liya, lekin donon kii talash main lage unke gharavaalon ko tab jhatka laga, jab unhen pataa chalaa ki taxi driver raju se koi khaas jaankaree nahin milane par police use poochtacha ke baad chhod diya
 Here, a team of Delhi Police investigating the case had reached Chakrata and Vikasnagar by then, but in the meantime, the first suspect in the case, the driver Raju Das, did an act that raised the ears of the police
 police ke changul se chhootane ke baad sabase pehle raju ne apana mobile on kiya or phir usamen ek nayaa sim card daal liya or bas, uski isi harakat ne ek baar phir se raju ko police kii radar par laa diya
 The person with whom Abhijeet and Moumita were last seen was once again in the custody of the police before they were exposed to the world, but this time one of his actions had caught him in the trap of law
 ab chakraata kaa taxi driver raju das ek baar phir se police ke kabje main tha
 Under the strictness of the police, Raju started narrating the whole story of a parrot
 usne bataaya ki kis tarah 22 oktukar kii shaam abhijit or maumita chakraata main kisi hotel kii talash kar rahe the or isi bich hotel naa milane par usne raju kii taxi main uttarkashi jane kaa faisalaa kiya
 However, after talking to Raju, when the two decide to find a little more hotel, Raju along with his friends get an opportunity to plot the robbery of both
 raju or uske teenon dost apni asaliyat par utar chuke the
 The two boys first caught Abhijeet and got down from the car, while two caught Mumita
 donon shor machaaya, chhodane kii guzarish kii, lekin donon kii chikh sunsaan or andheri vaadiyon main gum ho kar rah gai
 Now Abhijeet became restless after seeing Maumita's disgrace, he tried to get rid of the miscreants but in view of Abhijeet's protest, he pulled a rope from the car and strangled him on the side of the road and killed Abhijeet in front of Maumita's eyes
 Took it down
 maumita ab bhi jinda thi or wo ab bhi darindon se apni zindagi kii bheekh maang rahi thi, lekin kaanoon se bachane kii koshish main qaatilon ne uski bhi jaan le lee or naa sirf jaan lee, balki aisa karne se pehle ek ne uske saath balaatkaar bhi kiya
 Providing great relief to the UPA amid the situation arising out of withdrawal of support by the Trinamool Congress, the Samajwadi Party said it would continue its support to the government as it did not want 'communal powers to come to power'

 Published by Penguin
 yah pathakon ko aathvin shatabdi isa purv ke bharat main lekar jaataa he, jahaan jati or varnon kaa bantwaaraa samaaj ko uthal-puthal or yuddh kii taraf le gaya he
 An excerpt from Sandeep Nayyar's first novel Samarasiddha, this is also Kajal
 
 
 ’ ankhon ke neeche fail gaye kaajal ko ponchhate hue shatvari ne darpan main apane rup ko nihara
 The focus of the new youth is more than grooming its form
 poornima ke chand se gol chehre par chamakati badi-badi ankhon main laga kaajal, bhunhon ke bich lagi chatak laal bindi, patale raseele honton par saji surkhi, khule baalo main latakati mogare kii veni, kaanon main sone kii baaliyaan or gale main laal moti jadi sone kii maala, use apana rup kuch yun laga jaise phulon se dhaki kisi ghati main bani do jhiilon ke kinare kaali ghataaen utar ai hon
 "can it be done better than this?" The eighteen-year-old wheat-colored, medium-sized and slim-bodied Shatavari glued the silver girdle tied at the waist a little below the navel, and then smiled at her waist
 ‘oh, aditi kab se pratiksha kar rahi he
 To learn music from Pandit Achutha Acharya
 acharya ji samay ke paband hai
 Shatwari came out running, where Aditi was waiting for him sitting on a carriage of oxen
 ‘itnaa sajane kii bhi kya aavashyaktaa thi? sangeet seekhney acharya ji ke paas janaa he, kisi gandharva ke paas nahin,’ shatvari ko dekh aditi ne kataaksh kiya
 "do you know if there is a sight of a Gandharva on the way," said Shatwari blinking
 buggy ke aakaar kii baiylgaadee main aditi kii bagal main baithte hue shatvari ne gaadiwan ko chalane kaa sanket kiya
 'don't you have to go to Pandit Achyut Acharya's house?' The cartman asked while hauling the oxen
 haa, ve hamen sangeet sikhaate hai
 Shatwari said, while handling the pink dupatta that came from the bodice without arms
 apane main vah aisi magn thi ki apni bahon ko dupattey se dhaknaa bhi bhalu gai thi
 'you are very lucky that Acharya ji is teaching you music
 puure rajya main unke jaisaa sangeet kaa gyani koi or nahin he,’ belon kii lagaam ko kuch kasate hue gaadiwan ne kaha
 'yes, he is an old friend of my father Pandit Aditya Shastri
 isiilie hamen sangeet sikhaa rahe hai
 Otherwise it is not so easy to become his disciple
 ’apni bahon ko dupattey se dhakte hue shatvari ne kuch upar chadh ai reshmi cholii ko neeche sarakaaya
 'shastri ji is respected throughout the village
 unke jaisaa vidwaan or veda-shastron kaa gyaata milanaa bhi kathin hi he
 Shatwari was pleased to hear the praise of her father through the mouth of the trainman
 garv kii sinduri abha uske chehre par damak ai
 'carmen
 
 
 ’ shatvari kaa sambodhan puraa hone se pehle hi gaadiwan ne kaha, ‘meraa naam gunjan he
 Gunjan was a young man of almost twenty years of dark complexion
 uskaa sharir ikharaa kintu gathila tha
 His long face, with a light beard on it, was quite attractive
 kandhon tak aate kaale baalo ko usne sanvaar kar peeche kii ore baandha hua tha, jisase uskaa bada or ubhara hua mastak puraa dikhaai de rahaa tha
 He wore a white dhoti tied at the waist and a part of it was also put on the upper part of the body
 gale main kaale dhaage kii ek maala thi jisamen chaandi kaa ek sikaa piroyaa hua tha
 Small earrings of silver were worn in the ears
 ‘vaah! gunjan! tumhaare to naam main hi sangeet he,’ shatvari ne hansate hue kaha
 Then he introduced himself and said, 'my name is Shatwari, and this is my friend Aditi
 ’phir thodi der rukate hue shatvari ne poocha, ‘gunjan tumhen sangeet aata he?’ ‘sangeet to vedon kii parampara he
 i am a Shudra
 main bhala kahaan se sangeet sikhuunga?’ gunjan ke chehre par maayusi kii ek halki parat ubhar ai
 'music is a tradition of breaths, not of the Vedas
 sangeet jaanane ke liye vedon kaa gyaan sahaayak to ho saktaa he, parantu aavashyak nahin he
 The music is also in the cuckoo's cuckoo and bhangra's hum
 ’ ‘aap thik hi kahati hai
 i have no knowledge of sargam and raga-ragini, but i have also learned to sing a little while singing baramasi and phag with friends
 hamaare tole ke sheetala mandir ke pujari bansuri bahut acchhee bajaate hai
 He has also taught me to play the flute, 'gunjan said while enumerating some of his interests
 maayusi kii parat ko hataati ek mithi muskaan uske chehre par fail gai
 'oh wow, then you tell us a song
 dekhen to sahi tum kaisaa gaate ho
 This way the path will also be cut, 'said Aditi, jumping into the conversation of Shatwari and Gunjan
 aditi ke is aakasmik anurodh se gunjan kuch jhenp sa gaya
 He blushed and said, 'you people are Acharya ji's disciples
 ' bahut hi acha sangeet jaanati hongi
 You will laugh while listening to my song
 ’ ‘sharmaao mat, gaanaa to man se gaaya jaataa he, or man kii vaani par bhi koi hansata he!’shatvari ne gunjan kaa saahas badhaayaa
 a smile erupted on Gunjan's lips
 use shatvari kaa is atmiyata se baat karnaa acha laga
 'what is the harm in singing? shaayad gaanaa sun kar shatvari prabhavit ho jaae,’ gunjan ne sochaa
 Gujun took a long stride in high tone and then started a savannahi song to be sung during the month of Sawan
 uski taan sunakar hi shatvari or aditi ko abhas ho gaya ki uskaa swar madhur tha or suron par uski pakad bhi acchhee thi
 The song humming on the rhythm of the song drowned in the song as if a bhangra immersed in the juice of Makaranda
 shatvari bhi apane pairon kii thap dekar uske suron main apane ghunghruon kii jhankaar milaane lagi
 The soothing drunken air of the spring, the sweet smell of the soil of the fields and the melodious rhythm of the song savored on it
 gunjan ke saath saath shatvari or aditi bhi is geet kii dhara main bah gaye
 By the end of the song, Acharya ji's house also came
 ‘vaah gunjan! tum to bahut acha gaate ho
 And your voice is also sweet
 yadi tum shastreey sangeet sikh lo to bahut bade gayak ban sakate ho
 Surprise was less and happiness was more in the tone of Shatavari
 ‘aap bhi thitholi karti hai, mujh shudra ko bhala koun shastreey sangeet sikhayega?’ gunjan ne apni vivashtaa duharai
 'I will teach you classical music, will you learn from me?' Shatwari said leaning forward and then the aroma of mogre embedded in her silky hair came down in the breath of the humming gun
 kuch kshanon tak gunjan isi mithi gandh main duba rahaa phir achaanak uskaa dhyaan shatvari ke in shabdon se tutaa, ‘soch kar jawaab dena
 Gunjan turned and looked, with Shatwari Aditi heading towards Acharya ji's house
 gunjan uski alhad chaal ko dekhtaa rahaa, kuch mantramugdh sa
 Till date, such a beautiful girl had neither come so close to him nor talked to him in this intimacy
 gunjan bheetar hi bheetar mahak uthaa
 Just like the first soil drops the raw soil smells
 ‘kya shatvari mujhase prabhavit ho gai he? kya vah mujhe chaahane lagi he? gunjan ke man main tarangen uthne lageen
 But then he handled the rising waves in his mind
 ‘kya shudra hote hue ek brahman kanya ke prati aise vichaar rakhana thik he?maa bhi to brahman thi kintu shudra pita se prem vivaah karne ke kaaran unhen apane parijanon se sambandh todane pade the or unhen chhod kar is gaanv main aa basna padaa tha
 The relation of a Brahmin girl to a Shudra will never be acceptable to the society
 uchit yahi hoga ki man kii udaan par ankush lagaaya jaae
 Shatwari's good will also be in this
 uske prastaav ko vinamrata se asweekaar kar dena hi uchit hoga

 bharat kii purv videsh mantri or bhaajapa kii diggaj netaa sushamaa swaraj (sushma Swaraj) ke nidhan se har koi dukhi he
 Night 11 on 6 August
 24 baje sushamaa swaraj kaa dil kaa daura padane se nidhan ho gaya
 There is a lot of stir in the political corridors following the death of India's most powerful speaker Sushma Swaraj
 har koi apni-apni tarah se unako shradhanjali de rahe hai
 However, in such a situation, an old tweet by Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar is becoming fiercely viral on social media
 is twit main divangat sushamaa swaraj (sushma Swaraj) ke saath uzbekistan kii ek mahila bhartiya hindi cinema kaa mashhoor gaanaa 'ichak dana bichak dana' gaate hue najar aa rahi he
 This video of him is becoming very viral on social media
 Bollywood knows no boundaries! More so in Uzbekistan where Raj kapoor and Nargis are household names
 Salute to this Uzbek woman for her spirit as she hums the song 'ichak dana beech dana' from the classic Shri 420! @sushmaswarajpic

 In Uzbekistan, where Raj Kapoor and Nargis are identified from house to house
 is uzbek mahila ko unki lagan ke liye salaam he kyonki vah clasik film 'shri 420 (shri 420)' kaa gaanaa 'ichak dana bichak dana' ga rahi hai
 'sushma had greatly helped the Indian nationals trapped abroad as foreign ministers
 sushamaa twitor par kaaphi active rahati thimaur musibat main fanse logon kii madad karti thim
 Sushma Swaraj also had responsibilities in the Union Cabinet before the Ministry of External Affairs like the Department of Telecommunications, Health and Family Welfare and Parliamentary Affairs
 rajkeey mahila snatakottar mahavidhyalay kii website ko hack kar liya gaya he
 The flag of Pakistan is being hoisted in the hacked website
 saath hi isamen pakistan jindabad bhi likhaa gaya he
 The group named Blackscorpion has taken responsibility for the hack
 havers ne hack kiye gaye mahavidhyalay kii website par apane fasebuk acount kaa URL diya he
 Which is https: / / www
 facebook

 havers ne hekking ke sandarbh main kisi khaas kaaran kaa khulaasa nahin kiya he
 Also, nothing has been written other than writing in Pakistan
 hack kii gai website kaa link- http: / / gwpgc
 ac
 in he
 This is not the first time a website hacking incident has occurred in India
 isse pehle bhi kai websites hack kii jaati rahi hai
 It has also included websites of educational institutions
 pichley salwaneeth srinagaraki website ko ek kii maheene main teen baar hack kiya gaya tha
 After hacking this website, the message was written that if Kashmir dares to ask, then it will rip off
 isse andaja lagaaya gaya tha ki ye kaam algaavvaadiyon kaa tha
 Taking a historic step, the Narendra Modi government has done away with the effect of Article 370 giving special rights to Jammu and Kashmir
 kendriya grahamantri amit shah ne somvaar ko rajyasabha main ek aitihaasik sankalp pesh kiya, jisamen anuchhed 370 ke pravadhaanon ko hataane ke saath hi rajya kaa vibhaajan jammu kashmir evam ladakh ke do centre shasit kshetron ke rup main karne kii jaankaree di
 After this decision of Modi government, questions are arising as to whether the stonewalling will stop in Kashmir and tighten the antics of separatism
 jammu-kashmir ko lekar modi sarkaar ne baqayda pre-planning ke saath kadam badaye hai
 The government first passed the UAPA amendment bill from both houses to curb terrorism
 iske baad jammu-kashmir main badi taadaad main suraksha balon ko tainaat kiya gaya
 The leaders of Jammu and Kashmir were put under house arrest at midnight before Article 370 was taken
 iske baad puure rajya main dhara 144 lagu kar di gai
 After this, the government took major decisions regarding Jammu and Kashmir
 modi sarkaar ke faisle ke baad algaavvaadiyon kii mushkilen bad sakati hai
 However, the government had already kept a tight rein on the separatists
 jammu-kashmir ke algaavvaadiyon kii suraksha puri tarah se khatm kar di gai thi
 a large number of separatists were put in jail
 iske alaava algaavvaadiyon ke teror funding kii jaanch kar unki qamar pehle hi tod di thi
 At the same time, the jamaat-e-islami of Kashmir was banned as a terrorist organization
 LIVE: modi sarkaar ne 370 main jammu-kashmir ko mili visheshadhikaar khatm kiye, raashtrapati kii manzooreemodi sarkaar dwaara dhara 370 kaa asar khatm kar algaavvaadiyon ke astitv ko bhi puri tarah se khatm karne kii koshish kii he
 After Jammu and Kashmir attains Union Territory status, it will be difficult to face the separatists
 aise main agar wo kisi tarah se desh ke khilaaf gatividhiyaan karte hue paae jate hai to unhen UAPA kanoon ke tahat kadi karrwai kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 The government has made the UAPA law very stringent
 kashmir se judaa Article 370 sthaayee he yaa asthaayee? jaane samvidhan visheshgyon kii raijammu-kashmir ke centre shasit rajya banane ke baad kashmir ko mila special stats puri tarah se khatm ho gaya he
 In such a situation, the people who throw stones on the streets in the valley will be able to be screwed
 darasal ab jammu-kashmir main rajya sarkaar se zyada centre sarkaar kaa dakhal hoga
 In this way, political patronage will also be less for the stone-pellers
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki patharbaji main kami aegi
 i spent the first eight years of my life in Hisar, Haryana
 mujhe yaad he, vahaan main apane mata-pita ko haryana krishi vishvavidhyalay ke faikalti club main badminton khelte dekhati
 Then i was so young that i was not conscious of anything badminton
 baad main maine paaya ki vahaan log bacchiyon ke prati khaas taur se udasin bhav rakhte hai
 i was surprised when i was told that my grandmother had not come to see me for a month after i was born
 ve pote ke janm kii badi aas lagaae baithi thim
 i was born seven years after my only sister in the Jat family
 so, mere janm se unhen baari niraashaa hui thi
 However, it had a very big message for me, which i now understand very well
 yah sandesh tha betiyon ke prati bhedbhaav kaa
 Fortunately, we came to Hyderabad, where many sports have grown significantly compared to many other states
 isane mujhe apana kariyar safaltaapurvak banane main madad kii
 i got coordinators like Bharat Petroleum and now Deccan Chronicle at the age of 14
 ham us apartment main rahete hai jise mujhe mili puraskaron kii rakam se kharida gaya he
 My parents bought it in my name
 kai hariyaanvi khilaadi, khaskar mahila khilaadi utane bhaagyashaalee nahin hai
 They do not get sponsors despite performing brilliantly
 pichley do varshon main haryana sarkaar ne khilaadiyon ko kai protsaahan die hai
 The highest prize money ever and a car for those who won medals at the Delhi Commonwealth Games
 kisi duusari rajya sarkaar ne ab tak aisi peshkash nahin kii he
 This offer of the Haryana government is welcome
 ve sab mere bahut kareeb hai kyonki unamem se adhiktar jat hai
 Some even told me that in view of the traditional thinking towards girls and the behavior of khap panchayats towards girls, at the age of only 20 i am an inspiration for them
 apane abhibhavakon or niyokta-haryana police- se mili protsaahan ke kaaran in mahila khilaadiyon ne itnaa saahasik pradarshan kiya he
 They are given special work and now they are better taken care of than before
 gramin haryana main purushon kaa hi varchasv he or iskaa asar khelon par bhi dikhataa he
 But it will definitely make a difference that most of the 29 medals in the state have been won by women players
 abhibhavakon ko zyada samajhdaari or khule dimag se kaam karnaa chahie
 My tau and relatives are not in favor of letting the girls out of the house for anything
 unke saath meri baatcheet shaayad hi hoti he
 My parents are more open-minded
 unhone mujhe kaaphi protsaahit kiya he
 My sister married her choice, which she accepted
 agar abhibhavakon se zyada samarthan or protsaahan mili to zyada ladkiyaan baahar niklengi or unka jivan behatar banegaa
 Girls have to fight for their rights
 khelon main zyada avasar nikaalkar ham acchhee shuruyaat kar sakate hai
 More organizers also need to come forward
 yah khilaadiyon ke behatar pradarshan se hi sambhav ho paaegaa
 My wish is that the racket-played sports in Haryana should be made more popular because they have a long career
 isse vahaan mahilaon kii sthiti bhi behatar hogi
 The state government can start by establishing an academy there for these sports like badminton and tennis
 main khelon par isliye jor de rahi hum kyonki inamen mehnat karne waalon ke liye shuru main hi avasaron ke daravaaje khul jate hai
 For this, rigorous training of nine-ten hours is required daily
 yah kaaphi shaareerik shram kii maang karata he
 Players also have to become very strong mentally, especially girls, because they usually have this weakness
 iske liye aupchaarik shiksha kaa tyaag karnaa padegaa
 Both sports and education are difficult to run simultaneously
 agar koi donon ko saadh le to baat hi kya!ham serena williams jaisi shaktishaalee khilaadi se apni tulana kisi tarah nahin kar sakate
 We girls have to become number one in the world in many sports
 yah koi asambhav baat nahin he
 It is just a matter of preparing your mind
 meri kom ne apni patibaddhta se hamen rasta dikhaaya he
 If the talent is chosen at the age of seven-eight, then we can make girls world champions by the age of 18-20
 ham beshak kaamyaab ho sakate hai
 Saina Nehwal is the world's number two female badminton player agle maheene maidan par shuru hone vaala he, sabase bada ghamaasan
 India will take on Pakistan in their first match
 bharat or pakistan kii timen jab maidan par utarati hai to halaat bilkul jang jaise najar aate hai
 Players may lose to any team in the world, but they do not approve of losing to each other
 pakistan kii team har baar kii tarah is baar bhi nayaa itihaas banane kii baat kah rahi he
 Whether India is talking about preparing itself according to the tournament, former captain Pakistan Younis Khan says that there is a chance to change history and this time i have lagata he ki pakistan bharat ko is baar world cap main haraa saktaa he
 Pakistan's record against India in the World Cup is very poor
 world cap ke kisi bhi match main pakistan bharat ko nahin haraa paaya he
 Its teas definitely remain intact in the Pakistan team
 1975 se lekar 2011 ke bich main 10 world cap ho chuke hai
 In these 10 World Cups, these teams have clashed five times and each time India has won
 pakistan ke liye bharat ke khilaaf chunauti kai or vajahon se is baar or mushkil najar aati he
 Team India is the champion of champions and looks much stronger than Pakistan in a smaller format
 saath hi unke ghaatak spinner said ajmal pabandi ke chalate world cap main nahin hai, jabaki tej gendbaaz umr gul chotil hone ke kaaran team main nahin he
 The figures after the 2011 World Cup have been on par
 2011 world cap ke baad donon tiimon ke bich chah van-de match hue hai, jinamein bharat ko teen main jeet mili, jabaki pakistan ne bhi teen baar baazi maari
 The first match of India and Pakistan in the World Cup is against each other, whose tickets were sold as soon as it was issued, so it is understandable that Fans are more interested in this match than other matches of the tournament

 On pollution and trouble breathing in Delhi and its adjoining areas for the last several days, Union Environment Minister Dr
 Harsh Vardhan says that we are working at our level and it will take 2-3 days for the situation to be rectified

 Harsh Vardhan said that immediately after the level of poor quality level was held, the Task Force met
 is task force ke andar kendriya pradooshan niyantran board ke hi adhikari nahin hote balki swasthya kshetra se jude peshewar bhi hote hai
 We have issued advisories across the country in this matter and have started work at our level
 unhone aage kaha ki ham logon ko yah bhi kah rahe hai ki dhul kam se kam nikaale jaaen
 We have asked the state governments to issue necessary guidelines in this regard
 nirmaanadhin imaaraton par nirmaan turant band karaayaa jaae, jissedhulkam se kam nikle or is sthiti par kaabo paaya ja sake
 Union Environment Minister Dr
 Harsh Vardhan says that there is no lack of any kind of action from our side
 dilli ke uparajyapal anil baijal ne bhi is sambandh main baithak kii or paryaavaran kii sthiti sudhaarney ke kai faisle liye
 He accused the Delhi government in this situation that on one hand the people of Delhi are in so much trouble due to the dust, there should be action, the government should have kept an eye on the situation, then the Chief Minister is lying in the air condition rooms with his ministers and saying It has been said that we are going to picket
 teen-chaar saal ke baad jab unhone kuch kiya nahin
 You were throwing dust in your eyes like this
 upar se yah paryaavaran kii dhul aa gai he
 Even to save it, some are not paying attention
 yah bahut durbhagyapurna he
 Regarding the level of pollution, Harsh Vardhan said that the central government is doing what it can
 mausam vibhaag kaa kahana he ki agle do-teen din main yah sab sahi ho jayega
 He said that to correct the situation, construction work would have to be stopped, along with water spraying wherever there was dust
 kya kahata he mausam vibhagamausam vibhaag ke mutabik pichley 2 dinon se chal rahi dhul bhari garm hawaaon kii vajah se vaataavaran main maheen kanon kii maatra kaaphi bad gai he
 It is estimated that by the evening of June 15, the amount of dust will begin to heat up in all areas of northwest India including Delhi
 aisa isliye hoga kyonki uttar pashchim bharat main aandhi pani kii activity bad jaaegi
 According to Kuldeep Srivastava, director of Meteorological Department, dusty winds coming from Rajasthan are going up to two and a half kilometers above the surface of the ground
 in hawaaon kii raftaar 35 kilometre prati ghante he
 Due to the anti-cyclonic circulation here, winds are coming from Rajasthan and are not turning towards Uttar Pradesh
 is vajah se dilli ensiaar ke upar dhul kii maatra zyada ikattha ho rahi he
 Kuldeep says that there is not going to be any significant change in the next 24 hours, but from the evening of June 15, the speed of dusty winds coming from Rajasthan will decrease slightly due to which the amount of dust coming in all areas including delhi-ncr is reduced
 It will be done
