 Sonia Gandhi and other leaders came out to bid farewell, but the gate did not open
 chunki kisi bhi netaa ke nidhan ke baad uskaa shav party mukhyalay main aam kaaryakartaaon ke darshan ke liye rakhane kaa rivaaj tha

 com / mdftupqrqna post shared by Viral Bhayani (@viralbhayani) on Sep 22, 2018 at 3:58am pdtan opportunity to give competition to the Kardashians just went wasted! a week back i mentioned about ‘my badge of honour' that i was going to receive
 And i did and am happy to share about it with the intention of it being received with love
 As that's the only reason i am posting it
 Love for self and gratitude for the universe
 The picture might be disturbing for some, but these drains have become my dumbells for a few days
 i was detected with DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) in my right breast with high grade malignant cells
 Simply put stage 0 cancer / pre-cancerous stage, with cancer cells multiplying in a contained area
 The result i have become a half Indian version of Angelina Jolie (since only one breast was involved)! i told my doctor now is the time to give some competition to the Kardashians since Pamela is passé
 But no one listened to me, so now i have a portion of my back tissue in my breast
 Perhaps now i can do chin-ups with my breasts! Jokes apart, this obstacle has given me a new definition of life
 Respect it's unpredictability and have the faith and courage to be the hero of your own drama of life
 The invincible human spirit is God like, gives you the courage to endure and the will to revive
 There is nothing that human spirit can't do
 Also i want women of all ages to be aware
 i am 35, and i was returned twice over from a mammogram
 If any symptoms come up, think of it as a protective force and get yourselves examined
 Also we are so obsessed with boobs
 This mastectomy has left me with even more self love! Big, small, left or right inclined, gravity pulling or defying, or even none, each breast the presence or lack of it has a story to tell
 Mine has made me a 2
 0 version of myself!

" " In Parliament on Tuesday, the central government shared information about the terrorist attacks on the Amarnath Yatra
 grih rajyamantri hansraj ahir ne is dauraan bataaya ki pichley 27 saalon main 36 baar aatankiyon ne amarnath yatra ko nishaanaa banaaya he

 During this, he told that in last years, pilgrims visiting Amarnath 36 times have been attacked by terrorists
 unhone bataaya ki in hamalon main 53 tirthayatriyon kii maut hui he, jabaki 167 log jakhmi hue hai
 Explain that on July 10 this month, the terrorists targeted the bus of Amarnath pilgrims in Anantnag of Jammu and Kashmir
 aatankiyon ne bas par tabadatod firing kii thi
 In which 8 devotees were killed
 jabaki bees se zyada yatri ghayal ho gaye the
 This bus of passengers from Gujarat was coming from Srinagar towards Jammu after the Amarnath Yatra
 upi netaaon ke saath loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon kii samiksha karte hue bahujan samaaj party kii adhyaksh mayawati ne bada bayaan diya he
 Mayawati has said that the coalition has not yielded the expected results in the elections
 unhone daawa kiya ki yadav vot transfar nahin ho paaya he
 Therefore, the coalition will now be reviewed
 itnaa hi nahin mayawati ne yahaan tak kah diya ki sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav apni patni or bhai ko bhi chunaav nahin jita paae hai
 According to sources, after this stance of Mayawati, the SP-BSP alliance seems to be on the verge of breakdown
 bispi pramukh mayawati ne somvaar ko dilli main chunavi haar kii samiksha kii
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Mayawati called a meeting of party workers at the all-india level in view of the BSP not getting satisfactory seats and the debacle in some states
 upi ke sabhi basapa saansadon or jiladhyakshon ke saath baithak main mayawati ne kaha ki party sabhi vidhansabha upachunaav main ladegi or ab 50 fisadi vot kaa lakshya lekar raajnneeti kerani he
 Mayawati also accused of rigging evms
 baithak se pehle uttar pradesh ke shravasti se navnirvaachit basapa saansad ram shiromani verma ne iviem ghotaale kaa aarope lagaaya
 He said that there has been a massive scam
 ham log pehle se kah rahe hai ki ballat paper se chunaav hona chahie, jise naa to chunaav ayog maan rahaa he, naa sarkaar maan rahi he
 We want the election to be conducted with ballot paper, which is fair
 bahanji jo bhi disha nirdesh dengi, ham uskaa paalan karenge
 BSP chief Mayawati on Monday discharged the election in-charge of six states and directed the party's newly elected mps, Zone Incharge and District Heads to attend the meeting on Monday
 isamen jila ke party adhyakshon ke alaava varisht netaa satish chandra mishra bhi maujuud hai
 Several other senior leaders of the party are also participating in the meeting
 isse pehle ravivaar ko mayawati ne chah rajyon ke loksabhaa chunaav prabhariyon ko hataa diya
 Along with this, he also evicted the state presidents of three states from the post

 Along with this, he also evicted the BSP presidents of Delhi and Madhya Pradesh from the post
 somvaar ko bispi supremeo upi ke jone prabhariyon or jiladhyakshon ke saath hi loksabhaa pratyaashiyon or navanivarchit saansadon ke saath baithak karengi
 The BSP has won 10 seats in the Lok Sabha elections this time, performing better than in 2014, but the alliance has got fewer seats as expected
 mana ja rahaa he ki somvaar kii baithak main sanghathan main pherbadal ko lekar ahm faisla ho saktaa he
 According to party sources, there are 40 state coordinators and zonal coordinators on Mayawati's radar, on which Gaj may fall
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki loksabhaa chunaav main bispi ko anumaan se bahut kam siten mili hai
 Because of this, Mayawati is very angry
 gauratlab he ki 2012 ke uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav se bispi kaa graph lagaataar girtaa ja rahaa he
 The situation was such that the BSP could not even open an account in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections

 Former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar, who came into the fray as a UPA candidate in the presidential election, suffered the biggest blow from her own state Bihar
 upie kii sarkaar vaale is rajya se mira kumaar kii jeet jaruri thi lekin mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke alag rukh kii keemat jagjivan ram kii is beti ko chukaani padi or duusare rajyon kii tarah yahaan bhi endie candidet ramnath kovind hi baari pade
 Meera Kumar got a lot of votes from Bihar but she could not beat Kovind
 kovind ko bihar se kul 22 hajaar 490 vot mili jabaki unki pratidwandvi mira kumaar mahaj 18 hajaar 867 vot hi hasil kar sakin
 The biggest reason for this result against Meira Kumar was the support of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his party JDU to Ramnath Kovind
 ramnath kovind ko jabaindie ne raashtrapati padke liye apana pratyaashee banaaya to us samay wo bihar ke governor the
 As soon as his name was announced, Nitish Kumar formally met Kovind as the Chief Minister of the state and later announced that he had a lot of respect for Kovind and hence his party would support Kovind in the presidential elections
 upie ne banaaya mira kumaar ko ummidavaarkovind ke naam kaa elaan hone ke baad upie ne mira kumaar ko unke mukaable apana ummidavaar ghoshit kiya
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi called it a battle of ideology
 tabhi se is baat kii ore sabaki nigaah thim ki kya nitish kumaar apane faisle par punarvichaar karte hue kovind kii jagah mira kumaar ko samarthan denge
 Meira Kumar was called the daughter of Bihar but Nitish did not change his decision
 nitish kaa tarknithish kaa kahana tha ki bihar kii beti mira kumaar ko haarane ke liye maidan main utaara gaya he or yadi congress vaaki unhen koi mahatvapurn jimmedaari dena chaahati thi to us samay unhen ummidavaar banaati jab aankade upie ke paksh main the
 Congress should plan a victory strategy in 2019 and make Bihar's daughter president in 2022
 nitish ke is rukh se tay ho gaya ki mira kumaar ko bihar main kovind ke mukaable haar kaa saamana karnaa padegaa kyonki nitish ke kovind ke kheme main jane se aankade endie pratyaashee ke paksh main ho gaye
 RJD has 80 seats in Bihar assembly, 71 seats of JDU and 27 of Congress

 The 55-year-old woman in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh lost her life just because she did not stop her daughter from wearing jeans
 aligarh main mangalvaar ko ek maa ko bheed ne milakar itnaa maaraa ki use apni jindagi se haath dhonaa padaa
 This mother's fault was only that she allowed her daughter to wear jeans
 isse bhi zyada chaunkaane vaali baat ye he ki jis bheed ne is maa ko maut ke ghat utaara uski aguwai bhi ek mahila kar rahi thi
 The incident is from Jwalajipuram Colony in Aligarh where Phulwati along with some people barged into the house of his neighbor Netrapal Dubey and killed his wife Kamlesh
 kamalesh or netrapal kii 20 saal kii beti he jiskaa naam gunjan he
 Netrapal and Gunjan also suffered deep injuries during this period, after which both were admitted to the hospital
 is maamle main phulvati or rabindra singh naam ke ek shaks ko giraftaar kar liya gaya he
 Both were sent to jail in connection with the murder of Kamlesh
 peshey se driver netrapal ne police ko bataaya ki phulvati uski beti gunjan ke genes pahanane par kaaphi samay se aitraaj jataa rahi thi
 According to Netrapal, 'my daughter is an undergraduate student, she feels very comfortable wearing jeans
 uske college kii or ladkiyaan bhi genes pahenti hai
 But the contractor's wife Phoolwati came to me one day and asked me to stop Gunjan from wearing jeans as it is polluting the environment of the colony
 ' In Delhi, on Thursday, the price of petrol, 5 paise, a reduction of 6 paise, the price of petrol and diesel has been cut once again
 is katautee ke baad petrol kaa bhav dilli, kolkata, mumbai or chennai main 5 paise prati litre kam ho gaya he
 At the same time, in the four metros, it is now getting 6 paise per liter less than the day before
 bataa den ki buudhvaar ko petrol or dijal ke bhav sthir rahe the
 What is the new rate according to List Indian Oil website: The new price of petrol in Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai is 73 respectively
 54 rupee, 76
 18 rupees, 79
 15 rupee or 76
 38 per liter

 51 rupee prati litre ho gaye hai

 Let us tell you that on September 14, after the drone attack on Saudi Arabian oil company Saudi Aramco, on September 16, the international market had recorded the biggest one-day rise in crude oil prices after 28 years

 dilli main jab pradooshan khatarnaak str tak pahunchataa he to kya us par lagaam sambhav he
 Have the governments been able to make any efforts so far that have reduced pollution in a few years
 yah kuch aise sawaal hai jo dilli ensiaar main rahane vaale har shaks ke man main hai
 The sad aspect is that there is no answer to all these questions
 ye he wo report jisase pataa chalata he ki dilli kaa pradooshan kam hone kaa naam kyon nahin le rahaa he
 No parai starch is burnt in Delhi nor bricks killers run, but even then pollution makes Delhi among the most polluted cities in the world
 to bada sawaal yah he ki firadilli main pradooshanki badi vajah aakhir kya he
 There are thousands of small and large industrial units in Delhi, which use coal in large numbers
 badarpur thermal power jaise plant hai, dilli main dhabas hon yaa bade five star hotel, har jagah tandoori khaanaa banane ko lekar koi sawaal nahin kiya jaataa
 There are millions of two-wheeler and four-wheelers, with new cars coming on the roads every day
 ab bada sawaal yah he ki kya in par lagaam lagane main sarkaar kii koi ruchi he, yaa phir vyavhaarik taur par in sabko dilli se hataanaa sambhav he
 Gaurav Kumar Bansal, a lawyer for pollution related cases, says that even if the polluting things in books are stopped, it is not possible to close them practically
 dilli pradooshanke maamle main itani vikat paristhiti main he or dukhad yah bhi he ki hamaare niti nirmaataaon ko iskaa bakhubi andaja he
 Right after this, there are high litter mountains like Mount Everest in Delhi
 jimame jab tak aag lagati rahati he or usase khatarnaak gas risati rahati he
 The three big courts of the country, the Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and NGT are serious about the issue of pollution but governments and officials do not appear serious about it
 haal hi main engiti ne pradooshan ke maamle main dilli or punjab sarkaar kii laaparvaahee ko dekhte hue 50-50 karod kaa jurmaana bhi donon rajya sarkaron par thok diya he
 To be honest, neither can we control our development, nor on industries, nor on our dhabas
 dilli ko agar swatchta deni he to yah long turm process he, jisapar sarkaar ko or logon ko gambhirtha se kaam karnaa hoga
 The EPCA also issues guidelines for governments from time to time on the directions of the Supreme Court
 lekin kahin par sarkaron kii ichhashakti or kahin par vyavhaarik dikkaton ke chalate niyamon kaa paalan ho hi nahin paata
 There is a complete ban on open fire in Delhi, but garbage will be seen burning on one of the nooks of Delhi
 yani sawaal he ki kaagaj par niyamon ko utaarne ke baad sarkaar pradooshan par aakhir kaise niyantran paa sakati he
 Unless it is applied on the ground

 Arvind Kejriwal, a key member of Team Anna, fiercely attacked the corrupt leaders amidst a daylong fast of Anna Hazare at Jantar Mantar in Delhi
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki vyavastha main parivartan ke liye sakht lokapal laayaa janaa bahut jaruri he
 Kejriwal said that out of 34 Union ministers, 14 have serious corruption related cases
 arvind kejariwal ne daawa kiya ki agar sakht lokapal aa gaya, to inamen se kam se kam 14 mantriyon ke khilaaf exiaar darj hogi or ye jail chale jaaenge
 Kejriwal cited the names of the ministers and the charges against them one by one, citing the websites of newspapers and TV channels, including P
W
 chidambaram, ajit singh or sharad pavaar aadi shaamil hai
 Kejriwal raised the question that how will the CBI take action against these corrupt leaders? He asked how the minister, who is involved in corruption, will pass a strict Lokpal
 However, the people affected by corruption are looking towards Team Anna to get relief from this
 dekhnaa he ki team anna aam logon kii apekshaaon par kitna khara utarati he
 The debate of holding Lok Sabha elections and Assembly elections together has once again started in the country
 darasal buudhvaar ko madhya pradesh main ek kaarykram main shaamil hone pahunche chunaav ayukta opi ravat ne is bare main kuch bayaan diya tha
 In his statement, the Election Commissioner had said that only after September 2018, we can get Lok Sabha and Assembly elections together in India
 iske peeche unka tark jaruri sansadhano kii kami bataaya gaya tha
 According to the Election Commissioner, a total of 40 lakh machines will be required to conduct assembly and Lok Sabha elections simultaneously
 kendra sarkaar ne chunaav ayog se maangi thi jaankareechunaav ayukta ne bataaya ki kendra sarkaar ne is babat chunaav ayog se jaankaree maangi thi
 After which the central government has provided the necessary funds
 kendra sarkaar ne vivipat mashin ke liye 3400 karod rupee or iviem ke liye 12 hajaar karod rupee die hai
 The Election Commission has given orders to two companies in the public sector, all the machines will be delivered by September 2018, after which we can have elections simultaneously whenever we want
 aapako bataa den ki desh ke samvidhan main is baat kii ijaajat he ki chunaav ayog apni suvidhanusaar chaahe to chunaav 'samay purv' karvaa saktaa he
 Modi also wants some Prime Minister Modi has also expressed his opinion many times that the successive assembly elections not only affect the functioning of the government but also puts an economic burden on the country
 purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne bhi kii thi vakalatpurv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne is saal ganatantr diwas kii purv sandhya par desh ko sambodhit karte samay bhi desh main chunaav sudhaaron kii vakaalat kii thi
 Pranab had asked the Election Commission to take forward the idea of holding both elections in consultation with political parties
 agar aisa hua to kai rajyon main ekasaath badalegi sarkarpradhanmantri or chunaav ayog kii apil agar tamaam raajnneetik dal maan lete hai or samaypurv loksabhaa chunaav par ve ekamat ho jate hai to kai rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav bhi ekasaath ho sakate hai
 Actually, the tenure of the legislative assemblies of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram ends in november-december 2018
 iske alaava telugana, andhra pradesh or odisha jaise rajyon main bhi vidhansabha chunaav in prastaavit chunaavon ke saath karwaae ja sakate hai
 The term of the Legislative Assembly of these states is till April 2019
 mana ja rahaa he ki agar is prakriya ko agle loksabhaa chunaavon se lagu kar diya jaae to 10 saal main zyaadaatar rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav loksabhaa ke saath hi honge
 The bjp's intention behind the 'premature' election is only in Mizoram in the working of the 4 Legislative Assembly (madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram) ending in november-december next year where BJP is not in power
 iske alaava odisha main bijedy or andhra pradesh main tidipi ko 2014 kii modi lahar kaa phayda jamkar hua tha
 Because of this, there is a high expectation that 'premature' elections will be agreed in almost all the states
 raajnneetik jaankaron ke mutabik bijepi loksabhaa chunaav 'samay purv' karwaane ke paksh main isliye he kyonki use kahin naa kahin is baat kaa andeshaa he ki 2014 main chalaa 'modi kaa jaadu' dhire-dhire chhantataa ja rahaa he
 Increasing unemployment, inflation and problems of farmers are becoming a threat to the government
 2019 tak halaat or bure naa ho jaaen yah dar bijepi ke sheersh netritv ko abhi se sataane laga he
 Now, if such a 'premature' election takes place, it will be Modi's helplessness or 'master stroke' it will tell the time
 modi sarkaar bhi phoonk-phoonk kar rakh rahi he kadamidhar chunaavon ke maddenjar modi sarkaar ne bhi apni kaaryastylee main ranneetik badlaav laane kaa faisla kiya he
 a few weeks ago, in a report by the company Barclay India, it was revealed that the Modi government should hardly pay any significant improvement in its remaining tenure
 vah apni uplabdhiyon kaa prachaar karne tathaa apekshaakrit kam karon ke saath lokahitaishi dikhne kii koshish kar sakati he

 The process of change in organization has started in the Congress
 digvijay singh se goa or karnataka ke prabhaar chhina liya gaya he
 In his place KC Venugopal has been put in charge of Karnataka
 vahiin chella kumaar ko goa kaa prabhaar diya gaya he
 Apart from the charge of Karnataka, KC Venugopal has also been given the post of general secretary in the party
 gauratlab he ki goa ke chunavi nateezon main congress sabase badi party hone ke baavjood sarkaar nahin bana pai thi
 In such a situation, questions were being raised on the role of Digvijay Singh
 vahiin sutron ke mutabik party adhyaksh kaa chunaav oktober main hoga
 Rahul Gandhi wishes to become president only through elections
 aise main kayaas yahi hai ki, rahul adhyaksh kaa pad oktober main hi sanbhaalenge
 However, some senior leaders believe that Rahul should be the first nominee, then contest the elections in October
 lekin party sanghathan main badlaav agle kuch dinon main hote rahenge
 Now Madhusudan Mistry will also no longer be the secretary-general, recently Ashok Gehlot has been given the charge of Gujarat by making him the General Secretary
 iske saath hi 4 nae sachiv banaakar unako gahalot ke saath joda gaya he
 Similarly, a general secretary, Madhusudan Mistry, has been made a part of the election committee of the party organization, which led to his discharge from the post of general secretary
 sutron kii maane to jaldi hi haryana ke prabharee mahasachiv kamalnath ko madhya pradesh bheja ja saktaa he, isse ek or mahasachiv kaa pad khaali ho jayega
 Odisha general secretary BK Hariprasad resigned after losing the panchayat elections, when he was asked to continue working till further orders
 iske saath hi mumbai nagar palika chunaavon ko lekar naaraaz hue rajasthan ke prabharee mahasachiv gurudas kaamat bhi apane istife par ade hue hai
 Gradually, instead of shuffling together, instead of making a big change with one stroke, the Congress high command has started the process of altering the organization slowly
 susheel kumaar scindia, jitendra singh, jyotiraditya sindhiya sareekhe netaaon ko mahasachiv banaaya ja saktaa he
 In addition, young leaders close to Rahul will be made secretaries
 ek baat kaa sandesh jarur diya jayega ki, varisht netaaon ko darkinar kar yuvaaon kii hi team nahin banaai ja rahi he, balki varisht or yuvaaon kaa talmail baithaaya ja rahaa he
 In fact, a big change at the same time may offend leaders out of the organization
 isliye ek jatke main badlaav nahin kiye ja rahe
 Apart from this, many adjustments are also being made, so that the leaders are not even angry
 aise main agle kuch dinon main congress sanghathan main badlaav nazar aane lagegaa, jisaki sugabugahat 2014 loksabhaa chunaavon main haar ke baad se chal rahi he
 Another anecdote of playing in India has come to the fore
 jharkhand ke jamshedpur kii rahane vaali antarrashtriya str kii teerandaaj nisha rani datta ne garibi or sarkaar se kisi bhi rup me koi madad na milane ke kaaran apane chaar lakh rupee ke dhanush ko mahaj 50 hajaar rupee me bech diya
 Nisha was troubled by unemployment and was in need of money to repair her raw house, in such a situation, Nisha had no choice but to sell her bow, Nisha has won several medals for India at international level
 nisha berogari se pareshaan thi or use apane kachche ghar kii marammat ke liye paison kii jarurat thi aise main nisha ke paas dhanush bechney ke alaava koi vikalp nahin bachaa tha nisha ne antarrashtriya str par bharat ke liye kai padak jite hai
 The forces of India and China are standing face to face on the Sikkim border
 iske chalate halaat kii samiksha karne army chif bipin ravat guuruuvaar ko sikkim pahunche
 Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang has demanded that India withdraw its army immediately
 kong ne kaha ki ham bharat se apni sena ko turant waapas bulaane kii maang karte hai
 This is a precondition for agreement and negotiation between the two parties
 bataa den ki ek hafte se purvottar rajyasikkim se sate china ke border par tanaavhai
 China has accused Indian soldiers of entering the border and stopping road construction work
 chini sena ne bharat ke do banksron ko tod diya or kaha ki ye china kii seemaa main bane hue the
 China is also sending a strong message from Beijing and is constantly accusing the border of disturbing the atmosphere
 kahaan se shuru hua vivaad?pichley dinon sikkim sector ke donglong menchin kii ore se sadak banane kaa bhartiya sainikon ne virodh kiya
 Subsequently, Chinese troops broke down two of India's bunkers in the Sikkim sector
 china ise apni seemaa main bataa rahaa he
 Indian troops opposed this action of the Chinese army
 tab se abtak donon deshon ke hajaaron sainik aamane-saamne khadey hai
 In fact, India has strengthened its preparations on the China border
 puraane banksron kii jagah nae banksron kii indian army ke nirmaan kaaryon ko china pachaa nahin paa rahaa he or ise uksaau karrwai bataa rahaa he
 What are the objections of China? The incident of Indian bunker removal occurred in the Doka La area of sikkim in the first week of June, causing tension on the indo-china border in the Sikkim region
 china-bharat seemaa vivaad kaa itihaas kaaphi lanbaa he
 The two countries have a 3,488-km-long border that stretches from Jammu and Kashmir to Arunachal Pradesh
 isamen 220 kilometre kaa hissaa sikkim main padataa he
 Since the border line is not completely clear in this area, there is no clear basis of boundary
 jaane vivaad kaa bhutan conectionsikkim sector ke donglong ke jis ilaake main china kii ore se sadak banane kaa bhartiya sainikon ne virodh kiya
 China says that it shares the border with Bhutan and India is the third party
 use isamen bolne kaa adhikaar nahin he, jabaki sachai ye he ki bhutan ke videsh or raksha maamalon ko bharat dekhtaa he or aise main bharat ko china se is masale ko sulajhane kaa puraa haq he
 China does not like this effect of India on Bhutan
 kya kaha chini videsh mantralay ne?china ke videsh mantralay ne bayaan jari kar kaha- ummid he ki desh anya deshon kii samprabhutaa kaa sammaan karen
 The sino-bhutan border is not defined, no third party should interfere in the matter and take irresponsible comments or actions
 china ne bharat par gupt agenda kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha- agar koi teesraa paksh, gupt agenda se, hastkshep karata he to yah bhutan kii samprabhutaa kaa apmaan he
 We do not want to see that because Bhutan deserves sovereignty by the international community
 china ne sikkim sector main sadak nirmaan ko vaid bataaya or jor diya ki yah chini kshetra main banaaya ja rahaa he jo na to bharat kaa or na hi bhutan kaa he
 He said that no other country has the right to interfere
 border par china ko raas nahin aa rahi bharat kii taiyaariyanmodi sarkaar ne pichley teen saal main china seemaa par sainya taiyaariyaan tej kii he
 PM Modi to build mountain strike corps of 1 lakh troops for China border, deal of 36 Rafale fighter jets from France, purchase of Guardian drones from US for Navy in the sea, construction of American fighter aircraft F-16 in India, Howitzer cannon Several steps have been taken, including the purchase of which has shocked China
 iske alaava china seemaa se lagate ilaakon buniyadi suvidhaon ke vikaas ke liye bhi kadam uthaae gaye hai
 Such as the landing of the Globemaster aircraft near the China border, the construction of a road bridge leading to the China border in Assam, the extension of the rail route to Leh, etc
, are steps that China sees as India's growing preparedness at the border
 america se dosti bhi china ko khatak rahipiem modi kii america yatra se bhi china kaaphi baukhalaayaa hua he
 China's response came after pictures of trump-modi's friendship that India was abandoning its policy of non-alignment and standing against China with the US, could prove disastrous for India
 china kyon nahin ban saktaa bharat kaa swaabhaavik dost?kai maamalon par do padosi desh bharat or china aamane-saamne hai
 Recently, China also objected to the Dalai Lama's visit to Arunachal
 jabaki bharat ne us shuddh aadhyatmik yatra bataaya tha
 Earlier India had kept distance from china-pakistan CPEC project, even then China had targeted India
 enesji main bharat kii entry main bhi china baadha banataa rahaa he
 China has also been obstructing India's efforts to ban all terrorists including Hafiz Saeed from Pakistan
 dakshin china sagar main bhi bharat america or japan ke saath milakar china kii dadaageeri kaa virodh karata rahaa he
 All these things have been knocking China
 aise maahaul main china or bharat ke bich sahyog kii sambhaavnaaen bahut kam he
 Keeping this in mind, India is moving forward

 The conflict between the civic center in North Delhi Municipal Corporation and South Delhi Municipal Corporation has started
 maje kii baat to ye he ki donon hi nagar nigam main bijepi satta main he
 Actually the civic center houses the headquarters of North Delhi Municipal Corporation and South Delhi Municipal Corporation, but the Municipal Corporation of Delhi gives it its share
 vahi dakshini dilli nagar nigam ko kirayedar
 On this issue, the Northern Municipal Corporation has issued a notice that the Southern Municipal Corporation should give them money as rent
 notice main saaf ye kaha gaya he ki agar saat dinon ke andar kiraye kaa paisa nahin diya gaya to unkedaftaron main talelga die jaaenge or isaki shuruyaat kamishnar offis se hogi
 According to the Northern Municipal Corporation, South Delhi has not paid even a single rupee since their offices were built here
 saal 2012 se lekar 2016 tak kul 810 karod rupee kiraaya banataa he lekin kai baar notice dene ke baad bhi dakshini dilli nagar nigam is maamle se pallaa jhaadte najar aayaa he
 Actually the North Delhi Municipal Corporation is already going through a financial crisis
 aise main nigam ke sabhi bakaaedaaron se vasuuli kii jaani he
 This time the corporation will take strict steps, as the southern corporation has not yet responded to the notice
 vahiin dakshini dilli nagar nigam ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki civik centre kaa nirmaan tab kiya gaya tha jabatinon emsidi ekthi or us samay teenon nagar nigamon kaa paisa laga tha
 After the split of the MCD, the civic center got 40 per cent share to South Delhi, 40 per cent to North Delhi and 20 per cent to East Delhi Municipal Corporation
 jabaki purvi dilli nagar nigam ko jo mukhyalay diya gaya he, jo dakshinidelli nagar nigamane diya he
 Accordingly, South Delhi has 60 percent share, hence the tenant is North Delhi
 upi sarkaar ne apni cabinet kii pehali hi baithak main kisaanon kii karjamaafee kaa vaada puraa kar diya
 But how much reality and how much it is trapped in the web of arguments and figures
 bainkon se ek lakh rupee tak ke karjadaar kisaanon ke liye rin maafee kaa elaan hua he
 For this, the government exchequer will have to bear a cost of Rs 36 thousand 359 crore
 yani chote auki seemaant kisaanon kii kul taadaad 86 lakh main 36 hajaar karod se bhaag dene par harek kisaan ke hisse 16 hajaar rupee se thodazyaada kii hissedari aati he
 Now, if we look at the figures of UP farmers, there are a total of 34 million farmers
 inamen se lagbhag do karod 15 lakh chote or seemaant kisaan hai
 Of this number, one crore 85 lakh is about 80 percent marginal and the remaining 13 percent is owned by small farmers
 seemaant kisaan ke paas ausatan 0
 45 to 0
 50 hectare jameen he
 In such a situation, even if they keep the land mortgaged, then they cannot get a loan of more than Rs 50 thousand
 uttar pradesh main 64 lakh 14 hajaar kisaanon kaa sheduld bainkon se kul karj 86 hajaar 241 karod rupee he
 Including cooperative banks, loan of Rs 6000 crore from them
 yani kul 92 hajaar 241 karod rupee kaa karj
 The government announced an amnesty, a loan of only 36 thousand 359 crores
 congress ke pravaktaa randeep singh surajevaala kii pratikriya to ye rahi ki uttar pradesh main kheti or kisaanon ke aankadon kii roshni menfasali karj bhi do kism kaa he
 One is cropped and the other is term loan
 ab zyaadaatar kisaan tranctor, bail yaa phir chote thresar ke liye hi lone lete hai
 Because even if the crop is bad, they can compensate by giving these machines on rent
 uski maafee yaa sabsidi kaa koi praavdhaan isamen nahin he
 That is, such a provision for loan waiver also has the disadvantage that out of the small cultivators crushing the loan crusher, nine farmers will have less oil
 phir to radha bhi sarkaar kii hi naachegi

 ' unhone janata ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'ham congress ko manaa manaakar thak gaye ki gathbandhan kar lo, gathbandhan kar lo

 What is creativity? What is art? Where does it come from? We know what it is not It's not your social status
 It's not your job title
 It's not your appearance
 It's not even the image you see in the mirror
 Creativity and its sister Art reach us from the sweet spot of the universe- the soul you might say- through mystery
 But i do know that the creator- artist is the channel for it
 Let me tell you how hard it is to birth anything original or authentic
 i personally labored for years over my book, quelled the doubts and noise from others and did not emerge until i had almost undone myself
 Because it's a calling
 And when i was moving through dark spaces of self-doubt or hitting creative blocks, i would turn to the work that @shiloshivsuleman puts out into the world and shares on her Instagram handle for inspiration
 i can recognize when a creator works honourably and deeply, bleeding, sacrificing, unsleeping, stretching herself in the direction of emotional bravery to produce work that births those feelings we all look for in day to day life
 To feel inspired
 To feel alive
 That's why when something dishonorable happens, we need to stand up and speak up
 To hold up a mirror to these makers to make them understand THIS IS NOT RIGHT
 It's come to light that a big budget film production has ripped off one of Shilo's original creations
 This is NOT inspiration but blatant theft
 In no world, is this acceptable
 The production did not contact the creator, ask her permission nor offer to collaborate or offer a credit
 Nothing
 This is not right
 i believed the Hindi film industry was evolving necessarily past stealing storylines and rampant plagiarism but the producers of Shahoo have obviously not gained the memo when it comes to art
 Here's the thing- Creators are worthy of worship
 What they produce are more lasting and precious so than all the other 'things' we accumulate that can be taken away
 Let's hold these producers accountable for their infuriating, dishonourable action
 How would you feel if a thief slid into your home and took away your most prized possessions? Your heart
 Your soul
 And your livelihood

 It is not an inspiration, but a theft, which is not acceptable anywhere in the world

 Operation 15 August
 ye kahani he us saazish kii jo jab beparda hui to dusron ko darshan dene vaale sant asaram baapu ko khud jail darshan karnaa padaa
 What happened in the afternoon of August 15, 2013, in seclusion, 40 km away from Jodhpur
 is 15 agast kii taiyaari ke liye asaram baapu or unke chaar chelon ne kab, kaise, or kya-kya saazish rachi? asaram kab se us naaballig ladki ke peeche padaa tha? ye sari baaten, sari kahani, sara sach or puri saazish aapke saamne hogi or aapako bataate hai ki kaise asaram ko umr kaid kii sazaa di gai
 Chhindwara Gurukul, Madhya Pradesh, January 2013 was the beginning of the year 2013
 asaram baapu chah saal baad chhindwara aa rahe the
 Baba has a Gurukula in Chhindwara
 jisamen kareeb aath sau ladkiyaan padhati hai
 In this Gurukul, around 70 girls were preparing to give the exam of XII, while about the same number of girls were going to reach from XI to XII
 gyaravahin se 12veen main ja rahi unheen ladakipoon main se ek wo thi wo
 
 
 Which Baba was eyeing for many months
 darasal, us ladki par pehali baar baba kii nazar 2012 main uttarakhand main padi thi
 Asaram Babaki's intention deteriorated upon seeing him
 baad main pataa chalaa ki wo ladki baba ke hi chhindwara gurukul main padhati he
 Even before the Havasbhari plot reached Chhindwara, Baba sent his special servant Shilpi as warden of Gurukul and sent to Chhindwara
 or iske saath hi shuru hui havas bhari sajeesh kii wo kahani jiskaa clymex swatantraaa diwas yani 15 agast ko saamne aayaa
 Asaram had realized his intention, Shilpi started misleading the girl as soon as she reached Chhindwara Gurukul on the orders of the victim
 wo use kisi tarah baba ke paas jane ko taiyaar karne kii koshishon main jute gai
 The effort was on
 par ladki taiyaar nahin thi
 Actually, the girl had realized Asaram's intention during her first meeting with Baba in Uttarakhand
 par usne ye baat tab kisi ko bataai nahin thi
 The girl's brother was also studying in Chhindwara Gurukul itself
 use laga ki gharavaalon ko bataane se donon bhai-bahan kii padhai kharaab ho jaaegi
 Shilpi told the girl that the talk of ghosts continued
 shilpi ladki ko manaati rahi
 But it did not work
 janvari se jari koshish july aate-aate bhi naakaam ho rahi thi
 Now the month of August had arrived
 baba ke sabar kaa baandh tut rahaa tha
 It was difficult to wait any longer
 shilpi par dabaav lagaataar bad rahaa tha
 The increasing pressure forced Shilpi to play another move
 usne ab ladki ko ye yakeen dilaanaa shuru kar diya ki us par bhoot-pret kaa saaya he
 She started telling him how his mind does not feel in any work
 kyon wo dhai-dhai ghante bathroom main rahati he?baba ko dikhaane ke liye taiyaar hue parijandhire-dhire ladki ke dimag main bhootpret kii baat daal kar shilpi ne asli jaal phenkaa
 He told the girl that if she once surrendered herself to Baba, then all the sickness would be removed
 par baba kii niyat se waakif ladki ab bhi taiyaar nahin thi
 Then Shilpi played the last wager
 usne shahjahanpur main ladki ke maa-baap se sampark kiya
 He told them that Shilpi is possessed by ghosts
 ek baar baba ko dikhaa den to thik ho sakati he
 After listening to Shilpi, the girl's father was not ready, but the mother definitely agreed
 shilpi ne ladki ke maa-baap ko ye bhi kaha ki baba ke paas ilaaj ke liye wo donon bhi saath ja sakate hai
 Hearing this, the family agreed
 majabuuran ilaaj ke liye taiyaar hui ladkighar waalon ke maan jane ke baad ab ladki bhi majabuuran baba se ilaaj karaane ko taiyaar ho chuki thi
 Shilpi immediately gave this news to Asaram over the phone
 asaram kaa phone hameshaa unka nijee sevadaar shiva uthaata he
 He puts the same phone on Baba's ear
 khabar milte hi ladki ko baba ke paas bhejne kii taiyaari shuru ho gai
 The preaching staff assigned to call the girl was given the responsibility to have Baba's discourse in Jodhpur, so that the girl could be called to Jodhpur during the same discourse
 shilpi kii jimmedaari thi ladki ko chhindwara se jodhpur tak laane kii or sharat chand ko kaam diya gaya shilpi or ladki ke jodhpur tak bhejne ke intjaam karne kaa
 After this, Shiva fixed the date of Baba's discourse in Jodhpur on 9, 10 and 11 August
 pravachan kii taarikh tay hote hi ladki ke ghar waalon ko khabar de di gai
 Constantly talking to Asaram, Shilpiye everything happened around August 5
 ab iske baad paanch agast se lekar agle 15 agast tak asaram, shiva, shilpi or sharat chand ke bich har rose lagbhag tees-tees baar phone par baatcheet ho rahi thi
 Before August 5 or after August 15, the four never spoke so often
 pravachan ke baad farm house pahunchaa asaramsari taiyaari puri hote hi asaram jodhpur pahunch gaye
 He completed a three-day lecture
 phir 13 agast ko wo jodhpur se 40 kilometre dur madi gaanv main devda farm house pahunche
 Which they call the hut of solitude
 is bich ladki ke maa-baap bhi jodhpur aa chuke the
 He was then kept in Baba's Pal Ashram in Jodhpur
 ladki mata-pita ke saath pahunchi farm houseudhar, 13 agast ko hi ladki shilpi ke saath chhindwara se jodhpur pahunchati he
 At the railway station, Asaram's personal servant Shiva comes to receive both
 13 agast kii raat ladki apane maa-baap ke saath hi paal ashram main bitaati he
 After this, on the morning of August 14, Shiva reaches the farm house, which is Asaram's confinement, with the girl and her parents
 farm house main baba kaa nijee rasoiyaa prakaash ladki ke liye khaanaa banaata he
 Gives him milk
 phir shaam ko pehali baar baba ladki ke saamne aate hai
 The parents were together
 kuch or bhi log the
 Baba preaches to them
 aashirwad dete hai
 It is then decided that Asaram will treat the girl on August 15
 ekant main ilaaj karne kaa farmaan15 agast ko ladki dopaher ke vakt baba ke saamne hajir kii jaati he
 The parents were still with the girl
 kuch der baba ladki ke maa-baap se baat karte hai
 Then he orders that he will treat the girl in the room alone
 kyonki ilaaj ke liye ekant jaruri he
 On hearing Baba's orders, the girl's parents are removed from the room
 shiva ladki ko baba ke paas puhancha kar pehle hi ja chukaa tha
 Now just near the room was Baba's cook Prakash
 ladki kamare ke andar jaati he or darwaja band ho jaataa he
 Asaram laughed after hypnotizing the girl
 Asaram and the girl were just in the closed room
 ladki ko baba ne pehle sammohit kiya or phir maheenon puraani havas puri kerani shuru kar di
 But perhaps Baba's hypnosis did not affect the girl
 lihaaza wo baba kii ashleel harakat kaa virodh karne lagi
 Then Baba threatened him that if he opened the tongue, his brother and parents studying in Chhindwara Gurukul would be killed
 dhamkee se darkar ladki khamosh ho gai
 The girl was sent back to Shahjahanpur and then the door of the locked room opened after one and a half hours
 ladki chupchaap maa-baap ke saath ekant kutiyaa se baahar ai or shaam ko jodhpur pahunchi phir usee shaam shahjahanpur ke liye nikal gai
 Udha Baba also came out of seclusion on the morning of 16 and left for Delhi via Jodhpur
 jahaan 19 agast se unka pravachan tha
 The victim went home and heard her parents, reached Shahjahanpur in the meantime, and the girl got courage and told her mother everything
 maa ne baap ko bataai or phir puraa parivaar 19 agast ko dilli pahunch gaya
 To meet Baba
 baba se poochne
 But Baba refused to meet
 lihaaza 20 agast koldkine dilli ke kamala market thane main baba ke khilaaf report likhaa di
 And thus Operation 15 came out to everyone
 jisaki vajah se baba kaa asli cheharaa duniya ke saamne aayaa
 And the court sentenced Asaram to life imprisonment for the same black act

 thande or shushk mausam ke kaaran psoriasis (psoriasis) ke marijon kii twachaa par laal rang kii sataha ubharkar saamne aati he or twachaa baar-baar rukhi-sukhi, fatty or bejaan dikhaai detii he
 Psoriasis is an auto-immune condition in which new skin cells begin to form faster than normal
 hamaara sharir har 10 se 30 dinon ke bich twachaa sambandhi nai koshikaayen banaata he, jo puraani koshikaon kii jagah leti hai, jabaki psoriasis rog main nai skin cells kaaphi teji se banati hai, jisase sharir ko puraani skin cells chhodane kaa paryaapt samay nahin miltaa he

 Monica Bambroo has suggested remedies to overcome psoriasis disease in winter
 - moishcharising sabun yaa body wash kaa prayog karen:ek kathor sabun twachaa kii prakritik piech ko badal saktaa he, jisase sukhi twachaa par khujali yaa anya pareshaani bad jaati hai
 Neutral ph level soap or body wash should be used, which retains moisture in the skin and does not dry skin
 body wash kaa istemaal karte hue lupha sabun kaa prayog karne se bachanaa chahie
 Because it can increase your skin discomfort
 - otmil bath:is tarah ke snaan ke liye ek cap otmil lekar ise gunagune pani main daal den
 You can add a few drops of aromatic oil to it
 is gunagunepanise nahaane se aapaki twachaa ko aaraam pahunch saktaa he or shushk, laal daanon yaa chaktton se bhari twachaa, jisase khujali or jalan hoti he ve naram pad jaati he
 When oats come in contact with water, they form a gelatin-like film, which protects the skin and also brings moisture
 nahaate samay twachaa kii ragadkar safai karne se bachein, kyonki isse marij kii twachaa kii khujali or jalan bad jaati he or laal rang kii sataha bhi teji se skin par ubhar sakati he
 - Apply skin cream or moisturizer: Keep your skin full of moisture throughout the day
 iske liye aapako din main do baar skin kriim yaa moshcharizer lagane kii salaah di jaati he
 - Clothing: Woolen clothes can irritate the skin and can cause cracking
 sardiyonke dauraan psoriasis ke rogiyon ko oonee kapadon ke neeche coton ke patale kapade pahanane kii salaah di jaati he
 In this way, they can beat the winter without worrying about the crust
 - dhoop len:sardiyon ke dauraan uchit dhoop nahin milane se, kisi kii twachaa bhi neeras ho sakati he
 Enjoy the sun as much as possible and spend time outdoors
 isse na sirf vitamin di kaa str badhegaa, balki aapkaa mood bhi behatar hoga

 It was the BJP that gave Advani the title of Chhote Sardar and Iron Man
 2013 main jab pratimaa kaa anaavaran hua tha tab bhi adwani vahaan maujuud the
 Several prominent leaders were present at the inauguration of the 'statue of Unity', including Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, BJP President Amit Shah, Madhya Pradesh Governor and former Gujarat Chief Minister Anandi Ben Patel
 lekin gujarat ke gandhinagar se hi saansad adwani kii vahaan gairmaujuudagi par sawaal khadey hona lajimi he
 During the modi-shah era, Advani was included in the bjp's guiding board

 Advani, who has been called the Iron Man of the BJP, became the Home Minister and then the Deputy Prime Minister in the first NDA government
 bijepi ko khadaa karne ke peeche atal-adwani kii jodi ko puraa shrey jaataa he
 Vallabhbhai Patel was also the Home Minister of the first Congress government in Azad India, he was also appointed as the Deputy Prime Minister
 jis tarah sardaar patel apane drudh faislon ke liye jane jate the, usee tarah yah bhi mana jane laga tha ki adwani jo ekbar jo faisle le lete hai us par atal rahete hai
 The people of BJP first gave him the title of Chhote Sardar, later he was also known as Iron Man

 2009 ke chunaav prachaar ke dauraan adwani piem in vatting ke taur par dekhe gaye lekin bijepi jeet nahin saki or upie kii satta main vaapasi hui
 By 2013, Modi had moved ahead after getting the green signal from the Sangh and Advani had to go his own way
 sarkaar banane ke baad unhen maardarshak mandal main laayaa gaya
 Since then, Advani is rarely seen on political platforms
 buudhvaar ko sardaar patel kii murti ke anaavaran ke maukey par adwani nahin dikhe
 Inaugurating the statue, Modi said that i am fortunate to have the opportunity to dedicate this huge statue of Sardar Saheb to the country
 jab maine gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke taur par isaki kalpana kii thi, to kabhi ahsaas nahin tha ki pradhanmantri ke taur par mujhe ye punya kaam karne kaa mauka milegaa
 i am very grateful for the people of Gujarat who have supported me in this work
 lekin log aaj sawaal uthaa rahe hai ki gujarat se hi saansad, modi ko aage badhaane vaale or murti ke shilanyas ke samay modi ke saath deepak jala rahe adwani udghaatan samaaroh main kyon maujuud nahin rahe

 ' The Railway Budget will no longer be presented separately in Parliament for Railways
 rail bajet ko aam bajet main mila diya gaya he
 In this regard, the Cabinet of Modi government approved the proposal on Wednesday
 isi ke saath rail bajet ko sansad main alag se pesh karne kii 92 saal kii parampara khatm ho gai he
 Giving information to reporters about this, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that it has now been decided to include the budget of the Railway Ministry in the general budget itself
 iske peeche jo tark diya ja rahaa he wo he ki kai mantralay aise hai jinka salanaa bajet rail mantralay se zyada yaa baraabar he
 In such a situation, there is no justification for presenting the budget of Ministry of Railways separately
 rail mantralay kii debaray cameti ne iske liye pehle hi suzav diya tha
 According to the finance minister, despite merging the railway budget into the general budget, the functioning of the railway will continue to operate independently as before
 railway alag department kii tarah vanijyik taur par chalaaya jaataa rahegaa
 The railway's autonomy will remain intact and its financial power will remain as it is in the present manner

 The system of dividend paid to the Government of India every year on the capital of 2 lakh 27 thousand crores of the railway has now been abolished
 vitt varsh 2016-17 ke liye bhartiya railway ab koi bhi labhaansh bharat sarkaar ko nahin degaa
 With this, the Railways will continue to receive the gross budgetary support from the Finance Ministry every year
 is tarah railway ko ab har saal takreeban 9700 karod rupee ke labhaansh dene ke vittiya boj se mukt ho gai he
 Significantly, the tradition of presenting a separate railway budget started in 1924
 rail bajet alag se pesh karne ke peeche kii manshaa ye thi ki railway ko us samay alag se baari bharkam rakam kii jarurat thi or puure desh main iskaa aarthik mahatv bahut zyada tha
 The rationale behind the merger of the Railway Budget into the General Budget is that it will help in bringing the Railways to the center stage and will help the Government to formulate a concrete plan about the financial condition of the Railways
 ek badi baat ye he ki rail kiraaya badhaane ke adhikaar ko lekar vitt or rail mantralay ke bich is baat par sahmati he aane vaale dinon main kiraaye main ghat-bad ke liye rail tarriff athurity banaai jaaegi
 Even after the merger of the Railway Budget in the General Budget, the Ministry of Railways will be allowed to announce new trains and projects
 iske alaava railway ke alag alag jones main dm or diarem level par di gai aarthik swytta bhi barkaraar rakhane kii baat kahi gai he

 The monsoon session of the Bihar Legislative Assembly is scheduled to begin on July 28 and just before that the BJP has started the siege of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar over the allegations of corruption against Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav
 bhaajapa ne pehle hi ghoshnaa kar di he vah ki aagaamee monsoon satr ko chalane nahin degaa jab tak tejasvi apane pad se istipha nahin de dete hai
 On the other hand, BJP is also putting pressure on Nitish so that if Tejashwi does not resign himself, the Chief Minister should dismiss him from his cabinet
 isi kram main bhaajapa netaa susheel kumaar modi ne nitish par hamalaa karte hue kaha he ki mukhyamantri kii haalat apahrit vimaan ke payalat jaisi ho gai he
 Modi said that after the formation of the Mahagathbandhan, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad refused to place Nitish on the driving seat of the Grand Alliance and now Lalu wants the Grand Alliance car to be unloaded on the deep pits of corruption
 gauratlab he ki argedy netaa taslimuddin ne 2 din pehle nitish par aakraamak tevar ikhtiyaar karte hue kaha tha ki nitish bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jiro tolerance kii niti kaa gungan aise karte hai maano vah khud doodh ke dhule hon
 On this same statement of RJD MP Taslimuddin, Modi said that to save Tejashwi, RJD is now giving the fiction that corruption continues in government offices in Bihar and this is why talking about zero tolerance against corruption is just a sham
 ek baat to tay he ki is baar bihar vidhansabha kaa monsoon satr kafihangaamedaar rahaneki ashanka he, kyonki bijepi ne ek ore jahaan spasht kar diya he ki jab tak tejasvi yadav apane pad se istipha nahin dete hai vah sadan ko chalane nahin denge, vahiin duusari ore argedy ne bhi saaf kar diya he ki tejasvi kisi bhi keemat par istipha nahin denge
 In such a situation, all eyes are now on Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and information is also being received that Nitish can take a big decision before the monsoon session regarding Kiteshvi
 jishaan kadri aisa katai nahin maanate ki safalataa kismat se milti he
 In this case, he prefers the intentions and efforts more

 When we asked this young director, actor and writer about the success and his journey, what were his answers, you also know
 
 
 1
 Jishan, tell us the meaning of your name first? My name means Pride
 2
 You belong to a family of traditions, where a very disciplined life is lived
 aise main kitna mushkil tha ghar se baahar nikalakar sapane puraa karnaa ?ghar se nikalnaa bahut mushkil tha
 After coming to Mumbai, my father often called me and said, 'why are you spending your time?' Nothing is going to happen to you there phir dhire-dhire meraa kaam aage badha or papa ko yakeen hota gaya ki main sahi raah par hum
 One thing that i would like to tell you is that my little sister has a huge contribution in persuading Dad for my career
 3
 We often have the practice of making a career after school by holding a line
 aise main aapane apni hobbi ko kariyar kaise banaaya or iske liye kya karnaa chahie?iske liye main parents se kahana chahta hum ki apane bacchon par kisi bhi ek line par chalane kaa jor nahin daalen
 The world is changing, not only doctors and engineers are the best
 uske alaava bhi duniya main bahut si chijen karne ke liye hai, jisamen aapke bacchon kaa dil lage, unhen karne de
 4
 ek kariyar ke baad kisi duusare kariyar main shift karne ke phaayde-nuksaan bataaen ?kariyar shift kii baat he to main yahi kahuunga ki aap har samay phaayde or nuksaan ke bare main nahin soch sakate
 If you do not get satisfaction from the work or you feel that your destination is even further, then you should not be harmed in doing other work and moving one step ahead
 5
 Fortune, talent or hard work
 
 
 safalataa kii seedhi chadhane ke liye inako kram se lagaaein ?takadir, talent or mehnat teenon kaa saath hona bahut jaruri he
 Keep talent and keep working hard, your luck will make your way
 6
 When you start giving up, how do you get your courage back? duusare shabdon main kahen to aage badhane kii prerana kahaan se milti he ?haar to aaj tak maani nahin maine
 When your head is obsessed, you do not need any inspiration
 7
 Where would you see yourself if you did not find the field of your choice? Of course i would have been a business man
 8
 What will you say to the youth living in small cities? Make your intentions strong and stick to them completely
 apane kaam main 100 fisadi do, koshish karnaa hameshaa jari rakho
 Doing so will make the way to the floor easier
 9
 You have come from a small place like Dhanbad, how do you feel when you go there after getting success? Is there hope of fulfilling the dreams of the people seeing Jishan there too? Hopefully, hope is awakened! a work which was once known only in the areas of Dhanbad, Wasseypur, today the same name is known internationally as well as India
 sach kahuun to yah sochakar seenaa chaudaa ho jaataa he

 Rural development and panchayati raj can be combined and the Ministry of Tourism and Culture can be abolished, but with changing the face of ministries, the priorities of leaders are also changing

 In this case, this ministry can go to Arun Shourie

 saal 2017 main paak maheene ramajaan kii shuruyaat 27 yaa 28 may se hogi
 If the moon was seen on 26 May, Ramadan would be considered to start from 27 May
 ramadan kaa matlab hota he prakhar
 Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islam calendar
 mana jaataa he ki san 610 main leyalat ul-kadra ke maukey par mohammad sahab ko quran sharif ke bare main pataa chalaa tha
 Just then, this month of Ramadan was celebrated as a holy month
 ramadan ke dauraan ek maheene tak roze rakhe jate hai
 During this time, bad habits are avoided
 nae chand ke saath shuru hue roje 30 din baad nae chand ke saath hi khatm hote he
 Some things have to be taken care of during the fast
 roje ko nibhaane ke liye kai niyam bhi hote hai
 - roze kaa matlab yah nahin he ki aap khaaen to kuch na, lekin khaane ke bare main sochate rahen
 One should not even think about eating during fasting
 islam ke anusaar paanch baaten karne par roza tutaa hua mana jaataa he
 These are five things - slander, greed, evil behind, lie and swear falsely
 roje kaa matlab bas us allaah ke naam par bhukhe-pyaase rahanaa hi nahin he
 During this, fasting of eyes, ears and tongue is also done
 is baat kaa matlab yah he ki na hi to is dauraan kuch bura dekhen, na bura sunen or na hi bura bolen
 The main law of Roja is that Muslims who keep Roja should not eat anything from sunrise to sunset
 roje ke dauraan aurat ke liye man main bure vichaar yaa shaareerik sambandhon ke bare main sochane par bhi manaahi hoti he
 Sahri is an important part of Rosé
 sahari kaa matlab hota he subah
 Roja's rule is to get up and drink daily before the sun comes out
 suraj ugane ke baad rozdaar sahari nahin le sakate
 Iftar, like Sahari, is another important part of Iftar
 sahari ke baad suryaast tak kuch bhi khaane-pine kii manaahi hoti he
 Rosa is opened after the sun sets, called iftar
 ramajaan ke dauraan man ko bhi shuddh rakhana hota he
 One does not have to bring bad thoughts to anyone in the mind and the five times Namaz and Quran are recited
 roje ke dauraan kuch baton kaa vishesh dhyaan rakhana hota he
 There are many rules to follow Roja
 - Lenten does not mean nothing if you eat, but keep thinking about eating
 roje ke dauraan khaane ke bare main sochan bhi nahin chahie
 According to Islam, fasting on five things is considered broken
 ye paanch baaten hai- badanaami karnaa, laalach karnaa, peeth peeche buraai karnaa, jhooth bolnaa or juthi kasam khaanaa
 Roje simply does not mean to stay hungry and thirsty in the name of Allah
 is dauraan aankh, kaan or jeebh kaa bhi roza rakhaa jaataa he
 This means that neither see anything bad, neither listen nor speak bad during this time
 roje kaa mukhya niyam yah he ki rojaa rakhane vaala musalmaan suryoday se lekar suryaast ke dauraan kuch bhi na khaae
 It is also forbidden for a woman to think about bad thoughts or physical relationships in the course of fasting
 sahari, roje kaa ahm hissaa he
 Sahri means morning
 roje kaa niyam he ki suraj nikalne se pehle hi uthakar rozdaar khaanaa-pinaa kare
 After the sun rises, tenants cannot take sahari
 sahari kii hi tarah roje kaa doosraa ahm hissaa he iftaar
 After sahari, eating and drinking anything is prohibited till sunset
 suraj ast ho jane ke baad rojaa kholaa jaataa he, jise iftaar kehete hai
 During Ramadan one also has to keep the mind pure
 man main kisi ke liye bure khyaal nahin laane hote or paanch baar kii namaaz or quran padhi jaati he

 Where have the BJP leaders sacrificed for the country and what have the people of Jana Sangh in the past sacrificed for the country? We should not let these people succeed

 In the eyes of well-known lyricist Javed Akhtar, there is no reason for love, no purpose, just love, and the day the purpose and cause of love is found, love will cease to be that day
 javed akhtar ke anusaar, jab tak kisi kii izzat nahin karte use mohabbat nahin kah sakate, vichaar, jarurat, aakankshaon or aadar ko hi pyaar kehete he
 In which these things do not happen, it is not love
 gulabi nagari jaipur aaye javed akhtar ne mohabbat kii paribhaasha samajhaate hue yah sab bayaan kiya
 He said that what is explained is not love because there is no definition of love, just no matter when, where, whom you can fall in love with, no one can say
 jis kshan pyaar kii paribhaasha ho jaayegi, us vakt pyaar nahin rah jaayegaa
 Lyricist and storyteller Javed Akhtar said, love is not a contract of humans, animals and birds also love, each one has a different style of expression of love, anything can happen in love i
e
 everything is justified in love 
 javed akhtar ne kaha, pyaar, mohabbat ke bina koi ji nahin saktaa, pyaar intahaa hota he, yahi vajah he ki aaj talak pyaar, mohabbat par kabhi shodh nahin hua, kai sadiyon se pyaar kaa silsilaa chal rahaa he, aane vaali sadiyon main bhi pyaar chalata rahegaa kyunki mohabbat junun he bas or kuch nahin
 He said laila-majnu, siri-farhad would have got married if no one remembers them today
 unhen isiilie nahin bhuulaa paye ki unhone pyaar hi kiya vivaah nahin
 Javed Akhtar said that sometimes we consider authority as love, while it is not love, or you can say that we have understood the habit of love, in reality it is only habit, not love
 javed akhtar ne apane niraale andaaj main kaha, yah pyaar or mohabbat hi he jisane aadmi ko jinda rakhaa hua he
 In my view, love is one that has emotion
 agar imoshan nahin he to vah pyaar nahin, kuch or he aisa mujhe lagata he

 congress adhyaksh ke pad ke liye rahul gandhi ne 11 disambar, 2017 ko namakan daakhil kiya tha, iske saath hi unhen party kaa adhyaksh maan liya gaya tha
 However, it was announced five days later, on 16 December
 rahul gandhi ke liye yah ek ittefaq tha, jab thik ek saal baad 11 disambar, 2018 ko congress hindi pattee ke teen rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav jeet kar satta par kabiz hui
 When Rahul Gandhi took over the reins of the party from his mother, Sonia Gandhi, the longest serving president in the history of the Congress, the Congress government was in only four states - Karnataka, Punjab, Mizoram and Puducherry
 unke saamne lagaataar haar se hataash ho chuke congress sanghathan main nai jaan foonkane kii chunauti thi
 Not only this, there was also an unstoppable pair of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah in front
 gujarat chunaav main modi ke chute pasinidhyaksh banane ke baadaraahul gandhike samaksh sabase pehali chunauti gujarat vidhansabha thi
 He was well aware that the morale of the organization is on the ground due to continuous defeat in the state
 iske saath narendra modi or amit shah kaa gruhakshetra hone ke lihaaj se is chunaav ke nateezon se nikalne vaale raajnneetik sandesh ko bhi ve bakhubi samaj rahe the
 Rahul brought the popular youth brigade Hardik Patel, Alpesh Thakor and Jignesh Mevani to a stage in Gujarat
 jis vajah se party ko nai urja mili
 With this, Rahul Gandhi made soft Hindutva his weapon and saw it in monasteries and temples
 haalanki gujarat main congress chunaav haar gai, lekin gramin ilaakon se bijepi kaa lagbhag safaya ho gaya
 Despite the defeat, the Gujarat assembly election results certainly sent a message to the Congress cadre that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not invincible
 karnataka main haari hui baaji paltigujrat ke baad bade rajyon main karnataka ke chunaav hue, jahaan congress kii sarkaar thi
 In the Karnataka elections, the people gave a fractured mandate and the BJP emerged as the single largest party
 lekin rahul ne bada daanv khelte hue jedy (es) ke echdi kumaraswami ko mukhyamantri banane kii peshkash karte hue samarthan kaa elaan kar diya
 However, the Governor invited the BJP to form the government and also administered the oath to BS Yeddyurappa in a hurry
 lekin rahul gandhi kii aguwai main congress haari hui baaji ko palatney par amada thi
 The matter reached the court and late in the night an appeal was made by the Congress against the Governor's decision in which the Congress won
 chunki rajyapal ne yediurppa ko shapath dilaa di thi isliye unhen bahumat sabit karne kaa mauka dena tha
 But due to lack of numbers on the day of majority test, Yeddyurappa gave a walk over and after this dramatic development, the path of the congress-jds government was cleared
 rahul ne is jeet ko mahagathbandhan ke shakti pradarshan ke manch main tabdeel kar diya jisamen sabhi gaiyr endie dalon ke aalaa netaaon ne shirkat kii
 After establishing himself as Modi's challenger, Rahul Gandhi introduced himself as a challenger to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 sansad main tidipi dwaara laae gaye avishvaas prastaav main bahes ke dauraan unhone rafel, notebandi, jiesti, krishi sankat or berogari ko hathiyaar banaate hue piem modi par sidhaa hamalaa kiya
 Along with this, he also started breaching the NDA for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 unhone endie gathbandhan ke bade dal tidipi ko apni taraf laane main kamyaabi hasil kii
 In the Hindi belt states, the major challenge before the Congress, which has been almost clear from the states of North India, important in terms of withdrawal of Congress was to return to Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan
 rahul gandhi ne is chunauti se mukaable ke liye in rajyon main kai guton main bant chuki congress ko ekajute kiya
 While former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh was active behind the scenes in Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath, an expert in political tactics, was given the responsibility of the state organization
 vahiin yuva chehre jyotiraditya sindhiya ko prachaar kii kaman saunpi gai
 Needless to say that Rahul's strategy paid off and these Congress heavyweights in the fort of RSS-BJP gave excellent results in their respective fields
 chhattisgarh main lagbhag netritv viheen ho chuki party kii apratyaashit jeet ke rahul gandhi ne khub mehnat kii
 He started the organization afresh and showed the way out to former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi and his son Amit Jogi and when everyone believed that the Jogi factor would harm the Congress and the BJP would once again come to power
 congress ne do tihaai bahumat hasil kar sabko chaunkaa diya
 The biggest challenge before the Congress which had reached the lowest level in the history of Rajasthan
 rahul ne sachin payalat, ashok gahalot, seepi joshi sareekhe diggajon ko ekajute kiya
 Here too, the Congress returned to power, gaining almost five times the seats of the last election
 stallin ne rahul ko bataaya piem ummidavaartamilnadu main upie kii sahyogi dal diemke ke adhyaksh emke stallin ne us vakt sabko chaunkaa diya jab teen rajyon main congress kii safalataa ko dekhte hue unhone rahul gandhi kaa naam kaa prastaavvipaksh ke piem ummidavaarake taur yah kah kar kiya unamem yah kshamta he ki wo fasivadi bijepi ko haraa sakate hai
 However, TMC, Samajwadi Party did not agree on Stalin's statement and NCP has also said that the PM candidate should not be announced before the election results
 haalanki sharad pavaar yah bhi kah chuke hai ki chunaav ke baad sabase bade dal kaa netaa hi piem hoga
 Not only this, the result of three states, Congress President Rahul Gandhi also got praise from nda's ally Shiv Sena
 shivasena adhyaksh uddhav thakare ne to yahaan tak kah diya ki modi ke ahankaar kii aandhi main rahul apni vinamrata kii badaulat hi tik paae
 However, nothing is definite in politics
 aglalokasabhaa chunaavfinal he, to semifinal main jeet se congress ke hausale buland hai
 Therefore, one year of Rahul Gandhi as Congress President can be called unmatched
 jhabua-ratlam loksabhaa seat se chunaav jite bijepi ke jies damor saansad bane rahenge
 He has decided to resign from the post of MLA
 damor jhabua seat se vidhayak the
 With his announcement, a by-election is now scheduled for the Jhabua assembly seat in Madhya Pradesh
 damor ne pehle vikrant bhuriya ko vidhansabha main haraaya, phir unke pita congress ke diggaj netaa kantilal bhuriya ko loksabhaa main
 Now there will be a by-election in Jhabua Assembly seat of Madhya Pradesh because BJP has decided that GS Damor, elected from this seat will move to Delhi, depart from Bhopal
 madhyapradesh bijepi adhyaksh rakesh singh ne kaha ki jies damor vidhansabha kii sadsyta se istipha denge, saansad bane rahenge
 By-elections were held as soon as Damore won the Lok Sabha elections
 damor jhabua ke vidhayak hai or phir saansad bhi chun liye gaye
 According to the rule, in such a situation, one seat has to be left within 14 days of winning the election
 congress ko lagata he ab vah ek or vidhayak badha legi
 Congress spokesperson Narendra Saluja says that 'the Congress is definitely ready
 is upachunaav main baari bahumat se jeetenge, kyonki yah upachunaav rajya sarkaar ke kaam par he
 Whether it is debt waiver or the welfare of tribal class, talk about employment of youth, we will get the benefit of this
 'is seat par charchaa rajya main siyaasi ganit ke liye jaruri he kyonki loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ke 303 saansad hai
 While the BJP had 109 mlas in the 230-seat assembly, it now has 108
 congress ke 114 vidhayak hai
 Currently he has 121 figures with four independents, two BSP and one SP MLA
 yani bijepi ab agar pradesh main sarkaar banane kii koi chaal chalati he to use saat nahin aath vidhayak chahie
 However, the BJP is still saying that it will not topple the government
 bijepi pradeshdhyaksh rakesh singh ne kaha 'aap andaja laga lijie uske baavjood ham bahut aaraam se hai, madhyapradesh vidhansabha main
 We never talked about toppling the government, even today we are saying the same thing
 congress kii sarkaar tabadalaa main lagi hui he, swany ke antarvirodh se giregi, hamaara giraane kaa koi iraadaa nahin he
 The jhabua-ratlam seat is considered the third stronghold of the Congress in the state
 lekin 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi ke dilip singh bhuriya ne congress ke kantilal bhuriya ko haraa diya
 After the by-elections were held after the death of Dilip Singh, Kantilal again became an MP
 ab jhabua vidhansabha jeetna bijepi ke liye bahut aasaan nahin hoga kyonki uske paas is seat par vikalp bahut zyada nahin hai
 According to this report of The Indian Express, Amit Shah said, 'congress is not a party based on one ideology, based on one principle, it is a special purpose vehicle to achieve independence, to achieve independence

 Bringin a Bangladeshi actor to campaign for an Indian election is the proof for the fact- how much Bangladeshi infiltration @mamataofficial has aided just for hr vote bank
 Looks like she clearly didn't expect any support frm Indian Muslims so she had to import thm frm bangladeshboylivuda produsar ashok pandit (ashoke Pandit) ne likhaa: "bangladeshi actor ko bhartiya chunaav main prachaar main laana yah siddh karata he ki mamata banerjee (mamata Banerjee) bas apane vot bank ke liye kitni sankhya main bangladeshi ghuspaithiyon (bangladeshi infiltration) kii madad kar rahi hai
 It seems as if she is not expecting support from Indian Muslims, so she is bringing it from Bangladesh

 This tweet of Ashok Pandit is going viral

 Both of them made their pawn to send mail to two school students of Kishtwar, Abid Hussain and Shariq Ahmed
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki sandeshaa bhejne waalon kii gardan pakadaney vaali enie dhamaakaa karne vaale asli haathon ko kab pakad paati he
 And will the NIA be able to bring forth the face of that terrorist named Indian Mujahideen, who despite all the arrests is going on doing one terrorist attack after another
 aatankwaadi hamalaa desh main hi jaden jamaa chuke aatankwaadi network kaa kaam he, is baat ko khud grih mantri pi chidambaram bhi maan chuke hai
 Intelligence agencies have been giving the name of Indian Mujahideen to this homegrown terrorist network for almost four years and after the arrest of all its alleged dons in 2008, the atmosphere was created that IM had broken
 lekin mumbai or dilli main hue taaja hamalon ne yahi dikhaaya ki iem naam kaa yah jinn bottle main kabhi gaya hi nahin tha
 IM is more organized and powerful than before
 yah baat alag he ki aatank ke is saaye kii sahi tasviir kisi ke paas nahin he
 On the contrary, there have been many cases in which it was alleged that after picking up the innocent boys, the police tagged the IM label on them
 iem ko lekar faili theoriyon or giraftaar-faraari ke sutron ke ird-gird india today ne yah pataa karne kii koshish kii ki agar 2008 main pratibandhit studants islamic movement of india (simi) or iem ke safadar nagauri, abu bashar kaashmi, qayamuddin kapaadiya or mansoor pirbhoy sahit darjan bhar se adhik sarganaon ko police ne giraftaar kar liya or riyaj bhatkal, yaccin bhatkal, aamir raja khan, abdul subhaan kuraishi, shaadaab malik or mohsin choudhary jaise shaatir pakistan bhaagane main kaamyaab rahe, to ab desh main koun iem kii kaman sambhaal rahaa he or inaki nai ranneeti kya he
 Intelligence agencies claim that when SIMI was banned for the first time in September 2001, many members of its fundamentalist faction formed IM along with harkat-ul-jihad-e-islami (huji) and some youths from Uttar Pradesh, whom lashkar-e-taiba has a patronage
 lekin 2008 ke mumbai visphoton ke baad simi-iem ke sakriy sadasyon kii giraftaar ke baad iem kaaphi kamjor hua tha, par ab yah phir sir uthaa rahaa he
 The former head of IB

 "it is a misconception that most of the people of IM were arrested in 2008," says Doval
 darasal jitne log giraftaar hue usase kahin zyada log faraar hai
 Despite the strictness of the intelligence agencies, the terrorists who have fled to Pakistan are not only in touch with their Indian modules, but also keep coming to India through secretly different routes
 '' is daawey kii pushti is saal 26 june ko simi ke ek purv adhyaksh saiyad salauddin salaar kii giraftaar se hui he
 Salar was arrested by the Madhya Pradesh ATS from the Kochi Airport when he landed here on a Dubai flight
 sampradayik tanaav failaane ke ek maamle main lambey samay se uski talash thi
 The arrest of Iqrar Sheikh, which took place on June 5 this year, also revealed that India's terrorist module is in touch with the terrorists hiding in Pakistan
 ikraar shaikh ko ahmedabad visphot kaa pramukh aaropee bataaya jaataa he
 a chemical engineer by profession, Sheikh is an expert in making explosive materials and is the right hand man of im's leader Abdul Subhan Qureshi, who is considered the 'brain' of the blasts in Mumbai's local trains and the blasts in Ahmedabad, Delhi and Bangalore
 is saal may or june main police ke hathe chadhe kuch aatankiyon se poochtacha main pehali baat to yah saaf hui ki pakistan bhaag gaye aatankwaadi vahaan rahakar bharat ke aatankwaadi network ke liye kaam kar rahe hai
 Secondly, IM, which has remained silent since the 2008 Mumbai blasts, has spread a large net of sleeper sales in the country during this period
 khufia agenciyon ko isi saal ab tak 106 sleeper cell or kareeb 400 iem sadasyon ke desh main sakriy hone kii jaankaree mili he
 The Madhya Pradesh ATS has gone a step ahead and has disclosed 5 cases in which terrorists have committed robbery for funding
 pradesh ke ratlam, jabalpur or bhopal main giraftaar aatankwaadiyon ne bataaya ki pichley do saal main unhone devas, itarasi tathaa mandsaur jile main piplia mandi or jaavara ke bainkon se 12 lakh ru
 Have robbed more than
 unhone agast 2010 main bhopal main manappuram gold finance company se 2 karod ru
 Robbed of gold jewelery aatankwaadiyon kii nishandehi par jharkhand ke tatanagar main 1
 25 crores Rs
 ke sone ke aabhushan baraamad bhi kiye gaye
 It is not that theft and robbery is the only method of funding left, if Doval believes that terrorists are suspected of getting money from foreign organizations too
 inamen saudi arab ke kai sanghathan, international brotherhud, world essembly of muslim yuths, indonesia kaa al jamaayiya, morocco or philippines ke kuch sanghathan bhi shaamil hai
 At the same time, money is reaching terrorists through Indians settled in Gulf countries
 yani iem aatankwaad ke antarrashtriya network ke sampark main he
 The inclusion of new terrorists in the terror module is also being done very carefully now
 institute for canaflict management ke kaaryakari nideshak ajay saahani bataate hai ki ab kisi masjid kii takreer ke jariye aatankwaadiyon kii bhartee karnaa mushkil he
 Now such people are being sorted, whose blood soon fades on the alleged atrocities on Muslims
 kuch maheene se lekar kuch saal tak ke vakt main aise yuvaaon ko iem main shaamil kar aatanki vaardaat karne ke liye har tarah se daksh kar diya jaataa he
 They also have highly educated people
 aatankwaadi recruitment or network kii taaja misaal madhya pradesh aties ke khulaase main hui he
 According to the police, the terrorists arrested in June this year have a significant interference in information technology
 ye sab noujvaan hai or khud kii pahchaan chaatr ke rup main hi karaate hai
 cds, pen drives, driving licenses and many fake documents were found from them
 ratlam se pakade gaye jakir naam ke aatankwaadi ne to sadik ke naam se farji yuidi card tak banavaa liya tha
 In the presence of these documents, he did not face any problem in buying a new SIM card
 july 2011 main mumbai bam dhamaake ke sambandh main gujarat aties ne ek aatankwaadi ko ahmedabad main giraftaar kiya
 On his spot, a suspect was arrested from Rath town in Mahoba district of Uttar Pradesh
 raath kaa naam iske pehle kabhi aatankwaadi vaardaat se nahin judaa
 IM has extended its network to a town where there is no rail network
 mumbai dhamaake ke taar madhya pradesh ke itarasi se bhi jude bataae ja rahe hai
 How the terrorist network is spreading like cancer was also revealed by the arrest of 8 terrorists of Madhya Pradesh ATS on 5 June this year
 giraftaar aatankiyon main ikraar shaikh or abu faijal sahit simi ke 5 or indian mujahidin ke teen sadsy hai
 According to the ATS, Faizal admitted that he had relationships with Riyaz Bhatkal and Ejaz Bhatkal
 police ke kasate shikanje ke bich aatankwaadiyon ne aapas main samvaad ke tareeke bhi badale hai
 Sahni says that terrorists are communicating secretly through encrypted messages, hidden messages in the picture, and even pornographic (pornographic) content
 ashleel saamagree bhejne kii peeche manshaa yah he ki inhen agenciyaan gambhirtha se nahin lengin
 Says Namrata Goswami, Senior Fellow, who is researching IM at the Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis (IDSA), "the Human Courier is currently the most trusted weapon of terrorists
" koi aadmi chupchaap aakar kisi se mila or chalaa gaya
 There is no record of this
 mahatvapurn sandeshon or planning main aatankwaadi yahi tarika apana rahe hai
 Women have also been engaged in this work
 gauratlab he ki pakistan main america agenciyon ke haathon maaraa gaya osama bin laden courier kaa hi istemaal kar rahaa tha
 But another reason for IM being strong cannot be ignored
 yah vajah he aatankwaad ke aarope main tamaam aise logon ko giraftaar kiya janaa jinke aatankwaad main shaamil hone ko lekar vivaad he
 14 prominent terrorists have been arrested in the last five years in connection with terrorism from Azamgarh town of Uttar Pradesh, which has been maligned as a stronghold of terror
 inamen se kai logon par ungali uthaate hue pipuls union for civil liberty (piusiel) kii uttar pradesh ikai ke sanyukt sachiv masihuddin sanjri ne kaha, ''aparaadh kaa faisla to adaalat karegi lekin kai giraftaareyon main tathyon ko tod-marodakar pesh kiya gaya
 Abu Bashar, who is being described as the mastermind of the 2008 Ahmedabad blasts, was picked up by the police from Azamgarh on 14 August but his arrest was shown from Lucknow on 16 August 2008
 is maamle main 16 agast se pehle hi supreme court ko ek fax kar bashar ko azamgarh se uthaane kii shikaayat darj karai gai
 This fax is in the Supreme Court records
 '' unhone bataaya ki lakhanu or faijabad dhamaakon ke aaropee peshey se doctor tarik kaasmi or khalid mujahid tathaa jaipur dhamaake ke silsile main giraftaar mohammad sarwar kii giraftaar main bhi isi tarah kii gadbady pari gai he
 Not only this, according to information received by India Today, nine youth of Azamgarh are absconding for a long time
 inamen se kuch par 52 mukademe tak darj hai
 The local police have no clue about them and their families say their children are missing
 is tarah ke maamle iem ke sanghathan kii shakl ko saaf karne ke bajaae or ulajhaa rahe hai
 However, Doval believes that intelligence agencies take a lot of precaution in terrorist cases and the incident of picking up the wrong person will be rare
 kuch aisi hi ehtiyaat pakistan bhi barat rahaa he, lekin uskaa makasad kuch or he
 Pakistan does not want any piece of it to be beaten directly on the board of terror and its wazir in the panchayat of America will give a clean explanation
 parade ke peeche se aatank kii bhatti main tel chhidakane kii paak kii dohari niti par saahani kehete hai, ''teen-chaar saal se pakistan par antarrashtriya dabaav bad gaya he
 In such a situation, the ISI is unable to provide arms and ammunition to the terrorists as before
 yahi vajah he ki pichley kuch saal main bharat main hue zyaadaatar visphot lo intecity ke the or inamen ardex kii bajaae aasaani se uplabdh ammonium nitrate istemaal hua
 The militants have generally been getting RDX from the Pakistani Army, but since the 2008 attack on Mumbai, the Pakistan Army wants to keep distance
 isliye vah iem ko is tarah majboot karnaa chahta he ki vah khantee bhartiya aatankwaadi sanghathan dikhe
 However, PETN explosives were used in the latest attacks on Mumbai and Delhi, which are usually with the army
 yah tathy paak sena kii ranneeti main badlaav kaa ishaara karata he
 With a big bang, IM has not proved that the intelligence agencies are not able to function properly or that they lack resources
 Sahani says about this, "in all the small towns where terrorists are spreading their network, do we really have intelligence officers to monitor that level?" If all the intelligence is combined, there will be barely 15,000 officers for field intelligence in the country
 vaise bhi khufia agenciyon ke paas aatankwaad ke alaava bhi bahut-si jimmedaariyaan hai
 These include political, economic and criminal intelligence
 '' dilli se sate loni thane main 15 lakh kii aabaadi par khufia jaankaree jutaney ke liye mahaj teen pulisavaale hai
 Doval believes that the number of intelligence officers in the country is not small, but keeping watch on terrorism is his first priority, there are many questions about this
 unka to yahaan tak maananaa he ki pota khatm hone ke baad se police aatankwaadiyon se sakhti se poochtacha nahin kar paati he
 But the real thing is that there are major terrorist incidents in the country and people are feeling insecure
 us par iem naam kaa vah rahasyamay sanghathan jiske mukhiya kaa naam daawey ke saath koi nahin jaanata, desh ke chappe-chappe main sleeper cell kii barudi surang bichhaata ja rahaa he jinhen khodne ke pher main kabhi kamyaabi milti he to kabhi suraksha agenciyon ke haath jhulas jate hai
 In such a situation, the question is whether the government will strengthen the intelligence system so much that the roots of the Terror Tree can be planted or the government's thinking is limited to increasing the compensation of death according to inflation
