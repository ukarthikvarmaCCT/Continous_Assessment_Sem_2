 These sons of Mother India sacrificed their lives on their motherland, wishing for Sarfaroshi
 unka jajba aaj bhi yuvaaon ke liye ek sikh he
 India became independent, but still this country could not become what Bhagat Singh wanted
 shahid-e-ajam ko shat shat naman! shaheed-e-azam, congratulations! aaj id (eid) bahut hi dhoomdhaam se manaai ja rahi he

 com / b2jbhc8zyo a heartbreaking case has surfaced in London, where a thief was caught entering a morgue and having a relationship with the body of a woman
 yuvak ko 6 saal ke liye jail bhej diya gaya he
 Hearing in a Birmingham court, the judge expressed grief over the incident, saying that the act done by Kasim Khurram was an incident hurting all human sensibilities
 police ne bataaya ki jis vakt yuvak ko giraftaar kiya gaya us samay vah na sirf sharaab ke nashe main dhutt tha balki usne kritrim bhaang kaa seven bhi kiya hua tha
 The local court has convicted the 23-year-old youth on charges of having a relationship with the body
 sunwaayee ke dauraan jaankaree saamne ai ki 3 shav ko kshat-vikshat kiya gaya or 9 tabuton ko tod diya gaya
 During the hearing, the judge said that you mistreated 9 bodies
 aapane unke saath kya kiya or kyon kiya, ye sirf aap hi jaanate hai
 The lawyer of the convicted youth said that Khurram is ashamed of his actions
 may maheene kii paanch taarikh kii shaam ko priyanka gandhi wadra amethi se dilli ke liye ravaanaa huin
 Priyanka met some of the party's block and booth level workers at the Fursatganj airstrip before boarding a private flight to Delhi
 22 april ko congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne amethi main apana parchaa bharaa tha or usee din se priyanka ke saath padaav daale baithe congress netaa captain satish sharma bhi vahaan maujuud the
 Priyanka told party workers that she was upset with the way bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi targeted her father Rajiv Gandhi at the Gauriganj meeting that day
 priyanka ne kaha, ‘‘main yahaan aapke saath rahanaa chaahati hum, lekin chunaav aachaar samhita mujhe isaki ijaajat nahin detii, lekin mujhe yakeen he ki voting ke samay aap modi ko karaara jawaab denge
 When a passionate Congress worker asked when she would return, Priyanka replied that she would come soon after the election
 amethi se block congress adhyaksh brijendra shukla ne bataate hai, ‘‘inaki vajah se ham congress ko vot dete hai
 i agree that it is a matter of family
 lekin inke (priyanka ke) aane se fark padataa he
 The manner in which Priyanka's dastardly attack on Modi's attacks has shook the BJP and the way she dominated television's prime time shows that perhaps not only Amethi or Rae Bareli, but other Congress workers too instead of Rahul Priyanka likes to join the family more
 loksabhaa 2014 ke liye congress ke prachaar kaa makasad rahul ko is sabase puraani party ke netaa pad par sthapit karnaa tha, lekin 16wein aam chunaav ke ant tak aate-aate zyada karishmai priyanka apane bhai ke vikalp ke rup main ubhari hai
 Often, his comparison and aggressive style with his grandmother Indira has added to Rahul's problems because he was already losing ground in terms of thinking and image compared to Modi
 congress ke prachaar ke kuch kendriya mudde the-yuva netaa ke rup main rahul gandhi kii pahchaan, sampradayik raajnneeti kaa virodh or upie ke ghotaale vaali chhavi se duuri
 He was elevated as a leader who would usher in new inclusive politics by encouraging youth power in the face of the hardline thinking of the Sangh-backed BJP
 yuva shakti kaa nishaanaa pehali baar ke das karod matadaataaon par tha, jabaki kattarta ke virodh ke nishane par bijepi kii dharmanirpekshata virdohi saakh thi
 This message found a new medium borrowed from the US presidential election
 yah madhyam logon ko sambodhit karne kii rahul kii kam sfoort or zyada samvaad vaali style ke liye upyukt tha
 The chief strategist of his team, Mohan Gopal, held meetings in a townhall style, in which Rahul kept listening to people in small groups instead of speaking
 unke shabdon main is sari kavayad kaa bada makasad yah sandesh un 70 karod bharatiyon tak pahunchaana tha, jo garibi rekha se upar hai, lekin abhi madhyam varg kaa hissaa nahin bane hai
 On one hand, Modi continued to serve politics of hope and progress, on the other hand Rahul kept poverty as an enemy that needed to be kept away with the help of government help
 manaregaa or khaadya suraksha jaisi kalyankari yojanaon ke prachaar ke liye lagane vaale naare, jaise ‘‘puri roti khaaenge, sau din kaam karenge or congress ko jitaayenge,’’ us yuva varg main beasar sabit ho rahe the
 On the one hand there is a hunger for opportunity, on the other, there is resentment from the current government for policy inaction, poor management of the economy, widespread corruption and automatically acceptable failure to generate employment
 jaahir he, yah sandesh sarkaar se voter kii apekshaaon ke anuroop nahin tha
 Rahul seems to have made a mistake in studying the concerns of the newly emerging aspiring class, who are looking for employment instead of free food
 isliye ve yuvaaon ke vaise pratik nahin ban paae, jaisaa ki modi se kam umr hone kii vajah se bananaa chaahate the
 The slogan that bjp's prime ministerial candidate gave priority to development over every issue, including caste and community, attracted the youth
 rahul ne jab apane yaar-doston ko badhaava dene vaale kathith poonjeevaad or adani samooh ke udai ke aaropon se modi ko gherne kii koshish kii, to ve bhi koyala block or 2ji spectrum aavanton main upie ke ghotaalon ke boj se batch nahin sake
 The way the BJP and the Adani group denied their allegations sequentially has added to the Congress' credit crisis
 isse bhi bura yah hua ki ekajute sandesh sidhaa voter tak pahunchane ke liye juujhati party ko 500 karod ru
 The traditional media publicity stance of the JS had to be changed in the middle which caused confusion among the people
 congress kaa prachaar, rahul hamaare netaa hai’’ or ‘‘modi tabaahi laaenge’’ jaise naaron ke bich jhulata rahaa
 Rahul appeared in a TV interview in the last fortnight of January, while the party released advertisements focusing on him in newspapers and television
 is tarah kaa pehla vigyaapan 20 janvari ko aayaa, jisamen naaraa tha-‘‘rahul ji ke nau hathiyaar, dur karenge bhrashtachar’’
 When this slogan started being copied on social media, the party started giving it a more anti-modi color than a Rahul supporter
 ‘‘kattar soch nahin, yuva josh’’ or ‘‘har haath shakti, har haath tarakkee’’ jaise naaron ke nishane par modi kii hindutvvaadi chhavi thi
 They were attacked for keeping the minorities out of the purview of development in Gujarat, calling the Gujarat model wrong
 uske baad ek naaraa laga, ‘‘main nahin ham’’, isamen rahul ko samaaj ke nichle tabakon ke saath dikhaaya gaya
 There was a noise that this slogan was adopted in the bjp's Chintan Shivir in 2011 and is an imitation of the same
 kuch varisht congressi netaaon ko laga ki sab thik chal rahaa he, lekin tabhi rahul kaa pehla tivi intervyuu prasaarit ho gaya
 a senior leader told that, "this one interview caused more harm than any incident in the last one or two years
 ’’ vigyaapan, intervyuu ke turant baad aae or log shaayad tab bhi netaa ke rup main unki haisiyat talash rahe the
 Out of the purview of the advertisements, the party's message in mid-april raised the slogan that Sonia was the only surveyee, but by the end of April, Priyanka was seen as the party's new hope
 vigyapanon main tasviir ab bhi rahul kii thi, lekin 14 april ko jis tarah congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne apane sandesh ke jariye matadaataaon se sampradayik shaktiyon ko dur rakhane kaa aagrah kiya, use modi ke kaaphi had tak sakaaratmak sandeshon kaa jawaab dene kii hataash koshish ke rup main dekha gaya
 While Rahul was busy with his townhall meetings in March, the scope of Priyanka's role as chief strategist also expanded
 rahul gandhi kaa prachaar prabandhan karte-karte ve party ke liye prachaar ranneeti sanbhaalane lageen or aakhirkaar kaaphi had tak use tay karne lageen
 The way Priyanka responded to Narendra Modi, the BJP was shaken badly
 rahul ne ab apni bahan se kuch sabak sikhkar varanasi main road sho karne kaa faisla kiya
 In Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's little time for campaigning in Amethi and Rae Bareli, she uncharacteristically dominated Rahul
 unhone virodhiyon ko munh tod jawaab die or chunavi jang modi tathaa unke bich tabdeel hoti najar ai
 In the media and everywhere, discussions on Modi started becoming common
 lekin is chunavi jang kaa rukh varanasi kii taraf mudiye ke saath hi yah ladaai phir modi banaam rahul ho gai
 So far, Congress Vice President Rahul has raised himself as someone who will overcome frustration, while Narendra Modi has emerged as a ray of hope
 yah puraane bharat kii soch banaam nae bharat kii aakankshaon ke bich kii jang he
 Everyone has thrown their full strength
 lekin 16 may ko hi rahul or desh yah jaan paaegaa ki koun-sa sandesh apni manzil tak pahunchaa he

 Such concocted news of Misa has been rejected by Harvard University
 uniwarsity ne apane bayaan main kaha ki 7-8 march ko hui india conference main misa bharti ko spikar ke taur par nahin bulaayaa gaya tha
 News and photos printed in newspapers are a means of fake propaganda
 uniwarsity ne apni ore se ek statement jari kar kaha he kimisa bharatishrota ke taur par ain thim or vah harvard main spikar ke taur par india conference kii kisi panel kaa hissaa nahin thi
 Along with this, Harvard also said that the presence of Misa Bharti can be traced to the fact that she bought the ticket as a listener
 unhen bhaashan dene ke liye nahin bulaayaa gaya tha
 The university's statement came after the conference's organizing committee saw that Misa Bharti was spreading fabricated information by uploading some pictures on social media
 aayojan samiti ke mutabik misa bharti ne conference khatm hone ke baad avaidh tareeke se stage par jaakar photo khinchvaai or media main jari kar diya

 haal hi main jab samira dilli ai, to unhone apni is film ke bare main khul kar bolaa
 Tell me something about your film? This film is based on Naxalism
 kis tarah se log naksalwad ke chalate apane jivan ko ji nahin pate or pareshaaniyon kaa saamana kar dar dar kar jite hai
 This is what we want to show people through this film
 film ko sin karne ke peeche kya vajah rahi, kya aap apni image badalanaa chaahati thim yaa phir kuch or?image badalane kii koi baat nahin
 i have never been tied in an image
 or phir main yahaan kaam karne ai hum, isliye koshish yahi karti hum ki har tarah ke kirdaar nibhaa sakuun
 Red alert explains why people become naxalites
 is film ne meri image badali yaa nahin yah to main nahin jaanati, lekin haa vyaktigat taur par isane film ke dauraan maine khud main bahut badlaav mahasoos kiye hai
 What kind of changes? i did not know much about Naxalism before red alert, but after saying yes to the film, i did research at my level and found that Naxalism is a serious problem
 red alert main aap kis tarah kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahi hai?is film main main ek lakshmi kaa naam kii ladki kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahi hum, jiskaa police stesan main balaatkaar hota he
 Later, she joins the Naxalites due to lack of justice
 res main ek naasamajh ladki kaa kirdaar or red alert kii naksali ladki main se koun sa kirdaar nibhaana kathin rahaa?kirdaar to donon hi mushkil the
 Even if you are educated, you look foolish as if you don't know anything
 or phir jangalon main jaakar bandook uthaanaa vaaki mushkil rahaa
 Any major reason for choosing serious films? Yes, there is one
 vah ye ki log ab gambhir filmein bhi pasand karne lage hai or red alert ek behad gambhir vishay par bani he
 And then the script of the film attracted me a lot, because it raises a very serious issue
 dedh saal pehle tak mujhe naksali samasya ke bare main pataa nahin tha
 Now i want to do something to help them

 '' After demonetisation in the country, the responsibility of Income Tax Department has increased more than ever
 sarkaar ho yaa samaaj har koi is vibhaag kii ore aashaa bhari najaron se dekh rahaa he, lekin aap yah sunakar achraj main pad jaaenge ki is vibhaag main adhikari va karmchaariyon kii sankhya kitni he, iskaa byoraa vibhaag ke paas hi nahin he
 Demonetisation was announced in the country on November 8, among the promises made by the government, there is also a promise to bring out black money
 sarkaar ke is vaade ke puraa karne kii sabase ahm jimmedaari iskar vibhaag par he, kyonki yahi vibhaag bank khaaton main jamaa rakam se lekar aay se adhik sampatti par najar rakhkar karrwai karne vaala vibhaag he
 The information of the department under the Right to Information is shocking
 madhyapradesh ke neemuch jile ke nivasee soochna ke adhikaar ke kaaryakarta chandrashekhar goud ne kendriya pratyaksh kar board (sibiditi) se jaananaa chaha tha ki vibhaag main kul kitne adhikari va karmchaaree karyrat hai, kitna main power kam he or beete paanch varshon main kitni sankhya main karmchaaree va adhikari sevanivrutt hue hai or uske evaj main kitni niyuktiyaan hui hai
 Details of this should be given
 goud ko chaar agast 2016 ko kendriya lok soochna adhikari iskar vibhaag (echaradi) pradeep ne jo jawaab bheja usamen kaha gaya, "aapane jo jaankaree chaahi he vah unke karyaalay main uplabdh nahin he
 " yahaan bataanaa lajimi hoga ki desh main netbandi se pehle iskar vibhaag ke paas jo jimmedaariyaan thim, vah to ab bhi he, vahiin notebandi ke elaan ki baad uski jimmedaari or bhi bad gai he
 Now he will also have to find out how many bank accounts have come to more than 2
5 lakhs after demonetisation
 goud ne bataaya, "centre sarkaar kar sangrah badhaane kii baat karti he, yah thik bhi he magar unke dimag main ek sawaal bhi tha ki kya sarkaar kii manshaa ko puraa karne ke liye vibhagamen paryaapt stoff he bhi yaa nahin
 To know this fact, information was sought under Right to Information
 jo jaankaree ai he vah achraj main daalane vaali he
 " iskar vibhaag main karmchaariyon or adhikariyon kii kami he, yah baat iskar karmchaaree mahasang ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh yashavanth purohit ne charchaa karte hue sweekaari
 He told, "there are a total of 70 thousand posts in the Income Tax Department in the country, but currently only about 48 thousand employees are employed, thus the posts of more than 23 thousand employees are vacant
 "tippaniyan He further says that it is true that his work has increased after demonetisation, but he has to contend with shortage of staff
 ve maanate he ki karmchaaree sevanivrutt to ho rahe hai, lekin us anupaat main bhartee nahin ho paa rahi he
 On one hand, the department does not have the details of the number of employees, on the other hand the recruitment process is slow, in such a situation, questions are being raised about how the department will be able to fulfill its increased responsibility and fulfill the government's intention
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) desh main notebandi kaa elaan aath november ko kiya gaya, sarkaar ne jo vaade kiye hai, unamem kalaadhan baahar laane kaa bhi ek vaada he
 The most important responsibility of fulfilling this promise of the government lies with the Income Tax Department, because this department is the department to monitor and take action from the amount deposited in bank accounts to disproportionate assets
 soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat vibhaag kii jaankaree chaunkaane vaali he
 Chandrasekhar Gaur, a right to information activist, resident of Neemuch district of Madhya Pradesh, wanted to know from the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) how many officers and employees are employed in the department, how much manpower is less and how many employees in the last five years And the officers are retired and how many appointments have been made in lieu of that
 iskaa byoraa diya jaae
 On August 4, 2016, the Central Public Information Officer Income Tax Department (HRD) Pradeep sent to Gaur saying, "the information you have sought is not available in his office
" " It would be necessary to tell here that the responsibilities that the Income Tax Department had before Netabandi in the country are still there, but after the announcement of demonetisation, its responsibility has increased even more
 ab use yah bhi pataa lagaana hoga ki notebandi ke baad kitne bank khaaton main dhaai lakh se zyada kii rakam ai he
 Gaur said, "the central government talks about increasing tax collection, this is fine, but there was a question in their mind as to whether there is enough staff in the department to fulfill the government's intention
" isi hakeekat ko jaanane ke liye soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat jaankaree maangi thi
 The information that has come out is surprising
 " There is a shortage of employees and officers in the Income Tax Department, while accepting this, Yashwant Purohit, National Vice President of Income Tax Employees Federation
 unhone bataaya, "desh main iskar vibhaag main kul 70 hajaar pad he, magar vartmaan main lagbhag 48 hajaar karmchaaree hi karyrat he, is tarah 23 hajaar se zyada karmchaariyon ke pad rikt he
 "comments ve aage kehete hai ki, yah baat sahi he ki notebandi ke baad unka kaam badha he, magar karmchaariyon kii kami se unhen jujhna pad rahaa he
 They believe that the employees are retiring, but that ratio is not being admitted
 ek taraf vibhaag ke paas karmchaariyon kii sankhya kaa byoraa nahin he to duusari ore bhartee prakriya dhimi he, aise main vibhaag apni badi jimmedaari ko bakhubi kaise nibhaa paaegaa or sarkaar kii manshaa kaise puri hogi, yah sawaal uthne lage hai

 BJP president Amit Shah said that i had appealed in the assembly that i want to form the government from the seats of Amethi in UP
 meri is apil ko amethi kii janata ne puraa kiya
 The people of Amethi helped us by winning four seats out of five
 shah ne kaha ki maine pehali baar dekha ki jeeta hua pratyaashee janata kaa haal na le or haara hua pratyaashee kshetra main vikaas kaa kaam karen
 Smriti Irani offers this example
 shah ne kaha ki amethi kii dharti se congress ke shahjade se poochna chahta hum ki teen teen peedi ko yahaan kii janata ne vot kiya
 You ask for a three-year account from the Modi government, i ask you for the account of three generations

 Why the hospital TB unit did not start
 shah ne kaha ki desh main do prakaar ke vikaas kaa model he, gandhi nehru parivaar kaa model or ek modi kaa vikaas kaa model
 You are well aware of the model of Gandhi Nehru family

 Shah said that the Modi government has brought more than 106 schemes for youth, women, tribals and poor in three years
 iske baad amit shah ne yojanaon ko padhanaa shuru kar diya
 Shah said that it seems that Rahul Baba does not get a count of 106, so he asks questions
 rahul poochhate hai ki hamane kya kaam kiya to ham bataa rahe hai ki rahul baba hamane sabase pehle bolne vaala piem dene kaa kaam kiya
 On the surgical strike, Shah said that the Modi government avenged the Uri terror attack with a surgical strike
 aisa pehle kabhi nahin hua tha

 In UP, no one will let anyone grab the land of farmers in the name of foundation
 yogi ne kaha ki bijepi kii amethi kii raily ke dar se rahul gandhi ne kuch din pehle apane kshetra kaa daura kiya
 Speaking at the rally, MP Smriti Irani made many attacks on Rahul in his speech
 unhone kaha ki saadhe teen saal pehle main amethi ai to yahaan party ke kaaryakartaaon ne man se swaagat kiya
 The biggest good fortune of my life is that i came to the party as an activist and today i have become a sister of Amethi
 irani ne rahul par waar karte hue pipari gaanv kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki is sansadeey kshetra ke log unase mil nahin sakate hai
 Irani said that on hearing Amethi's name, snakes are sniffed at those people who roam across the country and say that there is no development
 smriti ne kaha ki amethi main jo saath saal main nahin ho paaya vah yogi sarkaar ne 7 maheene main kar dikhaaya
 Smriti said that Congress has seen Amethi only through the eyes of votes
 smriti ne kaha ki nehru, indira or rajeev gandhi ne oonchaahar se rail line kaa vaada to kiya lekin us yojana ke liye survey or 190 karod kaa aavanton piem narendra modi ke kaarykaal main puraa hua he

 In such a situation, the government is going to do them relief rather than bringing them 10 percent reservation

 This is probably the worst Congress performance in Maharashtra
 congress ko is baat kaa bhi afsos hona chahie ki jo party 125 saal pehle mumbai kii dharti par hi bani, aaj vahaan 1 seat ke liye taras rahi he
 The Congress would not get even a single seat in Maharashtra if former Shiv Sena MLA Suresh Narayan does not join the Congress and defeats bjp's strongman Hansraj Ahir from Chandrapur in a tough fight
 suresh narayan ke alaava congress ke sabhi bade chehre haar gaye, inamen do purv mukhyamantri sholapur se susheel kumaar scindia, nanded se ashok chavaan, maharashtra congress ke purv adhyaksh manikraav thakare yavatmal se or purv kendriya mantri milind devda mumbai dakshin se parajeet hue hai
 However, NCP was shocked by the defeat of Ajit Pawar's son but from 2014 he managed to win 1 seat more i
e
 5 seats
 shivasena ne bhi pichhali baar kii 18 siton kaa aankada chhu liya lekin modi lahar ke baavjood kendriya mantri anant geete, anand adsul, chandrakant khere or shivaji raav patil chunaav haar gaye
 Maharashtra's final results were the same as in 2014
 jahaan congress ko 1, ensipi ko 5, AIMIM ko 1 seat mili jabaki shivasena-bijepi 41 siten bachaane main kaamyaab rahi
 The concern for the UPA alliance is that their vote share has come down to 31 per cent and is 3 per cent lower than in 2014
 wo ek baar phir mumbai kii sabhi 6 siten haar gai jabaki unke paas sanjay nirupam, priya dutt or urmila matondkar jaise chehre the
 The most important thing is that a third player has also come in the politics of Maharashtra, which has given a strong blow to the UPA alliance in at least 8 seats

 congress ko ummid thi ki uski siten badhengi lekin VBA ne sangli buldhaana, yavatmal, haataknangle, parabhani or gatchiroli main party ne 70 hajaar se dedh lakh tak vot kaate jisase upie ummidavaar haar gaye
 Even Ashok Chavan and Sushil Kumar Shinde had to face defeat due to VBA
 VBA darasal muslim or daliton ke gathjod se bani party he jisane congress ensipi ke vot bank main send lagaai
 In Maharashtra's Marathwada and Western Maharashtra, the UPA had good expectations from the Shiv Sena, but caste equations spoiled the game
 congress ne prakaash ambedkar se kai baar baatcheet ki lekin wo siton par samjhauta karne main naakaam rahi
 Chavan himself remained confined in his constituency and after the election he admitted that the deprived Bahujan Aghadis have damaged the UPA in Maharashtra
 mana ja rahaa he ki vanchit bahujan aghadi aane vaale maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main bhi upie ke liye sirdard sabit hogi jo sirf 4 maheene dur hai
 Though NCP chief Sharad Pawar believes that the vote share of the deprived Bahujan Aghadi will decrease in the assembly elections, but the truth is that if the Congress NCP does not find a break soon, then the hope of winning in the assembly will be meaningless

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki pradhanmantri ne sansad main apana bachaav karne ke liye 'ek mahila' ko aage kiya he kyonki vah khud apana bachaav nahin kar sakate
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi reacted sharply to his remarks and accused the opposition of insulting Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne buudhvaar ko jaipur main yojit kisaanon kii raily main kaha tha ki 56 inch kaa seenaa rakhane vaala chaukeedaar bhaag gaya or ek mahila sitaraman ji se kaha ki meraa bachaav kiijie
 i cannot defend myself, defend me
 rahul gandhi ne 'mahila' shabd kaa istemaal karte hue kaha, 'dhai ghante tak mahila unka bachaav nahin kar pai
 i asked a direct question - answer yes or no but she could not answer
 ' unhone pradhanmantri par charchaa se ek baar phir bhaagane kaa aarope lagaaya lekin is baar raksha mantri kaa zikr nahin kiya
 At a public meeting in Agra, hours after Rahul's speech, Prime Minister Modi accused Congress leaders of insulting the women of the country
 unhone kaha ki raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne rafel saude par sansad ke patal par ek ke baad ek tathy ko rakhkar loksabhaa main vipaksh ke chakke chhudaa die
 On insulting the woman defense minister, Prime Minister Modi said without naming Rahul Gandhi, 'he has gone on insulting a woman defense minister
 yah desh kii mahilaon kaa apmaan he
 This is an insult not only to a woman but to all the women power of India for which these irresponsible leaders will have to pay the price
 ' pradhanmantri ne kaha ki yah garv kii baat he ki ek mahila desh main pehali baar raksha mantri baniin
 Rahul Gandhi was addressing the first public meeting after the Congress came to power in Rajasthan after the assembly elections held in 5 states last month
 unhone kaha ki agar is saal loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad congress centre main satta main aati he to vah krishi karj maaf karegi
 Reiterating allegations of alleged irregularities in the Rafale deal, he said that it should be investigated and a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) should be formed
 vipaksh ke netaa ne daawa kiya ki modi saude par unke dwaara puche kuch sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin de paae
 Amid the slogans of 'prime Minister's hate' being spread by the Prime Minister, Rahul said, 'rafael case is being discussed in Lok Sabha, Narendra Modi has fled to Punjab and gives a speech at a university there
 magar janata kii adaalat main (loksabhaa) main, modi ji ne ek minute ke liye kadam nahin rakhaa
 Because the watchman has stolen and the watchman runs away in fear
 ' unhone pradhanmantri par ghrinaa failaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 The Congress President said, "we will neither speak profusely about the Chief Minister nor the Prime Minister and where there is a need to respect him, the Congress Party will respect him
 agar rafel maamle main modi ne anil ambani ko 30,000 karod rupee chori karke dilwaaye to nyaay kaa kaam bhi hoga
 Victimization will not happen
 dabaav nahin banaaya jayega lekin nyaay jarur dilvaaya jayega
 The Congress leader said that if the Congress government comes to power at the Center, the farm loan will be waived but at the same time he said that debt waiver is not a permanent solution to the problem
 unhone kaha, 'jo karjamaafee kii baat thi, isse kisaan ko madad jarur milegi lekin uski samasya hal nahin hogi
 This is just the first step, it is not the last step because without any new strategy, the future of the farmers cannot be created in the country
 bihar sarkaar pradesh main koi nayaa jila or anumandal nahin banaaegi

 Responding to them, Yadav said that there is no proposal at present for the creation of new district and subdivision in the state
 kesari ke mutabik vah jaananaa chaahate the ki kya farbishganj anumandal ko jila banaae jane ko lekar teen saal pehle sthaneey nikaay or prashasan kii ore se koi prastaav bheja gaya tha yaa nahin?up mukhyamantri kii adhyakshata main nahin bani kamitifarbishganj seat se vidhayak kesari ne poocha ki pradesh kii pichhali endie sarkaar ne pradesh main nae jila or anumandal ke srijan kii sambhaavna talashne ke lieupmukhyamantriki adhyakshata main koi cameti kaa kaa gathan kiya tha
 To this, Minister Bijendra Yadav said in his reply that nothing like this was done

 bataaya ja rahaa he ki jin logon ko is bare main jaankaree thi inamen vitt mantri arun jetali, khud shaktikant das, arabiai ke governor urjit patel or piemo main pramukh sachiv nripendra mishra aadi shaamil hai
 The comments adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki 500-1000 rupee ke note khatm karne ke faisle main waisi hi gopneeyata rakhi gai jaisi ki bajet banaate vakt hoti he
 The aim behind this was that no one could take advantage of it
 sarkaar ko apane is maqasad main puri kamyaabi mili kyonki pradhanmantri ke elaan ke baad hi puure desh ko iske bare main pataa chalaa
 However work on it started about six months ago
 bainkon main 2000 rupee ke note chap kar pahunchane lage the
 But the bank employees were not told what to do with those notes and why they were delivered
 jaahir he is elaan kii kamyaabi isi baat main thi ki isse pardaa na hat sake or is maamle main puri tarah se aisa hi hua

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will give an interview to Doordarshan in the next morning to answer the questions raised in the minds of common people
 ye bhi tay hua ki adhikari vistaar se faisle kii jaankaree denge taaki koi bhram na rahe
 That is why the press conference of the officials started soon after the Prime Minister's message
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main aarthik maamalon ke sachiv shaktikant das ne kaha ki note khatm karne ke faisle kii jaankaree chuninda logon ko hi thi

 One house is running and the other is not, it is not the arrogance of numbers
 rajyasabha main sadan ke netaa ke rup main arun jetali ke is jawaab main seetaram yechuri kaa jawaab aata he ki yah sadan nahin chal rahaa he or vah sadan chal rahaa he, sirf is vajah se ki vahaan bahumat kaa aatank he
 Read these two arguments in Rajya Sabha again and again this morning
 sansadeey raajnneeti yaa ranneeti ke lihaaz se brahmastra-se lagane ke baad bhi ye donon hi vaakya khokhale lagate hai
 These are more ringing in empty vessels, they do not mean anything special
 donon hi vaakya sadan ko chalane dene kaa rasta nahin sujhaate hai, balki apane-apane ahankaar ko nitigat aavaran dete hai
 The fact is that even in the Lok Sabha, the Opposition has such a number that it will obstruct the proceedings of the House and the Government has so much sense in the Rajya Sabha that it can handle the whole matter with a statement of 30 seconds
 virodh ke naam par jo gatirodh paidaa ho rahaa he, vah batakuchchan se zyada nahin he
 The behavior of the Congress and the BJP in not allowing the house to run is so similar that you keep weighing the scales, yet you will not be able to keep them on separate pan
 congress, bijepi hi kyon, tamaam dalon kaa bartaav ek jaisaa he
 If you don't want to walk, don't give it
 15veen loksabhaa ke dauraan bijepi ne satr ke satr kaa bahishkaar kiya tha
 What she used to argue then, has now become either the Congress or the opposition and the government has started talking like the Congress government then
 desh kaa kaam tab bhi ruk rahaa tha, or desh kaa kaam ab bhi thap ho rahaa he
 In this case, the BJP is as morally weak as the Congress
 15veen loksabhaa kaa aitihaasik rup se kharaab ricard sirf congress kii naakaami nahin he, balki bijepi kii bhi he
 Both these big parties were then, and still are today
 sankhya bhale hi idhar se udhar ho gai he, lekin in donon ne sadan ko chalane dene main apane-apane vakt par koi anukaraniya udaarahan pesh nahin kiya
 That is why the Congress and opposition parties doing politics of uproar find the moral preaching of the BJP as hollow as the Congress' preaching that the government is responsible for running the house
 rajyasabha main congress ke saath anya vipakshi dal bhi ekajute hai
 Is the Prime Minister's response to the statements of conversion and attacks on religious freedom so irrelevant that he has been ignoring the demands of opposition members for so many days
 congress ke jamaane se sansadeey raajnneeti main aisi saamanti parampara ban gai he ki pradhanmantri hameshaa nahin bolenge
 What makes it sarkaar jab sadan ke prati jimmedaar hoti he or pradhanmantri sadan ke baahar bolte hi hai, nirantar samvaad kii mudra main rahete hi hai, to sadan ke bheetar rose ek bayaan dene main kya jaataa he
 Is the government not following the policy of arrogance? kya is masale par pradhanmantri kii chuppi dharmantaran yaa dharmik kunthaon ko zaahir karne vaale netaaon yaa sanghathanon kaa hausala nahin badhaati he
 When the Prime Minister is telling his mps that we have come only by winning on the agenda of development, then he could have said this in the House as well
 sharad yadav baar-baar kah rahe hai ki pradhanmantri ne pratishtha kaa sawaal bana liya he ki is masale par nahin bolenge
 Has the opposition not made the Prime Minister's statement a question of prestige? zaahir he, vipaksh kii daleelon main bhi kamazoriyaan hai
 As the matter comes under the Ministry of Home Affairs, the statement of Home Minister Rajnath Singh should be considered sufficient, but the opposition says that the atmosphere of religious bitterness is being created in the country on the pretext of conversion and clarity in this matter is the most of the government
 Big leaders will come only from the Prime Minister's statement
 pradhanmantri baahar jitna kah len, lekin sadan ke bheetar kaa bayaan hi zyada aupchaarik or nitigat mana jayega
 Should the opposition not abstain from seeking the Prime Minister's statement until it is discussed
 satyavrath chaturvedi kehete hai ki hamen bas aashwaasan chahie ki charchaa ke baad pradhanmantri bolenge to is par bhi sarkaar chup he
 If the government is not giving any assurance on the demand for discussion right now, then what is the confidence that after the debate, the Prime Minister will answer, and if he gives, then what is the harm in saying first
 bijepi vipaksh par aarope laga rahi he ki kai bill atake pade hai
 Satyavrat Chaturvedi is saying that we have helped pass five bills
 beemaa bill main sarkaar ke saath sahyog hi kiya he
 The BJP has also won the issue of the Prime Minister's silence in the Congress era
 jab inkaa netaa bolta he to sadan main bolne main kya pareshaani he
 Can he not disarm the opposition by making a statement? thik he ki pradhanmantri apane str par janata se nirantar samvaad karte rahete hai, lekin yahi prakriya sadan ke bheetar ho to kya hamen manmohan dashak se kuch alag or nayaa nahin dikhegaa ki maujuuda pradaanmantri sirf vipaksh kii maang par hi nahin, khud se bhi kai muddon par bolte hai, nai paripati bana rahe hai
 This ego fight between power and opposition cannot be decided on the scale of right and wrong, as both are wrong
 is maamle main nai lakeer khinchne kaa mauka agar kisi ke paas he, to vah sarkaar he or sarkaar ke mukhiya ko bayaan dekar yah lakeer khinch deni chahie
 It should also be said that as often as the opposition asks, if i stay in the House, only i will answer
 isamen ahankaar kii kya baat he
 The dignity of the Prime Minister will increase or decrease
 meri raay main to badhegi
 The BJP used to do the same while in opposition
 congress or bijepi khub match khelte the
 The BJP used to say discuss it, but do it under this rule
 upie sarkaar kahati thi ki charchaa karenge, lekin us niyam ke tahat nahin, is niyam main karenge
 As a result, the House did not run for weeks
 nuksaan kiskaa hua
 Congress, BJP or country
 zero ower ke chalane main rajyasabha or loksabhaa donon kaa ricard kharaab he
 This is also happening because we have integrated politics into parties
 ham kabhi sansadeey raajnneeti ko congress, bijepi ke khaanche se baahar nahin dekh pate hai
 During the election, our emphasis is so much on the government that we forget that the Election Commission conducts elections for the formation of Lok Sabha for the government
 ek acha saansad chunane ke liye karaata he, lekin raajnneetik dal chaalaaki se ise ek netaa yaa ek dal kii sarkaar ke abhiyaan main badal dete hai
 The time has come for us to understand the difference between parliamentary politics and electoral politics
 ham sansadeey daanv-penchon ko bhi nae sire se paribhaashit karen
 If there is a ruckus in the opposition, what is the government not listening to? phir samvaad kahaan he
 The electoral prospects are not being affected by this wager at the moment, but the public is being denied the opportunity to hear detailed debate on all the issues
 yah loktantr kaa bada nuksaan he ki ham bhi ek aasaan raay bana lete hai
 It is the opinion of right or wrong
 ham kisi vidheyak kii baarikiyon or apane jivan par padane vaale achche-bure prabhaavon ko lekar kabhi bahes nahin karte
 We all need it clearly or across
 shaayad isi kaa nateeja he rajyasabha main gatirodh

 videshi madiraa main lagbhag solah percent kii giravat he or bear main pantis pratishat kii vruddhi he
 Question - Why is the decline coming to know something? In the fall and fall, the cost of alcohol is also an important reason
 dukaanon par avaidh na bike iske liye saghan checking kii ja rahi he

 saghan jaanch kaa bhi aadesh hua he ki kahin se bhi avaidh madiraa kii bikri na hone paae

 zyaadaatar congressiyon ke liye rahul gandhi party kaa bhavishya hai lekin dilli kii purv siem shila dikshit kii maane to rahul gandhi ab bhi mechor nahin hai or unhen abhi or vakt kii zarurat he
 'still not a matriarch' In an interview given to the English newspaper 'the Times of India', Sheela said, 'the party is keeping pace with the rapidly changing attitude, language and relationships in politics
 aapako yaad rakhana hoga ki rahul gandhi ab bhi paripakv nahin hai
 His age does not allow this
 unhen or vakt milanaa chahie
 The Congress believes in the politics of the poor
 rahul kisaanon kii baat karne vaale iklaute rashtriya netaa hai
 According to Dixit, Rahul Gandhi has decided a long time in politics and he will have many chances to become PM
 is saal adhyaksh banenge rahul?purv mukhyamantri ne ummid jataai ki rahul gandhi ko is saal hi party kaa adhyaksh banaaya ja saktaa he
 According to him, 'this decision is awaiting Rahul Gandhi's approval
 mujhe lagata he party chunaav khatm hone ke baad ye kadam uthaaegi
 Priyanka was praised and praised Priyanka Gandhi in the interview
 unki najar main priyanka ek samvedansheel or budhimaan netaa hai or logon ko behad dhyaan se sunati hai
 He has silently formed an alliance with the Samajwadi Party in UP
 haalanki priyanka ke sakriy raajnneeti main aane par unhone kuch nahin kaha
 Sheela Dixit also refused to speculate that she is not campaigning in UP
 unki maane to wo party ke kaarykram ke mutabik apana yogadan de rahi hai or party unhen jo bhi jimmedaari degi, use wo puraa karengi
 So it should not be assumed that he has taken retirement from politics
 abhi paripakv nahin hue hai rahul gandhicendre sarkaar main petroleum mantri dharmendra pradhan ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ko abhi unki party ke log hi syrius nahin lete hai
 He is a big leader of the Congress party and is still not mature
 isliye main unke bare main kuch nahin kahana chahta hum
 He said that Sheila Dixit came to mind lately and accepted that Rahul is not yet mature
 iske liye main shila dikshit ko badhai detaa hu
 Anyway, the public is rejecting Rahul Gandhi everywhere
 unhone kaha ki mujhe mere pradhanmantri kii soch par garv mahasoos hota he ki gadhe se bhi desh ke liye kaam karne kii prerana lete hai
 The politics of UP determines the direction of the politics of the country, so i will say that after the victories of Maharashtra and Orissa, it has been proved that in UP, the government was won by winning more seats
 hindu dharm ke anusaar, vishnu ko parameshwar ke teen mukhya roopon main se ek mana jaataa he
 Vishnu is considered to be the follower of the world
 ve trimurti kaa ahm hissaa hai or unhen sarvyaapt mana jaataa he
 They are also called Narayana because of the shelter of all living creatures on the earth
 kehete hai ki samoochaa vishwa bhagwaan vishnu kii shakti se hi sanchalit he
 He is full of attributes as well as free of attributes
 ve apane chaaron haathon main shankh, chakra, gada or padam dhaaran karte hai
 His residence is Kshirsagar and he sleeps above Sheshnag
 jagat ke paalanhaar se seekhen safal or suramya jindagi bitaane ke kuch gur
 
 
 1
 hameshaa sanyam banaae rakhenvishnu ko ek aise bhagwaan ke rup main khyaati praapt he jo visham paristhitiyon main bhi dhairya nahin khote
 Maintain moderation
 iske saath-saath ve dusron kii madad ke liye hameshaa tatpar rahete hai
 2
 multitasking seekhenvishnu ko yadi najadik se dekhen or padhein to ham pate hai ki ve ek parfect multitaskar hai
 At the same time, he is performing his work in many forms - avatars
 itnaa hi nahin ve aise tamaam kaamon ko anjaam dete hue lesh maatr nahin thakte
 3
 paroapkaar karnaa koi unase seekhekaa jaataa he ki neki kar dariyaa main daal, lekin ham sabhi dusron se is baat kii apeksha karte hai ki hamane jo dusron ke upar upkaar kiye hai to aglaa hamareupakaronke boj tale dabaa rahe
 At the same time, Vishnu always inspires us to do righteousness and forget it in view of wider social interest
 4
 To be patient in every odd situation Vishnu has always got a reputation as a God who is present at the request of the gods and you
 kabhi dhairya nahin khote or har sambhav madad karte hai
 You will remember the arrival of Vasudev running to pull the leg of the elephant by a manger and his request
 5
 Full respect to life partner Vishnu and his Goddess Lakshmi are perfect example of today's society

 Narayan Sai, who is making a mockery of hypocrisy on the stage, is now such that he has changed his style
 jin bal or dadhi kii badaulat unke satsang kii dukaan chal rahi thi, narayan sai ke ek sadhak kii maane to ab sai ne apane unheen bal or daadhiyon se tauba kar liya he
 When Stars were high, they used to play Dandiya with the gopis, taking the form of Lord Krishna
 dandiya khel kar jab man bhar jaataa tha, to pravachan kii dukaan sajaa lete the
 And when he was bored by sharing knowledge, he stopped holding the flute and started mimicking Kanha again
 lekin ab ye janaab balaatkaar or yon shoshan ke ilzaamon se aise ghire hai ki alag-alag rup dharanevaala ye cheharaa chhipaae nahin chhip rahaa he
 The mask of hypocrisy and hypocrisy has descended from Narayan Sai's face such that now his face has become his biggest problem
 agra ke rahane vaale narayan sai ke ek sadhak lakshmana sevakani ne bataaya ki unhone bal or dadhi ke bagaiyr clin shevd avatar main unhen dekha he
 In fact, when the crime branch team raided Agra in search of Narayan Sai, playing a cat-and-mouse game with the Gujarat Police, this story came to light
 pataa chalaa ki police se bhaagane ke chakkar main narayan sai shanivaar kii raat ko agra main apane isi sevak ke ghar pahunchaa tha
 Sai, who accompanied his driver, demanded a new SIM card from him
 jise puraa karne se unke sevadaar ne inkaar to kar diya, lekin raat ko narayan sai ko panaah jarur di or doodh pilaayaa
 But during this time, the form of Narayan Sai he saw was different from all the forms of Narayan
 is baar naa to narayan ke sir main bal the or naa hi chehre par
 That is, Narayan had shaved the hairs of his head and also shaved his beard in order to escape from the police
 vaise narayan sai ke is nae rup ke bare main sevakani ke khulaase ke baad, ab police ne bhi narayan sai ko alag-alag roopon main vijualise karne kii koshish shuru kar di he, taaki chuuhe-billi ke is khel main achaanak narayan ke saamne aa jane par unhen pahchaanane main koi galati naa ho jaae
 And in addition to his normal hulli in these faces of Narayan Sai, the police are also making sketches of hair and mustache on the head, hair on the head and clean shaved and head and face without hair and beard
 surat main balaatkaar kii report darj hone ke baad narayan sai ke khilaaf in dinon gujarat police ne lukout notice jari kar rakhaa he, lekin narayan sai hai ki police kaa saamana karne kii bajaay lagaataar usase bhaagane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Talking using the new sim
 6 oktober ko surat kii do bahanon ne asaram or iske bete narayan sai par rape kaa aarope lagaaya
 The younger sister lodged an FIR in Surat
 bas usee din se narayan sai gaayab ho gaya, nahin to tab tak apane pita ke gunahon ko chupaane main laga tha
 On the night of 6 October, Narayan Sai was at his secret base in Hanuman Nagar, Jaipur
 us vakt uske saath uskaa kareebi sahyogi mohit bhojawaani bhi tha, jise baad main police ne giraftaar kar liya
 On October 7, Alsubah Narayan Sai boarded a black Fortuner car and drove from Jaipur to his ashram in Sriganganagar
 vahaan se wo dilli bhaag aayaa
 During this, the search for police continued
 17 oktober ko jaipur ke ashram main police ne chapa maaraa
 With Mohit Bhojwani, a friend of Baikeda Narayan Sai
 police ne jab narayan sai ke goner road vaale ashram main khojbin shuru kii to to ye chaunkaane vaali jaankaree mili ki kaise narayan ke liye is ashram main ladakiyon kii supplai hoti thi
 The police also found several indecent photographs and MMS from Bhojwani's laptop
 mohit bhojawaani par aarope he ki apane hwatrup ke jariye usne naa sirf samarthakon ko bhadakaane kii koshish kii, balki kai massej main code verde kaa bhi istemaal hua he
 In a conversation with a monk named Monika, Mohit wrote something like - Ram Ram, if you got the goods
 
 
 monica
 If not found, then Hari Hari darasal, narayan sai kii ashleel chaukadi main teen or mohare hai- mohit bhojawaani, jiskaa kaam logon ko bhadakaana or narayan ko idhar-udhar bhagaanaa tha
 The second name is of Monika Agarwal, who supplied girls for Sai and the third name is of Hanuman, who is also the cook of Narayan Sai and the one to pressure the girls for that
 kai saalon tak naa jane kitne gunahon ko anjaam dene vaale narayan sai ne agrim jamaanat ke liye edi chotii kaa jor laga diya or us chakkar main aarope he ki adaalat main usne farji halafanama bhi de diya
 However, the court rejected the anticipatory bail plea
 lekin narayan sai ek peshewar apradhi kii tarah khud ko bachaane ke liye har shaatir chaal chalata rahaa
 He changed 17 sims of mobiles only after he was accused of rape
 har sim kaa istemaal ek baar karke use tod detaa he
 The last time he asked for his Sim seeker from Agra but he refused to give it
 jo dinabhar main kanha ban logon ko dharm kaa paath padhaata tha, duniya kii nazaron se hatate hi sex gang kaa sargana ban jaataa
 Yes, the new image of Narayan Sai that the police are seeing in the mirror of Taftish is like this
 unke is gang kaa ek hi torget tha, nai-nai ladakiyon ko fansaa kar 'motaa-bhagwaan' kii kutiyaa tak le janaa or phir band kutiyaa main bhakton kii aabru taar-taar karnaa
 When Asaram advised his son Narayan Sai to run a sex gang on the stage, ta-ta Thayya karate-karate Karate, these millions of devotees watching the father-son feat did not know
 wo to gujarat police ne jab asaram ko baltaakaar ke ilzaam main giraftaar kar unase unke karatuuton ke bare main poochtacha kii, to naa sirf khud asaram ke balki unke bete narayan sai ke gang kii bhi pole-pattee khul kar jamaane ke saamne aa gai
 It was learned that Narayan Sai, like his father Asaram, wandered across the country with a gang of goons like his seeker
 or is gang kaa sirf or sirf ek hi kaam tha, nai-nai ladakiyon ko fans kar narayan sai ke saamne pesh karnaa
 If sources of the Gujarat Police are to be believed, Narayan Sai assigned different jobs to every henchman working in this gang
 koi ladki ko tathakthith samarpan ke liye taiyaar karata to koi samarpan ke baad ladki ko special mahasoos karaata
 And if a girl rebelled, someone else would do the job of dealing with her
 kul milakar, sai kaa sex gang kai myanon main apane baap asaram ke gang se bhi bad kar tha

 Baba Ramdev said that at present, the price of petrol and diesel is working to empty the common man's pocket
 vahiin jiesti main yadi 28 fisadi ke tex dar par petrol-dijal ko shaamil kiya gaya to aam aadmi ko raahat nahin milegi
 On the central government's stance on reducing the prices of petrol and diesel during the NDTV youth program, Baba Ramdev said that if the government's revenue is being lost due to the reduction of tax on petrol and diesel, it will compensate the rich people in the country
 It can do it by levying more tax
 GST ho lagu to turant 89 se 60 rupee litre aa jayega petrol, dijal hoga 50 kadesh main lagaataar badhati petrol auki dijal kii keemton ne modi sarkaar ke saamne kadi chunautiyaan rakh di he
 On the one hand, in the global currency market, the strength of the rupee is decreasing against the dollar continuously, due to the weak rupee, it has to spend more dollars to buy expensive crude oil
 iran par laga america pratibandh or bharat samet anya deshon dwaara is pratibandh ko maangane kii antim tithi jaise-jaise najadik aa rahi he, crude oil kii keemton main oochaal dekhne ko mil rahi he
 In such a situation, the central government is trying to save the loss of revenue from tax on petrol and diesel
 gauratlab he ki yadi modi sarkaar petrol-dijal par exise duty main mahaj 1 rupee kii katautee kare to kendriya rajasav ko 14,000 karod rupee kaa nuksaan hota he
 3 of GDP from this loss to the fiscal deficit for the central government
 3 fisadi ke lakshya par rakhana naammumkin ho jayega
 19 on Central Government Petrol
 48 rupee prati litre or dijal par 15
 33 per liter excise duty is being charged
