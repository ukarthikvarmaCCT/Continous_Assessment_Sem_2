 One of them is BJP MP Ashok Argal, who has so far managed to stay out of the box due to the fact that Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar has not been allowed to arrest him

 On August 15, India Today's cover story told how Amar Singh survived the questioning
 is cond kii jaanch kar rahi sansadeey samiti ne rajyasabha ke ek sadsy se poochtacha karne se inkaar kar diya tha, kyonki use lagata tha ki isaki prakriya zyada 'jhanjht vaali' he
 Due to this, Delhi Police also became lazy about Amar Singh
 ab sari nigahen amar singh par hai
 If he opens the tongue, problems may arise for the UPA, which Amar Singh helped overcome by the no-confidence motion of July 28, 2008
 dilli main sabase bada khulaa rahasy he yah ki ve congress ke varisht netaaon ke sampark main hai
 The no-confidence motion came at a time when Mulayam Singh Yadav was out of power and Amar Singh, who holds the number two position in the party, was bent on keeping the Samajwadi Party relevant in the political arena
 ve uttar pradesh kaa chunaav congress ke saath gathbandhan karke ladanaa chaahate the, par yah chaal antat naakaam rahi
 Three years later, the scandal and many of its unanswered questions now seem to be moving in the direction of longer lawsuits, as no one knows what Amar Singh would ask to remain silent
 philhal ek nijee think tanks objarwar research foundation ke mumbai chapter ke pramukh kulkarni ke bare main ummid he ki ve agle saptaah laut aaenge or police ke saamne pesh honge
 "he will be arrested soon," a Delhi Police official said
 '' is maamle kaa bhandaphod karne vaale kii bhoomika apnaane vaale kulkarni ko police ne upie-1 sarkaar ke khilaaf vot daalane se gaiyrhaazir rahane ke liye bhaajapa ke teen saansadon ko ghoose dene ke maamle main mukhya shadyantrkaari qaraar diya he
 The charge sheet of the Delhi Police states that the entire campaign to contact, instigate and trap the Congress and Samajwadi Party leaders was planned with another accused Suhail Hindustani at Kulkarni's house
 aarope patr main kaha gaya he ki ''hindustani or kulkarni kii koshish kaamyaab hui or amar singh vishwaas prastaav par gaiyrhaazir rahane ke liye bhaajapa ke harek saansad ko 3 karod ru
 Agreed to give ''abhi dilli main hi maujuud argal ulate congress par dilli police ko or is tarah aarope patr ko prabhavit karne kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 Argal, along with Kulaste and Bhagaura, were allegedly discovered to bribe to vote in favor of Congress during the 2008 vote split and they helped in conducting a sting operation to record the development
 ve kehete hai, ''ham adaalat ke faisle kaa sammaan karte hai, par yah faisla police ke daakhil aarope patr par aadhaarit he
 The charge sheet proves us corrupt
 agar ham bhrasht hote to noton ko sansad main dikhaane ke liye tivi camere na laae hote
 "they also say," This is done by Congress

 Former partners Sanjeev Saxena, Kulaste, Bhagaura and Hindustani will meet to give Amar Singh the accompaniment in Tihar, which was also needed

 unhone kuch phone kiye or apane samarthakon ko dilasa diya ki ve aaropee hai, abhi mujrim nahin
 The Congress has tried to stay away from the case and insisted that the arrests in this case are the culmination of an ongoing investigation under the supervision of the Supreme Court
 party pravaktaa abhishek manu singhvi ne kaha, ''ye giraftaaryaan supreme court kii behad najdiki dekharekh main chali padtaal ke puure hone par kii gai hai
 "meanwhile, there were speculations whether the arrest of Amar Singh would lead the investigation to the door of the government, as the UPA ultimately benefited from this development

 koi bhartiya pradhanmantri 17 saal main pehali nepal yatra karne vaala he
 Late Prime Minister IK Gujral visited Nepal in 1997

 He said that the government has taken the survey report of the OBC Commission, but after taking action on this report, reservation notification will be issued
 sarkaar yah bataae tabhi andolan ko khatm kiya jayega
 Accusing all ministers of lying, Jats are adamant on getting Muslim ministers Yunus Khan to announce Jat reservation
 inkaa kahana he ki ramajaan kaa maheenaa he or peedbludi mantri unuus khan ne roje rakh rakhe hai, isliye jhooth nahin bol sakate hai
 Therefore, Jat reservation should be announced from them

 The Jats of all districts, except the Jats of Dholpur and Bharatpur, have reservations in the movement of Vajhrajasthan

 The former Maharani of the Jat royal family of Dholpur is Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje herself
 magar dhaulpur main jaaton kii sankhya na ke baraabar he, isliye sara andolan bharatpur main ho rahaa he
 In 2002, the then Gehlot government gave reservation to the Jats of these districts in the state government, but in 2015 the Supreme Court banned it

 Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has said that the manner in which the new liquor prohibition law provides that if a bottle of liquor is found in one's house, then all the people of that household who are above the age of 18 years, all those Will be arrested and sent to jail
 usee tarj par agar bihar rajya main kahin sharaab milti he to phir mukhyamantri ko isaki jimmedaari lete hue giraftaar kiya janaa chahie or jail bheja janaa chahie
 Ram Vilas Paswan said this after stopping the decision of Patna High Court dismissing Puraneshrabbandikanoon
 unhone kaha ki jis tareeke se kadaa faisla liya gaya he ki ghar ke tamaam vyask ko jail janaa padegaa, usee tarj par siem ko bhi giraftaar kar jail bhejnaa chahie, agar rajya main kahin sharaab milti he to
 Talking to journalists in Patna, Paswan said that the LJP is not against alcoholism, but his party rejects and against the manner in which the law has been given

 beete 25 varshon main bhartiya cricket team ne desh or duniya bhar main anek match jite hai, lekin cricket kaa makka kahe jane vaale lords main test match jeetne kaa uskaa sapana ab tak adhuraa he
 The Indian team last won a Test match at Lord's under the captaincy of Kapil Dev in 1986, but has since won a Twenty20 and a 50-over World Cup to date, despite having finished first in the Test order
 The dream of his players celebrating victory in the Lord's balcony has not been realized
 kapil ke baad bharat ne sachin tendulkar, shrikant, mohammad ajaharuddin, saurav ganguli, rahul dravid, anil kumble or mahendra singh dhoni ke rup main anekon captain dekhe, lekin koi bhi lords main apni team ko jeet dilaane main safal nahin ho sakaa
 Under Dhoni's captaincy, the Indian team has set a record of success
 is lihaaj se dekhne vaali baat hogi ki dhoni apni team ke is 25 varsh lambey intjaar ko khatm kar pate hai yaa nahin
 The last time the Indian team tasted victory at Lord's, no player from the current team was able to make an international debut
 kai khilaadi aise hai, jinka us samay janm bhi nahin hua tha, jabaki kai aise hai, jinhone cricket kaa kakehara padhanaa shuru hi kiya tha
 India has played a total of 15 matches with the English team on this ground so far, out of which it has lost 10, while four matches have been drawn
 is lihaaj se 1986 kii jeet uske liye kaaphi ahm he
 The Indian team won that Test match between June 5 and 10, thanks to the brilliant century of Dilip Vengsarkar (126) and the excellent bowling of Kapil and Chetan Sharma
 vengsarakar or mohinder amarnath (69) kii shandaar ballebaaji kii badaulat bharat ne apni pehali pari main 341 ran banaae the
 Before that, he took the English team's first innings for 294 runs thanks to Chetan who took five wickets for 64 runs and Roger Binny, who took three wickets for 55 runs
 isamen graham gooch ke 114 or derek pringal ke 63 ran shaamil hai
 In the second innings, Kapil had four and Maninder Singh three wickets, the English team was piled on for 180 runs
 mike gaiting sarvaadhik 40 or alan lamb 39 ran bana sake the
 India had a target of 134 runs to win the match, which they achieved by losing five wickets
 england ke khilaaf hameshaa se acchhee ballebaaji karne vaale vengsarakar ne duusari pari main bhi sabase adhik 33 ran banaae the
 Ravi Shastri returned unbeaten on 20 and Azharuddin 14
 gavaskar ke balle se 22 ran nikle the
 Kapil was adjudged Man of the Match for his outstanding bowling and good captaincy

 In the election time of Gujarat, the main contest is BJP vs Congress, but even small parties are keen to play big game here
 bahujan samaaj party supremeo mayawati gujarat kii sabhi siton par chunaav ladane kii taiyaari kar rahi hai
 This bet of Maya can sway the Congress's hopes of defeating the BJP with the help of Dalit leader Jignesh in this election summer
 khaas baat ye he ki bijepi kii dhur virdohi mayawati kii gujarat main entry camel ke phool vaali is party ke liye phaayde kaa sauda bataai ja rahi he
 Political experts believe that since Mayawati will contest all the seats in Gujarat, it will be a danger bell for the Congress, which is claiming the Dalit votes due to Jignesh, because the entry of Maya will divide the Dalit votes
 khaas baat ye he ki bahujan samaaj party kaa gujarat main koi ullekhneey janaadhar nahin he
 The party has not won a single MLA from there so far
 lekin iske baavjood hathi jab-jab yahaan maidan main utraa he to kai siton par usne haar or jeet tay karne main badi bhoomika nibhaai he
 dalit-adivasis in Gujarat have 7 per cent Dalit voters in Gujarat, while there are 11 per cent Adivasis
 rajya kii kul 182 vidhansabha siton main se 10 dalit bahulya siten hai
 Apart from this, there are 26 assembly seats where the tribals win and lose
 gujarat main 40 vidhansabha siten aisi hai jo dalit or adivaasiyon ke liye arakshit hai
 Of these, 27 seats are reserved for Scheduled Tribes and 13 seats are reserved for Scheduled Castes
 gujarat main bispi kaa aadharabspi ko bhale hi abhi tak ke gujarat main hue vidhansabha chunaavon main ek bhi seat hasil nahin hui he, lekin chunaav ladane ke uske utsaah main koi kami nahin ai he
 This time too, the BSP has decided to contest the 182 seats of Gujarat with full force
 bispi ne 2002 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main apane 34 ummidavaar maidan main utaare the, jisamen se koi bhi jeet nahin sakaa tha
 0 to BSP in 2002
 32 fisadi vot mili the
 In the 2007 assembly elections, the BSP fielded 166 candidates and all had to face defeat
 haalanki party ko apana vot share badhaane main jarur kamyaabi mili, use 2
 It got 62 percent of the vote
 2012 main bispi 163 vidhansabha siton par ladi use 1
 Got 25 percent of the vote
 yani 2007 kii tulana main bispi ko nuksaan kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Dalit seats BJP had Congress dominance over tribal seats in the last assembly elections in 2012, while the BJP won the Scheduled Caste seats
 rajya kii anusuchit jati (essi) ke liye arakshit 13 siton par keval teen vadgam, kadi or danilimda vidhansabha seat par hi congress jeet darj kar saki thi
 Whereas BJP holds 10 seats including Vadodara, Eider, Gandhidham, Bardoli, Asarwa
 adivasee siten congress kii jholii menisi tarah 27 adivasee siton ko dekhen to inamen se ek par jadyu ke chotu vasava chune gaye the, baaki bachi 26 vidhansabha siton main se 16 par congress ne jeet darj kii thi or 10 siten bijepi ke khate main gai thim
 But this time due to the caste movement, the political equation of these seats has changed and everyone is watching them
 bispi se bijepi ko milegaa phayda: ashokadalit chintak ashok bhartiya ne kaha ki bispi ke gujarat chunaav main utarane se bijepi ko phayda or congress ko nuksaan uthaanaa padegaa
 The Congress has certainly embraced Jignesh Mevani but he will not be able to make much of an impact as Jignesh has his base among the urban Dalit voters of Gujarat
 iske alaava gujarat ke jameen se jude dalit netaa bispi ke saath khadey hai
 In such a situation, the Congress is not going to do much charisma even with the support of Jignesh
 jignesh ke congress ke samarthan se BSP kaa hoga nuksaayambedkarwaadi adivasee vichaarak sunil kumaar suman ne kaha ki gujarat main dalit chehre ke rup main jignesh mewaani kii ek pahchaan ban chuki he
 Even though he may not have come out of the Ambedkarite movement, Jignesh Mevani has made his mark through the Dalit movement in Gujarat
 gujarat main vah bahut bada cheharaa nahin hai, lekin jo bhi hai vahi hai
 It is true that their base is not in the whole of Gujarat, but there is a lot around Una
 mayawati ke swatantra chunaav ladane se congress ko nuksaan hoga, lekin jignesh ke chalate ye bahut zyada nahin hoga
 Only RSS working among tribals says that there is more tribal participation in Gujarat than Dalits, but there is no mention of them due to lack of political consciousness in them
 iske alaava adivasee samudaay kaa koi bada netaa bhi gujarat main nahin he
 In the current era, only RSS is working among the tribals, which will benefit BJP
 yuva tejasvi prasad yadav bihar ke nae up mukhyamantri honge
 He took oath immediately after Nitish Kumar at the swearing-in ceremony held at Gandhi Maidan in Patna on Friday
 tippaniyan Tejaswi is considered the political successor of former Bihar Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav
 unhone bihar main argedy ummidavaar ke taur par chunaav ladaa tha or prabhavi antar se jeet hasil karte hue vidhansabha pahunche the
 RJD has also won overwhelmingly 80 seats in Bihar assembly elections
 yah unke raajnneetik sahyogi jediu kii siton se nau adhik hai
 Nitish's JDU has got 71 seats in these elections
 tejasvi ko bihar ke purv mukhyamantri lalu prasad yadav kaa raajnneetik uttaradhikari mana ja rahaa he
 He contested as an RJD candidate in Bihar and won the Assembly by an effective margin
 bihar vidhansabha chunaav main argedy ne bhi jabardast safalataa hasil karte hue 80 siten jiti hai
 This is nine more than the seats of his political ally JDU
 nitish kii jediu ko in chunaavon main 71 siten mili hai
 If the betting is on pigeon or cricket, then betting only
 iske buniyadi taur-tareeke nahin badalte
 Speculators are so keen that they even recognize the movement of a flying pigeon
 or ek apni sarkaar he ki itani kamjor ki haath aae kabutar ko bhi uda detii he
 Actually the history of betting is centuries old
 alag-alag jamaane main sattebaaji kii alag-alag shakl hua karti thi
 And by incorporating the same powers, we have brought this special offer for you
 
 
 kabutar se cricket tak
 
 
 The most beautiful aspect of the slavery of Nur Jahan and Jehangir, which holds a special place in the stories of the Mughal Sultanate, is their first meeting
 or ittefaq se unki is pehali mulaakaat kaa gavaah ek kabutar hi bana tha
 The pigeon whose flight is very likeable
 lekin badalte vakt ne kabutar par daanv khilne vaale paidaa kar die
 The bet is on which pigeon flies so high or at what speed
 daav lagane vaale or kabutar ke bich agar talmail sahi baith gaya to daav lagane vaale kii pau-baarah
 As the British came, speculation became so common that the 1866 Gambling Act had to be enacted to stop it
 us vakt bomb or dilli se bada satta bazaar kalakatta kaa tha
 Then till today, by coming in, this game did not even spared the game
 par safed kapadon main tab cricket sachmuch jentalman game tha
 Since the British were in India, we soon learned the tricks of the game by throwing them
 47 main angrej to chale gaye par ham unka khel sikh chuke the
 Initially we waited a long time for victory
 lekin aaj ham jahaan hai uske peeche wo takat kaam kar rahi he jiske bal par ham maidan main lagaataar date rahe
 Then in the eighties, he got up from the cricket field and came on TV
 udhar hockey kii haalat lagaataar patali hota ja rahi thi
 So, watching hockey and dying in the house, the TV put Kiket on his head
 vakt badla to yaadon kii tarah blike and white tasviren bhi rangeen honi shuru ho gayi
 After the black and white TV phase of color TV started, the green grass of the field really started looking green
 par kapade ab bhi safed dikh rahe the
 And in the same white clothes, people were enjoying the test for six days while taking a day's rest
 par tivi rangeen ho chukaa tha
 The TV market was desperate to take part
 so kapade kab tak safed rahete? lihaaja safed ko rangeen banane ke liye fatfot cricket ko paidaa kiya gaya
 This one-day-old child born after a six-day test will produce such a rich pot from childhood, he himself did not even know who produced it
 isisi ke duusare bachche yani van-de ke paidaa hone se pehle tak mumbai kaa bisisiai parivaar garib jarur tha par parivaar main tab bhi khushhaali thi
 But as soon as this child came, his fate turned so that he saw that the richest family in the world, that is, the rich board
 paisa aayaa to takat bhi ai
 Now the BCCI was ruling the cricket ground
 par isi van-de ke saath cricket main ek apshakun aayaa
 Of match fixing
 rangeen tivi par cricket ghar-ghar ko lubhaa rahaa tha
 Matches were being seen from house to house
 or thik usee vakt anderworld don daaud ibrahim apane hi ghar se beghar hokar yani hindustan se bhaag kar dubai pahunch chukaa tha
 Cricket had also turned to desert by then
 sharajah main hindustan or pakistan ke match shuru hue
 The match proved to be a hit
 daaud mumbaise bhaagane ke baad sharajah main hi dikhaai detaa
 Cricketh was his hobby
 shauk kii khatir wo har match dekhtaa hua
 But when this hobby became his business, no one knew
 or jab tak pataa chalata tab tak daaud is khel ko ek nayaa khel bana chukaa tha
 Sports betting
 khel match phixing kaa
 Spot fixing
 ab khilaadi maidan main to khelte
 But how would d-company play? match phixing or satte ke liye van-de idial cricket tha
 Instant results and instant earnings in a single day
 dhandha joro par chal niklaa
 Dice to Pigeon, Pigeon to Matka and Matka to Mobile
 sattebaajon ne apane dhandhe ko chalaane ke liye har daur main nai takanic kaa sahaara liya
 But till then this business was in the hands of common people
 par jaise hi van-de cricket kaa janm hua or tivi blike and white se color, achaanak is dhandhe ko anderworld ne apni bapauti bana liya
 Then the game that started, is just not taking the name of pause
 international cricket council yani isisi ke duusare bachche van-de par jab di-company kaa saaya padaa to cricket maidan se uth kar satellite phone, pager or computer se hote hue mobile tak ja pahunchaa
 The possibility of fixing the entire match between the two teams changed the entire picture of betting
 khel aisa tha ki is khel ko khilne or khilaane ke liye naa dukaan kii jarurat thi, naa daftar kii
 Nor to invest capital
 bas, phone or kaagaj kii parchi ke saath jahaan baith gaye dukaan vahiin khul gai
 Just for this, he should definitely get the blessings of the d-company opening the bet
 yani hing lage naa fitkiri or munafa karodon kaa
 No risk from above
 kyonki pakade bhi gaye to sazaa kuch maheenon kii yaa jurmaana kuch sau rupye kaa
 What else could have been a better deal for the underworld
 lihaaja dekhte hi dekhte di-company kii kamai kaa sabase bada zariyaa yahi satta ban gaya
 The game was on
 maidan ke andar bhi or maidan ke baahar bhi
 However, in the same period, the genie of fixing came out of the bottle
 kai khilaadiyon par gaaj bhi giri
 There was a commotion
 rusavaai ke saath saaf-safai hui
 But the business still continued
 par phir isi bich isisi ke tisare bachche kaa janm hua
 Named T20
 ye baccha duusare bachche se bhi zyada honhaar niklaa
 As soon as he was born, he first came into the lap of Team India
 iske god main aate hi bisisiai ke lalit modi ne ipel kii shakl main iske judawaan bhai ko janm dene kaa faisla kiy
 The decision worked
 faqat kuch sau, phir hazaar, lakh se hote hue ab cricket karodon kaa khel ho chukaa tha
 The BCCI went from rich to richer and the players went from millionaires to millionaires and millionaires to billionaires
 22 gaj kii pich par daudane-bhaagane vaale khilaadi achaanak hathode ke neeche aa gaye
 Players started bidding
 tamaasha live ho rahaa tha
 The player is now valued not by his game but by the price of his buying and selling
 chah din ke test match se jo safai shuru hua tha wo ek din ke sau overon se hote hue teen ghante ke tamaashe tak ja puhancha tha
 More than one-day T20 betting became the earning pot for the market
 faqat teen ghante or 40 overon ke 240 gendon ne har gend ko bikaoo bana diya
 The spectacle was such that those who were not being sold for money, were sold by night party colors
 par duniya bhar kii cricket board bhi ab chaukanni thi
 So instead of risking fixing the entire match, the underworld devised a new game
 khel spoot phixing kaa
 Spot fixing means that there is no direct impact on the outcome of the match, but the session or over is sold out
 yani agar ek mauch ke do-chaar over kaa nateeja hi pehle se pataa chal jaae to kai sau karod kii kamai pakki
 The dressing room in Karachi, the changing room in Dubai and the ground on which the match is to be played
 ishaara karachi se hota, tijori dubai main khulti or us tijori main paise hindustan se bhare jate
 This is the only game of betting and this is the game of d-company
 or yahi he aaj ke daur kaa wo satta jo khud fiks he
 The game is on any pitch of the world, but the real player of this game sits in the dressing room of Karachi
 or vahiin se baithe-baithe wo aise-aise khel-khel kar jaataa he ki third ampire ri-play dekh kar bhi kuch nahin dekh pate
 Yes yes satte ke khel kaa asli badshaah di-company kaa bos yani daaud ibrahim hi he
 Everything from match fixing to spot fixing is a product of his dirty mind
 magar satte kii company kaa siio usne apane chote bhai anis ibrahim ko bana rakhaa he
 That is, Anees only sees the whole business
 isisi ke calendar ke hisaab se anis apana game set karata he
 Sitting in Karachi
 par uski sabase zyada najar hoti he un maichon par jinamein hindustan yaa pakistin kii timen khel rahi hoti hai
 Because all these earnings are from these two teams
 di company kaa satte kaa headquarter dubai ke burj deraa main he
 Its incharge in Dubai is Sunil Dubai

 One of them is named Manoj Metro while the other is Pawan Jaipur

 After receiving a signal from Karachi, Sunil makes contact with his agent in Dubai Manoj Metro and Pawan Hindustan and Pakistan

 Karachi is the hideout from where the entire game of spot fixing was being played in the IPL
 jahaan se satta kii line dubai ke raste hindustan tak pahunchati thi
 This is the stronghold from where spots are being fixed compared to IPL
 ye wo adde hai jahaan se hindustan kii cricket par sabase bada hamalaa ho rahaa he
 This is Dawood Ibrahim's address in Karachi from where his younger brother Anees Ibrahim bids the IPL players
 doosraa pataa he dubai kaa
 This house is of Anees Ibrahim's most trusted agent in Dubai, Sunil Hiranand Abhichandani
 cricket kaa ye shaatir buki he jo hawala ke jariye di company ke liye dubai main baith kar baaziyon kaa hisaab kitaab karata he
 Two dozen serious lawsuits are going on in India against Ali Budesh
 ye wo shaks he jisane dubai main daud ibrahim ke pair jamawaye or ab satte ke khel main daud ke pair ukhdvane par amada he
 Ramesh Vyas is the biggest henchman of d Company running a speculative exchange in Mumbai

 Anees Ibrahim's pieces are named after six bookies - Vicky, Jumbo, Kumar, Master Salman, Doctor Javed and Sharif in Bookies were earning black money for spot fixing
 sutron ke mutabik anis ibrahim ke kehane par hi vyas ne karachi kii line hindustan ke teen bookies ke liye khaastaur par jodi thi
 The names of Jupiter are prominent in these bookies apart from Tinku and Bharat from Delhi
 sattebaajon kii isi tigadi ne srisanth par dore daale or aish or cash ke jariye spot phixing ko anjaam diya
 Surendra Bangadi, known as Junior Kolkata, is also called Mr
 India in the world of speculation because it remains on the radar of the police but out of the grip
 sutron kii maane to surendra bangadi ke taar sidhe taur par dubai main baithe sunil dubai se jude hai
 According to police sources, on 14 May, when the Red Police of Mumbai Police was found in Kalba Devi and as soon as Ramesh Vyas was arrested, Surendra Bangadi was reported
 sutron kaa kahana he ki satte kii duniya main aaj kii taarikh main bangadi se bada khilaadi koi nahin or wo ipel ke kai khilaadiyon ke sidhe sampark main rahata he
 The truth is that it is only after Bangadi is arrested that the real face of the Indian Underworld League will be revealed

 Bollywood actress and Priyanka Chopra's cousin Parineeti says that Priyanka starrer 'fashion' is her favorite film and if it is remade, she would love to work in it

 This is my favorite film starring Didi
 meraa koi vishesh kirdaar nibhaane kaa sapana nahin he, main sirf acchhee filmein karnaa chaahati hum
 Parineeti (23), who made her Bollywood debut with Ladies vs Ricky Bahl, said that she does not want to compete with Priyanka
 priyanka ne fishan ke liye rashtriya puraskaar jeeta tha
 He said, 'it would be stupid to compete with Priyanka
 vah mujhase 10 varsh aage hai
 i am not crazy and i am not interested in getting ahead of them
 vah bahut shandaar abhinetri hai
 i can only learn from them
 'pariniti ne bataaya ki 'ishakajade' kii kamyaabi ke baad unhen yash raaj films (viaref) ke alaava kai duusari jagahon se bhi prastaav mil rahe hai
 'I am going to sign some films very soon because i am very curious about what will happen next

 bhartiya cinema main sangeet kaek puraa daur rahul dev burman ke naam he
 This is called the golden round
 sangeet ke diwane is anuthe fankaar ne kabhi pankhe kii aawaaj se hi dhun taiyaar kar lee to kabhi trephic jam unke liye dhun rachane kii prerana ban gaya
 Film journalist Taroji Deodhar, who has conducted several interviews with Rahul Dev Burman, said that the music in him was so composed that he did not need any special atmosphere to compose the tune
 kisi aawaaj main unhen sangeet kaa ahsaas hua or unhone us par hi ek dhun bana lee
 He also composed melodies on the sound emanating from the moving fan
 iskaa upyog unhone film ‘aapaki kasam’ ke geet ‘suno kaho, kaha suna’ geet main kiya tha
 'devdhar told' Rahul Dev Burman once stayed in a hotel after separating from his first wife
 unke saath unke guitar vadak bhanu gupta bhi the
 He was sitting there playing guitar like that suddenly a tune came to the mind of Pancham
 unhone vah dhun bhanu ko bataai
 The tune was from the second line of the song 'musafir Hoon Yaro' from the film 'parichay'
 iske baad donon raat bhar kaam karte rahe or subah tak puraa gaanaa taiyaar ho chukaa tha
 Veera Chaturvedi, who wrote 'pancham ke saat sur' on Burman, said, 'very few people would have noticed that the title music of' Pather Panchali 'and the song' Musafir Hoon Yaro 'are very similar
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki pancham ali akbar khan sahab ke shishy rahe hai isliye un par khan sahab ke sangeet kaa gaharaa prabhaav tha
 According to Deodhar, there was a deep friendship between Pancham and filmmaker Ramesh Bahl
 ek baar donon raat ko khaanaa khaane ke baad icecream khaane chale gaye or jam main funs gaye
 Ramesh was driving and Burman was sitting
 jam main gaadi kabhi ruukti or kabhi behad dhire dhire aage badhati thi
 The Burmans were watching everything and some were humming and there they prepared a tune
 yah dhun baad main ‘ghar’ film ke geet ‘tere bina jiya jaae naa’ main upyog kii gai
 Interestingly, he used the tune of the song 'funtush' in the song 'dukhi Mana Mere' very cleverly
 ‘funtoosh’ ke liye sangeet pancham ke pita es di burman kaa tha
 The tune of the song 'aye Meri Topi Palat Ke Aa' was composed by Pancham, but no one could find it nor did Pancham ever want to take credit for it
 lekin is geet kii lokapriyata ke liye pancham or unke pita ne ek duusare ko badhai di thi
 Veera said that while SD Burman's inclination was towards pure Indian classical music, Pancham definitely influenced the West in his music
 film ‘aradhana’ ke liye kai baar kaha gaya ki iskaa sangeet rahul dev burman ne taiyaar kiya tha
 But the film was actually composed by his father SD Burman
 un dinon pancham apane pita ke sahaayak the
 Born on 23 June 1939, Rahul Dev Burman breathed his last on 4 January 1994

 In Uttar Pradesh's Yogi Adityanath government, Cabinet Minister Omprakash Rajbhar himself is not talking about breaking away from the alliance, but it seems that he wants the BJP to separate him from the alliance
 isiilie aaj varanasi main unhone kaha ki main aisi harakat karata hum ki bijepi mujhe nikaal de

 During campaigning at the time of general election, he had declared Aadhaar as baseless and UPA government's political gimmick, but after coming to power, Modi's thinking changed and he was so fond of Aadhaar that he was making it mandatory for every scheme
 
 narendra modi ne 2014 main 8 april ko bengalooru main hui chunavi sabha ke dauraan kaha tha, 'maine aadhaar par rashtriya suraksha ke sawaal uthaae, koi jawaab nahin mila
 This is a political gimmick
 ' iske kuch hi din baad pradhanmantri pad kii shapath lete hi unhone aadhaar ko apana liya or sabhi ke liye anivaary ghoshit kar diya

 There was a constant suspicion among the common people about its imperative and there was also a panic among the people
 aadhaar card banavaane ko lekar ho rahi dikkaton ke bich 121 karod se zyada aadhaar jenerate kiye ja chuke hai
 Amid the upsurge over Aadhaar, the Supreme Court in its interim order in 2015 said that it would be voluntary and not mandatory
 saath hi yah bhi kaha ki aadhaar yojana ko chunauti dene vaali yachikaaon kaa nipataara hone tak kisi ko bhi aadhaar na hone ke kaaran yojana ke laabh se vanchit nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Although the government made the base legal after this order, the time-limit was repeatedly extended
 duusari ore, aam logon ko bagaiyr aadhaar ke jaruri madad nahin die jane kii khabaren bhi ain
 With increasing deadlines, the central government has fixed June 30 by extending the deadline for linking Aadhaar to welfare schemes (schemes like PDS, MNREGA and pension) for three months beyond the hearing in the Supreme Court
 isse pehle yah samay seemaa 31 march, 2018 thi
 a 5-judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra concluded the debate on the 10th of this month after a long hearing on a series of petitions challenging the imperative and legality of Aadhaar

 On the other hand, some people even lost their lives due to the imperative of Aadhaar card for the benefit of government schemes

 Many such people in backward areas of the country had to face a lot of difficulties due to lack of base
 march main aadhaar card nahin hone ke kaaran jharkhand main kareeb 12 lakh rashan card radd kar die gaye
 Later, the Center sought a report from the state government on how many ration cards were canceled due to lack of Aadhaar

 It has been 4 years since Narendra Modi came to power and as much discussion about the Aadhar card was not done during the tenure of the parent Congress during the Modi government

 The Supreme Court now has to decide on the imperative of Aadhaar

 dilli hai court ne ek abhootpurv faisle main nichali adaalat ke faisle ko palatate hue pati ko diya hua talaak radd kar diya
 The High Court ruled that either of the spouses cannot decide to leave only on the basis of who left the in-laws first because the conduct of one of the married couples could force the other to remain separate
 is

 'adequate reasons for the wife to be separated' The High Court gave this order in a case in which she had canceled the divorce granted to the husband on the grounds of abandonment by the wife in a family court
 peeth ne kaha ‘record se pataa chalata he ki prativaadee (pati) ne apilkarta (patni) ko choda tha jo ki aaj tak apane guzaara bhatte ke liye lard rahi he
 The bench further said that it was on record that the wife had sufficient grounds to live separately
 ’peeth ne kaha ‘hamaari raay he ki dwarka sthit parivaar adaalat ke jaj ne pramaan ko sahi tareeke se nahin samajha
 Although the appellant (wife) had left her in-laws but she never wanted her marital relationship to end forever
 ’pati ne mana patni par bete ko maarane kaa aarope krurtapith ke mutabik, ‘patni ne gavaahi main saaf kaha ki usne pehle 25 janvari 2002 ko or phir chah sitambar 2003 ko pati ke aacharan kii vajah se sasuraal choda or donon hi baar vah garbhvatee thi
 According to the High Court, the husband had admitted during the cross-examination that he had accused his wife of killing his son while the conduct was cruel
 donon ke bete kii janm ke kuch hi ghante baad maut ho gai thi
 In the judgment, the bench said that on September 6, 2003, the husband should stay out of the house till the wife's parents took the wife with her and applied for divorce on false grounds after two days
 isse saaf jaahir hota he ki vah (pati) apni patni ko kitna sammaan detaa tha or uske saath kaisaa vyavhaar karata tha

 Although the history of the luxurious Chief Minister's residence is not very old, but it is a strange coincidence that whoever came as a "king" to live in it, had to leave as a runk

 When the state was formed, it was made the Chief Minister's residence in the interim government
 lekin tatkaaleen mukhyamantri nityanand swami ne ise apane karyaalay ke taur par istemaal kiya
 Chief Minister ND Tiwari used to live in the circuit house next to it
 tiwari ne vahaan paanch saal puure kiye
 But during his five years, his chair kept on shaking so many times
 endi tiwari ke baad major general bisi khandudi mukhyamantri bane
 During his tenure, the work of the new Chief Minister's residence started
 awaas banakar taiyaar to ho gaya, lekin usamen pravesh karne se pehle hi khandudi satta se vidaa ho gaye
 Chance of entering new residence got CM Dr
 ramesh pokharial nishank ko
 But coincidentally, after a few days, he too lost his chair
 khandudi ne vaapasi kii or vah bhi nae awaas main teen maheene hi samay guzaar sake
 Obviously, no leader wants to place this 'defect' in his politics

 priyanka gandhi ke sakriy raajnneeti main kadam rakhane ke baad congress netaa utsaah se labarej hai or unki tulana unki daadi or purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi se kar rahe hai
 Amidst all this, former Punjab Chief Minister and Akali Dal leader Prakash Singh Badal has given a lot of advice to Priyanka Gandhi
 unhone kaha ki indira ne jo kaam kiye hai unhen priyanka gandhi bilkul na karen
 Prakash Singh Badal said, 'priyanka Gandhi looks like Indira Gandhi and has heard that she also copies them
 lekin main unase guzarish karuunga ki wo indira gandhi ko bilkul bhi copy naa karen, kyonki jis tarah ke kaam indira gandhi ne kiye the wo phir se nahin hone chahie
 He said that Indira Gandhi had attacked Shri Harminder Sahib (golden Temple of Amritsar)
 priyanka gandhi us tarah se indira gandhi ko bilkul bhi copy naa karen
 At the same time, he said that Priyanka Gandhi's entry into active Congress politics is not going to make much difference
 1984 main hua tha oparation blue starbata den ki purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne punjab main chal rahe aatankwaad ke safaaye ke liye oparation blue star chalaaya tha
 Fearing this campaign, in April 1984, Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale reached Akal Takht from Guru Nanak Niwas adjoining the Golden Temple
 akaal takht golden temple ke bilkul saamne he, yahi uskaa thikaana ban gaya tha
 Bhindranwale started operating the Khalistan movement from here
 aise main indira sarkaar ne punjab ke amritsar ko sena kii chhavnee main tabdeel kar diya
 On the night of May 1984, the army convoy reached Amritsar and other cities of Punjab
 bhindrawaale baari maatra main aslaa barood liye sikhon ke sabase pavitra sthal par kabiz tha
 CRPF and BSF personnel were keeping an eye on the buildings adjoining this site
 1 june kii raat 9 baje amritsar main karfu laga diya gaya or agle 24 ghanton ke bich kareeb 70 hajaar phogiyon ne puure punjab main apane pair pasaar liye the
 The army completely surrounded the Golden Temple
 3 june 1984 ko guruparv tha us din
 The devotees gathered at the Golden Temple to offer prayers and recite and the army was ready to end the terror of Bhindranwale
 3 june kii raat ko goldel temple main goliyon kii gunj sunai dene lage
 During this time, the army killed Bhindranwale there itself
 darasal sikh samudaay main bich shri harminder sahib kii kaaphi ahmiyat he
 It is considered the largest religious site of the Sikh community
 aise main vahaan par goli chalaane kii ijaajat ko lekar sikh samudaay indira gandhi se naaraaz ho gaye the
 Due to this, he was later shot dead by his Sikh security personnel
 karnataka main raajnneetik sankat (karnataka Political Crisis) ke bichhiraasat main liye gaye congress ke varisht netaa dike sivakumar (DK Shivkumar) ko mumbai police ne reeha kar diya he
 After being released from police custody, DK Shivkumar (DK Shivkumar) attacked the BJP and the Mumbai Police fiercely
 unhone kaha ki mumbai police ko shame aani chahie unhone mujhe mere naagarik adhikaar ke istemaal se roka he
 i had a booking at the hotel but i was told by the hotel staff that pressure was being made on them too
 main bas itnaa kahana chahta hum ki loktantr main satta aati or jaati he
 But no one should misuse the law
 main kanoon par bharosa karne vaala naagarik hum
 Came here to meet his friends and people associated with the party
 lekin wo mujhe unase milane nahin de rahe hai
 While the party mlas want to meet me
 main aapke saaf kar dena chahta hum ki mumbai police jo daleel de rahi he vah sachai se koson dur he
 He said that BJP is giving protection to the rebels
 sivakumar ne eenai se kaha tha ki mumbai police or baaki balon ko tainaat hone den, unhen unki duty karne den
 We have come to meet our friends
 raajnneeti main hamaara janm saath main hua tha or raajnneeti main ham saath main hi marenge
 They are members of our party
 ham unase milane aaen hai
 'DK Shivakumar said that i have booked a room here
 mere dost yahaan ruke hue hai
 There has been a small problem, we will talk
 dhamkee dene kaa koi sawaal nahin he, ham ek duusare se pyaar karte hai or sammaan karte hai
 'when stopped outside the hotel, DK Shivakumar told the police officers that i have no weapons
 mujhe andar kyon nahi jane diya ja rahaa
 Let me tell you that rebel mlas from Karnataka stayed in a hotel in Mumbai, demanding protection from the police
 mumbai police ko likhe ek patr main 10 vidhayakon ne kaha tha ki vah karnataka se mumbai aa rahe rajya ke netaaon se nahin milanaa chaahate hai
 The letter was signed by 10 mlas
 patr main kaha gaya tha, 'hamane suna he ki shri kumaraswami or shri sivakumar ke aane se hotel main hangaamaa ho saktaa he or hamen unase khatra mahasoos ho rahaa he
 We do not want to meet them
 kripaya is maamle main hamaari madad karen or un logon ko hotel main ghusane kii ijaajat naa den
 '(input: also from ANI) rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne ashanka jataai he ki yadi narendra modi ne phir se desh kii satta sanbhali to ho saktaa he desh main chunaav hona band jaaen
 He also feared dictatorship rule in India, citing China and Russia
 congress ke varisht netaa or siem ashok gahalot ne mangalvaar ko narendra modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal main ‘loktantr evam samvidhan' ko khatra hone kaa aarope lagaaya
 He claimed that if the people re-delegate power to Modi, it may be that we do not have elections (in India) or there may be a situation like China and Russia
 unhone yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki chunaav jeetne ke liye pradhanmantri kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai or vah virodhiyon ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 Gehlot lashed out at PM Modi, claiming that Modi was the 'master of marketing' and that 'if he had been in Bollywood, he would have left a different mark in the country and the world by his hanging and shackles
 ' gahalot ne ek saakshaatkaar main kaha ki ‘sachai hamaare paksh main he or hamen vishwaas he ki sachai kii hi jeet hogi
 Asked whether the truth would be defeated if the Congress lost, he said that if the public gives them the victory
 
 
 , agar modi ji dobaaraa jeet jate hai to is baat kii guarantee nahin he ki desh main chunaav honge yaa nahin
 He said that there will be elections or not
 
 
 jaise china, rus main hota he
 'significantly, China has a single party system, while Russia has Vladimir Putin for a long time
 gahalot ne daawa kiya ki modi ji kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai
 He can go to any extent before and after winning the election
 unke dimag main kya he, mujhe lagata he ki amit shah ko bhi nahin pataa he
 The Chief Minister of Rajasthan alleged that democracy is in danger, the Constitution is in danger and the country is in danger
 desh main keval do log
 
 
 Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are running the government
 kuch maheene pehle tak congress ke sanghathan mahasachiv rahe gahalot ne kaha ki modi ji ko rajeev gandhi ke baad spasht bahumat mila tha
 They had to think that responsibility had increased and they should have behaved responsibly
 lekin unhone mauka ganvaa diya
 The senior Congress leader said that people started saying four years ago that this man can do anything for the election
 yuddh bhi kara saktaa he
 It is not right to become this assumption about a Prime Minister
 pradhanmantri vah hota he jo logon ke dil ko chune vaali baat kare
 Gehlot said that Modi ji should do politics of issues
 par vah rashtrawaad ke naam par raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 Gehlot questioned whether we are not nationalists? He claimed that P
 Chidambaram and other leaders have been targeted
 kya bhaajapa main sabhi log doodh ke dhule hai? gahalot ne kaha ki amit shah kehete hai ki ham 50 saal tak raaj karenge isiilie ham kehete hai ki ye fonsiwadi log hai
 Opponents are targeted, do not let the law do its job
 haal hi shuru hue, pradhanmantri ke ‘main bhi chaukeedaar' abhiyaan par tanj kasate hue gahalot ne kaha ki kahin bhi jaao, log kehete hai ki chaukeedaar chor he
 Now he started the 'main Bhi Chowkidar' campaign
 saare mantriyon ne twitor handle ke naam badal liye
 They have come to the backfoot
 agar aap vastav main chaukeedaari karte hai to kya kalaadhan videshon se waapas aayaa? naukariyon kaa kya hua?congress netaa ne bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate hue yah bhi kaha ki inke diene main nafrat or gussa he
 You must have tolerance in democracy
 inke andar sahishnutaa nahin he
 He also alleged that Modi is the first Prime Minister of the country to hold public meetings on foreign soil and for this he has misused the Indian embassies
 gahalot ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki bijepi evam aresas desh main samvidhan se itar jaakar kaam kar rahe hai or sansthaaon par apni vichaardhaara thope rahe hai

 ' There is not much time in the assembly elections in Rajasthan, but the ruling BJP in the state has not been able to start its electoral exercise to preserve power because there is no mention of resolving the case of the party's state president there
 or isaki vajah he kendriya or rajyastareey netritv ke bich is mudde par khinchataan
 Despite the meeting between Bharatiya Janata Party national president Amit Shah and state Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, no decision could be taken on the state president of Rajasthan
 rajasthan ke 10 bade netaaon ko lekarmukhyamantri vasundhara rajene amit shah se mulaakaat kii thi
 On the other hand, BJP sources say that the BJP central leadership has made it clear that it is not in a mood to reconsider its decision to place Union Minister Gajendra Singh on the state head of Rajasthan BJP
 vasundhara is faisle ko maanane main bhale hi or vakt le len
 Tension persisted The party's public meeting discussed ways to win elections in Rajasthan, and then Vasundhara Raje and Amit Shah held a lengthy meeting to decide the name of the BJP state president
 haalanki bataaya ja rahaa he ki abhi tak donon hi netaa kisi ek naam par sahamat nahin ho paa rahe hai
 Vasundhara Raje and his supporters, the ministers in the Rajasthan government are still camping in Delhi

 Union Minister Gajendra Singh is also a Rajput and Vasundhara Raje also comes from both Jat and Rajput societies
 aise main is pad ke liye kisi duusari birdari kaa netaa hona jaruri hai
 The leaders involved in the meeting say that the national leaders of the BJP have made it clear that nobody has the courage to oppose Modi's choice Union Minister Gajendra Singh, so he should fight his own battle
 vasundhara raaje kaa dararajya menvidhansabha chunaavnovember main hai or aise main 60 din se zyada ho gaye rajasthan membijepika pradesh adhyaksh kaa pad khaali padaa hua he
 Till now no one has been appointed to the post of state president, preparations for the electoral strategy have not been started and now even after the meeting with Amit Shah, there is uneasiness among the party workers due to no decision
 gajendra singh kisi bhi tarah se aage jaakar unke liye koi khatra na ban jaaen ye baat vasundhara raaje ke man main baithi hui he
 The Vasundhara faction may think that the party's top command may present Gajendra Singh as the chief ministerial candidate, so she would never want any imposing person from the Center to become BJP state president in Rajasthan
 kendriya netaaon ke saath mushkil yah he ki vah jaanate hai ki rajya main bijepi kii ore se vasundhara raaje se zyada lokapriy koi netaa nahin he
 If the election is to be won, only Vasundhara can overcome the bjp's glory

 In his first reaction to the issue, Thackeray said in a signed statement addressing all MNS workers that countless cases have been registered against him and the activists since the party's inception in March 2006
 notice ke baad raaj ke chachere bhai or sattarudh sahyogi shivasena adhyaksh uddhav thakare unke samarthan main utar aae
 The ED issued summons to Raj Thackeray in connection with the investigation of a case and asked him to appear on Thursday
 uddhav ne apane awaas par mediakarmiyon se yah kehete hue apana paroksh samarthan jaahir kiya ki idi kii ore se unase (raaj thakare se) poochtacha main kuch bhi nahin nikalegaa
 Uddhav said, "I don't think the ed's questioning of him (raj Thackeray) tomorrow will yield any result
" " These days many leaders are fighting against Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be the face of opposition
 is kadi main samaajawaadee party ke pramukh akhilesh yadav ne modi or yogi sarkaar ke khilaaf sadak par utar kar sangharsh kaa elaan kiya he
 Akhilesh is starting the 'save the country-make country' campaign from August 9 on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of Quit India Movement
 is andolan ke jariye wo apni khoi hui siyaasi jameen ko jahaan ek taraf waapas paanaa chaahate hai to vahiin duusari taraf modi ke khilaaf ek majboot vipaksh kaa cheharaa banakar ubharne kii bhi koshish he
 Actually, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said in the Mann Ki Baat program only last week that the month of August is in a way a month of revolution
 is maheene ko kranti ke maheene ke rup main manaaya janaa chahie, taaki desh kii yuva peedi aazaadee ke liye hue kranti ko samaj sake
 The non-cooperation Movement started on 1 August and the Quit India Movement on 9 August 1942
 15 ko desh aaazaad hua
 Quit India is the 75th anniversary of the movement
 is andolan se judqar log angrej sarkaar ke khilaaf kandhe se kandhaa milakar andolan kaa hissaa ban gaye the
 At the behest of Gandhiji, millions of people were pushing themselves for freedom on the slogan of do or die
 1920 or 1942 main baapu ke andolan ke do rup dikhaai dete hai
 In response to Modi's August revolution, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav is raising the slogan of revolution against Modi and the Yogi government
 is andolan ke jariye sapa 2019 kaa chunavi aagaaj maanakar chal rahi he
 Attempts to bring back the base, Akhilesh Yadav suffered a crushing defeat in the state in the 2017 assembly elections
 unke party kaa janaadhar khiskkar bhaajapa ke kheme chalaa gaya he
 In such a situation, Akhilesh Yadav wants to revive his party base by rejuvenating the party worker so that he can win the 2019 war
 vipaksh kaa cheharaa banane kii jugatadrasal maujuuda daur mennarendra modike khilaaf vipaksh kaa koi aisa cheharaa nahin, jo modi kaa saamana kar sake
 While some time ago people were looking at Nitish Kumar as the face of opposition, but this place is completely empty due to his union with BJP
 aise main kshetreey kshatrap ke netaaon main nai ummid jaagi he
 This is the reason why Mamata Banerjee started the 'bhaga Bhagao' campaign on August 9 on the occasion of August revolution
 to vahiin akhilesh yadav ne bhi 9 agast se 'desh bachaao-desh banaao' abhiyaan aagaaj karne ja rahe hai
 Akhilesh Yadav is realizing that if he manages to blow the bugle against Modi, then surely he will become a strong face of the opposition
 yahi vajah he ki unhone agast kranti ke din ko chunaa he
 Which is directly related to the independence of the country
 sapa netaa bhi ye baat maan rahe hai ki akhilesh yadav saaf suthri chhavi ke netaa hai, unhone paanch saal upi ke mukhyamantri rahakar jo vikaas ke kaam kiye hai, utana kaam pichhali kisi bhi sarkaar main nahin ho sakaa he
 Rajendra Chaudhary, spokesperson of 2019 electoral party for SP, told Aaj Tak
- The Modi government has lost the country's fleet in three years
 bijepi sarkaar dwaara aloktantric taur-tareeke se asahmati kii aawaaj dabaai ja rahi he
 Farmers are devastated in Yogi Raj and women are vulnerable
 yahi nahin chaatro or naujavaanon ke bhavishya ke saath bhi khilwaad kiya ja rahaa he
 He informed that public voice will be raised strongly on August Revolution Day
 soobe ke sabhi jila mukhyalay par sapa kaaryakarta 'desh bachaao-desh banaao' abhiyaan ke tahat pradarshan karenge
 Akhilesh Yadav will also take part in Faizabad himself
 unhone kaha ki iske jariye sapa 2019 kaa chunavi aagaaj kar rahi he
 Chaudhary says that four months have passed since the Yogi government, but the people of the state have started remembering Akhilesh's tenure
 yakeen maniye yah khabar aapke dil ko cheer kar rakh degi
 
 13 saal kii ek bacchee sai shri marane se pehle ro-rokar apane pita se madad kii guhaar lagaati rahi
 
 or kahati rahi ki papa main mar rahi hum
 
 pleez mujhe bachaa lo
 
 
 But his compassionate request did not work, after all he died
 
 She continued to plead with her father before dying
 
 She kept showing her wounds
 
 She kept narrating her pain
 
 Kept on chanting 
 Father, have mercy
 
 Please save me
 
 Otherwise i will die
 
 i am your daughter too
 
 But do not know what kind of father he was
 
 Neither did he come to save her nor did he come to his funeral after death
 usne likhaa, 'papa aapke paas itane paise hone ke baavjood bhi aap mujhe treetment kyon nahin dilaa rahe hai
 
 main bhi to aapaki beti hum naa
 
 meraa zindaa rahanaa kya aapako acha nahin lagata
 
 aap mujhe kyon maarna chaahate hai
 
 'andhra pradesh ke vijaywada kii is 13 saal kii bacchee sai shri kaa video viral ho gaya he
 In the video, the girl is pleading with her father, father, i have got cancer! Please save me, otherwise i will die! Blisters have appeared everywhere on my body
 na to main khaanaa kha paa rahi hum
 
 na dawaaen
 
 
 She died due to lack of treatment for cancer
 
 Before dying, he requested his father for treatment
 
 But instead of getting treatment, Papa expelled him and his mother from the house
 
 When Sai Sri did not get help from anywhere before he died in pain, he made this pain load video
 papa, aapane kaha ki aapke paas paise nahin hai
 
 lekin hamaare paas ye ghar to he na
 
 pleez is ghar ko bech kar mere ilaaj kara dijie
 
 kyonki meri haalat ab bilkul bhi thik nahin he
 
 agar ilaaj nahin hua, to main zyada din jinda nahin rah paaungi
 
 pleez mujhe bachaa lijie
 
 main skool janaa chaahati hum
 
 agar mujhe kuch hua to aap hi meri maut ke zimmedaar honge
 Sai Sri died due to lack of cancer treatment in the hospital
 
 Now this video of him is going viral on social media
 
 But sadly this video took some time to go viral and by the time people came to know of Sai Shree's pain, she had gone from this world
 sai shri video main kah rahi he, 'papa ab to mere munh main bhi chhaale pad gaye hai
 
 jeebh ke upar bhi chhaale hai
 
 ek hafte ho gaye thik tarah se khaanaa bhi nahin kha pai hum
 
 jo bhi khaati hum ulti ho jaati he
 
 kuch bhi diguest nahin ho rahaa he
 
 yahaan tak kii ab to main medicine bhi nahin kha paa rahi hum
 
 pleez papa jaldi se aa jaao or mujhe treetment dilaao
 
 'badanaseeb sai shri jisase madad maang rahi thi wo pita nahin balki pathar dil ho chukaa tha
 
 or jab uske jism ne cancer ke dard ko bardaasht karne se manaa kar diya tab usne apane ummid chhod di or ye video banaakar usne apni maut ke liye apane pita ko zimmedaar tehraaya
 He said, 'I will report to the police station and also to the commissioner, and i am going to send my video to everyone
 
 If you do not come in two or three days after watching this video, then you will be responsible for my death
 
 Sai Sri died on Sunday, after which an NGO has complained to Sai Sri to the State Human Rights Commission
 enjio kaa aarope he ki paise hone ke baavjood pita ne beti kaa ilaaj nahin kiya or ab sthaneey vidhayak ke dabaav main police sai shri ke pita ke khilaaf cese bhi darj karne se manaa kar rahi he

 The scientist will land it lightly on the moon's south pole
 is ilaake main ab tak koi desh pahunch nahin sakaa he
 After China, Russia and America, India will be the fourth country to land a rover through a soft landing on the moon

 ' puraane based srinagar kii dhul bhari tang galiyon se rifat masudi kamyaabi kii mashaal banakar ubhari hai, vah bhi cricket ke balle banane ke us udyog main, jisamen mardon kaa dabadabaa rahaa he
 Why should it not be that they have fondly called him "batwoman"
 do bacchon kii maa rifat ne yah kaam 2003 main shuru kiya
 The 40-year-old bat manufacturing unit, Masoodi Arts and Sports, was under lock three years ago after the death of his father-in-law
 rifat bataati hai, maine apane shuhar shaukat se poocha ki kya main ise phir se shuru kar sakati hum or ve taiyaar ho gaye
 "shaukat made contact with the old workers, willows (wood dealers) and customers from outside Jammu and Kashmir
" shuruyaat main maal dene or bhugtan main deree sareekhee pareshaaniyaan ain
 "but the workers helped me a lot and made me what i am today," says Rifat, sitting in a dimly lit room with mud walls emblazoned with glossy finished MAS (masoodi Arts and Sports) bats
 ''rifat bataati hai ki bat banane main "sunar sareekhe hunar kii jarurat hoti he'', ek baar dekh kar aapako pataa chal janaa chahie ki balla sona he yaa bakawaas
 They examine each prepared bat themselves
 riyaj ahamed gani is bat ikai main do dashakon se zyada vakt se kaam kar rahe the, tabhi teen saal kii bandi ne unhen gaanv lautne or chote-mote kaam karne ko majaboor kar diya
 Now that Rifat has resumed business, he is happy and thankful that "his children did not suffer
" '' ve kehete hai, "yah akele unheen kii kamyaabi nahin he, balki hamaari bhi he
 a state government official involved in promoting start-ups says that governments have failed to prioritize this industry and take advantage of the huge demand for Kashmiri bats in the world
 ve kehete hai, "kashmiri brand ke balle rashtriya or antarrashtriya bazaaron main mushkil se hi dikhaai dete hai
 Raw bats from the Valley are illegally transported to other states where major brands put their stickers on them
 '' yahi vajah he ki rifat puri tarah taiyaar balle hi baahar jane detii hai taaki unka brand emeyes bats kashmir kaa naam raushan kare

 harfanmaulaa cricketer yuvaraj singhworld cap khilne vaali bhartiya timme nahin hai
 This is extremely sad for his millions of fans
 is jabanj khilaadi se bharatiyon ko hameshaa ummid rahati thi
 But the selectors did not choose him
 vaise bhi world cap ke liye chune gaye 30 khilaadiyon main vah shaamil nahin the
 But after his excellent performance in domestic cricket recently, expectations were aroused
 laga tha ki unke form main vaapasi ke saath team main bhi unki vaapasi ho jaaegi
 Yuvraj Singh (33) played a big role in India winning many important matches including World Cup
 lekin aisi kai vajahen raheen jis kaaran is shandaar khilaadi ko team main jagah nahin mili
 1
 yuvaraj kaa pichley dinon vanade cricket main pradarshan niraashajanak rahaa tha
 He had scored just one century and two half-centuries in his last 20 matches
 isse lagata tha ki unka jaadui tach khatm ho gaya he
 2
 unamem pehle jaisi ekaagratha nahin rahi
 The way he used to focus his attention on sports earlier, now he is no more in that
 unka confidence khatm hota ja rahaa tha
 3
 unki gendbaaji kii dhar bhi khatm hoti ja rahi thi
 He was also unable to bowl as before
 vaise saurashtra ke viruddh unhone acchhee gedbaaji kii
 He was always regarded as a good all-rounder in odis
 4
 Yuvraj has recovered from the deadly disease of cancer, but unfortunately his impact is visible on him
 unamem pehle jaisi furti nahin dikhti he
 He has improved both his health and sports through tremendous practice
 lekin iskaa bura asar dikh rahaa he
 5
 ravindra jadeja ne yuvaraj kii jagah le lee he
 Captain Dhoni has faith in him
 dhoni kii najaron main jadeja kahin acha kar sakate hai
 The BCCI too believed in Jadeja more than the Yuvraj
 jadeja lambey arase tak khel sakate hai, jabaki yuvaraj kaa kariyar samaapti kii ore he
 Jadeja is under age and can remain in the team for a long time
 6
 The technique and reflex of Yuvraj, who is returning after the illness, has also decreased
 vah uthati hui tej gendon ke saamne post hone lagate hai or australia main aisi hi genden milengi kyonki vahaan vicketen oochaal bhari hai
 7
 unki fitness bhi pehle jaisi nahin he or unka vajan bhi badha hua dikhataa he, jo shaayad dawaaiyon kaa asar he
 In such a situation, playing bets on them could be risky
 cricket yaa kisi bhi khel main nae khilaadiyon ko kahin zyada tarjeeh di jaati he taaki bhavishya main bhi team kii takat barkaraar rahe
 Yuvraj has a brilliant history, but now the team does not need him
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke chathe charan ke kareeb pahunchane ke bich ek nai adhyayan report jari kii gai he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki pichley paanch saal main desh main hue vibhinn chunaavon main kul raashi dedh lakh karod rupee se upar kii raashi kharch kii gai or isamen se aadhe se adhik dhan behisaab sroton se aayaa tha
 The study conducted by the Center for Media (CMS) comes at a time when many political parties are accusing each other of using black money in the Lok Sabha elections this time
 saat april ko shuru yah chunaav 12 may tak chalegaa
 So far, polling has been held for 232 Lok Sabha seats in five phases, while 311 seats are to be voted in the remaining four phases
 is dauraan nirvachan ayog ne kaledhan ke prayog par nigaraanee tej karte hue deshbhar main badi maatra main nakadi or anya pratibandhit chijen baraamad kii hai
 According to a CMS study, more than Rs 1,50,000 crore was spent during several elections in India in the last five years
 tees hajaar karod rupee loksabhaa chunaavon par kharchasiemes ke chairman en
 Bhaskar Rao said that this is a rough estimate
 is baari bharkam raashi main se aadhe se adhik raashi kalaadhan he
 The use of black money for elections is the mother of all corruption in our country
 report main kaha gaya he ki dedh lakh karod rupee main se 20 pratishat yaa 30,000 karod rupee chaalu lok sabha chunaavon main kharch kiye jane kaa anumaan he
 a third of this total amount, or Rs 45,000 to 50,000 crore, was spent in the state assembly elections
 das hajaar karod rupee jila parishad ke chunaavon par kharchareport ke mutabik kareeb 30,000 karod rupee panchayaton ke chunaavon par, 20,000 karod rupee mandalon ke liye, 15,000 karod rupee nagar nigamon ke liye or 10,000 karod rupee jila parishadon ke liye kharch kiye gaye
 The report said that the media campaign in the Lok Sabha elections (25 percent) and the pre-election expenses (20 to 25 percent) by the ruling parties are a significant part of it
 chote chunaavon main media par bhi kharch kayeedhyayan ke mutabik chote chunaavon main chijen alag hoti hai
 The expenditure on media is very less and the expenditure on rallies in Mandals and Panchayats is negligible
 unhone daawa kiya ki sthaneey chunaavon main raajnneetik dalon dwaara kharch 10 pratishat se kam hota he, jabaki loksabhaa chunaav main yah 20 pratishat hota he
 On the other hand, in the case of Lok Sabha, a lot of money is spent by a candidate to get a party ticket

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special news letter koi bhi naam jab bhagwaan yaa devi-devataaon ke saath jud jaataa he to uski ahmiyat or bhi bad jaati he
 This ranges from places to their riders
 kya aapane is baat par gaur kiya he ki kisi bhagwaan ne kyon apane liye vah khaas sawari chuni
 For example, Vishnu rides Lord Garuda and Indra Dev Airavat comes on the elephant
 vaise hi maa lakshmi kaa vaahan he ullu to maa durga karti hai sher kii sawari
 But why did the Almighty God require these riders, when they can move anywhere in a moment with their divine powers? There are spiritual, scientific and practical reasons behind it
 aaie jaane kaise
 
 
 Lord Vishnu and Garudagarud symbolize divine powers and authority
 bhagavad gita main kaha gaya he ki bhagwaan vishnu main hi sara sansar samaaya he
 This large golden colored bird also indicates this
 bhagwaan vishnu kii divyata or adhikaar kshamta ke liye yah sabase sahi pratik he
 Moushika is the vehicle of Lord Ganesha and Mushak Ganesh Ji
 mooshak shabd sanskrit ke mush se bana he jiskaa arth he lootnaa yaa churaana

 Ganesha's sitting on a rat is a sign that he has conquered selfishness and has awakened the sense of Janakalyan
 shiv or nandishiv bholebhaale sidhe chalane vaale lekin kabhi-kabhi bhayankar krodh karne vaale devtaa hai to unka vaahan hai nandi yani bail
 It is a symbol of strength, faith and trust
 iske atirikt bhagwaan shiv kaa charitra moh maaya or bhautik ichchhaaon se pare rahane vaala bataaya gaya he
 The bull ie Nandi perfectly characterizes these characteristics and is therefore the vehicle of Shiva
 kartikeya or mayurakartikeya kaa vaahan he mayur
 According to a legend, this vehicle was found in an offering from Lord Vishnu
 bhagwaan vishnu ne kartikeya kii sadhak kshamtaaon ko dekhakar unhen yah vaahan diya tha jiskaa sankethik arth tha ki apane chanchal man rupi mayur ko kartikeya ne saadh liya he
 Maa Durga and Sheerdurga are symbols of fast, power and strength, and they are accompanied by lions
 sher pratik he aakraamakata or shaury kaa
 These three characteristics are also seen in the conduct of Maa Durga
 yah bhi rochak he ki sher kii dahaad ko maa durga kii dhwani hi mana jaataa he jiske aage sansar kii baaki sabhi awaajen kamjor lagati hai
 Maa Saraswati and Hanshans have been considered a symbol of purity and curiosity which is the best vehicle for Mother Saraswati, the Goddess of knowledge
 maa saraswati kaa hans par virajman hona yah bataata he ki gyaan se hi jigyaasa ko shant kiya ja saktaa he or pavitrataa ko jas kaa tas rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Maa Lakshmi and Ulluman Lakshmi's vehicle owls are considered to be the oddest selection
 kaha jaataa he ki ullu thik se dekh nahin paata, lekin aisa sirf din ke samay hota he
 Owls are a symbol of auspicious time and wealth

 public toilet yuj karnaa apane aap main kisi chunauti se kam nahin he
 The stinking smell, the dirt that compels the eyes to close
 public toilet yuj karne kaa sidhaa matlab he, bimariyon ko nyotaa dena
 Despite this, we all have to use public restrooms at some point in compulsion
 koi toilet seat yuj karne se pehle flush karata he to koi puri seat par tissue paper bichhaakar baithta he
 If you do something similar then tell you that doing so can be dangerous for you
 seat par toilet paper bichhaakar baithte samay ham sochate hai ki isse infections nahin hoga, lekin aisa sochna galat he
 According to a news from the Huffington Post, laying toilet paper on a toilet seat does not reduce the risk of infection
 is report ke anusaar, toilet paper bichaane se bacteria ke jamaa hone kii ashanka bahut bad jaati he
 In such a situation, by laying paper, you do the work of inviting bacteria only and only
 jitne bacteria toilet seat par hote hanutane hi flush handle par bhi hote hai
 The same thinking is behind making the toilet seat smooth and curved so that bacteria will stick less on it
 jab ham toilet seat par toilet paper bichhaakar baithte hai to isamen bahut adhik sankhya main bacteria jamaa ho jate hai
 Due to which the risk of infection increases manifold
 aise main public toilet yuj karne waalon ko salaah di jaati he ki wo toilet yuj karne se pehle flush karnaa na bhoolen
 Also wash hands thoroughly after toilet
 paper towel se haath pochhen
 Using an electric hand dryer is not right
 isse bacterial infections ho saktaa he saath hi viral partical bhi udakar sharir main pravesh kar sakate hai

 Apart from the rhetoric, the Congress leaders of rhetoric are unable to present a convincing argument
 ye kaisaa sawaal?kya sarkaar rahul gandhi ko unke number kaa juuta banavaakar dene vaali he? ye sawaal loksabhaa main congress ke netaa mallikarjun khadge ne poocha tha
 With this sarcastic question, he said that the Congress vice-president has got SPG protection so that all the news would be passed on to the government
 phir iske liye form bharwane kii kya jarurat thi?is par sarkaar daleel he ki rajeev gandhi kii hatya ke baad unki pahchaan unke juute kii sies se kii gai thi

 "but if we look at the media report, it is known that only a few police officers are now considering it as just a paper document
 vaise ye vyavastha tab banaai gai thi jab viviipi ke bare main har kisi ko itani jaankaree nahin hoti thi

 The public opinion in Rajasthan may have been in favor of the Congress, but the results of the Sirohi assembly seat were shocking for both the Congress and the BJP
 is seat se jahaan desh ke pehle go paalan mantri ban charchaa main aae otaraam devasi chunaav haar gaye to vahiin congress apni jamaanat tak nahin bachaa pai

 Vasundhara Raje herself held the two seats in the district where BJP has won
 lekin idhar sirohi seat par bijepi rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke aam sabha karne ke baavjood bijepi apni seat nahin bachaa pai
 The important thing is that this seat of Sirohi Assembly is a normal seat and for the third time, Otaram Devasi was in the fray from BJP
 otaraam devasi pichhadaa varg (obisi) se aate hai
 Keeping this equation in mind, the Congress fielded Jeevaram Arya (OBC) against him
 congress kii is ranneeti kaa asar yah hua ki uski ore se khud ko daavedaar maan rahe sanyam lodha baagi ho gaye or nirdaleey hi maidan main utar gaye
 Ottaram Dewasi was the first cow rearing minister in the country during the Vasundhara government tenure in Rajasthan
 unhen congress ke baagi ummidavaar sanyam lodha ne 10,253 maton ke antar se haraa diya
 This was Dewasi's third election from Sirohi assembly seat and he had defeated the same candidate twice in his previous elections
 lekin tab sanyam lodha congress ke tikat par chunaav lade the
 This time the Congress played bets on the new face and fielded Jeevaram Arya
 lekin jeevaram arya maatr 14,656 hi hasil kar saken or apni jamaanat tak nahin bachaa paae
