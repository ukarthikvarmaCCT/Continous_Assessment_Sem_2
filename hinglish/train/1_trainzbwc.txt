' unhone kaha ki aise to vyrai ne bhi kaha tha ki is desh ko purna swatantraaa kii jarurat nahin he
 The Lt
 Governor who is speaking the language of the Viceroy and Churchill also said that India cannot be given independence
 yahaan ke log apana rajya chalaa nahin sakate he
 i think they are speaking the language of Churchill or Viceroy
 'haal main kejariwal sarkaar ne aam aadmi bas kaa trial ran shuru kiya he
 As the Transport Minister, Satendra Jain was asked the question of sending the file to the Uparpal, and he laughed and said, 'the file has not been sent yet
 abhi tak uparajyapal ne mangai nahin he, maangenge to bhej denge
 ' desh main chunavi mausam ek baar phir aa gaya he
 The BJP, which is a jerk in the Delhi and Bihar elections, does not want to leave any stone unturned in the coming elections and that is why Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah have already started to fit political pieces
 is salpanch rajyon main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavonor agle saal upi or punjab ke chunaavon main kamyaabi ke liye bijepi vot bank kii politics dhyaan main rakhkar kadam badha rahi he
 If we look at the recent events and statements, the bjp's agenda is clearly visible
 bijepi ke agenda main shaamil hai ye baaten-1- rashtrawaad:jeenyu se shuru hui rashtrawaad kii ladaai ab bijepi ke liye naak kaa sawaal ban gai he
 Whether it is the issue of raising anti-national slogans or not speaking 'bharat Mata ki Jai'
 haal hi main bijepi rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main khudpradhanmantri narendra modine rashtrawaad ko party kii takat bataaya
 He said, 'nationalism is our strength and we will take it forward
 ' bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne bhi baithak main kaha ki party kisi bhi surat main desh kaa apmaan bardaasht nahin kar sakati
 The way the BJP is constantly raising the issue of nationalism, obviously it will try its best to take advantage of it even in elections
 2- dalit adhikaar:bijepi ne jis teji ke saath dalit adhikaron kaa mudda uthaaya he usase saaf pataa chalata he ki vah aane vaale chunaavon main bhi ise bhunaayegi
 Although she does not see much benefit in the recent elections of five states, but in the elections of UP and Punjab, she will use it as a vote bank
 bijepi ne daliton ko rijhaane ke liye na sirf aarakshan ke mudde ko uthaaya balki baba sahab ambedkar ko bhi apana iken banaakar pesh kiya he
 On the occasion of the foundation stone of the Ambedkar memorial, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called himself a 'devotee of Baba Saheb'
 unhone yah bhi kaha, 'aarakshan koi khatm nahin kar saktaa
 Some people are spreading confusion about reservation
 ' saaf he ki bijepi bihar chunaavon ke dauraan aarakshan kii bahes se hue nuksaan ko dobaaraa nahin jhelana chaahati or yahi vajah he ki pradhanmantri se lekar bijepi adhyaksh tak aarakshan kii vakaalat lagbhag har sabha main kar rahe hai
 3- Will increase status here: Elections are held in West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Kerala in april-may
 pashchim bengal main jahaan trinmul congress dobaaraa satta main waapas aane ke liye puraa jor laga rahi he to vahiin assam main congress ne bhi ek baar phir sarkaar banane kaa dam bharaa he
 BJP has not got power here yet
 tamilnadu or kerala main bijepi ko abhi pair jamaana he
 The dream of power for the BJP in these two states is far-fetched, the party will have to run a long race to sit in the opposition here
 beete dinon 'india today conklev' main khud bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha tha ki tamilnadu or kerala jaise rajyon main bijepi sirf apni asardaar upasthiti dikhaanaa chaahati he or haisiyat main ijapha karnaa chaahati he
 He said, 'in those states we are fighting to register our presence, not to sit in power
 'iske alaava, upi or punjab main bhi bijepi ko kadi mashkkat kerani padegi
 It will be a big challenge to maintain the vicissitudes of political speculation by winning 73 seats in Yuri in the Lok Sabha elections
 saath hi punjab main bhi aam aadmi party ke badhate asar ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In such a situation, the BJP will have to fight a tough battle to strengthen its position here
 abhinetri aalia bhatta kaa kahana he ki aagaamee film 'udata punjab' main unka kirdaar karina kapur kii takkar main nahin he
 Alia told, "I am not competing with Kareena in the film 'udta Punjab'

 " 'udata punjab' main aalia pehali baar kisi anya abhinetri ke saath bhoomika nibhaaengi
 Asked if you feel a match with fellow actresses in Bollywood? In response, Alia said, "competition is an integral part of life, but i don't think anyone should pay much attention to what is happening around

 " test cricket main mahendra singh dhoni kii wicketcaping kii aalochana karte hue newjiland ke purv captain martin kro ne kaha he ki bhartiya captain thakaan or lagaataar khilne ke kaaran sirf 'stopper' ban gaye hai
 Crowe wrote in his column on ESPN Cric Info, much has been said and written about MS Dhoni's decline in wicketkeeping levels
 ati vyast kaarykram ke kaaran vah sirf stopper banakar rah gaye hai
 "in the latest Test series between India and England, we have seen the dice of both the teams turning again and again and the role of wicketkeepers had become important in them
" stump ke peeche urja ke abhaav kaa asar gendbaaji or fielding par padataa he or bharat ne iskaa khamiyaja bhugta
 Crowe said Dhoni should be given a break in the Test, as he is playing the most cricket
 unhone kaha, ab us par iskaa asar pad rahaa he or thake hue dimag or dhalate sharir ke saath bharat test cricket main field par lambey samay nahin tik saktaa
 If you pay your tax honestly and do not expect any kindness from the government, then you must be irritated that this is the last opportunity that comes again and again and only to tax evaders and black money earners
 is
 beete saptaah pradhanmantri ne 'man kii baat' main kaale dhan kii svaichhik ghoshnaa kii nai skim ko jab aakhri mauka kaha to ve darasal itihaas ko nakaar rahe the
 The reality is that the new scheme is not the last but another new opportunity to get rid of the sins of black money (domestic)
 aam karadaataaon ke liye sahuliyatein bhale na badi hon lekin aazaadee ke baad lagbhag har dashak main ek aisi skim jarur ai he jo kar choron ko pavitra hone kaa ekamusth mauka detii he
 The ethical questions of the schemes for granting amnesty to tax evaders have always been big because it is an open injustice to honest taxpayers
 isliye zyaadaatar desh vishesh halaat main hi aisi pahal karte hai
 The repetition of the amnesty schemes in India had already addressed the questions of morality, now its grand failure is a big challenge for the credibility of the administration
 lekin iske baad bhi sarkarein yah jua khilne se nahin hichaktin
 The NDA government is the second government in the last 65 years (three schemes in 1965) that has brought two schemes of forgiveness of punishment (after paying tax) to tax evaders within two years
 achraj tab or bad jaataa he jab hamen yah pataa ho ki 2015 main videsh main jamaakale dhan kii mahatvakankshi svaichhik ghoshnaa kii skimsuper flop rahi
 Of this, only Rs 3,770 crore
 kaa kaala dhan ghoshit hua or sarkaar ke khajaane main mahaj 2,262 karod ru
 Tax came iske baad ek or skim samaj, niyat or naitikta par gambhir sawaal khadey karti he
 The "last" occasions of repeated tax evaders have a long history, but it is necessary to go through this so that we can get a sense of government sympathy for the black earners often and find that the DNA of these schemes i am wrong
 aazaadee mili chaar saal hi beete the jab 1951 main pehali walentary discloger skim ai
 This window, known as Tyagi Scheme (then Revenue and Expenditure Minister Mahavir Tyagi), was only Rs 70 crore
 kaa kaala dhan or 10-11 karod ru
 Could collect tax because people were not confident of further action
 1965 bharat-paak yuddh kaa varsh tha
 There were three schemes that year
 inamen ek sicks forty skim thi or duusari blike skim
 The tax rate of both was high so only Rs 49 crore
 kaa tex mila
 The same year the government issued National Defense Gold Bonds to raise black money in which the details of the investors were kept confidential but the bonds were not very popular
 immergency kii chaaya main 1975 main ai skim main company or vyaktigat aay ko ghoshit karne or 25 se 60 fisadi tex dene par sajaa se maafee kaa praavdhaan tha
 241 crore only from the scheme
 kaa rajasav mila
 1,000 in 1978 Rs
 ke note band karke kaale dhan ko simit karne kii koshish hui
 Special bonds were issued in 1981 for black money investment in which the returns were tax free which were not very successful
 kaali sampatti kii ghoshnaa par 1985 main iskar vibhaag ne chhot ke praavdhaan kiye or 1986 main indira vikaas patr laae gaye jo kaali kamai ke nivesh kaa mauka dete the
 The National Housing Deposit Scheme of 1991 also failed to extract black earnings
 1991 kii fahrren exange remitance skim or neshnal deveopment bond main kaale dhan kii ghoshnaa par maafee kaa praavdhaan tha
 These bonds were relatively successful, but the 1993 Gold Bond Scheme was not supported
 1997 kii vidiies akeli skim thi jo 33,697 karod ru
 k black money and Rs 9,729 crore
 ke tex ke saath sabase safal prayog thi
 History is proof that the design of black money waiver schemes are almost same, only the tax penalty rates have been different
 yah scimen soochnaaon kii gopneeyata ke prati kabhi bhi bharosa nahin jagaa sakin, balki baad ke kuch maamalon main tex kii padtaal ne vishwaas ko kamjor hi kiya
 Owing to higher tax rates, the black money holders were not enthusiastic about the voluntary declaration
 in skiimon ke baar-baar aane se kaala dhan to baahar nahin aayaa or na hi kaali kamai ke kaarkaane band hue, alabatta in skiimon ke kaaran kar prashasan kaa utsaah or rasookh tut gaya
 Everyone knows from the tax system to the market that the last such opportunity will come again in every decade
 isliye ek baar safai ke baad, kaali kamai jutaney vaale agali skim kaa intjaar karne lagate hai
 In 1971, based on the study of the last three schemes, the Wanchoo Committee had said that we are confident that any scheme of tax apology or black money declaration will not only fail, but will erode the trust of the honest taxpayer and the enthusiasm of the tax administration
 isliye bhavishya main scimen nahin aani chahie
 In 1985, the Shankar Acharya Committee said that efforts to limit black money did not benefit from these schemes
 asafalataa ko dohraane kii ek seemaa hoti he lekin bharat me kaale dhan par maafee kii scimen to vifaltaaon kaa dharawahik ban chuki hai
 After adopting almost all the methods of bringing out black money in the last six-seven decades and even after failing, it should not be doubted that these schemes are brought only because black once every decade It is necessary to give the money-keepers an opportunity to escape, because apart from this, nothing else has been gained from these schemes
 team india ke captain viraat kohli apane kariyar ke vyastatam daur se guzar rahe hai

 Neither i am a runaway nor a fugitive, it is not the face of a poet's poem, but the tweet of Vijay Mallya, who went abroad under the rules of his will
 vijay maalya ji videsh kya chale gaye hai desh main rahane vaale do dalon ke netaa or system ko kamazor aadmi ke anukool banane vaale log bahes kar rahe hai
 It is getting very bad that people feel bad about going abroad
 aakhir maalya ji kisi se udhaar maang kar to nahin gaye hai
 They have no shortage of money
 apana to he hi, dusron kaa bhi paisa he unke paas
 There is a loan taken from many banks
 mumbai kii ek adaalat main ek maamla chal rahaa he ki sarvice tex kaa bhi paisa he jo unhone aapse lekar sarkaar ko nahin die
 If such a person is not eligible to go abroad, then who is
 aap inhen to jaanate hi honge
 If anyone has understood Vijay Mallya properly, it is Farooq Abdullah, the former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha ki vijay maalya ne desh ke liye bahut munafa kamaaya he
 Now when it comes to the country, the matter can be centi
 par ek chota sa sawaal he ki jab desh ke liye munafa kama rahe the to desh ke bainkon ko hazaron karod kaa ghaataa kaise ho gaya
 Did all those banks belong to Maldives Malta
 main to faruk sahab kii baat par bhavuk ho gaya ki maalya ne desh ke liye munafa kamaaya he
 Such a person goes abroad after so much hard work and there is a ruckus, how unfair it is
 suniye abdulla sahab ko
 i wish someone would even say to farmers that it is natural to fail in farming
 11 march ke hi din pichley saal mausam kii maar se hazaron kisaan karz main dub gaye the
 Half of the farming fails due to nature
 acha he kisaan log twitor par nahin hai, shaayad tivi bhi nahin dekhte honge
 Don't know, the channel entangles them in the ghost story and the story of the five thousand year old sword
 jo khubi faruk abdulla sahab ko vijay maalya main nazar ai wo baat sharad yadav ko nazar nahin ai
 Sharad ji will definitely be a negative person
 vaise us vakt ve vijay maalya ko lekar kaaphi positive rahe honge jab vijay ji unki party ke varisht upaadhyaksh the
 a year later, that in 2003, if Mallya had not left Janata Dal United, then there would have been a press conference in Patna
 vijay maalya ji kehete hai ki ve antarrashtriya bijnesaman hai
 They travel abroad
 saansad hone ke naate ve kanoon kaa sammaan karte hai
 Our judiciary is much better and respected
 to rahi baat sammaan kii to unke bayanon se lagata to he ki ve sammaan main koi kami nahin karte hai
 If they have problems, then through media trial
 baad main unhone ek duusare twit main sanket diya ki media unka trial karegaa to ve bhi media kaa trial kar sakate hai
 He tweets, 'media bosses should not forget that i have helped and held them for many years, whose documents are also present
 isliye tiarapy ke liye koi jhooth nahin chalegaa
 ' ab is tarah kaa twit karenge to koun unke bare main kya bolegaa
 They don't know who is teaching them all to get behind the media
 badi mushkil se to media ko peeche padane ke liye koi mila he or ye hai ki kah rahe hai ki media ke hi peeche pad jaaenge wo bhi dacument lekar
 Is it not so that Lalit Modi ji has seduced Mallya
 pichley saal lalit modi bhi isi tarah twit kar sabake peeche pad gaye the
 In the end, the same thing happened that everyone forgot Lalit Modi together
 varna unhen lekar sab ek duusare kii hi pole kholane lage the
 My message to those who are desperate to see Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya is not to worry
 jab bhi bada aadmi bane kam se kam do raajnneetik dalon kaa khyaal zarur rakhen or inase kuch batch jaae to media kaa bhi
 Keep his document and when someone questions, tweet that we will tell everyone
 pataa nahin kiskaa video or kiskaa kis avasthaa main photo nikal jaae, pataa chalaa ki unhen lekar kuch or bavaal ho gaya
 Surely everyone must be celebrating inside that if they have gone abroad, stay there
 aane kii kya zarurat he
 There is a lot of discussion of the Art of Living nowadays, but in Mallya's case, the Art of Living means the art of escape
 times of india ne shuukravaar ko report chhaapi he ki maalya sahab ne 2 march dopaher kii jet airways kii flit pakadi, firstclas main savaar hue or landan chale gaye
 The Times of India has quoted reports quoting sources that they have carried seven heavy bags with them
 ishwar se yahi prarthana he ki media ke logon vaala dastavej un saaton bag main na ho
 It will be cash clothes, but if they remove it and start tweet then it can be amazing
 indian express kii khabar ke anusaar maalya sahab landan jane se pehle 1 march ko rajyasabha gaye the
 According to the attendance record on the Rajya Sabha website, Mallya was present in the House on March 1
 kitni acchhee baat he
 He also went to Parliament to work for the country before going abroad
 phir kyon sab unke peeche pade hai mujhe samaj nahin aata jabaki maine to unki kingfisher flite se sirf wo laal vaala year phone hi liya tha
 There is a good news for those who are disappointed with Mallya going abroad
 enditivi dot com ke anusaar pravartan nideshaalay ne unhen 18 march ko mumbai bulaayaa he taaki unase mani laundry ke ek cese main poochtacha kar sake
 This week, the Enforcement Directorate has filed a money laundering case
 aarope he ki unhone idibiai bank se 900 karod kaa karz liya he or galat tareeke se videsh bhej diya he
 That is, they do not go abroad by themselves, they also send money abroad
 kab tak hamaara rupaya dollar ke mukaable kamazor hota rahegaa
 Even when i came out, i roamed around
 vijay maalya jis tarah se nyaaypalika or kanoon ke sammaan par jor de rahe hai us hisaab se 16-17 dinon ke liye videsh janaa koi badi baat to nahin he
 When he went to London on 2 March, there was no notice against him
 vitt mantri arun jetali kaa bayaan he ki jis din maalya ne desh choda us din bank ne apni kanoonee prakriya shuru nahin kii thi
 Till then, there was no order from any agency to stop them from leaving the country
 congress netaa gulam ali azaad vitt mantri jetali ke is daawey ko chunauti de rahe hai
 He says the CBI had issued a lookout notice for Vijay Mallya last November but that was changed a month later
 pehla notice ye tha ki dekhte hi giraftaar kar liya jaae
 According to Azad, it was later that only his visits be monitored
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki jisane desh kaa 9000 karod rupaya churaayaa ho use desh se kaise bhaagane diya gaya
 Finance Minister Jaitley also replied that in Congress time, thousands of crores of loans were given to Mallya
 azaad kaa kahana he ki bina sarkaar kii bhagidaari ke maalya bhaag nahin sakate
 The government says that Mallya cannot get a loan without his help when the opposition was in government
 ab aap hi bataaiye ki doshi koun he
 The first one is now the one
 bataane se pehle yaad rakhiyegaa ki maalya sahab saat baari bharkam bag lekar gaye hai
 Don't tell me that something goes out of your bag against you
 kya vaaki maalya ko baahar jane main madad di gai
 Why his look out notice was changed
 jabaki vitt mantri bhi maan rahe hai ki 30 november tak maalya ji par maatr 9 hazaar 91 karod kaa karz tha
 There is so much debt on someone, no one noticed the possibility of his escape
 ho saktaa he
 The amount is so large that everyone's attention must have been spent in counting
 vaise vitt mantri ne ek or udhaaharan se samajhane kaa prayaas kiya ki kwatroki ke bhaagane or maalya ke bhaagane main kyon fark he
 When authorities in Switzerland reported that Quattrocchi was a beneficiary of the Bofors scandal, k Madhavan wrote a letter asking that his passport be confiscated, the government did not stop him and he left the country within two days
 wo ek aapraadhik maamla tha
 This statement reveals the exploits of the Congress, but what happened in Mallya's case gives an answer
 ek puraani ghatana kaa yahaan zikr karnaa chahie
 In January 2015, Priya Pillai, a member of Greenpeace NGO, was barred from going to London
 ve bhaag kar nahin ja rahi thim balki adivaasiyon ke haq main awaz uthaane landan ja rahi thim
 The IB is said to have a lookout notice against him
 teen maheene baad march 2015 main dilli hai court ne priya pillai ke bare main faisla sunaaya ki sarkaar kii niti ke anusaar kisi ke bolne yaa kisi ke haq ke liye Cannot abolish the right to fight
 isliye priya pillai ke passport se of lod remark ko hataaya jaae
 His name should be removed from the list of not being allowed out of the country
 pillai ne bataaya, 'mujhe airport par bataaya gaya ki aap desh se baahar nahin ja sakati hai
 i had all the documents
 mere khilaaf jaanch nahin thi
 There was no case
 phir bhi mujhe roka gaya
 It was a surprise mere khilaaf koi lukout notice bhi jari nahin tha
 ' par kya vijay maalya ke khilaaf koi maamla bhi nahin chal rahaa tha
 a few examples show that they have been circling the courts for a long time or that many departments have been circling the courts to recover from them
 agast 2014 main vijay maalya bangaloru kii ek vishesh adaalat main pesh hote hai
 The Income Tax Department had filed three cases against him
 bangaloru vaala maamla yah he ki vijay maalya ne 400 karod rupee kaa tex sarkaar ko nahin diya tha
 Mallya sahib was granted bail on a bond of one lakh rupees
 adaalat ne aadesh diya ki ve trial main sahyog karenge
 The Income Tax Department had argued that Mallya would not be able to help in the proceedings that he was a non-resident Indian (NRI)
 baahar aate jate rahete hai
 So they may not cooperate in the trial
 ve ek prabhavi bijnesaman bhi hai or satta ke galiyaaron main unka kaaphi rasookh hai
 Another case against him was going on in a court in Mumbai
 aarope tha ki maalya sahab ne upabhoktaaon se liya gaya sarvice tex kaa paisa sarkaar ko nahin diya he
 In this case, he was granted bail by the trial court of Mumbai in February 2015
 sarvice tex vibhaag ne is faisle ko agast 2015 main bobe hoicourt main chunauti di
 On March 11, ie, the Bombay High Court today heard in this case, the service tax department had to hear a lot
 hai court ne kaha ki agar aap nichali adaalat ke zamaanat dene ke faisle se khush nahin the to aapane agast 2015 tak intazaar kyon kiya
 Why have not the lookout notices been issued against them till date, which you want to call for hearing
 or to or vibhaag ko is baat ke liye bhi sunanaa padaa ki uske kaagazat puure nahin he
 The case was that Mallya's company Kingfisher Airlines had not paid 32 crore service tax to the government after recovering from consumers
 sarvice tex vibhaag kaa kahana tha ki maalya kaa passport zabt kar liya jaae lekin court ne kaha tha ki aap ye baat sabit nahin kar paa rahe hai ki maalya adatan apradhi hai
 The second thing is that Mallya has given in writing that if he is present on every hearing, then it does not become a matter that the passport be confiscated
 vijay maalya ne baar baar kaha he ki ve adaalat kaa sammaan karte hai or kanoonee karrwai main madad karte hai, lekin is ghatana se lagata he ki unhone adaalat ke shuruaati bharose ko bhi todaa he
 Both the Income Tax Department and the Service Tax Department feared that Mallya could leave the country as an NRI and it also indicated that these departments did not make concerted efforts to stop Mallya
 bade logon ke maamle main is tarah kii choti galatiyaan ho jaati hai
 The special thing is that such mistakes happen in every government
 patrkaar shekhar gupta ne chalate chalate main state bank of india kii pramukh arundhati bhattacharya se baat kii he
 You will be convinced with his talk that it is not so easy to get victory against Mallya
 in teen udaahranon se gyaat hota he ki vijay maalya ke kilaaf vibhageeya karrwai chal rahi thi
 RBI Chief Raghuram Rajan's statement was also coming in the media that people like Mallya should not spend royalty, this leads to wrong messages among people
 raajnneetik dalon ke alaava tamaam vibhaagon kii meharbaaniyon ko aap kis khate main daalenge
 In one of their seven bags, or in another bag
 bhartiya state bank apane 1500 karod kii vasuuli ke liye maalya ji ko khoj rahaa he
 All banks want to recover their own money
 maalya ne apane bayaan main kaha he ki ve bainkon se baat kar maamla sulajhane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai lekin state bank of india kii pramukh arundhati bhattacharya ne shekhar gupta se kuch or kaha
 We had offered Vijay Mallya for one time settlement
 unhone baat to shuru to kii lekin koi aupchaarik jawaab nahin diya
 That is why we were repeatedly telling the court to give us the asset under Oath
 asset under oth ye he ki aapke paas jitani sampatti he aap court ko likhakar den ki hamaare paas ye sampatti he or main isamen se apana lone de duungaa
 When we gave another chance to Kingfisher Airlines, they gave their personal guarantee
 isliye un par asset under oth kaa concept lagu hota he
 i want to say that we are the same team
 ham sabko milakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Kingfisher Airlines was going through a loss in 2012 when the UPA government wanted to help it
 jiskaa bijepi ne virodh kiya tha
 Due to this, the UPA ministers gave a statement that the government is not trying to save Kingfisher
 kuch hi maheenon baad kingfisher ko bhartiya state bank se 1500 karod kaa lone mil gaya
 In this whole matter, there is no talk of officers or directors taking decisions within the banks in favor of Mallya
 kya ve puri tarah nirdosh rahe honge
 Now the question is whether Vijay Mallya has the property to repay the debt of seven thousand crores
 ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhiyegaa
 The whole matter is in court
 adaalat se hi tay hoga ki un par kitni dendaree banati he
 How much will you pay and how much will be the punishment
 phir bhi ek motaa moti baat ho jaani chahie ki unke paas apana kitna he
 Farooq Abdullah says that Mallya has made a profit for the country
 ab aap state bank of india kii arundhati ji kii bhi suniye
 For which country is she fighting so much to recover her bank losses
 baharhaal maalya sahab ko lekar tarah tarah ke bayaan aa rahe hai
 i do not agree with one word of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray's statement as he has called Vijay ji a white collar terrorist
 phir bhi uddhav thakare kii nirbhikta se laga ki unke bare main to vijay maalya ke paas pakkaa koi saboot nahin hoga
 Those who were screaming after Lalit Modi ran away will have to answer how Mallya ran
 daaud ko laane ke liye sarkaar pakistan ke saamne yachana kar rahi he
 But the white collar terrorist has fled in front of his eyes
 maalya bhaag jayega yah desh kaa doodh peetaa baccha bhi bataa rahaa he
 But the government did not understand that this was a surprise
 maalya kii partiyon main parosi sharaab kaa nasha ab bhi kaiyon ke ragon main daud rahaa he
 It will be only after his landing
 bijepi pravaktaa shrikant sharma ne kaha he ki congress ne apane kaarykaal main vijay maalya ko jamkar luutane kii chhot di he
 This means that BJP also believes that Mallya has looted
 to aane vaale dinon main bijepi ye imtahaan degi ko wo maalya ko bilkul nahin chhodane vaali he
 Manish Tiwari of the Congress has asked which BJP MLA voted to make Vijay Mallya a member of Rajya Sabha
 jab bhi donon partiyaan ek duusare kii pole kholti hai ummid bad jaati he ki ab sab baahar aa jayega
 But then the curtain falls and another issue arises
 ummid he vijay maalya kaa maamla lalit modi kii tarah thanda nahin padegaa
 Anyway, if the decision of the Enforcement Directorate is implemented, Mallya can come to India on 18 March
 tippaniyan If big people like Vijay Mallya are not saved, then small people will believe in becoming big
 isse hamaari arthvyavastha ke growth rate ko nuksaan pahunch saktaa he or videshi niveshkon main dar paidaa ho saktaa he
 Whether banks will be able to recover their money by seizing Vijay Mallya's assets will depend on how soon the media forgets Vijay Mallya's issue like it did in the case of Lalit Modi
 agar aapane bank kaa lone liya he or chukaa nahin paa rahe hai to aapke liye ek sanvaidhanik chetavanee he
 Please do not be inspired by Mallya's story, this story may force you to live
 is puure vivaad main ek sawaal kaa jawaab mil gaya he
 The question was arising as to why the CBI issued a lookout notice against Mallya and why it was changed
 pitiai ke anusaar sibiai ne jo jawaab diya he aap use gambhirtha se lijiega
 If it is not denied quickly, it can be amazing
 sibiai ne kaha he ki vijay maalya ke bare main jo pehla lukout notice jari hua tha wo galati se ho gaya tha
 Now tell
 hamaare desh main galati se lukout notice jari ho jaataa he
 In the same way, if the lookout notices are issued by mistake, then you people also keep looking at the airport, do you know if an officer comes to you by mistake, lookout notice
 ab to mujhe yah bhi lagane laga he ki vijay maalya ko prime time dekhte hi bharat aa janaa chahie
 What do all the banks like the CBI say that the debt of 7000 crores is not taken by Vijay Mallya, but by prime time anchor Ravish Kumar
 kya meraa koi darshak landan main he jo kal kaa tikat bhej saktaa he
 i am also ready to go into the economy
 aap inhen to jaanate hi honge
 If anyone has understood Vijay Mallya properly, it is Farooq Abdullah, the former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha ki vijay maalya ne desh ke liye bahut munafa kamaaya he
 Now when it comes to the country, the matter can be centi
 par ek chota sa sawaal he ki jab desh ke liye munafa kama rahe the to desh ke bainkon ko hazaron karod kaa ghaataa kaise ho gaya
 Did all those banks belong to Maldives Malta
 main to faruk sahab kii baat par bhavuk ho gaya ki maalya ne desh ke liye munafa kamaaya he
 Such a person goes abroad after so much hard work and there is a ruckus, how unfair it is
 suniye abdulla sahab ko
 i wish someone would even say to farmers that it is natural to fail in farming
 11 march ke hi din pichley saal mausam kii maar se hazaron kisaan karz main dub gaye the
 Half of the farming fails due to nature
 acha he kisaan log twitor par nahin hai, shaayad tivi bhi nahin dekhte honge
 Don't know, the channel entangles them in the ghost story and the story of the five thousand year old sword
 jo khubi faruk abdulla sahab ko vijay maalya main nazar ai wo baat sharad yadav ko nazar nahin ai
 Sharad ji will definitely be a negative person
 vaise us vakt ve vijay maalya ko lekar kaaphi positive rahe honge jab vijay ji unki party ke varisht upaadhyaksh the
 a year later, that in 2003, if Mallya had not left Janata Dal United, then there would have been a press conference in Patna
 vijay maalya ji kehete hai ki ve antarrashtriya bijnesaman hai
 They travel abroad
 saansad hone ke naate ve kanoon kaa sammaan karte hai
 Our judiciary is much better and respected
 to rahi baat sammaan kii to unke bayanon se lagata to he ki ve sammaan main koi kami nahin karte hai
 If they have problems, then through media trial
 baad main unhone ek duusare twit main sanket diya ki media unka trial karegaa to ve bhi media kaa trial kar sakate hai
 He tweets, 'media bosses should not forget that i have helped and held them for many years, whose documents are also present
 isliye tiarapy ke liye koi jhooth nahin chalegaa
 ' ab is tarah kaa twit karenge to koun unke bare main kya bolegaa
 They don't know who is teaching them all to get behind the media
 badi mushkil se to media ko peeche padane ke liye koi mila he or ye hai ki kah rahe hai ki media ke hi peeche pad jaaenge wo bhi dacument lekar
 Is it not so that Lalit Modi ji has seduced Mallya
 pichley saal lalit modi bhi isi tarah twit kar sabake peeche pad gaye the
 In the end, the same thing happened that everyone forgot Lalit Modi together
 varna unhen lekar sab ek duusare kii hi pole kholane lage the
 My message to those who are desperate to see Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya is not to worry
 jab bhi bada aadmi bane kam se kam do raajnneetik dalon kaa khyaal zarur rakhen or inase kuch batch jaae to media kaa bhi
 Keep his document and when someone questions, tweet that we will tell everyone
 pataa nahin kiskaa video or kiskaa kis avasthaa main photo nikal jaae, pataa chalaa ki unhen lekar kuch or bavaal ho gaya
 Surely everyone must be celebrating inside that if they have gone abroad, stay there
 aane kii kya zarurat he
 There is a lot of discussion of the Art of Living nowadays, but in Mallya's case, the Art of Living means the art of escape
 times of india ne shuukravaar ko report chhaapi he ki maalya sahab ne 2 march dopaher kii jet airways kii flit pakadi, firstclas main savaar hue or landan chale gaye
 The Times of India has quoted reports quoting sources that they have carried seven heavy bags with them
 ishwar se yahi prarthana he ki media ke logon vaala dastavej un saaton bag main na ho
 It will be cash clothes, but if they remove it and start tweet then it can be amazing
 indian express kii khabar ke anusaar maalya sahab landan jane se pehle 1 march ko rajyasabha gaye the
 According to the attendance record on the Rajya Sabha website, Mallya was present in the House on March 1
 kitni acchhee baat he
 He also went to Parliament to work for the country before going abroad
 phir kyon sab unke peeche pade hai mujhe samaj nahin aata jabaki maine to unki kingfisher flite se sirf wo laal vaala year phone hi liya tha
 There is a good news for those who are disappointed with Mallya going abroad
 enditivi dot com ke anusaar pravartan nideshaalay ne unhen 18 march ko mumbai bulaayaa he taaki unase mani laundry ke ek cese main poochtacha kar sake
 This week, the Enforcement Directorate has filed a money laundering case
 aarope he ki unhone idibiai bank se 900 karod kaa karz liya he or galat tareeke se videsh bhej diya he
 That is, they do not go abroad by themselves, they also send money abroad
 kab tak hamaara rupaya dollar ke mukaable kamazor hota rahegaa
 Even when i came out, i roamed around
 vijay maalya jis tarah se nyaaypalika or kanoon ke sammaan par jor de rahe hai us hisaab se 16-17 dinon ke liye videsh janaa koi badi baat to nahin he
 When he went to London on 2 March, there was no notice against him
 vitt mantri arun jetali kaa bayaan he ki jis din maalya ne desh choda us din bank ne apni kanoonee prakriya shuru nahin kii thi
 Till then, there was no order from any agency to stop them from leaving the country
 congress netaa gulam ali azaad vitt mantri jetali ke is daawey ko chunauti de rahe hai
 He says the CBI had issued a lookout notice for Vijay Mallya last November but that was changed a month later
 pehla notice ye tha ki dekhte hi giraftaar kar liya jaae
 According to Azad, it was later that only his visits be monitored
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki jisane desh kaa 9000 karod rupaya churaayaa ho use desh se kaise bhaagane diya gaya
 Finance Minister Jaitley also replied that in Congress time, thousands of crores of loans were given to Mallya
 azaad kaa kahana he ki bina sarkaar kii bhagidaari ke maalya bhaag nahin sakate

 ab aap hi bataaiye ki doshi koun he
 The first one is now the one
 bataane se pehle yaad rakhiyegaa ki maalya sahab saat baari bharkam bag lekar gaye hai
 Don't tell me that something goes out of your bag against you
 kya vaaki maalya ko baahar jane main madad di gai
 Why his look out notice was changed
 jabaki vitt mantri bhi maan rahe hai ki 30 november tak maalya ji par maatr 9 hazaar 91 karod kaa karz tha
 There is so much debt on someone, no one noticed the possibility of his escape
 ho saktaa he
 The amount is so large that everyone's attention must have been spent in counting
 vaise vitt mantri ne ek or udhaaharan se samajhane kaa prayaas kiya ki kwatroki ke bhaagane or maalya ke bhaagane main kyon fark he
 When authorities in Switzerland reported that Quattrocchi was a beneficiary of the Bofors scandal, k Madhavan wrote a letter asking that his passport be confiscated, the government did not stop him and he left the country within two days
 wo ek aapraadhik maamla tha
 This statement reveals the exploits of the Congress, but what happened in Mallya's case gives an answer
 ek puraani ghatana kaa yahaan zikr karnaa chahie
 In January 2015, Priya Pillai, a member of Greenpeace NGO, was barred from going to London

 Now tell
 hamaare desh main galati se lukout notice jari ho jaataa he
 In the same way, if the lookout notices are issued by mistake, then you people also keep looking at the airport, do you know if an officer comes to you by mistake, lookout notice
 ab to mujhe yah bhi lagane laga he ki vijay maalya ko prime time dekhte hi bharat aa janaa chahie
 What do all the banks like the CBI say that the debt of 7000 crores is not taken by Vijay Mallya, but by prime time anchor Ravish Kumar
 kya meraa koi darshak landan main he jo kal kaa tikat bhej saktaa he
 i am also ready to go into the economy
 kaash koi kisaanon ke liye bhi bolta ki kheti main fail hona janaa natural hota he
 On the same day of March 11, thousands of farmers drowned in debt due to the weather
 aadhi kheti to nechar ke kaaran hi nechurali fail ho jaati he
 It is good that the farmers are not on Twitter, they might not even watch TV
 pataa nahin channel vaale unhen bhoot pret or paanch hazaar saal puraani talwaar kii story main ulajhaa dete hon
 Sharad Yadav did not see the quality that Farooq Abdullah Sahib saw in Vijay Mallya
 sharad ji zarur negative vyakti honge
 However, he must have been very positive about Vijay Mallya when Vijay ji was the senior vice president of his party
 ek saal baad yani ki 2003 main agar maalya ne janata dal united na chodi hoti to pakkaa is maamle main patna main press conference ho rahaa hota
 Vijay Mallya says that he is an international businessman
 videsh yatraaen karte rahete hai
 As mps, they respect the law
 hamaari nyaaypalika bahut behatar he or sammaan karte hai
 If you talk about respect, then it seems from their statements that they do not lose any respect
 unhen dikkat he to media trial se
 Later, in a second tweet, he indicated that if the media trials him, he can also trial the media

 The Times of India reported on Friday that Mallya Saheb caught a flight of Jet Airways on 2 March afternoon, boarded firstclass and flew to London

 According to the news of the Indian Express, Mallya Saheb went to Rajya Sabha on 1 March before leaving for London

 According to ndtv

 How long our rupee will continue to weaken against the dollar

 According to the way Vijay Mallya is insisting on respecting the judiciary and the law, going abroad for 16-17 days is not a big deal
 2 march ko jab ve landan gaye to unke kilaaf kisi prakaar kaa notice nahin tha
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's statement that the bank did not start its legal process on the day Mallya left the country
 tab us vakt tak kisi bhi angesi kii taraf se koi bhi aadesh nahin tha ki unhen desh chhodane se roka jaae
 Congress leader Ghulam Ali Azad is challenging this claim by Finance Minister Jaitley
 unka kahana he ki pichley november main sibiai ne vijay maalya ke liye lukout notice jari kiya tha lekin uske ek maheene baad hi badal diya gaya
 The first notice was that he should be arrested on sight
 azaad ke anusaar baad main yah kar diya gaya ki sirf unke dauron par nazar rakhi jaae
 Rahul Gandhi said how he who stole 9000 crores of the country was allowed to flee the country
 vitt mantri jetali ne bhi jawaab diya ki congress ke time main hi to maalya ko hazaron karod ke lone diye gaye
 Azad says that Mallya cannot run without government involvement
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki vipaksh vaale jab sarkaar main the bina unki madad ke maalya ko lone nahin mil saktaa
 Now tell me who is guilty
 pehle vaala ki ab vaala
 Before telling, remember that Mallya sahib has carried seven heavy bags
 itnaa mat bataa dijiega ki unke bag se aapke hi khilaaf kuch nikal jaae
 Is Mallya really helped to go out? unke luk out notice ko kyon badla gaya
 While the Finance Minister also believes that till November 30, Mallya ji had a loan of only 9 thousand 91 crores
 kisi par itnaa karz ho, uske bhaagane kii sambhaavna par kisi kaa dhyaan hi nahin aayaa
 It is possible

 However, the Finance Minister tried to explain with another example why there is a difference between Quattrocchi's escape and Mallya's escape
 jab sweetsraland ke adhikariyon ne bataaya ki kwatroki boforce ghotaale kaa ek labhaarthi he, ke madhavan ne ek khat likhaa he ki uskaa passport zabt kar liya jaae, tab sarkaar ne use nahin roka or do din ke andar hi usne desh chhod diya

 An old incident should be mentioned here

 She was not running away but was going to London to raise her voice for the tribals

 Three months later, in March 2015, the Delhi High Court ruled on Priya Pillai that as per the policy of the government, to speak or for the right of someone ladane ke adhikaar ko samaapt nahin kar sakate
 Therefore, the off load remark should be removed from Priya Pillai's passport
 desh se baahar na jane dene kii suchi se unka naam hataaya jaae
 Pillai said, 'I was told at the airport that you cannot go out of the country

 In August 2014, Vijay Mallya appears in a special court in Bangalore
 unke kilaaf iskar vibhaag ne teen mukademen daayar kiye the
 The case in Bangalore is that Vijay Mallya did not pay tax of Rs 400 crore to the government

 The court ordered that they cooperate in the trial

 The High Court said that if you were not happy with the lower court's decision to grant bail then why did you wait till August 2015
 aaj tak unke khilaaf lukout notice kyon nahin jari hue hai jinhen aap sunwaayee ke liye bulaanaa chaahate hai
 Moreover, the department also had to listen to the fact that its papers were not complete
 maamla yah tha ki maalya kii company kingfisher airlines ne 32 karod kaa sarvice tex upabhoktaaon se vasuul kar sarkaar ko nahin diya tha
 The service tax department said that Mallya's passport should be confiscated but the court said that you are unable to prove that Mallya is a habitual criminal

 He started talking but did not give any formal reply

 The asset under oath is that you should write to the court that you have this property and that we have this property and i will give my loan out of it

 Therefore, the concept of asset under oath is applied to them

 However, various statements are coming about Mallya saheb
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ke bayaan ke ek shabd se sahamat to nahin hum kyonki unhone vijay ji ko safed collar aatankwaadi kah diya he
 Yet Uddhav felt fearlessly about Thackeray that Vijay Mallya would have absolutely no proof about him

 BJP spokesperson Shrikant Sharma has said that Congress has allowed Vijay Mallya to be looted heavily during his tenure
 iskaa matlab he ki bijepi bhi maanati he ki maalya ne lutaa he
 So in the coming days, the BJP will test this, that it is not going to leave Mallya at all
 congress ke manish tiwari ne poocha he ki vijay maalya ko rajyasabha kaa sadsy banane main kis bijepi ke vidhayak ne vot kiya tha
 Whenever the two parties open each other's expectation, the expectation is that now everything will come out

 If you have taken a bank loan and are unable to repay it then there is a constitutional warning for you

 One question has been answered in this entire controversy
 sawaal uth rahaa tha ki maalya ke khilaaf sibiai ne lukout notice kyon jari kiya or use kyon badla gaya
 According to PTI, you will take seriously the answer given by CBI
 agar iskaa jaldi khandan nahin kiya gaya to gazab ho saktaa he
 The CBI has said that the first lookout notice issued about Vijay Mallya was in error
 ab bataaiye
 Lookout notice is issued by mistake in our country
 agar isi tarah galati se lukout notice jari hote rahe to aap log bhi airport par lukout karte rahiye, kya pataa koi afasar aapke khilaaf galati se lukout notice lekar aa jaae
 Now i have also started feeling that Vijay Mallya should come to India as soon as he sees prime time
 kya pataa sibiai kii tarah saare bank ye kah den ki 7000 karod kaa karz vijay maalya ne nahin, prime time ke ankar raveesh kumaar ne liya he
 Do i have an audience in London that can send a ticket tomorrow? main to iconomi main bhi jane ke liye taiyaar hum
 Vijay Mallya says that he is an international businessman
 videsh yatraaen karte rahete hai
 As mps, they respect the law
 hamaari nyaaypalika bahut behatar he or sammaan karte hai
 If you talk about respect, then it seems from their statements that they do not lose any respect
 unhen dikkat he to media trial se
 Later, in a second tweet, he indicated that if the media trials him, he can also trial the media
 wo twit karte hai, 'media ke bos logon ko nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki maine unhen kai varshon tak madad kii he, tehraaya he, jiske sabhi dastauez bhi maujuud hai

 The CBI has said that the first lookout notice issued about Vijay Mallya was in error
 ab bataaiye
 Lookout notice is issued by mistake in our country
 agar isi tarah galati se lukout notice jari hote rahe to aap log bhi airport par lukout karte rahiye, kya pataa koi afasar aapke khilaaf galati se lukout notice lekar aa jaae
 Now i have also started feeling that Vijay Mallya should come to India as soon as he sees prime time
 kya pataa sibiai kii tarah saare bank ye kah den ki 7000 karod kaa karz vijay maalya ne nahin, prime time ke ankar raveesh kumaar ne liya he
 Do i have an audience in London that can send a ticket tomorrow? main to iconomi main bhi jane ke liye taiyaar hum
 Now if we tweet like this, then who will speak about them? pataa nahin unhen ye sab koun sikhaa rahaa he ki media ke peeche hi pad jaao
 With great difficulty, the media has found someone to fall behind and they are saying that they will fall behind the media only with the document
 kahin aisa to nahin ki maalya ko lalit modi ji ne bahaka diya he
 Last year, Lalit Modi too fell behind by tweeting in a similar manner
 ant main vahi hua ki lalit modi ko sabane milakar bhula diya
 Otherwise, everyone was starting to open each other's pole with them
 lalit modi or vijay maalya ko dekhakar hataash hone waalon ko meraa yahi sandesh he ki chintaa na karen
 Whenever you become a big man, take care of at least two political parties and if something is left of them, then the media too
 uskaa dacument rakhen or jab koi sawaal kare to twit kar den ki sabko bataa denge
 i do not know whose video and in whose stage the photo comes out, it is known that something else has happened with them
 zarur sab bheetar hi bheetar manaa rahe honge ki videsh gaye hai to vahiin rahen
 Why do you have to come? aaj kal art of living kii bahut charchaa ho rahi he, lekin maalya maamle main art of living yani bhaagane kii kala par charchaa hone lagi he
 The Times of India reported on Friday that Mallya Saheb caught a flight of Jet Airways on 2 March afternoon, boarded firstclass and flew to London
 times of india ne sutron ke hawaale se khabar chhaapi he ki ve apane saath saat baari bharkam bag lekar gaye hai
 It is a request to God that the document containing media persons should not be in those seven bags
 cash kapade hon ye to chalegaa lekin agar vahaan se ve nikaal kar twit karne lage to gazab ho saktaa he
 According to the news of the Indian Express, Mallya Saheb went to Rajya Sabha on 1 March before leaving for London
 rajyasabha kii website par haaziri kaa jo record he uske anusaar maalya ji ek march ko sadan main maujuud the
 What a good thing videsh jane se pehle ve desh kaa kaam karne sansad bhi gaye the
 Then i do not understand why everyone is behind them even though i had only taken that red year phone from their Kingfisher flight
 jo log maalya ji ke videsh chale jane se niraash hai unke liye ek acchhee khabar he
 According to ndtv
com, the Enforcement Directorate has called him to Mumbai on March 18 to interrogate him in a money laundering case
 isi hafte pravartan nideshaalay ne mani laundry kaa cese darj kiya he
 It is alleged that he has taken a loan of 900 crores from IDBI Bank and wrongly sent it abroad
 yani ki ve khud hi videsh nahin jate, paise ko bhi videsh bhejte hai
 How long our rupee will continue to weaken against the dollar
 zaraa baahar bhi to gum phir kar aae
 According to the way Vijay Mallya is insisting on respecting the judiciary and the law, going abroad for 16-17 days is not a big deal
 2 march ko jab ve landan gaye to unke kilaaf kisi prakaar kaa notice nahin tha
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's statement that the bank did not start its legal process on the day Mallya left the country
 tab us vakt tak kisi bhi angesi kii taraf se koi bhi aadesh nahin tha ki unhen desh chhodane se roka jaae
 Congress leader Ghulam Ali Azad is challenging this claim by Finance Minister Jaitley
 unka kahana he ki pichley november main sibiai ne vijay maalya ke liye lukout notice jari kiya tha lekin uske ek maheene baad hi badal diya gaya
 The first notice was that he should be arrested on sight
 azaad ke anusaar baad main yah kar diya gaya ki sirf unke dauron par nazar rakhi jaae
 Rahul Gandhi said how he who stole 9000 crores of the country was allowed to flee the country
 vitt mantri jetali ne bhi jawaab diya ki congress ke time main hi to maalya ko hazaron karod ke lone diye gaye
 Azad says that Mallya cannot run without government involvement
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki vipaksh vaale jab sarkaar main the bina unki madad ke maalya ko lone nahin mil saktaa
 Now tell me who is guilty
 pehle vaala ki ab vaala
 Before telling, remember that Mallya sahib has carried seven heavy bags
 itnaa mat bataa dijiega ki unke bag se aapke hi khilaaf kuch nikal jaae
 Is Mallya really helped to go out? unke luk out notice ko kyon badla gaya
 While the Finance Minister also believes that till November 30, Mallya ji had a loan of only 9 thousand 91 crores
 kisi par itnaa karz ho, uske bhaagane kii sambhaavna par kisi kaa dhyaan hi nahin aayaa
 It is possible
 rakam itani badi he ki sabakaa dhyaan ginaney main laga rah gaya hoga
 However, the Finance Minister tried to explain with another example why there is a difference between Quattrocchi's escape and Mallya's escape
 jab sweetsraland ke adhikariyon ne bataaya ki kwatroki boforce ghotaale kaa ek labhaarthi he, ke madhavan ne ek khat likhaa he ki uskaa passport zabt kar liya jaae, tab sarkaar ne use nahin roka or do din ke andar hi usne desh chhod diya
 It was a criminal case
 is bayaan se congress ke karname kaa pataa to chalata he lekin maalya ji ke maamle main jo hua kya uskaa jawaab miltaa he
 An old incident should be mentioned here
 janvari 2015 main greenpis enjio kii sadsy priya pillai ko landan jane se roak diya gaya
 She was not running away but was going to London to raise her voice for the tribals
 hawaii adde par bataaya jaataa he ki ibi kaa unke khilaaf lukout notice he
 Three months later, in March 2015, the Delhi High Court ruled on Priya Pillai that as per the policy of the government, to speak or for the right of someone ladane ke adhikaar ko samaapt nahin kar sakate
 Therefore, the off load remark should be removed from Priya Pillai's passport
 desh se baahar na jane dene kii suchi se unka naam hataaya jaae
 Pillai said, 'I was told at the airport that you cannot go out of the country
 mere paas saare dastauez the
 There was no investigation against me
 koi cese nahin tha
 Still i was stopped
 ye to hairaani vaali baat thi
 There was also no lookout notice issued against me
 ' But was there no ongoing case against Vijay Mallya? chand udaahranon se pataa chalata he ki ve kaaphi lambey samay se adaalaton ke chakkar laga rahe hai yaa kahiye ki kai vibhaag unase vasuulne ke chakkar main adaalaton ke chakkar laga rahe hai
 In August 2014, Vijay Mallya appears in a special court in Bangalore
 unke kilaaf iskar vibhaag ne teen mukademen daayar kiye the
 The case in Bangalore is that Vijay Mallya did not pay tax of Rs 400 crore to the government
 maalya sahab ko ek ek lakh rupee ke muchalke par zamaanat de di gai
 The court ordered that they cooperate in the trial
 iskar vibhaag ne daleel di thi ki maalya karrwai kaarywahi main madad nahin kar paayenge ki ve non racident indian (enarai) hai
 Keep coming out
 isliye ho saktaa he ki wo trial main sahyog na karen
 He is also an effective businessman and has considerable influence in the corridors of power
 unke kilaaf ek or maamla mumbai kii ek adaalat main chal rahaa tha
 It was alleged that Mallya Saheb has not given the service tax money taken from the consumers to the government
 is maamle main unhen mumbai kii nichali adaalat se farvari 2015 main zamaanat mil gai thi
 The service tax department challenged the decision in August 2015 in the Bobbe High Court
 11 march yani aaj bambe hoicourt main isi maamle main sunwaayee hui to sarvice tex vibhaag ko kaaphi kuch sunanaa padaa
 The High Court said that if you were not happy with the lower court's decision to grant bail then why did you wait till August 2015
 aaj tak unke khilaaf lukout notice kyon nahin jari hue hai jinhen aap sunwaayee ke liye bulaanaa chaahate hai
 Moreover, the department also had to listen to the fact that its papers were not complete
 maamla yah tha ki maalya kii company kingfisher airlines ne 32 karod kaa sarvice tex upabhoktaaon se vasuul kar sarkaar ko nahin diya tha
 The service tax department said that Mallya's passport should be confiscated but the court said that you are unable to prove that Mallya is a habitual criminal
 duusari baat ye he ki maalya ne likhit rup main diya he ki ve harek sunwaayee par maujuud rahenge to phir ye maamla nahin banataa he ki passport zabt kar liya jaae
 Vijay Mallya has repeatedly said that he respects the court and helps in legal action, but the incident seems to have broken the initial confidence of the court
 iskar vibhaag or sarvice tex vibhaag donon ko ashanka thi ki enarai hone ke naate maalya desh chhod sakate hai or yah bhi sanket miltaa he ki in vibhaagon ne maalya ko rokane ke liye thos prayaas nahin kiye
 In the case of big people, such small mistakes occur
 khaas baat he ki aisi galatiyaan har sarkaar main ho jaati hai
 Journalist Shekhar Gupta has spoken to Arundhati Bhattacharya, the head of the State Bank of India
 unki baat se aapako yakeen ho jayega ki maalya ke kilaaf vijay praapt karnaa itnaa aasaan nahin he
 It is known from these three examples that departmental action was going on against Vijay Mallya
 media main aar bi ai ke chif raghuram rajan kaa bayaan bhi aa rahaa tha ki maalya jaise logon ko shahi kharch nahin karnaa chahie, isse logon main galat massej jaataa he
 Apart from the political parties, in which account will you show the kindness of all the departments
 unke saat bag main se kisi ek bag main yaa kisi or jhole main
 State Bank of India is searching for Mallya ji to recover his 1500 crores
 tamaam bank apana apana paisa vasuulana chaahate hai
 Mallya has said in his statement that they are trying to resolve the matter by talking to banks but Arundhati Bhattacharya, head of State Bank of India, told Shekhar Gupta something else
 vijay maalya ko hamane van time setlement ke liye ofer diya tha
 He started talking but did not give any formal reply
 isliye ham court ko baar-baar kah rahe the ki asset under oth hamen den
 The asset under oath is that you should write to the court that you have this property and that we have this property and i will give my loan out of it
 jab hamane kingfisher airlines ko doosraa chance diya tab unhone apni personal guarantee di thi
 Therefore, the concept of asset under oath is applied to them
 main yahi kahana chaahati hum ki ham ek hi team hai
 We should all work together
 2012 main kingfisher airlines ghate se guzar rahi thi tab upie sarkaar isaki madad karnaa chaahati thi
 Which was opposed by BJP
 uske chalate upie ke mantriyon ne bayaan diye ki sarkaar kingfisher ko bachaane kaa prayaas nahin kar rahi he
 a few months later Kingfisher got a loan of 1500 crore from State Bank of India
 is puure maamle main bainkon ke bheetar maalya ke haq main faisle lene vaale adhikariyon yaa nideshak kii koi baat hi nahin ho rahi he
 Would they have been completely innocent? ab sawaal he ki saat hazaar karod ke karz ko chukaane ke liye vijay maalya ke paas sampatti he yaa nahin
 Take care of one thing
 sara maamla adaalat main he
 It will be decided by the court that how much liability is incurred on them
 kitna chukaayenge or kitni sazaa hogi
 Nevertheless, it should become a fat thing that how much they have
 faruk abdulla kehete hai ki maalya desh ke liye munafa kamaaya he
 Now you also listen to Arundhati ji of State Bank of India
 wo kis desh ke liye apane bank kaa ghaataa vasuulne ke liye itani ladaai lard rahi hai
 However, various statements are coming about Mallya saheb
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ke bayaan ke ek shabd se sahamat to nahin hum kyonki unhone vijay ji ko safed collar aatankwaadi kah diya he
 Yet Uddhav felt fearlessly about Thackeray that Vijay Mallya would have absolutely no proof about him
 lalit modi ke bhaag jane ke baad jo chilla rahe the, unhen maalya kaise bhaag gaya iskaa jawaab dena hi hoga
 The government is pleading with Pakistan to bring Dawood
 lekin uski nazaron ke saamne white collar aatankwaadi bhaag chukaa he
 Mallya will run away, this child's milk-drinking child is also telling
 lekin sarkaar ko samaj main na aayaa ki achrazbhari baat he
 The alcohol intoxication at Mallya's parties is still running in many veins
 uske utarane ke baad hi baat hogi
 BJP spokesperson Shrikant Sharma has said that Congress has allowed Vijay Mallya to be looted heavily during his tenure
 iskaa matlab he ki bijepi bhi maanati he ki maalya ne lutaa he
 So in the coming days, the BJP will test this, that it is not going to leave Mallya at all
 congress ke manish tiwari ne poocha he ki vijay maalya ko rajyasabha kaa sadsy banane main kis bijepi ke vidhayak ne vot kiya tha
 Whenever the two parties open each other's expectation, the expectation is that now everything will come out
 magar tabhi pardaa girtaa he or doosraa masalaa aa jaataa he
 Hopefully, Vijay Mallya's case will not be as cold as Lalit Modi's
 vaise bhi pravartan nideshaalay ke faisle par amal hua to maalya 18 march ko bharat aa sakate hai
 The comments vijay maalya jaise bade log agar bachaaye nahin gaye to chote logon kaa bada banane main yakeen chalaa jayega
 This can hurt the growth rate of our economy and create fear among foreign investors
 kya vijay maalya kii sampatti zabt kar bank apana paisa vasuul sakenge yah is baat par nirbhar karegi ki media kitni jaldi vijay maalya ke masale ko bhula detaa he jaise lalit modi ke maamle main hua
 If you have taken a bank loan and are unable to repay it then there is a constitutional warning for you
 kripaya karke maalya kii kahani se prerit na hon, ye kahani aapako jeene ke liye majaboor kar sakati he
 One question has been answered in this entire controversy
 sawaal uth rahaa tha ki maalya ke khilaaf sibiai ne lukout notice kyon jari kiya or use kyon badla gaya
 According to PTI, you will take seriously the answer given by CBI

 This week, the Enforcement Directorate has filed a money laundering case
 aarope he ki unhone idibiai bank se 900 karod kaa karz liya he or galat tareeke se videsh bhej diya he
 That is, they do not go abroad by themselves, they also send money abroad
 kab tak hamaara rupaya dollar ke mukaable kamazor hota rahegaa
 Even when i came out, i roamed around
 vijay maalya jis tarah se nyaaypalika or kanoon ke sammaan par jor de rahe hai us hisaab se 16-17 dinon ke liye videsh janaa koi badi baat to nahin he
 When he went to London on 2 March, there was no notice against him
 vitt mantri arun jetali kaa bayaan he ki jis din maalya ne desh choda us din bank ne apni kanoonee prakriya shuru nahin kii thi
 Till then, there was no order from any agency to stop them from leaving the country
 congress netaa gulam ali azaad vitt mantri jetali ke is daawey ko chunauti de rahe hai
 He says the CBI had issued a lookout notice for Vijay Mallya last November but that was changed a month later
 pehla notice ye tha ki dekhte hi giraftaar kar liya jaae
 According to Azad, it was later that only his visits be monitored
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki jisane desh kaa 9000 karod rupaya churaayaa ho use desh se kaise bhaagane diya gaya
 Finance Minister Jaitley also replied that in Congress time, thousands of crores of loans were given to Mallya
 azaad kaa kahana he ki bina sarkaar kii bhagidaari ke maalya bhaag nahin sakate
 The government says that Mallya cannot get a loan without his help when the opposition was in government
 ab aap hi bataaiye ki doshi koun he
 The first one is now the one
 bataane se pehle yaad rakhiyegaa ki maalya sahab saat baari bharkam bag lekar gaye hai
 Don't tell me that something goes out of your bag against you
 kya vaaki maalya ko baahar jane main madad di gai
 Why his look out notice was changed
 jabaki vitt mantri bhi maan rahe hai ki 30 november tak maalya ji par maatr 9 hazaar 91 karod kaa karz tha
 There is so much debt on someone, no one noticed the possibility of his escape
 ho saktaa he
 The amount is so large that everyone's attention must have been spent in counting
 vaise vitt mantri ne ek or udhaaharan se samajhane kaa prayaas kiya ki kwatroki ke bhaagane or maalya ke bhaagane main kyon fark he
 When authorities in Switzerland reported that Quattrocchi was a beneficiary of the Bofors scandal, k Madhavan wrote a letter asking that his passport be confiscated, the government did not stop him and he left the country within two days
 wo ek aapraadhik maamla tha
 This statement reveals the exploits of the Congress, but what happened in Mallya's case gives an answer
 ek puraani ghatana kaa yahaan zikr karnaa chahie
 In January 2015, Priya Pillai, a member of Greenpeace NGO, was barred from going to London
 ve bhaag kar nahin ja rahi thim balki adivaasiyon ke haq main awaz uthaane landan ja rahi thim
 The IB is said to have a lookout notice against him
 teen maheene baad march 2015 main dilli hai court ne priya pillai ke bare main faisla sunaaya ki sarkaar kii niti ke anusaar kisi ke bolne yaa kisi ke haq ke liye Cannot abolish the right to fight
 isliye priya pillai ke passport se of lod remark ko hataaya jaae
 His name should be removed from the list of not being allowed out of the country
 pillai ne bataaya, 'mujhe airport par bataaya gaya ki aap desh se baahar nahin ja sakati hai
 i had all the documents
 mere khilaaf jaanch nahin thi
 There was no case
 phir bhi mujhe roka gaya
 It was a surprise mere khilaaf koi lukout notice bhi jari nahin tha
 ' par kya vijay maalya ke khilaaf koi maamla bhi nahin chal rahaa tha
 a few examples show that they have been circling the courts for a long time or that many departments have been circling the courts to recover from them
 agast 2014 main vijay maalya bangaloru kii ek vishesh adaalat main pesh hote hai
 The Income Tax Department had filed three cases against him
 bangaloru vaala maamla yah he ki vijay maalya ne 400 karod rupee kaa tex sarkaar ko nahin diya tha
 Mallya sahib was granted bail on a bond of one lakh rupees
 adaalat ne aadesh diya ki ve trial main sahyog karenge
 The Income Tax Department had argued that Mallya would not be able to help in the proceedings that he was a non-resident Indian (NRI)
 baahar aate jate rahete hai
 So they may not cooperate in the trial
 ve ek prabhavi bijnesaman bhi hai or satta ke galiyaaron main unka kaaphi rasookh hai
 Another case against him was going on in a court in Mumbai
 aarope tha ki maalya sahab ne upabhoktaaon se liya gaya sarvice tex kaa paisa sarkaar ko nahin diya he
 In this case, he was granted bail by the trial court of Mumbai in February 2015
 sarvice tex vibhaag ne is faisle ko agast 2015 main bobe hoicourt main chunauti di
 On March 11, ie, the Bombay High Court today heard in this case, the service tax department had to hear a lot
 hai court ne kaha ki agar aap nichali adaalat ke zamaanat dene ke faisle se khush nahin the to aapane agast 2015 tak intazaar kyon kiya
 Why have not the lookout notices been issued against them till date, which you want to call for hearing
 or to or vibhaag ko is baat ke liye bhi sunanaa padaa ki uske kaagazat puure nahin he
 The case was that Mallya's company Kingfisher Airlines had not paid 32 crore service tax to the government after recovering from consumers
 sarvice tex vibhaag kaa kahana tha ki maalya kaa passport zabt kar liya jaae lekin court ne kaha tha ki aap ye baat sabit nahin kar paa rahe hai ki maalya adatan apradhi hai
 The second thing is that Mallya has given in writing that if he is present on every hearing, then it does not become a matter that the passport be confiscated
 vijay maalya ne baar baar kaha he ki ve adaalat kaa sammaan karte hai or kanoonee karrwai main madad karte hai, lekin is ghatana se lagata he ki unhone adaalat ke shuruaati bharose ko bhi todaa he
 Both the Income Tax Department and the Service Tax Department feared that Mallya could leave the country as an NRI and it also indicated that these departments did not make concerted efforts to stop Mallya
 bade logon ke maamle main is tarah kii choti galatiyaan ho jaati hai
 The special thing is that such mistakes happen in every government
 patrkaar shekhar gupta ne chalate chalate main state bank of india kii pramukh arundhati bhattacharya se baat kii he
 You will be convinced with his talk that it is not so easy to get victory against Mallya
 in teen udaahranon se gyaat hota he ki vijay maalya ke kilaaf vibhageeya karrwai chal rahi thi
 RBI Chief Raghuram Rajan's statement was also coming in the media that people like Mallya should not spend royalty, this leads to wrong messages among people
 raajnneetik dalon ke alaava tamaam vibhaagon kii meharbaaniyon ko aap kis khate main daalenge
 In one of their seven bags, or in another bag
 bhartiya state bank apane 1500 karod kii vasuuli ke liye maalya ji ko khoj rahaa he
 All banks want to recover their own money
 maalya ne apane bayaan main kaha he ki ve bainkon se baat kar maamla sulajhane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai lekin state bank of india kii pramukh arundhati bhattacharya ne shekhar gupta se kuch or kaha
 We had offered Vijay Mallya for one time settlement
 unhone baat to shuru to kii lekin koi aupchaarik jawaab nahin diya
 That is why we were repeatedly telling the court to give us the asset under Oath
 asset under oth ye he ki aapke paas jitani sampatti he aap court ko likhakar den ki hamaare paas ye sampatti he or main isamen se apana lone de duungaa
 When we gave another chance to Kingfisher Airlines, they gave their personal guarantee
 isliye un par asset under oth kaa concept lagu hota he
 i want to say that we are the same team
 ham sabko milakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Kingfisher Airlines was going through a loss in 2012 when the UPA government wanted to help it
 jiskaa bijepi ne virodh kiya tha
 Due to this, the UPA ministers gave a statement that the government is not trying to save Kingfisher
 kuch hi maheenon baad kingfisher ko bhartiya state bank se 1500 karod kaa lone mil gaya
 In this whole matter, there is no talk of officers or directors taking decisions within the banks in favor of Mallya
 kya ve puri tarah nirdosh rahe honge
 Now the question is whether Vijay Mallya has the property to repay the debt of seven thousand crores
 ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhiyegaa
 The whole matter is in court
 adaalat se hi tay hoga ki un par kitni dendaree banati he
 How much will you pay and how much will be the punishment
 phir bhi ek motaa moti baat ho jaani chahie ki unke paas apana kitna he
 Farooq Abdullah says that Mallya has made a profit for the country
 ab aap state bank of india kii arundhati ji kii bhi suniye
 For which country is she fighting so much to recover her bank losses
 baharhaal maalya sahab ko lekar tarah tarah ke bayaan aa rahe hai
 i do not agree with one word of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray's statement as he has called Vijay ji a white collar terrorist
 phir bhi uddhav thakare kii nirbhikta se laga ki unke bare main to vijay maalya ke paas pakkaa koi saboot nahin hoga
 Those who were screaming after Lalit Modi ran away will have to answer how Mallya ran
 daaud ko laane ke liye sarkaar pakistan ke saamne yachana kar rahi he
 But the white collar terrorist has fled in front of his eyes
 maalya bhaag jayega yah desh kaa doodh peetaa baccha bhi bataa rahaa he
 But the government did not understand that this was a surprise
 maalya kii partiyon main parosi sharaab kaa nasha ab bhi kaiyon ke ragon main daud rahaa he
 It will be only after his landing
 bijepi pravaktaa shrikant sharma ne kaha he ki congress ne apane kaarykaal main vijay maalya ko jamkar luutane kii chhot di he
 This means that BJP also believes that Mallya has looted
 to aane vaale dinon main bijepi ye imtahaan degi ko wo maalya ko bilkul nahin chhodane vaali he
 Manish Tiwari of the Congress has asked which BJP MLA voted to make Vijay Mallya a member of Rajya Sabha
 jab bhi donon partiyaan ek duusare kii pole kholti hai ummid bad jaati he ki ab sab baahar aa jayega
 But then the curtain falls and another issue arises
 ummid he vijay maalya kaa maamla lalit modi kii tarah thanda nahin padegaa
 Anyway, if the decision of the Enforcement Directorate is implemented, Mallya can come to India on 18 March
 tippaniyan If big people like Vijay Mallya are not saved, then small people will believe in becoming big
 isse hamaari arthvyavastha ke growth rate ko nuksaan pahunch saktaa he or videshi niveshkon main dar paidaa ho saktaa he
 Whether banks will be able to recover their money by seizing Vijay Mallya's assets will depend on how soon the media forgets Vijay Mallya's issue like it did in the case of Lalit Modi
 agar aapane bank kaa lone liya he or chukaa nahin paa rahe hai to aapke liye ek sanvaidhanik chetavanee he
 Please do not be inspired by Mallya's story, this story may force you to live
 is puure vivaad main ek sawaal kaa jawaab mil gaya he
 The question was arising as to why the CBI issued a lookout notice against Mallya and why it was changed
 pitiai ke anusaar sibiai ne jo jawaab diya he aap use gambhirtha se lijiega
 If it is not denied quickly, it can be amazing
 sibiai ne kaha he ki vijay maalya ke bare main jo pehla lukout notice jari hua tha wo galati se ho gaya tha
 Now tell
 hamaare desh main galati se lukout notice jari ho jaataa he
 In the same way, if the lookout notices are issued by mistake, then you people also keep looking at the airport, do you know if an officer comes to you by mistake, lookout notice
 ab to mujhe yah bhi lagane laga he ki vijay maalya ko prime time dekhte hi bharat aa janaa chahie
 What do all the banks like the CBI say that the debt of 7000 crores is not taken by Vijay Mallya, but by prime time anchor Ravish Kumar
 kya meraa koi darshak landan main he jo kal kaa tikat bhej saktaa he
 i am also ready to go into the economy
 congress netaa gulam ali azaad vitt mantri jetali ke is daawey ko chunauti de rahe hai
 He says the CBI had issued a lookout notice for Vijay Mallya last November but that was changed a month later

 RBI Chief Raghuram Rajan's statement was also coming in the media that people like Mallya should not spend royalty, this leads to wrong messages among people
 raajnneetik dalon ke alaava tamaam vibhaagon kii meharbaaniyon ko aap kis khate main daalenge
 In one of their seven bags, or in another bag
 bhartiya state bank apane 1500 karod kii vasuuli ke liye maalya ji ko khoj rahaa he
 All banks want to recover their own money
 maalya ne apane bayaan main kaha he ki ve bainkon se baat kar maamla sulajhane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai lekin state bank of india kii pramukh arundhati bhattacharya ne shekhar gupta se kuch or kaha
 We had offered Vijay Mallya for one time settlement
 unhone baat to shuru to kii lekin koi aupchaarik jawaab nahin diya
 That is why we were repeatedly telling the court to give us the asset under Oath
 asset under oth ye he ki aapke paas jitani sampatti he aap court ko likhakar den ki hamaare paas ye sampatti he or main isamen se apana lone de duungaa
 When we gave another chance to Kingfisher Airlines, they gave their personal guarantee
 isliye un par asset under oth kaa concept lagu hota he
 i want to say that we are the same team
 ham sabko milakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Kingfisher Airlines was going through a loss in 2012 when the UPA government wanted to help it
 jiskaa bijepi ne virodh kiya tha
 Due to this, the UPA ministers gave a statement that the government is not trying to save Kingfisher
 kuch hi maheenon baad kingfisher ko bhartiya state bank se 1500 karod kaa lone mil gaya
 In this whole matter, there is no talk of officers or directors taking decisions within the banks in favor of Mallya
 kya ve puri tarah nirdosh rahe honge
 Now the question is whether Vijay Mallya has the property to repay the debt of seven thousand crores
 ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhiyegaa
 The whole matter is in court
 adaalat se hi tay hoga ki un par kitni dendaree banati he
 How much will you pay and how much will be the punishment
 phir bhi ek motaa moti baat ho jaani chahie ki unke paas apana kitna he
 Farooq Abdullah says that Mallya has made a profit for the country
 ab aap state bank of india kii arundhati ji kii bhi suniye
 For which country is she fighting so much to recover her bank losses
 baharhaal maalya sahab ko lekar tarah tarah ke bayaan aa rahe hai
 i do not agree with one word of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray's statement as he has called Vijay ji a white collar terrorist
 phir bhi uddhav thakare kii nirbhikta se laga ki unke bare main to vijay maalya ke paas pakkaa koi saboot nahin hoga
 Those who were screaming after Lalit Modi ran away will have to answer how Mallya ran
 daaud ko laane ke liye sarkaar pakistan ke saamne yachana kar rahi he
 But the white collar terrorist has fled in front of his eyes
 maalya bhaag jayega yah desh kaa doodh peetaa baccha bhi bataa rahaa he
 But the government did not understand that this was a surprise
 maalya kii partiyon main parosi sharaab kaa nasha ab bhi kaiyon ke ragon main daud rahaa he
 It will be only after his landing
 bijepi pravaktaa shrikant sharma ne kaha he ki congress ne apane kaarykaal main vijay maalya ko jamkar luutane kii chhot di he
 This means that BJP also believes that Mallya has looted
 to aane vaale dinon main bijepi ye imtahaan degi ko wo maalya ko bilkul nahin chhodane vaali he
 Manish Tiwari of the Congress has asked which BJP MLA voted to make Vijay Mallya a member of Rajya Sabha
 jab bhi donon partiyaan ek duusare kii pole kholti hai ummid bad jaati he ki ab sab baahar aa jayega
 But then the curtain falls and another issue arises
 ummid he vijay maalya kaa maamla lalit modi kii tarah thanda nahin padegaa
 Anyway, if the decision of the Enforcement Directorate is implemented, Mallya can come to India on 18 March
 tippaniyan If big people like Vijay Mallya are not saved, then small people will believe in becoming big
 isse hamaari arthvyavastha ke growth rate ko nuksaan pahunch saktaa he or videshi niveshkon main dar paidaa ho saktaa he
 Whether banks will be able to recover their money by seizing Vijay Mallya's assets will depend on how soon the media forgets Vijay Mallya's issue like it did in the case of Lalit Modi
 agar aapane bank kaa lone liya he or chukaa nahin paa rahe hai to aapke liye ek sanvaidhanik chetavanee he
 Please do not be inspired by Mallya's story, this story may force you to live
 is puure vivaad main ek sawaal kaa jawaab mil gaya he
 The question was arising as to why the CBI issued a lookout notice against Mallya and why it was changed
 pitiai ke anusaar sibiai ne jo jawaab diya he aap use gambhirtha se lijiega
 If it is not denied quickly, it can be amazing
 sibiai ne kaha he ki vijay maalya ke bare main jo pehla lukout notice jari hua tha wo galati se ho gaya tha
 Now tell
 hamaare desh main galati se lukout notice jari ho jaataa he
 In the same way, if the lookout notices are issued by mistake, then you people also keep looking at the airport, do you know if an officer comes to you by mistake, lookout notice
 ab to mujhe yah bhi lagane laga he ki vijay maalya ko prime time dekhte hi bharat aa janaa chahie
 What do all the banks like the CBI say that the debt of 7000 crores is not taken by Vijay Mallya, but by prime time anchor Ravish Kumar
 kya meraa koi darshak landan main he jo kal kaa tikat bhej saktaa he
 i am also ready to go into the economy
 azaad kaa kahana he ki bina sarkaar kii bhagidaari ke maalya bhaag nahin sakate
 The government says that Mallya cannot get a loan without his help when the opposition was in government
 ab aap hi bataaiye ki doshi koun he
 The first one is now the one
 bataane se pehle yaad rakhiyegaa ki maalya sahab saat baari bharkam bag lekar gaye hai
 Don't tell me that something goes out of your bag against you
 kya vaaki maalya ko baahar jane main madad di gai
 Why his look out notice was changed
 jabaki vitt mantri bhi maan rahe hai ki 30 november tak maalya ji par maatr 9 hazaar 91 karod kaa karz tha
 There is so much debt on someone, no one noticed the possibility of his escape
 ho saktaa he
 The amount is so large that everyone's attention must have been spent in counting
 vaise vitt mantri ne ek or udhaaharan se samajhane kaa prayaas kiya ki kwatroki ke bhaagane or maalya ke bhaagane main kyon fark he
 When authorities in Switzerland reported that Quattrocchi was a beneficiary of the Bofors scandal, k Madhavan wrote a letter asking that his passport be confiscated, the government did not stop him and he left the country within two days
 wo ek aapraadhik maamla tha
 This statement reveals the exploits of the Congress, but what happened in Mallya's case gives an answer
 ek puraani ghatana kaa yahaan zikr karnaa chahie
 In January 2015, Priya Pillai, a member of Greenpeace NGO, was barred from going to London
 ve bhaag kar nahin ja rahi thim balki adivaasiyon ke haq main awaz uthaane landan ja rahi thim
 The IB is said to have a lookout notice against him
 teen maheene baad march 2015 main dilli hai court ne priya pillai ke bare main faisla sunaaya ki sarkaar kii niti ke anusaar kisi ke bolne yaa kisi ke haq ke liye Cannot abolish the right to fight
 isliye priya pillai ke passport se of lod remark ko hataaya jaae
 His name should be removed from the list of not being allowed out of the country
 pillai ne bataaya, 'mujhe airport par bataaya gaya ki aap desh se baahar nahin ja sakati hai
 i had all the documents
 mere khilaaf jaanch nahin thi
 There was no case
 phir bhi mujhe roka gaya
 It was a surprise mere khilaaf koi lukout notice bhi jari nahin tha
 ' par kya vijay maalya ke khilaaf koi maamla bhi nahin chal rahaa tha
 a few examples show that they have been circling the courts for a long time or that many departments have been circling the courts to recover from them
 agast 2014 main vijay maalya bangaloru kii ek vishesh adaalat main pesh hote hai
 The Income Tax Department had filed three cases against him
 bangaloru vaala maamla yah he ki vijay maalya ne 400 karod rupee kaa tex sarkaar ko nahin diya tha
 Mallya sahib was granted bail on a bond of one lakh rupees
 adaalat ne aadesh diya ki ve trial main sahyog karenge
 The Income Tax Department had argued that Mallya would not be able to help in the proceedings that he was a non-resident Indian (NRI)
 baahar aate jate rahete hai
 So they may not cooperate in the trial
 ve ek prabhavi bijnesaman bhi hai or satta ke galiyaaron main unka kaaphi rasookh hai
 Another case against him was going on in a court in Mumbai
 aarope tha ki maalya sahab ne upabhoktaaon se liya gaya sarvice tex kaa paisa sarkaar ko nahin diya he
 In this case, he was granted bail by the trial court of Mumbai in February 2015
 sarvice tex vibhaag ne is faisle ko agast 2015 main bobe hoicourt main chunauti di
 On March 11, ie, the Bombay High Court today heard in this case, the service tax department had to hear a lot
 hai court ne kaha ki agar aap nichali adaalat ke zamaanat dene ke faisle se khush nahin the to aapane agast 2015 tak intazaar kyon kiya
 Why have not the lookout notices been issued against them till date, which you want to call for hearing
 or to or vibhaag ko is baat ke liye bhi sunanaa padaa ki uske kaagazat puure nahin he
 The case was that Mallya's company Kingfisher Airlines had not paid 32 crore service tax to the government after recovering from consumers
 sarvice tex vibhaag kaa kahana tha ki maalya kaa passport zabt kar liya jaae lekin court ne kaha tha ki aap ye baat sabit nahin kar paa rahe hai ki maalya adatan apradhi hai
 The second thing is that Mallya has given in writing that if he is present on every hearing, then it does not become a matter that the passport be confiscated
 vijay maalya ne baar baar kaha he ki ve adaalat kaa sammaan karte hai or kanoonee karrwai main madad karte hai, lekin is ghatana se lagata he ki unhone adaalat ke shuruaati bharose ko bhi todaa he
 Both the Income Tax Department and the Service Tax Department feared that Mallya could leave the country as an NRI and it also indicated that these departments did not make concerted efforts to stop Mallya
 bade logon ke maamle main is tarah kii choti galatiyaan ho jaati hai
 The special thing is that such mistakes happen in every government
 patrkaar shekhar gupta ne chalate chalate main state bank of india kii pramukh arundhati bhattacharya se baat kii he

 The question was arising as to why the CBI issued a lookout notice against Mallya and why it was changed

 If it is not denied quickly, it can be amazing
 sibiai ne kaha he ki vijay maalya ke bare main jo pehla lukout notice jari hua tha wo galati se ho gaya tha
 Now tell
 hamaare desh main galati se lukout notice jari ho jaataa he
 In the same way, if the lookout notices are issued by mistake, then you people also keep looking at the airport, do you know if an officer comes to you by mistake, lookout notice
 ab to mujhe yah bhi lagane laga he ki vijay maalya ko prime time dekhte hi bharat aa janaa chahie
 What do all the banks like the CBI say that the debt of 7000 crores is not taken by Vijay Mallya, but by prime time anchor Ravish Kumar
 kya meraa koi darshak landan main he jo kal kaa tikat bhej saktaa he
 i am also ready to go into the economy
 jab sweetsraland ke adhikariyon ne bataaya ki kwatroki boforce ghotaale kaa ek labhaarthi he, ke madhavan ne ek khat likhaa he ki uskaa passport zabt kar liya jaae, tab sarkaar ne use nahin roka or do din ke andar hi usne desh chhod diya
 It was a criminal case
 is bayaan se congress ke karname kaa pataa to chalata he lekin maalya ji ke maamle main jo hua kya uskaa jawaab miltaa he
 An old incident should be mentioned here
 janvari 2015 main greenpis enjio kii sadsy priya pillai ko landan jane se roak diya gaya
 She was not running away but was going to London to raise her voice for the tribals
 hawaii adde par bataaya jaataa he ki ibi kaa unke khilaaf lukout notice he
 Three months later, in March 2015, the Delhi High Court ruled on Priya Pillai that as per the policy of the government, to speak or for the right of someone ladane ke adhikaar ko samaapt nahin kar sakate
 Therefore, the off load remark should be removed from Priya Pillai's passport
 desh se baahar na jane dene kii suchi se unka naam hataaya jaae
 Pillai said, 'I was told at the airport that you cannot go out of the country
 mere paas saare dastauez the
 There was no investigation against me
 koi cese nahin tha
 Still i was stopped
 ye to hairaani vaali baat thi
 There was also no lookout notice issued against me
 ' But was there no ongoing case against Vijay Mallya? chand udaahranon se pataa chalata he ki ve kaaphi lambey samay se adaalaton ke chakkar laga rahe hai yaa kahiye ki kai vibhaag unase vasuulne ke chakkar main adaalaton ke chakkar laga rahe hai
 In August 2014, Vijay Mallya appears in a special court in Bangalore
 unke kilaaf iskar vibhaag ne teen mukademen daayar kiye the
 The case in Bangalore is that Vijay Mallya did not pay tax of Rs 400 crore to the government
 maalya sahab ko ek ek lakh rupee ke muchalke par zamaanat de di gai
 The court ordered that they cooperate in the trial
 iskar vibhaag ne daleel di thi ki maalya karrwai kaarywahi main madad nahin kar paayenge ki ve non racident indian (enarai) hai
 Keep coming out
 isliye ho saktaa he ki wo trial main sahyog na karen
 He is also an effective businessman and has considerable influence in the corridors of power
 unke kilaaf ek or maamla mumbai kii ek adaalat main chal rahaa tha
 It was alleged that Mallya Saheb has not given the service tax money taken from the consumers to the government
 is maamle main unhen mumbai kii nichali adaalat se farvari 2015 main zamaanat mil gai thi
 The service tax department challenged the decision in August 2015 in the Bobbe High Court
 11 march yani aaj bambe hoicourt main isi maamle main sunwaayee hui to sarvice tex vibhaag ko kaaphi kuch sunanaa padaa
 The High Court said that if you were not happy with the lower court's decision to grant bail then why did you wait till August 2015
 aaj tak unke khilaaf lukout notice kyon nahin jari hue hai jinhen aap sunwaayee ke liye bulaanaa chaahate hai
 Moreover, the department also had to listen to the fact that its papers were not complete
 maamla yah tha ki maalya kii company kingfisher airlines ne 32 karod kaa sarvice tex upabhoktaaon se vasuul kar sarkaar ko nahin diya tha
 The service tax department said that Mallya's passport should be confiscated but the court said that you are unable to prove that Mallya is a habitual criminal
 duusari baat ye he ki maalya ne likhit rup main diya he ki ve harek sunwaayee par maujuud rahenge to phir ye maamla nahin banataa he ki passport zabt kar liya jaae
 Vijay Mallya has repeatedly said that he respects the court and helps in legal action, but the incident seems to have broken the initial confidence of the court
 iskar vibhaag or sarvice tex vibhaag donon ko ashanka thi ki enarai hone ke naate maalya desh chhod sakate hai or yah bhi sanket miltaa he ki in vibhaagon ne maalya ko rokane ke liye thos prayaas nahin kiye
 In the case of big people, such small mistakes occur
 khaas baat he ki aisi galatiyaan har sarkaar main ho jaati hai
 Journalist Shekhar Gupta has spoken to Arundhati Bhattacharya, the head of the State Bank of India
 unki baat se aapako yakeen ho jayega ki maalya ke kilaaf vijay praapt karnaa itnaa aasaan nahin he
 It is known from these three examples that departmental action was going on against Vijay Mallya
 media main aar bi ai ke chif raghuram rajan kaa bayaan bhi aa rahaa tha ki maalya jaise logon ko shahi kharch nahin karnaa chahie, isse logon main galat massej jaataa he
 Apart from the political parties, in which account will you show the kindness of all the departments
 unke saat bag main se kisi ek bag main yaa kisi or jhole main
 State Bank of India is searching for Mallya ji to recover his 1500 crores
 tamaam bank apana apana paisa vasuulana chaahate hai
 Mallya has said in his statement that they are trying to resolve the matter by talking to banks but Arundhati Bhattacharya, head of State Bank of India, told Shekhar Gupta something else
 vijay maalya ko hamane van time setlement ke liye ofer diya tha
 He started talking but did not give any formal reply
 isliye ham court ko baar-baar kah rahe the ki asset under oth hamen den
 The asset under oath is that you should write to the court that you have this property and that we have this property and i will give my loan out of it
 jab hamane kingfisher airlines ko doosraa chance diya tab unhone apni personal guarantee di thi
 Therefore, the concept of asset under oath is applied to them
 main yahi kahana chaahati hum ki ham ek hi team hai
 We should all work together
 2012 main kingfisher airlines ghate se guzar rahi thi tab upie sarkaar isaki madad karnaa chaahati thi
 Which was opposed by BJP
 uske chalate upie ke mantriyon ne bayaan diye ki sarkaar kingfisher ko bachaane kaa prayaas nahin kar rahi he
 a few months later Kingfisher got a loan of 1500 crore from State Bank of India
 is puure maamle main bainkon ke bheetar maalya ke haq main faisle lene vaale adhikariyon yaa nideshak kii koi baat hi nahin ho rahi he
 Would they have been completely innocent? ab sawaal he ki saat hazaar karod ke karz ko chukaane ke liye vijay maalya ke paas sampatti he yaa nahin
 Take care of one thing
 sara maamla adaalat main he
 It will be decided by the court that how much liability is incurred on them
 kitna chukaayenge or kitni sazaa hogi
 Nevertheless, it should become a fat thing that how much they have
 faruk abdulla kehete hai ki maalya desh ke liye munafa kamaaya he
 Now you also listen to Arundhati ji of State Bank of India
 wo kis desh ke liye apane bank kaa ghaataa vasuulne ke liye itani ladaai lard rahi hai
 However, various statements are coming about Mallya saheb
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ke bayaan ke ek shabd se sahamat to nahin hum kyonki unhone vijay ji ko safed collar aatankwaadi kah diya he
 Yet Uddhav felt fearlessly about Thackeray that Vijay Mallya would have absolutely no proof about him
 lalit modi ke bhaag jane ke baad jo chilla rahe the, unhen maalya kaise bhaag gaya iskaa jawaab dena hi hoga
 The government is pleading with Pakistan to bring Dawood
 lekin uski nazaron ke saamne white collar aatankwaadi bhaag chukaa he
 Mallya will run away, this child's milk-drinking child is also telling
 lekin sarkaar ko samaj main na aayaa ki achrazbhari baat he
 The alcohol intoxication at Mallya's parties is still running in many veins
 uske utarane ke baad hi baat hogi
 BJP spokesperson Shrikant Sharma has said that Congress has allowed Vijay Mallya to be looted heavily during his tenure
 iskaa matlab he ki bijepi bhi maanati he ki maalya ne lutaa he
 So in the coming days, the BJP will test this, that it is not going to leave Mallya at all
 congress ke manish tiwari ne poocha he ki vijay maalya ko rajyasabha kaa sadsy banane main kis bijepi ke vidhayak ne vot kiya tha
 Whenever the two parties open each other's expectation, the expectation is that now everything will come out
 magar tabhi pardaa girtaa he or doosraa masalaa aa jaataa he
 Hopefully, Vijay Mallya's case will not be as cold as Lalit Modi's
 vaise bhi pravartan nideshaalay ke faisle par amal hua to maalya 18 march ko bharat aa sakate hai
 The comments vijay maalya jaise bade log agar bachaaye nahin gaye to chote logon kaa bada banane main yakeen chalaa jayega
 This can hurt the growth rate of our economy and create fear among foreign investors
 kya vijay maalya kii sampatti zabt kar bank apana paisa vasuul sakenge yah is baat par nirbhar karegi ki media kitni jaldi vijay maalya ke masale ko bhula detaa he jaise lalit modi ke maamle main hua
 If you have taken a bank loan and are unable to repay it then there is a constitutional warning for you
 kripaya karke maalya kii kahani se prerit na hon, ye kahani aapako jeene ke liye majaboor kar sakati he
 One question has been answered in this entire controversy
 sawaal uth rahaa tha ki maalya ke khilaaf sibiai ne lukout notice kyon jari kiya or use kyon badla gaya
 According to PTI, you will take seriously the answer given by CBI
 agar iskaa jaldi khandan nahin kiya gaya to gazab ho saktaa he
 The CBI has said that the first lookout notice issued about Vijay Mallya was in error
 ab bataaiye
 Lookout notice is issued by mistake in our country
 agar isi tarah galati se lukout notice jari hote rahe to aap log bhi airport par lukout karte rahiye, kya pataa koi afasar aapke khilaaf galati se lukout notice lekar aa jaae
 Now i have also started feeling that Vijay Mallya should come to India as soon as he sees prime time
 kya pataa sibiai kii tarah saare bank ye kah den ki 7000 karod kaa karz vijay maalya ne nahin, prime time ke ankar raveesh kumaar ne liya he
 Do i have an audience in London that can send a ticket tomorrow? main to iconomi main bhi jane ke liye taiyaar hum
 This statement reveals the exploits of the Congress, but what happened in Mallya's case gives an answer
 ek puraani ghatana kaa yahaan zikr karnaa chahie
 In January 2015, Priya Pillai, a member of Greenpeace NGO, was barred from going to London
 ve bhaag kar nahin ja rahi thim balki adivaasiyon ke haq main awaz uthaane landan ja rahi thim
 The IB is said to have a lookout notice against him
 teen maheene baad march 2015 main dilli hai court ne priya pillai ke bare main faisla sunaaya ki sarkaar kii niti ke anusaar kisi ke bolne yaa kisi ke haq ke liye Cannot abolish the right to fight
 isliye priya pillai ke passport se of lod remark ko hataaya jaae
 His name should be removed from the list of not being allowed out of the country
 pillai ne bataaya, 'mujhe airport par bataaya gaya ki aap desh se baahar nahin ja sakati hai
 i had all the documents
 mere khilaaf jaanch nahin thi
 There was no case
 phir bhi mujhe roka gaya
 It was a surprise mere khilaaf koi lukout notice bhi jari nahin tha
 ' par kya vijay maalya ke khilaaf koi maamla bhi nahin chal rahaa tha

 sarvice tex vibhaag kaa kahana tha ki maalya kaa passport zabt kar liya jaae lekin court ne kaha tha ki aap ye baat sabit nahin kar paa rahe hai ki maalya adatan apradhi hai
 The second thing is that Mallya has given in writing that if he is present on every hearing, then it does not become a matter that the passport be confiscated
 vijay maalya ne baar baar kaha he ki ve adaalat kaa sammaan karte hai or kanoonee karrwai main madad karte hai, lekin is ghatana se lagata he ki unhone adaalat ke shuruaati bharose ko bhi todaa he
 Both the Income Tax Department and the Service Tax Department feared that Mallya could leave the country as an NRI and it also indicated that these departments did not make concerted efforts to stop Mallya
 bade logon ke maamle main is tarah kii choti galatiyaan ho jaati hai
 The special thing is that such mistakes happen in every government
 patrkaar shekhar gupta ne chalate chalate main state bank of india kii pramukh arundhati bhattacharya se baat kii he
 You will be convinced with his talk that it is not so easy to get victory against Mallya
 in teen udaahranon se gyaat hota he ki vijay maalya ke kilaaf vibhageeya karrwai chal rahi thi
 RBI Chief Raghuram Rajan's statement was also coming in the media that people like Mallya should not spend royalty, this leads to wrong messages among people
 raajnneetik dalon ke alaava tamaam vibhaagon kii meharbaaniyon ko aap kis khate main daalenge
 In one of their seven bags, or in another bag
 bhartiya state bank apane 1500 karod kii vasuuli ke liye maalya ji ko khoj rahaa he
 All banks want to recover their own money
 maalya ne apane bayaan main kaha he ki ve bainkon se baat kar maamla sulajhane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai lekin state bank of india kii pramukh arundhati bhattacharya ne shekhar gupta se kuch or kaha
 We had offered Vijay Mallya for one time settlement
 unhone baat to shuru to kii lekin koi aupchaarik jawaab nahin diya
 That is why we were repeatedly telling the court to give us the asset under Oath
 asset under oth ye he ki aapke paas jitani sampatti he aap court ko likhakar den ki hamaare paas ye sampatti he or main isamen se apana lone de duungaa
 When we gave another chance to Kingfisher Airlines, they gave their personal guarantee
 isliye un par asset under oth kaa concept lagu hota he
 i want to say that we are the same team
 ham sabko milakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Kingfisher Airlines was going through a loss in 2012 when the UPA government wanted to help it
 jiskaa bijepi ne virodh kiya tha
 Due to this, the UPA ministers gave a statement that the government is not trying to save Kingfisher
 kuch hi maheenon baad kingfisher ko bhartiya state bank se 1500 karod kaa lone mil gaya
 In this whole matter, there is no talk of officers or directors taking decisions within the banks in favor of Mallya
 kya ve puri tarah nirdosh rahe honge
 Now the question is whether Vijay Mallya has the property to repay the debt of seven thousand crores
 ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhiyegaa
 The whole matter is in court
 adaalat se hi tay hoga ki un par kitni dendaree banati he
 How much will you pay and how much will be the punishment
 phir bhi ek motaa moti baat ho jaani chahie ki unke paas apana kitna he
 Farooq Abdullah says that Mallya has made a profit for the country
 ab aap state bank of india kii arundhati ji kii bhi suniye
 For which country is she fighting so much to recover her bank losses
 baharhaal maalya sahab ko lekar tarah tarah ke bayaan aa rahe hai
 i do not agree with one word of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray's statement as he has called Vijay ji a white collar terrorist
 phir bhi uddhav thakare kii nirbhikta se laga ki unke bare main to vijay maalya ke paas pakkaa koi saboot nahin hoga
 Those who were screaming after Lalit Modi ran away will have to answer how Mallya ran
 daaud ko laane ke liye sarkaar pakistan ke saamne yachana kar rahi he
 But the white collar terrorist has fled in front of his eyes
 maalya bhaag jayega yah desh kaa doodh peetaa baccha bhi bataa rahaa he
 But the government did not understand that this was a surprise
 maalya kii partiyon main parosi sharaab kaa nasha ab bhi kaiyon ke ragon main daud rahaa he
 It will be only after his landing
 bijepi pravaktaa shrikant sharma ne kaha he ki congress ne apane kaarykaal main vijay maalya ko jamkar luutane kii chhot di he
 This means that BJP also believes that Mallya has looted
 to aane vaale dinon main bijepi ye imtahaan degi ko wo maalya ko bilkul nahin chhodane vaali he
 Manish Tiwari of the Congress has asked which BJP MLA voted to make Vijay Mallya a member of Rajya Sabha
 jab bhi donon partiyaan ek duusare kii pole kholti hai ummid bad jaati he ki ab sab baahar aa jayega
 But then the curtain falls and another issue arises
 ummid he vijay maalya kaa maamla lalit modi kii tarah thanda nahin padegaa
 Anyway, if the decision of the Enforcement Directorate is implemented, Mallya can come to India on 18 March
 tippaniyan If big people like Vijay Mallya are not saved, then small people will believe in becoming big
 isse hamaari arthvyavastha ke growth rate ko nuksaan pahunch saktaa he or videshi niveshkon main dar paidaa ho saktaa he
 Whether banks will be able to recover their money by seizing Vijay Mallya's assets will depend on how soon the media forgets Vijay Mallya's issue like it did in the case of Lalit Modi
 agar aapane bank kaa lone liya he or chukaa nahin paa rahe hai to aapke liye ek sanvaidhanik chetavanee he
 Please do not be inspired by Mallya's story, this story may force you to live
 is puure vivaad main ek sawaal kaa jawaab mil gaya he
 The question was arising as to why the CBI issued a lookout notice against Mallya and why it was changed
 pitiai ke anusaar sibiai ne jo jawaab diya he aap use gambhirtha se lijiega
 If it is not denied quickly, it can be amazing
 sibiai ne kaha he ki vijay maalya ke bare main jo pehla lukout notice jari hua tha wo galati se ho gaya tha
 Now tell
 hamaare desh main galati se lukout notice jari ho jaataa he
 In the same way, if the lookout notices are issued by mistake, then you people also keep looking at the airport, do you know if an officer comes to you by mistake, lookout notice
 ab to mujhe yah bhi lagane laga he ki vijay maalya ko prime time dekhte hi bharat aa janaa chahie
 What do all the banks like the CBI say that the debt of 7000 crores is not taken by Vijay Mallya, but by prime time anchor Ravish Kumar
 kya meraa koi darshak landan main he jo kal kaa tikat bhej saktaa he
 i am also ready to go into the economy
 par kya vijay maalya ke khilaaf koi maamla bhi nahin chal rahaa tha
 a few examples show that they have been circling the courts for a long time or that many departments have been circling the courts to recover from them
 agast 2014 main vijay maalya bangaloru kii ek vishesh adaalat main pesh hote hai
 The Income Tax Department had filed three cases against him
 bangaloru vaala maamla yah he ki vijay maalya ne 400 karod rupee kaa tex sarkaar ko nahin diya tha
 Mallya sahib was granted bail on a bond of one lakh rupees
 adaalat ne aadesh diya ki ve trial main sahyog karenge
 The Income Tax Department had argued that Mallya would not be able to help in the proceedings that he was a non-resident Indian (NRI)
 baahar aate jate rahete hai
 So they may not cooperate in the trial
 ve ek prabhavi bijnesaman bhi hai or satta ke galiyaaron main unka kaaphi rasookh hai
 Another case against him was going on in a court in Mumbai
 aarope tha ki maalya sahab ne upabhoktaaon se liya gaya sarvice tex kaa paisa sarkaar ko nahin diya he
 In this case, he was granted bail by the trial court of Mumbai in February 2015
 sarvice tex vibhaag ne is faisle ko agast 2015 main bobe hoicourt main chunauti di
 On March 11, ie, the Bombay High Court today heard in this case, the service tax department had to hear a lot
 hai court ne kaha ki agar aap nichali adaalat ke zamaanat dene ke faisle se khush nahin the to aapane agast 2015 tak intazaar kyon kiya
 Why have not the lookout notices been issued against them till date, which you want to call for hearing
 or to or vibhaag ko is baat ke liye bhi sunanaa padaa ki uske kaagazat puure nahin he
 The case was that Mallya's company Kingfisher Airlines had not paid 32 crore service tax to the government after recovering from consumers

 unke kilaaf ek or maamla mumbai kii ek adaalat main chal rahaa tha
 It was alleged that Mallya Saheb has not given the service tax money taken from the consumers to the government
 is maamle main unhen mumbai kii nichali adaalat se farvari 2015 main zamaanat mil gai thi
 The service tax department challenged the decision in August 2015 in the Bobbe High Court
 11 march yani aaj bambe hoicourt main isi maamle main sunwaayee hui to sarvice tex vibhaag ko kaaphi kuch sunanaa padaa
 The High Court said that if you were not happy with the lower court's decision to grant bail then why did you wait till August 2015
 aaj tak unke khilaaf lukout notice kyon nahin jari hue hai jinhen aap sunwaayee ke liye bulaanaa chaahate hai
 Moreover, the department also had to listen to the fact that its papers were not complete
 maamla yah tha ki maalya kii company kingfisher airlines ne 32 karod kaa sarvice tex upabhoktaaon se vasuul kar sarkaar ko nahin diya tha
 The service tax department said that Mallya's passport should be confiscated but the court said that you are unable to prove that Mallya is a habitual criminal
 duusari baat ye he ki maalya ne likhit rup main diya he ki ve harek sunwaayee par maujuud rahenge to phir ye maamla nahin banataa he ki passport zabt kar liya jaae
 Vijay Mallya has repeatedly said that he respects the court and helps in legal action, but the incident seems to have broken the initial confidence of the court
 iskar vibhaag or sarvice tex vibhaag donon ko ashanka thi ki enarai hone ke naate maalya desh chhod sakate hai or yah bhi sanket miltaa he ki in vibhaagon ne maalya ko rokane ke liye thos prayaas nahin kiye
 In the case of big people, such small mistakes occur
 khaas baat he ki aisi galatiyaan har sarkaar main ho jaati hai
 Journalist Shekhar Gupta has spoken to Arundhati Bhattacharya, the head of the State Bank of India
 unki baat se aapako yakeen ho jayega ki maalya ke kilaaf vijay praapt karnaa itnaa aasaan nahin he
 It is known from these three examples that departmental action was going on against Vijay Mallya
 media main aar bi ai ke chif raghuram rajan kaa bayaan bhi aa rahaa tha ki maalya jaise logon ko shahi kharch nahin karnaa chahie, isse logon main galat massej jaataa he
 Apart from the political parties, in which account will you show the kindness of all the departments
 unke saat bag main se kisi ek bag main yaa kisi or jhole main
 State Bank of India is searching for Mallya ji to recover his 1500 crores
 tamaam bank apana apana paisa vasuulana chaahate hai
 Mallya has said in his statement that they are trying to resolve the matter by talking to banks but Arundhati Bhattacharya, head of State Bank of India, told Shekhar Gupta something else
 vijay maalya ko hamane van time setlement ke liye ofer diya tha
 He started talking but did not give any formal reply
 isliye ham court ko baar-baar kah rahe the ki asset under oth hamen den
 The asset under oath is that you should write to the court that you have this property and that we have this property and i will give my loan out of it
 jab hamane kingfisher airlines ko doosraa chance diya tab unhone apni personal guarantee di thi
 Therefore, the concept of asset under oath is applied to them
 main yahi kahana chaahati hum ki ham ek hi team hai
 We should all work together
 2012 main kingfisher airlines ghate se guzar rahi thi tab upie sarkaar isaki madad karnaa chaahati thi
 Which was opposed by BJP
 uske chalate upie ke mantriyon ne bayaan diye ki sarkaar kingfisher ko bachaane kaa prayaas nahin kar rahi he
 a few months later Kingfisher got a loan of 1500 crore from State Bank of India
 is puure maamle main bainkon ke bheetar maalya ke haq main faisle lene vaale adhikariyon yaa nideshak kii koi baat hi nahin ho rahi he
 Would they have been completely innocent? ab sawaal he ki saat hazaar karod ke karz ko chukaane ke liye vijay maalya ke paas sampatti he yaa nahin
 Take care of one thing
 sara maamla adaalat main he
 It will be decided by the court that how much liability is incurred on them
 kitna chukaayenge or kitni sazaa hogi
 Nevertheless, it should become a fat thing that how much they have
 faruk abdulla kehete hai ki maalya desh ke liye munafa kamaaya he
 Now you also listen to Arundhati ji of State Bank of India
 wo kis desh ke liye apane bank kaa ghaataa vasuulne ke liye itani ladaai lard rahi hai
 However, various statements are coming about Mallya saheb
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ke bayaan ke ek shabd se sahamat to nahin hum kyonki unhone vijay ji ko safed collar aatankwaadi kah diya he
 Yet Uddhav felt fearlessly about Thackeray that Vijay Mallya would have absolutely no proof about him
 lalit modi ke bhaag jane ke baad jo chilla rahe the, unhen maalya kaise bhaag gaya iskaa jawaab dena hi hoga
 The government is pleading with Pakistan to bring Dawood
 lekin uski nazaron ke saamne white collar aatankwaadi bhaag chukaa he
 Mallya will run away, this child's milk-drinking child is also telling
 lekin sarkaar ko samaj main na aayaa ki achrazbhari baat he
 The alcohol intoxication at Mallya's parties is still running in many veins
 uske utarane ke baad hi baat hogi
 BJP spokesperson Shrikant Sharma has said that Congress has allowed Vijay Mallya to be looted heavily during his tenure
 iskaa matlab he ki bijepi bhi maanati he ki maalya ne lutaa he
 So in the coming days, the BJP will test this, that it is not going to leave Mallya at all
 congress ke manish tiwari ne poocha he ki vijay maalya ko rajyasabha kaa sadsy banane main kis bijepi ke vidhayak ne vot kiya tha
 Whenever the two parties open each other's expectation, the expectation is that now everything will come out
 magar tabhi pardaa girtaa he or doosraa masalaa aa jaataa he
 Hopefully, Vijay Mallya's case will not be as cold as Lalit Modi's
 vaise bhi pravartan nideshaalay ke faisle par amal hua to maalya 18 march ko bharat aa sakate hai
 The comments vijay maalya jaise bade log agar bachaaye nahin gaye to chote logon kaa bada banane main yakeen chalaa jayega
 This can hurt the growth rate of our economy and create fear among foreign investors
 kya vijay maalya kii sampatti zabt kar bank apana paisa vasuul sakenge yah is baat par nirbhar karegi ki media kitni jaldi vijay maalya ke masale ko bhula detaa he jaise lalit modi ke maamle main hua
 If you have taken a bank loan and are unable to repay it then there is a constitutional warning for you
 kripaya karke maalya kii kahani se prerit na hon, ye kahani aapako jeene ke liye majaboor kar sakati he
 One question has been answered in this entire controversy
 sawaal uth rahaa tha ki maalya ke khilaaf sibiai ne lukout notice kyon jari kiya or use kyon badla gaya
 According to PTI, you will take seriously the answer given by CBI
 agar iskaa jaldi khandan nahin kiya gaya to gazab ho saktaa he
 The CBI has said that the first lookout notice issued about Vijay Mallya was in error
 ab bataaiye
 Lookout notice is issued by mistake in our country
 agar isi tarah galati se lukout notice jari hote rahe to aap log bhi airport par lukout karte rahiye, kya pataa koi afasar aapke khilaaf galati se lukout notice lekar aa jaae
 Now i have also started feeling that Vijay Mallya should come to India as soon as he sees prime time
 kya pataa sibiai kii tarah saare bank ye kah den ki 7000 karod kaa karz vijay maalya ne nahin, prime time ke ankar raveesh kumaar ne liya he
 Do i have an audience in London that can send a ticket tomorrow? main to iconomi main bhi jane ke liye taiyaar hum

 It is known from these three examples that departmental action was going on against Vijay Mallya
 media main aar bi ai ke chif raghuram rajan kaa bayaan bhi aa rahaa tha ki maalya jaise logon ko shahi kharch nahin karnaa chahie, isse logon main galat massej jaataa he
 Apart from the political parties, in which account will you show the kindness of all the departments
 unke saat bag main se kisi ek bag main yaa kisi or jhole main
 State Bank of India is searching for Mallya ji to recover his 1500 crores
 tamaam bank apana apana paisa vasuulana chaahate hai
 Mallya has said in his statement that they are trying to resolve the matter by talking to banks but Arundhati Bhattacharya, head of State Bank of India, told Shekhar Gupta something else
 vijay maalya ko hamane van time setlement ke liye ofer diya tha
 He started talking but did not give any formal reply
 isliye ham court ko baar-baar kah rahe the ki asset under oth hamen den
 The asset under oath is that you should write to the court that you have this property and that we have this property and i will give my loan out of it
 jab hamane kingfisher airlines ko doosraa chance diya tab unhone apni personal guarantee di thi
 Therefore, the concept of asset under oath is applied to them
 main yahi kahana chaahati hum ki ham ek hi team hai
 We should all work together
 2012 main kingfisher airlines ghate se guzar rahi thi tab upie sarkaar isaki madad karnaa chaahati thi
 Which was opposed by BJP
 uske chalate upie ke mantriyon ne bayaan diye ki sarkaar kingfisher ko bachaane kaa prayaas nahin kar rahi he
 a few months later Kingfisher got a loan of 1500 crore from State Bank of India
 is puure maamle main bainkon ke bheetar maalya ke haq main faisle lene vaale adhikariyon yaa nideshak kii koi baat hi nahin ho rahi he
 Would they have been completely innocent? ab sawaal he ki saat hazaar karod ke karz ko chukaane ke liye vijay maalya ke paas sampatti he yaa nahin
 Take care of one thing
 sara maamla adaalat main he
 It will be decided by the court that how much liability is incurred on them
 kitna chukaayenge or kitni sazaa hogi
 Nevertheless, it should become a fat thing that how much they have
 faruk abdulla kehete hai ki maalya desh ke liye munafa kamaaya he
 Now you also listen to Arundhati ji of State Bank of India
 wo kis desh ke liye apane bank kaa ghaataa vasuulne ke liye itani ladaai lard rahi hai
 However, various statements are coming about Mallya saheb
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ke bayaan ke ek shabd se sahamat to nahin hum kyonki unhone vijay ji ko safed collar aatankwaadi kah diya he
 Yet Uddhav felt fearlessly about Thackeray that Vijay Mallya would have absolutely no proof about him
 lalit modi ke bhaag jane ke baad jo chilla rahe the, unhen maalya kaise bhaag gaya iskaa jawaab dena hi hoga
 The government is pleading with Pakistan to bring Dawood
 lekin uski nazaron ke saamne white collar aatankwaadi bhaag chukaa he
 Mallya will run away, this child's milk-drinking child is also telling
 lekin sarkaar ko samaj main na aayaa ki achrazbhari baat he
 The alcohol intoxication at Mallya's parties is still running in many veins
 uske utarane ke baad hi baat hogi
 BJP spokesperson Shrikant Sharma has said that Congress has allowed Vijay Mallya to be looted heavily during his tenure
 iskaa matlab he ki bijepi bhi maanati he ki maalya ne lutaa he
 So in the coming days, the BJP will test this, that it is not going to leave Mallya at all
 congress ke manish tiwari ne poocha he ki vijay maalya ko rajyasabha kaa sadsy banane main kis bijepi ke vidhayak ne vot kiya tha
 Whenever the two parties open each other's expectation, the expectation is that now everything will come out
 magar tabhi pardaa girtaa he or doosraa masalaa aa jaataa he
 Hopefully, Vijay Mallya's case will not be as cold as Lalit Modi's
 vaise bhi pravartan nideshaalay ke faisle par amal hua to maalya 18 march ko bharat aa sakate hai
 The comments vijay maalya jaise bade log agar bachaaye nahin gaye to chote logon kaa bada banane main yakeen chalaa jayega
 This can hurt the growth rate of our economy and create fear among foreign investors
 kya vijay maalya kii sampatti zabt kar bank apana paisa vasuul sakenge yah is baat par nirbhar karegi ki media kitni jaldi vijay maalya ke masale ko bhula detaa he jaise lalit modi ke maamle main hua
 If you have taken a bank loan and are unable to repay it then there is a constitutional warning for you
 kripaya karke maalya kii kahani se prerit na hon, ye kahani aapako jeene ke liye majaboor kar sakati he
 One question has been answered in this entire controversy
 sawaal uth rahaa tha ki maalya ke khilaaf sibiai ne lukout notice kyon jari kiya or use kyon badla gaya
 According to PTI, you will take seriously the answer given by CBI
 agar iskaa jaldi khandan nahin kiya gaya to gazab ho saktaa he
 The CBI has said that the first lookout notice issued about Vijay Mallya was in error
 ab bataaiye
 Lookout notice is issued by mistake in our country
 agar isi tarah galati se lukout notice jari hote rahe to aap log bhi airport par lukout karte rahiye, kya pataa koi afasar aapke khilaaf galati se lukout notice lekar aa jaae
 Now i have also started feeling that Vijay Mallya should come to India as soon as he sees prime time
 kya pataa sibiai kii tarah saare bank ye kah den ki 7000 karod kaa karz vijay maalya ne nahin, prime time ke ankar raveesh kumaar ne liya he
 Do i have an audience in London that can send a ticket tomorrow? main to iconomi main bhi jane ke liye taiyaar hum
 We had offered Vijay Mallya for one time settlement
 unhone baat to shuru to kii lekin koi aupchaarik jawaab nahin diya
 That is why we were repeatedly telling the court to give us the asset under Oath
 asset under oth ye he ki aapke paas jitani sampatti he aap court ko likhakar den ki hamaare paas ye sampatti he or main isamen se apana lone de duungaa
 When we gave another chance to Kingfisher Airlines, they gave their personal guarantee
 isliye un par asset under oth kaa concept lagu hota he
 i want to say that we are the same team
 ham sabko milakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Kingfisher Airlines was going through a loss in 2012 when the UPA government wanted to help it
 jiskaa bijepi ne virodh kiya tha
 Due to this, the UPA ministers gave a statement that the government is not trying to save Kingfisher
 kuch hi maheenon baad kingfisher ko bhartiya state bank se 1500 karod kaa lone mil gaya
 In this whole matter, there is no talk of officers or directors taking decisions within the banks in favor of Mallya
 kya ve puri tarah nirdosh rahe honge
 Now the question is whether Vijay Mallya has the property to repay the debt of seven thousand crores
 ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhiyegaa
 The whole matter is in court
 adaalat se hi tay hoga ki un par kitni dendaree banati he
 How much will you pay and how much will be the punishment
 phir bhi ek motaa moti baat ho jaani chahie ki unke paas apana kitna he
 Farooq Abdullah says that Mallya has made a profit for the country
 ab aap state bank of india kii arundhati ji kii bhi suniye
 For which country is she fighting so much to recover her bank losses
 baharhaal maalya sahab ko lekar tarah tarah ke bayaan aa rahe hai
 i do not agree with one word of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray's statement as he has called Vijay ji a white collar terrorist
 phir bhi uddhav thakare kii nirbhikta se laga ki unke bare main to vijay maalya ke paas pakkaa koi saboot nahin hoga
 Those who were screaming after Lalit Modi ran away will have to answer how Mallya ran
 daaud ko laane ke liye sarkaar pakistan ke saamne yachana kar rahi he
 But the white collar terrorist has fled in front of his eyes
 maalya bhaag jayega yah desh kaa doodh peetaa baccha bhi bataa rahaa he
 But the government did not understand that this was a surprise
 maalya kii partiyon main parosi sharaab kaa nasha ab bhi kaiyon ke ragon main daud rahaa he
 It will be only after his landing
 bijepi pravaktaa shrikant sharma ne kaha he ki congress ne apane kaarykaal main vijay maalya ko jamkar luutane kii chhot di he
 This means that BJP also believes that Mallya has looted
 to aane vaale dinon main bijepi ye imtahaan degi ko wo maalya ko bilkul nahin chhodane vaali he
 Manish Tiwari of the Congress has asked which BJP MLA voted to make Vijay Mallya a member of Rajya Sabha
 jab bhi donon partiyaan ek duusare kii pole kholti hai ummid bad jaati he ki ab sab baahar aa jayega
 But then the curtain falls and another issue arises
 ummid he vijay maalya kaa maamla lalit modi kii tarah thanda nahin padegaa
 Anyway, if the decision of the Enforcement Directorate is implemented, Mallya can come to India on 18 March
 tippaniyan If big people like Vijay Mallya are not saved, then small people will believe in becoming big
 isse hamaari arthvyavastha ke growth rate ko nuksaan pahunch saktaa he or videshi niveshkon main dar paidaa ho saktaa he
 Whether banks will be able to recover their money by seizing Vijay Mallya's assets will depend on how soon the media forgets Vijay Mallya's issue like it did in the case of Lalit Modi
 agar aapane bank kaa lone liya he or chukaa nahin paa rahe hai to aapke liye ek sanvaidhanik chetavanee he
 Please do not be inspired by Mallya's story, this story may force you to live
 is puure vivaad main ek sawaal kaa jawaab mil gaya he
 The question was arising as to why the CBI issued a lookout notice against Mallya and why it was changed
 pitiai ke anusaar sibiai ne jo jawaab diya he aap use gambhirtha se lijiega
 If it is not denied quickly, it can be amazing
 sibiai ne kaha he ki vijay maalya ke bare main jo pehla lukout notice jari hua tha wo galati se ho gaya tha
 Now tell
 hamaare desh main galati se lukout notice jari ho jaataa he
 In the same way, if the lookout notices are issued by mistake, then you people also keep looking at the airport, do you know if an officer comes to you by mistake, lookout notice
 ab to mujhe yah bhi lagane laga he ki vijay maalya ko prime time dekhte hi bharat aa janaa chahie
 What do all the banks like the CBI say that the debt of 7000 crores is not taken by Vijay Mallya, but by prime time anchor Ravish Kumar
 kya meraa koi darshak landan main he jo kal kaa tikat bhej saktaa he
 i am also ready to go into the economy

 In such a situation, Rayudu's absence from the World Cup team is the only disappointment

 Feeling very fresh? i have worked hard
 maine thaan liya he ki sharir ko har film ke saath behatar karuunga
 If i did nothing for four years, i realized that i should look good
 main apana khyaal nahin rakhata tha
 Nothing is known when you go through ups and downs
 mere bachche mujhe dekhte the to sochate the ki papa ghar par hi rahete hai
 This thing was being eaten by me because i grew up seeing my father, who used to work every day
 ye baaten mujhe jatke se samaj main ain
 Anyway, work can come at any time, but if you are not ready, then that work gets out of hand
 poster boij ke ek saal pehle se maine taiyaari shuru kar di thi
 i used to sleep at 9 o'clock at night
 subah 3 baje uthakar kasarat kiya karata tha
 Started eating the right kind
 main pehle prashanth ke saath training letaa tha

 Take care of yourself '3
 You took off the shirt in the film? When i did 'soldier', Ramesh Taurani (producer of the race) wanted me to take off my shirt, but i wore a sleeveless T-shirt at that time
 jab 'res 3' kii baat chal rahi thi to salmaan chaahate the ki main unke saath film main rahun' lekin ramesh ji ne kaha kii wo shart nahin utaarata
 Then Salman got a call and he said that Bobby will take off the shirt
 maine kaha ki maamu main kuch bhi karuunga
 Then i started working harder
 mujhe lagata he ki 'housephul 4' main main zyada acha dikhuunga
 i just can't see
 salmaan ne kaha ki mujhe ab har film main shart utaarani padegi

 Father, brother is very happy
 mere papa or salmaan kaa acha band he
 Father always says that what i could not do, Salman did it

 Salman is a very selfless person
 wo logon kii help karte rahete hai
 6
 chaar saal kaam kyon nahin mila ?pataa nahin, sabakuch dhimaa ho gaya tha
 i used to think why i am not getting good work
 kaaphi apaset bhi tha
 Due to lack of work, i thought to produce a film myself
 film main dark role ke liye maine dadhi banaai thi, lekin film nahin ban pai
 i had shaved after that
 uske baad laga ki mujhe dadhi nahin ugaani chahie thi
 By the way, the producers say that i do not look poor
 main bas kaam karnaa chahta hum
 Want to work for fans us daur main mujhe kisi kaa saath nahin mila
 Only you can understand your pain, you can help yourself
 parivaar hameshaa pyaar karata he, lekin aapaki khushi main hi unki khushi hoti he
 Nephew Karan, afraid of Bobby Deol, said - i am not like brother Sunny 7

 Then i cried and survived
 rone ke baad saamne vaale ko taras aa jaataa he
 In the same way Papa had gently hit me on the cheek before the board exam and i started crying

 What movies do you want to do? i want to do action films
 'yamala pagalaa divaana 1' to chali thi, lekin 2 nahin chalin

 aadhikarik sutron ne bataaya ki saamaanya halaat main kareeb 10 companiyaan ( 1,000 jawan ) ek sansadeey kshetra main matdaan ke dauraan tainaat kii jaati hai
 Barhahal, the Home Ministry is likely to say to the Election Commission that it would be difficult to arrange such a large number of security personnel in such a short period of time
 philhal, kareeb 150 companiyaan muhaiyaa karne kii hi sthiti main he
 At the same time, the PDP, which is in the ruling coalition in Jammu and Kashmir, has requested the Election Commission to postpone the Anantnag by-election indefinitely in view of the turbulent situation there
 havas, ranginiyaan or besharmi
 Of course, the picture flashed in the mind after listening to these words has no place for saints, priests and babas
 lekin duniya main kuch aise bhi baba hai jo havas or ranginiyon main is kadar duube hai unki karatootein dekh or sun kar kisi ko bhi shame aa jaae
 In the past, the form of Asaram and many such babas came to the fore, which opened the doors of these babas who taught the lesson of Guru's Chola Odh Satsang
 nishchay hi aapane in baabaaon ke kaale karnaamon ko dekha or hoga
 The year 2013 showed us many forms of Baba
 bade-bade baabaaon par besharm iljaam lage
 He went to jail and some are still in jail
 vahiin, ab isi kadi main sabase taaja naam jud gaya he badrinaath dham ke mukhya pujari keshav namboodri kaa
 Baba Keshav Namboodari, who once wore a garland among priests, is currently under the grip of the Mehrauli police
 unke saath hi rishte main unka bhai vishnu pradhan bhi hiraasat main he, jo baba ke karnaamon main unka saath detaa tha
 According to the police, Baba Namboodri came to Delhi on 3 February
 dilli ke chhatarpur ilaake main wo vishnu ke saath dilite in hotel main tehra tha
 The father said, Babakoul is like a god, a devotee of Police Baba has a hotel in Badrinath
 3 farvari ko hotel main check in karne ke baad shaam kareeb chaar baje baba ne dilli main rahane vaali apane usee bhakt kii beti ko phone kiya
 Baba tells him on the phone that he has come to Delhi and wants to meet
 ladki ne kaha ki uski tabiyat thik nahin he, lekin baba ne kaha ki agle din wo waapas badrinaath laut jaaenge isile aaj hi milanaa padegaa
 The girl called her father and told the whole thing
 pita ne beti ko samajhaayaa ki wo jaakar baba se mil le kyonki wo unke parivaar ke liye bhagwaan samaan hai
 The girl agreed to meet Baba at the behest of the father-in-law on Baba's intention
 vah baba ko phone par bataati he ki vah aa rahi he
 Baba asks if she is coming alone? The girl states that she is coming with the driver
 bakaul police iske baad ladki shaam ko hotel ke liye nikal padati he, lekin use baba kii niyat par shaq ho gaya tha
 The girl called her husband by the way and told the whole thing
 akele aane kii baat sun kar pati ko bhi shaq hua
 He instructed that when he reached Baba's room, put his phone on so that he could hear all the things and help in case of danger
 cigarette kaa dhuna or ashleel harakateinpati ke bataae tareeke par amal karte hue ladki bina phone kaate baba ke kamare main pahunchati he
 According to the police, when the girl reached the room, both Baba and Vishnu were present there
 lekin ladki ke pahunchate hi vishnu kamare se nikal jaataa he
 According to the girl, when she entered the room, the room was filled with cigarette smoke and Baba was almost intoxicated
 vishnu ke jate hi baba ne ladki ke saath ashleel harakatein kerani shuru kar deen
 The girl had realized Baba's intentions completely, so somehow she pushed Baba and opened the door of the room and ran downstairs
 pati sun rahaa tha sari bataldaki kaa phone lagaataar on hone ke kaaran duusari taraf uskaa pati sari baaten sun rahaa tha
 He immediately called the driver standing down from another phone and reached the hotel gate
 kisi tarah ladki bhaagti hui hotel ke neeche ai or car main baith vahaan se nikal bhaagi
 After coming out of the hotel, the girl informed the police, after which the Mehrauli police raided the hotel and arrested Baba and his brother the same night
 baad main donon ko adaalat main pesh kiya gaya jahaan se unhen 14 dinon ke liye nyaayik hiraasat main tihaad jail bhej diya gaya he
 Baba Vikasananda's Raslilasal is imprisoned in the Cidies This is not the first story of vicious babas in Guru and Baba's dress in early 2014
 jabalpur ke baba vikasanand kaa asal cheharaa bhi kuch aisa hi he
 He is one of those Baba's who used to be a devil in the day and night
 vikasanand din main baba kaa rup dharte to raat main ladakiyon ke sang naachte or kabhi swimming pool main nahaate bhi hai
 Baba's reach can be gauged from the fact that Baba was sent straight to Jabalpur jail four years ago after being caught celebrating with three girls in a hotel in Bhopal
 baba kii ye hakeekat shaayad kabhi bhi saamne nahin aa paati, lekin ek din police tafteesh ke dauraan baba ke ashram ja pahunchi or vahaan baba kii ek do nahin balki puri 60 aisi sediyaan milin jinamein baba kii puri raasalila kaid he
 Baba is currently serving his sentence in Jabalpur jail
 baap-bete kii daastanasaram or unke bete narayan sai ko bhi unke bhakt bhagwaan kii tarah puujate the
 But one by one, everyone was shocked when the saint's mask landed on both father and son's faces

 In September last year, the Supreme Court, announcing a landmark ruling, repealed Section 377 (section 377), which made homosexual relationships with consent a crime

 rajasthan main congress ne sarkaar bhale hi bana lee ho lekin sarkaar ke andar khinchataan kaa daur jari he
 So far Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot, who are attacking each other in gestures, have now come face to face
 sachin payalat kah rahe hai ki janata ne ashok gahalot ke naam par vot nahin diya or aisa hi aarope ashok gahalot bhi sachin payalat par laga rahe hai
 It is said about Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot that he (ashok Gehlot) knows when, where and how much to speak
 bajet pesh karne ke baad patrakaron se baat karte hue ashok gahalot ne mukhyamantri banane ke 8 maheene baad aakhirkaar up mukhyamantri sachin payalat ko saaf kar diya ki vah rajasthan kaa mukhyamantri banane kaa mansuba naa paalen
 Ashok Gehlot said that people have voted in his name in the assembly elections
 unako mukhyamantri banane ke liye vot die hai
 That is why the Congress Party has made him Chief Minister
 kisi or ke naam par vot nahin mili hai
 Those who were not even in the race to become Chief Minister are also bringing forward their names
 darasal kaha ja rahaa he ki mukhyamantri ashok gahalot up mukhyamantri sachin payalat ke mukhyamantri banane ke chupe hue abhiyaan se pareshaan hai or bajet pesh karne ke baad is mudde par aar-paar karne ke mood main hai
 Gehlot has also cleared the high command in gestures - i am the boss of Rajasthan
 yahaan do netaa nahin chalenge, lekin 5 saal tak rajasthan kaa pradesh adhyaksh rahakar vidhansabha chunaav main netritv karne vaale noujvaan netaa sachin payalat kahaan chup baithne vaale the
 The pilot feels that we worked hard for 5 years and when the time came to eat cream, Gehlot was dripping
 payalat ko lagata tha ki loksabhaa chunaav ke baad congress ke rashtriya adhyaksh rahul gandhi unako mauka denge magar koi kuch nahin bol rahaa he to payalat kii bhi besabri badhani laazmi he
 Without asking questions from the reporters, Pilot said that the government in Rajasthan is made by the hard work of the workers and is made in the name of Rahul Gandhi and not in the name of anyone else
 payalat ne bajet par bolne ke liye patrakaron ko bulaayaa tha magar kisi ne ashok gahalot ke bayaan par pratikriya nahin maangi to khud hi bol diya or patrakaron ko yah bhi kah diya ki aap log kathin sawaal nahin poochhate
 It is believed that the battle between the two in Rajasthan has reached such a level that if no decision is taken on this issue soon, it will not be good for the party and it will not be easy for the Congress to run the government in the state

 Choksi argued that he is a citizen of Antigua
 lihaaja usko bharat kii apil main hiraasat main lene yaa pratyrpan karne kaa koi vaid aadhaar nahin he
 Doing so would violate his fundamental rights
 usne yah bhi kaha ki antigua or bharat ke bich pratyrpan ko lekar koi samjhauta bhi nahin he
 In such a case, the court should declare that its extradition attempts are illegal
 mehul chokasee ke pratyrpan ko lekar bharat kii rajanyik koshishon ko us samay bal mila tha, jab antigua athurity ne iske sakaaratmak sanket die the
 The Antigua government had indicated to the Indian government that there is no bilateral agreement with him on extradition, but Choksi's extradition is possible nonetheless
 vahiin, mangalvaar ko neerav modi kii firestar diamond international or mehul chokasee kii gitanjali james ne dilli hoicourt main daakhil apni yachika ko waapas le liya he
 Both the companies had moved the High Court against the ED action

 According to sources, when India was informed of Choksi's presence in the Caribbean Islands, the move was taken as part of the extradition attempt by the Modi government
 sutron ne bataaya ki bharat antigua ke sampark main he
 The officers there have been requested to stop the movement of Choksi by land, water or air route

 ' duniya kii sabase puraani sabhyaataaon main se ek maane jane vaali sindhu ghati sabhyataa jisaki pahchaan he mohanjodado se mili prasiddh 'daancing girl' kii murti
 Historians and archaeologists have been making different estimates about this statue
 aise hi ek akalan main yah daawa kiya gaya he ki yah daancing girl kii murti darasal parvati kii he jisase yah pataa chalata he ki sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log shivaji ke upaask the
 This claim has recently been made in a new research paper published in the Hindi journal 'history' of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR)

 At the same time, Varma has described the idol of this 'dancing girl' of 2500 BC as the Hindu goddess Parvati, which is the first claim in itself
 research peper main mohenjodaro ke anya pratikon kaa bhi akalan karte hue kaha gaya he ki us sabhyataa ke dauraan shiv kii puja kii jaati thi
 Varma says that in the famous 'seal 420', the way a seal shows the yogi and the animals standing around it, it is clear that Shiva was worshiped at that time
 verma ne yah daawa bhi kiya he ki daancing girl isliye bhi parvati he kyonki jahaan shiv honge, vahaan shakti bhi hogi
 However, some other historians differ on this
 indian express se hi baat karte hue jeenyu kii professor supriya verma kahati he ki aaj tak kisi bhi puraattatvavid ne daancing girl ko devi nahin bataaya, parvati to chhod hi dijie
 This idol has always been seen as a statue of a young woman

 The comments bataa den ki isi saal oktober main pakistan main ek vakil ne lahore ucch nyaayalay se guhaar lagaai thi ki vah sarkaar ko bharat se mashhoor 'daancing girl' murti waapas laane kaa nirdesh de
 The petitioner claimed that this ancient bronze statue was originated from Mohenjodaro and sent to India about 60 years ago for display at the request of the National Arts Council of Delhi
 bharat ne baad main us murti ko lautaane se inkaar kar diya
 It is worth mentioning that many famous archaeologists of the world have described this idol as the most attractive of all the artefacts excavated in Mohenjodaro in search of Indus civilization

 During the Mumbai Manthan, when asked a question as to why Kajol and her husband do such edits in which common things like handwashing are told, Kajol said that this is the first step to avoid diseases
 is baat ko jitna ho sake utana failaane kii jarurat he taaki bachche or log bimariyon se bache rahen
 Kajol says that people often ask them why they need to tell so much about the matter of hand cleaning, they are not surprised
 aisa isliye hota he kyonki bahut saare log is baat ke mahatv ko hi nahin jaanate hai
 Kajol further says that she also realized this when she became a mother
 maa banane ke baad aapaki jimmedaariyaan achaanak se bad jaati hai or bachche kii safai or haath dhokar bachche ko chune jaisi aam baaten aapako koi nahin bataata
 Only the doctor tells you that for 40 days you have to touch the child only after continuously washing your hands and you have to do any work
 jab main pehali baar maa bani thi or mujhe handwash kitna emportent hota he pataa chalaa tha to kaimeri ajayase bhi is baat ko lekar ladaai ho jaati thi
 Because i liked cleaning so much
 shaayad inhen choti-choti jaankariyon ke bare main avayeranes na hone kii vajah se hi hamaare desh main bacchon main nimonia, diaria jaisi bimaariyaan zyada dekhne ko milti hai
 Therefore, if small campaigns are run then they reach more people
 bacchon ke poshan ke liye khud bhi haathon kii safai karne or bacchon ko bhi ise apnaane kii aadat daalen

 BJP has fielded Kiran Bedi 20 days before the election and has given its strong and surprising bets, but do Delhi BJP workers agree with the party's decision? From what is happening in Delhi right now, at least it is evident that the workers are not enthusiastic about their new candidate
 party main shaamil hone ke agle din hi kaaryakartaaon se apni pehali baithak main bedi ne jo lehza or tevar dikhaaya, usee din lagane laga tha ki party ke haikaman ne bedi ko thik taiyaari se nahin bheja
 Kiran Bedi was seen scolding the workers and giving orders to listen to herself
 jahaan ek taraf narendra modi kaaryakartaaon ko apni jeet kaa hissedaar banaate hai, vahaan itani talkhi kaaryakartaaon main baithak ke dauraan sugabugahat paidaa karne ke liye kaaphi thi
 After Kiran Bedi, Delhi BJP leaders continued to welcome people from other parties
 kiran bedi ko mukhyamantri ummidavaar banaaya gaya or apane puraane satta sangharshrat netaaon ko kinare laga kar duusari partiyon ke logon ko tikat bhi diya gaya
 Due to lack of experience, Kiran Bedi is not aware of political modesty and etiquette when she sat down with Harshavardhan
 harshavardhan ke purv vidhansabha kshetra krishna nagar se namit hokar jab vahaan kaaryakartaaon se milane pahunchi to harshavardhan zindaabad ke naare hi sunai pade
 As Kiran Bedi stood up to speak, the worker standing on the stage had to appeal to the other workers to listen to Kiran Bedi once
 bich bich main kisi ne bedi ko vyangyatamak dhanyavad bhi kar diya taaki wo bolnaa band karen
 When Kiran Bedi went to file her nomination, her roadshow was much lighter than Arvind Kejriwal had hoped
 vaise bhi road sho or reliyaan kaaryakartaaon ke utsaah se banate hai
 When Satish Upadhyay's ticket was cut, his supporters were busy shouting slogans against Kiran Bedi more than garnering support for her ticket

 Credit goes to filmmakers like Shekhar Kapoor, Anurag Kashyap and Ram Gopal Varma
 in dinon kuch actors kah rahe hai ki unhone cinema main yah badlaav laayaa he, lekin sahi nahin he
 Whenever there has been a change in the film industry, it is only because of the filmmakers
 navaj ne aage kaha- ''actors small toun main shooting kar rahe hai yah koi nai baat nahin he
 It has also been shown in films like Dev d earlier
 aap aisa kyon kah rahe he ki cinema badal rahaa he
 Content-driven cinema is taking shape
 mujhe lagata he ki jis parivartan ko aap dekh rahe hai vah abhi-abhi nahin hua he
 Nawaz said, "the definition of content-based cinema includes everything that makes a masala entertainer film
" aapako ek film main 4-5 gane shaamil karne kii jarurat he
 Whatever the subject you want to keep a little fun and humor too
 mujhe lagata he ki hardkor cinema kii logon tak pahunch nishchit hoti he
 He also said, there is no big change in cinema yet
 lekin yah nishchit rup se jarur hoga

 kai baar lakhon rupaya kharch karne ke baad bhi aapkaa ghar vaisaa nahin jagamagaataa jaise ki aap kalpana karte hai
 The correct choice of interior and slight omission in decoration may be the reason for this
 aaie aapako 5 aise tips bataate hai jinaki madad se aapkaa ghar pehle se zyada aakarshak ho jayega
 This should be the color of the walls - if your house is small enough, then painting it in dark color would be the wrong choice
 wal par dark paint ke saath jagah choti lagati he or ghar main andhera sa chaaya rahata he
 So try to get white or any light shade painted in the house
 aisa karne se ghar main mini balb jalaane par bhi zyada roshni kaa ehsaas hoga
 It would be even better if you use light-shed curtains and bedsheets while matching the bedsheets and curtains and walls
 ghar main lite color ke parde or chadar istemaal karne se choti jagah bhi badi lagane lagati he
 Also, if you have big windows on your walls, it will be even better
 furniture kaa sahi istemaal-ghar ke andar kaa furniture mini sies main ho or sabhi kaa shed lite color main ho to ghar kii chamak doguni ho jaati he
 Any furniture like bed, dressing table, table or almirah should be slightly smaller than normal and should be light colored
 isamen aap lite green, grey, pink yaa duusare kisi bhi color kaa istemaal sahuuliyat ke hisaab se kar sakate hai
 Light and flooring - Reflecting flooring is also a good option in a dark room, which can increase the brightness in the room
 saath hi saath aap zyada roshni vaali lits kaa istemaal karen to behatar hoga
 For light decoration at home, you can use the lights of a company called Tiswa
 isaki lits main demable spotlits va down lits jaisi japani takanic shaamil he
 One unique thing in its lights is that you can also change the color of the lights according to the wallpants of your home
 saath hi aap lite kii power ko fain speed kii tarah kam yaa zyada bhi kar sakate hai
