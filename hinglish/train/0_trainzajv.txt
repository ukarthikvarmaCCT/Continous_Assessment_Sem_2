 Please mention the name of Mr
 Visvesaraya ji at least 5 times during the 15 minute speech
 bas media main heldine bich gai ki modi ne diya jawaab rahul ko
 Did give exactly but what Rahul said
 23 april ko rahul gandhi ne kaha tha ki neerav modi ji kaa maamla he, lalit modi kaa maamla he, vijay maalya kaa maamla he, rafel kaa maamla he, narendra modi parliament main khadey hone se ghabaraate hai
 i am telling you 15 minutes, make me speak there, 15 minutes make me speak in front of Modi ji, i will talk about Rafael in 15 minutes, i will talk about Nirav Modi, Modi ji will not be able to stand there
 hamane donon ke bayaan kareeb-kareeb hu-ba-hu padhe hai
 Now you see the difference
 rahul ne kaha ki rafel maamla, lalit modi or neerav modi ke maamle main modi ji 15 minute bhi nahin tik paaenge
 The Prime Minister did not say anything on this challenge of Rahul, took 15 minutes and kept his 15 minutes and his own conditions
 tivi ke liye isse acha masala kya ho saktaa he
 If you look at the statements of both of them carefully, they are going to clap
 jaise cinema main pehle front stall ke liye kuch seen hote the, ection seen aate hi tali baj jaati thi
 This is the difference you have to understand
 na to rahul gandhi apni sarkaar kii uplabdhi par 15 minute bolenge or na hi pradhanmantri neerav modi, rafel vimaan samjhauta par 15 minute
 But 15 minutes vs 15 minutes headline will be served in front of you in the media and in all the Hindi newspapers of tomorrow
 aapako bhi ipel match kii tarah khel se zyada tamaashe par mazaa aayega
 TV likewise makes you a viewer, makes the issue disappear and serves entertainment in front of you in the name of the issue
 tivi kaa charitra hi yahi he
 This used to happen earlier also, this is happening today and the same will happen tomorrow
 tivi ke sawaal aapke sawaal bana die jaaenge
 You will forget your question
 koi bhi is sawaal par bahes nahin karegaa ki pension ko lekar congress or bijepi kii kya raay he
 What kind of debate is there between them, what is the debate between the Congress and BJP about the salary of the bank employees, their working condition, what is the debate between the Congress and the BJP on the basis
 jab tak aap darshak samooh kaa hissaa hai, kisi bheed kaa hissaa hai aapako vaaki mazaa aayega ki rahul gandhi ne nahala maaraa to modi ne bhi dahala maar diya
 This happened six jaise hi aap bheed yaa samooh se alag hokar saath saal kii conso devi kii tarah alag hote hai, aap akele pad jate hai
 The system breaks you down so much that neither Congress nor BJP comes, to help you
 conso devi dur daraaj ke gaanvon main nahin rahati hai balki dilli main rahati hai
 The widow was getting pension after her husband's death but suddenly stopped
 wo teen saal ye yahi jaanane kaa prayaas kar rahi hai ki unki pension kyon band hui
 He sought information under Right to Information to find out why the pension of 1500 rupees was discontinued
 chaar saal biit gaye tab central information kamishnar ne aadesh diya ki galati conso devi kii nahin he, adhikariyon kii he
 But even after this Kanso Devi did not get pension nor was the authorities fined
 conso devi kii yah haalat kyon hui, kyonki soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat soochna dilaane kii javabdehi jin sansthaaon ko di gai he, un sansthaaon kii imaaraten to hai magar unamem ayukta nahin hai
 On 6 March, Prime Minister Modi inaugurated the five-star headquarters of the Central Information Commissioner in Munirka, South Delhi
 udghaatan ke vakt media report main is paanch manzila imaarat ko state of di art building or paryaavaran ke anukool bataaya gaya
 But in the State of the Art Building, built at a cost of 60 crores, see the state art that there should be 11 commissioners but four posts are vacant
 is saal ke ant tak chaar or ritair ho jaaenge, jinamein mukhya soochna ayukta bhi hai
 If you go to the Prime Minister's website, then there is a very beautiful thing written that only through transparency can people be given equal status
 iske baad bhi yahaan 11 ke 11 soochna ayukta nahin hai
 If the building was a little less beautiful, not even the State of the Art and there would have been 11 commissioners, a woman like Kanso Devi would not have had to travel four years to get information about her pension
 ab sochie kendriya soochna ayukta ke mukhyalay kaa yah haal he to rajyon main kya hoga
 The report of Hridayesh Joshi states that there are many states in the country where there is not a single commissioner in the information commissioner's office
 kya yah desh kii zanta ke saath mazaaq nahin he
 According to the rule, 11 information commissioners can be appointed in every state in view of population and pending cases
 andhra pradesh ko bane hue chaar saal ho gaye magar yahaan ek bhi ayukta nahin he
 Many states of Kerala and North East have only one commissioner
 himachal pradesh or jharkhand main to keval do hi soochna ayukta hai
 There are three Information Commissioners in Gujarat, Goa and Assam
 yahaan bhi 8 pad khaali hai
 There are only 4 Information Commissioners in Bihar, 7 posts are vacant here too
 soochna kaa adhikaar koi saamaanya adhikaar nahin he
 When officers do not work for the public without talking, then the public defends themselves by resorting to this law
 lekin agar rajyon se lekar dilli tak ayukta hi nahin honge to us garib janata kaa kya hoga jo pension, rashan yaa anya tarah kii sarkari madad ke liye yahaan se vahaan bhatak rahi hoti he
 35-year-old Reena is from the scheduled caste
 talakshuda hai
 Three children are together
 unhen skool bhejnaa he
 Caste certificate is required to reduce fees
 dilli ke dakshinpuri kii hai
 The revenue department has said that the father certificate of the children is also required
 ab wo kya kar rahi hai, wo siaisi gayi
 RTI applied
 do saal ho gaye, abhi tak yah nahin bataaya ki prakriya kya he
 If you ask for information under Right to Information, then you are not giving information for two years
 jab raajnneetik dal, media koi saath nahin detaa he tab isi artiai ke sahare ye saadhaaran janata apane haq kii ladaai lard rahi hoti he
 According to the report of the vigilante civic organization, more than 2 lakh appeals are pending only in the information commissions
 iske aadhaar par andaaza lagaaya gaya ki desh ke tamaam vibhaagon main 50 lakh se zyada maamle lambit ho sakate hai
 Meaning that information is not being given or there is a delay in giving it
 satark naagarik sanghathan kaa anumaan he ki bengal kii haalat yah he ki vahaan agar aap aaj artiai lagaayenge to chalis saal baad aapaki apil kaa nipataara hoga
 The comments 6 march ko jab dilli main kendriya soochna ayukta ke mukhyalay kaa udghaatan kiya gaya tha tab di print naam kii website ne ek report chhaapi thi ki do saal se ayuktaon kii niyukti nahin hui he
 In September 2016, advertisements for two posts came out but no one was appointed
 6 march ko mukhyalay ke udghaatan ke vakt pradhanmantri modi ne kaha tha ki 'system main jitani zyaada paardarshita badhati he, soochna kaa pravaah aasaan hota he, utana hi logon kaa sarkaar par bharosa badhata he
 Of course, the National Information Commission has also played an important role in this flow of information
 jab pradhanmantri bhi maanate hai ki soochna kaa pravaah aasaan hoga to logon kaa sarkaar par bharosa badhegaa phir conso devi jaisi mahila ko soochna paane main chaar saal kyon lag rahe hai
 Why the Commissioners have been vacant in the CIC headquarters for two years
 yahi nahin, media report padhenge to pradhanmantri karyaalay se artiai ke tahat jo soochna maangi jaati he usamen se badi sankhya main jawaab nahin milti he, yahi miltaa he ki jaankaree jamaa kii ja rahi he
 Rahul said that in the case of Rafael case, Lalit Modi and Nirav Modi, Modi ji will not last even 15 minutes
 pradhanmantri ne rahul kii is chunauti par kuch nahin bolaa, 15 minute ko nikaal kar apana 15 minute rakh diya or apni sharten bhi
 What can be a better seasoning for TV
 donon ke hi bayaan aap gaur se dekhenge to tali bajwane vaale hai
 Like there were some scenes in the cinema for the first front stall, clapping sounded as soon as the action scene came
 yahi antar aapako samajhnaa he
 Neither Rahul Gandhi will speak 15 minutes on the achievement of his government nor Prime Minister Nirav Modi, 15 minutes on Rafale aircraft agreement
 magar media main or kal ke tamaam hindi akhabaaron main aapke saamne 15 minute banaam 15 minute kii hedline paros di jaaegi
 You too will enjoy the spectacle more than a game like an IPL match
 tivi isi tarah se aapako darshak banaata he, mudde ko gaayab kar detaa he or mudde ke naam par aapke saamne manoranjan paros detaa he
 This is the character of TV
 yahi pehle bhi hota tha, yahi aaj bhi ho rahaa he or yahi kal bhi hoga
 TV questions will be made your questions
 aap apane sawaal bhul jaaenge
 No one will debate the question of what is the opinion of Congress and BJP about pension
 unke bich kis tarah kii bahes he, bank karmchaariyon kii selary ko lekar, unke kaam karne kii sthiti ko lokar congress or bijepi main kisi bahes he, aadhaar ko lekar congress or bijepi ke bich kya bahes he, donon kaa angel kya he
 As long as you are part of the audience group, you are part of a crowd, you will really enjoy that if Rahul Gandhi bathed, then Modi also shook
 ye hua chakka
 As soon as you are separated from the crowd or group like Sixty year old Kanso Devi, you fall alone
 system aapako is kadar tod detaa he ki na to congress aati he na bijepi aati he, aapaki madad ke liye
 Kanso Devi does not live in the remote Daraz villages but lives in Delhi
 pati kii maut ke baad vidhwaa pension mil rahi thi lekin achaanak band ho gai
 Those three years are trying to find out why his pension was discontinued
 1500 rupee kii pension kyon band hui yah jaanane ke liye unhone soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat jaankaree maangi
 Four years passed when the Central Information Commissioner ordered that the mistake was not of Kanso Devi, but of the officials
 magar iske baad bhi conso devi ko pension nahin mili or na hi adhikariyon par jurmaana laga
 Why was this condition of Kanso Devi, because the responsibility of providing information under the right to information is given to the institutions which have buildings but they do not have commissioners
 isi 6 march ko dakshin dilli ke muniraka main pradhanmantri modi ne kendriya soochna ayukta ke five starnuma mukhyalay kaa udghaatan kiya
 The media report at the inauguration described the five-story building as state-of-the-art building and environment friendly
 magar 60 karod kii laagat se bani state of di art building main state kaa art dekhie ki yahaan hone chahie 11 ayukta magar chaar pad khaali pade hai
 Four more will retire by the end of this year, including the Chief Information Commissioner
 aap pradhanmantri kii website par jaaenge to vahaan ek behad khubasurat baat likhi he ki paardarshita ke zarie hi logon ko barabari kaa darja jiya ja saktaa he
 Even after this, there are no 11 of 11 Information Commissioners
 agar yah imaarat kuch kam khubasurat bhi hoti he, state of di art nahin bhi hoti or 11 ayukta hote to conso devi jaisi mahila ko apni pension kii soochna ke liye chaar saal chakkar nahin lagane padate
 Now think what is the condition of the headquarters of the Central Information Commissioner, then what will happen in the states
 hrydayesh joshi kii report bataati he ki desh ke kai rajya aise hai jahaan soochna ayukta ke daftar main ek bhi ayukta nahin he
 Isn't this a joke with the country's life
 niyam ke anusaar aabaadi or lambit maamalon ko dekhte hue har rajya main 11 soochna ayuktaon kii niyukti kii ja sakati he
 It has been four years since Andhra Pradesh was created, but there is not a single commissioner here
 kerala or uttar purv ke kai rajyon main sirf ek hi ayukta he
 Himachal Pradesh and Jharkhand have only two Information Commissioners
 gujarat, goa or assam main teen-teen soochna ayukta hai
 Here also 8 posts are vacant
 bihar main maatr 4 soochna ayukta hai, yahaan bhi 7 pad khaali hai
 Right to information is not a general right
 adhikari jab bina baat ke janata ke kaam nahin karte hai to janata isi kanoon kaa sahaara lekar apana bachaav karti he
 But if there is no commissioner from the states to Delhi, then what will happen to the poor people who are wandering from here to there for pension, ration or other kind of government help
 35 saal kii rina anusuchit jati se hai
 Are divorced
 teen bachche saath hai
 They have to be sent to school
 fees kam ho iske liye jati pramaan patr chahie
 Belongs to Dakshinpuri of Delhi
 rajasav vibhaag ne kah diya ki bacchon ke pita kaa bhi jati pramaan patr chahie
 What are she doing now, she went to CIC
 artiai lagaai
 It's been two years, not yet told what the process is
 soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat jaankaree maangi to do saal se jaankaree nahin de rahe hai
 When the political party, the media does not support anyone, then with this RTI, these ordinary people are fighting for their right
 satark naagarik sanghathan kii report ke anusaar sirf soochna aayogon main kareeb 2 lakh se zyaada apil lambit he
 Based on this, it was estimated that more than 50 lakh cases may be pending in all the departments of the country
 matlab suchanaaen nahin di ja rahi hai yaa phir dene main deree kii ja rahi he
 The alert civic organization estimates that the condition of Bengal is that if you apply RTI there today, your appeal will be settled after forty years
 tippaniyan On 6 March, when the headquarters of the Central Information Commissioner was inaugurated in Delhi, a website called The Print published a report that commissioners have not been appointed for two years
 sitambar 2016 main do padon ke liye vigyaapan niklaa tha magar kisi kii niyukti nahin hui
 At the inauguration of the headquarters on 6 March, Prime Minister Modi said that 'the more transparency in the system, the easier the flow of information, the more the people's trust in the government increases
 nishchit taur par soochna ke is pravaah main rashtriya soochna ayog kii bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika rahi he
 When the Prime Minister also believes that the flow of information will be easy, then people's trust in the government will increase, then why is a woman like Kanso Devi taking four years to get information
 kyon do saal se siaisi ke mukhyalay main ayuktaon ke chaar chaar pad khaali hai
 Not only this, if you read the media report, a large number of answers are not received from the information sought under RTI from the Prime Minister's Office, it is found that information is being submitted
 tivi isi tarah se aapako darshak banaata he, mudde ko gaayab kar detaa he or mudde ke naam par aapke saamne manoranjan paros detaa he

 darasal, niti ayog main vishesh aamantrit sadsy pad se unki chuttee kar di gai he
 Smriti Irani was a member of NITI Aayog when she became the Minister of Human Resource Development
 unka mantralay badal jane ke baavjood bhi niti ayog main vishesh aamantrit sadsy kaa unka pad barkaraar tha
 According to the news of the Indian Express, Prakash Javadekar has been invited for the post in place of Smriti Irani
 dilachasp ye he ki prakaash jaavdekar vartmaan main maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri bhi hai
 Apart from this, Rao Inderjit Singh has been appointed as a former member of NITI Aayog
 This decision has been taken at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to meet for Governing Council meeting on 17 June
 bataa den ki beete 15 may ko hi smriti irani se soochna prasaaran mantralay waapas le liya gaya tha
 Smriti is now looking after only the Ministry of Textiles
 saansad nidhi ke durupyog ke bhi lage hai aaropahaal hi main kendriya mantrismriti iranipar saansad nidhi ke durupyog kaa aarope bhi laga he
 The serious allegations were made by Gujarat Congress President Amit Chavda
 congress vidhayak amit chaawda ne apane twit main likhaa tha, 'smriti irani ne aanand jile ke magharol gaanv ko model banane ke liye god liya tha or unhone ise bhrashtachar or satta ke durupyog kaa behtareen model banane kaa kaam kiya he
 In another tweet, Amit Chavda has also accused Smriti Irani of misusing her MP fund
 gujarat se rajyasabha saansad smriti irani par chaawda ne aarope lagaaya, 'smriti irani or unke staff ne sharada majur kaamadaar sahakaari mandali ko theka dene ke liye adhikari ko majaboor kiya
 ' sanjay lila bhansaali kii film padmavati ko lekar jahaan desh bhar main rajput samudaay kaa virodh jari he vahiin siyaasi talavaarein bhi is mudde par ghir gai hai
 All ministers, including Uma Bharti, Nitin Gadkari, have targeted Bhansali, accusing him of hurting sentiments in the name of freedom of speech, while Information Broadcasting Minister Smriti Irani came down to reply to Congress leader Shashi Tharoor's statement on Maharajas
 smriti ne kyon sindhiya-diggi kaa naam lekar gheraamaharaajaaon ke kaayar hone sambandhi shashi tharur ke bayaan par smriti irani ne jamkar palatwaar kiya
 Smriti Irani tweeted and asked- Did all the Maharajas kneel before the British? Smriti Irani sought answers from Jyotiraditya Scindia, Diggi Raja and Amarinder Singh on this comment of Shashi Tharoor
 kya kaha tha tharur ne?film 'padmavati' ko lekar mache hangaame ke bich purvakendriya mantri shashi tharur ke bayaanpar bavaal much gaya tha
 Tharoor had said - The fact is that every one of these so-called Maharajas who have lost their hands behind a filmmaker in Mumbai today had no concern about their honor when the British trampled their honor
 Were living
 ve khud ko bachaane ke liye bhaag khadey hue the
 So face this truth, so there is no question that we had collusion
 ek samaaroh main shashi tharur se sawaal kiya gaya tha ki unki kitaab 'en era of darkeness: da british empire in india' main pidaa kaa bhav kyon he jabaki unki raay yah he ki bharatiyon ne angrejon kaa saath diya tha
 To this, Tharoor said, 'it is our fault and i accept it
 sahi myne main to main pidaa ko sahi nahin tehraata hum
 i have been very strict on myself in dozens of places in the book
 kuch british samikshakon ne kaha he ki main is baat kii vyakhya kyon nahin karata ki british kaise jeet gaye? or yah behad uchit sawaal he
 The social media response to Tharoor's statement got a strong response
 rajput samaaj ke logon ne tharur ko twit kar gheraa
 Controversy over Padmavati: Congress leader Shashi Tharoor's remarks come at a time when a big controversy has arisen over the film 'padmavati' directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali
 kuch rajput sanghathanon ne bhansaali par itihaas ko tod-marod kar parosane or hindu bhaawanaaon ko bhadakaane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 However, by releasing the video, Sanjay Leela Bhansali had also given the message that he has made the film with complete sanity and there is no scene like hurting anyone's feelings
 lekin iske baavjood deshbhar main padmavati ko lekar bavaal jari he
 Here are moments from my morning exercises
 Apart from Yoga, i walk on a track inspired by the Panchtatvas or 5 elements of nature - Prithvi, Jal, Agni, Vayu, Aakash
 This is extremely refreshing and rejuvenating
 i also practice breathing exercises

 a 3-year-old child went missing in the wilderness for 2 days in North Carolina, US
 rescue kiye jane ke baad usne parents ko bataaya ki usne bhaaluu ke saath vakt bitaayaa
 Casey Hathway is currently in hospital and recovering
 vah 22 janvari ko laapata ho gaya tha
 Subsequently, a large-scale search operation was carried out
 baad main ek shaks ne soochna di thi ki baccha jangal main maa ke liye ro rahaa he
 He was then resuscitated
 laapata rahane ke dauraan kai sau log bachche kii talash kar rahe the
 Drones, helicopters and search dogs were also being used for search operations
 sabase mushkil is baat ko lekar thi ki ilaake main baari sardi pad rahi thi or barish bhi hone lagi
 After the rescue, the family told that the child is happy and talking
 sthaneey police adhikari ke saamne bhi bachche ne is baat ko doharaaya ki usne bhaaluu ke saath vakt bitaayaa he
 Authorities believe the child was wandering while missing
 laapata hone se thik pehle vah do or bacchon ke saath ghar ke peeche khel rahaa tha
 At that time he was in a coat and sweetpants and at the time of his return he was in the same clothes
 ayodhya maamle kii sunwaayee supreme court main chal rahi he or court ne baar-baar ye spasht kiya he ki yahaan aasthaa par koi vivaad nahin he
 The Muslim side says that the birthplace is two hundred steps away from where the Hindu side claims to have it
 isamen sabase mahatvapurn kadi he ees (bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan) kii report
 But neither party called the officials preparing the ASI report to the court for cross-examination
 maan len ki hindu paksh ko lagata he ki report unke daawey kii tasdik karti he or unhen ees waalon se jirah kii jarurat nahin he
 But the Muslim side also never applied for the questioning of those making the ASI report during the hearing in the High Court
 ye baat supreme court main bhi sunwaayee ke dauraan uthi or adaalat ne poocha bhi ki ees kii report taiyaar karne waalon se bahes kyon nahin hui
 But no one had the answer
 ees kii 2003 main report main hoicourt main daakhil hui thi
 Actually, the High Court had ordered the ASI to dig
 kya vahaan pehle koi mandir tha
 Did the mosque be built by breaking that temple
 isse pehle tosho international se jiyological survey karaayaa tha
 It found more than a hundred structures below ground
 iske baad ees se khudaai ke liye kaha gaya
 The ASI report states that during excavation a massive structure was found that matches North Indian temples
 muslim paksh ne report par hoicourt main sawaal uthaae or ise sirf visheshgyon kii raay bataaya
 The Muslim side says that archaeologists have different views
 lekin muslim paksh ne report taiyaar karne waalon se koi jirah nahin kii
 He may have been apprehensive that the answers to the questions would not weaken his side and this witness would not be accepted by him
 supreme court ne beete dinon muslim paksh se yahi sawaal kiya ki aapane hoicourt main visheshgyon se jirah kyon nahin kii
 The court said that asi's experts are court commissioners as they had carried out excavations on the court's order
 ees report main dhaanche ke neeche kii sanrachana wal-16 or wal 17 ko muslim paksh ne idgah kii diwaar bataaya he
 The Muslim side was earlier saying that Babur had built the mosque on the vacant land
 usne koi mandir nahin todaa
 When the ASI report came, they started calling it Idgah
 jaahir he ees report aane se pehle jameen ke neeche kii hakeekat kisi ko pataa nahin thi or ye sabhi tark baad main gadhe gaye hai
 It is to be known that when the High Court ordered the ASI to be excavated, both sides did not agree
 lekin hoicourt ke aadesh par vahaan khudaai kaaphi nishpaksh tareeke se hui thi
 The High Court had said that both Hindu and Muslim laborers would be involved in the excavation
 donon pakshon ke pratinidhi roj maujuud rahenge
 There will be a full videography of the excavation
 khudaai main mili har saamagree register main darj he or roj mili
 Shiva linga's paranala and macaparlala have been found in the excavation
 mandiron main aksar magar ke munh jaisaa banaaya jaataa he
 The Hindu side says that the Parnala with the mouth of the manger is made because Gangaji's vehicle is a manger
 ye sari chijen hindu mandiron main hoti hai
 The Muslim side says that the ASI would have given the report and said that the structure was found under the ground
 usne ye nishkarsh kyon nikaala ki sanrachana mandir se mail khaati he
 This conclusion is from ASI and the court has to decide
 baharhaal, ye saaf ho chukaa he ki ees report ko court main subut mana jayega or ye kaaphi mahatvapurn hoga

 com / b57apnoxea On 23 August 2014, there was a newspaper headline
 ‘kharch main katautee ke liye chote pratinidhimandalon ke saath pradhanmantri narendra modi kii videsh yatraaen’
 It was also said in this article, 'prime Minister Modi is keeping not only the media team but also his own delegation on his foreign tours small
 adhikariyon or mantrimandal ke sahyogiyon ko bhi in dauron se alag rakhaa ja rahaa he
 According to this report, PM Modi took a team of 42 people during his visit to Nepal
 vahiin purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke videsh dauron par kathith taur par unke saath jane vaali team main kareeb 70 sadsy shaamil rahete the, jabaki media dal isse alag hota tha
 An official was also quoted in the report as saying, 'keeping the delegation short is according to the Prime Minister's directive, which he gave to cut spending in view of the direction of Indian economy
 ’oktober 2014 main sarkaar ne paanch sitara hotalon main adhikariyon ke baithak karne par bhi roak laga di
 As part of the campaign to reduce expenses, the government also forbade air travel from business class of top bureaucrats
 mantriyon ko nae vaahan kharidne or nae pad gathit karne se manaa kar diya gaya
 Ministers were also banned from holding conferences in five-star hotels

 In this petition, apart from the expenses of renting a chartered plane on behalf of the current minister and former minister, the reason, frequency and place of travel were also asked
 sadak parivahan, rajmarg or jahajrani mantralay se jo jawaab mila, uske mutabik maujuudaamantrinitin gadakarike kaarykaal main do baar chartered vimaanon ko kiraye par liya gaya
 The first time was in May 2015 when Gadkari went to Tehran and Chabahar to sign a memorandum of understanding for the shipping ministry
 ye bhartiya vayusena kaa ambrar vimaan tha or iske istemaal ke liye mantralay ne 81,18,000 rupee kaa bhugtan kiya tha
 Gadkari first went to Tehran from Delhi and then to Chabahar from there
 vahaan se ve dilli laute
 a month later, Gadkari's ministry again hired chartered aircraft for him when he went to Bhutan with the delegation
 vahaan unhen bangladesh, bhutan or nepal ke parivahan mantriyon ke saath baithak main hissaa lenaa tha
 This time also, the Embraer aircraft of the Indian Air Force was hired for which a payment of Rs 49,81,500 was made
 gadakarinai dilli se pehle nagpur gaye or phir vahaan se paro (bhutan) gaye or dilli laute
 Incidentally, Nagpur is Gadkari's hometown
 gadakari kii donon chartered yatraaon ke kiraye ke taur par kul 1,30,99,500 rupee kharch hue
 In the same RTI, we had also asked that how many times the ministry has hired an aircraft for former minister Kamal Nath
 And its reason, date, route and cost were also asked

 pradhanmantri narendra modi or pakistani pradhanmantri navaj sharif ne guuruuvaar ko kazakhstan kii rajdhani astana main mulaakaat kii
 After this, while addressing the SCO Summit on Friday, Prime Minister Modi asked all countries to unite in the fight against terrorism

 At the same time, Pakistan, which often opposed India on the international stage, was seen to change this time
 pakistani pradhanmantri ne manch se SCO main shaamil hone par bharat ko badhai di
 However, India seemed to ignore Pakistan on this platform as well
 pakistan ke is badale rukh or summit se itar donon deshon ke netaaon ke bich khushmijaaj maahaul main mulaakaat ke baad se tamaam atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai

 It is believed that due to the strictness of China, Pakistan has shown revenge in this forum
 is summit main bharat or pakistan ko SCO kaa purnakalik sadsy banaaya gaya he
 Now the question arises whether SCO will be helpful in reducing tension and improving relations between India and Pakistan? If we look at the history, then it is clear that Pakistan talks sweetly on the international stage, but in reality it does not materialize
 aatankwaad ke masale par alag-thalag padane ke dar se pakistan ne SCO ke manch par apni chhavi sudhaarney ke liye naram hota najar aayaa he
 Apart from this, China has pressured Pakistan to be soft on the inclusion of India in the One Belt One Road project

 uttar pradesh ke gorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa upachunaav ke nattejey aaj ghoshit ho jaaenge
 This election is a battle of prestige for UP CM Yogi Adityanath as he was the same MP from Gorakhpur seat and is now the Chief Minister of the state
 vahiin duusari ore 23 saal puraani dushmani bhulaakar saath ai sapa or basapa ke liye upachunaav parinaam litmus test sabit hoga
 If you look at the political equation of the by-elections in both the seats of the state, the BJP is looking heavily at the alliance of akhilesh-mayawati
 vajah saaf he, ek to upi main yogi adityanath baari bahumat se jitkar aae hai or doosraa ye ki gorakhpur-phulpur rajya ke siem or dipti siem kii siten hai
 Phulpur: The SP-BSP combined with the BJP and the BJP, for the first time in the Modi wave, managed to win their victory in the Phulpur seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 keshav prasad maury bijepi ummidavaar ke taur par 2014 main phulpur seat se saansad bane, lekin march 2017 main upi ke dipti siem banane ke baad unhone yahaan se istipha de diya
 In view of the votes polled in the Lok Sabha elections 2014, Keshav Maurya of BJP received 5 lakh 3 thousand 564 votes out of total 9 lakh 60 thousand 341 votes
 espi ummidavaar dharm singh patel ko 1 lakh 95 hajaar 256 vot, bispi pratyaashee kapilmuni karvariyaa ko 1 lakh 63 hajaar 710 or congress ke mo
 Kaif received 58 thousand 127 votes
 bijepi ko yahaan 52 fisadi vot mili the, jabaki espi or bispi kaa vot fisadi 47 rahaa
 In such a situation, not only the SP-BSP but all the votes cast in the protest were mixed even then they were less than the votes BJP got
 isi record ko dekhte hue kaha ja saktaa he ki agar 2014 jaise vot pade to sapa ummidavaar nagendra patel bispi ke samarthan ke baad bhi jeet ke prati aashwast nahin rah sakate
 Gorakhpur: BJP, more than SP, BSP, is considered a strong fort of BJP
 1989 se ye seat bijepi ke paas he
 Yogi Adityanath resigned from the Lok Sabha Lok Sabha constituency after becoming MP of UP last year after being an MP for the last five times
 gorakhpur seat ko bijepi se chhinane ke liye sapa or basapa ne haath milaayaa he
 Despite this, it will not be easy for the opposition
 bataa den ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main yogi adityanath ko 5 lakh 39 hajaar 127 vot mili the
 SP candidate Rajmati Nishad got 2 lakh 26 thousand 344 votes, while BSP candidate Ram Bhuial Nishad got 1 lakh 76 thousand 412 votes
 iske alaava congress ko mahaj 45 hajaar 719 vot mili
 In this way, along with SP and BSP, the Congress vote is 4 lakh 48 thousand 475 votes
 jo ki bijepi se 90 hajaar 652 vot kam hai
 BSP has supported SP candidate Praveen Nishad to beat BJP candidate Upendra Shukla from Yogi's Legacy seat from Gorakhpur seat
 ab dekhnaa he ki yogi ko mili pichley vot kii bharpai sapa basapa milakar kaise karte hai

 Sania told the media after the match that i tried hard to win but luck was not with me today
 besaline se lambii reliyon ke gavaah rahe is match ke pehle set main donon khilaadiyon ne ek duusare kii sarvice todakar ank batorne se shuruyaat kii, paanchaven game tak yah silsilaa chalata rahaa lekin rodeonova ne chathe game main aasaani se apni sarvice bachaakar 4-2 kii badhat hasil kar lee
 The game proved decisive for world number 62 and top seed Rodianova here as Sania, ranked 137 at WTA rankings, could not save her serve even once in this set
 unhone pehle game main hi do dabl phalt karke aasaani se austrailian khilaadi ko ank diye
 The Indian tennis star managed to take break points in the second, fourth and eighth games on the strength of her strong side, but Rodionova again took advantage of the mistakes made on Sania's serve in the ninth game and set it up in half an hour
 semifinal main bhi austrailian oliga rogovska ke khilaaf pehla set aasaani se ganvaane ke baad vaapasi karne vaali sania duusare set ke duusare game main phir se sarvice ganvaane kii sthiti main pahunch gayi thi lekin tab unhone na sirf brake point bachaakar lagaataar do ank ke saath game apane naam kiya balki tisare game main rodianova kii sarvice bhi todi
 Rodianova could not control her backhand which went out
 sania ne chauthe or chathe game main bhi apni sarvice par 30-40 se vaapasi karte hue apni badhat barkaraar rakhi or phir agle game main kuch karaare shaat kaa acha namoona pesh karke brake point ke duusare maukey ko bhunaakar apni badhat 5-2 kar di
 Sania started the decisive set in a spectacular manner and took advantage of her opponent's two double faults to take a break point in the first game but could not control her serve in the fourth game and sixth game and Rodianova scored 4-2 Acquired the edge
 ‘kam aan sania’ kii gunj ke bich bhartiya star ne vaapasi kii koshish karke agle game main brake point se score 3-4 kiya lekin aage phir se puraani kahani dohraayi gayi
 In the eighth game, Sania again failed to save her serve and thus gave Rodianova a chance to serve for the gold medal
 sania ne is game main match point bachaaya or phir brake point or uske baad sarvice ank lekar 5-5 ke score se niraashaa ko aashaa main badal diya
 He saved three match points when Sania was serving 5-6, and eventually extended the set to a tiebreaker by naming an 'S' to the long-standing game on the deuce
 tibraker main sania shuru se hi pichad gayi
 He made some unsuccessful attempts to return but again submerged him with a double fault
 supreme court ne shaq jaahir kiya he ki police or narcotic control beuro ke log jabt kii gai karodon rupee kiye gaehashish or ganjeco nasht nahin karte
 Rather, due to system flaws, heavy buyers leave the market with profits
 court ne centre or rajya sarkaron kii khinchaai bhi kii he
 The court has feared that cow dung manure is burnt instead of drugs
 niyamon ke mutabik police yaa narcotic control beuro ke adhikariyon ko jabt kii hui drugs jalaakar nasht kerani hoti hai
 The court asked, where are the drugs, a bench of Drugs Justices TS Thakur and NV Raman asked Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar that Narcotics Bureau says we have seized drugs worth Rs 30 crore, drugs worth Rs 50 crore
 aakhir ye jaati kahaan he? court main to sample laayaa jaataa he,baaki kahaan ja rahi he?kya aap sunishchit hai ki jo cheez jalaai ja rahi he vah drugs hi he yaa phir yah gaay ke gobar kii khaad he? sambhav he ki yah khaad hi ho
 It is here in the system that Khamikort said that the seized drugs are given to destroy the constable or junior level people
 ve jaanate hai ki saboot ke taur par sample ke liye thodi hi chahie
 They can easily sell the rest
 aise maamle saamne bhi aae hai
 The policy court asked for a week has asked Ranjit Kumar to make a drugs disposal policy within a week
 saath hi rajyon ke sachivon se beete 10 saal kaa record maanga he ki vibhinn kanoon lagu karne ke liye kya kadam uthaae
 What is the matter? Actually, the Supreme Court is hearing the 2012 appeal of the Center
 centre ne punjab or haryana hai court kii ore se kuch logon ko bari kiye jane ke khilaaf yah yachika daayar kii thi
 The court expressed suspicion on Amicus curiae Ajit Kumar stating that only 5 to 10 percent of the drugs seized are destroyed
 agar aapair indiyaki flite se kahin ja rahe hai to aapako jald hi payalat kii anounsament hindi main sunne ko mil sakati he
 According to sources, Air India has told its pilots that if they make an announcement in Hindi on the flight, they will be rewarded
 yatriyon kaa saamaan khone main ye airlines number-1abhi tak payalat aam taur par english main hi anounsament karte hai
 But according to sources, it was decided in a meeting between Air India officials and the Ministry of Civil Aviation that the pilots would now be encouraged by rewarding them for announcing in Hindi
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki iske liye flite report main payalton kii anounsaments ke records bhi shaamil kiye jaaenge, jisase yah pataa chalegaa ki vaaki payalat aisa kar rahe hai yaa nahin
 If the insistence of Air India, video viral experts say, this step will not help Air India, which is heavily debt-ridden
 haalanki safar karne vaale hindi bhashi logon ko jarur thodi suvidha ho jaaegi
 The Prime Minister's Office had last month sought a detailed report from the Ministry of Aviation on the economic status of Air India

 apana naam sunanaa kisko pasand nahin hota he? hamaari pahchaan hamaare naam se hi hoti he
 The name sets us apart from others in a crowd of people
 lekin agar koi vyakti aapse baat karte samay aapkaa naam baar-baar letaa he to yah bas yun hi nahin he
 Rather, there can be many reasons behind this
 aaie jaane
 
 
 - If someone calls your name repeatedly, it means that you are very special in that person's life
 aapako special mahasoos karaane ke liye bhi aksar log baatcheet ke dauraan naam lete hai
 Due to these reasons, the trend of staying single is increasing among women - one reason behind taking names again and again is that the people you are talking to want you to listen to them carefully
 kyonki aapke baat karne ke tareeke se log samaj jate hai ki aapkaa dhyaan unke bajaay duusari chizon par zyada he
 Therefore, people often take your name to draw your attention
 - yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki jab kisi topic par baat karte samay koi vyakti aapkaa naam letaa he to baatcheet kaa wo topic aapako hameshaa yaad rahata he
 Do you not say these things to your partner while quarreling? - If someone takes your name repeatedly while talking to you, then it clearly shows that the person wants your attention towards him
 saath hi baatcheet ko zyada interactive banane ke liye bhi kuch log aapkaa naam lete hai
 - When someone takes your name, it also shows how well they know you
 ilke alaava us vyakti ke chehre ke bhav or uske bolne ke tareeke se aap yah pataa laga sakate hai ki aapaki baatcheet kaa ant acha hoga yaa phir ye aapkaa din kharaab karne ke liye kaaphi he
 Amidst Shiv Sena introducing Aditya Thackeray as Chief Minister, Union Minister and RPI (A) chief Ramdas Athawale on Saturday termed the young leader as a novice in Maharashtra's politics and did not consider it right for the post
 athavle ne suzav diya ki bhavishya main agar avasar mili to shivasena adhyaksh evam aditya ke pita uddhav thakare is sheersh pad ke bare main sochen
 The union minister made the remark after Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari invited the BJP along with its other allies to form the government in Maharashtra

 Talking to reporters after the meeting, Athawale requested the Shiv Sena not to force the BJP to distribute the chief minister's post for two-and-a-half years
 athavle ne kaha ki sheersh pad ko lekar shivasena or bhaajapa ke bich takaraav ke kaaran sarkaar gathan main deree ho rahi he
 He said that farmers are in crisis due to unseasonal rains in various parts of the state
 unhone kaha, ‘‘agar shivasena congress yaa rakanpa ke saath haath milaati he to yah galat hoga
 According to the rule, the governor has the right to invite the largest party to form the government
 ''mantri ne kaha, ‘‘unhone (rajyapal ne) yah bhi kaha ki ise (sarkaar gathan) jald kiya jaye
 He said that if he does not get a clear majority proposal then he will exercise his authority
 '' athavle ne kaha ki maharashtra main congress or rakanpa ke 15 saal ke shashan ke dauraan mukhyamantri pad us party ko jaataa tha jo adhik se adhik siten jitati thi
 Athawale said that in Haryana too, the Chief Minister's post is with the bjp's Manohar Lal Khattar government, while Dushyant Chautala of Jananayak Janata Party (JJP), who won some seats, has become his deputy chief minister
 unhone kaha, ‘‘dhai-dhai saal kaa yah prayog (mukhyamantri pad saajha karne kaa) desh main nahin hua he
 So, i think the Shiv Sena should not make such a demand
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘meraa suzav he ki bhavishya main uddhav ji ko mukhyamantri banane ke bare main sochna chahie
 Aditya is there, but he doesn't have that much experience right now
 unhone sawaal kiya ki agar aditya ko mukhyamantri banaaya jaataa he to rajya kaise chalegaa

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne beete dinon rajdhani main mahilaon ke liye badi saugat kaa elaan kiya
 He promised that women in Delhi would not have to pay a single penny to travel in the metro and bus
 lekin centre sarkaar ko lagata he ki aisa sambhav nahin he
 Union Minister Hardeep Puri said on Thursday that it does not seem possible to implement such a scheme
 hardip puri bole ki arvind kejariwal ke paas kisi tarah kaa plan nahin he
 This scheme is just a kind of jumla

 We are constantly talking to the DMRC

 According to him, it will cost about Rs 800 crore, which will be borne by the Delhi government from his pocket

 The condition of some people is so bad that they are shocked by the defeat in the elections

 These hundred days were of certainty, commitment and good intentions
 unhone kaha ki pichley sau dinon main jo bhi bade nirnay kiye gaye unke peeche prerana 130 karod bharatiyon kii rahi
 Due to your unprecedented cooperation, the government was able to take major decisions from the agricultural sector to national security
 piem modi ne chandrayaan-2 mishan kaa bhi zikr karte hue kaha ki puure desh main ‘isro kii bhaavana' he or ab log safalataa-asafalataa se upar uthakar sochane lage hai
 Recalling the events of late Friday night, when Chandrayan-2 lander Vikram was to land on moon land, the Prime Minister said that at one o'clock in the night, the whole country sat in front of TV for the success of Chandrayaan-2 mission
 Was waiting for news
 piem modi ne kaha, ‘‘un 100 second main desh ne jo bhi kiya vah 125 karod bharatiyon kii prakruti ko dikhaata he
 
 
 The country changed the definition of success and failure in those 100 seconds
 '' pradhanmantri ne kaha ki haal ke maheene main kai mahatvapurn kanoon paas kiye gaye jisamen aatankwaad se nipatna or muslim mahilaon ke adhikaron kii raksha karnaa shaamil he
 He said a roadmap has been prepared to help various sectors aimed at strengthening the economy and referred to "historic decisions" taken to strengthen the banking sector
 unhone kaha, ‘‘yah keval shuruyaat he or iske laabh aagaamee dinon main mahasoos kiye jaaenge

 If you are trying to lose weight, be careful, because you still cannot escape the charge of being fat
 kam se kam tab tak, jab tak anya mahilaon (se tulana) kii baat saamne aati he
 Researchers in the UK found during the study that women looked down upon a girl who had won the curvy body competition, because she was worried about the competition she could now offer
 daily mail kii khabar ke mutabik haalanki purushon ko us mahila main zyada dilchaspee hoti he, jiske bare main yadi use pataa chalata he ki vah kabhi motopa kii samasya se grast thi
 It is probably because they think that there is a possibility of denting with him
 unase aasaani se sampark saadhaa ja saktaa he
 Researchers said that the fierce competition for women to lose weight and look beautiful means that they often look for reasons to dislike others
 rain international skool ke saat varshiya chaatr pradhyumna thakur kii hatya kii khabar aane ke kuch ghante bheetar hi gurugram police kaa bayaan aayaa ki usne maamla sulajhaa liya he or skool ke bas conductor ashok kumaar ko pakad liya he jo hatyara he
 The police claimed that Kumar had "accepted" that he killed Pradyuman
 unhone yah daawa bhi kiya ki uski nishandehi par ve hatya ke hathiyaar tak pahunch gaye hai yani kanoonee bhashaa main kahen to kumaar ke ''bayaan" ke aadhaar par katl main istemaal kiye gaye hathiyaar kii ''baramadagi" kii gai
 In most cases of this type, it happens that after the killer is caught, the media's interest in the case ends
 ashok kumaar kii giraftaar ke baad bhi yahi hona chahie tha
 In such a case, his bail should have been dismissed, because in such serious cases, bail is not granted until the convict is able to establish that there was no relationship between the crime and that — the reverse
 It was because it was impossible because of Kumar's "confessional statement"
 iske baad yah hota ki uskaa parivaar shuruaati ek saal main use jamaanat dilwane ke liye kisi mahange vakil par apane saare sansaadhan phoonk detaa
 Then maybe two, three or four years after his arrest, by the time he got his first chance to challenge the plaintiff in court, by then all his resources would have gone to the private lawyer and he had no other way but cheap government lawyer Would have stayed phir use is vakil kii madad se is dharna ko chunauti deni hoti ki hatyara vahi he, chunki usee ne police ko hatya ke hathiyaar tak pahunchaaya tha
 This is because courts usually adjudicate on the basis of similar evidence
 bhartiya kanoon main police ke saamne diya gaya kubulanamaa sakshya nahin mana jaataa, phir bhi yah sab kuch isi tarah hota
 Kumar was lucky that nothing like this happened
 pradhyumna ke mata-pita police kii ore se pesh tark ko sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar nahin hue
 He also had the resources to go up to the Supreme Court
 utani hi ahm yah baat bhi rahi ki us skool ke duusare abhibhavakon ne pradhyumna ke mata-pita kaa saath diya
 There were demonstrations outside the school
 pados ke ek sharaab ke theke ko phoonk diya gaya
 Seeing increasing pressure, the state government handed over the case to CBI
 sibiai ne kumaar ko clin chit de di or skool main hi padhgaye vaale ek kishor chaatr ko katl kaa doshi tehraaya
 Qubnamnama is a dangerous thing because it reinforces the innate belief that why would someone accept a crime if he has not done it
 is dharna ke peeche darasal police kii jaanch prakriya or duusare pahaluon se sambandhit agyanta kii bhoomika hoti he
 People do not know how the police accept
 duniya bhar main aaj jhuthe kubulaname ke pratikul prabhaavon par adhyayan ho rahe hai

 Rahul Gandhi, who made his debut in politics in 2004, became Congress President before the end of 2017
 13 saal main kareeb 10 saal unki party kii centre main sarkaar rahi
 But just before becoming the party president, Rahul had never seen the kind of political attitude
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main rahul kii ore se party ke prachaar ko jis tarah dhar di gai, use dekhakar raajnneetik sameekshak bhi kehane lage- ‘badale badale se najar aa rahe hai rahul'
 In view of the manner in which Congress won 80 seats with allies in the Gujarat elections, opponents were also forced to take Rahul seriously
 gujarat main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan hi rahul ne khud ko shivbhakt or janeudhari brahman batakarrajnneeti kii apni dishaaka sanket bhi diya
 Rahul took over the reins of the Congress as president almost a week before the Gujarat results
 gujarat main beshak congress sarkaar banane laayak sthiti main nahin pahunch saki lekin bijepi ko 99 siton par hi roak dene ne hi congress kaaryakartaaon ke liye sanjivani se kam kaam nahin kiya
 Rahul knows that if the Congress is to be strengthened and the party workers are to be encouraged, then it is very important to keep in touch with them
 party ke bheetar congress kaaryakartaaon ko kareeb laane ke liye rahul ko suzav diya gaya ki bataur adhyaksh wo party daftar main baithen or bina samay lekar aae kaaryakartaaon se bhi rou-ba-rou hon
 This will motivate the workers to work twice as enthusiastically
 isse pehle indira gandhi or rajeev bhi isi tarah janata darbar lagaaya karte the
 Sonia Gandhi also did this initially after becoming party president
 haalanki, 2004 main upie sarkaar banane ke baad suraksha or taam jhaam ke chalate congress mukhyalay main sonia kaa kaarykram band ho gaya or ’10 janpath’ main hi darbar lagane laga
 In such a situation, Rahul is going to start the old tradition in the Congress headquarters again soon
 rahul ne is prastaav ko sahmati de di he ki, jab wo dilli main rahenge to mangalvaar or shuukravaar ko party mukhyalay aakar daftar main hi samay maangane vaale netaaon se mila karenge
 At the same time, on Saturday, Rahul will meet the workers and common people from far and wide in the lawn of the party headquarters
 isse pehle rahul ahm siyaasi maukon par hi congress mukhyalay aate the
 Otherwise, they used to deal with political work in their own house '12 Tughlaq Lane 'or the Congress' war room '15 Gurdwara Rakabganj'
 lekin bataur party adhyaksh '24 akbar road’ main mulaakaat ke is kaarykram se party sanghathan ke un netaaon ko bhi sandesh jayega jo gaahe-bagaahe hi mukhyalay aayaa karte hai
 If Rahul himself comes to the headquarters often, then the rest of the leaders are also obliged
 saath hi party kaaryakartaaon or aam logon kii pahunch bhi netaaon tak aasaan ho jaaegi
 On this new exercise of Rahul, party spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi says that, as President Rahul Gandhi works in his office, meets the common people and workers, we should all welcome it, this is a welcome step
 aaj ke siyaasi halaat ke maddenjar bataur congress adhyaksh rahul ke saamne chunauti badi he, jisase nipatane ke liye janata se pehle apni party ke netaaon or kaaryakartaaon kaa dil jeetne hoga
 This is the latest step of Rahul in this effort, whose success and failure will be decided in the coming elections

 ) congress party ne qareeb 28 varshon ke baad ravivaar ko patna ke gandhi maidan main ek raily kaa aayojan kiya ha
 While Congress President Rahul Gandhi will be present in this rally, it is expected that he will also answer the last interim budget passed on Friday in his address
 is raily kii khaas baat yah rahegi ki isamen bihar main mahagathbandhan ke sabhi sahyogiyon ko aamantrit kiya gaya he
 Be it rjd's Tejashwi Yadav, rlsp's Upendra Kushwaha or former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi
 saath hi viipi party ke mukesh nishad, vampanthi dalon ke sthaneey netaa, bihar congress ne sabko aamantrit kiya he
 Tejashwi Yadav is in Delhi these days, he will probably come along with Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Sunday
 yah pehali baar he ki congress kii raily main unke sahyogi dalon ke netaa mukhya vaktaa ke rup main bhaashan denge
 Though there is doubt that the Congress party will be able to mobilize against the big rallies at Patna's Gandhi Maidan, but the organizers claim that they aim to bring at least two and a half lakh people to Gandhi Maidan
 yahi kaaran he ki party ne nirdaleey vidhayak anant singh se sahaayta lene main koi parhez nahin kiya he
 On Saturday, Rajya Sabha MP and former Union Minister Akhilesh Singh admitted that while Anant Singh is active in making this rally a success, since he is not yet formally a member of the party, he will not be present on the stage

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has given another big weapon before the general elections
 rahul ne desh ke 20 fisadi garibon ko nunatam aay kii guarantee dene vaale ek badi yojana kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Under this, about 5 crore families will be guaranteed a new income of Rs 72,000 every year
 congress ne is yojana kaa zyada vivaran nahin diya he, isliye is par jaankaar abhi zyada kuch nahin bol rahe, lekin anumaan he ki agar ise lagu kiya gaya to isse sarkari khajaane par har saal 3
 6 lakh crore rupees
 rahul gandhi ne bataaya ki desh se garibi dur karne ko lakshya rakhkar laai gai is yojana ke tahat har saal desh ke 20 fisadi atyant garib logon ko maheene main kam se kam 12 hajaar rupee aay milanaa sunishchit kiya jayega
 He said that Narendra Modi can give money to the rich people of the country, so why can't the Congress party give 72,000 rupees to the poorest of the poor
 congress ne is yojana ko NYAY (nunatam aay yojana) naam diya he
 Rahul Gandhi said that this plan is ready and it is fully feasible financially
 iske tahat paanch karod pariwaron yaa 25 karod logon ko yojana kaa laabh milegaa
 Rahul said, 'we will remove poverty from the country
 ‘ is idia ko jabardast bataate hue rahul gandhi ne kaha ki jo log 12 hajaar rupee se kam kamaate hai, ham sunishchit karenge ki unki aay 12 hajaar rupee maheene tak pahunche
 Even more than Narendra Modi's total scheme, giving Rs 72,000 per year to 5 crore families annually means that this would give about 3 to the exchequer
 6 lakh karod rupee kaa boj padegaa
 This is about 13 percent of the total budget of Rs 27,84,200 crore fixed for the next financial year i
e
 2019-20
 yahi nahin, yah 2019-20 ke bajet main narendra modi sarkaar dwaara centre pryojit yojanaon jaise manaregaa, svachh bharat abhiyaan, neshnal health mishan, rashtriya sakshartaa abhiyaan aadi ke liye kul prastaavit 3
 27 lakh crore will be more than the budget
 yah bharat ke kul jidipi kaa kareeb 2 fisadi hissaa hoga
 This means that India will either lag behind on the path of financial discipline or it will have to drastically cut the resources of other welfare schemes
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki congress sarkaar satta main ai to yah yojana kai charnon main lagu kii jaaegi
 Rahul said that the Congress has studied the financial implications of the scheme and has consulted the country's leading economists and experts in several rounds for 4-5 months before finalizing it
 rahul ne kaha ki mahatma gandhi gramin rojgaar yojana se desh main 14 karod logon ko garibi ke dushchakr se baahar rakhane main madad mili he
 And the justice plan that Congress has announced today will be the second attempt to eradicate poverty
 duniya kii sabase badi kalyankari yojanavaise yah yojana lagu tab hogi jab congress satta main aati he
 But in fact if the Congress came to power and implemented it then it could prove to be the biggest welfare scheme in the world
 25 karod kii jansankhya kaa matlab he puure ek indonesia jaise desh ke baraabar
 Never before has a universal basic income or minimum income guarantee scheme been implemented on such a large scale anywhere in the world

 Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray is no different in this case
 16 july kii subah jab seene main dard ke chalate bete uddhav thakare ko bandra (pashchim) sthit mumbai ke leelavati hospital main bhartee karaayaa gaya to shivasena pramukh ne sabase pehle apane naaraaz bhattije or maharashtra navnirmaan sena (manase) adhyaksh raaj thakare ko phone kiya
 According to information from India Today, Army Chief Thackeray told Raj with a full hug, "uddhav has been admitted to Lilavati
 uski dekhbhaal ke liye vahaan koi bada vyakti nahin he
 You go there main tumhen phir se saath dekhnaa chahta hum
 The MNS chief was then going to Alibaug, 70 km from Mumbai, to attend a training camp for party councilors
 raaj waapas mude or patni sharmila tathaa maa kunda ke saath dadu (bade bhai), kii dekhbhaal ke liye aspataal kii taraf chal pade
 His move aroused a desire for reconciliation among MNS and Shiv Sena workers
 raaj ne hospital ke cameraa number 604 kaa darwaja kholaa to uddhav ne apane haath badha die
 He asked, "how are you?" Raj replied smilingly, "I am fine
" aap jaldi achche ho jaaie
 "this was their first conversation in three and a half years
 kadavaahat ke daur main unhone ek-duusare par hamalaa karne kaa koi mauka nahin ganvaaya
 Raj then accompanied Uddhav to the cath lab, where angiography revealed that Uddhav had blockage in three arteries
 doctoron ne unhen bypass surgery karaane kii salaah di
 Although he was discharged the same day, Uddhav may again be admitted to the hospital for further treatment
 aspataal ke ek sutara ne bataaya, ''udhaas or pareshaan uddhav ke liye raaj takat kaa strot rahe
 Later, Uddhav and his wife Rashmi were seated in their black Mercedes e-class car and brought to their home in Raj Bandra (east), Matoshree
 donon chachere bhaaiyon kaa bhavy swaagat kiya gaya
 Raj discussed Uddhav's future treatment with the family and left for Alibaug to attend the camp after drinking coffee
 uddhav kii beemaari kii khabar jangal main aag kii tarah fail gai
 The first to reach him were MNS mlas Praveen Darekar and Vasant Geete
 haalanki sab jaanate hai ki uddhav manase kaaryakartaaon se milanaa pasand nahin karte lekin us roj unhone unase baat kii
 According to a source, Uddhav told him, "I will get well soon and we will fight each other again
" '' phir thodaa rukkar ve bole, ''aisa kab tak chalegaa? kya ham saath nahin aaenge?'' yah sunakar manase vidhayak bhavuk ho gaye
 a senior MNS MLA feels that Uddhav's illness may be the "long-desired" turning point in state politics
 unhone kaha, ''rajnatik matbhedon ne unhen alag kiya lekin uddhav kii beemaari unhen kareeb le ai he
 We have a better relationship with both
 yadi ve phir se ek hote hai to hamen khushi hogi
 In March this year, MNS leader Bala Nandgaonkar had said in the assembly that if the Shiv Sena and MNS were together, the congress-nationalist Congress Party alliance would not have won the assembly elections
 shivasena ke sanjay raut adhik satark najar aae
 He said, "there should be no political implication
" khun ke rishte hameshaa raajnneeti se gadhe hote hai
 The idea of reconciliation first gained strength when Bal Thackeray said in February that the doors of his house were still open to Raj
 raaj ne bhi ek vaade ke saath haath milaane kii ichha jaahir kii
 He made the announcement a few days later at a gathering in Worli
 ''yadi aap ek kadam aage badhenge to main 100 kadam aage badhoonga
 "bal Thackeray has stepped up

 It has been printed by Rajkamal Prakashan as 'raag Pahadi'
 'raag pahari' kaa deshkal, katha-sansar unnisvin sadi ke madhya se lekar beesvin sadi se pehle kaa kumaun he
 The story begins with the image of six mysterious women circling the rhythm dressed in red-black clothes, which foreshadow a terrible misfortune
 in pretatmaon ne yah tay kar rakhaa he ki vah nainital ke pavitra taal ko firangi angrejon ke pradooshan se mukt karaane kii chetavanee de rahi hai
 In this Nainital, a child named orphan Tilottama Upreti is growing up
 tilottama ke chachaa ko 1857 vaali azaadi kii ladaai main ek baagi ke rup main phaansi par lataka diya gaya tha
 The plot of 'raag Pahadi' revolves around other members of Tilottama's family, as well as foreign characters, including American painter William Dampster who has gone to explore India
 tilottama gavaah he us badlaav kii jo kabhi dabe paanv to kabhi achaanak naatakeey dhang se almoda samet durgam qasbon, chhavniyon or bastiyon ko badal rahaa he
 This change is affecting the whole of India in a way
 is upanyaas main parampara or aadhuniktaa kaa takaraav or isse prabhavit kabhi laachaar, to kabhi karmath paatro kii jidagiyon kaa chithran bahut marmasparshi dhang se kiya gaya he
 The special thing is that its form and sound is like the vocals of 'raag Pahari'
 chitrakaari ke rang or sangeet ke swar ek adbhut sansar kii rachana karte hai jahaan myth-puranic, aitihaasik-vaastavik or kaalpanik tathaa fantasy main antar karnaa asambhav ho jaataa he
 That is why Vani Tripathi Tikku described it as 'mountain's tapestry'
 'raag pahari' kii kahani he shaashvat prem kii, milan or vichoh kii, adamya jijeevishaa kii
 For the readers of Sahitya Aaj Tak, the book excerpt of 'raag Pahadi' courtesy of publisher Rajkamal Prakashan xxrep 7 * The District Commissioner of Nainital and the English people were not getting any rhyme which was in the advertisement of Anand Anardana Churna Was printed shahar kii teen sambhraant mahilaon, jinamein ireland kii shrimati candal, german madaam secle or shrimati herrece thim, ne secle main ek baithak kii
 He decided that the matter should be taken seriously and the men should take some step
 yah harakat vahiyaat he, behuda bhi or ashobhaneey jise bardaasht nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Mrs
 Hares whispers in her quarrelsome figure, "A picture of an English woman and that too on a vial of lousy Hindustani medicine, on which there are so many dirty and dirty hands
" or upar se vah abhadra gaanaa bikri badhaane ke liye hamaari nijee bimariyon kaa makhul udaata hua
 "the Pahari song that was being mentioned sounded pleasant in Pahari dialect and it changed badly in English translation
 par gore bhadra log jitna bhi samaj paae vahi unki naaraazgi kaa sabab ban gaya
 Jeevan Chandra Pant had been a Shahi Vaidya and knew to cool the rage of the rulers
 unhone brahman sulabh chaturaai ke saath sankat kaa samaadhaan found nikaala
 He wrote an apology in figurative Hindi which was printed in beautiful paper in beautiful script
 phir uski anek pratilipiyon ko maanviya district kamishnar mahoday or sammanit mahilaon ke bich vitarit kiya gaya
 The letter was accompanied by a short note written in English: Subject Regretful Explanation of Misunderstanding Regarding Relating to Herbal Cures
 patr ko padhane-samajhane or uskaa motamoti anuwaad karne main munsif ko do din lag gaye
 The women had no such official means, they gave their cooks the job of translation but they could not read or write poor thing
 aakhirkaar us daakiye ko talab kiya gaya jo khat likh-pard saktaa tha
 When the letter was distributed, i could not stop my laughter
 vaidya ne bade vistaar se or bade aadambarpurn tareeke se maafee maangane kaa dikhaava kiya tha, jahaan baar-baar yah baat doharaai gai thi ki bhagavaanon jaisi bartaanvi nasl ke prati uske hriday main kitne aadar kaa bhav tha
 This thing became like a storm in a cup of tea
 jivan chandra ji ko is baat kaa afsos tha ki unke khayr-khwaah tyler sahab kaa tabadalaa ho gaya tha jo is samay madadgaar ho sakate the
 On the label of Anand Anardane vials, the picture of an English woman like Devi was still sticking and the local people used to buy them in large quantities to get rid of air disorders
 jab is vyapaar kaa uttaradhikari muktesh almoda ke ghar ke aangan main unmukt ho khel rahaa hota tab uske pita or chachere bhai paisa kamaane or sampatti jutaney main vyast rahete
 a new way of increasing business came to Jayesh's mind
 usne yah khoj kii thi ki chuuran main kitni chamatkaari shaktiyaan thim
 He planned to publish an illustrated booklet describing them
 vah apni angrezi sudhaarney ke praytn ke saath-saath hindustani shabdon se bhi bane is ishtahaar ko aakarshak samajhataa tha
 Anardana, a treatment for every merge
 jise kaam laaen angrezi memen
 Who understands it better than medicines coming from the seven sea level
 iske saath ek chitra tha dard main karavatein badalati ek mahila kaa
 She would be seen again as soon as the emerald turned up, but this time after smiling got rid of the pain
 inamen se kuch chitra us style main bane the jo ganga dashahra ke parv par yaa harele ke avasar par darwaazon kii sajaavat ke liye kaam laae jate the
 It was difficult for artists drawing images of gods and goddesses to depict the rise, tightness, and erosion of the body of villous memes
 unhen in praaniyon ko paas se dekhne kaa mauqaa kabhi miltaa hi nahin tha
 As a result, in these pictures, the breast of the memes looked like the triangular peaks of the Himalayas
 agle ek chitra main ek vidwaan pandit apni brahman tond par mutthi kase chitrit the
 The pain on his face was palpable
 chotii khuli thi or bal peeth par bikhare
 The peak in the next picture was again tied up
 haath namaskara main jude the
 It was written below, 'I am grateful to you for this miraculous medicine
 ’ itnaa hi nahin tha, ek lambi fehrist thi un logon kii jinhone yah pramanit kiya tha ki yah aushadhi kitni laabhadaayak he
 Many of the people whose names were printed were based on the names of Jayesh's friend circle
 almoda main ek badlaav aa rahaa tha jise sirf mahasoos kiya ja saktaa tha
 By the way, people, things, buildings and clothes looked the same as before, but something was changing
 koi yah nahin dekh paa rahaa tha kyonki logon ne dekhne kii aadat chhod di thi or badlaav kii gati itani dhimi thi ki vah lagbhag adrishy tha
 But Kaumudi, who had been out of Almora for a long time and was a silent spectator by nature, could hear the footsteps of the coming change
 vah un chizon ko dekh sakati thi jo auron kii aankhon se ojhal thim
 First of all, there were books that people were reading
 charles darwin kii 'on di orijan of spasis’ vaidya ji ke ghar main garmagaram bahes ko janm de rahi thi
 Jayesh used to read this book diligently, and after returning from Nainital, he kept talking to his uncle for a long time on this subject
 uski ankhen uttejnaa se aise chamakatin jaise koi rahasy usne chupa rakhaa ho
 But how could Kaumudi's husband, an eminent Ayurvedic physician, agree with Darwin's ideas? He used to say that "you tell us that we are the children of Brahmin monkeys, whereas we have not known how many ages ago, they have descended from the Saptarishis
" vahi hamaare purakhe hai or tum maanate ho ki hamaare dada-pardada bandar the
 Vaidya looked out of the window
 unka ladkaa muktesh baahar khel rahaa tha
 He was swinging by holding the apple tree, he said, "and you want to say that my boy belongs to the Vanar caste, a descendant of Hanuman and Sugriva
" ’’kaumudi ko apane bhattije kii baaten dilachasp bhi lag rahi thim or aakarshak bhi
 She came forward to rescue him
 usne zaraa hichkichaate hue kaha, ''hanuman banar hi nahin the ek devtaa bhi the
 What is wrong with being a descendant of Hanuman? ”her husband was not accustomed to hearing this voice of his wife
 unhone kaha kuch nahin, bas zaraa sakht nigaah se uski taraf dekha
 It was not that only men were reading strange books and behaving strangely
 tilottama bhi aashcharya or anand se bhari ek nai duniya se parichit ho rahi thi
 She had reached the threshold of the new century, and she read newspapers and news in newspapers
 sthaneey samachar-patr 'almoda akhbaar’ kaa niyamit parayan karti thi
 The books he brought from the local library and from the English bookstore had introduced him to the change that was happening in the country and the world
 usne badi hasarat se sochaa, 'kitna kuch he duniya main khojane ke liye, dekhne-sunne or anubhav karne ke liye par yah sab mere liye nahin!’dharm bhi badal rahaa tha
 Swami Vivekananda, a Bengali sage wearing a long-standing English-speaking and cigar-drinking gerua cloak and a turban, arrived in Almora
 vah swami ramakrishna ke shishy the or 'okale house’ ke maalik laal hari shah ke yahan padharkar unhone use krutharth kiya tha
 Women were also allowed to listen to Swami Ji's sermons
 tilottama ne faisla kiya ki vah khud jaakar swami ji ke bare main pataa lagaaegi
 She sat quietly in the last line of the disciple congregation's group
 swami ji kaa vyaktitv chumbakeey tha, or unke kamare main ghuste hi ek halaki sugandh vaataavaran main fail gai
 His halo spread throughout the room
 unki aankhon ne sidhe uski aankhon main dekha
 Despite his suspicious nature, Tilottama felt that devotion was brewing in his mind
 ''har aatma paramatma kaa ansh he,’’ swami ji ne pravachan armbh kiya, ''aap apane devatv ko prakat kar sakate hai karm se, bhakthi se, maansik anushaasan yaa darshan se or mukt ho sakate hai

 (with Arvind's input from Agra) piples democratic party (pidipi) kii netaa mahabuuba mufti ne nitish kumaar or abdulla pita-putr jaise netaaon ke secular hone par sawaal uthaae hai
 He said that these people had become part of the NDA government for their own benefit
 mahabuuba ne desh main kai raajnneetik dalon ke secular charitra par sawaal khadey kiye
 He said that a lot of politics is happening on communal riots in many parts of the country including Gujarat
 mahabuuba ne kaha ki narendra modi agar pradhanmantri banate hai to kashmir mudde par vah atal bihari vaajapeyi ke padchinhon par hi chalenge
 In a special conversation with 'mail Today', Mehbooba said that if she saw the benefit of Farooq abdullah-omar Abdullah, Nitish Kumar and others like them, they entered the NDA
 unhone vahaan satta kaa sukh praapt kiya or uske baad endie chhodkar chale gaye
 He declared the BJP a communal party
 kya unke kisi dal se judane se yah tay hoga ki communal koun he or secular koun? mujffarnagar dangon ke baad kya kisi ne istipha diya? yaa phir 1984 ke sikh dangon ke baad kisi ne pad choda? ve dangon ke maamle main itane selective kyon ho jate hai?unhone kaha ki kai varshon se dange ho rahe hai
 But no Chief Minister resigned
 unhone kaha ki agar rajya ke pramukh kaa dangon main haath na bhi ho to usamen un dangon ke liye maafee maangane kaa saahas hona hi chahie, beshak uskaa haath unamem na ho kyonki vah unki raksha ke liye hi us pad par he
 Modi should also apologize for the Gujarat riots
 unhone kaha ki congress ko dangon ke bare main to baat bhi nahin kerani chahie kyonki vah anti communal bill sansad se paas bhi nahin karvaa pai
 He said that Congress played the card of communalism to stop Modi
 darasal upie kaa pradarshan hi itnaa ghatiya tha ki usase desh main dange bade
 Mehbooba said that the Congress launched a campaign to stop Modi from coming to power, but upa's inefficiency, corruption, law and order, etc
, helped strengthen Modi
 unhone kaha ki afzal guru faansee paae logon main 29 wein number par tha
 Beant Singh was the killer before him and Rajiv Gandhi's killer
 lekin unke pehle upie sarkaar ne guru ko faansee par lataka diya taaki sampradayik card khelaa ja sake or modi ko roka ja sake lekin vah usamen buree tarah asafal hui
 The UPA thought that by hanging a Kashmiri Muslim, she would stop Modi but she did not succeed in that
 isse jammu-kashmir ke log or alag-thalag ho gaye
 Mehbooba Mufti has high hopes from Modi
 modi ne kaha he ki vah kashmir par vaajapeyi ji kii nitiyon kaa anusaran karenge
 This is a welcome statement
 hamen iske liye intazaar karnaa hoga or dekhnaa hoga ki vah kya karte hai
 But after coming to power, BJP should have enough courage to take some big and unconventional steps

 Home Minister p Chidambaram admitted that at the time of cvc's appointment, the issue of Pamolin case was being raised on PJ Thomas
 phir bhi sarkaar ne pije thomas ko hi chunaa
 This raises two questions
 
 
 pehla yah ki supreme court main sarkaar ne kyon kaha ki use is maamle kii jaankaree nahin thi or agar sarkaar ko maaloom tha to usne ye galati kyon kii
 Secondly, does it not open the way for the appointment of other corrupt officers
 baharhaal is bayaan se saaf he ki pradhanmantri bhi thomas kii niyukti se pallaa jhaad nahin sakate
 On the other hand, Thomas's refusal to resign has made the government more difficult
 ye saaf he ki maamle main ab sarkaar puri tarah se supreme court par hi ashrith he or vahiin se aakhri faisla aayega
 Now the industry wants the Indian government to complete the formalities related to its implementation from April next year

 If the Governor calls the BJP as the largest party to form the government, Yeddyurappa can manage to prove his majority through Operation Lotus
 oparation lotus kaa matlab he ki congress yaa jedies ke chune hue vidhayakon ko yediurppa sadan main shakti pareekshan ke din yaa to bhaajapa ke paksh main matdaan karne ke liye raji kar lenge yaa unhe sadan main voting se gaiyr hajir rahane ke liye raji kar sakate hai
 In return, Yeddyurappa can offer him a ministerial position in his government
 yadi anya dalon ke vidhayak sadan main wheep jari hone ke baad bhi anupasthit rahete hai yaa bhaajapa ke paksh main vot karte hai to janpratinidhatv kanoon ke tahat unki vidhayaki khatm ho jaaegi
 But he can remain a minister
 aise main vidhayaki khatm hote hi un ilaakon main vidhansabha kii seat rikt ho jaaegi jahaan se vah chune gaye hai
 In such a situation there will be a by-election within six months in which Yeddyurappa will take the responsibility of winning them (mlas)
 chunki rajya main jis party kii sarkaar rahati he amuman up-chunaav main usee party kii jeet hoti he is lihaaj se bhaajapa kii tikat par chunaav jeetna in vidhayakon ke liye adhik kathin nahin hoga
 In 2008, even when Yeddyurappa was CM, he had successfully run Operation Lotus and BJP had won 7 seats out of eight by-elections
 sutron kaa kahana he ki philhal jedies or congress ke 10 vidhayakon se bhaajapa ne sampark kiya he
 Leaving their party (congress or JDS) and joining the BJP, these mlas can be made ministers in the Yeddyurappa government
 halanki, congress or jedies donon yah koshish karegi ki unke vidhayak party ke saath date rahen
 Efforts are also being made by both these parties to put a scolding on the BJP mlas who are not expected to get a place in the Yeddyurappa government
 arthath oparation lotus part do kaa muqabla karne ke liye congress bhi isi tarah kaa oparation chalaa sakati he
 However, everything depends on which party the governor gives the chance to form the government first

 We are not doing 'is the Governor of Bihar a puppet', but this question has been asked in the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) main examination, this question in the second paper of General Knowledge of the Bihar Public Service Commission main examination on Sunday
 Was done critically examine the role of the Governor in the politics of the state in India, especially in the context of Bihar, is he only a puppet? Certainly the teacher who set the question paper might not have thought that these questions could be the cause of controversy
 lekin bihar lok seva ayog ke pariksha niyantrak amarendra kumaar kaa kahana hai ki aisa sawaal purv main bhi kiya jaataa rahaa hai or ayog ke sadasyon yaa adhikariyon ko is baat kii jaankaree nahin hoti ki prashn patr main kya- kya sawaal puche ja rahe hai
 At the same time, many experts believe that it has been the custom to ask such questions, but this time the question setter gave rise to controversy by using the word puppet
 vahiin kai logon kaa kahana hai ki isamen khaas kar bihar or kathputli shabd likhakar ek nayaa vivaad shuru ho gaya he jo rajyapal jaise sanvaidhanik pad ke sandarbh main sahi nahin he
 However, another question was asked in this examination, whether a lot of parties are a curse for Indian politics, clarify this question in the context of Bihar
 is tarah ke sawaal ek tarah se vivaad ko janm dene kaa kaaran ban sakate hai
 However, one more thing to note here is that in the last few years disputes have also come up between the state government and the Rajbhavans in which the central government is also interfering
 vahiin kai logon ne rajyapal jaise padon ko khatm karne kii bhi vakaalat kii he
 Now the thing to be seen is what is the explanation from the Bihar government on the use of words like 'puppet'
 bihar lok seva ayog ne prashn ko lekar vivaad paidaa hone par khed jataayaa he
 The statement issued by the cum-controller of the Commission said that questions were asked incorrectly in the examination
 ayog ne paper banane vaale se kaaran poocha he or unhen bhavishya main prashn patr set karne se vanchit kar diya gaya he
 They have been recorded on the black list
 ayog ne iske liye khed jataayaa he

 unhone twitor par likhaa, 'jab tak asabhy roopesh paul ko media ke saamne laat na maarun, uske dalal jaise chehre par na thukuun, tab tak meraa gussa kam nahin hoga

 Now the film is ready, but Sherlyn is missing from its promotion
 itnaa hi nahin unhone twitor par kaha ki maine to film ke liye mahaj 5 din kii shooting kar ise chhod diya tha
 Reversing this, Director Rupesh Paul said that Sherlyn is adopting these actions to promote her lousy video song 'badgirl'
 roopesh ne yah bhi kaha ki sharleen apane dhandhe ke liye koi dalal khoj len or mujhe yani apane baap ko baksh den
 Rupesh did not stop at this
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki nangai sharleen ke diene main he or main ise badal nahin saktaa

 She was at all the film festivals from Cannes to America and Goa
 mujhe unke twits padhakar yahi lagata he ki ab apane ghatiya acting or singing vaale mujeec video bed girl ko lekar naaraaz hai
 I'd be happy if they get some publicity for that video because of this controversy
 roopesh paul ke saath sharleenmagar unhen nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki yah roopesh paul or kamasutra 3di hi hai, jo unhen cinema kii duniya main limlite main lekar aae
 Due to this film, his stripper (stripping off) created an image of the actress
