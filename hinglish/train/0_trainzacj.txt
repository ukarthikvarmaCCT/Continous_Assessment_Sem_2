 Zakir Musa is the head of the terrorist organization Ansar gajwat-ul-hind (AGH) and is included in the 'most Wanted List' of the security forces

 This room belonged to Zahid Gulzar, a student studying b

 yahaan se yusuf rafique bhatta ke saath jaahid gulzaar or mohammad idris ko bhi giraftaar kiya gaya
 This module is also suspected to be connected to terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed (jem)
 iske alaava jammu-kashmir police ne bhi is modul ke ek aatanki sohail ko giraftaar kiya he
 a total of 4 such terrorists have been arrested
 jammu-kashmir police ke mahanideshak dilbagh singh ne bataaya, ‘ye chaatr jakir musa ke aatanki sanghathan kaa hissaa hai
 a team of Jammu Police was sent for a joint operation with the Punjab Police

 He said that all three are suspected of being involved in carrying out any major activity
 saath hi avantipora main ek sandigdh handler ko bhi hiraasat main liya gaya he
 Punjab DGP Suresh Arora said that the disclosure of the Terror module linked to the AGH and the seizure of weapons indicate how the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI is trying to create disturbances in the area bordering India's western border
 aroda ke mutabik jaanch se khulaasa hua he ki is modul ke jaish-e-mohammad se bhi taar jude hai
 Yusuf Rakif Bhatt walked the path of Zakir Musa's terror
 bataa den ki musa ne bhi chandigarh main ejineering kii padhai kii thi
 Musa returned to his home in Tral when he was studying in the third semester at Ramdevi Jindal College, Chandigarh
 musa pehle hijbul mujahidin se judaa lekin matbhedon ke chalate usne phir apana aatanki sanghathan ansaar gajavat-ul-hind bana liya
 According to sources, Musa's terrorist organization may have plans to expand its activities in Punjab
 ye giraftaaryaan aise vakt main hui hai jab aisi atakalein joro par hai ki musaatanki sangathnonki aapasi ladaai main maaraa gaya ho saktaa he
 Although the DGP has said it all unknowingly, the death of Moses has not been confirmed yet
 police sutron ne bataaya ki aage jaanch kii ja rahi he or punjab police puri sajeesh ko benakaab karne ke liye jammu or kashmir police ke saath mil kar kaam kar rahi he
 Efforts are being made to find out how far the network of these terrorist organizations is spread in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab? kendriya mantri gangavar ke bayaan par priyanka gandhi kaa hamalaamantri bole- wo ek chunaav ladakar dikhaaen, phir karen aisi batsantosh gangavar bole- mere bayaan ko tod marod kar rakhaa gayauttar bharatiyon main yogyata kii kami vaale kendriya mantri santosh gangavar ke bayaan ko lekar vipakshi partiyon ne sawaal khadaa kiya he
 Now the Union Minister has targeted Priyanka Gandhi on the contrary
 santosh gangavar kaa kahana he ki priyanka gandhi pehle ek chunaav ladakar dikhaaen phir aisi baat karen
 Santosh Gangwar clarified his statement, saying, 'we have not given any such statement
 main itnaa hi kah saktaa hum ki sarkaar ke 100 din ke kaam ko lekar puure desh ke andar mantri press conference kar logon se baatcheet kar rahe hai
 All i can say is that a couple of media gentlemen have misrepresented what i said
 meraa aagrah he ki jo maine bolaa he use koi dekhe to samaj main aa jayega ki maine aisa kuch nahin kaha tha
 Explaining his statement, he added, "I only said that wherever children go for interviews, they do not have talent in the accounts of the industry, so they have problems
" unhone kaha ki isi ko dekhte hue hamaari sarkaar ne ek nayaa mantralay isi kaam ke liye kholaa he
 The job of this ministry is to educate children according to jobs

 main unako kahana chahta hum jo is par bhaashan de rahe hai ve jamini sachai ko samajhane kaa kaam karen ki asal main naukari kaise milti he
 If there is no suitable qualification for the job, then there is a problem
 'unhone priyanka gandhi par hamalaa karte hue kaha, 'jo chunaav nahin lade ve tippanee kar rahe hai, isse mujhe takalif he
 i am from North India and i have come from the major city of North India after contesting elections many times, so i will not respect anyone, but the problem is that those leaders who do not like Modi's reputation
 modi jis dhang se kaam kar rahe hai unhen lagata he ki unki jameen khatm ho rahi he, isliye koi naa koi bahaanaa talash kar aisa kar rahe hai
 We are exploring such things as how to take the government into the dock
 'santosh gangavar ne kaha ki hamaari sarkaar ne skill deveopment mantralay kholaa he or bacchon ko usee hisaab se training di ja rahi, jisase unhen job mil sake
 He said, 'all the governments that have been in our Uttar Pradesh in the last 15 years have not established industries, so people have not got so much jobs
 ham is disha main kaam kar rahe hai
 We have worked to open textile park inside our city, so that people can get work in this direction

 In the title satire in the plus-minus market, he underlines that in today's times emotion, responsibility, humanity, etc
 are not diseases but diseases and the person suffering from them is killed in the market one day

 Tolerate your criticism is the primary condition of being democratic

 To speak correctly about him means ending the relationship

 The author does not have much political satire, but the connotations of what they are are very deep
 aise hansoge to hansanaa bhul jaaoge beta ek aisa hi vyangy he
 The democratic power that turns into dictatorship is not tolerated
 abhivyakti par ho rahe hamale ke sandarbh main is vyangy kaa mahatv kaaphi bad jaataa he
 Sushil selects words very consciously and expands the multiple meanings contained in them

 mumbai main ek news channel ke daphtar main gundgardee kaa ghatiya namoona pesh karne ke baad, ab shivasena kii kisiyahat saamne ai he
 Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray has justified the attack by writing articles in the face, as well as his anger on the media
 ye dadaageeri kii had nahin to or kya he ki raajnneetik party ke taur par chunaav ladane vaali ek party ke gunde, janata kii awazdabane kii koshish karte hai
 Attacking the news channel creates a ruckus and the head of the same party justifies the attack and curses the media
 shivasena supremeo bal thakare ne saamana main likhaa he ki media koi bhagwaan nahin he
 In the IBN Lokmat office, the desperation of the nationwide backlash after the Shiv Sena attack is such
 saamana main bal thakare ne likhaa he kimedia kii bhoomika ab ramshaastra kii nahin balki daamshaastra kii ho gai he
 How the media is doing this to defame a party or its leader
 media ne hitler ko bhi peeche chhod diya he
 The media did the work of creating confusion and doubt among the voters of Maharashtra
 shivasainikon kii gundgardee ke peeche shivasena ne daleel di ki sachin ke maamle main ibien lokmat ne bal thakare kii baat ko mudda banaaya
 Bal Thackeray wrote in the face that we said something more about Sachin, the media told him something else
 to kya hamen apane maharashtra yaa mumbai ke bare main ek shabd bhi bolne ke liye media se poochna padegaa?chunaavon main haar se tilamilaae bal thakare kii bhadaas, rah-rah kar nikal rahi he
 He has said in the face that the media owners are either politicians or rich
 marathiyon ke mudde par media ke pet main dard uthta he or unke paale hue log wo dard baahar nikaalane kaa kaam karte hai
 In the Saamna article, Bal Thackeray has expressed his full frustration on the media that he further writes that the media has been lost in the chamchagiri and ji-huzuri
 jahaan tak maharashtra main congress-ensipi kii jeet kaa sawaal he to aisa galati se ho gaya
 In the end, Bal Thackeray has also said that what the Shiv Sainiks did in the IBN Lokmat office was not an attack, but a spurt of their anger
 saaf lagata he ki vidhansabha chunaavon main haar ke baad shivasena buree tarah baukhala gai he

 If he still does not end the strike and return to work, strict action can be taken against him
 sambhavat: sarkaar un par esma bhi laga sakati he
 The comments sarkaar ke mutabik, doctoron kii sabhi maang somvaar raat hi maan lee gai hai, aise main hadtaal khatm na karne kii koi vajah nahin ho sakati
 In fact, about 15 to 20 thousand resident doctors of Delhi government hospitals associated with Federation of Resident Doctors Association went on indefinite strike from Monday
 haalanki dilli sarkaar ne unki sari maangen maan leen, lekin centre or emsidi kii taraf se doctoron kii maangon ko lekar koi jaankaree nahin mil pai or hadtaal philhal jari he
 This especially increased the difficulty of patients who had to be treated in OPD
 immergency sevaaon par koi asar nahin padaa he
 According to the government, all the demands of doctors have been accepted only on Monday night, so there can be no reason for not ending the strike
 darasal, federation of resident doctors association se jude dilli ke sarkari aspataalon ke takreeban 15 se 20 hajaar resident doctor somvaar se anishchakaalin hadtaal par chale gaye the
 Although the Delhi government accepted all their demands, no information was received from the Center and the MCD about the demands of the doctors and the strike is currently going on
 isse khaskar un marijon kii pareshaani bad gai, jinhen opidi main ilaaj karwaanaa tha
 Emergency services have not been affected

 Suggestion of examination for promotion The Chief Minister suggested to conduct an examination for promotion of administrative officers and said that it should be made mandatory to pass
 isse tallent ko ubharne main madad milegi
 He said that apart from ACR, the provision to pass the exam is also necessary because promotions are often done on the basis of recommendation

 The Supreme Court has admitted that during the Emergency in 1975, it violated the fundamental rights of Indian citizens
 iske saath hi nyaayalay ne hatya ke maamle main apni ore se sunai gai maut kii sajaa ko umrakaid main tabdeel kar diya
 a division bench of Justice Aftab Alam and Justice Ashok Kumar Ganguly held this opinion with reference to the state of emergency in one of its decisions
 khandpeeth ne kaha ki varsh 1976 main jabalpur ke ediem ve shivakant shukla ke maamle main ucchtam nyaayalay kii paanch nyayadhishon kii peeth dwaara moulik adhikaron kaa nilamban barkaraar rakhane kaa faisla sahi nahin tha
 Justice Ganguly opined, there is no doubt that the court's majority decision in the ADM case of Jabalpur violated the fundamental rights of the people of the country
 nyaayadhish ne hatya ke maamle main maut kii sajaa paae ramdev chouhan urf rajnath chouhan ko di maut kii sajaa ko bhi badal diya
 a division bench with his own presence upheld the death sentence awarded to Chauhan in a judgment delivered on May 5, 2009
 chouhan ne aath march, 1992 ko apane hi parivaar ke chaar logon kii hatya kar di thi
 Justice Ganguly said, recalling the majority verdict given by the court in Jabalpur's Additional District Magistrate v Shivakant Shukla's case, the judges were of the opinion that as per the order issued by the President on June 27, 1975 No person detained under the restrictive law MISA can file a petition under Article 226
 raashtrapati kaa yah aadesh samvidhan ke anuchhed 359 (1) ke tahat aayaa tha
 After this emergency case, the bench also gave a clear opinion about Chauhan's case
 pehle ucchtam nyaayalay kii hi ek khandpeeth ne yah kehete hue maut kii sajaa ko barkaraar rakhaa tha, ucchtam nyaayalay kii ore se koi faisla barkaraar rakhe jane ke baad rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog ke paas is baat adhikaar nahin he ki vah maut kii sajaa ko umrakaid main badanale ke liye rajyapal se sifarish kare
 In fact, Chauhan was sentenced to death by a sessions court in Guwahati
 baad main ucch nyaayalay ne bhi is sajaa ko barkaraar rakhaa
 Not only this, on July 31, 2000, a bench of Justices KT Thomas and RP Sethi in the Supreme Court also upheld Chauhan's death sentence
 chouhan kii daleel yah thi ki vaardaat ke vakt vah mahaj 16 saal kaa tha or is aadhaar par use maut kii sajaa nahin di ja sakati
 Later in the medical examination, the court found that he was 20 years old at the time of the incident and in this case his case did not come under the Juvenile Justice Act
 is maamle par daayar ek yachika kii sunwaayee karte hue 10 may, 2001 ko nyaayalay kii ek khandpeeth ne bahumat se chouhan kii sajaa ko barkaraar rakhane kaa faisla phir kar diya
 In this judgment only, a judge gave a different opinion
 is nyaayadhish ne kaha ki chouhan kii umr ko lekar andeh he or aise main use umrakaid kii sajaa di ja sakati thi
 The Human Rights Commission intervened after an article was published in a journal on the Chauhan case
 ayog ne assam ke rajyapal se aagrah kiya ki chouhan kii umr ko lekar andeh hone kii sthiti main use mili maut kii sajaa ko umrakaid main tabdeel kiya janaa chahie
 Following this recommendation of the Commission, the aggrieved families moved the Supreme Court
 nyaayalay ne aath may, 2009 ko ayog ko fatkaraar lagaai or kaha ki uske paas is maamle main dakhal dene kaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 Chauhan filed a review petition challenging the Supreme Court's decision for the second time
 ab uski yachika par nyaayalay ne kaha, agar ham varsh 1993 ke adhinium kii dhara 12 (je) par gaur karenge to maaloom padataa he ki maanavadhikaar ayog maanavadhikaron ko badhaava dene ke liye jaruri pahal kar saktaa he
 The Reserve Bank of India has said that given the inflationary pressures in the coming years, there is little scope for further cuts in interest rates
 kendriya bank ke dipti governor subir gokarn ne fikki kii ek baithak ke maukey par samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘hamane april main byaaj daron main katautee kaa silsilaa shuru kiya
 But if you look at our inflation estimates, inflationary pressures persist in the medium to long term
 is tarah byaaj daron main or katautee kii gunjaaish nahin dikhti

 On the fluctuations in the rupee, Gokarn said that the Reserve Bank is taking necessary steps for this
 unhone kaha, ‘main is par koi anumaan nahin lagaaunga ki kab kya hoga
 We will take action according to the market situation
 ’ Central Bank Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn told reporters on the sidelines of a FICCI meeting, 'we started the process of cutting interest rates in April
 lekin yadi aap hamaare mudrasphiti ke anumaan ko dekhen to madhyam se dderghaavadhi main mudrasphithik dabaav barkaraar he
 Thus, there is no scope for further reduction in interest rates
 ’ unhone kaha ki haalanki vruddhi or mahangaai kaa santulan sakaaratmak tareeke se badal rahaa he, madhyam se dderghaavadhi main mudrasphithik dabaav kaayam he

 chunaav aate hi netaaon ke andhvishwaas par vishwaas kii khabaren bhi surkhiyon main aane lagati hai
 For example, in Uttar Pradesh's Noida, the Chief Minister of the state does not go to Noida for the last 28 years
 noida ke saare udghaatan lakhanu se karte hai
 ND went to Tiwari in 1989, after which he left his chair
 isi vaham kii vajah se rajnath singh ne 2001 main noida fliover kaa udghaatan dilli chor se kiya
 The Nithari incident occurred in 2006 when Mulayam Singh was the Chief Minister
 
 
 andolan hua
 The government was shaken but did not go to Noida
 2011 main mayawati noida gayi to 2012 main chunaav harkar satta se baahar ho gayi
 It is due to this trend that this time Akhilesh Yadav started campaigning from the fifth phase instead of the first phase
 lihaaja sultanpur se mangalvaar ke din unhone chunavi abhiyaan kaa aagaaj kiya
 Though elections were to be held in western UP in the first phase, but according to the 'disha Shool' rule of astrology, they do not travel in the west direction for auspicious work on Tuesday
 ye bhi kaha jaataa he ki 2012 main yaheen se prachaar shuru kar akhilesh satta main aae
 So on Tuesday, it held its first election rally here
 bhale hi chunaav yahaan paanchaven charan main ho
 The comments isi tarah kuch samay pehle lakhanu main bijepi daftar main ek bahut purana ped aandhi main gir gaya to log khush hue
 It was such that due to the tree, the assembly is not visible in front, so the party is backward
 congress daftar ko lekar vaham he ki vahaan jo adhyaksh putai karaata he uski kursi chali jaati he
 Mahavir Prasad in 1992, ND Tiwari in 1995, Salman Khurshid in 1998, and Rita Joshi in 2012 had all gone away after sub-painting
 vaham kii vajah se congress daftar main ashok ke ped bade hote hi kaat dete hai
 In this regard, Congress workers here say that if the Ashoka tree rises higher than the roof of the building, then it is considered very bad
 isi tarah chittu pandey ne jange aazaadee ladi or baliya ko angrejon se aaazaad karakar vahaan janata kii sarkaar bana di thi
 But the idea is that the leader who garlands his idol will go to his chair
 indira gandhi ne murti kaa anaavaran kiya to maari gayi
 
 
 When Rajiv Gandhi garlanded the idol, he was killed
 gel singh ne maala pahanaai to unhen dil kaa daura padaa
 In this case, the local people of Ballia say that Chittu Pandey of the child has immense reverence but due to superstition no one goes to enroll from there

 koi raajnneetik dal apni party kaa kaarykram vahaan nahin karata kyonki shubh kaary karte samay log udhar se aana-janaa pasand nahin karte
 Similarly, some time ago, people were happy when a very old tree fell in a storm in the BJP office in Lucknow
 aisa vaham tha ki ped kii vajah se saamne vidhansabha nahin dikhti isliye party pichhadi he
 The Congress office is so anxious that the chair that gets painted there goes away
 1992 main mahavir prasad, 1995 main endi tiwari, 1998 main salmaan khurshid or 2012 main reeta joshi sab putai ke baad hi hate the
 Because of this, Ashoka trees are cut down in the Congress office as they grow
 is sambandh main yahaan ke congress kaaryakartaaon kaa kahana he ki ashok kaa ped agar building kii chat se ooncha ho jaae to ye bahut apshakun mana jaataa he
 In the same way, Chittu Pandey fought freedom of independence and liberated Ballia from the British and formed a government of the people there
 lekin vaham he ki jo netaa unki murti ko maala pahanayega uski kursi jaaegi
 When Indira Gandhi unveiled the statue, she was killed
 
 
 rajeev gandhi ne murti ko maala pahanaai to unki hatya hui
 When Zail Singh put a garland on him, he suffered a heart attack
 is maamle main baliya ke sthaneey logon kaa kahana he ki bachche-bachche kii chittu pandey main apaar shraddha he lekin andhvishwaas ke kaaran koi udhar se namakan karne ke liye nahin jaataa
 No political party does its party program there because people do not like to come and go while doing auspicious work
 isi tarah chittu pandey ne jange aazaadee ladi or baliya ko angrejon se aaazaad karakar vahaan janata kii sarkaar bana di thi
 But the idea is that the leader who garlands his idol will go to his chair
 indira gandhi ne murti kaa anaavaran kiya to maari gayi

 kendriya mantri jairam ramesh ne ek baar phir apni hi party ke 'bade netaaon' kii aalochana karke halchal machaa di he
 Ramesh said there was a lack of political dialogue among the top Congress leaders
 unhone kaha ki bijepi upie ke shasankaal ko bhrasht bataati rahi, jabaki congress uski is muhim kaa karaara jawaab nahin de saki
 Jairam Ramesh accepted that after remaining in power for 10 years, the Congress has to fight the anti-incumbency wave
 ramesh ne kaha, ‘ham raajnneetik samvaad kaayam karne main safal nahin rahe
 Political dialogue does not happen in the last minute
 aapako lambey samay tak raajnneetik samvaad karnaa hota he
 i believe the Congress has been hurt by this
 ’bhrashtachar ke muddon par sarkaar ke khilaaf vipaksh ke hamalon par unhone mana ki 2ji, rashtramandal khel or anya ghotaalon ne nishchit taur par congress kii sambhaavnaaon ko chot pahunchaaya he
 Ramesh said, 'I always believe that one of the foundations of politics is dialogue and dialogue at the very top level
 
 
 akele ‘sherpaon’ dwaara
 Therefore, political dialogue is very important, but unfortunately we lacked it
 ’unhone kaha, ‘‘kaig or behad sakriy nyaaypalika ke kaaran bijepi ne behad aakraamak abhiyaan chalaaya or samaaj bhi uske samarthan main kud gaya or meraa maananaa he ki us avadhi main hamane (congress) us tarah kii aakraamakata nahin dikhaai jaisaa hamen dikhaanaa chahie tha
 Ramesh criticized dmk's former ally DMK as 'ungrateful' and termed then minister TR Balu as 'no less trouble'
 jahaan tak 2014 ke chunaavon kaa sawaal he, to ramesh ne kaha ki vah diemke ke rukh se ‘niraash’ hai
 The DMK does not have an alliance with the Congress in the recently concluded elections in Tamil Nadu
 ramesh ne kaha, ‘diemke ko congress se kaaphi kuch mila
 Earlier, the DMK government would not have survived without the support of the Congress and it would not have run for five years
 diemke ko (samprag main) vah jo bhi mantralay chaahati thi, mila or jis tareeke se vah chaahati thi us tareeke se usne bartaav kiya
 'when UPA-1 was the Minister for Sand Surface Transport, the National Highways Authority of India under his ministry had five chairpersons
 ramesh ne kaha, ‘vah (baaluu) paryaavaran va van mantri the
 Raja (then Telecom Minister)
 
 
 main jaanata hum ki unhone kya kiya
 Ramesh said, 'I believe that DMK should be a little more aware of its debt to Congress
 meraa maananaa he ki usne congress ke prati jo kiya vah durbhagyapurna he or shrimati (sonia) gandhi ke man main karunanidhi ke prati jo agaadh sammaan he, uske maddenjar meraa maananaa he ki diemke kritagn thi
 When asked if Prime Minister Manmohan Singh should have made his point strongly in the allocation of ministries to the DMK, Ramesh said that there are some compulsions of coalition politics and they are not aware of what was discussed
 diemke upie-1 or pichley saal march tak upie-2 kaa hissaa thi or srilankai tamilon ke mudde par sarkaar se hati thi
 Ramesh said, "but i can tell you that sand was the least troublesome as the Minister of Surface Transport and Environment and Forests

 patrika ke pravaktaa ali jelenco ne kaha, time farid ke maafeename ko sweekaar karata he, lekin unhone jo kiya, vah stambhakaron ke liye hamaare maapdand kaa ulanghan he
 Their work should not only be factual, but also fundamental
 unke vichaar na keval unke apane hone chahie, balki unke shabd bhi apane hone chahie
 "as a result, we are stopping the Farid column for a month and further review is underway," Time said

 He apologized, stating that he had made a "terrible mistake" and taking a paragraph from an article by Harvard University professor of American history, Jill Lepore, was a moral flaw

 time ne kaha ki jakaaria ke stambh ko ek maheene ke liye roka ja rahaa he or isaki samiksha ho rahi he
 The magazine's spokesman, Ali Jalenko, said Time accepts Farid's apology, but what he did is a violation of our criteria for columnists
 unka kaam na keval tathyaatmak hona chahie, balki moulik bhi hona chahie
 His thoughts should not only be his own, but his words should also be his own
 time ne kaha, parinamswaroop ham farid ke stambh ko ek maheene ke liye roak rahe hai or aage kii samiksha jari he

 *** bihar main argedy or jediu ke bich gathbandhan kii daraar lagaataar badhati dikh rahi he or raajnneetik galiyaaron main gathbandhan ke tuutane ke bhi kayaas joro par hai
 On Saturday, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav were to come together on one stage, but Tejashwi did not attend the event amidst the knot in the Grand Alliance
 yahaan pehle tejasvi ke nemplate par pardaa chadhaakar rakhaa gaya tha, lekin baad main vah nemplate hi hataa diya gaya
 It is worth noting here that JDU gave a 4-day ultimatum to its partner RJD to take a decision on Tejashwi, which is the last day today, in the state executive meeting held on Tuesday
 haalanki jediu ke is ultimatum par argedy kii taraf se koi gambhirtha nahin dikhi
 At the same time RJD Supremo Laloo Prasad also made it clear that the resignation of his son Tejashwi from the Deputy CM post does not arise
 argedy kii taraf se is tarah kii pratikriya ke baad siemanithish kumaarane ravivaar ko mukhyamantri awaas par jediu vidhayakon kii baithak bulaai he
 It is believed that in this meeting, a decision will be taken on further relations with RJD
 bataa den ki lalu yadav or unke parivaar ke sadasyon par gaiyrkanoonee dhang se sampatti banane ke aarope main sibiai or idi ke chhaapon ke baad tejasvi par istife kaa dabaav badha he
 However, Lalu and Tejashwi have called the allegations a conspiracy by the bjp-led central government
 tejasvi ne to apane bachaav main yah daleel di ki ye maamla 2004 kaa he, jab vah mahaj 13-14 saal the, aise main vah koi ghotaalaa kaise kar sakate hai
 However, it was said by the JDU that the party is not satisfied with these arguments of Tejashwi
 iske baad argedy vidhayak bhai virendra kaa bayaan aayaa ki argedy ke paas 80 vidhayak hai or mahagathbandhan main vahi hoga, jo argedy chaahegi
 JDU has reacted strongly to this statement of RJD MLA
 jediu vidhayak ne kaha ki nitish kumaar satta ke bhukhe nahin hai or unhen istipha dene main paanch minute bhi nahin lagenge
 JDU has reacted strongly to this statement of RJD MLA
 jediu vidhayak ne kaha ki nitish kumaar satta ke bhukhe nahin hai or unhen istipha dene main paanch minute bhi nahin lagenge
 JDU leader KC Tyagi said that Nitish Kumar has his own image and there will be no compromise with corruption
 in talkh bayanon to aisa hi andaja lagata he ki bihar main mahagathbandhan kaa countdown ab shuru ho gaya he or ravivaar ko siem awaas par hone baithak main jediu ajedy se apane naate todane kaa elaan kar sakati he
 Looking at the power equation of Bihar, the RJD is the single largest party with 80 seats in the 243-member assembly
 vahiin jediu ke paas 71 siten he, to bijepi ke khate main 58 siten hai
 The Congress has 27 seats
 siton ke maamle main duusare number par rahane ke baavjood nitish kumaar bihar ke siem bane
 In such a situation, if Nitish joins hands with BJP, if RJD breaks ties, he will remain in power by crossing majority mark with 129 seats (71 + 58)

 isi bich makapa ke mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 CPI (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said on Monday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is resorting to lies to intensify communal polarization in favor of BJP during elections
 pashchim bengal ke jhargram main ek chunavi sabha main modi ne ramayana or mahabharat ke bare main yechuri ke haal hi main die gaye bayaan ko apmanjanak bataate hue isaki aalochana kii thi
 In response, Yechury said that Modi misinterpreted his statement by resorting to lies
 aapako bataa den ki seetaram yechuri ne kaha tha ki ramayana or mahabharat kii ladaai hinsa se bhari hui thi
 In such a situation, what is the logic of associating one religion with violence
 makapa mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki unhone bhopal main bhaajapa dwaara aatankwaad ke maamle main aaropee sadhvi pragna singh thakur ko ummidavaar banaaye jane ke sandarbh main kaha tha ki aatank kaa koi dharm nahin hota he
 Yechury clarified his statement that people who support violence are found in every community
 yahaan tak ki ramayana or mahabharat main bhi is tarah ke logon kaa zikr kiya gaya he
 Sitaram Yechury alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to incite religious sentiments of the people
 unhone kaha ki modi sampradayik dhruvikaran ke liye jhooth kaa sahaara le rahe hai
 It is noteworthy that Prime Minister Modi attacked the leftists in a public meeting and said that the use of derogatory language against Hindutva has become a pastime of communists

 The open threat that the NCP has given on Tuesday means that if the Congress does not accept the demands, the NCP will be out of the government
 ek hafte se congress or ensipi main khinchataan chal rahi he
 a minor rift has led to the break-up of the relationship, but nothing is clear yet as to how the matter will be resolved

 However, former Chief Minister Mayawati and Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav are constantly attacking the BJP government of UP due to poor law and order in the state
 mayawati ne jahaan kai baar yogi adityanath sarkaar par sawaal khadey kiye to akhilesh yadav ne rajyapal ram nik se mulaakaat kar memorondom saunpa tha
 Bahujan Samaj Party national president Mayawati wrote on Twitter, 'anarchy-like situation in UP in terms of crime control and law and order situation, as well as the life of Sasamaj's sister- daughters, respect and dignity - very sad And a matter of great concern

 The Congress has spoken out against the Modi government over the Rafale plane deal
 party adhyaksh rahul gandhi lagataarrafel dilko lekar piem modi ko gher rahe hai
 The Congress is describing the Rafale deal as Modi's 'personal deal'
 is kadi main shuukravaar ko party pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne press brifing karke rafel deal ko lekar sawaal uthaae hai
 Surjewala said that the Modi government is telling 100 lies to hide a lie regarding the Rafale deal
 unhone kaha ki raksha mantri ne 17 november 2017 ko raksha mantralay main ek brifing main kaha tha ki vah rafel kii keemat bataaegi
 However, why is this not being done now? surajevaala ne kaha ki sarkaar koun sa rahasy chupa rahi he, jisase desh ko khatra he
 Surjewala said that the Congress demands that the price of Rafale be stated in the national interest
 surajevaala ne sawaal uthaaya kivitt mantricyon kah rahe hai ki isse rashtrahit ko khatra he
 The price of the ship is not a matter of national security, it is a matter of revenue of the country
 unke jawaab se to pataa chalegaa ki isamen desh kaa kitna paisa kharch hua
 Surjewala alleged that the government bought Rafael at 300 per cent more price, so now it is hiding under the cover of national interest
 unhone kaha ki us samay rafel kii keemat kam thi, isaliye congress ne ise final kiya tha
 Surjewala asked if the Finance Minister would tell the country why the letter was put in the trash when another company, Typhoon, was giving cheaper ship to the country in lieu of Rafael as his defense minister
 Why did the Prime Minister not get the cabinet's consent? Why was the 30 thousand crore contract of Hindustan Aeronautics in this country rejected and given to a private company? The Congress leader said that the mess of Rafael is the truth of BJP and Modi government
 raksha mantri, vitt mantri or pradhanmantri aae din is desh ko bhatakaane or galat chizon par pardaa daalane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Surjewala said that the more lies they lie, the more their lies are captured

 From the platform of Panchayat Aaj Tak program, Amit Shah, the president of Bharatiya Janata Party, kept an account of the four years of work of the Modi government
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne koi ek uplabdhi hasil nahin kii, balki desh ke vikaas ke liye har kshetra main kaam kiya or uplabdhi hasil kii he
 He also said that opposition unity will not affect BJP, we will form government again in 2019
 sarkaar kii sabase badi uplabdhi par baat karte hue amit shah ne kaha ki hamaari uplabdhi yahi he ki hamane chunaav se pehle jitne bhi vaade kiye, unamem se adhikansh vaadon ko ham samaapt karke paanchaven saal main pravesh karne ja rahe hai
 He said that the entire cabinet worked with PM Modi to fulfill the objective of what we had decided in every area and fulfilled it
 bhrashtachar unmulan ke liye ho, krishi ke kshetra main ho, garibi unmoolan ke liye ho, desh ko surakshit karne ke liye ho, desh ke gaurav ko badhaane ke liye ho, har kshetra main tay kiye gaye lakshya kii prapti ke liye pradhanmantri se lekar sarkaar ke chote se chote karmchaaree tak ne kaam kiya he
 Talking about the difference in victory between BJP and Congress, he said that in the 70s, when the Congress party was weak, he killed democracy, put emergency and silenced the media
 lekin bhartiya janata party ne parishram ke aadhaar par lokapriyata hasil kii he
 i can say with a claim that the most popular leader in the whole world is Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 yah isliye he kyonki hamane sarkaar kii chizon ko logon tak pahunchaakar unka man jitkar sarkaar banaai lekin congress ne jitani bhi jeet hasil kii wo kahin na kahin sarkaar par aadhaarit thi
 On the opposition unity seen after the Karnataka elections, Amit Shah said that in that whole picture there was no person or face other than Chandrababu Naidu who did not contest against us in 2014
 hamane 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sabhi ko haraaya tha or purna bahumat kii sarkaar banaai thi
 We will win in 2019 and form the government again
 bijepi par vipakshi ekta se koi fark nahin padegaa
 He said that if we look at this picture, you will find that a small change has been seen only in UP where Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav have become one
 unhone kaha ki jab do ladke ek saath upi main aae the tab bhi yah kaha gaya ki upi main bhaajapa nahin aegi lekin hua kya, hamaari 325 siten ain
 Amit Shah said that we will fight for 50 percent
 uttar pradesh main ek seat badhegi kam nahin hogi
 He said that after 1967, BJP is the only party which has got 50 percent votes

 bharat-china vyapaar ghate ko paatane ke liye donon deshon main ahm sahmati ho gai he
 Union Commerce and Industry Minister Suresh Prabhu said that the Chinese government has agreed to increase its imports from India
 confederation of indian industry (siaiai) ke manch se prabhu ne daawa kiya ki maujuuda vaishvik chunautiyon ne bharat ko apana niryaat badhaane kaa sunaharaa kaa diya he
 According to Prabhu, the Chinese government has decided to meet the Indian exporter in November
 is mulaakaat main bhartiya exporter dwaar china main trade baadhaon ko dur karne ke liye ahm kadam uthaane kii kavayad kii jaaegi
 While China is the world's largest exporter in global business, India has to incur the largest trade deficit from China

 These are the five achievements of India that are scaring China that for a long time India has been struggling with the problem of serious trade deficit
 vyapaar ghaataa yani kisi desh ke aayaat or niryaat main antar
 If a country buys the product it needs from the global market but does not export the same price to the world, then it is a victim of trade deficit
 is vyapaar ghate kaa khamiyaja desh kii arthvyavastha ko uthaanaa padataa he
 Crude oil, gold, coal and smartphones are the major products in India's imports which is responsible for its large trade deficit
 is ghate ko paatane ke liye jahaan ek vikalp in utpaadon main vaishvik bazaar par nirbharta kam karnaa he, vahiin doosraa vikalp anya utpaadon main adhik niryaat karte hue bhi vyapaar ghate ko pata ja saktaa he
 Where crude oil, gold and coal are in the category of natural resources and there is an import obligation for them, the trade deficit of the country can be bridged by another option
 china ke CPEC jhaanse main fansaa pakistan to greece jaise honge halaat?vahiin utpaada ke alaava china, switsraland or soudi arab se vyapaar main bharat ko sabase zyada ghaataa hota he, lihaaja in deshon ko bharat anya utpaada bechakar hi apane vyapaar ghate ko kam kar saktaa he
 According to the country's trade statistics, by 2017, India has to bear a loss of about $ 150 billion in the export-import of all products
 vahiin 2010 tak yah vyapaar ghaataa lagbhag 130 billian dollar ke str par tha
 Now to bridge this deficit, the Modi government has prepared to play bets on rice and white mustard produced in the country
 gauratlab he ki haal hi main china sarkaar ne bharat se gaiyr-basmati chaaval kharidne par pratibandh ko hataane ke baad ab safed sarson or soyabean par pratibandh hataanaa kaa faisla liya he

 Actress Shweta Basu Prasad, once popular as a child artiste, came into the limelight almost two years ago for the wrong reasons, when she was arrested for allegedly prostitution
 
 
 lekin ab unhone parde par vaapasi kii he, or hamen puraa bharosa he, jis film main vah phir dikhi hai, use bahut pasand kiya jayega, bhale hi vah cinemaolon main release nahin hogi
 
 
 Actually, Shweta Basu Prasad appeared in a short film 'interior Cafe - Night', in which she is also joined by acting veterans Naseeruddin Shah and Shernaz Patel, and she plays Shernaz's youthful character
 
 
 utyub or soshal media ke is yug main kisi short film ko film festivalon jaise kisi aayojan kaa intazaar nahin karnaa padataa he, so, adhiraj bose dwaara nirdeshit yah film utyub par somvaar ko aplod kii gai, or ab yah dekhi or saraahi ja rahi he
 
 
 'interior Cafe - Night' is the story of two lovers who got separated 30 years ago, and now suddenly come face to face in a cafe in Kolkata
 
 
 darasal, raat ko jab cafe band karne kaa vakt hota he, cafe ke maalik nasiruddin shah ko ek graahak baithi dikhaai detii hai, or vah cafe ko band karne kaa iraadaa kuch der ke liye multavee kar detaa he
 
 
 It is then soon realized that this meeting is not between the cafe owner and the customer, but between the two lovers, who were separated from each other 30 years ago in a flood of tears and sinks of despair
 
 
 iske baad bhi aisa lagata he ki kismat unhen zyaada lambii mulaakaat kaa mauka nahin degi, basharte
 
 
 The comments bas, iske baad kii kahani aap khud hi dekhen, to behatar hoga
 
 
 All we can tell is that Shweta Basu Prasad has also been named as the co-producer of this film directed by Adhiraj Bose, and in addition to Shweta playing the role of Naseer, Shernaz and her youth, Nasir's youth Naveen Kasturia plays Roop
 
 
 darasal, shweta basu prasad ek short film 'interior cafe - nite' main dikhaai deen, jisamen unke saath abhinay kii duniya ke diggaj nasiruddin shah or shernaz patel bhi maujuud hai, or vah shernaz kii yuvavastha vaala kirdaar hi nibhaa rahi hai
 
 
 In this era of youtube and social media, no short film has to wait for an event like film festivals, so, directed by Adhiraj Bose, the film was uploaded on youtube on Monday, and is now being watched and appreciated
 
 
 'interior cafe - nite' do aise chaahane waalon kii kahani he, jo 30 saal pehle bichad gaye the, or ab ve achaanak kolkata ke ek cafe main raat ko aamane-saamne aa jate hai
 
 
 In fact, when it is time to close the cafe at night, the owner of the cafe, Nasiruddin Shah, sees a customer sitting, and he postpones the intention of closing the cafe for a while
 
 
 phir jald hi ehsaas ho jaataa he ki yah mulaakaat cafe maalik or graahak ke bich nahin, do premiyon ke bich ho rahi he, jo 30 saal pehle aansuon ke sailaab or niraashaa ke gart main duube ek-duusare se alag ho gaye the
 
 
 Even after this, it seems that luck will not give them a chance of a long meeting, provided
 
 
 tippaniyan Just look at the story after that yourself, it would be better
 
 
 ham sirf itnaa or bataa sakate hai ki adhiraj bose dwaara nirdeshit is film kii sah-nirmaataa ke rup main bhi shweta basu prasad kaa naam diya gaya he, or isamen naseer, shernaz or unki yuvavastha kii bhoomika adaa kar raheen shweta ke alaava naseer ke yuva rup ko nibhaate naveen kasturiya nazar aa rahe hai

 Pahlaj Nihalani is enraged after Govinda's film 'rangeela Raja' is not released properly and he has openly expressed his pain about the film
 pehlaaj nihlani (pahlaj Nihalani) kaa kahana he ki unki film ko jarurat ke mutabik cinemaghar nahin mili or yah isliye hua, kyonki manoranjan udyog ko glamras mafia chalaate hai
 Pahlaj Nihalani told IANS, "I am being targeted for candid views about the functioning of the censor board and because of me my prominent actor Govinda (govinda) is being targeted
 agar aap mujhase puuchhen to main kah saktaa hum ki govinda (govinda) or mere film udyog main sabase zyada dushman hai
 On the lack of theaters for "rangeela Raja" by Pahlaj Nihalani and Govinda (govinda), Nihalani said that he was refused to release the film in places like Bihar and Jharkhand
 unhone kaha, "ye govinda ke paaramparik garh rahe hai, jahaan ke log unki filmon ko bahut pasand karte hai
 Not a single cinema theater in Patna or Ranchi agreed to display 'rangeela Raja'
 kyon? kyonki meri film kharaab he? kya keval gunvattta vaali filmein hi cinemagharon main relies ho sakati hai? or kisne tay kiya ki meri film ghatiya he? mutthi bhar aalochak, jinke liye maine press sho nahin kiya
 So they were upset with me and they took revenge for it from my film
 "pehlaaj nihlani (pahlaj Nihalani) ne kaha, "mujhe pataa he ki ve koun hai
 i know people who want to eliminate Govinda and me
 manoranjan udyog ek glamras mafia chalaata he
 They all sit together, eat, sleep and make movies
 mere jaise tanaha nirmaataa, jiske peeche kisi korporate kaa haath nahin he, use korporate samskruti ke naam par film udyog se baahar kiya ja rahaa he

 Violence erupted between two communities in Aurangabad, Maharashtra last night
 raat bhar log yaa to dare sahame bhaagate rahe yaa updrav machaane vaale hinsa failaate daudte rahe
 Stoned, shops were burnt, cars were burnt
 or is dauraan kahin police kaa koi naamo nishaan nahin
 Special IG Milind Bharambe, who is taking charge of the commissioner of Aurangabad, told 'aaj Tak' that there was a rift between the two communities over the disconnection of water connection by the Gar Nigam, but due to the rumor-mongering, the estrangement took the form of violence
 philhal aurangabad ke puraane hisse sahit kai ilaakon main dhara 144 laga di gai he or badi sankhya main police bal tainaat kar diya gaya he
 The situation has been under control since Saturday morning, peace has been established, but the atmosphere is still tense
 aurangabad hinsa main ab tak do logon kii maut ho chuki he, jabaki ek bachche or 16 pulicekarmiyon sahit 41 log ghayal hue hai
 Please tell that for two months, the post of Commissioner in Aurangabad is vacant and Special IG Milind Bharambe is handling the additional charge of Commissioner
 beete do maheene se kamishnar kii niyukti na karne ko rajya sarkaar kii badi laaparvaahee ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 When Aaj Tak asked Milind Bharambe about the Aurangabad violence, he was seen giving clarification
 ajtak-raat bhar hinsa, aagjanee hoti rahi
 Where was your police during this? Milind Bharambe - There was some rift between two communities over a small issue, after which scuffles and stone pelting started taking place from both sides
 afvaah ke chalate yah hinsa aas-paas ke ilaakon main bhi fail gai
 Thereafter arson took place at one or two places
 afvaah ke chalate hinsa zyada faili
 But wherever necessary the situation was controlled by using appropriate force
 police ko jahaan jaisaa uchit laga uske anusaar, aansu gas ke gole chode gaye, lathicharge kiya or plastic bullate se fire kiya gaya
 Now the situation is completely under control
 ajtak-jis vyakti kii maut hui he, vah aapasi vivaad main hui yaa police kii golibari ke chalate?milind bharambe-jab bheed hinsak ho gaya to us par niyantran paane ke liye police ne plastic bullate se fire kiya, jo ek vyakti ko critical jagah ja lagi or hamerej ke chalate uski maut ho gai
 This is unfortunate
 ajtak-kya ghayalon main kuch gambhir bhi hai?milind bharambe-ghayalon main koi gambhir nahin he or sabhi kii haalat sthir he
 The injured are undergoing treatment in a government hospital
 ajtak-donon samudaayon ke bich tanaav khatm karne ki liye prashasan ne kya pahal kii he?milind bharambe-shanti bahaali ke liye donon samudaayon ke netaaon se baatcheet chal rahi he
 Precautionary measures are also being adopted
 donon samudaayon ke bich kuch chizon ko lekar manmutav kii sthiti he, jisaki jaanch kii ja rahi he
 Aajtak - Has the identity of the dead person been found? Milind Bharambe - It would not be right to reveal the identity of the dead person
 ajatak-donon samudaayon ke bich manmutav kii asli vajah kya he?milind bharambe-donon samudaayon ke bich kuch ishyus ko lekar afvaahen hai
 Rumors are still being investigated
 jaanch ke baad hi kuch kahana uchit hoga
 Nothing can be said before it is confirmed
 ajtak-kya hinsa bhadakaane kii suniyojit taiyaari thi?milind bharambe-jaanch ke baad hi pataa chal paaegaa ki danga failaane waalon kii kya taiyaari thi
 But nothing can be said before the investigation
 ajtak-aap kab se kamishnar kaa prabhaar sambhaal rahe hai
 Milind Bharambe-ji i am handling the charge of the Commissioner of the district and i have been handling this charge for the last two months

 You brought laurels to the nation with immense contribution # zakretires # zaksnewbeginning— Anjum Chopra (@chopraanjum)october 15, 2015 As the Lok Sabha elections came to a close, the apprehension that foreign interference could occur in Indian elections again
 FCRA act main badlaav se yah ashanka majboot hui he
 This apprehension cannot be called unnecessary because both the BJP and the Congress, the big political parties have received foreign donations of crores of rupees
 da association for democratic riforms (ADR) ko raajnneetik dalon ko videshi chanda milane ke aise 34 vaakye mili hai
 Between 2003-04 and 2011-12, 19 such cases were reported by BJP and 15 by Congress
 ye sabhi chande is vajah se milane sambhav ho sake kyonki sarkaar ne epasiare 2010 or 1976 main badlaav kar diya tha
 Vedanta's Indian subsidiary, Dow Chemicals, Hyatt from foreign companies to both political parties from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 14
 5 karod rupee tak mili hai
 a total of 19 BJP from foreign sources in these years
 4 karod rupee or congress ko 9
 83 crores has been received
 is tarah kii funding ko rokna kyon jaruri hairaajnneetik dalon ko loktantr kaa rakshak mana jaataa he
 They contest elections, form governments and make laws
 isliye unako milane vaala chanda hamaare loktantr or sarkaar ke sanchaalan ke lihaaj se kaaphi mahatv rakhata he
 The Law Commission, in its 2015 report on Election Reforms, gave three major reasons why it is important to bring about reform and transparency in the funding system of political parties
 pehali baat to yah he ki mani power raajnneetik dalon main barabari ke mukaable kii vyavastha ko baadhit karata he or raajnneetik dalon kii shuddhta ko patit karata he
 Wealthy candidates and political parties have a greater chance of winning elections
 doosraa, kaale dhan, ghoosekhori or len-dein vaale bhrashtachar kaa raajnneeti main pehle se hi vyapak bolbalaa he jisase pratyaashiyon ko apane chunaav abhiyaan chalaane main madad milti he
 The commission had made the premise of the Supreme Court's quote to substantiate its view, 'it seems that the source of some electoral funds is unaccounted criminal money which they get protection in return
 isi prakaar isamen kaarobaari samoohon kaa kaala dhan bhi hota he, jo is nivesh, ghoose yaa thekon par die gaye kamishan ke badale ooncha ritern milane kii ummid rakhte hai
 Third, uncontrolled or less controlled electoral funding promotes two things

 Currently, this file will be sent to the new LG Anil Baijal of Delhi for approval on Monday

 The file was sent to LG Najeeb Jung, but the old LG refused to pass the file saying that the committee was created without his permission
 'kejarivalane iske saath hi bataaya ki filhal nunatam mazdooree badhaane ko lekar nai kamity banaai he, jise somvaar ko nae alji ke paas apruval ke liye bheja jayega

 He said that after the survey of the new committee, the minimum wage now is a difference of 600 to 700 rupees, because the prices of food were very low then
 arvind kejariwal ne bataaya ki vah nunatam mazdooree ke maamle ko lekar jald hi alji anil baijal se mulaaqaat bhi karenge, taaki mazdooron ko holi kaa tohfa mil sake

 After this, on 23 June 2017, the Commission had ordered a written reply from the mlas
 kuch vidhayakon ne to jawaab bheje lekin kuch ne ab tak jawaab nahin bheje hai
 The Commission has asked to send the documents received from the office of the Secretary to the Government of Delhi and any other supporting documents
 taaki is bare main karrwai tej kii ja sake
 During this time, the legalists, who were in the legal circle, declared themselves innocent and said that they did not know that this post was of benefit
 unhone is pad par rahete hue koi laabh nahin liya
 Now the Commission has given the last chance to these mlas to give their written reply to the Commission in five copies

 - It is believed that pregnant women should not do any work during this period
 -manyata he ki surya grahan ke dauraan kuch bhi khaanaa nahin chahie
 - It is said that food should not be prepared during solar eclipse
 -kaha jaataa he ki jab bhi surya grahan laga ho, to us dauraan kapade nahin silne chahie, na hi sooyee kaa istemaal karnaa chahie
 -hindu religion holds that sharp things should not be used during eclipse
 - surya grahan ke baad snaan karne kii bhi manyata he
 Pregnant women, elderly, patients and children
 saath hi grahan ke dauraan khaanaa khaane or pakaane ko bhi manaa kiya jaataa he
 Some people even wash their houses with water
 manyata he ki grahan ke baad man kii shuddhi ke liye daan-punya bhi karnaa chahie

 Solar Eclipse 2019 In India Date and Time: yah surya grahan bhartiya samyaanusaar aaj raat 10 bajkar 25 minute par lageganshri Sri Tattva Panchakarma main senior doctor mitali madhusmita kahati hai ki grahan shuru hone ke pehle yaa khatm hone ke baad ke do ghanton main aap kuch bhi kha sakate hai
 Bacteria are very active when there are no sun rays
 jo khaane ke poshak tatwon ko prabhavit kar sakate hai or aapaki sehat ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Not only this, cooking should also be avoided during this period
 lekin is baat kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie ki biimaar logon ko is dauraan puri tarah se upwas bhi nahin rakhana chahie
 1
 koun rakh saktaa he upwas? ve log jo biimaar hai yaa jo bujurg hai unhen is dauraan upwas nahin karnaa chahie
 But they can take light satvic food during this period
 jo pachne main aasaan ho or pet ke liye bhi halke hon
 During this time, you can take dry fruits in food
 yah kam maatra main khaane par bhi sharir ko puri energy denge
 2
 pani pi sakate hai? mitali kahati hai ki is dauraan pani pine se bhi bachanaa chahie
 Because bacteria are active due to lack of sun rays
 doctor madhusmita kehete hai -'' agar aap biimaar hai yaa aap garbhvatee hai to aap halkaa garm pani pi sakate hai
 You can boil 8-10 drops of basil juice or leaves
 iske saath hi agar aap sada pani nahin pinaa chaahate to nariyal kaa pani pi sakate hai
 It would be best to drink a good amount of water before the eclipse

 isro's trusted sources have confirmed this
 isro chif dow
 K
 sivan ne kaha tha ki chandrayan-2 mishan ke baad is saal ve ek or bada mishan launch karenge
 His reference was towards Cartosat-3
 haalanki, jab yah mishan (cartosat-3) launch hoga tab isse desh ke dushmano ke hosh ud jaaenge
 The reason for its delay is the disturbances in the Chandrayaan-2 mission
 kaha ja rahaa he ki abhi isro kii ek badi or mahatvapurn team vikram lander se sampark sthapit karne main lagi he, isliye cartosat-3 kii lonching main thodi bahut deree ho sakati he
 Let us tell you that with the help of Cartosat-1 and 2, our forces carried out surgical strikes and Balakot Airstrikes in Pakistan

 Not 1 KM, 335 meters was broken by isro's contact with Vikram, this graph is proof that the work of this satellite would be to monitor India's land from space
 aapadaaon main or dhanchaagat vikaas ke liye madad karnaa lekin iskaa upyog desh kii simaaon kii nigaraanee ke liye bhi hoga
 This mission will be the most powerful eye of the country to keep an eye on Pakistan and its terrorist camps
 yah simaaon par najar rakhegi
 If enemies or terrorists dodge, with the help of this eye, our army will enter them and kill them
 ye kaisaa inaam? Chandrayaan-2 se pehle sarkaar ne kaati ISRO vaigyanikon kii tankhwaahie
 
 
 Do you know which satellite is this and how much is its strength? The name of this satellite is - Cartosat-3 (cartosat-3)
 yah cartosat siries kaa nauvaan satellite hoga
 Cartosat-3's camera is so powerful that it is less than 1 feet from ground to space (9
 84 inch) kii oonchai tak kii tasviir le sakegaa
 That is, you will also give accurate information about the exact time shown on the watch tied on your wrist
 bataa den ki pakistan par hue sargical or air strike par cartosat upgrahon kii madad lee gai thi
 Also able to take pictures of the Earth in different types of weather
 prakritik aapadaaon main madad karegaa
 Orbiter of Chandrayaan-2 was for 1 year, know how Kamadunia will be the strongest satellite camera in the world for 7 years
 Cartosat-3 camera in Cartosat-3 is so powerful that it is 0 on the ground from space
 25 meter yani 9
 Can take clear pictures up to 84 inch height
 sambhawatah abhi tak itani sateekta vaala satellite camera kisi desh ne launch nahin kiya he

 ) On the foundation day of the Bharatiya Janata Party on 6 April, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis surprisingly praised the late Bal Thackeray
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ve hamaari party se nahin the, lekin hindutv ko praasangik banaae rakhane main unke yogadan kaa mujhe ullekh karnaahoga
 Four days later, Fadnavis once again referred to the founder of Shiv Sena in a newspaper program
 unhone shivasena ke mukhpatr saamana ke kaaryakari sampadak sanjay raut se kaha, ‘‘jab bhi tathakthith secular partiyaan ek saath hoti hai to hindutvvaadi partiyon ko bhi haath milaanaa chahie
 This was the thinking of Balasaheb Thackeray
 ’’janvari menshivsenapramukh uddhav thakare ke agle saal loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav akele ladgaye ke elaan ke baad se hi mukhyamantri ke sur or shabd saaf taur par mail-milaap vaale dikh rahe hai
 Not only is Fadnavis paying much attention to the grievances of the Shiv Sena mlas, but it seems that the BJP national president has also softened his anti-shiv Sena voice
 amit shah ne 6 april ko mumbai main kaha, ‘‘ham aglaa chunaav ek saath laduya chaahate hai
 If the experts are to be believed, these are indications that there is increasing disinformation in the BJP to re-establish an alliance with the Shiv Sena
 sattarudh bhaajapa ke karaae gaye ek survey se sanket mila he ki party rajya kii sirf 88 siton par hi aage rahegi
 Party sources say that if elections are held today, the party will lose 44 seats
 iske ulat survey kahata he ki chunaav purv gathbandhan ban jane par bhaajapa 110 or shivasena 65 siton par jeet sakati he
 But it also has a different picture: If the saffron alliance is not formed, the Congress can win 80 seats in the state
 isliye mukhyamantri fadavis ne uddhav ke saath baatcheet karne kii jimmedaari rajya ke vitt mantri sudhir mungantiwar ko saunpi he
 It is believed that this month when Mungantiwar will meet the Shiv Sena chief, he will present a new formula of seat sharing
 iske alaava ek prastaav yah bhi he ki vidhansabha ke aane vaale monsoon satr ko mumbai kii jagah up-rajdhani nagpur main yojit kiya jaae
 Mungantiwar is confident that both parties will "soon find a solution to all the issues"
 ’’bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai ki yah bharosa ek nae seat saajhedaari samjhaute kii vajah se bana he, jisamen bhaajapa kuch siten chhodie or kuch main badlaav ke liye taiyaar he
 According to him, the previous arrangement of 26 seats for BJP and 22 seats for Shiv Sena for Lok Sabha will continue
 yah bhi ki vidhansabha chunaav ke liye bhaajapa un 122 siton par to apana daawa barkaraar rakhegi jo abhi uske paas hai, lekin 18 anya koun-si siton par bhaajapa apane pratyaashee utaare, ise tay karne kaa adhikaar vah shivasena ko degi
 Apart from this, there is also a promise to give Shiv Sena a 'head' ministry at the Center and the state
 shivasena zyada se zyada mol-bhav karne kii koshish karegi
 Uddhav has publicly reiterated his decision that the party will contest the elections alone and Raut has also claimed that there is indeed no possibility of re-forming an alliance with the BJP
 gathbandhan na ho paaya to bhaajapa main log iske liye taiyaar baithe hai ki ek jabardast soshal media campan chalaakar shivasena pramukh ko ‘hindutv virdohi’ ke rup main pesh kiya jaae
 Uddhav's growing close association with West Bengal's so-called 'pro-muslim' Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is not being liked
 sena kaa netritv yah bhi jaanata he ki bhaajapa netritv shivasena ke niyantran vaali brihan mumbai mahanagar palika (biemasi) main vyaapt ‘vyapak bhrashtachar’ ke khilaaf nae sire se abhiyaan shuru karne main hichkichaayegaa nahin
 On April 10, Fadnavis indicated to what extent he could go for an electoral alliance with the Shiv Sena
 ve bole, ‘‘uddhav shivesna ke netaa ho sakate hai, par yah aisi party he jo bala sahab ke vichaaron par chalati he

 police kaa kahana he ki maangi gai soochna sthaneey khufia beuro (LIB) se sambandhit he, jo RTI ke daayre main nahin aata he
 Jasodaben asked for information on his security, SP JR Mothalia of Memehsana district said, "the information sought by him (jasodaben) is related to the local intelligence bureau, so it could not be given to him
" hamane is ghatnakram ke bare main unhen chitthee bhej di he

 rahu kii gananaa surya or chandra ke aadhaar par kii jaati he
 If the Sun is Prana then the Moon is the mind, Rahu is the secret of this mind and life
 rahu kaa sahyogi ketu mukti or moksh kaa dwaar khol saktaa he
 It can open all the known unknown mysteries of life and hence it is also called mysterious planet
 purvajanm se kis tarah ke karm or sanskaar aap lekar aaye hai or jivan par uskaa kya prabhaav hoga, yah baat kundali main rahu ke adhyayan se jaani ja sakati he
 You can get rid of unknown obstacles only by understanding the relationship between Rahu's previous birth and present birth
 rahu ke alag-alag bhav ke prabhaav kya hai?- agar rahu kundali ke pratham bhav main ho to vyakti paariwarik jivan kii samasyaon kaa saamnakarna padataa he, kyonki usne apane parivarik jivan kii keemat nahin samajhi he
 - If Rahu is in the second house of the horoscope then the person is afraid, because he has misused his powers before
 - agar rahu tritiy bhav main ho to vyakti dussahsee hota he , or isi kaaran se kabhi kabhi bheeshan durghatnaon kaa shikaar bhi hota he
 - If Rahu is in the fourth house then the person never gets happiness because earlier he has only given grief to the people
 - agar rahu pancham bhav main ho to santan hone main yaa santan kii taraf se pidaa hoti he kyonki pehle usne mata-pita kaa sammaan nahin kiya
 - Rahu of the sixth house makes the person very rich because the person has done a lot of religious work and charity in the previous birth
 - agar rahu saptam bhav main ho to vyakti ko jivan main kaaphi utaar chadhaav kaa saamana karnaa padataa he , kyonki usne purv janm main dhan or sampatti kii keemat nahin samajhi thi
 - If Rahu is in the eighth house then the person takes birth for a particular purpose, which is left from the previous birth
 aamtaur par aise logon kaa janm or mrityu aakasmik hi ho jaataa he
 - If Rahu is in the 9th house then the person's religion is corrupt, he does not give luck because he has not followed religion before and has created problems for the society
 - dasham bhav kaa rahu vyakti ko oonchai par pahuchataa he parantu paariwarik sukh nahin detaa kyonki inhone keval pad pratishtha kii kaamana kii hoti he , anya kisi bhi chiz kii nahin
 - Rahu in the eleventh house leads the person towards disinterest, and is generally resolved to take the trouble of the world
 - dwadash bhav kaa rahu vyakti ko durgun tathaa kumarg par le jaataa he , or ye sanskaar purv janm se chale aate hai
 If Rahu is overshadowed by previous births on this birth, then what are the remedies? damdaar aawaaj ke maalik superstar amitabh bachchan ne ravivaar ko bharat or pakistan ke bich yahaan vishwacap cricket match ke dauraan camentry kii

 Patil is one of the thousands of so-called business correspondents or local bank representatives in the country, who are taking banking from door to door

 The Reserve Bank has said that under financial inclusion, people should be given financial information along with access to banking and loans
 vaise to abhi yah nayaa concept he, phir bhi desh main do lakh se zyada bijness corespondents ho chuke hai jinamein utani hi vividhta he jitani unke gramin graahakon main: ve karcenter, skool teacher, clerk, kisaan yaa ashikshit gramin aurat kuch bhi ho sakate hai
 Take the example of Dagdu Kisan Sutar, a 28-year-old carpenter from Mahavade village
 shahar main nirmaan udyog main kuch samay tak kaam karne ke baad sootar gaanv laut aae or kareeb saat maheene pehle hi ve ek banking corespondent bane hai
 His decision has proved prudent: the nearest bank branch is about 10 km from Mahadev's house, situated in the traditional rural houses with slums and colorful paintings
 sootar ke paas 70 graahak hai or jab ve apane ghar ke paas bani apni work shop main karcenter kaa kaam nahin kar rahe hote, us samay in graahakon kii banking jaruraton ko puraa karte hai
 Many business correspondents are engaged in two or more jobs, but some are making a living from it

 For the first few years he was a non-medical staff at a private school in Kesla town
 iske baad unhone sthaneey yuvaaon ko computer kii shiksha dene ke liye computer centre kholaa
 About two years ago, he saw a State Bank of India advertisement in a local newspaper for the need of a business correspondent in his tribal-dominated district
 iske baad kai baar unki phone par baat hui or yadav training camp main pahunch gaye jahaan unhone yah siikhaa ki aakhir kis tarah se khaataa kholaa jaae or fingerprint pahchaanane vaali biomitric mashin ko chalaaya jaae
 In Hoshangabad, he started working among the local population: first he used to go to the village with the employees of State Bank of India conducting awareness campaigns
 baad main ve khud hi zyada se zyada graahakon ko deal karne lage
 Yadav's efforts are paying off: Today they are providing banking services to about 7,200 customers
 kya unke graahak diposit or vidrol (nikasi) yaa byaaj ko samajhate hai? yadav bataate hai ki pehle ve samaj nahin pate the, lekin ab samaj jate hai
 It does not take long for them to learn how to withdraw or deposit cash from a card
 ve bataate hai ki unke paas aane vaale zyaadaatar log majdoor hote hai jo paisa nikaalnaa chaahate hai
 Only about one-quarter of people deposit money, often Rs 100 to 200
 jaisi maamuli raashi
 Malkhan Singh, business correspondent in Panna district of Madhya Pradesh, says that it takes at least a year to talk about the benefits of banking in the minds of customers
 kisaan parivaar se aane vaale malakhan ne bataaya ki ve panna kii 20 panchayaton ke har gaanv main jate hai or logon ko banking ke phaayde samajhate hai
 But being a business correspondent is not a very lucrative business: they sometimes earn a meager amount of 50 paise on a single transaction and there is no scope to increase the transaction too much due to low income in rural areas
 lekin log kai anya vajahon se is kaam ke prati aakarshith ho rahe hai
 Archana Yuvraj Rohile of Mahavade village is not bothered by low transactions

 The people of the village call me Madam, because i tell them what they should do
 sarkaar ne logon ke phaayde ke liye hi hamen niyukt kiya he, isliye main yah karti hum
 The villagers say that banking correspondents have changed their lives
 dur-daraaj ke bahut se ilaakon main koi bank nahin he or aabaadi ke chote se hisse ke hi bank khate hai
 Before this, only pygmy agents or agents of small branches of banks were the only sources of contact for banks
 agar gaanv ke kuch log agent se nahin mil pate to unke paas is baat ke alaava or koi chaara nahin hota tha ki agali baar agent ke aane kaa intjaar karen

 pehle muthaiya muralidharan or duusare shen worne
 Murali took 1347 wickets, while Warne did not progress beyond the 1001 mark

 i felt that the dispute is because the day is for teachers, but why is the Prime Minister addressing the children because November 14 has not come for them
 shikshak diwas ke din chaatr apane−apane shikshakon se milte hai, unhen card dete hai, unka shukriya adaa karte hai or kai shikshak bhavuk hokar ghar bhi lautate hai ki aaj chaatro se kitna sneh or sammaan mila
 This time there is a dispute that on Teachers' Day, the Prime Minister will forcibly sit the students and give a speech and in preparation for this, the teacher will be engaged throughout the day
 raajnneeti main samvaad ek jaays tarika he or pradhanmantri samvaad karte rahen to dikkat kya he? pehle us circular par ek nazar jise lekar vivaad hua
 The Directorate of Education of the Government of Delhi issued instructions to the Government and private schools of Delhi on 29 August
 patr main nirdesh shabd kaa hi istemaal hua he
 That the Prime Minister will address the children of the country from three o'clock in the afternoon to five o'clock and the question will be answered
 iskaa prasaaran doordarshan ke rashtriya or kshetreey channelon se hoga
 It is written in the letter that the instruction of the Union Ministry of Human Resources is that schools across the country will have to make such a system so that children can watch the live telecast of the Prime Minister's speech
 isliye saare bacchon ko pradhanmantri ke kaarykram se ek ghanta pehle yani dhai baje se paune paanch baje tak ke liye ikattha karnaa hoga
 On this day all government schools will have the same shift
 vah bhi ek se saadhe paanch baje tak
 Private schools can choose between 8 am and 5 pm on September 5, or choose from 1 am to 5:30 pm depending on their resources
 skulon ke pramukhon ko paryaapt sankhya main tivi set-top box, emplifaayar, projector, jenerator set, inwarter kaa intazaam karnaa hoga taaki chaatr piem kaa bhaashan dekh-sun saken
 The cost for this in government schools will be filled with VKS funds
 wikees yani vidhyalay kalyaan samiti ke fund se
 All district education directorates will have to report on September 2 by 5 pm
 saare pradhanacharyon ko nirdesh diya jaataa he ki ve abhibhavakon or mata−pita ko isaki jaankaree de den
 Writing in the school diary, via SMS, writing on the notice board, etc
 mid-de mile bhi dedh se do baje ke bich diya jayega or isaki soochna mid-de mile waalon ko pehle se de di jaae
 Members of the School Management Committee may also be called upon for this program if needed
 saare pradhanacharyon ko yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki bhaashan ke sidhe prasaaran ke dauraan skulon main anushaasan bana rahe
 Before the program starts, principals have to give details of how many students are watching from the online module
 sabhi didii shiksha adhikari, up shiksha adhikari jab bhaashan chal rahaa hoga, tab skulon kaa daura karenge yah dekhne ke liye ki jaisaa kaha gaya he, vaisaa paalan ho rahaa he yaa nahin
 If there is any negligence, it will be taken seriously

 Today, Union Human Resource Minister Smriti Irani has said that the instructions were not issued, whereas in the letter of the Delhi government, it is written that the instructions have come from the Ministry of Human Resources
 kendriya mantri ne kaha he, 'main yahi kahana chaahati hum ki yah gatividhi puri tarah se svaichhik he
 If there is any misunderstanding on this issue and it is being politicized then it is regrettable
 ' Rajshri Bhattacharya, Secretary, Union Ministry of Human Resources has written a letter in this regard to the education secretaries of the states
 is khat main zarur yah likhaa he ki saare skool 'may make' arrangement yani saare skool chahen to aisa prabandh kar sakate hai taaki bachche pradhanmantri ke bhaashan kaa sidhaa prasaaran dekh saken
 In remote areas, where there is no TV or signal, radio sets should be arranged
 isamen yahi likhaa he ki kaarykram ke turant baad feedback liya jayega ki kitne bachche upasthit hue kitne skulon ne prambandh kiya isaki puri report rajyon ko bhejni hogi

 pashchim bengal shiksha mantri partha chatarji ne kaha he ki hamen bhi nirdesh mili hai magar ham paalan nahin karenge
 The state government will follow its programs
 maharashtra main skulon kaa kahana he ki ganesh chaturthi ke kaaran chaar sitambar tak rajya ke skool band hai, isliye intazaam karnaa mushkil he
 Also there is a code of conduct
 bihar ke shiksha mantri vrushan patel ne circular kaa swaagat karte hue sabhi afasaron ko har sambhav koshish karne ke nirdesh die hai, lekin unki salaah he ki pradhanmantri ko chaatro se mulaaqaat 14 november ko bal diwas par kerani chahie thi
 He says that this is a half-hearted attempt to become Chacha Modi like Chacha Nehru


 madhya pradesh ke schuli shiksha mantri kaa kahana he ki nijee skulon ke paas suvidhaayen hai, isliye unhen dikkat nahin hogi
 But as far as the government schools, that too the schools in far-flung areas are concerned, this is a big challenge and we are doing everything possible
 congress party ne etraz jataayaa he ki nirdesh jari kar jabaran bacchon ko bithakar bhaashan sunaaya ja rahaa he
