 mangalvaar ko supreme cart ne hatyaron kii maut kii sajaa ko umr kaid main badal diya tha, jiske baad buudhvaar ko tamilnadu sarkaar ne doshiyon ko reeha karne kaa faisla liya tha
 On this, Rahul Gandhi had expressed his displeasure and said that when the pm's killers are left in the country, how will the common man get justice

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi said on Friday that his wish was not 'soft Hindutva'
 hamaare mandir jane sebijepico pareshaani hoti he, kyonki vah har cheez par apana ekadhikaar chaahati he
 He said that 'ideological war' is going on in the country at the moment and the center of this ideological battle against the Union is the Congress

 i think BJP is troubled by such things
 unhen lagata he ki sirf wo hi mandir ja sakate hai
 He said, 'there is a difference between Hinduism and Hinduism
 hindu dharm ek darshan he, lekin hindutv ek raajnneetik vichaardhaara he
 This (going to the temple) is not soft Hindutva
 mujhe samaj nahin aata ki main mandir kyon nahin ja saktaa? main gurudwara, girjaghar or masjid kyon nahin ja saktaa? agar mujhe koi aamantrit karata he or main nahin jaataa hum to yah unka apmaan hoga
 'rahul said,' BJP feels that this (going to temple) is their monopoly
 ve har santhaan par apana adhikaar chaahate hai
 This is not the nature of India

 3 billion people have fantasies and you cannot suppress these fantasies

 The RSS that defines the bjp's ideology is the RSS
 bijepi jin mukhya vichaaron ke liye lard rahi he, unki unhen samaj nahin he
 The RSS understands this because these are his views
 duusari taraf, kai nazariye hai or ve aresas ke khilaaf ladaai lard rahe hai
 The Congress Party is its ideological center
 'unhone kaha ki congress apane aap main khud ek vichaardhaara he
 This ideology is about connecting, communicating and taking everyone together
 yahi vichaar he jisase ab tak bharat safal rahaa he
 Asked whether the Congress also wants to make cadres like the RSS, Gandhi said that his party never wants such cadres
 unhone kaha ki congress kabhi bhi aresas kii tarah cader nahin bana sakati or bananaa bhi nahin chahie
 The purpose of RSS cadre system is to capture the institutions of India
 ham aisa nahin chaahate
 Even if we want, we cannot do it because our thought is not like that

 In this program, Rahul fiercely targeted the Narendra Modi government regarding the state of the economy, NPA, unemployment, demonetisation, GST, foreign policy and security policy and alleged that this government does not believe in dialogue, only wants to impose its words

 Recently while addressing an election meeting in Tamil Nadu, Kamal Haasan said that Azad was the first militant Hindu of India
 yah baat unhone mahatma gandhi kii hatya karne vaale nathuram godse ke bare main kahi thi
 Kamal Haasan made this remark during the election meeting in the area which was Muslim dominated
 aswani upaadhyaay ne apni arji main kaha ki netaaon ke is tarah ke bayanon par turant roak lagaae jane kii jarurat he
 The petitioner also told the court during the hearing that the Election Commission has also been made aware of this 2 days ago but no action has been taken by the Election Commission so far
 haalanki court kii taraf se yachikakarta se yah bhi poocha gaya ki vah kis haisiyat se is maamle main yachika laga rahe hai
 At the same time, because the matter is from Tamil Nadu, this petition should be heard in the Madras High Court instead of the Delhi High Court
 haalanki hoicourt ne is yachika ko khaarij karte hue aswani upaadhyaay ke jariye chunaav ayog ko bheji gai shikaayat par jald se jald karrwai karne kaa nirdesh jarur diya he
 Explain that Kamal Haasan's remarks during the elections are not the first and last remarks, but in the speeches, almost all leaders of all parties are including objectionable things related to religion and caste in their speeches

 The Indian team, which has been the king of one-day cricket for some time, will try to maintain the top position in the rankings by maintaining its dominance in the seven-match series against Australia starting here on Sunday
 bharat ne is saal ekadivasiy praaroop main bahut achche parinaam hasil kiye
 He lost a three-match series to Pakistan in early 2013, but the world champion team continued success after that
 ab uskaa muqabla us australia se he, jise usne farvari march main test siries main 4-0 se karaari shikast di thi
 The Australian team has visited India without captain Michael Clarke, but their batsmen did well in the only T20 match at Rajkot
 australia ne bhale hi ashes main haar ke baad england ko vanade main parajeet kiya ho, lekin bharat ko gharelu paristhitiyon main haraana bahut mushkil hoga
 The Australian team could not defend the score of more than 200 runs in Rajkot and hence realized that it would be difficult for them
 bhartiya team main vaapasi karne vaale yuvaraj singh ne 35 gend par 77 ran thokkar australian akraman kii dhajjiyaan uda di thim

 garbhashay cancer kii jaanch ke liye mahilaon ko apni screening kar paanaa ab zyada aasaan ho jayega
 The Indian American professor and his team have created a device through which anyone can do their screening with just one click

 Women can do their own screening at the University of North Carolina at Duke University, researcher Nimmi Ramanujam and her team have named this device the 'pocket colposcope'

 Screening at single touch point, he said that the death toll from uterine cancer should be zero because we have all the facilities and we can see it
 iskaa ilaaj kar sakate hai
 But this is not happening
 unhone kaha ki mahilaon ke liye colposcopy ko laana jaruri tha
 Through this, the entire complex process can be transformed into a single touch point
 garbhashay cancer kii maujuuda prakriya kaaphi jatilramanujam ne kaha ki maujuuda samay main garbhashay cancer ke screening puri prakriya kaaphi jatil he
 This requires a speculum (a metal device through which the vaginal walls are stretched)
 saath hi colposcope ( yah ek magnyphoid divaais hoti he, jisamen camera laga hota he taaki medical profeshnal garbhashay ko dekh sake) ke saath ucch shikshit profeshnal kii jarurat hoti he
 So that better results can be achieved in the test
 camera or lite se las he divisis divaais ko taiyaar karne ke liye america ke neshnal institute of health (enech) ne funding kii he
 The device is designed as a pocket size tampon, with a camera and light at one end
 isamen ek insrter bhi he, jiske jariye colposcope ko yoni ke andar kar diya jaataa he
 This entire process is painless
 nimmi ne kaha ki enech se atirikt fund kii maang kii he
 The device is expected to get regulatory clearance by the end of 2017

 The Samajwadi Party (SP), which has been supporting the UPA government from outside, joined the Left parties on the issue of Food Security Bill on Monday and said that it is anti-farmer and will deprive them of proper payment
 sapa netaa naresh agarwal ne kaha, ‘jis din yah vidheyak kriyanvit kiya jayega us din kisaanon ko apane utpaada kaa samuchit bhugtan nahin milegaa
 He feared that by bringing this bill, the government is looking towards mid-term elections
 unhone kaha, ‘sapa is vidheyak kaa virodh karti he kyonki yah kisaan virdohi he
 Opposing the present form of the Bill, the Left parties demanded that the amendments brought by them should be considered 'seriously'
 makapa netaa vrinda karaat ne kaha, ‘is par charchaa honi chahie or party dwaara laae gaye sanshodhano par gambhirthapurvak vichaar kiya janaa chahie
 Strongly opposing the idea of bringing an ordinance on food security, the CPI said that the Food Security Bill in its present form is 'flawed and unacceptable' and needs to be changed after extensive discussion
 bhakpa ke di raja ne kaha ki upie sarkaar dwaara laayaa ja rahaa khaadya suraksha vidheyak vartmaan swaroop main asweekaarya he kyonki isamen kai khamiyaan hai

 Efforts for solidarity in the opposition to remove the NDA government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi from power in 2019 have intensified
 tisare morcha banane kii kavayad ko lekar pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee sakriy hai
 Mamta met all the leaders of opposition parties in Delhi and then met former Congress president Sonia Gandhi
 sonia se mulaakaat ke baad modi ko haraane ke liye mamata ne 2019 ke liye van-tu-van fite kaa formula diya
 The party has not given any indication as to whether or not this formula of Mamta came to Sonia Gandhi and Congress, but according to political experts, the Congress led by Rahul may not accept this formula of Mamta
 mamata ne sonia se mulaakaat ke bare main kaha, 'maine unase kaha ki jo party jahaan majboot he, vahaan usko damadari se ladanaa chahie
 We want Congress to help regional parties to compete with BJP
 yah aamane-saamne kii ladaai hi bhartiya janata party ko khatm karegi
 Disgruntled BJP leader Arun Shourie said that Modi can be easily defeated with the One to One formula
 talmail or seat bantwaare kaa jimmaa rajya ke bade majboot netaa ko diya jaae
 The opposition should have a target of 69 percent of the vote against Modi
 mamata ke van-tu-van formule ke mutabik upi main espi-bispi, bihar main lalu kii argedy, maharashtra main ensipi
 The DMK is dominated by the DMK in Tamil Nadu and in West Bengal itself
 upi main 80 loksabhaa, pashchim bengal main 42, bihar main 40, maharashtra main 48 or tamilnadu main 39 siten hai
 That is, on almost half the seats, Mamata wants the Congress to surrender to local parties
 ye sahi he ki congress in paanchon rajyon main junior partner(sapa, basapa, tiemasi, vamadal, argedy or diemke) he
 In such a situation, the possibilities for him are quite limited here
 mamata ke formule ko sweekaar kiya to congress yahaan kshetreey dalon kii marji par nirbhar rahegi
 The question arises that if the Congress accepts this formula then what will be its benefit
 jin duusare rajyon main wo akele ladane vaali he jaise karnataka, uttarakhand, madhyapradesh, chhattisgarh, rajasthan, gujarat vahaan ye chote dal use koi phayda nahin pahunchaayenge
 Then why would the Congress sacrifice its prospects for states without influence of these parties? vidhansabha chunaav main to vaise hi kshetreey dalon kaa bolbalaa rahata he, party kaa gandhi brands loksabhaa main hi kuch dam dikhaa paata he agar party loksabhaa chunaav main bhi in dalon ke junior partner kii tarah rahi to uske rivival kii ummiden hameshaa ke liye khatm ho jaaenge
 It does not appear that the party will take this risk regarding its future
 darasal congress bhi inhen kshatrapon ko 2019 main ekajute karke modi ke khilaaf chunaav maidan main utarane kii kavayad kar rahi he
 But the Congress wants to lead it not as a junior partner but as the strongest party in the coalition
 aise main congress ke mansoobon se ulataa mamata kaa formula he
 Obviously, it will not be easy for the Congress to accept this

 With this, the speculation of Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra contesting from Varanasi Lok Sabha seat of Congress has ended
 isse pehle priyanka gandhi ke varanasi seat se chunaav ladane kii baat kahi ja rahi thi
 Now on this issue, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has attacked Priyanka Gandhi and the politics of dynasty
 guuruuvaar ko arun jetali ne apane blog main likhaa, 'priyanka gandhi ke daawey kaa myth tut gaya he
 India's traditional smartness - a closed handful of lakhs, opened up a blank
 abhi tak yah myth tha ki priyanka gandhi ke raajnneeti main aane se fark padegaa
 Today this myth has lost its importance
 'the myths of Priyanka Gandhi stands demolished
 India's traditional wisdom has been 'bandh fist lakh ki, khoon khuk khaq ki'
 The Myth of ‘priyanka will make a difference’ was worth a lakh
 Today, the myth has lost its value

 Jaitley said that Priyanka Gandhi has been in public life for the last two months
 congress kii vanshavaad kii raajnneeti par nishaanaa sadhate hue bijepi netaa ne kaha ki bharat badal gaya he or ab vanshavaad koi myne nahin rakhata he
 With Priyanka Gandhi not contesting elections, it is clear what dynasty means? Jaitley said, 'I only hoped that Varanasi would give new India an opportunity to decide the fate of new political dynasty against a successful politician
 ' varanasi main pichley 5 varshon main hue vikaas ko dekhte hue gandhi parivaar ko aatmanirikshan karnaa chahie ki unhone 40 se adhik varshon main amethi or raibareli main kya kiya he? aaj kaa nayaa bharat vanshavaad ko khaarij kar uplabdhiyon main vishwaas karata he
 Priyanka Gandhi's passion in 'our Family' reflects the mentality of the Congress party
 'the Gandhis must introspect the plight of Amethi and Raebareli in the last forty years and compare it to what the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has done in Varanasi in the past five years
 Even a casual visitor to Varanasi would tell you the difference

 This Vidhan Sabha constituency comes under Durg district, but Motilal Sahu is not a resident of Patan assembly constituency
 wo durg main rahete hai
 Activists say that it would have been better if the party had nominated any leader from the same region, but ignoring the local leaders, the BJP high command imposed an external candidate on them, threatening the resignation of the leaders of 4 mandals, calling Motilal Sahu an external candidate

 party ko dar is baat kaa he ki yadi bagawati tevar apnaane vaale kaaryakartaaon par lagaam nahin lagaai gai to uskaa khamiyaja bhugatna padegaa
 Chief Minister Raman Singh has himself taken over the responsibility of persuading the angry activists

 However, a committee of half a dozen leaders has also been formed to handle the damage control at the party level

 According to Congress spokesperson Jayveer Shergill, the first priority is to overthrow the BJP government
 unke kaaryakartaaon ko ve yahi sandesh de rahe he
 AAP and Janata Congress have also created a ruckus in the changed candidates Congress and BJP besides Aam Aadmi Party, BSP, Samajwadi Party and Janata Congress
 kaaryakartaaon kii maang par aap party ne paanch vidhansabha siton par apane ummidavaar tak badal die hai to samaajawaadee party or janata congress ne bhi apane aadha darjan ghoshit ummidavaaron ko badalakar unke sthaan par nae pratyaashee maidan main utaare hai

 As soon as the results of the Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections came on December 23, it seemed that the barometer of public meetings had knocked out the People's Democratic Party (PDP)
 bijepi ko 25 siten milane se uske belgaum josh ko saanp soongh gaya
 The victory in just 28 seats shocked the PDP so much that it was also hesitant to celebrate its emergence as the largest party in the state
 nateezon se 24 ghante pehle pidipi ko puraa bharosa tha ki rajya main agali sarkaar uski banegi
 Now it is a matter of relief that the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley stopped the bjp's victory chariot at the Jawahar tunnel

 6 pratishat vot aae
 The National Conference won just 15 seats but 20
 7 pratishat vot le gai
 Congress won 12 seats but got 6 votes

 There were also reports that he was badly injured in the airstrike on 18 March 2015 and was undergoing treatment for his spine

 Following the public apology of former Delhi minister Kapil Mishra, former AAP leader Yogendra Yadav wrote an open letter to him
 yadav ne kaha ki mujhase maafee maangane ke bajaay aapako hajaaron samarthakon or deshavaasiyon se maafee maangani chahie thi
 At the same time, he also advised Kapil to stop accusing Kejriwal every day
 yogendra yadav ke is patr ke baad kapil ne bhi jawaab diya
 He said that till the information of the scams is revealed, i will not sit silent
 padhe yogendra yadav kaa puraa patr
 
 
 Kapil bhai, heard your apology at the press conference yesterday
 mujhe laga ki prashanth ji or mujhase (or saath main anand ji or ajit bhai se) maafi maangane kii bajaay un hazaron violentier, lakhon samarthakon or karodon deshavaasiyon se maafi maangani chahie thi jinke saath dhokhaa hua he
 i liked that you also supported this thing till the evening
 galati koun nahin karata, lekinmaafi maangane kii himmat har koi nahin karata
 a lot of time has passed, yet your public apologies will help heal the old wounds of many friends
 jab hamen jhuthe laanchhan lagaakar party se nikaala gaya
 At that time (especially in the Kelista resort scandal), my human confidence was shaken by seeing the role of you and many of my colleagues
 aapke vishesh anurodh par main aapke chunaav kshetra main kai baar prachaar karne gaya tha
 Think how i would have felt when i heard the accusation of betrayal from your mouth and attacked your respected Shanti Bhushan ji, still remembering and rising up
 aapane us ghatana ke sach kaa ishaara to kiya, lekin kabhi thik samajhen to us kand kaa puraa sach desh ke saamne rakh dijiyegaa
 Today, in your apology, i also heard the voice of many old comrades who feel ashamed of their actions
 chori-chupe maafi ke sandesh bhejte rahe hai, lekin khulkar bol nahin pate
 If there was any bitterness left in me after listening to her, she was washed away
 vaise aap raajnneeti main mujhase bahut hoshiyaar hai, lekin agar anyathaa na len to ek suzav duun, ye roj-roj arvind kejariwal ke khilaaf press conference kerani band kar dijie
 i do not say that all your allegations are false
 kuch aarope vajandaar hai, haalanki baaki kaa abhi koi pramaan nahin he
 But the Aam Aadmi Party will not be clear on hearing the flurry of accusations day and night, whatever faith the people have left in honest politics will be cleared
 agar ye sab aapako pataa tha to aap pichley do saal se vahaan kya kar rahe the? aaj aapako praayshchit shobhaa detaa he, pratishodh nahin
 Kapil Bhai, politics of negativity is neither in the interest of the country nor in your interest
 pichley do saal se maine apana adhikansh samay gaanv-kheti-kisaan ke sawaal par lagaaya he
 Believe me, the misdeeds of AAP leaders are not the biggest problem in this country
 jaisaa faiz ne kaha tha or bhi dukh hai jamaane main
 With best wishes, Kapil Mishra, in response to this letter after your letter, said that there should be complete disclosure, i agree with you
 jab ghotaalon kii jaankaree aegi to press conference karunga
 i will not be silent bataa den ki kapil mishra ne arvind kejariwal par apane karibiyon ke saath milakar farji companiyon ke jariye party fund jutaney kaa daawa kiya tha
 At the same time, Kapil had alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party through black money in the name of party fund, worked to white out black money

 Meanwhile, the Lokayukta has called Kapil Mishra for testimony in connection with the corruption charges leveled against Chief Minister Kejriwal and his minister Satyendar Jain

 On Sunday, former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh predicted 126 to 132 seats
 isse pehle party pradesh adhyaksh kamalnath ne kaha tha ki congress 140 se zyada siten jeetegi
 Talking to the media, Digvijay Singh said that i have been roaming all over the state for the last one year
 matdaan ke baad main vishwaas se kah saktaa hum ki congress 126 se 132 siten jitkar bahumat ke saath sarkaar bana rahi he
 However, Digvijay Singh's prediction is lower than Kamal Nath, another senior leader of his own party
 matdaan khatm hone ke turant baad unhone kuch or hi aankada diya tha
 Kamal Nath had said, 'I said earlier that we will win more than 140 seats, but seeing the voting percentage, it seems that the results will be even more shocking
 'bataa den, isse pehle digvijay singh ne kaha tha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi nahin chaahate hai ki empi main shivaraj singh chouhan, rajasthan main vasundhara raaje sindhiya or chhattisgarh main raman singh jite
 Questioning evms, he said that we do not believe in this, but Modi himself wants that these three leaders will not be disturbed in the lost evms, because the key of evms is with Modi

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is in the fray for the Lok Sabha elections 2014 with a mission of 272+
 
 
 yani, khud ke boote loksabhaa main bahumat paane kaa lakshya
 
 
 By the way, it is worth mentioning that since 1984, no single party has ever got a majority in the Lok Sabha, so even if this goal is not being considered impossible, it is very difficult
 
 
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv main bhi bijepi 182 siton se aage nahin bad pai thi, so, aise main narendra modi kii aguwai main bijepi ne ek behad kathin lakshya nirdhaarit kiya he
 
 
 But Modi is also working towards a small, but important goal with this big goal
 
 
 vah he 'mishan 26', yani unke rajya gujarat kii sabhi 26 loksabhaa siton ko bijepi ke khate main daalana
 
 
 If except for the period between September 1996 to March 1998, the BJP has been in power in Gujarat since March 1995
 
 
 uttar bharat kii party maani jane vaali bijepi ke liye yah bahut badi uplabdhi he
 
 
 The current Chief Minister Narendra Modi has also been in office since October 7, 2001
 
 
 varsh 2002 main hue gujarat dangon ke baad se narendra modi gujarati asmita kii baat karte rahe hai
 
 
 None of his statements are complete without first mentioning five crore Gujaratis and now six crore Gujaratis
 
 
 ab isi gujarati asmita ko modi nae dhang se paribhaashit karne main lage hai
 
 
 That is, a Gujarati becoming the Prime Minister of the country
 
 
 isi gujarati asmita ko rashtriya str par unhone sardaar vallabhbhai patel ke saath pesh kiya he
 
 
 He has been saying that injustice was done to Sardar Patel, because after India became independent, Sardar Patel was to become Prime Minister, but Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was replaced as Prime Minister
 
 
 morarji desai zarur aise gujarati the, jo do saal tak pradhanmantri rahe, lekin janata party ke andruni matbhedon ke chalate unhen apana kaarykaal puraa karne kaa mauka nahin mila
 
 
 At the time of the Gujarat assembly elections of 2007, the BJP quickly announced LK Advani as its prime ministerial candidate
 
 
 is daleel ke saath ki loksabhaa main gujarat kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale ek netaa ko piem ummidavaar ghoshit karne se vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko phayda hoga
 
 
 However, some party leaders say in Dabi Juban that the real motive was that Narendra Modi should not become the PM candidate after winning the 2007 elections
 
 
 iske baavjood varsh 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main gujarat main bijepi 26 main se sirf 15 siten jeet pai thi
 
 
 The BJP is in a position to win 22 Lok Sabha seats as per the performance of the 2012 assembly elections
 
 
 thodaa or jor lagane se bijepi patan, dahod or banaaskantha siten bhi jitkar yah aankada 25 tak pahunchaa sakati he
 
 
 The party is now engaged in these efforts
 
 
 narendra modi se baghawat kar alag party banane vaale keshubhai patel kii gujarat parivartan party kaa bijepi main vilay ho gaya he
 
 
 On Monday, two more Congress mlas resigned from the assembly and joined the BJP
 
 
 pichley ek saal main saat congress vidhayak or ek saansad bijepi main shaamil ho chuke hai
 
 
 Personally, it is important for Narendra Modi that the BJP perform its best in Gujarat so far
 
 
 vah khud bhi gujarat se hi loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladane ja rahe hai
 
 
 He is likely to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Ahmedabad East or Vadodara
 
 
 zaahir he, narendra modi ke liye mishan 272+ kii hi tarah gujarat kaa 'mishan 26' bhi behad mahatvapurn he

 Morkel said it would be interesting to see how India's young batsmen face the South African fast bowlers and that too when a player like Tendulkar is not part of their team
 morkal ne kaha, 'sachin aisa ballebaaj he jo lambey samay tak ballebaaji kar saktaa he
 He can put the bowlers and the opposing team under pressure by batting for a long time
 vah unki ballebaaji kaa stambh tha
 He could bat with both the top order and the middle order

 ' Asked if he did not deliberately name Virat Kohli or South Africa did not see him as a threat, Morkel did not give a firm answer to this
 unhone kaha, 'viraat ne australia main acha pradarshan kiya
 He is a good player
 lekin beshak vah sachin kii bhoomika main utrega or use badi jagah ko bharna he
 He can perform well

 When the BJP announced Mission 44 Plus in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections, the Kashmiri Pandits had their votes in mind, but polling data showed that the Kashmiri Pandits were still interested in voting despite the bjp's efforts Did not see, so as a result, BJP may not even open an account in Kashmir valley
 yah isliye bhi mahatvapurn he, kyonki kashmiri panditon ke ek-ek vot ko sunishchit karnaa bijepi kii ranneeti kaa hissaa rahaa, lekin iske baavjood party aisa nahin kar pai
 In Wadi, where separatist organizations such as the Hurriyat have little voting on many seats due to poll bycott appeals, the outright vote of the pundits could have influenced the election results
 srinagar jile main aath vidhansabha kshetra hai
 Habbakdal is the region where Kashmiri Pandit voters are the largest
 vaadi ke kul 32,136 migrant kashmiri pandit voto main se 17,470 yaheen ke hai
 But only 2,817 voted
 yahi haal emirakadal kaa rahaa, jahaan 5,275 kashmiri panditon main se sirf 837 ne vot kiya
 However, out of 2,599 pundits of Hazratbal, only 360 voted
 puure srinagar jile ke 32,136 pandit voton main se mahaz 5,169 vot pade
 They too, when 9,638 migrant Kashmiri Pandits had expressed their intention to vote by filling the m-form, that is, those who had made up their mind to vote did not even come to the polling booth
 srinagar ke adishnal disi jiem daar, jo chunaav kii zimmedaariyon ke nodel officer bhi hai, bataate hai ki kul 440 panditon ne postal ballat jari karwaae the, jinamein se khabar likhe jane tak 136 ne hi vot daal ballat waapas bheje
 It is expected to get some more enhancements by Tuesday morning
 jammu sambhag main jahaan 37 siten hai, vahaan bijepi kaa pradarshan acha rahane kii ummid jataai ja rahi he, lekin kashmir kii 46 siton main se vah kuch siten jitkar apni vijay pataakaa ko laharaate dekhnaa chaahati he
 Habbakadal has a total of 54,852 voters, of which only 11,561 cast their votes
 ye 2014 loksabhaa chunaav, 2008 vidhansabha chunaav or uske pehle ke kai chunaavon main sabase zyaada voting he
 The fate of pdp's Zafar Mehraj is also at stake in this seat
 bijepi kashmiri panditon ko kyon nahin lubhaa pai, is par vah kuch bolnaa nahin chaahate, lekin bijepi kii aakraamak prachaar style or dharmantaran par chhide vivaad se phaayde main inhen ke rahane kii ummid he
 On the other hand, Chairman of the Kashmiri Pandit Sangharsh Samiti, Sanjay Tikku, says that there are many legal and paper difficulties in getting the rights of migrant voters
 kashmiri panditon ke vot kam pade, iske peeche yah bahut badi vajah he
 This argument may have merit, but the question is that the BJP, which was so much concerned about Kashmir, did not get its attention earlier
 
 
 ? party ko jahaan jammu main acha karne kii ummid he, vahiin ghati kii 46 siton main kisi ek ke jeetne kii ummid par bhi grahan lag gaya he
 If the BJP has the highest hopes of winning a single seat in Kashmir Valley, it belongs to Habbakdal, but on one side, where the Kashmiri Pandits did not get the vote, on the other side, people voted more than before, so that the loss of Boycott BJP should not be benefited

 lekin, chunaav nateezon ke thik 6 din baad TIME badal gaya he
 On Tuesday, in one of its articles, the magazine has described Narendra Modi as linking the country

 Narendra Modi has succeeded in bringing backward caste people to his right, but the Western media was still projecting Narendra Modi as the leader of the upper caste
 lekh main narendra modi kii tarif karte hue likhaa gaya he ki kis tarah unhone ek garib parivaar se hote hue bhi desh ke sabase bade pad par jagah banaai or gandhi parivaar se raajnneetik ladaai ladi
 The author wrote that even after many criticisms in the last five years, no Prime Minister has been able to do the same in the last five decades, as Narendra Modi has united the country

 This has become possible only after a long time when the government of the same party has come to power with absolute majority twice

 The Congress has tasted defeat to the BJP by accepting it to be on the backseat in the Karnataka Assembly elections
 isaki ranneeti dilli main bani or use amal main laane ke liye congress ke ranneetikaar active ho gaye
 These strategists also included party general secretary Ashok Gehlot who prepared the story of defeat for the BJP
 rajasthan ke purv siem gahalot isse pehle gujarat main bijepi ke liye sirdard paidaa kar chuke hai
 Ashok Gehlot was the first leader to talk about joining an alliance with JDS in Karnataka
 congress ko karnataka main akele dam par sarkaar banane kii ummid thi
 But as soon as the Congress started getting its numbers low before the counting of votes on May 15, Ashok Gehlot came in front of the media and he said that according to the strategy of the Congress, the options in politics should be open and indicated that the political equations of Karnataka will now be known
 Huh
 dilli main rahul ke saath senior netaaon kii baithak main plan bana or use amal main laane ke liye gulam nabi aaazaad, ashok gahalot jaise netaa karnataka bheje gaye
 After that the exercise to save the mlas and bring the JDS into the court began
 jiskaa nateeja sabake saamne he
 The way the Congress saved Yeddyurappa and BJP from not only their own but also independents and JDS mlas, to what extent this time the party came into the fray with preparation
 modi-shah ke garh main di thi unako maatgujarat ke prabharee rahete hue ashok gahalot ne rajyasabha chunaav main ahamed patel ko jeet dilaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Even then the Congress mlas of Gujarat were kept at Eagleton Resort in Karnataka to protect them from the BJP
 unhen chunaav se ek din pehle gujarat laayaa gaya
 Amit Shah, the bjp's Chanakya, put all his efforts to defeat Ahmed Patel, but after the midnight suspense, the victory was finally won by Patel and Gehlot won the trust of the Congress leadership
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaavon main dikhaaya tha dangshok gahalot kii ranneetik safalataa gujarat vidhansabha chunaavon main saamne ai thi
 Before the election campaign, the Congress was expected to be reduced to 25-35 seats
 lekin gahalot ne rahul gandhi ko soft hindutv kaa mantra dekar saare kayaason ko galat sabit kar diya tha
 His strategy was that the BJP was stuck in 115 to 99 seats and he brought the Congress from 61 to 77 seats
 congress main aise badha ashok gahalot kaa kadacongress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke kareebi hone ke saath hi ashok gahalot kaa trek record khaasaa safal bhi rahaa he
 Originally, Gehlot of Rajasthan used to target his rival and BJP CM Vasundhara Raje Scindia only on social media
 in dinon vah piem modi ko unki nitiyon ke khilaaf gherte hai
 After the Karnataka elections, he had raised questions about Modi going to Nepal temple and said that Modi should stop such indirect election campaign

 During an event in Pali, Rajasthan, an MP has photographed Mahatma Gandhi's statue with his hand on the head

 khaastaur par desh ke har us rajya main jahaan bijepi satta sambhaal rahi he, vahaan aisi muhim jor-shor se chal rahi he
 Jharkhand is also not untouched by this, although the RSS and its associated organizations have been running such campaigns in remote tribal and rural areas of the state for a long time
 in jagahon par inke nishane par vaise parivaar hai, jinhone isai dharm sweekaar kiya he
 By the way, Christian missionaries present here have also been accused of converting by giving temptation

 Vishwa Hindu Parishad activists organized the Gram Panchayat for this and explained it to the people, after which chanting and purification by the Pandit by Hindu custom was incorporated into the Hindu religion with a drum drum
 ab tak kareeb 50 pariwaron kii ghar vapasidarasalhindu sangathnonka aarope he ki in pariwaron ko pralobhan dekar isai dharm swikaarne par majaboor kiya gaya tha
 In such a situation, these families are now being brought back to Hinduism

 gharvaapasi ke alaava logon ko jaagruk karne ke liye kuch or kaarykram bhi hindu sanghathan chalaa rahe hai, jo chotanagpur ke alaava santhalpargana ke adivasee bahul ilaakon main kendrit hai
 The RSS Sanghchalak Mohan Bhagwatbhi was also involved in one such program organized at Christian Missionaries for conversion to religion
 darasal jharkhand main garibi or pichhadepan ke shikaar adivasee ilaakon main isai mishanrij kaaphi dinon se logon ke bich unke utthan kaa kaam kar rahi he
 There have also been allegations on missionaries that under the guise of this work, these organizations are trying to convert the tribals to Christianity by tempting them
 haalanki isai dharm se jude log jabaran dharm parivartan ke aaropon se inkaar karte rahe hai
 It is equally true that the incidents of conversion have increased in these areas in the last few decades

 Priyanka Gandhi may have come to handle the Congress in Uttar Pradesh, but the factionalism within the Congress seems far away
 jis vakt congress ko ekajute kar bhaajapa ke mukaabil banane ke liye gandhi parivaar ke sabase aakarshak chehre ko maidan main utaar diya gaya he thik usee vakt bundelkhand se gutbaji kii neenv rakhane kii bhi shuruyaat kar di gai he
 It was started by King Ranjit Singh Judeo of Samathar princely state
 ranjit singh congress ke pradesh upaadhyaksh hai
 Singh has advocated not giving tickets to Pradeep Jain, considered the most influential leader of Jhansi, as well as the people whose names have been recommended for the ticket do not stand anywhere ahead of Pradeep in the ground struggle
 iske baad jhaansi main congress ke bheetar hi ghamaasan shuru ho gaya he, lekin jhaansi ke log is ghamaasan par kehane lage hai, ye to raja or rank kii ladaai he, jo chalati rahegi
 The name of Raja Ranjit Singh Judeo is one of the most senior and strong leaders of the Congress
 vah saat baar samthar garautha seat se chunaav jite or pradesh sarkarmen mantri bhi rahe, lekin lagaataar chaar chunaav haarane ke baad vah raajnneetik haashiye par bhi chale gaye
 Congress state vice-president Ranjit Singh Judeo has opposed Congress minister Sudhanshu Tripathi, Bhanu Sahai, Rahul Richaria, Rajendra Singh Yadav from Jhansi seat for the Lok Sabha ticket, opposing former minister Pradeep Jainka
 ranjit singh ne khud bhi haikaman ke kehane par chunaav ladgaye kii ichha vyakt kar di, lekin jo naam unhone aage badaye hai unamem akele bhanu sahay ko chhod den to koi bhi netaa jamini taur par sakriy nahin he
 Sudhanshu Tripathi is counted among the Hawaiian leaders
 ranjit singh judev kehete hai, "maine jamaanat jabt kara chuke netaaon ke tikat kaatane kii baat kahi he
 "pradeep Jain's bail was forfeited in the Lok Sabha, but on the question of recommending the name of Rajendra Singh Yadav, who had confiscated the bail from Babina Assembly for the Lok Sabha elections, Ranjit Singh says," He is a leader of backward classes
 Huh
 " jhaansi ke samajasevi manoj reja kaa maananaa he ki ranjit singh judev samthar riyasat ke raja hai or unke aage jamine se uthne vaale pradeep jain rank jaise
 In such a situation, when a king starts to grow up, clipping on him is also a part of politics
 jabaki, jhaansi ke sthaneey logon kii maane to congress main abhi jhaansi seat par pradeep jain ke mukaable kaa ummidavaar nahin he
 If journalist Diwakar Pandey is believed, Ranjit Singh Judeo has given air to the factionalism of the Congress on the occasion of an election, which will damage the Congress in the election
 yah tab ho rahaa he jab congress ne apane sabase aakarshak chehre priyanka gandhi ko uttar pradesh main congress ko majboot karne ke mishan par bheja he
 If the situation remains the same, it will be challenging for the Congress to become politically strong
 mushkil daur main congress ko jeet dilaane kaa he pradeep ko shreyjab congress kaa mushkil kaal tha tab pradeep jain aditya ne bhaajapa kaa garh maani jane vaali jhaansi sadar seat se congress ko jeet dilaai
 He won the assembly elections twice from here
 or 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jab unako jhaansi loksabhaa seat se congress ne pratyaashee banaaya to unhone yahaan se chunaav jitkar bundelkhand main ek adad jeet ko taras rahi congress kaa khaataa khol diya
 With this victory, he was made Minister of State for Rural Development in UPA 2
 lekin 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main modi lahar ke bich pradeep jain kii jamaanat jabt ho gai
 Now his future also started to be questioned
 sawaal isliye bhi kyonki vah jhaansi meyar kaa chunaav bhi lard gaye or haar bhi gaye
 On this, Pradeep Jain Aditya says, "I think of keeping the Congress strong and alive at all levels at all times
 meyar ke chunaav main jab koi congress kii ore se ladgaye ko taiyaar nahin hua to mujhe hi chunaav main utarana padaa
 Even though the election was defeated, the Congress was in the main contest
 "*** The whole family of Bollywood actor Dharmendra has now entered politics
 pehle dharmendra ne bijepi kii tikat par bikaner se chunaav ladaa tha, or ve saansad bhi bane the
 But then Dharmendra avoided politics
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main hema malini (hema Malini) or sani deol (sunny Deol) ne bhi baaji maar lee or donon hi saansad ban gaye hai
 When Sunny Deol won the election from Gurdaspur in Punjab on a BJP ticket, Hema Malini has won the victory from Mathura
 lekin dharmendra (dharmendra) apane raajnneeti ke dinon ko ab bhi nahin bhuule hai, or unhone rajasthan kii purv mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje (vashundhara Raje) ke saath apni ek photo share kii he or kuch khaas jaankaree bhi di he

 '- input IANS Union Minister Smriti Irani has received a major relief from the Delhi High Court in a 6-year-old case
 darasal, court ne smriti irani ke khilaaf congress netaa sanjay nirupam dwaara darj karaae gaye manahani ke cese ko khatm kar diya he
 The court has admitted that the manner in which Sanjay Nirupam used profanity against Smriti Irani during the live TV debates and made a personal attack on her creates a defamation case against her
 bataa den ki ek tivi sho ke dauraan sanjay nirupam ne smriti irani par apshabdon kaa istemaal kiya tha jiske baad donon ne ek- duusare ke khilaaf manahani kaa mukadmaa darj karavaaya tha
 Today, after the Delhi High Court order, the defamation case ended on Smriti Irani, but Sanjay will continue on Nirupam
 philhal ye mukadmaa patiala house court main chal rahaa he
 Both had filed an application in the Delhi High Court to quash the FIR lodged against them, on which the High Court today decided in favor of Smriti Irani
 isse pehle hui sunwaayee main hai court main donon pakshon ko samjhauta karne kaa mauka diya tha lekin iske liye naa to smriti irani taiyaar thim or naa hi sanjay nirupam
 Smriti Irani thanked the Delhi High Court on this relief order from the court and wrote on Twitter that her fight will continue
 patiala house court main is maamle se jude trial main ab tak donon apane bayaan darj karvaa chuke hai
 During the last hearing in Patiala House Court, Bhishmriti Irani had strongly objected to this before the judge
 sanjay nirupam ne court room main bhi unke saath abhadra bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya
 However, in many cases related to defamation, many leaders have ended the case either by mutual consent or by apologizing
 dekhnaa hoga ki kya sanjay nirupam bhi is maamle main maafee maang kar is maamle ko khatm karenge yaa phir trial puraa hone ke baad court hi is par apana kuch faisla sunayega

 unke mutabik, katl kii supaari pradeep sharma ke jariye hi di gai
 Significantly, on the evening of November 11, 2006, the police claimed that they killed the dreaded goon (lakhan Bhaiya) in an encounter near Nani Nani Park in Andheri, but the other day Lakhan's brother claimed in front of the press that his Bhai is not dead in the encounter, rather he was abducted from Navi Mumbai and first taken to Mumbai, later murdered and fabricated the fake story of the encounter
 saboot ke taur par ram prasad gupta ne ve fax or telegram dikhaae, jo unhone dopaher main lakhan ke agava hone ke turant baad police ayukta ko bheje the
 In it, he had also expressed apprehension of a fake encounter
 lakhan ke parijanon kii aawaaj ansuni rah jaati agar unka bhai vakil nahin hota
 Ram Prasad approached the court, the matter was investigated
 jaanch main police kii kahani galat sabit hui, lihaaja hoicourt nen disipi kii aguwai main esaiti banaakar jaanch kaa aadesh diya tha

 As evidence, Ram Prasad Gupta showed faxes and telegrams which he had sent to the Commissioner of Police shortly after Lakhan was kidnapped in the afternoon

 The voice of Lakhan's family would have remained unheard if his brother had not been a lawyer

 jaanch me pataa chalaa lakhan bhaiya kii hatya ek supaari keeling thi, jo lakhan ke hi partner janardan bhaange ne di thi
 Another screw in the story came when Anil Bheda, the key witness in the case, suddenly disappeared just before the testimony
 maheene baad uski laash jali haalat main wada ke ek farm house main mili
 In fact, when Lakhan was abducted from Navi Mumbai on 11 November, Anil Bheda was also present at that time
 police ne use maheenon tak bandi banaakar pehle andheri, phir kolhapur main chipa rakhaa tha

 lekin uttar pradesh ke jonpur jile ke gaanv bhadethi main rahane vaale 30 varshiya mohammad javed ke dil main apana-paraayaa jaisi bhaavana kabhi thi hi nahin
 That is why in view of the suffering and need of people living in more than half a dozen villages, including Bhadethi, they have constructed a bridge 40 meters long with their own money on the river Basso
 is par takreeban 35 lakh ru
 Cost of unka gaanv beson nadi ke kinare basaa he, jisaki aabaadi takreeban 3,500 he
 The river flows between Bhadeethi and Bhado village, on which people had to face a lot of difficulties due to lack of a bridge
 unhen yaa to tairkar janaa padataa yaa phir ghanton nadi kinare naav kaa intjaar karnaa padataa
 After all, all the things needed are not provided in the same village
 isliye nadi ke us paar janaa bhi jarurat or majaburi thi
 Then Javed decided to build a bridge over the river
 ve kehete hai, ''rosemara ke kaamon ke liye nadi paar jane kii takalif to thi hi, saath hi betiyon kii shaadi main bhi kaaphi dikkat aati thi
 Crossing the river was nothing less than a challenge
 gaanv ke log vidhayakon or saansadon ko apana dukhada suna-sunaakar thak chuke the, lekin kisi ne sud nahin lee
 So i decided that now i have to do this work
 ” jonpur nagar ke purv vidhayak javed ansaari kehete hai, ''bhadethi ke log mere paas apni maang lekar aae the or maine apni taraf se puri koshish karne kaa vaada bhi kiya tha
 The first bridge over the river Beso was built by Javed's grandfather Haji Shamsuddin in 1996
 tab javed 14 baras ke the
 30 lakhs
 kii laagat se bana yah pul 5-6 maheene main banakar taiyaar bhi ho gaya
 This philanthropy of his grandfather had a profound effect on Javed's mind
 usee vakt is nadi par duusare pul kaa nirmaan kaary bhi shuru hua tha, lekin kisi vajah se vah adhuraa hi rah gaya
 Then Javed took up the task of constructing it and now he is ready to be the second bridge
 is par avaagaman shuru ho gaya he
 The bridge also works to connect two districts, Jaunpur and Azamgarh, apart from Bhadeethi and Bhado villages
 isaki lambaai 40 meter he
 Javed was born into a wealthy family
 unke dada haji shamsuddin bade jameendaar the
 His father Mohammad Zakaria and a lot of family members now live in Singapore, where he has a family business
 bhadetha main unke paas khandaani 100 bigha jameen he
 Javed himself stayed in Singapore for a long time, but returned there due to lack of mind
 ve har saal apane kharch par garibon kii shaadiyaan karavaate hai or ab tak 30 jodon kii shaadiyaan karvaa chuke hai
 He has also built a house for 20 poor people
 javed ke liye yah maamuli baaten hai, lekin gaanvvaalon ke liye to ve khuda kaa rup hai
 Mohammad Rafiuddin of Bhadethi says, "I am a poor man
 ” mujhe chintaa thi ki bahan kii shaadi kaise karuunga
 But he paid two lakh for the wedding
 dekar mujhe ubaar liya
 "through his noble deeds, Javed has carved a special place in the hearts of the villagers

 resler narsingh yadav ko doping ke maamle main fanse hue 3 saal se upar ho gaye hai lekin wo abhi bhi insaaf ke liye court ke chakkar laga rahe hai
 This case was also given by the Delhi High Court to the CBI for investigation but even after being over 2 years, the CBI has not yet completed its investigation
 jaanch puri hone main lagaataar ho rahi deree ko lekar dilli hai court ne sibiai ko kadi fatkaar lagaai he
 The Delhi High Court has asked the CBI to file its status report in this case and the court will hear it again on 20 August
 court main sunwaayee ke dauraan sibiai ke vakil ne kaha ki resler narsingh yadav par abhi bhi jaanch chal rahi he
 But the scientist whose statement is to be taken from Canada has not yet been recorded
 isliye abhi tak jaanch puri nahin ho pai he
 The CBI has told the court that the scientist was called several times to give a statement
 canada ambysi ke jariye bhi scientist se bayaan dene ko kaha gaya he lekin ab tak wo nahin ai hai
 Narasimha Yadav's lawyer objected to this and said that it is unfair to Narasimha
 sibiai narsingh yadav ke kariyar ke saath khel rahi he
 Narasimha named who told him to adulterate their food, but the CBI has not even been able to interrogate the person
 darasal narsingh yadav ne dilli hai court main yachika daayar kar kaha tha ki unhen olympic main khilne se rokane ke liye doping ke aarope main fansaaya gaya tha
 For this reason, he requested the CBI to investigate the matter
 teen saal puraa hone par bhi sibiai kuch nahin kar pai he
 Narsingh Yadav is banned from playing due to doping till March 2020
 saal 2016 main rio olympic main jane se pehle narsingh yadav dope main doshi paae gaye the, jiske baad neshnal anti doping agency (nadaa) ne un par 4 saal ke liye pratibandh laga diya tha
 After that Narasimha Yadav complained to Rai police station in Sonepat that a conspiracy had happened to him
 shikaayat main ek ladke kaa naam bhi narsingh kii taraf se police ko diya gaya lekin narsingh kaa aarope he ki police kaa ravaiya sust rahaa or koi jaanch nahin kii
 The case was then transferred to the CBI, but Narsingh Yadav has to bear the brunt of the lethargy of the country's largest investigative agency
