 Justice Jagdish Sharan Verma1933-2013 Justices Jagdish Sharan Verma finally left us on April 24
 unke nidhan ne yaadon ke na jane kitne daravaaje khol die hai
 The same well-known picture is being displayed in the mind
 unki adaalat main aane vaale vakeelon ke liye ve ek dheer-gambhir or sateek faisle sunaane vaale jaj the jo kanoon kii taknikiyon se upar uthakar nyaay kii gahari bhaavana se kaam kiya karte the
 Those who have read his rulings must know that Justice Verma was part of the bench of some very important decisions of the Supreme Court
 ye faisle bataur nyaayadhish unke ek dashak ke safar ko paribhaashit karte hai
 From federalism to secularism, from justice to women to environmental justice, from appointment of judges to removal of mps
 saare maamalon ko unhone bakhubi sambhala
 But what they will always be remembered for is a historic step
 iske tahat unhone ek aisi prakriya pesh kii, jiske jariye supreme court rasookh vaale or prabhutvshaalee logon ke khilaaf darj gambhir aaropon kii jaanch or nigaraanee karata he
 During cases like Jain hawala, fodder scam and Tantrik Chandraswamy, he ensured that no matter how big a person is, the law will do its job
 unhone yah maanane se saaf inkaar kar diya ki varisht sarkari afasaron par chalane vaale mukademe kii sunwaayee ke dauraan aaropon kii sibiai jaanch main sarkaar kaa koi niyantran ho
 Unfortunately, the government issued an ordinance to cancel it before the verdict dried up
 in maamalon main desh ne dekha ki asamvedansheel or bhrasht ho rahe rajanetaaon ko javabdehi kaa paath sikhaane ke liye supreme court ne ek nai bhoomika kii jimmedaari uthaa lee thi
 Justice Verma, in favor of judicial activism, always kept in mind that the court should interfere in the same disputes which can be settled on the basis of judicial norms
 unki sabase badi khaasiyat yah thi ki unke man main jab kuch karne kii baat baith gai to use har haal main karke hi choda jaae, uske liye chaahe kisi bhi aalochana kyon na jhelni pade
 i recall an incident when he appointed me as an amicus curiae, a judicial friend in an air pollution case in Delhi
 unhone mujhase nyaayik mitra ke rup main kaam karne ko lekar jaananaa chaha to maine jawaab diya ki isamen ek virodhabhasi sthiti paidaa ho sakati he
 Actually, i had earlier advocated on behalf of the auto industry
 unhone jht se kaha ki yah to or bhi acha hoga kyonki main maamle ko pehle se hi achche se jaanata hum
 He did not care what the "overbearing" reviewers who were circling the corridors of the court would say about it? He petitioned a contract challenging the contract to cut Khair trees in Jammu and Kashmir Was converted into a public interest litigation
 ise bharat hi nahin balki kai duusare mulkon main bhi foresti cese ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 a bench headed by him continued to hear the case from 1996 until his retirement
 aise hi ek maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan uttar-purv ke jangalon main ho rahi pedo kii kataai ko rokane ke pahn main ve faisla dena chaah rahe the
 At this juncture, the then Attorney General presented the final argument in such a way that we need only wood for children from cradles to coffins, even the panels in the court room where they are sitting
 is daleel ko ek ore rakhte hue justise verma ne turant jawaab diya ki prakruti par boj daale bagaiyr hamen apni jarurat kii seemaa ke andar rahanaa siikhnaa chahie
 Even if there were no wooden panels in his court room, the quality of his decisions would have been the same
 supreme court sirf vivaadon ko nibatane vaali ijalas bhar nahin balki ek shaskeey prakriya behaal rakhane vaali sanstha bhi he
 a good judge should be a king of both heart and mind, a craftsman and engineer who is constantly working to shape the form of law so as to create the social structure necessary to fulfill the constitutional goal of egalitarian justice
 To be completed
 vakt ke hisaab se anyaay ke tamaam pahaluon kaa nibatara karnaa hota he
 Justice Verma emphasized the need to raise the status of the law
 ayodhya vivaad main dharmanirpekshata ke taane-bane kaa santulan banaae rakhane ke liye adaalat se ek alag kism ke samaadhaan kii darkaar thi
 While facing such challenges, he showed that he has a high position among the veterans who are adorning the back
 ve un nyaayadhishon kii qatari main khadey hone ke hakdaar hai jinhone ek nayaa nyaayik darshan taiyaar kiya
 a philosophy that helped secure democracy in a stricken republic like ours, and made our court one of the most powerful courts in the world
 panchtatv main villin justise verma sharir rup main beshak hamaare saath na hon par jo viraasat ve hamen saunp gaye hai, vah hamaari vyavastha main maujuud gandagi ko saaf karne main madad karti rahegi

 com / y3esgtz48x worldcup main south africa se haar ke baad srilanka ke worldcup main safar ke saath-saath sabase behtareen khilaadi mahela jayavardhane or kumaar sangakaara kaa ek-divasiy match main safar khatm ho gaya he
 Where Jayawardene has also said goodbye to Test cricket and it is expected that Sangakkara will also retire from Test cricket by August
 donon khilaadiyon ne kai kirtiman kaayam kiye hai or srilanka cricket ko ek nayaa naam diya he
 Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene were born on one year and one date and the journey of both ended on the same day
 jayavardhane kaa janm 27 may 1977 or sangakaara kaa janm 27 oktober 1977 ko hua
 Jayawardene was five months older than Sangakkara and Jayawardene started his international cricket career three years before Sangakkara
 jayavardhane ne apane antarrashtriya kariyar kii shuruyaat bharat ke khilaaf 1997 ko kii thi jabaki sangakaara ne apana pehla match 2000 main south africa ke khilaaf khelaa
 But when it comes to the record, Sangakkara surpassed Jayawardene
 bachapan main tennis ke prati ruchi rakhane vaale sangakaara ne wicket ke peeche se cricket ko sabase kareeb se dekha, na jane kitne khilaadiyon kii kismat ko cricket globe ke andar sameta
 Sangakkara says that if he is a good cricketer today, his credit goes to his school principal
 wicket ke peeche unki pratibha ko dekhte hue skool principal ne unhen cricket khilne ke liye protsaahit kiya tha
 Sangakkara, who aspired to play tennis in childhood, has made many records in cricket
 sangakaara ne 404 ekadivasiy match khelte hue kareeb 42 kii ausat se 14,234 ran banaae hai, jo sachin tendulkar ke baad kisi khilaadi ke naam sabase zyada ran banane kaa record he
 When it comes to Test matches, Sangakkara has scored 12,203 runs from 130 Test matches at an average of 59
 srilanka ke cricket itihaas main test or ek-divasiy match main sabase zyada ran banane kaa kirtiman sangakaara ke naam he
 Sangakkara is also ahead in wicket keeping
 sangakaara ne ekadivasiy match main sabase behtareen wicket keeping karte hue 404 match main 383 kaich or 99 stamping ke saath kul 482 khilaadiyon ko chalate kiya he
 Jayawardene has scored 11,814 runs at an average of around 50, playing 149 Test matches
 isamen 34 shatak or 51 ardhshtak shaamil hai or 374 ran unke test kariyar kaa sarvaadhik vyaktigat score he jo srilanka ke liye ek record he
 Jayawardene holds the record for most ODI matches for Sri Lanka
 jayavardhane ne 448 ek-divasiy match khelte hue kareeb 34 kii ausat se 12,650 ran banaae he
 Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara gave Sri Lanka cricket a new path
 donon ne kai record banaae
 The pair of Sangakkara and Jayawardene also held the record for the most partnership in a Test match
 2006 main south africa ke khilaaf donon ke bich 624 ran kii saajhedaari hui jo ek world record he
 Today Sri Lanka may have lost but Sangakkara played the highest innings of 45 runs for Sri Lanka
 sangakaara jab out ho gaye tab barish kii boondabandi shuru ho gai or match kuch der ke liye rokna padaa
 Perhaps Rain also wanted to congratulate him for Sangakkara's illustrious career

 Notably, in addition to the high bridges, there are many unique bridges in China, one of which is the glass bridge, which is named 'the Haohan Qiao' or 'brave Men Bridge'
 yah pul china ke hunan praant main ek aisi khai par banaaya gaya he, jisaki 180 meter kii gaharaai vaise hi dil dahala detii he, lekin is pul ko paar karne ke liye 'diler' hona isaki oonchai kii vajah se zaruri nahin he, balki isaki ek or visheshta kii vajah se zaruri he
 
 
 Actually, the floor of this bridge, which is 300 meters long, is made entirely of glass
 
 
 gauratlab he ki oonche pulon ke alaava china main anuthe pul bhi kai hai, jinamein se ek vah kaanch kaa pul he, jiskaa naam 'da haaohan kiyaao' (the Haohan Qiao) yaa 'bahadur mardon kaa pul' rakhaa gaya he
 This bridge is built on a moat in Hunan province of China, whose depth of 180 meters likewise makes the heart tremble, but it is not necessary to be 'spunky' to cross this bridge because of its height, but its Necessary because of another feature
 
 
 darasal, is pul kaa farsh, jo 300 meter lambaa he, puri tarah kaanch kaa bana hua he

 is aashwast yuvak ko jawaab pataa tha lekin unhone sabhi ko hairaan karte hue apni aakhri lifline kaa istemaal kiya
 When asked by Amitabh Bachchan why he chose Lifeline when he knew the answer, Sanoj politely mentioned that since he would not be able to use Lifeline for the 7 crore question, he felt that it was used instead of going waste

 ranvir-ranbir main kya he alag?unhone ranvir singh or ranbir kapur ke acting methd kii tulana karte hue bataaya ki unka methd ranbir kapur se miltaa he
 Deepika said, 'ranbir (kapoor) has no special way; She is very natural
 maine unhen kabhi kisi role ke liye khaas taiyaari karte nahin dekha
 He is like me in this matter
 ham 50% reharsal karte hai or 50% apane hisaab se kaam karte hai
 Ranveer (singh) follows the process right there
 wo apane role ke liye sabakuch badal dete hai
 From your car to clothes and perfumes too
 wo har 6 maheene main ek alag insaan ban jate hai
 Perhaps this is why our relationship has lasted so long

 dakshin pashchim japan main bachaav dal ke sadasyon ne jabardast bukamp ke chah ghante se adhik samay baad shuukravaar subah ek dhwast imaarat se naatakeey andaaj main ek bacchee ko jinda baahar nikaala
 Nine people died in this earthquake
 'rashtriya police agency' dwaara uplabdh karaae gaye video footage main dikhaaya gaya ki rahtakarmiyon ne dhwast ghar ke malbe se gulabi rang kaa pyjama pahani bacchee ko baahar nikaala
 The incident is from the town of Mashiki in Kumamoto province, where Thursday night 6
 5 tivrata kaa bukamp aayaa tha
 The name of the child has not been mentioned
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki use koi chot nahin lagi he
 During the earthquake, the child's mother, grandfather, grandmother and elder brother were in one room and kitchen, while the girl was sleeping in another room on the first floor
 bacchee ke parivaar ke sadasyon kii bhi jaan batch gai
 They too tried to save the girl, but the house collapsed
 tippaniyan (this news has not been edited by the NDTV team
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Video footage provided by the 'national Police Agency' showed that the relief workers rescued the girl wearing pink pajamas from the wreckage of the demolished house
 yah ghatana kumamoto praant ke mashiki kasbe kii he, jahaan guuruuvaar raat 6
 There was an earthquake of 5 magnitude
 bacchee kaa naam nahin bataaya gaya he
 He is being told that he has not suffered any injuries
 bukamp kaa jhatka aane ke vakt bacchee kii maa, dada, daadi or bada bhai ek kamare tathaa rasoi main the, jabaki yah bacchee pehali manzil par ek anya kamare main so rahi thi
 The child's family members also survived
 unhone bhi bacchee ko bachaane kaa prayaas kiya tha, lekin ghar dhah gaya

 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 This is published directly from Syndicate Feed) (NDTV team has not edited this news
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The constitution in India is supreme or caste and religious organizations
 har maheene do maheene ke antaraal par jati or dharm ke naam par koi sanghathan khadaa ho jaataa he or khud ko samvidhan or usase bane kanoonon se upar ghoshit kar detaa he
 How do such institutions get such an exemption that whenever the currents of the Constitution flow in the river and declare themselves the system
 aasthaa ke naam par 90 ke dashak main bharat main jo kuch bhi hua ab uski frenchizi khul gai he
 The opening of a franchise means that the big shop is silent and on its instinct small shops open and challenge the constitution
 aisa nahin he ki in sansthaaon ke paas sirf takat hoti he, samarthan nahin hota he
 There is often a lot of support
 to sawaal uthta he ki ye saamaanya or saadhaaran log bhi saamaajik aan baan shaan ke naam par aise sanghathanon ke peeche kyon khadey ho jate hai, kya unhen samvidhan se zyaada aise sanghathanon kii sharan main janaa surakshit lagata he
 You will think 25 janvari kii subah motorcycle par savaar rajput naujavaanon kaa yah juluus dekhie
 This is different from the procession that usually takes place
 is samooh main sirf ek jati ke log hai
 After all, so many boys have not come from zero
 zaahir he inke juluus ko saamaajik manyata bhi he yani maa baap ne bhi kaha hoga ki ja simran ja, apni shaan ke liye bike chalaa
 The performance of a caste is not limited here
 mujaffarpur kii ek tasviir aapke liye anjaani nahin he
 Why do you have swords in your hands? kya aapako lagata he ki ye talavaarein samvidhan ke sammaan main nikaali gayi hai
 The Chief Minister is issuing paper orders to take strict action but what action is being taken
 supreme court kaa aadesh he ki film release ho lekin tab kya karenge jab cinema ghar ke maalikon kii supreme court ke prati vafadari kam he, in sanghathanon ke prati vafadari zyaada he
 There may not be loyalty for everyone, but then you can question whether these cinema owners did not run the film because they do not have faith in the institutions whose job is to maintain constitutional order
 pradhanmantri ne saat sankalp liye the ki paanch saal main sampradayikta or jatvaad mitaa denge, sunne main acha laga, vigyapanon main slogan bana magar teen maheene se chal rahi is hinsak nautanki ke bare main pradhanmantri kii koi tippni tak nahin ai he
 Nor has any Leader of the Opposition been able to muster up the courage to speak out against it
 aaj samvidhan akelaa khadaa he
 We will show which face of this constitution which many people sacrificed in the long run of freedom to implement
 kya 26 janvari kii parade hamaare liye loha lakkad se bane saamaanon ke pradarshan kii hi parade he yaa yah parade samvidhan kii maryaada ke haq main khade hone kii parade he
 The picture of Udaipur in Rajasthan is not very old
 adaalat ke pravesh dwaar kii chat par bhagava dhvaj lekar noujvaan chadh jate hai
 The dock media secretly sidelined this picture
 adaalatein bhi chup rah gayi
 No judge remembers how the religious flag came inside the building run by the book of the Constitution
 uski chat par lahraane kaa dussahas kaise hua
 For this purpose, every kind of senior officer posted in the district should be dismissed from his job
 koi aapako nahin batayega ki jab is aarope main giraftaar ladke kii rihaai hui to use usee tarah shaan se waapas le jaaya gaya jis shaan se usne adaalat par bhagava dhvaj fahraaya tha
 This picture of the same Udaipur is only on 25 January
 phir se jatigat dhwaja liye ye noujvaan sadakon par jamaa hai
 Are they gathered for the dignity of the constitution or for the dignity of caste
 ek film itane naujavaanon ke bheetar jatigat swabhimaan jagaa detii he phir hamaare aapke bheetar koi sanvaidhanik swabhimaan bhi he, soya hua yaa aadha jaagaa hua hi sahi
 These people are two in one
 ek din jati ke naam par nikalate hai ek din dharm kii raksha ke naam par dadagiri karne ke liye nikalate hai
 When your elected leaders were seen standing in favor of the Constitution at such a time
 agar aap khud ko zimmedaar naagarik kehete hai to vah naagarikta kya he, uski zimmedaari kahaan se aati he, kya samvidhan se nahin aati he
 When you say that you are Indian and proud of it, what image emerges, of religion, of tradition and whether these images also include pride in the Constitution
 aapke bheetar kitni nishthaaen hai, kya jati or dharm kii nishthaaon ke saath samvidhan ke prati nishtha he yaa he hi nahin
 Is this confusion because you have not yet understood the constitution or many people or organizations have not resolved the clash of gundai in the name of constitution and traditions within you
 tippaniyan This is not the first time that the film is being opposed
 film kaa virodh is tarah se set ap kiya gaya he ki ek samudaay ke bheetar pehle jatigat nishtha paidaa ho jaae or phir use manzuri mili sampradayik nishtha se
 Both types of allegiance are working in it
 yahi nishtha he jo chunaav ke samay aapako yaad dilaati he ki vot sampradayik nishtha ke liye daalana he
 Why do we find our whereabouts in such devotions again and again? The film Padmavat has been debated in this country for three months
 pehle ise gujarat chunaavon kii prishthbhumi main chalaaya gaya or ab jab naujavaanon ke rojgaar ke sawaalon kaa vakt aa rahaa tha jo unke haath main mashaalen, talavaarein pakadaa di gayi
 You are getting weaker day by day
 aap jis bheed main hai usee bheed ke shikaar ho rahe hai
 The spokespersons of the organizations came to the studio debate with the sword, one day will also come with the gun
 yah set ap yani peeche se sajaayaa gaya masalaa na hota to rajyon ke mukhyamantri chup nahin nazar aate
 They would not have stood with armies formed in the name of Rajput caste
 mukhyamantri samvidhan ke saath khadaa dikhegaa yaa kisi jati kii sena ke saath
 India's democracy has lost a day before 26 January
 aapane is bheed ko itani manzuri di he ki vah ab bacchon se bhari bas par bhi hamalaa kar sakati he
 Look at this picture in which India your children are growing up
 aaj kii baat nahin he, aage kii bhi baat he, raajnneeti main dharm kaa istemaal ho rahaa he or dharm main talavaaron kaa istemaal ho rahaa he
 On the occasion of Ramnavami, a procession is taken out with swords, not Ramayana
 kya in sanghathanon ko samvidhan par bharosa nahin he ki unki raksha karegaa
 Have we implemented the constitution in the buildings of institutions, have we not been able to implement its spirit in the people
 kyon abhi bhi faisle kaa adhikaar bheed ke haathon main he, ek film ke naam par supreme court kii saakh daanv par lag gai hai
 Cinema owners who have not performed the film have not turned down the Supreme Court
 samvidhan ko nahin thukraayaa he? ham aaj kuch aise hi sawaalon par charchaa karnaa chaahate hai
 What is constitution, what is our citizenship
 is sho kaa makasad yah bhi he ki lakhon aise chaatr jo apni garibi ke kaaran or amiri kii mouj masti ke kaaran samvidhan tak nahin pahunch pate hai unhen kuch phayda ho
 Watch this procession of Rajput youth riding on a motorcycle on the morning of 25 January
 yah aam taur par nikalne vaale juluus se alag he
 There are only one caste in this group
 aakhir itane ladke shunya se to nahin aae hai
 It is evident that their procession also has social recognition, that is, the parents must have said that Ja Simran ja, ride a bike for his pride
 ek jati kaa pradarshan yaheen tak simit nahin he
 a picture of Muzaffarpur is not unknown to you
 haathon main talwaar kyon hai
 Do you think these swords have been drawn in honor of the constitution
 mukhyamantri log kaagazi aadesh jari kar rahe hai ki sakhti se karrwai karen lekin kya karrwai ho rahi he
 The Supreme Court orders that the film be released, but what will happen when the owners of cinema houses have less loyalty to the Supreme Court, more loyalty to these organizations
 ho saktaa he ki sabake liye vafadari na ho lekin tab aap yah sawaal kar sakate hai ki kya in cinema maalikon ne isliye film ko nahin chalaaya kyonki unhen un sansthaaon main hi bharosa nahin he ki jinka kaam sanvaidhanik vyavastha banaae rakhana he
 The Prime Minister had made seven resolutions that in five years, communalism and casteism would be eradicated, it was nice to hear, slogans were made in the advertisements but no comment of the Prime Minister has come about this violent gimmick which has been going on for three months
 na hi koi vipaksh kaa netaa saahas juta sakaa he ki iske kilaaf bol de
 Today the constitution stands alone
 ham koun sa cheharaa is samvidhan ko dikhaaenge jise lagu karne ke liye azaadi kii lambii chali ladaai main na jane kitne logon ne balidaan diya
 Is the parade of 26 January a parade of the display of items made of iron clad for us or is it a parade of standing up for the dignity of the Constitution
 bahut puraani nahin he rajasthan ke udaipur kii tasviir
 On the roof of the entrance of the court, the youth climb up with the saffron flag
 godi media ne chupake se is tasviir ko kinare laga diya
 The courts also remained silent
 kisi jaj ko yaad nahin rahaa ki samvidhan kii kitaab se chalane vaali imaarat ke bheetar dharmik dhvaj kaise aa gaya
 How daring to wave on his roof
 kaayade se iske liye zile main tainaat har tarah ke bade adhikari ko naukari se barkhaast kar dena chahie
 Nobody will tell you that when the boy arrested on this charge was released, he was taken back in the same way he had hoisted the saffron flag on the court
 usee udaipur kii yah tasviir 25 janvari kii hi he
 Again, these young men are gathering on the streets for the caste flag
 kya ve samvidhan kii maryaada ke liye jamaa hue hai yaa jati kii maryaada ke liye jamaa hue hai
 a film awakens caste self-respect within so many young people, then we also have a constitutional self-respect within you, asleep or half-awake
 ye log tu in van hote hai
 One day they go out in the name of caste and one day they go out to do Dadagiri in the name of protecting religion
 kab aapke chune hue netaa aise vakt main samvidhan ke haq main khadey dikhe
 If you call yourself a responsible citizen, what is that citizenship, where does the responsibility come from, does it not come from the Constitution? jab aap kehete hai ki aap bhartiya hai or is par garv hai to kya chhavi ubhartee he, dharm kii, parampara kii or kya in chhaviyon main samvidhan ke prati gaurav bhi shaamil hota he
 How many allegiances are there within you, whether there is loyalty to the Constitution or not to the allegiance of caste and religion
 kya yah kanfuzan isliye he ki aap abhi tak samvidhan ko samaj nahin paae yaa phir bahut se log yaa sanghathan apane bheetar samvidhan or panraparaaon ke naam par gundai kaa takaraav sulajhaa nahin paae hai
 The comments yah pehali baar to nahin he ki film kaa virodh ho rahaa he
 The film's protest is set up in such a way that caste loyalty is first instilled within a community and then approved by communal allegiance
 donon tarah kii nishthaaen isamen kaam kar rahi hai
 It is this allegiance that reminds you at the time of election that votes have to be cast for communal loyalty
 kyon ham baar baar aisi nishthaaon main, apana thikaana khojate hai? is mulk main teen maheene se film padmavat ko lekar bahes chal rahi he
 First it was run against the backdrop of Gujarat elections and now when the time of employment questions of the youth was coming which were holding torches, swords in their hands
 aap dinon din kamazor hote ja rahe hai
 You are falling prey to the same crowd you are in
 sanghathanon ke pravaktaa talwaar lekar studio kii bahes main aae, ek din bandook lekar bhi aaenge
 If this set up was not a back-up issue, then the Chief Ministers of the states would not appear silent
 ve rajput jati ke naam par bani senaaon ke saath khadey na hote
 The Chief Minister will be seen standing with the Constitution or with an army of any caste
 26 janvari se ek din pehle bharat kaa loktantr haar gaya he
 You have given this crowd so much permission that it can now attack a bus full of children
 is tasviir ko dekhie ki aapke bachche kis bharat main bada ho rahe hai
 It is not the case of today, it is also further, religion is being used in politics and swords are being used in religion
 ramanavami ke avasar par ramayana nahin talavaaron ko lekar juluus nikaale jate hai
 Do these organizations not trust the Constitution to protect them? kya hamane samvidhan ko sansthaaon kii imaaraton main hi lagu kiya, kya ham jan jan main isaki bhaavana ko lagu nahin kar paae hai
 Why the verdict is still in the hands of the crowd, the credibility of the Supreme Court in the name of a film is at stake
 jin cinema maalikon ne film kaa pradarshan nahin kiya he kya unhone supreme court ko thukraa nahin diya he
 Have not rejected the constitution? We want to discuss some similar questions today
 samvidhan kya he, hamaari naagarikta kya he
 The purpose of this show is also that millions of students who are unable to reach the constitution due to their poverty and enjoyment of richness, have some benefit
 supreme court kaa aadesh he ki film release ho lekin tab kya karenge jab cinema ghar ke maalikon kii supreme court ke prati vafadari kam he, in sanghathanon ke prati vafadari zyaada he
 There may not be loyalty for everyone, but then you can question whether these cinema owners did not run the film because they do not have faith in the institutions whose job is to maintain constitutional order
 pradhanmantri ne saat sankalp liye the ki paanch saal main sampradayikta or jatvaad mitaa denge, sunne main acha laga, vigyapanon main slogan bana magar teen maheene se chal rahi is hinsak nautanki ke bare main pradhanmantri kii koi tippni tak nahin ai he

 Look at this picture in which India your children are growing up
 aaj kii baat nahin he, aage kii bhi baat he, raajnneeti main dharm kaa istemaal ho rahaa he or dharm main talavaaron kaa istemaal ho rahaa he
 On the occasion of Ramnavami, a procession is taken out with swords, not Ramayana
 kya in sanghathanon ko samvidhan par bharosa nahin he ki unki raksha karegaa
 Have we implemented the constitution in the buildings of institutions, have we not been able to implement its spirit in the people
 kyon abhi bhi faisle kaa adhikaar bheed ke haathon main he, ek film ke naam par supreme court kii saakh daanv par lag gai hai
 Cinema owners who have not performed the film have not turned down the Supreme Court
 samvidhan ko nahin thukraayaa he? ham aaj kuch aise hi sawaalon par charchaa karnaa chaahate hai
 What is constitution, what is our citizenship
 is sho kaa makasad yah bhi he ki lakhon aise chaatr jo apni garibi ke kaaran or amiri kii mouj masti ke kaaran samvidhan tak nahin pahunch pate hai unhen kuch phayda ho
 The picture of Udaipur in Rajasthan is not very old
 adaalat ke pravesh dwaar kii chat par bhagava dhvaj lekar noujvaan chadh jate hai
 The dock media secretly sidelined this picture
 adaalatein bhi chup rah gayi
 No judge remembers how the religious flag came inside the building run by the book of the Constitution
 uski chat par lahraane kaa dussahas kaise hua
 For this purpose, every kind of senior officer posted in the district should be dismissed from his job
 koi aapako nahin batayega ki jab is aarope main giraftaar ladke kii rihaai hui to use usee tarah shaan se waapas le jaaya gaya jis shaan se usne adaalat par bhagava dhvaj fahraaya tha
 This picture of the same Udaipur is only on 25 January
 phir se jatigat dhwaja liye ye noujvaan sadakon par jamaa hai
 Are they gathered for the dignity of the constitution or for the dignity of caste
 ek film itane naujavaanon ke bheetar jatigat swabhimaan jagaa detii he phir hamaare aapke bheetar koi sanvaidhanik swabhimaan bhi he, soya hua yaa aadha jaagaa hua hi sahi
 These people are two in one
 ek din jati ke naam par nikalate hai ek din dharm kii raksha ke naam par dadagiri karne ke liye nikalate hai
 When your elected leaders were seen standing in favor of the Constitution at such a time
 agar aap khud ko zimmedaar naagarik kehete hai to vah naagarikta kya he, uski zimmedaari kahaan se aati he, kya samvidhan se nahin aati he
 When you say that you are Indian and proud of it, what image emerges, of religion, of tradition and whether these images also include pride in the Constitution
 aapke bheetar kitni nishthaaen hai, kya jati or dharm kii nishthaaon ke saath samvidhan ke prati nishtha he yaa he hi nahin
 Is this confusion because you have not yet understood the constitution or many people or organizations have not resolved the clash of gundai in the name of constitution and traditions within you
 tippaniyan This is not the first time that the film is being opposed
 film kaa virodh is tarah se set ap kiya gaya he ki ek samudaay ke bheetar pehle jatigat nishtha paidaa ho jaae or phir use manzuri mili sampradayik nishtha se
 Both types of allegiance are working in it
 yahi nishtha he jo chunaav ke samay aapako yaad dilaati he ki vot sampradayik nishtha ke liye daalana he
 Why do we find our whereabouts in such devotions again and again? The film Padmavat has been debated in this country for three months
 pehle ise gujarat chunaavon kii prishthbhumi main chalaaya gaya or ab jab naujavaanon ke rojgaar ke sawaalon kaa vakt aa rahaa tha jo unke haath main mashaalen, talavaarein pakadaa di gayi
 You are getting weaker day by day
 aap jis bheed main hai usee bheed ke shikaar ho rahe hai
 The spokespersons of the organizations came to the studio debate with the sword, one day will also come with the gun
 yah set ap yani peeche se sajaayaa gaya masalaa na hota to rajyon ke mukhyamantri chup nahin nazar aate
 They would not have stood with armies formed in the name of Rajput caste
 mukhyamantri samvidhan ke saath khadaa dikhegaa yaa kisi jati kii sena ke saath

 Do these organizations not trust the Constitution to protect them? kya hamane samvidhan ko sansthaaon kii imaaraton main hi lagu kiya, kya ham jan jan main isaki bhaavana ko lagu nahin kar paae hai
 Why the verdict is still in the hands of the crowd, the credibility of the Supreme Court in the name of a film is at stake
 jin cinema maalikon ne film kaa pradarshan nahin kiya he kya unhone supreme court ko thukraa nahin diya he
 Have not rejected the constitution? We want to discuss some similar questions today
 samvidhan kya he, hamaari naagarikta kya he

 On 16 September, Prakash Javadekar has retweeted 43 tweets of the Prime Minister
 tippaniyan In a way you will see that the ministers of this government communicate with the public
 baat karte hai
 But watch carefully whether they talk about the work of their ministry, the people who want to say to them, if they say anything on it, then the answer will be no
 janata kii shikayaton kaa ambara laga he magar mantri ji bilkul notice nahin lete hai

 About 10 lakh bank employees are involved in this strike
 jisase sarkaar bainkon kii kareeb 87 hajaar shakhaaen band rahengi
 However, this strike will not affect the functioning of government bank atms and private banks

 The employees of the state-run bank are protesting against the government's proposed reforms
 da united forum of bank union ne maang kii he ki bank karmchaaree ousorcing par pabandi lagane or banking regaullation act par sarkaar phir se vichaar kare

 iske saath hi kshetreey or gramin bainkon ke vilay karne or unhen band karne kaa bhi bank karmchaaree virodh kar rahe hai
 The bank union alleges that the strike was decided only after negotiations with the government as well as the Indian Bank Association on their demands were inconclusive
 bank karmchaariyon kii union ne ye bhi saaf kar diya he ki sarkaar ne agar maange nahin maani to hadtaal ke baad baithak karke agali ranneeti par vichaar kiya jayega
 Among the superhit films of Amitabh Bachchan, Suryavansham's biggest identity has become it being shown repeatedly on the channel
 ise lekar soshal media par kai baar trol bhi kiya jaataa he
 The film has completed 21 years on Monday
 sawaal yahi uthta he ki aakhir suryavansham film main aisa kya he ki ise har duusare-tisare din dikhaaya jaataa he
 There are two reasons for this
 pehla yah ki jis saal film relies hui thi, usee saal maiks channel ko launch kiya gaya tha
 Both of them are getting the same time in the industry
 isliye channel ke adhikariyon kaa film se bhaavnaatmak lagaav he
 The second reason is that the channel has bought the rights to this film for 100 years
 isliye ise kabhi bhi dikhaane par kisi tarah kii koi roak-tok nahin he
 Deadpool 2 grossed 33 crores in 3 days, super hit Alia's Rajitisera It can also be said that the film is highly appreciated
 amitabh bachchan ne isamen behtareen adaakaari kii thi
 From the story to its editing and music is interesting
 bataa den ki film kii mukhya abhinetri saundarya raghu kaa nidhan ho gaya he

 china ne sanyukt raashtra main aatanki masood ajahar par bain lagane ke bharat kii koshishon ko samarthan dene se ek baar phir inkaar kar diya he
 China says it will not change its stand in the case of Masood Azhar
 yahi nahin, china philhal newclear saplyrs group (enesji) main bharat kii entry par bhi apane ravaiye ko badalane ke mood main nahin he
 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zeng Shuang gave this information in a media briefing
 jab unase bharat ke videsh sachiv es jaishankar ke bayaan ke bare main poocha gaya, to jeng ne kaha ki masood ajahar or enesji ko lekar bharat ke prati china apane rukh par kaayam he
 There will be no change in it
 bharat ne sanyukt raashtra main aplication dekarenesjior masood ajahar ke maamle main donon pakshon ke bich 'tarksangat or vyaavhaarik' baatcheet kii vakaalat kii thi
 But then China was against India's entry into the NSG
 china kaa tark tha ki agar bharat ko enesji main entry milti he, to pakistan ko bhi milani chahie
 China rejected the claim of India's entry into the NSG on the grounds that India had not signed the NPT
 aise main use enesji main shaamil nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Earlier, when Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Yu was asked that the purpose of this formula is to emphasize Pakistan's membership with India, he said, 'you are talking about India's news
 main jo kah rahi hum vah mahanideshak wang kun ne kaha he
 China has not fixed any status on the entry of any country not signing NPT
 isliye pehle sabhi gaiyr-enpiti deshon ko shaamil karne ko lekar prastaav hona chahie, phir kisi vishesh gaiyr-enpiti desh ke pravesh ke sambandh main

 'rahul gandhi ne pradhanmantri ke gale ko milaayaa galaa,lekin narendra modi ke paas he congress ko haraane kii kala
 Congress had completed 51, 52 or 55 years in power, then they have earned a lot of goods
 2014 main narendra modi ji ne kiya tha bahut bada kamaal,isliye desh main ho rahaa he vikaas kaa dhamal
 Congress is not well in the country, so Narendra Modi will win the year of 2019

 He said, 'I am also a player, Rajnath Singh is also a player
 congress ne jo ran nikaale hai, ham usase dabl ran banaaenge
 If the runs are reduced then we will also try to get runs, our party is Baba Saheb's party, BJP is not anti-dalit, Congress is also not anti-dalit
 ek-duusare par aarope lagane se kuch nahin hoga
 Rahul Gandhi is requested that he should support the government

 us-elected President Donald Trump dismissed Russia's report of sensitive information against him as "ridiculous" and said it may have been leaked by US intelligence agencies
 iske saath hi trump ne kaha ki agar unhone (khufia agenciyon) aisa kiya he to unke ricard par yah bada dhabba hoga
 "I think it would be a stigma if the information is made public," Trump said in his first formal press conference in the last six months
 maine soochna dekhi he, maine soochna us baithak ke baahar padhi thi
 "on the dossier related to Russia having sensitive information against them, the elected president said," This is fake news
 yah jaali dastavej he
 This never happened
 unhone yah mana ki democratic party ke computaron ko hack karne main rus or kuch anya deshon kaa haath tha
 "as far as hacking is concerned, i think it is Russia's job, but i think as far as hacking is concerned," he said in his multi-awaited press conference held just 9 days before he was sworn in as the 45th President of the US
 Some other countries have also done hacking
 trump ne kaha, deensi hekking ke liye puri tarah khulaa hua tha
 They acted very poorly
 unhone kaha ki republican neshnal cameti ko hack karne ke prayaas viff rahe or unhen safalataa nahin mili
 During this press conference, looking very restrained, Donald Trump said that his team is going to gather some great minds in the field of computers and increase security against hacking by foreigners
 media main is sandarbh main khabaren aane ke baad ki americakhufia agenciyonke pramukhon ne pichley hafte raashtrapati baraak obama or trump ko apusht rirpoton kaa saransh saunpa he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki rus ne trump ke khilaaf samvedansheel prakruti kii vyaktigat suchanaaen jutai hai
 Pointing to Moscow's response to the intelligence information leaks, Trump said that Putin and Russia said it was fake news
 unhone kaha, main is tathy kaa sammaan karata hum ki unhone aisa kaha
 If they had hacked the RNC, they would have released it
 trump ne kaha, agar putindonald trampako pasand karte hai, yah sampatti he, koi daayitv nahin
 i hope that between me and Putin come together, but there is a possibility that this will not happen
 trump ne kaha ki unka prashasan 90 dinon ke bheetar hekking par vistrut repotre jari karegaa
 Apart from yellow turmeric, there is another species of turmeric
 vah he kaali haldi
 Black turmeric is more useful in astrological remedies
 masalan, ghar main dhan-daulat se sambandhit koi pareshaani ho yaa bachche ko buree najar se bachaana ho
 Every problem can be overcome with black turmeric
 lekin kaali haldi kaa laabh uthaane ke liye ise siddh karnaa jaruri he
 Take a bath on the Ashtami of the black turmeric or the Ashtami of Krishna Paksha before the sun sets
 saaf kapade pahanakar purv disha kii ore cheharaa kar ke baithen
 Yes, but keep in mind that choose a place to sit from where there is no obstruction in the sight of the sun
 iske baad kaali haldi kii ganth kii puja dhoop-deep se karen
 Don't make your planet egoistic to you
 
 
 puja karne ke baad kaali haldi kii ganth ko pranaam karen or bhagwaan suryadev ke mantra 'om hrin suryaay nam:' kaa 108 baar laal chandan kii maala se jaap karen
 Use this daily till the next Ashtami
 ashtami ke din upwas rakhen or brahmanon ko bhojan karaaen
 In this way the lump of black turmeric will be proved
 jaane, kya he guru poornima kaa mahatv
 
 
 Use it in this way, this is the reason for wearing yellow clothes on Thursday
 
 
 kaali haldi ke 7 se 9 dane banaaen
 Thread them in a thread and keep them in the smoke of incense, google or frankincense for a while
 aisa karne ke baad use pahalen
 By doing this, the planets do not have any side effects and do not even look sorcery and evil eyes
 kisi naye kaam ke liye ja rahe hai to siddh kii hui kaali haldi kaa tikaa lagaakar jane se kaam main safalataa milane kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 If the child has a bad eye, tie a black turmeric knot in a black cloth and take it off seven times and flow it into the flowing water
 jaldi hi najar utar jaaegi
 If someone in the family is always ill, then make two pedas of flour on a Thursday and feed it to the cow by pressing jaggery and a little bit of black turmeric in it and take it off the patient 7 times
 isse laabh milegaa
 If you do not have money, then on the first Friday of the Shukla Paksha, put black turmeric, nagkasar and vermilion together in a silver box in front of the picture of Goddess Lakshmi
 thodi der baad is dibbi ko apane loker yaa cash box main rakh den
 This will keep Barkat
 yadi bijness main nuksaan ho rahaa he to ek pile kapade main kaali haldi, 11 gomti chakra, chaandi kaa sikaa va 11 kodiyaan baandhakar 108 baar 'uun namo bhagavate vasudev namah' kaa jaap kar dhan rakhane ke sthaan par rakhane se bijness main safalataa milane lagati he
 If your business is related to machines and the machines get spoiled on the day, then grind black turmeric and mix saffron and Ganges water in it and make a swastika mark on the machines
 is upaay se mashine jaldi kharaab nahin hongi
 Wrap the lump of proven black turmeric in a black cloth and hang it outside the main door of the house
 isse aapke ghar ko kisi kii najar nahin lagegi
 Also, there will be peace and peace in the house
 dhairya, ichha shakti or drudh nishchayta aapaki safalataa ke pul baandh sakati hai

 The historical victory of the Aam Aadmi Party surprised everyone
 kisi ne bhi aisa nahin sochaa tha ki party is tarah se congress hi nahin bijepi kaa bhi khaatmaa kar degi
 Even as the Congress swept the Delhi Assembly, the BJP had to face a crushing defeat
 party mahaj teen sadasyon tak simat gai
 This new party of Kejriwal taught the lesson of politics to the decades old party
 ab unki jeet or bijepi kii haar kaa vishleshan lambey samay tak chalata rahegaa
 Many reasons will be found and many types of theory will be given
 bijepi kii haar ke liye party ke bade netaaon kii nuktachini hoti rahegi
 Many analysts believe that the party's path to victory is now nearing its end
 tamaam baaten ek taraf
 The truth is that BJP should also see its victory in this defeat
 yah khatre kii ghanti thi jo samay par baj gai
 The party should go to Chet now
 use apane taur-tareekon ke bare main gaur karnaa hoga or aatmachintan karnaa hoga ki aakhir kya galat hua
 The party will have to demonstrate its power in Bihar and Bengal and it is necessary that it learns from its mistakes
 is chunaav main usne bahut sari galtiyaan kii or ek-ek karke unka use vishleshan karnaa hoga
 No political party wins elections only because of its leaders, if it wins, on the strength of its committed and grassroots activists

 This victory of the Aam Aadmi Party proved again
 lekin is baar dilli ke chunaav main bijepi ne apane kaaryakartaaon or netaaon kii bahut upeksha kii
 His words were not heard and all orders kept coming from above
 tikaton ke bantwaare main dal-badaluon ko jagah di gai or kaaryakartaaon kaa aatm bal girtaa gaya
 It seemed that the party is not a political party but a company which is run by its CEO
 yah party ke liye ghaatak sabit hua
 This election is giving the party a great opportunity for self-reflection
 agar vah aisa karti he or aage us par kaam karti he to koi vazah nahin ki vah behatar pradarshan na kare

 vah yahaan party dwaara yojit vijay shankhanaad raily ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 Modi said, "you guys make me not a Prime Minister and i will not let any pawn fall on the treasury of the country
" " modi ne kaha ki is desh main garibon kii jhopadi shahjade (rahul gandhi) ke purvajon ke karnaamon ke kaaran aabaad he
 Modi said, "if it took 60 years to reach half to full roti, it will take 100 years to reach full bread
 aap logon ne congress ko 60 varsh tak shashan karne kaa mauka diya
 Give 60 months time to BJP
 ham desh kii takadir or tasviir donon hi badal denge
 " modi ne kaha ki vah rone or aansu bahaane ke liye nahin aae hai
 He has pledged to wipe the tears of the poor and farmers
 modi ne raily main janata se poocha ki kya bundelkhand ke logon ke andar vikaas karne kaa dam nahin he? iskaa swayan hi jawaab dete hue modi ne kaha ki yahaan ke kisaanon main to dam he, lekin lakhanu or dilli kii sarkaron main dam nahin he
 Modi asked the central government of Delhi that while the Congress government is there, why did most farmers commit suicide
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki congress kii sarkaar ko gaanv, garib or kisaan kii parvaah nahin he
 The Congress distributes Revdis in the elections and talks about the package
 bundelkhand main yah package uttar pradesh ke netaaon kaa munh band karne ke liye aayaa tha
 On this occasion, Modi also tried to woo Muslims and Sikhs
 rahul gandhi ke haal main die gaye bayaan par nishaanaa sadhate hue modi ne kaha ki congress upaadhyaksh un muslim naujavaanon kaa naam bataaen jo pakistan kii khufia agency iesai ke sampark main hai, anyathaa un yuvakon se saarvajanik rup se maafee maangen
 Modi said that Congress President Rahul Gandhi has made serious allegations against the youth of Muzaffarnagar riots that some Muslim youth living in camps there are in touch with ISI
 unhone rahul se sawaal kiya ki centre main unki party kii sarkaar he
 If such a serious matter has come up, then what is the government doing? Modi said that Rahul should immediately declare the names of such people or else apologize to those youth of the country
 modi ne centre sarkaar kii khufia agenciyon par bhi sawaal uthaaya or kaha ki jo vyakti maatr saansad he or jisane gopneeyata kii koi shapath nahin lee he, khufia agenciyaan use desh kii gupt report kyon de rahi hai
 Modi also tried to garner the sympathy of the Sikh community
 unhone rahul gandhi ke us bayaan kii ore ishaara kiya, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki jab meri daadi (indira gandhi) maari gayi thim to mujhe bahut gussa aayaa tha
 Modi said that it is true that Rahul must have been angry at the killing of grandmother, Congressmen were also angry, but after that when his people killed thousands of Sikhs and burnt the youth alive, then He got angry too? If it had come, why have not any one been convicted in this case till date

 Terming the Congress as the root cause of corruption, senior BJP leader LK Advani asked party workers to be prepared for a long struggle to revive the country from a state of emergency and restore democracy
 dilli ke talkatoraa stadium main bhrashtachar, kalaadhan or sarkaar kii taanaashaahee ke khilaaf bhaajapa ke mahaandolan ko sambodhit karte hue adwani ne kaha, ‘pichley chah maheene se chaaron ore deshbhar main ghotaalon kii charchaa he
 For the first time, the Central Government minister not only has to resign but also has to go to jail and the government interprets it with pride
 ’unhone kaha ki videshon main jamaa kalaadhan desh main waapas laane ke liye ramlila maidan main baba ramdev ke andolan ko kuchalane ke liye bal prayog kiya jaataa he, bacchon evam mahilaon kii barbar tareeke se maaraa peeta jaataa he or pradhanmantri ise jaij tehraane kaa prayaas karte hai
 Taking a dig at the ruling party, the senior BJP leader said, "nothing is going to change by using sharp words on the Congress
" parivartan logon ke samarthan, hamaari dridhtaa or lagan se aayegaa
 We are fighting for democracy, not to remove any leader
 apatkaal jaisi sthiti main aaj sarkaar kii taanaashaahee ko samaapt karne ke liye sanyam kii jarurat he
 BJP has restraint and we will vigorously pursue our campaign against the government

 The action taken in these cases has taken place at the behest of the court
 sarkaar doshiyon ko bachaane main lagi hui he

 ' bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) naagarik sanshodhan kanoon (citizenship Amendment Act) par apane party ke samarthan ke stand ke baad enarasi ke mudde par centre sarkaar ko filhal samarthan dene ke mood main nahin hai

 However, in view of the split in the party, Nitish Kumar himself spoke to leaders like Pawan Verma who were criticizing the stand of the party on the issue, in view of the seriousness of the situation
 Rejected but also said that he is standing on his old stand on the NRC issue and the party will oppose it
 lekin saath hi saath nitish muslim samudaay main is bill ke paarit hone ke baad jo maahaul vyaapt he, khud muslim samudaay ke netaaon vidhayakon se ek clic par mil rahe hai or mana ja rahaa he ki agle ek do dinon main wo saarvajanik rup se charchaa bhi karenge
