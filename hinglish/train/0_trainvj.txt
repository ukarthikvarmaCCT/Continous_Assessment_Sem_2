 According to Ghaziabad Ala police officials, a missing report of a youth has been lodged at Khoda police station
 yuvak kii car meerut main ek encounter ke dauraan badmaashon se police ne baraamad kii thi
 However, no clue of the young man was found by the miscreants
 police ne jail main jaakar bhi badmaashon se poochtacha kii he
 It was learned that the miscreants found the car parked in unclaimed condition, which the miscreants had stolen
 or jis lokation se car chori kii gai thi vahaan ke aasapaas ke ilaake main bhi laapata yuvak krishna ko search kiya gaya
 But no clue of the young man was found by the police
 ab police jane ke margo or laapata yuvak ke rishtedaaron se poochtacha ke jariye yuvak kaa pataa lagane kaa prayaas kar rahi hai
 Six months have passed but the hi-tech Police of Ghaziabad, adjacent to Delhi, has also failed to find the young man
 kai sawaal police kii kaaryastylee par khadey ho rahe hai
 While the young man's car was recovered from the miscreants during the encounter in Meerut
 police ko badmaashon ko remand par gajiabad laakar badmaashon ke bayaan ko cross check karnaa chahie tha taaki badmaashon ke bayaan kii sachai saamne aa sake
 Let us tell you that the last location of the young man came around Mangal Bazar Chowk in Indirapuram
 or purv ke barsho main yahaan kai aisi ghatnaayen saamne ai thim ki badmaashon ne car sahit logo ko is ilaake se agava kar liya tha or meerut or uske aasapaas ke raaston par nashe kii haalat main phenk kar faraar ho gayi the
 After getting the car of the young man Krishna from the miscreants, it is also feared that the victim of any such incident has not become the missing youth
 barhaal yuvak kaa koi pataa kisi bhi tarah police nahin laga pai he
 Now the family of the young man is forced to visit the police station and police every day in the hope of meeting him

 isamen bhaajapa ke telugana rajya ke adhyaksh ji kishan reddy bhi shaamil the, jinhen ehtiyaat ke taur par hiraasat main le liya gaya
 Police officials said that the Archaeological Survey of India officials and government officials did not allow the BJP to unfurl the national flag at the fort
 bhagava dal maang karata rahaa he ki telugana sarkaar ko 17 sitambar ko aadhikarik rup se telugana swatantraaa diwas manaanaa chahie

 Shiv sena-ncp-congress leaders meet in Maharashtra as the final verdict on the Maharashtra government has intensified the political stir in Maharashtra
 congress, shivasena or ensipi gathbandhan par aaj yani shuukravaar ko muhar lag sakati he, lekin usase pehle ek badi jaankaree ye saamne aa rahi he ki agar mukhyamantri pad ke liye shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare nahin maanate hai to party ke saansad sanjay raut ye pad sambhaal sakate hai
 In the Shiv Sena, Sanjay Raut is leading in the race for CM post after Uddhav Thackeray
 isse pehle guuruuvaar ko hui baithak main ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ne shivasena chif uddhav thakare ko samajhane kii koshish kii ki unhen mukhyamantri ke rup main utarana chahie
 Shiv Sena mps Sanjay Raut and Aditya Thackeray, who were present in the meeting, also asked Uddhav to take over as CM
 shivasena, congress or ensipi kii baithkamaharashtra main pichley ek maheene se chalaa aa rahaa siyaasi drama ab khatm hone ko saktaa he
 After Delhi, there is a final round of meetings in Mumbai on Friday
 jahaan shivasena, congress or ensipi aapas main baithak bhi karenge
 It is believed that the formula of the new government will be announced in the shared press conference in the evening
 yah bhi takreeban tay he ki uddhav thakare hi agle mukhyamantri honge
 The three parties want the command of the veteran leader to be in the hands of the commanders, saying that the next Chief Minister of Kimhara would be Uddhav Thackeray
 darasal, shivasena hi nahin balki congress or ensipi bhi yahi chaahate hai ki maharashtra kii kaman uddhav thakare jaise anbhavi netaa ke haathon main di jaae, kyonki aditya thakare ko raajnneeti kaa gaharaa anubhav nahin he, unke siem banane se baaki donon dalon ke senior netaa jo mantri banenge, wo aditya ke saath asahaj mahasoos kar sakate hai
 The task of running the government with three parties cannot be put on Aditya's shoulder
 uddhav agar aise halaat main sharad pavaar or sonia gandhi ko sadhakar sarkaar bana sakate hai to paanch saal tak maharashtra kii sarkaar chalaa bhi sakate hai
 Therefore, sources say that the next Chief Minister of Maharashtra will be Uddhav Thackeray
 haalanki isaki aupchaarik elaan hona abhi baaki he
 Sanjay Raut said - public wants Uddhav to become CM Sanjay Raut once again said that Shiv Sena will be the Chief Minister
 raut ne kaha ki 5 maharashtra main 5 saal shivasena kaa hi siem hoga
 He said, everyone wants Uddhav Thackeray to take over as the chief minister, because this is what the public also wants
 iske alaava sirf shivasena main hi nahin balki teenon partiyon kii yahi maang he ki uddhav thakare kii mukhyamantri kaa pad sanbhaalein
 At present, the issue of 36 Rafale aircraft is the biggest public debate in the country

 Do not know how to strangle the truth, how many half-truths are floating in the air
 is tufaan main udyogpati anil ambani sabase bure fanse hai
 The entire controversy is centered around the Rs 30,000 crore 'offsets' that Dasso and his associates will have to spend with Indian manufacturers and this is not necessarily linked to the Rs 59,000 crore Rafale ships deal
 aarope yah he ki chote ambani kii pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saath nikatataa he
 For this reason, Dasso was given the indication that he would form a joint venture with Ambani's company to partner in a business of Rs 30,000 crore
 vaise is aarope main koi sachaai nahin he ki offessot kaa puraa kaam ambani kii company ko diya ja rahaa he
 The deal has been identified by partner French companies — Safran, Thales, Dasso Aviation — for 72 companies to offset
 aisi ummid kii ja sakati he ki ambani ko bhi acha-khaasaa kaam milegaa lekin is saude kaa sabase bada labhaarthi desh kaa sarkari sanghathan raksha anusandhan evam vikaas sanghathan yaa diardio hoga jise 9,000 karod rupye kaa kaam milane kii sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he
 Another major issue is that Ambani has no previous experience in defense manufacturing and most of his ventures have failed
 unki adhikansh group companiyaan khastahal vittiya sthiti main hai or march 2018 tak un par 1
 There was a huge debt of Rs 12 lakh crore
 itnaa hi kaaphi nahin tha, kuch sandigdh 'sanyog' bhi unke saath banate dikhte hai
 He formed his defense company on 10 April 2015, just 12 days before the announcement of the Rafale deal
 unki antertenment company ne purv francisi raashtrapati francwaj oland kii sangini or abhinayta juli gaaye dwaara nirmit ek film ko finance kiya tha
 Ambani's company announced this through a press release when Hollande came to India on 26 January 2017 as the chief guest of the Republic Day parade
 or yahi vah vajah he ki ambani logon ke nishane par aa gaye hai
 The talk did not stop at this
 oland ne pichley hafte ek francisi website mediapart ke saath baatcheet main yah kahkar aag main ghi daal diya ki ambani kii company ko daso kaa ofaset partner chune jane main unki koi bhoomika nahin thi, khud bharat sarkaar ne ambani kaa naam prastaavit kiya tha
 And this statement came when the Indian government insisted that the decision to make Ambani a partner was Dasso's own decision, the Indian government has no role in it
 iske baad apana daaman bachaane kii ghabrahat bhari koshishen shuru ho gayi or donon hi sarkarein kah rahi hai daso kise apana ofaset partner banaae, yah uskaa apana faisla tha
 No government had anything to do with this decision
 is saude se jude kai anya vivaadaaspad mudde bhi hai jo ise or pechida banaate hai
 What is the actual value of the ship? Is it cheaper than the amount that was set by the UPA government six years ago? Will the ships that were to be got fully equipped with weapons or not in the amount fixed by the UPA? When the UPA government was going on an agreement to buy 126 ships, why are we now buying only 36 ships? Why was HAL excluded from the deal when it was earlier involved? Has the Prime Minister truncated the government's procurement procedures by truncating it? The cover story of our executive editor and defense expert Sandeep Unnithan analyzes each aspect in depth
 baharhaal rafel ek gandi rajnatik chhintakashi kaa bahaanaa ban gaya he
 While there is no clear evidence of intermediaries or bribery in the deal, like the Bofors scandal, there is also no Swiss bank account or evidence of money transactions
 iske alaava, ye saare anubandh teen se paanch saal baad hi puure honge
 The Congress party feels that the claims of Prime Minister Narendra Modi proudly running a clean government free of corruption and crony capitalism, can damage this image of Rafael
 2014 ke aam chunaavon main jab modi pradhanmantri pad kii res main the, to upie sarkaar par bhi unhone aise hi aarope lagaae the
 As elections are getting closer, Rahul Gandhi is trying to attack Modi with the weapon of Modi
 kya inamen se koi bhi aarope tikega or chunaav kaa mudda ban paaegaa, iskaa uttar abhi milanaa baaki he
 But this much is evident at the moment the BJP is feeling itself on the backfoot
 is prakaar se keechad oochaalnaa, bharat kii bahupratikshit raksha kharidon ke liye acha nahin he
 Since this agreement has been reached between the governments of two countries with the efforts of the Prime Minister, therefore transparency will be the best route

 in chizon ke bina adhuri bhai dooj kii thali-bhai ke haathon main sindur or chaaval kaa lep lagane ke baad us par paan ke paanch pattey, supaari or chaandi kaa sikaa rakhaa jaataa he
 a spell is chanted for the brother's longevity by pouring water over him
 bhai apni bahan ko uphaar dete he
 It is important to have vermilion, flowers, rice grains, paan, suppani, coconut, flower garland and sweets in the sister's plate while taking the aarti of brother
 aise hui bhai dooj kii shuruyaat-bhai dooj ke vishay main ek puranic manyata ke anusaar yamuna ne isi din apane bhai yamraj kii lambii aayu ke liye vrath kiya tha or unhen annakut kaa bhojan khilaayaa tha
 According to the legend, the god Yama had seen his sister on this day
 yama kii bahan yamuna apane bhai se milane ke liye atyadhik vyakul thi
 Yamuna was very happy to see her brother
 yamuna ne prasann hokar apane bhai kii bahut aavbhagat kii
 Yama pleased and gave him a boon that on this day, if both brothers and sisters take a bath together in the river Yamuna, they will get liberation
 isi kaaran se is in yamuna nadi main bhai-bahan ke saath snaan karne kaa bada mahatv he
 Apart from this, Yama took a promise from Yamuna that on this day every brother should go to his sister's house
 tabhi se bhai dooj manaane kii pratha chali aa rahi he

 siikhaa ki jolly kaa matlab hota he vinodi swabhaav kaa hona
 People who keep their surroundings happy by joking around are called jolly
 kabhi ghar main koi bol detaa, bade jolly nechar kaa he ladkaa, to dil khush ho jaataa
 Then heard your name
 kuch baras pehle aap vidhayak the vijay jolly
 Then in the last assembly election, she reached Gol Market Assembly to defeat Sheila Dixit
 aapkaa daanv aadha sahi rahaa
 Got a lot of publicity
 mujhe ab bhi dhyaan he ki prachaar ke dauraan aap shila kaa aashirwad lene pahunche the
 i thought this is good political etiquette
 raajnneeti ke ve din yaad aa gaye, jab atal bihari, chandrashekhar, veepi singh or rajeev gandhi sareekhe log is shishtachar kaa khyaal rakhte
 On discovering Atal's treatment, Rajiv would send him to the US by joining him in the delegation
 veepi ke dialysis kaa pataa chalane par atal ames ke liye sarvottam mashin mangavate
 But no, i was wrong
 lagata to yahi he ki aap prachaar ke bhukhe ho or iske liye baharoopiyon kii tarah harakatein bhi karte ho
 Recently, you were the only one who had gone to meet Sheela Dixit with a basket of onions on Diwali
 tab bhi bas yahi khyaal aayaa
 Oh, this is a big jolly leader
 magar yah kya, aaj to aapane prachaar kii khatir had paar kar di
 Let's first tell you and everyone what you did
 ek patrkaar hai
 His name is Shoma Chaudhary
 tahalaka kii prabandh sampadak
 Till a few weeks ago, she was a champion of women's rights
 kabhi kisi tivi channel par, to kabhi kisi fest main
 But ever since Tehelka editor Tarun Tejpal came to know about the sexual harassment of a female journalist from the institute itself, your reaction to this issue came to the fore, we understood that another tussle has descended
 hamane-sabane shoma ke patrakarita ke mulyon par sawaal uthaae
 Criticized and put them in the dock of ideas
 tejpal kii is sharmnaak harakat par shuruaati satarkta ke baad media ne bhi khub kawarej kii
 In such a situation, Tejpal will be under police custody if not today
 shoma kii bhoomika kii police jaanch kii bhi baat uthne lagi he
 but
 
 
 aapane jo kiya vah
 
 
 Here, there is a big difference between our opposition and your infidelity
 shoma choudhary se goa police poochtacha kar chuki he
 He answered the police's questions
 media ke sawaalon ke jawaab de rahi hai or faraar nahin hai
 No summons has been issued to them
 phir aap kis baat ke kotwaal bane phirte ho vijay jolly
 You went to Shoma Chaudhary's house with your few supporters
 virodh ke pehle reportron ko ittala kiya
 When the cameras were assembled, they began to show off
 aapako ye bhi dhyaan nahin rahaa ki ek mahila ke khilaaf aparaadh ke liye aap jin shoma choudhary ke ghar par badtamiji kar rahe hai, vah bhi ek mahila hai or aap unki garima bhang kar rahe hai
 What kind of statement is this? shoma choudhary ko saket ke log or dilli ke noujvaan jahaan paaenge, pakad lenge or police ke hawaale kar denge
 You do not wear glasses
 to ye bhi najar aa hi rahaa hoga ki jab aap or aapke saathi vahaan gundai kar rahe the, tab shoma ko police suraksha main hi apni car tak janaa padaa
 Then where did the matter of handing over came from? vah to pehle se hi hai
 You have taken vessel on your political career, not on the name plate of Kalikh Shoma Chaudhary
 or is kaalikh ke chhinte aapaki party bijepi par bhi pade hai
 That is why Sushma Swaraj reacted immediately and strongly condemned your act and also mentioned the action on behalf of the high command
 magar nuksaan to ho chukaa he
 Till now morning, newspapers and headlines had talked about what your party did to Dr
 Harsh Vardhan for CM, bjp's recent change
 party ab takreeban har opinian pole main number van najar aa rahi he
 Harshvardhan is also the first choice
 aaj hi kii baat he, jab ek bade angreji akhbaar ke pehle panne par unki muskuraati si tasviir najar ai
 He was examining the ear of a child sitting on a mother's lap
 netaa nahin, doctor kii haisiyat se
 You also go to them
 kaan, aankh or naak kaa ilaaj karwaaie
 You seem to have lost the ability to see, smell and hear the difference between political possibility and stigma
 jolly, hamen yah kehane main gurej nahin ki aapaki yah harakat sharmnaak he
 If the allegations on Shoma are true, then they have definitely done wrong
 agency or intelligence apana kaam kar rahe hai
 But what you did with Shoma does not suit a leader at all
 so mistar jolly, you aar note at ol jolly
 You did not bow your head in shame while gossiping and gimmicking at a woman's house, but the political group of this country and the people choosing them have definitely bowed down

 sati or shiv kaa sambandh atoot tha
 Lord Shiva resided in the heart of Sati and Shakti
 lekin sati kii agnisamadhi ke baad jab shiv sati kaa sharir lekar samooche brahmad main bhatak rahe the, to jahaan sati kaa hriday gira, vahiin par mata amba kaa mandir bana
 Where Sati Mata's heart fell, it was the most sacred Shaktipeeth
 puranic manyata ye bhi he ki bhagwaan krishna kaa mundan nand-yashoda ne yaheen karavaaya tha
 Lord Rama and Lakshmana had passed through here in search of Sita Mata and it was here that Mata gave them the arrow to kill Ravana
 itnaa hi nahin valmiki muni ne ramayana likhane kii shuruyaat isi tapobhumi se kii thi
 Devotees invite Mother to Bhado Purnima has a special significance in Ambaji because from this day devotees invite Mother to come to their home for Navratri
 bhakt yahaan bhagwati kii pataakaa lekar aate hai or maa ke mandir main chadhaate hai, maa ko apane ghar bulaate hai
 It is the glory of Ambe that no devotee who comes here returns empty handed
 lekin is mandir kii sabase khaas baat ye he ki yahaan garbhagrih main maa kii murti kii nahin balki yantra kii puja kii jaati he
 The device of Amba Devi is kept secret, which is also prohibited to be seen in the open
 pujari ankhon main pattee baandhakar isaki puja karte hai
 In Shaktipeeth Ambaji, the Navratri festival begins with the full moon of Bhado and is seen during the Navratri
 yahi vajah he ki ‘jai jai ambe’ ke ghosh ke saath yahaan lakhon bhakt paidal chalakar maa ke darbar main dastak dene aate hai
 Amba is also a devotee of Maa, Jeetubhai, in whose life the mother performed a miracle that she did not even expect
 20 saal se goongi inaki bahan kii aawaaj aa gai or unhone maa ke darbar main hajir hokar shraddha suman arpit karne kaa faisla kiya
 He went out to visit Amba Mata with millions of devotees chanting the mother
 ‘jai jai ambe’ ke jaighosh karte, sharir par gulaal male or maa kii chunni lapete lakhon bhakt bhado poornima ke din amba mata ke mandir pahunchane ke liye paidal nikalate hai
 Lakhs of devotees from different states of the country, carrying flags and flags in their hands, are absorbed in the hymns of the mother and move to the darshan of the mother
 pairon par padate chhaale hon yaa phir lambii yatra kii thakaan, maa ke darshanon ke liye aatur in bhakton ko kisi baat kii koi chintaa nahin rahati
 All the devotees make their own small pieces and bring the chariot of mother Amba along with them
 jab lambii padayatra ke baad bhaktajan mandir tak pahunchate hai to maahaul kisi utsav se kam nahin hota
 The devotees reach the court of the mother by chanting hymns on the lips of the garba, chanting the hymns of the mother on the lips, and shouting 'jai Jai Ambe'
 desh ke 52 shaktipeethon main se ek ambaji shaktipeeth he, jiskaa zikr shastron main bhi aayaa he
 It is said that Sati Mata's heart fell on the site of this temple of Ambaji and Shaktipeeth was built here
 yahaan par shringaar or puja bhi khaas tarah se kii jaati he
 In the morning, worship is done in the afternoon, in the afternoon in the form of youth and in the evening there is the adult form
 isi puja archana kaa chamatkaar hi he ki yahaan se aaj tak koi khaali haath nahin lautaa
 In Ambaji, there is a special tradition of bringing flag flags along with walking on Bhado Purnima
 bhakt chote-chote jhande or 52 gaj lambii dhwajaaen lekar mata ke mandir par chadhaakar apni bhakthi vyakt karte hai
 All the devotees who walk on foot to the temple of Amba Mata consider it their good fortune to join with the aarti of mother Amba, and the devotees consider their journey a success only after seeing the aarti

 ’pakistani media ne haalanki yah bhi likhaa ki is yatra se donon pakshon ke bich 26 / 11 ke mumbai hamalon kii jaanch jaise vivaadaaspad muddon ko sulajhane ke liye manch taiyaar hona chahie
 On the front page of all Pakistani newspapers, a picture of smiling Zardari has been printed in which he is shaking hands with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 raashtrapati kii ravivaar ko ek divasiy bharat yatra ke dauraan singh ke saath unki mulaakaat ke bare main prakashit reporton main kaha gaya he ki bhartiya netaa ne jaradaari kaa paak daure kaa nimantran sweekaar kar liya he
 On the other hand, Zardari has agreed to India's demand for more action against terrorists settled on the soil of Pakistan
 di express tribune ne apane shishark main likhaa he, ‘jeyudi ke saaye main, singh ne sweekaar kiya paak kaa nyauta
 On the other hand, the influential Dan Dain has taken the top of its report, "work hard to find love, lesson to Zardari in Delhi
" ’jaradaari kii yatra par da don ne apni report main kaha he ki raashtrapati ne ‘ajmer main khwaja moinuddin chishti kii dargah par jiyaarat se pehle lajiz bhoj kaa lutf uthaaya lekin unki bharat kii ek divasiy nijee yatra mezbaan ke is ishaare ke saath sampann hui ki bharat kaa pyaar paane ke liye abhi unhen or mehnat kerani hogi
 'the Express Tribune has stated in its report that Singh has accepted Zardari's invitation to visit Pakistan but at the same time New Delhi has reiterated its demand that' Islamabad punish the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attack
 jo jamaat ud daawa ke pramukh hafiz said kii ore saaf ishaara he
 The News wrote in its editorial titled 'A personal journey' that this was the first visit by a Head of Pakistan to India in the last seven years
 saath hi yah bhi likhaa he ki aise do deshon ke netaaon ke bich mulaakaat kaa intjaam karana aasaan nahin tha jo saamaanya taur par antarrashtriya rajanyik aayojanon ke dauraan hi haashiye par aapasi baatcheet kar lete hai
 The editorial states that the visit was undertaken last year with a high degree of vigilance between the business communities of the two countries with the aim of broadening the scope of business relationships which are part of strengthening mutual confidence building measures
 haalanki iskaa spasht zikr nahin kiya gaya tha
 The News and Pakistan Today have also given criticism in their editors about the criticism of Zardari's expenditure on the visit
 da news or pakistan today ne likhaa he ki jaradaari ke saath ek vishaal pratinidhimandal bharat daure par gaya jisamen unka betaa tathaa pakistan pipuls party pramukh bilaval bhutto jaradaari bhi shaamil hai jo kisi sarkari pad par nahin hote hue bhi is daure main shaamil the
 The media has written that the size of the President's delegation and the expenditure on its movement raises some questions as to whether it was indeed a 'private' visit
 da daily times ne ‘aadhyatmik yatra’ sheershak vaale sampadakeey main likhaa he ki jaradaari kii is yatra se donon deshon ke bich vivaadaaspad muddon ko sulajhane kaa manch taiyaar hona chahie jinamein mumbai hamalon kii jaanch tathaa nadi jal bantwaare kaa mudda bhi shaamil he
 Pakistan Today, The Express Tribune and Daily Times have written that an avalanche at the Siachen Glacier on the eve of Zardari's visit has left 135 people, including 124 Pakistani soldiers, dead
 media ne aahvaan kiya he ki duniya ke sarvaadhik unchai par sthit sard yuddh kshetra ko sena mukt kiya janaa chahie
 The Express Tribune, in its editorial, praised the ppp-led government for writing that it 'in a great way improved relations damaged after the 26 / 11 Mumbai attacks, while the war was unfolding
 ’media ne likhaa he, ‘ati mahatvakankshi hone kaa prayaas karne ke bajaay sarkaar ne satarkta se vyapaar or niyamit ucch stareey baithkon ke madhyam se inch dar inch aage badhate hue shanti kii ore chote chote kadam uthaae
 'it has been written that Zardari's meeting with Singh is' another sign that both countries are moving strongly towards establishing lasting peace 'and that both countries are' fortunate to have leaders who are at peace Committed to the process but that does not mean that there is no danger around

 5 starkalakaarvarun dhawan, shraddha kapur or prabhu devadyrectorramo disujamsala film bananaa alag baat he, or kisi ek hi art par focus film bananaa alag
 If the subject is dance and the land is Bollywood, then steps should be kept alive
 jaisaa 'abisidi' (ani bady can dance) ke pehle part main remo disuja ne kiya tha
 But this time Remo succumbed to the same syndrome that most Bollywood directors have
 chamak-dhamak
 When the sequel became a hit, the next film featured big stars and a big budget
 yaheen aakar maamla ulajhane lagata he, bade plateform ke chakkar main majaa kirkira hota najar aata he or is tarah lagbhag dhai ghante kii film kisi dance reality sho ke phinale jaisi lagane lagati he
 Seeing that the first film was made by Dil, 'ABCD-2' has been forced to success by box office
 kahani main kitna damavarun dhawan or shraddha kapur ek dance group kaa hissaa hai or ve ek mukaable main hissaa lete hai
 During the match, they show the act of some other group
 badanaami kaa daag lag jaataa he
 Society makes life difficult
 phir varun los vegas ke hip hop mukaable main haath aajamaane kaa faisla letaa he
 Prabhu Deva comes
 phir los vegas kaa safar
 Remo fails to tie the story through, and it seems that as a choreographer, he wants to get to the dance as soon as possible
 film kii length bhi zyada he, or yahi baat tang karne lagati he
 ABCD was a worthy attempt to bring the dance genre in Bollywood to the main stream, while the film looks just like its expansion
 jo conect nahin kar paati he
 The film directors should understand that if the film is more than two hours, then its story should be strong, otherwise the audience gets so much time that they start looking for the story in the film
 star apilavarun dhawan kaa dance acha he
 Suresh had a good liking for the role
 lekinactingke morche par ab bhi ve dialog delivery main chook jate hai
 Of course six pack abs are good, dance is good, now Varun should go on acting a bit
 shraddha kapoorcchhi lagati hai, lekin vah acting ko thodaa nikhaaren to kamaal kar sakati hai
 They have tried to dance well, but professional dancers are around them, so they get a little discolored
 prabhu deva to achche hai hi
 They look fun
 baaki vishnu sar ke bare main kehane se zyada dekhnaa hi thik he
 Raghav Jual, Dharmesh, Lauren Gottlieb and Puneet have made a lot of recognition through TV
 lekin inase acting mat karaie
 It is the opinion of the film world that with a film, the director and actor's attitude changes
 abisidi jahaan remo kii dance film kii pehali koshish thi, vahiin abisidi-2 tak ve bataur diarector ek bada naam ban chuke the
 In this way he needed famous stars
 film ko kisi bahaane se videsh bhi le janaa tha, to use los vegas le gaye
 Then the 3D factor is there from the very beginning
 is tarah abisidi jahaan lagbhag 12-15 karod ru
 ABCD-2 budget was about 60 crores
 bataaya ja rahaa he
 In this way they have played big bets on weak story
 dance premiyon ko isamen majaa aa saktaa he lekin kahani premi to niraash hi honge

 Gadkari said that apart from this, there are other projects aimed at increasing connectivity with countries of South Asia and ASEAN
 (input bhashaa se) Recently, many such strange incidents have come to the notice, which can make someone's hair stand out
 beete dinon ek aisi hi ajeebogareeb ghatana hui, jisamen ek patni ne apane pati ke privet part yani 'pennish' ko kaat diya
 The strange thing is that the wife had cut her husband's penis a few days ago, which the doctors had added through surgery
 lekin patni is kadar gusse main thi ki usne dobaaraa apane pati ke privet part par hamalaa bol diya
 Such incidents have been reported from many countries of the world
 lekin in sab ke bich bada sawaal ye ki aisi ghatana ke shikaar mardon ko kis maansik or shaareerik kashton se guzarana padataa he
 Can such men return to normal life? Can the sex life of a man suffering from such incidents be normal or whose private parts are linked with the help of surgery, what kind of problems they have to face
 aise hi kuch buniyadi sawaalon ke jawaab dhudhane kii yahaan koshish kii gai he
 How much pain is there? In this injury, removal of the penis without removing the testicle is like mental torture for the victim
 aise main peedit mard yon kuntha ke shikaar ho jate hai
 a man without penis is like a gun without a bullet
 aise main mard apane saathi ko santusht bhi nahin kar pate
 Men who have undergone surgery also face problems such as difficulty in riding the bike
 aisi sthiti aane par kya hai upyurologist professor raaj prasad ke mutabik, aisi choton se ubharne ke liye ye dekhnaa jaruri he ki chot kis hisse par zyada he
 Reconnecting the veins of the penis is a very difficult task, as the corporal tissues present in the penis are very fine
 corporal tissue hi irection main madad karte hai
 Can Shredded Penis Be Reintroduced? Experts show that chopped penis can be reintroduced with the help of surgery
 lekin ye behad hi pechida hota he
 In many cases it is not successful
 surgery ke baad bhi pennish pehle kii tarah kaam nahin karata
 According to a Chinese research, 50 patients' penises were combined by surgery, in which only one patient was able to have a perfectly healthy orgasm
 agar pennish joda naa ja sake to kyajin maamalon main pennish ko surgery kii madad se waapas joda nahin ja saktaa, vaise maamalon main doctor ek nayaa pennish banaate hai
 For this, doctors take the help of the victim's flesh and tissue
 lekin aisa pennish thik nahin mana ja saktaa he
 Can a victim have sex? This is the most important question that usually comes to the victim's mind
 ek chini shodh kii maane, to aisa puri tarah se sambhav nahin he
 In many cases it is not possible for the victim to have sex
 peshaab karne main kya dikkat aegiaisi ghatnaon se jujhne vaale shaks ke liye ye ek badi samasya he
 This is a big question, how will a person without a penis urinate
 visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki agar pennish ko dobaaraa banaaya gaya he, to peedit vyakti saamaanya mard kii tarah khadey hokar peshaab kar saktaa he
 But if the penis has not been properly connected or formed, the doctors remove the urine pipe through the testicles with the help of operation
 aisa ho jane ke baad peedit vyakti kya courejaisa kaha jaataa he ki peedit vyakti dhire-dhire saamaanya jivan jeene lagata he
 But it can take a long time for the victim to recover from such an incident
 kai baar peedit vyakti gahare sadame main bhi chalaa jaataa he
 It is better to treat such a person in a normal way, so that he does not have to face any kind of frustration

 It is true that when the Punjabi Muslim of Pakistan dies on the border, then Pakistan awakens, and when the others die, it also refuses to take responsibility

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator In the 'kamal' session, Congress President Kamal Nath will blossom from the stage of Panchayat Aaj Tak Madhya Pradesh, said that Congress leaders also have the sentiment of Hindutva but the party never made it through politics
 aaj agar ham apni bhaavana ke tahat mandir ja rahe hai tobijepike pet main kyon dard ho rahaa he
 Has BJP taken the contract of Hinduism
 kamalnath ne kaha kirahulji ne farvari main kaha tha ki unki bhaavana he ki wo kailas maansarovar yatra par jaaen
 He went but BJP also questioned him
 kamalnath ne kaha ki maine apane kshetra main pradesh kaa sabase bada hanuman mandir banwaaya lekin kabhi uskaa prachaar nahin kiya
 Never made it an issue in the media
 shivbhakt rahul, narmadabhakt congress ke poster par kamalnath ne kaha ki aise poster ham nahin laga rahe lekin hamaare kaaryakarta agar laga bhi rahe hai to ye unki bhaavana he lekin bijepi ko isamen aapatti kyon ho rahi he
 Has the BJP taken the contract of Hinduism, which has sat as a wholesale distributor
 kamalnath ne kaha ki aaj main mandir bhi jaataa hum to media vahaan pahunch jaati he lekin ham hameshaa se mandir jate rahe hai isamen nayaa kya he
 Why should the BJP or anyone object to it
 gauratlab he ki panchayat ajtak madhyapradesh ke tahat rajdhani bhopal main saje manch par congress or bijepi ke diggaj netaaon, rajya kii raajnneeti ke centre main aa gaye sadhu-santon va anya hastiyon ne agle maheene hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ko lekar jari charchaa main hissaa liya or sawaalon ke jawaab die
 Among the celebrities who gathered on this platform were Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Cabinet Minister in the Union Government Narendra Singh Tomar, Congress President Kamal Nath, former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh, BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala etc

 ) (this news has not been edited by the NDTV team
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) gadhwaghat ashram varanasi main he
 The number of followers of this ashram is in crores, mostly of Dalit and backward societies, especially Yadavs
 isaki badi vajah ye he ki is ashram ko bhagwaan krishna ke vanshajon kaa mana jaataa he
 Hence, the leaders of almost all parties started coming here from time to time
 yahi nahin is peeth se kai bade rajanetaaon kii aasthaa bhi judi hui he
 Leaders like Rahul Gandhi to Rajnath Singh have come here
 sapa ke sangrakshak mulaayam singh yadav aksar yahaan aate rahe hai to 2017 main vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan piem narendra modi pehali baar gadhwaghat ashram pahunche the or yaheen se apane chunaav prachaar ke abhiyaan kii shuruyaat bhi kii thi
 And now once again Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Aditya Nath is giving his knock here
 pradesh main 2014 ke chunaav ke rigelt ko dohraane ke liye sangharsh kar rahi bijepi ne bahut soch samaj kar ye rasta chunaa he
 It is no coincidence that the top BJP leaders come to the biggest seat of the Yadavs
 iske jariye bijepi yadav samaaj ko ek sandesh dena chaahati he
 The BJP wants those Yadavs, who hold the greatest status in the OBC category, to be added to them, who are still considered as the voters of the Samajwadi Party
 chunki 2014 main sapa or basapa alag- alag lard rahi thi or bijepi aasaani se daliton ko apane taraf karne main kaamyaab ho gai thi lekin is baar paristhiti alag he sapa-basapa na sirf ek saath hai balki yadav vot golband bhi nazar aa rahaa he aise main bijepi daliton ke saath yadav voton ko bhi saadhane kii koshish kar rahi he jisase sapa-basapa ke gathbandhan par asar daalaa ja sake
 Yadav cannot say how much impact this will have on the votes, but after meeting Yogi, Sant Sharananand of the Garhwaghat Ashram said his emphasis on nationalism
 media se baatcheet ke dauraan unhone kaha ki har deshvasi ke liye desh pehle jaruri he
 Hindustan is a Hinduist nation and it is our duty to protect its identity
 swami sharnanand kii ye baat bijepi ko utsahit kar sakati he kyonki mana jaataa he ki ashram kii ek awaz par yadav samaaj uth khadaa hota he
 In such a situation, the talk of Swami Sharanand's nationalism suits the BJP
 yogi varanasi ke apane is daure main sirf ashram hi nahin gaye balki varanasi ke purv meyar rahe kanhaiya laal yadav ke ghar bhi unka haal-chaal lene pahunche the
 Even after reaching there, he has tried to give a message to the Yadav society
 lekin kya yah itnaa aasaan he centre kii modi sarkaar ho yaa phir rajya kii yogi sarkaar, yadav haashie par hai
 In the Yogi cabinet, only Girish Yadav has got the rank of Minister of State
 iske alaava ek bhi mahatvapurn pad par yadav samaaj ke netaa paas nahin he
 Not only this, people of Yadav society are angry with Yogi government for transfer, posting too
 unhen lagata he ki sapa se nazdikiyon kii vajah se unke saath bhedbhaav kiya ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, whether the Yadav fraternity will embrace the BJP is a big question, despite this, the BJP is looking at the Garhwaghat Ashram as a new laboratory in Purvanchal politics to get the Yadav votes on its side
 sutara ye bhi kah rahe hai ki bijepi kii koshish he ki piem modi ke prastaavak ke rup main ashram ke hi disha nirdesh par koi yadav samaaj kaa vyakti ban jaye

 There was not even a ruckus on the statement made by Dayashankar Singh that two more Bahujan Samaj Party mlas had accused Mayawati of demanding money in lieu of tickets
 basapa ne aarope lagane ke kuch hi ghante baad donon vidhayakon ko suspend kar diya
 Romi Sawhney and Brijesh Verma held a press conference in Lucknow on Wednesday alleging that Maiyawati and Nasimuddin Siddiqui demanded Rs 5 crore and 4 crore in exchange for giving them the ticket for the assembly elections
 romi saahani lakhimpur khiri jile ke palia vidhansabha kshetra se vidhayak hai or brijesh verma hardoi jile ke mallaavaan se vidhayak hai
 Both the mlas accused of demanding 5 crores from Sahni and 4 crores from Verma alleged that on 6 July, Mayawati called both mlas in turn
 mayawati kii maujuudagi main nasimuddin siddiki ne romi saahani se 5 karod rupee or brijesh verma sechaar karod rupaamange
 He said that when he told Mayawati that he was not able to pay that much money, he was asked to prepare to contest the Lok Sabha elections instead of the assembly
 bispi vidhayakon main mayawati kaa khauf: sahniromi saahani ne kaha ki mayawati ko lekar bispi ke vidhayakon main khauf he or kai vidhayak biimaar ho gaye hai
 Regarding the performance of Bahujan Samaj Party on Dayashankar Singh's case, these mlas said that the BSP carries the same slogans which are written
 party ne donon baagiyon ko kiya suspendbspi ne in donon vidhayakon ko baghawat karne ke baad party se nishkasit kar diya he
 The statement issued by the BSP said that these two mlas were also expelled from the party earlier and returned on the condition that they would not ask for the assembly ticket
 paise maangane ke aarope ko party ne anargal bataaya
 Recently, senior BSP leaders Swami Prasad Maurya and RK Chaudhary have also left the party accusing Mayawati of demanding money

 shuukravaar ko badi sankhya main chaatro ne hamase sampark kiya ki unka centre 1500 kimi dur diya gaya he or ve 2000 rupee kharch karne kii kshamta nahin rakhte hai
 If you go to the Twitter handle of the Railway Minister and the Railway Ministry, then there is a flood of complaints in which students are pleading with the Railway Minister that their center should not be kept away or else the examination will be missed
 pehle aap dekhie ki teen din baad is samasya par rail mantralay ne kya jawaab diya he
 According to their official reply, more than 47 lakh candidates have applied for this exam
 inamen se lagbhag 34 lakh yani 71% se adhik aavedakon ko 200 kilometre ke andar hi pariksha centre die gaye hai
 Particularly noteworthy is that 99% of the differently-abled and women have been given examination centers within 200 km
 isi tarah thodaa or aage badhkar 500 kilometre ke andar lagbhag 83% yani lagbhag 40 lakh aavedak samyojit kar liye gaye hai
 And only 17% of the applicants have been allotted more than 500 km distance centers
 railway ne apni press reelij main 40 lakh tak sankhya to bataa di lekin 500 kilometre se adhik duuri ke centre waalon kaa pratishat hi bataaya
 Such students are just 17 percent
 ye 17 pratishat hota he kareeb 8 lakh
 8 lakh students are worried that they have to go to Telangana from Katihar, go to Bangalore and go to Jodhpur
 kya yah kam sankhya he, saamaanya baat he ki 8 lakh chaatro ko itani dur bhej den ki unamem se kai chaatr tikat kataane kii sthiti main na hon
 What is the arrangement that if 8 lakh people have to travel 2000 km and 40 lakh people have to travel less than 500 km, then it was a system of equality from the government
 railway ne kaha he ki kuch rajyon se aavedakon kii sankhya vahaan uplabdh pariksha kendron kii kshamta se bahut zyaada he
 Like 9 lakhs from Bihar, 9 from Uttar Pradesh
 5 lakh tathaa rajasthan se 4
 There are 5 lakh applicants
 in rajyon main sisitivi, frisking, metal detector aadi kii suvidha vaale upyukt pariksha kendron kii sankhya itani nahin he
 It is also worth mentioning that the candidates from these three states who have applied in the beginning have got the nearest centers, while those who have applied later have been allotted the distant centers

 railway ne kaha he ki yah dhyaan rakhaa gaya ki unhen behatar yatayaat suvidha vaale mukhya shaharon main hi pariksha centre aavantit kiye jaaen
 Has the Railways really taken care of it? bihar ke saaran zile ke chaatro kaa centre padaa he tirupati
 Talked to a student and also listen to his train schedule

 Mohan's exam is on August 21
 agar use patna se tirupati ke liye jane vaali ernakulam express lenaa hoga to 14 agast kaa tikat lenaa padegaa

 He will leave Siwan for Patna on August 18, the bus takes 8-9 hours
 18 agast kii shaam patna se kolkata ke liye ravaanaa hoga
 After reaching Kolkata, you will wait for the train for 8 hours Tirupati which will run on Sunday
 19 agast ko kolkata se ravaanaa hokar 20 agast yani somvaar raat 8 baje pahonchega
 In this way, Mohan will travel for 37 hours and will wait 8 hours on the platform
 kul milakar 18 agast se lekar 20 agast ke bich 45 ghante safar main lagenge
 Having taken a ticket for General Bogie, one way fare will be around 1200
 agar aap is tarah se dekhenge to railway kaa yah daawa sahi nahin jaan padataa ki chaatro ko behatar yatayaat suvidha vaale mukhya shaharon main hi pariksha centre aavantit kiye gaye hai
 If the train is late, it will bear its stress separately
 mohan ke pita kheti karte hai
 Reaching the examination center by spending three days and three to four thousand is not easy for millions of students like Mohan
 railway ke hi hisaab se aise chaatro kii sankhya 8 lakh he
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has not yet spoken to the Railway Minister for these students
 railway ne ye samaj liya he ki ye samasya sirf bihar kii he isliye bihar ko lekar jawaab diya he
 While we have also received complaints from students of UP and Rajasthan

 In addition to these 2292 vacancies, the candidates of Bihar have also applied for the vacancies of other Railway Recruitment Boards of the country, so they have also been allotted to the examination centers of other states as per the availability
 online pariksha kaa matlab kam se kam apane rajya ke bheetar to honi hi chahie
 If 9 lakh students travel this way and reach the examination, then what will happen to them

 3000 rupees is a lot for them
 aara shahar main kai chaatr gaanv gaanv se aakar group study karte hai
 Many students come here cycling 8 to 10 km to save 20 rupees for the fare
 ye amir ghar ke bachche hote to yahaan maidan main machhar makkhi se katwate hue taiyaari ke liye nahin jamaa hote
 This is a picture of Revelganj Chapra
 yahaan bhi chaatr kai kimi se aakar samuhik adhyayan karte hai
 Cycling 7 to 10 km to come and read
 in sabaki aarthik sthiti aisi nahin he ki paanch paanch hazaar kharch kar imtahaan dene ja saken
 If you are not sure, look at this blue shirt
 ye atm guard kii kameez he jise maheene kaa 3500 miltaa he
 Explain that his child can spend 4000 to go to Bangalore
 ek baat sochie to sahi ki wo is vakt kitna tanaav main hoga
 It is a two-day trip, he has not received a ticket
 ye kuch gharon kii tasviir he jisase aap andaaza kar sakate hai ki chaatr kin gharon se aate hai jo railway kii pariksha dene ja rahe hai
 If one is not getting a ticket, one is not getting a reservation
 kam se kam mahanagaron ke darshak or saansad mukhyamantri andaaza karen ki garib ghar ke chaatro par imtahaan dene ke liye paise kaa bhaar kyon daalaa ja rahaa he
 i am weak in Mathematics, but Shivank calculated that if 4 lakhs could not go for examination, then Rs 100 crore could be earned by filling the form of 100 rupees
 aath lakh chaatr pareshaan ho gaye hai
 This number is according to the railways
 bahut se chaatr jinke farm ajeeb ajeeb kaarnon se riject ho gaye hai wo phone karke rone lagate hai ki unke chaar saal barbaad ho gaye
 Nowhere in the press release that Railways has released today, it is written that options will be given to change the examination center
 isliye chaatr idhar udhar kii jaankariyon par dhyaan na den
 So far, it is reported that the Railways have not decided to change their center
 sudeep samant ne rail mantri ko twit kiya he ki ve bangaloru ke rahane vaale hai magar unka centre kolkata diya gaya he
 How has this happened? is duusare twit main avinaash ne railmantri ko kaha he ki ve bangaleru main rahete hai magar pariksha kaa centre bhopal de diya gaya he
 Please allow change of center
 chandigarh ke krishna kumaar ne rail mantri ko twit kiya he ki unka centre 1600 kimi dur kolkata de diya he
 Saurabh Singh tweeted that Bhubaneswar's student center was lying in Gujarat, it would have been nice to have been sent to New York
 rajasthan sikar ke kumaar ashok kaa centre amritsar de diya he
 Naveen has tweeted that he is a resident of Delhi but the Orissa Center is lying

 Therefore, it does not seem right to call this problem Bihar-centric
 bangaleru ke chaatr ko bhopal dene kaa kya matlab he
 What does it mean to give Chandigarh to Kolkata? shivank ne itani madad na kii hoti to railway ke jawaab ko lekar itane sawaal nahin uthte
 If the railway is firm on its decision then it will have its own understanding, but due to the problem that is reaching us, we feel that the poor students are having fun
 chaar-chaar saal baad imtahaan dene kaa mauka aayaa he or wo bhi imtahaan dene ke liye haftaa bhar pehle ghar se nikalnaa pade ta phir unki pareshaani ko notice main lenaa chahie
 At least the railway minister should check his Twitter handle
 yahi nahin railway ke parikshaarthi puch rahe hai ki jinhone 500 rupee farm ke bhare the unka 400 rupaya kab waapas milegaa
 You may remember that the price of the first form was 500, but when we questioned in prime time that the form of UPSS with IAS examination is Rs 100 and for Group d examination, the form of 500 is unfair
 railway ne turant 100 rupaya kar diya or kaha ki baaki 400 rupee waapas honge
 Did not return till today

 lekin aakhri saal main bataaya jaataa he ki unka course AICTE se part time he
 The students are right that why they were given wrong information from the university that the course is full time

 In a way, the future of these students has reached the verge of ruin

 Students say that until their demand is not met, full time degree will not be given, then each student will start a hunger strike
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki unhen pataa nahin tha ki part time he
 When a senior was appointed in BENGAL ELECTRICITY BOARD, he was not given a job because it was said that your course is part time approved by AICTE
 chaatro ne uniwarsity se sawaal poochna shuru kar diya
 When the answer was not received, they came out on the movement

 railway ne apni press reelij main 40 lakh tak sankhya to bataa di lekin 500 kilometre se adhik duuri ke centre waalon kaa pratishat hi bataaya
 Such students are just 17 percent
 ye 17 pratishat hota he kareeb 8 lakh
 8 lakh students are worried that they have to go to Telangana from Katihar, go to Bangalore and go to Jodhpur
 kya yah kam sankhya he, saamaanya baat he ki 8 lakh chaatro ko itani dur bhej den ki unamem se kai chaatr tikat kataane kii sthiti main na hon
 What is the arrangement that if 8 lakh people have to travel 2000 km and 40 lakh people have to travel less than 500 km, then it was a system of equality from the government
 railway ne kaha he ki kuch rajyon se aavedakon kii sankhya vahaan uplabdh pariksha kendron kii kshamta se bahut zyaada he
 Like 9 lakhs from Bihar, 9 from Uttar Pradesh
 5 lakh tathaa rajasthan se 4
 There are 5 lakh applicants

 It is also noteworthy that the candidates who applied initially from these three states have got close centers, while those who have applied later have been allotted to distant centers
 31 march tak pariksha farm kii antim taarikh thi
 Whether the form filled during this time can be differentiated on the basis of first or last

 After reaching Kolkata, you will wait for the train for 8 hours Tirupati which will run on Sunday
 19 agast ko kolkata se ravaanaa hokar 20 agast yani somvaar raat 8 baje pahonchega

 Having taken a ticket for General Bogie, one way fare will be around 1200

 The doldrums of the people of Delhi, the country's capital, are drying up
 sarkaar vikaas or sukh suvidhaon ke tamaam daawey kar rahi he, lekin ek hakeekat yah bhi he ki yahaan ke lakhon logon ko abhi bhi har roj 1 litre pani tak nahin mil paata he
 Delhi is the beat of Hindustan, the city of dreams is Delhi, there are wide streets of bitumen, there is state-of-the-art metro service, there are luxurious markets for everyone; But if there is nothing, then clean water for everyone
 desh kii satta yaheen se chalati he
 Law is made for the country from here, policies for the development of the country are also fixed here, but despite this, the people of Delhi are thirsty
 dilli kii aabaadi kareeb paune do karod ho chuki he, lekin abhi bhi kai lakh logon ko jindagi kii buniyadi suvidha pani nahin mil paata he
 In many areas of Delhi, the water level has reached 150 feet below the ground level
 dakshin dilli ke chhatarpur ilaake main pani jameen se 148
 5 feet down
 dakshin pashchim dilli ke vasant kunj main pani jameen se 132 feet neeche mil rahaa he

 Delhi's truth about water is even more dangerous
 dilli main pani ke 629 aadhikarik strot hai
 Of these, from 2008 to 2012, 304 sources have completely dried up or disappeared
 itnaa hi nahin, dilli pradooshan niyantran cameti ne pani ke 223 namoonon kii jaanch kii jiname se 46 fisadi namoonay hi pine ke laayak paae gaye
 Even today in many urban areas of Delhi black dirty poisonous water comes out of the taps
 majaburi he isi ko pinaa bhi padataa he, isi se nahaana bhi padataa he
 Delhi needs 1025 million gallons of water every day, but gets water only 835 million gallons, that is, there is a shortage in demand and supply of 190 million gallons of water everyday
 aankade gavaahi de rahe hai ki halaat kaabo se baahar hote ja rahe hai
 If in time measures are not taken in Delhi to conserve water and prevent wastage of water, it will not take long for every drop of water in the capital to bleed
