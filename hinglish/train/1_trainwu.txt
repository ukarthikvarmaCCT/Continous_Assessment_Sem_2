 khagolashastriyon kaa kahana he ki kuch chote or bade puchchal taare (dhoomaketu) dharti kii ore berok-tok bade aa rahe hai
 There is a possibility that some of these may hit our earth
 pichley saal time patrika ne yah khabar di thi ki ek puchchal tara yaa chhudra grah teji se prithvi kii disha main aa rahaa he
 It is very powerful and is more destructive than 50 nuclear bombs
 yah prithvi se aagaamee 18 varshon main takaraa saktaa he
 The destruction caused by this cannot be imagined
 time ne bataaya tha ki ukraine ke khagolavidon ne ek vishaal chhudra grah ko prithvi kii ore aate dekha he
 It has been named TV 135 and it is reported that it will hit the earth on August 26, 2032
 is anumaan kii kai deshon ke khagolashatriyon ne pushti kii
 Scientists are not unanimous that the 1,350-foot-tall rock will actually hit the earth that day
 lekin unka andaja he ki isamen 2,500 megaton tianti kii shakti hogi
 In February 2013, a tail star fell in Chelyabinsk, Russia
 vah 19 kilometre kii raftaar se vahaan gira jisase bahut kshati pahunchi
 He shook the windows of thousands of houses and damaged many houses
 us visphot kii takat hiroshima main gire parmaanu bam se 30 guna zyada thi
 Hundreds of people were injured in it while it was a very small piece and its length was just 1,000 meters
 us ghatana ke baad se vaigyanik chaukanne ho gaye hai or unhone isaki khoj tej kar di he
 This could happen in 2080, scientists say, another tail star named 1950 DA is rapidly approaching Earth
 yah is gati se dharti par 16 march, 2080 main giregaa
 It has a diameter of 1,000 meters and it is likely that it will hit the earth at a speed of 38,000 kilometers per hour
 yah itani teji se gum rahaa he ki gurutvkarshan ke niyam bhi dhare rah gaye hai
 It is also being said that it may be broken to pieces before it enters our space
 haalanki kuch vaigyanik maan rahe hai ki ye ghatnaayen sambhav nahin hai or ye puchchal taare dharti se takaraane ke pehle khud hi chur-chur ho jaaenge
 They believe that these stars will be destroyed by the effect of the sun's rays
 lekin kai yah maan rahe hai ki is tarah kii ghatana ho sakati he

 In a tweet, he said, "I am surprised that Smith is returning to prepare for the tour of South Africa
" Surprised to see smith going back home to prepare for SA tour when this one is not finished
 Would any other @cricketaus captain done this? — Mahela Jayawardena (@mahelajay) August 25, 2016I don't understand Steve Smith returning early from ODI series
 The captain should be there to the end! @ Iheals @ bigsportsbrekky # ausvslsurprised to see smith going back home to prepare for SA tour when this one is not finished
 Would any other @cricketaus captain done this? The allegations of Swami Agnivesh's withdrawal of the donation received during the Anna Hazare movement by Arvind Kejriwal have been denied by the Hazare side
 hajaare ke saathiyon ne kaha ki andolan main paardarshita he or ho saktaa he ki agnivesh naaraazgi ke chalate is tarah ke aarope laga rahe hon
 The Hazare side said that the details of income and expenditure will be released by the Public Cause Research Foundation, an organization working as a secretariat for the Jan Lokpal movement, by the end of this month
 hajaare ke saathi manish sitaudiya ke anusaar, hamaari aay or kharch kaa byoraa pehle se website par he
 We have conducted a special audit for the last six months, the details of which will be put on the website by the end of this month
 agnivesh ke bare main unhone kaha, hamaari swami agnivesh se koi ladaai nahin he
 He may have been saying this due to resentment
 bade jo kuch kahen, uskaa palatwaar karnaa hamaari parampara nahin he
 He is a good person and we respect him
 sitaudiya ne kaha ki hamane ralegan siddhi main hui kor samiti kii baithak main maujuud sabhi sadasyon se pisiaref kaa trustee banane ko kaha tha
 During Hazare's fast at Ramlila Maidan, it was announced that donations would be collected in the name of PCRF
 agnivesh kaa aarope he ki kejariwal ne hajaare ke andolan ke dauraan daan main mili 80 lakh rupee se adhik kii dhanrashi ko apane trust main jamaa karke kosh kaa durupyog kiya
 He has said that Anna Hazare's name is not included in Kejriwal's organization PCRF Trust
 patna police ke ek daroga ko ek hotel maalik se muft main hotel ke kamare maangana mahangaa pad gaya
 SSP Manu Maharaj of Patna has moved the line to the accused Daroga
 maamla 30 janvari kaa he
 According to the police, Abhishek Pratap Singh, posted as a sub-inspector at Journalist Nagar police station, went to a hotel in the area and asked the hotel manager for free rooms for some officers of Karnataka Police
 hotel manager ne jab kamare dene se manaa kar diya to gussaye daroga ne hotel maalik ram babu ko phone lagaaya or khubadhamkaaya
 This conversation with the hotel owner was captured in the CCTV camera installed there in the threatening tone of the inspector
 darasal daroga ne hotel maalik ko dhamkaate hue hotel blaclist karwaane kii dhamkee de daali
 Not only this, Daroga, a drunk accused in a khaki uniform, told the hotel owner, if he wants, he should listen to the SP recording the recording of his conversation
 uskaa koi kuch nahin bigaad saktaa he
 After this video of Daroga's threat went viral on social media, Patna DIG and SSP moved the line to the accused Daroga
 hotel maalik kaa kahana he ki aaropee daroga hameshaa vardi kaa durupyog karte hue muft main kamare book karavaaya karata tha
 Being upset by this, the hotel owner had decided that he would never provide the room to the inspector free of cost
 ab se thik ek saal pehle 2 minute 26 second ke video ne puure desh ko chaunkaa diya
 At the Delhi zoo, a white tiger named Vijay killed a man with his jaws inside the enclosure
 lekin sawaal ye uthaa ki makasuud naam ke is shaks kii maut kaa asli jimmedaar koun he? safed baagh, khud makasuud yaa phir chidyaghar prashasan?video: safed baagh ne is tarah daboch lee thi makasuud kii gardashapani sanak ke chalate hi maaraa gaya tha makasuud: centrekendriya praniudyan praadhirakan kii ore se niyukt ek samiti ne buudhvaar ko dilli hoicourt main apni report pesh kii
 The central government blamed the death of Maqsood, a 22-year-old white tiger victim, and said that he did not accept the warning and accidentally fell into the fence
 report main kaha gaya he ki chidyaghar ke karmchaariyon ne maujuud paristhitiyon main apni sarvshereshth koshish kii
 According to the report filed by Central Government lawyer Jasmeet Singh, the committee believes that Maqsood accidentally fell into the enclosure due to his craze towards tigers
 makasuud kii patni kii yachika par report taiyargauratlab he ki yah report mritak kii patni dwaara daayar yachika par saunpi gai
 It claimed that the government should pay compensation for negligence and security lapses
 usne50 lakh rupee kaa muaavjamanga tha
 The report highlighted the security flaws of the zoo, although the zoo administration has not been held responsible for the death of Maqsood in this report presented in the High Court
 lekin duusari ore is report ne chidyaghar kii suraksha khaamiyon ko bhi ujagar kar diya he
 In its report, the committee made to investigate the accident has given several suggestions to make security more effective
 masalan karmchaariyon ko aisi ghatnaon ke liye training or samay samay par mock drill or immergency alarm lagane kipractice kerani chahie
 The court has ordered the filing of the affidavit before 2 December, informing the Center to submit an affidavit before 2 December, informing the formation of a committee for disaster management
 saansad or vidhayak public sarvent hai
 They also get salary allowances from the government treasury
 aise main unka vakaalat karnaa kahaan tak naitik, kanoonee or uchit he, is maamle par baar council of india kii teen sadasyeey cameti somvaar ko apni report degi
 Council chairman Manan Mishra has also hoped that if the three-day deferment given to the committee ends on Friday, the report will come by Monday
 bijepi netaa or supreme court ke vakil ashvini upaadhyaay kii yachika par baar council ne teen sadasyeey samiti banaakar vistrut report maangi thi
 According to Upadhyay's petition, according to the Legislative and Rules of the Bar Council, no person getting salary from anywhere can advocate
 kyonki vakaalat purnakalik pesha he
 In such a situation, when mps and mlas take salary and allowances from the state treasury, then how are they practicing in the court
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki jab tak koi bhi saansad yaa vidhayak jaise pad par he tab tak uski vakil ke rup main practice par pabandi laga deni chahie
 On taking oath, his license should be suspended as long as he is an MP or MLA
 upaadhyaay ne is babat supreme court kaa 1994 main aayaa jajment bhi atech kiya he
 In this, the court said that the doctor practicing private practice will not be considered eligible for advocacy until he resigns from the post of doctor
 aise main sawaal ye uthta he ki jab doctor ek saath do jagah se vetan or bhatte lekar vakaalat nahin kar saktaa to saansad or vidhayak kaise
 The Congress leaders are currently most troubled by the formation of a committee on this petition and the sword hanging on the advocacy practice of mps-mlas
 hoicourt or supreme court main vakaalat karne vaale loksabhaa or rajyasabha saansadon main congress kekapil sibbal, abhishek manu singhvi, pi chidambaram, vivek tankhaa, keties tulsi jaise diggaj shaamil hai
 Big names like Kalyan Banerjee of TMC, Majid Memon of NCP are included
 upie sarkaar ke purv mantri, congress netaa or senior edwocket salmaan khurshid ne to yahaan tak kah diya ki council is maamle main agar saansadon-vidhayakon ke khilaaf kadam uthaaegi to uchit nahin hoga
 Before this, his side should also be heard
 rajasthan se rajyasabha saansad, congress pravaktaa or senior loyr abhishek manu singhvi kaa kahana he ki isse to sansad berozegaar logon se bhar jaaegi
 But the provisions of 48 to 52 in the Bar Council's rules clearly say that salaried people cannot do the same
 lihaaja sabaki nigahen nae saal ke pehle din par tiki hai jab report saunpi jaaegi

 He tweeted one after the other, saying, "just two days before the Surat rally, Delhi Police secured a non-bailable warrant against our Gujarat in-charge Gulab Singh in a fake case
" kya gulab singh ko raily se pehle giraftaar kiya jayega?' Meanwhile, Sidhu also resigned from the Lok Sabha

 dilli main logon ko abhi garmi se raahat milane kii koi ummid dikhaai nahin de rahi he, kyonki mausam vibhaag ke anusaar rajdhani main aamtaur par 29 june tak pahunchane vaala manusan ek hafte kii deree se pahonchega

 The incident of rape of a fourteen-month-old girl in Gujarat has created a new situation
 bacchee jis samaaj kii he uske kuch logon ne ise apane samaaj kii shaan bhar dekha he
 They are collectively uptight
 kah sakate hai ki is samaaj ke bheetar bheed banane ke taiyaar logon ko mauqaa mil gaya he
 That is why Thakor people have considered all those from the social background of the accused involved in the rape
 isamen unki galati nahin he
 In recent times, in order to politicize rape, a religious background was raised so that its pretexts would break up on a community
 aaropee musalmaan he to hangaamaa lekin aaropee hindu he or peedit dalit to chuppi
 The occasion of religious mobilization is being created on the pretext of cruelty to the victim
 yahi kaam jati ke str par bhi ho rahaa he
 However, all the parties of Gujarat have condemned the incident
 thakor samaaj ke netaa alpesh thakor ne bhi ninda kii he or apil kii he
 The government there has also condemned the incident of exorcising the people of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh
 gujarat police is maamle main sakriy he
 More than 300 people arrested for bullying have been arrested
 thakor samaaj ke logon ne bhaajapa kaa virodh kiya tha
 If the rape case had taken a religious color, we would have seen what the Gujarat Police would have done
 kuch nahin karti
 Still, the police takes strict action in this matter
 cheef secetry or police pramukh ne sakriyata dikhaai he
 Therefore, there is a need to explain the society on both sides in this matter
 kaanoon kaa bharosa dene ke liye or balaatkaar ke kilaaf samaaj ko jaagruk banane ke liye kaam karnaa hoga
 Amidst all this, the pain of those who have had to leave the buses of Ahmedabad on an unbearable journey of thirty hours, shame the whole country
 yah kitna dukhad he
 The people of UP Bihar have supported this country by giving them cheap and good labor
 har baat par unhen haank dena thik nahin he
 From Gujarat, in 2014, these people were sent to the villages of UP Bihar by filling them in buses so that they can promote Narendra Modi
 gujarat model kaa jhootha sapana baant saken
 What would a worker do under compulsion chalaa gaya or prachaar kaa kaam kar aayaa
 Incidents of assault have been reported with these people in the cities and countryside of Gujarat
 makaan maalikon ne dhamkaaya he ki rajya chhod do
 Such intolerance is not good
 gujarat banaam upi bihar nahin hona chahie
 The leaders have divided you
 ab aap uske liye maatr maance kii boti rah gaye hai
 Seeing the appearance of big leaders, people are trying this formula to become leaders even at small levels
 aise logon ko gujarat main or bihar main kahin bhi panpane na den
 We are looking for one another all the time
 pehle dharm ke aadhaar par ek anya tay karte hai phir jati ke naam par phir bhashaa ke naam par
 It is not that up-bihar is not crowded
 bihar ke supaul main gundon ne apane maa baap or rishtedaar ke saath milakar ladakiyon ke hostel par hamalaa kar diya
 35 girls are injured
 in ladakiyon ne rozaana kii chhedhkhani kaa virodh kiya tha
 The entire society broke down on girls between twelve and sixteen years old
 bihar ke mujaffarpur main ek balika grih main qareeb chalis ladakiyon kaa shoshan hua, vahaan ke samaaj main koi halchal nahin hui
 That society now only comes to run with a sword in the days of Ramnavami and Moharram
 baaqi jo nahin daud rahe hai wo ghar baithkar sahi tehraane ke kaaran khoj kar mast hai
 In Bihar and UP, on a religious basis, the crowd that is roaming like crazy is not new
 bas nayaa yah he ki pehle se zyaada sangathit he
 Its schedules are fixed according to festivals and animals
 bheed ke dushman tay hai or is bheed ke kaarykram se kise laabh hoga vah bhi
 There is a factory to create a crowd on social media
 yah bheed hamen asurakshit kar rahi he
 We are giving ourselves to this mob and in the name of the crowd, they have started creating goons in society and government
 beshak aakrosh kii baat he lekin sajaa kaise mili, system kaise kaam kare is par fokas hona chahie
 Those who were involved should not be soft with them, but why should the rest be treated as innocent
 yah maansikta kahaan se aati he? isaki training sampradayik raajnneeti se milti he
 We are becoming fragmented
 golbandi ke liye hinsa ekmaatr maqasad rah gai he
 If someone wants to kill, a crowd of crazy people accumulates
 baaqi kisi kaam ke liye chaar log nahin milte
 The comments note: bahuton ko yah lekh aasaani se samaj nahin aayega

 haalanki gujarat ke sabhi dalon ne is ghatana kii ninda kii he
 Alpesh Thakor, leader of Thakor society, has also condemned and appealed
 vahaan kii sarkaar ne bhi uttar pradesh, bihar or madhya pradesh ke logon ko bhagane kii ghatana kii bhi ninda kii he
 Gujarat Police is active in this case
 dhamkaane vaale 300 se adhik logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 The people of Thakor society opposed the BJP
 agar balaatkaar kaa maamla dharmik rang le letaa tab dekhte ki gujarat police kya karti
 Does not do anything
 phir bhi is maamle main police ne sakhti barti he
 The Chief Secretary and the Chief of Police have shown activism
 isliye is maamle main donon taraf ke samaaj ko samajhane kii zarurat he
 Work has to be done to give confidence to the law and to make the society aware against rape
 in sabake bich jin logon ko ahmedabad kii bason main ladaa kar tees tees ghante kii asahneeya yatra par nikalnaa padaa he, unki yah pidaa puure desh ko sharmasaar kare
 How sad it is
 upi bihar ke logon ne is mulk ko sasta or umdaa shram dekar sanvaara he
 It is not right to make them laugh at everything
 isi gujarat se 2014 main bason main bharkar ye log upi bihar ke gaanvon main bheje gaye the taaki ve narendra modi kaa prachaar kar saken
 To share the false dream of Gujarat model
 majaburi main mazdoor kya karata
 Gone and came preaching
 in logon ke saath gujarat ke shaharon or dehaton main marpet kii ghatana saamne ai he
 Landlords have threatened to leave the state
 itani asahansheeltaa thik nahin he
 There should not be Gujarat vs UP Bihar
 netaaon ne aapako baant diya he
 Now you are just a piece of meat for him
 bade netaaon kii shakl dekhakar chote str par bhi netaa banane ke liye log yahi farmula aazamaa rahe hai
 Do not let such people flourish anywhere in Gujarat and Bihar
 ham har samay ek anya kii talash main hai
 First they decide on the basis of religion, then in the name of caste and then in the name of language
 aisa nahin he ki upi-bihar main bheed nahin he
 In Supaul, Bihar, the goons along with their parents and relatives attacked the girls hostels
 35 ladkiyaan ghayal hai
 These girls had opposed the daily molestation
 baarah se solah saal kii ladakiyon par puraa samaaj tut padaa
 Nearly forty girls were exploited in a girl child in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, there was no movement in the society there
 us samaaj ko ab sirf ramanavami or moharram ke dinon main talwaar lekar daudane aata he
 The rest who are not running, are happy to find the reason to justify sitting at home
 bihar or upi main pichley dinon dharmik aadhaar par jo bheed banakar paaglon kii tarah gum rahi he wo nai nahin he
 Just new is that it is more organized than before
 tyoharon or jaanwaron ke hisaab se uske kaarykram tay hai
 The enemies of the crowd are determined and who will benefit from this mob program
 soshal media par bheed banane kii factry he
 This crowd is making us insecure
 ham khud ko is bheed ke hawaale kar rahe hai or bheed ke naam par samaaj or sarkaar main gunde paidaa karne lage hai
 Of course it is a matter of resentment but there should be a focus on how to get punishment, how the system should work
 jo log shaamil the unke saath narmi na ho magar baaqiyon ko qasuurvaar kyon samajha jaae
 Where does this mentality come from? Its training comes from communal politics
 ham khandit hote ja rahe hai
 Violence has remained the sole objective of mobilization
 kisi ko maarna ho to paaglon kii bheed jamaa ho jaati he
 Four people are not available for any other work

 Now you are just a piece of meat for him
 bade netaaon kii shakl dekhakar chote str par bhi netaa banane ke liye log yahi farmula aazamaa rahe hai
 Do not let such people flourish anywhere in Gujarat and Bihar
 ham har samay ek anya kii talash main hai
 First they decide on the basis of religion, then in the name of caste and then in the name of language
 aisa nahin he ki upi-bihar main bheed nahin he
 In Supaul, Bihar, the goons along with their parents and relatives attacked the girls hostels
 35 ladkiyaan ghayal hai
 These girls had opposed the daily molestation
 baarah se solah saal kii ladakiyon par puraa samaaj tut padaa
 Nearly forty girls were exploited in a girl child in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, there was no movement in the society there
 us samaaj ko ab sirf ramanavami or moharram ke dinon main talwaar lekar daudane aata he
 The rest who are not running, are happy to find the reason to justify sitting at home
 bihar or upi main pichley dinon dharmik aadhaar par jo bheed banakar paaglon kii tarah gum rahi he wo nai nahin he
 Just new is that it is more organized than before
 tyoharon or jaanwaron ke hisaab se uske kaarykram tay hai
 The enemies of the crowd are determined and who will benefit from this mob program and also
 soshal media par bheed banane kii factry he
 This crowd is making us insecure
 ham khud ko is bheed ke hawaale kar rahe hai or bheed ke naam par samaaj or sarkaar main gunde paidaa karne lage hai
 Of course it is a matter of resentment but there should be a focus on how to get punishment, how the system should work
 jo log shaamil the unke saath narmi na ho magar baaqiyon ko qasuurvaar kyon samajha jaae
 Where does this mentality come from? Its training comes from communal politics
 ham khandit hote ja rahe hai
 Violence has remained the sole objective of mobilization
 kisi ko maarna ho to paaglon kii bheed jamaa ho jaati he
 Four people are not available for any other work

 It is not that up-bihar is not crowded
 bihar ke supaul main gundon ne apane maa baap or rishtedaar ke saath milakar ladakiyon ke hostel par hamalaa kar diya
 35 girls are injured
 in ladakiyon ne rozaana kii chhedhkhani kaa virodh kiya tha
 The entire society broke down on girls between twelve and sixteen years old
 bihar ke mujaffarpur main ek balika grih main qareeb chalis ladakiyon kaa shoshan hua, vahaan ke samaaj main koi halchal nahin hui
 That society now only comes to run with a sword in the days of Ramnavami and Moharram
 baaqi jo nahin daud rahe hai wo ghar baithkar sahi tehraane ke kaaran khoj kar mast hai
 In Bihar and UP, on a religious basis, the crowd that is roaming like crazy is not new
 bas nayaa yah he ki pehle se zyaada sangathit he
 Its schedules are fixed according to festivals and animals
 bheed ke dushman tay hai or is bheed ke kaarykram se kise laabh hoga vah bhi
 There is a factory to create a crowd on social media
 yah bheed hamen asurakshit kar rahi he
 We are giving ourselves to this mob and in the name of the crowd, they have started creating goons in society and government
 beshak aakrosh kii baat he lekin sajaa kaise mili, system kaise kaam kare is par fokas hona chahie
 Those who were involved should not be soft with them, but why should the rest be treated as innocent
 yah maansikta kahaan se aati he? isaki training sampradayik raajnneeti se milti he

 kendriya grih mantri pi
 Chidambaram has said that India has nothing to do with Balochistan and wondered why India would do so when it had many problems along the border with Pakistan
 chidambaram ne yah spasht kar diya ki congress bharat-pakistan sanyukt vaktavy ke mudde par sarkaar ke saath rahegi jab agle saptaah sansad main pradhanmantri manmohan singh is bare main apni baat rakhenge
 He said that Singh will explain the 'true meaning' of the document in Parliament and will give details of how Balochistan was mentioned in it
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ham baluchistan main shaamil nahin hai
 We have nothing to do with Pakistan's internal problem
 asal main, balooch netaa ne kaha he ki unhen bharat se koi samarthan nahin mila he
 Chidambaram said, "besides, why would we join Balochistan
 pakistan ke saath satee hamaari pashchimi seemaa par kai samasyaayein hai
 "the government can defend the statement," Chidambaram said, "I am confident that it will be brought into the discussion as to what circumstances led to the mention of Balochistan in the statement
" ’’ sanyukt vaktavy ke sambandh main congress main alag-alag mat hone kii repoton ke bare main kendriya grih mantri ne kaha, ‘‘party ne kaha he ki sarkaar vaktavy kaa bachaav kar sakati he or karegi
 i have heard this
 is bare main sansad main charchaa hogi or jab charchaa hogi to aap paayenge ki party sarkaar ke saath he
 When Chidambaram was asked about Foreign Secretary Shivshankar Menon's statement that it could be a case of a poorly prepared blueprint of the india-pakistan joint statement, he said, "let us now understand the true meaning of the statement
" Have to see
 ’’ unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri ne pehle hi yah kaha he ki sahi myne ye hai ki jab tak pakistan aatankwaad ke khilaaf karrwai nahin karata, tab tak vaarta shuru nahin ho sakati
 The results of Rajasthan assembly elections have given the mandate of change of power once again
 rajya main vasundhara sarkaar kaa ant hua or ashok gahalot kii mukhyamantri ke rup main ek baar phir vaapasi hui he
 Often, when power changes take place, some welfare schemes launched by the previous government are either discontinued or they are renamed and launched into a new club after some minor reforms
 lihaaja rajasthan main bhi yah sawaal uthanaa laazmi he ki vasundhara sarkaar dwaara shuru kii gai yojanaon kaa ab kya hoga or satta parivartan se janata ne kya khoyaa kya paaya?haalanki chunaav prachaar ke dauraan purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne kaha tha ki agar ve satta main aae to pichhali sarkaar kii acchhee yojanaon ko jari rakhenge
 Actually, these questions are also arising because the Vasundhara government had reviewed the social pension scheme, free medicine, free health check up and other schemes being run during the tenure of the previous Gehlot government and implemented some new schemes, including health Apart from Bhamashah Health Insurance Scheme, Bhamashah Card in the area, POS machines at ration shops in public distribution system Went to the applicable requirements
 prachaar ke dauraan pradesh congress adhyaksh ne kaha tha ki bhamashah yojana ke antargat kai khamiyaan najar ai hai or yadi congress kii sarkaar aati he to isaki samiksha kii jaaegi
 The Congress, in its manifesto, promised free medicine and treatment, with the assurance of legal recognition of the right to health
 iske alaava rashan kii dukaanon par pioes mashiinon kii anivaaryta bhi samaapt kii ja sakati he, kyonki ise lekar saamaajik sanghathan kaaphi virodh kar chuke hai
 The Congress in its manifesto made the biggest promise of debt waiver for farmers
 madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh kii navnirvaachit sarkaar ne shapath grahan ke chand ghanton baad hi karjamaafee kii filon par dastakhat kar die hai
 However, it has not yet been announced in Rajasthan as the figures for partial waiver by the Vasundhara government are yet to be reviewed
 iske alaava congress ne apane ghoshnaptr main shikshit berozegaron ko 3500 rupee berogari bhatta dene kaa vaayada kiya tha
 Whereas BJP promised 30,000 government jobs and 50 lakh jobs in private sector every year along with giving unemployment allowance of Rs 5000
 jabaki congress ne swarozgaar ko badhaava dene ke liye sasti daron par lone kaa vaayada kiya tha
 In view of the crisis of tender workers in the state, the Congress promised that the tenderers of National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) departments will be regularized
 gauratlab he ki in swasthya karmiyon ne piem modi kii march ke maheene main jhunjhunu kii raily main kaale jhande dikhaa kar pradarshan kiya tha
 On the other hand, BJP had promised to give priority to the tender workers on the basis of bonus points in the job
 panchayat raaj kii baat karen to panchayat chunaavon main nunatam shaikshanik yogyata ke liye raaje sarkaar dwaara laae gaye niyam ko khatm karne kaa vaayada congress ne apane ghoshnaa patr main kiya tha
 Significantly, the BJP government had enacted a law and made rules that the minimum educational qualification of the candidate of Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti should be up to 10th and the Sarpanch candidate should be at least 7th pass
 shiksha ke kshetra main baat kii jaae to congress ne ladakiyon kii puri shiksha muft karne kaa vaayada kiya lekin yah dekhne vaali baat hogi ki kya yah vaayada nijee skulon par bhi lagu hoga
 The Congress has also promised to reopen 2 xxrep 4 0 schools that were closed during the BJP government and to re-start Ambedkar Law University and Haridev Joshi Journalism University
 kul milakar dekha jaae sarkaar badalane par bade paimaane par nitigat parivartan dekhne ko nahin milenge
 But farmers' debt waiver will be a relief news
 to vahiin agar gahalot sarkaar nivida karmiyon ko niyamit kar pai to yah badi uplabdhi hogi
 In the health sector, Gehlot's free medicine scheme was highly appreciated, which was extended by the Vasundhara Raje government as a Bhamashah card, but with his picture, this card also became a medium of publicity

 Nomination papers for this election will be filled between November 19 and November 26 for the mid-term election to be held in Sri Lanka on January 5

 But Pawar was not happy to see him
 kai logon kii najaron mempwar satta or dhanke bich madhur sambandh ke paryaay ban gaye hai
 In recent times, no leader has faced as much criticism as Pawar has faced

 This veteran Maratha has been struggling almost every week over controversies over his or her family's alleged investment in various projects
 kuch taaja rahasyodghatan ye hai-figh sharad pavaar ke bhattije ajit pavaar ek ghotaale main funs gaye hai
 Ajit was the irrigation minister of Maharashtra in 2007
 dastavejon se pataa chalaa he ki unhone apane aanshik swaamitv vaali company agi marcentile ko raigarh main ek baandh kii marammat kaa theka de diya tha
 In lieu of this repair, 93,646 square feet of land was leased for 99 years instead of paying money to the company
 puraane mumbaipune rajmarg par di gai yah jameen ek khubasurat jalashay ke paas sthit he
 In 2008, the company got an additional 97,000 square feet of land to build a road and a bridge
 ajit ne pehle is baat se inkaar kar diya tha ki agi marcentile se unka koi lenadena he
 But when he showed the document that it was clear that he had 8,800 equity shares of this company, he had no answer
 pavaar ke paariwarik dost or 2ji ghotaale main shaamil dibi realty ke sahamaalik vinod goyanka is company ke nideshkon main shaamil hai
 Ajit said that he had sold his shares in November 2005, so he did not mention them in his election affidavit
 lekin record se jaahir he ki 2005 ke baad bhi company main unka hissaa bana hua tha
 On July 14, 2007, Pawar, Ajit, Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and some bureaucrats met in a guest house in Lavasa to manipulate the rules of the Lavasa Corporation
 is company main pavaar kii beti supriya or unke pati sadanand sule kaa hissaa tha (jise baad main bech diya gaya)
 The developer of the city of Lavasa has been given the status of Town Planner, which is usually reserved for the municipal corporations
 figh dastavejon se jaahir he ki pavaar ne '80 ke dashak main rajya ke mukhyamantri kii haisiyat se kis tarah apane ek dost kii company ko 3
 Helped to spread 27 acres of land to 326 acres (see details in the box and Pawar's statement)
 figh pune nagarpalika ayukta mahesh jagade ne aarope lagaaya he ki yarvada main dibi realty kii paanch sitara hotel pariyojna main niyamon keulanghan par uske pramukh vinod goyanka ko demolision order dene par kendriya mantri pavaar ne unka tabadalaa karvaa diya
 The project was being built on the land of Mukund Bhavan Trust
 us pariyojna main sule kaa bhi hissaa tha
 Jagade told India Today by telephone from the IAS Academy in Mussoorie, "the leaders (read Pawar) forced me out and forced me to undergo training
" main yah prashikshan is saal aktubar main le saktaa tha
 "upon the departure of the municipal commissioner, his responsibilities are usually given to the Additional Commissioner, but in Pune, these were handed over to the Divisional Commissioner Dilip Bund
 upie sarkaar ke aprihaary stambhon main se ek, pavaar kii yah ajeeb khubi he ki ve jis cheez main haath lagaate hai usamen agar ghotaalaa na saamne aae, to vah vivaadaaspad jarur ho jaati he
 Eknath Khadse of BJP, Leader of Opposition in Maharashtra, told India Today, "it is not right for Pawar's leader to become a matter of discussion in the state assembly for a scam every week
" unhen or unkepariwaar ke sadasyon ko apana daaman saaf dikhaanaa hoga, anyathaa ye aarope bane rahenge
 "RTI activist Ravindra Barhate agrees with this," Pawar initially said that he has nothing to do with Lavasa but just look at where he (as Agriculture Minister) is meeting and giving facilities to the builders
 
 '' barhate ne kai aise dastavej hasil kiye hai jinase unhen pavaar or unke parivaar par nishaanaa saadhane main madad mili he
 Pawar's daughter, MP Supriya Sule has been surrounded by questions over her relationship with DB Realty
 supriya or unke pati ke paas panchasheel tech park van (pitipio) main sanyukt rup se 9 fisadi hissaa he
 PTPO and DB Realty are joint custodians of Mukund Bhavan Trust (MBT) of Yerwada, Pune
 pavaar ke ''paariwarik mitra'' atul chordia pitipio ke maalik hai
 The company is located near a five-star hotel being built by DB Realty on survey number 191A in Yerwada
 pavaar ke virdohi june, 2007 main shahid balvaaki ore kendriya paryaavaran evam van mantralay ko bheje us patr se dang hai jisamen balava ne apane hotel or ity park ke liye paryaavaran sambandhi manjuuri die jane kii maang kii he
 He was succeeded by his friend, the then Environment Minister A
 raja kii badaulat ek hi din main manjuuri mil gai
 Khadse argues that Balwa's letter reveals his association with the PTPO, in which Sule is a partner
 ve poochhate hai, ''agar balava kaa pitipio ke saath koi sambandh nahin tha to unhone pitipio kii ore se apane letterhed par patr kyon bheja
 "NCP MLA and confidant of Pawar family, Jitendra Awhad, rejects this argument
" awad kaa kahana he, ''pitipio ke liye 2004 main jameen kharidi gai or 2006 main vah banakar taiyaar ho gaya
 Balwa bought land for a five-star hotel in 2007
 aise main pitipio ke liye unki manjuuri maangane kaa sawaal kahaan se uthta he? balava ke aavedanpatr main panchasheel shabd nahin likhaa he
 They are also building an IT park in the same area
 '' lekin unke paas iskaa koijawab nahin he ki balava ne ity park ke liye paryaavaran sambandhi manjuuri kab maangi thi
 India Today visited the area and found no evidence of construction of any IT park there
 barhate ne soochna ke adhikaar kanoon (artiai) ke tahat pune se dastavej hasil kiye, jinamein dibi realty ke saath sule ke kaarobaar ke saboot hai
 Panchsheel Tech Park registered the Articles of Association relating to PTPO on 22 June 2005 with the Registrar of Companies
 is dastavej main panchasheel tech park ne kaha he ki uske paas yaravada main survey number 191e main 92,588 varg foot jameen he
 Actually, it had only 52,000 sqft built-up space till that day; The remaining land — 40,000 sq
ft
 — was DB Realty
 barhate kaa kahana he, ''agar panchasheel dibi realty kii jameen ko apana dikhaati he, to unke bich kaarobaari sambandh hai
 He says that where the PTPO is located and DB Realty's hotel is being built, it was originally Army land
 ''record se jaahir hota he ki vahajameen 1931 se hi sena ke kabje main thi
 It should be investigated how the defense land was transferred to MBT and then how MBT sold it to DB Realty and Panchsheel
 '' barhate apane daawey ko sabit karne ke liye percy billymoriya kaa udhaaharan dete hai
 Bilimoria claimed that his ancestors had purchased the land of survey number 191B in 1937
 rajasav vibhaag ne vah jameen billymoriya ke hawaale kar di
 But the Tehsildar rejected the deal only after four months
 tehseeldaar kaa kahana tha ki vah jameen sena kii he
 "it says that survey number 191 is the land of the army
" kya sarkaar vah jameen embiti se usee tarah waapas legi jis tarah billymoriya se lee gai thi?''dibi realty ke saath sule kaa sambandh keval pitipio ke kaaran hi ujagar nahin hota
 DB Realty is constructing a 10-storey building for Pawar Public School in Chandivali, Mumbai
 is trust kii pramukh sule hai
 The funny thing is that DB Realty is building a residential colony for slum dwellers a few meters away from that school
 mumbai ke ek mantri kii maane to dibi realty us skool ke nirmaan ke liye paisa nahin le rahi he
 In return, Pawar's NCP is trying to get DB Realty to redevelop a 42,000 square meter pasari colony in Worli, Mumbai's expensive area
 varli kaa bhukhand apane baari bazaar mulya kii vajah se behad mahatvapurn he
 The redevelopment of Worli's biggest slum hatter after Dharavi in mumbai was awarded to Lokhandwala Builders, arch rival of DB Realty, but the company challenged it on 24 August 2010 in the Bombay High Court
 haalanki pavaar yah kehete hai ki ve balava or goyanka se parichit bhar hai par india today ke paas maujuud dastavejon ke mutabik pavaar, unki patni or supriya sule ke purna swaamitv vaali company ne 2004 main dynamiks hotels group ko kamasekam 25 lakh ru
 lamps
 haalanki yah paisa pavaar parivaar kii company lap finance and investmentcompany ke liye jameen kharidne kii khatir agrim raashi ke rup main diya gaya, par koi sarkari file nahin he jisase sabit ho ki dynamiks ne unke liye jameen kharidi
 The Dynamics Hotel documents also do not reveal what was done with that money
 dynamiks hotels ko baad main vize realty hnivet limited naam de diya gaya, jo balavagoyanka samrajya kii pramukh company ban gai
 Pawar likes the land the most
 aaj vahi unki siyaasi pareshaani kii vajah ban gai he
 Shortly after the NCP supremo resigned from the Group of Ministers (gom) on corruption, he asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to expel him from all 26 goms
 lekin pradhanmantri unhen mukt karne ke liye taiyaar nahin the
 Seeing the controversy growing around him, Pawar called a few select journalists to his house and made a very emotional request to him: "strike me, but leave Supriya
" ''agle saptaah televijan channelon ne ajit or agi marcentile ke bich sambandhon ko oochaalnaa shuru kar diya, jisase upmukhyamantri ajit kaaphi asahaj hoge
 Pawar's friends, including some corporate people, advised him to enlist the help of a public relations agency
 unke mantralay kii sabsidiari ne mutual piaar par dhyaan bhi diya
 Chandra Iyengar, one of his favorite bureaucrats in Maharashtra, told India Today, "he was very upset, it seemed that nothing would work in his favor
" lekin unhen in tanaavon se nibatna aata he
 Pawar has been embroiled in controversies for a decade and a half
 baraamati main unke vidya pratishthan par aparaadh jagat se jude logon se daan lene kaa aarope laga or unke baraamati sahakaari doodh sangh par kisaanon ko unka jaij bakaayaa na chukaane kaa aarope laga
 The Union minister and his family were dragged to court for taking an unbeatable lead in acquiring land in and around Pune
 pavaar par gharelu bazaar main gen kii banaavati killat paidaa karne kaa aarope laga
 The scandal erupted in 2007, and last year it was accused of importing and exporting sugar, allegedly to help traders
 pavaar parivaar kaa city korporavshan naamak company main hissaa tha jisane pune varirs ke liye ipiel main vivaadaaspad boli lagaai thi
 These controversies have eroded Pawar's image as one of the most influential leaders in the country for some time
 apane chaar dashak ke kariyar main 71 varshiya pavaar ne centre main kai mahatvapurn mantralayon kii jimmedaari sanbhali he lekin aaj unhen apni chhavi sudhaarney kii sakht jarurat he
 Maharashtra Public Works Minister Chhagan Bhujbal says, "the man who made his second career as a deal-giver still has high ambitions
" ab unhen apana daaman saaf kar lenaa chahie
 "but Pawar still retains power
" loksabhaa main bhaajapa ke upanetaa gopinath munde kaa kahana he, ''shaq hota he ki ve apni vah buland chhavi phir kaise hasil karenge jo kai saal pehle thi-aise vyakti kii, jo krishi main kranti laa saktaa tha, aisa vyakti jo pradhanmantri ban saktaa tha
 Many people have stopped respecting him
 istathy ke saamne yah baat gaun he ki un par abhiyog lagegaa yaa nahin
 Munde once proposed in the Lok Sabha to present evidence that Pawar had boarded the Sharma brothers (anil Amar Singh Sharma and Anil Nirbhay Singh Sharma), alleged sharpshooters of Dawood Ibrahim, in his government plane
 sharma bandhu sansanikhej jeje hospital golibari main shaamil the
 But Chatur Pawar saved his skin by saying that not a single case was registered against him when the Sharma brothers traveled with him
 aise hai pavaar
 Bajwud remains his political importance in getting involved in controversies
 unhone india today ko bataaya, ''main vivaadon kaa aadi ho chukaa hum
 i have completed 43 years in parliamentary and assembly politics
 kai varshon tak raajnneeti main bane rahane vaale vyakti par kisi nakisi varg se hamalaa hona tay he
 It does not affect me because i only know the truth ”(see conversation)
 aaj ve apni chhavi bachaane ke liye majaboor ho gaye hai
 When the Pawar saga began decades ago, he used to be a star - a brilliant administrator and secular hero
 unhone hi marathavada vishvavidhyalay kaa naam badalakar dow
 Babasaheb Ambedkar went though he knew that it would have to pay a political price; He revived the stock market in two days after the 1993 Mumbai blasts; He changed the face of agriculture by linking the State Employment Guarantee Scheme with horticulture
 aise samay main jab upie bhrashtachar ke mudde par bachaav kii mudra apnaane ko majaboor he, tab pavaar ke chintit hone kii vajah vaazib he
 Although it seems beneficial for the Congress president to keep Pawar unbalanced, she does not want to uproot him completely
 party rakanpa ke saath gathbandhan banaae rakhana chaahegi, duusari ore unke kathith sambandhon kii jaankaree li karke, krishi mantri ke rup main unke pradarshan par sawaal karke or ek aalochak ke rup main maharashtra ke mukhyamantri-prithviraj chavaan-kii niyukti karke un par dabaav banaae rakhegi
 Congress insiders say that Pawar has been deliberately pressured recently
 jis tarah se sibiai ne ek patrkaar ke saath nira radia kii baatcheet li kii, jisamen radia ne kaha ki pavaar dibi ke maalik hai, usase sanket mil gaya ki hukmran is paksh ko ujagar karnaa chaahate hai
 This was the latest in revelations that tarnished Pawar's image - from the wheat import scam to UPA 1 to Balwa
 pavaar ke kareebi logon kaa kahana he ki kaarobaar jagat ke saath unka sidhaa sambandh tab badha jab unki beti supriya kii shaadi mahindra and mahindra ke prabandh nideshak bhalchandra sule ke bete sadanand sule se 'i
 Sadanand, a director in Vijay Mallya's company United Beverages, also had a share in Lavasa
 lekin pichley kuch saal se pavaar ko maaloom tha ki bade vyavsaayee kis tarah se moti kamai kar rahe hai
 He consistently advocated opening up the market and allowing the import of commodities
 unka sambandh jinson kaa vinimay karne vaale exange emsiex se bataaya gaya, jise mumbai sthit vyavsaayee jignesh shah chalaate hai
 Pawar is in the Ministry of Agriculture at a time when genetically modified (GM) crops like cotton are being grown extensively in the country
 bharat gairkhadyann fasalon ke maamle main duniya ke paanch bade bazaaron main shaamil he
 In the Code, they are laying the foundation of the country's biggest business - food production and land
 maharashtra ke prashaskeey mukhyalay, mantralay main jameen ke liye pavaar kii bhukh ke kisse sunaae jate hai
 In 1993, when Pawar was the chief minister, a prominent Marathi producer invited him to watch his new film
 pavaar ne ek khaas gane ko teen baar chalavaaya
 The producer and others asked the Chief Minister if he liked the song
 teesri baar sunne ke baad pavaar ne nirmaataa se poocha ki us gane ko kahaan filmaaya gaya he
 The producer said, "mumbai
 '' pavaar kaa jawaab thah ''mujhe kaaphi khuli jagah dikhaai de rahi he
 Why don't i know about such a vacant place in Mumbai? ”pawar would know
 unke aalochakon kaa kahana he ki yah diggaj netaa kisi party kaaryakarta main rajnatik sambhaavna ke mukaable kisibhukhand kii sambhaavna ko behatar tareeke se samaj saktaa he
 He had personally selected land for several residential projects of DB Realty, including the controversial hill station Lavasa and Aldiadigova in Bambolim, Goa
 tab unhen abhas nahin tha ki jindagi kaa sabase bada shauk unki jindagi kaa sabase bada abhishaap ban jayega

 or teesri unnav ke dabang vidhayak kii khabar jo balaatkaar kaa ilzaam sir par liye puure lakhanu kaa chakkar lagaataa he or sarkaar uske saamne natmastak najar aati he
 Today's politics need fasting in the face of havoc on the government
 upwas hoga to pet khaali hoga
 Speech on an empty stomach rarely comes out
 hamaare netaa hoshithar hai or sarkaar dedh hoshiyaar
 That is why everyone has gone on a silent fast under the pretext of fasting
 koi bol hi nahin rahaa ki kathua kii aath saal kii bacchee haivaanon ke havas kaa shikaar hui he or haivaan kaa koi dharm bia zaat nahin hoti
 Therefore, see this humanity not through the prism of religion but only and only through the prism of law
 upwas ke naam par maun vrath he isliye netaa or sarkaar ye bhi nahin bol rahe he ki balaatkaar ke ilzaam main ghire unnav ke vidhayak ke saath kya suluk hona chahie
 Revealed in the charge sheet - The girl being in the temple is not surprised by the rape, on the thinking of people who find religion and religion in a crime like gang rape by sacking Rooh
 log kehete hai ki us bacchee ke balaatkaariyon ko chhod do, jinhone kathua ke ek mandir main apni havas mitaai thi
 Say your hand on your heart
 aise logon ko dharm ke naam par chhod bhi den to kuya iske apane hi dharm ke log yaa iske apane kareebi-rishtedaar apane hi ghar kii kisi bacchee ko inke saath akelaa chhodane kii himmat karenge? isse pehle ki aap jawaab den zaruri he ki us bacchee kii kahani ek baar zarur sun lijie
 And this story is not just a story but a part of the charge sheet filed in the district court of Kathua
 yani ye kanoonee dastauez he
 In the recent past, some families of the minority Bakarwal community had settled around the village Rasna of Kathua, the dreaded conspiracy of the temple servitor Sanjiram
 isi gaanv ke devisthan mandir kaa sevadaar sanji ram is samudaay ke logon ko gaanv se hataanaa chahta tha
 He created this whole conspiracy
 rajasav adhikari ke pad se ritair sanji ram pados kii 8 saal kii ek bacchee ko roj pashuon ko charaane ke liye jangal jate hue dekhtaa tha
 After this, he woke up with a sin on his mind
 us haivaan ne apane naaballig bhattije ko bhi is paap main shaamil kar liya
 It was a matter of 10 January 2018 that the girl was beaten up, raped, and intoxicated
 bhatija jaanwaron ko khoj rahi bacchee par jangal main tut padataa he
 Takes him to a temple in the forest
 court main daakhil chargeshit ke mutabik mandir ke prarthana kaksh main hi wo bacchee se rape karata he
 Then he also calls his friend Mannu
 donon phir se rape karte hai
 He then informs his uncle about it
 sanji ram behoshee kii dawa mangavata he or mandir pahunchataa he
 Both the girls were beaten, raped, beaten, raped and then raped
 kai baar behoshee kii haalat main bhi wo rape karte rahe
 a friend called from Meerut for raping, the girl's father reaches the Hiranagar police station on January 12 that our daughter did not come home for three days
 vishesh police adhikari deepak khajuriya ko jaanch main lagaaya jaataa he
 The team along with him included ASI Pravesh Kumar, Surinder Kumar and Head Constable Tilak Raj
 is bich sanji kaa bhatija meerut ke apane dost vishaal jangotra ko phone karke kahata he ki agar wo aath saal kii bacchee kaa rape karnaa chahta he, to fouran kathua aa jaae
 According to the chargesheet, Vishal reaches Kathua from the next train and rapes the unconscious girl
 pulisavaale bhi bane haivaan, hatya se pehle adhikari ne kiya repchargeshit ke mutabik tab tak jaanch adhikari deepak khajuriya ladki kaa pataa lagaate hue mandir pahunch jaataa he
 But instead of immediately arresting everyone, he starts blackmailing the nephew's family
 chargeshit main likhaa he ki wo ladke ko bachaane ke evaj main dedh lakh rupye bhi vasuul karata he
 After this, when he reaches the temple, the girl is lying unconscious
 sanjiram kahata he ki ab isaki hatya kerani hogi
 On this, the investigating officer Khajuria says that stay for a while
 main bhi kuch kar luun
 After that the police officer also rapes the girl
 uske baad sabhi phir se baari-baari aath saal kii us maasoom ke saath samuhik balaatkaar karte hai
 Strangulation was killed, crushed with stone, and then in the same condition strangled the girl and killed her
 phir uske sir ko pathar se kuchlaa jaataa he
 And the corpse is thrown into the forest
 maasoom ke saath itani darindagi ki kisi kaa dil bhi dahal jaae
 As per the chargesheet, Sanji Ram, his son Vishal, sub-inspector Anand Dutta, two special police officers Deepak Khajuria and Surendra Verma, head constable Tilak Raj and local resident Pravesh Kumar have been booked for rape, murder and eradication of evidence
 kya insaan hone ke naam par ham sharminda nahinyah he kathua kii puri kahani
 Now you answer kya soch rahe hai
 Mind heavy? Is reasonable lekin ham isi duniya main rahete hai
 We are proud of our civilization
 ham kehete nahin thakte ki duniya ko tahazeeb kaa shaur hamane sikhaaya or ab ham kahaan pahunch gaye? insaaf ho bhi jaae to kya he? is kahani ko sunate hue aapaki tarah ke lakhon logon ke andar jo aadmi mara he, uski sajaa kya hogi? kaash
 
 
 In the times of tajirat-e-hind, there would have been an ointment of the dead human
 koi aisa jarrah hota jo piskar baandh detaa koi aisi booti jo hamaare bacchon ko buree najaron se bachaa leti
 Adam's children were not so bad that we were ashamed to call ourselves men
 gangrape ke aaropee vidhayak ke samarthan main aisa bayaan!kathua ho yaa unnav
 Whom to show your wound
 kyonki unnav ke rape kearopee vidhayak sengrake samarthan main bareli ke bauria ke ek vidhayak ajibo-garib bayaan dete hai
 MLA Surender Singh says that i do not believe Sengar would have raped
 kyonki teen bacchon kii maa ke saath koi bhi vyakti balaatkaar kaise kar saktaa he
 a statement that even the women of Surender Singh's house would not like to hear
 desh kii mahilaon kii to baat hi chhod dijie
 Why vote in the name of caste, religion? Actually, this statement shows the poor mentality of mlas like Surender Singh and Sengar
 koi bhi mahila inke liye kya haisiyat rakhti he
 But what difference does it make if they say so? But are only people like Sanji Rum, Sanger, Surender, Vishal, Sengar or Khajuria guilty in this? Are we not the responsible ones who see their profits in the business of lies? Knowing the movement and character of the people, they put their votes in the bag of such people for any specific purpose or any special benefit
 or badale main vah hamen shiksha se dur rakhte hai
 Keep us away from our rights
 hamen dharm or jaati ke jhagadon main ulajhaa dete hai
 When the child is going to leave the school, the heart will crackle and scream loudly about the incident of Unnao
 satta ko kosen
 Streets the leaders
 or ghar parivaar main or samaaj main yah dikhne kii koshish karen ki dekhiye kitni maanavtaa he hamamen
 But when you go to leave your girls till the school bus stop in the morning, the heart will be shocked
 insaaniyat par karen vishwasaham dua karte hai ki kathua or unnav ke pariwaron par jo hua wo hamaare or aapke pariwaron ke saath na ho
 But if just prayer is not enough, then we and you will have to think
 ki iskaa ilaaj kya he
 We have to decide as soon as possible that we have to find a cure for our restlessness
 koi sarkaar
 Any leader
 koi vyavastha hamaare hukuk hamen nahin de sakati or iske liye hamen dharm se
 
 
 From the politics of caste
 
 One has to believe in the unity of humanity
 sanji ram or senger jaise darindon ko milakar den javabaho saktaa he ki kathua or unnav kii ghatana kal tak sirf kathua or unnav kii ghatana thi
 but
 
 
 aaj ye har shahar or har ghar kii ghatana he
 The child of Kathua is the child of all
 unnav kii mahila main bhi vahi khun he, jo hamaari mahilaon ke badan main he
 The father who was wandering in the jungles of Kathua or seeking justice for his daughter from the rulers of Lucknow, do you not see your blood in the relationship of that father's body with blood? agar vah khun aapkaa he to ham yakeen dilaate hai ki ainda kisi senger kisi sanji ram kii himmat nahin padegi jo bahanon or betiyon kii taraf nazar bhi uthaa saken
 Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is still on ventilator
 ames main vaajapeyi kii haalat sthir bani hui he
 According to doctors, his blood pressure is still normal and his organs are functioning properly
 saath hi deshbhar main unki salaamati ke liye duaen maangi ja rahi hai
 The doctors are doing everything inside AIIMS
 desh ke chahete netaa atal bihari kii sehat main turant sudhaar ho
 At the same time, what leaders outside AIIMS have the public raised their hands in prayers
 bas yahi dua he vaajapeyi jald thik ho jaaen
 In AIIMS, there was an influx of people from common to special to know Vajpayee's well being
 sonia gandhi, somnath chatarji or pranab mukherjee ke alaava abhinayta sanjay dutt bhi pahunche atal kii tabiyat jaanane
 The heart of sister Kamla, who lives in Agra, is praying day and night for her ailing brother admitted in AIIMS
 desh main aisa koun he jo atal bihari vaajapeyi kii jaadui shakhsiyat kaa mureed naa ho
 Everyone is worried about his health
 unke jaldi ghar lautne kii
 AIIMS or Lucknow people are performing Yajna and Havan for the safety of their leader
 sabhi kii bas yahi yahi kaamana he unke pyaare netaa jaldi achche ho jaaen

 However, while he was campaigning as an independent, he was grabbing the attention of people by his note and vote manner and was not even in controversies, but as soon as Samajwadi Party put his hand on his shoulder, he went one after the other
 Troubles are mounting
 pehle unke namakan ko lekar vivaad, phir uske khaarij hone kaa vivaad, phir unka sapa ke pratyaashee ke prachaar kaa elaan karne ke baad ek or taaja vivaad
 Now a two-year-old alcoholic has come under his visual, trying to tarnish his image
 taaja vivaad kaa vishay bane is puraane video main kaha ja rahaa he ki 50 karod main piem ko khatm kar sakate hai
 After this video was going viral, people of BJP (BJP) also came forward to answer this, bjp's GVL Narasimha Rao tweeted and commented on it
 GVL Narasimha Rao, BJP: Stunned by statements of SP candidate,tej Bahadur Yadav
 He was drafted by SP from Varanasi, his candidature has been nullified for various reasons
 We can see on TV how he's telling a group that he's willing to hatch a plot to assassinate PM Modi for Rs50 cr pic

 During the sp's campaign in Varanasi, when reporters questioned him directly, he said, "ask him who is giving two crore rupees

 Listen what Tej Bahadur is saying about his new viral video pic 
 twitter
 com / 8gikod4rgf Who is benefiting from the controversial video of Tej Bahadur? Is Tej Bahadur surrounded by this? Or is it helping to make Tej Bahadur himself bigger? Is Tej Bahadur himself using it as a weapon against Modi? The answers to all these questions should be seen with the new tricks of SP
 tej bahadur ko lekar samaajawaadee party ne jo turup kii chaal chali he, lagata he usase bijepi kuch asahaj hui he
 And even if it has not happened, in every such dispute, SP and Tej Bahadur are trying to make Narendra uncomfortable by dragging Narendra Modi's name directly with BJP so that his fight can be seen directly against Modi
 biguef kaa barkhaast sipaahi isamen isliye sateek hathiyaar ban rahaa he kyonki is chunaav ko khud bijepi or modi ne rashtrawaad ke saath sena se jod diya he

 Today on the occasion of the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the entire nation is paying tribute to him
 pandit nehru kii aaj 130veen jayanti he, is avasar par desh ke kai hisson main kaarykram ho rahe hai
 Pandit Nehru's contribution is not forgotten by the country and the world, but at the same time there are many myths and many misconceptions about him
 aaj unki jayanti ke avasar par ham aisi hi kuch dharanaon kaa sach jaanane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 1
 subhash chandra bose kaa sammaan nahin kiyaneharu ke bare main ek myth yah prachaarit kiya jaataa he ki ve subhash chandra bose ke virdohi the or unka sammaan nahin kiya
 It is true that Gandhi and Nehru had sharp ideological differences with Subhash Chandra Bose, but this was not at odds with both and the two leaders respected each other
 ulte subhash chandra bose kii maut ke baad nehru netaji kii beti ko niyamit pension bhijwaya karte the
 Not only this, the matter of financial support was kept secret while respecting the privacy of the family and Netaji
 subhash chandra bose ke liye nehru apane pita ke khilaaf tak khadey ho gaye the
 In fact, a 'dominion States' proposal was proposed in the Congress Calcutta Admission under the chairmanship of Motilal Nehru, but Subhash Chandra Bose introduced an amendment against the proposal that India wanted nothing less than complete independence
 pandit nehru ne gandhi or motilal nehru ke khilaaf jane vaale is sanshodhan kaa purajor samarthan kiya
 Not only this, the Subhash with whom Nehru had sharp ideological differences, his slogan 'jaihind' made Nehru the slogan of the country
 15 agast ko laal kile se die jane vaale sambodhan main nehru ne ‘jaihind’ bolnaa shuru kiya
 After the death of Subhash Chandra Bose, Nehru set up an 'INA Defense Committee' to evacuate thousands of soldiers of the Azad Hind Fauj (INA) from British captivity and to save them from court martial
 ve khud in sainikon ke vakil bane or kaala choga dhaaran kar unki pairvi kii
 Also read: Children's Day was once celebrated on 20 November, then it was decided on the 14th date
 bhagat singh se jail main milane nahin gaenehru ke bare main yah myth yah bhi prachlit he ki jab krantikari sardaar bhagat singh jail main band the or unhen faansee kii sajaa di gai thi to nehru unase milane kabhi bhi jail main nahin gaye
 This is wrong
 nehru desh ke un chuninda bade netaaon main se the jo jail main jaakar bhagat singh or unke saathiyon se mili
 Nehru never praised Bhagat Singh's path of violence, but publicly praised his bravery and patriotism
 mahatma gandhi ke alaava bhagat singh hi aise vyakti the jinaki nehru ne sabase zyada tarif kii
 On 8 August 1929, Jawaharlal Nehru met the jailed Bhagat Singh and his companions and on 9 August he made a statement in Lahore
 2
 Sardar Patel and Nehru did not get along
 It is true that there have been sharp ideological differences between Pandit Nehru and Patel on many issues, but here too it can be said that this was not discrimination
 donon main aarthik masalon or sampradayikta ke masalon par kuch vaicharik matbhed the
 Many times there were such sharp ideological differences between the two that both agreed to resign
 lekin raashtra nirmaan ke liye donon miljulkar kaam karte rahe
 Sardar Patel completed the unique task of unification and merger of more than 500 princely states of the country under the guidance of Nehru
 mahatma gandhi kii hatya ke baad kaaphi dukhi sardaar patel ne naitikta ke aadhaar par istipha dene kaa faisla kiya
 After this Nehru wrote him a letter: 'when Bapu was alive, we hoped to meet Bapu together and discuss with him the things that had troubled us to some extent
 apane antim patr main maine yah aashaa vyakt kii thi ki mat or swabhaav ke kuch matbhedon ke baavjood hamen saath-saath kaam karte rahanaa chahie, jaisaa ki hamane itane lambey samay tak kiya he
 i am happy to know that Bapu's final opinion was the same
 ’4
 Promoted the English language - culture, Sanskrit protestant Nehru studied in London, but was fully connected to his soil
 unke bare main aksar yah log dharna bana lete hai ki unhone desh main angreji bhashaa, samskruti ko badhaava diya
 But the truth is that he was an advocate of promoting mother tongue, Sanskrit and swadeshi-khadi
 aazaadee ke baad desh main bhashaa kaa mudda garma gaya
 Then Nehru wrote a letter to the Chief Ministers of all the states on 6 December 1948, 'the question of language has become a matter of much debate
 mere khyaal se rajya kii buniyadi niti yah honi chahie ki bachche kii buniyadi shiksha uski maatrubhaasha main ho, aisa karne par bahut se bacchon ko isse phayda hoga
 Nehru wrote about Sanskrit, 'I do not know much of Sanskrit, yet i am a great admirer of Sanskrit
 mujhe ummid he ki aane vaale vakt main sanskrit ko bade paimaane par padhaa jayega
 '5
 anuchhed 370 nehru kii vajah se hi lagu huaek yah dharna bani hui ki anuchhed 370 pandit nehru kii vajah se hi lagu hua or sardaar patel iske virdohi the
 But this is also not true
 sach to yah he ki sardaar patel ne anuchhed 370 ko kashmir ke liye jaruri bataaya tha
 When Article 370 was being debated in the Constituent Assembly, then Nehru was out of the country and Sardar Patel informed Nehru about this debate
 khud sardaar patel ne samvidhan sabha main bahes ke dauraan is bare main tark diya tha ki kashmir kii vishesh samasyaon ko dekhte hue uske liye anuchhed 370 jaruri he
 Jawaharlal Nehru said in a letter to the Chief Ministers on 25 July 1952, "when we were finalizing the Constitution of India in November 1949, Sardar Patel looked into the matter
" tab unhone jammu or kashmir ko hamaare samvidhan main ek vishesh kintu sankramanakalin darja diya
 This status was entered into the Constitution as Article 370
 iske alaava 26 janvari 1950 ko raashtrapati ke aadesh ke madhyam se bhi ise darj kiya gaya
 Only a few parts of our Constitution apply to Kashmir through this Article and through this Order
 ’6
 a lot of raita has been spread on social media to discredit the accuser of colored mood
 unke bare main tamaam photose jari kar unhen ayyash bataaya jaataa he
 Actually it is also due to cultural gap
 nehru desh ke jis krimi layer yaa sampann parivaar se aate the vahaan auraton ke saath uthanaa- baithna, gale milanaa, cigarette pinaa aam baat thi, lekin ek bahut bada varg aisa he jise aisa expoger nahin hota or uski samskruti alag he
 Such people prove Nehru's bastard
 yahi nahin, iske bare main kai baar to kisi photo kaa galat sandarbh de diya jaataa he yaa uskaa photoshop kar diya jaataa he
 For example, a photo of Nehru being hugged with a young girl is shared, while this photo is not of an English woman but of an Indian woman
 yah bhartiya mahila or koi nahin balki nehru kii bhanji nayantara sahagal hai
 Nayantara Sehgal is the second daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru's sister Vijayalakshmi Pandit
 nehru kii bhanji ke saath photo, jise galat sandarbh main pesh kiya jaataa he7
 Promotion of dynasty One belief about Diane Nehru is propagated that he promoted dynasty
 isaki vajah yah he ki unki beti indira bharat kii pradhanmantri baniin or uske baad unke ‘gandhi parivaar’ kaa desh main lambey samay tak shashan rahaa
 The truth is that Nehru did not want his daughter Indira Gandhi to become Prime Minister
 gandhi parivaar ko agar raajnneeti main kisi ne aage badhaayaa he vah indira hai, nehru nahin
 Anyway, Indira Gandhi was not made the Prime Minister immediately after Nehru's death, but Lal Bahadur Shastri became the Prime Minister of the country
 haa yah jarur sach he ki indira gandhi pehle swatantraaa sangram or baad main congress kii raajnneeti main sakriy thim, jisaki vajah se unhone apana ek sthaan bana liya

 gandhi ke yogya uttaradhikari nahin thenehru ke bare main yah sabase jabardast dharna faili hui he ki vah gandhi ke yogya uttaradhikari nahin the or unase behatar patel the jinhen bharat kaa pehla piem bananaa chahie tha
 But the truth is that Sardar Patel also accepted Nehru's qualifications and accepted to work under Nehru's leadership
 gandhi ne pandit nehru ko desh kaa pehla piem isliye banaaya kyonki unki sweekaaryata desh ke har ilaake or har varg tak thi
 The rest of his options like Sardar Patel, Rajendra Prasad, Maulana Azad etc
 were leaders with mass support to certain classes and areas
 vah nirvivaadrup se gandhi ke baad congress ke sabase bade netaa ban gaye the
 Nehru was the mass leader of the country (photo: Getty Images)) 9
 taanaashaahee najariya rakhte thenehru ke bare main ek myth yah bhi he ki vah taanaashaahee tareeke se kaam karte the
 One reason for the formation of this belief could also be that Nehru could not become a very close friend and he could not raise any successor to him
 lekin sach yah he ki unhone desh main loktantric mulyon ko badhaane ke liye kaaphi kaam kiya
 He was a strong supporter of freedom of expression
 yahi nahin, aazaadee ke baad jo mantrimandal bani usamen pandit nehru apane ko sabase bada nahin balki ‘first amang ikvals’ yani baraabar ke logon main pradhan maanate the
 He was so democratic in this matter that Sardar Patel once explained to him that he is the Prime Minister and can interfere in the work of the rest of the cabinet ministers

 The economic model of Kienaharu ruined the country by its economic model is also considered to be a reason for the country's so-called 'waste'
 unki aarthik niti asal main samyawad or poonjeevaad kaa ek ghalmail thi jise nehruwadi samaajwaad bhi kaha gaya
 It is fine that their policies today seem somewhat strange, but for India of 70 years ago, such a policy was necessary, which was completely sucked up by the British and where food grains had to be imported
 ek garib desh main ghor poonjeevaad ko lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 Public welfare was important and also the protection of industries
 isliye nehru ne badi-badi sarkari companiyaan yani piesu kii sthapana kii jo bread se lekar steel tak ke utpaadan main shaamil thim
 There was a need to invest huge capital in all sectors like electricity, water, roads, mining in the country and then the private sector was not developed enough to be entrusted with this task

 At the same time, apart from demonetisation, Shatrughan Sinha has been questioning the current leadership of Modi and BJP from time to time and especially during elections
 mamata agar inako apane paale main laane main kaamyaab rahi to yah bijepi ke liye bhi jhatka hoga or mamata kii leadership ko takat milegi

 ) Controversy arose over the recommendation of shooter Ranjan Sodhi for the prestigious Khel Ratna award, as some members of the selection panel questioned his selection process
 pataa chalaa he ki jab adhiktar sadasyon ne khel ratna puraskaar ke liye matdaan karne kaa faisla kiya to sodhi kaa naam shaamil nahin tha lekin baad main use vichaar ke liye laayaa gaya
 a member of the selection panel said that 10 of the 12 members of the panel (excluding two SAI officials) voted for Commonwealth Games gold medalist discus thrower Krishna Punia and London Paralympic silver medalist HN Girisha Was chosen and Sodhi's name was not initially considered
 puraa drishy tab badal gaya jab ek anya sadsy or purv nishanebaaj baithak main der se aayaa or girisha kaa naam hataa diya gaya
 This was followed by voting between Sodhi and Poonia
 chayan panel ke sadsy ne gopneeyata kii shart par kaha, ‘chayan panel ke 12 sadasyon main se das baithak ke shuru main maujuud the
 Two members later arrived at the meeting
 ham das sadasyon ne punia or girisha ke bich khel ratna ke liye matdaan karaane kaa faisla kiya lekin ek sadsy ke aane ke baad sodhi kaa naam bhi shaamil ho gaya
 It is learned that it was decided to recommend Poonia's name first as most of the members were in her favor
 panel ke sadsy ke anusaar matdaan haath uthaakar kiya gaya jisamen sodhi or punia ko baraabar mat mili
 Sodhi's name was recommended due to the support of two Sai officials
 ek anya sadsy ne kaha ki sai ke do pratinidhi pehle girisha ke paksh main the lekin baad main unhone sodhi kaa samarthan kiya
 Sai officials, however, do not have voting rights
 chayan panel ke sadsy ne kaha, ‘khel ratna kii sifarish ke liye bahut sharmnaak raajnneeti kheli gayi
 i did not even realize it
 pehle sai adhikari girisha kaa samarthan kar rahe the jabaki punia or uske bich matdaan hona tha
 But when Sodhi's name came up, they started supporting him
 asal main sodhi or punia ke bich taai ho gaya tha lekin sai adhikariyon kaa samarthan sodhi ko mila
 'he said,' Some members suggested to recommend the names of both Poonia and Sodhi as it has happened before
 ’jabaki panel ke ek anya sadsy ne daawa kiya ki sodhi ke naam kii sifarish karne kaa sarvasammat faisla kiya gaya or sadasyon main koi matbhed nahin tha
 When the chairman of the committee was contacted about this, Ferreira declined to comment
 punia ne kaha ki vah is masale ko khel mantri jitendra singh ke samaksh rakhegi
 He said, 'we will inform the Sports Minister about this and will meet him if necessary

 ' dilli main shaadiyaan to hongi, lekin dijal jenerator par bain kii vajah se is sijan shaadiyon main raunak najar nahin aegi
 Everyone, from the wedding planner to the bride and groom, is worrying that there should be no disturbance in their function
 lihaaja dijal jenerator bain hone se bhavy shaadi samarohon ke liye is baar log dilli nahin balki gurugram or noida kaa rukh kar rahe hai or iskaa khamiyaja banquet haul oners se lekar tent house maalikon tak ko uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 According to Mohan Seth, chairman of the All India Tent Decorators Welfare Association, "the business has been hit badly after the diesel generator was banned
 march tak hi shaadiyon kaa sijan hota he
 In such a situation, there is no new booking now, because the genset is banned
 jin logon ne pehle se booking kar rakhi thi, unke function main bhi dikkatein aa rahi hai
 Maintaining the cooling of the banquet hall is a big challenge
 beshak sardiyaan shuru ho gai hai, lekin kisi function main bijli chali jaae, koi durghatana ho jaae to customer to naaraaz hoga hi or unka function kharaab ho jayega so alag
 The EPCA did not take the opinion of the traders
 Praveen Quatra, managing director of Tent House, told Aaj Tak that while deciding the genset ban, the EPCA should have once consulted the people involved in the marriage business
 dilli main log6-6 maheene pehle bookingkar lete hai, taaki unhen kisi tarah dikkat na ho
 But now people are upset, their phones are coming again and again and we have no problem
 marriage venue ke liye gurugram, noida bhaag rahe dilli ke lognoida ke wedding planar rahul ke kehete hai, "purvi dilli or south dilli ke bahut se logon ne approach kiya he
 But on the dates of weddings, Noida also has a Venue book
 isiilie log vikalp talash rahe hai, taaki unke ghar kii shaadi kii raunak barkaraar rahe
 "the DPCC and EPCA have received numerous applications for permission to run gensets on the occasion of marriage
 lekin EPCA ne sabhi aavednon ko khaarij karte hue kaha he ki pradooshan se nipatane kii is ladaai main koi kotahi nahin barti jaaegi
 EPCA has asked DISCOM to provide people with 50 KV temperature connection in exchange for gensets so that people do not have any difficulty in organizing the wedding
 saath hi logon se apil kii he ki wo elidi liton kaa istemaal karen, taaki bijli kii khapat kam se kam ho
 But if wedding planners believe that even a connection of 50 kv will not solve their difficulties
 shubh muhoort par kai shaadiyaan hoti hai
 In such a situation, the need for electricity also increases
 jaraa sochie agar jayamala ke vakt achaanak bijli trip kar jaae to hamaari kya izzat rah jaaegi
 In the presence of 500–800 people, it is risky to do any program without back-up
 tamaam suraksha intjaamon ke baavjood shaadiyon main aksar chori kii ghatnaayen bhi hoti rahati hai
 That is why genset is necessary as a precaution

 There was one country, divided into two parts

 doosraa hissaa pashchimi germany, jiske bare main kaha jaataa tha ki hitler ke liye logon ke dilon main ab bhi narmi he
 East Germany wanted to develop itself as a socialist nation
 logon kaa palaayan or naukariyon ke avasar jaise kai mudde the jinpar germany ke in do hisson main aksar tanatani dekhne ko milti thi
 The wall of hearts was removed on the ground
 13 agast 1961 ko dono hisson ke bich diwaar khadi kar di gai
 With which the contact between West and East Germany was cut off completely
 dekhen google kaa video doodle:ye diwaar 28 saalon tak kaayam rahi
 During this time, more than 100 people lost their lives trying to jump to another part of the country
 1989 main is diwaar ko gira diya gaya
 Those whose families have suffered the brunt of the partition can understand what it means when a sudden border is created between the families
 1989 main 9 november ke hi din berlin kii ye diwaar gira di gai thi
 Millions of people living in both parts had come to witness the incident on both sides of the wall

 bollywood ke mashhoor mujeec compoger aadesh shrivastav kuch maheene pehle cancer ke shikaar hue the
 He was admitted to the Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital when the condition became critical
 khabar he ki pichley kai hafton se aadesh vahiin daakhil hai or unki haalat pehle se bhi zyada najuk he
 The entire treatment of order cancer is being done in this hospital from the beginning
 lekin aspataal ke hawaale se koi bhi taaja khabar nahin ai he kyonki aspataal kaa kahana he kiadesh ke parivarajanis maamle main privesi menten karnaa chaahate hai
 Today, the matter of the incident in which opening of the eyes is forbidden, because whatever happens in a particular area on the night of Janmashtami
 use dekhne kii ijazat kisi ko nahin
 This sequence is centuries old
 magar raat ke is raaj kaa gavaah ajtak koi nahin ban paaya
 It is not that people did not try to investigate
 balki ye raaj jisane bhi janaa wo is raaj ko dusron ko bataane laayak bachaa hi nahin
 So what is the secret of this night, humans can see the whole universe sitting on the ground
 magar jis ilaake kii ham baat kar rahe hai, vahaan insaan wo khaas raat chaah kar bhi nahin dekh saktaa he
 Because here, who can see what and when, they decide not human beings
 or isiilie is ilaake main jane vaale log raat to raat din main bhi apane kadam phoonk phoonk kar rakhte hai
 It is said that on this night, Lord Krishna creates Maharas with his Radha here
 jise dekhne kii ijaajat kisi insaan ko nahin he
 This tradition in Nidhivan is centuries old
 jise aaj bhi kaayam rakhaa gaya he
 Nobody has known this secret till date
 insaani zehan ko to phir bhi bargalaaya ja saktaa he
 He may be forced to believe a story
 magar jaanwaron par to kisi kaa bas nahin chalata he
 They also do what they have to do
 phir bhi chamatkaar kahen yaa koi ishwariya lila ki is ilaake ke tamaam jaanavar shaam hote hi apana thikaana badal lete hai

 is satr main aditi maheshwari, or bhagwant anamolshamil hue
 Vani Prakashan's head Aditi Maheshwari said that Hindi is the biggest market in the country, everything is sold in it
 hindi main jo likhegaa-bikega-tikega, jo acha likhegaa vahi bikega
 He said that the publisher is a philosopher, he also has many faces and thoughts, which have to be seen a lot
 prakaashak ke edetorial board kaa bhi mahatv he, unhen kitaab or contate kaa experions hota he
 This board is necessary to understand the book
 sahitya ajtak LIVE kaverepaditi ne kaha ki soshal media ke jamaane logon main bechaini ai he
 Now people want immediate results, which is harmful for writers
 likhane se pehle bahut research kii jarurat he, uske liye fasebuk-twitor se baahar nikal kitabon main aana padegaa
 Young writer Bhagwant Anmol said that till some time ago it is believed that the writer is the one who has white beard, things have changed in the last five years that now black beard is also considered a writer
 unhone kaha ki jab main 21 saal kaa tha to pehali kitaab chhapavane pahunchaa, to kisi prakaashak ne mujhe lekhak nahin mana tha
 He said that writing can not help a living; writing gives as much money as bonus on Diwali

 There is a lot of ruckus within the party on who will be the state president of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Rajasthan
 gaur ho ki isi saal november-disambar main rajasthan main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai or pichley 16 april se rajasthan bijepi main party kaa kaman sanbhaalane vaala koi nahin he
 After meeting Vasundhara Raje and the party's national president Amit Shah on Friday, Raje has returned to Jaipur, a cabinet minister and pro-bjp Vasundhara MLA, but it is not yet clear who will be the party's next state president
 BJP mukhyalay se nikalate vakt dilli main vasundhara raaje ne patrakaron se ishaare main kaha ki 'aap mere chehre par khushi dekh sakate ho'
 Various speculations are being made in this regard of Vasundhara in Rajasthan
 idhar, jis tarah se kendriya krishi rajya mantri gajendra singh shekhavat kaa pradesh adhyaksh ke liye naam tay karne ke baavjood bijepi kaa kendriya netritv naam kii ghoshnaa nahin kar paa rahaa he, use dekhakar lagata he ki vasundhara raaje is baar bijepi ke kendriya netritv par baari pad gai hai
 This is the first time the BJP high command has failed to implement its own decision
 vasundhara raaje ne is tarah se chunauti di he ki ise lagu kiya gaya to rajasthan main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi kii lutiyaa dub sakati he
 Vasundhara Raje put forward her Rajput ministers and mlas for not making Rajput President in Rajasthan BJP
 devi singh bhaati ne to khuleam gajendra singh shekhavat par aarope laga die
 But the national leadership of Bijuri, considered to be a rung of discipline, is dwarf ahead of Vasundhara this time
 mana ja rahaa tha ki amit shah se mulaakaat ke baad maamla sulajh jayega lekin hua kuch bhi nahin
 There is still a lot of speculation about who will become the president
 aisa kaha ja rahaa he ki gajendra gajendra singh shekhavat pradhanmantri narendra modi kii pasand hai, aise main amit shah ab yah faisla nahin le sakate ki gajendra singh shekhavat ko pradesh adhyaksh nahin banaaya jaae
 In this case, something is possible only after discussion with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, so it is also being said that maybe the post of BJP state president in Rajasthan remains vacant till the Karnataka elections
 logon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki jab naam tay nahin ho paa rahe the to aanan-fanan main maujuudapradesh adhyakishok paranami ko 16 april ko hataane kii kya jarurat thi

 If the pioneers of eighties regnomics and the originators of trickle down theory arrived in today's India, they might have to devise a new theory called trickle up theory
 trical down theory vaale kehete the ki samaaj ke upree tabake yani udyog-kaarobaar ko riyaayaten dekar maang badhaai ja sakati he jo nichle tabake tak rojgaar va kamai pahunchaayegi
 But the leaders of this theory will have no problem in proving in today's India that sometimes the growth in a country's economy does not go from the top to the bottom, but where the growth of a huge economy is at its largest
 Except for a handful of trades
 bhartiya arthvyavastha ab ek thri speed iconomi he, jisamen tej growth arthvyavastha ke upree 30 fisadi hisse main rah gai he, jahaan i- commers, trevell, stock market aadi he
 The second 30 per cent of the industries are in the growth of the unit and the third part of agriculture, building construction etc
 is in negative growth
 yah paridrishy desh main pehali baar dekha gaya he
 Which is presented with a very challenging challenge of maintaining growth in one place, increasing in another place and bringing growth back in the third place
 is chunauti kii roshni main 2016 kaa bajet bada samvedansheel ho jaataa he
 It is important to understand this environment of an economy with three different speeds because the next one or two years of growth, investment and employment are very strong on this scenario
 mumbai kii research form ambit capital kaa taaja adhyayan thri speed iconomi ko gaharaai se samajhane main hamaari madad karata he
 The study is based on data on the growth of various segments contributing to GDP
 arthvyavastha main sabase tej daudaahe vaale teen kshetron main tej raftaar vaala pehla hissaa vah he jisamen parivahan (khaas taur par avinshan), hotel, commercial property, i-commers or kaarobaari sevaayen aati hai
 Running at double-digit pace, the sector accounts for 30 per cent of GDP
 gaur talab he ki bhale hi bhawan nirmaan udyog main mandi ho lekin commercial property bik rahi he
 Similarly, despite the slowdown in the consumer goods market, e-commerce is active
 is tej daudaahe vaali arthvyavastha main venture capital or pii fund ke jariye nivesh aayaa he
 Apart from this, high income investors are also active in it
 is hisse main jaldi mandi kii ummid bhi nahin haimajholi gati vaala doosraa hissaa bhi jidipi main 30 fisadi kaa hissedaar he
 Ambit's study shows that it includes commercial vehicles i
e
 automobiles, manufacturing, residential building construction and mining sectors
 is kshetra main ikai kii gati se marial growth darj ho rahi he
 Here, debt-ridden companies are struggling with balance sheet receipts, in which new corporate investment is not possible due to debt
 isliye menuphaccharing kshetra ke kuch hisson main maamuli growth dikhti he
 For the past two quarters, there has been a stagnation in port transport and railway freight movement, while coal and electricity have registered a decline
 shunya yaa nakaaratmak growth vaala teesraa hissaa kheti, samgr bhawan va infrastracchar nirmaan, prashasnic sevaayen va banking he
 These all account for 40 per cent of GDP
 sarkari kharch, cement, steel aadi kii maang va utpaadan or aay va rojgaron main vruddhi ke aankade sabit karte hai ki in chaar kshetron main haalat sabase buree he

 Has come to 5 percent
 bainkon kii haalat buree he, munaafe ghota kha rahe hai or karj kii maang puri tarah khatm ho chuki he
 On the other hand, the demand for cement steel has not increased due to lack of infrastructure investment due to cuts in government spending

 The three-speed economy has led to two kinds of inconsistencies at the governance and policy levels
 isane sarkaar ko bhramit kar diya he
 The last two budgets passed in the same dilemma whether to run the race further, then to overcome the recession or to face the real recession directly
 duusari asangati yah he ki jidipi ke 30 fisadi hisse main chamak or 70 fisadi main susti ke kaaran arthvyavastha kii suurate-haal ko bataane vaale aankadon ko lekar gahari uhapoh he
 The most practical difficulty of the three-speed economy is that 70% of the economy, which has suffered a slowdown or deep recession, includes farming, building construction and manufacturing, which are the biggest source of employment
 sirf 30 fisadi arthvyavastha kii chamak 'suut-boot kii sarkaar' jaisi rajnatik bahason ko takat de rahi or aarthik gavarnence ko dakiyanoosee sabsidvaad kii taraf dhakel rahi he jo or badi samasya he
 After this three-speed economy, we should stop dividing GDP into agriculture, industry, service sectors and look at the million economies that are hidden within these three major parts and the role of protagonists and actors in recession, growth and employment
 Is playing thri speed iconomi ek ajeeb tarah kii viklaangata he jise sanbhaalane ke liye sookshm upayon kii jarurat he
 Of course, the remedies for such economic challenges lie not in outright budgetary panacea but in small measures that require the government to leave the macro management and treat the area like experts
 arun jetali, haal ke itihaas main pehle vitt mantri honge jo is tarah kii pechida growth ganit se mukaabil hai
 Before resolving this problem, they have to prove in the budget of 2016 whether the government is able to understand the problem or not
 chaliye, bajet kaa intjaar karte hai

 Before understanding the winning strategy of Team Indiavirat Kohli, when will the first match play in the World Cup, it is very important to know that when Team India will take the field before the semi-final match
 sabase pehle team india maidan par 5 june buudhvaar ko utregi jo match khelaa jayega bharat banaam south africa, roj boul, south hampton main , uske baadah-9 june, ravivaar ko bharat banaam australia, kennington ovel, landan13 june, guuruuvaar ko bharat banaam new jiland, trent brij, nottingam16 june, ravivaar ko bharat banaam pakistan, old traverd, manchester22 june, shanivaar ko bharat banaam afghanistan, da roj bol south hampton30 june, ravivaar ko england banaam bharat, edbeston, birmingam2 july, mangalvaar ko bangladesh banaam bharat, edbeston, birmingam6 july, shanivaar ko shri lanka banaam bharat, hedingle, leadsround robin tareeke se kul 8 match bharat ke hisse main hai

 And we have a good and strong team
 sabhi khilaadi achche farm main hai

 Apart from that, playing by changing the strategy according to time, for example, Dhoni came to the field to bat at number 5 in the 2011 finals and lead the team to victory, as the decision is also part of cricket's Chanakya policy is believed
 asal main, sahi samay par sahi faisla hi jeet ke lakshya ko hasil kara saktaa he

 ab ghar kharidne kii stregal main kai sari ghatnaayen hone lagati hai, bhalla kii mulaakaat lavali bhai (manoj pahwa) se hoti he or phir kahani main kai saare twist terns aate hai
 The script story is very general

 The pace of the film is very weak, which may cause trouble, due to which it may be difficult to pull the audience to the theater

 Otherwise wait till you come on TV
 haalia vidhansabha chunaav vaale paanch rajyon main se chaar main sarkaar banane ke baad bijepi main utsaah kaa maahaul he
 However, the by-election for the Dholpur assembly seat in Rajasthan remains a question of prestige for the BJP
 yahaan 9 april ko vot daale jane hai
 For the Chief Minister of Rajasthan and 'empress of Dholpur' Vasundhara Raje, the Dholpur by-election also poses a question of her credibility
 dhaulpur se pichley chunaav main jite bi el kushvaha ko hatya ke maamle main sajaa hone kii vajah se yahaan upachunaav kii naubat ai
 Now Kushwaha's wife Shobharani is the bjp's candidate in the by-election
 jahaan tak congress kaa sawaal he to vahaan se koun uskaa ummidavaar hoga, abhi tak ye bhi tay nahin kar pai he
 The BJP and especially the minorities are angry, so despite the code of conduct, on the same day, the former MLA Abdul Sagir was given a red light by giving the status of Minister of State
 vasundhara raaje or bijepi dhaulpur seat par koi kasar nahin chhodana chaahati hai
 That's why three of the three ministers of the BJP and Vashundhara Raje's son-in-law Dushyant Singh themselves are roaming in Dholpur
 bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh ashok paranami ne bhi dhaulpur main deraa daal rakhaa he
 Parnami says that the imprisoned former BSP MLA BL Kushwaha is holding a good hold in the area
 unhone ab bispi chhod di he isliye unki patni shobhaarani ko bijepi main shaamil kar dhaulpur se ummidavaar banaaya gaya he
 Those campaigning for the BJP included Medical Minister Kalicharan Saraf, Panchayat Raj Minister Rajendra Singh Rathore, Water Resources Minister Dr
 rampratap,parivahan evam saarvajanik nirmaan mantri younis khan,karauli-dhaulpur saansad dow
 Manoj Rajoria is accompanied by Abdul Sagir Khan, Minister of State in the by-election, Livestock Development Board President Jagmohan Singh Baghel, former MLA Jaswant Singh Gurjar, former MLA Shivram Kushwaha, former MLA Sukhram Koli
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki bijepi is koshish main he ki kisi tarah segel se parolpar biel kushvaha ko nikalvaaya jaae jisase chunaav prachaar main phayda uthaaya ja sake
 Opponents say that the BJP, which advocates morality, has no problem in growing closer to a convicted person and making his wife a candidate
 bijepi main itani sakriyata he to congress sust raftaar se chal rahi he
 a list has been sent to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi to decide the name of the candidate for the by-election
 rahul gandhi ne videsh jane se pehle kya tay kiya he jaipur main ye kisi ko pataa hin nahi chal paa rahaa he
 Banwari Lal Sharma, who won the election ten times on a Congress ticket five times, is waiting for the green signal to file his nomination
 congress kii taraf se kaha ja rahaa he ki baari tamzam ke saath ham namakan daakhil karnaa chaahate hai isiilie intjaar kar rahe hai
 There is also confusion in the Rajasthan Congress about who among the party state president Sachin Pilot or former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is given more importance from the party high command
 bataa den ki rajasthan vidhansabha ke liye 2018 main chunaav hone hai
 Before that this by-election will be seen as a mandate on the functioning of the Vasundhara government
 dhaulpur khud vasundhara kaa ghar bhi he, isliye unke liye ye upachunaav bahut ahm ho gaya he

 Something similar happened to the current Home Minister Amit Shah about 10 years ago, when agencies were behind him
 lekin ab samay badal gaya he or khel bhi badal gaya he
 The opposition, including the Congress party, is accusing the government of misusing the agencies

 When CBI arrested Amit Shah During the press conference on July 25, Amit Shah was arrested by CBI, he remained behind bars for three months
 iske baad unhen 2 saal tak gujarat se baahar rahane kaa aadesh diya gaya
 After this, on October 29, 2010, the High Court of Gujarat bailed Amit Shah
 amit shah kii giraftaar ke baad bhaajapa bhadki hui thi or unhone upie sarkaar par badale kii karrwai karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Until 2012, Amit Shah remained outside Gujarat, relieved before the 2012 assembly elections and the Supreme Court allowed him to go to Gujarat

 Ever since i started working with t-series, it has transformed into a new experience

 And at the same time i am very thankful that they noticed my talent and trusted me

 Bhushanji has given me a big chance and i am dedicated to making my mark in Bollywood, working very hard and doing my best
 ”A post shared by Nora Fatehi (@norafatehi) on Jan 5, 2019 at 6:27am pstnora fatehi (nora Fatehi) ne 'satyamev jayate' ke 'dilbar (dilbar)' song par apane Belly Dance se sabko hairaan kar diya tha
 Nora Fatehi has also done a Punjabi song 'naah' with Hardy Sandhu
 nora fatehi indo-canadian mul kii hai
 Nora Fatehi made her debut with the Bollywood film 'roar: Tigers of the Sundarbans'
 ve 'kreji kukkad family' main bhi najar aa chuki hai
 Nora was seen as a wild card contestant in 'bigg Boss 9' but she was out of Bigg Boss house after three weeks
 dhaula kuna main vaahanon ke jam main aksar fanse jane se pareshaan parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ne jam ke kaarnon kaa pataa lagane ke liye ek adhyayan karaane kaa nirdesh diya he
 Many areas of the national capital are affected by this problem
 gadakari ne loksabhaa main kaha ki hawaii adda jane yaa vahaan se aane ke dauraan dhaula kuna main aksar jam main funsane par main sir pakad letaa hum
 Responding to the discussion on the Motor Vehicles Act, Gadkari said that he has instructed the Road Research Institute to conduct a study on the vehicular jams and accident prone areas of the capital, the report of which will be submitted to the Delhi government
 kitaab:darra-darra himalayalekhak:ajay sodaniprakashak:sarthak (raajakmal prakaashan kaa ek upkram)mulya:150 rupee‘darra-darra himalay’ aisi kitaab nahin he, jisamen himalay kii god main based hill steshnon kii kahani ho, jise padhate hue ham yaad karen ki are nainital ke is hotel main to ham bhi tehre the, shimla ke restaraan main baithkar hamane bhi mal kaa najaara liya tha
 We also saw snow in Rohtang
 meri bhanji barf se phisal gai thi or use badi chot ai thi
 This is a different journey
 himalay ke durgam darron kaa
 Not to conquer them, but to look at them closely
 vah dekhne kaa ki aakhir puraana, itihaas, apane schuli kitabon
 How is that world of stories of old men? In fact, while reading this, i remembered the memoir of the Mansarovar Yatra by noted historian Shekhar Pathak
 isliye nahin ki is vrittant kii usase kuch samanta he
 Because, while reading it, the mind was going to go on a journey to Mansarovar just like reading 'pass Pass Himalayas' once more, the mind of Himalaya appeared
 or kahin se nahin to kam se kam dalhousie yaa manali se hi sahi
 It is also a quality of travelogue
 likhane vaala hamen usamen apane saath lekar chalane lagata he
 He himself becomes a travel companion and makes us his companion
 kabhi hamaare guide kii tarah, kabhi rochak kahani sunaane vaale safar main saath chalane vaale kisi sahyatri kii tarah
 Full of mystery
 mujhe yaad he maine skool ke dinon main mohan rakesh kaa yatra vrittant padhaa tha- aakhir chattan tak
 Do not know how many times i have traveled to different cities of South India, i do not know how much has changed
 bengalooru ko phulon ke shahar se jam main tehre shahar main badalte dekha
 But even today, if i go somewhere in the south, i remember the same book by Mohan Rakesh
 yaa cheedon par chandani! mukt yatra kii waisi unmukt kitaab shaayad hi koi padhi ho
 Perhaps this is what the liberation of the heart is called
 baharhaal, ajay sodani kii kitaab ‘darra darra himalay’ main multah do yatraaon kaa varnan he
 The first journey is of Kalindi Khal, which has been called the Sirmour of the passes
 yah romaanchak yatra lekhak ne puure parivaar ke saath kii
 This is another attraction of this
 kitaab main yah darj he ki sodani parivaar kaa naam limca book of main darj he ki 2006 main is darre ko paar karne vaala yah pehla parivaar bana
 The second journey is further from Uttarkashi, Gangotri, which the author says on the footsteps of the Pandavas
 jiskaa uddeshy himalay kii biodivarsity ko dekhnaa samajhnaa bataaya gaya he
 In the middle of the voyages, there are some famous travelers' memorials under the 'beyond the Yatras', some diary-like teas
 sabase badhkar, ek yatri kaa lekhak ek rup main roopantarit hota vyaktitv he
 Seeing the snowy beauty of the mountains, seeing the Avalancha is slowly changing
 aap ek pathak ke rup main us roopantaran ko mahasoos kar sakate hai
 Initially the prose is descriptive which gradually becomes poetic
 bich bich main lekhak ne kavitaayen, sher aadi bhi uddhrut kiye hai
 The book is published under the 'sarthak' series, which is a venture of Rajkamal Prakashan to connect directly with the readers
 yah acha he ki prakaashak ab pathakon kii taraf rukh kar rahe hai, ve is baat ko samaj gaye hai ki kitabon ko pustakaalayon ke godaamon se baahar nikalne kaa samay aa gaya he
 There is no doubt that book fairs, literature festivals have slowly started to create the atmosphere through which books are becoming bad readers
 aisi kitabon kii hindi main nitant aavashyaktaa he, jisamen vidhaon kaa lod na ho, tathakthith saamaajikta kaa boj na ho
 That false sentiment towards the peasant-laborers, who made the critics critical for generations, has served to mislead the readers
 yah acha he ki is baat kii samaj hindi main bhi bad rahi he ki sahitya asal main madhyavargeey upkram he or iskaa ek uddeshy pathakon aanandit karnaa bhi hota he
 It was not his job to change the society, educate the readers
 is baat kii samaj lekhakon main bhi badi he or acchhee baat he ki prakashkon main bhi
 Which has started appearing in the professional perspective of the presentation of books
 ‘darra darra himalay’ bahut sundar dhang se aakalpit pustak he jo aane vaale samay main path pradarshak sabit hogi, ek pathak-lekhak ek rup main mujhe lagata he
 In due course of time, Hindi writers should come from the Masab of Hindi departments, not from the farmers-laborers brand certificate, but from the perspective of readers
 hindi ke aatmavishvaas ke liye yah jaruri he
 However, if you go to a city in the lap of the Himalayas, then i will take 'pass Pass Himalaya' to study there
 vahaan isko padhne kii anubhuti alag hi hogi
 If you get a chance at the moment, then you will read it in the midst of the run-of-the-mill life of vehicles in their respective grounds

 (courtesy of 'jankipul') gujarat ke surat main ek hotel main ek shaks ne apni premika (24) ko aag ke hawaale kar diya
 The girlfriend died in this incident
 police ne aaropee premi ke khilaaf cese darj karke premika ke shav postmortem ke liye bhej diya he
 According to the information, the lover-girlfriend of Valsad arrived at Surat's Hotel Raviraj on Tuesday night
 buudhvaar ko unke bich apane sambandhon ko lekar bahes ho gai
 Accused Shivkishore beat his girlfriend Bhavana badly
 iske baad gusse menusane use aag ke hawaale kar diya
 The incident took place around eleven o'clock in the morning
 uske baad shiv kishor ne hotel se bhaagane kii koshish kii, lekin hotel ke karmchaariyon ne use pakadakar police ke hawaale kar diya
 According to police officer sdsalunke, the lover has confessed to his crime
 usne bataaya ki use bhaavana ke charitra par shaq tha
 He also suspected that he had a relationship with another man
 ham nirankush raja ke shashan vaale koi bananaa republic nahin hai
 "this is to say that of the officer who turned businessman on the strength of political ties, he also lost the remaining credibility of Robert Vadra
" 1991 main haryana cader jwine karne ke baad se hi 47 varshiya ashok khemka ne bhartiya prashasnic seva ke anadhikarik aadesh-hukum mantri kaa, dastakhat tumhaare-kaa lagaataar ulanghan kiya he
 He says, "all of us (civil servants) are part of the government
 pradhanmantri or mukhyamantri hamaare maalik nahin balki janasevak hai, jaise ki baaki ham sab log hai
 But we started to understand these people like a king and queen, whose orders are kept without obeying anyone
 ’’khemka ke is gusse ko samaj ja saktaa he
 On October 11, Khemka, who pointed fingers at the relationship between Robert Vadra and real estate giant DLF, who helped each other, was removed as the head of the Land Registration Department of Haryana with immediate effect
 kai netaa or afasar yahi chaahate the
 a dispatch clerk took the transfer order to his residence in Chandigarh after 10 pm
 kyonki teen din pehle khemka ne haryana ke chaar jilon gudgaanv, faridabad, palaval or mevaat main wadra ke sabhi jameen saudon kii suchi maangi thi
 This news became the headlines of newspapers and TV on 8 October
 khemka ne chaaron jilon ke dipti kamishnaron ko nirdesh diya tha ki ve 1 janvari, 2005 ke baad wadra yaa unki taraf se kii gai registry ke bare main saare dastavejon kii suchi banaakar unhen den
 At the end of September, Khemka had come to know that Vadra-owned Skylight Hospitality Private Limited in February 2008 from farmers of village Shikohpur 3
 53 acre jameen kharidi he
 Skylight has built 7 for this plot located about 40 km from Delhi
 5 karod ru
 Were given is jameen kaa malikana haq 24 ghante ke bheetar hi 13 farvari se lagu kar diya gaya jabaki aam taur par isamen chah maheene tak lag jate hai
 On March 28, 2008, Vadra's company also got permission to say that 2
 7 acre jameen ke liye land yuj ke license main badlaav (sielue) kar sake or us par awasaiya makaanon kaa nirmaan kar sake
 But in less than four months, Vadra gave this land to DLF Universal for Rs 58 crore
 main bech di
 According to Khemka, Vadra's company did so much in this land that it changed the land use license, which increased the value of this land by six times
 skylite ko aavedan ke 18 din ke bheetar or plot kharidne ke ek maah ke baad hi license main badlaav kaa aashay patr (eloai) thama diya gaya
 The LOI was approved by Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and a letter containing information was sent to Skylight with the signature of Chhatar Singh, one of Hooda's principal secretaries
 chatar singh kaa daawa he ki unhen is maamle kaa vivaran yaad nahin he or unhone jor diya ki har kaam kanoon ke mutabik hi hua he
 Importantly, it usually takes up to 90 days for the LOI to be approved on CLU applications
 india today dwaara bheji gai ek vistrut prashnawali par dlef ne jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya
 In this, we had asked whether he had taken advantage of the increase in the value of the Shikohpur plot due to the undue grace of the Haryana government and what kind of relationship he had with Vadra
 khemka ke ruchi lene ko 8 aktubar ko media main jor-shor se uthaaya gaya or khabaron main aisa sanket diya gaya ki sambhavat: wadra ke swaamitv vaali skylite realty, real arth estate, blue brij trading, artex or north india ity parks ne bhi isi tarah kaa tarika apanaaya ho
 Farm land was purchased, land use converted and sold to real estate companies
 lekin isaki jaanch karne vaale vyakti ko apni 21 saal kii seva main 43veen baar transfar ke aadesh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Although Khemka is 'satisfied' with his transfer, he is known as the 'most pushed officer' of Haryana and posting as a shjaja is common for him
 unke dost unhen ‘‘ehtiyaat’’ eemaandaar or drudhy vyakti bataate hai
 He was posted to the Land Consolidation, Records and Registration Department on July 20, 2012 before being removed as the Managing Director at Hartron, the state's electronics development corporation 
 unhone bina tender ke badhaai gai raashi par projects ke aavanton par sawaal uthaae the
 Even after the transfer, Khemka did not get scared
 mukhya sachiv ko 12 aktubar ko ek patr likhakar unhone apane ko achaanak hataae jane ke nirnay par punarvichaar karne ko kaha
 He gave a list of seven such villages in which "hundreds of crores of Panchayats"
 mulya kii jameen aisi real estate companiyon ko de di gai jo kuch dinon pehle hi khadi hui thim
 "these villages are bad-gujar, rojka-gujar, Kot, Chirasi, Ankhir, Shikohpur, Malikpur, Bangar and Kalesar located parallel to the gurgaon-faridabad road near Delhi
 iske baad 15 aktubar ko unhone haryana ke chakbandi or bhoomi record vibhaag ke diarector general sah registration inspector general ke rup main apana antim dhamaakaa kiya
 He issued a three-page order 3 of Shikohpur
 53 acre plot ke malikana haq tabdili ko radd karne kaa aadesh diya
 But within 24 hours, the state government rejected the order
 16 aktubar ko jari spashtikaran main is aadesh ko niyam viruddh bataate hue kaha gaya ki isamen kisi bhi party ko apana paksh rakhane kaa avasar nahin diya gaya
 Khemka says that in this case, the parties did not need to put their point because there has never been any dispute about its facts
 unhone kaha, ‘‘sarkaar yah jaanati he ki malikana haq tabdili ko koi bhi sakasham rajasav adhikari hi nae sire se lagu kar saktaa he
 "they rejected it because this work was done by the Assistant Consolidation Officer of Gurgaon, who is not a competent officer for the change of ownership
" khemka kaa janm kolkata ke ek madhya vargeey marwari parivaar main hua tha
 His father Shankarlal Khemka worked as an accountant in the Alliance Jute Mill
 khemka iity-khadipur ke topper chaatr the
 He did his phd in Computer Science in 1990 from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai
 iske ek saal baad hi unka chayan bhartiya prashasnic seva (iees) main ho gaya
 Khemka and his family have lived in a simple two-room house in the Haryana government's transit quarters in Chandigarh since 1997, while in 2007 he was promoted to senior rank as financial commissioner and he got a big bungalow from Quaid
 needed
 unke study room main steel ke furniture, ek bed or ek jang lagi puraani godarej aalmaari dikhti he
 On October 14, a day before he was issued an order to cancel the vadra-dlf deal, he received a number of threatening calls warning that he and his family would be badly injured
 aisi kol main unako jaan se maarane ke liye supaari dene kii bhi dhamkee di ja rahi thi
 Khemka described it as "worrying"
 unke parivaar ko koi suraksha nahin mili hui he or unka 18 varsh se kam umr kaa betaa aksar chandigarh se dakshin bharat ke apane college tak aata-jaataa rahata he
 The request of this officer to provide security, Haryana Chief Secretary P
P
 ke
 Chaudhary has ignored
 ashok khemka par bahut zyada dabaav he jo saaf dikh rahaa he
 On October 16, Khemka burst into tears at least twice during the long debate on TV
 ve kehete hai ki unhen kisi baat kaa dar nahin he kyonki ve sahi hai
 Still, he says, "even if there is a price to be paid, i would consider it my destiny
