 BJP got 83 seats from these states while Congress got only 3 seats
 isi vajah se congress philhal inhen rajyon main sabase zyada mehnat karti hui bhi dikh rahi he
 Three of these four states are going to have assembly elections in December and the Congress has given full strength to it
 gujarat chunaav main bhi congress ne bhaajapa ko haraane main koi kasar nahin chodi, yah alag baat he ki use apekshit safalataa nahin mili
 BJP leader ve

 narsimharav kehete hai, ''jahaan hamaara congress se sidhaa muqabla he, vahaan hamen or zyada phayda milegaa
 Our seats will increase because factors like casteism, communalism do not work much there

 "on the issue of inflation, Rao says," One should not just look at the inflation of petrol and diesel
 overol mahangaai nahin badi he
 Congress spokesperson Rajeev Tyagi says, "out of the seats where BJP has a direct contest with Congress, this time Congress will be ahead in 80% because the voters have been troubled by the policies of the central and state governments
 kisaanon or naujavaanon ko kuch nahin mila he, donon hataash hai
 The election will be fought on issues like transparent governance, implementation of manifest, inflation and unemployment
 ''yah sach he ki vidhansabha chunaav main jane vaale teenon rajyon main lambey samay se kabiz bhaajapa ko satta virdohi rujhaanon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he lekin bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah chunavi rajyon ke tabadatod daure kar congress ke 70 saalon kaa hisaab maangate hue apni sarkaron kaa uplabdhiyaan gina rahe hai
 The BJP believes that the equations for the Lok Sabha elections are quite different
 in teenon chunavi rajyon main loksabhaa kii 65 siten hai jinamein se congress ne 2014 main sirf 2 siten jiti thim
 Its performance in the assembly elections may affect its prospects in the Lok Sabha elections
 isi kaa nateeja he ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne in rajyon main din-raat ek kar diya he
 The Congress President himself has put a stop to the talk of himself being the prime ministerial candidate
 iske baavjood jab narendra modi chunaav prachaar ke liye utrenge to muqabla khud-ba-khud modi banaam rahul ho jayega
 After Modi's campaign has made a difference, the pattern has been seen in Gujarat and Karnataka
 bhaajapa kii chunautiyaan, congress kii sahuuliyatbhajapa congress kii aamane-saamne kii takkar main donon dalon ke liye chunautiyaan beshumaar hai
 The Congress is mainly seeing its success in the public's displeasure with the government
 isliye vah madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh ke chunaav prachaar main bhaajapa ke khilaaf chun-chunakar mahangaai or berogari jaise mudde uthaa rahi he, jinase janata pareshaan he
 The BJP has been in power in all the three states for a long time and then it is considered very difficult to win
 congress ko apane paksh main maahaul najar aa rahaa he or party sutara daawa kar rahe hai ki party ko is baar loksabhaa kii 200 siten aaraam se mil jaaengi
 But the Bharatiya Janata Party does not believe so
 party kahati he ki tulana jab hamaare paanch saal or unke 50 saal kii hogi to hamaara palada baari nikalegaa
 BJP leader ve
 L
 narsimharav kaa kahana he ki sidhi takkar vaale rajyon main congress ko nuksaan uthaanaa padegaa
 The issue of inflation is not going to last much
 bhaajapa kii sabase badi takat narendra modi or aakraamak prachaar he jisaki congress netritv main kami dikhti he
 Voters also compare top leaders in direct combat
 sanghathan kii kamajori or simit sansaadhan congress ko bhaajapa ke mukaable kamjor banaate hai
 However, the experience of Sonia Gandhi, who was president for 19 years, will be useful for Rahul Gandhi
 ve bhi prachaar main utrengi or maahaul banaaengi
 BJP president Amit Shah has also left no stone unturned to make equations by taking a stormy tour of the three states
 amit shah teenon chunavi rajyon ke tabadatod daure kar congress se 70 saal kaa hisaab maangate hue bhaajapa kii sarkaron kii uplabdhiyaan gina rahe hai
 He has claimed victory in all three states

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who strongly supported the ban on demonetisation, said on Saturday that the benefits of demonetisation were not given to the people who should have got the benefits due to the role of banks
 unhone kaha ki desh kii pragati main bainkon kii badi bhoomika he

 Earlier, Kejriwal wanted to go to Mayur Vihar's house, but it was disputed

 Since the attack at the Army School in Peshawar, 182 madrasas have been sealed in Pakistan
 in madrason par aatankwaad ko badhaava dene kaa aarope he
 This has been revealed in a media report that came out on Monday
 news agency association press of pakistan(apipi) kii khabar ke mutabik punjab, sindh or khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa main in madrason ko band kiya gaya he kyonki ye kathith taur paraatankwaad ko badhavade rahe the or anya sandigdh gatividhiyon main lipt the
 In December 2014, some militants attacked an army school in Peshawar under the National Action Plan
 is hamale main150 log maare gaye the, jinamein zyaadaatar sankhya bacchon kii thi
 After that the National Action Plan was made and taking action under it, the work of sealing these madrasas started
 bank acount silaatankwaad ko aarthik madad rokane kii ranneeti ke tahat state bank of pakistan(sbp) ne ab tak 126 acount se 1 billian(kareeb 100 karod rupee) jabt kiye hai
 These bank accounts were linked to the banned terrorist organizations
 251 million cash baramadakanoon pravartan agenciyon ne bhi kareeb 251 million cash baraamad kiya he
 The government has registered 1,026 cases and arrested 230 suspected terrorists
 pakistan main 64 sanghathanon par bain tha jabaki UN ne 74 ko gaiyr-kanoonee qaraar diya he
 Organizations under investigation are also under investigation
 jaanch agenciyon in sanghathanon kii harkaton par lagaataar najar banaae hue hai
 1500 books and other items have been seized from around 73 shops, which were full of hate

 In the first phase of Lok Sabha elections, votes will be cast on 8 parliamentary seats of Uttar Pradesh on 11 April
 inamen saharanpur, kairana, mujffarnagar, bijanour, meerut, bagpat, gajiabad or gautamabuddha nagar kii siten shaamil hai
 All these eight Lok Sabha seats of the state are from western Uttar Pradesh
 pehle charan kii siyaasi ladaai bijepi banaam sapa-basapa-areldi gathbandhan ke bich simatati ja rahi he
 In such a situation, it is a big challenge for the Congress to open an account in this period
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main in sabhi aath siton par bijepi ko jeet mili thi
 However, later in 2018, RLD wrested this seat from BJP with the support of BSP and SP in the election held in Kairana Lok Sabha seat
 isi jeet ke formule ko 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main dohraane ke liye sapa-basapa or areldi ne haath milaayaa he
 The Congress, which was sidelined by the alliance, has now entered the electoral arena alone
 congress pehle charan kii aath loksabhaa siton main se congress mahaj 6 siton par chunavi maidan main he
 In Baghpat, Congress has not fielded candidates against Jayant Chaudhary and Muzaffarnagar seat Chaudhary Ajit Singh
 ek tarah se congress ne in donon siton par areldi ko walkover diya he
 In this way, Congress is contesting only three-fourth of the seats in the first phase
 congress ne saharanpur seat se imran masood, kairana se purv saansad harendra malik, bijanour se nasimuddin siddiki, harendra agarwal, gajiabad se doli sharma or gautamabuddha nagar arvind kumaar singh ko maidan main utaara he
 According to political analysts, out of these six Lok Sabha seats, only Saharanpur seat is where the Congress is seen contesting some elections
 lekin basapa ne majboot or muslim ummidavaar haji fajalurrahman ko utaar diya he
 In such a situation, there is a possibility of dividing the Muslim vote between the BSP and the Congress on the Saharanpur seat
 aise hi bijanour loksabhaa seat par congress ne nasimuddin siddiki ko utaara he
 While the bsp's Malook Nagar from the alliance is in the fray
 saharanpur kii tarah bijanour seat par bhi muslim voton ke bantane kii atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai
 The Congress has fielded Babu Banarsi Das's son Harendra Agarwal on the meerut-hapur Lok Sabha seat
 bijepi ne bhi apane do baar ke maujuuda saansad rajendra agarwal ko ek phir ummidavaar banaaya he
 While the alliance bets on Haji Yakub Qureshi
 isse pehle bijepi ummidavaar ke jeet kii mukhya vajah muslim voton ke batnaa mana jaataa he
 This time alone in the electoral fray, BJP and Congress have bet on the Vaishya community
 gajiabad main congress ne brahman ummidavaar ke taur par doli sharma ko utaara he
 There are about two lakh Brahmin voters in this seat
 lekin is seat par kareeb 27 lakh voter hai
 In such a situation, the Brahmin votes do not seem to open the door to victory
 aise hi gautamabuddha nagar seat se congress ne arvind kumaar singh ko utaara he
 While BSP is contesting from Satbir Gurjar and Mahesh Sharma from BJP
 is tarah se trikoniya muqabla mana ja rahaa he, lekin arvind ke liye ye ilaaka nayaa he
 In such a situation, he is facing a lot of problems to make his identity on the Noida parliamentary seat
 dilachasp baat ye he ki pehle charan kii aisi koi bhi seat nahin hai, jahaan mahaj muslim maton se sahare jiti ja sake
 In such a situation, if you look at the political equation, the Muslim candidates of Congress have a big challenge to join their vote bank as well as other votes
 vahi, sapa-basapa-areldi ke votbank ko dekhen to kareeb 50 fisadi ke upar pahunch rahaa he
 In such a situation, if the alliance keeps its vote bank, then the biggest challenge will be for the Congress
 hamen to apano ne lutaa gairon main kahaan dam tha
 This lion fits on Team India precisely because the team's drowners are also players of this team
 or inhen ke lachar pradasharn kii vajah se wo boj bane hue hai
 Let's know who are those players who have become a burden on the Indian team - you tell me what is the fault of Team India
 bas itnaa ki isane apano par bharosa kiya tha
 Just that he expected revenge in his house from his own
 lekin afsos
 Sadly, they all became a burden on the shoulders of their own team
 aaj tak apni pich par ye sirf ek baar haare the
 They had high hopes
 videsh main lagaataar 8 test haar kar aae to chaahane waalon ke saath-saath inkaa bhi dil dukhaa tha
 They found a unique way to take revenge
 jaise ko taisa
 Bouncy's revenge on the turning track
 bade-bade bol bhi bole
 However, he fell into his own pit
 angrejon kii phiraki main hosh aise khoe ki apane kis spinner se kab gendbaaji karaani he, bhul hi gaye
 Let us leave the captaincy, when the turn came to hold the bat, how did the hands tremble
 kehete hai ki uuparavaala boj kam karata he lekin cricket ke bhagwaan par to boj he ki badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Poor God is so buried under this burden that 26 innings did not score a century
 chaliye, dur kii to chhodie, is series kii teen paariyaan hi dekh lijie
 And yes, along with the total deposit runs, the way they get out is interesting
 kareeb 15 maheene baad 15 main jagah mili to laga ki harbhajan singh ilevan main mauka milte hi sari kii sari kasak nikaal denge
 They can complain that the captain held the ball late and got 21 overs in the entire innings
 lekin wo khud se puuchhen ki kya in 21 overon main do gendbaajon kaa shikaar kar wo garv se sir uthaa sakate hai
 If Zaheer Khan feels that it is his ability to get fit and get into the field, then he should be happy
 engladen ke khilaaf 3 pariyon main unhone 119 ran lutaa die or wicket jatke bas 3
 For a long time, the failure of the strike bowler of the losing team on every front of form and fitness is more than these figures
 unka rabip, unki delivery or ummiido kaa kachumar nikaalati unki ye genden team india ke kandhon par boj badhaane ke liye kaaphi hai

 The National People's Party (NPP), contested for the first time in Arunachal Pradesh, has decided to support the BJP in the two parliamentary constituencies and the assembly seats under it
 arunachal pradesh main loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav ke liye matdaan 11 april ko ek saath hoga
 The NPP has fielded 30 candidates for the state elections and one candidate from the Arunachal West parliamentary seat
 enpipi ke pradesh ikai ke adhyaksh gicho kabak ne kaha ki party ne alaakaman ke nirdeshon par arunachal purv sansadeey seat se bhaajapa ummidavaar tapir gaao kaa samarthan karne kaa faisla liya he
 "NPP will support BJP candidates in eastern seats where the party has not fielded candidates," he said
 '' kabak ne saath hi spasht kiya ki party rajya main bhaajapa ke saath chunaav ke baad gathbandhan karne ke liye taiyaar he
 The search for a new president in the party has started after bjp's current president Rajnath Singh was included in Narendra Modi's cabinet as Home Minister
 sutron ke mutabik, is pad ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kareebi sahyogi or aam chunaav main uttar pradesh main bijepi kii shandaar jeet ke karnadhaar rahe amit shah ke naam par bhi charchaa hui

 raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne wing commander abhinandan se shanivaar dopaher mulaakaat kii
 During this, the Defense Minister said that the entire nation is proud of his courage and perseverance
 is dauraan vaayu sena ke varisht adhikari bhi unke saath maujuud the
 According to sources, during the meeting at a medical institute of the Indian Air Force, Abhinandan gave detailed information to the Defense Minister about the stay of Pakistan for about 60 hours
 dhyaan ho ki abhinandan shuukravaar der shaam ataari - wagha seemaa hote hue bharat pahunche or iske kareeb dhai ghante baad raat kareeb paune 12 baje vah vayusena ke ek vimaan se nayi dilli pahunche
 On entering his Indian border, it was found that he had swelling near his right eye
 air force central medical establishment (eexmai) main abhi unki medical jaanch chal rahi he
 Explain that he was caught by Pakistani authorities on 27 February
 darasal, pakistani ladaaku vimaanon ke saath hui ek jhadap ke dauraan unka mig 21 gir gaya tha
 But he shot down the F-16 of the Pakistani Air Force before his plane fell
 vatan vaapasi ke baad abhinandan kii medical jaanch ke baad unhen ab vaayu sena ke hostel main shift kara diya gaya he
 However, it is not yet clear what has come out in Abhinandan's medical report
 darasal, shuukravaar ko pakistan wing commander abhinandan ko bharat ko saunpane vaala tha
 For this, complete preparations had been made by India
 vayusena ke adhikari, bhartiya duutavas ke adhikari or sarkaar ke pratinidhi sabhi samay par taiyaar the, magar pakistan kii chalbaasiyon ne dopaher se raat kar diya
 It was earlier told by Pakistan that he would release Abhinandan between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, but he repeatedly delayed
 iske peeche kai vajahen bataayin ja rahi hai
 For example, he wanted to bring the incident to Lime Light
 vah chahta tha ki puri duniya kii najar is khabar par ho
 Abhinandan was flown from Rawalpindi to Lahore by around 3 pm on Friday evening
 magar lahore se wagha border laane main usne itani der laga di, jisase uske napak iraade bhi sabase saamne jaahir ho gaye
 According to sources, Abhinandan was detained in an army camp located in Lahore and Pakistan forcibly made a video of Abhinandan
 yah baat bhi sahi he ki pakistan or bharat ke bich dastavej kii prakriya main bhi kuch samay kii deree hui thi, magar yah deree itani bhi nahin thi ki abhinandan kii vaapasi main dopaher se raat ho jaae
 According to information received from sources, the delay in handing the Indian pilot Abhinandan to India was because the Pakistani authorities asked him to record the statement on camera
 iske baad hi unhen seemaa paar karke swadesh jane diya gaya
 Apart from this, issues related to documents also became a reason for delay
 sutron ne bataaya tha ki pakistan ne unki rihaai kaa samay do baar taal diya
 Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar Shiv Dular Singh Dhillon told that the brave pilot is happy to return to his country
 yah puche jane par ki abhinandan ne swadesh lautne par adhikariyon se kya kaha, upayukta ne kaha tha ki vah pehle muskuraae or bole, 'main apane desh waapas lautakar khush hum
 He was handed over to BSF officers after some formalities at the Wagah Attari border
 baad main vayusena ke adhikari apane saath abhinandan ko lekar aae
 The wing commander was then taken from the Attari border to Amritsar in an Air Force vehicle
 is dauraan punjab police kii gaadiyaan unke vaahan ke saath chal rahi thim
 After this Vardhman was brought to Delhi by air
 wing commander abhinandan 27 farvari ko subah kareeb das baje pakistani vayusena ke fiter plane kaa peechha karte hue pakistan kii seemaa main ja ghuse the
 Abhinandan's plane also crashed after Pakistan killed the F-16
 is vajah se unhen kisi tarah parachute kii madad se utarana padaa
 When he came down, he did not realize that he had reached the land of enemy country
 kuch log unke paas aae, jinase abhinandan ne poocha ki vah kahaan hai
 On this, some Pakistanis showed tact and told them that you are on the Indian side
 magar abhinandan ko kuch shaq hua
 After this he shouted slogans of Bharat Mata ki Jai
 iske baad phir pakistaniyon ne unhen gher liya
 Abhinandan somehow ran away to save himself
 baad main unhen pakistani sena ne apni hiraasat main le liya
 The army questioned him, but Abhinandan opened his mouth as much as he was allowed to tell in the Air Force
 iske baad unhen pakistani sena ne chaay-coffee bhi pilaai
 Then after the announcement of Imran Khan, the world came to know that he will return to his homeland after just two days
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne abhinandan kii vaapasi kaa swaagat karte hue twit main kaha tha ki ‘wing commander abhinandan aapkaa ghar main swaagat he
 The nation is proud of your indomitable courage
 hamaare sashastr bal desh ke 130 karod bharatiyon ke liye prerana kaa strot hai

 This answer given by the soldiers of the Indian Army was so drastic that there is a stir in Pakistan now
 bharat kii javaabi karrwai main kareeb aadha darjan pakistani sena ke jawan maare gaye hai, 3 aatanki camp tabah hue hai or aatanki bhi maare gaye hai
 Meanwhile, an attempt is being made by Pakistan to hide this truth, which also includes the Pakistan Army and the media
 pakistan sena ne bharat ke daavon ko kiya khaarijbharat kii ore se pakistan main tabaahi machaa di gai he, lagaataar aatanki camp par nishaanaa or un aatankiyon kii aad ban rahe pakistani sena ke javaanon ko bhi karaara jawaab dena

 ise padhein:pok main phir kahar banakar tutaa bharat, darjanon aatanki dher, camp bane nishaanaa, PAK bolaa
 
 
 Asif Gafoor is continuously claiming that the terrorist camps that India is talking about are destroyed, it is wrong
 unhone likhaa he kisifokh main aise koi camp the hi nahin, itnaa hi nahin unhone phir videshi media ko checking karne ke liye nyotaa diya he
 The Pakistani military is supporting the Pakistani army and is constantly spreading lies against India, so the media there is also supporting it
 sena pramukh bipin ravat ne bataaya he ki bharat ke ection main 5-6 pakistani sena ke jawan maare gaye hai
 But Pakistan media is hiding this truth and continuously claiming that there is a lot of destruction in Pakistan's action
 pakistani media kai bhartiya javaanon ke maare jane kii baat kar rahaa he, jo ki saraasar galat he
 The propensity of false claims by senior Indian military leadership especially since Pulwama incident is detrimental to peace in the region
 Such false claims by Indian Army are being made to suit vested domestic interests
 This is against professional military ethos

 IRCTC has been given this responsibility in its place
 dilli main somvaar ko rail mantri suresh prabhu ne bhartiya rail main nai cataring policy ko lagu karne kaa elaan kiya
 The Railway Minister proposed this in his Rail Budget speech last year
 suresh prabhu ne kaha, 'ham rail yatriyon ko acha, saaf suthra khaanaa muhaiyaa karana chaahate hai
 We want them to be served delicious and nutritious food in moving trains
 ' relon kaa khanpan behatar karne ke liye rail mantralay kii kai yojanaayen hai jinke anusaar rail ke kichan ko aadhunik shakl di jaaegi
 The work of cooking and delivering food will be done separately
 dhire-dhire chalati trainon main khaanaa pakaane kaa kaam band ho saktaa he
 Instead, food will be cooked at different stations which will go in trains
 mantralay kaa maananaa he ki nai cataring policy se ek ore jahaan thekedaaron kii manamaani khatm hogi to vahiin duusari ore khanpan bhi behatar hoga
 After increasing questions and complaints about the quality of food in moving trains, the Railway Minister now wants to provide clean and better nutritious food to the passengers through the new catering policy

 It will operate a catering service keeping cooking and its distribution separate

 saamaajik uddeshy ko hasil karne ke makasad se is niti ke tahat stall ke aavanton main mahilaon ko 33 fisadi kaa up kota diya jayega
 The Ministry believes that while the new catering policy will eliminate the arbitrariness of contractors, on the other hand, catering will also be better
 chalati trainon main khaane kii gunvattta ko lekar badhate sawaalon or shikayaton ke baad ab rail mantri nai cataring policy ke zariye yatriyon ko saaf-suthra or behatar paushtik khaanaa muhaiyaa karana chaahate hai
 Now the next challenge will be to implement this new catering system effectively
 tippaniyan The new policy giving IRCTC the responsibility of catering in most trains is being replaced by the seven year old policy
 saal, 2010 main mamata banerjee ke rail mantri rahete hue iarsitisi ko katering kii jimmedaari se mukt kar diya gaya tha
 Prabhu had said in the 2016 budget, 'IRCTC will start handling the catering service in a phased manner
 yah khaanaa pakaane or iske vitaran ko alag alag rakhte hue katering seva sanchalit karegi
 ' railway katering niti-2017 iarsitisi ko khaane kaa menu tay karne or iske liye raashi nirdhaarit karne kaa adhikaar hoga, haalanki iske liye use railway board se paraamarsh lenaa hoga
 In order to achieve the social objective, women will be given a sub quota of 33 per cent in the allocation of stalls under this policy

 On this day one can benefit by worshiping the Panchmukhi form of Hanuman

e
 Bhadrakali Ekadashi
 puraanon main is din kii badi manyata he
 It is said that when Hanuman, caught in a dilemma between the orders of his deity Lord Rama and Mata Anjani, took Panchamukhi form to protect a devotee, that day was also Bhadrakali Ekadashi
 is baar to ye ekadshi mahavir ke priy din mangalvaar ko padi he jo is din ko or adhik faldaayi bana rahi he
 It is said that once Lord Rama invited all the kings to his meeting
 kaashi naresh vikramaditya bhi is sabha main shaamil hone nikal pade
 On the way Vikramaditya met the god Rishi Narada
 naarad muni se kaashi naresh se kaha ki aap bhagwaan ram kii sabha main jaakar sabhi kaa abhinandan karen sivaay vishwamitra ke
 On hearing this, Narad Muni, the King of Kashi got worried and said that Vishwamitra would be angry with this
 naarad muni ne vikramaditya ko is baat kii chintaa karne se manaa kiya
 The King of Kashi reached the assembly of Lord Rama and did as he was told by Narada Muni
 raja ke is vyavhaar se vishwamitra bahut dukhi hue or bhagwaan ram se kaashi naresh kaa vadh karne ko kaha
 On hearing this, the King Naresh reached Narada Muni
 naarad muni ne raja ko mata anjani kii sharan main jane ko kaha
 The king approached Mata Anjani and requested to protect his life
 raja kii baat sunakar mata anjani ne hanuman se raja kii raksha karne ko kaha
 This was a big dilemma for Hanuman because on one side his adorable Lord Rama and on the other hand had to obey the orders of Mata Anjani
 tab hanuman vikramaditya ko samudr ke bichon-bich ek dweep par le gaye or ram naam japane ko kaha
 When Rama arrived to slaughter, seeing the king chanting Rama's name, he could not kill him and asked the king about his protector
 vikramaditya ne bhagwaan ram ko hanuman kaa naam bataaya or tabhi hanuman panchmukhi rup main prakat hue
 Since then, the glory of Hanuman's Panchmukhi form has spread far and wide

 par 48 ghante lambey chale dharne ke jariye mamata ne dotuk sandesh de diya he—ve modi virdohi gathbandhan kii aguai karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 In fact, the Chief Minister of West Bengal was instigated for this political roar and exhibition by a team of CBI, who got Rs 12,000 crore from Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajiv Kumar on the night of 3 February
 ke sharada chit fund ghotaale main poochtacha karne ke liye unke awaas par ja dhamkee thi
 The CBI alleged that Rajiv was not helping in the investigation and had tampered with the evidence
 apane police kamisionar ko bachaane ke liye mamata ke paas or bhi bahut-se tareeke the, par unke bheetar ke chaalaak siyasatdan ne is sankat main chhipe zyada bade siyaasi maukey ko tad liya
 She had been silent even before the arrest of several top leaders of her party's Trinamool Congress, but when the CBI targeted her most talented police officer, she also gave a political message by invading counter-attack
 sadak par utarkar ladgaye ke jazbe ke liye vikhyath mamata ne protocol or shishtacharon ko taak par rakh diya, apni gaadi main savaar hokar sidhe kamisionar ke sarkari awaas pahunchin, phir rajeev ke daravaaje par aae sibiai adhikariyon ko police afasaron se kahkar hiraasat main dalwaaya or usee din rajeev ke saath dharne par baith gayi
 Mamata, who had been playing a legal hideout between the CBI and Kolkata Police for a long time, turned her into a fight between a 'totalitarian center' and her victim, West Bengal
 di ko nishaanaa banane ke liye mamata ne aisa mudda chunaa, jise tamaam vipakshi partiyon ne hatho-haath liya or tatkaal samarthan diya
 Even Rahul Gandhi and Mayawati, who are his closest rivals and seekers for the Prime Minister's chair, came forward to show solidarity and promised to fight 'shoulder to shoulder' with him
 rajd ke tejasvi yadav or dramuk kii kanimoli unase milane ke liye dharna manch par ain
 The shiv-sena also — in the party mouthpiece Saamana — said that the CBI raid was planned by the BJP with the intention of 'winning 10 to 15 seats'
 vah 'baraabar kii takat se centre par palatakar waar karne' ke liye mamata ke kaside kadhati bhi dikhaai di
 Even the BJD chief and Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, who showed no interest in the Grand Alliance of the Opposition, was seen adding to the tone of his suffering born out of the CBI action, when he said that "the integrity of the CBI as an institution" Have to be restored "
 haalanki baad main ek ehtiyaati bayaan main bijedy ne kaha ki ''is bayaan kii vajah se bijedy ko kuch siyaasi partiyon ke saath jodpha galat he"
 Finally, on 5 February, when the Supreme Court instructed the CBI that she could not arrest Rajiv, Mamata withdrew the dharna, although the apex court also instructed Rajiv to investigate in the 'neutral' city of Shillong for questioning

 magar tab tak mamata apane makasad main kaamyaab ho chuki thim or yah makasad khud ko ek aise netaa ke taur par pesh karnaa tha jo modi-shah kii takat kaa muqabla kar saktaa he or vipaksh kii anek siyaasi partiyon kaa samarthan juta saktaa he
 She said, "I will ask all political parties to work together to remove BJP
" " unhone yah bhi kaha ki modi ne unke khilaaf 'sanvaidhanik takhtapalat' kii yojana banaai thi, sirf isliye ki unhone 19 janvari ko united india raily kaa aayojan kiya tha or usamen kai vipakshi netaa manch saajha karne ke liye kolkata aae the
 On 5 February, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N
 chandrababu naidu unke saath khadey the
 The reason for the growing disputes between Mamata and the BJP is the ambition of the BJP, due to which it is eager to perform strong in the state in the coming elections
 bhaajapa pashchim bengal kii 42 siton main se kam se kam 10 jeetne kii aas lagaae he
 The center of the saffron party's mission to establish itself in the east is West Bengal and it now needs even more to gain a foothold in the east because three states of the Hindi belt have lost its hand in the December assembly elections
 uttar pradesh main bhi jahaan bhaajapa ne 80 main se 71 siton par fatah hasil kii thi, party ko ab sapa-basapa gathjod kii taraf se kadi chunauti kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 This is the reason that Bengal has become a very important battlefield for the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections
 2014 ke chunaav main usne yahaan 2 siten or 17 fisad vot hasil kiye the, magar 2016 main mukhya rup se vam dalon or congress ke saath milakar ladgaye kii vajah se uskaa vot share ghatakar 10 fisadi par aa gaya tha
 Mamta is not ready to step back an inch whether it is the issue of demonetisation or the Goods and Services Tax or the proposed Democracy Save Rath Yatra
 mamata rajya main bhaajapa ko khuli chhot katai nahin dena chaahatin
 By not allowing the BJP leaders to land helicopters on government helipads and laying down roadblocks in the way of their political rallies, they have demonstrated their most fighting attitude
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko dakshin deenajpur, uttar deenajpur or bankuda main reliyaan karne se roak diya gaya tha, uske baad ve jharkhand main utarkar 28 kimi sadak se safar karke purulia aa sake
 However, Mamta insists that she did nothing out of the box
 unhone daawa kiya, ''modi yahaan aae, rajnath singh ne chah reliyaan kin or yahaan tak ki ve (shah) bhi swine kralu ke saath yahaan aae
 "the BJP leadership is not at all disappointed by Mamata's sit-in
 usne isamen ek mauka bhaanp liya he
 It can project its 2019 campaign as a fight between 'honest Modi' and 'corrupt alliance'
 yahaan tak ki yah modi ko apana khub aajamaaya hua peedit shaks kaa card khilne kaa mauka bhi detaa he, jisamen ve tafasil se gina sakate hai ki 2008 or 2014 ke bich vibhinn maamalon main tatkaaleen upie sarkaar ne kis tarah siyaasi badale kii bhaavana se unhen or shah ko pareshaan kiya tha
 The Prime Minister pointed out the question in a sincere language and style, saying, "while in power, we have always promised the Constitution and the system
 didi, agar aapane kuch galat nahin kiya he to darane vaali koun-si baat he? jab main gujarat kaa mukhyamantri tha tab sibiai ne mujhase bhi to nau ghanton tak poochtacha kii thi, par main is agnipariksha se gujara
 Why didi feel that they are above the law
 "bhaajapa ke rashtriya media samanvayak amit malviya ke mutabik, mamata ne unase kahin zyada vipaksh ke gathbandhan ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 He says, 'opposition is trapped by Mamata's support
 congress munh dikhaane laayak nahin rahi kyonki isi ghotaale ke liye vah pehle mamata ko aade haath le chuki thi
 It is clear that this is a fight between clean Modi and the alliance
 "bhaajapa adhyaksh shah kii 22 janvari ko malda main hui raily or durgapur main 2 farvari ko modi kii sabha ke baad se hi mamata bhaajapa par palatwaar karne ke makul maukey kii taak main thim
 Both top BJP leaders were viciously attacking Mamata over allegations of involvement in two big chit fund scams - Sarada and Rose Valley
 donon ponji companiyaan 2013 main dhwast ho gayi or sibiai inaki jaanch kar rahi he
 Many leaders of all parties are feared trapped in the investigation but most of them are from Trinamool

 The CBI also cited former Union Minister P

 The investigating agency also interrogated Mukul Roy, who had jumped from Trinamool to BJP in 2016
 sibiai ne assam ke vitt mantri hemanth biswa sarama se bhi poochtacha kii thi jo 2015 main hi congress se bhaajapa kii sharan main aa gaye the
 On January 24, CBI detained filmmaker Shrikant Mohta, considered close to Mamta, in connection with the Rose Valley scam
 jaanch agency ne aarope lagaaya ki mohataa ne roj vaili ke mukhiya gautam kundu se 25 karod ru
 Were taken kundu philhal jail main hai
 Five paintings of Mamta were also found from him
 apni reliyon main shah chit fund ghotaalon main mamata banerjee kii sidhi bhagidhaari kaa aarope lagaate rahe hai
 It is common discussion that the names of some prominent leaders are likely to appear in the final charge sheet of the Saradha scam
 ye naam loksabhaa chunaav se pehle ujagar ho jaaenge
 In a sting operation called the Narada scam, several TMC leaders were seen demanding cash in exchange for help
 isamen tiemasi ke nau saansad or paanch mantri rishwatakhori ke aarope jhel rahe hai
 Given all this, it should not be surprising that in 2018 the West Bengal government backtracked with the general consensus to conduct a CBI raid and investigation in the state, saying that "the central government of the central government of the Narendra Modi government These institutions have lost their faith due to misuse
 "agency ke afasaron kaa daawa he ki rajeev ko kai notice bheje gaye the, lekin unhone koi jawaab nahin diya
 So he was forced to take such a step
 2015 or 2017 main sibiai ne rajya police par jaanch main sahyog na karne kaa aarope lagaate hue supreme court main yachika daayar kii thi
 The CBI also sought permission from the state government to hand over three police officers, including Rajiv, in August 2018, to speed up the investigation
 inamen se do ko 13 farvari tak ucch nyaayalay se sthagan aadesh mil gaya tha, lekin rajeev usamen shaamil nahin the
 The CBI is a national agency with police-like powers
 iskaa praathmik kshetradhikaar dilli or centre shasit pradeshon tak hi simit he
 The CBI got this strength from the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act
 grih mantralay ne ek prastaav ke madhyam se april 1963 main is agency kii sthapana multah bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii jaanch ke liye kii thi
 Under Section 5 of the Act, the Central Government may extend its powers and jurisdiction to investigate specified offenses
 haalanki, is shakti par dhara 6 kaa shikanja bhi he, jo kahati he ki sibiai kii shaktiyon or adhikaar kshetra ko sambandhit rajya sarkaar kii sahmati ke bina badhaayaa nahin ja saktaa
 There are many instances of state governments withdrawing their consent to the CBI probe
 masalan sikkim ko hi len
 When the CBI registered a case against the then Chief Minister Nar Bahadur Bhandari, the state withdrew its consent
 haalanki, 2010 main supreme court ne tatkaaleen makapa netritv vaali pashchim bengal sarkaar kii ek apil, jisamen makapa haai court ke sibiai jaanch ke aadesh main chhot paanaa chaahati thi, kii pratikriya main kaha tha ki haai court rajya sarkaron kii sahmati ke bina sibiai ko maamalon kii jaanch karne kaa nirdesh de saktaa he
 Interestingly, the root of this decision lies in Mamta's TMC
 kalakatta haai court ne sibiai ko 2001 main midanapur main hui golibari kii ghatnaon ko jaanch kaa aadesh diya tha
 Many TMC workers were killed in this shootout
 makapa kii apil usee maamle main thi
 In May 2014, the Supreme Court handed over the investigation of crores of Saradha scam to CBI
 court ne kaha tha ki rajya police ghotaale kii jaanch main koi pragati nahin dikhaa paa rahi
 Neither she is able to find the angles of the conspiracy, nor is searching for the money in the scandal, nor is it able to trace and seize the assets related to the scam
 sibiai ke anusaar, rajya ne april 2013 main sharada chit fund ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye rajeev kii adhyakshata main gathit vishesh jaanch dal (esaity) banaaya
 He has not yet found evidence of this
 isamen ek laptop, paanch cellphone or kuch dastavej jisamen sharada group ke pramotor sudipt sen, rajeev kii diary bhi shaamil hai, sibiai ko nahin saunpe gaye
 TMC claimed that the CBI was targeting and targeting its leaders, while it was not investigating Roy and Sarma after joining the BJP
 5 farvari ko mamata ne yahaan tak daawa kiya ki sarama ke khilaaf unke paas paryaapt saboot the or unhone modi or shah ko chunauti di ki ve sarama ko giraftaar karne kaa saahas dikhaaen
 Sarma denied the charge and said that he had participated in the investigation as a mere witness and the CBI had already examined him
 ve kehete hai, ''bhaajapa main shaamil hone se bahut pehle meri jaanch puri ho chuki thi
 "mamta has achieved what she wanted while Rajiv is in more trouble
 grih mantralay ne rajya sarkaar se kaha he ki vah ''anushaasanheen vyavhaar or akhil bhartiya seva aacharan niyamon ke ulanghan" ke tahat rajeev ke khilaaf anushaasanamak karrwai shuru kare
 The Ministry has clearly stated that Rajiv, sitting with some police officers in the Chief Minister's dharna, has violated the All India Service Rules 1969
 pashchim bengal rajya ke bhaajapa adhyaksh dilip ghosh kehete hai, "police kamisionar ke paas koi sharmnaak raaj he jise mukhyamantri chhipaana chaahati hai?"bataate hai, rajeev ne sibiai ko likhaa he ki ve 8 farvari ko prastut honge
 Mamta has promised the CBI officers good behavior that they will be fed Rasgulla and Mishti Doi with delicious Bengali cuisine

 Gavaskar, however, has no objection to two members of the IPL Governing Council being part of the investigation

 It is unfair to doubt his integrity only because he is going to investigate the Gurunath issue

 desh main pehali baar bhartiya janata party ne kisi rajya main sattarudh vampanthi sarkaar ko na sirf chunauti di balki use karaari shikast dekar satta se baahar bhi kar diya
 This victory of BJP in Tripura has many meanings for it
 mahaj do saal kii mehnat ke saath bijepi ne vah kar dikhaaya jo congress 2 dashakon se adhik samay se karne kii koshish main thi
 This victory of the BJP in Tripura is also important because it did not give the Congress a chance to open its account in the state along with defeating the Left Party
 bijepi ke is pradarshan ke baad ab mahaj kerala main left party kii sarkaar bachi he
 Here too the Congress is constantly trying to get the Left out of power, but now after the results of Tripura, can BJP be considered more effective in ridding the Left of politics in this state? Mamta had dropped the Left in West Bengal Before the fort, the work of penetrating the left fort was done by Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress in West Bengal
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main tiemasi or congress ke gathbandhan vaali upie ne pehali baar paanch dashakon se sabase adhik siten jeetne vaali vamadalon ko shikast di
 However, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, TMC stood at the forefront leaving the Congress behind
 ise padhein: tripura main dhah gaya left kaa kila
 
 
 Learn how the magic of the BJP went on, but the real task of demolishing the Left Fort was done in the 2011 assembly elections when Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress was overthrown in the state since 1977
 iske baad ek baar phir 2016 main mamata ne rajya main vampanthi dalon ke saath-saath congress or bijepi ko shikast dekar is vam kile ko apane naam kar liya
 Now in the BJP vs Left in Kerala, CPI (M) General Secretary s Sudhakar Reddy has claimed that BJP is the number one enemy for his party, amid the possibility of a defeat at the hands of the BJP in Tripura
 reddy ne daleel di ki bijepi ke badhate prabhaav ko dekhte hue left partiyon ko apni ranneeti badalane kii jarurat he
 According to Reddy, to defeat the BJP, it is necessary to join a larger platform
 lihaaja bina naam liye ishaara kiya ki bijepi kaa muqabla karne ke liye ab vamadalon ko congress kaa daaman pakadaney ke vikalp par sochna chahie
 However, before this, the statement of Reddy, which speculated the alliance of Left and Congress, was clarified as not being seen as increasing proximity to Congress in the fight against BJP
 yah safai kerala ke mukhyamantri pinarai vijayan ne di
 Vijayan said that there is no possibility of any alliance with Congress in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 gauratlab he ki tripura chunaavon se pehle vampanthi netaa seetaram yechuri ne bhi yahi daawa kiya tha
 Yechury had said that the biggest enemy of the left parties is the BJP and to defeat it it is necessary to support the Congress
 yechuri ke is bayaan kaa tripura samet kerala ke vampanthi netaaon ne jamkar virodh kiya tha
 Party units in both states claimed that they would be able to save the left fort in both states on their own
 donon rajyon main left partiyaan kaa maananaa he ki congress se kisi tarah kaa gathbandhan unke liye nitigat taur par galat sabit hoga
 However, the results of Tripura have given a reply to the Left parties in the state
 yadi unhone yechuri kii baat ko maanate hue congress ke saath gathbandhan kaa prayaas kiya hota to sambhavat: rajya main nattejey kuch or hote
 Now it remains to be seen whether Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in Kerala learns any lesson from the party's defeat in Tripura? Or he will also write the last script of Left vs

 The sensation spread in Saurabh Vihar area of jaitpur in South East Delhi when a gas cylinder exploded due to fire

 According to the family members, on Monday, they had this new gas cylinder, in which they had also complained of leakage, but before that it was a terrible accident

 After the accident, the fire brigade reached the spot completely controlled the fire, but by the time everything was burnt down
 ek choti si laaparvaahee kii vajah se ye bada haadasa ho gaya, haadase ke baad puure ilaake main dehshat kaa maahaul he
 Police is currently investigating the entire case

 Hence, high-profile encounters of Narendra Modi and Arvind Kejriwal are also being enjoyed through poems
 kavigan apni panktiyon ke jariye raajnneetik vyavastha par vyangy kar rahe hai
 The atmosphere is such that the poetry of the poets is adorned at the Darbhanga Ghat in Varanasi
 ganga kinare na sirf vartmaan raajnneeti par charchaa ho rahi he balki kataaksh bhi kiye ja rahe hai
 Some are looking for hope in Modi and others are looking for Ajay rai
politics is being discussed in a fun way in chaay kii dukaan par paan kii sangat main raajnneeti par mjedaar tareeke se baatcheet ho rahi he
 Humorist Dazzle Gyanpuri starts his poem from here, 'kejriwal ji came to Benaras, got tomatoes and eggs in welcome

 ' pashchim bengal main matdaan ke duusare charan se pehle trinmul congress ke ek sthaneey netaa kii shuukravaar raat hatya kar di gai he
 The family of Jaydev Jana, the deceased after the murder in West Midnapore district of the state, has described it as political violence
 saath hi is hatya ke peeche rajya ke purv congress pramukh maanas bhuniya or unke bhai bikaas samet 23 logon kaa haath bataaya he
 It is being told that Jana was returning from an election rally when some people attacked him with iron bars and bamboo sticks
 congress netaaon ne is maamle ko raajnneetik rang die jane kaa aarope lagaaya he or kaha he ki unke kaaryakartaaon kaa is vaardaat se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has demanded intervention from the Election Commission
 police ne kaha he ki maamle kii jaanch ho rahi he lekin abhi tak is maamle main kisi ko giraftaar nahin kiya gaya he
 Congress leaders have accused the case of giving political color and said that their activists have nothing to do with the incident

 The police has said that the matter is under investigation but so far no one has been arrested in this case
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 30 june kii madhyaratri sansad ke central haul se deshbhar main jiesti lagu karte vakt elaan kiya ki 1 july se ganganagar se itanagar or leh se lakkshadweep tak desh main sabhi saamaan ek daam par bikenge
 But but this is not true
 desh main car, motorcycle samet sabhi gaadiyaan ek daam par nahin bechi ja sakati hai
 This is because in all the states the sale of cars is done at the on road price and even after the implementation of GST, there has been no change in this system
 aap jab desh ke kisi rajya main car, motorcycle samet koi gaadi kharidte hai to showrooms par aapako do keemat bataai jaati he
 One ex showroom and the other on road price
 aap ko gaadi kharidne par on road price adaa karnaa hota he, lihaaja jaaniye kaise eksshorooms priceke baad on road price nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 What is x factory price? x factory price is the price that a car dealer pays to the manufacturer to pick up the car from the factory
 yani vah keemat jisapar car company apane dealer ko car bechati he
 What is the ex-showroom price? In the country, vehicles are sold by adding road tax to the price of the car (ex-factory price)
 yahrod texrajya sarkaar kii kar suchi main aata he or ise puri tarah se jiesti ke daayre se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 After adding road tax, the price of the car varies from 5 to 15 percent in different states
 isi eks showrooms price ke chalate rajyon main gaadi kii keemat alag-alag rahati he
 Due to this, vehicles are sold at the cheapest rates in states like Rajasthan and Haryana
 gauratlab he ki road tex jiesti ke daayre main nahin he
 Hence, the selling price of vehicles still varies from state to state
 aise main pradhanmantri kaa sansad main elaan ki desh ke har kone main utpaada ek hi daam par bikenge, kam se kam gadiyon kii bikri ke maamle par lagu nahin hota
 Union Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Jyotiraditya Scindia has said that BJP has no moral right to accuse Congress on the issue of corruption
 sindhiya ne samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main kaha ki bhrashtachar ko lekar bhaajapa ko congress ke khilaaf bolne kaa naitik adhikaar nahin he
 He said that when many senior BJP leaders, including former president Bangaru Laxman, Dilip Singh Judeo and now former Karnataka chief ministers BS Yeddyurappa and Reddy brothers, are surrounded by allegations of corruption, with what face is he on the Congress May accuse of corruption
 sindhiya ne kaha ki bhrashtachar ke mudde par yatra nikaalane kii bajaae laalkrishna adwani ko apana ghar sudhaarney par dhyaan dena chahie
 He said that as far as the Congress is concerned, it is curbing corruption by bringing many effective laws including good governance and Lokpal
 unhone bhaajapa kii rajya sarkaar par purv main shuru hui kai pariyojnaon ko puraa karne main anaavashyak rup se vilamb karne kaa aarope bhi lagaaya

 5 acre jameen ek saath di thi jo ganga-jamuni tahjeeb ke pratik ke taur par khadaa he
 What is the history of Aishbagh's Ramlila? It is believed that Ramlila first started about five hundred years ago when Goswami Tulsidas together laid its foundation in Chitrakoot, Varanasi and Lucknow
