 Credit is on ek taraf shahrukh khan hai to duusari taraf nirdeshak sanjay lila bhansaali
 The two are once again face to face at the box office and are challenging each other, as on December 18, Shah Rukh is releasing his film 'dilwale' and Sanjay Leela Bhansali together with his film 'baji Rao Mastani'
 zaahir he ki donon ke liye chunauti badi he
 In such a situation, both have to take possession of more and more cinema houses and release their films
 agar abhi ke rujhaan kii taraf dekhen to film 'dilavaale' badhat bana rahi he or use zyaada cinema ghar mil rahe hai
 It is being told that 'dilwale' is getting around 2000 to 2500 screens
 vahiin, duusari taraf 'baaji raav mastaani' ko qareeb 1800 se 2000 screen ab tak mili hai
 According to the news, 'baji Rao Mastani' has more number of single screens and 'dilwale' has occupied more multiplex screens
 haalanki ye bhi kaha ja rahaa he cinema gharon ke is bantwaare main thode or ulat pher ho sakate hai
 The comments is desh main badi se badi filmein ek baar main 5000 se 5500 screens tak main release kii jaati hai or ab tak kii sabase badi release is diwaali par pradarshit hui salmaan khan kii film 'prem ratan dhan payo' ko mili he jo kareeb 5500 screens par release hui thi
 That is, the number of screens across the country is only between 5000 and 5500
 aise main agar 2 badi filmein ek saath aaengi to exibitars or distributors ke liye cinema gharon kaa bantwaaraa karnaa mushkil hoga or jab screens bantenge to collection bhi do hisson main bantega yani donon filmon kaa kuch na kuch nuksaan hoga
 But without worrying about these losses, Shahrukh and Sanjay Leela Bhansali are ready to face each other
 ladaai dilachasp hogi, kyonki saal 2007 main sanjay lila bhansaali kii haar ho chuki he, jab shahrukh kii film 'om shanti om' ke saamne sanjay lila bhansaali kii film 'saanwariyaa' flop hui thi
 Perhaps Sanjay Leela Bhansali is ready to take revenge on Shahrukh this time, because the promo of 'baji Rao Mastani' is being highly appreciated

 magar in nuksaanon kii chintaa kiye bina shahrukh or sanjay lila bhansaali ek duusare ke aamane-saamne hone ko taiyaar hai
 The fight will be interesting, as Sanjay Leela Bhansali has lost in 2007, when Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Saawariya flopped in front of Shahrukh's film 'om Shanti Om'
 shaayad sanjay lila bhansaali is baar shahrukh se badla lene ke liye taiyaar hai, kyonki ' baaji raav mastaani' ke promo kii jamkar saraahna ho rahi he

 The immediate reason for Jaswant's break-up with BJP was the decision to give the ticket from Barmer to Colonel Sona Ram Chaudhary, who broke away from the Congress
 isse pehle 2009 main bhi jaswant ne apni kitaab main desh ke bantwaare ko lekar sardaar patel kii bhoomika par tippanee kii to unhen party se baahar kaa darwaja dikhaa diya gaya tha
 He says that the reason for his rebellion now is the culture of dictatorship and sycophancy in the party
 chaay kii chuskee lete hue unke haath kaanpate hai lekin unki aawaaj main vahi bulandi he or ladaai main date rahane kaa jajba he
 In 2010, he rejoined BJP due to the efforts of then party president Nitin Gadkari
 lekin is baar vaapasi kii koi raah nahin he
 Excerpts from his conversation with Deputy Editor Sandeep Unnithan: The BJP that you have been associated with for 34 years is changing now? The party has slowly started on a dictatorial path in the last two-three years
 bijepi loktantric, salaah-mashvire vaali, rajnatik vichaardhaara or rajnatik sanghathan kii party hua karti thi
 In my opinion, after Vajpayee and Advani, the place of discussion, disagreement and divergent views in the party is over
 (endie) cabinet vaaki loktantric thi
 i used to have serious arguments and disagreements with Prime Minister Vajpayee himself
 ye kisi asahmatiyaan thim?nitigat masalon par
 There were always talks and some things had to be left out, some had to be accepted
 ab har baatcheet bich main hi khatm ho jaati he, jiskaa ki party ke liye koi phayda nahin he
 What about the Namo slogan to which you objected? 'namo, Namo' has a religious resonance
 aap netritv ko vyakti puja main kaise tabdeel kar sakate hai? gandhi to kisi rajnatik pad par nahin the, phir bhi unhone desh ke bantwaare par baatcheet kii or yah hakeekat he
 My book on Jinnah analyzes the most important and heavy upheaval events of the 20th century
 us par congress party ne prastaav pesh kiya
 The proposal of Pandit Nehru was approved by Sardar Patel and Gandhi was present there
 jaiprakash narayan or ram manohar lohia jaise kai logon ne is faisle kaa virodh kiya tha
 Why am i giving this example? Such a big event, the partition of my country
 
 
 nehru or patel ne prastaav rakhaa
 
 
 He was opposed
 
 
 ise vot ke liye rakhaa gaya or prastaav gir gaya
 After that, the motion was passed by Gandhi's intervention
 yah loktantric dhang se kaam karne ke tareeke kii misaal he
 Meaning the atmosphere of intolerance in BJP was born in 2009? It started long ago
 immergency ke elaan ne kai sansthaaon ko nasht kar diya
 Our democratic spirit was damaged and (d
 ke
 ) Barua even went on to say that "india is Indira and Indira is India" (india is Indira and Indira is India)
 ” yah desh main faili chatukaarita kaa shuruaati udhaaharan he
 In my opinion the chanting of 'namo Namo' is also an example of that trend
 immergency ne desh kaa bhav badal diya or hamen jhooth or naklipan kii raah par dhakel diya
 Is there any internal emergency in BJP? Yes
 rajnath singh ne twit main 'bijepi’ kii jagah 'modi’ likhaa he
 These are absurd things related to someone's behavior
 main kisi vyakti par tippanee nahin karnaa chahta
 
 
 But i do not want to say
 vaaki main kuch aisa kathor kahuunga jo main bilkul kahana nahin chahta
 Has the BJP president tried to contact you? (laughs) Have not
 yah aashcharya kaa vishay he ki kyon unhone mujhe party se paanch saal main do baar nikaalane ke liye adhyaksh ke pad kaa istemaal kiya
 i do not want to tell how much i helped them when they came to the center for the first time
 
 
 chalo vah to thik he
 
 
 i do not think there is any room for gratitude in the BJP or any political party
 mujh se kaha gaya ki main up-raashtrapati pad kaa chunaav laduun kyonki party kaa maananaa tha ki mere main chunaav jeetne kaa dam nahin he
 
 
 The Chief Minister also explained the reason 
 
 
 They are not Rajasthani, their nature is also not Rajasthani
 
 
 
 She does not know the language, culture and ethos of this region
 meri patni thane main shikaayat darj karaane gayi (ek calendar main vasundhara raaje ko devi ke rup main chitrit karne ke khilaaf) lekin police ne exiar darj nahin kii
 My book was banned in Gujarat, i was expelled from the BJP and the person who is the president today told me over the telephone, "AAP is expelled from the party
 ” uske baad unhone sawarjanik rup se kaha, agar aap ek bhi shabd jinna ke paksh main bole (adhuraa chhod dete hai)
 
 
 Jinnah divided our country with Nehru and Patel! If they had not agreed, our country would not have been divided
 yahi hakeekat he
 You believe that a different kind of myth about Patel is being created? Absolutely
 aap vaikalpik myth kyon gadhia chaahate hai? hakeekat to ekadam alag he
 Like Pakistan
 pakistan kii to neenv hi jhooth par rakhi gai he
 Now we also want to become a second-rate Pakistan by creating a completely mythical history
 aakhir kis liye?aapako up-raashtrapati pad ke liye chunaav ladaane kii peshkash kisne kii thi?bijepi ke kendriya netritv ne
 i don't want to say all that
 mujhe shreshth saansad bhi kaha gaya
 Hopefully! The country wakes up and realizes the danger arising inside itself
 bijepi adhyaksh ek party sadsy ke liye garv se ghoshnaa karte hai, ''main inke peeche chattïna kii tarah khadaa hum
 "what the hell is this?" When you start worshiping a person, you leave the people aside, but people are the essence of democracy
 asahmati loktantr kaa hissaa hoti he
 How do you see BJP in the current era? In my opinion, today there is more democratic communist CPI (M) than BJP
 yah vidambnaa he
 Your opponents would say that if Barmer could have got a ticket then everything was fine
 nahin
 Even then i would keep my opinion
 main kyon barmer se laduya chahta tha? maine 1989 main bhaironsingh shekhavat se kaha tha ki mujhe barmer se ladgaye dijie
 He said, "no, you have to fight with Jodhpur
 ” phir chittod bheja gaya
 
 
 In this way i was kept away from Barmer
 phir mujhase darjeeling se ladgaye ko kaha gaya
 Gorkha Mukti Morcha said after taking my name
 ab aap mujhase kah rahe ho ki agar mujhe apane ghar se ladgaye kii ijaajat de di gai hoti to main yah sab nahin kahata, jo kah rahaa hum
 You want to say that my opposition is on small talk
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki aapane unase barmer ke liye kabhi baat hi nahin kii
 She is speaking wrong
 yah kahana hi apmanjanak he kyonki unke mukhyamantri banaae jane ke peeche ek itihaas he or maine usamen bhoomika adaa kii thi
 
 
 
 kya unamem mujhase poochne kaa shishtachar he? maine unase aisi maang nahin kii
 i talked to him and to him
 kya aapako tikat na dene main koi sajeesh he?mudda bada he
 Why has remote seat Barmer become so important? Why did Colonel Sonaram break into Congress and join BJP? Is there a case for some money? i do not think you should extend this question further, because this issue will arise tomorrow, if not today
 kya isamen aarthik phaayde kaa pahalu bhi judaa hua he?main isse zyada or kuch nahin kahana chahta ki badi rakam kaa maamla he
 
 
 a case of oil
 or tel duniya bhar main bhrashtachar kaa janak he
 The fear was that i could spoil the game
 yah koi hawaii baat nahin he
 The whole world understands this
 yahi baat bijepi ke varisht netaa sochate hai
 Have you tried to change your stand on Barmer? No, never
 bijepi main log mere bare main jaanate hai
 Any message from RSS? RSS? What do you talk about! Have leaders in BJP become portable (worth sending anywhere)? The same happened with Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi? This party is no longer capable of running the rule of India
 yahi hakeekat he
 If you are drawn like cattle
 
 
 main nahin samaj paata
 The last time we met, you said that this Lok Sabha election will be your last battle
 kya yah aapke liye pratishtha kii jang he?bilkul
 a lot of people ask, "what will happen if you lose?" If this happens, at least i will lose in my house and against all the hiccups
 congress or bijepi mere khilaaf hai or sangh kuch nahin bolegaa
 You know, who is standing in my favor? Muslim voters in my area
 ve mujhe apana rakshak maanate hai
 Because of this your chances are high? We are very close to Sindh
 khaas baat yah he ki meraa janm yaheen hua he
 i grew up here
 main is bhoomi kii dein hum
 i was married to the prominent Rajput tribe of Jaisalmer
 mere rishtedaar aaj bhi sindh main hai
 But they got entangled in the caste equations
 oh, yah rajput he
 But this is a Jat dominated parliamentary constituency
 ise itane halke main mat lijie
 i believe this thing is destroying the cultural identity of this place
 
 
 agar ham ise jat, rajput or musalamaanon main baant denge
 
 
 We will destroy the dignity of this land
 or isi baat kii vajah se hi to bantwaaraa hua tha
 If you win, will you return to BJP? Why will i go to BJP? i repeatedly asked Advani, Rajnath Singh, Nitin why i was fired
 No one answered nikaalane ke us ashisht vyavhaar ko jawaab na dekar or badha diya gaya
 But this time the party has not fired you
 is baar to gahari chuppi lagati he
 It is suicidal silence, not deep silence
 party ke paas apni kaaryastylee main ek khaas tarah kaa darshan sthapit karne kaa mauka tha
 But she seems to have been held hostage to inaction
 ek khaas mukhyamantri yaa mukhyamantriyon ke gathjod ne party adhyaksh ko baadhya kiya ki mujhe apane ghar se chunaav ladgaye kii ijaajat na di jaae?media yah sawaal jetali se kyon nahin poochta? ve amritsar se kyon lard rahe hai? ve to dilli main rahete or kaam karte hai
 They are originally from Jammu
 isliye ve vahaan se kyon nahin ladate?apane gharelu kshetra se laduya ek baat hoti he
 Vasundhara cannot understand this
 vasundhara kii sabha main ek bhi musalmaan nahin tha lekin meri sabhaaon main baari sankhya main musalmaan the
 i advocate such a social unity which has been our historical heritage
 or bijepi is ekta ko toduya chaahati he jiskaa aarambh usne meri ummidavaari se inkaar karke kiya
 What did you say to Advani on March 21? i met him for 10-15 minutes
 maine unase yah nahin kaha ki main apana parchaa bharne ja rahaa hum
 Just said, "what i am going to do will separate our path
" main itane varshon ke saath ke liye aapkaa aabhaar vyakt karata hum
 "they said," Now what to say? " It was a very emotional moment
 ham 34 saal se saath the

 doosraa medal bhi pakkaa he pivi sindhu kaa
 How do we see these achievements? Vijay goel-pv Sindhu is the second woman who has made the country proud

 badi uplabdhi rahi unki?vijay goyal-sakshi malik ne jo mehnat ki laajawab he or haryana kii mahila resler is oonchaaiyon tak pahonchegi, yah hamen dekhakar bahut garv hota he

 sawaal- khabar yah bhi ai ki narsingh yadav nahin khel paaenge
 Has been banned for 4 years
 tamaam vivaad hue, sawaal uthaaya usne ki sajeesh hui he?vijay goyal-abhi hamen aadhikarik taur par isaki soochna nahin mili he

 anti doping agency thi
 He had cleared them

 Question- You went to Rio and there was a dispute
 us vakt koi medal nahin mila tha
 The medals are won at this time

 Many of our players remained in fourth place
 sawaal- aapke vivaad kaa kya hoga, jo vahaan aapke saath vivaad khadaa ho gaya? aap maidan main chale gaye, aap ke logon ne vahaan yah sab kiya? aap samajhate hai vah bura adhyay tha aapke liye?vijay goyal-dekhie kisi prakaar kaa koi vivaad tha hi nahin
 But if the medals were not coming, there would have been some controversy because of that
 khilaadiyon ko protsaahit karnaa or paas banavaakar janaa koi galat baat nahin thi
 That too after the match
 main samajhataa hum ki vahiin ke adhikari mujhe vahaan par lekar gaye the

 congress ne jahaan modi par palatwaar karte hue dharmanirpekshata ke 'burke' ko nagn sampradayikta se behatar bataaya, vahiin bhaajapa ke kai netaa somvaar ko modi ke bachaav main aa gaye
 Modi had said that the Congress hides in the 'burqa' of the secularist when the crisis arises
 modi ke bayaan par pratikriya vyakt karte hue somvaar ko congress mahasachiv ajay maakan ne kaha, "dharmanirpekshata kaa 'burka' nagn sampradayikta se kahin adhik behatar he
 Communalism divides the country, while secularism keeps it united
 " unhone modi ko yah bhi naseehat di ki pehle apane rajya kii sthiti behatar banaaen or phir centre ko vikaas par sikh den
 "modi has no moral right to criticize the central government, as he has failed as the Chief Minister of Gujarat," Maken told reporters
 unhen juthi abha banane kaa adhikaar nahin he
 " modi ne shanivaar ko pune main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue samprag par aarthik vikaas ke maamle main bhi vifal rahane kaa aarope lagaaya tha, jiske jawaab main maakan ne somvaar ko kaha ki centre main bhaajapa ke netritv vaale rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) kii sarkaar ne varsh 1998-2004 ke chah varsh ke kaarykaal main or gujarat main swayan modi kii sarkaar ne utana vikaas nahin kiya, jitna samprag ke kaarykaal main hua
 Maken said, "we need to answer their allegations based on the wrong facts

 sampradayikta desh ko baantati he, jabaki dharmanirpekshata ise ekajute rakhti he
 "he also instructed Modi to first improve the state of his state and then teach the Center on development
 maakan ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, "modi ko centre sarkaar kii aalochana karne kaa koi naitik adhikaar nahin he, kyonki gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke rup main vah vifal rahe hai
 They do not have the right to create false aura
 " Modi, while addressing a rally in Pune on Saturday, accused the UPA of failing in economic development too, in response to which Maken said on Monday that the bjp-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Center During the six-year tenure of 1998-2004, Modi's government in Gujarat itself did not develop as much as upa's tenure

 We want to tell our success stories to people
 " Maken said that in many matters including education, health, sports and economic development, the UPA has outperformed the NDA government

 Recently, the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir Satyapal Malik launched a new Shigufa that Hurriyat is ready to negotiate with the Congress government
 unhone ye bhi daawa kiya ki ghati main pichley ek saal main halaat sanbhale hai
 After this, Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said in an interview to the international media that he welcomes the dialogue and the Hurriyat always supports it to solve the Kashmir problem
 lekin is par centre sarkaar kii taraf se koi pahal nahin hui he
 The statement was not even remotely welcomed by Union Home Minister Amit Shah during his visit to Kashmir
 shah ne samaaj ke kai tabakon se baatcheet kii lekin rajnatik muddon, siyaasi dalon or algaavvaadiyon se duuri banaae rakhi
 So is the Governor's statement of consent to Hurriyat's conversation more than patting his back? The reason for this conclusion is that terrorism and dialogue of the Indian government cannot go hand in hand with no change in Indian policy
 ise grih mantri amit shah ke daure se pehle kya apni report card ke taur par pesh karne kii koshish kar rahe the rajyapal malik? is sandarbh main gaur karne vaali baat ye he ki rajyapal ne daawa kiya ki beete ek saal main kashmir ghati main halaat sudhare hai
 But the picture does not look so bright in the mirror of the ground reality! In the first 25 days of June, there have been more than 11 encounters so far
 inamen 21 aatanki maare gaye hai jinamein se adhikansh sthaneey ladke hai
 Terrorist organizations have been successful in linking local boys with terror in the recent past
 ek anumaan ke mutabik is saal kam se kam 60 sthaneey yuva saal 2019 main abhi tak hathiyaar uthaa chuke hai
 So far in June, 12 boys have joined terror
 jinamein se ek uttari kashmir ke baraamula se he jo ki isi saal janvari main aatank mukt zila ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 If terrorists are successful in sowing and reaping new lots, then there is a big question mark on the policy of declaring terror free
 beete 6 maheenon main 100 se zyada aatankwaadi dher kiye ja chuke hai
 The Indian Army has also lost several soldiers in the terrorist attacks, including a Major Rank officer, a few days ago
 kendriya grih mantri amit shah ne apane pehle kashmir daure main bhi antakawaad ke prati zero tolerance apnaane ko kaha
 He claims that for the first time after independence, a government has adopted this policy against terrorism
 rashtriya suraksha se koi samjhauta na karne kaa sandesh diya ja rahaa he
 Means that irrigate terror are being attacked
 teror funding par jari jaanch agenciyon kii karrwai main hurriyat ke kai netaaon ke khilaaf shikanja ksaa he
 Indian investigative agencies are active on many fronts against terror
 rashtriya jaanch agency or pravartan nideshaalay ne aatank virdohi abhiyaanon ko tej kiya he
 India believes that Pakistan sends hawala money to Hurriyat leaders through many traders to spread terror
 isi maheene teen algaavvaadiyon ko aatank bhadakaane ke liye paise lene ke aarope main giraftaar kiya gaya
 Shabbir Shah, Masrat Alam and Asiya Andrabi have been jailed for waging war against the Indian government
 iske alaava algaavvaadiyon kii sampatti par bhi sarkaar kii tedi nazar he
 The house of Zahoor Ahmad Shah, son-in-law of Syed Ali Shah Geelani, was seized in Gurgaon near Delhi
 mirawaise umr farukh, saiyad ali shah gilaani or jexlef ke adhyaksh yaccin malik ko di gai suraksha sarkaar ne waapas le lee
 On Friday, Home Minister Amit Shah himself admitted in the Lok Sabha that the government has withdrawn the security of 919 people who are not in danger
 inamen zyaadaatar algaavvaadi or pakistan ke hamdard hai
 In such a situation, Amit Shah will open the doors of talks with the separatists whom the Modi government considers the puppet of Pakistan, it seems unlikely
 hurriyat agar baatcheet ke liye lacheela ravaiya dikhaa rahi he to kahin na kahin ye un par pad rahi sarkari agenciyon kii jaanch kii aanch kaa nateeja ho sakati he
 Home Minister Amit Shah said that Kashmiriyat is not in shedding blood
 bharat ke virodh main nahin he
 Will the Kashmiri people talk about peeping into the hearts of the residents here, or will they respond only with guns and aggressive remarks
 aatank kii fasal jitani katati he usase zyada rope di jaati he
 It is, and will remain, the responsibility of our rulers to decide when and how this process will stop
 intazaar sarkaar kii ore se sakaaratmak pahal kaa he
 The wait can be prolonged because the home minister of the country is in favor of removing Article 370 giving special rights to Kashmir
 agar ye kabhi hua to ye kashmir ke itihaas main ek bada adhyay hoga or uske anjaam bhugatne ke liye hamen taiyaar rahanaa hoga

 arabiai ne khudara mulya suchakank main dekhi ja rahi mahangaai ko lekar bhi chintaa jataai he
 The RBI has also indicated an increase in interest rates by expressing concern about inflation

 In 1982, Justice PN Bhagwati said in his judgment that half the workers are working as a bonded laborer due to lower minimum wages
 bharat main sangathit or asangathit kshetra kii mazaduri main hi bhayanak antar he
 According to a study, in 2010-11, regular laborers were getting Rs 392 per day, while the unorganized sector was getting Rs 143
 mazdoor sangh bhi asganthit kshetra ke mazaduron kii baat jor shor se nahin karte jabaki ab zyaadaatar mazdoor isi kshetra se aate hai jo ek tihaai kam mazaduri par kaam karte hai
 Central labor organizations have threatened to go on strike since Friday
 unki maang he ki nunemat mazaduri badhaai jaae
 The Seventh Pay Commission has raised the minimum wage to Rs 18,000 per month in the central government
 karmchaaree sanghathan chaahate hai ki yah 18,000 kii jagah 26,000 honi chahie
 On the basis of the Seventh Pay Commission, the labor unions are saying that the minimum wage of unskilled laborers should be 18,000
 pichley saal das kendriya mazdoor sanghon kii hadtaal hui thi tab maang kii gai thi ki akushal mazdoor ke liye nunatam mazaduri kii dar 6,330 rupee maheene se badhaakar 15,000 kar di jaae
 These organizations claim that they have 15 crore members, yet 15 crore people could not get minimum wages of Rs 15,000 for themselves
 pichley saal neutnam mazaduri badi lekin sirf 7,098 rupee hi hui, 15,000 nahin hui
 Now these organizations are talking about going on strike again
 is baar 15,000 kii jagah 18,000 rupee nunatam mazaduri karne kii maang he
 On 30 August, the central government has decided to increase the minimum wage to Rs 350 per day
 ab akushal mazdoor kii mazaduri har din 246 rupee kii jagah 350 rupee hogi
 If you multiply it by 30 days of the month, then the monthly earnings of unskilled laborers will be 10,500
 dilli sarkaar ne haal hi main nunatam mazaduri main 50 fisadi badhottaree kaa elaan kiya he
 If implemented, the wages of unskilled laborers would be Rs 14,052 per month
 kushal mazdoor kaa vetan 17,033 hoga
 Dermaha of a semi-skilled worker will be Rs 15,471
 18,000 rupee to dilli main bhi nahin hote hai lekin phir bhi dilli main nunatam mazaduri 18,000 ke kareeb he or aasapaas ke rajyon kii tulana main 80 se 100 fisadi zyaada he
 If you ask any economist, two things will be said
 aarthik asamanta bad rahi he or berojgaare bhi
 They will also say this by economists who believe that India's economy is growing rapidly
 duniya bhar main aarthik asamanta ko lekar chintaa he
 People's earnings are not increasing
 kya karodon log aaj ke jamaane main 18,000 rupee se kam main rah sakate hai, rahete hi hai lekin hamen yah bhi dekhnaa hoga ki ve kis halaat main rah rahe hai
 It is a matter of fact that these people are not on Twitter, otherwise they sign the tweet every day for 15,000 and the salary is less than 10,000
 ye sab twit hone lage or trend hone lage to twitor par demokrasi kaa mazaa karaab ho saktaa he
 By the way, you should ask all the workers from your security guard how they run a family for a salary of eight to nine thousand
 ham kuch nahin kar sakate, lekin puch to sakate hi hai
 There is talk of increasing the minimum wage worldwide
 iske badhaane se udyog or rojgaar par kya asar padegaa, alag-alag research ke alag-alag daawey hai
 Some say that if 10% of the minimum wage increases, then 2% of the employment decreases
 koi kahata he ki nunatam mazaduri badhane se utpaadakta bad jaati he or company ko munafa hota he
 Some say that if the minimum wage is increased, companies or people will adopt automatic methods
 jaise ve nahin badhaane par automatic tareeke apnaanaa band kar dete hai
 Some arguments make sense, some are absurd
 puri duniya main yah chunauti he ki kaise nunatam mazaduri badhaai jaae kyonki ab iske bina guzaaraa nahin chalane vaala he
 You cannot see such a large population dying in the name of living on low wages
 newzealand or finland chote str par ek nayaa model apnaane ja rahe hai
 Basic income will be given to all
 kai staron par ise lekar bahes shuru ho gai he
 In April this year, Britain passed a law called National Living Wage
 iske tahat 25 saal yaa usase adhik ke kaamgaar ko har ghante kii mazaduri hogi 7
 20 pounds
 pehle 6
 Only used to get 70 pounds
 neshnal living veg lagu karne ke liye niyoktaaon ke liye kadi sazaa kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 For this, a toll number has been given at the national level where the worker can complain
 tippaniyan Even in the US, Bernie Senders made 7 per hour
 25 dollar nunatam mazaduri ko 15 dollar karne kii baat kahi thi
 Compare with Indian rupees, the minimum wage in America at this time is 485 rupees per hour
 america main nunatam mazaduri kii dar se ek kaamgaar aath ghante main 3,884 rupee kamata he, jabaki bharat main aath ghante main 350 rupee
 American workers are ten times, but their GDP is also many times larger than us
 kya bharat main 15,000 yaa 18,000 rupee prati maah kii nunatam mazaduri kii maang jaays nahin he
 The Central Statistic Office has released a data, according to which the GDP of India in the april-june quarter 7
 1 pratishat darj hui he
 This is the lowest progress in the last six quarters
 ummid kii ja rahi thi ki jidipi dar 7
 6 percent, but 7
 1 pratishat hi darj hui
 The april-june quarter's GDP has come down due to decline in mining, construction and farming
 ye chunautiyaan hai, lekin ye chunautiyaan vidhayakon ke liye nahin hai
 On Wednesday itself, Haryana has increased the salary of its mlas
 teen saal main unki tankhwaah dabl ho gai he
 With a vote of fifteen crores, those who become mlas increase their salary, but 15 crores are not able to increase their wages
 saatven vetan ayog ne centre sarkaar main nunatam vetan 18,000 rupee prati maah kar diya he
 Employee organizations want it to be 26,000 instead of 18,000
 saatven vetan ayog ke aadhaar par mazdoor sangh kah rahe hai ki akushal mazaduron kii nunatam mazaduri 18,000 ho
 Ten central labor unions went on strike last year when it was demanded that the minimum wage rate for unskilled laborers be increased from Rs 6,330 to Rs 15,000 per month
 in sanghathanon kaa daawa he ki inke 15 karod sadsy hai phir bhi 15 karod log apane liye 15,000 rupee kii nunatam mazaduri hasil nahin kar sake
 Last year, the minimum wage increased but only Rs 7,098, not 15,000
 ab ye sanghathan phir se hadtaal par jane kii baat kar rahe hai
 This time there is a demand for minimum wages of Rs 18,000 instead of 15,000
 30 agast ko centre sarkaar ne nunemat mazaduri main 350 rupee rose kaa badhaane kaa faisla kiya he
 Now the wages of unskilled laborers will be Rs 350 instead of Rs 246 every day
 agar aap ise maheene ke 30 din se guna karen to akushal mazdoor kii masik kamai hogi 10,500
 The Delhi government has recently announced a 50 percent increase in the minimum wage
 agar yah lagu hua to akushal mazdoor kaa pagaar 14,052 rupee prati maah hoga
 The salary of a skilled worker will be 17,033
 ardhakushal mazdoor kaa darmaha 15,471 rupee hoga
 Even 18,000 rupees are not available in Delhi, but even then the minimum wage in Delhi is around 18,000 and 80 to 100 percent more than the surrounding states
 aap kisi bhi arthshaastri se puuchhenge to do baat kahenge
 Economic inequality is increasing and unemployment as well
 yah baat ve arthshaastri bhi kahenge jo maanate hai ki bharat kii arthvyavastha tezi se bad rahi he
 There is concern about economic inequality around the world
 logon kii kamai nahin bad rahi he
 Whether crores of people can live in less than 18,000 rupees in the present day, but we also have to see what conditions they are living under
 ganimat he ki ye log twitor par nahin hai, varna rose twit karte dastakhat 15,000 par karaate hai or vetan miltaa he 10,000 se bhi kam
 If all these tweets start happening and trend, then the popularity of democracy on Twitter can be spoiled
 vaise aapako apane security guard se lekar tamaam mazaduron se poochna chahie ki ve aath nau hazaar ke vetan main kaise parivaar chalaate hai
 We cannot do anything, but we can ask
 duniya bhar main nunatam mazaduri badhaane kii baat ho rahi he
 What will be the impact on the industry and employment by increasing it, different research has different claims
 koi kahata he ki 10 fisadi nunemat mazaduri bade to 2 fisadi rojgaar kam ho jaataa he
 Some say that increasing the minimum wage increases productivity and profits the company
 koi kahata he ki nunatam mazaduri badhaayenge to companiyaan yaa log automatic tareeke apanaayenge
 As such, they stop adopting automatic methods if not increased
 kuch tarkon main tuk he, kuch betuke hai
 The challenge all over the world is how to increase the minimum wage because now there is no way to live without it
 aap itani badi aabaadi ko kam vetan par jeene ke naam par marate hue nahin dekh sakate he
 New Zealand and Finland are adopting a new model on a smaller scale

 Under this, a worker of 25 years or more will get an hourly wage
 20 pound
 First 6
 70 pound hi miltaa tha
 a stringent punishment has been made for employers to implement the National Living Wage
 iske liye rashtriya str par ek toll number diya gaya jahaan mazdoor shikaayat kar saktaa he
 The comments america main bhi barney sanders ne prati ghante 7
 The $ 25 minimum wage was said to be $ 15
 bhartiya rupee se tulana karen is vakt america main nunemat mazaduri har ghante kii 485 rupee he
 In the US, a worker at the minimum wage rate earns Rs 3,884 in eight hours, while in India Rs 350 in eight hours
 amareeki mazdoor das guna he, lekin unki jidipi bhi hamase kai guna badi he
 Is the demand for a minimum wage of 15,000 or 18,000 rupees per month not valid in India
 central statistic offis ne ek data jari kiya he, uske anusaar april-june kii timahi main bharat kii jidipi 7
 1 percent is recorded
 pichley chah timahi main yah sabase kam pragati he
 The GDP rate was expected to be 7
 6 pratishat rahegi, lekin 7
 Only 1 percent was recorded
 khanan, construction or kheti main giravat aane se april-june timahi kii jidipi kam hui he
 These are challenges, but these challenges are not for the legislators

 apane videsh daure main unhone tisare bimstek shikhar sammelan main hissaa liya
 The special thing during Manmohan Singh's foreign trip has been that he did not talk to journalists while returning
 aamtaur par pradhanmantri apni videsh yatra se lautate samay patrakaron se baatcheet karte hai
 For this, a schedule is set and complete preparations are made
 lekin, is baar aisa nahin hua
 External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid came to talk to journalists in place of PM
 piem ke nahin aane kii vajah kya ho sakati he? is par khurshid ne kaha, 'piem mujhe test karnaa chaahate the
 If he had come, i might not have got a chance
 virdohi manmohan singh par aarope lagaate hai wo kuch bolte hi nahin hai
 However, while returning from his last trip abroad, Manmohan Singh talked to the media about many things that made headlines
 unhone bijepi ke piem ummidavaar narendra modi ko gujarat dange ke liye jimmedaar tehraate hue kaha ki agar wo pradhanmantri bane to tabaahi aa jaaegi
 The PM also cleared the way to present Rahul Gandhi as Prime Minister before the general elections
 is baar myanma daure par singh ne shikhar sammelan se itar kai dwipaksheeya baithken bhi kin
 He met Myanmar President u Thi Seon, Nepal's Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Myanmar's pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi

 Wikileaks ne aipal ke produkats kii hekking par ek nayaa khulaasa kiya he
 This time, this institution has cited some of the cia's confidential documents
 haal hi main jari kiye gaye ek duusare dastavej main yah khulaasa kiya tha ki america khufia agency siie whatsap yaa telegram jaise instent miseging ap main send laga sakati he
 It was also said in the report that companies have done this many times

 It describes how CIA agents target Apple Mac operating systems and ios devices
 is taaja li ke mutabik phone yaa computer ko agar yujar factory riset bhi kar de to havers uski divaais main send laga sakate hai

 iske liye agency ne khaas mailaware banaaya he jo aipal ke formaware yani software ko torget karata he
 Once installed, even if you reinstall macos or ios, the malware does not stop
 Wikileaks ke mutabik jari kiye gaye dastavej siie dwaara aipak ke mike divison main send lagane ke liye yuj kiye gaye technic ke bare main bhi bataaya gaya he
 The November 2012 documentation of the sonic screwdriver hacking tool Wikileaks mentions the Sonic Screwdriver Tool project, and according to the CIA is a tool to execute code when Mac laptops and desktops are booted

 This is a way for hackers to inject malware into a computer's firmware via a peripheral device such as a USB stick or an external hard drive
 agar formaware main password laga he phir bhi mailaware ke jariye usamen send lagaai ja sakati he
 Currently, Apple has nothing on this matter, nor has the Central Intelligence Agency said anything on the matter

 There is also a problem in printing of two thousand notes
 unhone kaha ki vikaas ke maamle main samaajwaadiyon kaa koi muqabla nahin he
 No one could have imagined that 24 hours of electricity is coming in the cities of the state
 ab bhaajapa ke log bataaen ki kya ve hamase zyada bijli denge
 If you want to give, then they have to increase the hours
 is maukey par basapa par bhi prahaar karte hue mukhyamantri ne kaha ‘‘duusari ore pathar vaali party he

 aise main jahaan channel kapil ke sho se khush hokar uski fees 106 karod karne kaa elaan kar chukaa tha, usee channel ne sho kii is haalat ko sudhaarney ke liye kapil sharma ko sirf ek maheene hi vakt diya he
 Kapil has shot three episodes after Sunil Grover left
 khabar he ki aane vaale do episod ke baad sunil grover waapas entry kar sakate hai
 Media reports quoted sources associated with the channel as saying that Sunil might be returning to the Kapil Sharma show soon
 sunil ne jhagade se pehle hi apane personal shoj ke liye production waalon se chuttee maang rakhi thi
 The upcoming four episodes without Sunil were also scheduled to be shot
 aise main, kapil or sunil ke jhagade ne ise ek nayaa mode de diya he
 Sunil was going to perform comedy live shows during his holidays
 ek taraf jahaan is jhagade ke baad sunil or kapil donon hi soshal media par apni-apni baat kah chuke hai, lekin sunil grover ne yah kahin bhi nahin kaha ki vah is sho ko chhod rahe hai
 It is believed that Sunil Grover has not officially made any distance from the show
 sutron ke anusaar, agle sho kaa shedul 7, 8, 11 or 12 april tay kiya gaya he
 Kapil is currently in Rajasthan for the shooting of his upcoming film Firangi
 vahaan se shooting puri kar vah 7 april ko mumbai aakar apane sho ke aane vaale episods kii shooting karenge
 According to the sources associated with the show, Sunil will also join the show in the last week of this month
 lekin yah vaapasi channel ke liye thodi mahangi pad rahi he
 Actually Sunil will rejoin the show only by increasing his fees
 yaad dilaate chalem ki haal hi main australia se lautate vakt kapil sharma or sunil grover, samet puri team se hue jhagade ne achaanak is superhit sho ke liye museebataan khadi kar di thim
 After this quarrel, artists such as Sunil Grover, Ali Asgar, Chandan Prabhakar and Sugandha Mishra have been cut off
 kapil kaa sho chhodane ke baad jahaan ali asagar sab tivi ke ek sho main najar aa rahe hai to vahiin sugandha mishra or sunil grover soni channel ke hi rielity singing sho 'indian idal' ke grand phinale main najar aa chuke hai
 While both Sunil and Kapil have spoken on social media after this quarrel, Sunil Grover has not said anywhere that he is leaving the show
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki sunil grover ne aadhikarik taur par sho se koi duuri nahin banaai he
 According to sources, the schedule for the next show has been set for April 7, 8, 11 and 12
 kapil in dinon apni apakaming film 'firangi' kii shooting ke liye rajasthan main hai
 After completing the shoot from there, he will come to Mumbai on April 7 to shoot for the upcoming episodes of his show
 sho se jude sutron kii maane, to is maheene ke aakhri hafte main sunil bhi is sho se jud jaaenge
 But this comeback is a bit expensive for the channel
 darasal sunil apni fees badha kar hi is sho se dobaaraa judenge
 Let me remind you that the recent quarrels with the entire team, including Kapil Sharma and Sunil Grover, while returning from Australia, suddenly caused trouble for this superhit show
 is jhagade ke baad sunil grover, ali asagar, chandan prabhakar or sugandha mishra jaise kalakaaron ne kanni kaat lee he
 While Ali Asgar is seen on a SAB TV show after Kapil left the show, Sugandha Mishra and Sunil Grover have appeared in the grand finale of Sony Channel's reality singing show 'indian Idol'

 maharashtra main emm ko mili kamyaabi ke baad atakalein chal rahi hai ki dilli chunaav main bhi ye party apni kismat aazamaa sakati he
 It is also being calculated that if the party decides to contest the election here, then who will be the biggest loser, who will get more benefit for the Aam Aadmi Party or Congress, BJP or MIM, regardless of the profit and loss of all of them
 Will win one or two seats and open an account
 inhen sab sawaalon ko lekar maine subah emm netaa asaduddin ovaisi ko phone kiya
 Owaisi has said that the party has not made a decision of yes or no about the Delhi elections
 kuch log zarur sampark main aae hai, jo chaahate hai ki wo emm ke tikat par chunaav laden, lekin hamaari party kaa ek mat saaf he
 We do not want to build our base with angry leaders of any other party
 ham jahaan bhi kadam rakhane kaa faisalaa karte hai, nayaa or acha ummidavaar khojate hai
 At the moment, we have morphed into Maharashtra's election strategy
 dilli main hamaari party kaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 Neither is the organization
 iske baavjood agar koi acha or sahi ummidavaar mila, to chunaav main utarane kii soch sakate hai
 But today your question is whether MIM has decided, then the answer is that we are evaluating the situation
 party ke bheetar baat-vichaar ho rahaa he, magar koi faisla nahin hua he
 Two MIM mlas have been elected in the recently held Maharashtra assembly elections
 kuch siton par party ne haar kar bhi rajya kii sthapit partiyon ko chaunkaaya he
 MIM had also fielded four Dalit candidates in Maharashtra
 karnataka main march, 2013 ke sthaneey nikaayon ke chunaav main emm ke chah parshad chune gaye the
 Owaisi also objected to the statement of Congress leader Praniti Shinde printed in the Indian Express
 praniti scindia kaa bayaan he ki emm desh ke hit ke kilaaf nahin he
 He has never attempted to put his ideas on a democratic platform
 main chaahati hum ki emm ko bain kar dena chahie
 Owaisi said that during the UPA government for ten years, we have been allies
 jab praniti ke pita (susheel kumaar scindia) grahamantri the, tab bhi ham unase mila karte the
 Have they ever felt that they are speaking to a terrorist or anti-national leader
 ovaisi ne kaha ki maharashtra chunaav main hamaare jitne bhi bhaashan hue hai sabhi you-tub par hai
 Those speeches should be heard before my criticism
 mujhe kai jagahon par bhaashan se pehle police ne notice diya ki bhadakaau bhaashan na karun
 Has it happened to anyone else that the leader reached the stage and was caught notice beforehand
 phir bhi is nigaraanee ke baavjood hamane bhadakaau bhaashan diya he, to use pehle saamne to laayaa jaae

 This will give Dhoni more options in bowling as well
