 Pakistan knows how expert it is to lie
 vah khud bhi apni harkaton se yah sabit karata rahata he ki use sach pasand nahin he
 Now once again the spokesman of the Pakistan Army has himself given proof that as much lies are lied against India on his soil
 bharat ke ection se baukhalaaye pakistan ne buudhvaar ko vayusima kaa ulanghan karte hue bharat main atake karne kaa prayaas kiya
 When the three aircraft of Pakistan crossed the loc and came to the Indian border, they were given a befitting reply by the Air Force
 haalanki, pakistan aircraft ko khadedate hue bhartiya vayusena kaa ek vimaan or ek payalat laapata ho gaya
 But Pakistan claimed that two Indian pilots are in its custody and two Indian Air Force aircraft were shot down
 pakistani sena ke pravaktaa major general asif gafoor ne bataaya ki hamaara plan bhartiya sena yaa naagarik ko nuksna pahunchaana nahin tha
 He said that when we took our targets, two ships of the Indian Air Force crossed the Line of Control and came to Pakistan, which was attacked and killed by the Pakistani Air Force
 asif gafoor ne bataaya ki in do vimaanon main ek kaa malba pakistani sarhad main gira, jabaki doosraa bhartiya seemaa main dhwast hua
 Along with this, Asif Gafoor also claimed that two pilots were detained by our army
 ek unamem se jakhmi the, jinhen ilaaj ke liye bheja gaya he, or duusare payalat hamaari hiraasat main he
 Disclosure of his lie The representative of the Pakistani army has now shamelessly declared his own statement as false
 major general asif gafoor ne twit kar bataaya he ki pakistan kii hiraasat main keval ek payalat he
 They claimed that the Indian pilot is in our custody and they are being treated keeping in mind the military rules
 yani buudhvaar dopaher asif gafoor ne video sandesh main media ke saamne do bhartiya payalat ko hiraasat main lene kaa jo daawa kiya tha, vah unhone khud hi khokhla sabit kar diya
 Let me tell you that the Indian Foreign Ministry had said in its official statement about the disappearance of a pilot and an aircraft, after which Pakistan changed its statement to say that there is only one pilot in their custody

 If the election results are on the way to the exit poll, then the so-called Federal Front may be disintegrated before it starts
 philhal aisa lag rahaa he ki gaiyr-bhaajapa dalon ke liye loksabhaa main bahut adhik, yani jitani wo ummid kar rahe the, utani jagah to nahin he

 lekin ek khaas baat jo gaur karne yogya he ki aakhir is saal ke ant main jin rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hone vaale hai vahaan in nateezon kaa kya asar pad saktaa he
 Assembly elections are due in Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Haryana later this year
 saal 2014 main jammu or kashmir main bhi vidhansabha chunaav karaayaa gaya tha par vahaan raashtrapati shashan lagu he or vahaan kaa chunaav anukool paristhitiyon main hi karaayaa jayega
 Nevertheless, if the elections were held in Jammu and Kashmir, then bjp's relationship with Sajjad Gani Lone from the seats won in the Lok Sabha elections would have been even stronger
 ubharate hue yuva netaa lone ghati main asardaar hai or jammu kshetra main bhaajapa adhiktam siton ke saath nai tarah kii sarkaar banane kii koshish karegi
 The fate of Chief Minister Raghubar Das is tied to the seats the BJP gets in Jharkhand
 pradesh bhaajapa ke sutara bataate hai, "agar bhaajapa pichhlaa pradarshan doharaa na bhi paae par thik-thaak pradarshan kar jaae to mukhyamantri bane rahenge
 But if the BJP performs badly in Jharkhand, then instead of Das, the party can project a tribal as the face of the Chief Minister
 par adhik ummid yahi he ki soobe kaa chunaav modi ke naam par hi ladaa jayega
 "significantly, the BJP in Jharkhand has been shown to be performing well in the exit poll
 haryana main bhi yahi sthiti he
 After winning the election, the central leadership of the BJP took the stakes of a non-jat chief minister in Haryana
 par, loksabhaa ke nattejey manamafik nahin aate hai to yah sameekaran ulat bhi diya ja saktaa he
 In Maharashtra, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray came together on a platform to directly explain to voters why they regrouped after four and a half years of fiercely criticizing each other
 Has happened
 haalanki shivasena ne ram mandir or rashtriya suraksha ke muddon par ekajutata dikhaane kii bharsak koshish kii
 But it is also certain that BJP and Shiv Sena will fight together in the assembly this time
 agar loksabhaa ke nateezon main is gathjod ko kam siten hasil hoti hai to tab to haath se haath mili rahenge
 But if the performance of either Shiv Sena or BJP is less than the other, then its effect will be seen during the assembly elections

 The court has said that even the women who do not have Aadhaar card, bank account and passbook again, the government cannot deny the benefits of this scheme
 darasal dilli sarkaar kii taraf se janani suraksha yojana kaa laabh sirf unheen mahilaon ko diya ja rahaa he jinke paas bank acount, aadhaar card yaa phir passbook he
 The High Court has clearly stated to the government in this matter that the government does not have any legal right to prevent women without Aadhaar card from availing this facility
 hai court ne dilli sarkaar ko aadesh diya he ki jo bhi mahilaayein janani suraksha yojana ke liye hakdaar hai unhen bina aadhaar or bina acount kii jaankaree ke is suvidha kaa laabh diya jaae

 The court said that under no circumstances can entitled women be denied the benefit of this facility to which they are entitled
 court ne kaha ki is tarah kii skims ke liye to khaas taur par mahilaon ko jaagruk karne ke liye sarkaar ko vigyaapan dene chahie or unhen yojana kaa laabh lene se judi jaankaree di jaani chahie

 a historic view was witnessed in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday
 mauka tha bharat chodo andolan ke 75 saal puure hone kaa
 On this historic occasion, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress President Sonia Gandhi remembered the brave soldiers of independence and called for inspiration from their struggle
 lekin ye mauka modi or sonia ke bich kii raajnneetik pratidwandvita se nahin batch sakaa
 The two leaders fiercely targeted each other's ideology
 ye pehla mauka tha jab sansad main modi or sonia is tarah aamane-saamne the or donon ne ise bhunaane kii koi kasar nahin chodi
 Battle of the Agendas On the occasion of the completion of 75 years of Quit India Movement, the fight between the two big leaders in Parliament was clearly visible
 jab piem modi bolne ke liye khadey hue to unhone kaha ki ye mauka mahapurushon ke balidaan ko nai peedi tak pahunchane kaa he
 This is necessary for a new India
 iske baad piem modi ne jiesti ko jahaan apni sarkaar kii uplabdhi bataaya, vahiin vipaksh ko gherne ke liye bhrashtachar kaa mudda uchhaala
 After this, when Sonia Gandhi arose to speak, she again raised the issue of intolerance by raising the issue of freedom of speech
 sonia gandhi ne kaha- aaj bharat chodo andolan ke 75 saal puure hone par logon ke man main ashanka he ki kya desh main bolne kii azaadi ko roka ja rahaa he
 The politics of hate and division has been dominant
 kai baar kanoon ke raaj par bhi gaiyr kanoonee shaktiyaan haaavee ho rahi hai
 We have to fight against all kinds of oppressive power
 pratikon par bhidntadonon netaaon ke bich desh kii aazaadee ke liye hue andolan ke pratikon ko lekar bhi bhidnt saaf dikhi
 While PM Modi mentioned Gandhiji's contribution in Quit India movement, Sonia repeatedly mentioned Nehru and Congress in the freedom movement
 yahaan tak ki sonia gandhi ne sangh kaa naam liye bina tanj ksaa ki aazaadee ke andolan kaa kuch netaaon or sanghathanon ne virodh tak kiya tha
 On the other hand, PM Modi mentioned Yodagan till Mahatma Gandhi, Dandi March, Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Chandrashekhar Azad and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose but did not name Nehru
 ye bhi padhein-sangh par sonia kaa tanj- kuch logon or sanghathanon ne kiya tha bharat chodo andolan kaa virodhanaron kii jangdonon netaaon ke bich naaron kii jang bhi dekhne ko mili
 PM Modi said that for us, there is a bigger country than a party, politics is a big national policy
 bhrashtachar ke dimak ne desh ko tabah kar diya tha, hamen is sthiti ko badalanaa hoga
 The challenge of poverty, malnutrition and education before us is the challenge of the country, not just the government
 modi ne kaha- gandhi ne naaraa diya tha karenge yaa marenge
 Let us all decide together - we will remove corruption and stay away
 garibi dur karenge dur karke rahenge
 Will connect youth with employment
 desh ko kuposhan se mukt karenge karke rahenge
 Will liberate women from the fetters that go ahead and live
 vahiin sonia gandhi ne kaha- agar hamen apni aazaadee ko surakshit rakhana he to hamen har damankaaree shakti ke khilaaf sangharsh karnaa hoga chaahe ve kitni bhi sakasham ho
 We have to fight for the India in which we believe, in which everyone in India is free, whose freedom is unquestioned

 He said, Sachin Paji is a great player and we will miss him in the team
 unka anubhav or dressing room main unki maujuudagi hamaare liye kaaphi badi cheez thi
 If Virender Sehwag is concerned about the role of the Indian team captain in the fourth Test against Australia and recovering from his own poor form, he is not given any such indication during the nets' practice at Waka

 Regular captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has been banned for one match for slow over rate in the third Test match and now the responsibility of changing the fate of India rests on Sehwag's shoulders
 duniya main sabase visphotak ballebaaj kii khyaati rakhane vaale sahvaag ne 95 test match main 50
 He has scored 8098 runs at an average of 93 but in the current tour he is 19 from six innings
 67 kii ausat keval 118 ran bana paye hai
 Sehwag's last tour has had good memories from Adelaide where the fourth and last match of the series will be played
 unhone is maidan par tab 151 ran kii pari kheli thi
 Indian players reached Waka in two groups
 pehla samooh subah das baje pahunchaa jisamen chotii ke adhiktar ballebaaj tathaa gendbaaj pragyan ojha or abhimanyu mithun shaamil the
 The second batch came at 11 pm with VVS Laxman, Sachin Tendulkar, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Sehwag himself and bowlers Ishant Sharma, Vinay Kumar and Ravichandran Ashwin
 flachar ne iske alaava yuva ballebaaj rohit sharma ke saath bhi kaaphi samay bitaayaa
 This middle-order batsman had to wait in this entire series and his wait in Adelaide may also increase
 flachar ne unhen visheshkar uthati hui gendon ko point ke upar se khilne ko lekar kuch tips diye
 Wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha also batted at the nets
 dhoni par pratibandh lagane ke baad ab yah tay he ki saaha ko edilade main wicketiper ballebaaj kii bhoomika nibhaani padegi
 Gambhir later said of him, 'he is a very good wicketkeeper
 ummid he ki vah kuch ran bhi banayega

 buudhvaar ko team perth se edilade ke liye ravaanaa hogi tathaa agle do din vishram karegi
 After this, she will practice on the net only on 21 January

 Was Nitish good with BJP and not with RJD? On the answer to this question, Sushil Modi said that both the public and Nitish Kumar themselves know this

 haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter nebif par diye bayaan par vivadakhde hone ke baad uskaa khandan kiya he or kaha he ki akhbaar ko intervyuu main unhone aisa kuch bhi nahin kaha tha
 Khattar said that he had no intention of hurting anyone's feelings
 main khed jataata hum: CM khattarmedia main maamla garmane ke baad siem khatter ne safai pesh karte hue kaha ki is desh main sadiyon se hindu-muslim sadbhaav se rahete aae hai
 He said, 'my sentiment was distorted
 agar mere shabdon se kisi ko thes pahunchati ho, to main khed jataata hum
 Khattar, who was on the backfoot after a political uproar, said, "we have grown up together
" maine ek-duusare kii bhaavana kaa sammaan karne kii baat kahi thi
 'my words have been misconstrued and twisted: Haryana CM ML Khattar on his statement on beef / Muslimspic
 twitter
 com / xyypjrkoqv — ANI (@ani_news) October 16, 2015 Earlier, Khattar's OSD said that CM Khattar did not say anything like this in an interview given to the newspaper
 OSD ne akhbaar ke ravaiye ko gairjimmedaar qaraar diya or kanoonee karrwai kii dhamkee tak di
 According to the news published in a newspaper, 'khattar has to give up eating beef,' he said, 'stay Muslim, but in this country they have to give up beef
 
 
 
 However, the Chief Minister's OSD is not ready to believe that the CM has given such a statement
 gauratlab he ki ek angreji akhbaar ko die intervyuu ke hawaale se ye khabar aa rahi thi ki khatter ne kaha tha, 'desh main muslim rah sakate hai lekin unako gomance khaanaa chhodana hoga, kyonki gaay desh main aasthaa kaa vishay he
 The beliefs of the majority population of the country are linked with cow, Gita and Saraswati and if Muslims stop eating cow meat, their religious beliefs will not get hurt
 'khatter ke OSD jawahar yadav ne kaha ki mukhyamantri ne ye jarur kaha tha ki gaay desh main aasthaa kaa vishay he
 But other things are concocted
 ye bhi kaha gaya tha ki khatter ne kaha he kidadri kii ghatana galat thi,jo ki galatfahami kii vajah se hui isamen donon pakshon kii galati thi
 Khattar said that the victim made a small comment on the cow, which hurt people's religious sentiments and the incident later turned into violence, but later added that it was very wrong to attack and kill someone
 
 khatter ne kaha ki dadri cond main jo bhi doshi he unako kanoon ke tahat sajaa milani chahie
 Congress protested, Congress attacked fiercely about this statement of Khattar
 congress pravaktaa mim afjal ne kaha ki khatter ko jaankaree honi chahie ki keval musalmaan hi bif nahin khate
 Why do they not oppose people of other religions? Whereas RJD also attacked and said, who are the Khattars who decide where to live? purv captain saurav ganguli kaa maananaa he ki team india ke cricketron ko ghar waapas bhej dena chahie, jisase ki gharavaalon se milakar wo form main vaapasi kar saken
 Losing tired and out-of-form Team India does not seem from anywhere that he is the defending champion
 iske alaava ganguli ne england ke khilaaf pradarshan ke liye team india ke ballebaajon ko bhi jamkar latada
 Ganguly said, "enough is enough, Team India cricketers should immediately pack their bags and return home, so that they can feel a little better before the next big match
 ' australia ke khilaaf team india ko ek bhi jeet naseeb nahin hui
 India first lost the Test series 0–2 and then could not win a single match against Australia and England in the tri-series
 ganguli is haar se aahat dikhe or kaha, 'team india ko is samay aaraam kii jarurat he
 It has been a long tour and now the time has come that he should meet his family before the World Cup
 agar mere haath main hota to main unamem se kuch ko ghar waapas bhej detaa
 Ganguly said on Star Sports, "I don't want to compare Steven Smith and Virat Kohli because Smith goes to his girlfriend after every match and Kohli goes from one hotel to another
 world cap main vaapasi karne ke liye team india ko apane parivaar waalon se milane kii jarurat he
 Apart from this, Ganguly lambasted the Indian batsmen especially Ravindra Jadeja
 unhone kaha ki jadeja se is baat kii safai maangi jaani chahie ki wo aisa gairjimmedaarana shot khelkar kaise out ho gaye
 At the time Jadeja was out, the team had 7 overs left and they could play a good innings by staying on the wicket for some time

 There is a strange change in our society, a strange change
 chote-chote shaharon se aisi-aisi tasviren saamne aa rahi hai ki sir shame se jhuk jaae
 Girls and women from well-educated, respectable families are now drifting on the streets drunk on liquor, in the market and even in police stations
 dehradun main ek madam paanch saal ke apane bete ke saath bazaar jaati hai,wo bhi puure surur main
 The addiction was on the head, so it did not take long to lift the market on the head, what was it
 kuch hi pal main majamaa lag gaya
 Then the police came
 badi mushkil se madam ko thane tak laayaa gaya
 But the real Dramato was probably to be held at the police station
 madam koun hai? kya karti hai? kahaan se ai hai? or kya chaahati hai? in sawaalon ke jawaab yahaan kisi ke paas nahin
 But Madam had lifted the entire police station on her head from her ruckus
 har koi madam kii ye harakatein dekhakar hairaan tha
 Now when the drama was on, some were having fun, some were trying to explain and they were feeling sorry for their condition
 lekin madam bottlegatak kar itani mast ho chuki thim ki unhen naa to duniya kii phikr thi or naa hi duniyaadaari kii
 The incident is from Patel Nagar Market in Dehradun
 ji haa, usee dehradun kaa jahaan teen roj pehle sharaab ke nashe main talli ho kar ek college girl ne bich sadak par kuch itnaa hangaamaa machaaya tha ki khud pulisavaalon kii citti-pitti gum ho gai thi
 But this was a new episode of drunkenness in this city
 somvaar shaam ko achaanak police ko khabar mili ki sharaab ke nashe main dhutt ek mahila ne puure bazaar main hangaamaa machaa rakhaa he
 Immediately upon receiving the news, the police reached the spot
 lekin yahaan pahunchate hi police ko tab jor kaa jhatka or jor se laga, jab aav naa taav dekhte hue madam sidhe pulisavaalon se hi bhid gayi
 Before the police could convince him to take the opportunity from the incident to the police station, Madam suddenly lost his senses without knowing what happened
 ye pulisavaalon ke liye unhen maukey se hataane kaa ek acha mauka hone ke saath hi mushkil bhi tha
 Because Madam was helpless by walking in her footsteps, the police somehow managed to hang her with her hands and feet and reached the police station
 lekin pikchar abhi baaki thi
 On reaching the police station, these lovers got conscious and the drama started again as soon as they came to their senses
 lekin in tamaam dramebaaji ke bich sabase badi musiibat thi madam ke saath maujuud unka paanch saal kaa chota sa baccha
 Seeing this form of his mother, this innocent too was shocked and disturbed and in view of his condition, the policemen tried to make him drink juice
 lekin abhi baccha zeus ke maje le paata ki achaanak mummy ji ko apane laadle kii yaad aa gai
 What did the mother remember dearly about that bicameral? kursi se uthne kaa ishaara nahin samaj paane par nashe main chur mummy ne apane laadle ko uthaa kar neeche patake diya or kursi par virajman ho gayi
 When the policemen passed this thing on to them, they tried to explain it
 lekin ab madam ko laga jaise bachche ko lekar unase koi galati ho gai
 After this, at first, Madam tried to convince the son
 lekin iske aage bhaawanaaon kaa jowar kuch aisa phuta ki madam foot-foot kar rone lagi
 Torn all the papers of the police station and the process of crying and washing continued for a long time
 baad main kisi tarah police ne unki medical jaanch karwaai or hosh main aane kaa intjaar kar rahi thi
 Because apart from this, the police had no choice
 lekin jab subah madam ko hosh aayaa, to nai kahani saamne aa gai
 This housewife of Dehradun had 90 thousand rupees
 jo ki nashe baaji ke chakkar main kahin gaayab ho gaye
 The nitty-gritty who stayed in the police station overnight was different

 golden temple main desh-videsh se badi sankhya main pratidin shraddhalu maathaa techne aate hai
 From Thursday, car service has started in Sachkhand Shri Harmandir Sahib to bring the glow of gold in its original form
 birmingham se aae 'guru nanak nishkaam seva jattha' ko car seva kii jimmedaari saunpi gai he
 In this work, full cooperation is being done by Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC)

 The process of rinsing with this water will be repeated again and again until the gold glow reaches its true form
 ye car seva 10 din tak chalane kii sambhaavna he
 'raees' who arrived at the Golden Temple to pay obeisance, Sukhbir Singh, a member of 'guru Nanak Nishkam Sevak Jatha' from Birmingham, said that now this car service will be done every year
 jatthe ke 20 sadsy subah 8 baje se shaam 6 baje tak sone kii dhulaai kar rahe hai
 The service to enhance the brightness of gold was first introduced in 1999
 tab se ab tak 15 baar ye seva ho chuki he
 Additional manager Sukhraj Singh, who oversees the system of devotees visiting Sukhkhand Shri Harmandir Sahib, needs to submit identity cards to those who serve in the langar of Shri Harimandir Sahib said that several steps have been taken to prevent the effect of air pollution on the glow of gold
 iske liye pradooshan maapak yantra lagane ke saath parisar ke aas-paas petrol-dijal gadiyon ke aane par bhi roak lagaai gai he
 a few days before the first phase of the general elections, in the spring of last year, a senior BJP BJP strategist was asked to submit a ground report to Amit Shah
 shah tab uttar pradesh ke chunaav prabharee the
 The Bihar leader said in a somewhat philosophical way, "if we want, we should be happy to think and pat ourselves that we have left no stone unturned to secure our vote
" lekin badi sachaai yahi he ki log pehle hi tay kar chuke hai ki kise vot dena he or vah naam he narendra modi
 "but fifteen months is a long time in politics and who knows it better than Shah
 yaa phir unke dhur virdohi nitish kumaar ko iskaa ehsaas ho saktaa he, jinke liye rajya kaa aglaa vidhansabha chunaav “karo yaa maro” ke maukey jaisaa he kyonki chunavi raajnneeti kaa sansar anishchayon se bharaa padaa he
 Thirteen months ago, Shah reached a height of his career whose example is not found
 modi ko loksabhaa main spasht bahumat mil gaya tha
 In Bihar, BJP won 31 out of 40 Lok Sabha seats
 nitish kumaar kii party kaa supada saaf ho gaya tha or unhone mukhyamantri pad se istipha de diya tha
 Shah is now the national president of the BJP
 ve 11 june ko patna main party ke bihar prabharee anant kumaar or unki team ke saath baithak kar rahe the
 He was then to meet former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, who was succeeded by Nitish but was removed after nine months
 shah ke saamne kai tarah ke sawaal khadey the ki bihar main aaj party kii kya sthiti he
 After 11 days, when Shah returned to take stock again, not much had changed
 haalanki ve ek din pehle shahar main antarrashtriya yoga diwas ke aayojan kii aguai karke kuch tarotaaja ho gaye the or apane swaabhaavik andaaj main dikh to rahe the par unamem puraane vishwaas kaa bhav gaayab tha
 a BJP strategist who attended the meeting that day says, "there is a long time in politics throughout the year
" jamini sthitiyaan badal chuki hai
 “the saffron party's chariot came to a standstill due to the bjp's debacle in Delhi and the record of Shah's victorious campaign came to an end
 phir, khaskar donon dhur virodhiyon lalu prasad yadav or nitish kumaar ke haath milaane ke baad bijepi ko bhaleebhanti maaloom he ki thodaa bhi aalas uske liye baari pad saktaa he
 It may not be good news for him that the senior leader who had influence in the upper caste Bhumihars c
 pi
 Thakur and his allies rose as the chief ministerial candidate in the name of Rashtriya Lok Samata Party chief and Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha
 haalanki bhagava kheme main in donon ke daawey ko koi gambhirtha se nahin le rahaa
 The leaders of the party realize that this is a stalking pressure on their part
 thakur jahaan apane bete ko tikat dilaanaa chaah rahe hai to kushvaha apni party ke liye zyada se zyada siten hasil karnaa chaahate hai
 BJP strategists realize that the Congress, Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Nitish Kumar's JD (U) got 45 in the general elections
 06 pratishat vot bijepi ko mili 36
 There are significantly more than 48 percent of the vote
 phir, modi lahar bhi khatm ho chuki he
 In such an informal conversation, many BJP leaders are not evaluating the party's prospects better
 lekin vot pratishat ke in aankadon ke saath ek duusari sachaai bhi he
 The simple arithmetic itself says that if the Lok Sabha trend is repeated in the assembly elections also, the Janata Parivar and Congress alliance will easily get majority, but the general rationale also says that the votes are not so easily transferred outright
 isliye isaki sambhaavna kam hi he ki jedy(you) ke paramparaagat voter apane kshetra main argedy ke ummidavaaron ke paksh main batan dabaaenge yaa argedy ke voter jedy(you) ummidavaaron kii ore jhuk jaaenge
 In such a situation, 4 to 5 percent of voters may have opposite trends or not casting their vote, may result in different kind of results and increase the chances of BJP
 isi vajah se bihar ke bijepi netaaon kii ranneeti in donon partiyon ke “andruni virodhabhaason” ke saath khilne kii he jo kisi nek iraade kii bajaae apane astitv kii raksha kii khatir ek saath aa gaye hai
 That is why the BJP is focusing first on the 90 seats on which the RJD and JD (U) candidates contested against each other in the 2010 assembly elections
 us samay jedy(you) endie main hua karata tha
 Now, if Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar are united, they will have to refuse to give tickets to any of the candidates who have won or lost in these seats
 bijepi kii yojana inhen ummidavaaron ko shah dekar khadaa karne kii he, taaki ve janata parivaar ke saajha ummidavaar ke vot kaat saken
 The BJP sees a lot of potential in these seats
 bijepi ke ek ranneetikaar kehete hai, “koi bhi raajnneeti main tyaag nahin karata
 Leaders who have been waiting for elections for five years, they will not go away from the electoral fray just because Lalu Yadav or Nitish Kumar want
 ve baagi ban jaaenge or hamen ummid he ki ye 90 baagi kaaphi vot kaat lenge
 They may not register victories, but can prove to be helpful in winning BJP candidates
 ” bijepi lalu-nitish ke vot bank main send lagane ke liye pappu yadav jaise netaaon kii peeth par bhi apana haath rakh sakati he, jo chunavi jang main kareeb 50 ummidavaar utaar sakate hai
 Apart from this, the BJP is also preparing its workers to expose the "mismatched truths" of the lalu-nitish alliance
 jedy(you) kii matadaataaon kaa man jaanane ke liye rajyabar ke 40,000 gaanvon main jeepies se las kareeb 10,000 vaahan bhejne kii yojana he yah bijepi kii 2014 ke chunaavon kii ranneeti kii nakal hi he
 On the other hand, BJP has also planned to follow Nitish Kumar's strategy of 2010 elections
 yani vah lalu yadav or rabari devi raaj ke kathith “jangal raaj” ko ujagar karne kii ranneeti par focus karegi
 a Delhi leader, who reached Patna in Shah's war room, says, "we have discovered videos of the 1990s when murders, kidnappings and crimes were dominated
 ye video kai news channelon ke khajaane se nikaale gaye hai, jo us samay ke bihar kii bhayaavah tasviir pesh karte hai
 Like the Lok Sabha elections, we will again send 250 campaign vehicles in all 243 assembly constituencies, which will spread the message that Lalu Yadav and Good Governance (nitish's slogan) are completely opposite
 ” is maamle main 35 varshiya rituraj sinha bade kaam ke sabit honge
 Sinha, who has been working behind the scenes to handle the publicity system, has studied at Doon School and Leeds University Business School and will oversee the bjp's war room
 is prachaar vyavastha main har kshetra main video rath bhejnaa or uski report hasil karnaa shaamil he
 In it, the icing on gold will do a 2010 video of Nitish Kumar in which he openly attacked Lalu Yadav and his "terror Raj"
 ek vakt nitish kumaar kii sarkaar main up-mukhyamantri rahe or rajya main bijepi ke kaddavar netaa susheel kumaar modi kehete hai, “lalu yadav ke kandhe par baithkar nitish kumaar bihar main aparaadh ko kaabo main nahin kar sakate
 "the support base of Janata Parivar in caste-based electoral politics of Bihar seems to be invincible on paper
 iske vipareet bijepi kaa samarthan aadhaar oonchi jatiyon, baniyon or kuch pichhadi jatiyon ke alaava lok janashakti party ke ramvilas paswan ke laae dalit voton tak hi simit he
 BJP is expecting a miracle from them by bringing Jitan Ram Manjhi in its court
 bihar kii 16 pratishat dalit jatiyon main se 5-6 pratishat musaharon main maanjhi kii paith bataai jaati he
 The Mushar caste is the third most populous caste in Bihar
 aise main keval amit shah or nitish kumaar ko hi nahin, bihar se sabko ummiden hai isliye daanv kaaphi oonche hai
 And this political game has just started
 jiesti conklev ke tisare satr main arthshaastri auki niti ayog ke sadsy bibek debroy ne desh ke sabase bade aarthik sudhaar kaarykram par apni raay rakhi
 The session was moderated by Business Today senior journalist Rajiv Dubey
 niti ayog ke sadsy bivek debaroy ne kaha ki bharat duniya kii pehla federell desh he jo jiesti lagu kar rahaa he
 According to Debroy, there should be a direct tax on goods, not an indirect tax
 iske chalate kai chijen jiesti se baahar hai
 It is a new type of GST, but if we could have implemented the GST that we had dreamed of, then the economy would have benefited more
 jiesti lagu hone ke baad desh ko yadi iskaa phayda hoga to saath hi use kuch nuksaan ke liye taiyaar rahane kii jarurat he
 GST has been discussed for 17 years, many timesline has been made for this, but it is now being implemented
 unhone kaha ki ye ek achche kadam kii shuruyaat he
 If we had waited for the ideal GST, it would have taken another 17 years
 debaroy ne kaha ki jiesti ko lagu karne main har party ek baat par sahamat hui he,jiesti councilane bhi is par kaaphi kaam kiya he
 Council will also have to meet continuously so that it can run smoothly
 haalanki debaroy ke mutabik jiesti kaa turant koi phayda nahin milane vaala
 For this we will have to wait a long time
 bivek debaroy ne daawa kiya ki duniya ke jin deshon main jiesti lagu kiya gaya vahaan shuruaati dinon main manhagaai badi he
 There is hope in India as well and in some sectors we will also see the effect of inflation
 haalanki kuch sector main manhagaai kaa asar nahin bhi dekhne ko milegaa
 But it is certain that after the implementation of GST, there is a danger of rising inflation for some time

 varsh 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main icchaanusaar kamyaabi na milane ke baad se unhone bhaichara cametiyon ko bhang kar diya tha, jabaki samaajawaadee party ne brahman sammelan karne shuru kiye the or 'pramotion main aarakshan' ke bispi ke kadam kaa virodh kiya tha
 
 
 By the way, traditionally the Brahmins of the state have been supporting the Congress, but as the strength of the Congress weakened, these votes went first with BJP and later with SP and BSP
 
 
 kamalapati treepathi ke saath congress kii pahchaan brahmanon se judi thi, or vahiin, atal bihari vaajapeyi ke baad bijepi rajya main majubat brahman cheharaa nahin talash pai
 
 
 BJP had two powerful faces of backward-backward society in the state as Vajpayee and Kalyan Singh, and on the basis of this, the party performed brilliantly in the '90s, but the rebellion of Kalyan Singh caused the BJP to lose in the state , She is yet to make up for it
 
 
 ab kalyaan singh ek baar phir bijepi main hai
 
 
 In all the Narendra Modi rallies held in the state, he gets a special place on the stage, but now he does not have that charisma
 
 
 duusari ore, atal bihari vaajapeyi ke saath rajya ke brahman netritv main gine jane vaale murali manohar joshi, calraj mishra or kesharinath treepathi jaise netaa ab umradraj maane jane lage hai or rajya kii raajnneeti main unki pakad dhire-dhire kamjor ho gai he
 
 
 It is different that now a new plant of Brahmin leadership in BJP has been ready, but the void born after Atal Bihari Vajpayee remains intact
 
 
 udhar, brahmanon ko saath lene kii bijepi kii koshishon ko murali manohar joshi, calraj mishra or kesharinath treepathi jaise netaaon kii naaraazgi se jhatka laga he
 
 
 All these three leaders are contesting elections from Banaras, Kanpur and Allahabad respectively, while the BJP is giving tickets to Narendra Modi from Banaras, Joshi from Kanpur and Kalraj Mishra from Shravasti
 
 
 kesharinath treepathi do vidhansabha chunaav haar chuke hai, or aise main party unhen tikat dene ke mood main nahin hai
 
 
 The BJP is also seeking to field new Brahmin faces from several seats
 
 
 narendra modi ke kareebi in chehron ke jariye party rajya main brahman netritv kii nai paudh ko majboot karnaa chaahati he
 
 
 It is being said that the favorable atmosphere this time to strengthen BJP again in Uttar Pradesh has never been the same since 1998
 
 
 tamaam janamat surveykshanon main bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki bijepi sabase badi party ke rup main ubhar sakati he
 
 
 Some surveys have also stated that the forward castes are being mobilized in favor of the BJP, but in reality this will only happen if the party takes care in the selection of candidates
 
 
 upi-bihar ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki chunaav se pehle chaahe jis party kii hawa ho, lekin nateezon ke bare main andaaza tabhi lagaana thik hota he, jab sabhi partiyon ke ummidavaaron ke naamon kaa elaan ho jaae

 aapaki nitiyon ne kisaanon ko jis badtar sthiti main khadaa kiya usase unako baahar nikaalane kii eemaandaar koshish modi ji kar rahe hai or ham isamen kaamyaab bhi ho rahe hai
 Some people, including you, cannot bear to become Prime Minister of Modiji, so you dream of intolerance and attack on constitutional institutions

 Your maneuvers are not working
 modiji phir pradhanmantri banenge or ham majbootee ke saath desh ko aage badhayenge
 However, you hope that you will behave wisely and responsibly in future
 aapako bataa den ki hindi pattee ke teen rajyon main bijepi kii haar ke baad bhi kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ke bayaan ko lekar vivaad khadaa ho gaya tha
 Addressing a program of co-operative bank personnel in Pune, Gadkari had said that the committee sits to review the debacle in politics, but when victory is won, no one is going to ask
 kyonki safalataa kaa shrey lene ke liye logon main hode rahati he, lekin vifaltaa ko koi sweekaar nahin karnaa chahta, sab duusare kii taraf ungali dikhaane lagate hai
 However, later Union Minister Nitin Gadkari while clarifying his statement said that he tried to say that the bank's leadership leadership takes credit if it comes to profit
 vaise hi agar bank yaa bijness ghate main chalaa jaataa he to uski jimmedaari bhi bank ke leadership ko leni chahie
 Let us tell you that on the occasion of Republic Day, the picture of Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Union Minister Nitin Gadkari talking together in the first line was shared on social media

 Our hashtag on Twitter is # realfinal
 ye kareeb-kareeb usee tarah tha ki pakistan ko haraana hamaare liye vishwa cap jeetne jaisaa tha
 Some social media comments, television and morning newspaper coverage appear to be inspired by some extreme nationalism, which makes us realize that even today we consider ourselves to be compared to our ever-present 'enemy' and not as a cup winner On
 bilkul hamaare paas khush hone ke har kaaran maujuud hai lekin ye bhi sahi he ki ye world cap par kabja banaae rakhane ke abhiyaan kaa pehla kadam hi he maatr

 takreeban teen maheene tak suraag ke liye desh kaa konaa-konaa chaanane ke baad bengalooru police ne shahar ke carch street main hue bam dhamaake kii jaanch se peeche hatane kaa faisla kiya he, kyonki police ke haath ab tak koi thos suraag nahin lage hai
 On December 28, 2014, a woman was killed and half a dozen people were injured in the blast at the gate of a restaurant on Church Street in the late evening at around 8
30 pm
 enesji or enie kii forensik tiimon ne mauka-e-vaardaat se saboot ikattha to kiye, lekin aisa suraag dhundne main naakaam raheen, jo is dhamaake ke liye zimmedaar aatankiyon tak agenciyon ko pahunchaa sake
 In such a situation, the police has urged the government to hand over the investigation of the Church Street blast to the NIA
 bengalooru ke police kamishnar emen reddy ne jaankaree di ki rajya ke grih mantralay se notification kaa intjaar he, iske baad jaanch ko enie ke supurd kar diya jayega
 The next Lok Sabha elections are now just a few months away
 iskaa asar swatantraaa diwas ke jashn par bhi dikh rahaa he
 Its echo was heard from the Red Fort in Delhi to Lalan College in Bhuj
 narendra modi ne buudhvaar ko pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko chunauti di thi ki swatantraaa diwas ke maukey par log do bhaashan sunenge or phir uski tulana hogi
 Something similar happened, first the PM addressed the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort
 iske kuch der baad hi modi ne bhuj ke laalan college se piem ke bhaashan kii dhajjiyaan udayi
 The Prime Minister in his speech highlighted the achievements of the UPA and said that the distance has been decided but the floor is far away
 vahiin, modi kaa swatantraaa diwas sambodhan puri tarah se raajnneetik tha
 In which the PM and Congress party were directly attacked on issues like corruption, poverty and inflation
 ek taraf jahaan pradhanmantri kaa bhaashan 35 minute kaa tha to modi kaa bhaashan kariban 55 minute tak chalaa
 The pm's speech had a glimpse of the person sitting in a responsible post, while Modi's speech had a churn for the future PM
 pakistan or anya padosi mulkmanmohan singhppadosi mulk ko kadaa sandesh dete hue piem manmohan singh ne kaha ki sambandh sudhaarney ke liye padosi desh se ho rahi bharat virdohi gatividhiyaan band kerani hongi, saath hi jor dekar kaha ki niyantran rekha par haal hi main javaanon kii hatya jaisi kyrana harakat ko rokane ke liye sabhi kadam uthaaye jaaenge
 The PM made no mention of Chinese incursions in his speech
 narendra modithpiem ne bhale kade shabdon main pakistan kii ninda kii ho par gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne ise naakaafi qaraar diya
 He said, "in view of international relations, what should be the language of the Prime Minister's level, i understand
 lekin sena kaa hausala buland ho iske liye desh piem se thodi kadi bhashaa kii apeksha karata he
 The Red Fort is the best place to boost the morale of the country's army

 Under this, 81 crore Indians will be able to get Rs 3 per kg of rice, Rs 2 per kg of wheat and Rs 1 per kg of coarse grains
 yah duniya bhar main is tarah kaa sabase bada prayaas he
 Narendra Modi: With the food security bill filling the PM, what is new in this? Already in many states, the poor are getting rice at Rs 3 per kg
 sachai to yah he ki yah bill garibon kii thali se anaaj chhinane kaa kaam karegi
 Earlier people living below the poverty line used to get 35 kg of food grains in a month, but now they will get only 25 kg of food grains

 ’narendra modithgujrat ke mukhyamantri ne pradhanmantri par uttarakhand tabaahi main anya rajyon dwaara kiye gaye sahyog kaa zikr karne naa karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 He said, you are addressing the country from the Red Fort
 par uttarakhand traasadee main kii gai madad ke liye desh kii janata ko shrey nahin dete hai
 All states helped Uttarakhand to the best of their ability
 par unke liye aap ek shabd nahin bolte ho
 Communalism and minority empowerment Manmohan Singh: Strangulation and communal thought will weaken democracy and the country and such ideas should be stopped from flourishing
 ek aadhunik pragatisheel or dharmanirpeksh desh main tang or sampradayik khyaalon kii koi gunjaaish nahin ho sakati
 Such thinking divides our society and weakens our democracy
 hamen ise rokna hoga
 Narendra Modi: The Chief Minister of Gujarat did not say anything about communal and secularism
 par apni puraani baat ko doharaaya ki rajaneta kaa ek maatr dharm desh hota he or desh kaa samvidhan uske liye dharmik granth
 Film Name: tubelightdirector: Kabir khanstar Cast: Salman Khan, Sohail Khan, Juju, Matin Ray Tangu, Om Puri, Shah Rukh Khan, Mohammad Zeeshan Ayub Duration: 2 hours 16 minutescertification: u Rating: 2
 5 stardiarector kabir khan or salmaan khan ekasaath film tiger or bajrangi bhai jaan lekar aa chuke hai
 Now the pair have made a third film called 'tubelight'
 is baar kabir khan ne hollywood kii film 'little boy' se prerit hokar is film kii kahani parde par darshane kii koshish kii he
 Although the Hollywood film 'little Boy' was not much appreciated, but it is expected to find something special in its Hindi adaptation
 kabir khan kii is film ko kya utana hi pyaar milegaa jitna ki unki salmaan khan ke saath ai pichhali filmon ko mila? is sawaal kaa jawaab jaanane ke liye aaiye jaane, film kisi bani he
 'tubelight' to be released on 5550 screens, Salmanakahani, who became 'baahubali' at the box office, is the story of Laxman (salman Khan) who is called by the children of the neighborhood
 lakshmana kaa bhai bharat (sohail khan) he
 Bharat and Laxman are everything to each other in a way because these parents died in childhood
 donon bhai ek duusare ke saath hi bade hote hai
 The emotional moment in the story comes when Bharata gets employed in the army and has to go for the indo-china war with no hope of returning
 lakshmana puri tareeke se bhavuk ho jaataa he or uski bharpoor koshish hoti he ki kisi bhi keemat par vah apane bhai ko waapas laa sake jiske liye lakshmana kii jarney shuru hoti he
 The story draws a lot of twists and turns from the entry of Banne Khan (om Puri) and young child Guo (matin) and her mother (joo Ju)
 lekin lakshmana ko yakeen rahata he ki uskaa bhai bharat jarur waapas aayega
 Now, to know whether his belief can be turned into reality, you will have to watch the film
 radio or naach meri jaan ke baad tubalite kaa imotional gaanaa tinkaa tinkaa relijakyon dekh sakate hai film- salmaan khan pehali baar ek machoman ke avatar se hatakar baikfoot par khelte najar aae hai or unka yah avatar aapane shaayad hi pehle dekha hoga yaa kah sakate hai ki pehali baar fresh avatar main dikhaai dete hai
 - The story of the film has already been told in the trailer but Kabir has tried to present his filming method in a different way, in which you mostly get emotional atmosphere
 - film ke interval se pehle or interval ke baad kahani alag-alag dishaao main jaati rahati he jahaan ek taraf salmaan kii soch interval se pehle ek maasoom se chote bachche kii tarah hoti he jisaki vajah se unhen tubalite kaha jaataa he vahi kahani ke duusare hisse main us soch main badlaav aata he
 - Salman Khan has done a great job in the film, the work of late actor Ompuri is also a great compliment
 bal kalakaar matin re tangu ne badhiya kaam kiya he jo aap ko samay-samay par hansaate bhi hai
 Sohail Khan and Chinese actress Juju have also acted spontaneously
 shahrukh khan kaa chota lekin kaaphi importeint role he
 salman-sohail's BHAIHOOD - The music of the film was seen in Tubelight's new song Nach Meri Jaan before the release and especially the radio and tinka-tinka song became very popular
 - film kaa diarection cinemetography loketions kamaal ke hai
 Although the film is based in the sixties, but it also acts as an eye-opener on many issues, which are still visible in front of everyone nowadays
 kamazor kadiyaan- film kii kamjor kadi isaki kahani he jo kii hollywood kii film little boy se prerit he or jin logon ne us film ko dekha he unke liye yah kam sarprice karne vaali film hogi
 Salman Khan's name appears in front of you in front of you, Dabangg Khan, Sultan and the person doing the action is seen, but you will not see all these things in this film
 - film kaa screenple bhi kaaphi bikharaa-bikharaa sa najar aata he jise bhalee bhaanti achche tareeke se pesh kiya jaataa to kahani kisi or level kii hoti
 The film has a good thinking but the makers seem unable to show it in its entirety
 - film kaaphi imotional he lekin kai baar aise kai seen aate hai jisamen imoshan to hota he lekin imotional feel ek darshak ke taur par mahasoos nahin hoti, jis par kaam kiya janaa bahut jaruri tha
 - The climax of the film is quite predictable, which would have been fun to watch if made more interesting
 box offissalmaan khan or id kaa combo pack bahut hi femes ho chalaa he jisaki vajah se film ko behtareen opening hameshaa milti ai he
 While Salman Khan's film Dabangg and Bodyguard entered the 100 crore club, films like Tiger, Kick and Sultan crossed the 200 crore mark, Hath Bajrangi Bhaijaan also surpassed the 300 crore mark

 Operation Blue Star and Bhindranwale's genie have come out of the bottle once again in Punjab
 is baar oparation blue star or bhindrawaale ke naam par raajnneeti tab ho rahi he jab sikhon kii sarvocch sanstha shiromani gurudwara prabandhak cameti amritsar ke harminder sahib main oparation blue star kii yaad main banaae ja rahe ek museum main un tamaam logon kii tasviren laga rahi he joki is oparation ke dauraan maare gaye the
 But most of the controversy is about the picture of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale who was killed during Operation Blue Star
 darasal, esajipisi ne ye tay kiya he ki blue star oparation kii yaad main banaae ja rahe museum main bhindrawaale kii tasviir lagaai jaaegi or ye baat punjab kii congress sarkaar ko nagavar guzar rahi he
 Capt Amarinder Singh said that it is not permissible for the SGPC to place a picture of terrorist Bhindranwale killed in Operation Blue Star in the museum to be built in Harmandir Sahib's premises
 captain amarinder singh ne esajipisi ko akali dal ke haathon kii kathputli bataate hue kaha ki jab bhi akali dal satta se baahar hota he to wo radical grups ke saath milakar punjab kaa maahaul bigaadane ke liye is tarah kii harakatein karata rahata he
 This will disturb the peace of Punjab: Captain Amarinder Singh, Chief Minister, Punjab, when the Akali Dal was in power, they did not try to do anything like this in the last 10 years and neither did such thing done by SGPC
 lekin, ab jaise hi ye log satta se baahar hue hai ye apane ishaare par esajipisi se ye sab kuch karvaa rahe hai
 i would like to ask Parkash Singh Badal what is the need to do all this
 aisa sab karne se punjab kii aman shanti bhang hogi
 Nothing else is going to be achieved
 akali dal ne is puure maamle main ghuma-phiraa kar jawaab dete hue kaha ki esajipisi sikhon kii sarvocch sanstha he or uske kaamkaaj main kisi kaa bhi dakhal nahin he
 Why is Bhindranwale's picture being put there, the answer can also be given by SGPC itself
 akali dal ke pravaktaa jangvir singh ne kaha ki punjab main blue star oparation ke naam par aatankwaad laane kii jimmedaar congress he
 Now the same Congress is accusing the Akali Dal of having met with radical groups
 aam aadmi party ko bhi harmandir sahib main blue star oparation ke dauraan maare gaye logon kii yaadgaar main banaaen ja rahe museum or oparation main maare gaye logon kii tasviren lagane main kuch bhi galat najar nahin aa rahaa he
 Punjab's senior leader of Aam Aadmi Party, Sukhpal Khaira said that there is nothing wrong if a memorial museum for those killed in memory of the Blue Star operation is being celebrated at Harmandir Sahib
 haalanki bhindrawaale kii tasviir is museum main lagaae jane ko lekar puche gaye sawaal par unhone golmol jawaab diya
 He said, "during the Blue Star operation, excesses were done to the Sikhs and if a museum is being built in memory of this operation, then there is nothing wrong in it
" haalanki yahaan par kiski tasviir lagani he ye to esajipisi hi bataa saktaa he
 "in the midst of the ongoing politics about the Blue Star operation and Bhindranwale, Sikh for Justice, an organization of Sikhs working from the US and Canada in Punjab, made several large posters of" Referendum 2020 "to get a referendum to create a separate Khalistan
 Has been installed in the areas
 jiske baad punjab police ne kaarywahi karte hue is maamle main is sanstha se jude ek vyakti ko giraftaar kiya he
 It is alleged that Sikh for Justice is trying to spoil the atmosphere of Punjab in the name of "referendum 2020" in Punjab
 punjab police ne saaf kar diya ki is tarah se alag khalistaan banane kii maang karne waalon or punjab kaa maahaul bigaadane kii koshish karne vaale logon se sakhti se nipta jayega
 Blue Star Operation and Bhindranwale's name have often been used by political parties for their convenience and benefit
 ab ek baar phir harmandir sahib main bhindrawaale ke poster lagane ko lekar shuru hue vivaad par bhi jamkar raajnneeti ho rahi he
 But in the midst of this politics, nobody cares about the peace and tranquility of Punjab

 Not only did the film 'piku' succeed at the box office, but its character Piku was also very much discussed
 jis tarah deepika ne is role ko nibhaayaa, usamen unki kadi mehnat parade par saaf dikhi
 Deepika worked very hard to learn Bangla accent and also took training from teacher
 yahi vajah he ki bengal ke filmkaaron ko deepika kii acting khub pasand ai or ve apni filmon main deepika ko lenaa chaahate hai
 It is a different matter that Deepika has not accepted any Bengali film till now
 tippaniyan But do you know that Deepika will be ready to do a Bengali film in future? There is a lot of emphasis on experimental cinema in Bengal and Deepika also likes films and such challenging characters
 isaki misaal he film 'finding funni' jo apane aap main ek praayogic film thi or deepika kii bhoomika goan ladki kii thi
 For this, Deepika had also learned Govan language
 deepika kii film 'piku' bhi apane aap main regular filmon se alag thi
 In the film 'chennai Express', Deepika spoke Hindi in a South Indian language accent
 yahi nahin 'happy new year' main vah marathi lahaze main hindi bolti najar ain
 Deepika's accent in both these films was well received by the audience
 bangla lahaze ko seekhney ke liye deepika ne khaas mehnat kii or teacher se training bhi lee thi
 This is the reason that the filmmakers of Bengal liked Deepika's acting very much and they want to take Deepika in their films
 yah alag baat he ki deepika ne ab tak koi bengali film sweekaar nahin kii he
 The comments lekin kya pataa deepika bhavishya main koi bangla film karne ko taiyaar ho jaaen? bengal main experimental cinema par zyaada jor diya jaataa he or deepika ko bhi aisi filmein or aise chunauti bhare kirdaar pasand aate hai
 Its example is the film 'finding Funny' which was an experimental film in itself and Deepika's role as a Govan girl
 iske liye deepika ne goan bhashaa bhi sikhi thi
 Deepika's film 'piku' was also different from regular films in itself
 film 'chennai express' main deepika ne dakshin bhartiya bhashaa ke lahaze main hindi boli thi
 Not only this, she was seen speaking Hindi in Marathi accent in 'happy New Year'
 in donon filmon main deepika ke lahaze ko darshakon ne khub pasand kiya

 bihar main vipaksh main dikhaa rahaa bikharaavaek hi mudde par do din band kaa aahvananaagarikta kanoon or enarasi ke khilaaf bihar main do din kaa band rakhaa gaya he
 The first bandh is called by the Left parties on 19 December and the second by RJD on 21 December
 ab in donon din ke band ko mahagabandhan ke baaki dal samarthan denge
 It is clear that due to lack of solidarity in Bihar opposition to the bandh on the same issue, the people of Bihar will have to face a bandh for two days
 janata dal you kaa kahana he ki vipaksh main netaa banane ko lekar varchasv kii ladaai he, kyonki mahagathbandhan ke baaki dal tejasvi yadav ko netaa maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai or isi vajah se bihar kii janata ko do-do din band jhelana padegaa
 It is clear that opposition is divided on this bandh called for Citizenship Amendment Act and NRC
 araspi ke adhyaksh upendra kushvaha ne kaha ki wo ek hi din kaa band chaahate the lekin vam dalon or argedy ke bich sahmati nahin hone ke kaaran yah do dinon main bant gaya or ham donon din ke band kaa samarthan karenge
 Upendra Kushwaha said the reason Upendra Kushwaha said that the issue is one and everybody wants to oppose it but the program for 2 days has been announced separately
 ghoshnaa ke baad hamane communist party or argedy se bhi baat kii
 Congress, Manjhi ji Mukesh Sahni ji talked to everyone and everyone agreed that it would be good if Bihar is not closed for 2 days in a span of one day
 hamane khud bhi vyaktigat rup se pahal kii koshish kii
 Everyone tried together, but that effort was not successful
 ab aisi paristhiti main jane yaa anjaane vipaksh kii ekta ke khilaaf massej ja saktaa he
 Keeping this in mind, we have decided that the people of the Grand Alliance will also support the bandh on the 19th and will also support the bandh on the 21st
 press conference main argedy kaa koi netaa nahimband ko lekar mahagabandhan ke is press conference main argedy kaa koi netaa najar nahin aayaa balki isamen argedy ke pradesh adhyaksh jagatanand singh ko shaamil hona tha
 Kushwaha said that he had been invited by Jayaneyand Singh himself to come but did not know why
