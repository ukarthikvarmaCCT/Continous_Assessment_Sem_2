phir congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne hi karnataka ke har varg ke logon tak pahunchane ke liye ‘jan aashirwad yatra’ kaa vichaar diya
 The yatra also bridged the distance between leaders and activists
 saath hi adhik se adhik logon tak pahunchane ke lakshya ko bhi kaaphi had tak puraa kiya
 Apart from this, candidates also got the platform for their specific campaign

 Ever since activist 'king'rahul Gandhi took charge of the party as president, his message has been clear - the worker is now the king
 rahul ne karnataka main ab tak ke campagne ke dauraan kaaryakartaaon se zyada se zyada samvaad kiya or unhen prachaar kii ranneeti se bhi joda
 Many activists were also given party tickets
 14 sitting vidhayakon ke tikat kaate gaye
 At the same time, Congress leaders seeking tickets for relatives also received cold response from the party high command
 karnataka ke liye congress ke mahasachiv incharge ke si venugopal ne india today se kaha, ‘rahul gandhi kaa party kaaryakartaonke liye sandesh ahm he
 Ticket distribution for Karnataka is the result of a collective effort and a big incentive for the party cadre

 Regional Leadership Like Karnataka, regional leadership has been given great importance in Karnataka
 rahul gandhi ke netritv main or siddharmaiya kii salaah se block-district se lekar rajya str par sabhi netaaon ko chunaav prakriya se joda gaya
 After the change in party leadership in many states, Congress leaders say Kirahul Gandhihi wants the central leaders of the party and state level leaders to go shoulder to shoulder
 iske alaava party netaa or kaaryakarta nijee str par bhi logon se sampark badhaaen
 According to sources, even in the states where elections are to be held, the leaders are also keen to replicate Rahul's travel model
 kaaryakartaaon or kshetreey chehron ko praathamikta dene ke peeche yahi sandesh dene kii kavayad he ki rahul kii congress pehle kii congress se alag he
 It is said that people in the world do all the hard work for the stomach
 ye kahani bhi pet kii he
 But a little different
 hatakar isliye kyonki yahaan pet ke liye pet ko hi daanv par laga diya jaataa he
 Imagine aapse koi aisa shaks takaraa jaae jo pet main pachaas-sau sabutcapsulaliye gum rahaa ho to use aap kya kahenge? ye kahani karodon rupee ke aise hi pet kii he
 a man in a closed room away from the eyes of the world is busy preparing something like a capsule
 wo ek-ek kar plastic or rabar kii choti-choti theliyon main koi powder bharta he or phir unhen candal kii lau main garm karte hue sil kar kinare rakhata jaataa he
 Now the capsule is ready and it's time to eat them
 lekin iske liye pani yaa kisi drink kii madad nahin leni he balki capsule ko ek khaas tarah ke solution main dubone ke baad sidhe halak se neeche utaar lenaa he
 More than 24 hours have passed since this capsule was made to eat and to remove it under the circles, but the inner picture of her stomach is still exactly the same as it was immediately after swallowing them
 yani naa to ye capsule uske pet main ghul rahe hai or naa hi isamen rakhi dawa kaa us shaks par koi asar hi ho rahaa he
 In such a situation, the question arises that after all why has this person filled his stomach with so many capsul? The story ahead of making secret capsules and carrying them in such a way is as mysterious as it is
 kyonki un capsule main naa to koi dawa bhari he or naa hi ye shaks apana ilaaj hi kar rahaa he
 The truth is that every capsule made in this way is full of poison
 sawaal yah he ki jab ek capsule ke fatne se hi inhen nigalane vaale shaks kii jaan ja sakati he, to phir ye shaks is tarah ek-ek kar das, bees, tees, chalis, pachaas yaa phir usase bhi zyada capsule se kyon apana pet bhar rahaa he?darasal jehar bhare is ek-ek capsule kii keemat lakhon rupee he
 That is, crores of rupees are filled in the stomach of that person
 ek khufia jaankarinarkotics control beuro ko khabar milti he ki dilli ke indira gandhi international airport par ek shaks bahut keemtee cheez lekar aane vaala he
 a trap is laid at the airport
 wo shaks aata he or use pakad bhi liya jaataa he
 But despite all the searches, nothing is found from him
 aakhir main ye maan kar ki shaayad khabar galat thi afasar use chhodane kaa faisla kar lete hai
 But before that they offer him tea-coffee and some food
 wo manaa kar detaa he or bas yaheen par afasaron ke kaan khadey ho jate hai
 Actually, the etiquette behind the offer of water and coffee to him was less and the move of NCB officers was more
 aisi chaal jise wo aksar aise swalvers ko chit karne ke liye aajamaate rahe hai
 Solorants who usually secrete drugs such as cocaine or heroin in the stomach avoid drinking anything before taking them out
 is shaks ke saath bhi aisa hi he
 On medical examination, it is clear that this man named Bobby Collins of Afikri origin has hidden cocaine worth about six and a half crores in the stomach in the form of 65 capsules
 ye pehla mauka nahin he jab apane pet main karodon rupee kaa nasha chhupaakar koi hindustan pahunchaa
 Even before this, many foreigners have been caught red-handed by the Narcotics Bureau
 ganimat yahi rahi ki is baar pet main chupe capsule main se koi fata nahin
 It has been seen many times that even before reaching India, a capsule full of cocaine burst and Carrier died

 The United Nations has approved his proposal to celebrate International Yoga Day
 ab har saal 21 june ko vishwa antarrashtriya yoga diwas ke taur par manaaya jayega
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed happiness over the acceptance of India-led proposal to declare June 21 as 'international Yoga Day' at the United Nations General Assembly

 i welcome this decision
 unhone kaha, main duniya bhar ke un sabhi 177 deshon ko dhanyavad detaa hum, jinhone 21 june ko antarrashtriya yoga diwas ghoshit karne ke liye prastaav ko sah-pryojit kiya
 The Prime Minister said that countless people all over the world have made yoga an integral part of their lives
 un sabhi ko badhai, isse badi sankhya main log yoga ko lekar prerit honge
 He said, Yoga has the potential to bring the whole human society together
 yah gyaan, karm or bhakthi kaa behad sundar sangam he

 In presenting this proposal, Mukherjee quoted Modi's speech at the United Nations General Assembly
 bhaashan main modi ne vishwa netaaon se ek antarrashtriya yoga diwas ke liye manjuuri dene kaa aahvaan karte hue kaha tha ki jivan style main badlaav or chetana jaagrath karne par jalwaayu parivartan kaa saamana karne main madad mil sakati he
 Modi had said, Yoga is a confluence of harmony between mind and body, thoughts and action, sobriety and wholeness, human and nature, it provides overall initiative for health and well-being
 21 june ko antarrashtriya yoga diwas manaane ke suzav main modi ne kaha tha ki yah vah taarikh he, jab uttari dhruv main din kii avadhi sabase lambii hoti he or duniya ke kai hisson main yah din mahatvapurn mana jaataa he
 Mukherjee said that only a few countries initially supported the idea that the Prime Minister had presented

 vahiin 2014 tak japan main hone vaale kul tranjaction main 80 fisadi hissaa cash kaa tha
 There is also a card, but in Cash is King's Cash system it is not that plastic money or cashless card is not present
 japan ne sabase pehle credit card kaa istemaal 1960 main kiya tha jab maaruti departmental store ne kharidari ke liye graahakon ko yah card jari kiya tha
 Today there are about 32 crore such credit cards in Japan, that is three credit cards per adult
 antarrashtriya plastic mani company master card ke mutabik aaj bhi japan main 38 fisadi se zyada tranjaction cash main hota he
 This is five times the cash transaction in France
 vahiin america main 20 fisadi or england main mahaj 11 fisadi cash tranjaction hota he
 After all, the biggest argument behind the trend of 'cash is King' Cash in Japan is that it is the safest medium
 japan main chori, chhinachapati or dakaiti na ke baraabar he
 People are not afraid to walk here carrying a lot of cash in their pockets or bags
 alam yah he ki yadi paison se bharaa aapkaa purse kahin gir jaae to bas intjaar kiijie, koi na koi jald use aapke pate par pahunchaa degaa or purse main pataa yaa idi na hone kii surat main najdiki police stesan par vah nishchit mil jayega
 Small shopkeepers are compelled Cashcash's second importance is due to the small grocery stores and food shops across the country
 ye chote or majhole dukandaar bainkon dwaara jari credit or debit card ke madhyam se tranjaction par fees kii sharton par taiyaar nahin ho pate, lihaaja vah in madhyamon ko puri tarah se nikaar dete hai
 Apart from this, such shopkeepers get another big benefit in the form of savings in income tax as they usually pay the loss of return in business every year
 lekin unki sankhya itani badi he ki sarkaar inakam tex thopane se kataraati he
 At the forefront of ATM technology, Japan is the world's leading country in terms of technology
 technology kii dhamak japan ke sabhi bade shaharon main saaf taur par dekhi ja sakati he
 As a result of this, atms of banks present in the big cities of the country, including the capital of Japan, give cash and exchange notes and coins, along with giving cash
 aapako yadi kisi dukandaar ko paise adaa karne hon, swaabhaavik he ki vah cash kii ummid karegaa, or aapke paas sirf debit yaa credit card he
 So there is no problem because you can remove notes and coins from your card from any ATM
 yadi aapke paas paise sirf note main hai to aap atm se muft main sikkon main footkar praapt kar sakate hai
 In addition to this, most ATM machines will also provide you with notes and all these arrangements are free because Cash is King in Japan
 ab aap hi bataaen jab japan apni saikadon saal puraani arthvyavastha ko bina badale chalaa saktaa he to kya pradhanmantri modi ko notebandi ke faisle ke baad turant kii japan yatra par yah hunar nahin siikhnaa tha
 Like the cities of Japan, the cities of India have become America and Europe
 haalanki shaharon se baahar nikalate hi jaise asli japan shuru hota he thik vaise hi bharat ke shaharon ke baahar gaanvon kaa asli bharat shuru hota he
 Modi ji, was it really necessary to implement the system of credit and debit lending by destroying the trust economy of thousands of years old villages with notes and coins? supreme court ke nae atirikt parisar kaa buudhvaar ko locarpan hua
 Now the decisions of the Supreme Court in nine regional languages will be translated
 12 acre me bane is parisar ko 20 lakh blox se banaaya gaya he
 These blocks are made from debris and other materials
 parisar ke locarpan samaaroh main raashtrapati ramnath kovind ne kaha ki 100 ahm faislon ke nau bhashaaon main anuwaad ab supreme court kii website par aa gaye hai
 This is an auspicious beginning
 aage bhi lebar, sampatti bantwaare jaise vivaadon ke janata se jude supreme or hycorts ke ahm faisle anuwaad hokar site par aaenge
 The President said that the original building of the Supreme Court was inaugurated by Rajendra Babu
 registry, librari, kanvension haal, sabhaagaar or record room hai jo kala ke utkrisht namoonay hai
 Its goal is solar energy, environment and water conservation
 nai shuruyaat ko kaaphi aage janaa he jisase janata ko jaldi or sateek nyaay mili
 At present there are 31 judges in the Supreme Court and in future the Collegium and the government will continue to work in mutual coordination
 kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne is maukey par kaha ki yah bhawan 931 karod kii laagat se bana he
 This building also shows the strength of Indian art
 sarkaar 7000 karod nae adaalat parisar or maujuud adaalaton ke buniyadi dhaanche ko sudhaarney ke liye kharch kar rahi he
 Even today the government has abolished 51 non-essential laws
 ab tak sarkaar ne 1500 puraane kanoon khatm kiye hai
 The government is also considering the All India Judicial Service
 supreme court ke chif justise ranjan gogoi ne kaha ki puraani imaarat kaa bhi aitihaasik or pratikatmak mahatv he
 The new building is also a state of the art
 supreme court har front par kaam karata he
 We have a commitment to justice and we cannot compromise on this
 sijeai ne kaha ki badlaav ke pankh lagaataar vaishvik paridrishy ko badal rahe hai
 Traditional methods of functioning at work places are changing
 hamen bhi badalanaa padegaa lekin dusron kii nakal se nahin, apane andaaj main apni jaruraton ke mutabik
 Aruna Shanbaug, who was bedridden for 42 years in Mumbai's King Edward Medical Hospital, finally broke her breath on Monday
 aruna shanbagh ke maamle ne 4 saal pehle achaanak jivan or nyaay se jude kuch buniyadi sawaalon kii taraf sabakaa dhyaan khinchaa tha, jab unki karunamrityu ke liye di gai yachika adaalat ne naamanzur kar di thi
 Then according to the logic that protected Aruna Shanbag, life is the holiest and priceless
 chaahe jis bhi haal main hon, aruna shanbagh lambey samay tak jivit raheen, or kam se kam is maamle main khushkismat ki lagaataar sarokaar shithil or samvednashunya ho rahi is duniya main unhen kuch aisi norsen milin, jo unki bekabari main bhi unki seva karne ko taiyaar raheen, unke jivan kii garima unako lautaati raheen
 Aruna Shanbag's case came before the Supreme Court when Pinki Virani, an author writing a book on Aruna's life, filed a petition demanding compassion for him
 aakhir yah koun-sa dabaav tha, jiske tahat pinki viraani ne yah kaam kiya? pinki viraani ne apni yachika main is baat kaa zikr kiya tha ki aruna shanbagh ek aisa jivan ji rahi hai, jisamen vah kuch bhi mahasoos or vyakt karne laayak nahin bachi hai
 To keep them alive is ultimately an anti-life or anti-human effort, because the meaning of life is when it can be felt and expressed
 ek tarah se dekhen to sarvocch nyaayalay ne aruna shanbagh ke tark se sahanubhuti dikhaai thi
 In his historical decision, he allowed indirect compassion
 paroksh karunamrityu kaa matlab yah hua ki kisi marij ko uski jivan rakshak pranali se dur kar diya jaae, ve sutara kaat die jaaen jo uske jivan ko kisi bhi paristhiti main bachaate hon
 That is, no medicine or needle can be given to a patient to pay compassionate or any active effort that can lead to his life
 haa, use bachaane kaa prayaas chhod dene se uski jaan chali jaae to yah paroksh karunamrityu he
 However, the decision to award such compassion to one cannot be done without the approval of the bench of at least two judges of the High Court and this bench would also have to take permission from a panel of at least three doctors
 yani adaalat ne apni taraf se yah andeshaa puri tarah khatm karne kii koshish kii he ki paroksh ichha mrityu se jude kanoon kaa koi durupyog na ho sake
 But is there still no such ongoing trend of death in our society? When a doctor suggests this tactic for an elderly and sick patient that they are no longer treated and they should be taken home, it is a decision of indirect euthanasia in the absence of any law so far
 She used to get up, there was no lawsuit
 ab kahana mushkil he, nae halaat main kya hoga
 However, why did the Supreme Court allow Aruna Shanbag to live still? The answer to this question can lead us to many useful conclusions
 adaalat ne paroksh karunamrityu ko kuch paristhitiyon main vaid bataate hue bhi agar aruna shanbagh ko is niyati se mukt rakhaa to bas isliye ki unka jivan chaahane vaali, use bachaae rakhane ke liye praytn karne or mukadmaa ladane ko taiyaar ek choti-si birdari thi
 That is, at one level we can say that collectivity and concern have a big contribution in protecting life
 mumbai ke king edward college aspataal kii nurson ne yah samuhikta dikhaai, yah sarokaar pradarshit kiya, isliye adaalat ko bhi aruna shanbagh ke anyathaa vyarth ho chuke jivan main itani garima dikhi ki usne unhen jeene laayak mana
 It is another matter that the sensitiveness in the circumstances of Aruna Shanbag, which was seen by the court of concern, was not seen by another sensitive woman Pinki Virani
 shaayad isliye ki pinki viraani aruna shanbagh ke jivan ko sirf aruna shanbagh tak simit karke dekh rahi thim
 She could not understand how many lives are involved in a life, how many relationships are broken by one death
 bhartiya sandarbhon main samuhikta ke is satya kaa ek bada mahatva he
 Despite all the pressures of socialism in this vast country, we are still left so much that we care about the lives of others - even if we have no blood relation with them
 shaayad yahi chiz he jisane kai tarah ke abhaavon ke bich, kai tarah kii jadtaaon ke bich bhi is samaaj ko bachaae rakhaa he
 But now this relationship is in danger, because this society is in danger
 gaanvon kii tuutan or shaharon kii sadaandh ke bich haal ke dinon main yah samuhikta kai staron par kshatigrast hui he or visthaapan or akelepan ke abhishaap jhel rahaa aadmi aatmahatya ko bhi vikalp kii tarah dekhne ko majaboor he
 It is not uncommon that the Supreme Court, in its judgment on Karunamruti, also referred to the law related to suicide and advocated that it should not be considered a crime
 vaise, aruna shanbagh ke is maamle ke ek duusare or ahm sire par hamaari nigaah nahin he
 42 years ago, Aruna suffered a cruel behavior
 isi vyavhaar ne unhen maansik taur par ek aisi sthaayee aapangata kii taraf dhakel diya, jisase vah apane antim samay tak ubar nahin pai
 She was a 22-year-old girl, now she has died at the age of 65
 bich ke 42 varsh sirf unke jism par ghate hai, unke man par unki koi chhap nahin padi
 On the other hand, the ward boy who had raped him by holding him in chains, got his share of punishment
 bataaya jaataa he ki saat saal kii jail bhugat kar vah dilli ke kisi aspataal main naukari karata rahaa or kuch arsa pehle uski maut hui
 In a way it can be said that he had served his sentence
 lekin kya us shaks ko kabhi apni ek raat kii vahshat ne jhakzora yaa siharaaya hoga? yaa phir vah kahin zyada dussahsee ho gaya hoga?tippaniyan However, whatever he may be, for Aruna Shanbag his life is not what he could have been
 yah puraa prasang bataata he ki ek jurm sirf ek sharir ke saath ek haadasa nahin hota, uske zakhm man par bhi padate hai or bahut dur tak padate hai
 The severity of a crime is also determined by the impact it has on a victim
 durbhaagya se yah lagata nahin he ki aruna shanbagh par chal rahe mukademe ke vaqt is baat kaa khyal rakhaa gaya hoga
 a routine court action led to a routine sentence and a person who was sentenced to life imprisonment for a few years was sentenced to a few years' imprisonment
 aruna shanbagh ke jivan kaa sabase bada sabak yahi he ki ek vahshat agar kisi ke jivan ko vyarth bana sakati he to kuch logon kaa saath use phir bhi jeene kii garima de saktaa he
 Aruna Shanbag's life may not have mattered to her, but it mattered to many people - to the nurses at King Edward College who protected her for 42 years
 vah is haal main 42 saal bachi rah gayi to bhi shaayad isiilie ki unki is tarah dekhbhaal kii gai
 There is also a message for us here - even though the law of compassion has become a law, we should consider life larger than this law and understand that the lives of others - right on the level of concern and memory - also include our lot
 aruna shanbagh kaa maamla tab sarvocch nyaayalay ke saamne aayaa jab aruna ke jivan par kitaab likh rahi ek lekhika pinki viraani ne ek yachika daayar kar unke liye karunamrityu kii maang kii
 After all, what was the pressure under which Pinki Virani did this work? Pinki Virani had mentioned in her petition that Aruna Shanbag is living a life in which she is left with nothing to feel and express
 unhen jivit rakhana antat ek jivan virdohi yaa manushya virdohi praytn he, kyonki jivan kii sarthakata tab he jab use mahasoos or vyakt kiya ja sake
 In a way, the Supreme Court was sympathetic to Aruna Shanbag's argument
 apane aitihaasik faisale main usne paroksh karunamrityu kii ijazat di thi
 Indirect Karunamruti means that a patient is removed from his life-saving system, those formulas should be cut which save his life under any circumstances
 yani kisi marij ko karunamrityu dene ke liye koi dawa yaa sooyee nahin di ja sakati yaa koi aisa sakriy prayaas nahin kiya ja saktaa, jisase uskaa jivan chalaa jaae
 Yes, if you give up trying to save her, then it is indirect compassion
 haalanki kisi ko aisi karunamrityu dene kaa faisalaa bhi ucch nyaayalay ke kam se kam do nyaayadhishon ke khandpeeth kii manjuuri ke bina nahin ho saktaa or is khandpeeth ko bhi kam se kam teen doctoron ke panel se isaki ijazat leni padi hogi
 That is, the court has tried to completely eliminate the fear that the law related to indirect desire death can not be misused
 lekin kya hamaare samaaj main ab bhi aisi paroksh ichha mrityu kaa chalan jari nahin he? jab koi doctor kisi bujurg or biimaar marij ke liye yah yukti sujhata he ki ab unka koi ilaaj nahin rahaa or unhen ghar hi le janaa chahie to yah ek tarah se paroksh ichhamrityu kaa hi faisla he jis par ab tak kisi kanoon ke abhaav main na ungali uthati thi, na mukadmaa hota tha
 It is difficult to say now, what will happen in the new situation
 baharhaal, supreme court ne aruna shanbagh ko phir bhi jeene kii ijazat kyon di thi? is sawaal kaa jawaab hamen kai upyogi nishkarshon tak pahunchaa saktaa he
 Even if Aruna Shanbaug was exempted from this destiny by the court, while declaring Indirect Karunamrutya as valid in some circumstances, it was a small community willing to try and defend her life to save her life
 yani ek str par ham kah sakate hai ki jivan kii raksha main samuhikta or sarokaar kaa bada yogadan hota he
 The nurses at King Edward College Hospital in Mumbai displayed this collectiveness, showing concern, so the court was also shown with so much dignity in Aruna Shanbag's otherwise wasted life that she considered them worth living
 yah alag baat he ki aruna shanbagh kii paristhitiyon main jo samvedansheeltaa, jo sarokaarasampannataa adaalat ne dekh lee, vah ek or samvedansheel mahila pinki viraani ko nazar nahin ai
 Probably because Pinky Virani was seeing Aruna Shanbag's life limited to Aruna Shanbag only
 vah yah nahin samaj paa rahi thim ki ek jivan main kitne jivan shaamil hote hai, ek maut se kitne rishte tuutate hai
 This truth of collectivity has a great significance in Indian contexts
 is vishaal desh main saamaajikta ke taar saare dabaavon ke baavjood ab tak itane bache hue hai ki ham dusron ke jivan kii parvaah karte hai- bhale unase hamaara koi khun kaa rishta na ho
 Perhaps this is the thing that has kept this society safe even in the midst of many deprivations, many inertia
 lekin ab yah sambandh khatare main he,kyonki yah samaaj khatare main he
 In the recent times between the breakdown of villages and the rot of cities, this collectivity has been damaged on many levels and a man facing the curse of displacement and loneliness is also forced to see suicide as an option
 yah anayas nahin he ki karunamrityu par apane faisle main sarvocch nyaayalay ne aatmahatya se jude kanoon kaa bhi zikr kiya tha or ise aparaadh na maanane kii vakaalat kii he
 By the way, we do not have a second and important point in this matter of Aruna Shanbag
 42 saal pehle aruna ek pashavik vyavhaar kii shikaar huin
 This behavior pushed her mentally towards a permanent disability, which she could not recover till her last time
 tab vah 22 saal kii ladki thim, ab kareeb 65 saal kii umr main unka dehanth hua he
 The 42 years in between have been reduced to his body only, he had no impression on his mind
 udhar, jis ward bvoy ne unhen chen se jakad kar unke saath dushkarm kiya tha, usne apane hisse kii sajaa kaat lee
 It is said that he continued to work in a hospital in Delhi after spending seven years in jail and died some time ago
 ek tarah se kaha ja saktaa he ki usne apni sajaa kaat lee thi
 But would that person have been shaken or trembled by one night's grief? Or would it have become more audacious? baharhaal, uskaa jo bhi ho, aruna shanbagh ke liye uskaa jivan vah nahin rah gaya jo vah ho saktaa tha
 This entire episode shows that a crime is not just an accident with a body, its wounds also fall on the mind and go far and wide
 kisi aparaadh kii gambhirtha is baat se bhi tay hoti he ki uskaa kisi peedit par kya asar padaa
 Unfortunately, it does not appear that this would have been taken care of during the ongoing trial on Aruna Shanbag
 ek routine adalati karrwai se ek routine kism kii sazaa nikali or ek shaks kii zindagi ko maut se bhi badtar bana dene vaala shaks kuch saal kii sajaa kaat kar bari ho gaya
 The biggest lesson in the life of Aruna Shanbag is that if a person can make someone's life meaningless, it can give some people the dignity to live with him
 aruna shanbagh kaa jivan unke liye bhale ahmiyat na rakhata rahaa ho, lekin vah bahut saare logon ke liye- king edward college kii un nurson ke liye, jinhone 42 saal tak unhen bachaae rakhaa - myne rakhata tha
 She may have survived 42 years in this situation even if she was cared for in this way
 yahaan ek sandesh hamaare liye bhi he- karunamrityu kaa kanoon bhale ban gaya ho, lekin jivan ko ham is kanoon se bada maane or yah samajhen ki dusron ke jivan main- sarokaar or smriti ke str par hi sahi- hamaara bhi bahut kuch shaamil he
 In a way, the Supreme Court was sympathetic to Aruna Shanbag's argument
 apane aitihaasik faisale main usne paroksh karunamrityu kii ijazat di thi

 There is also a message for us here - even though the law of compassion has become a law, we should consider life larger than this law and understand that the lives of others - right on the level of concern and memory - also include our lot
 baharhaal, supreme court ne aruna shanbagh ko phir bhi jeene kii ijazat kyon di thi? is sawaal kaa jawaab hamen kai upyogi nishkarshon tak pahunchaa saktaa he
 Even if Aruna Shanbaug was exempted from this destiny by the court, while declaring Indirect Karunamrutya as valid in some circumstances, it was a small community willing to try and defend her life to save her life
 yani ek str par ham kah sakate hai ki jivan kii raksha main samuhikta or sarokaar kaa bada yogadan hota he
 The nurses at King Edward College Hospital in Mumbai displayed this collectiveness, showing concern, so the court was also shown with so much dignity in Aruna Shanbag's otherwise wasted life that she considered them worth living
 yah alag baat he ki aruna shanbagh kii paristhitiyon main jo samvedansheeltaa, jo sarokaarasampannataa adaalat ne dekh lee, vah ek or samvedansheel mahila pinki viraani ko nazar nahin ai
 Probably because Pinky Virani was seeing Aruna Shanbag's life limited to Aruna Shanbag only
 vah yah nahin samaj paa rahi thim ki ek jivan main kitne jivan shaamil hote hai, ek maut se kitne rishte tuutate hai
 This truth of collectivity has a great significance in Indian contexts
 is vishaal desh main saamaajikta ke taar saare dabaavon ke baavjood ab tak itane bache hue hai ki ham dusron ke jivan kii parvaah karte hai- bhale unase hamaara koi khun kaa rishta na ho
 Perhaps this is the thing that has kept this society safe even in the midst of many deprivations, many inertia
 lekin ab yah sambandh khatare main he,kyonki yah samaaj khatare main he
 In the recent times between the breakdown of villages and the rot of cities, this collectivity has been damaged on many levels and a man facing the curse of displacement and loneliness is also forced to see suicide as an option
 yah anayas nahin he ki karunamrityu par apane faisle main sarvocch nyaayalay ne aatmahatya se jude kanoon kaa bhi zikr kiya tha or ise aparaadh na maanane kii vakaalat kii he
 By the way, we do not have a second and important point in this matter of Aruna Shanbag
 42 saal pehle aruna ek pashavik vyavhaar kii shikaar huin
 This behavior pushed her mentally towards a permanent disability, which she could not recover till her last time
 tab vah 22 saal kii ladki thim, ab kareeb 65 saal kii umr main unka dehanth hua he
 The 42 years in between have been reduced to his body only, he had no impression on his mind
 udhar, jis ward bvoy ne unhen chen se jakad kar unke saath dushkarm kiya tha, usne apane hisse kii sajaa kaat lee
 It is said that he continued to work in a hospital in Delhi after spending seven years in jail and died some time ago
 ek tarah se kaha ja saktaa he ki usne apni sajaa kaat lee thi
 But would that person have been shaken or trembled by one night's grief? Or would it have become more audacious? baharhaal, uskaa jo bhi ho, aruna shanbagh ke liye uskaa jivan vah nahin rah gaya jo vah ho saktaa tha
 This entire episode shows that a crime is not just an accident with a body, its wounds also fall on the mind and go far and wide
 kisi aparaadh kii gambhirtha is baat se bhi tay hoti he ki uskaa kisi peedit par kya asar padaa
 Unfortunately, it does not appear that this would have been taken care of during the ongoing trial on Aruna Shanbag
 ek routine adalati karrwai se ek routine kism kii sazaa nikali or ek shaks kii zindagi ko maut se bhi badtar bana dene vaala shaks kuch saal kii sajaa kaat kar bari ho gaya
 The biggest lesson in the life of Aruna Shanbag is that if a person can make someone's life meaningless, it can give some people the dignity to live with him
 aruna shanbagh kaa jivan unke liye bhale ahmiyat na rakhata rahaa ho, lekin vah bahut saare logon ke liye- king edward college kii un nurson ke liye, jinhone 42 saal tak unhen bachaae rakhaa - myne rakhata tha
 She may have survived 42 years in this situation even if she was cared for in this way
 yahaan ek sandesh hamaare liye bhi he- karunamrityu kaa kanoon bhale ban gaya ho, lekin jivan ko ham is kanoon se bada maane or yah samajhen ki dusron ke jivan main- sarokaar or smriti ke str par hi sahi- hamaara bhi bahut kuch shaamil he
 This truth of collectivity has a great significance in Indian contexts

 However, whatever he may be, for Aruna Shanbag his life is not what he could have been
 yah puraa prasang bataata he ki ek jurm sirf ek sharir ke saath ek haadasa nahin hota, uske zakhm man par bhi padate hai or bahut dur tak padate hai
 The severity of a crime is also determined by the impact it has on a victim
 durbhaagya se yah lagata nahin he ki aruna shanbagh par chal rahe mukademe ke vaqt is baat kaa khyal rakhaa gaya hoga
 a routine court action led to a routine sentence and a person who was sentenced to life imprisonment for a few years was sentenced to a few years' imprisonment
 aruna shanbagh ke jivan kaa sabase bada sabak yahi he ki ek vahshat agar kisi ke jivan ko vyarth bana sakati he to kuch logon kaa saath use phir bhi jeene kii garima de saktaa he
 Aruna Shanbag's life may not have mattered to her, but it mattered to many people - to the nurses at King Edward College who protected her for 42 years
 vah is haal main 42 saal bachi rah gayi to bhi shaayad isiilie ki unki is tarah dekhbhaal kii gai
 There is also a message for us here - even though the law of compassion has become a law, we should consider life larger than this law and understand that the lives of others - right on the level of concern and memory - also include our lot

 The time and place of the meeting of US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been decided
 singapore main milenge kim or trumpkim jong un or donald trump 2 june ko singapore main milenge
 Kim wants to complete her homework before meeting with US President Trump
 isi dauraan uttar korea main kaid america nagarikon ko chhodkar kim ne dosti kii pahal kii he
 In the year 2018, Kim is creating new history unlike her character
 is ek saal main kim ne itane kaam kiye hai jo usne apane shashan ke pichley tamaam saalon main nahin kiye
 Ice is melting on relations Relationships between North Korea and South Korea have melted during the Winter Olympics
 saath hi kim jong un ne parmaanu bam banane kii zid bhi chhod di he
 Meanwhile, Kim traveled to China by train
 aisa karke 70 saal main pehali baar uttar korea ne nayaa itihaas rach diya he
 And after all, now Kim and Trump are going to meet
 varsh 2017north korea ke shaasha kim jong un ne kaha tha- mere teble pe batan he, kabhi bhi dabaa duungaa
 So in response to this, US President - Donald Trump had said - i have a bigger button than you and it works too
 varsh 2018ab kim jong un kaa kahana he- agar america yuddh ko khatm karne kaa vaada kare to hamen apane parmaanu hathiyaar rakhkar mushkil main jeene kii kya jarurat he? udhar, america raashtrapati donald trump kah rahe hai- wo (kim jong un) kaaphi khule hue hai or ham jo dekh rahe hai, usase lagata he ki ve ek behad sammanit insaan hai
 Kim and Trumpkim are softened, and Trumpchand has become soft like Shabnam with blazing shoals in months
 2017 main ek duusare ko dhamka rahe the
 And now the verses are being read in praise of each other
 vajah kuch bhi ho magar duniyaavaalon ke liye ye raahat kii khabar he
 These feelings of love are being made so that when the American President and the North Korean Marshal meet, forget the old bitterness and talk in a pleasant atmosphere
 shart ke saath mulakatuttar korea ke jis taanashaah kii vajah se duniya par tisare vishwayuddh kaa khatra mandara rahaa tha wo ab parmaanu hathiyaaron ko chhodane ke liye taiyaar ho gaya he
 But he also has a condition and that condition is that the US President should promise him that he will end the Korean War
 haalanki iskaa faisla ab us mahamilan se hoga jo june ke pehle hafte main hone ko he
 Kim Jong Un who was imprisoned in Korea till now surprised the world with Kim's changed attitude
 achaanak ek manze hue rajaneta kii tarah naa sirf china or dakshin korea kaa daura kar rahaa he, balki korian peninsula main shanti ke liye apane sabase bade dushman donald trump se bhi milane ko raji he
 The feats Kim has performed in the last few months are completely opposite to her character
 haalanki ye badlaav achche hai magar phir bhi duniya hairaan he
 Prepare for the meeting because the first person travels for about 12 hours on his green train and goes to meet President Jingping
 phir 70 saal puraani dushmani ko bhulaakar wo dakshin korea kii dharti par kadam rakhata he or phir vah vimaan se dobaaraa china kii yatra par jaataa he
 And now he is preparing to meet US President Donald Trump
 wo bhi newclear site ko band karne kii shart par
 Trump has made it easy for you to tell you that in the last long time there was a debate about which corner of the world the two leaders would meet
 kyonki apni suraksha kii vajah se plane ke safar se parhez karne vaale kim jong un ke paas vikalpon kii kameen thi
 But Trump made it difficult for him and set a place for an appointment
 mulaakaat par lagi hai sabaki nigahempuri duniya is mulaakaat se pehle kii har halchal par nazar gadaaye hue he
 Because if Trump and Kim met in a happy atmosphere, then otherwise they would start to threaten world war again
 ham aapako daraa nahin rahe balki sambhaavnaaon se aagaah kar rahe hai, kyonki khud trump ye kah chuke hai ki agar baatcheet kaa koi hal nahin niklaa to wo meeting ko bich main hi chhod denge
 And then they will do what they have been doing till now

 Doctors are of the opinion that some special things should be kept in mind while buying sweets

 Sweets should be purchased from a shop that is clean and creditable
 mithai ko hameshaa chakhne ke baad hi khariden
 Fake Mawa sweets start spoiling and sour, so avoid buying them

 mashhoor geetkaar javed akhtar ne bollywood film industry ke sahyogi shekhar kapur par ravivaar ko twitor par jamkar hamalaa bolaa he
 Shekhar Kapur wrote on his official Twitter account that he feared intellectuals who are snake-like and still feel like a refugee decades after Partition in India
 is bayaan ke baad geetkaar javed akhtar ne twitor par jamkar khabar lee
 He reprimanded her tweet
 akhtar ne twitor par barasate hue lagaataar teen-chaar twit kar daale
 Apart from him, Twitter users also took a dig at film director Shekhar Kapur
 Started life as refugee of Partition
 Parents gave everything to make a life for kids
 Was always in fear of ‘intellectuals'
 They made me feel insignicant
 Small
 Then suddenly embraced me after my films
 i still fear them
 His embrace is like a bite of snake
 Still a refugee
 Shekhar Kapur wrote on his Twitter account, "he started his life as a refugee during the Partition of India
 mata-pita ne meraa jivan banane ke liye sab kuch arpan kar diya
 i was always afraid of 'intellectuals'
 unhone mujhe hameshaa adhuraa or chota mahasoos karavaaya or jab meri film chal padi to vahiin log meri saraahna karne lage
 i am still afraid of intellectuals
 buddhijiviyon se gale milanaa saanp ke dasane jaisaa he
 i am still a refugee today
 ''
 who are these intellectuals who embraced you and you found that embrace like a snake's bite? Shyam Benegal, Adoor Gopal Krishna, Ram chandra Guha? Really? 
 Shekhar saheb you are not well 
 You need help
 Come on , there is no shame in meeting a good psychiatrist 
 After this tweet, lyricist Javed Akhtar gave a befitting reply, writing, "who are these intellectuals who are embracing you and you feel like a snake bites from them?" Shyam Benegal, Adoor Gopal Krishna, Ram Chandra Guha? What really? Shekhar sir, you do not look well
 aapako madad kii jarurat he
 Do not be shy to meet a good psychiatrist
 ''what do you mean by still a refugee Does it mean that you feel like an outsider n not an Indian n you don't feel that this is your motherland 
 If in India you are still a refugee where will you not feel like a refugee, In Pakistan? Cut this melodrama you poor rich but lonely guy Javed Akhtar wrote in another tweet, "what does refugee mean?" Are you still living as an outsider in India? Don't you think it's your earth? If you are still a refugee in India, where will you not feel like a refugee, in Pakistan? Stop the melodrama of rich and poor, but you are the only person
 ''you introduce yourself as neither prejudiced by the past nor afraid of the future living in this moment and in the same breath you say you are a refugee of partition and still a refugee 
 One doesn't need a magnifying glass to see the contradiction
 javed akhtar ne is twit ke jariye bhi shekhar kapur par jamkar latad lagaai
 He wrote- "you have presented yourself in such a way that you neither have any meaning with the prejudices of the past nor are you scared in any way in the future
" or aap apane aapako bantwaare ke samay se sharnaarthi bataate aa rahe hai or aap ab bhi khud ko sharnaarthi hi maanate hai
 Anyone can see this paradox of yours in general
 ''no
 It means once you are a refugee, you feel a gypsy

 kendriya swasthya mantri dow
 Harshvardhan has given another controversial statement
 dow
 Harshvardhan has said that sex education should be banned in schools
 apni website drharshvardhan
 com the health minister wrote this
 swasthya mantri, jo ki khud ek doctor hai, ne apni website par likhaa he ki tathakthith sex ajukeshan par bain laganaa chahie
 Course content needs to be integrated with value education
 chaatro ko bharat ke saanskrithik sambandhon ke bare main zyada se zyada jaankaree deni chahie
 Being in the USA, Dr
 harshavardhan kii pratikriya nahin mil pai lekin unke daftar kaa kahana he ki ye swasthya mantri ke nijee vichaar hai
 Delhi BJP spokesperson Sanjay Kaul said that the party forum has not been discussed on the issue of banning sex education in schools, so we cannot react
 isse pehle unhone yah bayaan dekar bavaal khadaa kar diya tha ki aids kii beemaari se paar paane ke liye sarkaar ko condom ke istemaal ko badhaava dene ke bajaay bhartiya samskruti ke prachaar-prasar par jor dena chahie
 He said he would like to promote 'honest physical relations between husband and wife', which is part of Indian culture, to overcome HIV-AIDS
 'unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki condom ke istemaal kaa prachaar karne se galat sandesh jaataa he or iske istemaal se banaaya jane vaala har tarah kaa sambandh jaij lagane lagata he
 Therefore, the emphasis on AIDS campaign should not be just on the use of condoms

 The book is Archana Panuli, author of Highway E47
 is kitaab kaa prakaashan gyanganga prakaashan, dilli se hua he
 The time, space and the need to maintain the emotions, rituals, and human relationships in the kind of needs that have built a house around us are all lacking
 archana panyuli inhen pahaluon ke bich panapati vidambnaaon ko baariki se pakadaney vaali kahanikar hai
 They are among the selected storytellers who have the power to narrate the feelings of female discourse in an unhealthy manner
 unka taaja kahani sangrah unke paksh main di gai daleelon kii taaja gavaahi he
 Titled 'highway E47', his new collection has a bunch of 12 stories
 is guchchhe main maujuud harek kahani apni alag mahak, rang or ehsaas kii garmaahat samete hue he
 The title is a depiction of the human spirit in the story, which will be difficult to realize and feel until the situation has gone through
 sidhi-saadi jindagi se nikalakar duniyavi dushwariyon se ulajhate hue koi stri ek parivesh se duusare main khud ko kaise dhaal leti he, yahi is kahani kaa marm he
 'why she likes her' is a story whose situations are often seen around herself and this dialogue can be heard over and over again
 pyaar sareekhe behad nijee ehsaas par dakhal rakhane waalon ko yah kahani alag andaaj main sabak sikhalaa jaati he
 Perhaps the story of 'lakshmi' can be traced by all of us in the trappings of the vagabond
 hakeekat or jajbaat ke ghalmail se taiyaar is roopaantar main samvednaaon ko na sirf ek sahaara miltaa he, balki belgaum fasaanon ko badi shaleen thokar se rokane kaa jatan dikhaaya jaataa he
 There is a different anecdote of the infamous locality of Mumbai, which harbors innumerable stories and stories in its womb: 'godmother'
 is kahani kii dahalij par aakar inasaani rishte kaa ek nayaa sansar dikhne lagata he, jo jehan main kharonch to paidaa karata hi he, ummid kaa lep bhi detaa he
 The manner in which Panuli has chosen and woven his characters in this collection has made the stories extremely interesting and filled with the feeling of being around him
 in kahaniyon main vaicharik khulepan kii kami nahin akharati
 Impeccable comments only reveal the personality of the storyteller, the environment of the stories is a testimony to the fact that they have mastered the ability to close and scrape the atmosphere of any event

 com / l9aadcf1jm supreme court ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki rashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog (NJAC) ko bhagwaan bharose nahin choda ja saktaa
 The court said, “the government also believes that the situation of the collegium in the appointment of judges has made it objectionable
 'centre sarkaar kii ore seatorni general mukul rohtagine samvidhan peeth main bahes karte hue ki kaha ki jis tarah samvidhan ke adhyadesh 124 ko samajha gaya
 From him constitution maker Dr
 ambedkar kii aatma bhi pareshaan hogi, kyonki samvidhan main kahin bhi colegium system kii baat nahin he
 However, the court said that the government has objected only in 5 out of 100 cases
 haalanki is maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi samvidhan peeth main justise chelmeshwar ne kaha ki sarkaar is nae system ko isliye nahin laai kyonki dow
 Ambedkar's soul is disturbed, rather there is some other reason behind it
 rohtagi ne kaha kinyaaypalika kii aazaadeejajon kii niyukti ke baad hi shuru hoti he or nae system main jajon kii hi pramukhataa he
 If two out of three judges question the appointment of a person, then he cannot be appointed
 yachikakarta kaa ye kahana ki is system se nyaaypalika kii aazaadee main khalal hoga, ye baat kisi bhi tarah se thik nahin he
 He said that the collegium system of 1993 was formed due to the attitude of the government at that time, because the government at that time also tried to surround the judiciary
 ye sunwaayee aage bhi jari rahegi
 In this case, the constitution bench has also raised many questions on the central government in the past
 isse pehle court ne sarkaar se poocha tha ki wo bataae ki nayaa system kis tarah colegium system se behatar he or isse nyaaypalika kii aazaadee main khalal nahin padegaa
 If the government satisfies the court, the court will accept this system
 centre sarkaar ne pehle daleel di thi ki 1993 main supreme court kii nau jajon kii samvidhan peeth ne colegium system banaaya tha
 Therefore, this case should also be referred to a bench of 9 or 11 judges, but the court turned down the demand

 karnataka vidhansabha adhyaksh ke karyaalay ne buudhvaar ko supreme court main kaha ki kisi vidhayak kaa istife kaa haq ‘loktantric adhikaar' he or yah uchit samay he ki nyaaypalika spikaron ke lihaaj se dishanirdesh nirdhaarit kare
 Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Speaker, opposed the earlier Speaker's decision to disqualify the mlas
 unhone kaha ki vidhayak ko istipha dene kaa loktantric adhikaar he
 The loyalty of the legislators is to the electorate
 tatkaaleen spikar ne ayogyata se pehle vidhayakon ko saat din kaa notice nahin diya
 On behalf of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly office, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told a three-judge bench headed by Justice NV Raman that a legislator can be disqualified for quitting membership of a political party but disqualified if he leaves the house
 Can not be termed
 mehta ne yah daleel tab di jab peeth karnataka ke ayogy qaraar diye gayi 17 vidhayakon kii yachikaaon par sunwaayee kar rahi thi
 The mlas challenged the decision of former Assembly Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar to disqualify him
 peeth main nyaayamurti sanjeev khanna or nyaayamurti krishna murari bhi shaamil hai
 Mehta told the bench, "this may happen again and again and even after these 17 people, such cases can come up
" isi adaalat ne ek samvidhan peeth ke faisle main istife ke adhikaar ko mana he
 He said that resigning is a democratic right because people want to go back to the voter
 mehta ne kaha, ‘‘is maamle main ateet main jo hua, main uski aalochana nahin kar saktaa lekin yah baar-baar ho saktaa he or is mudde par nirnay hona chahie
 It is high time that the judiciary sets the guidelines for the speaker
 ''haalanki peeth ne kaha ki adaalatein vidhansabha adhyakshon ke liye dishanirdesh nahin tay kar saktin
 He said, "how can we set guidelines for the speaker? He is a constitutional post
 '' peeth ne kaha, ‘‘ham unke adhikaar kshetra main hastkshep nahin kar sakate
 Referring to a decision of the constitution bench of the apex court, the Solicitor General said that if a legislator does not agree with the views of his party and resigns from the membership of the House, he will seek a fresh mandate from the voters
 Can go between unhone kaha ki in 17 yachikakartaon ko karnataka ke tatkaaleen vidhansabha adhyaksh dwaara ayogyata prastaav par jawaab dene ke liye teen din kaa notice dena ‘tathyaatmak rup se galat' he
 Mehta said that changing a political party as an MLA is defection but deferring from the membership of the House first and then going to another party cannot be called defection

 Nihalchand Meghwal, who was the only face from Rajasthan in Narendra Modi's cabinet, realized the difficulties that came when he was invited to take oath out of the 25 mps of the state 
 hua bhi thik unke anumaan ke mutabik
 Within a few hours of taking oath of the minister, such a case came to light, which was found concocted by the police investigation at the time of the previous Congress government of the state and the case was closed by the lower court on the same basis
 darasal maamla aktubar 2011 kaa he
 a woman from Dabwali in Sirsa, Haryana, filed an FIR alleging rape on 17 people, including Nihalchand
 ek saal baad police ne closer report daakhil kar di
 Subsequently, the trial court and the district court also dismissed the woman's plea
 lekin nihalchand ke kendriya rasayan or urvarak rajyamantri banane ke baad peedit mahila ne maamle ko phir se chalaane ke liye punarvichaar yachika daakhil kar di
 At this, the court issued notice to the other party asking why not reopen the case
 is notice ke baad vipaksh ne fouran nihalchand ko mantriparishad se hataane kii maang shuru kar di
 Nihalchand is avoiding comment on the matter
 sutron ke mutabik, pichley hafte pradhanmantri narendra modi ne nihalchand ko bulaakar is vivaad par media main kisi tarah kii baatcheet na karne kii do-took hidaayat di thi
 But the bjp's concerns are raising questions on the image of the Modi government
 mushkil yah bhi he ki party kii andruni jaanch main nihaal ke khilaaf koi saboot nahin mili hai
 However, in the information received by the party, this is a conspiracy of some leaders of the BJP besides the Congress and other political rivals
 india today se baatcheet main rajasthan bijepi ke prabharee captain singh solanki kehete hai, “puraa cese jhootha he
 It would be an injustice to remove Nihal from the Council of Ministers on the basis of the facts held by the party
 hamen is cese ke bare main tab bhi maaloom tha jab loksabhaa kaa tikat diya or modi sarkaar main mantri banaaya
 After Nihal became a minister, his political opponents have got the woman to do this work under a conspiracy
 ” lekin virdohi koun he? ve kehete hai, “congress kaa to yahi kaam he, lekin shadyantrkaari kisi bhi party se jude ho sakate hai
 "from BJP too? “can be of any party
 main naam nahin luungaa lekin aap meri tippanee kaa arth samaj sakate hai
 "solanki then raises questions on the woman who accused him, saying that she also accused her husband of rape
 itnaa hi nahin, mahila ek sting main yah kehete hue dikh chuki he ki is maamle main nihalchand par lagaae uske aarope galat hai
 But the victim woman alleges that Nihalchand is being threatened and lured by the job to withdraw the case
 bijepi netaaon kaa yah bhi tark he ki koi bhi peedita doshi ko sajaa dene kii maang karti he lekin yah mahila lagaataar nihaal ko mantriparishad se hataane kii maang kar rahi he jisase uske rajnatik mantavya ko samaj ja saktaa he
 The BJP stands by its young minister based on facts and wants to wait for the court's stand
 lekin party kii mushkil sansad kaa bajet satr he jahaan vipaksh ke saath is mudde par takaraav kii naubat aa sakati he
 On the other hand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is very conscious of the image of his government, so a section of the BJP has been raising the possibility that if difficult matters, it is possible that Nihal will be kept away from the post of minister
 haalanki abhi to party kisi dabaav main aane kii bajaae chattan kii tarah nihalchand ke peeche khadi he
 But his major concern is the inner conspiracy

 And Islam is the greatest religion
 islam apane bare main aisi dharna pesh karata he
 However this is not true
 "om puri kaa vahabayaan yahaan dekha ja saktaahai
 It is clear from this interview that Om Puri did not say that "islam is the best religion in the world

 The government is preparing to reduce import duty on gold, which will have a direct effect that its price will come down
 sone ke daam main isi maheene kami ho sakati he
 In fact, the government had taken several steps to control the current budget deficit, one of which was to increase the duty on gold imports
 vitt mantri pi chidambaram kaa maananaa tha ki sone ke andhadhundh emport se arthvyavastha par bura asar padataa he or is par roak lagane kii jarurat he
 He further increased duty on gold imports
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki sone par kul 10 pratishat kii aayaat duty lag gai
 Two years ago it had only 2 percent duty
 natijatan bharat main sona behad mahangaa ho gaya or isaki smagaling shuru ho gai
 India is the world's largest buyer of gold, but gold production here is negligible, so gold is the most imported here
 pichley saal bharat ne lagbhag 700 ton sone kaa emport kiya tha
 The country had to spend 88 billion dollars on this
 is saal akele may maheene main usne 182 ton sone kaa record emport kiya tha
 This put a lot of pressure on the dollar
 vah or upar chadh gaya
 The current budget deficit (CAD) increased due to increase in imports and exports where they were staying
 sarkaar ne ise rokane ke liye hi kade kadam uthaae jisamen duty main badhotaree or uski supplai par ankush lagaae gaye
 But it had a bad effect and not only the smuggling of gold started, but the export of jewelery was also hit
 bharat aabhushanon kaa bahut bada niryaatak desh he
 It has a very bad effect on the companies engaged in the gold business and they are very angry with the government at this time
 uski lobby is samay sakriy he
 Big jewelers export billions of dollars worth of gold jewelery
 unke saamne samasya khadi ho gai he
 Now the current budget deficit has also reduced
 ab yah santoshjanak str par aa gaya he
 On the other hand, the dollar has also become 10 percent cheaper against the rupee
 sone kaa emport bhi kaaphi ghat gaya he
 Only 47 in July
 5 ton sone kaa emport hua, jabaki agast main to lagbhag 10 ton se zyada sone kaa emport nahin hua
 The biggest thing is that there is no stock of gold in the market
 aisi sthiti main sarkaar sone par lage niyantran ko kam karnaa chaahati he, haalanki kuch halkon main abhi sakhti jari rakhane kii bhi baat kii ja rahi he, lekin aisa lagata he ki sarkaar 2 pratishat emport duty kam kar sakati he or iskaa faisla lok sabha satr khatm hone ke baad ho saktaa he

 Genre-blog archive-lk advaniprakashak-prabhat Prakashan price-rs 300 (paper back) To date, senior BJP leader LK Advani is seen as a pillar of politics
 party line se hatakar unki tarif kii jaati he, kuch saarvajanik taur par karte hai to kuch dabi jubaan main
 The reason for this is not just Advani's 40 years of political experience, the roles he played during this time are more important
 desh ke purv vinievesh mantri arun shouri ke shabdon main, 'ucch pad or itani prasiddhi praapt karne ke baavjood adwaniji hameshaa mridubhashi or udaar bane rahe
 He is very democratic

 Despite being 87, his brain is young and curious
 ' agar itnaa guni shaks apane anubhav ko baantne ke liye sanchaar ke yuva madhyamon se ek, 'blog' kaa istemaal karata he to yah bhi uski khubi hi he
 He is walking step by step with the changing times
 'raashtra sarvopari' sheershak kii yah kitaab laalkrishna adwani dwaara likhe gaye blogon kaa sangrah he
 It is a compilation of 54 blogs written over 17 months (22 June 2012 to 22 November 2013)
 yah blog sangrah kaa doosraa ank he
 There were a total of 108 blogs in the previous compilation
 adwani ke blog bahuyami vishyon par hai
 Be it politics or sports
 siyaasi sankat ho yaa aarthik pech
 Be it Osama bin Laden or the subject of Guantanamo Bay detention
 unhone har mudde par apane vichaar vyakt kiye hai
 Today's events are well connected with history, it is a good attempt to find relevance
 haal ke dinon desh ke pehle grahamantri sardaar vallabh bhai patel kii viraasat ko lekar chal rahe siyaasi sangram kaa asar adwani ke blog par bhi dikhataa he
 On many occasions he tries to show Jawaharlal Nehru as an opponent of Patel
 apni baton ko pramanikta dene ke liye tatkaaleen afasarshahon or itihaaskaaron dwaara likhi gai kitabon ke jaruri ansh kaa zikr karte hai
 By the way, Advani's writing on Patel is also important because the BJP has given him the name of Iron Man which is basically used for the country's first Home Minister, and nowadays Narendra Modi is also trying to create a similar image
 rochak kahani-'adbhut lekhak-vichaarprerak pustak' sheershak vaale blog main adwani ne likhaa he, 'raashtrapati gel singh kaa usee aspataal main oparation hua, jisamen unke purvavarti sanjeeva reddy kaa hua tha
 When he was taken to the operation theater, the chief surgeon asked the president, Are you ready? (are you ready)? no aai em note, unhone jawaab diya
 Eye m Zail Singh
 (nahin, main nahin hum
 i am Zail Singh
 ) adwani ji ne ye vakya kitaab 'humar ij lathil vaipan' se liya he
 Advani has written about the birth of his party in a blog titled 'BJP and Easter Sunday'
 is ghatnakram kaa ullekh unhone apni aatmakatha main bhi kiya he
 Advani writes, 'the decision to expel all members of the Jan Sangh from the Janata Party brought great relief
 5 or 6 april, 1980 ke do divasiy sammelan ne sphurtidayak bhaavana or drudh vishwaas joda
 More than 3500 delegates gathered at the Ferozeshah Kotla ground in Delhi and on 6 April a new political party Bharatiya Janata Party was announced

 Along with Sikandar Bakht and Surajbhan, i was given the responsibility of General Secretary
 'kya khaas he kitaab main?itihaas kaa gyaan behad jaruri he, aapaki soch ke liye
 The events of the past suggest a way to create a better future by coping with the difficulties of the present
 adwani ke blog kuch yahi kaam karte hai
 While these memorable stories for his contemporaries are knowledge for the youth of today, which serve to further mature their thinking and understanding
 in blogon ke jariye adwani apni kahaniyaan to sunaate hi hai, saath main maardarshak ke taur par samasya kaa zikr kar uskaa samaadhaan bhi sujhaate hai
 The background of most blogs is related to social events, so it is natural to be diverse
 talopis (pashchilekh), blog kaa mjedaar kissa vaala bhaag he
 The interesting information and stories written in it make the reading experience more fun
 jaise ki 'bhaajapa or easter sande' blog ko padhakar bijepi ke gathan ke satahi vajahon or pariprekshya ko samajha ja saktaa he
 Blogs are very direct
 chaahe party line kuch bhi ho, adwani ne har baar spashtataa ke saath apana paksh rakhaa he jisapar vivaad bhi hue
 There is a concrete presentation in terms of facts, it has not been attempted to be broken or misrepresented which matches the character of Advani
 kyon khariden ye kitatiogar aap internet par akasar nahin jate to is blog sangrah ke jariye adwani ke vichaar ko jaan sakate hai

 sir par savaar tha khunalekin gudgaanv kii is vaardaat main log mahaj tamashbin nahin rahe, balki unhone kaatil kaa shikaar ban rahe ladki ko bachaane kii purajor koshish kii
 It is another matter that here also the murderer had blood on his head and he managed to kill the girl
 sisitivi main kaid hui vaardatsubah kaa vakt he or ghadi main nau bajkar 45 minute hue the
 Then one person is seen moving fast among the hundreds of people at MG Road metro station in Gurgaon
 is shaks ko dekh kar ye andaja lagaana bhi mushkil he ki agle hi pal wo kya karanevaala he
 But two to three seconds pass and after grabbing a girl running ahead of her, she is attacked with sharp knives
 do chaaku lagate hi ladki ladkadaa kar jameen par gir jaati he
 But the attacker does not leave him and continues to attack him
 hamalavar par tut padi bheedpahale to aas-paas guzar rahe logon ko bhi maamla samaj main nahin aata, lekin 10 se 12 second guzarate-guzarate ek shaks aage aata he or apane bag se markar hamalavar ko vahaan se bhagane kii koshish karata he, lekin ladkaa peeche nahin hatataa balki ladki ke upar baith kar lagaataar use chaaku martha rahata he
 Meanwhile, one by one, three or four people start throwing bags and other things at him in an attempt to stop him, but to no avail
 karata rahaa ladki par varalogon ne shor machaakar hamalavar kaa dhyaan bhatakaane kii koshish kii, us par bag se hamalaa kiya lekin uske sir par khun is kadar savaar tha ki wo tus se mas nahin hua
 Meanwhile, the attacker not only stabs the girl, but also stabs her throat with a knife

 ladki ke roj uski tampo main metro stesan tak jane kii vajah se jitendra ye maan baitha tha ki pinki usase pyaar karne lagi he jabaki pinki pehle se shaadishuda thi or uske dil main aisa kuch bhi nahin tha
 In spite of his refusal, Jitendra once went to Shillong to ask his family for his hand, but he had to return from there
 pinki ne siraphire ke auto se janaa kiya bandpulice kii maane to abhi haal ke dinon main jitendra se peechha chhudaane ke liye pinki ne usase duuri bananaa shuru kar diya tha
 Now she did not even go to the metro station in her tampo
 bas pinki kaa yahi ravaiya use itnaa nagavar gujara ki usne pinki kii jaan lene kii puri sajeesh hi rach lee
 Not to be murdered, with the help of some people, the police arrested Jitendra on the occasion for the murder of the girl
 lekin iske baad jab usase poochtacha hui, to usne bataaya ki usne apane kiye kaa koi bhi malaal nahin
 According to the police, Jeetendra had killed about 20 knives on that day and had also cut the vein of his throat, which caused Pinky to bleed and lose her life
