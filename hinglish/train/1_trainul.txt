 Let us know that a high-powered investigation committee of Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday revoked the Scheduled Tribe certificate of BJP MP Jyoti Dhurve
 anusuchit janajati (ST) varg ke liye arakshit baitool seat se saal 2009 se saansad raheen dhurve ne apane chunavi halafname main apni jati gond bataai thi

 ' Begusarai, popularly known as Bihar's 'leningrad' and 'mini Moscow', is not only one of the 'hot' seats of the country in the Lok Sabha elections 2019, but has also managed to turn the center of politics towards itself
 begusarai seat par usee tarah puure desh kii nazren tiki hai, jaise varanasi, amethi, raibareli or vynad kii seat par
 BJP firebrand leader Giriraj, who along with former JNU students' union Kanhaiya Kumar, has been trying to send his opponents to Pakistan on the talk of Begusarai seat, which has become the center of the politics of Bihar in this Lok Sabha election, There are lions
 haalanki, mahagathban kii ore se rajd pratyaashee tanwir hasan kii ummidavaari ne bhi mukaable ko kaaphi dilachasp bana diya he
 Kanhaiya Kumar was first to field from Mahagathbandhan, but due to not getting the green signal from Tejashwi Yadav, Mahagathbandhan did not make Kanhaiya his candidate
 tabhi se bihar kii siyaasi phijaaon main aisi hawaaen chal rahi hai ki kyon tejasvi ne kanhaiya ko rajd ke tikat se nahin utaara, kya tejasvi kanhaiya kii lokapriyata se darate hai yaa phir yuva pratinidhitiv kaa kuch masalaa he?darasal, kanhaiya ko mahagathbandhan kii ore se ummidavaar na banaae jane ke baad media main kai tarah kii khabaren tairti dikhin
 Everyone was able to explain the decision according to their own
 kanhaiya or tejasvi ko lekar kai tarah kii baaten kii gayi, masalan donon yuva hai or tejasvi nahin chaahate ki unke rahete bihar main koi unase bada yuva netaa khadaa ho jaae aadi-aadi
 If Begusarai is making media headlines today, then there is no doubt that the reason for this is Kanhaiya Kumar's candidature
 kanhaiya kumaar kii ummidavaari ne begusarai seat ko surkhiyon main laa diya he, isse andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kanhaiya kii lokapriyata kaa graph kitna ooncha he or shaayad tejasvi yadav is baat ko bakhubi jaanate hai
 Political analysts believe that Tejashwi Yadav's political fear was also due to Kanhaiya Kumar not getting ticket from the Grand Alliance
 tejasvi yadav kabhi nahin chahenge ki unke saamne bihar main koi unase bada yaa unhen takkar dene vaala koi yuva netaa saamne aa jaae
 Tejashwi may have been fearing that if he gives a ticket to Kanhaiya, then Kanhaiya may be seen to give a boost to his popularity tomorrow or to create a youth image parallel to him
 is dar kii kai vajahen bhi hai
 Kanhaiya is very popular among the youth, he has shown this from several forums
 tejasvi yadav ko bhi iskaa ehsaas he ki kanhaiya kii jeet, kanhaiya ko or bhi zyada popular bana degi or unamem or bhi dhar aa jayega
 Also, Tejashwi Yadav used to be compared to Kanhaiya Kumar
 isliye raajnneeti ke drushtikon se dekhen to yah ek tarah se tejasvi ke liye khatre kii ghanti hi sabit ho sakate hai
 There is also a fundamental difference in the popularity of Kanhaiya Kumar and Tejashwi Yadav, which is well known to the public
 tejasvi yadav kii lokapriyata ke peeche unke pita lalu prasad yadav kaa haath he
 On the other hand, Tejashwi Yadav has inherited politics and popularity
 magar kanhaiya kumaar ke saath aisa nahin he
 Kanhaiya has gained popularity on its own
 itnaa hi nahin, kanhaiya ke saath tejasvi kii tarah koi raajnneetik viraasat bhi nahin he
 Tejashwi Yadav got political land made, but Kanhaiya built his own land
 begusarai se aakar jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay main chaatrasangh ke president se lekar sipiai ke netaa tak, kanhaiya kumaar ne apane bal par sab kuch hasil kiya he
 Kanhaiya has carved out his own land other than Tejashwi Yadav or other leaders
 yahi vajah he ki kanhaiya in maamalon main bhi tejasvi ko takkar de sakate hai
 If Kanhaiya got a RJD ticket from Begusarai, Tejashwi Yadav would have to face the same problems again
 yuvaaon main kanhaiya ke prati sahanubhuti dikh rahi he
 Some journalists who cover Politics Beat believe that youth voters are seen going with Kanhaiya Kumar in Begusarai
 kyonki giriraaj singh kaa ab bhi bhoomihaar votaron par dabadabaa he or rajd kaa apana vot bank he, jisaki vajah se muqabla trikoniya he
 Kanhaiya is quite popular not only among the youth of Begusarai, but also among the youth of different parts of the country
 tejasvi yadav shaayad is baat se bhi avgat rahe honge ki kanhaiya kumaar ko rajd se tikat dene kaa matlab he ki apane saamne khud ek or yuva netaa khadaa karnaa jo baad main unke liye shaayad mushkil khadi kar sakate hai
 Talking about writing Kanhaiya Kumar, he is far ahead of Tejashwi Yadav
 kanhaiya piechdi kii degree le chuke hai, jabaki tejasvi yadav ke qualification ke bare main metric or nan metric par ab bhi vivaad he
 If seen in this case, Tejashwi Yadav may also have problems with this in future and Kanhaiya may also have a better weapon against Tejashwi in preparing the counter natives
 rajd ke bheetar hi kanhaiya or tejasvi yadav ke bich main tulana hone lagati or phir kai maanakon par parkhaa jaataa to kanhaiya is main baaji bhi maar sakate hai
 Also, the stunning Yadav in the art of speech proves weak in front of Kanhaiya
 kanhaiya bijepi ke pravaktaaon ke saath bahes main apni is kala kaa parichay de chuke hai
 Not only this, he is often seen in speeches opposing the Modi government and power
 magar tejasvi ke bhaashan main kanhaiya jaisi dhar nahin dikhti
 Tejaswi Yadav's biggest problem with Kanhaiya's candidature from RJD was that Kanhaiya Kumar is still an accused in the anti-national slogan case in JNU
 agar tejasvi yadav unhen tikat dete to bijepi ko yah bolne kaa mauka mil jaataa ki rajd kathith 'deshadrohi' ko tikat de rahi he
 However, it is different that now BJP has fielded Malegaon blast accused Pragya Singh Thakur from Bhopal against Digvijay Singh
 magar tejasvi yadav kahin se bijepi ko rajd par hamalaa bolne kaa ek bhi mauka nahin dena chaahate the
 Also, the way Tanveer Hassan performed in the 2014 elections despite the Modi wave, Tejashwi could not deny that he knew that Bhumihar caste would be a candidate from BJP and Kanhaiya also comes from the same caste, so he can win the match by relying on his old candidate in between
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main rajd ke pratyaashee hasan ne yahaan bhaajapa ko jabardast takkar di thi, lekin bhaajapa ke bholaa singh se vah 58,000 se zyada maton se haar gaye the
 cpi's Rajendra Prasad Singh finished third in that election
 bholaa singh ko 4,28,227 mat to tanwir hasan ko 3,69,892 mat mili the
 However, Begusarai's politics has been based on caste
 balwada, tejada, begusarai, matihani, baliya, bakhri, cheriabariyarpur saat vidhansabha kshetra vaale begusarai loksabhaa kshetra main ek anumaan ke mutabik, 19 lakh matadaataaon main se bhoomihaar matadaata kareeb 19 fisadi, 15 fisadi muslim, 12 fisadi yadav or saat fisadi kurmi hai
 The politics here mainly revolves around the Bhumihar caste
 is baat kaa saboot he ki pichley 10 loksabhaa chunaavon main se kam se kam nau baar bhoomihaar saansad bane hai
 However, right now all the people in Begusarai are working hard
 haalanki, is rochak jang main kiski jeet hogi, yah to 23 may ke chunaav parinaam aane ke baad hi pataa chalegaa

 The same if any two people are in love and establish a physical relationship with mutual consent but do not get permission from the society for this, then it will be called 'adultery' ie 'adultery'
 or in dinon supreme court main isi edltri ko lekar bahes chhidi hui he
 There is a debate that if a man forms a relationship with a married woman without the permission of the woman's husband, then it is a punishable offense
 lekin dand sirf us purush ke liye hi he jisane sambandh banaae hai, mahila ko aparadhmukt rakhaa gaya he
 In such a situation, social activist Joseph Shine, who has filed a petition in the court, says that either men as well as women should be punished in the case of IPC Section 497 i
e
 'adultery', because if the mistake has been made It has been done with mutual consent
 aise main sirf purush hi kyon doshi ho? mahila kyon nahin? nahin to phir is kanoon ko hi khatm kar diya jaae
 The Supreme Court is yet to come to a decision on this matter, but the Central Government has clarified its stand and said that it is necessary to remain 497 so that the institution named Vivah remains
 agar dhara 497 ko hataa diya gaya to samjik sanrachana bigadane kii sambhaavna bad jaaegi
 We need to understand Section 497 of the IPC before this social structure is created and deteriorated
 aakhir he kya bhalaa ye 497?takreeban 150 saal pehle jab maikale kanoon likhane baithe to apane simit bhartiya gyaan ko dhyaan main rakhte hue unhone ek kanoon likhaa
 Under this law, if a man has made a relationship with another man's woman and if the husband feels many about it, then he can complain about it
 jiske khilaaf shikaayat darj kii gai he us par jurmaana lagata tha
 The accused person was freed by paying a fine
 maikale ne tab dhara 497 ko aparaadh kii shrenee se baahar rakhaa
 But when the laws were amended and new laws were enacted, then section 497 was put in the category of 'crime'
 jiske tahat do se paanch saal tak kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya
 Since then, this law has remained intact in this form
 dekhne vaali baat he edltri ko maikale ke desh yani britain main aparaadh nahin mana jaataa jabaki bharat main yah ek kukrity or saamaajik aparaadh he
 Now we need to understand how long we will carry the centuries old laws
 upar se abhi jo yachika daayar kii gai he jiske tahat agar 497 ko khatm karne kii bajaay mahilaon ko bhi dand kaa bhaagi bana diya gaya
 In this case, only women will file cases against other women
 saath hi is dhara main is baat kaa bhi zikr he ki yadi pati kii anumati le kar koi purush uski patni se sambandh sthapit karata he to vah aparaadh yaa vyabhichaar kii shrenee main nahin rakhaa jayega
 That is, by taking permission from the husband, no one can form a relationship with his wife and it does not matter whether the wife is approved or not
 phir to aise cese ke badhane kii sambhaavna bad jaati he, jahaan pati apane phaayde ke liye patni ko kisi ke saath sone ke liye vivash kar de
 What a sad thing that a woman does not even have the right to have a relationship with someone of her own pleasure
 vaise bhi apane desh main sex ko lekar maun rahane kii parampara rahi he
 Especially those women who express their voice on these subjects immediately this society raises their finger on their character
 sirf itnaa hi nahin, 497 main is baat kaa bhi zikr he ki agar purush kisi avivaahit ladki se sambandh banaata he to vah vyabhichaar kii shrenee main nahin aata
 There has also been no clarification as to whether the man would have to get permission from his wife to have a relationship if he already had a wife
 yani kii patniyaan patiyon kii sampatti hai
 Can they not have their own desires or desires? Why not give this right to two adults who want to establish a physical relationship by mutual consent? Why is it important to have a relationship with the person you are married to? It can happen and there are many times that despite marriage, that understanding or love is not able to develop in two people, after which one of those two people will have someone What is wrong with an outsider or a woman? Why should social rules be kept above the will of man every time? When a human being, whether a man or a woman, performs his social duties, if he makes a physical relationship with someone with his pleasure, then why should the society object to it? Isn't human right to think for happiness? Now whatever decision comes from the Supreme Court, but keeping in mind a progressive thinking, we should not let anyone down for this

 In this case, the statement of ten people including JDU MP Jagdish Sharma and three IAS officers were recorded in a special CBI court
 pravaas kumaar singh kii adaalat main chaara ghotaalaa maamla aar si 20e main jadyu saansad sharma or teen varisht iees adhikariyon phool chandra singh, bek julius or mahesh prasad samet kul das logon ke bayaan darj kiye gaye
 The case was registered by the CBI in 1996
 yah chibasa koshagaar se chaara or pashupaalan vibhaag ke liye dawaaiyon ke naam par 37 karod 70 lakh rupye kii avaidh nikasi se judaa hua he
 Significantly, in this scam of Rs 950 crore, the special court has given its verdict in 41 cases so far, in which hundreds of people have been sentenced
 sutron ne bataaya ki lalu apana bayaan darj karne ke liye aaj ranchi pahunch gayi
 In the Noida and Greater Noida land acquisition case, the Allahabad High Court has canceled the acquisition of land in Shahberry, Devla and Asadullahpur villages
 adaalat ne baaki gaanvon main kisaanon ko badi hui dar se (64% adhik) muaavja or 10% viksit jameen dene kaa bhi aadesh diya he
 The court has said that the farmers who have taken compensation in these three villages can withdraw their land by paying compensation
 adaalat ne 40 gaanvon main bilderon ko philhal nirmaan roak kar ensiaar planning board se manjuuri lene ko kaha he, jiske baad ve phir se nirmaan kaary shuru kar sakate hai
 The order of three judges of the Allahabad High Court, while giving the verdict on 491 petitions challenging the acquisition of land in Noida and Greater Noida, has brought great relief to the investors
 gauratlab he ki noida ke 23 or greater noida ke 40 gaanv ke kisaanon kii ore se daakhil in yachikaaon main kisaanon ne kareeb 5,000 hectare jameen ke adhigrahan ko chunauti di thi
 Farmers say that the authority imposed the land clause and took away their land in one and a quarter of the price and later sold it to big builders
 hoicourt ke teen jaj justise esayu khan, justise ashok bhushan or justise wike shukla ne 30 sitambar ko maamle par apana faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 The Court took seriously that the land was acquired on a large scale for the purpose of planned industrial development by imposing an emergency clause in the district, but was later handed over to private builders for the construction of residential complexes
 peeth ne kaha, rajya ke mukhya sachiv ko ek aise adhikari jo sachiv ke rank se neeche na ho, ke jariye nijee bilderon ko bhoomi aabantan kii sampurna prakriya kii jaanch karaane or isaki rapat rajya sarkaar ko saunpane kaa nirdesh diya jaataa he
 a lawyer appearing on behalf of the farmers said, "there is a kind of mafia working in connivance with authority officials because the way the land was acquired was unfair
" unhone kaha, meri niveshkon se puri sahanubhuti he, lekin ucchtam nyaayalay ne kaha he ki yah vivaad puri tarah se kisaanon or bilderon ke bich he
 Surendra Yadav, a farmer of Itara village who received compensation, said, "we are not satisfied with this order
" isamen nayaa kuch nahin
 We could do this deal two-three months in advance
 agar ve ise khatm nahin karte to ham ucchtam nyaayalay jaaenge
 The state government's imposition of an emergency clause of the Land Acquisition Act has been a major cause of resentment among the petitioners and the affected farmers claim that they have been denied the opportunity to raise objections and negotiate for better compensation
 iske alaava, ve bhoomi ke istemaal main badlaav par bhi aapatti karte rahe he or unka kahana tha ki jahaan sarkari adhisuchana main niojit audyogic vikaas kaa hawala dekar bhoomi adhigrahan kiya gaya, ise baad main bilderon ko makaan banane ke liye saunp diya gaya
 Many builders and flat owners had also filed petitions in the High Court and requested the court that they would be severely affected by the adverse order
 gauratlab he ki noida, greater noida or noida ekstansion ke ilaakon kaa vikaas mayawati sarkaar kii praathamikta suchi main kaaphi upar rahaa he
 However, over the years land acquisition for this purpose has become a sensitive issue and the government is finding itself in a state of confusion due to heavy opposition from farmers and criticism from opposition parties
 isse pehle, 12 may ko ucch nyaayalay ne gautam buddha nagar ke shahberi gaanv main 156 hectare bhoomi ke adhigrahan ko radd kar diya tha
 The land was acquired by the state government in the name of industrial development, but was later sold to private builders
 ucch nyaayalay ke is nirnay ke khilaaf rajya sarkaar ne ucchtam nyaayalay main apil kii thi jise ucchtam nyaayalay ne thukraa diya tha
 Considering the seriousness of the case, the court set up a special bench of three judges to hear all these petitions

 After winning 14 seats in 1962, the party won 35 seats in the 1967 general elections
 desh bhar main apana prabhaav badhaane or congress ke mukaable main ek “rashtriya loktantric vikalp” viksit karne ke prayaas main tab jansangh ne farrukhabad se raamamanohar lohia, amroha se acharya kriplani or rajkot se swatantra party ke minu masani kaa samarthan kiya tha
 This journey did not last long and with the sudden death of Upadhyay in 1968, his rise and rise in the party came to an abrupt halt
 mughalsarai stesan ke paas unka shav rail kii patariyon par padaa mila tha
 Some of the BJP people still believe that he was murdered
 pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay us samay tak hindutv main nihit ekta ke darshan “ekatm maanavvaad” par chaar vyaakhyaan de chuke the
 Indeed, these lectures of his were Marxist and its great Indian thinker M
 en
 Was the answer to Roy's "deep inhuman mechanicalism"
 roy ke darshan ko “radical humanism” ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The Jana Sangh and its legacy BJP were definitely molded by Upadhyay
 lekin party ke pitamah laalkrishna adwani, jo upaadhyaay ko apana rajnatik guru maanate hai or jinhone atal bihari vaajapeyi ke saath milakar bijepi ko ek taqatvar party ke rup main viksit kiya, ko upaadhyaay kenehru memorial main yojit janmashti mahotsav main nahin bulaayaa gaya tha
 This campaign to make Upadhyaya a great man raises two questions - why BJP and RSS are not giving such respect to their other ideal heroes, such as K
 bi
 Hedgewar, Guru Golwalkar and Veer Savarkar
 or kya upaadhyaay bijepi ke nehru hai?sahasrabuddhe kehete hai, “nehru ke prati kisi tarah kaa anadar na jataate hue yah kahana galat nahin hoga ki dinadayal ji ne jansangh ko khadaa karne ke liye jo sangharsh kiya, vah congress ko banane main nehru ke sangharshon se kahin bada he
 According to Sahasrabuddhe, as a disciple of Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru "found the Congress party served in a silver plate
" ” jabaki upaadhyaay ne ek-ek eent rakh jansangh ko khadaa kiya tha
 Sahasrabuddhe may deny any specific motive, but the fact is that the party had very carefully selected the Nehru Memorial Library to celebrate Upadhyay's birth centenary, while the event is comfortably near the RSS headquarters in the old city Could be held at the Deendayal Research Institute
 16 sitambar ko nehru memorial ke nideshak mahesh rangarajan ko istipha dene par majaboor kar bijepi shaayad yah bataanaa chaahati thi ki dakshinpanthi vichaarkon ko lambey samay se rashtriya vimarsh se dur rakhaa gaya he or ab unhen raashtra ke nirmaan main uchit sthaan milanaa hi chahie
 And what better place than the one associated with Nehru at the national level for this? At that event, Arun Jaitley mentioned that despite Nehru's high stature, Upadhyaya prepared a "parallel idea" and "specific organization"
 Were successful in doing
 lekin itihaaskaaron kaa kahana he ki upaadhyaay kaa mukhya darshan “ekatm maanavvaad ke vyakchayan” saamaanya vichaaron se adhik kuch nahin he, unhen kisi bhi tarah se moulik vichaar nahin mana ja saktaa
 a similar idea has been expressed in German Romantics about the addition of mind, body and soul
 roosi slavophiles ne 19veen sadi main iskaa jamkar anusaran kiya tha
 But Upadhyay's views were considered important because he was addressing his original audience
 rajnatik vishleshak pratap bhanu mehta kehete hai ki bijepi ke paas zyada mahapurush nahin rahe hai, isiilie upaadhyaay kaa naam aage badhaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Along with this they also say, "but Shyama Prasad Mukherjee or K
 em
 Instead of advancing more progressive individuals like Munshi, the BJP appears to be socially confined within its conservative circles
 ”magar bijepi kii suchi main upaadhyaay kaa naam aakhir saavarkar, golwalkar yaa headgavar jaise aadarshon se aage kyon he? is bare main sahasrabuddhe kehete hai, “prerana ke ek strot se duusare strot ke bich bhed karne kaa koi sawaal nahin he
 We also respect our opponents
 guru golwalkar ek aadhyatmik vichaarak the, jabaki dinadayalji ne hamaare saamne rajnatik vichaar rakhe the
 "but on the condition of keeping his name a secret, a BJP source admitted that" Golwalkar's views may cause controversy
 ”nishchit rup se congress ne jis tarah se kai dashakon tak nehru-gandhi kaa mahimamandan kiya, uski pratikriya honi hi thi, haalanki khud nehru ko kabhi is tarah kaa mahimamandan pasand nahin tha
 But the BJP seems to be trying to outdo the most talked about hero of modern India through the glorification of its hero

 input- IANS input-ians sidi cond main giraftaar kiye gaye patrkaar vinod verma kii jamaanat yachika par somvaar ko sunwaayee hogi
 Two days ago Vinod Verma's lawyers filed a bail plea in the court, but the case diary was not presented by the police, as a result the hearing was adjourned
 court ne somvaar ko police diary pesh karne kii hidaayat di
 Journalist Vinod Verma was arrested by the Chhattisgarh Police on October 27 from Ghaziabad
 vahaan kii court ne unhen teen din ke police remand par chhattisgarh police ko saupa tha
 Subsequently, the District Court of Raipur extended the police remand for another three days
 31 oktober ko unhen 13 dinon ke liye jeudicial remand par jail daakhil kara diya gaya
 In the bail application submitted by Verma, it has been said that no CD has been recovered from him nor any objectionable item has been found
 chhattisgarh police ne unhen jhuthe aaropon main fansaaya he
 It has also been said in this application that a pay nadrive and a laptop have been found from him
 udhar sidi cond main maamle ko sangeen banane ke liye police edi chotii kaa jor laga rahi he
 Police have continued raids to prevent the case filed against journalist Vinod Verma in the court
 bhilai or durg ke kai vyapaariyon or congress se jude kaaryakartaaon se police kii poochtacha jari he
 Explain that the state government has handed over the investigation to the CBI
 duusari ore police tabadatod kaarywahi kar kai logo ko hiraasat main lekar unhen aropit bhi kar rahi he
 These are people who are closely related to Congress President Bhupesh Baghel and journalist Vinod Verma
 vinod verma ke mobile par lagaataar sampark main rahane vaale darjan bhar logon se police poochtacha kar rahi he
 Some businessmen, including the Mayor of Durg, Devendra Yadav, have also been questioned in this case
 abhi takchhattisgarh policeyah nahin bataa saki he ki darty sidi cond main blakemeling or sajeesh main vinod verma kis tarah se shaamil hai
 This fact has not yet been established by the police
 yahi nahin yah sidi kisne or kab banaai yah bhi saaf nahin ho paaya he
 The police continues to have a frenzy regarding what the purpose of making the CD was
 congress samet kai logon ko police kii kaarywahi puri tarah se sandehaaspad najar aa rahi he
 In a hurry, the police go to Delhi by government plane, and then arrest the journalist Vinod Verma overnight
 sidi viral hone ke chand ghanton ke bheetar mantri rajesh munat kaa sidi ke farji hone kaa daawa karnaa bhi kisi sajeesh se kam najar nahin aa rahaa he
 Raipur Superintendent of Police Sanjeev Shukla and IG Pradeep Gupta have said that neither the journalist Vinod Verma's name nor the Dirty CD is of Minister Rajesh Munat in the FIR lodged at Pandari police station in Raipur
 or naa hi donon hi afasaron or police staff ne ashleel sidi dekhi he
 In such a situation, how did the police team reach Delhi by special plane
 kai mahatvapurn sawaalon kaa jawaab donon hi afasar nahin de paae
 Usually, the police of the state does not even take care of the accused even after several days of the registration of the FIR
 aise main raipur police bhi jaanch ke ghere main he
 After all, there is confusion about what the CBI will do
 darasal aparaadh kii puri vivechna ek esaiti kar rahi he
 In such a situation, the government recommended a CBI inquiry as it is under question aamtaur par prakaran sibiai ko sifarish kiye jane ke baad paardarshita baratate hue sambandhit rajya kii police apni tafteesh ko kisi tathy vishesh main laa kar viraam de detii he, lekin chhattisgarh main aisa nahin ho rahaa he
 Why the Congress state president Bhupesh Baghel has not been asked even while he is in the city and a case has been registered against him under the IT Act by accusing him of distributing CD of this dirty CD scandal
 kai aise tathy he jisase lagata he ki police kii kaarywahi li se hatakar ho rahi he
 In such a situation, it will be important to see what the CBI will investigate
 chhattisgarh police vishesh ruchi lekar sidi cond ke tamaam tathyon ko ikaitha kar rahi he
 Prakash Bajaj, the original complainant, is walking around avoiding media attention
 police se lekar bijepi se prabhavit sarkari amala or uske afasar ek or sidi jari kar yah prachaarit kar rahe he ki asli sidi ye he or mantri vaali sidi nakli he
 What is its purpose chhattisgarh police kii vishesh ruchi se saaf najar aa rahaa he ki sibiai jaanch ko bhi bhatakaane kii koshish to nahin ho rahi he
 For the time being, during the hearing of the bail plea of journalist Vinod Verma, all eyes are on what the Chhattisgarh police will keep

 bachche khilne ke dauraan sabakuch bhul jate hai
 They do not feel heat nor fatigue while playing but the heat and heat of the sun can prove dangerous for them
 garmi lagane se ek ore jahaan kamajori ho jaati he vahiin duusari ore kai bimariyon ke hone kaa khatra bhi bad jaataa he
 Now if there are children, we cannot stop them from playing and playing, but if you want, you can keep your children safe by adopting these measures
 aaie jaane, kaise bachaaya jaae bacchon ko garmi ke kahar se
 
 
 -the digestive power of children becomes weak during the summer season
 is dauraan bacchon ko diaria, lu lagane, pet main jalan hone, ulti hone, pilia hone, typhoid hone kii ashanka bad jaati he
 So take full care of children's food and give them a light, nutritious diet
 karen
 -while playing, children forget everything and keep playing without paying attention to the weather
 aise main dhyaan rakhen ki baccha tej dhoop yaa lu ke samay na khele
 Allow the child to go out only in the evening
 din main use indor game khilne ke liye kahen
 - In summer, mosquitoes and insects become very active in the evening
 aise main jab baccha khilne ja rahaa ho to use keedon or machharon se suraksha pradaan karne vaali kriim lagaakar hi baahar bhejein
 - Try not to let the child eat anything outside
 di-hydration se bachaane ke liye bacchon ko zyada se zyada liquid den
 Allow them to drink home-made juice, lemon water or coconut water
 bachche ko chacha, taaje falon kaa ras, milk shaike bhi de sakate hai
 Apart from this, cucumber, cucumber and watermelon can also be eaten
 inke seven se bachche ke sharir main pani kii kami nahin hogi
 - During the summer days, make children habit of bathing twice a day
 bachche ko sooti kapade hi pahanaaen or kapadon ko rojaanaa badalen
 If you come from outside, get his hands and feet thoroughly cleaned with soap
 aisa karne se sankraman kaa khatra kam ho jayega
 Take care of the cold and warm weather, eg, if the children come back after playing in the sun, do not let them sit in front of the cooler and do not give cold water immediately
 - garmi ke mausam menconjuctivitis hone kaa khatra bhi bad jaataa he
 Therefore, after a short interval, keep the eyes of the children washed with cold water
 isse bacchon kii ankhon main dryness bhi nahin hogi
 - Children often have heat and sunburn problems in summer

 It is a coincidence that the 21st General Conference of the leftist party CPM, which is struggling with political crisis and fighting to save its existence, is being held in Visakhapatnam on the Bay of Bengal
 vishakhapattanam khud pichhali 12 oktober ko aae chakravaati tufaan hudahud main barabaad ho gaya tha
 Life in Visakhapatnam has been back on track in the last 6 months, but the path is not so easy for CPM, which is losing one election after another
 party ke 21wein mahasammelan ke liye, jise party congress bhi kaha jaataa he, sipiem ke 800 pratinidhi deshbhar se vishakhapattanam main jamaa ho rahe hai
 This time's conference is important because Prakash Karat is retiring from this post after being in the post of CPM general secretary for nearly 10 years
 unke uttaradhikari ke taur par sipiem ke saansad or paulitte beuro sadsy seetaram yechuri kaa naam sabase aage chal rahaa he
 Though Prakash Karat spoke to NDTV India, the Central Committee in our party elects the General Secretary
 hamaari party main aisa nahin ho saktaa ki main apane uttaradhikari kaa naam ghoshit karun
 You will know the address of the next General Secretary on the last day of our Congress in Visakhapatnam
 karaat ke bayaan or party main sutron se baat karne par pataa chalata he ki mahasachiv pad ke liye aakhri daur kaa manthan to ‘party congress’ main hi hoga, lekin maujuuda halaat main yechuri ke mahasachiv banane kii sambhaavnaaen sabase adhik hai
 The party is the largest unit in the General Assembly, the 'party Congress'
 ‘party congress’ hi central cameti kaa chunaav karti he, jo kareeb 75 se 80 sadasyon kii nirnaayak body he
 The Central Committee can be compared to the National Executive of the BJP or the CWC of the Congress
 sipiem ke varisht netaa or party kii mahatvapurn central cameti ke sadsy neelotpal basu kaa kahana he, hamaari party main is baat kaa mahatv bahut adhik nahin he ki mahasachiv koun he, kyonki har bada faisla or party kii line central cameti hi tay karti he
 The job of the secretary-general is to implement it and set up a coordination
 ’vartmaan main paulitte beuro ke teen bade or varisht netaaon main prakaash karaat, esaaar pillai or seetaram yechuri hai
 All three were elected to the Politburo at the 'party Congress' held in Chennai in 1992
 us vakt party ke varisht netaaon kii soch thi ki seetaram yechuri ke mukhar chehre ke taur par rahenge, jo media ke saath-saath janata ke bich ranneeti kaa prachaar prasar karenge
 SR Pillai and Prakash Karat were basically put behind the scenes to form the party's strategy and 'backroom boy'
 2005 main harikishan singh surajeet ke ritair hone ke baad prakaash karaat ne kaman sanbhali
 The following year the party won heavily in Kerala and Bengal in 2006, but after that the CPM had to face frequent electoral defeats
 isiilie is ‘party congress’ main sipiem raajnneetik prastaav ke saath-saath party kii ranneeti par bhi charchaa karegi, jiske liye ek rivyuu report is ‘party congress’ main rakhi ja rahi he
 Last year, differences emerged between Sitaram Yechury and Prakash Karat over the mistakes in implementing the party line
 padhein :- sipiem main takaraav, karaat-yechuri main ubhare matbhed2004 loksabhaa chunaavon main sipiem ke paas 44 saansad the or vah loksabhaa main teesri sabase badi party thi
 Today it has only 9 mps
 bengal or kerala main party satta se baahar ho chuki he or keval tripura main hi uski sarkaar bachi he
 The party has to face elections in both Bengal and Kerala next year
 donon hi rajyon main sipiem ke saamne kadi chunauti he
 In such a situation, many in the party believe that it would be fine to make Sitaram Yechury the next General Secretary
 lekin sutara ye bhi kehete hai ki ek khemaa aakhri vakt main esato pillai kaa naam bhi aage badha saktaa he, jo ki variyata ke kram main karaat ke baad duusare number par hai
 Big eyes and long thick eyelids enhance the beauty of the entire face with eyes
 lekin har kisi ko aisi palken naseeb nahin hoti
 In such a situation, fake eyelashes are becoming a great trend among girls, but this does not make them a natural glow

 3

 By doing this, the blood circulation occurs well and their dirt is removed

 Investigators have raised serious questions on the number of terrorists who came to carry out the terror attack on Pathankot air base in Punjab
 hamale main shaamil aatankiyon kii sankhya 4 thi yaa 6, is par enie nishchit taur par kuch nahin kah paa rahi he
 According to a report in Hindustan Times, the National Security Guard, who gave a befitting reply to the terrorists at the base, says that they have killed six terrorists

 There are also questions about the number of terrorists, the number of terrorists involved in the attack on Pathankot airbase
 sarkaar ne is hamale main 6 aatankiyon ke maare jane kii baat kahi he
 Meanwhile, the Pakistani terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammad is the mastermind of the attack
 jaish ne jashn ke liye jo audio jari kiya usamen 4 aatankiyon kaa zikr kiya gaya he
 However, the investigating agencies are also assuming that Jem is making such claims to try to mislead the investigation
 pathankot main nae saal kaa pehla aatanki hamalagauratlab ho kiatankvaadido janvari tadake 3 baje land kruger or pagero gaadi se pathankot airbase pahunche the
 The terrorists were armed with heavy ammunition, including ak-47s, hand grenades, GPS systems, but their attack was thwarted by Mustaid security forces

 mohammad hafeez kii naabad ardhashtakeey pari or baayen haath ke spinner imaad wasim kii shandaar gendbaaji se pakistan ne somvaar ko kolkata main khele gaye world tii20 ke abhyaas cricket match main srilanka ko 15 ran se haraaya
 Pakistan was the last team to reach India for the tournament due to controversy over playing in Dharamshala and hence got a chance to play their first practice match
 uski team ne haalanki khel ke har kshetra main acha pradarshan karke khud ko srilanka se behatar sabit kiya
 After winning the toss, the Pakistani team came to bat first and scored 157 runs for five wickets thanks to Mohammad Hafeez's unbeaten 70 off 49 balls with the help of nine fours and a six
 iske baad wasim ne apni phiraki kazadu bikheraor chaar over main 25 ran dekar chaar wicket liye jisase srilanka kii team nau wicket par 142 ran tak hi pahunch pai
 Apart from Afridihafeez, Pakistan's top-order batsmen Sharjeel Khan (23), Ahmed Shehzad (18), Sarfraz Ahmed (13) and Umar Akmal (19) also got off to a good start but in an effort to score fast runs
 Lost his wickets

 Pakistan will play their first match in the World T20 against Bangladesh at the Eden Gardens on 16 March, while the Sri Lankan team will face Afghanistan on the same ground a day later
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal buudhvaar ko congress se vinati karte najar aae ki agar aam aadmi party or congress haath mila len to bijepi ko haraaya ja saktaa he
 It is a different matter that his plea was not for Delhi but for Haryana but its meaning is serious
 raajnneeti kii samaj rakhane vaale log bhi jaanate hai ki arvind kejariwal ko vinati karne ke mod main jaldi nahin dekha jaataa
 Despite this, they are trying to join the Congress in their court, then they will also understand its profit and loss
 logon ko tajjub isliye bhi he kyonki abhi haal main dilli congress adhyaksh shila dikshit ne do took kah diya ki aam aadmi party se koi alliance nahin hoga
 Now the question is, what is the compulsion that the Aam Aadmi Party has opened all its horses to tie up with the Congress? Take a dig at the Congress saying that there is no state in the country other than Delhi where the Aam Aadmi Party is stunned Give that we have a solid support base there
 is party ne kai rajyon main puri koshish kii magar uske siyaasi prayog munh ke bal gire hai
 Take Punjab and Goa as an example
 donon jagah aam aadmi party puri taiyaari main gai lekin goa main use bairang waapas lautnaa padaa
 Though the party performed well in the Punjab Lok Sabha elections, its dreams of a clean sweep remained in its wake
 bataa den ki punjab main loksabhaa kii 13 siten hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Aam Aadmi Party won 4 seats, Congress 3, Akali Dal 4 and BJP 1 seat
 punjab loksabhaa main acha kar chuki aam aadmi party vidhansabha chunaav main pichad gai
 It wants to compensate this backwardness from the coalition so that together they can defeat the BJP
 haryana ke raste dilli kaa safarub baat haryana kii
 The Aam Aadmi Party does not have a strong base in Haryana and the party is trying to enter here
 indian neshnal lokdal main foot ke baad jananaayak janata party (jejepi) kaa disambar main gathan hua tha
 Recently, JJP did well in the by-election in Jind assembly seat
 isi upachunaav main aam aadmi party ne jejepi ummidavaar kaa samarthan kiya tha lekin bijepi ummidavaar krishna laal midda 12248 voton se baaji maar gaye
 jjp's Digvijay Singh Chautala finished second
 yani bijepi number ek, jejepi number do or congress nabanr teen party rahi
 In this sense, the Aam Aadmi Party is thinking that if there is an alliance with Congress and JJP in Haryana, BJP can be easily defeated
 magar arvind kejariwal kii party ke saamne ahm sawaal ye he ki us bijepi ko kaise jawaab den jisane 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main 7 siton par kabja jamaaya tha jabaki ieneldi ko 2 or congress ko 1 seat par santosh karnaa padaa tha
 The Aam Aadmi Party is looking for the answer to this question in alliance with the Congress
 shila, tanvar se kaise ho bataisa nahin he ki arvind kejariwal buudhvaar ko achaanak haryana main gathbandhan ke liye congress se haath milaane ko taiyaar ho gaye
 Discussions of JJP and Aam Aadmi Party have been going on for the last several days there but the alliance has not reached any end
 kejariwal bhaleebhanti jaanate hai ki haryana main gathbandhan kii baat banati he to dilli main gathjod kii sambhaavna dur nahin hogi, lekin asli samasya ye he ki dilli main congress kii kaman aaj shila dikshit ke haath main he, to haryana main ashok tanvar adhyaksh hai
 If Arvind Kejriwal talks to these two leaders then how? In such a situation, Kejriwal is directly addressing Rahul Gandhi and hoping for an alliance

 i will play Test matches for the first time in England, so i am very excited
 ummid he ki main vahaan acha pradarshan karuunga

 It has become part of the tour, but in the end it all becomes meaningless
 aap maidan par jo karte ho, vahi myne rakhata he

 Singhal has demanded the removal of Ajay Maken from the Congress high command
 mangat ram singhl ek samay shila dikshit gut ke kaaphi prabhaavshaalee netaa rahe hai
 Even before Mangat Ram Singhal, several tall leaders and former ministers of Delhi have questioned Ajay Maken's way of working
 eke walia, harun yusuf, amarinder singh lavali, sandip dikshit jaise kuch bade naam hai jinke bare main kaha jaataa he ki vah ajay maakan ke kaam karne ke tareeke se naaraaz chal rahe hai
 This time no party has survived the bogeyman in the MCD ticket distribution

 We have an eternal relationship with the environment

 Life is impossible without environment

 There is no such example of coexistence
 lekin afsos ki aaj donon kaa astitv sankat main he
 This crisis is the result of imbalance in our relationship, and that is why today we need to celebrate international festivals like Earth Day and Environment Day

 Meanwhile, a major accident occurred on January 29, 1969 in Santa Barbara, California
 ek tel kuen main visphot ho gaya or badi maatra main tel or prakritik gas sataha par aa gaya
 This terrible oil spill opened everyone's eyes
 aise main nelson ke dimag main aayaa ki yadi vidhyaarthiyon kii shakti ko paryaavaran chetana ke saath jod diya jaae to paryaavaran kaa mudda rashtriya agenda main shaamil ho jayega
 In this sequence, Nelson announced the idea of national education on environment in the media
 unhone congress main sangrakshanvaadi soch rakhane vaale republican pratinidhi, peet macloski ko apane saath kaam karne ke liye taiyaar kiya, or denis hayes ko rashtriya samanvayak niyukt kiya
 Hayes hired 85 employees to spread the event across the country
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki 22 april ko do karod americanyon ne sadakon, udyanon or sabhakkshon main pahunch kar swasth, tikaoo paryaavaran ke liye apni aawaaj buland kii
 Thousands of colleges and universities organized demonstrations against the deteriorating environment
 1970 ke is prithvi diwas ko anoothaa raajnneetik samarthan mila
 Republicans and Democrats, poor and rich, urban and rural farmers, officials and labor leaders all supported the event
 is aayojan ne sanyukt raashtra main paryaavaran sangrakshan agency ke gathan kaa maarg prashast kiya
 On March 21, 1971, United Nations secretary-general u Thant declared Earth Day an international event

 Nearly 200 million people from 141 countries around the world participated in celebrations for environmental protection
 varsh 1992 main rio di generio main sanyukt raashtra prithvi shikhar sammelan hua
 President Bill Clinton later conferred the President's Medal of Freedom - 1995 to establish Earth Day
 paryaavaran sangrakshan ke aadhunik andolan kii yah varshganth ab har varsh 22 april ko prithvi diwas ke rup main manaai jaati he
 There are various types of government-non-governmental events
 ham dharti va paryaavaran ko bachaane kaa sankalp lete hai
 Programs ranging from tree planting to rivers, ponds and cleanliness of their surroundings are organized
 janajagarukta abhiyaan, sabha, sangoshtiyaan va sammelan yojit kiye jate hai
 The tradition of the festival is well established in India
 rashtriya, kshetreey, aanchalik sabhi str ke tyohaar hai or ab hamaare saath antarrashtriya tyohaar bhi aa jude hai
 All our festivals are made in terms of nature and environment
 hamaare yahaan hameshaa se pedo, nadiyon, talabon, va prithvi kii puja hoti rahi he or aaj bhi hoti he
 But the modern society, which has read a bit, threw these traditions into the dustbin by calling it orthodox and today its garbage and garbage is falling on us
 yahi padhaa-likhaa tabaka aise antarrashtriya tyoharon kii aguai kar rahaa he
 But if we have to truly save the earth and the environment, save ourselves, then we have to rekindle our traditions, eternal consciousness
 anyathaa ek din kaa antarrashtriya prithvi diwas mahaj aupchaarikta se zyada kuch nahin hoga

 com / u0peiawlvs Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi is going to be the president of the party soon
 aazaadee ke baad congress main abtak 16 adhyaksh hue hai or rahul gandhi ke party ke 19wein adhyaksh hone ja rahe hai
 Sonia Gandhi has presided over the party in the Congress, the same year as Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, all three have jointly held the post of President
 38 saal se gandhi parivaar kaa raajcongress party main 19 saal se sonia adhyaksh hai, jabaki nehru 4 saal, indira 8 saal or rajeev gandhi 7 saal tak adhyaksh rah chuke hai
 It is clear that in the 70 years of independence, only 38 years of Gandhi family has been the party president
 baaki bache 32 saal main jebi kriplani, pi sitarmaiya, purushottam das tandon se lekar kamraj, jagjeevanram or pivi narsimha raav, seetaram kesari ne bhi adhyaksh pad sambhala
 From the past to the future, to the future 61 years before independence i
e
 from 1985 to 1946, in the Congress, 50 presidents were formed and in this list of president, from Gokhale to Mahatma Gandhi, Abdul Kalam Azad and Sardar Patel to Madan Mohan Malviya, Lala Lajpat Rai, Dada Bhai Naoroji and Subhash Chandra Bose to Rajendra Prasad were the presidents
 to rahul gandhi apane parivaar ke alaava bhi aazaadee ke ladaai main shamilanetaaon se sikh lekarparty kii kaman sambhaal sakate hai
 There were only 4 women, only four women held the post of president in the presidential party
 inamen ani bensot, sarojini naidu, indira gandhi or sonia shaamil hai
 In this list of presidents, two women who were Congress presidents before Sonia and Indira, Annie Bensat in 1917 and Sarojini Naidu in 1925
 congress adhyakshon kaa ye itihaas dikhalaataa he ki ek vakt congress hi desh kaa praryay thi
 But at present, the Congress is the weakest in its realization and after 19 years, when the Congress is in the hands of Rahul from Sonia Gandhi, then there will be three questions regarding Rahul Gandhi
 viraasat, punarjagran or sangharsh
 Only by meeting these three criteria, Rahul will be able to salvage the Congress at the present time
 modi lahar se nipatane kii chunauteeparty jis haal main abhi he vahaan se sangharsh bahut kadaa karnaa hoga, kyonki deshbhar main modi lahar aisi he ki congress mukt bharat kaa sapana sanjoe bijepi janamanas kii bich ja pahunchi he
 The Congress will also need a new awakening in its cadre, as the role of the opposition has been shrinking in recent times and it will have to fight the battle not only to the Parliament but to the streets
 beete kuch dinon main rahul gandhi main wo josh dikhaa bhi he jisase lagata he ki wo aage aakar kaman sanbhaalane ko taiyaar hai
 But after the post, there will also be a challenge to take the party, cadre and public together

 The International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague, Netherlands has ruled Kulbhushan Jadhav
 isije ne pakistan ko bada jhatka dete hue kulbhushan jadhav kii faansee par roak laga di he or phir se vichaar karne ko kaha he
 Along with this, the ICJ has also ruled that Kulbhushan Jadhav will be allowed councilor access
 16 jaj is maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe the, jisamen se 15 ne bharat ke paksh main faisla sunaaya
 Now the biggest question is what will happen if Pakistan does not accept the decision of ICJ
 sanyukt raashtra charter ke anuchhed 94 main kaha gaya he ki sanyukt raashtra ke sabhi sadasyon ko un maamalon main isije ke nirnyon kaa paalan karnaa hoga jinamein ve pakshakaar hai
 India and Pakistan have signed it
 ye bhi padhein-agar kulbhushan par ICJ kaa faisla nahin mana to pakistan kaa kya hoga ?pakistan ne vienna kanvension kaa ulanghan karte hue jadhav ko counsar acces nahin diya tha
 The Vienna Convention has an alternative protocol, after which those who sign the treaty are obliged to obey it at the time of the dispute
 pakistan or bharat donon isamen party hai
 The orders given by the ICJ are binding
 lekin ab yahaan par siddhanton or vaastaviktaa main antar he
 In 2004, the ICJ ruled on 51 Mexico citizens
 us samay america ne court trial main in sabhi 51 nagarikon ko doshi mana tha
 The US Supreme Court refused to believe it and said that the decision cannot bypass national laws
 saal 2005 main america ne khud ko is vaikalpik protocol se baahar kar liya
 ICJ decisions are binding but they cannot force countries to accept the decision
 agar pakistan isije ke faisle ko nahin maanata he to phir united neshans security council (yuanessi) kaa role ahm ho jayega
 Read also: icj's decision on Kulbhushan Jadhav gave Pakistan not one or two, but the entire three setbacks UNSC may force Pakistan to accept icj's decision
 lekin yahaan par pech china he
 It is mostly expected that China will go with its friend Pakistan
 doosraa ye bhi he ki yuanessi isamen dakhal karne se inkaar kar detaa he
 Then there will be no way in this matter
 teesraa, suraksha parishad ke upaay ko tabhi hi apanaaya ja saktaa he jab antarrashtriya shanti or suraksha daanv par ho

 notebandi ko lekar desh main bhale hi koharaam machaa ho lekin chhattisgarh main bastar ke adivasee apni mouj masti main he
 They are buying all the goods they need daily in the Haat markets
 naa to unke paas 500 or ek hajaar kaa note he or naa hi kaala dhan
 Due to which the impact of demonetisation has not been done on these tribals
 bastar ke hot bazaar notebandi se beasar dikhaai de rahaa he, aamtaur par chhattisgarh ke duusare jilon ke chote-bade haat bazaaron main notebandi se kahi aanshik to kahi acha-khaasaa asar daalaa he
 But in the Bastar markets, the brightness remains as before
 salphi kii he maangayahan ke haat bazaaron kii pahchaan salphi he, ise adivaasiyon kaa desi bear kaha jaataa he
 This beverage originating from tree plants remains in demand in the market as before
 yahi haal sagasubjiyon kaa bhi he, bazaar main naa to khule paison kii koi dikkat he, or naa hi bade noton kii
 In this market of tribals, even today a hundred note is considered the biggest, traders are taking it in hand
 nahin hui dincharya prabhavitin haat bazaar ko dekh kar nahin lagata kii notebandi main adivaasiyon kii dincharya ko jaraa bhi prabhavit kiya he
 In this era of modernity, these tribals still give importance to traditional things
 lihaaja haat bazaaron main hissaa lene vaale vyapaaree inaki zaruraton kaa saamaan laana nahin bhoolatey
 These markets include everything from women's makeup to men's daily use
 pehle ye adivasee namak or mirchi ke badale main chirunji, kaashew or kai keemtee jadibutiyaan vyapaariyon ko de diya karte the
 Because there was no cash in their hands
 lekin maujuuda daur main adivaasiyon kii aay bhi badi he, lihaaja bastar ke tamaam haat bazaaron main 100,50 daise noton kaa chalan he
 Naxalites also keep an eye on Bastar's Haat markets
 chunki in dinon naksali apane paas maujuud 500 or 1000 ke noton ko khapaane kii jugat bitha rahe he
 Therefore, the deployment of police personnel in plain uniform is in these hot markets
 wo khariddaaron se lekar vyapaariyon tak ke aapasi lenden par najar rakhe hue he
 The police suspect that the Naxalites may snatch only the 50 and 100 notes held by the tribals somewhere to consume as many as 500 and 1000 notes

 The issue was raised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself

 darbhanga se bijepi ke vidhayak sanjay saravagine rajya sarkaar se maang kii he ki wo shmashaanon ke vikaas ke liye bajatiy upbandh kare lekin sarkaar iske liye taiyaar nahi he

 The government is reviewing it
 shravan kumaar ne kaha ki vidhayak mukhyamantri kshetra vikaas ke tahat milane vaale 2 crores rupe kii raashi main shmashaan ke vikaas par kharch kar sakate he lekin bijepi samaaj main tanaav failaane ke liye is tarah ke mudde uthaa rahi he
 However, the work of siege of cemeteries began in Bihar when the BJP and Janata dal-u coalition government was in Bihar
 sarkaar ne us samay ye faisla samuhik rup se liya tha lekin ab bihar main maha gathbandhan kii sarkaar he
 In such a situation, BJP is trying to take advantage of this issue by linking it with Hindutva

 congress kii mukhyamantri pad kii ummidavaar shila dikshit ne yuva akhilesh yadav ke paksh main is mukaable se hatane kii peshkash kii he
 Soon after the announcement of election dates for five states, including Uttar Pradesh, Congress hinted to keep its coalition options open with SP to prevent fascist forces from coming to power

 If that happens, i would definitely like to see a young Chief Minister in Uttar Pradesh

 Sheela said that if the news of Akhilesh leading the election campaign is correct, then it would be appropriate for me to withdraw from the race
 vah yuva or anbhavi hai
 However, she rejected suggestions that she was being made a scapegoat in Uttar Pradesh as she would follow the party's decision and be asked to follow it

 ’ vah yahaan ek kaarykram main bol rahe the
 Respected Fadnavis, kya aapane aisa kaha he ki 'agar aap is desh main rahanaa chaahate hai to aapako bharat mata kii jai kahana hoga varanaa aapako yahaan rahane kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 'what a good thing you have said, Vidya cannot swear
 main yah jai bolne vaali dhamkee auron se bhi sun chukaa hum
 i have been speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai before and i will speak further but after you have some questions, after which the process of speaking Jai will be clear
 isliye yah patr likh rahaa hum
 If you do not like it, then get an FIR done
 main zamaanat bhi nahin karavaauungaa
 Honorable Chief Minister, will you tell me when to speak Bharat Mata ki Jai? kahaan bolnaa he or kitni baar bolnaa he
 Whenever you have to speak, you have to speak once or speak three times
 din bhar main kitni baar bolnaa he
 To speak slowly is to speak out loud
 subah uthte hi bolnaa he yaa nahaane ke baad bolnaa he
 Speak before breakfast or after breakfast
 lift main bolnaa he yaa parking main bolnaa he
 Speak at red light or speak at green light
 raste main bolnaa he yaa daftar pahunchakar bolnaa he
 Speak at lunch or at dinner
 chaay kii dukaan par bolnaa he yaa restraan main bolnaa he
 Speak on someone's sight or speak in private
 apane se bolnaa he yaa kisi ke kehane par bolnaa he
 Speak in the rally or speak in the valley
 metro rail main kab bolnaa he or bhartiya rail main kab bolnaa he
 When to speak in the hospital, when to speak in the shop
 oparation se pehle bolnaa he yaa oparation ke baad bolnaa he
 Speak in ICU or speak in OPD
 doctor ko dekhte bolnaa he yaa nurse ko dekhte bolnaa he
 Speak when there is a drought or you should speak when you are hail
 tufaan aane par bolnaa he yaa bukamp aane par bolnaa he
 Go to China or speak to Japan
 pakistan jaakar bolnaa he yaa turkmenistan jaakar bolnaa he
 Go to Cuba or speak to Ghana
 duutavas main bolnaa he yaa sanyukt raashtra main bolnaa he
 My list is getting longer, people who want to call Jai, they should not persecute Jai speakers
 jo nahin bolnaa chaahate na bolen lekin jo bolnaa chaahate hai unhen to dishanirdesh den ki kab-kab, kahaan-kahaan or kaise-kaise bolnaa he
 You have said that whoever does not speak does not have the right to live here
 kya aap bataayenge ki nahin bolne vaale kahaan jaakar rahenge
 They will go out on their own or you will arrange to send
 videsh mantralay se visa dilwakar bhejenge yaa samudri naav main daalkar bhejenge
 Which countries have you identified so far to send those who do not speak Bharat Mata Ki Jai? kya aap party fund se bhijwayenge yaa sarkari fund se
 Now those who are ready to speak
 mujhe lagata he jo bharat mata kii jai bolnaa chaahate hai unki aap or aapaki sarkaar ghor upeksha kar rahi he
 What will you give them to live instead of speaking
 makaan denge yaa dukaan denge
 How many people have been given home so far? How many people have given jobs to Jai? You will know that the Prime Minister speaks Bharat Mata ki Jai at every election meeting
 unke saath sab bolte hai
 When people's enthusiasm is low, the Prime Minister clenches his fists and says that speak loudly with me
 lakhon log unke saath jor se bolte hai
 Not even a man says that he will not speak
 kya aapane kabhi pradhanmantri ko yah kehete suna he ki jo nahin bolegaa use lathi se maarenge, desh main nahin rahane denge
 It seems from your words that you do not listen to the speech of the Prime Minister till the end, either go off the stage or your attention is elsewhere
 ummid he aap mere patr kaa jawaab denge, jo bolnaa chaahate hai unke liye uchit vyavastha karenge
 Why are you focusing all the attention on the one who does not speak
 aisa nahin hona chahie ki aap na bolne vaale ko sazaa dene main hi biji rahen or bolne vaale ko inaam dena bhul jaayen
 a citizen who loves your state and its language
