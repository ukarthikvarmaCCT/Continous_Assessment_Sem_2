 At the same time, since section 144 has been implemented in Jammu, the prices of vegetables have increased
 srinagar kii tulana main jammu main halaat kaabo main hai, lekin rosemara kii chizon ke daam dogune ho gaye hai
 The supply of vegetables and fruits from outside the state has been disrupted
 jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataane ke modi sarkaar ke faisle ko lekar twitor par saamne aayaa congress netaaon kaa dwand ab saarvajanik kaaryakramon main bhi jhalkane laga he
 Then young leaders like Jyotiraditya Scindia opposed this decision and caught the opposite line of the party, but now leaders like Jairam Ramesh and Shashi Tharoor, who were in the Manmohan cabinet, have questioned the party's strategy, that too from the public forum
 congress netaa jairam ramesh ne guuruuvaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kaary ke mahatv ko sweekaar karne kii salaah di or kaha ki unke shashan kaa model puri tarah se nakaaratmak gaatha nahin he
 Ramesh went a step further and praised PM Modi's language to connect with the people and also said that nothing will be achieved by presenting him like a villain all the time
 ramesh ke bayaan par charchaa chal hi rahi thi ki shashi tharur ne bhi isi tarah kaa bayaan de diya
 Now the question is, will the Congress, which is going through the worst phase since its inception, change its strategy to compete with PM Modi? Congress has lost its way in opposition, although Congress leaders are refraining from speaking anything on this subject, but They are also saying in suppressed language that the party is going astray from its principles, its path in opposition to Modi
 loktantr main vipaksh kii bhoomika sarkaar ke har kaary kaa virodh karnaa nahin
 It is the duty of the opposition to oppose wrong steps, so also to support good works
 haalia kuch varshon main congress raajnneetik napha-nuksaan kaa akalan kiye bagaiyr sarkaar ke lagbhag har faisle ke khilaaf khadi rahi he
 The party has also suffered extensive losses
 jairam ramesh or shashi tharur se pehle bhi is tarah kii aawaaj uthati rahi he
 According to experts, if the Congress has to move towards regaining its lost political land, it will have to change its strategy
 rahul gandhi chunaav prachaar ke dauraan modi par hamalavar rahe
 In the 2014 elections too, the Congress campaign was Modi-centric in a way and Modi had defeated every attack on himself in his favor
 bhartiya janata party bhi har chunaav ko piem modi ke chehre par kendrit karnaa chaahati he, bhale hi vah kisi rajya kaa vidhansabha chunaav hi kyon na ho
 The Congress has also been making the bjp's path easier by becoming Modi-based instead of making the campaign campaign of every election issue-based by getting entangled in the woven political net of the BJP
 aise main congress alaakaman kaa ranneeti main badlaav karnaa aavashyak mana ja rahaa he
 The Finance Ministry has asked all ministries to strictly follow budgetary discipline
 mantralay kaa kahana he ki rajkoshiya sthiti tang hone ke kaaran atirikt kosh uplabdh karana sambhav nahin hoga
 a finance ministry official said, "we have asked all the ministries to run the allocated funds in the 2012-13 budget and refuse to ask for additional funds
" ’’ vitt mantralay ne chaalu vitt varsh ke sanshodhit anumaan taiyaar karte samay kendriya mantralayon ko yah sanket diya
 The revised estimate will be tabled in Parliament during the 2013-14 budget

 "at the time of revised estimates, various ministries provide expenditure estimates for the entire financial year
 tippaniyan Several officials of the Finance Ministry have already indicated that the fiscal deficit for the government is 5 billion according to the budgetary estimate

 The financial problems of the government are increasing due to increasing spending on subsidies, slow pace of tax recovery growth and the disinvestment program not catching pace
 vitt mantralay ke ek adhikari ne kaha, ‘‘hamane sabhi mantralayon se 2012-13 ke bajet main aavantit dhan se kaam chalaane ko kaha he or atirikt dhanrashi maangane se manaa kiya he

 From this analysis, many people may be questioning that perhaps i do not consider Kohli a good cricketer and believe that no one can break Sachin's record? When Sunil Gavaskar became the first player to score 10,000 runs in Tests, people were saying that this record of Gavaskar would not be broken, but this record of Gavaskar was broken, and broken many times
 ab test cricket main kai khilaadi das hajaar se bhi zyada ran bana chuke hai
 The same happened with Kapil Dev when he set a record of taking 431 wickets in Test cricket
 tab aisa lag rahaa tha ki shaayad is record ke aasapaas koi gendbaaj nahin pahunch paaegaa
 But many bowlers broke this record of Kapil
 srilanka ke muthaiya muralidharan ne sirf 133 test maichon main 800 wicket hasil kiye hai
 India's leg-spinner Anil Kumble has also taken 619 wickets
 shen warn ko 708 test wicket mili hai
 Kapil Dev is now in seventh position
 pehle bhi kah chukaa hum or ab bhi kah rahaa hum ki maujuuda daur main viraat kohli kii ballebaaji dekhte hue aisa lagane laga he ki aage jaakar vah kai record bana bhi sakate hai or kai record tod bhi sakate hai, lekin sachin kaa record todane ke liye viraat ko sirf tii 20 main nahin balki test or vanade main bhi acha pradarshan karnaa padegaa, vah bhi lagaataar lambey samay tak
 i have said it before and i am still saying that looking at the batting of Virat Kohli in the current round, it seems that going ahead he can make many records and can break many records, but to break Sachin's record Virat will not only have to perform well in T20 but also in Tests and odis, that too for a long time

 Australia, Germany dominated the Champions Trophy
 The tournament, which started in 1978, is held once in two years and since then Australia has been the undisputed king of the tournament
 ab tak is pratishthit trophy ko sabase adhik 13 baar australian team ne hi jeeta he
 The past five editions have not challenged him
 australia is saal lagaataar chhathi baar yah khitaab jeetna chahega
 It is followed by Germany, which has won this title nine times
 netherlands kii team aath baar champion rahi he
 This year the Belgian team is taking part in the Champions Trophy
 is team ne isse pehle sirf 2012 main hi is toornament main hissaa liya he or paanchaven sthaan par rahi thi
 He defeated Germany in the playoffs
 german team 2009 ke baad yah khitaab nahin jeet saki he
 Who are the winning contenders This year, however, the Giants are not predicting the victory of any one team
 kaha ja rahaa he ki is saal koi bhi team khitaab jeet sakati he
 The name being placed at the top of this order is Belgium, which is at number four in the world rankings and has been influencing every position with its game
 pakistan se lekar bharat ko khitaab kaa daavedaar mana ja rahaa he lekin australia, jo ki nai team ke saath maidan main utraa he, ko is daud main sabase aage rakhkar dekha ja rahaa he
 The reason for this is that the figures are in favor of Australia in every sense
 yah team 13 baar khitaab jeet chuki he or lagaataar paanch baar se champion rahi he
 Australia also has the best win-loss record
 usne apane 58 fisadi match jite hai
 In second place is the Netherlands, which has won 56 per cent of its matches
 iske baad germany kaa sthaan he, jisane 50 fisadi se adhik match jite hai
 The Indian team could win only 34 percent of the matches

 By the way, in the days spent in his jail visit, Lalu kept thinking about the current situation in the country and the new political thinking emerging these days
 jahaan tak gathbandhan kaa prashn he to lalu yadav upie ke saath rahete hue hi aagaamee loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladenge
 Maintaining Muslim votes is going to prove to be the biggest challenge before him
 sahanubhuti kii lahar par savaar lalu yadav apane khoye hue em-vaai sameekaran ko phir se punerjeevit karne kaa prayaas karenge
 Talking about Lok Sabha elections, Nitish Kumar's trouble can certainly increase
 ek ore jahaan nitish kaa bijepi se chhattis kaa aankada he, vahiin duusari ore lalu kii sahanubhuti lahar unka khel bigaad sakati he
 The BJP riding the 'namo' wave may also have to change its electoral strategy when Lalu Yadav comes out
 kyonki lalu yadav kii gaiyrhaaziri main unki ladaai sirf or sirf nitish sarkaar se thi
 In such a situation, he will have to fight on two front simultaneously
 lalu bhi adwani kaa rath rokane kaa hawala dekar ek baar phir se bihar kii raajnneeti main chaane kaa prayaas karenge
 At the same time, Congress is struggling to find strong regional satraps in view of the Lok Sabha elections due to corruption allegations
 aise main congress lalu yadav ke khilaaf chal rahe maamlo main dhilaai barat sakati he
 The latest example of which is proved by Lalu Yadav getting bail, where the CBI did not register any specific protest against his bail application
 congress yah prayaas jarur karegi ki kam se kam bihar main jahaan kabhi vah sarvesarva rahi thi, vahaan lalu yadav ke kandhon par savaar hokar do-chaar siten apane naam kar le
 In the current situation when rallies for the Lok Sabha elections have been organized and every party is looking to strengthen its support base and in search of strong allies, Lalu Yadav's coming out of jail can give far-reaching consequences for Indian politics

 The central government's new ordinance on the Land Acquisition Act in many villages is causing resentment among farmers and a dispute is feared
 chhatarpur ke raajpur khurd gaanv main koi 50 kisaan ek meeting main apane gusse kaa izhaar bhi kar rahe hai or halaat se nibatane ke liye planning bhi kar rahe hai
 Rajpur Khurd is a village where land acquisition started 34 years ago
 kaagazon par zamin lee gai, lekin asal main kabza mul maalikon ke paas hi rahaa
 Some of these people also took compensation, but since the land remained with the original owners and the government did not take possession of it, people started building it after a few years
 aaj raajpur khurd ek behad ghani basii hui colony he, lekin nae adhyadesh ke baad yahaan sarkaar kaa danda chal saktaa he
 According to the Land Acquisition Act enacted last year under the UPA government, if the government or a company acquires land, it will have to take possession of the land and start work by giving compensation within five years
 agar sarkaar ke paas qabza nahin he yaa prabhavit zamin maalik ko muawza nahin diya gaya he to paanch saal baad zamin waapas kerani hogi, lekin raajpur khurd jaise gaanvon ke halaat vivaad khadey karenge
 There are 120 villages like Rajpur Khurd in Delhi, where the cases are in court
 nayaa kanoon aane ke baad inamen se 90 fisadi maamalon main zamin mul zamin maalik ke paas laut jaati, lekin ab centre sarkaar ke nae adhyadesh ke section 24 (e) main die gaye praavdhaanon se malikana haq sarkaar ke paas hoga
 It seems that these conditions can also take electoral color before the Delhi Assembly elections

 Rahane gave an example of a 262-run partnership with Virat Kohli in Melbourne in 2014-15, saying that Australia's focus is only on India's star batsman helping other batsmen do their work from one end
 unhone kaha ,‘har ballebaaj kaa kaam team ke liye yogadan dena he
 We have to build long partnerships like last time
 isse australia main siries jeetne main madad milegi

 a Facebook user wrote, "this is the saddest photo of the Internet today
" ”is photo ko bhi kai logon ne share kiya he
 Another picture of Zohra is also going viral
 isamen bhi kamobesh yahi likhaa gaya he
 Zohra arrived home from school crying in 2017 when she received the news of her father's death
 zohara ke haathon main mehandi rachi thi kyonki tab uski badi bahan kii shaadi honevaali thi
 Zohra's father, Abdul Rashid Pir, was employed in the Jammu and Kashmir Police and was killed by the firing of terrorists in Anantnag
 roti hui zohara kii tasviir logon ke dilon ko chhu gai or cricketer gautam gambhir ne zohara kii padhai kaa zimmaa le liya tha

 Along with the game, Azhar's name also comes in match fixing, due to which his popularity ends in an instant, there is a court case in the case of fixing and all these incidents have been tried through the film
 
 script:-film bhootpurv cricketer mohammad ajaharuddin kii jindagi par aadhaarit he, or cinema kii liberty lete hue ise kaaphi sajaayaa bhi gaya he lekin kehani ke dauraan aap ajahar ke imoshans se khud ko conect nahin kar pate, rajat aroda ke likhe hue doylog kaaphi banaavati se najar aate hai, jahaan ek taraf mairi com, or milkha singh kii byopic ban chuki he, to is film kii tulana, us tarah kii byopic filmon se honi lazim he

 For Nitish, this yatra is being done to review the development work done in the state, but former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav considers the visit something else
 tejasvi ke liye yah vikaas samiksha yatra nahin balki dimak yatra he
 So the question arises that after all why is Tejashwi Yadav calling Nitish's development problem journey a termite journey? Tejashwi asks Nitish that what is the development of the state by taking such a journey? Tejashwi wants to know from Nitish where there is development other than scams in Bihar? Tejashwi believes that he has set out on this journey to overcome the grudge that Nitish raped the mandate given to the grand alliance

 Tejashwi did not stop, further said that Nitish has installed the termites and leaks in his system of 13 years in a systematic manner in the system so that he can hollow out the system and suck the blood of the people, his activism Nitish has set out on this journey to know

 Tejashwi asks that when scams are happening on scams in every department and every ministry, what does Nitish do in his departmental review meeting? Does Nitish teach the virtues of how to cover the scam in these review meetings? Tejashwi tweeted, 'atonement trip to Nitish ji, not for the development journey but for not completing the previously announced work and robbing the mandate' 'must leave at

 centre main modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad bade kad or jimmedaariyon ke lihaaj se jo kuch naam pramukhataa se ubhare hai, unamem ek cheharaa sanskaar bharti ke rashtriya sah sanghathan mantri 54 varshiya amir chand kaa bhi he
 He is an RSS pracharak for 32 years
 kendriya or ab to dasiyon rajyon main bhi saanskrithik sansthaanon ke sheersh padon or samitiyon kii saikadon niyuktiyon ke dauraan unki raay behad ahm maani jaati rahi he
 Recently, in 2-3 meetings with Shivkesh, he also answered some 'difficult' questions with impunity
 kin muddon par baat honi thi?javaabah mulaakaat abhi honi he
 The Prime Minister advocates immediate and long-term plans
 aaj ek saanskrithik parivesh kaa hona bahut jaruri he
 It will be about cultural policy
 sawaalh sanskaar bharti, aresas kaa saanskrithik agenda kya he?javaabah sanskaar bharti kaa maananaa he ki kala hi jivan he
 a hundred years ago it was twisted and told that art is for art
 isse hamaari matbhinnata he
 It is hidden in the demonstrative and visual arts arising out of the soil of India that the common people should enjoy, rather than hurt, our works
 yahaan to kisaan, majdoor bhi thakne ke baad raat ko gaakar, naachakar halke ho jate hai
 a person without art, society, civilization will be cruel
 aaj jin samskritiyon main kala par pabandi he, vahiin samasya bad rahi he
 America is spending so much on dealing with terrorism
 isaki bajaae vah un ilaakon main kala ko protsaahit karwaae yaa vahaan jo kalakarm main lage hai, ve karte rahen, isi kaa intjaam karvaa de to zyada bhala hoga
 See, Akbar was an art lover, there was respect for the arts in his court
 vahiin aurangzeb ko or uske bare main janata kii raay dekhie
 Question: Art has to do with sensations
 javaabah purvottar main rahete hue ek baar main paasi ghat (arunachal pradesh) main snaatak kii ek chaatra se milane gaya
 When i started touching her colorful loom, she stopped, saying that you are a man
 hamaari samskruti main purushon kaa kaam shikaar karnaa or sankat aane par laduya he
 If he starts doing this work of art then he will become more sensitive, he will have difficulty in getting his original work done
 sawaalh par desh ke samskruti mantri mahesh sharma pichley dinon aksar vivaadaaspad vaktavyon se bakheda khadaa karte rahe
 You didn't think they needed to explain anything on this? Answer: They are public representatives
 hamase pehle janata ne hi unhen samajha diya
 No school is bigger than the public
 kala main jis tarah se shrotaaon-darshakon kii pratikriya paimaana he, usee tarah se raajnneeti main janata bhi mahasoos kara detii he ki jan pratinidhi kahaan galat yaa sahi kar rahaa he
 Question: Why is there so much hatred towards right-wing thinking, especially towards Muslims? Answer: This notion is wrong
 or ye dakshinpanthi-vampanthi jumale 100-150 varshon kii upaj hai
 There has never been such a camp in India
 aisa jaan-boojhkar kiya gaya he
 Now as the sun of nationalism intensifies, this notion will prove to be wrong
 sawaalh desh ke sheershasth chitrakaaron main se ek em
 F
 hossain or filmkaar deepa mehta ke khilaaf 'safal' andolan kii jameen taiyaar karne kaa shrey sangh parivaar main saanskrithik prashaasak, naatakkaar di
 P
 sinha ko diya jaataa rahaa he
 Now your name came behind the campaign to lead Anupam Kher against the withdrawal of the prize
 iskaa shrey lete hai aap?javaabah puraskaar vaapasi ke mudde par desh ko yah laga ki duniya main bharat kii jo saakh ban rahi he, yah us par batta lagane kaa ek shadyantr he
 Hence the agitation led by Kher, (madhur) Bhandarkar and (narendra) Kohli et cetera
 usamen antardhage ke rup main hamaari bhoomika ko shrey jaataa he to sweekaar he
 Question: In a meeting with the top officials of the Sangh, you pulled the perks of benefiting, say
 jawaab kya mila aapako?javaabah parikrama waalon par parakram karne waalon ko ahmiyat milani hi chahie
 Nobody can bypass the truth
 sach kabhi nuksaan bhi nahin pahunchaata
 Question: How do the Sangh, the Ministry of Culture, Sanskar Bharti, create coordination among all? Answer: Since the direction of thinking of everyone is one, there are discussions among themselves
 sawaalh sanskaar bharti kii dilli ikai main ek tabaka kalakaaron ko ahmiyat dene ke aapke ravaie ke khilaaf he, bataate hai
 Answer: Suppose they have little understanding
 vaise bhi parivartan main bal lagata he, samay lagata he
 Will have to be so patient
 sawaalh aapke pasandida lekhak koun hai?javaabah zyada pard nahin paata par mahadevi verma kaa gadhy mujhe bahut pasand he

 After that catastrophe, many parents lost their lap and many children were orphaned

 Talking to journalists in Patna, Lalu alleged that the hoarders, being a long open border between Bihar and Nepal, are hoarding large quantities of essential commodities and sending them to Nepal in collaboration with the authorities
 lalu ne kaha ki unki party is par roak ke liye seemaa kii ore march karegi
 He said that he himself would visit the border areas of the state and deploy party workers at checkposts to monitor the items being sent to Nepal
 unhone kaha ki ve kendriya grih mantri pi chidambaram ko jald hi ek patr likhenge or unase is maamle main hastkshep kii maang karenge
 The RJD supremo also blamed the state government for smuggling essential commodities to Nepal through Bihar and said that they have also learned that the smuggled goods to Nepal are being brought back to Bihar and sold at expensive prices
 
 lalu ne kaha ki mahangaai ko lekar unki party dwaara 28 janvari ko yojit bihar band ko jo jansamarthan mila, usase spasht ho gaya he ki nitish kumaar sarkaar ke ab ginati ke din bache hai or agle vidhansabha chunaav main pradesh kii janata use satta se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa degi
 Arun Jaitley did not agree
 bijepi kii chunaav samiti kii baithak main aaj bhi nahin pahunche jetali
 The BJP, which has so far defied the rift in the party, is now looking for a formula
 formula ye ki jetali bhi maan jaaen or party adhyaksh rajnath singh kii bhi kirakiri naa ho
 The election committee of the Bharatiya Janata Party had an important meeting in Delhi
 party tay karne baithi thi dilli, uttar pradesh, gujarat, rajasthan, madhya pradesh jaise rajyon kii siton ke liye ahm pratyaashiyon ke naam
 All the maharathis of the party reached the meeting but Arun Jaitley, called bjp's Chanakya, was missing
 saaf he ki adwani or rajnath ke daawey ke ulat jetali kii naaraazgi khatm nahin hui
 Now that everything is clear like glass, LK Advani says that this is a minor matter
 khayr, kam se kam adwani ne to mana bijepi main kuch chal rahaa he, maamuli hi sahi
 Now what is the solution for this? Jaitley demands that Sudhanshu Mittal be removed from the post of in-charge of the Northeast
 mittal kii niyukti bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh ne khud kii he
 The removal of Sudhanshu Mittal means the defeat of Rajnath
 aise main formula ye talasha ja rahaa he ki naa kisi kii haar ho naa jeet, sab kuch sulajh jaae
 According to sources, the formula for this has been derived that Sudhanshu Mittal will be discharged and then a committee formed in Jaitley's operations will be dissolved, with Rajnath being displeased by the appointment of some members

 bihar topper ghotaale main ek or chaunkaane vaali baat saamne ai he
 It is alleged that the school from which Ganesha has passed the matriculation examination has been infamous for fraudulent use for the last 40 years
 ajtak kii teamsmastipur ke lakshminiyapahunchi to ye hairaan karne vaali jaankaree saamne ai
 Investigation revealed that in this school, about 80 to 100 students were admitted in matriculation every year
 magar pariksha kaa rigelt 300-400 chaatr-chaatraon kaa aata tha
 School teacher Vijay Kumar Chaudhary said that there are about 100 admissions in the school every year
 lekin skool ke sanchaalak ramkumar choudhary or unki patni devkumari patna, jharkhand, dilli or pashchim bengal ke takreeban 250 se 300 bacchon ko farji tareeke se admician dete hai
 Also, there was no record of such students in the attendance register of the school
 ganeshane khud mana he ki usne giridih se 1990 main metric kii pariksha paas kii or phir koderma se 1992 main intermediat kii pariksha paas kii
 The entire fraud started in 2013
 jab ganesh ne samastipur ke lakshminia main sanjay gandhi hai skool main nauveen kaksha main admician liya tha
 But for two years he did not attend a single class
 shikshakon ne bataaya ki jab is baar intermediat kii pariksha main ganesh kumaar ne arts main top karne kii jaankaree ai to shikshakon ko yakeen nahin hua
 The teachers said that out of the students who were admitted here, most of them were between 25 and 40 years old
 apane farjivade ko chupaane ke lieramkumar choudhary or unki patni devkumariskool main kisi bhi prakaar ke dastavej nahin rakhte the

 uttar pradesh main congress ke nae adhyaksh ke naam ko lekar party adhyaksh rahul gandhi or mahasachiv prabharee priyanka gandhi ke bich sahmati nahin ban paa rahi he
 This is the reason why despite being disliked by 80 percent of the workers of UP Congress, Raj Babbar remains the state president
 congress kaaryakarta chaahate hai ki soobe main party kii kaman aise shaks ko saunpi jaae jo pradesh ke gaanv se lekar block or jile tak ke jamini kaaryakartaaon se waakif ho tathaa jaateey or raajnneetik sameekaran main bhi feet baithta ho
 The party high command has sent Priyanka Gandhi and Jyotiraditya Scindia in charge in UP to revive the Congress which has been on ventilator for the last three decades
 donon netaaon ne soobe ke siyaasi mizaaj or sanghathan kii nabj ko samajhane ke liye pichley dinon chaar din lakhanu main rukkar ek-ek loksabhaa seat ke party kaaryakarta se baatcheet kii
 If sources are to be believed, in meeting and talking to Priyanka and Jyotiraditya, 80 percent of Congress workers and leaders expressed their opinion in favor of replacing state president Raj Babbar
 in kaaryakartaaon kaa kahana tha ki raaj babbar behatar chunaav prachaarak or bheed jutau netaa ho sakate hai, lekin soobe ke sanghathan ke mukhiya ke taur par ve sakasham vyakti nahin hai
 After this it was decided that the command of the party in the state should be handed over to the leader of a Brahmin community
 brahman pradesh adhyaksh banane par sabhi sahamat the
 If sources are to be believed, Congress President Rahul Gandhi as the young face suggested the names of Jitin Prasad and Laliteshpati Tripathi to make him the state president
 jabaki priyanka gandhi ne pramod tiwari ko banane ke paksh main apni baat rakhi
 Priyanka Gandhi argued that Pramod Tiwari would be the best in terms of the entire state
 jabaki jitin prasad or lalitesh treepathi abhi puure soobe ke liye feet nahin baithte hai, unka janaadhar mahaj ek simit kshetra tak he
 Apart from this, Priyanka also said that Pramod Tiwari also has a better relationship with SP-BSP
 aise main sapa-basapa ke saath gathbandhan main bhi wo ahm bhoomika adaa kar sakate hai
 However, Congress President Rahul Gandhi does not agree on the name of Pramod Tiwari
 isiilie kaaryakartaaon ke feedback ke baavjood rahul raaj babbar kii jagah duusare ko adhyaksh nahin bana sake hai
 Due to this, Raj Babbar's state president's chair still remains intact

 Giving details of the incident mentioned in the book 'half Lion: How PV Narasimha Rao Transformed India' written on former Prime Minister Rao, the Finance Minister said, 'when Rao was the Law Minister of Andhra Pradesh, his first decision was that all private colleges should Should be stopped and only the government should run the college
 ' unhone kaha, 'lekin jab vah pradhanmantri ban gaye to unhen pataa chalaa ki unke khajaane main koi videshi bhandar nahin bachaa he or desh diwaliyapan kii ore bad rahaa he

 Senior advocate Kamini Jaiswal, however, questioned the cbi's inquiry, asking why Indrani Mukherjee's statement was taken so late
 saaf he, sawaal karti chidambaram ke vakil ke daavon ko lekar bhi uth rahe hai or sibiai kii jaanch par bhi
 Now it has to be seen to what extent both the parties are able to prove their claims in the court in this case
 himachal pradesh ke kotkhai kii gudiya gangrape murder cese main sibiai ne hoicourt main states report daakhil kar diya
 Along with filing the report in a closed envelope, the CBI has sought some more time to investigate the matter

 On the other hand, this matter has also reached the President
 gudiya gangrape or murder cese raashtrapati ke paas pahunch gaya he
 Gudiya Nyaya Manch, made to get justice for Kotkhai student, has put online petition in the name of the President
 justise for gudiya naamak yachika main police jaanch par gambhir sawaal uthaae gaye hai
 It is alleged that the police has continuously tried to save the real culprits

 a worker has also been murdered in custody
 nyaay manch ne esaiti samet pradesh police pramukh ko barkhaast karne kii bhi maang uthaai he
 CBI does not find the police story to be true

 ' Today, on Premchand's death anniversary, we are presenting an excerpt from his novel Nirmala
 yah ansh upanyaas ke us mode kaa he jab nirmala apni sakhi sudhaa ko bataati he ki kaise paise or dahej na de paane ke chalate uskaa ek rishta tut gaya tha
 Sudha realizes that the boy is none other than her husband, who refused to marry Nirmala in the greed of money
 yah vaaki ankhen khol dene vaala chithran premchand ne kiya he
 After Nirmala leaves, Sudha talks to her husband in sharp words
 donon ke samvaad se dahej or dahej lobhiyon kii choti soch ko pesh karne ke saath hi dahej na de paane ke kaaran jivan bhar pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karne kii manodasha kaa bhi chithran bahut hi vaastavik he
 Here is an excerpt from the Nirmala novel in which Nirmala is telling Sudha how the family of a boy broke up because they had no money to give
 or uske baad sudhaa kii doctor sinha kii baatcheet
 
 
 From Nirmala: pesh he nirmala upanyaas kaa vah ansh jisamen nirmala sudhaa ko bataa rahi he ki kaise ek ladke ke parivaar waalon ne rishta isliye tod diya tha, kyonki unke paas dene ko dhan nahin tha
 And after that Sudha talks to Dr
 Sinha
 
 
 nirmala se : From Nirmala: nirmala : aathvaan maheenaa biit rahaa he
 This worry kills me even more
 maine to iske liye ishchar se kabhi prarthana na kii thi
 Why did this problem not penetrate my head? i am very unfortunate, sister, father died a month before marriage
 unke marate hi mere sir sanichar savaar hue
 Where earlier marriage negotiations were confirmed, those people turned their eyes
 bechaari amma ko harkar meraa vivaah yahaan karnaa padaa
 Now the younger sister is going to get married
 dekhen, uski naav kis ghat jaati he! Sudha: Where did the earlier marriage talks take place, why did they refuse? nirmala : yah to ve hi jaane
 If father is not there, then who would have given the bundle of gold? sudhaa : yah to neechata he
 Where did you live? nirmala : lakhanu ke
 Do not remember the name, there were some big officials of Excise
 sudhaa ne gambheer bhav se poocha : or unka ladkaa kya karata tha? Nirmala: Nothing, studied somewhere, but was very promising
 sudhaa ne sir nicha karke kaha: usne apane pita se kuch na kaha tha? vah to jawan tha, apane baap ko dabaa na saktaa tha? Nirmala: Now what shall i know, sister? Who doesn't love gold bundle? The priest who had taken the message from me, he had said that only the boy is refusing
 ladke kii maa alabatta devi thi
 He explained to both son and husband, but he did nothing
 sudhaa : main to us ladke ko paati, to khub aade haathon leti
 Nirmala: What was written in my destiny is done
 bechaari krishna par na jane kya beetegi? After Dr
 Nirmala left in the evening, when Dr
 Saheb came from outside, Sudha said, "why, what will you say to the man who, after fixing the marriage in one place, then confesses himself to another place?" doctor sinha ne stri kii ore kautuhal se dekhakar kaha : aisa nahin karnaa chahie or kya? Sudha: Why don't you say that it is grossly despicable, it is the cheapness of the first end! sinha : haa, yah kehane main bhi mujhe inkaar nahin
 Sudha: Whose crime is bigger? The groom's or the bride's father's? sinha kii samaj main abhi tak nahin aayaa ki sudhaa ke in prashnon kaa aashay kya he? vismay se bole, jaisi sthiti ho agar vah pita ke adheen ho, to pita kaa hi aparaadh samajho
 Sudha: Does the young man have no duty even when subjected? If he needs a new coat for himself, he makes him cry and wash even after opposing his father
 kya aise mahattav ke vishay main vah apni aawaaj pita ke kaanon tak nahin pahunchaa saktaa? yah kaho ki vah or uskaa pita donon apradhi hai, parantu var adhik
 The old man thinks that i will have to handle all the expenses, the more i can get from the Virgo side, the better
 magar var kaa dharm he ki yadi vah swaarth ke haathon bilkul bik nahin gaya he, to apane aatmbal kaa parichay de
 If he doesn't, i would say that he is greedy and also cowardly
 durbhagyavash aisa hi ek praani meraa pati he or meri samaj main nahin aata ki kin shabdon main uskaa tiraskaar karu! Sinha hesitantly said: He
 
 
 vah
 
 
 that
 
 
 duusari baat thi
 The reason for the transaction was not there, it was another matter
 kanya ke pita kaa dehant ho gaya tha
 Why do we get married in such a situation? It was also heard that there is an Aab in the girl
 vah bilkul duusari baat thi, magar tumse yah katha kisne kahi
 Sudha: Say whether she was Kanya Kani, or Kubri, or of Nine's stomach or corrupt
 itani kasar kyon chhod di? bhala sunuun to, us kanya main kya aib tha? Sinha: i did not see it, i came to hear that there is an ab
 sudhaa : sabase bada aib yahi tha ki uske pita kaa swargvaas ho gaya tha or vah koi lambii-chaudee rakam na de sakati thi
 Why do you blush by accepting so much? i will not bite your ears! If i say two or four concerns, then listen to this ear and blow it out of that ear
 zyada chin-chapad karu, to chadi se kaam le sakate ho
 The woman is well with her caste poles
 agar us kanya main koi aib tha, to main kahuungi, lakshmi bhi be aib nahin
 Your luck was lost, that's it! what else? You had to follow me
 sinha : tumse kisne kaha ki vah aisi thi waisi thi? jaise tumne kisi se sunakar maan liya
 Sudha: i did not listen
 apni ankhon dekha
 What should i say more, i had never seen such a beautiful woman
 sinha ne vyagr hokar poocha : kya vah yaheen kahin he? sach bataao, use kahaan dekha! kya tumhaare ghar ai thi? Sudha: Yes, she came to my house and has come many times, not once
 main bhi uske yahaan kai baar ja chuki hum, vakil sahab kii bivi vahi kanya he, jise aapane aibon ke kaaran tyaag diya
 Sinha: Truth! sudhaa : bilkul sach
 Today if he comes to know that you are the same great man, then maybe do not step into this house
 aisi sushila, ghar ke kaamon main aisi nipun or aisi param sundari stri is shahar main do hi chaar hongi
 You tell me main uske jaisi laundi banane ke yogya bhi nahin hum
 There is everything God has given in the house, but when the living being is not of peace, what will everyone else do? Blessed is her patience that the old lady is cutting her days of life with a lawyer
 maine to kab kaa jehar kha liya hota
 But the pain of the mind only manifests itself
 hansatii he, bolti he, gahane, kapade pahenti he, par royaan raaya karata he
 Sinha: You must have complained a lot to the lawyer? sudhaa : shikaayat kyon karegi? kya vah uske pati nahin hai? sansar me ab uske liye jo kuch hai, vakil sahab hai
 Whether he is old or sick, he is his master
 kulavanti striyaan pati kii ninda nahin karatin, yah kulataaon kaa kaam he
 She gets upset seeing his condition, but does not say anything with her mouth
 sinha : in vakil sahab ko kya suujhi thi, jo is umr main byaah karne chale? Sudha: If such men are not there, then who should cross the boat of poor Kanwaris? If you and your partner do not talk without a heavy bundle, then who will the poor house go to? You have done this great injustice and you have to atone for it
 ishwar uskaa suhaag amar kare, lekin vakil sahab ko kahin kuch ho gaya, to bechaari kaa jivan hi nasht ho jayega
 Today she cried a lot
 tum log sachmuch bade nirdayee ho
 i will marry my Sohan to a poor girl
 doctor sahab ne yah pichhlaa vaakya nahin suna
 He was deeply worried
 unke man main yah prashn uth-uthakar unhen vikal karne laga-kahin vakil sahab ko kuch ho gaya to? aaj unhen apane swaarth kaa bhanyakar swarup dikhaayi diya
 In fact, it was his crime
 agar unhone pita se jor dekar kaha hota ki main or kahin vivaah na karunga, to kya vah unki ichha ke virudv unka vivaah kar dete? Suddenly, Sudha said: Say, let me meet Nirmala tomorrow? Just look at your face
 vah kuch bolegi to nahin, par kadachit ek drushti se vah tumhaara itnaa tiraskaar kar degi, jise tum kabhi na bhul sakoge
 Say, see you tomorrow? i will introduce you very briefly sinha ne kaha : nahin sudhaa, tumhaare haath jodta hum, kahin aisa gajab na karnaa! nahin to sach kahata hum, ghar chhodkar bhaag jaaoongaa
 Sudha: Why are you so afraid of eating the fruit you have sown? Whosoever has dagger on his neck, just look at him suffering
 mere dada ji ne paanch hajaar diye na! abhi chote bhai ke vivaah man paanch-chha: hajaar or mil jaaenge
 Then there will be no other in your rich world
 gyaarah hajaar bahut hote hai
 Oh my God! eleven thousand! If you start picking up, it will take months if the boys start flying, then it will last for generations
 kahin se baat ho rahi he yaa nahin?tippaniyan With this gaiety, Doctor sailed so much that he could not lift his head
 unka sara vaak chaaturya gaayab ho gaya
 a small mouth came out, as if killed
 isi vakt kisi ne doctor sahab ko baahar se pukaaraan bechaare jaan lekar bhaage
 Today the introduction of how much fun a woman is skilled
 sudhaa : jahaan pehle vivaah kii baatcheet hui thi, un logon ne inkaar kyon kar diya? Nirmala: They only know this
 pitaaji na rahe, to sone kii gathree koun detaa? Sudha: It is despicable
 kahaan ke rahane vaale the? Nirmala: of Lucknow
 naam to yaad nahin, aabkaari ke koi bade afasar the
 Sudha asked gravely: And what did his boy do? nirmala : kuch nahin, kahin padhata tha, par bada honhaar tha
 Sudha nodded and said: Didn't he say anything to his father? He was young, could not suppress his father? nirmala : ab yah main kya jaanu bahin? sone kii gathree kise pyaari nahin hoti? jo pandit mere yahaan se sandesh lekar gaya tha, usne to kaha tha ki ladkaa hi inkaar kar rahaa he
 The boy's mother was Albatta Devi
 usne putr or pati donon hi ko samajhaayaa, par uski kuch na chali
 Sudha: If i had found that boy, i would have been very obstinate
 nirmala : mare bhagya main jo likhaa tha, vah ho chukaa
 Poor Krishna, don't know what will happen? sandhya samay nirmala ne jane ke baad jab doctor sahab baahar se aaye, to sudhaa ne kaha, kyon ji, tum us aadmi ko kya kahoge, jo ek jagah vivaah thik kar lene baad phir lobhavash kisi duusari jagah baat pakki kar letaa he? Doctor Sinha looking at the woman curiously and said: What should not be done? sudhaa : yah kyon nahin kehete ki ye ghor neechata he, pehle sire kaa kaminaapan he! Sinha: Yes, i do not refuse to say that either
 sudhaa : kiskaa aparaadh bada he? var kaa yaa var ke pita kaa? Sinha has not yet understood what is the meaning of these questions of Sudha
 He said with astonishment, if he is under the father's position, then consider the crime of the father
 sudhaa : adheen hone par bhi kya jawan aadmi kaa apana koi karttavya nahin he? agar use apane liye naye kot kii zarurat ho, to vah pita ke virodh karne par bhi use ro-dhokar banavaa letaa he
 Can he not bring his voice to the ears of the father about such importance? Say that both he and his father are criminals, but the groom is more
 boodha aadmi sochataa he mujhe to sara kharch sanbhaalanaa padegaa, kanya paksh se jitna anth sakuun, utana hi acha
 But the groom's religion is that if he is not sold at the hands of selfishness, then show your self-confidence
 agar vah aisa nahin karata, to main kahuungi ki vah lobhi he or kaayar bhi
 Unfortunately my husband is one such creature and i do not understand in what words to despise him! sinha ne hichkichaate hue kaha : vah
 
 
 that
 
 
 vah
 
 
 The second thing was
 len-dein kaa kaaran nahin tha, bilkul duusari baat thi
 Kanya's father died
 aisi dasha main ham log shaadi kyon karte? yah bhi sunne main aayaa tha ki kanya main koi aib he
 That was another matter, but who told you this story
 sudhaa: kah do ki vah kanya kani thi, yaa kubadi thi yaa nine ke pet kii thi yaa bhrashta thi
 Why gave up so much effort? Well, what was there in that girl? sinha : maine dekha to tha nahin, sunne main aayaa tha ki usamen koi aib he
 Sudha: The biggest ab was that her father had died and she could not give any big money
 itnaa sweekaar karne se kyon jhenpate ho? main kuch tumhaare kaan to kaat na luungi! agar do-chaar fikarey kahuun, to is kaan se sunakar us kaan se uda dena
 If you chirp more, you can use a stick
 aurat jaat danda hi se thik rahati he
 If there was an ab in that girl, then i would say, Lakshmi is also not an ab
 tumhaari kismat khoti thi, bas! or kya? tumhen to mere paale padana tha
 Sinha: Who told you she was like that? Like you agreed to hear from someone
 sudhaa : maine sunakar nahin maan liya
 Looked at your eyes
 zyada bakhaan kya karu, maine aisi sundar stri kabhi nahin dekhi thi
 Sinha asked anxiously: Is he here somewhere? Tell the truth, where did you see him! Did you come to your house? sudhaa : haa, mere ghar main ai thi or ek baar nahin, kai baar aa chuki he
 i have also visited her several times, the lawyer's wife is the same girl whom you abandoned because of your fathers
 sinha : sach! Sudha: Very true
 aaj agar use maaloom ho jaae ki aap vahi mahapurush hai, to shaayad phir is ghar main kadam na rakhe
 There will be only two such four in this city, such a skilled, such an expert in household work and such a beautiful woman
 tum meraa bakhaan karte ho
 i am not even eligible to be a maid like her
 ghar main ishwar kaa diya hua sab kuch he, magar jab praani hi mail kaa nahin, to or sab rahakar kya karegaa? dhanya he uske dhairya ko ki us budde khoost vakil ke saath jivan ke din kaat rahi he
 When would i have eaten poison
 magar man kii vyathaa kehane se hi thode prakat hoti he
 Laughs, speaks, wears jewelry, dresses, but weeps
 sinha : vakil sahab kii khub shikaayat karti hogi? Sudha: Why would you complain? Isn't she her husband? Whatever is in the world for him now, he is a lawyer
 vah budde hon yaa rogi, par hai to uske swami hi
 Kulwanti women do not condemn the husband, it is the work of the kulatas
 vah unki dasha dekhakar kudhati hai, par munh se kuch nahin kahati
 Sinha: What did these lawyers think, who went on to marry at this age? sudhaa : aise aadmi na hon, to garib kanvaariyon kii naav koun paar lagaaye? tum or tumhaare saathi bina baari gathree liye baat nahin karte, to phir ye bechaari kiske ghar jaaen? tumne yah bada baari anyaay kiya he or tumhen iskaa praayshchit karnaa padegaa
 May God bless him, but if something happens to the lawyer, the poor person's life will be destroyed
 aaj to vah bahut roi thi
 You guys are really cruel
 main to apane sohan kaa vivaah kisi garib ladki se karuungi
 The doctor did not hear this last sentence
 vah ghor chintaa man pad gayi
 This question arose in his mind and began to bother him - if something happened to the lawyer? Today, he was shown as a selfish form of selfishness
 vastav main yah unheen kaa aparaadh tha
 If he had insisted on his father that i would not marry anywhere else, would he have married him against his wish? sahasaa sudhaa ne kaha: kaho to kal nirmala se tumhaari mulaakaat kara duun? vah bhi jaraa tumhaari surat dekh le
 She will not say anything, but perhaps with a view she will scorn you so much, which you will never forget
 bolon, kal mila duun? tumhaara bahut sankshipt parichay bhi kara duungi Sinha said: No, Sudha, i join your hands, do not be so amazing! Otherwise, tell the truth, i will leave home and run away
 sudhaa: jo kanta boyaa he, uskaa fal khate kyon itnaa darate ho? jisaki gardan par kataar chalaai he, jaraa use tadapate bhi to dekho
 My grandfather gave five thousand
 Right now, five-six thousand more will be found in the marriage of younger brother
 phir to tumhaare baraabar dhani sansar main kaai doosraa na hoga
 There are eleven thousand many
 baap re baap! gyaarah hajaar! uthaa-uthaakar rakhane lage, to maheenon lag jaaen agar ladke udaane lagen, to pidiyon tak chale
 Talking somewhere or not? Comments is parihaas se doctor sahab itnaa jhenpe ki sir tak na uthaa sake
 All his speech tact disappeared
 nanha sa munh nikal aayaa, maano maar pad gai ho
 At the same time, someone ran away from the doctor calling him a poor fellow
 stri kitni parihaas kushal hoti he, iskaa aaj parichay mil gaya
 Nirmala: They only know this

 Sudha asked gravely: And what did his boy do? nirmala : kuch nahin, kahin padhata tha, par bada honhaar tha
 Sudha nodded and said: Didn't he say anything to his father? He was young, could not suppress his father? nirmala : ab yah main kya jaanu bahin? sone kii gathree kise pyaari nahin hoti? jo pandit mere yahaan se sandesh lekar gaya tha, usne to kaha tha ki ladkaa hi inkaar kar rahaa he
 The boy's mother was Albatta Devi
 usne putr or pati donon hi ko samajhaayaa, par uski kuch na chali
 Sudha: If i had found that boy, i would have been very obstinate
 nirmala : mare bhagya main jo likhaa tha, vah ho chukaa
 Poor Krishna, don't know what will happen? sandhya samay nirmala ne jane ke baad jab doctor sahab baahar se aaye, to sudhaa ne kaha, kyon ji, tum us aadmi ko kya kahoge, jo ek jagah vivaah thik kar lene baad phir lobhavash kisi duusari jagah baat pakki kar letaa he? Doctor Sinha looking at the woman curiously and said: What should not be done? sudhaa : yah kyon nahin kehete ki ye ghor neechata he, pehle sire kaa kaminaapan he! Sinha: Yes, i do not refuse to say that either
 sudhaa : kiskaa aparaadh bada he? var kaa yaa var ke pita kaa? Sinha has not yet understood what is the meaning of these questions of Sudha
 He said with astonishment, if he is under the father's position, then consider the crime of the father
 sudhaa : adheen hone par bhi kya jawan aadmi kaa apana koi karttavya nahin he? agar use apane liye naye kot kii zarurat ho, to vah pita ke virodh karne par bhi use ro-dhokar banavaa letaa he
 Can he not bring his voice to the ears of the father about such importance? Say that both he and his father are criminals, but the groom is more
 boodha aadmi sochataa he mujhe to sara kharch sanbhaalanaa padegaa, kanya paksh se jitna anth sakuun, utana hi acha
 But the groom's religion is that if he is not sold at the hands of selfishness, then show your self-confidence
 agar vah aisa nahin karata, to main kahuungi ki vah lobhi he or kaayar bhi
 Unfortunately my husband is one such creature and i do not understand in what words to despise him! sinha ne hichkichaate hue kaha : vah

 The second thing was

 Kanya's father died
 aisi dasha main ham log shaadi kyon karte? yah bhi sunne main aayaa tha ki kanya main koi aib he
 That was another matter, but who told you this story
 sudhaa: kah do ki vah kanya kani thi, yaa kubadi thi yaa nine ke pet kii thi yaa bhrashta thi
 Why gave up so much effort? Well, what was there in that girl? sinha : maine dekha to tha nahin, sunne main aayaa tha ki usamen koi aib he
 Sudha: The biggest ab was that her father had died and she could not give any big money
 itnaa sweekaar karne se kyon jhenpate ho? main kuch tumhaare kaan to kaat na luungi! agar do-chaar fikarey kahuun, to is kaan se sunakar us kaan se uda dena
 If you chirp more, you can use a stick

 If there was an ab in that girl, then i would say, Lakshmi is also not an ab
 tumhaari kismat khoti thi, bas! or kya? tumhen to mere paale padana tha
 Sinha: Who told you she was like that? Like you agreed to hear from someone
 sudhaa : maine sunakar nahin maan liya
 Looked at your eyes
 zyada bakhaan kya karu, maine aisi sundar stri kabhi nahin dekhi thi
 Sinha asked anxiously: Is he here somewhere? Tell the truth, where did you see him! Did you come to your house? sudhaa : haa, mere ghar main ai thi or ek baar nahin, kai baar aa chuki he
 i have also visited her several times, the lawyer's wife is the same girl whom you abandoned because of your fathers
 sinha : sach! Sudha: Very true
 aaj agar use maaloom ho jaae ki aap vahi mahapurush hai, to shaayad phir is ghar main kadam na rakhe
 There will be only two such four in this city, such a skilled, such an expert in household work and such a beautiful woman
 tum meraa bakhaan karte ho
 i am not even eligible to be a maid like her
 ghar main ishwar kaa diya hua sab kuch he, magar jab praani hi mail kaa nahin, to or sab rahakar kya karegaa? dhanya he uske dhairya ko ki us budde khoost vakil ke saath jivan ke din kaat rahi he
 When would i have eaten poison

 Laughs, speaks, wears jewelry, dresses, but weeps
 sinha : vakil sahab kii khub shikaayat karti hogi? Sudha: Why would you complain? Isn't she her husband? Whatever is in the world for him now, he is a lawyer
 vah budde hon yaa rogi, par hai to uske swami hi
 Kulwanti women do not condemn the husband, it is the work of the kulatas
 vah unki dasha dekhakar kudhati hai, par munh se kuch nahin kahati
 Sinha: What did these lawyers think, who went on to marry at this age? sudhaa : aise aadmi na hon, to garib kanvaariyon kii naav koun paar lagaaye? tum or tumhaare saathi bina baari gathree liye baat nahin karte, to phir ye bechaari kiske ghar jaaen? tumne yah bada baari anyaay kiya he or tumhen iskaa praayshchit karnaa padegaa
 May God bless him, but if something happens to the lawyer, the poor person's life will be destroyed
 aaj to vah bahut roi thi
 You guys are really cruel
 main to apane sohan kaa vivaah kisi garib ladki se karuungi
 The doctor did not hear this last sentence
 vah ghor chintaa man pad gayi
 This question arose in his mind and began to bother him - if something happened to the lawyer? Today, he was shown as a selfish form of selfishness
 vastav main yah unheen kaa aparaadh tha
 If he had insisted on his father that i would not marry anywhere else, would he have married him against his wish? sahasaa sudhaa ne kaha: kaho to kal nirmala se tumhaari mulaakaat kara duun? vah bhi jaraa tumhaari surat dekh le
 She will not say anything, but perhaps with a view she will scorn you so much, which you will never forget
 bolon, kal mila duun? tumhaara bahut sankshipt parichay bhi kara duungi Sinha said: No, Sudha, i join your hands, do not be so amazing! Otherwise, tell the truth, i will leave home and run away
 sudhaa: jo kanta boyaa he, uskaa fal khate kyon itnaa darate ho? jisaki gardan par kataar chalaai he, jaraa use tadapate bhi to dekho

 Right now, five-six thousand more will be found in the marriage of younger brother

 There are eleven thousand many
 baap re baap! gyaarah hajaar! uthaa-uthaakar rakhane lage, to maheenon lag jaaen agar ladke udaane lagen, to pidiyon tak chale
 Talking somewhere or not? Comments is parihaas se doctor sahab itnaa jhenpe ki sir tak na uthaa sake
 All his speech tact disappeared
 nanha sa munh nikal aayaa, maano maar pad gai ho
 At the same time, someone ran away from the doctor calling him a poor fellow
 stri kitni parihaas kushal hoti he, iskaa aaj parichay mil gaya
 Nirmala: Nothing, studied somewhere, but was very promising
 sudhaa ne sir nicha karke kaha: usne apane pita se kuch na kaha tha? vah to jawan tha, apane baap ko dabaa na saktaa tha? Nirmala: Now what shall i know, sister? Who doesn't love gold bundle? The priest who had taken the message from me, he had said that only the boy is refusing
 ladke kii maa alabatta devi thi
 He explained to both son and husband, but he did nothing
 sudhaa : main to us ladke ko paati, to khub aade haathon leti
 Nirmala: What was written in my destiny is done
 bechaari krishna par na jane kya beetegi? After Dr
 Nirmala left in the evening, when Dr
 Saheb came from outside, Sudha said, "why, what will you say to the man who, after fixing the marriage in one place, then confesses himself to another place?" doctor sinha ne stri kii ore kautuhal se dekhakar kaha : aisa nahin karnaa chahie or kya? Sudha: Why don't you say that it is grossly despicable, it is the cheapness of the first end! sinha : haa, yah kehane main bhi mujhe inkaar nahin
 Sudha: Whose crime is bigger? The groom's or the bride's father's? sinha kii samaj main abhi tak nahin aayaa ki sudhaa ke in prashnon kaa aashay kya he? vismay se bole, jaisi sthiti ho agar vah pita ke adheen ho, to pita kaa hi aparaadh samajho
 Sudha: Does the young man have no duty even when subjected? If he needs a new coat for himself, he makes him cry and wash even after opposing his father
 kya aise mahattav ke vishay main vah apni aawaaj pita ke kaanon tak nahin pahunchaa saktaa? yah kaho ki vah or uskaa pita donon apradhi hai, parantu var adhik
 The old man thinks that i will have to handle all the expenses, the more i can get from the Virgo side, the better
 magar var kaa dharm he ki yadi vah swaarth ke haathon bilkul bik nahin gaya he, to apane aatmbal kaa parichay de
 If he doesn't, i would say that he is greedy and also cowardly
 durbhagyavash aisa hi ek praani meraa pati he or meri samaj main nahin aata ki kin shabdon main uskaa tiraskaar karu! Sinha hesitantly said: He

 duusari baat thi
 The reason for the transaction was not there, it was another matter
 kanya ke pita kaa dehant ho gaya tha
 Why do we get married in such a situation? It was also heard that there is an Aab in the girl
 vah bilkul duusari baat thi, magar tumse yah katha kisne kahi
 Sudha: Say whether she was Kanya Kani, or Kubri, or of Nine's stomach or corrupt
 itani kasar kyon chhod di? bhala sunuun to, us kanya main kya aib tha? Sinha: i did not see it, i came to hear that there is an ab
 sudhaa : sabase bada aib yahi tha ki uske pita kaa swargvaas ho gaya tha or vah koi lambii-chaudee rakam na de sakati thi
 Why do you blush by accepting so much? i will not bite your ears! If i say two or four concerns, then listen to this ear and blow it out of that ear
 zyada chin-chapad karu, to chadi se kaam le sakate ho
 The woman is well with her caste poles
 agar us kanya main koi aib tha, to main kahuungi, lakshmi bhi be aib nahin
 Your luck was lost, that's it! what else? You had to follow me
 sinha : tumse kisne kaha ki vah aisi thi waisi thi? jaise tumne kisi se sunakar maan liya
 Sudha: i did not listen
 apni ankhon dekha
 What should i say more, i had never seen such a beautiful woman
 sinha ne vyagr hokar poocha : kya vah yaheen kahin he? sach bataao, use kahaan dekha! kya tumhaare ghar ai thi? Sudha: Yes, she came to my house and has come many times, not once
 main bhi uske yahaan kai baar ja chuki hum, vakil sahab kii bivi vahi kanya he, jise aapane aibon ke kaaran tyaag diya
 Sinha: Truth! sudhaa : bilkul sach
 Today if he comes to know that you are the same great man, then maybe do not step into this house
 aisi sushila, ghar ke kaamon main aisi nipun or aisi param sundari stri is shahar main do hi chaar hongi
 You tell me main uske jaisi laundi banane ke yogya bhi nahin hum
 There is everything God has given in the house, but when the living being is not of peace, what will everyone else do? Blessed is her patience that the old lady is cutting her days of life with a lawyer
 maine to kab kaa jehar kha liya hota
 But the pain of the mind only manifests itself
 hansatii he, bolti he, gahane, kapade pahenti he, par royaan raaya karata he
 Sinha: You must have complained a lot to the lawyer? sudhaa : shikaayat kyon karegi? kya vah uske pati nahin hai? sansar me ab uske liye jo kuch hai, vakil sahab hai
 Whether he is old or sick, he is his master
 kulavanti striyaan pati kii ninda nahin karatin, yah kulataaon kaa kaam he
 She gets upset seeing his condition, but does not say anything with her mouth
 sinha : in vakil sahab ko kya suujhi thi, jo is umr main byaah karne chale? Sudha: If such men are not there, then who should cross the boat of poor Kanwaris? If you and your partner do not talk without a heavy bundle, then who will the poor house go to? You have done this great injustice and you have to atone for it
 ishwar uskaa suhaag amar kare, lekin vakil sahab ko kahin kuch ho gaya, to bechaari kaa jivan hi nasht ho jayega
 Today she cried a lot
 tum log sachmuch bade nirdayee ho
 i will marry my Sohan to a poor girl
 doctor sahab ne yah pichhlaa vaakya nahin suna
 He was deeply worried
 unke man main yah prashn uth-uthakar unhen vikal karne laga-kahin vakil sahab ko kuch ho gaya to? aaj unhen apane swaarth kaa bhanyakar swarup dikhaayi diya
 In fact, it was his crime
 agar unhone pita se jor dekar kaha hota ki main or kahin vivaah na karunga, to kya vah unki ichha ke virudv unka vivaah kar dete? Suddenly, Sudha said: Say, let me meet Nirmala tomorrow? Just look at your face
 vah kuch bolegi to nahin, par kadachit ek drushti se vah tumhaara itnaa tiraskaar kar degi, jise tum kabhi na bhul sakoge
 Say, see you tomorrow? i will introduce you very briefly sinha ne kaha : nahin sudhaa, tumhaare haath jodta hum, kahin aisa gajab na karnaa! nahin to sach kahata hum, ghar chhodkar bhaag jaaoongaa
 Sudha: Why are you so afraid of eating the fruit you have sown? Whosoever has dagger on his neck, just look at him suffering
 mere dada ji ne paanch hajaar diye na! abhi chote bhai ke vivaah man paanch-chha: hajaar or mil jaaenge
 Then there will be no other in your rich world
 gyaarah hajaar bahut hote hai
 Oh my God! eleven thousand! If you start picking up, it will take months if the boys start flying, then it will last for generations
 kahin se baat ho rahi he yaa nahin?tippaniyan With this gaiety, Doctor sailed so much that he could not lift his head

 a small mouth came out, as if killed

 Today the introduction of how much fun a woman is skilled

 isi vakt kisi ne doctor sahab ko baahar se pukaaraan bechaare jaan lekar bhaage
 Today the introduction of how much fun a woman is skilled
 nirmala : ab yah main kya jaanu bahin? sone kii gathree kise pyaari nahin hoti? jo pandit mere yahaan se sandesh lekar gaya tha, usne to kaha tha ki ladkaa hi inkaar kar rahaa he
 The boy's mother was Albatta Devi
 usne putr or pati donon hi ko samajhaayaa, par uski kuch na chali
 Sudha: If i had found that boy, i would have been very obstinate
 nirmala : mare bhagya main jo likhaa tha, vah ho chukaa
 Poor Krishna, don't know what will happen? sandhya samay nirmala ne jane ke baad jab doctor sahab baahar se aaye, to sudhaa ne kaha, kyon ji, tum us aadmi ko kya kahoge, jo ek jagah vivaah thik kar lene baad phir lobhavash kisi duusari jagah baat pakki kar letaa he? Doctor Sinha looking at the woman curiously and said: What should not be done? sudhaa : yah kyon nahin kehete ki ye ghor neechata he, pehle sire kaa kaminaapan he! Sinha: Yes, i do not refuse to say that either
 sudhaa : kiskaa aparaadh bada he? var kaa yaa var ke pita kaa? Sinha has not yet understood what is the meaning of these questions of Sudha
 He said with astonishment, if he is under the father's position, then consider the crime of the father
 sudhaa : adheen hone par bhi kya jawan aadmi kaa apana koi karttavya nahin he? agar use apane liye naye kot kii zarurat ho, to vah pita ke virodh karne par bhi use ro-dhokar banavaa letaa he
 Can he not bring his voice to the ears of the father about such importance? Say that both he and his father are criminals, but the groom is more
 boodha aadmi sochataa he mujhe to sara kharch sanbhaalanaa padegaa, kanya paksh se jitna anth sakuun, utana hi acha
 But the groom's religion is that if he is not sold at the hands of selfishness, then show your self-confidence
 agar vah aisa nahin karata, to main kahuungi ki vah lobhi he or kaayar bhi
 Unfortunately my husband is one such creature and i do not understand in what words to despise him! sinha ne hichkichaate hue kaha : vah
 
 
 that
 
 
 vah
 
 
 The second thing was
 len-dein kaa kaaran nahin tha, bilkul duusari baat thi
 Kanya's father died
 aisi dasha main ham log shaadi kyon karte? yah bhi sunne main aayaa tha ki kanya main koi aib he
 That was another matter, but who told you this story
 sudhaa: kah do ki vah kanya kani thi, yaa kubadi thi yaa nine ke pet kii thi yaa bhrashta thi
 Why gave up so much effort? Well, what was there in that girl? sinha : maine dekha to tha nahin, sunne main aayaa tha ki usamen koi aib he
 Sudha: The biggest ab was that her father had died and she could not give any big money
 itnaa sweekaar karne se kyon jhenpate ho? main kuch tumhaare kaan to kaat na luungi! agar do-chaar fikarey kahuun, to is kaan se sunakar us kaan se uda dena
 If you chirp more, you can use a stick
 aurat jaat danda hi se thik rahati he
 If there was an ab in that girl, then i would say, Lakshmi is also not an ab
 tumhaari kismat khoti thi, bas! or kya? tumhen to mere paale padana tha
 Sinha: Who told you she was like that? Like you agreed to hear from someone
 sudhaa : maine sunakar nahin maan liya
 Looked at your eyes
 zyada bakhaan kya karu, maine aisi sundar stri kabhi nahin dekhi thi
 Sinha asked anxiously: Is he here somewhere? Tell the truth, where did you see him! Did you come to your house? sudhaa : haa, mere ghar main ai thi or ek baar nahin, kai baar aa chuki he
 i have also visited her several times, the lawyer's wife is the same girl whom you abandoned because of your fathers
 sinha : sach! Sudha: Very true
 aaj agar use maaloom ho jaae ki aap vahi mahapurush hai, to shaayad phir is ghar main kadam na rakhe
 There will be only two such four in this city, such a skilled, such an expert in household work and such a beautiful woman
 tum meraa bakhaan karte ho
 i am not even eligible to be a maid like her
 ghar main ishwar kaa diya hua sab kuch he, magar jab praani hi mail kaa nahin, to or sab rahakar kya karegaa? dhanya he uske dhairya ko ki us budde khoost vakil ke saath jivan ke din kaat rahi he
 When would i have eaten poison
 magar man kii vyathaa kehane se hi thode prakat hoti he
 Laughs, speaks, wears jewelry, dresses, but weeps
 sinha : vakil sahab kii khub shikaayat karti hogi? Sudha: Why would you complain? Isn't she her husband? Whatever is in the world for him now, he is a lawyer
 vah budde hon yaa rogi, par hai to uske swami hi
 Kulwanti women do not condemn the husband, it is the work of the kulatas
 vah unki dasha dekhakar kudhati hai, par munh se kuch nahin kahati
 Sinha: What did these lawyers think, who went on to marry at this age? sudhaa : aise aadmi na hon, to garib kanvaariyon kii naav koun paar lagaaye? tum or tumhaare saathi bina baari gathree liye baat nahin karte, to phir ye bechaari kiske ghar jaaen? tumne yah bada baari anyaay kiya he or tumhen iskaa praayshchit karnaa padegaa
 May God bless him, but if something happens to the lawyer, the poor person's life will be destroyed
 aaj to vah bahut roi thi
 You guys are really cruel
 main to apane sohan kaa vivaah kisi garib ladki se karuungi
 The doctor did not hear this last sentence
 vah ghor chintaa man pad gayi
 This question arose in his mind and began to bother him - if something happened to the lawyer? Today, he was shown as a selfish form of selfishness
 vastav main yah unheen kaa aparaadh tha
 If he had insisted on his father that i would not marry anywhere else, would he have married him against his wish? sahasaa sudhaa ne kaha: kaho to kal nirmala se tumhaari mulaakaat kara duun? vah bhi jaraa tumhaari surat dekh le
 She will not say anything, but perhaps with a view she will scorn you so much, which you will never forget
 bolon, kal mila duun? tumhaara bahut sankshipt parichay bhi kara duungi Sinha said: No, Sudha, i join your hands, do not be so amazing! Otherwise, tell the truth, i will leave home and run away
 sudhaa: jo kanta boyaa he, uskaa fal khate kyon itnaa darate ho? jisaki gardan par kataar chalaai he, jaraa use tadapate bhi to dekho

 bechaari krishna par na jane kya beetegi? After Dr
 Nirmala left in the evening, when Dr
 Saheb came from outside, Sudha said, "why, what will you say to the man who, after fixing the marriage in one place, then confesses himself to another place?" doctor sinha ne stri kii ore kautuhal se dekhakar kaha : aisa nahin karnaa chahie or kya? Sudha: Why don't you say that it is grossly despicable, it is the cheapness of the first end! sinha : haa, yah kehane main bhi mujhe inkaar nahin
 Sudha: Whose crime is bigger? The groom's or the bride's father's? sinha kii samaj main abhi tak nahin aayaa ki sudhaa ke in prashnon kaa aashay kya he? vismay se bole, jaisi sthiti ho agar vah pita ke adheen ho, to pita kaa hi aparaadh samajho
 Sudha: Does the young man have no duty even when subjected? If he needs a new coat for himself, he makes him cry and wash even after opposing his father
 kya aise mahattav ke vishay main vah apni aawaaj pita ke kaanon tak nahin pahunchaa saktaa? yah kaho ki vah or uskaa pita donon apradhi hai, parantu var adhik
 The old man thinks that i will have to handle all the expenses, the more i can get from the Virgo side, the better
 magar var kaa dharm he ki yadi vah swaarth ke haathon bilkul bik nahin gaya he, to apane aatmbal kaa parichay de
 If he doesn't, i would say that he is greedy and also cowardly
 durbhagyavash aisa hi ek praani meraa pati he or meri samaj main nahin aata ki kin shabdon main uskaa tiraskaar karu! Sinha hesitantly said: He
 
 
 vah
 
 
 that
 
 
 duusari baat thi
 The reason for the transaction was not there, it was another matter
 kanya ke pita kaa dehant ho gaya tha
 Why do we get married in such a situation? It was also heard that there is an Aab in the girl
 vah bilkul duusari baat thi, magar tumse yah katha kisne kahi
 Sudha: Say whether she was Kanya Kani, or Kubri, or of Nine's stomach or corrupt
 itani kasar kyon chhod di? bhala sunuun to, us kanya main kya aib tha? Sinha: i did not see it, i came to hear that there is an ab
 sudhaa : sabase bada aib yahi tha ki uske pita kaa swargvaas ho gaya tha or vah koi lambii-chaudee rakam na de sakati thi
 Why do you blush by accepting so much? i will not bite your ears! If i say two or four concerns, then listen to this ear and blow it out of that ear
 zyada chin-chapad karu, to chadi se kaam le sakate ho
 The woman is well with her caste poles
 agar us kanya main koi aib tha, to main kahuungi, lakshmi bhi be aib nahin
 Your luck was lost, that's it! what else? You had to follow me
 sinha : tumse kisne kaha ki vah aisi thi waisi thi? jaise tumne kisi se sunakar maan liya
 Sudha: i did not listen
 apni ankhon dekha
 What should i say more, i had never seen such a beautiful woman
 sinha ne vyagr hokar poocha : kya vah yaheen kahin he? sach bataao, use kahaan dekha! kya tumhaare ghar ai thi? Sudha: Yes, she came to my house and has come many times, not once
 main bhi uske yahaan kai baar ja chuki hum, vakil sahab kii bivi vahi kanya he, jise aapane aibon ke kaaran tyaag diya
 Sinha: Truth! sudhaa : bilkul sach
 Today if he comes to know that you are the same great man, then maybe do not step into this house
 aisi sushila, ghar ke kaamon main aisi nipun or aisi param sundari stri is shahar main do hi chaar hongi
 You tell me main uske jaisi laundi banane ke yogya bhi nahin hum
 There is everything God has given in the house, but when the living being is not of peace, what will everyone else do? Blessed is her patience that the old lady is cutting her days of life with a lawyer
 maine to kab kaa jehar kha liya hota
 But the pain of the mind only manifests itself
 hansatii he, bolti he, gahane, kapade pahenti he, par royaan raaya karata he
 Sinha: You must have complained a lot to the lawyer? sudhaa : shikaayat kyon karegi? kya vah uske pati nahin hai? sansar me ab uske liye jo kuch hai, vakil sahab hai
 Whether he is old or sick, he is his master
 kulavanti striyaan pati kii ninda nahin karatin, yah kulataaon kaa kaam he
 She gets upset seeing his condition, but does not say anything with her mouth
 sinha : in vakil sahab ko kya suujhi thi, jo is umr main byaah karne chale? Sudha: If such men are not there, then who should cross the boat of poor Kanwaris? If you and your partner do not talk without a heavy bundle, then who will the poor house go to? You have done this great injustice and you have to atone for it
 ishwar uskaa suhaag amar kare, lekin vakil sahab ko kahin kuch ho gaya, to bechaari kaa jivan hi nasht ho jayega
 Today she cried a lot
 tum log sachmuch bade nirdayee ho
 i will marry my Sohan to a poor girl
 doctor sahab ne yah pichhlaa vaakya nahin suna
 He was deeply worried
 unke man main yah prashn uth-uthakar unhen vikal karne laga-kahin vakil sahab ko kuch ho gaya to? aaj unhen apane swaarth kaa bhanyakar swarup dikhaayi diya
 In fact, it was his crime
 agar unhone pita se jor dekar kaha hota ki main or kahin vivaah na karunga, to kya vah unki ichha ke virudv unka vivaah kar dete? Suddenly, Sudha said: Say, let me meet Nirmala tomorrow? Just look at your face
 vah kuch bolegi to nahin, par kadachit ek drushti se vah tumhaara itnaa tiraskaar kar degi, jise tum kabhi na bhul sakoge
 Say, see you tomorrow? i will introduce you very briefly sinha ne kaha : nahin sudhaa, tumhaare haath jodta hum, kahin aisa gajab na karnaa! nahin to sach kahata hum, ghar chhodkar bhaag jaaoongaa
 Sudha: Why are you so afraid of eating the fruit you have sown? Whosoever has dagger on his neck, just look at him suffering
 mere dada ji ne paanch hajaar diye na! abhi chote bhai ke vivaah man paanch-chha: hajaar or mil jaaenge
 Then there will be no other in your rich world
 gyaarah hajaar bahut hote hai
 Oh my God! eleven thousand! If you start picking up, it will take months if the boys start flying, then it will last for generations
 kahin se baat ho rahi he yaa nahin?tippaniyan With this gaiety, Doctor sailed so much that he could not lift his head
 unka sara vaak chaaturya gaayab ho gaya
 a small mouth came out, as if killed
 isi vakt kisi ne doctor sahab ko baahar se pukaaraan bechaare jaan lekar bhaage
 Today the introduction of how much fun a woman is skilled
 sandhya samay nirmala ne jane ke baad jab doctor sahab baahar se aaye, to sudhaa ne kaha, kyon ji, tum us aadmi ko kya kahoge, jo ek jagah vivaah thik kar lene baad phir lobhavash kisi duusari jagah baat pakki kar letaa he? Doctor Sinha looking at the woman curiously and said: What should not be done? sudhaa : yah kyon nahin kehete ki ye ghor neechata he, pehle sire kaa kaminaapan he! Sinha: Yes, i do not refuse to say that either
 sudhaa : kiskaa aparaadh bada he? var kaa yaa var ke pita kaa? Sinha has not yet understood what is the meaning of these questions of Sudha
 He said with astonishment, if he is under the father's position, then consider the crime of the father
 sudhaa : adheen hone par bhi kya jawan aadmi kaa apana koi karttavya nahin he? agar use apane liye naye kot kii zarurat ho, to vah pita ke virodh karne par bhi use ro-dhokar banavaa letaa he
 Can he not bring his voice to the ears of the father about such importance? Say that both he and his father are criminals, but the groom is more
 boodha aadmi sochataa he mujhe to sara kharch sanbhaalanaa padegaa, kanya paksh se jitna anth sakuun, utana hi acha
 But the groom's religion is that if he is not sold at the hands of selfishness, then show your self-confidence
 agar vah aisa nahin karata, to main kahuungi ki vah lobhi he or kaayar bhi
 Unfortunately my husband is one such creature and i do not understand in what words to despise him! sinha ne hichkichaate hue kaha : vah
 
 
 that
 
 
 vah
 
 
 The second thing was
 len-dein kaa kaaran nahin tha, bilkul duusari baat thi
 Kanya's father died
 aisi dasha main ham log shaadi kyon karte? yah bhi sunne main aayaa tha ki kanya main koi aib he
 That was another matter, but who told you this story
 sudhaa: kah do ki vah kanya kani thi, yaa kubadi thi yaa nine ke pet kii thi yaa bhrashta thi
 Why gave up so much effort? Well, what was there in that girl? sinha : maine dekha to tha nahin, sunne main aayaa tha ki usamen koi aib he
 Sudha: The biggest ab was that her father had died and she could not give any big money
 itnaa sweekaar karne se kyon jhenpate ho? main kuch tumhaare kaan to kaat na luungi! agar do-chaar fikarey kahuun, to is kaan se sunakar us kaan se uda dena
 If you chirp more, you can use a stick
 aurat jaat danda hi se thik rahati he
 If there was an ab in that girl, then i would say, Lakshmi is also not an ab
 tumhaari kismat khoti thi, bas! or kya? tumhen to mere paale padana tha
 Sinha: Who told you she was like that? Like you agreed to hear from someone
 sudhaa : maine sunakar nahin maan liya
 Looked at your eyes
 zyada bakhaan kya karu, maine aisi sundar stri kabhi nahin dekhi thi
 Sinha asked anxiously: Is he here somewhere? Tell the truth, where did you see him! Did you come to your house? sudhaa : haa, mere ghar main ai thi or ek baar nahin, kai baar aa chuki he
 i have also visited her several times, the lawyer's wife is the same girl whom you abandoned because of your fathers
 sinha : sach! Sudha: Very true
 aaj agar use maaloom ho jaae ki aap vahi mahapurush hai, to shaayad phir is ghar main kadam na rakhe
 There will be only two such four in this city, such a skilled, such an expert in household work and such a beautiful woman
 tum meraa bakhaan karte ho
 i am not even eligible to be a maid like her
 ghar main ishwar kaa diya hua sab kuch he, magar jab praani hi mail kaa nahin, to or sab rahakar kya karegaa? dhanya he uske dhairya ko ki us budde khoost vakil ke saath jivan ke din kaat rahi he
 When would i have eaten poison
 magar man kii vyathaa kehane se hi thode prakat hoti he
 Laughs, speaks, wears jewelry, dresses, but weeps
 sinha : vakil sahab kii khub shikaayat karti hogi? Sudha: Why would you complain? Isn't she her husband? Whatever is in the world for him now, he is a lawyer
 vah budde hon yaa rogi, par hai to uske swami hi
 Kulwanti women do not condemn the husband, it is the work of the kulatas
 vah unki dasha dekhakar kudhati hai, par munh se kuch nahin kahati
 Sinha: What did these lawyers think, who went on to marry at this age? sudhaa : aise aadmi na hon, to garib kanvaariyon kii naav koun paar lagaaye? tum or tumhaare saathi bina baari gathree liye baat nahin karte, to phir ye bechaari kiske ghar jaaen? tumne yah bada baari anyaay kiya he or tumhen iskaa praayshchit karnaa padegaa
 May God bless him, but if something happens to the lawyer, the poor person's life will be destroyed
 aaj to vah bahut roi thi
 You guys are really cruel
 main to apane sohan kaa vivaah kisi garib ladki se karuungi
 The doctor did not hear this last sentence
 vah ghor chintaa man pad gayi
 This question arose in his mind and began to bother him - if something happened to the lawyer? Today, he was shown as a selfish form of selfishness
 vastav main yah unheen kaa aparaadh tha
 If he had insisted on his father that i would not marry anywhere else, would he have married him against his wish? sahasaa sudhaa ne kaha: kaho to kal nirmala se tumhaari mulaakaat kara duun? vah bhi jaraa tumhaari surat dekh le
 She will not say anything, but perhaps with a view she will scorn you so much, which you will never forget
 bolon, kal mila duun? tumhaara bahut sankshipt parichay bhi kara duungi Sinha said: No, Sudha, i join your hands, do not be so amazing! Otherwise, tell the truth, i will leave home and run away
 sudhaa: jo kanta boyaa he, uskaa fal khate kyon itnaa darate ho? jisaki gardan par kataar chalaai he, jaraa use tadapate bhi to dekho
 My grandfather gave five thousand
 Right now, five-six thousand more will be found in the marriage of younger brother
 phir to tumhaare baraabar dhani sansar main kaai doosraa na hoga
 There are eleven thousand many
 baap re baap! gyaarah hajaar! uthaa-uthaakar rakhane lage, to maheenon lag jaaen agar ladke udaane lagen, to pidiyon tak chale
 Talking somewhere or not? Comments is parihaas se doctor sahab itnaa jhenpe ki sir tak na uthaa sake
 All his speech tact disappeared
 nanha sa munh nikal aayaa, maano maar pad gai ho
 At the same time, someone ran away from the doctor calling him a poor fellow
 stri kitni parihaas kushal hoti he, iskaa aaj parichay mil gaya
 Doctor Sinha looking at the woman curiously and said: What should not be done? sudhaa : yah kyon nahin kehete ki ye ghor neechata he, pehle sire kaa kaminaapan he! Sinha: Yes, i do not refuse to say that either

 There is everything God has given in the house, but when the living being is not of peace, what will everyone else do? Blessed is her patience that the old lady is cutting her days of life with a lawyer
 maine to kab kaa jehar kha liya hota
 But the pain of the mind only manifests itself
 hansatii he, bolti he, gahane, kapade pahenti he, par royaan raaya karata he
 Sinha: You must have complained a lot to the lawyer? sudhaa : shikaayat kyon karegi? kya vah uske pati nahin hai? sansar me ab uske liye jo kuch hai, vakil sahab hai
 Whether he is old or sick, he is his master
 kulavanti striyaan pati kii ninda nahin karatin, yah kulataaon kaa kaam he
 She gets upset seeing his condition, but does not say anything with her mouth
 sinha : in vakil sahab ko kya suujhi thi, jo is umr main byaah karne chale? Sudha: If such men are not there, then who should cross the boat of poor Kanwaris? If you and your partner do not talk without a heavy bundle, then who will the poor house go to? You have done this great injustice and you have to atone for it
 ishwar uskaa suhaag amar kare, lekin vakil sahab ko kahin kuch ho gaya, to bechaari kaa jivan hi nasht ho jayega
 Today she cried a lot
 tum log sachmuch bade nirdayee ho
 i will marry my Sohan to a poor girl
 doctor sahab ne yah pichhlaa vaakya nahin suna
 He was deeply worried
 unke man main yah prashn uth-uthakar unhen vikal karne laga-kahin vakil sahab ko kuch ho gaya to? aaj unhen apane swaarth kaa bhanyakar swarup dikhaayi diya
 In fact, it was his crime
 agar unhone pita se jor dekar kaha hota ki main or kahin vivaah na karunga, to kya vah unki ichha ke virudv unka vivaah kar dete? Suddenly, Sudha said: Say, let me meet Nirmala tomorrow? Just look at your face
 vah kuch bolegi to nahin, par kadachit ek drushti se vah tumhaara itnaa tiraskaar kar degi, jise tum kabhi na bhul sakoge
 Say, see you tomorrow? i will introduce you very briefly sinha ne kaha : nahin sudhaa, tumhaare haath jodta hum, kahin aisa gajab na karnaa! nahin to sach kahata hum, ghar chhodkar bhaag jaaoongaa
 Sudha: Why are you so afraid of eating the fruit you have sown? Whosoever has dagger on his neck, just look at him suffering
 mere dada ji ne paanch hajaar diye na! abhi chote bhai ke vivaah man paanch-chha: hajaar or mil jaaenge
 Then there will be no other in your rich world
 gyaarah hajaar bahut hote hai
 Oh my God! eleven thousand! If you start picking up, it will take months if the boys start flying, then it will last for generations
 kahin se baat ho rahi he yaa nahin?tippaniyan With this gaiety, Doctor sailed so much that he could not lift his head
 unka sara vaak chaaturya gaayab ho gaya
 a small mouth came out, as if killed
 isi vakt kisi ne doctor sahab ko baahar se pukaaraan bechaare jaan lekar bhaage
 Today the introduction of how much fun a woman is skilled
 sudhaa : kiskaa aparaadh bada he? var kaa yaa var ke pita kaa? Sinha has not yet understood what is the meaning of these questions of Sudha
 He said with astonishment, if he is under the father's position, then consider the crime of the father
 sudhaa : adheen hone par bhi kya jawan aadmi kaa apana koi karttavya nahin he? agar use apane liye naye kot kii zarurat ho, to vah pita ke virodh karne par bhi use ro-dhokar banavaa letaa he
 Can he not bring his voice to the ears of the father about such importance? Say that both he and his father are criminals, but the groom is more
 boodha aadmi sochataa he mujhe to sara kharch sanbhaalanaa padegaa, kanya paksh se jitna anth sakuun, utana hi acha
 But the groom's religion is that if he is not sold at the hands of selfishness, then show your self-confidence
 agar vah aisa nahin karata, to main kahuungi ki vah lobhi he or kaayar bhi
 Unfortunately my husband is one such creature and i do not understand in what words to despise him! sinha ne hichkichaate hue kaha : vah
 
 
 that
 
 
 vah
 
 
 The second thing was
 len-dein kaa kaaran nahin tha, bilkul duusari baat thi
 Kanya's father died
 aisi dasha main ham log shaadi kyon karte? yah bhi sunne main aayaa tha ki kanya main koi aib he
 That was another matter, but who told you this story
 sudhaa: kah do ki vah kanya kani thi, yaa kubadi thi yaa nine ke pet kii thi yaa bhrashta thi
 Why gave up so much effort? Well, what was there in that girl? sinha : maine dekha to tha nahin, sunne main aayaa tha ki usamen koi aib he
 Sudha: The biggest ab was that her father had died and she could not give any big money
 itnaa sweekaar karne se kyon jhenpate ho? main kuch tumhaare kaan to kaat na luungi! agar do-chaar fikarey kahuun, to is kaan se sunakar us kaan se uda dena
 If you chirp more, you can use a stick
 aurat jaat danda hi se thik rahati he
 If there was an ab in that girl, then i would say, Lakshmi is also not an ab
 tumhaari kismat khoti thi, bas! or kya? tumhen to mere paale padana tha
 Sinha: Who told you she was like that? Like you agreed to hear from someone
 sudhaa : maine sunakar nahin maan liya
 Looked at your eyes
 zyada bakhaan kya karu, maine aisi sundar stri kabhi nahin dekhi thi
 Sinha asked anxiously: Is he here somewhere? Tell the truth, where did you see him! Did you come to your house? sudhaa : haa, mere ghar main ai thi or ek baar nahin, kai baar aa chuki he
 i have also visited her several times, the lawyer's wife is the same girl whom you abandoned because of your fathers
 sinha : sach! Sudha: Very true
 aaj agar use maaloom ho jaae ki aap vahi mahapurush hai, to shaayad phir is ghar main kadam na rakhe
 There will be only two such four in this city, such a skilled, such an expert in household work and such a beautiful woman
 tum meraa bakhaan karte ho
 i am not even eligible to be a maid like her
 ghar main ishwar kaa diya hua sab kuch he, magar jab praani hi mail kaa nahin, to or sab rahakar kya karegaa? dhanya he uske dhairya ko ki us budde khoost vakil ke saath jivan ke din kaat rahi he
 When would i have eaten poison
 magar man kii vyathaa kehane se hi thode prakat hoti he
 Laughs, speaks, wears jewelry, dresses, but weeps
 sinha : vakil sahab kii khub shikaayat karti hogi? Sudha: Why would you complain? Isn't she her husband? Whatever is in the world for him now, he is a lawyer
 vah budde hon yaa rogi, par hai to uske swami hi
 Kulwanti women do not condemn the husband, it is the work of the kulatas
 vah unki dasha dekhakar kudhati hai, par munh se kuch nahin kahati
 Sinha: What did these lawyers think, who went on to marry at this age? sudhaa : aise aadmi na hon, to garib kanvaariyon kii naav koun paar lagaaye? tum or tumhaare saathi bina baari gathree liye baat nahin karte, to phir ye bechaari kiske ghar jaaen? tumne yah bada baari anyaay kiya he or tumhen iskaa praayshchit karnaa padegaa
 May God bless him, but if something happens to the lawyer, the poor person's life will be destroyed
 aaj to vah bahut roi thi
 You guys are really cruel
 main to apane sohan kaa vivaah kisi garib ladki se karuungi
 The doctor did not hear this last sentence
 vah ghor chintaa man pad gayi
 This question arose in his mind and began to bother him - if something happened to the lawyer? Today, he was shown as a selfish form of selfishness
 vastav main yah unheen kaa aparaadh tha
 If he had insisted on his father that i would not marry anywhere else, would he have married him against his wish? sahasaa sudhaa ne kaha: kaho to kal nirmala se tumhaari mulaakaat kara duun? vah bhi jaraa tumhaari surat dekh le
 She will not say anything, but perhaps with a view she will scorn you so much, which you will never forget
 bolon, kal mila duun? tumhaara bahut sankshipt parichay bhi kara duungi Sinha said: No, Sudha, i join your hands, do not be so amazing! Otherwise, tell the truth, i will leave home and run away
 sudhaa: jo kanta boyaa he, uskaa fal khate kyon itnaa darate ho? jisaki gardan par kataar chalaai he, jaraa use tadapate bhi to dekho
 My grandfather gave five thousand
 Right now, five-six thousand more will be found in the marriage of younger brother
 phir to tumhaare baraabar dhani sansar main kaai doosraa na hoga
 There are eleven thousand many
 baap re baap! gyaarah hajaar! uthaa-uthaakar rakhane lage, to maheenon lag jaaen agar ladke udaane lagen, to pidiyon tak chale
 Talking somewhere or not? Comments is parihaas se doctor sahab itnaa jhenpe ki sir tak na uthaa sake
 All his speech tact disappeared
 nanha sa munh nikal aayaa, maano maar pad gai ho
 At the same time, someone ran away from the doctor calling him a poor fellow
 stri kitni parihaas kushal hoti he, iskaa aaj parichay mil gaya
 Sinha has not yet understood what is the meaning of these questions of Sudha
 He said with astonishment, if he is under the father's position, then consider the crime of the father
 sudhaa : adheen hone par bhi kya jawan aadmi kaa apana koi karttavya nahin he? agar use apane liye naye kot kii zarurat ho, to vah pita ke virodh karne par bhi use ro-dhokar banavaa letaa he

 All his speech tact disappeared
 nanha sa munh nikal aayaa, maano maar pad gai ho
 At the same time, someone ran away from the doctor calling him a poor fellow
 stri kitni parihaas kushal hoti he, iskaa aaj parichay mil gaya
 Sudha: Does the young man have no duty even when subjected? If he needs a new coat for himself, he makes him cry and wash even after opposing his father
 kya aise mahattav ke vishay main vah apni aawaaj pita ke kaanon tak nahin pahunchaa saktaa? yah kaho ki vah or uskaa pita donon apradhi hai, parantu var adhik
 The old man thinks that i will have to handle all the expenses, the more i can get from the Virgo side, the better
 magar var kaa dharm he ki yadi vah swaarth ke haathon bilkul bik nahin gaya he, to apane aatmbal kaa parichay de
 If he doesn't, i would say that he is greedy and also cowardly
 durbhagyavash aisa hi ek praani meraa pati he or meri samaj main nahin aata ki kin shabdon main uskaa tiraskaar karu! Sinha hesitantly said: He
 
 
 vah
 
 
 that
 
 
 duusari baat thi
 The reason for the transaction was not there, it was another matter
 kanya ke pita kaa dehant ho gaya tha
 Why do we get married in such a situation? It was also heard that there is an Aab in the girl
 vah bilkul duusari baat thi, magar tumse yah katha kisne kahi
 Sudha: Say whether she was Kanya Kani, or Kubri, or of Nine's stomach or corrupt
 itani kasar kyon chhod di? bhala sunuun to, us kanya main kya aib tha? Sinha: i did not see it, i came to hear that there is an ab
 sudhaa : sabase bada aib yahi tha ki uske pita kaa swargvaas ho gaya tha or vah koi lambii-chaudee rakam na de sakati thi
 Why do you blush by accepting so much? i will not bite your ears! If i say two or four concerns, then listen to this ear and blow it out of that ear
 zyada chin-chapad karu, to chadi se kaam le sakate ho
 The woman is well with her caste poles
 agar us kanya main koi aib tha, to main kahuungi, lakshmi bhi be aib nahin
 Your luck was lost, that's it! what else? You had to follow me
 sinha : tumse kisne kaha ki vah aisi thi waisi thi? jaise tumne kisi se sunakar maan liya
 Sudha: i did not listen
 apni ankhon dekha
 What should i say more, i had never seen such a beautiful woman
 sinha ne vyagr hokar poocha : kya vah yaheen kahin he? sach bataao, use kahaan dekha! kya tumhaare ghar ai thi? Sudha: Yes, she came to my house and has come many times, not once
 main bhi uske yahaan kai baar ja chuki hum, vakil sahab kii bivi vahi kanya he, jise aapane aibon ke kaaran tyaag diya
 Sinha: Truth! sudhaa : bilkul sach
 Today if he comes to know that you are the same great man, then maybe do not step into this house
 aisi sushila, ghar ke kaamon main aisi nipun or aisi param sundari stri is shahar main do hi chaar hongi
 You tell me main uske jaisi laundi banane ke yogya bhi nahin hum
 There is everything God has given in the house, but when the living being is not of peace, what will everyone else do? Blessed is her patience that the old lady is cutting her days of life with a lawyer
 maine to kab kaa jehar kha liya hota
 But the pain of the mind only manifests itself
 hansatii he, bolti he, gahane, kapade pahenti he, par royaan raaya karata he
 Sinha: You must have complained a lot to the lawyer? sudhaa : shikaayat kyon karegi? kya vah uske pati nahin hai? sansar me ab uske liye jo kuch hai, vakil sahab hai
 Whether he is old or sick, he is his master
 kulavanti striyaan pati kii ninda nahin karatin, yah kulataaon kaa kaam he
 She gets upset seeing his condition, but does not say anything with her mouth
 sinha : in vakil sahab ko kya suujhi thi, jo is umr main byaah karne chale? Sudha: If such men are not there, then who should cross the boat of poor Kanwaris? If you and your partner do not talk without a heavy bundle, then who will the poor house go to? You have done this great injustice and you have to atone for it
 ishwar uskaa suhaag amar kare, lekin vakil sahab ko kahin kuch ho gaya, to bechaari kaa jivan hi nasht ho jayega
 Today she cried a lot
 tum log sachmuch bade nirdayee ho
 i will marry my Sohan to a poor girl
 doctor sahab ne yah pichhlaa vaakya nahin suna
 He was deeply worried
 unke man main yah prashn uth-uthakar unhen vikal karne laga-kahin vakil sahab ko kuch ho gaya to? aaj unhen apane swaarth kaa bhanyakar swarup dikhaayi diya
 In fact, it was his crime

 You guys are really cruel

 The doctor did not hear this last sentence

 This question arose in his mind and began to bother him - if something happened to the lawyer? Today, he was shown as a selfish form of selfishness
 vastav main yah unheen kaa aparaadh tha
 If he had insisted on his father that i would not marry anywhere else, would he have married him against his wish? sahasaa sudhaa ne kaha: kaho to kal nirmala se tumhaari mulaakaat kara duun? vah bhi jaraa tumhaari surat dekh le

 i will marry my Sohan to a poor girl
 doctor sahab ne yah pichhlaa vaakya nahin suna
 He was deeply worried
 unke man main yah prashn uth-uthakar unhen vikal karne laga-kahin vakil sahab ko kuch ho gaya to? aaj unhen apane swaarth kaa bhanyakar swarup dikhaayi diya
 In fact, it was his crime
 agar unhone pita se jor dekar kaha hota ki main or kahin vivaah na karunga, to kya vah unki ichha ke virudv unka vivaah kar dete? Suddenly, Sudha said: Say, let me meet Nirmala tomorrow? Just look at your face
 vah kuch bolegi to nahin, par kadachit ek drushti se vah tumhaara itnaa tiraskaar kar degi, jise tum kabhi na bhul sakoge
 Say, see you tomorrow? i will introduce you very briefly sinha ne kaha : nahin sudhaa, tumhaare haath jodta hum, kahin aisa gajab na karnaa! nahin to sach kahata hum, ghar chhodkar bhaag jaaoongaa
 Sudha: Why are you so afraid of eating the fruit you have sown? Whosoever has dagger on his neck, just look at him suffering
 mere dada ji ne paanch hajaar diye na! abhi chote bhai ke vivaah man paanch-chha: hajaar or mil jaaenge
 Then there will be no other in your rich world
 gyaarah hajaar bahut hote hai
 Oh my God! eleven thousand! If you start picking up, it will take months if the boys start flying, then it will last for generations
 kahin se baat ho rahi he yaa nahin?tippaniyan With this gaiety, Doctor sailed so much that he could not lift his head
 unka sara vaak chaaturya gaayab ho gaya
 a small mouth came out, as if killed
 isi vakt kisi ne doctor sahab ko baahar se pukaaraan bechaare jaan lekar bhaage
 Today the introduction of how much fun a woman is skilled
 sinha : maine dekha to tha nahin, sunne main aayaa tha ki usamen koi aib he
 Sudha: The biggest ab was that her father had died and she could not give any big money
 itnaa sweekaar karne se kyon jhenpate ho? main kuch tumhaare kaan to kaat na luungi! agar do-chaar fikarey kahuun, to is kaan se sunakar us kaan se uda dena
 If you chirp more, you can use a stick
 aurat jaat danda hi se thik rahati he
 If there was an ab in that girl, then i would say, Lakshmi is also not an ab
 tumhaari kismat khoti thi, bas! or kya? tumhen to mere paale padana tha
 Sinha: Who told you she was like that? Like you agreed to hear from someone
 sudhaa : maine sunakar nahin maan liya
 Looked at your eyes
 zyada bakhaan kya karu, maine aisi sundar stri kabhi nahin dekhi thi
 Sinha asked anxiously: Is he here somewhere? Tell the truth, where did you see him! Did you come to your house? sudhaa : haa, mere ghar main ai thi or ek baar nahin, kai baar aa chuki he
 i have also visited her several times, the lawyer's wife is the same girl whom you abandoned because of your fathers
 sinha : sach! Sudha: Very true
 aaj agar use maaloom ho jaae ki aap vahi mahapurush hai, to shaayad phir is ghar main kadam na rakhe
 There will be only two such four in this city, such a skilled, such an expert in household work and such a beautiful woman
 tum meraa bakhaan karte ho
 i am not even eligible to be a maid like her
 ghar main ishwar kaa diya hua sab kuch he, magar jab praani hi mail kaa nahin, to or sab rahakar kya karegaa? dhanya he uske dhairya ko ki us budde khoost vakil ke saath jivan ke din kaat rahi he
 When would i have eaten poison
 magar man kii vyathaa kehane se hi thode prakat hoti he
 Laughs, speaks, wears jewelry, dresses, but weeps
 sinha : vakil sahab kii khub shikaayat karti hogi? Sudha: Why would you complain? Isn't she her husband? Whatever is in the world for him now, he is a lawyer
 vah budde hon yaa rogi, par hai to uske swami hi
 Kulwanti women do not condemn the husband, it is the work of the kulatas
 vah unki dasha dekhakar kudhati hai, par munh se kuch nahin kahati
 Sinha: What did these lawyers think, who went on to marry at this age? sudhaa : aise aadmi na hon, to garib kanvaariyon kii naav koun paar lagaaye? tum or tumhaare saathi bina baari gathree liye baat nahin karte, to phir ye bechaari kiske ghar jaaen? tumne yah bada baari anyaay kiya he or tumhen iskaa praayshchit karnaa padegaa
 May God bless him, but if something happens to the lawyer, the poor person's life will be destroyed
 aaj to vah bahut roi thi
 You guys are really cruel
 main to apane sohan kaa vivaah kisi garib ladki se karuungi
 The doctor did not hear this last sentence
 vah ghor chintaa man pad gayi
 This question arose in his mind and began to bother him - if something happened to the lawyer? Today, he was shown as a selfish form of selfishness
 vastav main yah unheen kaa aparaadh tha
 If he had insisted on his father that i would not marry anywhere else, would he have married him against his wish? sahasaa sudhaa ne kaha: kaho to kal nirmala se tumhaari mulaakaat kara duun? vah bhi jaraa tumhaari surat dekh le
 She will not say anything, but perhaps with a view she will scorn you so much, which you will never forget
 bolon, kal mila duun? tumhaara bahut sankshipt parichay bhi kara duungi Sinha said: No, Sudha, i join your hands, do not be so amazing! Otherwise, tell the truth, i will leave home and run away
 sudhaa: jo kanta boyaa he, uskaa fal khate kyon itnaa darate ho? jisaki gardan par kataar chalaai he, jaraa use tadapate bhi to dekho
 My grandfather gave five thousand
 Right now, five-six thousand more will be found in the marriage of younger brother
 phir to tumhaare baraabar dhani sansar main kaai doosraa na hoga
 There are eleven thousand many
 baap re baap! gyaarah hajaar! uthaa-uthaakar rakhane lage, to maheenon lag jaaen agar ladke udaane lagen, to pidiyon tak chale
 Talking somewhere or not? Comments is parihaas se doctor sahab itnaa jhenpe ki sir tak na uthaa sake
 All his speech tact disappeared
 nanha sa munh nikal aayaa, maano maar pad gai ho
 At the same time, someone ran away from the doctor calling him a poor fellow
 stri kitni parihaas kushal hoti he, iskaa aaj parichay mil gaya
 Sudha: The biggest ab was that her father had died and she could not give any big money
 itnaa sweekaar karne se kyon jhenpate ho? main kuch tumhaare kaan to kaat na luungi! agar do-chaar fikarey kahuun, to is kaan se sunakar us kaan se uda dena

 Sudha: i did not listen
 apni ankhon dekha
 What should i say more, i had never seen such a beautiful woman
 sinha ne vyagr hokar poocha : kya vah yaheen kahin he? sach bataao, use kahaan dekha! kya tumhaare ghar ai thi? Sudha: Yes, she came to my house and has come many times, not once
 main bhi uske yahaan kai baar ja chuki hum, vakil sahab kii bivi vahi kanya he, jise aapane aibon ke kaaran tyaag diya
 Sinha: Truth! sudhaa : bilkul sach
 Today if he comes to know that you are the same great man, then maybe do not step into this house
 aisi sushila, ghar ke kaamon main aisi nipun or aisi param sundari stri is shahar main do hi chaar hongi
 You tell me main uske jaisi laundi banane ke yogya bhi nahin hum
 There is everything God has given in the house, but when the living being is not of peace, what will everyone else do? Blessed is her patience that the old lady is cutting her days of life with a lawyer
 maine to kab kaa jehar kha liya hota
 But the pain of the mind only manifests itself
 hansatii he, bolti he, gahane, kapade pahenti he, par royaan raaya karata he
 Sinha: You must have complained a lot to the lawyer? sudhaa : shikaayat kyon karegi? kya vah uske pati nahin hai? sansar me ab uske liye jo kuch hai, vakil sahab hai
 Whether he is old or sick, he is his master
 kulavanti striyaan pati kii ninda nahin karatin, yah kulataaon kaa kaam he
 She gets upset seeing his condition, but does not say anything with her mouth
 sinha : in vakil sahab ko kya suujhi thi, jo is umr main byaah karne chale? Sudha: If such men are not there, then who should cross the boat of poor Kanwaris? If you and your partner do not talk without a heavy bundle, then who will the poor house go to? You have done this great injustice and you have to atone for it
 ishwar uskaa suhaag amar kare, lekin vakil sahab ko kahin kuch ho gaya, to bechaari kaa jivan hi nasht ho jayega

 aisi sushila, ghar ke kaamon main aisi nipun or aisi param sundari stri is shahar main do hi chaar hongi
 You tell me main uske jaisi laundi banane ke yogya bhi nahin hum
 There is everything God has given in the house, but when the living being is not of peace, what will everyone else do? Blessed is her patience that the old lady is cutting her days of life with a lawyer
 maine to kab kaa jehar kha liya hota
 But the pain of the mind only manifests itself
 hansatii he, bolti he, gahane, kapade pahenti he, par royaan raaya karata he
 Sinha: You must have complained a lot to the lawyer? sudhaa : shikaayat kyon karegi? kya vah uske pati nahin hai? sansar me ab uske liye jo kuch hai, vakil sahab hai
 Whether he is old or sick, he is his master
 kulavanti striyaan pati kii ninda nahin karatin, yah kulataaon kaa kaam he
 She gets upset seeing his condition, but does not say anything with her mouth
 sinha : in vakil sahab ko kya suujhi thi, jo is umr main byaah karne chale? Sudha: If such men are not there, then who should cross the boat of poor Kanwaris? If you and your partner do not talk without a heavy bundle, then who will the poor house go to? You have done this great injustice and you have to atone for it
 ishwar uskaa suhaag amar kare, lekin vakil sahab ko kahin kuch ho gaya, to bechaari kaa jivan hi nasht ho jayega
 Today she cried a lot
 tum log sachmuch bade nirdayee ho
 i will marry my Sohan to a poor girl
 doctor sahab ne yah pichhlaa vaakya nahin suna
 He was deeply worried
 unke man main yah prashn uth-uthakar unhen vikal karne laga-kahin vakil sahab ko kuch ho gaya to? aaj unhen apane swaarth kaa bhanyakar swarup dikhaayi diya
 In fact, it was his crime
 agar unhone pita se jor dekar kaha hota ki main or kahin vivaah na karunga, to kya vah unki ichha ke virudv unka vivaah kar dete? Suddenly, Sudha said: Say, let me meet Nirmala tomorrow? Just look at your face
 vah kuch bolegi to nahin, par kadachit ek drushti se vah tumhaara itnaa tiraskaar kar degi, jise tum kabhi na bhul sakoge
 Say, see you tomorrow? i will introduce you very briefly sinha ne kaha : nahin sudhaa, tumhaare haath jodta hum, kahin aisa gajab na karnaa! nahin to sach kahata hum, ghar chhodkar bhaag jaaoongaa
 Sudha: Why are you so afraid of eating the fruit you have sown? Whosoever has dagger on his neck, just look at him suffering
 mere dada ji ne paanch hajaar diye na! abhi chote bhai ke vivaah man paanch-chha: hajaar or mil jaaenge
 Then there will be no other in your rich world
 gyaarah hajaar bahut hote hai
 Oh my God! eleven thousand! If you start picking up, it will take months if the boys start flying, then it will last for generations
 kahin se baat ho rahi he yaa nahin?tippaniyan With this gaiety, Doctor sailed so much that he could not lift his head
 unka sara vaak chaaturya gaayab ho gaya
 a small mouth came out, as if killed
 isi vakt kisi ne doctor sahab ko baahar se pukaaraan bechaare jaan lekar bhaage
 Today the introduction of how much fun a woman is skilled
 sinha : vakil sahab kii khub shikaayat karti hogi? Sudha: Why would you complain? Isn't she her husband? Whatever is in the world for him now, he is a lawyer
 vah budde hon yaa rogi, par hai to uske swami hi
 Kulwanti women do not condemn the husband, it is the work of the kulatas
 vah unki dasha dekhakar kudhati hai, par munh se kuch nahin kahati
 Sinha: What did these lawyers think, who went on to marry at this age? sudhaa : aise aadmi na hon, to garib kanvaariyon kii naav koun paar lagaaye? tum or tumhaare saathi bina baari gathree liye baat nahin karte, to phir ye bechaari kiske ghar jaaen? tumne yah bada baari anyaay kiya he or tumhen iskaa praayshchit karnaa padegaa
 May God bless him, but if something happens to the lawyer, the poor person's life will be destroyed
 aaj to vah bahut roi thi
 You guys are really cruel
 main to apane sohan kaa vivaah kisi garib ladki se karuungi
 The doctor did not hear this last sentence
 vah ghor chintaa man pad gayi
 This question arose in his mind and began to bother him - if something happened to the lawyer? Today, he was shown as a selfish form of selfishness
 vastav main yah unheen kaa aparaadh tha
 If he had insisted on his father that i would not marry anywhere else, would he have married him against his wish? sahasaa sudhaa ne kaha: kaho to kal nirmala se tumhaari mulaakaat kara duun? vah bhi jaraa tumhaari surat dekh le
 She will not say anything, but perhaps with a view she will scorn you so much, which you will never forget
 bolon, kal mila duun? tumhaara bahut sankshipt parichay bhi kara duungi Sinha said: No, Sudha, i join your hands, do not be so amazing! Otherwise, tell the truth, i will leave home and run away
 sudhaa: jo kanta boyaa he, uskaa fal khate kyon itnaa darate ho? jisaki gardan par kataar chalaai he, jaraa use tadapate bhi to dekho
 My grandfather gave five thousand
 Right now, five-six thousand more will be found in the marriage of younger brother
 phir to tumhaare baraabar dhani sansar main kaai doosraa na hoga
 There are eleven thousand many
 baap re baap! gyaarah hajaar! uthaa-uthaakar rakhane lage, to maheenon lag jaaen agar ladke udaane lagen, to pidiyon tak chale
 Talking somewhere or not? Comments is parihaas se doctor sahab itnaa jhenpe ki sir tak na uthaa sake
 All his speech tact disappeared
 nanha sa munh nikal aayaa, maano maar pad gai ho
 At the same time, someone ran away from the doctor calling him a poor fellow
 stri kitni parihaas kushal hoti he, iskaa aaj parichay mil gaya

 har saal barish main dilli kii sadaken dariyaa ban jaati hai or phir shuru hota he ek-duusare par aarope lagane kaa silsilaa
 But will Delhi be submerged in water this year or will it take some lessons from previous years

 Sometimes the strike of the funds and sometimes the strike of the cleaning workers, in such a situation, we visited different areas of East Delhi and tried to know, whether the drains are being cleaned or not
 sabase pehle ham khudi ram bose maarg pahunche
 Here, along the road, the water of the colonies of the area comes through small drains, but due to encroachment over the drain here, Segad has not been released properly, which can become a cause of trouble in the rain
 iske alaava jo gaad nikali bhi he use sadak par hi chhod diya gaya he jo barish main waapas bahakar naale main hi chali jaayegi
 The silt of the PWD drains was removed near the bus base Anand Vihar and the drain water was flowing rapidly which meant that there was no obstruction in the drain either forward or backward, this drain going forward, irrigation and flooding Falls into the drain of the department
 dipti meyar ne liya jayjapandav nagar pi block main emsidi ke naale kii safai kaa kaam jari he

 unhone bataaya ki is baar peedbludi adhikari naalon kii safai main emsidi kaa haath banta rahe hai

 lalu yadav kii suraksha kam kiye jane ke baad unke bete tej pratap yadav ne jis tarah se pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf aapattijanak bayaan diya use lekar bijepi netaaon main kaaphi gussa he
 Recently Lalu Yadav's security was reduced from z + category to z category and nsg's security was also taken from him
 uske baad tej pratap yadav ne modi ke khilaaf bolte hue kaha ki agar unke pita ko kuch hua to vah modi kii khaal khinchvaa denge
 Union Minister Giriraj Singh directly blamed Khilalu Yadav for this statement of Lalu's son
 unhone kaha ki loktantr main koi is tarah kii aparaadhik bhashaa kaa istemaal nahin kar saktaa
 Giriraj Singh said that Lalu Yadav is sometimes asking his son and sometimes his wife to use such language
 unhone kaha ki lalu prasad yadav satta se hatane ke baad buree tarah baukhala gaye hai
 He got so upset when the security decreased a little while he himself has scared people for 15 years
 giriraaj ne kaha ki jab tak bihar main inkaa raaj rahaa to bihar kii janata inase dari or bhaybheet rahi
 Making serious allegations on Giriraj Nailaloo Yadav said, i think Lalu Yadav can do anything against the Prime Minister
 giriraaj ne sawaal uthaaya ki aapkaa narendra modi se virodh ho saktaa he lekin desh ke pradhanmantri ke khilaaf is tarah kii bhashaa kaa istemaal karnaa lalu yadav ko mahangaa padegaa
 He said that now Lalu Yadav has gone from power, maybe the public can send him into exile forever
 giriraaj ne lalu ko chetavanee dete hue kaha ki unako desh se aurabihar kii janathase maafee maangi padegi
 He also said that Lalu Yadav is not only telling the family members to speak such a language but is also supporting it
 unhone yaad dilaayaa ki kabhi sonia gandhi ne modi ko maut kaa saudagar kaha tha or janata ne unhen sabak sikhaa diya
 Now Lalu Yadav has made such a mistake and he will also have to face the punishment
 gauratlab he ki jab tej pratap yadav se lalu kii suraksha ghataane ko lekar sawaal kiya gaya to tej pratap ne kaha 'ham logon kaa aae din kaaryakramon main aana-janaa hota he,laluji bhi kai kaaryakramon main hissaa lete hi rahete hai, aise main suraksha waapas lenaa hatya karaane kii sajeesh he, ham iskaa munhtod jawaab denge, narendra modi ji kii khaal udhadva denge'

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a special conversation with Aaj Tak on Friday
 intervyuu ke dauraan unhone kaha ki hindustan kii viraasat ko badnaam karne waalon ke khilaaf sadhvi pragna ek simbel he
 Pointing towards the Congress, he said that these people have done a lot of crime against me in Gujarat
 lekin desh kii janata hamaare saath rahi
 Taking a dig at the Congress, the Prime Minister said that he will defame the country which he has defamed by saying Hindu terror
 pradhanmantri modi ne bhopal se bhaajapa kii ummidavaar sadhvi pragna singh thakur lekar sawaal kaa bhi jawaab diya
 He said that these people went to court against Pragya
 court ne kaha ki wo chunaav lard sakati he or wo ek simbel he
 Thousands of years of India's heritage has been maligned by calling it Hindu terrorism

 On the question of demonetisation, PM Modi said that demonetisation was not done for the election, but after demonetisation, our opponents had contested the elections of UP and the people of UP slapped them so that they no longer talk about it
 unhone kaha ki 2014 main hedline banati thi mahangaai, ab mahangaai par charchaa hi nahin hoti
 The media also did not ask the opposition about inflation
 teen talaak ke mudde par pradhanmantri ne kaha ki ye chunaav se judaa mudda nahin he balki maanviya mudda he
 We are also raising our voice against dowry, it does not mean that we are against Hindus
 piem ne kaha ki modi ne sirf dusron ke liye jeene ke liye prayaas kiya he

 duusare dalon kaa bhi ghoshnaptr main kam hi yaqiin lagata he phir bhi ve jari karte hai isliye thodi taareef unki bhi kii jaani chahie
 In our country the brand of manifesto has been beaten
 lihaaza pichley kuch chunaavon se ghoshnaptr ko vijan dacument jaise baari bharkam naam se dobaaraa launch kiya ja rahaa he
 The Vision Document does not have a manifesto-like commitment

 In the context of Bihar elections, both BJP and Nitish Kumar have issued vision documents
 nitish kumaar ne apane naam se personal guarantee vaala saat sutri vijan jari kiya to bijepi ke vijan dacument main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii tasviir he
 In the vision document, the BJP has dealt a package of one lakh sixty five thousand crore in two to four lines
 package kaa vistaar se koi byora nahin he
 The BJP has lost a great opportunity to give credibility to its package
 vijan dacument pard kar pataa nahin chalata ki ek lakh pansth hazaar karod main se sab kharch hoga yaa usamen kiye gaye vaadon ke liye alag se bajet banegaa
 Nitish Kumar has told the budget for his seven-point vision document but it is not known from where the money will come
 drushti patr ke naam se har dal yahi prayaas rahata he ki media main kuch aise bindu zyada lokapriy ho jaaen jinase vot khinchaa ja sake
 Like giving scooties, laptops and saris
 vijan dacument main likhaa hua he ki har dalit mahadalit tole main ek rangeen tivi diya jayega lekin media ne chalaaya ki har dalit or mahadalit ko rangeen tivi milegaa
 BJP should tell how many such tolls are there in Bihar and how many TV sets will be installed
 chota tivi milegaa ki bada
 When the Indian National Lok Dal promised to give Scooty in Haryana, everyone made fun of it
 lagata he televijan dene ke liye vijan dacument banaaya gaya he
 Will governments distribute cars in the next election? How long our youth will leave permanent solution to the poor condition of government school college and run after scooty and laptop

 Devendra Sharma said that it has not been told that no government can ask Punjab National Bank or State Bank to give loans at zero percent
 yah sirf koparative bainkon ke liye hai jinka detail vijan dacument main nahin miltaa
 That is why the vision document should be seriously debated so that the pressure on political parties to become serious increases

 In the name of vision paper, every party is trying to make some such points in the media more popular by which votes can be drawn
 jaise skuti, laptop or sari-dhoti dena
 It is written in the vision document that a color TV will be given in every Dalit Mahadalit hamlet but the media went on to say that every Dalit and Mahadalit will get color TV
 bijepi ko bataanaa chahie ki bihar main aise tolon kii sankhya kitni he or kitne tivi set lagenge
 Small TV will get that big

 The idea of a separate agricultural budget is good for the farmers, but why was this work not done at the country level? The BJP government implemented it in Karnataka, but did it improve the farming conditions? In the last few months, there have been reports of farmer suicides from Karnataka
 gujarat maharashtra or andhra pradesh main bhi aatmahatya kii ghatnaayen badi hai
 Why are farmers committing suicide in Punjab where there is an irrigation network? The need is to forgive the loans of those farmers where BJP is ruling but the concern is about the news of farmer suicides that started in Bihar

 The idea of a separate agricultural budget is good for the farmers, but why was this work not done at the country level? The BJP government implemented it in Karnataka, but did it improve the farming conditions? In the last few months, there have been reports of farmer suicides from Karnataka

 Why are farmers committing suicide in Punjab where there is an irrigation network? The need is to forgive the loans of those farmers where BJP is ruling but the concern is about the news of farmer suicides that started in Bihar
 kya isliye ki vahaan chunaav he?tippaniyan Economist Devendra Sharma said that the government is waiving loan of several thousand crores in the name of promoting the industry, but farmers are being told that the loan will be given on zero percent at the time of repayment

 kendriya cabinet ne ekasathatin talakako dandaneey aparaadh banane ke liye adhyadesh ko manjuuri de di he, jiskaa congress samet duusare vipakshi dal virodh kar rahe hai
 All India Majlis-e Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) MP Asaduddinovaisai has criticized the Modi government for bringing an ordinance against triple talaq
 ovaisi ne kaha he ki yah adhyadesh puri tarah muslim mahilaon ke khilaaf he
 Even Owaisi has termed the Modi government's decision against the fundamental right to equality
 modi cabinet dwaara laae gaye adhyadesh kaa virodh karne ke saath hi unhone ye bhi kaha ki islam ke tahat shaadi ek civil contract he or usamen aapraadhik praavdhaan lagu karnaa bilkul galat he
 Owaisi has demanded that instead of criminalizing the triple talaq law, the government should bring laws for 2
4 million married women who have left their husbands without divorcing them
 udhar, cabinet ke faisle kii jaankaree dete hue kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne bataaya ki supreme court kii ore se teen talaak kii kupratha par pabandi lagaae jane ke baad bhi yah jari he, jiske kaaran adhyadesh lagu karne kii aavashyaktaa padi
 She accused the Congress of not cooperating in passing the 'protection of Muslim Women Marriage Rights Bill' pending in Rajya Sabha due to vote bank politics
 ravishankar prasad ne teen talaak kii pratha ko 'barbar or amanviya' qaraar dete hue kaha ki kareeb 22 deshon ne teen talaak kaa niyaman kiya he
 However, gender justice was completely ignored in a secular country like India due to vote bank politics
 pichley kaaphi lambey samay se bhartiya hockey ke diggaj dhyanchand ko bharat ratna dene kii maang chal rahi he
 But now it seems that this demand can be fulfilled soon

 It is expected that this recommendation may be approved soon
 Sports minister@vijaygoelbjpwrites to@pmoindia, requesting # bharatratnafor hockey wizard # dhyanchand
 - Press Trust of India (@pti_news) June 7, 2017 Former veteran hockey players turned to Jantar Mantar on Sunday, demanding the award of Bharat Ratna to hockey magician Dhyanchand
 is dauraan dhyanchand ke bete ashok kumaar, 1975 main bharat ko khitaabi jeet dilaane vaale ajit paal singh ke alaava jafar ikbaal, dilip tirki yahaan jantar-mantar par is ummid ke saath jute ki modi sarkaar unki maang puri karegi
 Reiterating the long standing demand for the award of Bharat Ratna to hockey player Dhyan Chand from the stage of three Olympic Gold Medals, jantar-mantar, he was asked whether the government would award Bharat Ratna to that great player who scored more than 1000 goals in his sporting life
 jisaki aguai main bharat ne 1928, 1932 or 1936 main olympic swarna padak jite
 Repeatedly, the former players, who had gathered to demand the award of Bharat Ratna to hockey player Dhyanchand, expressed disappointment from the stage, saying that the first Bharat Ratna Dhyanchand should have got it but he did not get the right justice
 2014 main hockey khilaadiyon ne march nikaalkar tatkaaleen pradhanmantri se maang bhi kii thi
 After this, in 2011 82 mps appealed to the Ministry of Youth and Sports to give Bharat Ratna to Dhyanchand
 2016 main rajyasabha sadsy dilip turki ne bhi sansad main dhyanchand ko bharat ratna na dene ke sawaal ko uthaaya tha
 But till now the government has completely ignored this appeal
 padhein major dhyanchand ke bare main kuch khaas baaten
 
 
 1
 hockey ke jaadugar dhyanchand kaa janm 29 agast 1905 ko elahabaad ke rajput gharaane main hua
 Dhyanchand is considered equal to Pelé in football and Bradman in cricket
 2
 When he used to take the field to hockey, the ball would stick to his stick as if he was playing hockey with a magic stick
 3
 During a match in Holland, he was seen breaking his stick in the fear of being a magnet in hockey
 japan main ek match ke dauraan unki stick main gond lage hone kii baat bhi kahi gai
 No player has reached the record that Dhyanchand made in hockey
 4
 After Dhyanchand's early education, at the age of 16, he was admitted as an ordinary soldier
 jab 'first brahman regiment' main bhartee hue us samay tak unke man main hockey ke prati koi vishesh dilchaspee yaa ruchi nahin thi
 The credit for motivating Dhyanchand to play hockey is to Major Tiwari, a Subedar of the Regiment
 5
 Dhyanchand represented India in three Olympic Games and won the gold medal for the country three times
 bharat ne 1932 main 37 match main 338 gol kiye, jisamen 133 gol dhyanchand ne kiye the
 Before the Second World War, Dhyanchand gave India gold medals in hockey in three consecutive Olympics in 1928 (amsterdam), 1932 (los Angeles) and 1936 (berlin)
 vienna main dhyanchand kii chaar haath main chaar hockey stick liye ek murti lagi he

 1956 main unhen padam bhushan se sammanit kiya gaya
 His birthday has been declared as National Sports Day of India
 isi din khel main utkrisht pradarshan ke liye rashtriya puraskaar arjuna or dronacharya puraskaar pradaan kiye jate hai
 Dhyanchand was declared the player of the century by the Indian Olympic Association

 The survey further states that employers have to focus on their own branding in attracting and engaging talented employees in the current competitive business
 randstad india ke chairman paul vine di kekhaaf ne kaha, ‘ham yah dekhakar bahut khush hai ki niyokta branding par dhyaan dene vaali bhartiya companiyon kii sankhya main nirantar vruddhi ho rahi he

 In Bollywood, it is considered very important to strike a balance between films and characters, especially for actresses
 is industry main badi heroin vahi he jo bade filmkaaron or bade abhinaytaon ke saath kaam kare
 Also, in order to gain appreciation or show acting ability, also do some different films in between which the weight should be on his own shoulder, otherwise sometimes a different film gives a heroine a big success, but she succeeds for a long time
 Does not last
 isse pehle kii aisi kuch naakaami bataaun sabase pehle ye bataa duun ki deepika padukon, priyanka chopra, anoushka sharma yaa karina kapur ek taraf shahrukh salmaan, shahrukh, aamir, hrithik, akshay yaa ajay devgan ke saath masala filmein karti hai to duusari taraf santulan banaaye rakhane ke liye mericom, en ech10, piku yaa finding pheni jaisi alag tarah kii filmein bhi karti hai
 However, some actresses find female-oriented films that are completely different and better
 aisi film se abhinetri ekadam kamyaabi ke shikhar par jaati hai or 2 se 3 filmon ke baad wo waapas vaise hi neeche jaati hai
 Something similar happened with Vidya Balan
 haalanki vidya ne kuch filmein bade sitaron ke saath kin magar film 'no van kild jesica' kii safalata ke baad thoda alag rasta pakadaa
 After that, the role of Silk Smita in the film 'the Dirty Picture' gave Vidya a different status
 aisa shor machane laga kii vidya se badi koi abhinetri nahin
 This claim from the media and audience got a stronger ground when Vidya's next film Kahani was released
 tippaniyan The story gave Vidya both success and appreciation
 magar jaise hi 'ghanchakkar' flop hui, vidya achaanak baikfoot par aa gai kyonki ye bhi ek mahila pradhan film hi thi
 After that Vidya's film 'shaadi Ke Side Effect' flopped and after that 'bobby Detective' also did not work and this year the film 'hamari Adhuri Kahani' also failed
 haalanki vidya ne apni filmo main achche abhinay kiye magar shaayad santulan nahin banaaya commercial or masala filmon main
 And the result is that Vidya is very lagging in terms of success today
 kuch vidya jaisaa hi haal dekhne ko mil rahaa he kangana ranut kaa bhi
 After the success of the film 'queen' was also appreciated and many awards
 film 'tanu vaids manu riterns' kii safalata ke baad maano kii kangana ke naam kaa haahaakaar much gaya thik vaise hi jaise vidya kaa machaa tha
 Now Kangana's film 'katti Batti' has failed, just like it happened with Vidya
 ab kangana kii nigahen tiki hongi film 'rangoon' par jisamen saif ali khan hero hai or vishaal bharadwaj nirdeshak hai
 Before i tell you some such failures, first of all let me say that Deepika Padukone, Priyanka Chopra, Anushka Sharma or Kareena Kapoor on one side do spice films with Shah Rukh Salman, Shah Rukh, Aamir, Hrithik, Akshay or Ajay Devgan, on the other hand balance To keep it, Maricom also does a variety of films like NH10, Piku or Finding Fanny
 magar, kuch abhinetriyon ko mahila pradhan filmein milti hai jo ekadam alag or behtareen hoti hai
 With such a film, the actress goes to the pinnacle of success and after 2 to 3 films, she goes back down the same way
 vidya baalan ke saath bhi kuch aisa hi hua tha
 Though Vidya did some films with big stars, but after the success of the film 'no One Killed Jessica', she took a different route
 uske baad film 'da darty pikchar' main silk smita kii bhoomika ne vidya ko alag muqaam dilaa diya
 There was a noise that there is no actress bigger than Vidya
 media or darshakon ke is daawey ko or majboot aadhaar mila jab vidya kii agali film 'kahani' release hui
 The comments vidya ko kahani ne safalata or saraahna donon dilaain
 But as soon as 'ghanachakkar' flopped, Vidya suddenly came on the backfoot because it was also a female-oriented film
 uske baad vidya kii film 'shaadi ke said iffect' flop hui or uske baad 'bobi jasoos' bhi nahin chali or is saal film 'hamaari adhuri kahani' bhi naakaam ho gai
 Although Vidya performed well in her films, perhaps she did not balance in the commercial and masala films
 or nateeja ye he ki vidya aaj safalata ke maamle main bahut pichad chuki hai
 Kangana Ranaut is also getting to see some similar situation
 film 'queen' kii safalata ke baad saraahna bhi mili or kai puruskaar bhi
 After the success of the film 'tanu Weds Manu Returns', it was as if the name of Kangana was created, just like Vidya had created
 ab kangana kii film 'katti batti' naakaam ho chuki he thik vaise hi jaise vidya ke saath hua tha
 Now Kangana will have her eyes on the film 'rangoon' in which Saif Ali Khan is the hero and Vishal Bhardwaj is the director
 vidya baalan ke saath bhi kuch aisa hi hua tha
 Though Vidya did some films with big stars, but after the success of the film 'no One Killed Jessica', she took a different route
 uske baad film 'da darty pikchar' main silk smita kii bhoomika ne vidya ko alag muqaam dilaa diya
 There was a noise that there is no actress bigger than Vidya
 media or darshakon ke is daawey ko or majboot aadhaar mila jab vidya kii agali film 'kahani' release hui
 The comments vidya ko kahani ne safalata or saraahna donon dilaain
 But as soon as 'ghanachakkar' flopped, Vidya suddenly came on the backfoot because it was also a female-oriented film
 uske baad vidya kii film 'shaadi ke said iffect' flop hui or uske baad 'bobi jasoos' bhi nahin chali or is saal film 'hamaari adhuri kahani' bhi naakaam ho gai
 Although Vidya performed well in her films, perhaps she did not balance in the commercial and masala films
 or nateeja ye he ki vidya aaj safalata ke maamle main bahut pichad chuki hai
 Kangana Ranaut is also getting to see some similar situation
 film 'queen' kii safalata ke baad saraahna bhi mili or kai puruskaar bhi
 After the success of the film 'tanu Weds Manu Returns', it was as if the name of Kangana was created, just like Vidya had created
 ab kangana kii film 'katti batti' naakaam ho chuki he thik vaise hi jaise vidya ke saath hua tha
 Now Kangana will have her eyes on the film 'rangoon' in which Saif Ali Khan is the hero and Vishal Bhardwaj is the director
 vidya ko kahani ne safalata or saraahna donon dilaain

 kuch vidya jaisaa hi haal dekhne ko mil rahaa he kangana ranut kaa bhi
 After the success of the film 'queen' was also appreciated and many awards
 film 'tanu vaids manu riterns' kii safalata ke baad maano kii kangana ke naam kaa haahaakaar much gaya thik vaise hi jaise vidya kaa machaa tha
 Now Kangana's film 'katti Batti' has failed, just like it happened with Vidya
 ab kangana kii nigahen tiki hongi film 'rangoon' par jisamen saif ali khan hero hai or vishaal bharadwaj nirdeshak hai
