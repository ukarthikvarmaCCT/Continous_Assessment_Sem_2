 com / esjbysigfl rashtriya janata dal ke adhyaksh lalu prasad ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki nitish kumaar sarkaar kaa chah maheene tak virodh na karne kaa unka vrath samaapt ho gaya he or ab vah bihar ke gaanvon kaa daurakar vartmaan sarkaar kii pole kholenge
 Talking to reporters after the party's activist conference in Patna, Lalu said, "after Nitish Kumar won the assembly elections, i said that i will not oppose him for six months
" yahi kaaran he ki main dilli main rah rahaa tha
 Now more than six months have passed
 unhone kaha ki is dauraan yah bhram bhi failaayaa gaya ki vah mantri pad paane ke liye dilli main baithe hue hai
 He accused the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) of conspiring and manipulating leaders of other parties
 haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha ki kisi ke jane se kisi party kaa vajood samaapt nahin hota
 Prasad said that Nitish Kumar was immersed in ego and said that in the present government, scams are scams
 unhone nitish par bihar rajya audyogic vikaas praadhikaran (biada) kii jameen ko oune-paune daam main apane chaheton ko dene kaa aarope lagaaya or isaki jaanch kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) se karaane kii maang kii
 He alleged that like a Raja, Nitish also divided the land like 'first come, first serve'
 sieji kii report se bhi yah sabit ho gaya he ki rajya main kitna ghotla hua he
 He demanded that all the scams be investigated by the CBI
 prasad ne kaha ki bihar kii janata main aakrosh he or ab vah gaanvon kii ore jaaenge
 He said that RJD will conduct 'patna March' in October
 duniya ke sabase kathin kaamon main ek hota he ladkaa hona, kyonki kai baar sirf ladkaa hone ke chalate aapako un galatiyon ke badale bhi sunanaa pad jaataa he jo aapane kabhi kii hi nahin
 You cannot cry, you cannot stay ill for long, by default your handwriting is bad, every fourth day you have to touch your face with a touch, you cannot sit in the bus-train even if the seat is empty
 lekin in sab se badi samasya hoti he fasebuk par profile pikchar chunate vakt, saath hi whatsap or saat-bhaant ke anya miseging eps ke liye alag-alag photo chunate hue bhi
 Actually the problem starts because you cannot use photoshop even if you want, this is an unannounced rule of boys that like awww-a xxrep 4 w it is also left for the girls, instead the contrast is definitely increased slightly, Only in the name of photoediting, boys have the right to black and white photos or to put a border
 photo main aap zyada mote dikhnaa nahin chaahate, dublaa hona abhishaap he, aap bin nahaye yaa dadhi-moonch badhaakar photo daalane kii soch hi nahin sakate, matlab maheene ke pachchis din to bekaar gaye, saath hi nahaaya-dhoyaa hona bhi khatarnaak he kyonki aglaa sidhe 'aaj naha liya be, kitte saal me paani daala aalsi, insaan lag raha hai' likh kar khadey-khadey dho saktaa he
 Costumes have to be taken care of with the costumes, 'dudapa' can be corrupt if you are seen in front of the temple, you have to get away from the 'tap and draft beer gets here', or even behind the pan
 If the GPS location comes with the photo, then you can get stuck because sitting in Chirhula, you have reported half the friendlist on the phone to be in Pune
 aap piviar ke saamne photo nahin daal sakate varna wo garal-friend jise aapane looj moshan kaa bahaanaa markar taraka diya tha, rasad-kumuk lekar dhaava bol sakati he
 Many times, while taking a photo, you have to hide a part of the face and give a pose with a semi-photogeshwar, because there are black marks on the other eye that cross in the intersection, you cannot look innocent because he likes your matured look, and in the matured look
 No friend request receives
 or sabase dukhad ye ki ladke hone ke kaaran aap hont sikod kar selfi bhi nahin le sakate, or le-dekar ek bhang kii photo aa bhi gai to kya? 49 janon ko tag karne par bhi das like or nau beijjati vaale cament se zyada to kuch milanaa he nahin

 During a White House press conference, Obama told reporters, "I don't think Snowden was a patriot
" ek sawaal ke jawaab main obama ne kaha, sachai yah he ki snowden par dhokhadhadi ke teen aarope lagaae gaye hai
 If he really feels that he is right, then like every ordinary American citizen, he can come here, appear before the court with his lawyer and present his side

 In response to a question, Obama said, the truth is that Snowden has been charged with three counts of fraud
 agar use vastav main lagata he ki vah sahi he, to har aam america naagarik kii tarah vah yahaan aa saktaa he, apane vakil ke saath adaalat ke samaksh pesh ho saktaa he or apana paksh rakh saktaa he

 dilli main aaj nunatam taapmaana 14
 7 degrees
 rahaa, jo saamaanya se paanch degree se
 Was more
 mausam vibhaag ne aaj barish or boondabandi kii sambhaavna vyakt kii he, jabaki adhiktam taapmaana 20 se 30 degree ke bich rahane kii sambhaavna he
 The department has also predicted thunderstorms and hail in the national capital
 tees hazari court main vakil or police ke bich hinsak jhadpon kaa ek or video saamne aayaa he
 The video indicated what happened to the female DCP that day
 wo vardi main thim
 Police personnel were in uniform around them
 yah video hataash karne vaala he
 If a DCP is surrounded in this way, they are attacked in this way, then where is the common man safe and with whom
 beshak yah sab jaanch kaa vishay he lekin court ne bhi isaki reporting par roak nahin lagaai he
 What is seen in the video is terrible
 jab adaalaton kaa parisar surakshit nahin he to nyaay kahaan milegaa
 This incident has happened in Delhi, there is no voice from the Supreme Court
 sabase pehle aap is video main aag dekhte hai
 The flame of fire suddenly rises up
 us taraf kuch police ke jawan bhaagate ja rahe hai
 But when the crowd becomes angry, the soldiers are running away to save their lives
 un par hamalaa ho rahaa hota he
 After some time, the lawyers are seen running and the police too
 do mahilaayein kinare ho jaati hai
 Of these, there are also two women lawyers in black coats and one woman in simple dress
 teenon bheed kii taraf dekhati hai
 Then everyone looks towards the crowd
 kuch log munh par kapadaa rakh kar bhaage aa rahe hai
 Some policemen are running away
 tezi se bhaagti hai
 Look left
 ek vine khadi he or kinare aag kii lapat uth rahi he
 Police personnel are seen running there but the lawyers grab the soldiers and kill them
 ek jawan funs jaataa he
 He is killed
 safed shart main ek shaks police ke jawan ko pakad letaa he or martha he
 The young man does not raise his hand
 vah haath chhudaa kar us taraf bhaagta he jis tarah kuch jawan disipi ko cover kar laa rahe hai
 It is obvious that Jawan is covering his DCP by playing on his life
 disipi ke saath kya ho rahaa hoga andaaza lagaaya ja saktaa he
 At that time, the lawyers on the covering jawans break up from all four sides
 yah sab saamne se dikh rahaa he
 DCP is seen in the camera
 unka sar dhakaa hua he taaki chot se bachaaya ja sake
 a lawyer pulls a young man behind them
 vahiin khadi eco car ke bagal main le jaakar maarane lagata he
 The young man then escapes and escapes to cover the DCP
 jawan maar khaataa he lekin haath nahin uthaata he
 He comes in front of the DCP that has surfaced, and then he starts grabbing one of his hands
 ek sipaahi ko jor se martha he
 You will see a man in a white shirt picking up a piece of brick
 eent lekar vah saamne aata he magar chalaata nahin he magar uske peeche ek shaks eent chalaata he
 Till then, the DCP hands leave and turn back
 magar cover karne vaala unhen nahin chodta he
 He leads
 ek mahila afasar par vakil tut pade hai or is tarah se maar rahe hai
 Lawyers have been injured by the police bullet
 uski jaanch ho rahi he lekin yah video bataata he ki tees hazari court main kya paristhiti thi
 The women IPS and that too DCP were surrounded by the mob
 unke saath kya hua yah tabhi saaf hoga jab ve shikaayat darj karaayengi
 But this video shows how terrible the attack was
 agar dilli police ke javaanon ne apni disipi ko cover nahin kiya hota to wo hinsa kii shikaar ho sakati thim
 You will see in the video that the soldiers are getting killed, but their first priority is to somehow get the DCP safe
 un javaanon par peeche se hamalaa ho rahaa he lekin jawaab main koi jawan ek mukka bhi chalaata nahin dikh rahaa he
 All are saving DCP
 yah sab court ke parisar main hua he
 Next, we will explain the court
 bharat ke nyaay tantra kii ek khaasiyat he
 The trial here lasts for several generations
 acchhee baat he ki isamen kuch sudhaar hua he
 The average time to settle cases in subordinate courts of India now takes just 5 years
 sirf 5 saal hi to intazaar karnaa hota he insaaf ke liye
 Poor and ordinary citizens of India wait five years to settle a case, what can be a better example of trust in justice
 23 lakh cese aise hai jo 10 saal puraane hai
 45% of backlogged lawsuits are in UP Maharashtra, Bengal, Bihar and Gujarat
 yah to sirf deree kaa aankada he
 The condition of the police system to bring the case to court is also bad
 kahin pad khaali hai to kahin padon ko kam kar diya gaya he
 Except for the non resident Indian, everyone knows this truth but the demand for a fair and agile system in the justice system is not at the center of the debate
 is sandarbh main pehali baar ek india justise report ai he
 This report was released in Delhi on Thursday
 tata trust kii madad se vidhi centre for legal policy, centre for soshal justise, kaaman coz, kaamanwealth human ritis inishiative, daksh, tata institute aaf soshal science prayaas jaisi sansthaaon ne 18 maheene tak nyaaypalika ke tantra par research kiya he
 The judiciary has four pillars
 police, jail, kanoonee sahaayta or nyaaypalika
 Each state has studied five years of trends in these four regions
 yah dekhne ke liye ki rajyon main nyaay vyavastha tak pahunch or insaaf dene main sudhaar kii niyat or niti ko lagu karne ke liye kya kya kiya gaya
 Have seen the budget, have also seen how many people are there in court court system, how many people are not
 tabhi pataa chalaa he ki bharat kaa jo justise system he uski haalat kharaab he
 If we do not bring this problem to the center of the debate, then all things will become air
 isiilie aasaan he kisi ko farji cese main fansaa dena, mukademon ko atka dena or zindagi barbaad kar dena
 Because of these weaknesses in the justice system, gangs of miscreants rule the power system
 report kahati he ki bharat apni jidipi kaa maamuli hissaa yani 0
 08 percent spends on judiciary
 rajyon main to or bhi buree haalat he
 In the same month of February, Minister of State for Law PP Chaudhary had said in a written reply that according to the 2011 census, there are 20 judges on a population of one million, including the subordinate judiciary, the High Court and the Supreme Court
 jo 2014 main sudhakar das lakh logon par 17
 5 judges
 india justise report ke anusaar 1 karod se adhik kii aabaadi vaale 18 rajyon main 50,000 kii aabaadi par ek jaj hai
 Which is very rare
 2016-17 ke saal main ek bhi hai court yaa adhinsth court main jajon kii sankhya puri nahin thi
 The 18 large and medium-sized states had 25 per cent fewer judges in each High Court
 in 18 rajyon main se 6 rajyon main adhinsth court ke str 25% se adhik pad khaali hai
 There should be a total of 23,754 judges in India but about 4000 judges are less
 agar saare pad bhar jaaen to 4071 court rum kii zarurat pad jaaegi
 Think what justice would be got in this situation
 jajon par kitna dabaav hota hoga
 The judges of the subordinate court keep telling us the problem of stationery
 bihar, gujarat, jharkhand or upi ke adhinsth court main 30 pratishat se adhik pad khaali hai
 There are about 40 percent of cases in subordinate courts of Bihar which are five years old
 yahi nahin india justise report ne 18 rajyon main pehali baar adaalaton kii rekking kii he
 Which state has better judiciary
 isamen hameshaa kii tarah uttar pradesh aakhri paaydaan par he
 Is at number 18
 bihar upi se ek paaydaan upar he
 Is at number 17
 jharkhand neeche se tisare number par he, 16 wein number par
 Maharashtra ranks first and Kerala second
 tamilnadu kaa kaa stha teesraa he or punjab kaa chauthaa he
 In this report an interesting study of the mechanism of the judiciary has been made, which shows why one does not get out after being stuck in the court
 22 pratishat police vibhaag main pad khaali hai
 Obviously, there will be no proper investigation or charge sheet will be better
 jail main 33 pratishat pad khaali hai
 20 percent of the posts in the court are vacant
 ye saare aankade 2016-17 ke hai
 Things may have improved, it cannot be expected
 gujarat akelaa rajya he jahaan 5 saal main police, jail or court ke padon ko kam kar diya gaya he
 In Jharkhand, the number of vacant posts has increased in five years
 yani bhartee nahin hui he
 68 percent of the prisoners are under trial in whose case the investigation or trial has not been completed
 5 saal main keval 13 rajya aise jahaan under trial kii sankhya main kami laai gai he
 According to this report, the quota of scheduled castes, tribes and other backward classes has not been fully filled in any state
 sirf karnataka hai jahaan sara kota puraa bharaa gaya he lekin vahaan bhi anusuchit jatiyon ke cote kii 4 pratishat siten khaali rah gai hai
 There is a severe budget deficit in most states
 10 rajyon main police ke padon kii sankhya main katautee kii gai he
 While the population has grown
 24 rajya aise hai jahaan police main afasar str par 20 pratishat pad khaali hai
 Delay in justice as well as increase in unemployment
 in padon ko bharaa jaataa to berojgaare bhi dur hoti or nyaay bhi samay se miltaa
 Since 1995, only 1
5 million people have been given legal assistance by legal services
 jabaki 80 fisadi aabaadi garib hone ke kaaran legal aid par nirbhar he
 That is, the legal aid system also fails
 nishulk kanoonee sahaayta ke maamle main ek vyakti par maatr 75 paise kharch ho rahe hai
 Sushil Mahapatra spoke to former Supreme Court Justice Madan B
 Lokur
 pradooshan ke maamle main focus dilli par he magar bharat ke baaki shahar bhi kachare ke dher se dhankane lage hai
 No one knows where the crores of rupees were spent on cleaning the drains because the dirt is there
 nateeja beemaari is tarah fail rahi he ki shesh bharat tak khabaren bhi nahin pahunch paati he
 Supreme Court Justices Arun Mishra and Justice Deepak Gupta should watch this video
 andaaza hoga ki dilli se sate ilaakon main kachare ke pahaado kaa kya ho rahaa he
 It is from Rudrapur in Uttarakhand
 hamaare darshak kamaljit ne banaakar bheja he
 The trash has been burning in the trucking ground for ten days
 isse nipatane kaa yahi tarika batch gaya he ki log maang karne lagate hai ki hamaare yahaan se hataakar ise kahin or le jaaya jaae magar bhul jate hai ki vahaan bhi log hi rahete hai
 a separate land has been found for this, but how will this garbage be removed and if it goes there, it will fill the day before
 traching ground main kooday kii jagah nahin bachi he to haive ke bagal main kooda daalkar jalaayaa ja rahaa he
 Amar Ujala has written that if it continues to fizzle, Rudrapur will become like Delhi
 haldwani, nainital, rudrapur main kooday ke pahaado kii tasviir supreme court main pesh kii jaani chahie
 Corporations will not do this
 hona hota to ho gaya hota
 Now it should be seen whether there will be some reforms strictly by the Supreme Court
 3 lakh kii aabaadi vaale rudpur main yah haal ho gaya he
 Fire is not good in land fill
 vaayu pradooshan main yah bhi bada kaaran he
 Everyone gets the attention of farmers, but who will take care of these landfills burning in small towns
 jaraa kanpur par bhi nazar daaliye
 Kanpur's air quality index on November 7 was 366, which is considered very poor
 5 november ko air quality index 444 tha
 Kanpur's air quality index has been very poor throughout the week
 kanpur main dengue ke marizon kii sankhya 1200 ho gai he
 1300 MT of garbage is released every day in Kanpur
 bhauti main solid west management kaa yah plant aadhe kachare kaa hi nistaaran kar paata he
 Looking at this mountain, you can wonder what is the condition of disposal of garbage out of Delhi
 yahi nahin kanpur main jagah-jagah kachare phenke ja rahe hai or jalaae ja rahe hai
 After burning, the waste is less visible, but its smoke spoils the air
 aag lagane main nigam ke karchamariyon kii bhi bhoomika kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 Employees of the corporation did not speak
 kanpur kaa air quality index kaaphi khatarnaak ho gaya tha
 Seeing the amount of filth, it seems that the will of the institutions of Kanpur has been exhausted
 amar ujaalaa kii report ke anusaar kanpur main dengue se 51 log mar gaye hai
 8 people died on Wednesday
 kanpur ke sarkari aspataalon main bistar bhar gaye hai
 People are also coming from nearby areas
 hamaare sahyogi ne kanpur ke mukhya chikitsa adhikari ko massej bhi kiya magar aankadon ko lekar koi jawaab nahin aayaa
 CMO Ashok Shukla's statement in Amar Ujala has been printed that we do not accept dengue reports of private pathologists
 kanpur main sirf ek vyakti kii dengue se maut hui he
 But the statement of Ashok Shukla has printed that the number of dengue patients in Kanpur has exceeded 1200
 jab tak kanpur or rudrapur jaise shaharon main kachare kii samasya par dhyaan nahin jayega, vahaan pradooshan ke kaarnon par nazar nahin jaaegi, sirf dilli dilli karne se kya hoga
 Look at India from the point of view of pollution, see India from the eyes of the judiciary, your plans will change
 na to dilli se bhaag sakate hai or na kanpur vaale bhaag kar dilli aa sakate hai
 The hospitals will be doing well
 dilli main air quality index halki barish ke baad bhi karaab hi rahaa
 As long as there is no heavy rain, the people of Delhi will not get relief
 hawa kaa rukh bhi dilli kii madad nahin kar rahaa he
 It seems that the wind may go somewhere from Delhi
 lekin jo pradooshit hawa he wo agar dilli waalon ke liye jaanaleva he to kanpur or sonipat waalon ke liye bhi he
 Following the Supreme Court order, investigations are being conducted in 300 places
 aap is report ko is liye dekhie taaki aap patna kanpur or bhatinda main sawaal kar saken ki unke yahaan bhi pradooshan fail rahaa he, dilli ke jaisaa hi magar koi na dekhne aa rahaa he or na kuch ho rahaa he
 Delhi is one such area on the Ghaziabad border where these factories operate among the densely populated
 aabaadi ke bich chal rahi ye factriyaan raat ke vakt bade paimaane par pradooshan failaati hai
 The closure of these factories in Delhi is also difficult because the authority to seal factories is with the district administration, the license to look after the license, the MCD with the right to check pollution, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee, the power cut off BSES and threats
 It is not possible to carry out this action without the cooperation of Delhi Police

 Australia are gearing up for a comeback after a crushing defeat in the first Test match, but rain could shatter their hopes in the second Test cricket match against South Africa starting here on Saturday
 hobart main somvaar tak baari barish kii bhavishyavaanee kii gai he jo ki match kaa teesraa din hoga
 This is not good news for Australia, who are desperate to make a comeback with a 177-run defeat in the first Test in Perth
 australia is match main chaar gendbaajon ke saath utarane kii soch rahaa he
 Captain Steve Smith and his team have been under the scanner of critics due to the mistakes of the first match and now the team management does not want to make any mistake in the selection
 smith ke paas haalanki kai vikalp hai
 Smith confirmed that batsman Adam Voges, who landed at number five, was fit and was troubled by a hamstring injury
 unhen iske saath hi sanket diye ki australia chah ballebaajon ke saath utar saktaa he jisase olerounder mishael marsh or spinner nathan leone ko baahar baithna pad saktaa he
 He told reporters, "there is no decision yet on the team
 kal subah tak intjaar kariye
 We will decide to watch the wicket again and predict the weather
 agle do din ke liye bhavishyavaanee acchhee nahin he or isliye hamen tas tak intjaar karnaa hoga
 ' smith se poocha gaya ki kya ve chaar gendbaajon ke saath utarane kii soch rahe hai kyonki barish ke kaaran gendbaajon ko paryaapt vishram kaa mauka mil saktaa he, unhone kaha, ‘abhi pakkaa nahin he
 It depends on the selectors and they will decide tomorrow
 hamen intjaar karnaa hoga
 Anything is possible
 ’ Joe Burns is likely to open the innings with David Warner while Joe Maini may get his first Test appearance
 tasmania ke tej gendbaaj jaikson bird ko bhi team main shaamil kiya gaya he
 The selectors have put Callum Fagrusan in the squad for the cover of the first Voges and he could also be an option if Australia take on the additional batsman
 jahaan tak dakshin africa kaa sawaal he to vah lambey samay baad kisi aise match main utrega jisamen abi divilliars or del sten donon uski ekadash main nahin honge
 The comments divilliars chotil hone ke kaaran daure par nahin aae jabaki sten ke kandhe main pehle test match ke dauraan chot lag gai or unhen iskaa oparation karwaanaa pad saktaa he
 In such a situation, he will have to stay out for six months
 cagiso rabada ne sten kii anupasthiti main perth main acchhee bhoomika nibhaai or 'main of da match' bane
 Stan can be replaced by Kyle Abot
 morne morkal bhi feet ho jate hai to unhen bhi antim ekadash main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 If the conditions are favorable for the fast bowlers, then South Africa can also come down with four fast bowlers and in this case Keshav Maharaj will have to sit outside
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) yah australia ke liye acchhee khabar nahin he jo perth main pehle test match main 177 ran kii haar se vaapasi karne ke liye betaab he
 Australia is looking to get into this match with four bowlers
 captain steve smith or unki team pehle match kii galatiyon ke kaaran aalochakon ke nishane par he or ab team prabandhan chayan main kisi tarah kii galati nahin karnaa chahta
 Smith has several options though
 smith ne pushti kii ki paanchaven number par utarane vaale ballebaaj adam voges feet hai vah mansapeshiyon main khinchaav se pareshaan the
 He was also hinted that Australia might come down with six batsmen which could lead to all-rounder Mitchell Marsh and spinner Nathan Lyon sitting out
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘team ko lekar abhi koi faisla nahin hua
 Wait till tomorrow morning
 ham phir se wicket dekhne or mausam kii bhavishyavaanee ke anusaar hi faisla karenge
 The prediction for the next two days is not good and so we will have to wait till the toss
 ’ Smith was asked if he was thinking of landing with four bowlers as the bowlers could get enough rest due to rain, he said, "not sure yet
" yah chayankartaaon par nirbhar karata he or ve kal faisla karenge
 We will have to wait
 kuch bhi sambhav he
 ' david warner ke saath jo burns ke pari kii shuruuaat karne kii sambhaavna he jabaki jo meni ko apana pehla test khilne kaa mauka mil saktaa he
 Tasmania fast bowler Jackson Bird has also been included in the squad
 chayankartaaon ne pehle voges ke cover ke liye calum fagarusan ko team main rakhaa he or yadi australia atirikt ballebaaj ko lekar utarataa he to vah bhi ek vikalp ho sakate hai
 As far as South Africa is concerned, after a long time he will go into a match in which both AB de Villiers and Dale Steyn will not be in his XI
 tippaniyan De Villiers did not come on tour due to injury, while Steyn's shoulder suffered an injury during the first Test and he may have to undergo surgery
 aisi sthiti main unhen chah maheene tak baahar rahanaa padegaa

 antarrashtriya cricket parishad (isisi) ne haalanki bisisiai ke aagrah ko thukaraate hue kaha tha ki is tarah ke maamalon main uski koi bhoomika nahin he
 In a press conference to announce Tata Motors' Harrier 'to be the official partner of IPL, Chaudhary was asked if it was a mistake not to specifically mention the name of Pakistan in that letter, he said,' i did not write the letter
 ’pulavama aatanki hamale main siarpief ke 40 javaanon ke shahid hone ke baad yah patr bisisiai siio rahul johri ne prashaskon kii samiti (sioe) ke saath salaah mashvire ke baad likhaa tha
 The attack was claimed by jaish-e-mohammed, a Pakistan-based terrorist organization
 choudhary ne kaha, ‘isisi ke chairman (shashaank manohar) ne is mudde par bayaan diya tha or unhone kaha tha ki yah maamla isisi ke daayre se baahar kaa he
 The ICC rejected the demand to end the relationship with the PAK, saying- it is not our job to ask if the BCCI made a mistake in preparing this proposal, they said, 'I want to put all the speculation to a stand that there is a difference in the outlook was not
 bisisiai ke siio ne isisi ke saath likhit samvaad kiya tha
 There were two points in this dialogue - the first point was about security
 ’ is patr kii saamagree ke sandarbh main choudhary ne kaha ki vishwa cap se pehle bisisiai kii mukhya chintaa khilaadiyon kii suraksha he
 Chaudhary said, 'the second issue was related to the suggestion that India and other members of the ICC should not take part with teams that come from areas where certain events take place, but the letter does not mention the area Was
 ’unhone kaha, ‘isisi chairman ne is par isisi kii niti banane waal ekmaatr sanstha isisi board se charchaa ke baad kaha tha ki is par pratikriya dena yaa faisla karnaa isisi ke daayre main nahin he
 Chaudhary said that it is necessary to resolve the confrontation between the BCCI and the World anti-doping Agency (WADA) so that the WADA does not declare the ICC to be non-compliant
 unhone kaha, ‘yah ek mudda he
 The global body (WADA) has been talking to the ICC for some time and the point is that all the competing countries of the ICC have to join the National Trial Tribunal
 ’choudhary ne kaha, ‘isisi ke ekmaatr sadsy jitne ab tak iskaa virodh kiya he vah bisisiai he or iskaa kaaran sabhi jaanate hai or yahi kaaran he ki yah mudda atyaavashyak he
 The ICC chairman is of the view that given the importance of the case, he will soon talk with the BCCI, so that the ICC is not declared to be non-compliant
 ’unhone kaha ki ipel ke turant baad 30 may se hone vaale vishwa cap ko dekhte hue chayankarta bhartiya vanade antarrashtriya team ke mukhya khilaadiyon ke kaam ke boj ke prabandhan par kaam kar rahe hai
 Chaudhary said, 'it would not be appropriate to elaborate at this time, but the selectors are also working on it
 ’BCCI kii kirakiri, ICC kii baithak ke agenda main PAK kaa bahishkaar nahin !choudhary se poocha gaya tha ki kya ipel frenchiziyaan saidhantik rup se iske liye raji ho gai hai
 He also said that work is also underway to make IPL matches earlier
 ipel siio hemang amin ne kaha ki is mudde par vichaar ho rahaa he
 He said, 'last year we made the playoff time earlier at 7 pm
 ham ab bhi vichaar kar rahe hai ki ise thodaa pehle kiya jaae yaa 8 baje hi rakhaa jaae, kyonki isse dopaher ke match par bhi asar padegaa
 For the past so many years, we have been playing 12 to 15 matches in the afternoon and this will have an impact on them
 ’amin ne kaha, ‘khilaadiyon kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana hoga, kyonki agar ham 8 baje ke match ko pehle karenge, to dopaher ke match kaa samay bhi badalanaa hoga
 We hope to announce the time within a week

 Pallava Bagla and Subhadra Menon's book 'REACHING FOR THE STARS, INDIA'S JOURNEY TO MARS AND BEYOND' takes us into such countless stories of the journey of the Isers
 puri kitaab rochak prasangon se bharaa ek aisa jangal he, jiske har ped or vanaspati ke bare main aap jaanakar romanchit hone lagate hai
 Mangalyaan's success was soon subdued under the cleanliness drive brought to India's public life, but this book has saved those stories for generations
 isro ke maujuuda nideshak dow
 If Radhakrishnan was not proficient in Kathakali, he would not be able to travel long in this secluded journey of science
 mangal mishan ke program diarector em annadurai ke gaanv main pani kii aapurti tab hui, jab inhone chandrayan ke sahare chand par pani khoj liya
 There are some such stories that turn this book into a science fiction
 is baat ke baavjood ki har kahani sachhee he
 Within 15 months, 500 engineers have not only sent Mangalyaan to work day and night, but have set an example for the whole world
 isro america kaa nasa nahin he, balki nasa chaahe to apni tulana isro se kar saktaa he
 Pallava says that when Mangalyaan was launched on 5 November 2013, the team of scientists had to check 803 agenda during the countdown before that
 jab antim kuch minute rah gaye, to us vakt main sau se adhik ection kii checking kii jaani thi ki sab thik he yaa nahin
 But the weather turned bad at the last moment
 pallav likhte hai ki sabaki dhadakanen ruk gayi ki kahin laanch radd to nahin ho jayega
 This journey from the Red Fort to the Red Planet did not hang anywhere in the balance
 aisa hua nahin
 Mangalyaan completed the journey for ten months and made his place in the orbit of Mars

 The system itself was made checkable

 The Pallavas write the story of the first rocket launch

 The session was stopped for a while and everyone's eyes were on the launch

 No one knows who named Mangalyaan
 iskaa elaan 15 agast 2012 ko manmohan singh ne laal kile se kiya tha
 There is no Mangalyaan in his written speech, but Manmohan Singh called Mangalyaan and the same name remained
 usee tarah jab chandrayan kaa naam pradhanmantri vaajapeyi ko sujhaayaa gaya to vaajapeyi ne uske aage ek jod diya
 Realizing this cannot be the last campaign for a country like India
 yah pehla hoga or baad main kadiyaan judati jaaengi
 i wish this book was in Hindi
 pallav ne bharosa diya he ki ve jald hi hindi main pathakon ke liye uplabdh karaayenge
 Everyone should read this anecdote of Mangalyaan

 Those who do not see Indian institutions in the world rating and commit suicide, should see the record of isro's performance
 solah hazaar karmchaariyon vaala isro ek khaas pattern par chalata he
 Being a government is not less than a corporate model
 iske senior utane hi junior hai jitne junior senior ho jate hai
 isro's model of team spirit is its own

 Here, Economist Prime Minister Manmohan Singh could not control inflation in 9 years whereas Atal Bihari Vajpayee did not allow inflation to increase for six years

 Apart from this, Rajnath Singh said that it is necessary to give three years of military training to students after higher secondary so that no one should look with eyes towards India's borders because the country is in danger

 Thousands of youth along with Anna came on the streets and expressed that they are angry with corruption in the country

 The message of stage cleanliness and Beti Bachao was also given as if the leaders had left their politics and started a new tradition, but something strange happened as soon as they got off the stage
 manch par meyar ne diya svachh bharat kaa sandesh vipaksh kii netaa ne diya beti bachaao kaa sandeshjab sita mata vidaa ho rahi thi tab manch se ramlila ke kirdaar ko nibhaa rahi purvi dilli nagar nigam kii mahayor satya sharma ne swatchta kaa sandesh dete hue kaha ki hamen apane aasapaas saaf safai rakhni chahie

 Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was once again made Sarkaryavah, but after he was elected, there is a buzz that a section of the Sangh is not happy with Bhaiyaji Joshi becoming Sarkaryavah? Earlier, there was speculation that Dattatreya Hosabole would be made Sarkaryavah
 kai news channel or akhabaaron main yah khabar bhi ai ki hosbhole sarkarywah banenge
 But in the end, the name of Bhaiyyaji Joshi was stamped
 ab ve aagaamee teen varsh (2018-2021) ke liye sarkarywah rahenge
 Remind you that before the Sarkaryavah election, Bhaiyyaji Joshi had denied the desire to become Sarkaryavah again, citing age
 aise main is charchaa ne jor pakad liya tha ki 63 varshiya hosbhole unki jagah lenge
 Because there were two reasons for this
 pehla to yah ki hosbhole, piem narendra modi or bijepi adhyash amit shah ke kareebi the, jabaki doosraa kaaran yah ki aane vaale samay main karnataka chunaav hai or 63 varshiya hosbhole karnataka se taalluq rakhte hai
 In such a situation, Hosbole can play a big role in Karnataka
 sangh sutron kaa ek tark yah bhi he ki hosbhole ko sarkarywah banavaakar pradhanmantri modi aresas par bhi apni pakad majboot karnaa chaahate the
 This also led to the belief in a section of the Sangh that if Hosbole Sarkaryavah is formed, then the supporters of Prime Minister Modi will dominate the RSS
 isse bhaajapa ke liye maardarshak kii bhoomika main sangh kamjor padane lagegaa
 It is said that lobbying was first seen in the Union elections
 isse sangh kor kamity kaa ek varg naaraaz bhi ho gaya or hosbhole kii jagah dobaaraa bhaiyyaji joshi ko chunaa gaya
 Why there is restlessness in the association about hosbole
 
 
 bataa denki dattatreya hosbolesang kor kamity ke aise pehle shaks hai jinke saarvajanik jivan kii shuruuaat sangh prachaarak banane se pehle hi akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad (abivipi) se hui thi
 He was also the Organization General Secretary of the RSS for two decades in the ABVP
 unhone puri tarah apane aap ko aresas kii gatividhiyon main lagaaya
 He had the advantage of having access to top leaders in the BJP that he directly joined the core committee of the Sangh
 kya he sarkarywah pad
 
 
 Sarsanghchalak holds the largest post in the Sangh
 is pad par abhi mohan bhagwat hai
 According to the RSS constitution, he is rated as a guide-guide, so he does not play an active role in the daily activities of the Sangh
 aise main unke maargdarshan main sangh kaa puraa kaamkaaj sarkarywah or unke saath chaar sah-sarkarywah hi dekhte hai
 In corporate terms, Sarkaryavah actually plays the role of CEO of a company
 kya hota asar?raajnneetik jaankaron kii maane to yadi pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah sarkarywah ke pad par dattatreya hosbhole ko laane main kaamyaab hote to tikat or mantripad bantwaare main sangh ke hone vaale hastkshep par asar hota
 At the same time, the cadres of the Sangh could be used to make full political alliances

 In the general election to be held in Pakistan on July 25, the international mastermind of terror, founder of the Milli Muslim League, lashkar-e-taiba and jamaat-ut-dawa mastermind Hafiz Saeed and his big terrorist henchmen are in the election fray
 hafiz said pratyaksh taur par chunavi maidan main nahin he, lekin uske 250 ummidavaar islamabad ko fatah karne kaa puraa sapana dekh rahe hai
 Hafiz Saeed, who used to fire India through gun and bomb, has a melody of nuclear attack on India every day
 loc se hataakar aatankiyon ko diya poling agent kaa kamasutron ne jaankaree di he ki pakistan kii kufia agency ne chunaavon ke najadik aate hi loc par maujuud lonching pad se aatankiyon ko kam kiya he jo pehle 600 ke aasapaas the
 Their numbers are around 270 to 280, with around 50 percent remaining
 sutron ne ye jaankaree di he ki hafiz said ne paak army or iesai kii madad se apane 300 aatankiyon ko loc ke lonching pad se bulaakar chunaav main poling agent kaa kaam diya he
 According to sources, government security Parahafiz Saeed is not confident, so he has deployed the Lashkar trader fighters to protect his son Talha and his son-in-law
 aatanki banenge hafiz ke bete ke chunavi agentitanaa hi nahin khufia report ke mutabik chunaav main gadabadi kii ashanka ke baad hafiz ne party kaa sanghathan or raajnneetik kaaryakartaaon ke bajaay lashkar sarganahafiz saidane kashmir main ghuspaith ke liye taiyaar aatankiyon ko chunaav prachaar main lagane kaa faisla kiya he
 Lashkar has also deployed the security office of his organization in addition to using the currently recalled terrorists for campaigning
 yani lashkar ke aatanki hafiz ke bete ke poling agent banenge
 Intelligence sources said that when the heir of Terrorist Hafiz Saeed wants to contest and become a leader, it is natural that the Lashkar terrorists will become election agents on the instructions of their boss
 khufia sutron ke mutabiqahaafiz saidane khud ravivaar ko muzafarabad main nae trend aatankiyon ko apane training camp se bulaayaa tha or unhen chunavi jimmedaari saunpi
 He had also spewed poison against India, but instead of giving cover fire to the infiltration of terrorists from across the border after the blast at an election rally in Peshawar, the priority of the Pakistan Army is now security of the general election for the Pakistan National Assembly to be held on 25 July
 7000 javaanon ko chunaav kii suraksha duty par lagayasutron ke mutabiq iske liye paak sena ne elosi se lagbhag 7000 javaanon ko waapas bulaakar chunaav kii suraksha duty par lagaaya he, jabaki antarashtriya seemaa se rangers ke 6000 jawan or afasaron ko waapas bulaakar chunaav kii suraksha duty main lagaaya he
 According to intelligence sources, there has been a sudden reduction in cross-border firing due to the changed tactics of the Pakistan Army
 janvari 2018 se 15 june tak yudghaviram ulanghan kii choti badi 1100 ghatana hui thi, lekin pichley 20 dinon main mahaj 10 baar seemaa par se firing hui he
 Pakistan's military has given its strength in conducting peaceful elections
 aatanki said ne elosi or antarrashtriya border se sena or rangers ke batalian ko waapas bulaakar chunaav duty main lagaaya he, jisase taliban ke aatanki hinsa na failaa sake
 According to the sources, the second major reason for the withdrawal of the Pakistani Army LOC and security forces from the international border is to avoid major losses to the Pakistan Army in retaliation from India
 kyonki ye bhi chunavi mudda ban saktaa he jiskaa khamiyaja sena ke samarthan se chunaav lard rahe lashkar or imran khan kii party ko uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 Incidents of infiltration will increase after elections According to intelligence sources, the incidents of terrorist infiltration from Pakistan will accelerate as soon as the elections are over
 saath hi cover fire dene ke liye pakistan se yudhviram ulanghan kii ghatnaon main izaafaa hoga
 The Indian Army and BSF are instructed to be vigilant in retaliation

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator Vinay Katiyar has questioned the BJP government's intent on the Ram temple issue in Ayodhya
 bhaajapa netaa vinay katiyaar ne kaha ki unhen nahin lagata he 2019 chunaav se pehle ram mandir banane kaa koi rasta nikalegaa
 According to Katiyar, struggle is the last way
 vah sangharsh kya hoga uske bare main katiyaar ne kuch bhi nahin kaha
 Katiyar also put the Sangh in the dock for delay in this matter
 unhone kaha ki sangh ne bhi bhi is maamle main pahal karne main der kar di
 The government did not appear serious about this matter
 bakaul katiyaar, 'shuruyaat se hi aisa lag rahaa tha sarkaar is mudde par koi kadam nahin uthaa rahi he
 On the issue of bringing the ordinance, Vinay Katiyar believes that neither the BJP government nor the BJP government has the requisite strength for it, because there will be no way out of bringing the ordinance, because the issue is not about building a Ram temple but the matter which is pending in the court
 It is a land dispute
 katiyaar ne kaha ki is par adhyadesh laane se phayda bhi kya hoga?vinay katiyaar ke mutabik is maamle main sarkaar or donon ne kaaphi der kar di he or dhire-dhire maamla donon ke haathon se nikalataa ja rahaa he
 Vinay Katiyar reiterated that struggle is the last way in this matter but did not say anything about what the conflict will be
 ram mandir maamle main supreme court kii taraf se sunwaayee kii janvari tak taarikh badaye jane ke baad bijepi sarkaar sawaalon ke ghere main he
 Their leaders, including allies, may be strongly advocating the construction of a Ram temple, but according to legal experts, there is no way for the government to find a solution to the Ram temple in this dispute

 rakesh sinha ne likhaa ki agar vipaksh ke netaa unhen bill par koi suzav dena chaahate hai to de sakate hai

 The meeting was ruckus

 The Congress councilors then demanded the Mayor for action on the chairman
 jab mahayor ne maang nahin suni to congressi parshad suman gurjar ne apni chappal hawa main uchhaalate hue mahayor kii or phenk di
 However the slippers fell to the mayor
 isse pehle congressi parshad mohan meena ne bhi sadan main bijepi parshadon ko juuta dikhaaya
 While this act done on behalf of a public representative has done away with the dignity of the house, now the demand for action against that councilor has also started to arise
 mahayor nirmal nahata to is prakaran par zyada kuch bolne se batch rahe hai, lekin up mahayor manoj bharaddhaj ne khul kar kaha he ki aise parshad par karrwai honi chahie
 However, the House of the Urban Government has now become a battleground for the people's representatives, where only the people's representatives responsible for the development of the city are taking away the dignity of the House

 In Bihar elections, all parties are involved in the politics of betting
 jitne netaa utani baaten
 Jumlas of Vikas, Jungleraj, Mandal, Kamandal have become common
 har raily main vikaas kii baat hoti to he lekin nishaanaa jati par hi hota he
 Everybody has got red on the electoral board, in which everyone has decorated their pieces according to caste
 haalat ye ho gai he ki ab har dal kaa netaa bheed main khadaa hokar khud ko kabhi ram to kabhi krishna to kabhi samraat ashok kaa vanshaj bataakar votaron ke saamne apni jholii failaane main laga he
 The BJP, talking about development, has promised laptops to students, scooties to meritorious girls, color tvs to dalit-mahadalit homes, saris and dhoti to the poor
 in sabake bich gaur karanevaali baat ye he ki isamen bhijati ko agerakhkar sochaa gaya he
 In Bihar, in the name of education, whether it is shepherd school, mid-day mill, bicycle, scooty or laptop, the level of education cannot be improved at all
 bihar main shiksha ke str ko sudhaarney ke liye sabase pehle sarkari skulon main behatar vyavastha ke saath yogya shikshakon kii paardarshee bahaali jaruri he
 Overall, it can be said that by making casteism a weapon, the people of Bihar have been misled by all these parties
 bihar kii ek samasyayah bhi ki yahaan kii bauddhik aabaadi in muddon par chuppi saadhe baithi hui he
 Generally, the intellectual population here either stays outside or away from mainstream politics
 aise main janata ke bich mutthi bhar rajanetaaon ke yaa phir chhutbhaiyye netaaon ke sandesh unke bich pahunch rahe hai
 If saints, voluntary organizations and all educated people unite and spread awareness against casteism, the picture of Bihar can be greatly enhanced
 raajnneetik netritv pichhadon se chhinana aasaan nahin
 Talking about Lalu Yadav, BJP kept him away from power in Bihar for 10 years with the help of Nitish
 hakeekat ke aaine main jhanken to nitish kabhi bhi lalu ke virdohi nahin balki aitihaasik prakriya main unke poorak the
 If Lalu Yadav did not come to Bihar, then Nitish would not have been a state of politics
 nitish nahin hote to jeethanram maanjhi jaise mahadalit kii ahmiyat nahin hoti
 If nitish-lalu were not there, then there is no current status of Paswan, Kushwaha and Manjhi in BJP politics
 aaj ham jise jati kii raajnneeti kah rahe hai vah nahin hoti
 In such a situation, democracy would be just a toy in the hands of some people
 desh main agadon kaa hi bolbalaa hota
 However, some aspects of this politics, such as corruption, criminalization, are those who go against this process
 duusari ore jatvaad, apradheekaran or paise ke is khel par thu-thu karne vaale aksar apane chunavi phaayde ke liye isse kahin zyada khatarnaak sampradayik raajnneeti karte dekhe jate hai
 Young voters are not on the lookout for the parties involved in caste politics in Bihar
 wo yuva peedi jo aaj kii takanic se kadamtal karte hue har jagah apana paracham laharaa rakhaa he
 Voyuva generation as identifying good and bad
 wo yuva peedi jo ab world bank kii report pard rahi he
 Today, this young generation is sad that their Bihar with a golden past is shedding tears on their fortunes, sitting 21st in the pace of development
 vahiin jharkhand main niveshak itane lubhaa rahe hai ki wo vikaas kii raftaar main tisare number par seenaa taane khadaa he
 The young voter of Bihar is now raising the question of livelihood by denying caste
 bihar kaa yuva bimaaru rajya kii tohamat se baahar nikalne ke liye aatur he
 It is clear that the mandate of this class will not be on caste
 aise main samajha saktaa he ki bihar kii yuva peedi kis karavat baithne vaali he
 Needless to say that every political upheaval in Bihar has its own importance
 yahaan ke har chunaav main jatvaad ek katu satya he isse aasaani se peechha nahin chhudaaya ja saktaa
 It is to be hoped that in this election there will be neither Rajput, Bhumihar, Yadav nor backward and Dalit
 ye bhi ummid kii jaani chahie ki is chunaav main bade mudde par bihari samaaj apane dhang se hosho-havaas main pratikriya degaa jo jati par katai aadhaarit nahin hoga
 So it remains to be seen that this election of Bihar Assembly has become very important due to many reasons, what picture does it present in its final result? bollywood actress huma kuraishi ne shuukravaar ko apane ghar par ek khaas party kaa aayojan kiya

 Security and intelligence agencies investigating the attack have found clues that jaish-e-mohammed's handlers were connected to the peer-to-peer software service from Adil Ahmed Dar, the terrorist who carried out the attack
 jaish-e-mohammad ke sanchaalkon ne is sarvice kaa istemaal isliye kiya, kyonki isse ve mobile phone servilans ke daayre main aane se batch gaye
 The terrorists had contacted Dar till December 2018 through peay-to-peer Software service-ysms or similar mobile app
 khufia sutron ke haath YSMS massej kii copy mili he
 Intelligence agencies believe that these messages were made after the Pulwama attack
 ek sandesh main likhaa gaya he ki 'jaish kaa mujahid apane makasad main kaamyaab hua' or duusare sandesh main likhaa gaya he, 'bhartiya sainik or darjanon gaadiyaan hamale main khaak ho gayi
 Ultra high radio frequency model is used to send YSMS code messages
 isamen ek radio set ko ek phone se atech kiya jaataa he, jiske andar koi sim card nahin hota he
 a radio set is basically a small transmitter equipped with wi-fi facility
 is vaai-faai se mobile ko conect kiya jaataa he
 The YSMS app has been available in the Dark Web since 2012
 pakistan main maujuud aatanki sanghathanon ne ek nayaa sanskaran bana liya he jo aisi frequency istemaal karata he jo disambar se kisi bhi monitering divaais kii pakad main nahin aayaa he
 An example of peer-to-peer service is the downloading from Torrent
 is dauraan duniya ke kisi bhi hisse main ek computer duusare computaron se internet ke jariye judaa rahata he or is sarvice main aapas main file share karne ke liye kisi central sarwar kii jarurat bhi nahin hoti he
 Because of this it is challenging to rein
 bataa den ki 14 farvari ko jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main hue aatanki hamale main siarpief ke 40 jawan shahid ho gaye the
 Explosives-laden cars were used in the terrorist attack
 isamen savaar jaish ke aatanki adil ahamed daar ne siarpief ke kafile ko nishaanaa banaaya tha or siarpief ke javaanon se bhari ek bas ko uda diya tha
 In February this year, the Central Intelligence Agency Intelligence Bureau sent a note to the Ministry of Home Affairs
 isamen daawa kiya gaya tha ki khud apane desh se khaded die gaye bangladeshi aatanki dhade pashchim bengal main panaah le rahe hai or trinmul congress (tiemasi) ke kai netaa yahaan chhipane main unki madad kar rahe hai
 These were the days before the Lok Sabha elections, so this note did not get much attention
 aise main sipiem kii kendriya samiti ke sadsy or pashchim bengal ke purv mantri gautam deb ne media ke jariye tikhaa hamalaa bol diya
 He alleged that TMC Rajya Sabha member Ahmed Hassan Imran was secretly working for the jamaat-ul-mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB)
 isse pehle 2012 main rajya kii ek khufia report main kaha gaya tha ki imran sampradayik hinsa kii ghatnaon main shaamil rahe hai
 Despite this, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee did not hesitate to nominate him to the Rajya Sabha
 yahi vajah he ki aatankiyon se trinmul ke kathith rishton kaa ek baar phir khulaasa hua to is par kisi ko zyada tajjub nahin hua
 These relations of the Trinamool came into prominence on 2 October when two suspected JMB terrorists were killed in a bomb blast at the residence of its leader Nurul Hasan Chaudhary in Khagragarh in Burdwan district
 lekin is baar fark yah he ki bijepi centre kii satta main he or loksabhaa chunaav main shandaar kamyaabi ke baad uski rajya ikai jabardast utsaah se labarej he
 This is the reason why Mamata Banerjee and her party are now finding it difficult to answer these allegations
 khaskar aise main jab banerjee par pehle se hi ek ke baad ek kai kalyankari kaaryakramon ke jariye musalamaanon kaa tushtikaran karne main koi kasar nahin chhodie ke aarope lagate rahe hai
 Observers believe that all this is being done in West Bengal for the purpose of political polarization on religious grounds
 is dhruvikaran kaa pehla swaad banerjee ne sitambar main chakhaa jab shamik bhattacharya ne bashirhaat upachunaav jeet liya or 15 saalon main rajya vidhansabha main daakhil hone vaale bijepi ke pehle netaa ban gaye
 Three reasons are cited for emerging as an alternative to BJP in remote areas of the state — Banerjee's strong emphasis on welfare measures for Muslims, alleged "bullying and corruption" by Trinamool workers, and bjp's government in Delhi
 rajya kii aabaadi main musalmaan takreeban 30 fisadi hai
 The credit for Trinamool's landslide victory in the 2011 assembly elections is credited to mobilizing large numbers of Muslim votes in their favor
 tab kai muslim dharmaguruon ne khuleam banerjee kaa samarthan kiya tha
 After coming to power he gave the Imams Rs 2,500
 maheenaa bhatta dene kaa or iske baad muajjinon ko bhi 1,500 ru
 Announced monthly payment of Rs
 inase rajya ke khajaane par har saal 84 karod ru
 But before that Calcutta High Court declared them unconstitutional
 shamik bhattacharya kehete hai, “pashchim bengal kii janata ne kabhi bhi dharmik aadhaar par vot nahin diya
 It was Mamata Banerjee who started the politics of dividing the people with her aggressive methods of wooing the Muslims
 lekin mamata kaa mansabu ab log samajhane lage hai, yahaan tak ki ab muslim bhi unka saath chhod rahe hai
 "state BJP president Rahul Sinha claims that many Muslims in Bengal villages are joining the BJP because they have understood that Banerjee is distributing money only for the sake of votes
" bangladeshi seemaa par bashirhaat ke banshazari gaanv kii 20 varshiya naragis sultanaa bangla sahitya kii post graduate chaatra hai
 His story is a unique and accurate example of the changing socio-political fabric in the rural areas of West Bengal
 sultanaa kahati hai ki unhone banerjee ke samarthan se isliye haath khinch liye kyonki “ve vaade to khub karatin hai lekin unamem se puraa ek bhi nahin kiya
 Muslims were merely vote banks for him
 ” sahitya ke saath kanoon kii bhi padhai karne vaali sultanaa sawaal karti hai, “imaamon ko paisa dene kaa kya matlab he? mamata maanakar chalati hai ki imam musalamaanon ke vot unhen dilaa denge
 Apart from sharing a small amount of money, that too on paper, what has he done for us? ”sultana had voted for the Trinamool in 2011, but six months ago she joined the BJP
 ab ve party kii alpsankhyak shakha kii mahasachiv hai
 He hopes that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take tough steps to stop infiltration from Bangladesh
 haalanki kolkata ke bangabasi college main raajnneeti vigyaan ke professor udayan bandyopadhyaay nahin maanate ki bijepi ke muslim samarthan main achaanak koi oochaal aa gaya he
 He says, “it would not be right to say that minority votes are moving away from Trinamool
 aisa bhi hua he ki sattadhari jamaavade ke khilaaf rajnatik pratirodh khadaa karne ke liye musalmaan bijepi ke paale main chale gaye
 Ultimately, it is a question of defending themselves
 ”to bhi rajnatik dalon ke bich badhata dhruvikaran hinsak shakl akhriyaar karata ja rahaa he
 Three weeks after the Burdwan blast on October 27, three people were killed in clashes between Trinamool and BJP supporters in Makhara village in Birbhum district
 ek police afasar ke upar desi bam phenkaa gaya, jisamen vah ghayal ho gaya
 16 buckets full of bomb-making items were recovered from a primary health center
 gaanv vaale or police haalanki kah rahe hai ki in bamon kaa bardwan kii ghatana se koi sambandh nahin; ye bam to pashchim bengal kii hinsak rajnatik samskruti kaa hi ek hissaa hai
 (chief Minister Mamata Banerjee joining Iftar in Kolkata) BJP is planning to make infiltration from Bangladesh a big election issue
 vahiin banerjee ne is maamle main jaan-boojhkar chuppi odh rakhi he
 Opponents say this is their more Muslim vote-grabbing strategy
 is tarah banerjee ne apana rukh bilkul palat liya haih 2005 main unhone loksabhaa main “gaiyrkanoonee bangladeshi ghuspaithiyon” kaa vishay uthaane se roke jane par spikar kii kursi par kaagaj phenkakar apana virodh jataayaa tha
 On 3 November, Mamata Banerjee instructed her party workers to go door-to-door to counter the "malicious propaganda campaign" against the Trinamool
 unhone sharada chitfund ghotaale or saath hi aatanki samoohon ke saath kathith rishton par party ke rukh ko samajhane ke liye ek pustika chhapane kaa bhi hukum diya he
 Rahul Banerjee, a student at Vishwabharati University, Shanti Niketan, says, “mamta has left us hopeless
 lagaataar ghuspaith kii vajah se pashchim bengal kii aabaadi main gupachup badlaav aa rahaa he
 But our Chief Minister is trying to please the vote bank which was made by foreigners
 haalanki main ummid karata hum ki pradhanmantri modi ghuspaithiyon ko nikaal baahar karne ke apane vaade ko puraa karenge
 Banerjee, who has been surrounded all around, is now focused on uniting her party
 3 november ko ek baithak main unhone dilachasp palati khai or trinmul ke purv rashtriya sachiv or pramukh chunaav prabandhak mukul roy tathaa apane aghoshit number tu madan mitra ke saath ekajutata kaa izhaar kiya
 The names of these two veteran leaders had come up in the investigation of the Saradha chit fund scam and hence Mamata Banerjee had sidelined them
 lekin paryvekshak kehete hai ki unhen darkinar karne kii ek vajah party main mamata ke bhattije abhishek banerjee kaa badhata prabhaav bhi tha
 Critics of the TMC supremo say that they had fought a long battle against the Left Front and promised to bring change in the state
 lekin unke satta main aane ke baad ekmaatr parivartan logon ko rang main dikhaai diya he—jo laal se ab haraa ho gaya he
 Bandyopadhyay says, "the Trinamool government has neither been able to map the development nor can it focus on reforms in education, solid industrial policy and agriculture
" sarkaar ko ab chahie ki vah chote-mote vivaadon se pallaa jhadakar badi baton par jor de
 Not only this, Mamata Banerjee will now have to fight another battle — she will have to gear up to stop the saffron brigade's aggressive ascent in West Bengal

 In this attack, some flaws related to Punjab Police personnel were also revealed

 jis prakaar kii banduukon ke chalane kii awaajen sunai de rahi thim, isse saaf jaahir ho rahaa tha ki aatanki puri taiyaari ke saath aae hai or aadhunik hathiyaaron ke saath las hai
 Around 5 in the evening
 30 baje jaise hi oparation ko puraa ghoshit kiya gaya vaise hi dinanagar police stesan ke javaanon ne vande maataram ke naare lagaae
 By then, all the attackers had been shot dead
 is samay tak yah report kiya gaya tha ki aatankiyon ne sawari se bhari ek bas par andhadhundh firing kii phir ek maaruti 800 car ko lekar police stesan pahunche or kaha gaya ki hamale main aath logon kii maut ho chuki he
 As soon as the operation was completed, a few things related to the case appeared to be noticeable
 jaise ki hamalavar aatankiyon ke haath main jahaan eke 47 riflein thi vahiin punjab police ke javaanon ke haath main puraani ho chukin esaelaar rifles
 On the other hand it was also seen that the policemen did not have any bulletproof vest
 yah police force punjab police kii swat team thi
 The surprising thing was that they had knee pads but no helmets
 hamale ke footage dekhne se yah bhi abhas hua ki police waalon ke paas is prakaar ke hamale ke dauraan 'kaise nipta jaae', isaki uchit training nahin thi
 The policemen were not aware of how the grenade was to be thrown
 haasyaaspad he, magar yah ek kadavi sachai dekhi gai ki grenade hamale ke baad police vaale peeche bhaage or apane ko bachaane ke liye cover dhund rahe the
 It was also observed that a heavy cop tried to flee the spot and his rifle was hanging behind
 logon kii suraksha kaa kya haal rahaa iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki tamashbin ghatnasthal ke kaaphi kareeb pahunch gaye the or aisa laga jaise koi tamaasha dekh rahe hon
 The comments subah yah dekha gaya ki bhartiya sena ke special forces ke jawan, jo kaaphi trend the, behatar hathiyaaron se las the, maukey par pahunch gaye the, lekin kaha ja rahaa he ki punjab police ne saaf kar diya tha ki vah is karrwai kii aguwai karegi
 Surprisingly, the Special Forces personnel were engaged in cordoning the area and the police continued in action
 aamtaur par hota yah he ki sena aisi karrwai ko anjaam detii he or police ke jawan ilaake kii gheraabandi karte hai
 It is a fact that all the terrorists were killed and the operation was successful, but once again it was in front of the level of training of our police force and how modern their weapons are

 jaise hi oparation puraa hua, maamle se judi kuch baaten gaur karne yogya dikhaai deen
 For example, while the AK 47 rifles were in the hands of the attacking terrorists, the old SLR rifles in the hands of Punjab Police personnel
 duusari ore yah bhi dekha gaya ki police waalon ke paas koi bhi bulatopruf jacket nahin tha
 This police force was the swat team of Punjab Police
 aashcharya kii baat yah thi unke paas ghutane ke pad the lekin koi helmet nahin tha
 Watching the footage of the attack also revealed that the policemen did not have proper training on how to deal with such an attack
 yah dekha gaya ki grenade kaise phenkaa janaa he, police waalon ko jaankaree nahin thi
 Ridiculous, but it was seen the bitter truth that after the grenade attack, the policemen ran behind and were looking for cover to protect themselves
 yah bhi dekha gaya ki ek baari pulisavaale ne maukey se bhaagane kii koshish kii or uski rifl peeche latak rahi thi
 The condition of the safety of the people can be gauged from the fact that the spectacle had reached very close to the scene and it felt as if some were watching the spectacle
 tippaniyan It was seen in the morning that the soldiers of the Special Forces of the Indian Army, who were quite trendy, armed with better weapons, reached the spot, but it is being said that the Punjab Police had made it clear that it would lead this action
 
 aashcharya kii baat yah thi ki special forces ke javaanon ko ilaake ko cordan karne ke kaam main laga diya gaya or police karrwai main lagi rahi
 It is usually that the army executes such action and police personnel cordon the area
 yah hakeekat he ki sabhi aatankwaadiyon ko maar giraaya gaya or oparation kaamyaab rahaa, lekin ek baar phir yah saamne tha ki hamaari police force kii training kis str kii he or unke hathiyaar kitne aadhunik hai
 On the other hand it was also seen that the policemen did not have any bulletproof vest
 yah police force punjab police kii swat team thi

" ham camere ko shayankaksh se lekar siver, nahar, hammam, bas, picnic sthal tak le jaaenge or ise kamare main lage pankhe main bhi lagaayenge, yahaan tak ki handbag, mekassop vine yaa restaraan tak main chhipaakar rakhaa jayega
 Artists rotate the camera
 ''valyorism (paroksh younachaar) or ekjabishanism (ang pradarshan) kii pravriti, aisa lagata he ki bharat main sweekaaryata hasil karti ja rahi he
 a brutal kind of yearning, however, has covered the aura of the liberated and celebratory variety arising out of this erotic excess and success
 darasal yah hakeekat he ki 21veen sadi kaa bharat isi gathjod kaa shikaar ho gaya haih ham teji se aa rahi nae or anuthe tarah kii us media praudyogiki ke peeche bhaag rahe hai jisane duniya ko hamaari hatheli par laakar rakh diya he
 Literally we are surrounded by both infinite possibilities and imminent danger of lifestyle choices as they are said to be available in media sites around the clock
 yadi paroksh younachaar kii tripti kaa hamaara purana chalan jahaan khidakiyon kii daraar se prerit tha jisamen jatil samay, anulalanghaneey niztaa or kaamuk sukh ke liye nitant vyaktigat antarangta jaisi chijen ahm hoti thim, to ab ham spasht rup se ekadam nae kism ke daravaaje ke saamne khadey hai jisamen laga kii-hole hamen puure vistaar ke saath vah dikhaa saktaa he jisase ham hairat main pad jaaen
 And now this indirect sex philosophy is ready for display
 paroksh younachaar dekhne kii pravriti yaa nayansukh ko yon vikaar ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he jisamen koi vyakti antanirhit yaa prakat rup main yon gatividhiyon main lipt kisi anya vyakti ko gupachup tareeke se dekhakar yon uttejnaa, anand or / yaa santushti praapt karata he jabaki ang pradarshan iske ulat, jisamen yon gatividhiyon main lipt vyakti ko use dekhe jane se anand or santushti milti he, vah bhi tab jab vah kaam rasik kii maujuudagi se bekhbar hone kaa chal kar rahaa ho
 Capturing a person's sexual 'activity' on camera and then sharing it with friends or strangers, as seen in the MMS scandal, involves many people ranging from innocent to plotting
 or gyaan or sahmati kii yah uljhan tay kar rahe hai ki kaise niztaa ke adhikaar, sensorship or kisi vayask ke adhikaar, sahmati se hone vaali yon gatividhi jaise kaarak is tarah ke jatil mail-milaap main ulajhate ja rahe hai
 While in Britain and Canada, the tendency to view sex acts indirectly is a crime, in India it is not prohibited, while the woman suffering from it can be protected under the Indian Penal Act
 dhara 509 ke tahat koi bhi duraachaar yaa kahen 'kisi mahila ke sheel kaa apmaan' or uski 'niztaa' kaa 'atikaraman' dandaneey he or 2006 ke soochna praudyogiki (sanshodhan) adhinium main iskaa vistaar kar vishesh rup se aisi chhaviyon ke prasaaran jo ki 'chape hue rup main yaa electronic form main' uski niztaa kaa ulanghan karata ho, ko sajaa or jurmaane ke rup main dandaneey banaaya gaya he
 Electronic form, rather than printed, has created both enjoyment and agony for our shared existence and there are no more entrenched paths in this 'paradise' than in the sexual landscape
 aaj kisi anya vyakti kii gupt yon gatividhiyon se sambandhit har kalpana jise koi lucchhip kar dekhnaa chaahe, vah aaj hamaare praudyogiki se bharpoor lekin saaf taur par asantusht, vaishvik astitv main mahaj ek sparsh (batan) jitani dur he
 So are we a whispering distance from a new disease of profusion of indirect sex? Does the man or woman enjoying indirect sex acts know that he is sharing it with millions of other strangers at the same time or Then, is there any thrill left in this indirect pleasure of Ratikrida, about whom others should be told? Has the secretive erotic shadows confined on the screens of cell phones, laptops, desktops, televisions and multiplexes reduced the sensation of sexuality or have we experienced our experiences growing up in a world full of sexuality We have to redefine? Our ultimate pleasure associated with indirect sex acts seems to exist in various forms of 'real' and 'imaginal' Is there a hole lies not in technology but in the peep and Technology is also helping it
 or sambhawatah aisa isliye he kyonki isaki vaidhata ko praudyogiki vahan kar paa rahi he
 The emergence of gummies such as 'slum Voyorism' (for example, on the lines of Slumdog Millionaire) and Kam Rasik Tourist are also underlining the change in which our understanding of Kam Rasik is changing
 ham samajhate the ki kaam rasik yani vah jiskaa kaamuk sukh dekhne ke tilism main chipa hota he
 But now indirect sex, it seems that the pleasure of seeing the unknown world has been crossed, its sensation has turned into a sexual disorder rather than its essential erotic element
 hairat ho sakati he ki kya yah kaamuk vikaar ke bare main badalte vichaar, sab chalata he jaisi beficri se hi utpann hua he yaa phir yah vijual anand ke teji se badhate overdoj kaa asar he, aisi chhaviyaan banane vaale / praapt karne vaale / prasaarit karne vaale tak aasaan pahunch or nijee jindagiyon ko saarvajanik karne kii dabi ichha sibar spes main soshal netwarking kii mahamari ke rup main fail rahi he? sex survey 2009 main valyorism / ekjabishanism se jude sawaal camere ke prati hamaari isaki deewangi or hamaari yon kalpanaaon main isaki gahari najar ko pradarshit karte hai
 In fact, we can understand the voyeurism of our era by the transformation of the 18th century sociologist Jeremy Bentham's detention house in Foucault whose enclosed, isolated prisoners within the enclosure we can see but are unaware of, all-around surrounded But fully visible, in which the center (the viewer) has the right to see, but not to see itself
 aisi vyavasthit or takneekee kism kii taakazank ko ab paroksh younachaar ke anubhav main aanandadaayak kaha ja saktaa he
 The questions in the first set of this section attempt to understand the concept associated with MMS, if we believe our multi-media, which has exposed the tendency of indirect sex acts clandestinely to our national psyche
 is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki video ricarding kii mahamari ke liye camere vaale mobile phone hi jimmedaar hai
 12 per cent of the men surveyed (the highest in Ludhiana and Bangalore) and 4 per cent of the women (highest in Mumbai) admitted that they thought of capturing their sexual activities on camera for mms
 anumaan he ki ms deshbhar main yon gatividhi ke sabase uttejk rup main ubhara he, is survey se yah baat bhi saamne ai he ki ms sex ke bare main avivaahit log shaayad hi kalpana karte hai
 That is, it is a challenge to the common belief that according to this the concept of MMS sex has gained tremendous penetration among the youth
 ghoomte hue camere kii ankhen aane vaali peedi ke liye kishor vay ladke-ladakiyon ke milane vaali jagahon ke bajaae paripakv vivaahiton ke shayankaksh kii antarang gatividhiyon ko kahin adhik kaid kar rahi hai
 41 per cent of women who have imagined MMS sex and 44 per cent of men who have done so admit that they put their fantasies on a video screen, with 56 per cent of men being middle class
 21veen sadi kii upabhoktavaadi aadhuniktaa main jisamen camere vaala mobile phone sambhawatah sabase chamakdaar pratik he or yah bharat ke vrihat madhyam varg ke bich prachhann rup se or kahin adhik chaalaaki se jagah banaata ja rahaa he, so isse hairat nahin hoti
 Then it also shows that almost all the men involved in the survey had their own mobile phones
 hairat nahin hoti ki ms sex main lipt rahi aadhe se adhik mahilaon or 80 fisadi purushon ne isaki recording kaa doston or anya logon ke saath saajha kiya or phir ise internet main oplod bhi kar diya
 "" It can be inferred that a person's desire to capture intimate video moments in video is in fact linked to the longing of the performer who wants these images to be taken out of the boundary where it is Was imprisoned
 survey main shaamil 75 fisadi purushon kii internet tak pahunch he
 Very few women, about eight percent and 17 percent of men, claimed to have seen MMS from friends and relatives
 mumbai, dilli, ludhiana or ahmedabad kii mahilaayein is maamle main sabase aage thim or purushon ke maamle main ludhiana sabase aage tha
 The city's profile has little to do with Ludhiana being at the forefront of this section of the survey
 ekjabishanism or valyorism kii pravriti jaruri nahin ki kisi vyakti main ek saath ho, aisa lagata he ki jisamen is tarah kii koi ek pravriti ho to usamen duusari pravriti bhi hogi
 Among men in Ludhiana, it is worth noting: the most men who imagined MMS sex were from Ludhiana; One out of every five claimed that they watched MMS sex videos of their friends / relatives but only a few of them created their own MMS; Most (80 per cent) of those who did so shared their video with others and also put it on the Internet
 taakazank karne waalon main bhi ludhiana sabase aage tha, 90 fisadi paroksh younachaar or ang pradarshan se hone vaali uttejnaa ke bare main kalpana karte hai
 We must remember that such figures in Ludhiana will have a significant effect on the average to be extracted in general
 vibhinn shaharon main dusron ke dwaara gupt tareeke se dekhe jane yaa phir khud ko dekhe jane se waakif hone kii vajah se kaamuk hone kii kalpana karne ke bare main mahilaon or purushon main kaaphi antar dekha gaya
 a large number of men (70 per cent) felt aroused when women saw them during the Rati game
 dakshin is maamle main aage haih bangaloru main takreeban sabhi purush mahila darshakon yaa mahila kaam rasik ke liye rati krida karne kii sambhaavna se uttejit hote hai
 30 percent of the women surveyed are excited by work habits, whether it is male or female, it does not matter
 is survey ne khulaasa kiya ki paroksh younachaar yaa / or ang pradarshan kii kalpana mahilaon ke bajaae purush adhik karte hai
 But anyone can be surprised to see the sexual preferences of women and men involved in the survey
 in aankadon se kya koi yah nishkarsh nikaal saktaa he ki 2009 main yon vyavhaar ke rup main valyorism or / yaa ekjabishanism ne puure bharat ke mahanagaron or chote shaharon main prachand rup se jagah bana lee? aisa lagata to nahin
 What is really worth noting is that India - all kinds of cities - big and small - has started thinking seriously about sexual behavior that is traditionally considered inequitable and even realizing such fantasies
 
 or upabhoktavaadi vaishvik aadhuniktaa main chote se video recording upkaran ke saath bhavishya kii kalpana kii udaan bharne ko bhi taiyaar he
