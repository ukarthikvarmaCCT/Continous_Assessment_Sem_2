 par yah sawaal tabhi kyon uthta he jab koi film nahin chal paati he
 Why does it not arise when it is gone? sameekshak sirf ek film nahin dekhtaa he
 He reviews a film from his worldly experience of many earlier films
 isliye uske hone ko kaarij bhi nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki har samiksha ek jaisi nahin hoti or na honi chahie
 The myths created by cinema and politics about Bombay are yet to be brought to the surface of authentic history
 agar main kahuun ki bombai kii jad main afim dabaa he to is ek pankti ko samajhane ke liye bombai ke itihaas par likhi anek kitabon ke bich lautnaa padegaa
 a visit to Bombay before Mumbai is not a visit to equal opportunities and democratic rights
 isaki yatra ek nexs kii yatra he jo aaj mukammal ho gai he
 Which is hidden in the name-anonymous relationships of politics, media, real estate, police and cinema
 bombai par qabze kii ladaai kaa nerrative aaj bhi chaalu he
 This city of Bombay is a city of accidents
 jab andhera hota he ek chor nikalataa he aadhi raat ke baad
 There are many songs that keep whitening the black truth of Bombay being Bombay
 bombai kaa ek itihaas in filmon or gaanon main darj he
 Anurag Kashyap has made a great film
 'bombai velvet' kii kahani ab bombai kii nahin rahi
 Greater Noida, Noida, Gurgaon Do not know where it has spread
 middle class real estate se sirf sapana karidata he par real estate sapane par nahin saude kii hakeekat par khadaa he
 Bombay Velvet is the story before Bombay became a metropolis
 iske mahanagar banane ke nexs main funs kar balraj maaraa jaataa he
 Is the legend of Cricket Control of India not continuing even today? jo kal tha wo aaj bhi he
 i also started seeing Bombay Velvet in the noise of Smart City
 is film kaa ek ek frem yaadgaar he
 The praise of Ranbir Kapoor's performance will be less
 ye ranbir kii sabase acchhee film he
 Anushka Sharma's acting is as authentic as it has become a topic of discussion due to her recent controversies
 film kaa set, shades, dizine, kapade sab pramanik tareeke se banaae gaye hai
 Amitabh Bhattacharya's lyrics are amazing
 yah film na to slo he or na isamen imoshan kii kami he
 For what is in this film must be seen
 darshak ko bhi nayaa dekhnaa chahie
 It is not the film that should be left out to a star found in the review, to dismiss it
 aisi hi pratikriya 'gangs of vasepur' ke vakt dekhi thi jo hamaare samay kii ek mahaan film he
 Heard that Anurag Kashyap is sad
 paris ja rahe hai
 i do not understand when Purbia will stop being emotional but if it is not emotional then Purbia will also not be there
 aap in panktiyon ko padhate hue hans sakate hai par raaj sahab or yash ji apane man kii filmein isiliye bana paae kyonki ve apane punjabipan ko kabhi nahin chhod paye
 Not Raj Kapoor or Yash Chopra, i only say Yash ji, only then it seems that i have said something in his pride
 tippaniyan Anurag Kashyap, Dibakar Banerjee, Shoojit Sarkar are directors on their own
 ek nirdeshak or filmkaar main tab fark samaj main aayaa jab 'gangs of vasepur' dekhi thi
 When i saw 'paan Singh Tomar', it was not Anurag's film
 kahani sab likhte hai par sahityakar sab nahin hote
 For many people, Anurag can be a failed director on many parameters of success, but one cannot dismiss him as a filmmaker
 isliye anuraag kii sari filmein dekhtaa hum
 What does it matter if a director leaves Mumbai and moves to Paris
 use jane dijiye
 In Paris too, he will get the story of Bombay Velvet
 mahanagaron kaa itihaas hi yahi he
 Do not consider my writing as a review nor change your intention of not watching the film after reading it
 aap ek acchhee film nahin dekhenge to kuch nahin hoga
 We do not watch many good films
 vaise somvaar dopaher jab yah film dekh rahaa tha tab haul main logon kii sankhya dekh hairaani hui
 i thought that i would be the only one watching
 shaayad ab bhi log samiksha padhe bina bhi filmein dekh rahe hai
 For example, when a scene suddenly becomes sixties in a film, an old song rings in some context
 sirf nostaljia ke ubhaar ke liye nahin balki us yatra ko bataane ke liye jo aaj tak jari he
 'bombay Belvette' is the cinema of Bombay and Bombay cinema
 pichley ravivaar hi is film ko dekhne niklaa tha magar fasebuk or twitor par chhitraye samiksha ke asar main iraadaa badal diya
 i returned from the cinema hall
 maine koi samiksha nahin padhi kyonki main samiksha padhakar cinema nahin dekhtaa lekin sheershak se laga ki dekhnaa manaa ho gaya he
 When i started watching movies in Patna, i used to imagine and see the scene of the film by looking at the passport size photo inside the noticeboard outside the hall
 trailor, poster or film dekhakar laute logon kii charchaaon kaa hi zyada asar rahaa
 By the time he came to Delhi, many people have become critics and his impact on our non-viewing continues even today
 main bhi blog par likhte likhte sameekshak tip ban gaya
 But i am not film kii samiksha ek peshewar kaam he
 The reviewer watches the films, wins them but the reviewers have been made cinema viewing guides
 saare darshakon ke badale koi ek sameekshak darshak kaise ban jaataa he
 But why this question arises only when no film is able to play
 tab kyon nahin uthta he jab chal jaati he
 The reviewer does not watch just one film
 wo ek film kii pehle kii kai filmon ke apane sansaarik anubhav se samiksha karata he
 Therefore, its existence cannot be dismissed because not every review is and should not be the same
 bombai ko lekar cinema or raajnneeti ne jo myth gadhe hai unhen pramanik itihaas kii dharaatal par laayaa janaa baaki he
 If i say that opium is suppressed at the root of Bombay, then to understand this one line, one has to return between many books written on the history of Bombay
 mumbai se pehle bombai kii yatra samaan avasaron or loktantric adhikaron kii yatra nahin he
 Its journey is the journey of a Nexus which has become complete today
 jo raajnneeti, media, real estate, police or cinema ke naam-anaam rishton main chhipi he
 The Narrative of the Battle of the Kabbah at Bombay is still on
 ye bombai shahar haadason kaa shahar he
 When it is dark, a thief comes out after midnight
 aise anek gane hai jo bombai ke bombai hone ke kaale sach ko safed karte rahete hai
 a history of Bombay is recorded in these films and songs
 anuraag kashyap ne ek behtareen film banaai he
 The story of 'bombay Velvet' is no longer Bombay
 greater noida, noida, gudgaanv na jane kahaan kahaan fail gai he
 The middle class buys only Sapna from real estate, but real estate is not the dream but the reality of the deal
 bombai ke mahanagar hone se pehle kii kahani he bombai velvet
 Balraj is killed by being trapped in the nexus of becoming its metropolis
 cricket control of india kii katha kya aaj bhi jari nahin he
 What was yesterday is still today
 main bombai velvet ko smart city ke shor main bhi dekhne laga
 Each frame of this film is memorable
 ranbir kapur kii adaakaari kii jitani taareef kii jaae wo kam hogi
 This is Ranbir's best film
 anoushka sharma kaa abhinay jitna pramanik laga he wo unke tazaa vivaadon ke kaaran charchaa kaa shikaar ho gaya
 The film sets, shades, designs, fabrics are all authentically made
 amitabh bhattacharya ke geet kamaal ke hai
 The film is neither slow nor lacks emotion
 is film main jo he uske liye dekha janaa chahie
 The viewer should also see new
 dekhakar kaarij karne ke liye sahi par ye wo film nahin he jise samiksha main mili ek star ko dekh chhod diya janaa chahie
 Similar reaction was seen during 'gangs of Wasseypur', which is a great film of our times
 suna he anuraag kashyap dukhi hai
 Going to paris purbia kab imotional hona chhodega samaj nahin aata lekin wo imotional nahin rahegaa to phir purbia bhi nahin rahegaa
 You can laugh while reading these lines, but Raj Saheb and Yash Ji were able to make films of their mind because they could never give up their Punjabi
 raaj kapur yaa yash chopra nahin main yash ji hi kahata hum tabhi lagata he ki maine unki shaan main kuch kaha he
 The comments anuraag kashyap, dibaakar banerjee, shoojit sarkaar apane dam par khadey hone vaale nirdeshak hai
 The difference between a director and a filmmaker made sense when i saw 'gangs of Wasseypur'
 jab 'paan singh tomars' dekhi thi, bhale wo anuraag kii film nahin thi
 Everyone writes a story, but not everyone is a writer
 kai logon ke liye safalataa ke kai maanakon par anuraag asafal nirdeshak ho sakate hai magar ek filmkaar ke rup main koi kaarij nahin kar saktaa
 That's why i watch all of Anurag's films
 kya fark padataa he ek nirdeshak mumbai chhod paris chalaa jaae
 Let it go paris main bhi use bombai velvet kii hi kahani milegi
 This is the history of metros
 mere likhe ko samiksha na samajhen or na hi padhane ke baad film na dekhne kaa apana iraadaa badalen
 If you do not watch a good film, nothing will happen
 ham bahut si acchhee filmein nahin dekhte hai
 By the way, while watching the film on Monday afternoon, the number of people in the hall was surprised
 mujhe to laga ki main hi akelaa dekh rahaa hounga
 Perhaps people are still watching movies without reading reviews
 pichley ravivaar hi is film ko dekhne niklaa tha magar fasebuk or twitor par chhitraye samiksha ke asar main iraadaa badal diya

 i do not understand when Purbia will stop being emotional but if it is not emotional then Purbia will also not be there
 aap in panktiyon ko padhate hue hans sakate hai par raaj sahab or yash ji apane man kii filmein isiliye bana paae kyonki ve apane punjabipan ko kabhi nahin chhod paye
 Not Raj Kapoor or Yash Chopra, i only say Yash ji, only then it seems that i have said something in his pride

 com / fyvdlmaa3q jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main hue aatanki hamale ke baad pakistan puri tarah se ghir gaya he
 jaish-e-mohammed is responsible for the Pulwama attack, which is known on Pakistan's land
 jiske baad se hi bharat ne pakistan par dabaav banaaya or duniyabar main use gherne kii koshish kii jiskaa asar dikh rahaa he
 Pakistan has banned organizations like jaish-e-mohammed, lashkar-e-taiba, jamaat-ud-dawa
 haalanki, pakistan kii fitrat isamen saaf nahin dikh rahi he kyonki beete do dashak main aise kai maukey aae hai jab usne in sanghathanon par bain lagaaya he
 The question is once again whether this is just a show of action
 karrwai yaa sirf dikhaava?pulavama aatanki hamale ke taar pakistan se hi jude hai is mudde ko bharat ne antarrashtriya patal par sabit kar diya tha
 After which many countries of the world asked Pakistan to take action against terrorist organizations, there was pressure on not only the country but also the UN, FATF, UNSC
 yahi vajah he ki usne turant ection liya or 44 sanghathanon par bain lagaaya or kuch ko hiraasat main bhi liya
 However, there is no evidence that this action of Pakistan should be considered concrete
 kyonki pakistan ke hi kai log soshal media par likh rahe hai ki ham is tarah ke bain-karrwai pehle bhi dekh chuke hai
 Significantly, despite the terrorist attack in the US, Mumbai attack, Pakistan had banned some such terrorist organizations many times
 kyon nahin hota pakistan par vishwaas?darasal, pakistan kaa itihaas hi aisa hi ki us par vishwaas nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Pakistan has previously banned Hafiz Saeed's organization but Hafiz has contested the general election there, rallies daily and spews poison against Hindustan
 naa sirf hafiz balki pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad kai tivi intervyuu main ye kabool chuke hai ki jaish-e-mohammad kaa sargana moulana masood ajahar pakistan main hi he
 In an interview, he was defending Jaish, saying that Jaish has not taken responsibility for Pulwama, it is just an illusion
 kyon pakistan ko lenaa padaa is tarah kaa ection?darasal, is karrwai ke peeche pakistan kii kai tarah kii majaburiyaan hai

 For married life to be more pleasant and sweet, it is important that special things are taken care of
 kuch choti, par behad kaam kii baton ke jariye rishte main aasaani se mithaas gholi ja sakati he
 Here are some tips, which can make married life more enjoyable
 1
 Generally, men are quick to have sex
 yah katai jaruri nahin he ki mahila har vakt shaareerik sambandh banane ke liye taiyaar hi ho
 In such a situation, it is very important to get the mood of the other
 agar donon main se koi bhi iske liye 'naa' kahe, to ise kisi or vakt ke liye taal dena chahie
 2
 shaareerik sambandh ke liye aksar purush hi pahal karte hai
 But sometimes women should also take this initiative
 isse ekresata dur hoti he or romaanch barkaraar rahata he
 3
 sambandh banane ke dauraan apane partner ke saamne khush dikhne kii koshish karen
 Sometimes acting happy seems to be really beneficial
 4
 It has also been observed that after satisfaction, men go straight to sleep regardless of their partner
 aisa thik nahin he
 It is very important to take care of yourself
 5
 Do not mention those things in bed, which cause unnecessary mental stress
 saare tanaav chhodkar hi bedroom main jane kaa niyam bana len
 6
 rishte main ek-duusare par shaq-subahaa ke liye koi jagah nahin chhodani chahie
 Whenever your partner feels something unusual, discuss it openly with each other
 7
 Marital life is not just about sex
 ek-duusare ko sachcha pyaar dekar sambandh ko or bhi zyada majboot banaaya ja saktaa he

 neshnal herald maamle main patiala house court se congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ko raahat di gai he
 The court has dismissed the petition of Subramanian Swamy
 court ne saath hi kaha he ki swami ko congress or AGL kii balance shit or iskar sambandhi dastavej nahin milenge
 Significantly, in the National Herald case, an important decision was to be given to the Patiala House Court regarding Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi
 court ko yah tay karnaa tha ki bijepi saansad subramanyam swami ko congress party kii 2010-11 kii balance shit, iskar ritern or associat jarnal limited AJL ke bhi vittiya dastavej bataur subut die jaaen yaa nahin
 In fact, on 12 July, the Delhi High Court overturned the decision of the Patiala House Court, giving a big relief to Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 gauratlab he ki trial court ne unako congress or associat jarnal limited kii inakam tex balance seat or mantralayon ke kagajaat saunpane kaa aadesh diya tha
 Rahul Gandhi targets PM Modi, the money that the poor have is not black money hoicourt ne apane aadesh main kaha tha ki CRPC ke section 91 ke tahat koi bhi order dene se pehle aaropee paksh ko suna janaa jaruri he, jo is maamle main nahin kiya gaya
 The court said that Subramanian Swamy did not apply the application in a serious manner in this case and in the same manner the court (patiala Court) gave orders on it
 swami na to gavaahon kii list ke saath in kagajaton ko jod paae or na hi yah bataa paae ki trial main in kagajaton kii kya ahmayit he
 On March 11, the Patiala House Court of Delhi accepted the demand of BJP leader Subramanian Swamy in the National Herald case, in which the Indian National Congress (INC) and Associated General Pvt
 li
 (AJL) was sought to summon some papers related to the financial information
 court ne sabhi sambandhit vibhaagon ko aadesh jari kiya tha ki vah sambandhit dastavejon kii prati subramanyam swami ko den
 In the case, Congress President Sonia Gandhi, her son Rahul Gandhi, besides Congress leaders Moti Lal Vora, Oscar Fernandes, Suman Dubey, Sam Pitroda are accused
 mahanagar dandadhikari lavalin ne subramanyam swami kii yachika par donon pakshon kii taraf se daleelein puri hone ke baad us par apana aadesh surakshit rakhane kaa faisla sunaaya
 The comments gandhi parivaar kii taraf se daleel di gai thi ki unhen bevajaah pratadit karne ke makasad se adaalat ke samaksh yah yachika lagaai gai he
 The documents that Swamy is demanding are confidential documents of Congress Party and AJL
 yah dastavej swami ko nahin die jane chahie
 Swamy said that under the conspiracy, all the accused formed a company called Young India and took possession of the publisher Associated Journals Limited (AJL) of the National Herald newspaper, which led to the possession of property worth about 90 crore rupees of Young India
 Has been found
 gauratlab he ki neshnal herald maamle main congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ko lekar patiala house court ko ahm faisla sunaanaa tha
 The court had to decide whether to provide BJP MP Subramanian Swamy as proof of the Congress Party's 2010-11 balance sheet, income tax returns and also financial documents of Associate Journal Limited AJL
 darasal, 12 july ko dilli hoicourt ne patiala house court ke faisle ko palatate hue congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ko badi raahat di thi
 Significantly, the trial court ordered him to hand over the income tax balance seat of Congress and Associate Journal Limited and papers of the ministries
 rahul gandhi ne saadhaa piem modi par nishaanaa, garibon ke paas jo paisa he vah kalaadhan nahin he The High Court said in its order that under Section 91 of the CRPC, it is necessary to hear the accused party before placing any order, which was not done in this case
 court ne kaha ki is maamle main subramanyam swami ne gambhir tareeke se aavedan nahin lagaaya or usee tareeke se us par court (patiala court) ne aadesh de die
 The Swami was neither able to associate these documents with the list of witnesses nor could he explain what was the significance of these documents in the trial
 dilli kii patiala house court ne 11 march ko neshnal herald maamle main bhaajapa netaa subramanyam swami kii us maang ko sweekaar kar liya tha, jisamen indian neshnal congress (aiensi) or assocatid general pra
 Ltd
 (ageel) kii vittiya jaankaree se jude kuch kagajaat saman karne kii maang kii gai thi
 The court had issued an order to all concerned departments to give a copy of the relevant documents to the Subramanian owner
 cese main congress adhyaksha sonia gandhi, unke putr rahul gandhi ke alaava congress netaa moti laal vora, auskar furnandis, suman dube, sam pitroda aaropee hai
 Metropolitan Magistrate Lavalin ruled Subramaniam Swamy's plea on the plea of the two sides to secure his order after the arguments were completed
 tippaniyan It was argued on behalf of Gandhi family that this petition has been filed before the court for the purpose of harassing them unnecessarily

 In fact, on 12 July, the Delhi High Court overturned the decision of the Patiala House Court, giving a big relief to Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul Gandhi

 court ne kaha ki is maamle main subramanyam swami ne gambhir tareeke se aavedan nahin lagaaya or usee tareeke se us par court (patiala court) ne aadesh de die

 Internet and social networks have grown in India with changing times
 yakeenan isse bhartiya yugers kii pahunche desh se aage videshon tak faili he, lekin iskaa ek paksh yah bhi he hamaare desh main internet privesi ko lekar breficri kaa alam sabase adhik he
 According to a survey report released by EMC India, 61% of Indian users do not value their privacy while working on the Internet
 online privesi par aadhaarit is global survey main 15 deshon ke 15 hajaar yugers ko shaamil kiya gaya
 But the results from the survey are shocking for India
 report ke mutabik 77 fisadi bhartiya yugers password yaa apni nijee jaankaree share karne main sambandhit website or uski policy par aasaani se bharosa kar lete hai
 What is the reason for the decrease in privacy? According to the report, Internet users usually need everything in the name of convenience and for this they put their privacy at stake
 61 fisadi bhartiya yujar apni privesi ko daanv par lagane ke liye taiyaar rahete hai
 However, the trend of women is much better than men
 43 fisadi purush yujar ke mukaable 59 fisadi mahila yujar privesi ko mahatv detii hai or jaankaree saajha karne se bachati hai
 Chairman of EMC Corporation (india and SAARC) Rajesha Jaane says, 'india is new in the world of Internet
 har koi isse jud rahaa he isliye yahaan retail or i-commers website se kharidari kaa chalan or iske liye janakri share kane kaa lalak badha he
 But this is a matter of concern
 'jaanate hai, lekin kuch nahin kartereport ke mutabik 64 fisadi bhartiya yujar ne kai baar password hack se lekar data chori kaa saamana kiya he
 But despite this no action was taken
 iemasi report ke anusaar, 41 fisadi bhartiya niyamit taur par apana password nahin badalte hai
 28 percent use mobiles without a password
 21 fisadi privesi policy nahin padhate
 21 percent do not change their privacy settings on the website
 51 fisadi yah maanate hai ki unki privesi ghati he
 How to save your privacy service, EMC India has given many suggestions to internet users to maintain privacy
 iske mutabik-1) alag-alag acount ke liye ek hi password kaa istemaal na karen
 Change passwords regularly 2) jahaan opshan ho vahaan email yaa online acount ke liye multi factor othentication kaa prayog karen
 3) Do not use the network given by the company for personal use
 4) jahaan jaruri na ho vahaan mobile eps ke liye jeeyo lokation trekking ko band karen
 5) Keep apps closed when not in use
 6) har jagah wifai conection par vishwaas na karen
 7) Keep information about the privacy policy of the social media site
 8) kisi anjaan site par apni jaankaree saajha na karen

 Anirudh Mahalekhir How does a gay man just rate his sexual experience? From the used condom? From empty beds? Have you come or gone from men? From funny stories narrated to others or rumors spread from their own country? With backstabbing or praise in front of the mouth? From your sheets full of creases or the small things of fatah? Grindr ping or Tinder sniping? From this or that? But first let's see if we have so much scope in which LGBTQIA (lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, Essex +) communities can share sexual experiences? The Supreme Court's landmark verdict repealing parts of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code and finally allowing two gay adults to fall in love with each other even though it has been a year, does it really matter in our everyday lives Has it made a difference? Yes, and no
 pehle jaraa badi tasviir par najar daalen
 After this decision, # lovelevel was trending for a whole month and the number of traps (associated with gay culture) jumped up to the top position through clicks
 hindustan aakhirkaar khulkar saamne aane or sweekaar karne ke bare main, bhaavnaatmak sangharshon or samavesh ke bare main, kism-kism ke rishton or youniktaa ke bare main baat kar rahaa tha or sahi sawaal puch rahaa tha
 People really wanted to know
 magar jab hamaari yon jindagi kii baat aati he, tab ghor khamoshi chaa jaati he
 The country starts panicking with nervousness, "what is there to ask
 
 
 log bistar main kya karte hai, yah puri tarah unka nijee maamla he
 "laugh openly at the irony of this sentence, because of what it may have meant in the pre-377 era
" haa, unke bhi sawaal hua karte the
 But were they the right questions? actually not
 ve munh dabaakar khee-khee karke poochhate, 'tum yah karte kaise ho?' jis sawaal kii ve parvaah nahin karte, vah yah ki 'isse kaisaa mahasoos hota he?'jo desh kamasutra kii rachana par garv karte nahin adhaata, uske lihaaj se ham sex ke bare main baat karne main haroonges dhang se pragatisheel nahin hai
 Especially about gay sex
 sunsaan main dikhaai de, to ausat samalangik aadmi dilkash, milansaar or sajjan hota he, vah vinamr or bhavuk hota he or use hameshaa pataa hota he ki sahi baat kya kehani he
 He talks about fashion and vegetarianism, and how his glutenous muscles ache after foot injuries in the gym
 pehali najar main ausat samalangik aadmi netflix original kaa mukhya kirdaar hota he
 Behind these closed doors you see a whole new sexual revolution taking place
 agyani or ghamandiyon ko jaananaa chahie ki samalangik purush hameshaa grinder, ge baar or (kabhi-kabhaar) golden shower se jude rahenge
 And Chhichore will always send 'great' friends to search for cyber space, or worse, in the corner of public toilets
 30 saal ke ek akele samalangik aadmi kii tarah, jo khud ke bare main utana hi jaagruk he, jitna vah khud se pyaar karata he, mujhe grinder (yaa kisi bhi duusare dating ap) par hone ko lekar koi sankoch nahin he
 Grindr (and a variety of pairing app employees) has been the gay man's golden ticket to sexual freedom
 agar mithkon kii sunen, to aap yah pehle se maan lenge ki harek samalangik kisi behad ghatiya porn film kaa purana ghisa-pita kaamuk aadmi hota he
 But this is the case
 hamaari yon jindagi bhi kisi kii yon jindagi kii tarah he
 Ask any gay man you know and he will tell you that it is all the same
 aakhir main, ham baraabar hai
 The truth is that equality is never happy for society
 iskaa matlab itnaa hi he ki hamen vah sab karne kii aazaadee ho jo ham karnaa chaahate hai, thik hamaare vishmalingi doston kii tarah—jisamen sex ke saath hamaara rishta bhi shaamil he
 We have yet to win half a dozen battles — because when you are dealing with homophobia, transphobia, sexism, and violence against LGBT youth, there is no time for who is having sex with whom and how often
 keval ek baat yaad rakhen
 Until then, stay the same as you are
 yaa kisi bhi us duusare jaise, jo aap hona chaahate hai

 magar mantri ji prabhaav ko dekhte hue maine ise hedline main jagah di he
 i apologize for this crime of mine
 meri vinamrata adarsh or anukaraniya he
 i am a patriot
 sachcha bhi or acha bhi
 The Kambo (pair) of both is rarely found in the patriot, which is visible in me
 isliye ravishankar prasad ke har bayaan ke saath hum
 There is no limit to the qualifications of a minister in a nationalist government
 vah ek hi samay main arthshaastri bhi hota he
 There is also a legalist
 shikshavid bhi hota he
 The politics of nationalism empowers you with unlimited capabilities
 yah baat ravishankar prasad kaa mazaaq udaane vaale kabhi nahin samaj paaenge
 So you should not make fun of Ravi Shankar Prasad's statement
 balki unke is bayaan par harvard main research hona chahie
 If the government does not send this model by itself, then Ravi Shankar Prasad should be sent there through someone you know
 meri raay main ravishankar prasad arthvyavastha ko aankane ke ek nae model ke kareeb pahunch gaye hai
 On which he can also get Nobel Prize
 isliye main unka hausala badha rahaa hum
 You also increase
 mazaaq na udaayen

 ravishankar prasad ne apni baat ke paksh main hard-data diya he
 The three films released on 2 October have grossed more than 120 crores a day
 desh kii arthvyavastha thik he tabhi to filmein bijness kar rahi hai
 This is absolutely right
 desh kii janata unke saath he tabhi to ve arthshaastra kaa ek nayaa model garh paa rahe hai
 The media has no option to go against it
 itnaa saath agar kisi ko mil jaae to vah arthshaastra kya, ek din chunavi sabha main is baat par lacture de saktaa he ki newclear riector kaise banataa he
 The common man can also prepare it by putting bamboo in his house and on this point he can get a tremendous victory in the elections

 Ravi Shankar Prasad has pushed Nirmala Sitharaman's half-hearted model towards perfection
 main unka hausala badhaata hum taaki ve ise puraa karen
 Ravi Shankar Prasad can make a model by taking daily-data of films in all languages
 jisase sakal gharelu utpaadan yani jidipi kaa pratidin sandhya aankalan ho sake
 In my opinion, the Government of India should send one of its officers to the cinema hall counter daily
 taaki hamaare sample collection par koi shaq na kar sake
 If they want, they can add one more thing

 That is why it has to be passed in public and take the Nobel Prize
 ravishankar prasad ne usee press conference main ek or baat kahi he
 Need to laugh at him
 aisi baat kehane kaa saahas kam logon main hota he
 That courage needs to be accepted spontaneously
 mahaamantri mahaprasad ji ne jo kaha he vah adbhut he
 If asked, what is right? ”I call the NSSO report wrong and say it with full responsibility
 us report main electranik, manuphaccharing, iti kshetra, mudra lone or kaaman sarvice sector kaa zikr nahin he
 Why not? We never said that we will give government job to everyone
 ham ye abhi bhi nahin kah rahe hai
 Some people have systematically misrepresented these figures
 yah main dilli main bhi kah chukaa hum
 'if the above paragraph is big, then i am keeping that bold statement in front
 'hamane kabhi nahin kaha tha ki ham sabko sarkari naukari denge
 We are still not saying this
 'meri raay main naujavaanon ne bhi kabhi nahin kaha he ki aap naukari nahin denge to vot nahin denge
 Rather, the youth have voted even if they do not get a job and will give it up
 lekin ye bayaan dekar ravishankar prasad ne sarkaar kaa boj halkaa to kiya hi he
 The youth have also been liberated
 din bhar ye noujvaan zindaabad chhodkar naukari naukari karte rahete hai
 i congratulate Ravi Shankar Prasad for this and also send advance congratulations for the definite victory in all the upcoming elections
 chunki sawaal poochne kii aadat he to khushaamad main sawaal na rah jaae
 i am therefore asking NSSO ke aankade aap nahin maanate hai
 Most do not consider unemployment in 45 years
 aap maalik hai
 Do not believe anything
 par report public to kar dete
 So we would also see how correct you are
 aapane kaha ki isamen manuphaccharing nahi he
 So your data says that the growth of this sector has gone negative
 saadhe paanch saal main yah sector dhansata hi chalaa gaya he
 So tell me how many jobs were created in manufacturing
 yaa aap is par bhi nobel lenaa chaahate he ki jo sector negative growth karata he usamen bhi rojgaar paidaa hota he? agar NSS0 ne nahin diya to aap bataa dijie
 There is no Rahul Gandhi in the government
 vaise mantri ji zyaada lod na len
 Focus on preparing for the celebration of another of your historical political successes
 wo zyaada zaruri he
 Next time i will say that the Liberals have misled the unemployed that they do not have employment

 Do not make fun of the minister by getting in the circle of the Liberals
 sachcha or acha deshbhakt bane

 Criticizing Najma's statement, Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari has said that all the people living in the country are 'indians' and not 'hindus'
 manish tiwari ne kaha ki samvidhan ke mutabik hamaara desh bharat he or yahaan rahane vaale bhartiya hai
 However, when the controversy arose, Najma Heptulla clarified that he had called 'hindi' a national identity
 maine hindu nahin hindi shabd kaa prayag kiya tha
 In fact, BJP leader and Minority Affairs Minister Najma Heptulla had said in an interview to an English newspaper that it is not wrong to call people living in India as Hindus
 najma ke mutabik yah rashtriyata kii pahchaan se judaa maamla he
 Najma had said that the entire Indian population associated with the Hindukush ranges and the Indus River is Hindu and people should not forget this truth of history
 gauratlab he ki haal hi main aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ne kaha tha ki bharat main rahane vaale sabhi log hindu hai

 Puducherry Election Results 2019: Check your Lok Sabha constituency election results 2019 here rafel ke mudde par ek baar phir se congress ne modi sarkaar ko gherne kii koshish kii he
 On behalf of the Congress, Randeep Surjewala and Priyanka Chaturvedi held a press conference and accused the Modi government of stealing Rafale and once again said that the watchman has committed theft
 randeep surajevaala ne india negociation team ke hawaale se kaha ki jab congress kii sarkaar 126 jahaaj kharid rahi thi, tab unamem transfar of technology shaamil thi
 But this is not in the deal of Modi government
 unhone aage kaha ki chaukeedaar kii teesri chori he ki chaukeedaar swany indian negociation team ko bypass kar 36 ladaaku jahaajon kii negoshiation kar rahe the
 Friends, it is sensational that the Indian Negotiation Team did not decide to buy these 36 ships
 iskaa negoshiation ajit dobhaal ne kiya
 Earlier, the Congress retaliated on the attack on the Rafale deal on behalf of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and claimed that the government ignored the report of the High Level Committee constituted to look into the process of the purchase of this fighter aircraft, on which Modi Should answer party ke varisht netaa evam purv raksha mantri e ke antni ne bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah par balakot main vayusena kii karwaai kaa raajnneetikaran karne kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha ki pradhanmantri or shah ko isse bachanaa chahie
 "I salute the valor and sacrifice of our armed forces," Antony told reporters
 ham sabhi ko apane sashastr balon kaa samarthan karnaa chahie
 "he claimed," Our Prime Minister is roaming the country and spreading wrong information
 unhone congress par aarope lagaaya ki kamishan ke liye rafel ke saude main deree kii
 There is no truth in his allegation
 '' purv rakshaamantri ne kaha ki kaig report se saaf he ki purv kii rajg sarkaar ne chaar saal barbaad kiye
 But when the UPA government came, we started the process
 unhone kaha ki prakriya ke dauraan bhaajapa ke netaaon yashavanth sinha or subramanyam swami ne aapatti jataai thi
 After this a committee was formed
 is samiti kii report ko narendra modi sarkaar ne nazarandaaj kiya
 If we had stayed in government and ignored the committee's report, what would have been the response of the CAG? Would this have been the attitude of the media? The Congress leader said, "I was surprised to learn that the report of the committee in this government was neither discussed in the Ministry of Defense nor was it considered in the Cabinet Committee on Security Affairs
" pradhanmantri ko jawaab dena chahie ki unki sarkaar ne samiti kii report kii upeksha kyon kii?" unhone aarope lagaaya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne france ke saath jo qaraar kiya, usamen desh ke rashtriya hiton se samjhauta kiya
 Former Haryana Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala, lodged in Tihar Jail, has been admitted to GB Pant Hospital due to respiratory trouble
 rohinee court ne 13 saal pehle hue shikshak bhartee ghotaale main unhe doshi tehraaya tha
 He is to be sentenced on January 22 in this case
 chautaala ne court se kaha tha ki wo diabetes ke marij hai or unki umr 80 saal se upar he, isliye unke saath narmi barti jaae
 What was the whole matter? Om Prakash Chautala was accused that while holding the post of Chief Minister of Haryana State, he had directed to entrust the recruitment of teachers from the Staff Selection Commission to the committee formed at the district level
 supreme court ke aadesh par sibiai ne jebiti shikshak bhartee ghotaale kii jaanch varsh 2003 main shuru kii
 In January 2004, the CBI registered a case against a total of 62 people, including the then Chief Minister of Haryana, Om Prakash Chautala, after allegations of irregularities in the appointment of teachers came to light
 jaanch agency ne varsh 2008 main aropiyon ke virudgh nyaayalay main aaropapatr daakhil kiya
 According to the charge sheet, in the year 1999-2000, in the case of recruitment of 3206 JBT teachers in 18 districts of the state, the candidates were reinstated keeping the criteria in mind
 iske liye shikshakon kii bhartee kii jimmevary karmchaaree chayan ayog se lekar jila str par banaai gai chayan cameti ko saunpi gai thi
 It prepared a list of selected candidates based on fake interviews
 iske liye jila stareey chayan cameti main shaamil shiksha vibhaag ke adhikariyon par manachaahe abhyarthiyon ke chayan ke liye dilli ke haryana bhawan va chandigarh ke guest house main baithkon main dabaav bhi banaaya gaya tha
 How did the teacher recruitment scam unfold? This scam is between the year 1999 to 2000, in which more than 3206 teachers were recruited
 shiksha vibhaag ke hi ek aies adhikari sanjeev kumaar ne varsh 2003 main supreme court main ek yachika darj kii, jiske baad jaanch sibiai ko saunp di gai
 Om Prakash Chautala was accused of changing the list in JBT recruitment, which was proved in court
 is cese main kul 148 sarkari gavaah the, jinamein se 67 kii gavaahi adaalat main hui or yah sabit hua ki jebiti bhartee main naukari paane vaale har vyakti se 3 se 5 lakh rupye kii rishwat lee gai thi
 Delhi Police Commissioner BS Bassi told NDTV that he would not oppose Kanhaiya's bail, hours after the attack on JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar, who arrived for a hearing at Patiala House Court, Delhi
 gauratlab he ki deshadroh ke aarope main kanhaiya kii giraftaar pichley kuch dinon se rashtriya str par surkhiyon main he
 Police Commissioner Bassi's statement comes at a time when the Opposition has challenged the government and the police to provide evidence that Kanhaiya spoke anti-nationals during a rally in JNU last week
 internet par chal rahe kanhaiya kumaar ke video main kahin bhi nahin dikh rahaa ki vah us samooh main shaamil he jisane 'pakistan jindabad' ke naare lagaae or bharat ke tukade karne kii kasame khain
 But two days after the rally in JNU, the FIR lodged on February 11 alleges treason - which could carry a maximum punishment of life imprisonment - based on footage of the demonstration on news channel Zee News
 isse sawaal uthaanaa lajimi he kyonki jeenyu ke adhikariyon dwaara soochna die jane ke baad police ke 3 consteble saadi vardi main raily main bheje gaye the
 JNU officials had said that the event was organized to question the hanging sentence of Afzal Guru, convicted for the attacks on Parliament in 2001
 exiaar ke anusaar, head consteble rambir (number2923 / SD), consteble karmbir (number 1664 / SD), consteble dharmbir (number 3846 / SD) ko saadi vardi main sabarmati dhaba (jahaan kaarykram yojit hua tha) bheja gaya tha
 Though the three policemen witnessed the incident, nothing has been said about Kanhaiya Kumar in the FIR quoting them
 isaki jagah, police main darj shikaayat ke anusaar 11 farvari ko ji news se footage dene ko kaha gaya or channel ne vaisaa hi kiya
 a police case was then filed, which critics see as a hasty move given the seriousness of the allegations
 internet par uplabdh kisi bhi video main kanhaiya rashtravirohi naare lagaataa nahin dikhataa
 In the rally on 9 February, he can be seen amidst the noise of the students and students of ABVP
 10 farvari ko filmaae gaye do video, jinhen soshal media par share kiya gaya, main kanhaiya jeenyu ke prashasnic bhawan ke saamne sidhiyon par bhaashan detaa dikh rahaa he
 In the first video, Kanhaiya is saying how he respects the Indian Constitution, but is against the Constitution imposed by Nagpur (where bjp's ideological organization RSS is headquartered)
 duusare video main vah aazaadee ke naare lagaataa dikh rahaa he or umr khalid ke bagal main khadaa he
 Omar Khalid is the same student who called a meeting on the Afzal Guru issue
 samiksha karne par pataa chalata he ki kanhaiya jatvaad or purvaagrah se aazaadee kii baat kar rahaa he
 But these things also have not made the basis of treason charge by the police
 mobile phone dwaara record kii gai do clips, jisamen 'pakistan jindabad' ke naare or 'bharat kii barbaadi ' kii awaajen suni ja sakati hai, raat main record kii gai hai
 Seeing them and telling who they are shouting slogans is almost impossible
 ek anya video jo ki spasht he or din main record kiya gaya he, main saaf dikh rahaa he ki kuch log 'bharat tere tukade honge' jaise naare laga rahe hai
 Some people present at the rally say that they were outsiders shouting slogans
 tippaniyan Shehla Rashid, the vice president of the student union that is headed by Kanhaiya Kumar, claimed that he had never heard such slogans on the university campus and tried to stop those people because they did not match the ideology of the leftist unions
 haalanki iskaa koi bhi video maujuud nahin he
 However, it is not yet clear why the organizers were invited by the organizers to the university campus
 police kamishnar bassi kaa bayaan aise samay main aayaa he jab sarkaar or police ko vipaksh ne chunauti di he ki ve is baat ke saboot den ki pichley hafte jeenyu main raily ke dauraan kanhaiya ne rashtravirohi baaten kahin
 There is nowhere in the video of Kanhaiya Kumar running on the internet that he is involved in the group that raised slogans of 'pakistan Zindabad' and vowed to cut India
 lekin jeenyu main hui raily ke do din baad 11 farvari ko darj kii gai exiaar main deshadroh ke aarope lagaae gaye- jisamen adhiktam umrakaid tak kii sajaa ho sakati he- jo ki samachar channel ji news par chale pradarshan kii footage ke aadhaar par kiya gaya
 This is bound to raise the question as 3 police constables were sent to the rally in plain uniform after being given information by JNU officials
 jeenyu adhikariyon ne bataaya tha ki 2001 main sansad par hue hamalon ke doshi afjal guru kii faansee kii sajaa par sawaal uthaane ke liye is kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya gaya tha
 According to the FIR, Head Constable Rambir (no
 2923 / SD), Constable Karmabir (no
 1664 / SD), Constable Dharmabir (no
 3846 / SD) were sent to Sabarmati Dhaba (where the event was held) in plain uniform
 haalanki teenon pulicekarmiyon ne ghatana ko dekha, lekin exiaar main un teenon ke hawaale se kanhaiya kumaar ke bare main kuch bhi nahin kaha gaya he
 Instead, according to the complaint lodged with the police, on February 11, Zee News was asked to give the footage and the channel did the same
 uske baad police cese darj kiya gaya, jise aalochak aaropon kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue jaldbaaji main uthaae gaye kadam ke rup main dekh rahe hai
 Kanhaiya does not appear to raise anti-national slogans in any video available on the Internet
 9 farvari kii raily main use vampanthi chaatro or abivipi ke chaatro ke bich chal rahe shorsharabe ke bich dekha ja saktaa he
 In two videos filmed on February 10, shared on social media, Kanhaiya is seen giving a speech on the stairs in front of jnu's administrative building
 pehle video main kanhaiya kah rahaa he ki kaise vah bhartiya samvidhan kaa sammaan karata he, lekin nagpur (jahaan bijepi ke vaicharik sanghathan aresas kaa mukhyalay he) dwaara thope gaye samvidhan ke khilaaf he
 In the second video he is seen shouting freedom slogans and standing next to Omar Khalid
 umr khalid vahi chaatr he jisane afjal guru mudde ko lekar baithak bulaai thi
 Upon review, we find that Kanhaiya is talking about freedom from casteism and prejudice
 lekin in baton ko bhi police ne deshadroh ke aarope kaa aadhaar nahin banaaya he
 Two clips recorded by mobile phones, in which the slogans of 'pakistan Zindabad' and the sounds of 'india's waste' can be heard, are recorded at night
 inhen dekhakar ye bataanaa ki ve naare koun laga rahaa he, lagbhag naammumkin he
 In another video which is clear and recorded on the day, it is clearly seen that some people are shouting slogans like 'bharat Tere Chote Hoga'
 raily main maujuud kuch logon kaa kahana he ki ye naare lagane vaale bahari log the
 The comments jis chaatr sangh kaa adhyaksh kanhaiya kumaar he, uski upaadhyaksh shehla rashid ne daawa kiya ki unhone vishvavidhyalay ke campus main kabhi bhi aise naare nahin sune the or unhone un logon ko rokane kii koshish bhi kii kyonki ye vampanthi unionon kii vichaardhaara se mail nahin khate
 However, there is no video of this
 haalanki yah abhi tak spasht nahin he ki aayojakon dwaara aisi vichaardhaara vaale logon ko vishvavidhyalay parisar main aamantrit hi kyon kiya gaya
 There is nowhere in the video of Kanhaiya Kumar running on the internet that he is involved in the group that raised slogans of 'pakistan Zindabad' and vowed to cut India

 isaki jagah, police main darj shikaayat ke anusaar 11 farvari ko ji news se footage dene ko kaha gaya or channel ne vaisaa hi kiya
 a police case was then filed, which critics see as a hasty move given the seriousness of the allegations
 internet par uplabdh kisi bhi video main kanhaiya rashtravirohi naare lagaataa nahin dikhataa
 In the rally on 9 February, he can be seen amidst the noise of the students and students of ABVP
 10 farvari ko filmaae gaye do video, jinhen soshal media par share kiya gaya, main kanhaiya jeenyu ke prashasnic bhawan ke saamne sidhiyon par bhaashan detaa dikh rahaa he
 In the first video, Kanhaiya is saying how he respects the Indian Constitution, but is against the Constitution imposed by Nagpur (where bjp's ideological organization RSS is headquartered)
 duusare video main vah aazaadee ke naare lagaataa dikh rahaa he or umr khalid ke bagal main khadaa he
 Omar Khalid is the same student who called a meeting on the Afzal Guru issue
 samiksha karne par pataa chalata he ki kanhaiya jatvaad or purvaagrah se aazaadee kii baat kar rahaa he
 But these things also have not made the basis of treason charge by the police
 mobile phone dwaara record kii gai do clips, jisamen 'pakistan jindabad' ke naare or 'bharat kii barbaadi ' kii awaajen suni ja sakati hai, raat main record kii gai hai
 Seeing them and telling who they are shouting slogans is almost impossible
 ek anya video jo ki spasht he or din main record kiya gaya he, main saaf dikh rahaa he ki kuch log 'bharat tere tukade honge' jaise naare laga rahe hai
 Some people present at the rally say that they were outsiders shouting slogans
 tippaniyan Shehla Rashid, the vice president of the student union that is headed by Kanhaiya Kumar, claimed that he had never heard such slogans on the university campus and tried to stop those people because they did not match the ideology of the leftist unions
 haalanki iskaa koi bhi video maujuud nahin he
 However, it is not yet clear why the organizers were invited by the organizers to the university campus
 haalanki teenon pulicekarmiyon ne ghatana ko dekha, lekin exiaar main un teenon ke hawaale se kanhaiya kumaar ke bare main kuch bhi nahin kaha gaya he
 Instead, according to the complaint lodged with the police, on February 11, Zee News was asked to give the footage and the channel did the same
 uske baad police cese darj kiya gaya, jise aalochak aaropon kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue jaldbaaji main uthaae gaye kadam ke rup main dekh rahe hai
 Kanhaiya does not appear to raise anti-national slogans in any video available on the Internet
 9 farvari kii raily main use vampanthi chaatro or abivipi ke chaatro ke bich chal rahe shorsharabe ke bich dekha ja saktaa he
 In two videos filmed on February 10, shared on social media, Kanhaiya is seen giving a speech on the stairs in front of jnu's administrative building
 pehle video main kanhaiya kah rahaa he ki kaise vah bhartiya samvidhan kaa sammaan karata he, lekin nagpur (jahaan bijepi ke vaicharik sanghathan aresas kaa mukhyalay he) dwaara thope gaye samvidhan ke khilaaf he
 In the second video he is seen shouting freedom slogans and standing next to Omar Khalid
 umr khalid vahi chaatr he jisane afjal guru mudde ko lekar baithak bulaai thi
 Upon review, we find that Kanhaiya is talking about freedom from casteism and prejudice
 lekin in baton ko bhi police ne deshadroh ke aarope kaa aadhaar nahin banaaya he
 Two clips recorded by mobile phones, in which the slogans of 'pakistan Zindabad' and the sounds of 'india's waste' can be heard, are recorded at night
 inhen dekhakar ye bataanaa ki ve naare koun laga rahaa he, lagbhag naammumkin he
 In another video which is clear and recorded on the day, it is clearly seen that some people are shouting slogans like 'bharat Tere Chote Hoga'

 Bhardwaj, who was the Governor of Karnataka, dismissed Chidambaram's arguments on the 2G issue and said that if he had taken care of the state exchequer properly as finance minister, it would not have been a scam
 bharadwaj ne kaha, 'main nahin samajhataa ki chidambaram jo kah rahe hai vah sahi he
 This is exactly the reverse

 Seventeenth Lok Sabha has started
 sansad satr ke shuruaati do din saansadon ke shapath grahan ke liye rakhe gaye the
 During this time the view of the Lok Sabha was completely different, most of the newly elected mps went against the rules and raised slogans related to religious identity after the oath
 loksabhaa main jis tarah se tokaatoki or hangaame ke bich jai shri ram ke jawaab main allaah hu akbar ke naare lagaae ja rahe the, uske baad yah saaf ho gaya he ki shapath grahan to ek trailor he or aane vaale dinon main sansad main jamkar morchabandi dikhegi
 Actually, slogans related to religious identity were being raised during the swearing-in of the Lok Sabha
 loksabhaa main kai saansadon ne shapath ke baad jahaan apni vaicharik pansad ke naare lagaae to zyaadaatar saansadon ne shapath ke baad jai shriram, jai maa kaali, jai bhim, jai samaajwaad, radhe radhe, vaahe guru di khalasa vaahe guru di fateh, allaah hu akbar or samvidhan jindabad jaise naare lagaae
 At the same time, an MP called Vande Mataram against Islam
 isi ke chalate protem spikar ko kai baar shapath ke alaava koi or baat ricard main na jane kii baat kehani padi
 Whenever an MP was coming to take oath in Lok Sabha, BJP MP would start shouting slogans of Jayashree Ram
 isi dauraan jab baari sanbhal se jitkar aae sapa ke saansad shafikurrahman bark kii ai to bijepi saansadon ne jayshri ram or vande maataram kaa naaraa lagaana tej kar diya
 After taking the oath, Burke said, 'the Constitution of India is alive
 ' iske baad bark ne vande maataram ko islam ke khilaaf bataaya
 On this, BJP mps in the House raised slogans of Shem Shem
 isi bich loksabhaa main AIMIM ke chif asaduddin ovaisi ke shapath grahan kii baari ai to sadan main joardaar hangaamaa dekhne ko mila
 As soon as Owaisi got up from his seat, BJP mps who came to Vail to take the oath started planting Jayashree Ram, Vande Mataram and Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 iske baad ovaisi ne apni shapath grahan puraa kiya or ant main jai bhim, jai mim, allaah-hu-akbar or jai hind ke naare lagaae
 Similarly, MP Tahir Khan Chowdhury, who won Murshidabad seat in West Bengal, also raised slogans of Inshallah, Jai Hind, Jai Bangla, Khuda Hafiz and allah-hu-akbar in response to the slogans of BJP mps
 bataa den ki hemamalini ne shapath lene ke baad radhe radhe or krishnam vande jagat guru kaa naaraa lagaaya
 BJP MP Ravindra Kushwaha from Salempur in Uttar Pradesh said 'jai yogi-jai Modi' after taking oath
 basapa sadasyon ne shapath ke baad jaybhim to sapa ke sadasyon ne jai samaajwaad ke naare lagaae
 Earlier on the first day of the session, there was a lot of uproar during the swearing-in of Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, who came from Bhopal as an MP
 sadhvi ne apane naam ke aage swami purna chetananand avadheshanand giri kaa naam jodakar shapath lee jisapar vipakshi saansadon ne aapatti jataai
 In support of Sadhvi, many BJP mps also rose from the seat and started shouting slogans, finally Sadhvi took oath in the name of God
 loksabhaa main saansadon ke shapath grahan ke dauraan aisa najaara pehali baar dekhne mila tha, jab shapath ke baad itani badi sankhya main saansad dharmik naare lagaate dikhe or jamkar morchabandi dikhi
 At the same time, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi has made a strategy to sit with opposition parties and surround the government in Parliament

 The government can use the 'aadhaar' number to implement the 'national Health Protection Scheme' of health insurance announced in the budget so that its rightful beneficiaries get it
 aadhaar card kii madad se beemaa clem kii raashi diarector benifit transfar (DBT) ke dwaara sidhe aspataal ke khate main pahunch jaaegi
 Earlier this has been used in the case of fertilizer subsidy
 ikanomik times ne sutron ke hawaale se khabar di he ki 'modicare' ke naam se charchit is yojana ko lagu karne ke liye sarkaar ke varisht adhikariyon main hui charchaa ke dauraan is par bhi baat hui ki iske liye aadhaar card kaa istemaal kiya jaae
 It is to be noted that Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act states that if any scheme is spent from the consolidated fund of the Government of India, it will have to be linked to Aadhaar
 is yojana ke liye 11,000 karod rupee jutaney ke liye bajet main vitt mantri ne 1 fisadi kaa atirikt ses lagaaya he
 UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey said that Aadhaar can help in running such programs properly
 jo log vaazib hakdaar hai unhen beemaa kaa laabh lene main koi kathinaayee nahin aegi
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said in his budget speech that under the scheme, about 50 crore people of 10 crore poor families will be given health insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh annually
 sarkaar ke varisht adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki 50 karod labhaarthiyon vaali itani badi yojana ko bina aadhaar ke lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa
 It is worth noting that the LPG subsidy received by about 14-15 crore people has to be paid through Aadhaar and DBT only
 ye honge phydeadhar kaa phayda yah hoga ki isse logon kaa ek to saaf-suthradeta besataiyaar milegaa or aadhaar card hone kii vajah se kisi vyakti ke aspataal pahunchane par uskaa tatkaal ilaaj shuru ho sakegaa
 It will prove to be very helpful in case of emergency or cancer treatment
 yahi nahin, isse kisi tarah ke farjivade par bhi ankush lagegaa

 kisi khilaadi ke jivan par bani film kaa uski jindagi se aage kii baat hona lajimi he
 And it is good that the producers of the film Mary Kom remind us that Priyanka Chopra's film Boxer is based on the life events of Mary Kom
 ” is mukkebaaz kii jindagi kii aisi kya ghatana ho sakati he, jise ham ek bade sandesh ke rup main dekh sakate hai?jivan kii vah ghatana kya 2012 ke olympic main mahila boxing ko shaamil karnaa he, taaki ham mairi com kii jeet ko apni un upekshit mahila cricket khiladinnon se jodakar dekh saken, jinhen utani prashansa or paryaapt samarthan nahin mil rahaa he
 The life stories of the great players in the game take a moment when they decide to risk losing everything for the game and dedicate themselves to victory
 haalanki unhen bakhubi pataa hota he ki ve jo kariyar chun rahe hai, usamen kamyaabi kii koi guarantee nahin he or vah kabhi bhi khatm ho saktaa he
 In the beginning of my career, when i used to talk to the players, i always used to ask questions about them and i used to get a dull answer every time
 isse meri samaj main aa jaataa tha ki mahaan khilaadi mujhase or aapse bilkul alag hote hai
 They do not see the word risk in the sense that we see you
 iskaa jawaab hamen unke jivan kii ghatnaon ko dekhne se mil saktaa he
 Mary Kom was a veteran of women's boxing even before she showed up at the London Olympics
 ve paanch baar vishwa champion kaa khitaab jeet chuki thim or olympic medal jeetne ke samay tak boxing main apana behtareen daur guzaar chuki thim
 2012 included women's boxing in the Olympics
 mairi com ne pratiyogita main hissaa lene ke us maukey ko haath se nahin jane diya
 At the Olympics, he was not a weight class (pinweight 46 kg, later 48 kg), so he increased the weight (flyweight, 51 kg)
 unhone khud ko us maukey ke anuroop taiyaar kiya
 In doing so, he showed that such occasions can create unforgettable events of life and those events can be the driving force to carry forward the sports tradition
 mahilaon ko aaj jis tarah se kai khelon main maukey mil rahe hai, usase khel main ho rahi tarakkee ko saaf taur par aanka ja saktaa he
 You can guess it from the Olympic Games
 pichley dinon olympic se kushti ko nikaalane ke saath is khel ke liye khatra paidaa ho gaya tha
 Thus, a method was adopted to save survival: the medals of men were reduced and the medals for women were increased
 mahilaon ke liye medal sankhya badhaane ke zikr bhar se hi kaamanwealth khelon main gold medal jeetne vaali babitha phogat kaa cheharaa garv se damak uthaa
 Her sport has made it more than ever for women at the highest level of competition
 ve olympic main koi padak jeet paaen yaa na jeet paaen, yah alag baat he
 But at least possibilities exist for them and that is more important
 yah baat desh kii mahila cricket khiladinnon ko bhi bataane kii koshish karen
 There is a good chance of winning the medal in the Asian Games, but the Indian women cricketer will not be present in the squad going to Incheon in South Korea this month
 vahaan mahila cricket ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 But the Indian women cricketer who recently won a Test match in England cannot even dare to dream of participating in it
 antarrashtriya cricket council ke kehane par sudhaar abhiyaan ke tahat 2006 main desh main mahila cricket kaa jimmaa sanbhaalane vaala bhartiya cricket control board (bisisiai) asian khelon main mahila team ko hissaa nahin lene degaa
 The BCCI will not participate in any tournament with multiple games, avoiding sharing the broadcast profits of the men's team with anyone
 use isse koi fark nahin padataa ki yah khel kii bhaavana ke khilaaf he
 He does not mind that doing so eliminates the possibility of cricket getting a chance in the Olympics
 swaittata ke aavaran ke bheetar bisisiai ne olympic main cricket ko shaamil karne kii yojana kaa virodh kiya he
 It is also not worried that joining the medal-winning competition will help the T20 game to establish itself as an established sport
 bhartiya cricket ko apane kabje main rakhane kii ichha kii vajah se bisisiai apni mahila cricket khiladinnon ko kisi bade aayojan main hissaa lene kaa mauka nahin degaa
 In comparison, other Test-playing Asian countries — Pakistan (the gold medal winner in the inaugural competition at the last Asian Games in Guangzhou), Bangladesh and Sri Lanka — are sending their women's teams
 ab bataaie ki kisi khilaadi ko jivan kii un ghatnaon se vanchit karnaa kahaan tak uchit he, jo kisi bhartiya mahila cricketer ke kariyar ko roshan kar sakati hai

 However, the middle-order failure remains a cause of concern for India as only Virender Sehwag (54 off 56) was able to face the bowlers out of the team after winning the toss and batting first
 bharat kii taraf se koi ardhashtakeey saajhedaari nahin nibhaai gai or uski puri team 44
 Reduced to 214 runs in 3 overs
 chawla ne 31 ran dekar chaar or harbhajan ne 15 ran dekar teen wicket liye or australia ke liye yah score bhi bada sabit kar diya
 The good thing for the Australian team was that after recovering from injury, returning captain Ricky Ponting (57 off 85 balls) was able to practice the batting well enough
 unke alaava tim pen (37) or shen watasan (33) kii salaami jodi hi kuch ran bator pai, lekin antim nau wicket 58 ran ke andar ganvaane se uski puri team 37
 Stacked for 176 runs in 5 overs

 Watson and Penn shared a 51-run partnership for the first wicket to give Australia a bang
 ponting or pen ne duusare wicket ke liye 67 ran jode, lekin iske baad keval viketon kaa patjhad dekhne ko mila
 Ponting scored three fours on r Ashwin as soon as he came, but after that he also had a lot of trouble scoring runs in front of spinners especially Chawla
 bich main 19 over tak keval ek baar gend ne seemaa rekha ke darshan kiye
 Although Australia looked in good condition till the score of 118 for one wicket, their middle order collapsed badly after Chawla's spell
 isaki shuruyaat yuvaraj ne pen ko out karke kii jiske baad chawla ne umdaa leg brake par maaikel clark (0) ko bold kiya or phir camerun white or david hassi ko lagaataar gend par pavilion kii raah dikhaai
 Callum Fagrusan got a life, but could not take advantage of this and was caught in Chawla's net in the next over
 harbhajan singh ne ek chor sanbhale rakhane vaale ponting, mishael janson (15) or jaisan kreja ko out karke bharat kii jeet sunishchit kii
 Except for Sehwag, no Indian batsman has been able to stand up to the Australian fast bowlers
 viraat kohli (21), dhoni (11) or suresh raina (12) sabhi ne kuch samay krij par bitaayaa, lekin jab team ko jarurat thi, tab unhone apane wicket ganvaae
 India's batting performance was such that the biggest participation from their side was Pathan of 49 runs and r Ashwin (25 not out) for the ninth wicket

 'people started to understand that this game of gentlemen has become clean again
 lekin 2010 main ek aisa maamla saamne aayaa jisane hamen ye bataaya ki samay ke saath-saath phixing kaa tarika or jariye bhi badal gaye hai
 In the same year, three members of the Pakistani team who went on a tour of England, according to a sting operation, were involved in 'spot fixing'
 puraa maamla saamne aane par pataa chalaa, ki apane captain salmaan batt ke kehane par tej gendbaajon mohammad aamir or mohammad asif ne jaanboojhkar 'no ball' phenki thi
 No ball is no crime now, so why did there be so much ruckus on it? 'scholars' say that these types of things are a 'new form' of fixing, which causes the snake to die and the sticks do not break
 england samet kuch deshon main khelon par sattebaaji vaid he, or satta sirf is baat par nahin lagata ki koun si team match jeetegi, balki choti-choti baton par bhi lagata he, jaise kya falaan over main koi gend 'wide' yaa no ball hogi, yaa kya koi ballebaaj falaan over 'madan' khelegaa yaa nahin?ab ferj kiijie ki kisi team kaa captain or gendbaaj aapaki mutthi main he
 You give him 10 rupees and say that brother, get the 20th over of the match to the bowler and tell him not to bowl the second ball of the over
 ab aapane isi baat par 100 satta laga diya ki 20wein over kii duusari gend no ball hogi or aisa hone par isse 500 rupee kam liye
 So by doing this, you also reduced the fat profits and the match was not fixed
 us no ball ke ek ran se test match ke nattejey par bhi koi khaas fark padane kii sambhaavna nahin he, or phixing bhi nahin hui
 The 'speculative scholars' also say that the outcome of every match may not be fixed, but the spot fixing is basically behind so many 'close matches' being played in recent years
 bade-bade buki, jinke khilaadiyon se najdiki rishte hai, ve match kii disha tay karte hai
 According to which team people have betted on how much money, bookies decide the betting price and the attitude of the match accordingly so that they themselves get maximum benefit from it
 ant main match kaa nateeja chaahe usee team ke paksh main nikle, jiske paksh main nateeja aane kii sabko ummid thi, lekin match hue hue utaar-chadhaav se lagane vaale satte se buki motaa munafa kam lete hai
 Or, as has been revealed in the latest revelations in the IPL, that a bowler will tell his bookie by a special gesture that he is going to give more runs in this over, and the bookie takes less money sitting down, Some part of which will also be given to the player
 aise main match ke nattejey par bhi khaas fark nahin padaa, khiladi match ko 'fiks karne ke kalank' se bhi batch gaye or 'upree' kamai bhi ho gayi
 But wrong is wrong, whether it is match fixing or spot fixing !! When match fixing cases come up, 'intelligent people' invented spot fixing; Now let's see if there is a new invention when spot fixing comes to the fore? The possibilities are complete, why some scholars have also said - Father not big brother, biggest Rupaiya! loksabhaa chunaav 2019 kii raajnneetik jang fatah karne ke liye congress alag-alag rajyon main vibhinn siyaasi partiyon ke saath gathbandhan karne main juty he
 In this episode, Congress President Rahul Gandhi called a meeting of senior party leaders in Delhi on the issue of alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party, in which it has been decided that the Congress will not contest elections in Delhi with the AAP
 rahul gandhi ke saath baithak ke baad dilli congress pradesh adhyaksh shila dikshit ne saaf kar diya he ki dilli main aam aadmi party ke saath congress gathbandhan nahin karegi
 Sheila said, 'we told Rahulji that one should not tie up with AAP
 is par unhone sahmati vyakt kar di he
 Although he said that the AAP is showing the compulsion of the alliance, but we are not ready
 hamane sarvasammati se faisla kiya he ki congress party AAP ke saath milakar chunaav nahin ladegi
 Explain that for the alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party, the Congress will be in the afternoon at the residence of President Rahul Gandhi
 rahul ne dilli pradesh congress adhyaksh shila dikshit ke saath-saath teenon kaaryakari adhyakshon- purv vidhayak harun yusuf, rajesh lilothia or devendra yadav ko bulaayaa gaya he
 Apart from this, former presidents of the party have also been called in the said meeting
 aam aadmi party lambey samay se congress ke saath gathbandhan karne par jor de rahi he
 Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had even said that we are ready, but the Congress is not ready for this
 ye baat ajtak ko die gaye intervyuu main bhi vah kah chuke hai
 Now in the changed political situation, the exercise of coalition has started once again
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke saath dilli pradesh congress netaaon kii mangalvaar ko ho rahi baithak main mana ja rahaa he gathbandhan par muhar lag sakati he
 If sources are to be believed, a formula has also been suggested for 7 Lok Sabha seats in Delhi
 iske tahate congress 3, aam aadmi party 3 or ek seat nirdaleey ke khate main ja sakati he
 However, a camp in the Congress is still not in favor of the alliance
 darasal, dilli main aam aadmi party ne dilli kii 6 loksabhaa siton par apane ummidavaaron ke naam kii ghoshnaa kar chuke hai
 Aam Aadmi Party has fielded Brijesh Goyal from New Delhi parliamentary seat, Atishi from East Delhi, Dilip Pandey from North East Delhi, Raghav Chadha from South Delhi, Pankaj Gupta from Chandni Chowk and Gugan Singh from North West Delhi
 gauratlab he ki unhone yah baaten porbandar ke nikat madhavpur ghed main samskruti mantralay or gujarat sarkaar dwaara sanyukt rup se yojit madhavpur utsav ke dauraan kahi

 The special thing is that this year this festival is being held from 25 to 28 March
 (input bhashaa se) The double bench of Punjab and Haryana High Court will now hear on December 11 in the final rites of Ashutosh Maharaj
 court ne shuukravaar ko keval taarikh dekar chhod diya
 An appeal has been filed in the court in the case of the samadhi or death of Ashutosh Maharaj, head of Divya Jyoti Jagriti Sansthan Nurmahal of Jalandhar
 ashutosh maharaj kaa shav beete janvari se hidip freedoramen rakhaa hua he
 This appeal has been filed against the decision of the High Court, in which the court has ordered Ashutosh Maharaj to perform the last rites within 15 days of cocanical deadman
 ab divya jyoti santhaan ne hoicourt ke is faisle ke khilaaf hoicourt ke hi dabl bench main apil daayar kii he jisaki sunwaayee aaj ho sakati he
 The grace that the High Court has given Ashutosh Maharaj to be cremated by removing him from his tomb is ending on 15 December
 yani adalati aadesh ke hisaab se 15 disambar se pehle-pehle antim sanskaar ho janaa chahie
 But Maharaj's seekers have announced to organize a huge satsang on December 14 and 15 in his ashram i
e
 Divya Jyoti Jagriti Sansthan
 udhar, khud ko ashutosh maharaj kaa betaa kehane vaale dilip kumaar jha naam ke ek shaks ne shav par apana haq jataayaa he
 According to him, he should get the right to cremate his father
 yachikakarta dilip ne ashutosh maharaj ke maut par bhi sawaal khadey kiye hai
 According to him, there is a deep conspiracy behind this
 ashutosh maharaj ke sabase puraane raajadaar or driver puuran singh kaa iljaam he ki maharaj kii arabon kii sampatti hadapney ke liye unheen ke kuch saadhakon ne unka katl kar maamle ko dabaane ke liye samadhi kaa rang de diya he
 Puran Singh has also filed a petition in the High Court and appealed to the CBI to investigate the matter
 doctor ashutosh maharaj ko 29 janvari 2014 ko hi murda qaraar de chuke hai
 But Maharaj's devotees are not ready to accept this
 unka to ye kahana he ki maharaj khud apni marji se gahari samadhi main leen hai
 And in such a situation, it is impossible to think about him, even if he is cremated, and these devotees of Maharaj have kept his dead body in a freezer in Nurmahal Ashram near Jalandhar
 santhaan ke chaaron ore suraksha ke liye pehle hi machaan bane hai, jinamein ab 24 ghante ashram ke suraksha guard tainaat kar die gaye hai
 Moreover, no other person is allowed to enter the ashram without searching
 lekin haalat tab or gambhir ho jaati he
 When the entry of law keepers i
e
 policemen is also banned in the ashram
 ab har kisi ko ye dar he ki kahin ye maamla sant rampal ke satalok ashram kii tarah pechida naa ho jaae
 While hearing the plea of dilip Kumar Jha, the High Court has given an ultimatum of 15 days to the Punjab government for the funeral of Ashutosh Maharaj, the question mark still exists on Ashutosh Maharaj's relationship with the same Dilip Kumar Jha Huh
 court ne dilip ko ashutosh maharaj kaa betaa maanane se inkaar kar diya he, jabaki dilip or maharaj ke driver puuran singh is maamle par hai court kii dabl bench main nae sire se yachika daakhil karne kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Actually, Dilip Kumar Jha had filed an application in the High Court stating that he was the son of Ashutosh Maharaj
 uski sunwaayee karte hue adaalat ne unhen khud ko maharaj kaa betaa sabit karne ko kaha
 On this, Dileep presented many documents and evidence in his court
 lekin adaalat ne unhen thukraa diya
 In such a situation, Dilip Kumar Jha Maharaj wants to get his DNA tested so that milk can have milk and water
 haalanki philhal itnaa to saaf he ki maharaj bhi mul rup se bihar ke madhubani ke nalkhor gaanv ke rahanevaale the or unka asli naam mahesh kumaar jha hua karata tha
 After the new applications of Dileep and Puran, it will be a matter of which camel will sit in the case
