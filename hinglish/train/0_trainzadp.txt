 Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has recently launched Redmi K20, Redmi K20 Pro in the Indian market
 ye Xiaomi ke sab brands Redmi ke pehla flagship smartphone he
 There has been a lot of discussion about the price of Redmi K20 series in India
 kuch logon ne kaha ki company ne isaki keemat zyada rakhi he
 Some say that the company is not known for expensive smartphones
 lekin sabase pehle ye bataa den ki spacifications or fitures ke lihaaj se hamen Redmi K20 Pro kii keemat thik lagi
 Price - Rs 27,999
 Redmi K20 Pro ko kuch samay tak yuj karne ke baad mujhe ye bhi laga ki ye aisa smartphone he jo duusare android flagship kii bikri par asar daal saktaa he
 However, it also has its own drawbacks, about which you will understand yourself by reading this review
 dizin or bild qualityphone kii bild quality main koi samasya nahin he
 Body glass has Gorilla Glass 5 also used on the rear panel
 ise glass sandwich dizin bhi kaha jaataa he
 i have reviewed the Glacier Blue variant
 dizin par company ne vaaki kaam kiya he or ye kaaphi shandaar lagata he
 The phone fits well in the hand and with one hand you will be able to use it
 rier panel karvd he isliye ise hold karnaa aasaan he
 The rear panel is a fingerprint magnet, but it is only for the center
 donon taraf blue color hai jise fingerprint se kai asar nahin hota he
 On the rear panel, there is a camera lens at the top of the center, a module has two lenses below it and dual LED flash light is given below it
 centre bottm main Redmi kii branding he
 There is a pop up selfie on the top and it glows
 upar hi headphone jaik bhi diya gaya he
 On the right side is the red color home button and volume rocker keys
 bottm main spikar gril he, USB Type c ke saath yahaan sim trey diya gaya he
 Overall, the look and feel of the Redmi K20 Pro is quite good and looks like a completely premium smartphone
 displaceshedmi K20 Pro main 6
 a 39-inch AMOLED display is provided
 puraa front sirf disple he
 Bazels are non-existent, although a chin is given, meaning below you will see bezels
 screen kaa rijolushan phul echdi plus he yani ye 1080X2340 he
 The under display at the bottom of the display replaces the fingerprint scanner
 phone locd he, screen band he phir bhi aap disple ke nichle hisse main tap karke under disple fingerprint ko actevet karke phone analock kar sakate hai
 The display of Redmi K20 Pro is bright and colorful
 vuing angel bhi acha he
 Running on dark mode has been a great experience
 dark mod opshan diya gaya he jise aap yuj kar sakate hai
 Always on feature is also provided, which you can customize
 cameraedmi K20 Pro main teen rier camere die gaye hai
 One of them is 48 megapixels, the other is 8 megapixels, the third is 13 megapixel ultra wide lens
 company ne depth sencing ke bajaae isamen telephoto lens diya he jo acchhee baat he
 Apart from this, it has face detection autofocus, laser autofocus, optical image stabilization and 2X optical zoom
 selfi ke liye isamen single motlifed pop ap camera diya gaya he jo 20 megapixl he
 Also, full HD videos can be recorded at 30 frames per second
 camera impressive he
 Photos are good clicks
 difolt 48 megapixl nahin he, iske liye aapako camera interphes se 48 megapixl select karnaa hoga
 We have also told you about Sony's sensor used in it
 delite main photose kaaphi behtareen aati hai, 48 megapixl select karke clic karne main thodaa samay lagata he
 Indoor photos, or photos in low light, are averaged
 liting sahi ho to is phone ke camere kamaal dikhaate hai or aisi tasviir clic karte hai jo sharp, ditels se bharpoor or solid hoti hai
 Colors are also correct, there is no problem of over saturation also
 wide angel lens kaaphi badhiya he, yahaan bhi photo quality ke saath zyada samjhauta nahin hota he or aapako acha rigelt miltaa he
 Portrait photos are also good and the camera separates objects well from background to camera
 close ap shots bhi kamaal ke aate hai
 HD preview is an option in pictures clicked with 48 megapixels
 yani photo ko chaar baar tap karke aap photo kii gaharaai main ja sakate hai
 This is really good video recording kii baat karen to yahaan bhi kuch mods milte hai
 It has movement tracking mode which you may like
 phone ko is mod par daal kar photography kar sakate hai agar koi object mowing he to aap bina move kiye hi use trek kar sakate hai
 But it also has a limit
 video recording 60fps ke saath 4K kar sakate hai
 Talking about selfie, this smartphone can click decent selfie
 pop ap camera main ek lite he jo glo karti he
 This light will appear as soon as the pop up camera comes out or when you put the phone on charge
 haalanki aap settings se ise of bhi kar sakate hai
 The logic of the company is that because of this light, people will be able to focus on the camera while taking a selfie
 front camera bhi acchhee detel vaali tasviren clic karata he
 Performance Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro has Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 which is 7nm based
 isamen chaar power iffishient course die gaye hai
 This smartphone has 8GB RAM and here the company has UFS 2
 1 storage kaa istemaal kiya he
 Android Pie based MIUI 10 is available here in the software department
 aap isamen Poco launture bhi yuj kar sakate hai
 i have mostly used it with Poco Launcher and it is good
 yah smartphone top noch parformens detaa he
 Whether it is gaming or multi-tasking, it does not disappoint you
 phone fast he, smood he or lag nahin mahasoos hota he
 However, during gaming and running many apps with it, there was a slight lag in the phone which should not have happened
 multi tasking kii baat karen to Poco launture acha kaam karata he or ek es se duusare ap main switch karnaa kaaphi aasaan he
 Open multiple apps simultaneously, keep running in the background and do not take time to load
 rifresh rate oneplus 7 Pro ke level kii nahin he, lekin ek aam yujar ko isse koi khaas fark nahin padataa he
 The company should do a little more work on the MIUI 10
 icons se lekar pre instold eps tak main kuch badlaav yaa riffinement kii jarurat he
 Due to the full screen display, our experience in watching videos or gaming has been good
 dark mod par phone ko yuj karnaa or bhi shandaar rahaa he
 There is no major reduction in overall performance and it is quite a smart smartphone for mixed use
 bydaree ballpaladhiomi Redmi K20 Pro main 4,000mah kii bydaree di gai he
 In the box you get an 18W charger
 haalanki ye phone Quick Charge 4+ kaa saport diya gaya he
 But for this you have to buy charger from outside
 shaomi ne 27W kaa Sonic charger launch kiya he jisaki keemat 999 rupee he
 Talking about backup, my experience in this has been mixed
 4,000mah kii bydaree hone ke baavjood aapako thik thaak bydaree life mil jaati he
 Full day backup can be found in mixed use
 pabaji, video, active soshal media acounts or gane sun kar bhi aap chahen to subah se raat tak byaap nikaal sakate hai
 If you use the phone less then this phone will give you 1
 5 din kaa byaap degaa
 Should you buy this smartphone? Redmi K20 Pro is a very good smartphone in this segment
 lagbhag har department main ye ipressive he
 There are more smartphones at this price
 lekin kuch smartfones kii disple acchhee he, parformens acha he, lekin camera acha nahin he
 It makes up the shortcoming - Redmi K20 Pro

 Earlier, Vidya Balan while talking about her film said, "I am very excited to play the role of human computer Shakuntala Devi on the big screen
 vah vaaki wo mahila thim jinhone apni atmiyata ko nahin choda, jisaki ek majboot nariwadi aawaaj thi or jeet ke liye vah bahut bahaduree se ladati thim
 However, the thing that impresses me the most is that you don't usually see a funny person associating with mathematics
 "view this post on instagramexcitement is multiplying each day! Time to dig into the 'root' of the mathematical genius, # shakuntaladevi
 # filmingbegins @sonypicsprodns @abundantiaent @directormenon @ivikramix @sneharajani_a post shared byvidya Balan (@balanvidya) onsep 15, 2019 at 10:50 pm PDT Earlier Vidya was seen in multistarrer film Mission Mangal, which did good business at the box office
 yun to filmon main vidya ko zyaadaatar sari, dress or salwar suut main dekha jaataa he, lekin is baar sari main hone ke baavjood, vidya baalan diferent najar aa rahi hai
 Vidya looks very much like Shakuntala Devi in bob haircut and saree

 com / 7tchs1h2vp On 6 February, on Slap Day, till now you must have heard that slapping someone makes things worse
 magar aisa nahin he
 It is also good to slap many times
 manovishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki agar aapako kisi par bahut tej gussa aa rahaa he
 So much that if you are thinking of killing him, then just give him a slap, all your anger will come out
 lekin haa ise apane bos par mat aajamaaiye varanaa aapaki naukari hi khatre main pad jaayegi
 Psychiatric doctor Medha Gore told, "if you are angry with someone to such an extent that if you don't want to see his face, then slap him, your anger will reduce immediately
 darasal jab bhi hamen gussa aata he to hamaare sharir main ek khaas tarah kaa hormone nikalne lagata he
 That hormone increases the level of energy in our body, which increases the heat in our body and our anger becomes more intense
 lekin jab ham kisi ko thappad maarthe hai to hamaare sharir kii urja kaa ek bada hissaa jo gusse ko badha rahaa tha thappad maarane main chalaa jaataa he
 This is the reason why our anger gradually reduces
 ’ manovishleshak doctor sanjeev tyaagi kaa kahana he, ‘gussa aane par hamaara sabase khatarnaak kadam hota he kisi ko shaareerik taur par nuksaan pahunchaana or jab aap use shaareerik taur par nuksaan pahunchaa dete hai to aapkaa dimag uske aage kuch soch nahin paata or aapkaa gussa khud-ba-khud shant hone lagata he
 Not only that, you feel a kind of mental satisfaction that i slapped him
 yah maansik santosh aapke bheetar ke gusse ko pighla detaa he
 The release of hormones that increase anger in you decreases and anger starts to calm down
 ’doctor gore kaa kahana he, ‘thappad maarane se gussa khatm jarur ho jaataa he magar hameshaa is upaay kaa istemaal nahin karnaa chahie
 This is the last resort to get angry
 agar aap kisi choti si baat par naaraaz hokar thappad maarenge to baat or bigadegi
 So try to use it at a time when you are feeling a sense of violence instead of anger, that is, do not use it for any normal anger
 ’doctor tyaagi kaa kahana he, ‘jab ham gusse main hote hai to hamaare bheetar rakt sanchaar kii gati bad jaati he
 If we can control it at that time, then anger will come out automatically
 gusse main kisi ko maaraa gaya thappad yahi kaam karata he
 It reduces the speed of blood circulation of our body and our anger subsides
 ’gussa sabhi ke liye nuksaandeh he
 Therefore, never be angry for too long
 magar hameshaa gussa khatm karne ke liye thappad kaa istemaal bhi nahin karnaa chahie kyonki jo kaam pyaar kar saktaa he vah thappad nahin kar saktaa
 So unless your anger is in extreme condition, it is better not to use slap

 court ne is maamle main centre sarkaar se bhi jawaab maanga he
 It has been said in the petition that restaurants cannot charge more than 18 per cent tax but restaurants are charging 33 to 46 per cent tax
 sarkaar isliye chup he kyonki sarkaar ko bhi iskaa ek hissaa mil jaataa he
 But the consumer has to bear the burden of all this
 1 hajaar rupee ke khaane par restaurant 400 se 500 rupee tex ke rup me vasuul rahaa he
 The petition argues that VAT is imposed only on the content
 jo bill kaa saath pratishat hota he
 The remaining 40 percent is service
 us par waite nahin liya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, the Delhi government should be directed to take appropriate action against all the restaurants

 "silence" Bihari Babu
 
 
 ye kahana he, bhartiya janata party yuva morcha ke kuch netaaon kaa jinhone patna ke jepi golmber par guuruuvaar ko ek binar lagaakar aupchaarik rup se party ke varisht netaa or patna sahib se saansad shatrughna sinha ke khilaaf karrwai karne kii maang kii
 In the banner-poster which was put in it, it was written that the demand of us workers is that Shatrughan Sinha should also be "silenced"
 or usamen ek pankti ye bhi jodi gai ki kirti azaad ke baad shatrughna sinha kii baari he
 And it was also a coincidence that Bihari Babu, who was always in discussion to disappear from Patna city, was in Patna on Thursday and when the reporters asked him, his reply was "when you get into politics, stones are thrown at you
" But this could not be an official poster posted by the party and he advised the media in reverse to inquire a little about the poster
 Whether you are in the party or not
 
 And the whole matter is not being done to get publicity
 jab unase bhartiya janata party ke netaaon ke us bayaan ke bare main poocha gaya jisamen unhone daawa kiya tha ki bihar main jangalraj kii vaapasi ho gai he to bihari babu kaa jawaab tha "khamosh"
 
 
 The comments ye bhi ek sanyog tha ki jab ye sara drama chal rahaa tha us samay bihar bijepi ke sabhi varisht netaa party daftar ke baahar rajya sarkaar ke khilaaf dharne par baithe the
 
 
 In fact, the Leader of the Opposition in the Bihar Legislative Assembly, Prem Kumar, has gone on a 24-hour hunger strike in support of which all senior leaders of the entire party reached the dharna site
 lekin na unhone bihari babu ko bulaane kii jarurat samajhi or na shatrughna sinha ne patna main hone ke baavjood dharna main shaamil hone kii aupchaarikta nibhaai
 Although there have been posters against Bihari Babu in Patna city earlier also, people in those poster banners used to complain that they are missing from their parliamentary constituency
 haalanki unke najdiki logon kaa kahana he ki aise binar poster se unke tevar naram hone kii ummid rakhana shaayad sambhav nahin or aane vaale dinon main wo aise bayanon kii sankhya jisase party kii pareshaani badhati ho agar badha den to aashcharya nahin hoga

 Krishna aka James Bandh used to wear a shirt written by 007 with the hand of Delhi Police
 When the incident took place, he used to wear a shirt written on 007 when he went out to rob the streets
 wo ise apni lucky shart maanata tha, lekin 12 taarikh ko krishna urf james band kaa lack kaam nahin kiya or wo apni lucky shart ke saath hi giraftaar ho gaya
 The case is of Dwarka district of Delhi
 police ke mutabik, ek team banaai gai thi jo un badmaashon par najar rakh rahi thi jo street krime main shaamil rahete hai or din ke vakt main logon ke bich main jhapatmari kar faraar ho jate the
 The police team found out that two crooks had arrived in Kakrola area with the intention of looting
 iske baad police ne un donon ko fouran hiraasat main lekar unki jaanch kii to unke paas se deshi tanmache mili
 One of them was wearing a shirt written on 007
 police ke mutabik krishna urf james band par lutpaat ke alaava katl or katl kii koshish kaa bhi cese darj he
 Apart from this, several cases have also been registered against his partner Vinod aka Tony
 police kaa kahana he ki krishna urf tony choti umr se hi lutpaat main shaamil ho gaya tha
 He was addicted to expensive cigarettes and alcohol
 ilaake main logon par dhauns jamaane ke liye isane apana naam khud hi james band rakh liya or apni shart par 007 likhva liya tha
 Used to ask people to call him only James Bond
 khaas baat ye he ki jab bhi ye kisi vaardaat ko anjaam dene nikalataa tha 007 likhi shart hi pahentaa tha
 Krishna considered his shirt extremely lucky
 ise lagata tha ki is shart main ye kabhi pakadaa nahin jayega, lekin 12 sitambar ke din krishna kaa lack kaam nahin aayaa or use police ne daboch liya

 kahanefilm kii kahani kashmir ke rahane vaale cas bhat (avinaash tiwari) or laila (tripti dimri) kii he
 Cass's father is a very big businessman and has a figure of thirty-six from Laila's father
 kahani aage badhati he to cas-laila kii mulaakaat hoti he
 Love begins to flourish between them
 jo ki paariwarik rishton ke hisaab se jaij nahin ho paata

 As soon as the names Laila and Majnu are revealed, you start seeing love all around
 lekin film dekhte vakt shaayad yah pyaar ekatarfa najar aata he
 The screenplay could be repaired

 avinaash tiwarika kaam kaaphi badhiya he

 raajnneeti ko nayaa brands dene kii baat kehane vaale rahul gandhi ab khud apni bahan priyanka ke saath nai raajnneeti kii jabaan or brands banakar ubharne kii na keval koshish kar rahe hai balki congress main jaan bhi daal rahe hai
 In the last elections, he smiled in a conversation and said, "I will bring a new brand to the politics of the country
" jaraa pratiksha karen
 Who knew that he and his sister Priyanka Vadra would gradually emerge as a new brand of politics themselves
 shaayad isliye koi ek maah tak sab kii nigahen uttar pradesh ke raibareli or amethi main tiki raheen kyonki chilchilaati dhoop, dhul or garmi main priyanka akele maa sonia gandhi or bhai rahul gandhi ke liye vot maangati raheen
 There is no philosophy, no agenda nor any heavy speech
 sirf ek apil, ''jaise aap aaj mujhe dekhne aae hai, usee tarah rahul ko vot dene baari sankhya main aaen
 i know summer is hot and it is the season of weddings, but you have to come and vote
 '' phir duusari jagah jai ho ke naaron ke bich ve kahati hai, ''yah mat sochen ki koi netaa aapako kuch dekar ehsaan karata he
 it's your right
 ''itnaa hi logon ke dilon main utarane ke liye kaaphi nahin he
 If someone wore them with a garland of flowers, they would not take it off, instead walking around in grandmother Indira Gandhi's blue, green or maroon sari in the same way as the children would walk around wearing a new custom veneer
 yadi kisi ne puch diya ki ve keval amethi-raibareli main hi kyon prachaar kar rahi hai to unka sidhaa jawaab hota, ''main yahaan keval maa or bhai ke liye prachaar karne ai hum
 i have not gone anywhere else because i am not in politics
 jab raajnneeti main nahin hum to mere liye duusari jagah jaakar prachaar karnaa thik nahin lagegaa
 But when he admitted that his face, especially his nose, resembled his grandmother's nose, then at least the BJP did not like it
 bhaajapa ke rashtriya pravaktaa ravishankar prasad ne ise saarvajanik jivan main 'nautanki' qaraar diya or kaha ki parivaar main kisi kii naak kisi duusare sadsy se milti hi hogi
 Now it is becoming a national issue
 '' prasad ne lakhanu main press se parivaar or parivaarwaad kii paribhaasha bhi kar di
 The real brother and sister turned the eyes of the entire nation towards Uttar Pradesh this time and because of them, the Congress, which had been marginalized for many years, came to life and the party's hopes started touching new heights
 jab priyanka or rahul party ke bheetar yuva peedi ke liye brands banakar ubharne lage or vipaksh main bechaini badi to congress pravaktaa virendra madan ne kaha, ''vipaksh kii ghabrahat hi is baat kaa saboot he ki rahul ji or priyanka ji teji se logon ke dimag par chaate ja rahe hai
 He is a symbol of youth power and is making himself known by his hard work, loyalty and dedication
 ''rahul apni marketing or branding apane dhang se kar rahe hai
 One night, without even noticing that the Naxalites were in awe in Odisha, on a walk in the city of Balangir, they suddenly went to the bus stand and sipped tea and chatted with the passengers
 sab dang rah gaye
 It is an old thing for Dalits to go home and stay with them and take food and Chief Minister Mayawati is so nervous that she does not live without mentioning it in her meetings
 ve ab uttar pradesh kii badahaali ke liye congress shashan kii baat karti hai or rahul par hamalaa karte hue kahati hai ki kisi dalit ke ghar jaakar kuch khaane, rukne yaa keechad main lathpath kapade vaale bachche ko god lene se daliton kaa utthan nahin hoga
 This is a spectacle
 rahul jawaab main kehete hai, ''aajkal yah fishan ban gaya he
 Whenever i go to a village, they ridicule me by saying that i go to the village, why not sit in the AC room like them
 par mere liye asli bharat gaanv hi hai
 "people of the party say that now not only Congress, the opposition has also started branding Rahul and Priyanka
 isamen bura kya he? udhar jab mayawati ne yah kahana shuru kiya ki centre uttar pradesh ke vikaas main madad nahin kar rahaa he to rahul ne barabanki kii ek sabha main kaha, ''vikaas ke liye centre se paisa to miltaa he magar suna he ki lakhanu main ek aisa hathi baitha he jo sab kuch nigal jaataa he
 "people laughed and were drowned in the thought that what happens to the money that comes from the Center under schemes like NREGA and dual-meals
 haalanki vipaksh unhen yuvaraj kahkar kataaksh karata he or khud party ke log samavet swar main rahul ko pradhanmantri ke rup main dekhnaa chaahate hai, par rahul kehete hai ki ve abhi iske liye taiyaar nahin hai
 In fact, today they are branding themselves, due to which the opposition is criticizing their efforts and is unknowingly advancing their brand and then after few days they will get frozen in the politics market
 nehru-gandhi parivaar kii muhar pehle se unke paas he hi
 Due to less rainfall in Bundelkhand, drought conditions have arisen, humans have to struggle for feed and fodder
 sankat se jujhate log ek-duusare kii madad ke liye aage aa rahe hai
 a similar view was seen in the village of Soupa in Mahoba district, where a father arrived with a straw in a bullock cart as a gift from Makar Sankranti and reached the daughter-in-law's house
 mahoba jile ke silaat gaanv ke parakshit prajapati kii beti shagun kii shaadi soopa gaanv main hui he, suman ke teen bachche hai
 The family's source of employment is farming and animal husbandry
 magar is baar sookhe kii maar ne kheton ko viraan maidan main badal diya he
 Due to lack of water, the seeds were also feared to be useless, so did not even sow
 iske chalate jaanwaron ke liye bhuse kaa sankat khadaa ho gaya he
 When his father Parikshit came to know about the absence of straw in Shagun's house, he went to the daughter's house by filling the straw in the bullock cart from Silat
 parakshit ne kaha ki vaise to makar sankranti ke maukey par mithai or fal bhejne kii parampara rahi he, magar is baar ve beti kii jarurat ko dhyaan main rakhkar bhusa lekar pahunche hai
 His son-in-law and daughter are not easy to buy husk, which is why they have come here with straw from their home
 parakshit kaa kahana he ki parivaar ke bade sadasyon kaa to kisi tarah pet bhar jayega, magar bacchon ke liye to doodh chahie hi, agar jaanavar ko bhusa nahin hoga to bacchon ko doodh kaise milegaa, isi ko dhyaan main rakhkar ve beti kii sasuraal pahunche hai
 As soon as Parikshit arrived with a cart full of straw, Shagun and her husband Ramesh's face blossomed
 unhone aapas main miljulkar baiylgaadee ko khaali karaayaa
 They know that this straw will save his animal, he has only one buffalo and his child
 sookhe main jab pet bharne ke liye ann nahin hoga, tab kisaan ke parivaar kaa sahaara yahi bhens hegi
 The comments ramesh ne bataaya ki uske maweshiyon ke khaane ke liye chaara or bhusa nahin he
 This is why his father-in-law has brought straw
 is baar usne khet main bowni tak nahin kii, yahi kaaran he ki use rojgaar kaa doosraa rasta chunanaa padaa he
 He has bought an auto by taking a loan, feeding the family with it
 bundelkhand uttar pradesh or madhya pradesh ke 13 jilon main failaa hua he
 The area has been witnessing continuous drought for the last four years
 ek taraf dane or chaare kaa sankat he to duusari ore jalstrot suukh chale hai
 Water is not able to get easily from human to animal
 yah sthiti aane vaale gambhir sankat kii ore ishaara kar rahi he
 Shagun, the daughter of Parikshit Prajapati of Silat village in Mahoba district, is married in Soupa village, Suman has three children
 parivaar kaa rojgaar kaa jariya kheti or pashupaalan he
 But this time the drought has turned the fields into deserted fields
 pani kii kami ke chalate beej ke bhi bekaar hone kii ashanka thi, isliye buvaai bhi nahin kii
 This has led to a straw crisis for animals
 shagun ke ghar main bhusa na hone kii khabar jab uske pita parakshit ko hui to ve silaat se baiylgaadee main bhusa bharkar beti kii ghar ja pahunche
 Parikshit said that although there has been a tradition of sending sweets and fruits on the occasion of Makar Sankranti, this time they have arrived with a straw keeping in mind the need of the daughter
 unke damaad or beti ko bhusa khareednaa aasaan nahin he, yahi kaaran he ki ve apane ghar se bhusa lekar yahaan aae hai
 Parikshit says that the elders of the family will somehow be fed, but the children need milk, if the animal does not have the straw, then how will the children get milk, keeping this in mind, they have reached the daughter-in-law's house 
 parakshit jaise hi bhusa se bhari baiylgaadee lekar pahunche to shagun or uske pati ramesh ke chehre khil uthe
 Together they emptied the bullock cart
 unhen pataa he ki yahi bhusa uske jaanavar ko bachaayegaa, uske paas keval ek bhens or uskaa baccha he
 When there will be no food to feed in the drought, then this will be the buffalo support of the farmer's family
 tippaniyan Ramesh said that he does not have fodder and straw for his cattle to eat
 yahi kaaran he ki uske sasur bhusa lekar aae hai
 This time he did not even sow in the field, which is why he had to choose another way of employment
 usne karj lekar auto kharida he, usee se parivaar kaa pet bhar rahaa he
 Bundelkhand is spread over 13 districts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh
 is ilaake main beete chaar varshon se lagaataar sookhaa pad rahaa he
 On one side there is a crisis of grain and fodder, on the other side the water resources have dried up
 insaan se lekar jaanavar tak ko aasaani se pani naseeb nahin ho paa rahaa he
 This situation is pointing to a serious crisis to come

 The US State Department, in its annual report 'country Report on Terrorism', said that the Indian leadership has pledged to stop the domestic terror attacks and bring terror conspiracies to justice together with the US and like-minded countries

 Some were noticed and no one paid special attention to the rest
 bhaajapa ke adwani or jetali jaise diggaj bhi sadbhaavna mishan ko gujarat se aage nahin badha paae
 The fast remained confined to the BJP and its supporters
 ho saktaa he ki ham aasaani se ullu ban jate hon, lekin phir bhi itani akl to he ki ek rajnatik anshan or teen din ke vrath main fark kar saken
 It is often believed that Indians are passionate about hunger as they associate it with religion, Mahatma Gandhi's piety and worldly politics increased this recognition, but even today, some conditions must be fulfilled to make the hunger successful
 itnaa hi kaaphi nahin he ki anshan kisi bahut bade kaam ke liye ho
 If this fast is limited to few people, then there is no justification
 rajnatik anshan tabhi safal hote hai jab samaaj kaa bada tabaka yah maanata ho ki unke mul loktantric adhikaron kii khule taur par avhelnaa ho rahi he
 The public should understand this clearly

 Suffragette, Catherine Fry, achieved prestigious status as she died while fasting for equal rights for women
 isi tarah mahatma gandhi safal hue kyonki ve aazaadee or nagarikon ke adhikaron ke liye anshan karte the
 It is for this reason that the hunger strike of Tilipan in Sri Lanka in 1987 received widespread support

 Potti Sriramalu died on the 82nd of his fast in 1952 to make Andhra Pradesh bilingual, from Hyderabad to Chennai
 agar in shoorveeron ko aaj yaad kiya jaataa he to vah sirf isliye kyonki inke andolan main paardarshita thi
 Trickster governments openly violate democratic rights and give legitimacy to those who go on hunger strikes

 Swami Nigamananda passed away without any fame because his desire to clean the Ganges could not be presented as a democratic right

 durbhagyavash pheruman ke andolan ne thode-se logon ko aakarshith kiya, ise adhikaar kaa nahin balki nitigat maamla kaha ja saktaa tha
 There is bound to be a hunger strike on any issue which is unclear and which can be interpreted in many ways
 anshan karne vaale agar chaahate hai ki unki aswabhaavik or tanha maut na ho to unhen yah baat dimag main rakhni chahie
 What happened to Fateh Singh and Tara Singh
 unke baar-baar hone vaale anshan jaldi hi janata ke liye majaak ban gaye
 Half-hearted hunger strikes create the impression that Indians are easy to go on hunger strike and cunning politicians take full advantage of it
 jaisaaki ham dekhte hai, yah baat puri tarah sach nahin he
 If Anna Hazare is on one side, there are many fake Gandhians on the other side
 anna kaa anshan is nazariye se safal rahaa ki unhone dikhaa diya ki unki ladaai desh ke nagarikon ke liye he
 There is corruption in every corner of India, even an ostrich-filled cabinet cannot eradicate it

 But the need is that there should be a strong law which the people can call their law

 From start to finish, his fast was directed and air-conditioned
 sabase ahm ki koun-se aise hanan hue loktantric adhikaar the, jinhen ve behaal karne kii koshish kar rahe the
 Beating the fast, but ignoring his issue is similar to the Joker's game after the circus is over

 PM Modi's love and dedication to Devbhoomi Uttarakhand is well known
 yahi vajah he ki unhone pichley chah maah main teen baar uttarakhand kaa daura kiya
 In particular, he has great faith in Baba Kedar
 ab kedarnath kshetra kaa vikaas unke liye aasthaa kaa centre ban gaya he
 Prime Minister Modi Baba had arrived for a visit at the opening of Kedar's kapat, where he had seen Kedarnagri completely
 tabhi unhone kedarngari ko sundar or bhavy banane kaa khaakaa apane man main khinch liya tha
 After this, he also came to see at the time of the closure of Kedarnath
 is baar piem modi ne spasht taur par nirdesh die gaye ki kaise kedarpuri ke liye dekhe gaye unke sapane ko puraa karnaa he
 Due to this, the entire government was seen in tremendous action during Modi's recent visit

 iske saath hi monitering ke liye drone kaa intjaam karne ke bhi nirdesh mukhya sachiv ne die hai
 These instructions given to work according to the expectations of PM Modi were given to leveling the land behind the Kedarnath temple and developing it as a park by scrapping the land

 No one is as easy as breaking the relationship and no one can understand the heartache that follows
 aksar jab koi rishta tuutata he to uske peeche koi na koi thos vajah jarur hoti he
 But sometimes the relationship is broken, it is not known
 kahin aap bhi bevajaah apnerishte ko todnemen to nahin lage hue hai
 If something similar is going on in your mind, then give your relationship a chance once before breaking up
 apane man or dimag main chal rahi uthal puthal ko jane or shant hokar sochen ki kya aap sach main brallep karnaa chaahate hai? brallep karne kii koi thos vajah he bhi yaa nahin
 
 
 Some tips will help in solving your mind confusion
 brallep karne se pehle jaane ye 5 baaten
 
 
 1
 kya vah aapako time nahin dete?kisi bhi rishte main taazgi banaaen rakhane kaek hi tarika haiekadusre ko bharpoor samay dena
 Your time is more than any precious gift for your partner, who can give them happiness all over the world
 agar aapkaa partner aapke saath samay bitaane ko betaab rahata he to phir aap lucky hai kyonki samay se keemtee kuch nahin
 Do not even let such a dear companion know by mistake
 2
 Do they not respect you? Another important reason for breaking up is lack of respect for each other
 lekin aapke rishte main agar aapkaa partner aapako, aapke kaam ko or aapse jude har insaan ko sammaan detaa he to phir aapako aise rishte ko khatm karne se pehle ek baar soch lenaa chahie
 3
 kya vah aapako dhokhaa de rahe hai?kisi bhi rishte mempyar, sammaan ke saathhi vishwaas kaa hona bhi bahut jaruri he
 If your partner tells you all their truths and lies
 unhone abhi tak aapako kisi bhi tarah ke dhokhe main nahin rakhaa he to aapako brallep se pehle koi or thos vajah dhundhani chahie
 4
 kahin aapkaa maansik tanaav to nahin ban rahaa vajah?kai baar ham samaj nahin pate ki hamaara maansik tanaav hamaare achche chal rahe rishte ko khatm karne kii vajah ban jaataa he
 If you get angry at your partner unnecessarily
 aap baat bebaat un par baras padate hai or vah pyaar se aapaki har baat sunate-samajhate hai to yah rishta aapaki jindagi kaa sabase acha tohfa he ise tode nahin balki sahej len
 5
 kahin aap vikalp to nahin talash rahe?insaan kii fitrat badi kharaab hoti he
 Even if everything is going well in life, we still feel something empty
 kai baar partner ke saath tuning match nahin hoti yaa phir aapaki aadaten alag hoti hai, pasand-naapnsad ek si nahin hoti lekin iskaa matlab ye nahin ki aap vikalp talashne lagen
 People of two different natures often become the best couple
 apane pyaare se rishte ko sanjokar rakhen
 Avoid spoiling your own moments of unnecessary life by getting into unnecessary stress or talk

 (input bhashaa se) (from input language) isisi world cap ke final ke nattejey main ben stokes kaa ahm role rahaa
 The 28-year-old all-rounder brought England to life with the help of his bat that the English team made history by winning the World Cup for the first time
 ravivaar ko aitihaasik lords main ben stokes ke 98 gendon main naabad 84 ran unhen match vijeta sabit karte hai
 But on the fourth ball of the last over, such a 'reduction' occurred, which could change the picture of the match
 jab england ko jeet ke liye 3 gendon par 9 ranon kii jarurat thi or aakhri over kii chauthi gend par stokes out ho gaye hote
 The story of the finale would have been different
 ben stokes kaa VIDEO dekhne ke liye yahaan clic karendrasal, stokes ne match kaa aakhri over phenk rahe trent bolt kii chauthi gend par, jo phultos thi, midwicket kii ore joardaar shot lagaaya
 During the second run, Martin Guptill's direct throw could have been on the wicket - if Stokes would not have stopped the throw with his bat while diving, which later went over the boundary with his hand and the total on this ball
 Got 6 (2 + 4) runs
 isi ran ke baad england kii team khud ko super over kii sthiti tak laa pai
 The Super Over was later tied and England became World Champion on a boundary basis
 ab sawaal uthta he ki kya stokes ne ran out se bachane ke liye aisa kiya

 ? lekin dharmasena ne stokes ko out dene kii jagah apni ungliyaan ginate hue 6 ranon kaa ishaara kar diya
 What is the rule of Obstructing the field? In most cases this obstruction is considered when the batsman thinks that he is about to run out and he stops the ball with his bat or blocks the ball for wickets
 Changing his way, running between yah obstruction jaanboojhkar kiya gaya ho, to ballebaaj nishchit taur par out diya jayega
 If the batsman has inadvertently approached the ball, he will not be out
 stokes ke maamle ko dekhen, to pataa chalata he ki unhone ran out se bachane ke liye jaanboojhkar thro ko apane balle se nahin roka tha
 After this, Stokes wanted to raise both his hands - 'I did nothing intentionally
 ' newjiland kii ore se bhi koi apil nahin kii gai thi

 After all, why did Arvinder Singh Lovely who joined BJP from Congress only 9 months ago become disenchanted with BJP so soon? This is the question that everyone wants to know
 kaaphi samay se sikh chehre ko talash rahi bijepi ke liye purvi dilli kaa ye diggaj netaa kaaphi ahm tha
 Earlier, RP Singh is present as the Sikh face in Delhi for BJP
 lekin wo bhi itnaa bada naam nahin hai or chunaav bhi haar chuke hai
 At the same time, Arvinder Singh never lost from Gandhinagar seat, but people watching the 'organization' in BJP could not handle Lovely
 lavali ke kareebi bataate hai ki unki congress main vaapasi ke peeche yahi ek badi vajah rahi
 According to sources, some BJP leaders did not lag behind Arvinder Singh Lovely to show that he is an outsider
 vahiin, congress ke is bade kad ke netaa ko bijepi main koi bada kaam nahin saunpa gaya
 It is of course that he was called in important party meetings, but never got his preference there
 bijepi main unhen apane raajnneetik bhavishya kii tasviir bhi saaf nahin dikh rahi thi
 Arvinder Singh Lovely was already in his unhappiness within the BJP
 is bich bijepi main ek aisa vakya hua, jisane lavali ko andar tak jhakzor diya
 Which made him think that he is not counted in the BJP
 isi dauraan sanyog se congress leadership kii taraf se unki 'ghar vaapasi' kii pahal bade str par kii gai to unhone bhi 'haath' ko lapakane main bilkul deree nahin kii
 Actually, after the completion of three years of Kejriwal government, BJP called a meeting regarding the failures and strategy of Arvind Kejriwal government
 isamen dilli bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari ke alaava vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa vijendra gupta, party ke ek purv pradesh adhyaksh, teenon mahaamantri or sanghathan mantri ko bhi rahanaa tha
 But when he arrived at the Delhi BJP office to attend the meeting, there was no one but two General Ministers and Organization Minister
 arvinder singh ko baad main pataa chalaa ki pradesh adhyaksh ko to is ahm meeting kii jaankaree tak nahin thi
 Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Vijender Gupta also came late
 sanghathan mantri lavali ko yah kahkar chalate bane ki abhi vah donon mahaamantriyon se charchaa kar 'shwet patr' kaa masauda taiyaar kar len, baad main us par anya varisht netaaon kii bhi raay le lee jaaegi
 The two general ministers with whom Lovely was left for a meeting, both of them stand nowhere in front of Lovely in terms of political stature and experience
 isse lavali kaaphi aahat hue or kisi tarah jald hi meeting nipataakar vahaan se nikal gaye
 This was the incident that hurt him
 ajay maakan se naaraaz hokar bijepi main shaamil hudervinder singh lavaliis baat se bhi kaaphi aahat the ki unhen bijepi adhyaksh se baat karne ke liye bhi kaaphi jaddojahad kerani padati thi
 When Lovely had to talk to the party president, his PA had to call
 dilli bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari zyaadaatar maukon par phone nahin uthaate the
 But as soon as a little rumor started about him in the Congress, he thought it better to go to the Congress than BJP

 In these five years, Naxalites never came forward for talks
 naksaliyon kaa to sashastr kranti main vishwaas he or usee ke jariye vah sarkaron ko palatnaa chaahate hai
 He said that the Union Home Minister has talked about taking a balanced approach to tackle the Naxal problem, in which priority has been given to security, development, social welfare and access of government schemes to Naxal areas
 magar naksaliyon kaa to vikaas kaaryon main vishwaas hi nahin he
 He said that in the last three years, along with the demolition of 163 school buildings in Bihar, hundreds of JCB machines engaged in road construction work were burnt and by extortion from construction agencies, the Naxalites have rejected the development works, then the state government development How to speed up work susheel ne kaha ki rajya sarkaar ko yah bhi bataanaa chaiye ki naksaliyon ke liye usne jo samarpan evam punarvaas package banaaya tha uske tahat kitne naksaliyon ne aatmasamarpan kiya or sarkaar kii yah yojana vifal kyon rahi
 Sushil Kumar Modi said that the Bihar government should tell whether it will withdraw the anti-naxal special squad and paramilitary forces from the Naxal areas, ignoring the suggestion of formation of a special police force on the lines of the Gray Hound of Andhra Pradesh
 kya nirdosho kii hatya par bhi sarkaar mookadarshak bani rahegi
 He said whether the Bihar government would boycott any such meeting called next time after being reprimanded by the central government for not taking soft and effective action against the Naxalites
 susheel ne aarope lagaaya ki bihar sarkaar kii narmi or vot bank va chunaavon main madad ke liye naksaliyon ko mahima mandit karne kii vajah se hi pradesh ke 38 main se 33 jilon main naksaliyon ko paanv pasaarne main madad mili he
 He claimed that due to Naxalites, the Speaker of Bihar Legislative Assembly is in danger of his life and he is unable to muster the courage to go to his constituency
 susheel ne kaha ki haal main purvi champaran ke mehsi ke nikat malgadee ko visphot se udaane ke saath hi naksali lagaataar hinsaatmak ghatnaon ko anjaam dene main bhi safal ho rahe hai
 He said that in the year 2013, where there was a decrease in Naxalite violence in the entire country, Bihar had increased by 41 percent
 puure desh main police se naksaliyon ne jo hathiyaar luute hai unamem 62 pratishat hathiyaar bihar sarkaar se luute gayi hai
 In such a situation, the statement of the government is going to fall the morale of the security forces deployed in Naxalite areas
 bihar ke mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ne vaicharik rup se asahmati jataate hue kaha tha ki bandook kii madad se naksalwad kaa hal nahin nikaala ja saktaa balki hamen iske peeche ke kaarnon kaa pataa lagaana hoga tathaa ek maatr hal samaaj ke chahumunkhi vikaas main he
 He had said that Naxalism has come to the fore with frustration over lack of employment and socio-economic-educational development as well as non-availability of justice among weaker sections
 iskaa hal sirf vikaas main hi he
 Manjhi had said that former Chief Minister Nitish Kumar attempted to resolve the Maoism issue in the state and started development work for the deprived people to tackle it
 unhone kaha ki is niti se vastav main madad mili or rajya main sthiti itani badal gayi he ki hamaare maovadiyon bhaaiyon ko nae logon kii talash main kathinaayee ho rahi he
 The youth do not want to join them
 vikaas logon ko naksalwad se dur karata he
 Manjhi had said that our intention is to develop so much in Bihar that a problem like Naxalism can be resolved automatically
 agar ham garib kii jhopadiyon tak vikaas pahunchaate hai to isse naksalwad nishchit rup se samaapt ho jayega

 Indian team bowling coach Bharat Arun feels that left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja got a chance to understand and improve his game which he is now benefiting from when he is out of the national team for a few months
 jadeja ne ab tak team ke spin vibhaag ke agua ravichandran aswin kaa acha saath diya he
 Both of them have taken 12–12 wickets in the four-test series against South Africa so far
 jadeja hamaara ‘banker’ gendbatorun ne duusare din kaa khel barish kii bhent chadh jane ke baad kaha, ‘meraa maananaa he ki use yah jaanane ke liye samay mila ki use kin vibhaagon main sudhaar karnaa he
 His performance in the Ranji Trophy (more than 30 wickets from Saurashtra) also boosted his confidence
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘iske saath hi jadeja hamaara ‘banker’ gendbaaj he
 You can play in any format whether it is Test or ODI
 vah apane phaayde ke liye apane majboot pakshon kaa upyog karnaa jaanata he
 While Jadeja assessed his game, the coach said that Bhuvneshwar Kumar "needs to swing the ball more" although he is happy that he is bowling faster than before
 arun ne ranjai trophy khilne ke liye bheje gaye uttar pradesh ke tej gendbaaj ke bare main kaha, ‘bhubaneshwar kumaar kii baat karen to vah 140 kimi se adhik kii raftaar se gend kar saktaa he or use swing bhi kara saktaa he
 Bhuvi's strong side is his swing
 usne apni teji kuch badhaayi he lekin use lagaataar adhik swing karne kii jarurat he or lagaataar kaam karne se vah isamen safal bhi ho jayega
 Arun, who has been associated with the National Cricket Academy for many years, believes that there is a good reserve pool of fast bowlers in the country but they need the right guidance
 hamaare paas gendbaajon kaa acha poolunhone kaha, ‘abhi kisi ke naam kaa zikr karnaa anuchit hoga lekin hamaare paas gendbaajon kaa acha pool he
 We need to guide them to the best of their ability
 ’ ishanth ke ection main badlaav ke baad sudhaar ke bare main arun ne kaha ki asal main dilli kaa yah tej gendbaaj ab sahi kone se gendbaaji kar rahaa he jisase use safalataa mil rahi he
 He said, 'to be honest, there was not much change in his action
 hamane unhen unke gend karne ke kone se avgat karaayaa or bataaya ki koun se kone se gend karne par unhen safalataa mil sakati he
 Once they know this, they can use their skills better
 ’is purv bhartiya madhyam gati ke gendbaaj se poocha gaya ki kya terning wicket taiyaar karne se bharat main tej gendbaajon ke vikaas main baadha utpann hogi, unhone kaha, ‘main isse sahamat nahin hum
 We have good fast bowlers in India
 hamaare paas abhi chaar aise gendbaaj hai jo lagaataar 140 kimi se adhik kii raftaar se gendbaaji kar sakate hai
 We like to play on wickets that are compatible with our team's strategies
 yah (chinnaswami) spinneron kaa madadgaar wicket nahin he balki yah acha wicket he
 On the one-day game in the match being rained down, Arun said, "there is a lot of time left in this Test match
 ham ballebaaji main satr dar satr par dhyaan denge
 We would like to raise our upper hand with a good score

 rohit sharma ko lekar beete kai saalon main jab-tab ye charchaa hoti he ki unhen zyada maukey die ja rahe hai
 Everyone has been considering him as a talent, who has been wasting his chances
 talented ballebaaz kaa slogan to kuch aisa chipka ki khud rohit sharma ne bhi kaha ki talented hone ke chakkar main unka nuksaan zyada hua he jabaki ve apni mehnat se ballebaaj bane hai or number aath ballebaaz se number ek tak pahunche hai
 However, the biggest reason for these discussions is that Rohit Sharma missed on important occasions
 set hone ke baad apni pari ko badi pari main tabdeel nahin karne kii ichhashakti nahin dikhaate or to or acha bhala ballebaaji karte hue kharaab shats khel kar wicket ganvaa dete hai
 Despite all this, why Rohit Sharma is special, he once again showed it at the Green Park Stadium in Kanpur
 dakshin africa ke 304 ranon ke lakshya ke saamne rohit sharma ne behtareen andaaj main pari kii shuruyaat kii or uske baad unhone apane andaaj main ran batore
 He scored an eighth century in his ODI career
 haalanki iske liye unhone 139 vanade khele hai
 Now compare it with Hashim Amla, who has scored 21 centuries in 121 odis
 is lihaaj se dekhen to rohit sharma ke shatakon kaa graph kahin behatar hona chahie, lekin unki ballebaazi kii sabase khaas baat ye he ki jab ve ballebaazi kar rahe hote hai, to kisi bhi gendbaazi akraman ko ausat bana dete hai
 However, he has to prove his ability on foreign pitches
 baavjood iske jab ve lay main hote hai, to kisi fankaar kii bhaanti ran batorte najar aate hai
 The comments unhen sahajata se tufaani shats khelte hue dekhne se lagata he ki ye ballebaaj to out hi nahin hoga
 If Rohit starts giving his 100 percent in his hard work, practice and commitment, then it is also possible
 yahi wo pahalu hai, jiske chalate rohit sharma vanade cricket main do dohare shatak ke baad bhi star ballebaazon main apni jagah majbooti se jamaa nahin paae hai
 However, he does not look very far from them and he also has time
 haalanki in charchaaon kii sabase badi vajah yahi he ki rohit sharma ahm maukon par chookte rahe
 After being set, they do not show the will to not convert their innings into big innings and then batting well and losing wickets by playing bad shots
 in sabake baavjood rohit sharma khaas kyon hai, ye unhone kanpur ke green park stadium main ek baar phir dikhaa diya
 Rohit Sharma started the innings in the best style in front of South Africa's target of 304 runs and after that he scored runs in his style
 dekhte-dekhte unhone apane vanade kariyar kaa aathvaan shatak bana diya
 However, he has played 139 odis for this
 ab jaraa isaki tulana hashim amala se bhi kar lijie, jinhone 121 vanade maichon main 21 shatak thoke hai
 In this sense, the graph of Rohit Sharma's centuries should be much better, but the most important thing about his batting is that when he is batting, any bowling attack makes an average
 haalanki videshi pichon par unhen apni kaabiliyat sabit kerani he
 Despite this, when they are in rhythm, they are seen scoring runs like a funk
 tippaniyan Seeing them play stormy shots effortlessly, it seems that this batsman will not be out
 agar apni mehnat, practice or patibaddhta main rohit apana shat pratishat dene lage to ye sambhav bhi he
 This is the aspect due to which Rohit Sharma has not been able to consolidate his place in the star batsmen even after two double centuries in ODI cricket
 haalanki vah unase bahut dur bhi nahin dikhataa or unke paas samay bhi maujuud he
 Despite all this, why Rohit Sharma is special, he once again showed it at the Green Park Stadium in Kanpur
 dakshin africa ke 304 ranon ke lakshya ke saamne rohit sharma ne behtareen andaaj main pari kii shuruyaat kii or uske baad unhone apane andaaj main ran batore
 He scored an eighth century in his ODI career
 haalanki iske liye unhone 139 vanade khele hai
 Now compare it with Hashim Amla, who has scored 21 centuries in 121 odis
 is lihaaj se dekhen to rohit sharma ke shatakon kaa graph kahin behatar hona chahie, lekin unki ballebaazi kii sabase khaas baat ye he ki jab ve ballebaazi kar rahe hote hai, to kisi bhi gendbaazi akraman ko ausat bana dete hai
 However, he has to prove his ability on foreign pitches
 baavjood iske jab ve lay main hote hai, to kisi fankaar kii bhaanti ran batorte najar aate hai
 The comments unhen sahajata se tufaani shats khelte hue dekhne se lagata he ki ye ballebaaj to out hi nahin hoga
 If Rohit starts giving his 100 percent in his hard work, practice and commitment, then it is also possible
 yahi wo pahalu hai, jiske chalate rohit sharma vanade cricket main do dohare shatak ke baad bhi star ballebaazon main apni jagah majbooti se jamaa nahin paae hai
 However, he does not look very far from them and he also has time
 dekhte-dekhte unhone apane vanade kariyar kaa aathvaan shatak bana diya
 However, he has played 139 odis for this

 yah to main thik-thik nahin bataa saktaa ki raajnneeti se meraa parichay kab hua
 i come from that disadvantaged section, where awareness of discrimination comes from childhood
 ho saktaa he yah tab kii baat ho, jab main hof pant pahentaa tha or un ladakon kii tarah hona chahta tha jo phul pant pahante hai
 Or it may be that when i saw people going to the saloon where they would be seated on the throne like a king while i cut my hair under the tree
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki iskaa pataa mujhe maa ke garbh main hi chal gaya ho or vah jo khaanaa khaati thi, uskaa pataa samaaj main uske saamaajik-aarthik darje se lagata tha
 My political consciousness was settled before my birth
 log mujhase poochhate hai ki kya jail main bitaye dinon ke baad mujhe ehsaas ho gaya he ki vastav main aazaadee kya hoti he
 But i have found that the world outside the prison cell i came out of is like a big prison
 bhartiya hone ke naate aazaadee kii hamaari dharna samvidhan se aati he
 At its core is a preface, which lists the guiding principles of sovereignty, equality, justice and fraternity on which the government should be run
 hamaara sangharsh rajya ke bheetar rahete hue aazaadee kii ladaai he
 There are very simple demands like equality in employment opportunities, men and women, right to education, justice, etc
 and it should be accessible to all, rather than being snatched from one hand and put in the other

 Social hegemony is perhaps the biggest curse of our society
 peshey ke hisaab se bani pahchaan par aadhaarit is oonch-neech kaa strot manusmriti he
 Manuwad means the belief that your past actions affect your rebirth
 yahi vah atapata vichaar he jiske hisaab se mana jaataa he ki kuch log to raaj karne ke liye hai, jabaki duusare unki gulaami karne ke liye paidaa hue hai
 We are fighting against this

 The Nepalese government's order, from the national anthem to social media to Parliament before the Aarti, has led to a controversy over the order of the Nepal government to play the national anthem before the Aarti, asking the committee to reconsider the decision

 a large number of devotees take part in it
 baagmati aarti parivaar pichley 12 varshon se aarti kaa aayojan kar rahi he

 Pakistan's nuclear scientist AQ Khan believes that he worked for Pakistan by making atomic bombs, but the 'army that benefited the most from his work stabbed him in the back'
 ’pakistani sena se ‘vishesh pension’ paa rahe khan ne tark diya he ki bharat or pakistan ke bich 1971 ke baad se yuddh nahin hua he kyonki donon deshon ke paas parmaanu pratirohak kshamta he or donon parmaanu hathiyaaron ke istemaal ke parinaamon se avgat hai
 He said in an interview to Germany's Der Spiegel magazine, "nuclear weapons are not being used because both countries know that the other side can respond
" ’ is baat par jor dete hue ki europe main parmaanu pratirohakata ke kaaran 1945 se koi yuddh nahin hua he, unhone kaha ki yahi baat ‘bharat or pakistan ke liye bhi 1971 ke baad se sach he
 Khan said, "kargil's War (1999) was of local scale and the issue of use of nuclear weapons never arose
 ham bhole ho sakate hai, par ham murkh nahin hai
 Both sides know what the consequences can be
 ’ khan se poocha gaya tha ki kya bharat or pakistan ke bich kaa parmaanu yuddh koi ek desh jeet saktaa he
 In 2004, Khan admitted that he was secretly running a nuclear proliferation network, after which he was placed under house arrest
 unhone tivi par saarvajanik taur par sweekaar kiya tha ki unhone laabh ke liye parmaanu takanic bechi
 In response to a question asked about this, he said, 'I took sole responsibility for the entire development because the political leadership had asked me to do it immediately
 ’khan ne kaha, ‘purv sainya shaasha general parvej musharraf ne mujhe maafee dene or punarvaas karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 But a few days later, a mess started with me and he started talking about a conditional apology, the result of which is well known
 ’ yah puche jane par ki kya unhen mahasoos hota he ki unke saath chaal chali gai, unhone kaha, ‘chaal kaa shikaar hona sahi shabd nahin hoga
 i think that every man who benefited from my work stabbed me in the back, for example the military
 ’unase poocha gaya ki kya unhen parmaanu bam banane kaa khed he, unhone jawaab diya, ‘mujhe ab bhi lagata he ki maine pakistan ke liye bada kaam kiya
 Khan claimed that Pakistan was forced to make nuclear weapons due to India's nuclear tests and political aggression
 ’khan se poocha gaya ki pichley maheene karachi main nausena ke hawaii pratishthan par aatankwaadiyon ke hamale ke baad kya pakistan ke parmaanu hathiyaar surakshit hai, unhone kaha, ‘yah puraa ho-hallaa pashchim dwaara machaaya gaya he
 Our nuclear weapons were neither a threat, nor will there be any further
 ’khaas taur par libya, iran or uttar korea jaise deshon ke saath parmaanu prasar ke vyapaar main shaamil hone ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha, ‘main prasar main lipt nahin tha or ‘e kyuu khan network’ jaisi koi cheez he hi nahin
 Khan claimed that international suppliers are willing to sell goods to every person who wants to buy and they do not need me for this

 Their parties flew off and became orphans
 unke paas kii sabase badi dharohar chhin gai
 One of such leaders is Ajit Singh, who enjoyed the power with great pleasure on the basis of his father Chaudhary Charan Singh's legacy and his caste
 kendra main chaahe kisi bhi party kii sarkaar rahe, ajit singh apni party ke mutthi bhar saansadon ke bal par mantri banate rahe
 He was considered the top leader of his caste in the Jat dominated areas of western Uttar Pradesh
 us ilaake main unke pita swa
 Charan Singh's name is still taken with respect
 choudhary charan singh sachche kisaan netaa the or unhone unke bhale ke liye kai kadam uthaae
 He always raised his voice to get the farmers the right price for their produce
 gramin parivesh ke hote hue bhi unhone apane bete ajit singh ko ucch shiksha paane ke liye videsh bheja
 Ajit Singh pursued higher education in engineering and felt that he would do something in this field as per his father's wish
 lekin ajit singh ne ek aasaan sa rasta chunaa jisamen prasiddhi bhi thi or paisa bhi
 He formed a party called Rashtriya Lok Dal
 vah saansad bane, mantri bane or kai baar chunaav jite
 It was very easy for him to contest elections because he dominated the people of his caste
 haalat yah rahi ki unhone videsh main padhe bete ko bhi raajnneeti main utaar diya
 But this time the riots in western Uttar Pradesh lost their support base
 haalat itani buree tha ki unhen or unke bete ko lok sabha chunaav buree haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 It seemed that his political retirement had taken place
 lekin ab unhone charan singh ke naam kaa mohara phir phenkaa he
 This time he has resorted to cheap politics
 jis shandaar bangale main vah 30 saal thaath se rahete aae use ve paraajay ke baad khaali karne ko taiyaar nahin the
 He felt that emptying it would damage his reputation
 isliye unhone us bangale ko charan singh kaa smarak banane kii maang karke pashchimi uttar pradesh main ek andolan shuru karvaa diya
 He wants to kill two birds with one stone
 ek taraf to us shandaar bangale par kabja or duusari taraf jaaton ke voton ko apni ore karnaa
 The Jats who had gone away from them, they should return to their camp and they got a sitting issue
 unhone is mudde ko hawa deni shuru kar di he
 They are working on tricks ranging from Delhi Chalo to threatening not to give water to Delhi
 halki raajnneeti kaa yah behtareen udhaaharan he
 Surprisingly, Charan Singh is going to be almost 29 years old today, but Ajit Singh never felt that a big memorial should be built in his memory
 unki prasiddhi or unke sukarmon kii vajah se ve aaj yahaan tak pahunche lekin unhone apane pita kii yaad main kuch aisa nahin kiya
 It obviously cost them their own money
 aise main sarkari kharch se smarak banavaane main unhen hichak nahin
 This is another example of person worship in India
 sarkaar ko is tarah kii maang nahin manani chahie
 By doing this, such demand will continue to come forward

 It is believed that drinking energy drinks increases the ability to work
 yah sahi bhi ho saktaa he, lekin ek chaunkaane vaali baat yah he ki kam umr main energy drink lenaa naa sirf aapako biimaar bana saktaa he balki isse aapaki maut bhi ho sakati he
 Yes, there have been some such instances in the UK, in which the latest case is of Joshua Maric, a rugby player

 Then his father had said that Marik went to sleep in his room that night as usual, but he did not wake up the next morning
 maric kii maut kii jaanch kar rahi team ne haal hi bataaya ki maric ek hai caffeine energy drink lene kaa aadi tha or sambhav he ki usee ke asar se uski maut ho gai ho
 The doctor who examined the toxicology of Maric's body has also confirmed that energy drinks could be a reason behind his death
 yah mahaj ek udhaaharan he
 There are many cases of doctors coming to the UK in the day, in which youth are coming with headaches, stomach pain, sleepiness, restlessness and sometimes severe problems
 doctoron ke anusaar aise yuvaaon main adhiktar hai caffin energy drink lene ke aadi hote hai
 Kya says according to expert experts, a can of high energy drink usually contains 13 teaspoons of sugar and the same amount of caffeine in the ratio of two cups of coffee
 yah maatra kisi bhi yuva sharir or dimag ke liye khatra paidaa karne vaala ho saktaa he
 Generally, youth drink 3-4 cans of energy drink a day
 isamen lagbhag 640 migra caffeine kii maatra hoti he, jabaki ek vayask ko bhi ek din main sirf 400 migra caffeine lene kii hidaayat di jaati he
 The rules regarding the amount of caffeine in a drink should be Dr
 of the Journal of Caffeine Research
 jaik james kehete hai, 'caffeine kii maatra par bhi cigarette or alcohol kii tarah pabandi honi chahie
 Although caffeine drink is taken like an ordinary drink in our society, one should be aware of its quantity
 varanaa iske ghaatak parinaam ho sakate hai
 According to the activists who are running camp on energy drinks, the administration should fix the age limit on such energy drinks
 bacchon main bad rahaa chidchidapaningland main association of skool and college leaders ke general secretary bryan kehete hai, 'skool main aise kai bachche aate hai jo din kii shuruyaat naashtaa karne kii bajaay energy drink lekar karte hai
 Irritability is clearly visible in the behavior of such children
 yahi nahin, aise bachche aam taur par ek jagah shanti se baithna pasand nahin karte or kisi bhi kaam main dhyaan nahin laga pate hai
 According to a similar survey on energy drinks in the US in 2011, excessive intake of caffeine leads to seizures and ecstasy as well as death
 visheshgyon ke anusaar, log aam taur par ise soft drink kii tarah maanate hai, jabaki aisa nahin he
 The amount of caffeine in energy drinks directly affects the brain, so there should be strict restriction on its consumption at a young age
 waisi kavita jo man ko andolit kar de or uski gunj saalon tak sunai de
 This is rarely seen in Hindi poems
 kuch kavi janakavi hote hai to kuch ko rashtrakavi kaa darja miltaa he magar ek kavi rashtrakavi bhi ho or janakavi, yah izzat bahut hi kam kaviyon ko naseeb ho paati he
 Ramdhari Singh Dinkar is one of such poets whose poems are as much loved by an illiterate farmer as by a scholar who researches them
 dinakar kii kavita is samay bhi utani hi praasangik maaloom hoti he, jitani ki us daur main jab vah likhi gai thi
 The times may have changed but the circumstances are still the same
 dinakar kaa janm23 sitambar 1908 ko aaj ke bihar rajya main padane vaale begusarai jile ke simriya gram main hua tha
 His famous compositions are Urvashi, Rashmirathi, Renuka, four chapters of culture, Hunkar, Samadheni, Neem leaves
 unki mrityu 24 april 1974 ko hui thi
 Here are 5 of his poems
 1
 Kalam, today his Jai Boljala ashes turn by turn, in which the sparks, which have climbed up to the feet of the neck without virtue, today their Jai Bol
 jo aganit laghu deep hamaretuphanon main ek kinare,jal-jalaakar bujh gaye kisi dinamaanga nahin sneh munh kholkalam, aaj unki jai bol
 Drink those whose red creations flung out hundred light directions, whose euphoria continued to be full of fear, yet Dolakalam, today, their words
 andhaa chakachaundh kaa marakya jane itihaas bechaara,saakhi hai unki mahima kesurya chandra bhugol khagolkalam, aaj unki jai bol

 bharat kaa yah reshmi nagarbharat dhulon se bharaa, aansuon se geela, bharat ab bhi vyakul vipatti ke ghere main
 There is a lot of light in Delhi, but the whole country is wandering in darkness
 reshmi kalam se bhagya-lekh likhanewaalon, tum bhi abhaav se kabhi grast ho roye ho?biimaar kisi bachche kii dawa jutaney main, tum bhi kya ghar bhar pet baandhakar soye ho?asahaay kisaanon kii kismat ko kheton main, kayaa jal me bah jate dekha he?kya khaaenge? yah soch niraashaa se pagal, becharon ko neerav rah jate dekha he?dekha he graamon kii anek rambhaon ko, jin kii abha par dhul abhi tak chhaayi he?reshmi deh par jin abhaaginon kii ab tak resham kya? sari sahi nahin chadh paayi he
 But why will you bring the red, rich mannequins of the cities, the agony in the hearts of the destitute? The whole country burns, but impatient through it, why will you extinguish this fire by running? Why should you worry about burning the village, in Delhi The loaves are not reduced, there is no dust, no tears, no eyes, the mascara is not moist
 jalte hai to ye gaanv desh ke jala karen, aaraam nayi dilli apana kab chhodeygi?yaa rakkhegi maraghat main bhi reshmi mahal, yaa aandhi kii khaakar chapet sab chhodeygi

 parashuram kii pratikshahe vir bandhu ! daayi he koun vipad kaa ?ham doshi kisko kahen tumhaare vadh kaa ?yah gahan prashn; kaise rahasy samajhaayen ?das-bees adhik hon to ham naam ginaayen
 But, there is a pathak standing here at every step, and ambush standing everywhere is fatal
 ghaatak he, jo devtaa-sadrush dikhataa he,lekin, kamare main galat hukum likhata he,jis paapi ko gun nahin; gotra pyaara he,samajho, usne hi hamen yahan maaraa he
 Whoever does not know the truth and tells the truth, or remains silent due to any greed, is damned to that wretched monarchy, this silent truth is no less valid
 choron ke hai jo hitu, thagon ke bal hai,jinke pratap se palate paap sakal hai,jo chal-prapanch, sab ko prashray dete hai,yaa chatukaar jan se seva lete hai;yah paap unheen kaa hamako maar gaya he,bharat apane ghar main hi haar gaya he
 Who is here, who is not the cause of adversity? Who is not responsible for our slaughter? We are addicted to that which is an extreme sin, this country is wrong because of its physical force
 netaa nimagn din-raat shaanti-chintan main,kavi-kalakaar upar ud rahe gagan main
 Yagyagni does not find solace in Hind, the flame of Pourush is extinguished daily
 o badanaseeb andho ! kamjor abhaago ?ab bhi to kholo nayan, neend se jaago
 Aghi, the appellation of muscle power, whose flame is extinguished, he is a sinner
 jab tak prasann yah anal, sugun hanste he;he jahaan khadg, sab punya vahiin basate hai
 Where there is no valor, there is decay of virtue, where valor is not, there is victory of selfishness
 talwaar punya kii sakhi, dharmapalak he,laalach par ankush kathin, lobh-saalak he
 Leaving Asi, becoming a Bheeru, where Dharma sleeps, Patak Prakhandtam appears there
 talavaarein soti jahaan band myanon main,kismaten vahaan sadati he tahkhaanon main
 The earrings and nostrils are mounted on the sacrificial, bricks of gold, but they are not hard
 pucho kuber se, kab suvarna ve denge ?yadi aaj nahin to suyash or kab lenge ?tufaan uthegaa, pralay-wan chhutegaa,he jahaan swarna, bam vahiin, syat, phutegaa
 Whatever you do, but Kanchan will not survive, maybe, it will hit Suvarna itself
 ham par apane paapon kaa boj na daalen,kah do sab se, apana daayitv sanbhaalein
 Say, prudent, hypocritical, fake, lazy, inept, Kahil, striking, take a tongue, go quietly to work, we shed blood here, they shed sweat in the house
 ham den us ko vijay, hamen tum bal do,do shastr or apana sankalp atal do
 If people are standing there, if they are in the house, who is there to win us who is here in summer? Wherever there is something else, stop it! Whatever they do, sasi-surya, tell them to stop! The fire kept on burning in the minds of the people; Tamas would have increased if Prabha had gone to Prabha, if she had not got the talent, not Ripu, this injustice would kill us, she would lose her home in her own home again

 Summer is remaining
 
 
 
 Loosen the rope of the bow, open the tight end of the tarkas, Who said, the battle is gone, speak peacefully? Who said, and don't drown out the heart of the heart, Bharo Bhuvan's limb from Kunkum, Kusum, Saffron? The Who should i apply? Whom should i sing a gentle anthem? India is hungry before suffering
 phulon ke rangeen lahar par o utaranevaale !o reshmi nagar ke vaasi! o chhavi ke matvaale!sakal desh main halaahal he, dilli main haalaa he,dilli main raushnee, shesh bharat main andhiyaala he 
 Outside the curtains of velvet, on the other side of the flowers, as it stands, even today, the world is like a desert

 It is being told that the car also hit a CRPF bus, causing little damage to it, but it is a matter of honor that the soldiers have not suffered any kind of damage
 yah blast shanivaar subah 10
 It is near Banihal at 30 pm
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki centro car main 2 silendar the, saath hi usamen uria or tel kii bottlen bhi thim
 According to the information so far, as soon as the CRPF convoy passed here, the car exploded in the same time and its children flew away
 is car blast kii tasviir kuch waisi hi he, jaisi pulavama atake main dekhne ko mili thi
 However, the car used in the Pulwama attack was so full of explosives that it was completely destroyed
 ab tak is blast main sabase hairaan karne vaali baat ye he ki ye gaadi hive par koun lekar aayaa isaki jaankaree abhi tak nahin mil pai he
 Because there is no news of the driver of the vehicle yet, due to which many kinds of apprehensions are being strengthened
 kaha ye bhi ja rahaa he ki driver maukey se faraar ho gaya
 In Pulwama attack, a car suddenly hit and hit a CRPF convoy, in which 40 soldiers were killed, although the terrorist Adil, who was sitting in that car, also killed himself
 pulavama hamale main siarpief kii bason ko puri planning ke saath target kiya tha or aatanki apane napak mansoobon ko puraa karne main kaamyaab bhi ho gaye the
 While the CRPF jawans have not suffered any damage in Banihal, but the car in which the blast took place has definitely hit the bus of CRPF
 yani pulavama ke baad hue is car blast kii chapet main bhi siarpief javaanon kii bas hi ai hai
 However, the blast has not been considered a terrorist incident yet, but it has not been ruled out either
 vahiin, khufia input bhi kisi anhoni kii sajeesh ko bal de rahe hai
 It is being told that the intelligence agencies had warned that even after Pulwama, terrorists can execute any attack on jammu-srinagar highway
 aise main yah car blast kya pulavama jaisi hi kisi sajeesh kaa hissaa he, yaa ye koi haadasa bhar he, isaki jaanch hona abhi baaki he
 But CRPF has said that the blast is being investigated from all aspects

 Before coming to India, the Brahmaputra has traveled about thirteen hundred kilometers in China's Tibet, and it is a matter of concern for India that the flow of the Xiaobuku river flowing from it to the Shigatse area of the same Tibet

 True, their attitude towards male sexuality and sexuality of women tells us a lot about all social norms
 ab dekhie na, india today ke 2005 ke survey main 66 fisadi yuva avivaahit mardon ne kaha tha ki ve aisi ladki se shaadi nahin karenge jo shaadi se pehle yon sambandh bana chuki ho
 This percentage increased to 74 percent in the 2006 survey
 kya bistar par mard yaa aurat donon ke anand kaa mahatv he? is sawaal ke jawaab main bhi ek hi aayu samooh ke avivaahit mardon kii raay main baari badlaav aayaa
 In 2005, 83 percent people said "yes," in response to this, but in 2006 the number came down to 67 percent
 isse pataa chalata he ki logon kii yon sambandhon ke bare main kisi ko raji karne main ‘‘langik samanta’’ ab bhi phikr kaa vishay bani hui he
 It also came to light that in the last decade, young Azad Khayal have been inspired to accept girls, but they also live in deep confusion about their independence
 aise main hairat kii baat nahin ki 2012 ke survey main jab yuvaaon se poocha gaya ki ve sambhavit dating partner main kis tarah ke gun dekhnaa chaahate hai to unhone ‘‘sneh’ ko ‘swatantraaa’ se kaaphi upar rakhaa
 Incidentally, India Today also conducted a public debate on homosexuality, the most open secret of Indian life, in a survey conducted by India Today
 aupniveshik jamaane ke kanoon ne bhartiya sexuality ke liye ‘‘prakritik’’ or ‘‘aprakritik’’ jaise kaalpanik shabd gande main madad kii he
 But this fantasy does not hold up in response to men
 haalanki, samalangikta kaa anubhav hasil karne kii baat swikaarne vaale vivaahit purushon ke pratishat main 2004 se 2007 ke bich giravat ai he, lekin un logon kii sankhya dogune se zyada ho gai jinhone kaha ki is bare main unhone pati / patni se charchaa kii he
 The disturbing attitude of people about homosexuality is also evident from the 2012 survey
 badi sankhya main jahaan mard yah kehete hai ki vivahetar sambandhon ke liye ve apni patni ko maaf kar denge, vahiin aise sambandh samalangik prakruti ke rahane par jabardast rup se nakaaratmak jawaab miltaa he
 Statistics from previous years reveal that more and more men are now having their first sexual relationship at an early age
 2005 ke survey main shaamil 32 fisadi avivaahit purushon ne kaha tha ki unhone pehle yon sambandh kaa anubhav 15 se 18 varsh kii umr main kiya
 This percentage reached 52 in 2006
 isse pataa chalata he ki yuvaaon kii sanskri ti main badlaav aa rahaa he or unhen yon sambandh banane ke zyada maukey mil rahe hai
 But the results provide another hint: Most men will think twice before agreeing to marry an "experienced" woman
 yani yuvatiyon ko aage bhi ‘‘shuddhta’’ (yani comarya) kaa boj dhonaa padegaa
 In the last decade, while men have continued to have some sexual taboos, some have also become weaker
 parivaar ke sadasyon ke saath yon sambandh banane ke sawaal par jawaab pehle jaise hi mil rahe hai
 By an overwhelming majority
 duusari ore group sex main shaamil hone kii baat karne vaale yuvaaon kaa pratishat pichley varshon main badha he
 One aspect remains constant even in the changing landscape of the sex world: the emphasis on the value of maintaining a lasting relationship
 vivahetar sambandh aam hai lekin pichley varshon main india today ke sex survey main ise swikaarne vaale mardon kii sankhya ise pratibimbit nahin karti
 In fact, in the 2012 survey, 'husband or wife' has been placed at the top in the group of "ideal sex partners"
 shaayad mardon ko yah abhas he ki yon jagat kii saudebaaji ek pareshaan karne vaali gatividhi he or short turm main jo baat khush karti he, vah shaayad bhavishya main sukh na de
 What is generally true about life is not different from what is true in the context of a culture of sexuality
 danta chikitsak dampati rajesh or nupur talwaar ko shuukravaar ko ek or jhatka laga jab elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ne unki yachika khaarij kii kar di
 In the case of murder of his daughter Aarushi Talwar and servant Hemraj, he filed a petition against the commencement of the process and summons against him
 adaalat main pesh hone main vifal rahane ke kaaran jamaanti warrant jari karne or adalati prakriya shuru karne ke gajiabad main sibiai adaalat ke nau farvari ko aae aadesh ke khilaaf daayar kii gai yachikaaon par ucch nyaayalay kii do peethon ne alag alag aadesh sunaae
 Justice Balakrishna Narayan, while awarding the judgment on Nupur Talwar's plea, said, "if there is prima facie evidence against a person, there is no provision to stop the summons issued by the magistrate against him
" unhone sibiai adaalat ke aadesh ko is aadhaar par chunauti di ki agency ne apni puri jaanch ke dauraan kabhi bhi poochtacha ke liye nahin bulaayaa or naa hi aaropee ke taur par unka naam liya
 Therefore, summons should not have been issued against him
 ucch nyaayalay ne haalanki nupur talwaar ko do hafton ke bheetar nichali adaalat main hajir hone kaa nirdesh diya
 The court said, she can submit her bail application there and it can be considered on the same day
 28 farvari ko gajiabad adaalat se jari kiye gaye jamaanti warrant ke khilaaf rajesh talwaar dwaara ek anya yachika ko nyaayamurti ravindra singh ne khaarij kar diya

 14 saal kii arushi ko noida sthit uske awaas main 16 may 2008 ko mrit paaya gaya tha or agle din usee makaan se hemraj kaa shav bhi baraamad kiya gaya tha
 Rajesh Talwar challenged the CBI court's order stating that he was out on regular bail and hence the lower court should not issue bailable warrants without canceling this bail
 talwaar kii daleel kaa sibiai or uttar pradesh sarkaar ne virodh kiya or unke vakeelon ne kaha ki jamaanti warrant kaa uddeshy keval aaropee ko sunwaayee adaalat ke saamne pesh karne ko sunishchit karne ke liye hota he
 Talwar's lawyer Samit Gopal said that the Talwar couple can approach the Supreme Court against the orders
 sibiai ke vakil ne faisle ko aitihaasik bataaya
 He said, summons has been issued to the couple and the summons order of the CBI court has been upheld by the High Court
 ucch nyaayalay ne maamle par faisla sunaaya or kaha ki sibiai adaalat ke faisle main kisi tarah kii kanoonee gadabadi nahin thi
 Initially, the Uttar Pradesh police indicated that the girl and servant were killed by Aarushi's father after being seen in an objectionable state
 police ke is daawey se upje ho halle ke baad mayawati sarkaar ne maamle ko sibiai ko saunp diya tha
 During the investigation, CBI extensively interrogated Rajesh Talwar and also conducted narco test and brain mapping
 antat: jaanch agency ne is saal kii shuruuaat main closer report saunp di lekin maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi vishesh adaalat ne kaha ki mritak ladki ke mata pita ke khilaaf prakriya shuru karne ke liye paryaapt saboot hai
 The body of Majid, a close henchman of Dawood Ibrahim, has been recovered from a hotel in Nepal

 From here, the open play of black money is being done through hawala and this amount is worth billions of rupees
 itnaa hi nahin yah sari jaankaree sarkaar ke paas bhi he
 In fact, in the Enforcement Directorate (ED) investigation, it has come to light that hawala traders from Delhi and Punjab are money laundering for the world's biggest drugs sidelines

 According to the facts revealed by the ED investigation, several million dollars were deposited in two Hong Kong banks
 honkong ke queens road par sthit HSBC Bank or vahiin se thodi dur par sthit he heng seng bank
 According to sources, approximately 10 million Australian dollars, or Rs 53 crore, were provided to the drug mafia from these two banks
 darasal, drugs kii ab tak kii sabase badi jaanch main idi, landan kii scotland yard, australia kii fedral police, america kii drugs inforcement police or honkong kii khufia agency kii madad le rahi he
 As soon as the money shop became a money exchange center, the Modi government indicated that black money would be tightened
 sanket dilli main hi die gaye the or idi kii jaanch bataati he ki nashe ke kaarobaar se kalaadhan banane kaa khel dilli se hi chalata he or nakel abhi tak kasi nahin ja chuki he
 The game is now coming to light through ed's investigation of how black money is made out of the black business of drugs and how black money is increased through hawala black money
 masalan dilli se yah khel aakhir chalata kaise he

 sushmita sen or wasim akram ne un khabaron kaa khandan kiya he, jinamein kaha ja rahaa he ki ve shaadi kii yojana bana rahe hai
 He asked the media to respect his privacy
 isse pehle kuch reporton main kathith rup se kaha gaya tha ki donon shaadi kii yojana bana rahe hai
 But Sushmita said on micro-blogging website Twitter on Thursday, 'hello guys
 main wasim ke saath apni shaadi kii khabar pard rahi hum
 This is completely nonsense
 isse lagata he ki media kai baar kitna gaiyr jimmedaarana ho saktaa he
