 Significantly, the BJP has governments in the Center and Maharashtra
 maharashtra ke marketing vibhaag ke mantri subhash deshmukh buudhvaar ko dilli main the
 He met Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan over Maharashtra's proposal
 maharashtra sarkaar ne gat maheene ke aakhri hafte main centre ko prastaav bheja tha ki sarkari mandi main pyaaj bech chuke kisaan ko prati quintal 100 rupee anudaan diya jaae
 Half of this grant was to be spent by the Center and half to the state government
 kul 65 karod rupee kaa kharch anumaanit tha
 Out of this, 32 crore 50 lakh rupees were to be spent from the vault of the center
 tippaniyan Coming out of Wednesday's meeting, Maharashtra Marketing Minister Subhash Deshmukh told media persons that the Center has turned down the proposal of the state government as the Center does not have any such grant scheme
 deshmukh ke bayaan main hataasha saaf jhalak rahi thi
 This time 15 lakh tonnes of onions have been produced in Maharashtra
 is utpaadan ko haal hi main baadh or vyapaaree banaam kisaan jaise sankat jhelane pade
 Due to which onion prices hit the ground
 aise main kisaanon ko raahat dene ke liye kendriya sadak parivahan mantri nitin gadakari kii pahal par sabsidi dene kaa prastaav saamne aayaa tha
 But after rejecting this proposal from Ram Vilas Paswan, now there is a crisis facing the farmers' anger in front of the BJP government of the state
 isse bachane ke liye maharashtra sarkaar ne pyaaj ke niryaatkon ko di ja rahi prati quintal 5% emport sabsidi ko badhaane or kisaan kii prati quintal sabsidi ko manjuuri dene kii guzarish kii he

 Now the state government will have to send its proposal again to the center
 buudhvaar kii baithak se baahar nikalate hue maharashtra ke vipanan mantri subhash deshmukh ne media karmiyon ko bataaya ki centre ne rajya sarkaar kaa prastaav thukraa diya he kyonki is tarah se anudaan dene kii koi skim centre ke paas he hi nahin
 The desperation was evident in Deshmukh's statement
 maharashtra main is baar 15 lakh ton pyaaj kaa utpaadan hua he
 This production has suffered from recent floods and crises such as merchant versus farmer
 jisase pyaaj ke daam jameen par utar gaye
 In such a situation, a proposal to give subsidy came on the initiative of Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari to provide relief to the farmers
 lekin is prastaav ko ramvilas paswan kii taraf se nakaare jane par ab rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ke saamne kisaanon kaa gussa jhelane kaa sankat aa khadaa he
 To avoid this, the Maharashtra government has requested to increase the import subsidy to 5% per quintal given to onion exporters and approve subsidy per quintal of the farmer
 ab rajya sarkaar ko dubaara apana prastaav centre ko bhejnaa hoga
 This time 15 lakh tonnes of onions have been produced in Maharashtra
 is utpaadan ko haal hi main baadh or vyapaaree banaam kisaan jaise sankat jhelane pade

 The land will be found while the report praises the model of Gujarat, describing its land acquisition model as exemplary

 maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav (maharashtra Assembly Election) se pehle bijepi or shivasena ke bich rajya main sitabantwaare ko lekar sthiti saaf hoti nahin dikh rahi he
 In such a situation, it remains a big question whether this time both the parties will contest the elections as a coalition or whether both the parties will field their separate candidates in all the seats
 bijepi -shivasena gathbandhan se jude ek sutara ne NDTV se kaha ki rajya main chunaav se pehle bijepi ek bade bhai kii bhoomika nibhaana chaahati he
 And if this happens, Shiv Sena will not be given more than 120 seats out of 288 seats in the upcoming assembly elections
 vahiin, khabar yah bhi aa rahi he ki shivasena is gathbandhan ko todane par vichaar to nahin kar rahi he lekin vah is chunaav main akele utar sakati he
 Although nothing has been officially said
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ke kareebi ek sutara ne bataaya ki abhi tak parde peeche gathbandhan ko lekar jo bhi baat ho rahi he usase itnaa to saaf he ki rajya ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis is baar chunaav main siton ke 50-50 fisadi ke bantwaare vaale formule par sahamat nahin honge
 This is the reason why a few days ago, Fadnavis said in gestures that nothing has been decided yet on the seat sharing
 unhone kaha tha ki agar bijepi-shivasena ko ek gathbandhan ke taur par ladanaa he to hamen hameshaa yah dhyaan main rakhana hoga ki hamen kuch milegaa or hamen kuch nahin milegaa
 Significantly, before the seat sharing, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray praised the central government for Article 370
 saath hi unhone ram mandir banane kii maang bhi kii thi
 He said that it makes no sense to wait for the Ram temple now
 thakare ne kaha tha ki hamanen shivasena kaaryakartaaon se kaha he ki vah taiyaar rahe hai
 The time has come when the foundation stone of the Ram temple will be laid in Ayodhya
 yah vah mudda he jise hamaare sansthaapak balasaheb thakare ne dekha tha
 Uddhav Thackeray further said that the way the government is working, it has raised our expectations that the government will soon construct the Ram temple in Ayodhya
 ab intjaar karne kaa koi matabal nahin banataa he
 Let us tell you that during the Lok Sabha elections, Uddhav Thackeray had attacked BJP many times for the construction of Ram temple
 unhone kaha tha ki jis tarah se modi sarkaar ne beete paanch saalon main kaam kiya he, usase aisa kahin se bhi nahin lagata he ki vah ram mandir banavaane ko lekar kisi tarah se gambhir he
 Significantly, amid reports of the ruling BJP and Shiv Sena tightening their stand on the seat-sharing to contest the impending assembly elections in Maharashtra, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had said that in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the alliance of the two parties '' Atal '' And this alliance will return to power once again

 Thackeray had said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has provided leadership and direction to the country which has immense potential for progress and development
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 ke adhiktar praavdhaanon ko samaapt karne or chandrayan -2 abhiyaan ke liye main modi ko badhai detaa hum 
 
 
 Now the nation is waiting for the construction of a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya and a uniform civil code
 ''unhone kaha tha ki kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang he or rahegaa
 PM Modi has proved it not only in words but in reality
 thakare ne kaha tha ki mahatvakankshi chandramaa mishan kii liye desh ko isro ke vaigyanikon par bhi garv he
 India has immense potential, and in Modi, the country has got the (right) direction to lead
 thakare ne yah bhi kaha thaki bhartiya janata party ke saath gathbandhan jari rahegaa

 The court said that the provisions of the Kerala Hindu Public Place of Worship (right to Access) Rules, 1965, which stamped this ban, are violations of the rights of devout Hindu women

 M
 khanvilakar ke vichaaron se hi ittefaq rakhte the, jabaki peeth kii ekmaatr mahila nyaayadhish indu malhotra ne asahmati kaa faisla sunaaya
 Earlier, the Kerala High Court had justified the provision of ban on entry of women in the temple on the grounds that only the presiding head priest had the right to decide the traditions
 indian yang loyrs association or baaki logon ne hycourt ke is faisle ko supreme court main chunauti di thi or yah daleel di thi ki yah parampara mahilaon kii maahvaaree main ashuddhta kii avadharana par aadhaarit he or lihaaja bhedbhaavpurn he
 Justice Chandrachud said that such a ban on women is a violation of their human dignity
 yah court kii jimmedaari he ki vah samvidhan kii prastaavna main nihit sanvaidhanik naitikta ko kaayam rakhe jo samanta, swatantraaa or maanviya garima ke siddhanton par aadhaarit he
 Thus, the court ruled that the prohibition of women entering the Sabarimala temple is discriminatory
 nyaayadhishon ne kaha ki mahilaon ke pravesh par roak gaiyr-dharmik kaarnon kii vajah se he or yah hindu dharmik paramparaon ke mul tatwon kaa hissaa nahin he
 Justice Chandrachud, while referring to the fine balance between Articles 14 and 15 (against equality and discrimination) and Articles 25 and 26 (the right of any religious group or religion to decide its own particular practice and method of worship), said that the judge was not a religious teacher
 Therefore, they should judge any ritual or tradition only on the basis of constitutional ethics
 yah faisla saaf taur par vyaktigat swatantraaa ko samoohgat adhikaron ke upar rakhata he or sanvaidhanik nyaay ke paimaanon ko bhi spasht rup se vyakt karata he
 It is the responsibility of the state to uphold freedom, equality and dignity
 faisla yah bhi saaf kar detaa he ki jo prathaen in mulyon se ittefaq nahin rakhti, rajya ko unka paksh nahin lenaa chahie
 The verdict also reduces the imperative of court complicity in the question of the basic elements of religion and its practices
 pradhan nyaayadhish ne (jis par justise khanvilakar kii unase sahmati thi) kaha ki dharmaparayanata ke maamle main koi bhedbhaav nahin kiya ja saktaa or pitrusattatmak manyataon ko badla janaa chahie
 Justice Nariman said that such discriminatory practices are prevalent in all ancient religions
 ye paramparaayen mahilaon ko garima se vanchit karti hai or unhen kamatar banaati hai
 Justice Malhotra believed that it was not the court's job to decide which religious practices should be abolished except in cases of social evil like "sati"
 unhone kaha, "gahari dharmik bhaawanaaon vaale muddon main saamaanya taur par court ko dakhal nahin dena chahie
 The Sabarimala temple and Lord Ayyappa are protected under Article 25 of the Constitution and religious beliefs cannot be tested on Article 14 alone
 ''unhone aage kaha, "koun-si dharmik manyata anivaary he, yah tay karnaa dharmik samudaay kaa kaam he, court kaa nahin
 India is a country of diverse cultures
 sanvaidhanik naitikta sabhi ko unke vishwaas ke anusaar aacharan karne kii ijaajat deni hogi
 The court should not interfere in it unless a victim of that community or religion comes forward
 ''asahmati kaa yah faisla court ke dakhal ke jariye saamaajik badlaav ke sawaal ko saamne laa khadaa karata he
 Discriminatory traditions towards women are found everywhere
 haal hi main, mumbai main musalmaan mahilaon ne is aadhaar par aitihaasik haji ali dargah ke mukchay kaksh main pravesh kaa adhikaar hasil kar liya ki yah pabandi haal hi main manamaane tareeke se lagaai gai thi kyonki kai dargahen mahilaon ko bhitari kaksh tak jane kii ijaajat detii hai
 The managers of the dargah argued that if men and women were allowed to come together, it would divert the attention of men and it was also against the beliefs of Islam
 ahmednagar main shani shinganapur mandir main court ke adeshon ke baavjood mahilaon ko pravesh nahin karne diya ja rahaa tha kyonki mandir samiti ke logon kaa kahana tha ki isse shani dev naaraaz ho jaaenge or balaatkaar kii ghatnaayen bad jaaengi
 Many other temples in the country ban the entry of women
 muslim mahilaon ko kai masjidon main namaaj padhgaye kii ijaajat nahin hoti or roman catholic mahilaayein padri kii bhoomika nahin nibhaa saktin
 The common thing in all these restrictions is patriarchy which is based on the concept of impurity of women and then it becomes a justification to deprive women of their rights
 isamen ek or sajhi baat yah avadharana bhi he ki mahilaayein bahakaane vaali hoti hai or unamem purushon ko vash main kar lene kii takat hoti he
 This is the recurring motif of the Hawa, which caused mankind to sin and caused mankind to fall and then be expelled from heaven forever
 yahi avadharana tamaam sabhyataaon or dharmon main sthapana bindu ke taur par chalati rahati he
 The concept seems to have been established in the later period of civilization when patriarchy was taking root and political power was confined to kings, feudal lords and family dynasties
 krishi bhoomi kaa nijee swaamitv jagah bana rahaa tha or vah bhojan ko ekatra karne kii us puraani sanjayata kii jagah le rahaa tha jisamen samuhik jivan or bhoomi kaa saajha swaamitv hi sabase khaas baaten thim
 It is probably during this transition period that women lost their status of superiority, which had been maintained since the beginning of civilization
 yah mana jaataa tha ki mahilaon ke paas prajnan kii vishesh shakti he or unka maahvaaree chakra is shakti kaa moort rup he jo chandramaa ke ghatane-badhane ke chakra ke anuroop he
 Therefore, seeds sown in the ground were also mixed with life-threatening menstrual bleeding
 hamaare myth or lok kathaayen majboot or taqatvar mahilaon ke chithran se bhari padi hai
 Woman was the embodiment of strength — power — that could destroy the wicked
 nariwadi maanavvigyaani or itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki pitrusatta ne purushon kii shreshthata kaayam karne ke iraade se hi mahilaon kii ashuddhta kii dharna saamne rakhni shuru kin
 Gradually, when patriarchy started its roots, women were tortured for their power of healing and prophecy, and in the medieval period many healers and midwives etc
 were burned as witches
 hamen yah moolyankan bhi karnaa chahie ki is faisle kaa prabhaav jamini str par jaden jamaaye baithe bhedbhaavon par kya padegaa, jo sadiyon se kaayam hai or jinhen khud mahilaon ne apane bheetar aatmsaat kar liya he
 Ironically, logicians seeking this solution are not the ideal "devotees" of Lord Ayyappa himself
 darasal maahvaaree ko lekar varjanaayen shahari bharat main shikshit ucch vargeey pariwaron main bhi usee tarah se kaayam hai
 However, it can be debated whether a change in religious traditions and customs can be brought about through a judicial decision
 is maamle main ready tu wet abhiyaan kii pravaktaa padma pillai ke hawaale se da news minute ne kaha tha ki is faisle kaa jamini str par koi asar nahin padegaa
 He said, "the simple thing is that this decision will not change for me personally and for devotees like me
 ham log tab tak sabarimala nahin jaaenge jab tak hamen bhagwaan ayyappa kii ijaajat nahin mil jaati
 "the judgment of the Supreme Court lies on the notion of reasonableness and the judge who pronounced the judgment of disagreement said that there is no place of reasonableness in the matter of faith
" justise chandrachud kaa faisla jitna bhi parishkrut ho, vah hindu dharm ke taane-bane ke dhaagon ko vilgane kii koshish karata he
 Pratap Bhanu Mehta has posed a legitimate question, "what is the direct limit to the loss of a person's status beyond which the state should interfere? After all, the state should not correct every mistake
" carch main mahila padri nahin ho sakati, yah bhedbhaavpurn he
 But should the state ask him to do so? Chandrachud's judgment suggests that the state should intervene every time it comes to know of a cultural tradition that even mildly embodies the ideology of inequality
 '' ve yah bhi kehete hai ki justise malhotra is baat ko lekar hoshiyaar karne main sahi thim ki yah saamaajik sudhaaron ke naam par puri tarah se rajya ke mat ko lagu karne sareekha ho jayega
 This brings to my mind the incident when the Chairperson of the National Commission for Women recently demanded that confession (confession, which was considered a basic compulsory religious element among Roman Catholics, after allegations of rape on clergy in Kerala came to light) If it is to be banned, then the alarm bells started ringing in the ears of the entire Christian community

 gujarat ke congress prabharee gurudas kaamat ko buudhvaar ko pad se hataa diya gaya
 Former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has been given the charge
 gujarat main is saal vidhansabha chunaav hone hai, lekin gurudas kaamat party main gutbaji par lagaam lagane main asafal rahe
 For this reason, he was removed from the post
 pichley kuch dinon se gujarat main mukhyamantri pad kii ummidavaari ko lekar congress main ghamaasan machaa hua he
 a few days ago Gurudas Kamat came to Gujarat when he went to visit the Ambaji temple
 us samay shankarasingh waghela ke samarthak kai vidhayakon ne unase mulaakaat kii thi or waghela ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karne kii maang kii thi
 The comments waghela haalanki is mudde par chup hi rahe or saarvajanik rup se yahi kaha ki kuch emele unase milane aae the, party ke senior log bhi the or unase is bare main sarthak baatcheet hui bijepi kii chunauti kaa kis tarah se saamana kiya jaae
 According to him, there was neither factionalism nor any negative thing in it
 mahatvapurn ye bhi he ki us vakt rajya congress pramukh bharatsingh solanki videsh gaye hue the
 As soon as he came, he too got information about this factionalism and Rahul Gandhi was also requested
 aarope ye bhi lage the ki kaamat alag se logon se milakar gutbaji ko uksaa rahe hai
 Bharatsinh did not say anything on the post of Chief Minister, but said that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi will decide the leadership
 ye charchaa aam ho rahi he ki congress ek taraf gujarat main bhaajapa kaa kadaa muqabla karne kaa daawa kar rahi he, lekin chunaavon se pehle hi gutbazi se vah kaaphi pareshaan he
 For the last few days, there has been an uproar in the Congress over the candidature for the post of Chief Minister in Gujarat
 kuch din pehle gurudas kaamat gujarat aae the, tab vah ambaji mandir ke darshan ke liye gaye the
 At that time, several mlas who supported Shankarsinh Vaghela met him and demanded that Vaghela be declared the chief ministerial candidate
 tippaniyan Vaghela, however, remained silent on the issue and publicly stated that some mlas had come to meet him, were also senior people of the party and had a meaningful conversation about how to face the bjp's challenge
 unke mutabik isamen na to gutbazi jaisi koi thi or na hi koi nakaaratmak baat thi
 It is also important that State Congress chief Bharatsinh Solanki went abroad at that time
 aate hi unhen bhi is gutbazi kii jaankaree mili thi or rahul gandhi ko fariyaad bhi kii gai thi
 Allegations were also made that Kamat was provoking factionalism by meeting people separately
 bharatsingh ne mukhyamantri pad par to kuch nahin kaha tha, lekin kaha ki netritv kaa faisla sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi karenge
 It is becoming common discussion that the Congress is claiming a tough fight against the BJP in Gujarat on one hand, but it is very upset with the factionalism before the elections

 This claim has been made by Christian Mitchell

 In an exclusive interview to NDTV, Mitchell advised that the Italian government "could do something that India does not like" if the murder accused Marine is not returned
 usne kaha ki yah "apriy" kadam narendra modi or itavali pradhanmantri matero renzi kii "mulaakaat kii sweekaarokti" bhi ho saktaa he
 Both governments have denied that the Prime Ministers of the two countries had any such meeting during the UN Conference in New York in which it was necessary to give such information related to the Augusta chopper deal in return for the Italian marines accused of murder in India
 There was an alleged proposal that could explain the role of Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 haalanki mishael ne jor diya ki kathith mulaakaat hui thi jabaki sarkaron ne sirf aupchaarik taur par mulaakaat ko nakaara he
 Mitchell admitted that there was no such meeting during the UN Conference in New York

 The comments mishael ne NDTV se kaha ki "ve (italy) congress ke marine maamle main asahyog se khush nahin hai
 The Italian government is new and has a chance to resolve the marines case

 For the advice given to resolve the matter in the meeting, it would have been presumed that Mrs Gandhi was involved in this, whereas it was not
 main jaanata hum ki ye thodaa jatil hoga
 On the possibility of India sending the Italian naval back, Mitchell said that the talks cannot be successful when the basis of negotiation is wrong, the PM is in a very bad position
 So the Italian government will make the meeting public by getting angry with them
 agasta westland deal maamle main kathith rup se bichauliye kii rishwat dene main bhoomika kaa maamla milan court ke faisle ke baad phir se surkhiyon main aa gaya tha
 Only last month, a Milan court concluded on the basis of letters and notes from some of Augusta's advisors and officials that a bribe had been given in the case
 mishael ne mana ki unamem se ek dastavej uskaa he jisamen bade netaaon ke liye helicopter lene ke liye sonia gandhi ko nirnay lene main " sanchaalak shakti " bataaya tha
 "he emphasized that no bribe was given to Mrs Gandhi and that it was natural to see her power to top the list of mobilization
 mishael ne NDTV se kaha ki "ve (italy) congress ke marine maamle main asahyog se khush nahin hai
 The Italian government is new and has a chance to resolve the marines case
 mulaakaat main maamla sulajhane ke liye jo salaah di gai uske liye ye maananaa padataa ki shrimati gandhi isamen shaamil thim jabaki aisa nahin tha
 i know it will be a bit complicated
 bharat dwaara itavali nausainik waapas bheje jane kii sambhaavna par mishael ne kaha ki jab baatcheet kaa aadhaar hi galat ho to baatcheet safal nahin ho sakati piem bahut buree sthiti main hai yadi ve nausainikon ko waapas bhejte hai to un par mulaakaat karne ke aarope lag jaaenge nahin to italy sarkaar unase naaraaz hokar mulaakaat saarvajanik kar degi
 In the agustawestland deal case, the role of alleged bribe bribe was again in the news following the Milan court's decision
 pichley maheene hi milan ke ek court ne agasta ke kuch salaahkaaron or adhikariyon ke patron or nots ke aadhaar par nishkarsh diya tha ki maamle main rishwat di gai thi 
 Mitchell admitted that one of those documents belonged to him in which Sonia Gandhi was described as the "driving force" in deciding whether to pick up helicopters for top leaders
 " usne jor diya ki shrimati gandhi ko koi rishwat nahin di gai or unki shakti ko dekh kar lamabandi kii suchi main unhen sabase upar rakhana swaabhaavik tha

 On Sunday, the sight of Gandhi Nagar, Asia's largest textile wholesale market, was changed
 aamtaur par gandhi nagar kii galiyon main paidal chalanaa behad mushkil hota hai
 But after the GST was implemented, the market was deserted on Sunday
 jin sadakon par paidal chalanaa mushkil hota hai
 The car was moving smoothly there
 wo bhi bina roak-tok ke
 On Friday, the entire country turned into a single common market with GST
 sarkaar ne ise duusari aazaadee qaraar diya he
 But with this freedom, textile traders across the country are facing the most difficulties
 kapade par laga jiestikapade par kisi tarah kaa koi tex nahin hua karata tha
 But with the implementation of GST, cloth also came under the tax net
 vyapaariyon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ko jiesti lagu karne se pehle vyapaariyon or sie ko acchhee tahas se training deni chahie thi
 So that there is no deadlock in doing business
 lekin jiesti ke lagu se se rosemara ke kaamon par khaasaa asar dikhaai de rahaa he
 What is the problem of textile traders? Due to the imposition of GST, textile traders are facing a lot of trouble
 kapadaa vyapaaree amit agarwal kaa kahana he ki maal ko apane godaam par pahunchaana ho to kaise pahunchaayenge or godaam se maal ko dukaan par laana ho to kaise laaenge
 The warehouse of a trader is on the second of 5 to 10 kilometer
 to us maal ko kis bill ke tahat idhar udhar lekar jayega
 If the businessman has to take something home to face, then he will take out the goods on the basis of which paper
 pehle kapade par kisi tarah kaa koi tex nahin tha isliye laane- lejaane main kisi tarah kii koi dikkat nahin hoti thi
 It is not known to traders as well as cas
 aise main kaaphi dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Jobwork is facing problems due to the implementation of GST, textile traders are facing the most problem in jobwork
 ek vyapaaree ne dhaagaa kharida us dhaage se kapadaa banaaya
 Then given for dyeing
 aise main jiesti ke kis formet ke tahat is prakriya ko jiesti ke daayre main laayaa jayega
 Even traders do not know this
 kapadaa vyapaaree sanjay agarwal kaa kahana he, isaki jaankaree ko hamaare sie ke paas bhi nahin he
 Then go to whom
 sanjay ne bataaya ki agar ham yah maanakar chalem ki dhaage par 5 pratishat jiesti laga he, neeting par bhi paanch pratishat jiesti laga or daaing par bhi paanch pratishat laga he
 But 18% of GST has been imposed on Dyer's chemical
 aise main bhala kapadaa kis hisaab se bechaa jayega
 Neither the government nor CA have information about this
 jaankaree nahin hone se kapadaa vyapaaree hai pareshankapadaa vyapaariyon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar jiesti lagu karne se pehle puri jaankaree muhaiyyaa kara detii to kisi tarah kii dikkat kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa
 Some traders feel that traders below two lakhs will not have to take GST number
 sarkaar ne abhi tak yah saaf nahin kiya he
 Whether the refund will be given to the traders
 aisi tamaam tarah kii dikkaton se vyapaariyon ko do chaar hona pad rahaa he
 Traders believe that GST should be implemented after a proper system and training of traders well
 jiesti lagu hone par aise kai niyam hai jo abtak sie ko bhi acchhee tarah se nahin maaloom
 When the CA does not know anything, how will the common merchant be able to implement it

 There was not even a furore over the installation of the statue of Mahatma Gandhi's assassin Nathuram Godse in Meerut, UP
 a bridge in Alwar of Kirajasthan was named Godse
 ensiaar kshetra main aane vaale alvar main 750 meter lambey is fliover par ek pattica lagi thi, jis par likhaa tharashtravaadi nathuram godcepul
 This flyover connects Bhagat Singh Circle of Alwar city with Agrasen Circle
 haalanki media ke sawaal karne ke baad is pattica ko hataa diya gaya
 The English newspaper The Times of India has published news to this effect
 gauratlab he ki is pul ke nirmaan ko congress kii ashok gahalot sarkaar ne 2012 main manjuuri di thi
 The construction of the bridge was completed during the tenure of the bjp-led government of Vasundhara Raje at a cost of 22 crores
 mana ja rahaa he ki is pul kaa udghaatan aane vaale kuch dinon main kiya jayega
 Officials kept on avoiding media questions about the naming of the bridge for about two hours
 iske baad apane raajnneetik or beuroperesi ke hukmaranon se salaah mashvire ke baad colector mahavir swami ne pul par lagi pattica ko hataane ke liye adhikariyon kii team bheji
 The Collector of Alwar said that this is the work of some anti-social elements, who want to spread communal tension
 haalanki colector is baat kaa jawaab nahin de paae ki prashasan or workaron kii bina jaankaree ke fliover par pattica kaise lagi
 There is more snow falling in the corridors of power in Delhi than in the snow
 do dinon se dilli main barf kii silli gir rahi he magar koi iske bare main baat nahin karnaa chahta
 There has been a report about which the breath of the readers is set, whoever reads, turns off his phone so that no one asks for a response
 patrkaar is report ko chhodkar baaki sari report dhuandhar tareeke se twit kar rahe hai taaki barf kii is silli par jitani jaldi ho sake, dhul jam jaae
 Very rarely, a reporter named Niranjan Takle has published this report by removing a layer of dust on the corpse of a judge, very easily it wants to suppress that report under the Delhi snowball
 magar yah report dhire-dhire whats ap ke tahkhaanon main bina bataae ek jagah se duusari jagah pahunch rahi he
 After reading this long report published in English, the reader starts feeling himself falling into such a dark well of fear, where even his scream does not reach him
 hamane kai logon se pratikriya ke liye poocha, dobaaraa jab phone kiya to phone band ho gaya
 The fear of power disarms everyone
 kya vaaki ek sibiai ke jaj kii maut se jude sawaalon se kahani main itane chhed ho jate hai ki aapako us chhed ke us paar koi hatyara thahaake laga rahaa hota he, uski hansi pahachaani lagati he magar naam jubaan par nahin aata he
 The impact of this report is like a mysterious thriller which should be taught in a journalism course
 jo bhi paanch lakh fees dekar patrakarita pard rahe hai unhen is par project karnaa chahie
 Sometimes it is also due to legitimate reasons that others wait before putting their hand to the story of the institute
 yah puri tarah se thik bhi he magar hairaani kii baat ye he ki do dinon tak chhapane ke baad bhi adaalaton ke galiyaaron se koi awaz sunai nahin di
 It is possible that no one has read
 jajon ke paas vakt kahaan hota he, agar padhi hoti to unhen kya karnaa chahie tha, kya ek jaj kii maut se jude sawaalon kii file dobaaraa nahin khul sakati he
 Shouldn't the court have given this assurance to the law minister, to the acting guardian of the country, the Prime Minister
 kya vipaksh ko sawaal nahin karnaa chahie tha
 Shouldn't everyone give an assurance that we will investigate this or else the people inside the judiciary will lose their trust, otherwise people outside the judiciary will not have confidence in the people sitting inside
 patni apane pati or betaa apane pita kii maut par khamosh ho gaye
 Their fear may have been reasonable, but Justice Loya's doctor sister dared to say it after three years
 lekin jab ek bahan ne baat kah di, ek reporter ne report chhap di, ek patrika ne use logon tak pahunchaa diya to phir dilli main patrakaron or nyaay jagat ke logon kii jubaan par barf kii silli kyon jam gai he
 Story is scary
 maine is story ko padhane vaale patrakaron ko darate dekha he
 i was shocked to find out whether the death of a judge was really death or that someone was murdered
 nagpur main 1 disambar 2014 kii subah jaj brijagopal loya kii maut dil kaa daura padane se bataai jaati he
 Three years later, her sister's questions pierce her bones, she seems to have been murdered by someone and the killer is comfortably watching TV
 usne kairavaan kii story chupake se padhi to hogi
 It is possible that to cover this story, a storm of hindu-muslim issues may arise in Delhi, there may be issues where there is a war between Maulana and anchors on TV, but whenever the storm stops, the story starts to shine
 patrakarita kaa ek daayitv yah bhi he jab saare log kisi story ko mara hua chhod kar chale jaaen to bahut dinon baad vahaan lautaa jaae or dekha jaae ki vahaan kuch or suraag to nahin tha

 Kannada newspaper Varta Bharati and Madhyam, a newspaper published in Malayalam, have covered this report
 dilli ke akhbaaron ke daftar main os pad gaye hai
 We did not investigate this story of Caravan at our level, but when we saw the video statement of CBI Judge Brijgopal Loya's sister, it seemed that at least the story as it is can be told
 sibiai ke special court ke jaj brijagopal loya soharabuddin encounter maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe the, jis maamle main bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah mukhya aaropee the
 On 30 December 2014, CBI Special CBI Judge MB Gosavi acquits Amit Shah of this charge
 sibiai ne is faisle ke kilaaf upree adaalat main apil nahin kii
 Whether it is intended to appeal or not, who will ask
 jab log ek chhapi hui story se dar jate he vahaan koun poochhega ki apil kyon nahin kii ja rahi he
 On June 6, 2014, Special Judge Uptap resentment reveals why Amit Shah did not come
 jaj utpat aadesh dete hai ki amit shah 20 june ko court main haazir hon, nahin aate hai
 Judge Utpat fixes the date of next hearing on June 26 but he is transferred on June 25

 The niece Nupur, who lives with her, has told that there is a lot of tension about this case
 ise kaise samajha jaae, isamen bahut log shaamil hai
 How to deal with it
 bhanji ne yah baat kairavaan ke reporter niranjan taakale ko bataai
 From then onwards Niranjan started investigating this story
 31 aktubar ko jaj loya ne poocha ki amit shah haazir kyon nahin hai
 Shah's lawyer says he has given himself up to not be present
 loya yaad dilaate hai ki chhot tab tha jab shah rajya ke baahar hon, us din shah mumbai main the
 Justice Loya dies in Nagpur on the morning of 1 December 2014
 15 disambar 2014 ko jaj loya ke saamne amit shah kii peshi honi thi
 On 30 December, new judge MG Gosavi acquits Amit Shah from all charges
 faisle main kaha jaataa he ki raajnneetik kaarnon se amit shah ko fansaaya gaya tha
 The reference to Amit Shah in the judge's death story is just a matter of context, to tell how many high profile cases he was hearing, it does not mean that anyone is being pointed out, we are not doing that at all, but For the same reason, it seems that the questions related to the death of Judge Loya should be taken seriously so that no one becomes suspicious
 aakhir unki bahan ko bataanaa to padegaa ki unke sawaalon kaa kya hua
 Judge Loya did not want to go to Nagpur
 vahaan ek jaj kii beti kii shaadi main janaa tha magar do jaj kehete hai ki chalanaa chahie
 They go to Nagpur at his behest
 shaadi se laut kar mumbai main apni patni se baat karte hai or uske baad unke parivaar ko kuch pataa nahin chalata
 a call comes in the morning that Judge Loya has died
 niranjan taakale ne jaj loya kii doctor bahan ke hawaale se jo sawaal or ghatana likhaa he ab aap use padhakar or sunakar sihar jaaenge
 Someone can die of a heart attack, but a judge will die
 From his post-mortem to someone else, the decision to send the corpse to the village near the father instead of sending it to the wife and son's house, will make the question so easy Are not
 ek jaj kaa maamuli baton ke liye protocol hota he
 According to what his sister has told, the family did not decide whether Loya's corpse would go to Mumbai or his village from Nagpur
 bas parivaar ke sadasyon ko phone aata he ki unki laash latur ke getgaanv bheji ja rahi he
 Loya's father lives in Getgaon, Loya's three sisters live in Dhule, Jalgaon and Aurangabad
 akhir kisase puch kar justise loya kii laash mumbai kii jagah getgaanv bheji jaati he
 Not only this, there was no protection with the corpse, there was no police, no protocol
 ebulence kaa dryver akele us laash ko getgaanv lekar utarataa he
 The two judges with whom the judge was taken do not contact the family for a month and a half
 ve jaj bhi apane sahyogi kii laash ke saath getgaanv nahin aate hai
 This video was given to us by Caravan magazine
 marathi main jaj loya kii bahan anuraadhaa biani bol rahi hai jinase loya kaaphi baat karte the, maamuli baton ke liye dawa poochhate the
 So the sister knew what kind of problem the brother had
 postmortem report main dil kaa daura padane ke jo kaaran bataae gaye hai, usase doctor bahan sahamat nahin hai
 Those reasons have no history in his family
 bahan kii aadat he diary likhane kii
 She kept writing every day's conversation
 us baatcheet se pataa chalaa ki unhen maut kii soochna kathith taur par aresas ke kaaryakarta ishwar baheti se milti he
 The reporter of Caravan magazine has questioned Ishwar Baheti but the answer has not come
 yahi baheti he jo kuch dinon baad anuraadhaa bayani ke ghar justise loya kaa phone lekar aata he
 Anuradha's question begins to run in the mind how the judge's phone was received by a god Baheti
 jaj kii maut hogi, to unke saamaanon kii zabti hogi or kaayade se police hi lekar aegi
 Not only this, another judge of Anuradha's sister Sarita Mandhane gets a call from a judge
 sarita us din latur main thi
 As soon as the news of his brother's death is received, he goes to pick up his nephew, who is admitted in a hospital in Latur
 lekin vahaan vahi ishwar baheti miltaa he jo phone lekar anuraadhaa ke ghar gaya tha
 Sarita did not pay attention, but the question was settled as to who is this God who flows and brings news of his brother's death
 baheti unhen kahata he ki nagpur jane kii zarurat nahin he
 From there, the body has been sent to Gategaon via ambulance
 baheti unhen ghar lekar jaataa he
 The sisters get a lot of attention from the fact that one judge has died, neither the police nor the administration
 aresas kaa ek aadmi itnaa sab kuch kaise jaanata he
 Many judges are involved when Loya is cremated
 vahaan kuch jaj patni or bete ko kisi se baat karne se manaa karte hai
 Both of them could not muster the courage to speak till today, i can understand, you should also understand
 bas itnaa hi kahana he ki aisa bhi kya jeena ki itnaa darana chahie
 In Delhi, Hartosh Bal, Apoorvanand, Shabnam Hashmi, Manisha Sethi and Syeda Hameed held a press conference and explained the whole thing
 yahaan media ke camere or reporter to maujuud nazar aa rahe hai, ummid he aapako 23 november ke akhbaaron main is khabar ke bare main padhane ko milegaa
 It is possible that the media will create such a ruckus by taking a national syllabus of Hindu Muslim that this news will be suppressed as if the news of the death of a judge is buried for three years
 yahi khubi bhi he ki jab sab log is story par bolne se kataraa rahe hai teen chaar log press conference kar rahe hai or ek reporter niranjan taakale bhi aata he to yah story kar detaa he
 Our colleague Umashankar Singh went to cover this press conference
 maut ko lekar sawaal hi to he, zaahir he jaanch hone main kisi ko kya dikkat he, bolne main itnaa dar kyon hai, kya ham dar ko gale lagane lage hai, yah kisi ke liye acha nahin he
 Stop sharing fear, stop doubting anyone, but when someone asks a question, it is the job of the government and the court to give assurance and answer
 bahan anuraadhaa biani kii baton or apni jaanch ke aadhaar par niranjan taakale ne maut kii raat se jude jo detail jutaaye hai, wo daraane vaale hai
 Judge Loya stayed at Nagpur's VIP guesthouse Ravi Bhavan
 jahaan us vakt kai jaj, kai bade adhikari bhi tehre the
 They are taken by auto when there are complaints of chest pain
 kya us guest house main ek bhi gaadi nahin thi, auto rickshaw se kaise le jaaya gaya
 There are auto rickshaw stands two km from Ravi Bhavan
 loya ko ek aise aspataal main le jaaya jaataa he jahaan isiji mashin kaam nahin kar rahi thi
 From there he is taken to another hospital
 jahaan unhen mrit ghoshit kar diya jaataa he
 It is also not known who took Justice Loya to the hospital
 viipi guest house se ek jaj ko auto main bithakar koun le gaya tha
 When the death took place, there was a news in the media, everyone took the news of the death due to a heart attack
 kisi ko shaq bhi nahin hua
 But Anuradha Biyani and Niranjan Takle draw out some questions from their investigations that at first glance look really more concrete than stone
 postmortem ke har panne par ek vyakti ke dastakhat he
 It is written under the sign that it is Loya's cousin
 anuraadhaa biani kahati hai ki unka koi chachera bhai nahin he
 According to the records, the body of Loya is assigned to it
 magar ambulance main laash lekar to sirf driver gaya tha
 Who was the man and where is he signed at the moment
 tippaniyan The report is very long and scary
 agar ek jaj kii maut se jude sawaal adhure rah sakate hai to ham kis vyavastha main ji rahe hai
 Caravan has published another report, following this report
 jisamen bataaya he ki ek jaj ko is cese ko nipataane ke liye sau karod ke rishwat kii kathith rup se peshkash hui thi
 It is not mentioned here because the questions related to the death of the judge are not over yet
 aap samaj gaye honge ki kyon dilli par barf kii silli padi he
 Can there be so much difference between the investigation of a judge's death and the post-mortem report, Sunanda Pushkar's post-mortem report opens on TV every day, it should also be opened but what answer will be given to the family of Justice Loya
 nagpur ke sitavdi police stesan or sarkari medical college ke do sutron ne niranjan taakale ko bataaya ki unhone aadhi raat ko hi shav dekh liya tha, uskaa postmortem bhi usee vakt kar liya gaya tha
 But in the post-mortem report, the time of the notice of death is six and a quarter
 postmortem shuru hota he 10 bajkar 55 minute par or khatm hota he 11 bajkar 55 minute par
 There are obviously two types of opinion about the time of death and the time of postmart
 kya is report ko yun hi andekha kar diya janaa chahie, kiske hit main in sawaalon ko andekha karnaa, ek jaj kii maut hoti he, unka betaa or patni bolne kaa saahas nahin juta pate to kya bharat ke pramukh nyaayadhish ko unhen suraksha kaa bharosa nahin dena chahie, unhen bolne kaa hausala nahin dena chahie
 After all, when a citizen will give up the courage to live, to speak because of fear, then who will give encouragement
 kya satta ko hamane dar kaa chadar bana liya he ki wo daraati rahegi or ham us dar kii chadar ko taan kar sote rahenge, uske neeche dar se kaanpate rahenge, sawaal simpal he, jaj tamaam tarah ke maamalon kii sunwaayee karte hai
 It is very difficult to say what was the matter related to the murder of someone, but it is not necessary to know that questions are being raised about the death of a judge, when and how to get his answers
 agar is story ke sandarbh se kisi ko dar he to kya bina sandarbh ke parvaah kiye sirf jaj kii maut se jude sawaalon kaa jawaab nahi khoja saktaa he
 The answer is also important for a common citizen
 varanaa sabko lagegaa ki jab ek jaj ke saath aisa ho saktaa he to phir kisi ke saath ho saktaa he
 i also want to tell you one thing
 mujhe bhi dar laga tha, lekin isliye ise kiya taaki anuraadhaa biani ko ye na lage ki uske bhai ko kisi ne maar diya or bolne vaala koi nahin tha
 Loya's son does not feel that in this country no one speaks for anyone
 aisa nahin he
 i hope no one says, the Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India will surely say that there is nothing to fear
 jo sawaal hai unki jaanch hogi
 Except this report, journalists are tweeting the rest of the report in a haphazard manner so that the dust settles on this snowball as soon as possible
 bahut mushkil se niranjan taakale naam ke ek reporter ne ek jaj kii laash par jami dhul kii parat hataa kar ye report chhaapi he, bahut aasaani se us report ko yah dilli barf kii silli ke neeche dabaa dena chaahati he
 But this report is slowly reaching from one place to another in the cellars of What's Up
 angrezi main chhapi is lambii report ko padhate hi pathak dar ke aise andhere kuen main khud ko girtaa hua mahasoos karne lagata he, jahaan uski cheekh bhi uske paas nahin pahunch paati he
 We asked many people for feedback, the phone stopped when i called again
 satta kaa dar sabko nihattha kar detaa he
 Are the questions related to the death of a CBI judge really cause such a hole in the story that you have to hear a killer laughing across that hole, his laughter seems to be recognized but the name does not come on the tongue
 is report kaa asar kisi rahasyamayi thriller sa he jise patrakarita ke course main padhaayaa janaa chahie
 Those who are studying journalism by paying five lakh fees should project on it
 kai baar vaazib kaarnon se bhi hota he ki duusare santhaan kii story ko haath lagane se pehle intazaar karte hai
 This is completely fine as well, but surprisingly, even after two days of printing, no sound was heard from the corridors of the courts
 mumkin he kisi ne padhi na ho
 Where should the judges have time, if they had studied, what should they have done, can the file of questions related to the death of a judge not open again
 adaalat ko, kanoon mantri ko, desh ke kaaryakari sangrakshak pradhanmantri ko kya yah aashwaasan apni taraf se nahin dena chahie tha
 Shouldn't the opposition have questioned
 kya sabko yah aashwaasan nahin dena chahie ki ham is kii jaanch karenge varanaa nyaaypalika ke bheetar ke logon kaa apane kaam se bharosa uth jayega, varna nyaaypalika ke baahar ke logon kaa bheetar baithe logon par bharosa nahin rahegaa
 The wife became silent on the death of her husband and son
 unka dar vaazib hi rahaa hoga, magar justise loya kii doctor bahan ne teen saal baad kehane kii himmat juta lee
 But when a sister spoke, a reporter printed the report, a magazine gave it to the people, then why the snowball has frozen in the words of journalists and people of justice in Delhi
 story daraavnee to he
 i have seen journalists reading this story in awe
 main khud sihar gaya ki kya ek jaj kii maut vaaki maut thi yaa kisi ne hatya kar di
 On the morning of 1 December 2014 in Nagpur, Judge Brijgopal Loya is reported to have died of a heart attack
 teen saal baad unki bahan ke sawaal haddiyon main chhed kar dete hai, lagata he ki unki kisi ne hatya kar di or hatyara aaraam se tivi dekh rahaa he
 He must have read the caravan story secretly
 mumkin he is story par pardaa daalane ke liye dilli main hindu muslim muddon kii aandhi chal jaae, aise masale aa jaaen jahaan tivi par moulana or ankaron ke bich jang chhid jaae lekin jab bhi aandhi thamati he wo story jhalkane lagati he
 It is also an obligation of journalism when all the people leave a story dead and then return to it after a long time and see if there was any more clue

 kairavaan kii is story kii jaanch hamane apane str par nahin kii magar jab sibiai ke jaj brijagopal loya kii bahan kaa video bayaan dekha to laga ki kam se kam jaisi story he use us rup main bataaya ja saktaa he
 CBI Special Court Judge Brijgopal Loya was hearing the Sohrabuddin encounter case in which BJP national president Amit Shah was the main accused
 30 disambar 2014 ko sibiai ke special sibiai jaj embi gosaavi amit shah ko is aarope se bari kar dete hai
 The CBI did not appeal against this decision in the Upper Court
 apil karne kaa iraadaa he bhi yaa nahin, koun poochhega
 When people get scared of a printed story, who will ask why the appeal is not being made
 6 june 2014 ko special jaj utpat naaraazgi zaahir karte hai ki amit shah kyon nahin aae
 The judge orders that Amit Shah should appear in court on June 20, not come
 jaj utpat agali sunwaayee kii tarikh 26 june tay karte hai magar 25 june ko unka tabadalaa ho jaataa he
 The Supreme Court has ordered that the same officer in the Sohrabuddin case will remain in the investigation and hearing from beginning to end
 jaj utpat kaa tabadalaa pune ho jaataa he
 In his place comes 48 years Judge Brijgopal Harikshan Loya
 jaj loya amit shah ko nijee taur par haazir hone kii shart se chhot de dete hai
 It is said that they wanted to revisit the charge sheet of ten thousand pages, new judges were so and case sensitive as well
 unke saath rahane vaali bhanji nupur ne bataaya he ki is cese ko lekar bahut tanaav he
 There are many people involved in how to understand it
 isse kaise nipta jaae
 Bhanji told this to Niranjan Takle, a reporter for Caravan
 usee ke baad se niranjan ne is kahani kii padtaal shuru kar di
 On October 31, Judge Loya asked why Amit Shah is not present
 shah ke vakil kehete hai ki unhone khud haazir naa hone kii chhot di he
 Loya reminds that the exemption was when Shah was outside the state, on that day Shah was in Mumbai
 1 disambar 2014 kii subah nagpur main justise loya kii maut hoti he
 On December 15, 2014, Amit Shah was to appear before Judge Loya
 30 disambar ko nae jaj emji gosaavi amit shah ko sabhi aaropon se bari kar dete hai
 The verdict states that Amit Shah was implicated for political reasons
 jaj kii maut vaali story main amit shah kaa zikr sirf sandarbh kii baat he, bataane ke liye ve kitne hai profile maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe the, iskaa matlab yah nahin ki kisi par ishaara kiya ja rahaa he, wo ham bilkul nahin kar rahe magar isi ek kaaran se yah bhi lagata he ki jaj loya kii maut se jude sawaalon ko gambhirtha se lenaa chahie taaki kisi ko shaq na ho
 After all, his sister will have to tell what happened to her questions
 jaj loya nagpur nahin janaa chaahate the
 a judge's daughter was to go to the wedding there, but two judges say that she should walk
 unke kehane par ve nagpur jate hai
 After returning from marriage, he talks to his wife in Mumbai and after that his family does not know anything
 subah ek phone aata he ki jaj loya mar gaye hai
 Now you will go to Sihar after reading and listening to the question and incident written by Niranjan Takle referring to the doctor sister of Judge Loya
 kisi kii maut dil kaa daura padane se ho sakati he magar ek jaj kii maut hogi uske postmortem se lekar laash ko patni or bete ke ghar bhejne kii jagah baap ke paas gaanv bhejne kaa faisla koi or kar legaa, yah sab sawaal itani aasaani se hajam nahin hote hai
 a judge has a protocol for trivia
 unki bahan ne jo baat bataai he unke anusaar parivaar kaa faisla nahin tha ki nagpur se loya kii laash mumbai jaaegi yaa unke gaanv
 Just family members get a call that their corpse is being sent to Gategaon in Latur
 getgaanv main loya ke pita rahete hai, loya kii teen bahanen dhule, jalgaanv or aurangabad main rahati hai
 After asking whom, Justice Loya's body is sent to Gategaon instead of Mumbai
 yahi nahin laash ke saath koi suraksha nahin thi, koi police vaala nahin tha, koi protocol nahin tha
 The driver of the ambulance descends the corpse alone to Gategaon
 jin do jajon ke saath jaj loya gaye the, ve dedh maheene tak parivaar se sampark nahin karte hai
 Those judges also do not come to Gategaon with the corpse of their colleague
 yah video hamen kairavaan patrika ne di he
 In Marathi, Judge Loya's sister Anuradha Biyani is speaking with whom Loya used to talk a lot, asking medicines for trivial matters
 isliye bahan ko pataa tha ki bhai ko kis tarah kii takalif he
 Doctor sister does not agree with the reasons given for the heart attack in the post mortem report
 un kaarnon kaa unke parivaar main koi history nahin he
 The sister has a habit of writing a diary
 ve har din kii baatcheet likhti rahati thim
 That conversation revealed that he allegedly received information from RSS activist Ishwar Baheti
 kairavaan patrika ke reporter ne ishwar baheti se sawaal kiya he magar jawaab nahin aayaa he
 This is the sister who brings Justice Loya's phone to Anuradha Bayani's house a few days later
 anuraadhaa ke man main sawaal daudane lagata he ki jaj kaa phone ek ishwar baheti ko kaise mila
 If the judge dies, then his belongings will be seized and the police will be brought by law
 yahi nahin anuraadhaa kii ek or bahan sarita mandhane ke paas kisi jaj kaa phone aata he
 Sarita was in Latur that day
 bhai kii maut kii khabar milte hi latur ke ek astpal main bhartee apane bhattije ko lene jaati hai
 But there is the same God who flirts with Anuradha's house
 sarita ne dhyaan to nahin diya magar yah sawaal dhans gaya ki ye ishwar baheti koun he jo bhai kii maut kii khabar lekar aata he
 Baheti tells them that there is no need to go to Nagpur
 vahaan se laash ambulance ke zarie getgaanv bheji ja chuki he
 Baheti takes them home
 bahanon ko bahut baat main dhyaan aata he ek jaj kii maut hui he, na police na prashasan
 How does an RSS person know all this much
 jab loya kaa antim sanskaar hota he tab kai jaj shaamil hote hai
 There some judges refuse the wife and son to talk to anyone
 donon ajtak bolne kii himmat nahin juta paae, main samaj saktaa hum, aapako bhi samajhnaa chahie
 All that is needed is to live like that so much to be scared
 dilli main haratosh bal, apurvanand, shabnam hashmi, manisha sethi or saidaa hamid ne press conference kii or puri baat bataai
 Media cameras and reporters are present here, hopefully you will get to read about this news in the newspapers of 23 November
 mumkin he ki media hindu muslim kaa koi neshnal silebus lekar itnaa hangaamaa karegaa ki ye khabar dab jaaegi jaise kisi jaj kii maut kii khabar teen saal tak dabi rahati he
 This is also the fact that when everybody is hesitating to speak on this story, three to four people are holding a press conference and a reporter comes to Niranjan Takle too
 hamaare sahyogi umashankar singh is press conference ko cover karne gaye the
 The question about death is, of course, what is the problem with someone being investigated, why are there so much fear in speaking, are we beginning to embrace fear, it is not good for anyone
 dar baantnaa band kiijie, kisi par shaq bhi karnaa band kiijie lekin jab koi sawaal kar de to sarkaar or adaalat kaa kaam he ki jawaab kaa aashwaasan de or jawaab bhi de
 Based on the talk of sister Anuradha Biyani and based on her investigation, the details that Niranjan Takle has collected related to the night of death are frightening
 jaj loya nagpur ke viipi guestaouse ravi bhawan main tehre the
 Where many judges, many big officials were also staying at that time
 jab seene main dard kii shikaayat hoti he to unhen auto se le jaaya jaataa he
 Was there not a single car in that guest house, how was it taken by auto rickshaw
 ravi bhawan se do kimi kii duuri par auto rickshaw stand hai
 Loya is taken to a hospital where the ECG machine was not working
 vahaan se unhen duusare aspataal main le jaaya jaataa he
 Where he is declared dead
 yah bhi pataa nahin chal paaya he ki justise loya ko aspataal lekar koun gaya
 Who took a judge from the VIP guest house with him in an auto
 jab maut hui thi tab media main khabar chhapi thi, dil kaa daura padane se maut kii khabar ko sabane saamaanya taur par liya
 No one was suspicious
 magar anuraadhaa biani or niranjan taakale apni padtaal se kuch aise sawaal nikaalte hai jo pehali nazar main dekhne par vaaki pathar se bhi zyaada thos lagate hai
 Every page of the post-mortem is signed by a person
 dastakhat ke neeche likhaa he ki yah loya kaa chachera bhai he
 Anuradha Biyani says that she has no cousin
 record ke anusaar loya kaa shav ise saunpa jaataa he
 But only the driver had gone with the corpse in the ambulance
 vah aadmi koun tha or kahaan he is vakt jiskaa dastakhat he
 The comments report bahut lambii he or daraavnee he
 If the questions related to the death of a judge can remain incomplete, then under which system are we living? kairavaan ne ek or report chhaapi he, is report ke baad
 In which it is told that a judge was allegedly offered a bribe of hundred crores to settle this case
 iskaa zikr yahaan nahin kyonki jaj kii maut se jude sawaal abhi khatm nahin hue hai
 You must have understood why there is a snowflake in Delhi
 kya ek jaj kii maut kii jaanch se lekar postermart report tak main itane antar ho sakate hai, sunanda pushkar kii postmortem report to rose tivi par khulti he, khulani bhi chahie magar justise loya ke parivaar waalon ko kya jawaab milegaa
 Two sources from Nagpur's Sitavadi Police Station and Government Medical College told Niranjan Takle that he had seen the body at midnight, his post-mortem was also done at the same time
 magar postmortem report main mrityu kii soochna kaa vakt sava chah baje he
 The post mortem starts at 10:55 am and ends at 1155
 jaahir maut kaa samay or postmart ke samay ko lekar do tarah kii raay he
 Should this report simply be ignored, in whose interest it is to ignore these questions, a judge dies, his son and wife are unable to muster the courage to speak if the Chief Justice of India does not trust him Should be given, they should not be encouraged to speak
 aakhir jab ek naagarik dar ke kaaran jeene kaa, bolne kaa hausala chhod degaa to koun hausala degaa
 Have we made the sheet of fear that it will scare us and we will keep sleeping on that sheet of fear, we will tremble with fear under it, the question is simple, judges hear all kinds of cases
 bahut mushkil he kahana ki kisi kii hatya kaa sambandh kis maamle se the magar kya yah jaananaa zaruri nahin ki ek jaj kii maut ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai, uske jawaab kab or kaise milenge
 If anyone is afraid of the context of this story, then no one can find answers to the questions related to the death of the judge, regardless of the context
 ek aam naagarik ke liye bhi jawaab zaruri he
 Otherwise everyone will feel that when this can happen to a judge then it can happen to someone
 main bhi aapse ek baat kahana chahta hum
 i was also scared but did it so that Anuradha Biyani did not feel that her brother was killed by anyone and there was no one to speak
 loya ke bete ko ye na lage ki is desh main koi kisi ke liye bolta nahin he
 It's not like this
 mujhe ummid he koi bole na bole, pradhanmantri or bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish zarur bolenge ki darane kii baat nahin he
 Questions that will be investigated
 is report kaa asar kisi rahasyamayi thriller sa he jise patrakarita ke course main padhaayaa janaa chahie
 Those who are studying journalism by paying five lakh fees should project on it
 kai baar vaazib kaarnon se bhi hota he ki duusare santhaan kii story ko haath lagane se pehle intazaar karte hai
 This is completely fine as well, but surprisingly, even after two days of printing, no sound was heard from the corridors of the courts

 Where should the judges have time, if they had studied, what should they have done, can the file of questions related to the death of a judge not open again

 magar postmortem report main mrityu kii soochna kaa vakt sava chah baje he
 The post mortem starts at 10:55 am and ends at 1155
 jaahir maut kaa samay or postmart ke samay ko lekar do tarah kii raay he
 Should this report simply be ignored, in whose interest it is to ignore these questions, a judge dies, his son and wife are unable to muster the courage to speak if the Chief Justice of India does not trust him Should be given, they should not be encouraged to speak
 aakhir jab ek naagarik dar ke kaaran jeene kaa, bolne kaa hausala chhod degaa to koun hausala degaa
 Have we made the sheet of fear that it will scare us and we will keep sleeping on that sheet of fear, we will tremble with fear under it, the question is simple, judges hear all kinds of cases
 bahut mushkil he kahana ki kisi kii hatya kaa sambandh kis maamle se the magar kya yah jaananaa zaruri nahin ki ek jaj kii maut ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai, uske jawaab kab or kaise milenge
 If anyone is afraid of the context of this story, then no one can find answers to the questions related to the death of the judge, regardless of the context
 ek aam naagarik ke liye bhi jawaab zaruri he
 Otherwise everyone will feel that when this can happen to a judge then it can happen to someone
 main bhi aapse ek baat kahana chahta hum
 i was also scared but did it so that Anuradha Biyani did not feel that her brother was killed by anyone and there was no one to speak
 loya ke bete ko ye na lage ki is desh main koi kisi ke liye bolta nahin he
 It's not like this
 mujhe ummid he koi bole na bole, pradhanmantri or bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish zarur bolenge ki darane kii baat nahin he
 Questions that will be investigated
 jajon ke paas vakt kahaan hota he, agar padhi hoti to unhen kya karnaa chahie tha, kya ek jaj kii maut se jude sawaalon kii file dobaaraa nahin khul sakati he
 Shouldn't the court have given this assurance to the law minister, to the acting guardian of the country, the Prime Minister
 kya vipaksh ko sawaal nahin karnaa chahie tha
 Shouldn't everyone give an assurance that we will investigate this or else the people inside the judiciary will lose their trust, otherwise people outside the judiciary will not have confidence in the people sitting inside
 patni apane pati or betaa apane pita kii maut par khamosh ho gaye
 Their fear may have been reasonable, but Justice Loya's doctor sister dared to say it after three years
 lekin jab ek bahan ne baat kah di, ek reporter ne report chhap di, ek patrika ne use logon tak pahunchaa diya to phir dilli main patrakaron or nyaay jagat ke logon kii jubaan par barf kii silli kyon jam gai he
 Story is scary
 maine is story ko padhane vaale patrakaron ko darate dekha he
 i was shocked to find out whether the death of a judge was really death or that someone was murdered
 nagpur main 1 disambar 2014 kii subah jaj brijagopal loya kii maut dil kaa daura padane se bataai jaati he
 Three years later, her sister's questions pierce her bones, she seems to have been murdered by someone and the killer is comfortably watching TV
 usne kairavaan kii story chupake se padhi to hogi
 It is possible that to cover this story, a storm of hindu-muslim issues may arise in Delhi, there may be issues where there is a war between Maulana and anchors on TV, but whenever the storm stops, the story starts to shine
 patrakarita kaa ek daayitv yah bhi he jab saare log kisi story ko mara hua chhod kar chale jaaen to bahut dinon baad vahaan lautaa jaae or dekha jaae ki vahaan kuch or suraag to nahin tha

 Kannada newspaper Varta Bharati and Madhyam, a newspaper published in Malayalam, have covered this report
 dilli ke akhbaaron ke daftar main os pad gaye hai
 We did not investigate this story of Caravan at our level, but when we saw the video statement of CBI Judge Brijgopal Loya's sister, it seemed that at least the story as it is can be told
 sibiai ke special court ke jaj brijagopal loya soharabuddin encounter maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe the, jis maamle main bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah mukhya aaropee the
 On 30 December 2014, CBI Special CBI Judge MB Gosavi acquits Amit Shah of this charge
 sibiai ne is faisle ke kilaaf upree adaalat main apil nahin kii
 Whether it is intended to appeal or not, who will ask
 jab log ek chhapi hui story se dar jate he vahaan koun poochhega ki apil kyon nahin kii ja rahi he
 On June 6, 2014, Special Judge Uptap resentment reveals why Amit Shah did not come
 jaj utpat aadesh dete hai ki amit shah 20 june ko court main haazir hon, nahin aate hai
 Judge Utpat fixes the date of next hearing on June 26 but he is transferred on June 25
 supreme court kaa aadesh he ki soharabuddin maamle main ek hi adhikari shuru se ant tak jaanch or sunwaayee main rahegaa
 Judge Utpat is transferred to Pune
 unki jagah aate hai 48 saal jaj brijagopal harikishan loya
 Judge Loya exempts Amit Shah from the condition of appearing in private
 kehete hai ki ve das hazaar pej kii chargeshit ko phir se dekhnaa chaahate the, nae jaj the isliye or cese samvedansheel tha isliye bhi
 The niece Nupur, who lives with her, has told that there is a lot of tension about this case
 ise kaise samajha jaae, isamen bahut log shaamil hai
 How to deal with it
 bhanji ne yah baat kairavaan ke reporter niranjan taakale ko bataai
 From then onwards Niranjan started investigating this story
 31 aktubar ko jaj loya ne poocha ki amit shah haazir kyon nahin hai
 Shah's lawyer says he has given himself up to not be present
 loya yaad dilaate hai ki chhot tab tha jab shah rajya ke baahar hon, us din shah mumbai main the
 Justice Loya dies in Nagpur on the morning of 1 December 2014
 15 disambar 2014 ko jaj loya ke saamne amit shah kii peshi honi thi
 On 30 December, new judge MG Gosavi acquits Amit Shah from all charges
 faisle main kaha jaataa he ki raajnneetik kaarnon se amit shah ko fansaaya gaya tha
 The reference to Amit Shah in the judge's death story is just a matter of context, to tell how many high profile cases he was hearing, it does not mean that anyone is being pointed out, we are not doing that at all, but For the same reason, it seems that the questions related to the death of Judge Loya should be taken seriously so that no one becomes suspicious
 aakhir unki bahan ko bataanaa to padegaa ki unke sawaalon kaa kya hua
 Judge Loya did not want to go to Nagpur
 vahaan ek jaj kii beti kii shaadi main janaa tha magar do jaj kehete hai ki chalanaa chahie
 They go to Nagpur at his behest
 shaadi se laut kar mumbai main apni patni se baat karte hai or uske baad unke parivaar ko kuch pataa nahin chalata
 a call comes in the morning that Judge Loya has died
 niranjan taakale ne jaj loya kii doctor bahan ke hawaale se jo sawaal or ghatana likhaa he ab aap use padhakar or sunakar sihar jaaenge
 Someone can die of a heart attack, but a judge will die
 From his post-mortem to someone else, the decision to send the corpse to the village near the father instead of sending it to the wife and son's house, will make the question so easy Are not
 ek jaj kaa maamuli baton ke liye protocol hota he
 According to what his sister has told, the family did not decide whether Loya's corpse would go to Mumbai or his village from Nagpur
 bas parivaar ke sadasyon ko phone aata he ki unki laash latur ke getgaanv bheji ja rahi he
 Loya's father lives in Getgaon, Loya's three sisters live in Dhule, Jalgaon and Aurangabad
 akhir kisase puch kar justise loya kii laash mumbai kii jagah getgaanv bheji jaati he
 Not only this, there was no protection with the corpse, there was no police, no protocol
 ebulence kaa dryver akele us laash ko getgaanv lekar utarataa he
 The two judges with whom the judge was taken do not contact the family for a month and a half
 ve jaj bhi apane sahyogi kii laash ke saath getgaanv nahin aate hai
 This video was given to us by Caravan magazine
 marathi main jaj loya kii bahan anuraadhaa biani bol rahi hai jinase loya kaaphi baat karte the, maamuli baton ke liye dawa poochhate the
 So the sister knew what kind of problem the brother had
 postmortem report main dil kaa daura padane ke jo kaaran bataae gaye hai, usase doctor bahan sahamat nahin hai
 Those reasons have no history in his family
 bahan kii aadat he diary likhane kii
 She kept writing every day's conversation
 us baatcheet se pataa chalaa ki unhen maut kii soochna kathith taur par aresas ke kaaryakarta ishwar baheti se milti he
 The reporter of Caravan magazine has questioned Ishwar Baheti but the answer has not come
 yahi baheti he jo kuch dinon baad anuraadhaa bayani ke ghar justise loya kaa phone lekar aata he
 Anuradha's question begins to run in the mind how the judge's phone was received by a god Baheti
 jaj kii maut hogi, to unke saamaanon kii zabti hogi or kaayade se police hi lekar aegi
 Not only this, another judge of Anuradha's sister Sarita Mandhane gets a call from a judge
 sarita us din latur main thi
 As soon as the news of his brother's death is received, he goes to pick up his nephew, who is admitted in a hospital in Latur
 lekin vahaan vahi ishwar baheti miltaa he jo phone lekar anuraadhaa ke ghar gaya tha
 Sarita did not pay attention, but the question was settled as to who is this God who flows and brings news of his brother's death
 baheti unhen kahata he ki nagpur jane kii zarurat nahin he
 From there, the body has been sent to Gategaon via ambulance
 baheti unhen ghar lekar jaataa he
 The sisters get a lot of attention from the fact that one judge has died, neither the police nor the administration
 aresas kaa ek aadmi itnaa sab kuch kaise jaanata he
 Many judges are involved when Loya is cremated
 vahaan kuch jaj patni or bete ko kisi se baat karne se manaa karte hai
 Both of them could not muster the courage to speak till today, i can understand, you should also understand
 bas itnaa hi kahana he ki aisa bhi kya jeena ki itnaa darana chahie
 In Delhi, Hartosh Bal, Apoorvanand, Shabnam Hashmi, Manisha Sethi and Syeda Hameed held a press conference and explained the whole thing
 yahaan media ke camere or reporter to maujuud nazar aa rahe hai, ummid he aapako 23 november ke akhbaaron main is khabar ke bare main padhane ko milegaa
 It is possible that the media will create such a ruckus by taking a national syllabus of Hindu Muslim that this news will be suppressed as if the news of the death of a judge is buried for three years
 yahi khubi bhi he ki jab sab log is story par bolne se kataraa rahe hai teen chaar log press conference kar rahe hai or ek reporter niranjan taakale bhi aata he to yah story kar detaa he
 Our colleague Umashankar Singh went to cover this press conference
 maut ko lekar sawaal hi to he, zaahir he jaanch hone main kisi ko kya dikkat he, bolne main itnaa dar kyon hai, kya ham dar ko gale lagane lage hai, yah kisi ke liye acha nahin he
 Stop sharing fear, stop doubting anyone, but when someone asks a question, it is the job of the government and the court to give assurance and answer
 bahan anuraadhaa biani kii baton or apni jaanch ke aadhaar par niranjan taakale ne maut kii raat se jude jo detail jutaaye hai, wo daraane vaale hai
 Judge Loya stayed at Nagpur's VIP guesthouse Ravi Bhavan
 jahaan us vakt kai jaj, kai bade adhikari bhi tehre the
 They are taken by auto when there are complaints of chest pain
 kya us guest house main ek bhi gaadi nahin thi, auto rickshaw se kaise le jaaya gaya
 There are auto rickshaw stands two km from Ravi Bhavan
 loya ko ek aise aspataal main le jaaya jaataa he jahaan isiji mashin kaam nahin kar rahi thi
 From there he is taken to another hospital
 jahaan unhen mrit ghoshit kar diya jaataa he
 It is also not known who took Justice Loya to the hospital
 viipi guest house se ek jaj ko auto main bithakar koun le gaya tha
 When the death took place, there was a news in the media, everyone took the news of the death due to a heart attack
 kisi ko shaq bhi nahin hua
 But Anuradha Biyani and Niranjan Takle draw out some questions from their investigations that at first glance look really more concrete than stone
 postmortem ke har panne par ek vyakti ke dastakhat he
 It is written under the sign that it is Loya's cousin
 anuraadhaa biani kahati hai ki unka koi chachera bhai nahin he
 According to the records, the body of Loya is assigned to it
 magar ambulance main laash lekar to sirf driver gaya tha
 Who was the man and where is he signed at the moment
 tippaniyan The report is very long and scary
 agar ek jaj kii maut se jude sawaal adhure rah sakate hai to ham kis vyavastha main ji rahe hai
 Caravan has published another report, following this report
 jisamen bataaya he ki ek jaj ko is cese ko nipataane ke liye sau karod ke rishwat kii kathith rup se peshkash hui thi
 It is not mentioned here because the questions related to the death of the judge are not over yet
 aap samaj gaye honge ki kyon dilli par barf kii silli padi he
 Can there be so much difference between the investigation of a judge's death and the post-mortem report, Sunanda Pushkar's post-mortem report opens on TV every day, it should also be opened but what answer will be given to the family of Justice Loya
 nagpur ke sitavdi police stesan or sarkari medical college ke do sutron ne niranjan taakale ko bataaya ki unhone aadhi raat ko hi shav dekh liya tha, uskaa postmortem bhi usee vakt kar liya gaya tha
 But in the post-mortem report, the time of the notice of death is six and a quarter
 postmortem shuru hota he 10 bajkar 55 minute par or khatm hota he 11 bajkar 55 minute par
 There are obviously two types of opinion about the time of death and the time of postmart
 kya is report ko yun hi andekha kar diya janaa chahie, kiske hit main in sawaalon ko andekha karnaa, ek jaj kii maut hoti he, unka betaa or patni bolne kaa saahas nahin juta pate to kya bharat ke pramukh nyaayadhish ko unhen suraksha kaa bharosa nahin dena chahie, unhen bolne kaa hausala nahin dena chahie
 After all, when a citizen will give up the courage to live, to speak because of fear, then who will give encouragement
 kya satta ko hamane dar kaa chadar bana liya he ki wo daraati rahegi or ham us dar kii chadar ko taan kar sote rahenge, uske neeche dar se kaanpate rahenge, sawaal simpal he, jaj tamaam tarah ke maamalon kii sunwaayee karte hai
 It is very difficult to say what was the matter related to the murder of someone, but it is not necessary to know that questions are being raised about the death of a judge, when and how to get his answers
 agar is story ke sandarbh se kisi ko dar he to kya bina sandarbh ke parvaah kiye sirf jaj kii maut se jude sawaalon kaa jawaab nahi khoja saktaa he
 The answer is also important for a common citizen
 varanaa sabko lagegaa ki jab ek jaj ke saath aisa ho saktaa he to phir kisi ke saath ho saktaa he
 i also want to tell you one thing
 mujhe bhi dar laga tha, lekin isliye ise kiya taaki anuraadhaa biani ko ye na lage ki uske bhai ko kisi ne maar diya or bolne vaala koi nahin tha
 Loya's son does not feel that in this country no one speaks for anyone
 aisa nahin he
 i hope no one says, the Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India will surely say that there is nothing to fear
 jo sawaal hai unki jaanch hogi
 The wife became silent on the death of her husband and son
 unka dar vaazib hi rahaa hoga, magar justise loya kii doctor bahan ne teen saal baad kehane kii himmat juta lee
 But when a sister spoke, a reporter printed the report, a magazine gave it to the people, then why is the snow capped on the tongue of journalists and people of justice in Delhi
 story daraavnee to he
 i have seen journalists reading this story in awe
 main khud sihar gaya ki kya ek jaj kii maut vaaki maut thi yaa kisi ne hatya kar di
 On the morning of 1 December 2014 in Nagpur, Judge Brijgopal Loya is reported to have died of a heart attack
 teen saal baad unki bahan ke sawaal haddiyon main chhed kar dete hai, lagata he ki unki kisi ne hatya kar di or hatyara aaraam se tivi dekh rahaa he
 He must have read the caravan story secretly
 mumkin he is story par pardaa daalane ke liye dilli main hindu muslim muddon kii aandhi chal jaae, aise masale aa jaaen jahaan tivi par moulana or ankaron ke bich jang chhid jaae lekin jab bhi aandhi thamati he wo story jhalkane lagati he
 It is also an obligation of journalism when all the people leave a story dead and then return to it after a long time and see if there was any more clue
 aap niranjan taakale kii is story ko caravanmagazine
 can read on com
 angrezi main he or lambii bhi he
 Scroll it after the caravan
 in or the wire
 in has also printed hindi main aap the wirehindi
 com, mediavigil
 com par is story ko pard sakate hai
 indiasamvad
 co
 in has also added a new angle to this story
 kannada akhbaar vaartabharati or malayalam main chhapane vaala akhbaar madhyamum ne is report ko cover kiya he
 Dew are in the offices of newspapers in Delhi
 kairavaan kii is story kii jaanch hamane apane str par nahin kii magar jab sibiai ke jaj brijagopal loya kii bahan kaa video bayaan dekha to laga ki kam se kam jaisi story he use us rup main bataaya ja saktaa he
 CBI Special Court Judge Brijgopal Loya was hearing the Sohrabuddin encounter case in which BJP national president Amit Shah was the main accused
 30 disambar 2014 ko sibiai ke special sibiai jaj embi gosaavi amit shah ko is aarope se bari kar dete hai
 The CBI did not appeal against this decision in the Upper Court
 apil karne kaa iraadaa he bhi yaa nahin, koun poochhega
 When people get scared of a printed story, who will ask why the appeal is not being made
 6 june 2014 ko special jaj utpat naaraazgi zaahir karte hai ki amit shah kyon nahin aae
 The judge orders that Amit Shah should appear in court on June 20, not come
 jaj utpat agali sunwaayee kii tarikh 26 june tay karte hai magar 25 june ko unka tabadalaa ho jaataa he
 The Supreme Court has ordered that the same officer in the Sohrabuddin case will remain in the investigation and hearing from beginning to end
 jaj utpat kaa tabadalaa pune ho jaataa he
 In his place comes 48 years Judge Brijgopal Harikshan Loya
 jaj loya amit shah ko nijee taur par haazir hone kii shart se chhot de dete hai
 It is said that they wanted to revisit the charge sheet of ten thousand pages, new judges were so and case sensitive as well
 unke saath rahane vaali bhanji nupur ne bataaya he ki is cese ko lekar bahut tanaav he
 There are many people involved in how to understand it
 isse kaise nipta jaae
 Bhanji told this to Niranjan Takle, a reporter for Caravan
 usee ke baad se niranjan ne is kahani kii padtaal shuru kar di
 On October 31, Judge Loya asked why Amit Shah is not present
 shah ke vakil kehete hai ki unhone khud haazir naa hone kii chhot di he
 Loya reminds that the exemption was when Shah was outside the state, on that day Shah was in Mumbai
 1 disambar 2014 kii subah nagpur main justise loya kii maut hoti he
 On December 15, 2014, Amit Shah was to appear before Judge Loya
 30 disambar ko nae jaj emji gosaavi amit shah ko sabhi aaropon se bari kar dete hai
 The verdict states that Amit Shah was implicated for political reasons
 jaj kii maut vaali story main amit shah kaa zikr sirf sandarbh kii baat he, bataane ke liye ve kitne hai profile maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe the, iskaa matlab yah nahin ki kisi par ishaara kiya ja rahaa he, wo ham bilkul nahin kar rahe magar isi ek kaaran se yah bhi lagata he ki jaj loya kii maut se jude sawaalon ko gambhirtha se lenaa chahie taaki kisi ko shaq na ho
 After all, his sister will have to tell what happened to her questions
 jaj loya nagpur nahin janaa chaahate the
 a judge's daughter was to go to the wedding there, but two judges say that she should walk
 unke kehane par ve nagpur jate hai
 After returning from marriage, he talks to his wife in Mumbai and after that his family does not know anything
 subah ek phone aata he ki jaj loya mar gaye hai
 Now you will go to Sihar after reading and listening to the question and incident written by Niranjan Takle referring to the doctor sister of Judge Loya
 kisi kii maut dil kaa daura padane se ho sakati he magar ek jaj kii maut hogi uske postmortem se lekar laash ko patni or bete ke ghar bhejne kii jagah baap ke paas gaanv bhejne kaa faisla koi or kar legaa, yah sab sawaal itani aasaani se hajam nahin hote hai
 a judge has a protocol for trivia
 unki bahan ne jo baat bataai he unke anusaar parivaar kaa faisla nahin tha ki nagpur se loya kii laash mumbai jaaegi yaa unke gaanv
 Just family members get a call that their corpse is being sent to Gategaon in Latur
 getgaanv main loya ke pita rahete hai, loya kii teen bahanen dhule, jalgaanv or aurangabad main rahati hai
 After asking whom, Justice Loya's body is sent to Gategaon instead of Mumbai
 yahi nahin laash ke saath koi suraksha nahin thi, koi police vaala nahin tha, koi protocol nahin tha
 The driver of the ambulance descends the corpse alone to Gategaon
 jin do jajon ke saath jaj loya gaye the, ve dedh maheene tak parivaar se sampark nahin karte hai
 Those judges also do not come to Gategaon with the corpse of their colleague
 yah video hamen kairavaan patrika ne di he
 In Marathi, Judge Loya's sister Anuradha Biyani is speaking with whom Loya used to talk a lot, asking medicines for trivial matters
 isliye bahan ko pataa tha ki bhai ko kis tarah kii takalif he
 Doctor sister does not agree with the reasons given for the heart attack in the post mortem report
 un kaarnon kaa unke parivaar main koi history nahin he
 The sister has a habit of writing a diary
 ve har din kii baatcheet likhti rahati thim
 That conversation revealed that he allegedly received information from RSS activist Ishwar Baheti
 kairavaan patrika ke reporter ne ishwar baheti se sawaal kiya he magar jawaab nahin aayaa he
 This is the sister who brings Justice Loya's phone to Anuradha Bayani's house a few days later
 anuraadhaa ke man main sawaal daudane lagata he ki jaj kaa phone ek ishwar baheti ko kaise mila
 If the judge dies, then his belongings will be seized and the police will be brought by law
 yahi nahin anuraadhaa kii ek or bahan sarita mandhane ke paas kisi jaj kaa phone aata he
 Sarita was in Latur that day
 bhai kii maut kii khabar milte hi latur ke ek astpal main bhartee apane bhattije ko lene jaati hai
 But there is the same God who flirts with Anuradha's house
 sarita ne dhyaan to nahin diya magar yah sawaal dhans gaya ki ye ishwar baheti koun he jo bhai kii maut kii khabar lekar aata he
 Baheti tells them that there is no need to go to Nagpur
 vahaan se laash ambulance ke zarie getgaanv bheji ja chuki he
 Baheti takes them home
 bahanon ko bahut baat main dhyaan aata he ek jaj kii maut hui he, na police na prashasan
 How does an RSS person know all this much
 jab loya kaa antim sanskaar hota he tab kai jaj shaamil hote hai
 There some judges refuse the wife and son to talk to anyone
 donon ajtak bolne kii himmat nahin juta paae, main samaj saktaa hum, aapako bhi samajhnaa chahie
 All that is needed is to live like that so much to be scared
 dilli main haratosh bal, apurvanand, shabnam hashmi, manisha sethi or saidaa hamid ne press conference kii or puri baat bataai
 Media cameras and reporters are present here, hopefully you will get to read about this news in the newspapers of 23 November
 mumkin he ki media hindu muslim kaa koi neshnal silebus lekar itnaa hangaamaa karegaa ki ye khabar dab jaaegi jaise kisi jaj kii maut kii khabar teen saal tak dabi rahati he
 This is also the fact that when everybody is hesitating to speak on this story, three to four people are holding a press conference and a reporter comes to Niranjan Takle too
 hamaare sahyogi umashankar singh is press conference ko cover karne gaye the
 The question about death is, of course, what is the problem with someone being investigated, why are there so much fear in speaking, are we beginning to embrace fear, it is not good for anyone
 dar baantnaa band kiijie, kisi par shaq bhi karnaa band kiijie lekin jab koi sawaal kar de to sarkaar or adaalat kaa kaam he ki jawaab kaa aashwaasan de or jawaab bhi de
 Based on the talk of sister Anuradha Biyani and based on her investigation, the details that Niranjan Takle has collected related to the night of death are frightening
 jaj loya nagpur ke viipi guestaouse ravi bhawan main tehre the
 Where many judges, many big officials were also staying at that time
 jab seene main dard kii shikaayat hoti he to unhen auto se le jaaya jaataa he
 Was there not a single car in that guest house, how was it taken by auto rickshaw
 ravi bhawan se do kimi kii duuri par auto rickshaw stand hai
 Loya is taken to a hospital where the ECG machine was not working
 vahaan se unhen duusare aspataal main le jaaya jaataa he
 Where he is declared dead
 yah bhi pataa nahin chal paaya he ki justise loya ko aspataal lekar koun gaya
 Who took a judge from the VIP guest house with him in an auto
 jab maut hui thi tab media main khabar chhapi thi, dil kaa daura padane se maut kii khabar ko sabane saamaanya taur par liya
 No one was suspicious
 magar anuraadhaa biani or niranjan taakale apni padtaal se kuch aise sawaal nikaalte hai jo pehali nazar main dekhne par vaaki pathar se bhi zyaada thos lagate hai
 Every page of the post-mortem is signed by a person
 dastakhat ke neeche likhaa he ki yah loya kaa chachera bhai he
 Anuradha Biyani says that she has no cousin
 record ke anusaar loya kaa shav ise saunpa jaataa he
 But only the driver had gone with the corpse in the ambulance
 vah aadmi koun tha or kahaan he is vakt jiskaa dastakhat he
 The comments report bahut lambii he or daraavnee he
 If the questions related to the death of a judge can remain incomplete, then under which system are we living? kairavaan ne ek or report chhaapi he, is report ke baad
 In which it is told that a judge was allegedly offered a bribe of hundred crores to settle this case
 iskaa zikr yahaan nahin kyonki jaj kii maut se jude sawaal abhi khatm nahin hue hai
 You must have understood why there is a snowflake in Delhi
 kya ek jaj kii maut kii jaanch se lekar postermart report tak main itane antar ho sakate hai, sunanda pushkar kii postmortem report to rose tivi par khulti he, khulani bhi chahie magar justise loya ke parivaar waalon ko kya jawaab milegaa
 Two sources from Nagpur's Sitavadi Police Station and Government Medical College told Niranjan Takle that he had seen the body at midnight, his post-mortem was also done at the same time
 magar postmortem report main mrityu kii soochna kaa vakt sava chah baje he
 The post mortem starts at 10:55 am and ends at 1155
 jaahir maut kaa samay or postmart ke samay ko lekar do tarah kii raay he
 Should this report simply be ignored, in whose interest it is to ignore these questions, a judge dies, his son and wife are unable to muster the courage to speak if the Chief Justice of India does not trust him Should be given, they should not be encouraged to speak
 aakhir jab ek naagarik dar ke kaaran jeene kaa, bolne kaa hausala chhod degaa to koun hausala degaa
 Have we made the sheet of fear that it will scare us and we will keep sleeping on that sheet of fear, we will tremble with fear under it, the question is simple, judges hear all kinds of cases
 bahut mushkil he kahana ki kisi kii hatya kaa sambandh kis maamle se the magar kya yah jaananaa zaruri nahin ki ek jaj kii maut ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai, uske jawaab kab or kaise milenge
 If anyone is afraid of the context of this story, then no one can find answers to the questions related to the death of the judge, regardless of the context
 ek aam naagarik ke liye bhi jawaab zaruri he
 Otherwise everyone will feel that when this can happen to a judge then it can happen to someone
 main bhi aapse ek baat kahana chahta hum
 i was also scared but did it so that Anuradha Biyani did not feel that her brother was killed by anyone and there was no one to speak
 loya ke bete ko ye na lage ki is desh main koi kisi ke liye bolta nahin he
 It's not like this

 Questions that will be investigated
 nagpur main 1 disambar 2014 kii subah jaj brijagopal loya kii maut dil kaa daura padane se bataai jaati he
 Three years later, her sister's questions pierce her bones, she seems to have been murdered by someone and the killer is comfortably watching TV
 usne kairavaan kii story chupake se padhi to hogi
 It is possible that to cover this story, a storm of hindu-muslim issues may arise in Delhi, there may be issues where there is a war between Maulana and anchors on TV, but whenever the storm stops, the story starts to shine
 patrakarita kaa ek daayitv yah bhi he jab saare log kisi story ko mara hua chhod kar chale jaaen to bahut dinon baad vahaan lautaa jaae or dekha jaae ki vahaan kuch or suraag to nahin tha

 We did not investigate this story of Caravan at our level, but when we saw the video statement of CBI Judge Brijgopal Loya's sister, it seemed that at least the story as it is can be told

 From then onwards Niranjan started investigating this story

 Justice Loya dies in Nagpur on the morning of 1 December 2014
 15 disambar 2014 ko jaj loya ke saamne amit shah kii peshi honi thi
 On 30 December, new judge MG Gosavi acquits Amit Shah from all charges
 faisle main kaha jaataa he ki raajnneetik kaarnon se amit shah ko fansaaya gaya tha
 The reference to Amit Shah in the judge's death story is just a matter of context, to tell how many high profile cases he was hearing, it does not mean that anyone is being pointed out, we are not doing that at all, but For the same reason, it seems that the questions related to the death of Judge Loya should be taken seriously so that no one becomes suspicious
 aakhir unki bahan ko bataanaa to padegaa ki unke sawaalon kaa kya hua
 Judge Loya did not want to go to Nagpur
 vahaan ek jaj kii beti kii shaadi main janaa tha magar do jaj kehete hai ki chalanaa chahie
 They go to Nagpur at his behest
 shaadi se laut kar mumbai main apni patni se baat karte hai or uske baad unke parivaar ko kuch pataa nahin chalata
 a call comes in the morning that Judge Loya has died
 niranjan taakale ne jaj loya kii doctor bahan ke hawaale se jo sawaal or ghatana likhaa he ab aap use padhakar or sunakar sihar jaaenge
 Someone can die of a heart attack, but a judge will die
 From his post-mortem to someone else, the decision to send the corpse to the village near the father instead of sending it to the wife and son's house, will make the question so easy Are not
 ek jaj kaa maamuli baton ke liye protocol hota he
 According to what his sister has told, the family did not decide whether Loya's corpse would go to Mumbai or his village from Nagpur 
 bas parivaar ke sadasyon ko phone aata he ki unki laash latur ke getgaanv bheji ja rahi he
 Loya's father lives in Getgaon, Loya's three sisters live in Dhule, Jalgaon and Aurangabad
 akhir kisase puch kar justise loya kii laash mumbai kii jagah getgaanv bheji jaati he
 Not only this, there was no protection with the corpse, there was no police, no protocol
 ebulence kaa dryver akele us laash ko getgaanv lekar utarataa he
 The two judges with whom the judge was taken do not contact the family for a month and a half
 ve jaj bhi apane sahyogi kii laash ke saath getgaanv nahin aate hai
 This video was given to us by Caravan magazine
 marathi main jaj loya kii bahan anuraadhaa biani bol rahi hai jinase loya kaaphi baat karte the, maamuli baton ke liye dawa poochhate the
 So the sister knew what kind of problem the brother had
 postmortem report main dil kaa daura padane ke jo kaaran bataae gaye hai, usase doctor bahan sahamat nahin hai
 Those reasons have no history in his family
 bahan kii aadat he diary likhane kii
 She kept writing every day's conversation
 us baatcheet se pataa chalaa ki unhen maut kii soochna kathith taur par aresas ke kaaryakarta ishwar baheti se milti he
 The reporter of Caravan magazine has questioned Ishwar Baheti but the answer has not come
 yahi baheti he jo kuch dinon baad anuraadhaa bayani ke ghar justise loya kaa phone lekar aata he
 Anuradha's question begins to run in the mind how the judge's phone was received by a god Baheti
 jaj kii maut hogi, to unke saamaanon kii zabti hogi or kaayade se police hi lekar aegi
 Not only this, another judge of Anuradha's sister Sarita Mandhane gets a call from a judge
 sarita us din latur main thi
 As soon as the news of his brother's death is received, he goes to pick up his nephew, who is admitted in a hospital in Latur
 lekin vahaan vahi ishwar baheti miltaa he jo phone lekar anuraadhaa ke ghar gaya tha
 Sarita did not pay attention, but the question was settled as to who is this God who flows and brings news of his brother's death
 baheti unhen kahata he ki nagpur jane kii zarurat nahin he
 From there, the body has been sent to Gategaon via ambulance
 baheti unhen ghar lekar jaataa he
 The sisters get a lot of attention from the fact that one judge has died, neither the police nor the administration
 aresas kaa ek aadmi itnaa sab kuch kaise jaanata he
 Many judges are involved when Loya is cremated
 vahaan kuch jaj patni or bete ko kisi se baat karne se manaa karte hai
 Both of them could not muster the courage to speak till today, i can understand, you should also understand
 bas itnaa hi kahana he ki aisa bhi kya jeena ki itnaa darana chahie
 In Delhi, Hartosh Bal, Apoorvanand, Shabnam Hashmi, Manisha Sethi and Syeda Hameed held a press conference and explained the whole thing
 yahaan media ke camere or reporter to maujuud nazar aa rahe hai, ummid he aapako 23 november ke akhbaaron main is khabar ke bare main padhane ko milegaa
 It is possible that the media will create such a ruckus by taking a national syllabus of Hindu Muslim that this news will be suppressed as if the news of the death of a judge is buried for three years
 yahi khubi bhi he ki jab sab log is story par bolne se kataraa rahe hai teen chaar log press conference kar rahe hai or ek reporter niranjan taakale bhi aata he to yah story kar detaa he
 Our colleague Umashankar Singh went to cover this press conference
 maut ko lekar sawaal hi to he, zaahir he jaanch hone main kisi ko kya dikkat he, bolne main itnaa dar kyon hai, kya ham dar ko gale lagane lage hai, yah kisi ke liye acha nahin he
 Stop sharing fear, stop doubting anyone, but when someone asks a question, it is the job of the government and the court to give assurance and answer
 bahan anuraadhaa biani kii baton or apni jaanch ke aadhaar par niranjan taakale ne maut kii raat se jude jo detail jutaaye hai, wo daraane vaale hai
 Judge Loya stayed at Nagpur's VIP guesthouse Ravi Bhavan
 jahaan us vakt kai jaj, kai bade adhikari bhi tehre the
 They are taken by auto when there are complaints of chest pain
 kya us guest house main ek bhi gaadi nahin thi, auto rickshaw se kaise le jaaya gaya
 There are auto rickshaw stands two km from Ravi Bhavan
 loya ko ek aise aspataal main le jaaya jaataa he jahaan isiji mashin kaam nahin kar rahi thi
 From there he is taken to another hospital
 jahaan unhen mrit ghoshit kar diya jaataa he
 It is also not known who took Justice Loya to the hospital
 viipi guest house se ek jaj ko auto main bithakar koun le gaya tha
 When the death took place, there was a news in the media, everyone took the news of the death due to a heart attack
 kisi ko shaq bhi nahin hua
 But Anuradha Biyani and Niranjan Takle draw out some questions from their investigations that at first glance look really more concrete than stone
 postmortem ke har panne par ek vyakti ke dastakhat he
 It is written under the sign that it is Loya's cousin
 anuraadhaa biani kahati hai ki unka koi chachera bhai nahin he
 According to the records, the body of Loya is assigned to it
 magar ambulance main laash lekar to sirf driver gaya tha
 Who was the man and where is he signed at the moment
 tippaniyan The report is very long and scary
 agar ek jaj kii maut se jude sawaal adhure rah sakate hai to ham kis vyavastha main ji rahe hai
 Caravan has published another report, following this report
 jisamen bataaya he ki ek jaj ko is cese ko nipataane ke liye sau karod ke rishwat kii kathith rup se peshkash hui thi
 It is not mentioned here because the questions related to the death of the judge are not over yet
 aap samaj gaye honge ki kyon dilli par barf kii silli padi he
 Can there be so much difference between the investigation of a judge's death and the post-mortem report, Sunanda Pushkar's post-mortem report opens on TV every day, it should also be opened but what answer will be given to the family of Justice Loya
 nagpur ke sitavdi police stesan or sarkari medical college ke do sutron ne niranjan taakale ko bataaya ki unhone aadhi raat ko hi shav dekh liya tha, uskaa postmortem bhi usee vakt kar liya gaya tha
 But in the post-mortem report, the time of the notice of death is six and a quarter
 postmortem shuru hota he 10 bajkar 55 minute par or khatm hota he 11 bajkar 55 minute par
 There are obviously two types of opinion about the time of death and the time of postmart
 kya is report ko yun hi andekha kar diya janaa chahie, kiske hit main in sawaalon ko andekha karnaa, ek jaj kii maut hoti he, unka betaa or patni bolne kaa saahas nahin juta pate to kya bharat ke pramukh nyaayadhish ko unhen suraksha kaa bharosa nahin dena chahie, unhen bolne kaa hausala nahin dena chahie
 After all, when a citizen will give up the courage to live, to speak because of fear, then who will give encouragement
 kya satta ko hamane dar kaa chadar bana liya he ki wo daraati rahegi or ham us dar kii chadar ko taan kar sote rahenge, uske neeche dar se kaanpate rahenge, sawaal simpal he, jaj tamaam tarah ke maamalon kii sunwaayee karte hai
 It is very difficult to say what was the matter related to the murder of someone, but it is not necessary to know that questions are being raised about the death of a judge, when and how to get his answers
 agar is story ke sandarbh se kisi ko dar he to kya bina sandarbh ke parvaah kiye sirf jaj kii maut se jude sawaalon kaa jawaab nahi khoja saktaa he
 The answer is also important for a common citizen
 varanaa sabko lagegaa ki jab ek jaj ke saath aisa ho saktaa he to phir kisi ke saath ho saktaa he
 i also want to tell you one thing
 mujhe bhi dar laga tha, lekin isliye ise kiya taaki anuraadhaa biani ko ye na lage ki uske bhai ko kisi ne maar diya or bolne vaala koi nahin tha
 Loya's son does not feel that in this country no one speaks for anyone
 aisa nahin he
 i hope no one says, the Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India will surely say that there is nothing to fear
 jo sawaal hai unki jaanch hogi

 bas parivaar ke sadasyon ko phone aata he ki unki laash latur ke getgaanv bheji ja rahi he
 Loya's father lives in Getgaon, Loya's three sisters live in Dhule, Jalgaon and Aurangabad
 akhir kisase puch kar justise loya kii laash mumbai kii jagah getgaanv bheji jaati he
 Not only this, there was no protection with the corpse, there was no police, no protocol
 ebulence kaa dryver akele us laash ko getgaanv lekar utarataa he
 The two judges with whom the judge was taken do not contact the family for a month and a half
 ve jaj bhi apane sahyogi kii laash ke saath getgaanv nahin aate hai
 This video was given to us by Caravan magazine
 marathi main jaj loya kii bahan anuraadhaa biani bol rahi hai jinase loya kaaphi baat karte the, maamuli baton ke liye dawa poochhate the
 So the sister knew what kind of problem the brother had
 postmortem report main dil kaa daura padane ke jo kaaran bataae gaye hai, usase doctor bahan sahamat nahin hai
 Those reasons have no history in his family
 bahan kii aadat he diary likhane kii
 She kept writing every day's conversation
 us baatcheet se pataa chalaa ki unhen maut kii soochna kathith taur par aresas ke kaaryakarta ishwar baheti se milti he
 The reporter of Caravan magazine has questioned Ishwar Baheti but the answer has not come
 yahi baheti he jo kuch dinon baad anuraadhaa bayani ke ghar justise loya kaa phone lekar aata he
 Anuradha's question begins to run in the mind how the judge's phone was received by a god Baheti
 jaj kii maut hogi, to unke saamaanon kii zabti hogi or kaayade se police hi lekar aegi
 Not only this, another judge of Anuradha's sister Sarita Mandhane gets a call from a judge
 sarita us din latur main thi
 As soon as the news of his brother's death is received, he goes to pick up his nephew, who is admitted in a hospital in Latur
 lekin vahaan vahi ishwar baheti miltaa he jo phone lekar anuraadhaa ke ghar gaya tha
 Sarita did not pay attention, but the question was settled as to who is this God who flows and brings news of his brother's death
 baheti unhen kahata he ki nagpur jane kii zarurat nahin he
 From there, the body has been sent to Gategaon via ambulance
 baheti unhen ghar lekar jaataa he
 The sisters get a lot of attention from the fact that one judge has died, neither the police nor the administration
 aresas kaa ek aadmi itnaa sab kuch kaise jaanata he
 Many judges are involved when Loya is cremated
 vahaan kuch jaj patni or bete ko kisi se baat karne se manaa karte hai
 Both of them could not muster the courage to speak till today, i can understand, you should also understand
 bas itnaa hi kahana he ki aisa bhi kya jeena ki itnaa darana chahie
 In Delhi, Hartosh Bal, Apoorvanand, Shabnam Hashmi, Manisha Sethi and Syeda Hameed held a press conference and explained the whole thing
 yahaan media ke camere or reporter to maujuud nazar aa rahe hai, ummid he aapako 23 november ke akhbaaron main is khabar ke bare main padhane ko milegaa
 It is possible that the media will create such a ruckus by taking a national syllabus of Hindu Muslim that this news will be suppressed as if the news of the death of a judge is buried for three years
 yahi khubi bhi he ki jab sab log is story par bolne se kataraa rahe hai teen chaar log press conference kar rahe hai or ek reporter niranjan taakale bhi aata he to yah story kar detaa he
 Our colleague Umashankar Singh went to cover this press conference
 maut ko lekar sawaal hi to he, zaahir he jaanch hone main kisi ko kya dikkat he, bolne main itnaa dar kyon hai, kya ham dar ko gale lagane lage hai, yah kisi ke liye acha nahin he
 Stop sharing fear, stop doubting anyone, but when someone asks a question, it is the job of the government and the court to give assurance and answer
 bahan anuraadhaa biani kii baton or apni jaanch ke aadhaar par niranjan taakale ne maut kii raat se jude jo detail jutaaye hai, wo daraane vaale hai
 Judge Loya stayed at Nagpur's VIP guesthouse Ravi Bhavan
 jahaan us vakt kai jaj, kai bade adhikari bhi tehre the
 They are taken by auto when there are complaints of chest pain
 kya us guest house main ek bhi gaadi nahin thi, auto rickshaw se kaise le jaaya gaya
 There are auto rickshaw stands two km from Ravi Bhavan
 loya ko ek aise aspataal main le jaaya jaataa he jahaan isiji mashin kaam nahin kar rahi thi
 From there he is taken to another hospital
 jahaan unhen mrit ghoshit kar diya jaataa he
 It is also not known who took Justice Loya to the hospital
 viipi guest house se ek jaj ko auto main bithakar koun le gaya tha
 When the death took place, there was a news in the media, everyone took the news of the death due to a heart attack
 kisi ko shaq bhi nahin hua
 But Anuradha Biyani and Niranjan Takle draw out some questions from their investigations that at first glance look really more concrete than stone
 postmortem ke har panne par ek vyakti ke dastakhat he
 It is written under the sign that it is Loya's cousin
 anuraadhaa biani kahati hai ki unka koi chachera bhai nahin he
 According to the records, the body of Loya is assigned to it
 magar ambulance main laash lekar to sirf driver gaya tha
 Who was the man and where is he signed at the moment
 tippaniyan The report is very long and scary
 agar ek jaj kii maut se jude sawaal adhure rah sakate hai to ham kis vyavastha main ji rahe hai
 Caravan has published another report, following this report
 jisamen bataaya he ki ek jaj ko is cese ko nipataane ke liye sau karod ke rishwat kii kathith rup se peshkash hui thi
 It is not mentioned here because the questions related to the death of the judge are not over yet
 aap samaj gaye honge ki kyon dilli par barf kii silli padi he
 Can there be so much difference between the investigation of a judge's death and the post-mortem report, Sunanda Pushkar's post-mortem report opens on TV every day, it should also be opened but what answer will be given to the family of Justice Loya
 nagpur ke sitavdi police stesan or sarkari medical college ke do sutron ne niranjan taakale ko bataaya ki unhone aadhi raat ko hi shav dekh liya tha, uskaa postmortem bhi usee vakt kar liya gaya tha
 But in the post-mortem report, the time of the notice of death is six and a quarter
 postmortem shuru hota he 10 bajkar 55 minute par or khatm hota he 11 bajkar 55 minute par
 There are obviously two types of opinion about the time of death and the time of postmart
 kya is report ko yun hi andekha kar diya janaa chahie, kiske hit main in sawaalon ko andekha karnaa, ek jaj kii maut hoti he, unka betaa or patni bolne kaa saahas nahin juta pate to kya bharat ke pramukh nyaayadhish ko unhen suraksha kaa bharosa nahin dena chahie, unhen bolne kaa hausala nahin dena chahie
 After all, when a citizen will give up the courage to live, to speak because of fear, then who will give encouragement
 kya satta ko hamane dar kaa chadar bana liya he ki wo daraati rahegi or ham us dar kii chadar ko taan kar sote rahenge, uske neeche dar se kaanpate rahenge, sawaal simpal he, jaj tamaam tarah ke maamalon kii sunwaayee karte hai
 It is very difficult to say what was the matter related to the murder of someone, but it is not necessary to know that questions are being raised about the death of a judge, when and how to get his answers
 agar is story ke sandarbh se kisi ko dar he to kya bina sandarbh ke parvaah kiye sirf jaj kii maut se jude sawaalon kaa jawaab nahi khoja saktaa he
 The answer is also important for a common citizen
 varanaa sabko lagegaa ki jab ek jaj ke saath aisa ho saktaa he to phir kisi ke saath ho saktaa he
 i also want to tell you one thing
 mujhe bhi dar laga tha, lekin isliye ise kiya taaki anuraadhaa biani ko ye na lage ki uske bhai ko kisi ne maar diya or bolne vaala koi nahin tha
 Loya's son does not feel that in this country no one speaks for anyone
 aisa nahin he
 i hope no one says, the Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India will surely say that there is nothing to fear
 jo sawaal hai unki jaanch hogi
 On June 6, 2014, Special Judge Uptap resentment reveals why Amit Shah did not come
 jaj utpat aadesh dete hai ki amit shah 20 june ko court main haazir hon, nahin aate hai
 Judge Utpat fixes the date of next hearing on June 26 but he is transferred on June 25
 supreme court kaa aadesh he ki soharabuddin maamle main ek hi adhikari shuru se ant tak jaanch or sunwaayee main rahegaa
 Judge Utpat is transferred to Pune
 unki jagah aate hai 48 saal jaj brijagopal harikishan loya
 Judge Loya exempts Amit Shah from the condition of appearing in private
 kehete hai ki ve das hazaar pej kii chargeshit ko phir se dekhnaa chaahate the, nae jaj the isliye or cese samvedansheel tha isliye bhi
 The niece Nupur, who lives with her, has told that there is a lot of tension about this case
 ise kaise samajha jaae, isamen bahut log shaamil hai
 How to deal with it
 bhanji ne yah baat kairavaan ke reporter niranjan taakale ko bataai
 From then onwards Niranjan started investigating this story
 31 aktubar ko jaj loya ne poocha ki amit shah haazir kyon nahin hai
 Shah's lawyer says he has given himself up to not be present
 loya yaad dilaate hai ki chhot tab tha jab shah rajya ke baahar hon, us din shah mumbai main the
 Justice Loya dies in Nagpur on the morning of 1 December 2014
 15 disambar 2014 ko jaj loya ke saamne amit shah kii peshi honi thi
 On 30 December, new judge MG Gosavi acquits Amit Shah from all charges
 faisle main kaha jaataa he ki raajnneetik kaarnon se amit shah ko fansaaya gaya tha
 The reference to Amit Shah in the judge's death story is just a matter of context, to tell how many high profile cases he was hearing, it does not mean that anyone is being pointed out, we are not doing that at all, but For the same reason, it seems that the questions related to the death of Judge Loya should be taken seriously so that no one becomes suspicious
 aakhir unki bahan ko bataanaa to padegaa ki unke sawaalon kaa kya hua
 Judge Loya did not want to go to Nagpur
 vahaan ek jaj kii beti kii shaadi main janaa tha magar do jaj kehete hai ki chalanaa chahie
 They go to Nagpur at his behest
 shaadi se laut kar mumbai main apni patni se baat karte hai or uske baad unke parivaar ko kuch pataa nahin chalata
 a call comes in the morning that Judge Loya has died
 niranjan taakale ne jaj loya kii doctor bahan ke hawaale se jo sawaal or ghatana likhaa he ab aap use padhakar or sunakar sihar jaaenge
 Someone can die of a heart attack, but a judge will die
 From his post-mortem to someone else, the decision to send the corpse to the village near the father instead of sending it to the wife and son's house, will make the question so easy Are not
 ek jaj kaa maamuli baton ke liye protocol hota he
 According to what his sister has told, the family did not decide whether Loya's corpse would go to Mumbai or his village from Nagpur

 Not only this, there was no protection with the corpse, there was no police, no protocol

 Bhanji told this to Niranjan Takle, a reporter for Caravan
 usee ke baad se niranjan ne is kahani kii padtaal shuru kar di
 On October 31, Judge Loya asked why Amit Shah is not present
 shah ke vakil kehete hai ki unhone khud haazir naa hone kii chhot di he
 Loya reminds that the exemption was when Shah was outside the state, on that day Shah was in Mumbai
 1 disambar 2014 kii subah nagpur main justise loya kii maut hoti he
 On December 15, 2014, Amit Shah was to appear before Judge Loya
 30 disambar ko nae jaj emji gosaavi amit shah ko sabhi aaropon se bari kar dete hai
 The verdict states that Amit Shah was implicated for political reasons
 jaj kii maut vaali story main amit shah kaa zikr sirf sandarbh kii baat he, bataane ke liye ve kitne hai profile maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe the, iskaa matlab yah nahin ki kisi par ishaara kiya ja rahaa he, wo ham bilkul nahin kar rahe magar isi ek kaaran se yah bhi lagata he ki jaj loya kii maut se jude sawaalon ko gambhirtha se lenaa chahie taaki kisi ko shaq na ho
 After all, his sister will have to tell what happened to her questions
 jaj loya nagpur nahin janaa chaahate the
 a judge's daughter was to go to the wedding there, but two judges say that she should walk
 unke kehane par ve nagpur jate hai
 After returning from marriage, he talks to his wife in Mumbai and after that his family does not know anything
 subah ek phone aata he ki jaj loya mar gaye hai
 Now you will go to Sihar after reading and listening to the question and incident written by Niranjan Takle referring to the doctor sister of Judge Loya
 kisi kii maut dil kaa daura padane se ho sakati he magar ek jaj kii maut hogi uske postmortem se lekar laash ko patni or bete ke ghar bhejne kii jagah baap ke paas gaanv bhejne kaa faisla koi or kar legaa, yah sab sawaal itani aasaani se hajam nahin hote hai
 a judge has a protocol for trivia
 unki bahan ne jo baat bataai he unke anusaar parivaar kaa faisla nahin tha ki nagpur se loya kii laash mumbai jaaegi yaa unke gaanv
 Just family members get a call that their corpse is being sent to Gategaon in Latur
 getgaanv main loya ke pita rahete hai, loya kii teen bahanen dhule, jalgaanv or aurangabad main rahati hai
 After asking whom, Justice Loya's body is sent to Gategaon instead of Mumbai
 yahi nahin laash ke saath koi suraksha nahin thi, koi police vaala nahin tha, koi protocol nahin tha
 The driver of the ambulance descends the corpse alone to Gategaon
 jin do jajon ke saath jaj loya gaye the, ve dedh maheene tak parivaar se sampark nahin karte hai
 Those judges also do not come to Gategaon with the corpse of their colleague
 yah video hamen kairavaan patrika ne di he
 In Marathi, Judge Loya's sister Anuradha Biyani is speaking with whom Loya used to talk a lot, asking medicines for trivial matters
 isliye bahan ko pataa tha ki bhai ko kis tarah kii takalif he
 Doctor sister does not agree with the reasons given for the heart attack in the post mortem report
 un kaarnon kaa unke parivaar main koi history nahin he
 The sister has a habit of writing a diary
 ve har din kii baatcheet likhti rahati thim
 That conversation revealed that he allegedly received information from RSS activist Ishwar Baheti
 kairavaan patrika ke reporter ne ishwar baheti se sawaal kiya he magar jawaab nahin aayaa he
 This is the sister who brings Justice Loya's phone to Anuradha Bayani's house a few days later
 anuraadhaa ke man main sawaal daudane lagata he ki jaj kaa phone ek ishwar baheti ko kaise mila
 If the judge dies, then his belongings will be seized and the police will be brought by law
 yahi nahin anuraadhaa kii ek or bahan sarita mandhane ke paas kisi jaj kaa phone aata he
 Sarita was in Latur that day
 bhai kii maut kii khabar milte hi latur ke ek astpal main bhartee apane bhattije ko lene jaati hai
 But there is the same God who flirts with Anuradha's house
 sarita ne dhyaan to nahin diya magar yah sawaal dhans gaya ki ye ishwar baheti koun he jo bhai kii maut kii khabar lekar aata he
 Baheti tells them that there is no need to go to Nagpur
 vahaan se laash ambulance ke zarie getgaanv bheji ja chuki he
 Baheti takes them home
 bahanon ko bahut baat main dhyaan aata he ek jaj kii maut hui he, na police na prashasan
 How does an RSS person know all this much
 jab loya kaa antim sanskaar hota he tab kai jaj shaamil hote hai
 There some judges refuse the wife and son to talk to anyone
 donon ajtak bolne kii himmat nahin juta paae, main samaj saktaa hum, aapako bhi samajhnaa chahie
 All that is needed is to live like that so much to be scared
 dilli main haratosh bal, apurvanand, shabnam hashmi, manisha sethi or saidaa hamid ne press conference kii or puri baat bataai
 Media cameras and reporters are present here, hopefully you will get to read about this news in the newspapers of 23 November
 mumkin he ki media hindu muslim kaa koi neshnal silebus lekar itnaa hangaamaa karegaa ki ye khabar dab jaaegi jaise kisi jaj kii maut kii khabar teen saal tak dabi rahati he
 This is also the fact that when everybody is hesitating to speak on this story, three to four people are holding a press conference and a reporter comes to Niranjan Takle too
 hamaare sahyogi umashankar singh is press conference ko cover karne gaye the
 The question about death is, of course, what is the problem with someone being investigated, why are there so much fear in speaking, are we beginning to embrace fear, it is not good for anyone
 dar baantnaa band kiijie, kisi par shaq bhi karnaa band kiijie lekin jab koi sawaal kar de to sarkaar or adaalat kaa kaam he ki jawaab kaa aashwaasan de or jawaab bhi de
 Based on the talk of sister Anuradha Biyani and based on her investigation, the details that Niranjan Takle has collected related to the night of death are frightening
 jaj loya nagpur ke viipi guestaouse ravi bhawan main tehre the
 Where many judges, many big officials were also staying at that time
 jab seene main dard kii shikaayat hoti he to unhen auto se le jaaya jaataa he
 Was there not a single car in that guest house, how was it taken by auto rickshaw
 ravi bhawan se do kimi kii duuri par auto rickshaw stand hai
 Loya is taken to a hospital where the ECG machine was not working
 vahaan se unhen duusare aspataal main le jaaya jaataa he
 Where he is declared dead
 yah bhi pataa nahin chal paaya he ki justise loya ko aspataal lekar koun gaya
 Who took a judge from the VIP guest house with him in an auto
 jab maut hui thi tab media main khabar chhapi thi, dil kaa daura padane se maut kii khabar ko sabane saamaanya taur par liya
 No one was suspicious
 magar anuraadhaa biani or niranjan taakale apni padtaal se kuch aise sawaal nikaalte hai jo pehali nazar main dekhne par vaaki pathar se bhi zyaada thos lagate hai
 Every page of the post-mortem is signed by a person
 dastakhat ke neeche likhaa he ki yah loya kaa chachera bhai he
 Anuradha Biyani says that she has no cousin
 record ke anusaar loya kaa shav ise saunpa jaataa he
 But only the driver had gone with the corpse in the ambulance
 vah aadmi koun tha or kahaan he is vakt jiskaa dastakhat he
 The comments report bahut lambii he or daraavnee he
 If the questions related to the death of a judge can remain incomplete, then under which system are we living? kairavaan ne ek or report chhaapi he, is report ke baad
 In which it is told that a judge was allegedly offered a bribe of hundred crores to settle this case
 iskaa zikr yahaan nahin kyonki jaj kii maut se jude sawaal abhi khatm nahin hue hai
 You must have understood why there is a snowflake in Delhi
 kya ek jaj kii maut kii jaanch se lekar postermart report tak main itane antar ho sakate hai, sunanda pushkar kii postmortem report to rose tivi par khulti he, khulani bhi chahie magar justise loya ke parivaar waalon ko kya jawaab milegaa
 Two sources from Nagpur's Sitavadi Police Station and Government Medical College told Niranjan Takle that he had seen the body at midnight, his post-mortem was also done at the same time
 magar postmortem report main mrityu kii soochna kaa vakt sava chah baje he
 The post mortem starts at 10:55 am and ends at 1155
 jaahir maut kaa samay or postmart ke samay ko lekar do tarah kii raay he
 Should this report simply be ignored, in whose interest it is to ignore these questions, a judge dies, his son and wife are unable to muster the courage to speak if the Chief Justice of India does not trust him Should be given, they should not be encouraged to speak
 aakhir jab ek naagarik dar ke kaaran jeene kaa, bolne kaa hausala chhod degaa to koun hausala degaa
 Have we made the sheet of fear that it will scare us and we will keep sleeping on that sheet of fear, we will tremble with fear under it, the question is simple, judges hear all kinds of cases
 bahut mushkil he kahana ki kisi kii hatya kaa sambandh kis maamle se the magar kya yah jaananaa zaruri nahin ki ek jaj kii maut ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai, uske jawaab kab or kaise milenge
 If anyone is afraid of the context of this story, then no one can find answers to the questions related to the death of the judge, regardless of the context
 ek aam naagarik ke liye bhi jawaab zaruri he
 Otherwise everyone will feel that when this can happen to a judge then it can happen to someone
 main bhi aapse ek baat kahana chahta hum
 i was also scared but did it so that Anuradha Biyani did not feel that her brother was killed by anyone and there was no one to speak
 loya ke bete ko ye na lage ki is desh main koi kisi ke liye bolta nahin he
 It's not like this
 mujhe ummid he koi bole na bole, pradhanmantri or bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish zarur bolenge ki darane kii baat nahin he
 Questions that will be investigated
 faisle main kaha jaataa he ki raajnneetik kaarnon se amit shah ko fansaaya gaya tha
 The reference to Amit Shah in the judge's death story is just a matter of context, to tell how many high profile cases he was hearing, it does not mean that anyone is being pointed out, we are not doing that at all, but For the same reason, it seems that the questions related to the death of Judge Loya should be taken seriously so that no one becomes suspicious
 aakhir unki bahan ko bataanaa to padegaa ki unke sawaalon kaa kya hua
 Judge Loya did not want to go to Nagpur
 vahaan ek jaj kii beti kii shaadi main janaa tha magar do jaj kehete hai ki chalanaa chahie
 They go to Nagpur at his behest
 shaadi se laut kar mumbai main apni patni se baat karte hai or uske baad unke parivaar ko kuch pataa nahin chalata
 a call comes in the morning that Judge Loya has died
 niranjan taakale ne jaj loya kii doctor bahan ke hawaale se jo sawaal or ghatana likhaa he ab aap use padhakar or sunakar sihar jaaenge
 Someone can die of a heart attack, but a judge will die
 From his post-mortem to someone else, the decision to send the corpse to the village near the father instead of sending it to the wife and son's house, will make the question so easy Are not
 ek jaj kaa maamuli baton ke liye protocol hota he
 According to what his sister has told, the family did not decide whether Loya's corpse would go to Mumbai or his village from Nagpur
 bas parivaar ke sadasyon ko phone aata he ki unki laash latur ke getgaanv bheji ja rahi he
 Loya's father lives in Getgaon, Loya's three sisters live in Dhule, Jalgaon and Aurangabad
 akhir kisase puch kar justise loya kii laash mumbai kii jagah getgaanv bheji jaati he
 Not only this, there was no protection with the corpse, there was no police, no protocol
 ebulence kaa dryver akele us laash ko getgaanv lekar utarataa he
 The two judges with whom the judge was taken do not contact the family for a month and a half
 ve jaj bhi apane sahyogi kii laash ke saath getgaanv nahin aate hai
 This video was given to us by Caravan magazine
 marathi main jaj loya kii bahan anuraadhaa biani bol rahi hai jinase loya kaaphi baat karte the, maamuli baton ke liye dawa poochhate the
 So the sister knew what kind of problem the brother had
 postmortem report main dil kaa daura padane ke jo kaaran bataae gaye hai, usase doctor bahan sahamat nahin hai
 Those reasons have no history in his family
 bahan kii aadat he diary likhane kii
 She kept writing every day's conversation
 us baatcheet se pataa chalaa ki unhen maut kii soochna kathith taur par aresas ke kaaryakarta ishwar baheti se milti he
 The reporter of Caravan magazine has questioned Ishwar Baheti but the answer has not come
 yahi baheti he jo kuch dinon baad anuraadhaa bayani ke ghar justise loya kaa phone lekar aata he
 Anuradha's question begins to run in the mind how the judge's phone was received by a god Baheti
 jaj kii maut hogi, to unke saamaanon kii zabti hogi or kaayade se police hi lekar aegi
 Not only this, another judge of Anuradha's sister Sarita Mandhane gets a call from a judge
 sarita us din latur main thi
 As soon as the news of his brother's death is received, he goes to pick up his nephew, who is admitted in a hospital in Latur
 lekin vahaan vahi ishwar baheti miltaa he jo phone lekar anuraadhaa ke ghar gaya tha
 Sarita did not pay attention, but the question was settled as to who is this God who flows and brings news of his brother's death
 baheti unhen kahata he ki nagpur jane kii zarurat nahin he
 From there, the body has been sent to Gategaon via ambulance
 baheti unhen ghar lekar jaataa he
 The sisters get a lot of attention from the fact that one judge has died, neither the police nor the administration
 aresas kaa ek aadmi itnaa sab kuch kaise jaanata he
 Many judges are involved when Loya is cremated
 vahaan kuch jaj patni or bete ko kisi se baat karne se manaa karte hai
 Both of them could not muster the courage to speak till today, i can understand, you should also understand
 bas itnaa hi kahana he ki aisa bhi kya jeena ki itnaa darana chahie
 In Delhi, Hartosh Bal, Apoorvanand, Shabnam Hashmi, Manisha Sethi and Syeda Hameed held a press conference and explained the whole thing
 yahaan media ke camere or reporter to maujuud nazar aa rahe hai, ummid he aapako 23 november ke akhbaaron main is khabar ke bare main padhane ko milegaa
 It is possible that the media will create such a ruckus by taking a national syllabus of Hindu Muslim that this news will be suppressed as if the news of the death of a judge is buried for three years
 yahi khubi bhi he ki jab sab log is story par bolne se kataraa rahe hai teen chaar log press conference kar rahe hai or ek reporter niranjan taakale bhi aata he to yah story kar detaa he
 Our colleague Umashankar Singh went to cover this press conference
 maut ko lekar sawaal hi to he, zaahir he jaanch hone main kisi ko kya dikkat he, bolne main itnaa dar kyon hai, kya ham dar ko gale lagane lage hai, yah kisi ke liye acha nahin he
 Stop sharing fear, stop doubting anyone, but when someone asks a question, it is the job of the government and the court to give assurance and answer
 bahan anuraadhaa biani kii baton or apni jaanch ke aadhaar par niranjan taakale ne maut kii raat se jude jo detail jutaaye hai, wo daraane vaale hai
 Judge Loya stayed at Nagpur's VIP guesthouse Ravi Bhavan
 jahaan us vakt kai jaj, kai bade adhikari bhi tehre the
 They are taken by auto when there are complaints of chest pain
 kya us guest house main ek bhi gaadi nahin thi, auto rickshaw se kaise le jaaya gaya
 There are auto rickshaw stands two km from Ravi Bhavan
 loya ko ek aise aspataal main le jaaya jaataa he jahaan isiji mashin kaam nahin kar rahi thi
 From there he is taken to another hospital
 jahaan unhen mrit ghoshit kar diya jaataa he
 It is also not known who took Justice Loya to the hospital
 viipi guest house se ek jaj ko auto main bithakar koun le gaya tha
 When the death took place, there was a news in the media, everyone took the news of the death due to a heart attack
 kisi ko shaq bhi nahin hua
 But Anuradha Biyani and Niranjan Takle draw out some questions from their investigations that at first glance look really more concrete than stone
 postmortem ke har panne par ek vyakti ke dastakhat he
 It is written under the sign that it is Loya's cousin
 anuraadhaa biani kahati hai ki unka koi chachera bhai nahin he
 According to the records, the body of Loya is assigned to it
 magar ambulance main laash lekar to sirf driver gaya tha
 Who was the man and where is he signed at the moment
 tippaniyan The report is very long and scary
 agar ek jaj kii maut se jude sawaal adhure rah sakate hai to ham kis vyavastha main ji rahe hai
 Caravan has published another report, following this report
 jisamen bataaya he ki ek jaj ko is cese ko nipataane ke liye sau karod ke rishwat kii kathith rup se peshkash hui thi
 It is not mentioned here because the questions related to the death of the judge are not over yet
 aap samaj gaye honge ki kyon dilli par barf kii silli padi he
 Whether there can be such a difference in the investigation of death of a judge from post-mortem report, Sunanda Pushkar's post-mortem report opens on TV daily, it should also be opened but what answer will be given to the family of Justice Loya
 nagpur ke sitavdi police stesan or sarkari medical college ke do sutron ne niranjan taakale ko bataaya ki unhone aadhi raat ko hi shav dekh liya tha, uskaa postmortem bhi usee vakt kar liya gaya tha
 But in the post-mortem report, the time of the notice of death is six and a quarter
 postmortem shuru hota he 10 bajkar 55 minute par or khatm hota he 11 bajkar 55 minute par
 There are obviously two types of opinion about the time of death and the time of postmart
 kya is report ko yun hi andekha kar diya janaa chahie, kiske hit main in sawaalon ko andekha karnaa, ek jaj kii maut hoti he, unka betaa or patni bolne kaa saahas nahin juta pate to kya bharat ke pramukh nyaayadhish ko unhen suraksha kaa bharosa nahin dena chahie, unhen bolne kaa hausala nahin dena chahie
 After all, when a citizen will give up the courage to live, to speak because of fear, then who will give encouragement
 kya satta ko hamane dar kaa chadar bana liya he ki wo daraati rahegi or ham us dar kii chadar ko taan kar sote rahenge, uske neeche dar se kaanpate rahenge, sawaal simpal he, jaj tamaam tarah ke maamalon kii sunwaayee karte hai
 It is very difficult to say what was the matter related to the murder of someone, but it is not necessary to know that questions are being raised about the death of a judge, when and how to get his answers
 agar is story ke sandarbh se kisi ko dar he to kya bina sandarbh ke parvaah kiye sirf jaj kii maut se jude sawaalon kaa jawaab nahi khoja saktaa he
 The answer is also important for a common citizen
 varanaa sabko lagegaa ki jab ek jaj ke saath aisa ho saktaa he to phir kisi ke saath ho saktaa he
 i also want to tell you one thing
 mujhe bhi dar laga tha, lekin isliye ise kiya taaki anuraadhaa biani ko ye na lage ki uske bhai ko kisi ne maar diya or bolne vaala koi nahin tha
 Loya's son does not feel that in this country no one speaks for anyone
 aisa nahin he
 i hope no one says, the Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India will surely say that there is nothing to fear
 jo sawaal hai unki jaanch hogi
 According to what his sister has told, the family did not decide whether Loya's corpse would go to Mumbai or his village from Nagpur

 If the judge dies, then his belongings will be seized and the police will be brought by law
 yahi nahin anuraadhaa kii ek or bahan sarita mandhane ke paas kisi jaj kaa phone aata he
 Sarita was in Latur that day
 bhai kii maut kii khabar milte hi latur ke ek astpal main bhartee apane bhattije ko lene jaati hai
 But there is the same God who flirts with Anuradha's house
 sarita ne dhyaan to nahin diya magar yah sawaal dhans gaya ki ye ishwar baheti koun he jo bhai kii maut kii khabar lekar aata he
 Baheti tells them that there is no need to go to Nagpur
 vahaan se laash ambulance ke zarie getgaanv bheji ja chuki he
 Baheti takes them home
 bahanon ko bahut baat main dhyaan aata he ek jaj kii maut hui he, na police na prashasan
 How does an RSS person know all this much
 jab loya kaa antim sanskaar hota he tab kai jaj shaamil hote hai
 There some judges refuse the wife and son to talk to anyone
 donon ajtak bolne kii himmat nahin juta paae, main samaj saktaa hum, aapako bhi samajhnaa chahie
 All that is needed is to live like that so much to be scared
 dilli main haratosh bal, apurvanand, shabnam hashmi, manisha sethi or saidaa hamid ne press conference kii or puri baat bataai
 Media cameras and reporters are present here, hopefully you will get to read about this news in the newspapers of 23 November
 mumkin he ki media hindu muslim kaa koi neshnal silebus lekar itnaa hangaamaa karegaa ki ye khabar dab jaaegi jaise kisi jaj kii maut kii khabar teen saal tak dabi rahati he
 This is also the fact that when everybody is hesitating to speak on this story, three to four people are holding a press conference and a reporter comes to Niranjan Takle too
 hamaare sahyogi umashankar singh is press conference ko cover karne gaye the
 The question about death is, of course, what is the problem with someone being investigated, why are there so much fear in speaking, are we beginning to embrace fear, it is not good for anyone
 dar baantnaa band kiijie, kisi par shaq bhi karnaa band kiijie lekin jab koi sawaal kar de to sarkaar or adaalat kaa kaam he ki jawaab kaa aashwaasan de or jawaab bhi de
 Based on the talk of sister Anuradha Biyani and based on her investigation, the details that Niranjan Takle has collected related to the night of death are frightening
 jaj loya nagpur ke viipi guestaouse ravi bhawan main tehre the
 Where many judges, many big officials were also staying at that time
 jab seene main dard kii shikaayat hoti he to unhen auto se le jaaya jaataa he
 Was there not a single car in that guest house, how was it taken by auto rickshaw
 ravi bhawan se do kimi kii duuri par auto rickshaw stand hai
 Loya is taken to a hospital where the ECG machine was not working
 vahaan se unhen duusare aspataal main le jaaya jaataa he
 Where he is declared dead
 yah bhi pataa nahin chal paaya he ki justise loya ko aspataal lekar koun gaya
 Who took a judge from the VIP guest house with him in an auto
 jab maut hui thi tab media main khabar chhapi thi, dil kaa daura padane se maut kii khabar ko sabane saamaanya taur par liya
 No one was suspicious
 magar anuraadhaa biani or niranjan taakale apni padtaal se kuch aise sawaal nikaalte hai jo pehali nazar main dekhne par vaaki pathar se bhi zyaada thos lagate hai
 Every page of the post-mortem is signed by a person
 dastakhat ke neeche likhaa he ki yah loya kaa chachera bhai he
 Anuradha Biyani says that she has no cousin
 record ke anusaar loya kaa shav ise saunpa jaataa he
 But only the driver had gone with the corpse in the ambulance
 vah aadmi koun tha or kahaan he is vakt jiskaa dastakhat he
 The comments report bahut lambii he or daraavnee he
 If the questions related to the death of a judge can remain incomplete, then under which system are we living? kairavaan ne ek or report chhaapi he, is report ke baad
 In which it is told that a judge was allegedly offered a bribe of hundred crores to settle this case
 iskaa zikr yahaan nahin kyonki jaj kii maut se jude sawaal abhi khatm nahin hue hai
 You must have understood why there is a snowflake in Delhi
 kya ek jaj kii maut kii jaanch se lekar postermart report tak main itane antar ho sakate hai, sunanda pushkar kii postmortem report to rose tivi par khulti he, khulani bhi chahie magar justise loya ke parivaar waalon ko kya jawaab milegaa
 Two sources from Nagpur's Sitavadi Police Station and Government Medical College told Niranjan Takle that he had seen the body at midnight, his post-mortem was also done at the same time
 magar postmortem report main mrityu kii soochna kaa vakt sava chah baje he
 The post mortem starts at 10:55 am and ends at 1155
 jaahir maut kaa samay or postmart ke samay ko lekar do tarah kii raay he
 Should this report simply be ignored, in whose interest it is to ignore these questions, a judge dies, his son and wife are unable to muster the courage to speak if the Chief Justice of India does not trust him Should be given, they should not be encouraged to speak
 aakhir jab ek naagarik dar ke kaaran jeene kaa, bolne kaa hausala chhod degaa to koun hausala degaa
 Have we made the sheet of fear that it will scare us and we will keep sleeping on that sheet of fear, we will tremble with fear under it, the question is simple, judges hear all kinds of cases
 bahut mushkil he kahana ki kisi kii hatya kaa sambandh kis maamle se the magar kya yah jaananaa zaruri nahin ki ek jaj kii maut ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai, uske jawaab kab or kaise milenge
 If anyone is afraid of the context of this story, then no one can find answers to the questions related to the death of the judge, regardless of the context
 ek aam naagarik ke liye bhi jawaab zaruri he
 Otherwise everyone will feel that when this can happen to a judge then it can happen to someone
 main bhi aapse ek baat kahana chahta hum
 i was also scared but did it so that Anuradha Biyani did not feel that her brother was killed by anyone and there was no one to speak
 loya ke bete ko ye na lage ki is desh main koi kisi ke liye bolta nahin he
 It's not like this
 mujhe ummid he koi bole na bole, pradhanmantri or bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish zarur bolenge ki darane kii baat nahin he
 Questions that will be investigated
 jab loya kaa antim sanskaar hota he tab kai jaj shaamil hote hai
 There some judges refuse the wife and son to talk to anyone
 donon ajtak bolne kii himmat nahin juta paae, main samaj saktaa hum, aapako bhi samajhnaa chahie
 All that is needed is to live like that so much to be scared
 dilli main haratosh bal, apurvanand, shabnam hashmi, manisha sethi or saidaa hamid ne press conference kii or puri baat bataai
 Media cameras and reporters are present here, hopefully you will get to read about this news in the newspapers of 23 November
 mumkin he ki media hindu muslim kaa koi neshnal silebus lekar itnaa hangaamaa karegaa ki ye khabar dab jaaegi jaise kisi jaj kii maut kii khabar teen saal tak dabi rahati he
 This is also the fact that when everybody is hesitating to speak on this story, three to four people are holding a press conference and a reporter comes to Niranjan Takle too
 hamaare sahyogi umashankar singh is press conference ko cover karne gaye the
 The question about death is, of course, what is the problem with someone being investigated, why are there so much fear in speaking, are we beginning to embrace fear, it is not good for anyone
 dar baantnaa band kiijie, kisi par shaq bhi karnaa band kiijie lekin jab koi sawaal kar de to sarkaar or adaalat kaa kaam he ki jawaab kaa aashwaasan de or jawaab bhi de
 Based on the talk of sister Anuradha Biyani and based on her investigation, the details that Niranjan Takle has collected related to the night of death are frightening
 jaj loya nagpur ke viipi guestaouse ravi bhawan main tehre the
 Where many judges, many big officials were also staying at that time
 jab seene main dard kii shikaayat hoti he to unhen auto se le jaaya jaataa he
 Was there not a single car in that guest house, how was it taken by auto rickshaw
 ravi bhawan se do kimi kii duuri par auto rickshaw stand hai
 Loya is taken to a hospital where the ECG machine was not working
 vahaan se unhen duusare aspataal main le jaaya jaataa he
 Where he is declared dead
 yah bhi pataa nahin chal paaya he ki justise loya ko aspataal lekar koun gaya
 Who took a judge from the VIP guest house with him in an auto
 jab maut hui thi tab media main khabar chhapi thi, dil kaa daura padane se maut kii khabar ko sabane saamaanya taur par liya
 No one was suspicious
 magar anuraadhaa biani or niranjan taakale apni padtaal se kuch aise sawaal nikaalte hai jo pehali nazar main dekhne par vaaki pathar se bhi zyaada thos lagate hai
 Every page of the post-mortem is signed by a person
 dastakhat ke neeche likhaa he ki yah loya kaa chachera bhai he
 Anuradha Biyani says that she has no cousin
 record ke anusaar loya kaa shav ise saunpa jaataa he
 But only the driver had gone with the corpse in the ambulance
 vah aadmi koun tha or kahaan he is vakt jiskaa dastakhat he
 The comments report bahut lambii he or daraavnee he
 If the questions related to the death of a judge can remain incomplete, then under which system are we living? kairavaan ne ek or report chhaapi he, is report ke baad
 In which it is told that a judge was allegedly offered a bribe of hundred crores to settle this case
 iskaa zikr yahaan nahin kyonki jaj kii maut se jude sawaal abhi khatm nahin hue hai

 Questions that will be investigated
 maut ko lekar sawaal hi to he, zaahir he jaanch hone main kisi ko kya dikkat he, bolne main itnaa dar kyon hai, kya ham dar ko gale lagane lage hai, yah kisi ke liye acha nahin he
 Stop sharing fear, stop doubting anyone, but when someone asks a question, it is the job of the government and the court to give assurance and answer
 bahan anuraadhaa biani kii baton or apni jaanch ke aadhaar par niranjan taakale ne maut kii raat se jude jo detail jutaaye hai, wo daraane vaale hai
 Judge Loya stayed at Nagpur's VIP guesthouse Ravi Bhavan
 jahaan us vakt kai jaj, kai bade adhikari bhi tehre the
 They are taken by auto when there are complaints of chest pain
 kya us guest house main ek bhi gaadi nahin thi, auto rickshaw se kaise le jaaya gaya
 There are auto rickshaw stands two km from Ravi Bhavan
 loya ko ek aise aspataal main le jaaya jaataa he jahaan isiji mashin kaam nahin kar rahi thi
 From there he is taken to another hospital
 jahaan unhen mrit ghoshit kar diya jaataa he
 It is also not known who took Justice Loya to the hospital
 viipi guest house se ek jaj ko auto main bithakar koun le gaya tha
 When the death took place, there was a news in the media, everyone took the news of the death due to a heart attack
 kisi ko shaq bhi nahin hua
 But Anuradha Biyani and Niranjan Takle draw out some questions from their investigations that at first glance look really more concrete than stone
 postmortem ke har panne par ek vyakti ke dastakhat he
 It is written under the sign that it is Loya's cousin
 anuraadhaa biani kahati hai ki unka koi chachera bhai nahin he
 According to the records, the body of Loya is assigned to it
 magar ambulance main laash lekar to sirf driver gaya tha
 Who was the man and where is he signed at the moment
 tippaniyan The report is very long and scary
 agar ek jaj kii maut se jude sawaal adhure rah sakate hai to ham kis vyavastha main ji rahe hai
 Caravan has published another report, following this report
 jisamen bataaya he ki ek jaj ko is cese ko nipataane ke liye sau karod ke rishwat kii kathith rup se peshkash hui thi
 It is not mentioned here because the questions related to the death of the judge are not over yet
 aap samaj gaye honge ki kyon dilli par barf kii silli padi he
 Can there be so much difference between the investigation of a judge's death and the post-mortem report, Sunanda Pushkar's post-mortem report opens on TV every day, it should also be opened but what answer will be given to the family of Justice Loya
 nagpur ke sitavdi police stesan or sarkari medical college ke do sutron ne niranjan taakale ko bataaya ki unhone aadhi raat ko hi shav dekh liya tha, uskaa postmortem bhi usee vakt kar liya gaya tha
 But in the post-mortem report, the time of the notice of death is six and a quarter
 postmortem shuru hota he 10 bajkar 55 minute par or khatm hota he 11 bajkar 55 minute par
 There are obviously two types of opinion about the time of death and the time of postmart
 kya is report ko yun hi andekha kar diya janaa chahie, kiske hit main in sawaalon ko andekha karnaa, ek jaj kii maut hoti he, unka betaa or patni bolne kaa saahas nahin juta pate to kya bharat ke pramukh nyaayadhish ko unhen suraksha kaa bharosa nahin dena chahie, unhen bolne kaa hausala nahin dena chahie
 After all, when a citizen will give up the courage to live, to speak because of fear, then who will give encouragement
 kya satta ko hamane dar kaa chadar bana liya he ki wo daraati rahegi or ham us dar kii chadar ko taan kar sote rahenge, uske neeche dar se kaanpate rahenge, sawaal simpal he, jaj tamaam tarah ke maamalon kii sunwaayee karte hai
 It is very difficult to say what was the matter related to the murder of someone, but it is not necessary to know that questions are being raised about the death of a judge, when and how to get his answers
 agar is story ke sandarbh se kisi ko dar he to kya bina sandarbh ke parvaah kiye sirf jaj kii maut se jude sawaalon kaa jawaab nahi khoja saktaa he
 The answer is also important for a common citizen
 varanaa sabko lagegaa ki jab ek jaj ke saath aisa ho saktaa he to phir kisi ke saath ho saktaa he
 i also want to tell you one thing
 mujhe bhi dar laga tha, lekin isliye ise kiya taaki anuraadhaa biani ko ye na lage ki uske bhai ko kisi ne maar diya or bolne vaala koi nahin tha
 Loya's son does not feel that in this country no one speaks for anyone
 aisa nahin he
 i hope no one says, the Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India will surely say that there is nothing to fear
 jo sawaal hai unki jaanch hogi

 aakhir jab ek naagarik dar ke kaaran jeene kaa, bolne kaa hausala chhod degaa to koun hausala degaa
 Have we made the sheet of fear that it will scare us and we will keep sleeping on that sheet of fear, we will tremble with fear under it, the question is simple, judges hear all kinds of cases

 If anyone is afraid of the context of this story, then no one can find answers to the questions related to the death of the judge, regardless of the context
 ek aam naagarik ke liye bhi jawaab zaruri he
 Otherwise everyone will feel that when this can happen to a judge then it can happen to someone

 In fact, the journalist questioned the Chief Minister that in his speech in Kerala on Sunday, Narendra Modi showed some special love for the Dalit class

 Congress President Sonia Gandhi held a meeting with senior ministers and party leaders on Friday amid opposition from the opposition targeting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over the CAG report, including the coal block allocation

 The opposition demanded the Prime Minister's resignation, taking moral, political and personal responsibility for the loss caused by the allocation of the coal block
 congress bifrig main party pravaktaa manish tiwari ne bhaajapa kii is maang ko anaavashyak or raajnneetik laabh uthaane kaa prayaas bataate hue khaarij kar diya
 Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal has also rejected the CAG report on the allocation of coal blocks to private companies by direct allocation by way of 1
 86 lakh karod rupee kaa phayda hua
 Jaiswal rejected the CAG report, saying the policy was transparent in this regard and nothing went wrong
 unhone kaha ki koyala blokon ke aavanton ke liye apanaai gai niti main khami nahin thi
 This could not be transparent and policy because there was no competitive bidding system in 2004
 congress pravaktaa tiwari ne bhaajapa par doharaa maandand apnaane kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha ki pradeshon ke liye unka ek aacharan or kendra ke liye doosraa aacharan hota he
 When the CAG speaks of the upsets of the Gujarat and Chhattisgarh government, the tone of the opposition is different and when it is related to any department of the central government, the tone of the BJP is something else
 unhone kaha ki kendra sarkaar ne koyala blaakon ke aavanton main kuch galat nahin kiya he
 He said that when states' opinions were taken, bjp-ruled Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh as well as Left-ruled West Bengal opposed the auction process

 ' andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu ne somvaar ko kaha ki ve 23 may yani voton kii ginati ke din tak gaiyr-bijepi gathbandhan ke liye apni koshishen jari rakhenge
 Naidu also said that he would take his fight to a logical conclusion
 dhyaan rahe ki ye vahi chandrababu naidu hai jo bijepi ke divangat netaa atal bihari vaajapeyi ke samay endie ke pehle sanyojak the, lekin aaj vakt badal chukaa he or endie ke saath unke rishte ab vaise nahin rahe
 Efforts to unite the parties standing in opposition to the BJP have been continuing for a long time
 haalanki haal ke kuch dinon main zyada teji ai he
 Especially after the exit poll survey, he increased his pace further
 naidu sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (upie) kii adhyaksh sonia gandhi or congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi, bahujan samaaj party (bispi) pramukh mayawati, samaajawaadee party (sapa) pramukh akhilesh yadav sahit kai vipakshi netaaon se mil chuke hai
 Why Naidu's campaign accelerated? The answer to the above question is hidden in the results of the exit poll on Sunday
 andhra pradesh main loksabhaa ke saath vidhansabha ke chunaav bhi hue hai lekin isamen dikkat ye he ki adhiktar agsit pols ne jagan mohan reddy kii wiesarsipi ko 12-15 or naidu kii party tidipi ko 10-13 loksabhaa siten di hai
 Most exit polls predicted that the NDA would form the government by winning close to 300 seats
 naidu chunki endie se khuleam apni dushmani saadh chuke hai, isliye endie kii 300 siten unhen andhra pradesh se lekar dilli tak pareshaan karti najar aa rahi hai
 In such a situation, there is no option left to them to form a common alliance with the opposition parties and maintain their utility
 iske liye ve taal thonk kar kehete najar aa rahe hai ki 'andhrapradesh main nihsandeh tidipi sarkaar banegi or hamen bharosa he ki gaiyr-bijepi partiyaan centre main gaiyr-bijepi sarkaar banaaengi
 According to the exit poll, Naidu may have a slight decrease in seats, but another aspect is that there can be a huge increase in YSR Congress seats
 is kaaran chandrababu naidu ek saath do morchon par jujhate dikh rahe hai
 One in the Lok Sabha and the other in the Andhra Legislative Assembly
 donon jagah kaa sambhavit ghaataa unhen vipakshi kheme main khinchne ko majaboor karata najar aa rahaa he
 Naidu's contact with all opposition leaders is hardly any of the opposition parties that Chandrababu Naidu has not met recently
 unhone shanivaar ko sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav or bahujan samaaj party supremeo mayawati se mulaakaat kii
 In the SP office, the conversation between him and Akhilesh Yadav lasted for about 70 minutes
 naidu iske baad mayawati ke maal avenue sthit awaas pahunche
 Senior BSP leader Satish Chandra Mishra was also present there
 mayawati ne guladaste ke saath naidu kaa swaagat kiya
 Her meeting with Mayawati lasted for over an hour
 haalanki baatcheet kaa falsafa kya rahaa, abhi yah pataa nahin chal paaya he
 On Saturday morning, he met Congress President Rahul Gandhi at his residence and then met Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) President Sharad Pawar and Democratic Janata Dal leader Sharad Yadav to discuss possible alliances
 unhone marxvaadi communist party netaa seetaram yechuri, aam aadmi party ke pramukh arvind kejariwal se shuukravaar ko mulaakaat kar chunaav ke nattejey aane ke baad gathbandhan kii sambhaavnaaon ko lekar baatcheet kii
 By interacting with opposition leaders who are not comfortable with each other, Naidu has clearly become an arbitrator
 endie ke sanyojak rah chuke hai naidutidipi pramukh chandrababu naidu atal bihari vaajapeyi ke samay endie ke pehle sanyojak the
 His name was among the nda's most powerful allies but he became estranged from the BJP over granting special status to Andhra Pradesh
 ek taraf bijepi kaa daawa he ki andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya ke badale special package dene kaa vaada kiya gaya tha or andhra pradesh ko is mad main kaaphi bajet bhi diya gaya
 Whereas Naidu has been calling it a blatant lie of the BJP government
 naidu ne andhra pradesh kii maang ko lekar dilli main anshan bhi kiya or bijepi par dabaav banane kii koshish kii
 Gradually, both parties grew bitter and as a result TDP first removed its ministers from the Modi government and later broke away from the NDA
 loksabhaa chunaav aate aate donon partiyon kii dushmani kaaphi bad gai or ek duusare ke khilaaf prachand chunaav prachaar main utar gaye
 Naidu did not stop here and sought cooperation from all those parties who have been staunch opponents of the BJP to form an anti-bjp alliance
 naidu kii koshishen ab bhi jari hai
 Now it has to be seen whether any anti-bjp front is formed after the results on May 23 or the Modi government again takes over the power of the Center
 chunavi rigelt hi naidu kii aage kii raajnneeti kaa rasta saaf karegaa

 Ever-rivals India and Pakistan have not met face-to-face in bilateral series on the cricket pitch for a long time
 is par purv pakistani tej gendbaaj shoeb akhtar kaa dard jhalka he
 Shoaib Akhtar blamed the politics of both countries for this
 akhtar kaa maananaa he ki bharat or pakistan ke cricketron ko raajnneeti ke kaaran donon deshon ke bich aitihaasik pratidwandvita ke maukey se vanchit kiya ja rahaa he
 He said, "there is no fault of anyone (BCCI or PCB) in this, both boards want the series to happen
" siries hoti he, to yah unke paksh main he
 "significantly, no full bilateral series have been played between the two countries since 2007, in which the 2008 Mumbai terror attack played an important role
" bharat main 2012 main ek choti siries kaa aayojan hua, lekin rajanyik rishton main maujuuda talkhi ko dekhte hue jald hi donon deshon ke bich purna cricket sambandh shuru hone kii sambhaavna nahin he
 According to the news agency PTI, Akhtar told that it is very sad that cricketers on both sides of the border are not getting much opportunities to experience indo-pak rivalry
 ashes ke saath yah khel kii sabase badi siries he
 He said that the cricketers are not getting the opportunity to become heroes for their country overnight
 pakistani cricketron ko bharat main kaaphi pyaar miltaa he, mujhe bhi bharat se kaaphi pyaar mila
 "shoaib said that i want the current Pakistan cricketers to experience the love we got in India and show our talent
" ’’ akhtar khud ko bhaagyashaalee maanate hai ki vah kai baar bharat-paak pratidwandvita kaa hissaa rahe
 During this time he also took advantage of the opportunities and became an overnight star by dismissing Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar in consecutive balls during the 1999 Asian Test Championship in Kolkata
 rawalpindi express ke naam se mashhoor akhtar ne kaha ki bharat-paak cricket hona chahie, lekin agar aisa nahin ho rahaa to logon ko aage bad janaa chahie or bayaan dene se bachanaa chahie
 He said that i think the bilateral series will not take place until the bilateral dialogue between the two countries begins
 or maujuuda sthiti main kisi ko nahin pataa ki cricket kootneeti kaam karegi yaa nahin
 Akhtar said that neither of the two boards can be held responsible for the current situation

 trump ke liye piem modi kaa chunaav abhiyaan bharat or america donon raashtra ke loktantr kaa ulanghan he

 main ek abhinayta hum, jo alag-alag bhoomikaayen nibhaataa he or main yahi karata hum
 For me, this is the only role played on screen
 ' Before Saif, the people of Pakistan have been hating on Sunny Deol a little, because in the film Ghadar, Sunny hit the Pakistanis on the screen by uprooting the hand pump
 uske alaava film indian ho yaa da hero, yaa phir film border, aisi kai filmon main sani deol parade par kabhi pakistan se bheje gaye aatankwaad se lade to kabhi pakistan kii fuj ko unhone dhul chataayee

 ) shaadi ke baad couples main aksar paison ko lekar manmutav hota he
 The views of the two people getting married can vary from money to money
 yah bahut had tak nirbhar karata he ki unki parvarish kaise hui he yaa phir ve kin paristhitiyon main paley-bade hai
 Later, in most of the relationships, money issues are caused by stress, quarrels and anxiety
 aise main behatar yahi rahata he ki shaadi se pehle hi financial muddon par khulkar baatcheet kii jaae
 This is necessary in both cases of love marriage and arranged marriage
 agar aap apane life partner ko lambey samay se nahin jaanate hai to ho saktaa he ki paison se jude sawaal poochne main aap thodaa asahaj rahen
 But the matter is about your future and it is also true that even a small amount of money can become a big issue between you
 isliye paison se jude ye 5 sawaal shaadi ke liye haa karne se pehle jarur puch len
 To make the situation a little easier, you can also discuss these issues one by one: 1) How much your parents have given in childhood in terms of money, try to know from your partner what about the money in their house The outlook is there and how much they value savings
 unase puuchhen ki padhai, lambey vaikeshans or bade kharche kaise manage kiye jate the
 Have their parents made a big mistake regarding money? Are they financially paying attention to the elders of the house
 in sabhi sawaalon ke jawaab aap donon ko ek-duusare ke financial becoground ko samajhane main madad karenge
 2) Question about making loan and hobby a career
 We all have certain responsibilities related to money
 masalan agar parents ne aapaki padhai ke liye lone liya he to vah aapako chukaana hi he
 He may have given this amount from his retirement money
 iske alaava bhavishya main agar aap naukari chhodkar apane kisi pishan ko profeshan banane kaa sapana dekh rahe hai to is bare main bhi charchaa karnaa jaruri he
 3) Do you check the limit of the card while spending? The spending habits between the couples later become a big reason for discord
 isliye kai sawaal jaise- aap credit card par kitna kharch karte hai, kya aap apni limit se zyada kharch karte hai
 Have you borrowed or borrowed money from a friend or bank? aap sirf bachat hi karte hai yaa phir kahin nivesh bhi kiya hua he
 After knowing all this from them, compare it with your habits and then see if both of you will be able to walk on a track
 4) paison se judi bhavishya kii planning par bhi karen batghar khareednaa, bacchon kii planning, ritairement or immergency fund - in chaaron masalon par khulkar apane life partner se baat karen
 With this, if you have any idea of studying even after marriage, then express your wish beforehand
 yah bhi jaanane kii koshish karen ki uski praathamikta kya he, badi car yaa bacchon ke padhai ke liye paise bachaana
 Also ask about investment planning
 ho saktaa he ki ekadam aapako kuch samaj na aae lekin uske vyavhaar va soch ko samajhane main aap jarur kaamyaab rahenge
 5) Take the expenses of wedding and honeymoon too
 Openly tell your partner what you think about the expenses of the wedding
 agar aap apni bachat kaa ek bada hissaa isamen kharch karne kii soch rahe hai to usko yah baat jarur bataaen
 Most problems related to marriage are solved with honest answers and open dialogue
 lihaaja paison se sambandhit apni khwaahish or daayaron ke bare main hone vaale partner ko behichak bataaen
 In spite of the strictness of the Supreme Court, the incidents of mob lynching in India are not taking its name
 ab gujarat ke dahod main bheed ne ek yuvak kii chori karne ke shaq main peet-petakar hatya kar di, jabaki duusare yuvak ko gambhir rup se ghayal kar diya
 The injured youth is admitted to the hospital, where he is undergoing treatment
 aarope he ki bharuch balaach or ajmal mohaniya naam ke ye donon yuvak dahod main chori karne aae the, lekin pakade gaye
 After this, angry people beat both of them like kiburi, due to which one died on the spot, while the other was badly injured
 usko ghayal avasthaa main aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya, jahaan uski haalat gambhir bani hui he
 It is being told that these two youths came out of jail on bail only two days ago
 donon lut or chori karne ke aarope main jail gaye the

 After this, the angry villagers beat both these young men fiercely, in which Ajmal Mohania died on the spot
 jabaki doosraa yuvak bharuch balaach buree tarah jakhmi ho gaya
 He is admitted to the hospital, where his condition remains critical
 vahiin,mob linchingke is maamle main police ne 100 logon ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya he
 Police is currently investigating the case
 beshak in yuvakon par chori karne kaa aarope he, lekin yahaan sawaal yah he ki aakhir bheed ko kanoon apane haath main lene kaa adhikaar kisne diya? khaskar tab jab supreme court ne mob linching kii ghatnaon ke khilaaf faisla sunaaya he
 Recently, the Supreme Court had taken a strong stand on the incidents of lynching and said that as far as law and order is concerned, it is the responsibility of each state to take such measures that there is no violence
 chif justise deepak mishra kii aguwai vaali bench ne saaf kaha tha ki koi bhi shaks kanoon ko kisi bhi tarah se haath main nahin le saktaa
 It is the responsibility of the state government to maintain law and order and every state government must bear these responsibilities

 ' Q
 bajet se yah dharna bani he ki bharat ab kalyankari rajya banane kii disha main bad rahaa he
 It is the duty of every government to work for the welfare of the poor and the underprivileged
 agar hamaari sarkaar ke khilaaf yah aarope lag rahaa he, to hamen isse koi gurej nahin he
 But this government has shown what makes financial sense
 hamane ek najuk arthvyavastha ko duniya kii sabase tej arthvyavastha main badalane main kamyaabi dikhaai he
 We have succeeded in providing basic amenities, which every citizen has the right to - it is not possible that our mothers and sisters cannot get a toilet
 kya is tarah se 21veen sadi main bharat mahashakti ban saktaa he? kya ham lakhon bacchon ko bijli kii pahunch se vanchit rakhkar yah ummid kar sakate hai ki ve duniya se muqabla karen? main samajhataa hum ki kisi bhi sarkaar kaa yah pehla daayitv he ki desh main uplabdh sansadhano kaa istemaal sabase pehle apane sabhi nagarikon ke ek behatar or buniyadi bhavishya ke liye kare
 Especially think of those who have not been able to ride the vehicle of development or are left behind
 unki niyati yah to nahin he ki puri jindagi gurbat main hi guzaar den? ham sabko milakar unhen upar uthaanaa hoga
 So, why didn't you announce gifts for the farmers long ago? Since the first year, this government has taken care of all sections of the society
 khetihar samudaay ke liye, hamane lagaataar aise upaay kiye hai jisase unke kheton kii urvartaa or paidaavaar bade
 Ultimately, giving 170 million soil health cards has helped farmers understand what is suitable for them
 sinchai yojanaon ke karodon rupye bhrashtachar ne nigal liye hai or kheton ko vaadon ke mutabik pani bhi nahin mil paaya, jaisaa maharashtra main dekha gaya he
 We are trying to complete many such projects now so that our farmers can get maximum water
 hamane yah aashwast kiya he ki har vyakti ko bijli kaa conection mil sake
 People do not have to depend on diesel generators or other expensive equipment to supply water to their fields
 hamane unhen pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana muhaiyaa karaayaa he
 This is such a National Farmers Insurance Scheme, which compensates for 100 percent loss in the event of natural disaster
 hamane aashwast kiya ki kisaanon ko karj doguna mili, taaki unhen vakt jarurat par paise kii samasya se na jujhna pade
 Yields have increased so much that earlier where we used to import pulses, oilseeds, at the same time the production in our country is excessive and we are exporting agricultural products
 kuch had tak is baari paidaavaar adhishesh kii vajah se keemton main giravat ai he
 Inflation is almost zero and consumers are taking advantage of it
 haalanki kisaan kuch mushkilon kaa saamana kar rahe hai

 ham sirf unke yogadan ko sweekaar kar rahe hai or jo raashi de rahe hai (yojana ke mutabik har saal 6,000 rupye), vah desh ko khaadya ke maamle main surakshit banane main unke kathor shram ke sammaan kaa pratik he
 According to you, what will be the impact of this package which gives relief to the farmers? We have provided funds
 ham congress kii tarah nahin hai, jisane 2008 main karjamaafee kii ghoshnaa to kar di thi, lekin uske liye ek rupye kii bhi vyavastha nahin kii or iskaa boj bhavishya kii sarkaar ke kandhe par daal diya
 This year, we have not only arranged Rs 20,000 crore as the first installment — from December to March — but also provided a full Rs 75,000 crore for the next year
 main yah kehane kaa saahas kar saktaa hum ki iske pehle koi bhi sarkaar apane bajaton ke liye is had tak eemaandaar nahin rahi he, jitna ham hai
 This results in a fiscal deficit of 0
 1 fisad ank kii badhotaree ho sakati he, lekin mujhe lagata he ki isko log acha hi maanenge
 This amount is going into the hands of the rural people and will be spent in the economy and this flow of money will increase the pace of economic growth
 isse jiesti or iskar sangrah main bhi madad milegi, kyonki udyog jagat behatar kaam karegaa or uski kshamtaaon kaa zyada istemaal ho paaegaa
 Jobs will also be created

 isse kul hisaab-kitaab main kitna fark aayaa he?yah sab kuch bilkul saaf-saaf likhaa hua he
 Our fiscal deficit figure 3
 2 fisadi se 3
 Was up to 3 per cent
 aise main, koi bhi yah suzav de saktaa tha ki aap kharchon main 5,000 karod rupye ke aasapaas tak kii katautee karen to yah 3
 It will be 34 percent and after that you get it 3
 3 fisadi dikhaa sakate hai or yah kah sakate hai ki hamane rajkoshiya ghate kaa lakshya puraa kar liya he
 But the Prime Minister told me very clearly
 unhone kaha tha ki vibhinn mantralayon se jo bhi aankade aaen, aapkaa kaam use samgr tareeke se pesh karnaa he
 Whatever figures come, you show
 unhen acha dikhaane ke liye samyojit na karen
 i think that is the strength of Mr
 Modi and Mr
 Arun Jaitley - their emphasis has been on providing honest budget
 aap yah aise samay main kah rahe hai jab desh main aankadon kii vishwasaneeyata, jaise rojgaar ke aankadon ke maamle main, par kaaphi andeh khadey ho gaye hai

 5 per cent, which investors are particularly concerned about
 sarkaar is par aakhir dhyaan kyon nahin detii?kuch chijen intjaar nahin kar saktin
 For example, i have to build houses so that every citizen gets a house
 mujhe apni maataaon-bahanon ko 10 karod shauchalay dene hai, taaki ve garima ke saath jivan bitaa saken

 Did you ever imagine it? Over-production of electricity, coal production has never happened at such a rapid pace before
 desh main pariyojnaon kaa kriyanvayan jis paimaane par ho rahaa he, vaisaa pehle kabhi nahin hua
 But what would you say about employment figures? After all, what is the reason for not releasing the findings of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)? Many things have changed, but the figures are still being collected by traditional methods
 duniya badal rahi he or kaaphi teji se badal rahi he, lekin isamen (data ke sangrahan) kaam kii viksit hoti prakruti kii gati se talmail nahin ban paa rahaa
 The figures of Rs 7 lakh crore distributed to the beneficiaries of the 15 crore Mudra scheme will not be available, unless it is thought of
 isamen hamaare start-ap yaa 5 lakh ola (radio cab) driveron ke aankade nahin aa sakate, jab tak aankadon ko ikattha karne ke tareekon main sanshodhan na kiya jaae or nae pariprekshya ko dhyaan main na rakhaa jaae
 All these matters are under consideration
 kai akhabaaron ne apusht eneseso data ko chhap diya or uske baad ek kahani ban gai
 We believe that data should be more robust and more robust data will help us to do much better work
 to, aapke mutabik rojgaar kaa sankat he yaa nahin?is tarah kaa sankat to hameshaa rahaa he
 Today it is much less
 kuch log jis paimaane kaa sankat bataane kii koshish kar rahe hai, vaaki agar aisa hota to jaisaa shri jetali ne kaha, desh kii sadakon par ashaanti fail jaati
 The way we think about jobs is changing
 hamen desh main kaamkaaj ke multatv ko pakadia hoga
 There are about 60 million retail businesses in the country
 kya naukariyon yaa rojgaar ke aankadon main inako shaamil kiya jaataa he? ji nahin
 Job creation is a continuous process
 20 karod shauchalay hawa main nahin banate, inhen taiyaar karne ke liye logon ko kaam karnaa padataa he
 Electricity does not reach every corner of the country through satellite, it reaches people who work there
 elidi balbon kaa nirmaan bharat main ho rahaa he
 And all this is not happening by any miracle
 iske liye log kaam kar rahe hai
 We are expanding healthcare facilities
 hamen bharosa he ki agle saal ek lakh karod rupye mulya kii chikitsa suvidhaayen taiyaar hongi
 My thinking is that we have created jobs in new fields
 artificial intelegence, aadhunik technology, akshay urja, swasthya, tel evam gas kaa anveshan aise bade kshetra sabit honge, jinamein naukariyaan paidaa ho rahi hai
 While presenting the 10-year vision plan, Nanya thought that the elections are going to be held in the next 10 weeks? Those who are short-sighted, think small
 lekin jinke paas drushti hoti he, ve dur tak sochate hai
 So, why did you not outline what you will do for the next election? i remember that in the first or second cabinet meeting, the Prime Minister clearly said that our job is not to look forward to the next elections
 hamaara kaam yah he ki ham desh kii janata kii bhalaai ke liye kya kar sakate hai or use us vakt karnaa he jab isaki jarurat ho
 Set your priorities
 vah kaam sabase pehle karen jo sabase zyada jaruri ho
 Do not wait for elections to come and go
 unka maananaa he ki chunaavon ko dhyaan main rakhkar faisle karne se desh ko bahut nuksaan uthaanaa padaa he
 So, is this not a hasty step taken by a panicked government to preserve power? i don't think we have done anything that indicates panic
 hamaare paas itani takat rahi he ki ham paanch varshon main kai kathor faisle le sake
 Our surveys conducted by several impartial agencies have given a good rating to Prime Minister Modi and described the party's base as very strong
 hamen puri ummid he ki agle loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ko akele 300 se zyada siten milengi or endie ko do-tihaai se zyada kaa bahumat milegaa
 Elections will keep coming
 hamaara kaam deshavaasiyon kii seva karnaa or unhen ek behatar bhavishya dena he
 This has to be done by doing things which earlier governments have not been able to do
 iske alaava ek majboot arthvyavastha khadi kerani he jiskaa laabh kai dashakon tak logon kaa miltaa rahe
 What do you think Rahul Gandhi is promising to implement the minimum income scheme? If you spend 3 lakh crores in your budget spending
 kii rakam jod den, jo is tarah kii yojana ke liye anumaanit raashi he, to mahangaai kii dar phir se do ankon main pahunch jaaegi or rajkoshiya ghaataa aasmaan chune lagegaa

 main congress se poochna chaahunga ki kya urvarak or bijli kii keemten paanch guna badaae vaali hai? kya madhya varg ko bijli ke liye doguna bill chukaana hoga? kya jin logon ko sabsidi vaala anaaj miltaa he, unhen uske liye bazaar ke bhav se keemat deni hogi? garib or madhya varg ko philhal sabsidi kii vajah se sasti rasoi gas milti he, kya unhen har silinder ke liye doguni keemat deni hogi? congress aakhir kya kehane kii koshish kar rahi he? ham bhartiya nagarikon ko aatmanirbhar bananaa chaahate hai, na ki sarkaron par nirbhar
 There was speculation that this time a basic income scheme for all would be announced in the budget
 main kisaanon ko milane vaali sabsidi band nahin kar saktaa hum
