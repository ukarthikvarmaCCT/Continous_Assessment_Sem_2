 Emphasizing the system to speed up the functioning, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday asked the bureaucrats to abolish the old rules and procedures which create confusion and create hindrance in governance
 pradhanmantri ne unhen nirnay lene ke liye utsahit kiya or vaada kiya ki vah unka saath denge
 The Prime Minister held a collective meeting with 77 secretaries and senior officials of all ministries and departments and asked them to contact them directly by phone or e-mail to make suggestions or intervene to resolve any issue
 pichley aath saalon main pehali baar hui aisi baithak ke baad jari aadhikarik bayaan main kaha gaya he ki dhai ghante chali lambii baithak main modi ne sheersh naukarshahon ko dhairyapurvak suna or unki bhaawanaaon se sahanubhuti jataai
 The Prime Minister also noted his displeasure over not assessing his true abilities due to 'circumstances'
 modi ne desh kaa bhavishya behatar banane main naukarshahon kii patibaddhta or kshamta par puraa bharosa jataate hue unase kaha ki prashasnic niyamon evam prakriyaaon ko saral evam durust banaaen, taaki ye janhitaishi ho saken
 He said, there may be rules and procedures which have become outdated and are creating confusion rather than convenience in the process of administration
 unhone aise puraane niyamon evam prakriyaaon kii pahchaan karne evam unhen khatm karne kii aavashyaktaa par jor diya
 Promising all officials to have access to them, the Prime Minister encouraged them to approach them with their information and ideas
 bayaan main kaha gaya he ki unhone adhikariyon ko nirnay karne ke liye protsaahit kiya or aashwaasan diya ki vah unke saath khadey honge
 Emphasizing the use of technology to bring more efficiency and effectiveness in administration, Modi said, in a democracy, resolution of grievances of citizens is very important and information technology can help a lot in this regard
 unhone 'team bhaavana' par jor diya or sachivon se aagrah kiya ki ve apni team kaa netaa bane
 He said, quick results can be achieved only through collective work
 apane kaamon kaa hameshaa lekha-jokha dene kii peshkash karte hue pradhanmantri ne kaha ki shashan kii prakriya main vichaaron ko sansthagat rup main parivartit kiya janaa chahie, kyonki santhaan vyakti se zyada samay tak rahete hai
 Senior bureaucrats supported the sentiment and welcomed similar accountability
 udhar, pipief ke saath yah achchhai he ki yahaan epady se zyada byaaj miltaa he
 Money is safe, but you cannot withdraw it on time according to your needs
 jarurat par bhi paisa nikaalane kii prakriya jatil hi he
 One will have to face a bit of trouble when the money is deposited in government banks and government offices
 lekin yahaan aisa phayda he ki paisa puraa or samay par byaaj sahit khate main dikhataa rahata he
 And when the time period is over, you can take it into account and use it
 ab yah saaf he ki paisa lagaakar aap yadi kuch saalon ke liye bhul sakate hai tab pipief se behatar kuch nahin or agar aap is paise kaa istemaal kabhi jarurat par karnaa chaahate hai tab epady se behatar kuch nahin
 Now it is clear that if you can forget for a few years by applying money, then there is nothing better than PPF and if you want to use this money at any time you need nothing better than FD

" bharat sarkaar 31 agast tak desh ke itihaas main pehali baar kaarobaar kii drushti se achche maahaul vaale rajyon kii suchi jari karne ja rahi he
 a senior commerce ministry official told NDTV that the initiative is being done under the 'make in India' program and the list is currently being finalized
 vaanijya mantralay ke ek varisht adhikari ke mutabik rajyon kii ranking ke liye aath maapdand tay kiye gaye hai, jinamein sabase upar he 'kaarobaar shuru karnaa', phir number aata he 'zamin kaa aavanton or nirmaan kii anumati' kaa
 The third criterion relates to the 'approval of the environment', and the fourth is 'rules and regulations related to workers'
 paanchaven number par 'buniyadi suvidhaayen' hai, or inke alaava maapdandon kii suchi main 'factoriyon kaa muyna', 'kar-sambandhit maamle' or 'sarkari kaayade-kanoonon par amal' bhi shaamil hai
 The Commerce Ministry is hopeful that the arrival of the list will increase the rivalry among the states and will encourage them to set up new businesses
 tippaniyan In fact, this initiative is part of the Government of India's strategy, which plans to make India a manufacturing hub by making a fundamental change in the current environment to set up new businesses across the country, and it is very important that the state also do its work Change the way to do it quickly
 ranneeti rajyon main kaam karne vaale adhikariyon kii soch badalane kii bhi he, jisase ve badlaav kii prakriya main aadchan paidaa na karen
 According to the latest World Bank report, India is currently ranked 142 in the world in terms of 'easy business environment'

 The strategy is also to change the thinking of the officials working in the states, so that they do not create obstacles in the process of change
 world bank kii tazaa report ke mutabik 'aasaan kaarobaari maahaul' ke maamle main bharat philhal duniya main 142wein number par he

 In such a situation, you should also learn the difference and experiment of the two countries

 china ke sarkari media ne aaj yah baat kahi
 An article in the 'global Times' said,' It is regrettable that CPEC is another factor in the india-china relationship, on which there are differences between the two, but due to India's opposition, China has abandoned the idea of CPEC
 Not likely to give

 With China developing close economic ties with both India and China in recent years, it is unlikely that it would be interested in favoring either of the two countries
 tippaniyan Significantly, the article has used the term 'pakistan-occupied Kashmir' (pok) twice, though it is mentioned in one place by referring to Indian media reports

 aise netaaon ko is rup main dekha jane laga ki bas chunaav hone kii der he, jeet intazaar kar rahi he
 There are three main points of right wing emergence in all the articles like anger against Muslims about terrorism, jobs are being consumed by youth from other countries, settlers from outside are taxing
 duusare deshon ke nagarikon ko samasya bataanaa, globalizeshan ko malaria kii tarah pesh kiya jane laga jaise duusare desh se machhar aakar unke desh ke logon ko kaat le rahe hai
 Our country, our company, our jobs
 is tip kii raajnneeti ko jeet kaa formula maan liya gaya
 In any country where a leader is seen doing these things, the media starts to see the future Prime Minister or President
 sabko lagata he ki rashtrawaad kii jo bhi baat karegaa, janata bahekaave main aati rahegi
 After the outcome of the referendum against the European Union in Britain and Trump's victory in the election of the US President, it was assumed that the right would remain for ten to twenty years
 tabhi 16 march ko netherland main chunaav ke nattejey aate hai or vahaan is tarah kii baaten karne vaale dakshinpanthi netaa yaa dal haar jate hai
 On 7 May, the results of the French presidential election arrive and they are defeated even after the right-wing upsurge
 mujhe dar he ki raajnneetik charchaakaar ab yah na likhane lage ki duniya main dakshinpanth ab samaapt hone laga he
 Macron is only 39 years old
 nepolian ke baad pehali baar koi itani kam umr kaa noujvaan france kii satta ke shikhar par baithne ja rahaa he
 Macron says about himself that he is neither left nor right
 donon kii khoobiyon kaa mishran hai
 It is dangerous to be such a man, i do not know when to go left, when to become right
 phir bhi maikron ko 66 pratishat vot mili hai
 The right-wing La Pen gets 34 percent of the vote
 france main abhi tak dakshinpanthi takaton ko kabhi itnaa vot nahin mila tha
 Macros are advocates of globalization
 european union main france ke bane rahane kii vakaalat karte hai
 They also do not hate immigrants, like the Trump, saying that young Americans from other countries cannot eat American jobs
 maikron kii patni briggit maikron 64 saal kii he
 When Macron was 15 years old, Brigitte taught him drama
 16 saal kii umr main hi maikron ne shaadi kaa faisla kar liya tha
 In the class that Macron was in, Brigitte's daughter also studied, but Macron fell in love with his teacher
 briggit kii pehali shaadi se teen bachche bhi hai
 Macrons do not hide their love from anyone but present themselves with full confidence in front of the world
 lagata he france main anti romeo dal nahin he
 The story of Macron and Brigitte's love can only be primed separately
 france main berojgaare bahut bada mudda tha
 The unemployment rate is ten percent
 chaar main se ek yuva berojgaar he
 Even after this, there was no issue like the US that people from other countries are going to eat their jobs as it went in America
 raashtrapati trump to imigrent ke khilaaf khub bolte hai
 Recently Infosys also had to say that it would recruit several thousand Americans to its company
 imigrents ke khilaaf itnaa gussa bhadkaa ki iske shikaar bhartiya bhi hue
 Indians were killed in America
 aam taur par mana jaataa he ki berojgaare badhati he to dakshinpanth garam hone lagata he
 Young people like the language of nationalism but it did not happen in France
 vahaan america se zyaada berojgaare he magar vahaan dakshinpanthi netaa laa pen ek nae rajaneta se haar gayi jo pehali baar chunaav hi lard rahaa tha
 After the victory, Macron said he would protect France and Europe
 europe or puri duniya hamen dekh rahi he or intazaar kar rahi he ki ham kai jagahon par khatare main pade vivek kii raksha ke liye aage aaen
 He said, 'I will try my best so that there is no more reason to vote for extremism in front of you
 sab kah rahe the ki meri jeet asambhav he, lekin aise log france ko nahin jaanate the
 ' maikron ko bhale hi 66 pratishat vot mili hai lekin france ke itihaas main 40 saal main sabase kam matdaan hua he
 a third of voters voted neither Macron nor La Pen
 ek karod bees lakh votaron ne vot hi nahin diya
 Nobody knew him in French politics until three years ago
 aakhir france main logon ne dakshinpanth ko kyon nakaar diya, udaaravaadi samaajawaadee oland ko kyon nakaar diya
 Why chose a leader who did not come from the left or from the right
 39 saal kaa noujvaan pehla chunaav ladata he, france kaa raashtrapati ban jaataa he
 The comments march maheene main thik aisa hua jab netherland main 30 saal kaa noujvaan jesi clavar muslim virdohi, duusare deshon se naukari ke liye aae logon ke khilaaf raajnneeti kii aandhi ko roak detaa he
 He wins over environmental issues
 netherland main harth vilder kii jeet maani ja rahi thi jo madrason or masjidon ko band karne kii baat kar rahe the
 The world had an eye on the election of the Netherlands that the Netherlands would also be swayed by the right-wing leader but the people of the Netherlands defeated the radical right-wing party
 netherland main worth vilder to america raashtrapati trump ke photocopy the
 He also started talking about building a wall on the borders of the Netherlands, his inflammatory speech seemed to have left no argument now, the public has gone mad, he has given up thinking, he just likes the religion, anti-muslim Things look good france ke maikron kii tarah green left ke netaa jesiha bhi khulkar kehane lage ki ve khud imigrent kii paidaaish hai
 They will not oppose the immigrant
 unki maa indonesian mul kii hai or pita morocco mul ke hai
 He had four to fourteen mps in this election
 yahi nahin, netherland ke dakshinpanthi netaa netherland ko phir se mahaan banane kii baat karne lage
 Just as Trump had raised the slogan of making America great again
 france main bhi dakshinpanthi netaa laa pen ne france ko phir se mahaan or french banane kaa naaraa diya
 Trump won, but Greatness shop in the Netherlands and France is currently closed
 log samaj gaye ki mulkon ko mahaan banane kaa naaraa bogus hota he or ek netaa apni dukaan chamakaane ke liye iskaa istemaal karata he
 The result of France is telling that a large number of voters had lost all these things, so they did not go to vote and those who went knew that the real issue was unemployment
 dharm or rashtrawaad ke naam par dakshinpanthi netaa naukariyon ke sawaal se batch rahe hai
 There were 11 presidential candidates in France, the only ones being Macron who supported globalization
 hamaara desh, hamaari company, hamaari naukariyaan
 This type of politics was accepted as a winning formula
 jis bhi desh main is tarah kii baaten karne vaala koi netaa dekha jaataa he, media ko usamen bhavi pradhanmantri yaa raashtrapati nazar aane lagata he
 Everyone feels that whosoever will talk about nationalism, the people will continue to be misguided
 britain main european union ke kilaaf janamat sangrah ke nattejey or america raashtrapati ke chunaav main trump kii vijay ke baad to maan liya gaya ki das bees saal tak dakshinpanth rahegaa
 Only then do the results of the election come in the Netherlands on 16 March and the right-wing leaders or parties who talk like this lose
 7 may ko france ke raashtrapati chunaav ke nattejey aate hai or dakshinpanthi ubhaar ke jor pakadaney ke baad bhi unki karaari haar hoti he
 i am afraid that the political debaters should not start writing that right-wing is now ending in the world
 maikron maatr 39 saal ke hai
 For the first time since Napoleon, such a young man is going to sit at the peak of the power of France
 maikron khud ke bare main kehete hai ki ve na left hai na rhite hai
 The merits of both are a mixture
 aisa aadmi hota khataranaak he, pataa nahin kab left ho jaae, kab rhite ho jaae
 Nevertheless, Macros received 66 percent of the vote
 dakshinpanthi laa pen ko 34 pratishat vot mil hai
 In France, right-wing forces had never received so much votes
 macro globalizeshan ke samarthak hai
 The European Union advocates the continuance of France in the Union
 ve imigrent yani pravaasiyon se bhi nafrat nahin karte hai, trump kii tarah nahin kehete ki duusare desh se aane vaale noujvaan america naukariyaan nahin kha sakate
 Macron's wife Brigitte Macron is 64 years old
 maikron jab 15 saal ke the tab briggit unhen drama sikhaaya karti thim
 At the age of 16, Macron had decided to get married
 maikron jis class main the us class main briggit kii beti bhi padhati thi magar maikron ko apni teacher se pyaar ho gaya tha
 Brigitte also has three children from her first marriage
 maikron apane prem ko kisi se chhipate nahin balki duniya ke saamne puure aatmavishvaas ke saath haazir hote hai
 France does not seem to have an anti-romeo squad
 maikron or briggit ke pyaar kii kahani par hi alag se prime time ho saktaa he
 Unemployment was a major issue in France
 berojgaare kii dar das pratishat he
 One in four youth are unemployed
 iske baad bhi america kii tarah mudda nahin chalaa ki duusare desh ke log unki naukariyaan kha ja rahe hai jaise america main chal gaya
 President Trump speaks highly against the immigrant
 haal hi infosis ko bhi kahana padaa ki vah kai hazaar americanyon ko apni company main bhartee karegi
 There was so much anger against immigrants that Indians were also victims of this
 america main bharatiyon kii hatya ho gai
 It is generally believed that if the unemployment increases, the right begins to heat up
 naujavaanon ko rashtrawaad kii bhashaa acchhee lagane lagati he magar france main aisa nahin hua
 There is more unemployment than America, but right-wing leader La Pen lost to a new politician who was contesting elections for the first time
 jeet ke baad maikron ne kaha ki ve france or europe kii raksha karenge
 Europe and the whole world is watching us and waiting for us to come forward to protect the conscience at risk in many places
 unhone kaha, 'main puri koshish karuunga taaki aage se aapke saamne atvaad ke liye vot karne kaa phir koi kaaran baaki naa rahe
 Everyone was saying that my victory is impossible, but such people did not know France
 ' Macron may have received 66 percent of the vote but the lowest turnout in 40 years in the history of France
 ek tihaai matadaataaon ne to na maikron ko vot diya na laa pen ko
 One crore twenty lakh voters did not vote at all
 teen saal pehle tak france kii raajnneeti main unhen koi nahin jaanata tha
 After all, why did the people in France reject the right, and the liberal socialist Hollande
 ek aise netaa ko kyon apana rahanuma chun liya jo na left se aata tha na rhite se
 The 39-year-old fights the first election, becoming the President of France
 tippaniyan This happened exactly in March, when Jesse Klaver, a 30-year-old youngster in the Netherlands, stops the storm of politics against anti-muslim people from other countries for jobs
 wo paryaavaran ke muddon ko lekar jeet jaataa he
 Hearth Wielder was believed to be winning in the Netherlands, who was calling for the closure of madrasas and mosques
 netherland ke chunaav par duniya kii nazar thi ki netherland bhi dakshinpanthi netaa kii baton main bah jayega lekin netherland kii janata ne kattar dakshinpanthi party ko haraa diya
 Worth Wilder was a photocopy of US President Trump in the Netherlands
 ve bhi netherland kii simaaon par diwaar banane kii baat karne lage, unke bhadakaau bhaashan se lagata tha ki ab koi tark nahin bachaa he, janata pagal ho chuki he, usne sochna chhod diya he, use bas dharm kii baaten acchhee lagati hai, musalmaan virdohi baaten acchhee lagati hai
 Like the Macrons of France, Jesseha, the leader of the Green Left, openly said that he himself was an immigrant
 ve imigrent kaa virodh nahin karenge
 His mother is of Indonesian descent and the father is of Moroccan origin
 is chunaav main unke chaar se chaudaa saansad ho gaye
 Not only this, the right leaders of the Netherlands started talking about making the Netherlands great again
 thik jaise trump ne america ko phir se mahaan banane kaa naaraa diya tha
 In France too, right-wing leader La Pen gave the slogan of making France great again and French
 trump to jeet gaye magar netherland or france main mahanata kii dukandaaree philhal band ho gai he
 People understood that the slogan to make the country great is bogus and a leader uses it to make his shop shine
 france kaa nateeja bataa rahaa he ki badi sankhya main matadaata in sab baton se chat gaye the isliye vot hi dene nahin gaye or jo gaye wo jaanate the ki asli masalaa berojgaare he
 Right-wing leaders are avoiding the question of jobs in the name of religion and nationalism
 france main raashtrapati pad ke 11 ummidavaar the, inamen se akele maikron hi the jinhone globaligeshan kaa samarthan kiya
 Macron is only 39 years old
 nepolian ke baad pehali baar koi itani kam umr kaa noujvaan france kii satta ke shikhar par baithne ja rahaa he
 Macron says about himself that he is neither left nor right
 donon kii khoobiyon kaa mishran hai
 It is dangerous to be such a man, i do not know when to go left, when to become right
 phir bhi maikron ko 66 pratishat vot mili hai
 The right-wing La Pen gets 34 percent of the vote
 france main abhi tak dakshinpanthi takaton ko kabhi itnaa vot nahin mila tha

 Macrons do not hide their love from anyone but present themselves with full confidence in front of the world
 lagata he france main anti romeo dal nahin he
 The story of Macron and Brigitte's love can only be primed separately
 france main berojgaare bahut bada mudda tha
 The unemployment rate is ten percent
 chaar main se ek yuva berojgaar he
 Even after this, there was no issue like the US that people from other countries are going to eat their jobs as it went in America
 raashtrapati trump to imigrent ke khilaaf khub bolte hai
 Recently Infosys also had to say that it would recruit several thousand Americans to its company
 imigrents ke khilaaf itnaa gussa bhadkaa ki iske shikaar bhartiya bhi hue
 Indians were killed in America
 aam taur par mana jaataa he ki berojgaare badhati he to dakshinpanth garam hone lagata he
 Young people like the language of nationalism but it did not happen in France
 vahaan america se zyaada berojgaare he magar vahaan dakshinpanthi netaa laa pen ek nae rajaneta se haar gayi jo pehali baar chunaav hi lard rahaa tha
 After the victory, Macron said he would protect France and Europe
 europe or puri duniya hamen dekh rahi he or intazaar kar rahi he ki ham kai jagahon par khatare main pade vivek kii raksha ke liye aage aaen
 He said, 'I will try my best so that there is no more reason to vote for extremism in front of you

 ) After the surgical strike, amid the political chaos in the country, Foreign Secretary s Jaishankar gave such a statement, which has started the government's disgrace
 congress ne kaha he ki jaishankar ke bayaan se sargical strike par modi sarkaar kaa jhooth saamne aa gaya he
 Foreign Secretary s Jaishankar has informed the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs that the Indian Army has carried out surgical strikes across the loc earlier
 lekin aisa pehali baar hua he jab sarkaar sena kii is karrwai ko janata ke bich laai he
 Let me tell you that only last week, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar had said that never before in the history of Indian Army did a surgical strike
 2011 main sargical strike kii ghatana ke sawaal par parrikar ne kaha tha ki un ghatnaon ko 'cowart oparation' kaha janaa behatar hoga
 Opposition parties first sought evidence of surgical strikes and then claimed that surgical strikes had already taken place even during the tenure of governments
 uri hamale or uske baad pioke mensargical strikke baad bharat or pakistan ke rishte talkh ho gaye hai
 The Modi government at the Center created an atmosphere for isolating Pakistan
 donon deshon ke bich hone vaale vyapaar par asar padaa he
 It seemed that the Indian government had prepared to break all ties with Pakistan
 uri hamale ke baad bharat main pakistan ke kalakaaron ko bain karne kii maang kii ja rahi he lekin videsh sachiv ne kaha he ki aam logon ke bich hone vaala sampark pehle kii tarah hi jari rahegaa, is par kisi tarah kii rokatoke nahin hogi
 After the Uri attack, not only some parties but many mps of the ruling BJP at the Center including Manoj Tiwari also demanded that Pakistani artists be banned in India
 aise main jaishankar kaa bayaan pakistan ke khilaaf desh main ban rahe maahaul ke khilaaf dikh rahaa he
 Because the Indian Motion Pictures Producers Association has banned Pakistani artists in protest against the martyrdom of Indian soldiers in the Uri attack
 vahiin 'cinema oners agsibitors association of india' ne bhi maharashtra, gujarat, karnataka or goa main pakistani actors kii filmon kii screening na karne kaa faisla liya he
 MNS even threatened to stop screening of films featuring Pakistani actors
 congress ne kiya palatvarmaujuuda videsh sachiv ke bayaan ke baad congress ke pravaktaarandeep surajevalane modi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 "it should be expected that s Jaishankar will not be swayed like his predecessor Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh for 'speaking the truth' and exposing the bjp's fraud," he said
 unhone kaha ki modi sarkaar kii vakpatutaa, ding or shaury ko videsh sachiv ne benakaab kar diya he
 The lies of Amit Shah and Parrikar have been exposed

 Film: Hyderabadi: Tabu, Shahid Kapoor, KK Menon, Shraddha Kapoor Director: Vishal Bhardwajrating: 2
 5 starvishaal bharadwaj kii film 'haidar' wiliam shakespeare ke naatak hamelet kaa roopantaran he
 The film's story revolves around a Kashmiri student whose doctor father suddenly goes missing
 vahaan adhikari logon ko ugravadiyon kii jaankaree nikalwane ke liye shaq ke binah par le jate hai
 The story revolves around searching for a son's father or avenge his death
 'hamelet' kii kahani ko lenaa or use 1995 ke kashmir ke aadhaar par filmana vishaal bharadwaj kaa ek jabardast idia he
 There is violence, there is extremism, people can disappear like that suddenly, life here is useless
 yuddh ke maahaul main ek samvedansheel bachche kaa maansik santulan itnaa bighad jaataa he ki use ajeebogareeb abhas hone lagate hai, use apane pita kaa bhoot najar aane lagata he, vah vaastaviktaa se dur hatataa chalaa jaataa he
 Vishal's film making on this is definitely a great idea
 'haidar' na to hamelet ke bare main or na hi kashmir ke bare main, ye kahana mushkil he ki ye kya he
 The film begins with scenes from wintry Kashmir, scenes i have never seen before
 maine vishaal bharadwaj kii omkara, makabool or kamine kai baar dekhi he, lekin film ke bich 10-15 minute meri ruchi isse hat rahi thi
 Then i told myself that this is a version of Hamlet and many people who came to see the film do not even know about this drama, just go and watch the film as it is going on
 jab main ek imotional film dekhne jaati hum to mujhe rone main koi parhez nahin hota he
 Though there were many crying scenes in this film too, but my eyes were not moist, the film's actors shed lots of tears and left nothing for the audience
 film main tabboo ko chhod sabakaa abhinay aatma ko chune vaala he
 Shahid Kapoor has gone to full depth to judge with Haider's character
 film main unki adbhut pratibha kaa puraa pradarshan hua he
 Shahid has proved that he is the son of the best actor Pankaj Kapoor
 film main shahid kii chuppi, unka gussa, unka paagalpan sab aapako gaharaai se chhuega
 Shraddha's character as Arshiya is very strong
 unhone kirdaar ko khub jiyaa
 At the same time, kk's character as a conspirator's brother was very important for a part of the story
 film main jab ek yaa do kirdaar thos kashmiri bhashaa main baat karte hai to majaa aa jaataa he, lekin sabhi kalakaaron ko ye karne ke liye kyon nahin kaha gaya, isamen koi andeh nahin he ki sabhi kalakaar ye karne main sakasham hai
 Vishal had plenty of spice for this film, but the tangled and dizzy screenplay made the film weak
 vishaal ne hameshaa aisi filmein banaai hai, jisase darshak judate hai, lekin 'haidar main unhone darshakon ko bevakoof samajha
 Flashbacks, after a short story, explain each little thing in detail
 mujhe lagata he vishaal ko kuch bharosa darshakon par dikhaanaa chahie the, log bevakoof nahin he, sabko samaj aata he
 The film has not only lost a good chance, but a weak screenplay has also led to waste of heart touching acting, perfect costume and production design

 reality sho ‘big bos’ main dhamal kar chuki pakistani abhinetri vinaa malik ab sho ke final main hit item sang ‘shila kii javaani’ par apana jalawaa bikherengi
 From intellectuals to common people, Veena may have liked or cursed, but one thing is sure that no one could ignore her
 vinaa ke najdiki sutron ne ‘da express tribune’ akhbaar ko bataaya, vinaa is gane par parfarm karne ke liye sabase behatar pratibhaagi thi
 Therefore he was selected
 vinaa or unke manager sohail raashid ne is bare main kuch nahin kaha he
 Rashid says, 'veena was very famous in the show
 unhen ghar se baahar nikaalane ke liye saat baar namit kiya gaya magar bhartiya darshakon ke vot ne use chah baar bachaa liya
 This means that Veena has fans in India too
 ’ If we can see beyond the stubbornness of politics, then it will be possible that after ten to twelve months a terrible debt crisis will be waiting for us
 bharat ke vittiya tantra ke liye ab upie or endie main koi bada fark nahin bachaa he
 After 2008, just as the UPA asked banks to distribute indiscriminate loans and ammunition of the outstanding loans in the entire banking was lost, just as the efforts to accelerate economic growth are collapsing, the Modi government has started feeling that by giving loans against the electorate Possibilities can be brightened
 sarkaar or rigerv bank ke bich taaja vivaad ke saath hi karj ke is time bam kii tik-tik bhi shuru ho gai he
 India's pseudo-banking, or nbfcs (non-banking financial companies), have disbursed loans in the last four years
 sarkaar, rigerv bank ke jariye karj ke bakaayon ko bainkon ke gale baandhne ja rahi he
 Banks already have huge ammo of outstanding debt on which the new RDX is about to be laid
 rigerv bank governor rahen yaa jaaen lekin ab sarkaar ne yah farmaan suna hi diya he ki ek-sarkari bainkon ko enbiensi ke bakaayaa karj kharidne honge yaa nae karj dene honge
 There will be no strictness on the recovery of outstanding loans on two-banks and on the lines of three-upa, banks will have to start a campaign to distribute loans
 sab jaanate hue sarkaar karj se laden bainkon ko nae barood par kyon bitha rahi he?sarkaar chunaav ke pehle ek karj sankat ko taalna chaahati he
 nbfcs or shadow banking have taken large (commercial paper and debenture) loans from the market
 inhen jamaa karne-jutaney kii chhot nahin he
 They lend further by taking loans from banks and markets
 enbiensi ke 2
 Loans worth 3 lakh crores are to be repaid by December
 kuch badi dendariyaan agle saal sitambar tak chalengi
 The cash crisis in the market started in October after this payment was called as to why creditors know that there is no capital land under the feet of shadow banking
 sarkaar kii kavayad is time bam kii ghadi ko aage badhaane kii he taaki chunaav achche-bhale guzar jaaen
 The UPA did the same when new loans were given to the companies by paying back their outstanding debts
 sarkaar ke dhamkaane par rigerv bank ne bainkon se kaha he ki ve is shadow banking ga ko or karj den, unke bonds ko guarantee den or yahaan tak ki state bank to enbiensi ke 45,000 karod ru
 Is going to buy the outstanding debt
 mutual fund bhi apni nakadi enbiensi ke bonds main lagaate the
 They know the truth of this shadow banking, so they have sold a lot in the last two months
 yani ab inke bakaayaa karj kii jimmedaari badahaal bainkon par aa gai he jinke paas karodon jamakartaon kii bachat he
 According to the NPA formula of the Reserve Bank, nbfcs ie npas of shadow banking are 5 of their total borrowings
 8 fisadi he jabaki bainkon kaa enpie (kul karj kaa pratishat) 11
 8 percent
 inhen milane vaali taaja raahat ek saal baad badi afat banakar tuutegi or tab musiibat ke nae daant ug chuke honge
 The longest order of government debt liabilities is starting from 2022
 yani sarkaar ko yaa to bainkon se liya karj (tregeri bill ke jariye) chukaana hoga yaa use chukaane ke liye nayaa karj uthaanaa hoga
 Meanwhile, the biggest challenge is that interest rates have started rising, which can invite this crisis ahead of time
 chunaav saamne hai, vittiya sankat sabko dikh rahaa he isliye karj par karj baantne se tatkaal na to maang baxi he or na nivesh
 Only a few big shadow banks (nbfcs) will benefit from this
 jaisaa ki 2010 main microfinance companiyon par sankat ke dauraan anya vittiya companiyon par sankat bana rahegaa
 In the financial system, debt is like a bloodbath, a demon of myths
 vah sirf jagah badalata he, badhata he, marataa kabhi nahin
 The market knows this well

 Putting jewelery together makes them more likely to scratch or turn black
 chaandi or moti ke aabhushan kaale yaa pile pad sakate hai yaa unka rang ud saktaa he
 * By keeping them together, they can get tangled and even break, so use a zip lock bag
 aap inhen fold karke aasaani se almaari main kapadon ke bich rakh sakati hai or haar yaa anguthi aadi ko tuutane se bachaa sakati hai
 * Put silica packet in the jewelery box, this will keep the jewelery safe

 It was not imagined by the British

 Modi said that from 1857 to 1947 freedom movement came at different stages, all the people of the country remember these incidents
 is andolan ne aazaadee kaa rasta taiyaar kiya tha
 The war of 1857 was fought in every corner of the country, after that Mahatma Gandhi's return to India, his march to Dandi, Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Chandrashekhar Azad and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose contributed significantly
 is andolan se logon ko lagane laga tha ki ab nahin to kabhi nahin hoga
 Earlier, it seemed that the movement is being run by only a few people, but in the 1942 movement everyone joined
 is andolan main naaraa tha ki bharat chodo, is dauraan mahatma gandhi kaa 'karenge yaa marenge' kahana badi baat he

 The PM said that when all sections of the society got involved in this movement, it accelerated
 mahatma gandhi ne kaha tha ki is dauraan koi bhi maregaa to uske sharir par karenge yaa marenge kii pattee lagaani chahie
 Modi said that when all the people fought together, we get freedom in the movement from 1942 to 1947
 piem ne kaha ki ramavriksh bennipuri ne ek kitaab likhi he zanjeeren or deevaaren jisamen unhone kaha ki har vyakti netaa ban gaya, desh kaa har chauraahaa karo yaa maro kaa daftar ban gaya
 Mumbai showed the way, all routes of movement were closed
 janata ne karo yaa maro ke gandhi vaadi mantra ko dil main baitha liya tha
 Modi said that with the liberation of India, a big message went in the whole world and freedom movement started in those places too
 piem ne kaha ki hamaare liye sabak he ki jab ham ek hokar aage badhate hai to ham desh ko aage badha sakate hai
 Modi also read the poetry of Sohanlal Dwivedi, he recited lines of the poem 'same side'
 piem ne kaha ki aaj jab ham 2017 main he to hamaare paas gandhi nahin he, us samay jaisaa netritv nahin he
 But 125 crore countrymen have the capability that we can fulfill Gandhi's dreams
 us samay bhi bharat ke liye anukool maahaul tha or aaj bhi desh ke liye anukool maahaul he
 India can once again become an inspiration for the world
 modi ne kaha ki hamaare liye dal se bada desh he, raajnneeti se badi rashtraniti hoti he
 The corruption termites had destroyed the country, we have to change this situation
 hamaare saamne garibi, kuposhan or shiksha kii chunauti he ye sirf sarkaar kii nahin desh kii chunauti hai

 supreme court ne faisla sunaate hue kaha he ki agar koi pati kisi anya mahila ke najadik jaataa he to use apni patni par krurta kaa kasuurvaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 The court says that such a case will not come under the purview of cruelty until the husband is so close to another woman that his wife is forced to commit suicide

 'adaalat ne yah bhi kaha ki agar sabit ho jaae to extra-merital afaire ko gaiyrkanoonee or aniatik qaraar diya ja saktaa he
 But in this case it has not been proved that the husband forced the wife to commit suicide

 Meanwhile, senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi has alleged that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is raising the issue of Farakka Barrage and silt management policy to hide his failures in relief distribution among flood victims
 susheel ne ek press vijyapti jari kar mukhyamantri par bhram paidaa karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki unhone nai dilli main jal sansaadhan mantralay ke varisht adhikariyon se baatcheet ke baad bataaya ki farkka baraj kii vajah se bihar main baadh ai he, iskaa vaigyanik pramaan nahin he
 He alleged that the Chief Minister's statement is also baseless that the Farakka Barrage gates were opened at the request of the Bihar government, in reality, all the barrage gates are always open during the monsoon season

 yah tu lanaa kadavi jarur he, par maujuun haih lalu prasad yadav or nitish kumaar mulaayam singh yadav ko bihar kaa manmohan singh bananaa chaahate the
 That is, without any right and status, they should remain the head of the name
 bihar ke “maha secular gathbandhan” main har kaam janata parivaar ke dikhaawati adhyaksh “netaji” ke naam par ho rahaa tha
 On August 12, when Lalu and Nitish split 100-100 seats in their respective parties Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Janata Dal (united), the remaining 40 seats were given to Congress and a single seat for Mulayam's Samajwadi Party (SP)
 He did not leave, then he had prepared his answer in defense of this, "all the seats belong to Netaji
 ”sapa uttar pradesh main vajandaar party he, par padosi bihar kii chunavi bisaat par vah hameshaa haashie kii khilaadi rahi he
 There is a direct contest in this election between the nitish-lalu-congress alliance, which is believed to be the largest alliance against BJP and its nda-led NDA after Narendra Modi came to power at the Center
 lekin maidan se baahar baithkar match dekhne vaale captain ne 3 sitambar ko achaanak faisla kiya ki unhone bahut bardaasht kar liya or ab ve gathbandhan main nahin rahenge
 This decision left Mulayam more important than his stature in this high-stakes election in Bihar, because the exit of "maulana Mulayam" has weakened the glow of this "maha Secular Alliance"
 8 sitambar ko khud mulaayam ne nitish par hamalaa bol diya, “koun he secular? ve jinhone aath saal tak bijepi ke saath sarkaar chalaai? ve aaj achaanak secular ho gaye?” duusare, jab nattejey aaenge, sapa ko unamem bhale ek bhi seat na mili, par agar vah ek dashak pehle mili apane voton ke aasapaas bhi pahunchati he, to nitish-lalu kaa khel bigaad hi sakati he
 The SP will begin its election campaign in Bihar on 22 September, when Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav will conduct a "meeting ceremony" in Patna
 vaise mulaayam ne gathbandhan ko chhodte vakt bihar kii sabhi siton par chunaav ladgaye kaa elaan kiya tha, par ab chote siyaasi khiladinnon kaa ek gathjod banane kii koshishen ho rahi hai
 The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which was upset after lalu-nitish was offered just 3 seats, has already come with the SP
 sutron ke mutabik, mulaayam katihaar se ensipi ke loksabhaa saansad tarik anwar ko mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par pesh karne kii sambhaavnaaen tatol rahe hai
 If this happens, it may shock nitish-lalu's hopes of putting a large part of the Muslim vote in his bag
