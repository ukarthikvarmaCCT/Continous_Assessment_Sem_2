 Just like that

 Also happened to Malhotra (78)
 jab unhone logon ko mahangaai se trast dekha to aise kaary kaa shriganesh kiya, jo apane aap main anoothaa tha- saste main rashan
 Malhotra, who retired as an executive engineer from the Central Public Works Department, says, "I decided to give ration at cheaper rates in 1971 with the inspiration of Baba Lal Singh
" us samay bharat-pakistan yuddh ke chalate mahangaai aasmaan chhu rahi thi
 Our effort was for the common people
 ''shuru main 10-10 kigra daal-chaaval se shuru hua, saste rashan kaa kaam aaj tanon main pahunch gaya he
 In the Jagatpuri area of the Yamuna crossing of Delhi, Malhotra starts distribution of rations every Saturday at half past five in the morning and continues till eight in the night
 ve sarkaar se koi madad nahin lete hai
 Pulses, rice and other household items are purchased from Naya Bazaar on Wednesday
 brihaspativaar ko ek-ek kilo ke packet banaae jate hai, or shanivaar ko vitaran kar diya jaataa he
 Interestingly, 45 people are associated with him, who help in turn
 vah bhi bina kisi swaarth ke
 After all, how can he run this store after selling rations cheaply, but Malhotra explains, "we have a tradition of charity here
" log aate hai or samarthy ke anusaar daan karte hai or ham usase rashan kharidkar logon ko daan main dete hai
 Many donors also come who get two rupees from their money
 kigra aataa yaa 10 ru
 Rice is given at the rate of kg
 ''yahi nahin, ve store main aane vaale har shaks se daan ke liye kehete hai, phir beshak vah 11 ru
 Or Rs
 1,100
 kaa, yah myne nahin rakhata
 The reason behind this is that by cutting the slip, taking ration at a cheaper rate does not hurt people's self-respect and there is a sense of charity
 khaas yah ki logon dwaara kataai jane vaali chande kii parchi se aane vaale paison ko sabsidi main jod diya jaataa he
 Malhotra explains, the sugar in the market is Rs 36
 kigra he lekin yahaan 20 ru
 It is being sold at kg while arhar dal is priced at Rs 80-90
 prati kigra he lekin yahaan 60 ru
 Is found

 Sugar does not get more than a kilo

 Similarly, Anil Kumar Arora (58), working in MTNL, is seen working with full readiness at the store

 Malhotra has been doing this work for 39 years and now people have started recognizing him by the name of Baba with ration
 ''beshak shanivaar ko puure din seva karne vaale log badalte rahete hai lekin malhotra raat tak vahiin rahete hai or munhajbani hisaab karte jate hai
 His wife also helps in this work very well

 bhartiya puranic kathaon ne ravan kii bahan shurpanakha ko khalanayika bana diya
 
 
 But this novel not only puts the sides of female freedom under her pretext but also examines Maryada Purushottam Ram in a new way

 "with greed, force and skill, i can see well the greed to project yourself superior and great throughout the world, which is rooted in you

 But these statements by Vaishravani aka Shurpanakha are some of the sutras that share the heart of the novel
 bhartiya dharmik itihaas ne purushon kii maryaada badhaane ke liye ram jaise charitron ko gadha or vaishrawani jaise stri charitra ko khalanayika bana diya
 Perhaps the reason for this is that these stories of men's fabrication put all the contracts of morality on the shoulders of women
 shurpanakha kaa prasang isi kii baangi he
 The novel raises the question that a woman who is only affectionate to her love, biting her nose, where is the dignity

 Be it Ram, Indra or Lakshmana
 sirf yahi nahin, shurpanakha ravan jaise daanav charitra ko bhi kathghare main khadaa karti he ki usne kaise kathith taur par apni mukti yaa apane dambh ke liye apni bahan ko hathiyaar banaaya

 bahujan samaaj party kii mukhiya mayawati ne samaajawaadee party ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ke saath saajha conference kar uttar pradesh main gathbandhan kaa elaan kar diya
 With this, Mayawati put forward the formula for 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 iske tahat sapa-basapa 38-38 siton par chunaav ladengi or do siten sahyogi dalon ke liye chodi gai hai
 The remaining two seats i
e
 Amethi and Rae Bareli are such where the SP-BSP alliance has adopted a strategy of not contesting against the Congress
 mayawati ne kaha ki congress is gathbandhan main shaamil nahin hogi
 He said, 'we will not include any such party in the coalition that will harm the party or coalition
 ' haalanki, iske baad unhone congress kii pareshaani par maraham lagane ke liye amethi or raibareli main congress ke khilaaf gathbandhan ke ummidavaar ko na ladane kaa elaan bhi kiya
 Mayawati said, 'amethi and Rae Bareli, both of these Lok Sabha seats we have left for them without any alliance with the Congress party, so that the people of BJP cannot confuse the guardian and their president of the Congress party in both these seats
 
 ' haalanki, samaajawaadee party pehle bhi chunaavon main sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ke khilaaf ummidavaar nahin utaarti thi
 But the BSP candidate used to be in the fray
 vahiin, congress ne kannauj or mainpuri jaisi siton par sapa ke khilaaf apane ummidavaar nahin utaare the
 Actually, Mayawati tried to show by her statement that SP-BSP alliance is not against Congress but against NDA
 yahi kaaran he ki unhone amethi or raibareli kii seat par nahin ladane kaa faisla liya, taaki congress ko vahaan bijepi ke khilaaf chunavi maidan main kisi tarah kii koi dikkat na khadi ho sake
 In such a situation, it is believed that if the SP-BSP alliance fielded candidates in both these seats, then the trouble could have increased for the Congress
 aise main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi amethi main hi ulajhakar rah jate or desh ke baaki rajyon main bijepi ko gherne main samay na de pate
 Let me tell you that a big reason behind leaving both these seats is also being considered that after the Lok Sabha elections, there is a strategy to keep the path of alliance with the Congress open

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has claimed that if his party wins the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and forms the government at the Center, then Universal Basic Income (UBI) scheme will be implemented to give a minimum income to all below the poverty line
 vahiin kendra main maujuuda modi sarkaar bhi lagbhag do saal se desh main garibi rekha ke neeche logon ko raahat pahunchane ke liye universal basic inakam yojana par kaam kar rahi he

 There is no condition for doing any kind of work or eligibility for this income and the ideal situation is that every member of society should have a provision of minimum income for living
 kyon ubiai?ubiai koi nai avadharana nahin he balki beete kuch varshon ke dauraan puri duniya main aay ke punarvitaran ke liye istemaal se surkhiyon main he
 The pilot project is underway in many countries, although it has not yet been implemented in any country

 The ashram employees allegedly tried to bribe police officials

 The bribe was promised so that it could make the documents in police custody disappear somewhere
 lekin jab yah koshish bekaar gai to bataaya jaataa he ki asaram ke sahyogi jaanch main shaamil si

 asaram ke teji se failte aarthik samrajya ke peeche nagpur ke isi 45 varshiya aadmi kaa dimag mana jaataa he
 The man, who spent most of his youth with Asaram, has been missing since November 2013

 He is known for his wonderful memory
 rahamaan jaba kaa maananaa he ki uske paas “un saudon kii vistrut jaankaree he, jo shaayad asaram ko bhi thik se na pataa ho
 Officials say Asaram blindly trusted Vani & so much that close relations between them had led to differences between Narayan Sai and his father several times
 jabt kiye gaye dastavejon se pataa chalata he ki vaani ne achal sampattiyon main nivesh karne main madad kii thi
 His way of working was the same: he would look for joint deals with followers and then loan them to buy a particular property
 iske baad kathith rup se vah jameen ko bechney or pehle se tay keemat laane ke liye ek samay seemaa tay kar detaa tha
 If he could not get that much money due to price fluctuations, he would take only bank interest from the follower
 lekin tay keemat yaa usase zyada keemat par agar vah jameen bik jaati to anuyaayi ko munaafe kaa 50 fisadi hissaa baantnaa hota tha
 Shortly after Narayan Sai's arrest in December 2013, Wani allegedly handed over a handwritten note to Sanghani
 bataaya jaataa he ki us note main usne surat ashram ke manager roopabhai ko nirdesh diya tha ki vah surat police, medical or nyaayik adhikariyon ko ghoose dene ke liye paison kaa intjaam kare
 Police say the money was arranged through Ketan Patel, the owner of Sahaj, a chain of grocery stores in Surat
 police ne jahaan roopabhai or patel ko pakad liya he, vahiin ity va idi adhikari bhi lambey samay se kadigoon ko jodgaye main lage hai
 Asaram will not only have to face the rape charges, but will also have to defend himself from allegations of malpractices in the deals of the financial empire

 Rajat is a 28-year-old management professional in Bangalore
 unki jindagi rangeen romance se bharpoor thi lekin unhen phir bhi 'waisi' ladki nahin mili thi, jisaki unhen talash thi
 So, as soon as he found the right girl for himself, he married the family at will
 lekin jaise hi unhen pataa laga ki ladki kaa comarya akshat he, ve kuch maayoos ho gaye
 For Rajat, it was a cultural bottleneck that has long lasting effects
 khushkismati se ve donon shaadi se pehle nae tareekon se sex karke is pareshaani se baahar bhi aa gaye
 Actually, the idea that virginity is the biggest jewel of a woman is now beginning to lose its tone
 or ab to iskaa swaagat bhi kiya ja rahaa he
 It also shows how the impact of socio-cultural taboos is reflected in the change in women's lives, desires and expectations in urban and urban India
 profeshnal lakshya or saamaajik sakriyata par ladakiyon kaa jor badaae se shaadi kii praathamikta bhi peeche chali gai he
 Census data shows that the number of women living alone in our population is 12 percent of the total population (7
 14 karod) he, jo 20-29 varsh kii 'vivaah yogya' umr ke maamle main bada ijapha he
 We also know that India is also a big market for dating / hook-up app Tinder
 tinder bindaas sex kii siforeeshon kii vajah se shaadi par jor dene vaali saaf-suthri dating ap ke bazaar par baari pad rahi he
 And in the era where girls are ready to cross the border, where Indian women have never set foot before, we should also look at Pornhub's recently released 2015 report
 is report ke mutabik, mahilaon ke porn dekhne ke bhartiya aankade 2014 ke 26 pratishat se badhkar pichley saal 30 pratishat ho gaye
 In short, the impact of ongoing efforts, education, positive government steps, feminist activism over the past several decades is now visible on the ground too
 yahi nahin, khwahishon or ummiido kaa izhaar sirf aarthik or peshewar rup se upar maane jane vaale 'pratishthit' virgon tak hi simit nahin rah gaya he
 Hence, essentially an inward shift in trends is taking shape
 ham ise ek tarah kii andrik pragati kah sakate hai
 The matter is now moving towards the desire to achieve sense of happiness rather than just enjoying life, that is, there is more emphasis on the need to recognize our identity
 soshal media ke vikaas or usamen khud ko abhivyakt karne, khud ko pesh karne or selfi lene kii nai bhashaa ke vikaas ne bhi mahilaon ko apane rup ko nikhaarane or use duniya ko dikhaane kaa mauka muhaiyaa kara diya he
 Nowadays more and more girls of India are getting attracted to TV jobs, and try to show their bodies more and more sexy
 isse pataa chalata he ki madhyavargeey striyon ke liye deh kii saanskrithik asmita badal rahi he
 The idea is now getting loosened that a woman's body is a symbol of pride (though at the same time moral watchfulness, caste violence, etc
 is also increasing)
 is badlaav kaa sabase bada pratik sani leyoni jaisi porn kalakaar kii mukhyadhara ke manoranjan udyog main sweekaaryata he, jisaki das saal pehle tak kalpana karnaa bhi asambhav-sa tha
 With this, we will also be forced to believe that even to the extent of hatred, the tendency to serve women — and now men — as sex objects has decreased
 iskaa doosraa pahalu is sawaal se nikal saktaa he ki kya auraten apni khwahishon ke mutabik porn dekh rahi hai yaa phir usee kaa lutf uthaa rahi hai jo purushon ke nazariye se bana he?to, aakhir vah kya tarika he jisase sex santushti kii asaliyat jaani ja sakati he? khushgavaar yaa unmukt sex jivan kii vyakhya aakhir kya ho sakati he? aksar ham is chalaave main funs jate hai ki parampara to 'damankaaree' rahi he or aadhuniktaa 'ukmukt' karti he
 Some taboos in these beliefs are definitely broken in terms of usability
 inkaa varnan is tarah kiya jane laga haih cajual, experimental or open ikvals ko unmukt mana jaataa he jabaki virgin or mishanri pojishan ko puraatanapanthi mana jaataa he
 There are many truths among them, but the difference in them is also creating new rules
 unmuktata ke kai sanketak hai, jinase aise maahaul ke bare main pataa chalata he
 Threeam means three together
 lift yaa cab main yaa phir donon main sex kaa anubhav
 And another gay sex
 isse aap is nattejey par pahunchate hai ki maahaul unmukt ho gaya he
 This gives an idea of openness and diversity in terms of sex
 lekin ye sex ke upbhog kii misaalen bhi hai
 They do not reveal anyone's personal desires and new experiments, so this creates new rules that people want to accept
 sawaal yah nahin he ki kisi kaa comarya akshat he yaa vah mishanri pojishan pasand karata he, balki yah he ki kya ham ise mouj-masti or sukun ke saath jod sakate hai? kya yah badhyakaari paristhitiyon se alag ho jaataa he yaa phir nahin?yah bhi dilachasp he ki jab ham comarya (yah avadharana is myth par aadhaarit he ki ise purush ko bhednaa chahie jabaki asaliyat main yah stri kii yoni ke mukh par ek jhilli hoti he, agar yah use dhake hoti to mahilaon ko masik dharm nahin ho paata) or uske badalte myanon kii baat karte hai to amuman striyon ke comarya kaa hi zikrakar rahe hote hai
 For some reasons, it is not asked whether perceptions about male virginity have changed
 How do men feel about virginity? How do the pressures of being 'experienced in the matter of sex' affect their mood, relationships and sex satisfaction? In fact, most of the debate on changes in male-female sex relationships is focused on women's sex trends, as if our sex culture
 Problems are limited to them
 isi vajah se sex ke unmukt maahaul main mardaangi ek sthaayee bhav kii tarah sthapit he
 We often swing between cultural ethics — which everyone accepts and openly approve — and personal morality, which we think and do in private
 aaj ham sex main kamyaabi or ek tarah ke upabhoktavaadi kii bhashaa main baat karte hai, jisase yah dharna banati he ki jo sex nahin karte, ve haare hue hai
 This thing is special about men who are stuck between the idea of old-fashioned masculinity and today's sex liberation
 nae multi-media digital project ke liye ek gambhir research main ishk—jis shabd main sex, pyaar or vaasana teenon samaa jate hai—ke maamle main mahilaayein khulkar bolti hai ki unhen sex kii chahat hoti he lekin unhen purushon ke haathon chhale jane kaa ehsaas bhi lagaataar bana rahata he
 Therefore, in the superficial things of equality in the matter of sex, a non-equal sense is constantly hidden
 sex shikshakon, counsalaron or anya logon se baatcheet se pataa chalata he ki log apane saathi kii deh se kis kadar aparichit hote hai
 There is no research data that can be used to find out how many women get complete satisfaction during sex on a regular basis
 duniya bhar main yahi mana jaataa he ki har 3 main se 1 mahila ko hi santushti mil paati he
 According to the 2010-11 National Family Health Survey, 8
 3 karod mahilaayein apaat sthiti main lee jane vaali garbhanirodhak goliyon kaa istemaal karti hai jabaki 1
 60 million men use condoms, that is, a ratio of 5: 1
 sex ke maamle main badlaavon ko jaanane ke liye hamen aupniveshik kaal kii 'damit sex bhavanaaen or paakhand' jaisi avadharanaon ke badale shaayad nae sawaalon par vichaar karnaa hoga, tabhi ham isaki sachaaiyon ko zyada sampoornataa or barabari main jaan paaenge

 This book is about to become the author of Bhishma Sahni, in which the British personality, partition of India, Nehru era and between them gradually took shape, Sahni's author personality has come

 The Lokpal, which demanded Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal, was established as a force and gave rise to a large mass movement, it also served to remove both
 aaj beshak kejariwal kah rahe hon ki lokapal vidheyak par anna hajaare ko congress yaa bijepi ke logon ne bargala diya he, lekin sach to yah he ki is algaav kii shuruyaat unhone hi kii thi
 At the beginning of his movement, Anna had clearly stated that he wants to stay away from politics and his goal is to fight corruption
 lekin kejariwal lakshmana rekha ko laangh gaye or party bana baithe
 This was against the ideology of Anna and at that time the two had differences, the result of which is now visible
 ab anna lokapal vidheyak ko uske vartmaan rup main hi paarit kiye jane ke paksh main hai
 He says that this bill will largely meet the needs of which he spoke
 isse kam se kam ek shuruyaat to hogi
 But Kejriwal is adamant on the old demand and he is saying that he wants nothing less than the Jan Lokpal Bill
 is vidheyak se bhrashtachar kaa khaatmaa nahin hoga or yah bhrashtachariyon ko bachaane kaa ek rasta ban jayega
 He says that this bill is soft and will not benefit from it
 ve sibiai ko bhi aaazaad karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 Not only this, they are also saying that this will give mileage to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and they will take credit for it
 baat saaf he ki ab donon ke raste alag-alag ho chuke hai
 Being the leader of a political party, it is obvious that Kejriwal would not want Anna to favor any other party or politician or do something that would be appreciated by someone other than him
 ab sawaal he ki kejariwal yah kaise tay kar sakate hai ki anna kya pasand karen yaa kya nahin? anna jaanate hai ki bahut sakht lokapal vidheyak vartmaan vyavastha main sambhav nahin he
 Political parties will not be ready for that
 shuruyaat karnaa ek behatar rasta he
 But Kejriwal wants everything to be changed in one stroke
 jo bhi ho, donon ab dur-dur ho chuke hai or ab unke mil-baithkar desh kii samasyaon par baaten karne kii sambhaavna nahin he
 This is sad for the country

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was campaigning for the Maharashtra Assembly elections, has said that he will not speak anything against the Shiv Sena and will pay his respects to Bala Saheb Thackeray
 sangli main ek chunavi sabha ko sambodhit karte hue piem modi ne yah baat kahi
 While addressing various rallies in Maharashtra from Saturday, PM Modi kept silence on Shiv Sena and today he made it clear that he would not speak any words against his former ally
 piem modi ne kaha ki bala sahib thakare kii gaiyrhaaziri main yah pehla chunaav hone ja rahaa he
 i have decided that i will not utter a word against Shiv Sena to express my respect for Bala Saheb
 piem modi ne kaha, main bala sahib kii sankalp shakti kaa hameshaa aadar karata rahaa hum
 People of the newspaper should understand our feelings
 
 
 jo log sab kuch raajnneeti ke taraazoo se taulate hai, unhen samajhnaa chahie ki raajnneeti ke upar bhi shraddha ke kuch tatv hote hai
 On the statement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said in an interaction with NDTV that Modi is also dear to us, we also have respect for him, but it would have been a true tribute to Bala Saheb if he had maintained a 25-year-old alliance
 
 sangli kii raily main piem modi ne ek baar phir congress or ensipi par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 Attacking NCP chief Sharad Pawar in particular, Modi said that Pawar should explain why the sugar mills were closed in the area, while his party was a shareholder of the state and he himself held the post of agriculture minister at the center
 modi ne kaha ki congress or ensipi kaa charitra ek jaisaa hi he
 He said that the BJP government in the state is necessary for the development of Maharashtra and hence the way people gave him full support in the Lok Sabha elections, now give the same support in the assembly elections
 marathi bhashaa main bhaashan shuru karte hue modi ne sharad pavaar par tikhaa hamalaa bolaa or kaha, pavaar ke bayaan ne mujhe bahut aahat kiya he
 You (pawar) do not understand history
 1960 se pehle gujarat maharashtra kaa hi hissaa tha
 We have considered Maharashtra as the elder brother
 unhone kaha, main pavaar se poochna chahta hum ki aap shivaji kii baat karte hai
 The Vajpayee government named the Mumbai airport after Shivaji
 aap mukhyamantri the, lekin is bare main nahin sochaa
 Even the Victoria Terminus was renamed Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus by the Vajpayee government
 modi ne kaha, aapke charitra main shivaji ke gun aane kii koi sambhaavna nahin he
 But if you had implemented Shivaji's water management techniques as Agriculture Minister, the farmers of Maharashtra would not have committed suicide
 piem modi ne kaha, pavaar ko shivaji kii baat karnaa shobhaa nahin detaa
 The statue of Shivaji in Surat is bigger than the statue in your Baramati
 gauratlab he ki pavaar ne haal hi main ek raily main bijepi par hamalaa bolte hue kaha tha ki chhatrapati shivaji maharaj ko 'luteraa' kehane vaale log vot maangane ke liye unke naam kaa sahaara le rahe hai
