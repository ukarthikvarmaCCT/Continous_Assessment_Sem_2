 Dear Dr
 Singh, i have started my indefinite fast at Jantar mantar
 i had invited you also to fast and pray for a corruption free India on 5th April
 Though i did not receive any reply from you, i am hopeful that you must have done that
 i am pained to read and hear about government's reaction to my fast
 i consider it my duty to clarify the points raised on behalf of Congress party and the government by their spokespersons, as they appear in media: 1
 It is being alleged that i am being instigated by some people to sit on this fast
 Dear Manmohan Singh ji, this is an insult to my sense of wisdom and intelligence
 i am not a kid that i could be "instigated" into going on an indefinite fast
 i am a fiercely independent person
 i take advice from many friends and critics, but do what my conscience directs me to do
 It is my experience that when cornered, governments resort to such malicious slandering
 i am pained that the government, rather than addressing the issue of corruption, is trying to allege conspiracies, when there are none
 2
 It is being said that i have shown impatience
 Dear Prime Minister, so far, every government has shown complete insensitivity and lack of political commitment to tackling corruption
 62 years after independence, we still do not have independent and effective anti‐corruption systems
 Very weak versions of Lokpal bill were presented in Parliament eight times in last 42 years
 Even these weak versions were not passed by Parliament
 This means, left to themselves, the politicians and bureaucrats will never pass any law which subjects them to any kind of objective scrutiny
 At a time, when the country has witnessed scams of unprecedented scale, the impatience of the entire country is justified
 And we call upon you, not to look for precedents, but show courage to take unprecedented steps
 3
 It is being said that i have shown impatience when the government has "initiated" the process
 i would urge you to tell me - exactly what processes are underway?a
 You say that your group of Ministers are drafting the anti ‐ corruption law
 Many of the members of this Group of Ministers have such a shady past that if effective anticorruption systems had been in place, some of them would have been behind bars
 Do you want us to have faith in a process in which some of the most corrupt people of this country should draft the anti ‐ corruption law? B
 NAC sub‐committee has discussed Jan Lokpal Bill
 But what does that actually mean? Will the government accept the recommendations of NAC sub ‐ committee? So far, UPA II has shown complete contempt for even the most innocuous issues raised by NAC
 c
 i and many other friends from India Against Corruption movement wrote several letters to you after 1st December
 i also sent you a copy of Jan Lokpal Bill on 1st December
 We did not get any response
 It is only when i wrote to you that i will sit on an indefinite fast, we were promptly invited for discussions on 7th March
 i wonder whether the government responds only to threats of indefinite fast
 Before that, representatives of India Against Corruption had been meeting various Ministers seeking their support for the Jan Lokpal Bill
 They met Mr Moily also and personally handed over copy of Jan Lokpal to him
 a few hours before our meeting with you, we received a phone call from Mr Moily's office that the copy of Jan Lokpal Bill had been misplaced by his office and they wanted another copy
 This is the seriousness with which the government has dealt with Jan Lokpal Bill
 d
 Dear Dr Manmohan Singh ji, if you were in my place, would you have any faith in the aforesaid processes? Kindly let me know if there are any other processes underway
 If you still feel that i am impatient, i am happy that i am because the whole nation is feeling impatient at the lack of credible efforts from your government against corruption
 4
 What are we asking for? We are not saying that you should accept the Bill drafted by us
 But kindly create a credible platform for discussions - a joint committee with at least half members from civil society suggested by us
 Your spokespersons are misleading the nation when they say that there is no precedent for setting up a joint committee
 At least seven laws in Maharashtra were drafted by similar joint committees and presented in Maharashtra Assembly
 Maharashtra RTI Act, one of the best laws of those times, was drafted by a joint committee
 Even at the center, when 25,000 tribals came to Delhi two years ago, your government set up a joint committee on land issues within 48 hours
 You yourself are the Chairperson of that committee
 This means that the government is willing to set up joint committees on all other issues, but not on corruption
 Why?5
 It is being said that the government wants to talk to us and we are not talking to them
 This is utterly false
 Tell me a single meeting when you called us and we did not come
 We strongly believe in dialogue and engagement
 Kindly do not mislead the country by saying that we are shunning dialogue
 We request you to take some credible steps at stemming corruption
 Kindly stop finding faults and suspecting conspiracies in our movement
 There are none
 Even if there were, it does not absolve you of your responsibilities to stop corruption

 agarwal kaa kahana he ki junk food khaane se adhik vasa ekatra hone kii pravriti hoti he, jisase insulin pratirodh ho saktaa he
 One of the main reasons for this is the lifestyle of the people today
 daudte-bhaagate or tej-raftaar jivan ke kaaran aksar log subah naashtaa nahin kar pate or din ke baaki samay aswasthkar or fatafat vaala bhojan khate hai
 He said that fast food (fruits, milk, yogurt, salads, dry fruits, sattu, lemonade, sugarcane juice or honey) should be replaced with junk food (refined carbs with trans fats) during work
 logon ko cafeteria yaa workaplace main fal or subjiyan stock karnaa, mithai kii jagah fal par adhik jor dena chahie
 Dr

 The taste buds are only on the tip and sides of the tongue
 yadi aap jaldi-jaldi bhojan karte hai, to mastishk ko sanket nahin milenge
 Eating small gras and chewing them properly gives the brain a hint through taste buds
 mastishk ko keval tabhi sanket miltaa he, jab pet 100 pratishat bharaa hota he
 Thus, how much one can eat depends on the fullness of the stomach

 sujhaavon par centre kar rahi vichaarsarkaar ke pratinidhi adishnal solicetre general atmaram nadkarni ne kaha ki daagi netaaon par 6 saal kaa bain thik he
 This punishment is sufficient for the guilty leader
 sajaa dene kaa uddeshy isse puraa hota he
 However, he also said that the Central Government is considering the suggestions of the Election Commission and Law Commission
 netaaon ko kam sajaa kyon?is maamle main kai yachika daali gai he, jisamen mukhya yachika bhaajapa netaa ashvini upaadhyaay kii he
 Senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, appearing for the case, said that there is life in such cases in the executive and judiciary
 aise main netaaon par sirf 6 saal kapratibandhpuri tarah se manamaani or asangat he
 The Fast Track Court's lobbying court spoke of the fast track court in view of the seriousness of the tainted leaders' case
 court ne isamen lagane vaale vakt or paise samet kai jaankariyaan maangi he
 The Center also supported the Special Court to hear criminal cases against the leaders
 court kaa sarkaar se sidhaa sawaal tha ki janpratinidhiyon ke khilaaf daakhil hone vaale mukademon ko jald nipataane kaa aapke paas kya plan he
 On this, the government said that it is taking measures to reduce criminalization in politics
 sarkaar ke is jawaab se court shaayad bahut santusht nahin tha
 Therefore, Justice Chellameshwar said that the cases of tainted leaders ie public representatives should be conducted in the fast track court as compared to the normal court so that the burden of litigation on the general court is reduced
 saath hi inke bhrashtachar or bhrasht aacharan ke maamalon kaa nipataara bhi jaldi ho jaae
 Handing over the draft plan court to the court in 6 weeks, the Supreme Court asked the government to submit its draft plan to the court in six weeks, which also keeps the information about the number and time of the fast track court, so that the settlement of the lawsuit against any tainted public representative will be settled throughout the year
 Be within court ne sarkaar se ye bhi poocha ki pichley teen saalon main kitne janpratinidhiyon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke mukademe darj hue hai
 Not only this, how many were convicted and acquitted
 bari hue to iske peeche kaaran kya tha
 The government could only tell that in 2014, corruption cases were registered against 1581 mps and mlas
 lekin court ne kaha ki jo sawaal puche gayi hai unke tafsil jawaab sarkaar chah hafte main daakhil kare

 One year of Yogi government of BJP in Uttar Pradesh has been completed
 kai dashakon ke baad rajya main yah mauka aayaa he jab kendra main bhi vahi party satta main kaayam he, lihaaja yogi sarkaar se janata kii ummiden bhi saatven aasmaan par he
 Expectations from the Yogi government also become important because Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself has come from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh and BJP has 70 seats in the state's 80 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 aise main jaahir he ki yogi sarkaar ke pehle saal ke kaamkaaj kaa aankalan bina rajya ke kendriya mantriyon kii report card ko puraa nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The Union Cabinet consists of four leaders from Uttar Pradesh, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh, kendriya mahila or bal kalyaan mantri menka gandhi or kendriya alpsankhyak kaary mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi
 However, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi is currently in the Rajya Sabha from Jharkhand
 lekin unhen kendriya cabinet main jagah dene ke peeche desh uttar pradesh main sarvaadhik alpsankhyakon kaa hona or unka pradesh kaa mul nivasee hona ahm tha
 Apart from this, Mukhtar has contested both Lok Sabha and Assembly elections from the state and has also managed to reach the Lok Sabha once
 grih mantralay banaam uttar pradeshkendra main rajnath singh grih mantri he or uttar pradesh main grih mantralay khud yogi adityanath dekhte hai
 In order to curb the growing crime in the National Capital Region (NCR) for several decades, the entire NCR region was given an integrated police exercise
 lekin purv kii kavayadon ke saamne rajdhani dilli se sate rajya uttar pradesh or haryana main kendra se itar partiyon kii sarkaar sabase bada roda rahaa
 But for the last one year, the Center, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana have ruled the BJP
 iske baavjood kendriya grih mantralay ne ensiaar kshetra ko surakshit karne ke liye is vikalp par kaam nahin kiya
 Significantly, the NCR region is at the top in the crime graph of the country and it has been a big challenge for the Uttar Pradesh Police to make adequate police arrangements in its districts adjoining Delhi
 ise padhein: mantriyon se puche gaye in 10 sawaalon ke jawaab main chupa he yogi sarkaar kaa report cardmahila kalyaan banaam uttar pradeshuttar pradesh main yogi sarkaar ne kaman sanbhaalane ke saath hi purv kii rajya sarkaar dwaara chalaai ja rahi mahila or bal kalyaan kii yojanaon ko band karne kaa faisla liya
 These include pension scheme for women, laptop and bicycle distribution programs for girls
 rajya sarkaar ne yah faisla is sachai ke baavjood liya ki purv kii sarkaar kii yojana puri tarah se kendra sarkaar kii 'beti bachaao beti padhaao' yojana main madad kar rahi thi
 However, even if the state government scrapped the earlier schemes, neither the state government gave any option in its place nor any alternative was drafted by the Union Ministry
 haalanki rajya sarkaar ne ek saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan rajya ke 8 jilon main kendra sarkaar kii kaushal vikaas yojana ke tahat kaushal vikaas kendra ke nirmaan ko manjuuri di he
 Under this scheme, women in these 8 districts are to be proficient in mobile repairing, sewing machine operation, front office management, retail sales

 In order to give effect to this policy of the central government in Uttar Pradesh, the state government has also made it clear that till now it will completely stop the appeasement being done in the name of making minorities merely political vote banks
 kendriya alpsankhyak kaary mantri ne daawa kiya ki purv kii sapa sarkaar ke kaarykaal main muslim apradheekaran ko badhaava dete hue tushtikaran kiya gaya
 The incidents of land grab in the name of the cemetery increased criminalization and religious harmony was disturbed in the state
 lihaaja, sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas niti par chalate hue rajya main muslimon ke tushtikaran ke bajaae unki aarthik or saamaajik sthiti ko majboot karne kaa prayaas kiya jayega, jisase vah vikaas kii mukhyadhara main shariq ho sake

 wo shikha ko lekar kokilaben aspataal pahunchi, lekin tab tak bahut der ho chuki thi
 'frustration is too much in the industry', said the police officer who was investigating the case, 'at night the neighbors informed the police team after which we sent the body to Cooper Hospital for postmortem
 praathmik jaanch se hamen pataa chalaa he ki vah depressant main thim
 'he said,' We have registered a case of Accidental Deathka at the moment
 postmortem report ke baad tasviir saaf hogi ki yah hatya he yaa aatmahatya
 'shikha came to Mumbai only three months ago

 There was a moment in the ICC Cricket World Cup match played between India and Bangladesh which left a question in everyone's mind
 is match main bangladesh kii pari ke dauraan mahendra singh dhoni kuch samay ke liye maidan se baahar chale gaye the or rishabh pant ne wicketcaping kaa jimmaa sambhala tha
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni walked out of the ground in the 12th over of Bangladesh's innings and Rishabh Pant was wicket-keeping
 dhoni ke maidan se yun achaanak baahar chale jane ke baad soshal media par maano tufaan aa gaya tha

 # indvban # CWC19 # thisisnewdelhi # delhicapitals— Delhi Capitals (@delhicapitals) July 2, 2019 Then after Dhoni returned to the ground in the 14th over, the fans breathed a sigh of relief
 haalanki dhoni ko lekar har kisi ke man main ab bhi yah sawaal he ki kya maahi puri tarah feet hai
 Explain that Dhoni's thumb was injured in the match played against England on Sunday
 dhoni konguthe se khun nikal rahaa tha
 The picture of Dhoni sucking and spitting blood from his thumb was also becoming quite viral
 sambhav he ki dhoni apni isi chot kii vajah se maidan se baahar gaye honge
 But if Dhoni's injury becomes serious, then India's difficulties may increase even more

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has issued a whip to its mps about this
 rajyasabha main teen talaak bill ko paas karaane ke liye modi sarkaar gaiyr endie, gaiyr-upie partiyon par nirbhar rahegi
 Many times BJP has faced difficulties due to lack of majority in Rajya Sabha
 jo bill loksabhaa se aasaani se paas ho ja rahe hai, wo rajyasabha main atak ja rahe hai
 In such a situation, it is important to know how powerful the BJP is in the Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha main endie ke paas bahumat nahin he
 Former Union Minister and Rajya Sabha MP Arun Jaitley will not vote
 aise main akele bijepi ke paas mahaj 77 siten hai
 The NDA is limited to 103 in the Rajya Sabha

 The YSR Congress party may not be an ally but will not vote on triple talaq

 The Biju Janata Dal (BJD) will vote in favor of the government on the issue of triple talaq
 rajyasabha main philhal is bill ko paas karaane ke liye 121 voton kii jarurat he
 The YSRCP is believed to have two mps in the Rajya Sabha, 6 JDU mps and 13 AIADMK mps in the Rajya Sabha for voting on three divorces

 aise main teen talaak bill kii raah aasaan bilkul bhi nahin he
 The point to note is that if the parties are absent from voting then it reduces the number of Rajya Sabha

 In Pulwama, Jammu, 37 soldiers were killed in a major terrorist attack on a convoy of security forces on Thursday
 pakistani aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ne is hamale kii jimmedaari lee he
 As such, the name of jaish-e-mohammed has been included in the list of terrorist organizations of the UN Security Council since 2002
 lekin jaish ke sargana moulana masood ajahar kaa naam sanyukt raashtra kii vaishvik aatankwaadi suchi main nahi he
 This is because China, which has the power of veto in the Security Council, is constantly stuck in the path of India's efforts
 pulavama hamale ke baad videsh mantralay ne apane bayaan main kaha ki bharat apane bahadur javaanon par hue is kyrana aatanki hamale kii kade shabdon main ninda karata he
 This abhorrent act was carried out by the jaish-e-mohammed, a Pakistan-backed terrorist organization, which has been included in the list of terrorist organizations by the United Nations and other countries
 is aatanki gut kaa sargana antarrashtriya antkavaadi masood ajahar he jise pakistan sarkaar kii taraf se sanchaalan or vistaar kar bharat or anya jagahon par hamale kii khuli chhot mili hui he
 The Foreign Ministry, in its statement, has once again appealed to the international community, India's proposal to include the list of terrorists, including Jaish leader Masood Azhar, in the UN Security Council's global list and ban terrorist organizations operating from Pakistan's soil
 Please support 
 Earlier in December 2016, the Modi government attempted to include jaish-e-mohammed leader Maulana Masood Azhar and other terrorists in the UN Security Council's Global Terrorist List
 lekin us vakt china main bharat ke prayaason par yah kahkar pani pher diya wo is prastaav ke khilaaf vito karegaa
 China had argued about the decision that there was no consensus among the countries directly involved with India and Pakistan on this issue, as well as members of the Security Council
 haalanki is mudde par bharat ko suraksha parishad ke sthai sadsy america, britain or france kaa samarthan hasil he
 But under the Security Council rules, approval of all permanent members is necessary
 isse pehle china hijb-ul-mujahiddeen ke chif saiyad salahuddin, lashkar ke aatanki abdul rahamaan makki or ajam cheema ko sanyukt raashtra dwaara vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit karne ke bharat ke prastaav par roda atka chukaa he
 Along with this, despite the United Nations ban, China has also remained the same on the question of funds received in Pakistan by Hafiz Saeed and Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi
 lekin moulana masood ajahar kaa maamla zyada gambhir isliye bhi ho jaataa he
 Because he has been openly admitting to meeting Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, and has been saying that he went to cooperate in the recruitment of al Qaeda in Somalia
 iske alaava masood ajahar ne taliban ke mukhiya mullah umr ke prati bhi apni wafaadi jaahir kar chukaa he
 This is the reason that in 1999, Taliban terrorists carried out a big incident like Kandhar aircraft hijack to free him from India's hold
 in ghatnaon se jaahir he masood ajahar kii harakatein sirf bharat tak hi simit nahi hai balki use duniya bhar main aatank failaane vaale aakaaon kaa sangrakshan bhi praapt he
 China is considered an evergreen ally of Pakistan
 iskaa kaaran dakshin-purv asia main bharat kii badhati takat ko mana ja saktaa he
 But China has also been openly saying that it stands with all countries in the fight against global terrorism
 lekin bharat ko baar-baar ghayal karne vaale masood ajahar, saiyad salahuddin, jackieur rahamaan lakhvi or hafiz said jaise aatankiyon par uski daleel thothi lagati he
 When China says on India's proposal that whether these people are terrorists or not, there should be concrete facts and evidence
 agar thos saboot hue to pakistan bhi ise jhuthla nahin saktaa
 But despite sufficient evidence to declare Masood Azhar a global terrorist, China's stance has always been an obstacle in India's path

 pakistan ke baluchistan praant main sakriy baluchistan libration army (ble) ko america ne aatanki sanghathan ghoshit kiya
 The BLA is the same organization that breaks away from Pakistan and demands a separate Balochistan nation
 america ke is kadam kaa pakistan ne swaagat kiya he or kaha he ki america kii is karrwai se pakistan main shanti kaa maahaul penpega
 In Pakistan, the BLA has been banned since 2006 and has been accused of several terrorist attacks in recent years
 america kii is karrwai ke baad ummid jataai ja rahi he ki pakistan main aatanki vaardaaton main kami aegi
 After the ban by the US, people associated with this organization, its conspirators, fund-raising and organizers of its programs will also be considered criminals and will be prosecuted
 ble par pakistan main kai aatanki hamale karne kaa aarope he
 In view of these terrorist incidents, America has taken this big step
 pakistan kaaphi samay scamerica se ble ko aatanki sanghathan ghoshit karne kii maang kar rahaa tha
 On Tuesday, the US Department of Defense said in a statement that the BLA is an armed separatist organization that has targeted security forces and innocent people in the Baloch region of Pakistan
 america ke bayaan ke mutabik ab ble ko samarthan dena ab aparaadh ghoshit ho gaya he or isse judi sampattiyaan bhi jald hi jabt kii jaaengi

 isaki misaal australia main dekhne ko mili, jab bharat se aae ek 62 saal ke dada apni 18 maheene kii potee ko bachaane ke liye train ke saamne kud pade
 The Daily Telegraph reported that a few days ago, Dada, who arrived in Australia, suddenly jumped in front of a train at a railway station in Sydney when his granddaughter's pram accidentally hit the railway track
 dada ne trek par kudakar badi hi furti se pram ko uthaaya or plateform par khadi apni patni or bacchee kii maa ke haath main thama diya, lekin khud unhen plateform par chadhane kaa mauka nahin mil paaya
 Seeing the fast train, he started to run further on the track and climbed on the platform as soon as he got a chance
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ye parivaar gurudware darshan ke liye apane ghar se niklaa tha, jab stesan par lage sisitivi camere ne is 'bahaduree' ghatana ko kaid kar liya
 Wentworthville station platforms are sloping towards the tracks due to inclement weather
 tippaniyan Talking to the media, the girl's uncle Parminder Singh said that Dadaji has done a lot of bravery, he jumped without caring for his life to save the girl
 bacchee or uske dada ko halki chot ai thi or kuch ghante baad unhen aspataal se chuttee bhi mil gai
 Sydney Trains director of operations Tony Ed said the station would be repaired soon so that such accidents do not occur again

 The Bharatiya Janata Party has raised objections to this
 gujarat bijepi ne chunaav ayog main intervyuu prasaarit hone ko aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan bataaya he
 Let me tell you that in the interview given to Gujarati channel of Rahul Gandhi, the Bharatiya Janata Party was fiercely attacked
 intervyuu main rahul ne kaha ki gujarat kaa chunaav ek tarafa hone vaala he
 He said that Congress leaders had forbidden me to do more campaigns in Gujarat but i am interested in work and not in the results
 gitaji main likhaa he- kaam karo fal kii chintaa mat karo
 i obey the same
 rahul ne kaha ki congress party ek puraani vichaardhaara vaali party he, gujarat main bijepi ke paas koi vijan nahin he
 Modi has not kept any vision before the people of Gujarat
 modi yaa to apni baat karte rahe yaa phir congress ke bare main bolte rahe lekin gujarat ke liye unhone kuch nahin kaha
 Rahul said is there any prohibition on my going to the temple? Rahul said that the people of BJP raise this issue
 kya meraa janaa manaa he
 BJP will dissuade this
 main kedarnath main mandir gaya
 i do this, the BJP is getting nervous, are afraid

 Escape from speaking on the future

 Fear is now rampaging through Mr Modi's mind
 He can't sleep
 He stole 30,000cr from the IAF and gave it to Anil Ambani
 Sacking the CBI Chief # alokverma twice in a row, clearly shows that he is now a prisoner of his own lies
 Satyamev Jayate
 bhaajapa netaa subramanyam swami ne kaha ki agar verma ko hataane kaa bahumat kaa faisla tha, to yah durbhagyapurna he
 He said, "I don't know why Verma was not asked to answer the charges against him
" kendriya satarkta ayog (sivisi) ko lekar meri raay bahut kharaab he
 "senior advocate Prashant Bhushan spoke of a 'conflict of interest' in the Prime Minister's role as the Prime Minister is part of the three-member committee that has removed Verma from the post

 Breaking! So, a day after he resumed charge as CBI Director, the committee headed by Modi again transfers out Alok Verma post haste, w / o even hearing him, fearing the prospect of his registering an FIR against Modi in the Rafale scam! Such desperation to prevent any investigation Majeed Memon, another senior lawyer and Rajya Sabha member, termed Verma's removal as an "encroachment of power"
 memon ne kaha, "alok verma ke khilaaf chayan samiti kaa faisla puri tarah se 'satta kaa atikaraman' he
 The committee should have listened to him
 maamle main sivisi kii bhoomika bhi andeh ke ghere main he
 "congress leader and senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi said that it is unfortunate that Verma was dropped on the basis of allegations, whereas the CVC has no credibility
 unhone kaha, "pradhanmantri is baat se ashankit hai ki unke khilaaf jaanch hone par kai saboot saamne aaenge" # alokverma 6 of 10 allegations nt made out; the 4relied upon have no findings; mere adjectives like behaviour nt upto mark, suspicion etc; if mere allegations were enuff wld # PM or # Amitshah step down on surmises &allegations
 Remove CBI director wo hearing wo finding wo proof! pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan kii kursi khatre main pad sakati he
 a petition has been filed against him in the Lahore High Court, seeking disqualification of Pakistani PM Imran Khan
 is yachika main imran khan par 'eemaandaar or dharmaparayan' nahin hone ke saath hi saal 2018 ke aam chunaav ke namakan patr main ek beti kaa pita hone kii baat chhipaane kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he
 The Lahore High Court has agreed to hear the case
 pakistani court imran khan ko ayogy qaraar dene kii yachika par somvaar ko sunwaayee karegaa
 The petition argues that Imran Khan has violated Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution of Pakistan
 lihaaja unako ayogy ghoshit kiya jaae
 Articles 62 and 63 of the Pakistani constitution provide a condition for a Member of Parliament to be 'sadiq and Amin' (honest and pious)
 pakistani akhbaar don ke mutabik yachika main ana-louisa (sita) white kii beti tyrine jed khan white ko imran khan kii beti bataaya gaya hai
 Imran Khan, in his nomination papers for the 2018 general election, hid the talk of Tyran Z
 Khan White's alleged father
 sita white ko imran khan kii purv garlfriend bataaya ja rahaa he
 The question has been asked to Imran Khan many times before, but he never gave any answer on this
 iske alaava sita white ne bhi apni beti tyrian jed khan white ko imran khan kaa biological pita bataaya tha
 Sita White is the daughter of the wealthy businessman Lord Gordon White
 haalanki ab vah is duniya main nahin hai
 It is being told that Lord Gordon White had said that if his daughter Sita White married Imran Khan, he would not give her even a penny from her property
 iske baad imran khan or sita white kii shaadi nahin ho pai thi
 The Lahore High Court on Saturday accepted this petition filed against Imran Khan
 ab is maamle main 11 march ko sunwaayee hogi
 Earlier, a petition has been filed regarding Tyrian Jade Khan White to eat Imran
 haalanki court ne unke khilaaf daakhil yachika ko khaarij kar diya tha
 Now a new petition has been filed against Imran Khan at a time when there is tension between India and Pakistan
 aapako bataa den ki 14 farvari ko jammu kashmir ke pulavama main siarpief par aatmghaatee hamalaa hua tha
 Pakistan-based terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed took responsibility for this

 It is said that more than 280 terrorists were killed
 bharat kii is karrwai ke baad pakistan ne bhartiya sainya thikaanon ko nishaanaa banane kii koshish kii thi, jisko bhartiya vayusena ne vifal kar diya tha
 At the same time Pakistan's F-16 fighter aircraft was shot down
 duniya ke saamne sant kaa chola or duniya ke peeche samarpan-saannnidhya kaa ashleel gang
 Asaram and Narayan Sai continued to run those gangs of obscenity by throwing dust in the eyes of people for years, in which many girls who were unaware were ruined
 donon ne apane gang main kaam karne vaale har gurgey ko naa sirf uske hisse kaa kaam baant rakhaa tha, balki kaam se chukne par sajaa or kamyaabi par inaam bhi diya karte
 On stage there used to be a solo performance of hypocrisy
 asaram akele hi gyaan baghaara karte the
 But when this shop of religion and work came out, Baba also removed his beloved Narayan Sai in the business
 bhakton ne apane bhagwaan ke bete main bhi bhagwaan ke darshan kiye or asaram kii sammohini ankhon ne bhakton main bazaar ko pard liya, lekin stage par ta-ta thaiyya karte-karte asaram ne kab narayan sai ko safed chole main sex gang chalaane kii talim de di, baba ko takataki lagaae dekhne vaale bhakton ko pataa hi nahin chalaa
 The father-son black act would never have come to the fore if the sexual abuse case had not been filed against Asaram in Delhi
 ab tafteesh ke dauraan police ko in baap-bete ke bare main jo baaten pataa chal rahi hai, wo rongte khadey karne vaali hai
 Asaram's gang and their works, Shilpi, Prakash, Lakshmi, Bharti, Dhruvben
 vaise to asaram kaa gang kahin zyada hi bada tha, lekin ye wo chand naam he, jinaki karatuut ab police ke saamne shishe kii tarah saaf ho gai he
 The first two names ie Shiva and Shilpi were responsible for bringing the girls to the hut of Asaram's stigma, while Asaram's cook Prakash used to cheat the girls with opium milk and keep watch over the hut during their exploitation
 vahiin ladakiyon ke shoshan ke baad asaram kii patni lakshmi or beti bharti in ladakiyon par munh band karwaati
 And in the same way, if a girl's pregnancy was prevented by Asaram's handiwork, then Asaram's special friend Dhruv Ben used to abort those girls
 narayan sai kaa gang or gang ke logon kaa kammohit bhojawaani, hanuman, monica, dharmesh
 This gang also used to take girls in the name of Satsang to Narayan Sai's hut
 haalanki narayan sai asaram kii tarah kisi ishaare yaa torch se ladki nahin chunata, balki apni pasandida ladki ko wo baar-baar apane satsang main bulaata or phir ekant main satsang kaa nyauta detaa
 If the girl had accepted these invitations and proximity, then Narayan Sai's gang would have started her brainwash
 lekin agar koi ladki is gorakhdhandhe ke khilaaf munh kholane kii baat kahati, to uske saath aisa bhayanak suluk hota ki log sann rah jate
 Now, one by one, the police are adding all the links by catching the gangs of the father son's sex gang, but to get the investigation done, Narayan Sai is now in the grip of the biggest need
 ek maheene baad saamne aayaa laapata parivaraidhar, asaram par yon shoshan kaa mukadmaa darj hua or udhar unke ashram main padhane vaali ek ladki or uskaa puraa parivaar rahasyamayi tareeke se gaayab ho gaya
 And even more relatives kept searching for this family
 shaq asaram par hi tha, lekin ab ek maheene baad yahi parivaar jab achaanak duniya ke saamne aayaa, to baat or bhi chaunkaane vaali nikali
 It was as strange as missing
 ye vaapasi utani dramai he
 The deeper the suspicion, the shallow it is
 shaq tha ki asaram ne hi apane karatuuton par pardaa daalane ke liye meerut ke us parivaar ko kahin gaayab kar diya, jisaki ek beti asaram ke usee chhindwara ashram main padhati thi, jahaan kii ladki ke saath asaram ne jodhpur main yon shoshan kiya tha
 Apparently, there was hope to prove this girl to be an important witness in the sexual abuse case
 or peedit ladki ne apane bayaan main bhi is ladki kaa zikr kiya tha
 However, before the police could find out anything about this girl and her family, the entire family disappeared mysteriously
 asaram kii shaan main padhe kasidrub takreeban mahinebhar baad meerut se gaayab hua ye parivaar mainpuri main pragat ho gaya
 And not only was it revealed, but as soon as this girl's father came in front of everyone, after reading in the grace of Asaram, he threw mud on all the things that were being said that Asaram was the girl and her family for fear of opening the secret Has made him disappear somewhere
 darasal, asaram ke khilaaf yon shoshan kii report darj karwaane vaali ladki ne police ko bataaya tha ki un dinon chhindwara ke ashram main uske saath padhane vaali is ladki ke saath bhi shilpi kaaphi nazdikiyaan badhaane kii koshish kar rahi thim
 Therefore, he may also have several Raja burials of Asaram and Shilpi
 asaram ne lee hogi raahat kii saans!iske baad hi ye parivaar kuch aise laapata hua ki iske pados main rahane vaale rishtedaaron ko bhi unka koi pataa nahin tha
 Now this girl's father told the people in Mainpuri that he was in his village and there was no pressure from Asaram
 haalanki mainpuri main hi asaram ke khilaaf jameen par kabje ke ek maamle kii pairvi kar rahe mainpuri baar association ke adhyaksh ne ise asaram ke paise or dabaav kaa asar qaraar diya
 However, now with the coming of this family, Asaram must have breathed some peace when he spoke in favor of Asaram
 asaram ko supreme court kaa jhatckpane khilaaf chal rahi khabaron ke khilaaf supreme court main fariyaad karne vaale asaram ko khaali haath lautnaa padaa
 The court dismissed his plea for a moratorium on media reporting
 alabatta itnaa jarur kaha ki agar unhen lage ki media jimmedaar reporting nahin kar rahaa he, to wo dobaaraa court ke paas jarur aa sakate hai
 On the second day of interrogation, on the other side, the efforts of the police are continuing to get to the bottom of the allegations against Asaram

 agar aap apane ghar main shivaji kii pratimaa sthapit na karke unke lingavatar ko sthapit kar rahe hai to pehle kuch baton ko jaan lenaa or samaj lenaa jaruri he
 According to Pandit Binod Mishra, there is a rule to install Shivling in the house
 aisi manyata he ki ghar ke bheetar shivlinga kii sthapana nahin kii jaati
 However, if you want to install, then keep these things in mind
 
 
 jarur jaayen mumbai sthit shri siddhivinayak mandir1
 Never install Shivling with Tulsi ji
 tulsi maa ke saath bhagwaan shaligram kii sthapana hi kii jaati he
 Some people make the mistake of establishing a Shivling with Tulsi
 maa kii puja main bhuulakar bhi naa karen ye kaam
 
 
 2
 shivlinga kii sthapana kabhi bhi band jagah par na karen
 For example, if there is a temple inside the room, do not install the Shivling there
 khuli jagah par hi sthapit karen
 3
 shivaji ko saaf-safai behad pasand he
 They believe in meditating peacefully on simplicity
 isliye shivlinga sthapit karne kaa sthaan aisa na ho, jahaan puja na kii ja sake
 If you are not getting the desired job, then do these measures according to the amount 4
 sabase mahatvapurn baat he yah he ki ghar main sthapit shivlinga kii oonchai anguuthe ke upar vaale por ke baraabar hi ho
 Should not be bigger than that
 isse bada shivlinga ghar main tandav machaa saktaa he
 5
 shivlinga kii sthapana akele na karen

 He was questioned that Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-zawahiri has announced a new jihad in Kashmir, Omar said, "I do not see this happening with the intelligence available to me, but there is a need to be more vigilant
" yah puche jane par ki kya vah yah kahana chaah rahe hai ki khatre ko bada-chadhaakar pesh kiya ja rahaa he, to mukhyamantri ne kaha, kuch had tak aisa he
 Along with this, he said that this argument has been used in 2014 so that AFSPA (armed Forces Special Power Act) can remain in its present condition
 'jammu-kashmir par musharraf kaa model sahi'rajya main aatankwaad ko pakistani madad milane ke saboot ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha ki vahaan aatank ke prashikshan shivi he or seemaa ke us paar isse judi tasviren yah dikhaati he
 When questioned about a possible agreement on Jammu and Kashmir negotiations during the reign of Pervez Musharraf, Omar said he lost a great chance from the general
 parantu agar maujuuda navaj sharif sarkaar musharraf ke chaar sutri kaarykram par sahamat ho jaaen to ham samaadhaan ke bahut najadik honge
 He said that Sharif is talking about trade and bilateral relations, but does not say a word about Kashmir
 pakistan kii taraf se aisa koi saboot nahin mila he jisase lage ki vah sthaayee samaadhaan ke liye baatcheet karne ke paksh main he
 Recently when asked a question about Omar's remarks during a funeral, he said, "I do not mean that i advocate a solution outside the Constitution
" main suraksha balon se javabdehi ke liye kah rahaa hum
 Amid the historic decision taken by India over Jammu and Kashmir, External Affairs Minister S
 jaishankar ne chini videsh mantri wang lee ke saath somvaar ko beijing main mulaakaat kii
 Buoyed by India's decision, Pakistan appealed to many countries of the world, including China
 donon videsh mantriyon ke bich is mulaakaat main kashmir kaa masalaa bhi uthaa, lekin videsh mantri es
 Jaishankar gave some argument to China that China could not say anything further
 jab donon kii mulaakaat main jammu-kashmir se dhara 370 hataane or rajya kaa punargathan karne kaa maamla saamne aayaa to videsh mantri es
 Jaishankar said that the decision that India has taken is under its constitution and neither has any effect on Pakistan's border nor China
 china ne bharat ke saamne jammu-kashmir or ladakh ko centre shasit pradesh banane ke faisle par sawaal khadey kiye the or kaha tha ki isse kshetreey akhandta par asar pad saktaa he
 Foreign Minister S
 in a shared press briefing
 jaishankar ne kaha, ‘baatcheet ke dauraan aksai chin kaa masalaa bhi uthaa, china ko chintaa thi ki anuchhed 370 kii vajah se bharat-china kii seemaa par asar pad saktaa he
 However, he made it clear that India's decision would not have any impact on the international border
 isse sirf bharat ke andar hi rajya main asar hoga’
 Significantly, after the decision on Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi also reached China, but China adopted the path of peace on this issue
 china ne apane bayaan main kaha tha ki bharat ke faisle ke bare main unhen pataa he, vah ummid karte hai ki isse kshetra main shanti bani rahegi

 com / vemawm7gao — India in China (@eoibeijing) August 12, 2019 On the other hand, if you talk about Pakistan, then Pakistan is constantly pleading for help in front of the world and spreading false news about India
 pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne bhi ek press conference main is baat kaa zikr kiya tha ki duniya ke saamne kashmir kaa masalaa samajhaana or apane haq main kar lenaa itnaa aasaan nahin he
 It is clear that no country is willing to accept Pakistan and everyone is describing this decision as India's internal issue
 jahaan duniya ke kai desh aabaadi badhane kii samasya se pareshaan hai, vahiin duniya main kuch desh aise bhi hai jahaan jansankhya ghat rahi he
 Serbia is one of these
 is desh kii aabaadi 70 lakh ho gai he
 Therefore, all efforts are being made to increase the population
 haal hi main srbija main aabaadi badhaane ke liye nayaa naaraa shuru kiya gaya he- deree mat karo, bachche paidaa karo! ek doosraa naaraa he- ‘chalo bacchon kii kilkaariyaan sunen
 'on the other hand, the women of the country say that they need better support to increase the population and not just inspirational words
 srbija main bahut log desh chhodkar ja rahe hai or iske saath janm dar bhi teji se gir rahi he
 On an average there are three children in every two families in the country which is the lowest in Europe and this has reduced the population of Serbia to 7 million people
 sanyukt raashtra kaa anumaan he ki 2050 tak srbija kii aabaadi or 15 fisadi tak kam ho sakati he
 By 2030, India will also overtake China in terms of population
 To overcome the tendency to have fewer children, Serbian authorities have made several proposals, including a plan announced in June
 yojana ke anusaar un ilaakon main kam manjilon vaale makaan banenge jahaan bacchon kii dar kam he
 President Alexander Vukic said this was based on a study which showed that couples living in two to four-storey homes had twice the rate of childbearing
 iske alaava mahilaon ko or bachche paidaa karne ke liye prerit karne ke vaaste nae maatrutiv dekhbhaal kanoon paarit kiye gaye hai
 Lack of consumption is also a major reason for the decline in GDP growth of Indian farmers by Rs 45 lakh crore in 17 years
 70% of the households in rural areas still depend on agriculture for livelihood due to complex regulations and restrictive trade policies
 Reduction in income In the context of accelerating economic growth, agriculture is often ignored
 iskaa ek acha udhaaharan sarkaar dwaara haal main kii gai ghoshnaaen hai- corporate tex main katautee, bainkon kaa vilay, bainkon kaa punarpunjikaran, jiesti main katautee, vaahanon kaa depriciation badhanaa aadi
 There is nothing visible in these announcements for farming
 yah kaaphi vidmbana kii baat he, kyonki kheti bharat main ab bhi jeevika kaa sabase bada strot he or khaskar gramin ilaakon main khapat main aane vaali kami kaaphi had tak krishi kii vajah se hi he
 a major reason for the decline in GDP is the decrease in consumption
 zyada nirbhar, kam aaysanyukt raashtra ke khaadya evam krishi sanghathan (FAO) ke anusaar, bharat ke gramin ilaakon ke 70 fisadi parivaar ab bhi ‘jeevika ke liye mukhya rup se krishi kshetra par nirbhar hai
 According to the Economic Survey 2017-18, agriculture accounts for 49 per cent of India's workforce, but only 16 per cent of the total income
 bhartiya rigerv bank (RBI) kii ek report main antarrashtriya shram sanghathan (ILO) ke hawaale se kaha gaya he ki desh ke kul rojgaar main krishi kshetra kaa hissaa vitt varsh 2018 main ghatakar 44 fisadi rah gaya he
 Similarly, the total share of agriculture sector in the national income of the country is 14 in the fiscal year 2019 as per the Reserve Bank's estimates
 4 fisadi hi rah gaya he
 All this means that agriculture is still a source of livelihood for most people
 haalanki rashtriya aay main iskaa hissaa vitt varsh 2005 ke 22
 14 percent in 2019, down from 6 percent
 4 fisadi rah gaya he
 Accordingly, the low growth rate in agriculture is a matter of great concern
 ek tulanaatmak vishleshan se pataa chalata he ki vitt varsh 2006 se 2019 ke bich krishi jivie main saadhaaran ausat growth rate arthvyavastha ke kul jivie kaa aadha hi rahaa he
 In order to increase the income of the farmers, the question arises that after all why does agriculture continue to be a low-income activity? The OECD-ICRIER study of 2018, which reviews agricultural policies in India, gives the right answer: the inability to increase farmers' income
 isamen kaha gaya he ki tamaam tarah kii sabsidi (urvarak, bijli, sinchai aadi par) dene ke baavjood bharat kii jatil bazaar regulation or pratibandhaatmak vyapaar nitiyon kii vajah se krishi kii sakal aay main kami aa rahi he
 It is assessed by the Producer Support Estimate (PSE), an indicator of the monetary value of annual gross transfers by consumers and taxpayers to agricultural producers
 study ke mutabik 2000 se 2016 ke dauraan bharat ke liye PSE sakal krishi praptiyon kaa mines (-)14 fisadi hi tha
 According to ICRIER Professor Ashok Gulati included in this study, this means that Indian farmers get 2 every year
 65 lakh karod rupee kii aay kam hui he (saal 2017-18 kii keemton par) or 17 saal main isse kul milakar kisaanon ko 45 lakh karod rupee kii kam aay hui he
 He described it as' loot of farmers' income '
 iske nihitarth bahut saaf hai
 Restrictive measures should end
 is study main vaise to kai suzav die gaye hai, lekin professor gulati do par jor dete hai: 1
 The Essential Commodities Act (ECA) and the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) should be scrapped, as they are both restrictive and do not yield a better price
 kisaanon ko samoochee laagat uplabdh karaate hue diarect inakam saport diya jaae or keemat niti ravaiye (jaise input sabsidi, byaaj chhot, fasal beemaa aadi) ko khatm kiya jaae
 Low investment is also a reason for the decline in private investment
 neshnal agriculture policy 2000 se shuruyaat se hi yah koshish kii ja rahi he ki nivesh main sudhaar kiya jaae, khaskar nijee nivesh main
 But official figures show that between FY 2012 and 2017, the public investor is almost at a standstill (0 of GDP)
 3 se 0
 4 per cent), while private investment 2
 7 fisadi se girakar 1
 8 per cent, making 3% of the total investment GDP during this period
 1 fisadi se ghatakar 2
 2 percent is left
 saal 2009 se ab tak karj pravaah main giravat ke aankadon se bhi yah baat saaf ho jaati he
 Due to decline in long-term debt, less debt is being available for investment as well
 krishi karj kii samiksha ke liye gathit rigerv bank kii aantarik kaarysmiti kii sitambar 2019 main jari report ke anusaar, vitt varsh 2007 main shuru hui intrest subvension skim kii vajah se short turm ke lone kaa hissaa badha he
 The interest subvention was aimed at promoting short-term loans (for yield requirements), but this has led to a decline in long-term loans (for investment needs)
 krishi karj main ghotaalaa!rbi ke aantarik kaarysmooh kii report main yah paaya gaya ki kuch rajyon ko krishi par karj unke samooche krishi jidipi se bhi kaaphi zyada mila he, jo is baat kaa sanket he ki aise karjon ko duusare gaiyr krishi kaaryon main lagaaya ja rahaa he
 Some examples are: Kerala (more than 180% of agricultural GDP), Tamil Nadu (170 to 180% more), Telangana and Punjab (more than 100%)
 kai rajyon ko unke kul input laagat se kaaphi zyada karj mila he
 For example Andhra Pradesh (7
 5 guna), kerala (6 guna), goa (5 guna), telugana, tamilnadu or uttarakhand (4 guna)
 Because of this, the use of such loans has raised question marks
 professor gulati kehete hai ki aisa krishi sector or anya sector ke byaaj dar main baari antar kii vajah se ho rahaa he
 On short-term crop loans, farmers get a loan at a concessional interest rate of 7%, an interest rebate of 2% and a pre-payment incentive of 3%, due to which the effective interest rate is just 4%
 
 isaki tulana main duusare kshetron main byaaj dar 10 fisadi yaa usase zyada he
 He warned that as long as this gap remains, the use of agricultural credit will continue in other works
 nitigat kadam: aadhe man se or tukade-tukade menhaal ke varshon main krishi sankat dur karne ke maamle main mukhya jor nunatam samarthan mulya (MSP) badhaane, gramin rojgaar yojana (MGNREGS) ke liye aavanton badhaane or kisaanon ko 6,000 rupee ke salanaa inakam transfar (pm-kisaan yojana) par rahaa he
 But in the year 2018, it was observed that the increase in the MSP led to a substantial fall in the prices of the agricultural markets across the country, which did not fulfill its original purpose
 MGNREGS yani manaregaa do vajahon se mushkil main chal rahi he: 1
 The wages received under it are less than the minimum wages of the respective states, 2
 pichley kuch varshon main yah dekha gaya ki vaastavik kharch kii tulana main centre sarkaar kaa bajtiy aavanton kam rahaa he
 Low wages are a matter of concern as it is the source of income for about half of rural households - 34% of agricultural households and 54% of non-agricultural households according to nabard's 2016-17 All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey
 jahaan tak piem kisaan yojana kii baat he to isse desh ke sabase garib log baahar hi hai-krishi majdoor, jo ki kul krishi kaarybal kaa 55 fisadi hote hai, jabaki kisaan iskaa 45 fisadi hissaa hi hai

 The Prime Minister has started the Sansad Adarsh gram Yojana today
 is yojana ko lekar saansadon main man main kis tarah kii shankaa-ashanka he, wo unase baatcheet main saamne ai
 Here is the details of the conversation
 
 
 kuch dinon pehle kii baat he
 i met a BJP MP somewhere
 shuruaati pranaam-paati or idhar-udhar kii baatcheet ke baad maine kaha ki aapaki sarkaar to shandaar chal rahi he
 The numbers are also 282 across
 apane boote kii sarkaar he, so langadi lagane vaali koi sahyogi party bhi nahin he
 Therefore, there is no problem of any hindrance in the working of your people
 sab maze main or majbooti se chalata nazar aa rahaa he
 i did not know that my saying so would touch any of his sore eyes
 unka gubaar foot padaa
 
 
 Hey sir, what will be our fun? hamaari koi puch hi nahin he
 It would have been better if we were 12-14 less than 282
 268 hi hote
 Then our government would have known the importance of each MP
 phir hamaari bhi suni jaati
 Now the condition is that if you take some work and go to a minister, you do not listen
 kahata he ki ye nahin kar saktaa, wo nahin kar saktaa
 For this Modi will have to ask, for that he will have to take permission from him
 saansad mahoday aage bole, or aapako kya bataaun
 If any MP goes to Smriti Irani ji for any work in her area, from opening schools, colleges to transfer of people of the region, posting, she refuses
 thodaa bhi jor daalane kii koshish karo, to phone haath main lekar kahati hai modi ji se baat karaun kya
 Now we are good little men
 modi ji se kya baat karenge
 Come back with our file-reply
 saansad mahoday bina ruke bolte ja rahe the
 They started saying that life is getting difficult
 kshetra main jaao, to log kaam ke liye poochhate hai
 Work is not happening here upar se har saansad ko apane kshetra main ek adarsh gaanv banane kii zimmedaari de di he
 Even if the entire MP fills funds, an ideal village cannot be created
 upar se maaramaari ye ki log adarsh gaanv ke liye apane-apane gaanv kaa naam dene kii koshish karne lage hai
 Are angry at not believing
 saansad mahoday kii baat rokkar maine bich main jaanane kii koshish kii ki sabake saamne lottery se tay karne main bhi dikkat he kya
 He said, "oh sir, who considers the lottery
" hamane to sidhaa sa rasta nikaala
 To avoid trouble, we decided to name a village and said that Modi ji has made the final
 ham kyon apane sir par len, jab hamaare haath main kuch he hi nahin
 But there is also a fear that the next time when people go to other villages to ask for votes, the people of that place do not say go to the village where Modi ji has finalized, ask for votes from the same village
 paanch saal main paanch adarsh gaanv bana bhi den, to sirf paanch gaanv ke vot se to jeetenge nahin na
 mps also believe that the motive behind Modi ji's guidelines is good
 wo gramin ilaaqon main bhi bade badlaav chaahate hai
 Want to improve the lives of villagers
 lekin iske liye sansaadhan kahaan se aayega, kitna aayega
 If only mps have to rely on funds, then where will the other works of the entire parliamentary constituency be from? saal main paanch karod rupee kaa matlab sidhe taur par nikaalen to bas paanch kilometre lambii sadak hi ban sakati he isamen
 The MP also said that how much money has been spent in this election
 ye bhi ki 5 saal baad hi sahi chunaav main to janaa he naa
 He needs something
 do number se naa sahi, ek number ke kisi tareeqe se hi
 Money is needed in elections
 saansad ji ne ye bhi bataaya ki jiske kilaaf wo chunaav jitkar aae hai, us ummidavaar ne kis tarah karodon rupee kharche
 Will have to overcome similar candidates next time too
 bhrashtachar or kamishankhori par ankush lage ye to thik he, lekin kshetra main apni raajnneeti bachaane ke liye zaruri he ki kshetra ke logon ke kaam to hon
 Hanging the stick on the head and running it down the edge of the sword will not work
 saansad mahoday kii sidhi shikaayat philhal modi ji se nahin he
 Rather, it was from the ministers who are dealing with mps either by using Modi ji's halo or by showing their fear
 har baat kii khabar rakhane vaale modi ji ko aisa nahin he ki is tarah kii baat kii jaankaree nahin hogi
 But either he is so busy with his responsibilities that the mps do not have time to take care of them at present, or they do not find it as important now
 haalanki baad main kuch saansadon se baat karne par pataa chalaa he ki unhone saansadon ko bharosa diya he ki agali baar chunaav main jane tak aisa bahut kuch ho jayega, jisase boote ve zyaada aatmavishvaas ke saath apane apane sansadeey kshetra ke matadaataaon ke paas ja sakenge
 As a journalist, he used to listen to the problems of common people
 pehali baar he ki is tarah se saansad kii samasya sun rahaa tha
 It felt that when an MP is feeling so helpless, what will he be able to give to the people of his constituency
 sirf zabaani jamaakharch se uskaa to kaam nahin chalegaa
 There are many very practical problems
 kuch saansad ye bhi bataate hai ki abhi sabhi intazaar karo or dekho kii sthiti apana rahe hai
 Seeing his position marginalized, he may become more vocal within the MP party after two years
 kul mila kar pradhanmantri narendra modi jis ‘kasaavat’ ke saath kaam kar rahe hai usase saansadon ke bich ek gubaar bhi punap rahaa he

 First strategy and now politics
 in chand shabdon main prashanth kishor ke bare main bahut kuch kah diya jaataa he
 Born in Bihar, raised, raised, educated and lived in many countries, Prashant Kishore is the vice president of Janata Dal United (JDU) today
 log prem se inhen pike bhi bolte hai
 Such an early entry into politics and becoming the vice-president of a party like JDU itself reveals many characteristics of PK
 pike aise netaa hai jo kaaphi pehle se raajnneeti main vikaas kaa utprerak daalane kii vakaalat karte rahe hai or ve aaj bhi is par kaayam hai
 At the same time, he said that in the next 10 years, his effort is to bring Bihar under different parameters of development in the category of 10 developed states of the country
 ve maanate hai ki iske liye jaruri he adhik se adhik sankhya main yuva raajnneeti se juden
 PK does not make a strategy to win and defeat parties only
 ve iskaa bhi khaakaa khinchate hai ki kaise party ko sansaadhan purna bananaa he taaki uski raajnneeti jansarokaaron se jude
 PK would probably be the first such leader to say outright that "jdu's effort is to make one lakh members of youth who have no political background in two years
" bhavishya main aise logon ko hi party aage badhaane kaa bhi kaam karegi
 "where the parties insist on this, if the activists are trained in political terms, it will be easy to get help from them on the ground, then PK believes that the more ignorant the workers are in the political lesson, the better they will be for society
 ram mandir par baari vikasprashanth kishor kehete hai ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jab ve bijepi ke saath jude the tab ram mandir mudda nahin tha or tab bhi baari bahumat se bijepi chunaav jiti thi
 According to PK, elections can also be won on the issue of development
 bihar main bijepi ke saath unki party kaa gathbandhan bhale ho lekin unka spasht maananaa he ki bijepi or jediu do alag-alag partiyaan hai
 The thinking of both parties is different on many issues, so the thinking on many issues is also one
 donon partiyon ke apane-apane siddhant hai, jis par donon chalati hai
 Some recent incidents of backward PK 0? JDU in political majesty bear witness that Prashant Kishore may be a big strategist but he still has more time to bring political maturity to the ground
 kuch maheenon main unki party ke andar chali siyaasi hulchale bataati hai ki pike badi badi chunavi ranneeti to aasaani se bana sakate hai magar raajnneeti kii raah unke liye itani aasaan nahin
 Then, after his recent statements, PK is seen 'alone' in the party
 jaankaar bataate hai ki pike kii jediu main jab se entry hui he, tab se party ke kai netaa naaraaz bataae ja rahe hai
 Inside, it is also reported that due to the unhappiness of the party leaders on the platform of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'sankalp Rally' held at Gandhi Maidan in Patna, PK was not given a place
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se pike kii najdiki jagajaahir he
 For the same reason, when he was made the vice-president in JDU, the old leaders did not immediately express unhappiness but the leaders are now being vocal in their opposition
 party upaadhyaksh pike ne kuch din pehle kaha tha ki 'rajd nit mahagathbandhan se alag hone ke baad jediu ko endie main na jaakar nayaa janadesh lenaa chahie tha'
 After this statement, many JDU leaders became uncomfortable
 virodh main utre netaaon ne dabi jubaan main kaha ki kisi bhi party ke upaadhyaksh kaa party ke liye gaye bade faisle ke khilaaf diya gaya aisa bayaan samarpit netaa or kaaryakarta ko kabhi manjuur nahin ho saktaa
 Another of his statements could not digest the leader of his party which said that he has made the Prime Minister and Chief Minister in the country, now he will make the youth also mps, mlas
 is bayaan ke baad party ke kai netaa unke virodh main utar aae
 Prashant Kishore's family background: Krishant Kishore was born in 1977 in Buxar district of Bihar
 unke pita kaa naam dow
 There is Srikanth Pandey who is a doctor by profession
 pike ke pita baxur main medical suparitendent rah chuke hai
 Mother's name is Indira Pandey who is a homemaker
 prashanth kishor kii shuruaati padhai-likhaai bihar main hui
 Later he obtained an engineering degree from Hyderabad
 iske baad unhone unicef main naukari kii or yaheen se branding ke kaam main jud gaye
 Prashant Kishore's strategy is considered to be the reason behind the fierce victory of Narendra Modi and BJP in 2014
 'chaay par charchaa' or 'thri di narendra modi' do aise campan rahe jise bijepi kii jeet kaa bada aadhaar mana jaataa he
 However, later his distance from BJP increased and he broke away from it
 ab khabaren ye aa rahi hai ki jediu se pike kaa naata banane ke baavjood bijepi se unki dooriyaan jas kii tas hai
 Congress leader Shashi Tharoor is again in discussion about his tweet
 charchaa kii vajah he twit main istemaal ek behad hi lanbaa or jationgrejishbd, jise lekar soshal media main jabardast hulchale hai
 The special thing is that on the very next day of Tharoor's tweet, Navratri's tweet came from Maam Durga's tweet
 piem ne apane twit mensanskritka jo shabd istemaal kiya he, vah tharur ke angreji ke shabd par bhi baari padataa najar aata he
 Shashi Tharoor is noted for his clean English and enjoys a lot of use in the twitter world for his difficult words
 haal main apni aane vaali kitaab 'da paradoxical president' ke pramotion ke liye unhone khub twit kiye
 In one such tweet, Tharoor used the term floccinaucinihilipilification (fluoxinosinihilipilification)
 is shabd ko lekar kuch soshal media yugers to shashi tharur kaa majaak bhi udaane lage
 Users asked- will the dictionary be purchased free after purchasing this book? Indeed, Shashi Tharoor wrote, 'my new book, The Paradoxical Prime Minister, is anything but a 400-page hard work on' fluoxinocinylipillification '
 My new book, THE PARADOXICAL PRIME MINISTER, is more than just a 400-page exercise in floccinaucinihilipilification

 By the way, this is not the first time that Tharoor has used a heavy word in social media and people have started arguing about its meaning and pronunciation
 iske pehle unhone ek twit main Hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia shabd kaa istemaal kiya tha
 On the other hand, everyone is tweeting in Sanskrit every day to wish pmmodinavratra, on the other hand, the use of the word Karapadmabhyamakshmalkamandalu
 piem ne aise hi ek shloke main 'karpadmabhyamakshmalakmandalu' shabd kaa istemaal kiya, jiskaa arth jaanane ke liye log pareshaan ho gaye
 The PM wrote this Sanskrit verse in a tweet on 11 October - Dadhana Karapadmabhyamakshmalkamandalu
 devi prasidatu mayi brahmacharinyanuttama
is shloke kaa arth he- aap apane karakamalon main maala (daahine) or kamandal (baayen) dhaaran karti hai
 There is nothing better or better than you, o Brahmacharini Devi
 prasann hokar aap ham sab par krupa karen
 Dadhana Karapadmabhyamakshmalkamandalu

 dilli main badmaashon or choron ke hausale buland hote ja rahe hai
 That is why they sometimes take the car of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and sometimes they carry out the robbery in the show room near the police post
 khaastaur se pashchimi dilli main aae din chori kii ghatnaon ke maamle saamne aa rahe hai
 Incidents of theft, snatching and robbery are gradually becoming common in this area of delhi
 showrooms main badi choritaja maamla pashchimi dilli ke khyala ilaake kaa he, jahaan choron ne ek electronic showrooms menchori kii vaardatko anjaam diya
 This is the case of Saturday, in which thieves took away goods worth millions
 police chaowkee ke najadik kichoridelli main chori ke jo maamle saamne aa rahe hai, usamen zyaadaatar aise hai, jo police chaowkee ke aasapaas hi kiye gaye hai
 In such a situation, it is not difficult to guess that there is no fear of police administration among the thieves
 khyala ilaake kaa yah electronic showrooms bhi police chaowkee se mahaj 200 meter kii duuri par he, jisamen police ne chori kii vaardaat ko anjaam diya
 After stealing millions of cctvs in dvrelectronic shop, vicious thieves also kept the DVR of CCTV cameras installed in the shop with them
 lekin paas kii dukaan main lage sisitivi main chori kii sari ghatnaayen kaid ho gayi
 Safety alarm saved by shop CCTV footage shows that a car stops near the shop and the thieves descend
 dukaan kaa shater tod ek-ek karke saamaan car main rakhte hai
 Perhaps they ran away with stolen goods due to the sound of a safety alarm
 dukaan main lage sefti alarm ke bajane se hi chori kaa pataa chalaa
 If there was no safety alarm in the showroom, then the thieves could have committed even greater theft
 logon ko nahin police jaanch par bharosise ghatana ke baad police ne jaanch kaa aashwaasan diya or kaha ki choron ko jald hi pakad liya jayega
 But due to this theft incident being just 200 meters away from the police station, the local people are not confident of the police action
 sthaneey logon kaa aarope he ki chori kii aisi ghatnaayen pehle bhi hoti rahi hai hui, lekin police ne kabhi aisi ghatnaon par sakhti nahin dikhaai or choron ke hausale buland hote rahe
 In the mobile show room, Choripolis is now complaining about the matter by registering a complaint in this matter
 jabaki ek saptaah pehle mayapuri ilaake main bhi choron ne police beet box ke paas hi mobile showrooms main lakhon kii chori kii vaardaat ko anjaam diya tha
 The BJP has once again won the victory in Gujarat, the BJP is forming the government for the sixth consecutive time in the state, and is also showing its charisma under the leadership of Modi
 22 saal baad bhi agar bijepi gujarat kii satta par kabiz hone main kaamyaab rahi he, to ye sirf or sirf modi kii badaulat he
 The road to Gujarat was not easy for the BJP
 khaastaur par tab jab wo party centre main sattadhari ho or uske piem ke griharajya main chunaav hon
 The way in which the atmosphere was created in Gujarat on demonetisation-gst, the anti-incumbency for the BJP was becoming stronger
 vahiin duusari taraf patel aarakshan andolan kii vajah se halaat bijepi ke haath se phisal rahe the to congress kaa haath majboot kar rahe the, sirf satta virdohi lahar yaa phir patidaar aarakshan andolan hi chunauti nahin ban rahe the, balkiachanak dalit or obisi yuva netaonke taur par jignesh or alpesh thakor kaa bhi udai bijepi ke khilaaf maahaul banane laga tha
 The big question inside for the BJP was also that for the first time in 15 years, Narendra Modi was not even the Chief Ministerial candidate in Gujarat
 congress inhen saare samikarnon kii vajah se 22 saal baad satta kii vaapasi kaa mauka talash rahi thi
 But the Congress did not want to understand the story behind the curtain and in its own atmosphere, it saw the defeat of BJP
 lekin gujarat ke matadaata ke man ko agar sahi myne main kisi ne padhanaa siikhaa he to wo piem modi hi hai ji haa modi ne gujarat jeetne ke liye puri takat laga di
 From Kutch area of gujarat, Modi started his mission in Gujarat, and besieged the Congress from Doklam to Pakistan, Modi surrounded Rahul Gandhi on the Doklam issue, saying that when the Indian Army met eye to eye with the Chinese army in Doklam While doing this, he was hugging the Chinese ambassador
 modi ne gujarat chunaav main hafiz said kii rihaai ko bhi khinch liya
 Modi said that when most wanted terrorist Hafiz Saeed was released in Pakistan, the Congressmen were clapping
 gujarat ke liye modi ne 26 / 11 hamale se lekar, uri main aatanki hamale tak, har mudde ko apane prachaar main khinch liya
 Modi even said that the Congress killed many youths during the Mahagujarat movement
 2001 main jab kuccha main bukamp aayaa, to hamaari sarkaar ne yahaan par kaaphi teji se kaam kiya congress ne hameshaa hi gujarat ko bair kii najar se dekha he
 Modi said my training took place in Kutch, the people of Kutch have taught me
 modi ne apane prachaar main kaha ki gujarat meri maa he, mere upar kabhi koi daag nahin tha, lekin congress gujarat main aakar mere upar aarope laga rahi he, mujhe bhala-bura kah rahi he
 The people of Gujarat will never forgive the Congress
 gujarat ke bete par hamalaa yahaan ke log maaf nahin karenge
 If Modi government appeared in Gujarat on demonetisation and GST, then Modi also played emotional card here
 modi ne congress ko vanshavaad or vikaswad kii ladaai par bhi gheraa
 If Modi spread the bag of votes in front of Gujarat, the public also did not disappoint, saying that the old relationship does not work when needed, the voters of Gujarat also did not disappoint Modi and the 22-year-old relationship at the time of need Followed strongly congress kii badazubaani par piem modi kaa obisi card bhi congress kii taraf se tohfa tha, jise koi bhi diggaj raajnneetijna haath se jane nahin detaa, or jaise hi manishankar ne pradhanmantri modi neech bolaa
 He immediately surrounded, then speaking to the Congress parade, Modi said that the Congress is a sign of the Mughal Sultanate
 modi ne kaha ki ayyar kaa bayaan unka nahin balki gujarat kaa apmaan he
 The Prime Minister's cleanliness campaign has become a problem for the people in Bastar
 gaanv ke 500 ghar aise hai, jahaan shauchalay banane ke liye gadde to khod die gaye, lekin shauchalay nahin ban paae
 For a year, the people of the village have been going round the government offices, but their troubles remain the same

 isi gaanv ke kisaan ganga ram ke ghar main bhi shauchalay ke liye gaddha khoda gaya tha
 His buffalo fell in the pit
 gaddha kaaphi gaharaa tha, jiske chalate bhens usamen funs gai
 Despite all the efforts of the villagers, the buffalo could not be saved

 Panchayat department has mocked all people in the name of building toilets
 lekin maamla sirf gaddhon tak simit nahin rahaa he
 Neither the villagers were given the sanctioned money to construct toilets here, nor did the Panchayat Department take responsibility for the construction
 saal bhar se zyada vakt biit gaya
 But no toilet was constructed in any house in this village nor did anyone show any interest to fill the pits
 aise main ye gadde jaanaleva sabit ho rahe he
 Sometimes children of Gir are getting injured
 to kabhi maweshiyon kii maut ho rahi he
 All the people of this village have sought permission to fill the pit
 lekin panchayat vibhaag ne isaki bhi ijaajat nahin di
 Since these pits have been dug through government instructions and government payments
 lihaaja sarkari kaam main hastkshep ke aparaadh se bachane ke liye gramin in gaddhon ko bharne kii himmat bhi nahin juta paa rahe he
 People demanded compensation: The people of Ileka continuously complained to the authorities for a year
 lekin koi hal nahin niklaa
 Now the villagers have complained to the Collector and demanded compensation for the death of cattle
 yahi nahingraminon ne gaddhon ko bharne kimang bhi doharaai he, kyonki barish aate hi in gaddho main pani bhar jayega
 In such a situation, these pits will prove dangerous
 haalanki panchayat vibhaag jald karrwai karne kii baat kah rahaa he
 An amount of 12 thousand rupees was raised, the administration has put a lot of effort to declare two dozen villages of Darbha development block as ODF
 prashasan ke nirdesh par hi in gaddhon ko khoda gaya
 The villagers were promised that the toilet construction would be completed within a month
 shauchalay nirmaan ke liye prayek gharon ke liye 12 hajaar rupaye kii rakam sweekrut kii gai thi, lekin ye rakam graminon ke haath nahin lagi

 He said that India will have to grow on this basis for at least the next 10-15 years

 The demonetisation-gst setbacks were deep, with the former RBI governor acknowledging India's vulnerability to global growth, saying that India is now a very open economy
 yadi duniya vikaas karti he to bharat bhi vikaas karata he
 He said, "it happened in 2017 that even after catching the pace of growth rate in the world, India slowed down

 India works when many people are carrying the burden together
 jabaki aaj bharat main centre sarkaar ke paas shaktiyaan atyadhik kendrikrut hai
 "raghuram Rajan set the example," a lot of decisions have to be taken by the Prime Minister's Office
 jab tak pradhanmantri karyaalay se anumati nahin mil jaati he, koi nirnay nahin lenaa chahta
 This means that if the Prime Minister works even for 18 hours per day, he has this much time
 haalanki, vah kaaphi mehnatee pradhanmantri hai

 This is a big problem

 com / g9fg7eghps — Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor (@officialdgispr) October 27, 2017 Army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor announced through social media that Indian drone aircraft had been shot down in the Rakhchikiri sector
 unhone twit kar kaha, ‘‘bhartiya quadcopter raakhchicari sector main jasusi kar rahaa tha or ise paak sena ke nishanebaajon ne maar giraaya
 Gafoor also claimed that its debris was with the Pakistani Army
 yah duusari baar he jab pakistani sena nenientran rekhaake nikat bhartiya quadcopter ko maar giraane kaa daawa kiya he
 a similar claim was made by Pakistan in November last year
 us samay purv major general aseem bajva ne drone giraane kaa daawa kiya tha
 Let me tell you that last time Pakistan's claim of killing India's spy drone on its land was falsely denied
 sutara bataa rahe the ki kathith drone ko pakistani agenciyaan hi chalaa rahi thim jo kisi vajah se haadase kaa shikaar ho gaya
 Pakistan had blamed India for avoiding shame
 jaankaron ke mutabik, tasviir ke mutabik drone bharat kaa nahin he or china main bana hua tha
 At the same time, making fun of this ridiculous claim, Omar Abdullah tweeted that such toys are with him and if anyone in the Pakistani army wants promotion by dropping him, he can send it by flying to Pakistan
 i have one of these toys as well if you’d like to shoot it down to cement your next promotion please drop me a line I’ll have it sent acrosshttps: / / t
