 Attacking the Congress, Modi said, this time the media people are not paying attention to the propaganda of mother and son
 unki baaten koi nahin sun rahaa
 Modi attacked the opposition parties and said that the opposition is talking gossipily
 modi ko gujarat ke baahar koun jaanata he, koun pahachaanata he, lekin hamen dilli main bahut pyaar mila

 Modi said, in which bank he has an account, he (arvind Kejriwal) knows this, but he does not know whose money is in his account

 In the name of Dalits and Adivasis, billions and trillions of rupees are spent by the government, but where that money goes is not known

 We will do such work, so that corruption ends automatically and everyone gets their rights

 Governor Romney has tried hard to hide his position

 But sometimes it is difficult to say something which is not really true

 unhen (romany) jarurat he ki ve agle saptaah mangalvaar ko bhi behatar pradarshan kar saken
 Obama said, if you have a poor performance, then you go ahead and focus on another opportunity, which further strengthens your intentions
 jab obama se poocha gaya ki kya is kharaab pradarshan kaa matlab chunaavon kaa romany ke paksh main hona he, to obama kaa jawaab tha, nahin

 These things will harm them in the long run
 apni jeet ke bare main aashwast obama ne kaha, agle saptaah tak bahut sa tanaav dur hoga, kyonki in chunaavon main ham aage chalane vaale hai or jeetne bhi vaale hai
 He said, it was a good ceremony
 hamaare paas chaar saptaah bache hai
 No other person is fighting harder than me
 unhen (romany) jarurat he ki ve agle saptaah mangalvaar ko bhi behatar pradarshan kar saken
 Obama said, if you have a poor performance, then you go ahead and focus on another opportunity, which further strengthens your intentions
 jab obama se poocha gaya ki kya is kharaab pradarshan kaa matlab chunaavon kaa romany ke paksh main hona he, to obama kaa jawaab tha, nahin
 At the same time, when asked about his victory in the November 6 elections, he said with confidence, yes
 tippaniyan Speaking to radio presenter Tom Joyner after the October 3 speech, Obama said, "I think i was very polite with Romney during the speech
" lekin kai baar lagaataar vah baat kahana mushkil hota he, jo vastav main sach na ho

 When Obama was asked whether this poor performance meant elections were in favor of Romney, Obama's answer was no
 vahiin jab 6 november ke chunaavon main unki jeet ke bare main poocha gaya, to unhone puri yakeen ke saath kaha, haa
 The comments 3 oktober ke bhaashan ke baad radio par prastota tom joinar se baat karte hue obama ne bataaya, mujhe lagata he ki bhaashan ke dauraan main romany ke saath kuch zyada hi vinamr rahaa
 But sometimes it is difficult to say something which is not really true
 lekin isamen ek acchhee khabar yah he ki yah pehla hi mauka tha
 Governor Romney put all those things in front of people, either in which he is seen running away from his responsibilities or drastically cutting medical facilities
 ye chijen unhen dirghagami nuksaan pahunchaayengi
 Confident of his victory, Obama said, "by next week a lot of tension will go away, because in these elections we are going to go ahead and win

 Education Minister Smriti Irani is once again on social media
 is baar vajah bana he unke mantralay kaa tathakthith letters head jisamen hindi or angrezi ke kuch shabdon kii ssailing galat likhi gai he
 Now if there was another ministry, it is still fine, but how can such a mistake be digested on the letter head of the Ministry of Human Resource Development
 darasal letters head par 'sansaadhan' ko 'sansaadhaan' or angrezi main 'minister' ko 'minster' likhaa gaya he
 The comments puraa maamla kuch is tarah he
 Richa Kumar, a CBSE school teacher in Chhattisgarh, Bhilai, recently posted a letter on Facebook allegedly received from the Ministry of Human Resource Development
 chitthee main unke skool ke bacchon ke achche parinaam aane par unhen badhai di gai thi
 Picture courtesy: richakumar @ Facebook apni post par richa ne smriti irani ko sambodhit karte hue likhaa 'sabhi sibiesai shikshakon ko badhai kii ye chitthee bhejne ke liye dhanyavad
 But i have been teaching the language for the last 20 years, probably because i am not able to ignore the mistakes made on your official letter head
 neeche lagi tasveeron se aapako maamla samaj aa jayega
 It would be better that you make sure that it is read and written before placing people working in your ministry
 ' Richa Irani also had to give her reaction when this letter of Richa started circling on social media
 aise hi ek twit main jab smriti irani se poocha gaya ki kya ye unheen kaa letters head he to smriti ne jawaab diya 'nahin ye meraa nahin he
 i do not even write my name wrong in Hindi

 The whole matter is like this
 chhattisgarh, bhilai ke ek sibiesai skool kii shikshak richa kumaar ne pichley dinon ek chitthee ko fasebuk par post kiya jo tathakthith rup se unhen maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay kii ore se mili thi
 She was congratulated for the good results of her school children in the letter
 tasviir saujany : richakumar@facebook On her post, Richa addressed Smriti Irani and wrote, 'thank you to all the CBSE teachers for sending this letter of congratulations
 lekin main pichley 20 saalon se bhashaa padhaati aa rahi hum, shaayad isliye aapke aadhikarik letters head par hui galtiyon ko nazarandaaz nahin kar paa rahi hum
 You will understand the matter from the pictures below
 acha hoga ki aapke mantralay main kaam karne vaale logon ko rakhane se pehle aap ye sunishchit kar len ki vah pard likhe ho
 ' richa kii is chitthee ne soshal media par jo chakkar lagaana shuru kiya to smriti irani ko bhi apni pratikriya deni pad gai
 In one such tweet, when Smriti Irani was asked if she was his letter head, Smriti replied 'no, it is not mine

 Illegal incursions into the Indian border and then disrupting the holy Mansarovar Yatra have further strained relations between India and China
 seemaa par jo tanaav he uskaa asar sadakon par bhi dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Anger against China is boiling which also showed on the streets of Delhi, the country's capital

 The Chief Minister and the National President of the party, Nitish Kumar, gave the elected mps a chance to decide their candidates, due to which the party had to face defeat
 jediuko ye jhatka aise samay main laga he, jab vipaksh behad kamjor he
 On the other hand, RJD has increased its stature by winning three seats, while Asaduddin Owaisi's party has also opened its account in Bihar by winning the seat of Kishanganj
 endie main santosh kii baat ye he kialgepine samastipur loksabhaa upachunaav main phir jeet hasil kar lee he
 The seat fell vacant after the death of Ramchandra Paswan, ljp's national president and brother of Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan
 algepi ne is seat se prince raaj ko chunaav maidan main utaara tha

 jaahir heprince rajko sahanubhuti vot kaa phayda bhi mila he
 Why did the public get angry with JDU? Darwan assembly seat of Siwan was a seat of prestige for CM Nitish
 chunki yahaan se jediu ne saansad kavita singh ke pati ajay singh ko apana ummidavaar banaaya tha
 The party had nominated Ajay Singh as its candidate, who was not given the ticket earlier, but Ajay Singh was happily accepted by the party after his marriage to Kavita Singh
 ajay singh ke jediu main shaamil hone kaa party sthaneey str par baari virodh hua tha
 Leaders of the allied party BJP were openly opposing the JDU candidate
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki bijepi ke jilaster ke netaaon ke virodh par varisht netaaon kaa maun party kii sahmati dikhaa rahaa tha
 From here, bjp's rebel candidate Karnjit Singh alias Vyas Singh contested the independent election and defeated jdu's Ajay Singh

 Before the show started, the two had revealed their strategies indoors in an interview
 is intervyuu main somi ne yah baat kubul kii thi ki vah yahaan popular hone ke liye ai hai
 He had told the Indian Express, "I always wanted to be famous

 bijepi se alag hone ke baad shivasena ne votaron ko apane andaaj main lubhaane kii koshish kii he
 Uddhav Thackeray has said that when the common man can become the PM, then why won't he become the CM
 uddhav thakare ne shivasena ke mukhpatr 'saamana' ke jariye apana massej votaron ko diya he
 Even though Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not spoken against Shiv Sena or Uddhav Thackeray during the election campaign, Uddhav is missing no opportunity to attack BJP
 uddhav ne lage haathon bijepi ko 'dushman number van' bhi qaraar de diya
 It is worth mentioning that earlier in 'noon Saamna' some more harsh and objectionable words were used against Narendra Modi
 isse yah bhi kaha gaya ki modi or unki party loksabhaa chunaav main unki ekatarfa jeet ke liye shivasena se mili yogadan ko bhul gaye hai
 In an article written by editor Prem Shukla in 'noon Ka Saamna', the BJP did not win the Lok Sabha elections just because of Narendra Modi
 agar shivasena loksabhaa chunaav se pehle apana samarthan waapas le leti, jaisaa ki bijepi ne abhi kiya, to vah (BJP) loksabhaa chunaav jeet hi nahin paati
 However, Uddhav Thackeray later distanced himself from the newspaper article

 this kinda attention seeking is so cheapa smile & politeness from a celebrity would make a world of difference

 makar sankranti ke maukey par bihar congress ne argedy samet mahagathbandhan ke sabhi dalon ko chuda dahi ke bhoj par aamantrit kiya tha
 RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, Rashtriya Lok Samata Party president Upendra Kushwaha and Mukesh Sahni, president of the Vikas Insaan Party, arrived at the banquet held at the Congress office Sadaqat Ashram
 haalanki hindustani awam morcha ke adhyaksh jithan ram maanjhi or loktantric janata dal ke adhyaksh sharad yadav kaarykram main nahin pahunche
 At the dinner table, all the leaders of the Grand Alliance tried to show solidarity
 par jaise hi tejasvi yadav sadakat ashram se vidaa hue, bihar pradesh congress ke adhyaksh madan mohan jha ne mahagathbandhan main siton ke talmail ko lekar aankh dikhaanaa shuru kar diya
 Talking to Aaj Tak, Madan Mohan Jha said that Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh have made a mistake of undermining the Congress, which will have to suffer in the Lok Sabha elections
 unhone kaha ki bihar main siton ke talmail kii jab baat hogi to keval congress hi qurbaani nahin degi
 He said that RJD will also have to sacrifice in the grand alliance
 bataa den ki somvaar ko tejasvi yadav ne kaha tha ki loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ko haraane ke liye siton ko lekar mahagathbandhan ke sabhi dalon ko qurbaani dene ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 However, Tejashwi Yadav once again reiterated that the Congress is a strong part of the Bihar Grand Alliance
 darasal bihar main siton ke talmail ke elaan se pehle congress or argedy donon ek duusare ko lagaataar sandesh bhejne kii koshish kar rahe hai ki koi bhi dal khud ko is mahagathbandhan main bada bhai samajhane kii bhul naa kare
 According to sources, seats in the Grand Alliance in Bihar may be announced soon
 yahaan par seat bantwaare kaa formula taiyaar ho chukaa he
 According to this, RJD 18-20 seats, Congress 8 -12, RLSP 4-5, Hindustani Awam Morcha and Loktantrik Janata Dal can get 1-2 seats
 mana ja rahaa he ki jithan ram maanjhi apni party ke liye 3 seat kii maang kar rahe hai, lekin unki maang puri hoti nahin dikh rahi he
 So he is angry
 isi kaaran se unhone congress ke chuda dahi daavat se khud ko alag rakhaa
 There 4
 5 saal tak NDA kaa hissaa rahe upendra kushvaha ne congress ke chuda dahi kaarykram main shirkat karne ke baad kaha ki unhen pichley 4 saal main NDA netaaon kii taraf se chuda dahi kaarykram main shaamil hone ke liye nimantran miltaa rahaa he magar vah kabhi bhi aise kaaryakramon main nahin gaye

 He was told by Vindu Dara Singh to do so
 gurunath ne yah bhi mana he ki sattebaaji main use 1 karod kaa nuksaan hua he
 Before the life ban on Garunath Meiyappan, the BCCI, which was mired in controversy, suspended Chennai Super Kings CEO Gurunath Meiyappan until a pending probe on his role in the IPL spot-fixing case
 jabaki CSK ne unpar aaajeevan pratibandh laga diya he

 Nadisutra / Manjit Thakuriyah River was once called the mourning of Bengal
 athaah jalarashi, or usase bhi adhik raudra rup
 In the rainy season, this river broke its cool banks and spread to the plains of Bengal and brought destruction
 ji, yah damodar nadi he
 But say Damodar's good luck or bad luck, Damodar Valley Project (DVC) started after independence to curb his flood
 baadh par to khayr ankush laga, par asli najar thi iske basin main maujuud lohe or koyale par
 Countless industries were engaged and to date the Damodar river present in the legends is included in the list of the country's most polluted rivers
 damodar nadi ke kinare 10 taap bijlighar hai jo salanaa koi 24 lakh metric ton raakh paidaa karte hai
 65 in these power stations
 7 lakh metric ton koyale kii salanaa khapat hoti he or isse 8,768 megavott bijli paidaa hoti he
 The game of polluting the Damodar River begins at the Khel Belt Khelari in Ranchi district
 phir ramgarh jile main ghuste hi patratu thermal power stesan or central kolfield limited kii kol vashari is nadi ko or bhi pradooshit karte hai
 The amount of debris from the coal washery is 3 million tons annually
 bokaro jile main ghuste hi ye teen bijlighar damodar main koyale kii raakh sidhe baha diya karte the
 The condition of this river in Dhanbad became so bad that despite all the pressures of the industry, the environment ministry refused to approve new industries in Dhanbad
 jharkhand rajya pradooshan niyantran board (jeespisibi) kii website main damodar main apshisht giraane vaale 94 udyogon ke naam darj hai jinamein adhiktar tapabijli ghar or kol washari hi hai
 Saryu Rai, the leader of the Damodar Bachao Andolan in 2004 and a minister in the Government of Jharkhand, believes that this is the situation when the pollution level of Damodar has improved significantly
 lekin rajya sarkaar kii ek ikai tenughat thermal power plant aaj bhi chori-chupe koyale kii raakh ko sidhe nadi ke kinare daal detaa he kyonki iskaa aish pond ab kisi kaam kaa nahin
 In December (2017) last year, the CPCB directed the closure of the Tenughat plant as it was causing severe damage to the Damodar River
 phir bhi sthiti yah ho gai he ki bokaro ke aasapaas ke log damodar main chhath bhi nahin manaane jate
 Damodar stones have turned water into black and dirty rotten currents
 haalanki jeespisibi ke sadsy sachiv rajeev lochan bakshi kaa daawa he ki pehle ke mukaable pradooshan niyantran ke kanoonon ko kaaphi kadai ke saath lagu karavaaya jaataa he or in utpaadak ikaayiyon kii satat monitoring chalati rahati he
 But its impact on the health of the river is not visible
 san 2011 main zoological survey of india ne damodar nadi kii suuratehaal par ek survey karavaaya tha jisamen taap bijligharon kii vajah se is nadi ke kharaab halaat kaa byoraa maujuud he
 The sulfur going out of the Damodar Valley power stations in the form of gas in the air becomes acid and mixes in the river
 siesamai kii kareeb do dashak puraani report ke mutabik, is gandhak kii maatra kareeb 65,000 ton salanaa se zyada hoti he
 There are nine districts of Jharkhand falling under the Damodar river valley and many cities are inhabited on its banks
 kai paryaavarnavid to damodar ko jaivik registan or kaala registan bhi kehete hai
 Ever with the announcement of the multi-purpose Damodar project, the Government of India had shown the people a vegetable
 philhal sthiti yah he ki damodar kaa pani pine laayak nahin bachaa he
 Skip the water, it is so polluted that people hesitate to even take a bath
 hazaribagh, bokaro evam dhanbad jilon main is nadi ke donon kinaaron par bade kol vashari hai, jo rojaanaa hajaaron ghanalitre koyale kaa dhovan nadi main bahaate hai
 These Kolavasharis include Giddi, Tandwa, Swang, Kathara, Dugda, Barora, Munidih, Lodna, Jamadoba, Patherdih, Sudamdih and Chasanala
 iske saath hi is ilaake main koyala pakaane vaale bade-bade kolbhatthee hai jo nadi ko lagaataar pradooshit karte rahete hai
 The Chandrapura thermal power plant consumes 12 thousand metric tons of coal every day and the ash released from it is dumped in Damodar
 natijatan, damodar nadi ke pani main thos padaarthon kaa maan ausat se kaaphi adhik he
 The water of Damodar river contains heavy metals, iron, manganese, copper, lead, nickel, etc
 Earlier, people believed that bathing in Damodar river cures skin diseases
 par aaj sthiti yah he ki aapane himmat karke damodar main dubkee lagaai to twachaa rog hona tay he
 Pollution in Damodar river has also affected the livelihood of the people here
 kuch dashak pehle tak is nadi main bahut sari naslon kii machhliyaan hoti thim
 But now release fish in poisonous water, any type of aquatic life is impossible
 damodar nadi ke kinare se sate kheton kii mitti jahrili ho gai he or jaankaar bataate hai ki is ilaake main kheton main upaj pachaas fisadi kam ho gai he
 Not only the thermal power plants present in this river, on the banks of Damodar river, many steel plants also run
 kai udyogon ke istemaal kaa or shaharon ke pine kaa pani damodar se miltaa he
 When the Damodar river itself dies, will the purpose of the multi-purpose river valley project named after it finally be fulfilled or will it remain objective? The question is unfortunate but it is equally important to know the answer
 aakhir bhavishya se jo judaa he

 'ghar ghar congress' campagne ke saath grand old party gujarat chunaav main bhaavnaatmak rup se logon ke saath judane ke liye edi chotii kaa jor laga rahi he
 The effort is that the atmosphere created by the party vice-president Rahul Gandhi from the staggered publicity tours of Gujarat was heard during the entire election campaign
 congress gujarat kii chunavi chausar par kitne soch samaj kar paanse phenk rahi he, iskaa saboot he rahul kahin bhi gujarat chunaav dauron ke vakt 'soft hindutv' kii line se alag hote nahin dikhe
 While the Congress is beating hands and feet to regain its lost ground in Gujarat, it is leaving no stone unturned to surround the BJP through young Turks outside the party
 lekin saath hi is baat kaa bhi puraa dhyaan rakhaa ja rahaa he ki congress ke kisi naare yaa jumale ko bijepi ko mudda banane kaa mauka naa mili
 The Congress still remembers the bitter experience of the 2007 Gujarat assembly elections
 tab sonia gandhi kii ore se kahe shabdon 'maut kaa saudagar' ko tatkaaleen mukhyamantrinarendra modior bijepi ne us chunaav main is kadar bhunaaya ki congress chaaron khaane chit najar ai
 This time in the Gujarat election campaign, 'vikas Gando Thayo Chhe' (vikas has gone crazy) was heard very early
 lekin aise shabdon kaa sara siyaasi napha-nuksaan jodakar congress or rahul ne prachaar main isse tauba kar lene main hi apni bhalaai samajhi
 The Congress is taking bold steps to ensure that the political battle of Gujarat is not presented like 'modi vs Rahul'
 khud rahul party netaaon ko pradhanmantri modi par vyaktigat or tikhi tippiyon se parhez rakhane kii naseehat de chuke hai
 Rahul is calling the political battle of Gujarat as 'BJP vs Gujarat's Janata', while also saying that Congress is with the people
 rahul ne gujarat main vyapaar or naukariyon ko hi bhaashan ke centre main rakhaa he
 This is the reason why he has been the biggest attacker on the Modi government's decision to implement demonetisation and GST
 rahul ke naaron main 'jai sardaar' or 'jai bhavani' sunakar bhale hi achraj hota ho, lekin siyaasi lihaaj se rahul aisa karte najar aate hai
 Rahul Gandhi was seen targeting the vote bank against the government by giving the slogan "5-10 industrialists benefit and all upset"
 ab ye ranneeti he yaa kuch or lekin rahul is baar chunaav prachaar main logon se zyada ghulne milane kii koshish karte najar aae
 Selfie with the children or distribute toffees to them, go and photograph them among the tribals, all this was the hallmark of Rahul's new style
 chunavi dauron ke samay rahul kaa logon se sidhe samvaad kaayam karnaa, sawaal-jawaab karnaa, ye sab wo baaten hai jinhone rahul ke bhaashanon ko nai dhar di
 Rahul was seen eating Gujarati food in normal Gujarati dhabas and restaurants in the night, while in the morning he was also seen eating breakfast of Gujarati tea, Khakhara, Fafra
 soshal media par 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne kitni dhak jamaai thi, isse sabak lete huecongresis chunaav main twitor or fasebuk ke jariye prachaar main bhi koi kasar nahin chhod rahi
 Rahul is also seen saying to the people that the BJP has deployed 200 people on social media especially to tarnish their image
 congress gujarat chunaav main apni jeet ko lekar kitni aashwast he ye isi se pataa chalata he ki party internal survey main khud ko gujarat main 120 seat par jeet milane kaa daawa karte nahin thak rahi
 The Congress is also presenting the success of Patidar leader Hardik Patel, OBC leader Alpesh Thakor and Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani as a big success
 congress is ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he ki ye yuva tikdi khul kar party ke prachaar ke liye aage aae jisase ki inke samudaayon kii bijepi ko lekar naaraazgi ko bhunaaya ja sake
 Apart from these communities, the Congress is also working hard to get tribal votes
 congress kii koshish rahul ke 'soft hindutv card' or PODA (patidaar, obisi, dalit, adivasee) ke jariye chunavi naiya paar lagane kii he
 According to sources, the Congress will announce the list of candidates for the 89 seats of the first phase of Gujarat on 16 November
 sutara bataate hai ki congress kii kendriya chunaav samiti kii pehali baithak main 89 siton ke liye sirf 3 muslim ummidavaaron ke naamon par charchaa hui
 Sources reveal that for the first phase, it is proposed to give 21 seats to the most Patidar community (patel)
 pichley chunaav main itani siton main se congress ne sirf 14 par patel ummidavaar utaare the
 Apart from this, Congress is planning to field 16 tribal candidates, 5 SC candidates, 9 Koli community candidates and 12 obc-thakor candidates out of 89 seats
 congress 5 siton par kshatriya ummidavaaron par daanv aajamaa sakati he
 In the first list, 8 women candidates, youth candidates from Youth Congress and NSUI can get Congress ticket
 sutron ke mutabik 89 main se 49 ummidavaar 35 se 50 saal tak kii aayu ke honge

 Shukla said, "there will be no heat inside the car due to the solar panel mounted on the roof
 ek baar asi chalaakar thodi der baad band kar dene par car main kaaphi der tak thandak bani rahegi

 tirki ne bataaya ki abhi itani urja is panel se nahin mil rahi he ki bina petrol yaa dijal ke car ko chalaaya ja sake
 However, later improvements can also be made possible with higher capacity panels

 According to Tirkey, this car will run with a mixture of diesel and biodiesel
 biodijal kii vajah se eendhan kii keemat or khapat kam hogi
 This will keep the car keypad similar to normal cars

 saath hi yadav ne kaha ki maamla saamne aane par nitish kumaar ne ekadam sire se hamaari CBI jaanch kii maang ko khaarij kar diya
 Why did they fear a CBI inquiry? Tejashwi had said that when we visited the Muzaffarpur girl house and kept the scary and inhuman acts done with the girls there in the public domain, then the case was handed over to the CBI under pressure
 nitish kumaar to chaati peet-petakar tatkaaleen samaaj kalyaan mantri manju verma ko nirdosh bataa rahe the
 But when the raw news of the scandal broke and the collusion of Brajesh Thakur's CDR details in the media was exposed and Manju Verma's resignation had to be taken up due to opposition and public pressure
 CM use kyon bachaa rahe the?
 In a series of tweets simultaneously, Tejashwi wrote, "the diary in jail was recovered from the main accused, Brajesh Thakur, which mentioned 'patna wali bade sir'? Did CBI find out who is the 'patna wala big sir'? Did the heat of the CBI investigation reach that 'big head', due to which the CBI officer was transferred in a hurry? Going contrary to the order of the court not to transfer the CBI officer, the CBI director, in contempt of the court, was suddenly transferred to the then investigating officer SP without giving any reason so that he could save the 'patna Saheb Saheb'? Why was this done? ”tejashwi asked that you tell me, is this case not suspicious? Because CBI director level officer is 'someone big' Will you risk taking contempt of court only to save? Later that CBI officer was convicted of contempt of court and punished with fine by the Honorable Supreme Court? Why did CM Nitish transfer the then District Superintendent of Police Harpreet Kaur, who had supported the CBI investigation into the case, instead of honoring her? She was collecting all the information related to the case, so why remove them from Muzaffarpur in a hurry? Chief Minister should reply? railway ne arunachal pradesh kii rajdhani itanagar tak rajdhani express chalaane kii yojana banaai he lekin is prastaav ko sthaneey logon ke virodh kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he

 The comments karnad kii raay ke samaan hi vichaar vyakt karte hue siddharamaiya ne kaha, '
 
 
 If he were born as a Hindu, he would have got the same respect that Shivaji gets in Karnataka and the whole country
 ' unhone kaha, 'hamen kisi vyakti ko uske dharm yaa jati ke najariye se nahin, balki logon ke liye unke dwaara karaae gaye achche kaam ko dhyaan main rakhkar dekhnaa chahie
 ' iske saath hi karnad ne kaha ki acha hota ki devanhalli ke bengaluru antarrashtriya hawaii adde kaa naam kempegauda ke badale tipu sultan ke naam par rakhaa jaataa, kyonki kempegauda swatantraaa senaanee nahin the
 He said that it would be more appropriate to name the airport after Tipu Sultan, as Devanhalli was his birthplace
 karnad ne kaha, 'main is baat se avgat hum ki main jo kah rahaa hum, us par bahes hogi
 
 
 As we know that Kolkata airport is named after Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Mumbai airport is named after Shivaji Maharaj but in Karnataka we have named it after Kempegowda
 ' hawaii adde ke naam ko lekar karnad kii tippanee par bhaajapa ne nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki unhone begaluru ke sansthaapak kaa aise mudde par apmaan kiya he, jo 'band adhyay' he
 Siddaramaiah, expressing the same view as Karnad's opinion, said, '
 
 
 agar vah hindu ke rup main paidaa hote to karnataka or puure desh main unhen vahi sammaan miltaa jo shivaji ko miltaa he
 'he said,' We should not look at a person from the point of view of his religion or caste, but keeping in mind the good work done by him for the people
 ' Along with this, Karnad said it would have been nice that the Bangalore International Airport at Devanhalli would be named after Tipu Sultan instead of Kempegowda, as Kempegowda was not a freedom fighter
 unhone kaha ki hawaii adda kaa naam tipu sultan ke naam par rakhana adhik uchit hoga, kyonki devanhalli unka janmasthan tha
 Karnad said, 'I am aware that what i am saying will be debated
 
 
 jaisaa ki ham jaanate hai ki kolkata hawaii adde kaa naam netaji subhaashachandr bose ke naam par he, mumbai hawaondde kaa naam shivaji maharaj ke naam par he, lekin karnataka main hamane iskaa naam kempegauda ke naam par rakhaa he
 Taking a dig at Karnad's remarks about the name of the airport, the BJP said that they have insulted the founder of Bengaluru on an issue which is a 'closed chapter'
 iske saath hi karnad ne kaha ki acha hota ki devanhalli ke bengaluru antarrashtriya hawaii adde kaa naam kempegauda ke badale tipu sultan ke naam par rakhaa jaataa, kyonki kempegauda swatantraaa senaanee nahin the

 After making extensive visits to 15 flood-affected villages in Cuddalore district on Monday, Siddharth said, "social media is a boon in efforts to provide relief and on the other side it is a curse

 apane maweshiyon ko charaane ke liye gaderiye is kshetra kaa istemaal karte rahe hai kyonki yah ladakh ke anya kshetron kii tulana main garm rahata he
 Norbu underlined that this is another attempt by China to stake claim to the area as the dispute is similar to that of the Nag Tsang area in front of Phuktse airfield in 1984, Nakung in 1991 and Lungma Serding in 1992
 dokabug or doli tongo kshetra main har varsh disambar se march ke bich gaderiye or khanaabadosh jate rahete hai

 The central bank increases the repo rate at most times when inflation in the country remains under pressure
 aise main ise niyantran main laane ke liye repo rate ahm saadhan banataa he
 The increase in repo rate by RBI helps in controlling inflation
 jab bhi arabiai repo rate badhaata he, to bank usase kam karj lete hai

 This effect on you is the increase in the repo rate means that the funds that banks will take from RBI, they will get it at expensive rates
 isse bainkon par dabaav badhata he
 To reduce their burden, banks pass it on to customers

 For this reason, whenever the repo rate increases, it becomes expensive for you to take a loan
 bataa den ki bhartiya rigerv bank ne farvari main bhi byaaj daron main koi badlaav nahin kiya
 During this time, experts had already expressed its potential

 Because of this, it was believed that the rates would not decrease

 During this time RBI repa rate 0
 25 fisadi ghataya tha
 It was only after this cut that the repo rate was reduced to 6 percent

 Inside these snow huts, there are all the things of the soldiers living and eating, but it is necessary to avoid the deadly attack of nature more than the enemy

 At the same time, when it comes to Diwali, for them the country is before the family

 In Ranchi, new revelations are being made in the matter of the sale of children from a home belonging to the 'missionaries of Charity'
 ab mishanri of charities kii giraftaar sistar consoliya ne sweekaar kiya he ki usne charities ke balashray se teen bacchon ko paise lekar bechaa or ek bachche ko bina paise liye hi kisi ko de diya
 According to the news agency language, Ranchi's SSP Anish Gupta told that Sister Consolia, arrested in this case, confessed his crime to the police and clearly said that he had sold three children with money to the buyers, whose police has recovered
 usne bataaya ki ek bachche ko usne bina paise liye hi kisi ko diya tha
 Police is trying to locate the fourth child
 is bich police kii poochtacha kaa ek video bhi media ke saamne soshal media ke madhyam se aayaa he jisamen sistar apana aparaadh kabool kar rahi he
 In contrast, the missionary bishops denied Sister's hand in the case
 isse purv ranchi ke nagar police adheekshak aman kumaar ne bataaya ki mishanri se beche gayi chauthe bachche kaa ab tak pataa nahin chal sakaa he lihaaja uskaa pataa lagane or is puure cond main shaamil racket kaa pardaafash karne ke liye police ne sistar consoliya or indwar ko kal shaam remand par liya
 The application for questioning them on remand was made in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate Swayambhu, which he accepted
 kumaar ne bataaya ki donon ko police ne vaidhanik prakriya puri kar kal shaam remand par liya tha
 The police have already recovered three children sold in this case
 isse purv guuruuvaar ko indian bishps conference ke mahasachiv bishap theodor masahrenhas ne yahaan daawa kiya tha ki madar terresa kii‘mishanrij aaf charity’bacchon kii kharid-farokht se jude haal main ujagar hue racket main bilkul bhi shaamil nahin he or yadi koi ek sistar is maamle main doshi bhi he to uski galati ke liye puri mishanri ko badnaam nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Bishop Mascarenhas said at a press conference here, "missionaries of Charities is not involved in the sale of children at all
" vaise to is maamle main giraftaar sistar concilia ne bhi apane vakil ko bataaya tha ki vah bacchon ko bechney main kahin se bhi shaamil nahin he
 Under pressure from him, the police took the statement that he had sold the children
 ’’bishap ke daavon kaa khandan karte hue ranchi ke varisht police adheekshak anish gupta ne pehle hi kaha tha, ‘‘ indian bishps conference ke mahasachiv bishap theodor masahrenhas dwaara diya gaya bayaan puri tarah se galat or bebuniyaad he
 After arresting Sister Concilia of the Missionary of Charities in connection with the sale of children to the police, three of the four children were raided and rescued from various locations on the basis of his statement and information received from him
 aise main yah baat kaise sahi ho sakati he ki sistar se police dabaav main bayaan liya gaya he?’’ Kings XI Punjab have been out of IPL 10, but the mentor of this team Virender Sehwag has not lost his enthusiasm about this tournament
 yahi kaaran he ki unhone theatre main pikchar dekhte hue bhi mobile par mumbai indiens or rising pune superjoint ke bich ipel match dekhne ko mauka talash hi liya

 Every year there are clashes between Bollywood films
 bollywood ke stars or producers apane liye badhiya se badhiya date fiks rakhana chaahate hai taaki unhen darshakon kaa pyaar or bijness donon mili
 In such a situation, the presence of clash is often avoided
 lekin bahut baar aisa nahin hota or ham sabhi ko do yaa do se zyada filmein box offis par ek duusare se takaraati najar aati hai
 The same is going to happen this week
 is shuukravaar, 20 sitambar ko sonam kapur kii da joya factor, sanjay dutt kii film prasthaanam or sani deol ke bete karan deol kii film pal pal dil ke paas cinemagharon main takaraane ja rahi hai
 It will be interesting to see the collision of these three films
 kyon? aaie bataate hai
 1
 star powersbase pehali baat star power kii, jahaan sanjay dutt bollywood ke baba hai vahiin sonam kapur ne bhi badi filmein karke naam kamaaya he
 Talking about Karan Deol, he belongs to the Deol family, which is one of the famous families of Bollywood
 unke dada dharmendra, pita sani or chachaa bobi dashakon se bollywood kaa hissaa hai
 Along with this, this is Sunny Deol's first film as a director
 aise main karan deol kii acting ke saath ye dekhnaa bhi dilachasp hoga ki sani kaa diarection kya kamaal karata he
 2
 hit kii jaruratjahan karan deol ke kariyar kii ye pehali film he vahiin sonam kapur or sanjay dutt kii saal 2019 kii duusari film he
 Sanjay had earlier worked in Karan Johar's film Kalank and Sonam looked like a girl in Shaili Chopra Dhar's film
 jahaan kalank bahut buree tarah flop hui thi vahiin ek ladki ko dekha to aisa laga kuch khaas kamaal nahin dikhaa pai thi
 Both of them have the responsibility to deliver a hit film and the fans have many expectations from both the films
 3
 Different Flavorsonam, Sanjay and Karan Deol are the three films of different flavors / genres
 jahaan sonam kapur kii film lucky charm bani ladki or andhvishwaas ke bare main bataaegi
 On the other hand, Sanjay Dutt's film is a completely political drama
 iske alaava karan deol starer ek lav story he
 Fans have many reasons to watch all three films as all three are of the genre audience's liking
 aise main sabase zyada pyaar janata kise degi ye dekhne vaali baat he
 4
 box offis par ladaayeeham sabhi ne bollywood main bahut se klesh dekhe hai
 In such a situation, one film wins and the other loses
 aisa bahut kam hi hota he ki do filmon ke klesh main donon hi filmein hit ho jaaen yaa flop ho jaaen
 But now when the competition is between Sanju Baba, Sonam and Karan Deol, everyone's eyes are fixed on whose victory and whose defeat will be
 in sabhi filmon kii charchaa jor-shor se ho rahi he
 Now what happens to this collision on Friday, it will only tell the time to come
 mahangaai ek baar phir aam aadmi kii qamar todane ke liye taiyaar he
