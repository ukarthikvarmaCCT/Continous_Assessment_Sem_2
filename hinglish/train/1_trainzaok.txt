 When the Election Commission failed to take a decision on the basis of two tests, the Commission made the majority test the basis
 chunaav ayog ne party sanghathan ke saath hi loksabhaa or vidhansabha main donon samoohon ke bahumat kaa pataa lagaaya
 The Election Commission observed that Jagjivan Ram's group has a majority of people in the organization and Lok sabha-vidhan Sabha

 Fadnavis had on Monday targeted the bjp's long-time ally Shiv Sena, saying the Shiv Sena should know that it cannot play the role of the ruling party and the opposition together
 shivasena ke mukhpatr ‘saamana’ main ek sampadakeey main kaha gaya he, ‘‘hamane rajya main vikaas or ‘achche din’ ke liye mukhyamantri pad par aapkaa bade dil se samarthan kiya tha
 But if people think that bedbugs would do a better job than you, then Shiv Sena is not responsible for this

 The editorial says that the Chief Minister talks about the important work being done in the areas of skill development, employment generation, foreign investment, education, women and child development and law and order

 isamen kaha gaya he, ‘‘kal chunaavon ke dauraan koun aapke saath hoga, iskaa faisla aapako karnaa he
 If Shiv Sena is not with you, then you have already decided to seek the support of those who are accused of irrigation scam

 ’’ If you talk about beautiful skin and makeup, then every woman wants to remain attractive and beautiful all the time
 lekin kya aap vaaki jaanati hai ki achche mechap kii sahi paribhaasha kya he, kaise bina mechap kiye bhi ke bhi aap har samay confidence feel kar sakati hai
 The answer to all these questions is with Bollywood's famous makeup artist Namrata Soni

 unhone bataaya ki kaise koi mahila bina kiye bhi aakarshak najar aa sakati he
 Let's know what Namrata Soni does to keep herself, what is her beauty secret
 rojaanaa aise karen twachaa kii dekhbhaal-mechap mastro namrata soni bataati hai ki twachaa ko khubasurat banaae rakhane ke liye aapke paas ek acchhee company kaa moishcharizer, sanscreen kriim or nite kriim jarur honi chahie
 Apart from this, you should use lip balm, kajal pencil, mascara, and a good BB cream to keep yourself attracted
 namrata kaa maananaa he ki acha dikhne ke liye aapako chehre par khub sara mechap lagane kii jarurat nahin hoti
 You can also look beautiful with the help of these three things
 santan dur ko aise rakhen dur-twachaa ko dhoop or santan se bachaane ke liye namrata soni ek acchhee company kii sanscreen kriim, jisamen SPF 50 ho istemaal karne kii salaah detii hai
 Apart from this, she recommends applying gram flour and milk on the face to cure sun tan

 This is because when you apply makeup on the face, a layer of makeup is formed on your skin which protects it from dust, dirt and many types of bacteria present in the air
 mechap chehre ke khule romachhidron main in sabakaa pravesh hone se roktaa he
 With cleansing of face, dust and bacteria on the face along with makeup are also cleaned

 bijepi or shivasena ke bich gathbandhan hoga yaa nahin, ise lekar suspence gaharaa gaya he
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, who sent his two messengers to Delhi for talks with BJP, returned to Mumbai on Wednesday morning without meeting Rajnath Singh and JP Nadda
 shivasena ne maanga dipti CM kaa padapako bataa den ki aagaamee sarkaar par baatcheet karne ke liye shivasena ne anil desai or subhash desai ko kaman saunpi he
 Both leaders came to Delhi on Tuesday
 ye donon rajnath singh or jepi nadda se buudhvaar ko milane vaale the, lekin ve mulaakaat kiye bina mumbai laut gaye
 Why this happened is not yet clear
 sutara bataate hai ki maharashtra main sarkaar banane ko lekar bijepi or shivasena ke bich parde ke peeche bhi baatcheet ho rahi he
 In such a situation, these Shiv Sena leaders will have to send a message to Uddhav, due to which they returned
 jaankaar bataate hai ki abhi bijepi vidhayak dal kaa netaa bhi nahin chunaa gaya he, aise main sarkaar banane ke formule or mantralay ke bantwaare ko lekar koi bhi baatcheet bemaani he
 bjp's planbjp sources say that the party wants to keep pressure on the Shiv Sena and Uddhav Thackeray so that they lower their expectations
 bijepi ko lagata he ki satta main bhagidaari ko lekar uddhav par shivasena kaaryakartaaon kaa jabardast dabaav he
 The BJP has advised the leaders of its party to mediate that they should remain Vinram but do not succumb to unreasonable demands
 agar shivasena se gathbandhan nahin ho paata he to party maharashtra main alpsankhyak sarkaar chalaane ko taiyaar he, jise nirdaleey or baahar se ensipi kaa samarthan praapt rahegaa
 The BJP high command felt that the announcement to support Sharad Pawar from outside is a political masterstroke, a decision that undermined the bargaining power of the Shiv Sena
 shivasena kii mangasutra bataate hai ki shivasena chaahati he ki sarkaar 1995 ke gathbandhan ke us formule par hi bane, jiske mutabik bade dal kaa mukhyamantri or chote dal kaa up mukhyamantri bananaa tay kiya gaya tha
 Also, ministries like Home, Finance, Irrigation, PWD and Rural Development were also mentioned in Shiv Sena's account
 lekin ab ke halaat main shivasena kii kitni baat maani jaaegi, iskaa sanket bhi om maathur de chuke hai
 He had said, 'the formula of 1995 was given, so neither we were nor Uddhav
 samajhadaar vartmaan sthiti ko dhyaan rakhata he
 ' mahila shikshak maamle main nayaa mode aa gaya he
 a letter has been issued by the government which is of the time of Harish Rawat government in 2016
 is chitthee main uttara bahuguna ko ek maheene ke andar skool jwine karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 Failure to do so was also ordered to end his services
 haalanki, is dauraan uttara bahuguna ke pati kii tabiyat kharaab rahi or kuch samay baad unka dehanth ho gaya
 At such a time, anyone can understand what their mental state will be
 yahi vajah rahi ki wo 2017 tak skool ja hi nahin pain or na hi unako kisi tarah kaa koi notice hi mila
 No further information was received from the department
 uttara bahuguna ne sthiti saamaanya hone ke baad phir se 2017 main skool jwine kiya
 Now the question is, if she was relieved of service in 2016, then how can she join school in 2017
 aise main ab prashashan par sawaal uthne laazmi hai ki aakhir kaise bina jaankaree ke hishiksha sachivne press vaarta kii
 If the talk of the press is correct, then there is no justification for this letter

 The officer had said that during the raid, the police arrested 9 members of the hotel management staff and 6 customers

 But insiders familiar with the Shiv Sena's way of working say that it was a decision taken at the last moment
 thakare biemasi ke chunaavon main bijepi ke saath janaa chaahate the, lekin party ke bade netaaon ne unhen aisa karne se roka, kyonki unhen lagata tha ki bijepi ne sena kii keemat par rajya main apana aadhaar badha liya he
 "BJP leaders repeatedly called him (thackeray) the 'mafia'," says Ramdas Kadam, an environment minister and senior Shiv Sena leader in Maharashtra's coalition government

 jammu-kashmir par charchaa ke dauraan loksabhaa main charchaa ke dauraan congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue grih mantri ne kaha ki jammu kashmir kii awam or bharat kii awam ke bich ‘‘ek khai paidaa kii gai kyonki pehle se hi bharosa banane kii koshish hi nahin kii gai 
 "shah said," as far as Article 370 is concerned
 
 
 ye asthaayee he, sthaayee nahin
 370 is a temporary issue of our Constitution
 '' unhone kaha ki jo desh ko todna chaahate hai unke man main dar hona chahie
 The people of Jammu and Kashmir should not be afraid
 amit shah ne kaha ki modi sarkaar aane ke baad aatankwaadiyon se kadai se nibata gaya
 He said, "(congress leader) Manish Tiwari is questioning the partition of the country today, i want to ask him who had divided the country?" Today, one-third of Kashmir is not with India, because of which? ”tiwari, while participating in the discussion, referred to the state of partition of the country and said that our government had assigned a calm and safe Kashmir to the BJP government
 shah ne kaha ki ham kashmir kii awam kii chintaa karne vaali sarkaar hai
 Till date, Panchayats were not given the right to choose Panch and Sarpanch
 shah ne kaha ki'' sirf teen hi parivaar itane saal tak kashmir main shashan karte rahe
 "gram panchayats, nagar panchayats should govern all and the government should run the same
 aisa kyon hona chahie? grih mantri ke jawaab ke baad sadan ne jammu kashmir main raashtrapati shashan lagane sambandhi sanvidhik prastaav or jammu kashmir aarakshan sanshodhan vidheyak 2019 ko dhvanimat se manjuuri de di
 The question is whether Article 370, related to Jammu and Kashmir, has been expressed by the Home Minister Amit Shah in the manner that it is a temporary issue of the Constitution, is it the same reality
 is mudde par raveesh kumaar ke prime time main NALSAR vishvavidhyalayake vaais chancelar faijan mustafa kaa kahana he ki is mudde par kai baar bahut dibet ho chuki he, or is par vichaardhaara ke hisaab se bhi baaten rakhi gai hai
 Instead of giving any opinion of his own, he said, 'it has been said by the Supreme Court that the word temperari (provisional) has come under the heading of Article 370 but it does not mean that it is a temporary provision
 agar vah tempereri hota to pichley 70 saal main jo 43 order ishyu hue jinase bharat ke samvidhan kaa zyaadaatar hissaa kashmir ke upar lagu kar diya gaya
 So what we have implemented will all end if we accept 370 as temporary
 faijan mustafa ne aitihaasik tathyon kii baat karke kaha ki raja hari singh jis samjhaute ke tahat bharat main shaamil hue the usamen unki kuch sharten bhi thim un sharton ko 370 bal detaa he
 The word Temperari was kept in its heading because it had to refer to the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir
 samvidhan sabha ne ise dekhakar isko chaalu rakhane kaa anumodan kiya
 When the Constituent Assembly of Kashmir stamped it, this assembly was dissolved
 or ab agar isamen koi parivartan karnaa he to anuchhed 370 main likhaa he ki iske liye kashmir kii samvidhan sabha se phir anumodan lenaa padegaa
 But because the Constituent Assembly has been dissolved, it is believed that now Article 370 has become permanent, now nothing can happen in it
 faijan mustafa ne aage kaha ki doosraa vichaar yah he ki kashmir ke logon par is par raay jaani jaae to iske liye vahaan kii vidhansabha se anumodan liya jaae to rajya kii janata kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 Along with this, he also denied that the Home Minister Amit Shah said that Kashmir problem is owed by Nehru
 unhone kaha ki pandit nehru ek kashmiri brahman the or vah dil se kashmir ko bharat main shaamil karnaa chaahate the
 But Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel wanted Hyderabad to somehow join India even if Kashmir went to Pakistan
 lekin nehru is baat par raji nahin the
 Faizan Mustafa says that if Kashmir is a part of India today, some credit should also be given to Nehru
 haalanki faijan mustafa ne amit shah kii is baat ko mana ki congress ke jamaane main jammu-kashmir main chunaav main gadabadi hui thi
 He said that Amit Shah's assertion that he will not allow Kashmiriyat to be Dalit proves that he is now on his way to becoming a Statesman

 ' Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Sakshi Maharaj today raised a new controversy, alleging that madrasas are the bastion of terrorism education
 uttar pradesh ke unnav se saansad sakshi maharaj ne nademau main yojit ek samaaroh se itar samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main aarope lagaaya ki madrason main rashtriyata kii shiksha nahin di jaati he
 He said that tell me a single madrasa here where the tricolor is hoisted on 15 August and 26 January
 unhone aarope lagaaya, 'madrason main aatankwaad kii shiksha di jaati he
 It is not in the interest of the nation to make terrorists and jihadis merely by teaching the Quran
 ' The BJP MP questioned the government aid given to the madrasas and said, 'most of our schools do not take any assistance from the government, while all the madrasas who do not belong to nationality are given government support
 ' Meanwhile, the ruling Samajwadi Party (SP) provincial spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary called Sakshi Maharaj's statement childish, divisive and reprehensible
 unhone kaha ki sakshi maharaj ne apni party kii raah par chalate hue nafrat bharaa bayaan diya he
 Its purpose is to divide the society and create distances between different classes
 aise logon ke bayanon par dhyaan dene kii jarurat nahin he
 Chaudhary said that no religion advocates or advocates terrorism and it is extremely objectionable to witness Islam and madrassas linking terror with Sakshi Maharaj
 vahiin ol india muslim personal laa board ke sadsy moulana khalid rashid farangi mahali ne sakshi maharaj ke bayaan ko haasyaaspad qaraar dete hue kaha ki agar bhaajapa saansad ko quran or bhaichaare kii hi shiksha dene vaale islam ke bare main ratti bhar bhi ilm hota to vah aisa bachakaana bayaan nahin dete
 He said that every educational institution has its own curriculum and linking the education system of madrasas with the teachings of terrorism is a sign of Sakshi Maharaj's ignorance, imprudence and immaturity

 yahi nahin, pichley saal jadhav ko jab pakistan ne pakadaney kaa daawa kiya tha tab giraftaar kii jagah ko lekar vivaad ho gaya tha
 Pakistan said that he has been arrested from Saravanan
 baluchistan ke grahamantri ne kaha tha ki chaman se pakadaa gaya he

 bharat ne kasaab ko chaar saal trial kaa mauka diya
 The trial went from trial court to the Supreme Court
 kasaab to camere main aatank machaate hue pakadaa gaya tha
 The verdict has been ruled against Kulbhushan Jadhav in a secret trial
 bharat ne kulbhushan jadhav kii khabar par kadi pratikriya di he
 The Foreign Ministry has said in its response that if Jadhav is hanged, there will be pre-planned murder
 pakistan ne kanoon or insaaf ke buniyadi usulon kaa paalan nahin kiya he
 India demanded counsel access to Kulbhushan 13 times, but Pakistan refused
 trial ke bare main bharat ko bataaya bhi nahin gaya tha
 India has responded by calling Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit
 pakistan ke akhbaar don ne likhaa he ki kulbhushan ko kanoonee praavdhaanon ke anusaar bachaav paksh kaa vakil diya gaya tha
 According to the newspaper, Jadhav's trial and punishment declaration is unexpected
 pakistan ke export ise bharat ko kadaa sandesh ke rup main dekh rahe hai
 Experts in India are hoping that Pakistan will gain wisdom
 or unhen ummid he ki rajanyikon ke prayaas se sazaa taali ja sakati he
 They also say that it is very rare that a detective is punished
 sheet yuddh ke dauraan america or rus apane jasuson kii adla-badali kar liya karte the
 In this phase of minimum level of relations between India and Pakistan, is it possible that Kulbhushan gets justice
 pakistan ke raksha mantri khwaja asif ne kaha he ki kulbhushan jadhav ko kanoon ke hisaab se maut kii sazaa mili he
 This punishment is a warning to enemies
 imran khan kii party taharik-e insaaf ne faansee kii sazaa kaa samarthan kiya he
 There is a situation here as well
 kaha he ki puraa desh faisle kaa samarthan kar rahaa he
 But there is one person in Pakistan who is opposing the decision
 jiskaa bharat main mazaaq udaaya jaataa he, pakistan main to mazaaq udata hi he
 People's Party of Pakistan Chairman Bilawal Bhutto has said, "I do not believe in the death penalty
" main siddhanton ke aadhaar par faansee kii sazaa kaa virodh karata hum
 ' kya sarbajit kii tarah kulbhushan kii faansee bhi ham dekhte rah jaayenge
 Is there any diplomatic route still left that could save Kulbhushan
 haal hi main sanyukt raashtra main america kii rajdoot nikki hele ne kaha tha ki pakistan or bharat ke bich america madhyasthata karne ko taiyaar he
 We feel that tension is increasing
 bharat kaa focus bangladesh kii taraf he
 Which is also correct
 lekin pakistan se bharat ne munh hi mode liya he
 Is there any way left to stop Kulbhushan Jadhav being hanged or are we going to get what was found after Sarabjit's coverage for hours and months continuously
 isse pehle 1999 main shaikh samim ko bhi pakistan main faansee di gai thi
 Both were accused of espionage
 tippaniyan In response, India has refused to release Pakistani prisoners
 in kaidiyon ko buudhvaar ke din choda janaa tha
 The Government of India feels that this is not an appropriate time to release them

 Do you think your new film, The Song of Scorpions (which premiered at the Locarno Film Festival on August 9) will prove to be phenomenal in world cinema? It is a love story from above but the love between a man and a woman would have nanya poli tics Is, he deals with it
 isamen landscape ek bahut bada kairactor he
 And sound
 registan main aap travel karen to sound kaa ehsaas hota he
 Which language is this film in? Language is its Rajasthani and Hindi
 isamen baahar ke bhi producers hai to yah basikali ek european production he
 It cannot be called Indian production
 lekin rajasthani prishthbhumi vaali is film ke liye irani actress gulshifte farhaani ko lene kaa faisla aakhir kis tarah hua?gulshifte kii kahani ye he ki main or anup (singh, film ke nirdeshak) abudhabi festival main the
 There we saw a movie My Sweet Paper Land
 usamen wo ek hangdram baja rahi thim
 i told Anoop, friend, can we bring this girl? We wanted a face that is landscape in itself and which has the sensitivity of music
 film mujisian ke upar he or wo usamen gayika hai
 Anoop spoke
 iranian ladki ke liye rajasthani bolnaa, ye sab karnaa ek chalange tha
 He took the challenge
 unka kamaal kaa kaam rahaa
 As far as the challenge is concerned, recently you have come across Mark Turtletob's Puzzle in New York
 usamen aapke liye kya chalange tha?usamen kamaal kii simple riting he
 And there are so many things hidden in that preliminality that you have to work twice as hard
 us simplicity main itane shades, itane colors hai, us tak pahunchane main aapako vakt lagata he
 It would have seemed many times that the friend did not put anything in it
 usamen zyada mehnat hoti he
 Recently, even in the storm of Bahubali 2, your Hindi medium held a united front
 uske halle main film utaarte dar nahin laga tha?hamen dikkat hui thi bahubali ke aage aane main
 The release was a week long since there was no theater
 or wo (bahubali2) vikdes main bhi 5-5, 6-6 karod kaa bijness kar rahi thi
 So i moved forward a week
 uske baavjood hamako hajaar theatre bhi nahin mil rahe the
 But we started showing the film five days ago
 mujhe ab tak yaad he, ek screening ke baad discshan chal rahaa tha ki yaar ye bahubali to ruk hi nahin rahi he
 But some journalists believed that this film would change the flow a bit due to its content
 content vid antertenment
 Over the years, i have been trying to redesign mainstream commercial cinema
 hindi medium kaa bahubali2 ke saath aake khadaa hona or cross kar janaa, ye apane aap main ek nishaani he ki logon ko content chahie, antertenment main freshnes chahie
 Audience footfall is decreasing in Hindi films
 log subject se rilate nahin kar rahe hai
 There is a general approach to telling a story
 footfal ja rahaa he hollywood kii ore, jisane pehle bhi kai deshon kii industries ko apahiz kar diya he
 On the one hand we are becoming so narrow, the censor board is placing strange conditions
 duusari taraf apane daravaaje khol die (hollywood kii filmon ke liye)
 Why is there no cap? And there is a huge audience shift to Netflix
 iske aane se revenue badha he
 Movies on it are coming two weeks later
 log dyside karte hai ki netflix par dekh lenge
 You have worked with many foreign actresses here
 unke saath behatar talmail kaa aapkaa sutara kya hota he?aai think, duniya bhar ke actors kii ek ankahi anderstanding hoti he
 There is only one way to do their work
 usamen kuch edjust karne kii jarurat nahin padati
 Being someone's foreigner does not make his acting foreign
 acting universal he
 The borders of the country cannot divide the discipline of acting
 paansingh tomars kii relies ke liye aapako teen saal intjaar karnaa padaa tha or da sang of scorpeons bhi dedh saal baad aa rahi he
 The post production of Scorpions was such a tall plot
 shoot ke baad editing ke liye saal bhar lenaa, ye ek french tarika he
 There is no delay in this at all
 aai think, paansingh ek aisi film he, jisaki ki waisi merit hote hue bhi itnaa wet karnaa padaa
 Sometimes studios do not have confidence
 isiilie uske baad hi maine sochaa ki bataur produsar apana ek dakhal hona chahie
 Recently, some people were agitated by your speaking on religious bigotry
 ab us episod ke bare main kya lagata he?mujhe lagata he, baat karne kaa koi plateform, koi jagah hi nahin he
 There is no guarantee of how much your talk will become a spectacle
 usase aapako ehsaas hota he ki is jamaane kaa jo media he, vah logon kii soch ko kis tarah se shape kar rahaa he
 Definitions of journalism have changed
 ab to log khul ke bol rahe hai ki hamaara apana vyuu he, ham wo bataaenge
 Mainstream media is becoming propaganda, real people, who want to do accurate reporting, are able to find their platform because of the internet
 demokrasi main jab tak ek sahi kism kaa critisism nahin he, wo demokrasi punap nahin sakati, wo protective demokrasi kabhi nahin ho sakati
 These days there is a storm of nationalism all around
 bataur ek actor ye ghatnakram aapako kya sochane par majaboor karte hai?ab to actor ko kaha ja rahaa he ki aap actor hai actor bane rahiye
 There is no need for your consultation
 usko bataaya jaataa he ki aap kuch bhi aisa bolenge jo hamen suut nahin karata to ham aapkaa dhandha chaupat kar denge
 Will attack the theater
 aise logon main se kisi ke saath kabhi aamane-saamne takaraae?main kabhi is discshan main padataa nahin hum
 For several months, i have stopped watching TV and i am very relaxed
 ek tarah kaa shor hota he usamen
 It is as if you are doing something, actually you are not doing anything
 aapke dimag ko vaash kiya ja rahaa he
 Is a very disturbing noise
 mere to bukshelf main aap dekhenge, ek khancha he jo tivi ke liye tha, aaj tak tivi aayaa hi nahin
 Instead of watching TV, you create your own thoughts, it is a sign of your being alive
 ek abhinayta kii hameshaa ye khwaahish rahati he ki ''jo main kahuun wo jamaane kii baat ho jaey
 Now you are often successful in that endeavor, how do you see it? The responsibility of an actor is what kind of dream he makes
 maine kis khubsuurati se koun-sa kirdaar nibhaayaa, baat uski nahin he, baat ye he ki audiens meraa kirdaar dekhakar apane andar kya mahasoos karti he
 It is important for me to make people face themselves
 ruhani takat main aapkaa yakeen he? aapako lagata he ki ''koi to he jo hawaaon ke par katartaa he"?ji haa
 i also think that every man should discover his religion
 khud se kab-kab mulaakaat hoti he?actor kii basic training hi yahi hoti he ki aap apane ko padhuya shuru kar den
 Until you see the fact that you can see yourself, the actor has nothing to say till then
 he bhi to ekaadh film main khatm ho jayega
 Are you sure about method acting? This is a wrong practice
 har actor ko apana methd dhundhna padataa he
 No method has been created that applies to two actors simultaneously
 lambey samay main jaakar aapako iskaa riyaj ho paata he
 We forgot that Drama will go to school and he will teach us drama
 lagata tha ki yaar dedh saal ho gaye, ab to aa jaani chahie acting
 Our thinking has been made that you will do it and it will be found
 lekin ye vidya tabhi aati he jab iske andar aap khoj karen
 Your thinking, body and voice are your tools
 aisa bhi nahin ki is tul ko khataak se yuj karnaa shuru kar diya
 It takes riaz to use it
 mujhe hameshaa se actor main jab tak craft dikhti he, uski parformens pasand nahin aati
 Similarly, the story also surprises when it hides its crack
 mere liye kisi kairactor kaa sur dhundhna bahut jaruri he
 Not every actor is needed
 uske liye doosraa tarika ho saktaa he
 This is my method, i need a note
 samadhi, paramanand, annstaisi, kabhi iskaa ehsaas hua?yah nijee cheez he
 By telling, his energy is immersed

 Modi said that some people are 'surgical' instincts, it is very important to identify such people whose habit is to spread despair

 Actress Saif Ali Khan's actress wife Kareena Kapoor Khan gave birth to a son in December last year
 saf ne pichley saal july main karina kii pregnancy kii khabar saajha kii thi or tab se hi yah baccha surkhiyon main bana hua tha
 Saif and Kareena named the child Taimur, but perhaps they had no idea that they would face criticism from the people for the name of the child
 soshal media par bachche ke naam ko lekar kaaphi bahes hui
 Saif is not active on social media, most of the time he remains silent on the contracts but in the name of Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi, Saif has finally broken his silence
 tippaniyan Saif told Mumbai Mirror, "as far as i believe stars get a lot of privileges and our country is very balanced in terms of ideology
 log phacist or rhite wing hone kii baat karte hai or ham sabko is baat kaa dar he
 But the truth is that unnecessary drama was created about Timur
 mujhe is maamle main kuch bhi kehane kii jarurat mahasoos nahin hui kyonki kai logon ne is mudde par samajhadaari se apni baat rakhi thi
 There were many people who supported my decision and made me feel that there is nothing wrong in naming my son of his own free will
 " Saif had absolutely no intention of hurting anyone after naming his son Timur
 unhone mumbai mirar ko bataaya, 'mujhe or meri patni yah naam or iskaa matlab kaaphi pasand aayaa, main turkish akramanakari taimur ke bare main achche se jaanata hum
 My son's name is Timur, a historical Persian word meaning iron
 ' haalanki unhone mazaakia lahaze main yah bhi kaha ki shaayad bete ke naam ke saath unhen ek disclemur bhi de dena tha jaise filmon main dete hai, 'iskaa kisi bhi jivit yaa mrit vyakti se mail khaanaa maatra ek sanyog mana jayega
 ' saf ne mumbai mirar se kaha, "jahaan tak meraa maananaa he sitaron ko kaaphi privillage miltaa he or hamaara desh vichaardhaara ke maamle main kaaphi balanced he
 People talk of being fascist and right wing and we all fear this
 lekin sach yah he ki taimur ko lekar anaavashyak drama khadaa kiya gaya
 i did not feel the need to say anything in this matter because many people had given their views on this issue intelligently
 kai log the jinhone mere faisle kaa saath diya or mujhe mahasoos karaayaa ki apane bete kaa naam apni marji se rakhane main koi buraai nahin he
 " bete kaa naam taimur rakhane ke peeche saf kii manshaa kisi ko takalif pahunchane kii bilkul nahin thi
 He told Mumbai Mirror, 'I and my wife liked the name and its meaning a lot, i know the Turkish invader Timur very well
 mere bete kaa naam taimur he, jo ek aitihaasik percian shabd he jiskaa arth loha hota he
 'though he also jokingly said that perhaps he had to give a disclaimer with the son's name as he does in films,' it would be a coincidence to match any living or dead person
 ' Saif had absolutely no intention of hurting anyone after naming his son Timur
 unhone mumbai mirar ko bataaya, 'mujhe or meri patni yah naam or iskaa matlab kaaphi pasand aayaa, main turkish akramanakari taimur ke bare main achche se jaanata hum
