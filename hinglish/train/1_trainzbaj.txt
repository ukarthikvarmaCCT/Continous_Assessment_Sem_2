 Within the last 24 hours in Bihar, two cases of peak cutting and one from Uttarakhand have also been reported
 rajasthan, dilli-ensiaar, empi or upi ke baad ab bihar or uttarakhand kaa naam bhi in ghatnaon se jude rajyon kii fehrist main shaamil ho gaya he
 The first incident is from Motihari district of Bihar
 radhika naamak ladki beeti raat ghar ke baahar so rahi thi
 Meanwhile, his top was mysteriously cut
 subah radhika ne apni chotii kati hui dekhi orshor machaanashuru kiya
 Radhika's family and the entire village are in panic after this incident
 duusari ghatana mujffarpur jile main hui, jahaan ek bujurg mahila raat ko apane ghar ke angan main so rahi thi
 Like the first incident, the peak of the elderly woman was also cut at night
 subah uthne ke baad bujurg mahila ne apane parivaar ko is bare main bataaya
 The woman's family has been in awe since the incident
 uttarakhand ke sahaspur main bhi farjaana naam kii ek ladki kii chotii katane kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 Hearing Farzana's scream at around 12 last night, the eyes of the family members were opened
 parijan farjaana ke paas pahunche to dekha ki uski kati hui chotii bistar par hi padi thi
 Farzana is very scared of this incident
 shanivaar ko ek baar phir dilli sechoti kaatejane kii do khabaren ain hai
 Last night in Chander Vihar, a woman named Neeraj fainted after a severe headache
 subah jab use hosh aayaa to uski chotii kati hui thi
 At the same time, a 13-year-old girl in Jamia Nagar area also lost her peak last night
 bihar kii rajdhani patna ke aitihaasik gandhi maidan main congress kii prastaavit jan aakanksha raily ke maddenjar party ke road sho main bahubali nirdaleey vidhayak anant singh ke shaamil hone ke kai siyaasi myne nikaale ja rahe hai
 When the rjd-jdu-congress alliance contested during the Bihar assembly elections, RJD chief Lalu Yadav forced Anant Singh to quit the JDU, making the bullying and violence an issue
 aise main loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle unka congress ke kaarykram main khulkar shaamil hone se bihar main prastaavit mahagathbandhan kii ganth dhili pad sakati he
 Anant Singh, who attended the roadshow of the Congress, was seen in the road show organized by Patna Congress Committee in Patna along with the President of the State Congress Election Committee and Rajya Sabha member Akhilesh Prasad Singh in his vehicle
 darasal mokama se nirdaleey vidhayak anant singh muger loksabhaa seat se chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai or ve congress ke tikat par chunavi maidan main utarane kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 It is believed that from here, another Bahubali and former MP from Bihar Surajbhan Singh can hit the electoral table on the ticket of LJP
 bataa den ki surajbhaan or anant singh ek duusare ke dhur virdohi maane jate hai
 However, Bihar Congress President Madan Mohan Jha said on joining Anant Singh in the road show of the Congress that there is no objection if any person expresses faith in the leadership of party president Rahul Gandhi
 lekin jahaan tak party main shaamil hone or tikat kaa sawaal he to iskaa nirnay alaakaman karegaa
 At the same time, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has already said that there is no place for Anant Singh in the grand alliance
 anya dabang bhi congress ke sampark menhaal hi main bihar ke dabang anand mohan kii patni lavali anand congress party main shaamil hui hai
 Apart from this, LJP MP from Vaishali and Dabang Rama Singh are also said to be in contact with the Congress
 vahiin madhepura se saansad pappu yadav bhi lagaataar congress ke sampark main bane hue hai
 While his wife Ranjita Ranjan is already a Congress MP
 argedy kisi bhi kimat par pappu yadav ko gathbandhan main jagah nahin dena chaahati
 Anyway, in the face of the alliance, Sharad Yadav should be contested from rjd's Madhepura seat from where he has been contesting till now
 pappu yadav dabang chhavi ke netaa hai or argedy pramukh lalu yadav ke virdohi hai
 Standing congress-rjd on upper caste reservation, RJD and Congress are worried about each other's stand if they look at the developments of the last few days
 sansad main saamaanya jati ke garibon ko 10 fisadi aarakshan ke mudde par argedy ne khulkar virodh kiya
 But the Congress supported the bill in both houses
 vahiin uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party ke gathbandhan ke elaan ke baad argedy netaa tejasvi yadav ne swayan akhilesh yadav or mayawati se mulaakaat kii
 According to the Congress' observations on the upper caste vote, the Congress party in Bihar is throwing all its strength to vote for the upper castes in its favor
 mana ja rahaa he ki loksabhaa chunaav se purv kai savarna netaa congress main shaamil ho sakate hai
 Apart from Bihar's Bahubali leaders, other names are discussed, former BJP MP from Purnia, Uday Singh and Darbhanga MP Kirti Azad are also in touch with Congress
 bataa den ki lambey samay se bijepi se naaraaz chal rahe purv saansad udai singh ne haal hi main party kii praathmik sadsyta se istipha diya he
 It is believed that Uday Singh may attend Congress President Rahul Gandhi's rally in Patna on 3 January
 to vahiin kirti aaazaad kii patni punam jha aaazaad pehle hi congress party main shaamil ho chuki hai
 There is no consensus on the seats now that the sharing of seats between the parties of the Grand Alliance has not yet been done in Bihar
 pichhali baar bihar kii 40 siton main se 27 seat par argedy, 12 par congress or 1 seat par ensipi chunaav ladi thi
 But this time the alliance includes RJD and RLSP of Upendra Kushwaha, Mukesh Sahni's party Nishad Vikas Sangh, Jitan Ram Manjhi's party Hindustan Awam Morcha, Left and Sharad Yadav's party
 sutron ke mutabik argedy 20 siton par chunaav ladanaa chaahati he or baaki kii siton par congress or anya sahyogi dalon ke chhodane ko taiyaar he
 In such a situation, the seats given to the Congress can be reduced only due to the involvement of more allies
 gujarat ne ranjai trophy ke final mukaable ke paanchaven evam antim din shanivaar ko maujuuda vijeta mumbai ko paanch wicket se maat dete hue pehali baar khitaab par kabja jamaaya he
 Gujarat needed 312 runs in the fourth innings to win
 captain parthiv patel (143) kii aguai main gujarat ne 89
 Losing five wickets in 5 overs, achieved this historic victory by achieving this goal
 gujarat isse pehle 1950-51 main ranjai trophy ke final main pahunchaa tha
 Gujarat lost to the Holkar cricket team in the final for the first time and coincidentally see that they won this time at Holkar Stadium
 parthiv ke alaava manpreet juneja ne bhi 54 ranon kaa ahm yogadan diya
 Parthiv, playing his final for the 46th time, was bowled out for Mumbai's first innings by 228 runs
 iske baad gujarat ne parthiv (90) or manpreet (77) kii pariyon kii madad se apni pehali pari main 328 ran banaate hue 100 ranon kii badhat le lee thi
 Mumbai had scored a target of 312 runs in front of Gujarat, scoring 411 runs in the second innings
 chiraag gandhi (naabad 11) ne team ke liye vijayi shot lagaaya
 Rujul Bhatt returned unbeaten after scoring 27 runs with Gandhi
 cabinet main pherbadal ko lekar congress ne modi sarkaar par karaara hamalaa bolaa he
 Congress leader Mallikarjan Kharge said that whether they are preparing for the year 2019 or 2022, they should know that they do not give power to the ministers
 sari chijen piemo or uske adhikari hi chalaate hai
 The officers of the Ministry report directly to them
 mantri ke paas power hi nahin
 The PMO has all the power, so what is the benefit of the change in the cabinet? Kharge, a Congress leader in the Lok Sabha, said that the BJP is not working for the people by trusting its people
 sadak ko chhod dijie to baaki jagahon or yojanaon main bhedbhaav bartaa ja rahaa he
 The government is being used to increase bjp's base
 baadh ke ilaakon main raahat kaaryon main virdohi dalon kii sarkaron or saansadon kii nahin suni jaati he
 Preference is given to BJP ruled states and their mps
 congress netaa ne kaha kipiemne railmantri ko badla ye unka adhikaar, lekin jab mantri ko power hi nahin to badalane se kya hoga?mantriyonko har chiz ke liye piemo kii taraf dekhnaa hota he
 What is the use of this? Our party leader Manish Tiwari has already reacted to Anant Hegde
 khadge ne kaha kicabinetka matlab modi hai
 
 
 There is no discussion
 
 
 naa prastaav hota he
 Which Modi speaks
 
 
 vahi hota he, jo bolaa jaataa he wo kar dete hai
 Only at the behest of the PMO does the ministry seal it
 new india or purana india ye sab jumledaar baaten hai
 India is not made in a day
 congress ne banaaya he
 The settlement settles, not in a day
 unhone kaha ki modi svachh bharat, notebandi, berojgaare samet tamaam maamalon main fail hai or baaten new india kii karte hai
 a standing committee of Parliament has asked the Railways why it is operating luxury trains with only 30 per cent booking

 The report comes at a time when Railway Board Chairman Ashwani Lohani has held the first discussion session with stakeholders on trade and travel
 railway keeis pahal kamakasad railway ke madhyam se paryaton ko protsaahan dena he
 The report has been criticized by the Railway Ministry, saying that the committee has criticized the Railway Ministry for not taking seriously the issue of shortage of passengers in luxury trains
 samiti ne kaha he ki mantralay ko isaki uchit tareeke se samiksha ke baad bataanaa chahie ki aisi trainen sirf 30 pratishat yatriyon ke saath kyon chalaai ja rahi hai

 Usually in a mosque, there are male imams, proclaiming, offering prayers
 lekin denmark kii rajdhani copenhegan main ek aisi masjid bani he jahaan ye sab kaam mahilaayein karengi
 This mosque has been started by a woman named Sherin Khankan
 sherin ke pita syrian muslim hai vahiin maa isaai hai
 This mosque is named Maryam

 However, apart from this, women and men can take an equal part in every activity of the mosque

 Sherin is a well-known writer in Denmark
 sherin kaa maananaa he ki islam hi nahin balki yahudee, isaai or anya dharmon ke sansthaanon main bhi pitrusattatmakataa maujuud he
 It is necessary to take such steps to overcome it
 denmark main pehali baar mahilaon ke netritv walemasjidki shuruyaat hui he

 Delhi Metro Grey Line: najafagarh ke shahari gramin ilaake ko pehali baar dilli metro (delhi Metro) se jodne vaali 4
 Services on the 2-km long Gray Line will begin for passengers from Friday evening
 dilli metro (delhi Metro) ke adhikariyon ke anusaar is coridor main teen stesan- dwarka (blue line ke saath interchange), nangali or najafagarh hai
 The dwarka-najafgarh Corridor of the Delhi Metro was formally flagged off by Minister of State (independent Charge) for Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today
 dilli metro rail corporation ke kaaryakari nideshak anuj dayaal ne bataaya ki grey line ko metro bhawan main subah hari jhandi dikhaakar shuruyaat kii
 Passenger service on this line will start from 5 pm on 4 October
 is line ke shuru hone se dilli metro kaa network 274 steshnon ke saath 377 kilometre tak bad jayega, jisamen noida-greater noida ekua line bhi shaamil he
 Anuj Dayal earlier stated that the gray line is the standard gauge section and has 4
 295 kilometre main se 2
 57 km way up and 1

 With the start of this line, interchange facility will be available from Dwarka metro station

 So what was the trouble by then by London? The world's biggest news of technology two days ago was 'google's ban on Huawei'
 google ne yah karrwai is chini company ko america prashasan kii ore se us kaali suchi main daale jane ke baad kii he jisamen shaamil companiyon ko america companiyon ke hardware yaa software niryaat par pratibandh lagaaya gaya he
 However, phones that already have these hardware or software will continue to run and will also get updates
 intel, kwalkom or earem jaisi duusari kapaniyon ne bhi huavei ko aapurti roak di he
 US sanctions (later deferred for 90 days) are a result of concerns that Huawei's close proximity to the Chinese government is expected to use its equipment in espionage
 huavei ne aaropon kaa khandan kiya he
 Nevertheless, the ban could completely eliminate Huawei
 uske saamne ab keval shuruaati open-sorce android istemaal karne kaa vikalp he jiske saath play store, google maps, you-tub yaa mail ke ap kaam nahin karenge
 Huawei was also developing its app gallery from 2018, but those apps are not very useful for India or the rest of the world
 is pratibandh se google ko bhi license or anya shulkon ke rup main lagbhag 40 karod dollar salanaa kaa nuksaan hoga
 1 on fraud charges in the European Union
 7 arab dollar kaa jurmaana bharne vaali lagbhag 100 arab dollar kii company google ke liye yah koi bada nuksaan nahin he
 Nevertheless, this could pose major threats to Google and the US
 pehali baat yah ki asian smartphone nirmaataa bazaar par google ke kabje se chintit hai
 75 percent of all smartphones around the world are Android-based and makes it difficult for these manufacturers to be prepared for the blitzkrieg Donald Trump's trade-war missile-like attacks
 huavei koi choti machhlee nahin he
 In 2018, it overtook Apple as the number two smartphone maker after Samsung, exporting around 200 million smartphones
 roak ke baad apple phir duusare sthaan par hogi
 Secondly, the Chinese Empire will also counter-attack
 china aupchaarik rup se apple par pratibandh laga saktaa he
 However, Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zangfei has said that they will oppose such a situation as Apple is their mentor, Apple is being informally boycotted in China and many Chinese customers are calling their Apple phones Chinese manufacturers
 Changing from 's phone
 huavei par roak kaa bharat par bhi asar hoga jiske smartphone bazaar par android kaa raaj he
 At the beginning of the year, Huawei announced a localized construction plan for India with an investment of $ 100 million over the next three years
 huavei kaa doorsanchaar upkaran kaarobaar bhi daanv par he
 The US has been pressurizing other countries to ban Huawei's devices
 japan or australia roak laga bhi chuke hai
 In this field, Huawei has to compete with Europe's Nokia and Ericsson besides ZTE
 donon europea companiyaan bhi china se upkarnon ke purjon kaa aayaat karti hai
 Indian officials believe that there is no need to separate Huawei from others
 germany or britain ne america dabaav kaa virodh kiya he
 The Indian telecom secretary said in September that Huawei may not be invited to test 5G technology
 phir bhi bharat huavei ke banaae upkarnon kaa prayog jari rakhega
 India should be careful in this fight
 bharat apane sangrakshanvaadi ravaiye kii parakh main laga he: storage or bhugtan se sambandhit data kii processing desh main anivaary kii gai he
 India imports about 90 percent of telecom network equipment — routers, base stations, antennas and multiplexers — about $ 22 billion (2017-18)
 doorsanchaar niamak praadhikaran kaa kahana he ki aise 'ranneetik mahatv' vaale upkarnon kaa nirmaan bharat ko khud karnaa chahie
 In 1994, a statement was made by the founder of Huawei in which he said that telecom equipment is related to national security and without it a nation is like it does not have its own army
 vahi bayaan ab unki mushkil badha saktaa he

 According to the expert committee of the commission, these video ads were against the spirit of the code of conduct

 bataa den, rafel deal ko lekar rahul gandhi lagaataar hamalavar hai
 Rahul is alleged to have been involved in the deal and PM Modi is involved in it

 The woman first put her intoxicated in a drink and put her husband to death and then cut his body into 8 pieces
 mahila yaheen nahin rukii, usne pati ke kate hue sir ko ghar ke paas hi ek naale main phenk diya
 While the rest of the corpses were buried in his house by digging a pit
 katl kii ye khaufnak kahani vailemtine de ke din likhi gai thi
 In fact, in 2006, 50-year-old Rajesh, who lived in northwest Delhi, was married to Sunita, half his age, 25 years
 shaadi ke ek saal baad hi unke ghar main ek bete kaa janm hua
 Till then everything was fine
 lekin asli pareshaani tab shuru hui, jab unka parivaar pichley saal ek nae ghar main shift hua
 There Sunita became friends with a boy living in the neighborhood
 rajesh ne ek baar apni patni ko ladke ke saath aapattijanak haalat main dekh liya tha
 Apart from this, another incident happened which made the situation worse
 sunita kii maa kuch samay pehle hi unke ghar ai thi, jinhen rajesh pasand nahin karata tha
 He went to leave the station to Sunita's mother but she did not reach home
 sunita ko laga ki rajesh ne uski maa kii hatya kar di he
 When all the ways to save this relationship were closed, he started watching crime serials day and night
 wo apane pati se chhutkaaraa paane ke upaay khojane lagi
 And after this Sunita hatched a creepy conspiracy
 jise usne vailemtine de ke din sunita ne apane khatarnaak mansoobon ko anjaam diya
 Sunita added a large amount of painkillers to her husband's drink, which led to Rajesh's death
 iske baad usne rajesh kii laash ko tukdon main kaatna shuru kiya
 In two hours, he cut the corpse into 8 pieces
 phir usne apane ghar ke baahar khaali jagah main ek gaddha khoda or usamen laash ke baaki bache tukade dafna die or uskaa sir ko ek plastic bag main bharkar bhalswa dairy ke paas naale main phenk ai
 While the corpse was buried at another place by digging a pit
 phir ghar waapas aakar usne khun saaf kiya or katl ke saboot mitaae
 According to the plan, Sunita reached the police station two days later and lodged a report of her husband's disappearance
 kuch samay tak padosiyon ne bhi rajesh ke bare main poocha, phir ve bhi shant ho gaye
 Shortly after this incident, the police recovered a rotten head
 jisase police alert ho gai
 The twist in the story came last week
 jab unka makaan maalik sunita ke ghar aayaa or vahaan marammat ke kaam ko dekhakar poochtacha kii
 But Sunita could not give a satisfactory answer to this
 kuch der baad makaan maalik lautakar waapas aayaa or jahaan ret or masala laga tha
 Looked at him
 usamen se nikali anguliyaan dekhakar vah hakkaa-bakka rah gaya gaya
 After this, he removed the sand more and then the whole hand was visible makaan maalik ne tatkaal police ko soochna di
 Police reached the spot with a forensic team
 police ko rajesh kii patni sunita par shaq hua
 So he was strictly questioned
 isi dauraan sunita tut gai
 He confessed his crime to the police
 sunita ne police ko bataaya ki ek saal se unke bich koi relation nahin tha
 The matter had reached divorce
 pati kaa gusse or marpet se tang aakar usne hatya kii vaardaat ko anjaam diya
 At present, the police have sent Sunita to jail
 jabaki unke bete ko bal grih main rakhaa gaya he
 Indian weightlifters were again embroiled in a doping controversy when 53 kg weightlifter Sanamacha Chanu was found positive in the NADA dope test held last month
 bharat kuch samay pehle hi antarashtriya pratibandh se bachaa he jiske kaaran vah rashtramandal khelon main bhaag lene se bhi vanchit ko saktaa tha
 Chanu, one of the country's most successful women weight lifters, has been found positive for the banned substance methylhexaniamine, his second offense after being caught in the 2004 Athens Olympics
 ab agar chanu kaa ‘bi’ namoona bhi pajitive paaya jaataa he or vah nadaa apili panel ke samaksh khud ko nirdosh sabit karne main vifal rahati he to un par aaajeevan pratibandh lag saktaa he
 East Asian and 2002 Manchester Commonwealth Games champion Chanu has been found positive in the trials held during the Delhi Commonwealth Games trial last month here
 ek sheersh sutara ne kaha, ‘haa, chanu mithailhexaniamine ke liye pajitive pai gai hai
 It is up to them to test the 'B' sample and appear before the appeal panel of NADA
 ’ bhartiya bharottolan mahasang ke sachiv sahadev yadav ne kaha ki ek bharottolak pratibandhit padaarth ke liye pajitive paaya gaya he lekin yah pichley maheene ghoshit rashtramandal khelon kii team main shaamil nahin he
 Yadav said, 'A weight lifter has been found positive but we cannot disclose the name until the result of the' b 'sample, which rules the rules
 ‘bi’ namoonay kaa nateeja somvaar tak aane kii ummid he
 But i can say that this weightlifter is not in the Commonwealth Games team
 ’ bhartiya bharottolak sangh ne pichley saal sitambar main wada ke dope test main chah bharottolkon ke funsane par haal hi main antarrashtriya sanstha ko paanch lakh dollars kaa jurmaana bharaa tha
 The weightlifters of the country got approval to participate in the Commonwealth Games next month only when the Commonwealth Organizing Committee gave the Indian Weightlifting Association 1
 75 karod rupee kaa byaaj mukt rin diya jisase usne 31 agast tak paanch lakh dollars jurmaane kii baaki do kishton kaa bhugtan kiya
 This Manipur athlete has also been found positive for the same methylhexaniamine which has been at the center of controversy for some time as 11 athletes have been found positive for the same substance in the past week
 yah padaarth food supplement main maujuud hota he
 Chanu was also found positive for Duretic during the 2004 Athens Games
 pratimaa kumari (63 kigra) bhi doping kii doshi pai gai or in donon par do saal kaa pratibandh jabaki bhartiya bharottolan mahasang par ek saal kaa pratibandh laga
 India has expressed deep concern over the bail of 26 / 11 prime accused zaki-ur-rehman Lakhvi
 videsh mantralay ne kaha ki isse aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladane kii pakistan kii patibaddhta kaa majaak banataa he
 Ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said on Friday, the bail granted to Lakhvi would make fun of Pakistan's commitment to fight against the terrorist organization
 televijan channel ke samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main pravaktaa ne kaha ki mumbai hamale par pakistan kii jaanch bahut dhimi raftaar se aage bad rahi he or lakhvi ko guuruuvaar ko di gai jamaanat se isamen aisi hi ek or kadi jud gai he
 "despite many assurances, we have seen a slow pace of trial against all the seven accused in the anti-terrorism court and the ongoing investigation against the conspiracy of Mumbai attack," he said
 lagaataar nilamban, sthagan or sambandhit kanoonee adhikariyon va gavaahon kii anuplabadhata iskaa pramaan he or ise baar-baar kehane kii jarurat nahin he
 He said, giving bail to Lakhvi on Thursday has taken the matter further
 hamane is maamle par apni chintaa jataai he or bharat kii is bhaavana se pakistan ko avgat karaayaa he ki yah aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladane kii pakistan kii patibaddhta kaa majaak bana degaa
 An Islamabad court on Thursday granted bail to Lakhvi, who is accused of 26 / 11 attack along with seven others
 is ghatana main 166 logon kii maut ho gai thi or kai anya ghayal hue the
 Lakhvi is believed to be the head of operations of the banned organization let at the time of the attack
 kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh ne guuruuvaar ko lakhvi ko mili jamaanat par pratikriya dete hue kaha tha, yah durbhagyapurna he or main maanata hum ki yah nahin hona chahie tha
 He said that the Government of Pakistan should appeal to the High Court
 videsh mantralay ne bhi kadi pratikriya jaahir karte hue kaha ki lakhvi ko jamaanat nrushans aparaadh karne vaale aatankwaadiyon ko batch nikalne kaa bharosa dilaane jaisaa he
 The ministry demanded Pakistan to take immediate steps against this anti-terrorism court ruling
 isane kaha, pakistan main haal ke dinon main hue hamale ke paimaane ko dekhte hue, ise yah ahsaas karana uchit he ki aatankwaadiyon ke saath kisi tarah kaa samjhauta nahin ho saktaa

 (input: IANS) (input: IANS) a program called "sanjhi" was organized at Sardar Patel Vidyalaya on Friday
 yah mahaj isi skool ke chaatro ke liye nahin balki dilli-ensiaar ke kai skulon ke chaatro kaa maano samagam tha
 The event was organized to inculcate cultural understanding among children from different corners of the country
 isamen 23 skulon ke vidhyaarthiyon ne hissaa liya
 The 'sanjhi' program consisted of three types of things
 masalan teen category thim art, story teling or mujeec jisamen bacchon ne hissaa liya
 The program took place simultaneously at three different places on the school campus
 kahin art, kahin story teling to kahin mujeec
 Assam, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Kashmir, Bihar
 
 Not only this, the children showed the specialty of all the places in the country through acting
 tippaniyan Story telling was only for 8-10 year olds
 baaki donon category main 11 se 18 saal ke bich ke bacchon ne samaa baandha
 There is no competition here, but India showed unity in diversity
 sardaar patel vidhyalay kii english kii teacher anumita bhaatia ne bataaya ki yah chauthaa saal he jab 'sanjhi' kaa aayojan hua
 In the beginning there were only 10–11 schools
 par har saal isamen skulon kii sankhya main izaafaa ho rahaa he
 Children from schools such as Springdales, Sadhu Vaswani, ITL, ahlcon, Vasant Valley, bluebells worked to learn and teach through art, music and story telling
 'sanjhi' kaarykram ke tahat teen tarah kii chizon kaa samavesh tha
 For example, there were three categories of art, storytelling and music in which children participated
 skool ke campus main hi alag-alag teen jagahon par ek saath hi yah kaarykram hua
 Art somewhere, storytelling somewhere, music somewhere
 assam, pashchim bengal, rajasthan, kashmir, bihar
 
 itnaa hi nahin desh kii tamaam jagahon kii khaasiyat ko bacchon ne abhinay ke jariye dikhaaya
 The comments story teling 8-10 saal ke bacchon ke liye hi tha
 In the other two categories, children between 11 and 18 years of age tied up
 yahaan koi pratiyogita nahin balki anekta main ekta kaa bharat desh dikhaa
 English teacher of Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, Anumita Bhatia said that this is the fourth year when 'sanjhi' was organized
 shuruyaat main mahaj 10-11 skool hote the
 But every year the number of schools in it is increasing

 If the 38-year-old Sachin Tendulkar, the evergreen Virender Sehwag and the 22-year-old Virat Kohli are left out, the IPL performance seems to have had the effect of fatigue on Mahendra Singh Dhoni and some of his teammates from the world champions playing cricket
 Is thought
 dhoni pehle hi bhartiya cricket team ke vyast kaarykram se khafa the or unhone kaha tha ki iskaa asar khilaadiyon ke pradarshan par pad saktaa he
 Now seeing the performance of many players in the IPL, it seems that fatigue is prevailing on them even before the tour of West Indies
 ipel 28 may ko samaapt hoga or bhartiya team 1 june ko westeindies ravaanaa ho jaaegi, jahaan use 4 june se ek twanti-20, paanch vanade or teen test match khilne hai
 Indian players have not been rested for the last five months and so some senior players may be rested in the Caribbean tour
 tendulkar, kohli, sahvaag or kuch had tak yuvaraj singh or gautam gambhir ko chhod diya jaae, to captain dhoni, suresh raina, big heater yusuf pathan, tej gendbaaj jahir khan or srisanth tathaa spinner harbhajan singh or piyush chawla jaise vishwa champion team ke sadsy ipel main ab tak apekshanuroop pradarshan nahin kar paae hai
 Tendulkar performed strongly in the IPL by beating age and busyness again, and for the most part of this Twenty20 tournament, he was wearing the orange cap, the most scoring batsman for most of the time
 tendulkar ne ab tak saat match main 276 ran banaae hai, jisamen ek shatak or ek ardhashatak shaamil he
 Dhoni recently said, you can deal with the physical aspect, but the amount of cricket being played can weaken your mental and emotional state
 bharat kii vishwa cap jeet ke nayak rahe yuvaraj singh ne bhi unka samarthan kiya tha, lekin sahvaag apane captain se sahamat nahin the
 Looking at the performance in the IPL that began six days after the World Cup, it seems that Dhoni is not really dominating cricket fatigue
 dhoni ne pehle 7 match main keval 137 ran banaae, jisamen unka ucchtam score 43 ran rahaa
 His teammate Raina also played the same number of matches in which he has 153 runs in his name
 ipel main sarvaadhik ran banane kaa ricard raina ke naam par he, lekin yah uplabdhi vah pehle teen toornament main achche pradarshan ke dam par hasil kar paae hai
 In the World Cup, Yuvraj had done wonders with both bat and ball
 ipel main bhi unhone apni vahi farm barkaraar rakhane kii koshish kii he, lekin lagata he ki un par duusari taraf se sahyog nahin milane kaa dabaav he, jisase vah pehle 7 match main 232 ran hi bana paae or keval 4 wicket hi hasil kar sake
 He took these four wickets in a match against Delhi
 yadi gendbaajon kii baat kii jaae to bengalooru ko apane mukhya gendbaaj jahir se khaasi niraashaa hui he, jo 7 match main keval 7 wicket le paae hai
 He took three of these wickets in a match against Deccan Chargers
 unka 7 / 27 kaa iconomi rate bhi prabhaavshaalee nahin he
 Harbhajan had high expectations from the Mumbai Indians, but he has taken 7 wickets in 6 matches and the important thing is that he took 5 wickets for 18 runs in the match played against Chennai in Mumbai
 baaki 5 match main vah keval do wicket nikaal paae
 Munaf Patel of Mumbai and r Ashwin of Chennai Super Kings have achieved success at the rate of one wicket per match by playing 7-7 matches
 es srisanth ne dilli ke khilaaf karishmai pradarshan kiya, lekin isse pehle unhone jo 3 match khele the, unamem unhone keval 1 wicket liya tha
 In this way, he now has 3 wickets in 4 matches to his name

 unnav rape cond kii peedita kii chachee or mausi kii maut pichley 18 saalon main uske parivaar main chauthi aisi maut he, jiskaa iljaam vidhayak kuldeep senger par ungali uthaa rahaa he
 Earlier, the MLA was also held responsible for the death of the victim's tau and then the victim's father
 yahaan tak ki peedit ke chachaa ko hatya kii koshish ke mukademe main fansaane ke liye bhi parivaar ne vidhayak ko gunahagaar tehraaya
 Let us tell you how the story of rivalry started between the victim's family and MLA 18 years ago? This story starts from Makhi village in Unnao district
 makhi gaanv ke sarai thok mohalla main aaropee vidhayak kuldeep singh senger or peedit ladki kaa ghar he
 There is a gap of about twenty steps between the two houses
 or dushmani kaa yah kissa lagbhag 18 saal purana he
 Three brothers used to live in Sarai Thok Mohle village of Sayamakhi village of the victim's family
 guddu singh, mahesh singh or pappu singh
 The three brothers were known as Dabangg in the area
 in par kai alag-alag mukademe bhi darj the
 Guddu Singh was the tau of the raped girl
 kareeb 15 saal pehle guddu singh kii gaanv main hi logon ne peet-peet kar hatya kar di thi
 Mahesh Singh is the victim's uncle, who is currently lodged in Rae Bareli jail
 usee se milane ke liye ravivaar ko peedita jail ja rahi thi
 While Pappu Singh was the victim's father
 jinaki vidhayak ke bhai or uske gurgon ke haathon pitayee ke baad 2017 main maut ho gai thi
 That is, both the tau and father of the victim girl have been killed
 jabaki peedita kaa chachaa hatya kii koshish ke ek maamle main raibareli kii jail main das saal kii sajaa kaat rahaa he
 And the same uncle's wife and sister-in-law have also died in the same road accident, about which many doubts and questions are arising
 ab yahaan jo sabase ahm baat he wo ye ki ek taaoo guddu singh kii maut ko chhod den to baaki har maut or chachaa ke jail jane ko lekar sidhe ungali vidhayak kuldeep singh senger kii taraf uth rahi he
 Even the charge of rape is the same
 or ab is sadak haadase kaa shaq usee par ja rahaa he
 But why? Why did an entire family disintegrate in about a decade and a half? Is there any old rivalry between the rape victim's girl and the mla's family? If yes, then what is the story? tab se pehle tak kuldeep singh senger or peedit ladki ke taaoo, chachaa or pita se kuldeep singh senger kii khub banati thi
 Both were to come to each other's house
 khaanaa-pinaa tha
 In 2002, when Kuldeep Singh Sengar was contesting the assembly for the first time, the victim's tau, uncle and father helped the Sengar to win the election
 magar pehali baar vidhayak banane ke baad kuldeep singh senger ne achaanak teenon bhaaiyon se kinaaraa karnaa shuru kar diya
 After this, a rift started between the two families
 dhire-dhire ye daraar aapasi ranjish main badal gai
 Meanwhile, the election of village head has come
 tab senger ko sabak sikhaane ke liye peedit ladki ke taaoo guddu singh ne khud pradhani kaa chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya
 On the other hand, Chunni Devi, mother of legislator Sengar, was contesting for Pradhani
 tab pehali baar tha, jab donon parivaar aamane-saamne the
 However, just before the election, Kuldeep Singh Sengar rejected the candidature of Guddu Singh by arming him
 lihaaza ab guddu singh kii jagah uske kareebi devendra singh kii maa ko chunaav main utaar diya gaya
 During this election campaign, the victim girl clashed between uncle Mahesh Singh and Sengar and his bikers
 goli bhi chali
 In which many people were injured
 baad main vidhayak senger kii taraf se police ne mahesh singh ke khilaaf hatya kii koshish kaa maamla darj kiya
 Meanwhile, the first murder in the mutual enmity between these two families was that of Tau Guddu Singh of the victim
 gaanv main hi kuch logon ne eent-pattharon se hamalaa kare use maar diya tha
 Guddu's family was accused of plotting to assassinate him, then MLA Kuldeep Sengar
 guddu singh kii maut ke fouran baad peedit ladki kaa chachaa mahesh unnav chhod kar gaayab ho gaya
 Then after nearly 17 years in 2018, he was caught close to Delhi and now in the same case he is serving a ten-year sentence in Rae Bareli jail
 4 june 2017 ko 17 varshiya peedita ne ilzaam lagaaya ki vidhayak senger ne apane ghar par uski asmat luti
 After this charge, Atul Singh, brother of MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and his associates handed over the victim's father Pappu Singh to the police after beating him badly
 tab pita pappu singh ne kaha bhi tha ki unhen farji maamle main fansaaya ja rahaa he
 But the police still filed an Arms Act case and sent Pappu Singh to jail
 jahaan do din baad hi unki maut ho gai
 This was the second death in a feud between the two families
 or ab peedit parivaar ke parivaar main do or maut ho gai
 One aunt and the other aunt's sister
 chachee bhi is maamle main vidhayak senger ke khilaaf ahm gavaah thim
 While the condition of the victim girl remains critical
 zaahir he maamla sirf rape tak nahin he
 Rather, it is a case of the destruction of a whole family and its destruction
 is cese kii jad main he wo shaks jise vidhayak kuldeep singh senger kehete hai

 Jaunpur district administration of Uttar Pradesh has issued a strict order to recover more than seven hundred crore dues on electricity consumers
 ab ek oktober se bijli bill bhugtan kii raseed dikhaane par hi sarkari suvidhaon kaa laabh mil sakegaa
 Even orders have been issued to the Kotdars that ration should be given to the one who shows the receipt for depositing the electricity bill
 haalanki is aadesh par sawaal bhi uthne lage hai
 It is being said that instead of recovering the huge dues of government departments, the administration is busy whipping people only
 jonpur se pehle gorakhpur jile ke dm aisa aadesh nikaal chuke hai
 DM Jaunpur has said in an order issued on September 18 that electricity consumers do not pay the bills on time
 chunki uttar pradesh power karporation limited kii ore se letters of credit ke jariye vidyut utpaadan nigam se bijli kii kharid hoti he
 Due to this, the department has a cash problem
 dhan kii kami se bijli kharid na hone par apatkaaleen katautee hoti he
 Due to this, it has been decided that the applicant will also have to present the electricity bill payment receipt while submitting the application for services to the general public from the public utility centers, tehsils, collectorate and various departments operated by the state government from October 1
 That he or the family member has paid
 bataaya jaataa he ki is tarah kaa aadesh gorakhpur jila prashasan bhi nikaal chukaa he
 dms of districts are making efforts from their respective levels after the government has tightened the payment of outstanding bills

 bijepi ke khilaaf yah shivasena kaa bada kadam bataaya ja rahaa he kyonki hardik patel bijepi ko dushman number ek bataate hai to shivasena ke rishte bhi party ke saath thik nahin chal rahe hai
 On the one hand, the BMC elections in Maharashtra and the Gujarat assembly elections in December on the other, Shiv Sena has befriended Patidar leader Hardik Patel just before that

 In a joint press conference after meeting Hardik Patel on Tuesday, Uddhav Thackeray told the Maharashtra government on notice that the government was running with the support of the Shiv Sena
 2
 Patidar leaders Hardik Patel are continuously opposing BJP with the demand for reservation
 haal hi main hardik kii gujarat main vaapasi hui he, unhen gujarat hai court ne 6 maheenon ke liye rajya se baahar rahane kaa aadesh diya tha
 3
 patidaar andolan ke chalate hi anandiben patel ko gujarat kii siem pad se istipha dena padaa tha
 After him Vijay Rupani took command of the state
 hardik patel ne saaf kiya he ki agar patidaaron ko aarakshan nahin diya gaya, to ve ladakar apana haq lenge
 4
 beete varsh gujarat main daliton par hue hamalon ko dekhte hue kai dalit netaaon ne bhi hardik patel kaa saath diya
 In such a situation, with the support of Shiv Sena, Hardik Patel can make it difficult for BJP by joining the Patidars and Dalits
 5
 Gujarat is considered a stronghold of PM Modi and BJP and if Hardik Patel gets huge public support, it can become a challenge for the party to retain its hold in the state
 6

 It may be known that in 1999, Chintaman Onega of BJP defeated DM Shingda of Congress in Dahanu Lok Sabha seat
 uske baad se dahanu main bijepi kaa dabadabaa badha
 But after delimitation, three assembly seats in BJP dominated Jawahar, Dahanu and Igatpuri Bhiwandi Lok Sabha

 iske baad emje akbar ne patrkaar priya ramani ke khilaaf dilli ke patiala house court main manahani kaa mukadmaa daayar kiya tha

 unhone court main daayar apane mukademe main kaha ki priya ramani dwaara lagaae gaye yon shoshan ke aarope bebuniyaad hai
 In this case of defamation, all the witnesses on behalf of MJ Akbar have recorded their statements in the court
 lihaaja ab priya ramani ke khilaaf manahani ke cese main paryaapt saboot hai yaa nahin
 
 
 
 
 This court has to decide
 agar court ko lagata he ki priya ramani ke khilaaf is maamle main paryaapt saboot hai, to phir court priya ramani ko saman bhejega
 After this, a trial will be conducted on Ramani in this case and if no evidence is found, then the court will end the case here, giving its verdict
 centre kii modi sarkaar main rajya mantri rahe emje akbar aise pehle shaks hai, jinako yon shoshan ke aaropon kaa saamana karte hue apni kursi ganvaani padi he
 So this case of defamation is very important for MJ Akbar

 In fact, in the five state assembly elections the walls have grown so much that most parties and leaders have been forced to seek the help of professional spies to find the difference between themselves and the strangers
 is khufiagiri kii khaasiyat yah he ki netaa virodhiyon se zyada apane ird-gird maujuud logon kii jasusi kara rahe hai
 While on the one hand they are seeking the help of spies to make their way easier, on the other hand, the parties have relied on intelligence to select the right candidate
 chunaav main apane jasoos bhej rahi dilli kii eemex detectivaj ke sanchaalak baldev kumaar puri kaa kahana he, ''chunaav prachaar shuru hone se kahin pehle party alaakaman ne daavedaaron ke panel main se sahi pratyaashee chhaantane main detective agency kii madad lee
 According to Puri, the party high command is now not only confident of the district level organization, but is also creating its own information network through professional spies
 unki baat kii tasdik uttar pradesh main satta kii prabal daavedaar samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke ek netaa ne bhi kii
 The SP leader said, "the way the SP has changed the names of about 70 percent of its candidates after the announcement of candidates, the intelligence reports of private detectives are also not responsible for this
 ''asal main sapa ne ummidavaaron kii suchi sthaneey prabhariyon kii report ke aadhaar par hi taiyaar kii thi
 About a year ago, private detectives were entrusted with the task of examining the ground reality of these candidates
 jasuson kii report se is baat kaa khulaasa hua ki kuch jagahon par majboot pratyaashiyon ko bahari kahkar nakaar diya gaya, kai jagahon par aise ummidavaaron ko tikat mila jo sthaneey samikarnon par feet hi nahin baithte the
 Candidates were changed on this basis
 sapa ke ek duusare netaa bataate hai ki nijee jasuson kii report ke baad hi sapa ne nae sire se apane sabhi jila padaadhikariyon va samitiyon kaa gathan kiya
 On the other hand, behind the cut of the ticket of more than 100 BSP mlas, a similar intelligence survey conducted a year ago is being told
 jasuson kii upyogita kaa dilachasp vakya bayaan karte hue association of privet detactives and investigators (epidii) ke chairman kunwar vikram singh ne bataaya, ''ek vidhansabha chunaav se pehle party ke kai netaa apane mukhyamantri ke hi peeche pad gaye
 To deal with the situation, the chief minister contracted the private detective agency and told the party leaders that the spies would keep an eye on him
 khabaron ke jariye tivi par bhi yah baat failaai
 Some anti-party leaders were also caught by detectives

 "in this election also, a candidate from the East of Lucknow Assembly has entrusted the work of monitoring of BJP candidate Kalraj Mishra from the same constituency to the private detective company

 Directors of a private detective agency point out that many candidates from Congress and SP have resorted to private detectives to get information about the activities of their opponents within the party
 uttar pradesh ke pashchimi jilon main aise ummidavaaron kii badi taadaad he
 Such candidates are giving concrete information about the activities of their opponents within the party to the top state leadership of the party
 inhen jaankariyon ke aadhaar par pichley dinon barabanki, baharich, hamirpur samet kai jilon ke congress padaadhikariyon par karrwai kii gai thi
 The leaders have their own reasoning to give more attention to private spies except party organization
 bhaajapa main chunaav abhiyaan samiti se jude ek bade netaa bataate hai ki party sadasyon se kisi jaankaree kii tahakikat karaane par iske li hone kaa khatra hota he, jabaki nijee jasuson ke saath aisa nahin he
 The consumer using the services of spies also does not recognize them
 detective agency kaa samanvayak siyaasi party ke netaa or jasuson ke bich kii kadi hota he
 The matter is not confined to spying, but spying agencies have shown their skills in the pre-poll survey through accurate estimates
 uttar pradesh main fedral sicurity privet limited ke sanchaalak armaan khan bataate hai, ''meri company ne kai badi partiyon ke liye pre pole survey karaayaa he
 But now the entire focus has been reduced to spying of candidates
 '' armaan ke mutabik, nijee jasuson kii sevaayen lene vaala ummidavaar apane pratidwandvi kii sari suchanaaen chahta he
 In which area is he going to campaign? How many vehicles is there with him? Which prominent people of the area are with him? If an election meeting is being held, what are the things happening there? The biggest challenge before the detectives is to collect the cases of violation of Code of Conduct in time and send it to the client
 aise maamalon main jaraa-si deree pratidwandvi ko batch nikalne kaa mauka de detii he
 It takes a lot of spies to keep an eye on so many rivals

 According to Chaudhary, the agencies of Rajasthan are sending their spies in Uttar Pradesh on a large scale

 unke rahane-khaane or vaahan kaa kharch claayent ko uthaanaa hota he
 Armaan Khan says that the payment in terms of need is Rs 15,000
 rojaanaa tak chalaa jaataa he
 If during this time the detective is caught with a bang, then his money is charged separately
 uttar pradesh main 2007 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main bhi rajasthan se badi sankhya main jasoos or jasusi agenciyon kii madad lee gai thi
 In order to meet the growing demand, many Delhi-based espionage companies have opened offices in different districts of Uttar Pradesh

 Ashok Yadav, a member of one such committee and Aligarh district president of SP, says, "in elections, one has to keep an eye on where the sari or liquor is being distributed

 It should not happen that a leader gives a contract to a big spy company only to uncover the accounts of espionage expenses

 He said that a day would come when the people of pok would cross the Line of Control (loc) and demand the integration of pok
 malik ne kaha, 'desh kii aakhon main, rajyapal aisa vyakti hota he jo golf kheltaa he or janata ke liye kuch nahin karata
 But the work we have done in the last 1 year, i do not think any elected government would have done that much

 On the question related to pok, the army chief said that the government will decide on pok as per the institutions

 Apart from the Army Chief, Union Minister General VK Singh had also said that there is a special strategy for pok

 The apex court, while reading the verdict on the matter, dismissed the arguments of the petitioners for the irregularities in the transaction process

 Hearing the review petitions, the Supreme Court admitted that these petitions had no merit and the court did not agree on their arguments

 This time, captain Steven Smith has also made it clear that his team will not hesitate to sabotage against Indians
 haalanki up captain david warner ne sanket diya tha ki ve form main chal rahe bhartiya captain viraat kohli par chhintakashi nahin karenge
 The comments rahane ne yahaan patrakaron se kaha, ‘ham nahin jaanate ki ve chhintakashi karenge yaa nahin
 We have made some strategies for everyone, i will not discuss them here
 yah kaushal ke aadhaar par he yaa chhintakashi ke aadhaar par, lekin nishchit rup se ek yojana he
 We know that the Australian team plays the 'mind Game'
 hamaara uddeshy un par har myne main dabaav bananaa hoga
 "we would like to play positive and aggressive cricket not only against the spinners but also against all bowlers
" abhyaas match or test match puri tarah se alag hote hai, isaliye hamen paristhitiyon ko acchhee tarah padhanaa hoga or halaat ke anuroop khel dikhaanaa hoga, yahi ahm hoga
 ' rahane ne kaha ki team india test siries ke dauraan apane pratidwandvi ke sangyojan ke bare main neend khone ke bajaay apni majbootee par dhyaan lagaana chahega
 He said, 'the Australian team is looking forward to the India turning pitch, but it is important for us to play to our potential
 prayek team sadsy ke liye apni ranneeti ke anusaar chalanaa ahm he
 Asked questions about playing in different formats, Rahane said, 'whatever format you play, you want to give your best for your team, whether it is T20, Test or ODI
 lekin agar aap do yaa teen praroopon main khel rahe ho to yah sirf maansik rup se sanmjasy bithaana he
 It is a combination of mental harmony rather than technical coordination
 ’ Rahane told reporters here, 'we do not know if they will take a splatter or not
 hamane sabhi ke liye kuch ranneetiyaan banaayi hai, main unki yahaan charchaa nahin karuunga
 It is on the basis of skill or on the basis of spattering, but definitely a plan
 ham jaanate hai ki australian team ‘mind game’ khelti he
 Our aim will be to pressure them in every sense
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘ham spinneron ke khilaaf hi nahin balki sabhi gendbaajon ke khilaaf sakaaratmak or aakraamak cricket khelnaa chahenge
 Practice matches and Test matches are completely different, so we have to read the circumstances well and show the game according to the circumstances, this will be important
 ’ Rahane said that Team India would like to focus on their strength during the Test series rather than losing sleep over their rival combination
 unhone kaha, ‘australian team bharat terning pich kii ummid kar rahi he, lekin hamaare liye apni kshamta ke anuroop khelnaa mahatvapurn he
 It is important for each team member to follow their own strategy
 ’ vibhinn praroopon main khilne ke bare main sawaal poochne par rahane ne kaha, ‘aap jis bhi praaroop main khelte ho, aap apni team ke liye apana sarvshereshth dena chaahate ho, bhale hi yah tii20 ho, test ho yaa phir vanade
 But if you are playing in two or three formats, then it is just to mentally adjust

 ’ By the time the two-day summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) of the heads of governments of eight countries in South Asia concluded in Kathmandu, it became clear that its end was near
 lekin saarc kii sulagati chita kii bajaae aisa laga ki pradhanmantri narendra ke netritv main ek nayaa gut aakaar le rahaa he
 Modi made it very clear in his inauguration address and after that in meetings with leaders of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Maldives and Nepal, excluding Pakistan, that he and India were now determined to lead the newly emerging South Asia Huh
 pradhanmantri modi ne bade salike se telepromptor se padhakar angreji main apane bhaashan main kaha, “rishte to majboot honge, saarc ke bheetar yaa uske baahar, ham sabake bich yaa hamamen se kuch ke bich
 "the experience of Modi's journey from the United States to Japan, Vietnam and Myanmar through Australia in the last few months was palpable
 chaar maheene main duusari baar nepal main kadam rakhte hue modi ne kaaphi had tak vaishvik netaa ke rup main apni pahchaan bana lee thi
 Perhaps they had decided that now is the right time for the economic salvation of South Asia through regional trade and connectivity
 agar sarvasammati ke saarc ke siddhant ke daayre main is vichaar ko paravaan chadhgaye kaa mauka mila to thik, varanaa dakshin asia ko nayaa rup dene ke liye saarc kii bali di ja sakati he
 In this, India will open a parallel path of economic activity with all other regional capitals
 agar koi desh na maane to chhodkar ja saktaa he
 In the interest of the countries that will support India, India will take the responsibility that all of them benefit
 bhartiya adhikariyon ne bataaya ki modi ne kis tarah 25 november ke aadhe din main aadhe se adhik samay nepal ke saath aapasi baithak main bitaayaa
 Modi donated a trauma center to him, announced a new energy trade deal and also gave a billion-dollar loan to build roads and other infrastructure
 is tarah unhone maano kuch hi ghanton main itnaa kaam kiya jitna kai varshon main kabhi nahin hua
 The Nepal model will now also be adopted in the rest of South Asia
 bhartiya adhikariyon kaa kahana tha, “is nae dakshin asia main saarc to sampark kaa mahaj ek manch hoga
 That is, one path will emerge from SAARC and the other from outside it
 modi kii is eemaandaaree bhari baat ne anya netaaon ke dil ko chuaa ki haal ke varshon main bahut kuch na karne ke liye bharat jimmedaar he
 Modi's interactions with Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh, Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, Tshering Tobgay of Bhutan, Mahindra Rajapaksa of Sri Lanka, Sushil Koirala of Nepal and Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom of Maldives made it seem that at least these leaders had Modi's Have made an intention to support
 un sabane modi kii soch kii saraahna kii
 Many of them said that South Asia had long needed such zealous leadership
 tobge ke shabdon main modi or bharat “swaabhaavik netaa hai
 "such words of praise are very pleasant for the power establishment of India because its ears have been caught listening to accusations and fatwas like 'dadagiri' over the years
" pradhanmantri modi ne shaikh hasina se kaha ki sansad main videsh mantralay kii sthaayee samiti ne jamini seemaa vidheyak (sitambar 2011 main donon deshon ke bich hastakshar ke baad is makasad ke vidheyak kaa us samay bijepi ne vipaksh main rahete hue jabardast virodh kiya tha) ko manjuuri dene kii sifarish kii he or ve nepal se lautate hi is par kaam karenge
 To the President of Maldives, Modi explained the advantages of adopting advanced technology in fishing
 unhone kaha ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke rup main unhone machhliyon kii bharmaar vaale ilaakon kii pahchaan ke liye upgrah ke upyog kii vakaalat kii thi (unka kahana tha ki “machhliyon ke jhund ek jagah par 24 ghante to rahete hai”)
 His suggestion was well received by the fishermen of Gujarat
 haal main apane desh main madhyavadhi chunaavon kii ghoshnaa kar chuke mahindra rajpakshe ne modi ko srilanka yatra kaa nimantran diya
 Modi thanked the fishermen in Tamil Nadu for forgiving them
 lekin is baar unhone srilanka ke raashtrapati ko uttari praant kii prashaskeey ikai ko jameen or police sambandhi adhikaar saunpane ke bare main upadesh nahin diya, jaisaa ki may main unhone salaah di thi
 As far as Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is concerned, Indian officials said that he did not ask for an appointment with Modi
 haalanki sharif ne pakistani media se kaha, “gend ab bharat ke paale main he” kyonki bharat ne agast main videsh sachivon kii baithak radd kar di thi
 Although Pakistan's foreign policy adviser Sartaj Aziz later expressed regret over the Pakistani High Commissioner meeting Hurriyat leaders, India did not respond
 pakistan ke media ne saarc shikhar sammelan ko ‘modi arq” kii sangya de daali
 a Pakistani media analyst questioned that the Prime Minister of India ignored the principle of consent
 pakistan ke ek visheshgy kaa sawaal tha ki ab agar pakistan ne modi ke nae mantra ke tahat afghanistan ke saath vanijyik sambandh badhaane ke liye maal le ja rahe bhartiya trakon ko apane desh se guzarane kii anumati nahin di to bhi kya bharat us par ungali uthayega
 Eminent journalist Kanakamani Dixit of Nepal called Modi's strategy in SAARC as 'unilateral regionalism'
 unka kahana tha ki puure kshetra main sahakaarita andolan ko badhaane or dakshin asian pravaasiyon ko adhik sangrakshan die jane ke nepal ke prastaav par to tavajjo hi nahin di gai
 a Bangladesh expert described Modi's proposal of the SAARC satellite as 'very welcome' but said that Modi had not consulted any other country before announcing the gift in Sriharikota a few months ago
 bharat ke ek jaankaar ke anusaar modi par kuch kar dikhaane kaa bhoot savaar he or unhone china or america se sabak liya he ki apane kaamon ke bal par ilaake main sikaa jamaa lo
 There is no doubt that Sharif committed a double mistake in Kathmandu
 unhone sadak or rail sampark ke liye kshetravyapee samjhaute par hastakshar se saream inkaar karke mejabaan nepal ko mushkil main daal diya
 And now, on November 30, Sharif, returning home amidst threats from another leader of the opposition Imran Khan, seems weaker than ever, because even a man named Narendra Modi has left him for which he is the almighty army of Pakistan
 He came to Delhi for the oath ceremony in May, taking the risk of resentment
 beshak modi sharif kii kismat ko lekar bahut adhik chintit nahin hai
 In fact, while shaping the new future of South Asia at the Nepal SAARC Summit, he made it very clear that now he will think in this area

 charchit film abhinetri rekha ne mangalvaar ko manonith sadsy ke rup main rajyasabha kii sadsyta kii shapath lee
 Rekha Ganesan took oath in English
 shapath ke liye naam pukaare jane par or unke shapath lene ke baad sadasyon ne megen thapthapaakar unka swaagat kiya
 After Rekha was sworn in, Chairman Hamid Ansari congratulated him
 rekha ne haath jodakar sadan main maujuud pradhanmantri manmohan singh, vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali sahit anya sadasyon kaa abhivadan kiya
 Rekha came a few minutes before the meeting of the House and nominated member HK Dua gave her her seat
 rekha ko sadan main 99 number kii seat mili he
 Jaya Bachchan had come to the House some time ago and the two famous actresses of Hindi films did not greet each other
 shapath grahan karne ke baad rekha apni seat par aayi
 On one side is the seat of nominated Anu Aga

 Javed Akhtar, sitting next to Ganguly, was seen having some conversation with Rekha
 prashnkaal ke dauraan 11 bajkar kareeb 20 minute par rekha sadan se baahar chali gayin
 Let me tell you, Rekha is nominated for the Rajya Sabha under Article 80 of the Constitution
 jisamen sarkaar kii anushansa par raashtrapati rajyasabha ke 250 sadasyon main se 12 ko manonith kar saktaa he
 One of those 12 members is also named actress Rekha, but the oath to become a Rajya Sabha MP is yet to be formalized

 It will also be a challenge to live up to the expectations of the people of the country for the line that wreaks havoc on the screen

 Aslam Sherkhan, a former Olympian and Congress leader, has alleged that big sports awards in the country are not received without recommendation and corruption
 unhone ye bhi aarope lagaaya ki arjuna award ke dhai lakh rupee ke liye federation ko lakh rupee to dene hi padate hai itnaa hi nahin yadi rakam moti he to or zyada paise bhi dena pad saktaa he
 Without naming, he said that it was in front of him that when there were two good players in the hockey team, he would make one captain and one was promised the prize and from here corruption would start and right talent The award was not available
 asalam sherkhan ne kaha ve bhartiya hockey team se khel chuke hai aurasystem kaa hissaa bhi rah chuke hai
 He said that you do not hide your stomach from the midwife
 asalam sher khan ne kaha ki sarkaar koi bhi ho kaam ek sa hota he
 On the other hand, Arjuna Award winner Jalaluddin has denied these allegations of Aslam Sher Khan
 unhone kaha ki kai khilaadi chhot sakate hai lekin karpshan se arjuna award, khel ratna or padam shri nahin milte hai
 Continued hearing in the Supreme Court on Section 497 related to extramarital relations between men and women
 supreme court ne guuruuvaar ko is maamle main tippanee karte hue poocha ki agar koi vivaahit mahila kisi anya vivaahit purush se sambandh banaati he, to phir is maamle main sirf purush ko hi doshi kyon mana jaae?supreme court ke paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth ipisi kii dhara 497 ko chunauti dene vaali yachika par sunwaayee kar rahi he
 During the hearing, the court expressed surprise over the provision of this section and said that if an unmarried man forms a relationship with a married woman, it would not be adultery, but if a married man does the same thing then it is a crime
 jabaki mahila aparaadh main hissedaar hokar bhi jimmedaar nahin
 The court said that if the man is convicted, then the woman is equally at fault
 sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne hairaani jataate hue kaha ki agar vivaahit mahila ke pati kii sahmati se koi vivaahit purush sambandh banaata he to wo aparaadh nahin he
 Does this mean that the personal property of a woman and man is that she should do as she wishes
 court ne kaha ki bhale hi is kanoon main mahila ko doshi naa bana kar unke haq kii baat kii ho, lekin ek tarah se ye kanoon mahila-virdohi bhi he
 The comment stated that this law violates the right of equality of women

 The New York Times wrote that Modi reached the National Sept 11 Memorial and Museum in Manhattan before reaching the United Nations

 '' bijepi kii andruni kalah har din ek nayaa hi rang lekar saamne aa rahi he
 Sanjay Joshi has resigned from all the posts of the party in the midst of continuously emerging controversies
 bijepi main sanjay joshi ke paas uttar pradesh kaa vishesh prabhaar bhi tha, jise ab unhone chhod diya he
 Sanjay Joshi sent his resignation to BJP President Nitin Gadkari, which was accepted
 sanjay joshi ne ajtak ko bataaya ki unhone party kii praathmik sadsyta nahin chodi he, ve ab bhi bijepi main hi hai
 However, he admitted that he had resigned because of Narendra Modi
 nitin gadakari ko bheje patr main sanjay joshi ne likhaa he ki ve party ke sabhi vishesh jimmedaariyon se mukt hona chaahate hai
 Significantly, Sanjay Joshi is considered close to RSS and Nitin Gadkari
 narendra modi ke saath kadavaahat bhare rishte kii vajah se sanjay joshi ne haal hi main bijepi kaaryakarini se istipha diya tha
 Reports of tension between Sanjay Joshi and Narendra Modi have been in the news for the past few days
 pichley maheene mumbai main hui bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main narendra modi tabhi shaamil hue, jab sanjay joshi ne kaaryakarini kii sadsyta se istipha de diya
 This attitude of Narendra Modi was also condemned by the party leaders and activists in a sarcastic tongue
 pichley dinon dilli main bijepi karyaalay or party ke varisht netaa murali manohar joshi ke awaas ke saath-saath ahmedabad or anya shaharon main bhi joshi kii badi si tasviir ke saath poster chipkaae gaye the, jisamen modi kaa naam liye bagaiyr likhaa tha ki kisi ek vyakti kii taanaashaahee nahin chalegi
 The gesture was clearly towards Modi
 narendra modi ke ravaiye kii aalochana bijepi ke mukhpatr 'camel sandesh' main bhi kii gai
 At the same time, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) praised Sanjay Joshi and gave a shock to Modi
 aresas ke samachar patr 'paanchajnya' main bhi modi kii aalochana kii gai
 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Sushil Modi also targeted Narendra Modi, saying that no person can be in the party and no dictatorship can be accepted
 susheel modi ne yah baat angreji ke ek samachar patr ko die saakshaatkaar main kahi
 He, however, did not explicitly name Narendra Modi
 sanjay joshi ko uttar pradesh kaa prabhaar saunpe jane se bhi narendra modi naaraaz the or isliye ve uttar pradesh main haal hi main sampann hue vidhansabha chunaav se pehle party ke prachaar ke liye vahaan nahin gaye the
 However, with the new move of Sanjay Joshi, the bjp's pride is now coming to the surface
 notebandi par nitish kumaar ke lagaataar samarthan ke baad congress ne yah saaf kiya he ki mahagathbandhan ke piem candidet uske netaa rahul gandhi hi honge
 The Congress is upset that Nitish Kumar is trying to prove himself as the leader of the secular alliance
 times of india kii khabar ke mutabik, congress ko lagata he ki nitish ne notebandi par alag tarah kaa rukh isliye apanaaya, kyonki vah 2019 ke chunaavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue apni ek swatantra chhavi banaae rakhana chaahate hai
 Significantly, JDUK chief Nitish had surprised everyone by supporting the Modi government on demonetisation and this has raised concern among his allies, the Congress is very angry because it is the largest party to protest against it
 lalu prasad ke manaane par congress bihar main nitish ko netaa maanane ko taiyaar ho gai thi, lekin ab unke ravaie se donon dalon ke maathe par shikan aa gaya he
 There was a large-scale protest led by Rahul Gandhi against demonetisation in the country by the Congress and now Nitish's move makes the party feel that it will suffer
 congress ke netaaon ko lagata he ki loksabhaa chunaavon ko dhyaan main rakhkar nitish ne yah ravaiya apanaaya he
 Congress leaders say that there can be equations in Bihar, but Rahul's leadership in parliamentary elections can not be challenged

 According to Sehwag, Sandeep's specialty is that he knows how to swing the ball and specializes in the art of taking the ball away from the batsman
 kings ilevan ke liye sandip behad ahm gendbaaj hai kyonki vah hamen shuruaati daur main safalataa dilaate hai
 The first and second overs are very important in T20 format and if the wickets are got in these overs then the pressure can be put on the opposition team

 guddu singh ko kunda ke bahubali vidhayak or purv kunda riyasat ke bhadri gharaane ke raghuraaj pratap singh urf raja bhaiya kaa driver bataaya jaataa he
 Guddu Singh was twice defeated by Nanhe Singh in the panchayat elections

 This Nanhe Singh Yadav called the police officers a threat to his life, but it was ignored

 On getting information about the incident, a large number of supporters started collecting weapons with their houses in Balipur village
 raat sava aath baje graminon ne kamta paal ke ghar main aag laga di
 At the same time CO Ziaul Haq proceeded to the Pradhan's house in the backward path in the village, but fearing the firing by the villagers, Gunner Imran and SSI Kunda Vinay Kumar Singh, who were engaged in protecting the CO, hid in the field

 The boo of conspiracy that arose out of suspicion arising from it has also surrounded Raja Bhaiya
 maamle ke garmane or vipaksh ke hamalavar hote hi raja bhaiya ne mantri pad se istipha diya to mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne maamle ko sibiai ke hawaale kar diya
 But the CBI inquiry exercise has postponed the response to those questions, which were holding the role of the police and the government to the fore in this development

 On the Tahrir of 24-year-old Parveen Azad, co's wife, the police have registered a case of conspiracy against Raja Bhaiya and his representatives Hariom Shankar Srivastava, Kunda District Panchayat President Gulshan Yadav, Rohit Singh and Guddu Singh for robbery, mutiny and murder
 vakil es

 kushvaha kehete hai, ‘‘do mukademe darj karaane ke peeche sarkaar kii manshaa saaf he
 If the police had a slight coincidence with the case filed by the co's wife, why would she file another case? Says Shesha Narayan Tripathi, a close aide of Raja Bhaiya and former president of Advocates Association, Kunda, says, "on the night of March 2, Raja Bhaiya was in Lucknow
 raat main ve is ghatana kii jaankaree dene mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke ghar gaye to parveen aaazaad kii exiar main aropit guddu singh bhi unke saath the
 In such a case, these charges will not be proved in court

 In this case also, an FIR was registered in Pratapgarh Kotwali accusing Raja Bhaiya, former MLC Akshay Pratap Singh

 The High Court has stayed the election of the co-operative bank after a petition was filed by local lawyer Laxmikant Dwivedi

 Three months ago, four Amresh Singh servants were tried in a gang rape case involving a Dalit teenager in Hathigawan area

 CO Jiahul Haq was also investigating the matter
 sio daftar ke ek adhikari bataate hai ki is maamle main sio par kaaphi dabaav pad rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, on the order of the government, the matter had gone to the CBCID, which was upset with some of the close cos of Raja Bhaiya
 haalanki raja bhaiya or sthaneey police ke bich sambandh bhi lagaataar kathghare main rahe hai
 Questions are also being raised on the then SO of Hathigawan and the now suspended Manoj Shukla, who was with the CO at the time of the incident
 varsh 2007 main vidhansabha chunaav ke pehle tak manoj shukla isi hathigavaan thane main tainaat the, lekin baad main mayawati kii sarkaar banane ke baad unka tabadalaa pratapgarh ke baahar ho gaya
 After all, what was the reason that after the formation of the SP government, Manoj returned again and he got a posting in Hathigwan police station a month and a half ago? On the allegations of leaving the CO alone in Balipur village, he gives his clarification
 "on March 2, at about eight o'clock in the night, i and CO Sahab reached Balipur village
 tabhi mujhe pataa chalaa ki gaanv ke ek kinare kuch makaanon main aag lagi he
 i walked towards that side
 haalanki is dauraan maine apni jeep main lage syran ko is tarah bajvaya ki gaanv main maujuud bheed ko lage ki kai gadipoon main police maukey par pahunch gai he
 Raja Bhaiyya's rival and BSP leader of Pratapgarh, Shiv Prakash, says "fighter", "raja Bhaiyya reigns in Kunda because of the influential and domineering
 yahi vajah he ki aam janata peedit hone ke baad bhi kuch bolne ko taiyaar nahin he
 It is difficult to believe that CO is killed in the middle population of Balipur village and the villagers have not seen anything
 ’’avaidh khanan kaa gorakhdhandhakunda ke aparaadh ko ganga kaa pani bhi sinchataa he
 There is a stock of sand in the foothills of the river Ganga flowing along the banks of Kunda and there is a huge demand for sand in nearby districts like Rae Bareli, Kanpur, Allahabad, Banaras
 inhen kaarnon ne kunda ko baaluu ke avaidh khanan kaa ek bada centre bana diya he
 Illegal mining has been going on for the last five years at Gotani Ganga Ghat and Manikpur in Kunda

 Illegal mining of sand is traded
 kunda kotwali main tainaat ek daaroga bataate hai ki jiyaul haq aise pehle adhikari the, jinhone avaidh khanan ke khilaaf abhiyaan chhedaa
 On January 18, Ziaul Haq along with SDM raided Gotni Ghat and seized three sand-loaded trucks and six tractors along with the JCB machine found on the spot and sent to Manikpur police station
 daaroga kehete hai, ‘‘jiyaul haq apni sakhti ke kaaran kunda ke prabhaavshaalee logon ko khatak rahe the
 Apart from this, the CO also curbed the business of capturing the ponds of the village society in this area and selling its fish illegally

 It has been two months since the 12 km long Navana Road was built in Kunda, but it has become risky
 kunda ke congressi netaa ram shankar yadav kehete hai, ‘‘kunda se satee oonchaahar or rampur tehsil main udyog-dhandhe or behtareen sadaken hai, lekin kunda main to bijli hi chah se aath ghante aati he
 Since the incident in Balipur village, some more electricity has started coming

 There are about 150 gram sabhas under Kunda assembly constituency, but most of the villages are backward
 kunda tehsil ke block kalakankar main aane vaale alapur gaanv ke krishna kumaar yadav bataate hai ki gaanv main 70 fisadi garib kisaan ab bhi jhonpadipoon main rah rahe hai

 yadav-muslim-thakur vot bank ko saadhane ke lihaaj se raja bhaiya sapa ke liye behad mufeed sabit ho rahe the
 After the formation of the SP government in the state, in June last year, after the gang rape of a Dalit teenager in Asthan village of Kunda, the violence that engulfed four dozen Muslim houses in the fire, brought the Muslim and Thakur class face to face
 Had brought it asthaan gaanv nivasee nizaam ahamed kehete hai, ‘‘raja bhaiya ke aadamiyon ne hi pichley varsh asthaan gaanv main musalamaanon ke ghar phunke the

 After this, after the expansion of the Council of Ministers in February last month, taking the jail department from Raja Bhaiya and limiting them to the Food and Logistics Department is also seen as a link
 yah andeh tab kuch or saaf hua, jab 6 march ko balipur gaanv main mrit pradhan nanhe singh yadav ke ghar pahunche mukhyamantri ke saath maujuud ajam khan par raja bhaiya ke samarthakon ne jamkar bhadaas nikaali

 The PCB chairman, however, clarified that the board had not made a mistake by appointing Afridi as captain of the T20 team last year
 ‘afridi akelaa jeet dilaataa he’afridi bahut shandaar cricketer he
 He has single-handedly won many times
 pichley ek do baar wo fail ho gaya to us par focus karne lagate hai
 This is not a balanced approach
 afridi kii jagah puure desh main bahut hi ikonic he
 He is the icon of the country
 desh ko bhi use puraa samarthan dena chahie
 "coach can be changed by June", the PCB chief also confirmed that the board is also planning to replace the coach after the tournament
 shehryaar ne kaha, ‘ham ise dekh rahe hai
 Waqar's contract is till June
 maine is mudde par wasim akram or kuch anya senior khilaadiyon ke saath baat kii he or unhone kaha ki ham videshi ko niyukt karen yaa sthaneey coach ko, vah team ke liye sarvshereshth nattejey de paae
 Personally, i don't see anything wrong with having a foreign coach because we have done well in the past
 or bab woolmer hamaare sarvshereshth coach the
 "what is wrong with Imran's invitation", Shehryar also dismissed suggestions that there was some sort of factionalism in the team or no player was motivated
 shehryaar khan ne kaha, ‘main aapse kah duun ki world cap match main bharat ke khilaaf ek baar phir haarana niraashajanak he lekin team main koi gutbaji nahin he or khilaadi ekajute or acha pradarshan karne ke liye prerit hai
 The PCB chief also sees nothing wrong in inviting former captain Imran Khan to interact with the team ahead of the match in Kolkata
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe isamen kuch bhi galat najar nahin aata
 It has nothing to do with team management responsibilities
 imran bada naam hai or vah khilaadiyon se sirf itnaa kehane aae the ki sahaj raho or bade match main dabaav nahin lo
 'umar Akmal was reprimanded Shaharyar also confirmed that the team management had reprimanded Umar Akmal for keeping him in the batting order during the team meeting with Imran
 akmal ne eden gardns main match se thik pehle imran khan se khaas aagrah kiya ki wo afridi se unhen (akmal ko) ballebaaji ke liye pehle bhejne ko kahen
 This matter came in the media and after this Akmal was reprimanded by the Pakistan Cricket Board
 shehryaar khan ne is dauraan yah bhi spasht kiya
 He said, 'don't know what Akmal said
 management ne unhen bula kar kaha ki ye baaten galat hai
 This team is against spirit
 wo number chaar par kheltaa he isse ooncha kya khelegaa
 'we were welcomed warmly in India
 The PCB chief also praised the security and hospitality of the Pakistan team in India and Kolkata
 is dauraan shehryaar khan ne samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya, ‘bharat main mujhe or pakistan kii team ke saath bahut acha vyavhaar kiya gaya
 He also said that we were given a very warm welcome by the cab president Sourav Ganguly in Kolkata and the Chief Minister of Bengal
 ’unhone kaha, ‘ham team ke liye suraksha intjaamon se puri tarah santusht hai
 There was a lot of excitement about the match against Pakistan in India and i would like to say through you that the time has come for us to start a bilateral series
 ’‘11veen baar ham bharat se haare’jab pisibi pramukh se yah poocha gaya ki ham 11veen baar bharat se haare to unhone kaha, ‘pehle ham bahut jite hai hindustan se
 In 2012 we go there and return after winning the series
 hamaare kai yuva cricketer achche aa rahe hai or nateeja kuch samay ke baad saamne aane lagegaa
 On why India is not insisted on defeating India in the World Cup, Shaharyar Khan said, 'we are insisting on this too
 ’‘semifinal main pahonchega pakistan’shehryaar khan ne kaha, ‘ham bharat se jarur haar gaye lekin agle do match main australia or newjiland ko haraa kar team semifinal main pahunch jaaegi
 The preparation of our team is excellent and there is no lack of emotion in them
 bharat ke khilaaf bhi unki taiyaari behatar thi lekin wo ummiido ke anuroop pradarshan nahin kar sake

 champions trophy main bharat kii karaari haar ke baad har bhartiya kaa dil dukhi tha
 People were crying, and expressing their anger
 logon ko dukh is baat kaa bhi zyada tha ki ham pakistan se final main haare hai
 Now a video is going viral on social media, in which a child is crying after the defeat of India
 or uski mummy use chup karaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 When the whole team failed, these two players were standing proudly! What is the video saying etc
? Actually, the name of this child is Adi
 jo hardik pandya ke out hone ke baad jabardast ro rahaa he, vah is baat se dukhi he ki rabindra jadeja ne unhen out kyon karavaaya
 Adi is saying in the video that India has now fallen 8 wickets, now how India will win
 vahiin aadi kii mummy use chup karwaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Click on this photo to see the video
 
 
 chota bhai bolaa- kohli jadeja ko maaregaa
 
 jab aadi ro rahaa tha, to us samay uskaa chota bhai bhi vahaan par khadaa tha
 Then his brother said that you, shut up
 abhi hardik jaakar viraat kohli ko batayega, phir kohli jadeja ko thappad maaregaa
 But still Adi is not able to stop herself from crying
 video main vah baar-baar kah rahaa he ki jadeja ne hardik pandya ko out karaayaa he
 After the crushing defeat, Team India gave a great game sense, ICC also saluted like this: Pandya, in the 27th over of the match, Jadeja played a shot off the ball of Hasan Ali on which Pandya wanted to take the run, but Jadeja refused to take the run
 After which they both reached the same end and as a result Pandya had to lose his knack
 is ran out ko lekar soshal media par jadeja par bhadaas nikaali
 But Pandya was run out on a ball played by Jadeja, due to which people on social media have fiercely targeted Ravindra Jadeja, someone compared him to Kattapa of Bahubali and someone spoke of taking a fatwa against him
 PAK ke khilaaf team india kii is haar ne 2003 vishwacap final kii yaad dilaa di
 
 
 
 
 
 is team ke saath to world cap jeetne se rahe viraat kohli? Aam Aadmi Party CM candidate Arvind Kejriwal from Delhi is not a 'J' type leader
 vah netagiri ke glamras swaroop ko dhwast karte hai
 Dress like us and speak like us
 aage pesh hai aisi baaten, jinke aadhaar par main arvind kejariwal ko hi vot duungaa
 
 
 
 1
 Kejriwal talks about what is understandable; two school children in a stately tent waiting for 'netaji' and free Kachori being distributed outside
 helicopter utarataa he to dher sari dhul udakar bacchon ke daunon main mil jaati he
 Then one of them blinks and says, "got it, Pappu
" netaa je hota, je
 'I will choose Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi as he is not a' j 'type leader
 vah netagiri ke glamras swaroop ko dhwast karata he
 Dresses like us, speaks like us
 vah companiyon ke peepiti pregentation vaali 'four pi' or 'five es' tip bhashaa nahin bolta, balki samaj main aane vaali sidhi-saral baat karata he
 Why is he not saying wrong? Read
 
 
 main ajay maakan ko vot duungaa, kyonki
 
 
 2
 ranneetik galati thi, maafee bhi maangiistipha dene jaisi galati ke sivaay arvind ke bahikhaate main kuch bhi bura nahin he or ye galati bhi mahaj ek 'ranneetik' galati he
 You also make such mistakes while preparing for the exam
 phir bhi kejariwal jab janata ke bich jaataa he, to donon haath jodakar maafee maangata he
 In this era where power is an addiction, how many such leaders have you seen? Read - i will vote for Kiran Bedi, because
 
 
 3
 There is no strong reason why Kejriwal's intentions should be distrusted by bringing marginalized questions into the debate
 dilli ye jaanati he ki banda kuch bhi kare, bhrashtachar kabhi nahin karegaa, na hone degaa
 If you have formed a party in the name of the common man, then he will do the work of the first person, otherwise the public will bang again
 barason se haashiye par pade kuch jaruri sawaalon ko aam aadmi party raajnneeti ke centre main laai he
 Transparency and political ethics are important among them
 'insaan kaa insaan se ho bhaichara, yahi paigaam hamaara' party kaa antham he, jo gharvaapasi, lav jihad, sadhvi, sakshi or yogi ke daur main sukun dene vaala he
 4
 paise kaa dete hai puraa hisabam aadmi party dinar, chaay party yaa kahin se bhi paisa jutaaye, uskaa byoraa apni website par saarvajanik karti he
 But who does not give money to congress-bjp to contest elections, we do not know
 agar koi balldor se paisa detaa he to kya balldor se apana kaam nahin karavaayega? bharat main rishwat kaa puraatan siddhant to yahi kahata he ki karavaayega or jarur karavaayega
 Look at how much Adani's wealth has grown in the last few months
 aam aadmi party chunavi funding ko artiai ke daayre main laane ke paksh main he
 If bjp-congress are honest then why are they against it? Is there anything that has an exposition? 5
 daag in par nahin, auron par he
 
 
 Speaking of support from Congress, remember that AAP did not seek support from Congress, Congress had already handed over the letter of support to LG
 congress ne AAP ko bina maange baahar se samarthan diya tha
 Just like NCP did to BJP in Maharashtra
 chunaav se pehle modi ne jis ensipi to 'neshnal karpt party' kaha, baad main usee ke bahari samarthan se bahumat paas karvaa liya or sanvaidhanik baarikiyon se bekhbar janata ko ullu banane ke liye 'dhwani mat' kaa pardaa daal diya
 The same BJP is now considering forming a government with the PDP in Jammu and Kashmir
 6
 Neekatya said it is necessary from experience, Kejriwal has less experience of running the government? But the basic problem of our system has never been 'lack of experience'
 kya congressiyon ke paas kam anubhav tha desh chalaane kaa? yah vah daur he jab hamen saaf niyat vaale netaa chahie
 We will compromise with experience
 phir bhi agar aap anubhav ko ahm aadhaar maanate hai to kiran bedi ko kis munh se vot denge? jumma-jumma chaar din unako raajnneeti main hue hai or unka litmas test bhi abhi baaki he
 It does not appear that she will do anything other than the traditional structure and methods of the BJP
 7
 Healthy dialogue is also a reason
 i will choose a leader who believes in healthy dialogue and open debate, not to block rivals
 banda sabake saamne bahes ko taiyaar he, par 'sabase achche vaktaaon kii party' munh chura rahi he
 Does the BJP fear anything? Otherwise, then come forward, debate on the lines of America

 Gave a lot in 49 days, now some 49 days
 arvind kejariwal ne 666 litre pani muft kar diya or 400 unit tak bijli istemaal karne waalon ke bijli ke bill aadhe kar die
 It cost subsidy more than 200 crores and a large section benefited
 ab vidambnaa dekhie, loksabhaa chunaav main 714 karod rupee foonkane vaali bijepi or 500 karod bahaane vaali congress kah rahi he ki sabsidi dena galat he
 My brother is laughing
 silinder kii sabsidi bhi hataa lo phir to
 9
 chorbazari ke virodh main tha andolichha, ye bijli par sabsidi-vyavastha bhi tempereri thi
 After a fair audit of the power companies, a permanent solution was to be found
 isiilie kejariwal ne bijli companiyon ke audit ke aadesh die, jo congress 15 saal main nahin kar pai
 Kejriwal's movement was not that electricity is expensive
 andolan tha ki bijli main chori he
 Companies suppress a large share of the profits and pressurize them to raise prices by showing themselves on the paper in a loss
 lekin 49 dinon kii sarkaar main kejariwal ne bataa diya ki vah in companiyon par nakel kasne kii niyat se aae hai
 The suppressed profits will be extracted from the corporate circles and the public will benefit from it
 kejariwal ne shila dikshit or mukesh ambani ke khilaaf exiaar ke aadesh die
 In this country, it is necessary to put hands on powerful people like Ambani and Sheela
 kaabil-e-zikr he ki bijepi ne chunaav prachaar main 'damaad ji' par bahut aarope lagaae, par chunaav baad, nateeja dhak ke paat
 10
 sangharsh kaa to inaam milanaa hi chahiabijapi ek sthapit party he, AAP abhi sangharshrat he
 There will be many opportunities to vote for BJP
 agar AAP kaa shashan pasand na aae to paanch saal baad phir jita denge bijepi yaa congress ko
 But the struggle that Kejriwal and his team have fought in limited resources, they should get their reward now
 main yah nahin kahata ki aam aadmi party mere sapanom kii party he
 But i am sure that he is better than BJP and Congress
 puure desh main ek hi party kaa raaj hota he to nirankush satta kii gunjaaish banane lagati he
 Therefore, there is a need to stop bjp's Vijay Rath in Delhi, so that 'check and balance' remains
 gandhi ke mulk main andolanon ke prati ashavad ko jinda rakhane ke liye bhi kejariwal ko jitaana chahie
 If he does not win, no one will ever stand in this country to bear the 'burden' of our dreams
 tab chunate rahanaa baari-baari se, bijepi or congress ko

 India vs Pakistan means the biggest battle on the field
 maidan phir haaki kaa ho yaa cricket kaa
 Twenty-two years ago, India won this battle on hockey grounds and today, when both rivals in cricket are at the same stage, Pakistan's most experienced hockey star Rehan Butt believes that India can have an upper hand
 
 vishwa cap or rashtramandal khelon main bhartiya sarajameen par shikast jhelane vaali pakistani haaki team ke star striker rehaan ne kaha ki mohali main 30 march ko hone vaale vishwa cap cricket semifinal main muqabla sirf hunar kaa nahin balki dabaav ko jhelane kaa he or isamen mahendra singh dhoni kii team ko phayda mil saktaa he
 Rehan said, 'this competition is not about ability but pressure
 isamen vahi team jeetegi jo dabaav kaa bakhubi saamana karegi
 It is not easy to defeat India in front of the Indian audience and given the past record of the World Cup, i think India will get a psychological boost
 ’ pichley saal farvari main dilli main vishwa cap haaki ke lig match main bharat ne pakistan ko 4-1 se maat di thi jabaki rashtramandal khelon main bhi raajapaal singh kii aguwai vaali bhartiya team ne khachaakhach bhare major dhyanchand stadium par pakistan ko 7-4 se haraaya tha
 The same thrill is being felt across the border today as the teams of Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Shahid Afridi will face off in the semi-finals of World Cup cricket on March 30 in Mohali
 vishwa cap main pakistan kabhi bharat ko haraa nahin sakaa he
 Rehan said, 'we suffered two defeats in India last year and the reason was Indian audience
 dhoni kii team ko bhi darshakon kaa usee tarah saath milegaa
 This will be the most positive thing for India, but if the players dominate this pressure, it can be negative
 ’ unhone kaha ki puure pakistan main is match ko lekar kaaphi romaanch he or austrailia ke khilaaf quarter final main pakistani cricketpremi dua kar rahe the ki bharat jite
 Rehan said, 'the whole Pakistan wanted India to win so that we get a chance to play India in the semi-finals
 chir pratidwandvi ke khilaaf vishwa cap main khilne kaa majaa hi kuch or he or ummid he ki pakistan apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karegaa
 Asked if the same thrill is felt in both the games over mutual confrontation, he said, "cricket is a bit slow, so the thrill is different in it, whereas in Hockey there is a lot of rest in 70 minutes, then the atmosphere is different
 ’ unhone ise bharat kii ballebaaji or pakistan kii gendbaaji kaa muqabla bataate hue virendra sahvaag or sachin tendulkar ko pakistan kii raah main sabase badi baadha bataaya

 hindi filmon ke mahanayake amitabh bachchan ‘fiction sho’ main ek abhinayta ke taur par chote parde par apni pari shuru karne ko lekar kaaphi utsuk or utsahit he
 Amitabh stepped into the world of television programs 15 years ago with the game show 'kaun Banega Crorepati', which was very successful
 haalanki ab vah chote parde par pehali baar kisi ‘fiction sho’ main kaam karne ja rahe hai
 He said, 'I want to do something different on TV
 main ‘fiction sho’ main kaam karnaa chahta hum
 It is too early to say anything about the story of this show
 ’ film nirdeshak anuraag kashyap is sho ke kala nirdeshak honge
 Amitabh said about the actress who allegedly committed suicide, 'I am saddened and shocked by this news
 main sabhi se anurodh karata hum ki ve avsaad main aisa kadam na uthaaen
 Many people in the world are sad, worried and frustrated with life because their dreams could not come true
 main unase jivan main haar na maanane kaa nivedan karata hum
 It is worth mentioning that Jiya started her film career with Amitabh in the film 'no Word'
 punjab neshnal bank main kareeb 11,500 karod rupee ke mahaghotaale ke saamne aane ke baad is bank kii barmer shakha main ek or ghotaalaa saamne aayaa he
 This time there has been talk of fraud in this bank under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana
 sibiai ne is maamle main cese bhi darj kiya he
 The Mudra Yojana is an ambitious scheme of PM Modi, which he often refers to on the question of unemployment
 is yojana main kam byaaj daron par lone diya jaataa he or lone dene ke baad is raashi ke jariye aavedak ko kuch sampatti arjeet kerani hoti he
 This was not done in the Mudra loan issued from this branch
 sibiai ke mutabik rajasthan main pienbi kii barmer shakha main ek senior branch manager ne sitambar 2016 or march 2017 ke bich 'beyimaani or dhokhadhadi' se 26 mudra lone' baante
 It has been said that due to this the bank suffered a loss of about Rs 62 lakh
 bijness standard ke mutabik sibiai kaa kahana he ki taaja banking ghotaale main pienbi ne vyapaar yaa awaas kaa satyaapan kiye bina aavedakon ko mudra lone jari kar die
 Under this scheme, micro loans were issued under the Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency (MUDRA) scheme
 sibiai ne is maamle main pienbi barmer shahar ke tatkaaleen branch manager inder chandra chandaavat ke khilaaf cese darj kiya he
 The CBI has said that they did not check the applicants before issuing the loan, did not do physical verification and did not even check the applicants' assets after the loan was given
 sibiai ne bataaya kijari karne se pehle 26 lone main se keval ek kii jaanch kii gai
 In addition, any bank branch is allowed to issue loans to people living in the vicinity of 25 km
 lekin, pienbi ke cese main 100 kimi dur ke ilaake main rahane waalon ko bhi lone jari kiye gaye
 Now five of these 26 loans have become npas
 bank ab 62 lakh rupee vasuul bhi nahin saktaa he, kyonki inhone aavedakon ne koi sampatti bhi arjeet nahin kii
 The CBI came to know that the PNB deputy general manager posted in Jodhpur in this case was also investigated and the manager of this branch was also suspended, but the suspension was later withdrawn
 ab ghotaale ke aaropee kii rajasthan kii abu road sthit pienbi shakha main niyukti he
 Before that, diamond traders Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi had cheated PNB with thousands of crores of rupees
 ab nae ghotaale main chandaavat par aarope hai ki unhone kareeb do karod rupee ke mudra lone kii raashi ko privet khaaton main transfar kara liya
 Team India will be seen in a new look on the tour of New Zealand

 It can be said that in the five-odi series against New Zealand, the Indian team is ready to come out with full enthusiasm
 isse pehle 2007 ke world cap ke samay team india kii uniform main pher badal kii gai thi
 After the change in the uniform, the fortunes of Team India started changing rapidly

 The book is written by Brajesh Rajput
 ise manjul publicing house se prakashit kiya gaya he
 Off-screen is the best way to understand the real journalism of TV, apart from debates on channels in prime time
 maukey par khadey reporter or vijuals kii madad se kisi khabar ko samajhnaa darshakon ke liye aasaan hota he or rochak bhi
 But the journalist and the cameraman's struggle to reach there is usually not exposed
 darasal, usee sangharsh ke kisse hai tivi reporting kii in 75 kahaniyon main
 Be it an accident or a function, a personality or a government, a natural disaster or a social concern - the eyes of a TV journalist always try to see what is not being shown under the cover of the camera
 bakaul brajesh, "tivi main saamaanya kaam to hota hi kam he
 To do what is not done is the challenge of television reporting
 ''khabar kii pushti, vijuals laane kii hode, maukey se pis tu camera or camere kii aankh se asaamaanya dikhaanaa—tivi patrakarita kii in ulajhanon se kaise ek reporter roj sangharsh karata he, ise is kitaab kejariye samajha ja saktaa he
 To get to the bottom of the news, sometimes the cameraman gets hurt and sometimes the journalist
 media ke madhyam se janata khabar dekhati he or patrkaar khabar banane se pehle or baad kii kahani
 The language of the book is simple
 kahani kii tarah padhenge to man main vijuals swatah hi tairne lagenge
 This book, written on TV journalism, hurt on many such issues from which reporters have been around two to four days
 masalan, ek sthiti aisi bhi he jahaan aisa he tab bhi khabar he or aisa nahin he tab bhi khabar he
 Hard news is too much, so how to replace soft news related to important issues, how to find whether or not TV material is in the news, how to stay in the race of TRP, in all these times, reporters run after such things
 Seems to laugh at himself later
 kitaab main bebaak tareeke se kuch aise kisse shaamil kiye gaye hai jahaan news kii kawarej se zyada kshamta kisi chote-se video yaa audio ke hisse kii hoti he
 Youngsters aspiring to make a career in TV journalism read it as a course book
 class ke kisi lacture main itani kahani or kisse nahin milenge
 This knowledge of the field saved in the book will prove to be nothing less than practical
 *** The Modi government at the Center has given the slogan of New India
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa sapana he ki new india main desh kii arthvyavastha 5 lakh karod dollar yani 5 trillian dollar kii ho jaae
 Actually, India was once called the golden bird
 lekin angrejon ne bharat kaa khajaana khaali kar diya
 After that, once again economic growth started in India since 1991, when the policy of liberalization and economic reform has been implemented
 nirmala seetaraman ne loksabhaa main 2019-20 kaa bajet pesh karte hue 2024-25 tak bharat ko 5 trillian dollar kii arthvyavastha banane ke liye vijan prastut kiya
 The government said that the main basis of this vision is investment-driven development and employment generation
 darasal arthvyavastha vah saranchana he, jiske tahat sabhi aarthik gatividhiyon kaa sanchaalan hota he
 Production consumption and investment are fundamental activities of the economy
 sakal gharelu utpaada (GDP) kaa prayog arthshaastriyon dwaara arthvyavastha ko maapne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The echo of the New India in the budget says that the emphasis is on promoting domestic and foreign investment for New India
 iske liye avasanrachana, digital arthvyavastha or laghu or madhyam companiyon main rojgaar srijan ke liye baari nivesh kii jarurat he
 The vision for the next decade is mentioned in the budget, which will focus on building physical and social infrastructure, Make in India, MSME, start-ups, defense manufacturing, automobiles, batteries, medical equipment, development and employment generation
 Focus will be on 5 trillian dollar kii iconomi par focusvitt mantri ne kaha ki is vitt varsh main hi bharat kii arthvyavastha kaa aakaar 3 trillian dollar kaa ho jayega
 2 at the moment
 7 trillian dollar kaa he
 India's economy had grown to $ 1 trillion in 55 years
 pichley paanch saal main hi sarkaar ne iskaa aakaar 1 trillian yani ek trillian dollar badha diya he
 India made its economy 1 in 5 years
 85 trillian dollar se 2
 75 trillion dollars
 lekin prati vyakti aay main ummid se behad kam ijapha hua he
 Per capita income is a matter of concern, according to data from the International Monetary Fund, in 2018, India was ranked 142 in the world in terms of per capita income
 2014 main bharat prati vyakti aay ke maamle main duniya main 169 wein number par tha
 In 2018, countries like Ghana, Nigeria, Nicaragua, Sri Lanka were ahead of India in terms of per capita income
 bada sawaal yah he ki jab iconomi kaa sies badhata he to kya aam aadmi kii aamadani badhati he
 1 in 2014 85 trillian dollar kii arthvyavastha 5 saal main 2
 7 trillion dollar level has been reached
 aise main agle kuch saalon main 5 trillian dollar ke lakshya tak pahunchane kii bharat main kshamta he
 Let me tell you that India is currently the sixth largest economy in the world
 bharat se aage america, china, japan, germany or britain hai
 GDP is not paying as well, in 2017 India had overtaken France to number six
 is saal bharat britain ko peeche chhodkar 5wein number par aa jayega
 America, China and Japan are currently in the club with a $ 5 trillion economy
 lekin is club main janaa itnaa aasaan nahin he
 The Economic Survey states that India has to reach this target by 2025, while India is currently growing at a growth rate of around 7 percent
 pichley saal to ye or ghatakar 6
 It remained at 8 percent
 bajet se pehle aarthik surveykshan main vikaas dar 7 fisadi hi rahane kaa anumaan rakhaa gaya he, or agar 5 trillian dollar kii arthvyavastha bananaa he, to prativarsh 8 pratishat kaa vikaas dar chahie
 How to achieve the target of $ 5 trillion? However, the growth rate of 8 percent will also be less, because on average we need a growth rate of 11 and a half percent
 tab ham 5 trillian tak pahunch paaenge
 But the Finance Minister told in the budget how to reach the target of $ 5 trillion, it was told that this year India will become a country with economy of $ 3 trillion
 -aage infrastracchar, digital india or chote udyogon main nivesh karne kii jarurat he
 Work is being done to invest Rs 100 lakh crore for infrastructure in 5 years
 sarkaar agle 5 saal main 80 hajaar karod rupee sadakon ko apgrade karne main lagaaegi
 70 thousand crore rupees will be given to overcome the problems of banking sector
 saamaajik kshetra main sarkaar kii yojanaon se aa rahe bade badlaav se phayda mila he
 It is said that money makes money
 paise se naukariyaan banati hai, samruddhi aati he
 a $ 5 trillion economy means we stand with countries like the US, China and Japan, which are seen as super powers for their prosperity

 '' dilli main badhate pradooshan ko dekhte hue ab usase ladane kii koshishen bhi tej ho gai hai
 The South MCD gave the company named Van Infra the responsibility of conducting a survey in Delhi, whose job would be to collect information about trucks coming to Delhi which are not used in Delhi
 ye vah trek hai jo duusare rajyon main jane ke liye dilli se hokar jate hai
 This survey started at midnight, whose exclusive pictures have been captured by 'aaj Tak' in its camera
 vaan inphra kii team raat 12 baje gajipur toll booth par apni team ke saath survey shuru kiya
 During this time, three hi-tech night vision cameras were also installed for video recording of the entire survey, this survey will run for 24 hours
 team ke sadsy trek chaalkon se unki bilti jaanchate hai, jisase pataa chal sake ki trek ko saamaan kahaan utaarna he
 This gives information that Kitrak is working in Delhi or outside Delhi
 survey ke dauraan team ke sadsy sari jaankaree ek form main bharte jate hai
 The information that is filled in the form includes the number of the truck, what the goods are in the truck, the weight of the goods, whether the truck driver has paid ECC or not
 lekin sabase zyaada zaruri jaankaree hoti he ki trek kahaan se maal lekar aa rahaa he or usemaal kii delaverikahan deni he, is survey kii jaankaree south emsidi ko bheji jaaegi
 It will be easy to find out how many such trucks are working in Delhi and how many such trucks are going through Delhi which are not in Delhi but in neighboring states

 All the organizations working for the environment have attributed these trucks to the increasing pollution in Delhi as most of these trucks are very old and cause more pollution
 haalanki aise trakon ko dilli main daakhil hone se rokane ke liye dilli ke bahari hisse main western or eastern peripheral hive banane kaa kaam chal to rahaa he lekin uski sust raftaar kaa khamiyaaza dilli waalon ko bhugatna pad rahaa he

 Omar Abdullah also retaliated on this

 input-ians With the Narendra Modi wave, BJP managed to touch the charismatic figures in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, but more than that, this wave has hurt the abominable nature of casteism in both the states
 jaat or jamaat ke naam par bante in donon pradesh ke log aisa karenge yah kisi ne nahin sochaa tha
 The figures of seats won by the BJP are a witness to the fact that caste politics has suffered tremendously after almost four decades in these two states
 1977 ke chunaav main hamane dekha tha ki in rajyon se jati kii raajnneeti hawa ho gai thi
 But after that the same situation happened again
 ab is baar donon rajyon main janata ne jativaadee takaton par jabardast prahaar kiya he or narendra modi kii sarkaar banane main madad kii
 While in Bihar, Lalu Yadav had faith in his MY equation, Nitish Kumar also had expectations from the caste equation
 lekin jis tarah se nattejey aae usase sabhi hairaan ho gaye
 Not only did the BJP get the vote of all the upper castes, but a large number of backward castes supported it
 iskaa ek hi kaaran samaj main aata he ki nae yuva voter jati se upar uthakar soch rahe hai
 They are thinking of employment and economic development
 bihar main jatiyon ke bich kitna vaimnasy he, yah sabhi jaanate hai or rajaneta uskaa apane phaayde ke liye jamkar istemaal karte hai lekin is baar aisa nahin hua
 This also applies to Uttar Pradesh where the basis of caste politics has been lost
 lalu prasad kii tarah mulaayam singh yadav bhi apane emwai sameekaran par ummiden lagaae baithe the
 But they too have suffered a setback
 lekin hairaan to kiya daliton ne jinhone bhi bijepi ko bade paimaane par vot diya jiskaa nateeja bispi bhugat rahi he
 Mayawati's party became clear in the Lok Sabha elections
 zaahir he ki dalit yuvak-yuvatiyon ne jati ke upar vikaas ko tarjeeh di
 He too felt that there should be no objection to giving Modi a chance
 jati kii sankeern raajnneeti main duube hue in rajyon se ye chunaav parinaam sawan ke bayaar kii tarah hai jo desh ko ek disha dete dikh rahe hai
 Now we have to see how much Modi and his government live up to the expectations of those who break the chains of caste, because if this is not done then this dragon of casteism will hold us again

 They are not getting as much money as they wanted

 Former International Cricket Council President Ehsan Mani has condemned BCCI President Anurag Thakur for making a 'provocative' statement on Pakistan and asked the PCB to pressurize India not to host ICC tournaments
 mani ne kaha ki pakistani cricket adhikariyon ko agle saptaah capatoun main isisi kaaryakari board kii baithak main kadaa rukh akhriyaar karnaa chahie
 "the President of the Board of Cricket has given provocative and immature statements to give Pakistan an opportunity to present itself effectively in the ICC meeting," he said
 mani ne kaha ki pakistani pratinidhimandal ko maang kerani chahie ki isisi pakistan ke khilaaf bayaanbaji ko lekar bisisiai adhyaksh se safai maange
 He said, Anurag Thakur is a politician and also an MP of the ruling party
 isisi ko unase poochna chahie ki pakistan yaa anya cricket masalon par bayaan unhone kis haisiyat se die hai
 The ICC constitution clearly states that no officer or member of the country will make such a statement that would hurt the reputation of the game and Thakur's statements have done so
 mani ne kaha ki vah pichley do saal se pakistan board ko salaah de rahe hai ki isisi toornamenton main group charan main bharat ke khilaaf nahin khelen
 He said, now India is talking about not playing with us in the group stage of ICC tournaments
 sach to yah he ki bharat pakistan maichon se isisi ko baari kamai hoti he or big thri sanchaalan formule ke tahat bharat ko iskaa bada hissaa miltaa he
 Despite this, they do not want to play bilateral series with us
 mani ne kaha ki pakistani cricket adhikari barason se bharat ko khush rakhane kii niti par amal kar rahe hai kyonki ve dwipaksheeya cricket kii bahaali chaahate hai
 The comments unhone kaha, lekin ab yah saaf he ki bhartiya cricket board kii taraf se kaaphi nakaaratmakataa he or halaat bhi tanaavpurn hai

 The ICC should ask them in what capacity they have made statements on Pakistan or other cricket issues

 Mani said that he has been advising the Pakistan Board for the last two years not to play against India in the group stage in ICC tournaments
 unhone kaha, ab bharat isisi toornamenton ke group charan main hamaare saath nahin khilne kii baat kah rahaa he
 The truth is that ICC earns a lot from india-pakistan matches and India gets a big part of it under the Big Three operating formula

 Rangoli tweeted and wrote that 'these non-indian people who are living on our earth and using people and means and abusing them

 This is the time to think about their agenda and stay away from their instigation
 'these non Indians who are living off this land, using and abusing its people and its resources, lying about intolerance and spreading hatred, time to think about their agenda and not to get carried away with their provocations

If i feel anything, when will i talk about her, when i will die? It is worth mentioning that sometime back, Rangoli had accused the Bhatt family and made a controversial statement about Mahesh Bhatt
 unhone varisht filmmekar par aarope lagaate hue daawa kiya tha ki mahesh bhatta ne kangana ranut ko chappal phenkakar maaraa tha
 However, Mahesh Bhatt had said on these allegations that Kangana is still a child

 pehali kahani he karan johar kii, jo aadhaarit he samalangikta par
 The second story is of Dibakar Banerjee, the story of a theater artist looking for work
 teesri film he joya akhtar kii, jisamen kahani he ek bachche kii, jise ladakiyon kii tarah kapade pahanakar dance karnaa acha lagata he or vah bada hokar katrina caff kii tarah dancer bananaa chahta he
 And the fourth story is of Anurag Kashyap, which tells about Amitabh Bachchan's fan
 tippaniyan All the four stories in the film are different from each other, which seems to be made for multiplex audiences
 chaaron kahaniyaan experimental hai, jo aam aadmi kii samaj se dur hai
 All directors have experimented fiercely
 ho saktaa he ki alag-alag logon ko in main se alag-alag kahaniyaan pasand aaen
 There may be laughter at some places in the film, but the film lacks entertainment value
 'bombai tokies' jab se ban rahi thi, tabhi se ise bollywood ke 100 saal kaa tribut bataakar pramot kiya jaataa rahaa, lekin asal tribut sirf ek gane main he, jo film ke khatm hone ke baad aata he
 The song is based on Bollywood and many stars have shown their glimpses in this song
 filmkaaron kii shaayad asal koshish yah bataane ki he ki bollywood ke 100 saal puraa hone tak ham itane badal gaye hai or itane experimental ho gaye hai ki hamaara experiment aam darshakon kii samaj se dur he, isliye 'bombai tokies' ke liye meri reating he 2
