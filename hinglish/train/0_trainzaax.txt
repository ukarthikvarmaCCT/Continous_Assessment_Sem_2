 View this post on instagrama film that was born in my heart and mind 15 years ago
 
 
 
 a film i passionately believe in
 
 
 the last film my father worked on before he left us
 
 
 
 it was his dream to see this film come through
 
 
 
 i couldn’t fulfil his dream then
 
 
 
 my spirit was broken
 
 
 
 but today his wish has found a relationship with celluloid
 
 
 
 the story of turbulent relationships and eternal love has found a voice
 
 
 
 the film has been woven,nurtured and visualised by ABHISHEK VARMAN
 
 
 
 and the film Is KALANK! Set in the 40’s but it’s heart lives on
 
 
 
 
 TOMORROW the journey begins
 
 
 
 
 am excited 
 
 
 anxious and emotional about this one
 
 
 i do hope you join us on our path to undying love

 59 crore person days of employment were created, which decreased to 216 in 2011-12
 34 karod vyakti din rah gaya
 Apart from this, there was also a significant decline in the pace of completion of work
 sansad main aaj pesh report main kaha gaya he, mantralay dwaara dhan jari karne kii manjuuri ke maamle main kai prakaar kii khamiyaan milin
 Many such cases came up while the Ministry released grants more than the demand
 report main kaha gaya he ki 2010-11 main vastav main mantralay ne dhan jari karne sambandhi sabhi sharton (sirf istemaal ke praaanpatr ko chhodkar) main dheel di

 West Indies won the last series against India in 2006
 westeindies ne apane gharelu maidan par bharat ko paanch maichon kii siries main 4-1 se haraaya tha
 The good news for India is that while the West Indies batsman Chris Gayle is not playing in the ODI series due to injury, the Caribbean Board, in order to save the highly successful spin bowler Sunil Naren in the IPL, from the charge of suspected bowling action
 Kept away from the series
 bharat kii taraf se bhi haalanki salaami ballebaaj rohit sharma kaa ekadivasiy shrunkhlaa main khelnaa sandigdh hi he
 Ajinkya Rahane, who started the innings with Shikhar Dhawan in the absence of Rohit in England, can be sent to start the innings in this series as well

 The Aam Aadmi Party is the party of the movement, the party of the street
 ye baat party sanyojak arvind kejariwal samet tamaam aalaa netaa kai baar or kai manchon se kehete aae hai
 The AAP, which has been calling for democracy in the party, had created a fierce battle for the last three days but has it come to an end? Party MLA Amanatullah Khan called Kumar Vishwas, a founding member of AAP and friend of Kejriwal, an 'agent of BJP'
 uske baad to jaise kumaar ne khan kosbak sikhaane kii jidthan lee
 Alleging infiltration of outsiders in the party, Kumar refused to join the party's highest platform PAC
 yahaan tak kii saarvajanik rup se khan par kisi 'duusare' ke ishaare par bayaanbaji karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Seeing Kumar's displeasure, the party showed Khan a way out of the PAC
 pehle garmi phir narmi!kumaar vishwaas ko jabaav dene kaa jimmaa dilli ke upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne sambhala or unhen party manch par aakar apni baat kehane kii naseehat de daali
 Then it was felt that now Kumar is difficult to stay in the party and he can leave the party
 lekin shaam hote-hote hawa kaa rukh badla or khud arvind kejariwal, manish sisodiya ke saath kumaar ko manaane unke ghar pahunche
 Then after Kejriwal went to his house with Kumar there was a meeting of top leaders till late night
 aakhir main amanatulla khan ko party se suspend kar diya gaya or kumaar ko rajasthan main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav kaa prabharee banaaya gaya
 Kumar Vishwas was also giving similar statements on the public platform by Amanatullah Khan
 lekin sajaa sirf khan ko hui kumaar ko to ek nai jimmedaari dekar unka kad or badha diya gaya
 How can Kumar be rewarded for the irresponsible behavior in which Khan was punished in the height of Kumar's stature
 kumaar par karrwai isliye nahin kii gai kyonki wo andolan ke vakt se party se jude hai yaa isaki kuch or vajah he
 Of course, Kumar's stature in the party is very large and he is considered the leader of number three
 lekin khud ko loktantric party kehane vaali AAP ne yahaan barabari kaa vyavhaar kyon nahin kiya
 Kumar Vishwas has been accused of taking the line against the party earlier also
 deshbhakti vaale unke taaja video ne soshal media main khub surkhiyaan batori, jisamen wo vipakshi netaaon samet arvind kejariwal par nishaanaa sadhate najar aae
 During the assembly elections, he did not even go out to campaign for the party, but why did the party bow to him
 amanatulla khan par karrwai ke baad aalaa netaaon kaa jo photo media main aayaa usamen kumaar ke chehre kaa gussa saaf dekha ja saktaa he
 While all the leaders are seen smiling and photographed, there is a different kind of anger on Kumar's face
 vah pehle hi kah chuke hai ki khan ne jo tippanee unpar kii, agar wo arvind yaa manish ke khilaaf kii jaati to kya amanatulla khan party main rah pate
 Clearly, the party has now taken action on Khan and has expressed that Kumar is more important to him

 Because in such a situation Pakistan's run rate will be less than the run rate of New Zealand and Pakistan's dream of reaching the semi-finals will remain incomplete
 vahiin, bangladesh ke khilaaf toss jitkar pakistan kii team agar pehle ballebaaji chunati he to use balle se dam dikhaate hue 350 ran bananaa hoga
 After this, Bangladesh will have to be defeated by a big margin of 311 runs while bowling the most dangerous in the history of World Cup
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki agar pakistan pehle ballebaaji karte hue 50 over main 350 ran banaata he to use bangladesh kii team ko 39 ran par olout karnaa hoga
 Please tell that Bangladesh's team has already been eliminated from the World Cup

 court ne paaya ki dilli main mahilaon kii suraksha ko lekar na hi pichhali sarkaar or na hi maujuuda sarkaar gambhir najar aati he
 The High Court said this while hearing a petition for protection of women in Delhi after the Nirbhaya gang rape
 court ne kaha ki aisa lagata he jaise centre sarkaar kii na hi dilli mencisitivi camerailgane main or na hi dilli police main nai bhartiyon karne main koi dilchaspee he
 The court said that the condition is that women in Delhi do not feel safe after 7 pm alone
 dilli ke logon or mahilaon kii suraksha kii centresarkaar ko phikr nahin he
 The court said that the Union Home Ministry (MHA) has approved 14 thousand new recruitments in the Delhi Police, but the Expenditure dept has imposed a stance saying that the government does not have that much money to spend
 aisa kaise ho saktaa he kii MHA kii manjuuri ke baad bhi doosraa vibhaag bhartee par roak laga de
 The court said that all the ministers of the central government sit in Delhi, yet nobody pays attention to it
 court ne kaha, 'dilli main hi sabhi netaaon ke bethane ke baad bhi dilli ke saath sautela vyavhaar kar rahi he centre sarkaar
 The High Court has asked the Delhi Police and the Delhi Government to briefly brief the court orders regarding the safety of women in Delhi, which has not yet been followed by the Central Government

 Arun Shourie's new book ja hi no a madars heart? haau safaring rifutes religens aapke saamne vikalp rakhti he
 You can pretend that it does not exist, or you can suffer
 ham kismat ke aage kaayar hote hai, khaskar ve khushnaseeb log jo saamaanya halaat main laharaate phirte hai; ham samvedansheeltaa ko udaseenta kii chadar se dhak dete hai
 Shourie shrugs the protective shield of the same indifferent indifference to a question of existentialism: who is the God of injustice? Who creates such a gene that makes a innocent person's life distorted forever? Who destroys the world due to the earthquake or tsunami that is happening for a large number of people? Death is the law of life; What is the point of sudden death, or sesame death, mercilessness, cruelty, endless pain, long life-wasting illness? Shorey goes through the pain of his wife Anita's anguish, bypassing her trouble
 unki khubsuurati ek chota tathy haih yah kitaab aanshik rup se unke charitra, himmat or sabase badhkar unke pyaar kii daastaan he or in sabko durbhaagya ne trast kar rakhaa he
 He has a spastic son Adit, who is now 35 years old but is living a life beyond time
 bachche or mata-pita ke bich lagaav kii koi seemaa nahin hoti, unke bich lagbhag aadhyatmik, pyaar hota he; or agar isaki keemat kisi bahari vyakti ke boote ke baahar hoti he to arun, anitha or adit ke dil kis had tak bujh chuke honge?adit ke ang asahaay hai; lekin uske armaan hai, vah jindadil insaan he
 So, if you have courage, then answer Shourie's anger: "he (adit) loves everyone
" parivaar ke sabhi log usase pyaar karte hai
 Her grandmother, Malti Shukla, used to be her life
 vah hamaari jindagi he

 Christianity believes that this world is the result of crime and punishment
 aadam or hauva ne ishwar kii nafarmani kii, jananath se nikaale gaye or unhone is swechhachari duniya ko paala-posa
 But who is responsible for punishing the crime or crime not committed? Adam cursed all of us with his deadly move to commit real crime with real innocence
 lekin kya ishwar ne insaani jindagi ke liye is tark ko khaarij kar diya he? gunahagaar logon ko hansate hue jindagi basar karne kaa vardaan kyon mil jaataa he? aadam kii aulad ne dojakh ke dar se gunaah karne se kab gurej kiya he? koun-sa mat duniya main ek maasoom ke liye dojakh kii baat karata he?islam anantkaal main insaaf kaa vaada karata he, jab allaah jindagi se maut tak faili in ninsafiyon ko dur karegaa
 Only atheists believe in death; For a Muslim, death is a pause in the continuation of life
 maut ke bare main 
 The verse of the Quran is very simple: We come from Allah, we go to Allah
 lekin kya koi ugr sudhaarwadi ruh qayaamat ke din shaayad khud se ek yaa do sawaal poochhegi? mullah ne use allaah se darane ke liye kaha he, sufi ne usase daivineta ko gale lagane ke liye kaha haih spastic ko kya karnaa chahie?hindu darshan thodaa or pechida he

 It is being told that to suppress the matter, Kapil Sharma got his girlfriend introduced to everyone
 haalanki is prayaas main vah safal nahin rahe or sunil se unki ladaai kaa maamla bada ban hi gaya
 Also because Sunil has since made up his mind to leave Kapil Sharma's show

 manzil kitni bhi dur or raste kitne bhi dushwaar hon, lekin aapke bheetar agar junun he to raste tay karne ke liye jajba bhi saath chalata rahata he
 One such example of passion and passion is Anil Sarin, CEO of Stanford Cricket Industries in Meerut district in Uttar Pradesh, which is known worldwide for its innovation in the cricket industry
 duniya kaa shaayad hi koi aisa star cricketer ho jo unase yaa unke esef brand ke utpaadon se parichit na ho
 Today he is second in the world in preparing and presenting cricket goods according to time and need
 pichley 20 saal main sareen ne cricket kii duniya kii demand ko samajha or vah sab kuch diya, jisaki purti england kii cricket industry bhi nahin kar pai thi
 But why is the name Stanford working in Meerut? Stanford University is in California, USA
 bakaul sareen, ''november 1997 main yahi sochakar unhone apni company kaa naam ''stenford" rakhaa ki ise duniya main naam dilaanaa he
 "he got so much love from Stanford that he even named his brand its shortened form SF
 ve cricket kii gend banane kii takanic main maahir hai
 Initially he focused on his expertise
 tab handmad ledar ball aati thim, lekin sareen ne pehla krantikari badlaav isi myne main kiya
 He brought a hydraulic machine to make the ball's leather cup
 ab chunauti thi gend ko ''dishape" yani use kharaab hone se bachaana
 For this, he bought expensive formula from an engineer and made machines based on it
 ledar takanic par research kiya
 Brought ideas and formula from England
 gend ke bheetar daalaa jane vaala gola cork kaa hota tha jis par dhaage lapete jate the
 These threads were also sourced from South Africa
 nateeja behad utsahjanak rahaa
 The ball that was "dished" in 10 overs is no longer in 100 overs
 aaj stenford ledar kii tu-pis or four pis ball banaati he
 The two-piece ball is similar to Australia's brand "kukabura"
 ''kukabura" ball kii keemat 3,500 ru
 And the "stanford" ball costs Rs 700
 he
 Then, in 2003, Stanford Industries introduced its bat, which today has 12 profiles
 bat ke handle or blade par prayog kiye gaye
 The "V" shape of the handle and blade won the challenge of uniform cutting from the machines
 bat ke alag-alag aakaar kii software profile taiyaar karai
 "V" cutting machine, profile machines imported from Australia
 is tarah har desh or har khilaadi kii vyaktigat pasand ke hisaab se bat pesh kiye
 The standard weight of a bat is 1,140 grams to 1,200 grams
 sachin tendulkar or mahendra singh dhoni 1,280 gram vajan ke bat se khelte hai, is demand ko bhi stenford industries ne puraa kiya
 Prior to founding "SF" in 1997, Sarin worked with his elder brother's company SS (sarin Sports) formed in 1971 and received Rs 6,000
 maheenaa vetan miltaa tha
 In it his father Madanlal Sarin and elder brother Ann
 ke
 Half of Sarin's capital was invested
 anil kii shaadi hui to jimmedaari badi, unhone alag hone kaa jokhim uthaaya
 The father paid him Rs 3 lakh
 or ek plot diya
 Anil says, "I told my wife Reema that i was five thousand rupees
" maheenaa to har haal main kama luungaa, kya tum guzaara kar logi?" patni ke ''haa" kehane par unhone apni factory shuru kii or ''esef" brand kii cricket ball banani shuru kii
 Then requested to purchase from SS itself
 eses ne 30 fisadi chhot maangi, jabaki gend par margin hi 5 fisadi tha
 The business between the two did not last more than six months
 eses industries se alag hokar sareen san 2000 main meerut ke hi sachdeva sports se 20,000 ru
 Borrowed and went to England
 ve cricket ke kaarobaar main mashhoor deukes cricket company ke baahar garden main baithe rahete the
 The results were shocking when i met Dukes Cricket owner Dilip Jhinjoria after a ten-day wait
 unase ball niryaat ke liye 20 lakh ru
 An order was received, but when Sarin clearly said that i do not have such a status, Jhinjoria is happy with this honest answer and Rs
 5-5 lakhs
 kaa order de diya
 Sarin went to South Africa in 2005 and expanded the business there
 2004 main ''esef" ne anil kumble ko pehle cricketer ke rup main sin kiya
 After this, the company signed agreements with bowler Mohit Sharma and Sri Lanka's Arvind d'silva
 sareen sachin tendulkar se judaa ek kissa sunaate hai, ''sachin ko maine 8-10 bat banaakar die, lekin unhone sabamein kuch na kuch kami nikaal di
 Then i was inspired to try something new
 "mauka 2013 main ipiel kaa tha
 Tendulkar stayed in a hotel in Delhi and Sarin took four bats there
 saath main bat ko taraashne vaale karigar bhi the
 He says, "in the hotel room, we started grooming bats according to Sachin, after hours of hard work, Sachin liked all four bats
 " phir sachin tendulkar kii madad se bisisiai se bhi order milane shuru hue
 Sarin started the business with just 25 employees
 aaj unki company main 200 karmchaaree kaam karte hai
 Today, in place of tinshed factory, we make cricket goods in three places
 pita se mili 3 lakh ru
 The industry, which started from Rs
 10 crore today
 kii he
 Stanford Industries today is about 15 crores
 salanaa kaa niryaat karti he jo kul bikri kaa 50 fisadi he
 The company has a long list of brand ambassadors, including Ian Morgan, Dwayne Smith, Tom Ellsop, Gary Wilson, Ashar Zaidi, Mahela Jayawardene, Dinesh Chandimal
 aedidas or emref jaisi multinational companiyaan bhi esef se bat lekar apni tanging kar pryojit tiimon ko uplabdh karaati hai
 Now a new generation of sarin has also arrived
 do saal se betaa rachit kaam kar rahaa he
 Rachit has an MBA from England
 philhal cricket bat main ''esef" brand kii nau range market main hai
 These are for players from 4 feet to 6 feet tall
 inamen chote or lambey handle vaale bat bhi hai
 From batting pads, wicket-keeping legguards, thy pads, elbow guards, chest guards, elbow guards, wicket-keeping gloves, wickets, hats and helmets, the company manufactures everything that cricket needs
 2005 se lagaataar stenford ko sports, guds export promoshan council se niryaat ke liye puruskaar mil rahe hai
 At Stanford Industries, 700 balls and 250 bats are made daily
 inke bat kaa mukhya sies 33

 5 inch kaa hota he
 Stanford's Bat Rs 4,000

 kaatil use murda samaj kar ghar se nikal chuke the par uski chand saansen ab bhi baaki thim
 He was still alive but he knew that now he was going to die just any moment
 kabhi bhi uski saansen uskaa sach chhod dengi
 Sir was attached to the torso with great difficulty
 ek haath jism se alag ho chukaa tha, ungliyaan cat chuki thim par phir bhi usne himmat nahin haari
 He exerted all his strength for one last time before dying
 bachi-khuchi ungaliyon main se ek ungali ko kisi tarah apane hi khun me duboya or diwaar par ye das shabd likh daale
 He wrote ten words on the wall of the house not with red ink, but with his own blood, and after writing ten words, he died
 ghar main chaaron taraf bikhare khun ke dhabbe is baat ke gavaah hai ki kitni berahami ke saath uskaa khun kiya gaya
 It can be guessed that even the murderer himself did not have the slightest hope that after his attack, he would live a few seconds more and that is why he considered him dead and left the place and here the killer made a mistake because what he considered a dead house Left from
 
 There was still some life left in that dead body
 dard kii shiddat kaa andaja lagaaie
 One hand was separated from him
 ungliyaan kati hui thim
 There was a deep attack between the head and the torso
 khun lagaataar bah rahaa tha
 Rongte stands up just thinking, but she did not lose the snow
 usne kisi tarah apni tamaam aakhri saanson ko sameta or apni isi ungali ko apane khun main dubo kar diwaar par kul das shabd likhe
 Nine words on one wall and tenth on another wall
 koun hai ye murali or mani? kya dushmani thi unki makatool se? kyon maaraa unhon use? or kya sachmuch aakhri saanson se likhi gai is ibaarat me kaatil kaa hi naam chupa he? qatl kii is dil dahala dene vaali kahani kaa puraa sach jaanane ke liye pehle puri kahani sun lijie
 He himself had realized that his parents would not be able to support him until his father returned home
 vakt itnaa bhi nahin bachaa tha ki kaagaj ke tukade par kuch likh paata
 So he had nothing but his own blood to write the name of his murderer
 dil dahala dene vaali ye vaardaat yamunanagar railway colony ke makaan number e-1 main buudhvaar raat ko hui
 In this house Amit lived with his parents, two brothers and sister-in-law, on Wednesday there was a relative's marriage in the area
 puraa parivaar usee shaadi main gaya hua tha
 Amit, the eldest son of the house, was left alone at home
 isi bich der raat achaanak kuch padosiyon ne dekha ki amit ke ghar ke daravaje ke neeche se khun ris rahaa he
 Neighbors got scared after seeing blood
 pehle unhen laga ki shaayad ghar me kisi ko chot lag gai ho
 So when they opened the door, the door was opened from inside, but as soon as they entered, their screams came out
 puure ghar main khun hi khun tha or jameen par padi thi amit kii khun se lathpath laash
 The mangers of the house were telling that the murderers tortured Amit a lot before killing him because blood was spread in every part of the house
 kichan, dringroom, bedroom har taraf khun hi khun tha
 It seemed that the murderer did not want to leave Amit alive at any cost
 isi bich police or gharavaalon kii najar diwaar par likhe das shabdon par padi
 The housemates were shocked as soon as they read the name
 amit ke mamaa ke mutabik ghar kii diwaar par khun se likhi ibaarat main ek naam amit ke bade bhai ke ek dost kaa he
 According to the family members, Amit's murderers scattered the contents of the house here and there to mislead the police
 ghar kii sari almariyaan khuli huin thim lekin ghar se koi bhi keemtee saamaan gaayab nahin tha
 Surprisingly, such a big incident took place in the house and the neighbors did not even get to know it, nor did they see anyone coming inside the house before or after the murder
 itnaa hi nahin kisi ne amit ke cheekhney-chillane kii awaz tak nahin suni
 26-year-old Amit was the youngest of the house
 wo ek praivet company main naukari kar rahaa tha
 According to neighbors, Amit was a very quiet and sociable boy
 ghar main sabase chota hone ke kaaran vah apane pita kaa bhi laadla tha lekin amit kii maut ne unhen tod kar rakh diya he
 According to the police, it is certain that Amit knew his killers because the door of the house has not been broken
 yani amit apane qatilon ko pahachaanata tha or usee ne daravaaza khol kar unhen andar bulaayaa
 At present, the police have two most important names in the name of clues which Amit himself has written on the wall with his blood
 ab dekhnaa ye he ki wo in naam tak kab pahunchati he or kya vaaki gaye donon naam amit ke kaatilon ke hi hai? US Health Minister Tom Price has resigned from his post

 *** abhinetri kangana ranavat ne film production company tii-series ko legal notice bheja he
 Kangana has stated in the notice that the T-series is releasing the film 'I Love New York' without her permission
 kangana ne is film kii release ko rokane kii maang kii he
 At the same time, Bhushan Kumar, the owner of T-series, gave a befitting reply to Kangana, saying that no actor is needed to release the film
 darasal, sani deol or kangana ranavat starer film 'ai lav neuyork' pichley 6 saalon se bakse main band he
 An attempt was made to release it 2 years ago, which was also press conference
 isamen kangana or sani deol shaamil bhi hue the magar kinhi vajahon se film release nahin ho saki
 Now preparations are on to release this film once again
 isaki khabar milte hi kangana tilamila uthi hai kyonki unhen lagata he kii bhushan kumaar unke naam kaa faaydaa uthaa rahe hai
 Kangana's lawyer Rizwan Siddiqui stated that "it is very strange that the film is being released without the permission of our client Kangana
" unhone yahaan tak kii prachaar ke liye bhi nahin bulaayaa
 For 6 years the film was boxed in because it was not fit to release but the T-series is trying to cash in on Kangana's fame
 '' Rizwan also said that "kangana was promised that the film would not be released but now the T-series is breaking its promise
" ye film kangana kii image karaab karegi
 "it is also stated in the notice that Kangana did not get the money for this film and the copy of the agreement was not given
 " On the other hand, Bhushan Kumar, the owner of T-series said, "now we do not have the right over the film, because we sold our rights to Wave Cinema 18 months ago
 rahi baat kangana kii ijazat kii to film release karne ke liye kisi actor kii anumati lene kii zarurat nahin hoti, jab tak kii wo actor intelexual property rhit kaa sadsy na ho
 Therefore, Kangana does not need permission
 rahi baat paison kii to main unke notice kaa jawaab dene ja rahaa hum, jisamen check kii ditels bhi hongi kii unhen kab-kab or kitne paise die ja chuke hai
 The entire payment has been made by check and a check of Rs 10 lakh was given as the last remuneration for dubbing the film
 kangana ke agreement kii copy bhi mere paas he
 If she forgot, she should have asked for us
 ''tippaniyan Actually after the success of the film "queen" and "tanu Weds Manu Returns", Kangana stars are on a high and in such a situation, the stalled film 'I Love New York' is being released so that the film can get some money dipped
 
 vahiin, kangana ko bhi yahi dukh sata rahaa he ki unki shoharat kaa faaydaa koi or uthaane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 There is nothing wrong in this because the producer will try to withdraw his money
 magar kangana ko ye sochna chahie ki gine-chune hero ke alaava kisi hero yaa heroin kii shoharat ke bina par film nahin chalati
 When the film is good, it only plays
 agar kangana kii shoharat par film kaamyaab hoti to "queen" kii apaar safalata ke baad unki film "revolver rani" or 'ungali' release hui thi or ye donon hi filmein bahut badi flop hui thim
 Actually, Sunny Deol and Kangana Ranaut starrer film 'I Love New York' has been in the box for the last 6 years
 2 saal pehle ise release karne kii koshish kii gai thi, jisaki press conferes bhi kii gai thi
 Kangana and Sunny Deol were also involved in this but due to some reasons the film could not be released
 ab ek baar phir is film ko release karne kii taiyaari chal rahi he
 As soon as we get the news of this, Kangana Daze has arisen because she feels that Bhushan Kumar is taking advantage of her name
 kangana ke vakil rigwaan siddiqi ne kaha kii "ye bada ajeeb he kii hamaari client kangana kii ijazat ke bina film ko release kiya ja rahaa he
 He did not even call for publicity

 At the same time, Kangana is also suffering the same sorrow that someone else is trying to take advantage of her fame

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav was scheduled to inaugurate the Bajaj power plant located in Lalitpur district on September 20, but before that the Congress started agitating, raising a question mark over the power plant
 andolan kaa netritv purv kendriya gramin vikaas rajyamantri pradeep jain aditya kar rahe the
 Their issues were such that thousands of people stood together
 masalan, jile main ban rahi bijli kaa laabh pehle jile ko mili, sthaneey logon ko vahaan rojgaar diya jaae
 On 14 September, agitators surrounded the power plant
 achaanak prashasan kii neend tuuti
 Officers arrived at the opportunity, opened the box of assurances and pacified the movement
 lekin unke sawaal to vaazib hai
 In the district where electricity is produced from water, coal and solar energy, people of that district have to spend twelve hours a day without electricity
 yahaan panbizli se 75 megawatt bijli kaa utpaadan ho rahaa he, solar power planton se 30 megawatt bijli ban rahi he or ab pradesh ke sabase bade thermal power planton main se ek bajaj power plant ne bhi bijli kaa utpaadan shuru kar diya he
 Yet the city remains shrouded in darkness
 darasal, puure bundelkhand kii yahi traasadee he
 Two years ago, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav announced to make Bundelkhand the largest energy hub of the state and to set up new industrial units
 ghoshnaaen to puri huin, lekin andhera jas kaa tas kaayam rahaa
 The Bajaj Power Plant with a capacity of 1980 MW located in Chiglaua village of Lalitpur was approved during Mayawati government
 ab yah banakar taiyaar ho gaya he
 The production capacity of the plant remained the same in these days, but the cost increased to one and a half times
 uttar pradesh sarkaar se hue qaraar ke mutabik, bajaj power plant ko kareeb 10,000 karod ru
 The project was to be ready by March 2015 with a cost of Rs
 600, which is now in a position to commission only one unit of 600 MW in 2016
 laagat 16,000 karod ru
 Has reached across haal hi main plant ne 600 megawatt kii ek ikai shuru kii he
 But the big question is that the power that will be produced here will go where it is because the transmission line is not even built
 power plant ke adhikari kisi sawaal kaa jawaab nahin dete
 Rajiv Srivastava, Deputy General Manager, Lalitpur Power Generation Company, says, "it is not possible to send electricity to the grid due to lack of transmission lines
" transmishan line nikaalane ke liye rajya sarkaar ne samay par tender jari nahin kiya
 It has nothing to do with the plant
 '' line na banane kaa nateeja yah hua ki ek unit ko kuch din chalaae jane ke baad ise band karne kii naubat aa gai
 The power being prepared was not being sent to the grid and the Lalitpur sub-stations are not in a position to take more than 150 to 200 MW
 jis gaanv main yah power plant he, vahaan logon ko 12 ghante bhi bijli naseeb nahin hoti
 This is the condition of the whole of Bundelkhand
 isi ke khilaaf purv kendriya gramin vikaas rajyamantri pradeep jain ke netritv main andolankariyon ne bajaj power plant kaa gheraav kiya
 Jain has also announced a big movement for the rights of farmers
 ve kehete hai, ''jo plant 10,000 karod ru
 It was to be ready in India, its cost suddenly increased to Rs 16,000 crore
 ke paar kaise pahunch gai? isamen bade paimaane par bhrashtachar hua he
 It should have a CAG audit
 '' jaahir he ki plant kii laagat badhegi to janata par boj badhegaa
 Says Jain, "the power plant with the state government has sent a proposal to the Electricity Regulatory Commission, in which the rate of electricity is Rs 6
 prati unit se adhik he, jabaki duusare thermal power plant grid main 3 ru
 Giving electricity at unit rate
 iske khilaaf ladaai ladi jaaegi
 "on the other hand, the farmers giving land to the power plant have a different pain
 chigaloa or mirchvaara gaanv kii kareeb 1,600 acre jameen power plant dwaara adhigrahit kiye jane ke baad vahaan ke kisaanon ko muaavja to mila, lekin company unke parivaar ke ek sadsy ko naukari dene ke apane vaade se mukar gai
 3 in lieu of one acre
 75 lakh ru
 Those who met were spent
 paise bhi gaye or jameen bhi
 Parshuram Yadav, a village man, considers it a sham in the name of development by the government
 ve kehete hai, ''chigaloa or mirchvaara ke 2,000 kisaanon ne apni 1,600 acre jameen power plant ke liye di he, lekin plant banane ke baad gaanv bejaar ho gaya
 Ten people of the village also did not get employment in the plant
 ve bihar or chennai se majdoor bulaakar kaam kara rahe hai or gaanv ke log roji kii talash main palaayan kar rahe hai
 "on the other hand, the electricity being produced in Bundelkhand is illuminating the VVIP district of the state
 jhaansi main sthit parichha thermal power plant rojaanaa 970 megawatt bijli kaa utpaadan karata he or sidhe uttar pradesh power korporation ko saunp detaa he
 Similarly, all power plants of Bundelkhand send electricity directly to the grid and only two to three hundred megawatts of power comes from Bundelkhand
 yah bijli itawa, lakhanu, raibareli or amethi ko raushan kar rahi he
 Bundelkhand requires a total of 600 MW of power, which can be completed by one unit of the b Jazz Power Plant alone 
 aise saikadon sawaal munh baae khadey hai or jawaab main netaa, adhikari sab chuppi saadhe baithe hai
 Akhilesh Yadav is coming to inaugurate the plant on 20 September, but the Yaksha question has retained its place
 bijli banegi to pahonchegi kaise? or pahonchegi bhi to kahaan? Aaj Tak has got a big information in the 2000 crore Thane Drug Hall case
 hamaare sahyogi india today ko chaanbin main pataa chalaa he ki antarrashtriya str par drug kii taskari karne waalon main se ek jaid ne bharat ke taskaron kishor rathore or jayamukhi ke saath meeting kii thi

 a murder incident in Dehradun also shocked the police
 ek software ejeeniyar ne apni bivi kii hatya ke baad laash ke chote-chote tukade kiye, unhen freezer main chipaaya or phir ek-ek tukdaa thikaane lagaataa rahaa
 Rajesh Gulati, who was living with a corpse in his flat since 17 October, is the name of the young man who committed this disgusting incident
 laash bhi kisi or kii nahin, balki uski patni anupama kii
 Rajesh had done love marriage with Anupama about 11 years ago
 isse bhi zyaada dahala dene vaali baat yah he ki apni bivi ko maarane ke baad rajesh ne laash ke 70 tukade karke frizer main rakh diya or laash ke ek-ek tukade ko rose thikaane laga
 When the police reached Rajesh's house, fragments of Anupama's corpse were found in the fridge
 padosi hairaan the, kyonki hatya karne ke baavjood rajesh usee flats main apane judwa bacchon ke saath aise rah rahaa tha, maano kuch hua hi nahin
 People were wondering why Rajesh killed his wife so brutally? Rajesh had no regrets killing Biwi
 lihaaja log yah sochane ko majaboor the ki aakhir miyaan-bivi ke bich aisa kya ho gaya, jisane america ritern software ejeeniyar ko itnaa beraham qaatil bana diya
 However, the forensic team reached the spot and started investigating the case

 Shahid wished to work with Deepika
 magar kam se kam film 'shandaar' main aisa nahin ho sakaa

 After that, the state Health Minister Mangal Pandey has taken the front on behalf of BJP
 mangal pandeya ne tejasvi yadav ko salaah di he ki wo abhi raajnneeti main bachche hai
 Speak as much as you have learned so far, choose the words with restraint or else the people of Bihar will give such a lesson to their party in the coming elections that they will be ashamed to show their face

 Lalu Yadav is going to become the Chief Political Advisor of Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 iskaa matlab ye nahin ki wo ahamed patel kii jagah lenge
 With this, talks are going on with your rebel leaders - and they are expected to join Congress soon
 ye sab hua kaise?sabase bada sawaal to yahi he? lalu yadav achaanak itane kareeb kaise ho gaye?darasal, lalu yadav hi wo pehle netaa thejinhone sonia gandhi ke videshi mul ke mudde par khul kar bachaav kiya
 In later days too, he was seen to go further than the Congress spokespersons and advocate sonia-rahul
 lalu kii inhen baton ne sonia or rahul ke man main lalu ke prati ek soft corner banaaya or baat yahaan tak pahunch gai
 Anyway, Rahul Gandhi is in favor of outsourcing expert advice
 saath hi, congress kii badi samasya ye bhi thi ki raashtrapati ban jane ke baad pranab mukherjee kii raay na ke baraabar mil paati he
 In such a situation, the Congress was looking for one such leader to fill that space
 is paimaane main lalu yadav ne khud ko feet kar liya - or baat ban gai
 What changes will be made in the Congress? If reliable sources are to be believed, the complete rejuvenation of the Congress is going to take place
 philhal congress ke andar or baahar jo kuch bhi ho rahaa he wo lalu kii salaah par rahul kii marji se ho rahaa he
 It is said that on the advice of Lalu, just before the budget session, Rahul decided to go to Bihar on long leave
 lalu ke hi kehane par sonia gandhi congress netaaon ke saath manmohan singh ke ghar tak - or phir vipakshi netaaon ke saath raashtrapati bhawan tak march karte hue pahunchin
 With this, many more changes are going to take place in the party - the Political Advisory Council, like the National Advisory Council functioned while in power, the political advisory council will have the same role in the changed situation
 khaas baat ye he ki isamen partline se parhez jaisi koi baat nahin hogi
 That means the leaders of other parties can also be its members, provided they are ready themselves and their parties do not mind
 isamen har sadsy ko profeshnal paritoshik die jane kii vyavastha hogi
 Yogendra Yadav is said to be Rahul Gandhi's first choice for the Chairman of the Political Advisory Council
 isko lekar lalu yadav or yogendra yadav ke bich kai mulaakaaten ho chuki hai
 It is being said that there is talk of squabbling with Kejriwal and lettering or forming a new party
 ye sabakuch ek khaas ranneeti ke tahat ho rahaa he, jis par home work kaaphi pehle ho chukaa he or iske peeche sirf or sirf lalu kaa dimag he
 Internal Lokpal: Now Congress will also have an Internal Lokpal to give a message to the people that what are the party's intentions on the issue of corruption? However, it will not be formed afresh, but the screening committee will now act as a monitoring body
 lalu ne iske liye bhi yogendra yadav ke jariye admiral ramdaas se sampark kiya he
 It is said that Ramdas is also ready but he has some conditions
 media management cameticongress ne, lalu kii salaah par, ek majboot media management cameti banane kaa faisla kiya he
 Therefore, the responsibility will be given to Priyanka Gandhi
 is kaam main ajay maakan apni team ke saath priyanka ko acist karenge
 In order to compete with the hi-tech Modi government, Congress leaders will also have Twitter accounts and participation on social media will be increased
 mumkin he
 
 
 Things like the impossible and the strange but the truth can also be seen as reality
 charchaa he ki giriraaj singh or kumaar vishwaas bhi apane apane dalon main ghutan mahasoos karne lage hai
 Lalu Yadav has explained to the Congress leadership that in politics there is no permanent friend or foe, it is just a matter of chance
 kehete hai lalu is baat ke liye raji kar liya he ki ye donon agar baqayada maafee maang lete hai to inhen congress main set kiya ja saktaa he
 It is said that even after Manish Sisodia refuses, Lalu is trying to break him from the Aam Aadmi Party
 manish ke schuli dost kumaar vishwaas ko congress main laane ke peeche bhi lalu kii khaas ranneeti bataai ja rahi he
 Who can replace whom? Rahul Gandhi is not going to become Congress president at the moment
 lalu kii salaah par ek bich kaa rasta nikaala gaya he
 Under this, the party constitution will be amended and all rights of decision will be given to the vice president so that the workers are not confused about the two power centers
 haalanki, adhyaksh ke paas kisi bhi vakt vito kaa adhikaar hoga
 In the new system, Lalu's advice will be preferred over Patel
 agar aapke baagiyon kii team salaahkaar parishad main aane ko taiyaar ho jaati he to tamaam senior netaa haashiye par ja sakate hai
 Leaders like AK Antony will not be able to play any special role when Yogendra Yadav arrives, while the role of leaders like Kapil Sibal, p Chidambaram, Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Manish Tiwari will automatically reduce with the arrival of Prashant Bhushan
 usee tarah admiral ramdaas ke hone par jairam ramesh ko bhi apni bhoomika phir se talashni hogi
 At present, the biggest helplessness of the Congress is that it is not getting the replacement of Digvijay Singh
 is maamle main lalu ne bhi haath khadey kar die hai
 Lalu says that he can also persuade Anna in favor of the Congress if needed, but he is not even thinking about Digvijay
 purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh kaa kahana he ki ‘main sabhi se shanti banaae rakhane kii apil karata hum
