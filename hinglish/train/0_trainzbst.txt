 In the gaol test, Rangana Herath took 7 wickets for 48 runs and became the hero of Sri Lanka's victory
 srilanka ne 63 ran se team india ko haraaya to isamen herath kii gendbaazi ke alaava dinesh chandimal kii ballebaazi kaa khaas yogadan rahaa
 Herath took the wickets of KL Rahul, Ishant Sharma, Rohit Sharma, Wriddhiman Saha, Harbhajan Singh, r Ashwin and Ajinkya Rahane on the fourth day of the match
 37 saal ke herath ko match kii pehali pari main koi wicket nahin mila tha, lekin duusari pari main 7 wicket lene ke baad ab 61 test main 2
 With an economy of 75, he has 270 wickets in his account
 agar sirf galle maidan kii baat karen, to herath ne is maidan par 13 test main 68 wicket liye hai
 On the match-winning performance in Gaul, Herath said that the team was all-out for 183 runs, but we were able to bounce back because of Chandimal's brilliant batting
 herath ne kaha, 'maine match main apana sau fisadi diya isliye main safal rahaa
 i spoke to the spin bowling coach and thought we could win
 ' tippaniyan Despite having a knee injury, Rangana kept on bowling and decided the team's victory
 haalanki herath kaa maananaa he ki jab wo desh ke liye khel rahe hai to unhen apana sau fisadi dena hoga
 Not only this, the left-arm spinner, who took 7 wickets in the match, said that even after being 37 years old, he is still competing with young bowlers
 herath ke liye galle test raahat lekar aayaa he
 If Sri Lanka lost against Pakistan in June, the biggest reason for this was Herath's flop
 teen test kii series main herath ne do test main sirf do wicket liye
 In the series, Pakistan batsmen gave Herath less chances to take wickets and were ruled out of the third Test
 herath ne match ke chauthe din keel rahul, eshanth sharma, rohit sharma, riddhimaan saaha, harbhajan singh, aar aswin or ajinkya rahane kaa wicket liya
 The 37-year-old Herath did not get any wickets in the first innings of the match, but now 2 in 61 Tests after taking 7 wickets in the second innings
 75 kii iconomi se unke khate main 270 wicket ho gaye hai
 If just talking about the Gaul ground, Herath has taken 68 wickets in 13 Tests on this ground
 herath ne galle main match vining pradarshan par kaha ki team 183 ran par ol-out ho gai, lekin chandimal kii shandaar ballebaazi kii vajah se ham vaapasi kar sake
 Herath said, 'I gave my hundred percent in the match so i was successful
 maine spin gendbaazi coach se baat ki or laga ham jeet sakate hai
 Comments ghutane main chot hone ke baavjood rangana datakar gendbaazi karte rahe or team kii jeet ko tay kar diya
 However, Herath believes that when he is playing for the country, he will have to pay his hundred percent
 itnaa hi nahin match main 7 wicket lene vaale baayen haath ke spinner ne kaha ki wo 37 saal ke hone ke baad bhi yuva gendbaazon se takkar le rahe hai
 The gaol test has brought relief for Herath
 june main pakistan ke kilaaf srilanka ko haar mili to isaki sabase badi vajah herath kaa flop hona rahaa
 In the three-test series, Herath took just two wickets in two Tests

 The Congress on Friday asked questions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi through a dispute related to Anar Patel, the daughter of Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel, and demanded the SIT probe under the supervision of the Supreme Court and the resignation of the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 piem modi se is mudde par khud ko ‘paak saaf sabit karne ke liye’ kehete hue party ne unase poocha ki anaar patel se kathith rup se kareebi kaarobaari sambandh rakhane vaali ek company ko gir sher abhayaarany ke paas sarkari jameen aavantit karte samay kya unhen tatkaaleen rajasav mantri anandiben patel ke ‘spasht hiton ke takaraav’ kii jaankaree thi
 Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma said at the AICC press conference, 'was this allocation based on the decision of the Cabinet and its approval was given by the then Chief Minister (modi) and was the conflict of interest, if any, exposed?' He said that this issue would definitely be raised in the budget session of Parliament as it is directly related to the Prime Minister, who claims that he does not tolerate corruption at all
 ’’ sharma ne kaha ki supreme court kii nigaraanee vaali esaiti dwaara nishpaksh jaanch se hi sach saamne aayega kyonki sibiai or idi jaisi agenciyon par bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He said, 'we demand that a SIT be set up under the supervision of the Supreme Court to investigate this entire matter in a time bound manner
 nishpaksh jaanch ke liye gujarat kii mukhyamantri ko istipha dena chahie
 Citing publicly available information, Sharma claimed that in the year 2010, the Gujarat government allotted 250 acres of land near Gir Tiger Sanctuary to 'worldwoods Resorts and Reality Private Limited' to build a resort
 is aavanton 15 rupee prati varg meter yaa 60 hajaar rupee prati acre kii dar par hua
 Sharma alleged that the total cost of the land was only Rs 1
5 crore while the estimated market price of this land is around Rs 50 lakh per acre or Rs 125 crore for 250 acres
 tippaniyan He alleged that the company then bought 172 acres of arable land nearby, taking its total owned land to 422 acres

 Asking PM Modi to 'prove himself clean' on the issue, the party asked him if he was allocated government land near Gir Sher Sanctuary to a company that allegedly had close business ties to Anar Patel
 Revenue Minister Anandiben Patel was aware of the 'apparent conflict of interest'

 Sharma said that only a fair investigation by the Supreme Court-monitored SIT will reveal the truth as agencies like CBI and ED cannot be trusted
 unhone kaha, ‘ham maang karte hai ki is puure maamle kii samaypaband tareeke se jaanch ke liye supreme court kii nigaraanee main ek esaiti banaai jaae

 com / c4368avrpu— BCCI Women (@bcciwomen)february 6, 2019england ke khilaaf teen maichon kii tii-20 siries ko chaar march se assam ke baraasapaara main khelaa jayega
 a BCCI official told PTI on the condition of confidentiality, "mithali understands that captain Harmanpreet Kaur is focusing on preparing the team for the T20 World Cup and she is almost unlikely to play in that tournament
 ’adhikari ne kaha, ‘mitali kii kad kii khilaadi ko shandaar vidaai milani chahie or aisa england ke khilaaf hone kii sambhaavna he
 There has also been an indication that Mithali will not be selected (in the final 11) in all the matches against New Zealand and a senior member of the team management has conveyed this to him
 yah samajha jaataa he ki mitali team prabandhan kaa ishaara samaj rahi hai or cricket board unhen chote praaroop se apni sharton par sanyas lene kaa mauka degaa
 The official said, "it is not yet decided whether she will play the entire series against England or will retire after the first match of the series, like Ashish Nehra, a former fast bowler of the men's team
 ’tii-20 main dhimi strike-rate or kamjor kshatrarakshan ke karan unki jagah pakki nahin he, jiske kaaran unhen england ke khilaaf mahila tii-20 vishwa cap ke semifinal main jagah nahin mili
 However, the decision to keep Mithali out of the team was also disputed and he accused Committee of Administrators (COA) member Diana Edulji of ruining his career along with then coach Ramesh Powar
 is vivaad ke baad powar kaa qaraar aage nahin badha or dablyuvi raman ko mahila team kaa coach banaaya gaya
 Mithali has now scored 2283 runs in 85 T20 Internationals, including 17 half-century innings

 a statement by Modi government minister Nitin Gadkari, already in the heat of the Maratha movement, has added fuel to the fire
 kendriya mantri nitin gadakari kaa kahana he ki aarakshan rojgaar kii guarantee nahin he kyonki naukariyaan kam ho rahi hai
 In Aurangabad, Maharashtra, when Nitin Gadkari was asked questions related to the current movement of Marathas for reservation and such demand by other communities, he replied that even if reservation is given, there is no benefit because there are no jobs
 bank main iti ke kaaran naukariyaan kam hui hai
 Government recruitment is on hold
 naukariyaan kahaan hai?nitin gadakari ne aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan kii taraf ishaara karte hue kaha ki ek ‘soch’ he jo chaahati he ki niti nirmaataa har samudaay ke garibon par vichaar karen
 He said that a thought says that the poor is poor, he has no caste, creed or language
 uskaa koi bhi dharm ho, muslim, hindu yaa maratha (jati), sabhi samudaayon main ek dhada he jiske paas pahanane ke liye kapade nahin he, khaane ke liye bhojan nahin he
 'it is noteworthy that the agitation by the Maratha communities continues to demand 16 percent reservation in Maharashtra
 pune, nasik, aurangabad main yah andolan hinsak bhi hua kai jagahon par aagjanee bhi hui
 There were also reports of suicide of youths allegedly from many places
 pichley dinon vibhinn raajnneetik dalon se saathmukhyamantri devendra fadanaviski baithak bhi hui
 In which reservation of Maratha community was considered within the purview of the law
 sarkaar ne kaha ki kanoonee prakiya kii jaanch ke baad maratha andolan ke vishay main elaan kiya jayega jisase anya samudaayon ko milane vaale aarakshan par koi prabhaav na pade
 Explain that the opposition has been accusing the Modi government and the BJP of trying to abolish reservation
 vahiin bijepi or swayan pradhanmantri is baat ko kah chuke hai ki aarakshan ko koi haath nahin laga saktaa
 The opposition is trying to create confusion
 apane bayaan ke baad main gadakari ne bhi yahi paksh rakhaa or twit kar kaha ki aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan kii sarkaar kii koi manshaa nahin he

 Energy Minister Satyendra Jain said that he had written a letter to Union Coal Minister Piyush Goyal on May 17 about the shortage of coal, but even after a week passed, there has been no response from the Central Government

 While canceling his anticipatory bail, the court said that the investigating officers have sufficient evidence against Teltumbde
 bataa den ki kuch samay pehle pune police ne teltumbade ke goa sthit awaas par bhi chhapemari kii thi, jisamen police ko kai mahatvapurn saboot bhi mili the
 The Pune police has already arrested some leftist thinkers like Varvara Rao, Arun Ferreira, Sudha Bhardwaj, Gautam Naulakha and Vernon Gonzalviz in this case

 Later, the British and Mahars together fought this battle against the Peshwa and defeated the Peshwa
 a post shared by Bigg Boss 12 (@biggboss_khabri) on Nov 20, 2018 at 9:18am PSTA post shared by Bigg Boss 12 (@biggboss_khabri) on Nov 20, 2018 at 11:08pm PST Yogi Adityanath, the new Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh and fifth time MP from Gorakhpur, made his last speech in Lok Sabha on 21 March
 bhagava vastra main asaamaanya rup se vinamr dikh rahe yogi ne uttar pradesh ko ''jati or dharm ke purvagrahon, dangon or asaamaajik gatividhiyon se mukti" ek adarsh rajya main roopantarit karne kaa vaada kiya
 He said, "I will call you all there to see the new Uttar Pradesh
" " aisa laga ki yah roopantaran aanshik taur se shuru ho chukaa he—aag ugalane vaali hindutvvaadi chhavi se adityanath vikaas ke maseehaa banane kii raah par mud chuke hai
 Some of his recent announcements, however, have been as shocking as the bjp's decision to make him the head of the country's largest state on March 18
 ashanka kii awaajon kaa uthanaa bhi lajimi tha
 He has a long history of anti-muslim speeches since Adityanath's entry into politics in 1998 as a disciple of the Mahant of Gorakhnath Math
 ek baar 2009 kii raily main unhone kaha tha, ''main jab bolta hum to hajaaron log sunate hai
 When i tell them to stand up and protect Hindu culture, they obey me
 agar main unase unka khun maanguun to ve apana khun bhi de denge
 
 
 Until i make UP and India a Hindu nation, i am not going to stop
 " pichley saal unhone jo paanch privet member bill sansad main pesh kiye the, unamem ek vidheyak samvidhan ke anuchhed 1 main bharat kaa naam badalakar hindustan karne ke liye tha
 He had targeted Shah Rukh Khan in November 2015 when he expressed concern over the climate of intolerance in the country
 yogi ne kaha tha ki is abhinayta or hafiz said kii bhashaa main koi fark nahin he
 He had said, "if a large number of people boycott his films, he too will have to wander the streets like ordinary Muslims
" "mukhyamantri ke liye modi-shah kii is pasand se cabinet ke aalaa mantri bhi hairaan rah gaye the
 Adityanath overtook all rivals
 inamen kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh, upi bhaajapa adhyaksh keshav prasad maury or rail rajyamantri manoj sinha the
 OBC face Maurya has also been made Deputy Chief Minister along with Dinesh Sharma of Brahmin caste
 vipaksh kaa kahana he ki adityanath ke satta ke centre main aa jane se yah rajya mandir-masjid or dhruvikaran vaale asthir dinon main laut jayega
 CPI (M) leader Brinda Karat said that UP is a "new ground for experimentation" for the RSS
 unhone poocha he, ''(upi ke chunaav main) aresas kii jeet hui he
 Therefore, he has chosen this Chief Minister
 is vyakti kaa aapraadhik record he
 Apart from spreading riots in all the courts of UP, they are facing trial in some more serious crimes
 phir aapradheekaran ko samaapt karne kaa yah jumala kyon diya ja rahaa he?" congress ke aalaa netaa salmaan khurshid ne twit kiya, ''paakhand band karo! yogi adityanath us kursi par baithenge jis par kabhi pantaji, endity (narayan dutt tiwari) or bahugunaji jaise log baithte the
 PM has also put the bjp's trolls in trouble! It should be understood
 "kai logon ke liye adityanath kaa 19 march kaa shapath grahan kisi suvichaarit yojana jaisaa he
 They believe that the BJP has returned to its hardline Hindutva agenda by promising development during campaigning
 sutara bataate hai ki yogi kii tajposhi tay nahin thi
 His selection has nothing to do with his Hindutva tendency but it is the bjp's promise of electoral arithmetic and corruption-free government
 party ke andruni logon kaa kahana he ki aisa nahin hota to naam kaa elaan karne main hafte bhar kaa vakt nahin lagata
 Despite a landslide victory in Uttar Pradesh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah's eyes will not leave a disturbing fact
 vah yah he ki samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party ko mili kul vot bhaajapa ko mili voton se chaar fisadi zyada the
 This means that if these two big parties of UP had joined hands, they could have stopped the bjp's Vijay Yatra
 modi or shah kaa maananaa he ki 2019 main samoochaa vipaksh unke khilaaf ekajute ho jayega
 It is quite possible that in 2019, a grand alliance like Bihar will be seen at the national level, which defeated the BJP in the 2015 assembly elections
 upi main bhaajapa ko loksabhaa chunaav main sabase zyada 71 siten mili thim
 That is why the biggest measure for the candidates who took cognizance of modi-shah was to win UP in the party bag in 2019
 maury, sinha ore rajnath singh ke naam chal rahe the
 All were ready for this task because all three were confident that the overwhelming majority would be able to stabilize the government
 inke naam haalanki alag-alag kaarnon se chhaant die gaye
 Rajnath Singh is 65 years old
 jaahir he, unki dhalati umr aade aa gai
 Keshav Maurya seems soft in battling hard with the complex political reality of the country's largest state
 55 varshiya sinha ko samajhadaar mana ja rahaa tha lekin unki dhilidhali chhavi aade aa gai
 BJP president Amit Shah was the main advocate of Adityanath
 pradhanmantri shuru main do kaarnon se yogi ke naam se parhez kar rahe the
 One, Yogi's poisonous speeches came in the way of Modi's image of a new pluralistic hero and second, Yogi had strongly opposed Modi before 2014 as he felt that Modi had become soft on the issue of Hindutva
 yah vah daur tha jab adityanath kii pahchaan bhaajapa se zyada vishwa hindu parishad se hoti thi
 The Prime Minister confirmed the name of Yogi only when Shah agreed to a compromise with Yogi that he would not only outlaw "vhp-style Hindutva" and poisonous speeches but also curb his saffron followers
 unka buniyadi kaam haalanki bhrashtachar or bhai-bhatijawad ko samaapt karnaa rahegaa
 Modi and Shah feel that if Yogi Adityanath can pull this state out of the trap of misrule, the political message emanating from the biggest province of the country will resonate across the country
 vishaal gorakhnath math main sthit apane saamaanya shayankaksh se yogi adityanath kaa din rojaanaa tadake 3 baje shuru hota he
 After the Pujapath they go towards the monastery premises and after that go to the Goshala and feed jaggery to the cows
 taaja chanaa, halava or falon kaa naashtaa karne ke baad saadhe nau se lekar 11 baje tak ve apane karyaalay main baithte hai or logon kii shikaayatein sunate hai
 They try to resolve everything from property disputes to family conflicts
 apni samasyaayein lekar musalmaan bhi unke paas aate hai
 Some of his close associates are Muslims and many of the patients in the 400-bed charitable hospital in the monastery are also Muslims
 gorakhpur or maharajaganj jile main kareeb chaar darjan shaikshanik, swasthya or anya sansthaanon kaa prabandhan unhen prashaskeey kaushal se yukt karata he
 Yogi alias Ajay Singh Bisht, born here of Forest Ranger Anand Singh Bisht, was educated up to tenth in the ancestral village Panchur, after which he moved to Kotdwar
 rishikesh ke ek college se unhone ganit main biessi kii oopaadhi lee
 His secretary and college classmate HS Rawat says that Adityanath's tendency has always been towards spirituality
 ve kehete hai, ''ve hanuman ke param bhakt hai or har mangalvaar upwas rakhte the
 "soon after the Babri Masjid demolition in December 1992, Adityanath was approached by Mahant Avaidyanath, a BJP MP from Gorakhpur and Mahant of Gorakhnath Math
 shuruyaat main unase milane ve dilli ke saansad awaas par aate rahe, phir gorakhpur sthit math main jane lage
 The Mahant recognized the spiritual instincts within him and became his disciple
 adityanath bhi sanatani hinduon ke nath sampradaay se aate hai, jo jati ke vibhaajanon ko nahin maanata
 One of the reasons that favored his election is because the sect has a pan-india presence and the BJP hopes that Adityanath will rise above caste divisions at the national level and appeal to the public, as in UP today
 modi or shah kaa anumaan he ki adityanath aanshik rup se bhi prashaasak ke bataur kaamyaab ho gaye to vipaksh samet bhaajapa ke bheetar bhi unke virodhiyon kii sankhya maamuli hogi
 The party expects them to show results on the law and order front and make the image of the Uttar Pradesh government such that it does justice, does not favor anyone
 kanoon-vyavastha ke morche par unase lagaai gai ummiido kaa ek aadhaar yah bhi he ki dabang adityanath ke ubhaar ke baad hi gorakhpur main harishankar tiwari or virendra shahi jaise gangstaron kaa jangal raaj khatm ho paaya tha
 Adityanath rose to Shah's notice when the BJP saw more than 250 seats in a BJP poll before demonetisation
 agar isse kam siten aatin to bhaajapa ke sheersh netaaon ne alag-alag kaarnon se khud hi unke naam kaa virodh kar diya hota, chaahe yogi ke ruukhe vyavhaar ke kaaran, muslim virdohi bhaashanon ke kaaran yaa phir is dar se ki kahin aane vaale varshon main yogi rashtriya str par ubharkar unki jagah na chin len
 Another reason could have been that Yogi is so strongly opposed to the culture of nepotism that leaders are unable to get them to work for their people
 notebandi ke baad jab party ke aantarik surveykshan main 306 siten saamne ain, us vakt adityanath mukhyamantri pad ke shashakt daavedaar ke rup main ubhar chuke the
 Shah believed that the Yogis were the most suitable person to fix the administrative rot of UP
 upi bhaajapa ke pravaktaa chandramohan kehete hai, ''bhai-bhatijawad ke khilaaf yogiji bahut sakht hai
 They believe in justice, not in doing favor
 modiji ke aane se jis tarah upi main laabh-lobh kii samskruti ko bada jhatka laga tha, thik vaise hi yogiji ke aane se bichauliye or dalal kaanp rahe hai
 "A source close to the BJP high command states that Adityanath has been chosen because of two things that UP needs most at the moment: his clean image and his tireless work on issues of concern
 gonda se bijepi ke saansad kirtivardhan singh kehete hai, ''unhen yah samajhnaa hoga ki kattar hindutv ke din lad gaye
 "they say that there is no question of calling the Chief Minister for transfer and reinstatement because there is a fear of" clean aura of Yogiji ", which cannot be corrupted
 adityanath kii modi kii aalochana sammaan main badal gai, jab 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bina ram kaa naam liye yaa hindutv se judaa koi bhaavnaatmak mudda uthaae modi ne upi main 71 siten jeet leen
 Yogi is satisfied that saffron jumlabji is no longer as effective in elections! Instead it is more beneficial to give voice to the aspirations of the people and limit the tool of Hindutva to opposition to Muslim appeasement by rival parties
 mukhyamantri banate hi yogi ne raftaar pakad lee
 In the first cabinet meeting, he advised his ministers to refrain from vengeance or the politics of heroism
 phir unhone aalaa naukarshahon ko party kaa ghoshnaptr thamaate hue unase kaha ki usamen die vaadon ko saakaar karne ke liye ve yojanaayen banaaen
 Says Bharat Pandya, a senior Gujarat BJP leader, "I have seen for the first time that a chief minister is giving the party's manifesto to bureaucrats on the first day and asking them to work on it
" " samaajawaadee party ke varisht netaa ramgopal yadav kaa kahana tha ki adityanath ke bare main koi faisla dene se pehle ve chah maheene tak unke kaam par najar rakhenge
 In his farewell address to the Lok Sabha, Adityanath reminded the House how he had freed Gorakhpur from gang warfare, riots and hooliganism
 in uplabdhiyon ko aaj ve samooche upi main jab dohraane kii raah par nikal pade hai, to unke dimag main yah khyaal jarur hoga ki agle kuch varshon ke dauraan sabase zyada nigaah agar kisi netaa par rakhi jaaegi to vah ve hi honge

 In a village program in Hathras, many slogans were raised for Varun Gandhi, who reached the farmers' program
 'hamaara siem kaisaa ho, varun gandhi jaisaa ho', jaise naare khub lage
 Varun Gandhi just smiled upon hearing such slogans
 varun gandhiyun to bijepi se kate kate najar aate hai, lekin haal ke dinon main upi main unki sakriyata ne raajnneetik panditon ko bhi hairat main daal diya he
 Now Varun Gandhi is attending a conclave somewhere, sometimes at a children's seminar and somewhere, distributing check checks among the families of the farmers who committed suicide

 On the riots too, Varunavarun said in a philosophical sense, referring to the post-muzaffarnagar riots and said that where blood flows, neither mother Lakshmi comes nor mother Saraswati nor there is progress
 yahi nahin varun ne satta parivartan se aage badhkar vyavastha parivartan kii baat kii

 Today, when it comes to football, the two players whose names first come to mind are Leonel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo
 in donon khiladiyon main ek samanta he ki donon hi apni tiimon ke liye "forward" khelte hai
 But it is a difficult question to tell who is better among these two and there can be no definite answer to it, because the style of playing both is different

 bataa den ki is match main mesi ne 11 prayaas kiye jisamen se 3 target par the, lekin unamem se ek bhi gol main nahin badal paaya
 Not only this, Messi also missed a penalty, which led his team to be content with the draw in the match
 vahiin is baar group bi ke apane pehle match main portugal kii team kaa muqabla spain se tha jo ki barabari par khatm hua
 But we can say that it was due to Ronaldo's hat-trick that Portugal's team got the draw, because Spain's team was playing very well
 lekin match ke aakhri minuton main ek behtareen gol dagkar ronaldo ne naa sirf apana hetric lagaaya balki team ko haar se bachane main bhi kaamyaab rahe

 The report explained that the front facing camera has a laser sensor and infrared sensor that can be used for facial gesture recognition, apart from face recognition, it is also reported that it will also have an iris scanner
 yani iphone 8 mendo ricognishan system honge
 However, such reports have been available even before the iphone 7
 lekin is baar in reports par isliye bhi vishwaas kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki aipal ne ek patent main home batan ke kuch nae function ke liye aavedan kiya he
 This render is also strengthening the report that this time the company will give vertical rear camera

 Despite Raju being speechless, he approached the Allahabad High Court
 lekin adaalat kii choukhat se bhi use rihaai kii jagah mili taarikh ke baad taarikh
 Raju, who is fighting for the justice of his release, is not a human, but a handsome elephant, who has been in government imprisonment for the last 6 months in the fight to prove his ownership

 Raju is currently in custody in a temporary prison created by the government
 jaise-jaise sardi apana sitam dha rahi he, raju kii museebataan bhi badhati ja rahi hai

 raju dwaara maare gaye mahavat ke bhai mewaalaal ke mutabik, mahavat kii galati bas itani thi ki hathi ko vah samay se khaanaa-pani nahin de rahaa tha
 No bread was being given to the elephant for three to four days
 usee se naaraaz hokar hathi ne usko dabaa diya or mahavat khatm ho gaya
 Forest Department official KS Yadav says that the elephant was caught without license on the night of July 29 and it killed its mahout

 He said that he is ready for any investigation by the Finance Ministry in this matter
 sadak parivahan mantri gadakarike bayaan se asantosh jataate hue congress ne sadan se walkout kar diya
 The Rajya Sabha remained in a deadlock over the last two days on this issue and till Tuesday before lunchtime
 vipaksh kaa aarope tha ki gadakari se sambandhit company purti saakhar kaarkaane ne sabsidi kaa durupyog kiya or lone nahin chukaaya
 Gadkari Gadkari, who is ready to probe the Finance Ministry, repeated the statement made in the House on Tuesday on the demand of the opposition and said that he has not been given any benefit
 unhone kaha, 'agar duniya kii kisi bhi adaalat main mere khilaaf bhrashtachar kaa aarope sabit hota he to vah na sirf mantri pad balki sansad kii sadsyta se bhi istipha dene ko taiyaar hai
 He challenged the Congress members that if they want to do this, they can get any inquiry done by the Finance Ministry

 There is no mention of any irregularity or corruption in this report even in respect of Purti Sakhar factory
 ’ unhone kaha ki purti saakhar kaarkaane se saal 2000 se 2011 ke bich bataur adhyaksh jude the
 He questioned, 'is taking loans a corruption? Is it corruption to repay the loan with interest? ”he said that the CAG report was sorted out in response to the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IRDA) response to 29 companies being given loans
 unhone kaha ki kaig kii report main lone ke kisi bhi prakaar se galat istemaal, herapheri yaa phir bhrashtachar kii baat nahin kahin gai he
 Purti did not make any irregularities: Gadkari Gadkari said that Irda had given this loan to his company and the process was completed as a one-time settlement process in 2008-09 under its valid standard
 us samay centre main upie kii sarkaar thi
 Gadkari said, 'at that time i was neither an MP nor was any of the posts of the Government of India
 ’ kendriya mantri ne kaha ki audit report main irada main jo prakriya apanaai gayi usamen kuch khamiyaan or aniyamitata kaa aarope he

 ’ After reviewing the cbi's affidavit on the draft status report of the investigation related to the coal allocation scam, the Supreme Court said in a terse tone that the original spirit of the status report on the coal scam was changed at the behest of the government
 sibiai kii haalat ko lekar supreme court ne chintapurna swar main tippanee kii ki jaanch agency (sibiai) pinjre main band tote ke samaan ho gai he, jiske kai maalik hai or vah apane maalikon kii hi bhashaa bolti he
 The Supreme Court also questioned the government whether it would enact a law to free the CBI from government gripes
 court ne kaha ki sibiai par kisi bhi tarah kaa dabaav na ho, yah sunishchit karnaa behad jaruri he
 Ideally, no part of him should be teased during his investigation
 court ne kaha ki sibiai ko samajhnaa hoga ki yah jaanch report thi, progress report nahin, jise sarkaar or uske adhikariyon ke saath saajha kiya jaae
 The court said strongly that the CBI should know how to stand up to the pressures of the government and its officials
 maamle kii jaanch ko lekar bhi court ne tippanee kii or kaha ki maamla darj kiye jane ke baad se lekar ab tak koi mahatvapurn pragati nahin hui he
 The court also pulled up the law and coal ministries, saying that they were called to give information and they had no means of viewing and reading the CBI report
 supreme court ne koyala mantralay or piemo ke sanyukt sachivon kii sibiai ke adhikariyon se mulaakaat karne or draft report main badlaav ke suzav dene ke maamle par unki khinchaai kii
 The court said that cbi's job is not to communicate with government officials, but to make inquiries to bring out the truth
 vahiin, atorni general jeei vaahnavati ne court main apni taraf se safai pesh karte hue kaha, main sirf kanoonmantri ke kehane par sibiai afasaron se mila tha or jahaan tak draft states report kaa sawaal he, maine na vah report maangi, na dekhi
 Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj has said in her response that the Additional Solicitor General accused the Attorney General, the Attorney General on the Law Minister, but the truth is that all three have made a mistake
 darasal, sibiai nideshak ranjit sinha ne halafanama dekar kaha tha ki kanoon mantri, piemo or koyala mantralay ke varisht adhikariyon ne stats report main badlaav karwaae the
 In a nine-page affidavit filed by the CBI, CBI Director Ranjit Sinha said that no evidence against any suspect was removed and no change was made in the main intent of the status report
 isamen yah bhi kaha gaya he ki kanoon mantri ne aavanton kii vaidhaniktaa ke sambandh main anusandhan ke abhipraay ke bare main ek vaakya ko bhi hataaya tha
 The affidavit further states that at the instance of the Ministry of Coal and the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), the draft 'preliminary findings of the agency about the absence of a methodology in the direction of allocation of certain importance / points' were removed from the draft
 sthiti report varsh 2006-09 ke dauraan kiye gaye aavanton se sambandhit praarambhik jaanch 2(pii2) par aadhaarit thi

 supreme court ne sarkaar se bhi sawaal kiya ki kya vah sibiai ko sarkari shikanje se mukt karne ke liye kanoon banaaegi
 The court said that it is very important to ensure that there is no pressure on the CBI
 kaayade se uski jaanch ke dauraan uske kisi bhi hisse ko chhedaa nahin janaa chahie
 The court said that the CBI has to understand that it was an investigation report, not a progress report, to be shared with the government and its officials
 court ne talkh lahaze main kaha ki sibiai ko pataa hona chahie ki sarkaar or uske adhikariyon ke dabaavon ke aage kaise khadaa hona he
 The court also commented on the investigation of the case and said that no significant progress has been made since the case was registered
 court ne kanoon or koyala mantralayon kii bhi khinchaai karte hue kaha ki unhen jaankaree dene ke liye bulaayaa gaya tha or unka sibiai report ko dekhne or padhane kaa koi matlab nahin tha

 Now imagine 2017 and now the same is happening in the case of GSTN tax return
 july ke tex ritern ke liye jab se jiestn kaa windo online hua he, akhabaaron main shikayaton kaa tantaa lag gaya he
 Some traders say that the tax has been paid but the GSTN receipts reveal something else
 kuch logon ko aisi raseeden mili hai jinamein dheron galtiyaan hai
 Many people could not pay their tax due to 'server delays' and 'session is over'
 ise lekar virodh itnaa zyada tha ki july kaa tex ritern bharne kii antim taarikh paanch din badhaakar 10 sitambar kar di gai
 But before that date came, GST on 8 September
 jiovi
 IN crashed
 ab antim taarikh ko ek baar phir badhaakar 10 aktubar kar diya gaya he
 Some people say that this happened due to too many people filing tax returns at the last minute
 agar yah sach he to badi vicitra baat haih july ke ant main da hindu ke sharad raghavan ne jiestn ke purv chayaraman naveen kumaar ko uddhrut karte hue likhaa tha, ''hamane karadaataaon ke swabhaav kaa adhyayan kiya

 Here is an example: On the day Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced the new deadline of October 10, he also announced several changes to the tax code: lower tax rates on many items like raincoats and rubber bands
 Taxes were levied, taxes were levied on several categories of cars, and Khadi was completely exempted
 har, sudhaar, ke baad programing kerani padati he or yah kaam infosis jaisi companiyon ko karnaa hota he
 These problems are also troubling because they were already seen

 After leaving the BJP, Sidhu, the former opener of Team India, was in the fight of political batting from the Aam Aadmi Party or the Congress
 aakhirkaar AAP ke captain kejariwal se baat nahin bani, to punjab congress ke captain kii team se siyaasi khel khilne ko raji ho gaye
 Already included his wife in the Congress
 us din misses siddhu ne media se kaha ki ham donon ek aatma or ek sharir hai, main congress main aa gai hum, to sharir aatma se kitne din dur rah saktaa he
 It was decided that Sidhu will also hit political sixes along with Punjab Congress Captain Amarinder
 19 janvari se karenge congress ke liye batting19 janvari ko siddhu, captain amarinder ke saath amritsar main darbar sahib main mattha tekkar punjab main congress ke liye ballebaazi shuru karenge
 Rahul's strategist PK, who played a key role in Sidhu's joining with the party, is trying to see unity between Amarinder and Sidhu
 kyonki ab tak donon ke bich qad ko lekar kheenchaatani kii khabaren aati rahi hai
 Joining Birbal's khichdi became a problem in Congress, but a long time passed, Sidhu's joining of Congress became a slang
 tamaam tarah ke sawaal siyaasi maidan main tairne lage, tabhi 11 janvari ko achaanak siddhu ne rahul gandhi se gupachup tareeke se unke ghar jaakar mulaakaat kii, tab ek baar phir pakkaa hua ki siddhu congress main hi aaenge, phir lohadi guzar gai, makar sankranti bhi chali gayi, to phir atakalon kaa bazaar garm ho chalaa, tabhi dhooma dhadaake or tahaakon ke liye mashhoor siddhu ne ravivaar subah akele chupchaap rahul se mulaakaat kii or baad main congress ne photo ke saath twit kar bataa diya ki siddhu ab congressi ho gaye hai
 Everything happened in great silence
 media main apni dialog delivery ke liye jane jane vaale siddhu ne media main ek shabd nahin bolaa
 Yes, there was a tweet, in which after talking about Punjab and Punjabiyat, he said that in future, Sidhuvani is going to rain Kejriwal as an outsider
 kyon hui jwining main deree?darasal, sutron kii maane to siddhu pehle to tivi kii duniya ke apane kamitment puure karnaa chaahate the, isliye deree hui
 After that, when the party asked him to join the party on 9 or 10 January, Sidhu cited Tara as being submerged
 aakhir siddhu congress main sitara banane kaa rahe the, to bhala sitaron kii chaal ke hisaab se hi chalanaa chah rahe the
 But the opposite news did not come to the media, so Rahul was met
 jwining se pehle rakhi thi shartsiddhu ab ek nai shart rakh chuke the, wo captain amarinder or aashaa kumari ke bajaay rahul gandhi ke saamne congress jwine karnaa chaahate the, aakhir sawaal siyaasi qad kaa jo tha, wo khud ko capten amarinder se chota jo nahin dikhaanaa chaahate
 But the difficulty of the Congress was that Rahul or Sonia do not come to the party office to join any leader, yes - before joining, they are definitely met with Rahul or Sonia

 Today or tomorrow
 jain tivi main bataur intern rahi raakhi birla ne patrakarita chhodkar aam aadmi party kaa daaman thama or congress ke kaddavar netaa ko dhul chataayee
 The list of journalists in the list of those joining the party is increasing day by day
 is list main guuruuvaar ko ek or patrkaar kaa naam jud gaya
 Senior Editor and well-known face of TV world Ashutosh has also joined the Aam Aadmi Party
 unhone ghoshnaa kii ki ab ve patrakarita kaa pesha chhodkar raajnneeti ke maidan main utarane ja rahe hai
 Ashutosh's name has also been included in the list of professionals joining the AAP party
 iske pehle air dekan ke sansthaapak captain gopinath, banker va royal bank of scotland (arabs) kii purv adhyaksh mira sanyaal or mashhoor nrutyaangna mallika sarabhai bhi party main shaamil ho chuki hai
 Many of those who joined the party belong to middle-class families, who have been raising voices against corrupt politicians and rotting systems from time to time
 congress or bijepi jaisi partiyaan hameshaa se hi swatantra khyalaat vaale nagarikon ke raajnneeti main jane vaale raste main rode atakati rahi hai
 Whereas in the Congress, it is good for those who salute at 10 Janpath and those who worship in Nagpur in BJP
 chunaav ladane kaa theka zyaadaatar partiyon ke diggaj netaaon ke rishtedaaron ko hi miltaa he yaa sattashinon ke karibiyon ko
 The inexperienced Aam Aadmi Party, which is dreaming of doing well in the Lok Sabha elections, wants to join people who can convey the right message of the party across the nation
 party kii puure desh main chaa jane kii aakanksha, un logon ko par de rahi he jo kahin na kahin maujuuda kharaab raajnneetik system ke tale dabe pade the
 After Manish Sisodia, Shazia Ilmi and Rakhi Birla, Ashutosh has joined the list, which will have the special responsibility of brightening and growing the party
 inamen se manish sitaudiya is samay dilli sarkaar main varisht mantri hai or arvind kejariwal ke behad kareebi hai
 Arvind joined Kejriwal's NGO Parivartan by quitting his job as a producer at Sisodia Ji News
 bhrashtachar virdohi andolan se judane se pehle shajia ilmi star news kii pramukh ankar thim
 The most emphatic was 26-year-old Rakhi Birla, who strongly knocked out PWD minister Rajkumar Chauhan in the election battle
 or ab ban gai hai dilli sarkaar kii mahila bal vikaas mantri
 As a reporter, Rakhi used to watch anti-corruption beat, who quit her job and jumped into Kejriwal's movement
 ashutosh ke liye to yah stoffhome syndrome tha
 They reported the Anti Corruption Movement in a very lively manner
 duusare sampadakon kii tarah inhone studio se hi nahin is par focus kiya balki ramlila maidan or jantar mantar main jaakar inhone kadi dhoop main pasinaa bahaate hue reporting kii
 He served the basic fundamentals of the party to the people in a very good manner and himself looked like an activist journalist
 ashutosh ne anna hajaare ke andolan par 'anna: 13days awecond india' kitaab bhi likhi he
 Ashutosh was associated with Aaj Tak for almost 11 years before joining IBN7
 tivi today main samvaadadaata ke pad se shuru hua safar agxcutive editor tak chalaa
 Ashutosh shone when BSP leader Kanshi Ram slapped him in the year 1996
 jab kanshiram apane ghar ke baahar jami patrakaron kii fouj ko jane ke liye kah rahe the, tab ashutosh unki bite lene ke liye unase ade hue the
 Ashutosh made the news of joining the Aam Aadmi Party in the morning via Twitter
 ashutosh ne twit kiya ki '8 saal pehle maine apana rasta badla tha or ab phir se vahi samay aa gaya he
 Destiny has another call
 mujhe iske saath badhanaa hi hoga
 These are historical moments
 saamaajik manthan chal rahaa he
 Everyone has to contribute to make this change stronger and more beautiful
 ' ashutosh IBN7 se abhi relive nahin hue hai, wo iskaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 They will join the party soon after relieving
 philhal CNN IBN ke managing editor vinay tiwari ashutosh kaa kaamkaaj dekhenge
 Ashutosh is seriously thinking about contesting the Lok Sabha elections from a party ticket
 baharhaal abhi tak yah spasht nahin hua he ki wo kahaan or kiske khilaaf chunavi jang main utrenge
 Kejriwal wants Ashutosh to be in the party's big decision-making team, with Yogendra Yadav as the lead
 party ke ashutosh firebrands pravaktaa rahenge
 Journalists coming into politics is not a new phenomenon
 emje akbar se lekar chandan mitra tak raajnneeti main aa chuke hai
 Coming back from politics to full time journalism is disastrous
 yah ek aisi lakshmana rekha he, jise sirf ekbargi hi paar kiya ja saktaa he
 Ashutosh's decision to the audience is quite shocking
 unka yah faisla darshakon ke man main yah baat daal rahaa he ki unka favorit ankar kahi biked to nahin tha
 However, it was good that Ashutosh started his political career and made it clear that he was not doing journalism as someone's face
 patrakarita ke mulya vahi sthapit kar saktaa he jo bina dare, bina paksh liye sabhi partiyon se ekasmaan prashn poochta he
 The popularity of the Aam Aadmi Party is increasing very fast at this time
 aane vaale kuch hafton main is party ko yadi or bhi hai profile log join kar len to zyada hairaani nahin hogi
 The word of change has been written
 dilli main to aagaaj ho chukaa he, samooche desh main hona abhi baaki he
 Uddhav said - if the question of Chief Minister is important, then Amit Shah can also come
 The results of Maharashtra elections have come in favor of National Democratic Alliance (NDA)
 bhartiya janata party aurshivsenagathabandhan ne aaraam se purna bahumat ke aankade ko chhu liya he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has won 105 seats
 uski gathbandhan sahyogi shivasena ne 56 siten jiti hai
 The bjp-shiv Sena pair may have won in Maharashtra but the results did not last as they expected
 endie sarkaar kii tasviir saaf hone ke baad guuruuvaar kii shaam shivasena supremoudhav thakrene press conference kii
 Even during this press conference, the Shiv Sena president showed the same old tantrums that he had been showing before the election
 shivasena adhyaksh ke man main kya he, is par bhi unhone khulkar bolaa
 Uddhav made it clear that he is adamant on his 50-50 formula
 mukhyamantri ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki maharashtra kaa aglaa mukhyamantri koun hoga? ye bada sawaal he
 This issue is important
 shivasena adhyaksh ne yah bhi kaha ki jarurat padi to bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah bhi yahaan aa sakate hai
 One thing became clear from the Shiv Sena president's press conference that he is not in the mood to be soft
 shivasena ne hameshaa hi pradesh kii siyasat main bade bhai kii bhoomika kii maang kii he
 In the last election, the two parties fought separate elections after the seats did not converge in this pull
 haalanki baad membhaspa122 siton ke saath sabase bade dal ke rup main ubhari, tab chunaav parinaam kii ghoshnaa ke baad shivasena sarkaar main shaamil hui thi
 Uddhav's pressure politics under changed circumstances, this time the situation is different
 bijepi 122 siton se girakar 105 seat par simat gai he
 The Shiv Sena is far away from the 63 seats it won last time
 aise main uddhav ko lag rahaa he ki bhaajapa par dabaav banane kaa yahi sahi samay he
 Let us know that even before the election, the BJP has been offering the post of Chief Minister to the Shiv Sena, but the Army is eyeing the post of Chief Minister
 uddhav ke tevar se ek baat to spasht he ki shivasena bhaajapa ko kam se kam pichhali baar kii tarah aaraam se sarkaar nahin chalaane degi
 Anna Hazare, who waged a nationwide movement against corruption in 2011, will now protest against the Modi government at the Center
 is baar bhi mudda janalokapal kii niyukti hoga
 After 15 days, a meeting of Team Anna's core committee will be held in Delhi, in which the direction of the movement will be decided
 dilli vidhansabha chunaav se pehle anna kaa yah elaan bijepi kii chintaaen badha saktaa he
 In Ralegan Siddhi, Maharashtra, Anna said, 'modi did not keep his promise on corruption
 nai sarkaar ko jitna samay dena chahie tha, utana de diya he
 Prime Minister Modi did not fulfill the assurance given before the election
 main sarkaar ke khilaaf pradarshan karuunga
 'significantly, Anna is unhappy with the central government on the issue of black money
 teen swiss bank khataadharakon ke naam saamne aane ke baad bhianna ne modi ko chitthee likhakarpradarshan kii chetavanee di thi
 Anna wrote in that letter that he would wait till the cold session of Parliament
 agar uske baad bhi agar kaala dhan waapas laane kii disha main thos kadam nahin uthaae gaye to vah modi ke khilaaf janata ko saath lekar sadakon par utrenge
 Anna wrote to Prime Minister Modi, 'you promised to bring back black money
 ab 100 din se zyada kaa samay ho chukaa he or aapane sirf teen naam bataae hai or koi karrwai nahin kii
 'anna, who once agitated against the UPA on the issue of corruption, wrote to Modi,' You also said that after the return of black money, every citizen will get Rs 15 lakh
 main sansad kaa sheet satr samaapt hone tak intjaar karuunga
 After that i will demonstrate against Modi with a large crowd
 'gauratlab he ki 2011 main janalokapal ke mudde par anna hajaare ne arvind kejariwal or anya sahyogiyon ke saath upie sarkaar ke khilaaf anshan kiya tha
 However, he parted ways with Kejriwal on the issue of forming a political party
 nepal ke andolankaaree madheshiyon ne vartmaan raajnneetik sankat ko hal karne or bharat ke saath lage ahm seemaa vyapaarik margon kii nakebandi khatm karne ke uddeshy se sansad main paarit hue samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak ko ‘apurna’ qaraar dekar khaarij kar diya he or kaha ki isse sangheey punarsimakan ko lekar unki chintaaon kaa samaadhaan nahin hua he
 Stating the amendment 'incomplete' The amendment, passed by a two-thirds majority on Saturday, focused on two important demands of Madheshis - proportionate representation to minority communities of Indian origin and allocation of seats in Parliament on the basis of population
 andolankaaree dalon ke saansadon ne yah kehete hue mat-vibhaajan kaa bahishkaar kiya ki yah sanshodhan apurna he kyonki yah sangheey punarsimakan samet unki chintaaon kaa samaadhaan nahin karata
 Despite being progressive, Rajendra Shrestha, co-chairman of the Federal Socialist Forum Nepal, the constituent of the imperfect Democratic Madhesi Morcha, said that the original bill introduced in Parliament on December 15, the proposal of the Nepalese Congress's Minendra Rizal and Fermullah Mansoor is much more progressive
 
 vibhinn dalon ke 100 se adhik saansadon ne vidheyak main sanshodhan kii maang karte hue 24 prastaav die
 The bill was passed by the House incorporating the motion filed by Rizal and Mansoor
 kathmandu post kii khabar he ki madhes aadhaarit andolankaaree dalon ne kaha ki sanshodhan prastaav, jiske aadhaar par samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak manjuur kiya gaya, pragatisheel hone ke baavjood apurna he
 Till the consensus was reached, protest leaders said they would make further comments after reading the original text in-depth
 shreshth ne kaha, 'lekin abhi koi tippanee karnaa bahut jaldbaaji hogi kyonki ham abtak sanshodhan prastaav puri tarah pard nahin paae hai
 'he said that the performance of the front would continue until the federal reimagination was agreed
 tarai kshetra ke bascindia madheshi nae samvidhan ke viruddh hai jo unke paitruk homeland ko saat prantiy dhaanche main baantta he
 Many people have been blocked by border trade routes with India

 Politicians and Media are constantly talking loudly about my being a defaulter who has run away with PSU Bank money
 All this is false
 Why don't i get fair treatment and the same loud noise about my comprehensive settlement offer before the Karnataka High Court
 Sad
 - Vijay Mallya (@thevijaymallya) December 5, 2018 On extradition, Mallya said that his case is completely different
 maalya ne media ko hi doshi tehraate hue kaha ki uske pratyrpan ko lekar media ek raay bana leti he
 Mallya said that my case is different and it will complete its legal proceedings
 jahaan tak bainkon ke paison kii baat he to maine ise puraa 100 pratishat lautaane kii peshkash kii he
 i humbly ask the bank and the government to take the money
 agar meri peshkash ko asweekaar kar diya gaya to kyon?airlines struggling financially partly becoz of high ATF prices
 Kingfisher was a fab airline that faced the highest ever crude prices of $ 140 / barrel
 Losses mounted and that’s where Banks money went
 i have offered to repay 100% of the Principal amount to them
 Please take it
 - Vijay Mallya (@thevijaymallya) December 5, 2018 Vijay Mallya said that leaders and media are constantly telling me that i am a defaulter and saying that i have run away with money from banks
 ye sab galat he
 Mallya said that why the proposal for settlement in my Karnataka High Court is not talked about
 maalya ne kaha ki sabhi mere saath anuchit vyavhaar kar rahe hai
 For three decades running India's largest alcoholic beverage group, we contributed thousands of crores to the state exchequers
 Kingfisher Airlines also contributed handsomely to the States
 Sad loss of the finest airline but still i offer to pay banks so no loss
 Please take it
 - Vijay Mallya (@thevijaymallya) December 5, 2018 Mallya said that Kingfisher did liquor business in India for thirty years
 is dauraan kai rajyon kii madad bhi kii
 Kingfisher Airlines was also paying richly to the government
 lekin is shandaar airlines kaa dukhad ant hua
 Nevertheless i want to pay the banks so that they do not incur any loss
 maalya ne kaha ki plis meraa ye ofer sweekaar karen
 i see the quick media narrative about my extradition decision
 That is separate and will take its own legal course
 The most important point is public money and i am offering to pay 100% back
 i humbly request the Banks and Government to take it
 If payback refused, WHY? - Vijay Mallya (@thevijaymallya) December 5, 2018 Vijay Mallya attributed the ruin of Kingfisher to the increase in fuel of the aircraft
 maalya ne kaha ki kingfisher ek shandaar airlines thi, jisane crude oil kii 140 dollar prati bairal ke ucchtam keemat kaa saamana kiya
 Losses kept increasing, money from banks kept going in this
 maalya ne kaha ki maine bainkon ko 100 pratishat mooldhan vaapasi kaa ofer diya he

 rajasthan ne paanch saal main satta badalane kii apni parampara is baar bhi kaayam rakhi
 Out of the election for 199 seats, voters gave the Bharatiya Janata Party only 73 seats and the Congress 99 seats, and the electors made farewell for the Vasundhara Raje-led BJP government and prepared the way for the Congress government
 dilachasp yah he ki congress or bhaajapa ko mili mat pratishat main antar zyada nahin rahaa
 39 to Congress
 3 pratishat vot mili jo ki bhaajapa ko mili vot se maatr 0
 5 percent more
 beshak congress ko mili vot bhaajapa kii tulana main zyada nahin rahe lekin congress ko 2013 kii tulana main zyada vot praapt hue hai
 In contrast to his 67-year-old arch rival Ashok Gehlot, whose Congress had reached its lowest tier of 21 seats in the 2013 mooted elections as chief minister, 65-year-old Raje almost retained his performance in the 2008 election
 tab bhaajapa ne 78 siten jiti thim
 The difference this time was that Raje had Sachin Pilot as the main rival before Raje
 utsahit payalat kehete hai, "pichley chunaav ke mukaable is baar hamaari siten paanch guna badi hai
 Although this gain could have been more, we are still satisfied with our performance
 '' mukhyamantri pad kii daud main payalat aage rahe hai
 However, Gehlot's experience may weigh on him
 2014 main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke haathon pradesh congress adhyaksh niyukt kiye gaye payalat ko tikat vitaran ke dauraan gahalot ke saath vipaksh ke netaa rameshwar dudi kii pasand kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana padaa tha (jabaki dudi khud chunaav haar gaye)
 As a result, the party could field fewer youngsters
 isse congress jahaan spasht bahumat hasil kar sakati thi vahaan use sirf badi jeet se santosh karnaa padaa
 The party fielded 40 candidates under 40, of which 26 won
 payalat kaa daawa he ki party par janata ne vishwaas kiya kyonki usne yuva chehron ko mauka diya
 Pilot started his innings as state president by moving forward as a leader ready to face challenges
 haalanki ve samajhate the ki narendra modi kii lahar unke liye loksabhaa ke raste mushkil kar degi phir bhi unhone ajmer se loksabhaa kaa upachunaav ladgaye kaa faisla kiya or mahangaai tathaa balaatkaar kii ghatnaon ke virodh main reliyaan or pradarshan kiye
 His style is in sharp contrast to Gehlot, who, despite claiming to be a Gandhian himself, rarely participates in any grassroots movement
 payalat party ke andar bante hue kaaryakartaaon ko ekajute karne main safal rahe or unki aguai main congress ne is saal loksabhaa kii do or vidhansabha kii ek seat jeet lee
 Rahul also slowly paved the way for the pilot in Rajasthan and removed Gehlot from state politics and made him organization secretary in Delhi
 haalanki unhone payalat ko mukhyamantri ke rup main pesh nahin kiya kyonki unhen gahalot kheme kii taraf se virodh kaa andeshaa tha
 Every caste and community of Rajasthan has contributed to this important success of the pilot
 masalan, meenaon ke dabadabe vaale bharatpur kshetra main gurjar samudaay ke payalat 14 siten jeetne main safal rahe jabaki bhaajapa ko sirf ek seat mili
 This situation happened when Kirori Lal Meena, who had rebelled and left the party at the will of Modi, Shah and RSS, was also brought back to BJP
 nattejey yah bhi dikhaate hai ki rajya or centre sarkaron kii kamiyon or kadacharon ko ujagar karne ke liye rajyabar main payalat kii yatra kii ranneeti behad kaamyaab rahi or ve janata ko congress ke saath jodgaye main safal rahe
 During these visits, he also shouted loudly the lack of basic facilities in urban areas
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki jaipur divijan main congress ne 29 siten jeet leen jabaki bhaajapa ko keval 10 siten milin
 Pilot says, "my focus was not just on the assembly elections but also on preparing the ground for the 2019 general elections
 '' asal main, is jeet ne party kaaryakartaaon ko itnaa prerit kiya he ki ve rajya main har paanch saal par satta parivartan kii parampara ko badalte hue 2023 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi phir se sarkaar banane kii bhi ummid laga rahe hai
 Pratap Singh Khachariwas, who won from Jaipur Civil Lines after defeating cabinet minister Arun Chaturvedi, says, "we will win the general election as well as the 2023 election
 ''raaje sarkaar ke 16 mantriyon, vidhansabha upaadhyaksh, mantriyon ke do beton, chah sansadeey sachivon or chaar baagi mantriyon kii haar bataati he ki sarkaar kis had tak alokapriy ho gai thi
 Obviously, Raje, who was busy bringing the government to digital mode, could not control her officers
 laabhon ke pratyaksh hastantaran ke baavjood, panchayat str par bhrashtachar bahut adhik tha or panchayat raaj ko digitise karne ke unke prayaason kaa mantri tak virodh kar rahe the
 Inefficiency and corruption were dominated at every level of administration, but neither Raje nor BJP removed incompetent ministers despite losing the February by-election
 bhaajapa ke maujuuda vidhayakon ne matadaataaon ke bich satta virdohi lahar ko or hawa di
 Out of the 163 winning last time, 60 mlas were elected for the first time and most of them won by riding on the Modi wave but after winning the elections, their focus was on making money from transfer postings
 chunaav purv bhaajapa ke apane aantarik surveykshan main bhi vidhayakon ke punah jeetne kii sambhaavnaaen bahut kam dikhi thim isliye party kareeb 100 vidhayakon kaa tikat kaatna chaahati thi lekin antat sirf 54 kaa hi tikat kaata gaya
 Raje's ministers were also considered to be too arrogant, even less in the constituencies
 raaje kaa modi or shah, donon ke saath matbhed rahaa he or jab chunaav prachaar ke dauraan teenon netaa ek saath saamne aae to bhi zyaadaatar logon ne ise gambhirtha se nahin liya
 In his last rallies, Modi did not even mention Raje once
 isse bhi badtar sthiti to tab hui jab shah or raaje kii aapasi khinchataan ke kaaran ashok paranami ke pradesh adhyaksh pad se hatane ke baad bhi party ne nayaa adhyaksh chunane main teen mahatvapurn maheene barbaad kar die
 Parnami, who contested from the Adarsh nagar seat in Jaipur, was defeated by Rafiq Khan of Congress by over 13,000 votes
 paranami kii jagah nae pradesh adhyaksh 75 varshiya madanlaal saini bhi bhaajapa kii naiya paar lagane main naakaam rahe
 The BJP also ignored its vote bank of angry small and medium traders due to demonetisation and GST
 isi prakaar supreme court ne essi / asti adhinium ke tahat sandigdhon kii tatkaal giraftaar nahin karne kaa faisla diya lekin centre sarkaar ne use nirast karne kii jo koshishen kin usase bhi obisi or agadi jatiyaan naaraaz ho gayi
 The Rajputs were in a tizzy over the killing of two gangsters belonging to their caste in a police encounter and started distancing themselves from the BJP
 haalanki raaje ne rajput netaaon se baat karne kii koshish kii hoti to unhen manaaya ja saktaa tha
 The BJP hoped that the atmosphere could be changed in its favor by raising the issue of Hindutva and targeting Muslims, but this could not happen
 desh ke pehle go-mantri otaraam devasi sirohi main ek nirdaleey or congress ke baagi ummidavaar sanyam lodha se 10,000 voton se haar gaye
 The party's performance was very poor in areas where mob violence against cows had resulted
 iske alaava tonk jahaan muslim aabaadi acchhee-khaasi he, vahaan se payalat ke khilaaf chunaav lade bhaajapa ke apane ekmaatr muslim pratyaashee or raaje sarkaar main mantri younus khan ko tikat dene se pehle jitani hila-hawali hui thi usne bhi muslim samudaay ko naaraaz kar diya tha
 Despite her travels across the state, Raje failed to dispel the notion that she did not like meeting people
 is baar unhen bahut alokapriy mana gaya tha
 Apart from this, government employees were also left at the mercy of their ministers to solve their problems
 un par ret or khanan mafiaon ko sangrakshan dene ke aarope lage
 Another reason behind this defeat is that the voters were treating the party as retractable and unfaithful
 apane kaarykaal ke zyaadaatar samay main raaje pradesh kii khastahal aarthik sthiti kaa ronaa roti raheen lekin chunaavon se ain pehle kisaanon ke 50,000 rupye tak kii karj maafee or kisaanon ke bijli kharch ke liye salanaa 10,000 rupye kii pratipurti kii lok-lubhaavan ghoshnaa bhi unhen isliye phayda na pahunchaa saki kyonki ve sanshodhit nunatam samarthan mulya ko lagu karne main puri tarah vifal rahi hai
 The BJP had ignored the fact that the populist promises made at the last minute could not get votes in the state
 2013 main gahalot ne bhi aisi koshish kii thi, lekin koi laabh na hua
 Nevertheless, Raje seems to be able to garner votes in some areas due to his welfare schemes
 maujuuda chunaav nateezon par bhaajapa ke saath congress ko bhi manthan kii jarurat he
 Independents and others won 26 seats while the state had a total of 3
 54 karod matadaataaon main se 4,67,000 matadaataaon yani 1
 3 percent pressed the NOTA (none of them) button, which shows that there is confusion among the people of Rajasthan about both parties
 raaje nai sarkaar ke liye ek khaali khajaana chhodkar gai hai or congress ke liye karj maafee or rojgaar ke nae avasar paidaa karne kaa apana vaada nibhaana bada mushkil hoga
 Vice Chancellor of Jaipur National University Sandeep Bakshi says, “congress needs a change in leadership to meet the growing aspirations of voters
 '' haalanki, payalat kaa kahana he ki congress ne keval vahi vaade kiye hai jo nibhaae ja sakate hai
 They say, "don't worry, we will touch new heights
 '' rajya ke logon ne nai sarkaar se kuch aisi hi aas laga rakhi he
 It is to be seen whether the new government fulfills his hope or disappoints him
 bhaajapa kyon haari-jo party ek karod matadaataaon tak pahunchane or prabhaavshaalee booth management kaa daawa karti he vah apane pradesh adhyaksh kii niyukti ko lekar teen maheene tak aapasi khinchataan main fansi rahi
 The new president Madanlal Saini did not have the support of Raje
 -raaje ne asantushton ko manaane ke liye kabhi khud baat nahin kii
 - They could not curb the inferior officials
 -ve or bhartiya janata party aksham or bhrasht mantriyon ko na to hataa pain, na hi unka tikat kaata

 Amid the ongoing clash in Parliament, Congress President Sonia Gandhi has questioned the Naga agreement
 unhone patrakaron se baat karte hue kaha ki sarkaar ne is samjhaute ko lekar uttar-purv ke kai mukhyamantriyon se baat nahin kii
 This agreement shows the pride of the government
 sansad main jari gatirodh kaa guuruuvaar ko bhi ant hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 Even after the government indicated that the suspension of the 25 mps of the Congress, the Congress is not ready to bow down
 vahiin ab is mudde par puraa vipaksh ekajute hota hua dikh rahaa he
 Angered by the suspension of Congress mps, Rahul Gandhi said, 'our voice is being suppressed in Parliament
 ' unhone naga samjhaute ko lekar pradhanmantri par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki teen rajyon manipur, assam or arunachal pradesh kii aawaaj ko bhi dabaaya ja rahaa he

 The CBI said that the investigation in this case is still going on

 The Supreme Court said that along with expanding the scope of CBI investigation in the 2G spectrum case, it should also include those incidents of 2001 when the NDA government introduced the controversial 'first come first served policy' for the allocation of spectrum

 It is now the job of the CBI to investigate and find out what happened

 In 2001, the government did not follow the auction policy and allocation of spectrum was done on first come first serve basis
 peeth ne aisi doorsanchaar niti kii vyavhaarikta par prashn khadey kiye jisamen spectrum kaa aavanton varsh 2007-2008 main varsh 2001 kii dar par kiya gaya
 The bench said that this policy is absurd

 The court said, 'in this commercial world all companies take care of their business interests
 aap hamen petrol varsh 2001 kii keemat par kyon nahin dete
 If you even call it a policy, then it is an absurd policy

 The bench said, "the way TR Adhyarjuna (A Raja's lawyer) has pointed out that it is more than what is visible with eyes
 ’ peeth ne yah bhi kaha ki yahaan tak ki kaig ne bhi dual takanic ke mudde kii ore dhyaan nahin diya
 According to the bench, 'the issue was not investigated
 ’ peeth ne kaha, ‘aap is mudde kii 2001 se jaanch kyon nahin karte
 The bench also emphasized that the spectrum allocation fee was fixed at the same time on a first-come-first-served basis

 is par peeth ne kaha, ‘aap jaanch ko gopneey rakhana chaahate hai lekin sabhi televijan channel aapke dwaara maare gaye chaape ko channel par dikhaa rahe hai
 Advocate Prashant Bhushan, on behalf of the Center for Public Interest Litigation, an NGO seeking monitoring by the Supreme Court, said, "these raids by the CBI have no meaning
" ’unhone kaha ki janata party adhyaksh subramanyam swami evam anya kii shikaayat ke baavjood agency ek varsh tak haath par haath rakhkar baithi rahi
 The CBI filed an FIR against unknown people on October 21, 2009, almost a year later, instead of taking action on the complaint
 jin tathyon ke liye sibiai ne chaape maare hai vah uske bare main use praathmiki darj kiye jane ke samay hi jaankaree thi
 Venugopal said that the investigation into the scam would be completed by February next year but it would be limited to the country as more time would be required for investigation outside the country

 khandpeeth ne sibiai ke is suzav ko nakaar diya ki adaalat is maamle se jude aadesh silband lipaphe main de de
 The bench said, "orders given in sealed envelopes will not be beneficial for justice
" ’sibiai ke suzav ko khaarij karte hue peeth ne kaha, ‘adaalat kii kaarywahi, maamle kii sunwaayee or adaalat kaa aadesh kisi aalochana se prabhavit nahin hote
 Whether it is the lower court or the Supreme Court, he has to work with his intelligence keeping in mind the constitution and public interest

 Addressing the National Minorities Conference of Congress, Rahul Gandhi fiercely attacked PM Modi and BJP as well as RSS RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat
 rahul gandhi ne piem narendra modi (PM Modi) par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki kisi bhi desh ke piem ko todane vaala nahin, jodne vaala hona chahie, nahin to aise piem ko hataa dena chahie
 Rahul Gandhi said that RSS wants to run the country from Nagpur
 rahul gandhi ne piem modi par hamalaa bolaa or ek baar phir se dibet karne kii chunauti di
 Rahul Gandhi said that "make me argue with Modi ji, he will run away, he is a coward"
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki aap narendra modi kaa cheharaa dhyaan se dekhenge to dikhegaa ki unke chehre par ghabrahat he
 Narendra Modi has come to know that India cannot be ruled by dividing the country and spreading hatred
 hindustan ke pradhanmantri ko desh ko jodne kaa kaam kar karnaa chahie, agar vah aisa nahin karte hai to unhen hataa dena chahie
 Five years ago it was said that Narendra Modi ji has a 56 inch chest, he will rule for 15 years
 aaj congress party ne narendra modi kii pratishtha kii dhajjiyaan uda di hai
 Whether it is about the farmer, it is about the worker, it is about the poor, it is about corruption, wherever you will see the truth of Modi ji, Congress workers have told the country
 2019 main narendra modi, bhaajapa or aresas ko congress haraane ja rahi he
 Let us tell you that on January 11, the Modi government made a big bet after consensus could not be reached on the triple talaq bill

 It was approved in the meeting chaired by PM Modi
 bataa den ki teen talaak ko aparaadh qaraar die jane vaale adhyadesh kii miyaad 22 janvari ko khatm ho rahi thi
 In the current session of Parliament, an attempt was made to pass a bill related to triple talaq
 lekin rajyasabha main vipaksh ne ise paas nahin hone diya tha
 The opposition argued that the government had introduced it in a hurry, there was no consensus of all parties on this
 isse pehle sansad ke sheet satr main bhi raajnneetik gatirodh kii vajah se teen talaak bill rajyasabha main latak gaya tha
 In the absence of a majority in the Rajya Sabha, the government could not move this bill further
 vipaksh bill ko select cameti ko bhejne kii apni maang par ada rahaa
 The government's attempt to get the triple talaq bill passed in the Rajya Sabha on 31 January was thwarted
 vipaksh teen talaak bill main bade badlaav kii maang kar rahaa tha or sadan main charchaa se pehle select cameti kii maang par data rahaa
 Whereas the government rejected the opposition's demand
 rajyasabha main vipaksh ke upanetaa anand sharma ne sarkaar par ek samvedansheel masale par raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha, jabaki sarkaar ne kaha tha ki vipaksh is baat se dar gaya he ki ye kanoon banane se muslim mahilaayein modi sarkaar kaa samarthan karengi

 For 99 percent of the people, becoming Prime Minister will be an impossible dream come true, but for a small number of people, it is a minor thing for very few people to do so
 sonia gandhi ne putravadhu ke rup main ek pradhanmantri ke awaas main pravesh kiya tha, duusare pradhanmantri ke awaas main patni ke rup main raheen, or antat us sthiti main pahunchin, jahaan vah yah tay kar sakin ki aglaa pradhanmantri koun banegaa
 Rahul Gandhi was born in his grandmother's prime minister's residence, grew up in his father's prime minister's residence, and then did politics as the son of the country's most powerful leader
 yahi baat priyanka gandhi wadra par bhi lagu hoti he
 It is too late for him to say, he will be the Prime Minister, but the issue is whether he wants this
 
 
 ? kya yah pad unhen bhi is tarah lalachaata hoga, jis tarah ham sabko lalachaata he
 i remember i met Priyanka at 10, Janpath in 1999, when she was standing at a window
 maine poocha ki kya vah aane vaale chunaav main khadi hongi, unhone turant jawaab diya, "philhal to main sirf is khidki main khadi hum
 
 
 " mujhe yah bhi yaad he ki kis tarah mujhe khud ko baar-baar yaad dilaanaa padataa tha ki jis shaks ke saath main baitha hum, vah doon skool kaa koi saathi nahin, desh kaa pradhanmantri he
 It was astonishing to see how quickly a person can adjust to the functioning of a large post, and how soon this big post can remain a minor thing for him
 yah baaten hamen us vakt yaad rakhni hongi, jab ham sambhddha party dwaara baar-baar spasht jawaab de chukne ke baavjood prayek vyakti ke dimag main uthne vaale sawaal - kya priyanka 'haa' kahengi yaa 'nahin' - kaa jawaab dhundne kii koshish karenge
 Well, they have said - no
 
 
 so, ham log is mudde ko yaheen par khatm kyon nahin kar sakate
 
 
 The lekin, isi ke saath atakalbaaji kaa daur shuru ho gaya
 
 
 Arun Jaitley termed Priyanka's possible entry into politics as 'coup in the palace', as if she knew everything
 kisi ko bhi bhai or bahan ke is jode kii ek saath khinchi tasveeron ko sirf dekhnebhar se asaliyat kaa ehsaas ho saktaa he - donon bhai-bahan ek-duusare se kitna pyaar karte hai, donon bhai-bahan ek-duusare kaa kis kadar sahaara hai, donon bhai-bahan ek-duusare par kis tarah nirbhar karte hai
 
 
 And some outsider like Arun Jaitley starts calling it a rivalry to bake his political rot, which will not even know what is going on in the party, and what is not
 is par koi do raay nahin ho saktin ki priyanka party ke liye behad beshkeemtee hai
 No one has even the slightest doubt that the party wants his participation from the innermost
 yah baat party kaaryakartaaon or matadaataaon ko utsahit karti hai ki unhen dekhakar indira gandhi kii yaad aati he, or unhen sunakar rajeev gandhi kii yaaden moort ho uthati hai
 It is certain that he will always be welcomed wholeheartedly in the party, even most of the Congressmen will be wooing him
 lekin ham koun hote hai, unhen yah bataane ke liye ki vah apane 'bhagya main bade' pad kii taraf badhen yaa nahin
 It depends on them, and only on them
 agar vah kisi bhi kaaran se yah nirnay karti hai ki vah abhi - yaa kabhi bhi - aisa nahin chaahatin, to unka saath paae bina aage badhane ke atirikt party ke paas koi vikalp nahin he
 Or, to be frank, grow up with him to some extent, because he is the one in charge of his mother and brother's constituencies, where despite the efforts made by Narendra Modi to come out of the realm of humility at the last minute Won
 vah modi the, jinhen amethi or raibareli se dum dabaakar bhaagna padaa tha
 One can be a profound politician without being in politics
 priyanka donon hi hai - gahan rajaneta bhi, raajnneeti se baahar bhi
 But this is not always the case
 ho saktaa he, kisi din unhen lage ki parivaar ke prati unhone apni zimmedaariyaan puri kar lee hai, or ab vah raajnneeti ke daldal main paanv rakh sakati hai
 But it may also happen that the day never comes, at least not in the rest of the political life of aged leaders like me
 parantu yuva ho yaa vayovruddh - hamamen se kisi ke liye bhi yah katai aniatik hoga ki ham priyanka kii zindagi ke bare main atkal lagaaein, or unhen bataaen ki unke paas ek haari hui party kii madad ke liye saamne aane ke alaava koi vikalp nahin bachaa he
 This decision will be entirely their own
 thik usee tarah, jaise vah unki maa kaa tha
 It is not too long, when many of us (including Natwar Singh) were constantly urging Sonia to take over the party
 hamane sochaa tha, unka shokkaal ek saal kaa hoga, lekin vah uske baad bhi apane duhkhon ke bhavar main ghiri raheen
 The party broke up (led by Natwar Singh)
 vah tus se mas nahin huin
 When Sitaram Kesari disappointed PV Narasimha Rao, including many of me, after the election scenario was reversed in 1996, Sonia still kept the doors of 10, Janpath tightly closed
 phir shuru hua congress kaa vighatan, jisamen meraa mamata banerjee ke saath chale janaa shaayad shuruaati pathar kaa ludhakna tha, jo dhire-dhire hiskhalan main badal gaya
 And then, while walking around her house, Sonia saw pictures of her husband and in-laws, who inspired her to save the party that she had done so much to raise her fears, despite her fears
 yah kartavya kii pukaar thi, jo unhen sakriy raajnneeti main lekar ai
 How was the media ridiculed at that time
 
 
 kis tarah ek pramukh mahila rajaneta ne yah chetavanee dekar sabhi mahilaon ko nicha dikhaaya tha ki agar koi videshi swatantra bharat kaa pradhanmantri bana to vah sir mundava lengi
 
 
 How the person who selectively abused them was also seen standing on his doorstep without calling, when he started a 10-year exile for the self-styled 'ram bhaktas', beating the stubborn NDA
 isliye, hamamen se kisi ko bhi priyanka se anurodh karne, unhen manaane ko koshish karne, yaa unhen dhamkaane kii katai koi zarurat nahin he
 He is nehru-gandhi
 unhen unke kartavya acchhee tarah maaloom hai
 When the need arises - and the need arises only when we are in deep trouble - they will know that the time has come for them to come forward
 agar ham khud ko maujuuda sthiti se baahar laakar paristhitiyon ko saamaanya kar sake - jo katai sambhav he - to priyanka aaraam se sofe par baithkar apni pasandida kitaaben padhate hue vakt bitaati rah sakati hai
 Anyway, it is clear that he is with the Congress in spirit
 vah party main shaamil hoti hai yaa nahin, yah puri tarah unhen hi tay karnaa he
 And whatever his decision, now or in the future, it will always be in the interest of the party
 "or haa, bijepi main baithe 'ashubhachintakon' ke liye bhi 'namo' kaa jaadu utarataa ja rahaa he
 
 
 Of the three by-elections held after the change of power at the Center, all have gone in favor of the Congress
 
 
 or 'modi ke mahaan bhram' se hue nuksaan kii bachi-khuchi bharpai bhi aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main ho jaaegi
 
 
 " jansadharan ke saath-saath bijepi ke duusari pankti ke netaaon ke bich bhi chunavi raajnneeti ke 'gogia pasha' ko lekar bana hua matibhram dhire-dhire dur hota jayega
 Within a year or two from now, the definite defeat of the Sangh Parivar will start to be seen even in the understanding of ordinary people
 us vakt bijepi, jaisaa ham aaj uttar pradesh main dekh rahe hai, bajrang dal or anya kii madad se sampradayik card khelegi
 At that time Priyanka will play her role
