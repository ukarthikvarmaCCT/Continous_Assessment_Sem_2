 Since Narendra Modi became Prime Minister in 2014, Ahmedabad has emerged as a center for hosting the world's biggest leaders
 china ke raashtrapati shi jinping, japan ke pradhanmantri shinjo abe or ab isroyal ke pradhanmantri benjamin netanyahu kii mejabani pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ahmedabad main kii he
 In such a situation, the question arises that why is Ahmedabad so important for Prime Minister Narendra Modi? What is it that makes Ahmedabad so special for Modi, which indirectly becomes the second capital of India during diplomatic visits
 raajnneetik vishleshak maanate hai ki modi kii koshish gujarat ke vikaas ko duniya bhar ke netaaon ko dikhaane kii he
 There is an effort to establish Gujarat's industry against any industrial regions of the world
 aarthik aankadon ko dekhen, to gujarat, industry ke maamle main desh kaa sarvopari rajya he or yahaan kii jidipi rashtriya sakal utpaada main sabase mahatvapurn yogadan rakhti he
 BJP leader GVL Narasimha Rao has given a new diplomacy to New India
 ve kehete hai ki agar pradhanmantri paramparaagat tareeke se mejabaanon ko host karte, to shaayad itani kawarej nahin milti
 Nor did the eyes of the world go on developing in other parts of the country
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki dwipaksheeya sambandhon kii mejabani sadakon par karne se janata bhi isamen shaamil hoti he or do deshon ke sambandhon main jeevantta aati he
 However, the diplomat Rajiv Dogra does not seem to agree with gvl's statement
 dogra kehete hai ki thik he ki aap do deshon ke sambandhon main public ko shaamil karnaa chaahate hai, lekin do deshon ke sambandhon main pratikatmak chijen bahut mahatvapurn nahin hoti hai
 Your partner country does not give all these things much priority
 pehali baar sitambar 2014 main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne china ke raashtrapati shi jinping kii ahmedabad main mejabani kii thi
 Xi Jinping, who arrived in Ahmedabad on a one-day tour, received a royal welcome at the Sabarmati River Front
 bharat-china sambandhon main chaahe jitna utaar chadhaav ho, lekin jab bhi modi kii mejabani kii baat aati he, to jinping ko jhula jhulaate modi kii tasviren aaj bhi tivi screen par tairti najar aati hai
 In September 2017, once again Prime Minister Narendra Modi chose Ahmedabad to host, this time the guests were special close to Modi and Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe

 At the same time, the Prime Minister also showed Shinzo Abe to the Sabarmati River Front developed during his Chief Minister's term
 shi jinping, abe ke baad ab pradhanmantri narendra modi ne isroyal ke pradhanmantri benjamin netanyahu kii mejabani kii he
 There is a lot of Modi's sabotage with Netanyahu and after Modi's visit to Israel, a new warmth is seen in india-israel relations
 raajnneetik vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki dilli ke bajaay ahmedabad or gandhinagar main vaishvik netaaon kii mejabani karne kaa piem modi kaa agenda saaf he
 His aim is to show the development of Ahmedabad and to seal the model of development with his ambitious projects as Chief Minister
 haalanki yah baat dhyaan rakhi jaani chahie ki indira gandhi or atal bihari vaajapeyi ne bhi bade maukon par apane mehmaanon ko dilli ke baahar host kiya he

 Former Bihar Chief Minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Rabri Devi answered the questions being raised on her son and former deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav
 shuukravaar ko rabari devi ne kaha ki tejasvi yadav jald hi waapas aaenge
 He is currently busy with some work
 wo bekaar nahin baithe hai
 Let me tell you that since the bitter defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, Tejashwi Yadav has gone into unknown position
 isko lekar lagaataar sawaal uth rahe hai
 On the other hand, the parties involved in the NDA had a spectacular victory in Bihar
 bihar kii kul 40 loksabhaa siton main se 39 siton par bijepi ke netritv main endie gathbandhan ne jeet hasil kii thi
 This time RJD contested the Lok Sabha elections in the absence of Lalu Prasad Yadav
 lalu prasad yadav chaara ghotaale maamle main jail kii sajaa kaat rahe hai
 Recently, when senior RJD leader Abdulbari Siddiqui was questioned about Tejashwi Yadav going into exile, he said that he does not know where Tejashwi Yadav is? Earlier RJD national vice-president Raghuvansh Prasad Singh had said that Tejashwi Yadav may have gone to London to watch the World Cup
 unhone kaha tha ki argedy netaa or bihar ke purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav cricketer rahe hai or cricket main unki kaaphi dilchaspee he
 Apart from this, when the issue was questioned with rjd's ally Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) party president and former Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, he said, 'tejashwi Yadav may not be able to bear the brunt of defeat 
 lihaaja wo agyatavaas main chale gaye hai
 He is not experienced like us and Lalu Prasad Yadav, that is why he is living in seclusion
 'jeethanram maanjhi ne yah bhi daawa kiya tha ki tejasvi yadav ne loksabhaa chunaav main 225 sabhaayen kii thi, lekin chunaav kaa nateeja behad kharaab rahaa
 Perhaps Tejashwi Yadav is tired physically and mentally due to these election meetings
 lihaaja wo aaraam kar rahe hai
 However, it is decided by when he will return

 Govindacharya has written a letter to the Chief Justice regarding the deaths due to demonetisation and demanded acceptance of letter petitions
 govindacharya ne kaha ki sarkaar ne artical 21 (rhite tu life) kaa ullaghann kiya he, isliye peediton ko uchit muaavja dene kaa court nirdesh den
 In the letter, Govindacharya has written that he had sent a legal notice to the Economic Affairs Secretary of the Government of India on 17 November and told about the legal deficiency in the demonetization process
 saath hi isamen marane vaale logon ke liye muaavje kii maang kii thi, teen din main notice kaa jawaab maanga tha or ye kaha tha kii agar sarkaar kii taraf se jawaab nahin aayaa to ye mana jayega kii jo aarope lagaae hai unako sarkaar ne sweekaar kar liya he
 Now because the government has not given any answer, let me accept this letter as a court letter petition
 court ne kiya tha yachikaaon par roak lagane se inkaarhal hi main supreme court ne bhi notebandi par daayar yachikaaon par sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha he kii log behad pareshaan hai isi vajah se vibhinn hai court main yachikaaon par chal rahi sunwaayee par supreme court ne roak nahin lagaai he
 According to media reports, 70 people have died so far due to the wrongly implemented demonetization process
 jabaki baaki log sarkaar ke is bure faisle kii vajah se aarthik rup se prabhavit ho rahe hai
 Poor and downtrodden people are denied their financial security and cannot even formally petition in the Supreme Court due to financial constraints
 court khud le maamle kaa sangyansupreme court se govindacharya ne guzarish kii he ki court khud sangyaan le kar is maamle par sunwaayee kare
 Due to lack of cash, farming is getting affected, problems in weddings and patients are getting difficulty in treatment
 ye artical 21 kaa ulanghan he or ek majaak ban gaya he ye adhikaar jo samvidhan ne aam nagarikon ko diya he
 The present situation is nothing but the implementation of the economic emergency in the undisclosed form
 kyonki centre sarkaar rigerv bank of india act ke section 26(1) ke tahat desh ke logon ko di gai guarantee ko honor karne main naakaam he
 Govindacharya has demanded from the Supreme Court that this letter be included as a petition along with other petitions filed in the court
 court sabhi rajyon se report maange kii ab tak kitne logon kii maut notebandi kii vajah se hui or kitne log isaki vajah se prabhavit hue hai
 The court intervenes in this matter so that the fundamental rights of the citizens of the country are protected

 At Centurion ground, South Africa beat Team India by 135 runs to take an unassailable 2–0 lead in the three-match Test series
 isi ke saath hi test formet main lagaataar 10veen siries jeet ke sapane lekar ai viraat brigade kaa sapana bhi tut gaya
 Not only this, Team India wanted to create history by winning the Test series after 25 years in Africa, but due to some wrong decisions of the captain and team management, this could not be possible
 captain or team management ne is match main teen prayog kiye the, lekin teenon hi fail sabit hue
 1
 dhawan kii jagah rahul:centurian test main viraat kohli ne shikhar dhawan ko drop kar lokesh rahul ko mauka diya tha, yah sochakar ki vah ran banaaenge lekin unka pradarshan to shikhar dhawan se bhi kharaab rahaa
 Rahul has scored only 14 runs in both innings of the Centurion Test
 duusari pari main lokesh rahul ke ghatiya shot se unki jagah par sawaal paidaa hota he
 2
 rahane ko plaing ilevan se baahar rakhana:team india ke up-captain ajinkya rahane ko captain kohli ne lagaataar do match maichon main nahin khilaayaa or rohit sharma ko sharmnaak pradarshan ke baavjood plaing ilevan main mauka diya
 It was a decision that cost India dearly
 rahane kaa south africa kii dharti par record kisi se chipa nahin he
 Team India has definitely missed Rahane in this match
 3
 Relying on Parthiv Patel more than Wriddhiman Saha: Captain Virat Kohli showed more confidence in Parthiv Patel's batting than Wriddhiman Saha's wicketkeeping skills
 specialist wicketiper saaha kii jagah parthiv patel ko plaing ilevan main shaamil karne kaa faisla puri tarah se flop rahaa
 Parthiv Patel was disappointed with his batting performance as well as two catches behind the wicket
 team india ke paas yah test siries jeetne kaa acha mauka tha, kyonki uske tej gendbaajon ne ab tak siries main south africa ko donon hi maichon main do baar ol out kiya he
 But the batsmen's flop show has worked on him

 Let us tell you that the Government of India recently issued a circular, due to which the program 'thank You India' in New Delhi was shifted to Dharamshala
 yah kaarykram tibetiyon ke aadhyatmik guru dalai lamas ke nirvaasan kii 60veen jayanti par hone vaala tha
 Sangay said he understands the sensitivity of the decision
 isi maamle par saange ne kaha, 'haa, hamane circular dekha or ham in paristhitiyon ko samajhate hai
 The Dalai Lama has always said that we do not want to create any inconvenience or trouble for anyone, including India
 ham bharat or china samet sabhi padosiyon se achche sambandh chaahate hai
 Therefore, if there is any problem being created by the Chinese side, then we have no problem with the shift of the program
 ham jaanate hai ki china is maamle par kaaphi sensetive he
 Sangay said, 'china behaves like a spoiled big brother
 yah hameshaa samvedansheel rahata he
 Whatever we do, go anywhere, say anything, China always makes a statement on it
 ve bharat sarkaar se isaki shikaayat karte rahete hai
 Therefore, we understand the circular of the Government of India
 ' haalanki, bharat sarkaar ne saaf kiya he ki vah tibet or dalai lamas par apni niti main koi badlaav nahin karegaa
 Let me tell you that the Cabinet Secretary of India had asked all the government officials to stay away from the Dalai Lama's program
 unhone 22 farvari ko videsh sachiv ke khat ke hawaale se kaha tha ki china kii samvedansheeltaa ko dekhte hue sabhi sarkari adhikari is kaarykram se dur rahen
 After this, the program 'thank You India' in Delhi was shifted to Dharamshala
 haalanki, isamen bharat sarkaar ke alaava kai raajnneetik dalon ke pratinidhiyon ne bhi hissaa liya or tibet ko apana samarthan jataayaa tha
 Lobsang Sangay has said, 'thank you India Minister Mahesh Sharma ji on behalf of the Government of India and my friends Ramadhav ji and Shanta Kumar ji from BJP, Minister of Himachal Government and Satyavrat Chaturvedi from Congress came
 asal baat yahi he kiis kaarykram main sabhi ahm logashamil hue
 He said that such programs and cultural festivals not only reveal the struggles of Dalai Lama, but also tell the ground reality
 saange ne kaha, 'china kii sarkaar daawa karti he ki usne tibet ko samaajwaad ke swarg main badal diya he, lekin freedom house index bataata he ki syria main sabase kam aazaadee hasil he or is maamle main doosraa number tibet kaa he
 South Sudan and Eritrea also follow it
 iskaa matlab he ki yahaan shi jinping ke netritv main maanavadhikaron kaa ulanghan, paryaavaran ko nasht karnaa or saanskrithik daman jari he
 ' kehete hai ejams achche-acchon kii niden uda dete hai

 Everyone is known for her commitment and dedication to Kangana, when she takes up a task she does it diligently

 Udayanraje Bhosle had joined the BJP to join the NCP just before the election in Satara Lok Sabha seat, but the move has turned Udayan Raje Bhosle upside down
 bataa den ki udayan raaje chhatrapati shivaji ke vanshaj hai or bijepi ko ummid thi ki wo chunaav main party ke liye trump card sabit honge lekin rujhaanon main aisa hota hua nahin dikh rahaa he
 During the election campaign in Satara on 19 October, amidst thunderstorms, Sharad Pawar said, 'this is the blessing of Varuna Raja for NCP

 Prior to the torrential rains, senior party leaders present on the stage were initially dispersed

 Delhi can become an arena of war once again

 Recalling the 49-day tenure of the AAP government, Kejriwal said, 'in those 49 days, we had taken action against about 50 officers inside Delhi through ACB
 pulisavaalon ne rishwat lenaa band kar diya tha
 But on 8 June last year, the central government took control of Nemukesh Meenako as ACB Chief
 'unhone kaha ki 49 dinon ke dauraan hamane mukesh ambani se lekar purv siem shila dikshit tak ke khilaaf exiaar darj karai thi, lekin ab asibi kaa control centre ke paas he

 gauratlab he ki 2008 main crude oil abtak ke sarvaadhik str 145 dollar prati bairal par thi
 At the same time, the price of crude oil reached $ 30 per barrel due to ongoing dispute in Gulf countries during 2015 and 2016 and lack of demand in developing countries including China
 ise padhein: kya modi sarkaar ko 2019 main chunauti degaa 100 rupee litre vaala petrol?oisidi kii yah bhavishyavaanee kaa aadhaar he ki aane vaale varshon main china or bharat jaisi arthvyavasthaaen raftaar pakadaney ke liye indhan ke maang main bada ijapha kar sakati he
 Petrol will be 100 rupees a liter without even $ 100 crude? In India, the price of petrol does not necessarily touch this level to cross the 100 rupees
 beete teen saal tak desh main crude kii keemat or kendra or rajya sarkaron dwaara liya ja rahaa tex petrol kii keemat ko usee samay 100 rupee tak pahunchaa saktaa he jab ek baar phir crude oil 2014 ke str yani 100 dollar prati bairal ko chhu le
 Read this: The stock market may fall in 2018 on these 5 issues, including crude oil, GST is implemented in the country in July 2017 but petrol-diesel prices are kept out of the GST ambit
 aisa isliye kiya gaya ki petrol-dijal par rajyon dwaara lagaaya ja rahaa tex unke vaarshik revenue kaa bada hissaa he
 After it is brought under GST, it will start selling at a price by levying central tax on petrol and diesel across the country

 In addition, it can also cause problems in the middle bone of the ear
 shodh ke dauraan aise pratibhaagiyon main sunne kii kshamta kamjor pai gai jinamein aayran kii kami thi

 shodhakartaaon ne kaha ki aayran kii kami se hone vaala hearing loss mastishk ko bhi prabhavit kar saktaa he
 If a person stays in an iron deficient situation for a long time, then his ability to understand and think can also be affected

 pichhali do baar kii champion bhartiya team ipoh main paanch se 15 may tak hue ajalan shah cap main chathe sthaan par rahi
 "we have to qualify for the London Olympics 2012 at all costs," said Bhaskaran, the captain of the Indian team that won the eighth and last gold medal at the Moscow Olympics (1980)
 beijing olympic 2008 nahin khel paane kii sharmindagi dobaaraa nahin jhelni he lekin iske liye team ko yuva khilaadiyon kii jarurat he
 "the pool of players was almost the same when i was a coach and there hasn't been much change in five years," said Bhaskaran, who was India's coach for the last time in the 2006 World Cup in Germany
 hamaare yahaan pratibhaaon kii kami nahin he lekin hockey india or iechaef ke aapasi satta sangharsh ko bhulaakar unhen mauka dene kii jarurat he
 "there was a lack of midfielder Sardara Singh in the Azlan Shah Cup but we have to have backup of 3-4 players for every position," he said
 yah prakriya abhi tak shuru nahin ho saki he
 If the regular drag flicker Sandeep Singh was in the team, then Rupinder Pal Singh, who came from the junior team, would not have got a chance and he would have remained a hidden talent
 bhaskaran ne kaha, khilaadiyon kaa pool bada karne ke liye kshetreey aadhaar par toornament karaaye jane jaruri he
 No one knows on what basis the players are selected for the national camp
 trial main adhik khilaadiyon ko shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 He said, Jose Brasa's complaint after me and me is that there are not many options for selection
 nae coach (harendra singh) ko yah dayera badhanaa chahie tabhi pradarshan main sudhaar aayega
 He also blamed the players for the poor performance in the Azlan Shah Cup, saying, "we did well in pieces

 Shahid said, after losing the tournament, it is an excuse that the new players were given a chance
 meraa maananaa he ki olympic kwalifire se pehle koi prayog nahin hona chahie
 We have to somehow avoid the embarrassment of not qualifying for the Olympics by qualifying for the London Olympics 2012
 unhone kaha, iske liye jaruri he ki har toornament main apni majboot team utaari jaae taaki jeet ke saath aatmavishvaas bade
 The people of Hindustan have longed to see the team win
 yadi yahi haal rahaa to ek din bhartiya hockey khatm ho jaaegi or naa hi koi is khel ko apnayega

 saurashtra-kutch and Dakshina tell that the first phase voting for the political battle of Gujarat is considered very important for both BJP and Congress
 saurashtra kii 54 vidhansabha siten he or dakshin gujarat kii 35 vidhansabha siten hai

 The independence of the judiciary is the basic structure of the constitution
 lekin sansadeey samprabhutaa bhi na sirf jaruri buniyadi dhaancha he balki loktantr kii aatma bhi he
 This was the decision of the Supreme Court

 You must also be surprised by this, but the people here believe that every day this idol of Ganapati is increasing its size

 Shri Lakshmamma, a devotee of Vinayak, presented him with a shield, but due to the increasing size of the statue, it has become difficult to wear it now
 nadi ke chamatkaar bhi kam nahinsirf murti hi nahin balki jis nadi ke bichon bich vinayak virajman hai wo bhi chamatkaar kii nit nai kahaniyaan likhti he
 It is said that the devotees attend the court of Ganapati even on every day's quarrel
 choti-choti galtiyaan na karne ke liye bhi bhakt baqayada shapath bhi lete hai
 But before reaching the court of the Lord, devotees have to take a dip in the river

 Both were exhausted due to the long journey, the author was very hungry while walking
 raste main use aam kaa ek ped dikhaa to wo aam todane ke liye machalane laga
 His brother Sankha stopped him from doing so but he did not agree

 america commando ke hamale ke dauraan agarosama bin ladenbullate pruf jacket main hota to bhi maaraa jaataa
 If he had been without clothes, that is, he would not have been wearing any clothes, he might have survived
 shaayad commando use jinda giraftaar kar apane saath america le jate
 Unfortunately, Osama was wearing clothes at that time
 wo kapade jinase america daraa hua tha
 The cloth made of Laden's enemy gives recognition to a human being, but it is respected but have you heard that cloth should become the enemy of someone's life? This may sound strange, but it is true that this fabric took the life of the world's most dreaded terrorist, Osama bin Laden
 agar osama nanga hota to jinda batch saktaa tha
 By the way, Osama was killed in the commando operation of the US Navy seals Team 6
 lekin is oparation ke baad bhi osama batch saktaa tha
 Provided he was without clothes i
e
 naked
 jaanate hai kyon?america khufia agency siie ne oparation gerenimo ikiya ko anjaam dene vaale conmados ko saaf nirdesh diya tha ki osama-bin-laden ko tabhi jinda pakadaa jaae
 When he is ready to surrender without clothes
 yani wo puri tarah se nanga ho
 According to CIA director Leon Peneta, he did not trust Osama at all
 wo use kuch bolne tak kaa mauka nahin dena chaahate the
 He feared that the bomb might have been hidden in the clothes of the dreaded Osama
 wo yidi laga hua jacket pahana ho saktaa he
 a weapon may be hidden inside the cloth
 or aise main pakade jane kii haalat main wo suicide bam ban kar apane aasapaas maujuud har cheez ko uda saktaa tha
 On the night of May 1, when the US attacked this mansion in Abbottabad, Osama was sleeping in a Pathani suit
 thodi si mashkkat ke baad wo vakt bhi gaya jab nihattha osama commando ke nishane par aa gaya tha
 But far from taking off clothes, he was also opposed to their capture
 america commando ke paas vakt itnaa vakt nahin tha ki wo se bahes karte
 So the commandos, without losing any time and taking any threat, decided to kill him directly
 or phir use usee tarah maaraa gaya jaise kisi suicide bombar ko maaraa jaataa he
 Without a chance, Seams Team 6's Kammado fired two bullets into Osama's head
 ise dabl trep kehete hanosama ne pehle hi elaan kar rakhaa tha ki america fouj se ghir jane par wo pakade jane ke bajaae maranaa pasand karegaa
 Nasir Al Bahiri, himself the bodyguard of Osama bin Laden, has also confirmed this
 nasir al bahiri ke mutabik agast 1998 main jab america hamale ho rahe the tab ek din laden ne apni revolver se do bullate nikaal kar use diya or sakht hidaayat dete hue kaha tha ki kabhi wo america dushmano se ghir jaae to uske sir main goli maar de
 Perhaps Osama was not allowed to be caught alive
 america jelon main janaa osama apni tauheen samajhataa tha
 After clothes, now talk
 usee kothi kii jisamen osama maaraa gaya or jise bahut se log osama kii haveli bhi kehete hai
 Osama entered the three-story Kothi five years ago
 or ek baar is kothi main ghusane ke baad wo ek baar bhi kothi ke baahar nahin niklaa
 Even inside the Kothi, he kept himself imprisoned in only two rooms
 pakistan ne guruuvar ko aakhirkaar ye maan hi liya ki ossam bin laden abtabad kii is haveli main pichley paanch saalon se rah rahaa tha
 And this mansion was built six years ago only to hide it
 pakistan sarkaar ne guruuvar ko kuch chuninda sampadakon ko bula kar oparation osama ke baad ke ghatnakram ke bare main unhen puri jakaari di
 According to Pakistan, he got information about the operation on the night of May 1 when the helicopter crash and gunshots were heard
 magar jab tak local police maukey par pahunchati america commando duusare helicopter main vahaan se ud chuke the
 After this, when the police entered inside the mansion, there was a fire in one part of the mansion
 jabaki haveli ke andar bahut se bachche or auraten dare-sahame alag-alag kamaron main dubake hue the
 Till then the police themselves did not even know that this is Osama bin Laden's mansion
 magar phir jab der raat white house se islamabad ko oparation kii khabar di gai tab kahin jaakar paak sena or paak khufia agency aisai harakat main ai or fouran aalaa afasaron ko abtabad daudaya gaya
 The Pak government told the editors that all the people present in the mansion were first taken to the hospital
 iske baad jab unase poochtacha kii gai to pataa chalaa ki unamem teen osama kii bevaa hai jabaki ek beti
 One of them, Osama's Bewa of Yemen, told Pak officials that Osama had come to this mansion in Abbottabad from Afghanistan five years ago
 or tab se wo yaheen rah rahaa tha
 In these five years, even if he was out of the house, he used to stay confined in only two rooms inside the house
 or ye donon hi kamare teesri manzil par the
 According to Osama's bewa, Osama never went to the compound or even below
 yahaan tak ki wo khuli chat par bhi kabhi nahin gaya
 Even inside the mansion, not everyone was allowed to go to Osama's room i
e
 the third floor
 sirf uski biviyaan or bachche hi uske kamare tak ja sakate the
 The Pak government also told that the commandos had stormed the mansion at the time when the three wives of Osama were on the first and second floors
 jabaki 12 saal kii uski beti duusari manzil par osama ke saath thi
 And Osama was shot in front of the same daughter
 ek may kii raat america ke navy sil commando ne kaise osama ko maar giraaya ye ab duniya jaan gai he
 But do you know that in this operation to eliminate Osama, a unique jambaz also played a very important role? Yes yes osama ko maarane gai team ke saath ek kutta bhi tha
 And because of this dog, the commandos were able to sneak into Osama's hideout
 ek may kii raat america ke navy sil commandon apane sabase bade mishan kii ore bad rahe the
 It was reported that America's biggest enemy is hiding in a house in Abbottabad area of pakistan
 is hamale se pehle navy sil team sicks ke commando ne maheene bhar kadi training kii thi
 But then he did not really know how the enemy would respond to his attack
 taiyaari badi thi kyonki saamana tha aatank ke sabase bade chehre osama bin laden se
 The ten-year-old search for America was nearing completion, so American commandos did not want any lapse
 is mishan main khatre kai the
 No one knows how much substance and ammo Osama had hidden in his hideout
 hamale par osama kis tarah kii javaabi karrwai karegaa ye bhi nahin maaloom tha
 The biggest danger was that Laden should not attack the Navy SEAL commandos from inside the house with arms
 navy sil commando ko aise khataron se bachaane ke liye unke saath aayaa tha ek chaar pair kaa jaanbaaj
 The British newspaper The Sun claims that American commandos had brought a German Shepherd dog with them to attack Osama's hideout
 akhbaar kii maane to osama ke thikaane main sabase pehle ye kutta hi ghusaa tha
 This German Shepherd sniffed and tried to know where the gunpowder was and where the people were hiding
 kute ko bhejkar navy sil ke commando ye aashwast ho janaa chaahate the ki unke dushman ne ghar main barood bicha kar commando par hamale kii taiyaari to nahin kii thi
 The newspaper claims that the commandos had entered Laden's hideout only after receiving a signal from the dog
 ek baar jab commando ye samaj gaye ki unke raste main koi barudi sajeesh nahin bichhi he tab wo bedadak ghar ke andar ghuse or phir agle 25 minute main apane sabase bade torget ko goliyon se chalni kar diya
 The newspaper also claims that the dog that the Navy SEAL commandos took with them should be the dog of their combat tracker brigade
 ek saal pehle hi taiyaar kii gai is brigade ke kute kisi bhi insaan ke kadamon ke nishaan yaa khun kii ek boond bhi soongh kar us tak pahunch sakate hai
 It is being claimed that the Navy SEAL commandos took this dog with them so that if Osama tries to escape, he can be caught
 helicopter kii aawaaj sun kar yaa phir commando karrwai ke dauraan kisi bhi tarah agar osama apane thikaane se nikal bhaagane main kaamyaab ho jaataa tab bhi wo commando daste ke is saathi se zyada der tak nahin batch saktaa tha
 Sniffing his footsteps, this dog followed Osama and through him, the commandos of the Navy SEAL would find and kill him even in the streets of Abbottabad
 commando kisi bhi surat main is baar osma ko apane haath se nikalne nahin dena chaahate the, khabaron kii maane to yahi vajah thi ki wo apane saath apane team ke sabase vafaadaar or jambaz saathi ko bhi le gaye the
 Osama bin Laden, the world's most feared terrorist, never kept a phone with him
 use mobile phone se nafrat tha
 
 lekin uske paas har vakt hote the do immergency number
 After the death of Osama, the secret of these emergency numbers opened and the eyes of America were torn
 kya duniya kabhi osama kii maut kii tasviir dekh paaegi? ab tak ummid yahi thi ki white house duniya ko ye yakeen dalane ke liye ki osama mar chukaa he, uski tasviren zarur jari karegaa
 But the US has refused to release the photos saying that the photos are extremely gruesome and that its release could endanger American security

 As a road minister in the previous government, Gadkari, along with several states and ministries, had sorted out the hurdles between the ministries and speeded up government decisions

 -data ke galat istemaal ke bare main logon ko bataanaa –fasebuk ne kaha he ki company ab un logon ko un eps ke bare main bataaegi jinhone unke data kaa galat istemaal kiya he
 If Facebook removes such apps which misuse the user data, then in such a condition it will inform all the users about it
 -jin eps ko aap yuj nahin karte unka acces khatm kiya jayega –agar kisi ne pichley teen mahiinese fasebuk par kisi ap kaa istemaal nahin kiya he uskaa acces khatm kiya jayega taaki jaankaree uske saath share na ho sake
 -facebook login data will be restored -facebook login is changing so that in the next version, apps can not demand more data from users without review
 isamen yujar nem, profile photo or email adress shaamil he
 Apart from this, those apps will need the approval of Facebook for other data
 -logon ko eps ko manage karne ke liye bataanaa –ham abhi bhi logon ko yah dikhaate hai ki unke acount se kitne eps connected he or yugers ne jin jaankariyon ko un eps ke saath share kiya he use control kar sakate hai
 Now we will make it easier and better than before
 -fasebuk main khami dhundne waalon ko inaam –fasebuk bag bountiprogram kaa dayera badhaayaa jayega

 Of ISRO chief
 sivan ne kaha he ki team lander vikram se communication sthapit karne kii lagaataar koshish kar rahi he or jald hi sampark sthapit ho jayega
 According to the scientists, they have 12 days to contact Vikram
 ek anumaan ke mutabik isro ke paas vikram se sampark saadhane ke liye 12 din hai
 Because Lunar Day is going on right now
 ek lunar de dharti ke 14 dinon ke baraabar hota he
 Out of this, 2 days have passed
 yani agle 12 dinon tak chand par din rahegaa
 After that there will be night on the moon, which is equal to 14 days of Earth
 raat main usase sampark karne main dikkat hogi
 Then ISRO scientists will have to wait
 is bich, isro pramukh ke
 Sivan also said that we have come to know about Vikram Lander, he has been seen on the surface of the moon

 But no communication has been established yet
 ham sampark karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Please tell that ISRO has come to know the position of Vikram Lander on the moon
 orbitor ne thermal image camera se uski tasviir lee he
 However, no communication has been established with him yet
 ye bhi khabar he ki vikram lander landing vaali tay jagah se 500 meter dur padaa he
 The optical high resolution camera mounted in Chandrayaan-2's orbiter has taken a picture of Vikram Lander
 ab isro vaigyanik orbitor ke jariye vikram lander ko sandesh bhejne kii koshish kar rahe hai taaki, uskaa communication system on kiya ja sake
 Messages are constantly being sent to Vikram Lander and Orbiter from ISRO Center in Bangalore to start communication

 One of the reasons for this may also be that none of the small 4 steering engines on the side of the Vikram lander has worked
 isaki vajah se vikram lander apane tay maarg se daviet ho gaya
 The whole problem started from here, so scientists are studying this point

 Due to heavy rains in many parts of the state including Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh, public life has been badly affected
 barish ke kaaran nichali bastiyon main pani bhar gaya he, or avaagaman prabhavit hua he
 The state has been raining intermittently for the last 36 hours

 He spoke to the affected families and assured them of all possible help

 Surma of politics is taking all kinds of arrows from his quiver to beat each other
 bijepi is chunaav main soch samajhakar kisi ko bhi apana mukhyamantri ummidavaar ghoshit nahin karne kii ranneeti par chal rahi thi, lekin congress ne is mudde par hamalavar hokar baithe bithaae apane liye musiibat mol le lee he
 In fact, until the BJP had declared former Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal the Chief Ministerial face of the party in Himachal Pradesh, the battle was being considered as Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh vs Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 is ladaai main bijepi ko kaaphi raajnneetik nuksaan ho rahaa tha, kyonki rahul gandhi sahit kai bade party netaa notebandi or jiesti jaise mudde uchhaalkar inase naaraaz chal rahe aam logon sahit vyapaaree varg ko apane kareeb laane main kaaphi had tak kaamyaab ho chuke the
 As soon as the Congress declared Virbhadra Singh as its Chief Minister face, many party leaders started repeatedly raising the issue of not declaring the Chief Minister's face from the BJP
 himachal ke siyaasi galiyaaron main aise kayaas bhi lagaae jane lage ki bijepi kaa kendriya netritv haryana or uttar pradesh kii tarah himachal main bhi jeet hasil hone kii sthiti main mukhyamantri ke liye kisi nae chehre par daanv khelegaa
 Prior to such speculation, the Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumalka camp felt hurt and was unable to live up to the election campaign
 bijepi ke master ranneetikaar ne himachal pradesh pahunchate hi party kaaryakartaaon se feedback liya or paaya ki dhumal kii soobe ke har jile main sweekaaryata he
 It was also found that the other leaders whose names were being contested as the Chief Minister's contenders from the party were limited to their respective constituencies
 raajnneeti ke jaankaron ke mutabik amit shah ne dhumal ke naam par mukhyamantri chehre ke liye is vajah se bhi muhar lagaai, kyonki haryana or uttar pradesh main party haikaman ke pasandida mukhyamantri koi khaas cargujari nahin dikhaa paae
 However, the names of the Chief Ministers of these two states, whether they are Manohar Lal Khattar or Yogi Adityanath, were seen related to many controversies
 himachal ke mukhyamantrichehre ke liye bijepi kii ore se kendriya swasthya mantri jagat prakaash nadda ke naam kii charchaa bhi thi, lekin party alaakaman ne nadda ko bataur mukhyamantri cheharaa pesh karne ke bajaae unki yogyata kaa istemaal centre main hi karnaa behatar samajha, kyonki agle loksabhaa chunaav main bhi ab dedh saal kaa hi arsa bachaa he
 After proclaiming Dhumal as the face of the Chief Minister, there is undoubtedly a feeling of double enthusiasm among his supporters, but it is also a fact that there is not even a week left for campaigning
 aise main dhumal himachal ke kitne vidhansabha kshetron main matadaataaon ko sambodhit kar paaenge, is par sabaki najar rahegi
 It is also a challenge to contest from Dhumal new constituency this time
 bijepi ne is baar dhumal ko unki paramparaagat seat hamirpur kii jagah sujanpur se ummidavaar banaaya he
 The Bollywood industry has surprised the statement of ruling BJP MP Sajhi Maharaj at the Center on Wednesday
 sakshi maharaj ne kaha tha ki hindutv kii raksha karne ke liye sabhi hindu mahilaon ko 'chaar bachche' paidaa karne chahie
 Sakshi Maharaj said this in a public meeting in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh

 Film director Vikram Bhatt netted, 'shahi Maharaj wants all Hindu women to have four children
 acchhee khabar he, par unhone patiyon kii sankhya nahin bataai

 'kamedi actor vir das ne is maamle ko ek alag drushti se dekha
 He said, 'dear Sakshi Maharaj, as long as there is a child of Hindu women laughing at your speeches, we will be fine

 On the other hand, people like Sakshi Maharaj are talking about having four children
 unhen kahie ki pehle bacchon kii parvarish ke laayak vyavastha banaai jaae

 yahi vajah thi ki 17 saal kii naaballig umr main hi uske khilaaf police ne mukadmaa darj kiya
 a case of assault and illegal possession was registered against him at Surehi police station in Jaunpur
 iske baad munna ne kabhi palatakar nahin dekha
 He drifted into the morass of Jaraim
 80 ke dashak main kii thi pehali hatyamunna aparaadh kii duniya main apni pahchaan banane kii koshish main laga tha
 During this time, he got the patronage of Gajraj Singh, the local domineering mafia of Jaunpur
 munna ab uske liye kaam karne laga tha
 Meanwhile, in 1984, Munna killed a businessman for plunder
 uske munh khun lag chukaa tha
 After this, he showed his strength in Purvanchal by killing the BJP leader Ramchandra Singh of Jaunpur at the behest of Gajraj
 uske baad usne kai logon kii jaan lee
 Munna Bajrangi joined Purvanchal's Bahubali Mafia and politician Mukhtar Ansari's gang in the 90s to enhance his credibility in Munnapoornanchal, a special shooter of Mukhtar Ansari's gang
 yah gang mau se sanchalit ho rahaa tha, lekin iskaa asar puure purvanchal par tha
 Mukhtar Ansari ventured into politics from the world of crime and was elected MLA from Mau in 1996 on a Samajwadi Party ticket
 iske baad is gang kii takat bahut bad gai
 Munna was directly influencing government contracts
 vah lagaataar mukhtaar ansaari ke nirdesan main kaam kar rahaa tha
 Mukhtar Ansari occupied government contracts and recovery business in the enemy east
 lekin isi dauraan teji se ubharate bijepi ke vidhayak krishnanand raay unke liye chunauti banane lage
 Mukeshtar's enemy Brijesh Singh had his hands on them
 usee ke sangrakshan main krishnanand raay kaa gang fal phool rahaa tha
 This is why both the gangs were increasing their strength
 inke sambandh anderworld ke saath bhi jude gaye the
 Mukhtar did not like the growing influence of Krishnanand Rai
 unhone krishnanand raay ko khatm karne kii jimmedaari munna bajrangi ko saunp di
 Munna had murdered the BJP MLA, after getting the decree from Muhtar, Munna Bajrangi conspired to eliminate BJP MLA Krishnanand Rai
 or usee ke chalate 29 november 2005 ko mafia don mukhtaar ansaari ke kehane par munna bajrangi ne krishnanand raay ko din dahaade maut kii neend sula diya
 He, along with his colleagues, fired 400 shots from AK47 on two trains of Krishnanand Rai on the Lucknow highway
 is hamale main gajipur se vidhayak krishnanand raay ke alaava unke saath chal rahe 6 anya log bhi maare gaye the
 During the post-mortem, 60 to 100 bullets were recovered from the body of each deceased
 is hatyakand ne soobe ke siyaasi halkon main halchal machaa di
 Everyone started to fear after the name of Munna Bajrangi
 is hatya ko anjaam dene ke baad vah most wonted ban gaya tha
 In front of the murder of the MLA, the reward of lakhs was on Munna's head, in many cases Uttar Pradesh Police, STF and CBI were looking for Munna Bajrangi
 isliye us par saat lakh rupee kaa inaam bhi ghoshit kiya gaya
 He is charged with involvement in several cases of murder, kidnapping and recovery
 wo lagaataar apni lokation badalata rahaa
 Police pressure was also increasing
 mumbai main lee thi panaahaupi police or estf lagaataar munna bajrangi ko talash kar rahi thi
 It was difficult to live in UP and Bihar
 dilli bhi uske liye surakshit nahin tha
 So Munna ran away to Mumbai
 usne ek lanbaa arsa vahiin guzaara
 During this time he also had to go abroad many times
 uskunderworldake logon se rishte bhi majboot hote ja rahe the
 He was giving directions to his people on the phone from Mumbai itself
 raajnneeti main aajamaai kismatek baar munna ne loksabhaa chunaav main gajipur loksabhaa seat par apana ek dami ummidavaar khadaa karne kii koshish kii
 Munna Bajrangi was trying to get a woman ticket from Ghazipur to BJP
 jiske chalate uske mukhtaar ansaari ke saath sambandh bhi kharaab ho rahe the
 This was the reason that Mukhtar was not even helping his people
 bijepi se niraash hone ke baad munna bajrangi ne congress kaa daaman thama
 He went to the shelter of a powerful Congress leader
 congress ke vah netaa bhi jonpur jile ke rahane vaale the
 But lived in Mumbai and used to do politics
 munna bajrangi ne maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main netaa ji ko saport bhi kiya tha
 Such arrests were made in many states including Munna Uttar Pradesh, there were cases against Munna Bajrangi
 vah police ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban chukaa tha
 Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of cases against it
 lekin 29 oktober 2009 ko dilli police ne munna ko mumbai ke malad ilaake main naatakeey dhang se giraftaar kar liya tha
 It is believed that Munna was afraid of his encounter
 isliye usne khud ek yojana ke tahat dilli police se apni giraftaar karai thi
 The Mumbai Police was also involved in this operation of Munna's arrest at the last minute
 baad main dilli police ne kaha tha ki dilli ke vivaadaaspad encounter specialist rajbir singh kii hatya main munna bajrangi kaa haath hone kaa shaq he
 So he was arrested
 tab se use alag alag jail main rakhaa ja rahaa he
 During this time, cases like threatening, recovering people from his jail have also come up
 munna bajrangi kaa daawa he ki usne apane 20 saal ke aapraadhik jivan main 40 hatyaein kii hai
 Munna came out of the mouth of death In 1998, Delhi Police had an encounter in Badli area of delhi
 jisamen munna bajrangi ko kai goliyaan lagi thim
 Police had claimed at the time that Munna was killed in the encounter, but people were shocked then
 jab bajrangi ne ram manohar lohia aspataal main jaakar ankhen khol deen thi or doctoron ne use bachaa liya tha
 He remained in jail till 2001, after which he came out and escaped
 baad main use phir se giraftaar kiya tha
 He was in jail since then

 comguracarana dasah pracheen granth kii taaja vyakhyamahabharat ajmahakavy mahabharat ko aadhaar banaakar likhi gai pustak da difiklti ov biing good ke hindi anuwaad achchhai kii kathinaayee main us mahagranth main nihit duvidhaon, ghatnaon or charitron kii vartmaan ke sandarbh main vyakhya kii gai he
 The original author of the book is the former CEO of Procter & Gamble and a well-known signature of corporate world, Gurcharan Das, who through this book has made a meaningful effort to critically examine the circumstances of the Mahabharata period
 isamen unhone apane korporate jagat ke anubhavon ko bhi aadhaar banaaya he
 Translator Manohar Notani and his colleague Anil Singh have presented the spirit of the original book to a large extent, but in many places it becomes difficult to decide what the author wanted to say
 yadi is kamajori ko nazarandaaj kiya jaae to pustak main kai pathneey baaten hai
 But due to the translation, the book has become very annoying at some places
 is vajah se is pustak ko ek saath padhakar samajhnaa thodaa mushkil hoga
 But if all the chapters are read separately, it can be said to be a long and relative discussion on some parts of Mahabharata, which gives the readers a familiarity with the opportunistic ethics of today's world
 pustak main hindutv par bhi charchaa he or dharm ke arth par bahes bhi jo ki kaaphi sargarbhit he
 The basic message of the book is that the war of Mahabharata was meaningless and all-round and fought for personal malice and its characters were selfish, jealous, quill and subject to personal gain just like the people of today's society
 darasal lekhak yah sabit karnaa chahta he ki yuddh ek aisi vivashtaa he jisamen jeet kisi paksh kii nahin hoti par is adisatya ko jaanane / sunne ke baavjood yuddh hote aae hai, ho rahe hai
 In this respect, the book gives enough material to thinking
 lekhak ne pustak ke sheershak ke madhyam se yah bahes chalaane kaa prayaas kiya he ki achchhai ke maarg main kathinaaiyaan hai lekin iske baavjood achchhai hi shreyaskar he
 Deciding what is good is also very difficult
 dharm or karm ke antardvandv kaa bhi vishleshan he yahaan
 In the author's own words, "the epic theme of the epic presents a dramatic dilemma between moral purity and human karma
" ''is pustak ke madhyam se mahabharat ke alok main lekhak ne naitikta, niti or vyaavhaarikta main saamanjasy baitaane kii vakaalat kii he, jo ki aaj ke samay ke liye upyukt maarg he
 The book also makes a factual commentary on the global scenario with reference to the Mahabharata
 masalan, mandi or lehaman bros kaa paraabhav
 Currently, a lot can be learned, understood, corrected based on the events of Mahabharata
 pustak ke vishesh pathneey bhaag iske do aakhri adhyay 'nishkarsh' or 'dharm-katha ek shabd kii' hai, jisamen pustak kaa saar he
 While making a classical interpretation of religion, this author has given a very sobering commentary on many esoteric but basic subjects, which is the specialty of this book

 Enclosures are made for visitors in the famous Ramlila of Delhi
 lekin ab to ramlila cametiyon ke bich bhi raajnneetik baade ban gaye hai
 In a Ramlila committee, only BJP leaders go and then only Congress
 haa, bijepi netaaon kaa dilli main tota pad jaae to bhale aam aadmi party ke netaa aa jaae lekin congress kaa nahin hona chahie
 Because the pressure is not only of Ram Ravan's war policy but also of political pressure policy
 tabhi to dilli main hone vaali ram kii lila main raajnneeti kaa khelaa saaf dikhne lagata he
 If not the BJP leader or not even the Congress, this time Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will be the chief guest on the Ravan slaughter in Dussehra i
e
lovekusharamalila
 pradhanmantri, grih mantri yaa phir modi sarkaar ke kisi bade netaa ke na aane se khaali hui jagah bharne ke liye hoga
 After all, the empty space of a politician's absence has to be filled by a politician
 kyonki dabaav ye bhi rahata he ki agar bijepi ke netaa nahin aa paa rahe hai to kam se kam congress ke netaa samaaroh ke mukhya atithi kii kursi par nahin baithne chahie
 Irrespective of any other party
 kai netaaon or hastiyon ko jaataa he nyotalvakush ramlila cameti ke pradhan ashok agarwal kaa kahana he ki rajanetaaon kaa aana janaa to rahata he lekin ham kisi ke prabhaav yaa dabaav main nahin rahete
 By the way, we send invitations to all political parties, their leaders, ministers, chief ministers, ambassadors of countries and other celebrities
 ye to atithiyon par nirbhar hota he ki wo kab or kaise aa pate hai
 We have also invited Congress president and vice-president directly
 ab ajtak ke madhyam se bhi hamaari guzarish he ki wo dashahra samaaroh main jarur padhaaren
 The Ramlila committees have political leanings, but it is a matter of saying that the committees conducting the Kiramlila have their own political leanings
 vahiin raajnneetik dalon ke dabaav or prabhaav se bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Every political party and leader has a craze for Ramlila's stage
 har raajnneetik dal vahaan pahunch kar apni baat kahana chahta he
 There is also pressure on committees for this
 shri raghunandan lila samiti, dilli kaint ke pradhan deepak singhl iskaa samarthan karte hue kehete hai ki raajnneetik dabaav to hota he
 Every party and its leader, whether a councilor or MP, everyone wants only their supporters to climb the stage
 wo hi bhaashan den
 Do not even close the opponent
 ye badi chunauti hoti he ramlila aayojan cametiyon ke liye ki wo kaise sabake bich saamanjasy bithaaen
 MP and actor Manoj Tiwari says that i have also experienced politics
 ramlila cametiyon par raajnneetik dabaav uchit nahin he
 This is the leela of all our culture
 piem modi ko bulaane par hua vivadaramlila kii raajnneetik maar se to dilli kii puraani ramlilaon main se ek ramlila maidan kii shri ramlila cameti bhi nahin batch pai
 Since independence, only Congress leaders have been coming to the Dussehra festival till now
 party chaahe satta main rahi ho yaa satta se baahar
 Two years ago, when the talk of inviting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be the chief guest of the Dussehra festival arose, the committee's patron Jai Prakash Aggarwal was adamant that he would leave the committee if this happened
 is khinchataan main hua ye ki cameti ne nyotaa bheja or virodh main jepi agarwal ne cameti chhod di
 He joined the Navshri Ramlila Committee and the climax of this whole war was that PM Modi did not even come
 itnaa hone ke baavjood jepi maanate hai ki ramlilaon main raajnneetik taur par barebaaji yaa khemebaaji to nahin he
 Yes, Ramlila definitely has a craze among politicians
 lakhanu kii ramlila main jaaenge piem modinvashree dharmik lila cameti ke mukhya sangrakshak jepi agarwal kaa kahana he ki ramlila ke manch par raajnneeti nahin dharmik or saanskrithik baaten hi hoti he
 All the leaders want to go there to share their thoughts
 puraani dilli kii ek or badi ramlila shri dharmik ramlila cameti jisamen aazaadee ke baad se ab tak har saal raashtrapati aate rahe hai
 But Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of UPA Government came here every year during both tenures
 is baar bhi raashtrapati pranab mukherjee yahaan aa rahe hai lekin khabar to piem kaa na aana hi he
 PM will attend the Dussehra festival at Ramlila of Aishbagh in Lucknow, capital of UP state on Dussehra
 phir 2014 main piem modi pehali baar yahaan aae
 After this, in 2015, he was in America, then this time Lucknow
 piem kaa aana or na aana dilli main dashahara kii dhooma par asar to daalata hi he kyonki iske raajnneetik nihitarth bhi nikaale jate hai
 The indigenous company iball has launched 4G smartphone Andi 5Q Gold for Rs 6,799

 narendra modi sarkaar ne yah kehete hue upie sarkaar ke bhoomi adhigrahan bill main badlaav kiye ki ye lataki pariyojnaon ko aage badhaane ke liye zaruri he, haalanki hakeekat isse kaaphi alag he
 Despite repeated attempts by NDTV to get the list of these hanging projects from the government, we could not get it
 haalanki ek sheersh audyogic ikai ne kareeb ek hajaar karod rupayon kii ataki padi pariyojnaon kii ek list enditivi ko di he
 This shows that out of 67 mega projects, only seven, ie only 10% of the projects are such that land acquisition was in the way
 baaki 90 fisadi pariyojnaon ke fanse hone ke kaaran duusare hai
 At the same time, out of the seven projects which were stuck due to land acquisition, six are road projects
 hakikat main, sitambar 2013 ke vakt sirf 12 pariyojnaayen hi jameen ke masale par ataki hui thi
 Four of these (two road and two energy projects) projects saw little progress last year
 ye saare tathy beete saal bhoomi adhigrahan rukne ke sarkaar ke daawey par sawaal khadey karti he
 In this regard, we talked to BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao, he said, 'I don't know about any such list
 ' The government has not shared any data on stuck investment, but this list shows that the delay in this project was not the problem of land acquisition, but the real reason for the delay in getting approval from various government departments

 '' In Delhi, after the death of an accident due to a pit, many questions were raised about the pit on the road
 dilli or gudgaanv kii padtaal ke baad 'aaj tak' kii team ne gajiabad kaa rukh kiya
 Ghaziabad adjoining Delhi is counted among the big cities of UP, but the condition here looked worse than bad
 sadak par jagah-gagah gadadhegaziabad ke sabase pramukh chauraahey se nikali road jo nehru nagar, kavi nagar or tamaam duusare posh ilaakon ke andar jaati he us road par jagah-jagah bade-bade gadde hai, jab bhibarishhoti he to sadak puri tarah se talab ban jaati he
 But the problem is not so much that the street lights are bad in this entire road, so the problem doubles at night
 log hairaan is vajah se bhi he ki jile ke sabhi bade adhikari se lekar netaa tak sab isi sadak se guzarate hai lekin kisi ne abhi tak is sadak kii khabar nahin lee he
 The pond in Shastri Nagar of Pond area remains still a pond, whereas there has been no rain for the past two days
 jinka ghar is sadak par padataa he vah behad pareshaan hai
 Some people's shops are also on this road
 aise main vah kehete hai ki ab pani kii vajah sekstomrana kam ho gaye hai or unka dhandha chaupat hota ja rahaa he
 The road leading to NH24 is also bad for the sectors of Badhal and the main road outside
 enech 24 ko jodne vaali sadak par keechad pasra he
 Descending from the flyover are heapedes and mud slabs
 yah haal kuch ilaakon kaa nahin, balki puure gajiabad kaa hi he
 The corporation had passed a budget of 10 crores in April
 The Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation passed a budget of 10 crores in April to fill the pit built on the road

 Social activist Anna Hazare on Sunday reiterated the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government of the Center at Jantar Mantar on whether to bring the Jan Lokpal Bill or go till 2014
 anna hajaare ne aarope lagaaya ki desh se bhrashtachar mitaane ko lekar samprag sarkaar kii niyat saaf nahin he
 Therefore, she is not passing the Jan Lokpal Bill
 lekin unhone janata kaa aahvaan kiya ki yadi ve jaag jaaen to sarkaar ko yah vidheyak jaldi hi paarit karnaa hoga
 He said that his fight is for Lokshahi, in which power is in the hands of the people
 unhone gram sabhaaon ko bhi majboot karne par bal diya
 The comments chunaav main bhrasht va daagi ummidavaaron ko nakaarne kaa adhikaar matadaataaon ko dene kii vakaalat karte hue anna hajaare ne kaha ki sansad evam rajyon kii vidhansabhaon main badi sankhya main daagi log chunakar pahunch gaye hai
 If voters get the right to reject candidates, then it will be stopped
 anna ne kaha ki unki pehali ladaai janalokapal vidheyak ko lekar he
 Later the fight for the right to reject the candidates will be fought and then the voice of the farmers will be raised
 iske baad janpratinidhiyon ko waapas bulaane ke adhikaar ke liye bhi ladaai ladi jaaegi
 Anna Hazare alleged that the intention of the UPA government to eradicate corruption from the country is not clear
 isliye vah janalokapal vidheyak paarit nahin kar rahi
 But he called upon the public that if they wake up, the government will have to pass this bill soon
 unhone kaha ki unki ladaai lokshahi ke liye he, jisamen satta janata ke haathon main ho
 He also stressed on strengthening gram sabhas
 tippaniyan Advocating for giving voters the right to reject corrupt and tainted candidates in elections, Anna Hazare said that a large number of tainted people have reached the Parliament and state assemblies
 yadi ummidavaaron ko nakaarne kaa adhikaar matadaataaon ko mil jaae to is par roak lagegi
 Anna said that his first fight is with the Jan Lokpal Bill
 baad main ummidavaaron ko nakaarne ke adhikaar ke liye ladaai ladi jaaegi or phir kisaanon ke haq main aawaaj uthaai jaaegi
 After this, the fight for the right to recall the people's representatives will also be fought

 india main sabase zyada dekha jane vaala tivi sho 'main kuch bhi kar sakati hum' kaa teesraa sijan shuru hone ja rahaa he
 It is telecast on Doordarshan and Meenal Vaishnav is the lead actress
 mahilaon par hone vaale atyaacharon or samaaj main punap rahi kuritiyon ko sach kaa aaina dikhaanaa is sho kaa makasad he
 Meenal is playing the character of Dr
 Sneha Mathur in the show
 'main kuch bhi kar sakati hum' kii actress minal vaishnav or population foundation of india kii kaaryakari nideshkapunam mutreja se hamane khaas baatcheet kii
 During this, both spoke openly on every aspect of their lives
 saamaajikkureetiyaan or mitu capeinn ke alaava aane vaale projectus par bhi apni raay rakhi
 Ans- After giving me some auditions, 'I can do anything' in Dr
 sneha maathur kaa role mila
 At that time, i thought it would be the same as the rest of the television serials
 lekin jab 'main kuch bhi kar sakati hum' main kaam karne ke baad ham desh ke alag alag gaavon main shooting ke liye gaye or vahaan logon se mili, tab unki haalat dekhakar or unki kahaniyaan sunakar pataa chalaa kii is sho kaa unki zindagi par kya prabhaav pad rahaa he
 Then for the first time it felt as if i had done something good in life and someone's life was getting a little better because of me
 anjaane hi sahi par zindagi ne mujhe kisi ek badi muhim kaa hissaa bana diya he
 Ans- There are many such situations in the life of every human being, which he thinks and feels bad
 mere jivan main bhi aisa samay aayaa jab main 18 saal kii thi or mere parivaaravale meri shaadi kar dena chaahate the, par main agepad likhakar kaam karnaa chaahati thi
 After fighting many battles to fulfill their dreams, the family finally had to kneel in front of my stubbornness
 main maanati hum kii apane parivaar waalon ko dukh pahunchaana galat hota he, lekin jab aap sahi ho tab aapako kisi ke bare main nahin sochna chahie
 When we do the right thing, then everyone realizes what is right and what is wrong
 Ans- vartmaan samay main is samaaj kii kuritiyon se ladane ke liye mahilaon ko sabase pehle yah samajhnaa hoga kii ve khud duusari mahilaon kii dushman na bane
 We should think that no one else has passed through the pain we have gone through
 ham mahilaon ko apni kaabiliyat par bharosa hona chahie – yah vishwaas hona chahie ki 'main kuch bhi kar sakati hum' – main apni zindagi sudhaar sakati hum, apane gaanv kii sthiti sudhaar sakti hum – main desh ko badal sakati hum
 The day we understand that we have our own qualities that make us different from everyone else, we will start loving others and ourselves which is very important
 isse ham apanesaath hi nahin balki dusron ke saath bhi kabhi galat nahin hone denge
 In this way, wrongness will stop in the world
 Ans- # metoo se yah phayda he kii na sirf film industry main balki chote shaharon main bhi ab logo apni kisi sahakarmi ko galat massej karne se pehle shaayad das baar sochenge
 i think it is a very good thing that women, children and men will get a chance to live and work in a very safe and comfortable environment
 Ans- ham 'main kuch bhi kar sakati hum' kaa teesraa sijan shoot kar rahe he or bahut hi jald yah dharawahik tivi par hoga
 i could not find any other show like this or i could not find one which would have a positive effect on someone's life
 main sirf sasta manoranjan nahin karnaa chaahati hoon
 Along with entertainment, i also want to give inspiration to improve life
 jis din isi tarah kii koi film yaa serial main kaam karne kaa mujhe mauka milegaa, main zarur karongi
 Ans- i support # metoo
 mujhe lagata he kii surakshit vaataavaran main jeena or kaam karnaa har insaan kaa haq he
 So i support # metoo
 mere saath kabhi aisi koi ghatana nahin hui
 Ans- Many components have contributed to this venture
 lekin main 3 sabase mahatvapurn ghatakon par raushnee daalana chaahuungi--sabase pehle main creative diarector firoz abbaj khan or puri production team ko puraa shrey dena chaahuungi
 Created by him, this program is a great series of messages on various topics with entertainment, including topics such as family planning, gender selection, which are not usually discussed openly and in order to bring about a change in behavior
 Education has also been included along with it
 -is kaarykram kii safalataa kaa doosraa kaaran he- is shrinkhalaa main manoranjan va shiksha par duniya ke paryaapt saboot he jisase saamaajik maandand or swasthya sambandhi vyavhaar badalane main safalataa mili he
 And we are very fortunate to have got the guidance of Professor Arvind Singhal, a renowned global expert on entertainment and education
 - main firoz ji or unki team ko iskaa puraa shrey dena chaahati hoon kyonki unhone jagah jagah jaakar is kaarykram ke liye vividh samasyaon or unke halon par research kiya he
 Due to this research, the characters and stories of this program seem true to this extent
 Ans- ‘main kuch bhi kar sakati hum' manoranjan par dhyaan dete hue, vaastavik jivan or saamaajik gatishiltaa par research karata he
 Even if the narrative is fictitious, the solutions we show in the series are real
 aise logon kii kahaniyon par aadhaarit hote hai, jinhone apane jivan main badlaav kiye hai yaa pitrusatta, bhedbhaav or purvagrahon kaa saamana karte hue adwitiya samaadhaan die hai
 This gives the series a sense of real life and reality
 sijan 3 main, ham bharat kii yuva aabaadi tak pahunchnaa chaahate hai
 Therefore, we have a big focus on digital media with television dramas
 vishwa str par apni tarah ke pehle artificial intelligence sanchalit chatbot par dow sneha digital avatar main dikhaai dengi
 She will answer questions and share information with the audience
 ab ham digital spes par bhi sandesh kaa vistaar kar rahe hai
 The story is more entertaining than ever and Dr
 Sneha's journey continues to change the face of the country (or to change the face of the country like this slogan)
 Ans- kaarykram kaa uddeshy mahila adhikaron, yon or prajnan swasthya ko prabhavit karne vaale muddon, in par saamaajik mandandon, drushtikonon or prathaon ko bataanaa or samaadhaan dena he
 i consider the stories of the real heroes of Change, the real heroes of the success of our program
 madhya pradesh ke chhatarpur jile ke nayagaav gaanv kii ek ladki apane mata-pita ko college bhejne or skool ke baad shaadi nahin karne ke liye manaa kar saki, bihar kii ek yuva mahila apane samudaay main jaldi-jaldi baccha paidaa karne se manaa kar ke champion ban gai he, madhyapradesh ke ek gaanv ke ek purush patni ko maarane kii jagah parivaar niyojan main purush bhagidaari ke champion ban gaye
 Many more such stories reinforce our belief that the program builds a deeper connection with those who are underserved and who need powerful stories to become change agents
