 pulavama hamale ke baad india today se khaas baatcheet main pakistan ke purv raashtrapati or sena pramukh parvej musharraf ne kaha ki yah kaaphi dukhad he
 On Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reply to the statement, Musharraf said that if Modi does this then it will be the biggest mistake of his life
 agar aap sochate hai ki pakistan par hamalaa karenge or pakistan chup baithegaa to aap galat soch rahe hai
 The former Pakistani army chief told India Today Group news director Rahul Kanwal and executive editor Anjana Om Kashyap that our army is not weak and you will have to bear the consequences
 unhone kaha ki aapke pradhanmantri ke dil main koi aag nahin lagi hui, usase kahin zyada aag mere dil main tab lagati he jab hajaaron kashmiri maare jate hai

 Musharraf said that Jaish kingpin Maulana Masood Azhar had also tried to kill me
 unhone kaha ki mere dil main jaish ke liye koi santvanaa nahin he
 Musharraf said that Maulana Azhar may have carried out the Pulwama attack, but Pakistan government is involved in this, it cannot be said
 isamen antar he, meraa maananaa he ki pakistan sarkaar isamen shaamil nahin he
 The Government of India should provide evidence of the attack after the investigation, after which the Government of Pakistan has to take a decision about the action
 agar pakistan sarkaar isamen shaamil he to yah behad sharmnaak he
 Masood Azhar, who has campaigned for Imran Khan's party, is roaming freely in Pakistan
 parvej musharraf ne kaha ki imran kii party ke liye prachaar karnaa alag baat he lekin isse yah sabit nahin hota ki dardanaak hamale ke peeche imran khan kaa haath he
 He said that Jaish and Lashkar have been working in Pakistan since 1991, so it is too early to say that the Pakistan government is behind the attack
 pakistan main jaish kii maujuudagi or phalne-phoolne ke bare main musharraf ne kaha ki jaish kya-kya nayaa kara rahaa he, iske bare main nahin bataa saktaa lekin agar unhone pakistan ke andar bhi aatanki hamale karaae hon to unhen choda nahin janaa chahie

 Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh are due later this year, but the Congress is worried about the fund
 madhya pradesh kii satta se congress kareeb 15 saal se baahar he
 In 2014, the Congress has also been out of power at the Center
 yaheen nahin pichley kuch daur main congress ko kai rajyon main bhi chunaav ke baad satta se bedakhal hona padaa he
 If seen, in big states Karnataka and Punjab only have Congress government
 karnataka main agle do-teen maheene main hi vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 In the situation which is more or less, raising funds for the Congress is not less than Kheer
 party kii kendriya kaman ne bhi rajya vidhansabha chunaavon main simit fund dene ke liye hi hami bhari he
 In such a situation, the responsibility of raising funds has come on the shoulders of the Madhya Pradesh unit of Congress in the assembly elections
 pradesh congress ne iske liye kavayad bhi shuru kar di he
 In this way, he has prepared various types of proposals
 inamen sabase dilachasp prastaav he- tikat kii aas rakhane waalon se chandaa lenaa
 The proposal has also been discussed between the state Congress and general secretary in-charge Deepak Bavaria
 is babat puche jane par pradesh congress adhyaksh arun yadav ne ajtak ko bataaya, “haa, tikataarthiyon se chanda lene kaa prastaav he, jis par abhi charchaa ho rahi he
 The proposal is that, whoever wishes to become a Congress candidate on the 230 assembly seats of the state, will have to fill a candidature form and also have to deposit 50 thousand rupees as money
 party ko lagata he ki, rajya ke aaj ke halaat main ek seat par kai-kai ummidavaarchunavladana chaahate hai, aise main chunaav ladane ke liye party fund main thik thaak paisa ikattha ho jayega
 At the same time, a section of the party also believes that, by this, those seeking unnecessary tickets will automatically get rid of themselves and the unnecessary headache in ticket sharing will also be reduced
 haalanki, jab ye prastaav rajya ke netaaon ke saamne rakhaa gaya to ye sawaal bhi uthaa ki madhya pradesh main kai garib ilaake hai
 In such a situation, from where will the candidates get the money and this will force many good candidates to pull their hands from contesting elections
 saath hetikatato ek seat se ek ko hi milegaa, baakiyon ke paise to waapas milenge nahin
 Despite this question, the party feels that in today's era, seriously wanting to contest the assembly elections can donate 50 thousand rupees to the party fund
 party netaa maanate hai ki bijepi chunaav prachaar main anaap shanaap paisa kharch karti ai he or madhya pradesh main bhi karegi
 In such a situation, the party needs funds to fight the election, otherwise it will be more harmful if the party is backward due to lack of publicity

 Now Twitter is going to be a riot for sure— Genelia Deshmukh (@geneliad)april 17, 2015 Is it a crime for us to be a Dalit? ”says Ramprakash (name changed) of Bhagana village in Hisar in Haryana
 unki yah tis bevajaah nahin he
 His 17-year-old Ladli was gang-raped on March 23 after allegedly being kidnapped by five Jat boys, four of whom were from the village
 insaaf kii aas main gaanv ke kareeb 90 dalit parivaar dilli ke jantar-mantar par dharna de rahe hai
 On the other hand, there is a fear of anything unexpected happening in the eyes of the Dalit families of Bhagana
 ramprakash kehete hai, ‘‘janvari, 2014 main gaanv ke sarpanch rakesh kumaar panghal ne mujhe peeta or bura anjaam bhugatne kii dhamkee bhi di thi
 "they used to work in Rakesh's fields only
 ve panghal par bhi is ghatana kii sajeesh rachane kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 Bhagana village made headlines in 2012 when there was a dispute over community land
 jaaton ne daliton kaa saamaajik bahishkaar kar diya tha
 Hence, 136 Dalit families sat on a dharna in front of Hisar's mini secretariat and marched on foot to Delhi
 hisar ke mini sachivalay par kuch dalit parivaar aaj bhi apni dincharya kii chizon ke saath deraa jamaaye hue hai
 Satish Kajal, 32, of Bhagana, who is sitting on a dharna there, says, "neither the administration nor the government has heard us so far
 ’’ duusari ore, prashasan kaa najariya ekadam alag he
 Hisar SP Shivas Kaviraj says, "the case is being politicized and exaggerated
" gaanv main lagaataar police gasht hoti he
 “the Dalit adolescent girls who were raped are from a Dalit community called Dhanak who did not leave the village in 2012
 ek peedita kii maa kahati hai, ‘‘pehle bhi hamen aise hi suraksha kii guarantee di gai thi, lekin hua kya? nattejey aapke saamne hai
 When asked about the recent gang rape incident, Kaviraj says, "we arrested the five accused
" sarpanch or ek anya ke khilaaf aaropon kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 '' Hisar Deputy Commissioner M
 el
 Kaushik has a similar attitude
 police ne ek naaballig or ek balig ladki ke saath rape kii pushti kii he
 Ironically, there is no improvement in the condition of Dalits despite the allegation of giving political cause to the matter
 isaki vajah yah he ki yahaan jat bahusankhyak hai
 Due to political clout, officers also appear in their favor
 hisar main daliton kii aabaadi kareeb 22 fisadi he jo rajya ke ausat 19 fisadi ke mukaable zyada he
 At the same time, their population in Bhagana is 27 percent while the Jats make up about 60 percent of the population
 aakhir kya vajah he ki daliton kii koi sunwaayee nahin ho rahi? daliton ke utpeeda ke khilaaf kai andolanon ke agua rahe sarv samaaj sangharsh samiti ke adhyaksh vedapal singh tanvar kehete hai, ‘‘darasal haryana kii raajnneeti main jaaton kaa hi varchasv he
 Political parties do not want to risk offending the Jats
 ’’ haal main dekha gaya he ki dalit rajnatik rup se bhi ekajute hone kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Perhaps this is the reason that there has been a lot of anger towards them here
 bhagana gaanv main yah talkhi dikhti he
 India Today held talks with a dozen Jats and blamed all the victims
 unamem daliton ke pradarshan ko lekar bhi naaraazgi he
 On the allegations leveled against him, the village sarpanch Panghal says, "let the accusation happen, what happens to the accusation?" On the accusation of the victim's father, he says, "yes, because of negligence in work, i gave him -three had clashed
 lekin baad main sulah ho gai thi
 "poonam (name changed) of Dabra, who was a victim of gang rape in 2012," says, "it is being used as a rape weapon to humiliate Dalits
" ’’jantar-mantar par baithe peedit waapas gaanv nahin janaa chaahate
 The delegation of the victims have also appealed to the Home Minister, but they did not get anything other than the assurance
 naaballig peedita kii maa kahati hai, ‘‘aakhir, ham daliton-garibon kii sunata koun he?’’ In Mumbai, a 16-year-old girl fell off both her arms, but the railway administration is refraining from taking responsibility

 Monica More, who has been admitted to a hospital for four days, has now changed her life
 pichley shanivaar ko vah ghatkoper stesan par train pakadte vakt platform par gir gai or uske donon haath train ke neeche aakar cat gaye
 Her entire family is in shock along with Monica
 railway prashasan ne kaha he ki monica train pakadaney ke liye daud rahi thi
 If she did not run, the accident would not have happened
 aise main railway kaa koi kasoor nahin he, to muaavje kii baat bhi nahin banati
 CCTV footage shows Monica trying to board the train when she was very crowded
 train jab chalane lagi to usne usee dibbe ke aage ke daravaaje se chadhane kii koshish kii
 The subsequent footage could not be captured on camera
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki platform ke paas signal or trek kaa kaam shuru kiya gaya lekin use adhuraa hi chhod diya gaya
 But the incomplete platform had no board to provide information
 aise main prashasan par sawaal uthaae ja rahe hai
 BJP leader Kirit Somaiya said in this case that Monica should get justice and the railway officials should be punished because the work on the platform was incomplete
 monica ke pita ashok more or uski skool teacher vidya bhi sadame main hai
 He says that Monica must get justice

 input: IANS Sheetla Ashtami is worshiped on the eighth day of Holi
 sheetala saptami yaa ashtami kaa vrath caitra maheene ke krishna paksh kii saptami or ashtami tithi ko kiya jaataa he
 This year, this fast is being observed on 27 and 28 March
 is din log sheetala mata kaa vrath rakhkar unki puja karte hai
 After worshiping, the devotees offer cold stale offerings to the mother Sheetla
 aaie jaanate hai aakhir mata sheetala ko unke bhakt basi prasad kaa bhoga kyon lagaate hai
 According to Hinduism, while opening every fast, it is a rule to offer pure fresh offerings made to God
 lekin ye niyam mata sheetala ke vrath main lagu nahin hota he
 On this day people do not cook fresh food in their homes
 is din thanda bhojan khaae jane kaa rivaaj he
 Religious reason behind the offering of stale offerings on the eighth day of the evening, it is said that cold food is very dear to Mother Sheetla
 dharmik manyata ke anusaar mata sheetala ke naam kaa matlab he thanda
 This is the reason why people offer cold things to them to please Shitala Devi
 uttar bharat main sheetala saptami yaa ashtami ke vrath ko basauda naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 This is also because after this day people stop consuming stale food
 aisa mana jaataa he ki ye din is ritu kaa antim din hota he jab vyakti basi khaanaa kha saktaa he
 Fasting of Shitala Devi is believed to please Shitala Devi
 jisaki vajah se fode, netron ke samast rog or sheetala se hone vaale dosha dur ho jate hai
 Sheetla Mata protects children's health
 saath hi dhan daulat kaa ambara bhar detii hai
 Sheetla is like Mother Goddess, riding on a donkey
 unke haath main jhaadu hoti he
 Neem leaves are worn like jewels
 unke ek haath main sheethal yani thande jal kaa kalash bhi hota he
 Mata is the symbol of cleanliness, healthy life and coolness
 sheetala ashtami main sheetala mata kii aise puja karen-- is din se thande pani se snaan shuru hota he, kyonki surya ek dam sidhe upar aa jane se garmi bad jaati he
 - Take Ganga water and take bath on this day
 naarangi vastra pahanen
 - Go to Shitala temple at 12 noon and worship mother
 - mata ko sugandhit phool, neem ke patton or sugandhit itr daalkar puja karen
 - Serve cold or stale food to Sheetla Mata
 - kapur jalaakar aarti karen
 - ॐ Chant Shitla Matrai Namah Mantra
 basi khaane kaa mahatv-- sheetala ashtami ke din ghar main thanda or basi khaanaa khaaya jaataa he
 On this day in the morning, the stove is not lit in the house
 is din thodaa neem kii pattiyaan bhi khaani chahie
 - On this day cold stale puas, puris, pulses, rice and sweets are eaten by offering it to the mother
 - khaane se pehle bhojan daan bhi karnaa chahie

 bharat sarkaar ne 10 central agenciyon ko desh ke sabhi computers ko monitor or intercept karne kii kshamta di he
 Now these agencies can monitor not only email but also all types of data kept in your computer
 teen mukhya bate hai – intercept, monitor or dicript
 This is not surprising though, as it was seen earlier when the Congress was in government
 tab central monitering system naam kii vyavstha thi jo ab bhi ek rahasy kii tarah hi he
 Intercept means that any probe agency can intercept the data reaching your computer to find out what is happening
 chaahe baatcheet video kol kii shakl main ho yaa email kii tarah
 Monitoring means that the agency can access you and monitor it
 lagaataar najar banaae rakhegi ki aap apane computer par kya kar rahe handicripshan yani agar aapkaa communication sicyor he yaa phir aapane apane data ko kisi tarah se sicyor karke rakhaa he to agency ise ancript karke isamen sa sari jaankariyaan ikaithi kar sakati he
 Wherever you buy internet, that internet service provider can give your information to your usage history government agency
 ye is aadesh main kaha gaya he
 The government has cited National Security behind this
 2008 mumbai atake ke baad UPA sarkaar ne isaki neenv rakhi!america agency enese kii nigaraanee project PRISM kii tarah hi bharat main bhi aisi hi nigaraanee ke liye project banane kii taiyaari shuru hui
 Named Central Monitoring System
 is project ko lophul intercepshan ke liye plan kiya gaya jiske tahat phone or internet ko intercept kiya ja saktaa tha
 For this, the help of c-dot and other government agency was taken
 tahalaka magazine kii ek report ke mutabik si dot or state telecommunication R&D centre ne 2011-12 main dilli main central monitering system ke payalat project par kaam karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 According to Seedot's Result Framework Document, lab testing of CMS was done in 2009-10 itself
 disambar 2012 main tab ke mos communication or iti milind devda ne loksabhaa main kaha tha, ‘is system kaa development work mote taur par puraa ho chukaa he
 The pilot project was completed on 30 September 2011 in Delhi where c-dot installed two ISF servers' The UPA government had prepared the scheme to secure internet space after the 2008 Mumbai attack
 baad me sarkaar intercept or monitor karne ke apane edia ke saath november 2009 main rajyasabha main kaha, ‘sarkaar desh main mobile phones, landline or internet communication ko monitor karne ke liye centralined system propose karti he
 The CMS will be implemented by the dot so that the security remains' tell you that the entire project was on the lines of PRISM which the US officially announced to close after Snowden's revelations
 prism project main bhi america sahit kuch duusare deshon ke citijan kii nigaraanee kii jaati thi
 Does such a project benefit from spying on citizens? There are many questions on this

 ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan kii maang ko lekar hafton tak aamaran anshan karne vaale tapasvi chhavnee ke mahant paramhans das ne 6 disambar ko aatmadah karne kaa elaan kisa he
 Paramagnas Das said on Friday that the Yogi government and the Modi government had cheated him and broken his fast
 lihaaja mandir nahin banane par ab unke paas aatmadah ke alaava koi rasta nahin he
 Paramahamsa Das made a wooden pyre at the main gate of the Baikeda temple and worshiped it himself
 iske baad chita ke bich main khadey hokar unhone centre kii modi sarkaar or uttar pradesh kii yogi sarkaar ko jamkar khari-khoti sunai
 According to Paramahansa Das, when he sat on a fast unto death demanding the construction of the temple, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath broke the fast and assured him that he would meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and make every effort to build the temple
 paramhans das ne kaha ki unhone yogi par bharosa kar galati kii, kyonki naa to abhi tak mahant ko yogi adityanath ne pradhanmantri narendra modi se milwaaya or naa hi mandir nirmaan ke liye koi pahal kii
 Paramahansa Das says that just as Professor GD Agarwal gave up his life for the cleanliness of the Ganges, similarly he will give up his life for the construction of the temple
 sant das ke mutabik shaayad iske baad hi sarkaar kii ankhen khulegi or mandir nirmaan kaa rasta saaf hoga
 Regarding the Dharma Sabha of Shiv Sena and Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Paramhans said that this is all a political event
 isliye ve inase kisi bhi tareeke kaa koi vaasta nahin rakhenge
 Mahant Paramahansa Das said that such manipulations are adopted by political parties just before the election and no one takes meaningful initiative to build the temple
 sant paramhans kii is chetavanee ke baad shashan prashasan kii najar un par bani hui he, lekin abhi tak sarkaar kii taraf se baat karne kii koi pahal nahin kii gai he
 The Samajwadi Party (SP) has got just five seats in the Lok Sabha elections
 pichley chunaav main bhi sapa ko paanch siten mili thim
 In the last election, the SP contested alone
 is baar uskaa do dalon -bahujan samaaj party (basapa), rashtriya lokdal (ralod)- ke saath gathbandhan tha
 This alliance was considered invincible
 lekin dhak ke vahi teen paat
 Even though the BSP benefited in the alliance
 usne 10 siten jeet leen, lekin baaki do dal jahaan ke tahaan rah gaye
 Three members of the Mulayam family lost the election
 ralod apane hisse kii teenon siten haar gaya
 In this election, SP President Akhilesh Yadav and party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav managed to win from Azamgarh and Mainpuri respectively
 magar unke parivaar ke teen anya sadasyon ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Akhilesh's wife Dimple Yadav was defeated by BJP candidate Subrata Pathak by 12,353 votes in the Kannauj seat
 iske alaava firozabad seat se akhilesh ke chachere bhai akshay yadav or badaayun seat se ek anya chachere bhai dharmendra yadav ko apni-apni seat ganvaani padi
 Mulayam Singh Yadav's margin of victory in Mainpuri was only one-fourth of that of 2014
 mulaayam singh yadav ne chunaav se pehle hi mayawati ke saath gathbandhan ke akhilesh ke faisle par naaraazgi jaahir kii thi
 On giving 38 seats to Mayawati, she said that half the seats were already lost
 lekin akhilesh ne khule taur par kaha tha ki yadi unhen do kadam peeche bhi hatana padegaa to bhi vah gathbandhan karenge, kyonki gorkhupar, phulpur or kairana siton ke liye hue upachunaav main unhone gathbandhan kaa meetha swaad chakh liya tha
 However, one aspect of this is that if the alliance had not happened, the SP might not have got even five seats this time
 zyada sambhav tha ki mulaayam or akhilesh bhi chunaav haar jate
 In this context, Akhilesh's decision can be considered correct
 lekin yahaan to sawaal is baat kaa he ki basapa is chunaav main shunya se 10 siton par pahunch gai, magar sapa ko gathbandhan kaa vah laabh kyon nahin mila, jo basapa ko mila
 There are two answers to this question
 ek to sapa kaa paariwarik kalah iskaa ek kaaran he

 The Congress feels that the PM of Japan going directly to Gujarat, doing a road show there, then laying the foundation stone in Ahmedabad is a political move of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 iske jariye modi do maheene baad hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ko jeetna chaahate hai
 The first Congress spokesperson, Manish Tiwari, said that the PM of Japan should have come to Delhi, the capital of the country
 iske baad guuruuvaar ko bullate train ke shilanyas se pehle hi congress ne meeting karke tay kar liya ki congress japan ke piem kii yatra kaa sammaan karegi, lekin modi par hamalaa bolegi
 The same thing happened as well, there was a foundation stone in Ahmedabad, here in the Congress headquarters in Delhi, Congress leader in Lok Sabha and former Railway Minister Mallikarjun Kharge, former Minister of State for Home RPN Singh met the media
 japan ke piem kii yatra or bullate train yojana kaa swaagat kiya or phir modi par tabadatod hamale kar die
 Putting a series of questions, stole 10 questions from PM Modi and BJP
 1
 The Manmohan government had signed an agreement with Japan in 2013 for the high-speed train
 yah bhi upie kaa hi project he
 So why is this project starting after 3 and a half years? Just because Gujarat has assembly elections? 2
 yahaan 12 stesan banaaye gaye hai, jabaki 1 yaa 2 stesan hi hote hai bullate train main
 It is estimated that its speed will be less than the capital
 ye sirf chunavi phaayde ke liye nahin he kya?3
 The work of bringing high speed trains has been going on since 2005
 kai rooton par yah train chalaane kii yojana pehle se he
 Today, there is a campaign in the name of Modi Bullet Train
 mumbai jo kii aarthik rajdhani he uski bajaae ahmedabad main shilanyas kiya gaya
 Just because there is an election? 4
 ye project aarthik rup se vyavhaarik nahin he kyonki hawaii jahaaj kaa kiraaya 2 hajaar se shuru hota he
 If 1 lakh people travel daily in a bullet train, then only profit will be made, otherwise there will be loss
 5
 Who will sit poor in this? Who will sit poor by paying Rs 2800? 6
 har chiz kaa target 2020 yaa 22 kaa rakhte hai, 2019 kii baat kyon nahin karte? kya isliye taaki aglaa chunaav bhi jeet jaaen?7
 Varanasi was also making Kyoto what happened by bringing Shinzo? Now we will make bullet trains
 modi bhaashan dekar kyon bhul jate hai?8
 Say that 0
 1 percent byaaj par rin diya
 No country offers anything for free
 sab to vahi banaayegaa, usame kitna kamishan jaayegaa kisko pataa? gumraah kar logon ko kyon bevakoof bana rahe hai?9
 Why the bullet train is being stopped at stations where the capital does not stop
 bullate train ke liye infrastracchar kii taiyaari maujuuda daur main paryaapt he kya? abhi to zamin kaa adhigrahan tak nahin hua?10
 The government is not focused on general rail, there have been 19 accidents in a year
 praathamikta railway main sefti kii honi chahie na ki bullate train kii
 Why is the government not providing the money required for railway safety? Why are 3 lakh vacancies not yet filled in the railway? The Congress did not forget to remind that Shinzo Abe was given the highest civilian honor of Japan in August 2014 by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 aise main congress ke samay se hi bharat ke japan se behatar rishte rahe hai

 There was a time when handwoven sweaters were considered the best thing to gift someone during the winter

 Institutions were open to train women and girls to wear sweaters from village to cities
 par aaj haath se bune hue sweateron kaa chalan kaaphi kam ho gaya he
 On cold days people now prefer to wear readymade sweaters or jackets
 ab kam hi mahilaayein oon kharidkar sweater bunati dekhi jaati hai
 It may be attributed to lack of time or the lack of interest in weaving women's sweaters, but nowadays, whether children or old, all are preferring readymade sweaters

 log in maharashtra main sarkaar banane ko lekar halchal tejasanjay nirupam ne kiya shivasena ke saath kaa virolltvit kar kaha isse congress ko nuksaan hogamaharashtra main congress-shivasena or ensipi vaali sarkaar banati dikh rahi he
 But some of his leaders are not happy with the Congress going with the Shiv Sena keeping ideology out
 congress netaa sanjay nirupam ne ek baar phir twit kar congress par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 He said that till when will these three spoiled government run
 shuukravaar ko sanjay nirupam ne twit kiya ki hamaare netaaon kaa tark he ki bijepi ko rokane ke liye ham shivasena se haath mila rahe hai
 But how long will a government with three spoilers last? donon haal main bijepi ko hi phayda hoga or nuksaan congress kaa hoga
 Our leaders argue that we are taking the risk of joining hands with the Shiv Sena to stop the BJP
 magar ‘teen tigaade kaam bigaade’vaali sarkaar chalegi kab tak?phir yaa to bijepi kisi ke saath sarkaar banaaegi yaa chunaav honge
 In both cases, BJP will benefit
 or nuksaan hoga congress kaa
 - Sanjay Nirupam (@sanjaynirupam) November 22, 2019 Let us tell you that earlier on Thursday also, Sanjay Nirupam had targeted the Congress for going with Shiv Sena
 sanjay nirupam ne likhaa tha ki maharashtra main bhi congress uttar pradesh jaisi galati kar rahi he
 He wrote in the tweet, 'the Congress had made a mistake by aligning with BSP in Uttar Pradesh years ago, then such a pitcher could not get up till date
 maharashtra main bhi congress vahi galati kar rahi he, shivasena kii sarkaar main tisare number kii party bananaa congress ko dafan karne jaisaa he
 It would be better if the Congress president does not come under pressure
 ’abaki baar uddhav sarkaar?aapako bataa den ki shuukravaar ko congress-ensipi or shivasena ke bich final baithak hogi
 In this meeting, there will be a final talk about the sharing of ministries
 guuruuvaar ko sharad pavaar or uddhav thakare ke bich hui baithak main pavaar ne mukhyamantri pad ke liye uddhav ke naam ko aage kiya
 Aditya Thackeray and Sanjay Raut also agreed on this
 rajdhani main baadh kaa khatra mandaraane laga he kyonki yamuna khatre ke nishaan se upar bah rahi he
 According to flood control officials, the water level in Yamuna at present is 204
 55 meter tak pahunch gaya he jabaki khatre kaa nishaan 204 meter haisarkaar ne chetavanee jari kar diyani yamuna khatre ke nishaan se philhal aadha meter upar bah rahi he
 In view of this, the government has issued an order to vacate the areas along the banks of Yamuna
 dilli main aise halaat barish kii vajah se paidaa nahin hue he
 Due to the huge amount of water released from the freshwater dam of Haryana, there has been a risk of flooding in the capital
 guruuvar ko haryana ne yamuna main chaar lakh 20 hajaar kusik pani choda tha
 Girijakumar Mathur's world of poems and songs is a world of rare linguistic fragrances, which sets him apart from his contemporaries
 ek vakt 'chaaya mat choona man hoga dukh duuna man' tathaa 'mere yuva aam main nayaa bor aayaa he / khushboo bahut he kyonki tumne lagaaya he'
 
 
 As such, the lyrics were very popular among poetry
 unhen sahitya academy, vyas sammaan va shalaka aadi kai sammaanon se nawaja gaya
 Mathur, who held the post of Deputy Director General in Doordarshan, was recognized due to the flow of scientificism and ideology in his poems, and the present, who was an alumnus and witness, was considered as the greatest creation of his time
 aaj girijakumar maathur kii sauveen jayanti par unke avdaan ko sahitya ajtak par yaad kar rahe hai hindi ke suparichit aalochak dow om nishchalajanmashti: girijakumar maathur (22 agast 1919- 10 janvari 1994) malwa kaa kavi-manjo kavita ke galiyare se kabhi gujarey honge unke kaanon main kabhi kuch geet panktiyaan sun padi hongi
 'don't touch the shadow, mind will hurt
 ' udaasiyon se bhari samvednaa kaa yah geet kavi kii nij abhivyakti hone ke baavjood us daur main har udhaas vyakti kaa geet ban gaya tha
 Similarly, a song sung at every festive festival: 'hum Hone Kamal Ek Din', or the song written immediately after Independence: 'aaj jeet ki jaat pahruhe be careful' These songs are from Girija Kumar Mathur who belonged to Malwa
 malwa ke kaviyon or lekhakon kii alag hi chhavi hindi main dikhti he
 On the one hand, poets of Vedic image like Naresh Mehta, on the other hand journalists writing ravishing prose like Rajendra Mathur, Prabhash Joshi, Pandit Pravar critics like Prabhakar Shrotriya, in whose prose poetry takes the vibrations
 malwa ko ham gandhi chintan ke prakhar kavi or geet farosh va satapura ke jangal jaisi mohak kavitaayen likhane vaale bhavaniprasad mishra se bhi pahachaanate hai
 This is the birth centenary year of the poet Girijakumar Mathur of Malwa soaked with such literature and culture
 girijakumar maathur ke pita devicharan maathur sushikshit tathaa vaidic wand
 Was the master of Muay
 vivekanand ke chintan se prabhavit pita khud kavyasanskaron ke vyakti the
 His poetry, a collection of poems of Savaiyas and couplets etc
 was also published under the name Gyan Gyan
 isse sahaj hi us vaataavaran evam parivesh kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he, jisamen girijakumar maathur janame, paley-bade or saahitiyik sanskaron ke bich hone kaa saubhaahgya hasil kiya
 It would be said to be the specialty of the family that the magazine Saraswati, which came out in 1901, used to come to his house regularly
 pita ne inhen hitopadesh ke shloke ratwaaye the tathaa bachapan main meley thele main milane vaali mitti kii gadiyon se khelte hue uski aakarshak khadkhad yaa gadagad dhwani se ek khaas aakarshan unke bheetar panpa va lay ke prati ek vishesh khinchaav paidaa hua
 From there the rhyme started to be made which helped in the creation of a great poet
 balak girijakumar bahanon ke dulaare rahe tathaa bachapan ke khel main bahanon ke saath bahut anand aata
 The dark environment in which he was born, even though in his words, was a foggy world of the nineteenth century, where the bells of cows, the chirping of birds, the shrieks of shrill from the temple in the twilight of the temple were heard with the sound of the shrill kirtan
 Echoes 
 
 yah sab milakar ek aise lok parivesh ko upasthit karte the, jisamen unka man rama rahata tha, yaheen kahin man ke avchetan main lok or lok dhvaniyon kaa prabhaav dhire-dhire padataa gaya hoga, jo aage chal kar unke geeton or kavitaaon ke saundaryabodh main parilakshith hua
 Identification of nature by nature is also very dense in the sense of identification of the poet, behind which he has his own observations
 bachapan main malwa ke parivesh main beete din bhulaae nahin bhoolatey
 Entering it in his memory, he wrote: "there are red plateaus extending for miles and with this the dark fields of black soil begin
 imali, simal, neem, khajuron ke jhuramut, palash, khirani, jamun, aam, mahuve, chirunchi or tad ke vrikshon se chaaya hua yah pradesh he jahaan ke dhuhon, toriyon, tilon ke ghumaavdaar kataavon ke bich se chattani nadiyaan bahati hai
 These wild rainy streams and small blossoms, flowing between the palm clumps, are the same unseen rivers that flow from south to north and join the Jamuna
 '' kahana na hoga ki jaise satapura ke jangal bhavani prasad mishra ke kavy main ramya nerrative ban kar saamne aate hai, vaise hi betwa or sindhu nadi ke saahchary kii sakshi malwa kii is vindhyas bhoomi par kavi ne do kavitaayen likhi hai- dhakvani or diyadhri, jiske nerrative main ek khaas kism kaa aakarshan he
 Tau ji Patwari and Kanungo were at home
 maamaaon kii ginati bade vakeelon main hoti
 Mama was also fond of music, so the boy Girija learned rhythm from his singing
 maa kii sunai kahaniyon kaa asar bhi girija ji par padaa
 In this way, Malve's beauty and music soaked him from childhood and filled him with the sensations of the poet within
 lok chitt ko chune vaale aise bimb unke praarambhik sangrahon 'manjeer', 'dhoop ke dhan' aadi ke geeton main dekhne ko milte hai
 Drank the spring flowers filled with juice
 
 
 geet kii sanrachana main jo lokgandhi lay he vah malwa ke usee parivesh kii dein he jahaan unka janm hua
 The experience of the village is world wide
 log bhale hi bhautik rup se sampann na hon par vipannataa ke baavjood unke bheetar khushhaali kaa ujaalaa hota he
 People were not destitute of heart even while living in raw rag, silt and thatch corridor
 par kisaani parivesh main paley-bade hone ke kaaran girijakumar maathur kii prakruti bhi kisaani jivan se samras thi
 Mathur received intermediate education from Jhansi and BA from Gwalior
 is umr tak ve kavitt, savaiye or chand main praveen ho chuke the, maithilisharan gupt tab unki kavita ke role model the
 Makhanlal Chaturvedi, Nirala, Mahadevi had a combined effect on him
 pehali kavita maakhan laal chaturvedi sampadit karmveer main chhapi
 Karmaveer had his own reputation in the magazines of the freedom struggle
 1936 sahitya kii drushti se aitihaasik samay he
 When Godan was published this year, the first session of the Progressive Writers Association was held in Lucknow
 san 36 main hi karmveer main prakashit girijakumar maathur kii pehali kavita manjeer main shaamil hui, jo 1941 main chapa, jisaki bhoomika niraala jaise krantikari kavi ne likhi
 This role was not a follow-up to the tradition of writing a complimentary role on a new poet's collection
 niraala ne man se pehali baar kavitaaon kii antarvastu main pravesh karte hue girijakumar maathur ke kavyatatv kii saraahna kii thi
 Girijakumar Mathur, while doing MA in Lucknow, came in contact with Ram Vilas Sharma, who introduced him to Nirala
 yah sanyog hi he ki unka vivaah shakunt maathur se hua jinhen tarasptak parampara main agyeya ji ne shaamil kiya
 They are the only couple involved in the Saptak tradition
 maathur kaa kavitarambh 1936 tak ho chukaa tha tathaa 1943 tak aakar unhen kaviyon ke bich pahachaanaa jane laga tha
 His collection Manjir, which came in 1941 and Nirala's role on it, added to his poetry
 '43 main tarasptak main shaamil hone ke pehle hi ve kuch chuninda kaviyon main shumaar kiye jane lage the
 They consisted of both progress and experimental streams
 unki kavita apane rup ke prati sachet hoti hui bhi kathy ke prati anudaar nahin dikhti
 It is a must that all the poets of Tarasaptak have been faithful to life
 pragati or prayog ko algane kaa kaam doosraa saptak ke aane ke baad hua
 Many poets of Saptak were quite progressive; Whether Ram Vilas Sharma, Girijakumar Mathur, Muktibodh
 
 
 khud agyeya bhi apane chaakachiky ke baavjood pragatisheel jivan mulyon ke kavi the
 Girijakumar Mathur has often expressed faith in Marxism and Marxist principles in his statements
 ve kehete hai, ''marxvad ke sphurtidayak or prerana bhare saamaajik, raajnneetik, aarthik or dwandvatmak aadhaar par itihaas ke vikaas or parivartan ke siddhanton kaa mere man main maanviya samvednaa or apane samskruti mulyon se jud kar hua
 In fact, i imbibed Marxism by planting it in the soil of our country's public tradition and cultural eminence and got a new life vision
 mukti ke vahi mulya meri kavita ko zankrut or uddipt karte rahe hai
 "it is an influence in the poems of Manjir and Nash and Nirman, it continued to flourish and develop even in the further collections, incense paddy, shilpankhan luminous, the witness is present, i am of the time
 unamem ek taraf lok chetana thi, to duusari taraf vaigyanik chetana bhi
 The introduction of new poetry plays unique Ragini in his songs and poems, while his poems have a close relationship with history and reality
 ve us daur ke kavi rahe hai jab vishwa do-do vishwayudhon se guzar kar ghayal avasthaa main tha
 Hiroshima and Nagasaki were shocked at the horrific genocide that rocked human existence and human rights
 desh saath ke daur ke mohabhang se gujara, apatkaal dekha unhone, aazaadee kii vyarthta bhi
 But he remained bound by his progressive values of life
 unke saamne kavita main anek andolan aae-gaye
 Progressivism, experimentalism, new poetry, movement of poetry of Akvita, Navgeet and kisim-kisim, a long list of which Jagdish Gupta has enumerated in his chapters, but Girijakumar Mathur did not forget Akavita, nor did his poetry in disillusionment Made
 ve masti or romani geet likhte or gaate rahe, to jivan or vichaardhaara kaa andolit karne vaali samasyaon se bhi jujhate rahe
 There is experimental modernism in his poetry as well as progressive consciousness
 nai kavita ke unmesh ke saath unke yahaan apurv taazgi bhi dikhti he to bahut baad main ubhare navagit andolan ke bahut pehle se unke geet nae kavy kaa prastaavan kahe ja sakate hai
 Girijakumar Mathur has written in a voluminous volume
 par praaia: unke geeton main vyaapt romentic chhavi va maansalata se unhen zyada pahachaanaa jaataa rahaa he
 Secondly, his poetry is dominated by image-majority which has been targeted by critics
 shaayad isiilie unhen rupavaadi frem kaa kavi bhi kaha samajha jaataa rahaa he
 But Mathur ji himself has denied this
 ve kehete hai ki ''mere bimb upree sajaavat yaa alankaran bhi nahin hai
 
 
 Rather stemmed from my own reality
 vah meri anubhav kii duniya kaa yatharth he
 "he says," i belong to the region where there have been poets like Kalidas who wrote Meghdoot, Vikramorvashiyya and Abhigyan Shakuntal and also the historical poetry Raghuvansh
 lihaaja jaise kalidas ko keval prem va shringaar kaa kavi nahin kaha ja saktaa, usee tarah mere prayogon main geeton kavitaaon main maalavi kamaniyata hote hue bhi mujhe keval shringaarik kavi kah kar nahin samajha ja saktaa
 i have lived completely free from attachment and life
 ''girijakumar maathur kii kavitaaon main vindhya ke mohak patharon or chattani nadiyon ke harharaate pravaah kii si kal-kal kavitaaon main sun padati he
 The fung there, the fun there, the folk there, the crops, the working women, the kind of village animals and the sounds of birds and birds that the ninad produces within the poet resonates in the poem of Mathur, not to say That the human ambient sounds are in Mathur's poetry, not in his contemporaries
 maathur ke geet praaia: nai kavita va pragativaadee daur main likhe gaye hai
 
 
 There is weather, there are seasons, there are images of fields and barns, and there is a tinkle that tingles and beats the readers' tastes through the poet's mind
 ve dukh se bhigaa hua geet likhte hai to usamen bhi bhavishya kii ujaas ojhal nahin hone dete
 'don't touch the shadow, will hurt your mind'
 
 
 
 When the song from this gloomy mood reaches its final stop, the poet says - duality is courage, the cult does not look happy, but the end of the sorrow of the mind is not seen, nor what happened when the moon blossomed on autumn night If you do not go, you can forget the future and you can choose it
 (chaaya mat choona man, prishth 12)rachana yatra: manjeer se prithvikalp takunakaa pehla sangrah manjeer saras rachanaaon kaa sangrah he, isliye pehali hi nigaah main niraala ko bha gaya
 Needless to say that with the publication of Manjir, Girijakumar Mathur started to become his own identity among the poets
 bolchaal kii lay ke geet isamen adhiktar hai
 You have to walk a bit further, you settle down in these songs, all the boons are gone, i lost my life, you did not recognize love, goodbye why are you full of time, love was very cruel
 maathur main mahadevi kii-si vednaa bhi he
 There is a very thin shadow of this anguish in his songs
 naash or nirmaan kii kavitaayen andhere or ujaale kii hai
 His third collection called Dhoop Ke Paddy came out in 1955
 is sangrah main ve oj ke kavi ke rup main saamne aate hai
 Like a Gandhian patriot, he had a Gandhi-like concern about religion, sect, etc
 kalidas ke ilaake ke is prakruti premi kavi main jo prakruti kaa raag-vistaar he, use dekhte hue krishnadutt paliwal jaise aalochak kaa kahana he ki unke kavi karm main deh ke ras raag ke saath hi aatma kaa sangeet bhi bajataa sunai detaa he
 If a resemblance is found in the forest of Satpura in Dhakbani, then the awakening of Asia is worthy to be kept at par with the irredeemable of the unknowable, once again in this collection, the magic of his image speaks
 1961 main aayaa shilapankh chamkile yugin visangatiyon kaa kavy he
 This is the period when compositions like Atmajayi and Andhayug were written
 aazaadee kaa mohabhang apane charam par tha
 Poets used to call for a new era
 diyadhri va dhakvani jaisi kavitaaon main malwa ke bachapan ke landscape milte hai jisamen lokarangon kaa praadhanya he
 In his next poetic journey to the inner river, he appears as a poet and a ruthless poet
 '75 main aae is sangrah main phir unka romentic or udaatt rup ubharta he
 It was also a revival of the well-known image of Mathur
 is sangrah kaa pehla hi geet is baat kii gavaahi detaa he: phir ghumde vahi megh, phir aayaa yaad pyaar / phir khilne lage pahile pahile ke harsingaar
 But in this collection, on the lines of Nirala's 'she Breaking Stones', Mathur expresses the struggle of a laborer in the poem 'brick on Dusky' which sees the poet's mirror of his modernity
 vartmaan se sarokaar or kavi-chintabhitari nadi kii yatra ke baad unke do mahatvapurn sangrah aae
 Witness be present and i am in front of time
 yah vah samay tha jab ve yatharth se ankhen milakar likh rahe the
 In both collections, their social concerns prevail
 haalanki in sangrahon se pehle kalpantar main hi ve apane vakt kii traasadee ko dekh chuke the
 It is the poet's prayer for the rising humanity towards mass destruction as a result of the dominance of poetic superpowers and the display of military powers
 ham peeche rus-checkoslovakia, america-vietnam, germany naaji hinsa, america ke world trade tower kaa dhwans, bharat-paak kii har vakt kii tanatani, america-afghanistan va america-iraq sangharsh kaa hashr dekh chuke hai
 Obviously, there is an atmosphere of splendor, luxury, decadence-oriented civilization, war, unrest, fascist powers and arms race
 kalpantar inhen vyaadhiyon ke prati kavi-chintaa kaa kavy he
 Almost in the same mood, his poetic drama Earth came in 1994
 yah prithvi ke kalp-kalpantaron kii udbhavgatha he
 This poetry gives an idea of girijakumar Mathur's polytheism
 isaki antarvastu main vaigyanik, darshanik, shabdaawaliyon ke liye anek nae shabd unhone die hai jo ki koshkaron ke liye bhi shaayad nutan paribhaashiki ho
 This is the saga of man's creation, a world made of fantasy and metaphors that is awaited to solve all the questions
 main vakt ke hoon saamne jab aayaa to ve us yugin mode par the jab bhumandalikaran kii aahat aane lagi thi
 The era of liberalism and world-marketism was about to begin
 bharat main aarthik sudhaaron kaa maahaul ban hi rahaa tha
 At that time he was saying, 'I have only words which are the weapons of time
 ' janvari '94 main apane nidhan ke purv ve shabdon ke darpan main apane vakt kaa cheharaa pard rahe the
 In Hindi poetry, whenever there is talk of man's raga, its beauty and earthly reality and the earth struggling with the fears of wars, the poetry of Mathur will be in front of us like a mirror
 unki kavitaaon se manushyata kii, maatrubhaasha kii sugandh aati he

 Regarding bjp's 2004 election slogan, 'india Shining', Rahul Gandhi asks the young man wearing a red sweater, "what does India Shining mean?" "the answer is instantly," India is shining
 '' 11 farvari kii dopaher ko elahabaad ke paas psoranv main juty bheed taaliyaan bajaati he or naare lagane lagati he
 Rahul raises his hand to calm the crowd
 ve kehete hai, ''lekin yah galat he
 If the BJP had just said that India would shine, then maybe, you would have voted for them in 2009
 agar bhaajapa ke netaaon ne aapse or aapse (ek yuva or ek yuvati kii taraf ishaara karte hai) baat kii hoti, to aapane unhen bataaya hota ki 'mere maa-baap chand rupayon ke liye raat-din kaam karte hai
 i go to school, where teachers don't teach, and i don't know if I'll be able to go to college
 or phir bhi aap kah rahe hai ki india shin kar rahaa he
 'if they had come to your house, as i have come, they would have understood that India is not shining
 lekin ve kehete hai ki unhone tivi par ek vigyaapan dekha jisamen tha ki bharat chamak rahaa he, thik vaise hi jaise yahaan bahuguna ji kii jacket chamak rahi he
 "they then move on to Congress candidate Shekhar Bahuguna from Phaphamau with a flashing black turtleneck jacket
 bheed hansane lagati he or bahuguna is baat se damak uthte hai ki unka naam poshaak ke unke chamakate andaaj ke liye liya gaya
 To create a new effect of sloganeering, Rahul has merged bjp's 2004 slogan with 2009
 congress mahasachiv kii reliyaan achaanak aisi samuhik ghatana ban gai hai, jinamein bheed bhi shaamil hoti he or ummidavaar bhi
 Rahul has learned how to conduct the rest of the election campaign
 uttar pradesh main unke chunaav prachaar ke shuruaati daur main aisa nahin tha
 At that time there was little talk from the crowd or the party candidates sitting on the stage
 rahul ke bhaashanon main centre kii uplabdhiyon par vistaar se charchaa hoti thi
 His favorite issues were the Right to Information Act, Food Security Bill and MNREGA
 sthaneey muddon kaa zikr nahin ke baraabar tha
 See his visit to eastern Uttar Pradesh in the last week of November 2011
 ve maharajaganj ke incephelitis prabhavit ilaakon main or balrampur ke ganna kisaanon ke bich gaye, lekin unhone ilaake kii samasyaon kaa koi zikr nahin kiya
 Now Rahul tries to add local color to his speeches
 unke shuruaati bhaashan rate-rataae se najar aate the, ab bhaawanaaon or haav-bhaavon ke saath bhaashan die jate hai
 a favorite style is to punch in the air to emphasize an issue
 bhaashan ke aakhir main ve vinamrata ke saath 'thank you' kehete hai
 Even though this lack of familiarity has been fulfilled, the mystery remains
 ek hairaan sthaneey gram pradhan shilapati yadav ne kaha, ''rahul bhaiya hindi main bole
 i understand that they have studied abroad, so they must not know Hindi
 ''jahaan mahilaon ko unka india shining kaa chutkula pasand aayaa, vahiin purushon ko unka yah vaada pasand aayaa ki ve kisaanon ke liye kaam karte rahenge, chaahe congress ko do siten milen yaa 400 siten milen

 Rahul ensures that the local candidates are allowed to address the crowd before them
 is dauraan ve apane blueberi main uljhe rahete hai
 When Rampal Yadav, a candidate from Raniganj assembly constituency, excitedly addressed him as 'the pride of the youth, the life of the farmers', Rahul shook hands towards the crowd
 unhone bheed ko khush karne vaali baaten shuru kar di hai
 At a rally in Lucknow on February 15, he tore a paper, saying that the public did not benefit from the high promises of the opposition
 rahul ke bharosemand sahaayak kanishka singh bhaashan ke dauraan manch ke peeche sthaneey netaaon se milte hai
 They note local issues and the names of the candidates and then hand them over to Rahul
 chote kad ke, chashme vaale kanishka rahul ke abhiyaan ke ahm shilpkaar ban kar ubhare hai
 Congressmen are realizing that the easiest way to reach Rahul is to SMS Kanishka
 is ilaake ke hindibhashi netaa akasar patrakaron se kehete hai ki ve 'ke' (kanishka ko isi naam se pukaara jaataa he) ke liye angreji main esemes taiyaar karne main madad kar den
 a party worker, upset over missing the chance to meet 'K' after Rahul's helicopter flies, asks, "who was that little boy?" Kanishka Singh? ”rahul made another important reform in the middle campaign just before the first round of voting
 congress netaa bataate hai ki shuruyaat main unke abhiyaan kaa nishaanaa mayawati thim
 When rumors of a hung assembly began to pick up, a discussion of a possible compromise broke out between the Congress and the SP
 jab yah najar aane laga ki sapa badhat le rahi he, to yah chintaa shuru hui ki vah congress kaa vot bank nigal sakati he, kyonki donon partiyaan muslim-kurmi-pichde vot bank ko manaane kii koshish kar rahi hai
 Rahul then held a press conference in Varanasi on 6 February, in which he categorically stated that the Congress would not support the Samajwadi Party
 unhone basapa ko choron kii party or sapa ko gundon kii party qaraar diya
 This juggle seems somewhat effective
 psoranv raily main shaamil hone aae elahabaad hycourt ke vakil vijay agarwal kehete hai, ''jab tak rahul ne yah nahin kaha tha ki vah sapa kaa samarthan nahin karenge, main to basapa ko vot dene ja rahaa tha
 BSP people may be thieves, but SP is a goon party
 ham unhen nahin chaahate
 "congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh further clarified Rahul's point and said," If we cannot form a government, then President's rule will be applicable in the state
 ''congress ke bheetar yah vichaar chal rahaa he ki abhi koi mili-juli sarkaar bananaa 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main party ke liye aatmghaatee sabit hoga
 Apart from the anti-incumbency trend, the alliance with SP will also swallow the vote bank that Rahul has mobilized from his campaign
 pradesh congress kii adhyaksh reeta bahuguna joshi kahati hai, ''ham vahi sarkaar nahin thope sakate, jise janata thukraa chuki ho
 We are not hungry for power
 ham intjaar karenge
 "elections are being overseen by Digvijay Singh and Rahul's Youth Congress is helping him
" bheed bhi youth congress kaa kader hi jutata he
 For the purpose of the election campaign, the Congress has divided the state into 10 zones, each zone having roughly 40 assembly seats and eight Lok Sabha seats
 har jone ke liye ek jonal prekshak he
 Eight other people report to these observers, who cover every Lok Sabha seat
 ye log adhikanshtah youth congress ke kaaryakarta or uttar pradesh ke baahar ke party vidhayak hai
 The Northeast alone has about 15 mlas and has been camping in the state for the last three months
 uttar pradesh ke congress netaa or media prachaar samiti ke sadsy surendra rajput kehete hai, ''yah atyant peshewar or sangathit dhaancha he jisaki pahunch digvijay singh ke jariye sidhe rahul se he
 "union Ministers Rajiv Shukla and Digvijay Singh oversee the media briefing, while MP Raj Babbar played an important role in deciding the draft of the campaign
" rahul kaa abhiyaan kaarykram dilli main unke karyaalay se tay hota he
 Then it is faxed to Lucknow
 isse kabhi-kabhi bhram paidaa ho jaataa he
 For example, on 11 February, Rahul's rally in Amethi was scheduled by his office in Delhi for 3 pm
 lekin amethi main party kaaryakartaaon ko laga ki raily dopaher 12 baje hogi
 When Rahul did not reach even by 5 pm, the crowd began to retrench
 ek naaraaz mahila ne kaha, ''chunaav ayog ke niyamon ke kaaran hamen ab do samose or ek laddu bhi nahin miltaa
 "A Congress worker regretfully said," This never happens in any Mayawati rally
 unke voter kahin zyada patibaddh hai
 This is also perhaps the biggest challenge facing Rahul's mission Uttar Pradesh

 There was an opportunity in Parliament to surround the government on the motion of no confidence, but the example of what happened today will be given again and again in the coming times
 loksabhaa main aaj ek aitihaasik tasviir dekhne ko mili
 During the debate on the no confidence motion in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi attacked the Modi government fiercely, but all the members present in the house were shocked when Rahul Gandhi went straight to PM Modi's seat after finishing the speech and embraced Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 ise is saal kii sabase aitihaasik raajnneetik tasviir kaha jaae to koi harj nahin hoga
 The final part of Rahul Gandhi's speech was the reason for this picture, in which he said that no matter how much you abuse, i have love for you
 aap mujhe kitna bhi pappu kah lo, main aapse nafrat nahin prem karuunga
 i am the Congress and this is the spirit of the Congress
 yah bhaavana aapke andar bhi he or main aap sabake andar se is bhaavana ko nikaaloongaa or aap sabko congress main badaloongaa
 Rahul used to say that most of the mps in Parliament laughed
 khudloksabhaspikar is baat par hans rahi thim
 However, Rahul did not care for it and moving fast got closer to PM Modi
 rahul ne gale lagane ke liye piem modi se uthne kaa aagrah kiya
 However, PM Modi was shocked by this sudden act of Rahul and refused to get up
 haalanki rahul vahaan nahin ruke or piem modi ko jaakar jor se gale laga liya
 After this, Rahul started going back
 kuch samay tak piem ko vishwaas nahin ho rahaa tha, lekin unhone khud ko sambhala or rahul se waapas lautne ko kaha
 When Rahul returned, PM Modi shook hands with him and patted him
 is dauraan piem modi or rahul ke bich kya baatcheet hui, mike on nahin hone kii vajah se wo baat sabake saamne nahin aa pai
 However, this style of Rahul and his embrace of power and opposition became recorded in history and it became the most historical picture of this year
 lagaataar ho rahe the hamaleapako bataa den ki yah gale lagaana isliye bhi aitihaasik rahaa kyonki bijepi avishvaas prastaav shuru hone se pehle se hirahul gandhipar lagaataar hamale kar rahi thi
 Just before the no-confidence motion, BJP MP Giriraj Singh tweeted a tweet on Rahul Gandhi
 giriraaj ne twit main likhaa tha ki- bukamp ke maze lene ke liye taiyaar ho jaaie
 Giriraj was to tweet that the tweet was flooded with the hashtag 'earthquake is about to come' on social media
 giriraaj ke is twit ko rahul gandhi ke us bayaan se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he jisamen rahul ne kaha tha ki agar unhen sansad main 15 minute bolne diya jaae to bukamp aa jayega
 At the same time, even when Rahul Gandhi's speech in the Parliament slipped, BJP mps laughed at him a lot
 rahul gandhi apane bhaashan main jiesti ko lekar bijepi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadh rahe the
 After this, as soon as he started speaking on PM Modi's foreign visits, his tongue slipped
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki jab piem 'baar' jate hai
 Here he meant 'outside' from outside
 unhone angreji main matlab samajhaate hue kaha ki matlab ebrod (abroad) yani jab piem obama, trump aadi se milane jate hai
 By that time it was too late
 bijepi ke netaa unke is bayaan par hansane lage
 Also, PM Modi could not stop his laughter and started laughing loudly
 rahul ne kaha- koi lathi maare par tumhaare dil main uske liye pyaar hona chahievahin bijepi ne rafel par rahul ke bayaan kii bhi kadi aalochana kii thi
 Rahul had said that Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman lied to the country under the pressure of PM Modi
 in sabake baavjood rahul ne piem modi ko gale lagaaya or ab unka yah andaaj itihaas main darj ho chukaa he
 Earlier, Rahul Gandhi said, 'I am grateful to the Prime Minister and the RSS that they explained to me the meaning of Congress
 inhone hindustani hone kaa matlab samajhaayaa
 Hindustani means, no matter what you say, abuse, lie, lathi, you should have love for it in your heart
 ye baat narendra modi ji, bijepi or aresas ne mujhe sikhaaya
 i thank you heartily for this

 After the dream of a sweep sweep in the ODI series, Team India achieved success in winning the ODI series, but fell behind in the T20
 vaise bhi windies ke khilaaf tii-20 main bharat kaa record kharaab rahaa he
 Although he had a chance of winning this time, two lifespans to Windies opener Evin Lewis turned the map of the match
 iskaa phayda uthaate hue levis ne tufaani shatak lagaaya or windies ko jeet dilaa di
 Encouraged by the win, Windies captain Carlos Brathwaite reacted to India's defeat, saying Team India fell behind in one case, otherwise the match could go in its favor
 
 
 bharat ke khilaaf siries ke ekmaatr tii-20 match main jeet darj karne ke baad brathwet ne kaha ki team india ne pehle batting karte hue shuruyaat to acchhee kii thi, lekin usne bich ke overon main lay kho di
 As a result, she fell behind by 20 runs in the goal
 brathwet kii maane, to aisa karne par match kisi bhi taraf ja saktaa tha or team india kii batting ke baad unhen iskaa ahsaas ho gaya tha
 Significantly, it seemed at one time that Team India would score around 230-240, but she could only manage 190 runs after losing six wickets after playing the entire 20 overs
 crickinfo ne brathwet ke hawaale se likhaa he, "kesaric wilimyas ne chathe over main do ahm wicket liye
 After that when Jerome Taylor came back to bowl, he finished his spell well, so that we could return to the match
 ham sabhi soch rahe the ki bharat 20 ran peeche rah gaya or hamaare ballebaajon ne ise sahi sabit kiya
 " unhone aage kaha, "wicket kaaphi acha tha
 We managed to stop him for 190 runs, it was good for us, especially after the way he started, doing so was a big achievement
 " Windies coach Stuart Law was expected to score around 240, seeing India's debut
 lau ne match ke baad samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, "acchhee wicket, chote maidan or tej outfield par bharat ne jis tarah se shuruyaat kii thi use dekhakar mujhe laga ki hamane unhen 190 ranon par roak acha kaam kiya

 We did not start well with the ball, but did end well
 " Commending Lewis for his century, the captain said, "he is a young player who plays very positively

 america raashtrapati ke ghar white house se 24 may kii dopaher ko ek letters jari hota he
 The letter was named after North Korean dictator Marshall Kim Jong Un
 khat donald trump kii taraf se tha
 It was written in the letter that the meeting in Singapore on June 12 is currently being canceled
 idhar kim ko khat miltaa he
 Meanwhile, journalists from all over the world are taken to a particular place in North Korea after a few hours
 phir un patrakaron ke saamne ek ke baad ek kai dhamaake hote hai
 But after the breakup of Trump and Kim, these blasts were completely different from all the previous ones
 kim ne nibhaayaa vaadauttar korea kii newclear site par dhamaake hue
 These blasts were on one side
 duusari taraf wo letters bam
 On the one hand, North Korea fulfilled its promise and on the other side America reverted to its promise
 kamaal kaa ittefaq tha ye
 On 24th of May, this letter of America first appears on Thursday
 or phir uske kuch hi ghante baad uttar korea ke bamon kii factory ko barood se udaati tasviren saamne aati hai
 We are talking about nuclear nuclear blast sites, they are not bomb blasts
 balki parmaanu bam banane vaali newclear site ko tabah karne ke liye kiye ja rahe dhamaake hai
 On the evening of May 24, North Korea destroyed its nuclear site as promised, in the presence of journalists around the world
 laga ab sab thik ho jayega
 But it did not happen
 tal gai mulakatbus haath or gale milane hi vaale the
 The clash of bombs was about to be resolved
 tisare vishwa yuddh kaa khatra talane hi vaala tha
 But only then
 ji haa
 Then comes the letter of US President Donald Trump at the last moment and everything ends for the moment
 vishwa shanti ke liye 12 june ko singapore main hone vaali trump or kim kii mulaakaat tal jaati he
 Trump canceled meeting Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump will not meet at the moment
 12 june ko singapore main hone vaali meeting radd ho gai he
 Kim Jong Un is angry at the cancellation of the meeting
 singapore main kim jong un ke saath hone vaali meeting ko radd karne ke peeche
 US President Donald Trump has argued that Kim is still making provocative talks
 aise main is vakt baatcheet kaa koi matlab nahin he
 The US vice-president was told that according to public opinion Trump was angry with Kim for calling US vice-president Mike Pins an 'idiot'
 kim ne haal hi main mike ko bevakoof kaha tha
 Indeed, US Vice President Mike Pins made a statement in the past that if North Korea is not deterred by the testing of nuclear bombs, then the US will not shy away from adopting the Gaddafi policy against it
 is bayaan ke baad kim ne america up-raashtrapati ko bevakoof bolaa tha
 Kim's minister had given the statement that this new conversation between the two countries started with the statement of North Korean minister Cho Son-hui
 jinhone amareeki up-raashtrapati mike pence ko trump kaa bayaan dohraane ko lekar unhen siyaasi kathputli qaraar diya tha
 In fact, US National Security Advisor John Bolton had said before he took office that talks with him until North Korea destroys all its nuclear and chemical weapons have no meaning
 or trump kim se milakar apana vakt jaaya karenge
 Trump changed his attitude; Trump quickly changed his stance and made it clear by writing this letter that you talk about your nuclear capability but our nuclear weapons are very big and powerful, i pray to God never to use them
 Had to do
 libya model par vivamb america ko lagata he ki kim ko baatcheet ke liye libya model apnaanaa chahie
 Let me tell you that after the denuclearization process in 2003, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had to stop his nuclear program completely
 bas isi baat par uttar korea bhadak gaya tha
 He threatened America in his style
 libya se tulana par bhadkaa kimauttar korea ek parmaanu taaqat he jiske paas intercontinental belistic missile hai, jinhen thermoneuclear hathiyaaron par feet kar istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 In comparison, Libya made only a few devices
 kim ne saaf kaha ki wo wo apane saare parmaanu hathiyaaron ko kabhi khatm nahin karegaa
 Neither today nor tomorrow or agar parmaanu hathiyaaron ko khatm hi karnaa he to akele uttar korea kyon kare
 Why should America not also
 jisane saikadon kii taadaad main parmaanu hathiyaar bana rakhen hai
 However, despite this argument on both sides, the expectation of a conversation is not yet over
 agar aap is ahm mulaakaat ko karne ke liye apana man badalen to mujhe phone karne yaa chitthee likhane main sankoch na karen
 North Korea is extremely angry with Trump's changed move
 lekin baavjood iske usne doharaaya he ki wo america ke saath kootnithik prakriya kahin bhi or kabhi bhi shuru karne ko taiyaar he

 'sholay', which was released on the occasion of Independence Day in 1975, 40 years ago, like hundreds of thousands of other films, had nothing new in the story, and interestingly, critics almost unanimously rejected it
 , But despite this, the film eventually gained the space that no one has found till today, after the number of films reached 100-200-300-crore club

 After you start writing about 'sholay', it becomes difficult to understand, what to write, what to leave, but there is so much in our generation about this film that whatever you write, whatever you read, it seems less

 'sholay' kaa ek-ek kirdaar, ek-ek samvaad, ek-ek drishy aaj bhi lagbhag sabhi darshakon ko jis tarah yaad he, us tarah to apane course kii kitaaben bhi kisi ko yaad nahin hotin

 The comments 'sholay' main jis vakt 'gabbar singh' gusse main cheekhta hua 'thakur baldev singh' ke haath kaat detaa he, sabhi darshakon kii saansen ruk-si jaati hai
 
 
 And finally, when the handicapped 'thakur Baldev Singh' is beating 'gabbar Singh' by screaming in the same way, the teeth of every spectator remain
 
 
 in donon drishyon ke alaava dheron aise drishy 'sholay' ne hamen die hai, jo aaj bhi zahan main tazaa hai

 Produced by GP Sippy, directed by Ramesh Sippy and helmed by Rahuldev Burman, 'sholay' starred Dharmendra, Sanjeev Kumar, Hema Malini, Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bhaduri and 'gabbar Singh' as amjad Khan is possible to forget No, but Jagdeep turned 'surma Bhopali', Asrani in the role of 'british-era jailer', Keshto Mukherjee playing 'hariram Nai', 'imam Sahab Sachin Pilgaonkar as' Bane AK Hangal, 'his grandson', Leela Mishra in the role of 'basanti Ki Mausi', Viju Khote as' Kalia 'and mcmahon as' Sambha' are not forgotten
 
 
 kirdaaron ke alaava 'sholay' ke dialog bhi hamaare zahan main is tarah rach-bas chuke hai ki aaj bhi sunai dete rahete hai
 
 
 Let us remind you some of them
 
 
 kitne aadmi the
 
 
 Give me this hand, Thakur

 Now what will happen to you, Kalia

 'sholay' ko lekar likhnaa shuru karne ke baad samajhnaa mushkil ho jaataa he, kya likhen, kya choden, lekin hamaari peedi ke man main is film ko lekar itnaa kuch basaa hua he ki jitna bhi likho, jitna bhi padho, kam hi lagata he
 
 
 Everyone remembers almost everything, but still the feeling of getting into old memories while reading, feels exactly the same as it looks when looking at old pictures of his or her family's childhood
 
 
 so, aapako inhen yaadon main duubate-tarte chhodkar main chalata hum, or mauka pate hi sabase pehle ek baar phir dekhuunga 'sholay'
 
 
 In 'sholay', when 'gabbar Singh' angrily cuts off the hand of 'thakur Baldev Singh', the breath of all the audience stops
 
 
 or ant main, jis samay apahiz 'thakur baldev singh' usee tarah cheekhte hue 'gabbar singh' ko maar rahe hai, us samay har darshak ke daant bhinche rahete hai
 
 
 Apart from these two scenes, 'sholay' has given us many such scenes, which are still fresh in the mind
 
 
 chaahe vah 'viru' kaa pani kii tank par chadhakar 'suicide' karnaa ho, yaa 'jai' kaa 'mausi' ko 'viru-basanti' ke rishte ke liye manaane kii koshish karnaa
 
 
 Whether 'jai' has to ask 'basanti' his name, or 'basanti' pleading to save his honor from 'dhanno'
 
 
 chaahe vah 'gabbar' kaa 'kaaliya' ko dhamkaana ho, yaa 'viru' kaa chikhakar 'basanti se kutton ke saamne nahin naachne ke liye' kahana
 
 
 Whether it is to boast of 'surma Bhopali', or to question Imam Saheb about the 'silence' in the village
 
 
 jeepi sippi dwaara nirmit, ramesh sippi dwaara nirdeshit or rahuldev burman ke sangeet se saji 'sholay' main mukhya bhoomikaaon main dikhe dharmendra, sanjeev kumaar, hema malini, amitabh bachchan, jaya bhadudi or 'gabbar singh' bane amjad khan ko bhoolanaa to mumkin hi nahin he, lekin 'suurama bhopali' bane jagadeep, 'angrezon ke jamaane ke jailer' kii bhoomika main asraani, 'hariraam nai' kaa kirdaar nibhaate keshto mukherjee, 'imam sahab' bane eke hangal, 'unke pote' kii bhoomika main sachin pilganvkar, 'basanti kii mausi' ke kirdaar main lila mishra, 'kaaliya' bane viju khote or 'sambha' bane macmohan bhi kisi ko bhuule nahin bhoolatey
 
 
 Apart from the characters, the dialogue of 'sholay' has also been created in our mind in such a way that it is heard even today
 
 
 aaie, aapako unamem se kuch aapako yaad dilaate hai
 
 
 How many men were there
 
 
 ?ye haath hamako de de, thakur
 
 
 The one who got scared, died
 
 
 ab tera kya hoga, kaaliya
 
 
 ?why so much silence brother
 
 
 ?tumhaara naam kya he, basanti
 
 
 ? We are jailers of the British era
 
 
 kab he holi
 
 
 ? Hey O, Sambha
 
 
 chal dhanno, aaj teri basanti kii izzat kaa sawaal he
 
 
 After you start writing about 'sholay', it becomes difficult to understand, what to write, what to leave, but there is so much in our generation about this film that whatever you write, whatever you read, it seems less 
 
 
 sabhi ko lagbhag sab kuch yaad he, lekin phir bhi padhate vakt puraani yaadon main utarane kaa jo ehsaas hota he, vah bilkul vaisaa hi mahasoos hota he, jaisaa apane yaa apane parivaar ke bachapan kii puraani tasviren dekhte vakt lagata he
 
 
 So, leaving you drowning in these memories, i walk, and i will see 'sholay' for the first time once i get the chance
 
 
 in donon drishyon ke alaava dheron aise drishy 'sholay' ne hamen die hai, jo aaj bhi zahan main tazaa hai
 
 
 Whether it is 'veeru' climbing on the water tank to 'suicide', or 'jai' trying to convince 'aunt' to 'veeru-basanti' relationship
 
 
 chaahe 'jai' kaa 'basanti' se uskaa naam poochna ho, yaa 'basanti' kaa 'dhanno' se apni izzat bachaane kii guhaar karnaa
 
 
 Whether it is 'gabbar' threatening 'kalia', or 'veeru' shouting and saying 'basanti not to dance in front of dogs'
 
 
 chaahe vah 'suurama bhopali' kaa dingen haankna ho, yaa imam sahab kaa gaanv main pasre 'sannaate' ke bare main sawaal karnaa
 
 
 Produced by GP Sippy, directed by Ramesh Sippy and helmed by Rahuldev Burman, 'sholay' starred Dharmendra, Sanjeev Kumar, Hema Malini, Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bhaduri and 'gabbar Singh' as amjad Khan is possible to forget No, but Jagdeep turned 'surma Bhopali', Asrani in the role of 'british-era jailer', Keshto Mukherjee playing 'hariram Nai', 'imam Sahab Sachin Pilgaonkar as' Bane AK Hangal, 'his grandson', Leela Mishra in the role of 'basanti Ki Mausi', Viju Khote as' Kalia 'and mcmahon as' Sambha' are not forgotten
 
 
 kirdaaron ke alaava 'sholay' ke dialog bhi hamaare zahan main is tarah rach-bas chuke hai ki aaj bhi sunai dete rahete hai
 
 
 Let us remind you some of them
 
 
 kitne aadmi the
 
 
 Give me this hand, Thakur
 
 
 jo dar gaya, samajho mar gaya
 
 
 Now what will happen to you, Kalia
 
 
 ?itnaa sannata kyon he, bhai
 
 
 What is your name, Basanti
 
 
 ?ham angrezon ke jamaane ke jailer hai
 
 
 When is holi 
 
 ?are o, sambha
 
 
 Chal Dhanno, today it is a question of respect for your spring
 
 
 'sholay' ko lekar likhnaa shuru karne ke baad samajhnaa mushkil ho jaataa he, kya likhen, kya choden, lekin hamaari peedi ke man main is film ko lekar itnaa kuch basaa hua he ki jitna bhi likho, jitna bhi padho, kam hi lagata he
 
 
 Everyone remembers almost everything, but still the feeling of getting into old memories while reading, feels exactly the same as it looks when looking at old pictures of his or her family's childhood
 
 
 so, aapako inhen yaadon main duubate-tarte chhodkar main chalata hum, or mauka pate hi sabase pehle ek baar phir dekhuunga 'sholay'

 If you want to live in the country, then you have to say Vande Mataram, such strong attitude is being shown by Shiv Sainiks in Pune
 beete shuukravaar ko ek prastaav paarit kiya gaya, jisamen kaha gaya he ki shahar ke sabhi mahanagarapalika skulon main vande maataram gaanaa ab anivaary ho gaya he
 The proposal to sing Vande Mataram has been passed by a majority in the General Body meeting
 haalanki congress or ensipi is prastaav kaa virodh kar rahi hai
 It is now mandatory to sing Vande Mataram in 283 schools of Pune Municipal Corporation
 general body meeting main vande maataram gaanaa anivaary kiye jane ke prastaav ke samarthan main 4 ke badale 37 mat mili or baari bahumat se yah prastaav paarit kar diya gaya
 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Bhosle confirmed this to Aaj Tak and said that there is love for the country, why is it avoided in singing patriotic songs
 bachapan se bacchon ko yah geet sikhaaya janaa chahie
 That is why singing Vande Mataram has been made necessary
 sanjay bhosle ne kaha, "shivasena ke netaa 15 agast or 26 janvari ke din skulon main jate hai, jahaan unhone paaya ki bahut se skulon main vande maataram nahin gaaya ja rahaa he or chhatrapati shivaji maharaj kii pratimaa bahut se skulon main hamen dikhi hi nahin
 In such a situation, we had proposed this proposal three months ago in the Municipal Corporation
 ab vah paarit ho gaya he
 The children of today, who are the future generations
 unhen bhi yah geet aana chahie
 They should also sing this song
 isliye hamane yah prastaav rakhaa tha
 "while the Shiv Sena and the BJP are seen standing together on the issue of Vande Mataram, the Congress's notes are different
 congress ke parshad arvind scindia ke mutabik supreme court ke faisle or samvidhan main kahin bhi nahin kaha gaya he ki vande maataram gaanaa anivaary hoga
 Arvind Shinde questioned the patriotism of Shiv Sena leaders and said that if people who are accused of serious crime, they will forget their crime if they sing Vande Mataram to prove their love
 unhone kaha, "jinhone yah prastaav pesh kiya tha, un par police cese darj hai
 Wealth recovery from builders, persecution of builders, all their leaders, there is a police case on each
 ye police se khud kii NOC nahin laa sakate
 Has he ever sung Vande Mataram himself? This proposal is inspired by politics and people are wearing patriotic armor to hide their crimes
 "congress ke aaropon kaa jawaab dete hue shivasena netaa ne na sirf vande maataram gaaya, ulate congress par aarope jad diya ki virodh karne vaale log voton kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai,alpsankhyak ko rijhaane ke lieaise aarope laga rahe hai
 Sanjay Bhosle said, "look at all the cases that have been registered against us, these are the cases of party agitation
 hamane koi murder nahin kiya
 There is no culprit
 ye sab voton ke liye chal rahaa he
 The Congress fears losing its Muslim vote
 "vahiin pune mahanagarapalika kii meyar mukta tilak kaa kahana he, "vaise dekha jaae to congress or ensipi ke bhi bahut se log hai, jin par aapraadhik karrwai hui he
 Both things should not be brought together
 vande maataram alag cheez he or criminal maamle alag cheez hai
 It will run in all the schools which are 283 schools
 jab meyar se urdu skulon ke bare main poocha gaya to unka jawaab tha, "sabhi skulon main
 Along with Vande Mataram, it has been made mandatory to install the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in every school, so that students can know the history of Shivaji Maharaj
 " Apart from this, the number of women helplines and police control rooms on the walls of council schools will be made public to make the students aware
 is sambandh main adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki chaatraon kii suraksha kii jimmedaari vidyalayon kii he
 Teachers have also been told to try to create such an environment that the students can express their problems without any hesitation

 girish ji ko ham tabase jaanate the jab ham rashtriya natya vidhyalay (enesdy) ke chaatr the
 His play Tughlaq Ko (b
 va
 ) Was translated by Karant ji
 om shivpuri ji ko enesdy rapertary main ek naatak nirdeshit karnaa tha
 We were doing roles in it
 vah naatak bahut safal hua
 Girish Karnad became one of the important playwrights
 yayatiunaka pehla naatak tha,jisamen pita hi putr se uskaa yauvan maangata he,puri katha he
 He wrote it at the age of 22-23 and Tughlaq at the age of 25-26
 1938kaa unka janm he or64main likhaa gaya
 Played in Hindustani in 1966
 om shivpuri ne nirdesan ke saath pramukh bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Mohan Maharishi and i worked
 us samay ke dikshant samaaroh ke liye yah mahatvapurn prastuti thi
 The speech was probably given by Agnayji in that convocation
 hindi main girish ji kaa doosraa mahatvapurn naatak hua hayvadan
 We did it with our direction group
 anuwaad bhi karant ji kaa tha or nirdesan bhi
 Our group consisted of Om Shivpuri, Sudha Shivpuri, Karant, Vishwanath Vadola, Banwari (taneja), etc
 girish karnad ke naatakon kaa or kannada naatakon kaa hindi naatakon ke terning point se aitihaasik sambandh he
 If we look at the history of that theater in Hindi theater, it has a relation with Girish Karnad
 yayati maine bhi kiya tha
 Tughlaq was born in Bombay
 kalakatta main shyamanand jalaan ne kiya
 Shambhu Mitra played Tughlaq in it
 hayavdanamen jo dwand he,stri kii jo chwis he,use buddhi bhi chahie or shaareerik yauvan bhi
 This duality is body and mind was also in Tomas Mann's novel
 vetaal pachisi main bhi aata he
 He wrote a play on this
 maine devdattaki bhoomika kii thi
 After Tughlaq, it became very popular and by doing this, Karanth was first established as a big director in Hindi and also in Kannada after moving to Bangalore and Kannada
 hindi main unhone lakhanu main bhi jaakar kiya
 After this, the important work of Girish ji is blood welfare
 unke duusare naatakon kii tarah yah bhi mulat: kannada main tha
 i translated into Hindi and (ibrahim) Alkaji directed
 unkignior barkhaa naatak kaa bhi maine anuwaad kiya
 So this is the duality of body and mind, materiality and subtlety, it has been a matter of concern and business of Girish Karnad
 iske alaava stri man bhi
 When he talks about the caste system and the problems of Varnashram religion in Indian society, when he talks about Rantta Kalyan
 yah bhi dhyaan rahe ki girish swayan ek abhinayta the
 Acted in the films of Shyam Benegal and several other directors
 film institute (amtiiai) ke diarennter rahe
 Were internationally intellectuals
 mahabharat or vaidic kaal ke duusare granth unke padhe hue the
 He was also interested in astronomy
 yani ek vyapak drushtikon
 He used to talk about such a great plane of thinking and thinking, as well as a Liberal Society
 unhone badal sarkaar or mohan maharishi ke kaam ko bhi pasand kiya
 He sought Hindi work and had it staged in the south
 unke naatak bikhare bimb arundhati naag or shabana azmi ne bhi kiya he
 He then wrote a marriage album
 shaadi main kai peedhishon ke tarah-tarah ke log ikatthehote hai
 When there is a rage, ambition and conflict between them, then there is a reflection of the whole society of Karnataka
 ek or naatak unhone likhaa tha,jisko kah lijie uble hue dane jaise raajma
 Put the beans and peas on toast and eat
 usase bangaluru kaa naam padaa
 That means boiled beans
 ise lekar puri ek dantakatha he
 He wrote a play about that
 iskaa hindi anuwaad raajakmal prakaashan chhapane vaala he
 Kannada is accompanied by Girish ji (chandrasekhar) Kambar, who is also a poet, novelist and good playwright
 us rup main girish ji naatakkaar hi the
 He was a good thinker, Jnanpith Award was given to him for his play
 unke naatak bali main hinsa ko lekar chintaa he
 The queen says that if you sacrifice the dough by making a chicken too, then the price has to be cut
 maansik hatya,hinsa to he naa
 He was seen with Jain eyes
 usamen girish ji ne gandhi ke ahimsa ke vichaar ko bhi joda he
 But Girish ji will be remembered mainly for Havayan and Tughlaq
 or abhi tak unke kuchhek naatakon kii bahut achche dhang se prastuti hui nahin he unamem rakt kalyaan ek he
 We once called Girish ji at the convocation of NSD
 usamen unhone dharmaveer bharti ke natakandhayugako lekar ek mahatvapurn baat kahi thi ki'hamane,hamaare samakalinon ne bahut naatak likhe hai lekin sanskrit kaal ke shudrak ke baad koi mahanatak isi hindustan main likhaa gaya he to wo he andhayug'akele andhayug main sampurna bhartiya or aadhunik jagat kii vidhwansavaad or astitv kii samasya,rashtrawaad kii samasya,manushya kii hinsa,yuddh,dharti hi samaapt na ho jaae
 The thinking of the nuclear war that took place after the Second World War is in the dark ages
 girish karnad ne use pahachaanaa or rikgnise kiya
 Despite being a great playwright of Kannada, a non-hindi language, Bharati ji had so much respect for her
 sangeet naatak academy ne andhayug karne vaale rangakarmiyon ko academy award se nawaja lekin bharti ji ko puraskaar nahin mila
 The only thing that came up was that this one of his plays written in the form of a play is blind
 girish ji jab sangeet naatak academy ke adhyaksh hue to unhone kaha ki bhale unhone ek naatak likhaa ho par unhen puraskaar dekar yah galati hamen sudharni hogi
 That lone drama is heavy over the centuries
 unhone bharti ji se anurodh karte hue kaha ki'hamase galati ho gai he,is sammaan ko sweekaar kiijie'to is tarah kaa girish karnad kaa vyaktitv he
 His departure is also a personal loss for me
 *** Many times i wonder whether Nostradamus could have been able to predict cricket matches
 mere vichaar se, yahvishwakapasbhi ke liye khulaa hua he
 Barring the last three teams of the numerical table, almost every team is capable of defeating the other team if they win their game
 pichley dinon hamane do damdaar tiimon ke bich match taai hote hue dekha
 Then we saw Ireland chasing a record target to beat England thanks to Kevin o'brien's tremendous performance from big shots
 dakshin africa jeet kii kagaar se phislaa or saansen tham dene vaale aakhri over main samaapt hue match main england se haar gaya
 The brilliant Pakistani team defeated Sri Lanka in its courtyard, very few teams could do that
 or phir pakistan ek din newjiland ke haathon pit gaya
 Could we expect even more uncertainty? This is great for cricket, especially its 50-over format
 is mod par jo timen is toornament kaa adhikansh romaanch dilaa saki hai- ve hai bharat, england or ireland
 India remains the winner's title contender thanks to its good record
 unke saat bade ballebaaj ek yaa duusare match main chamake hai
 But now India's spin bowlers will also have to come into color soon
 agar bharat ko vishwacap jeetna he, to harbhajan singh ko gole daagne hi honge
 India will have to resolve its selection issues
 masalan, tisare tej gendbaaj ko khilaaen yaa ek or spinner ko? vah spinner koun hoga?england sabhi kism ke jhatkon ke centre main rahaa he
 Despite a defeat and a one-time tie, England have performed better under pressure
 main nahin maanata ki ireland ke khilaaf england haara, balki apane ek khilaadi kii haroonges pari ke boote ireland vah match jeeta tha
 England is the hideout of the World Cup
 england petersan jaise stareey khilaadi ke na hone kaa afsos kar rahaa hoga, jo chot ke kaaran toornament se baahar he
 If England qualify for the quarter-finals, i would like Pietersen to join their team, but the joy is that young Ian Morgan is coming in to replace him
 stuart broad kii gaiyrhaaziri england ke liye ek usase bhi zyada bada dhakka he
 He is the ground warrior, as we saw in the match against South Africa
 vah aisa khilaadi he, jo apane kabhi haar na maanane vaale ravaie ke boote kisi match kaa rukh badal saktaa he
 With the quarter-finals and semi-finals coming, England will want to return to Broad's team
 ab tak is toornament kaa chamakta sitara rahaa he ireland
 His players have played consistently well in all their matches
 unhone harek team ko kadi takkar di he or england ke khilaaf unki jeet kisi pari katha se kam nahin thi
 Much of the credit for that win must go to o'brien for his great batting under pressure
 vah wicket par us samay aae the, jab unki aadhi team waapas dressing room main pahunch chuki thi or team kaa score 100 ran ke aasapaas tha

 # Grurpurab The administration of Bihar has woken up after seeing the sting of 'aaj Tak' revealing the truth of Bihar's exam results and students' answer book evaluation

 According to the information, SDM are interrogating Lalitha Chaudhary
 jahaan unhone apane upar lage saare aaropon ko khaarij kar diya he
 Let us tell you that 'aaj Tak' had shown a sting operation on Wednesday evening, in which Lalita Chaudhary's name was revealed
 kaagaj par lalita choudhary vaishali kendriya inter college kii teacher hai
 But their real job is to run a beauty porter
 ji haa, madam beauty parlor chalaati hai, jo usase vakt bachaa tobihar ke bacchon kii takadiralikhti hai
 Lalita Chaudhary herself confessed that she never saw the face of the class, but checked 50 copies of Hindi daily
 'ajtak' ke sting main lalita jaise kai or jhol najar aae jinhonebihar board ke pariksha parinaamon kii polkhol kar rakh di
 In this case, the chairman of the Bihar School Examination Committee Anand Kishore said while commenting, "we got this sting investigated in 'aaj Tak'
 jisamen paaya gaya ki beauty parlor chalaane vaali mahila lalita choudhary post graduate hai or wo maanak ke mutabik copy kii jaanch kar sakati hai
 "anand Kishore says that there has been an investigation of copying from teachers without finance
 unhone kaha ki kai jagahon se kai madhyamon se shikaayat ai thi unki jaanch sambandhit jiladhikariyon se karai gai lekin kahin gadabadi nahin mili
 Anand Kishore also said that there was no such instruction from the board that the number should be given less
 unhone kaha ki aage bhi yadi koi shikaayat aegi to board jaanch ke liye taiyaar he
 Click to see 'aaj Tak' sting upie sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal ke teen saal puure hone par aaj yojit bhoj main congress or samaajawaadee party ke bich bad rahi najdiki saaf taur par dikhi

 is par samaajawaadee party ne kaha he ki upie kii daavat main aavbhagat or sonia−manmohan ke saath mulaayam ke photo ke zyada myne na nikaale jaaen
 Samajwadi Party is still not behind in counting the flaws of the government
 upie sarkaar ke duusare bade dal trinmul congress ke sirf ek mantri saugat raay hi is aayojan main shaamil hue
 However, Congress spokesperson Renuka Chaudhary denied that Mulayam Singh and Lalu Yadav were tried to send a message to someone by sitting with senior ministers

 It is courtesy of Mulayam Singh Yadav to come here
 yah puche jane par ki kya ise varsh 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav se jod kar dekha jaae, unhone kaha, loktantr main kuch bhi sambhav he
 
 
 In a democracy, we only benefit from talking and not talking
 udhar, mulaayam ne bhi raashtrapati pad ke liye upie ke ummidavaar ko samarthan dene kii baat kah kar is najdiki ko or pukhta kiya, haalanki unhone upie sarkaar main shaamil hone ke sawaal kaa nakaaratmak jabaab diya
 On this, the Samajwadi Party has said that Mulayam's photos with hospitality and sonia-manmohan should not be taken away in the UPA feast
 samaajawaadee party sarkaar kii khamiyaan ginane main ab bhi peeche nahin he
 Only one minister Saugat Rai of Trinamool Congress, the other major party of UPA government, attended the event
 haalanki congress pravaktaa renuka choudhary ne is baat se inkaar kiya ki mulaayam singh or lalu yadav ko varisht mantriyon ke saath bithakar kisi ko koi sandesh dene kii koshish kii gai
 The comments renuka ne kaha, yah kisi ke liye koi sanket nahin he
 We respect everyone
 yah mulaayam singh yadav kaa shishtachar he ki vah yahaan aae
 Asked whether this should be linked to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, he said, anything is possible in a democracy
 
 
 loktantr main hamen sirf baat karne se phayda hota he or baat nahin karne se koi phayda nahin hota
 On the other hand, Mulayam also confirmed this closeness by saying he supported the UPA nominee for the presidency, although he gave a negative answer to the question of joining the UPA government

 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke somvaar ko die tivi intervyuu par bijepi netaa arun jetali ne karaara prahaar kiya he
 In his blog, Jaitley has openly spent on Rahul's first interview
 jetali ne intervyuu ke dauraan charchaa main rahe paanch muddon or us par rahul ke jawaab kaa khandan kiya he
 Jaitley has written a question on the blog, "what does Rahul Gandhi have to offer for the country?" Read what Jaitley has written on his blog
 
 
 1
 Why is there no PM candidate from Congress? Rahul Gandhi's answer to this question is unbelievable
 ham sabhi jaanate hai ki sattadhari dal ke empi ek netaa chunate hai jo pradhanmantri hota he
 We also know that declaring someone as PM candidate is neither unconstitutional nor outside the purview of the constitution
 yah duniyabar main hota he
 2
 system main badlaav or shashaktikarnaham ek sansadeey loktantr hai or yah bharat ke liye sabase acchhee pranali he
 What is the alternative system that Rahul is talking about? He says that he believes in democracy
 vah artiai or shakti ko janata ke haathon main dene main vishwaas rakhte hai
 This according to him is the difference between him and Narendra Modi
 lekin kya vaaki yah antar he
 In Indian politics, everyone has to believe in democracy, freedom and public empowerment
 to phir unhen khud ko yah pramaan patr dene kii kya jarurat he ki vah artiai or shashaktikaran main vishwaas rakhte hai
 The truth is that candidates are decided by a few people in the Congress party
 bijepi main block or jila str kii ikai rajya ikai ko ummidavaar kii sifarish karti he
 The state unit then puts those recommendations before the party's Central Election Committee
 iske baad charchaa or vimarsh ke baad hi ummidavaar kaa naam tay hota he
 Not only this, a large number of party leaders were also discussed for the party's post of PM, after which the most suitable candidate was declared
 jabaki isse ulat congress party main piem ummidavaar kaa chayan is aadhaar par hota he ki vah kis parivaar se aata he
 Had Rahul Gandhi been the leader of any other political party, he would have had to struggle to become a party official
 unhen congress party main badlaav ke bare main bolnaa chahie naa ki puure tantra main
 3
 bharat ke manufaccharing hub banane or china se tulanis maamle main upie sarkaar ne pichley 10 varshon main kya kiya he
 China's main capability is low-cost manufacturing
 log chini samaan kharidte hai, kyonki vah sasta he
 There is a need to simplify the interest rates in this sector with world class infrastructure to make the manufacturing sector competitive in India
 saath hi bijli, vyapaar suvidha, global taxeshan or shram ke kshetra main pratispardhi daron main lacheela rukh apnaane or twarit nirnay lene kii jarurat he
 Has the UPA government moved an inch even in these and other necessary reforms
 yakeenan iskaa uttar nahin he

 1984 or 2002 ke gujarat dangon main tulanavarsh 1984 main 31 oktober kii dopaher ames ke baahar ek naaraa shuru hua 'khun ke badale khun'
 This was the place where the body of Mrs
 Indira Gandhi was kept
 tab congress netaaon ko bheed kaa netritv karte dekha gaya
 Sikhs were killed in thousands of places
 inamen se kisi bhi jagah par police ne bheed hataane ke liye ek goli tak nahin chalaai
 These cases were not investigated
 jaanch ke liye ek samiti bani jo ek thagne vaali report lekar ai
 The victims have not yet received justice
 gujarat main hajaaron logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 The police opened fire at several places amid heavy pressures, killing around 300 rioters
 hajaaron mukademen darj hue, saikadon ko sajaa hui
 The Chief Minister of the state had to undergo several investigations, including the SIT constituted by the Supreme Court
 lekin unke khilaaf koi saboot nahin mili
 Where did Rahul Gandhi get the idea that the state had no involvement in the 1984 riots? 4
 bhrashtachar ke mudde parcongress party ne bihar main ek doshi qaraar die gaye netaa se gathjod kiya he
 There is no RJD without Lalu Prasad Yadav

 On the very first day of the election year 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has started his mission election by giving interviews
 news agency ANI ko die gaye dedh ghante ke intervyuu main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne har mudde par baat kii
 These included all the big issues including Ram temple, Rafael, CBI controversy
 modi ne is dauraan congress par bhi jamkar waar kiya or bataaya ki 2019 ke liye agenda kya hoga
 The Prime Minister responded in detail to all the 10 big questions which made headlines during the tenure of Modi government
 
 
 1
 There is something wrong with Rafael Deal? Answer of Prime Minister Narendra Modi - whatever allegations on Rafale are not personal on me, they are on the government
 agar mere upar koi aarope he to vah khojbin kar nikaal sakate hai
 i have spoken in detail on this issue in Parliament and the Assemblies
 supreme court ne bhi masalaa puraa clear kar diya he, court ne bal kii khaal nikaal di he
 The President of France and the Prime Minister of India have also responded, the person in front should prove the charge
 sirf pathar markar bhaagna nahin chahie
 2
 itane adhik videshi daure kyon?pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa jawaab –sabhi pradhanmantriyon kii itani hi yatra hoti hai, bahut se aise sammelan hote hai jinamein janaa jaruri hota he
 If someone below the Prime Minister's level goes, then the matter is suppressed
 meraa hisaab ye he ki agar ek desh jaataa hum to saath vaale bhi do-teen chalaa jaataa hum, isse samay-paisa donon bachataa he
 The Prime Minister who used to visit earlier did not notice anyone there, nor did he notice here
 3
 Surgical strike: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's answer - Political strike should not be politicized
 strike hone ke baad kisi mantri or pradhanmantri ne bayaan nahin diya tha
 Army officer gave information, we first told Pakistan and then told the country
 lekin usee din kuch netaaon ne shaq khadaa kiya he, jo pakistan bol rahaa tha vahi hamaare desh ke log bhi de rahe the
 You chanted for the army of the country, there was a rhetoric on the very first day
 unhone kaha ki sargical strike ke baad mere bheetar ek aakrosh tha, main baichaiyn tha
 4
 teen talaak bill-sabarimalapradhanmantri narendra modi kaa jawaab –adhiktar islamic deshon main teen talaak nahin he, yani ye dharm kaa hissaa nahin he
 This is just a matter of gender discrimination
 agar sabarimala kii baat kii jaae to desh main kuch mandir hai jahaan purush nahin jate yaa mahila nahin jaati hai
 Women judge should also be heard on the issue of Sabarimala
 5
 Constitutional institutions pressurize the government? Prime Minister Narendra Modi's answer - Congress does not have the right to speak in this matter, you (congress) made NSE against PMO
 cabinet ke nirnay ko party kaa netaa faad de, planning ke logon ko jokaron kaa banch kaha tha
 The dispute in CBI is a personal matter, we sent both of them on leave
 agar arabiai maamle kii baat karen to urjit patel ne khud apni marji se pad choda, 6 maheene se kah rahe the
 He did a fantastic job
 6
