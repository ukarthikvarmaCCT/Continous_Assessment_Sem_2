 We were not nervous but we were definitely under some pressure

 Kiran Nagarkar first met the main character of his latest novel Jasoda in the late nineties
 ve kehete hai, ''us samay mujhe is baat kaa leshmaatr bhi anumaan nahin tha ki main lagbhag 20 saal tak is mahila ke saath rahoonga
 "jasoda is her seventh novel to hit the market this month
 jaahir he ki kakald ke liye sahitya academy puraskaar jeet chuke nagarkar ke is upanyaas kii sahitya premiyon ko kaaphi pratiksha he
 This bilingual author of critical essays on plays, screenplays and films, theater and literature has often been compared with Dostoevsky and Graham Greene
 apni khaas style main ve kathatmak failaav ko behad tikhe vyangy, gahari anubhuti or vivaran kii gaharaai ke saath milakar pesh karte hai
 They talk about this main character, a tremendous woman, as if they were in the same room with her
 jis upanyaas main vah mahila jinda rahi, vah mahaj 250 pannon kaa he lekin uski katha bhukh kii tarah anant or lipsaa kii tarah nirmam he
 i asked, "did you know from the beginning that she would be a killer?" "" Of course ", he says
 upanyaas kii pehali hi ghatana, tisare prishth par ek hatya he
 Of a newborn girl
 lekin jasoda kii duniya main glani, shok yaa dukh ke liye koi vakt nahin he
 This murder, like other murders and crimes in the book, is just another incident, neither the worst nor the most important
 nagarkar kehete hai ki yah upanyaas do baton se upja he, ''pehali, yah vah desh he jisamen dher sari nadiyon ke baavjood khub sookhaa padataa he
 Men have a way: they commit suicide
 maataaon ke paas koi rasta nahih unhen akele sab kuch jhelana padataa he, apane bacchon ke saath
 Secondly, men force women to kill their children because they say who can raise a girl child for which they have to give dowry for endless time? And this woman — arguably brave, unique in every sense — still murders her own daughters
 "to jasoda villen he yaa sant? nagarkar kehete hai, yahi hamaari jindagiyon kii sabase badi paheli he
 He says, "I had absolutely no intention of writing this book
 " thik usee tarah se jaise unka kakald likhane kaa koi iraadaa nahin tha
 The story of Meerabai's husband Kakald was written against a 17th century backdrop
 ''main film festival ke liye dilli aayaa karata tha
 One winter night when i was riding a scooter and was stubborn, i did not know where i thought: there is this woman, probably one of the most famous women in India, but her husband as a blank in history is
 "teen saal baad, jab kakald kaa prakaashan ho rahaa tha, jasoda apni jagah bana rahi thi
 But she remained there
 phir ek dost ne us adhure chhod die gaye upanyaas ke pehle 70 pej pard liye or usne jor diya ki use puraa kiya jaae
 Actually such strange incidents have been the story of the entire literary life of Nagarkar
 1967 main ek din dilip chitre ne yah zikr kiya ki ve marathi patrika abhiruchi kaa sampadan karenge
 "I don't understand why and how, but that night i came home and sat at the table
" maine tab apni maatrubhaasha main apane jivan kii pehali laghukatha likhi
 "she soon got published
 agle din, ''bagaiyr ek pal soche, maine ''saat sakkam trechalisy likhnaa shuru kar diya

 In Bihar, the defeat of the candidates in the by-elections in five Lok Sabha and five assembly seats next month will be decided, the opposition grand alliance will stand the test
 is upachunaav ko agle varsh hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ke semifinal ke rup main bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 The five assembly seats in Bihar, for which the by-elections have been announced, were held by the Grand Alliance in the last assembly election
 inamen chaar siton par jad (you) ke ummidavaar, jabaki kishanganj seat par congress ke ummidavaar vijayi hue the
 At that time, JD (U) was in the grand alliance, but is now included in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA)
 aise main is chunaav main badale sameekaran main mahagathbandhan kii chunauti in siton par kabja banaae rakhane kii hogi
 Let me tell you, in the last assembly election the nature of the grand alliance was different
 us samay rajd, jad (you) or congress saath thi
 The JD (U) is now separated from the Grand Alliance and the Rashtriya Loksamata Party (RLSP) is with the Grand Alliance
 is saal hue loksabhaa chunaav main paanch vidhayakon ke saansad ban jane ke kaaran khaali hui bihar vidhansabha kii paanch siton par upachunaav hona he, jabaki lok janashakti party (lojpa) ke saansad ramchandra paswan ke nidhan se khaali hui samastipur sansadeey seat par bhi saath hi chunaav hona he
 The biggest challenge for the Grand Alliance is seat-sharing
 sabhi dalon ne apane-apane daawey kar siton par pech fansaa diya he
 RJD spokesperson Matyunjay Tiwari says, "the largest party in Bihar is the RJD
 varsh 2010 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main rajd chaar siton par duusare sthaan par rahi thi
 RJD candidates have also won these four seats multiple times
 aise main chaar siton par uskaa daawa banataa he
 Nevertheless, all the leaders of the Grand Alliance will sit together and distribute seats
 'idhar, congress ne bhi upachunaav ko lekar do siton par daawa kiya he
 Congress Legislative Councilor Premchandra Mishra said that Kishanganj Assembly and Samastipur Lok Sabha seats are his traditional seats
 shesh siton par mahagathbandhan kii ore se jeetne vaale ummidavaar ko hi tikat diya jaae, aisi koshish rahegi
 Here, Jeetan Ram Manjhi, chief of Hindustani Awam Morcha (WE), has also claimed a seat
 maanjhi ne somvaar ko kaha tha, "nathanagar seat par hamaari taiyaari shuru ho gai he
 Discussions have also been held with the RLSP and the leaders of the Vikas Insan Party (VIP) involved in the Grand Alliance regarding this seat
 " maanjhi haalanki yah bhi kehete hai ki seat bantwaare ko lekar 24 sitambar ko mahagathbandhan kii baithak hogi
 Meanwhile, the RLSP and the vips have not opened their cards yet, but after these statements, it is certain that seat-sharing among the constituents of the grand alliance is not so easy
 mahagathbandhan ke ek netaa kii maane to samastipur loksabhaa seat congress ke khate main janaa lagbhag tay he or darunda va belahar seat par rajd kii daavedaari par baat banati dikh rahi he
 Nathnagar and Simri Bakhtiarpur are two seats on which it will not be easy to sort out the trapped screws after the claim of many parties
 kishanangaj vidhansabha seat par congress kii daavedaari banati he
 However, before going to the by-election, the Grand Alliance constituents will also have to fight for seat sharing and then unite and challenge the election result in their favor under the changed equation

 gurugram ke reyaan international skool main hue pradhyumna murder cese main sibiai kii report se ek nayaa mode aa gaya he
 Contrary to police theory, the CBI has said that an 11th student of the school has murdered Pradyuman
 sibiai kii report par santosh jataate hue pradhyumna ke pita varun thakur ne maang kii he ki is maamle main juthi kahani gadhane vaale or lipapoti karne vaale skool prashasan or police prashasan ke sabhi logon par karrwai honi chahie
 His lawyer Sushil Tekriwal, who came to press conference with Pradyuman's father, said that the case should be heard quickly
 saath hi unhone maang kii, 'aaropee chaatr ko vayask mana jaae or use faansee kii sajaa di jaae
 Describing the school administration as more responsible, he demanded an in-depth inquiry into his role
 saath hi unhone ye bhi kaha ki is baat kaa pataa lagaaya jaae ki ashok ko kisne khadaa kiya, saboot kyon or kaise mitaae gaye
 The CBI investigating the case has detained a student of class 11 (16)
 is maamle main chaatr se hiraasat main poochtacha kii ja rahi he
 CBI sources say that the accused student has carried out the incident due to exams and PTM
 is chaatr ko teen din kii sibiai remand par rakhaa gaya he
 CBI sources say that the accused student wanted to postpone the school examination and parent-teacher meeting
 isliye usne is vaardaat ko anjaam diya he
 Many scientific evidence has also been found during the investigation in connection with this incident
 sisitivi footage main bhi aaropee dikhaa he
 The CBI produced him in the juvenile court on Wednesday
 pradhyumna ke pita varun thakur or unke vakil ne buudhvaar ko ek press conference main skool or haryana police prashasan par sawaal uthaaya
 Pradyuman's father Varun Thakur said, "somewhere the CBI has said that that could be a possible reason
 baccha padhai main kamjor tha, use jis tarah ke saamaajik dabaav kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha, uski vajah se vah aisa kar saktaa he
 Apart from this, the child has been in skull for a long time, he knew about the flaws in the school premises, so he chose that site
 police ne pehle jis tarah kii theory chuni thi, us par kisi ko bharosa nahin ho rahaa tha
 There was doubt in the minds of the people that Kipulis is anything other than a story
 yah baat ab sabit ho gai he
 We want the CBI to investigate the matter further and all the accused should come forward and have a charge frame against them, so that a positive message will be sent that such an incident will not happen and there is a fear among the criminals that they will not be safe
 Can
 'doshiyon ko faansee hovarun thakur ke vakil susheel tekdiwaal ne kaha, 'is maamle main lipapoti karne kaa puraa prayaas kiya gaya
 Such changes were made at the scene as if no crime had taken place there
 yah kiske dabaav par kiya gaya? police kisko bachaana chaahati thi? sibiai ko aise sabhi logon ko salaakhon ke peeche laana chahie
 "he said," according to the CBI, an 11th class child committed the murder
 vah chahta tha ki exam tal jaaevah ausat student tha

 The entire country is shocked by the major terrorist attack on Sunday in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir

 The whole country is in shock after this incident
 bollywood industry bhi is hamail kaa twit kar or bayaan dekar jamkar virodh kar rahi he
 But recently the statement made by filmmaker Sajid Khan on this attack is really embarrassing
 Business of cinema kii khabar ke mutabik, haal hi main ek buklaunchake maukey par jab sajid khan se uri aatanki ke bare main ek patrkaar ne sawaal poocha to, sajid ne kaha ki is bare main baat karne ke liye yah sahi manch nahin he
 Sajid said, 'it is very sad and angry with what happened but it is not the right platform to talk about it, we have come here to talk about a book launch, it will be good we talk about it
 'vaisesajidaka yah bayaan vaaki sharmnaak he, sajid ko desh ke liye apni jaan ganvaane vaale sainikon ke bare main chand shabd bolne main ek sahi plateform chahie? agar vah ek book launch event ke maukey par chand shabd desh ke jaanbaaj shahidon par bol bhi dete to kya fark padataa
 a question to Sajid is that can an event be more important than speaking a few words on martyrdom of martyrs? Well, the answer can be found with Bollywood mega star Amitabh Bachchan and many such celebs who recently paid tribute to the martyred soldiers through their gifts, condemning the Uri attack during their events
 It is a sad news

 Long before the words 'search for food' and 'very local' became prevalent, we have been alive only by eating naturally grown food around or, say, growing
 hajaaron varshon ke antaraal main ham yah jaan paae ki kya hamen tandoorust rakhega or bimariyon se bachaayegaa
 However, in the last few decades, we have forgotten this aspect from our collective consciousness

 The basic flaw in the understanding of this 'farm to dinner table' and its implementation in some of the best restaurants in the world is that the chefs are in the role of the operator

 This is the biggest irony of modern food after industrial civilization

 We quickly realized that in order to connect our local cuisine to the local, regional food philosophy or system, we have to present something different 'luxury of food (luxury)' and without any frills or in any way Local seasonal vegetables have to be popularized without changing
 is koshish main hamane pichley chaar saal main apane menu main kareeb 140 kism kii desi, mausami subjiyon ko shaamil kiya he
 However, we were still isolated from those who grow our food
 yah is saal ke shuru main hamaare 'test of wild' abhiyaan se badla
 Together with ooforms, we developed a menu of naturally grown vegetables, which were very tasty, but were not altered in any way
 yah kuch dussahas jaisaa tha kyonki koi parichit tarika nahin tha ki in subjiyon ko kaise pakaaya jaae or inamen zyaadaatar thode samay ke liye hi milti hai, kuch to pakhwaade bhar ke liye
 So we went to the growing villages and learned how to make them
 haalanki is dilachasp safar kaa sabase khaas nateeja yah ehsaas tha ki hamen uske prati bhi samvedansheel hona chahie jahaan se hamaari bhojan samagriyaan milti hai
 So instead of asking for special vegetables for our wild food menu, we asked the local communities where they grow in abundance and also took care that the forests should not be ruined or impacted on their own food for our menu
 shef or restaraan kii aaj ek javabdehi he
 It may be in their own interest that their specialty is determined on the basis of how their initiative has been in preserving heritage and cuisine
 yah bhi jaahir he ki ham aise daur main pahunch rahe hai ki jaagruk hone ke alaava koi chaara nahin he, to ham isaki shuruyaat aaj hi kyon na karen
 Luxury or shano-shaukat will never be hungry
 isliye, ham agar sampurna samaaj bananaa chaahate hai to hamen dobaaraa sochna, dobaaraa bananaa or dobaaraa samajhnaa hoga ki shaano-shaukat yahi he ki ham dharohar or parampara se zyada jude rahen
 And that future will be one which is both legitimate and accountable

 gandhi parivaar kii ek or netaa priyanka gandhi wadra kii aadhikarik taur par raajnneeti main entry ho gai he
 He has been given the command of Eastern Uttar Pradesh for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections along with making him the General Secretary of the Congress
 uttar pradesh main pichley teen dashak se congress kii sthiti kharaab rahi he
 Now after Priyanka took charge, it has started to speculate among the political pundits that how much Congress will be able to perform miracles in Uttar Pradesh with the help of Priyanka
 is sawaal kaa jawaab to aane vaale kuch maheenon main milegaa, lekin yahaan yah dekhnaa munasib rahegaa ki kya pehle jab kabhi gandhi parivaar se kisi ke chunaav main utarane se congress ke pradarshan main kuch badlaav hue hai
 In the Lok Sabha elections from 1989 to 2014, which party got how many seats in UP, since the 1989 elections, the performance of the Congress is downhill in Uttar Pradesh and in the 1998 elections, the Congress account in Uttar Pradesh was not even opened
 haalanki, 1977 ke chunaav main bhi congress uttar pradesh jaise bade rajya main khaataa nahin khol pai thi, baavjood iske congress kaa vot 25 fisadi tha
 It finished second in all 85 seats in the state, but in the 1998 election, the Congress had got only 6 percent of the votes and the Congress candidate's bail was forfeited in 69 seats
 iske ek saal baad hi 1999 ke loksabhaa chunaav main pichley chunaav ke mukaable congress ke pradarshan main kaaphi sudhaar hua
 The party not only managed to win 10 seats but also increased its vote by almost 9 percent
 ab sawaal uthta he ki 1999 ke chunaav main aisa kya hua ki dhalaan kii ore ja rahi congress ne vaapasi kar lee
 There can be many different analyzes of this, but one big thing was the big change in the election politics of Uttar Pradesh
 darasal, 1999 main congress kii tatkaaleen adhyaksh sonia gandhi amethi seat se chunaav ladiin or saansad bani thim
 This is the year when Priyanka first came to the Congress to campaign in Amethi and Rae Bareli
 is chunaav main congress ne amethi or raibareli kii seat bijepi se chin lee, jis par abhi tak congress kaa kabja he
 The same situation is once again in Uttar Pradesh for Priyanka Gandhi and Congress
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi congress na sirf 2 siton par simat gai balki uskaa vot girakar 8 fisadi par aa gaya he
 Now Priyanka has been given the command of eastern Uttar Pradesh besides Amethi and Rae Bareli
 ab sawaal yah he ki kya 2019 main priyanka kaa jalawaa amethi or raibareli se aage bad paaegaa? kya priyanka, modi or yogi sarkaar ko chunauti de paaengi?1989 se lekar 1998 tak lagaataar congress ke vot main giravat aa rahi thi, jabaki iske viparit bijepi ke vot main chunaav dar chunaav ijapha ho rahaa tha
 This trend changed in the 1999 Lok Sabha elections
 jahaan congress ke vot pratishat main ijapha hua, to bijepi ke vot main 8 pratishat kaa nuksaan hua
 This trend continued in the subsequent elections as well
 2014 ke chunaav main congress ke vot main 10 fisadi kii giravat darj kii gai to duusari ore bijepi ke vot main 25 fisadi kii apratyaashit badhotaree hui
 That is, if the Congress decreases in UP, then the BJP will increase or if the BJP decreases, then the Congress will increase
 2019 ke chunaav main bijepi ke liye badhat ko kaayam rakhana mushkil he
 a large part of the decline in its vote bank may come towards the Congress
 agar congress, bijepi ke 5 fisadi vot ko apane paale main laane main kaamyaab ho jaati he to uskaa khaasaa nuksaan bijepi ko uthaanaa padegaa
 Because this time SP and BSP are together
 aise main agar bijepi ko nuksaan hota he to iskaa asar siton par padegaa or bijepi badi party hone ke baavjood zyada siten nahin nikaal paaegi

 Akshay took the victim's case lightly and instead of taking him to the doctor, gave him some abortion pills to eat
 peedita ne akshay par bharosa kiya or yah sochakar aborshan pills kha leen ki uski pregnancy khatm ho jaaegi
 After which the victim returned to her home in Dubai

 In Maharashtra, it seems that the Shiv Sena is now out on revenge by electing from the BJP
 tabhi party ke varisht netaa sanjay raut ne apane twitor par ek aisa cortoon share kiya he jisamenek baagh (shivasena kaa party chihn) ghadi vaala ek locket (ensipi kaa chihn) apane gale main pahane hue he, uske ek 'panje' main camel kaa phool (bijepi kaa chihn) darasal saal 2014 main shivasena ko bijepi ne jhidak diya tha or akele chunaav ladakar apni sarkaar bhi bana lee thi
 The BJP was riding the Modi wave at that time and the BJP, which once worked as an ally in the Shiv Sena government in the state, now came in the role of an elder brother
 shivasena us samay apane bure daur main pahunch gai thi
 In this election, BJP got 122 Shiv Sena 63 seats and Congress 42 and NCP 41 seats
 bijepi ne ensipi se samarthan lekar sarkaar bana lee
 Although it was repeatedly said by the Shiv Sena that it is ready to support the BJP by forgetting everything, but the BJP completely ignored the Shiv Sena at that time
 vyang chitrakarachi kamaal! Don't mind it's Diwali

 # maharashtraassemblypollspic
 twitter
 com / 2weflihtb1 However, later the equation changed in the state and Shiv Sena also joined BJP government
 lekin maharashtra sarkaar ke kisi bhi bade mantralay main shivasena netaaon ko jagah nahin di gai
 By the time the 2019 Lok Sabha elections were announced, the Shiv Sena came into the role of an absolute opposition
 haalanki baad main bijepi ne shivasena ko manaa liya or donon ne milakar loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladaa or jeeta bhi
 But then the BJP got so many seats in the Lok Sabha that it did not need the support of its allies and as a result, the Shiv Sena again did not find a place in the Union Cabinet according to its mind, the same thing happened with JDU
 shivasena andar hi andar man masos kar rah gai or uddhav thakare sirf bayanon tak hi simit rah gaye
 But this time Shiv Sena has already expressed its desire to take down Aditya Thackeray
 party aditya thakare ko mukhyamantri ke rup main dekhnaa chaahati he
 Some results have also come that the BJP cannot form a government without any cooperation
 pichhali baar jahaan bhaajapa kii 122 siten thi vahiin is baar uske khate main sirf 105 siten ai hai
 The number of seats of Shiv Sena has also come down from 56 to 56 from last time but its role is going to be important for the stability of NDA government
 vahiin, congress kii baat karen ise 44 siten mili hai
 Sharad Pawar-led NCP has got 54 seats this time, which is 13 seats more than in 2014 and now the buzz is that if Shiv Sena talk with BJP does not happen and congress-ncp supports it then The figure reaches 154
 yah aankada bahumat se 9 zyada hoga
 However, the coming together of Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP seems far-fetched
 kyon ki yah faisla shivasena ke liye vaicharik samjhauta hoga
 At present, the Shiv Sena is trying its best to take the BJP under pressure by discussing another option and implement an old 1995 formula
 iske mutabik dhai saal shivasena sarkaar chalaae or dhai saal bijepi
 But the BJP wants that it should hold the post of Chief Minister for the entire five years and it can agree to give the deputy CM post to Shiv Sena
 yahaan ek baar gaur karne vaali yah he ki 50-50 kaa formula 1999 main bijepi netaa gopinath munde ne diya tha jis par shivasena us samay raji nahin hui thi or abaki baar bijepi ke saamne yahi sawaal he

 Deepika's statement suggests that she is not educated
 unhen phir se padhai shuru kar kuch siikhnaa chahie
 It is unfortunate that the country is being described as backward only on the basis of cinema
 hamen ye bhi nahin pataa ki deepika bharat kii naagarik hai bhi yaa nahin
 Deepika's statement should be criticized across the country
 aise bayaan dekar wo bollywood ke standard ko bhi neeche le ja rahi hai
 'padmavati's story must be told: On the protests and banning demands of politicians in the country regarding Deepikapadmavati kirillies, Deepika said,' As a woman, i am a part of this film and make this story known to the world
 i am very proud to tell
 ye ek aisi kahani he jise jarur bataaya janaa chahie
 'nobody can stop the release of the film: Deepikadipika also asked,' Where have we reached as a nation? It is scary, it is very scary, we are going backwards instead of moving forward
 hamaari agar kisi ko javabdehi he to vah sirf sensor board ko he, main jaanati hum or mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki is film ko relies hone se koi nahin roak saktaa

 It is reported that Shivpal Yadav, a former state president who was marginalized in the Samajwadi Party, is also preparing to go to the NDA
 shivpal ke paas iske do vikalp hai jisapar wo karibiyon ke saath charchaa kar rahe hai
 Significantly, Shivpal Yadav, who was part of the top leadership of the Samajwadi Party, was marginalized by his nephew and the then Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav just before the election
 naubat ye aa gai ki shivpal kaa vidhansabha chunaav jeetne bhi mushkil lag rahaa tha
 Soon after the election, Shivpal had indicated that he would soon form a new party in which sp's mentor Mulayam Singh Yadav would be made the president

 Shivpal also discussed these two options together with Mulayam Singh Yadav in Delhi

 While stating this phrase, its CM said that if it does not mean anything else, then there will be a quarrel among themselves
 jab fadanvis ne sharad pavaar se lee thi salaahkaaryakram memfadenvisane kaha ki sahi myne main dildaar shabd sharad pavaar ke liye hi he, isamen koi jhooth baat nahin he
 CM Fadnavis said that he had consulted Pawar while waiving the loans of farmers
 mukhyamantri ne ye bhi kaha ki sharad pavaar kaa bhi maananaa he, karj maafee upaay nahin he, lekin vakt kii jarurat he
 Sharad gave the minister of the prosperity of farmers, Sharad Pawar accepted, CM Fadnavis had consulted him before announcing debt waiver
 sharad pavaar ne kaha, 'maine akhabaaron main padhaa ki yavatmal main hui ghatana ke baad CM ne dawaai companiyon ke khilaaf maamla darj karne kaa aadesh diya he
 It is true that such action should be taken
 lekin kisaanon kii fasal kaa utpaadan badhanaa he, to nae bijon kaa virodh karnaa galat he

 sawan kaa maheenaa shuru ho chukaa he
 According to religious beliefs, this month is very sacred and dedicated to Lord Shiva
 aise main bholebaba kaa har bhakt unhen prasann karke apni sabhi ichchhaaon ko puraa kar lenaa chahta he
 In this special month, lakhs of devotees come from far and wide to join the Kanvad Yatra
 kanvad yatra main shaamil hone vaale shraddhalu apni kanvad main gangaajal bharkar shiv kaa jalabhishek karne ke liye prasthaan karte hai
 The special significance of Lord Shankar's Jalabhisheka in the month of Sawan is stated
 manyata he ki jalabhishek karne se bhagwaan shiv apane bhakton par jald prasann hokar unki sabhi muraadein jaldi puri karte hai
 But do you know some special rules have also been told for the devotees traveling to Kawad
 agar inkaa paalan na kiya gaya to bhagwaan shiv naaraaz ho sakate hai
 Rules related to Kavad Yatra - Before offering Ganga water to Lord Shiva, no Kavad should be kept on the ground
 iske peeche yah manyata he ki jalstrot ko sidhaa prabhu se joda gaya he
 Like the continuous journey of every Kavad, the grace of the Lord should remain naturally on him
 - kanvad yatra ke dauraan jal bharne ke liye upyog kiya jane vaala jal kaa paatr kahin se tutaa-phuta yaa pehle se upyog kiya hua nahin hona chahie
 -the character preferred for Gangajal should be tied with a rope of silk or cotton during the journey of Kaanvad
 usamen lagane vaali lakdi yaa danda bhi saaf va doshamukt hona chahie
 - During this journey to get the blessings of Lord Shiva, do not give your vessel to anyone else
 -kanvad yatra ke dauraan har bhakt ko vrath rakhana chahie or apni yatra samooh main hi kerani chahie
 - Devotees should travel to Kanwar for two hours before sunrise and two hours after sunset
 -har kaanvdie ko apni puri yatra ke dauraan bhagwaan shiv ke kisi bhi mantra kaa jap yaa bhajan kaa samaran karte hue apni yatra kerani chahie
 - If a person wants to get rid of child happiness, mental happiness, psychiatric relief and financial problem, then Kandar Yatra is very beneficial for him
 -kanvad yatra ke dauraan jal bharne ke liye kisi dhaatu ke paatr kaa upyog karen
 By doing this, purity will be maintained
 mitti ke paatr bhi jal sangrah main grahya hai
 But do not forget to use plastic, glass, aluminum, steel vessels to fill water

 party netaaon ko abi form baantate uddhav thakare (photo-india today)aurangabad pashchim se maujuuda vidhayak sanjay shirasat, kolhapur north se rajesh kshirsagar, sawantvadi se deepak kesarkar, cagal se sanjay ghadge, chandgarh se sangram kupekar, karvir se chandradeep narke, hathkanangale se sujith minchekar, shahubadi se sathyajith patil, radhanagari se prakaash abitkar or shirul se ulhas patil ko abi form jari kiye gaye hai
 a clear message to the BJP? The giving of the AB form means that the party has, in a way, officially stated that it has decided its candidates on the assembly seat and the seat sharing will not make much difference
 dopalo vidhansabha seat se mantri ramdaas kadam ke bete yogesh kadam ko abi form jari kiye gaye hai
 Luanda, the capital of Angola, is the most expensive city for corporate expatriates
 yah baat ek adhyayan main saamne ai he
 It includes three cities in Africa for the first time in the first ten cities

 vivaah kanoonon ko mahilaon ke or adhik anukool banane ke uddeshy se mantriyon kaa ek samooh jald hi is baat kaa faisla karegaa ki un maamalon main jahaan shaadi ko bachaa paanaa asambhav ho gaya ho, kya unamem talaak ke maamle main adaalat pati kii paitruk sampatti se mahila ke liye paryaapt muaavja tay kar sakati he
 The Group of Ministers was recently formed to decide on the Marriage Laws (amendment) Bill
 mantri samooh yah bhi tay karegaa ki agar aapasi sahmati se talaak ke liye pati-patni main se koi ek vyakti agar doosraa ‘sanyukt aavedan’ daakhil na kare, to kya court talaak dene main apane vivek kaa upyog kar saktaa he
 On the other hand, there are conflicting views about this proposal within the government itself
 sutron ne bataaya ki ek varg kii raay main, agar adaalat ko vivek kaa upyog karne kaa adhikaar de diya jaae to aapasi sahmati se talaak kaa uddeshy puraa nahin hoga
 He said that if one of the spouses refuses to file a joint application, the other should be allowed to apply for divorce on other grounds instead of mutual consent
 vidheyak main pati dwaara arjeet kii gai sampatti main se patni ko hissaa dene kaa praavdhaan he
 The Group of Ministers constituted under Defense Minister AK Antony is discussing a new clause 13F
 is nae praavdhaan main kaha gaya he ki agar paitruk sampatti banti nahin ja sakati, to isamen pati ke hisse kaa akalan kar patni ko paryaapt muaavja diya janaa chahie
 The amount of compensation can be decided by the court where the divorce case is heard
 pichley saptaah sampann pehali baithak main mantrisamooh ne aapasi sahmati se talaak kii khatir sanyukt aavedan dene ke icchhuk danpati ke liye chah maah tak intjaar karne kii anivaaryta nahin rakhane par faisle kaa jimmaa adaalat ko dene ke mudde par bhi charchaa kii
 Sources said there is a general consensus on the issue as it will expedite the divorce process
 intjaar kii avadhi pehle hi chah maah se 18 maah rakhi gai he or mantrisamooh ab is par vichaar karegaa ki kya nyaayadhish is avadhi ko chah maah se kam kar saktaa he
 a Supreme Court decision is being cited in support of this provision
 vidheyak main talaak ke baad pati kii sampatti main patni ke adhikaar sambandhi upbandh ko lekar pichley maah kendriya mantrimandal main matbhed ubhar aae the or yah maamla mantrisamooh ko saunpna padaa
 After introducing the Bill in Rajya Sabha, it has been placed before the Cabinet thrice with different changes
 vidheyak ab bhi rajyasabha main lambit he
 The amendment bill seeking changes in the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 and the Special Marriage Act 1954 introduced the option of divorce on the grounds that 'marriage is not possible to save'

 He said, "I don't know why party supremo Mayawati is angry with me

 i will remain in politics, but have not decided which party to join

 As soon as the 2019 Lok Sabha elections reached Delhi and Punjab, once again the case of 1984 Sikh riots came to the center
 congress netaa sam pitroda ne is masale par kuch aisa kah diya ki bhartiya janata party ko congress ke khilaaf morcha kholane kaa mauka mil gaya
 When Sam Pitroda was attacking the BJP, he said on the 1984 issue that it happened in '84
 
 'BJP has objected to this
 bijepi aaj dilli main sam pitroda ke khilaaf pradarshan bhi kar rahi he
 What did Sam Pitroda say? Actually, while attacking the Narendra Modi government at the Center, Congress leader Sam Pitroda said that you keep on lying constantly, first lied on us yesterday

 What did you do in five years, what happened in '84
 
 what did you do
 sam pitroda congress kii overseas unit ke pramukh hai or gandhi parivaar ke kareebi rahe hai
 However, Sam Pitroda later accused the BJP of misrepresenting some words of his statement
 Agony of the entire Sikh community
 Suffering of all those Sikh families killed by Congress leaders in 1984
 Attack on Delhi’s secular ethos
 All Summed up in these three words by Sam Pitroda - Hua To Hua

 org / projects / rahat-floods-kerala congress ke us kaddavar netaa kaa 21 july ko janmdin he, jo kabhi sangh or bijepi kaa bada cheharaa tha
 Yes, we are talking about Shankarsingh Vaghela
 gujarat congress ke vipaksh ke netaa shankarasingh waghela is baat ko lekar arase se surkhiyon main he ki vah congress main rahenge yaa bijepi main laut jaaenge
 Vaghela himself has given vent to the speculation by saying that he is in Congress today, what is the address of tomorrow
 'shankarasingh wagheladilli aae to mana gaya ki yah congress se unke samjhaute kaa aakhri mauka tha
 After all the research, till date it has been known that he will not be going to meet Rahul or Sonia Gandhi, but will meet Ahmed Patel, political advisor of Sonia Gandhi at 2 pm
 media kii timen ahamed patel ke ghar ke baahar khadi raheen, lekin waghela nahin aae
 Vaghela spoke to the media at Gujarat Bhavan and said that he had come to Delhi for some personal work and was now going back to Ahmedabad
 unhone saaf kiya ki vah na rahul se milane vaale hai or naa sonia gandhi se
 Here, he did not even name Ahmed Patel
 kul milakar baat sidhi he ki waghela or congress ke bich maahaul thik nahin he
 Congress sources say that the party even offered Vaghela to the chief minister's chair
 haalanki aitidisi ke chairman rahete hue waghela par bhrashtachar ke aaropon ne'gujarat ke baapu'ko baikfoot par laa diya he
 Perhaps that's why he wants to leave the Congress under compulsion
 congress se jude sutara yah bhi kehete hai ki sibiai ke dabaav main waghela agar party chhodte bhi hai to hamaari ummid yahi he ki vah na to nai party banaaenge or na bijepi ke saath jaaenge
 Although 76-year-old Vaghela's close associates say that he may declare his retirement from politics by citing his age, but by sending his son to BJP, he will save himself from the CBI and get out of the Congress
 dilli aae waghela ne har sawaal ke jawaab main sirf itnaa kaha ki vah vyaktigat kaarnon se dilli aae hai or agar koi faisla sunaanaa he ki vah janmdin ke din sunaayenge
 However, Vaghela's not even meeting Ahmed Patel suggests that the matter is wrong
 aise main waghela ke janmdin kaarykram main chand ghante bache hai, is dauraan waghela or congress ke bich koi sahmati ban gai to thik, varanaa aap kah sakate hai ki 'gujarat kaa baapu' congress ke liye hanikaarak hone vaala he

 Explain that in response to Team India's 337 runs, New Zealand had scored 331 runs for seven wickets, but on the last occasion, the situation became very tense and the Kiwi team missed the match and series by 6 runs

 On the last occasion i decided to leave the responsibility to the bowlers so that they bowled as they wanted and that was the reason why i remained calm
 captain kohli bole, ‘match ke dauraan duusari pari main os bhi thi or khushi he ki ladke team ko jeet dilaane main safal rahe
 The wicket was easy and the ball was coming to the bat well
 isliye mujhe lagata he ki hamane 25 ran kam banaae
 Happily because the bowlers performed well at the right time
 kohli ke kaha, ‘yah hamaare liye nakout match jaisaa tha aurkhiladiyonne jajba dikhaaya
 Captain Kohli scored his 32nd century in this match and meanwhile he also became the fastest batsman to complete 9000 runs in odis
 bhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘meraa lakshya team ke liye match or siries jeetna hota he or agar main nijee taur par acha pradarshan karata hum to yah bonus hota he
 These records are difficult to ignore because we keep hearing about them but our goal is to win the team in any situation

 Low eye was seen in this video

 Priya also has a lip lock scene with her in the film
 priyanka gandhi kaa modi sarkaar par warberogari ke masale par centre ko gherinfosis main chantni kii khabar kaa diya hawalakongress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi wadra ne ek baar phir modi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Priyanka tweeted on the issue of unemployment on Wednesday morning and wrote that speaking only in foreign countries does nothing
 changa si bolne vaale ekadam chup kyon? congress netaa ne infosis main ho rahi chantni kii khabar ko aadhaar banaate hue pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 The Congress general secretary wrote in his tweet, 'going abroad, saying everything is fine, it will not be all right
 kahin se bhi rojgaar badhane, nae rojgaar paidaa hone kii khabar nahin aa rahi
 Renowned companies have started evacuating people
 changa si bolne vaale hai ekadam chup si
 Why? "actually, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had addressed a meeting in Houston with Donald Trump during his visit to America, then PM Modi said that everything is healed in India! Naqvi said - Priyanka Gandhi did not get the ground reality Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi retorted, saying that Priyanka Gandhi's knowledge is incomplete, she has no knowledge of the ground reality
 nakvi ne kaha ki priyanka ko jo bataa diya jaataa he, wo kah detii hai
 Mukhtar Abbas Fake said that i want to say so much to Priyanka Gandhi that she should also remember her ten-year reign
 jab inaki sarkaar kii nitiyo ke kaaran khaadya vasteen bazaar se gaayab ho jaati thim or log sadakon par pradarshan karte the
 Let me tell you that the news came in the past that the country's IT company Infosys is preparing for mass layoffs
 company kii ore se un logon par ye gaaj gir sakati he, jinaki selary kaaphi zyada he
 Accordingly, there may be a fall on 2200 employees of JL6 level
 gauratlab he ki congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi wadra lagaataar twit ke jariye modi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadh rahi hai
 Earlier too, he targeted the central government on the issue of unemployment
 kyon nishane par he modi sarkaar?rojgaar or arthvyavastha ke morche par centre sarkaar ko beete dinon main buree khabar hi mili he, phir chaahe GDP kaa girnaa ho, kor sector kii growth kaa neeche aana ho
 Not only Infosys, there were reports of layoffs from other big companies of the country, sector too
 ek taraf priyanka gandhi soshal media ke jariye centre sarkaar ko aade haathon le rahi he, to vahiin duusari ore congress party vipakshi partiyon ko saath lekar sarkaar ko gherne kii taiyaari main he
 The Congress will hold a nationwide demonstration on the issue of economy and employment, in which spokespersons in many parts of the country will hold press conferences against the government
 kendriya mantri smriti irani somvaar ko gujarat main baadh peediton ke bich pahunchi
 During this time, he not only talked to the flood affected people and got to know their condition, but also reviewed the relief and rescue gujarat main baadh se sabase zyada banaaskantha prabhavit hua he
 So far, more than 60 people have been reported dead
 jabaki saikadon kii taadaad main log beghar ho gaye hai
 After which Union Minister Smriti Irani reached flood affected areas of Banaskantha
 is dauraan wo naav main baithkar baadh ke kahar kaa jayja lene pahunchi
 The Union Minister said that so far 90 relief camps have been set up for the flood affected people
 kul 60 hajaar logon tak prashasan ne madad pahunchaai he
 He said that more than 20 lakh food packets have been distributed
 ek din ke daure par gujarat pahunchi smriti irani ne yahaan khaaraa gaanv main halaat kaa jayja liya
 This is the village, which was completely cut off from normal life in the last seven days
 banaas nadi main tej bahaav or jalastr bad jane se khaaraa ko aasapaas ke gaanvon se jodne vaala hive pani main dub gaya tha
 Smriti Irani reached the village with the NDRF team and sat in the boat to assess the devastation of the flood
 sthaneey logon ke mutabik, khaaraa gaanv se ab tak 10 logon ke shav praapt kiye ja chuke hai
 Although the rain has stopped in the area now
 jiske baad ab punarvaas or raahat pahunchane kaa kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 The Union Minister praised the Government of Gujarat
 saath hi unhone andiaref or duusari rescue team ke kaam kii bhi saraahna kii
 His supporters are continuously creating a ruckus after Dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim was convicted for raping Sadhvi
 ram rahim ke samarthakon ne kai jagah aag laga di he or todphod kii he
 The central government has reprimanded the Khattar government amidst furore in Haryana
 grahamantri rajnath singh ne mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ko poocha he ki jab centre sarkaar kii ore se force bheji gai thi to phir har jagah pulisavaale kyon tainaat kiye gaye
 The Home Minister has asked for the report of each district
 ram rahim ke samarthak sirf haryana or punjab main hi nahin balki dilli or haryana main bhi hangaamaa kar rahe hai
 The situation in all four states is becoming uncontrollable
 aise main sabase bada sawaal haryana kii sarkaar par uthta he, aakhir is tarah ke hangaame se nipatane taiyaari kyon nahin kii gai thi
 Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar appealed to the people for peace before the court's verdict
 or bharosa diya tha ki unhone har tarah kii sthiti se nipatane ke liye taiyaari kii he
 But even then, this kind of violence raises 5 big questions
 1
 Do not you prepare to do the work on the orders of the High Court? The High Court had given instructions to the state government before the decision that it should make thorough preparations for such a situation
 sarkaar ne is baat kii baat bhi kahi thi, lekin maujuuda haal sabake saamne he
 2
 dhara 144 hone ke baavjood kaise jamaa hue itane saare log?khatter sarkaar or rajya ke dijipi lagaataar kah rahe the ki puure ilaake main dhara 144 lagu kii gai he
 But still so many people submitted, which questions the government's own claim
 agar sarkaar sahi tareeke ise dhara 144 ko lagu karti to shaayad is tarah kii sthiti nahin paidaa hoti
 3
 kya rampal or jat andolan se koi sabak nahin le pai sarkaar?yah pehali baar nahin he ki haryana main is prakaar kaa updrav ho rahaa ho
 Even before this, the supporters of Baba Rampal have done this kind of orgy
 rampal ke samarthakon ne hisar main apana aatank machaaya tha
 Apart from this, during the Haryana movement last year, the situation in the state was extreme
 kai dinon tak rajya main chizein thap ho gai thi
 4
 maamle main dikhaai susti?jab tak ram rahim court main pesh nahin hue the, tab tak sarkaar sirf logon se apil hi kar rahi thi
 Statements were coming from the government that we want the supporters to maintain peace
 agar sarkaar apil ke saath-saath kuch kathor kadam bhi uthaati to ye sthiti paidaa naa hoti
 5
 samarthakon ko bhi di dheel?gurmeet ram rahim jab apane ashram se panchakula court kii ore ravaanaa hue, tab kaha ja rahaa tha ki vah lagbhag 800 gaadiyaan unke kafile main maujuud thi
 The presence of an accused in court with such convoys raises many questions on the looseness of the police and the state

 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle vidhansabha chunaav karaae jane se unhen khaasi mehnat nahin kerani padegi or apni chhavi kaa rajyastareey chunaav main phayda uthaa sakenge
 Staying till April, in the general election environment, the factor of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress President Rahul Gandhi in the state can spread to the rest of India including Telangana

 west indies cricket par sankat bana hua he
 The players are adamant on their demand and the West Indies Cricket Board is not showing any interest in persuading the players
 aise main sabase bada sawaal yahi he ki kya westeindies cricket team agle saal hone vaale world cap main hissaa legi
 Although there is still at least three months left for the World Cup to begin, the situation is becoming such that the West Indies team can get out without playing in the World Cup
 west indies ke baahar hone se honkong kii cricket team ko world cap main khilne kaa mauka mil jayega
 The first two teams in the qualifier tournament, Scotland and the United Arab Emirates, have qualified for the World Cup
 west indies ke baahar hone se tisare number par rahi honkong kii kismat khul sakati he
 It is clear that when the West Indian players decided to leave the tour of India, they all said that they had no other option left
 west indies cricket board ne bhi khiladiyon ko manaane kii disha main ab tak koi pahal nahin kii
 It is clear that neither the West Indies Cricket Board nor the West Indies cricketers will have any idea of the damage caused by this controversy
 daura bich main chhodane kii vajah se bhartiya cricket board ne westeindies board ke khilaaf saare sambandh tod liye hai
 This means that neither India will visit the West Indies nor call the West Indies
 itnaa hi nahin bhartiya cricket board westeindies board par tivi prasaaran se hue nuksaan ke harjane ke liye cese kiya to phir westeindies cricket board kangaali ke haal tak pahunch saktaa he
 Obviously the crisis of West Indies cricket is getting deeper
 agle maheene se dakshin africa team ko westeindies kaa daura karnaa he, lekin maujuuda vivaad ke chalate siries par bhi sankat aa gaya he
 This has raised concerns about Digicel Television Network, the largest sponsor company in West Indies cricket
 jaahir he agar board or khilaadiyon kaa vivaad nahin sulajhaa to caribian cricket kii mushkil or badhegi, lekin westeindies board or khilaadiyon main samjhaute ke asaar nahin dikh rahe

 We are taught about the ethos of the game as a player from a very young age
 apane kariyar main ham nishpaksh hokar eemaandaaree se or asal khel bhaavana se khilne kii kai baar kasame khate hai
 These values become part of our character
 ham yah sab isliye karte hai kyonki ham apane khel or olympic andolan kaa sammaan karte hai or usase pyaar karte hai
 Therefore, is it not fair to expect sports administrators to follow the highest ethical standards too? Players across the country want their sports to be handled by such clean people who work transparently and openly Can do
 ham bahut pareshaan hai kyonki ab yah jaahir ho chukaa he ki sirf swarthsiddhi main lage bhartiya olympic sangh ke maujuuda adhikariyon ko hamaare hiton kii chintaa na ke baraabar he
 India won 6 medals at the Olympic Games last year at its best
 uske baad ab antarrashtriya olympic samiti ne bhartiya olympic sangh ko isliye nilambit kar diya kyonki hamaare adhikari vibhinn rashtriya khel parisanghon par sanathan niyantran jari rakhane or apane badnaam aakaaon ko bachaane main ji-jaan se jute hue the
 The achievements of India in Beeching 2008 and London 2012 could have spread the Olympic movement in the country
 buniyadi suvidhaon or koching ke str main sudhaar, khiladinnon or khelon ke vikaas tathaa buniyadi str ke kaaryakramon ke jariye 2016, 2020 or 2024 ke olympic khelon kii taiyaari kii ja sakati thi
 But our sports administrators are fighting over whether corrupt people should be allowed to contest elections
 bhala isamen sochane kii kya baat he ki agar aap par aarope tay ho chuke hai yani adaalat ne police jaanch par gaur karne or aaropee ko apane bachaav kaa mauka dene ke baad yah tay kar liya he ki mukadmaa shuru karne laayak paryaapt saboot hai to aap alag hat jaaen
 We sportspersons would like to know if the administrators wishing to become leaders of our Olympic movement have a blueprint? They can understand the meaning of the term very well because some of them are professional politicians
 aakhir desh main khelon ko aage badhaane ke liye unki kya yojanaayen hai?ve khiladinnon ke liye kya karnaa chaahate hai? pratibha ko nikhaarane ke liye ve kya karnaa chaahate hai? puraane khiladinnon kii dekhbhaal ve kaise karnaa chaahate hai? par unki harkaton se saaf jaahir he ki unhen to aise sawaal sujhte bhi nahin
 The rationale behind making politicians sports administrators instead of trained and professional players is that they can raise money
 agar yah sach he to bhartiya olympic team kaa koi sthaayee praayojak kyon nahin he? kaarobaari gharaanon se baat kiijie to ve saaf kehete hai ki paardarshita na hone kii vajah se unhen ek rupaya bhi dene main hichak he
 Every Indian player can tell you how inept coaches are sent on tours and officials who have no knowledge of the game have been sitting in their positions for 20 or 30 years
 hamaare rashtriya nauka chaalkon ko ek baar pashuon ke baade main rahanaa padaa or saajha upyog ke liye washing mashin or cooler kharidne ko khud paise jutaney pade
 a similar story is about an Olympic player who had to be forced to hail
 ye sabhi kisse hamaari jindagi kaa hissaa hai
 But the most shocking thing is that these administrators are allowing the Indian Olympic Association to remain suspended for a long time
 bhartiya athlete antarrashtriya olympic samiti ke jhande ke neeche khilne par majaboor hai, jiske kaaran ve us raashtra gaurav kii bhaavana or josh se vanchit rah jate hai jo unke pradarshan main thodi or jaan daal detaa he
 i may not have said this often, but the truth is that the happiest moment of my career was when the Indian tricolor was hoisted in Beeching and the tune of the national anthem rang
 mujhase or mere saathi khiladinnon se vah ehsaas chin lenaa behad buree baat he
 The Indian Olympic movement needs leadership that we respect, not because of their political status, but because of their contribution to sports and sportspersons
 hamen aise logon kii jarurat he jo apane kaamon se prerit kar saken or jo aisi vyavasthaaen karne kii ichha jaahir kar saken jinase hamen phir kabhi mushkil main na funsana pade
 Meaningful reforms, stringent ethical norms, preferential outcomes, a system that cannot be corrupted, and handing over its operations into professional hands to make the Indian Olympic Association effective is the need of the hour
 aisa hone par hamaare prashaasak, sapanili ankhon vaale lakhon bhartiya khiladinnon kii sadbhaavna hasil kar sakenge
 Goodwill is not a bad thing
 isse bank khate nahin balki garv se seene phoolate hai jise kharida nahin ja saktaa
 Abhinav Bindra is the international shooter and the only Indian player to win an individual gold medal at the Olympic Games

 The Prime Minister's team should have been informed about this

 Significantly, the economic condition of Pakistan is very bad
 pakistan kaa khajaana khaali he, jaruri kharchon ke liye sarkaar ke paas dhan nahin he

 pakistan ke kai ilaake pani kii ghor samasya se jujh rahe hai or iske liye vahaan kai dam banane kii jarurat he
 But Pakistan does not have money for dams, so these days donations are being collected from people in Pakistan
