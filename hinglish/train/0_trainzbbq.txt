 '' desh kii dalit siyasat ke falak par do yuva chehron ne dastak di he
 One of these is Jignesh Mevani, who came out of the Dalit movement in Gujarat, and the other is Chandrashekhar Ravan, the chief of the Bhim army, who came into the limelight due to the dalit-rajput violence in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh
 in donon yuva chehron ne bispi pramukh mayawati kii bechaini badha di he kyonki ye unki siyasat ke liye chunauti ban rahe hai
 This is the reason that Mayawati was seen warning her supporters to these leaders on her 62nd birthday
 jignesh se bhaybheet mayawati?mayawati ne apane 62wein janmdin par party samarthakon ko gujarat ke dalit netaa jignesh mewaani se sachet kiya
 He said that Jignesh has definitely won the election as an independent, but there is no contribution of Dalit votes in him
 congress ke haath kaa saath milane se jignesh vidhayak bane hai
 The Congress is now sending Jignesh from place to place in the country behind the scenes
 isaki aad main wo phayda uthaanaa chaahati he
 This requires the Dalit society to remain vigilant
 dalit siyasat ke sameekarnabta den ki desh bhar main kareeb 20 fisadi dalit matadaata hai
 Dalit voters were with the Congress at one stage, but after 1980 there was a big change in Dalit politics
 isamen bispi ke sansthaapak kanshiram kii ahm bhoomika rahi
 It was only in the 80s that Mayawati emerged in Indian politics
 kanshiram hi mayawati ko siyasat main laae
 He turned the Dalit ideology into a political party, which later changed the politics of North India
 bispi se mayawati kaa udbhavkanshiram kii mehnat se khadi kii gai bispi ne desh ke sabase bade soobe upi main satta par kabja kiya
 Mayawati became the Chief Minister for the first time in 1995
 iske baad mayawati ne badalte samay ke saath bahujan ke naare ko sarvajan main tabdeel kar diya
 The result was good and Mayawati's BSP came to power in UP with an absolute majority in 2007, but the BSP did not return to power in 2012 and its countdown began
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bispi kaa ek bhi saansad nahin jeeta
 In 2017 too, the BJP lost all its dream of coming to power and the party slipped to the third position in the state
 mayawati ke liye kya khatra banenge jignesh?dalit netaa jignesh mewaani bhale hi gujarat se nirdaleey vidhayak bane hai, lekin desh ke baaki rajyon main bhi sakriy bhoomika nibhaane ke liye nikal pade hai
 Manuwad and feudalism have always been the targets of Mayawati's politics
 jignesh mewaani bhi isi moolmantra ke jariye aage bad rahe hai
 Recently, at Jantar Mantar, Jignesh Mevani asked PM Narendra Modi to choose between the Constitution and Manusmriti
 is tarah wo mayawati ke siyaasi formule ko apana hathiyaar banaakar unke liye chunauti ban rahe hai
 Compared to Mayawati, Jignesh is outspoken, young and knows how to use social media
 dalit yuvakon ke bich unki lokapriyata badhati ja rahi he
 Crowds are gathering on her departure from Gujarat, Delhi, Maharashtra to Uttar Pradesh, which has upset Mayawati
 mayawati ke durg main ravan kii dastakabhim sena ke pramukh chandrashekhar ravan uttar pradesh se hai or mayawati kii hi jati se aate hai
 Ravana founded the Bhima Army, an organization of Dalits in Saharanpur
 2016 main ye sanghathan teji se ubharne laga or bahut hi kam samay main dalit samaaj ke bich chandrashekhar lokapriy ho gaye
 West UP is considered to be a strong fort of Mayawati
 upi main kareeb 19 fisadi dalit matadaata hai, unamem bhi jatav kii bhagidaari 16 fisadi he
 Mayawati comes from this society and Chandrashekhar Ravana too
 chandrashekhar ne pashchim upi ke saharanpur ke dalit yuvaaon ko apane saath joda, haalat ye ho gaye ki gaanv ke baahar 'da great chamaar' ke bade-bade board laga die gaye
 a month after the formation of the Yogi government in UP, there was violence between the Dalit and Rajput society in Shabbirpur of Saharanpur
 hinsa main kai ghar jala die gaye
 The police accused Chandrasekhar of plotting this violence and leading the mob and put him in jail
 chandrashekhar ab bhi jail main band hai
 Mayawati talks about Shabbirpur, but Chandrashekhar does not speak a word for Ravana
 jaankaron kii maane to unhen kahin na kahin chandrashekhar ravan se siyaasi dar sata rahaa he
 jignesh-ravanigignesh Mevani's Congress connection is well known to be a trump card for Congress
 agar party chandrashekhar ravan ko bhi apane kheme main laane main safal hoti he to in do yuva chehron ke jariye wo mayawati ke dalit voton main send laga sakati he
 Also, Dalit leaders can be given a new option in the country
 dalit-muslim-pichde gathjod ke bal par congress ko apane achche din waapas lautne kii ummid he
 How successful she is in this will be known in 2019, but at present, the lines of concern are clearly visible on the forehead of BSP supremo Mayawati, standing on the shoulders of Kanshi Ram and on the basis of Dalit votes

 chote-bade donon pardon par sani chai rahati hai
 On the birthday of this kind of star, a fan has written a letter to him from the heart
 
 
 dear sani,bollywood is baat kaa gavaah rahaa he ki jab bhi kisi bold bala kii entry industry main hoti he to kuch din us actress kii khumaari darshakon ke dilon-dimag main rahati he lekin dhire-dhire unki ye deewangi feeki padane lagati he
 But this is not the case in your case
 film industry main entry karne se pehle hamamen se kai tumko khub 'dekh' chuke the baavjood iske tumhaari hindi filmon ke liye theatres main phans kaa footfal kam nahin hua
 Because the fan is the fan who wants to see his star in every form
 lekin ek baat main tumko bataanaa chaahati hum ki tumhaari khubsuurati or maasoomiyat ne kabhi is bold image ko foohad banane hi nahin diya
 Regarding being a porn star, your craze was in the audience, but i have read a lot and seen that this path has not been easy for you
 tumko kaam mil rahaa he, jabaki 'decent becoground' se aane vaale kai industry main khaali hi baithai hai
 You are completely honest about the past thing and this quality makes you different from other hot actresses
 acchhee baat yah he ki tumko past kaa bilkul bhi pachhtaawaa nahin he, kyonki tumne ise ek prafeshan kii tarah liya he
 i have also seen an amazing strength inside you
 tab jab porn star image kii aad main bune gaye sawaalon ke jariye kaiintervyuu main tumkojalil karne yaa asahaj karne kii koshish kii gai
 But you neither get scared nor agree nor lose such situations
 har utapantag sawaal kaa bina munh phere jawaab diya or iske baad se industry ke kai 'bade log' tumhaare saath ho gaye
 Many intellectuals accused Netum of serving obscenity in Parasinema, but they probably forgot films from the 70s and 80s when you were not even born
 kai bade filmmekar tab tak screen par 'bahut kuch' dikhaa chuke the
 Have read your life story
 15 saal kii umr main bekri main kaam kar tum ghar kii jimmedaariyaan uthaa rahi thim
 Perhaps this is why you know how to make a difficult situation, have to work hard and do not pay attention to the useless things of others
 tumhaari isi spirit ko hi nateeja he ki jo log tumhen apni chaah nahin rahe the, unheen ke bich tum 'sani' bani hui ho sani

 Maharashtra's numerology would be something like this - BJP 144, Shiv Sena 108, NCP 24 and Congress 12
 isi tarah haryana kaa scoreboard hota- bijepi 63, ieneldi 18 or congress 9
 You will ask why
 to iskaa jawaab he ki loksabhaa chunaav main modi lahar ke dauraan in pradeshon main sabhi partiyon ne isi anupaat main loksabhaa siten jiti thim
 In Maharashtra, the Congress had to win two and in Haryana only one Lok Sabha seat was satisfied
 lekin chaar maheene baad nattejey badal gaye hai
 BJP 144 is around 110 and Congress 12 is not around 40-50
 shisvena 108 kii jagah 50-60 ke bich jhul rahi he or sharad pavaar kii party kaa kanta bhi 50 par takkar maar rahaa he
 What changed in Maharashtra in four months? At least the Congress has not done such a great job that its possible seats will increase by 350 percent in four months
 or media main bhrashtachar ke aaropon se buree tarah badnaam ho chuki ensipi 2009 ke str se thodi hi neeche aae
 Then what is the revenge! The passion that has changed during the Lok Sabha elections

 In that election, when we journalists roamed from city to city passing through villages, the sensation of modi-modi was in the air
 shaayad vah sansani chaar maheene main utar gai he
 Modi is now a popular leader
 lekin lahar, aandhi yaa tsunami nahin hai
 This is a good sign for democracy
 jaraa yaad kiijie pichhlaa oktober
 Then Modiji climbed turmeric
 bijepi ne kaha tha ki pradhanmantri pad ke liye vahi uske var hai
 After that, in the elections of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the public yearned the opposition for one seat each
 chhattisgarh main ummid thi ki jiram ghati main mare congressi netaaon kii sahanubhuti jaisi koi lahar hogi lekin modi lahar ke aage koi lahar nahin chali
 BJP had already conquered Delhi, it became a new experiment of Kejriwal in the middle
 uske baad loksabhaa main to uttar bharat ke saare kshatrap tinakon kii haisiyat main aa gaye
 There was a flood of Modiji like Indira Gandhi or Rajiv Gandhi
 lekin jab yah aakraamak prachaar abhiyaan khatm hua to loksabhaa ke baad hue sabhi upachunaav bijepi ek ke baad ek harati chali gai
 Low voter turnout was also considered as a reason for this
 saath hi yah bhi kaha gaya ki janata ko lag rahaa he ki vah kuch zyada modimay ho gai he, isliye to sajag rahanaa jaruri he
 In such a situation, the mandate of Maharashtra and Haryana is a sign of healthy democracy
 logon ne party ko sirf vot diya he, kalejaa nikaalkar nahin rakh diya he
 There is also scope for opposition
 yah bahut jaruri he kyonki puure duniya ke loktantr kaa sabase bada virodhabhas yahi he ki jise aap haraate hai agle paanch saal tak vahi aapkaa zyada bada hitaishi dikhaai detaa he
 The voice of the public in Parliament never raises the power of opposition, the opposition raises it

 ) Delhi Metro Rail Corporation is now planning to increase passenger fares
 2009 se lagu kiraye par ab tak chal rahi dilli metro dilli-ensiaar ko bada jhatka de sakati he
 According to sources, DMRC is running at a loss
 ab is ghate se ubarne ke liye hidilli kii metro trainon main yatri kirayabadhaye jane kii baaten chal rahi hai
 However, DMRC officials say that the real reason behind the increase in fares is safe functioning, cleanliness and maintenance at metro stations
 sabhi jaanate hai ki dilli metro kaa dhaancha 13 saal purana ho chukaa he or duusari taraf bijli bhi mahangi hoti ja rahi he
 In such a situation, increasing the fare is bound to happen
 pichhali baar saal2009 main dilli metro kaa yatri kiraaya rivijakiya gaya tha
 Since then, the fare of the metro is the same
 lekin kiraaya kab se badhegaa is khabar kii pushti kisi sambandhit adhikari ne nahin kii he or na hi kiraye main sanshodhan ke liye nai fere phikseshan cameti banaayi gai he
 No official statement has come from the Ministry of Urban Development, the nodal agency of Delhi Metro
 lekin department ke andar chal rahi afvaahon kii maane to metro main safar ke liye aapako 10 se lekar 50 rupye tak kaa kiraaya chukaana pad saktaa he
 At present, DMRC has kept the existing fare of 8 to 30 rupees in 15 classes
 lekin kiraaya badaye jane par ab 10 se 50 rupye ke kiraye ko 5 virgon main rakhe jane kaa prastaav diya gaya he
 Accordingly, revenue is expected to grow by 38%

 There is a demand from the Trinamool Congress that the name of West Bengal be Bangla, a proposal has also been sent from the state government
 haalanki, centre sarkaar kii abhi tak manjuuri nahin mil pai he
 a few days ago TMC leaders led by Sudeep Bandopadhyay met PM Modi on this issue

 He has openly spoken out against the central government on many issues

 a princely state separating India and Pakistan from each other, who refused to meet both countries after independence
 kyonki us riyasat ke raja ko laga ki wo apni is sultanate ko jananath se bhi khubasurat banayega
 The world of so beautiful be forced to see it
 magar jananath banane se pehle hi kuch log use jahannum banane kii saazish rachane lage
 Then a letter saved the paradise from becoming a creature
 jise instrument of exceshan kaha jaataa he
 But there was a stream recorded in this instrument of accession
 dhara 370
 15 August 1947 when India gained independence from the British rule
 us vakt desh kii maujuuda sarhad main 565 princeli state yani azaad riyaasaten thim
 After independence, except 3 of these princely states, all agreed to merge in India
 ye riyaasaten thim
 Jammu and Kashmir, Junagadh and Hyderabad
 us vakt sarkaar kii koshishon se junagarh or hyderabad kaa to vilay bharat main ho gaya
 But Maharaja Hari Singh of Jammu and Kashmir wanted his Kashmir to be an independent state
 lihaaja unhone bharat or pakistan ke saath stand still samjhaute kii pahal kii
 The purpose of that agreement was to give them some more time to merge with India or Pakistan
 pakistan ne to maharaja hari singh ke saath ye samjhauta kar liya lekin bharat ne un halaat main intjaar karnaa hi behatar samajha
 Actually, India was waiting for the accession of Kashmir and Maharaja Hari Singh Azad was following the dream of Kashmir
 24 oktober 1947pakistan ne samjhauta tod diya or kabayaliyon kii aad main kashmir par chadhaai kar di
 He was going to occupy the capital Srinagar at any time
 or agar aisa ho jaataa to kashmir aaj pakistan kaa hissaa hota
 But Maharaja Hari Singh preferred to seek military help from the Indian government instead of bowing down to Pakistan
 magar bharat sarkaar ne maharaja hari singh kii madad karne ke liye ek shart rakh di
 The condition was that India merge
 lihaaza maukey kii nazaakat ko dekhte hue maharaja hari singh vilay ko taiyaar ho gaye
 And the very next morning VP Menon, a close officer of Sardar Patel, left for Kashmir from Delhi to take stock of the situation
 menon sardaar patel ke netritv vaale rajyon ke mantralay ke sachiv the
 By the time Menon met Maharaja Hari Singh in Srinagar, the attackers had reached Baramulla
 aise main unhone maharaja ko turant jammu ravaanaa ho jane ko kaha or ve khud kashmir ke pradhanmantri mehrchand mahajan ko saath lekar dilli laut aae
 On 26 October 1947, the situation was such that the capital of Kashmir could be occupied by the attackers at any time
 maharaja hari singh bharat se madad kii ummid lagaae baithe the
 In such a situation, Lord Mountbatten advised Sardar Patel that Hari Singh should get the Instrument of Accession signed before sending Indian troops to Kashmir
 lihaaza menon ko ek baar phir se jammu ravaanaa kiya gaya
 And on this day Menon got Maharaja Hari Singh to sign the Instrument of Accession and immediately returned to Delhi with it
 kya tha instrument of exeshnahar hindustani ke zehan main ye sawaal abhi bhi uthte hai ki aakhir us vakt jammu-kashmir ke is instrument of exceshan main tha kya? darasal, jammu kashmir ke liye bane instrument of exceshan main tha ki centre ko sirf jammu-kashmir ke raksha, videsh or sanchaar se sambandhit kanoon banane kaa adhikaar hoga
 The rest of the issues will be handled by the state itself
 iske cloj 5 main raja hari singh ne saaf kiya tha ki is instrument of exceshan ko kisi bhi sanshodhan ke jariye badla nahin ja sakegaa
 Only Raja Hari Singh will have the right to change it
 or jab tak hari singh koi duusare instrument of exceshan par sin nahin karte purana vaala hi maanya hoga
 In the future, if the Constitution of India is formed, they will not be considered committed to accept it
 na hi unhen bhavishya main banane vaale samvidhan ke mutabik bharat sarkaar ke saath kisi samjhaute ke liye kaha jayega
 On 27 October 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh signed the merger agreement and on the very next day, 27 October, the then Governor General of independent India Lord Mountbatten approved the agreement on behalf of India
 haalanki kashmir jin halaaton main bharat kaa hissaa bana wo hinsa kaa daur tha
 And India's policy was that the merging princely states in which there is any problem
 vahaan refrendom yani janamat sangrah karvaa kar logon kii manshaa ke mutabik vilay ho
 Not at the will of the king
 magar kashmir ke masale par aisa nahin ho sakaa tha
 At that time Lord Mountbatten also said that it is the wish of the government that as soon as law and order is restored in Kashmir
 vaise hi rajya ko bharat main shaamil karne kaa faisla vahaan ke logon ke mat ke hisaab se liya jayega
 Article 370 was passed on May 27, 1949
 In the year 1948, the Government of India wrote in the white paper on Jammu and Kashmir that Kashmir's inclusion in India is purely temporary and short-lived
 jammu kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri shaikh abdulla ko 17 may 1949 ko vallabhbhai patel or en
 In a letter written with the consent of Gopalaswami Iyengar, former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru repeated the same thing
 or vilay ke vakt jammu-kashmir sarkaar ne jo draft taiyaar kiya tha
 Negotiations continued for about five months to reach an agreement on that
 iske baad 27 may 1949 ko artical 306 a paarit kar diya gaya
 Which was later known as 370
 samvidhan main is anuchhed ko asthaayee bataaya gaya he yani ki ise kuch saalon ke baad khatm hona tha lekin baad kii sarkaron ne ise khatm nahin kiya or ye anuchhed chalata rahaa
 Rather in 1954, the then President Dr
 rajendra prasad ke aadesh se anuchhed 35 e ko anuchhed 370 kaa hissaa bana diya gaya
 Under this, Jammu and Kashmir was allowed to make its own constitution and not to implement the Indian Constitution except for a few sections
 to ab sawaal uthta he ki kashmir kis tarah bharat main shaamil hua
 With the help of Instrument of Accession or Section 370? So the first bridge in this is the Instrument of Accession
 kyonki ye 1947 main hi sin ho gaya tha
 Article 370 came into existence in 1949
 magar kanuunan anuchhed 370 main jis anuchhed 1 kaa ullekh he
 Through this, Jammu and Kashmir has been included in the list of states of India
 jammu-kashmir ko mili inhen khaas adhikaron ko lekar pichley 70 saalon se bahes chali aa rahi he
 And now on August 5, 2019, Home Minister Amit Shah has spoken of doing it in two parts
 yani maharaja hari singh kii riyasat-e-kashmir kii sava karod aabaadi or sava do lakh varg kimi kaa ilaaka ab do hisson main bant jayega

 kendriya mantri faruk abdulla ne mahilaon par vivaadaaspad bayaan dene ke kuch hi ghante baad maafee maang lee
 Farooq Abdullah said that men are afraid to even talk to women, because they feel that they might have to go to jail
 faruk abdulla ke bete or jammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne apane pita ke bayaan par kaha ki unhen (faruk ko) maafee maangani chahie
 Farooq Abdullah said, Nowadays i am afraid to talk to women too
 vastav main main kisi mahila ko sachiv bhi nahin rakhana chahta, kya pataa koi shikaayat darj ho jaae or mujhe jail janaa pad jaae
 Nowadays such an atmosphere has been created
 unhone kaha ki isamen koi shaq nahin ki aajkal rape kii vaardaat bad gai he
 
 
 But there must be a blockage somewhere
 unhone fouran yah bhi kaha ki vah mahilaon ko dosha nahin de rahe hai, balki samaaj ko dosha de rahe hai
 Farooq's statement came in the context of allegations of sexual harassment against Tehelka founder Tarun Tejpal and Justice AK Ganguly
 abdulla ke bayaan se vivaad uth khadaa hua, or saamaajik kaaryakartaaon or vipakshi dal ke netaaon ne abdulla kii baton ko anuchit bataaya
 BJP leader Smriti Irani said, "it is a very inappropriate statement, especially to make such a statement on the stairs of Parliament, it is very unfair
" unka yah bayaan yah sanket detaa he ki mahilaon ko sirf isliye kaam par rakhaa jaataa he ki unhen apamaanit kiya ja sake yaa nicha dikhaaya ja sake
 Later, in an attempt to calm the dispute, Farooq said, people should understand things and they are misrepresenting many things in many ways
 faruk ne kaha ki unhen mahasoos hota he ki ab samay aa gaya he, jab nyaay hona chahie or sansad main jald se jald 33 pratishat aarakshan (mahilaon ke liye) hona chahie
 He said that if he has said something wrong, he regrets it
 meraa aisa aashay katai nahin tha, jaisaa janata ne mahasoos kiya he

 pradhanmantrine kaha ki agar aap yah sochate hai ki ham ek desh ko alag-thalag karne ke liye duniya main itnaa kathin parishram kar rahe hai, tab yah galat he
 This is not our business
 haa, duniya aatankwaad kii buraai kaa saamana kar rahi he or jo bhi aatankwaadiyon ke prati sahanubhuti rakhte hai, unke khilaaf duniya ekajute ho rahi he
 He said that India's foreign policy is based on issues and in terms of relations with the world
 modi ne aatankwaad ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane ke liye america raashtrapati donald trump kii prashansa kii
 He said that i welcome him
 jo bhi aatankwaad ke khilaaf koi kadam uthaayegaa, main uskaa swaagat karuunga, unki prashansa karuunga kyonki meraa desh 40 varshon se aatankwaad se peedit he
 Innocent people are being killed
 duniya main aatankwaad ke khatme kii jarurat he
 In the context of Pakistan, the Prime Minister said that he has always said that India and Pakistan have fought a lot and now we must fight poverty and disease
 unhone kaha ki main pakistan ke logon se sidhe kahana chahta hum ki kya hamen garibi se nahin ladanaa chahie? kya hamen nirakshartaa se nahin ladanaa chahie? kya hamen beemaari se nahin ladanaa chahie
 If we fight with them together then we will win quickly

 com / taarikh ke panne aise hazaron taanaashaahon ke naamon se bhare hue hai
 
 jinhone gaddi ke liye apane baap, bhai or rishtedaaron tak ko marava diya
 Now if any of his officers look at the throne of such a dictator, then imagine what they will do to their fate
 zaahir he use aisi kaufanaak maut di jaaegi ki log uske bare main sun kar hi kaanp uthen
 You must have heard about all such cruel methods
 magar kya kabhi ye bhi suna he ki kisi ko maarane ke liye use equarium main piranha machhliyon ke saamne phinkava diya jaae
 No? So now listen, North Korea's President Kim Jong Un has given this cruel punishment to his 5 officials
 kim jong un
 
 aaj ke daur main yun to khauf paidaa karne ke liye is insaan kaa naam hi kaaphi he
 But still, it is often tried that its dominance in the world should not be reduced
 kyonki dar khatm ho gaya to korea main iske liye sultanate kaayam rakhana bhi mushkil ho jayega
 And in North Korea, one of its generals conspired to overthrow its power
 kim kii sultanate main shaayad isse badi galati ho hi nahin sakati
 Of course, Kim Jong had to punish his general so that no one could even think of doing so
 lihaaza apane general kii gaddari kii sazaa tay karne main kim jong un ne vakt liya
 And he watched all the movies in which brutal to cruel methods were adopted to give death
 tab jaakar uski nazar 1965 main release hui james bond kii you only liv twis film par tiki
 In which a woman is thrown into a tank full of piranha fishes to kill her
 jahaan apane nukile tej daanton se piranha machhliyaan wo kar detii hai jiske bare main koi sapane main bhi nahin soch saktaa
 First of all, know what the name of this piranha fish is
 piranha machhliyaan duniya kii sabase khatarnaak machhliyon main shumaar hai
 Whose teeth are so sharp that it takes only a few seconds for a whole person to eat them
 ye machhliyaan kitni khatarnaak or khoonkhaar hai ye aap inke daanton ko dekh kar andaaza laga sakate hai
 The water in which these fish occur
 vahaan koi or pani kaa jeev batch nahin paata
 Moreover, these fish also do not indulge in eating humans
 or inhen machhliyon se bhare ek tanks main uttar korea ke marshall kim jong un ne apane general ko daalkar use uski gaddari kii sazaa di he
 You may take time to believe this news but it is Kim Jong Un
 ye apni sultanate ke gaddaaron ko bakhshata nahin he
 Nor does it have any scope of apology for those who make mistakes
 uttarkoria ke marshall kim jong un ne james band kii is film se prerit hokar uskaa takhtapalat kii yojana bana rahe apane general ko in aadamkhor machhliyon ke tanks main phikwakar di ye ruh compane vaali maut
 The Daily Star, a tabloid news paper in the UK, claimed that Kim had dumped his general in a pond full of piranha fish due to suspicion of loyalty
 itnaa hi nahin daily star kaa daawa he ki kim ne pyongyong ke apane rongsong bangale main ek bada talab banavaa rakhaa he
 In which piranha fishes are grown
 or mana ja rahaa he ki kim ne isi talab main apane general ko zindaa phenk diya
 Another theory is that he cut his general's hands and feet and threw them in the pond
 or uske general kii laash ke saath baaki kii krurta piranha machhliyon ne anjaam di
 However the general died of piranha fishes or was already killed and thrown into the tank
 abhi tak is baat kii pushti nahin hui he
 This news seems unsurprising to hear, but it is also possible given the history of North Korea's Marshal Kim Jong Un's brutality
 isi british akhbaar ne daawa kiya he ki kim ke ghar main bane tanks main saikadon kii taadada main ye piranha machhliyaan brazil se mangvayi gai hai
 Even before this, there have been reports of death penalty of officials from North Korea
 lekin kuch maukon par aisi reportein galat bhi sabit hui hai or jinke bare main mrit hone kaa daawa kiya gaya wo dobaaraa sabake saamne bhi aa chuke hai
 Not only this, the news of North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un's death sentence to his 16 high officials was also revealed after the agreement was not reached with the US
 yah saal rithik roshan or kangana ranot kii ladaai kaa gavaah rahegaa
 The battle of these two caught a lot of vigor, their news kept coming with new revelations daily
 kuch samay se donon shant hai or apane kaam main biji hai
 But now after so many days, Hrithik's father Rakesh Roshan is seen breaking his silence
 ek akhbaar ko die intervyuu memrakesh roshanane kaha, 'rithik bahut shant or garima main rahanaa pasand karata he
 If he brings the truth to everyone, then people will be shocked
 ' rakesh roshan ne yah bhi kaha kiritibhi apni film main biji hai
 As soon as they are free, they can talk about it, it will be their decision
 kahaan se shuru hua maamalakangana ne pinkavila ko ek intervyuu dete hue 'sili eks' shabd kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Actually, some time back the news came, Kikanganako was removed from the film 'aashiqui 3' only on Hrithik's suggestion
 jabakanganaase is bare main sawaal kiya gaya to unhone kaha tha, 'mujhe kai ajeeb afvaahen sunne ko mil rahi hai
 Even a mindless person can guess where these rumors are coming from
 i do not know why the Xs do such crazy things to get your attention
 meri taraf se ye chapter khatm ho chukaa he or ab main un baton kii kabr khodna nahin chaahati
 Right after this, Tritik had said by tweeting that the women with whom the media is referring to my relationship is more likely to have a relationship with a pope
 ab sawaal ye uthta he kikanganane rithik kaa ek baar bhi naam nahin liya phir unhen itani mirchi kyon lagi

 In the Karnataka elections today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi used PPP to tighten the Congress
 piem ne kaha ki is chunaav ke baad congress punjab, puducheri or parivaar main hi simit ho jaaegi
 On this attack of PM, the Chief Minister of the state Siddaramaiah also retaliated
 siddharmaiya ne bhitin pika istemaal karte hue bhaajapa ko prijan, price rij or pakora party bataaya
 After Modi's attack, Siddaramaiah said in a tweet that dear Modiji, have heard that you gave the new abbreviation PPP today
 shriman, hamane hameshaa demokrasi (loktantr) ke teen p - of da pipul , by da pipul , four da pipul ( janata kaa, janata ke liye, janata ke dwaara) kii himaayat kii he
 Whereas, your party is Prison, Price Rise and Pakoda Party
 kya main sahi hum, mahoday?dear Modi ಅವರೇ,heard you spun a new abbreviation ‘PPP’ today
 Sir, we have always championed the 3 Ps of democracy - 'of the People, By the People, For the People'
 While your party is a ‘prison’, ‘price Rise’ & ‘pakoda’ party
 Am i right, Sir? # nijahelimodi — Siddaramaiah (@siddaramaiah) May 5, 2018 Significantly, today, PM Modi lashes out at the Siddaramaiah government, alleging that it has become a "corruption tank" for the Congress, whose pipeline from Delhi Is connected and where the money reaches directly
 piem ne gadag main ek chunavi sabha main kaha ki 15 may ke baad bhartiya rashtriya congress ghatakar pipipi congress yani punjab, puducheri or parivaar congress rah jaaegi
 He said that the ruling party of the state will be defeated in this election
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki maharashtra, goa, gujarat, rajasthan, madhyapradesh, chhattisgarh, uttar pradesh, uttarakhand, himachal pradesh or tripura main ek ke baad ek chunavi haar ke baavjood congress utani chintit nahin thi jitani ab he, jab use haar spasht najar aa rahi he

 The tank is connected to Delhi via a pipeline, which carries the money directly to Delhi

 Now the BJP is eyeing independents
 yadi saat main se chah nirdaleey bhi use samarthan de dete hai to uskaa sarkaar banane kaa rasta saaf ho jayega
 Though the BJP can easily form the government even if it takes support from the JJP, but perhaps the BJP does not want to get into a bargain with the JJP and hence has focused on independents instead of JJP

 ek saal se bhi kam umr kii is party ne 10 siten jitkar haryana kii raajnneeti main apni taqatvar maujuudagi darj karai he
 JJP was born after breaking away from the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), the main regional party of the state
 jejepi ne jahaan pehali baar main hi apana asar dikhaa diya jabaki 19 siton kaa nuksaan uthaakar inelo ko tagada jhatka jhelana padaa he
 In the wake of hung assembly, former Chief Minister and Congress leader Bhupendra Singh Hooda has appealed to the anti-bjp parties including JJP to support the Congress to form the government

 a post shared by Sapna Choudhary (@itssapnachoudhary_) on Aug 15, 2018 at 10:54 pm PDT mahaj chah din ke andar 20 javaanon kii maut, wo bhi loin of control par, lekin seemaa paar se golabari main nahi balki barfile tufaan or himaskhalan se
 Hearing is not believing but this is the truth
 aisa bhi nahin he ki ab elosi par barfbaari kii vajah se or maut nahin hogi
 According to the army, they cannot leave their post under any circumstances, even if they have to pay the price for it
 vajah he sena pakistan par kisi bhi suurate haal main yakeen nahin kar sakati kyonki ek baar kargil ke vakt yakeen kiya tha, jisaki keemat kareeb 600 javaanon ko jaan dekar chukaani padi
 Let us tell you that before 1999 Kargil Jung means that the army of India and Pakistan used to trust each other in the cold days and used to vacate the high posts of inaccessible areas every year, but since Pakistan cheated, the Indian Army had its The checkpoints stopped emptying
 ab agar gurej kii baat karen to vahaan par disambar ke baad se barfbaari kii vajah se sadak maarg band ho jaataa he
 The only way to get there is by helicopter
 aisa isliye kyonki bhayanak barfbaari ke kaaran chaaron ore sirf barf ke pahaad hi najar aate hai
 The entire border posts are buried under snow
 gurej ke niru post par 25 janvari ko petrol karne gayi sena kii puri party himaskhalan kii chapet main aa gai or kisi ko nahin bachaaya ja sakaa
 When the weather cleared on Monday, the bodies of these soldiers could be brought to Srinagar
 itnaa hi nahin, 28 janvari ko kupwada ke machhil sector main barfbaari kii jad me paanch jawan aa gaye
 With great difficulty these soldiers could be saved, but due to bad weather, they could not be brought to Srinagar for special treatment for two days
 aaj jab srinagar laayaa gaya to unki jaan bachaai nahin ja saki
 Since the Kargil war, it is very heavy for the army to retain such post
 ye sirf kharchila hi nahin he balki har saal kai javaanon kii jaane bhi chali jaati hai
 The comments aisa bhi nahin he ki keval bhartiya sena ke saamne aisi dikkat he balki pakistani sena bhi aisi pareshaani se jujh rahi he
 According to information received from the sources, the Pakistan Army has again asked the Indian Army to implement the verbal agreement before Kargil under which the armies of both the countries used to go to the post below in the winter season
 lekin sena kaa kahana he ki paak sena kaa itihaas rahaa he ki vah likhit samjhauton ko bhi todatii ai he to maukhik samjhauton kii kya haalat hogi, iskaa to bas andaja hi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 It is said that the Pakistani Army is also struggling with similar situations
 ek jaankaree ke mutabik, paak sena ne sijafire ke baad kai baar aise maukhik samjhauton ko phir se lagu karne kaa aagrah bhartiya sena se kiya he par bhartiya sena iske liye katai raji nahin he
 Now, if we talk about Gurez, there is a road closure since December due to snowfall
 vahaan pahunchane kaa ek maatr jariya hota he helicopter
 This is because due to terrible snowfall, only snow mountains are seen all around
 puri kii puri seemaayi chowkiyaan barf ke neeche dab jaati hai
 On January 25, the entire party of the army, which went to patrol the Neeru post of Gurez, was hit by avalanche and no one could be saved
 somvaar ko jab mausam saaf hua to in javaanon kaa shav srinagar laayaa ja sakaa
 Not only this, on January 28, five soldiers arrived in Machil sector of Kupwara due to snowfall
 badi mushkil se in javaanon ko bachaaya ja sakaa, lekin mausam kharaab hone kii vajah se do din unhen vishesh ilaaj ke liye srinagar nahin laayaa ja sakaa
 Today, when brought to Srinagar, his life could not be saved
 kargil jang ke baad se sena ko aise post par kabja banaae rakhana bahut baari pad rahaa he
 It is not only expensive but also the lives of many soldiers are lost every year
 tippaniyan It is also not that only the Indian Army has such a problem but the Pakistani Army is also facing such a problem
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik paak sena ne bhartiya sena se phir se kaha he ki wo kargil se pehle vaale maukhik samjhaute lagu kare jiske tahat donon mulkon kii senaayen sardi ke mausam main neeche ke post par chali jaati thi
 But the Army says that the Pakistan Army has a history that it has been breaking even written agreements, so what can be the condition of oral agreements, it can only be guessed
 bataaya jaataa he ki pakistani sena bhi aisi hi paristhitiyon se jujh rahi he
 According to one information, the Pakistan Army has urged the Indian Army to re-implement such verbal agreements several times after the ceasefire, but the Indian Army is not ready for this at all
 aisa bhi nahin he ki keval bhartiya sena ke saamne aisi dikkat he balki pakistani sena bhi aisi pareshaani se jujh rahi he
 According to information received from the sources, the Pakistan Army has again asked the Indian Army to implement the verbal agreement before Kargil under which the armies of both the countries used to go to the post below in the winter season

 lekin do vaastaviktaaon ko yaad rakhane kii jarurat he

 chapiens trophy main ravivaar ko bharat kaa muqabla pakistan se he
 The Pakistan team yearning to win against India is trying every bit
 haal hi ke dinon main jis tarah se team india viraat kii aguwai main khel dikhaa rahi he usase pakistan ke hosh ude hue hai
 So he is betting on every player in the team
 viraat kohli ko rokane ke liye pehle to usne tej gendbaaj junayd khan ke naam kaa hauva khadaa karne kii koshish kii
 Not only this, Junaid Khan said that Virat Kohli may be the best batsman in the world but he has dismissed Virat three times in four matches
 lekin maansik rup se behad majboot team india par iskaa koi asar nahin padataa dikhaai diya he kyonki junayd ne jab kohli ko out kiya tha to vah takneekee rup se bahut majboot nahin the lekin pichley 2 saalon main viraat ne apni sabhi kamajoriyon ko dur kar liya he
 Now looking at his batting, it seems that Virat can be out only on his own fault
 tippaniyan At the same time, Pakistan has left a new Shigufa
 bangladesh ke khilaaf abhyaas match ke baad pakistan kii media 23 saal ke olerounder khilaadi fahim ashraf ko hi sabase bada turup kaa ikkaa maanane lagi he
 On Saturday, Bangladesh kept the Pakistani bowlers flying in the practice match and set a target of 341 runs
 itane bade lakshya kaa peechha karne utari pakistan kii team ladkadaane lagi or uske 8 wicket gir gaye
 But Faheem Ashraf scored 64 runs by hitting 30 balls 4 fours and 4 sixes and gave Pakistan the victory
 unki is pari ke dauraan hasan ali ne bhi 15 gendon main do chauke or ek chakke kii madad se 27 ranon kii pari kheli
 Since then, Faheem Ashraf has been considered as a hero by Pakistan and is being called 'wonder Boy'
 pakistan ke gharelu cricket main fahim ko tej gendbaaj ko taur par janaa jaataa rahaa he lekin ek match main unhone shatak markar sabko hairat main daal diya
 He has so far scored 1207 runs in domestic cricket and also has 94 wickets in the account
 champions trophy unka pehla antarrashtriya match hoga
 But this mentally strong team India has no effect because Junaid was not technically very strong when he dismissed Kohli but in the last 2 years, Virat has overcome all his weaknesses
 
 ab unki ballebaaji dekh kar aisa lagata he ki viraat sirf apni hi galati par out ho sakate hai
 The comments vahiin pakistan ne ab nayaa shigupha choda he
 After the practice match against Bangladesh, Pakistan's media has started to consider 23-year-old allrounder player Faheem Ashraf as the biggest trump card

 During his innings, Hasan Ali also scored 27 runs in 15 balls with the help of two fours and a six
 iske baad se fahim ashraf ko pakistan ne hero maan liya he or use 'vander bvoy' kaha ja rahaa he
 In Pakistan's domestic cricket, Faheem has been known as a fast bowler, but in a match, he surprised everyone by hitting a century
 vah gharelu cricket main ab tak 1207 ran bana chuke hai or 94 wicket bhi khate main hai

 unhone kaha ki faisle ke vyapak virodh ke chalate ve partiyaan bhi iske khulkar samarthan main nahin aaengi jo iske paksh main hai
 Rawat said that due to the stalled Parliament proceedings on the issue of FDI, things related to this serious matter could not reach the public through the House, which is sad
 unhone epadiai se chote vyapaariyon par bura prabhaav padane sambandhi sawaal par kaha ki is tijaarti tabake par kuch asar to padataa he lekin utana nahin jitna ki hauvva khadaa kiya ja rahaa he

 iske liye team ke ballebaajon ko 90 over tak wicket par tikna tha

 aise main agar in sabane jimmedaari puwork ballebaaji kii hoti to ye test batch saktaa tha lekin bhartiya middle order ek baar phir flop ho gaya
 On the final day of the Lord's Test, only Suresh Raina could show some struggle from India
 unhone bharat kii duusari pari main 78 ran banaae
 He scored these runs with the help of 10 fours off 136 balls
 raina is test kii pehali pari main khaataa bhi nahin khol paae the
 Hence, he needed a big innings here to save his place in the next Test team
 78 ran kii pari khelkar unhone lagbhag apni jagah bachaa lee he
 In such a situation, it is very possible that Yuvraj Singh will have to wait for the next Test as well
