 We do not make dishes very spicy here
 khaanaa zyada taileey na ho, iskaa barkos main khaas dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he
 Sameer said, the motive behind this is that the food should be healthy and people change the idea that the restaurant cannot eat food everyday
 company barkos ko logon ke saamne sehat ke prati samvedansheel brand ke taur par pesh karnaa chaahati he
 That is why most hot chillies of Assam are not used

 Now the company has also come in the foodcourt model
 haal hi main manesar main company ne apana foodcourt kholaa he
 Sameer explains, people are being served better food in a five star environment
 "frenchiji se lekar customer or karmchaaree tak hamaare hissedaar hai or ham hai is brand ke castodian
 "the owners of Barkos say, they have about 5,000 people a day, and home delivery is different
" unka karmchaariyon ko five star ke restaraan jaisi selleri dene kaa or vahaan jaisi hi saamagree yahaan istemaal kiye jane kaa daawa he

 Significantly, in the last 1 year, there has been a huge upheaval in the Lalu family
 pichley saal party ke sthapana diwas ke maukey par jab argedy satta main thi, vahiin is baar vah satta se bedakhal ho chuki he
 27 after being convicted in the Lalu Prasad Yadav Kechara scam case

 However, he is currently out on bail at the medical ground and undergoing treatment at the Asian Heart Institute in Mumbai

 11 june ko lalu ke janmdin ke maukey par puraa parivaar satta sangharsh kii atakalon ko khaarij karte hue ek saath najar aayaa
 This week, Tej Pratap Yadav once again hinted that everything was not going well inside the family when he wrote on his Facebook account that his mother Rabri Devi does not listen to him
 tej pratap ne apnefesbuk pej par argedike do netaa omprakash yadav or subodh raay kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki yah donon netaa unki chhavi kharaab kar rahe hai, magar isaki shikaayat rabari devi se karne ke baavjood bhi unke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin ho rahi he
 When the matter started catching fire, Tej Pratap asked to calm the matter that his Facebook account was hacked by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and BJP
 in do ghatnaon se ek baat to saaf ho gai he ki lalu parivaar ke andar sab kuch thik nahin he or is baar ke sthapana diwas par party ke bade se lekar chote netaaon kii nazren hongi
 In such a situation, when Lalu's whole family is together on this occasion, what message does he give to keep the party united? car banane vaali desh kii sabase badi company maaruti sujuki india ne is saal march ke ant tak bahuddeshiy vaahan (empivi) ertiga launch karne kii yojana banaai he

 (@smnehad)june 18, 2017 Janata Dal (U) leader and former Chief Minister Nitish Kumar Brabha may be trying to unite the old 'janata Parivar' once again, but senior Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and former Union Minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh believes that Bihar Assembly RJD will play the role of 'elder brother' in the election
 bihar main chunaav agle varsh hona he
 Raghuvansh said that on the basis of the previous election, the outline of the next election is prepared
 loksabhaa chunaav main rajd ko jad (you) se zyada vot mili
 In such a situation, it is certain that under the alliance in the assembly elections, the RJD will contest the elections as the elder brother
 unhone kaha ki rajd kaa palada jad (you) se baari he
 The seat-sharing in the assembly elections will also be based on the votes polled in the Lok Sabha elections
 bihar sarkaar ke kaaryaklap ke vishay main puche jane par raghuvansh ne apane andaaj main kaha, 'pehle to mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi khud nitish kumaar se hi fariya rahe hai
 Chief Minister Manjhi earlier used to speak allay-balayi, which sent a wrong message among the people
 sunne main aayaa he ki nitish ne bulaakar unhen samajhaayaa he
 The RJD leader clearly said that voters will evaluate the works of the current government and vote in the assembly elections, so it is necessary that better work is done by not leaving the remaining time
 vaishali kshetra ke purv saansad raghuvansh ne kaha ki mahagathbandhan ke netaa kaa chayan gathbandhan main shaamil sabhi dal milakar karenge
 Asked if Manjhi calls Nitish a leader, the RJD leader said, "JD (U) and Manjhi's leaders are Nitish Kumar, there is no point in arguing this
 lekin jahaan tak mahagathbandhan ke netaa kaa sawaal he, to yah sabhi ghatak dalon ke netaaon kii baithak ke baad hi tay hoga
 On the inclusion of three more mps from Bihar in the Union Cabinet, Raghuvansh said that all three mps have been made Ministers of State
 yah bihar ke saath anyaay he
 He said, 'three more mps of Bihar have been placed in the cabinet as a strategy keeping in mind the upcoming assembly elections, not for the development of Bihar
 ab dekhnaa he, modi ke ye mantri bihar main unke liye kya kar pate hai
 Nitish Kumar has set out on a public relations tour alone
 is vishay main puche jane par raghuvansh ne kaha ki isamen koi harj nahin he
 All the parties involved in the coalition have different programs
 sabhi ghatak dal majboot honge, tabhi gathbandhan bhi majboot hoga
 RJD is also doing its own program
 gauratlab he ki pichley loksabhaa chunaav main rajd ke chaar or jad (you) ke do ummidavaar vijayi hue the

 a new problem has arisen for former Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan
 chunaav ayog ne ped news ke ek maamle main kanoon ke mutabik apane chunavi kharche kii jaankaree dene main naakaam rahane par chavaan ko kaaran bataao notice jari kar unase poocha he ki unhen kyon na ayogy ghoshit kar diya jaae
 Giving 20 days to Chavan to reply to the notice, the commission said that he had failed to give details of the election expenditure as per the people's representative law and rules
 ' On the directions of the Supreme Court, the Election Commission last May issued a notice to Chavan to appear before the Commission in a matter related to his alleged election expenses during the 2009 Maharashtra Assembly elections
 ayog ne un kharche ko 'ped news' kaa maamla mana tha
 If Chavan is disqualified by the Election Commission, his current Lok Sabha membership could be affected, while the matter is related to his contesting in the assembly elections
 chunaav ayog ke aadesh main kaha gaya he ki janpratinidhitiv kanoon kii dhara 10 ke tahat ayog dwaara ayogy ghoshit kiya jane vaala koi ummidavaar agle teen saal tak na to sansad ke kisi sadan or na hi rajya vidhanmandal ke koi chunaav lard saktaa he
 According to the order, if such a candidate is already a member of a House, then he will not be a member of that House from the date of the Election Commission order
 chunaav ayog ke aadesh ke para 70 ke mutabik, 'lihaaja, 22 may 2014 ko maharashtra vidhansabha kii sadsyta se prativaadee ke istife kaa ayog main chal rahi kaarywahi par koi asar nahin padegaa or kisi taarkik nishkarsh tak pahunchane tak kaarywahi nirbaadh jari rahegi

 The bench reserved its decision on 19 June on this issue
 is sambandh main sampark kiye jane par maharashtra ke purv mukhyamantri ashok chavaan ne kaha ki vah notice dekhne ke baad uskaa jawaab denge

 company ne isaki keemat launch ke vakt 3,499 rupee rakhi thi
 However, it is being sold on Flipkart for Rs 2,999
 ise krom or flipcart se kharida ja saktaa he
 We have reviewed this smartwatch
 yahaan jaane ki kya aapako isamen paisa lagaana chahie?dizin or bild quality:lenovo ke is smartwatch kaa dizin fitbit Versa kii tarah yaa Apple watch siries kii tarah squaire shape vaala he
 Full body metal and 1 in front
 3-inch IPS color disple diya gaya he
 2 here
 5D karvd sarphase dizin he
 However, OLED display should have been given here for better colors
 strap rabar kaa he
 There will be two color options here, black and green
 iskaa disple tach besd nahin he
 There is a touch based sensor button to go to the menu here
 haalanki isaki kami ye he ki isse menu ko keval forverd kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, two physical buttons have been provided on its right panel, from which function controls such as select and on / off can be controlled
 saath hi aapako bataa den ye IP68 certyphoid he, yani ye waterpruf or dustpruf he
 Overall this smartwatch is quite lightweight and looks quite premium in terms of price
 parformens:ye smartwatch android or ios donon hi plateforms ko saport karata he
 Bluetooth V4 for connectivity in it
 2 ko diya gaya he
 Connecting this watch is quite easy
 keval aapako Lenovo Life ap store se downlod karnaa he or watch ko on kar aage kii prakriya apnaani he
 Once the watch is connected to the smartphone, Bluetooth is auto-connected to the phone when Bluetooth is on
 iskaa interphes bhi kaaphi aasaan he
 In this case, it can be used quite easily
 interphes kii baat karen to yahaan watch phase ke zyada opshan nahin he
 Here you get only three options
 ise badhaayaa ja saktaa tha
 Talking about the features of this watch, it has a heart rate monitor, sleep monitor and 8 sports modes for 24 hours
 in mods main skipping, badminton, basketbaal, footbal, swimming, walking, running or cycling shaamil he
 Also this weather also shows
 iske alaava yahaan ap or massej notification alert, kol alert or timer jaise fitures bhi milte hai
 All the statistics of functions like sports mode and sleep monitor can be seen in the app
 saath hi yahaan aap gol bhi set kar sakate hai
 However, we did not find the data in the step count correct
 ye dikkat baaki mods bhi ho sakati he, hamen saare mods main data record kar test nahin kiya he
 Apart from this, its heart rate monitor works better
 yahaan notification alert or kol alert bhi behatar tareeke se rispond karata he
 However, there is a problem that notifications in Hindi do not show clear-cut ways, there is a problem with the font
 isi tarah time or notification dekhne ke liye jescher feechar bhi kabhi-kabhi sahi se rispond nahin karata he
 In such a situation, you have to resort to physical buttons
 shaomi ke letest fitness trekar Mi Band 4 kii keemat 2,299 rupee he
 In comparison, the price of Xiaomi's fitness tracker is also low and in addition to the features present in Lenovo, some other features are also available
 isamen mukhya rup se mujeec control shaamil he
 In such a situation, we at least expected the music control feature in Lenovo Carme
 isi tarah shaomi ke fitness trekar main AMOLED disple bhi miltaa he or isaki bydaree life company ke daawey ke mutabik 20 dinon kii he
 However, i would like to say one thing that Lenovo Carme's look is quite attractive
 baharhaal Lenovo Carme ke bydaree parformens kii baat karen to iske liye company ne 7 dinon kii bydaree kaa daawa kiya tha
 We got 4-5 days of battery in regular use and on turning on the automatic heart rate monitor, this battery was limited to 4 days
 is watch phul charge karne main hamen lagbhag 1 ghante laga
 Verdict: Now the question is, should this new Lenovo smartwatch be invested? So the answer is that Xiaomi's fitness tracker Mi Band 4 is available for Rs 2,299 with some nice features
 lekin agar aap kuch fitures ke saath samjhauta kar ek good looking smartwatch bajet main khareednaa chaahate hai to isamen paisa laga sakate hai

 Maha Shivaratri is about to come and all the devotees get excited about this festival

 But have you ever thought what is the significance of this fast? What is the story behind this fast? Today, tell you the importance of this fast and the interesting story behind it
 vrath kaa mahatvamahashivaratri par vrath rakhane se aapke samast paap dur ho jate hai or aatma kii shuddhi hoti he
 It is believed that wherever Shiva lingam is installed on this day, Lord Shiva must arrive there
 agar mahashivaratri ke din sachhee shraddha se vrath kiya jaae to bhagwaan shiv aapke sabhi kashton kaa haran kar lete hai
 Let us tell you, Mahashivaratri fast is considered to be the most effective and beneficial fast
 vrath kii kathapracheen kaal main ek shikari jaanwaron kaa shikaar karke apane parivaar kaa paalan poshan karata tha
 But one day that hunter did not get a chance to hunt any animal
 ab kyonki uske parivaar kaa pet isi ke madhyam se bharta tha, to shikari bahut pareshaan ho gaya
 He began to fear that his entire family would have to sleep hungry
 raat hote- hote shikari thak gaya or jangal main sarovar ke paas chalaa gaya
 There he quenched his thirst and sat on a vine tree
 shikari ko puri aas thi ki ab is sarovar ke paas koi jaanavar to avashya aayega
 The water did not fall on the hunter's hopes jeen haa, thodi hi der main vahaan ek hirani ai
 Seeing the deer was not the place for the hunter's happiness
 usne turant apana dhanush nikaala or waar karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaya
 But due to this, some of the leaves of the tree fell on the Shivling lying down
 ab shikari is baat se avgat nahin tha ki us ped ke neeche ek shivlinga sthapit tha
 Hearing the sound of the leaves, Hirani became alert and said, 'don't kill me'
 lekin shikari uski baat ko nazarandaaj kar rahaa tha kyonki use apane parivaar kii bhukh mitaani thi
 Hearing this, Hirani assured that she would return by leaving her children to her master
 ye sun shikari pigal gaya or use jane diya
 After a while, another buck came to the lake
 ab usko dekh shikari ne phirase apana tir kaman nikaal liya
 As the tree got pushed, the leaves of the vine fell on the Shivling
 is prakaar shikari kii duusare prahar kii upasna bhi ho gai
 Now looking at the hunter, Hirani pleaded for mercy and requested him not to kill her
 lekin phirase shikari ne uski dayaa yachana ko khaarich kar diya
 Seeing this, Hirani said, 'hunter, the person who does not follow his word, all the virtues of his life are destroyed
 vishwaas rakho, mai jarur waapas aaungi '
 Now the hunter also let this reindeer go
 ab do hiraniyon ko chhod dene ke baad shikari ko laga aaj uskaa parivaar bhookha pet hi soyega
 But then a deer arrived
 pehle kii tarah shikari ne apana tir kaman nikaala or nishane saadhane laga
 In the process, some Belpatras fell on the Shivalinga and the worship of its third Prahar was also completed
 is hiran ne ab shikari se dayaa yachika nahin kii, balki kaha kii ye uskaa saubhaahgya he ki wo kisi ke pet kii bhukh ko shant kar paaegaa
 But he said that he would first leave his children to his mother
 shikari ne us hiran par vishwaas kiya or use jane diya
 After some time the hunter noticed that all the deer are moving towards him
 unhe dekh shikari ne apana dhanush nikaal liya or uski chauthe prahar kii puja bhi sampan ho gai
 Now because his worship of Shiva was complete, his heart changed
 shikari ko is baat kii aatmaglani hui ki wo in bejubaan jaanwaron kaa shikaar kar apane parivaar kaa paalan poshan karata he
 He asked all the deer to return
 shikari ke aisa kehete hi bhagwaan shiv kaa divya rup prakat hua or unhone us shikari ko yash, vaibhav or khyaati kaa arshivaad diya
 So the essence of this story is that if you worship Shiva with a sincere heart, then Bhole Baba will take away all your sorrows and always maintain your blessings

 Mishra told the bench that Babur had not gone to Ayodhya and therefore had no opportunity to order the demolition of the temple in 1528 and the construction of the mosque
 iske alaava, mir baaqi naam kaa koi vyakti uskaa commander nahin tha
 The bench also consists of Justice SA Bobde, Justice DY Chandrachud, Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice SA Najer

 He said that our temple should be declared a mosque
 " unhone kaha, "agar kisi imaarat ko masjid ghoshit kiya janaa he to unhen yah sabit karnaa hoga ki babar vahaan se waakif tha
 "mishra said that Baburnama deals with 18 years of the emperor's life, but does not mention any mosque in Ayodhya
 iske alaava jab tathakthith masjid kaa nirmaan karne kaa aadesh diya gaya tha, us samay badshaah raja agra main tha
 Mishra said, "A man can lie, but circumstances do not lie
 " unhone kaha ki babar ne avadh ke muslim shaasha ibrahim lodi ko parajeet kiya or uski hatya kar di or phir uske bhai ko kshetra kaa commander bana diya
 He said that the Muslims here said that Mir was the commander of the rest of Babur which is wrong

 unhone kaha ki lekin is kitaab main ayodhya main kisi masjid ke hone kaa zikr nahin he
 Mishra said that it was established that the mosque was built not by Babur but by Aurangzeb and that he had demolished temples in Mathura and Kashi
 unhone kaha ki divaani maamle main yah prativaadee kaa kartavya he ki vah vaadi kii yachika ko asaty pramanit kare
 The lawyer said that he is seeking to dismiss the case on the wrong arguments

 Habib Wali Mohammed was born in 1924 in a Memon family settled in Rangoon
 baad main unka parivaar mumbai chalaa aayaa
 Habib loved Qawwali very much
 unhone clasical mujeec kii shuruaati talim ustad latafat hossain se lee
 During his graduation from Ismail Yusuf College in Mumbai, his tone was so tight that people started calling him Tansen
 saal 1941 main mumbai main naujavaanon kaa ek mujeec muqabla hua
 1200 people participated in it
 habib ne mukesh jaise kai yuvaaon ko peeche chhodkar awwal jagah hasil kii
 Later Habib went to Pakistan singing Ghazal and here Mukesh achieved a distinct feat in the film world
 is mujeec mukaable kii baat karen to zikr laazmi he aakhri mughal badshaah bahadur shah jafar kaa
 Habib sang the ghazal written by Zafar ‘lagte hain hai ji mera ujde daayar mein’
 magar unka parivaar gane bajaane ke bajaay padhai ko ahmiyat dene kaa himachati tha
 As a result, Habib lost his hobby for some time
 jis saal mulk aaazaad hua
 Habib received an MBA degree from a university in New York
 isi dauraan unhone ghazal kaa ek record nikaala
 It had Ghazals written by Bahadur Shah Zafar on one side and Ghalib written on the other side
 public main is record kaa shuruaati asar maddhim tha
 But once daily, famous actress Meena Kumari heard these ghazals
 us vakt vah radio ceylone se judi hui thim
 So this radio station broadcast a lot of Habib's ghazals
 aise main habib ke record kii bikri main to ijapha hona hi thi
 His family left India and moved to Pakistan in 1947 in connection with the business
 habib bhi parivaar or kaarobaar kii khatir 10 baras baad pakistan main hi jam gaye
 His family is counted among the old business dynasties of Pakistan
 shalimaar silk mil kii milkiyat unheen ke paas he
 His brother Ashraf Tabani also climbed many ranks in politics
 benazir bhutto kii aamad ke vakt yani saal 1988 main vah sindh ke governor bhi rahe
 The Habib family later settled in the state of California, USA
 3 sitambar 2014 ko los angeles main unka nidhan ho gaya
 Habib never adopted Ghazal singing very aggressively and professionally
 magar jitna bhi gaaya, kya khub gaaya
 And for this he was also awarded the prestigious Nigar Award of Pakistan
 suniye habib kii jindagi unheen kii jubanihabib ke sur kaa sammohan samajhane ke liye ye raheen kuch gajalen or geet
 It is special not to insist on going today
 faiyaz hashmi kii is ghazal ko zyaadaatar log farida khanam kii aawaaj ke jariye hi sunate hai
 But along with Farida, Habib also had a hand in sparing it immortality
 in donon ne hi ise ek film ke liye sabase pehle gaaya
 The melody was Yemen Kalyan
 suniye aaj jane kii jid na karo kaa pehla varjan
 i do not think that my destructive heart was falling apart, our luck was not there bhartiya janata party ke netaa or purv vidhayak surendranath singh urf mamma kaa ek video in dinon viral ho rahaa he
 In this video, Surendranath Singh is seen making controversial statements and openly threatening to bleed on the streets
 reports ke mutabik unka ye video bhopal main pradarshan ke dauraan kaa he
 Where he made conflicting statements
 video main surendra nath singh khuleam sadakon par khun bahaane kii dhamkee dete dikh rahe hai
 During the protest against the Congress outside the assembly in Bhopal, when the public said that the blood will flow on the streets, the former MLA said and 'that blood will be Kamal Nath'
 darasal, rajdhani bhopal main pichley dinon nagar nigam ne shahar ke alag-alag ilaakon main atikaraman virdohi muhim chalaa kar avaidh gumtiyon ko hataaya tha
 BJP leader Surendranath Singh gheraoed the assembly with the same gossipers
 is dauraan rangmahal chauraahey ke paas virodh pradarshan ke dauraan surendranath singh ne bade hue bijli ke bilon ko lekar bhi sarkaar or bijli companiyon par jamkar hallaa bolaa
 Surendranath Singh told the crowd present during this period that if the bill comes too much, do not pay it and if the officials come to disconnect the connection from the power company, then beat them up
 surendranath yaheen nahin ruke
 He said that if there is no electricity, they will all enter the Vallabh Bhavan
 bijepi netaa surendranath jab bheed ko uksaa rahe the to us dauraan bheed ne chillaanaa shuru kiya 'khun bahegaa sadakon par' jiske jawaab main purv vidhayak surendranath singh ne kaha 'or wo khun kamalnath kaa hoga'
 At the same time, after the statement provoking the crowd, former MLA Surendranath Singh's difficulties may increase because an FIR has been registered against the government officials at TT Nagar police station in Bhopal for inciting the mob

 The SP said, Akhilesh's intention is clearly a result of the ruling Samajwadi Party (SP) that this success is the result of Chief Minister Akhilesh's prudence, skill to coordinate better and clear intentions

 Demand for Mayawati Unsunimayavati had demanded a package of about 80 thousand crore rupees for the all-round development of the state as soon as she came to power in Uttar Pradesh in the year 2007
 saal dar saal guzarate gaye lekin centre ne package kii maang ko manjuur nahin kiya
 Mayawati held several rallies during this period and accused the then United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government of the Center of adopting step-motherly behavior

 'BSP told Congress' anti-dalit '
 On the other hand, BSP national general secretary Swami Prasad Maurya said,' During bsp's rule, Behenji had demanded Rs 80,000 crore as a separate package for all-round development of Uttar Pradesh, But during five years, the Congress ignored it

 At the same time, the Sunni Central Waqf Board said that no temple ever existed in the place where the mosque was built
 masjid khaali zamin par banaai gai
 However, the question was still unresolved as to who owned the land before the dispute between the temple and the mosque started? Whether there was a Ram temple on the disputed land of Ayodhya? Revenue department records could become important evidence in resolving this quarrel
 lekin pench isi baat se ulajhaa tha ki revenue record main vivaadit zamin ke malikana haq kaa koi byora nahin tha
 The Nirmohi Arena had submitted its arguments about the ownership
 udhar vakf board kaa kahana tha ki zamin par masjid babar ne banavaai or ab ye vakf kii property he

 a post shared by Team India (@indiancricketteam) on Oct 27, 2018 at 5:25am PDT The ongoing deadlock in West Bengal was expected to be resolved on Saturday night when agitating doctors said they were ready to hold talks with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to end the agitation, but they would decide the place of meeting later
 isse pehle shaam main unhone rajya sachivalay main banerjee ke saath baithak ke prastaav ko thukraa diya tha or isaki bajaae unase gatirodh sulajhane ko lekar khuli charchaa ke liye enares medical college aspataal aane ko kaha tha
 a joint conference of junior doctors called a press conference late Saturday night
 forum ke pravaktaa ne kaha ki ham hameshaa se baatcheet ke liye taiyaar hai
 If the Chief Minister extends one hand, we will extend our 10 hands
 
 We are eagerly awaiting the end of this deadlock
 pradarshnarat doctoron ne kaha ki ve baithak ke liye prastaavit sthaan ko lekar apane sanghathan ke faisle kaa intjaar karenge
 Amid the ongoing doctors' strike in West Bengal, CM Mamata Banerjee held a press conference on Saturday evening and appealed to the doctors to return to work
 unhone kaha ki ham kisi tarah kaa bal prayog nahin kar rahe hai
 Have agreed to all the demands
 doctoron ko sadabuddhi mili
 He said that the government office is the best place to talk to a person sitting on a constitutional post
 aapako bataa den ki ye puraa maamla us vaqt shuru hua tha jab is hafte somvaar der raat ek dil ke mariz kii heart atake se maut ho jane par unke parijanon ne 2 junior doctoron kii jamkar pitayee kar di thi
 In which he was seriously injured
 iske baad suraksha ke liye sashastr police bal kii maang karte hue kolkata main doctor mangalvaar se hadtaal par chale gaye
 'biwi mange more' is this jumla for the law being made in the country, which if implemented, will increase many complications
 shaadi kii sharton se lekar talaak tak tamaam pahalu pechida ho jaaenge
 There is talk of an amendment in the Hindu Marriage Act, on which the Cabinet could not take any decision
 yani nae praavdhaan ko lekar sarkaar main bhi antarvirodh he, to phir sarkaar is sanshodhan par kyon tuli hui he
 Consensus is not being formed between the government
 The country's law ministry started this debate, but a consensus is not being formed among the government
 masalaa he shaadi tuutane ke baad mahilaon ke haq kii
 The Law Minister of the country wants women to have a share in her ancestral property with her husband after divorce
 lekin is sifarish par antarvirodh andar or baahar jari he
 After the divorce, a cabinet meeting was called on the question of getting the husband's ancestral rights to the wives
 baithak main kanoon mantri ne apana paksh rakhaa
 When the discussion started, many ministers like Ghulam Nabi Azad, Kapil Sibal, Kamal Nath and even Krishna Tirath opposed it
 kahin khatre main naa pad jaae parivaar kaa vajood?cabinet ke antarvirodh ko chindbaram ne bhale hi sadhe hue lahaze main bayaan kar diya
 But the matter is not so simple
 hindu marij act main sanshodhan ke bahaane kanoon mantri bhale hi mahilaon ko zyada haq dilaane kii vakaalat karte hon, lekin cabinet ke kai sadasyon ko dar he ki kahi is praavdhaan se parivaar kaa vajood hi khatre main nahin pad jaae
 Like cabinet ministers, many kinds of apprehensions are also evident from the placards of the people performing
 sanshodhan kaa virodh kar rahe seve da femily foundation kii najar main nayaa kanoon patni-patni or parivaar nuksaan pahunchane vaala he
 In Rajya Sabha, objections to the amendment to the Strict Billhindu Marriage Act have arisen since the preparation of its blueprint
 khaastaur par pati ke pushtaini jaaydaad par patni ke haq ko lekar
 However, this bill has been passed in the Lok Sabha only last year
 lekin rajyasabha main ye kanoon bich bahes main funs gaya
 On the opinion of the mps, the Rajya Sabha sent it to the Standing Committee
 bill par bani sansad kii sthai samiti ne kaha ki pati kii pushtaini jaaydaad main mahilaon ko hissaa milanaa chahie
 a cabinet meeting led by the Prime Minister was called to consider the same recommendation
 lekin aam raay nahin ban saki
 The meeting of the cabinet on the amendment ended unabated
 amrai nahin banane ke baad ise jioem yani mantriyon ke samooh ko bhej diya gaya he
 The proposed amendments to the two ministry face to face on the matter have been passed in the Lok Sabha, but after being stuck in the Rajya Sabha, it was sent to the cabinet for consideration
 lekin yahaan bhi sahmati nahin bani
 Now this bill will go to the Group of Ministers
 isse pehle hi ise lekar vivaad khadaa ho gaya he
 There is a dispute about the loss of marriage and family structure after the enactment of this law
 bahes ke mudde kai tamaam he, magar har sawaal par jawaab alag-alag
 The reason for the dissolution of the cabinet meeting if the disagreement over the bill remained
 kanoon mantralay kii daleel he ki talaak ke baad patni ko pati ke shaadi yaa shaadi se pehle arjeet kii gai jaaydaad main hissaa milanaa chahie
 With this, the wife should also get a share in the husband's ancestral property
 isapar mahila env bal vikaas mantralay kii daleel he ki pati kii pushtaini jaaydaad se us property ko alag rakhaa jaae, jo shaadi se pehle kharidi gai ho
 The structure of the family will be affected, but the question is not only about the definition of ancestral property, but also many other complexities
 isse sabase pehle prabhavit hoga parivaar kaa dhaancha, jabaki talaak kaa masalaa sidhe taur par pati-patni ke bich kaa he
 Experts contend that if the ancestral property is divided in several parts in the dispute between the husband and wife, then the parents will not win their property in the name of children
 nae praavdhaan kaa doosraa khatra he talaak kii ghatnaon main badhottaree kaa
 In the eyes of experts, till now mutual disputes have become the reason for divorce, but after the new law, the share of property can become a big reason
 aisi raay sarkaar ke andar hi kai logon kii he
 The opposition's attitude about this is also not seen in support
 inaki najar main is kanoon ke jariye sarkaar logon ko asal mudde se bhatakaane kii koshish main he
 Opponents argue those opposing Shakabil on the government's intent, that if the government's intention were clear, it could have made the terms of the divorce more stringent
 halaat ke mutabik mahilaon ko muaavje kii raashi badhaane kii sifarish kar sakati thi
 According to the provision so far in the Hindu Marriage Act, after the divorce, the wife gets half of the husband's property
 iske alaava guzar basar ke liye nakad muaavje kaa praavdhaan he
 Which government wants to find a solution by adding ancestral property to it
 jo kanoon mantralay is bill kii vakaalat kar rahaa he, use bhi pataa he, pushtaini jaaydaad par haq ko lekar alag kanoon he
 The father is followed by ancestral property followed by sons and daughters
 aise main bahuon kii hissedari se jaaydaad kii jang main ek nayaa pech or jud jayega
 The government will also have to keep this aspect in mind before drafting the bill
 hindu marij act he kya?shaadiyon ko kanoonee shart main baandhan ke liye hindu marriage act bana tha
 This is in 1955, 8 years after independence
 tab se lekar is act main kai tamaam sanshodhan hue- lekin ise lekar sarkaar kaa aisa antarvirodh shaayad hi saamne aayaa
 This time the government's efforts are being criticized everywhere
 vipaksh to vipaksh saamaajik sanghathan bhi sarkaar kii manshaa kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 The saying in our tradition is that weddings are fixed in heaven
 ise nibaahane ke liye 7 pheron ke 7 vachan hi kaaphi hai
 But this ease of changing times has been filled with many intricacies
 inhen pechidagiyon se bachane ke liye liye samvidhan main hindu marij act kaa pravaadhan kiya gaya tha
 The Hindu Marriage Act was enacted in 1955 to prevent marriages from breaking up and tie it into legal terms
 magar tuutate bikharate rishton kaa alam aaj ye he, ki court ko bhi act ko lacheela bananaa padaa
 If there is no scope to save any marriage, if the husband and wife both agree to break the relationship, then divorce can be granted even before the 6-month 'cooling period'
 desh kii oonchi adaalat ne ye faisla to ek nijee maamle main dipha tha
 But this decision indicates how much the spontaneity of getting rid of the suffocation of relationships has increased over time
 isi ke saath hindu marij act main sanshodhano bhi kiye jate rahe hai
 For example, in the original law, the marriage age for boys was 18 years and for girls 15 years, which was later reduced to 21 years and 18 years
 pehle hindu reeti rivaajon se hui shaadi ko maanya mana jaataa tha, aage chalakar isamen kanoonee panjikaran kaa pravaadhan kiya gaya
 The terms of the divorce were also changed
 talaak ke baad biviyon ko muaavje kaa khyaal rakhaa gaya
 But till now, there has not been much hue and cry about any amendment
 lekin is baar praavdhaan kuch or he or iske baad banane vaale kanoon ko lekar bhi ashankaayen bhi badi he

 India's senior batsman Rahul Dravid said that he did not ask the umpire for a referral during the second innings in the third Test match against England, as he was confused as to where the slightest sound came from
 unhone kaha ki haalanki unhen pakkaa vishwaas tha ki gend unke balle kaa chhukar nahin gai he
 In India's second innings at Edgbaston, Dravid was caught out behind the wicket off James Anderson
 tab gend ne unke balle ko nahin chuaa tha, balki vah unke juute ke feeton se laga tha
 Dravid said he trusted umpire Simon Taufel instead of himself and his partner Sachin Tendulkar standing on the non-striker
 in donon kaa maananaa tha ki vah out hai
 At no point did he think that his bat was tied with shoes
 dravid ne kaha, meraa pehla vichaar yahi tha ki maine gend hit nahin kii he
 But there was a very loud sound and i could not find out where it came from
 main jaanata tha ki maine maidan yaa pad yaa juute ko hit nahin kiya he, isliye main asamanjas main tha ki dhwani kahaan se nikali he
 i did not know that the bat was attached to my shoes
 unhone daily telegraph ko die intervyuu main kaha, isliye maine apane saathi se poocha or usne kaha ki tej aawaaj nikali he
 That's why Simon Tuffel, one of the world's best umpires, called me out
 mere saathi ne kaha ki main out hum or maine khud aawaaj suni he
 i thought it might be one of those two sentences when i didn't think the ball hit the edge of the bat
 dravid ne kaha ki yadi unhone refral ke liye kaha hota to bharat behatar sthiti main hota
 India lost that match by an innings and 242 runs
 unhone kaha, yah niraashajanak tha, kyonki main acchhee ballebaaji kar rahaa tha or yadi main sachin ke saath lambii saajhedaari nibhaataa or yadi ham lunch se pehle anderson kaa spel khel lete to ham acchhee chunauti pesh karte
 At the same time, Dravid also praised the fast attack of England
 unhone kaha, kai kaarnon se yah kadi shrunkhlaa rahi
 The pitches are helping swing bowlers immensely and England's bowling is excellent

 In fact, for a long time it was seen that people used to write the name of the village, whereabouts and caste on trains to show their dominance
 kuch log koi sanghathan banaate the to sanghathan kaa naam apni gaadi par likh lete the
 Due to writing such things, there was a problem in identifying the number of vehicles, due to which the police have taken this step

 usne pehle somani ko dhakka dekar giraaya or phir unpar thappadon kii barsaat kar di
 Ojha also abused the elder
 bujurg kii umr kaa bhi koi dhyaan nahin rakhaa gaya
 According to Radheshyam, when he reached the Rajendra Nagar police station to complain about the incident, he was threatened to send the report in another case, instead of sending him away

 The officer has also warned that if any party and leader violates the code, then the Election Commission will take strict action against him
 shahar ke saini ramlila maidan main ravivaar ko aam aadmi party kaaryakartaaon kii sabha hui thi
 Many activists participated in it
 jila chunaav adhikari ko sambandh main pataa chalane ke baad ki aap ke chunavi kaarykram ko lekar prashasan se koi anumati nahin lee thi to unhone party ko notice bheja
 Confirming this, District Election Officer Rajeev Ratan said that the Aam Aadmi Party has held an election without permission, which is a violation of the code of conduct
 aise main unhen notice bheja gaya he
 Before the Lok Sabha elections in the capital Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party has intensified the demand for full statehood
 south dilli ke badarpur ilaake main shuukravaar ko jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki 1947 main desh azaad hua tha or bharat main janatantr aayaa tha
 Democracy means the rule of the people where the public votes and chooses the government
 wo sarkaar janata ke hisaab se kaam karti he
 Democracy arrived in the whole country but did not come to Delhi
 dilli main aap vot daalate hai or sarkaar chunate hai, lekin sarkaar kii power kuch nahin he
 All the power belongs to the central government
 1947 se pehle sari power angrezon kii thi aaj sari power centre sarkaar kii he
 Kejriwal also questioned PM Modi and Congress for not fulfilling the promise of a full state
 unhone kaha, 70 saal se dilli ke log kah rahe hai ki hamen purna rajya kaa darja chahie
 The Congress said that they will give full state status but they did not give full state status even when the government is at the center
 modi ji ne khud aakar dilli ke logon ko kaha tha ki saaton seat mil jane par wo dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja denge lekin pradhanmantri banane ke baad wo bhul gaye
 AAP has its chance in this Lok Sabha election
 jansabha ke dauraan mukhyamantri janata se sawaal poochhate nazar aae
 He said, i want to ask why there is dirt in Delhi, why is there no cleanliness while Delhi is the capital of the country? There is no sanitation in Delhi as the MCD is under the central government
 main pradhanmantri se kahana chahta hum pakistan sanbhaalo, MCD dilli ko de do
 DDA was made to give home to every man of Delhi, but DDA is not building a house for Delhiites, but instead of meeting the builder, it has become a den of corruption
 DDA bhi pradhanmantri ke under main he
 Kejriwal said that why is sealing happening in Delhi? Because the DDA did not build shops all over Delhi
 kachi coloniyon main log rahane ke liye majaboor hai, kyonki DDA ne ghar nahin banaae
 That too does not come under the people of Delhi but under the Modi government
 arvind kejariwal ne logon ko bataaya ki jaise haryana main puri sarkaar he, jaise punjab main puri sarkaar he, maharashtra main puri sarkaar he ab time aa gaya he ki 70 saal ke baad dilli ke logon ko bhi apni puri sarkaar chahie
 Kejriwal, referring to the problem of not being a full-fledged state, said that today he has an accident with a Delhiwale, a theft or something wrong with women, then he goes to the Delhi Police who listens to him No, they go to the MLA who does not have police under him, then he goes to the Chief Minister who has no power over the police
 ab police pradhanmantri ke under aati he lekin kya log pradhanmantri se mil sakate hai?kejariwal ne kaha ki agar dilli purna rajya bane to mahilaon ko suraksha milegi
 Theft robberies will be less and if Delhi becomes a full state then Delhi will shine
 arvind kejariwal ne daawa kiya ki jis din dilli purna rajya banegi, wo 10 saal ke andar har parivaar ko pakkaa ghar banavaakar denge or sabhi kachche karmchaariyon ko pakkaa bhi karenge
 Former Union Minister MM Pallam Raju lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 unhone kaha ki 2014 main piem modi ne shuruyaat vikaas kii baat se kii, lekin ab vah main, meraa zyada karte hai or unke liye sabakuch unase chota ho chukaa he
 Therefore, parties across the country want that the other option be put before the people of the country
 pallam raju india today ke conklev south 2018 ke ahm satr deveopment and aaidentity- di future of voting main shirkat kar rahe the
 Pallam Raju said that in 2008, we had waived the farmer loan of 72 thousand crores
 yah koi chunaav main kiya gaya vaada nahin tha, lekin hamane kisaanon ko fori raahat dene kii koshish kii
 But farmers are helpless in the current NDA government
 unke liye modi sarkaar kii ore se koi kadam nahin uthaae ja rahe hai
 During this session, BJP spokesperson Krishna Sagar Rao said that when Owaisi's party in Telangana shifts its vote bank to TRS, it is called secular and when BJP asks for votes among the people of the country, it becomes communal is
 vipaksh kaa yah doharaa ravaiya he
 Responding to this, Congress leader Khushboo said that BJP has been upset with Rahul Gandhi for the past few years
 bijepi rahul ke har kadam ko dekh rahi he or aalochana kar rahi he
 BJP is more concerned about what Rahul eats, what he wears, which temple he visits and what his caste is
 unhone kaha ki hamen apni galtiyaan pataa hai or ham ise swikar karne main hichakate nahin hai
 We have a strong alliance with the DMK in Tamil Nadu

 Lal Krishna Advani has agreed to take back the resignation
 ab sawaal unki bhoomika kaa he
 BJP has chosen its path
 party ko modi main apana leader najar aane laga he
 In such a situation, what will Advani do for the party? Will he leave the temptation for the post of PM and play the role of a guide? The question of how Advani has softened has also raised many questions? Did he really worry about the party's image? Or did they understand that after the pressure of the Sangh, u turn on Modi is no longer possible for the party? Or did they have to fear fear of anonymity in politics? Or there is some other middle path between the party and Advani, in which there is scope for both rank and honor
 adwani ke naram padane ke sanket dopaher main hi milane shuru ho gaye the
 The enthusiasm of the party leaders was telling that now everything will be alright
 somvaar ko subah 11 baje adwani ne party ke tamaam padon se apana istipha bhejkar bijepi main hadakamp machaa diya tha
 As soon as the resignation was received, a series of tough faces including party presidents started to appear on Advani's frame
 sabhi netaa party ke adwani viheen hone kii pidaa jataane kii koshish karte najar aae
 On one hand, there was a lot of manhood and on the other side the party was not ready to compromise with its decision
 sangh ke dabaav main modi ke mudde par you turn kii gunjaaish khatm ho chuki thi
 The party president also made it clear that Modi himself has been blessed by Advani, and he has been given the command of the Election Committee with the consent of everyone, then where is the scope to go back to this decision
 duusari taraf adwani kii naaraazgi ke centre bane modi apane kaam main vyast the
 He had done the formalities of persuading Advani over the phone on Monday
 mangalvaar din main kisaanon kii sabha ko sambodhit karte hue wo apane naishanal agenda main jute rahe
 When questions related to Advani were also fired there, he ignored it

 Grandmaster Vishwanathan Anand said that by winning his fourth World Chess Championship title this month, he proved his critics wrong who accuse him of lacking a 'killer instinct'

 The Congress on Tuesday criticized the opposition for disrupting the Lok Sabha's proceedings, not discussing the Food Security Bill and not allowing it to pass, saying the opposition was harming the poor for political selfishness
 kendriya sansadeey kaarymantri kamalnath ne khaas taur par bhartiya janata party (BJP) par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki vah vidheyak ko paarit nahin hone dena chaahati, jabaki anya vipakshi partiyon ko vidheyak se koi aapatti nahin he
 Kamal Nath said, 'BJP says on one side that it wants to discuss the Land Acquisition Bill and the Food Security Bill, because they are historical bills
 duusari ore vah sadan kii kaarywahi ko baadhit karti he
 'he said,' Other political parties want to debate the bill and pass it
 sirf bijepi hi pareshaani khadi kar rahi he
 It is very unfortunate that the BJP is not saying what it is saying outside the House
 jo kuch bhi usne tivi studio main kaha he, use vah sadan main bhi kah sakati thi, jiskaa sarkaar jawaab de sakati thi
 Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari had earlier said that a particular section of the opposition wants to eradicate hunger rather than hunger by hanging the Food Security Bill
 unhone bijepi kii ore ishaara karte hue kaha, 'desh ke 67 fisadi logon ko khaadya suraksha dene vaala vidheyak raajnneetik avasarvadita kii bhent chadh rahaa he
 The major component of the opposition is hunger for its political selfishness and harming the poor
 'kendriya sansadeey rajya mantri rajeev shukla ne kaha ki vipaksh ko kam se kam ek din ke liye sadan chalane dena chahie taaki vidheyak par bahes ho sake

 The locals called the police after which Oliver was taken to the Trauma Center in AIIMS but could not be saved

 The complaint by the villagers showed that they had a lot of objection to the lifestyle of African citizens
 der raat tak sangeet sunanaa
 Partying and waking up
 samskruti or vyavhaar ko lekar shikaayat sirf africa nagarikon se nahin rahi he, dakshin dilli ke gaanvon ke sthaneey logon kii purvottar ke kiraayedaaron se bhi yahi shikaayatein hai
 Around 4000 Northeast tenants live in Munirka in South Delhi

 He said that these people live eight to ten people in a room, so we get more rent
 bahut se log kaaphi achche hai
 But when we are up late in the night, playing loud music and many times getting drunk, then we do not understand how to interfere in their mutual affairs
 bhagwaan dev ne do saal pehle muniraka main hui ek panchayat main saaf saaf kaha tha ki ham logon ko kisi ko bhi chinki, nepali yaa madrasi nahin kahana chahie
 They are all citizens of India
 hamaare kiraayedaar hai jinase hamaara kharchaa chalata he lekin kuch asamaajik tatv hai un par nazar rakhni hogi
 This initiative of Lord Dev is quite right that no one in Munirka would call them Chinki Nepali or the tenants of the south as Madrasi
 shekhar tokes ek sthaneey naagarik hai
 He says that the dialogue is growing
 ham log bhi jeenyu ke professor kii yahaan sabha karaate hai
 Thousands of leaflets have been distributed

 The problem is when a culture claims a new culture

 These are the same clothing shops whose wear makes the local people see their culture in danger

 You can make all arrangements from here to dinner and from here to there

 Minister of State for External Affairs VK Singh has said in a tweet that, 'discussed with Delhi Police

 VK Singh forgot that when the Congo youth was killed, angry African ambassadors refused to attend the India Africa Friendship Program
 baad main sab saamaanya ho gaya or ye kaarykram hua
 It also reacted in Congo
 26 may ko videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa vikaas swaroop ne bataaya ki congou main kuch bharatiyon kii dukaanon par hamale hue hai or kuch bhartiya bandook kii goli se ghayal bhi hue hai
 The incident may have occurred in response to the murder of a Congo student in Delhi
 vahaan par bharatiyon se dukaane band karne ke liye kah diya gaya
 Now the case is cool
 tippaniyan It is better that we do not consider these incidents as minor
 yah bhi sahi he ki maamuli kahasuni hoti rahati he lekin yah samajhnaa hoga ki jati se lekar nasl ke naam par hinsa kii baaten galat nahin hai
 President of India Pranab Mukherjee has also issued a statement on these incidents
 pranab mukherjee ne kaha, 'africa deshon ke saath hamaare qareebi sambandh rahe hai
 Mahatma Gandhi first used Satyagraha on the land of Africa which changed our country
 isliye ham kaise ise sahan kar sakate hai
 How can we even think like that? kya africa logon ko bharat main surakshit mahasoos nahin karnaa chahie
 i am glad that the Government of India took immediate steps
 main grih mantralay ke saath milakar kii gai videsh mantralay kii pahal kaa swaagat karata hum
 ' 20 may shuukravaar kii aadhi raat se thik pehle jab masonda kentanda oliver 24 saal kaa hone vaala tha, tabhi vasant kunj ke ilaake main autoricshaw thik karne ko lekar kuch logon se kahasuni ho gai
 Oliver and his friend were returning from a friend's house in Kishangarh area of vasant Kunj
 auto rickshaw pahunchaa to oliver se pehle teen log usamen baith gaye
 After that there was an argument and a quarrel erupted
 oliver ne bhaagane kii koshish kii to teenon logon ne 20-25 meter tak uskaa peechha kiya or use pattharon se bhi maaraa
 When the locals came to help, they killed them too
 is bich oliver ke dost ne hallaa kiya or aasapaas rahane vaale anya africa mul ke logon ko bulaayaa
 But the accused escaped from the scene
 sthaneey logon ne police ko bulaayaa jiske baad oliver ko ames ke troma centre le jaaya gaya lekin use bachaaya nahin ja sakaa
 Oliver came to India on a student visa in 2012 and was teaching French at an institution
 congou ke saadhaaran parivaar kaa ladkaa tha, itnaa saadhaaran ki maa baap ke paas paise nahin hai ki apane bete ke shav ko apane vatan le jaaen
 The Government of India has said that all arrangements are being made to take Olivir's body to his house
 oliver ke mitra ne kaha ki use naslbhedi gaaliyaan di gai hai
 Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj showed immediate activism at her level as soon as this incident came to light
 dilli ke up rajyapal, grahamantri se baat kii
 Police has also arrested a youth named Mobin Azad
 mobin azaad ke do saathi mukesh or prakaash faraar hai
 After this, some incidents have also been reported from Rajpur Khurd and Maidan Garhi in South Delhi
 police kahati he ye nasli hinsa nahin he
 The Government of India has taken all these incidents very seriously
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne ravivaar ko videsh rajya mantri ve ke singh or sachiv amar sinha ko bhi maukey par bheja
 The police officers held a meeting with the villagers and heard and understood the views of both sides
 yah bhi dekha gaya ki kuch maamalon main africa nagarikon kii bhi galati thi
 Talk with a minor argument reached a quarrel
 gaanvon waalon ne jo shikaayat kii usase pataa chalaa ki unhen africa nagarikon kii jivan style se kaaphi aitaraaz he
 Listening to music till late at night
 party karnaa or jaagnaa
 Complaints about culture and behavior have not just been from African citizens, the local people of villages in South Delhi have the same complaints from the tenants of the Northeast
 dakshin dilli ke muniraka main kareeb 4000 purvottar ke kiraayedaar rahete hai
 Often a collision occurs with them
 gaanv waalon ko lagata he ki aisa jab bhi hota he police yaa media unki nahin sunata he isliye logon ne apane paise se muniraka main kareeb 200 sisitivi camere laga rakhe hai
 We spoke to Bhagwan Dev, President of Resident Welfare Association
 unhone kaha ki ye log ek kamare main aath das log rahete hai isliye hamen kiraaya zyaada miltaa he
 Many people are quite good
 lekin jab der raat tak hangaamaa karte hai, tej sangeet bajaate hai or kai baar sharaab ke nashe main hangaamaa karte milte hai to ham samaj nahin pate ki inke aapas ke maamle main ham kaise hastkshep karen
 In a panchayat held in Munirka two years ago, Lord Dev had clearly said that we should not call anyone Chinki, Nepali or Madrasi
 ye sabhi bharat ke naagarik hai
 We have tenants from whom our expenses are incurred but there are some anti-social elements that have to be tracked
 bhagwaan dev kii yah pahal to kaaphi thik he ki muniraka main koi inhen chinki nepali yaa dakshin ke kiraayedaaron ko madrasi nahin kahegaa
 Shekhar Tokas is a local citizen
 unka kahana he ki samvaad bad rahaa he
 We also hold a meeting of JNU professor here
 hazaron parche baant chuke hai
 It is also a better way that people from both cultures get to know each other
 samasya tab he ki jab ek samskruti nai samskruti par daavedaari kare
 It is good that both give equal space
 baat africa se judi he lekin purvottar kii ghatnaon kaa zikr isliye kiya kyonki donon ek duusare se jude hue hai
 If we add these issues only with color then it will not be right
 dilli police kii north east cell ke fasebuk pej par pantis hazaar likes hai
 Nido Tanya was killed in Lajpat Nagar in 2014
 tab kaaphi hangaamaa hua tha
 a court order created a helpline 1093 for the people of the North East
 videshi nagarikon ke liye bhi bani
 The Delhi Police was asked to construct the North East Cell, whose office is in Nanakpura
 vartmaan main rahin hibu iske joint seepi hai
 But it is not that these events have not reduced the distance between Munirka and Northeast
 is gaanv ke logon kaa kamaal kahie ki kuch baton ko lekar shikaayat to he magar unhone muniraka ke bheetar puraa kaa puraa manipur yaa kahen to purvottar bharat basane diya he
 Every other shop from Anupam Restaurant to Babulal Chowk now belongs to the people of the Northeast
 kiraaye kii dukaan he magar dukandaar vahi hai
 There were many incidents of confrontation around Babulal Chowk
 ab aap in dukaanon main purvottar se judaa kuch bhi kharid sakate hai
 Clothes, shoes, spices, parlors are all here
 unheen kapadon kii dukaane hai jinke pahanane se sthaneey logon ko apni samskruti khatre main nazar aati he
 There are also North East travel shops
 aap yahaan vahaan ke khaane se lekar yahaan se vahaan jane ke saare intazaam kar sakate hai
 Many times we do not see these relationships which have a lot of potential
 dilli police ne africa ke nagarikon se bhi baat kii ki sthaneey nagarikon kii samskruti kaa sammaan karen
 Doesn't music play till late night in our religious and wedding functions? tab ham apane kisi deshi videshi padosi kaa khyaal rakhte hai
 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Home Minister Rajnath Singh have taken these incidents with African citizens very seriously
 videsh rajya mantri ve ke singh ne twit kar kaha he ki, 'dilli police ke saath charchaa kii he
 We found the media calling a small quarrel an attack on Africans
 media aisa kyon kar rahaa he
 As a responsible citizen, we should ask questions to the media
 ' Broadcasters Association president NK Singh has strongly objected to VK Singh
 unka kahana he ki aisi choti ghatnaayen bhi badi ho jaati hai
 It is better that we take every incident seriously
 ve ke singh bhul gaye ki jab congou ke noujvaan kii maut hui thi tab us ghatana se naaraaz africa rajdooton ne bharat africa maitri kaarykram main jane se manaa kar diya tha
 Later everything became normal and this program took place
 isaki pratikriya congou main bhi hui
 On 26 May, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Vikas Swaroop said that some Indian shops in Congo have been attacked and some Indians have also been injured by gunfire
 ho saktaa he ki ye ghatana dilli main congou ke chaatr kii hatya kii pratikriya main hui ho
 The Indians were asked to close shops there
 ab maamla shant he
 The comments behatar he ki ham in ghatnaon ko maamuli na maane
 It is also true that there is a slight rumor, but it has to be understood that the words of violence from caste to caste are not wrong
 bharat ke raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne bhi in ghatnaon par bayaan jari kiya he
 Pranab Mukherjee said, 'we have close relations with African countries
 mahatma gandhi ne satyagrah kaa prayog pehle africa kii zamin par hi kiya jisane hamaare desh ko badla
 So how can we cope with this? ham aisa soch bhi kaise sakate hai
 Should African people not feel safe in India
 mujhe khushi he ki bharat sarkaar ne turant kadam uthaae
 i welcome the initiative of the Ministry of External Affairs in association with the Ministry of Home Affairs
 ' Oliver's friend said that he had been given racist abuses
 is ghatana ke prakaash main aate hi videsh mantri sushma swaraj ne apane str par turant sakriyata dikhaai
 Talked to the Home Minister, Deputy Governor of Delhi
 police ne mobin azaad naam ke yuvak ko giraftaar bhi kiya he
 Mobin Azad's two companions Mukesh and Prakash are absconding
 iske baad dakshin dilli ke raajpur khurd or maidan gadhi se bhi kuch ghatnaon kii khabar mili he
 Police says this is not racial violence
 bharat sarkaar ne in sabhi ghatnaon ko kaaphi gambhirtha se liya he
 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj also sent Minister of State for External Affairs VK Singh and Secretary Amar Sinha on Sunday
 police adhikariyon ne gaanv waalon ke saath baithak kii or donon pakshon kii baat ko suna or samajha
 It was also seen that African citizens were also at fault in some cases
 maamuli kahasuni se baat jhagade tak par pahunch gai
 The complaint by the villagers showed that they had a lot of objection to the lifestyle of African citizens
 der raat tak sangeet sunanaa
 Partying and waking up
 samskruti or vyavhaar ko lekar shikaayat sirf africa nagarikon se nahin rahi he, dakshin dilli ke gaanvon ke sthaneey logon kii purvottar ke kiraayedaaron se bhi yahi shikaayatein hai
 Around 4000 Northeast tenants live in Munirka in South Delhi
 aksar inke saath takaraav kii ghatana ho jaati he
 The villagers feel that whenever this happens the police or media does not listen to them, so people have installed about 200 CCTV cameras in Munirka with their money
 hamane resident welfare association ke adhyaksh bhagwaan dev se baat kii
 He said that these people live eight to ten people in a room, so we get more rent
 bahut se log kaaphi achche hai
 But when we are up late in the night, playing loud music and many times getting drunk, then we do not understand how to interfere in their mutual affairs
 bhagwaan dev ne do saal pehle muniraka main hui ek panchayat main saaf saaf kaha tha ki ham logon ko kisi ko bhi chinki, nepali yaa madrasi nahin kahana chahie
 They are all citizens of India
 hamaare kiraayedaar hai jinase hamaara kharchaa chalata he lekin kuch asamaajik tatv hai un par nazar rakhni hogi
 This initiative of Lord Dev is quite right that no one in Munirka would call them Chinki Nepali or the tenants of the south as Madrasi
 shekhar tokes ek sthaneey naagarik hai
 He says that the dialogue is growing
 ham log bhi jeenyu ke professor kii yahaan sabha karaate hai
 Thousands of leaflets have been distributed
 yah bhi ek behatar tarika he ki donon samskritiyon ke log ek duusare ko jaane
 The problem is when a culture claims a new culture
 acha ho ki donon baraabar jagah den
 The matter is related to Africa but referred to events in the Northeast because the two are related to each other
 agar ham sirf rang se in masalon ko jod denge to sahi nahin rahegaa
 The North East Cell Facebook page of the Delhi Police has thirty five thousand likes

 Now you can buy anything connected to the Northeast in these shops

 ) bank main jiro balance acount khulwaanaa kise acha nahin lagata? har koi chahta he ki acount aisa ho, jisamen rupaya jamaa rakhane kii koi shart na ho or bank chargeej bhi kam se kam hon
 But now when you think of opening a zero balance account, you will read the bank's terms and conditions carefully
 aisa nahin karnaa lakhanu ke dhirendra shrivastav ko manhagaa pads gaya
 The mother of Dhirendra Pratap Srivastava, who worked as a clerk in the Transport Department of Lucknow, died on 7 December
 unki maa sultanpur main unke gaanv main rahati thi
 Dheerendra reached Canara Bank to withdraw money for his mother's work, where his salary used to come in the account
 selary ek taarikh ko hi ai thi or ghar kharch ke liye unhone ab tak acount se sirf 10 hajaar hi nikaale the
 There were about one and a half lakh rupees in his bank account
 isliye wo nishcint the
 Despite demonetisation, Dhirendra was confident that due to the death of his mother, his bank would at least give him 14000 rupees
 dhirendra kaa tab dimag chakra gaya
 When the bank returned his check, he said that he cannot withdraw even one rupee from his salary account this month
 dhirendra main jab isaki vajah poochi to bank ne unhen bataaya ki unka acount jandhan acount he
 He was not willing to accept this, because 42,000 salary was received in this bank account every month and he had withdrawn several times more than Rs 50,000
 duusari baat ye ki unka ye acount aath saal purana tha jab jandhan acount hota hi nahin tha
 Surprised, Dhirendra told this to his colleagues in the office, then it came to know that he is not alone due to this problem
 unheen ke offis main kareeb do darjan log aise the, jinka acount kenra bankemen tha or sabko bank yahi taka sa jawaab de rahaa tha ki wo ab is maheene das hajaar se zyada nahin nikaal sakate
 All of them were traveling around the troubled Canara Bank
 dhirendra kii maa kaa nidhan hua tha, to unheen ke daftar main kaam karne vaali jyoti avasthi isliye pareshaan thi ki isi acount se unke home lone kii kisht nikalati thi
 The manager of Canara Bank said to Girish, who works in the transport department itself, that if you have to withdraw more than ten thousand rupees, then open another account in the same bank and transfer your money to that account
 jab ajtak ne is bare main bank ke branch manager es ke shrivastav se baat kii, to unhone ek aisa raaj kholaa ki parivahan vibhaag ke pareshaan karmchaaree bhi hairaan ho gaye
 The manager said that years ago, Canara Bank started a service similar to Jan Dhan Account, in which poor people could open accounts on zero balance, but there were some conditions for depositing and withdrawing money in this account
 is acount kaa naam 'can saral ' CAN SARAL ' tha
 Till now the bank never implemented these conditions and people were pouring and withdrawing as much money as they wanted, but after demonetisation, suddenly the bank started strictly enforcing these terms and conditions and imposing restrictions like Jan Dhan on this account
 Granted
 log pareshaan hai par bank kaa kahana he ki ab ek hi tarika he ki ye log doosraa acount khol kar apana rupaya usamen transfar kar len, yani jiro balens acount kholana in logon ko mahangaa pada

 nitish kumaar or lalu yadav kii sabhaayen desi andaaz main hoti thim
 The stage was simple and close to the public
 vidhansabha ke kisi khaas kshetra main hone ke kaaran aasapaas ke logon se bhi maidan bhar jaataa tha
 a large number of buses were seen at very few places
 magar pradhanmantri modi kii har sabha main bas, bolero or scorpiyo kii taadaad dekhne laayak hoti thi
 Obviously, there will be people brought so that the message from the crowd goes that the people are with the BJP
 samastipur kii raily main itani bheed thi ki mujhe laga ki bijepi yaa endie ko 200 siten aaengi
 But BJP could not win any one of the ten seats in Samastipur district
 pradhanmantri kii kisi bhi sabha kii tasviir nikaal kar dekhiye wo camere ke chlose main nazadik to dikhte hai, magar unka manch itnaa bada banaaya jaataa tha or janata se itani dur hota tha ki unhen dekhne ke liye ai bheed ji bhar ke dekh bhi nahin paati thi
 The distance between the speaker and the listener started increasing
 daawey ke saath nahin kah saktaa ki yahi duuri loksabhaa ke samay hoti thi yaa nahin
 But then the atmosphere was different
 narendra modi ko sunne ke saath saath dekhne kaa junun bhi tha logon main
 Sarthak Bagchi is a special guest with us
 sarthak netherland ke lyden university se piechdi kar rahe hai
 Comparative studies on how people are affected for votes in Maharashtra and Bihar assembly elections
 sarthak ne samastipur main pandrah din bitaaye or nitish kumaar, amit shah or pradhanmantri kii raily ko dekha or uske baad vahiin ke kisi gaanv main jaakar uske asar kaa aankalan kiya tha
 Can elections really be won by management? patna main bhi lalu prasad ke poster ek do hi nazar aae
 Posters of BJP and Nitish Kumar were dominated all over Patna
 kotwali thana or iskar chauraahey ke paas lalu ke do hi poster nazar aae
 Congress was nowhere to be seen
 aisa nahin ki laga nahin hoga, magar jab bhi poster dikhaa yaa to bijepi kaa dikhaa yaa nitish kumaar kaa
 Lalu Yadav had formed a team of tweeters but his voters were not smart phones
 dilli main baithe baithe ham log maan chuke hai ki matadaata vahi he, jiske paas smart phone he
 If the election can be won only by the management, then how did Lalu Yadav get the most seats
 bijepi or uske sahyogiyon ke do darjan helicopter ude
 BJP could win only 53 seats
 lalu yadav ek hi helicopter se 101 par ladakar 80 siten le aae
 Nitish Kumar's party JDU has got 71 seats
 ye sahi he ki prashanth kishor kii team ne lalu yadav or nitish kumaar ke liye saajha prabandh kaa intjaam kiya, lekin prabandhan ke maamle main phir bhi bijepi kii team baari thi
 The comments soshal media soshal media kiya ja rahaa he
 There is not a single leader of the grand alliance that is followed by two lakh people on Twitter
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ko twitor par 1 karod 59 lakh log follow karte hai
 The number of followers of Lalu Yadav is 1 lakh 61 thousand
 nitish kumaar ke foloar kii sankhya maatr 1 lakh 45 hazaar he
 In terms of numbers, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his colleague Lalu Yadav cannot compete with the Prime Minister
 magar in donon netaaon ne apni baton se khub jawaab diya, balki pehle twit kar bijepi ke netaaon ko jawaab dene ke liye majaboor bhi kiya
 i saw it during the Gujarat assembly elections
 congress ke netaa jis vakt kisi raily main aarope lagaate the, narendra modi usee din agali raily main jawaab de dete the
 But this time, Nitish Kumar adopted the same strategy
 pradhanmantri kii taraf se aarope aayaa nahin ki nitish kumaar ke press conferes kaa esemes aa jaataa tha
 Lalu Yadav's tweet used to come
 real time main donon netaa pradhanmantri se lard rahe the
 Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav's tweets also started flashing on the channels
 bihar chunaav ne kya chunaav prabandhan, shahi kharch kaa myth tod diya yaa phir se koi nayaa myth bana diya
 We are today with the journalists who were covering the Bihar elections
 unhone in sab tarkeebon ke bich matadaataaon ko kis tarah badalte dekha
 Did he see any new Bihar, which is being cheered after elections
 loksabhaa chunaavon main pradhanmantri modi kii raily kamyaabi kaa pratik ban gai
 Jimmy Jib Camera, modi-modi slogans, and spread of public opinion
 bihar main har raily main pradhanmantri ne kaha ki loksabhaa se bhi zyada bheed is baar dekh rahaa hum
 As far as i can see people are visible
 duusari taraf nitish kumaar or lalu yadav chunaav bhar safai dete rahe ki wo raily nahin kar rahe hai, sabha kar rahe hai
 The meetings of Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav were held in a native style
 manch saadhaaran hota tha or janata ke kareeb
 Due to being in a particular constituency of the assembly, the field was also filled with the people nearby
 bahut kam jagahon par badi sankhya main basen dikhin
 But in every meeting of Prime Minister Modi, the number of buses, Boleros and Scorpio was worth seeing
 zaahir he laae gaye log bhi honge taaki bheed se ye sandesh jaae ki janata bijepi ke saath he
 The rally in Samastipur was so crowded that i thought BJP or NDA would get 200 seats
 magar samastipur zile kii das main se ek bhi seat bijepi nahin jeet saki
 Take a picture of any gathering of the Prime Minister and see that they are close in camera close, but their stage was made so big and so far away from the public that the crowd that came to see them could not even see it with all their heart
 
 vaktaa or shrota main duuri bahut zyaada hone lagi
 Can't say with the claim whether this distance was in Lok Sabha or not
 lekin tab maahaul kuch alag hota tha
 Along with listening to Narendra Modi, there was also a passion to see
 hamaare saath ek khaas mehmaan hai sarthak bagchi
 Sarthak is pursuing his phd from Lyden University in the Netherlands
 maharashtra or bihar vidhansabha chunaavon main vot ke liye logon ko kaise prabhavit kiya jaataa he, is par tulanaatmak adhyayan kar rahe hai
 Sarthak spent fifteen days in Samastipur and saw the rally of Nitish Kumar, Amit Shah and the Prime Minister and then went to a village nearby to assess its impact
 kya vaaki chunaav prabandhan se hi jeeta ja saktaa he
 Posters of Lalu Prasad were also seen in Patna
 puure patna main bijepi or nitish kumaar ke poster chaaye rahe
 Two posters of Lalu were seen near the Kotwali police station and the Income Tax intersection
 congress kaa to kahin nazar bhi nahin aayaa
 Not that it will not be felt, but whenever the poster showed either bjp's or Nitish Kumar's
 lalu yadav ne zarur twit karne waalon kii team bana lee thi magar unke voter smart phone vaale nahin the
 We sitting in Delhi have agreed that the voter is the one who has the smart phone
 agar chunaav prabandhan se hi jeeta ja saktaa he to lalu yadav ko kaise sabase adhik siten aa gayi
 Two dozen helicopters of BJP and its allies landed
 bijepi 53 siten hi jeet saki
 Lalu Yadav fought on the same helicopter on 101 and brought 80 seats
 nitish kumaar kii party jediu ko 71 siten mili hai
 It is true that Prashant Kishore's team made arrangements for Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar, but in terms of management, the BJP team was still heavy
 tippaniyan Social Media Social media is being done
 mahagathbandhan kaa ek bhi netaa aisa nahin he jise twitor par do lakh log follow karte hon
 1 crore 59 lakh people follow Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Twitter
 lalu yadav ke foloar kii sankhya 1 lakh 61 hazaar he
 The number of followers of Nitish Kumar is 1 lakh 45 thousand
 sankhya ke maamle main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or unke sahyogi lalu yadav milakar bhi pradhanmantri se muqabla nahin kar sakate
 But both these leaders responded very well with their words, but also forced the BJP leaders to reply by tweeting first
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaavon ke samay maine dekha tha
 When Congress leaders made allegations in a rally, Narendra Modi would answer at the next rally the same day
 lekin is baar yahi ranneeti nitish kumaar ne apanaai
 There was no allegation from the Prime Minister that SMS of Nitish Kumar's press conference used to come
 lalu yadav kaa twit aa jaataa tha
 In real time, the two leaders were fighting the Prime Minister
 channelon par nitish kumaar or lalu yadav kaa twit bhi flash hone laga
 Did the Bihar election break the myth of election management, royal spending or create a new myth again
 ham aaj un patrakaron ke saath hai jo bihar chunaavon ko cover kar rahe the
 How did he see the voters changing between all these tricks
 kya unhen koi nayaa bihar nazar aa rahaa tha, jisaki jayakaar chunaavon ke baad ho rahi he
 But in every meeting of Prime Minister Modi, the number of buses, Boleros and Scorpio was worth seeing
 zaahir he laae gaye log bhi honge taaki bheed se ye sandesh jaae ki janata bijepi ke saath he

 landan olympic ke liye kwalifai karne vaale sabase yuva pahalwaan bharat ke amit kumaar purushon kii 55 kilogram freestil spardhaa ke quarter final mukaable main haar gaye hai
 Amit was beaten 3–1 by Georgia's Bladimir Kinchalega
 18 saal ke amit kii haar ke saath bharat ne is varg main swarna or rajat paane kii ummid kho di he, lekin uske paas abhi bhi kaansya paane kaa mauka he
 If Kinchalega is successful in reaching the final, Amit will get a chance to play in the Repage through which he can maintain his hopes for the bronze medal
 amit ne pre-quarter final main iran ke pahalwaan hasan sabajaali rahimi ko 3-1 se haraaya tha
 Amit, who got a bye in the first round, performed strongly against the much experienced Rahimi
 pehla round 0-1 se haarane ke baad amit ne duusare round kii samapti tak irani pahalwaan ko ank hasil nahin karne diya
 After this, Amit won the toss and slammed Rahimi for one point
 tisare round main rahimi ne ek ank hasil karke amit ko dabaav main laa diya tha lekin yah round samaapt hone ke ek minute pehle amit ne ek ank hasil kiya or phir ant tak rahimi ko chhakaate hue do ank or hasil kiye
 Thus he won the quarterfinals by a margin of 3–1, where he faced Kinchalega
 kinchaalega ne priquarter final main bulgaria ke manirove vaalikol ko 3-1 se haraaya tha
 Kinchalega will face Shinichi Yumoto of Japan in the semi-finals
 yomoto ne quarter final main armenia ke mihraan jaburhan ko 3-1 se haraaya
 Kinchalega's win in this round will open the way for Amit
