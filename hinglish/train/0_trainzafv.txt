 Another installment of inflation is knocking
 rupee kii lagaataar girti keemat or majboot ho rahe dollar ke kaaran ek baar phir petrol or dijal aapaki jeb kaatane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 It is not easy to stop this mishap on the pocket of customers
 yahi vajah he ki mana ja rahaa he petrol ke daam 1 se 2 rupee prati litre ke bich badaye ja sakate hai to dijal ke daamon main bhi 50 paise kii badhotaree kii ja sakati he
 According to sources, due to this depreciation of the rupee, oil companies are demanding that they should be allowed to increase the price of diesel from Rs 2 to 3 instead of 50 paise at a time, but fearing the rise in inflation, the government is demanding this It will not be easy to believe

 Every player's dream is to win a gold medal in the Olympics
 aam dharna yah he ki ek swarna padak purna rup se sone kaa bana hota he lekin aisa nahin he
 Contrary to popular belief, an Olympic gold medal consists of only nominal gold
 ab landan olympic ko hi lijie
 This time the gold medal weighing 400 grams is being given to the players in the Olympics but only 1 in it
 34 fisadi khara sona he jabaki 92
 5 percent silver and 6
 61 fisadi tambe kaa mishran he
 Thus, in today's date, a gold medal costs around Rs 38,900
 olympic itihaas main yah ab tak kaa sabase mahangaa padak he
 If this medal were made of 100% pure gold, then it would have cost Rs 12,22,540 today
 landan olympic main khilaadiyon ko lagbhag 300 swarna padak die jaaenge
 In this case, if the value of 300 gold medals is estimated, then it would be close to 66 million dollars today
 olympic ke itihaas main ab tak ke sabase bade aakaar kaa padak landan olympic main khilaadiyon ko diya ja rahaa he
 The medal weighs 400 grams, which is seven millimeters thick
 is padak kii chaudaai lagbhag 85 millimetre he
 Earlier, sizable medals were awarded at the 1992 Olympics held in Barcelona, spain
 us samay padakon kaa vajan 231 gram tha
 It weighed 200 grams at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which was six millimeters thick and 70 millimeters wide
 aisa nahin he ki olympic main kabhi sau fisadi khara sone kaa padak nahin diya gaya
 In the year 1912, a gold medal weighing 24 grams was given in Stockholm Olympics, which is also known as Sweden Olympics
 varsh 1896 pehle aadhunik olympic main pehle sthaan par rahane vaale khilaadi ko chaandi kaa jabaki up vijeta ko tambe se bana padak diya jaataa tha
 The winner was then awarded trophies and cups in 1900
 varsh 1904 main swarna, rajat or kaansya padak se khilaadiyon ko navaaje jane kaa chalan shuru hua
 The host country has the right to design the medal
 landan olympic ke padakon ko david watkins ne taiyaar kiya he
 These medals have a picture of goddess-nike symbolizing victory in Greece
 jharkhand ke gumla jile main bhagwaan parashuram kaa tap sthal he
 This place is about 150 km from Ranchi
 puranic kathaon ke anusaar, bhagwaan parashuram ne yahaan shiv kii ghor upasna kii thi
 It was here that he buried his parshu ie furs
 is farse kii upree akruti kuch trishul se milti-julati he
 This is the reason that devotees come here to worship this Farsa, while this temple of Shiva Shankar is known as Tanginath Dham
 kaha jaataa he ki tanginath dham main saakshaat bhagwaan shiv nivas karte hai
 The extraordinary coincidence that is happening on Maha Shivaratri, may change your fate
 The temple is located in Jangal, this Biwan and wooded area of jharkhand, on the occasion of Shivratri, devotees come to visit Tanginath
 yahaan sthit ek mandir main bholenath shaashvat rup main hai
 The local tribals are the priests here and they say that this temple is very ancient
 in mantron se karen bhagwaan shiv ko prasanmaanyata he maharishi parashuram ne yaheen apane parashu yani farse ko gaad diya tha
 Local people also worship it as Trishul
 aashcharya kii baat ye he ki isamen kabhi jang nahin lagata
 Sun, shade, rain under the open sky - this Trishul does not have any effect
 adivasee bahul ye ilaaka puri tarah ugravad se prabhavit he
 In such a situation, the crowd of Shiva devotees here mostly on the day of Sawan and Mahashivratri
 shiv naam se aise milegaa papa se chhutkaarapuranic mahatvatreta yug main jab bhagwaan shriram ne janakapur main yojit sita mata ke swayamvar main shiv ji kaa dhanush todaa to vahaan pahunche bhagwaan parashuram kaaphi krodhit ho gaye
 During this he had a long debate with Lakshmana and in the meantime when Parashurama came to know that Lord Shri Ram himself is Narayana, then he became very self-conscious
 bhagwaan shiv kaa rudra avatar hai hanumansharm ke maare ve vahaan se nikal gaye or pashchaatap karne ke liye ghaney jangalon ke bich ek parvat shrinkhalaa main aa gaye
 Here he started worshiping after establishing Lord Shiva
 gal main unhone apana parashu arthath farse ko gaad diya
 Also associated with Shani Dev, the ancient temple of Gathatanginath Dham has collapsed due to lack of maintenance and the entire area has turned into ruins but ancient Shivling is still scattered in this hill
 yahaan maujuud kalakritiyaan- nakkashiyaan or yahaan kii banaavat devkaal kii kahani bayaan karti hai
 There will be many such sources, which will lead to the name of Mahadev
 vaise ek kahani or bhi he
 It is said that Shiva belonged to the ancient castes of this region
 shanidev ke kisi aparaadh ke liye shiv ne trishul phenk kar waar kiya to vah is pahari kii chotii par aa dhansa
 Know the mystery of Mahadev's third eye, but his front part remained above the ground
 jabaki trishul jameen ke neeche kitna gada he, yah koi nahin jaanata

 Dharma will demand to bring order on the government for the construction of sadashu-santram temple in the country
 akhil bhartiya sant samiti ke mahaamantri swami jitendranand saraswati ne kaha ki sant samaaj desh ke alag-alag muddon par charchaa karenge
 He said that anti-national forces are involved in urban naxalites
 supreme court ke mananeey jaj unmaad failaa rahe hai, ayodhya ke maamle main jab vah kehete hai ki unke paas samay nahin he
 He said that through private member bill it will also be clear who is in favor of Ram temple and who is in opposition

 ayodhya maamle par jamiyat-ulema-e-hind aaj punarvichaar yachika daakhil karegi
 According to the information being received, Ashrad Madani's press conference will be held at 5 pm
 isse pehle beete 15 november ko ayodhya maamle ko lekar supreme court ke faisle par samiksha ke liye yojit jamiyat ulema hind rashtriya kaarysmiti baithak ke nishkarsh main adhyaksh moulana arshad madani ne kaha tha ki court kaa faisla samaj se pare he
 In the eyes of law and justice, there was and is a Babri Masjid and till the doom, the mosque will remain, irrespective of its name or appearance
 madani nekaha tha ki court ke faisle se ek baat spasht he ki masjid kaa nirmaan kisi mandir ko todakar nahin kiya gaya or naa hi kisi mandir kii jagah par hua
 This stain on the issue of Muslims was washed away due to this court, in which there were allegations of breaking the temple or building a mosque on the site of the temple
 aapako bataa den ki is faisle kii samiksha ke liye ek panel banaaya he jo vakeelon or shikshavidon se tathyon or pramaanon ke aadhaar par nishkarsh nikaalega kii punarvichaar yachika daakhil karnaa he yaa nahin
 Madani said about the court's decision that in a way the court believed that it was wrong to keep the idol inside the mosque and then break it, yet the court gave the land to the people who kept the idol in the mosque and then broke the mosque
 court dwaara 5 acre jameen mudde par madani ne kaha ki musalmaan kabhi bhi jameen kaa mohataaj nahin rahaa or ye jameen court ne sunni vakf board ko di he or meri salaah ye he ki board ko jameen nahin sweekaar kerani chahie
 After this meeting, Madani said that if the mosque had not been demolished, would the court have said that the temple should be built by breaking the mosque? We are satisfied that the court admitted that the mosque was not built by demolishing the temple, but regrettably, contrary to the evidence and facts, the court gave the entire land to Ram Lala

 kareeb teen ghante tak sapa rajya mukhyalay se lekar sapa mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav ke awaas ke saamne sadak par paraspar virdohi samarthakon kaa kabja rahaa
 During this time, the police had to work hard to handle them
 sapa mukhyalay ke saamne se hataae jane ke baad badi sankhya main mukhyamantri akhilesh ke samarthak unke sarkari awaas par pahunch gaye
 The Chief Minister called him inside and said that it is Netaji's decision to make Shivpal the State President
 iske khilaaf yah andolan khatm hona chahie
 Not being the state president of the party will not make much difference
 unhone kaha ki vah unki bhaawanaaon kaa sammaan karte hai, lekin party main ekta banaae rakhana pehali praathamikta honi chahie
 It is expected that the youth will understand these things and with the party's visit, he will once again form a socialist government in the state

 mukhyamantri ne unhen andar bulaakar kaha ki shivpal ko pradesh adhyaksh bananaa netaji kaa faisla he
 This movement against it must end
 party kaa pradesh adhyaksh na hone se koi bahut fark nahin padegaa
 He said that he respects his feelings, but maintaining unity in the party should be the first priority
 ummid he ki noujvaan in baton ko samajhenge or vah party kii yatra ke saath pradesh main ek baar phir samaajawaadee sarkaar banayega
 After SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav came forward on Friday claiming that there was no difference in the party and the Chief Minister returned the department that was snatched from Shivpal last night, it seemed that the differences emerged in the party are now over, but both It has become clear from the supporters of the factions that they have taken to the streets today that the round of the takhi has taken a new turn

 pet main bhayanak dard se tadap rahe ek marij kii yahaan ek aspataal main robot ke jariye safal surgery kii gai
 The disease of this patient was of rare type, but after this surgery the patient got relief from pain
 yah durlabh beemaari 100,000 logon main se kisi ek main pai jaati he
 This is called 'celiac artery compression syndrome'
 isaki pahchaan siliek dhamni ke pet main dabane se paidaa hone vaale dard se hoti he
 Presently, surgery is the only option
 isamen us ligament ko nikaal diya jaataa he, jo dawaab kaa kaaran hota he
 However, conventional surgery is not easy to access the celiac artery, as it is located below the diaphragm
 sterlig aspataal ke gastro intestinal shalya chikitsak apurv vyas ne ek bayaan main shuukravaar ko kaha, "chaar haath vaale shalya chikitsa robot ke istemaal se main siliek dhamni Was able to reach the core of where human fingers cannot reach
 " Vyas said, "I am happy to see the health benefits of the patient
 vah shalya chikitsa ke baad tisare din ghar chalaa gaya
 " siliek dhamni main dabaav ko pachan tantra ke dil ke daure jaise halaat se tulana kii jaati he
 The comments isamen marij jaise hi khaanaa shuru karata he, use bahut tej dard hota he
 He is not able to eat according to the needs of the body
 is maamle ko is maheene ke shuru main chennai main america ke gaiyr laabhakaari wattikuti foundation ke dwivarshik robotic shalya chikitsa parishad kii baithak main prastut kiya gaya tha
 Sturig Hospital's gastro-intestinal surgeon Apoorva Vyas said in a statement on Friday, "the use of a four-handed surgical robot involves the celiac artery
 ke mul tak pahunchane main sakasham rahaa, jahaan maanav kii ungliyaan nahin pahunch saktin
 " vyas ne kaha, "main marij ke swasthya laabh ko dekhakar khush hum
 He went home on the third day after surgery
 " Pressure in the celiac artery is compared to conditions such as a heart attack in the digestive system
 tippaniyan In this, as soon as the patient starts eating, he gets very strong pain
 vah sharir kii jarurat ke mutabik nahin kha paata he
 The case was presented at a biennial robotic surgery council meeting of the non-profit Wattikuti Foundation of America in Chennai earlier this month

 After the sp's landslide victory in Uttar Pradesh last year, there were speculations that 'netaji', the Samajwadi Party president, will create a stir in the politics of Yadavkendra
 unhone apane kaaryakartaaon ko madhyavadhi chunaav ke liye taiyaar rahane ko kah diya tha
 His enthusiasm seemed to suggest that the Third Front could once again emerge
 lekin centre main trinmul congress ke gathbandhan sarkaar se baahar hone ke baad bhi kuch nahin hua
 Some believe that the Congress has retained a disproportionate assets case against the Mulayam Singh family to retain sp's support, although Netaji considers it an endorsement on principled issues
 is baar unhone apane kaaryakartaaon ko sitambar main chunaav ke liye taiyaar rahane ko kaha he
 Excerpts from his conversation with India Today Group's Aaj Tak Ashok Singhal on the political situation of the country: Why do you repeatedly say that elections will not be held on time, elections will be held early, the government will not complete its term
 kabhi sitambar kii baat karte hai, kabhi madhyavadhi chunaav kii, kya vajah he?nahin, maine ek hi baar kaha he
 And it has been said on this basis that the government has failed on every front
 jo vaade kiye the janata ke saamne, garibi ko dur karenge, berogari ko dur karenge, or mahangaai hataa denge
 So inflation has increased, unemployment has increased, and they could not provide employment
 ek to kisaanon kii paidaavaar kam hui, us par se unhen uskaa uchit mulya nahin mil paaya
 The laborers who work in the fields, work in the factories, could not even complete what they said in the manifesto
 to kul milakar chaahe ki saan hon, majdoor hon, vyapaaree hon, garib hon, vakil hon, chaahe rajya karmchaaree hon yaa dukandaar hon jinke liye vaade kiye ve puure nahin kar paae, na kar paaenge
 The economic situation is getting worse
 unhone kaha tha ki desh kii aarthik sthiti bahut jaldi thik kar denge, doosraa kaha tha ki mahangaai ko gata denge
 Will finish to meraa kahana yah tha ki mahangaai ko agar khatm nahin kar sakate, to roak to sakate the, thahar to sakati thi mahangaai
 When the government got them, the inflation that was at the same time could not remain even then
 to mahangaai badi, garibi badi, berozegaar bade, kisaanon kii paidaavaar kam hui
 The farmer was devastated
 or sabase badi mahangaai kii maar garib par padi
 The yield of farmers was taken at a cheap price and when it had to be bought, it was sold expensive
 ab in saare morchon par asafal hai
 Now they will try to keep the budget good, they want to contest from the election budget
 yah unka aakhri bajet he
 Because they will not be able to present the next
 aglaa bajet to vahi pesh karenge, jo nae aaenge
 Therefore, some good work is being done in this budget
 or jo achche karenge, chunaav ladgaye ke liye usee ko lekar ye ja rahe hai janata ke bich
 This is our information and i understand and they have no other option
 baar-baar kehete hai ki madhyavadhi chunaav ho saktaa he, lekin sarkaar ko samarthan jari rakhe hue hai, aisi kya majaburi he?hamaari majaburi koi nahin he
 Our theoretical question is
 ham sampradayik shaktiyon ke khilaaf lade hai or samaajawaadee party sampradayik shaktiyon ke khilaaf ladati rahegi
 So the question is that BJP is on one side and Congress and third front is not united on one side, otherwise the third front would have got majority
 hamaara siddhant he ki communal force ke khilaaf ladi he samaajawaadee party
 And if there is second support in India, then the left party has got it and in the meantime the Congress has neither fought the BJP nor has anyone fought with communalism
 samaajawaadee party ladi he, or samay-samay par samaajawaadee party kaa sahyog vampanthi dalon ne diya he
 If you are talking about elections, your party is ready for elections, then BJP alleges that Mulayam Singh Ji withdraws support only then elections will be held
 samarthan waapas nahin le rahe hai kyonki chunaav vaise hi sir par he
 If your party is ready then why not withdraw support? If such an issue will come up, as will any issue of anti-people
 loksabhaa ke andar tab to samaajawaadee party samarthan dene, na dene par vichaar kar sakati he
 No such anti-people work has come so far
 ek hi kaam he jo puure desh ke, janata ke saamne he
 They are two works
 ek mahangaai, doosraa berogari
 Why don't you demand withdrawal of support on issues? These two are work related to the common man
 aap kehete hai ki yah sarkaar aam aadmi ke khilaaf kaam kar rahi he
 So these are very big issues in front of you
 agar ham bich main samarthan waapas karen, to hamaare waapas karne se to congress sarkaar giregi nahin
 We cannot say anything hidden
 kyonki agar samaajawaadee party samarthan waapas bhi kar le tab bhi congress kaa bahumat he
 On the basis of this principle, you would have seen such issues on which we did not support the Congress government, opposed FDI, opposed to tightness as much as anyone, or as much as the Samajwadi Party did
 or iske pehle or kai mudde aae
 Those issues were also opposed by the Samajwadi Party
 congress ko vot nahin diya
 But Mulayam Singh ji, the opposition also raises the question that AAP appears with the government on many issues inside the House, and in opposition on many issues
 to sthiti bahut saaf nahin dikhaai detii
 There is confusion
 hamaari niti saaf he
 The Samajwadi Party is never a dilemma party
 nitiyaan jo hamaari hai usee ke aadhaar par chaahe loksabhaa ho, yaa sansad ke andar ho yaa baahar ho, samaajawaadee party unheen nitiyon par chalati he
 It is true that the Samajwadi Party takes the stand
 chaahe raashtrapati chunaav kaa mudda ho, yaa epadi kaa mudda ho yaa mahangaai kaa
 But the question gets stuck here
 chunaav ke liye aap logon ne siton kaa aavanton kar diya tha kuch samay pehle
 When you are ready for the Lok Sabha seats, the government may fall or not, you can move forward on the issue of public
 wo to ham ja rahe hai
 Our party is preparing for elections
 or uttar pradesh main jitne ummidavaaron ko ladaana tha, utana ghoshit kar diya
 Another big question arises
 aap bhi phase karte hai un muddon ko lekar ki sarkaar sibiai kaa dar dikhaakar aap logon se samarthan le rahi he
 ongoing support
 aisa nahin he
 It is true that the government of Delhi has only two functions, one is the CBI and the other is the Congress party has always tried to suppress the opposition on economic matters
 lekin samaajawaadee party apni nitiyon par hameshaa rahegi
 Whether it is the matter of CBI, it is a matter of causing financial loss in some way
 ye to he
 They have an income tax and a CBI in their hands
 to inakam tex or sibiai kaa puraa-puraa upyog yah sarkaar karti he
 always
 to aapke upar bhi kabhi dabaav daalane kii koshish kii hogi?hamaare peeche to sibiai laga hi di he
 But you must have seen in the House that we did not compromise our policies
 mulaayam singh ji, ek baat or he: (congress ne) rahul gandhi ko bhi upaadhyaksh bana diya
 What do you think? How many big leaders are they, that will benefit the party? Will it be rejuvenating? That Congress, we can say about our party
 congress kaa kya he
 How much hope, how much hope are going on, so this is not a new thing
 ye to pehle se tay tha
 Soniaji was the leader, before her was Rajiv, before her was Indira
 aapako pataa hi he
 Why do you name everyone? The leader is the same and there is no courage
 sahi baat bhi kehane kii himmat vahaan par nahin he
 When there is a meeting inside the party, people hear, no one has the courage to say such a thing
 desh main dharmik or shaikshanik sansthaaon ne dharm-karm or samajaseva ke naam par janata se khub chanda batora, lekin zyaadaatar unhen charity par kharch karne kii bajaay bainkon main jamaa karte rahe
 More than four lakh crore rupees have been deposited in banks by these institutions
 vitt mantralay ne aisi sansthaaon ke inakam tex ritern yani form 7 kii jaanch ke baad paaya he ki zyaadaatar paisa inakam tex main mili tex chhot kii suvidha kaa galat istemaal karke kiya gaya he
 Modi government is now going to take the initiative to stop the theft in the name of tax exemption
 chaar saal ke tex ritern kii jaanch main pataa chalaa he ki treston ne apane tex main hisaab kuch or dikhaaya he or tex kii dendaree kuch or nikali he
 'most of the cases are of private educational and religious institutions
 sarkaar tex chhot ke dushprayog ko rokane ke liye nae inakam tex main sakhti baratane par vichaar kar rahi he
 The top official of the Finance Ministry gave this information to India Today on the condition of anonymity
 15 fisadi inakam par milane vaali chhot kaa paisa charity se jude kaamon main kharch na karke kai saalo se bainkon main jamaa ho rahaa he
 If the trusts take money through secret donations and do not spend that money on their work, then the government can impose a tax of thirty per cent
 sarkaar ko is baat kii jaankaree he ki nijee laabh ke liye kuch trust nagdi ke badale daan main check lete hai
 The current tax rule for a trust is income tax free
 saamaajik kalyaan ke kaam main paisa lagane ko protsaahit karne ke liye sarkaar trust ke 15 fisadi hisse ko to bina kisi saboot ke hi maaf kar detii he, lekin baaki 85 fisadi rakam par tex chhot lene liye kharchon kaa hisaab dena padataa he
 85% of the money has to be spent within five years, but the Finance Ministry data shows that the trusts are misusing tax exemption

 It is no longer the day when the soul trembled upon hearing Everest's name
 ab log record banane ke liye kam, anand lene ke liye zyada everest kii chadhaai kar rahe hai
 The result of this is that now the waiting list is also being seen there
 ek jattha hate to doosraa pahunche
 Due to this, accidents are increasing, where heaps of garbage are also accumulating there
 isse bachane ke liye nepal sarkaar kai tarkiben soch rahi he
 The government is going to bring some such rules law so that the ascent of Everest does not become a mere tafri
 kaaphi mushkil ho jaaegi chadhainuyork times kii report ke mutabik, everest par chadhane waalon ko pehle yah sabit karnaa hoga ki ve kisi or chotii par chadhaai kar chuke hai
 Rule companies will now come under the purview of the law, who take their clients there
 tourism companiyon ko yah dikhaanaa hoga ki unhen is maamle main 3 saal kaa tarjuba he
 The company which has been taking Everest Climbers for the last three years will be given preference
 everest chadhaai par cost kating bhi haaavee he
 That is, everyone wants to win at least money
 iskaa asar un companiyon par padaa he jo everest kii chadhaai yojit karti hai
 They are under pressure to carry people for less and less money
 cost kating ke pher main logon kii jaan saansat main aa rahi he
 Many such stories were heard that the team which climbed Everest went missing
 baad main bachaav dal ne kaaphi parishram ke baad cliembers ko bachaaya
 Nepal government is preparing to increase the climbing fees to tighten it
 chadhaai karaane vaali companiyon ko 35 hajaar dollar tak kii raashi chukaani pad sakati he
 By adding additional fees, this expense can reach 50 thousand dollars
 permit paane main fasenge kai pennb aisa nahin hoga ki man kiya isliye everest par chadhaai karne chale gaye
 Before climbing Everest, there will be many tests, including health and climbing skills
 fitness test or chadhaai kii kushalta dekhne ke baad hi permit jari kiya jayega
 According to the current rule, a copy of passport, biodata and health certificate are sought from the climbers
 isamen pareshaani ye he ki nepali prashasan logon kii sehat ke bare main chaanbin nahin kar paata ki certificate main jo likhaa gaya, vah kitna sahi he
 Now Everest's permit will be given only to him who has previously reached a height of 21,300 feet
 chadhaai ke naam par sajeesh!everest par chadhaai nepal kii kamai kaa majboot jariya he
 Nepal government gets a lot of revenue from this
 1990 main everest chadhaai kaa vyapaarikaran hua
 That is, after 1990, the Nepal government started collecting money from those climbing Everest
 koi bhi nirdhaarit raashi chukaa kar everest ja saktaa he lekin isamen ek badi sajeesh saamne ai
 It turned out that some guides, helicopter companies and hospitals have gone through a huge mess to earn money so that insurance money can be grabbed

 dusu kaa dangal taiyaar hai campaning ke rang campus main har jagah najar aa rahe hai
 But in student elections, it is as important to take care of the guidelines as it is to conduct
 har chaatr chunaavon se pehle collejon main jaakar chaatro tak pahuchane kii harsambhav koshish main laga hua hai
 But Guidelines and ngt's first condition is paperless campaigning
 lekin campus main har jagah is guideline kaa dhadlle se ulanghan ho rahaa hai
 Pamphlets and posters sticking to the poles on the walls everywhere are proof of this
 lekin chaatr dalon kaa kahana hai ki unke paas koi doosraa vikalp nahin hai amrutha dhawan NSUI rashtriya adhyaksh kaa kahana hai ki agar prashasan paper les prachaar chaahati hai to unhen bhi hamen chaatro tak pahuchane ke duusare vikalp dene chahie jaise har college main aadha ghanta interection kaa time or wal of demokrasi jaisi sahuuliyat de taaki ham chaatro tak pahuch sake
 Apart from this, according to the guideline, campaigning by pasting posters on trains is also forbidden, but camping is also on by pasting the names of potential candidates on trains
 chaatr raajnneeti main dal zyada se zyadasoshal mediake jariye campaning kar sakate hai taaki chunaav prachaaron ko paperles banaaya ja sake lekin is baat par chaatr dalon kii daleel hai ki 50 college ke bacchon tak pahuchanaa aasaan nahin hai or isiilie wo log paper kaa istemaal karne par majaboor hai
 All parties have devised a strategy for paperless politics, but on the ground there is no visible impact
 jahaan abhi bhi paper kii barbaadi or kachra campus main saaf dikhaai de rahaa hai

 unhone kaha, "yadi unhone aisa faisla liya he to ham unke saath hai
 "another person claimed that it is easier to connect with Ajit Pawar than NCP Chiefs Sharad Pawar and Supriya Sule

 gangs of vasepur ke baad mujhe bahut ofer aae
 In all those films i would have a gun in my hand
 lekin ashvini ayyar ji ne mujhe panga lene vaala rasta dikhaaya
 Right after the gun i had a choke and duster in my hand
 film thi nil batte sannata
 Working on different characters as an artist is challenging as well as exciting
 ye mere liye kalakaar ke taur par nae raste kholane vaala tha
 It was messed up bandook vaale sultan kuraishi ke image se panga
 Together with Ashwini we next screwed up as the father of an open winged daughter
 bitti ke pita narottam mishra ke rup main
 This time was a mess against a conservative society
 hanste, hansaate betiyon ke paron ko kholana sikhaati thi ye film
 It was Bareilly's barfi
 ashvini ke saath kaam karnaa hameshaa se ek kalakaar ke taur par nai ummiido, nae daravaajon ko kholane jaisaa he
 You explore yourself better
 aap khud se or khud ke banaae simaaon se lete ho panga
 Working in each of his films is an invisible agreement i made for myself
 or meraa hameshaa se maananaa rahaa he ki jab aap ek parivaar kii tarah hote hai to har kaam santushti detaa he
 And when your family is with you, it becomes easier to mess with life
 is baar ham le rahe hai panga sidhaa panga se
 Our next film as 'panga'
 shubhakamanaayen puri 'panga' team ko

 On the first day of the Congress government's workday in Madhya Pradesh, a Twitter war between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress started
 darasal, madhya pradesh (madhya Pradesh) sachivalay main maheene kii pehali taarikh ko vande maataram (vande Mataram) gane kii 13 saal puraani parampara is baar tut gai or is tarah se nae saal ke pehle kaary diwas yani ek janvari ko mantralay main ‘vande maataram' nahin gaaya gaya
 After this, former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan became a complete attacker
 shivaraj singh chouhan ne sachivalay main maheene ke pehle kaarydiwas par vande maataram na gaae jane ko lekar satta main baithi congress par hamalaa bolaa or kaha ki congress ko agar raashtragit gane main shame aa rahi he to vah khud har maheene kii pehali taarikh ko vandemataram gaayenge
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan attacked the Kamal Nath government after Vande Mataram was not sung in the secretariat
 soobe ke purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan (shivraj Singh Chauhan) ne bhi apni pratikriya di or twit kar kaha ki 'congress yah bhul gai he ki sarkarein aati hai jaati hai lekin desh or deshbhakti se upar kuch nahin he
 i demand that the song of Vande Mataram should always be in the courtyard of Vallabh Bhavan before every cabinet meeting and on the first date of every month
 'congress shaayad yah bhul gai he ki sarkarein aati he, jaati he lekin desh or deshbhakti se upar kuch nahin he
 i demand that the anthem of Vande Mataram be in the courtyard of Vallabh Bhavan as always before every cabinet meeting and on the first date of every month
 unhone aage kaha ki 'vande maataram ke kaaran logon ke hriday main prajvalit deshbhakti kii bhaawanaaon main nayi urja kaa sanchaar hota tha
 It is very unfortunate that the Congress government broke this tradition today
 aaj pehali tarikh ko vande maataram nahin gaaya gaya!'ek anya twit main shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha ki 'agar kagress ko raashtra geet ke shabd nahin aate hai yaa phir raashtra geet ke gayan main shame aati he, to mujhe bataa den! har maheene kii pehali taarikh ko vallabh bhawan ke praangan main janata ke saath vand maataram main gaaungaa
 In the Shivraj government in Madhya Pradesh, Vande Mataram was sung by all ministers every week before the cabinet meeting and all the employees and officers were present in Vande Mataram anthem in the premises of Vallabh Bhavan (secretariat) on the first day of every month

 Many candidates used to be before 1974 The presidential election has been a direct contest between the ruling party or coalition candidates and the opposition contestants in the last two decades
 lekin, yah hameshaa se aisa nahin rahaa he
 The first presidential election was held in 1952
 tab se lekar ab tak is pad ke liye ye 15waan chunaav he
 In the elections of 1952, 1957, 1962, 1967 and 1969 for the presidency it was seen that some people filled nomination papers even though there was no hope of getting elected
 kuch vyaktiyon ne to raashtrapati pad ke liye nirvachan ko halke dhang se lete hue ise nyaayalay main bhi chunauti di
 Changes in the rules in 1974 To remove these loopholes, the laws related to the election of the President and Vice President were changed in 1974
 1974 main yah praavdhaan kiya gaya ki kisi ummidavaar ke namakan patr ke saath kam se kam 10 nirvaachakon samarthan prastaavak ke rup main or 10 nirvaachakon kaa samarthan dwitiyak ke rup main hona chahie
 Also, the surety amount was increased to Rs 2500 (more than that time) and it was also provided that if an election petition is filed, it should be filed only in the Supreme Court by the candidate himself who is contesting the election
 And was accompanied by at least 20 electors as petitioners
 niyamon main badlaav kaa asar, 4 se zyada nahin rahe ummidavaar1974 main niyamon main badlaav ke baad ummidavaaron kii sankhya 15 se sidhe 2 par aa gai
 In 1977, 37 candidates filed nominations, but after scrutiny the nominations of 36 candidates were rejected
 neelam sanjeev reddy conirvirodh nirvaachit ghoshitkiya gaya
 This was the first time an uncontested election was held for the highest post as the President of India
 1982 main phir se sirf do ummidavaaron ke bich raashtrapati chunaav hua
 Three candidates stood in 1987 and four in 1992
 1997, 2002 or 2007 main ek baar phir is pad ke liye do hi ummidavaar khadey hue
 In 1997, at the time of the 11th Presidential election of 1997, the President of India further amended the President and vice-president Act 1952 by issuing an ordinance on June 5, 1997
 ab prastaavkon or dwitiyakon kii sankhya jo namakan patr ke saath honi chahie, 10 se badhaakar 50 prastaavak or 10 dwitiyak ke sthaan par 50 dwitiyak kar di gayi
 The bail amount was increased from 2500 to 15000 rupees
 raashtrapati chunaav 1967 main 17 or 1969 main 15 ummidavaar maidan main the lekin kanoon main ukt badlaavon ke baad inaki sankhya main baari kami ai
 Since then there have been no more than four candidates in any election

 a campaign 'digvijay 4CM' has been launched on Twitter on Monday evening demanding senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh to be the face of Congress for the post of Chief Minister
 is abhiyaan par pratikriya vyakt karte hue digvijay ne mangalvaar ko twit kiya, 'jisane bhi yah abhiyaan shuru kiya he, vah meraa shubhachintak nahin he
 i have been the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh for a decade and there is no question of withdrawing from my earlier statement that i am not a candidate for the post of Chief Minister
 main aisa nahin hum, jo kahen kuch or karen kuch or
 'let us tell that Digvijay Singh has been the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh for ten years from 1993 to 2003
 vah kai dfa yah bayaan de chuke hai ki yadi congress pradesh main aglaa vidhansabha chunaav jitkar satta main aati he to vah mukhyamantri pad kii daud main nahin he
 It is noteworthy that assembly elections will be held in the state later this year
 karj main dubi public sector kii airline company air india ke karmchaariyon ko aane vaale dinon main selary sankat se jujhna pad saktaa he
 Actually, Air India does not have the money to pay salaries to employees after October
 yah jaankaree do bade sarkari adhikariyon ne di he
 Recently, the state-run telecom company BSNL also sought help from the government for giving salary to the employees
 iconomics times kii khabar ke mutabik ek adhikari ne bataaya ki sarkaar ne air india ko 7,000 karod kii rakam par soweran guarantee di thi or company ke paas ab 2,500 karod rupee bache hai
 Officials say that the money will be spent in paying a few months' salary in addition to paying the dues of oil companies, airport operators and other vendors
 anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa he ki oktober ke baad air india ko selary sankat se jujhna pad saktaa he
 According to the government official, Air India has been paying it late for the last few months
 ek anya adhikari ke mutabik company ne may kii selary bhi 10 din kii deree se di thi
 Let us know that Air India spends 300 crore rupees on salary every month
 air india ke vinievesh kii ho rahi koshishlambe samay se sarkaar air india ke vinievesh kii koshish kar rahi he lekin manamafik kharidaar nahin mil rahe hai
 Recently, Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Minister Arvind Ganpat Sawat has given information about the disinvestment of Air India
 darasal, vinievesh prakriya nivesh kaa ulataa hota he
 Where investment is to be invested in a business, an institution or a project, then disinvestment means withdrawing that amount
 bataa den ki air india ko is vitt varsh main 9,000 karod rupee ke karj kaa bhugtan karnaa he
 The company has sought the government's help on this, but it is unlikely to be accepted
 sarkaar is airline main apni 76 fisadi hissedari bechnaa chaahati he
 BSNL is also witnessing a salary crisis in the telecom company BSNL, apart from the beleaguered India
 beete farvari maheene main beasenel karmchaariyon ko selary milane main deree hui thi

 The final of the World Cup will be two and a half hours on Saturday afternoon and the result will be available till 10 pm
 par team india ke maidan main utarane se pehle heworldkapaphinal kaa nateeja aa gaya he
 Yes, the team has won the indiaworld Cup
 lekin yah kisi jyotish kii bhavishyavaanee nahin balki us satta bazaar kaa daawa he jisane chah hafte pehle hi ye bataa diya tha ki is baar worldcup kaa final bharat or srilanka ke bich hi hoga
 Then the first ball of the World Cup was also not thrown
 19 farvari ko worldcup kaa pehla match bharat or bangladesh ke bich khelaa jane vaala tha
 But two days before that, Hissatta Bazaar gave its verdict
 faisla, world champion kaa, faisla final main pahunchane vaali do tiimon kaa
 The decision of four teams to reach the semi-finals
 faisla worldcup main sabase zyada ran banane or sabase zyada wicket lene vaale khilaadiyon kaa
 And quoting the same speculative market, Aaj Tak had said on February 17 that the World Cup final will be played between India and Sri Lanka at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on 2 April
 satta bazaar ke daweor bhav ke hisaab se bharat or srilanka sachmuch final main ek duusare se bhidane ja rahi hai
 So everyone's eyes are now on the last bet of this speculative market
 final main baazi koun jitegaa? kya sachmuch final ke bare main bhi satta bazaar kaa daav isi tarah sach sabit hoga?har hindustani ke liye khushkhabari he
 Because the speculative market still holds on to its claim of 17 February
 daawa ye ki 2 april ko ye chamchamati trophy kisi or ke haath main nahin balki team india ke captainmahendra singh dhonike haathon main hogi
 The Satta Bazaar has also opened its last price for the World Cup
 57 paise ke saath ye bhav bhi bharat ke hi haq main he
 Satta Bazaar has opened the price for the final 57 paise India
 yani jinhen lagata he ki final lanka jitegaa wo 57 paise ke upar lanka par daanv khel sakate hai
 So those who do not agree with the speculative market and who have the correct answer to the final, just understand that the World Cup 2011 will make them rich
 ye dasvaan world cap he or aisa pehali baar hua he jab satta bazaar ne team india par itnaa bharosa jataayaa he
 Now call it the effervescence of Dhoni or the performance of Team India in recent times
 isi satta bazaar nebharat-paak muqablese pehle yani 29 march ko hi ye bataa diya tha ki bharat final main pahuunchega
 Overall, excluding two results, every bet of the speculative market is sitting right this time
 tab world cap kaa sabase bada match yanibharat-pakistan ke bich mohali main semifinalshuru nahin hua tha
 The match was to take place on 30 March
 jabaki satta bazaar ne 29 march ko hi elaan kar diya tha ki team india final main pahunch rahi he or 29 march ko yah jaankaree hamane aap tak bhi pahunchaa di thi
 By the way, in this world cup of betting market, every bet is right
 austrailia or south africa kii tiimon ne uskaa ganit gadabadaya bhi he
 Satta Bazaar had opened India's opening price three rupees before the start of the World Cup
 14 tiimon main sabase kam bhav yahi tha
 The team whose lowest price means the strongest contender for victory
 jabaki duusare number par bhav khulaa padosi srilanka kii team kaa
 Whose initial price in the speculative market was 4
 70 rupee
 The last time the World Cup was held in the Indian subcontinent was in 1996, when Sri Lanka named the World Cup
 saal 2007 main hue world cap main bhi srilanka final main pahunchaa tha
 The mathematics of the speculative market was up to this point
 par dakshin africa kii team ne naa sirf uskaa ganit bigaada balki kaaphi nuksaan bhi pahunchaaya
 In fact, far from winning the World Cup, the South African team, which never reached the final, was the third choice of the bookies with a price of five rupees
 dakshin africa kii team 1992, 99 or 2007 main semifinal tak bhi pahunchi thi
 But this time the South African team, known as Choker, got out of New Zealand in the quarter-finals and New Zealand reached the semi-finals instead
 satta bazaar kaa austrailia par bhi daav ulta padaa
 Despite losing the Ashes to England, the bookies, who won the 6-1 ODI series, were also not taking lightly
 chaar baar kii world champion or lagaataar teen world cap jeetne vaali ponting kii team ko 5
 The fourth team to reach the semi-finals with a price of Rs 50 was stated
 par satta bazaar kaa kahana he ki group maichon main ulatpher or australia kii pakistan ke haathon haar ke chalate quarter final kaa linep gadabada gaya
 Due to this, India and Australia came face to face before the semi-finals
 varna australia semifinal main jarur hoti
 That is, India, Sri Lanka, South Africa and Australia were the four teams that reached the semi-finals according to the initial price of the market
 inamen se bharat or srilanka final to yahaan tak pahunch gayi par south africa or austrailia kii jagah newjiland or pakistan semifinal main aa gayi
 That is, the speculative market's claim to the semi-finals was fifty-fifty proved correct
 jabaki final ko lekar sau fisadi
 Now it remains to be seen whether his claim about the World Cup champion also proves to be 100 per cent true or not? It is obvious that those who play Satta Na will also have the same blessing that Satta Bazaar's prediction and the claim will be true in the final
 kyonki maamla us cap he jo puraa india maang rahaa he
 According to 11 players, a total of 254 players from 14 countries showed their jewelery during the World Cup for six weeks
 par satta bazaar kii nigahen jis khilaadi par sabase zyada gadi thim wo the sachin tendulkar
 Satta Bazar claimed six weeks ago that Tendulkar will be the highest run-scorer in the World Cup and it looks like this is really going to happen
 jaraa us drishy par vichaar karen ki, shanivaar ko mumbai ke vankhede stadium main sachin tendulkar apana saunva shatak banaaen or uske baad dhoni haathon main world cap uthaaen
 Of course, nothing can be more beautiful and beautiful than the World Cup
 ye donon hi chijen sambhav hai
 Because Tendulkar has scored 99 centuries in Tests and odis so far and Team India is just a step away from the World Cup
 bas yahi wo cheez he jisane satta bazaar kii sabase zyada chaandi kar rakhi he
 Satta Bazaar has already played its claim on Dhoni after Team India won the cup
 rahi-sahi kasar tendulkar ko saunve shatak par lagane ja rahe bhav ne puri kar di he
 That is, the silver of the speculative market on Saturday is silver
 gauratlab he ki world cap shuru hone se pehle hi satta bazaar ne world cap main sabase behtareen pradarshan karne vaale paanch top ballebaajon or paanch gendbaajon kaa bhav kholaa tha
 Surprisingly, Satta Bazaar had said that Tendulkar would be the highest run-scorer in this World Cup
 isiilie tendulkar kaa bhav rakhaa gaya tha sabase kam do rupee
 Sachin Tendulkar has so far scored 464 runs in the World Cup with two centuries and two half-centuries
 jabaki srilanka ke openar tillakaratne dilashaan ne 467 ran banaae hai
 That means only three runs more than Sachin
 ab ye donon khilaadi shanivaar ko final main aamane saamne honge
 Both will come to open for their respective teams
 yani sachin ke paas puraa mauka hoga satta bazaar kii bhavishwani ko sach sabit karne kaa
 To surpass Dilshan to score the most runs in the World Cup
 jaahir he shanivaar ko khitaabi jeet ke alaava sabase zyada daanv or bhav sachin tendulkar kii shatakon ke shatak par lagane ja rahaa he
 Now think of the team that will win the World Cup of India and put Sachin's hundredth century together and win it will fill his bag
 semifinal main bharat or pakistan kii bhidnt or phir final main team india
 No one could have got a better and golden opportunity to earn for the speculative market
 bas yahi vajah he ki is world cap ne ummid se kahin zyada uski jholii bhar di he
 About sixty thousand crore bets have been played on the current World Cup so far? According to the sources of the speculative market, around 15 thousand crores have been staked on the final match alone
 world cap shuru hone se pehle khud satta bazaar takreeban pachaas hajaar karod daanv par lagane kii ummid lagaae baithe tha
 But due to many small and weak teams in group matches, this figure was not seen to be complete
 phir dakshin africa or austrailia jaisi tiimon ke semifinal se pehle hi baahar ho jane se bhi use kaaphi nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 But then the important semi-final match between India and Pakistan fell in the bag of Satta Bazaar, and it was from here that his fate changed
 ek andaaje ke mutabik akele bharat-paak ke is ek match par kareeb bees hajaar karod rupee idha se udhar ho gaye
 Overall, the eyes of the speculative market are now fixed on the final
 chunki bharat final main he or jeet kaa devadaar bhi, lihaaja satta bazaar final main phenki jane vaali tamaam 600 gendon par noton kii barsaat kii ummid lagaae baitha he
 Thanks for all the concerns
 Everything is as good as it can be just a few broken bones

 Amit Shah, who arrived at an honor ceremony of the Patidar community in Surat, had to face fierce opposition from hearty supporters
 mauka bhaanpate hi is ghatana ke jariye congress ne piem modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko jamkar gheraa
 The Congress cited the stalled policies of the government in the state and the center, linking it to the declining popularity of the PM and BJP
 dilli main congress pravaktaa abhishek manu singhvi ne kaha ki ye koi saadhaaran virodh nahin, balki kisaanon se judaa jan andolan he
 Singhvi said that in a way it is a new revolution, a movement, a tremendous revolt
 gujaratmen inke kaarnon ko jaraa dhyaan se dekhen, jo bahut gambhir he
 It is necessary to analyze it
 'gujarat main kheti kii halaat bahut buree'singhvi ne ek-ek karke gujarat kii kheti se judi naakaamiyon kaa byora diya
 He said that wherever the BJP government has been in the last 20 years, the condition of farming is very bad
 jo patel hai, kisaan hai,patidaarahain, jo ashrith hai bahut bade paimaane par krishi ke upar, wo sab dhakele ja rahe hai
 Employment is not being found in cities and in cities
 ye bina rojgaar vikaas kii jo baat he wo vishesh rup se gujarat model ko aap kah sakate hai jitani prashansa kii gai he uski wo model he- bina rojgaar ke vikaas kaa
 You are witnessing the outrage in various ways
 modi kaal main 5 hajaar se zyada kisaanon kii mautcongress pravaktaa ne kaha ki modi ji ne ye ek mithyaa prachaar kiya, jagah-jagah chunaavon main, gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke rup main ki gujarat main kisaanon kii aatmahatya nahin hoti
 But this did not tell you that the figures tell a different story
 lagbhag 11 varsh kaa jo samaykaal he 2002 se 2012 kaa, usamen saadhe 5 hajaar se zyada kisaanon kii maut hui he
 These are official figures, an attempt was made to hide them
 bijepi shashan main giri growth rate: congressinghvi ne kaha ki aaj lagbhag saadhe 3 lakh kisaanon kii sankhya kam hui he gujarat main
 If you look at the figures as agriculture, then it is very pathetic
 2003 se 2008 tak kai krishi padaarth hai jo shunya nahin balki mines main chale gaye
 If you look at rural inflation, because all these are the reasons for this outrage
 sabase zyada bharat main gramin inflation gujarat main he
 The growth rate during 2013–2014 was 4 percent during the UPA government
 magar endie sarkaar main kheti kaa growth 2014-2015 main rashtriya str par 0

 2015-2016 main 1 pratishat hui he

 pichley kai dinon se aap kisi mahila ke sampark main hai, jab jab aap unke saath hote hai, aapako ajeeb sa sukun mahasoos hota he, unase dur hone par bhi aap mohatarama ke khayalon main hi khoe rahete hai
 And now you have also accepted that you have started liking that girl in your mind
 aap usase apane man kii baat to karnaa chaahate hai, lekin pareshaani is baat kii he ki aapako abhi tak yah samaj nahin aayaa he ki uske man main aapke liye kya chal rahaa he
 You have been in the same dilemma for many days that if you do not lose your relationship with your friend after speaking your mind, then leave now worry
 unke haavbhaav or baatcheet se hi aap yah pataa laga sakate hai ki unke man me aapako lekar kya chal rahaa he
 Know such things from which you can know the state of mind of them
 1- baatcheet ke dauraan is baat par dhyaan den ki vah aapako kis sambodhan se bulaati hai
 If your surname is well-known among your office or friends and they are also aware of your name
 lekin phir bhi agar vah aapako aapke naam se bulaati hai, to janaab vah aap ko dost se kuch zyada maanati hai
 Calling you by surname, she does not want to include herself in your friends list and is unlikely to think in future
 2- aap ek hi offis main kaam karte hai
 And you are well aware that she puts balm on her lips, but she never does this in front of you
 to janaab yah aapke liye acchhee khabar he, kyonki iskaa matlab yah he ki unke man main aapke liye dabi hui bhavanaaen hai
 One thing is certain that if you have ever seen them applying lip balm and she puts lip balm in front of you very easily, then there is no need for her to have any kind of intention, she considers you as her colleague
 3- jab aap unki taraf dekhte hai, to vah akasar apane honton par jeebh pherati hai
 It may be easy to see, but it is proof that she is interested in you
 4- agar aapaki mohatarama ko smoke karnaa pasand nahin he, lekin phir bhi aapke smoke karte samay vah aapse baat karti he yaa aapako akelaa chhod kar nahin jaati, to yakeenan vah bhi aapako pasand karti hai
 5- She often tells you that she resembles a celebrity, so it means that she considers you very hot

 On August 13, a fortnight after getting rid of the Grand Alliance and taking oath as the Chief Minister of Bihar in the company of the BJP, Nitish Kumar arrived at an organ donation camp organized by the Dadhichi Deh Daan Committee (DDDS)
 jab unhone khud ko angadata ke rup main panjikrut karaayaa or avasar aane par netradaan karne kaa vachan diya, tab unke saath is gaiyr-sarkari sanghathan ke sangrakshak khadey the
 It was none other than Bihar's new Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi
 nitish kumaar or susheel modi kii saajhedaari bahut lambey samay se chali aa rahi he, jab susheel patna science college main chaatr the or nitish bihar college of ejineering main pard rahe the
 Both were brilliant students
 nitish ne apni electronics ejineering pariksha safaltaapurvak uteern kii or susheel vanaspati vigyaan main vishvavidhyalay main duusare sthaan par rahe
 "obviously both were studious students," says a senior IAS officer in Patna
 yahi vah cheez he, jise unhone sarkaar main apane drushtikon main bhi shaamil kiya he
 They read every word written in the file themselves
 "donon ne 1974 main jaiprakash narayan ke sampurna kranti andolan main chaatr netaa ke taur par apane rajnatik kariyar kii shuruyaat patna se kii thi
 Sushil became Nitish's deputy in November 2005 and remained until June 2013
 jab 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa daavedaar banaakar bhaajapa ne abhiyaan shuru kiya, to nitish ne uske saath apane rishton ko khatm kar liya
 But even when he left the BJP, Nitish did not let his relationship with Sushil get affected
 farvari 2015 main, jab unhone jithan ram maanjhi ko nishkasit kar diya or khud mukhyamantri banakar laut aae, tab ve apane purv dipti susheel ke saath shapath grahan samaaroh main badi garmjoshi se gale mili
 He had asked, "will it go on like this?" Once again, in November 2015, when he was sworn in after his stunning victory in Bihar, he told Sushil how strongly he felt about his absence in the government
 Huh
 isliye mauka milane par susheel ne nitish kii bhaajapa main vaapasi kii gupt yojana bana di
 He was unleashing layers of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Janata Dal (united) - JD (U) - alliance, targeting Lalu Prasad Yadav and his family (but never Nitish) anyway
 rajd ke saath nitish ke badhate mohabhang ko mahasoos karte hue susheel ne narendra modi or amit shah ko unhen waapas laane ke liye manaa liya
 Sushil Modi told India Today, "now that we have started again, it seems as if we had never separated
" hamaara gathbandhan naiysargik he, hamaari prashasan style ek-duusare ke saath puri lay-taal main he or hamaari kaaryastylee—samay seemaa-sanchalit or lakshya kendrit—ek duusare ke liye poorak he
 "the effect is also visible
 udhaaharan ke liye, sarkaar ke ek varisht mantri kehete hai ki mantrimandal kii baithken ab jeevant ho gai hai
 In the last few days of his alliance with the RJD, Nitish was constantly in a bad mood
 sarkaar ke ek mantri ne kaha, ''ab nitishaji mantrimandaleey baithkon ke dauraan aksar muskaraate rahete hai, or ek-do baar majaak bhi kar lete hai
 "this is the first time in two decades that the same coalition is in power at the Center and in the state
 pichhali baar aisa 1997 main tab hua tha, jab lalu bihar par shashan karte the, or indra kumaar gujral nai dilli main janata dal sarkaar kaa netritv kar rahe the
 Yet now the pace of the state has changed
 bhaajapa ke saath apane pichley gathbandhan ke dauraan, shashan or raajnneeti, donon main spasht taur par nitish badhat banaae hue the
 From taking a larger share (four out of six) of the Rajya Sabha seats and contesting more seats in the Lok Sabha and in the assembly, (in 141 seats in 2010), Nitish was in command
 ab kya haal he
 
 
 At the moment, Nitish may still be on the run in governance in the state — the administration and home department are still under him, and the chief minister has direct control over IAS and IPS officers — but as far as political decisions for the alliance When it comes to taking over, the modi-shah-led BJP has become more vocal
 nae rajya mantrimandal kii sanrachana se bhi yah baat kaaphi saaf ho jaati he
 The cabinet has a total of 29 members including the Chief Minister
 jad(you) kaa hissaa bada he or uske paas 15 mantri hai, jabaki bhaajapa ke paas 13 mantri hai jo pichhali sarkaar main rajd ke mantriyon kii sankhya se ek zyada he
 One minister belongs to LJP
 jab jad(you) or bhaajapa ne 2010 main pichhali baar rajya main gathbandhan sarkaar banaai thi to us samay bhaajapa ke 11 hi mantri sarkaar main the jabaki uske 91 vidhayak chunaav jite the, jabaki is baar to uske paas 53 hi vidhayak hai
 Even before that in 2005-10, BJP had seven ministers in the JD (U) -bjp's first coalition government, with 55 mlas
 jaahir he ki in tamaam varshon main mantrimandal main bhaajapa kii maujuudagi lagaataar badhati gai he
 As far as Lok Sabha elections are concerned, when JD (U) and BJP last contested in 2009, JD (U) fielded 25 candidates and BJP 15
 lekin 2014 main aakar sthiti ekadam ulat gai
 Now BJP has 22 Lok Sabha members from Bihar and Nitish has only two
 jaahir he ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bhaajapa kaa siton ke bantwaare main zyada dakhal rahegaa
 In fact, last week when party president Amit Shah called a meeting of the core members of the Bihar BJP, he aggressively campaigned and asked to strengthen the party to the booth level so that he could win all 40 Lok Sabha seats on his own
 Could
 ise nitish ko haashiye par dhakelne vaale kadam ke taur par dekha ja rahaa tha
 However, Sushil Modi tweeted this as an attempt to reassure Nitish Kumar that there was no discussion on seat sharing in the core group meeting
 chunautiyaan or bhi hai, jaise ki khud susheel modi bataate hai, ''sabase badi chunauti to logon kii apeksha he
 When we started in 2005, there was a completely passive system in Bihar
 koi lakshya nahin tha, naukarshahon ke liye koi dedline nahin thi or na hi jamini str par kaam kii koi vyavastha thi
 In the next eight years, our government established a system
 karmchaariyon ko naukari par rakhaa or kadi nigaraanee rakhi
 Gave new vision to bureaucrats and set new targets for them
 " yakeenan nitish kumaar or susheel modi ko us samay bihar main badlaav ke shilpakaaron ke taur par dekha gaya
 Nitish Kumar kept his focus on formulating new vision for Bihar and giving good governance, while Sushil Modi focused on administration and financial management
 susheel modi kaa kahana he ki ab samay ''aage kii taraf lambii chalaang lagane kaa he kyonki keval thodi-thodi behatari se log ab santusht nahin honge
 "as an example, in 2005 (when the nitish-bjp partnership started) the state plan size was Rs 4,465 crore
 tha jo 2016-17 main badhkar 1
 6 lakh crore Rs
 ho gaya
 According to the Central Statistical Organization, 11 of Bihar's GDP in the five-year period from 2004-05 to 2008-09
 03 fisadi kii badhotaree hui jisase us avadhi main vah gujarat ke baad desh main sabase teji se viksit hone vaali arthvyavastha ban gaya
 7 of Bihar in the mid-term (during 2011-12 to 2016-17)
 6 fisadi kii vikaas dar 6
 Better than the national growth rate of 8 percent
 lalu prasad yadav ke shasankaal ke ant main yani 2004-05 main rajya kaa sakal gharelu utpaada 77,781 karod rupye tha
 When Nitish Kumar took over, it increased to Rs 82,490 crore that year
 jab 2013 main unhone bhaajapa se rishte tode to, jiesdipi 3,43,663 karod ru
 It was done in 2013-14
 phir 2015-16 main rajya kaa jiesdipi 4,13,503 karod ru tha
 After bringing Bihar so far, the Nitish Kumar and Sushil Modi duo will have to think about their next innings
 haalanki sushasan ab bhi sarvocch praathamikta hogi
 On 19 September, Nitish Kumar, in a meeting with the surveillance department first and then two days later with the top police officers, made it clear that they either get ready or tie their bags
 ek police adhikari ne bataaya ki mukhyamantri ne is janvari se agast ke aparaadh ke aankadon kii tulana pichley saal isi avadhi ke aparaadh ke aankadon se kii or police adhikariyon se sidhe sawaal puche
 It is clear that now after becoming the main opposition party, after the RJD accused Nitish Kumar of defying the 2015 mandate, the challenge before the Chief Minister is much bigger and clearer
 patna main ek iees adhikari kaa kahana he, ''lekin nitish or susheel ke liye bhi abhi yah shuruaati daur hi he
 It has been only two months
 koi bhi bada badlaav laane ke liye yah bahut thodaa hi samay he, khaastaur par jab unhen kaam sambhalate hi baadh kii sthiti or srijan ghotaale se jujhna padaa
 But the honesty with which both work and the information Sushil Modi keeps in governance, will surely give a meaningful direction to the state under his leadership
 "udhaaharan ke taur par bhagalpur sthit enjio mahila sahyog samiti ke 1,300 karod rupye kii sarkari raashi hajam kar jane vaale srijan ghotaale main sibiai jaanch ke aadesh die jane se pehle hi susheel modi ne sabhi pramukh sachivon, ayuktaon or jila magistriton ko nirdesh de diya ki ve sabhi sarkari khaaton ko turant apadet karen or vitt vibhaag ko har maheene uskaa hisaab bheja jaae
 The finance department is held by Sushil Modi and a separate desk will monitor the flow of all funds
 ukt iees adhikari kaa kahana tha, ''susheel modi ke chalate nitish sarkaar main kya antar aayaa he, is baat ko tabhi samajha ja saktaa he jab ham ise lalu ke rajd ke sahyog se nitish kii ore se chalaai ja rahi sarkaar kii prishthbhumi main dekhen
 Nitish and Lalu were never of an opinion
 niyamon or swatchta par nitish ke jor ke vipareet lalu jo man main aae, vah turant karne vaali pravriti ke the
 From talking to the jailed Shahabuddin over the phone to meeting the rape-accused RJD MLA at his government residence, from directing the police inspector in a criminal case to ordering a civil surgeon, Lalu has given Nitish several times Uncomfortable
 darasal, darbhanga ke civil sarjan ne to ek patr tak likh diya tha jisamen kuch theka karmchaariyon ko behaal karne ke lalu ke maukhik aadesh ko uddhrut kiya gaya tha
 In March, an RJD minister was accused of going to a diamond cutting and polishing unit in Patna to put pressure on him
 mantri ke daure ke baad us ikai ne utpaadan hi band kar diya

 The danger is to your lungs, but you look ill sent
 dilli kii hawa ko lekar jo baaten ho rahi hai wo behad niraash karne vaali hai
 The people of Delhi are watching the debate in Delhi as if people are facing pollution in the cities like if someone has hung the jalebi in the air, that if Meerut and Banaras will also fall
 jalebi res yaad he aapako
 So even in Delhi, court orders, statements of ministers and articles printed in newspapers could not do anything
 aisa nahin tha ki is saal hi hawa ke kharaab hone kii khabar ai
 Surely this year i
e
 on November 4, the Air Quality Index in Delhi is 497
 teen saal main sabase adhik
 There is an average of 32 stations
 hona chahie 50 se kam lekin 497 he
 In 2016, Delhi had 5 air monitoring stations
 ab 32 hai
 Indian Express as on 31 March 2015
 tab express ne karaab ho chuki hawa ko lekar apni taraf se padtaal kii thi
 The headline of the express was that everyone saw seven years ago, how the wind of Delhi is changing its deadly attitude but nobody did anything
 aniruddh ghoshaal or prutha chatterjee kii report ab hawa ho chuki he magar mehnat se kii gai is report main dilli main hue 15 adhyayanon ke aadhaar par kaha tha ki 1998 main sienji lagu hone ke baad dilli kii hawa ko jo phaayde hue the wo gaayab hone vaale hai
 But no one paid attention
 yani dilli main hawa kaa kharaab hona 2008 main hi shuru ho chukaa tha
 According to the figures of the Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute in this report, the number of OPD cases in 2003-04 was 51,694 which was reduced to 47,887 in 2006-7
 lekin 2013-14 main 65,122 ho gai
 There was never so much
 tab shila dikshit ne kaha tha ki kai tarah kii lobby he
 Had to go through those lobbies
 isi report ke agle din yani 1 april 2015 ke express main ek or report chhapi
 This report stated that the number of sick patients due to air pollution in the ICU of Sardar Patel Chest Institute in Delhi has increased by 11 times
 ames ke respretary department kii opidi main 2005-06 ke mukaable 2014-16 main 300 pratishat bad gaya tha
 In 2013, AIIMS was forced to form a separate respiratory department as it was earlier treated in the chest department itself
 isliye express kii hedline lagaai, live dely
 Leave Delhi is report main bataaya gaya ki 9-10 saal ke bachche ke fefde itane kamazor ho chuke hai jaise danaadan cigarette pine waalon ke fefde hua karte hai
 People have started getting serious illnesses
 saans kaa system kamazor hone laga he
 a doctor's statement printed that earlier, at any age, the lungs were expected to work 80 percent, and now 60 percent works due to air pollution
 bacchon ke doctor ne isi report main kaha tha ki ginati nahin he ki kitne bacchon ke liye medical certificate likhe hai
 So it took you the year of 2015 to know that this situation has not arisen today
 2015 main hi centre for science and envyranment ne ek report prakashit kii thi ki dilli main har saal das se tees hazaar log vaayu pradooshan ke kaaran mar jate hai
 It is 2019
 itani sirius report ke baad bhi ham kareeb kareeb zero kii sthiti par khadey hai
 Not only this, in 2016, air pollution became so dangerous in 2016, which had never happened in 17 years
 yaad dilaanaa zaruri he ki taaki aap sawaal kar saken ki aaj jo aap dekh rahe hai vahi nautanki dekh rahe hai yaa isamen is baar nai nautanki ai he
 Come from 2015 and come in November of 2019, you will know that things are happening
 koi is par bahes nahin kar rahaa he ki pradooshan ko rokane yaa paryaavaran ke liye bane niyamon ko lagu karne ke liye dilli sarkaar ke paas zyada adhikaar he yaa centre sarkaar ke paas
 It is happening in Delhi but nothing is happening in Delhi itself
 fefda aapkaa he or wo vot dene nahin jaataa he
 If it is bad then it goes to the ICU where the leader does not come
 mantri nahin aata he
 See the condition of Banaras
 yahaan piem 2
 Level 5 of 500 reached
 25 se kam hona chahie
 The Prime Minister has a parliamentary constituency
 kya banaras main paraali jal rahi he, somvaar ko yahaan chaar baje piem 2
 5 479 Done
 pradhanmantri modi abhi bainkak main he jahaan 2019 main jab air clavity index 170 pahunchaa tha tab vahaan 400 se adhik skool ek hafte ke liye band kar die gaye
 The Prime Minister of Thailand told the Bangkok governor to take out the notice and close the schools
 logon ko khun kii khaansee aane lagi thi
 Remember the air quality index in Bangkok crossed 170
 banaras main somvaar kaa air quality kaa index 362 he
 The Air Quality Index of Patna, the great capital of Bihar, is 382
 dilli main cricket match ho rahaa tha jab air quality index kai jagahon par 999 tha
 The average was reduced to 494
 jo 6 november 2016 ke baad sabase adhik ausat ricard kiya gaya
 Delhi was supposed to be closed by law, but people were watching a cricket match
 fefde ke liye kharaab hawa main match dekhne vaali janata se ham ummid kar rahe hai wo jaagruk ho gai he
 Arriving at the cricket stadium, the public has told that in the way the government does not matter, we do not even get that way
 duniya kaa koi or desh hota to sabake fefde kii jaanch ho rahi hoti
 The government gives notifications not to do any activity outside in the late evening, but in the evening there is a cricket match
 jab netaa aapako hindi main bargalaayein to use hindi main hi samajhane kaa prayaas kiijie
 Do not look at this question at the level of Delhi alone
 un shaharon kaa bhi hisaab rakhie jahaan kaa air quality index dilli jitna hi kharaab he
 According to Sunday's data, seven of the ten polluted cities in India are from UP
 somvaar ko kanpur main air quality index 435 ho gaya
 Even more than Banaras
 dopaher 12 baje se lekar 4 baje tak piem 2
 5 was 500
 kaayade se kanpur band ho janaa chahie tha
 In the month of March, there was a report that seven of the 10 most polluted cities in the world were from India
 inamen se chah shahar dilli ke aas-paas ke the
 Gurugram, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Bhiwadi and Noida
 tab hamane kya kar liya tha
 The Air Quality Index of Faridabad on November 4 is 397 which is very poor
 bagpat dilli se 55 kimi dur he vahaan par air clality index 500 ho gaya tha
 Not only this, PM2
 5 maapne kaa jo paimaana tay kiya he wo duniya main kaaphi karaab mana jaataa he
 Even after this, our condition is bad
 kahin aisa na ho ki sarkaar piem 2
 5 Increase the standard of fixing and declare the situation as normal
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke anusaar piem 2
 Standard one cubic meter of 5 Ten micro grams PM2 in air
 5 se zyada nahin hona chahie
 In the US it is 12 micro grams and in most developed and developing countries one micro cubic meter of PM2 per cubic meter of air
 5 ke aas paas hi maanak tay hai
 40 grams of Pem 2 in a cubic meter of air in India
 5 maanya he
 That is, the air level is worse than the WHO scale
 dilli or aas paas kii sarkarein daawa karti hai ki unhone ye kiya wo kiya lekin supreme court main sunwaayee ke dauraan uthe sawaalon or court kii tippaniyon se pataa chalata he ki agar kuch hua hi hota to court ko yah na kahana padataa he ki ab jeene kaa adhikaar daanv par he
 The Supreme Court said that we cannot live in this kind of environment
 ham sab apane jivan kaa hissaa khote ja rahe hai
 It is destroying humanity
 ye jeene ke adhikaar kaa ulanghan kar rahaa he
 How can the straw be controlled? dilli main kachra jalaane kii bhi badi samasya he
 Identification of those responsible is important
 unase hamaari koi sahanubhuti nahin he
 Things are worse than emergency
 isse behatar to immergency acchhee he
 People are dying, screaming
 court ne ek line main yah baat kahkar tivi kii bahes khatm kar di ki vibhinn rajya sarkarein or sarkari nikaay pradooshan ko niyantrit karne main asafal rahi hai
 The Supreme Court and High Court orders are not followed
 jab court ke aadesh kaa hi paalan nahin ho rahaa he tab phir ham bahes hi kyon kar rahe hai
 It would have been nice if the Supreme Court also held anyone personally responsible for this, in the same way the village head has been held personally responsible in the case of burning stubble
 kaash nijee taur par jimmedaar paryaavaran mantri or sachiv ko bhi tehraaya jaataa
 However, the court said that no farmer can seek protection for burning stubble
 mukhya sachiv, zila collector, tehsil, police afasar sabaki jimmedaari he ki paraali nahin jaale
 The SHO and the village head will make a list of the burners
 gram pradhan bhi nijee taur par zimmedaar hoga
 The Supreme Court also raised strict questions with the Delhi government
 poocha ki public transport ke liye kuch nahin kiya
 It was said to bring 3000 buses but 300 came
 airport ke metro main koi safar nahin karata
 The Supreme Court has sought arguments and figures regarding aud-even
 pehle ke sam-visham skim ke aankadon kaa byora kya he
 Car pool i
e
 four people traveling in a car, then the government should be encouraged
 emicas curi aparajita singh ne kaha ki dilli main industry or khule main kachra jalaane se 60 pratishat pradooshan hota he or court ke aadesh ke baavjood nirmaan kaary chalata rahata he
 Smoke emits when the generator runs due to power loss
 supreme court ne dilli ensiaar main agle aadesh tak ke liye deazal janarator par bain laga diya he
 Construction work is banned
 court ne kaha he ki dilli punjab haryana or upi main bijli na kate taaki log janarator istamaal na karen
 IIT Kanpur has a report
 dilli main koyale se jalane vaale tandoor se bhi pradooshan failata he
 In 2015 itself, advocate Sudhir Mishra filed a petition in the Delhi High Court regarding these questions
 supreme court ke aadesh to haal philhal ke liye hai
 It has come when things have worsened
 kya agle saal bhi aisa hi hoga
 What is it for cities outside Delhi
 kya fefda sirf dilli ke logon main hota he? kya hawa sirf paraali ke kaaran kharaab hoti he
 a person came to see us
 mirza aarif
 They say that our cars have tires, they are also terrible pollution
 tair kaa rabar ghis kar saanson ke zarie fefde main jaataa he to vahaan gadde kar detaa he
 Another question is formed in this debate
 supreme court ne kaha ki hawa kharaab he
 The right to live is being violated
 tab court ko yah aadesh dena chahie ki sarkarein har us naagarik ko air purifire kaa paisa waapas karen jinhen majabuuran khareednaa padaa
 Due to the failure of the government, people have to buy air purifiers of ten to thirty thousand
 court aankada maange ki november ke pehle hafte main sirf dilli main kitne sau karod ke air purifaire bike hai
 At least the court will know how much the public paid out of the pocket of the government's failure
 kuch hona to nahin kam se kam paise hi waapas mil jaaen
