 You must have sold your old smartphone
 bechney se pehle use riset bhi kiya hoga
 But have you thought that the buyer can recover deleted personal photos, videos and other important data from your smartphone again

 lekin isse bachaa ja saktaa he
 If you are selling your smartphone then you need to be careful
 sirf factory riset kar lene se aapkaa data ricover nahin hoga aisa samajhnaa galat he
 So before you sell these methods, clean the data of your smartphone so that the buyer does not miss your data
 sabase pehle bathpasmartphone bechney se pehle tamaam data ko apane computer main byaap rakh len
 It would be better to save the date in an external drive

 After encrypting you will do the same thing as before
 lekin jab iskaa data ricover kiya jayega to wo encripted hoga
 Factory encrypt it by encrypting the phone and keep in mind Clean Wipe should be there
 aisa karne ke baad aapkaa data ricover karnaa logon ke liye mushkil hoga
 There are many apps on the Google Play Store that claim to delete personal data from smartphones

 On account of this, the removable data can also be deleted in the event of loss of smartphone
 aakhri tareekasbakuch delit kar diya he phir bhi aap shyor nahin hai ki aapkaa data khatm hua he yaa nahin to ek kaam karen
 By resetting your smartphone, fill it with fake files, also known as junk data
 iske baad encript karen or dubaara se factory riset karen
 Now even if the data is recovered, the junk file will be in the hands of others and your important data will never be recovered

 The politics of Bihar is governed by innumerable equations, so the pre-election assessment becomes a crook for the Maharashtrians too
 phir bhi kayaason kii dilachasp koshishen hoti hi hai
 Be it Nitish or Kamal Khile, this time the Bihar election is of national importance
 agar isamen aapaki dilchaspee bhi he or tivi kii bahason or kayaaspurn akhabaari lekhon se man ub gaya he to kitabon kaa rukh kariye
 Not much, there are only 6 books, which by reading you can become 'gyani Baba' of Bihar Politics
 1
 Subaltern Sahib Writer: Sankarshan Thakur Prakashan: Pan Macmillan India Price: Rs 275 This book is the story of a man who became the new hero of the backward in modern Bihar and also made headlines due to his sense of humor
 25 saal pehle jab lalu prasad yadav pehali baar bihar ke mukhyamantri bane, tab se yah kursi kisi savarna ke paas nahin gai he
 He reversed the caste equations in the state, but his rule was also surrounded by allegations of jungle raj and corruption
 ab is chunaav main unki raajnneetik viraasat daanv par lagi he
 This book by journalist Sankarshan Tha Kur was first published in 2001 under the name 'the Making of Lalu Yadav: The Unmaking of Bihar', later its updated version came under the name 'subaltern Saheb'
 'sarrltern' shabd kaa matlab un jan-samoohon se he jo saamaajik-raajnneetik or bhugolic taur par satta ke taqatvar dhaanche se achoote rahe
 Thus a contradictory political change is found in the term 'subaltern Saheb'
 kitaab ke dauraan kai jagah aap hansenge or kai jagah dukhi honge
 But eventually it will be known what effect Lalu brand politics has on people
 2
 Single Man: The Life and Time of Nitish Kumar of Bihar Author: Shankarshan Thakur Prakashkar: Harper Collins India Price: Rs 433 This is the second book by the writer Shankarshan Thakur which tells the story of another popular backward leader of Bihar, named Nitish Kumar

 How this era created a leader who made a possible unbalanced, but effective mix of development promises and caste equations in Bihar's political equations and one day challenged the most popular leader, Narendra Modi
 nitish ke vyaktitv ke itar yah kitaab bihar kii ek andruni tasviir bhi dikhaati he
 Even from that Bihar, where you are forcefully expelled, he does not leave you

 It will help Geoffrey Vitso's book 'democracy Against Development'
 ' aupniveshik bharat ke baad pichhadi jatiyon kii raajnneeti or raajnneetik aadhuniktaa iskaa vishay he

 haalia loktantric lamabandi or vicasonmukhi nitiyon ke bich vah paraspar virdohi sambandhon ko rekhaankit karte hai
 Vittso writes how the colonial era played a role in establishing an existing ethnic identity
 vitso desh ke sabase garib pradesh bihar main pichhadon kii raajnneeti ke ubhaar kaa, uski simaaon kii andekhi kiye bina vishleshan karte hai or bataate hai ki kaise is ghatnakram ne aarthik vikaas ke liye jameen taiyaar kii, jo aaj bihar chunaav main bada mudda ban gaya he

 On the one hand, Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal is on the streets against note ban
 vahiin sansad main is mudde par unki party kii awaz kamjor pad rahi he
 Party's outspoken MP Bhagwant Mann has been advised by Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan not to participate in the proceedings of the House for two more weeks
 iske saath hi unhone sansad kii suraksha vyavastha ko lekar bhagwant maan ke video kii jaanch kar rahi bijepi saansad kirit somaiyya kii adhyakshata vaali samiti kaa kaarykaal bhi do hafte badha diya he
 Significantly, the Aam Aadmi Party has four mps in the Lok Sabha, out of which two mps, Dharmveer Gandhi and Harinder Singh Khalsa, have been suspended by the Aam Aadmi Party for anti-party activities
 jabaki bhagwant maan pichley puure satr main sadan kii kaarywahi main hissaa nahin le sake the
 Now the responsibility of raising the voice of the Aam Aadmi Party is on the lone lone MP of the party, Professor Sadhu Singh
 rajyasabha main abhi aam aadmi party kaa koi saansad nahin he
 The problem of the Aam Aadmi Party is also that it wanted to raise many major issues related to Punjab in the Winter Session of Parliament happening just before the Punjab Assembly elections
 inamen yamuna sutluj link nahar ko lekar supreme court kaa faisla, nashaabandi ko lekar rajya sarkaar kii bhoomika jaise mahatvapurn mudde shaamil hai

 in kaarnon par gaur karne ke baad unhone samiti ko 19 november se do saptaah kaa samay or dene kaa nirnay liya he
 At the same time, he has advised Bhagwant Mann that he should not participate in the proceedings of the House until the committee's report comes

 While Bhagwant Mann could not participate in the proceedings of the House in the last full session
 ab aam aadmi party kii aawaaj buland karne kii jimmedaari party ke akele bache saansad professor sadhu singh par he
 There is currently no MP for the Aam Aadmi Party in the Rajya Sabha
 aam aadmi party kii dikkat yah bhi he ki vah punjab vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle ho rahe sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main punjab se jude kai pramukh muddon ko uthaanaa chaah rahi thi
 These include important issues like the Supreme Court's decision on the Yamuna Sutlej Link Canal, the state government's role in prohibition
 punjab vidhansabha ke chunaav farvari march main prastaavit hai
 However, then the budget session of Parliament will be going on because this time the budget session will start a month in advance, but then the issues related to the budget are likely to dominate
 tippaniyan On July 25, Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan formed a committee of nine mps under the chairmanship of Kirit Somaiya
 tab kai saansadon ne shikaayat kii thi ki bhagwant maan ne sansad kii suraksha ke saath khilwaad kiya kyonki unhone andar ke sanvadensheel drishyon ko soshal media par saarvajanik kar diya tha
 This committee was to submit its report today
 spikar ne aaj kaha ki unhen samiti ke adhyaksh kii ore se aavedan mila he ki samiti ko apni report taiyaar karne ke liye do saptaah kaa samay or chahie
 After considering these reasons, they have decided to give two more time to the committee from 19 November
 saath hi, unhone bhagwant maan ko salaah di he ki jab tak samiti kii report na aae, unhen sadan kii kaarywahi main hissaa nahin lenaa chahie
 The term of the Kirit Committee has been extended for the third time

 The film was already in the news due to the intimate scenes shown in the film's trailer
 is baat kaa bhi ilm tha hi ki film ke lav mekking seens par sensor board kii kanchi chalegi hi
 But the censor board said something about the film which is difficult to believe
 kuch din pehle hi navazuddin siddiki starofilm 'babumoshaay bandookbaaj'ke mekars ne film ko sensor board main certification ke liye bheja tha
 After screening the film, the censor board decided to give the film an a rating and pass the film with 48 cuts
 lekin had tab ho gai jab sensor board kamity kii ek member ne 'babumoshaay bandookbaaj' film kii produsar kiran shroff kii beijjati kerani shuru kar di
 Film producer Kiran Shroff said in an interview to Bombay Times that when the censors were counting the reasons for the cuts in the board film, a female member sitting in the board meeting turned towards me and said, how can you make such films as a woman
 kiran shroff isse pehle kuch bolti ki kamity main baitha ek shaks bolaa, lekin ye aurat he hi nahin, dekhen inhone kaise kapade pahane hai
 'please tell that Kiran Shroff was wearing a simple paint shirt dress during this time

 maujuuda kulapati or purv ipies adhikari vibhuti narayan raay kaa kaarykaal isi maheene puraa ho rahaa he, lekin unhone dobaaraa is pad par kabiz hone ke liye lobing tej kar di he
 As a result of his lobbying, Rai's name has been included in the panel to be sent to the President despite strong opposition from the search committee chairman Ashok Vajpayee and his controversial tenure
 search cameti ne nae kulapati ke liye paanch naamon ke panel ko hari jhandi di he, jisamen sabase pehla naam sangh lok seva ayog ke purv sadsy purushottam agarwal kaa he, jabaki doosraa naam prasiddh bhashavid or vishwa bharti ke pro vaais chancelar udai narayan singh kaa he
 The third name in the panel is Radha Vallabh Tripathi, considered the most senior Sanskrit professor and currently Vice Chancellor of Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan (deemed University)
 jabaki duusare kaarykaal ke liye har jatan main jute vibhuti narayan raay kaa naam chauthe sthaan par he
 Girishwar Mishra, a psychology professor at Delhi University, has been named as the fifth name
 search cameti ke chairman ashok vaajapeyi ne india today se baatcheet main gopneeyata kii vajah se kisi naam kaa khulaasa karne se inkaar kiya, lekin puche jane par unhone paanch naamon kaa panel hone or inamen se ek naam par ‘decent note’ (asahmati patr) kii pushti kii
 According to sources, Vajpayee opposed the inclusion of Vibhuti Narayan Rai's name in the panel, but after the search committee member Kapila Vatsyayan insisted, Vajpayee gave the name to the panel with a descent note
 sutron ke mutabik, raay ne apana naam panel main shaamil karwaane ke liye pichley maheene do baar kolkata kaa daura kiya or vatsayayan ke bhai keshav malik se mulaakaat kii thi or keshav malik ko wardha bulaakar bhi unki khub aavbhagat kii gai
 Confident of Rai's reappointment, one of his supporters at the university says that Vibhuti Narayan has also approached President Pranab Mukherjee's MP son Abhijeet Mukherjee for lobbying
 jahaan unhen kaha gaya tha ki pehle panel main apana naam shaamil karvaa len
 Sources reveal that after this confidence, Rai threw all his strength to include his name in the panel
 search cameti ke adhyaksh vaajapeyi raashtrapati ke nomini the, jabaki sadsy ke taur par kapila vatsayayan auramanagement guru preetam singh shaamil the
 Will the President dismiss the disagreement of his nominee? Now the question arises whether President Pranab Mukherjee will reject the search committee chairman Ashok Vajpayee's dissent note
 vaajapeyi raashtrapati ke nomini ke taur par search cameti kii adhyakshata kar rahe the
 Vajpayee expresses his disagreement on Rai's name and has taken a detailed note
 philhal nae kulapati ke liye paanch naamon ke panel vaala gopneey lipapha maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ke paas he or vaajapeyi ke decent note par mantralay apni kya raay detaa he, vah bhi raashtrapati ke nirnay main mahatvapurn hoga
 However, the student struggle committee, which is fighting against the irregularities of the Hindi University, fears that the Ministry may not send the descent note to the President, as the former has been torn once in the matter of the appointment of a professor
 
 rajnatik dabaab banane kii koshishdesh kaa ekmaatr antarrashtriya hindi vishvavidhyalay apane makasad main abhi tak kaamyaab nahin ho sakaa he
 Some time ago Rai, in a conversation with India Today, blamed his former vice-chancellors Ashok Vajpayee and Gopinathan for being behind the university
 unhone to yahaan tak kaha tha ki sahitya jagat main is baat kii bahes honi chahie ki kyon na is vishvavidhyalay ko band kar diya jaae

 But despite the controversies, Rai does not appear to leave the vice-chancellor's chair easily

 The search committee sealed the envelope while fixing the panel on 7 October, but the following day, on 8 October, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court issued a notice to the Maharashtra government along with Rai and other officials of the university in the fake migration certificate case

 On Thursday, when Delhi Police Chief Amulya Patnaik was showing crime statistics in the annual press conference, at the same time, 6 Havans were together in the Mandavali area of the capital to carry out a gang rape with an innocent minor girl
 purvi dilli ke mandawali ilaake main ek children park he
 Where 6 boys together gang-rape of 14-year-old girl in the guard room
 darasal, 9veen class main padhane valichatra park mengum rahi thi
 At the same time, three boys, Sachin Gurjar, Srikanth and Harish, befriended the minor girl and then began to turn her around
 shaam hone lagi to sachin ne apane 3 or doston ko vahaan park main bula liya
 Then all these 6 boys took the girl to the guard room of the park and in turn raped the minor girl
 uske baad aropiyon ne ladki ko dhamkee dete hue kaha ki agar is bare main kisi ko bataaya to ve use maar daalenge
 The girl was scared and returned to her home
 jab usase rahaa nahin gaya to usne apane mata-pita ko aapbeetee suna di
 On hearing that, the senses of the family were blown away
 ve fouran ladki ko lekar thana mandawali pahunche or vahaan jaakar gangrape kaa mukadmaa darj karvaa diya
 After this, the police took immediate action and arrested all the accused one by one
 pakade jane par aropiyon ne bataaya ki unhen fansaaya gaya he, ladki jhooth bol rahi he
 When she tried to talk to the victim, she avoided talking on camera
 philhal police ne sabhi 6 aropiyon ko tihaad jail bhej diya he
 According to police, the boys have gangraped with a minor on the pretext of friendship
 jiske chalate ipisi kii dhara 376 / 506 / 4 / 12 or poxo act ke tahat mukadmaa darj kiya gaya he
 After the first train of Tejas, the most modern train in the country, the railway is now preparing to give cheap headphones to the train after the headphone theft and tampering of the TV screen on the seat
 angreji akhbaar hindustan times main chhapi khabar ke mutabik IRCTC iske liye ek hajaar headfones kaa order de diya he jisamen prayek kii keemat sirf 30 rupye he
 In Tejas, the first headphones were provided for travelers, each headphone was priced at Rs 200
 lekin train ke saamaan ke saath todphod or chori kii ghatnaon ke baad ab railway yatriyon kosasta saamaan uplabdh karaaneki disha main aage bad rahaa he
 During Tejas' first visit, 337 headphones were stolen
 bhartiya railway kii tejas train ke safar par ravaanaa hone se pehle bhi updraviyon ne pathar maar kar train ke shishe tod die the
 Tejas made the first journey from Mumbai to Goa on 22 May
 train ko jameen par hawaii safar jaisaa anubhav bataaya ja rahaa he
 The entire train is air-conditioned as well as all the doors in the train are automatic
 train kii 13 yatri bogiyon main kul 990 siten hai
 It also includes an executive coach, which also has the facility to lie on the seats
 railway ne train ke saamaan ko saath hui chhedchhad ke baad sisitivi camaron ko bhi khangaalane shuru kar diya he
 Let us tell you that the Tejas train running at a speed of 200 kilometers per hour has all the hi-tech facilities like metro
 yatriyon ke manoranjan ke liye elidi screen se lekar bogiyon main sisitivi camere bhi lagaae gaye hai
 Twenty-six May 2016 would probably be a more appropriate date for Narendra Modi's assessment
 isliye nahin ki us din sarkaar do saal puure karegi balki isliye ki us din tak yah tay ho jayega ki modi ne bharat ke madhya varg or yuva ko thos dhang se kya saunpa he jo bijepi kii palki kii apane kandhe par yahaan tak laayaa he? modi sarkaar kii sabase badi gafalat yah nahin he ki vah pehle hi saal main kisaanon va gaanvon se cat gai
 The villages were neither a part of bjp's political arithmetic nor did Modi's election campaign focus on villages
 modi ke liye zyada badi chintaa yuva va madhya varg kii apekshaayen hai jinhone unki raajnneeti ko nayaa aayam diya he or pehle varsh main modi inke liye kuch nahin kar sake
 Employment and inflation are the most worn-out debates of Indian governance, but in both of these cases, Modi also has the highest expectations of breaking leaks as unprecedented mandate against Congress sparked five years of inflation and new unemployment that emerged after 2008
 modi sarkaar kii pehali saalagirah par bhaashanon ko sunate or vigyapanon ko padhate hue, agar mutmain karne vaale sabase kam tark aapako inhen do muddon par mili to chaunkiega nahin
 Remember the crowds of youths attending Modi's election rallies last summer
 kaise bhul sakate hai aap pados ke pariwaron main modi ke samarthan kii uttejk bahasein? yah bijepi kaa paaramparik voter nahin tha
 It was a middle class equipped with socialist and liberal experimentation experiences that took Modi's message to the villages and lower classes
 yakeenan, ek saal main modi se jaadu kii ummid kisi ko nahin thi lekin lagbhag har duusare din bolte sune gaye or bacchon se lekar drug adict tak se man kii baat karne vaale pradhanmantri kii rojgaron par chuppi apratyaashit thi
 Modi's silence was a result of the government's inaction on his jobs
 darasal, sthaayee, asthaayee, nijee, sarkari va swarozgaar, sabhi ayaamon par 2015 main rojgaron kaa haal 2014 se bura ho gaya
 The Labor Bureau reported this April that the employment generation rate in the eight major industries is at the lowest level of the quarter
 fasal kii barbaadi or rojgaar kaarykram rukne se gaanv or bure haal main hai
 The government will elevate skill development in praise of successes, but according to the skill department, the highest employment (6 crore annually) comes from building construction, retail and transport
 in kshetron main mandi naapane ke liye aapako aarthik visheshgy hone kii jarurat nahin he
 Real estate is in a trough, the government does not want to open the retail market and demand for transport is dependent on both of them
 darasal, duusare mishan intjaar kar sakate the alabatta rojgaron ke liye nai sujh se las mishan kii hi apeksha thi
 Now that the monsoon is frightening and global agencies are about to reduce India's growth targets, it is going to be very difficult for Modi to get millions of unemployed youth tied to his campaign over the next one year
 haal main petrol or dijal kii keemten jab apane contile str par laut ain or mausam kii maar ke baad jaruri chizon ke daam nai oonchai chune lage to madhya va nichle varg ko sirf yahi mahasoos nahin hua ki kismat kii meharbaani khatm ho gai balki isse zyada gaharaa ehsaas yah tha ki is sarkaar ke paas bhi jindagi jeene kii laagat ko kam karne kii koi sujh nahin he
 Remember the discussion of the Modi model of tackling inflation? There was a lot of dialogue on this during the election
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke taur par modi kii ek report kaa hawala diya gaya
 Thoughts of stopping inflation were floating in the air instead of supply
 keemton main teji rokane ke liye price stabligeshan fund ko sarkaar ne apni 'taqatvar' sujh kaha tha
 However, this fund, announced in July 2014, was formed in May 2015 and that too only Rs 500 crore
 ke kosh ke saath, jo philhal aalu-pyaaj kii mahangaai se aage soch nahin paa rahaa he
 After coming to power, the new government had issued a decree to the states to abolish the Mandi Act, which was not implemented even by the BJP ruled states
 vyapaariyon kii naaraazgi koun mol le?mahangaai sar par tangi ho or maang kam ho to keemton kii aag main taxon kaa petrol nahin chhidaka janaa chahie
 But the government's second budget was equipped with new whips of excise and service tax
 kaccha tel 100 dollar paar nahin gaya he lekin bharat main petro utpaada mahangaai se phir jalane lage hai to iske liye bajet jimmedaar he, jisane petro utpaadon par nae tex thope die
 By the time the government leaves the celebration of one year and starts thinking of the next year, the increase in the rate of service tax by two per cent would have given new impetus to inflation
 rabi kii fasal kaa nuksaan khaadya utpaadon kii keemton main fatne laga he
 If Monsoon betrayed Modi next year, he would be facing exactly the same questions he was asking the Congress during the campaign
 naare haalanki ghis kar asar chhod dete hai, phir bhi achche din laane kaa vaada bharat ke taaja itihaas main sabase bada rajnatik bayaan tha, madhya varg par jiskaa abhootpurv manovaigyanik prabhaav hua
 Modi is the leader of this middle class, whose discussion is not complete without worrying about employment and inflation, because only ten percent of the people of the country are permanent salaried people and common people spend 45 to 60 percent of their earnings only on food
 Huh
 sarkaar jab apana pehla saal puraa kar rahi he to khapat das saal ke nunatam str par he, rojgaron main badhottaree shunya he or mahangaai waapas laut rahi he
 The real assessment of the Modi government is starting now, the first year was only for preparations
 bharat-america ke bich devayani khobragade maamle ko lekar paidaa hue tanaav ke baad ab bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi kaa udai donon deshon ke bich apekshaakrit adhik tanaav paidaa kar saktaa he
 Times magazine said this in its January 27 issue

 ' croule kehete hai ki america videsh vibhaag ne 2005 main america kanoon ke tahat modi ko vija dene se manaa kar diya tha
 He has said, 'this ban was irrelevant when Modi was in a national level role
 lekin kya america bharat ke shasnadhyaksh ko kaali suchi main daal saktaa he?' He says that US policymakers are divided on this issue
 unhone kaha, 'america congress main pesh kiye gaye prastaav main videsh vibhaag se modi ke pravesh par roak ko barkaraar rakhane kii maang kii gai thi
 ' croule likhte hai, 'yathartwaadee or america vyavsaayee modi ke videshi nivesh par khule ravaiye kaa laabh uthaanaa chaahate hai, or unka kahana he ki unke charitra ko bharat ke saath america ke vyapak sambandhon ke liye utana mahatvapurn nahin mana janaa chahie
 ' vah kehete hai, 'modi ke jeetne par, obama prashasan par desh va desh ke baahar tamaam log dabaav banaaenge ki unke ateet kii ninda kii jaae or unke america par roak lagaai jaae
 But President Barack Obama will have to adopt a different principle in the national interest
 ' Crowley said, "over the years, the United States has built relations with hate leaders from less friendly countries than India
 modi ko vija na dekar america sarkaar ne modi va gujarat hinsa par apana rukh spasht kar diya he
 ' iske saath hi vah kehete hai ki donon deshon ke liye yah jaruri he ki vah modi ke ateet kii vajah se peeche na jaaen

 CBI ne report de di
 The Supreme Court rebuked, but the bjp's heart is still inhabited by rape accused Kuldeep Singh Sengar
 bhaajapa ke bade netaaon kaa photo bhi unke saath he, kya unase koi tippanee aegi? # enoughisenoughhttps: / / t
 co / putvaarihb Let us know that even though MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, accused of rape, has been expelled from the Bharatiya Janata Party a few days ago, he was found with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an advertisement given on Independence Day by a party leader
 unnav ke ek pramukh akhbaar main ungu nagar panchayat ke adhyaksh anuj kumaar dikshit ne swantatrata diwas par ek vigyaapan diya tha
 The advertisement has pictures of Kuldeep Singh Sengar and his wife and Zilla Panchayat President Sangeeta Singh Sengar
 senger bangaramau vidhansabha seat se vidhayak hai or ungu unke vidhansabha kshetra main hi aata he
 It is said that Sanger was instrumental in bringing Dixit to BJP

 The BJP, however, kept itself apart from the controversy
 party pravaktaa shalab mani treepathi ne lakhanu main pitiai-bhashaa ko bataaya ‘‘senger kii tasviir vigyaapan main dena kisi kii nijee pasand ho sakati he
 The party and the government have nothing to do with this
 '' unhone kaha ‘‘party or sarkaar ko jo karnaa tha, vah kar kiya ja chukaa he
 We have no sympathy with Sanger
 ''senger par 2017 main ek naaballig ladki se apane unnav sthit awaas par balaatkaar karne kaa aarope he
 The victim was then 17 years old
 senger ko kuch hi din pehle bhaajapa se nishkasit kar diya gaya tha
 In April last year, the victim tried to commit self-immolation outside Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's residence

 paatra ne kaha ki nehru ne pradhanmantri banane ke liye desh kaa bantwaaraa hone diya to vahiin indira gandhi ne desh main immergency lagu kii
 Sambit Patra said that everyone remembers Rajiv Gandhi's statement about 84 riots
 unhone kaha ki congress party ne desh main satta paane ke liye 3000 sikhon kii hatya karvaa di
 Sambit said that the Congress party does not have faith in the Supreme Court, PMO, Army, Election Commission, Aadhar Card, RBI, President
 unhone kaha ki congress kahati he ki unhone IIM, IIT or samvidhan diya, kyon naa congress chand, taron, ped or suraj par bhi is prakaar ke daawey karne lahati he
 Patra said that Aarahul Gandhi said that he gave the constitution to the country, it is an insult to Baba Saheb Ambedkar
 unhone kaha ki jo vyakti khud 15 pankti nahin likh saktaa wo aaj kah rahaa he ki 15 minute bolne nahin diya ja rahaa he
 The person who cannot speak a minute without looking at the mobile, what will he say for 15 minutes
 bijepi pravaktaa ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ek asafal netaa hai, isliye ve is prakaar ke mudde uthaa rahe hai
 This is not the Save the Constitution, save Rahul campaign
 unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi kaa ye gussa isliye tha kyonki kahin na kahin aaj parivaarwaad maat kha rahaa he or saadhaaran janata satta tak pahunch rahi he

 The Australian Players Association (ACA) said today that the players would boycott Australia 'A' tour of South Africa until a new payment agreement is agreed
 khilaadiyon ke sangh ne sidney main ek apaat baithak kii jisamen unhone 12 july se shuru hone vaale daure ke liye kadam uthaane kaa faisla kiya ki jab tak shuukravaar tak ek nae samjhauta patr (emoyu) par hastakshar nahin ho jate tab tak khilaadi is daure ke bare main nirnay nahin karenge
 ACA Chief Executive Alastair Nicholson said that a decision needs to be made to continue touring South Africa
 unhone patrakaron se kaha, 've aisa kadam nahin uthaanaa chaahate, lekin shuukravaar tak faisla hone tak ve desh se ravaanaa nahin hona chaahate
 So the players are going to the camp as per the plan and we are hoping that we will make some progress in terms of the agreement
 rajasav saajha model ke ahm mudde par mahatvapurn faisla hona jaruri he
 In response, the CA said that they would not force any player to play for the Australian team
 tippaniyan "this is a development tour for Australia 'A' which provides a chance for players to perform at a high level," the CA said in a statement
 isaliye yah hairaani bharaa he ki khilaadi daure par nahin janaa chaahate
 However CA has never forced anyone to play on behalf of the Australian team, who do not want to play nor will they ever do so
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) asie ke mukhya kaaryakari elistare nicholson ne kaha ki dakshin africa daura jari rakhane ke liye ek faisla hone kii jarurat he
 "they do not want to take such a step, but they do not want to leave the country till Friday," he told reporters
 isaliye khilaadi yojana ke anusaar shivi main ja rahe hai or ham ummid kar rahe hai ki ham samjhaute patr ke sambandh main kuch pragati karenge
 An important decision needs to be made on the important issue of revenue sharing model
 ' sie ne iske jawaab main kaha ki ve kisi bhi khilaadi ko australian team kii ore se khilne ke liye baadhya nahin karenge
 The comments sie ne bayaan main kaha, 'australia 'e' ke liye yah ek vikaas daura he jo khilaadiyon ko ucch str par pradarshan karne kaa mauka muhaiyaa karaata he
 Therefore it is surprising that players do not want to go on tour
 haalanki sie ne kabhi bhi kisi ko bhi australian team kii ore se khilne ke liye baadhya nahin kiya he jo khelnaa nahin chaahate or na hi kabhi aisa karegaa

 ) Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, taking the message of the flood of Bihar
 pradhanmantri ke awaas 7 aarasiar par nitish kumaar or narendra modi ke bich kareeb aadha ghante tak baadh ko lekar baatcheet hui
 Apart from the talks, Nitish Kumar also gave a letter to the Prime Minister, in which he again requested Bihar to form a national silt management policy for the Ganga's avidity, along with appropriate central assistance to deal with floods and drought
 patr main likhaa gaya he ki ek taraf bihar ke 28 jile baadh se prabhavit hai to duusari taraf ausat se 14 pratishat kam varsha ke kaaran sukhaad ke halaat bhi he
 Nitish sought help for Bihar During the meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Nitish Kumar once again demanded to send a team of experts to take stock of the situation in Bihar
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne piem modi se baatcheet main kaha ki bihar ke 12 jile baadh sa buree tarah prabhavit hai, ganga or son nadi khatre ke nishaan se upar bah rahi he
 Nitish Kumar has demanded from PM Modi that Bihar be given adequate central assistance to face the current flood and drought situation
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki isse ganga kii aviralata main avrodh, apratyaashit gaad kaa jamaav or vartmaan paristhiti main farkka bairaj ke achitya kaa aankalan kiya ja sakegaa
 In a letter written to the Prime Minister, many districts of Bihar in the grip of drought, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Bihar is a multi-disaster prone state, which is why Bihar has to face some kind of rough and tumble every year due to which the resources are severely damaged
 
 unhone patr main zikr kiya he ki nepal ke tarai kshetron main hui baari barish se bihar ke kai nadiyon ke jal str main kaaphi vruddhi ho gayi thi, jis kaaran uttar bihar ke 14 jilon main baadh kii sthiti utpann ho gayi thi, jisamen 5
 Crops planted on 10 lakh hectares were destroyed
 16760 ghar dhwast ho gaye or 95 logon kii maut ho gai
 In the letter to PM Modi on flooding in Bihar on release of water from Farakka barrage, Nitish Kumar has told the Farakka barrage the reason for increased water level of Ganga
 unhone kaha kifrakka bairajake nirmaan ke kaaran hi ganga nadi main gaad kaa kaaphi jamaav ho gaya he
 Due to silt, the water flow potential of the Ganges has declined
 unhone kaha ki ganga main gaad ke jamaa hone ko lekar kai baar kendra kaa dhyaan is ore aakrisht kiya gaya he or iske samaadhaan ke liye rashtriya gaad prabandhan niti banane kaa bhi anurodh kiya ja chukaa he
 But so far no decision has been taken by the Center, due to which Bihar is constantly facing the problem of floods and the life of Bihar is being affected by it
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne likhaa he ki jabatak rashtriya gaad prabandhan niti gathit kar uskaa karyanvayan nahin hoga, tab tak bihar nepal or padosi rajyon main hone vaali barish se ganga main baadh kaa khatra jhelane ko vivash hota rahegaa
 Nitish Kumar has further written that along with the cleanness of the Ganges, there is a need to have a consolidated perspective on its avidity

 "in fact, Kumar Vishwas released a 13-minute video message, referring to the suicide of the soldiers in Srinagar, the suicide of the farmers, and asked the question to PM Narendra Modi as well as Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal that" If you name corruption Pay will form the government and then only your people will do corruption, but if you save them silently, people will ask questions
 "bhrashtachar par maun rahane ke sawaal par sisodiya ne kaha ki "jab koi concreet jaankaree aati he to ham apane mantri ko hataane main der nahi karte
 "apart from this, the Aam Aadmi Party is also defending itself by saying that its leader himself is fiercely sharing the video of Kumar Vishwas on social media

 Aam Aadmi Party leader Swati Maliwal is fasting at Rajghat to demand the death penalty for the perpetrators of rape
 unke is muhim ko party kaa puraa samarthan praapt he
 Many prominent people including Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia reached out to support Maliwal at the fast, but AAP leader Ashutosh has taken a different stand
 AAP netaa ashutosh ne balaatkaariyon kii maut kii sazaa kaa virodh kiya he
 He said to 'aaj Tak', there should be no right to kill in any civilized society
 hindustan main kanoon ko lekar dikkat nahin he, balki use thik dhang se lagu nahin kiya jaataa he
 i don't support capital punishment
 — ashutosh (@ashutosh83b)april 21, 2018ashutosh ne kaha, nirbhaya ko lekar bada andolan hua, kanoon bana
 But even today innocent girls and women are being raped
 to kya kanoon banane se balaatkaariyon ke man main dar paidaa hua he? unhone kaha ki balaatkaar rokna chaahate hai to hindustan kii vyavastha, nyaaypalika, samaaj kii nazar main jab tak badlaav nahin laaenge tab tak kuch nahin hoga
 Ashutosh said, fast track courts is a good start
 kyonki is desh main kanoon kaa paalan nahin hota or 20 saal tak mukademe latake rahete hai jisase apradhi batch jate hai
 He said that there are Chief Ministers in the country who object to women wearing jeans or people who object to girls wearing skirts, who hold women responsible for rape
 is tarah kii vichaardhaara desh main tezi se punap rahi he, jiskaa virodh nahin hua to balaatkaar yaa atyaachaar kam nahin hoga
 The leader of the Aam Aadmi Party said, in the case of Kathua, the policeman himself is involved in rape
 balaatkaariyon ko maut kii sajaa dene ke mudde par AAP ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal kii raay se alag hone par ashutosh ne kaha ki party kii vichaardhaara alag alag nahin he
 Kejriwal is worried that innocent girls should not be raped
 unhone kaha, dar kaise paidaa hoga? kanoon banane se kya dar paidaa hoga? dar tab paidaa hoga jab agle aadmi ko yah lagegaa ki galat kaam karne par vah salaakhon ke peeche ja saktaa he, lekin is desh main kanoon kaa paalan nahin ho rahaa he
 On the inaction of the police, Ashutosh says that in the case of BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar Unnao, late at night the MLA goes to the ssp's house and says arrest because he knows that the police will not arrest him
 jab aisi vyavastha desh main he jahaan balaatkaar karne vaale khuleam gum rahe hai to faansee kii sajaa kaa kanoon banaaie yaa saream goli maarane kaa plan banaaie, is par koi amal nahin hoga

 The police investigation intensified after heavy pressure in the case of molestation of Varnika Kundu, daughter of an IAS officer in Chandigarh
 is cese ke mukhya aaropee vikaas baraala or uske dost ko saman jari karne ke baad police ne unhen giraftaar kar liya he
 But the biggest question is whether the accused will be punished or will they be released on bail as before
 police ne unhen bhale hi giraftaar kar liya, lekin kya court main aarope sabit ho paaenge
 Action is taken on the basis of evidence and facts in the court and the accused is punished
 varnika cese main police ne shuru se hi jis tarah se laaparvaahee dikhaai he, use dekhakar to lagata he ki aaropee aasaani se batch nikal sakate hai
 The first mistake made by the police is in medical examination
 is dauraan aropiyon ne blad or urine sample dene se inkaar kar diya
 If blood and urine samples had been investigated, new facts would have emerged
 sisitivi footage maamle main bhi laaparvaahee hui
 Let us know the negligence of the police, which weakens the case Medical investigation: Police reached the complaint of Varnika Kundu, arrested the accused Vikas Barala and his friend Ashish and brought them to the police station
 iske baad niyam ke anusaar unka medical jaanch karnaa tha
 The police sent him for medical, where the accused refused to give blood and urine samples
 iske baad doctor ne unhen soongh kar or kuch duusare tareekon se ye pataa kiya ki ve sharaab ke nashe main bhayankar dhut hai
 This has also come to light in the medical examination, but will this investigation be able to stand in the court, this is a big question
 gaiyr-jamaanti dhaaraon ko hatana or jodna:police ne varnika kii shikaayat par pehle vikaas or uske dost ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 354-di, 341, 365, 511 or motor vical act kii dhara 185 ke tahat cese darj kiya tha
 But sections 365 and 511 were removed at 3 in the night
 ise aaj phir jod diya gaya
 Sections 365 and 511 are non-bailable clauses
 ab police ko court main is baat kaa jawaab dena hoga ki baar-baar dharaaen kyon hataai or jodi gayi
 Non-receipt of actual CCTV footage: The most important evidence in this incident could have been to prove CCTV footage, but the police first told that the CCTV cameras in the areas where the victims and the accused's car passed were bad
 haalanki, baad main police ne daawa ki paanch jagahon se unhen footage mil chuke hai
 But neither the recovered footage is clearly visible in the car, nor is its number visible
 aise main court main sabit kar paanaa mushkil hoga ki peechha karne vaali car vikaas baraala kii hi thi
 Pakistan is in a state of disarray after India's historic decision on Jammu and Kashmir and has been taking strange decisions continuously in the last 24 hours
 ab pakistan ne donon deshon ke bich chalane vaali samjhauta express main adnga laga diya or use bich main hi rokte hue kaha ki vah apana driver nahin bhejega
 India hurriedly sent its staff to bring the train
 bhartiya ingine ke saath train ataari stesan par aa chuki he
 Earlier, after Pakistan removed its railway staff, India sent its staff
 phir bhartiya ingine ko train se atech kar diya gaya or sthaneey prashasan se anumati milane ke baad use vahaan se ravaanaa kiya gia
 After this, the train reached Attari railway station around 5:30 pm
 pakistan kii ore se achaanak apni seemaa par samjhauta express chhod die jane se train main savaar yatriyon or un yatriyon ko bhi asar padaa jo train se sawari karte hue pakistan jane vaale the
 After Pakistan left the train in the middle, India decided to send the train and engine to solve this problem
 pakistan kii is harakat ke baad uttar railway ke mutabik samjhauta express ko bagha se ataari laane ke liye railway stoff bheja gaya
 India's response to Pakistan meanwhile, on Thursday afternoon, a statement was issued by CPRO Deepak Kumar of Northern Railway
 unka kahana he ki samjhauta express ko suspend nahin kiya gaya he, train jari rahegi
 Pakistan had expressed some concerns over security and said that it would not send its guard and crew
 north railway ke CPRO ke mutabik, bharat ne pakistan ko bataa diya ki is ore halaat puri tarah se saamaanya he
 So from India, we are sending our engines and guards to the Wagah border which will bring the train from there to Attari
 railway ke anusaar, kul 110 yatriyon ko pakistan se bharat aana he or 70 logon ko yahaan se us taraf janaa he
 In such a situation, India is taking immediate steps for this
 pakistan ne bich main hi train rokane kaa faisla kiya
 Right now all these passengers are boarding this train
 aapako bataa den ki guuruuvaar dopaher ko khabar ai ki pakistan ne samjhauta express roak di he
 But later it was clear that Pakistan will not stop the train, but will not send its guards and crew
 usne apane staff kii suraksha par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 Now the Indian government has decided that the Indian crew who have visas will be sent across
 aapako bataa den ki pakistan suraksha kii chintaa kaa hawala dekar bahaanaa bana rahaa he
 Actually, he is showing his fury about Article 370
 pakistan ko ummid nahin thi ki bharat jammu-kashmir ko lekar is tarah kaa faisla le legaa
 This issue has been going on in the Pakistani Parliament for the last two days, it has also reached the United Nations on this issue

 At the IOA level, we have started working for the bidding process

 When asked about Asaduddin Owaisi's party All India majlis-e-itthadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) contesting the election ground in Seemanchal, Sanjay said that there should be no discussion of 'poison' with 'amrit' as the Shiv Sena is from the country Works to eliminate 'poison'

 Regarding Owaisi's 'entry' in this election and sending Owaisi to spread 'poison' to cut the vote of the secular grand alliance led by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, he said that such betrayal happens in politics when It will be revealed when the election results are out, but Owaisi is a 'poison', if the politics of people like him will grow in this country and society, then the country once again collapses

 At the end of the year, i miss Raymond Carver
 unki kahaniyaan, jinamein 'whot ve tok about, when ve tok about lav' pramukh he, padhate hue mujhe hameshaa hi arth kii phislan kii yaad dilaati rahi hai
 In 2017, the city of India looked like a character in Carver's story
 beete saal ne mujhe hairaan kar diyah saal ke ant main aisa kya he jiske bare main hamane shahar par charchaa ke dauraan baat kii
 This year, the character of urban discussion was stormy, courageous and bashful
 hamaare irdagird navinikaran, vistaar or smart jaise shabdon kii bharmaar rahi
 It filled our expectations to the brim and we started waiting that all of these expectations, or only one of them, would come to fruition at some point
 smart shahar, sabake liye makaan
 Open defecation free cities and towns
 sudhaar yaa behatari kii nahin, balki kayapalat kii baat ho rahi thi
 It was going to be the year of a smart, clean and digital city
 lagata tha, yah to hokar rahegah yah vah saal tha jisaki shuruyaat notebandi se hui thi
 After that, can the possibility of growth be imagined? Twelve months later it has become difficult to find even the least evidence of the beginning of that great metamorphosis
 bengaluru kii jhilein aaj bhi gaaj yaa phen se labalab bhari hui hai, jabaki ek nae master plan ke tahat lagaataar vistaar kii koshishen jari hai
 Like every year, Delhi's hazy winter haze had arrived, but the city has so far not been able to purchase a single bus, control cars, or take any phased steps to control pollution
 mumbai main kayapalat kii manzil se ham kitna dur hai, iskaa saboot us vakt mila jab elfinston road railway stesan ke sankare pul par haadasa hua, jisamen kai logon kii jaan chali gai, or shahar ab bhi us costal road kii kalpana kar rahaa he, jisaki use sakht jarurat he
 The last marshy ground of Ennore Creek in Chennai is still struggling with new aggressively redevelopment plans and the city has to contend with the annual flood problem, with some believing that these two Has an unbroken relationship
 real estate ke bade samoohon main se ek—unitech—pehle ladkadaaya or phir dharashayi ho gaya
 Employment rates stagnated, home loan interest rates fell, yet the poorest segment remained deprived of homes
 lakhanu, kochi or jaipur main nai metro shuru huin or un par rajyon ke bajet kaa baari hissaa kharch hua lekin 10 main se 9 log phir bhi paidal safar kar rahe hai yaa bason yaa anya sadhano kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 The MNREGA (national Rural Employment Guarantee Act) remained rural and so did the National Rural Health Mission — its urban mission is still conceived and residents of the city cannot even experience a social security scheme
 smart, kayapalat or navinikaran—agar namr bhashaa main kahen—mayavi lagata he
 In a way, it was a year to praise the resilience or stamina of our cities against the great plans of planners, policy-makers and metamorphosis contractors
 main puure yakeen ke saath kah saktaa hum ki is maamle main koi choti-si bhi raahat nahin he
 The failure of a grand idea — or at least the delay of work — is also the survival of a simple and common idea, the survival of citizens on cities, the survival of everyday common facilities on big and grand projects, the small changes on an immediate metamorphosis
 Survival of, the survival of ordinary markets on big malls, the survival of autos on the expressway
 jab koi saarvajanik niti ladkadaati he to kisi kii jeet nahin hoti
 Then this incident should be taken as at least one occasion
 is patrika ko padhgaye vaale 'ham' log ke paas ek phir vinamrata ke liye avasar he
 If we accept it then it is no small achievement
 2017 kaa ant bolne se zyada sunne kaa ek mauka he, taaki ham nae shabd khoj saken or puri sachaai or dhairya ke saath samajhane kii koshish kar saken
 Carver and Prem do not ask for anything less
 smartnes ko lekar hamaari itani sari baton par kaarvar puch sakate theru vah kya he, jiske bare main ham baat kar sakate the
 For example, we did not talk about the values of living illegally
 hamaare shaharon main zyaadaatar bhartiya log kahin jagah gherkar or us par makaan banaakar rahete hai
 If we had not taken this place of living as 'slums' and took them seriously as houses, we would have realized that this could have been a good solution to the problem of lack of houses, not an extension of the problem
 yah achal sampatti ke bare main hamaari soch ko badal degaa
 This shows us that Unitech's failure is not a very big event but an unavoidable condition of the real estate market boundaries and that 80 percent of the urban people cannot enter that market
 agar hamane aisa kiya hota to ham houseing ke bare main ek nai paribhaasha paa sakate the—pehle se banaai gai logon kii bastiyon kii suraksha karnaa or use sahyog dena, na ki is baat par sara dhyaan dena ki unitech ke maamle main kya kiya jaae
 This is possible: when Odisha gave 200,000 slum dwellers their land rights in the last months of the year, it became a plan with great silence, which is truly spectacular, and most importantly cleverly called it 'smart
 'name not given
 ham khud ko yaad dilaa sakate hai ki marammat or punarsangyojan ko mahatv dene se 'dhaancha' shabd ke saath hamaara rishta badalane main madad mil sakati he jiske baad hamaari soch keval chamchamati digital dringon, viraan jameenon, bullate trainon, expresve or shishe kii imaaraton tak simit nahin rah jaati
 We could think beyond that
 isaki jagah ham un local train steshnon ke dhime vikaas ke bare main baat kar sakate the jinke pulon kii samay rahete jaanch karke unki marammat kii ja sakati thi, ek aisi houseing colony kii baat kar sakate the jinamein ve bhumigat naale hote, aise bazaar hote jahaan license dekar nae tambu lagaae ja sakate the or unamem dukandaaron kii jagah di ja sakati thi, kaaron kii parkig ke liye jagah banaate hue aise footpath banaae ja sakate the jahaan dukandaar or paidal chalane vaale, donon ke liye jagah hoti
 We could think of our existing service systems — be it health, education, transportation, water or sanitation — to see how they could be linked to each other
 aisa karke ham un sabhi tareekon par vichaar kar sakate the jinase hamaare shaharon main sabhi gharon ko pani—tanker, saajheedaare vaali pipe, saamudayik stand-post, nijee conection, pani kii mukhya line, jugadu conection or 'risaav'-mil saktaa, na ki hamaari badi-badi kagaji yojanaon ke anuroop
 Doing so would mean that even today the solution to our problems is not AMRUT (atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) but smart city
 yah zyada chamak-damak vaali to nahin lekin samasyaon kii jad se judi yojana he
 Make an illegal place of residence, fix it and accumulate land
 yah vah bhashaa he jo spotliten bujhane or udghaatan ke aakhri atithi ke chale jane ke baad bhi kaayam rahati he
 Planners who do not speak of the smartness that presents a picture of metamorphosis rather than reform
 yojanakaar, jo 'ham koun hai' se shuru hote hai, jinaki jaden hamaare shaharon ke ab tak ke nirmaan ke tareeke main nihit hai, jo hamaari apni sadakon ke alaava kahin bhi modelon kii baat nahin karte
 These are planners who know that change requires time and patience
 2018 main hamen vinamrata ke saath apane shaharon ko samajhane kii jarurat he, na ki ahankaar ke saath yah sochane kii ki ham jab chahen apni marji se unka kayapalat kar sakate hai
 Carver tells us that this is the way to understand love rather than just knowing it
 shaharon ke bare main bhi unki yah baat lagu hoti he

 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanathsaf has said that if we tighten the power theft, then the power crisis in the state will go away

 The Sarvada scheme will be run as a campaign from 25 April to 20 June and is specially designed for the domestic consumers
 wo upabhokta jinhone kisi vajah se abhi tak conection nahin liya yaa katiyaa daalkar bijli kii chori kar rahe the, wo ab apni galati ko sudhaar sakate hai
 What is the perpetual campaign? Those who were driving electricity by putting Katia and their house is at a distance of 40 meters
 wo is yojana kaa laabh uthaa sakate hai
 No penalty or action will be taken against those who make these declarations
 upabhokta ko ye bataanaa hoga ki uske ghar me koi bhi bijli kaa bill bakaayaa nahin he
 The declaring consumer has to pay the registration fee
 is ghoshnaa ke teen din ke bheetar hi usko puraa bhugtan karnaa hoga
 Those whose meter connections are disconnected and want to get a new connection, then they can take a new connection by paying the previous dues
 yahaan tak ki agar koi parisar nyaayalay ke adeshon se kabja mukt ho gaya ho or makaan maalik vahaan par nayaa conection lenaa chahta he, par kirayedar kii bijli kaa bill bakaayaa he to vibhaag apni taraf se vasuuli karne kii koshish bhi karegaa basharte aap uski jaankaree vibhaag ko den
 The effort behind this initiative of the government is that the consumers themselves come forward and get Vaidya electricity connection in their homes
 bijli chori to sab karte hangrmi kaa paara chadhate hi uttar pradesh main bijli kaa gambhir sankat mandaraane lagata he
 But the reality is that about one third of the electricity consumed in Uttar Pradesh disappears in power theft

 jab hamane unase poocha ki aap bijli chori kyon kar rahe hai to wo bole ki baar-baar ghar main bijli chali jaati he or koi repere karne ke liye nahin aata he isliye unhone ye katiyaa daali he
 They are assuming that they have made a mistake and now that the government has brought a new scheme, they will rectify their mistake
 masjid main bhi lagi hui he katiamsjid main majalis chal rahi thi isliye vahaan ke care tekar se ham log baatcheet nahin kar paae
 But asked the neighboring neighbor why Katia was installed in the mosque, so people started shouting slogans there

 They run from their electricity mosque to their shop lights
 wo maan rahe hai yo galat he or jo kar rahe hai wo sahi nahin he
 When the team went to take stock in Mousahib Ganj of Thakurganj's Mosahabganj, there are houses which have already been asked to pay a fine of one lakh for power theft
 dm se unako turant bhugtan karne kaa noticebhi aa gaya he
 Despite this, Zahrunisha says that how much power theft will be stopped
 ye unki galati nahin he jab bhi wo maamle ko sulajhane jaati hai to unako ek or pech samajha diya jaataa he
 Actually, this house has a fine of one lakh

 Those people are also using electricity indiscriminately

 The penalty is so high that it has not been repaid and since he was suffering a lot of damage, he has opened shop again

 Dr
 Singh said that there are four important aspects of this problem
 sabase pehle antarrashtriya pahalu judaa he, kyonki pradesh kaa 45 fisadi kshetra or 30 fisadi aabaadi (26 oktober 1947 se) vigat varshon main nikal chuki he
 He also took the name of China along with Pakistan and said that both the countries have seized our territory
 ham inkaar kii mudra main rah sakate hai or har baar pakistan adhikrut kashmir kii baat kar sakate hai, lekin gilgit, baltistan or uttari kshetron, mukhya rup se aksai china or karakoram ke paar ke kshetra se satee shaksgam or yarkand nadi ghati ko chhod diya jaataa he
 Dr
 Singh said that until 1963, the last part was considered to be part of Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir

 Remembering the merger days, Dr
 Karan Singh recalled the days of Jammu and Kashmir's accession to India, saying that when Bapuji (maharaja Hari Singh) signed the merger treaty in Jammu, he had signed only three issues
 
 vilay sandhi ke tahat jammu kashmir ne sirf teen vishyon kaa samarpan kiya tha, jinamein raksha, videsh maamla or bharat ke saath sanchaar tha
 He had taken assurances from India that the people of Jammu and Kashmir would draft their constitution through their Constituent Assembly, whatever happened
 ''maine pandit nehru or shaikh abdulla ke bich dilli samjhaute ke aadhaar par samvidhan sabha bulaai
 The constitution of Jammu and Kashmir was made by the Constituent Assembly of the state and it became law with my signature on 26 January 1957
 yaad kiijie, shaikh abdulla ko pehle hi 1953 main giraftaar kar liya gaya tha
 Both Article 370 and Article 35A came into existence and cannot be changed without the approval of the Jammu and Kashmir Constituent Assembly, which was dissolved at the same time

 Referring to the humanitarian aspect, he said that there are tombs all over the valley

 He said that Kashmiri Pandits have had to flee their homes and many are still residing in camps in Jammu and Udhampur

 In such a situation, the statement of Dr
 Karn Singh, son of Maharaja Hari Singh, the last ruler of Jammu and Kashmir, is considered important

 himachal vidhansabha chunaav kaa bigul baj gaya he or yahaan siyaasi taapmaana kaaphi garm ho gaya he
 If the BJP is in the process of making a comeback to power again, there is a game of cheating in the Congress
 congress pradesh adhyaksh sukhwindar singh sukkhu or siem virbhadra singh ke bich in dinon siyaasi khinchataan jari he
 The Congress on Monday made Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh the head of the party campaign committee in the state
 virbhadra ko pradesh congress pramukh sukhwindar singh sukkhu ko hataakar yah jimmedaari di gai he
 Whereas three days ago, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi made Sukhu the chairman of the campaign committee and Virbhadra as its member
 lekin virbhadra congress alaakaman par dabaav banane main safal rahe or baaji unke haath lagi
 Now in Himachal Congress candidates will be decided not by Sukhu but Virbhadra Singh
 pichley chunaav main virbhadra banaam kaul ke bich shah-matahimachal main 2017 ke vidhansabha kii siyaasi sargharmiyaan chal rahi hai lekin congress kii haalat 2012 jaisi hi najar aa rahi he
 How much time has changed in five years, but Virabhadra has not changed
 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main virbhadra tatkaaleen pradesh adhyaksh kaul singh thakur se bich siyaasi varchasv kii jang chal rahi thi
 Both Kaul and Virbhadra were trying to become the face of the Congress CM at that time
 yahi vajah thi ki virbhadra singh rah-rahakar kaul singh thakur ko kos rahe the
 Not only this, there was also talk of going to NCP
 virbhadra kii bagawati tevar ke aage congress ne kaul singh thakur ko shant kar diya tha
 Veevirbhadra, who had bowed before Congress Virbhadra for power, was made the head of the election campaign committee, the high command also made him the state president after several meetings
 darasal virbhadra ke saare kareebi vidhayak unke saath lamaband ho gaye the
 Governments have been changing in Himachal in turn
 aise main congress kaa number aane vaala tha
 The Congress high command did not want this chance to come to hand
 isliye usne virbhadra ke aage ghutane tech die the
 Virbhadra was also successful in bringing the Congress into the government and then he left the post of Congress State President when he became the Chief Minister
 virbhadra or sukkhu ke bich chhattis kaa aakadavidhansabha chunaav 2012 main jis prakaarvirbhadra singh ne kaul singh thakurse adaavat jagajaahir he, usee tarj par is sukkhu singh se he
 Recently, Virbhadra Singh had written a letter to the Congress high command and said that he would not contest elections if the situation remained the same in the state
 iske baad unke khaas or cabinet mantri prakaash choudhary ne kaha ki vah nahin ladenge to main bhi nahin laduunga or baaki vidhayakon kii bhi yahi raay he
 In fact, Sukhu is considered close to Rahul and from Virbhadra Sonia camp
 lekin himachal kii siyasat ke virbhadra betaj badshaah hai, kai baar rajya ke mukhyamantri rahe hai
 That is why, in view of their displeasure, the Congress has handed Sukhu the side line and handed over the command of the election committee in the state
 congress pradesh adhyaksh sukhwindar singh sukkhu 2017 se zyada 2022 ko dhyaan main rakhkar chal rahe hai
 That is why he is bowed down to Virbhadra at the moment
 paanch fisadi vot se banati bigadati sarkarembta den ki himachal main sarkarein badalane main kuch fisadi vot kii margin se sarkaar palat jaati he
 BJP 43 when it came to power after the 2007 assembly elections
 78 fisadi vot mila tha or congress ko 38
 90 percent
 lekin 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main maamla ulat-palat ho gaya
 bjp's vote share reduced to 38
 47 fisadi rah gaya or congress kaa 42
 81 percent
 isse saaf jaahir he ki saadhe chaar se saadhe 5 fisadi votaron kaa rukh hi tay karata he ki sarkaar kiski banani he
 Paridhan has long been a simple and easy way for leaders to express their political statements
 pradhanmantri narendra modi aadhe baaju vaale kurte main ban-thanakar aate hai to logon ko unamem aise vyakti kii jhalak milti he jo chizon ko behatar parakhane kii kshamta rakhata he

 They said that the youth is being harassed in the name of anti-romeo party, which is not right at all
 congress kii saansad ranjita ranjan ne kaha ki agar upi main bahan-bhai ja rahe hai, to unako rokkar poocha ja rahaa he ki vah koun he? unako pareshaan kiya ja rahaa he
 Boys and girls sitting in the park are being harassed

 lekin 17 disambar ko dilli hycourt kii ore se sajjan kumaar ko paanch sikhon kii hatya kaa doshi qaraar dene ke baad vah masalaa ek baar phir congress kaa peechha karne aa gaya he
 Sajjan Kumar — the first Congress leader convicted, took 34 years to be punished
 2013 main trial court se bari kiye jane ke faisle ko ulatate hue hycourt kii justise es
 a bench of Muralidhar and Vinod Goyal admitted that many criminals had escaped trial and sentence due to political recrimination
 un dangon kii jaanch sahi myanon main 2005 main shuru hui jab justise nanavati ayog kii sifarish par jaanch sibiai ko saunpi gai
 The Congress, the main constituent of the UPA-1 government, initially rejected the Commission's findings against Sajjan Kumar and Jagdish Tytler (the then Union Minister)
 par baari hangaame ke baad manmohan singh sarkaar ko 2005 main jhukna padaa
 The judges mentioned that CBI had to set up 10 commissions and committees to hand over these matters
 hycourt ke 203 pannon ke faisle main usee baat kii pushti kii gai jo varshon se sabhi ko pataa he
 The bench accepted the testimony of Jagdish Kaur, the petitioner, in which she had asked to see Sajjan Kumar (who was then an MP from outer Delhi) inciting the rioters
 cor ne unhen yah kehete suna, ''sikh saalaa ek nahin bachanaa chahie

 Those riots killed 2,733 in Delhi and 3,350 Sikhs in other states
 hycourt ne yah bhi kaha ki isi tarah ke jansanhaar 1993 main mumbai, 2002 main gujarat, 2008 main kandhamal or 2013 main mujffarnagar main hue the, maanavtaa ke khilaaf aise aparaadh rokane ko nae kanoon kii jarurat he

 The Jharkhand Assembly election could prove to be an important barometer of the bjp's electoral performance in view of the ever-increasing prices of onions, along with a narrowing of 5 per cent
 endie pichley 11 maheenon main chaar rajyon main—madhya pradesh, rajasthan, chhattisgarh or maharashtra—satta gavaan chukaa he
 In the first phase on November 30, 13 of the 81 seats in the state have been voted
 23 disambar ko nattejey aane se pehle 20 disambar tak chaar charnon kaa matdaan abhi baaki he
 It is believed that local issues are more effective than national issues in assembly elections and people vote differently
 phir bhi bhaajapa 'modi ke karishme' par bharosa karti aa rahi he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah have already campaigned in the state
 party ko manovaigyanik rup se ek baat kaa phayda he—jharkhand main ab tak jitne chunaav hue hai, unamem har baar bhaajapa akeli sabase badi party banakar ubhari he
 Raghubar Das — the first chief minister to complete a five-year term in the state — has maintained a good reputation with development work
 isi vajah se may main hue loksabhaa chunaav main rajya main bhaajapa ke netritv vaale endie ko 12 siton par jeet mili thi or bhaajapa ko akele hi 51 fisad vot mili the
 Not only this, though in the 2014 assembly elections, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, Jharkhand Vikas Morcha and Congress got 44 percent votes against the nearly 35 percent that the bjp-all Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU) party alliance got, but these three parties a total of 33 seats were won
 iske ulat endie ko 42 siten mili thim jisamen bhaajapa ko 37 or ajasu ko 5 siten mili thim
 Thus the NDA got a simple majority in the 82-member assembly
 lekin vipaksh kaa kahana he ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi rajya main bhaajapa ko achche nattejey mili the phir bhi usee saal hue vidhansabha chunaav main party ko keval 37 siten hi mil pai thim or in 37 siton main bhi 8 siton par vah 5,000 voton ke bahut maamuli antar se hi jeet pai thi
 In recent years, the party's performance in the by-elections in the state was also very poor
 disambar, 2015 se disambar, 2018 ke bich jin 5 siton ke upachunaavon main bhaajapa ne chunaav ladaa tha, unamem se vah keval ek seat hi jeet pai he jabaki uski sahyogi ajasu jin do siton par chunaav ladi thi, ve donon hi siten haar gai thi
 Apart from this, in this state formed in 2000, BJP is alone in the elections for the first time
 sarkaar main hissedaar rahi ajasu, jisane bhaajapa ke saath milakar loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladaa tha, is baar endie se alag ho gai he
 The party led by Sudesh Mahato has fielded candidates for 53 seats
 agar saamaanya rup se pichhadi jati ke votaron or mukhya rup se mahato birdari ke votaron ko apni taraf khinchne kii uski ranneeti safal rahati he to isse bhaajapa ko hi nuksaan hoga
 On the other hand, for Das, his cabinet colleague Saryu Rai will be a different challenge
 bhaajapa se tikat kaate jane ke baad das kii jamshedpur east seat se chunaav lard rahe raay ko haraana aasaan nahin hoga, haalanki das apane kariyar main kabhi chunaav nahin haare hai, 2014 main ve 70,000 maton se vijayi rahe the
 Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi is actively campaigning in the state and promising welfare schemes for the farmers
 congress is baar jhamumo ke netritv vaale gathbandhan kaa hissaa he, jisane hemanth sorain ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaaya he
 26 of the tribal votes in the Mahagathbandhan state
 3 fisad hissaa khinchne kii ummid kar rahaa he
 28 of the 82 seats in the state are reserved for tribals
 congress, jhamumo or jharkhand vikaas morcha ke pradesh adhyaksh adivasee hai
 However, it is comforting for the BJP that in the 2014 elections it won 11 seats out of 28 seats reserved for tribals, which was equal to JMM
 munda adivasee paaramparik rup se bhaajapa ke paksh main apana vot dete rahe hai
 Apart from this, BJP is hoping to garner non-yadav, non-muslim and non-tribal votes among the important backward castes in terms of numbers
 bhaajapa, das ko pichhadi jati ke netaa ke taur par pesh karnaa chaahati he kyonki ve taili jati ke hai or rajya ke pehle gaiyr-adivasee mukhyamantri hai
 BJP has not closed its doors for AJSU
 party ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''hamaara bhagya ajasu ke pradarshan se judaa hua he
 Every vote they get will be in our account only
 '' masalan, party ne ajasu ke pramukh mahato ke khilaaf silli vidhansabha seat se apane ummidavaar ke naam kii ghoshnaa nahin kii he
 Experts believe that it will be easier to establish a rapport between the two if necessary after the election results are out
 is bich jhavimo ke pramukh babulal marandi ise trikoniya muqabla banane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Jhavimo is hoping to win around 20 seats by standing for his candidates in all 81 seats
 marandi trishanku vidhansabha main kingmekar kii bhoomika adaa karne kii ummid kar rahe hai
 They were not ready to accept Soren's leadership
 jhamumo or jhavimo kaa vot bank ek hi he—saamaanya rup se adivasee or vishesh rup se santal
 According to sources, Marandi feared that accepting Hemant's leadership might shorten his stature and lose his vote
 mana jaataa he ki jhamumo-congress-rajd gathbandhan main marandi ke liye keval 10 siten thim jo ek aise vyakti ke liye asweekaarya tha jo kabhi 28 maheene tak rajya kaa mukhyamantri rah chukaa ho

 Earlier this month, Swiss food company Nestle had to withdraw from its 30,000-tonne instant noodle market
 megi main MSG or sise kii maatra taysima se adhik pai gai saath hi miss labling kaa maamla bhi saamne aayaa, jise sehat ke liye nuksaandaayak bataate hue sabaki megi bazaar se gaayab kar di gai
 All companies taking precautions, in this regard, Hindustan Unilever has stopped production of the existing instant noodle goods in the market in view of the approval of FSSAI

 rajgad kaa marble jone sariska vanyajeev abhayaarany se sata hua he or sangrakshit aravali parvatamala kaa hissaa he
 In this context, under the EIA Notification-2006 here, it is necessary to determine the ecosensitive zone and get environmental clearance for mining under it, while the mine owners are mining without this approval

 Under the Minor and Major Mineral Concession Rule 'deemed to Renew', the officials of the mining department were conducting them
 iske tahat jo khan lij avadhi puri kar chuki he, use bina navinikaran karaae navinikrut maan liya gaya
 This is in violation of the Supreme Court order and the Aravali Notification of the Ministry of Environment, 1992
 rajya sarkaar ne bhi 19 june, 2012 ko un khaanon ko raseed jari karne par roak laga di thi, jinke patton kaa navinikaran nahin hua tha
 But the authorities issued a receipt on 5 July 2014 to such mine operators
 in khaanon main rajya ke purv mantri braj kishor sharma kii do khaane bhi hai, jo unki patni ke naam hai
 Clearly, illegal mining takes place due to government collusion

 Indira Gandhi, who was ousted from power at the hands of the Janata Party just a few months ago, sniffed her luck in the incident when Bhumihars allegedly killed nine Dalits in Bihar's Belchhi village in 1977
 chaar saal baad hui apni vaapasi kii patakatha kaa pehla adhyay unhone belchhi ke apratyaashit or asaamaanya daure se hi likhaa tha
 In the last stop of that journey, she reached there by climbing on the elephant and had made headlines at the national level

 Bihar was the only exception where the Congress emerged as the third largest party as part of the winning coalition
 is dauraan belchhi jaise kai maukey aae or chale bhi gaye—dadri main ek shaks ke maare jane se lekar hyderabad main rohit vemula kii khudakushi or jeenyu chaatrasangh ke adhyaksh kanhaiya kumaar kii giraftaar tak, har maukey par rahul gandhi ne apni maujuudagi darj karai
 But it did not affect the health of the party
 congress ke santhnik dhaanche ko durust karne ke liye unhone na to koi koshish kii he or na hi iskaa koi sanket najar aa rahaa he
 He seems to have forgotten what he said after the party's debacle in Delhi in December 2013, "I am willing to do everything i can to rejuvenate the party's organization
" main yah sunishchit karuunga ki badlaav ho or main un tareekon se aisa karke dikhaaungaa jinaki aap kalpana bhi nahin kar sakate
 To bring this "unimaginable change", Rahul Gandhi met with 400 party workers from September to December 2014 and prepared a roadmap to restore the party
 yah khaakaa farvari 2015 main party kii adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko bheja gaya
 This includes ensuring the presence of the party in every district, empowering the grassroots committees and incorporating their opinion in terms of candidate selection in elections, changing the leadership that does not perform well in the states, launching membership campaigns to attract youth And to free the Congress from the image of an anti-hindu and minority friendly party
 ek saal se yah yojana thande baste main padi hui he
 Congress workers have been demanding for a long time that the All India Congress Committee (AICC) be reshuffled so that those leaders get an opportunity to be able to connect with the youth of the country
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav kii sharmindagi ke baavjood ab tak is bare main kuch bhi nahin kaha gaya he
 Lok Sabha MP Shashi Tharoor says, "the Congress needs to revive itself, bring fresh faces and give young blood a place in leadership at every level — at the village, block, district, state and national levels
" desh ke yuvaaon ko yah ehsaas karana padegaa ki ham unki mahatvakankshaon ko samajhate hai or sarkaar main laane ke liye ham par bharosa kiya ja saktaa he
 However, former Union Minister Salman Khurshid has a second opinion on the reshuffle in the AICC
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘eisisi main anubhav or yuva ichhashakti kaa sammishran hona chahie
 We have to understand that there are many types of work in the party
 kuch logon ko vichaar karnaa hota he jabaki baaki log in vichaaron ko maidan main utaarne kaa kaam karte hai
 "there is a latitude going on at AICC headquarters nowadays that when Rahul spoke of" unimaginable change ", he was probably referring to the party disappearing from the national scene
 upie ke ek purv mantri kehete hai, ‘‘rahul kaa samaybodh bahut bhayaavah he
 He waited a long time to address the crisis of Arunachal and Punjab
 punjab main aam aadmi party ne ghuskar apni jagah bana lee, jabaki rahul bhitari matbhedon se ankhen munde rahe or jab unhone aakhirkaar amarinder singh ko party kaa pradesh adhyaksh banane kaa faisla kiya, tab tak kaaphi der ho chuki thi
 According to him, the party has lost its chance of returning to power in Punjab and its chances of achieving a respectable position in Uttar Pradesh have slipped
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘hamane in donon rajyon ke liye prashanth kishor ko apane saath liya tha par punjab main amarinder unase jhagad rahe hai to uttar pradesh main ham unke sujhaavon ke hisaab se koi faisla nahin le rahe

 congress kii bahaali ke liye buniyadi surgery karne par rahul gandhi ne ab tak koi pratikriya nahin di he, par party ke kuch netaa alag-alag bayaan de rahe hai
 He says the operation theater will now have to be moved to the states
 loksabhaa main congress ke mukhya sachetak jyotiraditya sindhiya kehete hai, ‘‘desh main chunavi jang jeetne ke tareekon main buniyadi badlaav aa chukaa he
 For a national presence, the party will have to stand up strong and giving results in the states

 "kamal Nath, a senior colleague of Sindhia and Lok Sabha MP from Madhya Pradesh, repeats his point

 Says Nath, "he is young and energetic and also a jannetta

 "many senior Congress leaders claim that Scindia has never shown interest in going back to the state and wants a national role for herself
" india today ne unase is bare main poocha, to unhone kaha, ‘‘maine party main kabhi bhi koi aadhikarik pad nahin chaha he or na hi chaahunga, par hakeekat yah he ki mujhase rajya kaa prabhaar lene ko kabhi nahin kaha gaya
 "scindia's tumultuous situation is enough to tell what sickness the Congress is and how the party is about to deviate from its restoration path
" agle loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle chaar ahm rajyon—rajasthan, gujarat, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh—main vidhansabha chunaav hone vaale hai

 The ghost of the Vyapam scam in Madhya Pradesh is still hovering over the head of Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 congress ke ek mahasachiv kehete hai, ‘‘in rajyon main hamen kul milakar ek prerak netritv ko tainaat karnaa he or chaaron main jeet kii asal sambhaavnaaen hamaare saath hai
 The anti-incumbency in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh will play an important role as it has been 15 years since the BJP has ruled here

 As there has been a ruckus in the Congress after every election defeat, there is a ruckus to once again make Rahul Gandhi the president of the party
 kuch log rahul kii jagah unki bahan priyanka gandhi ko laane kii bhi maang kar rahe hai
 Whether or not Congress has the ability to launch a blistering plan for its restoration, as Shashi Tharoor says, "change is also necessary to show the public that two consecutive elections of electoral defeat Years later, the status quo in the Congress is not maintained

 But now for whatever government will come to the Center, rising inflation can again pose a challenge
 haalanki iske baavjood yah rigerv bank ke liye suvidhajanak str 4 fisadi se kam he
 Due to rising inflation, people were upset due to very high inflation figures in the era of UPA government and due to this, the atmosphere was created against the government
 lekin is baar ke aam chunaav main mahangaai koi masalaa hi nahin he
 Let me tell you, inflation has remained at a comfortable level for the Reserve Bank for 9 consecutive months
 rigerv bank farvari or april maheene main do baar byaaj daron main katautee kar chukaa he
 While the inflation rate in March 2

 aage bhi mahangaai dar badhane kii ashankayehi nahin, aane vaale maheenon main mahangaai dar or badhane kii ashanka jataai ja rahi he
 Because the prices of crude oil are increasing in the international market and it is believed that in view of the government elections, the prices of petrol and diesel are not increasing in the country, that is, they may increase their prices after the elections

 Among the planets, Shanidev is considered to be the planet that gives results of actions
 shanidev ekmaatr aise dev hai jinaki puja log dar kii vajah se karte hai
 But it is not like that Shani Dev is the God of justice who gives man according to his karma
 akasar dekha gaya he kishanivaar ke din shanidevper tel chadhaaya jaataa he or sarson ke tel kaa hi deepak bhi jalaayaa jaataa he
 What is the relationship between oil and saturn? Why is it that oil is offered to Shani Dev? There are two mythological stories behind offering oil to Shani Dev
 aaie jaane shanidev ko tel chadhaane kaa kaaran or isaki katha
 
 
 The first story is related that this legend is quite popular for offering oil to Ravanashnidev
 mana jaataa he ki ravan apane ahankaar main chur tha or usne apane bal se sabhi grahon ko bandi bana liya tha
 He also hanged Shani Dev in captivity
 usee samay hanumanji prabhu ram ke doot banakar lanka gaye hue the
 Ravana came in arrogance and set Hanumaji's tail on fire
 isi baat se krodhit hokar hanumanji ne puri lanka jala di thi lanka jal gai or saare grah aaazaad ho gaye lekin ulta lataka hone ke kaaran shani ke sharir main bhayankar pidaa ho rahi thi or vah dard se karaah rahe the
 To calm the pain of Shani, Hanumanji massaged his body with oil and freed Shani from pain
 usee samay shani ne kaha tha ki jo bhi vyakti shraddha bhakthi se mujh par tel chadhayega use sari samasyaon se mukti milegi
 Since then, the tradition of offering oil to Shani Dev started
 duusari katha ke anusaar shanidev or hanumanji main hua tha yudhdusri katha ke anusaar ek baar shani dev ko apane bal or parakram par ghamand ho gaya tha
 But in that period, the glory and glory of Lord Hanuman was spread in all four directions
 jab shani dev ko bhagwaan hanuman ke bare main pataa chalaa to vah bhagwaan hanuman se yuddh karne ke liye nikal pade
 When Lord Shani approached Hanumanji, he saw that Lord Hanuman is sitting in a quiet place in devotion to his lord Shri Ram
 shanidev ne unhen dekhte hi yuddh ke liye lalakaara
 When Lord Hanuman Nationdev's defiance of war, he came to explain to Shani Dev
 lekin shanidev ne ek baat na maani or yuddh ke liye ad gaye
 This was followed by a fierce battle between Lord Hanuman and Shanidev
 yuddh main shanidev bhagwaan hanuman se buree tarah harkar ghayal ho gaye, jiske kaaran unke sharir main pidaa hone lagi
 After this, God gave Shanidev to apply oil, which made all his pain disappear
 isi kaaran shanidev ne kaha ki jo manushya mujhe sachche man se tel chadhayega
 i will take all his pains and fulfill all wishes
 isi kaaran tab se shanidev ko tel chadhaane kii parampara kii shuruyaat hui or shanivaar kaa din shanidev kaa din hota he or is din shanidev par tel chadhaane se jald aapaki manokamanaayen purna hoti he
 The world's first nudist restaurant is scheduled to close in February this year

 Akshay Kumar did a job a few years ago which Bollywood actors do not usually do
 darasal akshay ko film singh iz king main best actor kaa aword mila tha
 Akshay was also very happy to receive this award although he had dedicated his award to Aamir Khan as he loved Aamir's work in the film Ghazni that year
 saal 2008 main ai film gazani ke saath hi aamir ne bollywood ke kai record tode the or akshay bhi is film ko dekhakar aamir kii prashansa kiye bina nahin rah paae the
 Akshay said in this video that 'I am very happy
 main pichley 18 saalon se is aword ko apane liye chahta tha
 i never thought that this would ever happen to a Chandni Chowk boy
 mujhe khushi he logon ne mujhe itnaa pyaar diya he par main yahaan khadaa hum haathon main apana sapana liye or main sabko ek baat kahana chahta hum
 a few days ago i saw Aamir Khan's film Ghajini and i was stunned to see that film
 iske baad maine landan se mumbai aate vakt apni film singh iz king dekhi
 i started comparing both the films despite not wanting
 tab mujhe ehsaas hua ki mere hisaab se is saal kaa best actor gazani ke liye aamir khan ko hona chahie

 Don't tell my wife 😜A post shared byakshay Kumar (@akshaykumar) onmar 8, 2019 at 9:02 pm PST It is worth mentioning that Aamir had created a stunning body for his film and it was the first Bollywood film to hit 100 crores
 Had crossed akshay ne aage kaha tha 'main wo insaan nahin bananaa chahta jo aamir se uskaa shrey chhine
 i know that this moment will not come again in my life but i cannot leave from here with something that i know is made not for me but for Aamir
 main ummid karata hum ki maine un logon ko niraash nahin kiya he jinhone mujhe vot diya
 i am still here, wishing for your love and hope to win this award again soon
 main dil se aap sabhi kaa shukriya karata hum lekin aamir ye tumhaare liye dost, kyonki tum ise diserv karte ho

 bollywood main apni film ke hero or nirdeshak kii tarifon ke pul baandhne vaali heroinon ko samajhadaar kaha jaataa he
 And Minisha Lamba also showed no less sense
 jab unhen nirdeshak sanjay gadavi ne 'kidanap' main liya, to unki tarifon ke liye unke paas shabd nahin the
 At that time, their relationship was so strong that Minisha gave them a clean chit for 'kidnap' failure
 mana ja rahaa tha ki minisha ke is prem kii asli vajah gadavi ke kidanap ke nirmaan ke dauraan hi unhen apni agali film main cast karne kii baat thi, jise sach maan ve unka stutigaan karne lagi thim
 But when Ghadvi planned the next film, he paraded in front of every big heroine from Priyanka Chopra to Jia Khan for the heroine, but Minisha was nowhere in her list
