 Aggarwal also said that there is no harm to the heart patient by eating linseed oil
 unhone kaha ki alsi kaa tel agar khaane main istemaal hota he to yah dil ke marijon ke liye gunakari sabit ho saktaa he
 Another ICAR agricultural scientist said that traditional linseed oil contains linolenic acid 35-67 per cent, due to which the oil did not last for a long time due to the oxidation process, so its more as edible oil Was not used, but this new genotype species of linseed TL-99 contains less than five percent of the amount of linolenic acid, so it is now used in edible oil Can be in form

 But on March 2, 2014, things suddenly changed
 darasal hua yun ki ammaa (dow
 Ujjwala Sharma) came to know that Tiwari ji (narayan Dutt Tiwari) is admitted to AIIMS Hospital in Delhi for treatment
 ve jaanati thim ki unke paas janaa thik nahin he, beijjati bhi ho sakati he, lekin ve dil se majaboor hokar vahaan chali gayi
 When AIIMS arrived, it came to know that Tiwari ji has been discharged, but on two dates, he will stay in the Uttar Pradesh House
 buudhe shaks ko ek baar phir se dekhne kii hasarat liye ve sadan pahunchin to tiwari ji kaa kafila nikal rahaa tha
 Both got their eyesight
 tiwariji ne bade sammaan se unhen andar chalakar baithne ko kaha or bole ki ve ek meeting nibata kar aate hai
 Amma went in and sat down and was adjusting herself according to the situation that Tiwari came back
 ve meeting main gaye hi nahin or raste se hi laut aae
 What had not happened for years happened that day and both of them had moistened eyes
 tiwari ji ne lagaav se poocha, “rohit kaisaa he?” ammaa ne kaha, uski tabiyat thik nahin he
 Tiwari ji was filled with heart
 unka sharir saath nahin de rahaa tha lekin ve turant mere paas aane kii jid karne lage
 Amma stopped them and called me
 maine rukhaai se kaha ki aise milane kaa kya phayda, kya ve duniya ke saamne sach ko sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar hai? tiwari ji ne kaha, ve har baat ke liye raji hai
 i am 11
 30 baje raat ko vahaan pahunchaa, saath main electronic media bhi tha
 After years, you have already seen pictures of this family meeting on TV
 lekin camera of hone ke baad ham teenon kaaphi der tak ek saath baithkar rote rahe
 Today my heart has gone sour
 vaise bhi maine adaalat or saarvajanik manchon par tiwari ji kii mukhaalafat jarur kii lekin kabhi aisi ashobhaneey bhashaa kaa istemaal nahin kiya
 Today, i respect my mother as much as i respect my father
 matra devo bhav, pitru devo bhav
 But despite this happy ending, so many years have taught me a lot
 mujhe yaad aata he ki kaise tiwari ji mere har janmdin par ghar aate the
 i never forget the expensive gifts they sent me
 unki yatraaon par chota-sa rohit saath hota tha
 But when Rohit's mother said that give her name to the son, then Tiwari ji's love suddenly began to fade
 jab 1995 main meri moonch kii rekh aa rahi thi, main kishor ho rahaa tha, tab tiwari ji ke daravaaje ham logon ke vaaste hameshaa ke liye band ho gaye
 Mother too put a stone on my heart and let me finish my studies
 vakt kii sui gumti rahi lekin mere jivan kii tis kam na hoti thi
 Then came 2002
 tiwari ji uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri bane
 i too was now 23 years old
 ammaa se kaha ki main apana haq maangane tiwari ji ke paas jaaoongaa
 I, Amma and Nani reached Dehradun
 nani ne tiwari ji se jo kaha vah aaj tak mere kaan main goonjata he, “ham badhai nahin, duhai dene aae hai
 Tiwari ji assured that he will give me the right
 2005 tak yahi silsilaa chalata rahaa
 i used to go to Dehradun
 ve ekant main to laad jataate lekin mujhe tehraate hotel madhuban main
 Many times it happened that i would stay in Dehradun for 15 days and they would stay in Haridwar
 na ve yahaan aate, na mujhe vahaan aane dete
 After every meeting, my faith became stronger that a person who cannot even give me his name should be expected from anything else
 2007 main ham adaalat chale gaye
 i also suffered a heart attack during this legal battle
 ammaa ke liye yah aghat tha
 On the one hand, he had to plead in the case, on the other hand the young son was suffering from serious illness
 tiwari ji in sab baton se beparwaah the
 He was sitting on the high chairs of power and we were rubbing Adiyya on the court frame
 adaalat ne hamen nyaay diya
 The judges who give me justice look nothing short of angels
 lekin kanoonee kaarywahi main maa ke liye istemaal hone vaale ‘badchalan’ or ‘rakhel’ jaise shabd mere dil ko chirate rahe
 Such abuses should be removed at least from the language of law
 maine faisla kiya he ki adalati shabdaawalee se aise aapattijanak shabd hatwane ke liye muhim chalaaungaa
 Apart from this, i remembered Sunny Deol's dialogue 'date on date' on every court date
 aakhir ham itane bade loktantr hai to adaalaton kii sankhya itani kam kyon he? jajon ke paas itane mukademe kyon hai? mukadmaa ladgaye kaa kharch itnaa zyada kyon he? ham nyaayik sudhaar ke bare main kab sochenge?ye sawaal taumr meraa peechha karenge
 But i am satisfied that i gave my mother the honor that every woman should get in the 21st century
 ammaa hameshaa kahati hai, “parampara se haten to samaaj sweekaar kar saktaa he, lekin maanavtaa se haten to samaaj sweekaar nahin karata
 "tiwari ji and mother had deviated from a tradition, so i came into the world, but Tiwari ji had moved away from humanity
 aaj unka dil pigal chukaa he
 They have returned to the path of humanity
 main yah bhi jaanata hum ki unhen bhatakaane ke peeche kuch logon kaa nihit swaarth tha
 But now a ray of light is visible
 main un sab logon kaa abhaari hum, jinhone duniya main apni tarah ke anokhe mukademe main meraa or ammaa kaa saath diya
 i want that no mother should be choking like this and every child like me should give his mother his right

 (devi Shetty is a cardiac surgeon and philanthropist) guuruuvaar yani kal se kathmandu ke liye vayusena ke transport vimaanon ke oparation par roak lag sakati he
 NDTV India has been quoted by sources as saying that the movement of transport aircraft going to Kathmandu from New Delhi and elsewhere will now be stopped
 bahut jaruri hone par hi transport vimaanon ko raahat abhiyaan main kathmandu bheja jayega
 There are many reasons for this
 sabase badi vajah to yah bataayi ja rahi he ki nepal sarkaar or khaas taur par nepali sena is baat se bhi khush nahin he ki bhartiya media main raahat abhiyaanon main keval bharat kii baat hi dikhaai ja rahi he or sara credit bhartiya senaaon ko diya ja rahaa he
 The Nepalese Army is worried about this and the image of other friendly countries besides India, who are helping in the Rahat campaign
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki nepal kii sena ne mangalvaar ko ek bhi bhartiya patrkaar ko helicopter se raahat abhiyaan ke saath udaan bharne nahin di
 It is being told that now whatever plane of the Air Force will go to Nepal with relief material, it will have to give all the details first, for example what goods are coming and what is included in it? This was not done before
 palam airbase se vimaan sidhe kathmandu ke tribhuvan airport ke liye udaan bharte the or unhen koi khaas ditels dene kii jarurat nahin padati thi
 The comments 27 april ko vayusena ke do transport vimaan kathmandu gaye the lekin unhen utarane nahi diya gaya
 At that time, the reason was stated that there is a lot of air traffic in Kathmandu
 phir is masale ko sulajhane ke liye vayusena kaa ek adhikari mangalvaar ko kathmandu pahunchaa tha or maamla sulajh jane kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 But all this does not seem so easy
 buudhvaar ko bhi dopaher tak hindon se keval ek si-130 kathmandu ke liye udaan bhar sakaa wo bhi baby food lekar
 On Tuesday, only two aircraft were able to go
 inamen ek dilli se or ek bathinda se raahat saamagree lekar kathmandu pahunchaa tha
 By the way, the road between India and Nepal has also opened and whatever relief material may now go from India to Nepal can be sent via road
 bahut jaruri hone par hi transport vimaanon ko raahat abhiyaan main kathmandu bheja jayega
 There are many reasons for this
 sabase badi vajah to yah bataayi ja rahi he ki nepal sarkaar or khaas taur par nepali sena is baat se bhi khush nahin he ki bhartiya media main raahat abhiyaanon main keval bharat kii baat hi dikhaai ja rahi he or sara credit bhartiya senaaon ko diya ja rahaa he

 inamen ek dilli se or ek bathinda se raahat saamagree lekar kathmandu pahunchaa tha
 By the way, the road between India and Nepal has also opened and whatever relief material may now go from India to Nepal can be sent via road
 nepali sena ko isse apni tathaa bharat ke alaava un anya mitra deshon kii chhavi kii chintaa sata rahi he jo rahat abhiyaan main madad de rahe hai
 Perhaps this is the reason why the Nepal Army did not let any Indian journalist fly by helicopter with relief operations on Tuesday
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ab raahat saamagree lekar vayusena kaa jo bhi vimaan nepal jayega to use pehle saare ditels dene honge, masalan kya saamaan lekar aa rahaa he or usamen kya-kya shaamil he? isse pehle aisa nahi tha
 From the Palam airbase, the aircraft flew directly to the Trimbhuvan Airport in Kathmandu and did not have to provide any specific details
 tippaniyan On 27 April, two Air Force transport aircraft went to Kathmandu but were not allowed to land
 us samay isaki vajah ye bataai gai ki kathmandu main air trephic bahut zyada he
 Then an Air Force officer reached Kathmandu on Tuesday to resolve the issue and the matter is being claimed to be resolved
 par ye sab itnaa aasaan nahin lag rahaa
 Even on Wednesday, only one C-130 could fly to Kathmandu from Hindon with baby food
 iske pehle mangalvaar ko bhi keval do hi vimaan ja paae
 One of them had reached Kathmandu with relief material from Delhi and one from Bathinda
 vaise ab bharat or nepal ke bich sadak maarg bhi khul gaya he or ho saktaa he jo bhi raahat saamagree ab bharat se nepal jaae vah sadak maarg ke jariye bheji ja sakati he
 It is being told that now whatever plane of the Air Force will go to Nepal with relief material, it will have to give all the details first, for example what goods are coming and what is included in it? This was not done before

 While India's large membership, including the US and Russia, is supporting India's membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), China has tried to stall this path once again
 padosi mulk ne somvaar ko kaha ki sol main hone vaali baithak main bharat kii sadsyta koi mudda hi nahin he
 China said, 'NSG member countries are still unanimous on this issue

 Responding to questions asked about Foreign Secretary s Jaishankar's visit to China from June 16-17 and Sushma's statement, Hua said, "india is on the agenda of the NSG meeting to be held in Seoul from June 24 to 48
" The issue of inclusion in the member group is not included
 ''ham samajhate hai ki bharat phikrmand he'unhone aage kaha, 'ham samajhate hai ki is saal sol main ho rahe vashirk sammelan main aisa koi vishay shaamil nahin he
 We understand that non NPT countries are concerned about their entry into the NSG
 lekin enesji banta hua he or aise main sol main hone ja rahe vashirk sammelan main pravesh ke mudde ke bare main baat karnaa abhi uchit nahin he
 Hua further stated that she wanted to state that the issue of non-npt countries joining the NSG was never included in the NSG agenda
 kya he china kii aapattienesji parmaanu se sambandhit ahm muddon ko dekhtaa he or iske 48 sadasyon ko parmaanu praudyogiki ke vyapaar evam uske niryaat kii ijaajat hoti he
 The NSG operates under the principle of consensus and even a country's vote against India can damage India's claim
 china enesji main bharat kii entry kaa virodh kar rahaa he
 It says that no country can have an entry in this group without signing the Nuclear non-proliferation Treaty (NPT)
 enesji kaa gathan 1974 main india ke pehle parmaanu pareekshan ke baad hua tha
 The aim was to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons worldwide
 India's NSG membership not on Seoul meet agenda: China

 ) In India, there was a lunar eclipse at 6
7 pm on Monday, which ended at 10 pm
 isko ham suvidha kii drushti se grahan jarur kah rahe hai par takneekee drushti se ye grahan kii shrenee main nahin aata
 Therefore, there will be no idea of sutak, bath, perforation etc
 ye maadya chandra grahan he jisamen chandramaa par prithvi kii halki chaaya padati he, is kaaran chandramaa kii safedi par halki malinta aa jaati he parantu chandramaa ko grahan nahin lagata
 Therefore, this lunar eclipse does not give very good or bad effects, it can definitely increase or decrease the effects of solar eclipse
 ye poornamasi ke din kii chaaya grahan isliye bhi mahatvapurn he kyonki atichaari mangal udit ho rahaa he or surya, mangal, budh, brihaspati tathaa raahu ek saath makar raashi main panch grah yoga bana rahe hai
 Moon is doing yoga with Ketu
 is yuti se alag-alag raashiyon ke logon ko saavdhaan rahanaa chahie or kuch vishesh upaay karne chahie
 This event will reduce the ill effects of Taurus, Aquarius, Virgo and Libra and increase the auspicious effects, while Aries Cancer will decrease the auspicious effects of Sagittarius and Leo sign
 mithun, vrishchik, makar tathaa min raashi ke liye ye grahan sam he
 That is, the effects that the transit of Jupiter and Saturn have given or will be due to solar eclipse, it will not improve or spoil them, but will let them remain the same
 par koi bhi raashi ho, sabake liye is chandra grahan kaa laabh buhat bataaya gaya he
 This type of lunar eclipse is very good for thinking
 is prakaar ke grahan main nitiyaan banani chahie
 In such an eclipse, one should worship God and try to get meditation, concentration etc
 vidhyaarthiyon tathaa saadhakon ko to 8 baje se 10 bajkar 10 minute tak isht kii aradhana yaa dhyaan jarur karnaa chahie
 Start by chanting 'oom' or doing whatever mantra you wish to do by laying a white cloth on a blanket or on an outpost, anywhere from east to north or meditating on a flame of fire or on the feet of your God or on your breath
 Focus and walk in your prayers

 photedaar ke mutabik, apni hatya se kuch din pehle hi indira gandhi ne raajnneetik uttaradhikari ke taur par priyanka kaa naam sujhaayaa tha
 She considered him her political heir due to Priyanka's skill and nature
 unhen priyanka main raajnneetik kushalta najar aati thi
 However, Sonia Gandhi is not yet convinced about this
 indira ne kiya tha kashmir dauraindira gandhi ke aakhri dinon kaa zikr karte hue maakhan laal photedaar ne kaha ki oktober 1984 main unhone kashmir kaa daura kiya tha
 During this time she went to Hindu and Muslim religious places
 tabhi unhone is baat kaa zikr kiya tha
 Significantly, on October 30, Fotedar's book 'chinar Leaves' is being launched
 is kitaab main hi photedaar ne gandhi parivaar ko lekar kai bade khulaase kiye hai
 Fotedar said that Indira started discussing Priyanka in a very emotional way and talked about identifying Priyanka as a 'future leader'
 rajeev or sonia donon ko bataai thi khwahishvarishtcongress netaane kaha ki indira kii hatya ke baad unhone rajeev gandhi or sonia gandhi ko bhi is baat se waakif karaayaa tha
 However, both of them never considered it more seriously
 apni kitaab main vah is baat kaa bhikhulasakarenge ki kin paristhitiyon main sonia gandhi ko raajnneeti main aana padaa?bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav ke samay congress main jorshor se maang uthi thi ki priyanka gandhi ko saamne laayaa jaae or party main ohada diya jaae
 However, this demand of the workers has not yet been accepted by the party high command
 inakam tex ritern bharne kii aaj aakhri taarikh he
 This means that now you have only a few hours left to fill your ITR
 agar aapakiinakam taxke daayre main aati he, to aaj aapako kisi bhi sthiti main apana inakam tex ritern file kar lenaa chahie
 If you do not do this, you can be fined from 1 thousand to 5 thousand rupees
 agar aap disambar ke badaitiarbharate hai, to aap par 10 hajaar rupee tak kii penlti lag sakati he
 You have two ways to file income tax return
 aap chahen to online itiar file kar sakate hai
 For this, you have to reach the income tax department's e-filing website
 yahaan aapako apni tex dendaree ke anusaar form chunanaa hoga
 The second way is to fill the ITR offline
 agar aap vetanbhogi hai, to aapako itiar 1 form bharna hoga
 If you are not comfortable about filling online, then you can take help of tax experts
 31 agast yani ajinakam tex riternbharane ke baad yaad rakhiye ki aapako apana itiar veriphai bhi karnaa hota he
 For this you have 120 days
 in 120 dinon ke bheetar aap apane itiar ko aasaani se veriphai kara sakate hai
 For this you can resort to your base OTP
 iske alaava net banking or bank ditels ke aadhaar par bhi aap ye kaam nipta sakate hai
 But the most important thing to keep in mind is that if you did not file the return today and your tax liability is made, then you can be fined
 is penlti se bachane ke liye jaruri he ki aaj kisi bhi haal main apana itiar bhar len
 However, this will not be applicable to the people of Kerala
 kyonkiinakam taxvibhag ne yahaan ke kar daataaon ke liye dedline badhaakar 15 sitambar kar diya he
 In fact, the department took this decision in view of the worsening situation here due to floods
 lagbhag do dashakon se adhik samay 1992 main sanshodhit 1986 kii rashtriya shiksha niti hi shiksha ke kshetra main centre sarkaar kii disha-nirdeshak bani hui he
 Prior to this, the National Education Policy was formulated in 1968, which was the first national initiative in the field of education after independence
 haalanki angreji raaj ke dauraan bhi wardha shiksha yojana (mahatma gandhi kii nai talim) ne 1938 main ek ''rashtriya niti" kaa masauda taiyaar kiya or prantiy sarkaron se us par amal karne kii sifarish kii
 The 1944 report (sargent Plan) on the CAB (CABE) Committee's "plan for the Development of Education in post-war India" on "making Primary Education Accessible to All and Improving the Total Quality of Education" Emphasis was given
 yun to 1986-92 kii shiksha niti vichaar or avadharana ke maamle main kaaphi vyapak he lekin usase shiksha kshetra main makul nattejey nahin nikle hai
 In spite of all kinds of goals and programs, the issue of education in the country is the most poor
 zyaadaatar uddeshy or lakshya aanshik rup se bhi nahin hasil kiye ja sake hai
 The major reason for this is that there is no practical framework nor specific rules and regulations related to operation
 or to or, gaanv / block se hi har str par baari raajnneetikaran ke saath bhrashtachar kaa dayera is had tak bad gaya he ki shiksha kaa koi pahalu isse achoota nahin rah gaya he
 This is the most important story of the last nearly three decades
 loktantr main shiksha or saarvajanik swasthya vikaas ke shaayad do sabase ahm pratik hai
 The reality of the last decades is that even these areas have not been paid any attention
 so, aaj, durbhaagya se, jamini hakeekat usase katai alag he jise is niti kaa uddeshy bataaya gaya tha
 Admissions to both schools and higher education institutions have increased rapidly, but with it many more unsolicited new cases have also increased
 schuli vyavastha main buniyadi suvidhaon main ijapha hua he lekin padhai kii gunvattta main maamuli fark bhi nahin aayaa he
 Not only this, several successive studies show that there has been an alarming decline in the results of schooling
 sarkari skool nunatam gunvattta kii shiksha dene main bhi naakaam rahe hai
 As a result, private or "aided" schools in rural areas have opened up in a big way but these too have not been able to produce any results
 nijee collejon or vishvavidhyalayon kii bhi baadh aa gai he, jinamein zyaadaatar koi khaas fark nahin he or inase milane vaali degree par kai vaazib sawaal uth chuke hai
 Much progress has been made in the matter of availability and admission of education, but now the new concern is increasing about the quality of education
 ''samaveshi" shiksha vyavastha kaa mudda to kahin dur chhot gaya he
 The "gunotsav" run by the National Council of Education Research and Training (NCERT), NGO Pratham (ASER), and the Government of Gujarat have also been involved in assessing the level of education and implementation of policies for the last nearly 15 years
 unke taaja adhyayan behad niraashajanak tasviir pesh karte hai
 For example, according to ASER, 2014, 25 percent of eighth grade children cannot read second-grade lessons, with 13 in 2010 outnumbering such second-grade students in rural schools
 4 pratishat se badhkar 2014 main 32
 5 percent who do not even have knowledge of alphabets
 sarkari skulon main padhai ke str main 2010 se 2012 ke bich teji se giravat ai he
 Half of the children of the fifth grade could not even learn the basics that they should have learned in the second grade
 kareeb 50 pratishat bachche ganit kii buniyadi baaten siikhe bagaiyr aath saal kii schuli padhai puri kar lete hai
 After this, no specific comment is needed to state that our education system is a victim of a grave predicament and there is a need to take concrete steps for improvement immediately
 shiksha kaa adhikaar (artii) kanoon kii vajah se skulon main daakhilon ke saath buniyadi sanrachana par bhi jor badha he, lekin ab nae gambhir mudde ubhar aae hai jinka hal talashna jaruri he
 In particular, the "policy of failure" needs to be rethought
 yah aashwast kiya janaa chahie ki yah vaikalpik ho or samajhadaari ke saath amal kiya jaae
 In the education system, there is no clear policy regarding private sector participation at both the level of school and higher education
 is maamle main alag-alag rajyon main alag-alag tareeke apanaae jane kii gunjaaish to he lekin sarkari or nijee kshetra kii bhoomikaayen spasht nahin hai
 In principle, our system seems to be chanting that education is not acceptable, that the aim of an educational institution should not be to make profit
 lekin saarvajanik jivan ke duusare tamaam kshetron kii hi tarah hakeekat in mantron se bilkul juda he
 The huge growth in higher education institutions in the last two decades has been based on the practice of "capitation fees", which thrive on black money and questionable financial transactions
 yah bhi tathy he ki kai tathakthith ''dharmarth shikshan treston" kaa makasad vishuddh paisa kamanaa hi he or zyaadaatar maamalon main rajnatik birdari ke saath santhganth yaa uski shah se inkaa kaarobaar chalata he
 All these developments remind us of the magnitude of serious and drastic reforms
 academik shodh kii gunvattta, kul daakhile or nattejey donon hi maamalon main ummid se kaaphi kamatar he
 Activism and acceleration in the academic field require new ideas and research
 is kshetra main vishesh dhyaan dene kii jarurat he jo hamaari arthvyavastha main kaaphi yogadan kar saktaa he
 In every ambitious society, the natural desire of parents is that their children get "good education"
 haalanki rojgaar ke kshetra ke liye hunar ke vikaas or uske samakaksh academik maanak sthapit karne kii gambhir aupchaarik koshishen nahin hui hai
 It also means that there are no paths available to proceed with the degree
 gunvatttapurna rojgarparak prashikshanon ko sammanjanak haisiyat dilaane or unako samaaj main sweekaarya banane kaa maahaul taiyaar karne ke liye bhi fouran dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 a big and new aspect is the widespread use of information and communication technology
 soochnaaon ke aadan-pradaan, hunar main ijaphe or kai tarah ke maamalon main ab nai takanic uplabdh he lekin shiksha ke kshetra main abhi tak paryaapt dhang se inkaa upyog nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 There is immense potential for improvement in quality, preparation of teachers, teacher-assisted techniques in the classroom and techniques for coaching
 is disha main gambhirtha se vichaar kiya janaa chahie
 Countless things can be done with "big Data" such as the level of students 'learning, linking performance of students to teachers' performance, checking the progress of individual schools
 beshak, takanic bade paimaane par bharat main pahunchi he par bhartiya sthitiyon ke anuroop use saadhane kii koshish abhi nahin hui he
 Fortunately, the Ministry of Human Resource Development, especially the Minister of Human Resource Development, has taken major steps to revitalize the education sector and intends to announce a new education policy soon
 yah behad swaagatyogy kadam he
 The new initiative is expected to give a new direction to the education sector, prevent a steep decline in standards of education, and pave the way for better quality standards
 shiksha ke str ko ooncha uthaane, har str par rajnatik dakhsandaji ko khatm karne yaa kam se kam karne kii rajnatik ichhashakti hi bharat ko ek hi peedi main vishwa str par pahunchaa sakati he
 So, the stakes of the new policy are high, this will decide whether India will become the world guru in this century

 com / ixdbciqakj — Keh Ke Peheno (@coolfunnytshirt) October 1, 2019 It is worth mentioning that there was a terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team that visited Pakistan about 10 years ago, since then no external team in Pakistan had reached international matches

 The accused escaped by throwing the injured, when the people around saw the incident, the vehicle stopped and put the injured Amritlal in the car to take him to the hospital
 insaaniyat tab sharmasaar ho gai, jab gaadi chaalak ghayal amritlal ko udyaan maarg ke paas ek sunsaan gali main phenkakar faraar ho gaya
 The injured Amritlal was lying there all night

 But the question arises that when life is giving breath, then how can a person turn away from human being at such a time
 agar vakt rahete insaaniyat jinda ho jaati to matibul or amritlal aaj maut ke munh main na samaae hote

 The difference between Rahul, Gujarat and 1984 is that the Gujarat government was involved in the riots
 jab gujarat dange hue modi mukhyamantri the
 The Gujarat government was actually inciting and instigating the riots
 supreme court kii clinit nahin dekhi rahul nejetli ne kaha ki dangon ke liye modi par lagaae gaye sabhi aarope galat sabit ho chuke hai

 After all, the income of milk from animal husbandry is only this much
 unhen har maheene kareeb do lakh rupee kii aamadani ho jaati he
 Every day, 250 liters of milk is stored in dairy
 kharch nikaalkar bhi behad acchhee kamai ho jaati he
 The reason for earning an executive working in cities is not only for cattle rearing to be milch cows, but there is a whole system of dairy cooperatively
 yahaan har gaanv main milk collection centre he, jisase pashupalkon ko gaanv se baahar doodh bechney nahin janaa padataa
 One has to go to the center of the village and collect milk

 a few years ago, Banaskantha was the most backward district of Gujarat
 pani kam tha isliye jindagi aasaan nahin thi

 The reason is to provide every animal related facility free of cost to the cattle rearers
 banaas deyari ke adhyaksh shankar choudhary kahete hai ki sirf doodh jamaakar use bechnaa hi sahakaarita nahin he
 They have provided the facility of a veterinarian free of cost when animals become ill

 Firstly, its cooperative model is being tried in Uttar Pradesh outside Gujarat
 banaas deyari uttar pradesh ke kareeb 10 se zyada jilon main apane model se doodh utpaadan or anya utpaada banaaegi
 Uttar Pradesh is much larger than Gujarat, milk is four times the size of Gujarat but due to lack of arrangements for collection and marketing, cattle rearers are not getting the right price for their milk
 gujarat main aaj prati litre pashupaalak ko kareeb 42 se zyada rupye die jate hai jo ki desh main sabase behatar he
 According to Shankar Chaudhary, at present Banas Dairy is collecting about three lakh liters of milk daily in Uttar Pradesh and the target is to reach 20 lakh liters by 2022

 sambit paatra kii raily or uski tasveeron main saaf chunaav aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan dikhaai de rahaa he
 Patra, however, denied the allegations and said, "during the rally someone gifted me the idol

 There is nothing wrong in showing faith towards God

 After 24 rounds of counting in the Jokihat Assembly by-election, RJD candidate Shahnawaz Alam won with a margin of over 41 thousand votes
 argedy pehali baar yahaan se vijayi hui he
 Shahnawaz defeated his nearest rival Murshid Alam of JDU by a margin of 41,224 votes
 shahanvaj ko 81,240 jabaki murshid ko 40,016 vot mili
 JDU candidate Murshid Alam was leading in the early trends for a while after the counting of votes started at 8 am, but the sixth round count was reversed and after that, RJD candidate, Shahnawaz Almalgatar maintained his lead
 aaj takse khaas baatcheet karte hue argedy ummidavaar shahanvaj alam ne kaha ki nitish kumaar or unki sarkaar ne jokihat main 1 maheene se bhi zyada vakt tak camp kiya or chunaavon ko prabhavit karne kii koshish bhi kii iske baavjood bhi vah apane mansoobey main safal nahin ho saki
 After 4 consecutive victories, Harshanwaj Alam said that Rajya Sabha MP RCP Singh and many ministers of the Bihar government had remained in Jokihat before the elections, but to no avail
 shahanvaj ne kaha ki lakhon rupee kharch karne or prashasnic amale kaa puraa istemaal karne ke baad bhi jediu ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa he
 In Jokihat assembly by-election, jdu's Haritish Kumar is a big blow
 2005 main mukhyamantri banane ke baad se hi nitish kumaar kii party jediu lagaataar chaar baar jokihat vidhansabha chunaav jitati rahi he, lekin is baar use munh kii khaani padi he
 There was a nose question for Nitish, who became the fiercest leader, Jokihat Assembly by-election, but the RJD has blamed all the plans of Nitish
 chunaav se pehle hi jokihat kii ladaai jediu banaam argedy nahin balki nitish kumaar banaam argedy netaa tejasvi yadav ho gai thi
 In the absence of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, Tejashwi Yadav retained the party's front in Jokihat and eventually won
 jokihat main jediu kii chunavi haar se yah baat bhi ab sabit ho gai he ki nitish kumaar kaa pichley saal mahagathbandhan chhodkar bijepi ke saath sarkaar banane kaa faisla muslim matadaataaon ko pasand nahin aayaa he jiskaa khamiyaja party ko 2 maheene pehle arriya loksabhaa upachunaav main bhi dekhne ko mila jahaan jediu ko karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha or argedy ummidavaar sarfaraj alam kii jeet hui thi
 At the same time, the election victory in Jokihat is a big achievement for RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav
 tejasvi ne yah sabit kar diya he ki apane pita kii gairmaujuudagi main bhi unhone pehle haraiya loksabhaa upachunaav party ko jitayaa or ab jokihat vidhansabha upachunaav main bhi party ko jeet dilwaai he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has once again entered the battle of Varanasi
 modi ke khilaaf congress ne ajay raay or sapa ne shalini yadav ko ummidavaar banaaya he
 Even in 2014, Ajay Rai was in front of Congress from Modi, but could not save his bail
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki congress ne kaashi main modi ko puri tarah se walkover de diya he
 However, there are many seats in Purvanchal, where the Congress is seen competing strongly in the electoral arena
 purvanchal main kul 26 loksabhaa or 130 vidhansabha siten hai
 At present, the Congress does not have a single MP
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress purvanchal ilaake se ek seat par hi jeet darj kar saki thi
 While the Congress came to the polls with the SP
 purvanchal congress ke liye ek daur main sabase majboot garh hua karata tha
 Not only this, in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress was able to win 6 parliamentary seats in Purvanchal area
 is loksabhaa chunaav ke ran main utarane se pehle congress ne siyasat main priyanka gandhi kii entry karakar bada masterstroke chalaa tha
 Political speculation was rife that Priyanka Gandhi would contest from Varanasi against PM Modi, but after several days of suspense, Congress announced Ajay Rai's name on Thursday
 congress ne bhale hi varanasi seat se party ke kisi diggaj netaa ko na utaara ho, lekin purvanchal kii kai siton par diggajon ko utaara he
 These include Lok Sabha seats of Kushinagar, Salempur, Mirzapur, Pratapgarh, Bhadohi, Sant Kabir Nagar, Basti and Maharajganj
 purvanchal kii in aathon siton par congress ke diggaj kaaphi majboot maane ja rahe hai
 Former Union Minister and veteran Congress leader RPN Singh is in the fray for Kushinagar seat
 banaras se lagi hui mirzapur seat par upi ke purv mukhyamantri kamalapati treepathi ke parpote laliteshapati treepathi chunaav lard rahe hai
 In the Salempur seat, former Congress MP Rajesh Mishra is giving a tough fight to the BJP and the alliance candidate
 jabaki pratapgarh seat par congress ne purv videsh mantri dinesh singh kii beti or kai baar saansad rah chukin ratna singh ko utarkar sabhi ke sameekaran ko bigaad diya he
 The Congress has fielded Ramakant Yadav, a former MP from Azamgarh on Bhadohi seat
 haalanki bhadohi ramakant ke liye nayaa ilaaka he, iske baavjood wo basapa or bijepi donon ummidavaaron ko kadi takkar den rahe hai
 Bhalchandra Yadav, a former SP MP from Santakbir Nagar seat, has been fielded by the Congress, who seems to be spoiling the political equation of BSP and BJP
 sapa or basapa sarkaar main mantri rah chuke raaj kishor singh ko congress ne basti seat se utaara he
 Apart from this, it has made the contest interesting by removing Supriya Srinet, daughter of Harshvardhan Singh, who has been MP for Maharajganj seat many times
 congress ke varisht netaa shashi tharur ne kaha he ki kaarysmiti sahit party main zyaadaatar padon ke liye chunaav jaruri hai
 He also hoped that the process of election within the party would soon begin under the leadership of Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi
 tharur ne ‘pitiai-bhashaa' ko die saakshaatkaar main kaha, ‘‘maine kai baar kaha he ki congress kaarysmiti samet netritv ke zyaadaatar padon ke liye kaaryakartaaon ke bich chunaav jaruri hai
 His new book, The Hindu Way: An Introduction to Hinduism, is coming soon
 unhone kaha ki party main aantarik chunaav se bhavishya ke netaaon ko safaltaapurvak kaam karne main madad milegi or party ke bheetar nayi urja kaa sanchaar hoga
 Tharoor said, "therefore i hope that the elections will be held soon and i am confident that under Sonia Gandhi, the party will work in this direction
" '' pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bare main jairam ramesh ke bayaan kaa samarthan karne ke sandarbh main puche jane par congress saansad ne kaha ki vah aisa kehane vaale pehle vyakti hai ki modi sarkaar main bahut sari chijen aisi nahin he jinhen sakaaratmak rup main dekha jaae
 He said, "modi has been successful in increasing the vote percentage from 31 to 37 in this election and when the Congress vote percentage is only 19 percent then we will have to make efforts to understand why this happened
" '' Social worker Anna Hazare is preparing to fight against the Modi government
 23 march se dilli ke ramlila maidan main anna hajaare kaa satyagrah shuru hoga
 This time Anna Hazare has demanded concrete steps for the rights of farmers
 kisaanon kii sunishchit aay, pension, kheti ke vikaas ke liye thos nitiyon samet kai maangon ko lekar anna hajaare pradarshan shuru karenge
 All attempts to persuade him before have failed
 anna hajaare ko manaane kii koshishon ke tahat maharashtra ke mantri girish mahajan ahmednagar jaakar unase mili the lekin ye koshish vifal rahi
 Speaking to Aaj Tak, Maharashtra Education and Water Minister Girish Mahajan said that Anna has many demands regarding the Lokpal and farmers
 jo turant puri nahin ho sakati jabaki sarkaar prayaas kar rahi he
 it will take time
 girish mahajan ne swasthya or umr ko dekhte hue anna hajaare se satyagrah waapas lene kii apil kii
 On the other hand, Anna Hazare said that the movement will take place on March 23 at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan
 kya he anna ke andolan kaa kaarykram23 march se dilli main anna hajaare or unki nai team modi sarkaar ke khilaaf andolan shuru karne ja rahi he
 Anna Hazare will leave for Delhi on 21 March

 He attacked the present central government directly and said that this government has weakened this law
 inke dimag main satta paisa satta paisa kaa khel chal rahaa he
 Therefore, they have decided that on 23 March, they will do a do-or-die movement in Delhi on the main demands of the farmers
 patna main jepi ke nivas sthaan charkha samiti main kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue unhone kaha ki 35 saalon se andolan kar rahaa hum soochna ke adhikaar ke liye
 We fought for 8 years and finally enacted this law
 logon ko isse kaaphi laabh bhi mil rahaa he
 This makes us very happy
 unhone kaha ki bahut saare kanoon ham logon ne banawaye jaise gram sabha kaa kanoon evam anya kanoon bhi ham logon ne banwaaya
 Know, what are the demands of Anna? Anna Hazare said that you will remember that we were sitting in Delhi for 16 days only on hunger strike and finally the government had to bow down
 kanoon to ban gaya he lekin yah ab thik se kaam nahin kar rahaa he
 People are not getting notifications
 anna hajaare ne kaha ki hamaara kahana he ki sarkaar ke niyantran main jo bhi ayog he jaise krishi mulya ayog chunaav ayog niti ayog yaa is tarah ke anya ayog se sarkaar kaa niyantran hatana chahie or use sanvaidhanik darja milanaa chahie

 To win the political battle of Uttar Pradesh, the Congress has also brought its last brahmastra into politics
 priyanka gandhi ko congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne party mahasachiv banaate hue uttar pradesh ke purvanchal kii jimmedaari saunpi he
 The big leaders of the Congress are saying that the workers are excited with Priyanka's entry into the party, but the question is whether her political knock will be able to make the Congress alive on the ventilator in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections or will the bjp's path be difficult Tell us that one thing is said in the politics of the country that if the road to power in Delhi passes through UP, then the political history of the country behind it Trust too
 upi ne ab tak sabase zyada pradhanmantri die hai
 There are 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 yani centre main sarkaar banane ke liye jitani siten chahie uski kareeb ek tihaai
 With the landing of Priyanka, in the interesting battle of UP, the BJP alliance won 73 seats in the state in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when its mission was successful 272 plus
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ke liye isi raste ko band karne ke koshish ke tahate sapa-basapa ne haath milaayaa he
 At the same time, now Priyanka has also made political contest interesting after getting into active politics and getting the responsibility of UP
 raajnneetik vishleshak kaashi prasad yadav kehete hai, 'priyanka gandhi ke aane ke baad pradesh kaa raajnneetik sameekaran main badlaav dikhegaa khaskar purvi uttar pradesh main jahaan kii jimmedaari unhen saunpi gai he
 The upper caste vote bank of the Congress has shifted to BJP at present, Priyanka will try to bring it back
 isse sidhaa nuksaan bijepi ko hoga
 'the arithmetic of the SP-BSP alliance also deteriorates, saying that by bringing Priyanka, the Congress can damage the BJP as well as the SP-BSP alliance
 priyanka kii lokapriyata ke chalate congress kii reliyon main bheed jutegi, jisamen party abhi tak safal nahin ho paa rahi thi
 Apart from this, only Muslim community votes in slogans, speeches and emotion in the state, in such a situation Priyanka can influence this community too
 ek daur main ye congress kaa paramparaagat votbank rahaa he priyanka waapas laane main safal rahati hai to phir sapa-basapa ko bhi nuksaan uthaanaa padaa saktaa he
 In bjp's upper caste votes, senior journalist Himanshu Mishra says, "congress has given Priyanka Gandhi a choice for the forward castes
 haal hi main paanch rajyon main hue vidhansabha chunaav main agadi jatiyon kii naaraazgi ke chalate bijepi ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa he, jise 10 fisadi savarna aarakshan dekar maanakar chal rahi thi ki wo party ke saath jude rahenge or obisi votbank ko saadhane main juty thi
 In such a situation, the Congress has given a big blow to the BJP by running Priyanka's bet
 'mishra kehete hai ki priyanka ko purvanchal kii jimmedaari saunpi gai hai, jahaan kii raajnneeti dhuree brahman or rajput hai
 However, politically, the two communities are considered to be bitter opponents of each other
 upi main bijepi ke satta main aane ke baad brahman ko wo tavajjo nahin mil saki, jisaki wo ummid lagaae hue the
 In such a situation, Brahmins can be given a choice

 congress or bijepi kaa paaramparik taur par votbank savarna samudaay rahaa he
 But this section is not with the Congress for the last few decades
 savarna bijepi ke saath rahakar apni pahchaan banaae hue he
 Priyanka's arrival does not necessarily make her return to the Congress
 haalanki, ye tabhi waapas aayega jab unhen lagegaa ki 2019 main banane vaali sarkaar main congress ek badi bhoomika adaa karegi
 Actually, Purvanchal is a strong stronghold of BJP
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or soobe ke siem yogi adityanath ke saath-saath bijepi ke adhyaksh mahendra nath pandeya purvi uttar pradesh se pratinidhitiv karte hai
 However, this area was once a strong fort of the Congress

 Priyanka has a big challenge to reinforce the roots of Congress in this area? saudi arab ne DNA test se is baat kii pushti kii he ki do saal pehle jedda main america consulate ke aage bam visphot kar khud ko uda lene vaala fidaayin hamalavar bhartiya tha

 My friend Narbhas Lal had descended on this earth when the sterilization program was going on in the country with all its might
 unke pita dubba laal nasbandi kaarykram ke mureed the, lekin mureed banane se pehle hi 6 santanon ke pita ban chuke the
 So, by sterilization, he had eliminated the possibility of Narbhas Lal coming to this earth
 nasbandi bhi unhone apane parampriy mitra or prasiddh doctor thole se karavaaya tha
 But it is said that who can stop anyone who has to come
 jaise narendra modi ko dobaaraa satta main aane se rokane ke liye sabhi vipakshi dalon ne nasbandi na sahi, lekin jugalbandi jarur kii thi, phir bhi modi dobaaraa satta main aa hi dhamke
 Just like that, the seventh child arrived at Dubba Lal's house
 sharmaate-ghabaraate hue dubba laal shikayati lahaze main jab doctor thole se mili or saatvin santan ke aane kii soochna di to doctor thole lambii chuppi saadh gaye
 Dubba Lal when Dr
 thole kaa yah haal dekha to unhe apane mitra kii is dasha par taras aayaa
 Dubba Lal said, 'choke! Why are you getting nervous, what is your point of sterilization on the land where children are born in the eyes, ears, nose and even the pitcher
 khayr betaa hua to iskaa namakaran to kar hi do
 ' Dr
 thole ne raahat mahasoos kii lekin apni manodasha ke mutabik unhone bachche kaa namakaran narbhas laal kar diya
 Thus, a gem named Narbhas Lal grew young while growing, growing and playing in this country
 apane naam ke saath narbhas laal ne kabhi ninsaphi nahin kii he
 During school days, a teacher told him that a real student is one who has a lot of questions in mind
 har baat main jiske man main ‘kyon’ uthta rahe, vahi param gyani chaatr he
 Narbhas Lal tied this knot
 class main itane sawaal karne lage ki shikshak or narbhas laal ke sahpaathee pareshaan ho gaye
 Then a teacher found a way to avoid the outbreak of Narbhas Lal's 'why'
 shikshak narbhas laal ko yah bataane main safal rahe ki kyon kaa uttar khud talasho or use duniyaan ko bataao tabhi narbhas laal kaa naam puure jagat main prasiddh hoga
 In this way, after birth and knowledge, Narbhas Lal has been present among all of us
 desh-videsh kii har ek ghatana par unki nigaah rahati he
 Every day, he contemplates something and continues to confront me with his original thoughts
 yadi main chuttee par rahata hum to vah phone karke mujhe apane vichaaron se avgat karana nahin bhoolatey hai
 They have persuaded me or say that i have had to agree to get rid of them, that every week, i will convey one or two of their original ideas to the readers
 so ab har hafte narbhas laal kaa funda aapke saamne prastut karata rahoonga
 Yes, he has given one clear warning that, in the beginning, it should be made clear that whatever readers try to find the correctness of the language and the elegance of grammar, they will feel disappointed
 thik vaise hi jaise ravivaar ko england ke khilaaf em
 s
 dhoni kii batting dekh kar bhartiya team ke samarthakon ko niraashaa haath lagi
 Disappointed Narbhas is also red but he is also angry with Dhoni
 kal raat se hi narbhas laal dhoni ke khilaaf anaap-shanaap bole ja rahe hai
 i told him that he could not walk his bat many times
 yah sunakar dhoni ke saath saath mujh par bhi krodhit ho gaye
 How does the bat not move? ‘tumne dekha nahin madhya pradesh main ek vidhayak ne jivan main pehali baar balla pakadaa or de danaa dan dho daalaa adhikari ko
 And it is not that the father of this MLA gave him a bat
 uske pita to bataur mahayor adhikariyon ko jutiya kar hi femes hue the
 Dhoni (dhoni) has been batting all his life
 kam se kam video par us vidhayak ko balla bhaanjte dekh letaa to phir helicopter shaat to pakkaa hi maar saktaa tha
 'I told Narbhas Lal to change the point that i did not see the result of the mla's batting, he had to go to jail
 narbhas laal kahaan chup hone vaale
 Immediately speaking, what happened when, when he came out from the prison on the bell, how did the thick garland (necklace) of the marigold flower put him around his neck
 khayr main bolaa chaahe jo ho jail jane ke baad vah dobaaraa phir kisi adhikari ko balle se nahin pitega
 Narbhas Lal said, 'your assessment is fine
 betaa to apane baap kaa he dobaaraa charchaa main tabhi aayega jab kisi adhikari ko juutiyane kaa karnama karegaa
 Well why have you followed the poor MLA
 uttar pradesh main dekha nahin tha ek hi dal main kaam karne vaale ek saansad ne apni hi party ke ek vidhayak ko bhari meeting main kaise juutiya diya tha
 Narbhas Lal said, Actually, the way the whole world rotates in a circle, in the same way the thundering, thrashing, jutienne, slapping, banging with the tree, touring, banging, stripping, banging and lying
 , a cycle of standing and beating
 yah chakra shaswat he
 For some time, it has also been given the name of maw lynching
 sarkaar kaa chakra, isi shaswat chakra ke saath chalata he or chalata rahegaa
 i got lost in Narbhas Lal's talk and started going through a frightening fantasy, when Narbhas Lal shrieked and said, "are you gone?" Before i could say anything, Narbhas Lal extended my cup of tea to me
 chalate-chalate narbhar laal ne hidaayat di he ki "uski bhaasa se koi chherchhaar na kii jaae" isi vajah se upar kii bhashaa ko avikal aapke saamne aksharshah prastut kiya janaa meri baadhyataa rahi he

 Demonstrating in front of Rajghat, Delhi BJP said that Kejriwal should give water and electricity properly before complete statehood to Delhi
 party ke pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne kaha ki kejariwal ko purna rajya se koi matlab nahin balki wo apni asafalataaon ko chhipaane ke makasad se purna rajya kii baat kar rahe hai
 He also said that Madan Lal Khurana, Sahib Singh Verma and Sheela Dixit were the Chief Ministers of Delhi, but none of them stopped the work and neither of these made the absence of a full state a means to hide their failure
 lekin kejariwal ne purna rajya kii baat kar pichley saadhe teen saalon kii naakaamiyon ko chhipaane kii koshish kii he
 Apart from Manoj Tiwari, hundreds of activists including the three General Ministers participated in the Delhi BJP demonstration
 vahiin dilli vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh vijendra gupta ne kaha ki kejariwal ne indira gandhi indor stadium main dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja die jane kii maang ko lekar nae naatak ke liye apni puri takat jhonk di he
 Gupta alleged that this was a sign of political frustration of a failed and defeated leader
 gupta ne aarope lagaaya ki dilli waalon kii parvaah naa karte hue kejariwal ne jhooth or dhokhe kaa aisa dhaancha khadaa kar diya he jo unke bache hue kaarykaal main unke liye bahaane kaa kaam karegaa jabaki sachai ye he ki mukhyamantri ko vartmaan dhaanche main jo shaktiyaan mili hui hai kejariwal un tak kaa sahi se istemaal nahin kar paae hai
 Gupta said that this system has been working with full success since when the Delhi Assembly is formed
 gupta ne janalokapal ke jariye bhi kejariwal par tanj ksaa or kaha ki 'aisa hi ek naatak kejariwal ne janalokapal bill ko lekar kiya
 Kejriwal could not even present it in the Assembly
 ' unhone kaha ki kejariwal pehle uparajyapal ke daftar main sofe par dharne par baith gaye or 9 din tak mukhyamantri or unki mantri parishad soti rahi
 After this, the Chief Minister left for a 10-day vacation in Bangalore due to personal reasons and now when he has come back to Delhi, there is no mood to run his rule
 bijepi kii kejariwal se maangabijepi ne kejariwal se sawaal poocha he or kaha he ki mukhyamantri ko is baat kaa jawaab dena hoga ki unhone pani kii killat dur karne ke liye, pradooshan kam karne ke liye or pedo ko kaatane se bachaane ke liye kya kiya?

 is video main dikh rahe amaar malik naam ke is bachche ne anjaane main iphone x ko analock kiya phir uske parents ne yah video banane kaa faisla kiya
 This video has been uploaded to youtube by a user named Ataullah Malik
 is video ke discripshan main likhaa gaya he, ‘hamane utyub par videos kii baadh dekhi he jisamen log iphone x ko aajamaa rahe hai or hamane isaki phase idi ko bevakoof banane kii koshish kii he
 It was not our intention after taking the iphone X, but on November 3, when we got it set up, after this we were sitting in the bedroom when our 10 year old son came and took the iphone X
 meri patni ne kaha ki usne apane phase idi se lock kiya he or koi doosraa nahin khol saktaa
 But this did not happen and iphonex was unlocked after seeing the son's face
 ’vird portal se kii gai baatcheet main ataullah ne kaha he ki unhone ise jitani baar tri kiya utani baar analock hua

 thalsena pramukh ne yah bhi kaha tha ki doklam ilaake main chini sainikon kii sankhya main kaaphi kami ai he
 Not commenting on the reduction in the number of troops, Lu Kang said, 'chinese soldiers stationed and patrolling in the Doklam area are exercising sovereignty rights and retaining territorial sovereignty according to historical traditions
 ’lu ne general ravat kii is tippanee par bhi pratyaksh taur se kuch nahin kaha ki bharat evam china ne arunachal pradesh ke tuting main bhartiya kshetra main sadak banane kii chini sainikon kii yojana se judaa masalaa disambar ke aakhri hafte main sulajhaa liya
 He reiterated China's claim on Arunachal Pradesh
 china arunachal ko dakshin tibet kaa hissaa bataata rahaa he
 Lu said, 'my coworkers have reacted to this question many times
 mujhe doharaana hoga ki china-bharat seemaa ke purvi hisse main baari vivaad he
 'he said,' Therefore, we have to reach agreement through consensus
 lekin isse pehle hamen shanti evam suraksha barkaraar rakhane kii jarurat he

 You can hate them, have fun defeating them or call them insubstantial, but you cannot deny that Australia is the world's strongest team right now that has won the world victories in five different continents
 Ho
 is team ne pichley paanch main se 4 vishwa-cap apane naam kar itnaa to bataa diya he ki uske paas cricket kaa ek aisa dhaancha taiyaar he jisase har kisi ko jalan ho sakati he
 Constant defeat and failure plaguing them and they are unable to bear it
 koi sitara aae yaa koi adhikari jaae jeet kii unki bhukh kabhi khatm nahin hoti
 With Michael Clarke holding this World Cup in his hands, he will never be seen in a colorful jersey for his country
 bahut mumkin bhi he ki michel johnson, bread hadine or shen watson sarike sitare agle vishwa cap main nazar naa aaen lekin itnaa to maan kar chaliye ki agle vishwa cap main bhi is team kaa dabadabaa hoga
 To make a great team, you need to have great bowlers and at the moment, Australia's team is more than young and fast bowlers
 michel stark- 25 saal, josh hezalwood- 24 saal, james fohonar- 24 saal, pat cumins 21 saal or james patinson 24 saal, itane fit or tej yuva gendbaajon kaa team main hona baaki tiimon ke liye khatre kii ghanti he
 Yes, the team still does not have a good spinner but this shortfall can be more in test matches, not in small format
 in sabake saath agar aap steven smith kaa form or kamitment bhi jod den to is team ko aage aane vaale samay main aisa captain milane vaala he jisaki umr bhale hi 23 saal ho lekin usne kuch hi maheenon main australia ke har aalochak kaa dil jeet liya he
 But it will also be interesting to see how this team plays outside their home because in the last few years the D
 africa ke alaava koi bhi team aisi nahin rahi jisane apane ghar se baahar khelte hue zyaada prabhavit kiya ho
 But discussion about this question before time is also not right
 jis chiz ko aap apni takat samajhate hai, australia ke khilaadi us par sabase pehle hamalaa karte hai
 The team has achieved the distinction of being champions in the World Cup, so the time is still celebratory
 vahiin is vishwa cap se itnaa to tay ho gaya ki vanade cricket kii maut itani jaldi nahin hone vaali jitna ki kuch cricket-pandit akasar bhavishyavaanee karte rahete hai magar is toornament kii kamyaabi ko koi is baat kii ganrati na samajhe ki vanade cricket kii vaapasi hone vaali he
 The ODI series between the two countries is still not much of an audience
 haa, asia cap, champions trophy or vishwa jaise toornament abhi bhi logon main desh prem jagaa dete hai jisase vanade kii raunak laut aati he
 Hopefully, the ICC will have understood this too now
 newjiland kii tarif bhi kerani zaruri he
 The performance of the team in every ICC tournament is such that the fans never fail
 is desh main cricket khilne vaale khilaadiyon kaa pool yaa sankhya shaayad utane hi honge jitne ke bharat ke kisi chote zile main lekin fir bhi team hameshaa nidar cricket or jhujaaru ravaiye se har kisi ko apana kaayal banaati
 Everyone is praising Brandon mccullum's captaincy but i don't think he is in the league of Dhoni or Clarke
 kiwi team apni paristhitiyon main hameshaa acha khelti ai he or is vishwa cap ne unhen bataaya ki aane vaale samay main ye barkaraar rahegaa
 D
 africa kii kya baat karen? inke tallent par kabhi kisi ko koi shaq nahin rahaa he
 It is not difficult to understand the pain and anger of the fans of this country
 team kyon nahin jeet paati he iskaa jawaab kisi ke paas nahin he
 People call them chokers, perhaps this is a testimony of how much they expect from this team
 kehete hai lack ek hi ganranti ke saath aata he ki wo kabhi bhi badal saktaa he magar protiyaaz kii kismat he ki abhi tak in se ruthaa hua he
 All he needs is a lucky captain
 west indies or england se to ab inke phens bhi maayoos nahin balki noummid ho chale hai
 For many years, cricket has been going on in ram-bharosa
 west indies main to ye khel kab tak chalegaa ye kahana bhi mushkil ho gaya he
 There has never been a shortage of talent here, but where players have no pride in playing for the country, where the defeat after defeat does not disturb the players and officials, where there is no system of any kind
 Come, how can the condition and direction of cricket be good there
 vahiin england par dayaa aati he
 The game which he spread across the world has now become alien to him
 itane majboot cricket ke dhaanche ke hote hue bhi agar koi team hameshaa maayoos kare to kami adhikariyon or chayankartaaon kii zyaada ho jaati he
 As long as the English Cricket Board does not learn from its mistakes and adopt an ostrich-like attitude, the results will not change for this country
 bharat ke bare main kya kahana
 The team set a record for consecutive wins
 virdohi tiimon ko ol-out karne kaa bhi record banaaya
 With the format of the World Cup, it was decided that Team India will reach the quarter-finals
 upar se bangladesh ke khilaaf quarter-final main bhidane se aakhri chaar main janaa bhi tay ho gaya
 But the match against Australia also revealed the difference between the two teams
 team ne aisa pradarshan kiya ki phens maayoos na hon or ghar aane par ipel kii chakachaundh ke bich sabhi sawaal kahin kho jaaen
 In the coming time, Team India has to play on their favorite pitches in their home, i
e
 the voices of All Is Well will keep coming
 khilaadiyon kaa pradarshan kaisaa tha ye isi se pataa chalata he ki jab isisi ne apni vishwa cap kii team banaai to kisi bhi bhartiya khilaadi ko usamen jagah nahin mili
 Although it is a matter of thinking whether it is under-19 cricket or an emerging cricket tournament, India's performance is always great and we always do better than Australia but when it comes to making these young players great, our system Beats the kangaroos

 shuukravaar se anna hajaare ramlila maidan main dikhenge
 It is clear that he has wide public support, but from here his challenges become much bigger
 teen din puri thasak ke saath tihaad main anshan karte rahe anna
 
 
 For three days, in front of Tihar, Huzum kept shouting slogans for him and the Delhi Police swelled hands and feet
 pehle police sharten thope rahi thi, baad main sari sharten maanane lagi
 Now Anna has been given Ramlila grounds for hunger strike

 But the challenge for Team Anna does not end here

 a large section of social workers, including people like Aruna Roy and Nikhil Dey, is not in favor of Jan Lokpal

 That is, Anna's demand that the bill be passed in this session cannot be met
 phir lagata nahin ki nyaaypalika ko lokapal ke daayre main rakhane kii bhi unki maang puri hogi
 So what will Team Anna do? Will the hunger strike be so long that either Anna Hazare gets in trouble or has to keep parliamentary traditions on hold
 lekin kaha ja rahaa he ki team anna ko bhi yah ehsaas he or vah aage lacheelaapan dikhaa sakati he
 However, till now his stance has been very strict
 ek tarah se gend ab uske paale main he or use tay karnaa he ki lokapal par apane andolan ko vah koun sa mukaam degi

 Firuja Parikh spoke on late childbearing women through urban isolation, stress and surrogacy

 The statement of the education minister of the country's largest state shows that the world may have changed but the way of teaching and learning of children has also changed but the mindset has not changed

 a lot of bounce on the wicket Apart from this, a question is whether the spinner role will be more important in Kingsmead where the pitch is likely to slow down

 Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan is known as a meteorologist in politics, or whenever he changes the ground, his opponents accuse him of being a meteorologist who does not make a mistake in finding the political wind
 jawaharlal nehru vishvidhyalay chaatr sangh ke adhyaksh kanhaiya kumaar ke mudde par wo khul kar bhartiya janata party ke rukh se alag dikhe
 At a communist conference in Patna on Thursday, Ram Vilas Paswan said, 'we have our sympathies with Kanhaiya, belong to Bihar
 hamaari sahanubhuti he, wo jawan hai or nirvaachit adhyaksh hai
 ' paswan ne na keval kanhaiya ke saath khul kar sahanubhuti dikhaai balki jawahar laal nehru vishvidhyalay kii ho rahi aalochana par bhi apana rukh saafe karte hue kaha ki vahaan se ek se ek log is samay desh main jiladhikari or espi hue or apatkaal ke dauraan vah khud do maheene vahiin chhipe the
 Certainly Paswan's statement will not please the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party and their allies in the central government
 tippaniyan But Paswan said that no one becomes a traitor by going to a meeting
 lekin unhone saath main yah bhi kaha ki lakshmana rekha ko paar karnaa gaiyr kanoonee he
 But about Kanhaiya, he said that this is the subject of investigation and the matter should be thoroughly investigated
 ramvilas paswan ne jate-jate ye bhi kah daalaa ki wo vichaardhaara kii svantrtaa ke pakshdhar hai lekin unhone ye bhi kaha ki rashtrawaad or dharmanirpekshata alag-alag nahin balki ek hi hai
 These simple words of Paswan are certainly shocking and especially his silence on the issue of Rohit Vemula but his stance on the subject of Kanhaiya makes it clear that he is convinced that the Center Sircar and Delhi Police have against Kanhaiya There is no evidence to hold him guilty of treason
 or dalit samudaay kii naaraazgi jhel rahe paswan or adhik maun rah kar apane samarthakon ko niraash nahin karnaa chaahate
 On the issue of Kanhaiya Kumar, the president of Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union, he was openly different from the attitude of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 guuruuvaar ko patna main ek sanvadata sammelan main ramvilas paswan ne kaha, 'kanhaiya ke saath hamaari hamadardi he, bihar ke hai
 We have sympathy, they are young and elected president
 ' Paswan not only showed open sympathy with Kanhaiya but also clarified his stand on the criticism of Jawaharlal Nehru University, that from there one to one people became District Magistrates and sps in the country at this time and during the Emergency, he himself Months were hidden there
 nishchit rup se paswan ke is vaktavy se bhartiya janata party ke netaa or centre sarkaar main unke sahyogi khush nahin honge
 The comments lekin paswan ne kaha ki kisi sabha main jane se koi deshadrohi nahin ho jaataa
 But they also said that crossing the Lakshman Rekha is illegal
 lekin kanhaiya ke bare main unhone kaha ki ye jaanch kaa vishay he or is maamle kii puri jaanch honi chahie
 Ram Vilas Paswan while going on also said that he was in favor of the freedom of ideology but he also said that nationalism and secularism are not the same but separate
 paswan ke ye nape tule bol nishchit rup se chaunkaane vaale hai or khaskar rohit vemula ke mudde par unki chuppi lekin kanhaiya ke vishay par unka rukh saafe karata he ki wo is baat ko lekar nishcint hai ki centre sarakar or dilli police ke paas kanhaiya ke khilaaf koi aisa sakshya nahin hai jisase use rashtradroh ke maamle main doshi qaraar diya jaae
 And Paswan, who is resentful of the Dalit community, does not want to disappoint his supporters by remaining more silent
 paswan ne na keval kanhaiya ke saath khul kar sahanubhuti dikhaai balki jawahar laal nehru vishvidhyalay kii ho rahi aalochana par bhi apana rukh saafe karte hue kaha ki vahaan se ek se ek log is samay desh main jiladhikari or espi hue or apatkaal ke dauraan vah khud do maheene vahiin chhipe the

 IANS se input Global temperatures remain a concern in international forums, but a study has indicated that plants deal with this much better
 vaigyanikon kaa maananaa tha ki paudhon kii vajah se bhi vaishvik taapan hota he lekin naye adhyayan ke mutabik isamen paudhon kaa yogadan pehle ke akalan kii tulana main kam hota he
 Scientists believe that when they are heated, their respiration process becomes difficult and during this time the greenhouse gases emit carbon dioxide
 isliye ve aisa sochate the ki logon kii gatividhiyon ke alaava paudhon kaa bhi vaishvik taapan main yogadan hota he
 Generally, plants take carbon dioxide during photosynthesis during the day and release carbon dioxide at night
 lekin prakaash sanshleshan ke dauraan paudhe jis anupaat main carbon daai-oxide grahan karte hai, uski tulana main kam maatra main is gas kaa tyaag karte hai
 The comments is adhyayan kaa prakaashan procedings of da neshnal academy of science main kiya gaya he
 (this news has not been edited by the NDTV team
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Scientists believed that plants also cause global warming, but according to new studies, the contribution of plants in this is less than earlier estimates
 vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki jab ye garm ho jate hai to inke shwasan kii prakriya kathin ho jaati he or is dauraan greenhouse gas carbon daai-oxide utsarjit hoti rahati he
 So they thought that apart from the activities of people, plants also contribute to global warming
 aam taur par din main prakaash sanshleshan ke dauraan paudhe carbon-daai oxide grahan karte hai or raat main carbon daai-oxide chhodte hai
 But during photosynthesis, plants discard this gas in small quantities compared to the proportion in which carbon dioxide is absorbed

 purv kendriya mantri pi chidambaram ko rouj avenue court sthit sibiai kii vishesh adalatamen pesh kiya gaya
 He was sent on CBI remand till 26 August
 parivaar or vakil ko har roj 30-30 minute ke liye chidambaram se milane kii ijazat di gai he
 The judge said, remanding after hearing the facts is correct
 har 48 ghante main medical ekzamination ke liye kaha gaya he
 Kapil Sibal on behalf of Chidambaram, while Tushar Mehta on behalf of CBI argued in the court
 sibiai ne 5 din kii remand kii maang kii he
 He also spoke to Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Manu Singhvi in the Chidambaram courtroom
 chidambaram ke bete karti bhi court main maujuud hai
 The CBI told the court, "arrested them after non-bailable warrants were issued
" duusare aropiyon ke aamane saamne bithakar poochtacha kerani he
 Chidambaram is not cooperating in the investigation
 sibiai kaa kahana he ki chidambaramane puure dastavej nahin die baar-baar kehane ke baad bhi dastavej uplabdh nahin karwaae
 The CBI handed over the High Court order to the court
 sibiai ne court ko bataaya ki ''hicort ne agrim jamaanat khaarij kar di he
 In this case, the charge sheet is not yet filed
 ham pre chargeshit stage par hai, hamen kuch dastavejon kaa intazaar he
 The accused has been avoiding questions
 inaki castodial interogeshan kii jarurat he
 "CBI submitted case diary in court
 agyaat adhikariyon ne apni pojishan kaa galat istemaal kiya
 INX Media paid the money and interest to the company
 indrani mukherjee ne 50 lakh dollar die
 The correct information will be found in the inquiry itself
 isamen puri ek mani trail he
 At present, the arguments of CBI have been completed
 pi chidambaram kii ore se kapil sibbal ne court main kaha,is cese main aaropee karti hai, jinhen 23 march main 2018 ko bel mil chuki he
 The second accused Bhaskar Raman has been granted anticipatory bail in the same court
 hycourt ke jajment se aisa lagata he ki ek draft chargeshit taiyaar ho chuki he
 So it seems that the investigation has been completed
 is cese main sarkaar ke 6 sachivon ne FIPB apruval diya, unamem se koi giraftaar nahin kiya gaya
 These people approved the FIPB, which was then approved by the Finance Ministry
 kapil sibbelane bahes menage kaha,10 saal baad cese darj kiya gaya
 Chidambaram was questioned only once by the CBI
 chidambaram kabhi poochtacha se kabhi nahin bhaage
 If Chidambaram is avoiding questions, then CBI should put all those things in the court
 kapil sibbal ne court ke saamne kaha, chidambaram se 12 sawaal puche gaye, jinamein 6 ke jawaab chidambaram pichhali poochtacha main de chuke he
 From the arrest yesterday till 11 am, the CBI did not conduct any inquiry, while Chidambaram repeatedly asked for questioning
 ye cese dastavejon par aadhaarit he
 If money is received then it must have gone to an account, which account is it, who gave the money, when? Where was 5 million dollars given? Sibal asked the judge to look in the case diary if he had written something like this
 kapil sibbal ne bahes main kaha, jo sawaal pehle puche gaye vahiin dubaara puche ja rahe hai
 Why did these people not inquire for a long time after interrogation once
 agrim jamaanat kaa aadesh 7 maheene tak latakaaya gaya
 Remand cannot be granted on the basis of charges only
 iske baad abhishek manu singhvi ne chidambaram ke taraf se bahes kiya
 He said, the six secretaries who took the decision of FIPB were not even tried to arrest them, because they are not in public life
 indrani mukherjee ne farvari 2018 main court main bayaan diya tha, yah ladi (indrani mukherjee) june 2019 main sarkari gavaah ban gayi
 He was not called for questioning for 14 months and now he is under arrest
 kya sarkari gavaah bananaa koi saboot he? kya uske aadhaar par giraftaar kar sakate hai?jaj ne poocha, chidambaram ko saman kab jari kiya gaya tha?singhvi ne kaha, june 2018 main
 You can't find the answer you want to hear
 phir jaj ne kaha, jo jawaab he vahi to denge
 Singhvi said that Chidambaram would not answer what the CBI wants to hear
 singhvi ne is bahes main aage kaha, mehta ne remand to maangi he par koi aarope in par nahin lagaaya he
 What are the allegations? The entire CBI approach is wrong in this case
 chidambaram se koi tripal risk nahin, flite risk, matlab bhaagane kaa, gavaahon ko prabhavit karne kaa or saboot mitaane kaa
 This is not a strong case for custody
 remand ko lekar sibiai ke vakil tushaar mehta, kapil sibbal or abhishek manu singhvi main ek saath tikhi bahes bhi hui
 There was no development in this case after 6 June 2018
 sibiai ke vakil tushaar mehta ne phir se kaha, jo chidambaram ko pataa he wo nahin bataa rahe hai
 Chidambaram tried to say something on this, but the CBI lawyer stopped
 mehta ne kaha ki 2 vakil pehle hi court main bahes kar rahe hai
 On behalf of the CBI, Tusshar Mehta said, it takes time till a conclusion is reached in the investigation of serious fraud
 20 june 2018 main nae tathy saamne aae
 Soon after, Chidambaram got relief from the High Court
 ye arest karne ke baad aaj bhi sawaalon se batch rahe hai
 The High Court also believed that it was not worth granting bail
 ham bina castodial interogeshan ke sachai tak nahin pahunch sakate
 We cannot tell about the investigation in public
 chidambaram apana paksh rakhana chaahate the, lekin sibiai ne virodh kiya or kaha, ye galat parampara hogi
 Chidambaram said, "I did not answer every question nor did i take money
" mere bete kaa videsh main acount he uski jaankaree maine sibiai ko de di he
 i do not have an account abroad
 ''bataa den, purv kendriya mantri pi chidambaram kii beeti raat sibiai ke headquarter ke guest house main gujri
 He was arrested by the CBI from his house on Wednesday evening
 giraftaar ke baad unhen sibiai ke headquarter laayaa gaya tha, jahaan raat main unhen guest house ke 'suite-3' main rakhaa gaya
 Officials said that it is normal for the agency to place high-profile accused in a guest house to ensure proper security and surveillance

 President Donald Trump sacked his National Security Advisor (NSA) John Bolton and soon announced his announcement of a new NSA
 trump ne do twit kar bolton kii barkhaastagi kaa elaan kiya or saaf kar diya ki unki or jon bolton kii nitiyaan mail nahin khaatin
 John Bolton is counted among the bureaucrats of America who can go to any lengths to enforce their policy
 phir chaahe baat yuddh kii hi kyon naa ho
 He owes a tough stand to the US in Iran, North Korea, Afghanistan and this is what led to a dispute between him and Donald Trump and eventually he had to step down
 is khabar ko clic kar padhein: trump ke wo twit jinase duniya ko mili badi braking newsjon bolton 15 saal kii umr se hi republican party ke samarthak rahe hai or republican party ke raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar bairi goldwater (1964) ke liye bolton ne skool main prachaar kiya tha
 Since then, he has been working continuously for this party and has been a part of policy decisions for the last 2-3 decades
 unki niti hameshaa aakraamak rahi, jo kisi bhi desh se yuddh ke liye taiyaar, kai deshon main satta parivartan ke pakshdhar rahe hai
 Here is a look at some aspects related to John Bolton's aggressive policy: - In 1998, John Bolton has been the project director of the American agency New American Century, which supported the war with Iran
 - north korea ke saath beete dinon donald trump ne dosti ke kadam uthaae the, lekin jon bolton kii niti alag he
 Bolton believes that the US should strike North Korea without delay, otherwise it could become a threat
 - beete dinon jab trump-kim jong un kii mulaakaat radd hui to uske peeche jon bolton kii niti hi thi
 Because John Bolton laid many difficult conditions in front of North Korea
 - iran or america ke bich is vakt parmaanu deal ko lekar talkhi chal rahi he
 John Bolton has the same policy regarding Iran, if he does not agree, then he should bomb it
 bolton kii isi niti kii vajah se donald trump ne apane videsh mantri rex tilarsan ko hataa diya tha
 Click and read this news: Who are John Bolton who Trump sacked as NSA - When Barack Obama started talking about nuclear deal with Iran in 2015, John Bolton strongly opposed it
 or neuyork times main ek lekh main likhaa tha ki ab vakt aa gaya he ki ection shuru kiya jaae
 - 'there is no need for the United Nations', believed John Bolton
 jab jon bolton ko jorge bush ne sanyukt raashtra main ambesder banaakar bheja to unhone ek bhaashan main kaha ki duniya ko UN kii jarurat nahin he, duniya ko samay aane par taqatvar desh disha dikhaa sakate hai
 And America is the most powerful

 Even though the world considers Donald Trump an aggressor, John Bolton is far ahead
 unki chale to vah iran, syria, venezuela, yaman, cuba or north korea main satta parivartan karvaa den or agar aisa naa ho to iske liye vah yuddh bhi kar sakate hai

 (ieenes se input) Terming the cag's methods of evaluating 2G spectrum allocation as seriously flawed, the government on Friday said that there was no 'revenue loss' in its allocation and the telecom policy of 'first come, first serve' by the Vajpayee government Was made sanchaar evam soochna praudyogiki mantri kapil sibbal ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘2 ji spectrum aavanton kaa moolyankan karne main niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak (kaig) kii ore se apanaaye gaye taur tareekon se hamen kaaphi du:kha hua he or isamen dikhaaye gaye rajasav nukasana kaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 CAG in its report allocated 1 in spectrum allocation
 76 lakh karod rupee kaa rajasav nuksaan dikhaaya he lekin sibbal ne daawa kiya ki vastav main karadaataaon ko koi nuksaan nahin hua he
 He said that due to the report of the CAG, the government had to face an uncomfortable situation and now after the facts came out, the opposition especially the BJP would face an uncomfortable situation
 unhone kaha ki 1999 main pesh telikam niti vastav main vaajapeyi ke netritv vaali alpamat sarkaar ne pesh kii thi jabaki purv raashtrapati narayanan ke alaava purv pradhanmantri chandrashekhar or shiv sena netaa bal thakare tak ne iskaa virodh kiya tha
 But Vajpayee had justified this policy
 mukhya vipakshi party bhaajapa ko aade haathon lete hue sibbal ne kaha, ‘ab ham unheen kii niti kaa anusaran kar rahe hai to 1
 There is a talk of revenue loss of 76 lakh crores, which is really an attempt to spread confusion among the public
 ’mantri ne kaha ki disambar 2002 main rajg sarkaar ke samay pesh 10veen yojana ke dastavej main telikam kshetra ko aadharbhoot sanrachana kaa kshetra ghoshit karte hue use protsaahan pradaan karne kii prakruti kaa bataaya or is sambandh main rajasav arjan ko mukhya nirdharat nahin banane kaa jor diya gaya tha
 But today BJP is seen opposing its own policy
 kaig kii report main 2007-08 main spectrum aavanton main 122 license or dohare upyog vaale 35 praudyogiki license aavanton main karadaataaon ko 1,76,645 karod rupee kaa nuksaan dikhaaya gaya
 The Opposition has been firm on the demand for a probe by the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) into the matter, which had caused a halt in the winter session of Parliament
 sibbal ne kaha, ‘ham sabhi sansthaaon kaa puraa sammaan karte hai lekin kaig ke aankalan main gambhir khami or use koi takneekee ilm nahin he
 'he said 122 license 4
 4 mega hertz ke daayre ke the lekin kaig kaa akalan 6
 Was under 2 Mega Hz
 kaig ne akalan 2010 main kiya jabaki license 2008 main pradaan kiye gaye the
 Sibal questioned how you can estimate 2008 in line with the 2010 value
 isi prakaar se license par amal hone main bhi ek varsh kaa samay laga
 He said, "if we do complete estimation in a systematic manner, there is no revenue loss to the tax payers in the allocation of spectrum
 ’ mantri ne kaha ki mukhya vishay yah he ki rajg ke shasankaal ke dauraan license ke liye rajasav hissedari kii dar ko kis prakaar 15 pratishat se ghataakar pehle 10 pratishat or baad main 8 pratishat kar diya gaya
 Who benefited from this is the question
 sanchaar mantri ke rup main ramvilas paswan ke kaarykaal main 41 license, pramod mahajan ke kaarykaal main 18 license or arun shouri ke kaarykaal main 26 license jari kiye gaye
 While 25 licenses were issued during the tenure of Dainidhi Maran and 122 licenses during the tenure of A
 Raja
 sibbal ne kaha ki 1994 main mobile se prati kol kii dar 32 rupee thi, 1998-99 main yah ghatakar 16 rupee, 2000 main chah rupee 70 paise or aaj yah 30 paise prati kol ho gai he
 He said, 'who benefited from the allocation of spectrum is in front of everyone and the opposition's allegation is baseless
 spectrum aavanton ke kaaran desh ke anya kshetron main rahane vaale bihar, upi ke logon ko kaaphi phayda hua he or unhen 1,200 rupee masik bachat tak ho rahi he
 He said that the government is getting 30 percent revenue from the telecom sector
 isse kisaanon or machuaaron ko samaaj ke prayek varg ke logon ko jabardast laabh hua he or vipaksh 1
 It is talking about revenue loss of 76 lakh crore rupees which is not really there
 sibbal ne kaha, ‘kaig ne hamaare (sarkaar) saath anyaay kiya he, or vipaksh aam aadmi ke saath anyaay kar rahi he
 Because the common man has benefited from it
 ’ Criticizing the repeated violation of the court order to set up a tribunal to settle the interstate water dispute between Andhra Pradesh and Orissa, the Supreme Court questioned when the government would wake up from deep slumber

 '' gujarat main narmada nadi ke tat par ek aisa mandir he, jahaan ek chat ke neeche mahadev do roopon main darshan dete hai
 There are also two Nandi in this temple and that too face to face
 kehete hai jo koi in roopon ke darshan kaa saubhaahgya hasil kar letaa he use moksh kii prapti ho jaati he
 Call it the glory of Mahadev, the miracle of Shiva or the boon of Bholenath
 namarda kinare bane is mandir main bhakton ko ek nahin balki do roopon main mahadev darshan dete hai
 This is a wonderful and miraculous temple of Oughdadani built on the banks of river Narmada in Gujarat
 yahaan mahadev ke ek rup ko dhaneshwar to duusare ko lukeshwar ke naam se pukaarte hai
 It is said that Dhaneshwar Mahadev was established by Kubera himself
 kehete hai ravan ne jab kuber se sone kii lanka chin lee thi, tab kuber ne use waapas paane ke liye bhagwaan shiv kii tapasya kii
 Devotees worship the same form of Bhole Bhandari as Dhaneshwar
 dhaneshwar mahadev ke saath hi viraajane vaale lukeshwar mahadev mandir bhi utana hi pracheen he
 According to the mythological story of Vishnu, a woman named Bhasmasura, having got a boon by doing austerities to Mahadev that he would put his hand on it
 vardaan paane ke baad bhasmasur ek baar shiv ke peeche hi daud padaa, tab bhasmasur se darkar mahadev narmada kinare inhen jhaadiyon main chhip gaye the or tab bhagwaan vishnu ne stri rup dhaaran kar chal purvak bhasmasur kaa haath usee ke upar rakhwa diya
 Bhasmasura was burnt by his own boon and since then Bhole Bhandari came to be known as Lukeshwar here
 mahadev ke in do roopon dhaneshwar or lukeshwar mahadev kechamatkarako unke darbar main aane ke baad hi mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he
 On the one hand, while the devotees come here and get blessed by seeing the unique form of Mahadev, the devotees believe that coming here not only gives them peace but the naive Bhandari also gives the blessing of a happy life
 usase bhi badi baat ye he ki yahaan aakar brahmanon ko bhojan karaane se har tarah ke pitrudosha se bhakton ko chhutkaaraa mila jaataa he
 The glory and glory of this form of Mahadev extends far beyond the church
 har taraf se niraash bhakt jab mahadev ke darbar main aate hai to unhen kuch aisa chaiyn or sukun miltaa he ki bhakt bas yaheen ke hokar rah jate hai

 unke daavon or ladane-bhidane kii style ne dilli kii janata kaa dil bhi jeet liya
 He became the chief minister of the state by winning 67 out of 70 assembly seats, but his political immaturity and stubborn attitude in the last hundred days is showing political clout in Delhi
 vaise, raajnneetik kudon ke alaava dilli nagar nigam ke karmchaariyon kii hadtaal ke chalate dilli kii sadakon or mohallon main kooda-kachra bhi failata ja rahaa he
 The arrangements of Delhi, which Kejriwal is claiming to be a world-class city, are now seen creaking
 taaja vivaad aam aadmi party ke bade netaaon se judaa he
 Jitendra Tomar, who was made law minister by Arvind Kejriwal, is in the grip of law
 farji degree ke aarope main unke jhooth kii parat-dar-parat khulti ja rahi he
 The disease of obtaining a fake degree is not new, but the purity of which the Aam Aadmi Party has been talking about is enough to puncture it
 tomars par aarope pehle se the, lekin kejariwal ne un aaropon ko kabhi tavajjo nahin di
 When the Minister was arrested, the party and the government were troubled, then the Aam Aadmi Party decided to put an inquiry on Tomar
 aam aadmi party kii pichhali sarkaar main kanoon mantri rahe somnath bharti kii mushkilen bhi bad gai hai
 His wife has made serious allegations of domestic violence against him
 haalanki patni ke aaropon kii timming par sawalia nishaan jarur uthta he, lekin isse somnath bharti par lage aarope kamatar nahin ho jate hai
 Somnath Bharti and his wife also live separately, but this case has also damaged the image of the Aam Aadmi Party
 party haikaman kii in donon maamalon main kaaphi samay tak chuppi or ise sajeesh bataane kii koshishon se bhi phayda kam, nuksaan zyada ho rahaa he
 Apart from these two leaders, two other mlas of the common man are accused of showing fake degrees in the affidavit
 image ke naam par jis raajnneeti kaa kejariwal daawa karte rahe hai, ab vah un par baari padane laga he
 However, disputes started only after the Delhi government took over in February
 sarkaar main aane ke baad arvind kejariwal ne jis tarah se party ke sansthaapak sadasyon prashanth bhushan, yogendra yadav or anand kumaar ko party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya, usase bhi party kii chhavi ko nuksaan hua
 The Aam Aadmi Party was seen turning into a face party where the high command runs
 is jhagade se party ubarti, usase pehle dilli sarkaar or up rajyapal ke bich ajeeb si jang shuru ho gai
 First the Kejriwal government went to the High Court seeking authority over the Anti Corruption Bureau from the Delhi Police
 iske baad mukhya sachiv ke taur par shakuntla gamelin or pramukh sachiv anindo majumdaar kii tainaati par dilli sarkaar or up rajyapal ke bich tanatani dikhne ko mili
 Majumdar's office was locked by the government
 rajya sarkaar kaa up rajyapal se vivaad itnaa badha ki kendriya grih mantralay ko circular jari kar bataanaa padaa ki dilli purna rajya nahin he or yahaan rajyapal ke daayre main kya-kya aata he
 The comments pehali baar dilli kii sarkaar or up rajyapal ke bich itani tanatani dekhne ko mil rahi he
 Kejriwal, in his first interview after becoming Chief Minister (which he gave to NDTV), also made a lot of personal attacks on Najeeb Jung
 haalanki in muddon ko samajhadaari se baatcheet ke jariye suljhaayaa ja saktaa tha, lekin aisa prathit hota he ki kejariwal khud kii chhavi centre sarkaar se peedit mukhyamantri kii bananaa chaahate hai
 This image may benefit him and his politics, but the people of Delhi are suffering in terms of their work
 itnaa nahin, arvind kejariwal kii sarkaar ne media par ankush lagane ke liye circular jari karke bhi ek tarah kii taanaashaahee kaa sanket diya
 In such a situation, now Kejriwal government is looking to make this issue even more difficult for itself by showing its political senselessness once again about the garbage spread in Delhi
 haalanki jarurat is baat kii he ki dilli sarkaar thande dimag se kaam kar aarope-pratyarope se bachakar janata ke bich ye bharosa paidaa kare, jiske liye use prachand bahumat mila he
 By the way, in addition to political garbage, garbage and garbage are also being spread in the streets and mohallas of Delhi due to the strike of the Municipal Corporation employees
 jis dilli ko kejariwal vishwastareey city banane kaa daawa kar rahe hai, uski vyavasthaaen ab charmarati dikh rahi hai
 The latest controversy is related to big leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party
 arvind kejariwal ne jin jitendra tomars ko kanoon mantri banaaya, ve kanoon ke shikanje main hai
 Accusations of fake degrees are being exposed layer by layer of their lies
 farji degree hasil karne kaa rog nayaa nahin he, lekin aam aadmi party jis shuchita kii baat karti rahi he, use pankchar karne ke liye kaaphi he
 The allegations against Tomar were already there, but Kejriwal never heeded those charges
 jab mantri mahoday giraftaar ho gaye, party or sarkaar kii fajihat ho gai tab aam aadmi party ne tomars par jaanch bithaane kaa faisla liya
 The problems of Somnath Bharti, who was the law minister in the previous government of Aam Aadmi Party, have also increased
 unki patni ne un par gharelu hinsa ke gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 Although the question mark on the timing of the allegations of the wife definitely arises, but this does not reduce the charges against Somnath Bharti
 somnath bharti or unki patni bhi alag alag rahete hai, lekin is maamle ne bhi aam aadmi party kii chhavi ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 In both these cases of the party high command, the silence for a long time and the attempts to describe it as a conspiracy are also reducing the benefits and losses
 in do netaaon ke alaava aam aadmi ke do anya vidhayakon par halafname main farji degree dikhaane kaa aarope he
 The politics that Kejriwal has been claiming in the name of image has now come to dominate them
 vaise vivaadon kii shuruyaat to farvari main dilli kii sarkaar sanbhaalane kii baad hi shuru ho gai thi
 After coming to the government, the way Arvind Kejriwal showed the party's founding members Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav and Anand Kumar out of the party also damaged the party's image
 aam aadmi party ek chehre kii party main tabdeel hoti dikhi, jahaan haikaman kii chalati he
 The party recovered from this quarrel, before that a strange battle began between the Delhi Government and the Lieutenant Governor
 pehle kejariwal sarkaar, dilli police se anti karpshan beuro par adhikaar ke liye hoicourt gai
 After this, the deployment of Shakuntala Gamlin and Principal Secretary Anindo Majumdar as Chief Secretary was seen to escalate between the Delhi Government and the Deputy Governor
 majumdaar ke daftar main sarkaar kii taraf se taala lagava diya gaya
 The state government's dispute with the Deputy Governor increased so much that the Union Home Ministry had to issue a circular telling that Delhi is not a full state and what comes under the Governor's purview
 tippaniyan For the first time, there is so much tension between the Government of Delhi and the Deputy Governor
 kejariwal ne mukhyamantri banane ke baad die apane pehle saakshaatkaar main (jo unhone enditivi ko diya tha) main najeeb jang par kaaphi vyaktigat hamale bhi kiye
 Though these issues could be resolved through negotiation intelligently, it appears that Kejriwal wants to create an image of himself suffering from the central government
 is chhavi se unhen or unki raajnneeti ko phayda bhale ho, lekin dilli kii janata ko kaamkaaj ke lihaaj se nuksaan uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 Not only this, the government of Arvind Kejriwal also issued a circular to curb the media, indicating a kind of dictatorship
 aise main ab dilli main faile kooday ko lekar ek baar phir kya kejariwal sarkaar apni raajnneetik naasamajh kaa parichay dekar is masale ko bhi apane liye nai mushkil banaati dikh rahi he
 However, the need is that the Delhi government should work with a cold head and avoid charges and counter-allegations to create this trust among the public, for which it has got a strong majority

 The comments pehali baar dilli kii sarkaar or up rajyapal ke bich itani tanatani dekhne ko mil rahi he
 Kejriwal, in his first interview after becoming Chief Minister (which he gave to NDTV), also made a lot of personal attacks on Najeeb Jung

 For the first time, there is so much tension between the Government of Delhi and the Deputy Governor
 kejariwal ne mukhyamantri banane ke baad die apane pehle saakshaatkaar main (jo unhone enditivi ko diya tha) main najeeb jang par kaaphi vyaktigat hamale bhi kiye
 Though these issues could be resolved through negotiation intelligently, it appears that Kejriwal wants to create an image of himself suffering from the central government
 is chhavi se unhen or unki raajnneeti ko phayda bhale ho, lekin dilli kii janata ko kaamkaaj ke lihaaj se nuksaan uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 Not only this, the government of Arvind Kejriwal also issued a circular to curb the media, indicating a kind of dictatorship
 aise main ab dilli main faile kooday ko lekar ek baar phir kya kejariwal sarkaar apni raajnneetik naasamajh kaa parichay dekar is masale ko bhi apane liye nai mushkil banaati dikh rahi he
 However, the need is that the Delhi government should work with a cold head and avoid charges and counter-allegations to create this trust among the public, for which it has got a strong majority
 itnaa nahin, arvind kejariwal kii sarkaar ne media par ankush lagane ke liye circular jari karke bhi ek tarah kii taanaashaahee kaa sanket diya

 Naresh Aggarwal of Samajwadi Party has now become Bharatiya Janata Party
 naresh agarwal apane siyaasi safar main ek do nahin balki chaar raajnneetik dalon main rahe hai
 After starting politics from the Congress, he formed the democratic Congress and joined the BJP through the SP, BSP
 naresh agarwal aise netaaon main hai do pichley do dashak se bina satta ke nahin rahe hai
 Naresh Agarwal belonged to Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party before Mulayam Singh's SP and before that he continued to be an MLA on a Congress ticket
 kul milakar naresh agarwal kii raajnneetik pari kaaphi lambii rahi he
 He became a first-time MLA on Congress ticket in 1980
 iske baad se unhone palatakar nahin dekha or kai baar sapa ke tikat par vidhayak bane
 Not only this, he contested the Lok Sabha elections in 2009 from Farrukhabad parliamentary seat on BSP ticket, but he could not win
 jiske baad 2010 main mayawati ne unhen rajyasabha kaa tohfa de diya
 Explain that in 1997 Naresh Aggarwal broke the Congress Party and formed the Democratic Congress
 wo soobe main kalyaan singh kii sarkaar ko samarthan dekar bijepi main cabinet mantri bane
 He was then a minister in the government headed by Kalyan Singh and Rajnath Singh
 iske baad 2003 main mulaayam singh yadav ke netritv main sarkaar bani to usamen bhi cabinet kaa hissaa rahe
 When Mulayam Singh retired from power in UP in 2007, he joined the ruling BSP of the state
 mayawati ne unhen loksabhaa chunaav ladaaya or rajyasabha bheja
 Despite this, he could not live together and became SP before the 2012 assembly elections
 haal main sapa kii taraf se rajyasabha saansad the
 But this time Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party refused to make him a Rajya Sabha member, then he joined BJP with his Lash Lashkar
 ye he raajnneetik itihaas68 saal ke naresh agarwal upi ke hardoi ke rahane vaale hai or kareeb chaar dashak se raajnneeti main sakriy hai
 There have been mlas from different parties seven times
 -1980 main pehali baar congress ke tikat par hardoi se vidhayak chune gaye
 - Elected as an independent candidate in 1989 and won
 -iske baad phir se unhone congress main vaapasi kar lee or 1991, 1993 or 1996 kaa vidhansabha chunaav congress ke tikat par ladaa or chunaav jeet gaye
 In 1997, he split from this Congress party and formed the All India Democratic Congress Party and was the Energy Minister in the BJP government from 1997 to 2001

 He was the Minister of Tourism from 2003 to 2004 in Mulayam Singh Yadav's government
 -2007 kaa vidhansabha chunaav bhi unhone samaajawaadee party ke tikat par hi ladaa or jeet hasil kii, lekin soobe main bahujan samaaj party kii sarkaar ai or mayawati mukhyamantri baniin
 Naresh Agarwal left SP and joined Mayawati as soon as BSP came to power
 unhone 2008 main basapa jwine kii
 He stayed with Mayawati for three years
 -2012 ke upi vidhansabha chunaav se pehle unhone mayawati kaa bhi saath chhod diya or phir se sapa main chale gaye
 Actually, he was seeking tickets for his son Nitin Aggarwal, but the BSP did not give it, due to which he left with the SP
 philhal, naresh agarwal ko bijepi ne unhen sharan di he
 However, the controversy has also started as soon as he goes to BJP
 unhone jaya bachchan ko lekar jo bayaan uski party ke andar hi aalochana hone lagi
 In such a situation, questions have also arisen about how long Naresh Aggarwal's innings can last

 This is the journey of poor girl Reshma to become Sensational Star Silk and then her downfall

 However, the story of director Milan Luthria's film is not extraditional
 naa isamen dheron tivest or turn hai
 But Rajat Arora's explosive dialogue will make you clap

 'life has got one, so why think twice
 'chaar din se chini kha rahi hum sar, namakeen kaise lagungi

 Throughout the film, every character has committed to give a smashing dialogue to the other character
 silk kii bold persenelity ko dekhte hue kai dabl mining dialog hai or shuruyaat main kuch to itane bhadde bhi hai ki lagata he


kaanon ke parade fat jaaenge
 But gradually it is revealed that the film is not a chip, but rather, the compulsion of Silk hides his pain, exploitation and double-standard to establish an adult film star
 silk ke kirdaar se aapako sahanubhuti ho jaaegi
 Vidya Balan has a great performance
 yah role aasaan nahin tha jisamen jaan daalane ke liye vidya ko shame kii kai hadein paar kerani padi
 But why is there no accent of South in Silk's Hindi? Silk has a dialog
 filmein teen vajah se chalati hai-intertenment, inttenment intertenment
 This film too has a lot of entertainment for the adults

 This is the third film to be produced under the direction of Reema Kagti

 In a small town here, people celebrating the new year were making fireworks at midnight, when they saw something else falling with coals from the sky
 dekhne par pataa chalaa ki hajaaron parinde jameen par gir rahe the
 After this, the birds with red wings started appearing everywhere
 kisi kii chat par to kisi ke angan main, kisi kii gaadi par to kisi kii balakani main
 Bibi town with a population of five thousand was surrounded by birds all over
 ek vanyajeev adhikari robi king ne bataaya, galiyon, galiyaaron, sadakon or kheton main har taraf panchi gire pade the
 In total, more than three thousand birds fell on the streets
 ab vaigyanik yah pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahe hai ki yah parinde kharaab mausam, aatishbaajee yaa jehar ke asar ke kaaran gire athwa dishabhram ke kaaran panchhiyon kaa koi puraa samooh neeche gir gaya

 is asaadhaaran ghatana ne ilaake ke logon ko hairaan kar diya or vah shampen kii bottlen kholane kii bajaay parindon kii girane kii vajah poochhate najar aae
 Some called the police and informed them
 kshetra kii ek pramukh pakshi vigyaani karen rove kaa kahana he, hamaare paas or bhi bahut se sawaal hai
 There is strong evidence that many times a large flock of birds wanders off the path and falls to the ground while flying

 There is a possibility that this huge flock of birds would be sleeping on a tree and at the same time a storm like a washing machine rose and he then slammed the birds on the ground after raising them high in the air

 asal jindagi main hamaare sainikon ko koi doosraa mauka yaa ritek nahin miltaa
 But during the shooting, he experienced all these things
 mauka tha jepi datta kii nai film palaton kii shooting kaa
 Dutta completed her two-month shooting schedule with Ladakh Scouts soldiers in Ladakh on 15 November
 outdoor main is tarah kii shooting kisi bhi nirmaataa ke liye aasaan nahin hoti kyonki unhen isaki taiyaari kamobesh waisi hi kerani padati he jaisi sena ko border par jane ke liye
 The heavy and state-of-the-art equipment used in the shoot along with the cast and the team of the unit is transported from Mumbai to the location and the line producers carry out the task
 datta kii film palaton kii shooting ladakh main aasaani se ho, iske liye film ke line produsar odpal dejor jorge ne puri jimmedaari mustaidi se uthaa rakhi thi
 Says George, "the Ministry of Defense is supporting the making of the 1962 indo-china war film Paltan
 is vajah se shooting ke dauraan uskaa puraa control tha
 The film uses only soldiers from Ladakh Scouts and their uniforms
 "line produsar kisi bhi film kii unit kaa vah pehla shaks hota he jo outdoor shooting kii har musiibat se produsar ko nijaat dilaataa he or jisase production house kaa sirdard aadha ho jaataa he
 He was first associated with George Dutta during the production of LOC Kargil
 ab datta ko jab bhi ladakh main apni film kii shooting kerani hoti he to ve jorge ko yaad karte hai
 George believes that the Defense Ministry's stance on war films is very positive
 jorge ne ab tak 20 se zyada filmon kii shooting ke dauraan line produsar kaa jimmaa sambhala he
 These include films such as Rajkumar Hirani's Three Idiots, Omprakash Mehra's Mizrya and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and Vipul Shah's Waqt apart from Dutta's films
 line produsar ke rup main unka kaam outdoor shooting ke liye kanoonee anumati, lokation khojna, jaruri upkarnon kaa intjaam, film main sthaneey logon kii jarurat puri karnaa, unit ke thaharne or khaane kii vyavastha vagairah karnaa hota he
 While doing all this, one has to keep an eye on the budget
 jaahir-si baat he ki line produsar kisi ek production house ke liye kaam nahin kar saktaa
 His work is like a freelancer
 safal line produsar vahi kehalaata he jise behtareen prabandhan ke alaava kanoonee anumati kii takneekee or loketions kii acchhee jaankaree ho
 There is not even a formal course to know the specifics of this work
 dukaan bas anubhav se hi chalati he
 In George's words, "if a producer is happy with my work, he tells other producers about me
" isi se meraa kaam chalata rahata he
 "george does not have modern equipment for shooting
 is vajah se unhen mumbai or dilli se mangana padataa he
 He says, "when a film is shot at an altitude of 11,500 feet and the temperature is below zero degree or so, the trouble increases
 cataring kii khaas vyavastha kerani padati he
 On such an occasion, the stars also say that if a strong tea is found, then life is made
 " is tarah ke outdoor shooting upakramon se paryaton ko to badhaava miltaa hi he, sthaneey logon ko bhi rojgaar miltaa he
 George also cites the problems often faced by bad weather

 purv vitt mantri arun jetali ab hamaare bich nahin hai
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has suffered a major setback with Jaitley's death as the party has lost the leader of Jaitley's stature
 2014 ke baad desh kii raajnneeti main bijepi jis tarah se frontroot par ai, usamen jetali kii stritji sabase ahm rahi
 Jaitley was also the one to save Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah from every political storm
 philhal ke siyaasi daur main modi-shah kii jodi todane vaala dur-dur tak nahin he
 In such a situation, saying goodbye to Jaitley is a big loss for modi-shah with the party
 loksabhaa chunaav haar gaye the, lekin manch ke mukhar netaa the jetaliarun jetali bhale hi loksabhaa chunaav haar gaye the, hameshaa rajyasabha se chune jate the lekin party main unka kad bahut bada tha
 He used to keep the party's policies and ideology out of any platform
 2014 main modi lahar ke baavjood loksabhaa chunaav haarane ke baad bhi jetali ko vitt mantralay jaisaa vibhaag mila
 The party will continue to redeem the work they have done
 notebandi or jiesti kaa faisla jetali ke vitt mantri rahete hue hi liya gaya tha
 Jaitley will be remembered whenever these two decisions are discussed
 sankat main diya modi-shah kaa sagarun jetali ne pradhanmantri narendra modi or grahamantri amit shah kaa tab saath diya jab unhen gujarat se baahar kar diya gaya tha
 During this, Amit Shah was often seen with Jaitley
 gujarat dangon ke baad tatkaaleen siem narendra modi kii kanoonee dikkatein dur karne kii jimmedaari bhi jetali ne hi sanbhali thi
 In the party too, there were sharp attacks against Modi, during that time Jaitley also supported Modi
 modi ko 2014 main bhaajapa ke pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaae jane ko lekar jetali ne hi party ke bade-bade diggajon ko manaaya tha
 For this, Jaitley worked to bring Rajnath Singh, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Nitin Gadkari together
 purv vitt mantri arun jetali kaa nidhan, yahaan den shradhanjalitin talaak par khulkar saamne aae the jetalithin talaak maamle kii pahal karne vaale arun jetali hi the
 The position of the government on this big issue was made clear by Jaitley
 modi sarkaar pehali baar satta main aane ke baad se hi teen talaak bill ko paarit karaane kii koshish main juty thi
 The bill was also passed by the Lok Sabha on 30 July 2019 after the Rajya Sabha
 bijepi ke brain maane jate thevajpeyi sarkaar main arun jetali ko kanoon evam nyaay, soochna evam prasaaran or vinievesh mantralay main rajya mantri banaaya gaya tha
 Jaitley was one of the most trusted people of Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 us daur main arun jetali or anant kumaar ko hi bijepi kaa brain mana jaataa tha
 However, now the party does not have both leaders

 After the order to withdraw the dismissal, Matuknath broke his fast since Monday
 unki premika juli ne unhen zeus pilaakar unka anshan tudvaya
 After breaking the fast, Matuknath, popularly known as 'love Guru', said that he has got justice after a long time and this is the victory of democracy

 He was subsequently dismissed from service on 20 July 2009

 Significantly, after the love affair with his disciple Julie became common, Matuknath taught the students the lesson of sitting in the college

 baraak obamaki patni mishael obama mangalvaar ko saudi arab pahunchi, lekin vah apane is trip se bahut khush nahin hai
 Actually, many officers there did not shake hands with him

 Not only this, the news is also news channels showed Michelle blurring on TV, because her head was not covered
 haalanki tivi channelon ne is baat se inkaar kiya he or kaha he ki viral tasviren galat hai
 Report by Bloomberg View's Josh Rogin that Saudi TV "blurred" image of First Lady Michelle Obama is FALSE
 Should check facts, not Facebook— Saudi Embassy (@saudiembassyusa)january 27, 2015mishael obama ne jab dilli ke palam airport se udaan bhari thi to unhone ghutanon tak lambii ek dress pahani thi, lekin jab vah saudi pahunchi to unhone pant, top or lanbaa floral jacket pahana tha
 Because Michelle had not covered her head, the controversy started from there and suddenly a lot of tweets started on Twitter and people expressed their displeasure
 baraak or mishael obama saudi ke raja abdulla kii maut par afsos karne vahaan pahunche the
 It is clearly visible in the video being shared on the social networking site that Michelle Obama has been blurred and hidden, but TV channels are saying it wrong
 Contrary to what you might have read elsewhere, Michelle Obama was not blurred out on Saudi televisionhttp: / / t

 66-year-old Bhupinder Singh Hooda has emerged as the most influential Chief Minister of the Congress
 lekin sirf gandhi parivaar ke kareebi hone kii vajah se hi nahin, balki haryana ke ekmaatr 'prakritik sansaadhan’ (dilli se sata beshkeemtee bhoomi kshetra jisaki maang kabhi khatm nahin hoti) ke kushal dohan se aprihaary ho gaye hai
 Hooda, who started advocating in his hometown Rohtak in the mid-seventies, made a sudden entry into politics and worked quietly behind the scenes
 raajnneeti kii raah main dhire-dhire bad rahe unke kadamon par chand logon kaa hi dhyaan gaya tha
 He says his entry into politics in 1982 was a family decision
 unheen ke shabdon main, ''ghar par ek purnakalik raajnneetijna hameshaa se maujuud tha
 First, my grandfather Chaudhary Matu Ram and then my father Chaudhary Ranbir Singh
 ”kariyar ke is kadam ne safalataa ke daravaaje khol die
 In March 2005, Sonia rejected Hooda's loyalty by dismissing Bhajanlal, who had won a landslide victory for the Congress in the state and made him the Chief Minister of Haryana
 uske baad se in aath-nau varshon main hooda ne loksabhaa main lagaataar chaar kaarykaal ke dauraan sikhi gai raajnneeti kii paini dhar kaa istemaal kar apane rajya main virodhiyon ko hairaan karte hue nae avasaron kaa bharpoor phayda uthaaya or akhil bhartiya congress cameti main apana samarthan bhi jamaaye rakhaa
 On the first floor of Haryana Bhawan on Copernicus Marg, Delhi, the grand room of the Chief Minister looks like a beautiful combination of a corporate headquarters and political office
 siem sahab se do-dhai minute kii mulaakaat ke liye intjaar kar rahe logon main prashasnic adhikariyon, khaadi main saje netaaon se lekar bijness agxcutive or apane saathiyon ke saath baitha builder bhi najar aata he
 Meanwhile, Hooda sits in the grand conference room from his room to settle some 'urgent' meetings and finally comes out
 sabhi khadey ho jate hai
 Hooda has a smile on his face
 jaahir he ve haal ke aaropon se bephikr hai ki bhoomi ke sandigdh lenden main shaamil sonia gandhi ke damaad robert wadra or badi nirmaan companiyon ko galat tareeke se phayda pahunchaaya
 "this (vadra-storm of allegations raised by IAS officer Ashok Khemka's report on the DLF controversial deal and other land scams) is sheer nonsense," he says
 ”ve jor dekar kehete hai ki 2005 main unke mukhyamantri banane ke baad se developers ko ''ek bhi inch jameen” sidhe nahin di gai he
 While approving agricultural land for commercial and residential projects, the Land License Policy of 1975 was followed
 ve kehete hai ki wadra—dlef saude sahit jile ke anya sabhi bhoomi saudon kii jaanch kii maang kar rahe gudgaanv ke saansad raav inderjeet singh jaise unke rajnatik pratidwandviyon ko bhi is niti se phayda hua he
 In his words, "inderjeet himself has got a license for 83 acres of land
 ”inderjeet yah kehete hue ki ve or vivaadon main nahin funsana chaahate, koi bhi pratikriya dene se manaa kar rahe hai
 It is being said that he has been warned by the Congress leadership not to criticize Hooda's policies
 hooda ne behichak mana he ki unki sarkaar license dene main bahut udaar rahi he
 He says, "there is no natural resource in Haryana, but it benefits the most because its border is adjacent to Delhi on three sides
" isse haryana ke logon ko apni jameen kii behatar keemat mil jaati he or sarkaar ko niveshkon ko lubhaane kaa jariya mil jaataa he
 "but consider this: since 1981, governments in Haryana have 30,418
 65 acre bhoomi ke liye license diya
 Of this, 22,000 acres of land went in favor of the builders
 march, 2005 ke baad se to hooda kii dekharekh main kathith taur par builder saathiyon yaa wadra jaise khaas doston ke jhole main yah jameen gai
 Data from the state's Town and Country Planning Department showed that Hooda has 2,732 every year
 16 acre krishi bhoomi ko comshartial or awasaiya istemaal ke liye manjuuri dete rahe hai
 These six previous chief ministers — Devi Lal, Bhajan Lal, Bansi Lal; 356 to be given during the tenures of Interim Chief Ministers Hukum Singh and Banarsi Das Gupta and Omprakash Chautala
 72 acre jameen ke mukaable aath guna adhik he
 They justify this criticism as unfair
 ''maine kisaanon kii jameen ko aarthik mulya dilvaaya he
 “his government's decision to fix floor rates has led to a spurt in land prices
 ''chautaala ke kaarykaal (2005 tak) ke dauraan kisaanon ko unki prati acre jameen par die jane vaale 1 lakh ru
 As against Rs 1 crore per acre
 dilava sakaa
 "hooda, while referring to the compensation paid for the 135 km kundli-manesar-palwal express-way, understands that the Chautala government has acquired Rs 160 crore
 lagaai thi, jabaki ''hamane jameen ke maalikon ko 650 karod ru
 Get it done
 ”hooda kaa kahana he ki floor dar tay karne se jameen ke vaise tukdon ko bhi phayda pahunchaa he jo commercial yaa awasaiya drushti se ahm jagahon par nahin hai
 Pointing to the construction projects being carried out in "untouched areas" like Panchkula, Ambala, Assandh, Rewari, Bahadurgarh, Bhiwani, Kurukshetra, Kaithal, Karnal, Palwal, Sirsa and Yamunanagar, he says that "about 13,000 outside Gurgaon" Acres of land have been licensed
 ”aatmasantosh se chhalakate chehre ke saath ve kehete hai, ''pichley aath-nau varshon main haryana main dilli kii tulana main zyada teji se shaharikaran hua he
 "but both his rivals and allies believe that while the extremely lucrative land licensing policy has benefited almost all the people associated with the land, the Chief Minister of Haryana has benefitted more than any other Chief Minister
 isaki choti-si baangi november, 2012 main surajkund main yojit congress kaaryakarini samiti kii baithak ke dauraan hooda kii bhavy mejabani main dikhi
 This was an opportunity for which Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had sacrificed his life
 sonia gandhi ke rajnatik sachiv ahamed patel ne to jaipur main baithak yojit karne kii manjuuri bhi de di thi
 Hooda cited Haryana as being close to Delhi, calling it a better option
 andruni sutron ke anusaar, hooda kii dhan jutaney kii kaabiliyat ne unhen congress netritv kii ankhon kaa tara bana rakhaa he
 During his tenure as Chief Minister, he has become closer to the Gandhi family
 hooda ke aatmavishvaas or rasookh ko badhate dekhne vaale ek varisht iees adhikari ke mutabik, ''jahaan tak main jaanata hum, ve akele aise congress netaa hai jo rahul gandhi ko bagaiyr ji lagaae sambodhit kar sakate hai
 There was no doubt in Hooda's mind about Hooda's power when, in June, in the reshuffle of the Union Cabinet, he dashed the plans of his rival Birender Singh to become cabinet minister in Haryana Congress
 haalanki ve jor dekar kehete hai, ''uske peeche main nahin tha
 i never do such dirty politics
 ” lekin unke virdohi kehete hai ki hooda aise vyakti hai jo tab tak chaiyn nahin lete, jab tak virodhiyon ke siyaasi taabut main antim keel na thok den
 Those who have access to his house say that Hooda trusts only a few special people and that he has a few leaders, officials, businessmen and some of his friends from Rohtak
 unke ek sahyogi bataate hai, aise logon main udyogpati-netaa or purv kendriya mantri vinod sharma kaa sthaan sabase upar he, jinhen hooda ''naa nahin kah sakate”
 Sharma is still his friend and political advisor
 sonia gandhi kii tarah hooda bhi vafadari kaa sila dene main yakeen karte hai
 After retiring his trusted officers, he has been awarded important positions
 masalan, rajya ke mukhya sachiv pi
 K
 choudhary ko unhone asaamaanya tareeke se chah maheene kaa seva vistaar de diya
 Hooda's Principal Secretary Chhatar Singh is also on service extension and after that he will become a member of UPSC
 kunjpura sainik skool ke dinon se tennis khilne main dilchaspee rakhane vaale hooda kehete hai ki puure din main vah samay unke liye sabase acha hota he, jab chandigarh ke mukhyamantri nivas main ghaas ke maidan par yaa phir dilli ke gymkhana club main purv davis cap khilaadi jayadeep mukherjee ke saath tennis khel rahe hote hai
 They regularly play tennis for an hour
