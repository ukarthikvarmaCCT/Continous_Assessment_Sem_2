 aatankwaad or mahangaai kaa dansh jhel rahaa padosi desh pakistan aajkal ek nae dushman se jujh rahaa he
 Health agencies in Pakistan are surprised to see the increasing number of HIV positive patients
 sindh praant main echivi positive marijon kii sankhya bekaabu si ho gai he
 According to the latest data, 700 people have been found to be HIV positive in the cities of Larkana and Ratodero in Sindh province
 hairaan karne vaali baat yah he ki 700 echivi positive marijon main 576 bachche hi hai
 Its opinion is that this figure can increase even more
 itani badi sankhya main echivi marijon ko dekhakar duniya kii swasthya agenciyaan bhi khaufjada hai
 Institutions like WHO, UNICEF and UNAIDS are sending their representatives to Pakistan
 in sansthaaon ke pratinidhi karachi main aa rahe hai, taaki echivi ke prasar kii mul vajah pataa lagaai ja sake
 International experts coming to Karachi include officials of World Health Organization, Center for Disease Control, UNICEF, NADS
 ek adhikari ne bataaya ki vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke health immergency and risk assesament ke diarector dow oliver morgan ke netritv main 12 export kii ek team karachi pahunch chuki he
 According to the report, reuse of injected syringes, lack of equipment for blood transfusion is the main reason for the spread of HIV in Larkana and Ratodero
 idar rajya kii swasthya agenciyon ne jholachhap doctoron ke khilaaf karrwai sharu kar di he, agenciyon ko shaq he ki ye kathith doctor paise bachaane ke chakkar main syringe ko dobaaraa istemaal karte hai
 However, other agencies are not satisfied with this move of the Government of Pakistan
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke ek adhikari ne kaha ki 700 echivi positive cese main 576 bachche hai, inaki umr 2 se 15 saal ke bich he
 56 percent of these children are between 2 and 5 years old
 jabaki 18 pratishat bacchon kii umr 6 se 15 saal he
 This shows that 75% of HIV positive children are children
 dablyuechao ke adhikariyon ke mutabik ye aankada duniya bhar ke echivi export ke liye behad chintaa kaa vishay he
 International experts are unable to understand why such a large number of children are falling victim to this disease
 sindh ke jin ilaakon main echivi kaa prasar hua he, ye kshetra karachi ke tahat aate hai
 Karachi is one of the cities in the world where the spread of HI is the fastest
 medical export kaa kahana he ki echivi sankraman ke lakshanon kaa pataa chalane main kaaphi samay lagata he, iske alaava trend doctoron kii kami, maujuuda doctoron main jaagarukta kii kami, echivi se judaa saamaajik bandhan kuch aise kaaran hai jisase ye beemaari lagaataar badhati chali ja rahi he
 Doctors are worried about how children between 2 and 5 years of age came into the grip of this disease, in other areas of Pakistan, reuse of syringes is also prevalent, but there, the spread of the disease is less

 is saal sardiyon main tip e, sabatip ech1en1 virus yaa swine flu ke kaaran bharat ke kai bhaagon main influenza main vruddhi hui
 It is the same virus that caused a worldwide pandemic in 2009
 yah 2010 main bhi failata rahaa, uske baad kuch saal tak sust rahaa or 2013 main ruk-ruk kar najar aata rahaa
 In February 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the virus to be a seasonal influenza strain
 duusare shabdon main, yah virus anya mausami flu virason (jaise e / ech3en2 yaa bi) se alag nahin he, jo influenza ke har mausam main niyamit taur par failte rahete hai
 In 2014 influenza was less active
 e / ech1en1 bahut zyada najar nahin aayaa tha
 Rather since 2011, influenza virus a / H3N2 and influenza b have been more effective
 lekin jab koi ek vishesh influenza virus lambey samay tak failaa rahata he, to adhikansh vyakti usase pratiraksha viksit kar lete hai
 After this, another seasonal strain starts infecting people
 yah chakree pattern mausami influenza kii khaasiyat he
 The main season of influenza coincides with the monsoon
 kabhi-kabhi influenza virus kii sakriyata thand ke mausam main bhi bad jaati he, jiskaa ek chota-motaa charam janvari-march main aata he
 Don't worry, Pune's National Institute of Virology has confirmed with gene sequencing that there has been no significant change in the a / H1N1 influenza virus spread this year
 maujuuda tikon se beemaari se bachaav ho janaa chahie or maujuuda antiveiral davaaiyaan (masalan, ogeltemivi) ab bhi prabhavi hai
 Most patients have only a mild fever with a cough or sore throat caused by the influenza virus (including influenza a / H1N1 strain)
 yah beemaari kuch din tak rahati he, jiske baad adhikansh rogi pareekshan yaa upachaar kii aavashyaktaa ke bina hi thik ho jate hai
 Where there is a greater risk, however, all influenza viruses, regardless of their type and subtype (influenza a / H1N1 or a / H3N2 or B), can cause serious illness in some of the higher risk groups
 zyada jokhim vaale logon main bujurg (60 varsh se upar kii umr vaale), pehle se hi khatre ke daayre main hone ke factor (masalan, dama) vaale paanch saal se kam umr ke bachche, garbhvatee mahilaayein or fefdon, gurde yaa hriday par asar daalane vaale lambey samay se chale aa rahe khatarnaak rogon se peedit log shaamil hai
 This includes people who have been diagnosed with diabetes, lack of immunity (eg, HIV infection, prolonged steroid treatment) or cancer
 agar zyada jokhim vaale rogiyon ke lakshan or sanket tej bukhaar tathaa gambhir khaansee yaa gale main kharash jaise dikhte hon, to sarkari disha nirdeshon ke anusaar unhen pareekshan kii aavashyaktaa ke bina, antiveiral dawa ke saath upachaar kii salaah di jaati he
 They may also require a course of antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections of the respiratory tract, which may be followed by influenza
 pareekshan or upachaar unke liye aavashyak hai, jinamein tej bukhaar or khaansee ke alaava shwaas maarg ke nichle bhaag main or fefdon main (viral neumonia) sankraman ke lakshan dikhte hai
 Difficulty in breathing, chest pain, drowsiness, fall in blood pressure, sputum bleeding, light blueing of nails, as well as chronic disease worsening of high risk patients should be monitored
 paanch saal se kam umr ke bacchon main choti-choti saans chalanaa or saans lene main takalif, tej or lagaataar bukhaar, bhojan na karnaa or marod bhi khatre ke sanket hai
 The figures are misleading
 It is important to understand that the mortality rate that is being reported is mostly reported from the laboratory-confirmed worst affected patients who were advised to undergo the test
 ek kaalpanik chithran karen
 If 1,000 influenza cases are detected in a community, it may be that in fact only 100 may have gone to the hospital or their tests were required
 inamen se yadi beemaari ke shikaar 10 hote hai, to mrityu dar kaa pratishat 1,000 ko vibhaajak maanakar (yani 1 fisadi) nikaala janaa chahie, na ki 100 ko vibhaajak maanakar (10 fisadi) nikaala janaa chahie
 When seasonal influenza in a community has spread as widely as it has spread this year, in which a large number of people have been affected by a mild influenza-like illness, the divisive number (the number of individuals infected in the community, not just hospitals or The number of people arriving for testing in laboratories) may not be known accurately
 prayogshaala pareekshan par aadhaarit akalan gambhirtha kii atiranjana darsha saktaa he or dehshat paidaa kar saktaa he
 Take care It is important that we take simple precautions to prevent the spread of influenza
 jinhen influenza jaisi beemaari ho, unhen khaansee ke samay vaala vyavhaar karnaa chahie (jaise khansate samay ek saaf roomaal se munh ko dhaknaa) or apane haath niyamit rup se dhone chahie
 They should avoid going to public places and take a few days off from work to prevent the spread of infection
 jo log adhik jokhim vaale samoohon main hai, ve influenza kaa tikaa lagavane par vichaar kar sakate hai

 Maharashtra HSC Result Budget 2019 While presenting the Interim Budget 2019, Finance Minister Piyush Goyal has announced that 12 crore farmers will be given Rs 6000 per year
 ye raashi sidhe kisaanon ke khate main transfar kar di jaaegi
 The farmers will get this money in three installments
 is yojana kaa naam pradhanmantri kisaan sammaan yojana rakhaa gaya he
 It will be implemented from 1 December 2018
 2 hectayar khet rakhane vaale kisaan is yojana ke tahat yogya maane jaaenge
 At the same time, Piyush Goyal also said that the central government has increased the inflation rate to 4
 6 fisadi ke str par laane kaa kaam kiya he
 He said that this has brought the biggest relief to the poor people
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki purv kii sarkaron ne gramin ilaakon se sirf khokhla vaada karne kaa kaam kiya he
 But there was a lot of backlash on social media for giving Rs 6000 per year to farmers
 kai logon ne sarkaar kii is yojana ko masterstroke bataaya he, vahiin kai ne ise majaak qaraar diya he
 User @vicky_donorr asked if it was worth a vote? @ sinhapks56 wrote that the installment is speaking as if 5 lakh will be given in 3 installments
 @srikant2019 ne likhaa ki kisaan modi kii is yojana kaa laabh bhi lenge or unhen emspi nahin badhaane ke liye satta se baahar bhi kar denge
 They seem to be trying to pave over 4
 5 years of sheer neglect and disastrous policy failure
 Rs
 6000 farmer per year, instead of guaranteeing a Minimum Sale Price for their crops, is adding insult to injuryfarmers don't need charity
 They need systemic reforms

 Sheila Dixit ji made a memorable contribution in the development of Delhi
 
 
 ’ ye shabd pradhanmantri narendra modi ne dilli kii purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit ke nidhan par shanivaar ko kahe
 Not only Prime Minister Modi, many leaders including President Ram Nath Kovind, Home Minister Amit Shah and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi remembered his death for his contribution to the development of Delhi
 aise main aaie jaanate hai shila dikshit ke dilli ke vikaas ke liye uthaae gaye un paanch faislon ke bare main jin par aaj bhi charchaa hoti he
 Punjab-born Sheila Dixit raised her personality in Delhi
 uttar pradesh main apana raajnneetik kaushal majboot karne ke baad unhone rashtriya rajdhani dilli ko apni karmbhumi banaaya
 Sheila Dixit has been the Chief Minister of Delhi for three consecutive times (1998-2013)
 is daur main unhone dilli ko vikaas ke path par daudane ke liye pradesh main bijli nijeekaran, blueline bason par roak, kerosine istemaal par roak, sienji ke upyog ko badhaava dena or emsidi ko teen hisson main baantne jaise kai ahm faisle liye
 Comment here to pay tribute to Sheila Dixit, the most loved CM of Delhi, there was a time when there was a lot of power cut in Delhi
 dilliwasi isse bahut pareshaan the
 Due to the power cut, there were many difficulties in the state in front of people of every category
 chote-bade kal kaarkaanon ke saamne tab bijli katautee ek badi samasya thi
 During the summer, people were suffering from power cuts
 is samasya ko dekhte hue tatkaaleen mukhyamantri shila dikshit ne pradesh main bijli nijeekaran kaa faisla liya
 As a result, today Delhi is free from problems like power cuts
 vikaas sahi myanon tabhi samajha jaataa he jab logon ko behatar paryaavaran mili
 Sheila Dixit understood this well and she banned the use of kerosene in Delhi
 darasal us samay dilli main kerosine kaa istemaal dhadlle se hota tha
 People used kerosene in lamps, stoves, industry industries, factories and tractors
 yah shila dikshit ke kadamon kaa hi fal tha ki saal 2012-13 main rajdhani ko desh kaa pehla kerosine mukt shahar banane kaa gaurav hasil hua
 Along with this, Sheila Dixit took several steps keeping in mind these points, how to provide better traffic facilities to Delhiites, how to reduce road accidents and how to control vehicular pollution
 unhone ‘killer’ kaa darja paa chukin blue line bason ke parivahan ko band kiya
 Then there was a day when there was no news of an accident in the media from the blueline bus
 indiatode website par 25
 10
 2010 ko prakaashik ek khabar seiske liye unhone sienji or usase chalane vaali bason ko badhaava diya
 Today, most of the trains in Delhi are run by CNG
 kal kaarkaanon or udyog dhandhon main sienji kaa istemaal badha he
 This has the advantage that today diesel and petrol-run vehicles in Delhi decreased, which reduced the pollution caused by trains
 dilli ke sienji pump kii tasviir (file photo- ians)bataa den ki sienji yani compresd natural gas ek svachh eendhan he
 It burns less pollutants from kerosene, diesel and petrol
 sienji ko har myanon main ek acha eendhan bataaya jaataa he
 Another special step towards the development of Delhi is that he divided the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) into three parts
 iske vibhaajan ke peeche unki ye soch rahi thi ki dillivaasiyon ko zyada se zyada suvidhaayen mil saken
 They can get benefit of the work done by MCD properly
 haalanki us samay unke is faisle par bijepi samet tamaam vipakshi dalon ne unki aalochana bhi kii thi
 It was the result of Sheila Dixit's basic work in various areas in Delhi that even her political opponents could not disagree that she was a major force behind the transformation of Delhi

 uske baad se khan 'aap' kii political acshan cameti se istipha de chuke hai, lekin ve apane bayaan par kaayam hai
 He has since been suspended from the party as Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia want to maintain confidence in trying to keep the party united
 vishwaas ko rajasthan kaa prabhaar bhi diya gaya
 This indicated that the party is preparing for the 2018 elections as morale has plummeted in the party

 party ke bhitari sutron kaa kahana he ve party ke saadhaaran netaa the, jinhen apni kaabiliyat ke kaaran nahin, balki kejariwal ke prati vafadari ke kaaran tarakkee de di gai thi
 Angry activists have long been accused of being sly and even corrupt
 unka chunavi ganit bilkul moorkhtapurna thah jitna paisa, utana vot
 They were also told initially on the target of faith
 party kii bhitari kalah ne bhaajapa ko munhmaangi muraad de di he
 It has almost cleared its intention to topple the Delhi government after a landslide victory in the municipal elections
 bhaajapa ke pravaktaa sudhanshu mittal ne kaha, ''dilli kii janata ne kejariwal or 'aap' ko khaarij kar diya he
 "ashutosh says," Kejriwal will privately discuss AAP mlas, party members and try to connect with the people

 Whatever may be the reason for choosing this stronghold of his father and family, but from here, Akhilesh made it clear that if Mulayam is a father, there will be respect but he will do well in the party

 After Akhilesh's meeting, 'aaj Tak' tried to know the attitude of Mulayam on the new attitude of the people present there, then it came to know that the workers are also behind Akhilesh
 eta main maujuud kaaryakartaaon ne kaha ki vakt akhilesh kaa he to philhal sabhi unke hi saath hai
 But it is also believed that Netaji's influence is not small and no one in the party can speak against Mulayam Singh Yadav

 While the Samajwadi Party has 5 of the 6 seats, but the seat of Etah Sadar from where Akhilesh started his election campaign, the seat of Mulayam's supporters from the Lok Dal and Akhilesh's supporters are beating with the Samajwadi Party

 Due to which Mulayam was very upset but Akhilesh did not listen
 akhilesh ne na sirf joginder yadav ko tikat diya balki usee ke kshetra se chunavi abhiyaan kaa shriganesh bhi kar diya
 After the meeting till date, he spoke to Akhilesh candidate Joginder Yadav, he said that his leader is Akhilesh and people have now gone ahead by considering Akhilesh as the leader
 udhar vartmaan vidhayak ashish yadav bhale hi lokdal se lard rahe hai lekin wo mulaayam ke binar or poster ke saath apane campan main jute hai
 Making serious allegations on Ashish Akhilesh's candidate Joginder Yadav, he said that he has grabbed the lands of thousands of people
 wo na sirf ilaake ke bhu mafia hai balki unke upar gambhir aapraadhik aarope bhi he
 In fact, after this statement of Mulayam, the candidates of Samajwadi Party contested in all the 105 seats of Congress, now there is a passion in that section which belongs to Mulayam faction
 ab kai siton par mulaayam or shivpal ke log namakan kar sakate hai
 The battle of father and son has now come out of the houses and into the field
 mulaayam singh ke paas ab zyada kuch khone ko bachaa nahin he lekin dekhnaa he ki pita kaa yah baagi ruukh akhilesh yadav ko kitna nuksaan panhuchata he

 Holi is considered a festival of Hindus, but not only Hindus but people of all religions have been celebrating it with pomp
 mughalkaal main bhi mughal shaasha badi umang ke saath holi manaate the
 Historians say that Holi has been prevalent since long and it is mentioned in many places
 aaie jaanate hai pehle holi kis tarah manaai jaati thi
 
 
 What is the history of Holi: You must have heard about the story of Holika Dahan and its description is found in many religious books
 bharat main purvi bharat main yah tyohaar zyada celibratt karte hai
 This festival is also mentioned in the ancient manuscripts and texts of Puranas such as mimamsa-sutra, Katha garhya-sutra, Narada Purana, Bhavishya Purana before Jaimini
 lag gaya he phalgun kaa maheenaa, jaane dharmik or vaigyanik mahatvamugalkaal main holibharat ke anek muslim kaviyon ne apni rachanaaon main is baat kaa ullekh kiya he ki holikotsav keval hindu hi nahin musalmaan bhi manaate hai

 Delhi Congress president Ajay Maken said that the Kejriwal government should make its streak bigger
 unhen aarakshan kii bajaae aspataalon ko banavaane par dhyaan dena chahie
 Maken said there are 6 to 7 super specialty hospitals in Delhi
 inhen centre sarkaar chalaati he or lagbhag 4000 karod rupee kharch karti he
 If the center makes a reservation in its hospital, then who will be the loss? Maken said that the Delhi government says that it only has bed reserves for the people of the state
 agar centre sarkaar kehane lage ki hamaare aspataal main bed rashtriya str ke logon ke liye rigerv hai to nuksaan kiskaa hoga
 Ajay Maken said that the total number of beds in the super specialty hospitals of Delhi is around 50 thousand
 kul bed main se 10,145 bed dilli sarkaar ke hai or baaki 11,000 bed centre sarkaar ke hai
 The Delhi government is saying in 10,145 beds that we are reserving them
 vahiin agar centre sarkaar 11,000 apane bed par arakshit kar de to dilli kaa phayda hoga yaa nuksaan? yah kejariwal ko samajhnaa chahie
 Ajay Maken said that the path can be found only by increasing its line, not by erasing others
 yani aspataalon kii sankhya dilli main badhaai jaae
 Recalling 15 years of Congress rule, Maken said that when our government was in power, we built an average hospital every year, but in the Kejriwal government its pace has stopped

 In the monsoon session of Parliament, the Congress may be soft on the GST bill
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi se upi prabharee gulam nabi aaazaad kii ahm mulaakaat ke baad aise sanket saamne aae hai
 According to Priyanka Gandhi Janjankari, who attended the meeting, Priyanka Gandhi also attended this important meeting at 10 Janpath for some time

 Azad can make a statement about the party line on GST on Tuesday
 congress chaahegi sarkaar se sudhaar kii guaranteemansoon satr main mukhya vipakshi dal congresgsti bilko lekar apni mukhya maang 18 fisad tex rate par cap ko sanvaidhanik sanshodhan main rakhane par naram pad sakati he
 However, the Congress would like a guarantee on the tax rate from the government on its demands
 jiesti bill par congress kii teen badi maangencongress ne jiesti bill par apni teen maangen rakhi hai
 First, the constitutional amendment bill on GST should set the cap rate of 18 percent in the tax itself
 doosraa, jiesti vivaadon ke niptaare ke liye praadhikaran kaa gathan ho
 And third, the withdrawal of additional one percent tax on producing states
 congress kyon padi naram?congress kii in teen maangon kii vajah se jiesti bill kai sansad ke satron main paarit nahin ho sakaa
 The reason for the change in the attitude of the Congress is believed to be the defeat of the Congress in the recent elections and the weakening of the party politically in the Rajya Sabha
 kya nikal saktaa he bich kaa raastasarkaar kii taraf se jiesti par gatirodh khatm karne ke liye congress netaaon se vitt mantri arun jetali or sansadeey kaarymantri anant kumaar kaa baatcheet karnaa tay mana ja rahaa he
 Two options can be placed by the government on the first and main demand of the Congress
 yaa to jiesti rate ko bill ke sahaayak niyamon main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he yaa phirgsti rate kii simaako jiesti bill main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Kharge said - Nearly with the consent of the government, the government is hopeful that the long-standing GST bill will be passed by taking everyone's support in the monsoon session of Parliament
 loksabhaa main congress netaa mallikarjun khadge kaa is maamle par kahana he ki do maangon par to hamaare or sarkaar ke bich kareeb-kareeb sahmati ban rahi he
 Now the matter is of 18 percent cap, if we ask the government our opinion, we will tell

 Former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Babulal Gaur said, "advani has rightly said

 "how you live your life is your issue
 bas itnaa yaad rakhie ki hamaare dil or deh hamen sirf ek dfa die jate hai
 Before you understand it, your heart is dead and your body reaches the point where neither one looks at it nor wants to come towards it
 abhi agar dukh or dard he, iske saath hi anand ko mahasoos kar paaenge
 "these lines of the Oscar Award-awarded film 'call Me By Your Name' are telling a father to his son
 jab unhen ye pataa chalata ki unka betaa 'ge' arthath 'samalangik' he
 Instead of putting him in any depression, he is seen trying to recover from it
 jis pal main unka ye monolog chal rahaa hota us vakt bete ko lag rahaa hota ki usne jo kiya he usamen galati uski he
 The father, explaining the entangled relationship between body and soul, is seen appreciating the decision for him
 lekin yah to film kii baat hui
 Will a father really adopt his gay son so easily? Have we become so developed that LGBTQ i
e
 'lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Queer' community will be adopted without any prejudice? Is our society ready to give them the right to equality and respect? In these days, Section 377 of the IPC is being debated again in the court
 desh ke vibhinn NGO dhara 377 ko nirast karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 At the same time, if you listen to the proud people, a different picture emerges
 devband muslim dharmaguru nadeem ul vaajidi kaa kahana he ki, "islam dharm main to ye bilkul manaa he
 Men and women cannot marry women and the reason for this in the quran-e-karim has been given
 yah kaha gaya he ki nikaah kaa makasad insaan kii nasl badhanaa he
 The nikah is carried out to further the breed
 naslein sirf isi surat main bad sakati hai jab kisi mard kaa aurat se nikaah ho
 This purpose is not fulfilled in the case of a man being married to a man or married to a woman, and as far as we understand it is not allowed in any sky religion
 "vahiin hindu dharmaguru' jitendra sharma' ne bhi samalangik vivaah ke bare main virodh karte hue kehete hai ki samalangik vivaah ke bare main jo prastaav chal rahaa he ekadam galat he
 It is not valid, based on Hindu culture
 dhara 377 ke khatm ho jane se purush veshyavriti bhi badhegi jo samaaj ke liye sahi nahin he
 Being gay is a disease
 jiskaa ilaaj hona chahie
 "apart from 'harminder Singh' who is the general secretary of Guru Singh Sabha, he also made clear his stand that" Even if the court recognizes homosexuality, our Sikh community will not adopt any gay person
 "udhar centre ne bhi dhara 377 ko nirast karne kaa faisla court par chhod diya he
 Now first of all we need to understand that what is Section 377 of IPC? Why is it demanding to be removed? What are the problems that the LGBTQ community has to face due to its existence? Section 377 is a law made by the British
 jo 1862 main likhaa gaya tha
 Which clearly states, "section 377 is unnatural offense
 jab koi bhi swechha se prakruti ke vipareet kisi purush, mahila yaa pashu ke saath swechha se shaareerik sambandh sthapit karata he to use umr kaid kii sajaa hogi yaa phir ek avadhi, jo das saal tak badhaai ja sakati he, kii kaid hogi or use jurmaana bhi dena hoga
 The offense has been made cognizable under this section
 isamen giraftaar ke liye kisi prakaar ke warrant kii jarurat nahin hogi
 The police can arrest anyone in this case on suspicion or by citing secret information
 yah ek gairajamaanti aparaadh he
 "now the thing to note is that there is no such law in the country of the British who wrote this law
 vahaan 377 ko kanoonee taur par khaarij kar diya gaya he
 And not only in England but many other countries of the world like, Belgium, Netherlands, Canada, Spain, New Zealand, Denmark, Argentina, Sweden, Portugal, etc
, homosexuality is recognized
 yahi nahin america main to sena main samalangik sainikon kaa bhartee par lagi roak ko hataakar ise protsaahit kiya gaya he
 But in India, it is still a matter of respect, culture and prestige
 hamaara samaaj ab bhi ise ek beemaari ke taur par dekhtaa he jabaki grathon or upanishdon tak main samalangikta evam aprakritik yon sambandhon kaa zikr he
 Many scenes of homosexuality have been written in the Kamasutra written by Vatsyana years ago
 aap khujraaho kii murtiyon ko kareeb se dekhenge to paaenge kai murtiyon deviyaan hi ek duusare ke saath rati-kriya karti nazar aaengi
 While section 377 forbids association with animals, the Ashwamedha yagna had the king's patrani relationship with the horse left by the king, after which the horse, ie the horse, was killed
 to jo log iske virodh main bol rahe hai or ise bhartiya sabhyataa ke kilaaf kah rahe hai unhen apane grathon ko palatney kii darkaar he
 Homosexuality is as natural as the physical relationship between an adult man and a woman
 yah koi beemaari nahin he ki jise ilaaj dwaara thik kiya ja sake
 People who are gay or lesbian start tending towards their gender from their childhood
 iskaa koi alag yaa thos kaaran nahin he
 Nature makes some people like that, many psychiatrists have said
 haa ye or baat he ki samaaj or parivaar ke dar ke aage wo in chizon par khul kar bol nahin pate
 Many times when they dare to tell the family, then either they are taken to the doctor
 kyunki gharavaalon ko yah ek beemaari jaan padati he
 At times they face heavy family opposition
 udaarahan ke taur par ham akhilesh godi kii kahani ko lete hai, jinhone apni kahani ek angreji akhbaar se share kiya he
 Akhilesh says that he comes from a Liberal family
 unhone apane bal-bute par IIT se grajuation kiya
 But when he revealed his sexuality to the world, apart from the society, those who were studying with him also increased the distance from him
 wo itane depressd ho gaye ki unhen manochikitsk ke paas janaa padaa
 He says that he was not able to put his point properly in front of Manokitsk because he was afraid that they would also see him as a criminal
 baad main parivaar or kuch doston kii madad se wo depresan se baahar nikal paae
 This is not just a story of Akhilesh
 ye kahani lagbhag har LGBT samudaay se jude logon kii hai
 Gay, lesbian, bisexual or queer people have to face new problems every day from these people till they find jobs
 log unhen manorogi samajhate hai
 Since the Supreme Court overruled the 2009 verdict in 2013, 377 was again put on the list of criminal cases, the problems of gay people have been increasing
 isi kaaran se IIT ke 20 chaatro ne mil kar 'pravriti' naam se ek group banaaya he, jo 157 saal puraane is kanoon ke khilaaf ek petishan daayar karne vaale hai
 Debottam Saha from the same group who is doing PHD from IIT Delhi also shared his story to a daily newspaper, "he had befriended someone on the Internet
 baad main jab unhone apni sexuelti ko disclose kiya to wo shaks saaha ko blackmel karne laga
 Saha could not even go to the police for help as he is a criminal in the eyes of law
 "aisi na jane kitni kahaniyaan samalangik logon ke paas hongi
 Those who are neither listeners nor understanders
 ab vakt aa gaya he ki na sirf dhara 377 ko khatm kiya jaae balki naukari se le kar, swasth or awaas ke kshetra main LGBTQ samudaay ke logon ko samuchit adhikaar die jaaen
 These rights should be met legally with respect
 kyunki samvidhan ke anuchhed 14 or 21 ke main jin moulik adhikaron kaa zikr kiya gaya he unheen adhikaron kaa hanan 377 main ho rahaa he
 The decision of the Supreme Court is yet to come, but it can be expected that the decision will come in favor of the gay community itself
 unhen bhi haq he samaaj main sammanit zindagi jeene kaa
 a life in which he is not just a criminal or a psychopath, but a human being

 diwali ke tyohaari hafte main do badi filmein relies huin
 Golmaal Again filled with many big stars including Aamir Khan starrer Secret Superstar and Ajay Devgan
 apane-apane content ke hisaab se donon acchhee filmein hai
 However, Secret Superstar lagged far behind Golmaal in terms of box office revenue
 duniyabar main golmaal ne ab tak kareeb 154 karod se zyada kii kamai kii he
 The cost of the film is being told 80–85 crores
 is lihaaja se dekha jaae to film kii laagat or munaafe main bada antar he
 These figures are just seven days
 diwali ke ek din baad shuukravaar ko relies hui golmaal ne pehle din 30

 37, ravivaar ko 29
 09, 16 on Monday
 04, mangalvaar ko 13
 25, and 10 on Wednesday
 05 karod kii kamai kii
 According to trade analyst Taran Adarsh in the Indian market, the film grossed 126 in the Indian market
 94 karod rupee he
 The film grossed over 27 crores in the overseas market till Wednesday
 box offis main aise pichad gai sikret superstarhalanki behatar kahani or abhinay se saji aamir khan -jaayra wasim kii film logon ko jamkar prashansa mili, lekin vah kamai karne main thodi kamjor sabit hui
 The Secret Superstar took four days to earn as much as Aamir's previous film Dangal earned (30 crore) on Opening Day
 yah pichley kuch saalon main aamir ke filmon kii sabase kharaab opening he
 Even Dhobi Ghat released First Day Collection 2 in 2011
 78 karod rupee ke kareeb tha
 Secret Superstar released on 1100 screens in India on Diwali on Thursday 4
 80, shuukravaar 9

 Thus the film grossed 34 in the Indian market
 36 karod kaa collection kiya
 In Overseas too, the film till Monday had around 20
 22 karod rupee tak kaa collection kiya
 The budget of the film is said to be between 40-50 crores
 haalanki mekars ne is bare main kuch khulaasa nahin kiya he
 Do not show secret superstars to children? The mistakes that Aamir did not expect, the failure due to this? This time Aamir missed many places
 hakeekat main ye film 15 saal kii insiya or gharelu hinsa kii shikaar uski maa najma ke sangharsh kii kahani he
 But the campaign only featured Insia's story
 kuch kaa maananaa he ki marketing ke dauraan insiya kii maa kii kahani ko chhipaana film ke liye ghaatak sabit hua
 Confusion was created among the people about the story
 diwali ko relies hona bhi film ke kaarobaar par asar daalane vaala sabit hua
 Review: Secret Superstar is a director's film, after Dangal, it is interesting to see Aamir that in the week of Diwali, people have to watch a light-hearted entertaining film
 sikret superstar kaa is hafte relies hona galat nahin tha, golmaal agen jaisi masala se bharpoor film se ise nuksaan ho gaya
 Secret superstars also got less screens because of the breakup
 box offis par film ke kamjor hone kii ek badi vajah yah bhi he ki aamir kaa charitra utana lanbaa nahin he jitna hona chahie tha
 Zaira has done her part better than she expected, but Aamir's presence in the film is the most entertaining
 kahani ko nuksaan pahunchaae bina shakti kumaar ke kairactor kaa lanbaa hona kamai ke lihaaj se film ko phayda pahunchaa saktaa tha
