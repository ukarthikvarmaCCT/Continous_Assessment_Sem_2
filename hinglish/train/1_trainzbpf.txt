 In a lecture in Stockholm on May 26, 1921, Tagore said, 'I believe that the suffering we are suffering today is due to the crisis of oblivion, solitude, because we have the opportunity to welcome humanity and We have missed sharing with the world the best thing that is available with us, the soul of India has always proclaimed the ideal of unity, this ideal of unity can be extended to any object, to any caste

 JDU rebel leader Sharad Yadav was given a memorandum by the JDU Parliamentary Party leader RCP Singh and General Secretary Sanjay Jha to the Chairman Venkaiah Naidu in the Rajya Sabha recently
 haalanki, is maamle main faisla itnaa aasaan nahin, party par daawey ke maamle par abhi chunaav ayog kaa faisla aana he uske baad hi rajyasabha sabhapati par faisla aa sakegaa
 It was only after this move by Nitish Kumar that the disgruntled faction of JDU said that the matter is already with the Election Commission as to who has the right over the party
 sharad yadav gut kaa yaa phir nitish gut kaa
 In such a situation, only after the matter is resolved by the Election Commission, the Vice President (chairman of Rajya Sabha) can discuss the memorandum given by the Nitish faction for discussion
 ek angreji akhbaar main chhapi khabar ke mutabik sharad yadav ke sahyogi javed raja ne kaha ki rajyasabha ke sabhapati kosharad yadav ko aayogyathhraaye jane ke liye nitish gut kii taraf se jo koshish ho rahi hai ham spasht kar dena chaahate hai ki ye maamla chunaav ayog ke saamne he
 The Sharad faction claimed its claim on the party and the mark before the Election Commission on 25 August

 Anna was not thinking that there will be honest people in the political party formed under his patronage, what is the guarantee? In fact, he could never believe that he or any of his disciples would be able to escape the mess of politics which he has been talking about
 lekin anna ko is ladaai kaa cheharaa banane vaale kejariwal ke paas itnaa vakt nahin tha ki ve is buudhe gandhivadi kii manthar chaal se kadam taal kar saken

 us drishy ko dekhakar main un naujavaanon par bada garv mahasoos kar rahaa tha or anubhav kar rahaa tha ki desh main parivartan kaa samay aa gaya he

 Anna not only announced to separate himself from any political party, but also said that his picture should not be used by Arvind Kejriwal's team
 anna ne kaha ki unhen fasebuk or internet par raajnneetik dal banane ke liye kiye gaye surveykshanon par bharosa nahin he
 They do not consider it public opinion
 anna ne ek tarah se soshal media kii us jameen ko hi khokhla ghoshit kar diya jis par ab tak unka andolan khadaa tha
 The limit was reached when Anna met Baba Ramdev secretly in the presence of General VK Singh in Delhi that night

 In fact, the government has already denotified all the highways passing through Jaipur and made it into an urban road
 jaipur se teen haive guzarate hai neshnal haive-8, neshnal haive-11 or neshnal haive-13
 On top of these three, where the big and five star hotels are built in the urban area, already the government has denotified the highway and made it an urban road

 The highest five-star and three-star hotels are on NH-8 in delhi-gurgaon-jaipur
 lekin aabkaari vibhaag kaa kahana he ki zyaadaatar hotalon or baar par supreme court ke niyam kaa asar nahin padegaa kyonki ye ilaaka jaipur nagar nigam kaa he jahaan par jansankhya 20,000 se kam he
 That is, liquor can be sold or served 220 meters away at these places
 jaipur ke aabkaari ayukta opi yadav kaa kahana he kienech-8 par bahut kam asar padegakhyonki in ilaakon kii aabaadi 20,000 se kam he
 The hotels and bars which are coming in the range of 220 meters, are taking the highway and taking their bar to the back
 haalanki opi yadav kaa kahana he ki kanoonee vibhaag ne is maamle par unhen baat karne se manaa kiya he
 Therefore, in this case one can say that the decision of the Supreme Court will be implemented

 lekin sutron ke mutabik aabkaari vibhaag apane kanoon vibhaag se supreme court ke faisle kaa adhyayan karvaa rahaa he jo ye batayega ki kis tarah se kamai par kam se kam asar pade or jaruri hone par sharaab dukaanon ko kahaan shift kiya ja sake
 There are agitations everywhere in Rajasthan against the sale of liquor and opening of new shops
 sarkaar ke saamne samasya ye he ki usne sharaab kii dukaanon kaa aavanton kar diya he or moti kamai bhi kii he lekin sharaab kii dukaanon ke virodh main baithi janata ko bhi naaraaz nahin karnaa chaahati he
 Therefore, there is conflict between the public and liquor contractors on the roads

 ) During the election campaign in UP, Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently targeted the Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati
 unhone kaha tha ki bispi ab 'bahanji sampatti party' ho gai he
 The Prime Minister was perhaps referring to the recent media reports quoting the Income Tax Department claiming that more than Rs 100 crore was deposited in BSP accounts immediately after demonetisation
 mayawati ne iskaa karaara jawaab diya or apane ek bhaashan main unhone kaha ki jab notebandi lagu hui tab bispi kii chanda ikattha karne kii prakriya jari thi or wo 100 karod rupee party ke lakhon samarthakon dwaara die gaye chote daan se mili, inamen se kuch log to bilkul haashie par hai
 But the Income Tax Department is believed to have questioned the source of bsp's money in the investigation
 jahaan ek ore sabhi raajnneetik dal praapt dhan kaa 60-70 fisadi hissaa hi agyaat strot se mila darshaate hai (yani 2 xxrep 4 0 se kam kaa chanda jo ki chhot ke daayre main aata he), jabaki bispi apane 100 fisadi praapt dhan ko agyaat strot se mila bataati he
 And it is not a small amount, according to the party, between 2004 and 2015, it received a donation of Rs 760 crore, out of which not a single rupee was received through check
 isse is ashanka ko bal mila ki bispi ko mili ye paise agar sabhi nahin, to kuch siten chunaav main ummidavaaron ko bechi gayi
 During a rally at Mayawati in Gonda in eastern Uttar Pradesh, we met some candidates from the region, almost all of whom are alleged to have given Rs 2 to 4 crores for tickets
 lekin gonda sadar se bispi ummidavaar jaleel khan mayawati ke daavon kaa samarthan karte hue kehete hai ki duusari partiyaan hai jo ghabaraakar prayek chunaav kshetra main 10-20 karod rupee baant rahi hai
 And the truth is as complicated as ever
 raily ke kuch ghante pehle hamane gonda ke narora arjuna gaanv kaa daura kiya jahaan zyaadaatar dalit rahete hai
 People here claim that they have given money for local welfare works and not to the party
 narora arjuna gaanv ke govind gautam kehete hai, 'hamane kabhi bhi kisi party ko chanda nahin diya
 'but after the instigation of a local BSP worker, he believes that some of them have donated to the party
 gautam kehete hai ki unhone chamahi yogadan ke rup main 500 rupee die hai jisaki unhen raseed bhi mili he
 BSP worker Sangam Das Bharti said that he pays Rs 5100 to the party every 6 months
 vah kehete hai, ise aise samajhie ki jis party se dhani vyapaaree log kinaaraa kiye rahete hai, usne is tarah taiyaari kii he
 It is clear from these facts that some part of the money received by the BSP comes only through small donations, but to what extent, it is impossible to guess
 tippaniyan In her previous affidavit to the Rajya Sabha, Mayawati had declared assets worth over Rs 100 crore, raising questions as to whether the money received from her poor supporters did not work to make the BSP supremo rich
 lekin yahaan gaanv main, lagata nahin ki log koi parvaah karte hai
 Gautam said, 'mayawati is a great support for all of us
 agar vah yahaan hai to ham jinda rah sakate hai, nahin to log hamen jeene nahin denge

 purvi uttar pradesh ke gonda main mayawati kii ek raily ke dauraan hamaari mulaakaat is kshetra ke kuch ummidavaaron se hui, unamem se kareeb sabhi par yah aarope he ki unhone tikat ke liye 2 se lekar 4 karod rupee tak die hai
 But BSP candidate from Gonda Sadar supports Jalil Khan Mayawati's claims that there are other parties who are panicking and distributing Rs 10-20 crore in each constituency
 or sachai hameshaa kii tarah hi jatil he
 a few hours before the rally, we visited Narora Arjun village in Gonda, where most Dalits live
 yahaan log daawa karte hai ki unhone sthaneey kalyankari kaaryon ke liye paise die hai na ki party ko
 Govind Gautam of Narora Arjun village says, 'we never donated to any party
 ' lekin ek sthaneey bispi kaaryakarta ke uksaane ke baad wo maanate hai ki unamem se kuch ne party ko chanda diya he
 Gautam says that he has given Rs 500 as half-yearly contribution, which he has also received a receipt
 bispi ke kaaryakarta sangam das bharti ne bataaya ki vah har 6 maheene main 5100 rupee party ko dete hai
 He says, consider it as such that the party from which the rich business people keep away, has prepared in this way
 in baton se spasht he ki bispi ko praapt dhan kaa kuch hissaa vaaki chote daan ke jariye hi aata he, lekin kis had tak, ye andaja laga paanaa asambhav he
 The comments rajyasabha ke liye die gaye apane pichley halafname main mayawati ne 100 karod rupee se zyada kii sampatti ghoshit kii thi, jisase sawaal uthe the ki unke garib samarthakon se mila paisa basapa supremeo ko amir banane ke kaam to nahin aayaa
 But here in the village, people don't seem to care
 gautam ne kaha, 'mayawati ham sab ke liye bada sahaara hai

 Gautam says that he has given Rs 500 as half-yearly contribution, which he has also received a receipt
 bispi ke kaaryakarta sangam das bharti ne bataaya ki vah har 6 maheene main 5100 rupee party ko dete hai
 He says, consider it as such that the party from which the rich business people keep away, has prepared in this way
 in baton se spasht he ki bispi ko praapt dhan kaa kuch hissaa vaaki chote daan ke jariye hi aata he, lekin kis had tak, ye andaja laga paanaa asambhav he
 The comments rajyasabha ke liye die gaye apane pichley halafname main mayawati ne 100 karod rupee se zyada kii sampatti ghoshit kii thi, jisase sawaal uthe the ki unke garib samarthakon se mila paisa basapa supremeo ko amir banane ke kaam to nahin aayaa

 vah kehete hai, ise aise samajhie ki jis party se dhani vyapaaree log kinaaraa kiye rahete hai, usne is tarah taiyaari kii he
 It is clear from these facts that some part of the money received by the BSP comes only through small donations, but to what extent, it is impossible to guess

 ' karnataka chunaav 2018 ke nattejey trishanku vidhansabha kii sthiti lekar saamne aae hai
 BJP has emerged as the largest party with 104 seats in the state
 sattarudh congress 78 seat par jeet pai or jedies 38 siton par jeet ke saath behad ahm bhoomika main khadi he
 Apart from this, an under-construction bridge in Varanasi has collapsed and more than a dozen people lost their lives
 lekin bengaluru main raajnneeti ke galiyare main ek nayaa pul taiyaar hua he or is nae pul ne jodne kaa sanket dena shuru kar diya he
 The Congress, which reached the assembly with 78 seats in Karnataka, has offered support to the 38-seat JDS to form the new government
 peshkash ke mutabik sarkaar jedies kii hogi, mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami honge or congress kaa samarthan bina kisi shart ke saath he
 The construction of this new bridge in Karnataka's politics has been welcomed by TMC and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee sitting in West Bengal
 mamata banerjee ne congress ke prastaav par kaha ki "main hameshaa se kahati ai hum ki desh kii raajnneeti main kshetreey morcha or kshetreey partiyon kii behad ahm bhoomika he
 "from her statement, Mamata said clearly that if the national parties do not win the trust of the regional parties then it is impossible for them to survive in the current politics
" ise padhein: karnataka main sabase bade dal ke rup main ubhari bijepi, lekin kisi ko bhi bahumat nahinkarnataka nateezon par pehali pratikriya dete hue mamata banerjee ne twit ke sahare daawa kiya ki yadi karnataka main congress ne jedies ke saath gathbandhan main chunaav ladaa hota to nattejey bahut alag dekhne ko milte
 Just two hours after Mamta's tweet, the Congress proposed to the JDS to form the government and also assumed that since the end of voting, she was engaged in the exercise of forming the government with the JDS
 ab karnataka ke is pul ke nirmaan ke baad mamata banerjee ne ek or pul kii sambhaavnaaon ko jaahir kiya
 However, this possibility was clearly demonstrated by Mamta Banerjee in her special style
 mamata ne 38 seat jeetne vaali jedies ko badhai di lekin 78 siton par jeetne vaali or bijepi adhik vot share laane vaali congress ko badhai dena uchit nahin samajha
 Read this: The mandate has not remained the same in entire Karnataka, 6 types of results from 6 zones, Mamata Banerjee is happy about the political developments in Karnataka
 pehla, ab congress party ko rashtriya raajnneeti main apane kirdaar ko lekar bhram kii sthiti nahin he
 Secondly, the new president in the Congress, whoever the party is, is in the hands of Sonia Gandhi, representing the UPA
 mamata kaa daawa he ki karnataka nateezon se congress ko saaf samaj aa chukaa he ki ab kshetreey dalon ke saamne congress party na to apane rashtriya charitra kaa dambh bharegi or na hi rashtriya str par banane vaale kisi gathbandhan athwa mahagathbandhan ke netritv ko apane liye surakshit rakhane kii koshish karegi
 Mamta Banerjee has suggested a way to expand the bridge being constructed in Karnataka at the national level to stop the bjp-led alliance in the 2019 general elections
 iske peeche unki gathbandhan sarkaar kaa netritv karne or desh kaa piem banane kii dabi ichha bhi he
 Now the wait is how the Congress takes forward its share bridge on this formula of Mamata Banerjee
 philhal, karnataka kii sthiti se mamata banerjee behad khush hai or varanasi ke gire pul se vah dukhi hai

 The film had a lot to show, but the director and actor all missed out due to a weak story
 film kaa topic koi nayaa nahin he
 Acting of actors is also not unique
 ayushmaan ke liye kahani solid hona jaruri he, or yahi baat sonam kapur par bhi lagu hoti he
 Which is lacking in the film
 yahi kamiyaan chubhti hai or ausat acting or kamjor diarection tathaa kahani main naepan ke abhaav kii vajah se film puri tarah conect nahin kar paati he
 The story of how much of the film is set in the backdrop of the economic downturn

 Many lies are told, there are many types of dramas and there is a lot of laughter and fun in this affair
 lekin kamjor kahani khalati he
 The story lacks a vow factor
 sab bahut hi swaabhaavik he or ekadam saaf najar aata rahata he ki aage kya hone vaala he
 Star Appeal Ayushmann had a blast with Vicky Donor
 uske baad unki nautanki saalaa ausat rahi thi
 He is doing well in this film
 lekin kamjor kahani kii vajah se ve apni chamak puri tarah nahin dikhaa pate hai
 In the case of acting, Sonam Kapoor still looks somewhat crude
 beshak film main unka bikni pahanakar aana surkhiyon kii vajah bana tha lekin ve baat ko bhunaa nahin sakin or maayra kaa kirdaar aisa nahin kar saki hai jise yaad rakhaa ja sake
 Rishi Kapoor is once again in the role of a father
 kahin-kahin unki acting jamati he
 But his tough type of role seems to be repetitive and sometimes his jokes don't laugh at all
 kamai kii batfilm kaa bajet zyada nahin bataaya ja rahaa he
 The star cast is also normal
 khaas yah ki is hafte koi or film relies nahin ho rahi he
 Which can go in favor of this film
 agar youth film se judate hai to yah box offis par kuch dam maar sakati he
 By the way, the season is Holi, and at such a level it would be fun to see the audience go to theaters because the film's starcast is not a crowded puller

 uttar pradesh sarkaar ne supreme court main halafanama daayar kar kaha ki 14 saal ke baad umr kaid kii sazaa kaat rahe kaidiyon ke reeha karne ke rajya sarkaar ke adhikaar ko khatm nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The comments rajya sarkaar ne kaha ki use kanoon ke tahat yah adhikaar diya gaya he ki agar rajya sarkaar chaahe to wo 14 saal ke baad umr kaid kii sazaa kaat rahe kaidiyon ko reeha kar sakati he
 This right cannot be abolished by judicial order
 darasal, supreme court ne rajeev gandhi ke hatyaron kii rihaai ke kilaaf daayar yachika par sunwaayee karte hue rajya sarkaron se poocha tha ki kyon na unke us adhikaar ko khatm kar diya jaae, jiske tahat wo 14 saal ke baad umr kaid kii sazaa kaat rahe kaidiyon ko reeha karne kaa adhikaar he
 The state government said that it has been empowered under the law that if the state government wishes, it can release the prisoners who are sentenced to life imprisonment after 14 years
 is adhikaar ko nyaayik aadesh ke dwaara khatm nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In fact, while hearing a petition filed against the release of Rajiv Gandhi's killers, the Supreme Court had asked the state governments why they should not abolish their right under which they are sentenced to life imprisonment after 14 years
 Has the right to release
 darasal, supreme court ne rajeev gandhi ke hatyaron kii rihaai ke kilaaf daayar yachika par sunwaayee karte hue rajya sarkaron se poocha tha ki kyon na unke us adhikaar ko khatm kar diya jaae, jiske tahat wo 14 saal ke baad umr kaid kii sazaa kaat rahe kaidiyon ko reeha karne kaa adhikaar he
 The Indian team, who went on a tour of England, have also lost the chance to win the series by losing the Southampton Test and now the common cricket lover and cricket giants are criticizing the Indian team
 viraat kohliki team ko chauthe test main 60 ranon se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa or isi ke saathenglandne 5 maichon kii siries main 3-1 kii ajey badhat bhi bana lee he
 Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has questioned Virat Kohli's captaincy over India's defeat
 'ajtak' se khaas baatcheet main gavaskar ne kaha ki viraat kii captaini main ab wo baat nahin he
 He said that in the year 2014, when Virat was given the captaincy of the Test team, he worked to give a new impetus and direction to the team
 lekin usee vakt se yah saaf tha ki viraat kii asal pariksha australia, england or dakshin africa main hogi, kyonki westeindies yaa srilanka jaisi tiimon ko haraana koi badi baat nahin, wo siries to team india ke liye practice maichon kii tarah thim
 Let us know that after losing the series 2–1 against South Africa earlier this year, Kohli is captained for the second consecutive series on foreign soil
 sunil gavaskar ne kaha ki australia ke khilaaf siries jitkar viraat ne bataur captain apni kaabiliyat sabit kii thi
 But it was not seen in England
 gavaskar ne kaha ki ballebaaj ke rup main viraat ne ummid se kahin behatar pradarshan kiya he lekin captain tabhi safal ho saktaa he jab uski team pradarshan karegi
 Expectations from Virat Kohli are always very high and something similar happened this time too
 yahi vajah he ki deshbhar ke cricket premi is haar se niraash hai
 Former captain Sunil Gavaskar said the defeat was disappointing and should be reviewed
 hamen dekhnaa padegaa ki koun se khilaadi team kii jarurat hai or kise baahar kiya ja saktaa he
 He said on his statement on Hardik Pandya that Hardik has proved himself in the last few Test matches but he was not used fully as an all-rounder in this series
 gavaskar ne kaha ki team india ko aalochana se prerana leni chahie kyonki aise kai khilaadi hai jinhone kaabiliyat ke mutabik pradarshan nahin kiya he
 On the performance of the players in England, Gavaskar said that it is not right to blame one or two players for the defeat because it is a team game
 unhone kaha ki agar team india bharpoor practice match khelti to fark jarur padataa
 He said that this would have helped the players to understand the situation there
 ab iske liye team prabandhan kii jimmedaar bhi tay ho sakati he lekin unka dosha kitna he iske baar main saaf taur par kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Gavaskar said that the management and the cricket board should have shared strategies for practice matches jointly, as net practice is not enough, we need match practice
 unhone kaha ki maujuuda vakt main hamaare paas board jaisaa kuch he hi nahin, supreme court ke aadesh ke baad kuch prashaasak hi bhartiya cricket ko chalaa rahe hai

 ’afridi ne aakhri test 2006 main england ke khilaaf khelaa tha
 Since then, the selectors have ignored him, and sometimes he himself has not been available

 i am Ravish Kumar
 garib, garib, garib itani baar garib ki laga ki koi garibon ko dhund rahaa he yah bataane ke liye ki use dhanna sethon se koi mohabbat nahin he
 Throughout the speech, Dhanna Seth emerges as the industrialist, the factoryman and the industrialist with access to the corridors of power
 mathura main pradhanmantri ke bhaashan main kisi kii thik se dhulaai hui to wo dhannaseth the, kisi kaa naam to nahin liya magar unke kai aise kaam ginaae jisase itnaa to saaf ho gaya ki vah khud ko closer tu garib hi rakhana chaahate hai
 If the opposition made Dhannaseths a villain, then the Prime Minister made them as well
 yani villen to dhannaseth hi he
 Who says that our politics has become right wing
 vipaksh, nitiyon ke jaankaar, patrkaar or kai logon ne poocha ki achche din kahaan hai to pradhanmantri ne achche din naare se chhutkaaraa hi paa liya
 Gave a new slogan that the bad days are gone
 ab akhabaaron kii surkhiyon main achche din kab aaenge ki jagah kal se aap dekhenge ki baat-baat par bure din chale gaye kii tag line hogi
 The Prime Minister was in full bloom
 aaj wo achchhai se zyada buraai ke against the
 Gone are the bad days
 bure kaam band ho gaye
 Bad thinking that it did not stop
 bure halaat badale ki nahin badale
 Bad exploits have not stopped
 bure din chale gaye
 One should learn from the Prime Minister how to turn questions into questions
 shaayad aisa laga ki unhone achche din par sawaal uthaane vaale sabhi ko ek qatari main khadaa kar diya
 According to him, these are the people who had access to Delhi's corridor of power
 jo ek saal pehle tak bhai bhatijawad ke naam par koyala khadaanon kaa aavanton karvaa rahe the
 The Prime Minister said that i have stopped the game of thieves robbers
 aise logon ko is baat se pareshaani he ki sabake achche din aae, lekin kuch logon ke bure din aa gaye
 They are having problems
 ve cheekh rahe hai, chilla rahe hai
 Those who looted the country did not guarantee their good days
 unke to or bhi bure din aane vaale hai
 Are only such people questioning on a good day, who are not getting the vegetables in the corridors of power
 vaise pradhanmantri ne achche din ke bhi gun ginaae
 i personally liked one of his things and would like to believe that thing is right
 jab unhone kaha ki dilli main power centre se zyada power sarkalon kaa bolbalaa tha or abhimanyu ko to aath kothe jeetne pade the yahaan par to power sarkal ke pataa nahin saikadon kothe bane hue the or bhaaiyon bahanon aapke aashirwad se wo power sarkal ke saikadon kothe dhwast karke aaj desh main dilli ke galiyaaron main dallalon ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 Their bad days are bound to come
 or isliye wo zaraa cheekh rahe hai
 When Rahul Gandhi said the government of the suit boot, it was meant that the industrialists have reached the Delhi corridor
 akhbaaron main bhi aisi khabaren rahati hai, lekin unhone bahut jor diya ki unki sarkaar main koi ghotaalaa nahin hua he
 The Prime Minister also did not spare Dhannaseths with opponents
 unhone vistaar se bataaya ki kaise rasaynic khaad banane vaali factriyon ke dhanna seth kisaanon ko uria chori karte hai
 They said, hamane fertiliser par uria par neem kaa coating lagaana shuru kiya he
 Previously the subsidy did not reach the farmer earlier
 ye dhannaseth urvarak chura kar apni chemical factoriyaan chalaate the
 We have put neem coating on the fertilizer, now it will not work in any chemical factory
 pradhanmantri ne fertiliser factory chalaane waalon par ek gambhir aarope lagaaya he
 This raises the question as to how many such Dhannaseths have registered cases of urea theft and subsidy theft
 aap google kar sakate hai ki koun koun dhannaseth fertiliser factory chalaate hai
 If we checked Google then the government has decided in March
 30 march ke pitiai kii khabar ke anusaar sarkaar ne gharelu urvarak companiyon ke liye neem kot uria anivaary kar diya he
 This will save 6500 crore subsidy of the government every year
 kendriya urvarak mantri anant kumaar ne kaha he ki neem kot uria ke istamaal se fasalon kaa utpaadan 15-20 pratishat bad jaataa he
 The Fertilizer Association of India has welcomed the government's move and said that the industry has been demanding for many years that the limit on production of neem coat urea be lifted
 isse mitti kii poshakta ko barkaraar rakhane main madad milegi
 The Prime Minister also talked about increasing productivity, but described the decision as if it was taken to prevent theft
 mani control dot com kii ek khabar mili saat janvari 2015 kii
 There is no mention in the news of PTI and Money Control
com that these steps have been taken to prevent subsidy and urea theft
 manicontrol dot com kii khabar main fertiliser association of india ke mahanideshak satish chandra ne kaha he ki ham to kai saalon se vinati kar rahe the ki 35 pratishat kii bandish hate
 This will increase productivity and due to reduced nitrogen content, crops will not get insects
 lekin isse uria kaa paanch pratishat tak daam bad jayega
 That is, 200 to 300 rupees per ton will have to be paid by the farmers themselves, the government will not give subsidy on it
 ab yah saaf nahin he ki sarkaar ne chori pakadaney ke baad yah kadam uthaaya yaa fertiliser association kii vinati ko jaays maanakar
 The Prime Minister said another big thing that if someone says something else, it will be immediately declared anti-development and communist
 unhone kaha ki kitni bhi badi company kyon na ho wo zyada rojgaar nahin de paati he
 Gives employment to 6 crore small traders, small factories, which run vegetable carts, sell milk, newspapers, 6 crore people give employment to 120 million people
 kaala dhan kitna aayaa ye to nahin bataaya, lekin yah zarur kaha ki bharat kaa safed dhan ab baahar nahin ja rahaa he
 The government seemed to be pro-poor, therefore, it gave special emphasis to those schemes which are related to agriculture, pension and insurance
 hamane google kiya to pataa chalaa ki paryaton mantralay videshi paryatakon ke aankade jari karata he jiske anusaar, 2012 main 65 lakh 77 hazaar paryatak bharat aae, 2013 main 69 lakh 67 hazaar paryatak bharat aae, 2014 main 74 lakh 62 hazaar paryatak bharat aae
 Given these figures, it was a pleasant surprise that between 1997 and 2014, the number of foreign tourists has steadily increased
 tippaniyan The Prime Minister said that electricity has not been produced in the last one year in twenty years
 iskaa laabh aap log mahasoos bhi kar rahe honge ki ab pehle bijli kam jaati hogi
 In the first week of May, Minister of State for Power in the Lok Sabha Piyush Goyal gave a statement that so much electricity has been generated that people were ready to give it free but the state is not buying enough electricity
 pradhanmantri kii sari baton kaa zikr nahin kar paa rahaa hum, kyonki unhone khud kaha he ki 365 din jo kaam kiya he agar main sara ginane lag jaaun to 365 ghante kam pad jaaenge
 i do not get exactly one hour for prime time
 to bure din chale gaye ye acha slogan he yaa achche din aaenge ye badhiya he
 In Mathura, the Prime Minister was destroying the perception or Dhannaseths
 vipaksh ne dhannasethon ko villen banaaya to pradhanmantri ne bhi unhen bana diya
 That is, the villain is only Dhannaseth
 koun kahata he ki hamaari raajnneeti rhite wing ho gai he
 Opposition, policy makers, journalists and many people asked where are the good days, then the Prime Minister got rid of the slogans on good days
 ek nayaa naaraa garh diya ki bure din chale gaye
 Now when will the good days come in the news headlines that from tomorrow you will see that there will be a tag line that bad days have gone on talking
 pradhanmantri puri ron main the
 Today he was against evil more than good
 bure din chale gaye
 Bad things stopped
 buree soch band hui ki nahin hui
 Bad conditions do not change
 bure karname band hue ki nahin hue
 Gone are the bad days
 sawaalon ko palatakar sawaal main badalane kaa andaaz koi pradhanmantri se siikhe
 Perhaps it seemed that he put everyone in question on a good day in a row
 unke anusaar ye wo log hai jinaki pahunch dilli kii satta ke galiyare tak ho gai thi
 Who till one year ago were allotting coal mines in the name of brother nepotism
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki maine chor luteron ke khel band karvaa diye hai
 Such people are troubled by the fact that good days come, but some people have bad days
 unhen pareshaani ho rahi he
 They are screaming, screaming
 jin logon ne desh ko lutaa unke achche din kii guarantee nahin di thi
 Their worse days are coming
 kya sirf aise hi log achche din par sawaal kar rahe hai jinhen satta ke galiyare main revadiyaan nahin mil rahi hai
 By the way, the Prime Minister also counted the good days
 unki ek baat mujhe vyaktigat taur par acchhee lagi or yakeen karnaa chaahunga ki wo baat sahi ho
 When he said that more power circles were dominated than the power center in Delhi, and Abhimanyu had to win eight brothels, but hundreds of brothels were not known in the power circle and brothers and sisters, with your blessings, he dismantled hundreds of brothels
 There is no place for brokers in Delhi's corridors today
 unke bure din aana swaabhaavik he
 And so they are screaming a little
 rahul gandhi ne suut boot kii sarkaar kaha to yahi aashay tha ki dilli ke galiyare main udyogpatiyon kii pahunch ho gai he
 There are also such reports in newspapers, but he stressed very much that there was no scandal in his government
 pradhanmantri ne virodhiyon ke saath dhannasethon ko bhi nahin bakhsha
 He explained how Dhanna Seth of chemical fertilizer factories steals urea to farmers
 unhone kaha, We have started applying neem coating on urea on the fertilizer
 pehle jo sabsidi pehle kisaan tak nahin pahunchati thi
 These Dhannaseths used to steal fertilizers and run their chemical factories
 hamane fertiliser par neem coating kar diya ab wo kisi chemical factory ke kaam nahin aayega
 The Prime Minister has made a serious charge against those running the fertilizer factory
 jisase yah sawaal banataa he ki kitne aise dhannasethon ke khilaaf uria chori or sabsidi chori ke maamle darj hue hai
 You can google who runs Dhannaseth Fertilizer Factory
 hamane google check kiya to vaaki sarkaar ne march main aisa faisla kiya he
 According to the PTI news of March 30, the government has made neem coat urea mandatory for domestic fertilizer companies
 isse har saal sarkaar kii 6500 karod sabsidi bachegi
 Union Fertilizer Minister Anant Kumar has said that the use of neem coat urea increases the production of crops by 15-20 percent
 fertiliser association of india ne sarkaar ke is kadam kaa swaagat kiya he or kaha he ki udyog kai varshon se maang karata rahaa he ki neem kot uria ke utpaadan par lagi seemaa ko hataa diya jaae
 This will help in maintaining soil nutrient
 pradhanmantri ne bhi utpaadakta badhaane kii baat kii, lekin is faisle ko aise bataaya jaise chori rokane ke liye liya gaya ho
 a report from Moneycontrol
com was received on 7 January 2015
 pitiai or mani control dot com kii khabar main is baat kaa zikr nahin he ki ye kadam sabsidi or uria kii chori rokane ke liye uthaae gaye hai
 In the news of Moneycontrol
com, Director General of Fertilizer Association of India Satish Chandra said that we had been pleading for many years that the restriction of 35 percent should be lifted
 isse utpaadakta badhegi or nitrogen kii maatra kam nikalne se fasalon main keede nahin lagenge
 But this will increase the price of urea by five percent
 yani prati ton 200 se 300 rupee dene honge jo kisaan khud denge, sarkaar is par sabsidi nahin degi
 It is not clear now whether the government took this step after catching the theft or justified the request of the Fertilizer Association
 pradhanmantri ne ek or badi baat kahi jo agar koi doosraa kah de to use turant vikaas virdohi or communist qaraar diya jayega
 He said that no matter how big a company is, it is not able to provide much employment
 rojgaar detaa he 6 karod chota vyapaaree, chote kaarkaane, jo sabzi kaa thela chalaate hai, doodh bechate hai, akhbaar bechate hai aise 6 karod log 12 karod logon ko rojgaar dete hai
 i did not tell how much black money came, but it definitely said that India's white money is not going out now
 sarkaar garibon kii samarthak lage isliye un yojanaon par hi vishesh rup se jor diya jinka sambandh kheti, pension or beemaa se ho
 When we did Google, it was found out that the Ministry of Tourism released figures of foreign tourists, according to which 65 lakh 77 thousand tourists visited India in 2012, 69 lakh 67 thousand tourists visited India in 2013, 74 lakh 62 thousand tourists visited India in 2014
 in aankadon ko dekhte hue yah sukhad hairaani hui ki 1997 se lekar 2014 ke bich videshi paryatakon kii sankhya lagaataar badi hi he
 The comments pradhanmantri ne kaha ki pichley ek saal main bijli kaa jitna utpaadan hua he utana bees saal main nahin hua
 You people must be feeling the benefit of this, that now electricity will be reduced first
 may ke pehle hafte main loksabhaa main bijli rajyamantri piyush goyal ne bayaan diya ki itani bijli paidaa ho gai he ki log free main dene ko taiyaar the lekin rajya paryaapt bijli nahin kharid rahe hai
 i am not able to mention all the things of the Prime Minister, because he himself has said that if i start counting all the work done 365 days, then 365 hours will be reduced
 mujhe to thik se ek ghante bhi nahin milte hai prime time ke liye
 So the bad days are gone, is it a good slogan or will the good days come? mathura main pradhanmantri dharna ko dharashayi kar rahe the yaa dhannasethon ko
 The Prime Minister was in full bloom
 aaj wo achchhai se zyada buraai ke against the
 Gone are the bad days

 pradhanmantri ne ek or badi baat kahi jo agar koi doosraa kah de to use turant vikaas virdohi or communist qaraar diya jayega
 He said that no matter how big a company is, it is not able to provide much employment
 rojgaar detaa he 6 karod chota vyapaaree, chote kaarkaane, jo sabzi kaa thela chalaate hai, doodh bechate hai, akhbaar bechate hai aise 6 karod log 12 karod logon ko rojgaar dete hai
 i did not tell how much black money came, but it definitely said that India's white money is not going out now
 sarkaar garibon kii samarthak lage isliye un yojanaon par hi vishesh rup se jor diya jinka sambandh kheti, pension or beemaa se ho
 When we did Google, it was found out that the Ministry of Tourism released figures of foreign tourists, according to which 65 lakh 77 thousand tourists visited India in 2012, 69 lakh 67 thousand tourists visited India in 2013, 74 lakh 62 thousand tourists visited India in 2014
 in aankadon ko dekhte hue yah sukhad hairaani hui ki 1997 se lekar 2014 ke bich videshi paryatakon kii sankhya lagaataar badi hi he
 The comments pradhanmantri ne kaha ki pichley ek saal main bijli kaa jitna utpaadan hua he utana bees saal main nahin hua
 You people must be feeling the benefit of this, that now electricity will be reduced first
 may ke pehle hafte main loksabhaa main bijli rajyamantri piyush goyal ne bayaan diya ki itani bijli paidaa ho gai he ki log free main dene ko taiyaar the lekin rajya paryaapt bijli nahin kharid rahe hai
 i am not able to mention all the things of the Prime Minister, because he himself has said that if i start counting all the work done 365 days, then 365 hours will be reduced
 mujhe to thik se ek ghante bhi nahin milte hai prime time ke liye
 So the bad days are gone, is it a good slogan or will the good days come? mathura main pradhanmantri dharna ko dharashayi kar rahe the yaa dhannasethon ko
 When Rahul Gandhi said the government of the suit boot, it was meant that the industrialists have reached the Delhi corridor
 akhbaaron main bhi aisi khabaren rahati hai, lekin unhone bahut jor diya ki unki sarkaar main koi ghotaalaa nahin hua he
 The Prime Minister also did not spare Dhannaseths with opponents
 unhone vistaar se bataaya ki kaise rasaynic khaad banane vaali factriyon ke dhanna seth kisaanon ko uria chori karte hai
 They said, hamane fertiliser par uria par neem kaa coating lagaana shuru kiya he
 Previously the subsidy did not reach the farmer earlier
 ye dhannaseth urvarak chura kar apni chemical factoriyaan chalaate the
 We have put neem coating on the fertilizer, now it will not work in any chemical factory
 pradhanmantri ne fertiliser factory chalaane waalon par ek gambhir aarope lagaaya he
 This raises the question as to how many such Dhannaseths have registered cases of urea theft and subsidy theft
 aap google kar sakate hai ki koun koun dhannaseth fertiliser factory chalaate hai
 If we checked Google then the government has decided in March
 30 march ke pitiai kii khabar ke anusaar sarkaar ne gharelu urvarak companiyon ke liye neem kot uria anivaary kar diya he
 This will save 6500 crore subsidy of the government every year
 kendriya urvarak mantri anant kumaar ne kaha he ki neem kot uria ke istamaal se fasalon kaa utpaadan 15-20 pratishat bad jaataa he
 The Fertilizer Association of India has welcomed the government's move and said that the industry has been demanding for many years that the limit on production of neem coat urea be lifted
 isse mitti kii poshakta ko barkaraar rakhane main madad milegi
 The Prime Minister also talked about increasing productivity, but described the decision as if it was taken to prevent theft
 mani control dot com kii ek khabar mili saat janvari 2015 kii

 This will increase productivity and due to reduced nitrogen content, crops will not get insects
 lekin isse uria kaa paanch pratishat tak daam bad jayega
 That is, 200 to 300 rupees per ton will have to be paid by the farmers themselves, the government will not give subsidy on it
 ab yah saaf nahin he ki sarkaar ne chori pakadaney ke baad yah kadam uthaaya yaa fertiliser association kii vinati ko jaays maanakar
 The Prime Minister said another big thing that if someone says something else, it will be immediately declared anti-development and communist
 unhone kaha ki kitni bhi badi company kyon na ho wo zyada rojgaar nahin de paati he
 Gives employment to 6 crore small traders, small factories, which run vegetable carts, sell milk, newspapers, 6 crore people give employment to 120 million people
 kaala dhan kitna aayaa ye to nahin bataaya, lekin yah zarur kaha ki bharat kaa safed dhan ab baahar nahin ja rahaa he

 isse utpaadakta badhegi or nitrogen kii maatra kam nikalne se fasalon main keede nahin lagenge
 But this will increase the price of urea by five percent
 yani prati ton 200 se 300 rupee dene honge jo kisaan khud denge, sarkaar is par sabsidi nahin degi
 It is not clear now whether the government took this step after catching the theft or justified the request of the Fertilizer Association

 bataa den ki bhopal sansadeey seat se chunavi maidan main utari aatankwaad maamle kii aaropee sadhvi pragna ne nathuram godse ko deshbhakt bataaya tha
 Speaking to the media after voting, Nitish Kumar said that there is a need to change the schedule of Lok Sabha elections
 maine chunaav prachaar ke dauraan mahasoos kiya he ki garmi ke maheene or lambey charan ke chalate logon ko raily main aane or matdaan main kaaphi pareshaani hoti he
 So the election should not be so long in the summer month

 Nitish Kumar said that after the Lok Sabha elections, he will write a letter to all the parties in the country to improve the election schedule
 iske liye sarvadaleey baithak honi chahie
 It should be said that the election should not be so long but it is better if elections are held in one to two phases
 unhone kaha ki ek charan se duusare charan ke bich itnaa lanbaa gap nahin hona chahie
 Nitish said that the seats on which the elections were held in the first phase could be held in the next phase of the seats next to it
 iske alaava april-may ke bajaay farvari-march yaa phir oktober-november ke maheene main hi hone chahie
 Nitish said, 'I am saying this based on my experience

 According to the victim, when the water started going above the head, she decided to tell the whole thing to her family and went to the police station to file a complaint against the professor
 peedit chaatra auki parijanon kaa kahana he ki jab unhone college kii dusri ladakiyon se baat kii to pataa chalaa ki aaropee professor unhen bhi pareshaan kar rahaa tha
 He had sent obscene messages to many college students
 chaatraon ne bataaya ki jab principal se professor ke khilaaf shikaayat kii gai to unhone bhi ection lene kii bajaay ulataa unhen hi chup kara diya

 In this case, the police had registered a case against the accused professor on January 31, but he has not been arrested yet

 20 oktober ko uparajyapal ke sachiv vijay kumaar ne is maamle kii file waapas bhej di he, jisamen sarkaar se teen sawaal puche gaye hai

 The Delhi cabinet had passed the proposal, in fact, the Delhi cabinet passed a resolution on 31 August and decided to give 10 crore more funds to every Delhi MLA in this financial year, which was to be used to install roads and street lights
 agle saal emsidi chunaav hone hai or isliye vidhayak fund ko lekar dilli sarkaar kaa prastaav kaaphi ahm tha, kyonki iske jariye vidhayak apane ilaakon main paisa kharch karke siyaasi phayda uthaa sakate the
 But now one thing is clear from the questions of the Lieutenant Governor that it will be difficult to implement this scheme early

 canada ke raksha mantri harjit singh sajjan ko lekar punjab main vivaad paidaa ho gaya he
 Actually, Sajjan is visiting Punjab on 20 April
 is bich punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amrendra singh ne unhen khalistaani samarthak bataa kar unka swaagat na karne kii baat kii hai
 Sajjan Singh will reach Chandigarh on 20 April and will visit the Golden Temple in Amritsar on 21 April
 lekin is dauraan naa to punjab ke siem captain amarinder singh or naa hi unki cabinet kaa koi bhi mantri unhen risive karne ke liye pahonchega
 Rather, only SSC and DC of Amritsar would welcome Sajjan Singh
 gauratlab he ki punjab sarkaar ne saaf kar diya he ki sajjan singh ko lekar captain amarinder singh kaa stand bilkul sahi he, or puri sarkaar captain ke is faisle main unke saath khadi hai
 Charanjit Singh Channi, the cabinet minister of the Punjab government, said that "the stand of the Punjab government is the same as that of Captain Saheb" for the visit of the Canadian Defense Minister

 "whereas Canada's first Sikh Defense Minister Harjit Singh Sajjan's visit to Punjab has been the center of controversy by Chief Minister Captain Amarendra Singh's statement that he was pro-khalistani
 vahiin punjab ke hoshiyarpur se 20 kilometre dur unke paitruk gaanv bambeli ke log bina kisi vivaad main pade apane gaanv ke sapoot ke joardaar swaagat main jute hai

 unka swaagat karne ke liye pita kundan singh, maa vidya cor va bahan amarjit cor bhi us pal kaa besabri se intjaar kar rahe hai
 Kundan Singh, father of Canadian Defense Minister Harjit Singh Sajjan in Bambeli village, said, "captain Amarendra Singh Panjabke is the Chief Minister
 i will not comment on his statement
" kundan singh ne kaha ki agar mere bete main koi aisi khami hoti to canada jaisaa desh use apana rakshaamantri naa banaata
 At the same time, the opposition parties Akali Dal and Aam Aadmi Party have also jumped into this whole controversy
 aam aadmi party ne aarope lagaaya ki captain amarinder singh ko haal hi main hue vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan canada main baithe punjabiyon ne samarthan nahin diya or isi vajah se ab captain amarinder singh ko canada ke raksha mantri bhi khalistaan samarthak najar aa rahe hai
 The Akali Dal said that Sajjan Singh has become the first Sikh Defense Minister of Canada and it is a matter of pride for Sikhs
 agar punjab sarkaar sajjan singh kaa punjab pahunchane par uchit swaagat nahin karegi to akali dal kii taraf se sajjan singh ko puraa sammaan punjab aane par diya jayega
 Captain Amarinder Singh's relations with the Punjabis settled abroad have not been good and during the visit of Captain Amarinder Singh in Canada and America, his opposition has also been Punjabi settled there
 or ab captain ne jab sajjan singh ko khalistaani qaraar de diya to isko lekar captain ke khilaaf vipaksh ke saath-saath kai sikh sanghathan bhi lamaband ho gaye hai
 But amid this whole controversy, the first Sikh Defense Minister of Canada, Sajjan Singh has come to India and now it will be seen how his visit to Punjab brings political shock in the coming time

 At some places, the film becomes very loud and a little slow after the interval

 Therefore, this film can serve to give new spice to the audience
 iske paas ek hafte kaa samay he kyonki agle hafte ‘gori tere pyaar main’ or ‘singh saab da great’ relies ho rahi hai
 So these three days mean a lot for Ram and Leela
 sanjay filmein to acchhee banaate hai lekin pichley kuch samay se unke diarection vaali filmein box offis par bada chamatkaar nahin kar saki hai, isliye ram-lila kii kamyaabi kaaphi kuch tay karegi

 That is why Chennai Super Kings captain MS Dhoni also wants to lighten his bat

 1972 main gathit ek cameti kii report ke baad 1976 main kaveri jal vivaad ke sabhi chaar daavedaaron ke bich agreement kiya gaya, jisaki ghoshnaa sansad main hui
 Despite this, the dispute continued
 1986 main tamilnadu ne antarraji jal vivaad adhinium (1956) ke tahat centre sarkaar se ek tribunel kii maang kii
 The Tribunal was formed in 1990
 tribunel ne faisla kiya ki karnataka kii ore se kaveri jal kaa tay hissaa tamilnadu ko milegaa
 Karnataka believes that it was a princely state during the British rule while Tamil Nadu was a slave to the British, hence the 1924 agreement was not justified
 karnataka kaa kahana he ki tamilnadu kii tulana main vahaan krishi der se shuru hua
 He is first in the path of the river, he has full authority over it
 tamilnadu puraane samjhauton ko tarksangat bataate hue kahata he, 1924 ke samjhaute ke anusaar, jal kaa jo hissaa use miltaa tha, ab bhi vahi mili
 The Center set up the tribunal on June 1990 and so far efforts are on to resolve the dispute
 jammu-kashmir ke kupwada main army camp par hue aatanki hamale main sena ke teen jawan shahid ho gaye jinamein ek captain or ek jesio bhi shaamil hai
 In the attack, the security forces killed two terrorists
 hamale main shahid captain aayush yadav ne aatankiyon se loha lete hue desh ke liye sarvocch balidaan de diya
 The country is saluting the martyrdom of the soldiers, but the families of the soldiers are asking sharp questions to the government that how long they will continue to lose their sons
 sarkaar se pita ke sawalupi ke kanupar main rahane vaale shahid aayush yadav ke pita arun yadav ne sarkaar se poocha he ki unhone to apana betaa kho diya lekin aakhir kab tak desh apane beton ko aise hi khota rahegaa
 He told that Ayush was his only son and on Wednesday he spoke to his son over the phone
 aayush ne apane pita ko ghoomane ke liye srinagar bulaayaa tha
 But when the father said that there is a lot of stonewalling there, Ayush started laughing at it
 sukama ke shaheedon kii yaadado din pehle hi sukama main hue naksali hamale main bhi siapief ke 25 jawan shahid ho gaye the
 When the bodies of the soldiers reached their home, their families were also asking the government the same question as to how long our youth would have to be martyred for the country
 sarkaar ne kaha he ki aatanki or naksali hamale rokane ke liye sakht kadam uthaae jaaenge taaki desh ke dushmano ko muhantod jawaab diya ja sake
 Army camps are targets
 Let us know that for the last few days, terrorists have been continuously targeting army camps
 haal hi main jammu kashmir ke nauhatta main bhi siarpief camp par grenade hamalaa hua tha
 a policeman was killed in this attack
 isse pehle uri, pathankot or kupwada main hue aatanki hamalon main bhi surakshabalon ke thikaanon ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya tha
 Our jawans were able to give a befitting reply to the enemy: On the terror attack of Hansraj Ahirkupwara, Minister of State for Home Hansraj Ahir says that our army is capable of giving a befitting reply to the enemy
 unhone kaha ki pados ke man main paap he, vahaan se aatankwaad ko protsaahit kiya ja rahaa he, lekin hamaari sena iskaa kadaa jawaab dene ke liye taiyaar he
 He said, 'our three soldiers have been martyred
 iskaa hamako dukh he
 We have also killed two of his terrorists
 abhi search oparation chal rahaa he
 We will not allow the enemy's intentions to succeed
 pados se lambey samay se koshish kii ja rahi he
 To carry out such attacks in Jammu and Kashmir, but we are failing them
 grih mantralay main aaj baithak hui thi
 The meeting was reviewed regarding the attack
 sukama main hue naksali hamale par grih rajyamantri hansraj ahir kaa kahana he ki naksali chhupakar hamalaa karte hai, jabaki ham ko maidan se ladanaa padataa he
 It is easy for him to attack, because he stays in this line for 24 hours continuously
 lekin hamaare liye thodi pareshaani he
 Our 25 soldiers have been martyred
 lagaataar naksaliyon se ladaai ladi ja rahi he
 We will eliminate the Naxalites
 naksalwad ko khatm karke rahenge
 There has been a meeting in the Ministry of Home Affairs also regarding this incident
 puri ghatana kaa vishleshan kiya ja rahaa he

 In Maldives, the President Abdulla Yameen has imposed emergency bypassing the order of the Supreme Court
 vah taanaashaahee ke raste par bad rahe hai
 In the midst of this political crisis, opposition camps of Maldives against the dictatorship of President Yameen and Supreme Court have requested India for help
 pehle bhi aise sankat main maldive kii madad bharat kar chukaa he, lekin aisa lagata he is baar bharat ke liye yah aasaan nahin he
 There is a religious crisis in front of India
 bharat se sainya hastkshep kii mangamaldive ke ghatnakram kii bharat sahit duniya ke kai deshon ne aalochana kii he
 Opposition parties there clearly say that President Yameen is working under pressure from China and India should intervene in such a difficult time
 kya he mushkilek bade bhai jaise desh hone ke naate bharat hameshaa maldive kii madad karata rahaa he
 India has had a very close relationship with Maldives for decades, so in any crisis, the people of Maldives remember India
 maldive kii loktantric takaton kii guhaar ko bharat ansuna bhi nahin kar saktaa
 But this time in front of India, there is a dire situation
 is baar mushkil yah he ki maldive main chini hastkshep kaaphi bad chukaa he
 It is being said that the current President there is acting at the behest of China
 aise main bharat ke sainya hastkshep ke baad agar kahin china ne karrwai kii tohind mahaasagaramen mahashaktiyon kaa takaraav shuru ho saktaa he
 India would not like to lose much of its interest in trying to save another country
 aise main bharat ke paas vikalp bahut kam bache hai
 The Modi government does not want to take any hasty step on this sensitive issue
 iske pehle 1980 ke dashak main rajeev gandhi sarkaar dwaara srilanka main kiye gaye hastkshep kaa bharat ko kaaphi nuksaan uthaanaa padaa tha
 For this reason Rajiv Gandhi himself was killed
 pehle bhi kii thi madad1988 main maldive main jab takhta palat kii koshish kii gai thi to bharat sarkaar kaa hastkshep safal rahaa tha
 But this threat was not great
 ek chote se samooh dwaara takhta palat kii koshish kii gai thi or tatkaaleen raashtrapati gayum rajdhani maale main ek imaarat main surakshit chhipe the
 This time the matter is different, this time the issue is not due to the coup, but because of internal politics there
 kisi padosi desh kii aantarik raajnneeti main dakhal dena jokhim bharaa sabit ho saktaa he
 After foreign intervention, many times the atmosphere in public becomes against him
 isliye bharat intjaar kar rahaa he or america, britain se is bare main paraamarsh bhi kar rahaa he
 This is why India does not want to send troops to Maldives this time and is trying to pressure Yameen through diplomatic contacts
 yamin china ke behad kareebi hai
 Nasheed, who was its first president, was close to India, but was ousted from power in 2012
 saal 2015 main nashid ko giraftaar kar liya gaya or un par aatankwaad jaise maamle darj kiye gaye
 Angered by this, PM Modi canceled his visit to Male
 isse yamin or bhadak gaye
 China's growing occupation is close to that of India in the Indian Ocean
 isliye yah samrik lihaaj se bharat ourchin donon ke liebohut mahatvapurn bhi he
 Ever since Yameen came to power, China's interference on this island country has been increasing
 ek international airport ko apgrade karne kaa bhartiya company jiemr ko mila aakarshak sauda yamin ne radd kar ek chini company ko de diya
 In December last year, Yameen entered into a free trade agreement with China
 iske liye bahumat saansadon kii manjuuri bhi nahin lee gai or samvidhan ke khilaaf jaakar yah samjhauta hua
 India has fewer options
 Now that President Yameen is close to China, a lot depends on how he plays his card
 is sankat kaa sabase acha samaadhaan to yah he ki ghoshnaa ke mutabik vahaan november main chunaav ho or sabhi raajnneetigyon ko chunaav ladane diya jaae
 India and Western countries would like Nasheed to come back to power
 maldive ek sunni bahul paramparawaadi desh he or maujuuda raashtrapati kattarpanth ko badhaava de rahe hai
 a large number of youth from Maldives have joined ISIS
 bharat kaa hit isi main he ki nashid satta main aaen, lekin philhal to bharat ke paas intjaar karne ke alaava or koi rasta nahin dikh rahaa

 ' After getting the status of Tiger State in Madhya Pradesh, the entire Kamal Nath government was engaged in patting its back
 akhabaaron main siem kamalnath ke bade bade vigyaapan aaye the lekin tiger state kaa darja milane ke baad 3 baaghon kii maut par bijepi ne sawaal khadey kiye hai or tiger state ke darje par credit lene ko sarkaar kii besharmi bataaya he
 Two days ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi released the tiger population across the country and gave Madhya Pradesh the status of a tiger state with 526 tigers
 saalon baad mili tiger state ke darje se kamalnath sarkaar itani gadgad hui ki akhabaaron main vigyaapan dekar is sammaan kaa shrey khud ko de diya
 There will hardly be any such newspaper in Madhya Pradesh capital Bhopal in which the government has not beaten the drum of getting tiger state status by advertising
 lekin jis vakt tiger state kaa darja milane par soobe ke mukhiya kamalnath kii akhabaaron main tasviren chap rahi thi usee vakt madhyapradesh ke bandhavgarh tiger rigerv main baaghon kii maut kii tasviren khinchi ja rahi thim
 Actually, 3 tigers have died in 2 days in Bandhavgarh National Park
 ye mautein tab hui jab 3 din pehle hi madhyapradesh ko tiger state kaa darja diya gaya he
 Three tigers have been found in the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, including the bodies of a tigress, her nine-month-old cub and another tiger
 lekin sirf yahi nahin, bijepi ne beete 7 maheenon main hui baaghon kii maut ke aankade jari kar sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa he
 BJP says that a total of 20 tigers have died in Madhya Pradesh since the coming of the Kamal Nath government
 purv mantri or bijepi vidhayak vishwaas saarang kii ore se vidhansabha main baaghon kii maut ko lekar puche gaye ek sawaal ke jawaab main khud sarkaar ne bataaya he ki disambar 2018 se 27 june 2019 tak madhya pradesh main 17 baaghon kii maut hui he
 Of these, 3 tigers died due to poaching while 5 tigers died due to electrocution
 jaankaree ke mutabik baaki ke baagh aapasi ladaai yaa phir prakritik kaarnon se maare gaye
 At the same time, 3 more tigers died after getting the status of Tiger State, after which the death toll of tigers has reached 20 in the Kamal Nath government
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki tiger state kaa darja unki sarkaar kii vajah se mila lekin congress sarkaar vigyaapan dekar iskaa jhootha credit le rahi he
 BJP MLA Vishwas Sarang said, 'this is shameless government
 ek taraf to aap ke 8 maheene ke kaarykaal main us din tak ritern tiger state ghoshit hua tab tak 17 tiger mare hai
 The AAP gave this answer in return for my question in the Legislative Assembly and three tigers died after the day Tiger State was declared
 aap apni peeth thapthapa rahe hai mukhyamantri ke vigyaapan chhap rahe hai
 Vishwas Sarang further says that the number of tigers has increased after 2003, it is the effort of the Bharatiya Janata Party government because increasing tiger numbers is not a two to four months work
 This is a process
 10 saal digvijay singh kii sarkaar rahi or uski vajah se 2006 main hamaare yahaan tiger kii sankhya main bahut teji se giravat ai or uske baad sarkaar jaagi
 Our government started working and we reached the number of 543 tigers and the Congress lost 20 tigers in an 8-month rule
 ''aapasi ladaai he maut kii vajah'- vanmantrilgataar ho rahi baaghon kii maut par sawaal uthe to sarkaar ko bhi safai dene saamne aana padaa
 Umang Singhar, forest minister in the Kamal Nath government, says that one of the major reasons for the death of tigers is the fighting in the area, which the government is trying to reduce by increasing the area
 umang singhar ne kaha ki 'dekhie credit lene vaali koi baat nahin he
 i want to say that if there is a wild animal associated with our ecosystem, there is nothing to take credit in that
 vanmantri ne aage kaha ki baar-baar yahi baat aati he ki sher mar gaye
 Now he died because of hunting or due to conflict or territory among themselves
 yah cheez mahatvapurn he
 Lions die mostly due to conflict
 teritorial kshetra ham log badha rahe hai isiilie ham log kai ilaake bana rahe hai taaki baagh kaa kshetrafal bade or aapas main lade nahin ek tiger ko rahane ke liye 65 se 80 kilometre kaa aria chahie
 However, in the midst of the politics on the tiger called the pride of Madhya Pradesh, it is undoubtedly a matter of pride that Madhya Pradesh got the status of Tiger State, but now is the time for such arrangements that do not pose any threat to this beautiful national animal species
 madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri kamalnath ne bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ko kadi chetavanee di he
 On the statements of the BJP leaders to topple the government, Kamalnath has said that if there is strength among the BJP leaders, then the government should be dropped
 wo bayaanbaji kyon karte hai
 Do not have mercy on us india today ke kaarykram 'mind rox' main shirkat karte hue kamalnath se jab sawaal kiya gaya ki bijepi ke kai netaa kehete hai ki ve jab chahenge aapaki sarkaar gira denge
 On this, Kamal Nath said that we have proved majority in the assembly
 vidhansabha main jab spikar kaa chunaav hua bijepi ne bhi apana ummidavaar utaara tha
 What was the result then? wo (bijpi) haare
 This was followed by the election of deputy speaker
 usamen bhi ve haare
 The program was conducted by Saeed Ansari, Executive Editor (special Projects) of 'aaj Tak'
 siem ne kaha ki bijepi party ke kaaryakartaaon kaa manobal banaakar rakhane ke liye kahati he ki ham sarkaar gira denge
 Why do you make rhetoric? himmat he to aap sarkaar giraaen
 Please tell that many leaders of Madhya Pradesh BJP claim to bring down the government in the state
 bijepi netaa kailash vijayawargeey ne daawa kiya tha kamalnath sarkaar bijepi kii krupa se chal rahi he or jis din party alaakaman ko cheenk bhar aa gayi, usee din madhya pradesh main bijepi phir se satta main aa jaaegi
 On the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, on what was lost in the Lok Sabha elections, Chief Minister Kamal Nath said that the people rejected us in the election, i accept this
 maine haar kii jimmedaar lee
 This election was not on the subject of the state
 ham sweekaar karte hai ki ham apni baat janata tak nahin pahunchaa paae
 We accept this
 siem ne kaha ki bijepi kaa ek swatantraaa senaanee nahin rahaa or ye rashtrabhakt kii baat karte hai
 Our electoral system was weaker than the BJP
 ham janata tak sandesh nahin pahunchaa paae

 Their preparation saves us, but what is the preparation of the civil administration
 mumbai, chennai, dilli, gudgaanv, bangaleru sirf shahar badal rahe hai, magar har saal yaa kuch saal ke baad barish kii tabaahi ham sabake saamne unheen sawaalon ko lekar khadi ho jaati he
 Where there are ponds, there are ponds, there is land for the spread of rivers, encroachment on them all
 atikaraman gaiyr kanoonee bhi or kanoonee tareeke se bhi
 Development authorities go after cutting the plot and where we fill the soil and build a house
 sochate hai ki ab ham surakshit hai
 If you have forgotten the rain of Chennai in November 2015, then tell us what is the guarantee that you will not forget the floods of Kerala too soon
 yah kaam aapaki memory power smriti shakti kaa nahin he balki us system kaa he jo aisi tabaahi se sikhta he
 The devastation of Chennai's rains in November 2015 is the same reason as the Kerala floods of 2018
 us vakt hamane prime time main jin kaarnon kii suchi banaai thi, phir se dikhaanaa chaahate hai taaki ham khud ko yaad dilaa saken ki ham bhul jate hai
 Governments fall asleep
 agali barish main kuch sau log mar jate hai
 In November 2015, more than 347 people were killed in the Chennai metropolis alone
 ek lakh se adhik gharon ko nuksaan pahunchaa tha
 How can the flood of Kerala begin with the flood of Chennai metropolis
 do saal pehle chennai ke vakt ham sabane unheen kaarnon kaa vishleshan kiya tha jinka aaj kerala ke sandarbh main kar rahe hai
 What happened after the Chennai floods, did the river and pond land be liberated, the population removed from there, no
 to kya ham jaanboojh kar nadiyon ke raste main dub jane or mar jane ke liye nahin khadey hai
 The southernmost of the Western Ghats, passing through six states, is Kerala, from which 44 small big rivers originate
 inamen sabase lambii he periyar nadi
 In the devastation of Kerala, it is common knowledge that forests have been cut
 nadiyon ke maidan main atikaraman kar bastiyaan basaai gai hai
 If we look from one side, it will be clear that there was no flood in the river, settlements had settled in the floodplain, there was to be destruction
 ek video coimbatore se chalane vaale kowai post kii editor vidyashri dharmraj ne hamen di he
 Vidyashree is in Palakkad district house which was completely drowned
 yah ghar kalpaaki nadi ke kinare bana hua he yani nadi ke bahaav ke raste main
 Apparently the river was on its way, people were sitting on their way home
 system ne us vakt nahin dekha jab ghar ban rahe the
 If we do not flood ten or twenty years, then we become certain
 jab mallampura dam or walyar dam kaa pani bhar gaya to jaise hi pani choda gaya kalpaaki nadi kaa jalastr kaaphi bad gaya
 The result was devastation
 baari maatra main logon kii jamaa puunji nasht ho gai he
 Property is ruined
 isi tarah dhan ke kheton ko bhar kar makaan banaae gaye hai or banane die gaye hai
 The ponds have been filled
 abhi hamaare saamne is baat ke ricard nahin he ki kerala ke 80 se adhik dam kii aakhri baar safai kab hui thi
 The Government of Kerala should put a report before the public on which silt of which dam was cleaned
 dam kaa get kholaa gaya us vakt raste main aane vaali basti ko kis tarah se alert kiya gaya
 The official reply to all this should be awaited
 ab ham aate hai madhav gadgil report par
 This report came in 2011
 qareeb dedh saal ke vyapak adhyayan ke baad taiyaar gadgil report main puure pashchimi ghat ko ecologically sensitive ghoshit karne kii sifaarish kii gai thi
 For this, the Western Ghats were divided into three special Ecologically Sensitive Zones
 kaha gaya tha ki Ecologically Sensitive Zone 1 main badi storage vaala koi bhi nayaa baandh nahin banaaya janaa chahie
 Athirappilly and Gundia Hydel projects built in this area should not be given environmental clearance
 goa main padane vaale ESZ 1 or ESZ 2 main khanan se jude projects ko anishchit kaal ke liye manzuri na di jaae
 In ESZ 1 it was suggested to gradually stop mining by 2016
 jabaki ESZ 2 ke tahat aane vaale ilaakon main sakht niyamon or kadi nigaraanee ke tahat hi khanan kii baat kahi gai thi
 If the suggestions of this report were to be implemented, indiscriminate mining and construction work would be stopped in the entire area
 nadiyon ke kinare nirmaan nahin hota or betaratib tareeke se rihaishi ilaakon kaa vistaar nahin hota
 But the government did not accept this report
 ek or cameti bana di gai jo hamaare saamne kasturirangan report kii shakl main ai
 It relaxed a lot but none of the suggestions made in this report were implemented
 kasturirangan cameti kii report ke aadhaar par paryaavaran mantralay ne pashchimi ghat ke qareeb 57 hazaar varg kilometre ilaake ko hi paryaavaran ke lihaaz se samvedansheel mana
 Mining, large construction, thermal power plants, polluting industries were completely banned in this area
 kerala main iske tahat 13,108 varg kilometre main pabandi lagani thi lekin rajya sarkaar kii ore se aitaraaz kiye jane ke baad kerala kaa pashchimi ghat main padane vaala sirf 9994 varg kilometre ilaaka hi notiphoi kiya gaya
 That is why there is more negligence of governments than the floods of Kerala that do not destroy nature
 in jagahon par paryaavaran kaa jab bhi sawaal uthta he hameshaa mazaaq udaaya jaataa he ki vikaas kaa virodh karne vaale aa gaye

 kisi ne nahin sochaa tha ki pani unke ghar kii chat tak aa jayega kyonki ghar banane se pehle unhen kisi ne nahin bataaya tha ki nadiyon ke aas-paas ke ilaake bhar die gaye hai
 Water will come
 aaj nahin to das saal baad aayega magar barbaadi aegi
 This is recorded in thousands of articles and books of our experts

 There are many forms of wastage

 The role of nature in what has happened in Kerala is not as much as the failure of the system that does not control the greed of contractors and industrialists
 varna chennai se lekar kerala tak main ek hi pattern par tabaahi nahin aati
 If all of you accept that the destruction has come due to human lapses, the system has invited it, then should not every person affected by the flood be compensated

 The house is built on the banks of the Kalpaki River, that is, on the way to the river

 The system did not see when houses were being built
 das bees saal baadh nahin aati he to ham nishchit ho jate hai
 When the waters of Mallampura Dam and Wallair Dam were filled up, the water level of Kalpaki River increased significantly as soon as the water was released
 nateeja tabaahi
 The huge amount of people's accumulated capital has been destroyed
 sampatti barbaad ho gai he
 Similarly, houses have been built by filling paddy fields and allowed to be built
 talabon ko bharaa gaya he
 We do not yet have records of when more than 80 dams of Kerala were cleaned last
 kerala sarkaar ko baqayada public ke saamne yah report rakhni chahie ki kis dam ke gaad kii safai kab hui thi
 How was the gate of Dam opened at that time? in sabake aadhikarik jawaab kaa intazaar kiya janaa chahie
 Now we come to the Madhav Gadgil Report
 2011 main yah report aa gai thi
 The Gadgil report, prepared after an extensive study of about one and a half years, recommended the entire Western Ghats to be declared ecologically sensitive
 iske liye pashchimi ghat ko teen khaas Ecologically Sensitive Zones main baanta gaya tha
 It was said that no new dam with large storage should be built in Ecologically Sensitive Zone 1
 is ilaake main bane athirappilli or gundiya hidel projects ko paryaavaran manzuri nahin di jaani chahie
 Mining projects in ESZ 1 and ESZ 2 falling in Goa should not be granted indefinitely
 ESZ 1 main 2016 tak khanan ko dhire-dhire band kar diye jane kaa suzav diya gaya tha
 Whereas areas under ESZ 2 were said to be mined only under strict regulations and strict monitoring
 agar is report ke sujhaavon par amal hota to puure ilaake main andhadhundh khanan or nirmaan kaa kaam kaam ruk jaataa he
 Construction is not done on the banks of rivers and residential areas do not expand in a haphazard manner
 magar sarkaar ne is report ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Another committee was formed which came before us in the form of Kasturirangan report
 isane kaaphi kuch dheel de di lekin is report main bhi jo suzav die us par bhi kisi ne amal nahin kiya
 Based on the report of the Kasturirangan Committee, the Environment Ministry considered the area around 57 thousand square kilometers of the Western Ghats as environmentally sensitive
 is puure ilaake main khanan, bade nirmaan, thermal power plant, pradooshan failaane vaale udyogon par puri tarah pabandi lag gai
 In Kerala, under this, 13,108 sq km was to be banned, but after the state government objected to it, only 9994 sq km of the area falling in the Western Ghats of Kerala was notified
 isiilie kerala kii baadh jitani prakruti kii tabaahi nahin he usase kahin zyada sarkaron kii laaparvaahee he
 Whenever the question of environment is raised in these places, it is always mocked that those opposing development came
 bas logon ko mauka mil gaya or ve nadiyon ke kinare bastiyaan basaane lage
 More than 1 million people are displaced
 5645 raahat shivi banaae gaye hai
 3700 medical camps have been set up
 baahar ke rajyon se pine kaa pani laayaa ja rahaa he
 More than a million people are living in these camps
 mausam vibhaag kaa kahana he ki agle paanch dinon tak barish se raahat rahegi
 Except a few, there is no chance of strong rain like before
 pani peeche hatane se kai jagahon se shav milane lage hai
 Even after this, the system of electricity and water has not been restored
 20,000 karod se zyada kii barbaadi hui he
 No one thought that water would come to the roof of their house because nobody had told them before the house was built that the areas around the rivers had been filled
 pani aayega hi aayega
 Today if not then it will come after ten years but ruin will come
 yah baat hamaare jaankaron ke hazaron lekh or kitabon main darj he
 We neither read nor follow them before and after the flood
 barbaadi ke kai rup hai
 When the 19-year-old Kailash went home from a relief camp in Kozhikode district, he saw that his certificate had deteriorated in the flood waters
 use laga ki sab kuch barbaad ho gaya he
 He got hanged
 sarkaar ko turant is par logon ko bataanaa chahie ki aadhaar card, rashan card yaa sarkari dastauez ke kho jane yaa nasht ho jane par vah kya karne vaali he
 Meanwhile, a large number of common people are coming forward to help Kerala
 supreme court ke tamaam jaj apni ek maheene kii selary denge
 mps and mlas are also doing so
 kai rajyon ke iees afasar bhi apni selary kaa hissaa de rahe hai
 a student of Kerala 11th has given one acre of land to the Chief Minister Relief Fund
 swaha ne jo zamin daan main di he, bazaar main uski keemat 50 lakh bataai jaati he
 His peasant father had given his daughter an acre of land
 21 saal kii hanan ne machhlee bechakar apni padhai ke liye paise jamaa kiye the
 The abuses have given one and a half lakh rupees to the Chief Minister's Relief Fund
 kerala madad ke aise anek kisson se bharaa he
 Even after this, s Gurumurthy has been appointed as the director of the Reserve Bank of India
 unke ek twit par kaaphi vivaad ho rahaa he
 He tweeted that the Supreme Court judges would like to see if there is any connection between the floods in Kerala and what is happening in Sabarimala
 agar iskaa das lakh main ek chance bhi he to log nahin chahenge ki ayppan ke kilaaf cese kaa faisalaa ho
 Reserve Bank directors should do such things, it should be decided by the Reserve Bank of India how they can welcome their new directors with such thinking
 es gurumurti kii yah raay puraatanapanthi he
 The women of India are insulted
 kerala main jo bhi hua he, usamen prakruti kaa role utana nahin he jitna system kii us naakaami he jo thekedaaron or udyogpatiyon ke laalach par lagaam nahin laga paata he
 Otherwise, from Chennai to Kerala, there is no catastrophe on the same pattern
 agar yah baat aap sabhi sweekaar karte hai ki tabaahi insaani chook ke kaaran ai he, system ne ise nyauta diya he to kya baadh se prabhavit har vyakti ko muawza nahin milanaa chahie
 The right to compensation is a new idea in the field of disaster management
 jo dhire-dhire jagah le rahaa he
 Our colleague Himanshu Shekhar has read his dissertation at many places in the world regarding the right to compensation
 tippaniyan Due to the negligence and arbitrariness of our own governments, Kerala's largest Kochi International Airport has been closed due to this flood
 darasal ye hawaii adda periyar nadi kii ek sahaayak nadi chengal thodu ke flud plane main bana he
 When it was built in 1999, the Periyar River was just 400 meters away from it
 hawaondde ko banane ke liye periyar kii sahaayak nadi ke bade fladplan ko nirmaan se dabaa diya gaya
 When it was feared how the airport would survive the heavy rains, it was said that water could be controlled from the Mulla Periyar dam
 lekin is baar kii barish ne bataa diya ki baandh kii bhi ek kshamta hoti he or baandh kaa jalashay bharne par pani chhodana hi padataa he
 Why Kochi is also the airport in Chennai connected by the floodplain of the Adyar river
 disambar 2015 kii traasadee main chennai airport par bhi pani bhar gaya tha
 Not only this, Mumbai airport is also occupied by the floodplain of Mithi River
 26 july 2005 ko mumbai main baari barish ke baad mithi nadi isiilie overflo hui ki uske raste main jagah jagah aisa andhadhundh nirmaan ho chukaa tha jiske chalate nadi kaa pani samudr main nahin pahunch paaya
 The airport being built in Navi Mumbai is also going to be built in a large marshy area and for this the route of Ulwe river is also being diverted
 isi tarah dhan ke kheton ko bhar kar makaan banaae gaye hai or banane die gaye hai
 The ponds have been filled
 abhi hamaare saamne is baat ke ricard nahin he ki kerala ke 80 se adhik dam kii aakhri baar safai kab hui thi
 The Government of Kerala should put a report before the public on which silt of which dam was cleaned
 dam kaa get kholaa gaya us vakt raste main aane vaali basti ko kis tarah se alert kiya gaya
 The official reply to all this should be awaited
 ab ham aate hai madhav gadgil report par
 This report came in 2011
 qareeb dedh saal ke vyapak adhyayan ke baad taiyaar gadgil report main puure pashchimi ghat ko ecologically sensitive ghoshit karne kii sifaarish kii gai thi
 For this, the Western Ghats were divided into three special Ecologically Sensitive Zones
 kaha gaya tha ki Ecologically Sensitive Zone 1 main badi storage vaala koi bhi nayaa baandh nahin banaaya janaa chahie
 Athirappilly and Gundia Hydel projects built in this area should not be given environmental clearance
 goa main padane vaale ESZ 1 or ESZ 2 main khanan se jude projects ko anishchit kaal ke liye manzuri na di jaae
 In ESZ 1 it was suggested to gradually stop mining by 2016
 jabaki ESZ 2 ke tahat aane vaale ilaakon main sakht niyamon or kadi nigaraanee ke tahat hi khanan kii baat kahi gai thi
 If the suggestions of this report were to be implemented, indiscriminate mining and construction work would be stopped in the entire area
 nadiyon ke kinare nirmaan nahin hota or betaratib tareeke se rihaishi ilaakon kaa vistaar nahin hota
 But the government did not accept this report
 ek or cameti bana di gai jo hamaare saamne kasturirangan report kii shakl main ai
 It relaxed a lot but none of the suggestions made in this report were implemented
 kasturirangan cameti kii report ke aadhaar par paryaavaran mantralay ne pashchimi ghat ke qareeb 57 hazaar varg kilometre ilaake ko hi paryaavaran ke lihaaz se samvedansheel mana

 There is a lot of controversy over one of his tweets
 unhone twit kiya he ki supreme court ke jaj ye dekhnaa chahenge ki kerala kii baadh or sabarimala main jo ho rahaa he usamen kya koi conection he
 If it has a chance in one million people, then people will not want to decide the case against Ayyappan

 This opinion of S
 Gurumurthy is archaic

 The role of nature in what has happened in Kerala is not as much as the failure of the system that does not control the greed of contractors and industrialists
 varna chennai se lekar kerala tak main ek hi pattern par tabaahi nahin aati
 If all of you accept that the destruction has come due to human lapses, the system has invited it, then should not every person affected by the flood be compensated
 aapadaa prabandhan ke kshetra main muaavze kaa adhikaar ek nayaa vichaar he

 Actually, this airport is built in the Flood Plain of Chengal Thodu, a tributary of the Periyar River
 1999 main jab ye bana to periyar nadi isse sirf 400 meter dur thi
 The large floodplain of the Periyar tributary to build the airport was suppressed by construction
 jab ye ashanka jataai gai ki baari barish main hawaldda kaise bachegaa to kaha gaya ki mullah periyar baandh se pani par niyantran kiya ja saktaa he
 But this time the rain has told that the dam also has a capacity and water has to be released when the reservoir of the dam is filled
 kochi hi kyon chennai kaa hawaldda bhi adyar nadi ke fladplan se laga hua he
 The Chennai airport was also flooded in the December 2015 tragedy
 yahi nahin mumbai hawaii adda bhi mithi nadi ke fladplan par kabza kar bana hua he
 On 26 July 2005, after heavy rains in Mumbai, the Mithi river overflowed so that it was constructed indiscriminately on its way, due to which the water of the river could not reach the sea

 The Gadgil report, prepared after an extensive study of about one and a half years, recommended the entire Western Ghats to be declared ecologically sensitive

 is ilaake main bane athirappilli or gundiya hidel projects ko paryaavaran manzuri nahin di jaani chahie
 Mining projects in ESZ 1 and ESZ 2 falling in Goa should not be granted indefinitely
 ESZ 1 main 2016 tak khanan ko dhire-dhire band kar diye jane kaa suzav diya gaya tha
 Whereas areas under ESZ 2 were said to be mined only under strict regulations and strict monitoring
 agar is report ke sujhaavon par amal hota to puure ilaake main andhadhundh khanan or nirmaan kaa kaam kaam ruk jaataa he
 Construction is not done on the banks of rivers and residential areas do not expand in a haphazard manner
 magar sarkaar ne is report ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Another committee was formed which came before us in the form of Kasturirangan report
 isane kaaphi kuch dheel de di lekin is report main bhi jo suzav die us par bhi kisi ne amal nahin kiya
 Based on the report of the Kasturirangan Committee, the Environment Ministry considered the area around 57 thousand square kilometers of the Western Ghats as environmentally sensitive
 is puure ilaake main khanan, bade nirmaan, thermal power plant, pradooshan failaane vaale udyogon par puri tarah pabandi lag gai
 In Kerala, under this, 13,108 sq km was to be banned, but after the state government objected to it, only 9994 sq km of the area falling in the Western Ghats of Kerala was notified

 20,000 karod se zyada kii barbaadi hui he
 No one thought that water would come to the roof of their house because nobody had told them before the house was built that the areas around the rivers had been filled
 pani aayega hi aayega
 Today if not then it will come after ten years but ruin will come
 yah baat hamaare jaankaron ke hazaron lekh or kitabon main darj he
 We neither read nor follow them before and after the flood
 barbaadi ke kai rup hai
 When the 19-year-old Kailash went home from a relief camp in Kozhikode district, he saw that his certificate had deteriorated in the flood waters
