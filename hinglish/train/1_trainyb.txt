 He spoke openly on the current politics of Bihar and the Center, socialist ideology and the politics of Narendra Modi
 padhein unase baatcheet:aapane kya khoyaa ? kya paaya ?raajnneeti main paane kii ichha nahin honi chahie
 From student life itself, i joined social ideology, in which ideology is everything
 jepi movement main jab bhaag liya tab to sochaa bhi nahin tha ki kabhi chunaav ladenge
 The specialty of today's power politics is the difference between statement and action
 kuch bhi kah do taaki vot mil jaae
 We have never thought like this, there is no sorrow of losing anything
 ye samaj nahin aayaa ki aapako bijepi manjuur he, lekin modi nahin?agar koi samajhnaa chaahe to samaj jayega
 Cooperated with BJP
 bihar main parivartan kii javaabadari lee
 But people ignore the basic difference
 1995 main bijepi kaa sammelan mumbai main tha
 It was in Mumbai that i spoke to advani-atalji
 hamaare bich gathbandhan kii baat hui or tay hua ki vivaadit teen mudde alag rakhe jaaen
 Our constitutional values were always protected under the leadership of Advani and Atal ji
 lekin ab jo baat he vah samaaj ko baantne kii baat he
 Regardless from above, everyone's development is with everyone
 ab sirf ek netaa nahin, puri party kattarpanth kii ore ja rahi he
 It was not difficult for me to decide
 ham koi sarkari naukari karne nahin aae
 It was wrong to stay together just to stay in power
 hamane bihar main koshish kii he kanoon kaa raaj kaayam karne kii or aise kadam uthaane kii jisase bihar ke log rajya ke baahar majaak kaa paatr na bane
 You are running the tape of Modi, but in the election, the BJP will play your tape, in which you are saying that under the rule of Lalu was the rule of the jungle? Not the jungle, the secret of terror
 jangal main to bhi niyam hote hai
 But we worked to fix this
 lekin ab koi yah nahin kah saktaa he ki ham bijepi se samjhaute banaae rakhen or unki galat baat maanate rahen
 i am addicted to speaking less
 kaam karne main vishwaas karata hum
 First the girls are not able to take the bicycles to the market, till 9 o'clock, the markets are open very comfortably
 koi kahin bhi aa ja saktaa he
 But heard that the terror of the Yadavas is again dominating? Our government is running with the support of the RJD, but now Bihar is not going to return to the old times
 aapaki aguwai main chunaav lada jayega bihar main ?agar janata hamen chunati he to logon kii buniyadi baaten hi aage kii jaaengi
 Right now we are running the government from remote? We were running a direct government
 chunaav ke baad kaha gaya ki mujhe istipha dena chahie
 They did not know that i would resign
 ab jab maine khud satta chhodi he to remote kii baat bemaani he
 Are RJD and JDU merging in Bihar? Who will be the leader? Will sit together, it can happen if we talk
 pehle sab saath the
 Who will be the leader will decide the party to be formed
 aapane dilli main raily kii thi, jo bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja de degaa ham uske saath ho jaaenge ?hamane ye kaha tha ki jo netaa bihar se chun kar jaaen, unhen ye mudda bananaa chahie ki jo bihar ko special darja de use samarthan denge
 So if Modi fulfills this demand, he has said this in his speech
 ab tak unhen ye kaam kar dena chahie
 But they are cutting the already approved package
 to chunaav modi ke audio teps par ladaa jayega?bilkul
 what's wrong with that
 ye to raajnneeti ke str ko upar uthaane vaali baat he
 We will not make unrestrained allegations
 lekin yah to bataaenge ki is baat kii kathani-kerani main antar he
 People are waiting, bring black money and put whatever 15-20 lakhs were on your account
 inaki sachai dekhe, ye 85 pratishat hindu bahusnkhyakon ko 15 pratishat alpsankhyakon se darawa rahe hai
 Do you believe that Modi won the battle of ideology in the 2014 elections? Even if we deny it, someone will agree
 lekin vichaardhaara kabhi nahin harati
 We were not able to keep our point properly, they were successful in giving them their point
 haalanki unhen sirf 31 pratishat vot mila he, lekin hamaara system he first past da post ij vinar
 Kalyan Singh, President of Rashtriya Jan Kranti Party and former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, called upon the people, accusing the Congress, BJP, BSP and SP of indulging in corruption, that they can use their voting power to change the future of the country

 i keep listening to this joke on the day to come
 kai baar lagata he ki ham kisi jumale ko bina soche samajhe sweekaar kar lete hai
 Since time immemorial Delhi and heart have been jolted listening to jumle
 yah dilli dil se kya hota he
 Who is so confident in the heart of Delhi
 kya isliye ki dilli ke naam par dil he
 But Delhi is not built by heart
 dehali se bani he
 What the sill is made of is a different subject
 lekin netaaon or sloganbazon ne chupake se is dilli main dil thel diya
 Throwed, then pushed
 dil se kisi ko kya dikkat, lekin dil dil dil diladilaane se ub honi lagi he
 When it is happening for the whole of India, what is the need of the heart for Delhi separately
 kya madhyapradesh yaa uttar pradesh yaa bihar ke liye dil kii zarurat nahin he
 Slogan should also have a limit
 saamaan bechney ke slogan ko aaj raajnneeti main laate hai wo khokhla lagata hai
 Yes, these days there are many political buyers of such slogans and they are also sold
 epa em radio se lekar tivi or sadakon par lage hording main aksar dil or dilli ko milakar banaae jumale dekhtaa rahata hum
 This relationship is so worn out that at least i don't care
 ye vaise he jaise naye saal ke greeting card par kuch jumale likhe chale aa rahe hai
 We are being held without burping them
 dilli dil se ek bakawaas jumala he
 Just like happy new year or happy or happy new year for you
 ham sabaki kalpanashiltaa or rachanaatmakataa kund ho gai he
 No one knows exactly what is auspicious and what is new, but everyone is passing this jumla to each other
 dil se dilli yaa dilli dil se
 There is no difference between the two
 is dilli main bhayanak akelaapan badhata ja rahaa he
 The struggle to meet their basic needs is becoming complex
 aakhir duniya ke kis shahar se behatar ban jaae dilli
 Why become
 dilli dilli kyon na rahe
 Seeing which cities of the world become like Delhi
 duniya ke har behtareen shahar main garibi kaa vahi sankat he jisaki tarah netaa dilli ko banane kaa jhootha sapana dikhaa rahe hai
 It is not about making Delhi
 baat he us saamaajik aarthik vyavastha ko banane ki jahaan hamaari aapaki zindagi surakshit ho
 Is anyone making such an arrangement? ye puuchhiye netaa se
 Get rid of such rites, whether it be pride or heart
 hindustan ke shaharon ko aap yahaan kii ravaayat ke hisaab se banaaiye
 Both great and better
 jab dilli paris jaisi ho jaae or patna venice jaisaa to vahaan se koi yahaan kyon dekhne jayega
 Everything is becoming a tag line
 tag line rachanaatmakataa se paidaa hone vaali kabad he
 Look at the hoardings
 ek hording main kai tarah kii tag line thuns di gayi hai
 Many faces are smiling with a smile that you are welcome from New Year to Lohri
 kyon he bhai swaagat
 Did we say that socialists, bjpers, Congressmen all welcome you
 dekho bhul mat janaa
 If you are not welcome, these Teej festivals of India will become desolate
 tyoharon ke naam par jo slogan kachra paidaa ho rahaa he wo bhayanak he
 Slogan-garbage is like e-waste
 laal batti par khvaamkhaah in hording ko dekhakar dimag bhannata rahata he
 Now more than the excitement about the Republic Day, this fear settles down that at the next light, another Pappu Guddu will be giving the greetings of the Republic Day
 badhai ke poster main apane do chaar bade netaaon ko bhi upar kone main thele rahata he
 Pappu does not say what he has done for the Republic, but Chalo Bhai is congratulating him for what it is
 ganatantr diwas par isse acha ahsaan kya ho saktaa he ki shahar ke chappe chappe ko kacharamay kar do or badhai de do
 Congratulations on spreading garbage in which city of the world have you seen? aae din nigam vaale aisi hording hataate rahete hai, lekin hording vaale hai ki aapaki ankhon main thelne ke liye kahin bhi khadey ho jate hai
 One day our politics will declare the corporation as anti-republic
 dilli ke nizamuddin pul se guzar ke dekhiye
 Do not understand whether to see the car in front or hoarding
 isliye raajnneeti main sochane kii kriya ko protsaahit kiijie
 First, clear the motive of what to do with heart for Delhi
 sadak banani he to wo bina dil ke bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 You can also do college without heart
 bas dimaag or bajet kii zarurat he
 Yes, if you put your heart to all these works then the public will be benefited
 janata to vot de hi detii he janaab
 But you do not attach your heart
 dimag vahaan laga dete hai taaki koi jaan hi na paae ki in hording vigyaapan main lagane vaala dhan kahaan se aayaa
 Where did the money come from to transport thousands of people to the rally
 kisi ko kuch pataa nahin he ki raajnneeti main ho kya rahaa he
 Just give heart aise kaise dil de den
 Let us know whether Mehboob is worthy of our heart or not
 isliye in sloganon se bachiye
 You see the issue
 dilli dil se koi mudda nahin he
 There was no difference between soap and political party advertising
 raajnneeti satta or samaaj ko badalane kaa zariyaa he
 Argue what someone is talking about in this direction from the heart
 koi dil se kya kar rahaa he
 If we talk about the heart, it will not be that this heart is of Hindu and that heart is of Muslim
 ye pakistan kaa wo hindustan kaa
 Heart is for humanity
 ek aisa samaaj banane ke liye jahaan ham dil kii baat kah saken
 You can listen to the heart and do not hurt anyone's heart, but for this only Delhi is the only Dilwali, this thing is useless
 koi bhi shahar dilavaala ho saktaa he
 From the heart you can work from Goa to Gujarat and Arunachal to Tripura
 isliye pleez polytics ko is dilbaazi se dur rakhiye
 Ask what has happened and why it is not happening
 kyon garib haashiye par ja rahaa he, naukariyaan nahin hai, phir is mandi main bhi raajnneetik dalon ke paas vigyaapan or mahangi reliyon ke liye paise kii kami nahin he
 Where have all these things come from? Ask them also from the heart

 If the 2014 election results are considered the basis, then the BJP candidate's victory from the sp-congress is only 4
 4% kaa banataa he or matadaataaon ke mood main halke se badlaav se baaji palat sakati he
 Arjun Chaudhary, a resident of Mont, says, “the caste equations have changed in 2017 compared to 2014
 is baar maant vidhaan sabha kshetra main 3 party ummidavaaron ke bich main jat vot bant rahaa he''
 His friend Lakshmi Narayan Tiwari says, "demonetisation is an election issue this time in Manat
 kisaan is ilaake main notebandi ke dauraan pareshaan hue
 " is chunaav kshetra main jat voters ek lakh se zyada hai or is baar congress-sapa gathbandhan or rashtriya lokdal ne jat ummidavaaron ko yahaan chunaav maidan main utaara he, jabaki bijepi ne is baar esake sharma or basapa ne maant ke 7 baar ke vidhayak shyaam sundar sharma ko ummidavaar banaaya he
 Both are from Brahmin community

 There is resentment among the people that governments have focused only on the development of selected areas of Mathura district, whereas the needs of the mont have been ignored in the last few years
 maant nivasee bhagava swaroop kehete hai, "maant kshetra kii kisi ko phikr nahin he
 It has never been developed here
 " jabaki kaushal kishor sharma kehete hai, "hamane hema malini ko yahaan se jitayaa, lekin phir bhi yahaan kuch nahin badla he"
 In such a situation, changing the mood of only a quarter to two percent of the voters can reverse the results
 maant nivasee arjuna choudhary kehete hai, "2014 ke mukaable 2017 main jaateey sameekaran badale hai
 This time, Jat is distributing votes among 3 party candidates in the constituency of the Mont Legislative Assembly

 Former Union Minister and senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad belongs to Kashmir
 kashmir main baadh or bachaav kaary par unhone grih mantri rajnath singh se mulaakaat kar ghati main raahat kaary tej karne kii maang kii
 After the meeting, Gulaam Nabi Azadne held a special conversation and expressed his opinion on the situation in Kashmir
 sawaal-grih mantri se aap mili, kya baaten huin aapaki unase?jawaab-baaki chizon ke bare main unhen jaankaree he hi, is vakt praathamikta he ki pani nikaala jaae or logon kii jaan bachaai jaae
 Till now, there was no scope to remove the 8-10 feet of water which has entered the colonies, because the water level of Jhelum had increased
 uske flud channel kaa level badha tha lekin ab unke aas-paas ke ilaakon se pani nikaal kar dariyaa main daalaa ja saktaa he
 The pumps we had were drowned in water, rotting, so i requested them to bring de-watering pumps from other parts of the country to Kashmir
 doosraa, pani nikalne ke baad 4-5 feet tak keechad bachegaa, use nikaalane ke liye mashine mangai jaaen taaki keechad bhi nikaala jaae
 Question- What difficulties will come after the release of water? Answer - The biggest difficulty that will come now is that diseases will spread a lot
 bade paimaane par mahamari kaa dar he
 i told the Health Minister and his senior officials a few days ago that 2-3 thousand doctors will have to be arranged
 apane str par maine jitani bhi dawa companiyaan hai unase dawa ke liye guzarish kii he, hyderabad or bengalooru se doctors ko kashmir bhejne kii koshish kii he, wo ab janaa shuru ho gaye hai, to ab hamako deshbhar se doctors vahaan bhejne honge
 So that the incoming difficulty can be dealt with
 sawaal-airforce or army ke log vahaan rescue karte hue dikh rahe hai, unki tarif ho rahi he
 But politicians and others are not visible? Answer - We all, people from across the country are praising the Army and the NDRF, but i am very sorry that thousands of local youth, ngos, political parties, whether they are mainstream Whether it is small parties or working with their thousands of workers in the field
 lungar khol rahe hai, davaaiyaan pahunchaa rahe hai
 Reaching door to door
 local noujvaan jinka kisi raajnneetik party se sambandh nahin he wo daravaaje nikaal kar, khidkiyaan nikaalkar, almariyaan tod kar boat bana rahe hai
 Using tires
 yani jo kuch bhi pani main tair sakati he uskaa istemaal kar hajaaron jaanon ko bachaa chuke hai
 But these things are not coming out
 kuch isliye saamne nahin aa rahi hai ki unhen dikhaaya nahin jaataa
 i regret that it is being done deliberately that the local people and local parties working are not shown to them
 main khud nau din se vahaan hum, maine 4-5 darjan se zyada bits deen lekin kahin nahin dikhaai gayi
 Yes, if you go to the helicopter, you will definitely be shown
 lekin agar aap jameen par kaam karoge, to nahin
 Thousands of people and institutions, teams are working on the ground from our side, whose work is not being shown
 army or airforce ke kaam ki ham bhi tahe dil se tarif karte hai, lekin meri mediakarmiyon se guzarish he ki jis tarah se unke kaam kii saraahna ho rahi he usee tarah se jo local sansthaaen kaam kar rahi hai unki bhi saraahna honi chahie

 The Indian team has been successful in reaching the semi-finals of the World Cup for the third consecutive time
 england and wales main jari is vishwa cap-2019 main bharat ko pehle semifinal main mangalvaar ko newjiland se bhidana he
 Opening Rohit Sharma has been an important contributor to India in the semi-finals
 rohit ne abhi tak aath maichon main paanch shatakon kii madad se 647 ran banaae hai
 Kohli is hopeful that this Mumbai batsman will score a century in the next two matches as well and lead India to the World Cup
 match se pehle kohli ne kaha, 'ek captain ke taur par maine is vishwa cap main jis tarah kaa role nibhaayaa he wo acha he
 i am ready to play every role that the team wants from me
 yah acha he ki rohit nirantar acchhee ballebaaji kar rahaa he
 This means that due to being late in the innings, i have to play a slightly different role which is to handle the middle overs and leave Hardik Pandya, Kedar Jadhav, Dhoni free to play their game
 'captain ne kaha, 'nijee record aise hai ki jin par koi khilaadi dhyaan nahin detaa
 Rohit also said the same after the last match
 vah sirf apana sarvshereshth dene kii koshish kar rahaa he or is prakriya main vishesh chijen ho rahi hai
 Kohli has also scored five consecutive fifties in this World Cup
 kohli or rohit chahenge ki unki yah form 14 july tak jari rahe
 He said, 'so i think in team sport you need to keep pace with things
 main is baat se khush hum ki main aisa kar rahaa hum or main ummid karata hum ki vah do or shatak jamaayenge taaki ham do or match jeet saken
 This would be great availability
 maine kabhi nahin dekha ki kisi ne ek toornament main paanch shatak jamaaye hai
 There is more pressure in the World Cup and here they are playing well
 mere hisaab se ve vishwa ke sheersh vanade khilaadi hai
 When Kohli was asked more in-depth about his role, he said, "I have understood that your role can change in odis, it depends on what time you are going to bat
" main ek chor pakad kar khush hum or duusare khilaadiyon ko 150, 160 or 200 tak pahunchate dekhnaa chahta hum
 In the end i can score fast
 'kohli ne saath hi mana ki newjiland ke gendbaajon kaa saamana karnaa aasaan nahin hoga, khaskar jab tab mausam kharaab ho
 Kohli said, 'new Zealand bowling attack has always been balanced
 unke tej gendbaaj nirantar acha pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Mitchell Santner is taking a lot of control from his ability in the middle overs
 wo ek aisi team he jo hameshaa se nirantar acha karti ai he
 So we know that we have to be very disciplined in front of him as well as playing the right cricket because he is bowling on good line and length
 'kohli se jab bharat ke gendbaaji akraman ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'mere hisaab se, hamaara gendbaaji akraman agar is toornament main sarvshereshth nahin he to uske kareeb to he

 This task force will also keep an eye on the preparations for the next Olympics to be held in Tokyo and strategize to bring maximum medals to the players
 rio olympic main bharat kaa pradarshan pichhali baar kii tulana main behad kharaab rahaa he
 Compared to 2 silver and 4 bronze medals last time, we have had to be satisfied with only one silver and one bronze medal this time
 aise main bhartiya dal ke pradarshan kii samiksha karne ke bajaay ham jashn main duube hai
 Medal winning players like Kubera have been kind to him
 sarkaron ne ophers kii barsaat kar di he
 Just think, what would have happened if one gold had come apart from Silver and Bronze? Badminton player PV Sindhu, who won the silver medal in the multi-million rainbow on Sindhu and Sakshi Malik, who won a bronze medal in wrestling, have become millionaires
 iske alaava sarkari naukariyon, ghar, jameen or mahangi car ke ofer bhi mili hai
 Sakshi is also promoted by Sakshi Malik of Haryana
 malik ko railway ne pramotion dekar gajeted afasar bana diya
 Apart from this, the Delhi government also offered to promote Sakshi's father Sukhbir Malik, who is a bus conductor in DTC
 in sabake alaava sindhu or sakshi ke saath-saath do or khilaadiyon ko khel ratna aword bhi diya jayega jinhone olympic main padak to nahin hasil kiya lekin acha pradarshan kiya
 
 
 
 par taiyaariyon ke samay nahin kholaa khajaanayaha gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki olympic main medal jeetne vaale khilaadiyon ko milane vaali inaam kii raashi khelon ke is mahakumbh ke aayojan ke liye taiyaariyon par kii jane vaali rakam se zyada hoti he
 That is, the amount of money that is rewarded on them is not even spent in their training
 agar training par or dhyaan diya jaae or khel sanghon ko raajnneeti se mukt kar diya jaae to sthiti behatar hoti or ek-ek padak ke liye tarasna nahin padataa
 Lots of money was spent here 
 
 
 UK Sport earmarked $ 350 million for Olympic preparations between 2013-17, while the Government of India gave $ 500 million or Rs 3,200 crore to the Youth Affairs and Sports budget
 agar is rakam kii tulana britain ke khel dhaancha or prashikshan ke salanaa khel bajet se karen to yah teesraa hissaa hi baithti he
 UK sports budget 1
 5 arab dollar yaa 9000 karod rupee tha
 Britain won 4 out of 67 medals in each medal
 1 million pound (36 karod se bhi zyada) kii rakam kharch kii
 At the same time, he spent 275 million pounds on preparing for the 2016 Rio Olympics
 vahiin, bharat ke 117 khilaadiyon main se sirf do ne tamge paae

 Chinese media says that India spends very little on sports infrastructure so it lags behind in big and competitive sports
 kaam chahie to kuch kadak hona hi padeganorth korea main rio olympic main khaali haath lautne vaale khilaadiyon kii to jaise shamat aa gai he

 yahi nahin, aise khilaadiyon ko rashan card sahit kai suvidhaon se bhi haath dhonaa pad saktaa he
 It is being told that Kim Jong had given the target of 17 medals to those going to the Olympics, but only 7 medals could come
 thodi si sikh inase bhi le lijie
 
 
 
 haalanki, duniyabar ke tamaam desh olympic se medal lekar laute apane khilaadiyon ko inaam or bonus dete hai
 The Singapore government gave a prize of 1 million Singapore dollars to Joseph Schooling, who overtook Michael Phelps to give his country the first gold
 haalanki iskaa 20 fisadi hissaa khel ke vikaas par kharch hoga
 On the other hand, the bonus amount is already fixed for the American players who win the most medals
 vahaan kii olympic cameti bonus ke taur par gold laane vaale ko 25 hajaar dollar, silver jeetne vaale ko 15 hajaar dollar jabaki bronj paane vaale ko 10 hajaar dollar detii he
 But here much more is spent on training of players
 yoga ke liye kranti ho sakati he to phir iske liye kyon naheembharat ko inase sikh lene kii jarurat he
 In the absence of medals in the Olympics, more should be spent on its preparations than on making a ruckus
 sarkaar ko champion kii talash kerani chahie or ise aage badhaane ke liye use tamaam sansaadhan muhaiyaa karaae jane chahie
 If there is a campaign on yoga in India, then why can't the mission for the Olympics be started
 agar bhartiya khel prashasan abhi se jaag jaataa he to 2020 ke tokyo olympic main to nahin lekin uske baad 2024 main hone vaale olympic khelon main padakon kii barish hona tay he

 Smriti Irani's body was not left untouched by the degree and Sanskrit controversy that she has given critics another chance
 ek jyotishi ko haath dikhaakar desh kii maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri smriti irani vivaadon main aa gai hai
 Smriti reached astrologer Nathulal Vyas in Bhilwara, Rajasthan on Sunday night and asked her future
 soshal media par kai log unke is ravaiye ko 'avaigyanik' bataakar aalochana kar rahe hai
 Many people have written on Facebook and Twitter that instead of promoting scientificity, the education minister of the country is engaging in superstitious rituals
 maamle par safai dete hue smriti irani ne sirf itnaa kaha ki unke paas apni janmapatri tak nahin he
 He gave an absurd statement while clarifying the matter
 unhone kaha, 'main vyaktigat jivan main kya kar rahi hum, isse aapaki tiarapy badhati he or aapako munafa hota he to thik he
 But if my personal work is not affected by my political life, then i do not think you will benefit from showing something like this
 'GDP badhaane ko irani kaa nayab fundagauratlab he ki ravivaar ko kendriya mantri pati jubin ke saath jyotishi nathulaal vyas ke paas pahunchin
 She stayed here for about four hours and asked questions about her future
 vyas ne smriti irani ko bataaya ki aane vaale samay main unke or oonchi kursi par jane kii sambhaavna he
 According to sources, the astrologer also told Smriti that she can also get the distinction of becoming the youngest President of the country in three to four years
 sutron kii maane to vyas ne smriti ko mahamrityunjay mantra kaa jaap karne ke liye bhi kaha he
 On the matter, Minority Affairs Minister Najma Heptulla said that astrology is an ancient science and it is a personal matter for Smriti Irani
 vahiin uma bharti ne muskuraate hue sirf itnaa kaha, 'main is par itnaa hi kahuungi kii main kuch nahin kahuungi
 However, voices of criticism are coming from the opposition parties
 congress netaa manishankar ayyar ne kaha, 'main unako badhai duungaa
 i would like to say that the education minister of the country should rely on science and not on superstition
 ' vahiin bispi supremeo mayawati ne kaha ki vah khud jyotish par yakeen nahin rakhti, lekin vah kisi kii nijee chizon par tippanee nahin karengi
 She has visited Nathulal Vyas twice before
 vyas ne pehle bhi unke pramotion kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi, jo sach sabit hui
 Smriti Irani's visit to an astrologer is also important because her name is in the news about the bjp's chief ministerial candidate in Delhi
 gauratlab he ki nathulaal vyas hi vah jyotishi hai jinke paas purv raashtrapati pratibha patil jaaya karti thim
 Patil became President only after Vyas's prediction
 jyotishi vyas kisi sawaal ke jawaab main bolte nahin hai, chock se slate par likhakar jawaab dete hai
 Delhiites may get a shock of inflation in the upcoming budget of Kejriwal government
 darasal is saal dilli kii waite se kamai ummid se kaaphi kam hui he
 Therefore, the tax department has sent a proposal to the government to increase VAT on many goods
 kejariwal sarkaarane vaale bajet main kai saamaanon par waite kii daren badhaane ke prastaav par muhar laga sakati he
 According to the sources of the department, to increase the earnings, the list of goods, which has been sent by the Trade and Tax Department of Delhi to the government, includes clothes, alcohol, tobacco, UPS, some plastic items and flour
 yadi sarkaar ne vibhaag kaa prastaav mana to mahangaai main logon kaa aataa bhi geela ho saktaa he
 Delhi's biggest source of earnings is VAT (VAT), from which the government earns more than half of its budget
 lekin is saal 24 hajaar karod ke lakshya se kam ab tak mahaj lagbhag 19 hajaar karod kii hi kamai ho pai he
 While there is less than 15 days left for the year to end
 sutara bataate hai ki tred or tex vibhaag ne jo prastaav pichley maheene sarkaar ke paas bheja usamen 200 rupee prati varg meter mahange kapade, gehun or chaaval kaa aataa, 2000 rupee se mahange radimaid kapade or plastic par paanch fisadi tak waite lagane kaa prastaav laayaa ja saktaa he
 There is no VAT on all this now
 vahiin inwarter par waite 5 fisadi se badhaakar saadhe baarah fisadi karne kaa prastaav bhi tex vibhaag ne sarkaar ke paas bheja he
 There is also a proposal to increase VAT on tobacco and alcohol from the present 20 per cent to 25 per cent
 gauratlab he ki pichley saal dilli ke bajet main kisi bhi saamaan par waite kii dar nahin badhaai gai thi
 But according to the sources, the final decision on VAT rates will be at the top level in government
 mumkin he ki bajet main tred or tex vibhaag ke in prastaavon main kuch ko badal diya jaae

 rahul gandhi kii vaapasi par lagaataar duusari baar kendrit is stambh kii vajah yah nahin he ki unhone koi bahut bada asar paidaa kar diya he
 This remains to be seen in the coming months
 masalaa unke kahe se judaa he, vishesh taur par sansad main die apane pehle bhaashan main jo baat unhone kahi thi usase, basharte vah puri gambhirtha se kahi gai ho
 Whether mocking Modi with his now-infamous 'suit-boot' or commenting on the celebrated celebration of Modi's sputters and internet supporters over Obama's appreciation in Time magazine, all of this goes on in parliamentary politics
 unhone isse aage haalanki yah kah diya tha ki america unheen videshi netaaon kii saraahna karte hai jo unke graahak hote hai
 Counting such names, he cited Gorbachev and said that he helped America by disintegrating Russia
 baahar lage camaron par die apane sankshipt bayaan main unhone america raashtrapati ke chaheton main boris yeltsin kaa naam bhi jod diya kyonki unhone rus ke udyogon kaa nijeekaran kiya tha
 Many questions are being raised on how these incidents were re-counted so long ago
 masalan, rahul itihaas ke apane sabak kahaan se le rahe hai? ve jo kah rahe hai, kya ve usamen vaaki vishwaas karte hai or agar nahin, to kya unhen is baat kaa ilm nahin ki ve desh kii duusari sabase badi party ke netaa hai or unhen pichley jamaane ke ke

 Do they really believe that Mikhail Gorbachev was an American puppet, a traitor, not a global leader who not only put an end to the unjust war in Afghanistan but made the way for the colonized Soviet 'republics' to regain independence? Similarly, do they believe that Yeltsin, who consumed too much vodka, was also an American agent? Let us ask a more sharp question: does Rahul Gandhi consider the fall of the Berlin Wall good or bad? Was this incident a big leap in the direction of humanity and freedom, or the surrender of a more noble faction in the Cold War, which hurt India? i am asking this question in such a jumbled manner, because i am amazed that Its implications are not being taken seriously, especially because their statements themselves are being taken as jumle
 agar ve roosi samrajya ke patan par vilaap kar hi rahe hai to unhen leonid brikenev ke yogadan ko yaad karnaa chahie
 He invaded Afghanistan and destroyed the power of Russia by doing so, as many excellent historians believe, including Niall Ferguson
 congress jab kabhi sankat main hoti he, america ko pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup main dosha dena or us par hamalaa karnaa uski ek aajamaai hui puraani ranneeti he

 He said that there has been a long time in history when the relationship between India and America has been strong

 Especially that visionary statement must be read in which they are saying that seeds of destruction exist within the ideology of communism
 yahaan tak ki america ne jab sheet yuddh ke dauraan pakistan ko apane gathjod main khinch liya, tab bhi bharat rus kii taraf nahin jhukaa tha
 All our weapons were still being purchased from Britain and France

 Despite this, in 1962 against China and in 1965 against Pakistan, all our military equipment was ordered from the west

 Menon left the shigufa of domestic manufacturing to win the plea of getting a mig plane from Russia instead of the US, but when the war broke out in 1965, the first mig squadron was still being built and it had only nine aircraft

 Until the sixties American peace activists were welcomed in India
 indira gandhi ke 1971 ke baad hue vam jhukaav ke chalate yah tasviir badalane lagi
 Soon the fruits of the Green Revolution also began to emerge which reduced the need for food cooperation
 bharat or america ke rishte sirf ek baar 1971 kii jang ke vakt kharaab hue jab nicksan-kisinger se duuri banaate hue bharat ne moscow ke saath paraspar ranneetik sandhi par dastakhat kar die
 He was forced to resort to foreign (american) help as Indira Gandhi became disillusioned with the rising inflation and economic recession following the war
 rishton main jami barf bahut baad main pighali jab janata party satta main ai or jimi carter rajkeey daure par bharat aae
 The atmosphere, however, was somewhat mixed as it was the time when Coke and IBM were expelled by George Fernandez as Industry Minister

" " main aaj unheen kii pankti kaa istemaal unke netaa rahul gandhi par sawaal khadaa karne ke liye kar rahaa hum
 If the appreciation of an American President is a stain for an Indian Prime Minister, this will also have to be told in the context of three generations of the nehru-gandhi family
 nehru ke sabhi america samakalinon ne unhen ek vaishvik rajaneta kaa darja diya or pashchimi jagat main unka kad bharat ke kad se kahin zyada bada tha
 Similarly, leaving Nixon alone, Indira was praised by everyone and since then, especially in view of the rise of India in the era of economic reforms, Henry Kissinger has been repeatedly regretting it
 iske alaava, haalia udghaatan (gairi gas kii da blad telegram or shrinath raghavan kii 1971) bharat kii ranneetik baadhyataaon ko bataate hai ki kaise china ke prati nicksan-kisinger kii naram niti ne indira ke paas koi vikalp hi nahin choda tha
 i told in an earlier column how Indira Gandhi herself tried to fix it after 1980

 If Rahul tells the strong team of Congress intellectuals to filter the old records, then his smartphone will be filled with links to far more passionate appreciation of his ancestors by the American Presidents
 unhen yah bhi pataa chalegaa ki manmohan singh samet bharat ke lagaataar teen pradhanmantriyon or unke america samakakshon ne ek-duusare ko ranneetik saajheedaar ke taur par dekha he
 Manmohan Singh had publicly told George Bush how much he wanted people in India

 When Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao and her Pakistani counterpart Salman Bashir meet again in the next few days, they will confirm this
 bharat-pakistan vaarta ke bare main ati gopneey baat yah he ki baat karne ke liye koi baat hi nahin bachi he
 Both countries are acutely aware of basic realities: that war is not an option to resolve a dispute between nuclear powers

 They realize, even if they do not openly admit it, that the geography of the map of Kashmir cannot be changed and all the trifles are concocted for domestic sentiment, not for international flattery
 yah baat bharat se zyada pakistan par lagu hoti he, kyonki bharat yathasthiti se santusht he or ise kisi samjhaute kaa aadhaar bananaa maan legaa
 Pakistan, authoritatively, could not do this, but in the much-hyped 'musharraf formula', in fact, the presumption was that the only solution would probably be to eliminate claims by adding one or two joules to an agreement and institutionalize the ground reality You have to give form
 ghoshit or aghoshit yudhon ke chah dashak seemaa ko chah inch bhi idhar-udhar nahin kar sake hai, or aisa agle chah dashak main bhi nahin ho sakegaa

 But since the meeting of foreign secretaries is more important than the breakfast of the foodies, here is a suggestion without asking
 agar ve ek jude hue lakshya ke agenda par sahamat hon,to ve log apane raajnneetik aakaaon ke liye kuch upyogi, vaastavik or vyaavhaarik kaam kar sakate hai: vah yah ki dakshes ko garibi virdohi pranali main or vichaaron kii ek aisi dhuree main kaise badla jaae jo vichaar vastuon, sevaaon or vitt ke agar unmukt nahin, to lochapurna vyapaar ke jariye gatisheel aarthik sambandhon ko sthapit karte hon
 India and Pakistan have trapped the SAARC countries in the vicious cycle that they have created through their unilateral conflicts
 jaisi ki ek sufi kahawat he, jab aap kisi dushchakr main kaid ho jaaen, to ek bada chakra bana len
 The SAARC is a major cycle through which the idea of the next decade can be prioritized that the economic upliftment of more than half a billion people living below the poverty line

 The nuclear crescent sweeps across Asia

 Surely the time has come for a summit on nuclear security, and why did such proposals come up through india-pakistan cooperation? If these two rivals form a common goal, it will help them to create conditions to create a new environment in an area far beyond their scope
 maujuuda vivaad, chaahe kitne bhi betuke hon, kitne bhi puraane yaa nae hon, us sahyog main baadha banane jaruri nahin hai jahaan vah sambhav he
 For poverty alleviation or environmental protection, India and Pakistan do not have to agree on an old wound like Kashmir, or a fresh dispute like Afghanistan

 To this end, some of us leaders — the names i have mentioned — can travel all over India and convince the people of the country, as there is no JP (jayaprakash Narayan) today
 'pavaar ne kaha ki sabhi vipakshi dalon ko rashtriya str par laana sambhav nahin he
 In such a situation, we are trying for an alliance at the state level itself

 Pawar said that he had recently met Mayawati
 unhone samaajawaadee party or anya logon ke saath upi main majbootee ke saath gathbandhan karne kii baat kahi
 Mayawati expects other parties in other states to have a rational approach to the alliance
 2019 main satta parivartan ke liye puri tarah se wo sahyog or mehnat ke liye taiyaar hai
 To a question on the alliance with BSP in Maharashtra, Pawar said that it has not been talked to Mayawati, but i would be happy to have her support so that the alliance benefits in Vidarbha in the state

 Goyal said, though it could not be finalized

 The central government has currently taken a ceasefire along with the opposition on two important bills and it is believed that on Thursday it is now easier for the government to pass the bill related to foreign investment in insurance in the Rajya Sabha, but on the Land Acquisition Act Government's problems continue
 sarkaar ne vipaksh kii maang maanate hue khan or khanij (niyaman) bill ke saath-saath koyala khan (sanshodhan vidheyak) ko bhi select cameti ko bhej diya
 The opposition was constantly saying that the government is passing these bills in a hurry, ignoring the procedure laid down by the Parliament and these bills should be discussed
 sarkaar ne donon bilon par charchaa ke liye rajyasabha kii do select cametiyaan gathit kar di hai, jo 18 march se pehle apni report sansad ko dengi
 It is worth noting that the first part of the budget session of Parliament ends on March 20 and the government wants to pass both these bills before that
 mana ja rahaa he ki vipaksh ke tikhe virodh ko dekhte hue sarkaar ne bich kaa yah rasta nikaala he
 The opposition has been consistently opposing the enactment of legislation through ordinances and then later getting the consent of Parliament
 khanij or khan bill ko jahaan adhyadesh ke jariye 'thopane' se vipaksh naaraaz he, vahiin koyala bill par vipaksh kaa kahana he ki yah nijee companiyon ko khule bazaar main koyala bechney kaa rasta taiyaar karne vaala vidheyak he

 He appealed saying that the court p
 chidambaram ko yaa to najarband karen yaa phir antarim jamaanat de
 The lawyer appealed that he be served three days, or asked the lower court to extend the remand for three days
 is dauraan justise bhaanumati ne kaha ki aap nichali adaalat main house arest kii apil kyon nahin karte hai, isapar kapil sibbal ne kaha ki kyonki vahaan se apil khaarij ho jaaegi
 The Supreme Court has given p

 The trial court can also increase CBI custody
 haalanki, sibiai ne iskaa virodh kiya or kaha ki sibiai sirf somvaar tak castady ke liye raji hui thi
 Now the Supreme Court has said that if the interim petition is dismissed then the custody is extended for three days
 ab is maamle kii agali sunwaayee shuukravaar ko hogi

 Recently in his Mann Ki Baat program, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had appealed not to waste food
 ab unki sarkaar is apil ko hakeekat banane ja rahi he
 The central government may soon enact a rule that will decide how much food will be served in a thali in a hotel / restaurant
 kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ke anusaar mantralay is niyam par kaam kar rahaa he
 Two reasons for this step: The government is taking this step for two reasons
 pehla hotalon main khaane kii hone vaali barbaadi ko bachaane or doosraa log jeetna khaayen utane kaa hi paisa chukaa saken
 After the rule comes, it will be mandatory to write the quantity of food in the menu of all hotels
 haalanki niyam ko banane se pehle deshbhar main isko lekar survey hoga
 According to the Union Minister, this rule will not be applicable to small hotels and dhabas
 khaane kii bachat ke kaaran ectionramvilas paswan ne kaha ki saamaanya taur par sabhi kii khaane kii maatra lagbhag baraabar hoti he, koi chaaval adhik khaataa he to koi roti
 We are taking this type of action to save food and save money, if someone wants to eat more food, then can order again
 lekin pehle zyada mangakar khaanaa kharaab hone kaa koi phayda nahin he
 Paswan said that if someone demands to eat half plate in the hotel, then he should take the money according to it
 dhabas par koi asar nahinhotel industry ke sawaalon par unhone kaha ki ham yah niyam khud tay nahin karenge, sabhi se salaah ke baad isaki maatra tay karenge
 We assure that this will not affect the industry
 paswan bole ki is niyam ke antargat chote hotel yaa dhabas nahin aayenge
 Significantly, if the government is taking such a step to stop food wastage, then everyone will have to come together and take a decision on it

 mantri ke ghar ke baahar khadey guard ne poochtacha main bataaya ki mantri kaa kutta yahaan se nahin balki sarkari bangale se khoyaa he
 The ACP is engaged in finding the dog from the officer to the constable
 haalanki police ke adhikari bhi baton ko ghumaane main lag maamla chupaane kii koshish kar rahe hai, lekin ye jarur maanate he ki jab uttar pradesh main khoi hui bhens sarkaar kii liye badi he, to rajasthan main mantri ke kute ko bhi media bada bana degaa

 Last night, Facebook headman Mark Zuckerberg was present in front of American senators and there he answered very sharp questions
 is dauraan jakarberg ne fasebuk ke bijness model ke bare main bataaya joki vigyaapan aadhaarit he
 Simply put, Facebook collects information from users and with the help of those information advertisers advertise to the users
 aise main jab yugers kii jaankariyon ke sandarbh main sari duniya kii nigahen fasebuk par he tab watssap ko bhula diya gaya he
 Actually, Facebook collects users' data and shows advertisements but whatsapp's business model does not work like this
 watsap main abhi tak kisi prakaar ke vigyaapan nahin dikhaae jate hai
 Nor is any payment made by the users
 aise main watsap kii karypranali ko lekar sawaal bhi khadey ho sakate hai
 Because the parent company of whatsapp is Facebook itself
 kuch din pehle hi watsape ke suraksha ficharon ko lekar visheshgyon ne chintaa jataai he
 They believe that they are not as strong as they are claimed to be
 visheshgyon ne iske yugers samjhaute ke kuch praavdhaanon par prashnchinh khadey kiye hai, jahaan uske adhiktar galat kaam pakad main nahin aate yaa koi unhen chunauti nahin detaa he
 On this, a statement was issued by whatsapp and it was told that it collects only a small amount of information and every message is encrypted end-to-end
 lekin thik iske baad media reports main watsap kii pement policy ke sandarbh main jaankaree saamne ai ki company pements privesi policy ke tahat ikattha kii janevaali jaankariyaan third party sarvice prowiders se share karti he, jisamen fasebuk bhi shaamil he
 The company says that they share the information so that it can improve the payment operations
 privesi policy main ye bhi bataaya gaya he ki jo jaankariyaan third party services ke saath share kii jaati hai usamen aapkaa mobile phone number, registration information, divaais aaidentifire, vpas (virtual pement adress) or sender kaa UPI pin or pement amount shaamil he
 However, whatsapp had informed that the company does this to improve the payment process
 lekin kul milakar pement sambandhit data fasebuk tak pahunchaaya ja rahaa he, aise main fasebuk is data kaa kya upyog karata he is bare main kuch bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 It is also important to know here that whatsapp had launched a separate app for businessmen some time ago, that is, whatsapp can use the user's application somewhere in the near future
 philhal company ke saare adhikaar fasebuk ke paas hai or iske bijness model ke liye koi jaankaree saaf nahin he
 The question is if whatsapp is free and does not use customer data for advertising like Facebook, then what is its business model
 or agar watsap bhi fasebuk ke saath data supplai karata he to isaki safai kab saamne aegi
 When will people see this? kya mark jakarberg watsap ke sandarbh main bhi koi jawaab denge? The adamant TDP is on the verge of breaking away from the NDA to demand special status for Andhra Pradesh

 Bahrahal, Ankit has recently become the third Bollywood celebrity to be arrested in rape cases
 abhi kuch din pehle hi actor inder kumaar ko ek 22 saal kii ubhartee hui actress ke saath gaali-galoch or rape karne ke aarope main 25 april ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 He has been sent to judicial custody till 13 May
 isse pehle shaini ahuja ko apni naukaraani se rape karne ke aarope main 14 june 2009 ko giraftaar kar liya gaya tha
 Though the maid later withdrew her charges, the Mumbai court sentenced Shiney Ahuja to seven years in prison, holding him guilty of rape
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne ravivaar cobihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darjadia jane ko apana haq bataaya
 He also said that he did not oppose the demand of the previous state Devi government of giving special status to Bihar
 bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja die jane ko lekar bhagalpur or baankaa jilon main yojit adhikaar sammelan ke dauraan jansabhaon ko sambodhit karte hue nitish ne kaha ki unhone bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja die jane ke pradesh kii pichhali rabari devi sarkaar kii maang kaa virodh nahin kiya tha
 Nitish said that after the previous Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, the UPA government came to power at the Center, but why did he (lalu) not remain a minister at the Center and said that his wife Rabri Devi's government gave special state status to Bihar It was demanded that it be given now
 unhone kaha ki rajd supremeo ko bihar main rajg shasankaal main kanoon kaa raaj sthapit hona acha nahin lag rahaa he
 Does Lalu want the kidnapping industry to revive in Bihar? nitish ne kaha ki unke (lalu ke) parivartan yatra kaa matlab yah he ki bihar rajd shasankaal kii puraani sthiti main phir se waapas laut aae taaki yahaan kanoon kaa raaj khatm ho or aatank kaa raaj sthapit ho

 Got your chance, why didn't you do it in 15 years ’ nitish ne kaha ki bihar ke log badal chuke hai ab ve kisi ke bahekaave main nahin aane vaale hai

 UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had claimed that by June 15, he will get all the roads of UP inundated
 yogi kaa daawa upi kii 60 hajaar kilometre sadakon ko gaddha mukt karne kaa tha
 So did the roads of UP become free of pit? Aajtak's team did a reality check of Yogi's claim in about 21 districts of UP to find out the answer to this question
 yogi adityanath ne jab 15 june tak upi kii sadakon ko gaddha mukt karne kaa daawa kiya tha to ajtak ko camere lekar sadakon par nikalne kii chunauti bhi di thi
 There are only a few hours left to come on June 15, but the condition of all the roads in UP is still as bad
 kai jagah, sadaken gaddha mukt milin, lekin zyaadaatar sadakon kii haalat abhi bhi khasta he
 Now only a miracle can make all roads in UP pit free
 gondagonda main sadakon kii kahani khud sadaken hi bayaan kar rahi hai
 The road leading to the railway station is full of pits
 bas stesan ko jane vaali sadak par gaadiyaan chalati kam hai, uchhalati zyada hai
 The gonda-balrampur road was to become a fourlane, but there is still dust on it
 vyavsaayee arvind shrivastav kehete hai ki total vifaltaa prashasan kii he
 Balrampur adjoining Balrampurgonda has been the workplace for Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Nanaji Deshmukh, but the roads here are in bad shape
 gonda se balrampur kii duuri mahaj 45 kilometre he, lekin sadak aisi he ki dhai ghante main bhi pahunch jaaen to ganimat
 The administration has not even paid attention to the roads of Sant Kabir Nagar, adjacent to Gorakhpur, the work place of Sant Kabir Nagariyogi Adityanath
 neshnal hive se lekar bietisi maarg ko jodne vaali sadak par gadiyon kaa chalanaa mushkil he
 There may be confusion as to whether there are potholes or potholes in the roads of Maharajganj, the neighboring district of Maharajganj, Gorakhpur
 maharajaganj nepal kaa simavarti jila he
 There are also large pits in the Maharajganj Thoothibari road connecting Nepal, due to which accidents happen here
 baliyapurvanchal ke baliya jile main bhi sadakon main kamartod gadde hai
 There have been big pits in the road in front of SP office, the road in front of Kotwali is in bad condition
 yahaan ke logon ko yakeen nahin he ki 15 june tak sadaken gaddha mukt ho paaengi
 Some of Mau's roads close to Moubalia were filled with pits, but most of the roads connecting the city's main roads are still broken today
 yahaan sadak par chalanaa yani gaddhon main se hokar guzarana
 Yogi's claims are inverted here
 log kah rahe hai ki jo ab tak nahin hua to do din main kya ho jayega
 Ghazipur which is of Mau Mau, is also similar to Ghazipur
 neshnal hive bypass par bade-bade gadde hai
 There are fatal pits near the main Fulanpur railway crossing of Ghazipur city
 yahaan ke samajasevi brijabhooshan dube seene par takhti taange, logon ko gaddhon se bachane kii naseehat dete hai
 The condition of the aurai-mirzapur road connecting Mirzapur Mirzapur with Aurai is also similar
 ye sadak mirzapur ko bhadohi or jiti road se jodatii he
 But there are pits on this road in which once the car gets stuck, then it does not come out
 yogi sarkaar ke mantri 15 june tak gadde bharne kaa daawa to kar rahe hai, lekin kisi ko bhi in daavon par yakeen nahin he
 Rajendra Prasad, Minister for Rural Engineering said, "90 roads in the entire Mirzapur division were supposed to be free of dirt
 5 par kaary pragati par he, 15 june tak use karnaa hi hoga
 By the evening of 15 June, i received a report that if not completed, who would be guilty would be suspended
 "sthaneey nivasee dharmendra ne kaha, "aurai se yahaan tak bole the ki gadda mukt ho jayega magar abhi tak nahin hua
 The road has been bad for ten to fifteen years
 ummid thi ki sadak ban jaaegi magar ab nahin lagata he
 "most of the districts of Sonbhadra, Mughalsarai, Allahabad, Jaunpur UP have the same condition of roads
 sonbhadra main sadaken tuuti hui hai to kai sadaken teen saal se banani shuru nahin huin
 The condition of Mughalsarai and Allahabad roads is bad
 kuch yahi haal jonpur kii sadakon kaa bhi he
 The condition of Rae Bareli Road from Lalganj, Rae Bareliunnav is very bad
 lalganj ke paas ye sadak buree tarah tuuti he
 The road is less, the pits are more
 ye upi kii vyast sadakon main se ek he, lekin is sadak par gaddhon se bachakar gaadiyaan nikaalnaa koi hansi khel nahin he
 The condition of this entire road of about 85 kilometers is similar
 15 june tak is sadak kaa bhala hone ke asaar dur dur tak dikhaai nahin dete
 Mathuraye is the road to Mathura, the city of Lord Krishna
 maant ilaake kii ye sadak mathura ko gramin ilaake se jodatii he
 But there are two-two feet deep pits on this road
 hathrasahatharas main NH-93 se shahar ke andar ja rahi 11 kimi lambii sadak ukhdi padi he
 Dust flying from large vehicles and big pits from above feast on accidents
 yahi haalat sikandrarau se kasganj ko jane vaali sadak, sikandrarau se jalesar jane vaali sadak kaa he
 pilibhitpilibhit has roads all over the city
 puuranpur tehsil kaa mukhya maarg ukhda padaa he
 700 kilometers of roads in Pilibhit are to be pitched
 lekin abhi 50 fisadi kaam nahin hua he
 Empty stones have been put on the pits in all the roads
 lakhimpur khirilkhimpur main sadakon kii khastahali kii kahani jaanane ke liye bas colectrate get or peedblyoody ke sarkari guest house ke saamne kii sadakon par nigaah daal lijie
 When there are so many deep pits on the roads of such important places, then what can happen to the rest of the district, you can guess
 sadakon main gadde dekhakar kahin se nahin lagata ki 15 june tak ye sadaken gaddhamukt ho paaengi
 The pits on the main roads of Farrukhabad, Farrukhabad may have been filled, but the condition of the roads within the city and in the rural areas is bad
 pakkaa pul kii sadak, devrampur kii sadak par gadde hi gadde hai, jinamein vaahan hichkole lete hue nikalate hai
 The road connecting Etayetta to Kasganj, Badaun, Bareilly is very poor
 gadde zyada hai, sadak bahut kam bachi he
 The city's main thoroughfare is waterlogged
 eta-jalesar, jalesar-nidhauli road kii bhi khasta haal he
 Baghpataye is the condition of delhi-yamunotri highway in Baghpat district
 hive par eent bichhi hai
 In which pits are built in place
 in gaddhon main aksar gaadiyaan funs jaati hai
 After this, the situation becomes jam for hours
 15 june aane ko he, lekin is sadak par gadde bharne kaa intjaar aaj bhi he
 Hapurukuch is similar in Hapur district
 jile kii zyaadaatar sadaken tuuti padi hai
 The condition of roads in Garh tehsil is worse
 yahaan sadak or gaddhon kaa bhed mit jaataa he
 Yogi Adityanath had fixed the deadline of June 15 to fill the pit, but the work had not even started till June 12

 On this occasion, a team of doctors posted at the venue reached the stage to see
 chikitsakon ne gadakari kaa sugar level or bladpressure kii jaanch kii or unhen khaane ke liye ek kelaa diya
 The sound of the speakers was reduced considerably and for their convenience, they had a pedestal fan installed

 Bollywood King Shahrukh Khan's film Zero 21 is going to release on December
 ye film phens ke saath shahrukh ke liye bhi bahut myne rakhti he
 For Romance King, who has been in the film industry for more than 25 years, zero success is important for maintaining his reign
 vaise industry main kaayam bane rahane kii jaddojahad ko khud shahrukh ne jiro ke pramotion ke dauraan jaahir kiya tha
 He had said, "if zero is not working then i will not get work in the industry for 6 months
 "nahin chal paa rahaa shahrukh kaa jaadooshahrukh khan kii pichhali filmon par najar daalen to imtiyaaj ali ke nirdesan main bani 'harry met sejal' ko darshakon ne buree tarah se nakaar diya tha
 Before this, 'dear Zindagi', directed by Gauri Shinde, could not be seen at the box office
 haalanki film kii saraahna hui thi
 The magic of both films faded
 shahrukh kii jholii main 'rais' ke baad koi badi hit film nahin ai
 The challenge of maintaining the status of romance king Shahrukh is called the romance king of Bollywood
 lekin pichley kuch saalon se unhen ye rutaba banaae rakhane main mushkil ho rahi he
 King Khan's thriller drama 'harry Met Sejal' flopped even after Shah Rukh
 ab unka ye rutaba jiro se barkaraar rahane kii ummid he
 During the announcement of Zero, Anand L
 Roy himself said in an interview, "how we want to see Shahrukh on screen, we will show it in Zero
 "box offis par gira cresbollywood main box offis par teenon khan kii tulana karen to lambey vakt se aamir khan or salmaan khan chhaae hue hai
 By the way, salman-aamir's previous films were Race 3 and Thugs of Hindostan flop
 haalanki donon kii saakh tikat khidki par abhi bhi bani hui he
 Despite all the criticisms, the films of both the stars had managed to earn over 100 crores
 shahrukh ke khate main lambey vakt se 100 karod kii koi film nahin ai he
 It is a matter of seeing what the fans respond to the zero at the ticket window
 pehali baar boune bane shahrukhajiro kii kahani ek boune shaks kii he
 Shahrukh Khan has also taken a kind of risk with his character
 boune shaks kaa lead role main kirdaar hindi cinema main kam hi najar aata he
 By the way, these days fans are liking real and experimental stories
 aise main jiro kii kahani logon ko cinema ke parde tak laane main kaamyaab ho sakati he
 This film as a hero can prove to be a long one for Shahrukh's career in Bollywood
 lekin yah box offis par darshakon ke respons se sabit hoga

 The family living in it was full of money
 par kuch aisi vipadaa ai ki puraa parivaar paise-paise ko mohataaj ho gaya
 Now what to do if you do? The house was so big that many rooms of that house were never even opened
 khayr, kisi nun-roti kaa jugad kar yah log jivan bitaane lage
 One day a monk came
 usne gharavaalon se khaane ke liye kuch laane ko kaha
 Now what to do if there is nothing in the house
 sadhu samaj gaya
 He said, let it be
 khaanaa chodo
 Give me a room to spend the night that you have not used for years
 gharavaalon ne kaha, sadhu maharaj, kai kamare hai jo varshon se band pade hai
 He said, you can open any one of them and clean them up
 ghar kaa mukhiya khud cameraa kholane ke liye gaya
 On opening the room, only garbage was seen in it
 aap mukhiya ne pehle jameen, phir almariyaan saaf kin
 He was surprised when he opened the last cupboard
 isamen sone ke sikkon se bharaa ek gadaa band tha
 The chief brought the pot to the monk and said, "maharaj, we understood that you have come to do good to us
" phir us parivaar ne apane ghar ke har kamare ko kholaa, dhoyaa, poncha or har kamare se kuch na kuch dhan unhen mila

 lekin is gusse kii vajah se uskaa apana swabhaav itnaa bheetar dab gaya ki use chaahakar bhi ab vah khoj nahin paa rahi
