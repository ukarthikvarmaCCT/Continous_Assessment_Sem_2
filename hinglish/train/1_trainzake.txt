 In the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir, very little agriculture is done due to the cold weather and high altitude
 lekin pichley kuch saal se is kshetra main ugane vaali jhaadi ne kisaanon kii takadir badal di he
 This thorny bush is known as seabuckthorn on which small berry (berry fruit) also grows
 kaha jaataa he jab changez khan duniya par kabze ke liye chalaa tha tabhi uski sena ko mongolia ke pahaad main khaane ke liye kuch bhi nahin mil rahaa tha tab unhone sibuckthorn khaaye jo khaane main kaaphi kadave hote hai lekin us ke khaane se vah kai dinon tak mongolia ke pahaado main ladate rahe
 Seabuckthorn grows in its natural way in the Ladakh region of India
 kai saal pehle ladakh kshetra main kisaan is jhaadi main bahut tej kaante hone ke chalate isko kheton ke chaaron or barbandi ke liye lagaate the taaki kheton ko jaanwaron se bachaaya ja sake
 But for the last 10 years now the fruit of seabuckthorn is changing the fate of the farmers in Ladakh
 ladakh main sthit dihaar (dephence institute of hai altitude research) ne pichley 15 saal se is fal par research karke is fal ko kaaphi taqatvar or laabhadaayak paaya
 After doing research on this bush, its fruit was found to be oxidant, which was the best diet to make people healthy and disease free in high altitude areas
 DRDO ne pehle sibuckthorn se chyavanprash or zeus taiyaar kiye
 Tea was made from its leaves which became very popular as well as proved to be very helpful to the soldiers in high altitude places like Siachen
 pichley saal hi yogaguru ram dev kii sanstha patanjali ne DRDO ke saath qaraar karke sibuckthorn ke utpaada taiyaar karne ke liye qaraar kiya or kisaanon main yah fal kharidne kii hode lag gai
 As a result, farmers started buying Seabuckthorn, now also known as Ladakh Berry, for 20 to 30 rupees per kg
 ab ladakh main sibuckthorn ko ugane ke liye kisaan bhi utaavle ho gayi hai
 It is believed that the Seabuckthorn Ladakh region may change the fate of the farmers in the coming year
 DRDO kii taraf se pichley 2 din se ladakh main sibuckthorn par ek neshnal seminar kaa aayojan ho rahaa he jisamen kisaanon ko is fal kii kheti ko protsaahit kiya ja rahaa he
 This unique thing that grows in the Ladakh region can be made part of the plate of the people

 Also, its direct benefit will be to the farmers of Ladakh region
 vah yah bhi maanate hai ki pichley 5 saal main ladakh main sibuckthorn ugane vaale kisaanon kii taadaad bhi doguni ho gai he

 kendriya grih rajyamantri hansraj ahir ne sansad main ek likhit jawaab main kaha he ki pakistan main maujuud aatanki sanghathan aatankwaadiyon ko 26 / 11 kii tarah samudr ke raste bharat main ghuspaith or hamale kii training de rahe hai
 In July 2018, 'aaj Tak' first exposed the "sea jihad" plan of the terrorists
 'ajtak' ne pichley saal july main bataaya tha ki pakistan jab- jab bhartiya suraksha balon ke oparation main munh kii khaataa he to vah badla lene ke raste dhundne lagata he
 This time Pakistan's army, Pakistan intelligence agency ISI and Jaish bosses have prepared a big plan to attack India again like 26 / 11
 ye plan he "samudri jehad" kaa
 The Pakistan Navy's Frogman, the commandos of the Pak Water Wing and the Commandos of the Special Service Group (SSG), are preparing 50 dreaded terrorists of jaish-e-mohammed to infiltrate into India through water and carry out major incidents
 khufia agenciyon nepakistanki is tareeke kii badi chaal ko haal hi main dicode kiya he
 Intelligence sources have told 'aaj Tak' that Pakistan is doing all this in a fury
 sutron ne jaankaree di he ki paak kii is napak chaal ke peeche bhartiyanevior tateey ilaakon par bane sansthaanon ko nishaanaa banane kaa bada plan he
 What was the plan of Pak terrorists - jaish-e-mohammad's "sea jihad" was exposed
 -bharat par "si root" se hamalaa karne ke jaish kaa plan dicode
 - Jem failed to carry out major attacks on land "the new brigade is preparing to attack big cities and navy on the coast
 -pakistan ke bahawalpur main aatankiyon kii ek badi fouj ko paak navy ke "frog main" or special sarvice group ke commando de rahe hai training
 According to sources, Jaish is training swimming and diving to about 50 "sea jihadi" terrorists
 -khufia sutron ke mutabik jaish e mohammad ke aatankiyon kii ye training iesai kii nigaraanee main di ja rahi he
 According to sources, this time, Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI is training sea route trainers of Jaish terrorists for a 26 / 11 attack on India
 bahawalpur main samudri jehad kii trainingpakistanke bahawalpur main jaish e mohammad kaa head quarter he jahaan par pakistan kii khufia agency iesai kii nigaraanee main samudri jihadi aatankwaadiyon ko training di gai thi
 Intelligence sources have informed that Maulana Masood Azhar and his brother Abdul Rauf had earlier selected around 500 terrorist recruits to recruit 50 top sea jihadis
 uske baad 50 zyada kattar aatankiyon kaa brinwash kar unako tairaaki or gotakhori kii training di gai
 Sources have said that these terrorists can damage military and navy installations under water for several kilometers
 khufia agencyke sutron ne 'ajtak' ko jaankaree di he ki elosi or international border par bhartiya suraksha agenciyon ne aatankiyon kii naak main dam kar rakhaa he
 At the moment, at the launch pad of the loc, nearly 300 terrorists of Jaish and other terrorist groups are not able to infiltrate into India due to the security forces
 koi ghuspaith karne kii himakat bhi karata he to usko suraksha bal seemaa par hi dher kar de rahe hai
 This is the reason that Jaish has taken the path of dangerous sea jihad instead of "ground jihad"
 yani pakistan kii saraparasti main jaish ke aatanki ab pani ke raste bharat ke tateey ilaakon ko nishaanaa banane kii purajor koshish main lage hai
 Now more than Lashkar sources have informed 'aaj Tak' on Jaish that ISI and its army is trusting jaish-e-mohammed terrorists more than lashkar-e-taiba
 isaki vajah ye he ki lashkar antarrashtriya sanghathanon or america kii najar main he
 There is no specific ban on Jem yet
 yahi vajah he ki vah pakistan ke bahawalpur main paak navy ke "frog main" jaish ke aatankiyon kii ek toli bharat par hamalaa karne ke liye taiyaar kar rahe hai
 Let me tell you that in 2008, when 26 / 11 attacks were carried out by Lashkar terrorists in Mumbai, Pakistan had trained 10 Lashkar terrorists through its Frog Man Commandos
 is baat kaa khulaasa david colman hedli ne bhi apane kaboolname main kiya tha
 Once again, Pakistan is preparing to send its most trusted terrorist organization against India by sending funds and modern equipment and goods to India via sea
 haalanki bhartiya suraksha balon ne inke plan ko dicode kar diya he, jiske baad sabhi tateey ilaakon main alert rahane ke nirdesh die gaye hai
 At present, the Supreme Court has refused to stay the petitions being filed continuously in the courts across the country
 centre sarkaar kii ore se daakhil transfar yachika par supreme court ne sabhi yachikakartaon ko notice bheja he, is maamle kii agali sunwaayee 2 disambar ko hogi
 The Central Government had sought to transfer the petition coming in different High Courts to the same High Court, the Court told the Center that the issues raised in different petitions are different, so the petitions cannot be stayed
 kisaanon ko notebandi se ho rahi pareshaani par court ne sarkaar se poocha he ki pareshaani dur karne ke liye kya kiya ja rahaa he, jawaab main sarkaar kaa kahana he ki kisaanon ke liye kadam uthaae gaye he jisase beej kharidne main koi pareshaani naa aae
 6 lakh crores accumulated, on behalf of the central government, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said in the court that now the situation is better and better than ever, the queues in banks are continuously decreasing
 bainkon main abhi tak 6 lakh karod rupee jamaa ho chuke hai or sarkaar ko ummid he ki 10-15 lakh karod rupee tak jamaa honge
 Rohatgi said that this move will improve the economic condition of banks, the use of digital payment and digital money has increased in the country in the past, while online payments have increased
 sarkaar kii ore se kaha gaya ki logon ne 70 saal se paise jamaa karke rakhe he isliye jaahir he ki sabhi paisa jamaa hone main thodaa samay lagegaa
 In July this year, there was a lot of uproar at the Maruti Suzuki factory in Manesar, Haryana
 yah factory 600 acre main he or iske liye jameen kaa adhigrahan do charnon main varsh 2004 or 2005 main hua
 But the owners of the land demanded more than the compensation given earlier on the basis of clause 18 of the existing Land Acquisition Act

 24 crores Rs
 kii maang kii to car company ne kah diya ki vah is raashi ko dene kii jagah plant ko hi band kar dena behatar samajhegi
 Maruti Suzuki Limited Chairman R
 si
 Says Bhargava, "our case is a live example of complex questions related to land acquisition and compensation to the displaced
" aise masalon par niti spasht karne kii jarurat thi
 But the new bill also did not specify how the price of the land would be decided
 haalanki isamen pichley vidheyak ke muaavje or punarvaas jaise kuch masalon ko sulajhane kii koshish jarur kii gai he
 “government policies in India are increasing the intricacies of land acquisition and are causing controversies
 nateeja yah ki tamaam pariyojnaayen lataki padi hai
 Figures from public sector banks show that as of March, Rs 7 lakh crore
 se bhi adhik kii pariyojnaayen paryaavaran sambandhi manjuuri nahin milane ke kaaran lambit hai
 a bigger issue than this is the rights of the displaced
 uchit muaavja kya ho or punarvaas kaise ho? purana kanoon angrejon ne 1894 main banaaya tha or usamen khami-hi-khami he
 But the question is, in case of fair compensation and transparency, will the problem be resolved with the Land Acquisition, Restoration and Rehabilitation Bill, 2013? Infrastructure projects will have the biggest impact in the coming years because of the considerable time taken for all types of clearances
 The cost of the project will also increase if compensation is given as per the provisions of the new bill
 nae vidheyak ke mutabik jameen ke adhigrahan ke liye saamaajik prabhaav akalan (esaiye) survey jaruri hoga, jo gaanvon ke maamle main gram sabha se or shaharon ke maamle main aise hi kisi nikaay se vichaar-vimarsh kar taiyaar kiya jayega
 Thereafter, an expert committee will be responsible for reviewing this report, which will consist of two non-government social scientists, two rehabilitation experts and one project related technical expert
 iske saath hi report kii samiksha ek anya samiti yah dekhne ke liye karegi ki bhoomi adhigrahan kaa prastaav sabhi aavashyak sharton par khara utarataa he yaa nahin
 Ajit Gulabchand, chairman of HCC Ltd, a company linked to the basic sector, says, "the effect of the new bill will be that the companies buying land will have to face litigation
" nijee companiyon ke liye laagat se kahin badi baadha he tarah-tarah kii manjuuri
 Moreover, since this law is to come into force from the previous date, the projects on which work is going on will also get mired in controversies
 ”godarej samooh ke chairman aadi godarej kehete hai, ''hamen yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki jo kisaan jameen de rahe hai, unke or udyog ke hiton ke bich santulan ho
 "adi Godrej earlier said in an interview," Some issues have been resolved, but i am worried about some provisions of the Land Acquisition Bill
 ” unhone kaha ki sarkari hastkshep se pehle 80 fisadi gaanv waalon kii sahmati kii baadhyataa kuch zyada hi he
 The industry suggested keeping it at 60 per cent
 real estate kaarobaar se jude diggaj kehete hai ki chunki muaavja adhik dena hoga, isliye property kii keemat kareeb 30 fisadi bad jaaegi
 According to the law, the compensation of the acquired land will be four times the market price for rural areas and two times for urban areas
 yadi adhigrahit kii gai jameen ko muaavje se adhik keemat par kisi tisare paksh ko bechaa jaataa he to 40 fisadi munafa jameen ke mul maalik ke hisse main jayega
 Niranjan Hiranandani, co-founder and managing director of Hiranandani Group, says, "the price is skyrocketing in urban areas
" muaavje main baari rakam deni padegi
 "in the case of big projects, only the price of land will not be affected, because the cost of land in this level of projects is only 2-4 percent of the total cost
 hiranandani kehete hai, ''lekin kuch kshetra, jaise saste makaan, jeb se baahar ho jaaenge kyonki vahaan jameen kii keemat hi kul laagat kaa 33-43 fisadi hoti he
 Lalit Kumar Jain, national president of CREDAI, the apex body of developers, says that this bill is only "making good, not promoting development
" ” ve kehete hai ki adhik muaavja or baari sankhya main logon kii sahmati ke praavdhaan ke kaaran netaaon or bhu-mafiaon kaa bolbalaa rahegaa
 Chintan Patel, director of Transaction Advisory Services at Ernst & Young, believes that compensation should be at market value
 ve kehete hai, ''jab aap company ko punarvaas muhaiyaa karaane ko kah rahe hai to aisa kyon chaahate hai ki companiyaan bazaar mulya se chaar guna zyada muaavja den?”hiranandani kehete hai ki shahari jameen kaa uchit muaavja dedh guna hota
 He said that apart from this, the government would also have to acquire land for big projects and preserve it, as Narendra Modi did in Gujarat
 hiranandani kehete hai, ''maharashtra jaise tamaam rajyon main vaastavik rate se kahin adhik par hisaab-kitaab kiya jaataa he
 “construction companies need large tracts of land to set up factories and are already facing the brunt of disputes in lawsuits and compensation and delays in approvals at various levels

 Apart from this, it is also important to withdraw arcelormittal from the Odisha project and Pasco's withdrawal from the Karnataka Steel Project citing the delay in land acquisition
 nae vidheyak se ye sab or mushkil hone ja rahaa he
 Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director of JSW Steel, says, "now for any firm, the acquisition of land has become a nightmare
 vidheyak ke masaude main nijee companiyon ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya tha, lekin antim praaroop main inhen bhi daal diya gaya he

 bangaloru ke indian institute for human setlements ke amalanjyoti goswami jaise visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki sarkaar kii najar is vakt chunaavon par he

 phir bhi raajnneetik lihaaj se shahari ilaake utane ahm nahin hai, jitne gramin ilaake hai
 However, the government does not favor this debate
 kendriya gramin vikaas mantri jairam ramesh india today se kehete hai, ''hamaari unnati jameen adhigrahan karne kii hamaari kshamta par kabhi nirbhar nahin rahi
 Land acquisition is a small way
 ” jairam aage kehete hai ki chaar guna muaavje se maowad par ankush lagane main madad milegi
 But this argument is not embracing the industry
 bhargav kaa kahana he, ''duniya main kahin bhi nijee companiyon ke liye sarkaar jameen nahin kharidti
 "in a country like India where there are many complexities of ownership, the new law will only bring trouble

 iske baad hi polio ko niyantrit karne kaa abhiyaan shuru kiya gaya
 Karl's most important discovery is to discover the system associated with the separation of the blood group, and the 1937 rhesus factor in association with Alexander Weiner, which makes it possible to bleed

 The constitutional bench of 7 judges of the Supreme Court has given this decision from 4-3

 The Supreme Court made it clear that if a candidate does this then it will be considered as corrupt conduct under the Representation of People Act (RP Act)

 to apane aapako janata kaa mukhyamantri bataane vaale arvind kejariwal dilli ke mukhyamantri ban hi gaye
 Winning 67 seats out of 70 seats means that at present people have accepted him as their chief minister, but Kejriwal's challenge also starts from here
 ab un par janata kii ummiido kaa bhayankar dawaab hoga or har din yah sawaal bhi munh baae khadaa rahegaa ki vah janata kii in ummiido ko kaise puraa karenge? kaise un sapanom ko hakeekat main badalenge jo unhone janata ko dikhaaye hai? vah bhi tab jab unhone dilli kii janata se ek nahin 70 vaayade kiye hai
 On 10 February, when the election results were coming in favor of AAP (aam Aadmi Party), this slogan was echoing in the office of Aam Aadmi Party- 'pardon water bills, electricity bills half and Congress, BJP clean' 
 isi dauraan kejariwal ne kaha tha, is tarah kii jeet dekhakar mujhe andar se bahut dar bhi lag rahaa he
 Kejriwal did not say openly, but he too probably realizes that the road to power is not easy
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki kaise is vaadakhilaphi kaa thikra kendra ke maththe phoda jaae isaki bhoomika shapath lene se pehle hi likhi jane lagi thi
 Team Kejriwal is well aware that most of the promises made to the 1
25 billion people of Delhi cannot be fulfilled even in five years
 tabhi to pradhanmantri se lekar grahamantri tak se hui mulaakaat main dilli ko rajya kaa darja die jane kii maang ched di gai he, jabaki ye baat unhen bhi pataa he ki is maang ko puraa karnaa kendra ke liye to khaasaa mushkil he hi, kuch had tak dilli ke hit main bhi nahin he
 If given the status of the state, then Delhi will not get a major part of the budget received by the Center
 baat sirf bajtbhar kii nahin he or bhi kai vibhaagon ko lekar dikkat aani shuru ho jaaegi
 For example, if part of the Red Fort comes to the center, then parts of commercial centers like Daryaganj and Chandni Chowk will come, then who will compensate for the loss of revenue to Delhi? As such, nowhere in the world has the state capital been given statehood
 apane 49 dinon kii sarkaar ‘aap’ ne jan lokapal bill ke naam qurbaan kar di
 Then the common people openly expressed their displeasure and said that we had chosen Kejriwal on important issues like free electricity, water and security, the rest of the issues do not matter
 lihaaja is baar har jagah chunavi sabhaaon ke dauraan kejariwal ne kaha ki kuch bhi ho jaae paanch saal kursi nahin chodenge
 Now if five years remain in his post, then he will have to fulfill the promises made to the public
 sivaay ‘aap’ ke netaaon ko chhodkar zyaadaatar logon se puuchhen to har koi yahi kahegaa ye lagbhag asambhav he
 If a few promises are left, then they cannot fulfill most of the promises until the green flag of the central government is found
 ab ye kendra sarkaar par nirbhar karata he ki ve dilli kii chuni hui sarkaar ke vaayade puure karne or kejariwal ko dilli ke saath-saath aas-paas ke rajyon main apana janaadhar badhaane main kis had tak sahyog karen! Keep in mind, when the Aam Aadmi Party went to the public during the elections, it did not say anywhere that they could not fulfill their promises till the Central Government cooperates, although when they were releasing their manifesto So the question was definitely asked by the reporters that how will you fulfill these promises, then 'team Kejriwal' said that we will seek cooperation from the Center and if the public will worry about the problems So he will definitely help
 vaise kendra ke saamne dilli jaise kai rajya hai or use bina kisi bhedbhaav ke sabaki madad kerani he
 Haryana has already made it clear that Delhi should not depend on the water of our state, that is, we should also find another option
 yahi baat bijli ke liye himachal or uttarakhand jaise rajya bhi kah sakate hai
 If in 49 days the AAP government gave a subsidy of Rs 200 crore to the power companies for the concession in electricity rates to the people of Delhi
 agar is baar dilli kii nai sarkaar apane chunavi ghoshnaptr ke mutabik, logon ko bijli or pani par sabsidi detii he to ek saal main is par kareeb 1900 karod rupee kharch honge
 Apart from electricity and water, many promises like free wifi, 500 schools, 20 colleges, 15 thousand cameras, one guard in every bus, recruitment of four thousand doctors, 15 thousand paramedics, two lakh public toilets, new power station, 8 lakh new jobs
 Also have to complete it
 is par kitna kharch hoga philhal anumaan laga paanaa bhi mushkil he
 From the top, the AAP has also said that it will reduce VAT rate in Delhi at the lowest in the country, while it is the biggest source of Delhi's income
 to aakhir paisa aayega kahaan se? vaise bhi dilli kaa kul bajet kareeb 37 hajaar karod kaa hi he, jo saamaanya kharch chalaane ke liye hi paryaapt he
 By the way, if Kejriwal fulfills half of the promises made by Kejriwal, then perhaps the people of Delhi can give him a chance once more, and perhaps in some other states of the country, his account may be opened and other parties have a chance to improve
 lekin yadi ghoshnaptr ke vaayade ‘kagaji’ sabit hue to team kejariwal ko yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki jo janata modi ko sir-ankhon par bithaane ke baad mahaj nau maah main hi dhul chataa sakati he vah shaayad kejariwal ko itnaa vakt bhi na de

 The Admissions Committee has to finalize the DU administration's intentions

 'meaning is clear - now 80 percent of those who bring will also have at least one more chance that they can get the desired college and desired subject in DU

 There are a total of 55000 seats in the undergraduate course in DU, including all colleges

 There will also be an increase after entrance

 Admission process is simple

 Private company has entered our college too
 to matlab saaf he uniwarsity nijee haathon main dena chaah rahe hai
 'there is no doubt that this decision may reduce the number of races
 lekin khatara ye he ki isse kahin admician ke liye bhi koching kaa nayaa dhandha na shuru ho jaae
 Sudhanshu Kumar, vice-president of Delhi University Teachers Association (DUTA), says, "this decision will give a boost to the coaching center like a mushroom
" jo aam aadmi he uske upar naahak hi boj daalaa ja rahaa he
 Suppose the child everywhere has the 12th result, why is it associated with the entrance
 12veen main jo exam kii prakriya he, 8 paper 10 paper jo bachche jo mehnat karke dete hai us rigelt kii sanctity kaa kya he?'haalanki diu ko abhi puri tasviir saaf kerani he
 But it is also clear that some weightage will also be available for the 12th examination and you will have to do well in the entrance exam

 People want to see something different: Today there is a lot of pressure on actors because they have to do a lot of multi-tasking
 dance bhi aana chahie, sicks pack abs bhi hone chahie to ye kahaan tak jastiphi he
 In response to this question, Anushka said that this happens because nowadays, the audience wants to see something different and different
 kyonki gane to har koi aajkal jhaar par apni echdi tivi par bhi dekh letaa he or sun letaa he
 So when he comes to the hall to watch the film, he wants to see something different

 Marriage is on my agenda, but when will it not happen? Running a Patarishte depends on two people how they run their relationship

 a lot of work was done in Bombay Valvet's very progressive film Thefilm and no one can be blamed for why this film flopped
 jab ek film banati he to us par puri team kaam karti he to kisi ek person ko dosha dena acchhee baat nahin he
 There are many times that you are unable to explain your point to people and this is what happened with this film
 border par khadey sainik ko fark nahin padataa ki koi film relies ho rahi he yaa nahinkisi sahi mudde ko kahin or le jaakar mode dena acchhee baat nahin he
 i do not speak for myself in all these disputes because i am the daughter of an army person and my father was in the department of the army that fights
 isliye jab kabhi waar hota he or papa kii posting vahaan hoti thi to mummy bas tivi ke saamne har baithi rahati thim ki kahin koi buree khabar na aa jaae
 i know that Soldier fighting on the border does not matter which film is being released here or not
 isliye aise muddon ko kisi sensobil baat se jodna mujhe bahut sasta lagata he

 is sambandh main apni aapatti darj karaate hue congress ke netaa mallikarjun khadge ne sawaal uthaate hue piem narendra modi ko khat likhaa he
 He has stated that the selection standards were not followed in this case
 congress ke is varisht netaa ne aarope lagaaya ki sibiai chif chune jane sambandhi chayan cameti main pradhanmantri, desh ke mukhya nyaayadhish or loksabhaa main vipaksh kii sabase badi party ke netaa hote hai
 In this context, a meeting of the selection committee was not called deliberately to make a junior officer acting CBI chief
 varisht adhikari anil sinha ke ritair hone ke baad asthana ko acting chif banaaya gaya he
 The government has said on this issue that in response to this letter, it will give its stand and explain why this committee did not meet
 kaha ja rahaa he ki 1984 batch ke ipies adhikari rakesh asthana sarkaar kii is post ke liye pehali pasand the lekin vah varishthata kram main junior the or is kaaran sambhavit ummidavaaron ke liye banaae jane vaale panel main bhi shaamil nahin hote
 The comments duusari ore aalochakon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki asthana ko antarim chif niyukt karne ke liye sarkaar ko sellection cameti kii meeting bulaane kii jarurat bhi nahin thi lekin is kadam se asthana ke agle saal sibiai chif banane kaa rasta khul gaya he
 This is because by then he will also reach the seniority rank and will be able to join the panel of potential candidates
 pradhanmantri ko likhe khat main khadge ne anil sinha ke ritair hone se teen din unke baad duusare sabase varisht adhikari aarake datta ke achaanak transfar kaa masalaa bhi uthaaya he

 is lihaaj se ek junior adhikari ko kaaryakari sibiai chif banane ke liye jaanboojhkar sellection cameti kii meeting ko nahin bulaayaa gaya
 After the retirement of senior officer Anil Sinha, Asthana has been made Acting Chief
 sarkaar ne is masale par kaha he ki is khat ke jawaab main vah apana paksh rakhte hue bataaegi ki aakhir is kyon is cameti kii meeting nahin hui
 It is being said that Rakesh Asthana, a 1984 batch IPS officer, was the first choice for this post of the government but he was a junior in the seniority order and due to this, does not even join the panel for potential candidates
 tippaniyan On the other hand, critics also say that the government did not even need to call a selection committee meeting to appoint Asthana as interim chief, but the move opened the way for Asthana to become CBI chief next year
 aisa isliye kyonki vah tab tak varishthata kram main bhi upar pahunch jaaenge or iske chalate sambhavit ummidavaaron ke panel main shaamil ho sakenge
 In a letter to the Prime Minister, Kharge has also raised the issue of sudden transfer of RK Dutta, the second-most senior officer after Anil Sinha, three days after his retirement

 ) Small capital and big charisma are the brightest faces of Indian entrepreneurship
 kaarobaar ke halaat hameshaa ek jaise nahin rahete lekin udhyamita vipareet paristhatiyon ko bhi avasar banane kii kala he, jisamen bharat udhyamiyon kaa koi sani nahin
 Innovation and start ups are long-standing words in our business language, but India has been the hub of indigenous start ups since decades ago
 aise start ap jo aam taur par nijee puunji se bane or aise innowator jo hamen hameshaa nae prayogon se chamatkrit karte rahe
 For the India Today annual issue, we found out entrepreneurs who have broken leaks in every way and created new dimensions of success with their new ideas
 safalataa kii ye kahaniyaan, bhartiya udhyamita ko lekar kai myth todatii hai, masalan yah ki china main bane saste utpaadon ke saamne bhartiya nirmaataa tik nahin pate
 But in this particular issue, not one but many businessmen will be found who have not allowed cheap imports to enter the market or have made their level of innovation so high and wide that it is difficult for foreign imports to touch it
 isliye kai utpaadon main aaj bhi bhartiya nirmaataa quality or keemat main bazaar ke sirmaur hai
 a second belief is that Indian entrepreneurs, who are doing well, are reluctant to make rapid changes in their products
 is visheshank main kai kahaniyaan aisi hai jinamein udhyamiyon ne puraani takanic ke utpaadon kii jameen par aadhuniktaa kii imaarat banaai he
 Many entrepreneurs have gone ahead by expanding and diversifying their traditional businesses, which is completely different from their old identities
 udhyamita ke jazbe ko phalne-phoolne ke liye bahut badi jameen nahin chahie
 In this issue you will find such people whose business sense forces us to press the finger under the teeth and it tells that if the fingers are on the pulse of the market then from litter-waste to selling tea and getting married, success in any work Can be achieved in kaarobaari nai sujh ke keval ucch takanic vaale kshetron main kendrit hone kii dharna bhi tut rahi he
 The sky of innovation is infinite
 isame kheti ke kaam aane vaale utpaadon se lekar food products, crockeri, pharmaceuticals, kaagaj, chamada jaise puraane udyog bhi shaamil hai or data security, digital publicing jaisi nae udyog bhi
 New-minded entrepreneurship is not limited to old industrial centers only
 vibhinn prakaar kii chunautiyon ke baavjood desh ke chote shahar nai sujh ke udyogon kaa centre lagaataar bane hue hai
 These stars of business sense and success reinforce our faith in Indian entrepreneurship, which has stood fiercely amidst every storm and taken advantage of every small opportunity

 After every incident, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav only assures harsh action, but in reality nothing seems to happen
 beete saal march main sabase yuva mukhyamantri ke taur par shapath lene vaale akhilesh yadav se uttar pradesh kii janata ko dheron ummiden thim ki vah sapa kii paramparaagat gunda chhavi ko badalakar logon ke bharose par khara utrenge, lekin shapath grahan ke din se shurusube main sapaiyon kii gundgardee kaa silsilaa badastoor jarihe
 The latest case is of Kunda in Pratapgarh district, where Deputy Superintendent of Police Zillaul Haq, who was posted as CO, was killed
 hatya karwaane kaa aarope sapa sarkaar main taqatvar mantri or mulaayam singh yadav ke kareebi kahe jane vaale par raghuraaj pratap singh urf raja bhaiya par he

 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne somvaar ko kaha ki centre kii galat nitiyon ke kaaran aaj desh main manhagaai kii aisi sthiti he or is mudde par bayaan dene se pehle centre main jimmevaar log soch liya karen kyonki iske chalate jo pareshaani babbti he vah sabko jhelni padati he
 Nitish said that there is a provision of collective responsibility in democracy when the prices of things are going up, then the central government has to see and take steps
 unase kendriya krishi mantri sharad power ke ravivaar ko die gaye us bayaan ke bare main poocha gaya tha jisamen unhone kaha tha ki keemton par nitigat nirnay mantrimandal kii ore se samuhik rup se liya jaataa he jisamen pradhanmantri bhi shaamil hote hai
 He said, "he respects Pawar saheb a lot, the responsible people should take care of what he is saying while speaking
" ab kah diya gaya ki doodh kii keemat badhegi to ab vah nahin bhi badhati to ab bad jaaengi
 Nitish said that Pawar's statement, however, did not have an impact in Bihar as the state government has set up a cabinet sub-committee headed by Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi to keep an eye on the inflation, which would hold two-three meetings a week on the situation
 Is watching unhone kaha ki bihar sarkaar ne chini ko waite free kar diya he or bihar main chini milon ke maujuud hone ke baavjood use maharashtra se link nahin kiya janaa chahie tha

 He accused Lalu's movement of being fake and exhibiting fake revolutionaries, saying that he had been saying that his movement would continue till the prices of things reached six months ago
 nitish ne kaha ki unka andolan to hona chahie tha 2004 ke daam ko waapas laane ke liye
 When the previous NDA government left power in the country, bringing back the prices of things at that time, then inflation will be controlled

 Like the film 'singham', Patna city SP Shivdeep Lande on Sunday arrested an alleged police officer
 lekin unki is karrwai or kaaryastylee par ab sawaal bhi uthne lage hai
 Senior SP of Patna Jitendra Rana has admitted that this incident with Uttar Pradesh Police is regrettable
 rana kaa kahana he ki pulisavaale ke saath samvedansheeltaa ke saath bartaav hona chahie tha
 According to the SSP, there is no charge against the Inspector of Uttar Pradesh Police so far
 naa hi unke paas se kuch baraamad hi hua he or na to giraftaar hui he
 However, the SSP said that the investigation of the case is going on and that the matter may be correct or there may be an attempt by the businessman to interrupt the investigation
 esaspi ne bataaya ki upi police ke inspector ko shahar ke dakbangla chauraahey par pakadaa gaya or us par maine city espi se report maangi thi
 His report has come and is under review
 vyavsaai ne inspector par rishwat maangane kaa aarope to lagaaya, lekin giraftaar ke vakt inspector ke paas se kuch bhi baraamad nahin hua
 He said, only in the detail report, we will know what the whole matter is and how it happened in front of the camera
 esaspi ne bataaya ki puri report ko rajya police mukhyalay or upi police ko bhi aavashyak karrwai ke liye bheja jayega
 He said that the inspector has not been arrested
 un par koi aarope nahin lagaaya gaya he, naa hi koi maamla darj kiya gaya he
 There was no recovery from the inspector, so he was immediately released
 rana ne kaha, maanata hum ki hamaari police par sawaal uth rahe hai, kyonki jis tarah se ye camere ke saamne hua or ek pulisavaale ke saath hua vah thik nahin he
 Our department is also bound by law
 unhone kaha sarkari karmchaaree or pulicekarmi ke saath to or bhi zyada samvedansheel tareeke se bartaav hona chahie
 This may sound strange, but it is true
 bihar ke railway steshnon par mahaj 100 rupee ghoose dekar aap chahen, to kisi bhi train kaa plateform badi aasaani se badalawa sakate hai
 In common parlance, this is called platform fixing
 yah puraa maamla mujffarpur railway stesan kaa he or is puure gorakhdhandhe kaa khulaasa do din pehle hua he, jab purv madhya railway jone ke aalaa adhikariyon ke paas kuch audio recording pahunchi, jisamen mujffarpur railway stesan ke relkarmi or vahiin ke plateform par vikritaon ke bich kii baatcheet saamne ai
 In the audio recording that is being held between the railwaymen and the vendors, in which the railwayman is asking the seller, on which platform is the train to come at Muzaffarpur railway station? This audio recording makes it clear that the vendors on the platform of Muzaffarpur railway station used to bribe the railwaymen and get them to change the platform of the train according to their own, so that their sales could increase
 jo audio recording railway ke aalaa adhikariyon ke haath lagi he, usamen sabase chaunkaane vaali baat yah he ki mujffarpur stesan ke relkarmi mahaj 100 rupee ghoose lekar vikreta ke pasand ke train ke plateform ko badal diya karte the
 Rajesh Kumar, the chief public relations officer of the East Central Railway Zone, said that after the matter came to light, the Railways constituted an inquiry and what has come out in the preliminary investigation is that the train is in collusion with the railwaymen and vendors at Muzaffarpur railway station
 The platform was changed
 praarambhik jaanch main mujffarpur stesan ke teen relkarmiyon ko doshi paaya gaya he or unhen nilambit kar diya gaya he
 Audio clipping also reveals that usually the railwaymen and vendors could not change the platform of important trains, as the platform of these trains is already fixed
 aise main relkarmi or vikreta intercity express or paisanger trainon ke plateform se hi chhedchhad kiya karte the
 Railway has admitted that the operations of trains on Sonepur division have also been disrupted many times due to this fraud
 railveki visilence team philhal is puure gorakhdhandhe kii jaanch kar rahi he
 At present, the matter has been disclosed to Muzaffarpur railway station, but investigation is also going on whether this gorakhandha is happening at other railway stations as well
 It was decided that no station master will be able to change the platform of a train of his own free will and to do so he will have to take permission from the headquarters
 stesan master ko is baat kii bhi jaankaree mukhyalay ko deni hogi ki kisi train kaa plateform kyon badla gaya or kin paristhitiyon main badla gaya? The condition of the Congress to attend the all-party meeting to be held on Monday is that if the agenda of the meeting is on the issue of action on the three BJP leaders, then only they will join it
 ye baithak sarkaar kii taraf se bulaayi ja rahi he
 The Congress has been attending the all-party meeting convened by the Lok Sabha Speaker, but has been shy of such meetings called by the government
 somvaar kii baithak ke liye rajyasabha main netaa pratipaksh or congress mahasachiv ghulaam nabi azaad ne congress kii sthiti saaf kar di he
 The all-party meeting will be held on Monday at 12 o'clock
 isse pehle congress ne apni sansadeey dal kii jeneral body meeting bulaai he
 All the mps of Congress, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha will participate in it
 khud congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ise sambodhit karengi
 It will review how effective Congress' strategy has been so far in besieging the Modi government regarding Lalitgate and Vyapam and how to take it forward
 pichley hafte spikar kii teble kar placord laharaakar hangaamaa karne ke baad loksabhaa kii us din kii baaki kaarywahi se baahar kar die congressi saansad adheer ranjan choudhary ne enditivi se kaha ki hamaara aglaa qadam kya hoga ye sarkaar kaa ravvaiya dekhne ke baad tay hoga
 However, he also added that in this regard, the party will decide its strategy in general body meeting on Monday morning
 is bich sansadeey kaarymantri venkaiya naidu ne kaha he ki ve aarope pratyarope main nahin padana chaahate or congress se apil karte hai ki wo sansad ko chalane de
 Venkaiah also reiterated that Sushma Swaraj is a big leader and has done no wrong
 sansad ko roak kar congress desh kii tarakkee roak rahi he
 The government's effort is to air the rift in opposition unity and try to isolate the Congress
 jabaki congress andar hi andar ye jaanane ke baad bhi sarkaar se do do haath kar rahi he ki khaastaur par sushamaa swaraj ke istife ke sawaal par kai vipakshi partiyaan pehle din se hi uskaa saath nahin de rahi hai
 Among them, the Samajwadi Party has openly said that it is not a party behind the Congress
 uske apane mudde hai jin par sarkaar se unka virodh he
 Apart from Samajwadi Party, parties like RJD, JDU come with the demand of issuing the ethnic census in the Well of Parliament
 isi tarah tiemasi ke saansad telugana ke liye alag hoicourt jald banane kii maang ke saath, lekin shorgul main sab kuch saaf saaf sunai nahin padataa or muddon kaa placord loksabhaa tivi par dikhaai nahin padataa
 Hence the ruckus of opposition mps is taken in unison, which is not the situation
 congress virodh or gatirodh ko lekar jahaan tak pahunch gai he vahaan se vah khaali haath lautne kaa khatara nahin le sakati
 The government should take some other opposition parties and even if they are silent, the Congress cannot pull back its footsteps
 akhirkaar vah 44 saansadon ke saath hi sahi sabase badi vipakshi party kii bhoomika nibhaane kii zimmedaari bhi apane sir par lekar chal rahi he
 He should leave his protest, because some other opposition parties are doing this, many Congress strategists find it suicidal
 aise main congress ke tane rahane kii puri ummid he
 Half of the monsoon session commenced on July 21, but the impasse in Parliament for 12 days is not breaking
 sattadhari party bijepi kahati he ki sansad ne chalane ke liye congress zimmedaar he, jabaki congress kii line he ki sansad chalaanaa sarkaar kii zimmedaari he or sansad main kaamkaaj sunishchit karne ke liye use vipaksh kii baat sunani chahie
 The comments bijepi kahati he ki sarkaar bahes ko taiyaar he, lekin congress bahes se bhaag rahi he jabaki congress kahati he pehle ection ho tab discshan ho
 That is, Sushma Swaraj, Vasundhara Raje and Shivraj Singh Chauhan will let the Parliament run only after talk of action
 aakraman hi bachaav kaa sabase acha rasta he kii niti par chalati hui bijepi congress ke netaaon, mukhyamantriyon or yahaan tak kii priyanka gandhi or unke pati robert wadra par bhi hamale kar chuki he
 It also calls the Congress deadlock as killing the rights of the remaining members of Parliament
 lekin congress bijepi ko uske vipaksh ke dinon kii yaad dilaati he jab kai mauqe par bijepi ne sansad ko nahin chalane diya
 The all-party meeting will be held on Monday at 12 o'clock
 isse pehle congress ne apni sansadeey dal kii jeneral body meeting bulaai he
 All the mps of Congress, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha will participate in it
 khud congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ise sambodhit karengi

 Starting a short-term discussion in the Rajya Sabha on a statement made by Maken in both houses of Parliament last week regarding the organization of the Commonwealth Games, Leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley said that the Prime Minister had given advice by various officials of the Sports Ministry and the Prime Minister's Office Kalmadi was appointed the head of the organizing committee

 To know how Sachin Tendulkar was in the dressing room, listen to Javagal Srinath and Suresh Raina
 sachin ke saath alag-alag daur main dressing room share kar chuke in cricketron ne india today group ke conklev 'salaam sachin' main master blaster ke vyaktitv se judi kai dilachasp yaaden share kin
 Read the entire conversation with Shweta Singh
 shribhai, aapkaa pehla daura tha australia kaa
 Sachin had been a couple of years
 us dauraan ke kuch anubhav bataaie?shrinath:main sachin se pehali baar 1989 main mila tha
 There was a match in Patiala
 karnataka varsej mumbai
 Sachin could not play too many innings
 kambli ne zyada score kiya tha
 But the difference was understandable from his stroke
 phir ham australia gaye
 His status was beginning to be established
 mere liye us daure main perth ke dauraan unki centuri behad khaas he
 Playing on paces and bounced pitches in front of Bruce Reid, Michael Whitney and mcdermod
 jab pich par cracks hon
 It was awesome
 sachin sirf 19 saal ke the or unhone na sirf is atake ko counter kiya or score kiya
 We lost the match, but it was the only person who gave us the honor in that match
 jab sachin ne sauvaan shatak banaaya, to suresh raina aap duusare chor par the?suresh raina:sabase pehle main ajit bhai ko thankyuu bolnaa chahta hum, jinhone paaji ke saath itani mehnat kii
 i remember the net practice before the Bangladesh match
 dekhakar lag rahaa tha ki kuch khaas hone vaala he
 He always works hard and is full of positivity
 sachin prankster bhi hai, kya dressing room main bahut majaak karte hai?shrinath:haa zyaadaatar to syrius hi rahata he
 The weight comes as soon as he comes to the dressing room
 par use jaldi hansi nahin aati
 People used to recite jokes
 raina
 He liked Kishore Da's songs
 vah batting ke pehle or baad unka gaanaa laharon kii tarah sunate rahete the
 Everyone loved it, singing Youngster like a Guardian 
 sachin kii net practice kara rahe gendbaajon ko bahut mehnat kerani hoti he?shrinath:sachin or rahul ye hameshaa hi standard set karte rahe hai
 To me they were a true reference to your performance
 rahul ko agar line or length main gadabad dikhegi to vah ball chhod degaa, magar sachin use panish karte the
 If i and Kumble bowled well on the net to Sachin, it seemed that we were in form
 use net par bhi out karnaa kaaphi keemtee pal hota tha
 He used to make situations before ODI matches
 oke 6 ball hai, 12 ran banane hai
 During this time, if a shot goes to the fielder, everyone speaks with him, it is a surprise
 main bahes karata, par usase jeetna mushkil tha
 He started sending me as a pinch hitter under his captaincy
 1996 main vah aayaa or bolaa shri tu number teen par aa ja
 Whatever you want to do, kill it
 do teen baar is dauraan unke saath khilne kaa mauka mila
 The most special thing about Sachin is the way he reads the bowler
 har bowler kaa plan unhen pataa hota he
 So he is special
 vah zyaadaatar baar bowler kaa pattern bhaanp lete hai
 i kept looking at the other end
 phir brake main jate to vah bataate, patakegaa ball, aage daalega
 Seeing and putting or 90 fisadi baar vah sahi hote the
 When he had any idea, i would look at him and see what he had done
 to vah ishaaron main kahata, dimag tera he, tu khel na
 Talk of the Cape Town Test
 venkatesh prasad injurd ho gaya tha
 i had to throw a lot of overs
 main thakaa hua tha
 When went to batting
 to pair langadaa rahaa tha
 i was frequently moving from the stumps while playing
 sachin ko yah baat pasand nahin ai
 They interrupted me
 maine eemaandaaree se kabool liya
 He said that Mr
 i need more from you
 phir agle test main maine 42-43 ran banaae
 And when he went to the dressing room, he looked at them
 sachin bahut kam hi compcement dete hai
 Genuine
 bataur captain vah bahut taff the
 Raina when you scored the first hundred, Sachin was at the other end scoring a century, what an experience
 
 
 raina:maine paaji se poocha kaisaa wicket he, unhone kaha acha wicket he
 i said, feeling scared, the first test
 paaji bole bas 15 20 ball kaa dar he
 You did well in odis
 wo har brake main guide karte rahe or meraa debyue main centuri ho gaya
 When we returned that day, we called again the next day
 lunch kaa kya plan he
 Let's go to eat Japanese
 kabhi nahin khaaya tha
 Keep saying that this is soy sauce
 ye vasabi he
 Then the next day i called and asked, is your stomach okay? khaas maichon kii taiyaari kaise hoti he? raina: pakistan ke khilaaf unki 200 fisadi taiyaari dikhti he
 Paaji said after the toss, everything will remain the focus, we got to play the semifile
 unhone batsman or fielder ke saath van on van meeting kiya
 Yuvi Pa said
 acchhee fielding karenge
 Sachin Paaji said, he will bother them a bit
 final main gauti bhai batting kar rahe the
 Someone woke up for tea
 to sachin paaji bole ki koi uthegaa nahin, sab yaheen baithe rahenge
 Were so emotionally involved
 to world cap jeetna bahut tachi mument tha
 We reached the final in 2003 too, what was the atmosphere Mr
 Bhai? First i will talk about 1996, when we lost to Sri Lanka in the semi final in Kolkata
 match ke baad 4-5 player rone lage
 i felt that if i did not cry, my commitment would be less visible
 magar phir kuch der baar chup ho gaya
 Looked at Sachin
 wo nahin ro rahaa tha
 i told her that i can't cry
 sachin ne kaha ki ham kyon roen
 We played perfectly
 haar gaye to kya hua
 This is not the end of the world
 phir jaaenge or khelenge
 i said again, man it is fine
 dekh main abhi bhi tauliya pakade hum
 But i can't cry main ye baat nahin kah saktaa tha
 But he said clearly and we settled on our seats
 2003 ke final main hamaari bowling kharaab rahi
 Speaking of Sachin, whether he is playing on the century, or in the early stages
 chehre par shanti dikhti he
 They know how to handle their enthusiasm
 ye bahut shahi andaaj he
 Out or Century
 bahut sanyat dhang se riect karte hai
 He lived in his own world
 centuri ke baad bhi aap unako zyada laud nahin pate the
 The problem was that his century was becoming so much that he might be getting bored himself
 1996 ke aansu kii aapane baat kii
 After winning the 2011 all-cried World Cup? Raina: We were all emotional
 sara or arjuna bhi aae the us match ke liye
 When Mahi Bhai was tossing, something happened
 paaji bole ki toss ke bare main mat socho or match par dhyaan do
 After winning the World Cup, Paji called that super fan Sudhir
 team ke saath photo khinchvaaya
 He respects everyone
 net par bowling karne aate hai, to unako bataate hai
 i got an opportunity to play in Air India in the early stages
 praveen aamare sar ne mujhe milwaaya
 We all got very excited to meet for the first time
 world cap ke dauraan to ham bahut imotional the
 His fitness is still very good today
 trainer thak jate hai, lekin vah nahin thakte
 He plays table tennis very well
 pool bahut acha khelte hai
 Beat everyone in TT
 jab ham yang ladke aae, kuch gane lagaae, to paaji bole, nahin main batting karne ja rahaa hum, kishor chalegaa
 He loved Kishore's songs, especially 'like waves'
 shrinath:agar use koi gaanaa pasand aayega, to sabko pasand karavaayega
 If it does not come, then once hearing it will say, Yes, it is very good
 baad main sunuunga
 How was Sachin as a captain? Srinath: i often had to ask for the ball from Sachin
 main hameshaa lunch ke pehle or baad main ball maangata
 Say give three overs
 thik lage to ruk janaa
 He would often listen
 jab rokna hota, to na nahin kehete, bas itnaa hi bolte, do minute thahar naa
 His specialty was that he did not like to lose
 kai baar samaj hi nahin aata ki chaahate kya hai
 Once 30-40 minutes of batting, he went to the other side
 phir nai ball yaa duusari puraani ball lee or bowling karne lage
 Sometimes fast, sometimes he started spinning
 kai baar vah krij se aage aakar ball karte
 But quality was always there, he could do at will ball
 itnaa zyada involvement tha game main
 There was cricket in every blood
 net practice ke un teen ghanton main ek-ek second bas cricket ke liye hota tha
 i didn't see so much connection to the game
 shuruyaat main vah slip main khadey hote or outswing daalane ko kehete hue cheekhte, shri baahar kar na
 Exclude main kahata yaar mere ko outswinger nahin aata
 When we talked on the net
 uskaa plan hota tha ki do ball andar daal, ek baahar nikaal
 We used to argue
 kabhi ham haar jate to vah bahut niraash hota
 But when he returned as captain, he was changed
 vah zyada dhairya ke saath pesh aa rahe the
 What did you guys do when Sachin was around? Raina: We just used to change the song
 vah aate the
 Used to exchange ipads
 phir jab paaji kuch hansate the, to ham baat karte the jaakar
 Used to be very fun
 maaikel jackson ke muves ke bare main baat karte the
 He was very fond of racing
 kaaron ke bare main baat karte the
 Used to tell which oil is in which gear
 aapako pataa bhi nahin chalegaa or pressure of kar denge
 Virat bought the car
 maine kharidi, to dilli test ke baad bole ki chal vahaan noida ke racing trek main chalate hai
 Shoaib Akhtar's question was that we used to say in the team meeting that dismiss Sachin in two overs or else it would be 50 overs
 aap jab meeting karte the, to sachin mere bare main kya bolta tha ki kahaan-kahaan maarna he?raina
 He used to live in his mind
 ki jab shoeb bhai bowling karenge to cat maaroonga, flik maaroonga
 Positive Attitude
 upar vaala bhi mehnat par madad karata tha
 At the time of Sachin's retirement? Srinath: It was just and only Sachin's decision and his timing should be respected
 meri chintaa ye he ki ab vah kya karegaa
 Now he will not pick up the bat
 centuri nahin banayega
 Will go to function, can comment
 magar cricket nahin khilne vaali jo baat he
 Which is the sense of responsibility that has to be known and scored
 wo khalipan rahegaa
 How will he face it
 uski jindagi main khalipan to rahegaa hi
 i often ask, and how many days will you last
 wo bolta
 Still inside me meraa dil nahin karata cricket chhodane kaa
 Then he took this decision and called me
 main chitagaanv main tha
 i said, this is a good decision
 raina:ham unase baat karte rahete hai
 blackberry BBM is running
 tips leni hoti he, to massej karte hai
 If they are not busy, then reply comes in two minutes
 wo test par focus karnaa chaahate the
 Look at Kolkata, how many people came because of them
 abhi unhone ipel bhi jeeta
 i hope that they will motivate even further
 virendra sahvaag ke baad ab gautam gambhir bhi kandhe kii chot kii vajah se team india se baahar ho gaye hai
 Gambhir has been advised rest for 4 to 6 weeks
 gautam gambhir ko westeindies daure ke liye vanade team kii captaini saunpi gai thi
 Obviously he will not be able to go on the Caribbean tour for the ODI series
 enditivi ke paas is baat ke pukhta saboot or dastavej hai, jisase yah saaf ho jaataa he ki in khilaadiyon ko world cap ke dauraan hi chot lag gai tha, baavjood iske ve ipel main khelte gaye

 mausam vibhaag kaa kahana he ki chetavanee dene ke baavjood sarkaar ne koi dhyaan nahin diya
 Here, the state government has clarified that no such alert was received from the Meteorological Department
 'yatra roak dijie, tirthayatriyon ko baahar nikaal lijie


' aisi chetavanee di gai thi


 or yah chetavanee ai thi uttarakhand mausam vibhaag kii ore se, jis par sarkaar or prashasan ne zyada gambhirtha se dhyaan nahin diya
 These warnings were issued on 14, 15 and 16 June, in which heavy rains were alerted in the state
 uttarakhand mausam vibhaag ne rajya sarkaar ko chaar dham yatra ko rokane or tirthayatriyon ko surakshit jagahon par pahunchane kii naseehat bhi di thi
 This warning was sent to many places and many other people, but it was ignored as a routine warning

 On June 15, we again issued a warning and feared excessive rainfall and landslides
 anand sharma ne bataaya, hamane yah bhi kaha tha ki logon ko pahaado par nahin jane diya jaae or jo pahaado par hai, unhen surakshit thikaanon par le jaaya jaae

 "stop the journey, take out the pilgrims


" Such a warning was given 


 and this warning came from the Uttarakhand Meteorological Department, which the government and administration did not pay much heed to
 ye chetavanee 14, 15 or 16 june ko di gai thi, jisamen rajya main baari barish kaa alert diya gaya tha
 The Uttarakhand Meteorological Department had also asked the state government to stop the Char Dham Yatra and to bring the pilgrims to safe places
 yah chetavanee kai jagahon or or kai logon ko bheji gai thi, lekin ise routine chetavanee samaj kar isaki andekhi kii gai
 The comments uttarakhand main beshak ausat se zyada barish hui he, lekin agar mausam vibhaag kii is chetavanee par dhyaan diya jaataa, to is tabaahi se hue nuksaan ko kaaphi kam kiya ja saktaa tha
 Speaking to NDTV, Director of Uttarakhand Meteorological Department Anand Sharma said that since June 14, we were expecting heavy rains and we had informed the state government
 15 june ko hamane phir chetavanee jari kii or behad adhik barish or bhuskhalan kii ashanka jataai thi
 Anand Sharma said, We also said that people should not be allowed to go to the mountains and those who are on the mountains should be taken to safe places

 On the other hand, Rudraprayag SP Barinderjit Singh said that on receiving information from the Meteorological Department, we had announced the danger


 We had made it clear that those who are capable, go ahead in the journey there

 raajnneetik gatirodh kii vajah se teen talaak bill rajyasabha main phir latak gaya he
 In the absence of majority in Rajya Sabha, the government could not move this bill further
 vipaksh bill ko select cameti ko bhejne kii apni maang par ada hua he
 The government's attempt to get the triple talaq bill passed in the Rajya Sabha on Monday failed again
 vipaksh teen talaak bill main bade badlaav kii maang kar rahaa tha or sadan main charchaa se pehle select cameti kii maang par data rahaa
 While the government rejected the opposition's demand
 rajyasabha main vipaksh ke upanetaa anand sharma ne sarkaar par ek samvedansheel masale par raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaaya, jabaki sarkaar ne kaha ki vipaksh is baat se dar gaya he ki ye kanoon banane se muslim mahilaayein modi sarkaar kaa samarthan karengi
 Trinamool Congress leader Derek o'brien told NDTV that the government was responsible for the deadlock and wanted to pass it in the Rajya Sabha without forming a political consensus on the bill
 mahatvapurn masalon par samay-samay par sarkaar ke saath dikhne vaali AIADMK bhi bill ke virodh main he
 The party's chief VP v Satyanant told NDTV that the provision of punishment to the guilty husband in the bill is wrong and this will increase the misuse of this proposed law
 pidipi netaa mujffar beg ne enditivi se kaha ki duniya ke kisi bhi desh main civil contract ke liye sajaa kaa praavdhaan nahin he or bharat main bhi aisa nahin hona chahie
 Clearly, the government has only until 8 January to pass an ordinance issued on the triple talaq bill in Parliament
 agar sarkaar ise 8 janvari tak rajyasabha main paarit nahin kara pai to use phir se adhyadesh laane par vichaar karnaa hoga

 Bhogle said, `` While Yuvraj Singh, Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan have not been selected in the World Cup probable team, cricket lovers should assume that now they will not play for the country again and In such a situation, the contribution of these players should be appreciated

 Seeing what happened on the Ayodhya case on Tuesday, it is easily understood that Ayodhya is not a case for political parties but remains a political issue
 mangalvaar ko is masale par congress or bijepi donon ne jamkar raajnneeti shuru kii or donon partiyon kii bayaanbaji ne phir se yah saaf kiya he ki unke liye yah ek chunavi yaa raajnneetik masalaa hi he
 The truth is that both political parties are seen to be doing politics on this issue
 donon kaa hit isi main he ki yah masalaa lanbaa khinche
 Where bjp's interest is in this matter, Tempo should remain on this issue till Gujarat elections and further 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 vahiin congress shaayad yah chaahati he ki ise kisi tarah 2019 se aage tak taal diya jaae, taaki loksabhaa chanaav main bijepi ko kisi tarah kaa phayda na mil paae
 The other one does not get the benefit! That means more than building a temple or not, it is about how to take political advantage of this issue and prevent the other party from taking advantage of it
 tocongress parajahan yah ungali uth rahi he ki vah kapil sibbal ke madhyam se is masale ko taalane kii jugat bana rahi he, vahiin bijepi par bhi yah aarope lagate rahe hai ki vah itane saal se is masale ko khinchati rahi he taaki zyada se zyada raajnneetik phayda uthaaya ja sake
 Taunting the BJP, the opposing parties have been saying - 'the temple will be built there, but will not tell the date
 ' sochie agar maamle ko supreme court se hi niptaana tha to yah kaam to pehle hi kiya ja saktaa tha, is par itane saal tak andolan karne, bavaal kaatane or masalaa banane kaa phir kya phayda rahaa, sivaay iske ki itane saal tak isse bijepi ko satta milti rahi
 There was a loud commotion in the Supreme Court on Tuesday during the halt of political impact
 sarvocch adaalat main raajnneeti kaa jabardast manjar dikhaa
 The Muslim parties strongly opposed the hearing on the ground that the case was not ready
 maamle ke raajnneetik asar kaa hawala dete hue unhone kaha ki yah sunwaayee kaa uchit samay nahin he
 What is the hurry? Hearing in the case should be held in July 2019 after the general election
 unke vakeelon ne yahaan tak virodh kiya ki agar court sunwaayee jari rakhega to ve usamen hissaa nahin legein or adaalat kaksh chhod kar chale jaaenge
 After nearly two hours of noise and debate, the court postponed the hearing and after hearing of the exchange of documents, asked for a hearing again on 8 February
 muslim pakshakaron kii ore se pesh varisht vakil kapil sibbal, rajeev dhawan or dushyant dave ne sunwaayee rokane ke liye edi chotii kaa jor lagaaya
 Sibal started unhone kaha ki cese abhi sunwaayee ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 Entire documents have also not been filed
 haalanki, uttar pradesh kii ore se pesh eesg tushaar mehta ne iskaa virodh karte hue kaha ki saare anuwaad or dastavej daakhil ho gaye hai
 Such arguments cannot be given to stop the hearing
 lekin sibbal ne virodh jari rakhte hue kaha ki aise sunwaayee nahin ho sakati
 They should get four months to read thousands of documents
 unhone maamle ko ati mahatvapurn bataate hue kaha ki is cese kaa bahut zyada rajnatik asar he, isliye court ko is par 15 july 2019 se sunwaayee shuru kerani chahie
 That is, by then the general election in the country will be over

 Then the BJP became aggressive only after the action of the same allegation
 bhaajapa adhyakshmit shah necongress se yah saaf karne ko kaha ki vah bataae ki maamle main supreme court main uske netaa kapil sibbal dwaara pesh kii gai daleelein uski apni thi yaa sunni vakf board kii? unhone kaha ki mandir-mandir ghoomane vaale rahul gandhi is par apana rukh saaf karen
 On the other hand, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala retorted that the BJP should look at its history before raising a dispute on the matter
 surajevaala ne kaha, 'court main sibbal kiskaa pratinidhitiv karte hai, yah unka vyaktigat maamla he
 Congress has nothing to do with this
 bhopal gas traasadee maamle main arun jetali ji vakil the, kya iske liye puri bijepi ko jimmedaar tehraaya ja saktaa he
 'facts Important or Politics Now it will be important to see whether the Supreme Court takes action and decides on this sensitive issue on the basis of evidence, facts or looking at the political impact
 kya supreme court ko is baat se koi fark padegaa ki is masale par kya raajnneeti ho rahi he or iskaa kise phayda yaa nuksaan ho saktaa he? Police claimed to have killed 30 Naxals in an encounter between police and Naxalites in Dantewada, Chhattisgarh

 parisamvaad kaa udghaatan vaktavy prakhyat patrkaar evam maakhanlaal chaturvedi rashtriya patrakarita evam sanchaar vishvavidhyalay ke purv kulapati achyutanand mishra ne diya
 Chaired by Kamal Kishore Goenka, eminent critic and vice chairman of Central Hindi Teaching Board
 sahitya academy ke sachiv ke
 Srinivasrao welcomed the guests by offering Angavastram and book
 apane swaagat vaktavy main unhone kaha ki ek samay tha jab patrakarita or sahitya ek duusare se bal praapt karte the or ek duusare ko sanskaarit bhi karte the
 But today the situation has changed for both literature and journalism
 donon ne apni parampara chhodkar vyavsaayikta kii raah pakad lee he
 Presenting the seed statement, Arun Kumar Bhagat, member of Sahitya Akademi's Hindi counseling board, said that both literature and journalism are two sides of a coin
 donon ke liye tathy or tatva kii zarurat hoti he jo ki samaaj se hi praapt hote hai
 Referring to the folk-inspired background of both of them, he said that both of them have adopted the market-driven approach which is not only right for both but also fatal for the society
 hamen in donon ke aapasi rishton ko dobaaraa se santulit karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 In his inauguration statement, eminent journalist and former Vice Chancellor of Makhanlal Chaturvedi National Journalism and Communication University, Achuthanand Mishra said that literature is dedicated to eternal truth and has been playing an important role in the creation of man and to advance society
 patrakarita aaj sahitya se zyaada lokapriyata kaa ek madhyam ban gaya he
 Earlier all politicians and litterateurs used to fight the battle of politics through journalism, but there was no politics in their journalism
 us samay un donon kaa lakshya ek hi tha or vah tha desh kii aazaadee or ek swatantra raashtra kaa nirmaan
 That time was a period of morality and courage
 swatantraaa ke baad paristhatiyaan badalin or poonji or takanic kaa prabhaav bad gaya
 Now we have to think how we can reconcile these two in the present time so that new references to the morality of the society can be outlined
 apane adhyakshiya vaktavy main samalochak evam kendriya hindi shikshan mandal ke upaadhyaksh camel kishor goyanka ne kaha ki sahitya ne patrakarita ko hameshaa naitikta kaa bal diya he or usne hameshaa samaaj ke saath ek samvaad kii prakriya banaae rakhi he
 Commenting on the literature and journalism of different ideologies, he said that at such a time, our ideological commitment should be for the national interest
 unhone patrakarita or sahitya ke sangam par bal dete hue kaha ki agar ham patrakarita se sahitya ko nikaal denge to yah ek tarah se manushyata ko baahar nikaal dene kii tarah hoga
 The inaugural session was moderated by Hindi editor Anupam Tiwari
 parisamvaad ke pratham satr kii adhyakshata hindustani acedemi ke adhyaksh udai pratap singh ne kii or kumud sharma, udai kumaar evam avanijesh avasthi ne apane vaktavy prastut kiye
 Eminent journalist Udaya Kumar said that literature has improved the language of journalism
 patrakarita ko agar apane puraane sanskaron ko paanaa he to use sahitya kaa poshan karnaa hi hoga
 Literature always makes journalism beneficial and sensitive towards society
 lokhit ke liye patrakarita or sahitya ko milakar kaam karnaa hoga
 Media analyst Kumud Sharma said that over time both genres have abandoned their rich traditions and both genres have been imprisoned in large media houses
 ab unki drushti mishan kendrit nahin balki bazaar kii ore he
 He also put the current literature in the dock and said that litterateurs should think what they are creating and how readable it is! In his presidential statement, Uday Pratap Singh said that journalism and literature can never be separated because both are one Have been disciplining the other
 vartmaan main donon ke bich talmail na hone ke kaaran ye donon hi apane lakshya se bhatak gaye hai or samaaj ko kuch bhi nahin de paa rahe hai
 Emphasizing the need for mutual coordination between the two, he said that both these genres can achieve their lost popularity only through balance and cooperation
 parisamvaad ke antim satr kii adhyakshata anil kumaar raay ne kii or ashok kumaar jyoti, jitendra vir kalra, kiran chopra ne apane vaktavy die
 First media analyst Ashok Kumar Jyoti said that in literature there is an element of condolence whereas in journalism the description of the incident
 atah patrakarita hameshaa yatharth ko prastut karti he or sahitya kalpana kaa sahaara letaa he
 There is always the danger of honesty in both
 media vishleshak jitendra vir kalra ne kaha ki donon madhyamon main samvednaa or sajagata kaa santulit mishran hona bahut zaruri he
 Kiran Chopra, associated with the 'punjab Kesari' newspaper, underlined the unbreakable relationship between literature and journalism, saying that at the present time both of them dominate professionalism while at one time they were used as a mission
 satr ke adhyaksh, mahatma gandhi kendriya vishvavidhyalay ke pratikulapati anil kumaar raay ne kaha ki vartmaan main sahitya or patrakarita ke swaroop or uddeshy donon badal gaye hai or sahitya to chhodie sajag patrakarita ko bhi saans lene main mushkil ho rahi he
 We have to make new standards of literature and journalism at present
 kaarykram kaa prarambh deep prajvalan ke saath hua or isamen vibhinn vishvavidhyalayon ke patrakarita or sahitya vibhaagon se aae praadhyaapak, shodharthi chaatr-chatraayen evam sahityakar va patrkaar baari sankhya main upasthiti the
 Arun Kumar Bhagat proposed a vote of thanks at the end of the program
 jammu kashmir ke pulavama main hue hamale ke baad se hi deshbhar main rosh, aakrosh, shok or gusse kii lahar he
 Most of the Central Reserve Police Force personnel were returning to duty after the holidays and this tragic and terrible incident happened to them

 In Bollywood, the unique circumstances of the Indian Army have been shown on the silver screen, apart from this there are many advertisements which have tried to show the soldiers' dedication and passion for the country
 haalanki in vigyapanon par kai baar sena kaa sahaara lekar commershializeshan ke aarope bhi lage hai
 But it is also true that with the help of these advertisements, the charismatic life of Indian soldiers also makes a big section of the country aware
 'vigyapanon ko jaankaree jaisaa nahin laganaa chahie balki unhen ek bharosemand vaayade kii tarah prathit hona chahie
 'on the lines of this statement, there are some such eds in which we can see different colors of the Indian Army
 1
 In this advertisement for Fortune, Akshay Kumar can be seen spending time with soldiers
 baatcheet se saaf jaahir hota he ki zyaadaatar jawan ghar ke khaane ko kaaphi miss karte hai
 Akshay aka Rajiv Bhatia cooks for all these jawans
 wo ye bhi kehete hai ki actor banane se pehle unhone kaaphi rotiyaan beli hai
 Actually, Akshay has also worked as a chef before becoming an actor
 2
 It can be considered one of the best advertisements made on the Indian Army
 is aid ke sahare coca cola ne bhartiya sena ko tribut diya he
 Whether it is the scorching heat of Jaisalmer or the shivering cold of Kashmir, a soldier is never afraid of his duty
 isi theme par kerala kaa ek jawan kashmir se hote hue jaisalmer pahunchataa he
 There, he reaches his family with the message of his partner's martyrdom and then leaves for his house
 haalanki kuch hi der main use desh kii raksha ke liye waapas janaa padataa he
 The amazing shots of Kerala, Kashmir and Jaisalmer add to the cinematic appeal of this advertisement and 'saare Jahan Se Achchha', playing on a guitar tune in the background, has the potential to make any human emotional
 3
 This ad from Hyundai Santro has been given a lot of emotional touch and is also a very popular advertisement
 vigyaapan main 'rang de basanti' fame actor atul kulkarni ek army officer kii bhoomika main nazar aae

 haalanki ek sentro car chaalak unase miltaa he or apana intervyuu chhodkar army jawan ko samay par pahunchaata he
 The essence of this advertisement was - 'first of all, who is going on duty of the country, do duty
 '4
 Army personnel not only bear responsibility for themselves but they are also responsible for crores of people of the country

 5

 While on the occasion of festivals, the common man is celebrating them with their families, while the Indian soldiers are celebrating their duties on the border
 bhartiya sena ke pariwaron kii sthiti kitni asamanjas bhari hoti he, ye us bayaan se saaf ho jaataa he jab ek mahila kahati hai ki kabhi kabhi to lagata he ki unka phone ring hi naa ho
 Clearly, the families who are living as inaccessible lives on the outskirts, their families have to be two to four due to difficult situations
 6
 In this action-packed advertisement, some army personnel are struggling to save some children amidst heavy rains and deluge
 tabhi vahaan maujuud ek aurat ek shaks se madad maangati he jo bajaj kii bike par savaar he
 The advertisement may be of Bajaj bike, but seeing this ad, it is clear once again that in the event of a terrible disaster, the government and the country first looks at the army
 7
 In this advertisement of Fortune, the union of mothers and their military children is seen
 border par tainaat in bacchon se milane ko tarasati maanen jab apane bacchon ke liye fevorett dish taiyaar karti hai or apane bacchon se milti hai to unke chehron par khushi dekhne laayak hoti he
 8
 bhartiya army kii shaareerik or maansik takat kaa varnan karte is vigyaapan main dikhaaya gaya he ki kaise mahatvapurn oparations ke dauraan sainik or jawan uhapoh or udhedbun kii sthiti main hote hai or ve kaise is sthiti se paar pate hai
 Like every normal person, he too is reminded of his home and family, but for these soldiers who have completely dedicated their lives to the country, only the country has become their family
 9
 'how many seasons pass from the border of the country to the threshold of the house' When a young man reaches his home after serving the country for a long time, then many things have changed in his family
 parle ji kaa ye vigyaapan parivaar ke saath mahatvapurn maukon par na uplabdh rahane kii usee kasak ko bayaan karata he
 How complex the mood of an army jawan and his family is can also be understood from this ed
 parle ji ne is vigyaapan ko ganatantr diwas ke din release kar ise bhartiya sena ko dedicket kiya tha
 10
 sena ke ek jawan kii bas chhot jaati he or ek shaks apni bike ko bas ke saamne laga detaa he jisase bas ruk jaati he
 This person kills this army soldier and the people sitting in the bus also salute him
 hero company ke is vigyaapan ke sahare desh kii suraksha main lage lakhon sainikon ko ek tribut dene kii koshish kii gai he

 Let me tell you, in the ICJ elections held recently, there was a contest between Dalveer Bhandari of India and Christopher Greenwood of Britain, which was inconclusive
 ab tak 11 round ke chunaav ho chuke hai, lekin donon hi pratyaashiyon ko jarurat ke hisaab se vot nahin mil paae
 Let me tell you, for the appointment of a judge in the ICJ, the candidate has to get 97 votes in the United Nations General Assembly and 8 votes from the Security Council
 chunaav ko lekar hogi meetingauan general assembly ke spoxperson brendan verma ne kaha- 'general assembly chunaav ko lekar phir se mulaakaat karegi
 The meeting date will be announced soon
 ab tak 11 round chunaav ho chuke hai, lekin donon hi pratyaashiyon ne jarurat ke hisaab se mat hasil nahin kiye hai
 One-third of the 15-member bench of the ICJ is elected every three years for nine years
 iske liye sanyukt raashtra mahasabha or suraksha parishad main alag alag lekin ek hi samay chunaav karaae jate hai
 Four out of the total six candidates who contested for election in the ICJ were elected after getting an absolute majority in both the General Assembly and the Security Council
 inamen france ke roni abraham, somalia ke abdulkavi ahamed yusuf, brazil ke antonio agaste kaankado trindaade or lebanon ke nawaf salaaf shaamil hai
 In such a situation, there was a contest between Bhandari and British candidate Christopher Greenwood for a post of judge
 yahaan is ek seat ko lekar 11 round ke chunaav ho chuke hai, jahaan bhandari ne sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main apana vot 115 se badhaakar 121 kiya, jabaki greenwood kaa kul vot 76 se ghatakar somvaar ko 68 par pahunch gaya
 However, the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council has been postponed
 bataa den, britain suraksha parishad kaa sthaayee sadsy he
 Because of this, Greenwood received more votes than Bhandari

 However, this has never happened in India
 ab junior str kii res ke bahaane isaki pahal kii he je ke motorsports ne
 For this, talks have started with the state government and the ball is now in the court of security agencies
 motorsports kii duniya ko narayan kartikeyan or karun chandok jaise epa-1 driver de chuki is company ne saal 2013 ke racing calendar kaa elaan kiya to usamen kai chaunkaane vaale faisle the
 For example, in India, instead of the Asia series launched two years ago, starting a series called BMW India in which only Indian drivers will participate
 company ke motorsports head sanjay sharma ke mutabik, do saal main hamane asia or europe main res kaa aayojan kiya lekin vahaan do-teen bhartiya drivers ko hi mauka mil paata tha
 Anyway, by organizing races abroad and spending crores of rupees on the exposure of foreign drivers, it is better to organize the race in your own country with international level technology so that Indian drivers can learn more and more
 iske liye jaani maani racing car company eurointernational se qaraar kiya gaya he jo 1
 Will make cars with 2 liter BMW engines for drivers

 Firebrand MP Asaduddin Owaisi on Thursday compared the discussion in the Lok Sabha regarding the triple talaq bill with the Babri Masjid demolition incident
 ol india majalis e ittehadul muslamin ke adhyaksh asaduddin ovaisi ne india today se kaha he ki is dauraan loksabhaa kaa maahaul 6 disambar, 1992 kii tarah tha
 He said that we can neither forget on December 6 nor will we forget the scene of last Thursday in Lok Sabha
 kade virodh ke baad bhi loksabhaa main teen talaak bill ke paas hone ke sawaal par ovaisi ne kaha, 'agar koi muslim vyakti apni patni ko teen baar talaak kahkar chhod detaa he, to vah aparaadh he or ise roka janaa chahie
 But no such facts or figures exist to support the fact that it is a social evil that harms society
 'hyderabad se teen baar ke loksabhaa saansad ovaisi ne teen talaak bill main teen saal kii jail kii sajaa par bhi sawaal uthaaya
 He said, 'the Supreme Court has said in its judgment that marriage will not end by just saying three divorces, so what is the need for three years of jail for it? We have many laws to provide protection to women, including sections 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Sections 20 and 22 under the Domestic Violence Act 2005 and the Muslim Women (protection of Rights on Divorce) Act 1986
 
 'ovaisi ne teen talaak bill main sajaa ke taur par teen saal kii jail dene kaa virodh karte hue sawaal kiya ki teen talaak kehane par jail bheje jane vaale vyakti kii patni ko bhatta yaa muaavja kaise milegaa?'ovaisi ne kaha ki unhone teen talaak bill main unmoolan or tyaag karne ke praavdhaanon main sanshodhan ke liye suzav diya tha, jise sire se khaarij kar diya gaya
 He said, 'the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rejected my amendment suggestion for their selfishness, while the Congress wants to prove that it is more Hindu supporter than BJP
 'supreme court ke faisle ke baavjood, muslim vyakti teen baar talaak kahkar apni patniyon ko chhod rahe hai
 When asked, why are they in opposition to a bill ending three divorce cases? So he said, '80% non-muslim women are involved in court cases under Section 498A of the IPC and the Domestic Violence Act
 'haalanki, unhone is baat par sahmati jataai ki muslim mahilaon ko shiksha or naukari milani chahie
 He also demanded seven percent reservation for educated women
 unhone kaha ki agar sarkaar ko ko lagata he ki muslim mahilaon ko shikshit kiya janaa chahie, to unhen aarakshan de dena chahie
 Questioning the triple talaq bill, he said that what is the guarantee that after the enactment of this bill, Muslim women will get justice
 iskaa khaatmaa kanoon ke dwaara nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Asked that if the Dowry Act, Domestic Violence Act, Vishaka Guidelines and other laws have been passed for the protection and empowerment of women, then why cannot the Muslim Personal Law be changed? jawaab main unhone kaha, 'kyonki dhara 25 ke tahat hamaare paas sanvaidhanik adhikaar hai
 He said that all parties have been exposed
 dharmanirpekshata par unke vichaaron kaa pardaafash ho gaya he
 Owaisi also denied that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a supporter of Muslim women
 unhone kaha ki modi muslim vot ko khone se darate hai

 This is one such Lok Sabha seat in Haryana on which the Bharatiya Janata Party has never won
 is baar haryana main chunaav se purv koi bada gathbandhan nahin hone se parinaam chaunkaane vaale ho sakate hai
 Apart from politics, the city of Hisar has its own distinct identity
 yah shahar bharat kaa sabase bada jasti loha kaa utpaadak he, jisase ise ispaat kaa shahar bhi kaha jaataa he
 Despite the Modi wave in the 2014 mandate, the Bharatiya Janata Party's grip on the Hisar seat was loosened in 2014
 is seat par indian neshnal lokdal (INLD) ke dushyant chautaala ne haryana janhit congress (HJC BL) ke kuldeep bishnoi ko haraaya tha
 In 2014 elections there was an alliance between BJP and (HJC BL)

 The INLD is now occupied by Abhay Chautala, then Dushyant Chautala along with his father Ajay Singh Chautala and brother Digvijay Chautala has formed a new party called Jananayak Janata Party (JJP)
 darasal, om prakaash chautaal ke parivaar main kalah ke baad dushyant chautaala ko lokdal se nikaal diya gaya tha, jiske baad unhone 9 disambar 2018 ko jananaayak janata party banaai

 But there is a possibility of loss to both of them in 2019 due to split in the family
 aise main bijepi or congress kii raah aasaan ho sakati he
 Before the 2014 elections, Hisar was considered a stronghold of former Chief Minister Bhajan Lal and his son Kuldeep Bishnoi
 hisar loksabhaa ke daayre main 9 vidhansabha kshetra aate hai
 As per the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, a total of 11,94,689 voters exercised their franchise in Hisar
 jisamen 6,53,423 purush or 5,41,266 mahila voters kii sankhya thi
 In 2014, a total of 1202 polling booths were built inside the Hisar Lok Sabha

 At the same time, Dushyant has used about 80 percent of his MP fund
 ek tarah se dushyant chautaala ke raajnneetik safar kii shuruyaat ko shandaar kah sakate hai
 But in 2014, they had many challenges
 26 saal kii umr main anubhavheen dushyant chautaala ke liye hisar se chunaav ladanaa ek kathin pariksha thi
 Because the candidate of the coalition riding on the Modi wave was Kuldeep Bishnoi
 aise main kuldeep ko chunaav haraana aasaan nahin tha
 But Dushyant won
 dushyant chautaala kaa janm 3 april 1988 ko hua tha

 Looking at the videos shared on the social media of Bollywood star Akshay Kumar, one thing is special that he does not forget to say Jai Hind in the end
 haal hi main jab bangaloru kii ghatana par akshay ne apni raay rakhi tab bhi unhone aisa hi kiya
 Obviously, this proves how much Akshay loves his country
 lekin aapako yah jaanakar aashcharya ho saktaa he ki kai bollywood filmon main deshbhakt kii bhoomika nibhaane vaale akshay kumaar 'bhartiya naagarik' nahin hai
 Akshay Kumar is a Canadian citizen
 haalanki, akshay ke bare main ye jaankaree pehle hi media main publish hui he
 First, in April 2016, it was reported that Akshay was detained at Heathrow Airport in England
 tabhi kai bhartiya logon ko pehali baar pataa chalaa ki ve ek canadai naagarik hai or unke paas canada kaa passport he
 Secondly, on the release of the film 'rustom', it was published in India Today that Akshay Kumar, like the commander KM Nanavati, is a Canadian citizen
 baavjood iske unke kaaphi phans iske waakif nahin hai
 On taking citizenship of another country, the citizenship of India is canceled
 In an old report published in The Economist, Akshay Kumar said that he has dual citizenship
 lekin bhartiya kanoon ke tahat koi bhartiya do deshon kaa ek saath naagarik nahin ho saktaa
 Indian citizenship is dismissed as soon as it takes citizenship of another country
 Consulate General of India kiek websitake mutabik, saath hi aisa karne vaale ko apana bhartiya passport anivaary taur par jamaa bhi karana padataa he
 Failure to do so also provides for fine
 kya sochate hai akshay canada ke bare menek pratishthit patrika ko die intervyuu main akshay ne kaha tha- 'main is jagah ko (canada) ko sach main pyaar karata hum, khuli jagah, khubasurat vaadi, chaudee or saaf sadaken
 It is completely opposite from India
 lekin main bharat ko bhi pyaar karata hum
 i am honored to have a doctorate from the Windsor University in Canada
 'voting kaa adhikaar nahinhaalanki, canadai naagarikta lene ke baad akshay kumaar 'oversij citijan of india' ho sakate hai
 Although the 'overseas Citizen' gets the right to live in India, it does not have the right to vote or to contest elections
