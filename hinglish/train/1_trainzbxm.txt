 chhattisgarh main sarkari skulon ke chaatro ko online tareeke se PET or PMT kii koching dene kaa system fail ho gaya he
 The situation is that 28 thousand students were given coaching through this system, on this, 18 crore rupees have been spent from the government treasury
 lekin ek bhi chaatr ko na to PMT main sthaan mila or na hi PET main
 Now fingers are being raised about this system
 unki daleel he ki sarkari dharre or gaiyr peshewar tareeke se iskaa sanchaalan hone ke chalate chaatro kaa sirf samay barbaad hua he
 The Edusat system and its objective was to develop the system eight years ago in the State Educational Research and Training Council SCERT due to lack of PCM ie Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics teachers in government schools
 iske tahat kareeb dhai sau skulon ke ek vishesh kamare ko hitech koching room main tabdeel kiya gaya tha
 Projector, computer and internet facility was provided here
 satellite ke jariye chaatro ko PCM kii padhai ke alaava PET or PMT kii koching di jaati thi
 The teacher, principal and the co-ordinator were paid separately for this coaching
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ek centre par salanaa chah lakh rupe kharch hote the

 According to Dipankar Bhowmik, Edusat in-charge, children were benefiting from this system
 prasaaran jald shuru karne par jor dete hue unhone kaha ki adhikariyon se baatcheet chal rahi he
 The loss of government money is not that many students of government schools have not been selected in PET and PMT in these years
 sarkari skulon ke senkado chaatro ne in saalon main PET or PMT main baaji maari, lekin unhone nijee koching sansthaao main adhyayan kiya
 The Edusat system has a large pool of students who have taken coaching here
 lekin 28 hajaar chaatro kii list main ek bhi chaatr aisa nahin paaya gaya jo ki, PET yaa PMT main silect hua ho
 Educationists are demanding that this scheme is spoiling students' time apart from just government money
 isse behatar he ki usee rakam se chaatro ko vishesh shikshako ke jariye koching karai jaae

 Kareena says that she will not take a break from work even after the baby arrives and will be active in her work
 lekin Kareena Kapoor Khan, kya sach main ye itnaa aasaan ho paaegaa jitna abhi lag rahaa he
 According to statistics, becoming a mother is a full-time job because after becoming a mother, life's priorities change drastically
 aaie jaane, nai maa se jude kuch tathy jo aapako bhi hairaan kar denge
 
 
 1
 maa banane se pehle aapane jo planning kii hoti he, usamen or maa banane ke baad kii hakeekat main bahut antar hota he
 2
 sabase zyada khalal aapaki neend par hi padataa haior shuruyaat ke 9 maheene to aapaki khud kaa koi routine nahin rahata
 3
 kariyar ke saathhi paison kii majbootee bhi kam ho jaati he
 Statistics show that after becoming a mother, women's salary growth decreases
 4
 Managing both child and work is not easy
 or ye samasya to har jagah he
 5
 bachche kii dekhbhaal se judi samasyaon kii vajah se adhiktar mahilaayein apana kariyar khatm kar detii hai
 6
 bachche kii dekhbhaal main maa ko dena padataa he apanaakeemtee vakt
 Obviously, this is difficult to manage with jobs
 7
 Home work is also necessary along with the child
 8
 Feeding a child is not a child's play

 Being a mother is a huge responsibility and it is not really easy to fulfill it
 hetric se kuch nahin hota
 The hat-trick has also been done by Naveen Patnaik
 vikaas bhi lokapriyata kaa kaaran nahin
 Senior BJP leader Uma Bharti interacted with Rahul Kanwal, managing editor of Headlines Today, on Aaj Tak channel's Sidhi Baat program
 pesh hai, baatcheet ke pramukh ansh
 Rajnath Singh (BJP President) gave a statement that India should withdraw its ambassador from Pakistan
 sarkaar ne kaha ki isse koi samaadhaan nahin nikalegaa
 Should the dialogue between the two countries continue? Rajnath Singh is right
 pakistan kuch bhi karata rahe or bharat apni ek bhi baat na manavaa sake, aisa nahin hona chahie
 Whether it is about Hemraj's severed head or Sarabjit's
 bharat ko sakht rukh apnaanaa hoga
 Regarding China, the government is saying that BJP is provoking the people
 aisi chijen to border par hoti rahati hai
 Nehru ji was also deceived
 unhen lagata tha ki china aisa nahin kar saktaa
 We are not saying to fight China
 ham kah rahe hai ki jawaab do
 The attitude of the government has deteriorated the morale of our army
 ashok singhl ne kaha ki nehru ke baad agar itani lokapriyata kisi kii bani he to vah modi kii he
 What do you think? Whether or not Modi becomes Prime Minister will be discussed in the party forum
 par aaj kii jo sthitiyaan hai uski vajah se modi lokapriy ho gaye hai
 Nothing happens with a hat-trick
 hetric naveen patnayak kii bhi hui he
 Development in the state is also not a reason for popularity because there are many other states in which development has taken place
 par acchhee gavarnence ke saath deveopment kaa mail gujarat main he
 That is why it is a unique state
 par aaj bhi muslim samudaay main khauf he ki modi aa gaye to unka kya hoga?aapako pataa he ki (gujarat main 2002 main) hindu kitne mare? dange main or police kii goli se 1,500 hindu mare the
 But why is it only when a Muslim dies? There are many leaders like Nitish Kumar who believe that Modi is not secular
 agar popular netaa hai to sabhi ko sweekaar hone chahie
 Only Hindutva leaders will be able to guarantee security to Muslims
 hindutv virdohi netaa musalamaanon kaa paksh lete rahenge, isse musalamaanon ke man main suraksha paidaa nahin hoti
 Muslims in Gujarat never complain that they are in trouble there
 par ye vahi netaa hai, jinke rahete dange hue
 Riots should not be compared
 maliana main bhi danga hua tha, ’84 ke dange bhi nahin bhuule ja sakate
 But the problem is that you do not count Sikhs and Hindus
 nitish kumaar kyon modi ke naam ko sweekaar nahin karnaa chaahate?main patna jaaoongi, unase baat karuungi ki aisa kya hua he? ram or roti saath chal sakate hai
 The way Rajnath Singh has coordinated everything
 uske baad lagata he ki hamaare or nitish ke bich koi takaraav nahin ho saktaa
 But i also think that now the country will not run with the symbol of cap and tilak
 logon ko yah dekhnaa jaruri he ki netaa unke bacchon, mahilaon or khud unke swasthya ke liye kya kar rahe hai
 According to you, if a BJP government is formed, then it will not be an issue to build a temple in Ayodhya? Ram will not be the focus, there will be bread? There will be both

 Despite both of us being one, news is coming in the media about ticket distribution, Sachin Pilot and Ashok Gehlot are not being formed
 gahalot ne kaha ki media main managasaint khabaren bana kar failaai ja rahi he
 All this is being done by the above instructions but both Sachin Pilot and we are together and together we will defeat BJP
 media par bhadakte gahalot ko dekhakar peeche khadey sachin payalat ne ashok gahalot ke andaaj main kaha ki is maukey par ek baat kahkar baat khatm chahta hum ki ashok ji main aapse dur nahin hum
 This dialogue has been a topic of discussion in Rajasthan politics
 rajasthan main jab koun banegaa mukhyamantri ko lekar mudda gahalot or sachin ke bich mudda garm tha to ashok gahalot yahi kahkar press conferes khatm karte the ki main rajasthan ke logon ko kahana chahta hum ki main aapse dur nahin
 When Ashok Gehlot was called to Delhi by making him the Congress general secretary of the organization, it was being said that now Gehlot will be active in Delhi politics
 tab gahalot ne udaipur or jodhpur main pehali baar main bolaa tha ki main rajasthan kii janata ko kahana chahta hum ki main thaan suun(aapse) dur nahi
 And then he kept speaking this dialag until he became the Chief Minister
 is baar sachin payalat ne yah dialog rajasthani main nahin balki hindi main doharaaya he jiske myne nikaale ja rahe hai

 Women's rights groups have rejected the central government's ordinance on rape laws, saying that it has included only the selective recommendations of the Justice Verma Commission
 unhone ek sanyukt bayaan main kaha ki sarkaar ne puri tarah se paardarshita kii kami barti or ham raashtrapati se aagrah karte hai ki vah aise adhyadesh par hastakshar nahin karen

 The ordinance also does nothing on the recommendation of the Verma Commission to prevent politicians facing sexual offenses from contesting elections
 justise verma ayog ne suzav diya tha ki vaivaahik balaatkaar ko aparaadh mana jaae, jo ki mahila adhikaar kaaryakartaaon kii pramukh maangon main se ek he
 The government rejected the recommendation of the Verma Committee on Armed Forces Privilege Act that if the armed forces are found guilty of crimes against a woman, no sanction will be required
 lekin sarkaar ne is kanoon ko mahilanmukhi banaate hue yah suzav diya he ki yon aparaadh kii peedit kaa bayaan keval mahila police adhikari hi legi

 It is noteworthy that the government on Friday approved the ordinance to toughen and amend the law for crimes against women, which provides for the death penalty in very serious cases, but marital rape and the controversial Armed Forces Special The Justice Varma Commission's recommendations on the Powers Act (AFSPA) have been ignored
 adhyadesh main yon aparaadhon kaa saamana kar rahe rajanetaaon ko chunaav ladane se rokane sambandhi verma ayog kii sifarish par bhi kuch nahin kayaa gaya he
 The Justice Verma Commission had suggested that marital rape be considered a crime, which is one of the major demands of women rights activists
 sarkaar ne sashastr bal visheshadhikaar kanoon par verma samiti kii yah sifarish naamanzoor kar di ki yadi sashastr bal ke jawan mahila ke khilaaf aparaadh ke aaropee paae jate hai, to kisi manjuuri kii jarurat nahin hogi
 But the government has made this law very dignified and suggested that only the woman police officer will take the statement of the victim of sexual offense

 Will go
 yah sting al jajira channel ne kiya he or jin maichon par sawaal uthaaya ja rahaa he ve bharat or srilanka ke bich galle main 26 se 29 july 2017 tak hua test, bharat or australia ke bich ranchi main 16 se 20 march 2017 tak hua test or bharat tathaa england ke bich chennai main 16 se 20 disambar 2016 tak hua test shaamil he
 India had won the Tests in Gaul and Chennai, while the match in Ranchi was evenly matched
 bisisiai ke varisht padaadhikari ne pitiai se kaha, ‘hamaara maananaa he ki isisi ne jaanch shuru kar di he
 Let them complete the investigation and convict Morris
 faisla aane ke baad hi bisisiai karrwai karegaa
 He also said that Morris, who played 42 First Class and 51 list-a matches, was not currently involved in any BCCI project
 adhikari ne kaha, ‘hamen apni bhrashtachar rodhi ikai (asiu) se pataa karne kii jarurat he ki morris kaa naam sandigdhon kii suchi main shaamil he yaa nahin
 Secondly, he is not associated with the project of BCCI or any state unit from where it needs to be removed
 ’unhone kaha, ‘ab jo cheez bachi he vah bisisiai kii gharelu cricketron ko di jane vaali 22500 rupee (katautee ke baad) kii pension he
 The BCCI has the right to revoke it but after it is found guilty
 ’galle main bharat-srilanka test fiks hone kaa daawa, ICC ne shuru kii jaanchamoris ne kathith taur kisi bhi tarah ke galat kaary se inkaar kiya he or shadyantr kii baat kahi he
 In this documentary, Morris, accused of match-fixing, is shown introducing Gaul curator Tharanga Indica to an undercover reporter and is seen claiming to have changed pitches according to the fixers
 isisi ne is maamle kii jaanch shuru kar di he
 In this video, Morris is allegedly shown with Pakistani cricketer Hasan Raza (the youngest Test cricketer's world record holder) and in the video he talks about his contacts and his ability to fix pitches through fielders

 mumbai kaa cricket jagat haalanki morris ke khilaaf aaropon se puri tarah se stabdh nahin he
 Morris, who studied at Shardashram School and was a disciple of Ramakant Achrekar (sachin Tendulkar's early coach), was considered a great limited-over cricketer, but retired from cricket at the age of 31
 mumbai cricket se jude ek vyakti ne kaha, ‘agar uske sarvshereshth din ipel ke aasapaas hote to vah gharelu khilaadiyon ke bich acchhee pasand hota
 But he went into the rebel (now disbanded) Indian Cricket League after taking eight wickets for Mumbai in the Irani Trophy
 ’kaaphi logon ko samaj nahin aata ki madhyam varg ke parivaar se hone ke baavjood morris ne bharat petroleum kii surakshit naukari kyon chhod di
 a close friend of this former cricketer said, 'I can bet that he did not earn a lot while playing domestic cricket and ICL

 "A former cricketer who played Dileep and Deodhar Trophy with Morris said," Some of his old friends started distanceing from him
 uski lagaataar dubai kii yatraaon ne andeh paidaa kiya
 'since the controversy surfaced yesterday, Morris has switched off his mobile and deleted his Facebook account
 aath saal pehle 2011 main nai dilli railway stesan ke baahar dhai foot ke ek bag ke andar se paanch foot kii ek ladki kii laash mili thi
 The police get information about the murderer after a long investigation
 par sirf jaankaree hi milti he
 Not a murderer kaatil kii talash main police kai chote-bade shaharon main chaape maarthi he
 Even the reward of two lakhs is given to the person giving the slayer's address
 par koi phayda nahin
 But then after eight long years, suddenly a killer himself calls for the first time
 us kaatil ne dhai foot ke bag main paanch foot kii laash rakhi thi
 He left the bag at the New Delhi railway station
 dilli police kii team aath saal tak us anjaan kaatil dhundti rahi
 And he changed his name to work in Gurugram for eight years
 aath saal baad jab wo mar rahaa tha, tab police ko uski khabar mili
 But he died before the police could arrest him
 tatu girl ke qatl or qatl ke anjaam kii ye ek ajeeb daastaan he
 Do you remember that bag? Yes yes kaale rang kaa vahi bag, jo 11 farvari 2011 ko dilli kii sabase bheedbhad vaali jagah yani nai dilli railway stesan ke baahar se mila tha
 This bag was opened by the policemen in front of the media
 mahaj dhai foot ke is bag ke andar paanch foot kii ek ladki kii laash mili thi
 Whose age was around 20 years
 kaali genes or kaali tii-shart pahani ladki ke donon haath uske donon pairon ke bich daalkar naylon kii rassi se is tarah baandha gaya tha taaki use aasaani se is bag main daalaa ja sake
 He was wearing a naval ring on the navel
 jabaki qamar par dahini taraf mor kaa tatu bhi bana hua tha
 The picture was in front of a clean face
 akhabaaron or tivi main baar-baar tasviir dikhaai gai
 But the surprising thing was that no one was coming forward to identify the girl
 aakhirkaar 13 din baad yani 24 farvari 2011 ko ek shaks police ke paas aata he or bataata he ki laash jis ladki kii he uskaa naam nitu solanki he
 Neetu, who works in IBS, had also contested the Delhi University Students' Union
 nitu kii laash kii shinaakht koi or nahin uske pita kartaar singh solanki karte hai
 Although he was surprised that Neetu should have been in Singapore by law, but how his body was found in Delhi? Well after the identification of the corpse, the police get the first floor
 ab laash ke bag main jane or laash ko bag tak pahunchane vaale kii talash thi
 As the investigation progresses, a name comes up Raju Gehlot
 dilli kaa hi rahane vaala raju gahalout
 Who then worked in Air India
 jisaki dosti nitu ke saath thi
 Even both of them later started living in Live Inn
 magar nitu ke ghar waalon ko ye baat nahin pataa thi
 Because Neetu had told this at home that her job has been taken up in Singapore and she is in Singapore
 nitu kii laash milane ke baad se hi raju gahalout gaayab tha
 Somehow a friend of his got caught by the police
 usee ne police ko bataaya ki nitu kaa katl raju ne kiya tha
 Now the police start wandering in search of Raju
 cese krime branch ko saunp diya jaataa he
 With the passage of time, when Raju's clue is not found, a reward of two lakh rupees is announced on him
 is bich krime branch kii team raju kii khoj main aadha hindustan gum aati he
 But Raju is not available
 aath saal biit jate hai
 One day after eight years
 
 a call comes to the Gehlot family
 phone karne vaala apana naam raju gahalout bataata he
 The Gahlaut family was listening to Raju's voice after eight years
 kyonki aath saal se raju gahalout kabhi apane ghar nahin gaya tha
 For eight years, he had never spoken to his family over phone
 aath saal baad aae is phone ko sunate hi puraa gahalout parivaar bhaagta hua gurugram ke paras hastipat pahunchataa he
 Because Raju Gehlot made the call from this hospital
 darasal, raju maut kii dahalij par khadaa tha
 An instant of breath was going to break
 par wo marane se pehle apni maa ko dekhnaa chahta tha
 That is why after eight years he called his mother
 idhar, raju gahalout ko dekhne ghar vaale aspataal pahunchate hai
 Meanwhile, a man from the Gehlot family calls the Crime Branch of Delhi Police and informs Raju about his being in Paras Hospital by phone
 aath saal se jis raju ko dilli police talash rahi thi aath saal baad usee raju kii khabar pate hi police uchhal padati he
 a team immediately leaves for Paras Hospital
 team aspataal pahunchati he
 Two lakh prize and Neetu's killer were still in the hospital
 magar police ke aate-aate uski saanson kii door cat chuki thi
 Now a dead was lying in front of the police
 wo murda jise wo aath saal se dhund rahi thi
 But what happened to Raju Gehlot aath saal tak wo apane ghar tak se dur kaise rahaa
 And the biggest question is that till eight how did he openly win in Gurugram, just ten kilometers from the Delhi Police border
 wo bhi ek badi company main bade ohade par naukari karte hue? Social activist Anna Hazare termed the visit of senior BJP leader LK Advani against corruption as a show-off and said that he would not support the BJP unless it supports the Jan Lokpal Bill in Parliament and its governments are the Lokayuktas in the states Does not make laws for the appointment of majboot lokapal vidheyak kii maang ko lekar pichley maheene 12 dinon tak nai dilli main anshan par baithe hajaare ne congress or samprag sarkaar par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki congress ke bheetar anek log maanate hai ki vah pradhanmantri hai
 He told television channels here that if Advani is serious on the issue of corruption, instead of traveling, he should ask all bjp-ruled states to enact laws for appointment of Lokayukta
 yah dikhaava he
 Hazare said, of course not
 agar bhaajapa kahati he ki vah anna kaa samarthan karti he to use apane rajyon main lokayukta vidheyak laana chahie
 First bring Lokayukta Bill and then ask for support
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne somvaar ko kaha ki shiksha ke adhikaar ko puri tarah lagu karne ke liye centre sarkaar ko shat-pratishat raashi uplabdh karaani chahie

 The video of the entire incident was captured by a man on his mobile

 Sonu Nigam often makes his place in the headlines through social media

 Shiv Sena has demanded that the word secular should be removed from the preamble of the constitution as India has never been a secular nation but a Hindu nation
 puraa vivaad khadaa hua ek sarkari vigyaapan ke baad jisamen samvidhan kii prastaavna main secular shabd kaa istemaal nahin kiya gaya
 After this, the opposition strongly targeted the government
 ganatantr diwas ke maukey par information and broadcasting ministry ke ek vigyaapan ko lekar vivaad chhid gaya he
 Words like secular and socialist were missing from this advertisement
 shivasena ne centre sarkaarase is vigyaapan ko hataane kii maang kii he
 According to the Shiv Sena, India is a Hindu nation and has never been a secular nation
 shivasena ke varisht netaa sanjay raut ke mutabik, 'bharat secular desh nahin he
 If Pakistan is a Muslim country then India is also a Hindu nation
 'shivasena kii maane to bijepi ne yah galati jaanboojhkar kii he or wo is maamle par bahes karnaa chaahati he
 It would not be wrong to say that Shiv Sena wants to take advantage of the opportunity by giving political color to this issue
 yah kisi se chipa nahin he ki shivasena ne socialist or communist party ke taur par hi mumbai main apane pair pasaare hai
 At the same time, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's political adviser and former BJP leader Sudhindra Kulkarni has also opened a front against the party
 unke mutabik khud atal chaahate the ki desh secular or socialist ho or agar bijepi in shabdon ko hataati he to yah atav bihari vaajapeyi kii baat naa maanane jaisaa hoga
 Kulkarni spoke through Twitter
 Let's condemn this strongly: BJP Govt's Republic Day advertisements omit “secular” and “socialist” from the Preamble to the Constitution
 1— Sudheendra Kulkarni (@sudheenkulkarni) January 28, 2015if BJP Govt wants to remove "secular" & "socialist" from the Preamble, let it dare to introduce a Constitutional amendment to this effect
 2— Sudheendra Kulkarni (@sudheenkulkarni)january 28, 2015"secular" & "socialist" in the Preamble form the Basic Structure of the Constitution
 BJP government CANNOT omit them even if it wants to
 3— Sudheendra Kulkarni (@sudheenkulkarni)january 28, 2015parliament annulled many Emergency-era anti-democratic amendments to Constitution after 1977
 But it retained "secular" and "socialist"
 4— Sudheendra Kulkarni (@sudheenkulkarni)january 28, 2015with RSS leaders talking about making India a 'hindu Rashtra', PM # Modimust reassure nation that he remains committed to "secularism"
 5— Sudheendra Kulkarni (@sudheenkulkarni) January 28, 2015constitution's preambular principle of "socialism" mandates us to build an egalitarian and equitable India
 No government can junk it
 6— Sudheendra Kulkarni (@sudheenkulkarni) January 28, 2015why are BJP supporters so ignorant? Party's own constitution (last amended Sept 2012) says it's committed to "secularism" and "socialism"
 7— Sudheendra Kulkarni (@sudheenkulkarni)january 28, 2015if Secularism & Socialism fill BJP supporters' nostrils with bad odour, let them demand removal of these words from Party's Constitution
 8— Sudheendra Kulkarni (@sudheenkulkarni) January 28, 2015BJP founder-president bharatratna # Vajpayeewanted Secularism & Socialism to be in party's Constitution
 Their removal means disowning ABV 9— Sudheendra Kulkarni (@sudheenkulkarni)january 28, 2015 BJP core committee meeting begins in Mumbai, meeting at CM Fadnavis' residence Patil- We are ready to prove majority The political stir in Maharashtra has intensified after the decision of the Supreme Court

 This meeting is being held at the official residence of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis
 mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ke ghar par yojit baithak main maharashtra prabharee bhupendra yadav, ashish shellar, rawasaheb daanve, girish mahajan samet kai netaa maujuud hai
 a strategy is being chalked out to prove majority in the meeting
 bijepi ko kal shaam 5 baje tak bahumat sabit karnaa he
 BJP state president Chandrakant Patil said that we respect the decision of the Supreme Court and are ready to prove a majority in the floor test
 ensipi netaaon se mili ajitsupreme court ke aaj mangalvaar ke faisle ke baad maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis se milane dipti siem ajit pavaar unke awaas par pahunch gaye
 Earlier, Ajit Pawar held a meeting with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders
 gupt sthaan par hui is baithak menensipi netaaon ne ajit pavarko manaane kii koshish kii
 During this, the leaders demanded Ajit Pawar to resign
 ensipi netaa prafull patel ne kaha ki ajit pavaar hamaari baat samaj rahe hai
 On resignation, Ajit has asked to take a decision soon
 vah thodi der main faisla lenge
 Following the Supreme Court's decision, NCP chief Sharad Pawar welcomed the court's decision in a tweet and said, "I am grateful to SC for upholding democratic values and constitutional principles
" ye kaaphi khushi ki baat he ki maharashtra kaa faisla samvidhan diwas ke din aayaa he
 ' uttar pradesh kemujaffarnagar jile main ek dil dahala dene vaala maamla saamne aayaa he
 a 22-year-old woman was allegedly raped by two youths in front of her mother in a sugarcane field in Kakrauli district of the district
 police ne yah jaankaree di
 The incident took place on Sunday when the girl went to buy medicine with her mother in Kakrauli police station area here
 thana prabharee (esechao) jitendra kumaar ne kaha, dilashaad samet do aropiyon ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya gaya
 He said that the victim has been sent for medical examination
 peedita ke pita dwaara darj karai gai ek shikaayat ke anusaar uski beti ke saath aaropee ne tab balaatkaar kiya jab vah apni maanke saath davaayen kharidne gai thi
 bjp's minority cell has decided that it will release details of the post-independence riots in the country
 cell yah bhi bataaegi ki in dangon ke dauraan kis soobe main kis party kii hukumat thi, inamen kitne alpsankhyak maare gaye or dangon ke doshiyon ko kya sajaa hui
 This entire exercise is meant to answer the Congress strategy to surround Modi on the Gujarat riots after the Godhra incident
 guuruuvaar ko bijepi ke upaadhyaksh or party kii muslim vijan document cameti ke mukhiya mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne kaha ki ham musalamaanon ko bargalane main yakeen rakhte hai
 Naqvi said, 'the party is preparing a plan for the empowerment of Muslims
 iskaa lakshya alpsankhyakon kaa utthan hoga naa ki tushtikaran kii raajnneeti karnaa
 In such a situation, the question came that how can the BJP that Narendra Modi is leading in elections avoid the question of Muslims that Modi has been the villain of Gujarat riots
 is par nakvi ne kaha ki dange pehle bhi hue hai or baad main bhi
 When the discussion on these was spoiled for a long time
 ab bijepi aazaadee ke baad hue har dange kii report or uske gunahagaaron ke naam janata ke saamne laaegi
 Naqvi claims that in the Bhagalpur riots, the Meerut riots and even before that the 84 riots, the Congress was sitting hand in hand
 party modi raaj ke pehle gujarat main hone vaale dangon kaa bhi zikr karegi
 Its purpose is to tell that if the riots after Godhra are eradicated, then the BJP rule has been the most peaceful
 party kii alpsankhyak samiti ke ek or pravaktaa ne kaha ki vah jald hi bijepi ko muslim virdohi party bataane vaale logon kaa pardaafash karenge
 BJP leaders met on Thursday at the house of committee member Shahnawaz Hussain to discuss the draft of the riot document
 is baithak kaa mahatv isliye bhi bad gaya kyonki narendra modi bhi chunavi ranneeti par charchaa ke liye dilli pahunche hue hai
 He first met leaders like Varun Gandhi and Subramanian Swamy at Gujarat Bhavan and then after that he attended a meeting of the party's parliamentary board
 mana ja rahaa he ki party kaa sheersh netritv bhi is baat par jor de rahaa he ki modi ko project kiye jane se hone vaale muslim dhruvikaran ko roka janaa chahie
 In such a situation, there is a possibility that Modi will speak openly about the Gujarat riots and the situation of Muslims in Gujarat with the intention of ending disputes forever
 haalanki isamen ek ashanka yah bhi he ki party kaa vah kor voter, jo modi ko unke kattar hindu image ke chalate pasand karata he, bhramit ho saktaa he

 The central government's recent announcement of the redevelopment of the Rabindranasansad campus and Central Vista shocked environmental professionals from across India
 abhiruchi kii abhivyakti (expressant of interest) ke prakashit dastavej se aisa lagata hota he ki sarkaar ne pariyojna par gambhirtha se vichaar nahin kiya he
 The timeframe set seems to be impossible, the working conditions completely ignore the city and it has been interpreted as just an engineering project, whereas in reality, its implications are far more complex and important for Delhi
 
 yah bharat main shaharikaran prakriya jaise bade muddon par bhi sawaal khadey karata he
 The structure of Delhi is circular and Central Vista is located in the geographical center of the city
 anya mahanagaron, jinke centre main aabaadi kaa ghanatv sabase adhik he, ke vipareet dilli kaa centre haraa-bharaa or khulaa he
 This is a truly unique situation and the green image contributes to the idea of a 'national place' for the people of India
 26 janvari kii parade jaise aayojan us chhavi ko majboot karte hai
 In Delhi itself, thousands of citizens consider it the only green lung where they want to go around with their family members
 dilli main aane vaala koi bhi paryatak bina central vista ko dekhe is shahar se vidaa nahin hona chahta
 It is not just a piece of real estate, but the main identity of the capital of India
 central vista dilli master plan main atyadhik sangrakshit vishesh ilaaka rahaa he or iske vikaas sambandhi dishanirdesh taiyaar karne se pehle vistrut shahari dizin ke adhyayan kii aavashyaktaa he
 The buildings at Parliament House and Raisina Hill are part of a protected area
 central vista cameti, supreme court ke nirdesh par gathit heritage conjarveshan cameti, dilli urban art kamishan or south dilli municipal korporation, ye sabhi central vista ke prahari hai
 This proposal violates existing heritage protection regulations for 'grade-a' buildings
 yah kshetra vyaavhaarik rup se dilli kaa haraa fefda bhi he
 There are thousands of fully grown trees standing in this area and there is no idea what their fate is going to be
 is kshetra ke harith maarg main kendriya sachivalay parisar main ek bhawan se duusare bhawan ke bich pedo ke bich se dur-dur tak raste bane hai
 Its image is drawn from the mixed form of the buildings like the tower, the walkways between the domes
 yahaan tak ki in parisaron kii deevaaren or dwaar apane viraasat charitra se abhinn rup se jude hue hai
 The proposal is intended to convert all these into an unimaginable engineering tender process
 duniya ke kuch sabase prasiddh shahari diginon main se ek samajha jane vaala central vista bhi kya bhadkile gudgaanv yaa noida ke chote bhai jaisaa ban jayega? shahar ke madhya main parking kaa bhaar badhanaa apane aap main sabase badi nasamajhi he
 The most important aspect that we need to reconsider is our stance on the Sustainable Development Goals and the Climate Change Agreement
 ham is baat ko garv ke saath kehete hai ki bharat sanyukt raashtra kii in donon pahalon kaa ek hastaksharkarta rahaa he, lekin nae central vista prastaav main tikaaupan or jalwaayu parivartan ke muddon kii andekhi ho rahi he
 Our international outlook is something else and our work on the ground is something else! Of course, it is plausible that radical changes are being made for administrative reforms
 yah tathy ki aazaadee ke baad se saansadon kii sankhya doguni ho gai he, us vishay par bhi nishchit rup se dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 But cement concrete is considered to be 60–80 years old after which it deteriorates
 kancreet kii imaaraton ke saath agle 150-200 varshon ke liye ek nai viraasat banane kii ichha, ek or kapol kalpana he
 If such a huge and hastily designed project is implemented in the center of Delhi, how big a challenge can it be? Where will the working ministries go when the buildings are being demolished and rebuilt? What about the waste, dust and other toxins resulting from this heavy construction? Where will the water for construction come from? How will the access, security and storage systems of the common people be organized in these ministries? i see a situation like an administrative panic or annihilation; a project manager's nightmare is probably going to turn into reality! Serious professional consultation and vision on climate change and India's overall urban heritage is a must

 Women activists of Bhumata Brigade, led by Trupti Desai, defied the tradition and tried to forcibly enter the temple
 ' According to the editorial, "there may be genuine concerns about the place of women in religious matters, but the arguments of 'rationalist protesters' in support of those who defy tradition are wrong

 While everyone wants their home decorations to be traditional as well as something different, there is also the worry of budgets going awry due to high expenses
 aise main kam kharche main hi rachanaatmak tareekon ko apanaakar ghar kii shobhaa badhaai ja sakati he
 The tradition of making bandanwar and rangoli on Diwali has been going on since ancient times
 aajkal bazaar main bahut prakaar ke bandanvaar uplabdh hai, lekin aap chahen to apane ghar par hi bandanvaar bana sakate hai jo bajet main kam hone ke saath arkshak bhi lagegaa or aap avashya hi tarif ke paatr bhi honge
 In the olden days people used to decorate the doors of their houses with colorful flowers, Ashoka and mango leaves etc
 But in this modern era everyone likes to walk away from the trend, so some new types of bandanwars can be made
 inamen jari border bandanvaar banane ke liye koi bhi vyakti apni pansad ke sies ke bukram ke donon taraf jari border laga saktaa he, phir us par stone or mirar chipka den, ant main moti yaa ghunghru bhi sui dhaage kii sahaayta se lagaai ja sakati he
 Put it on your door, it will give a traditional look along with being a designer
 isi tarah sunaharaa chamkila bandanvaar banane ke liye bukram kii chaudee pattee par fevicol kii madad se sunaharaa rang chipakaaen phir us par tissue kaa riban banaakar dizin taiyaar karen
 Now paste the flower leaves
 phir sui-dhaage main moti or sitare pirokar bandanvaar main jagah-jagah lagaaein
 In this way, attractive bandanwars can be decorated in the house
 iske alaava deepawali par khaas mahatv rakhane vaale deeyon kii jagamagaahat se diwaali kii khubsuurati main chaar chand lag jate hai, par inke saath kuch nae tareeke apanaakar or bhi aakarshak banaaya ja saktaa he
 Bring the candles available in the market with small stand at the bottom, then place them in small and colorful jars of glass available in the house
 yah ek nayaa hi luk degaa
 If you want, you can decorate these jars in a group on a flat mirror
 coffee mag main bahut sari lambii mombatti ko kaaphi maatra main ek saath rakhen or jalaaen, yah bahut hi khubsurat lagata he
 The designer diyas available in the market add to the glow of Diwali even more
 ghar kii saaj-sajaavat ke saath-saath poojasthal kii sajaavat kaa bhi apana hi mahatv he
 Dupattas or silk sarees with wide borders can be used to decorate the area around your place of worship
 inhen jhaalar ke rup main tepe se chipakaaen
 This will definitely give the decor a new look
 rangoli ke bina diwaali kii sajaavat adhuri hi lagati he
 To make the traditional rangoli more attractive, you can use different colored pulses and flower leaves, which will give the rangoli a traditional as well as modern look and the viewer will not be able to live without being praised
 diwaali ke tyohaar main in sabake saath ek mahatvapurn tathy he ki paryaavaran or badhate pradooshan ke prati aap kitne jaagruk hai
 In the pomp of Diwali, we forget how much we are polluting the atmosphere with these firecrackers
 agar aap diwaali paryaavaran ke anukul manaaen to nishchit hi aap roshni ke is tyohaar par sabhi ko ek sandesh denge ki prakruti kii suraksha ham sabhi kaa ferj he

 ’ rahul ne kaha ki kabhi andhrapradesh uttarapradesh se peeche hota tha lekin congress kii aguwai main 15 saal baad andhra pradesh uttarapradesh se aage nikal gaya

 idhar lakhanu main samaajawaadee ghamaasan machaa he, udhar sugabugahat he ki paariwarik kalah se ajiz aae mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ab apni raajnneetik tarakkee nai party ke saath karenge
 The discussion is even that the intruders in the family have left no stone unturned to puncture the cycle, so now Akhilesh will proceed on a political journey with a motorcycle, so that he arrives early

 According to the rules of the Election Commission, if Akhilesh is intent on forming a new party, then he will be registered only by January

 In such a situation, the play of Akhilesh's new party may be spoiled in the absence of time and political quagmire
 akhilesh ke saamne he chunauteeb niyam or sharton kii roshni main dekhen, to november sar par aa gaya he
 As the rar moves forward and continues on a different path, it is evident that his political motorcycle will not run on the trails where Netaji's bicycle has hiked so far
 motorcycle chalaane ke liye road kii jarurat padegi, jisamen kam se kam teen maheene kaa vakt lagegaa
 Obviously how much petrol will be left till then because the bicycle does not require petrol
 ab to akhilesh ko petrol bhi bharaana padegaa
 There are many terms and conditions for the new party
 Former Chief Election Commissioner HS Brahma told Aaj Tak that it takes a maximum of 90 days to complete the registration process of any party
 kai niyam va sharte bhi hai, jinhen party banane ke ek maheene yani 30 dinon ke bheetar puraa karnaa hota he
 The application for registration within thirty days of forming the party should reach the secretary of the commission
 chaahe dak se bhejein yaa khud haathon-haath jamaa karen
 Along with the application, there should be a demand draft of ten thousand rupees as process fee
 party kaa samvidhan jiske har pej par party mahasachiv, adhyaksh yaa phir chairman ke dastakhat jaruri hai
 Not only this, but every member of the executive should be aware of the affidavit
 pehle darje ke magistrate, oth kamishnar yaa phir notary ke saamne shapath patr kaa praaanpatr or bank acount va permanent account number kii tafasil bhi jaruri he
 The number of activists who elect the executive should be at least hundred
 nai party kaa chunaav main behatar pradarshan jarurichunaav ayog ke mutabik sabase pehle raajnneetik dal kaa registration ho, phir ek chunaav main uskaa parformens dekhakar hi rajya stareey party kaa darja milegaa
 That is, Akhilesh will have to wait for the next election to ride a motorcycle because the registered party will have to show Jauhar in the election to become a recognized party
 rajya stareey yaa rashtriya stareey dal kaa darja milane ke baad kisi bhi party kaa raajnneetik safar thodaa saral jarur ho jaataa he
 First, the candidates on his ticket get the right to contest on the same election mark across the state
 namakan kaa parchaa bharte vakt ek prastaavak se bhi kaam chal jaataa he
 First of all, the party gets two sets of voter lists free from the commission
 baaki ke liye party ko tay shulk adaa karnaa hota he
 Also, according to the level of state and country, in the general election, AIR and Doordarshan get a chance to speak once
