 On a bright night of May 2011, the US Navy Seal killed Osama bin Laden in his hideout in Abbottabad city of Pakistan
 is abhiyaan kii ek gopneey jaanch pakistan main hui thi jo al jajira ko haath lagi he
 It said that this campaign is the 'biggest embarrassment' for Pakistan since the 1971 war with India
 uske mutabik, america ne ''pakistan ke bheetar ghuskar ek vidweshpurn sainya abhiyaan” ko anjaam diya tha jiske bare main islamabad ko suchit nahin kiya gaya or pakistani suraksha pratishthan ko is baat kii koi bhanak nahin thi ki bin laden abtabad main yaa phir pakistan main kahin chupa he
 The results of this report, which came after months of investigations by a four-member tribunal headed by a former Supreme Court judge, are surprising and surprising
 isamen kisi ek vyakti ke upar dosha nahin madha gaya he
 The names of the culprits are also not included in this
 bin laden ke parivaar or iesai ke varisht guptchar afasaraan samet do sau se zyada logon se baatcheet ke baad kamishan nishkarsh ke taur par kahata he ki may, 2011 kii vah ghatana akele na to iesai, na fouj or na hi sarkaar kii 'naakaami’ he
 Instead, it refers to the entire society and especially the elite class which is inactive and within which there is also the penetration of extremist jihadis
 bin laden kaa pataa lagane main naakaami kaa dosha sidhe iesai par madha gaya he, jiske bare main sirf yah kaha gaya he ki aisa uski ''aakshamata kii had ko darshata he, jo avishwasaneey nahin to hairatnaak jarur he” jabaki dosha kii adhiktam seemaa dikhaane ke liye uski kaman ke un staron kii ''sangeen mileebhagat” kii baat kahi gai he jisaki pahchaan kamishan nahin kar sakaa he
 The failure to detect the American Intelligence campaign in Abbottabad or to respond to it until the raid campaign is complete has been blamed on the bureaucracy of the security establishment, which the commission says is in need of a large-scale reorganization
 
 sankshep main, yah report apane aap main vinaashkari he yahi vajah he ki iske puraa ho jane ke chah maah baad bhi pakistan ab tak ise aadhikarik taur par jari nahin kar paaya he
 How the expedition topped the list of America's most wanted people, bin Laden had been living with his family in a villa in Abbottabad for six years
 uske saath uski teenon biviyaan, aath bachche or paanch naati-pote bhi the
 Reportedly, he fled from Torabora in Afghanistan in late 2001 and reached Kohat town near Peshawar where he met his family
 uskaa parivaar 9 / 11 ke baad se karachi main chupa hua tha or vahaan se swat ghati gaya
 There bin Laden met with 9 / 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM) at least once
 keesam ko 1 march, 2001 ko siie ne rawalpindi se ek sainya kshetra main pakadaa tha, jo fouj ke mukhyalay se bamushkil ek mile dur tha
 When the CIA raided, they had not told ISI that they were searching for KSM
 is giraftaar ke kaaran laden ko do saal tak haripur jaakar rahanaa padaa
 During that time a special hideout was being arranged for him in Abbottabad
 dhire-dhire uske parivaar ke duusare sadsy bhi usase ja mili
 He arrived in his new destination in August 2005
 abtabad desh kii rajdhani islamabad or rawalpindi ke government communications headquarter se uttar main 30 mile dur he or mashhoor karakoram hive par he
 There is also the Kakul Military Academy of Pakistan, which was less than a mile away from bin Laden's whereabouts
 abtabad kaa naam angrej faujee afasar or aupniveshik prashaasak james abt ke naam par padaa he, jisane 1853 main british sena kii chhavnee ke taur par is shahar kii sthapana kii thi
 Abbott fought on behalf of the British East India Company against the Sikhs in the mid-19th century and was very proud of his city
 siie ne bin laden kaa pataa lagane ke liye uske pakistani sandeshvahak abu ahamed al kuwaiti kaa peechha kiya tha
 Kuwaiti had been an ally of bin Laden in planning the 9 / 11 attack and carried and carried his message to the outside world
 al kuwaiti pakistani pakhtoon kabaili tha
 He was raised in Kuwait
 vah arabi or pashto dhadlle se bolta tha
 In 2010, American detectives discovered that he was in a three-story house in Abbottabad, which looked different from other houses in the city
 yah makaan 18 foot oonchi diwaar se ghira tha, jis par taar kii baad lagi hui thi, jahaan koi phone yaa internet signal nahin tha or aisa lagata tha ki vah kisi ko chupaane ke liye hi banaaya gaya tha
 It was not possible to see from outside due to walls and screens within this complex
 pakistani kamishan ne is makaan ko 'ajeeb dizin’ kaa bataaya he
 No evidence of collusion: Since 2003, the Pakistan Commission has closely examined every aspect of the construction of this house
 uskaa nishkarsh he ki ''farji kaagajon or pahchaan ke aadhaar par gaiyrkanoonee or aniyamit lenden kaa samoochaa silsilaa” tha, jis ore sthaneey prashasan or iesai kii najar jaani chahie thi
 The commission expresses astonishment that it is true that "for six years in a row, the neighborhood, local officers, police, security and intelligence officers have seen its size, strange shape, wire fences, cars or any movement
" The absence of "etc
" is an inability that does not believe
 ’ iesai ke kuch tatwon kii mileebhagat se report inkaar nahin karti lekin kamishan maanata he ki use koi thos saboot nahin mili
 The commission says that al Qaeda had adopted good tactics to hide its leader for six years
 lekin sirf al kuwaiti or uske bhai ke boote bin laden nahin chupa rah saktaa tha
 This would require a larger network
 sil team ko makaan main aise phone number mili, jinase pataa chalata he ki al kuwaiti kaa ek aatanki sanghathan se sampark bana hua tha
 In a June 2011 New York Times report, the organization was named Harkat ul Mujahideen
 bin laden nauven dashak ke ant se usase judaa hua tha
 In the eighth decade, the ISI created him to fight India and it has been working with loyalty for decades
 uskaa netaa fajularrahaman khalil islamabad ke bahari ilaake main khuleam rahata he
 The report does not make a specific opening like the Times report, but concludes that al-kuwaiti and his gang were "well-versed in the Pakistani jihadist community" that facilitated his activities and led to Laden's whereabouts Used to help in hiding
 kamishan sifarish karata he ki pakistan sarkaar is baat kii jaanch 'puure sarokaar’ ke saath kare ki kya us 'maahaul’ main iesai ke log bhi the
 There is no answer to this question
 The report has right emphasis on environment
 pakistan main al kaayda koi hawa main kaam nahin karata balki use ek dostana maahaul miltaa he
 Among bin Laden's allies were lashkar-e-taiba leader Hafiz Saeed and Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar
 donon iesai ke bhi sahyogi hai
 The report gives the correct conclusion that the root of this problem is indeed hidden in the history of this country
 uske mutabik, ''general jiya-ul-haq kaa andhera daur pakistan ke paas aapraadhik, hinsak, vichaardhaaratmak or rashtravirohi sanrachana kii ativaadee viraasat chhod gaya he
 "all the US presidents since Bill Clinton have been warning Pakistan that the consequences of harboring or sustaining terror will be disastrous today, if not today
 ab to vinaash ho chukaa he, balki general jiya ne jo daitya paidaa kiya tha vah roj kisi na kisi ko pakistan main nigal rahaa he
 The commission says that the us-pakistan relationship has been "fluctuating" since its birth in the fourth decade but reached its lowest level in 2011
 report kahati he ki obama prashasan ne shuru se hi iesai or vahaan ke sainya netritv par bharosa nahin kiya
 The commission quotes a paragraph from this author's writings on Pakistan and reiterates my quote as evidence of Obama's lack of confidence in the generals here that Pakistan is "the world's most dangerous country"
 ”donon deshon ke bich rishte haalanki 2011 ke baad se kuch sudhare hai, lekin yah sirf satahi maamla he
 The commission's report warns us that we still do not have the answer to Abbottabad's biggest mystery of how the most wanted man of history has been hiding in the courtyard of the Pakistani army for six years without any inkling? The report puts the basic blame on isi's "massive inefficiency" but does not deny collusion

 The countdown to the Lok Sabha elections has started as soon as 2019 begins
 paanch rajyon main vidhansabha chunaavon ke baad siyaasi dalon ne aam chunaavon kii taiyaariyaan shuru kar di hai
 In the recent elections in Rajasthan, the Congress is back in power, so the party is emboldened
 to vahiin bijepi ke liye raahat bhari khabar yah he ki uske or congress ke bich maton antar itnaa kam rahaa ki aane vaale kuch maheenon main party isaki bharpai kar sakati he
 Rajasthan has 25 Lok Sabha seats
 pichhlaa vidhansabha chunaav baari bahumat se jeet kar ai bijepi ne saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main rajya kii sabhi siton par kabja jamaaya
 But the party had to face defeat in the seats of Alwar and Ajmer in the Lok Sabha elections held in late 2018
 philhal rajya se bijepi ke 23 saansad hai
 Political background Talking about the Lok Sabha constituency, it is the general seat under Bikaner division
 churu ko thar marusthal kaa getwe bhi kaha jaataa he
 Talking about the political history of Churu parliamentary seat, this seat formed in 1977 has been dominated by Jats every time except one election
 bas raajnneetik dal hi badale lekin ummidavaar jat samudaay kaa hi jeeta
 In the total 12 general elections held so far in Churu Lok Sabha seat, BJP was elected 5 times, 4 times Congress, 1 time Janata Party, 1 time BLD, and 1 time JNP (S)
 churu main hue pehle loksabhaa chunaav main bhartiya lokdal ke ummidavaar ke taur par daulat ram saaran purv rajyapal or congress ummidavaar mohammad osman aarif ko haraakar loksabhaa pahunche
 In 1980, Daulat Ram Saran again captured this seat on JNP (S) ticket
 iske baad 1984 main daulat ram saaran congress ke mohar singh rathod se chunaav haar gaye
 This was the first time that any non-jat could win this seat
 baad main mohar singh ke nidhan ke baad hue upachunaav main congress ke narendra budania jite
 In 1989, Daulat Ram Saran returned once again on the Janata Dal ticket
 saal 1991 aate aate daulataraam saaran kaa prabhaav churu main kam hone laga, tab bijepi ne pehali baar yahaan se ramsingh kaswaan ko ummidavaar banaaya
 In this election, Ramsingh Kaswan defeated Mohar Singh Rathore's son and Congress candidate Jaisingh Rathod
 iske baad lagaataar do baar is seat par congress ke narendra budania ne kabja jamaaya
 But in the 1999 Lok Sabha elections, Budania lost the election to bjp's Ram Singh Kaswan
 jiske baad ramsingh lagaataar teen baar churu seat se saansad rahe
 But in the 2014 elections, BJP gave ticket to his son Rahul Kaswan instead of Ram Singh Kaswan
 philhal rahul kaswaan churu se saansad hai
 In this sense, BJP has been in the seat for the last four consecutive times

 Barring the exception of 1984, this seat was always occupied by the Jat fraternity
 agar do jaaton ke bich bhi muqabla rahaa to bhi jaaton ke vot jeetne vaale ummidavaar ke peeche lamaband hua or apane voton ko bantane nahin diya
 While the votes of other castes were divided

 hindi ke namchin lekhakon kaa maananaa he ki desh main sarvaadhik boli jane vaali is bhashaa kii kitabon ke bazaar main kapirite kaa sankat he or lekhakon main is sambandh main jaagrukta kaa abhaav he
 According to Javanpeeth director Ravindra Kalia, there is a lack of consciousness among Hindi writers
 kitabon kaa kapirite hote hue bhi prakaashak kitni pratiyaan chhap rahe hai, is bare main amuman lekhak anjaan hi rahata he
 He stressed that copyright means where there is transparency
 jaise videshi bhashaaon kii kitabon ke prakaashak kapirite ko lekar paardarshita baratate hai
 He said that with the expansion of Internet, the crisis of copyright has increased and the writer and publisher of Hindi is not literate in terms of technology
 bina chetana or jaagrukta ke kapirite mahatvaheen ho jaataa he
 People know about this after the copyright dispute in the movies
 kavi lakshmishankar bajpeyi ne kaha ki kitabon ke kapirite ko lekar lekhakon main jaagrukta kaa abhaav he or hamaare desh main abhi tak lekhan ko kamai kaa jariya nahin banaaya gaya he
 Perhaps neglect is a big reason
 bajpeyi ne kaha ki kuch apwaad ko chhod diya jaye to log vyavsaayik taur par nahin balki shaukia taur par lekhan kaary karte hai
 Due to this, it is misused in the Hindi books market and irresponsible people have made it a means of earning money

 Got an idea from someone and are writing about it
 khaskar manchi kavi taalia batorne ke liye aisa karte hai or logon main padhane kaa rivaaj khatm ho rahaa he
 Describing the lack of awareness among Hindi writers as the reason for this, he said that there is a lack of central magazines in the country, through which people used to know which writer is writing what at the moment
 raajakmal prakaashan ke ashok maheshwari ne bataaya, ‘mujhe aisa nahin lagata ki hindi main kapirite ko lekar kisi prakaar kaa sankat he
 Many books have been published in this regard, which are available in the market at very low prices
 ’ unhone bataaya ki ab to desh main kapirite ko bechnaa kaaphi mushkil ho gaya he
 For this it is necessary to get permission from the court first and it is totally wrong to consider lack of information as a crisis
 unhone kaha ki vyavasthit dhang se prakaashan karne vaale prakaashak kitabon ke naam ko lekar bhi kaaphi sajag rahete hai or unki koshish hoti he ki naam dobaaraa na aaye

 (with input from Neeraj Vasistha) uttar pradesh ke chitrakoot ke paas manikpur main vasco di gamma express durghatnagrast ho gai he
 13 coaches of the train derailed
 chitrakoot dm shivakant ke anusaar haadase main 3 logon kii maut hui he
 It is being said that there were ICF coaches made of old technology in the rail, that is why the coaches climbed one above the other
 agar coach german takanic alechabi(lhb) se bane hote to haadase ke scale ko kam kiya ja saktaa tha
 Train is an important part of our life, but there are many things about the train that the common man must know
 darasal aapane dekha hoga ki train ke coach do tarah ke aane lage he, pehla to nile rang ke coach jinamein aap or ham aamtaur par safar karte he lekin ek coach aapane or dekhen honge jo silver or laal rang ke hote he
 Do you know what is the difference between these two and what is the use of both of them
 train main jo coach nile rang ke hote hai unhenthichh (integral Coach Factory)coach kaha jaataa he
 And those that are silver and red in color are called LHB (linke Hofmann Busch) coaches
 
 
 
 Know what is the difference between ICF and LHB coaches ICF (integral Coach Factory): Integral Coach Factory is located in Chennai, Tamil Nadu
 isaki sthapana 1952 main kii gai thi
 This factory works under the Indian Railways
 intigral coach factory main har tarah ke intigral coach banaae jate he jinamein general, asi, sleeper, demu or memu coach shaamil hai
 Vasco di Gama Express accident, 3 killed, 10 injured, no relief work started
 LHB (linke Hofmann Busch): Link Hoffman Bush (LHB) factory to manufacture coach is in Kapurthala
 bharat main in coach ko germany se laayaa gaya he
 LHB coaches are used in LHB coaches in high speed trains
 These coaches are used in the country's fastest train Gatiman Express, Shatabdi Express and Rajdhani Express
 bataa den, LHB coach ko fast speed train ke liye hi dizin kiya gaya he
 They have the ability to run at speeds of 160 to 180 kmph
 durghatana hone kii kam ashankaeabh coach factory main bhi har tarah ke alechabi coach banaae jate hai jinamein asi, non asi, sleeper coach shaamil he
 The journey of railway passengers in these coaches is very safe and there is less possibility of accidents in them
 ICF coach ke mukaable LHB coach kaaphi behtareen hote he
 Let me tell you, there is a lot of difference between the two coaches
 jaaniye safalataa kaa paracham fahraane vaali in bhartiya mahilaon ke bare menjane LHB or ICF coach ke bare main kuch khaas jaankariyaan, kyon jaruri he train meniabh coach
 
 
 - LHB coaches have an average speed of 160 to 200 km while ICF coaches have a speed of 70 to 140 km per hour
 is speed par ye donon coach surakshit tareeke se daudte hai
 - LHB coach has (anti-telescopic) anti telescopic system due to which its compartments are not easily derailed
 vahiin duusari ore iske dibbe stalenes steel or aluminium ke bane hote he jabaki ICF coach mild steel ke bane hote he jo zyada jatke nahin sah pate or durghatana kaa kaaran ban jate hai
 - The LHB coach has a disc brake system that allows the train to stop quickly while the ICF coach has an airbreak and thread brake system that takes a little longer to stop the moving train
 - LHB coach kaa wheel base ICF coach ke mukaable chota hota he jo hai speed hone par bhi rail ko surakshit rakhata hai isse durghatana hone ke chance kam hote he
 - If you sit in LHB coach, the sound of running of the train will not bother you much because its sound level is 60 decibels while ICF coach's sound label is 100 decibels
 aisi shakhsiyat jisane puraa jivan laga diya maanav seva main- LHB coach main microprocesar se control hota he
 It has an air conditioning system that controls the temperature of the coach
 jisase train surakshit rahati he
 - In LHB coaches, two compartments are coupling differently so that in case of accident, the coaches do not climb one on top
 aamtaur par durghatana main ICF coach ke dibbe ek ke upar ek chadh jate he or jaan-maal kaa zyada nuksaan hota hai

 a post shared by disha patani (paatni) (@dishapatani) on Mar 8, 2018 at 8:44am PST Have you ever thought how often you breathe in the midst of a day's struggle? Even if you breathe 12 times in a minute, then the person maintains his existence every day by taking more than seventeen thousand breaths
 lekin is dauraan ye khyaal shaayad hi aata ho ki ek din aisa bhi hoga jab zindagi tham jaaegi
 Human thinking has always been aware of this fact of life
 sab jaanate hai ki ek din wo nahin honge
 And knowingly or unknowingly, we want to do everything in such a way that even after us our presence remains alive in some or the other
 yaa to yaadon main yaa kuch aise kaamon main jo ham dusron ke liye kar gaye
 The story of 23-year-old Geeta of Pakistan connects the same wire
 maaf kiijie asal main hindustan kii gita
 This girl, who crossed the border by mistake 14 years ago, has now grown up
 wo bol or sun nahin sakati
 But his desire to meet his mother and come to India made his story extremely filmy and heart touching
 uski kahani haal hi main release hui film bajrangi bhaijan se mail bhi khaati he
 In such a situation, he meets Salman Khan through live broadcast of Barkha Dutt on NDTV
 salmaan ke behad secular or khushmizaaj andaaz ke saath gita kii kahani or bhi zyaada acchhee lagane lagati he
 But in this program, when Salman said that it is better for him to stay in Pakistan when Geeta's mother has no idea, then Geeta's tears did not stop
 wo bas roti jaati he, roti jaati he
 To correct the mood of Geeta, Salman also tries hard to make her laugh and finally she smiles
 sach shaayad yahi he ki gita ko paalane vaale pakistani naagarik uske sachche maa-baap hai
 Today, in many respects it does not even matter which country the Gita is
 lekin 14 saal se uski ankhon main apni maa se milane kaa sapana zarur he
 Whether Geeta is able to meet her real family or not, there is a purpose in her life which gives her new energy to live
 salmaan khan bhale hi kaanoon kii nazar main criminal hon, gita ko rote-rote hansaa dete hai bhale hi wo sarhad ke is taraf hon or wo us taraf
 This moment is special for both
 tippaniyan This story tells us so much that life is precious
 gita jo bol or sun nahin sakati, use jivan bhi mila or uskaa ek maqasad bhi
 Salman who has everything, people are angry with him and also throw life
 dukh donon ko mila he, pyaar bhi donon ko mila he
 They both have a life to live
 apane-apane andaaz main ek-duusare se bilkul alag bhi, ek jaisi bhi
 But during this time there is hardly any idea that there will be a day when life will stop
 insaani soch zindagi kii is sachai se hameshaa vaakif rahi he
 Everyone knows that one day they will not be there
 or jane-anjaane ham sab kuch aisa zarur karnaa chaahate hai jisase hamaare baad bhi hamaari maujuudagi kisi naa kisi main zindaa rahe
 Either in memories or in some of the things that we have done for others
 aisa hi taar chhedati he pakistan kii 23 saal kii gita kii kahani
 Sorry, actually Gita of India
 14 saal pehle galati se sarhad paar karne vaali ye bacchee ab badi ho gai he
 She cannot speak and hear
 lekin apni maa se milane or bharat aane kii chahat ne uski kahani ko behad filmi or dil chune vaala bana diya
 Her story also corresponds to the recently released film Bajrangi Bhaijaan
 aise main enditivi par barkhaa dutt ke live broadcast ke zarie uski mulaakaat hoti he salmaan khan se
 With Salman's very secular and delightful style, Geeta's story starts to look even better
 lekin is kaarykram main jab salmaan ne ye kaha ki gita kii maa kaa jab koi ata-pataa nahin he to unke liye pakistan main rahanaa hi behatar he to gita ke aansu nahin thame
 She just weeps, weeps
 gita kaa mood thik karne ke liye salmaan use hansaane kii kaafii koshish bhi karte hai or akhirkaar wo muskura detii he
 The truth is perhaps that the Pakistani citizens who raise Geeta are her true parents
 aaj ye baat kai lihaaz se myne bhi nahin rakhti ki gita kaa desh koun sa he
 But for 14 years he has a dream to meet his mother
 gita apane asal parivaar se mil paae yaa nahin, uski zindagi kaa ek maqasad he jo use jeene main nai urja detaa he
 Salman Khan may be criminal in the eyes of law, laughing and crying to Geeta even if he is on this side of the border and he is on that side
 donon ke liye ye pal khaas he
 The comments ye kahani hamen itnaa zarur bataati he ki zindagi besh keemati he
 The Gita, which cannot speak and hear, got life as well as its purpose
 salmaan jinke paas sabakuch he, log unase naaraaz bhi hai or jaan bhi chhidakte hai
 Both have got sorrow, love has also got both
 donon ke paas ek zindagi he jeene ko
 In their own way, completely different from each other, same
 insaani soch zindagi kii is sachai se hameshaa vaakif rahi he
 Everyone knows that one day they will not be there
 or jane-anjaane ham sab kuch aisa zarur karnaa chaahate hai jisase hamaare baad bhi hamaari maujuudagi kisi naa kisi main zindaa rahe

 Although all these people boarded the Metro, but shouted slogans within the station and the metro train and demanded that Akhilesh Yadav be given the credit for bringing this new line of metro to Noida
 idhar bijepi ne kaha he ki kaarykram upi main hua or metro bhi upi se chali, to kejariwal kaa aakhir upi main kya kaam
 As for taking credit for the matter, the credit for bringing the metro to Delhi goes to Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the then Chief Minister Madan Lal Khuranako and he has already received this credit
 dopaher main piem modi ne metro kaa uddhatan kiya or shaam ko botanical garden se kalkaji tak metro aam logon ke liye khol di gai

 This will prevent suicide incidents and no one will fall on the track in the event of congestion

 ) The Kejriwal government is going to start a new mega health scheme in Delhi from today onwards, under which the patient will be operated in Delhi in the event of waiting for more than 30 days for operation in any government hospital under Delhi government
 Will be made in hospitals, which will be borne by Delhi government
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal aaj is yojana kaa shubharambh karenge
 Not only this, expensive radio therapy tests like MRI CT scan and PT City scan will also be free
 sarkaar ne iske liye dilli ke kai jane-maane nijee aspataalon ko panel main shaamil kiya he
 All the expensive radio tests of patients from more than 30 hospitals and polyclinics under Delhi Government will be given free in private institutions
 jinka kharch dilli sarkaar vahan karegi
 Costly tests like ultrasound PMG radio nuclear scan are also included in this scheme
 is yojana kii sabase khaas baat yah he ki agar kisi marij ke oparation main sarkari aspataalon main 30 din se zyada kii vatting he, to aise main usamarij kaa ilajanijee aspataalon main hoga, jiskaa kharch dilli sarkaar degi
 This facility will be available to patients referred by 24 hospitals under Delhi government
 galblader heart bypass or kidney ke oparation jaise mahange upachaar ke liye dilli sarkaar ne rajdhani ke 48 nijee aspataalon ko panel main shaamil kiya he
 About 12 most serious and expensive operations under this scheme will now be in private hospitals in case of delay in government hospitals
 haalanki is yojana kaa laabh sirf dilli ke rahane vaale marijon ko hi milegaa
 In case of operation and free test referral by government hospitals, they have to show their identity card, which includes Aadhar card, Voter card and driving license, linked to Delhi
 dilli ke sarkarhospataldoctoron or sarjanon ke saath-saath upkarnon kii kami se jujh rahe hai
 In such a situation, the Kejriwal government has come up with a new scheme for the patients not to bear the brunt of it
 haalanki yah yojana nigam chunaav ke pehle hi lagu honi thi, lekin nigam chunaav kii tarikhon kaa elaan hone ke baad dilli main aachaar samhita lagu hone se is yojana main lagbhag 3 maheene kaa vilamb hua he, lekin aaj is yojana ke lagu hone ke baad se dilli kaa rahane vaala koi bhi naagarik bimariyon se jude muft test or muft ilaaj kaa phayda uthaa paaegaa

 Sukhdev Bhagat has also been a bureaucrat
 unhone 2005 main bidio kii naukari chhodkar raajnneeti main kadam rakhaa tha or congress se vidhayak chune gaye the

 Monsoons, heavy rains and storms are the reason for this
 ab turki, nederland or egypt se pyaaj mangane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 On the other hand, BJP leader CP Thakur said that if onion continues to be sold above 100 rupees, then the crisis of the government in this time of elections in the states will get bigger

 When the tsunami of tears came to a standstill after the devastation of the death of the volcano, the raging ground and the waves of the silent sea left behind them stories of ruin that would be heard and heard for years

 The devastation of nature many times silenced countless lives forever

 Every time, nature continued to wreak havoc and humanity was crushed
 kyonki qudarat kii taaqat par insaani qanoonka bas nahin chalata
 Forgive me, but even if nature had come under the purview of human law and it would have been possible for humans to punish nature, it would not have been known how many times they would have been punished

 But now the work of removing the debris and the corpses from this sea is going on

 Do not listen to the bookies, even though the government should kill the innocent by the firing of terrorists, even if the Mumbai Police personnel are killed by the Pakistani terrorists, even if our soldiers are martyred on the road, what do these bookies have to do with it?

 centre sarkaar ne guuruuvaar ko loksabhaa main purajor shabdon main kaha ki usne kabhi bhi satta main aane ke 100 dinon ke bheetar videshon main jamaa kaale dhan ko waapas laane kaa daawa nahin kiya tha balki iskaa taatpary yah tha ki karrwai 100 dinon ke bheetar kii jaaegi
 However, the opposition continued to surround the government by making these 100 days an issue
 is sambandh main vipaksh ke aaropon ko khaarij karte hue sansadeey maamalon ke mantri em venkaiya naidu ne bhaajapa ke loksabhaa chunaav ghoshnaptr kaa ullekh karte hue kaha ki isamen kaale dhan kii samasya se nipatane ke liye ek kaary bal gathit kiye jane kii baat kahi gai he
 Naidu intervened in the discussion on black money in the House and said, "we are not so stupid that we will ask to bring back all the black money within a hundred days
" ' He reacted against the backdrop of the opposition's allegations that BJP leaders had promised to bring back black money within 100 days of coming to power
 vipaksh ne sawaal uthaaya tha ki 100 dinon kaa vaada karne vaali sarkaar ke satta main aae chah maheene biit chuke hai
 Naidu said the bjp's election manifesto said that if voted to power, the government would minimize corruption and set up a task force to find or bring back black money
 kaale dhan ko waapas laane kii prakriya shuru kii jaaegi
 Giving information about the steps taken by the BJP government to tackle the problem of black money, the BJP leader said that wherever 100 days has been spoken, it means that action will be taken within 100 days
 naidu ne daawa kiya ki purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne pehali baar kaale dhan kaa pataa lagane ke liye 100 dinon ke bare main baat kii thi jab unhone july 2009 main sansad main is bare main ek bayaan diya tha
 Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav said that the public trusted the bjp's election campaign to bring back the black money and hence the government should give an assurance in the House that when the black money will be returned
 unhone kaha, 'desh ke yuva sochate hai ki unhen 15 lakh rupee milenge
 You sold them a lie
 sarkaar ko sansad ko yah suchit karnaa hoga ki ve kab paisa waapas laaenge
 ' mulaayam singh ne kaha ki kaala dhan jald se jald waapas laayaa janaa chahie kyonki kalaadhan ke khatadharak apana dhan nikaal rahe hai
 Naidu said that he is saddened to hear opposition slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 unhone vistaar se bataaya ki pichhali samprag sarkaar ke vitt mantri tak ne videshi bainkon ke khate rakhane vaale logon ke naamon kaa khulaasa nahin kiya tha
 Taking a dig at the opposition, he said that the Supreme Court had directed the then UPA government in 2011 to take steps regarding the money deposited abroad but no action was taken
 aarushi talwaar hatya cond main jan bhaawanaaon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue vidhi mantralay ne sibiai se is 14 varshiya ladki kii maut kii jaanch prakriya band karne vaali apni report par phir se vichaar karne ko kaha he
 Law Minister m Veerappa Moily told reporters, 'CBI is an independent and autonomous organization
 ham ise nirdesh nahin de sakate
 In view of public sentiments in the Aarushi murder case, we have called a meeting of CBI officials and asked them to reconsider the 'closure report' submitted to the court in this case
 ’ gauratlab he ki sibiai ne 29 disambar ko ek adaalat ko ek closer report saunpi thi
 The reason behind this was given by the CBI that no evidence is available on the opportunity to continue the investigation
 is tarah se jis hatyakand ne do saal pehle puure desh ko jhakzor kar rakh diya tha, usamen koi nateeja nahin nikal paaya he
 Moily said the CBI failed to adequately investigate the case
 unhone kaha ki vah is baat ko gambhirtha se lenge ki is tarah kii chook kaise ho gai
 Asked about the threat of boycott of the upcoming session of Parliament by the opposition in the event that the demand for a JPC probe into the 2G spectrum scam is not met, Moily said it was 'irresponsible rhetoric'
 moili ne yahaan vishwaraiya college of ejineering main ek kaarykram se itar kaha, ‘‘is maamle kii sibiai jaanch hui he or sansadeey maamalon kii samiti :pieesi: se jaanch jari he
 If they feel that there is a need to conduct a JPC investigation in addition to the case, then they will have to present a solid foundation and discuss it in Parliament
 ’’ vidhi mantri ne kaha, ‘‘bajet satr kaa bahishkaar karne kii dhamkee dene vaale unke ruukh se sirf yahi jaahir hota he ki ve apane kartavyon ke prati kitne laaparvaah hai
 ' japan main phir ek baar orfish (oarfish) pai gai
 After seeing this fish, people once again remembered the Fukushima Earthquake
 is baar do bahut hi durlabh prajati kii orfish japan ke okinawa dweep (okinawa Island) par pai gayi
 These 4-meter-long fishes were trapped in the fishermen's net on the fishing island, but both died before being taken to the Okinawa Churumi Aquarium
 japan times ke mutabik, in machhliyon ke jaal main funsane se machuaaraa pehle kaaphi ghabara gaya
 Among these, the length of one fish was 4 meters and the length of the other was 3
 6 meter thi, jo dweep ke sirf 2
 5 kilometers came into the trap
 bataa den, orfish atlantic, india or paisefic oshian main pai jane vaali durlabh prajati kii machhlee he
 It is believed that their outward appearance of water points to Earthquake
 2011 main aae phukushima bhuncup (fukushima Earthquake) se kuch samay pehle hi darjanon orfish ko samudr ke kinare dekha gaya tha
 In this earthquake, about 20 thousand people lost their lives in Japan
 haalanki, vigyaan main kisi bhi machhlee kaa prakritik aapadaa se koi sambandh nahin paaya gaya he
 Early in the year 2019, orfish were also seen on the sea sides of Japan
 isi vajah se kai log ghabaraae hue hai

 ‘gulabi shahar’ jaipur main makar sakranti par yojit hone vaale patang mahotsav main is baar bareli kii adbhut kaarigari se saji patange parwaaj bharengi
 Hundreds of artisans from Bareilly have migrated to Jaipur due to demonetisation and the ongoing case of cotton manjes at the National Green Agency (NGT) and are staying there to make and sell kites
 yun to har saal yahaan se 10 karod rupee ke lagbhag kaa patang-maanjha jaipur ko supplai hota he
 Some artisans also go there for employment, but this time their number is much more
 kaarigaron ke jaipur pahunchane se jahaan patang-maanjha vakt se vahaan ke vyapaariyon ko mila vahiin unhone apni pasand ke mutabik saamaan bhi banwaaya
 According to kite businessman Suhail Ansari, kite flying goods worth more than Rs 10 crore go to Jaipur every year
 vahaan ke rajasthan or usase baahar ke rajyon ke vyapaariyon ko baari maatra main patangabaaji kaa maal uplabdh karaayaa jaataa he
 About 50 traders here later go there for accounting
 unhone bataaya ki patang mahotsav ke liye vyapaaree har saal november main jaipur jate hai
 This time around 250 artisans have migrated to Jaipur after work stopped due to demonetisation
 iske alaava engiti se sooti maanjhe par bhi roak lagane kii maang sambandhi maamla is abhikaran main lambit hone kii vajah se bhi vyapaaree kam maatra main maanjha bana rahe hai
 The comments maanjha udyog kalyaan samiti ke adhyaksh kamaal ali ne bataaya ki jile main patang-maanjha ke kaam main khaasi kami ai he
 Demonetisation is the major reason for this
 rupee kii killat ke kaaran kai vyapaaree kaam nahin shuru kar paae
 Along with this, traders are also apprehensive about the ongoing case in NGT
 is kaaran utpaadan bahut adhik nahin kiya he
 This has made hundreds of artisans here useless
 unhone bataaya ki makar sakranti par hone vaale patang mahotsav ke chalate jaipur gaye kaarigaron ko bareli ke mukaable doguni mazdooree mil jaati he
 For this reason, a large number of artisans have gone there this time

 ) As such, every year a kite-manjha worth about Rs 10 crore is supplied to Jaipur
 kuch karigar bhi vahaan rojgaar ke liye jate hai, lekin is baar unki sankhya kahin adhik he
 On reaching Jaipur, the artisans got the kite-manjah traders from the time, while they also made the goods according to their choice
 patang ke kaarobaari suhel ansaari ke mutabik har saal 10 karod rupee se adhik kaa patangabaaji kaa saamaan jaipur jaataa he
 There is a huge amount of kite flying merchandise made available to the merchants of Rajasthan and outside states

 Apart from this, the matter related to the demand to ban cotton manj from NGT is pending in this agency, due to which the traders are making manjha in small quantities
 tippaniyan Kamal Ali, chairman of the Manjha Udyog Kalyan Samiti, said that there has been a significant decrease in the work of kite-manjha in the district
 iskaa bada kaaran notebandi he
 Due to shortage of rupees many traders could not start the work
 iske saath hi engiti main chal rahe maamle ko lekar bhi vyapaaree ashankit hai
 Due to this the production has not done much
 isse yahaan ke saikadon karigar bekaar ho gaye hai
 He told that due to the kite festival on Makar Sakranti, the artisans who went to Jaipur get double the wages of Bareilly

 3- Charges in rice export case
 4- sebi ke diarector kii piem ko likhi chitthee main pranab kii kareebi mahila afasar par dabaav daalane kaa aarope

 But shortly after the end of Team Anna's press conference, Pranab Mukherjee sent a letter to Team Anna terming all these allegations as baseless and accused Team Anna of working under a particular agenda

 According to reports, these hackers claim that they took this step after the CEO of Snapchat called India as poor
 variety magazine ne khabar di he ki snapchet kisi bhi prakaar kihekking kaa khandankarti he
 The company also says that the CEO of the company never made such a statement
 company kii taraf se aae bayaan main unhone kaha ki, 'un shabdon ko asantusht purv karmchaaree dwaara likhaa gaya tha
 We are grateful to our Snapchat community in India and around the world

 Apart from this, people also asked to delete the app by tweeting with # uninstallsnapchat
 iske baad ap kii reating par bhi asar padaa tha
 Due to which the app rating fell to One Star
 bayaan kaa asar is kadar padaa ki ab somvaar ko iskeshere bhi 1
 Fell by 5 percent
 darasal ye sab shuru tab hua tha, jab kuch din pehle yues besd magazine ne company ke puraane karmchaaree ke hawaale se bataaya tha ki 2015 main Snapchat ke siio evan spigal ne apane ap ko amiron ke liye bataaya tha or wo bharat or spain jaise garib deshon main iskaa vistaar nahin karnaa chaahate
 When someone is in love, some things are said and some are understood without saying
 aisa hi haal ladakiyon kaa tab hota he jab unke man main bahut kuch chal rahaa hota he lekin wo jaldi ise bayaan nahin kar paati
 Let us know, 10 such secrets which will tell the boys about the mind of girls
 
 
 1
 Listening to her compliments: Girls are in love when they are in love because they love to be ready for their partner
 aise main unhen bahut acha lagata he ki unka boyfriend unke is badlaav kii tarif kare
 2
 kering patarneravaise mana jaataa he ki ladkiyaan akasar paise vaale ladakon kii taraf zyada akshirt hoti hai lekin aisa nahin he
 It has always been seen that most relationships break up because they lack care
 isliye apni partner kii zyada se zyada care or saport karen
 3
 partner ke past ko jaanane kii icchaahar kisi ke life ke kuch raaj hote hai jo vah kisi se share nahin karnaa chahta lekin ladakiyon ke man main hameshaa ye baat hoti he ki vah puri sachai jaan len
 If your partner wants to know something from you, do not hide anything from it
 yah aap donon ke liye acchhee baat he kyonkiscchai or baatcheet dononko ek duusare ke kareeb laane kaa kaam karegaa
 4
 salaah dene se bacheladakiyon ko unke chulabulapan or zyada pyaar karne kii vajah se ladke akasar unki kii samasya sune bina apane sujhaavon ko unpar thopane lagate hai
 Avoid doing this because girls do not like such things at all
 agar vah kisi baat se pareshaan he to unhen salaah dene se pehle unki baat ko acchhee tarah sun len
 5
 khatm na hone den romanceladki milane ke baad aksar ladke unke upar dhyaan dena band kar dete hai or dhire-dhire rishte main romance or pyaar kii kami hone lagati he
 Never do this
 ladakiyon ko rishte main romance banaaen rakhana pasand hota he
 Therefore, it is important that whether your relationship is new or old, keep stirring the romance in it
 6
 It feels good to know the shortcomings
 People love to know about their shortcomings even more than the likes are appreciated
 lekin usne ye sab bahut hi pyaar or samajhadaari se kahana jaruri he
 7
 sex dixyraisa hameshaa se rahaa he ki istopic par ladkiyankhulkar baat karnaa chaahati hai lekin patarnar sunanaa pasand nahin karte
 So try to know their wishes
 ye aapke rishte ko majboot banane kaa kaam karegaa
 8
 manurs ko banaaen rakhenapane akasar dekha hoga ki filmon main ladke ladakiyon ke liye car kaa darwaja kholte hai or kai baar unke liye kursi khinch kar pehle unhen baithne ke liye kehete hai
 Till now you may have seen these things only but this is not the case
 ye baaten atikets kaa hissaa hoti hai or inkaa hameshaa dhyaan rakhen
 9
 aapaki khooshbu kaa ehsasshodhakartaaon kaa maananaa he kimahilaon ko purushon kii bodyki smile bahut acchhee lagati he or isse unhen aaraam kaa anubhav hota he
 So whenever he comes close to you, hug him loudly
 10
 Boys are a bit careless in every happiness and sorrow, so many times they do not understand the matter of girls
 agar aapke saath bhi aisa hota he to aisa karne se bachein
 Whenever your partner needs you, try your best to be with them, eg, take care of them at the time of illness

 kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki congress or hardik ne bijepi ko badnaam karne ke liye jaanboojh kar aisa naatak karavaaya he
 The Congress has targeted the bjp's 'main Bhi Chowkidar' social media campaign
 party pravaktaa pravaktaa randeep singh surajevaala ne press conference kar kaha ki aajkal chaukeedaar kii chori kii deshbhar main charchaa he
 Modi Baba and 40 thieves want to cheat the people of the country again by putting him as a watchman in front of his name
 unhone kaha ki brands flop ho jane ke baad naam badalakar phir se nayaa propaganda karne kii koshish hoti he
 Surjewala alleged that to hide Modi's failures, BJP has had to do new branding again and again
 congress pravaktaa surajeval ne modi sarkaar or bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki saal-saal modiji apane naare badal rahe hai or nae-nae naare die ja rahe hai
 But the truth on the ground is something that the public is understanding well
 vah haar se ghabara or baukhala gaye hai tabhi is baar 'main bhi chaukeedaar' kaa naaraa diya ja rahaa he
 Prime Minister Modi is the watchman of thieves and is creating a new pretense
 unhone garibon se chori karke paisa amiron ko dene kii niti apanaai he
 bjp's slogan was in 2014, good days will come, in 2015 bjp's slogan was Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, 2016 was bjp's slogan, New India was bjp's slogan in 2017, My country is changing
 In 2018, bjp's slogan was clear, right development bjp's slogan in 2019 i am also a watchman: @ rssurjewala — Congress Live (@incindialive) March 19, 2019 disguised as referring to the looterayamayan, Surjewala alleged that since ancient times he was cheating for the purpose of looting and kidnapping
 Area to disguise come changing and currently is also moving by guards ahead of Ali Baba or Modi Baba and 40 thieves group, which nowadays its name
 priyanka gandhi ke bayaan kaa hawala dete hue congress pravaktaa ne kaha ki chaukeedaar to sirf amir log rakh pate hai, kisaan, vanchit, shoshit or madhya varg ke log to chaukeedaar rakhte nahin
 Randeep Surjewala alleged that in 5 years the watchman has stolen the fair price of the farmer
 mahila suraksha main unki hissedari kii chori kii he
 The youths have stolen their jobs, stolen the honor and rights of the underprivileged, and the watchmen have stolen the business of small businessmen
 khud ko bhagwaan maanate hai modipriyanka gandhi ke vidhyavasini devi mandir main darshan ke dauraan modi-modi ke naare lagane ko lekar randeep surajevaala ne kaha ki modiji or unke andhbhakt mandir yaa dharmik sthal main bhi raajnneeti se baj nahin aate
 The reason for this is that Modi is starting to think of himself as bigger than God, he is not understanding religion
 dharm or aasthaa logon ko jodne kaa kaam karti he naa ki todane kaa kaam karti he
 Randeep Singh Surjewala said that it is written in the Ramayana, Ravana came as a monk, Marich came as a deer, he came in disguise
 modi baba or unke chalis chor ke paas dharaatal main dikhaane ke liye kuch nahin hai, isliye twitor par naam badalane kii hode lagi he

 Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Padmavati remains in constant controversy
 badhate virodh ke baad film ke nirmaataaon ne isaki relies taal di he
 At the same time, the All India Kshatriya Mahasabha with Padmavati was held at the Tall Bowl Stadium in Delhi
 deshbhar ke alag-alag rajyon se rajput samaaj ke log yahaan aae hue hai
 Everyone appeared to oppose the film
 is pradarshan main mahilaayein bhi shaamil huin
 Mahendra Singh Tanwar, President of the Executive of All India Kshatriya Mahasabha, says that we have many problems in the film
 sabase pehle to film kaa naam hi sahi nahin he
 Padmavati 
 
 
 What is this? Mother should be named Padmavati
 rani 
 
 
 Adventuress 
 
 
 Goddess
 
 
 
 These names should be
 duusari baat jo gaanaa dikhaaya ja rahaa he ghumar
 
 
 
 
 
 usamen bhi aapatti he
 Rani Padmavati never danced like that
 wo bhi nahin hona chahie
 This is tampering with our history
 ye release nahin hone denge
 Are the makers of Padmavati lying? The censor has returned the film that will cut Deepika's nose, people who say that Galtamahendra Singh Tanwar says that those who say that they will cut Deepika's nose, will cut Bhansali's head, those people are wrong
 rajput samaaj har mahila kii izzat karata he
 No matter what they are
 deepika ek abhinetri hai
 Our fight is not with anyone
 lekin ham chaahate hi nahin ki rani padmavati par koi bhi film bane
 Show them dancing
 vahi kuch logon kaa ye bhi kahana tha ki agar film release hoti he or yadi koi cinemaghar jalte hai to sari zimmedaari centre sarkaar or rajya sarkaar kii hogi
 In this meeting will decide whether the film Padmavati will be released or not? Overall, the Rajput society does not want the film to be released

 In an official statement issued by Viacom 18 Motion Pictures, it said that the film Padmavati, which is going to release on December 1, 2017, has been postponed

 Viacom 18 Motion Pictures, along with Sanjay Leela Bhansali, one of the most talented filmmakers, has created a beautiful cinematic masterpiece, 'padmavati'

 This film is a story that will fill all Indians with pride and demonstrate the skill of telling the story of our country around the world
 ' Lucknow: The creation of any genre is important from the point of view of the story, not because of form
 rajya karmchaaree sahitya santhaan dwaara lakhanu ke epal club main 'navagit kaa bhavishya evam bhavishya kaa navagit' vishay par yojit sangoshtee main yah baat dow hariom ne kahin
 a discussion seminar was organized on this subject in connection with Dr
 Hariom, a renowned ghazalgo, storyteller, poet and president of the State Employees' Sahitya Sansthan
 is dauraan lakhanu ke eldico greens kaa epal club sabhaagaar sthaneey va bahari geetkaaron se khachaakhach bharaa tha
 Famous newcomer Maheshwar Tiwari, Dr
 Indivar, Dr
 Om Nischal, Om Prakash Tiwari and Madhukar Ashtasana participated in this seminar
 yuai se vishesh taur par pahunchi poornima burman kii maujuudagi ullekhneey rahi
 Highlighting the objectives of the symposium, Dr
 Ravi Shankar Pandey, Senior vice-president and well-known Newcomer of the Institute and the conductor of the first session, presented a number of focus points on the future and future of the new song in today's poetry scenario, and the newcomer critic for the seed statement Dr
 Invites Indivar
 dow indivar ne navagit ke udbhav, vikaas evam samasyaon ko saamne rakhte hue navagit ke samaksh maujuuda chunautiyon kii vistaar se charchaa kii
 He underlined the historical role of the founding of the new song after Shambhunath Singh mentioned the new song for the first time, rejecting the talk of new song enforcement from Geetangini
 unhone kaha ki navagit ke maanakon kaa anupaalan kiye jane kii jarurat he taaki desh kaal va paristhiti ke anusaar navagit kii apni praasangikta va sarthakata siddh ho
 Critic of Hindi poetry and song, Dr
 Om Nischal said that the new song is still entangled with the claim of new song enforcement, so no significant work has been done in the field of reviewing the song
 unhone kaha ki kavita ko lekar bhi niraala kaa maanak tha ki mukt chand kaa samarthak uskaa pravaah he isliye geet ko apane chhandik anushaasan, pravaah, lay, yeti or gati kaa dhyaan rakhana hoga
 It is a must that verses have their limits, so the lyricists of the new poem turned to the new poetry
 par vidambnaa yah he ki nai kavita ke aalochak ise kavy parisar kaa ang maanane main hichakate hai jo ki kavita kii shaileyon ko najrandaaj karnaa he
 Dr
 Nischal said that it is the song before the new song is made and yet it is a form of poetry, not out of it, so the criteria of poetics are well applied to it
 navagit kii apni bhashaa, apane kathy va style main aadhunik hona hoga tathaa use apane naad saundarya kii raksha kerani hogi, jisaki baat jane maane kavi va prageetkaar girijakumar maathur kiya karte the
 The song is no different from the action business of life
 usamen vastunishthata aegi tabhi vah sthaniyata, aanchalikta, shilp or bimb kii drushti se samrudh hoga
 He said that in order to reach the public mind to serious poetry, the songs make the new song a bridge, so they should also be kept in poetry courses, so that the society has a taste for verses, rhythms, songs and new songs
 suparichit kathakaar, gajalgo evam rajya karmchaaree sahitya santhaan ke adhyaksh dow hariom ne kaha ki hamen avashya sochna chahie ki ham apane liye bhavishya kaa koun sa maarg chunanaa chahenge
 It also depends on what you would like to give to society
 unhone kaha ki meraa vidhaon se koi purvagrah nahin he, na ham gender yaa jati-dharm ko lekar pakshpaati hai
 We should see that if everything is not good then everything is not bad either
 jaise sadak kharaab he to vah banati bhi he
 Similarly, there is a way of composition process
 hamen geet ghazal yaa kavita likhane ke pehle sochna chahie ki ham ise kyon likh rahe hai
 Even if one does not listen to Ghazal, do not listen to the song, but when Dushyant wrote Ghazals, no one was focused on his form but on what he wrote
 uskaa kathy kitna majboot he? vah gyanatmak samvednaa va samvednaatmak gyaan, jaisaa ki muktibodh ne kaha he, uski drushti se kitna majboot he
 He said that Muktibodh or Tulsi is considered important not because of its poetic forms but because of its narrative
 dow hariom ne kaha ki gaaya janaa hi kavita kii sarthakata nahin he na hi yah ki vah yaad ho jaay tabhi koi acchhee rachana he
 If there is a way to say new things in the old form, then everyone gets attention on it
 srijan kaa ek tarika navagit bhi he to ve bhi nishchay hi kavita kii kasautiyon par kase jaaenge
 The second most important thing is that all genres are important as long as the tone of resistance is present in them
 satr kii adhyakshata karte hue jane maane navageetkaar dow maheshwar tiwari ne kaha ki navagit ke bhavishya kii chintaa karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 As long as there is liveliness and sociality in the poem, the relevance of the poem and the song will remain
 unhone kaha navageetkaaron ko apane adhyayan kaa dayera badhaana chahie
 He said that the new song has come a long way and the stories, crafts and speculations can be identified within it
 mumbai se padhaare navageetkaar om prakaash tiwari ne kaha ki navagit ke bhavishyi ko lekar chintit hone kii jarurat nahin he na isaki jameen khiski he
 The new generation will pave the way for the new song in its own way
 unhone kaha apane prayaason se unhone chhandas kavita ke shodh va adhyayan ke liye rajyapal ram nik ke sahyog se avadh vishwavidhyalay main jagannatha das ratnakar shodhapith kii sthapana karai thi, jiskaa paryaapt upyog kiya janaa chahie
 Newcomer Jai Chakraborty said that the flow that is being created in the newcomers is seen as a relaxation of the standard of verses and he expressed his assurance about the relevance of the new song
 navagit sameekshak madhukar asthana ne kaha ki navagit kii lay kii filmi geeton kii tarah khinchataan nahin hona chahie
 The discipline of the verse must be valid
 charchaa ko aage badhaate hue rajendra verma va nirmal shukla ne bhi apni baaten rakhin
 The new combination of the future of the new song and the future of the new song was done by Dr
 Dineshchandra Awasthi, General Secretary of the State Employees' Sahitya Sanstha and Dr
 Ravi Shankar Pandey, Senior Vice President
 dow hariom ne rajya karmchaariyon kii sarjanaatmak abhiruchiyon ke protsaahan kii disha main santhaan kii uplabdhiyon kaa ullekh kiya tathaa aashaa vyakt kii ki aisi sarjanaatmak goshtiyon bhavishya main bhi kii jaati rahengi
 It is noteworthy that no state has such an institute for creative promotion of government employees that performs programs on this scale and rewards the creationism of government writers

 Read film once upon a time in Mumbai Dobara's film review, in just 10 points zamin adhigrahan or real estate ke mudde par sarkaar ko gherne ke baad ab rahul gandhi ne amethi ke kisaanon kii badahaali kaa sawaal uthaanaa shuru kar diya he
 In the Lok Sabha on Thursday, Rahul Gandhi raised the issue of the closure of the food park in Amethi
 rahul ne daawa kiya ki pradhanmantri ne chunaavon ke dauraan badale kii nahin, badlaav kii raajnneeti karne kaa aashwaasan diya tha
 But the way the food park in Amethi has been closed, it is clear that the Prime Minister is doing politics of change, not change
 is aarope ke baad achaanak raajnneetik taapmaana kuch bad ho gaya
 Rahul Gandhi said that he liked the Prime Minister's point that he wanted to do politics of change, not change, but the circumstances under which the food park in Amethi has been closed is wrong
 rahul ne kaha ki food park band hone kii vajah se amethi ke kisaanon ko unki fasal kii sahi kameet nahin mil paa rahi he
 The government responded to this new episode of Rahul's recent attacks in the Lok Sabha with assurance
 grih mantri rajnath singh ne kaha ki wo rahul gandhi ko khud is maamle se judi jaankaree ikattha kar suchit karenge
 But stepping out of the house, Rahul made it clear that he was not satisfied with this assurance
 enditivi ne jab rahul gandhi se poocha ki wo rajnath singh ke aashwaasan se kitna santusht hai to rahul ne kaha ki sawaal ye he ki sarkaar is project ko sweekaar karti he yaa nahin
 However, Rahul also said that he will wait for the government's answer in the current situation
 amethi par is raajnneetik khinchataan ke bich fanse mulaayam se jab enditivi ne poocha to wo pehle is mudde par kuch bolne se bachane kii koshish karte dikhe
 The comments haalanki baad main kaha kii amethi main unki sarkaar vikaas kar rahi he
 On the other hand, Smriti Irani, who had lost to Rahul in Amethi, surrounded Rahul and asked what he had done for the development of Amethi
 pehle zamin adhigrahan phir real estate or ab amethi ke kisaanon kaa sawaal uthaakar jahaan rahul gandhi ek taraf apni khoyi hui raajnneetik zamin hasil karne kii koshish kar rahe hai vahiin duusari taraf inhen muddon ke sahare sarkaar ko katghare main khadaa karne kii koshish bhi kar rahe hai
 Now it has to be seen how successful they are in this new political exercise
 guuruuvaar ko loksabhaa main rahul gandhi ne amethi main food park ko band karne kaa mudda uthaaya
 Rahul claimed that the Prime Minister had assured to do politics of change, not change during elections
 lekin jis tarah se amethi main food park ko band kiya gaya he usase saaf he ki pradhanmantri badlaav kii nahin, badale kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 The political temperature suddenly rose after the allegations
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki unhen pradhanmantri kii baat bahut acchhee lagi thi ki wo badale kii nahin, badlaav kii raajnneeti karnaa chaahate hai, lekin jin paristhitiyon main amethi main food park band kiya gaya he wo galat he
 Rahul said that due to the closure of the food park, the farmers of Amethi are not getting the right amount of their crop
 loksabhaa main rahul ke tazaa hamalon kii is nai kadi kaa jawaab sarkaar ne aashwaasan se diya
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that he will gather information related to this matter to Rahul Gandhi himself
 lekin sadan se baahar nikalate hue rahul ne saafe kar diya ki is aashwaasan se wo santusht nahin hai
 When NDTV asked Rahul Gandhi how satisfied he was with Rajnath Singh's assurance, Rahul said that the question is whether the government accepts this project or not
 haalanki rahul ne ye bhi kaha ki wo maujuuda paristhiti main sarkaar ke jawaab kaa intazaar karenge
 When NDTV asked Mulayam, caught in the middle of this political tussle over Amethi, he first seemed to be trying to avoid speaking anything on the issue
 tippaniyan However, he later said that his government is developing in Amethi
 udhar amethi main rahul se chunaav haar chukin smriti irani ne rahul ko gheraa or poocha ki unhone amethi ke vikaas ke liye kya kiya he
 Raising the question of land acquisition first, real estate and now the farmers of Amethi, where Rahul Gandhi is trying to regain his lost political land on the one hand, on the other hand he is also trying to put the government in the dock with the help of these issues
 
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki apni is nai raajnneetik kavayad main wo kitna safal ho pate hai

 UPA President Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday raised the Modi government in the Lok Sabha questioning the privatization of the railway coach factory of her constituency Rae Bareli
 sonia gandhi ke sawaalon kaa jawaab rail mantri piyush goyal ne buudhvaar ko loksabhaa main diya
 Piyush Goyal said that the dual character of Congress has come to the fore about the privatization of public sector units
 railmantri piyush goyal ne kaha ki 2014 tak raibareli ke rail coach factory main kisi tarah kaa koi kaam nahin hua tha, mahaj coach factory kaa nirmaan or paintig kaa hi kaam ho sakaa tha
 Coach production started there last year, today about 1400 rail coaches have been built in that factory
 isse sthaneey logon ko kaaphi rojgaar mila he
 Also, Goyal said that it is Congress, which tried to privatize delhi-mumbai airports
 2004 se nijeekaran kiye ja rahe hai
 His policy in the 2004-05 budget of the Congress-led UPA government was
 bataa den ki sonia gandhi ne loksabhaa main saarvajanik kshetra kii ikaiyon kaa nijeekaran kiye jane kaa mudda uthaate hue modi sarkaar par kuch udyogpatiyon ko phayda pahunchane kaa aarope lagaate hue hamale kiye the
 With this, he mentioned the rail coach factory of his parliamentary constituency
 sonia gandhi ne kaha tha 'raibareli kii saarvajanik sampattiyon kii sarkaar puri raksha kare
 The Rail Coach Factory of Rae Bareli is one of the most modern factories in the country and the previous governments worked hard to take it forward
 sthaneey logon ke rojgaar ke liye bhi yah rail factory mahatvapurn he
 i have to say with sadness that the government is trying to privatize this factory

 Referring to the last match against New Zealand, Kohli said, "in the last match, the bowler showed me the eye and i did the same
 maine kuch nahin kaha
 i have realized that you have to register your presence, but it is not always necessary to do this through words
 aap apane balle se aisa kar sakate hai

 a new feature has come in Google's Gmail, due to which you will start receiving emails from people who you do not know and you have not given them your email address
 mail praivesi kii vakaalat karne waalon ne is par chintaa jataai he
 Google has recently announced this change
 isse jimail yuj karne waalon ke paas ab contacts kii list badi ho jaaegi
 The reason for this is that they will not only have a list of their contacts, but will also have people who are in the Google + social network
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki koi bhi na keval apane ko balki aparichiton ko bhi sidhe email bhej saktaa he
 Google + started two and a half years ago and now has 54 crore users
 jab bhi koi vyakti jimail kaa khaataa kholta he to use google+ swatah mil jaataa he
 With this, his scope is increasing
 google kaa kahana he ki nae feechar se un logon ko bahut phayda hoga jo apane mitron se samvaad karne ke liye donon sevaaon kaa istemaal karte hai
 Google has also said that those who do not want to match strangers can do so by changing the settings
 aisi haalat main unhen sirf unheen logon ke mail milenge jinhen ve jaanate hai
 But the advocates of privacy are saying that Google should make such a system that only the person who accepts the mail should receive the mail
 iske liye ek opt in feechar bhi hona chahie
 Many critics have described it as a cause for trouble

 The two countries have given this information in a joint statement
 aapako bataa den ki washington main do dinon tak chali baatcheet ke baad donon desh is masaude par sahamat hue
 On behalf of India, Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale and Under Secretary of the US Department of State for Arms Control and International Security participated in the talks
 donon deshon ke sanyukt bayaan main kaha gaya he, ''ham dwipaksheeya suraksha or asainya parmaanu sahyog ko majboot karne ke saath-saath bharat main 6 americaparmanu urja sanyantr(nuclear Plant) ke nirmaan ke liye patibaddh hai''
 The statement, however, did not give further details about nuclear power plants
 gauratlab he ki donald trump kii aguwai main america duniya ke tisare sabase bade tel khariddaar bharat main tamaam sambhaavnaaen dekh rahaa he or isi kadi main vah bharat ko or urja utpaada bechnaa chahta he

 haalanki niyam-kaayadon kii vajah se abhi tak baat patari par nahin aa saki thi
 Relieving the ruling BJP, which is facing the threat of instability in Karnataka, state Governor Hansraj Bhardwaj said on Saturday that the Jagdish Shettar government had a majority despite announcing the resignation of 13 party mlas
 haalanki bharadwaj ne kaha ki agar unhen laga ki rajya sarkaar alpamat main pahunch gai he to use sadan main shakti pareekshan se guzarana hoga
 He told reporters in the presence of Shettar after the Republic Day celebrations that the day the government reached a minority even if there is one MLA, i will issue notice
 abhi 13 vidhayakon ne istipha diya he lekin sarkaar phir bhi bahumat main he
 Bhardwaj said that as long as Shettar is the chief minister, he will act on his advice but will not do so if his government loses majority
 unhone kaha, ‘main koi bhi asanvaidhanik kaam nahin karuunga
 I'm watching ’ Today again a heartbreak and a loving relationship comes to an end
 mujhe kuch samaj nahin aa rahaa tha ki kya hua? kaise 8 saal kaa pyaar bas kuch baton or jhagadon ke saath khatm ho saktaa he? kaise koi aapako duniya kaa sabase bada dard dekar ja saktaa he jisane kabhi aapke labon ko bevajaah hansane kaa sabab diya ho?kya aap bhi kabhi aise dard or chintaa se gujarey hai yaa phir apane kisi khaas ke dil tuutane kii pidaa ko samajha he
 There are many such incidents around us where we do not understand why a loving relationship broke up and it all ended
 kai baar vajahen hoti hai lekin itani badi bhi nahin hoti ki jindagi kaa itnaa bada faisla le liya jaae
 Many times, it is impossible to understand why all this happened, but something happens that breaks the relationship inside
 aaie jaane, aisi hi kuch baaten jo ho sakati hai rishte main dhokhaa deni kii vajah
 
 
 1
 atmasamman kii kamikai baar dekha gaya he ki pyaar main ham sab itnaa kho jate hai ki khud ke sammaan ko taak par rakhkar partner kii har baat ko maanane lagate hai
 Love asks for dedication, but it has been seen many times that the person in front of this thing starts taking advantage and somewhere else it causes to cheat
 2
 When the partner ceases to respect you, when the relationship starts, it is bound to take care of each other's small and big things
 lekin jab rishta tuutane lagata he to inhen baton kii kami hone lagati he
 When your partner starts taking your things and things Granted, then understand that now the honor and love in the relationship has started to end
 3
 The fear of losing a partner is often seen in the beginning of a new relationship, a strange kind of fear about the partner remains in the heart, but the same fear can also be seen in long-lasting relationships
 ye dar hota he kamitment kaa kai baar log isi dar ke chalate bhi dhokhaa dete hai
 If your partner is avoiding giving you any kind of commitment then it should be understood that the relationship is on the verge of breaking up soon
 4
 Somewhere he has not bored you, the freshness and love in the relationship is felt in the initial days, after a few years, the same thing starts to be lacking
 vaise zyaadaatar log is kami ko dur karne ke liye bahut saare funda apanaate hai lekin aajkal log apane partner ko hi badalane lage hai or agar aapkaa partner bhi har rogerishte ko boringbata rahaa ho to samaj lijie ki vah ab is rishte ko aage nahin le janaa chahta
 5
 jimmedaariyon se bhaagane kaa sabase aasaan tarikadhokha tabhi miltaa he jab kahin koi kami rah jaati he
 If you think so, then think about this
 jimmedaariyon se aasaani se bhaagane ke liye bhi log dhokhaa dete hai kyonki isse aasaan tarika or koi nahin hota kisi bhi rishte yaa phir insaan se peechha chhudaane kaa
 If ever you see such a thing in your partner, it is good to be a little cautious
 kai baar log sirf aapkaa istemaal karne or imotional phool banane ke liye bhi jindagi main aate hai
 In such a situation, it is good to keep yourself strong and sensible so that the right person can be made a part of life
 satya par asaty kii vijay ke rup main manaaya jane vaala dashahra kai roopon main samrudhidaayak tyohaar he
 The scriptures mention two events at different times on the day of Shukla Paksha of Ashwin i
e
 the month of Quar, which we know as Mahishasura Mardan and Ravanavadh
 patni sita ko ravan ke changul se bachaane ke liye shriram ne dashanan kaa vadh kiya or is tarah adharm par dharm kii jeet hui
 But do you know that apart from this story, there are other things related to Dussehra, which not many people know
 dashahara se kai reet-rivaaj bhi jude hai, jise pichley kai saal se log maanate aa rahe hai
 According to beliefs, Acharya Bhaskar Ameta of Mangal Bhavan-in says that according to beliefs, as a proof of Ravana's slaughter and Lanka victory, the Sri Ram Sena had brought the ashes of Lanka, due to which the trend of taking the ashes of Ravana's effigy to the house started
 Happened
 iske alaava manyata yah bhi he ki dhanapati kuber ke dwaara banaai gai swarnalanka kii raakh tijoriyon main rakhane se ghar main swayan kuber kaa vaas hota he or ghar main sukh samrudhi bani rahati he
 This is the reason that even today, after burning effigy of Ravana, it is considered auspicious to bring home his remains and this does not allow negative powers to enter the house
 asvinasya site pakshe dashamyan tarakodaye
 s Kalo Vijayo Jeeya sanathan samskruti main dashahra vijay or atyant shubhta kaa pratik he, buraai par achchhai or satya par asaty kii vijay kaa parv, isiilie is parv ko vijayadashami bhi kaha gaya he
 The Dravidian Brahmins of South India have a tradition of worshiping Ravana's effigy before burning it

 Today, the matter is about such Kalamkars and their truths, whose truth has made some people so restless that they were afraid of it and started targeting the Kalamkars
 pehle upi or ab empi main ek patrkaar ke qatl kii vaardaat isi kaa subut he
 In both these sentences on the matter of 19 days, two journalists got such a punishment for telling the truth, which only makes Rongte stand up after hearing about it
 fark sirf itnaa he ki pichhali baar munh band naa rakhane par ek patrkaar ko zindaa jala diya gaya, to is baar isi gunaah main ek duusare patrkaar ko maut ke ghat utaar kar uski laash hi phoonk daali gai or wo bhi aise ki gharavaalon ko apane is azeez kii pahchaan uski kii-ring or kapadon ke adhjale kapadon ke tukdon se kerani padi
 If both these statements tease Jamhuriyat, telling the reality of the journalists working on their lives, then they also tell how the mafias who are in power have considered the laws of their feet
 tazaa maamla madhya pradesh ke balaghat kaa he
 
 
 Sandeep Kothari, a journalist who used to sleep with mafia and illegal businessmen from his pen in Kantgi, Balaghatshukwar, at 9:30 pm, was returning home on a bike this day
 kothaari ke saath unka ek dost lalit raahangdaale bhi bike par maujuud tha
 But as both of them reached a deserted place at night, a car from behind hit them first and hit the ground and then three people who got down from the car started beating them
 hamalaavaron kaa andaaz kuch aisa tha, jaise wo pehle se hi ghaat laga kar baithe hon
 He beat Kothari's friend Lalit by chance, but took Sandeep Kothari with him
 bas, yahi aakiri vakt tha, jab kisi ne kothaari ko zindaa dekha tha
 After this Kothari's friend Lalit somehow reached the Katangi police station asking for a lift and told the whole thing
 uski shikaayat par police raat ko hi mauka e vaardaat par bhi ai, lekin sitam dekhie ki itnaa sabakuch hone ke baavjood police tab qaatilon kaa koi suraag nahin laga pai
 Lalit did not recognize the attackers, but according to his instructions, on the second day i
e
 Saturday evening, two people named Vishal Tandi and Brajesh Dharwal were arrested
 lekin tab tak bahut der ho chuki thi
 Tandi and Daharwal agreed to take Kothari's life, along with another colleague Rakesh Nriswani, if the police agreed
 donon ne pehle to chalati car main hi galaa dabaa kar kothaari kaa qatl kiya or phir raat ko hi madhya pradesh ke baahar maharashtra ke wardha main ek railway trek ke kinare uski laash ko deazal daal kar aag ke hawaale kar diya
 The police of Madhya Pradesh, who were identified after seeing the corpse, now reached Wardha on Sunday morning to recover the corpse at the spot, but the Wardha police had recovered Kothari's body on Saturday itself
 laash kii haalat dekh kar use pahchaan paanaa bhi naammumkin tha
 But his family somehow identified him by looking at the remaining things
 police ab bhi is maamle ke tisare mulazim nriswani kii talash kar rahi he
 But this incident has exposed the illegal mining of manganese and other black businesses in Balaghat and surrounding areas
 ab kothaari ke ghar ke log jahaan insaaf kii maang kar rahe hai, vahiin ise lekar madhya pradesh main siyasat bhi tej ho gai he
 But the reality is that in the midst of all these noises, murderers managed to silence the voice of true truth for a while
 udhar shahjahanpur ke jaanbaaj patrkaar jagendra ke qatl ke maamle main muaavze kaa elaan bhi ho gaya or insaaf ko bharosa bhi
 But the biggest question which stood at the time of the attack on the journalist, is still standing
 ye sawaal he ki maamle ke aaropee mantri tak kaanoon ke lambey haath akhir kab tak pahunchenge
 Jagendra has not yet been judged
 Hukumat's faces are also strange
 kabhi hukumat par sachai kii awaz dabaane ke liye kisi patrkaar ko zindaa jala dene kaa ilzaam lagata he
 So the same rule sometimes opens its vault to calm the spark of this suppressed voice
 uttar pradesh ke bebaak patrkaar jagendra singh kii maut ko ab pakhwaade bhar kaa vakt guzar chukaa he, lekin sitam dekhie ki gaharesadame main duube jagendra ke gharawalonko ab bhi insaaf ke liye dharna dena padataa he, dar-dar kii thokar khaani padati he
 It is another matter that the sarcasm that has come out of the ears of the government deafened by the sniffers, finally manages to arouse hope, and the news of relief for the family of Jagendra comes late
 -pichley kai dinon se dharne par baithe jagendra ke gharavaalon se somvaar ko uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne mulaaqaat kii or unhone jahaan jagendra ke parivaar ko 30 lakh rupye kaa muawza or unke donon beton ko naukari dene kaa elaan kiya, vahiin ye bhi kaha ki agar patrkaar ko zindaa jalaane ke is maamle main soobe ke pichhadaa varg kalyaan mantri ramamurti singh verma kasuurvaar paae gaye, to unke khilaaf bhi kadi karrwai hogi
 According to reports, journalist Jagendra Singh, who hails from Shahjahanpur, entered his house on June 1 and burnt him alive
 iske baad wo saat dinon tak maut se ladate rahe or is dauraan unhone naa sirf apane qaatilon kaa naam liya, balki puri saazish kaa khulaasa bhi kiya
 Even now, Khakikanoon's hand did not reach Khadi, but the accused reached Khaki, but Khadi still managed to escape
 jagendra singh ke gharavaalon kii maane to unki hatya uttar pradesh ke pichhada varg kalyaan mantri ramamurti singh verma ke ishaare par hi kii gai he
 Since Jagendra had been writing against Minister Ramamurthy Singh Verma on his Facebook page for a long time
 verma unase naaraaz chal rahe the or unke ishaare par hi pulisavaalon ne is vaardaat ko anjaam diya
 However, this is not the end of this disturbing story
 gharavaalon kii maane to kuch log unhen munh kholane par ab isse bhi zyaada bure anjaam kii dhamkee de rahe hai or police bhi mantri ji bachaane main lagi he
 But the process of persecution with journalists continues even further
 abhi jagendra ke qatl ke maamle ko pakhwaade bhar kaa vakt hi guzara he ki shahjahanpur main hi phir ek baar patrkaar ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 It is alleged that some drunk policemen beat up journalist Prem Shankar, while some bodyguards of Jammu Kashmir government minister Ghulam Nabi Lone also assaulted a journalist

 Now in Bihar, if there is a need to register a case against the head of the village, sub-mukhiya or members of the panchayat, then the government will have to take its permission first

 unhone bataaya ki mukhiya sangh kii maang or purv mukhyamantri nitish kumaar dwaara kiye gaye vaade ke mutabik sarkaar ne panchayat pratinidhiyon ko suraksha kavach dene kaa nirnay liya he
 According to a senior Panchayati Raj department official, "panchayat representatives will also come under the law in the same manner as other public servants if they act against misconduct or rules
 nirvaachit mukhiya yaa upmukhiya ko aaropon ke aadhaar par bina sarkaar kii manjuuri ke pad se hataaya nahin ja saktaa he
 " mantri ne kaha ki panchayat pratinidhi lagaataar maamuli chook ke maamalon main bhi mukademe main fansaa dene kii shikaayat karte rahete the
 In view of this, the government has implemented new guidelines
 nae disha nirdeshon ke mutabik shikaayatein sambandhit prakhand vikaas padaadhikari, anumandal padaadhikari, jila panchayat raaj padaadhikari, upavikas ayukta yaa jiladhikari se kii ja sakati he, lekin maamle kii jaanch anumandal padaadhikari yaa isse upar ke hi adhikari kar sakate hai
 The investigation will be completed within 90 days
 sangyeya aparaadh, gaban or bhrashtachar ke maamle main haalanki praathmiki darj karne or anusandhan karne ke liye police ko chhot hogi, lekin aarope patr daakhil karne ke purv panchayat raaj vibhaag se anumati lenaa anivaary hoga

 When asked by the Chief Minister of Bihar and JDU National President Nitish Kumar on the political developments in Maharashtra, journalists asked if they meant us
 He was questioned about imposing President's rule in Maharashtra
 patna main jawahar laal nehru kii pratimaa par maalyarpan karne ke baad nitish ne maharashtra main raashtrapati shashan lagaaye jane par kaha ki jab koi sarkaar nahin bana rahaa to kya karen? phir unhone kaha ki jo teen partiyaan hai, un teenon ko tay karnaa he ham logon ko isse kya matlab? lekin nitish kumaar yah bayaan dete hue apane chehre par muskaan nahin chupa paae
 It is clear from Nitish Kumar's statement that JDU has nothing to do with Maharashtra politics, but he has no feeling of not having a BJP government in Maharashtra
 iskaa udhaaharan jadyu ke rashtriya mahasachiv kasee tyaagi ne tab diya tha jab unhone maang kii thi ki bhaajapa ko ab samanvay samiti banani chahie, jisase sahyogiyon ke saath behatar talmail ho sake

 aarope he ki yah jameen dhananjay munde ne apane pad kaa durupyog karte hue kaaphi kam daam par sahakaari shakkar kaarkaane ke liye kharidi thi
 Actually, this land was arable but in the documents it was declared as non-cultivable land and nominal prices were levied
 yahi nahin, maamle kii jaankaree saamne aane ke baad bhi jaanch adhikariyon ne karrwai nahin kii

 vah cricket se jitna bhi dur rahaa ho (ek maheene kaa brake) ham net par samay bitaa rahe hai or vah kaaphi gendon ko hit kar rahaa he
 He is batting well

 'he said,' He must have assessed the wickets we have to play on, the pace of the wickets and the shots you are going to play during the Test match
 mujhe nishchit taur par yakeen he ki in do pariyon se ballebaajon ne siikhaa hoga
 Bangar also hoped that the lower order batsmen would do well in the series

 Have been
 lalu ke shabdon kii phuljhadiyon ne chunavi bayaanbaji kii bahaar shuru kar di he
 Lalu Prasad, the leader of the RJD LJP alliance, is taunting and taking pranks at opposition leaders, a match that reminds him of his 15-year-old reign
 bihar ke netritv kii bagdor 1990 se lekar 2005 tak unke dal ke haathon main rahi
 In an attempt to reach out to Muslims after the court verdict on the Ayodhya dispute, Lalu is opening his cards in a kind of grim manner
 lalu kii chutkiyon kii ek baangi buudhvaar ko dekhne ko mili
 The RJD supremo warned the minorities to vote for the Congress, saying, 'congress is more dangerous than the Sangh Parivar
 ’congress kii tulana lalu ne adis egypty machhar se kii jo bina signal diye aata he or kaatane ke baad dengue kii jaanaleva beemaari utpann karata he
 While giving an adjective of Anopheles mosquito to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Lalu said that he bites while buzzing
 uske kaatane se hone vaale malaria kaa ilaaj sambhav he
 Similarly, when Chief Minister Nitish Kumar taunted Lalu on the lines of the famous song 'jai Ho', the RJD supremo gave Kumar the title of misrule
 lalu ne swarchit aath panktiyon kii vyangy kavita se nitish par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 The main points of attack he had made on the suffering of the people in the disaster of flood and drought and said that this time the Chief Minister's farewell is fixed
 lalu ne nitish ke saath sarkaar main 1990 ke apane dinon ko yaad karte hue daawa kiya ki chaara ghotaale ke maamalon kii aanch se peechha chhudaane ke liye unhone apni raahen juda kar lee or aresas kaa daaman tham liya
 Lalu gave the slogan 'rabri no spark'
 apni patni ko do vidhansabha kshetron raghopur or sonpur se utaarne kii ghoshnaa karne vaale lalu ne to up mukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi tak ko chunauti de daali ki unhen apni lokapriyata kii kasuti ko parakhnaa he to purv mukhyamantri ke khilaaf muqabla karne kii himmat dikhaaye
 Lalu alleged, "if Nitish gets a chance, he will not miss the opportunity to become Chief Minister even on the moon
 bina satta ke unhen neend nahin aati
 Modi also retorted, saying that Rabri Devi's entry into the electoral arena reminds us of the jungle raj and chaos that took place during the long tenure of both
 lalu ke ‘rabari nahin chingaari’ naare se khaar khaaye jadyu pravaktaa shivanand tiwari ne kaha, ‘ham lalu ke bayaan se puri tarah sahamat hai ki rabari nari nahin chingaari hai
 He has only done the work of setting fire and ruin in Bihar
 ’congress par lalu ke naveenatam chutkiyon main shumaar he, ‘matlab nikal gaya to pahachaanate nahin, aise khiskate hai jaise jaanate nahin
 After the NDA government at the center, the RJD supremo called for the Congress to help form the UPA government in 2004, saying that after taking support for its own purpose, the Congress has been forgetting its habit
 chunaav prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan lalu ne kaha, ‘logon ne congress kaa asli cheharaa pahchaan liya he, jo bhaajapa ko bihar main madad karne ke liye chunaavon main khadi he
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar responded to Lalu's eight-line poem with 'munadi' so that the RJD supremo's speech could somehow be stopped
 prasiddh sahityakar or ‘munaadi’ rachayita dharmaveer bharti se prerana lekar kumaar ne rajd supremeo kaa karaara jawaab dene kii koshishe kii
 After the attack on Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan on November 4, 1974, Bharti wrote 'munadi' targeting the Congress
 kumaar kii munaadi kii baangi kuch is prakaar he, ‘khalak khuda kaa, mulk badshaah kaa, hukum shahar kotwaal kaa, har khasoam ko aagaah kiya jaataa he ki maharaja kayapalat padhaar rahe hai, apane apane gharon se baahar nikalakar, apni paanch saal kii puri kamai karindon ko saunp do varna sood kii dar bad jaayegi
 In this way, people were warned in Munadi that they would have to hand over the earnings made during the five years after the formation of RJD LJP government
 nahin to sood bad jaayegi
 Indicating in a way on presenting Lalu's son as a strong learner of politics, Nitish said, 'the difference between me and others is in front of the public
 ’ mukhyamantri ne kaha, ‘main jahaan bihar ke vikaas main bharosa rakhata hum vahiin anya log khud ke kutumb ke kalyaan main lage hai
 ' grih mantralay ne ganatantr diwas ke maddenjar suraksha agenciyon ke hawaale se kai rajyon kii police ke liye chetavanee jari kii he
 The Ministry of Home Affairs has issued a security alert and warned the police about possible attacks from drones and air
 raashtrapati bhawan kii suraksha ko lekar khaastaur par aagaah kiya gaya he
 The Ministry of Home Affairs has alerted the Chiefs and Chief Secretaries of Police of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh by writing letters in this regard
 police ko jari kii gai chetavanee main kaha gaya he ki 26 janvari ko ganatantr diwas ke avasar par drone or hawaii artical se khatra ho saktaa he

 com / j4zdccm0df Many such films were made in Bollywood from time to time, in which many 'bold scenes' were shot
 inamen se kai filmon ne bejod va kalatmak filmakan kii vajah se darshakon kii tarifen batorin
 Many films were criticized by intellectuals due to semi-depiction
 par bollywood ne is tarah kii aapattiyon ko yah kahkar khaarij kar diya ki yah seen to 'kahani kii demand' he
 Many times this argument seemed close to the truth, and sometimes wrong
 aksar aisa paaya jaataa he ki film ko hit karaane ke liye sexi drishy daale jate hai or isi ko dhyaan main rakhkar patakatha bhi taiyaar kii jaati he
 By the way, there is a 'central Board of Film Certification', which is colloquially called 'censor Board', for control of film scenes in India
 'sensor board' kai baar to film ke aapattijanak drishyon ko bhi dikhaane kii ijaajat de detaa he, to kai baar sirf patakatha ke aadhaar par hi film ko 'e' certificate de detaa he
 In such a situation, the board comes into the headlines unintentionally
 'sensor board' bharat main filmon, tivi dharawahikon, tivi vigyapanon or vibhinn drishy saamagree kii samiksha karne vaala nikaay he
 It is under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
 ise uparokt varnit sabhi ko vibhinn shrenee pradaan karne kaa or sweekaar yaa asweekaar karne kaa adhikaar he
 Central Film Certification Board category system: Central Film Certification Board has 4 categories for films: 'A' (unrestricted) or 'U': Such films can be seen by people of all age groups
 'a / va' yaa 'U / A' :is shrenee kii filmon ke kuch drishyon me hinsa, ashleel bhashaa yaa yon sambandhit saamagree ho sakati he
 Movies in this category can only be seen by a person older than 12 years in the presence of a parent
 'va' (vayask) yaa 'A' :is shrenee kii filmein sirf vayask, yani 18 saal yaa usase adhik umr vaale vyakti dekhne ke paatr hai
 'V' (special) or 'S': This is the special category

 broad gej par metro chalaane par vichaar kiya janaa chahie, kyonki yah shaharon or iske satellite shaharon ke bich yatra ko kifayati banaata he
 For example, people can live in Meerut or Panipat and easily go to Delhi for work every day, so it is a benefit for the city as well as the commuters
 'gadakari ne kaha ki vartmaan main metro rail nirmaan kii laagat lagbhag 320 karod rupee prati kimi he, jabaki broad gej metro kii laagat kareeb 3 karod rupee prati kimi he

 Two women from the novel
 ek assi kii taraf badhati maa, duusari beti
 The widowed mother came back from her life like a bundle
 parivaar use har chand manaane kii, jindagi main laane kii koshish main
 The mother sunk into the wall adjacent to the bed
 bade bete ke ghar main
 No one can see the invisible change within him
 jeene kii nai umang
 Tomb
 duusari disha se sarsaraahat uthi or retili hawaaon se bhare chumban ke lahariye khatkhatane lage
 The sound of the opening of the sand mausoleum rose high with flutter, as if someone had pampered and raised it with love
 jaise koi purana ped ho jo uthaa or puchkaarkar bolaa, mujhe hi amrit kaa vardaan he, main hi apni boond se kaaya gadhata hum, main kya kuch hum
 The above has given both of us, men and women alike the same superpower in a bond
 sanyukt parivaar jo khatm hote hue bhi khatm nahin hue, unki nok par footte hai ret samadhi se kisse or kathan jaise jharne
 The sand mausoleum is shaken, the waterfalls and their offspring are shaking
 koi gore, koi kaale, koi mote, koi patale, anek kismein, anek hi rang-rup, simaaon kii jaldharaayein, donon taraf bahati hui, or registan kii tarah faili ret kii anek samaadhiyon main khadi ho gai maa, nai puraani duniya main ankhen punah kholti, awaajen sunati, saikadon mile dur se, sarhad paar jahaan koi shaks soya padaa he, ekadam kareeb se, utho bete tumhen daftar pahunchane main der ho rahi he
 There is something in the mother and daughter that maintains closeness between the two
 donon ek duusare ke bina adhure hai
 In the daughter's house, the mother is the daughter of the daughter and the son calls the son, come visit the mother anytime, the mother is old, do not take so long to meet, how many days have you seen and Ari Muniya Bahuriya, your house is like this i forgot my mother
 maa kii chudibhan bolti hai
 The daughter raises her head from the head to kiss the mother, then smiles and rests the head back on the pillow
 wo maa he
 Intra royalty of mother and daughter
 khilti deh or khufia ichchhaaon ke lubhaavne daraavne raaj
 The weather changed and the mother entered the hospital
 ooncha shor or aasapaas ghoomte badan ke rahasyon ko sufiyon kii najar dekhe ki drav he, nilambar he, hawa he, sher he, gau mrug bhi hoga
 Worship the land, look at this world

 When it is found, it is handed over by flames

 Mother walks, blows sand, out of the border, across the border

 Here and there too donon taraf badhati
 Beyond the outskirts

 *** Indian-origin Canadian actress Sunny Leone has said before the release of her second Hindi film Jackpot that she no longer works in porn films
 sani ke mutabik tivi rielity sho big bos main hissaa lene ke baad se unhone adlt film industry ko alavida kah diya he
 Sunny said that she always wanted to be a film heroine and feels lucky that she got this opportunity
 padhie sani kaa ye exclusive intervyndalt star se bollywood heroin, kaisaa rahaa ye safar?ye bilkul 360 degree vaala badlaav he
 i always wanted to be a mainstream heroine
 sach kahuun to ek adlt film star ke liye is tarah ke menstream cinema main aana lagbhag naammumkin hi hota he
 But i was lucky that i was accepted in Bollywood and among the audience
 kitna mushkil rahaa bollywood main jagah bananaa?mujhe lagata he ki big bos kii vajah se meri raah aasaan ho gai
 Every night at 10 o'clock through TV, people sat in their drawing room and saw the real Sunny Leone
 main kisi or saamaanya ladki kii tarah khaanaa banaati, ghar saaf karti najar ai logon ko
 This created a new image in his mind
 agar main sidhe bollywood filmon main kaam karne aati, to shaayad kabhi sweekaar na kii jaati
 Do you still work in porn films? No, people have a big misconception that i still work in porn films
 big bos main aane ke baad hi maine ye kaam band kar diya tha
 Obviously, i cannot remove my past or whatever is on the Internet
 maine porn filmon main acting se hatane kii shuruyaat 2008 main hi kar di thi
 That year i formed a production company with my husband, who made adult films
 yah meraa tarika tha heroin kaa kaam chhodkar produsar banane kii taraf badhane kaa
 How was the feeling of working in adult movie for the first time? See, you have to understand that it is like a business, a professional work
 ye ek aisi industry he, jisamen arabon dollar lage hai or kabhi bhi mandi kii chapet main nahin aa sakati
 So in my mind, while doing adult film, it was to do as much business as possible so that the producer who signed me would not be shocked by his expectations
 maine pehali baar jab porn film main kaam kiya, to isamen meraa partner meraa boyfriend tha
 After that i worked in such films with very few people
 jo pehali film main meraa partner tha or boyfriend bhi, ab vahi meraa pati he
 How did your family react to the decision to join the porn industry? Obviously, like any other normal family, they were shocked by this decision
 jab maine apane pita ko bataaya to vah gussa hue ki itnaa bada faisla lene ke pehle unase charchaa kyon nahin kii
 Then he gave me an advice that i always keep in my mind
 vah bole ki jo bhi karo, kaamyaab jarur hona
 How is Sunny Leone as a wife and sister? i am just like a normal wife at home
 main or mere pati saath main kichen main kaam karte hai
 Let's watch the film
 ek bahan ke taur par main apane bhai ke liye bahut rakshaatmak hum
 i am older and i no longer have parents
 meri koshish rahati he ki use kisi cheez kii kami na mahasoos ho
 What do you think is good and bad in men? i am attracted to intelligent men a lot
 agar kisi ne bahut zyada dio yaa parafum laga rakhaa he, to meraa mood ukhd jaataa he
 Your favorite Bollywood movie, Aashiqui 2

 The Left parties targeted Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for calling the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the 2G spectrum scam as unwarranted
 2 ji spectrum ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye jepisi gathit karne ke sarkaar ke faisle kaa swaagat karte hue makapa netaa seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ne ‘is baat ko lagbhag nyyochit tehraaya he ki jepisi kii jarurat nahin he or vipaksh kii maang isliye maani gayi taaki sansad chal sake
 'he said,' If this intelligence had been shown earlier, we could have saved the winter session (in which the work was not done due to protests over the demand for JPC investigation)
 ’ bhakpa ke rashtriya sachiv di raja ne kaha ki vipaksh ko kosne kii bajaay pradhanmantri ko aatm aalochana kaa rukh apnaanaa chahie

 ’yechuri ne kaha ki vamadal jepisi kii maang kar rahe the taaki is baat kii jaanch ho ki itnaa bada ghotaalaa hone dene main kis tarah puri vyavastha se chhedchhad kii gayi
 The CPI (M) leader said that on the one hand Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal said that if there was no loss to the state exchequer, the Prime Minister compared it to the subsidy being given to the poor on food grains
 unhone kaha, ‘singh ne lagbhag yahi kaha ki jis tareeke se spectrum aavantit kiya gaya vah darasal corporate gharaanon ko di gayi sabsidi kii tarah tha
 Yechury said that it actually shows the condition of the government which is directionless
 sarkari khajaane ko hue nuksaan kaa akalan 3-ji spectrum kii daron par na karne ke rukh par kaayam yechuri ne kaha ki ise un keemton ke aadhaar par kiya janaa chahie jo ‘swaan’ or ‘unitech’ ko 2 ji spectrum license milane ke baad mili
 He said, 'the stakes in these two companies were sold at a price six times the price at which they were allotted licenses by the government

 notebandi kaa uddeshy arthvyavastha main nakadi par nirbharta kam karnaa, digitalykaran karnaa, kar dayera badhanaa or kaale dhan se nipatna tha
