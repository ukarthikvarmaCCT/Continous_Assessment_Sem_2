 Chief Justice (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi on Sunday vigorously defended the current exercise of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam and said earlier it was estimated that the number of illegal migrants in the state would lead to "fear, panic and violence" And the vicious cycle of chaos was strengthened
 unhone kaha ki yah bhavishya ke liye ek aadhaar dastavej hoga
 Justice Gogoi is the chairman of the bench of the Supreme Court which is overseeing the NRC process in Assam
 unhone un tippaneekaron par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa jinhen jamini hakeekat kii jaankaree nahin he
 He said that such people are not only away from the ground reality, but also present a distorted picture which has affected the agenda of Assam and its development
 assam ke rahane vaale sijeai ne kaha ki enarasi kaa vichaar koi nayaa nahin he, kyonki 1951 main hi iskaa zikr kiya gaya tha or maujuuda kavayad 1951 kii enarasi ko adhyatan karne kaa ek prayaas he
 Addressing a function organized on the release of senior journalist Mrinal Talukdar's book "post Colonial Assam (1947-2019)", Justice Gogoi said, "NRC is not without controversies
 main is maukey par spasht kar duun
 NRC is not a new or unique idea
 iskaa zikr 1951 main or khaskar 1985 main hua jab assam samjhaute par hastakshar kiya gaya
 In fact, the current NRC is an attempt to update the 1951 NRC
 '' unhone afsos jataayaa ki kuch media sansthaanon kii laaparvaah or gaiyr jimmedaarana reporting ne sthiti ko or kharaab kar diya
 He praised the citizens of Assam for wholeheartedly accepting various deadlines for the preparation of NRC
 assam main adhyatan kii gayi antim enarasi 31 agast ko jari kii gayi thi jisamen 19 lakh se adhik aavedakon ke naamon ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya tha
 The CJI said, “it needs to be stated and brought on record that those who have raised objections, including these cut-off dates, are playing with fire
 is nirnaayak kshan main hamen yah dhyaan main rakhane kii jarurat he ki hamaare rashtriya samvaad main ‘jamini hakikaton se anjaan tippaneekaron (armcheir camentataron)' ke udbhav ko dekha gaya he, jo na keval jamini vaastaviktaaon se dur hai, balki behad vikrut tasviir pesh karnaa chaahate hai
 "he said that the emergence of social media and its tools have fueled the intent of such 'ground realists' unaware commentators," who thrive through their dual language
 '' unhone kaha, "ve loktantric kaamkaaj or loktantric sansthaanon ke khilaaf niraadhaar or durbhaavna se prerit abhiyaan chalaate hai
 Try to hurt them and reverse their due process
 ye tippaneekar or unke ghrunit iraade un sthitiyon main acchhee tarah se bache rahete hai jahaan tathy nagarikon se kaaphi dur rahete hai or afvaah tantra faltaa-phulataa he
 Assam and its development agenda have been victims of such 'commentators unaware of ground realities'
 ''nyaayamurti gogoi ne kaha ki logon ko ‘‘har jagah galtiyaan or kamiyaan dhundne'' kii ichha tathaa ‘‘sansthaanon ko nicha dikhaane'' kii ichha ko rokna chahie
 Regarding the NRC exercise, he said, "this is an opportunity to put things in proper perspective
" enarasi philhal ke liye koi dastavej nahin he
 19 lakh or 40 lakh does not matter
 yah bhavishya ke liye ek aadhaar dastavej he
 This is a document that may be cited for future claims
 yah meri samaj main enarasi kaa swaabhaavik mulya he
 He said that the work of the institutions is mainly evaluated by the media and especially social media

 yah hamaare parivaar ke liye shandaar weekend tha
 ❤️A post shared byshahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) onapr 20, 2018 at 8:25 am PDT Shahid also expressed happiness over the praise his filmmaker Ishaan Khattar received for filmmaker Majid Majidi's film Beyond the Clouds
 unhone kaha, ishan ne shandaar pradarshan kiya he
 He is getting a lot of love
 vah taaliyon or prashansa ke yogya he
 He is a very talented boy
 ' The new issue of the prestigious literary magazine Lamahi (april-september Samyuktanka) is a rare gift for every reader who is interested in stories
 durlabh isliye ki hindi kahani ke vikaas or badlaav ke dastavejikaran kii jo shramsadhy koshish ‘lamahi’ or uske sampadak vijay raay ne kii he, vah sabake vash kii baat nahin he
 He has been engaged for the last 2 years in trying to evaluate the stories of important storytellers from seventy-seven generations till now
 kam sansaadhan main itnaa bada kaam karne ke liye vaaki ve badhai ke paatr hai
 This attempt to catch the pulse of the Hindi story has been given by the magazine the exact name - Hamara Katha Samay
 yah pehla khand he
 a total of 3 sections are planned
 pehla khand mahila kathakaron par kendrit he
 Mamta Kalia, Suryabala, Mridula Garg, Sudha Arora, Nasira Sharma, Maitreyi Pushpa, Namita Singh, Usha Kiran Khan, Madhu Kankaria, Sushma Munindra, Geetashree, Alka Saravagi, Lavalin, Manisha Kulshrestha, Jaya Jadwani, Pratyaksha, Akanksha Pare Kashiv The works of 46 women storytellers including Pandey, Pragya, Soni Pandey have been examined in this issue
 darasal yah 46 mahila kathakaron ke bahaane saathottar peedi se ab tak ke stri katha lekhan kii vyapak or gahan padtaal he
 i recognize that the challenges faced by female narrators have been more difficult than those of male narrators, and therefore the possibilities have been equally wide for them from diversity of subject to writing style
 mahila kathakaron ne is sambhaavna ko ganvaaya nahin
 This is the reason why female fiction writing has become bold and strong from generation to generation
 vishmata chahen parivaar main ho yaa samaaj main- mahilaon ne badi hi mukharata ke pratirodh kii awaz apni kahaniyon main uthaaya he
 Pankaj Parashar has cited a statement by Lavalin in his article stree-katha and empirical narrative
 lavalin ne kaha tha, "stri parivaar main, samaaj main, kaaryakshetra main kitne rishte nibhaati he- saas-sasur, devar-jeth, bahu-beti, nanad, buaa aadi kyonki uskaa dil dariyaa he
 She joins everyone with perfection of personality — oddly inferior and compressed
 isliye stri anek maitriyaan nibhaa sakati he
 "lavalin's statement is important for understanding the writing of women storytellers
 aurat jo tamaam rishte purnataa ke saath nibhaati he- vahi use itnaa anubhavsampann or samvedansheel banaata he ki kahani main bhi purnataa ke saath hi uskaa vyaktitv ubhar kar aata he
 The diversity of subjects that she has is due to the close hold of these relationships
 purush kathakaar shaayad yaheen chook jaay
 Therefore, the authenticity with which women narrators can write about women cannot be expected from anyone else
 yah baat bhi ullekhneey he ki is ank main pravasi mahila kathakaron ke lekhan ko bhi rekhaankit kiya gaya he
 There is no doubt that this issue is collectible but sadly even such a good magazine has now reached the verge of closure due to lack of resources
 ham hindi vaale kya sirf lambii lambii baaten hi karte rahenge yaa har maheene kuch patrikaayen kharid kar pathakon tak acha sahitya pahunchane kii koshish kar rahi patrikaon ko bachaayenge
 Vijay Rai wrote in his editorial, “we are constantly running at huge losses
 sthitiyaan behatar karne ke liye ham nirantar sangharsh or praytn kar rahe hai
 But if not successful, we will be able to continue it online only by forcing the print version of Lamhi from October - December 19 issue
 "yah sachmuch bahut dukhad sthiti he
 It is a good thing to have a digital edition of a magazine
 yah bada manch he or patrika kii pahunch puri duniya tak hoti he
 It is necessary to use every new technology to reach the readers, but due to the economic crisis, the print edition of the magazine has to be discontinued, it is obviously sad
 iske liye ham pathak hi doshi hai or agar aisa hua to hamen khud ko maaf nahin karnaa chahie
 There is still time hamen patrikaayen kharid kar padhani shuru kar deni chahie, taaki lamahi jaisi patrikaayen itihaas kaa hissaa na bane

 Ninth class teenagers came out of the room at a school in Delhi laughing outrageously, "sammy sperm?" Hahaha
 ye kitni ajeeb he, asal main kisi ne use sex ke bare main baat karnaa sikhaaya hi nahin

 30% of the emerging brigade of teenagers in the country live in cities
 inkaa janm 1996 main internet ke pehali baar bharat main pravesh ke baad hua
 These are the teenagers of India born in the global world - ambitious and alert, competitive and confident, bigoted and determined
 inke paas vayask mastishk main jhaankne kii spasht soch he- shaadi se pehle sex se maa-baap pareshaan nahin honge, lekin kharaab grad se honge, to virginity kii phikr kise he? sex kaa matlab he masti, dosti or chat, chatter, esemes, twitor yaa fasebuk par bahuprachlit shabdah aloelvi (dher sara pyaar)
 Everybody knows india today pichley 11 saal se desh ke sex sambandh rujhaanon par se paradaa uthaata rahaa he
 India Today group-mdr survey will take you on the unknown path - sex and Indian teenagers in 12th year

 If we look at their lives only in statistics, then parents will have a heart attack: According to our survey this year, three out of every 10 students of class 10th have had sex
 isamen koi hairat nahin ki 46 pratishat kishoron ne skool yaa college main istemaal kiye hue condom dekhe hai
 Of these, 25 percent know a teenager who became pregnant
 jaraa kal or aaj kii tulana karen- 2008 ke india today sex survey main sirf 10 main se ek ne is umr main sex karne kii baat kahi thi

 More than half of the teenagers surveyed have told a boy or girl that they love him and 49 percent have kissed someone in a romantic mood
 sex sukh le chuke lagbhag sabhi kishoron ne bataaya ki unhen prem tha, isliye aisa kiya
 For those who have not had sex, virginity is also not important

 mausam vibhaag ne kuch maheenon pehle jab daawa kiya ki is saal desh main acha monsoon aane vaala he to isse sabase badi raahat arthjagat ko mili kyonki acha monsoon uske liye achche din lekar aane vaala tha
 The Narendra Modi government, sitting in power at the Center, was also happy as it gave hope that after the good monsoon, it will get the best economic data before the general elections in early 2019, through which it will powerfully campaign its campaign in power
 Will succeed in its efforts to remain
 achche monsoon kii ummid se kendra sarkaar ko kisaanon kii aamadani doguna karne kaa apana sankalp or uske jariye kisaanon ke achche din laane kaa formula dikh gaya
 Due to this, the central government decided to increase the MSP of Kharif crops by 50 percent
 haalanki kendra sarkaar ne jis formule kaa elaan kiya vah prabhavi taur par emspi main mahaj ek-tihaai kaa ijapha dikhaa rahi he
 Significantly, the Swaminathan Committee had recommended 50 percent increase in MSP keeping in mind the demand of farmers
 lekin kendra sarkaar ne yah ijapha fasal main laagat or kisaan parivaar kii mehnat ko jodakar kiya jiske chalate kisaanon ko apni paidaavaar par 50 fisadi kii jagah mahaj 12 fisadi se santosh karnaa padegaa
 Obviously, this benefit will also be available when the farmer can sell his crop at the government's procurement center
 ise padhein: acha rahaa is saal monsoon to 2019 main BJP ke liye hogi voton kii barish!baharhaal, is formule ke baad bhi kisaanon ko dhan kii emspi par 200 rupee ke ijaphe (1,550 se 1,750 rupee prati quintal) se kuch ummid bandhi kyonki achche monsoon ke chalate unhen yah ijapha kuch atirikt aamadani dene ja rahaa tha
 It is different that this increase till April 2018 is very less than the price of Rs 1,850 per quintal in the paddy market
 vahiin yadi monsoon kamjor padataa he to jaahir he dhan ke bazaar bhav main ijapha or hoga vahiin kisaanon ko emspi main is 200 rupee kii badhottaree kaa phayda dur kii kaudi ho jayega
 Now the weather has started indicating a turn
 mausam vibhaag ke akalan main karavat dikhaai de rahi he
 The Meteorological Department recently admitted that the rainfall during the month of June in North India and East India has been less than 5 per cent
 mausam vibhaag ab kah rahaa he ki june kii tarah july main abhi tak desh ke in kshetron main monsoon saamaanya se 9 fisadi tak kaa antar darsha rahaa he
 The Meteorological Department fears that the monsoon figures may be dismal in these areas of the country during July as well as in June
 iske chalate 6 july tak kharif fasalon kii buaai main badi giravat darj hui he
 According to the Central Government's own figures, a total of 14 in kharif sowing till this time
 2 fisadi kii giravat darj hui he
 On the other hand, sowing of paddy, the main crop of kharif and considered as the backbone for farmers' income, has so far decreased by 15%
 vahiin anya cash crop jaise tilhan or dalhan kii buaai main bhi 13
 4 percent and 19
 4 fisadi kii kami darj hui he
 There will be few provisions of the law which have received so much criticism from Indian citizens as much as Section 66A
 haalanki iskaa kanoonee makasad internet par farjivade ko rokna tha, jald hi yah spasht ho gaya ki kanoon ke is praavdhaan kaa khulkar durupyog kiya ja saktaa he
 The Lok Sabha passed this amendment bill on December 23, 2012 in just seven minutes without any debate along with six other regulations
 agle hi din rajyasabha ne bhi ise paarit kar diya
 Parliament did not get a chance to debate this in detail
 loktantr main sansad main kisi ho-halle ke bich vidheyakon ko paarit kiya janaa hameshaa aapattijanak hota he
 It is true that the constitution empowers the judiciary to review, but Parliament must always ensure that the laws it makes should not be outside its purview or legal scope
 lekin is maamle main sansad yah sunishchit karne main naakaam rahi
 i tried twice to rectify this mistake — by making a statutory resolution and then by making a personal proposal of the members
 maine soochna praudyogiki (madhyavarti disha-nirdesh) niyamavali ko khaarij karne ke liye sansad ke itihaas main pehla nirastikaran prastaav pesh kiya
 This was debated in Parliament and then Information Technology Minister Kapil Sibal assured the House to make changes after consulting with all stakeholders
 lekin sarkaar aashwaasan ko kaayam nahin rakh pai
 The second occasion came during the discussion of a private proposal of the members in which the government was requested to amend 66A in accordance with Article 19 (2) of the Constitution
 mujhe usamen sibbal kaa hastkshep yaad haih "soshal media main abhivyakti kii aazaadee ke istemaal kii simaaon ko sanvaidhanik rup se nirdhaarit nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki jis samay samvidhan kii sanrachana hui thi, us samay koi soshal media nahin tha, sirf print media tha
 "now the Supreme Court has rightly made it clear that even if the Internet is considered separate from other media and there should be separate laws for it, those laws are also valid restrictions on the freedom of expression provided by Article 19 (2) of the Constitution
 You have to go through the investigation
 jab hamane kanoon main istemaal kiye gaye shabdon kii aspashtataa par chintaaen jaahir kin to sibbal ne kaha tha, "kripaya hamen un shabdon ko paribhaashit karne ke liye mat kahie jinhen paribhaashit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 What can distract you, it is possible not to distract me
 " supreme court ne apane faisle ke para 74 main is daleel kii dhajjiyaan udayi hai, "jis takalif kaa zikr kiya gaya he use dhara 294 main spasht rup se paribhaashit kiya gaya he—yani, use kisi ashleel tippanee yaa harakat kii vajah se hona chahie
 Section-510 should be a problem for a person who is intoxicated and when he / she is brought to a public place or any place where his or her access is unauthorized
 dand samhita main aparaadh kii itani baarik or spasht vyakya dhara-66e main sandehaaspad tareeke se nadaarad he, jo ulate khulaa, apirbhashit or aspasht bhashaa main he
 "by rejecting a legal provision that has full scope of abuse due to vested political interests, the Court has made it clear that no bad law will survive any judicial inquiry and freedom of expression enjoys the highest level of constitutional protection
" abhivyakti kii aazaadee asantosh jataane or virodh karne ke kisi vyakti ke adhikaar ko manyata detii he
 Although the judiciary has made several decisions imposing heavy restrictions on the freedom of protest in the near past, this decision can still be considered a milestone in the direction of considering freedom of protest as an integrated part of freedom of expression

 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP created history in Karnataka
 party ne rajya kii kul 28 loksabhaa siton main se 25 par jeet hasil kii
 The BJP had never before achieved such a huge success in the Lok Sabha elections in this southern state
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko karnataka se 17 siton par hi jeet mili thi
 Let me tell you that as far as the Lok Sabha elections are concerned in Karnataka, till 2009 it was considered to be the dominance of the Congress
 haalanki jis tarah bijepi ne yahaan apana aadhaar badhaayaa he, dakshin main is iklaute rajya main bijepi kaa kila lagaataar majboot hota ja rahaa he
 a few days before the Lok Sabha election results came out on May 23, an India Today - Axis My India survey had predicted that the BJP could win 21 to 25 seats in Karnataka
 survey kaa anumaan nateezon main sateek baitha or bijepi ko 25 seat par jeet hasil hui
 The Congress won 9 seats from the state in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, but this time it had to be satisfied with only one seat
 exis maai india kaa data dikhaata he ki 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main karnataka se bijepi ko 51% or congress-jedies gathbandhan ko 42% vot mili
 Others accounted for 7% of the vote
 lingayat samudaay ko karnataka main bijepi kaa tabhi se vot bank mana jaataa rahaa he jab se congress ne karnataka ke purv siem virendra patil ko saarvajanik taur par sharmasaar kiya tha
 In 1990, Rajiv Gandhi discharged Virendra Patil from the post of Karnataka CM from Bangalore Airport
 lingayat samudaay ko ye nagavar gujara or iskaa nateeja congress ko 1994 vidhansabha chunaav main rajya se satta ganvaa kar bhugatna padaa
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Ligayat community stood firm
 lingayat samudaay ke 69% votaron ne bijepi ke paksh main vot diya
 At the same time, the Congress alliance could get the trust of only 23% of the voters from the Lingayat community
 congress ko ummid thi ki jedies ke saath uskaa gathbandhan vokkalinga samudaay bahul kshetron main voton ke transfar main kargar rahegaa
 The congress-jds alliance got 48% of the votes of the Vokkalinga community
 duusari taraf vokkalinga votaron ke 41% vot bijepi ko bhi gaye
 In this way, BJP also made a significant dent in the votes of Vokkalinga community in this election
 muslim votaron ne karnataka main congress gathbandhan ko jamkar vot die
 86% of Muslim voters trusted the Congress and its allies
 haalanki muslim samudaay se 10% votaron ne bijepi ko bhi vot diya
 As far as obcs, generals and others are concerned, 59% of the voters expressed confidence in the BJP
 agar vibhinn ivorgon ko dekha jaae to 5000 rupe se neeche prati maah kii krayshakti (parachesing power) rakhane vaale varg main se 50% votaron ne bijepi ko vot diya
 43% of the voters from this category voted for the Congress alliance i
e
 7% less than BJP
 jaise jaise ye krayshakti badhati gai vaise hi vaise virgon main bijepi or congress ke bich antar badhata gaya
 bjp's vote share was 60% in the category of purchasing power above Rs 21000, even up to Rs 30,000
 vahiin is varg se congress gathbandhan ko sirf 33% vot hi mili
 When it comes to the level of education, the illiterate class relied more on the Congress and its allies
 is varg se congress gathbandhan ko 52% votaron ne vot diya, vahiin aathvin tak padhe varg se 48% vot congress gathbandhan ko mili
 As the level of education increased in the classes, the vote share for the BJP also increased
 dasvin tak padhe varg main se 52% ne bijepi ko vot diya
 For BJP reaching the level of professional degree, this vote share increased to 58%
 ayuvarg kii baat kii jaae 18-25 ayuvarg main 53% votaron ne bijepi ko vot diya
 52% of voters in the 26-35 age group and 50% in the 36-50 age group voted for the BJP
 haalanki 61 varsh or isse upar ke ayuvarg ke votaron main 49% ne congress gathbandhan ko vot diya
 Axis My India looked at the data of voters' choice in terms of their performance
 bijepi ko privet sector main naukari karne vaale varg se 59% votaron ke vot mili
 At the same time, BJP got 60% of the support of the government employees
 jahaan tak doctor, vakil, ejeeniyar jaise profeshnal varg kii baat kii jaae to inke votaron se lagbhag baraabar congress gathbandhan or bijepi ko vot share mila
 49% of the voters from this category voted for the Congress alliance
 isse sirf 1 fisadi kam yani 48% ne bijepi ko vot diya
 The much-talked-about debt waiver scheme failed to do any good in the Lok Sabha elections for the ruling jds-congress alliance in Karnataka
 kisaanon main bhi 51% votaron ne bijepi ko vot diya
 49% of the agricultural laborers trusted the BJP
 mochi varg main 50% or berozegaron main 46% ne congress gathbandhan ke samarthan main vot diya
 As far as the students are concerned, 59% voted in favor of BJP
 udhar congress gathbandhan ko gruhaniyon main 46% ke vot mili
 45% of the housewives voted for the BJP
 bijepi ko karnataka ke shahari or gramin donon hi kshetron se adhiktar votaron kaa samarthan mila
 BJP got 51–51% of the votes of voters in both urban and rural areas
 duusari taraf congress gathbandhan shahari kshetron main 43% or gramin kshetron main 42% votaron kaa hi samarthan hasil kar sakaa
 Congress was expected to get good support from the rural areas due to the continuous campaign for the rights of the farmers, which could not be completed
 agar ling ke aadhaar par vot share kii baat kii jaae to mahila or purush donon main adhiktar votaron ne bijepi ko vot diya
 Among men, 54% voted for BJP and 40% for Congress alliance
 vahiin mahilaon main 48% ne bijepi or 44% ne congress gathbandhan kaa saath diy

 At a time when people have been overwhelmed by the frightening voices of 'tu, Tu-main, Main' coming from the news channel on TV screen, the story told through Sunayna, a child studying in seventh grade, comes as Nazir
 yadi aap is kahani main ko yun na bhi maane ki ise bataur ankar enditivi ke pramukh pranay roy anjaam de rahe hai to hi iskaa mahatv kam nahin ho jaataa! aap keval yah dekhie ki vah kis dhairya se baaten karke jivan ke tamaam sawaalon ko saamne laa rahe hai, isliye aalochana ke khatre ko samajhate hue bhi main kah rahaa hum ki yah haalia samay kii sabase behtareen tivi report he
 When politics is at its peak in the electoral period and thousands of information are reaching your ears through the medium of communication every day, then it is becoming difficult to decide what is the truth
 aashcharya to yah bhi he ki mahatma gandhi ke madhyam se duniya main sach ko jaanane—samajhane or prayog karne kii sabase badi prayogshaala main gandhi ke jane ke itane kam samay main sach sabase bade khatre main lagata he
 The big difference and the basic difference is that the lie is going beyond the part of human behavior and getting organized and organized and increasing its size day by day, at such a time, only children can be expected that their truth will be more perfect than the rest of the time 
 yakeenan sunayana ke har jawaab main aapako sach sunai detaa he
 The difficult thing is that we do not want to listen to the voices of children, because we have accepted that the policy-makers of this world are big, the children are the beneficiaries of this world, their opinion, their voice of this world
 There is no importance in making it, so every section of the society has almost avoided talking to children
 par aap bacchon ke paas jaaie, unase dosti kiijie, unhen mauka dijie or unki baaten suniye, sunayana kii tarah vah aapako jivan ke tamaam ubad—khabad raaston se waakif karaayenge, jin par aap chalenge to vahaan pahunchenge jahaan se aapako sach samajhane kaa rasta milegaa, kyonki unki duniya sirf swaarth par tiki duniya nahin hai
 They have every issue ranging from village animals to their concerns
 unako pataa he ki shahar kii sabji main zyada masaale padate hai or unhen haldi—mirch se kaam chalaanaa pad rahaa he, iske baavjood vah khaanaa banane kaa hausala rakh rahi hai
 They also know the problem of alcohol and also know why the cylinder of Ujjwala is not being made
 She is also able to feel the arrogance of the children of older people and is also hoping that her retired elder Guruji still attends her school
 kheti or ghar kii arthvyavastha par bhi sunayana kii samaj kya kisi vayask se kam he
 In the midst of these circumstances, he has a dream of becoming a doctor, more than his own career, because people in the village are sick, so to become a doctor, the hospital has to be opened in the village itself, find that after studying the doctor, the doctor will go towards the village Let's not even put our face towards the hospital
 isliye sunayana jab baat karti he to uske vikaas kii, uske sapane ke gaanv kii, uske sapane ke bharat kaa rasta thik vaisaa hi jaataa dikhaai detaa he, jaise ki janaa chahie, alabatta hamaara samaaj aisi kisi bhi aawaaj par tavajjo detaa dikhaai nahin detaa he
 Last year, when we conducted an experiment to get the voices of two and a half thousand children in about ten districts of Madhya Pradesh in a very systematic way, their serious thinking was exposed in almost every subject
 uske baad vidhansabha chunaav ke liye bacchon kii ore se ek ghoshnaa-patr banavaane kii baat ai tab bhi bacchon ne usko keval apane muddon tak simit na rakhkar kheti—kisaani—rojgaar tak kii baat gaharaai se kii
 The talk of children seems to be astonishing how they understand the tragedy of child engagement even when our entire discussion is limited to child marriage, and the country has made rules and laws only by recognizing that
 pranay kii yah report bacchon kii aawaaj sune jane or behtareen dhang se saamne rakhe jane kaa ek rasta dikhaati he

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne ravivaar ko bavana sthit tehsil ground main yojit gaanv mahapanchayat main aam aadmi party ke ummidavaar ramchandra ke liye vot maange
 The stage of mahapanchayat was prepared keeping in mind the Bawana by-election to be held on 23 August
 haalanki bavana gaanv ke kisaanon kii samasyaayein jaanane kii bajaay mahapanchayat ek raajnneetik kaarykram banakar rah gaya, jahaan arvind kejariwal ne bhi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ginane kaa koi mauka nahin choda
 mlas and ministers of Aam Aadmi Party were seen more than farmers on the platform of village mahapanchayat
 gopal raay, kailash gahalot, rajendra gautam ke alaava kareeb 15 vidhayak arvind kejariwal ke saath manch par maujuud rahe
 Amanatullah Khan, the suspended MLA from the AAP who was in controversies, also came on stage and supported the party candidate
 ek taraf bavana gaanv ke netaaon ne samasyaon kii lambii list mukhyamantri ke saamne rakhi to arvind kejariwal ne har vaade ko puraa karne kaa aashwaasan bhi diya
 Kejriwal counted the achievements of the government and said that both the jawans and farmers come from the village and the AAP government in Delhi has done a lot of work for both
 dilli kaa jawan agar kahin bhi shahid hua, to uske parivaar ke liye ek karod rupye muaavje kii vyavastha kii
 Last year, compensation of Rs 20 thousand per acre was given for crop failure
 lekin kisi anya rajya yaa centre sarkaar ne dilli se sikh nahin lee
 Kejriwal said that keeping in mind the politics of the village, Kejriwal also remembered the former cms of Delhi-countryside Chaudhary Brahm Prakash and Sahib Singh Verma
 arvind kejariwal ne kisaanon ko bataaya ki AAP sarkaar ne gaanv kii jameen adhigrahit karne par 3 karod rupye prati acre muaavja dene kaa niyam banaaya tha
 Checks were also distributed to farmers in many villages, including Sirspur, but many decisions of the government were canceled with the direction of the High Court
 ab dilli sarkaar supreme court main lard rahi he
 He said that if Delhi was a full-fledged state, it would have worked in 15 days, but now it takes 15 months
 sarkaar dilli main 2 hajaar basen laane ja rahi hai, inamen se zyaadaatar bas dehaat main lagaai jaaengi
 CM Kejriwal said that mohalla clinics will be built in every village
 jin gaanvon se hitation taar guzar rahi hai, unhen under ground kiya jayega
 The CM also made it clear that the AAP candidate won, only then would development work be done here
 bijepi-congress ke vidhayak ilaake kaa vikaas nahin kara sakate
 State convenor Gopal Rai at the village mahapanchayat said that BJP candidate Ved Prakash has cheated the public
 2 saal main dilli sarkaar ne 207 karod rupye ke vikaas kaary ke liye fund diya, ab tak kuch nahin kiya
 Minister Kailash Gehlot said that he too comes from the countryside and as a minister is working on ending the problems of the countryside
 mantriyon ne kisaanon se apil karte hue kaha ki arvind kejariwal ne gaanvon ko pahchaan di, unka maan rakhana
 At the same time, candidate Ramachandra said that he wants to become a servant, not an MLA

 The meeting said that the time has come when the Government of India and its coalition partners will have to keep in mind the explosive situation in Kashmir and find a way to find solutions through dialogue instead of using force to suppress the people's rightful struggle
 
 hurriyat kii baithak ke baad jari bayaan main kaha gaya he ki bharat sarkaar ke naakaaratmak or adiyal ravaiye main kshetra ko vidhvansak yuddh kii ore dhakelne kii kshamta he, kyonki kashmir kaa maahaul bahutnajuk sthitimein pahunch chukaa he or iske samaadhan ko ab taala nahin ja saktaa
 This organization of separatists said that it is important to resolve the Kashmir issue based on the wishes and aspirations of the people of Kashmir so that the future of the people of the entire sub-continent can be secured
 bayaan main kaha gaya ki sirf baatcheet karne ke liye vaarta karnaa, kashmir mudde ko sulajhane main madadgaar nahin ho saktaa he
 This issue can only be resolved by involving the process of unilateral dialogue between the three sides, India, Pakistan and Kashmiris

 He said that if the opposition parties have any doubt about this, then it is their problem

 jaise wo kah chuke hai ki wo keval sapane dikhaane vaale nahin balki unhen puraa karne vaale netaa hai
 Some of his statements have been considered beneficial for his opponents by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 yah poochne par ki kyon prachaar abhiyaan main sattarudh dal is mudde ko uthaa rahaa he, jis par unhone kaha, "suraksha hamaare liye sarvopari he
 This issue should not be politicized
 bharat main agar kisi ko bhi hamaare javaanon kii shahadat par andeh he, agar koi pakistan kii bhashaa main bolta he to ye sabhi desh ke hiton ke khilaaf jaataa he
 These are issues of national security and everyone should speak in unison

 My statement was manipulated by the media

 i never said that
 " mantri ne kaha, "na to main kisi pad kaa daavedaar hum or na hi main kisi daud main shaamil hum
 It is worth noting that i am confident that we will get a bigger mandate than in 2014 and Modi ji will again become the Prime Minister

 Highly placed sources in the Rajya Sabha Secretariat said on Thursday that after extensive consultations it was finalized keeping in mind all the important aspects, including keeping the newly designed dress designed by the National Institute of Design (NID) separate from the army dress

 At the same time, an official said that it will not be returned to the old form at all, because the marshals themselves demanded a change in it, calling the old dress impractical

 His statement is significant in the backdrop of the allegation made by Vasan and supporters that the party's in-charge in Tamil Nadu Mukul Wasnik did not handle the party's case properly
 party kii tamilnadu ikai main kai netaaon ke bich matbhedon ko lekar karti ne kaha ki sabhi muddon par sahmati banane ke liye prayaas hone chahie jaisaa kerala pradesh congress cameti main hua tha

 Yogi Adityanath is also in the interest of the CM of Uttar Pradesh as well as Gorakhnath Peeth (also called Gorakshpeeth) of Gorakhpur

 The yogi is pursuing the same tradition
 yahi vajah he ki unhone ayodhya ko sanvaarane ke liye sarkari khajaana khol diya he
 Digvijaynath's role in the idol of Ramlala in 1952 has been associated with Adityanath's guru Gorakhnath Peetha Guru Mahant Digvijaynath since its inception in the Ram Mandir movement
 digvijaynath shuru se ugr hindutv kii raajnneeti karte rahe hai
 Mahant Digvijaynath is believed to have played a major role behind placing the idol of Ramlala in the Babri Masjid of Ayodhya on 22 December 1949

 Avaidyanath could not be the face of Hindutva due to atal-advani
avidyanath was associated with Hindu Mahasabha
 unhone 1962 se maniram vidhansabha seat kii numaaindgi kii
 Four times later (in 1970, 1989, 1991 and 1996) he won the Gorakhpur seat of the Lok Sabha and reached Parliament
 lekin atal bihari vaajapeyi or laalkrishna adwani ke netritv main chali hindutv kii raajnneeti kii mukhyadhara main mahant avaidhyanath ko mukhya sthaan hasil nahin hua
 In 1994, Avaidyanath, an important face of Yogi Adityanath Ram Temple, declared Yogi Adityanath as his successor to Gorakhpeeth in 1994
 yogi adityanath shuru se hi ugr hindutv kii raajnneeti par chale
 He worked to take forward the Ram Mandir movement on the lines of Mahant Digvijaynath and Avaidyanath

 He became the youngest MP in 1998
 unhone 'hindu yuva vahini' kaa gathan kiya, jo hindu yuvaaon ko dharmik banane ke liye prerana detii he
 After becoming Yogi Adityanath from Ajay Bisht, he continues to be an important face of the Ram Mandir movement
 ab upi ke siem hai to bhi unke tevar ayodhya ko lekar narm nahin hue
 When Yogi Adityanath arrived in Ayodhya after seizing the throne of power of the country's largest state, he said, 'if anyone comes here with this ancient tradition of Ayodhya, then naturally its association with the tradition of Maryada Purohottam Lord Shri Ram Happens and Jai Shri Ram comes out of his mouth

 It is worth noting that in 2014 the nda's clan with BJP with 283 seats was 383 seats, which is now steadily decreasing
 282 se ghatakar 274 tak pahunchi bijepi kii takathaal hi menupi-bihar upachunavonke parinaam aane ke baad sadan main bhaajapa kii siton kii sankhya 2014 ke 282 se ghatakar ab 274 par pahunch gai he
 The Lok Sabha currently has 536 members, while seven seats are vacant
 is hisaab se sadan main bhaajapa ab bhi akele bahumat main he
 However he has an overwhelming majority with the allies
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad se ab tak loksabhaa ke 19 upachunaav ho chuke hai
 The results of these by-elections have been emphasizing the bjp's clout
 upachunaavon main kai siten bijepi ke haath se nikal chuki hai
 Along with losing seats, the difficulties of BJP are increasing because it is now the parties involved in the NDA are showing their eyes
 shivasena kii ghudki ke baad ab tidipi ne endie se baahar hone kaa faisla kar liya he
 bjp's problem is not going to be reduced here
 tidipi ne sadan main avishvaas prastaav laane vaali he
 YSR has also said to support this proposal of TDP
 teen or upachunaav hai bakiabhi bijepi ko teen or siton par upachunaav kaa saamana karnaa he

 log in abhinetri shilpa shetty shanivaar ko 38 saal kii ho gayi
 On her birthday, husband Raj Kundra apologized to her, who was last questioned about betting in the Indian Premier League (IPL)
 tippaniyan Kundra wrote on microblogging site Twitter, "happy birthday my beautiful wife Shilpa
 main tumse un sabhi betuki sthitiyon ke liye maafee maangata hum, jiskaa saamana tumhen pichley dinon karnaa padaa
 But the truth will be revealed in a few days
 " Kundra also thanked Amitabh Bachchan who congratulated Shilpa on her birthday
 unhone likhaa, "dhanyavad sar

 uske liye hameshaa iskaa khaas mahatv rahaa he
 " kundra ne microbloging site twitor par likhaa he, "janmdin mubarak ho meri khubasurat patni shilpa
 i apologize to you for all the absurd situations you had to face in the past
 lekin sachai kuch hi dinon main saamne aa jaaegi
 " kundra ne shilpa ko janmdin par badhai dene vaale amitabh bachchan ko bhi dhanyavad diya
 He wrote, "thank you sir
 shilpa ke janmdin par aapkaa sandesh use kisi bhi duusare sandesh kii tulana main sabase adhik khushi degaa
 It has always been of special importance to him
 " Kundra also thanked Amitabh Bachchan who congratulated Shilpa on her birthday
 unhone likhaa, "dhanyavad sar
 Your message on Shilpa's birthday will make her happier than any other message
 uske liye hameshaa iskaa khaas mahatv rahaa he
 " bharat band, kuch logon ke liye yah jashn manaane kaa samay ho saktaa he, unhen kaam par nahin janaa hoga, yatra nahin kerani hogi or vah dinabhar apane parivaar ke saath samay bitaa sakate hai
 But this celebration and comfort can be damaging to them
 kyonki desh main ek din kaa banksrthvyavasthaake liye ek bada aarthik nuksaan lekar aata he
 Somehow the loss of this loss is paid for the celebration of that one day
 arthvyavastha ko ek din ke band kaa kya nuksaan ho saktaa he? yah sawaal jitna saral he akalan utana hi kathin he
 Daily production of factories, buying and selling of shares in the stock market, every brick being kept daily in real estate sector, sale of malls to small grocery stores, tourism including work in government to private sector offices, Banking and transportation (rail, air travel, road, etc
) are many areas which are directly affected by the strike or strike
 aise sabhi kshetron main pratidin ke kaamkaaj kaa akalan or uskaa yoga arthvyavastha ko pahunchane vaale kul nuksaan ko darshata he
 But it is not that easy to assess, so to understand this, some aspects of the economy need to be considered so that the loss can be estimated from a day's closure
 gauratlab he ki sitambar 2015 main desh ke trade unionon ne ek din ke band kaa aahvaan kiya tha
 Transport and other services including the country's banking system were badly affected in this one day bandh
 is ek din ke band ke baad chembar of indian industries (siaiai) ne akalan kiya ki desh kii arthvyavastha ko kul 25 hajaar karod rupee kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 Once again in September 2016, the Central Trade Union called for a one-day India bandh
 is ek din ke dauraan deshbhar main transport, manuphaccharing or banking seva buree tarah prabhavit hui or industry chembar asocham ne is ek din ke band se arthvyavastha ko 18 hajaar karod rupee ke nuksaan pahunchane kaa daawa kiya
 Read this: The cheapest petrol and diesel available in this part of the country
in January 2018, Dalit organizations called for a one-day Maharashtra bandh and during the bandh, where the trade consolidation in the state was completely stalled, there was violence Due to this, the property of the state was severely damaged
 is band ke baad rajya main ritel kaarobaar ne 700 karod rupee ke nuksaan kaa daawa kiya to rajya ke hotel or restaraan ne 100 karod rupee se adhik ke nuksaan kaa daawa kiya tha
 Recently during July 2018, there was a strike of truck drivers in the country for 8 days
 in aath dinon ke dauraan arthvyavastha ko lagbhag 50 hajaar karod rupee ke nuksaan kaa akalan kiya gaya
 Due to this strike, from July 20 to July 28, about 90 lakh trucks across the country stood on the roads and this had a direct impact on the functioning of government and private sector as well as food products and factories in the country
 
 lihaaja, mahaj trek kii hadtaal ke chalate arthvyavastha ko pratidin 6 se 7 hajaar karod rupee kaa nuksaan hua
 Read this: Historical relief of crude oil prices has ended, now will knock inflation! Now the question of one day Bharat bandh called by political parties
 is band se arthvyavastha ko pahunchane vaale nuksaan kaa akalan karne ke liye in pakshon ko dekhnaa jaruri he:kendra sarkaar ko rajasav kaa nuksaanamaujuuda vitt varsh ke liye kendra sarkaar ne guds and services tex ke tahat kul 12 lakh karod rupee ke rajasav kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 That is, the central government is expected to earn Rs 1 lakh crore from GST every month
 vahiin pichley vitt varsh ke dauraan kendra sarkaar ko prati maah jiesti se lagbhag 90 hajaar karod rupee ke rajasav kii aamadani hui thi
 In the current financial year, if the central government does not get one day GST revenue, then it will have to bear a loss of about Rs 3,333 crore in its revenue
 gauratlab he ki jiesti kaa rajasav desh main sangathit kshetra kii sabhi aarthik gatividhiyon (utpaadan env sevaaon) kaa parichaayak he or rajasav kaa yah nuksaan kendra sarkaar kii kamai ke saath-saath desh kii arthvyavastha par sidhe taur par pahunchataa he
 At the same time, the government is losing Rs 3,333 crore at the rate of GST (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%) in the country
 lihaaja desh main ek din ke kaarobaar ko thap karne main sangathit kshetra ke vyapaariyon ko hone vaale nuksaan kaa andaja sarkaar ke rajasav se kai guna hota he
 After the damage caused by the Bharat Bandh to the economy from time to time, now a day's strike called by political parties is going to damage the economy, it will be estimated how effective this shutdown was
 mevaat main bijepi ne utaare the do muslim pratyashinunh or ferozepur jhirka seat par utaare the pratyaasheedonon hi siton par mili bijepi ko haraharyana vidhansabha chunaav main bahumat na milane ke baavjood bhartiya janata party sarkaar banane ke liye taiyaar he
 The BJP has won 40 out of the total 90 seats and has stayed away from the majority by 6 seats
 party ne mevaat kshetra kii wo do siten bhi ganvaa di hai, jahaan se muslim pratyaashiyon ko maidan main utaara gaya tha
 That is, bjp's Muslim card has not worked in Mewat
 bijepi ne mevaat kshetra main aane vaali do vidhansabha siton nunh or ferozepur jhirka se muslim pratyaashiyon ko utaara tha
 BJP gave tickets to Zakir Hussain from Nuh and Naseem Ahmed from Ferozepur Jhirka
 ye donon hi netaa ilaake main acchhee pakad rakhte hai, jinhen muslim bahul ilaake se ummidavaar banaakar bijepi ne bada daanv chalaa tha, lekin wo puri tarah fail ho gaya
 Khattar's number game in Haryana The BJP declared support of 5 independents to the BJP and lost elections in both these seats
 nunh se congress pratyaashee aftab ahamed ne jeet darj kii he
 Aftab Ahmed has got 52245 votes, while second-placed bjp's Zakir Hussain received 48196 votes
 bataa den ki jakir hossain 2014 main isi seat se congress ke tikat par chunakar aae the, lekin maujuuda chunaav se pehle wo bijepi main shaamil ho gaye the or usee ke tikat chunaav ladaa or haar gaye
 Ferozepur Jhirka seat also did not win BJP
 ferozepur se bijepi ke tikat par chunaav lade naseem ahamed ko kul 47521 vot mili hai, jabaki congress ke vijay pratyaashee mamman khan ke paksh main 84494 vot pade
 That is, where BJP candidate Zakir Hussain fought very closely in Nuh, bjp's Nasim Ahmed failed completely in front of Congress candidate in Ferozepur Jhirka
 bataa den ki naseem ahamed bhi jakir hossain kii tarah haal hi main congress se bijepi main aae the
 Earlier in 2014, Nasim won from Ferozepur seat on INLD ticket
 yani jo netaa congress or inelo ke tikat par mevaat kii in siton par apana paracham laharaate rahe hai, bijepi ke paale main aate hi unka asar feekaa pad gaya or kareeb 70 muslim aabaadi vaale mevaat main bijepi kaa pintara fail ho gaya

 If women who smoke get rid of this habit before the age of 30, then they can get 97 percent freedom from health hazards
 yah khulaasa britain main ek adhyayan se hua he
 This study by researchers at Oxford University also showed that if women quit the habit before the age of 40, 90 percent of their health hazards could decrease
 is shodh main 13 lakh mahilaon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya
 The newspaper 'the Independent' said in its report on Saturday that women who do not quit smoking even in middle age can be at least 10 years old
 adhyayan se pataa chalaa he ki jo log 40 varsh kii umr ke baad bhi dhumrapaan jari rakhte hai, unamem is umr main dhumrapaan tyaag dene waalon kii tulana main swasthya jokhim 10 guna bad jaataa he
 The board of ICICI, the country's second-largest bank with total deposit assets of more than Rs 11 lakh crore, finally sent MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar on leave, succumbing to pressure from market regulator Sebi and investors
 chanda kochar ke khilaaf yah kadam apane liye kathith phaaydon kii evaj main karj dene or bhugtan karne tathaa bank ke saath unke nijee hiton ke takaraav kii aantarik jaanch ke chalate uthaaya gaya he
 On June 18, the board appointed Sandeep Bakshi as the bank's chief operating officer for five years, heading the bank's insurance company ICICI Prudential
 haalanki beete teen maheenon se zyada samay se kochar ko pad se hataane kii maang ho rahi thi, par march main board ne unke khilaaf aaropon ko khaarij karte hue clin chit de di thi
 The trouble began when the media brought up the issues raised by Arvind Gupta, the shareholder of both Videocon and ICICI Bank
 gupta ne 2016 main pradhanmantri or sebi ko likhaa tha or aarope lagaaya tha ki yah bank main ''ehsaan ke badale ehsaan'' kaa saaf maamla he
 He had alleged that Chanda Kochhar's husband Deepak Kochhar had taken advantage of his relationships with his wife
 deepak vaikalpik urja kii apni start-ap company nupower main niveshak ke taur par videocone samooh ke chairman venugopal dhoot ko le aae the
 Six months after the Central Investigation Agency (CBI) gave loans to Dhoot, a loan of Rs 64 crore, forming separate companies, and Videocon's share of Rs 3,250 crore loan from ICICI Bank, all the shares came from Dhoot
 Deepak is investigating to have Kochhar finally transferred
 iske saath hi deepak ke bhai rajeev kochar ke kaarobaari saude bhi jaanch ke daayre main hai
 Rajiv's company Avista Advisory Group used to advise customers of ICICI Bank, which is clearly considered to be a case of conflict of interest
 sebi ne may main isiisiaai bank or chanda kochar ko pratibhuti kanoon ke tahat khulaase kii sharton ke kathith ulanghan ke liye kaaran bataao notice diya tha
 The circumstances that led Kochhar to collapse have been as dramatic as his steps in the corporate world
 56 varshiya kochar isiisiaai bank ke saath 1984 main management train ke taur par judi thim, jab yah industrial credit and investment corporation of india hua karata tha
 He took over as MD and CEO of the bank in 2009, rising up the ladder of progress

 He is credited with making the bank a sector giant, having a vast network of more than 4,800 branches and more than 14,000 atms across the country and operating in 17 countries
 31 march, 2018 ko khatm hue saal main bank ne tex chukaane ke baad 6,777 karod rupye kaa munafa kamaaya tha
 Experts feel that a lot should have been done to address investor concerns
 shairdharakon kii proxi company ingvern ke sansthaapak or emdi shriram subramanyam kehete hai, ''niveshkon ko phikr is baat kii he ki isiisiaai bank ke board ne paryaapt or jaldi karrwai nahin kii
 Even a tremendous demand to change the entire board could arise
 jaanch ab teji se puri honi chahie
 Sources say that Kochhar's tenure comes to an end in March 2019 and it is possible that he will not be signed with a new contract and the new MD and CEO, possibly Bakshi, will take over the reins
 subramanyam kehete hai ki isiisiaai bank ke puraane diggaj bakshi (ve bank ke saath 1986 main jude the) bank main apane anubhav or jaankaree kii vajah se acha chunaav honge
 What is more surprising then is that on June 18, when the first reports came that the board had asked Kochhar to go on leave and hand over the command, the bank's shares rose four per cent on the BSE
 congress netaa ne kaha ki lekin is baar gujarat main unhen congress party ke apane chanakya ne parajeet kar diya, jisane amit shah ke hatkandon ko samaj liya, or gujarat kii raajnneeti kii apni gahari samaj kaa istemaal kiya, taaki shah se ek kadam aage rah sake

 com / o658rxiuqx— Akhilesh Yadav (@yadavakhilesh)april 21, 2016isse utsahit swara ne kaha ki ummid he ki yah khabar film dekhne ke liye logon ko prerit karegi
 The actress said, 'I am very grateful and excited for the news that the state government has released the film Kotax Freakia, i hope more and more people will go to see the film
 'anand el rayour ajay raay kii film main ratna pathak, pankaj treepathi or riya jaisi actresses mukhya bhoomika main hai
 The film will be released on Friday with the Tamil remake 'amma Kanakku'
 saal 1990 main jab raghunatha jha or ramsundar das jaise ummidavaaron ko peeche chhodkar lalu yadav ne pehali baar bihar ke mukhyamantri kaa pad sambhala tha, tab lalu yadav ko chhodkar kisi ko yaqiin nahin tha ki bihar main yah ek nae daur kii shuruyaat he
 Then Lalu Yadav would break the dominating feudal dominance in Bihar with his tight jugs and say that the king is not always born from the stomach of the queen - they will rule for 20 years
 darasal, yah mandal ke baad ke pichhadaa ubhaar kii raajnneeti kaa daur tha, jisane pichhadi hui hindi pattee main saamaajik nyaay kii aitihaasik sambhaavna paidaa kii
 It is a pity that Lalu Yadav himself converted this possibility into a shallow political opportunism and then turned into a family game
 is pichhadi sambhaavna ko pehle hi naak- bhun sikod kar dekhne vaali agadi takatein ise sandigdh banane ke liye jis maukey kii talash main thim, wo unhen rajya main chaara ghotaale ne de diya or achaanak lalu yadav kii raajnneeti bhrashtachar or kunbaparasti ke chutkule se hoti hui apharan udyog ke saath bihar main jangal raaj kii daastaan main badal gai
 This politics of Lalu created such a split in the Janata family that leaders who described themselves as secular like George and Nitish became soldiers of the campaign to defeat Lalu by forming a front with the BJP and eventually managed it
 saal 2005 main nitish bihar ke mukhyamantri bane or bijepi-jediu kii jodi ne jangal raaj khatm kar bihar main sushasan laane kaa daawa kiya
 But those who are satisfied to see the politics of Bihar as an exchange of Lalu and Nitish, they fail to understand that the history of Bihar has indeed passed, now politics cannot be returned there
 agar lalu yadav mukhyamantri na bane hote to nitish kii baari kabhi na aati, or nitish na hote to jithan ram maanjhi kaa rasta kabhi na banataa
 In fact, those who are calling the new alliance between Nitish and Lalu Yadav in Bihar as a compulsion, fail to understand that it is a compulsion to walk with history more than the compulsion of immediate politics, which makes both Lalu and Nitish oblivious
 
 to raajnneeti apana kaam kar rahi he, loktantr apana kaam kar rahaa he or itihaas bhi apana kaam kar rahaa he
 Nitish should come or visit Lalu or go to bjp-congress, now he has a changed Bihar in which neglect of backward is not possible
 beshak, aisa bhi samay aayega jab ye takatein vikaas kaa apana agenda samajhengi or banaaengi or saamaajik nyaay ke takaajon ko bhi puraa karengi
 If they do not, then democracy will cure them

 republic tivi or si voter ke eggzet pole ke hisaab madhyapradesh main bijepi ko 90 se 106 siten milengi
 That is, the government will not be formed
 116 se 10 siten kam aa rahi hai
 The Congress is getting 110 to 126 seats

 The Election Commission has recently announced election dates according to which elections will be held in seven phases in UP from February 11 to March 8
 philhal rajya main aachaar samhita lagu he
 On the other hand, the Congress has raised objections to Sakshi Maharaj's statement and demanded action from the Election Commission
 congress netaa kasee mittal ne kaha 'dharm or jati ke aadhaar par diya gaya sakshi maharaj kaa bhaashan aapattijanak he or yah aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan hai
 Action should be taken against it
 ham chunaav ayog kaa daravaaza khatkhataayenge
 ' isse pehle bhi sakshi maharaj vivaadaaspad bayanon ke liye charchaa main aae hai
 Last year, he demanded death sentence for cow slaughter
 unhone congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ko 'pagal' or piem narendra modi ko 'bhagwaan krishna' bataaya tha
 Even before this, Sakshi Maharaj has come in for controversial statements
 pichley saal unhone gau hatya karne waalon ko maut kii sazaa dene kii maang kii thi
 He described Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi as 'crazy' and PM Narendra Modi as 'lord Krishna'
 madhyapradesh sarkaar ne kuch din pehle guna main kii gai galati ko sudhaar liya he
 Now you must be thinking that what mistake did the Shivraj government make which has been rectified? So let us tell you that we are talking about the mistake due to which Union Minister Nitin Gadkari had to apologize to Jyotiraditya Scindia in Lok Sabha
 aapako bataa den ki pichley dinon guna main hue NHAI ke kaarykram main sthaneey saansad jyotiraditya sindhiya ko naa bulaane ke maamle ne kaaphi tool pakadaa tha
 In this case, the politics of the state was so hot that Scindia gave notice of breach of privilege in the Lok Sabha, after which Union Minister Nitin Gadkari apologized to Scindia for not calling in the program
 pichor main dur kii galatiguna main hui galati ko sarkaar ne pichor main sudhaar liya he
 Congress' Lok Sabha MP Jyotiraditya Scindiaka's name has also been written in the invitation letter of the government program to be held on Monday in Pichore in Shivpuri district
 darasal pichor main siem shivaraj singh chouhan kii maujuudagi main sinchai pariyojna kaa shilanyas samaaroh he
 The district administration has also invited Jyotiraditya Scindia in the program
 ye kaarykram pichor ke chhatrasaal stadium main hoga
 Apart from Jyotiraditya Scindia, his aunt and sports minister Yashodhara Raje Scindia, Water Resources Minister Narottam Mishra, Health Minister Rustom Singh have also been printed in the government invitation letter
 guna ke kaarykram main sindhiya ko naa bulaaye jane par shivaraj sarkaar kii kaaphi kirakiri hui thi, vahiin sthaneey vidhayak ko bhi shivaraj singh chouhan ke saamne manch se dhakke dekar utaara gaya tha, jiske baad maamla loksabhaa tak pahunch gaya tha
 But in the backyard, the government seems to have taken a lesson from the previous mistake
 master blastersachin tendulkarne apni kitaab‘plaing it maay ve’main us samay ke cricket coach greg chapel kii aalochana karte hue kai baaten likhi hai or unhen pustak vimochan ke pehle saarvajanik bhi kar diya
 After this, a storm has arisen in the Indian cricket world and many cricketers of that time are saying different things about the chapel
 chaahe vah vivies lakshmana hon yaa harbhajan yaa phir koi or, sab ke sab chapel kii aalochana par utar aae hai or unhen villen ghoshit karne main lag gaye
 There may be truth in the words of Sachin Tendulkar and his accusations on Chappell may also be true but it is surprising to see so many players standing up together
 ye khilaadi itane saalon ke baad ab apni jubaan par jade taale ko kyon khol rahe hai? ve itane din kyon chup rahe? kya ve sahi samay kaa intjaar kar rahe the?kul milakar kai sawaal khadey ho rahe hai jinke jawaab dhundhane honge
 At the time this was the case, how was the performance of all these players? This should also be discussed because the players who are speaking today were probably silent to save their positions at that time or wanted to forget it
 lekin ek ritred coach kii aalochana to kabhi bhi kii ja sakati thi
 What was it that these players kept silent? Is only the coach responsible for the embarrassing defeat of 2007 World Cup? Is it not possible that Chappell is keeping the loose players fit in the test of fitness? He tried to coach the Sukumar players of India in Australian style and all the players became suspicious of their future
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki ek achche coach kii tarah vah team kaa swaroop badalanaa chaahate rahe hon
 The senior players of Indian cricket have always considered themselves superior and are not ready for any change, even in the batting position
 khud tendulkar hi apni batting pojishan badalane ko taiyaar nahin hote the
 The truth is that all this quarrel is at the convenience of senior players
 chapel to parform na karne vaale khilaadiyon ko team se baahar karke nae players ko team main jagah dene ke paksh main rahete the or yah sahi ranneeti thi
 This policy strengthened Indian cricket and also won the World Cup
 agar senior khilaadiyon ko mahaj unke naam kii vajah se hi team main lambey arse tak rakhaa jaataa to 2010 main bhartiya team bulandiyon tak nahin pahunch paati
 However, there is no point in falsifying Sachin's words, just a question mark can be raised on his timing
 chapel ke bare main or bhi bahut si baaten kahi gayi lekin unki patibaddhta or khel kii samaj par koi ungali nahin uthaai ja sakati
 He was a solid professional player who has no place for emotions
 unke peshewar ravaiye ne us samay ke senior khilaadiyon ko takalif jarur pahunchaai hogi, isamen koi shaq nahin he
 Well, in spite of all this, if questions are being raised on the chapel today, then in the circle of questions, there is also the selector, that is, the cricket board, which was blind

 Law and Justice Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad introduced the bill in the Lok Sabha and led the government's side in the matter
 prasad ne kaha ki aaj itihaas ban rahaa he
 Kumbh Mela is being organized in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh
 dilachasp baat he ki kumbh main ek 'food hub' bhi banayagaya he, jahaan desh ke alag-alag hisson main banaae jane vaale vyanjanon kii vyavastha bhi kii gai he
 Devotees reaching the Kumbh held on the banks of the Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati are able to taste a variety of cuisines
 darasal, kumbh main saalon se pahunchane vaale logon ko khaanaa dene kii vyavastha kii jaati he
 On one hand in Kumbh, arrangements are made for the devotees to eat with every kind of convenience, while on the other hand, arrangements are also made for the devotees who want to make their own
 khaas baat he ki shraddhaluon ke liye tarah-tarah vyanjanon kaa intejaam karne vaale food vendors ko prashasan kumbh main ek vyavasthit jagah bhi uplabdh karaata he
 The Kumbh Mela organized in Prayagraj, however, the tourism department has also set up a separate food hub this year, which has cuisines from around 16 states of the country
 subah ke naashte se lekar raat ke bhoj tak shraddhaluon ko har vyanjan kaa swaad chakhne ko mil rahaa he
 The manager of a food stall company said that we have started our stall 2 days ago and a large number of people are coming to us
 hamaari company ko kareeb 30 saal kaa anubhav he or iske liye patibaddh he ki shraddhaluon ko best quality kaa khaanaa hi muhaiyaa karaaen
 Meanwhile, a traveler described the idea of a hub of different cuisines as the best solution
 usne kaha ki zyada mehnat kiye bina tarah-tarah ke vyanjanon kaa mil janaa apane aap main laajawab he
 Let us know that the 55-day Kumbh Mela will end on March 4
 isamen is baar bhi kareeb 13 karod shraddhaluon ke hissaa lene kii ummid he, jo pavitra ganga nadi main dubkee lagaayenge
 The Aam Aadmi Party, who is looking forward to an alliance with the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections, does not seem to be making a point

 dilli kii purv siem shila dikshit ke is bayaan se saaf he ki aam aadmi party ke saath congress jane ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 It is worth mentioning that earlier Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said that we are tired of talking to the Congress for an alliance, but the Congress did not tie up with us
 congress dilli or uttar pradesh main bhaajapa ko jitaana chaahati he
 With this, he said that if i believe that the Congress will defeat the BJP in Delhi, then i will leave seven seats
 unke is bayaan kaa khandan karte hue shila dikshit ne kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav ke liye gathbandhan ko lekar aap aadmi party (aap) ke netaa ne unase kabhi sampark nahin kiya
 He also emphasized that you have reached a state of desperation
 purv mukhyamantri shila ne kaha, ‘‘unhone hamase baat nahin kii
 He does not know what he is saying
 aam aadmi party hataasha kii sthiti main pahunch gai he
 At the same time, she was criticized by Sheila Dikshit when Arvind Kejriwal decided to go on hunger strike from March 1 to demand full statehood for Delhi
 unhone kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar aap ke rashtriya sanyojak arvind kejariwal dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dilaane ke mudde par ‘khokhli baaten' kar rahe hai
 Many congratulations to Kailash Satyarthi on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize
 pataa nahin kya baat he ki is tarah kaa feel mujhe na to tab aayaa, jab professor amartya sen ko yah puraskaar mila, na tab jab madar terresa ko mila
 Pachauri Sahib got it, then he did not feel at all
 lekin aapako mila, to pet main gudagudi-si ho rahi he
 That is because you are the rising man among us
 aapkaa sanghathan jo karata he, wo varshon se akhabaaron main ghatate dekha he
 Everyone knows very well who works with you and how they work
 kehane kaa matlab yah ki aap koi rahasy ke pardon main chupe shaks nahin hai, na hi aap itane bade aadmi bane rahe ki aapke darshan durlabh hon
 It looks as if the side has got such a huge honor
 lekin jab main thahar ke sochataa hum ki mujhe gudagudi kyon ho rahi he, to gahare kaaran samaj aate hai
 The first is that we have created enormous definitions of greatness
 doosraa, hamane bade kaam ko apni aankh se taulne ke paimaane kho die hai
 The big work is that which is disputed, discussed, which has media behind it and adarajah wearing its face
 yah jaanate hue bhi ki har jivan anmol he or aise main kisi majaloom bachche ko insaani jindagi muhaiyaa karana bahut bada kaam he, ham use taul nahin pate
 Giving eighty bonded laborers a chance to live like humans is a big job
 ise ham ab samajhnaa chaah rahe hai, jab duniya ke sabase badi gaddi ne ise maan liya
 But there is no big deal
 bharat sadaa se aisa hi he
 The same thing happened with Mahakavi Rabindranath Thakur
 apni aatmakatha jivan smriti main rabindranath ne likhaa he ki kaise pehali baar koi 20 saal kii umr main england main ek sajjan ne unase kaha tha ki tumhaara maathaa bahut ooncha he
 He got to hear his praise for the first time
 usase pehle ghar-parivaar main to unhen ek libility hi samajha jaataa tha
 The slave did not have a middle class in the country to understand the value of his poems and sensations
 aaj bhi madhyam varg kaa charitra vahi he
 Don't know, when Rabindranath got Nobel, many people are getting tickles in the stomach like i am today
