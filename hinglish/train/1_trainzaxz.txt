 sarabhai ne kaha, ayog ne mujhase inkaar kar diya or tab maine unase patr likhakar kaha ki shrikumar ko is bare main halafanama daakhil karne ke liye kahana chahie
 The commission granted me permission and i requested Srikumar to file an affidavit on behalf of the commission, which he filed on Friday

 shrikumar ne kaha ki nahin main nahin jaanata
 He said, then the Chief Minister said that the public interest litigation he has filed is very dangerous for the government and i have sanctioned 10 lakh rupees who can stop it, Sanjeev Bhatt is aware of this, please give him from your secret fund Give 10 lakh rupees
 sarabhai ne kaha, is par shrikumar ne kaha ki gupt kosh main koi dhan nahin he

 unke kehane par shiv sainikon ne sonu nigam ko jaan se maarane kii koshish bhi kii thi
 'not only this, former MP Nilesh Rane also said,' While doing politics, we have never done any wrong things about Bal Thackeray
 iske baavjood mere pita narayan rane par gande aarope lagaae jate rahe hai
 Many truths of Bal Thackeray are buried
 'unhone kaha, 'logon ko bal thakare ki sachai ke bare main bhi bataanaa hoga
 Balasaheb was also responsible for the death of Shiv Sena leader Anand Dighe
 anand dighe kii hatya kii sajeesh kaise hui thi
 Whose death has occurred at Thackeray's Karjat farm house, i can tell publicly, but do not force me to
 'sach kholaa to thakare parivaar ke sharir par kapade tak nahin bachenge
 
 
 Nilesh Rane went on to say that Bal Thackeray's son Jayadev had told many things in the court
 wo mujhe bolne ke liye majaboor na karen
 If i tell the truth about him, leave the memorial, there will be no clothes left on the body of the Thackeray family
 khud log hi unke khilaaf ho jaaenge

 In such a situation, Karan Johar's production house is ready once again to give a dose of full entertainment
 kisi nilaamee ke liye dugadugi baja kar yaa munaadi laga kar elaan karne kii parampara band ho sakati he
 Attracting the public in this way would have its benefits, but market regulator Sebi feels that these methods have become a thing of the past and in today's times, new methods can give better results
 asal main share evam pratibhuti bazaar niamak bhartiya pratibhuti vinimay board (sebi) ko shulk bharne main chook karne yaa aadesh ke anusaar bhugtan na karne vaali ikaayiyon kii sampatti bech kar vasuuli karne ke adhikaar he
 At the time of review of these rights, these old methods adopted during the auction came to light
 samachar agency pitiai ke mutabik, adhikariyon ne kaha ki sebi jurmaana, shulk, vasuuli kii raashi yaa rifund ke aadesh ke sambandh main vasuuli ke nae niyam taiyaar karne ke liye vitt mantralay se paraamarsh kar rahaa he
 SEBI has the authority to seize the assets and bank accounts of the defaulting defaulters in repaying the loan installments, arrest or detain the defaulter and appoint someone to manage the movable and immovable properties of the defaulters
 adhikari ke anusaar, sebi ne sarkaar ke samaksh prajentation main kaha, 'inakam tex act ke kuch praavdhaan puraane ho gayi hai, jaise ki dhol bajaanaa or saarvajanik nilaamee
 New methods like newspaper advertisement and e-auction can give better results
 ' sebi ne vasuuli ke tej or prabhavi tareekon ko amal main laane ke liye sarkaar ko niyamon main aavashyak sanshodhan karne ko kaha he
 Under the existing provisions of the IT Act, before confiscating any property, an order of attachment is made by imposing dugdugi or by placing munadi (call) near any known place or property to be seized
 iske alaava jabti ke aadesh ko ukt sampatti ke parisar main janata ko spasht rup se dikhne vaale sthaan par tathaa kar vasuuli adhikari ke offis ke board par chipkaana hota he
 The Ministry, in response to sebi's suggestion, said that the recovery provisions of the IT Act can be amended under the SEBI Act and this right rests with the Central Government
 at: isamen sanshodhan centre sarkaar ke banaaye niyamon ke aadhaar par hi hona chaiye
 Apart from this, SEBI has also made a provision to use 'mumbai' instead of 'bombay' for its headquarters
 sebi ne kareeb ek saal pehle yah tay kiya tha ki market intermediatory ke rup main sab brokar kii categiri ko khatm karegaa or uske hisaab se niyamon main badlaav bhi kiye gaye the
 Therefore, SEBI has suggested that the word 'sub broker' should also be removed from the Act

 Gujarat's ground reality states that the Muslims of Gujarat have embraced the BJP, forgetting the pain of the 2002 riots
 yahi vajah he ki pichley vidhansabha chunaav 2012 main bijepi ne ek darjan se zyada muslim bahulya siton par jeet kaa paracham laharaaya tha

 While BJP is opposed to bringing SC, ST within the purview of the creamy layer, reservation in promotions supports the formation of All India Judicial Service
 susheel modine kaha ki essi, asti atyaachaar nivaaran kanoon ek aisa hathiyaar he jiske kaaran koi bhi daliton par atyaachaar karne se darataa he
 No law should be weakened and relaxed in the name of abuse

 Sushil Modi gave clarification even after the word 'ram' was added to the name of the constitution maker Baba Saheb Ambedkar in the cleanliness given in the name of Ambedkar
 unhone kaha ki baba sahab ke naam ke saath kahin koi chhedchhad nahin kii gai he, balki samvidhan kii mul prati par swayan unhone jo apana naam likhaa he, uttar pradesh kii sarkaar ne sarkari dastavejon main uske istemaal kaa nirdesh diya he
 The BJP leader said that in the original copy of the Constitution, Baba Saheb signed his full name 'bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar'
 maharashtra main naam ke saath pita kaa naam likhane kii paripati he
 Baba Saheb's father's name was Ramji
 uttar pradesh kii sarkaar ne rajyadesh jari kar sabhi sarkari record main unke is puure naam ke prayog kaa nirdesh diya he

 The Indian government on Tuesday warned whatsapp for failing to prevent its platform from being misused
 soshal media plateforms par faili bacchon ko agava karne kii afvaahon ke chalate ek saal main kam se kam 29 logon ko peet-peet kar maar daalaa gaya
 This is whatsapp's plan
 whatsapp is taking many steps to stop the spread of fake messages and rumors
 company ne apane letters main bataaya he ki kai nae feechar test kiye ja rahe hai, jinhen aage lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 - To keep the users safe, more control and information will be given
 - company dotarafa ranneeti apnayegi, pehla, logon ko is tarah kaa niyantran or jaankaree diya jaae jisase ve surakshit rahen
 Second, to actively work to prevent the misuse of whatsapp
 - forward massej or kisi vyakti dwaara bheje gaye massej main antar kii spasht jaankaree hogi
 whatsapp is testing a feature in which the user will be able to know whether a message is coming forward or is original, in that case they will be able to decide whether to forward it or not
 -group admin yah nirnay lenge ki kisi group main sandesh koun bhej saktaa he, koun nahin
 This will prevent the spread of unwanted messages or rumors
 -kisi avaanchit sandesh ke prasaarit hone par yujar uski 'report' watsap ko de sakegaa or yaa use block kar sakegaa
 To educate the people, whatsapp will send content and literacy workshops will be organized about the news
 - is saal watsap ne afvaahon or farji news kii pahchaan ke liye fact checking sansthaaon ke saath milakar kaam shuru kiya he
 - The company has worked in this direction together with news channels in Brazil and the same can be replicated in India
 - bharat main company ne ek fact checking sanstha boom live kii seva deni shuru kii he
 The government had given a stern warning to whatsapp, owned by Facebook, that it should take immediate measures to stop the spread of 'malicious and explosive messages' which could increase the incidence of mob lynching
 soochna or praudyogiki mantralay dwaara di gai chetavanee main kaha gaya tha ki watsap is maamle main apni jimmedaari se batch nahin sakati
 whatsapp is also terrified by the violence! In its three-page reply, whatsapp has said that it is deeply concerned about the safety of the people and has taken steps to fight the terror of fake news and rumors
 duniya bhar main sabase zyada base bharat main rakhane vaali watsap ke diarector brian hennasi ne kaha he, 'ham hinsa kii in khaufnak ghatnaon ko lekar bhaybheet hai or aapane jo ahm mudde uthaae hai un par teji se karrwai karnaa chaahate hai

 'he said,' We are working with Indian researchers to understand the problem better
 saath hi aise badlaav kiye ja rahe hai jisase farji sandeshon ko failane se roka ja sake
 We cannot see the content of messages, so we block a message based on the user's report and how it is sent
 badi sankhya main bheje ja rahe sandeshon (jo kisi ek vyakti ke vash kii baat na ho) kii pahchaan ke liye mashiinon kaa istemaal karte hai or avaanchit automated sandeshon ko rokane kii apni kshamta main ham nirantar sudhaar kar rahe hai
 whatsapp cannot escape its responsibility, after this letter, Communications and Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told India today-aaj Tak, 'india has become a big digital power
 watsap ke bharat main sabase zyada folover hai, ham unka swaagat karte hai, lekin unhen apane ko sachet, jimmedaar or javabdeh bananaa hoga
 "he said," If he has built any platform, then he is equally responsible for its misuse
 ve in sandeshon kii jimmedaari or javabdehi se batch nahin sakate, khaskar aise sandesh jinase hatyaein ho rahi hon
 'only 25 per cent of the people are connected to a whatsapp group, however, there is still doubt about how effective whatsapp will be on malicious messages
 watsap cedeta seyah pataa chalata he ki bharat main sirf 25 fisadi log kisi watsap group se jude hai or zyaadaatar group main judane vaale logon kii sankhya 10 se kam hi he
 Nine messages are sent to each other in every ten
 aise main group admin ke saath sakhti yaa un par ankush se bahut phayda nahin hone vaala
 Therefore, the Ministry also insists that something has to be done for messages sent from person to person
 isliye sarkaar watsap par dabaav bana rahi he ki vah ispletform paraprasarit sandeshon ke liye behatar filter or nigaraanee kii vyavastha banaae

 bijepi or shivasena ne milakar bahumat kaa 145 kaa aankada paar kar liya tha
 But Shiv Sena kept demanding 50-50 formula according to which the model of running the government was two and a half years
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki bijepi ke saath samjhauta isi formule par hua tha lekin bijepi kaa daawa he ki aisa koi samjhauta nahin hua
 This led to differences so much that the two-year old friendship of the two parties was broken

 philhal ab rajya main congress-ncp or shivasena ke gathbandhan vaali sarkaar he or siem uddhav thakare ko aaj vidhansabha main bahumat sabit karnaa he

 The novel Fifty Shades, written by James, is a unique world of wealthy businessman Christian Gray and commissary student Anastasia Steele

 Caroline Newbury, who handles the marketing and publicity of Random House Publishers India, says, "the series has sold 6 crores worldwide while two lakh copies have been sold in India

 She says, "today only the details of sex are being given

 At the same time, Maitreyi Pushpa feels that the lack of erotic literature in Hindi is due to male dominance, where a woman is awarded titles like 'chhinal' as she writes a little openly

 First Osama bin Laden, Kheer Wale Baba Rampal, seventy-seven Huron greed, then Areeb, a thousand crores engineer Yadav Singh with two surnames from Uttar Pradesh, and now Mehdi Masroor Biswas, who runs the Twitter account of IS; What is the commonality among all of them? If we remove the fact that they all earned a name in disrepute, there is still a similarity in them, all of them were either engineers or were associated with engineering in some way
 osama pehle civil ejeeniyar tha, rampal ejeeniyar kii naukari se nikaala gaya tha, arib ejineering kar rahaa tha, yadav singh or mehadi naukari main the, matlab chaahe ejeeniyar naukari kare, berozegaar ho, padhai kar rahaa ho, ejineering chhod chukaa ho, ejeeniyar har haal main khatarnaak hota he
 It is not that all engineers are misguided, whether Arvind Kejriwal or Chetan Bhagat, they too earned a different name when they decided to leave engineering and move to other fields, but always remain at the center of criticism, the question arises whether such Charas bo laid in engineering studies? Does this type of food live for the world? Who has made the engineers so dissatisfied? When will engineers return home? The answer will be found from where someone starts becoming an engineer
 kindergarton ke bhi pehle se tay kar diya jaataa he ki baccha ejeeniyar banegaa, ab yahaan ‘bachche se puuchhie wo kya chahta he?’ vaali ghisi-pity baat hatie; aane vaale kuch saalon main use ‘ejeeniyar’ shabd itani baar sunaaya jaataa he ki koi jabade ko thodaa sa peeche le jaakar nichle honton ko dantapankti par chadha jeebh se taalu ko chhu ‘i
 
 ’ bole iske pehle hi baccha saat bhaant ke intrens test, atharah krash course, desh bhar ke das-pandrah institute ke fees strecchar se lekar infrastracchar tak ke bare main teen baar doharaa chukaa hota he
 Frustration arises when, upon reaching college, learns about the Varna system, all the upper castes are Palmer with iits
 yakeen maaniye iaiti ko chhod saadhaaran se kisi ejineering college main admician lene kii baat bhi kisi ke aage kahen to aisa vyavhaar kiya jayega jaise brahmahatya kii baat sweekaar kar lee ho
 Where will this guilt go, this frustration will come out somewhere? In four years of study, after forty-forty-two papers, dozens of practicals, major-minor projects, apprentices, hundreds of sessional and mid-term, where is the space left for human emotion? In the spring, when everyone is celebrating Madnotsav, while not taking a fortnight for a fortnight, a Rampal, while taking a practical file, distributed it among the devotees by taking a bath with milk, then which mountain broke? What is the fault of that innocent-nerd-gabhuar-wandering Areeb if he finds it more relaxing to clean the toilets for ISIS than leave engineering for fear of semester exams? There is a lot to be 'yadav' in Uttar Pradesh, but even if someone is able to maintain thousand and two thousand crores with 'engineer' in front of his name and 'lion' behind, then how far would it be justified to send him to jail? And the worst happened, with 'mehdi Masroor Biswas' as big as his name is, till the semester is over, In the first sem, the seniors must have teased him about this name, if any such person had run an account named 'IS' from a little cute, then what is the need to bring engineers in the mainstream, to tell them that we too One is only to show them trees and plants on holiday, not getting admission in IIT is not a sin like killing someone, batting them at least twice a month How does it feel to feel when the water touches the body? It is important to tell those trapped in coding, assemblers, compilers and dead lines that they are not just programmers, to make a hindu-muslim 'homecoming' When will we bring back engineers? And the biggest thing is when will they stop becoming jokes? It is time that we go to Chet all the time or else the engineers will pull out their woes as Kheer, Twitter account, IS toilets, crores of rupees and half-girlfriends

 a consensus has been reached among EU leaders to get Greece out of the government debt crisis
 iske tahat bank greece kii sarkaar ko die karj kii aadhi raashi ko ab apane nuksaan ke rup main sweekaar karenge
 In this way, the debt burden will come down on the Greek government
 brussels main europea sangh ke netaaon kii apaat baithak ke baad sangh ke adhyaksh harman vaan rompay ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki greece sarkari karj ko lekar bainkon ke saath ek samjhaute par pahunchaa gaya he

 The day the country's foreign minister Sushma Swaraj made a statement on Pakistan on the same day, Hafiz Saeed, considered the mastermind of the Mumbai attacks, tweeted that even after 7 years, there is no evidence that Pakistan's 26 / 11 Mumbai hand Was under attacks
 yah waapas us sawaal ko laata he ki pakistan hafiz said jaisi awaajon ko chup nahin kara saktaa
 The comments iske baavjood ki haal main sushamaa swaraj ne pakistan jaakar yah ghoshnaa kii ki bharat or pakistan ke bich samgr vaarta kaa silsilaa jari rahegaa, yah is baat ko bhi sabit karata he ki pakistan main siyaasi hukumat se baat karnaa alag baat he, lekin bharat virdohi awaajon ko aisi hukuumaten kabhi nahin roak paaengi
 Hafiz Saeed is repeating the same thing, despite giving many proofs and documents that Pakistan had denied its hand in 26 / 11 since its inception
 hafiz said ke bayaan ke baad hameshaa yah sawaal uthta rahegaa ki pakistan se baatcheet kaa aakhirkaar nateeja kya nikalataa he
 Despite that recently, Sushma Swaraj went to Pakistan and announced that the continuation of the composite dialogue between India and Pakistan would continue, it also proved that it is a different thing to talk to the political regime in Pakistan, but the anti-india voices Will never stop such rules
 pakistan ne shuruyaat ke samay se hi 26 / 11 main apana haath hone se inkaar kiya tha is bare main anek saboot or dastavej dene ke baad bhi hafiz said usee baat ko doharaa rahaa he
 After Hafiz Saeed's statement, the question will always arise that what is the end result of talks with Pakistan

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki aresas ke manahani maamle main unhone koi galati nahin kii he or unhen gunaah kabool nahin
 a day before this, Rahul Gandhi claimed that the founder of coca-cola used to sell shikanji first
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii manahani ke cese main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi par bhiwandi court ne aarope tay kiya he
 Charges have been framed against Rahul under sections 499 and 500 of IPC
 congress ke obisi sammelan main coca-cola, mcdonald, ford motors,marcides bengeaur honda ke bare main rahul gandhi kaa gyaan or manahani maamle main bhiwandi kii court main unka pesh hona vipaksh ke liye galat samay par hone vaale vaake hai
 At a time when opposition parties are trying to unite against the NDA for the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, Rahul Gandhi's statements are going to undermine the confidence of his party and potential allies
 karnataka membijapi ko kinare kar satta main aane se congressi utsahit hai
 In the recent Lok Sabha and Assembly by-elections also, the BJP lost many seats
 khaskar rahul gandhi kaa yah bayaan ki coca-cola ek shikanji vaale ne shuru kiya tha, unke ek paripakv raajnneetijna hone par sawaal khadaa karata he
 The Congress president will have to consistently show that he deserves to become the undisputed leader of the opposition in 2019
 samay-samay par rahul gandhi ne ek ubharate netaa ke gun pradarshit bhi kiye hai
 But before people make a good image about him, he himself does something that his image gets discounted
 april 2015 main 56 din ke vishram se lautne ke baad rahul gandhi ne aakraamakata or paripakvata dikhaai thi
 He attacked PM Modi and BJP with many similes like 'suit-boot Ki Sarkar'
 unhone pichley saal gujarat chunaav main bijepi ko bachaav kii mudra laane main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 His visits to temples and highlighting the flaws of the central government benefited the Congress in Gujarat
 haal main karnataka or upachunaavon main congress kii safalataa kaa rahul gandhi ko bhi phayda mila
 He even declared himself a candidate for PM in 2019
 lekin haal kii do ghatnaon ne bijepi ke khilaaf rahul gandhi kii ladaai ko kamjor kiya he
 First, Rahul's fight against this organization has weakened after former President Pranab Mukherjee went to Nagpur RSS headquarters
 rahul gandhi sangh ke khilaaf kaaphi hamalavar rahe hai
 Rahul had alleged that, 'mahatma Gandhi was killed by RSS people
 ' rahul ke is bayaan par maharashtra main bhiwandi ke ek aresas swayamsevak ne manahani kaa mukadmaa kar diya
 In this connection, Rahul Gandhi has to appear in Bhiwandi court twice this year
 aresas ke khilaaf unki ladaai to kund hui hi he, unke aakraamak tareeke se bayaanbaji or daavon se unki vishwasaneeyata bhi kamjor hui he
 On June 6, Rahul Gandhi visited Mandsaur on the death anniversary of farmers firing in MP
 unhone vahaan apane bhaashan main food chen, mobile phone kii menuphaccharing or rojgaar jaise kai masalon par empi or centre sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa
 But after disasters, Rahul Gandhi's image has been tarnished by Rahul Gandhi's questions on entrepreneurship opportunities in the country
 yah sab congress or un vipakshi dalon ke liye nuksaandeh ho saktaa he jo 2019 main bijepi se ladane ke liye ekajute hone kii koshish main lage hai
 Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh said that there is evidence of alleged corruption and irregularities against the kin of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and BJP leader LK Advani but the Congress will never use it to harass them
 digjivay singh ne sonia gandhi ke damaad robert wadra ko jameen ke saudon main anuchit phaayde dene ke liye wadra, dlef or haryana kii congress sarkaar ke bich santhganth ke aaropon ko bhi khaarij kar diya
 Defending Sonia, she said that she is not the 'chartered Accountant' of Vadra to keep track of her growing wealth
 digvijay singh ne kaha, ‘rajg sarkaar ke dauraan anek chijen saamne ain
 But not only me, did the Congress party ever use them
 ham kabhi inkaa istemaal nahin karenge
 If i say that i do not have these (evidence against the relatives of Vajpayee and Advani) then it will not be correct
 ’ congress mahasachiv se unke isi bayaan ke bare main sawaal poocha gaya tha ki unke paas vaajapeyi or adwani ke rishtedaaron ke khilaaf saboot hai
 Singh, while answering the questions, also said that the evidence he had can lead to allegations of corruption and irregularity and it would be an embarrassment for both the senior leaders
 congress mahasachiv ne yah bhi kaha, ‘netaa insaan hote hai
 We are not God
 ham apane anginat rishton par najar yaa rokthaam nahin rakh sakate
 When Singh was asked why he was not exposing the evidence against Vajpayee and Advani's relatives, he said, "why should i become a complainant
" ’ singh ke mutabik is tarah ke maamalon ko dekhne ke liye anek praadhikaar hai or sansad he
 Rejecting the allegations against Vadra, Singh said that the allegations made against dlf-vadra land deals are not true
 jab digvijay singh se sawaal kiya gaya ki kya sonia ko wadra kii badhati sampatti kii jaankaree thi or kya unhone kabhi is par sawaal kiya to singh ne kaha ki kya ‘damaad ke khaaton kaa hisaab rakhane kaa kaam bhi saas kaa he
 He said, "sonia Gandhi is not Robert Vadra's chartered accountant
 ’unhone kaha ki kya sonia gandhi ne kabhi wadra ke bare main mukhyamantri yaa mantriyon se baatcheet kii he? aap sonia gandhi par us kaam ke liye nishaanaa nahin saadh sakate jo unhone kiya hi nahin
 Singh said, 'I am a leader
 lekin mere rishtedaar kya karte hai wo dekhnaa meraa kaam nahin he
 According to Digvijay, he too has four daughters-in-law but what he is doing does not make sense to him
 dlef or wadra ke bich jameen saudon ko lekar baar-baar puche gayi sawaalon par singh ne kaha ki iskaa jawaab dlef ko dena chahie

 He said that Vadra comes from a prestigious family and it is not that he did not have any property before marrying Priyanka Gandhi
 singh ne in dharanaon ko bhi khaarij kiya ki haryana ke iees adhikari ashok khemka kaa tabadalaa aanan fanan main isliye kar diya gaya kyonki unhone wadra ke jameen saudon kii jaanch shuru kar di
 He said, 'did Vadra complain against Khemka
 mukhya sachiv ne khemka ko bulaayaa or khemka ne kaha ki vah puri tarah santusht hai
 Asked about Vadra's controversial statement on 'mango Man in Banana Republic', Singh said that the first word is a literal translation of 'aam aadmi' and has a lot of humor but he considered using the second word (banana Republic) Is not right
 digvijay ne in dharanaon ko bhi darkinar kar diya ki wadra maamle se congress or gandhi parivaar kii chhavi ko nuksaan pahunchaa he
 He said that DLF and Haryana government have presented point-wise facts on the allegations

 The government's eyes are in correcting its more visible figures than improving its performance
 aisa hi jan dhan khate ke jamaa ke aankadon main hua he
 Actually, there was a lack of data on the account
 or is bare main mangalvaar kii subah ek twit hote hi ghante bhar ke bheetar iske aankade fouran badal die gaye
 The story behind it is probably more interesting than the figures
 jandhan khaaton main is saal april ke maheene tak jamaa kii raashi 80,000 karod ko paar kar gai thi
 But on July 4, 2018, this amount reduced to just 62,919
 08 karod rah gai
 This was the lowest deposit in the last 19 months
 lekin khaas baat yah ki may ke baad se is jamaa main 20,000 karod ru
 Has decreased
 yani, logon ne khaaton se paise nikaalnaa shuru kiya
 It is a matter of doubt that in the week of June 27 to July 4, 16,000 crore rupees within seven days
 kii nikasi hui he
 As soon as India Today editor Anshuman Tiwari tweeted about it, the figures quickly swung into action and changed the number of deposits
 gajab yah ki ve shaayad baaki ke aankade badalanaa bhul gaye
 For example, in the original figure, the number of beneficiaries in the branches of rural and town banks is 18
 82 karod thi
 Number of account holders in urban and metro branches 13
 12 karod thi
 Total number around 31
 95 karod labhaarthiyon kii thi
 Some of these have not changed in the new figures
 khate main jamaa kii rakam 62,919
 08 crores Rs
 thi
 Among these, 4 xxrep 4 8 in public banks
 36 karod ru
 , 13788 in Regional Rural Banks
 70 karod ru
 And 2242 in private banks
 02 karod ru
 The deposit was shown
 twit ke baad adwatan kiye gaye aankadon main sirf jamaa kii rakam hi badali ja saki he
 It has the same number of account holders of all banks
 kul labhaarthiyon kii sankhya main koi badlaav nahin hua he
 While the amount of the deposit has been shown to increase
 inamen saarvajanik bainko main 62921
 37 crores Rs
 , kshetreey gramin bainkon main 13788
 70 crores Rs
 or nijee bainkon main 2242
 02 crores Rs
 jamaa dikhaaya gaya tha
 That is, the amount of this deposit has been shown only in public banks
 ab yah kaisaa hisaab he or twit ke turant baad aankade kaise rifresh kiye gaye yah to sirf vitt mantralay hi bataa saktaa he

 Party workers are disappointed in the bjp-ruled three states lagging behind the Congress but the BJP leadership is more worried than disappointed
 chintit hone kii saamaanya vajah yah nahin he ki bhaajapa teen rajyon main pichhadi balki isliye he kyonki hindi pattee ke teenon rajya main congress majbootee se jam gai
 Even after leaving Rajasthan (where the government usually changes in five years) in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, after fifteen years, the political ground for the Congress has become green
 centre kii satta ke liye kisi bhi siyaasi dal ke liye yah jaruri he ki hindi pattee (10 rajya) main acha pradarshan kare
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP won 191 seats from the Hindi belt
 rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main 62 siten bhaajapa ne jiti thi
 In Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh 15 years ago, the Congress was dislodged
 in donon rajyon main sanghathan or netritv ke maamle main congress kaa koi cheharaa nahin rahaa
 But in the elections held just a few months before the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress got a face in these three states
 chhattisgarh main congress ko siem or party adhyaksh kaa cheharaa milegaa
 In Madhya Pradesh too, leaders like Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia were established by this election
 digvijay singh ke rup main pehle kii tarah sirf ek netaa madhya pradesh congress kii pahchaan nahin rahegaa
 Actually this is the concern of the BJP leadership
 hindi pattee ke in teenon pramukh rajyon main congress apane pradarshan ke boote bhaajapa ke saamne aa dati he
 In a way, for 2019, the Congress in the Hindi belt states has got a big base to compete with the BJP
 jis tarah se 2019 ke liye bhaajapa ke khilaaf mahagathbandhan banane kii kavayad shuru ho gai he vaise main hindi pattee main congress kaa sthapit hona siyaasi lihaaj se bhaajapa ke liye chintaa kii vajah he

 For this, one and a half lakh rupees were transferred through Paytm
 police ne cese darj kar jaanch shuru kii to pataa nahin chalaa
 But meanwhile, the accused made a mistake that they paid the electricity bill through Paytm
 or police isi tranjection ke jariye aropiyon tak ja pahunchi
 According to the police, the accused were making people a victim of their own fraud for the last 7 months

 input IANS Facing criticism from political enemies, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has now been targeted in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'saamana'
 sidhaa-sidhaa hamalaa karte hue kejariwal ko 'yeda' bataate hue kaha gaya he ki unase behatar prashaasak to raakhi saavant ho sakati hai
 The editorial of 'saamana' states that the Aam Aadmi Party is like an 'item girl'
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne likhaa he ki jo log raakhi saavant kii aalochana karte hai unhen ab raakhi kaa abhinandan karnaa chahie
 Uddhav agreed with the statement of Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and called Arvind Kejriwal as 'yeda'
 marathi main 'yeda' kaa hindi arth 'pagal' he
 The mouthpiece of the Shiv Sena reads, 'the kind of spectacle that Kejriwal has done in front of Parliament has shaken the head of every political party
 aam aadmi party kaa agar yahi culture he to phir is baat se sahamat hona padegaa ki ve araajaktaa chaahate hai
 And there are anti-national elements behind it
 'iske alaava sampadakeey main ye baaten kahi gai hai-- desh main kuch nae paaglon kaa udai hua he or ek pagal (yeda) arvind kejariwal inkaa mukhiya he
 - Kejriwal has used singular and derogatory terms in reference to Sushil Kumar Shinde
 kya unki yahi samskruti he? ye to white collar aparaadhiyon or choron kii bhashaa he
 - Arvind Kejriwal, who was critical of the politics of politics till yesterday, is doing the same today
 to aise main aam aadmi party alag kaise?- or to or unheen ke samarthak rahe chetan bhagat shame mahasoos kar rahe hai or AAP ko item girl kar rahe hai, susheel kumaar scindia ne unhen pagal kaha he or ensipi ke deepi treepathi ne unhen saanp kah diya he
 - In this circus there is another clown (joker) named Kumar Vishwas and he had to apologize for his remarks that insulted women
 - apane paagalpan se kejariwal ne yah sabit kar diya he ki ve khud aam aadmi ke dushman hai
 - Kejriwal's madness will not last long, but an item girl can dance as long as she wants

 desh kii arthvyavastha is samay mandi ke daur se guzar rahi he
 The state of the economy has become thin due to continuously decreasing growth rate and ending jobs
 takreeban har sector main baari giravat darj kii ja rahi he lekin aise vakt main bhi ek industry khub fal phool rahi he
 We are talking about the Bollywood industry which seems to be in a different mood this year
 ye sach he ki desh kii arthvyavastha ko lekar chintajanak halaat hai, lekin aise vakt main bhi log ghar se baahar nikal kar filmein dekh rahe hai, or sirf dekh nahin rahe balki khub enjoy bhi kar rahe hai
 Now we are not making such a claim
 balki agar ham is saal relies hui filmon par najar daudaayenge, to pataa chalata he ki ye saal box offis collection ke lihaaj se laajawab sabit hua he
 This year, many such films have been released which have earned hugely at the box office
 box offis kaa pichley 6 maheene kaa report karbgar sirf pichley 6 maheenon main relies hui filmon kii baat karen, to jo aankada nikal kar saamne aata he wo chaunkaa dene vaala he
 In the last 6 months Bollywood films have done business of about 1,565 crores
 is main saaho, chhichhore,war, bala,dream girl, housephul 4, mishan mangal jaisi superhit filmein shaamil hai
 The amazing thing is that some of these films were made, they were in a very low budget, but still they hit an entry in the 100 crore club
 mandi kaa bollywood industry par koi asar nahin?in aakadon ko dekhakar ye sawaal to aata hi he ki kya mandi kaa bollywood industry par koi asar nahin padataa? ab yahaan par ye samajhane kii jarurat he ki bollywood filmon kaa acha collection karne kaa matlab ye nahin he ki desh kiarthvyavasthasarapat daud rahi he
 Rather it simply shows that people go to watch movies to improve their mood and for entertainment
 aasaan shabdon main darshak wo film dekhnaa pasand karte hai jiskaa content badhiya hota he
 In such a situation, content-driven films continue to be made throughout the year, whether the country's economy is good or bad
 yahi kaaran he ki saal 2019 main kamjor arthvyavastha hone ke baavjood bollywood industry kii chaandi hoti rahi
 Recall that the same round also came in 2008
 us vakt desh mandi kii maar jhel rahaa tha lekin bollywood industry par iskaa koi asar nahin padaa
 Film Industry 7 that year
 7% raftaar se aage badi
 Now something similar is being seen this year, which proves that if films with good content continue to be produced, then the box office collection will continue

 After that when i walk it feels like you are feeling like a rape victim
 haalanki, mujhe aisa nahin kahana chahie
 'what was written in the interview? On the other hand, the website quoted the interview as saying,' It was very difficult for me to riot in the ring
 ek din hamen chah ghanton tak lagaataar shooting kerani thi
 During this time i had to do a lot of lifting in the ground
 mere liye yah aasaan nahin tha, kyonki is dauraan mujhe 120 kilogram ke shaks ko 10 alag-alag angel main patakana tha
 i was also beaten on the ground several times
 jab shoot ke baad ring se baahar nikal rahaa tha to mujhe laga ki main ek aisi mahila hum, jiske saath rape hua he
 i could not walk at all
 maine iske baad kuch khaaya, sir sidhaa kiya or phir training ke liye chalaa gaya

 He should withdraw his statement, because millions of people can follow his statement

 In fact, Tejapratap attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Twitter on the issue of demonetisation on Monday and questioned the deaths of people standing in queues of banks and atms during demonetisation
 haal hi main cashles bhugtan ke liye pradhanmantri modi ne jis BHIM ap ko launch kiya he or jise pichley 5 dinon main takreeban 30 lakh se zyada logon ne downlod kiya he
 On this app too, Tej Pratap lashed out at Prime Minister Modi

 a Twitter user wrote, 'VIM no BHIM, at least know the name of the man and his spellings, which your family has always taken political advantage
 sharmnaak !!
 Interestingly, during the Prakash Parv last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had informally met Lalu Prasad and his son Tej Pratap, and among other things, Prime Minister Modi has been taunting him about Tej Pratap's Krishna Rupi avatar

 input-ians Rajesh Khanna 1942-2012 India's first superstar Rajesh Khanna was appreciated and loved by his fans for many years, but he could not be recognized in the intellectual world
 sattar ke dashak kii shuruyaat main ve bade nayak the, baavjood iske amitabh bachchan kii chamakdaar or dheer-gambhir shakhsiyat kaa grahan un par aisa laga ki film industry main unki bhoomika ko hi nazarandaaj kar diya gaya
 Rajesh Khanna was not 'cool'
 ve ek bhole-bhaale madhyavargeey ladke kii tarah the
 He was not a classic handsome but rather handsome
 akasar apane chust safari suut or thode sakht baalo main kuch ajeeb-se lagate the
 But the moment he smiled with a slight bend of his neck and blinked the eyelids, looking at the camera, his attraction became unbearable and the women started wailing cold sighs
 aisi adaa ek pal ko unki apni jaan padati or unki bholi-bhali shakhsiyat sidhe ankhon se apane chaahane waalon ke saath ek kareebi rishta jod leti thi
 His simple image, innocent style and seductive charm became a total antidote
 yahi vah adaa thi jisane film daag (nirdeshkah yash chopra, 1973) ke ant main chaahane waalon ko is baat ke liye raji kar liya ki do shaadiyaan karke bhi chaiyn se rahaa ja saktaa he or yah behad saamaanya baat he
 Who else could have done this? They usually played middle or upper middle class characters, who often lacked family support and were in search of love, who had been wounded by gum
 aise kirdaaron ke dard main bhi ek gussa hota tha, jo parade par nashe main duubakar or umdaa geeton ke jariye bayaan kiya jaataa
 For example, this is the love of Kati Kite (director: Shakti Samanta, 1970)
 rajesh khanna par kuch sadabahaar geet filmaae gaye, khaskar kishor kumaar ke gaae or aar
 D
 burman ke sangitabaddh kiye hue
 Yet one of his best performing films is Ittefaq (director: Yash Chopra, 1969), which did not contain any songs
 usamen unhone ek bhagode sandigdh hatyare kii bhoomika nibhaai he
 Her first major film was Aradhana (director: Shakti Samanta, 1969), in which she had a double role and Sharmila Tagore was the heroine
 hindi cinema ke sabase maadak geeton main se ek rup tera mastaana isi film main tha, jisamen camere or geet ke sanyog se ban rahe maadak maahaul main bandhanon se pare aakarshan main bandha kar premi-premika kaa ek duusare kii ore dekhnaa aisa drishy banaata tha jahaan 'bhul' honi to tay thi
 When Khanna returns in another role in the same film, Sharmila Tagore is his mother
 is clasik film ke dauraan jis kism kaa khinchaav donon ke bich paidaa hua tha usee kaa asar tha ki sharmila apane guru satyajit re ke saath bich main hi kaam karne chali gayi, jiske kaaran mere sapanom kii rani geet main sharmila vaale drishyon ko baad main alag se filmaaya gaya
 Khanna played a cancer patient in Anand (director: Hrishikesh Mukherjee, 1971)
 film kaa falsafa uske mahaan geet or dialog main hi bayaan ho jaataa he, ''jindagi badi honi chahie, lambii nahin
 "this film is not a death, but a celebration of life
" isamen pehali baar rajesh khanna or amitabh bachchan saath aae
 Mukherjee later reunited the duo in Salt Haram in 1973
 bangla lekhak bibhutibhushan bandopadhyaay kii kahani nishipadma par bani thi film amar prem (nirdeshkah shakti samant, 1972)
 On this story Satyajit Ray made Pather Panchali
 amar prem kii kahani veshyalay main bech di gai ek ladki par he, jise baad main prem ho jaataa he
 The song Chingari Koi Bhadke became very popular in this film
 iske alaava rajesh khanna kaa dialog, ''puspa, aai het tears'' filmi itihaas ke sunahare palon main ek he jise bolne ke baad ve khud rone lag jate hai
 Khanna's character is not limited to a romantic hero in all his best roles, but his films often establish love within the realm of wider family relationships, taking up subjects like illness, trade unionism, prostitution, animal welfare, etc
 unhen agar sirf romantic hero ke rup main yaad kiya jaataa he, to shaayad isliye ki unke kaam kaa sahi aalochanatmak moolyankan nahin hua he or upree taur par maan liya gaya he ki amitabh ke ubhaar ne unke upar grahan laga diya tha
 The songs filmed on him are perhaps the most romantic in the history of Hindi films, but they should also be seen in the context of Rajesh Khanna's overall work
 main kai baar bandra ke carter road par rajesh khanna ke bangale aashirwad ke paas se gujri hum
 He was quite neglected
 main khanna or hindi filmon main staradam ke bare main sochane par majaboor ho gai
 i am convinced of the dignified silence of his and family members in personal matters
 antim samay main jab sabhi ek saath aae to dekh kar khushi bhi hui
 The journey from the image of a non-urban male to stardom in the late sixties and early seventies demands a critical evaluation of Khanna's work
 hindi filmon ke bare main likhane vaala koi bhi vyakti unki upeksha nahin kar saktaa
 Recently i read a paper at Stanford University, in which my favorite film Elephant Mere Saathi (director: M
 e
 Tirumugam, 1971)
 inasaanon or jaanwaron ke bich fark par film main sawaal uthaaya gaya he or rajesh khanna iklaute shaks hai jo jaanwaron kaa sammaan karte hai or unke pyaar, samarpan ko samajhate hai

 In order to halt the arrogance of the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav has said that this party will remain one during his lifetime
 is ek vaakya main party ke tazaa ghatnakram kaa saar chipa he
 The party president is actually saying that he has the command of the party in his hands, and he is going to make his subsequent arrangements very wisely
 mulaayam ne spasht kar diya he kiakhilesh unke uttaradhikarihain, party kaa bhavishya hai, nirbaadh hai or kisi bhi niyantran yaa dabaav se mukt hai
 This was the first time Akhilesh had taken such a decision that he was related to one of the most important people in the family and the party
 mulaayam ne use palatney ke bajaay apane bete ke nirnay kii maryaada rakh lee he
 Now Akhilesh is not accountable to anyone other than his father in the party
 isse pehle kaa daanv sapa pramukh ne 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke pehle khelaa tha
 He asked Akhilesh Yadav as the young face of the party to take out a campaign against Mayawati across the state and prepare public opinion
 akhilesh ne yah zimmedaari nibhaai or chunaav main sapa ko spasht janadesh mila
 Many people could not guess when Akhilesh, who was on the throne of this mandate, surpassed his father's generation
 bahujan samaaj party se khinnata kaa janadesh akhilesh ko mili janadesh ke taur par bataaya gaya
 The gathering of Akhilesh's uncles and uncles forced him to bow down to this decision and Akhilesh became the Chief Minister of the country's largest political province
 khud mulaayam dwaara mukhyamantri pad kaa tyaag baaki logon ke liye udhaaharan bana rahaa or akhilesh ke mukhyamantri banane ke faisle ko lekar na chaahate hue bhi kitne hi varishton ke munh band hi rahe
 This was Mulayam's first wager
 ab aaie duusare par
 Sankat or dramasamajwadi Party's latest political crisis is the sequel of this political drama by Mulayam Singh Yadav
 sarkaar chalaate samay kunbe or party ke anya varisht chehre baghawat na karen, iske liye zaruri tha ki unhen unke man mutabik mantralay milen or apane tareeke se kaam karne kii azaadi
 In this way, Mulayam also kept the party and kept Akhilesh from the possible dangers
 lekin chunaav kii dahalij par khadi party main ab kunba apana hissaa maang rahaa he
 Everyone needs their share in ticket distribution
 tikat bantwaare ke aarthik pahalu bhi hote hai or apane kheme kii takat badhaane kii raajnneetik mahatvakankshaayen bhi
 Dealing with this is a very difficult task
 doosraa yah ki party or mulaayam singh yadav ko achche se pataa he ki apni apni dishaao main bhaagate 10 siron vaali rajya sarkaar kaa sabase bada nuksaan yah he ki har vyakti mukhyamantri ke rup main ek majboot or prabhutv sampann akhilesh ke bajaay ek puure kunbe ko mukhyamantri kii kursi par savaar dekhte hai

 is tilamilaahat main akhilesh ne unke mantralay chhine
 Shivpal, who held the party to the lowest level, finally emerged as a helpless general who had to kneel before Akhilesh
 akhilesh shaayad pehali baar itane majboot or adig najar aa rahe hai or wo bhi ek bahut hi ahm or majboot aadmi ke khilaaf jo khud unke kunbe se aata he
 This message is clear for the rest of the party and for the state
 ram gopal iske bazkhilesh kii sharanmen ja chuke hai
 Mulayam Singh has announced the return of Prajapati, taking out the compromise formula
 lekin tikaton ke bantwaare main shivpal or baaki netaaon ke liye spasht kar diya gaya he ki chalegi to sirf akhilesh kii
 The message is clear
 is drame ke sutaradhar mulaayam singh yadav or nayak akhilesh yadav ab ajey yoddha hai
 His party and family members have now been reduced to Akhilesh
 akhilesh ab party kaa bhavishya bhi hai or satta ke sheersh bhi
