 lekin karnataka or gujarat se party ke liye kuch acchhee khabar he

 Yeddyurappa is hoping to benefit from the rebellion
 udhar, gujarat main congress ke netaa 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main mukhyamantri narendra modi kaa muqabla karne ke liye ekajute ho gaye hai
 But nothing can be said about Cauvery (irrigated Tamil Nadu)
 congress kii kismat kaa faisla 2014 main hoga
 But before that, elections to 10 Legislatures are going to be held in the next 18 months
 inamen gujarat, himachal pradesh, karnataka, rajasthan, madhya pradesh, dilli or chhattisgarh kii vidhansabhaayen shaamil hai
 Except for Delhi, the Congress has no charismatic local leader leading the election campaign
 congress ke saamne fori chunauti 12 june ko andhra pradesh main 18 vidhansabha siton ke liye hone vaale upachunaav hai
 The Congress is said to have lost hope there
 tikaton ke liye ummidavaaron main koi utsaah nahin he
 a senior minister in the state government, on the condition of anonymity, says, "it will be very difficult for us to win even half the seats
" '' unke aatmavishvaas kii kami ke peeche vajahen hai
 First, the Congress has a weak Chief Minister as Kiran Kumar Reddy
 aise main, divangat vaai
 s
 rajasekhar reddy ke bete or karishmai vidrohi jaganmohan reddy ne yuvakon ko lamaband kar unki sahanubhuti arjeet kar lee he
 The second reason is that the upa's attitude on the issue of separate Telangana state has been wavering
 sonia gandhi madhya april main kiran kumaar reddy se mili thim
 As it is said, the Congress President asked him to adopt a strict attitude and to build a good relationship with the media

 They are encouraging actor Chiranjeevi to sign his 150th film
 unhen ummid he ki congress ko abhinayta kii saakh kaa phayda milegaa
 But when Chiranjeevi merged his Praja Rajyam Party with the Congress in August 2011, he was hoping to play a bigger role in the Congress rather than the silver screen
 lekin is maukey par unke swaagat main yojit press conference khatm hone ke baad unhen kinare laga diya gaya
 If the rebellious leader of Karnataka BJP Yeddyurappa is reluctant to join hands with the Congress, this is one of the reasons
 duusari vajah he, 11 may ko chennai main chiranjeev kii beti sushmita ke ghar par iskar vibhaag kaa chapa padana
 "chiranjeevi was brought in to counter Jagan," a senior BJP leader told Yeddyurappa
 lekin dekhie, congress unke saath kis tarah kaa bartaav kar rahi he
 Despite this, Yeddyurappa's rebellion is a joy for the troubled Congress in Karnataka

 haalanki ek ore jahaan congress apni siton main ijaphe kii ummid kar rahi he, vahiin sabase ashaavadi netaa bhi rajya ko modi ke haathon se chhinane kii ummid nahin karte
 There is not good news from other states as well
 rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot apane 22 vidhayakon ke vidroh kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 13 of them had met Rahul Gandhi on April 3 in Delhi and said that the party would lose the 2013 assembly elections if Gehlot was not removed
 duusari baar vidhayak bane udailaal anjaan ne rahul se kaha, ''sthiti pehle se hi kharaab he, lekin hamane uttar pradesh ke chunaavon tak intjaar kiya
 We hope you do not want to lose Rajasthan either
 '' agar gahalot congress main apane aalochakon ko tarjeeh nahin dete hai to uski vajah yah he ki unhen bahujan samaaj party ke chah vidhayakon kaa samarthan hasil he
 These mlas joined the Congress after the 2008 elections along with six independents
 gahalot ne in sabhi 'bahari logon' ko party ke puraane netaaon kii keemat par mantri pad or anya suvidhaayen dekar khush rakhaa he
 But the Congress will have to pay its price
 bhavishyavaanee yah he ki agle chunaavon main rajya main party kaa safaya ho jayega
 According to a Congress general secretary, Sonia is planning to replace the chief ministers of Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan pad se hatane or centre main pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke mantrimandal main lautne ke icchhuk hai

 mukhyamantri pad ke duusare daavedaar vilasarav deshmukh or susheel kumaar scindia vibhinn ghotaale main aaropon kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 Unlike the BJP, which has several regional satraps like Narendra Modi to Raman Singh in Chhattisgarh, the Congress has only Tarun Gogoi in Assam, Sheila Dixit in Delhi and Bhupinder Singh Hooda in Haryana
 inamen se koi bhi netaa bade rajya par shashan nahin karata
 Sonia Gandhi feels insecure in increasing the satraps of the state as she does not want any challenge for Rahul
 nateeja yah ki majboot, kshetreey netaa kaa vichaar itihaas ban chukaa he (dekhen box)
 This reluctance to pursue a public leader was seen after the recent election results in Uttarakhand
 sonia gandhi ne mukhyamantri pad ke liye adhik lokapriy netaa harish ravat kii bajaae kamjor vijay bahuguna ko chunaa
 Some party leaders fear that they may do the same in Himachal Pradesh where the baseless Anand Sharma could be made the chief minister instead of four-time Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh if he wins the next elections

 Om Prakash Rajbhar said that in front of the upper caste ministers of the government, the officers move the tail, whereas the ministers belonging to the backward caste have no status

 Neither did any administrative officer of the district reach him
 mantri se milane unke vibhaag ke hi ek aadh afasar hi pahunche
 Annoyed by this system and the neglectful attitude of the officials, Minister Om Prakash shared his pain with the media workers and said that they come from Rajbhar caste which is a backward caste, and backward castes have been neglected for centuries
 wo mantri hai baavjood iske unhen guard of honor nahin diya gaya

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing a public meeting at Shantir Bazar in Tripura accused the Left and the Congress that both are two sides of the same coin which ruined the state
 congress bhrashtachar main maahir he to sipiem hinsa main paarangat he
 Modi made the state's working class happy, saying that if the BJP government comes to Tripura, the seventh pay commission will be implemented in the state
 2019 ke aam chunaav aayojan main hongi ye chaar badi chunautiyanunhone apane bhaashan kii shuruyaat karte hue kaha, 'main sabase pehle tripura ke maharaja rahe, unki mahaan parampara or mahaan kaam ko yaad karata hum

 But it has been 20-25 years, can any resident of Tripura say that priority is being given to development in the state? BJP leader said- Ban Ho Ho Priya Prakash's song, sell pakode is better than becoming a follower He said, 'left parties are afraid of their defeat in this election because they have attacked BJP workers
 unke paas koi jawaab nahin hoga ki beete 25 saalon main unhone kitne galat kaam kiye hai
 He further said, "when these leftist people kill innocents, then it is confirmed that they are shivering with defeat

 Taking a dig at the former Prime Minister at the rally, PM Modi said that if the former Prime Minister had more work, he could not come

 He targeted the former government and said that there is no shortage of money in this country

 ek aisi navjaat party jisane punjabi ilaake main tufaan laa diya tha or jisane 2014 main rajya kii chaar loksabhaa siton par vijay hasil kii thi, ab puri tarah se tut ke kagaar par he
 This is the story of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), that too in a state where it has carried forward its caravan with many promises, perhaps even more than its debut in Delhi in 2013
 gat 2 agast ko punjab main 'aap' ke 20 vidhayakon main se saat ne bathinda main kaaryakartaaon ke ek sammelan kii mejabani kii
 It was an open rebellion against the party's national convenor Arvind Kejriwal
 vaise to purv congressi or ab 'aap' ke pramukh netaa sukhpal khera is sammelan main 14 vidhayakon ko jutaney kaa apana vaada puraa nahin kar paae, lekin sammelan main juty baari bheed ne dilli ke mukhyamantri or unki party ke netaaon ko to pasinaa-pasinaa kar hi diya
 AAP volunteers and supporters, especially from south-west Malwa and central Doaba areas, gathered
 vastav main khera kaa to daawa he ki ''mutthi bhar dilli ke kripapaatr netaaon ke alaava baaki 95 fisadi party padaadhikari or netaa hamaare saath hai
 "the rebels have now declared" autonomy "of Punjab's AAP unit to such an extent that they will no longer seek any direction from Kejriwal or any Delhi leader
 samasya to pichley saal march main hue vidhansabha chunaav main party ke kharaab pradarshan se kaaphi pehle hi shuru ho gai thi
 In the beginning of 2016, most of the estimates and surveys (even of the Congress which won the election) believed that AAP would win 100 out of the 117 assembly seats in the state, but the party was just 20 seats were reduced
 tab bhi is baari giravat ke liye kejariwal ke nuksandeh galat anumaan ko jimmedaar mana gaya, jisase yah saaf ho gaya ki unako punjab ke bahusaanskrithik charitra kaa sahi andaja nahin he
 In the midst of a long campaign campaign (it started a year and a half before the March 2017 assembly elections), Delhi's leadership suddenly removed the party's Punjab convenor Sucha Singh Chhotepur
 un par yah aarope lagaaya gaya ki ve party main tikat dene ke liye paisa maang rah the
 a land-based leader who helped build the AAP in Punjab, its sudden exit became costly for the party, and organizationally, the party was almost halved
 iske baad kaaphi pareshaan karne vaale or sansanikhej aarope lagaae gaye ki 'dilli ke log' aam aadmi party ke punjab ke walantirs dwaara jutaaye gaye chande ko hathiyaa rahe hai or party daftar main duraachaar kar rahe hai
 Due to this, the loss increased
 lekin lagata he ki itnaa hi kaaphi nahin tha
 Encouraged by the support he received from Punjabi migrants, especially from Canada, Kejriwal made the huge mistake of publicizing a night-long campaign that he had allegedly stayed at the home of former Khalistan Commando Force militant Gurinder Singh
 iske baad rajya vidhansabha chunaav se teen din pehle hi bathinda ke mandi maur main hui aatanki bam visphot kii ghatana ne 'aap' kii kismat main or grahan laga diya
 It also added to the fact that Kejriwal had an 'association' with the Khalistanis
 is ghatana main saat log maare gaye the
 The truth is that the party's graph kept falling down after this
 gurudaspur loksabhaa upachunaav or shahkot vidhansabha upachunaav, donon main party ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In Shahkot, the bail of the 'AAP' candidate was forfeited and he got an embarrassing 1,900 votes
 punjab main aam aadmi party ne kai durbhagyapurna paristhitiyon kaa saamana kiya he, lekin maujuuda ghatnakram to party ke liye sabase buree aapadaa sabit ho sakati he
 Once again, he can be blamed for this, which Khaira and his supporters call 'kejriwal's dictatorial attitude'
 is baghawat ko tab hawa mili, jab dilli ke mukhyamantri kejariwal ne 26 july ko party ke vipaksh ke netaa pad par khera ko hataakar kisi or ko baitaane kaa faisla kiya
 The move was actually an attempt to establish former journalist and MLA Kanwar Sandhu in the state unit without any consultation
 or yah koi pehali baar nahin ho rahaa tharu pichley chah saal main 'aap' ke rajya sanyojak pad par chah logon kii tajposhi ho chuki he or pichley 16 maheene main vipaksh ke netaa ko bhi teen baar badla ja chukaa he
 Gurpreet Singh alias Ghuggi, who became the convener of the state after Chhotepur, was also removed without giving any reason
 to ab koi achraj kii baat nahin he ki mashhoor kamedian or actor ghuggi baagiyon ke saath ho gaye hai
 Kejriwal and his friends have kept their lips on this development, but Khaira and his supporters have expressed their intention to take over the party
 khera ne 5 agast ko kaha tha, ''aam aadmi party kaa nirmaan bade paimaane par logon ke yogadan se hua he, jinamein bharat or videsh main rahane vaale punjabiyon se milane vaala chanda shaamil he
 We will not leave it
 hamaara iraadaa yahaan (punjab main) party ko apane haath main lene kaa he
 Meanwhile, the party's confusion has increased
 party ke ab bhi vafaadaar bane rahe punjab ke netaa chaahate hai ki aktubar se pehle kejariwal, manish sisodiya or anya 'rashtriya netaa' punjab main ek raily karen
 But a party source says, "the problem is that Kejriwal is scared that he can do anything now; the general meeting of rebels in Bathinda is enough to put an eclipse on him
" '' baharhaal, punjab main jis party ke satta main aane ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe the, uskaa sabase bada netaa raily karne se hichak rahaa to daraar kii gaharaai kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he

 President Trump has taken this decision through Presidential Proclamation and has come into effect from November 1, 2018
 is faisle ke baad ab bharat ke liye america main in utpaadon kii supplai par duty lagaai jaaegi
 Now, instead of exporting these products in duty free category, India will have to export as Most Favored Nation (MFN) on which tax will be charged at a fixed rate
 gauratlab he ki america se dwipaksheeya kaarobaar main bharat ko bada phayda miltaa he or is phaayde ke chalate bharat apane kul vyapaar ghate ko kam kar letaa he
 Most of the products excluded from the duty free category are from the handloom and agriculture sector and for a long time the US had been tax-free, preferring the purchase of such products from the global market

 But after Trump's trade war with China, the US is now taking tough steps to reduce its trade deficit

 Over 6 billion dollars worth of products were supplied
 ab is faisle kaa sidhaa asar bharat-america dwipaksheeya kaarobaar ke aankadon par padegaa
 At the same time, most of the products in this category are from handloom and agriculture sector, India's small and medium industry will be affected

 On the other hand, the products which will now be taxed in India's exports mainly include Pigeon Peed Seed, Dry Fruits, Turpentine Gum, Mango, Vinegar, Sandstone and many chemicals
 iske saath hi bharat se badi maatra main niryaat ho rahe bhens ke chamade ko bhi duty free shrenee se baahar kar diya gaya he

 dilli vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh vijender gupta kii aguwai main bijepi vidhayakon kaa dal mangalvaar ko up rajyapal anil baijal se mulaakaat kii
 During this, Gupta demanded the removal of Kailash Gehlot, a minister in the Kejriwal government
 vidhansabha main anil baijal se mulaakaat ke dauraan kailash gahalot ke alaava vidhayak opi sharma or jagadish pradhan bhi maujuud rahe
 Leader of the Opposition Vijendra Guptane met Lt Governor Anil Baijal and accused the Delhi government of distorting the constitutional provisions and allowing Kailash Gehlot to continue as minister and allow him to attend the assembly session
 bijepi vidhayakon ne up rajyapal se aagrah kiya ki wo gahalot ko cabinet se hataane ke liye aavashyak kadam uthaaen or sunishchit karen ki wo sadan kii kaarywahi main hissaa na len
 Gupta alleged that Kailash Gehlot was made a minister on the basis that he was an MLA, but when his legislature was abolished, his continuation in the post of minister became unconstitutional
 unhone kaha ki gahalot kaa mantri pad par bane rahanaa gaiyr kanoonee he
 Therefore, he should have been removed from the post immediately, but CM Kejriwal did not do so
 bijepi netaa guptane bataaya ki dilli sarkaar adhinium 1991 ke niyam 43(bi) ke antargat vidhayak na rahete hue koi vyakti chah maheene tak mantri bana rah saktaa he, lekin niyam main yah kahin nahin likhaa he ki jis vidhayak kii sadsyta radd kar di gai ho, wo chah maheene tak mantri bana rah saktaa he
 BJP legislators said that it is unconstitutional for Kailash Gehlot to continue as a minister under the Indian Constitution and the Delhi Government Act 1991
 mulaakaat ke baad vijender gupta ne bataaya ki is masale par unhone raashtrapati ramnath kovind se bhi milane kaa vakt maanga he
 He said that at some stages of the journey of a country when legislative and executive units get away from their duties and goals under the constitution under the influence of populism, the judiciary should stand against these populist forces and protect constitutional values 
 kuch aalochakon ke liye yah sthiti aalochana kaa ek mauka de sakati he ki chune hue pratinidhiyon ke faisle ko kaise nyaayadhish palat sakate hai jabaki ve janata dwaara nirvaachit nahin hai
 He said that though we have to remember that such situations have put tremendous pressure on judicial units all over the world and it is no surprise that in some jurisdictions, the judiciary has also succumbed to populist forces
 yah ek aisa kshetra he jisamen nyaaypalika santhaan kii swatantraaa par aise loklubhaavan takaton ke hamalon kaa muqabla karne ke liye khud ko majboot kare or taiyaar kare
 Justice Gogoi said that independence is the soul of the judiciary and if it loses the confidence of the public, the decision it will give will not be 'justice'
 unhone kaha ki shashan kii raajnneetik pranali jo bhi ho vibhinn deshon main log chaahate hai ki unke liye ek swatantra or nishpaksh nyaayik pranali ho
 In fact, such aspirations are shared and connect different judicial systems of different countries
 unhone kaha ki gaiyr-raajnneetik niyuktiyaan, kaarykaal kii suraksha or pad se hataane kii kathor prakriya, nyaayadhishon ke liye vetan or pratishtha ko surakshit karnaa, aantarik javabdehi prakriya or nyaayadhishon ke liye aachaar samhita kaa karyanvayan kuch aise upaay hai jo nyaaypalika kii swatantraaa ko surakshit rakh sakate hai
 He said that the judicial system does not make friends and it cannot make friends because the job of the judiciary is not to make or break relationships

 com / dimj8bvtj5kohli ne tisare test kii purv sandhya par kaha ki yah ballebaajon ke liye behad mehtvapurn he ki ve jimmedaari len kyonki sabhi dekh sakate hai ki hamaare gendbaaj kaaphi acha pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Otherwise the bowler will not be able to do anything with the score we are making
 unhone kaha ki agar ham baad main ballebaaji karte hai to badhat banane yaa virdohi team ke score ke jitna adhik sambhav ho, utana adhik kareeb pahunchane kaa prayaas karte hai
 If you score too big then it becomes a second innings match and if you take a good lead in the first innings then you can take advantage of it

 com / wicakr9m9nkohali ne kaha ki ballebaajon ko samuhik prayaas karnaa hoga
 i personally would not say what one needs to do but as a batting unit we definitely have to do better
 bhartiya captain ne haalanki spasht kiya ki melbern test par unki adelaide test main jeet yaa perth test main haar kaa koi asar nahin padegaa
 He said that as a team i do not think that going 2–0, falling behind 0–2 or equalizing 1–1 has any effect on what is going to happen in the next two Tests
 nathan loyan ne ab tak do test main 16 wicket chatkaakar bhartiya ballebaajon ko kaaphi pareshaan kiya he or kohli ne is aaf spinner kii jamkar tarif kii
 He said that Lion is a very good bowler
 vah lagaataar achche kshetra main gendbaaji karata he
 We should have a plan against this type of bowler so that we can also find options to score runs because if he is allowed to bowl in one place for a long time then he will become more dangerous
 loyan kaa pradarshan isliye bhi vishesh he ki unhone apane adhikansh test match australia main khele
 He said that if a spinner bowls so well in Australia, it is a big deal
 ham ise chunauti ke rup main le rahe hai or nishchit taur par ham uske khilaaf apane khel main sudhaar karnaa chaahate hai
 We have worked hard during practice and now it matters who will be able to implement it on the field
 pichhali baar jab bharat emsiji par khelaa tha to vah test drow samaapt hua tha
 Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane scored centuries in that match
 kohli ne kaha ki pichhali baar kisi bhi team ke paksh main nateeja nahin aane main pich kii badi bhoomika thi
 But now looking at the pitch, it has a lot more grass than last time and i expect it to be a live pitch
 unhone kaha ki hamane pich dekhi or yah neeche se kaaphi sukhi lag rahi he
 There is a lot of grass on the pitch that will tie the surface

 Despite this, the 345th Vice Chancellor is the world's best-known researcher in medicine, who has played an important role in the discovery of cervical cancer vaccine
 isi vajah se ve aadhunik vigyaan ke kshetra main bharat ke saath cambridge ke sahyog badhaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 He says, "students of India have a lot of movement in Cambridge
 ab ham vichaaron ke pravaah, network sthapit karne or shaikshik prabhaav failaane ke bare main soch rahe hai
 ”this means participation in 250 active research projects between India and Cambridge
 ab jaraa bangaloru sthit institute for stem cell biology and regenrative medicine (inastem) main chemical biology or moulicular chikitsashastra ke kshetra main nai pahal par gaur kiijie
 The project will receive funds from the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) of the Government of India and under this, researchers will detect cellular irregularities that cause cancer and seek treatment for their prevention

 2001 main nite kii oopaadhi paane vaale is immunologist (rogrodhi kshamta visheshgy) kaa kahana he, ''yah hakeekat kaa pataa lagane kaa avasar he
 Food safety, water, energy, drug discovery, health care and life sciences are the core areas of partnership
 unka kahana he, ''cambridge in kshetron main kaaphi majboot he or ham bharat main aise sansthaanon kii talash kar rahe hai jinamein isaki poorak kshamta ho
 We want to keep both of us together
 ” lekin aisa sirf science or technology ke kshetra main hi nahin kiya jayega
 They say that future scientists cannot depend only on telling them about new technology
 unhen us disha main kaam karnaa hoga jahaan log technology kii kadra kar saken
 This is the biggest challenge for him
 ve kehete hai, ''or iske liye hamen samaaj ko samajhne kii jarurat he or yaheen humenities (manviki) kii ahmiyat najar aati he
 "it is no surprise that there is a lot of emphasis on research in Cambridge under Borisevich
 unka kahana he, ''meraa jehan ek cheez ke bare main hameshaa saaf tha ki mujhe research main janaa he
 "he did not get this inspiration from his parents who were immigrants from Poland and settled in Britain during the Second World War
 paanch saal kii umr tak boricevich angreji nahin bol pate the
 But his research interest was awakened when he joined the Welsh National School of Medicine in Cardiff
 unhone kaha, ''medical skool main pehle kuch varshon ne mujhe yah sochane par majaboor kar diya ki kitni chijen anjaani hai or kitni cheez jaanane kii jarurat he
 "but in a volatile career, he spent his time in both the hospital and the lab
 unka kahana he, ''vyaktigat taur par marijon kaa ilaaj karne se zyada santoshjanak koi anya kaam nahin he
 But you feel that if you knew a little more, you could have done a lot
 ”unke anusaar zyada logon kii madad karne ke liye shodh dirghakaalik nivesh he
 He has toured various countries from Europe to Africa, and has worked in diverse fields ranging from viral immunology to infectious diseases, cell immunity, virus-associated diseases and vaccine preparation
 unka kahana he, ''meri dilchaspee insaan ko prabhavit karne vaale ziddee virason main he, jisamen se 20 ham apane sharir main lekar chalate hai or kisi prakaar unke saath santulan barkaraar rakhte hai
 "he focused his attention on Human Papilloma Virus (HPV): how the immune system or disease-resistant ability protects against cervical cancer-causing viruses
 ve bataate hai, ''echpivi bahut vyapak infections he or har prakaar ke cervical cancer ke peeche 99 fisadi yahi hota he
 "he also says that" It spreads very slowly and if you get it at a young age then it ends automatically
 ”cardiff main ve jis samooh kaa netritv kar rahe the, usne is baat kaa pataa lagaana shuru kiya ki echpivi ke khud hi khatm hone kii kya vajah hoti he
 For this, the idea of making vaccines was fueled by the fact that cervical cancer can be avoided and that it is a major problem for many women, especially in developing countries
 2001 ke baad jab se boricevich landan ke imperial college ke medical skool ke adhyaksh bane tab se un par prashasnic jimmedaariyaan bad gayi
 He realized that the increasing preoccupation in higher education and science and the academic and scientific responsibilities of the college were such that he would not be able to do justice with the minor care of everyday medicine
 ve bataate hai, ''meraa focus badalakar duusare logon ko apana lakshya hasil karne main madad karnaa ho gaya or meraa kaam do sawaalon tak simit ho gaya: kya main protsaahit kar saktaa hum or kya main sahaayta kar saktaa hum yahi bhoomika ve cambridge vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati ke taur par aktubar, 2010 se nibhaa rahe hai
 And this is the work in which they enjoy the most
 kya ve bharat or cambridge ke bich koi nayaa adhyay shuru karenge? is uniwarsity kaa bhartiya chaatro se purana or athmiya rishta rahaa he jinamein bharat ke teen pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru, rajeev gandhi or manmohan singh shaamil hai
 Since the mid-19th century when a student from India was studying in Cambridge, the number has now reached 240
 unhone is baat kii ore ishaara karte hue kaha, ''ye log hamaare liye bahut mahatvapurn hai or hamaare samudaay ke behtareen sadsy hai
 But now the time has come to take the india-cambridge relationship to the next level
 ” boricevich kehete hai, ''ham sab ek duusare se bahut kuch sikh sakate hai kyonki ham sab vibhinn prakaar se samaadhaan dhundte hai

 Significantly, a few days ago, the recommendation to promote Justice Joseph as a judge of the apex court was sent back to the Collegium for reconsideration
 yadhyapi is bare main aadhikarik taur par kuch bhi nahin kaha gaya he, lekin sutron ne bataaya ki colegium main shaamil paanch nyaayadhishon ke sahamat hone par baithak kisi bhi samay ho sakati he
 It would be pertinent to mention here that Justice j Chelameswar, the most senior judge in the apex court, wrote a letter requesting the Chief Justice to call the collegium meeting on Thursday to send Justice Joseph's name to the Center without any delay

 dilli samet ensiaar main paraali jalaane se pradooshan str kaa badhanaa saamaanya baat he
 The issue was hot before the elections from Delhi to Haryana and Punjab
 lekin chunaav kii ghoshnaa ke baad ise kisi dal ne mudda nahin banaaya he
 Today's situation is such that stubble is being lit in Punjab and the level of air pollution in North India including Delhi has become very bad, but the issue is completely missing from the elections
 rajya partiyon se lekar rashtriya partiyon tak har koi is mudde par kuch bhi bolne se batch rahaa he
 Farmers in Punjab have also started burning straw
 baavjood iske punjab main iskaa koi shor nahin sunai de rahaa he
 In 2017, after Delhi's air pollution level reached its worst level, there was a demand for banning burning of straw in political corridors
 is bich dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne punjab or haryana se ise rokane kii apil kii thi
 Protesting Kejriwal's appeal, then AAP leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira burnt stubble in support of farmers in Ludhiana
 tab punjab ke mukhyamantri ne paraali jalaane ke liye centre sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha or is par ankush lagane main asamarthta jataai thi
 He had said that the farmers are already burdened with debt and they do not have the money to use stubble destroying equipment
 punjab or haryana main kisaanon kaa sabase zyada vot he or koi bhi party is mudde ko chune se dar rahi he kyonki is mudde ko uthaane kaa sidhaa asar vot par padegaa
 Talking to the English newspaper Indian Express, Punjab Agriculture Secretary Kahan Singh Pannu said, 'most of the officials who are responsible for stopping this are busy in elections
 ham kaise aadesh kaa paalan kar sakate hai
 Awareness campaign is going on and farmers are being informed about the loss due to straw
 'punjab or haryana main agar kheton main aag lagaai jaati he to vahaan na hi dilli kii tarah building hai, na hi vahaan itnaa construction chalata he, na hi vahaan pradooshan kaa str pehle se hi kharaab he
 These three things also put Delhi at risk because the downwind from Punjab, the air flowing south-east, actually passes through Delhi
 yani punjab kaa dhuaan udakar dilli aa jaataa he
 Delhi's air is equally heavy because there is more pollution here and after coming here the air stops because there are more dust particles in Delhi's air
 isse ek kohre jaisi parat banati he jo asal main koharaa nahin balki pradooshan hota he
 Sources said that the leaders have refused to take action against the farmers as no one wants to offend farmers during the election season
 fatehabad ke kisaan joginder ne bataaya ki paraali jalaana behad jaruri he
 We will not get a good crop unless we burn stubble
 sarkaar hamaari madad karne ke liye kabhi aage nahin aati
 Straw cutting machines are very expensive, which the farmer cannot afford
 punjab ke mukhyamantri amarinder singh ne un kisaanon ko muaavja dene ke liye kaha tha jo mashin yaa upkaran kharidne main asamarth hai
 The NGT has sought a status report from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh on the burning of stubble

 JDS chief spokesperson Danish Ali said 'aaj Tak' that our party is contesting against both Congress and BJP
 unhone kaha ki jedies rashtriya str par gaiyr bijepi or gaiyr congress kheme kii baat karti rahi he or deshbhar main donon rashtriya dalon se itar ek front taiyaar kar rahe hai
 Danish said the poll has always undermined the local party, but in the result the JDS is going to form the government with an absolute majority

 bahucharchit batla house encounter main saket court ne apana faisla sunaate hue is maamle ke mulzim shahzad ahamed ko mujrim qaraar diya or somvaar ko uski sazaa par bahes karne kii baat kahi
 With this decision, the debate over whether this encounter was fake or not, started fullstop
 yani yah saafe ho gaya ki batla house kaa encounter bilkul sahi tha
 "in view of all the evidence and witnesses, the court considers Shehzad Ahmed guilty under the terms of 302, 307, 353, 186, 333, 34 and the Arms Act against tazirat-e-hind and has now argued his sentence on Monday," the court said
 Will go
 'shahzad ke khilaaf daakhil chargeshit main dilli police ne use in dhaaraon ke alaava or bhi kai maamalon main gunahagaar bataate hue uske khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kii guzarish kii thi, jis par sunwaayee ke dauraan police ne kai saboot pesh kiye or daleel di, jabaki bachaav paksh ne unka virodh kiya
 But at last the court found him guilty of murdering Inspector Mohanchand Sharma, killing other policemen, attacking policemen with the intention of obstructing government work and under the Arms Act
 haalanki shahzad ke vakil or uske gharavaalon ne is faisale par nakhushi jataate hue is faisale ko hai court main chunauti dene kii baat kahi he
 Defending this encounter as fake, the defense says that it has been demanding a judicial inquiry into the matter from the beginning
 lekin sarkaar ne is par kabhi dhyaan nahin diya
 On the other hand, the family members of Shaheed Mohan Chandra Sharma expressed relief on this decision
 dilli main hue serial dhamaakon ke baad pichley 19 sitambar 2008 special cell ne batla house ilaake ke ek flats main aatankwaadiyon ko pakadaney ke liye dabish di thi
 During this encounter, Inspector Mohanchand Sharma was martyred, while some policemen were injured
 encounter main sajid or aatif naam ke do aatankwaadiyon kii maut ho gai thi, jabaki shahzad or junayd maukey se bhaag nikalne main kaamyaab rahaa tha
 Shehzad was later arrested by the police from Azamgarh, while Junaid has not yet been caught by the police

 Saket Court of Delhi has stamped this reality
 faisle se raahat dilli police ko bhi mili he, jo pichley 5 saalon se farji encounter ke shaq ke boj ke saath ji rahi thi
 Describing the encounter on September 19, 2008 in Batla House house number L18 as fake, the defense said that it has been demanding a judicial inquiry into the matter from the beginning
 ab intjaar 29 july kaa he, jis din shahzad kii sajaa par bahes hogi
 Who is terrorist Shahzad Ahmed? Shahzad is originally from Khalispur village in Azamgarh district of Uttar Pradesh
 shahzad aatanki sanghathan indian mujahidin kaa hissaa he, jisane 19 sitambar 2008 ko batla house encounter main inspector mohanchand sharma par goli chalaai thi
 After the encounter, Shahzad escaped from the spot along with the accused named Junaid, but the police had got the passport of Shahzad
 shahzad par police ne 5 lakh kaa inam ghoshit kiya tha or 1 farvari 2010 ko police ne use khalispur gaanv se giraftaar kar liya
 Shehzad is also accused of involvement in the Delhi serial blast of 13 September 2008
 haalanki dilli police ke saamne ek chunauti is baat ko sabit karne kii baaki he ki kya vaaki encounter ke din shahzad vahaan maujuud tha
 Now Shahzad's family is awaiting the verdict on the court's punishment after July 29, after which they will decide the future strategy
 azamgarh ke sanjarpur kaa dilli ke batla house ke el-18 se kya rishta he? aakhir sanjarpur ke paanch ladke gaanv se sidhe el-18 kaise pahunch gaye? aakhir kaise gaanv ke sidhe-sade ladke aatankwaadi ban baithe? shahzad ahamed urf pappu ke haath khun se range hue hai
 The court has now also stamped on this matter
 padhe-likhe shahzad ko adaalat ne dilli police ke jaanbaaj sipaahi mohan chand sharma kaa kaatil qaraar diya
 Shehzad alias Pappu belongs to Azamgarh and the police also arrested him from Azamgarh in the case of Batla House encounter
 police kii tafteesh kaa khulaasa bhi yahi he ki shahzad kaa taalluk us aatanki sanghathan indian mujahidin se he, jo hindustan ko mulk ke alag-alag hisson main tabaahi kii khaufnak tasviren dikhaa chukaa he
 Sanjarpur is a small village, with a population of only 15 thousand, but with a population of 15 thousand, this village appears to be the most different, the most different on the map of India
 jaanate hai kyon? kyonki jin 18 logon ko deshbhar main pichley kuch saalon main hue bam dhamaakon kaa jimmedaar tehraaya gaya, unamem se 16 ladke akele is ek gaanv ke hai
 Aaj Tak's team went there to know the truth of this village, just a week after the 13 September 2008 blasts in Delhi and the Batla House Encounter on 19 September 2008
 sanjarpur gaanv azamgarh shahar se kareeb tees kilomtirdur sarai mir se bilkul sata hua he
 This is the village with a population of about 15 thousand, which has suddenly started appearing different on the map of India for the last one week
 agar dilli or mumbai police ke daavon par yakeen karen, to haal ke saalon main deshbhar main jitne bhi dhamaake hue hai, un dhamaakon ko anjaam dene vaale zyaadaatar ladke isi ek akele gaanv ke hai
 Zeeshan, Sajid, Khalid, Saqib, Mohammad Sajid, Mohammad Sadiq Sheikh, Mohammad Arif Sheikh, Mohammad Zakir Sheikh, Mohammad Ansar Sheikh, Aftab Usmani
 
 
 in tamaam ladakon kaa pataa yahi sanjarpur gaanv he
 Atif, whom the police is describing as the boss of all these boys, also used to live in this Sanjarpur village earlier
 baad main uske gharavaale sarai mir ilaake main bas gaye
 The Abu Bashar, who is being described as the mastermind of the Gujarat blasts, is also from the same village Bina Para
 is gaanv ke najadik ilaake kaa sabase mashhoor he biisi inter college
 Except one Abu Bashar, all the remaining boys have completed their studies from this inter college
 kehete hai ki is college kaa rigelt ilaake ke baaki tamaam collejon se kahin zyada behatar hota he
 Now the question arises that after all how did so many boys of a prosperous and happy village go astray? So there are two pictures of this
 pehali khud gaanvvaalon kii, jo ye maanane ko taiyaar nahin he ki unke bachche aatankwaad ke raste par bhi ja sakate hai
 Ask around any of the parents of this village
 sab ek hi baat kehete hai ki unhone to apane bachche ko oonchi talim ke liye gaanv se shahar bheja tha
 But there is another aspect of the picture
 is gaanv ke jitne ladakon par dhamaakon main shaamil hone ke iljaam hai, wo sabhi kisi naa kisi rup main aatif se jude hai
 When Aajtak wandered the village, it was found out that Atif was the first young man from this village, who had come to Delhi for studies
 vah skool or inter college main in tamaam ladakon kaa senior tha
 It was only after Atif moved to Delhi that the other parents of the village also started sending their children to Delhi for studies
 dilli main in tamaam ladakon kaa ek hi madadgaar tha

 The same case is also in Delhi High Court where the final verdict has not come
 is bich 11 may ko dilli baar council ne disipi south se kaha ki tomars kii biessi kii degree, marksheet, elelbi profeshnal certificate, marksheet farzi lagati he
 Delhi Police sent their teams to Bhagalpur and Faizabad
 mangalvaar shaam ko dilli police ne apni press conference main jaanch report kii file patrakaron ko dikhaate hue kaha ki tomars ke dastauez farzi hai
 Investigations found that the roll number of his BSC degree of Awadh University was not found in the college and university records
 pariksha niyantrak ne bhi bataaya ki tomars ke naam par koi bhi degree yaa marksheet jari nahin kii gai he
 Also, the roll number written in LLB degree is the name of another student in front of that roll number in university records
 police ne kaha ki tilka maanjhi university ne ye tasadeeq kii he ki jo dastakhat proviginal certificate or tisare varsh kii marksheet par hai wo farzi hai
 Then the question arises whether there is also a marksheet of the first and second year
 is par metropolitan magistrate ke saamne police ne kaha ki biessi pratham varsh or dwitiya varsh kii marksheet par principal ke dastakhat hai
 The college superintendent said that they could not verify this
 isliye police is maamle main abhi jaanch karnaa chaahati he
 In the press conference, Delhi Police said that the arrest has been made as per the guidelines of the Supreme Court, but when the reporters asked questions, it was said that the subject of investigation is why they cannot answer on technical aspects
 raajnneetik rup se sawaal ho saktaa he ki dilli hai court main maamla chal rahaa he tab alag se jaanch kyon kii gai or giraftaar kyon kii gai
 The answer will be from the court itself, morality can only be debated

 Meanwhile, on May 11, Delhi Bar Council told DCP South that Tomar's bsc degree, marksheet, LLB professional certificate, marksheet appear to be fake
 dilli police ne apni timen bhagalpur or faizabad ke liye ravaanaa kar di
 On Tuesday evening, Delhi Police in its press conference, showing the file of the investigation report to journalists, said that Tomar's documents were fake
 jaanch main paaya gaya ki avadh university kii unki BSC kii degree kaa jo role number tha wo college or university ke record main nahin mila
 The Controller of Examinations also stated that no degree or marksheet has been issued in Tomar's name
 saath hi, elelbi kii degree main jo role number likhaa he, vishvavidhyalay ke record main us role number ke saamne kisi duusare chaatr kaa naam he
 Police said that Tilka Manjhi University has confirmed that the signed provisional certificate and the marksheet of the third year are fake
 tab sawaal uthta he ki kya pehle or duusare varsh kii marksheet bhi he
 On this, the police in front of the Metropolitan Magistrate said that the BSC first year and second year marksheets are signed by the principal
 college ke suparitendent ne kaha ki ve ise satyapit nahin kar sakate
 Therefore, the police want to investigate this matter right now
 press conference main dilli police ne kaha ki giraftaar supreme court kii guidelins ke mutabik kii gai he lekin jab patrakaron ne sawaal puche to kaha gaya ki jaanch kaa vishay he isliye takneekee pahaluon par jawaab nahin de sakate
 Politically, there may be a question as to why the case is going on in the Delhi High Court, why a separate investigation and arrest was made
 iskaa jawaab adaalat se hi milegaa, naitikta ke paimaane par bahes hi ho sakati he
 There was a long debate in front of the Metropolitan Magistrate of Saket

 sawaal galat poocha jayega to jawaab bhi galat milegaa
 But the police are saying that the signature of Tomar's deposited degree is forged
 jaj ne poocha bhi ki bahut tezi se karrwai hui he to police kaa jawaab tha ki hamane puri jaanch kii he
 Phoolka argued that how could it go to Bhagalpur and Awadh but did not go to the High Court where the matter is basically going on
 police ne apni daleel di ki hamaari jaanch main dastauez sahi nahin nikle hai
 Tomar's bail plea was rejected in court and remanded in police custody for four days
 swaraj abhiyaan ke yogendra yadav ne kaha he ki aam aadmi party ko tomars kii degree kii original copy saarvajanik kar deni chahie
 Yogendra and Prashant had demanded the Lokpal to investigate issues like Tomar while staying in the common man

 raajnneetik rup se sawaal ho saktaa he ki dilli hai court main maamla chal rahaa he tab alag se jaanch kyon kii gai or giraftaar kyon kii gai
 The answer will be from the court itself, morality can only be debated

 Delhi Police said they had to take Tomar to Bhagalpur for five days to investigate who else was involved in the conspiracy

 phulka ne bahes karte hue kaha ki tomars kaa role number 31518 he jabaki artiai main jaanboojh kar doosraa role number dekar poocha gaya tha ki kya yah tomars kaa number he
 If the question is asked incorrectly, the answer will also be wrong
 lekin police to kah rahi he ki tomars kii jamaa kii hui degree par dastakhat hi jaali hai
 The judge also asked that if action was taken very fast, then the police reply was that we have done a full investigation
 phulka ne daleel di ki aisa kaise ho saktaa he ki ye bhagalpur or avadh tak chale jaaen lekin hoicourt nahin gaye jahaan yah maamla mul rup se chal rahaa he
 The police argued that the documents did not come out in our investigation
 court main tomars kii zamaanat arzi khaarij ho gai or chaar dinon ke liye police hiraasat main bhej die gaye
 Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj Abhiyan has said that the Aam Aadmi Party should make the original copy of Tomar's degree public
 yogendra or prashanth ne aam aadmi main rahete hue tomars jaise masalon ko lokapal se jaanch karaane kii maang kii thi
 Arvind Kejriwal had said in a public reporter program in May that he had been sent to Bihar to get an original degree, but it was more than a month

 Both the Aam Aadmi Party and CPM connected the matter to Human Resource Minister Smriti Irani that they too had not given their degree information correctly in the affidavit

 Manish had written that whether the appointment of new Chief of ACB is being done due to the fear of opening the file of CNG scam

 There was a long debate in front of the Metropolitan Magistrate of Saket

 Fulka argued that Tomar's role number was 31518, while in RTI, it was deliberately given the second roll number whether it was Tomar's number
 sawaal galat poocha jayega to jawaab bhi galat milegaa
 But the police are saying that the signature of Tomar's deposited degree is forged
 jaj ne poocha bhi ki bahut tezi se karrwai hui he to police kaa jawaab tha ki hamane puri jaanch kii he
 Phoolka argued that how could it go to Bhagalpur and Awadh but did not go to the High Court where the matter is basically going on
 police ne apni daleel di ki hamaari jaanch main dastauez sahi nahin nikle hai
 Tomar's bail plea was rejected in court and remanded in police custody for four days

 Will the Aam Aadmi Party still defend Tomar? hoicourt main zamaanat ko chunauti di ja sakati he lekin kab tak sarkaar is maamle ko khinchegi
 Has Tomar become a weak link

 Should Tomar not resign immediately? mangalvaar dopaher teen baje arvind kejariwal bijli companiyon ke maamle kii jaanch ko lekar sieji se milane gaye
 Overall, a commentator has to be kept who will keep saying that this order of Delhi Government has come and the Lt
 Governor has canceled that order

 By the way, there is a lot of play between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh regarding ACB

 Questions are arising regarding the methods of Tomar's arrest
 kya up rajyapal, vidhansabha ke spikar yaa mukhyamantri ko pataa tha ki giraftaar ho rahi he
 But the question got way bigger
 kya ab bhi aam aadmi party tomars kaa bachaav karegi
 The bail can be challenged in the High Court, but by when will the government pull the case
 kya tomars kamazor kadi ban gaye hai
 If the degree is found to be fake, is it not a big moral defeat of the AAP government in this fight
 kya tomars kaa turant istipha nahin ho janaa chahie

 Prakash Namkeen's name is 'income Tax Mix Namkeen', sour-sweet Mixer named 'modi Mix', Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity is not hidden from anyone
 ab isi lokapriyata ko dhyaan main rakhte hue bhopal ke ek namakeen vyapaaree ne dukaan main modi namakeen bechnaa shuru kiya he
 'namkeen Namkeen' became the subject of discussion, a salty shop has become a topic of discussion these days in Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh
 new market ilaake kii ek namakeen dukaan main log ab piem modi ke naam kaa swaad bhi le sakenge, kyonki dhanteras par bhopal kii is dukaan main bik rahaa he 'modi namakeen'
 The shopkeeper named the sour-sweet namkeen as Modi mix and pungent namkeen as income tax mix
 namakeen kaa naam modi mix rakhane ke peeche dukandaar abhishek kaa tark he ki modi ke faisle kabhi khattey hote hai to kabhi namakeen isliye is baar unhone khattey-mithe mixchar ko 'modi mix' naam diya he
 According to Surgical strike-pak, this salty shopkeeper Abhishek said that the surgical strike was a sweet experience for the Indians but Pakistan's teeth became sour
 usee tarah notebandi ne hamen khatta anubhav diya, isliye aise khattey-mithe anubhav ke maddenjar hamane is namakeen ko modi mix naam diya he
 Similarly, people get sweat due to income tax, hence pungent snacks are called income tax
 abhishek ke mutabik agar modi namakeen ko safalataa milti he to wo duusare namakeen ke naam bhi modi ke naam par rakhenge Kumaon and Garhwal, both divisions of Uttarakhand, also received snowfall in places where snow had stopped falling in the last fifty years
 achaanak hui barfbaari se log hairaan hai
 The state government is inviting devotees from all over the country to visit all the four dhams of Uttarakhand even during the winter season, but the first snowfall exposed its arrangements
 barfbaari ke ek hafte baad bhi sabhi sheetakaaleen yatra padaavon par yatayaat ko saamaanya karnaa prashasan ke liye mumkin nahin ho paaya he
 The government wanted to start a winter trip from Yamunotri to Khursali on 14 December in Yamunotri, but it snowed on the same day
 mukhyamantri harish ravat ko bhi vahaan janaa tha lekin kharaab mausam ke kaaran ve vahaan pahunch nahin paae
 Tourism Minister Dinesh Dhanai and Urban Development Minister Pritam Singh reached Khirsali on this occasion
 lekin tirthayatriyon main zyaadaatar uttarakhand ke sameepvarti ilaakon ke the or koi bahari tirthayatri nahin tha
 State BJP leader Ajay Bhatt asks, "if this journey had gained momentum and it would have snowed in the middle, how could the government secure these pilgrims safely?" "the government is in a position to avoid sending its officers to areas in this regard, but what will the officers do without any arrangement?" Proposals sent by the administration of the districts through which the Chardham Winter Tour passes, have so far remained with the government
 jabaki mukhyamantri dilli main bhi press conference kar logon ko sheetakaaleen yatra par aane kaa aahvaan kar aae hai
 The condition now is that it is not in the power of the government staff to provide tourists even to Auli, which has been developed as a snowflake
 yahaan kaa asia kaa sabase bada ropave bhi kharabi ke chalate paryatakon ko auli nahin le ja paa rahaa he
 Administration is not able to give accurate information about the number of tourists stranded at all places

 This snowfall in remote rural areas is synonymous with disaster
 almoda, pithauragarh, bageshwar, champavat, chamoli, uttarkashi, rudraprayag samet sabhi jilon main baari barfbaari hui he
 The collapsing of 250 mobile towers and the loss of communication links make it a challenge to contact remote locations
 prabhavit jilon kii sadaken yatayaat ke liye kab tak khul paaengi, isaki thos jaankaree nahin mil paa rahi he
 The Chief Minister's assembly constituency Dharchula also craved for the restoration of essential services for several days

 The more the cold and the snow remains on the roots of trees, the more the output increases

 Lalit Tiwari, professor of botany at Kumaon University, says, "this snowfall will prove to be important for tenants
" ''kai gramin kshetron main rashan kii aapurti baadhit hone kii soochna par mukhyamantri ne jiladhikariyon ko is babat intjaam durust karne ke nirdesh jari kar unase report talab kii he
 "the Chief Minister has directed to burn bonfires, open roads and disaster teams have also been kept ready," says Surendra Kumar, media in-charge of the Chief Minister
 '' haalanki pradesh aapadaa parichaalan centre ke adhishasi nideshak dow
 Piyush Rautela argues that snow does not fall in the category of disaster
 aapadaa prabandhan or newnikaran centre ke paas barfbaari se nibatane or avaruddh sadakon se barf kaatane ke upkaran bhi maujuud nahin hai
 Nevertheless, snow on the roads is being removed from JCB
 kai jagahon par itane varshon baad barfbaari hui he ki prashasan usase nibatane kii takanic bhul chukaa tha
 According to Additional Chief Secretary Rakesh Sharma, the supply of electricity was disrupted due to the breaking of the lines due to falling of trees at many places, so the drinking water supply was also stalled

 During the trailer release, Shah Rukh Khan opened up about his favorite line of the film
 haalanki ye line trailor main shaamil nahin kii gai he
 Only in the event when King Khan was asked about the favorite line
 to unhone pehle movie ke lekhak or diarector se poocha, jab unki ijaajat mili tab apni fevorett line bataai
 That dialogue is - 'bring your own three khans, i am standing here my life'
 bete abram ke is riection par shahrukh khan ne feel kiya tha zeroakiri baar shahrukh ne kab feel kiya tha jiro?unhone kaha, ''main har baat par lujar feel karata hum
 One day when i asked Abram to sit together and he did not sit

 Then my wife explained to me

 Shah Rukh Khan said that it was not difficult for him to play a dwarf in Zero
 ve kehete hai, ''mere liye ye karactor aasaan tha
 But difficult for Anushka Sharma
 meri pareshaani VFX or cinemetography se aasaan ho gai thi
 i did Freedom Feel while doing the film
 ye film banani nahin thi jini thi
 This movie is the result of life
 ''zero Trailer: shahrukh hi nahin, anoushka bhi film kaa sikret packejakya he jiro ke trailor menye meerut ke rahane vaale baua singh thakur kii kahani he, jo 38 saal ke ho gaye hai, lekin bounepan ke kaaran unki shaadi ab tak nahin ho pai

 When it comes to cricket and patriotism, there is no match with the enthusiasm of Indian fans
 phir chaahe cricketron ko bhagwaan kii tarah poojana ho yaa phir sena ke samarthan main aa janaa
 But since Thursday, a controversy has arisen which has added respect to cricket and the army
 mahendra singh dhoni ke gloves par para military force ke balidaan baij ke nishaan ko ICC ne hataane kaa farmaan diya he
 Now people say that when the players can offer prayers in the field before the match, then what is wrong with the gloves? phens hai ki maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai or ise ab sena ke sammaan se jod diya he
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni is an honorary lieutenant colonel in the Territorial Army
 aise main unke paas aadhikarik taur par ye haq he ki vah is baij kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 So Dhoni, while showing respect, put a mark of sacrifice medal on his wicketkeeping gloves
 jab phens ko pataa chalaa to har koi dhoni kaa gungan karne laga
 But the International Cricket Council (ICC) did not like this
 ICC ne bisisiai ko likhakar apil kii he ki mahendra singh dhoni se apil kii jaae ki is gloves kaa istemaal na karen
 There has been a big debate on cricket world, social media
 soshal media par kuch log pakistani team kii tasviir saajha kar rahe hai, jisamen vah maidan par hi namaaz pard rahe hai
 In such a situation, people are questioning if a whole team can express their religious sentiments on the field, then what is the problem with just putting a badge on the gloves
 jabaki dhoni khud leftinent karnal hai
 The @ icchas no problem with the entire Pakistan cricket team marking territory by praying on the cricket field, denigrating Christians and people (part of Muslim ritual prayer) but find insignia on @ msdhoni's gloves inappropriate

 com / 8wwzytnti2— Tarek Fatah (@tarekfatah)june 6, 2019bataa den ki isse pehle ek baar jab afghanistan team kii bhi ek namaaj padhate hue tasviir saamne ai thi, jisapar kaaphi vivaad hua tha
 inzamam-ul-haq was then the coach of the Afghanistan team
 namaaj vaali baat ko na sirf phens, balki badi hastiyaan bhi uthaa rahi hai, pakistan ke hi tarik fateh ne bhi is par aapatti darj karai he
 At the same time, former captain of the Indian football team, Baichung Bhutia also says that there is no mistake in Dhoni's use of such a badge, but if the ICC has rules, then that too has to be seen
 bhartiya olympian susheel kumaar ne bhi kaha ki jabatak kisi ne koi shikaayat nahin kii hogi tabatak ye maamla saamne nahin aayaa hoga
 Pakistan ministers are also raising this issue
 unhone kaha ki isse kisi ko koi dikkat nahin honi chahie lekin niyamon ko bhi dekhnaa hoga
 Pakistani players offered Namaz many times on ground then never get objection from ICC
 
 But MS Dhoni can't wear army insignia gloves ?? can we call you as ICC - Islamic Cricket Council ?? # dhonikeeptheglovepic

 com / hxsdjizm8d — Sunil Rajput (@sunilrajputboy) June 7, 2019 In fact, the ICC rule says that no player can use something like that on their dress
 jisase koi dharmik, raajnneetik yaa nasleey sandesh jaae yaa phir kisi kii bhaawanaaon ko thes pahunche
 However, an argument is also being given that what can hurt anyone with the Army badge
 kaise rajasthan ke ek maamuli parivaar ke ladke par deraa pramukh kii najar padati he or phir uski duniya badalati chali jaati he
 Ram Rahim expanded the camp heavily after becoming the chief
 lekin rutaba badhane ke saath hi uske bheetar kuch aise aib bhi aate chale gaye jisane ek vaibhavshaalee shaks ko jail ke sikhchon ke peeche pahunchaa diya
 On this expansion of Ram Rahim's elusive world, all the interpretations of the principles of theology and economics are postponed, the scale of luxury and luxury are left stagnant
 or tuutati chali jaati hai aadhyatm main saadagi ke siddh sanskaar kii kundiyaan
 The gap between 7-year-old Gurmeet Singh and 49-year-old Baba Ram Rahim is not only 42 years old
 ek saadhaaran manushya ke aadambaron ke ulkapind main badal jane kaa bhi he
 On 31 March 1974, when Dera chief Shah Satnam Singh named Ram Rahim to seven-year-old Gurmeet Singh, he would not have guessed that his disciples would not pursue the tradition of simpleness of the camp
 will be known for
 ram rahim ne baabaaon ke bazaar main apni brandig aam aadmi ke baba ke taur par kii
 The camp in Sirsa was converted into a base where even a small number of people could face Baba while battling small difficulties
 
 Ram Rahim understood the caste class division of this market well and realized that there is no Baba for the women of Dalits, backward and lower classes in whose court he can get his head, then what was Baba's eye Embarked on market expansion
 ram rahim ne nasha mukti kaa vyapak abhiyaan shuru kiya
 a large number of poor men from haryana-punjab were victims of this
 nasha mukti abhiyaan ne mahilaon ko dere ke saath joda
 Widow marriage, women's education and dowry protest set Baba on a different ground
 dekhte hi dekhte ram rahim ne deraa sachche saude ko ashram kii tarah nahin company kii tarah chalaanaa shuru kiya
 It was tempted to record the record
 akhabaaron main chhapane kii lat lagi, tivi par cheharaa dikhaane kii bhukh badi
 This growing hunger created the illusion within Ram Rahim that Baba is not a brand
 dere kaa daawa he ki duniyabar main uske 5 karod se jyaaya anuyaayi hai
 Devotees are also in the US, Canada, England and Australia
 akele haryana main hi 25 lakh se zyada deraa samarthak hai
 The dera has assets of more than 5000 crores across India
 sirsa ke ashram main ek saath 1 lakh bhakt ruk sakate hai
 Ram Rahim saw business in this number as devotees increased
 ems ke naam se apni dawa company banaai
 Started business of flour-pulse-oil
 puja saamagree kaa dhandha badha, or isi ke saath badi ram rahim kii aarthik or siyaasi takat
 The head of the court began to visit Ram Rahim's court for votes
 ram rahim ke bare main aise-aise myth gadhe jane lage ki duusare baabaaon se muqabla hi na rahe, jaise baba rap sangeet ke master hai, baba geetkaar hai, baba shandaar singer hai, baba jabardast actor hai
 Baba is a wonderful director
 jaise-jaise ashram kii aamadani badi ram rahim kii ayyashi badi
 In religious life, a religious businessman used to ride a car worth 1
5 crores in private life
 baba kis car main savaar hai ye pataa na chale isliye aage-peeche kaale rang kii dedh-dedh karod kii paanch gaadiyaan chalati thim
 This Baba, who tied a Morpunkh in a bright turban, destroyed all the scales of luxury
 pakistan main mahilaon evam bacchon ke liye kaam karne vaale samooh ne apni report main kaha he ki karachi shahar main 2,317 bachche laapata ho gaye

 vaarshik report jari karte hue roshni helpline ke pramukh mohammad ali ne kaha, 'yadi 18 varsh se kam umr kaa koi baccha parivaar yaa abhibhavakon ke sampark main nahin rah jaataa to use laapata samaj liya jaataa he
 According to the Roshni helpline, it dealt with 476 missing child cases during the year 2012, but regrettable is that only 61 of these cases were reported as unacceptable crimes in police stations

 In fact, Priyanka Chopra recently arrived at a public event in Los Angeles, where she faced the anger of a Pakistani woman
 priyanka ne march main bhartiya army kii tarif karte hue twit kiya tha
 In this tweet, Priyanka wrote Jai Hind
 isi twit par naaraazgi jataate hue pakistani mahila ne priyanka ko hipokrate bataaya
 The woman said that with such a tweet, Priyanka Chopra is promoting nuclear war
 ye ghatana yues main beautycon event kii he
 Priyanka came here as a guest to talk
 audiyans main baithi pakistani mahila sawaal karne ke liye uthi or usne gusse main priyanka ko khari-khoti suna di
 Priyanka responded to this very calmly
 mahila ne chillaakar priyanka se kaha tha, 'aap shanti failaane ke liye united neshns gudwil ambesder hai or aap pakistan main newclear war karne ke liye logon ko uksaa rahi hai
 This cannot be done at all, as a Pakistani, millions of people like me have supported you in your business
 'isapar priyanka ne shant swabhaav main kaha, 'main sun rahi hum
 You make your point
 ' mahila kii baat puri hone par priyanka ne kaha, 'mere bahut se dost pakistani hai or main bharat se hum
 i do not like war but i am a patriot

 Now the woman who had shouted at Priyanka during the event, has also moved forward by tweeting
 mahila ne twit kar likhaa, 'main wo ladki hum jo priyanka chopra par chillaai thi
 It was difficult for me to listen to them when they were talking about 'loving their neighbors'
 ye salaah apane pradhanmantri ko do
 Both India and Pakistan were in danger
 iske baavjood unhone newclear war ke paksh main twit kiya tha
 'apart from this, the woman also tweeted more
 Hi, I’m the girl that “yelled” at Priyanka Chopra
 It was hard listening to her say, "we should be neighbors and love each other" - swing that advice over to your PM
 Both India and Pakistan were in danger
 And instead she tweeted out in favor for nuclear war
 — Ayesha Malik (@spishaa)august 11, 2019it took me back to when i couldn’t reach my family because of the blackouts and how scared / helpless i was
 She gaslit me and turned the narrative around on me being the "bad guy" - as a UN ambassador this was so irresponsible

 Some people are blaming Priyanka Chopra while others are standing with her
 jahaan kai kah rahe hai ki pakistani dost hone se kuch nahin hota to vahiin kuch priyanka kii baat kaa saport kar rahe hai
 Priyanka Chopra is incredibly condescending & arrogant: "girl, don't yell, don't embarrass yourself"
 Also, imagine responding with “I have Pakistani friends” after being asked about supporting war between the two nuclear powers

 Whatever ever
 kahin bhi
 May appear
 jaisaa dilli main jiviel narsimha kii press conference main hua
 But this 'shoe period' of Indian politics is not new
 isse pehle kai bhartiya netaaon par juuta atake ho chukaa he
 7 April 2009, shoe run on Finance Minister 26 April 2011, shoes on Suresh Kalmadi 7 October 2014, attack on Gadkari with shoes on 14 April 2016, shoe on Kanhaiya Kumar 01 January 2017, luck on shoes of Arvind Kejriwal on Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal Has been the worst
 in par ek nahin do do baar juute chal chuke hai
 Soot was also thrown and an auto driver slapped him
bjp spokesperson Narasimha Rao did not respond immediately after the juuta cond kii ghatana ke baad bijepi pravaktaa narsimha raav ne tunrat koi pratikriya nahin di
 He continued his talk
 is ghatana par bijepi pravaktaa nalin kohli ne kaha ki jis bhi shaks ne yah kiya or agar kisi ke kehane par kiya he to yah behad dukhad he
 This is indecent behavior and there is no place for it in democracy
 vahiin bijepi ne is ghatana kii ninda karte hue kaha ki yah bahut dukhad or nindaneey he
 From George Bush to Musharraf
 chidambaram se lekar arvind kejariwal tak or to or purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh tak par ye juuta apni takat kaa pradarshan kar chukaa he
 In the world, even though footwear incidents are counted
 magar hindustan kii raajnneeti main jab se juuta kaal aayaa he tab se jahaan dekho juute hi baras rahe hai
 If this shoe just continues to show its strength, then the day is not far when the leaders will have to hold a press conference either in religious places
 yaa wo apane aage mike ke alaava adamkad ke shishe bhi lagava lenge
 Many big leaders do their stage when they are public rally, about 200 meters from the public
 taaki un tak isaki aamad mumkin naa ho sake
 This one shoe walked on BJP leader GVL, at the press conference
 balki puure bijepi daftar kaa maahaul hi badal kar rakh diya
 People engaged in gvl's protection broke down on the shoe-throwing accused
 magar wo apana kaam kar chukaa tha
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh targeted the Narendra Modi government

 The former PM said that some trends have become such that there is increasing intolerance, communal polarization and violence

 At the same time, the mob is taking law in their hands, which is hurting our politics
 manmohan singh ne kaha ki in sab chizon se shanti, rashtriya ekta or sampradayik sauhaard par asar padataa he, jo hamaare samvidhan ke mul tatv hai
 We have to see how we can cooperate in arresting those who spread hatred
 manmohan singh ne kaha ki bharat avibhajya he or dharmanirpekshata hamaare rashtrawaad kaa aadhaar he
 No religion teaches hate or intolerance
 bahari or aantarik donon nihit swaarth bharat ko vibhajit karne ke liye sampradayik junun or hinsa ko uksaa rahe hai or unka shoshan kar rahe hai
 Earlier, Manmohan Singh visited Vir Bhumi and paid tribute to former PM Rajiv Gandhi

 Fatima has come up against Congress's Arif Akeel to avenge his father's defeat
 fatima congress ke purv vidhayak rasul ahamed siddiki kii beti hai
 Rasul Ahmed Siddiqui has been a Congress MLA from Bhopal North seat twice in the 90s
 1992 ke vidhansabha chunaav main janata dal ke ummidavaar ke taur par aarif akil ne congress ke rasul ahamed siddiki ko maat dekar is seat par kabja jamaaya tha
 However, Arif Akil later joined the Congress
 iske baad se akil lagaataar paanch baar se chunaav jitate aa rahe hai
 Reaching the assembly as the only Muslim MLA in Madhya Pradesh for the last three assembly elections

 Fatima is seeking votes in the north seat of Bhopal in her father's name
 muslimon ke saath-saath bijepi ke paramparaagat vot kii ummid lagaae hai
 But it is not so easy to beat Arif Akli
 aarif ne bhopal main 1984 main union carbide gas li haadase ke baad logon ke bich gahari paith banane main kaamyaab rahe the
 He settled an Arif Nagar at some distance from the factory
 is jagah par gas traasadee ke peedit or unke pariwaron ko basaaya gaya
 While a minister in the Congress government, Arif Akil also worked hard to provide compensation to the people affected in the gas tragedy
 bhopal uttar seat par kareeb 54 fisadi muslim vot hai, lekin sindhi samaaj ke voter bhi achche khaase hai
 At the same time, Fatima's face as a BJP candidate from Bhopal North seat is new to the people of the region
 aise main wo apana parichay pita ke jariye de rahi he, lekin unke pita ke vidhayak rahe hue kaaphi samay ho gaye hai
 Younger generations are new
 bijepi ne fatima ko yahaan se ain vakt par tikat dekar har kisi ko hairaan kar diya tha
 This decision of the party has disappointed many claimant leaders of BJP
 haalanki is seat par matadaata abhi khulkar bolne ko taiyaar nahin he
 Arif Aqeel won the 2013 assembly elections by just 6 thousand votes
 bijepi ne tab bhi unke saamne muslim chehre ke taur par aarif beg ko utaara tha, lekin wo aarif akil ko maat nahin de sake hai

 ajit kumaar bataate hai, ''pichhadi jatiyon main sabase adhik phayda inamen sankhyabal main sabase badi yadav jati ko hi hua he
 As the assembly elections close, non-yadav castes are gathering backwardness as an issue
 isse pichhadi raajnneeti main sidhaa vibhaajan saaf dikhne laga he
 The non-yadav backward castes have an eye on the vote bank
 Among the non-yadav backward castes, Kurmi, apart from Kurmi, have similar social structure like Saini, Shakya, Kushwaha and Maurya
 pichhadi jatiyon main inaki sammilit hissedari 14 fisadi se kuch zyada he
 According to political analysts, the Kurmi fraternity accounts for more than 15% of the total population in 17 districts of Purvanchal and Bundelkhand, including Varanasi, Kanpur, Lakhimpur Kheri, Farrukhabad
 vahiin saharanpur, mujffarnagar samet aasapaas ke jilon main saini, pratapgarh, elahabaad, devaria, kushinagar jaise jilon main maury birdari kii acchhee-khaasi taadaad he
 This is the reason why non-yadav backward castes are gathering under the leadership of peasant castes like Kurmi and Maurya
 in jatiyon ke voton par kabje kii jang main vibhinn partiyon ne alag-alag hisse main apane suurama utaar die hai
 After the formation of the BJP government in maurya-kurmi Golbandikendra, the party had given responsibility to half a dozen Kurmi leaders in UP to focus on a large section of backward castes
 pichhadi jatiyon main sapa sarkaar kii yadavaparasti ke khilaaf punap rahe asantosh ko bhunaane ke liye april main keshav prasad maury ko upi bijepi kii kaman saunp di gai
 On 30 May, through the 'sardar Patel Virat Kisan Sammelan' at Andawa Charahe in Allahabad, BJP National President Amit Shah initiated mobilization among Kurmi voters

 After this, the party put UP in-charge Om Prakash Mathur on a mission to merge his party
 isamen safalataa milane ke baad bijepi purvanchal main nitish kumaar kii badhati sakriyata se nibatane ke liye anupriya ko sakriy karne kaa tanabana bun chuki he
 a BJP MLA in Varanasi is also in touch with Krishna Patel, another faction of the Apna Dal, to bring them into the saffron camp in future

 ve elahabaad main bijepi rashtriya kaarysmiti ke dauraan om maathur samet kai netaaon ke sampark main aae the
 After the formation of SP government in non-yadav equilibrium, the Mulayam Yadav was angered by the backward castes giving more importance to government jobs and development schemes
 iskaa laabh uthaane se vipakshi partiyon ko rokane ke liye sapa mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav ne akbarpur ke vidhayak or kurmi netaa ramamurti verma ko pehle rajyamantri or phir cabinet mantri banaaya
 By the way, all his strategy went into the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 iske baad hi mulaayam ne sapa ke pradesh prabharee shivpal yadav ko kabhi purvanchal main bade kurmi netaa rahe apane puraane saathi benny prasad verma ko waapas laane kaa jikvama saunpa
 When he came to SP, Mulayam sent him to Rajya Sabha
 sapa ne bhi badali ranneetikurmi matadaataaon ko saadhane ke liye sapabeniko rashtriya kaaryakarini main jagah dekar purvanchal ke kai jilon kaa prabharee banane kii taiyaari main he
 The party has tried to contain the discontent created against the Yadav caste among the most backward castes by making Sahab Singh Saini a cabinet minister, Lilavati Kushwaha of Faizabad as a Legislative Council member among other castes equivalent to Maurya
 bispi main bhi daliton khaskar jatav jati par jarurat se zyada kendrit ho jane se pichde netaaon main asantosh failaa he
 There is a vacuum in the party after Maurya leaves
 kurmi netaa lalji verma bispi sarkaar main prabhavi mantri the par pichley do varshon se haashie par hai
 By the way, the BSP MLA is trying to make up for the loss of the backward castes due to the departure of BSP Maurya by forwarding the Kurmi leader Ram Prasad Chaudhary
 kurmi swabhimaan ke jariye paithnithish kumaar ne upi main siyaasi kadam rakhte hue apni chhavi ek prabhavi kurmi netaa kii banane kii koshish kii he
 In his rallies, activists arouse the feelings of Kurmi Swabhiman by calling him a contender for the post of PM in the next Lok Sabha election
 nitish ne gajipur, mirzapur, lakhanu, varanasi ke pindra jaise jagahon par reliyaan kii hai jahaan kurmi log acchhee sankhya main hai
 Reversing the BJP, Nitish refers to former BJP state president and Kurmi leader Om Prakash Singh
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bijepi ne unhen ahmedabad main banane vaali sardaar patel kii pratimaa ke liye loha sangrahan samiti kaa pradesh prabharee banaaya tha
 For this Kurmi leader who was sent marginalized after the Lok Sabha elections, on June 18, Nitish said at a rally in Chunar (mirzapur), "don't know where Om Prakash Singh has been sidelined these days
 ''nitish kii katunke zikr se nitish bijepi par kurmiyon kii upeksha karne kaa aarope lagaate hai
 Accused of cheating in the Bihar elections, they are also trying to make a dent in the backward vote bank of SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav
 unhone sharad yadav ko swami prasad maury se samarthan paane ke liye bhi lagaaya he to nitish apana dal ke duusare dhade kii adhyaksh krishna patel ko bhi apane saath jodakar kurmi maton par ecchhatra daavedaari kii koshish main hai

 Late on Tuesday, October 1, the national general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav, quoting SP national president Mulayam Singh Yadav, issued an order and dismissed Kushwaha from the post of national general secretary
