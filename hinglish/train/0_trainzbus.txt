 The Supreme Court reduced the death sentence of Khalistani terrorist Devendra Pal Singh Bhullar to life imprisonment
 bhullar 1993 main dilli main hue bam visphot kaa doshi he
 The blast was carried out outside the Youth Congress office in Delhi and MS Bitta, the then president of the Youth Congress, was the target
 is dhamaake main 9 logon kii maut ho gayi thi jabaki congress netaa emes bitta jakhmi ho gaye the
 On 26 March 2002, the Supreme Court upheld Bhullar's death sentence, dismissing his appeal
 court ne bhullar kii punarvichaar yachika 17 disambar, 2002 ko or phir 12 march, 2003 ko uski sudharatmak yachika bhi khaarij kar di thi
 Bhullar then filed a mercy petition with the President on 14 January 2003
 raashtrapati ne aath saal baad pichley saal 25 may ko uski dayaa yachika khaarij kar di thi
 An application was again made in the Supreme Court on behalf of Bhullar's family, in which it was said that his mental condition is not good
 saath hi isamen yah bhi kaha gaya ki uski dayaa yachika par nirnay lene main aath saal kaa vakt laga he
 On 31 January, the court had stayed the execution of Bhullar and agreed to reconsider its decision under which the appeal for commutation of his death sentence to life imprisonment was rejected in the 1993 Delhi bombings case
 court ne is maamle main kendra or dilli sarkaar ko notice jari karne ke saath hi ihabaas (institute of human bihaviour and ellide sciensej) santhaan se bhullar ke swasthya ke bare main report maangi thi
 Initially, the central government opposed it but the central government had informed the Supreme Court three days in advance that it had no problem with Bhullar's death sentence being commuted to life imprisonment

 The bonding of the three is also very good
 shridevi aksar soshal media par apni betiyon ke sang tasviren share karti rahati hai
 On the one hand, while Jahnavi is soon to make her Bollywood debut, not much is known about Khushi's career choice
 shridevi kaa ek or fishan blendar, bedshit se ho rahi unki dress kii tulanashridevi ne khushi ko lekar ek baar kaha tha ki mujhe khushi ke actor banane se nahin, balki shaadi karne se zyada khushi hogi
 He was being trolled on his statement, after which he offered a clarification

 When he was asked about the crime happening with girls across the country, he said- 'I have a lot of tension when my daughters go out late at night

 Recently, there was news that this time Ranbir Kapoor will replace Amitabh Bachchan, but if the latest news is to be believed, Amitabh Bachchan's daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai Bachchan or Madhuri Dixit can become the host of 'KBC' this time
 'kebisi' kaa antim sijan 2014 main aayaa tha or ab sho ke mekars phir se nayaa sijan laana chaahate hai, jo prime time par prasaarit hoga

 The matter was raised by the Congress on the very first day of the winter session of Parliament
 iske baad congress lagaataar ise lekar sarkaar kaa virodh kar rahi he
 Meanwhile, there are reports that the government may also introduce the SPG Amendment Bill in the current session of Parliament
 SPG sanshodhan vidheyak se judi jaankaree ke mutabik yah vidheyak espiji suraksha ko keval pradhanmantri tak simit rakhane par kendrit hoga
 Explain that on withdrawal of SPG protection from Gandhi family, Congress had tried to surround the Modi government on the very first day of the session and created a lot of uproar
 sarkaar boli isamen kuch bhi raajnneetik nahiloksabhaa main congress kii ore se is masale ko joardaar tareeke se uthaaya gaya
 Congress mps allege that the government is acting with a sense of revenge
 vahiin sarkaar kii ore se yah kaha gaya he ki isamen kuch bhi raajnneetik nahin he
 On the second day, during the zero hour on the second day of the Congress session, the Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary raised the issue of removing SPG security of Gandhi family
 asana ne is vishay se bhi inkaar kar diya
 He said that bring the subject as per the rule
 iske baad hangaame ke bich gandhi parivaar kii espiji suraksha hataae jane ke mudde ko lekar congress ke saansadon ne loksabhaa se walk out bhi kar liya tha
 Anand Sharma raised the issue in Rajya Sabha On the third day of the winter session, the same issue was raised by Anand Sharma in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday
 anand sharma ne kaha ki hamaari sarkaar se guzarish he ki hamaare netaaon kii suraksha raajnneeti se alag rakhen
 Subramanian Swamy, while replying to Anand Sharma, said that the Ministry of Home Affairs constantly assesses the danger
 yah usee aadhaar par hua
 The security of many leaders was also reduced during the UPA government
 vahiin is maamle par bolte hue je pi nadda kaha ki isamen kuch bhi raajnneetik nahin he
 Security is not removed
 grih mantralay ke paas ek niyamavali he or protocol he
 This has not been done by any politician but by the Ministry of Home Affairs
 upi ke saifai mahotsav main shirkat karne ke baad salmaan khan lagaataar aalochanaon main ghirte chale ja rahe hai
 However Salman Khan feels that he did nothing wrong by performing there
 aise mudde oochhaalane ke liye unhone media ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 Salman Khan spoke to 'headlines Today' on this issue and answered many questions in his own style
 pesh hai kuch sawaal or salmaan ke jawaab
 
 
 Question: Salman, i do not remember when you had presented an explanation on such an issue earlier
 aapke fasebuk pej par is baat par safai di gai he ki aapane saifai main shirkat kyon kii
 Why did you feel that this issue should be clarified? Answer: Let me tell you
 media ko isamen manoranjan ke saath-saath 'masaale' kii jarurat thi
 When it included names of stars like Salman Khan, Madhuri Dixit, Varun Dhawan, Alia Bhatt, the media could have made a 1-hour program on it, which would have had four 'breaks'
 sawaal:kya aapako sachmuch aisa lagata he ki 'bijness' ke chalate aisa hua?jawaab:to ye or kya he? ham vahaan jis tarah ke sho ke liye gaye the, vaise hi sho ham anya jagahon par bhi karte hai
 We went there for a show, not for any special party
 yah uchit nahin he ki maadhuri dikshit ke dance ke shot ke saath kuch garib bacchon ko jodakar dikhaaya jaae
 If i perform in Andheri Sports Complex, why don't you show it by linking it to Mumbai and the poverty around it? After all, why in UP? Question: If you are asking a question, let me answer
 
 
 jawaab:mujhe kehane dijie
 Every actor performing there has donated money to charity in Saifai, so if i earn a rupee and donate it to charity, you should be happy with it
 sawaal:koi nahin kah rahaa he ki keval aap logon kii hi galati he
 We are also criticizing the government which called you people
 jawaab:lekin isse ham kalakaaron kii chhavi kharaab hui
 
 
 And Akhilesh is the CM whom people have chosen
 mujhe vahaan jaakar kuch aadar kaa bhav dikhaanaa tha
 Question: When Akhilesh appeared, he blamed the media for this
 
 
 jawaab:mujhe nahin pataa, unhone kya kaha
 i am talking about artists
 hamamen se koi bhi vahaan kisi ke dil ko chot pahunchane nahin gaya tha
 We went because someone called us
 hamane apana kaam kiya or waapas aa gaye
 Question: Salman, you think so because you were part of that group
 aap sari chizon ko ek saath dekhie, phir dekhie ki yah kaisaa lagata he
 Only then you will be able to understand what we mean
 
 
 jawaab:aapane mujhase saifai ke bare main kuch sawaal puche hai, jinke jawaab maine de die hai
 Now ask further sawaal:kya vajah he ki aapako fasebuk par safai post karne kii jarurat pad gai?jawaab:haa, isliye ki news media is bare main kreji ho rahaa tha
 You are trying to change the mood of na√Øve audience by simultaneously showing the dance of the actors and shots of the needy
 bulaane par ham vahaan gaye, phir waapas aa gaye
 Question: Are you loyal to Priya Dutt? Answer: Yes, because i have known her since she was a child
 main unki manshaa se waakif hum
 She is working for people, i have seen this
 main unka samarthan karuunga
 In the interim budget, the Modi government has given a big relief to those who buy a new house
 vahiin agar koi apana ek ghar bechakar us amount se do ghar bhi kharidta he to use capital gen tex ab nahin dena padegaa
 Previously only one could buy a house
 centre sarkaar ke is kadam se bade shaharon main rahane vaale logon ko laabh milane vaala he
 In a way, in the interim budget, Piyush Goyal has announced three big reliefs on house property
 pehali raahjhagar kisi se apana ghar kiraaye par de rakhaa he to use badi raahat milane vaali he
 Now the TDS deduction limit on rental income has been increased
 pehle salanaa 1 lakh 80 hajaar rupee tak kiraaye par TDS nahin dena padataa tha, isse upar kii rakam par TDS kii katautee hoti thi
 But now this amount has been increased to 2 lakh 40 thousand rupees
 yani 2,40,000 rupee tak ke kiraaye par ab koi TDS nahin dena hoga
 Second relief: If someone has more than one house ie two houses, one of them had to pay tax
 kyonki iskar vibhaag ko lagata tha ki do ghar main se ek ghar ko kiraye par lagaaya gaya hoga, or usase hone vaali aamadani par tex vasula jaataa tha
 But now Piyush Goyal has announced that due to children's education, jobs and parents, many people have homes in two cities
 ab aise logon ko badi raahat mili he jinke paas apane do ghar hai, unhen ab donon gharon ke byaaj par tex chhot milegi
 Giving examples in the Lok Sabha, Piyush Goyal said that people in metros like Mumbai sell their old house and take two houses for their children in the surrounding areas
 lekin unhen isamen kar se raahat nahin milti thi, aisi hi sthiti dilli, kolkata or chennai jaise mahanagaron main bhi he
 However, he said that people in all cities will benefit from this scheme
 teesri rahatpiyush goyal ne 2 karod rupee tak ke puunjigat laabhon ko praapt karne vaale ek karadaata ke ek awasaiya ghar se duusare awasaiya ghar main nivesh ke liye iskar adhinium kii dhara 54 ke antargat puunjigat laabhon main vruddhi kaa prastaav kiya he
 That is, if someone now sells one house and buys two houses for the same amount, then there will be no need to pay long term capital gains tax
 isse ab bade shaharon main makaanon kii bikri bad sakati he
 Till now, the rule used to say that if one buys one house and buys another house, then the long term capital gains tax will not apply to it, but on buying two houses, the second house was covered by tax
 yani duusare par long turm capital gen tex dena padataa tha
 Now people will be able to take two houses easily with the new rule
 yani ki ab kisi paas do property he to donon par capital gen tex chhot kaa phayda milegaa
 Apart from this, through the interim budget, the Modi government has given tax exemption to the builders on unsold houses, they will not have to pay any tax on the unsold houses for 2 years
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main aam aadmi party ke mukhiya arvind kejariwal kaa josh itnaa hai tha ki wo varanasi jaakar narendra modi ke khilaaf chunaav lard gaye
 However, he lost the election but the people of Delhi were not disenchanted with the AAP and gave him unexpected support in the 2015 assembly elections
 magar, modi lahar (2014) main dilli kaa sammanjanak samarthan paane vaali aap ko modi tsunami (2019) main janata ne puri tarah se nakaar diya
 Party MLA Alka Lamba expressed her opinion on how the AAP, which ruled Delhi's hearts, fell to its fate
 Aajtak
 In a special conversation with in Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Chandni Chowk, Alka Lamba said that as the results have come all over the country, in that situation the defeat of any one was certain, but such bad results could have saved the AAP
 lamba ne kaha ki 2014 ke chunaav main duusare number par rahane vaali party, jisane 2015 main dilli main sarkaar banaai wo kam se kam maujuuda chunaav main duusari pojishan par to aa hi sakati thi, lekin haalat ye hai ki pratyaashee jamaanat bhi nahin bachaa paae
 Alka Lamba gave many reasons for this defeat of AAP due to the defeat reported by Alka Lamba
 unhone bataaya ki party ne jitne bhi pratyaashee utaare wo anjaan the
 These were such candidates, who had a lot of publicity time to introduce themselves
 lamba ne kaha ki aap ke pratyaashiyon main se kuch jarur media main pahchaan rakhte hai, lekin janata ke bich unki koi pakad nahin he
 Stating this reason, Alka Lamba also claimed that the ticket distribution was not democratic
 unhone kaha ki tikat dete vakt kisi vidhayak se nahin poocha gaya or band kamaron se hi saare faisle ho gaye
 Alka says that if any of the sitting mlas were given tickets, the results would have been different
 mahagathbandhan ke saath jane par bigadi chhavialka lamba ne modi ke khilaaf kai manchon par ekajute hue vipakshi netaaon ke saath arvind kejariwal kaa janaa bhi haar kaa ek ahm kaaran bataaya
 He said that going with the grand alliance deteriorated the image of the Aam Aadmi Party, but even more harmful was to bow to the Congress in Delhi
 lamba ne kaha ki congress se gathbandhan ke aise prayaas se party kii kamajori dikhi or janata ke bich yah sandesh gaya ki aap kisi ko haraa nahin paa rahi he
 Alka Lamba, while saying this, also gave the example of Naveen Patnaik, president of Biju Janata Dal, the regional party of Odisha
 unhone kaha ki naveen patnayak kahin bhi mahagathbandhan ke saath khadey najar nahin aae
 That is why today they got better results
 alka lamba ne kaha ki kejariwal mahagathbandhan se dur rahete to aaj halaat kuch or hote
 Bringing back the vote is a big challenge from Alka Lamba
 in ne jab yah sawaal poocha ki kya agle saal hone ja dilli vidhansabha chunaav ko bhi loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey prabhavit karenge to unhone kaha ki ab AAP ke liye apana vot waapas laana badi chunauti he
 Alka Lamba said that the 2015 election was a change after the Anna movement, but today that image is over and now only the Mohalla clinics cannot get votes
 alka ne aap ko kamjor sthiti main bataate hue congress kii haalat main sudhaar kii baat kahi
 He said that Congress stands ahead in terms of vote percentage and aap's condition is worse than 2014
 yahaan tak ki kejariwal or manish sisodiya kii vidhansabha main bhi party ko bahut kam vot mila he
 Criticizing Kejriwal's not getting Muslim votes, Alka said that not only Muslims but all the society have rejected AAP in this election
 ye tamaam vajah ginate hue alka lamba ne daawa kiya ki aise paristhitiyon main vidhansabha kii ladaai trikoniya najar nahin aa rahi he
 Also, Alka Lamba also said that for five years the Modi government has been accused of not allowing it to work, so now that the Modi government has come again, what is the guarantee that they will let it work again
 apni is baat ko samajhaate hue alka lamba ne dilli bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari or congress adhyaksh shila dikshit kii mulaakaat kaa bhi zikr kiya
 Alka Lamba said that it was not just a courtesy meeting, but a message that if Kejriwal stays in Delhi, nothing will happen
 sanjay singh ke saath alka lambakejariwal den party sanyojak pad se istifaam aadmi party kii haar kaa kaaran arvind kejariwal ko bataate hue alka lamba ne unase party sanyojak pad se istipha dene kii bhi maang kii
 Alka said that along with Kejriwal being the Chief Minister, he is also handling the work of the party, in such a situation, now someone should get the responsibility of the party, who does not have the burden of governance
 alka lamba ne iske liye rajyasabha saansad or party ke varisht netaa sanjay singh kaa naam aage kiya
 i do not need the AAP, they need me, after speaking out loud against the Aam Aadmi Party and Arvind Kejriwal, Alka Lamba looks at her future in the party, to this question, she replied that Alka Lamba does not need AAP, but you a legislator like me is required
 haalank, alka ne bataaya ki wo anaupchaarik taur par party se alag ho chuki hai, lekin apana kaarykaal puraa hone tak istipha nahin dengi
 Let us tell you that AAP was formed in 2012 after the Anna movement
 jiske baad 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main party ko 28 siten mili thim or congress ke samarthan se kejariwal ne 49 din kii sarkaar chalaai thi
 After this, when the assembly elections were held again in 2015, AAP won 67 out of 70 seats
 vahiin, isse pehle 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main AAP ko haalanki ek bhi saansad dilli se nahin mila, lekin party ko kareeb 33 pratishat vot mila, jo congress se doguna tha
 But in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the vote percentage of AAP has come down to 18 percent, while Congress has increased to 22
 5 pratishat par pahunch gai he

 sushant singh rajput or shraddha kapur kii film chhichhore kaa trailor jab aayaa tha, tab logon ko laga tha ki ye aamir khan kii 3 idiyats yaa karan johar kii student of da year jaisi hogi
 Seeing this film, you may remember other films, but this does not mean that Chichhore has no identity of his own
 college life kii baat aati he to sabase pehle hamaare dimag main aamir khan kii film 3 idiyats kaa khyaal aata he
 Rajkumar Hirani's masterpiece is less often seen
 wo film ejineering college ke students kii kahani par aadhaarit thi or diarector nitesh tiwari kii film chhichhore bhi ejineering college ke students kii hi kahani par aadhaarit he
 Just ahead of this point, the two films are completely different
 ye kahani he ejineering kii padhai kar chuke aniruddh pathak, maaya or unke doston sexa, acid, mummy, derek or bevada kii
 The story begins in a flashback, where Anirudh i
e
 Anni (sushant Singh Rajput) is thinking about the uproar in his hostel
 aniruddh or maaya (shraddha kapur) kaa ek betaa he, raghav, jo apane maa-baap kii tarah ejineering karne kaa sapana liye ji rahaa he
 Raghav is the only reason that all these friends meet each other once again
 haalanki ye kaaran bahut dukhadaayi he
 If you want to know this then you have to watch the film
 film main sushant singh rajput ne badhiya kaam kiya he
 a smart student who cleverly drives the front man crazy, and a father who loves his son very much - both these aspects of the character have played well
 iske alaava actor varun sharma, taahir raaj bhasin, naveen polishetty, tushaar pandey, pratik babbar or saharsha shukla kaa kaam bhi badhiya he
 Shraddha Kapoor is looking very beautiful in her character
 varun sharma ne film phukare main chuuchaa kaa kirdaar nibhaakar use amar kar diya
 Till now, we have all seen him playing light-hearted characters
 in kirdaaron main unhone hameshaa badhiya kaam karke dikhaaya he
 But this time you will see Varun Sharma doing comedy as well as hitting heavy dialogues and making sense in the right
 varun kaa kaam bahut impressive hai
 Tahir Raj Bhasin adopts the scene in which he takes place
 iske alaava pratik babbar bhi kaaphi achche the
 My personal favorite is Naveen Polyshetti
 unka kirdaar naa sirf mjedaar he, balki unka kaam bhi utana hi badhiya he
 Watching a film will not make you feel like you are watching a movie
 college life kii kahani jab parde par chal rahi hoti he tab aapako apane skool / college ke din yaad aa rahe hote hai
 Punch is very right in the film
 ekadam mast kamedi dikhaai gai he
 Dangal director Nitesh Tiwari makes all the great movies that we all know
 nitesh ne jis tarah se is kahani ko saamne rakhaa he or jo sikh dene kii koshish he, wo tarif ke laayak he
 This does not mean that there is no scope for improvement
 lekin kabhi-kabhi logon ko lite harted filmein dekhne kii jarurat bhi hoti he
 The songs of the film are also good
 ye film sabhi ko ek bahut jaruri massej detii he, jo aajkal kii janata kaa samajhnaa bahut jaruri he

 Loot is the biggest crime incident in Delhi in recent times
 ek aisi vaardaat, jisamen luteron ne din-dahaade ek atm centre main security guard ko goliyon kaa nishaanaa banaakar puure dedh karod rupee lut liye

5 crore

 yani bazaar main acchhee-khaasi bheed he
 But there is no trace of any human far and wide

 Taking advantage of this fear of the people, the crooks ran away after collecting the goods
 blike color kii pulsar bike par aae donon lutere dedh karod rupee kii ataichi uthaakar aaraam se chalate banate hai
 One miscreant kept the motorcycle, while the other miscreant scared the people holding a briefcase full of money after shooting the guard
 chunki noton se bhari ataichi kaaphi baari thi, isliye pehle to wo ataichi ko atm centre se uthaakar bike ke paas lekar aayaa or phir use bich main rakhkar bike ke peeche baith gaya
 At the same time, a silver color centro car also comes from the opposite side, but perhaps the person on the car had no news about these robbers
 lihaaja, wo luteron ko jagah bhi detaa he or lutere bade aaraam se bike par savaar hokar camere kii jad se baahar nikal jate hai
 However, despite this chaos, a mobile clip of a man is able to shoot from the other side of the road
 ab 17 second kaa ye clip police ke paas he
 The police hope that with the help of this clip, she can reach the miscreants soon
 darasal, helmet pahane hone kii vajah se in tasveeron main badmaashon kaa cheharaa beshak saaf na ho, lekin in tasveeron main deal-doll or body language kii pahchaan behad aasaan he
 According to police sources, the way this incident has been carried out, it can be the work of old miscreants, not just novice boys
 aise main police ko ab apane intelligence or mukhabiron se ummid he, jo in tasveeron ko dekhakar badmaashon ke bare main koi pukhta suraag de sakate hai

 The BJP has said on the issue that this provision has nothing to do with secularism and the party feels that it is a weapon of 'suppression' of Indian citizens
 kendriya mantri faruk abdulla ne doharaaya ki jammu-kashmir ko vishesh darja dene vaale anuchhed 370 ko radd nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He demanded that this provision be strengthened
 neshnal conference netaa ne srinagar main kaha, 'koi bhi, chaahe (narendra) modi hon yaa koi or, vah anuchhed 370 ko radd nahin kar saktaa

 ' umr ne kaha, 'hamaare desh main anuchhed 370 ko lekar kai galatfahami he
 It is said that because of this article, people cannot buy land in the state for other parts of the country
 yah baaki bhartiya ko rajya se baahar rakhane kii kashmiriyon kii chaal he
 This is completely wrong

 ' unhone kaha ki anuchhed 370 rajya ke aantarik kanoon ke kisi bhi tarah judaa hua nahin he

 hamaari nazar is khabar par he magar aaj nahin
 Today, on the occasion of March 8, i want to tell the story of women working in government banks
 bank series kaa yah 9 waan ak he
 This series started with salary, but gradually as the women bankers started opening up and telling themselves, every day one of their stories fills me with anger and wonder as to whether so many women can be enslaved in today's time 
 sainkadon kii sankhya main mahila bankeron ne apana jo haal banaaya he wo kisi bhi professor kisi bhi feminist ke liye ek aisa dastauez he, jis tak pahunchane main unhen varshon lag jaaenge
 Atrocity is a very soft word for the atrocities on women working in the bank sector today
 aap soch rahe honge main atyaachaar yaa zulm atirek main yaa bhavavesh main bol rahaa hum, magar aap khud bhi apane parichit se puch sakate hai jo sarkari bank main branch ke str par kaam karte hai
 i have listened to several audio recordings, in which regional managers are abusing and screaming at female and male branch managers
 baat-baat suspend karne kii dhamkee dete hai
 Many women are not getting promoted due to this fear
 unhen lagata he ki clerk hi thik he magar vahaan bhi kam shoshan nahin he
 If there was no issue of privacy, then many times i thought that i would make them public
 magar ye ek zindagi se zuda masalaa hota he isliye sunakar dilit karnaa pad jaataa he
 We want to tell you the story of women bankers in the voice of our female colleagues
 jab main kahata hum ki kai mahila banker to aap mujhapar bharosa kar sakate hai ki maine hazaar se zyaada massej email padhe hai or baat kii he
 In the conversation of many women, it comes out that they do not take promotions
 mahila ayog jane se darati hai
 The way i have heard the regional manager abusing me in a conversation, i do not think that any helpless person can dare to leave the job
 prime time dekhne ke baad aisi himmat aa jaae to apana jivan safal maanoonga yaa mahila ayog hi chalaa jaae
 In one episode, it was also said that all the women mps of India should form a party and enter the government banks and talk to all the women in private and submit the report from the President to the Speaker
 bank series main kai baar kaha ki paanch minute kaa kaam he, kend sarkaar ke tamaam mantralayon main yah lagu he, sarkari bainkon main maatr das minute kii baithak main yah faisla kiya ja saktaa tha
 What could have been better from the day of March 8, but it seems that the group of chairmen does not feel any more trouble than their status
 aap kisi bhi mahila banker ko jaanate hai yaa jo aapke pados main rahati he to aap puch sakate hai
 What i said is correct or not
 ye sari samasya tab se badi he jab se bank shakhaon par tarah-tarah kii beemaa or mutual fund bechney kaa dabaav badha he
 They are given a target every day
 computer main aisa software he ki agar aap 5 atal pension yojana nahin bechenge or system main nahin daalenge to aap logout nahin kar sakate, yani computer band hi nahin hoga or aap branch main baithe rahenge, kyonki bina logout kiye aap branch band kar ghar nahin ja sakate hai
 On 7 March, the employees sat in a bank till 8
30 pm
 bainkon ke software main aisa system ho saktaa he jo aapako ghulaam kii tarah us computer se baandh saktaa he
 It is called cso lop in technical language
 jab is par lekh likhaa to shaam ko khabar ai ki aaj system saadhe chah baje hi band ho gaya, yani ve ghar ja sake
 This means that people sitting in the upper chair have started to understand
 unamem saamne aane kii himmat nahin, magar meri baat par ection liya iske liye shukriya
 Many banks have ordered to examine and build women's toilets
 meri series ke baad
 Thanks to the chairmen, but the complaint is still many
 bainkon kii aarthik sthiti manageron or clerkon ne kharaab nahin kii he
 The people above have done it
 magar maar pad rahi he banker par
 Salary is not increasing due to npas, new people are not getting recruited
 kaam karne ke halaat bighad chuke hai
 They are said to increase business, create tension of the target
 enpie ke kaaran united bank of india kii haalat karaab he
 The decrees issued by this bank for 8 poorly performing branches are frightening
 yahaan tak likhaa he ki branch se airkandishan or janarator hataa liya jaae
 The manager and the deputy manager should not be given salary, should not be discharged
 is lihaaz se to kai mantriyon se gaadi ghoda sab chin lenaa chahie
 If the bank's NPA is more than 6 percent, then it should be removed from the room of the AC chairman or the room of the branch manager
 ol india bank associshan ne tughluqi bataate hue is farmaan kii ninda kii he
 Alam is that a bank issued a circular on Women's Day
 cross sailing ke naam par beemaa polisy bechney kaa jo target diya ja rahaa he uski yatnaa stri purush bankeron donon bhugat rahe hai
 When that bank issued a circular on the occasion of Women's Day, listen carefully to what you wrote and did
 bank ne hameshaa mahilaon ke shashaktikaran kaa prayaas kiya he or raashtra nirmaan main unki bhoomika ko pahachaanaa he
 Women are changing the face of India's society and economy
 mahila diwas ke maukey par ham mahila karmchaariyon ke liye vishesh abhiyaan kaa jashn manaanaa chaahate hai
 It has been decided that the target is being given to women employees of Allahabad region from March 7 to March 9
 kahaan to mahila diwas ke maukey par unhen target kii yatnaa se mukti di jaani chahie magar unhen beemaa bechney kaa target de diya gaya
 On a festival day, work is given less or it is said that today is Holi, Happy, today you work all day
 kya aisa hota he
 They have to sell two life insurance policies of forty thousand and get a mutual fund of up to 5 lakhs
 hamane bank kaa naam nahin liya magar us circular par bank of baroda likhaa tha
 The life of women bankers and male bankers has deteriorated due to selling insurance
 kuch or bainkon ne aaj ke din mahalog in de ghoshit kar diya yani usee target ko puraa kiye bina aap ghar nahin ja sakate
 The comments kai mahilaon ne bataaya ki unhen vasuuli ke liye akele bheja jaataa he
 Tell Nirav Modi ji runs away alone and women bankers are being sent there alone
 jab ye mahila banker jaati hai to unke saath koi suraksha nahin hoti
 i am bringing out the inner thing, so i cannot reveal the identity, but believe me, i was shaken while listening to the audio video
 kaash sarkaar main kisi kaa dil pasij jaae
 a woman would see a lawyer and get a court order from the Fact Finding Committee
 bank ke bheetar staff kii baari kami he
 a man is working five men
 wo bhi bank ke alaava beemaa companiyon kaa bhi kaam kar rahaa he
 This female banker cannot speak in front of me, but i have found a new way of speaking
 wo apni kahani likhakar bhejti hai, main apni taraf se thodi pherbadal kar detaa hum taaki ve pakad main na aaen or mahila sahyogi kii awaz main suna detaa hum
 Otherwise the Chairman would have made me an idiot by answering here and there
 vaise kai pitaaon ko meri siries juthi lagi, jab unhone bank main kaam kar rahi apni beti or bahu se poocha to jawaab sunakar sharminda ho gaye
 i have such a letter with them
 maine ek bank nahin, ek mahila banker nahin balki kai bainkon kii kai mahila bankeron se baat kar mahila diwas par ye pesh kiya he is ummid main ki kahin kuch badal jayega
 It should begin with that child care leave should be announced within ten minutes
 main sahi kahata hum kisi din is par eemaandaaree se jaanch ho gai, report ban gai to aap un kisson ko janenge jisaki kalpana bhi nahin kar sakate
 This is the 9th Ak of the Bank Series
 yah siries selary se shuru hui thi, lekin jab dhire-dhire mahila banker khulne lageen or apni baat bataane lageen to har din unki koi dastaan mujhe gusse or hairaani se bhar detaa he ki aaj ke samay main kya itani mahilaon ko gulam banaaya ja saktaa he
 Hundreds of women bankers have created their own situation, it is a document for any professor, any Feminist, which will take them years to reach
 bank sector main kaam karne vaali mahilaon par aaj jo atyaachaar ho rahaa he, uske liye atyaachaar behad mulaayam shabd he
 You may be thinking that i am speaking in atrocities or atrocities or in excesses, but you can also ask your acquaintance who works at the branch level in a government bank
 maine kai audio recording sune hai, jisamen riginal manager mahila or purush branch manageron ko gandi-gandi gaali de rahe hai or unpar cheekhte hai
 Thing threatens to suspend
 is dar se bahut si mahilaayein pramotion nahin le rahi hai
 They feel that the clerk is fine but there is no less exploitation
 gopneeyata kaa masalaa na hota to kai baar khyaal aayaa ki inhen public kar detaa hum
 But it is more than a life issue, so hearing has to be deleted
 ham mahila bankeron ke kisse ko apni mahila sahyogiyon kii awaz main aapako sunaanaa chaahate hai
 When i say that many women bankers, you can trust me that i have read and spoken more than a thousand message emails
 kai mahilaon kii baatcheet main yah baat nikalakar aati he ki ve pramotion nahin leti he
 Women are afraid of going to the commission
 maine ek baatcheet main jis tarah se riginal manager ko gaali dete suna he, mujhe nahin lagata he ki naukari se laachaar koi jane kii himmat kar saktaa he
 If you have the courage after watching prime time, then i will consider my life successful or the women's commission goes away
 ek episod main kaha bhi tha ki bharat kii sari mahila saansadon ko dal banaakar sarkari bainkon ke bheetar ghus janaa chahie or akele main sari auraton se batkar raashtrapati se lekar spikar ko report saunp deni chahie
 Many times in the bank series said that it is a five-minute work, it is applicable in all the ministries of the central government, it could have been decided in a meeting of only ten minutes in public sector banks
 8 march ke din se acha kya ho saktaa tha magar lagata he chairamainon kii jamaat ko apane rutabe se zyaada kisi kii takalif badi nahin lagati he
 You know any female banker or who lives in your neighborhood, you can ask
 maine jo kaha wo sahi he yaa nahin
 All these problems have increased since the pressure on bank branches to sell various types of insurance and mutual funds
 unhen har din kaa target diya jaataa he
 The computer has such software that if you do not sell 5 Atal Pension Yojana and do not put it in the system then you cannot logout, that is, the computer will not shut down and you will be sitting in the branch, because without logout you will not close the branch and go home
 Can
 7 march ke din ek bank main karmchaaree saadhe aath baje tak baithe rahe
 Banks' software may have a system that can bind you to that computer like a slave
 ise takneekee bhashaa main cso lop kehete hai
 When i wrote an article on this, there was news in the evening that today the system stopped at half past six, that is, they could go home
 iskaa matlab ye hua ki upar kii kursi par baithe log samajhane lage hai
 He did not dare to come forward, but took action on my point, thank you for this
 kai baikon ne mahilaon ke shauchalay kii jaanch or banane ke aadesh die hai
 After my series
 chairamainon ko shukriya magar shikaayat abhi bhi bahut he
 The economic condition of banks has not deteriorated by managers and clerks
 upar ke logon ne kii he
 But the banker is being hit
 enpie ke kaaran selary nahin bad rahi he, nae log nahin bhartee ho rahe hai
 Working conditions have deteriorated
 unpar bijness badhaane ko kaha jaataa he, target kaa tanaav paidaa kiya jaataa he
 The condition of United Bank of India is bad due to NPA
 is bank ne karaab pradarshan karne vaali 8 shakhaon ke liye jo farmaan jari kiye hai wo bhayaavah he
 It is even written that the air conditioner and generator be removed from the branch
 manager or dipti manager ko selary na di jaae, chuttee na di jaae
 In this sense, the horse and horse should be taken away from many ministers
 agar bank kaa enpie 6 pratishat se zyaada ho to asi chairman ke kamare se nikaalnaa chahie yaa branch manager ke kamare
 The All India Bank Association has condemned this decree as Tughlaqi
 alam yah he ki he ek bank ne mahila diwas par ek circular jari kiya
 Both male and female bankers are suffering from the target of selling insurance policies in the name of cross selling
 mahila diwas ke avasar par us bank ne jab circular jari kiya to kya likhaa or kya kiya dhyaan se suniye
 The bank has always strived for the empowerment of women and recognized their role in nation building
 mahilaayein bharat ke samaaj or arthvyavastha kaa cheharaa badal rahi hai
 On the occasion of Women's Day, we want to celebrate a special campaign for women employees
 yah tay kiya gaya he ki 7 march se 9 march ke bich elahabaad kshetra kii mahila karmchaariyon ko target diya ja rahaa he
 Where on the occasion of Women's Day, they should be freed from the torture of the target, but they were given a target to sell insurance
 kisi tyohaar ke din kaam kam diya jaataa he yaa ye kaha jaataa he ki aaj holi he, mubarak, aaj tum din bhar kaam karo
 Does it happen unhen chalis hazaar kii do jivan beemaa policy bechni he or 5 lakh tak kaa mutual fund karwaanaa he
 We did not take the name of the bank but Bank of Baroda was written on that circular
 beemaa bechney ke kaaran hi mahila bankeron or purush bankeron kii zindagi karaab ho gai he
 Some other banks have declared Mahalog in Day today, that is, you cannot go home without fulfilling the same target
 tippaniyan Many women reported that they are sent alone for recovery
 bataaiye yahaan neerav modi ji akele bhaag jate hai or vahaan mahila bankeron ko akele bheja ja rahaa he
 When these women go to the banker, there is no security with them
 main bheetar kii baat baahar laa rahaa hum, isliye pahchaan saamne nahin laa saktaa magar yakeen kiijie audio video sunate dekhte kaanp gaya
 i wish someone's heart would be swept away in the government
 koi mahila vakil dekh leti or adaalat se fact finding cameti kaa aadesh le aati
 There is a huge shortage of staff within the bank
 ek aadmi paanch aadmi kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 Apart from the bank, he is also working as insurance companies
 ye mahila banker saamne aakar bol nahin sakati magar maine unke bolne kaa nayaa tarika nikaala he
 She sends her story by writing, i make a little shuffle on my side so that they do not get caught and listen in the voice of a female colleague
 varanaa chairman log to mujhe ullu bana dete idhar-udhar kaa jawaab dekar
 Although many fathers found my series false, when they asked their daughter and daughter-in-law working in the bank, they were embarrassed to hear the answer
 unki aisi chitthee mere paas he
 i have presented this on Women's Day by talking to many women bankers, not a bank, not a woman banker, but in the hope that something will change
 isaki shuruyaat isse honi chahie ki das minute ke bheetar child care live kaa elaan kar diya janaa chahie
 i am right, one day it was honestly investigated, if the report is made, then you will know the stories that you cannot even imagine
 bank sector main kaam karne vaali mahilaon par aaj jo atyaachaar ho rahaa he, uske liye atyaachaar behad mulaayam shabd he
 You may be thinking that i am speaking in atrocities or atrocities or in excesses, but you can also ask your acquaintance who works at the branch level in a government bank
 maine kai audio recording sune hai, jisamen riginal manager mahila or purush branch manageron ko gandi-gandi gaali de rahe hai or unpar cheekhte hai

 Women are afraid of going to the commission
 maine ek baatcheet main jis tarah se riginal manager ko gaali dete suna he, mujhe nahin lagata he ki naukari se laachaar koi jane kii himmat kar saktaa he
 If you have the courage after watching prime time, then i will consider my life successful or the women's commission goes away
 ek episod main kaha bhi tha ki bharat kii sari mahila saansadon ko dal banaakar sarkari bainkon ke bheetar ghus janaa chahie or akele main sari auraton se batkar raashtrapati se lekar spikar ko report saunp deni chahie
 Many times in the bank series said that it is a five-minute work, it is applicable in all the ministries of the central government, it could have been decided in a meeting of only ten minutes in public sector banks
 8 march ke din se acha kya ho saktaa tha magar lagata he chairamainon kii jamaat ko apane rutabe se zyaada kisi kii takalif badi nahin lagati he
 You know any female banker or who lives in your neighborhood, you can ask
 maine jo kaha wo sahi he yaa nahin
 All these problems have increased since the pressure on bank branches to sell various types of insurance and mutual funds
 unhen har din kaa target diya jaataa he
 The computer has such software that if you do not sell 5 Atal Pension Yojana and do not put it in the system then you cannot logout, that is, the computer will not shut down and you will be sitting in the branch, because without logout you will not close the branch and go home
 Can
 7 march ke din ek bank main karmchaaree saadhe aath baje tak baithe rahe
 Banks' software may have a system that can bind you to that computer like a slave
 ise takneekee bhashaa main cso lop kehete hai
 When i wrote an article on this, there was news in the evening that today the system stopped at half past six, that is, they could go home
 iskaa matlab ye hua ki upar kii kursi par baithe log samajhane lage hai
 He did not dare to come forward, but took action on my point, thank you for this
 kai baikon ne mahilaon ke shauchalay kii jaanch or banane ke aadesh die hai
 After my series
 chairamainon ko shukriya magar shikaayat abhi bhi bahut he
 The economic condition of banks has not deteriorated by managers and clerks
 upar ke logon ne kii he
 But the banker is being hit
 enpie ke kaaran selary nahin bad rahi he, nae log nahin bhartee ho rahe hai
 Working conditions have deteriorated
 unpar bijness badhaane ko kaha jaataa he, target kaa tanaav paidaa kiya jaataa he
 The condition of United Bank of India is bad due to NPA
 is bank ne karaab pradarshan karne vaali 8 shakhaon ke liye jo farmaan jari kiye hai wo bhayaavah he
 It is even written that the air conditioner and generator be removed from the branch
 manager or dipti manager ko selary na di jaae, chuttee na di jaae
 In this sense, the horse and horse should be taken away from many ministers
 agar bank kaa enpie 6 pratishat se zyaada ho to asi chairman ke kamare se nikaalnaa chahie yaa branch manager ke kamare
 The All India Bank Association has condemned this decree as Tughlaqi
 alam yah he ki he ek bank ne mahila diwas par ek circular jari kiya
 Both male and female bankers are suffering from the target of selling insurance policies in the name of cross selling
 mahila diwas ke avasar par us bank ne jab circular jari kiya to kya likhaa or kya kiya dhyaan se suniye
 The bank has always strived for the empowerment of women and recognized their role in nation building
 mahilaayein bharat ke samaaj or arthvyavastha kaa cheharaa badal rahi hai
 On the occasion of Women's Day, we want to celebrate a special campaign for women employees
 yah tay kiya gaya he ki 7 march se 9 march ke bich elahabaad kshetra kii mahila karmchaariyon ko target diya ja rahaa he
 Where on the occasion of Women's Day, they should be freed from the torture of the target, but they were given a target to sell insurance
 kisi tyohaar ke din kaam kam diya jaataa he yaa ye kaha jaataa he ki aaj holi he, mubarak, aaj tum din bhar kaam karo
 Does it happen unhen chalis hazaar kii do jivan beemaa policy bechni he or 5 lakh tak kaa mutual fund karwaanaa he
 We did not take the name of the bank but Bank of Baroda was written on that circular
 beemaa bechney ke kaaran hi mahila bankeron or purush bankeron kii zindagi karaab ho gai he
 Some other banks have declared Mahalog in Day today, that is, you cannot go home without fulfilling the same target
 tippaniyan Many women reported that they are sent alone for recovery
 bataaiye yahaan neerav modi ji akele bhaag jate hai or vahaan mahila bankeron ko akele bheja ja rahaa he
 When these women go to the banker, there is no security with them
 main bheetar kii baat baahar laa rahaa hum, isliye pahchaan saamne nahin laa saktaa magar yakeen kiijie audio video sunate dekhte kaanp gaya
 i wish someone's heart would be swept away in the government
 koi mahila vakil dekh leti or adaalat se fact finding cameti kaa aadesh le aati
 There is a huge shortage of staff within the bank
 ek aadmi paanch aadmi kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 Apart from the bank, he is also working as insurance companies
 ye mahila banker saamne aakar bol nahin sakati magar maine unke bolne kaa nayaa tarika nikaala he
 She sends her story by writing, i make a little shuffle on my side so that they do not get caught and listen in the voice of a female colleague
 varanaa chairman log to mujhe ullu bana dete idhar-udhar kaa jawaab dekar
 Although many fathers found my series false, when they asked their daughter and daughter-in-law working in the bank, they were embarrassed to hear the answer
 unki aisi chitthee mere paas he
 i have presented this on Women's Day by talking to many women bankers, not a bank, not a woman banker, but in the hope that something will change
 isaki shuruyaat isse honi chahie ki das minute ke bheetar child care live kaa elaan kar diya janaa chahie
 i am right, one day it was honestly investigated, if the report is made, then you will know the stories that you cannot even imagine
 jab main kahata hum ki kai mahila banker to aap mujhapar bharosa kar sakate hai ki maine hazaar se zyaada massej email padhe hai or baat kii he
 In the conversation of many women, it comes out that they do not take promotions
 mahila ayog jane se darati hai
 The way i have heard the regional manager abusing me in a conversation, i do not think that any helpless person can dare to leave the job
 prime time dekhne ke baad aisi himmat aa jaae to apana jivan safal maanoonga yaa mahila ayog hi chalaa jaae
 In one episode, it was also said that all the women mps of India should form a party and enter the government banks and talk to all the women in private and submit the report from the President to the Speaker
 bank series main kai baar kaha ki paanch minute kaa kaam he, kend sarkaar ke tamaam mantralayon main yah lagu he, sarkari bainkon main maatr das minute kii baithak main yah faisla kiya ja saktaa tha
 What could have been better from the day of March 8, but it seems that the group of chairmen does not feel any more trouble than their status
 aap kisi bhi mahila banker ko jaanate hai yaa jo aapke pados main rahati he to aap puch sakate hai
 What i said is correct or not
 ye sari samasya tab se badi he jab se bank shakhaon par tarah-tarah kii beemaa or mutual fund bechney kaa dabaav badha he
 They are given a target every day
 computer main aisa software he ki agar aap 5 atal pension yojana nahin bechenge or system main nahin daalenge to aap logout nahin kar sakate, yani computer band hi nahin hoga or aap branch main baithe rahenge, kyonki bina logout kiye aap branch band kar ghar nahin ja sakate hai
 On 7 March, the employees sat in a bank till 8
30 pm
 bainkon ke software main aisa system ho saktaa he jo aapako ghulaam kii tarah us computer se baandh saktaa he
 It is called cso lop in technical language
 jab is par lekh likhaa to shaam ko khabar ai ki aaj system saadhe chah baje hi band ho gaya, yani ve ghar ja sake
 This means that people sitting in the upper chair have started to understand
 unamem saamne aane kii himmat nahin, magar meri baat par ection liya iske liye shukriya
 Many banks have ordered to examine and build women's toilets
 meri series ke baad
 Thanks to the chairmen, but the complaint is still many
 bainkon kii aarthik sthiti manageron or clerkon ne kharaab nahin kii he
 The people above have done it
 magar maar pad rahi he banker par
 Salary is not increasing due to npas, new people are not getting recruited
 kaam karne ke halaat bighad chuke hai
 They are said to increase business, create tension of the target
 enpie ke kaaran united bank of india kii haalat karaab he
 The decrees issued by this bank for 8 poorly performing branches are frightening
 yahaan tak likhaa he ki branch se airkandishan or janarator hataa liya jaae
 The manager and the deputy manager should not be given salary, should not be discharged
 is lihaaz se to kai mantriyon se gaadi ghoda sab chin lenaa chahie
 If the bank's NPA is more than 6 percent, then it should be removed from the room of the AC chairman or the room of the branch manager
 ol india bank associshan ne tughluqi bataate hue is farmaan kii ninda kii he
 Alam is that a bank issued a circular on Women's Day
 cross sailing ke naam par beemaa polisy bechney kaa jo target diya ja rahaa he uski yatnaa stri purush bankeron donon bhugat rahe hai
 When that bank issued a circular on the occasion of Women's Day, listen carefully to what you wrote and did
 bank ne hameshaa mahilaon ke shashaktikaran kaa prayaas kiya he or raashtra nirmaan main unki bhoomika ko pahachaanaa he
 Women are changing the face of India's society and economy
 mahila diwas ke maukey par ham mahila karmchaariyon ke liye vishesh abhiyaan kaa jashn manaanaa chaahate hai
 It has been decided that the target is being given to women employees of Allahabad region from March 7 to March 9
 kahaan to mahila diwas ke maukey par unhen target kii yatnaa se mukti di jaani chahie magar unhen beemaa bechney kaa target de diya gaya
 On a festival day, work is given less or it is said that today is Holi, Happy, today you work all day
 kya aisa hota he
 They have to sell two life insurance policies of forty thousand and get a mutual fund of up to 5 lakhs
 hamane bank kaa naam nahin liya magar us circular par bank of baroda likhaa tha
 The life of women bankers and male bankers has deteriorated due to selling insurance
 kuch or bainkon ne aaj ke din mahalog in de ghoshit kar diya yani usee target ko puraa kiye bina aap ghar nahin ja sakate
 The comments kai mahilaon ne bataaya ki unhen vasuuli ke liye akele bheja jaataa he
 Tell Nirav Modi ji runs away alone and women bankers are being sent there alone
 jab ye mahila banker jaati hai to unke saath koi suraksha nahin hoti
 i am bringing out the inner thing, so i cannot reveal the identity, but believe me, i was shaken while listening to the audio video
 kaash sarkaar main kisi kaa dil pasij jaae
 a woman would see a lawyer and get a court order from the Fact Finding Committee
 bank ke bheetar staff kii baari kami he
 a man is working five men
 wo bhi bank ke alaava beemaa companiyon kaa bhi kaam kar rahaa he
 This female banker cannot speak in front of me, but i have found a new way of speaking
 wo apni kahani likhakar bhejti hai, main apni taraf se thodi pherbadal kar detaa hum taaki ve pakad main na aaen or mahila sahyogi kii awaz main suna detaa hum
 Otherwise the Chairman would have made me an idiot by answering here and there
 vaise kai pitaaon ko meri siries juthi lagi, jab unhone bank main kaam kar rahi apni beti or bahu se poocha to jawaab sunakar sharminda ho gaye
 i have such a letter with them
 maine ek bank nahin, ek mahila banker nahin balki kai bainkon kii kai mahila bankeron se baat kar mahila diwas par ye pesh kiya he is ummid main ki kahin kuch badal jayega
 It should begin with that child care leave should be announced within ten minutes

 Where on the occasion of Women's Day, they should be freed from the torture of the target, but they were given a target to sell insurance
 kisi tyohaar ke din kaam kam diya jaataa he yaa ye kaha jaataa he ki aaj holi he, mubarak, aaj tum din bhar kaam karo
 Does it happen unhen chalis hazaar kii do jivan beemaa policy bechni he or 5 lakh tak kaa mutual fund karwaanaa he
 We did not take the name of the bank but Bank of Baroda was written on that circular
 beemaa bechney ke kaaran hi mahila bankeron or purush bankeron kii zindagi karaab ho gai he
 Some other banks have declared Mahalog in Day today, that is, you cannot go home without fulfilling the same target
 tippaniyan Many women reported that they are sent alone for recovery
 bataaiye yahaan neerav modi ji akele bhaag jate hai or vahaan mahila bankeron ko akele bheja ja rahaa he
 When these women go to the banker, there is no security with them
 main bheetar kii baat baahar laa rahaa hum, isliye pahchaan saamne nahin laa saktaa magar yakeen kiijie audio video sunate dekhte kaanp gaya
 i wish someone's heart would be swept away in the government

 There is a huge shortage of staff within the bank
 ek aadmi paanch aadmi kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 Apart from the bank, he is also working as insurance companies
 ye mahila banker saamne aakar bol nahin sakati magar maine unke bolne kaa nayaa tarika nikaala he
 She sends her story by writing, i make a little shuffle on my side so that they do not get caught and listen in the voice of a female colleague

 Although many fathers found my series false, when they asked their daughter and daughter-in-law working in the bank, they were embarrassed to hear the answer
 unki aisi chitthee mere paas he
 i have presented this on Women's Day by talking to many women bankers, not a bank, not a woman banker, but in the hope that something will change
 isaki shuruyaat isse honi chahie ki das minute ke bheetar child care live kaa elaan kar diya janaa chahie
 i am right, one day it was honestly investigated, if the report is made, then you will know the stories that you cannot even imagine
 hamane bank kaa naam nahin liya magar us circular par bank of baroda likhaa tha
 The life of women bankers and male bankers has deteriorated due to selling insurance

 Tell Nirav Modi ji runs away alone and women bankers are being sent there alone
 jab ye mahila banker jaati hai to unke saath koi suraksha nahin hoti
 i am bringing out the inner thing, so i cannot reveal the identity, but believe me, i was shaken while listening to the audio video
 kaash sarkaar main kisi kaa dil pasij jaae
 a woman would see a lawyer and get a court order from the Fact Finding Committee
 bank ke bheetar staff kii baari kami he
 a man is working five men

 This female banker cannot speak in front of me, but i have found a new way of speaking
 wo apni kahani likhakar bhejti hai, main apni taraf se thodi pherbadal kar detaa hum taaki ve pakad main na aaen or mahila sahyogi kii awaz main suna detaa hum
 Otherwise the Chairman would have made me an idiot by answering here and there

 i have such a letter with them

 For the first time in the mid-day meal, pulses will also be included in the mid-day meal to consume 18 lakh tonnes of pulses stocked in the government godowns
 sarkaar kii duusari yojanaon main bhi daal ko kharch kiya jayega
 On Friday, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs decided that different departments of the government would change their rules and instructions to use pulses wherever possible to consume pulses lying in government warehouses
 isamen mid de mile ke alaava sarkari aspataalon or un sabhi vibhaagon or agenciyon main daal kii khapat kii jaaegi jo khaane pine se jude hue hai
 Apart from this, the government will also sell pulses lying in buffer stock in the open market
 rajyon ko bhi bazaar se kam keemat main daal muhaiyaa karaayaa jaaegi 
 All the Ministries related to food and drink have been asked to make a report about how much pulses they can consume within 3 months and submit it to the Food Ministry
 darasal daal kii baari-bharkam stock ko khapaana sarkaar ke liye nai musiibat ban gaya he
 This is the first time when more stock of pulses has become a problem for the government than the shortage of pulses
 hua asal main yah ki pichley saal jab daal kii keemten 200 rupee prati kilo ke kareeb pahunch gai thi tab isko lekar kaaphi bavaal machaa tha or sarkaar ko daal kii keemat ko kam karne ke liye duniya bhar se daal aayaat karnaa padaa
 Taking a lesson from last year, the government had decided to create a buffer stock of 2 xxrep 6 0 tonnes of pulses so that if the prices of pulses in the market increase more, then the government warehouse can be used to control the price of pulses by upgrading the pulses
 daal kaa bafer stock to ban gaya lekin is saal kuch aisa hua jo isse pehle kabhi nahin hua tha
 There was a record breaking yield of pulses in the country as farmers sowed pulses on a large scale in view of the increased prices of last year
 nateeja ye hua ki daal kii keemten gir kar 60- 70 rupee prati kilo tak pahunch gai or ab hangaamaa is baat par much gaya ki kisaanon ko daal kii uchit keemat nahin mil paa rahi he
 In such a situation, if the government used the buffer stock pulses in the market, then the prices would have gone down further
 daal ko bahut zyada dinon tak stock nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki vah kharaab hone lagata he
 That is why the consumption of huge stocks of 18 xxrep 5 0 tonnes of pulses became a major headache for the Ministry of Food
 shuukravaar ke cabinet ke faisle ke baadakhaadya mantralyako ummid he ki uske bafer stock kaa kaaphi daal kharch ho sakegaa

 Six Rajya Sabha seats are being vacated, but elections will be held on 5 only
 isaki vajah yah he ki chhathi seat kaa maamla philhal adaalat main he
 The Rajya Sabha membership of JDU rebel leader Sharad Yadav was terminated by Vice President Venkaiah Naidu, following which he moved the court challenging the decision
 23 march ko hone vaale rajyasabha chunaav ko lekar bihar memraajnneetik sargarmitej ho gai he
 JDU and RJD are believed to get two seats each on the basis of number strength and BJP is going to get 1 seat
 argedy ko rajyasabha chunaav main 2 seat milanaa to tay he lekin in 2 siton par party kaa ummidavaar koun hoga isko lekar sanshay kii sthiti bani hui he
 Everyone has their claim
 party ke puraane netaa raghuvansh prasad singh, shivanand tiwari or jagadanand singh se lekar mahagathbandhan main shaamil hue jithan ram maanjhi, sabhi in 2 siton ke liye daavedaar maane ja rahe hai

 khaali hone vaali 11 siton par bhi argedy ke koun-koun ummidavaar honge, isko lekar bhi jod-tod khel chal rahaa he
 In such a situation, who will be the RJD candidate in the Rajya Sabha elections and the Legislative Council elections, it will not be decided by RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav but his jailed father and RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav
 lalu yadav karenge ummidavaaron kaa elaanisko lekar buudhvaar ko party kii sansadeey dal kii baithak hui

 After the decision taken in this meeting, it has become clear that Lalu Prasad Yadav is still running RJD from jail
 party ko lekar koi bhi faisla ho vah lalu prasad yadav jail se hi karte hai
 The by-elections for 1 Lok Sabha and 2 Assembly seats are due in Bihar on 11 March
 lalu ne jail se hi elaan kar diya ki teenon siton par argedy chunaav ladegi lekin congress ke dwaara bhabhua vidhansabha upachunaav ladane kii ichha jataae jane ke baad lalu ne jail se hi congress ko is seat par chunaav ladane kii anumati de di
 This means that even though Lalu has handed over the reins of his party to his younger son and former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav, he still takes all decisions about the party from jail

 ‚Äô sutron ne bataaya ki manohar ke najariye kaa sanchaalan parishad ke kai sadasyon ne samarthan kiya tha jisamen ravi shastri, arun jetali, niranjan shah or chirayu amin shaamil the

 unhone kaha, ‚Äòmangalvaar ko bisisiai adhyaksh shashaank manohar or sharad pavaar ke bich baithak main faisla kiya gaya ki 26 april ko sanchaalan parishad kii baithak main ham baithkar sarvasammati se faisla karenge ki kya karnaa he

 nazar dar nazar girti, Complicating layer by layer, falak dar falak badhati, Ranges, jaane kahaan se ain
 
 
 Know how far it will go
 
 
 ye kuch paktiyaan hai, jo maheenon pehle likhi thim
 Today, people are emerging in the mind again and again
 
 
 wo shaam subah se hi ishk ke rang main rangi hui thi
 
 
 Facebook, whatsapp, Instagram, Bazaar, Restaurant and also know what was painted in the same color
 
 
 main jahaan dekh rahi thi bas pyaar hi pyaar phijaaon main failaa tha
 But i was sad
 kya hua gar vailemtine de tha, man or tan maahaul kii nazaakat ko samaj kar us din kaa saath dene ko taiyaar hi nahin the
 It was bad since morning, so decided that i would go directly to the doctor from the office
 saare kaam nipta kar jab ghar pahunchati to ek buree khabar mili, jo pulavama se thi
 The pangs increased in an already depressed mind
 
 
 sochane lagi ki aakhir insaan kis had tak nafrat paal saktaa he, kis had tak apni aatma ko ghot kar galat raah ko pakad saktaa, apane nijee lobhon ke liye kuch log kaise yuvaaon ko bargala kar aatank failaa sakate hai or vah insaan hokar insaan ko hi maar saktaa he
 
 
 After hearing the news, the TV was hurried
 khabar dekhte hi pashchimi sabhyataa kaa prem diwas pal main chhu ho gaya
 The eyes became moist and the mind became restless
 dard or badha jab pataa chalaa ki is hamale ko anjaam diya tha pulavama ke hi 20 saal ke aatanki adil ahamed daar ne
 Dar crashed into the bus of CRPF jawans from explosives laden cars, and the hatred and cowardice flew away as the entire world started thwarting terrorism
 
 
 is aatmghaatee hamale main bharat ke 40 siarpief jawan shahid ho gaye or unke is dard se puure desh main jo karaah uthi usne duniya ke har mulk kii ankhen nam kar deen
 
 
 Countries across the world were seen standing with him in India's misery
 khabaron ke anusaar siarpief kafile par hamale ko anjaam dene vaale aatanki adil ahamed daar ne is hamale se thik pehle apana ek video massej banaaya tha
 The one he made for his friends
 is video main daar ne kah rahaa tha ki 'group kaa hissaa bane or aakhri raat ke liye taiyaari karen
 But in this video, Dar said such a thing, in which he was shown the biggest fear of himself and other terrorists like himself
 
 
 wo bataa gaya ki aakhir kya cheez he jo aatankwaad ko khatm kar sakati he
 Yes, in this video, the terrorist Dar is pleading with people not to 'fall in love'
 
 
 daar kii is apil se ek baat to saaf he ki agar log pyaar karenge to jaish-e-mohammadjaise nafrat failaane vaale aatanki sanghathanon kaa naam dekhte hi dekhte khatm ho jayega
 
 
 This is true nafrat kii is jang ko agar khatm karnaa he to hamen insaan ko insaan se apni hi kaum (insaaniyat) se pyaar karnaa siikhnaa hoga
 Pulwama attack: Countries across the world were seen standing with him in India's misery
 14 farvari se lekar aaj tak main khabaron ke jariye in shaheedon ke saath bani hui hum
 i was relieved that the whole country stood together in this hour of grief
 kya vipaksh, kya sarkaar, kya hindu, kya musalmaan, kya sikh yaa isaai har 'dharm' kehane ke bajaae main kahuungi ki har bhartiya ne apane desh par jaan nyochhavar karne vaale shaheedon ko shradhanjali di
 Each of them admitted their pain in their own way
 kisi ne kavitaayen likhin, to kisi ne tasveeron yaa apane tareeke se man kii pidaa ko saamne rakhaa
 After this incident, the whole country was united
 or is ekajutata or ekta ko dekhakar mere man ne baar-baar un shaheedon ko naman kiya, or naman kiya har deshvasi ko
 Religion, caste and politics are standing along the wall
 ek duusare kaa haath thaamen har deshvasi aatankwaad ko ye sandesh de rahaa he ki bhale hi tum pyaar ke naam likhe gaye din par kitni hi nafrat failaaon or pyaar na karne kii hidaayaten do, ye desh ek he or ek rahegaa
 
 
 We are Indians before religion, religion and caste, but we are Indians
 
 
 har koi apane desh ke liye, apni sena ke liye or apane shaheedon ke liye pyaar se bhare sandesh saajha kar rahaa he
 And this is a great retort to terrorism
 mujhe to lagane laga he ki aatankwaadiyon ko khatm karne kaa sabase bada hathiyaar hi hamaari ekajutata or pyaar he
 
 
 Let this love be shared so that terrorists and terrorists cannot breathe hate in this country
 
 
 or palat den pulavama ke hamalavar adil ahamed daar kii pyaar khatm karne kii koshish ko
 
 
 After all, terrorism has told how much it is afraid of mutual love and harmony of this country
 
 
 to chalo saath milakar, pyaar baantkar or insaaniyat nibhaakar apni sena kaa saath den

 yahaan choti bachat yojanaon ke mukaable adhik byaaj daren hongin (khaastaur se ksheen hote byaaj daron ke daur main)

"cigarette is more preferred than cigarette, bidi" Several leaders criticized the statement, many opposition parties including Congress, SP and CPM criticized the statement of Shyam Charan Gupta, saying that it is really a matter of conflict of interest, because Gupta is a tobacco seller

 pehla jab unhone pakistan ke sena pramukh qamar javed baavja ko gale lagayaa or doosraa pioke ke raashtrapati masood khan ke saath pehali pankti main baithe
 Navjot Singh Sidhu, a minister in the Punjab government who joined Imran Khan's coronation in Pakistan, faced opposition on his return to his native country
 wagha-ataari seemaa se desh lautne par sthaneey logon ne siddhu ke pakistan jane kaa virodh kiya
 While answering the questions asked about Sidhu's embrace of Pakistan Army Chief General Bajwa, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has denied it
 amarinder singh ne kaha he ki jahaan tak pakistan ke army chif ko gale lagane kii baat he to ve iske paksh main nahin hai
 He (navjot Singh Sidhu) did wrong by showing affection to the Army Chief of Pakistan
 amarinder singh ne kaha ki har roj hamaare jawan shahid ho rahe hai
 One should understand that our soldiers are getting martyred on the border every day
 captain ne aage kaha mere apane regiment ne ek major or do jawan pichley maheene khoe or har roj koi na koi jawan goliyon kaa shikaar ho rahaa he
 Whose fault is this? The one who is firing, or the commander of the army, who orders, and the army chief is General Bajwa
 captain amarinder singh ne aage kaha ki jahaan tak siddhu ke shapath grahan samaaroh main shaamil hone kii baat he to wo vahaan vyaktigat taur par gaye the or punjab sarkaar se iskaa koi lenaa-dena nahin
 On sitting with the President of pok, Amarinder said that perhaps he (navjot Singh Sidhu) would not know who he (president of pok) is
 isse pehle navjot singh siddhu ne paak army chif se gale milane kii baat par safai dete hue kaha, 'agar koi (paak army chif bajva) aapke paas aae or ye kahe ki hamaari samskruti ek hi he or ham gurunanak dev ji ke 550wein prakaash parv par kartarpur border khol denge, to aise main main kya karata?'siddhune pakistan ke pradhanmantri ke shapath grahan samaaroh main pioke ke raashtrapati masood khan ke saath pehali pankti main baithne par bhi safai di or kaha ki agar aapako kahin guest ke rup main aamantrit kiya jaae, to aap vahiin baithenge jahaan aapke liye seat kii vyavastha kii gai ho
 i was sitting in another seat at the swearing-in ceremony, but they asked me to sit there
 4 years gone; still promising FARMERS a fair price
 4 years gone; FANCY SCHEMES, with NO matching budgets
 4 years gone; no JOBS for our YOUTH
 Thankfully, only 1 more year to go
 # Budget2018 Red carpets put near blast site ahead of CM Amarinder Singh's visit have been withdrawn and green carpets now put out

 This is not right

 ruthik ne kaha he ki vah film ke nirmaan main or deree nahin chaahate, is vajah se vah film chhod rahe hai
 Hrithik was to work with the film once again with his film 'agneepath' director Karan Malhotra and former co-star Kareena Kapoor, but the film would have been delayed due to Hrithik's poor health and subsequent separation from wife Suzanne
 Has gone
 ruthik ne ek bayaan main kaha, karan malhotra (nirdeshak) or maine shuddhi ke baad kisi badi film main saath kaam karne kaa faisla kiya he
 At this time i will not let the production of a film like 'shuddhi' move further
 karan malhotra ke saath ‚Äòagnipath‚Äô main kaam karne kaa abhinayta ke taur par meraa behtareen anubhav rahaa he
 Giving best wishes for the film, he said that he hopes that 'shuddhi' will prove to be a milestone in Hindi cinema
 aisi khabaren hai ki vyastata kii vajah se karina bhi film chhod rahi hai, kyonki ruthik ke swasthya kii vajah se film kii shooting kii tareekhen aage khisak gai thim
 It is also being said that in this film of Dharma Productions banner of Karan Johar, Ranvir Singh and Deepika can replace Hrithik and Kareena
 bhaajapa adhyaksh rajnath singh ne aaj kaha ki sansad or vidhaan sabhaaon main mahilaon ko 33 fisad aarakshan dene ke liye centre sarkaar jis kisi rup main vidheyak laaegi, bhaajapa uskaa samarthan karegi
 Congress is forgetting its promise
 Inaugurating the two-day meeting of the National Executive of the party's Mahila Morcha here, Singh said that the UPA government had promised to bring the Women's Reservation Bill within its hundred days of the 15th Lok Sabha, but it was fulfilled Not done
 garibi ke aadhaar par aarakshan mileunhone kaha ki bhaajapa har rup main is vidheyak ko samarthan dene ke liye taiyaar he lekin centre kii niyat main khot dikhaai detii he
 The character of the Congress has been such that to say something and do something else
 singh ne aarope lagaaya ki congress jatiyon or majahabon ko baantne kaa kaam karti he or usne desh main saamaajik samarasata paidaa nahin hone di
 Referring to the Sachar Committee report, he said that BJP favors reservation on the basis of poverty instead of reservation on the basis of religion
 chini ghuspaith kaa virodh nahin kar paa rahi he sarkaarbhajpa adhyaksh ne kaha ki niyantran rekha kaa china or pakistan dwaara baraabar ulanghan kiya ja rahaa he
 Referring to the recent incursions by Chinese helicopters into the Indian border, Singh said that the government was not even registering a proper protest against it
 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad (yuanessi) main afghanistan ke vishesh doot mahmud saikal ne pakistan ko aatank ke mudde par gheraa he
 He said that everyone knows that Pakistan is a safe haven for terrorists, but we have to go even further and act on it by building consensus in the council
 afghanistan ne pakistan ke khilaaf die saboorfghanistan main sanyukt raashtra ke rajdoot mahmud saikal ne sidhe-sidhe pakistan kaa naam nahin liya
 He said that his government has also provided the UNSC with evidence of its resolution 'one country in the region' being broken by Pakistan
 bataa den ki unhone yuanessi ke anuroop sankalp ‚Äòek desh‚Äô ke khilaaf karrwai kii jarurat par bal diya
 Saikal also said that there is more clarity among UNSC members about the presence of safe havens of terror in Pakistan and they are unanimous
 bataa den ki kuch din pehle hi 15 sadasyon vaala shaktishaalee nikaay kaa rajdoot stareey pratinidhimandal kabul daure se lautaa he
 Every member of the council believes that Sakal told PTI, 'I did not hear any member of the council deny the presence of safe havens of terror in Pakistan
 maine nahin suna kisi parishad kaa koi sadsy uthaa ho or usne kaha ho ki yah sach nahin he
 He also said, 'but we have to go further than this
 hamen parishad main aam sahmati banani hogi ki haa, ve(aatanki) vahaan (pakistan) hai, jisase suraksha parishad vahaan karrwai karne ko baadhya hogi‚Äô
 Pakistan was distracted by the issue and said that this issue has come up many times in UNSC
 parishad ke kai sadsy ab is bare main khulkar baat kar rahe hai
 And said that Pakistan has tried to wander the issue in the last few years and has always failed, but now no one is willing to listen to the arguments coming from the Pakistani military, neither in the United Nations nor On any other international stage
 pakistan he aatankiyon kaa garh or vahiin marasaikal ne osama bin laden, mullah umr or mullah akhtar kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ‚Äòzyaadaatar sadsy desh, aatank ke surakshit panaahon ke bare main jaanate hai
 They know that many heads of terrorist groups stayed in Pakistan, they were found dead in Pakistan
 unhen pakistan main maaraa gaya or vahiin dafnaaya gaya
 And now, the main names of the Taliban are in Pakistan
 yah sabko pataa he

 vitt mantri ne kaha ki tathyaatmak taur par dilli ke siem karadhaan kanoon main prastaavit badlaavon par galat bayaan de rahe hai

 vitt mantri nespasht kiya ki maujuuda praavdhaan ke tahat kar daakhile main aghoshit nakadi par keval 30 pratishat kar kaa praavdhaan tha, jise sanshodhit kanoon main badha kar 60 pratishat karne ke saath-saath is par kar ke 25 pratishat ke baraabar adhibhaar or teen pratishat upkar kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 Jaitley said, "if the taxpayer shows it in the income tax return, then the total tax will have to be 77 percent

 Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday targeted the BJP, proclaiming Jai Shri Ram in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly
 viniyog vidheyak par hui bahes ke jawaab kii shuruyaat main gahalot (ashok Gehlot) ne vidhansabha adhyaksh seepi joshi ko unke janmdin kii badhai di
 He then referred to the good rains in the state for the last few days
 unhone (ashok Gehlot) kaha ki acha monsoon aayaa he uske liye sabko badhai
 Everyone deserves congratulations for getting rid of the worry lines coming to our foreheads
 ashok gahalot (ashok Gehlot) ne aage kaha ki indradev kii badi krupa hui yah kah saktaa hum main?indradev kii badi krupa hui kah saktaa hum main? un par to aapkaa kabja nahin he khaali, jai shriram
 Amid the echo of Jai Shri Ram in the House, Gehlot took a dig at the BJP sitting in the opposition and said that now you have captured what Jai Shri Ram is
 kya hamaare log khush nahin hue jab main bolaa jai shriram? sab khush hote hai
 But the misfortune is that you get captured
 jaise gandhi ji par kar rahe ho, sardaar patel par kar rahe ho, ambedkar sahab par kar rahe ho
 this is wrong
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki jai shriram, shriram kaa naam maryaada purushottam ram hota he
 Let us also take his name among the people in such a way that there is disturbance and anger in the people
 yah acchhee baat nahin he
 Unfortunately, the way i said, Jai Shri Ram
 sab khush ho gaye chaahe paksh ho yaa vipaksh yaa pradeshvasi ho
 If someone says Allah Hu Akbar and someone objects or says that you have to speak forcefully, then it is wrong
 man se koi bole to acchhee baat he
 But if we create an atmosphere like this about Jai Shri Ram, then where will this country go? i like all teams as long as we are not playing against them but i am a big @msdhoni so I‚Äôm happy to see him shine
 https: / / t
 co / ithlk5yikj The politics has started again in Bihar over the alleged topper scam
 argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav ne kaha he ki bihar main pichley 10 saal se chaatr nakal ke sahare paas ho rahe the or ab kadai ke nattejey saamne aa rahe hai
 Congress leader Ashok Chaudhary, who is commanding the Ministry of Education, is also adding tone to his voice
 yani mahagathbandhan kii donon partiyon ke nishane par paroksh rup se mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa trek record hi he
 Nitish Kumar is the chief minister of Bihar since 2005
 jeethanram maanjhi kaa 9 maheene kaa kaarykaal chhod diya jaae to pichley 12 saal se rajya kii bagdor nitish ke hi haath main he
 Lalu Prasad supported him from outside after breaking ties with BJP in 2013
 yani pichley 4 saalon se lalu bhi sarkaar se jude rahe hai
 So when Lalu questions the education system of the last decade in Bihar, he puts Nitish's tenure in the dock
 ye digar baat he ki mahagathbandhan ke dedh saal ke arase main lagaataar duusari saal nateezon main ghalmail saamne aayaa he
 How many steps did the government take? In 2016, more than 32 accused were sent to jail after the board scam
 inamen kai ucchadhikari bhi shaamil the
 In addition, the entire board structure was reformed
 is kaam ke liye karodon rupee kharch hue
 Nitish Sarkar appointed IAS Anand Kishore as the Chairman of the Board
 puure board offis main sisitivi camere lagaae gaye
 Hundreds of employees of the board were transferred and many of the education mafia leaders went behind bars
 itnaa hi nahin, saikadon skulon or collejon kii manyata radd kii gai
 But the result turned out to be three parts of Dhaka
 kya batch nikaleen kai badi machhliyaan?jaankaar sawaal puch rahe hai ki board main bade badlaavon ke baad bhi wo skool kaise bache rah gaye jahaan se is saal ke ghotaale ke aropiyon ne pariksha paas kii he
 In the midst of all the measures to stop copying, why has the government not been able to stop the confusions at the time of checking the copies of the north? It is obvious that the constituent parties of the Grand Alliance cannot break all the blame on Nitish Kumar
 jo nitish pichley ek dashak ke dauraan siem the, aaj bhi vahi mukhyamantri hai

 This year has proved to be very successful for Bollywood actor Ayushmann Khurrana
 unki philindhadhunane box offis par shandaar kamai kii
 After this, his low-budget film Badhaai Ho made a splash at the box office
 relies ke 4 hafton se zyada hone ke baad bhi film kii kamai rukne kaa naam nahin le rahi he
 Lead actor Ayushman Khurana has given his response about the film
 pinkavila ko die gaye intervyuu main ayushmaan khurana ne kaha- ''ye saal mere liye ek sapane sareekha rahaa
 As an actor i have always believed that content is the God of cinema
 maine is kism ke ofbeet cinema ko hameshaa tavajjo di he
 Because it seems to me that a content based film is simple and good with entertainment
 ''ayushmaan ne aage kaha- ''meri filmon ko lekar kiye gaye chunaav par logon ne hameshaa sawaal khadey kiye hai
 But i have always trusted my own choice without hearing anyone
 log mujhe sachet karte the ki main stardam game nahin kar rahaa hum or sirf achche content par kaam kar rahaa hum
 Today i feel privileged as an actor who works on a film made on good content and his film also gets success at the box office
 isse ye sabit ho gaya he ki achche content par bani filmon ko vishvabhar main saraahaa jaataa he
 The story of the film is from the Kaushik family of Delhi, where the father (gajraj Rao), mother (neena Gupta) live in the house along with their son Nakul Kaushik (ayushman Khurana)
 nakul ko rene (sanya malhotra) se mohabbat he or donon kaa romance paravaan chadhataa rahata he
 Then there is a sudden earthquake in Nakula's house
 darasal, nakul kii mummy pregnent ho jaati hai or phir kahani main bahut saare utaar chadhaav shuru ho jate hai
 Congratulations Hoka budget was about 20 crores
 iske box offis collection kii baat karen to film ne paanch hafton main 128
 Has earned 40 crores
 relies ke paanchave hafte bhi log ise pasand kar rahe hai
 The film has got a good audience
 film ne paanchave hafte main 8 karod rupye kamaaye hai
 The film made 66 in the first week
 10 karod kii kamai kii thi
 Explain that Congratulations Ho has earned more than 200 crores in terms of worldwide collection
 kya aap aise kisi skool kii kalpana karnaa chahenge, jahaan aapke bachche ko get par metal detector se guzarana pade, classroom main jane se pehle uske bag kii suraksha jaanch ho, prarthana ke baad aatankwaad se bachane ke liye suraksha dril ho, chaaron taraf sisitivi camere lage hon, jiske zariye principal or security afasar bacchon ke ek-ek lamhe par nigaah rakh rahe hon, skool kii deevaaren bahut oonchi or get main gril kii jagah lohe kii moti chadar lagi ho
 If your child spends in a school in this environment, what will be the impact on him, have we thought about it
 vaise bahut had tak ye maahaul hamaare paas ban chukaa he
 Even after this, the psychological impact of such a strict environment of safety on a child must be evaluated
 sirf scalon ko bakhtarband kar dene se haivaaniyat kii bandook ko khatm nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 In 2010, the central government had also sent instructions to all the states what to do for the safety of schools
 tab yah pataa chalaa tha ki mumbai hamale kaa aaropee david kolman hedli ne 2008 ke mumbai hamale se pehle do boarding skulon kii bhi video ricarding kii thi
 The directory states that if a gunman attacks the school, the students and teachers should remain in their respective rooms
 darwaja band kar dena chahie or jameen par let janaa chahie
 The guard must press the alarm button
 aisa karne se andhadhundh golibari se kai logon kii jaan batch sakati he
 But what to do when, like the school in Peshawar, children started being shot after asking their names
 disha nirdesh ko dhyaan se padhein, to lagata he ki ab skool, skool nahin rahenge
 Although schools also work like a state-system, the difference will be that in the name of terror they will be allowed to work like a police system
 jitne bhi nirdesh bataae gaye hai, unamem se ek bhi aatanki hamale ko rokane main kargar nahin he
 Sometimes a mall, sometimes a hotel, sometimes a hospital, sometimes a railway station, sometimes a rally
 har jagah aatankwaadiyon ne nishaanaa banaaya he
 Innocent people are killed
 aap kahaan-kahaan sisitivi ke bharose aatankwaad ko kaabo main rakhenge
 Governments increase the security budget after every terrorist attack in the world
 sarkaar se lekar public sansthaaen arabon rupee electronic upkaran kharidne main kharch kar detii hai
 Thousands of CCTV cameras are being installed in the name of security devices
 itnaa paisa agar ham police system ko behatar karne main kharch karte, to kuch thos nateeja bhi nikalataa
 There is not enough police in the police station
 khufia tantra kamazor padaa hua he
 The police has neither been modernized nor equipped with technical equipment
 sarkarein ye sab karne main barason laga detii he or tab tak bazaar aatank or suraksha ke naam par arabon kaa maal bechakar nikal jaataa he
 Shouldn't it now be analyzed whether metal detectors and CCTV helped in stopping terrorism or not
 aae din ham tivi par dekh rahe hai ki nakaab pahanakar sisitivi camere ke neeche atm mashin tak uthaa le ja rahe hai
 We are not able to catch the thieves from CCTV, what the terrorists will catch
 mumbai hamale ke baad puure desh main sisitivi or metal detector kii bikri bad gai he
 a 'business Standard' newspaper report published in 2008 states that the market for safety equipment is growing at a rate of 30 percent
 sisitivi nigaraanee kii jagah digital nigaraanee kii taraf duniya ja rahi he
 In this system you can monitor your company or school from anywhere in the world with your computer
 guard kii zarurat nahin hogi
 But after watching the CCTV after the attack, if someone tells the police, do we not know what is the condition of our police? digital nigaraanee ke naam par mugalata mat paaliye
 You go somewhere in the town, CCTV cameras are installed in schools
 behad kam tankhwaah par rangeen kapade main sirf chaay par baarah-baahar ghante khadey ye guard tainaat kam, jhulate hue zyada lagate hai
 Go to any station and see
 metal detector kaa kya haal he
 The entire station is open
 jo khatarnaak iraade se aayega uske liye stesan main ghusane ke hazaron raste hai
 After the terrorist attacks in public space, airports have only better protected themselves
 bharat hi nahin shaayad duniya bhar main
 This is because airports have been modernized extensively
 puraane ko todakar nayaa banaaya gaya he
 But railway stations are not built for safety
 hyderabad police ne skulon ke liye suraksha upkarnon kii ek numaaish bhi lagaai
 Told them with a fake blast what happens and what to do
 kuch companiyon ke upkaran bhi vahaan laga diye, jinaki bikri bad jaaegi
 This is also a very aristocratic view of the police and the government
 skulon main suraksha ke naam par ham chand mahanagaron ke nami privet skulon kii dril se santusht nahin ho sakate hai
 There are also government schools in these metros and many very simple government schools
 sarkarein apane skulon main shauchalay nahin banavaa saki hai or ve nirdesh ke naam par upadesh de rahi hai ki aap teen-teen get banavaaiye, sisitivi camere lagaaiye, public anounsament system hona chahie, vagairah-vagairah
 Are government school children not children of this country? zaahir he in aadhe-adhure tareekon se aatankwaad se muqabla nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Will CCTV do it when governments are unable to do so
 isliye aatankwaad ke kaarnon, unki rajnatik dharmik prishthbhumi se takaraana hi hoga
 We also have to deal with the environment that is being created in the public space day and night due to the language of communal and religious fundamentalism
 awwal to ham dharmik kattarta or rashtrawaad ko hi sherbet main chini kii tarah gholkar piiye ja rahe hai bagaiyr yah samajhe ki kattarta kii yahi prishthbhumi kaam aa jaati he aatankwaad ko rachane main
 The Taliban is not just a product of religion
 yah kaise ho saktaa he ki sarkarein taliban ko janm bhi den, unako paale-posen or aam naagarik se kah den ki aap sisitivi laga lijie
 Until we prepare an international opinion against these reasons, this problem will continue to kill any of us
 agar yah baat nahin samaj aati he, to apni kameez ke collar par bhi ek sisitivi camera laga lijie
 Everyone has a camera in their hands
 kya isse aatankwaad ruk jayega
 Just as Rahul Gandhi confirmed on Twitter that he is not a Congress president and would not take part in the selection of his successor, the party fell into more turmoil with a tug of war between older veterans and younger leaders
 congress kaary samiti (seedblusi) july ke aakhir tak agle adhyaksh kaa chayan kar sakati he‚Äîjo congress mahadhiveshan main chayan par aakhri mohar lagane tak asthaayee vyavastha hogi‚Äîaise main is ahm pad ko lekar party main lobying shuru ho gai he
 Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh tweeted on 6 July that the leadership of the party be assigned to a 'youth'
 kai logon ne iskaa arth nikaala ki ve ishaaron main rajasthan ke up-mukhyamantri sachin payalat ko yah jimmedaari saunpane ke liye kah rahe hai
 The pilot is close to Amarinder
 payalat ko rashtriya adhyaksh kii jimmedaari saunpane se rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ke saath chal rahaa unka satta sangharsh bhi khatm ho jayega
 However, after that tweet, a senior CWC member who had spoken to Amarinder claimed that he was referring to a leader in the age of eighty
 haryana ke ek anya bade netaa ne kaha ki amarinder 53 varshiya manish tiwari ke paksh main batting kar rahe the
 The next day in Mumbai, party president Milind Deora and western UP in-charge general secretary Jyotiraditya Scindia resigned
 devda ne yahaan tak kaha ki ve ek rashtriya ohade ke liye taiyaar ho rahe hai
 Many young leaders claim that Rahul Gandhi resigned in the hope that the leaders of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) responsible for the poor performance in the general elections would follow in his footsteps and clear the way for new faces to be brought forward
 25 may ko seedblusi kii baithak main rahul ne gahalot, kamalnath or pi
 Chidambaram was also rebuked for pressuring the party to give tickets to his sons
 ek congress saansad kehete hai ki iske baad bhi puraane diggajon main se kisi ne istipha nahin diya
 According to a CWC member, Deora is eyeing the post of treasurer of the party
 par isaki sambhaavna nahin he ki sonia gandhi yah ohada apane bharosemand ahamed patel ke haathon se phisalane dengi
 Many young leaders feel that Patel acts as a lifelong for the group of old veterans because they are close to Sonia and have a great influence as treasurer
 seedblusi ke unheen sadsy kaa kahana he ki sindhiya ke adhyaksh pad ke sarvasammat ummidavaar ke taur par ubharne kii acchhee sambhaavna he
 He says, "legendary leaders may be persuaded, but Sonia Gandhi would not want any of Rahul's contemporary and contemporary leaders to sit on the highest chair
" ''seedblusi ke sadasyon kii ausat umr 67 saal he or uske zyaadaatar bade sadsy, adhyaksh ke ohade ke liye kam jane-maane bujurg ko tarjeeh de rahe hai, taaki tape-tapaae netaa tab tak party chalaaen jab tak ki use sanbhaalane ke liye gandhi parivaar kaa koi sadsy taiyaar nahin ho jaataa
 They want to avoid repeating the experience of 1991, when p
 ve
 Narasimha Rao soon strengthened his hold over the party and the government and sidelined many veteran leaders
 unke kaarykaal main party do-faad hui or madhavrao sindhiya, arjuna singh or en
 D
 tiwari sareekhe diggaj netaaon ne party chhod di thi
 Treasurer Sitaram Kesari was made the chairman after the Congress's defeat in the 1996 general election
 par 1998 main jab sonia ne party kii kaman sanbhali, tab kesari ko beizzat karke hataa diya gaya
 Since then, the position of president of Congress has remained with the Gandhi family
 1991 kii tarah patel hi nae adhyaksh kii chayan prakriya kii aguai kar rahe hai
 Some veterans preferred Gehlot, but he refused
 aakhir main samjhaute ke taur par purv kendriya mantri mukul vaasanic sambhavit ummidavaar ho sakate hai, jo sitambar main 70 saal ke ho jaaenge
 In these circumstances, an alternative might be to make one veteran leader a temporary president, many youths as vice-presidents, who take independent charge of the areas or branches of the organization
 yaa ek asthaayee adhyaksh niyukt kiya jaae jo seedblusi kii chuni hui ek kor cameti ke prati javabdeh ho‚Äîmagar iske liye party ke samvidhan main sanshodhan karnaa hoga
 Sonia will take the final decision
 or pichley record ko dekhte hue sabase zyada sambhaavna isi baat kii he ki ve pradarshan ke bajaae vafadari ko chunegi

 On the other hand, Ayushmann Khurrana starrer film Andhaadhun with a budget of 25 crores has benefited and the audience is still going to theaters to watch it
 lavayatri kii baat karen to pehla haftaa puraa hone ke baad film ne takreeban 28 karod rupee kii kamai kar lee he
 According to an estimate, the film's lifetime collection can be up to 50 crores
 baat karensalmaan khanproductions kii film lavaratri kii to yah box offis par aundhe munh giri he
 The film has grossed only 10 crores in the first week
 aayush sharmaaki yah debyue bollywood film thi or iskaa flop hona jaahir taur par unke kariyar ko bhi prabhavit karegaa
 The second week may be lighter for both these films
 aisa isliye kyonki is hafte relies huintumbad, helicopter ila or fraide ab pichley hafte relies hui filmon ko chunauti dengi
 Though none of these films are of very big budget, but one of the disadvantages of having more films at the box office is that the profit starts to be distributed among all the films
 dilli kii aam aadmi party sarkaar main swasthya mantri satyendra jain kii beti ko mohalla clinics main salaahkaar banane par raajnneetik bavaal khadaa ho gaya he
 Questioning the appointment made in a secret manner, the opposition has accused the Kejriwal government of familism

 maamla beti kaa tha to swasthya mantri satyendra jain ne safai dene main jaraa bhi deree nahin kii
 The issue got to the opposition
 The Aam Aadmi Party government has also held its workers and close positions in important positions earlier

 This is the reason why the post of the daughter of the minister is considered very important
 haryana main congress ke sabase varisht netaa or do baar mukhyamantri rah chuke bhupendra singh hooda is baar sonipat se loksabhaa chunaav lard rahe hai
 Sonipat is a Jat dominated seat
 yahi vajah he ki congress alaakaman ne bhupendra hooda ko sonipat jitaane kii jimmedaari saunpi he
 Bhupendra Hooda's direct fight is with bjp's sitting MP Ramesh Chand Kaushik, whom BJP has fielded again

 Even though Exit Polls seem limited to the victory and defeat of political parties only
 par shuruaati daur main inkaa aisa istemaal nahin hota tha
 Rather, these journalists were also tools for the fraternity to sift the pulse of the public on various issues
 agsit pole ko shuru karne kaa shrey jorge galop or claude robinson ko jaataa he
 Actually, George and Robinson tried to get the opinion of the American people on the functioning of the government
 jisamen unhone paaya ki sample or rigelt main zyada antar nahin tha
 People's opinion was seen on that issue more or less
 unka yah tarika kaaphi femes hua
 Seeing this, Britain and France also adopted it
 ek tarah se yah pehla agsit pole tha jise britain or france ne pehali baar 1937 or 1938 main apanaaya tha
 The results of the elections held at that time were more or less accurate
 jabaki mul rup se agsit pole shuru karne kaa shrey netherland ke samajashastri marcel won ko jaataa he
 Marcel von first used it in the Dutch assembly election on 15 February 1967

 His assessment was accurate in the election held in the Netherlands
 haalanki kuch strot america janamat surveykshak Warren Mitofsky ko agsit pole kaa janak maanate hai
 When the exit poll was started in India in 1960, the exit poll blueprint was drawn in 1960
 ise centre for da study of develping societies (CSDS) ne taiyaar kiya tha
 But in the mid-80s, Prannoy Roy, a chartered accountant-turned-journalist at the time, tried to sway the pulse of voters
 yaheen se bharat main agsit pole shuru hue, aisa mana jaataa he
 All the exit polls in the initial period were prominently featured in India Today magazine
 yah silsilaa ab bhi jari he
 Lok Sabha Elections 2019: Know what the exit polls are, how the figures are released, the exit polls of the Lok Sabha elections in 1996 gave new dimensions
 doordarshan ne 1996 main siesds ko desh bhar main agsit pole kii anumati de di
 In the exit poll conducted by CSDS, no party could get a majority
 is chunaav main bhartiya janata party (BJP) sabase badi party banakar ubhari thi, lekin bahumat hasil nahin kar paayi thi
 The result was that the Atal government fell in just 13 days
 iske baad echdi devegoda or indra kumaar gujral ne milakar upie kii sarkaar banaai
 After this, exit polls in the 1998 Lok Sabha elections were published in most news channels
 is chunaav main chaar badi chunavi survey karne vaali agenciyaan jaise India Today / CSDS, DRS, Outlook / AC Nielsen or Frontline / CMS apane survey main neshnal democratic elliance (NDA) ko badi party rup main darshaya tha, lekin bahumat dur rakhaa tha
 When all the parties turned against exit polls, these opinion polls became popular in the early days, but they also started to wink in the eyes of political parties
 lihaaja sabhi dal sur main sur milakar is par pratibandh lagane kii maang karne lage
 On which, in 1999, the Election Commission, under an executive order, banned the opinion poll and exit poll
 jiske khilaaf ek samachar patr ne ayog ke is aadesh ko supreme court main chunauti bhi di thi
 The court quashed the order, stating that the Commission did not have the power to issue such orders and an all-party consensus on any issue does not form the basis of legal sanctions against it
 kuch pherbadal ke saath phir shuru hue agsit pole2009 loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle ek baar phir agsit pole ko bain karne kii maang uthi
 On which the Election Commission wrote a letter to the Law Ministry to immediately bring an ordinance to change the law in the context of the ban
 2009 main congress nit upie sarkaar ne janpratinidhitiv kanoon, 1951 main sanshodhan kiya
 According to the amended law, exit polls cannot be shown until the final vote is taken during the electoral process
 is kanoon ke anusaar kisi bhi madhyam se koi bhi pole ke nateezon ko na to dikhaa saktaa he or na hi prakashit kar saktaa he
 After the exit poll, now the sword of ban on opinion polls also hangs
 Exit Poll 2019: loksabhaa chunaav main jaane agsit pole yaa post pole, koun sateek or bharosemand?kin-kin deshon main hote hai agsit pole?duniya ke kai loktantric deshon kaa agsit pole ko lekar alag-alag mat he
 Some justify it and some justify it
 belgium, denmark, germany or ireland jaise deshon main agsit pole karne ko khuli chhot he jabaki china, dakshin korea or mexico main kuch sharton ke saath agsit pole kii ijaajat he
 Do Exit Polls Affect Voters? There is no opinion of experts from all over the world on this plea
 kuch log ise sire khaarij karte hai to kuch kaa maananaa he ki matadaataaon par asar padane se pratibandh lagaana thik nahin he
 An extensive research was done on this by renowned economist and Mansa Pathanam of CREST institute of France
 'larning from eczit pols in sikvential electionsah evidence fram e policy experement in india' naam se prakashit 60 pej ke is shodh patr main eczit pole ke asar se matadaataaon ke vyavhaar main dikhe badlaav kii padtaal kii gai he
 It found that around 20 per cent of the voters who came to vote during the last hours voted in favor of the parties who took the lead in exit polls in the initial order of voting
 mukesh ambani kii aguwai vali company reliance jeeyo ne department of telecom (dot) ko likhe letters main aarope lagaaya he ki uski pratidwandvi airtel dwaara tikona ke prastaavit adhigrahan saude se sarkaar ko 217 karod rupee kaa nuksaan hoga
 However, Bharti Airtel has denied these allegations
 jeeyo ne kaha ki yadi internet sarvice prowider ke paas maujuud spectrum kaa istemaalwais kol karneke liye kiya jayega, to isse sarkaar ko ghaataa hoga
 Jio has demanded the dot not to approve the acquisition deal until Airtel pays for converting broadband spectrum from ISP license to Unified license
 iske baad spectrum kaa istemaal kisi bhi uddeshy ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 In a three-page letter, Jio has also asked it to refund the Rs 1,658 crore fee it incurred in 2013 for converting its broadband spectrum into a unified license
 iske alaava aapako ye bhi bataa den ki, jeeyo telecom sector main dhooma machaane ke baad aapako hai speed vaai-faai sarvice bhi dene ja rahaa he

 Avoiding any comparison, former captain Sourav Ganguly said that current captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has done wonders in Indian cricket and he is ready to lead the team in the 2015 World Cup
 captain kool dhoni ek baar phir ummiido par khare utre jab ravivaar ko team ne unki aguwai main isisi champions trophy kaa khitaab jeeta
 Ganguly said, 'dhoni is an extraordinary captain
 uskaa record bejod he
 There is still a lot of cricket left in him and he has done wonders in Indian cricket
 ‚Äôganguli ne kaha, ‚Äòdhoni khilaadiyon kaa bhi samarthan karata he
 He has developed players like Suresh Raina, Ravindra Jadeja and Rohit Sharma under his leadership and has some outstanding qualities as captain
 ‚Äôdhoni ke liye champions trophy jeetna us shandaar yatra kaa samaapan he jisaki shuruyaat 2007 main tii20 vishwa cap main jeet ke saath hui thi
 India also won the 2011 World Cup under his captaincy and also became the world's number one team in odis and Tests during this period
 duniya ke kisi or captain ne antarrashtriya cricket main isisi kii teen badi trophy nahin jiti he
 When asked about the next 50-over World Cup, Ganguly said, "I am sure that the 2015 World Cup is on his mind
 vah yuva or shandaar vanade khilaadi he or aisa koi kaaran nahin he ki vah captain nahin ho
 The comparison between Ganguly and Dhoni, popularly known as 'prince of Calcutta', has dented the newspaper, but the former Indian captain did not pay much attention to it
 ganguli ne kaha, ‚Äòmujhe samaj main nahin aata ki log meri or dhoni kii tulana kyon karte hai
 i feel that it is not possible for me to compare myself to Dhoni

 kapil ne kaha ki team ke senior khilaadiyon main jazbe kii kami he
 Kapil was referring to players like Captain Dhoni and Sachin Tendulkar
 kapil ke mutabik khilaadiyon ne ek team kii tarah nahin khelaa
 There is no one to blame but the team is playing more cricket than necessary
 world cap jeetne ke 4 din baad hi ipel shuru ho gaya phir westeindies or ab england in sabase khilaadiyon kii maansikta par asar padaa
 You must have heard a lot about the husband torturing his wife, but have you ever heard any husband openly saying that his wife tortures him? Or that a man is a victim of female harassment? Even if a large number of men inside the house accept it, the initiative to raise this voice on the road has taken place in UP
 ho saktaa he yah sab aapako akshay kumaar-priyanka chopra kii film 'etraj' kii kahani lag rahi ho, lekin yah kahani filmi parde se itar asal jindagi kii he
 In Uttar Pradesh, such men harassed by their wives and women have formed an organization, which has been named the 'collision of Men'
 purushon ke is sanghathan kii maang he ki neshnal kamishan four vuman kii tarj par neshnal kamishan four main kaa bhi gathan kiya jaae
 And it involves justice to men who are harassed by women
 sanghathan kamishan ke madhyam se un logon kii madad kii maang bhi kar rahaa he, jinhen mahila suraksha ke liye banaae gaye kanoon ke tahat galat cese main fansaaya gaya he
 Otherwise, after the success of Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi, this organization of men has warned political parties in the state
 sanghathan kii maang he sabhi raajnneetik partiyaan purushon ke liye kamishan kii maang ko apane ellection menifesto main shaamil kare
 The organization has warned the parties in this regard that if they do not do so, they will form their own party and stand for their candidates in the elections
 khaas baat yah he ki ab tak 'colision of main' naam ke is sanghathan se 50 se adhik sanghathan jud gaye hai, jinamein kai enjio or soshal varkar shaamil hai
 Clearly, this has become a new problem for political parties in UP just before the elections
 'colision of main' ke sadsy indu subhash kehete hai, 'hamane apni maangon ko lekar pradarshan se lekar public meeting tak sabakuch kiya, lekin hamen koi laabh nahin mila
 In such a situation, we have now turned to political parties
 agar ve apane menifesto main purushon ke liye kamishan kii maang shaamil nahin karte hai to march-april main ham apni party launch kar denge
 '94 percent of dowry torture cases are wrong, says another member of the organization, RK Verma,' The Supreme Court also says that 94 percent of the cases filed under dowry torture are wrong
 kanoon banane waalon ko yah samajhnaa chahie ki vot kii khatir hamane jo niyam banaae hai vah thik nahin he
 In such a situation, political parties will have to accept our demand
 '
 
 
 This party of support men will do to the party says that whichever party will include the demand of National Commission in its manifesto, the organization and its members will get full support of that party
 sanghathan kaa kahana he ki mahilaon kii suraksha ko lekar jo niyam banaae gaye hai, vah apni jagah thik ho sakate hai
 But due to this a kind of prejudice has come in the society
 galat maamalon main bhi yahaan purushon ko turant gunahagaar maan liya jaataa he phir chaahe vah nirdosh hi kyon naa ho
 The organization claims that so far there are more than 1 crore men who have been falsely implicated in dowry harassment and all such cases

 During this time Modi claimed permanent membership in the UN Security Council

 India's Right to Permanent Membership of United Nations Security Council: Narendra Modi Prime Minister Narendra Modi has once again strongly advocated giving India permanent membership in the United Nations Security Council

 In his last public address on the visit to France, Modi referred to the martyrdom of Indian soldiers in World War i and World War II and his contribution to peace programs at the international level and called for permanent membership in the UN Security Council, calling it 'right of India'
 PM modi ne france main bharatiyon ke bich kii koyala ghotaale kii charchafrance ke paris shahar main pradhanmantri narend modi ne shanivaar ko bhartiya samudaay ke logon ko sambodhit kiya

 Information about an interesting meeting is coming during the 'BRICS Summit'
 nepal media ne report kiya he ki nepali pradhanmantri pushp camel dahal or chini raashtrapati shi jinping kii mulaakaat ke dauraan pradhanmantri modi bhi vahaan pahunche or donon se kuch der tak baatcheet kii
 The comments sutron ke mutabik, yah koi aupchaarik tripaksheeya baithak nahin thi
 Prime Minister Modi met Dahal and Xi when both of them were in the lounge of Hotel Taj Exotica
 bharat ke videsh mantralay ne ab tak is mulaaqaat par kuch nahin kaha he
 The meeting on Saturday night lasted for about 20 minutes
 nepali media main chhapi is mulaakaat kii tasviir main dahal kii patni sita dahal bhi netaaon ke saath baithi nazar aa rahi hai
 According to a Nepali media report, Dahal has spoken to Modi and Xi that Nepal is in the middle of two major powers in the region and that Nepal cannot get progress and prosperity without further cooperation from both
 gauratlab he ki nepal or china ke bich dwipaksheeya mulaaqaat bahut pehle hi tay ho chukaa thi or iskaa elaan bhi kiya ja chukaa tha, lekin isamen bharat ke pradhanmantri kisi bhi rup main hissaa lenge is baat kii koi jaankaree nahin di gai thi
 The relationship between Nepal and India has seen many ups and downs in recent times
 khaastaur par pichley pradhanmantri capi oli ke kaarykaal ke dauraan nepal ke nae samvidhan ko lagu karne ko lekar vahaan ke madheshiyon main kaaphi naaraazgi dekhi gai
 Due to this movement, supplies from India to Nepal were halted
 nepal ne iske peeche bharat sarkaar kaa haath mana tha
 However, the relationship has come back on track after Prachanda came to power
 prachand ne pradhanmantri kaa pad sanbhaalane ke baad apni pehali videsh yatra ke liye bharat ko chunaa
 This led to the message that Nepal had balanced its inclination towards China, but Prachanda's decision to come to India annoyed China so much that Xi's proposed visit to Nepal was postponed, although it was said on behalf of China As to where the question of postponement arises when there was no formal announcement of the tour
 yah bhi mana ja rahaa he ki china ke van belt van road project par apni sahmati dene main nepal kii taraf se kii ja rahi deree bhi china kii naaraazgi kii vajah rahi
 India as well as China offered a greater role in Nepal's reconstruction after the devastating earthquake last year
 nepal ko bhi in donon kii zarurat he isliye mana ja rahaa he ki prachand ne is mulaaqaat ke dauraan donon deshon ko saadhane kii koshish kii, haalanki china kii koshish nepal main lagaataar apane prabhaav ko badhaane kii he jabaki nepal main china ke prabhaav ko lekar bharat kii apni chintaaen rahi hai isliye teen netaaon kii is mulaakaat ko teenon deshon ke apane-apane hit ke nazariye se dekha ja rahaa he
 According to sources, this was not a formal tripartite meeting
 pradhanmantri modi dahal or shi se tab mili jab ye donon hotel taj akzotica ke lounj main the
 India's Foreign Ministry has not said anything on this meeting so far
 shanivaar raat ko hui yah mulaakaat kareeb 20 minute tak chali
 Dahal's wife Sita Dahal is also seen sitting with the leaders in the photo of this meeting published in Nepali media
 nepali media report ke mutabik, dahal ne modi or shi se mukhaatib hote hue yah kaha ki nepal is kshetra kii do badi taaqaton ke bich main he or donon se saath or sahyog ke bina nepal ko tarakkee or khushhaali nahin mil sakati
 Significantly, the bilateral meeting between Nepal and China was decided long ago and it was also announced, but no information was given that the Prime Minister of India will participate in any form
 nepal or bharat ke sambandh ne haal ke samay main kai utaar-chadhaav dekhe hai
 Particularly during the tenure of the previous Prime Minister KP Oli, there was considerable resentment among the Madheshis of Nepal for implementing the new constitution
 ise lekar hue andolan ke chalate bharat se nepal ko jane vaali supplai ruk-si gai
 Nepal had considered the hand of the Indian government behind this
 haalanki prachand ke satta main aane ke baad rishte patari par laute hai
 Prachanda chose India for his first foreign trip after assuming the office of Prime Minister
 isse yah sandesh gaya ki nepal ne china ke prati apane jhukaav ko santulit kar liya he, lekin prachand ke bharat aane ke faisle se china itnaa naaraaz hua ki shi kii prastaavit nepal yatra ko sthagit kar diya gaya, haalanki china kii taraf se yah kaha gaya ki jab daure kaa koi aupchaarik elaan hi nahin hua tha to sthagit karne kaa sawaal kahaan uthta he
 It is also believed that the delay by Nepal in giving its consent to China's One Belt One Road project was also the reason for China's displeasure
 pichley saal aae vinaashkari bukamp ke baad nepal ke purnirmaan main bharat ke saath-saath china ne bhi apni badi bhoomika kii peshkash kii
 Nepal also needs both of them, so Prachanda is believed to have tried to strengthen both the countries during this meeting, although China is constantly trying to increase its influence in Nepal, while India is concerned about China's influence in Nepal
 The three leaders have been having their concerns so this meeting of the three leaders is being seen from the perspective of their respective interests of the three countries

 Just getting a new job should not be your last motive
 jaaniye ki naukari shuru karne se pehle aapako kin-kin baton kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie, jo aapke kal main kaam aaengi
 Ask about your work again and again
 Before joining the job, you should know what is your work and what used to be there before you
 saath hi aapse kis tarah kii ummid kii ja rahi he
 Refuse if 
 
 1
 If your work has been changed
 2
 If you have not been told much about work
 3
 If you have not been told what to expect from you? Ask about the working hours and weekly holidays
 Be sure to find out about your working hours, weekly holidays and holidays between the necessary conversations
 iske alaava yah bhi ki vahaan atirikt kaam kitna karnaa hoga
 Refuse if 
 
 1
 If you are not told clearly about your working hours
 2
 If you are told that 'here salary is paid only for work'
 3
 When the boss tells you that he is very crazy about work
 company culture ke bare main pataa karanjab aap company main intervyuu or screening ke liye ja rahe hai, to gaur se dekhie vahaan kaa kaam kaa maahaul kaisaa he? us team main kaam karne vaale log khush he ki nahin?manaa kar den agar

 3
 agar aapako us samay intervyuu yaa kaam se sambandhit mail milen, jo kaayade se sahi nahin he
 Know about the team's business, this method tells a lot about the team's environment
 agar aapako sidhi jaankaree nahin mil rahi he to team kitni puraani he is bare main pataa karen
 Refuse if 
 1
 agar aap lambey samay baad naukari badalane ja rahe hai

 agar saileri or notice kii baat par bos ne aapke saath sahi dhang se baatcheet nahin kii ho
 2
 agar aapaki kshamtaaon par sawaal uthaaya gaya he
 Think for yourself what to do next? Not every job can be perfect and good

 com Designer Anju Modi, through his collection at the 'blenders Pride Fashion Tour 2015' in Gurgaon on Saturday, presented a picture of the grandeur of Bajirao Mastani's era in such a way that people kept looking
 'divaani mastaani' main apni glamras luk ko lekar pehle se hi charchaa main deepika ramp par phulon ke print vaale laal lahange or khubasurat dupattey main har tarah se shahi lag rahi thim
 Deepika said, i started my career with this fashion tour
 apni luk ke bare main deepika ne kaha- kisi bhi kirdaar ko sajiv banane main styling kii bhoomika mahatvapurn he
 From the director's vision to the entire team's contribution
 anju modi ne kaha, maine paridhaanon ke madhyam se us daur ko phir se banaaya he
 This was challenging due to the extremely limited reference material
 yah fishan tour mumbai, haidarabad or kolkata kii bhi yatra karegaa
 Whether or not actor Salman Khan will be able to do Boney Kapoor's 'no Entry in Entry' is difficult to say, as Salman is very busy with the rest of his projects right now
 saal 2005 main ai film 'no entry' ne acha bijness kiya tha or ab is film kaa sikval 'no entry main entry' banane kii khabar he
 But Salman, who has played an important role in the film 'no Entry', will also be a part of its sequel, it is not yet decided
 filmkarboni kapoor angreji akhbaar 'diene' se baat karte hue kaha, 'meri script puri tarah se taiyaar he lekin salmaan khan kii taraf se abhi tak koi signal nahin aayaa he, ab wo film karenge yaa nahin iskaa jawaab aapako salmaan hi de sakate hai
 'actually Salman Khan's reason for not reacting to this film is being told his busy schedule
 salmaan khan in dinon kabir khan kii 'bajrangi bhaijan' main vyast hai jo id ko relies hogi
 Apart from this, Salman is going to be a part of Suraj Barjatya's film 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo' after a long time
 yah film 11 navambar ko relies hogi
 Salman Khan has to finish shooting for 'sultan' and 'kick 2' as well
 biji shedul ke chalate hi pichley dinon salmaan karan johar kii'shuddhi'ko naa kah chuke hai
 In such a situation, it seems very difficult to do Salman's entry in 'no Entry'
 apni najarbandi se thik pehle hafiz said ne soshal media ke jariye ek bayaan jari kiya
 In this, he is telling the friendly relationship between India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the new President of America, Donald Trump, for his arrest

 The result of India's efforts is that first lashkar-e-taiba then jamaat-ud-dawa was banned
 is baar nayaa he ki america main satta parivartan ke baad sakhti kaa yah nayaa sandesh he
 According to the information received, on January 20, before Trump formally assumed power, the US started pressuring Pakistan
 janvari ke duusare hafte main america ke assistant secretary of state ne pakistani rajdoot jaleel abbaas jilani se mulaaqaat kar aatankwaad ke khilaaf kathor qadam uthaane ko kaha

 epiji kii tazaa report main jamaad-ud-daawa ke vittiya len dein or gatividhiyon par gambhir sawaal uthaae gaye hai
 The Pakistani media also confirms that by showing this report, the US has bluntly told Pakistan that Pakistan can be banned if proper action is not taken
 iske baad pakistan ko har antarrashtriya vittiya len dein ke liye sambandhit antarrashtriya vittiya sansthaanon se manzuri lene kii naubat aa jaaegi

 america ke is kade rukh ke baad pakistan kii sarkaar or sena ne aapas main salaah mashvira kiya
 Several rounds of meetings were held between the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Finance and National Security Advisers
 iske baad sarkari aadesh ke zarie haafiz said ko chaar or saathiyon ke saath nazarband karne kaa faisla liya gaya
 The arrest and detention of Hafiz Saeed has happened many times before, but the government of Pakistan has not been able to present any concrete evidence against him in the court
 vah bhi tab jab mumbai hamale maamle main bharat ne dogier bhar-bharkar pakistan ko saboot die hai
 Through the government order, Zakiurrahman Lakhvi was not able to keep Pakistan inside for a long time, so once again Daromdar is on the government of Pakistan how to keep the evidence of Saeed's crimes in the court and punish him once again
 Through mere detention, India and America tries to throw dust in the eyes of the entire world including

 This surprising case is of Global Complex of Virar

 He told the neighbor that he was going to Nashik for the Shraddha method
 arnala police thane ke police nireekshak rakesh pagaare ke mutabik jaanch main pataa chalaa he ki wo nasik naa jaakar surat gayi
 One mobile he sold at Nalasopara and 3 mobiles at Janata Bazaar in Surat

 Is there a reason for resentment? According to wife Sangeeta, her husband never mentioned this
 pehali najar main bhale kisi anhoni kii ashanka lagati he lekin police jaanch main jo baaten ab tak saamne ai hai usase kahani main pench he
 Because the investigation has revealed that before leaving on October 15, he had also sold the fridge and gym items of the house and the house he lived in is also rented

 They have a daughter at home
 naaraazgi kii vajah kahin beti hona to nahin? patni sangeeta ke mutabik unke pati ne kabhi is baat kaa zikr nahin kiya tha
 At first glance, there may be the possibility of something untoward, but the things that have come out in the police investigation so far have a screw in the story
 kyonki jaanch main pataa chalaa he ki 15 oktober ko jane ke pehle unhone ghar kaa frij or gym kaa saamaan bhi bech diya tha or jis ghar main rahete the wo bhi kiraaye kaa he

 The statement issued by the Madhya Pradesh Police on Saturday raises questions about the intention of the police, because the statement of accused Mihir given to STF till date has clearly written that Mihir asked former union chief Sudarshan to pass the exam
 He was asked to plead and after that Sudarshan ji spoke to the then Education Minister of Madhya Pradesh Laxmikant Sharma
 vahiin madhyapradesh police ne jo bayaan jari kiya he usamen soni or sudarshan ko bedaag qaraar de diya gaya he
 The statement of Madhya Pradesh Police has clearly stated that adding the names of Sudarshan and Suresh Soni in the Vyapam scam is baseless, media speculation
 aapako bataa den ki in netaaon kaa naam kisi or ne nahin ghotaale ke ek aaropee mihir ne liya tha
 Many questions have arisen from the haste in which MP police gave a clean chit to these leaders
 estf ko die bayaan main ghotaale ke ek aaropee mihir ne mana tha ki uske sangh ke netaaon se gahare tallukaat hai or wo suresh soni kaa aadmi he
 Mihir had also named Sudarshan along with Suresh Soni in a statement to STF
 udhar aaropon main ghire sangh netaa suresh soni kaa kahana he ki is maamle par media trial band ho
 Suresh Soni believes that there is a political conspiracy against him
 sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat se jab poocha gaya to unka sirf yahi kahana tha ki kanoon apana kaam karegaa
 The question arises that when the accused in the scam is taking the name of the Sangh leaders in front of the STF, then why not give them a clean chit without investigating the whole case? In the Vyapam scam, the Congress has also dragged the Chief Minister of the state Shivraj Singh Chauhan and his relatives and Now two big leaders of the Sangh are surrounded by questions
 lekin madhyapradesh police ne jis jaldbaaji main donon ko clin chit di he us par sawaal uthanaa lajimi he

 Harbhajan Singh has completed 400 wickets in Test cricket
 unka 400waan shikaar bane carlton bow
 Before this Test, Harbhajan had 398 wickets, but after lunch on Thursday, he did this by taking two quick wickets
 iske saath hi 400 wicket lene vaale tisare bhartiya ban gayi hai
 If the occasion is special, the celebration should also be special, then Bhajji celebrated the heart openly
 jashn manaane kii ek nahin do-do vajahe hai
 He got this success just one day before his 31st birthday
 yun to bhajji ke naam kaa jaadu pichley das saal se chal rahaa he lekin is kamyaabi ne sahi myne main is singh ko king bana diya he
 Because this is the place that has been destined to few bowlers of the world till now
 khaskar bharat main aisa karnama karne vaale bhajji sirf tisare gendbaaz hai
 Before Bhajji, only Kapil and Kumble could do this feat
 bhajji ne apane parakram se apana naam in diggazon kii list main shaamil kara liya he
 Bhajji is also ahead of Kapil Dev in one case
 kapil ne 115 test maichon main ye 400 kaa aankada chuaa, bhajji ne ye karnama 96 test maichon main hi kar dikhaaya
 In this case, only Kumble is faster than Bhajji
 bhajji shaayad kumble se bhi zyada tej sabit hue hote agar 2006 or 2007 main unka kharaab daur nahin aayaa hota
 Well Bhajji is just 31 and he will get plenty of opportunities to prove himself to be the best
 aisa isliye bhi wicket lene kii unki bhukh or raftaar badhati hi ja rahi he
 He has taken just 24 Tests to take 301 to 400 wickets
 yani shikaar karne kaa lutf wo pehle bhi kahin zyada uthaa rahe hai
 Not only this, Bhajji's dominance has increased on foreign land too, now he is playing like a strike bowler, not like a support bowler
 ab wo pich kii parvaah kiye bagaiyr tabadatod hamale kar rahe hai
 This change in thinking and manner will make his journey more spectacular

 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi has been declared its prime ministerial candidate by the Bharatiya Janata Party
 aise main kaha ja rahaa tha ki ab narendra modi gujarat main ek up-mukhyamantri banaaya jayega
 But, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party have made it clear that no deputy chief minister will be appointed in the state
 kaha ja rahaa he ki aise kisi bhi kadam se rajya main modi ke liye samasya paidaa ho sakati he
 Modi's adversary had predicted that when Modi was given such a big responsibility, then a Deputy Chief Minister should be appointed to lighten the workload of the state
 party or aresas ko yah lagata he ki up-mukhyamantri banaae jane se mukhyamantri narendra modi kii dikkatein bad sakati hai
 It is believed that the creation of a Deputy Chief Minister can create two centers of power and the administration as well as the politics can face problems for the party
 gauratlab he ki kuch din purv narendra modi ne ek kaarykram main kaha tha ki vah rajya kii seva hi karnaa pasand karenge
 Based on this, now the RSS and BJP President Rajnath Singh are saying that Modi will continue to serve the state till the next general elections
 tippaniyan It is a matter of fact that Modi had made the party the chairman of the party's election committee for the 2014 general election in Goa session, now Modi will resign from this post
 party ke is elaan ke baad party ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ne party main sabhi padon se istipha de diya tha
 Later, after persuading RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, Advani withdrew his resignation
 haal main bhi party ne modi ko jab piem pratyaashee banaae jane kaa man banaaya tha, tab bhi adwani ne party ke bheetar iskaa tikhaa virodh kiya tha, lekin party ne inke virodh ko darkinar kar diya

 modi ke virdohi ne is baat kaa andeshaa jataayaa tha ki jab modi ko itani badi jimmedaari de di gai he, tab rajya ke kaarybhaar ko halkaa karne ke liye ek up-mukhyamantri banaaya janaa chahie
 The party and RSS feel that Chief Minister Narendra Modi's problems may increase with the appointment of Deputy Chief Minister
 mana ja rahaa he ki up-mukhyamantri banaae jane se satta ke do centre ban sakate hai or prashasan ke saath-saath raajnneeti main bhi party ke liye samasya aa sakati he
 Significantly, a few days ago Narendra Modi had said in a program that he would prefer to serve the state
 isi baat ko aadhaar banaakar ab aresas or bhaajapa adhyaksh rajnath singh kah rahe hai ki modi rajya kii seva agle aam chunaavon tak karte rahenge
 The comments yah baat jarur he ki modi ko party ne goa adhiveshan main 2014 aam chunaav ke liye party kii chunavi samiti kaa adhyaksh banaaya tha, ab modi is pad se istipha de denge
 After this announcement of the party, senior party leader LK Advani resigned from all posts in the party
 baad main aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ke manaane ke baad adwani ne apana istipha waapas liya
 Even recently, when the party had decided to make Modi the PM candidate, Advani had strongly opposed it within the party, but the party brushed aside his opposition

 According to the family, the woman was brought to the hospital in the condition of being shot, but doctors refused to treat her

 On the other hand, on giving information to the police, the police continued to delay in taking action in this whole case by telling the matter from one station to another
 chunaav ho or upi main bahubaliyon kaa zikr na ho aisa kaise ho saktaa he
 This time many Bahubali leaders are not contesting in Purvanchal but there is a discussion that Bahubali leader and former MP Dhananjay Singh can once again contest from Jaunpur seat
 dhananjay singh endie kii ore se is seat par chunaav lard sakate hai
 On Thursday, he can contest from Jaunpur seat on Nishaad party ticket in NDA
 haalanki nishad party ko kitni siten milengi iskaa abhi faisla nahin hua he or na hi koi kuch bhi khulkar bolne ko taiyaar he
 In the Grand Alliance, this seat is still entangled in the account of the BSP
 jonpur seat par pichhali baar modi lahar main bijepi ummidavaar ke pi singh ne sabko chaunkaate hue jeet hasil kii thi
 BJP wants to capture this seat this time too, but so far the party has not announced the name of any candidate on this seat
 vahiin jonpur jile kii duusari surakshit loksabhaa seat machhlishahar par bijepi ne bada daanv khelaa he
 From here, the BJP has made BP Saroj a candidate after cutting the ticket of its sitting MP a few days ago
 iske baad ab jonpur seat par sabaki najare hai
 Dhananjay Singh can get this party with Bahubali leader Dhananjay Singh of East Zone first came to Lok Sabha in 2009 by winning on BSP ticket
 2014 main dhananjay singh nirdaleey chunaav lade lekin modi lahar main vah chunaav haar gaye
 Once again, Dhananjay Singh is preparing to contest the election but this time he does not want to contest as an independent
 dhananjay singh kii bijepi main sidhe entry mushkil he aise main vah nishad party ke jariye endie ummidavaar ke taur par chunaav ladane kii taiyaari main he
 It is being told that BJP can give the seat of Jaunpur and Bhadohi of UP to the Nishad Party included in the NDA
 jonpur seat par rajput, kevat or yadavon kii votaron kii kaaphi taadaad he
 The BJP has changed the seat of sitting MP Birendra Singh Mast on Bhadohi seat
 party ne unhen ab baliya se maujuuda saansad bharat singh kaa tikat katkar ummidavaar banaaya he
 After Birendra Singh Mast was sent to another Lok Sabha constituency, there is a lot of discussion that BJP can give this seat to its ally Nishad Party
 iske saath hi bijepi jonpur seat bhi nishad party ko de sakati he
 It is not easy for the BJP, this time Jaunpur seat has been such a seat for the last several Lok Sabha elections that the BJP and Congress have to struggle a lot to win
 2014 main bijepi ne is seat par modi lahar main jeet hasil kar lee lekin 2019 main halaat aise nahin he
 This time, both the SP and BSP parties have come together and the bjp's path to this seat is not easy after the votes of both these parties merge
 abhi tak yahaan bijepi, bispi or espi main trikoniya muqabla hota rahaa he, bijepi aise main apane sahyogi dal nishad party ke sahare dhananjay singh par daanv laga sakati he
 In the SP-BSP too, this seat has come in the account of the BSP in the confusion regarding this seat, but there is talk of exchange of seats between the two parties
 sapa sangrakshak mulaayam singh yadav lagaataar parasnath yadav ko tikat dene kaa dabaav akhilesh yadav par bana rahe hai
 BSP is ready to change Jaunpur seat from SP to Ballia seat but Akhilesh Yadav is also confused about that seat
 baliya loksabhaa seat par purv pradhanmantri chandrasekhar ke bete niraj shekhar daavedaar hai or purv main vah is seat se saansad bhi rah chuke hai
 The BSP was second in the 2014 elections and the margin of defeat and victory was around 1
5 lakh votes
 yahaan se espi ke parasnath yadav tisare sthaan par the or unhen ek lakh 80 hajaar vot mili the
 However, it has been decided that this time there will be a grand alliance candidate on the SP ticket in Jaunpur seat
 ek nae shodh main pataa chalaa he ki purush kabhi bhi mahilaon ke sirf dost nahin ho sakate
 Researchers say that man's friendship with women is only due to sexual intercourse
 daily mail kii report ke anusaar, duusari taraf mahilaayein purushon ke saath dosti ko nishkaam bhav se leti hai
 She expects more from them only when their own relationship is in trouble
 1989 kii hollywood film ‚Äòwhen harry met style‚Äô bhi isi baat ko bataati he
 Billy Crystal, who plays Harry in the film, tells Meg Ryan in the style role, "men and women can never be friends because there is some part of sex in this relationship
" ‚Äôis surveykshan main 88 yuva jodon ko shaamil kiya gaya tha
 The research showed a greater tendency for males to be attracted to female friends whether they were in a relationship with someone or not
 jabaki pehle se hi kisi purush ke saath rishte main bandhi mahila or ek akeli mahila main bhi purush mitron ke prati aaksharn kaa yahi str dekha gaya
 But a woman living in a relationship is attracted to a male friend only when her own relationship is in difficulty
 zyaadaatar mahilaayein vaise purushon main kam hi ruchi leti hai jo pehle se hi kisi ke saath sambandh main ho
 The study has been published in the journal 'social and Personal Relationships'

 How can anyone erase their lust from dead bodies? balaatkaar kii ek vaardaat ko lekar jab puraa desh apane qadamon par ho
 When there is a national debate on lynching of rapists to burn them alive
 tab aise main us balaatkaari kii soch kaa sach jaananaa jaruri ho jaataa he, jo balaatkaar karata he
 It becomes important to know how a person suddenly becomes a wolf? What is the intoxication of which he crosses all the limits of drunkenness? Why a person suddenly becomes so hungry that even to cool the fire of lust, the corpses start scratching
 aakhir ek balaatkaari ke man main us vakt chalata kya he
 What does he think wo chahta kya he? to zaahir he is khaufnak soch kaa sach koi balaatkaari hi bataa saktaa he

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator
 In the midst of a political crisis that arose due to poor health of Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar, the Congress, the largest party, was likely to form the government
 lekin congress kaa yah daanvbijepike chanakyamit shaahake aage tab ulataa pad gaya, jab congress ke hi do vidhayakon ne party se istipha dekar bijepi main shaamil hone kaa faisla kar liya
 Following the resignation of the two Congress mlas in the Hagovaya Legislative Assembly, the 40-member Goa Legislative Assembly has come down to 38 and the largest party Congress's 16 mlas has come down to 14
 vidhansabha kii taaja sthiti par najar daalen to congress-bijepi ke paas 14-14 vidhayak, maharashtravaadi gomantak party ke 3, goa forward party ke 3, 3 nirdaleey or ensipi ke 1 vidhayak shaamil hai
 bjp's difficulty after Parrikar? Despite the continued health of Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar, BJP kept him as Chief Minister
 iske peeche kii vajah he ki bijepi ko samarthan dene vaali partiyaan parrikar ke alaava kisi or netaa maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 It is worth noting that in view of the acceptance of Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar, he was handed over the command of Goa by taking charge of the defense minister of the country
 aapako bataa den ki kuch maheene pehle bijepi kii taraf se koshish kii gai thi ki vidhayak dal kii baithak bulaakar kisi or ko netaa chun liya jaae lekin bijepi ne apane kadam peeche khinch liye
 Chief Minister Parrikar has returned to his village from AIIMS in Delhi and the situation regarding his health is not publicly clear
 goa main vipakshi congress lagaataar rajyapal mridula sinha se rajya ke sanvaidhanik sankat ko dekhte hue vishesh satr bulkar bahumat sabit karne kii maang kar rahi thi
 In this context, the Congress on Monday wrote a memorandum to the President informing him of the latest situation
 ye he bijepi kii ranneeticongress ke lagaataar badhate dabaav or manohar parrikar ke swasthya ko lekar uhapoh kii sthiti main bijepi ek baar phir sakriy hui he
 It is clear that the party does not want to let go of the power of Goa
 or aise samay to bilkul bhi nahin jab paanch rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 So in such a situation the BJP seems to be working on this strategy that if anyone other than Parrikar is elected as the leader then the party will have to prove majority in the assembly
 aisen main agar bijepi ko samarthan de rahi partiyon ne parrikar ke alaava kisi or ko netaa maanane se inkaar kar diya to isaki bharpai kaise hogi? congress ke do vidhayak dayanand sopate or subhash shirodakar ke istife se vidhansabha kii sankhya ghatakar 38 ho gai he
 So now 19 mlas will be required to prove majority
 aise nikalegaa bahumat kaa rastacongress chhod bijepi main shaamil hone vaale in vidhayakon kaa daawa he ki bhavishya main congress ke or vidhayak party chhod sakate hai
 If the claim of these mlas is proved true then BJP will not have difficulty in proving majority to form the government headed by another leader
 lihaaja ek baar phir bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii chanakya niti ke saamne congress haath malati rah jaaegi
 Significantly, in the Goa Assembly elections held in February 2017, the Congress emerged as the single largest party with 16 mlas
 lekin 14 vidhayakon vaali bijepi ne 9 anya vidhayakon ke samarthan ke saath sarkaar bana lee or congress dekhati rah gai
