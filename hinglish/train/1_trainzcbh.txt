 If Nitish Kumar did not give the status of Patna University up to Central University, as Nitish Kumar said, then where can Nitish Kumar have the courage to ask Narendra Modi for special state status for Bihar? My Prime Minister Modi and Nitish Kumar have some questions
 
 
 pehla sawaal to yah ki kya nitish kumaar BJP ko abhi bhi 'bharat jalaao party' or 'badkaa juthi party' maanate he? agar maanate he to saath kyon he? agar nahin maanate to apane pehle vaale vaktavy ke liye maafi maange? kya narendra modi JDU ko abhi bhi 'janata kaa daman or utpeedan' maanate he? agar maanate he to janata ke daman or utpeedan main saath kyon he?, teesraa sawaal yah ki kya narendra modi bihar kii janata se vishesh rajya kaa darja nahin dene ke apane vaade se mukarne kii maafi maangenge? modi ji ne loksabhaa chunaav main anekon baar bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kaa vaada or ghoshnaa kii thi? sawaal to yah bhi he ki kya modi ji 1 lakh 65 hazaar karod kaa drametic vishesh package kaa vistrut lekha-jokha bihar kii janata ko denge? sawaal to yah he ki kya rambilas paswan ko bagal main baitaakar nitish kumaar parivaarwaad par bhaashan denge? nitish kumaar ko chunauti detaa hoon ki agar wo parivaarwaad ke kilaaf he, to saarvajanik rup se ghoshnaa kare kii wo apane suputr ko raajnneeti main nahin laayenge or parivaravaadi dalon se gathbandhan nahin karenge
 Tejashwi Yadav asked that Amrapali CMD Anil Sharma who contested from Nitish Kumar's party
 jo bijepi kii madad se rajyasabha chunaav lade
 Will Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar end corruption by taking corrupt people like Mukul Roy, Yedurappa, Sukhram and Anil Sharma? Will Narendra Modi be counted with his word to report to the public the action taken against Nitish Kumar's 33 scams and 10 more big scams like creation after that? If Modi is honest against corruption, then why not speed up the CBI investigation against Nitish Kumar for creation and other scams? Modi only, this dualism will not work in Bihar? Will Nitish Kumar take this pledge by writing publicly from the stage at the Sankalp rally tomorrow and give an affidavit that he will not compromise with any other coalition except the BJP and retaliate till the 2024 general election
 agar wo aisa nahin karte he to spasht he ki wo aam chunaav ke baad kursi dekh kisi bhi dal ke saath bhaag sakate he
 Will the BJP take an affidavit from him? Tejashwi asked if PM Modi will make public the DNA report of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar in Patna tomorrow
 Nitish ji sent a PMO after cutting a hair and nails of 1 crore Biharis, including himself, by filling a train
 ‬ kya modi ji bataayenge nitish ji ne unki thali kyon khinchi thi? baadh ke samay unki madad ko kyon nakaara tha? 2103 me unke naam par bijepi se gathbandhan kyon todaa tha? kya nitish kumaar or narendra modi bataayenge bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja kyon nahin diya ja rahaa? aise main sawaal yah bhi uthta he ki kya narendra modi har naagarik ko 15 lakh rupye er yuvaaon ko salanaa 2 karod naukari dene ke apane vaade par spashtikaran dena chahenge? kya nitish kumaar satta sangrakshit or samposhit mujaffarpur jan balaatkaar mahapaap ke liye janata se maafi maangenge? The issue of Pakistan was overshadowed by the Sheila Dixit government in Delhi and the Bharatiya Janata Party rally held at Ramlila Maidan against the rising electricity rates
 party ke rashtriya adhyaksh rajnath singh ne is raily main pakistan par koi karrwai na karne ko lekar centre sarkaar par jamkar hamalaa bolaa or kaha ki seemaa par paak sena kii karrwai ke baad bharat ko pakistan se kisi bhi tarah kii baatcheet turant roak deni chahie
 Rajnath said, the time has come for Pakistan to break its mouth
 virodh darj karaane ke liye bharat ke hai kamishnar ko waapas desh bula lenaa chahie
 The diplomatic relations with Pakistan should be scaled down
 
 
 maine kaha tha par piem ke kaanon par jun tak nahin rengi
 Had it taken timely steps, it would not have dared to attack our posts in Pakistan
 tippaniyan Today's rally is actually seen as the beginning of bjp's campaign for the assembly elections in Delhi in November
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki is raily ke jariye vah 10 aise upaae bataaegi, jisase dilli main bijli ke daam 30 pratishat tak ghat sakate hai
 However, when Rajnath came to speak, the issue of electricity appeared to be left behind by Pakistan
 bijepi ne dilli kii mukhyamantri shila dikshit ko chunauti dete hue kaha ki vah in upayon ko lagu kare, taaki dillivaasiyon ko sasti bijli muhaiyaa karai ja sake
 At the same time, BJP has also said that if Sheila Dixit does not do this, then it clearly means that the Chief Minister is also involved with private companies

 The High Commissioner of India should call back the country to lodge a protest
 pakistan ke saath jo kootnithik rishte hai, use scale down kar dena chahie
 
 
 i said but the pm's ears will not even louse
 samay rahete agar kadam uthaae hote to pakistan kii hamaari chaukiyon par hamalaa karne kii himmat nahin hoti
 The comments aaj kii raily ko darasal dilli main november main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ke liye bijepi ke prachaar abhiyaan ke aagaaj ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 BJP says that through this rally, it will tell 10 such measures, due to which electricity prices in Delhi can be reduced by 30 percent
 haalanki jab rajnath bolne aae, to pakistan ke aage bijli kaa mudda peeche chhutata dikhaai diya
 The BJP challenged Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit and asked them to implement these measures so that cheap electricity can be provided to Delhiites
 saath hi bijepi ne yah bhi kaha he ki agar shila dikshit aisa nahin karatin hai, to iskaa saaf matlab yah he ki mukhyamantri bhi privet companiyon ke saath mili hui hai

 Shocking the Enforcement Directorate (ED), a local court on Friday granted bail to controversial businessman Hassan Ali Khan in the money laundering and tax evasion case
 adalatane nideshaalay kii hasan ali ko remand par lekar poochtacha karne kii arji khaarij kar di he
 Judge ML Tahaliyani of the Principal Sessions Court rejected the agency's plea that the Enforcement Directorate had not produced any evidence on the basis of which Hassan Ali would be given on remand
 haalanki adaalat ne 53 varshiya hasan ali ko jamaanat dene ke liye kuch sharten rakhi hai
 The court has said that horse trader Hasan Ali will not be able to leave Mumbai for five days
 hasan ali ko roj pravartan nideshaalay ke adhikariyon ke samaksh upasthit hone kaa bhi nirdesh diya gaya he
 The Enforcement Directorate has said that it will challenge the decision in a larger court
 hasan ali par switzraland ke ubies bank main aath arab dollars kaa dhan jamaa karaane or videshon main anya gaiyrkanoonee lenden karne kaa aarope he
 He was detained by the Enforcement Directorate on Monday under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act
 us par kar chori kaa bhi aarope he
 After the ed's application was dismissed and Hassan Ali was released on bail, the investigating agency's lawyer Rajiv Awasthi said that he would go to a larger court against the verdict
 avasthi ne kaha ki is faisle ke adhyayan ke baad badi adaalat main apil kii jaaegi
 Awasthi told reporters, 'we have strong evidence to this point, but perhaps the court did not pay attention to those facts
 ham ab badi adaalat main jaaenge
 He said that the Enforcement Directorate's investigation in this case was proceeding effectively
 ‘hamen kuch sampark mili hai
 To add them, it is necessary to take Hasan Ali on remand
 ’adaalat ne gat buudhvaar ko bhi pravartan nideshaalay dwaara hasan ali ke maamle main thik se peshbandi nahin karne ke liye jaane agency ko aade haathon liya tha
 The court had said that the investigating agency has not even been able to present a case to take the businessman into custody
 adaalat ne agency ko apana ‘homework’ karne ko kaha tha
 Tahaliyani had pulled up the Enforcement Directorate, saying, "you people could not even make a case against Khan
" aap kis liye uskaa remand chaahate hai
 What do you want to ask him? aapako kam se kam uskaa ek aparaadh to bataanaa hoga
 In its appeal to take Hasan Ali on remand, the Enforcement Directorate had mentioned that he had allegedly deposited large amount of money abroad
 saath hi uske hathiyaaron ke antarrashtriya saudagar adnan khashogi ke saath bhi sambandh hai
 The application also mentions that Hasan Ali had several passports based on fake documents
 hasan ali ko is maamle main shretreey passport karyaalay kii shikaayat ke baad 2008 main giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 He was subsequently released on bail
 idi kii arji main kaha gaya tha ki hasan ali ne videshi bainkon ke apane khaaton se bharat ke baahar ke kai khaaton main dhan sthanantaran kaa nirdesh diya tha
 It states that he has transferred an amount of 7,00,000 from Citrus Bank of Switzerland to the account of uk's Financial Services through Citibank
 idi ne khan par 36,000 karod rupee kii videshi mudra rakhane kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he
 On Hassan Ali's relationship with Khashogi, the Directorate has said that it needs to be thoroughly investigated, as it is also a threat to national security
 hasan ali ke khashogi or aatankwaad se jude logon se sambandhon ke maddenjar ucchtam nyaayalay ne mangalvaar ko jaanch agenciyon se kaha tha ki ve uske khilaaf aatankwaad rodhak kanoon kaa maamla chalaane kaa bhi vikalp talash karen
 Accusing Hassan Ali of not cooperating in the investigation, the Enforcement Directorate has said that he could tamper with the evidence and dispose of the money deposited in foreign bank accounts
 easter se thik pehle china main ek aisi ajeebogareeb dish kii taiyaari chal rahi he ki sunakar hi aapako ghin aane lagegi
 This dish is, 'boiled eggs in boys' urine
 ' bataaya jaataa he ki china ke jhejiyang praant ke dongyang main hajaaron saalon se yah dish banaai or khai ja rahi he
 According to the news published in the British website 'daily Mail', this year also the chefs of Dongyang are inviting the whole world to try their dish
 shef kaa daawa he ki is baar ye andey behad acchhee quality ke honge or unamem ek 'khatta' swaad hoga
 Surprisingly, these eggs have a special 'cultural significance' in China
 hajaaron saalon se vasant ke mausam main bacchon ke peshaab main uble hue andey khaane kii parampara rahi he
 Chef Lu Ming explains that urine is collected from local schools
 ladke baltiyon main peshaab karte hai or vahaan se har din taaja peshaab le liya jaataa he
 The eggs are healthy, the chefs claim, suggesting that the eggs are boiled twice in the urine
 pehle chhilka hataae bina or phir baad main chhilka hataakar
 Only then are they served to eat
 ming kehete hai, 'ye andey laajawab or healdi hote hai
 Eating them does not cause fever
 or agar aap sust mahasoos kar rahe hon to inhen khaakar taazgi aati he
 He says, "we are also focusing on exporting it because we want people outside China to appreciate our dish
" '2008 main sthaneey shahar ne in andon ko 'saanskrithik viraasat' ghoshit kar diya tha
 Even talk of applying for UNESCO World Heritage status was in the news
 haalanki shef yah nahin bataa paae ki is saal andey kuch atirikt khattey kyon hai
 The chefs claim that these eggs are good for health, but not everyone in Dongyang believes this theory
 haalanki news agency royatres ke mutabik, chini medical export in andon ke sambandh main logon ko cheta chuke hai
 "we have a belief that boiled eggs in urine are good for health and do not cause cold," says a resident here
 par main ise nahin maanata or na hi unhen khaataa hum

 Giriraj on Tuesday indirectly attacked the Bihar Chief Minister after Nitish Kumar's discussion of a secular candidate for the post of Prime Minister was waged
 apane aakraamak tevar ko giriraaj singh ne aaj bhi jari rakhaa
 The BJP quota minister said, "I will continue to support Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi

 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘nitish kumaar yadi modi ke samarthan ko lekar meri baat se asahmat hai to vah mujhe mantri pad se barkhaast kar den
 The Minister of Animal and Fishery Resources said that the issue of raising the issue of the prime ministerial candidate for the NDA is not understood at the time of the presidential election
 giriraaj ne kaha, ‘‘loksabhaa chunaav ko lekar pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar kaa mudda is samay chhedana bin badal barsaat kii tarah he
 "he said," Every BJP leader and activist including Narendra Modi is secular

" ’’ kumaar ne kaha ki aisa hota he to jadyu ko apana samarthan waapas lene se bhi gurej nahin hoga

 Giriraj Singh continued his aggressive attitude
 bhaajapa ke cote ke is mantri ne kaha, ‘‘main gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kaa samarthan karnaa jari rakhuunga
 He is a secular leader and has the full support of the people of Gujarat
 mere samarthan ko lekar yadi mukhyamantri nitish kumaar asahaj mahasoos kar rahe hai to mujhe mantri pad se hataa den
 "he said," If Nitish Kumar disagrees with me about Modi's support, he should dismiss me from the post of minister

 Giriraj said, "the issue of the Prime Ministerial candidate for the Lok Sabha elections at this time is like raining without a cloud
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘narendra modi sahit bhaajapa kaa prayek netaa or kaaryakarta dharmanirpeksh hai

 It is wrong to accuse them as communal
 jansangh or bhaajapa par bhi is prakaar ke aarope lage lekin partiyon kii sarkaar bani

 apni naaraazgi kaa izhaar karte hue vah nitish kumaar kii adhyakshata main mangalvaar ko hui cabinet kii baithak main bhi shaamil nahin hue the
 The comments baharhaal jadyu ke pravaktaa or vidhaan parshad niraj kumaar ne kaha, ‘‘bhaajapa yadi narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karti he to jadyu rajg gathbandhan ko ‘tata’ or ‘gudby’ kah degaa
 Kumar said that if this happens, the JDU will not be averse to withdrawing its support
 jadyu ke ek anya netaa or panchayat raaj mantri bhim singh ne kaha, ‘‘bhaajapa ek sampradayik party ke naam par achhut bani hui thi
 jdu's alliance in 1996 increased its (BJP) acceptance
 jab tak jadyu kaa saath nahin tha keval shivasena hi bhaajapa kii sahyogi thi

 film kaa naam: phantmadiarector: kabir khanster cast: saf ali khan, katrina caff, mohammad jishaan ayumvadhi: 147 minutesrtificate: u / aretimga: 2
 5 Starkbir Khan has recently made blockbuster films like 'bajrangi Bhaijaan', and producer director Sajid Nadiadwala directed the best film like 'kick'
 ab in donon ne milakar 'phantum' banaai he jisamen diarection kaa kaam kabir khan kaa he or sajid nadiadwala produsar kii bhoomika main hai
 The film based on the 26 / 11 terrorist attack in Mumbai, S
 hossain jaidi kii likhi ek kitaab se prerit he
 Will this film live up to expectations? Let us review - Kahaani: The story of the film is of a mission created after the 26 / 11 major attack, under which the people associated with this attack have to be caught and punished severely
 is mishan main danial khan (saf ali khan) or navaj mistre (katrina)ahm bhoomika nibhaane ke lienical padate hai
 The most important reason for Daniel to join this mission is that he has to prove to his father that he is a very capable son
 ab kya 26 / 11 ke doshiyon ko pakadaa ja sakegaa? kya unhen kadi sajaa ho paaegi? kabir khan ne yahi darshane kii purajor koshish kii he
 The script and screenplay of the script, acting and music film is commendable but after the interval the story of the film starts taking a strange twist and especially when the climax of the film comes, there is a typical Hindi film ending
 jis tarah se kabir ne alag-alag deshon main shooting karke film main vijual treet di he, uske baad kaash clymex thodaa or behatar hota
 Some parts of the story and the action are tremendous but there is something that was missing
 kai jagahon par imotional karne kii koshish bhi kii gai lekin jabaran bhavuk hona bhi laazmi nahin tha
 There are also some moments in the film when the applause is heard, especially when Saif Ali Khan tells the terrorist what India ultimately wants
 film dekhte hue is baat kaa ilm bhi hota he ki isamen research kaa kaam bahut zyada tha or paisa kaaphi laga hoga
 If we talk about acting, Saif Ali Khan has done a great acting after a long time and Kabir Khan has made a good acting out of Katrina Kaif
 film main mohammad jishaan ayub kaa kirdaar bhi kaaphi saraahneey he jo aapako har ek frem main baandhe rakhata he
 The casting director of the film will also have to praise that he has made the right choice from driver to key characters
 film kaa sangeet bhi maukey kii najaakat ke hisaab se karact tha khaas taur se becoground geet, jo aksar tukdon-tukdon membhavuk maahaulmein aata he
 Why see - Kabir has given a tag line to the film 'I wish this story was true' and really seeing this story, you would like to say the same
 agar aap saf ali khan, katrina caff yaa kabir khan ke fain hai to film jarur dekhen
 Why not watch - If you are patriotic and avoid thriller films, then you do not watch this film at all

 a sister raised the ground to treat her brother
 uske bhai santosh kii kidney kharaab thi
 Doctors recommend a kidney transplant
 choti bahan kii kidney match kar gai
 Meanwhile, the money was coming in, which the Prime Minister's Relief Fund has made up for
 baavjood iske bahan apane bhai ko nahin bachaa saki
 Because in PGI Lucknow this number of patients is more than their capacity
 jisaki vajah se use lambi date mil rahi thi
 Santosh and his sister were waiting for this date, but waiting for the death was not acceptable
 wo badi besabr nikali or unki zindagi se unke bhai santosh ko hameshaa ke liye chin kar le gai
 This shock of the brother's departure has occurred on the sister Rekha, that she faints in her sorrow at times, then sometimes gets up and insists on cooking for her
 phir achaanak use lori bhi sunaane lagati he
 The whole house is now handling it
 unhen lagata he ki unke bhai ko beemaari se kahin zyada system ne maaraa he isliye wo chaahati he ki ye system thik ho
 Santosh's sister Rita says that today the disappointment is that the lamp of my house is gone, it used to carry the weight of five sisters, two brothers
 is ghar kaa aarthik sahaara tha or usamen jeene kii bahut ichha thi or is system ne use maar daalaa
 This system should be changed because no one else cries like we are crying today
 is khabar ke baad media kaa jamaavada jab uske ghar pahunchataa he to rekha kuch yun daantate hue sabhi ko bhagaati he
 She says go away you guys, you guys did nothing for my brother
 santosh kii bahan reeta kahati he ki main lagaataar aath maheene se daud rahi hum
 Lucknow to Benaras, Banaras to Lucknow, PMO Office to Banaras from there to PGI and from there to Medical College Lucknow
 medical kalege lakhanu to do maheene se daud rahi thi par esagipijiai or piemo aphis to aath maheene se daud rahi thi
 There was only assurance that Rita ji should go here, go there, meet the leader but nothing happened
 in aath maheenon main santosh kii bahanon ne apane bhai ke ilaaj ke liye har koshish kii
 The shadow of the parents has already risen
 lihaaja santosh aas-pados ke bacchon ko padhaakar ghar kaa guzaara chalaata tha
 At the same time, when the brother fell ill, the sisters mortgaged the house for treatment money
 jab transplant kii baat ai to piemo aphis main guhaar lagaayee, vahaan sunwaayee bhi hui or 2 lakh 17 hazaar kii madad bhi mili
 Which got deposited in SGPGI
 lekin vahaan use transplant ke liye taarikh nahin mili
 SGPGI said that the date will not be available so soon and if the date is to be taken, the number can be obtained after one and a half years and if there is a problem then do daily dialysis
 par bada sawaal ye he ki jiske paas dhan nahin wo har roj kaise dialysis kara saktaa he kyonki ek dialysis main chaar se paanch hazaar rupee kharch hote hai
 The comments lihaaja ghar bhi girvee rakh kar sabhi bhai bahan himmat kar rahe the
 But when the date was not found and the kidneys could not wait, Santosh went away from his siblings forever
 aaj uske bhai bahan ye kah rahe hai ki pradhanmantri ne use paisa to dilaa diya par date nahin dilaa paae
 Although Santosh and his sisters were waiting for the doctors' date, but death was very desperate, he did not wait

 After this news, when the gathering of the media reaches his house, Rekha drives everyone away with some scolding

 vahaan par sirf aashwashan hi mil rahaa tha ki reeta ji yahaan chali jaaie, vahaan chali jaaie, us netaa se mil lijie lekin kuch nahin hua
 In these eight months, Santosh's sisters made every effort to treat their brother

 So Santosh used to teach the children of the neighborhood and run the house
 vahiin, bhai jab biimaar pad gaya to bahanon ne ilaaj ke paise ke liye makaan girvee rakh diya
 When it came to the transplant, the PMO approached the office, there was a hearing and 2 lakh 17 thousand also got help

 esagipijiai ne kaha ki date itani jaldi nahin mil paaegi or date leni he to saal dedh saal baad number mil saktaa he or agar problem hoti he to daily dialysis karaao
 But the big question is that one who does not have money can do dialysis everyday because a dialysis costs four to five thousand rupees

 Santosh's death raises many questions
 kya is desh main garibon ke ilaaj kaa sud lene vaala koi nahin, kya aazaadee ke itane saal baad bhi ham is tarah ki vyavastha nahin kar paae hai ki kidney transplant jaise gambhir ilaaj ke liye har jile main ek mukammal vyavastha ho sake, kya ham is desh main is tarah ki bimariyon ke liye lambii line ko khatm kar sakenge
 The leaders of the country must answer this
 santosh kii bahan reeta kahati he ki main lagaataar aath maheene se daud rahi hum
 Lucknow to Benaras, Banaras to Lucknow, PMO Office to Banaras from there to PGI and from there to Medical College Lucknow
 medical kalege lakhanu to do maheene se daud rahi thi par esagipijiai or piemo aphis to aath maheene se daud rahi thi
 There was only assurance that Rita ji should go here, go there, meet the leader but nothing happened
 in aath maheenon main santosh kii bahanon ne apane bhai ke ilaaj ke liye har koshish kii
 The shadow of the parents has already risen
 lihaaja santosh aas-pados ke bacchon ko padhaakar ghar kaa guzaara chalaata tha
 At the same time, when the brother fell ill, the sisters mortgaged the house for treatment money
 jab transplant kii baat ai to piemo aphis main guhaar lagaayee, vahaan sunwaayee bhi hui or 2 lakh 17 hazaar kii madad bhi mili
 Which got deposited in SGPGI
 lekin vahaan use transplant ke liye taarikh nahin mili
 SGPGI said that the date will not be available so soon and if the date is to be taken, the number can be obtained after one and a half years and if there is a problem then do daily dialysis
 par bada sawaal ye he ki jiske paas dhan nahin wo har roj kaise dialysis kara saktaa he kyonki ek dialysis main chaar se paanch hazaar rupee kharch hote hai
 The comments lihaaja ghar bhi girvee rakh kar sabhi bhai bahan himmat kar rahe the
 But when the date was not found and the kidneys could not wait, Santosh went away from his siblings forever
 aaj uske bhai bahan ye kah rahe hai ki pradhanmantri ne use paisa to dilaa diya par date nahin dilaa paae
 Although Santosh and his sisters were waiting for the doctors' date, but death was very desperate, he did not wait
 santosh kii maut kai sawaal khadey kar rahe he
 Is there no one who can cure the treatment of the poor in this country, have we not been able to make such a system even after so many years of independence that there can be a complete system in every district for serious treatment like kidney transplant, can we We will be able to eliminate long lines for such diseases in the country
 iskaa jawaab desh ke netaaon ko zarur dena padegaa
 In these eight months, Santosh's sisters made every effort to treat their brother
 maa baap kaa saaya pehle hi uth chukaa he
 So Santosh used to teach the children of the neighborhood and run the house
 vahiin, bhai jab biimaar pad gaya to bahanon ne ilaaj ke paise ke liye makaan girvee rakh diya

 haalanki RJD main jis tarah kaa ghatnakram ghat rahaa he wo party pramukh lalu kii chintaaen kam karne kii jagah badhaane vaala hi he
 The party performed poorly in the Lok Sabha elections
 vahiin lalu ke donon beton main kathith duuri ke kisse bhi aae din surkhiyaan banate rahete hai
 Reports of a rift in the marital relationship of his elder son Tej Pratap are also common
 jharkhand main RJD do dhadon main bant chuki he

 bihar ke purv mukhyamantri dow mishra lambey samay se biimaar the
 Dr
 Mishra was out on bail in several cases related to the fodder scam

 ’vahiin RJD ne party kii sthiti ko lekar khaas chintit hone se inkaar kiya
 rjd's Jharkhand unit president Abhay Singh expressed concern over the health of party president Lalu and wished him a speedy recovery
 abhaya singh ne kaha, ‘party ne apane janm se hi bahut utaar-chadhaav dekhe hai
 It is true that the RJD is facing difficult flowing waters but at the same time it is also certain that the party will return to its heyday

 ' rigerv bankne ek baar logon ko chaunkaa diya
 After the inflation data came in, it gave a big signal by cutting the Subharpo rate of Thursday by 25 basis points
 iske baad ab repo rate 7
 75 percent
 iskaa sidhaa matlab yah hua ki byaaj daron main katautee kii shuruyaat ho gai he
 Governor Rajan says that this step has been taken only because of the continuous decrease in the rate of inflation
 darasal pichley saal se hamane mahangaai ko ghatate dekha or usase bhi badhkar kachche tel kii antarrashtriya keemton ko girte dekha
 All these were pushing for lowering of interest rates
 ab yah tay he ki kachche tel kii keemten kam se kam is saal neeche hi rahengi
 With the monsoon being almost normal, prices of cereals can also be expected to remain stable
 rigerv bank kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki rajasav ghate ke morche par bhi sarkaar ko safalataa mili he or vah niyantran main hi rahegaa
 Rajan also says that if the rate of inflation remains the same, then the repo rate will decrease in the beginning of next year
 ye to thim desh ke kendriya bank kii baaten
 But the question arises that were not so much interest rates indirectly responsible for inflation? Due to interest rates, the budget of middle class people who took home loans, car loans, their budgets deteriorated
 karjadaar bainkon ke lone chukaa paane main asamarth ho gaye
 The NPA of banks rose to the maximum
 halaat aise ho gaye ki mandi kii maar jhel rahe kaarobaariyon ke liye karj pichley janm ke paap kii tarah ho gaya tha
 Interest rates in none of the developing countries of the world were as high as in India
 isane desh kii arthvyavastha ke pahiyon main brake lagane kaa kaam kiya
 Nevertheless, the Reserve Bank kept its tune alive
 use lagata tha ki isse mudrasphiti par roak lagi hui he jabaki aankade bataate hai ki subba raav ke kaary kaal main 13 baar byaaj daron main badhotaree ke baavjood mahangaai nahin rukii
 Actually, when there is inflation of everyday items or food and drink, then the formula of raising interest rates does not work
 vaise bhi bharat jaise desh main jahaan lakhon karod rupee kaa kaala dhan jamaa he, byaaj daren bahut zyada myne nahin rakhti
 a rigid monetary policy continues to hurt the economy
 ab rigerv bank ne ek bada kadam uthaaya he
 If this continues further, industries and home loan takers will get relief and GDP growth will accelerate

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) On November 22, 2019, five people gang-raped a minor girl in Bareilly
 video banaakar kiya viral
 On 3 November 2019, six people gangraped with woman in Chitrakoot, Uttar Pradesh
 police ne mahila kii complen tab likhi jab gangrape kaa video hua tha viral
 On 23 September 2019, a video from Nalanda in Bihar goes viral when the administration learns that a 13-year-old girl has been gang-raped
 ladki video main lagaataar bol rahi hoti he ki bahan samaj kar chhod do magar baari-baari se vahaan maujuud sabhi ladke uskaa balaatkaar karte hai
 This means rape is now being done not just for momentary pleasure but also for earning money
 gangrape ke video kii maang din-ba-din badhati ja rahi he
 Not mentioning his name, a mobile shopkeeper from Bihar said that porn is scripted and repeated
 iksaitment ke liye customer gangrape ke video downlod karte hai
 "this is just a hallmark
 na jane aisi kitni hi vaaradaaten jo vaqt ke pannon par darj nahin ho pai hongi
 There will be so many victims whose complaint would not have been lodged by the police
 vah aaj bhi ghut rahi hongi
 Whenever she would hear about the viral video of gang rape and rape with another girl, her spirit would tremble
 unhen vah sab ek baar phir se yaad aata hoga jo un par guzar chukaa he
 a few years ago, when there were no mobile phones with these cameras, the incidents of video sharing taking place in such a rash of rape incidents were common
 aisa nahin he ki tab balaatkaar nahin hote the
 There were still, but the criminal had neither a phone nor cheap internet, on which he would first watch porn comfortably and then rape and make videos to calm his frustration
 jaise-jaise technology hamaare zindagi main shaamil hone lagi or companiyon ne internet kii pahunch sab tak muhaiyaa karvaa di, saamaajik araajaktaa kaa namoona saamne aane laga he
 Now there is both phone and internet, but intellectually humans are not so restrained that they can use that technology to improve their lives properly
 aaj kii tarikh main balaatkaar or gangrape kii badhati hui ghatnaon ke peeche agar sabase bada koi ek factor he to internet par aasaani se uplabdh porn
 People randomly share clips on whatsapp and other social sites for fun
 ek varg jise samaj he ki ise delit kar den wo to isse prabhavit nahin hota lekin vahiin bheed kaa ek bada hissaa aisa he jo in porn clips ko dekhakar hosho-havaas kho baithta he
 And shares it in several groups
 phir dimaag main khud ko vah sab kuch karata hua sochataa he jo video main ho rahaa
 Then these boys start planning
 maheenon tak apane shikaar par nazar bana kar rakhte hai or jaise hi kisi din ladki akeli dikhti he ye tut padate hai
 But rape is no longer their only aim
 apane saathiyon main khud ko mard sabit karnaa
 To show how much bravery i have done is to nurture toxic mentality and to provoke another boy to do wrong
 saath hi saath ab gang-rape ke ye videos bikne bhi lage hai
 a 30-second gang-rape video costs 100 to two hundred rupees
 uttar pradesh or bihar main yah dhandha tezi se bad rahaa he
 Sometimes the purpose of rape is to earn money
 jo balaatkaar kar rahe hote unke dimaag main peedita ko blackmel karke unase paise vasuuli karnaa or us clip ko bechakar paise kamaane kii yojana bhi chal rahi hoti he
 They do not think at all what will be the life of that girl after it goes viral
 or aisa bilkul bhi nahin he ki prashasan ko isaki khabar nahin ho
 This would have been easily happening under the noses of local police and politicians
 kal bhi ek porn site par hyderabad main gang-rape ki shikaar hui doctor priyanka reddy kaa naam trend kar rahaa tha
 Now you can guess from this how the society is falling
 ham lakh candal march nikaal len, soshal media par hashtag trending karvaa len lekin usase kuch nahin hone vaala
 Nothing will change unless the people standing in the last row of the society are educated and sensitized
 jab bhi nirbhaya or priyanka reddy jaisi ghatnaayen ghatati hai, ham thodaa virodh karke chup ho jate hai
 We start looking for girls without going into the depths of the problem
 sex ko lekar jab tak ham aise kunthit rahenge, us par charchaa or bacchon khaskar ladakon se baat nahin karenge koi badlaav nahin aane vaala
 And this change is not going to happen in one night
 ham sabko apane-apane str par kaam karne kii zarurat he

 kapoor) on Dec 6, 2016 at 1:24am PST The Expert Committee of the Central Government, which formulated a new policy for Haj, termed the objection of some Muslim organizations as unnecessary for the removal of the condition of 'mehram' for women above 45 years of age and said that the Hajj expenses from the new policy Will decrease significantly
 bharat se kareeb har saal 170,000 log haj par ja sakate hai
 According to the recent Peshnai Haj policy, women above 45 years of age can go on Haj without Mehram
 meharam us shaks ko kehete hai, jisase mahila kaa nikaah nahin ho saktaa
 For example, father, real brother, son and grandson and Navasa may be Mehram
 ol india muslim majalis-e-mushaavrat tathaa kuch anya muslim samoohon ne bina meharam ke haj par jane kii chhot ko lekar aapatti jataate hue kaha he ki sarkari samiti ne 'vyaavhaarik dikkaton' ko nazarandaaj kiya he
 Afzal Amanullah, who is believed to be the new Hajj policymaker and convenor of this expert committee, said, 'during the whole process of formulating the new Haj policy, we approached the Saudi Arabian government, then it came to know that there was someone from their side to do the Haj alone for women There is no restriction
 bharat sarkaar or saudi arab ke bich samjhaute ke tahat meharam saath jane kii vyavastha thi
 We allowed women of 45 years and above to go on Haj without Mehram
 ' unhone kaha, 'muslim samaaj main alag-alag panthon ke log meharam maamle par apane tareeke se aage bad sakate hai
 If it is forbidden in any sect, then in that case Mehram can be sent
 is niti ko kisi par thopa nahin jayega
 Mohammad Irfan Ahmed, a member of the Haj Committee of India, said, "this is a revolutionary step
" is par kuch log bevajaah vivaad khadaa kar rahe hai
 This should be seen as an important step towards the empowerment of women
 'kai muslim sanghathanon ke pratinidhi samooh ol india muslim majalish e-mushaavrat ke adhyaksh naved hamid kaa kahana he, 'ham is maamle main dharmik nazariye se baat nahin kar rahe hai
 Practical difficulties have been ignored in formulating the new Haj policy
 haj kaa safar mushkil bharaa hota he
 Have to walk a lot
 thakne or biimaar padane kaa andeshaa bahut adhik hota he
 Seeing these problems makes it easier to be with someone
 nai haj niti main in pahaluon par khyal nahin kiya gaya he
 On the other hand, Afzal Amanullah says that after the new Haj policy is implemented, the expenditure on Haj will be reduced considerably from next year
 unhone kaha, 'nai haj niti lagu hone ke baad saudi arab main rahane, parivahan or duusare kharchon main kaaphi kami aegi
 Those going on Haj through the Haj Committee are going to get a lot of relief

 darasal, ek yuva mahila intern ne haal hi main sevanivrutt sheersh adaalat ke ek nyaayadhish par aarope lagaaya he ki unhone pichley saal disambar main ek hotel ke kamare main uske saath us samay durvyahaar kiya jab rajdhani samuhik balaatkaar kii ghatana se jujh rahi thi
 This woman has graduated from the National University of Juridical Science, Kolkata this year
 usne kathith yon utpeedan kii ghatana ke bare main apane blog main likhaa he
 In a blog written for the Journal of Indian Law and Society on 6 November, the woman advocate said that the incident occurred during her internship with the judge of the apex court
 blog ke anusaar, pichhlaa disambar desh main mahilaon ke hiton kii raksha ke andolan ke liye mahatvapurn tha, kyonki desh kii lagbhag samoochee aabaadi mahilaon ke prati hinsa ke khilaaf swat: hi khadi ho gai thi
 It is a strange irony that i have such experience in the backdrop of the protest in the world
 blog main likhaa gaya he ki dilli main us samay uniwarsity main mere antim varsh ke sheetakaaleen avkaash ke dauraan main intern thi
 i was working under a highly distinguished, recently retired Supreme Court judge during my last summers
 unki sahaayta ke liye unke paas pahunchane ke liye maine athak shram kiya or police kii baadhaon ko chakma diya
 The blog reads, as a reward for my alleged hard work, i was rewarded by sexual harassment (not bodily harm, but abusers) by an older man, who was my grandfather's age
 main is peedaadaayak vivaran kaa zikr nahin karuungi, lekin itnaa jaruri kahuungi ki kamare se baahar nikalne ke kaaphi baad tak meri smriti main vah anubhav rahaa or vastav main aaj bhi he
 This law graduate has also interviewed a website
 uskaa kahana he ki hotel ke kamare main nyaayadhish ne uskaa utpeedan kiya or is ghatana kaa koi anya gavaah bhi nahin he
 In a conversation with 'legally India', this young lawyer said, it was a hotel room, (people) saw me going voluntarily, and saw me coming out in peace
 main bhay ke saath nahin bhaagi
 At that time i felt that i should walk in peace
 maine us din kisi se bhi iskaa zikr nahin kiya
 The woman did not mention the date of the incident in her blog, but in an interview to the website said that it happened on December 24 last year
 blog ke anusaar, jaisaa pehle kaha gaya he mere dil main us vyakti ke prati koi durbhaavna nahin he or na hi uske jeevanabhar ke kaam or pratishtha ko daanv par lagaana chaahati hum
 On the contrary, i felt that it was my responsibility to not let other young girls fall into this type of situation, but i failed to find a solution
 mahila ne yah bhi kaha ki jabardast saarvajanik bahes, mahilaon ke adhikaron ke prati jaagarukta or nae aapraadhik kanoonon ke baavjood use nahin lagata ki is par ankush laga he
 In the interview she said, i have heard about three other cases (sexual harassment) by this same judge and i know at least four other girls who have faced sexual harassment of other judges, which might not have been as bad as me
 Will happen
 inamen se adhikansh nyaayadhishon ke chambaron main thim or aasapaas duusare log the, isliye shaayad unke saath itnaa bura nahin hua
 According to this woman, i know a girl who has been sexually harassed constantly and due to this she has to face difficulties in her work as well
 ant main is mahila ne sawaal kiya he ki yon hinsa kaa saamana karte samay kya ham gusse se aage jaakar apni bhaawanaaon ko angikaar kar sakate hai or is tarah kii ghatnaon kaa saamana karte samay bhaawanaaon kii jatilta sweekaar karen
 About a year after the incident, she revealed in her blog that although she was deeply hurt and a little angry at the person, she did not hate it
 isaki bajaay vah is baat se hatprabh or aahat thi ki ek vyakti, jisaki vah itani izzat karti thi, usne is tarah kii harakat kii

 aam chunaav 2019 nazadik hai, or haal hi main teen rajyon main sarkaar gathit karne ke turant baad kisaanon ke karz maaf kar congress front foot par aakar pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bhi deshbhar ke kisaanon ke kalyaan ke liye kadam uthaane kii chunauti de rahi he
 The Prime Minister himself has been announcing the goal of doubling the income of farmers for a long time by 2022, claiming to be the concern of farmers, and for this, the Chief Minister's Agriculture Scheme in Jharkhand on the lines of Rathu Bandhu scheme of TRS government of Telangana Has also been announced, but something like this is yet to happen in the whole country
 darasal, telugana main raythu bandhu yojana yaa kisaan nivesh sahaayta yojana (FISS) ko 10 may, 2018 main hi lagu kiya gaya tha, jiske tahat saal main do fasalon ke liye rajya sarkaar dwaara unhen nivesh sahaayta ke rup main 8,000 rupee prati acre ke hisaab se die jate hai
 58 in Telangana
 33 lakh kisaanon ko kharif tathaa rabi satron ke liye 4,000-4,000 rupee prati acre kii madad di ja rahi he, jiske liye sarkaar ne 2018-19 ke rajya bajet main 12,000 karod rupee kaa aavanton kiya gaya tha
 The Rythu Bandhu scheme is the country's first scheme of its kind
 iske baad haal hi main jharkhand main BJP kii raghubar das sarkaar ne mukhyamantri krishi yojana kii ghoshnaa kii he, jise vittvarsh 2019-20 se lagu kiya jayega
 22 under this scheme of Rs
 2,250 crore
 76 lakh madhyam tathaa chote kisaanon ko 5,000 rupee prati acre kii sahaayta di jaaegi
 In Telangana, where all farmers are being given the benefit, in Jharkhand, this help will be provided only to those farmers whose cultivated land will be less than five acres
 ek acre se bhi kam khetihar zamin ke maalikon ko bhi 5,000 rupee kii raashi hi di jaaegi
 This assistance amount will be handed over to the farmers through check or direct benefit transfer
 sutron ke mutabik, ab, jab samay loksabhaa chunaav kaa he, ek yaa do rajyon se kaam nahin chalegaa, or deshbhar ke kisaanon ke liye kuch na kuch karnaa hi hoga
 a nationwide plan on the same pattern is needed to help all the farmers, so hopefully the Narendra Modi government in the upcoming budget session instead of waiving the loans of farmers to respond to the challenge of Congress President Rahul Gandhi Announce any welfare scheme like Telangana or Jharkhand, which will not be possible for the Congress or any other opposition party

 Therefore, the possibility that the cause of death was infection was because the machine was not decontaminated
 darasal in mauton kii vajah bharat main swasthya suvidha muhaiyaa karaane ko lekar sarkaron main ichhashakti kaa abhaav he
 a doctor associated with the health department says, "the scandal like Bilaspur happened because there were not enough resources and the doctor did not expect such a large number of people to arrive
" ”aise main sawaal uthta he ki suvidhaon ke abhaav main vividhtaon se bharaa bharat universal health care yani sabko swasthya kii samuchit suvidha kaa lakshya kaise hasil karegaa? bharat main aaj bhi janm lene vaale 1,000 bacchon main se 43 apana paanchvaan to 37 apana pehla janmdin bhi nahin manaa pate
 The picture of maternal deaths during childbirth is also frightening

 lekin muslim deshon ke aankadon ko saamne rakh bharat sarkaar ek alag pahal shuru karne ja rahi he, jise mishan parivaar vikaas kaa naam diya gaya he
 However, at this rate, Union Minister of State for Health Anupriya Patel tells India Today, "18 per cent of the world's population lives in India and such a large population is a big challenge for us
 isliye jaagrukta ke madhyam se ham 2045 tak badhati aabaadi dar ko sthir karne ke lakshya ko zarur hasil kar lenge
 She says, "there has also been a considerable decline in population growth and as far as fertility rate is concerned, our goal is to make it 2

 This target has 2 out of 24 of the 36 states of the country

 For this, the Ministry of Health is launching an intensive campaign

 Ministry officials say that neither the government nor the society has yet recovered from the misconception about the family planning initiative under Sanjay Gandhi
 isliye sarkaar ise kanoonee taur par lagu karne kii bajaae jaagrukta abhiyaan ke rup main aage badha rahi he
 India does not want to take population control as a target, taking lessons from its neighbor China

 After which China was forced to make its policy flexible
 lekin bharat apni saamaajik-bhugolic vividhtaon ko maddenjar rakhte hue jaagrukta abhiyaan ke jariye badhati aabaadi dar ko 2045 tak sthir bananaa chahta he
 Under this, the central government's strategy is to create such a structure where two children can be replaced in a family instead of two parents

 The Ministry recognizes that the fertility rate in India is worse than in many of the lesser countries of the world due to lack of information, resources and essential resources for family planning

 The family approached the police and by the evening the police exposed the game of kidnapping of Mannat
 mannath ke pita sanjay sharma railway main ejeeniyar hai or bihar ke jamalpur main tainaat hai
 Mannat lives in Mughalsarai with his mother and grandfather
 phiroti maangane ke kaaphi der baad mannath apane naanaa ke ghar chalaa gaya tha or vahaan bhi usne ek managasaint kahani sunai kii vah aparankartaaon ke changul se bhaag niklaa he
 Police recovered Mannat from her maternal grandfather's house
 poochtacha main mannath ne apane apharan kii jo kahani sunai wo hairaan kar dene vaali thi
 Inspector RP Yadav, in-charge of Mughalsarai Kotwali told that the student had seen the 'crime Patrol' serial on Sony TV a day earlier and got the idea of kidnapping by watching the show
 test main fail ho jane ke dar se mannath ne apharan kii kahani ko anjaam de daalaa
 However, after persuading the police, Mannat has handed over Mannat to his family members, but this story indicates how adversely the crime based serials on the TV channel are impacting the children and if If your child is crazy about such a TV serial, then it increases your responsibility that you too keep an eye on him
 mughalsarai kotwali ke inspector aar pi yadav ne kaha, 'mannath sharma naam kaa ladkaa he jo es ji public skool kaa kaksha 7 kaa chaatr he
 Yesterday he saw the Crime Patrol, today it was his test
 test kii taiyaari nahin thi usase bachane ke liye usne khud ke apharan kii sajeesh rachi
 In the morning, after removing the key from his grandfather's pocket and grandmother's jewelry, he took the mobile and some money and laptop and got off the scooter
 scooter ko usne rajghat pul ke paar panchar karke khadaa kar diya
 From there, went to Kashi station and messaged your mother to bring a million rupees or else your boy will be killed
 pareshaan gharavaalon ne police se sampark kiya uske baad ise uske naanaa ke ghar se baraamad kiya gaya
 At first, he lied and then told that the idea came after seeing the Crime Patrol
 'mannath ke mutabik, 'aaj pariksha thi ham yaad nahin kiye the or maar padane ke dar se aisa kiye
 This idea was found by watching Crime Patrol in which a boy talks about his kidnapping himself

 It is said that getting a job is not everything
 naukari ko banaae rakhana or samay-samay par promoshan paanaa bhi ek naukari pesha ke liye jaruri he
 But nowadays, who is unfamiliar with office politics and tension
 acha kaam karo tab bhi lapete main aa jate hai or bura kaam karne waalon kaa hitalist main aana to laazmi he
 Well, after reading this news, you should know that you have not got into these issues, right? offis bole to sir main dariigar kaam par jane kii baat sochate hi aapako dikkat hone lagati he,tension bad jaati he, to mumkin he ki aap dadagiri ke shikaar hon
 Everyone feels bad about going to office on Monday, but this feeling does not last for a week
 2
 If your evil again and again, despite good work and hard work, criticism is not taking the name of stopping, then it is Dadagiri
 bina saboot ke jhaad lagaana bhi yahi he
 Dadagiri also has different faces to target different people
 3
 Screaming at you is often shouting
 agar aap par baar-baar chillaaya ja rahaa he or dusron ke saamne sharminda kiya ja rahaa he, to jaan lijie ki aap nishane par hai
 4
 aapaki galtiyaan yani surkhiyangar aapaki galtiyaan baar-baar uthaai jaati hai or unhen aapke hathiyaar kii tarah istemaal kiya jaataa he, to jaan lijie ki kuch locha jarur he
 You can also be falsely implicated

 a common method of establishing gossip victims or bullying is to spread rumors and to do evil to others
 kuch log chillane ke bajaay is ranneeti par zyada amal karte hai
 6
 aap alag-thaledgar aapako meeting,offis lunch yaa kisi soshal meeting se dur rakhaa ja rahaa he, to kuch gadabad he
 If the boss is changing your seat and banging you somewhere in the corner, then it is also bad luck
 7
 If you are taking a vacation at home only because you feel like staying away from the office, then this is a sign of your becoming a victim
 8
 Information is not given? It is possible that the person who makes you an enemy is sitting in hiding with valuable information, in which your work is not being completed
 yah aapako naakaam karne kii koshish ho sakati he
 9
 aap par zyada boj?agar aapako lagata he ki aapse sabase zyada kaam liya ja rahaa he or dedline baar-baar badali ja rahi he, to dikkat he
 Keeping a meeting if you are not in office is also similar
 10
 No credit to you? If you are working diligently on a project, but you are not being given credit for it, then it is also a sign of office begging
 saath hi kai baar aapkaa bos, aapkaa credit bhi khud yaa kisi or ko bhi de saktaa he

 lalit modi ko madad maamle main ab tak koi dastaveji saboot na hone kii baat kahkar batch raheen rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje kii mushkilen bad gai hai
 The new revelations of the Congress have certainly increased the troubles of the Modi government, which calls for morality
 lekin party kisi tarah kii jaldbaaji main kadam nahin uthaanaa chaahati
 Raje, in his clarification to the party high command, had earlier distanced himself from Lalit Modi's dealings with his son Putushyant Singh
 sidhe raaje par koi akshep nahin tha, isliye der se hi sahi, party alaakaman ko raaje ke bachaav main utarana padaa tha
 Raje himself had expressed his ignorance of any kind of document and the signature on it
 lekin jis tarah se vipakshi congress ne mudde kii nabj pakad lee he or sarkaar par dabaav badha diya he usase nipatane main bijepi kaa haalat post ho rahi he
 Raje cannot write such a letter? Even though the top leadership of the BJP still believes that the kind of language written in the letter cannot be expected even from a novice politician
 aise main vasundhara raaje is tarah kii bhashaa vaali chitthee par dastakhat kar sakati hai yah sahi prathit nahin hota
 a senior leader associated with the party and the Sangh believes, "raje is a keen political player and she cannot write a letter with such language in any case that my testimony is not shared with the investigating agency or government of our country
 Go 'bijepi ab bhi chitthee or raaje ke dastakhat kii jaanch kaa intjaar kar rahi he or philhal raaje ko andeh kaa laabh dena chaahati he
 There is also political compulsion of the party behind it because Raje has been established as a satrap in Rajasthan and his forced resignation means to tear the party
 shuruaati anakani ke baad bijepi ke sheersh netritv kaa raaje ke bachaav main der se aane kaa kaaran bhi yahi mana ja rahaa he
 The government does not want to come under the pressure of the opposition, besides this kind of resignation before the Bihar elections, it can be a fatal step for the BJP which is lagging behind in the political summer
 bijepi ke ek varisht ranneetikaar kaa kahana he ki videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ke baad vasundhara raaje kaa mudda jis tarah saamne aayaa uske baad sarkaar or party main sheersh str par yah tay kiya gaya ki sarkaar ko vipaksh ke dabaav main nahin aana chahie
 He says, "if once the resignation starts, then there is no doubt that in the coming year, in such useless cases, resignation or demand will be flagged and then the atmosphere will be created in the public that corruption has become synonymous
 Like the UPA, the NDA has also died
 ' yahi vajah he ki bijepi-sarkaar kii ranneeti aakhri kshan tak raaje or sushamaa kaa bachaav karne kii he
 But it will not be easy to save Raje, however, in Raje's case, BJP has asked for clarification from him and he is afraid that somewhere in Delhi the former Law Minister Jitendra Singh Tomar kept Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the dark, in the same way, towards Raje Neither should be isliye party ne unase saaf taur par is nae khulaase ko lekar apana paksh rakhane kaa nirdesh diya he
 For the first time, in Raje's case, defending the high command level, party spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi had called the resignation question hypothetical, but also added that if some new facts emerge in this case, the party will investigate and decide further 
 ab bhi party kii ranneeti isi bayaan ke ird-gird he
 If truth is found in the disclosure of the letter in Raje's case, then it will not be easy for the BJP high command to save Raje
 kam se kam bihar chunaav tak maamla taalna chaahati he partyparty kii ranneeti is maamle main saaf he ki raaje ke khilaaf hue is nae khulaase ko kam se kam bihar chunaav tak taala jaae or is bich andruni jaanch ke jariye sachai kaa pataa lagaaya jaae
 For this, the party and the government are also ready to allow the monsoon session of Parliament to be an uproar as the opposition Congress has already made its strategy clear in this matter
 bijepi ke ek netaa kaa kahana he ki congress kaa hangaamaa bhi vaisaa hi hoga jaisaa vipaksh main rahete bijepi ne bhi kai muddon par kiya tha
 Apart from these strategies, BJP is currently looking badly surrounded on the issue of morality
 ek taraf videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj or rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje par desh ke kanoon se faraar lalit modi kii madad karne kaa aarope he to duusari taraf maharashtra main divangat gopinath munde kii beti or devendra fadanvis sarkaar main mantri pankaja munde par bhi ghotaale kaa aarope lag gaya he
 In such a situation, it will be very interesting to see how BJP gets out of this vortex

 If you will make the law then i can definitely 'bharat Mata Ki Jai' but you cannot force me
 ovaisine aage kaha ki ise aap meri rashtriyata kaa test nahin bana sakate hai
 He further said, 'I feel proud to speak Jaihind
 ye to angrejon se lade bhi nahin the, tab se naaraa aayaa he jai hind kaa
 How i spend my life in my house, what i eat, what i say, it is my right to privacy

 Owaisi further said that the Modi government failed on other issues including security of the country, inflation
 iske alaava musalmaan or daliton ke khilaaf nafrat kaa maahaul bana diya gaya he
 i think the people of Hindustan will vote on these issues only

 After the CLP, the Congress claimed that 76 out of 79 mlas were present in the legislature party meeting

 congress vidhayak dal ke netaa siddharmaiya ne jis lahaze main party vidhayakon ko chetavanee di thi, usase unki hataasha or dar kaa pataa chalata he
 Siddaramaiah is in awe: Yeddyurappad: On the other hand, Yeddyurappa attacked Siddaramaiah saying that the way you have sent a notice to the mlas for not attending the meeting, your frustration comes to know
 isse pataa chalata he ki aap khauf main hai
 If you have a cordial relationship with the mlas then why did you write in the notice that they will be taken action under the defection law
 maaloom ho ki shuukravaar ko congress kii baithak main jo tinvidhayakashamil nahin hue unke naam ramesh jarakiholi, mahesh kumatahalli or umesh jadhav hai
 MLA Umesh Jadhav wrote a letter to Siddaramaiah while clarifying that he was unable to travel due to poor health, due to which he did not attend this meeting, due to which he would not be able to attend the meeting
 inke alaava bi
 mlas named Nagendra also did not attend the meeting
 unhone kaha ki ek adalati maamle kii vajah se vah vidhayak dal kii baithak main shaamil nahin ho sakenge
 After this, Siddaramaiah said that the party will send show cause notices to the mlas who are absent in the meeting
 congress kii samskritiyediurppa ne congress mahasachiv ke si venugopal kii us tippanee kii bhi aalochana kii ki karnataka main varsh 2008 main oparation lotus shuru hua tha
 Yeddyurappa said that it was the Congress that started the 'aya Ram Gaya Ram' culture
 vidhayakon kii is dalbadalu pravriti kaa anya dalon par bhi asar padaa
 He said that in the year 1967, the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had said that 'gaya Ram has now become Aya Ram'
 isi saal unki sanyukt morcha sarkaar kaa ek vidhayak party main shaamil hua or 15 din ke antaraal main usne teen baar congress chodi thi
 Yeddyurappane said that it would be better if Siddaramaiah and Venugopal study their political history and find out what happened in Haryana when the Congress formed Bhajanlal's government with the help of 36 Janata Party mlas
 yediurppa ne kaha ki congress ne hi yah samskruti shuru kii
 He said that Siddaramaiah seems to have forgotten that he too joined the Congress under this culture
 bhartiya janata party ko satta kaa laalach nahin he

 Actually, Shivpal's attitude has come loose after the SP-BSP alliance because Mulayam Singh Yadav was also in favor of this alliance from day one and Shivpal too has great expectations in this alliance
 shivpal ke kareebi sutron ke mutabik akhilesh or shivpal ke bich do daur kii baatcheet bhi ho chuki he
 Akhilesh also feels that the family feud caused heavy losses to the party in the assembly elections, so it is necessary to take the family along

 Sheikh Mohammad, who hails from Multan, arrived at a lion cage rather than a mare or a carriage at his wedding
 pinjre main sher maujuud tha, jise dekhne ke liye logon kii bheed umad padi
 The groom said that this was my dream, which his father fulfilled
 shaikh mohammad kishadi bilkul shahiandaaj se hui, unki shaadi main lagbhag 15 hajaar mehmaan pahunche
 At the same time, about 5 crore Pakistani rupees were given to the groom by the girl, who were also kept to show at the wedding program
 bainkon / NBFC kii hichkichaahat se logon ko vittiya madad milane main dereeenechabi ne kaha, sabsidi ke data kaa rajyavar vibhaajan uplabdh nahin'sabake liye awaas' ke uddeshy se laai gai modi sarkaar kii flagship yojana ko braker kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Those who are eligible to buy housing for the first time under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (urban) are having to wait long to get subsidy
 ye log pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat credit lincd sabsidi skim (PMAY-CLSS) ke labhaarthi hai
 In the petition filed under RTI, information was sought from National Housing Bank (NHB) on pending applications under PMAY-CLSS
 NHB ne jawaab main bataaya, '22-08-19 ko 1
 NHB is in process of subsidy claims of 57 lakh housing beneficiaries
 ' NHB ne jawaab main ye bhi kaha ki sabsidi ke data kaa rajyavar vibhaajan unke paas uplabdh nahin he
 According to sources, the hesitation of banks / nbfcs (non-banking financial institutions) is also an important reason for the tortuous pace of providing subsidy under the Pradhan Mantri Awas yojana-urban PMAY (U)
 ye sabsidi ke aavednon par thanda rukh dikhaate hai jisaki vajah se badi sankhya main aise maamle lambit hai
 PMAY (U) aims for 6 first time home buyers under different income slabs
 5% kii byaaj dar vaale home lone par 3 se 18 lakh rupye tak kii sabsidi pradaan kii jaae
 The Grievance Cell of PMAY (U) under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs received several complaints, 62% of which were related to non-subsidy
 2017-18 main, 663 shikaayatein praapt huin
 In 2018-19, this number increased to 1,431, out of which 907 were resolved by 12 June 2019
 NHB ko 1,719 shikaayatein milin, jinamein se 1,346 kaa nistaaran ho gaya or 373 lambit thim
 In a review meeting of the scheme headed by the Prime Minister's Office, the officials had cited the lack of funds with NHB as an important reason, but denied any shortage of funds when feedback from the ministry officials was sought
 unhone kaha ki sabsidi aavednon kaa samaybaddh dhang se nistaaran kiya ja rahaa he
 For this, an additional budgetary resource (EBR) allocation of 60,000 crores is being used
 maujuuda vitt varsh main, awaas yojana ke liye bajtiy aavanton 7,000 karod rupee he, jiskaa puri tarah se upyog kiya gaya he
 Sources confirm that Rs 28,000 crore was withdrawn from the EBR to meet the subsidy requirements
 iske alaava, vitt varsh 2017-18 kii tulana main is varsh PMAY-CLSS kii maang main lagbhag 285% kii vruddhi hui he
 The hesitation of banks / nbfcs for supply of more funds is evident from the fact that in July 2019, the EBR required for HUDCO was not approved by the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA)
 7 lakh labhaarthiyon ke lakshya ko praapt karne ke liye, NHB ko 15,400 karod rupye kii aavashyaktaa he
 Of this, the Ministry of Housing claims that the fund of Rs 10,350 crore acquired in 2018-19 has been disbursed
 is saal ke shuru main sansad ke ek jawaab main, awaas or shahari maamalon ke mantri hardip singh puri ne kaha tha ki july 2019 tak, sarkaar ne PMAY-CLSS ke tahat 14,482 karod rupye kii sabsidi 6
 43 lakh beneficiaries were distributed
 abhi jitne aavedan (1
 57 lakhs) are in the process, if they get subsidy, then the total number of beneficiaries will reach 8 lakhs
 vitt varsh 2019-20 ke liye lakshya 10 lakh labhaarthiyon ko cover karne kaa rakhaa gaya he
 However, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs proposed in a meeting that to achieve this target, NHB should cover around 7 lakh beneficiaries
 vahiin HUDCO ko 50,000 se zyaada or SBI ko kam se kam 2
 5 lakh beneficiaries must see

 Senior leaders Ambika Soni and Ghulam Nabi Azad are also expected to be present at the meeting
 dobaaraa satta hasil karne kii raah main congress kisi tarah kii kami nahin chhodana chaahati
 The Congress and the Samajwadi Party strongly criticized the Narendra Modi government for the ceasefire violations on the part of Pakistan, while the ruling BJP has taken a tough stance saying that Indian forces are capable of giving a befitting reply to a country which is 'terrorists'
 ' has been made
 bijepi netaa mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne kaha, pakistan ab vah pakistan nahin he, vah ab 'shaitanistan' ban gaya he
 
 
 He has now become a 'terrorist'
 hamaari sena jaanati he ki aise 'shaitanistan' or 'aatankistan' se kaise nipatna he or use karaara jawaab de rahi he
 BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli also hit out at Pakistan, saying that it has decided that it will not be deterred by its conduct
 unhone kaha ki raksha mantri arun jetali ne desh ko bataa diya he ki hamaari sena or seemaa suraksha bal sthiti se nipatane or uchit jawaab dene main sakasham hai
 Kohli also said that when such a violation took place during the previous regime, no strict stand was taken against Pakistan
 congress pravaktaa abhishek singhvi ne modi sarkaar kii aalochana kii
 He said, Pakistan challenges us on a regular basis, plays with our honor and damages property and we are not able to do anything
 ham sirf aankade dete hai
 Singhvi said that the Hon'ble Prime Minister, who talks extensively about nationalism, has not given even a single line statement
 unhone desh ko nahin bataaya he ki is par roak lagane ke liye kya thos kadam uthaae gaye hai
 It is a shame samaajawaadee party ke mahasachiv naresh agarwal ne bhi modi or bijepi par kadaa prahaar kiya
 He said that those we considered strong turned out to be weak
 jise hamane puri takat di, ve iskaa istemaal karne main vifal rahe
 We are not able to answer it in the way that a small country like Pakistan is threatening India and is engaged in regular firing in our area
 raajnneetik dalon kii yah pratikriya aise samay main ai he, jab pakistani suraksha balon dwaara jammu-kashmir main antarrashtriya seemaa par kii gai baari golabari se aaj ek parivaar kii do mahilaon kii jaan chali gai, jabaki 15 anya ghayal ho gaye
