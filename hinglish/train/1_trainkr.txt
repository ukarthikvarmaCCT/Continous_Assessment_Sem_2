 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has won the trust vote in the assembly
 bijepi-jediu kii sarkaar ke paksh main 131 vot pade or vipaksh main 108 vot
 After the trust vote, Tejashwi Yadav attacked Nitish Kumar fiercely
 tejasvi ne kaha ki vishwaas mat ke khilaaf rajd or congress ne vot diya he
 In 2015, the BJP was voted against, the grand alliance got the vote
 nitish ne bihar kaa apmaan kiya he
 If you had to go with BJP then why have you formed four governments in four years
 chaar saal main chaar sarkaar ek hi vyakti ke liye banaai gai
 We asked for an appointment with the Governor, but we were not given time
 aaj bhi hamanen gupt matdaan kii maang thi, lekin spikar ne hamaari baat nahin maani
 All the mlas were taken captive by the BJP
 tejasvi ne kaha ki 28 saal kaa noujvaan kisi ke aage nahin jhukaa par ye to manze hue khilaadi the phir bhi RSS-BJP ke saamne ghutane tech die
 He said that Nitish Kumar has joined hands with the killers of Gandhi and the descendants of Godse
 tejasvi ne kaha ki kuch samay pehle nitish kumaar ne piem modi ke liye ek kavita sunai thi
 i want to remind them today
 bahati hawa sa tha wo, gujarat se aayaa thakala dhan laane vaala tha wo, kahaan gaya use dhundhohamako desh kii phikr sataati he, wo bas videsh kaa daura lagata hehamako badhati mahangaai sataati he, har vakt apni selfi khinchvaate handaood ko laane vaala tha wo, kahaan gaya use dhundhopurvaupamukhyamantri tejasvi yadavane kaha ki main is prastaav ke virodh main khadaa hum

 com / zz9lkvwvpd— Tejashwi Yadav (@yadavtejashwi)july 28, 2017tejasvi ne hamalavar rukh akhriyaar karte hue kaha ki lalu ji pehle se aaropee hai phir kyon nitish kumaar gathbandhan kiye
 Nitish Kumar went to Motihari, sitting in front of Gandhiji, his real face was not revealed at that time, today the real face was revealed
 bijepi ke saath chale gaye, nathuram godse ke samarthakon ke saath chale gaye
 We are alone enough
 nitish kumaar dar gaye, natmastak ho gaye, ranchhod ho gaye
 Laluji was not tempted by his younger brother
 agar laluji swaarthee hote to badi party hone ke naate hamaara CM hota
 We stand on the principle and idea pic
 twitter
 com / vo4nylzwoh — Tejashwi Yadav (@yadavtejashwi) July 28, 2017 He said that now the public will not trust Nitish Kumar
 he ram se palati maar karke jai shri ram main chale gaye
 Nitish Kumar is facing trial for murder
 susheel modi par bhi 104 kaa mukadmaa chal rahaa he phir mujhe kyon nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Even after being the largest party, the Governor did not give us a chance
 rajyapal nitish se milane aate hai or phir aspataal chale jate hai
 He further said that Nitish Kumar was abused by DNA, then with which mouth he went to BJP
 nitish kumaar kaa vyaktigat taur par ham sammaan karte hai lekin raajnneetik rup se nitish kumaar ne galat kiya he, bijepi ke saath baithe hai
 We are sorry ek nirdosh ko fansaa kar, parivaar ko badnaam karke bijepi ke saath janaa galat he
 Nitish Kumar would have spoken
 aap istipha maangate to hamaari party or main jarur is baat par sochate
 If Lalu ji had a son, Lalu would have made us the chief minister, but he had brother fascination, that's why Nitish should be made the chief minister
 ab nitish kumaar bijepi ke sabhi mukhyamantri kaa istipha maangenge
 Did crores of rupees be found at Giriraj's house, Nitish Kumar will ask for his resignation
 kya nitish kumaar ab desh me anti neshnal mudde par bijepi kaa virodh karenge
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that in order to become globally competitive, India now needs to move to a lower level of taxation

 If sources are to be believed, the government is considering increasing the existing tax exemption limit to Rs 4 lakh
 vartmaan main tex chhot kii limit 2,50,000 rupee he
 If there is a change in the tax slab, then earning up to 4 lakhs will be exempt from paying tax
 vitt mantri ne iske saath hi tex chori ko lekar kaha ki ab wo daur ja rahaa he jab sarkaar se tex chura lenaa koi gambhir baat nahin thi
 It is the responsibility of every citizen to pay the tax which is made and those who do not do so have to face very serious consequences
 unhone kaha ki beete 70 saalon se ham log isi soch main jite rahe ki sarkaar se tex kii chori main koi buraai nahin he
 It was seen as commercial smartnas
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar aisi vyavastha or dhaancha banane ja rahi he jisase ki log swayan kar adaa kar sakenge
 No intention to tax long-term capital gains: Jaitley also made it clear earlier that the government had no intention of levying tax on long-term capital gains in the sale and purchase of shares
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke mumbai ke ek kaarykram ke bhaashan ke sandarbh main jetali ne kaha ki modi ke bhaashan kii media main jo vyakhya kii gai, vah sahi nahin he
 He clarified, a media reporter misinterpreted that speech and began to imply that it indirectly indicated a tax on long-term capital gains in securities trading
 yah vyakhya bilkul galat he
 He said, the Prime Minister did not make any such statement, directly or indirectly, so i want to make it very clear that there is no basis for anyone to come to this conclusion because the Prime Minister has not said anything nor the government's There is an intention as stated in the media

 Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are now divided into two parts
 pehle rajya tha ab centre shasit pradesh ho gaya
 The post of Chief Minister has ended
 rajyapal kaa pad samaapt ho gaya
 Like Delhi, there will be the post of lieutenant governor and the police will be with the central government
 jammu kashmir centre shasit pradesh hoga
 Ladakh will be a separate union territory
 ladakh main vidhansabha nahin hogi
 Home Minister Amit Shah introduced the Jammu and Kashmir Amendment Bill 2019 in the Rajya Sabha and also passed after debate
 ise loksabhaa main paas karana mushkil nahin hoga
 Now it can be analyzed on three scales
 prakriya, pratikriya or prabhaav
 First come to the response
 shesh bharat main jashn manaate hue in tasviren bataa rahi hai ki kashmir ko lekar aam logon main ek chhavi or samaj he
 Which has been going on for many years
 is samaj main bhale hi tamaam baarikiyaan na hon magar bijepi or sangh lambey samay se logon ke man main samaj banane main kaamyaab rahi ki dhara 370 ke rahete kashmir bharat kaa puraa hissaa nahin he
 Even if the authors of the book on Article 370 say that the understanding of the people is incomplete, but the truth is that a large number of people from the rest of India have the opposite opinion
 yah jashn unheen dharanaon kii pratikriya main he
 This is the reason why many people say that people want to hear what the government has done about Kashmir today
 tark or tathy se koi phayda nahin
 The country has changed
 is raay kii aandhi main unki raay patton kii tarah ud rahi he jinke kuch sawaal hai
 Amit Shah also said that don't believe me, watch TV
 tivi par swaagat hi swaagat he
 You go home and watch TV
 People believe that Kashmir will be cured
 jab janata kaa itnaa vishwaas he to meraa bhi he
 What does Kashmir want, does it have an opinion in this decision? What is the reaction of Ladakh and Jammu? No one was aware of how Kashmir has been breathing for the past several hours
 kashmir kii ab kya raay he kisi ko pataa nahin
 All contacts and networks have been controlled
 mahabuuba mufti ko giraftaar kar liya gaya he
 Omar Abdullah has also been arrested
 pehle nazarband kiya gaya tha
 The National Conference has three mps in the Lok Sabha
 rajyasabha main pidipi ke do saansad hai
 They were not separatists, then why were they not consulted
 kaha gaya ki pidipi or neshnal conference kuch pariwaron kaa maamla he, unke apane hit hai dhara 370 main, 370 ke kaaran vahaan bhrashtachar bad gaya he, garibi ho gai he or aatankwaad bad gaya he
 If these problems are there in other states also, should the status of the state be reduced there and many parts of it should be changed in the Union Territory
 aakhir vahaan ke raajnneetik dalon ko is prakriya kaa hissaa kyon nahin banaaya gaya
 In October 1947, hundreds of National Conference activists were killed in combat when the Pakistani army attacked Kashmir
 bharat kii sena pahunchane se pehle kashmir kii aam janata ne pakistan kaa muqabla kiya tha, apni jaan di thi
 Kashmir remained quiet amidst the terrible violence of the partition of 1947
 vahaan dange nahin hue
 Gandhi had said that this brotherhood of Kashmir is the hope of India
 aapako yah nahin bataaya jayega ki aatankwaadiyon ne neshnal conference ke saikadon kaaryakartaaon ko isliye maaraa kyonki ve bhartiya samvidhan ke saath the
 You will not be told that the terrorists also killed the Congress workers
 aapako yah nahin bataaya jayega ki pidipi ke saath kuch din pehle tak bijepi kii vahaan saajha sarkaar chal rahi thi
 Terrorists continued to target the National Conference
 kya in sabhi se kisi tarah kii raay lee gai, agar aap yah sawaal karenge to sabhi ko algaavvaadiyon ke saath khadaa kar diya jayega
 There has been a backlash from Kashmiri Pandits living in Delhi, Jammu and elsewhere and there is a lot of enthusiasm among them
 kashmiri panditon ke prashn kaa uttar baaki he
 What happened to him makes the whole debate unfounded
 isliye aaj kashmiri pandit apni jeet ke rup main dekh rahe hai
 Did he not mention whether he would go back now, or would there be circumstances to go
 kam se kam amit shah ne sadan main is bare main kuch nahin kaha
 Nevertheless the Kashmiri Pandits welcomed the decision and called it historic
 media aapako nahin batayega ki ghati main 6000 kashmiri pandit ab bhi rahete hai
 What brotherhood do they live in, what is their experience, many thousands of Sikhs also live in the valley, speak Kashmiri
 chitthisinghpura main aatankwaadiyon ne sikhon ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya tha lekin usee aatank prabhavit kashmir ke gaanvon main sikh parivaar kaise rahete hai hamen nahin bataaya jaataa he
 The story of that brotherhood is probably not for political profits
 inaki vaapasi par rajya ke sabhi dalon kaa yahi stand he ki unka swaagat he lekin vaapasi nahin hui yah tathy he
 Whatever happened to Kashmiri Pandits has a deep wound
 is faisle se raajnneetik adhikaar bhi prabhavit hua he
 The voters of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh used to vote for the full state, now they will vote for the union territory i
e
 their political identity has been halved and the authority has been reduced to half
 kuch dinon se kashmir main sena kii tainaati ho rahi thi
 Contacts were being terminated
 rajyapal bayaan de rahe the ki unhen pataa nahin he, kal kya hoga pataa nahin he
 Satyapal Malik kept saying that there is no plan to remove 35-A
 na hi rajya ko teen hisson main baantne kii yojana he
 Satyapal Malik also said on June 12 that section 370 is not being removed, even two days ago his statement in Indian Express printed that section 370 will not be tampered with
 itnaa bada faisla ho rahaa tha rajyapal ko na to do din pehle pataa tha, na do maheenaa pehle pataa tha or raashtrapati kaa aadesh kahata he ki rajyapal kii manzuri le lee gai he
 Now only Satyapal Malik's constitutional moral sense can tell if he was right
 ab yahaan par vakil gautam bhaatia ne sawaal uthaaya he
 Consider this question
 rajyapal to centre kaa pratinidhi hota he wo kab se rajya kii awaz ho gaya
 That is why we said what is the decision process
 do tihaai bahumat se rajyasabha main bill paas hua lekin aisa kyon hua ki rajyapal se lekar raajnneetik dal bekhbar the
 Even the ally Janata Dal United said that they had no inkling
 satyapal malik samaajawaadee kheme se aate hai
 Janata Dal United is also from the same stream
 vaise duusare samaajawaadee jaise samaajawaadee party ne is faisle main saath diya he
 Amit Shah repeatedly said that we will make Kashmir a heaven
 bharosa rakhen
 You also have to think about what Kashmir got from the stay of Article 370, what will be gained by the removal of Article 370
 kaha ja rahaa he ki rojgaar ke avasar badhenge lekin kya iske liye kisi kaa raajnneetik adhikaar kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Like whether UP can be made a Union Territory that employment opportunities will increase there
 yah bhi tathy he ki dhara 370 khokhla ho chukaa tha
 Amit Shah himself has said that Congress has also amended section 370 in 1952 and 1967
 yahaan par samvidhan visheshgy gautam bhaatia ne ek baat kahi he
 Till now, section 370 was used to change other provisions
 yah pehali baar hua he ki dhara 370 kaa istamaal hua he, 370 ko hi hataane main
 Amit Shah is saying that there was corruption in Jammu and Kashmir
 yah sahi bhi he
 But whether on this basis the status of a state can be reduced, it can be divided
 yah bhi kamaal he
 The economy is in crisis
 factriyaan band ho rahi hai
 Employment is going on, but the status of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh has been changed so that there will be employment, factories run
 ayushmaan ko lekar sawaal to shesh bharat main bhi he
 Where are the government hospitals, where are the doctors
 amit shah jin aankadon ko pard rahe hai wo kashmir hi nahin duusare rajyon ke bare main yahi kaha ja saktaa he kya unka bantwaaraa bhi is tarah se kiya ja saktaa he
 So now Hindu Musmalan and Sikh will get reservation in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir
 pehle nahin miltaa tha
 The history of Kashmir is very complex and this decision too
 jab tab sarkarein barkhaast kii gayi or chunaav jaise taise karaae gaye
 Amit Shah himself, in his earlier speech in the Lok Sabha, had told what kind of fraud was used in the state elections
 aaj yah baat koi or kah de to deshadrohi kaha jaae lekin desh ke grahamantri ne hi bataaya tha ki kashmir main chunaav ke naam par kya ho rahaa tha
 Not only this, but also listen to the statement of Union Minister of State Jitendra Singh which he has said in Lok Sabha
 ve kashmir ke nirvaachit pratinidhiyon ko 8-10 pratishat vot kaa labharathi bataa rahe the
 Now there is no use to ask the question whether the rest of Kashmir had agreed to this decision
 sarkaar ne har tarah se samajhane kii koshish kii ki jammu kashmir rajya kaa punargathan bahut zaruri tha
 While celebrating, the constitution experts keep saying that Article 370 is not removed
 uske do praavdhaan samaapt hue hai
 It was said at the time of demonetisation that terrorism in the valley will end
 nahin hua
 It is now being said that Article 370 is at the root of terrorism
 amit shah ne dhara 370 hi nahin hataaya balki itihaas bhi badal diya
 He said that it is said incorrectly that Sardar Patel wanted to give Kashmir to Pakistan
 ise sadan ke ricard main na rakhaa jaae
 He said that Nehru was handling Kashmir
 kah diya ki sadan ke ricard main na ho
 Amit Shah also wanted to change history today
 sardaar patel ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki ve kashmir ko pakistan ko de dena chaahate the
 It cannot happen, there is no need to bring it on record
 sardaar patel ko lekar amit shah ne jo daawa kiya itihaas kii kitabon main usase alag daawey hai
 Rajmohan Gandhi has written in a biography of Sardar Patel in 439 that Sardar Patel wrote a letter to Baldev Singh on 13 September 1947 that if Kashmir joins Pakistan, they will accept it
 baad main patel kaa nazariyaa badal gaya jab pataa chalaa ki pakistan ne junagarh ke vilay ko sweekaar kar liya tha
 On 26 June 2018, The Print has an article by Srinath Raghavan
 ve likhte hai ki 15-16 may 1949 ko patel ke nivas main dhara 370 kii baithak shuru hui thi
 After that Patel wrote to Nehru that i have prepared the Congress to accept Article 370
 kashmir kaa masalaa akele nehru handle nahin kar rahe the or na hi sardaar patel hyderabad or junagarh kaa masalaa
 Repeated questions arose as to why the status of the state was reduced
 vahaan to vaise bhi centre kaa shashan chal rahaa he
 Army is present
 iskaa jawaab amit shah ne diya or kaha ki jab sthiti narmal hogi centre shasit pradesh se waapas rajya banaaenge
 So one temporary provision was removed and another temporary provision was brought
 rajya se centre shasit pradesh kar dene main aatank se kaise behatar ladaa ja saktaa he iskaa spasht jawaab nahin mila
 Maybe not even needed
 sthiti ke saamaanya hone kii paribhaasha kya he, vah sarkaar hi tay karegi
 Amit Shah has asked the youth to trust the Modi government, change will happen in 5 years
 unhen kuch nahin hoga to kya agle paanch saal tak ke liye centre shasit pradesh banaaya gaya he
 Eight parties have protested
 basapa, bijedy or aam aadmi party, wiesar, eidiemke ne saport kiya he
 Eight parties including Congress, National Conference, PDP, RJD, Trinamool Congress, Janata Dal United have protested
 is puure ghatnakram ko antarrashtriya nazar se bhi dekhnaa chahie
 a few days ago, the President of the United States was talking about India's mediation in the Kashmir problem
 bharat ne turant khandan kiya
 The message that India has done today would have sent a message to America as well
 lekin kya yah messej messej kii kootneeti afghanistan ko lekar bhi he jahaan kabhi bharat ko badhat thi or ab america pakistan ko mahatv de rahaa he
 Let us once again tell that Article 370 related to Jammu and Kashmir has not been removed
 dhara 370 samvidhan ke bhaag 21 kaa hissaa he or ise samvidhan sanshodhan ke bina nahin hataaya ja saktaa he
 Part 21 of the Constitution talks about three types of provisions
 sankramanakalin yani fori, asthaayee, vishesh praavdhaan
 Article 370 related to Jammu and Kashmir comes under temporary provision of the Constitution
 anuchhed 370 ke tahat teen bindu hai
 370 (1) states that in consultation with the Government of Jammu and Kashmir, various articles of the Constitution can be applied to Jammu and Kashmir by order of the President
 jabaki anuchhed 370 (2) or 370 (3) jammu-kashmir ko kai vishesh adhikaar dete hai
 The provisions 370 (2) and 370 (3) giving many special rights to Jammu and Kashmir have been removed using 370 (1) and the remaining provisions of the Constitution of the country have been applied to Jammu and Kashmir
 35e bhi inhen praavdhaanon ke tahat lagaaya gaya tha jise hataa diya

 The book's chapter on the camp of the displaced is of special interest to Indian readers
 isamen lekhak ne mujaffarabad main pakistan sarkaar dwaara chalaae ja rahe ek aise sharnaarthi shivi kaa vivaran diya he jisamen bhartiya jammu-kashmir se bhagkar aae kashmiri rahete hai
 There are about 35,000 Kashmiri idiots in 15 such camps in pok, fed up with the 'excesses' of the Indian Army or in Pakistan seeking 'independence'
 bataaya gaya ki pakistan sarkaar har sharnaarthi ko har maheene 750 pakistani ru
 (indian 600 Rs
 ) detii he
 The author's comment on the camp's dreary condition is, "we immediately understood why the children of the families of begging at Geelani Chowk are begging?" The hotel (muzaffarabad), where we were stationed, went out to search for a shop from a tea cage and then proceeded to the local famous Geelani Chowk

 a post shared by Jacqueline Fernandez (@jacquelinef143) on Jun 16, 2017 at 7:08am PDTA post shared by Jacqueline Fernandez (@jacquelinef143) on Jun 29, 2017 at 4:34am PDT You may have heard and seen the story of beating and beating many times, but many times it becomes difficult to decide who is actually a goon? The one who is beating or the one who is beating him? Apart from the bravery of the Indore police, there are some stories of bullying by the police that turn justice into a crime
 khaas baat yah bhi he ki yah sab camere ke saamne aane kii chahat main he
 What a slap, what a stick, what a kick and a gag? bas yah samaj lijie ki is kahani main har ansh thappad, laat, lathi, ghusaa or gaali se sajaa he or yah sidhe-sidhe kanoon ko thenga dikhaa rahaa he
 Every action is directly challenging our tradition of justice
 pulisia julm kii yah kahani baar-baar yahi sawaal doharaati he ki hindustan kii koun si adaalat police ko ye haq detii he ki wo yun kisi ko saream sajaa de
 Want to come in front of the camera In fact, out of all such pictures of the Indore Police in recent times, most of the pictures have been taken by the cameraman of only one local channel
 indore police jab bhi 'singhm' banane ke mood main aati he us local channel ke cameraman or reporter ko bula leti he
 Then the whole scene is arranged according to their camera
 ab usee camere se jo sabase nai or taaja tasviren ai hai use indore main gunda abhiyaan ke naam se shuru kii gai indore police kii nai muhim kaha gaya he
 Under this campaign, on the road and on camera, the police consider themselves to be heroes by catching small goons
 jabaki isi indore main saal bhar main ausatan sau se zyada katl, sava sau ke kareeb hatya kii koshish, 60 ke kareeb kidnaping, sau ke aasapaas rape, do sau ke kareeb dakaiti ke maamle darj hote hai
 More than half of these cases are not even solved by the Indore police, because those whom they catch are acquitted from the court due to lack of evidence
 sadak par gundon kaa juluus or camerapichhali farvari main hamane aapako bataaya tha ki indore police shahar main aparaadhiyon kii jamaat ko kam karne ke liye or shahar main apana rutaba badhaane ke liye chhutbhayye aparaadhiyon kaa juluus nikaal rahi he
 But after this news, Indore Police stopped this exercise for a few days
 lekin ab ek baar phir sab puraane dharre par laut aayaa he
 Once again a procession of miscreants was taken out in the streets and streets of the city
 lekin ek nae andaaz main
 The Indore police, which is giving the name of Gunda Abhiyan, is actually trying to make himself Surma in front of the camera
 iske tahat thane ke bich do shaks ko hathkadiyon main jakadaaa jaataa he or unhe pulisavaale gher kar khadey ho jate hai
 Now in 'singham style' police officers make slaps of rain
 ab camera duusari taraf ghumta he
 On this side too, two more men are tied in handcuffs
 lekin police afasar vahi hai

 artiai ke jawaab se hua khulhasatin saal main kharch kiye 1
 52 crore Western Railway has responded in response to an RTI application that it spent Rs 1,52,41,689 in three years for spraying of paste control (rat killing drug) in its premises
 pashchimi railway, bhartiya railway kaa sabase chota jone he jo mukhya taur par pashchimi bharat se uttar bharat ko jodne valirelonka sanchaalan karata he
 In response to this RTI, the Railways has said that it spent Rs 1,52,41,689 in three years and 5,457 rats were killed by this expenditure
 agar ausat nikaala jaae to railway ne yard or rail coach main paste control chhidkaav par pratidin 14 hajaar rupee kharch kiye
 After this huge expense, only 5 rats were killed every day
 haalanki, pashchimi railway ke mukhya jansampark adhikari ravinder bhaakar ne kaha ki is tarah kaa nishkarsh nikaalnaa anuchit he
 He said, "it is unfair to compare the total expenditure with the killed ones
 agar ham yah dekhen ki kul milakar hamane kya praapt kiya he to yah aankada nirdhaarit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 One of these advantages is that in the last two years, there has been a decrease in the incidence of signal failure due to the disconnection of the mice wire compared to before
 "railway coach or yard main kiton or kutarne vaale jaanwaron jaise chuhon ke khatre ko niyantrit karne ke liye railway visheshgy agenciyon kii sevaayen letaa he
 These agencies control the problem of pests and rats by spraying paste in railway rolling stock, station premises and adjoining yard
 kiton or chuhon kii samasya par prabhaavshaalee niyantran sunishchit karne ke liye vibhinhtakanigpanai jaati he, jaise- chamagadad, gond board, kuch apruv kiye gaye chemical or jaal aadi kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 a schedule has been prepared for each train for the purpose of spraying pesticides
 kitnashak ke chhidkaav se pehle train ke har coach main pehle dry sweeping yani jhaadu lagaai jaati he
 The chemical is changed at fixed times to increase the effect
 pentry car ke maamle main plateform par puraa coach khaali kara liya jaataa he, achche se safai kii jaati he, coach main dhuaan kiya jaataa he or phir pentry car ko 48 ghanton ke liye sil kar diya jaataa he
 All this is done at fixed time intervals
 railway ko lagata he ki kiton or chuhon kii is niyantran prakriya ke kaaran use ab tak kaaphi phayda hua he
 Railways say that in recent years there has been a steady reduction in passenger complaints due to the problem of pests and rats
 iske alaava sampatti ko nuksaan se bachaane main bhi safalataa mili he, jaise ki rolling stock, signling instolation, yatriyon ke saamaan aadi nuksaan se bache hai
 Railways have achieved this success through paste control
 railway kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki jagah- jagah paste control chhidkaav kii vajah se chuhon or kiton ne parisar main pravesh nahin kiya he, isliye railway ke paas maare gaye chuhon kii sahi sankhyaupalabdhanheen he
 The railways do not have the correct figures of killed mice to compare the ease with which passengers are now

 According to the report, on 6 October 2015, an intelligence officer met the JNU VC
 tab usne visi se jeenyu main sisitivi camere lagavane par charchaa kii
 The intelligence department official told the VC that in JNU, there are occasional activities in which anti-national colors are seen and objectionable posters are also placed in many hostels

 JDU chief Sharad Yadav once again sparked the controversy on Monday after accusing him of conferring the Padma award on 'beyiman'
 is baar unhone padam puraskaron ke chalan ko band karne kii maang kar daali
 They believe that it 'discriminates' against large sections of people
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘is par roak lagani chahie
 This (padma Award) is for a handful of people who live close to the system
 ’ unhone kaha ki purvavarti ‘janata parivaar’ shasno main kisi ko bhi is prakaar ke aadhikarik sammaan nahin die gaye
 Yadav said that then President APJ Abdul Kalam had sent a note to the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee about 'irregularities' in the honors
 unhone kaha ki is saal ye sammaan anusuchit jati, anusuchit janajati, alpsankhyak or kisaan samudaay se kisi ko bhi nahin die gaye
 When it was discussed that famous actor Dilip Kumar, who is Muslim, has been given the Padma Vibhushan this year, Yadav said that people like Dilip Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan are far ahead of such an identity
 samaajawaadee netaa ne pichley hafte mumbai main ek kaarykram main aarope lagaaya tha ki padam puraskaar sirf ‘beimaan’ logon ko or samaaj ke ucch varg ko die jate hai
 He said that discrimination against socially and economically backward people has been happening for a long time, but this time this discrimination crossed all boundaries in the first year of the Narendra Modi-led government

 There is not as much discrimination in a country as we do
 maine jo kaha he, vah nayaa nahin hai or lambey samay se yah hamaara ruukh rahaa he
 Yadav said that during the Janata Party government that came to power in 1977 and later the United Front government, these honors were not given
 unhone rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke is aarope ko lekar bhi us par nishaanaa saadhaa ki janata parivaar modi sarkaar ke khilaaf asprishyata ko badhaava de rahaa he
 He alleged that discrimination against Muslims and Christians has increased since the BJP came to power

 In this way, all the rights of 'padmavati' will drain the money of the makers
 bhale hi film box offis par kuch zyada na kar paae
 Election Commission's refusal to ban Padmavati, BJP had made the demand for bemars, seeing that the political dispute between them increased, Bhansali has also got the film insured for Rs 160 crore

 The only child of a bank manager who was abducted from Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh was kidnapped and killed

 There was no one else to do this work but only the relatives of the child

 Where Dharampal Singh is the manager of a bank and lives with his wife and son
 beeti 8 june ko dharmpal singh kaabetashutosh shaam kareeb saadhe chaar baje apni bahan tanya ke saath mohalle main hi ek teacher ke ghar tution padhane gaya tha
 The sister left him at the teacher's house
 kuch der baad ashutosh bhi vahaan se niklaa lekin vah ghar nahin lautaa
 Before the housemates came looking for him, Dharampal Singh received a call at his house
 phone karne waalon ne khud ko aparankarta bataate hue kaha ki unka betaa ashutosh unke kabje main he
 The miscreants demanded Rs 25 lakh in exchange for his life on the phone and disconnected the phone
 aparankartaone yah bhi nahin bataaya ki paisa kab or kahaan pahunchaana he
 After this, the police kept on beating hands here and there for 8 days, but nothing of the child was found

 It was then known that no one else but the child's relatives were involved in this entire conspiracy

 Controversy has increased over the statement made by Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee President Kamal Nath regarding women with decorative and quotas
 is mudde par ajtak ke sho 'dangal' main jab congress pravaktaa priyanka chaturvedi se sawaal poocha gaya to unhone cabinet mantri nirmala sitaraman or sushamaa swaraj ko modi sarkaar main sajaavati mantri qaraar diya
 Significantly, when asked by Congress about giving tickets to fewer women candidates, Kamal Nath said, "we have given tickets to all the women candidates who can win the election
" keval kota or sajaavat ke liye hamane is raste ko nahin chunaa
 Kamal Nath's statement gives the BJP a chance to attack the Congress
 party ne ise congress kii mahilaon ke prati kharaab soch kaa udhaaharan bataaya he
 During the discussion on this issue, when Congress spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi was asked in the upcoming show 'dangal', she said that BJP is such a party that has made even the Minister of Defense and Foreign Minister decorative
 priyanka ne kaha ki bijepi mahila virdohi party he or kathua se lekar unnav tak aise tamaam udhaaharan hai, jab ye baat sabit hui he
 BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi, who was present on the show, raised a strong objection to Priyanka's statement
 sudhanshu ne kaha ki ye nirmala sitaraman or sushamaa swaraj kii avmaananaa he
 Sushma ji comes from MP only
 loksabhaa kii spikar sumitra mahajan bhi empi se hai
 Sudhanshu said that the mindset of people who kept the PM decorative for 10 years would be the same
 kya ye hakeekat nahin he ki aaj cabinet cameti on security main 50 fisadi mahilaayein hai
 What happened before? Sudhanshu said that when Indira ji was made PM, she was a dumb doll, later she became powerful
 jab sonia ji ko congress kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya tab ve kitni majboot thim? wo tajposhi bhi sajaavati thi
 This is the mindset of the Congress which is reflected in the statements of its leaders again and again
 sudhanshu kii aapatti par priyanka ne kaha ki meri baat kaa galat matlab nikaala ja rahaa he
 i have said that Sushma ji and Nirmala ji are capable and capable but their abilities are not being used because they are not given the rights, their ministry is being run by someone else
 sudhanshu ji piem manmohan singh ko sajaavati banaae rakhane kaa aarope sonia ji par laga rahe hai jo ki khud ek mahila hai

 Delhi Congress President Ajay Maken made the report of the Fourth Metro Fair Fixation Committee public on Tuesday
 is dauraan maakan ne bada bayaan dete hue kaha he ki yadi dilli sarkaar aane vaale kuch dinon main kiraaya kam nahin karti he to congress bade kiraye par ste lene ke liye court kaa daravaaza khatkhataayegi
 On Tuesday, Ajay Maken said that the report has been lying with the Kejriwal government of the Center and Delhi for the last 15 months, since the report was ready on 8 September 2016 and made public on 26 November 2017

 sharma chauthe fere phikshawsan cameti ke sadsy the to unhone cameti kii baithkon ke dauraan kabhi bhi kiraye badhautari kaa virodh kyon nahin kiya
 While giving a power point presentation, Maken said that in July 2015, Mumbai Metro's Fair Fixation Committee decided to increase the maximum fare of Rs 40 to Rs 110, but Mumbai Metro has increased it by only Rs 5 and increased there
 The fare did not come into force even after 2 years, as the Maharashtra government took a court stay on this issue
 maakan ne arvind kejariwal se poocha ki jabamaharashtra sarkaarne metro kiraaya badhaane par court se ste le liya to dilli sarkaar kyon nahi gai? ajay maakan ne bataaya ki dilli sarkaar 1500 karod dmarsi ko dene kii baat karte hai, jabaki iske liye sirf 755 karod rupee kii sabsidi dene or har saal 7 fisadi kiraaya badhaane se hi metro yadi ghate main he to use roka ja saktaa he
 Ajay Maken has clarified that if the Delhi government does not withdraw the increased rent next week, the Congress will go to court to withdraw the increased rent and bring a stay on the increased rent

 On September 30, the verdict in the fodder scam case has come to an end, but before that the politics of fodder scam is getting hot
 siyasat is baar lalu yadav ke naam se kahin zyada nitish ke naam par ho rahi he
 And no one else but the BJP is doing the work to surround Nitish in the fodder scam, which has not only been with Nitish for 17 years but also together which brought Lalu Yadav from arrogance to the floor on the issue of fodder scam
 darasal jharkhand hycourt ne sibiai ko nirdesh diya he ki chaara ghotaalaa maamle main paisa lene ke nitish kumaar or shivanand tiwari par lage aaropon par halafanama daayar kare ki aakhir unke khilaaf jaanch kyon naa ho

 is faisle se lalu ke rajnatik kariyar kii disha tay hogi lekin isi chaara ghotaale main 22 november ke din kaa intjaar bhi kaiyon ko he kyonki is din chaara ghotaale main ye tay hoga ki kya is maamle main nitish kumaar par mukadmaa chale yaa nahin
 The Jharkhand High Court will hear the cbi's affidavit that it will file in the Nitish and Shivanand Tiwari case
 hycourt ke maamle par sibiai ko halafanama daayar karne ke nirdesh ke saath hi is par siyasat ne apana rang dikhaanaa shuru kar diya he
 BJP is now beginning to talk about keeping both Nitish and Lalu in the same barrack in the fodder scam case

 Now the person who was accused of the fodder scam has not been given a statement in 164, for which reasons the case was affected at that time or the investigation against them was stopped, i do not know

 On the other hand, RJD was probably waiting for the same issue

 RJD Chief Whip in the Bihar Assembly says, "clearly this is a court case but the kind of affidavit filed by the then CBI SP in Patna High Court is clear whether Nitish Kumar or Shivanand Tiwari against everyone Should be investigated
 hamalogon ne to yahi demand vidhansabha ke andar kiya tha or mukhyamantri ne kaha tha ki aap logon kaa badhiya ughed denge
 But the CBI should now clarify how they gave a clean chit to Nitish Kumar
 lekin jedy-you ko nitish ke khilaaf chaara ghotaale par ho rahi siyasat nagavar guzar rahi he

 Significantly, the lower court has rejected the demand for investigation against Nitish Kumar, but on the PIL of Mithilesh Kumar Singh, the High Court has directed the CBI to file an affidavit on why Nitish Kumar and Shivanand Tiwari are not prosecuted in the fodder scam

 yah poochne par ki kya 12 navambar ko vidhansabha main vishwaas-mat jeetne se pehle shivasena ke mantriyon ko unki sarkaar main shaamil kiya jayega, fadanvis ne kaha, 'pehle vishwaas phir vistaar
 ' fadanvis ne kaha ki sarkaar main shivasena kii bhagidaari ke liye 'upyukt str' par baatcheet jari he or is silsile main dilli main ghoshnaa kii jaaegi

 He said on condition of anonymity, 'after listening to Fadnavis, the feeling has strengthened in us that he (BJP) does not want to join us in the government with respect

 ' gujarat ke chunaav se thik pehle rahul gandhi kaa congress party kaa adhyaksh bananaa unke liye sakaaratmak bhi he or chunauteepurn bhi
 Positive because Rahul's changing image contributes to his activism during the Gujarat elections
 adhyaksh banane se pehle rahul jis taiyaari or tevar ke saath gujarat chunaav main utre hai, wo abhootpurv he
 And his confidence is clearly visible
 yah nayaa avatar congress adhyaksh ke rup main unke nae daayitv ko or majboot bhi karata he
 But there are some challenges as well
 or in chunautiyon ke maddenzar rahul kaa gujarat main jeetna yaa behtareen pradarshan karnaa bahut zaruri he
 In fact, just a week after the announcement of his name as the Speaker, the Gujarat and Himachal assembly election results are coming and based on these results Rahul will either be getting applause and he will have to answer some sharp questions
 
 aaie daalate hai ek nazar aise kuch ahm kaarnon par-haari baazi ko jeetna, hamen aata hairahul ke aalochak kehete hai ki unke puure raajnneetik kariyar main keval or keval haar hi basii hui he
 Wherever he went to campaign, the party kept losing
 lekin congress adhyaksh kaa pad unki maa sonia gandhi ke paas hone ke kaaran rahul kii maujuudagi main haar congress party kii haar bhi maani jaati rahi
 Now that he has become the party president and seems to be inhabited among the people in Gujarat rather than as an outsider, the Congress's defeat in this election will be directly defeated
 aalochak kahenge ki chaahe kaman, party or sarvadhikaar rahul ko de do, unki kismat main haar hi he
 a victory in Gujarat can change this image of Rahul
 LIVE: gujarat ke duusare charan kii voting kaverejdaak ke teen paataraahul nihsandeh nae avatar main nazar aa rahe hai
 The perception about them is changing rapidly
 rahul kaa aatmavishvaas behatar nazar aa rahaa he or unka bolnaa, chizon kaa jawaab dena, haazirajavaabi bhi sudhari nazar aa rahi he
 For the first time, Rahul appears like a mature leader
 unhen vipaksh bhi mriganauna maanane kii bhul nahin kar saktaa he
 But a defeat in Gujarat would open up the opportunity for him to re-attack the fiery attacks of ridicule
 rahul kii chhavi main sudhaar ko is vakt ek pratyaksh pramaan kii zarurat he or yah gujarat chunaav ke parinaamon se tay ho jayega
 It is also important for the new commander to win Gujarat because he is taken seriously in his own party, it is necessary for him to prove himself
 rahul puraa jor lagaakar bhi agar gujarat main congress kii naiya paar nahin laga pate hai to wo kis aadhaar par baaki rajyon main apane party ke chehron se jeet kii guarantee kaa vachan lenge
 In the coming days elections will be held in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh
 vahaan bhi party ke nae netaa ubhar rahe hai
 Rahul can ask for a guarantee of victory only if he shows it himself
 bhitarghaat kaa darcongress party main ek badi taadaad aise netaaon kii he jo rahul style raajnneeti main dhire-dhire haashie par dhakel die jaaenge or kam praasangik rah jaaenge
 In such a situation, if Rahul loses Gujarat then these leaders will give vent to discontent within the party
 gutbazi or sonia lao, congress bachaao jaise naare bhi die ja sakate hai
 Even the discouragement of the worker at the lower level in the party can be very heavy in terms of saving the organization and rebuilding it
 rahul ko is vakt apane kaaryakartaaon main utsaah bhi bharna he or rahul virdohi tatwon kaa munh bhi band karana he
 Therefore, it is also important to win them
 modi kaa vikalpgujarat chunaav ke thik baad kaa puraa ek saal yani 2018 agle aam chunaav ke liye desh main raajnneeti khadi karne kaa vakt he
 This time only Rahul's victory can bring him as an option for those dissatisfied with the opposition and Modi
 agar aisa nahin hua to vipaksh rahul main sambhaavnaaen dekhne se inkaar karegaa or banta vipaksh modi ke khilaaf ek vyapak ranneeti taiyaar karne se chook jayega
 In order to be an alternative to the politics of Modi and BJP in the next general election and to lead it, it is necessary that Rahul wins this election
 gujarat main unki jeet ek bada sandesh lekar jaaegi jiskaa asar aagaamee vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi dikhegaa or rashtriya raajnneeti par bhi
 In this way, Rahul's increased power will also give him the ability to operate any major platform of opposition
 bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke liye NDA main jari maan-manouvval ke bich aaj tak par sabase badi bahes shuru ho gai he

 i grew up with Ayurveda
 mere pita vaidya chandra prakaash apana dawaakhaana chalaate the or meri mata shashi mukhi ke sakriy sahyog se dhaatuon par aadhaarit ayurvedic davaaiyaan ghar par hi taiyaar karte the
 Food at home was varied and tailored to the weather: chapattis made of wheat, barley and gram after the summer festival Buddha Purnima; Buttermilk with jaggery in summer; No vegetable with leaves or roots in the rainy season; Maize and rice in autumn, and millet-jowar-rice, molasses molasses, dhritkumari (aloe vera) or sesame sweets, green leafy vegetables and nuts in the four months of winter
 ayurveda ke shaastra mere sabase pasandida mitra the
 i was fascinated at the sentiment light, which pointed to food for human health
 mujhe madh yaa alcohol ke bare main pataa chalaa ki agar use simit maatra main, samay par, aayu or mausam ke anuroop liya jaae, to vah laabhakaari ho saktaa he
 i bow to the ancient Gurus who compiled their knowledge
 lekin college pahunchane par maine paaya ki ayurveda main kisi kii bhi ruchi shaayad hi rahi ho
 The focus of students and teachers was entirely on Western medicines
 chunki maine apane pita ke dawaakhaane main asaadhya rogon kaa chamatkaari upachaar hote hue kai baar dekha tha, isliye vigyaan main grajuation karne ke baad main ayurveda kii ore badha
 My goal was to connect Ayurveda with mainstream medicine
 yah jarur kahana chaahunga ki yah ek mushkil or ekaaki safar tha
 Our ancient medical science Ayurveda emphasizes three basic principles - diet or diet, vihara or lifestyle and medicine or medicine
 aapako asangat yaa viruddh bhojan lene se bachanaa chahie
 Therefore, food may be against the country or contrary to the region
 agar aap shushk kshetra main rahete hai, to shushk yaa tikhaa bhojan na len, yaa agar daldali ilaake main rahete hai, to chiknayee vaala bhojan na len
 Do not go against time or season
 himalay kii talahatiyon ke seb agar garmiyon ke charam dinon main dakshin yaa madhya bharat main khaae jaaenge, to uskaa koi laabh nahin hoga
 In middle and old age, eating a diet rich in fat and protein would be against age
 bhojan kii maatra bhi mahatvapurn he
 25 percent of your food should be solid, 25 percent water and the rest air
 agar zyada calories vaala bhojan he, to yah prayek kaa ek-tihaai hona chahie
 Ayurveda states that food versus quantity can have adverse effects
 bemail yaa sanyog viruddh bhojan na karen
 Such as the combination of fish with radish, salt, curd and milk is likely to damage the body
 isi tarah swabhaav viruddh bhojan na len, jisase allergy paidaa ho sakati he
 For example, amla is widely used in food and medicines, but some people may be allergic to it
 ayurveda main us unmukt or laaparvaah bhojan ke prati aagaah kiya gaya he, jise ab aadhunik bharat ne apana liya he
 The habit of untimely eating, such as a very long interval between two meals, is called fasting, frequent eating is called adhyashana
 kisi ke bhi saath kuch bhi, kisi bhi samay, or bemail maatra main, deep-frid or baar-baar garm kiya gaya bhojan-jo sharir main amla or kshar kaa santulan bigaadta he or bimaariyaan paidaa karata he-mithyaa aahaar kehalaata he
 Culture and religious beliefs around the world influence the way food is used and are helpful in the development of a variety of diets
 sadiyon se chali aa rahi bhojan pranaaliyon se pare jane ke kaaran logon ke saamne jivan style sambandhi khatarnaak pareshaaniyaan paidaaho rahi hai
 Adopting traditional methods can be difficult, but forgetting your food heritage can be of no benefit
 hamen viraasat main bhojan kii jo bhartiya samskruti mili he, uskaa paalan karte hue apni jivan style or bhojan kii aadaton ko badalane kii jarurat he

 reddy ne kaha tha ki pakistan chahta he ki jammu kashmir main shanti baadhit ho or vah duniya ko kah sake ki kashmir ko lekar bharat sarkaar ke nirnay galat hai
 Reacting to the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and reports of violence there, he said that minor incidents are not happening for the first time

 The Supreme Court, hearing the 2G scam, asked on Thursday why action was not taken on the letter written by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to the then Telecom Minister a Raja
 is maamle main tippanee karte hue supreme court ne kaha ki yadi piem kii chitthee par karrwai hoti tab 2ji ghotaalaa nahin hota
 Neighboring countries are constantly jerking off to Pakistan
 pehle antarashtriya adaalat se use kulbhushan jadhav ke maamle main bada jhatka laga or ab baari america se aarthik jatke kii he
 Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan will meet President Donald Trump in the US a few days later
 lekin is mulaakaat se pehle hi pakistan ke liye acchhee khabar nahin he
 According to a report by the US Congress, unless Pakistan takes any concrete action against terrorist organizations, the financial assistance from the US will remain suspended
 janvari, 2018 main america raashtrapati donald trump ne pakistan ko milane vaali madad par roak laga di thi
 In such a situation, Pakistan was hopeful that the ban on financial aid could be lifted during the meeting with Imran khan
according to the report of American Congress Research Service (CRS), 'pakistan is still like a paradise for terrorist organizations, the Pakistani government constantly Has been supporting them
 isi kii vajah se pakistan kaa padosiyon ke saath jhagada bhi rahata he
 'let me tell you that CRS is a research wing of the US Congress, which continuously prepares the report keeping in view the issues of the world
 haalanki, ye sirf ek export ke dwaara taiyaar kii gai report hoti he ise congress kaa rukh nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 In its report, the expert has also mentioned al-qaeda chief Osama bin Laden
 report main kaha gaya ki osama lambey samay tak pakistan main samay gujaarta rahaa lekin vahaan kii sarkaar chup rahi
 This has been the reason why the Trump government has been consistently taking a tough stand on Pakistan and at times the US has been cutting financial aid
 ek taraf pakistan par america ke dwaara milane vaali aarthik madad milane kaa khatra he to duusari taraf financial ection task force (FATF) bhi pakistan par sakht he
 The FATF says that if Pakistan does not take action against the terrorists, it will be put on the black list
 immergency ke dauraan jail main kaid rahe misa bandiyon kii pension khatre main hai
 The Congress has turned its eyes on the Misabandi pension as soon as the government changes in Madhya Pradesh
 congress kaa kahana he ki yah sarkari paise kii phijulkharchi he
 At the same time, BJP says that there will be strong opposition from the house to the road
 madhyapradesh main philhal 2000 se zyada misabandi 25 hajaar rupee masik pension le rahe hai
 In 2008, the Shivraj government made a provision to provide 3000 and 6000 pensions to MISA prisoners
 baad main pension raashi badhaakar 1 xxrep 4 0 rupee kii gai
 In the year 2017, the pension amount of MISA prisoners was increased to Rs 25000
 is par salanaa kareeb 75 karod kaa kharch aata he
 The Congress alleges that the BJP government has spent crores of rupees to distribute revolu to its people
 congress kii media prabharee shobhaa ojha ne kaha bijepi sarkaar ne 25000 rupee prati maah misabandi ke logon ko baanta he
 Freedom fighters were not getting pension but Misa gave pension to the prisoners
 sarkaar 75 karod rupee salanaa lutaa rahi thi, isko turant band hona chahie
 Senior BJP leader Kailash Joshi had been underground for a month during the Emergency and was subsequently arrested at the assembly door
 19 maheene nazarband rahe rajya main unke kai saathiyon ko misabandi pension milti he
 These include people like former Chief Minister Babulal Gaur, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, former Union Minister Sartaj Singh
 kailash joshi kaa maananaa he ki immergency ke dauraan hui takalifon ke maddenjar pension ko barkaraar rakhana chahie, use waapas nahin lenaa chahie
 The reasons that were given were justified
 party uskaa virodh karegi
 Those who were at the time of Misebandi had raised a lot of difficulty
 use waapas karne yah nirnay liya tha
 However, it will not be easy for the Congress government to reach the figure of 121 with the support of other parties and independents, because the Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan Samman Nidhi Rule, made in 2008, was passed by the BJP by enacting an Act in the Assembly in 2018
 police par bhi bacchee par hue is hamale par turant kaarywahi nahin karne kaa aarope lagaaya ja rahaa he
 In another part of Motihari, a 17-year-old girl was allegedly physically abused at gunpoint

 aatankwaadi osama bin laden ke bete hamaja bin laden ke maare jane kii khabar he
 Osama bin Laden was the kingpin of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda and Hamza was considered the successor of Osama
 haalanki, america media reports ke mutabik abhi hamaja kii maut kii pushti nahin hui he
 It is also not clear where and how Hamza died? Whether or not America has a hand in Hamza's death is not clear
 haalanki, america ke khufia adhikariyon ne hamaja kii maut kaa daawa kiya he
 In 2015, Laden's son Hamza bin Laden threatened the US that he would attack America to avenge his father's death
 jiske baad america ne us par 10 lakh dollar (kareeb 7 karod rupee) kaa puraskaar rakhaa tha
 Osama bin Laden was killed by American SEAL commandos in Abbottabad, Pakistan on 2 May 2011, swearing to avenge the father's killers
 bataaya jaataa he ki apane pita kii maut ke baad hamaja apni maa yani osama kii teen jivit patniyon main se ek kheriya sabaar ke saath abtabad main hi rah rahaa tha
 In 2015, Al Qaeda Chief Ayman Al Zawahiri introduced Hamza to the world
 hamaja ne us vakt america se apane pita kii hatya kaa badla lene kii dhamkee di or tabaahi machaane kii kasam khai thi
 In the year 2017, Hamza was declared a global terrorist by the US Interior Ministry
 saath hi america ne hamaja ke sir par 10 lakh dollar kaa puraskaar rakhaa tha
 However, no statement of Hamza has surfaced since 2018
 UNSC ne bhi lagaaya tha ballmerica bain ke baad sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad (UNSC) ne bhi march 2019 main hamaja ke naam ko pratibandhit aatankiyon kii suchi main daal diya tha or uski giraftaar ke liye nayaa interpol notice jari kiya tha
 With this ban, the travel of Hamza bin Laden was banned
 uski sari sampattiyaan jabt kar lee gai thim
 Also, the purchase and sale of weapons on his behalf was banned
 bataa den ki us samay hamaja bin laden ko alqaida sargana ayman al jawahiri ke 'sabase sambhavit uttaradhikari' ke rup main dekha ja rahaa tha
 Married to the daughter of the terrorist, it was also reported that Laden's son Hamza had married the daughter of Mohammed Atta, the perpetrator of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center (WTC)

 The death of our fame will be anonymous, there will be no experience, no story will be there
 jiya khan kii khudakushi kii khabar ne glamer kii rangeen duniya ko ek baar jhakzor kar rakh diya he
 Once again the question has started to be asked whether the result of the life of sizzling comes in the form of loneliness and loneliness and whether failure and anonymity often become the cause of death
 shoharat kii aisi maut se bollywood ek baar nahin balki kai baar do-chaar ho chukaa he
 From 2007 to 2010, three big films, 'nishabd', 'ghajini' and 'housefull', all three hits
 teenon main bollywood ke sabase bade hero par iske baad bhi jiya rupahale parde kii dhadkan nahin ban pai
 Despite being a part of three hit films, Jia did not get any work for the next three years
 parde se utarate hi jiya bollywood ke diarector producers ke jehan se bhi utar gai or aisi utari ki bollywood to bollywood south waalon ne bhi use kaam dene se manaa kar diya or bas yaheen par jiya kii choti si kahani khatm ho jaati he
 The glare of this shining world has pushed more people into blind wells of oblivion and ruin than they have achieved to fame
 kya karen, khwaabon kii is duniya kaa dastur hi aisa he
 Here, the successful people sit on their eyes and throw the unsuccessful people in their midst and throw them away so that they neither live in this world of dreams nor in our world
 chakachaundh bhari glamer kii duniya ke bich bhi akelepan kaa andhera nigal gaya jiya khan ko
 The 25-year-old Zia, who was afraid of falling to the ground due to the height of fame and in fear of failure and oblivion, gave up her own beats
 rupahale parde par chamakane kii hasarat paale landan se mumbai ai jiya khan kii juhu ke isi sagar tarang apartment ke flats number 102 main somvaar der raat pankhe se jhulati laash mili thi
 Why did Jia throw the bouquet out of the window a few hours before her death? Why was Jia fighting her boyfriend for the last 29 minutes? Why did Jia suspect that her lover loves another girl? Death has happened suddenly, everyone is stunned by the news of death, all in all
 marane se pehle jiya ne koi suicide note bhi nahin choda
 Apparently, in such a situation, the police are going to explore every doubt and question before closing the case directly and Suraj Pancholi, son of actor Aditya Pancholi is at the forefront of this doubt and question
 yani jiya khan kaa vahi premi jisase jiya ne marane se pehle aakhri baar baat kii thi or aakhri baar ladi thi
 Jia was upset with a drowning film career, desperate
 to kya bas isi naakaami ne use maut ke munh dhakel diya? yaa phir iske peeche vajah kuch or he? jiya kii postmortem report ke mutabik marane se pehle usne kaaphi maatra main sharba pi thi or aakhri vakt tak phone par premi se uski ladaai bhi hui thi
 So did failure in movies as well as love become the reason for Jia's death? Date: 03 May 2013 Place: Flat No
 102, Sagar Sangeet Apartment, Mumbai Time: Around 11 pm
 00 bajebollywood kii dilkash adaakara jiya khan ke flats ke baahar achaanak ek awaz si aati he
 The sound is of something falling
 isi bich padosiyon kii nazar ek guladaste par padati he, jo shaayad jiya ke flats se hi baahar phenki gai thi
 Since the matter was simple, no one would pay much attention to it
 jiya flats main apni maa or bahan ke saath rahati thi
 Both went to a party on Monday night
 vahaan se lautne ke baad wo awaad detii hai lekin jiya darwaja nahin kholti
 Later, after entering the house, they both scream
 yahaan jiya pankhe se lataki hui he
 The police are informed immediately and everything that happens after this is known to everyone
 zaahir he, pehali nazar main maamla khudakushi kaa hi lagata he or jis tarah se jiya kii maa ne uske depressant main hone kii baat kahi he, usase ye baat or pukhta ho jaati he lekin sabase bada sawaal bihi he ki kya is depressant ke peeche jiya kaa duubataa filmi kariyar hi he yaa phir pyaar
 According to the post-mortem report, Jiya had consumed a lot of syrup before she died and had a fight with her boyfriend Suraj Pancholi over her phone
 khudakushi se takreeban ghante bhar pehle tak jiya apane premi or abhinayta aditya pancholi ke bete suraj pancholi se mobile par baat kar rahi thi
 The call details revealed that Jia and Suraj 10 nights
 53 se 11
 They kept talking on the phone till 22
 iske kareeb aadhe ghante baad jiya kii maa or bahan ghar lauti to wo pankhe par jul rahi thi
 That is, before death, Jia spoke to Suraj for the last time
 itnaa hi nahin jiya ke mobile ke esemes baks kii jaanch se ye bhi pataa chalaa he ki somvaar raat donon ne ek-duusare ko kai esemes bhi kiye the
 Jiya sms Suraj Pancholi and asked about another girl in her life
 jis par suraj ne jawaab diya tha ki aisi duusari koi ladki uski jindagi main nahin he or wo use galat samaj rahi he
 Now, since the last conversation and SMS was before Suraj Pancholi before the death, the police questioned Suraj
 juhu police stesan main poochtacha kate liye bulaae jane par suraj aditya pancholi or apni maa ke saath aayaa tha
 Though Suraj was released after several hours of questioning by the police, according to police sources, Suraj has not received the clean chit
 jaahir he suraj se poochtacha kar police jiya kii zindagi ke aakiri lamhon ke isi sach ko jaananaa chaahati he, lekin ek sach ye bhi he ki jiya apane kariyar ko lekar pichley teen saalon se pareshaan chal rahi thi or khud uske ghar ke log is baat kii tasdik kar rahe hai
 According to the family members, Jiya had gone to Hyderabad last week to audition for the Telugu film, but the matter did not materialize
 kehete hai ki diarector ne is role ke liye jiya ko apana vajan badhaane kii salaah di thi par jiya iske liye raji nahin hui
 Although the police believe that if Jiah was in depression due to audition, she would have committed suicide as soon as she returned to Mumbai, would not have waited so many days
 police ko shaq he ki maamla sirf kariyar kaa nahin balki duubate pyaar kaa bhi ho saktaa he
 By the way, Aditya Pancholi says that there was a very good relationship between the two families
 suraj or jiya ke afaire kii baat bhi wo maan rahe hai par aditya pancholi kaa kahana he ki kareeb do maheene pehle donon kaa brallep ho gaya tha

 After a bitter defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, a round of review is on in the opposition parties
 aise main loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ke ashwamedh kaa rath rokane or apane siyaasi vajood ko dobaaraa paane se liye basapa adhyaksh mayawati ne sapa se sari dushmani bhulaakar haath milaayaa
 Despite this, the SP-BSP alliance collapsed in the fierce wave of Narendra Modi
 is karaari haar se sapa ke baad ab basapa bhi haar kii samiksha ke liye 3 june yani somvaar ko baithak karne ja rahi he
 BSP President Mayawati has called a meeting in Delhi on 3 June
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad basapa kii yah pehali samiksha baithak he, jisamen mayawati ne apane sabhi navnirvaachit saansadon, loksabhaa pratyaashiyon, jonal incharge or jiladhyakshon ko baithak main bulaayaa he
 It is believed that in this meeting, the BSP supremo will churn on why the Lok Sabha elections did not yield the expected results
 bataa den ki uttar pradesh kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se bijepi gathbandhan ne 64 seat jiti hai
 BJP 62 and its ally Apna Dal managed to win 2 seats
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan mahaj 15 seat hi jeet paaya
 In this, BSP has got 10 seats and SP has got 5 seats
 jabaki, mayawati-akhilesh donon netaaon ne 50 se zyada seat jeetne kaa mansuba paal rakhaa tha
 But the election results have come contrary to his thinking
 aise main donon dalon ko bada jhatka laga he
 But in the 2019 elections, the number of BSP mps has reached minus 10
 basapa supremeo mayawati ne apane jite hue sabhi 10 saansadon ke saath ravivaar ko baithak kar unke saath aage kii ranneeti par vichaar-vimarsh kiya tha
 BSP contested 38 seats in the Lok Sabha elections in the state
 jabaki sapa ne 37 siton par kismat aajamaai thi
 In fact, the bsp's graph was continuously falling from the 2012 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 haalat yah ho gai thi ki 2014 ke loksabhaa main basapa khaataa bhi nahin khol saki thi
 After this, in the 2017 assembly elections, the BSP could win only 19 seats
 is tarah 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav basapa ke liye nai ummid lekar aayaa tha, lekin cycle or hathi kaa gathbandhan phussa ho gaya
 The assets of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi crossed the value of one crore rupees in 2012, compared to 40 lakhs five years ago
 vidhansabha chunaav ke liye namakan ke dauraan modi dwaara die gaye halafname main yah baat saamne ai he
 The comments unhone shanivaar ko maninagar nirvachan kshetra ke liye namakan patr bharaa
 In 2007, the Chief Minister had assets worth Rs 40 lakh
 us samay unki sampatti main gandhinagar sector-1 main ek bhukhand shaamil tha, jisaki keemat 30 lakh thi
 This plot was purchased for Rs 1,30,488
 halafname ke anusaar us bhukhand kaa bazaar mulya ab ek karod ho gaya he
 a development work of Rs 2,47,208 has been done on this
 modi kii anya sampattiyon main bank jamaa, sone kii anguuthiyaan, enessi aadi hai, jinaki keemat 33,42,842 rupee hai
 He filled the nomination papers for Maninagar constituency on Saturday
 varsh 2007 main mukhyamantri ke paas 40 lakh rupee mulya kii sampatti thi
 At that time, his property included a plot in Gandhinagar Sector-1, which was worth 30 lakhs

 In both the seats the BJP had to face defeat
 isse pehle gorakhpur or phulpur main bhi party ko maat khaani padi thi
 The bjp's successive defeats in the by-elections are a big setback for the Yogi government of UP and especially Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 jis upi main 2014 ke loksabhaa or ek saal pehle 2017 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main banpar siten mili thi, ab usee rajya main bijepi manjhdhaar main fansi hui najar aa rahi he
 Let us tell you that the strong vote that was received by the BJP in 2014 Lok Sabha Elections and last year 2017 UP Assembly BJP has started to break into it
 jabaki 2017 ke chunaav main bijepi ne upi main 14 saal ke satta ke vanvaas ko khatm kiya tha or 325 siton ke saath aitihaasik jeet darj kii thi

 This charisma for BJP was due to the face of PM Narendra Modi, the final result of the by-elections in 4 Lok Sabha, 10 assembly seats
 vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi kii ore se kisi ko siem pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit nahin kiya gaya tha, lekin nattejey aane ke baad piem modi or party adhyaksh amit shah ne satta kii kaman yogi adityanath ko saunpi
 Yogi Adityanath has not been able to follow along with the caste balance that JP came to power
 bijepi kii jeet main sabase ahm bhoomika obisi or dalit samudaay kii thi
 But they were not given proper participation in governance and power
 iske alaava yogi raaj main rajput or daliton ke bich saharanpur jaisi hinsak ghatnaayen bhi saamne ain
 Apart from this, the CM was also accused of promoting a particular caste
 yahi vajah he ki yogi sarkaar ke kai mantriyon ne is par sawaal bhi khadey kiye hai
 While the Opposition took advantage of this, they tried to help the obcs and the Dalit community, in which they seem to be successful
 vikaas kaa ingine felmodi upi ke varanasi se saansad hai
 In such a situation, Awam hoped that the way Gujarat has shown development, UP will also develop on the same lines
 upi ke piem modi ne vikaas kaa ingine banane kaa elaan kiya tha
 He said that before 2019, the state will be established as an engine of development in the country
 pradesh main bijepi sarkaar bane ek saal se zyada vakt guzar chukaa he, lekin sarkaar ke paas vikaas ke naam par ginane ke liye kuch khaas nahin hai
 SP chief Akhilesh Yadav says, 'UP will not develop from a yogi, he can only do good pooja recitation
 'lakhanu-gorakhpur kaa safaryogi adityanath siem ke saath-saath gorakhnath math ke mahant bhi hai
 He has been a five-time MP from Gorakhpur Lok Sabha
 yahi vajah he ki ve apane aapako gorakhpur se baahar nahin nikaal paa rahe hai
 He is only visiting Gorakhpur for two to three visits a month
 iske chalate vipaksh lagaataar sawaal uthaa rahaa he, ki ve har saptaah to gorakhnath mandir main puja karne ja rahe hai
 Yogi Adityanath, behind the Hindutva agenda, was for many years himself a staunch Hinduist politics face
 siem banane ke baad yogi ne nayaa avatar liya, to unka naaraa tha, 'kisi se bhedbhaav nahin or kisi kii manuhaar nahin
 'but now he seems to be contrasted with his image, which is not being liked by the staunch supporters of BJP
 yogi tajmahal ke baahar jhaadu laga rahe hai, masjid main jane kii baat karte hai or madrason ko modern banane main lage hai
 Hindutva agenda is being left behind by the changed image of Yogi
 ramamandir par khamoshyodhya main ramamandir bijepi kaa mul mudda tha
 Even after BJP governments at the Center and the state, the party is silent on the Ram temple issue
 jabaki vipaksh main rahete hue yogi adityanath ramamandir maamle ko jamkar uthaate rahe hai
 Now when they are in power, it is being said to resolve the matter either through mutual negotiations or through court
 kairana nahin bana prayogshalakairana loksabhaa seat par rashtriya lokdal va nurpur vidhansabha seat par sapa kii jeet se vipakshi dalon ke gathbandhan kii neenv majboot hui he
 The BJP failed to polarize these seats despite all efforts
 kairana jaise saamaajik sameekaran west upi ke kai jilon main hai
 This is the same area where votes were polarized on communal grounds in 2014 Lok Sabha and 2017 assembly elections in favor of BJP after the 2013 riots
 natijatan, pashchimi upi main bhaajapa ko ekatarfa jeet hasil hui thi
 Chaudhary Ajit Singh also lost his parliamentary seat in Baghpat, adjacent to Kairana
 pichley do chunaavon main jat or musalamaanon ke bich khai bani hui thi
 In Kairana, stopping the polarization of votes by mustering Muslim candidates was nothing short of an examination for RLD
 ralod isamen paas ho gaya
 He stopped Kairana from becoming a laboratory of polarization
 yogi sarkaar ke ek saal se zyada samay guzar chukaa he, lekin bijepi ko phayda hone kii bajaay lagaataar nuksaan uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 The Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister have lost their parliamentary seats
 iske baad ab kairana or nurpur main bhi bijepi post najar ai
 That too at a time when Lok Sabha elections are near, it is a danger bell for BJP

 a general manager of the company Avnish Kumar Dev was killed in the violence, while 96 other employees were injured

 Based on this, the company management has now decided to take these employees out

 It is being told that the fired employees signed a bond after the violence and sabotage last year and said that they would not be involved in such incidents in future
 isi aadhaar par ab company prabandhan ne in karmchaariyon ko baahar nikaalane kaa faisla kiya he
