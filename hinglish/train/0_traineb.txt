 He was seen on CCTV in Karimnagar in Telangana after a bank robbery
 karimnagar kii dakaiti farvari 2014 main hui thi
 Three months later, in May 2014, a bangalore-guwahati train explosion takes place
 do maheene baad 10 july 2014 ko pune ke farskhanaa main hue bam dhamaake main inhen aaropee banaaya jaataa he
 Some of these names also came up in a bomb blast in Chennai and Haryana
 farvari 2016 main telugana kii police ne inhen urisa ke rourkela se pakadaa
 These four people were there from the house where they were caught and they were accompanied by an old woman
 zaahir he inkaa record aisa tha ki inhen bhopal kii central jail kii saamaanya barrack main nahin rakhaa gaya hoga
 IG Bhopal says that all these were kept in different barracks which are in different sectors
 do sector main teen-teen the or ek main do the
 If the police is right that these terrorists locked in the cell of three different barracks came out at the same time by breaking the door or opening it with the key
 alag-alag cell ke darvaaze todate vakt kisi ne nahin dekha
 Did Ramashankar Yadav have the key? alag-alag jelon main tainaat adhikariyon ne naam na bataaye jane kii shart par bataaya ki chaabi prahari ke paas nahin honi chahie
 The jailor has
 teen-teen baiyrakon ke cell se baahar aana, phir barrack se aana aasaan nahin he
 The cell also has a door and the barrack also has a door
 cell or barrack ke block ke bich kaidiyon ko do darvaaze todane pade honge
 Even then, security personnel inside the jail were not informed
 ramashankar yadav kahaan tainaat the or unki muthbhed in aparaadhiyon se kahaan hoti he
 This is the subject of investigation
 agar ye barrack se nikal bhi bhaage to 16 se 21 feet oonchi diwaar kya sirf chaadaron or kambalon ke sahare faandi ja sakati he
 When they were tearing down the walls with their support, what were the armed security guards deployed on the watch tower at the corner of the outer wall of the jail
 ek sawaal yah bhi he ki central jail kii diwaar par bijli kii taar hoti he
 Was the electric wire not working at that time or did they cut the wire
 madhya pradesh sarkaar ne jail adheekshak, diaiji jail, ediji jail ko suspend kar diya he
 The former police chief will investigate the matter
 enie bhi jaanch karegi
 All these absconding prisoners also have questions about the news of being killed
 ab do tarah ke video aae hai
 Police are saying that their veracity is yet to be investigated
 ek video main ek goli chalaane ke baad ek pulicekarmi inkaar kar detaa he kyonki video recording ho rahi he
 There is another video whose audio suspects the theory of the encounter
 is video kii bhi satyata pramanit honi he
 Why was the bullet shot when five wanted to surrender with shaking hands? is video se nahin lagata ki paanch log police par hamalaa karnaa chaahate hai
 Questions were still arising that these two videos made the case even more suspicious
 bhaage hue apradhi aatanki maamle main aaropee zarur hai lekin unke bhaagane kaa tarika or encounter ke ye video kai sawaal jod dete hai
 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh's statement is just after the encounter
 tab tak video saamne nahin aayaa tha
 The question arose when the state Home Minister while talking to NDTV said that the absconding prisoners had no weapons
 unke paas chaaku or plate the, jinaki madad se ve hatya karne or bhaagane main safal rahe
 The comments yah kaha ja rahaa he ki ghatana us vakt hui jab duty kii adla badali ho rahi thi
 Then there should be extra vigilance in the jail
 ek pal ke liye maan bhi len to kya sab itane beparwaah the, duty badalane ke vakt ki aath kaidi bhaag nikle
 Do barracks or cell locks are also opened during the exchange of duty
 jammu kashmir ke udi main bhi yahi baat ai thi ki unit kii adlabadali ke bich aatankwaadiyon ne faaydaa uthaakar hamalaa kar diya
 We need to be especially vigilant at the time of exchange of duties and units from the border to the jail
 baharhaal jail se bhaagane ke baad inke paas hathiyaar kahaan se aa gaye
 Because the police say that they opened fire on the police
 ai ji yogesh choudhary kaa kahana he ki simi activist ke paas se chaar desi bandook or teen tej dhar vaale hathiyaar baraamad hue hai
 But in one video it is heard that three are running away and five are standing and pointing to talk
 sawaal ye bhi hai ki agar police kaa daawa sahi he to inke paas bhaagane ke chand ghante ke bheetar itane hathiyaar wo bhi bandook kaise aa gai
 If a gang helped them, where were they
 kya ve hathiyaar dekar laapata ho gaye
 It should also be the subject of investigation
 congress ke digvijay singh ne is ghatana par sawaal kiya he
 Jyotiraditya Scindia of Congress has given praise to the state police on this incident
 ye sabhi qaidi pratibandhit sanghathan simi ke sadsy the
 There were cases against them in different courts of different states on charges ranging from bank robbery to bomb blasts
 aatank ke maamle main jinaki talash centre or rajya kii tamaam suraksha agenciyaan kar rahi thim
 Of the eight prisoners who escaped in this case, three of them escaped from Khandwa jail in Madhya Pradesh in October 2013
 hyderabad se hamaari sahyogi uma sudhir ne bataaya ki khandava se bhaage saat kaidiyon main se ek ne sarender kar diya or ek giraftaar kar liya gaya tha
 The remaining five accused were missing for a long time and during this time were involved in horrific criminal and terrorist activities
 april 2015 main telugana police ne in paanch faraar aparaadhiyon main se do ko maar giraaya
 Then the two people who were killed by the Telangana police described the leader of the group
 telugana ke karimnagar kii ek bank dakaiti ke baad vahaan kii sisitivi main ye dikh gaye
 The robbery of Karimnagar took place in February 2014
 uske teen maheene baad may 2014 main bengalooru-guwahati train main dhamaakaa hota he
 Two months later, on 10 July 2014, he is accused in the bomb blast in Farsakhana, Pune
 chennai or haryana main bhi hue ek bam dhamaake main inamen se kuch kaa naam aayaa tha
 In February 2016, Telangana police caught them from Rourkela in Odisha
 jis ghar se pakadaa vahaan ye chaar log the or inke saath ek budhi mahila bhi thi
 It is evident that his record was such that he would not have been kept in the common barrack of the Central Jail in Bhopal
 aiji bhopal kaa kahana he ki in sabhi ko alag-alag baiyrakon main rakhaa gaya tha jo alag-alag sector main hai
 There were three in two sectors and two in one
 agar police kii ye baat sahi he ki teen alag-alag baiyrakon ke cell main band ye aatankwaadi ek saath ek samay par darvaaze tod kar baahar aae yaa chaabi se khol kar
 No one noticed while breaking the doors of different cells
 kya ramashankar yadav ke paas chaabi thi
 The officers posted in different jails, on the condition of anonymity, told that the key should not be with the guard
 jailer ke paas hoti he
 It is not easy to come out of the cell of three barracks, then come from the barracks
 cell main bhi daravaaza hota he or barrack main bhi daravaaza hota he
 Inmates must break two doors between the cell and the barrack blocks
 tab bhi jail ke bheetar tainaat surakshakarmiyon ko khabar nahin hui
 Where was Ramashankar Yadav stationed and where do he encounter these criminals
 ye jaanch kaa vishay he
 Even if they run out of the barrack, can a 16 to 21 feet high wall be set only with the help of sheets and blankets
 jab ye inke sahare diwaar phaand rahe the tab jail kii bahari diwaar ke kone par bane watch tower par tainaat hathiyaarband surakshakarmi kya kar rahe the
 There is also a question that there is a power cord on the wall of the Central Jail
 kya us vakt bijli kii taar kaam nahin kar rahi thi yaa inhone taar kaat di
 Madhya Pradesh government has suspended Jail Superintendent, DIG Jail, ADG Jail
 purv police pramukh is maamle kii jaanch karenge
 The NIA will also investigate
 ye sabhi faraar qaidi ke maar diye jane kii khabar ko lekar bhi sawaal hone lagate hai
 Now two types of videos have arrived
 police kah rahi he ki inaki satyata kii abhi jaanch honi he
 a policeman refuses after shooting a video in a video as the video recording is taking place
 ek or video aayaa he jiskaa audio encounter kii theory ko sandigdh karata he
 The truth of this video also has to be proved
 jab paanch haath hilaakar sarender karnaa chaahate the to goli kyon maari gai
 The video does not show that five people want to attack the police
 sawaal abhi uth hi rahe the ki in do video ne maamle ko or bhi sandigdh bana diya he
 The runaway criminals are definitely the accused in the terror case, but their escape and the video of the encounter add many questions
 mukhyamantri shivaraj singh kaa bayaan encounter ke thik baad kaa he
 The video was not revealed until then
 sawaal tab uthaa jab rajya ke grahamantri ne enditivi se baat karte hue kaha ki faraar qaidiyon ke paas koi hathiyaar nahin tha
 They had knives and plates, with which they managed to kill and escape
 tippaniyan It is being said that the incident happened when the duty was being swapped
 tab to jail main atirikt satarkta honi chahie
 Even for a moment, if everyone was so careless, at the time of changing duty that eight prisoners escaped
 duty kii adla badali ke vakt kya baiyrakon yaa cell ke taale bhi khole jate hai
 The same thing happened in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir that the terrorists took advantage of the attack amidst the exchange of units
 zarurat he ki ham seemaa se lekar jail ke bheetar tak duty or unit kii adla badali ke samay vishesh rup se satark rahen
 However, after escaping from jail, where did the weapons come from
 kyonki police kaa kahana he ki inhone police par goli chalaai
 IG Yogesh Chaudhary says four indigenous guns and three sharp-edged weapons have been recovered from the SIMI activist
 lekin ek video main sunai detaa he ki teen bhaag rahe hai or paanch khadey hokar baat karne kaa ishaara kar rahe hai
 The question is also that if the police claim is true, then how did the gun come with such a weapon within a few hours of their escape
 agar kisi giroh ne inaki madad kii he to wo kahaan the
 Did they go missing with weapons? yah bhi jaanch kaa vishay hona chahie
 Digvijay Singh of Congress has questioned the incident
 congress ke jyotiraditya sindhiya ne is ghatana par rajya police ko shaabaashi di he
 Our colleague Uma Sudhir from Hyderabad said that one of the seven prisoners who had fled from Khandwa surrendered and one was arrested
 baaki paanch aaropee lambey samay tak gaayab rahe or is dauraan bhayankar kism kii aapraadhik or aatanki gatividhiyon main shaamil rahe
 In April 2015, the Telangana police killed two of these five absconding criminals
 tab telugana police ne maare gaye do logon ko group kaa leader bataaya tha
 He was seen on CCTV in Karimnagar in Telangana after a bank robbery
 karimnagar kii dakaiti farvari 2014 main hui thi

 Ketan Mehta must have felt that even though Nawazuddin is a good actor in the eyes of people today, he is not a star
 aaj bhi log shahrukh ke romance, salmaan kii body or akshay ke ection se upar nahin uth paae hai or phir bina item song ke darshakon se film dekhne kii ummid karnaa hi beja he
 However, not only Toketan Mehta, another veteran director of Bollywood completed his ambitious project this year, yes Anurag Kashyap
 'bombai belwet' ke saath bhi anuraag ne yahi galati kii thi jo kethan mehta ne 'maanjhi-da mountain main' ke saath kii
 The mistake was an attempt to mix art and commercial cinema
 ab in donon ke baad 'queen' se raja bane vikaas bahal bhi badi shandaar film laa rahe hai trailor to shandaar he lekin film kitni shandaar hogi yah dekhnaa mjedaar hoga
 Well let us return to Ketan Mehta's 'manjhi - The Mountain Man' and know what the shortcomings in the film were that if worked on would surely fetch the 'manjhi - The Mountain Man' awards as well as the world level

 In light of the inclusion of different issues in the film, he lightened the original story of the story
 film ek vishay par kendrit nahin dikhti he jisaki vajah se film main khalipan shuru se aakhir tak bana rahata he
 To show the story of the film in an interesting way, he also did a sequence of scenes back and forth but that sequence does not seem justified but rather prick
 film main kuch seens gairajaruri bhi lagate hai jo mul kahani kaa vajan halkaa karte hai
 Overall, the direction of the film is weak compared to Ketan Mehta's ability

 In the film, Pankaj Tripathi has acted in his familiar style, while Gaurav Dwivedi has played the character of journalist well, the best thing about Gaurav's character is that his character seems to be maturing over time

 The plot of the story has become confusing as the screenplay rotates around the screen

 Whether it is the scene of Manjhi's neighbor's wife's murder or Manjhi coming to Delhi on foot

 Skinplay struggles with impunity and is unable to tell the story of Manjhi's obsessive love
 film dekhte vakt kai baar mahasoos hota he ki film bollywood style main banaai gai ek documentry he

 Shankarbhai Vegad pradhanmantri narendra modi par rahul gandhi ke hamale ke kuch hi der baad bhartiya janata party ne palatwaar karte hue kaha ki congress upaadhyaksh ab bhi ‘diaper baby’ hai
 Rahul had proved that on the PM, Nisarahul said that Vasundhara Raje government's 'remote' is with Lalit Modi in London
 is par bijepi ne jawaab diya ki congress to remote control se hi sarkaar chalaati thi or usee ko adarsh maanati thi, lekin bijepi main aisa nahin he
 While Rahul targeted the central and Rajasthan governments on many issues including the land bill and the Lalit Modi controversy, BJP Secretary Siddharth Nath Singh also immediately hit back at Rahul by holding a press conference
 rahul ko dilaai lalit modi ke twit kii yadasiddharth ne congress ke netritv vaali upie sarkaar ke shashan main hue kai kathith ghotaalon tathaa rahul ke jijarobert wadrake vivaadaaspad bhoomi saudon ko rahul par nishane kaa hathiyaar banaate hue kaha ki rahul ne jo ‘diaper’ pahan rakhaa he, unhen usase baahar nikalnaa hoga
 Rahul's comments and behavior remind us that he is still a diaper-wearing 'baby'
 lalit modi ke ek twit kaa zikr karte hue unhone rahul kii mausi jariye 500-600 karod rupee ke sambhavit saude ko lekar kaha ki rahul ko is bare main bolnaa chahie
 Siddhartha said 'rahul Chhota Bachcha' that Rahul Gandhi spoke on land, remote control and 56 inches
 ‘jaisaa maine kaha he ki rahul ek ‘chota baccha’ he or koi chote bachche ko salaah de, acchhee baat nahin he
 But the Congress is giving them a big responsibility, so we want to give a good advice to Rahul
 aapako hamaari aalochana kaa adhikaar he lekin tathyon ke aadhaar par hamaari aalochana karen
 'siddharth did not stop here, he advised Rahul to play a more creative role
 unhone majaak banaate hue kaha, ‘aapane (rahul ne) das saal barbaad kiye

 ’input: bhashaa Of course, Team India is extremely upset these days by Corey Anderson's performance, but the IPL franchises are happy
 ji haa! jis tarah kaa pradarshan haalia dinon main anderson ne kiya he, usase sabhi ipel timen unpar boli lagane ke liye betaab hai
 Anderson, who broke the record of the fastest ODI century of Shahid Afridi after 17 years, has consistently given a message against India that he is a big player and will take the price too big
 saal 2014 kii shuruyaat anderson ke liye behad dhamaakedaar hui
 He broke Shahid Afridi's record for the fastest century in 37 balls on January 1
 kori anderson ne westeindies ke khilaaf 36 gendon main hi shatak jadkar cricket jagat main halchal machaa di
 Many believed that the fastest century scored by Corey Anderson could be just a ruckus, but now that the way Anderson has troubled Team India, the doubt about his ability is removed
 pichley saal kii nilaamee main jab australia ke glen maxwell ko ek million dollar dekar mumbai indiens ne kharida, to sabaki bhuein tan gayi
 But the kind of feats Corey Anderson has performed so far is clear that he can be the 'million Dollar Baby' this time, and perhaps no one is surprised this time
 sabhi frenchiji kii koshish hogi ki ve is khilaadi ko apni team main shaamil karen
 Not only does Anderson bat stormy, but he is also capable of great bowling
 chennai super kings, royal chalangers bangalore or mumbai indiens khaas taur par kori anderson ko kharidne kii daud main sabase aage maane ja rahe hai, kyonki in teenon hi tiimon ke coach newjiland se aate hai
 While Chennai coach Stephen Fleming is coaching Daniel Vettori of Bangalore, Mumbai Indians coach John Wright is responsible for the coaching of Mumbai Indians
 par kehete hai, baap bada naa bhaiya sabase bada rupaiya, to aise main jo team zyada badi boli lagaaegi wo anderson ko le jaaegi
 The auction dates are 12 and 13 February

 Several organizations including the Animal Welfare Board have filed an application in the Supreme Court on the Jallikattu case
 arji main jallikattu ko lekar tamilnadu sarkaar ke nae act ko chunauti di he
 The petition said that this act is unconstitutional
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki 2014 main supreme court ne aadesh diya tha ki jallikattu main jaanwaron par atyaachaar hota he or rajya main jallikattu ko ijaajat nahin di ja sakati
 In such a situation, the Tamil Nadu state cannot amend a central law such as the Prevention of Cruelty against Animals
 iske alaava supreme court is maamle main punarvichaar yachika khaarij kar chukaa he
 This new act of the state is defeating the order of the Supreme Court
 yachika main nae act par roak lagane kii bhi maang he
 The comments supreme court is maamle par somvaar ko sunwaayee kar saktaa he
 The petitioners told Justice Deepak Mishra that the Central Government wanted to withdraw its notifications, but the Center should not be allowed to withdraw the notifications before the hearing
 justise mishra ne kaha ki ham chaahate hai ki is maamle kii sunwaayee somvaar ko karen, lekin bench ke duusare jaj justise rohington nariman ko bhi uplabdh rahanaa chahie
 The Supreme Court can hear the matter on Monday
 yachikakartaon ne justise deepak mishra se kaha ki centre sarkaar apane notification ko waapas lenaa chaahati he, lekin sunwaayee se pehle centre ko notification waapas na lene diya jaae
 Justice Mishra said that we want the matter to be heard on Monday, but the second judge of the bench, Justice Rohington Nariman, should also be available
 justise mishra ne kaha ki ham chaahate hai ki is maamle kii sunwaayee somvaar ko karen, lekin bench ke duusare jaj justise rohington nariman ko bhi uplabdh rahanaa chahie

 The Paspalat pair of Bihar: Nitish Kumar, Chief Minister, Bihar Laloo Prasad Yadav, Chief, RJD, Bihar's biggest party Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad together, the feat achieved in 2015 would be unusual
 inhone narendra modi ke netritv vaali bijepi ko bihar ke chunaav main dhul chataa di
 It was the second largest political victory after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 is kamyaabi kaa sahi andaja haalanki us duuri se lagaaya ja saktaa he jo in donon ne 2015 main ek-duusare ke kareeb aane ke liye tay kii
 They were friends first, then became arch enemies and became friends again last year
 janvari main haalat yah thi ki nitish kaa siyaasi kariyar takreeban bikharane ke kagaar par aa chukaa tha
 After the embarrassment of the Lok Sabha elections, he had to face the challenge of keeping the party organization connected after leaving the post of Chief Minister and the price he had to pay for Manjhi's betting on him
 aakhirkaar farvari 2015 main unhone maanjhi ko pad se hataa diya or unka kayakalp ek saahsee, spasht or jokhim uthaane vaale netaa ke taur par hua
 He apologized to the public for the Manjhi episode and slowly turned to Congress, which was historically close to Lalu's RJD
 lalu kii haalat or buree thi
 After performing poorly in three assembly and two Lok Sabha elections, Lalu was fighting for his political survival
 isse bhi bura yah hua ki chaara ghotaale main doshi paae jane ke kaaran unhen chunaav ladgaye ke ayogy tehra diya gaya
 Now he emerges as a troubled father who was fighting to establish his two sons in politics & a little cautious, a little nervous and blunt
 donon ne milakar vot kaa ganit majbootee se saadhaa jo vipakshi endie ke liye tarikban durjey ban gaya
 Election, however, is beyond mathematics
 sawaal hameshaa se yahi tha ki donon ek-duusare ke kitna kareeb aa sakenge
 Even though Lalu agreed to be a part of the grand alliance and finally sealed Nitish's name for the post of chief minister, this alliance kept appearing and appearing in the grip of confusion, separation and despair
 yah sthiti agast tak bani rahi
 After this, however, things changed rapidly
 siton ke vitaran se lekar ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa tak or ant main ek-duusare ke pratyaashiyon ke liye prachaar karne kii yojana tak lalu or nitish ke bich adarsh santulan or sadbhaav kaayam rahaa
 This pair is also the reason for rash today for one to one political additions
 bekhauf aam aadmi kii dhamaakedaar vaapasi:arvind kejariwal, mukhyamantri, dilliyah saal to arvind kejariwal ke naam nahin hona tha, dur-dur tak aisi koi gunjaaish nahin dikh rahi thi
 All the political pundits and najumis of the country had the idea that the time had come and passed by the former income tax officer, RTI activist, leader of the Lokpal movement, the head of the Aam Aadmi Party
 lekin dilli ke purv mukhyamantri ne satta main vaapasi kaa aisa tanabana buna, or bijepi rupi mahakay siyaasi mashin ko aise bemaani bana diya, jo bhartiya raajnneeti main ab tak nahin dekha-suna gaya tha
 In 2015, Kejriwal challenged Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his new stronghold and encouraged the BJP to make such mistakes that he almost handed over the post of Chief Minister of Delhi to him in a saucer
 kul 70 main 67 siton par unki jeet main bilashak aakhri maukey par ek bahari kiran bedi ko netaa ghoshit karne kii bijepi kii hadabadi madadgaar bani
 Its impact was so historic that it made the invincible Modi look pale
 ve chaaron ore se virdohi awaajon se ghirne lage
 Writers-artists campaigned for a "return of respect" while at the end of the year Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad shook the BJP in the Bihar elections
 bakaul mukhyamantri kejariwal puure saal khabaron main bane rahe
 At first, in his party, "dissidents" like Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan showed the way out and then looted the headlines by taking the lead on corruption and pollution
 centre sarkaar ne uparajyapal najeeb jang ke jariye unke liye jo rode khadey kiye, kejariwal ne unhen apane haq main istemaal karne kii kalabaji bhi bakhubi dikhaai
 Through his radio broadcasts and fearless interviews, he proved to be the tallest leader in the country after Modi
 -kunal pradhaipani jameen ke vaaris: rahul gandhi, upaadhyaksh, congressvarsh 2015 ke pehle, rahul gandhi desh ke ahm masalon par khaskar apni chuppiyon, yaa odhi gai udaseenta se hi surkhiyaan pate rahe
 His silence continued to break with some dramatic antics
 masalan, apni hi party kii aguai vaali sarkaar ke ek adhyadesh kii pratiyaan fadkar use “bakawaas” bataa diya
 Or to empower the Dalits, introduced the formula of "unnatural motion like planet Jupiter" which some could not understand, became a spice of laughter for the rest
 phir, 2014 kii garmiyaan jaise apmaan kaa hathaudaa barasaa gayi
 The Congress was reduced to 44 mps in its worst phase
 rahul party kii kaman lene ke pehle hi bemaani sabit ho gaye
 The 2015 debut took place at a similar time
 congress upaadhyaksh rahasyamay tareeke se gaayab ho gaye
 His party announced his leave after the budget session of Parliament began on 23 February
 lekin rahul isi gumnami ke daur main apni aawaaj paa gaye
 He spent three weeks vipassana in his 56 days of anonymity, during which complete silence is kept
 phir, ve 19 april ko dilli ke ramlila maidan main bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak ke khilaaf congress kii raily main namoodaar hue or sansad ke varshakalin satr ko lagbhag thapp karne main apni party ke saansadon kii aguai kii
 They were still looking for slick dialogues and idioms
 lekin is baar unka nayaa jumala “suut-boot kii sarkaar” chal niklaa
 The government finally handed over that bill to the waste basket on 30 August
 chaahe choti hi sahi, yah rahul ke liye badi jeet thi
 But to increase the morale of the party, silence and anonymity were not going to work anymore
 isliye desh bhar main padayatraaon ko daur shuru hua
 He continued to travel in economy class, strolled in the Chennai floods and was also active on Twitter
 virdohi phija ko maukey main badal lene kii kala unki daadi indira gandhi ne bakhubi dikhaai thi
 However, in this digital era, 2016 will come with the condition that before you speak, think before you think and others think, speak before that

 The court was hearing this on Tuesday
 ab asaram 14 din tak nyaayik hiraasat main rahenge
 However, the defense lawyers have said that after studying the order, they will apply for bail in the High Court
 vahiin sarkari paksh ne kaha ki unke tarkon kii jeet hui or adaalat ne asaram ko reeha nahin kiya kyonki vah baahar aakar saboot auki jaanch prabhavit kar saktaa tha
 Asaram is currently lodged in Jodhpur Central Jail
 asaram ne apni jamaanat ke liye dilli or mumbai ke aalaa vakeelon kii fouj juta rakhi thi
 He was walking restlessly in the jail since morning and two lawyers were sitting there to give the verdict on the bail application
 magar shaam ko paanch baje die apane faisle main court ne unki ummid todakar faisla diya
 Now he is bound to remain in jail till the debate in the High Court
 ye hai asaram kii jamaanat khaarij hone kii do vajahenasaram kaa vakil kah rahaa tha ki ladki balig he or isliye naaballig ke yon utpeedan ke tahat darj kii gai exiaar ko khaarij kar diya janaa chahie
 But the government side presented the girl's high school certificate and approved a Supreme Court case
 asaram kaa vakil bolaa ki meraa muvakkil bahut boodha or biimaar he, use medical madad chahie
 On this, the government side said that a man is old when the mind thinks something else and the body refuses to obey him
 asaram puri tarah se sakriy hai, jagah-jagah jaakar pravachan de rahe the, ab achaanak beemaari kii baat hone lagi
 The second important point in Bell's dismissal was Shilpa and Prakash, two of Asaram's fugitives, escaping from police custody
 sarkari vakil anand purohit ne tark diya ki agar asaram jail par baahar aata he, to cese kii jaanch prabhavit karegaa or baaki aropiyon ko bargala saktaa he
 The police, the victim and the media were also threatened by ACP Chanchal Sharma of Angle Rajasthan police told on record that his DCP is constantly receiving threats from Asaram's group
 peedit ladki ke pita ne bhi court main bataaya ki unhen maamla waapas lene kii dhamkiyaan di ja rahi hai
 The protests against the court's decision also weakened Asaram's case
 bole sarkari vakil, mere paas hai 100 hathiyaarjit ke josh se bhare anand purohit ne pehle to media ko anushaasan par gyaan pilaayaa
 Then said that i think no one can give a justice in India, the biggest blow to such person
 nyaay sabko baraabar maanata he
 a man is not big or small
 main dhanyavad detaa hum media ko ki aise matter ko bakhubi uthaaya he
 In the last, the priest said that he had a weapon, so i also went to the debate with 100 weapons
 lagata he chanki pandey kii beti ananyaa pandey bollywood main kadam rakhte hi chaa jane ke iraade se ai hai

 '' bataa den ki naina se yahaan matlab film 'ye javaani he divaani' main deepika padukon ke kirdaar se he, jiskaa naam naina talwaar tha
 It is believed that Ananya's look in this boomerang could be a clue about her character in husband wife and she

 De Villiers and Miller's run-out can be considered the turning point of the match

 a total of three players were run out in this match
 champions trophy main bhartiya team ne sarvaadhik 6 ran out kiye hai
 Kohli's mind game Imran Tahir's run out was the result of Virat Kohli's quickness
 kohli field par apni furti ke liye jane jate hai
 He used his quickness and cunning in the last run out of the African team
 video main saaf dekha ja saktaa he ki gend jab viraat kohli kii ore aati he to pehle wo gend ko roak kar chhod dete hai
 After which the batsmen feel that the ball has been left out

 com / 7gj1lie9qh — Captains (@dhonikohli_fc) June 11, 2017 uttar pradesh 10veen or 12veen board parikshaayen aaj se shuru ho gai hai
 After achieving a major achievement in cracking down on cheating last year, strict steps are being taken to stop cheating in the examination this time too
 isse pehle bhi upi sarkaar ne pradesh main padhai ke str ko ooncha uthaane ke liye kai kaary kiye hai
 Know what are the important steps taken by the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath government
 
 
 taiyaar kiya nayaa softwareis baar uttar pustikaon main badlaav hone se bachane ke liye ek software banaaya he, jisase puri process par najar rakhi jaaegi
 Also, a four-step process has been prepared, the process under which copies will be distributed and tested
 saath hi kaapiyon par code lagaae jaaenge or paper ke set bhi banaae jaaenge
 Timely Examinations and Resulting Government has been successful in organizing the exams at the right time and releasing the results only days after the exam is over
 pichley saal bhi sarkaar ne tay samay pariksha kaa aayojan kar jald hi nattejey jari kiye the, jisaki vajah se 12veen ke baad padhai karne vaale vidhyaarthiyon ko kahin admician lene main dikkat naa ho
 This time also, the examination is being conducted in February and it is being told that the results of the exam will also be released soon
 nakal par lagaai lagaam-sarkaar kaa daawa rahaa he ki board ne nakal par lagaam lagane main safalataa hasil kii he
 Last year also, due to the steps taken by the government to stop cheating, 10 lakh candidates had left the exam in the middle because of cheating on cheating
 is vajah se is baar bhi nakal ke dar se kam logon ne aavedan kiya he
 This time too, the number of candidates has decreased by 9 lakhs
 ensiiarti course-upi board ne shiksha ke str ko badhaane ke liye ensiiarti course lagu karne kii yojana bhi banaai he
 In this decision taken in January last year, it was said that now students of UP board will also study NCERT course
 videshi bhashaa-har board pariksha main ek vishay third language kaa bhi rakhata he or upi board main aisa tha
 However, now the talk of adding foreign languages to these languages is also being revealed
 isse upi board se padhai karne vaale vidhyaarthee bhi ab videshi bhashaaon kii padhai kar sakenge
 Examination Center - UP board used to face a lot of problems regarding the examination center, but now according to the new policy of the government, the examination center of the candidates will not be more than 20 kilometers away
 rus ne libya ke shaasha muammar gaddaphi ke shashan ke dauraan urja pariyojnaon ke liye hue samjhaute ke bhavishya par charchaa ke liye libian vidrohiyon ke netritv vaali rashtriya asthaayee parishad ke adhikariyon ko aamantrit kiya he
 According to the news agency RIA Novosti, before the start of the conflict in Libya, the Russian energy company, Gazprom, had signed an agreement with Italy's energy company, Eni, under which 11 of Libya
 30 karod euro keemat vaali elephant tel evam gas pariyojna main ani kii 33 pratishat hissedari kharidi jaani thi
 The deal was not completed, as it required clearance from the Libyan side
 roosi videsh mantri sargei lavarove ne shanivaar ko kaha ki libya main roosi urja yojana ke bhavishya par charchaa kii pahal rashtriya asthaayee parishad ke pratinidhiyon kii ore se kii gai he
 Lavrov said during a summit meeting of former Soviet Union leaders in Tajikistan, "they have proposed discussion
 hamane unke anurodh par kuch (libian) adhikariyon ko masco aamantrit kiya he
 "be aware that Russia had established a relationship with Gaddafi and until recently it did not want to recognize the new Libyan government
 philhal gaddaphi ke thikaane kaa kuch ata-pataa nahin he
 The future of the russia-italy energy agreement in Libya is unclear, as Western countries have also shown interest in the Elephant project

 @shahidkapoor # mirakapoora post shared by Viral Bhayani (@viralbhayani) on Sep 6, 2018 at 5:39am PDT The BJP government is being formed in Maharashtra and Haryana
 devendra fadanvis or manohar laal khatter hi mukhyamantri honge
 Prime Minister Modi and BJP national president Amit Shah have both praised the past tenure and congratulated them for the future
 is chunaav main janata ne apni taraf se vipaksh ko bhi majboot kiya he
 Has not given power
 vipaksh ke kheme main agar dekhen to ladaai rashtravaadi congress party or jananaayak janata party ne hi ladi baaki congress ko lekar yahi kaha ja rahaa he ki uske ummidavaar to lard rahe the magar party nazar nahin aa rahi thi
 The story of this election begins with the talk of two pictures of the Maharashtra elections
 jo prachaar kii aandhi taiyaar karne waalon par baari pad gai
 This photo of Sharad Pawar giving a speech in the rain is of 19 October
 satara loksabhaa kshetra kii
 Pawar, 79, kept getting wet and gave a speech for half an hour
 satara loksabhaa upachunaav main pavaar us ummidavaar ke khilaaf prachaar kar rahe the jo 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main unheen kii party se jeeta tha
 Udayan Raj Bhonsle, considered a descendant of Shiv Sena, resigned from his seat and was fighting BJP
 is seat se udayan raaj teen baar jeet chuke the magar bijepi ke tikat se haar gaye
 Now look at this picture of the BJP in front of this drenched picture of Pawar, which was described by the BJP as an iconic picture
 lagata he ki puri planig se ye tasviir lee gai he taaki shivaji kii profile se pradhanmantri modi kii profile match kar jaae
 Both started to look the same in the same frame, but this iconic seat did not yield much results
 yah sahi he ki panwel kii yah tasviir he or yahaan se bijepi ke ummidavaar kii jeet hui he
 If the magic of this iconic seat had worked, the BJP would have been forming the government alone
 pavaar kii tasviir zarur ikonic ban gai
 His government may not have been formed, but his party reinvigorated its fort
 pavaar kii yah tasviir thake-buje vipaksh ke netaaon ke bich kisi kinvadanti kii tarah dekhi jaaegi, suni jaaegi
 What will be the role of Shiv Sena? Uddhav Thackeray is talking about 50-50 formula
 dhai saal bijepi or dhai saal shivasena kaa mukhyamantri kaa formula tay hua tha
 This formula neither ran between the SP-BSP in UP nor the PDP-BJP in Jammu and Kashmir
 shivasena ko pichhali baar kii tarah 63 siten to nahin mili hai, lekin bijepi 20-22 siten kam ho gayi
 The Shiv Sena felt that it had the chance to become an elder brother again
 uddhav thakare ne kaha ki sarkaar kisi hogi baat karne ke liye amit shah ko bhi aane kii zararut pad sakati he, lekin sarkaar ke mukhiya kaa elaan to dilli main hi ho gaya
 Even when Uddhav Thackeray also said that he would not leave room for BJP every time
 maharashtra kii raajnneeti main ek dal kaa varchasv nahin he
 It has become as it was before
 aisa laga tha ki devend fadanvis ne apni party ke bheetar or baahar sabko nipta diya he, vaisaa nahin hai
 Apart from Shiv Sena, NCP, Congress has also done well
 31 siten to nirdaleey or nae dalon ko ai hai
 People have contested elections in Maharashtra
 janata apane muddon ke liye lard rahi thi, lekin partiyaan apane muddon par janata ko ladava rahe the
 The media was contesting with the ruling party
 prachaar kii aandhi janata kii hawa ke saamne fail ho gai
 Maharashtra does not belong to any one, but BJP is the largest party
 mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ko kyon kahana padaa ki 15 apaksh vidhayakon ne unase sampark kiya he or wo saport ke liye taiyaar hai
 Sharad Pawar is also saying that he will not form a government with the Shiv Sena
 ensipi ne apana pradarshan acha kar liya
 Which was believed to be finished
 congress ke bhi saaf hone kii baat kahi ja rahi thi magar uske ummidavaaron ne acha pradarshan kiya he, lekin aisa congress ke pradarshan se to nahin hua
 The role of a strong opposition has been found
 raajnneeti ke lihaaz se dekhen to jis dhanagar samaaj ke zarie pavaar ko rokane kii koshish kii gai thi
 Pawar's party has won more seats than the BJP in the Dhangar-dominated region
 pankaja munde 30,000 voton se chunaav haar gai hai
 Ajit Pawar of Baramati to NCP is the leader with the most votes in Maharashtra
 1 lakh 65 hazaar 265 voton se bijepi ke ummidavaar ko haraaya he
 Sharad Pawar is going to Satara on Friday to thank
 diwali ke baad rajya kaa daura karenge
 What happened in Haryana? Exit poll claims were not accounted for, but even after 7 seats less than last time, Prime Minister Modi is calling Haryana's victory unprecedented
 vipaksh or visheshgy manohar laal khatter ko bijepi ke kharaab pradarshan kaa kaaran bataa rahe hon, lekin pradhanmantri ne manohar laal khatter kii tarif kar di
 He was again declared to be the Chief Minister
 jananaayak janata party ko 10 siten mili hai or congress ko 31
 Congress gained 16 seats
 magar sarkaar nahin ban pai
 Perhaps the Congress would have supported the public if they had fought elections
 kya maharashtra kii tarah haryana kii janata bhi apana chunaav khud lard rahi thi? is chunaav kaa sandesh saaf he
 The public is the opposition
 manohar laal khatter naaraa de rahe the abaki baar 75 baar
 7 seats reduced
 bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh haar gaye
 Many ministers lost
 phir bhi pradhanmantri ise abhootpurv jeet bataa rahe hai
 Khattar's own margin of victory narrowed
 2014 main karnal se khatter 63773 voton se jite the
 This time won by 45,188 votes
 dushyant chautaala par aaj kaaphi focus rahaa, laga ki bagaiyr unke sarkaar nahin banegi
 But now it does not seem so
 haryana main congress or jajpa ke milakar sarkaar banane kii sambhaavna samaapt ho gai he
 If the BJP has emerged as the largest party, then it will be invited to form the government
 bijepi bahumat se sirf 5 ank dur he, jise jutanaa bahut mushkil nahin he
 This is Amit Shah style
 siten kam hoti hai magar kam hona haar nahin hoti
 At the party headquarters in Delhi, BJP national president Amit Shah was accompanied by Prime Minister Modi
 raksha mantri rajnath singh or nitin gadakari bhi aae
 BJP acting president JP Nadda was also there
 karnataka chunaav main bijepi ko spasht jeet nahin mili thi phir bhi isi mukhyalay par aae the
 At night
 bhaashan main jeet kaa jazbaa jhalak rahaa tha is baar bhi
 BJP national president Amit Shah said that in Modi-2, BJP has moved ahead by winning both the first elections
 haryana main 3 pratishat adhik vot mili hai
 The biggest party is made
 amit shah ne devendra fadanvis or manohar laal khatter donon kii tarif kii he kaha he ki donon rajyon kii janata ne hamaare mukhyamantriyon ke kaam par thappa lagane kaa kaam kiya he
 Both congratulated and congratulated them
 kya amit shah ne yah saaf kar diya ki bijepi kahin bhi sahyogi ke dabaav main apana mukhyamantri nahin badalane ja rahi he
 On this occasion, Amit Shah mentioned the irregular colonies of Delhi and told that both elections have passed
 aage kii sochna he
 After this, the Prime Minister also addressed the workers
 unhone bhi aaj ke nateezon ko unki sarkaron ke prati janata kaa vishwaas bataaya he
 The Prime Minister described the victory of Haryana as an unprecedented victory
 shiv puja kaa sabase paavan din he somvaar or is shiv mandiron main bhakton kaa baari jamaavada dekha ja saktaa he
 Among all the Devas, Shiva is the only God who becomes very happy with the devotion and worship of his devotees
 shiv bhole ko aadi or anant mana gaya he jo prithvi se lekar akaash or jal se lekar agni har tatv main virajman hai
 Many such things are offered in Shiva Puja which are not offered to any other deity, such as Aka, Bilvapatra, cannabis etc
 isi tarahashiv puja main kai aisi chijen hoti hanjo aapaki puja kaa fal dene kii bajaay aapako nuksaan pahunchaa sakati hai
 
 
 1
 haldi:haldi khanpan kaa swaad to badhaati he saath hi dharmik kaaryon main bhi haldi kaa mahatvapurn sthaan mana gaya he
 But turmeric is not offered in the worship of Shiva
 haldi upyog mukhya rup se saundarya prashaadhan main kiya jaataa he
 According to the scriptures, Shivling is a symbol of masculinity, that is why turmeric is not offered to Mahadev
 2
 Flowers: Shiva does not like red flowers except Kaner and Kamal

 jo dost aapke hometown main hai unhen hameshaa phone karte rahen
 Talking to them will make you feel refreshed
 jo dost aapke hi shahar main hai, unase bhi bich-bich main milane kaa plan banaate rahen
 5
 apane room se baahar nikalen:college main apane class main baithe rahanaa bahut aasaan hota he
 But it prevents you from meeting new people, trying new things and experiencing college life
 apane class room se baahar jaaen
 Sit in college canteen, go to library, participate in activities
 apane dimag ko duusari jagah lagaaein
 This will keep you busy in other tasks and you will not miss home

 Rating: 2 Stardirector: Umang Kumar Kalakar: When will Aishwarya Rai, Randeep Hooda, Richa Chadha and Darshan Kumar realize that making a biopic is not like making a normal film that a big star is captured and made a film in a year and makes someone's life completely Painted commercially
 yah kisi kii jindagi or uske bhoge yatharth ko dikhaanaa hota he
 While the director making the biopic can make a film in three-four years (bhaag Milkha Bhaag), Umang Kumar has made two biopic in two years
 'mairi com' sitambar 2014 main relies hui thi
 At that time too, questions were raised about Priyanka Chopra's choice
 ab'sarbajit'main aishwarya raay ko lekar bhi kuch aise hi sawaal paidaa hote hai
 The film does not accidentally take the person and his family to life on the screen, as it should have
 yah bhi gajab he ki aishwarya bollywood main vaapasi ke baad chilla-chillaakar bolne ko apni euaspy bananaa chaah rahi hai yaa bollywood ke diarector jaanboojhkar unase aisa karvaa rahe hai
 How powerful the story is of Kesrabjit (randeep Hooda) of Bhikhiwind village in Punjab
 vah kisaan he
 She has a sister Aishwarya Rai and her wife Richa Chadha
 uski do betiyaan hai
 But one day, while drunk, he walks into the Pakistan border and is arrested
 bas yaheen se uski jindagi badal jaati he
 The never ending phase of prison, charges and torture begins
 jab uske parivaar or bahan ko pataa chalata he ki vah pakistan main kaid he to phir aishwarya raay use chhudaane ke liye jute jaati he
 Though the story is of Sarabjit but the entire focus of the director has been on Aishwarya Rai Bachchan
 shaayad badi heroinon par umang kumaar kuch zyada hi bharosa karte hai
 Hence, Randeep and Richa all become secondary after a time in the film and only Aishwarya Rai remains
 star apilalogon nedelbir korako dekha he
 Heard on TV and she still appears today
 yahi sabase badi dikkat he
 Because of this, they are compared with Aishwarya
 lukvij ve kahin bhi dalbir jaisi nahin lagatee
 Many years of age pass but Aishwarya's hair is only white, the rest of the gestures remain the same
 unka uccharan gadabad he
 There are some scenes where she has been fine but overall the director's choice about the emotions disappoints
 film main kuch dekhne laayak he to vah randeep hooda hai
 The way he has introduced himself in the role is amazing
 unhone khud ko puri tarah badal diya or sarbajit ban baithe
 His gestures, and speech are excellent
 yatnaa sahanaa or jail main pal-pal sisakna parade par jivit ho jaataa he
 Indeed, Randeep has once again got his art to be ironed
 unke baad, richaa chaddha bina bole bhi kaaphi kuch kah jaati hai
 However, in front of the big actress like Aishwarya, the director must have found Richa younger only when the period was also kept short for her
 kamai kii baatumang kumaar ise dil ko chhu lene vaali byopic banane main puri tarah chookte najar aate hai
 He was trying to show the struggle of a sister
 unke iraade beshak achche rahe hai lekin atyadhik vyavsaayik soch film ko patari se utaar detii he
 Overall, the entire film seems to be made for Aishwarya Rai
 unke hardkor phans ke liye yah film ho sakati he
 Those expecting a brilliant biopic from 'sarabjeet' can surely be disappointed

 2008 vidhansabha chunaav kaa rigelt (jaipur)is chunaav main jile main kul 35,38,921 matadaat the or 22,58,054 (63

 jabaki sabase zyada 10 siten bijepi ne jiti thim
 BJP - 10 seats Congress - 7 seats Loktantrik Samajwadi Party - 1 seat Candidate - 1 seat Result of 2013 Assembly Election (jaipur) In this election the district had a total of 39,11,600 votes and 28,76,745 (73)

 Apart from 17 others, BSP won 6 seats and CPM 3 seats
 congress ne ashok gahalot ke netritv main rajasthan main sarkaar banaai thi, lekin jaipur jile main bijepi ne congress par lead kaayam rakhte hue congress se 3 seat zyada jiti thim

 After this, when the anti-incumbency wave started in the 2013 assembly elections, the BJP made a clean sweep in Jaipur district including the entire state
 kul 200 vidhansabha siton main 163 par bijepi ko jeet mili or jaipur kii 19 siton main se 16 siton par uske ummidavaaron ne paracham laharaaya
 The Congress could win only one seat in Jaipur
 is tarah jab bijepi ne apana sarvshereshth pradarshan kiya to jaipur jile kii zyaadaatar siton par uske ummidavaar jite or congress dharaashai ho gai
 Something similar was seen in the 2017 Gujarat Assembly elections
 jahaan surat jile kii 18 siton main congress sirf 3 siton par jeet pai thi, jo bijepi kii satta vaapasi main ek bada factor sabit hui thi or use 15 siten mili thim
 Whereas in rural areas, Congress got better results than expected
 surat kaa zikr isliye bhi mahatvapurn hai, kyonki vahaan chunaav main sabase ahm bhoomika ashok gahalot ne nibhaai thi
 Rahul Gandhi was also satisfied with Gehlot's performance, after which he was given important responsibility in national politics
 haalanki, rajasthan main pratyaksh taur par kaman ashok gahalot ke haathon main nahin he, lekin unki bhoomika kaaphi mahatvapurn maani ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, it has to be seen what strategy the Congress is pursuing to win Jaipur by performing well in the by-elections and local body elections under the leadership of Sachin Pilot
 ye bhi dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki ashok gahalot jaise bade ranneetikaar kii maujuudagi main congress ke yuva netaaon rahul or sachin payalat kii jodi jaipur ke shahari aabaadi ko kitna prabhavit kar paati he

 Under the Shakti policy, the government is ready to make several changes in the rules for giving coal to power companies
 kol linkage bhi ab power companiyon ko nilaamee ke jariye koyala milegaa
 Power companies which do not have coal linkage will benefit from the new rule

 jin companiyon ke paas pipie hone ke baad bhi kol linkage nahin he, unhen bhi shakti policy ke tahat ab raahat milegi
 There are about 12 thousand MW plants, which have ppas but do not have coal
 is policy ke baad ab bijli companiyaan kol linkage hasil karne ke liye kol india notyphoid price par bid laga sakengi
 But these linkages will be given to the Central Generating Companies, State and Joint Ventures only on the basis of the recommendations of the Power Ministry
 is tarah bhavishya main kol linkage kaa aavanton paardarshee or biding aadhaarit hoga
 The policy will also boost the infrastructure and banking sectors by emphasizing the availability of coal to power sector projects

 The bitterness between Maulana Ahmad Bukhari and the SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav, the royal imam of the Jijama Mosque, came to the fore as soon as the SP government in Uttar Pradesh completed one year
 imam ne mulaayam se apane man mutaav ko aise shabdon main jaahir kiya ki ab sulah ke koi asaar najar nahin aa rahe hai

 Two minutes 26 seconds
 dilli ke chidyaghar se nikali dil ko kachot dene vaali puri kehani bas inhen do minute 26 second main simati he
 Between life and death between a human and an animal, a unilateral game of check and check was played
 ek khel jiske shuru hone se pehle hi jindagi or maut kaa faisla ho chukaa tha
 Maqsood cast his life into the darkness of oblivion, but death gave him the name
 dilli ke anand parvat ilaake main mazdooree kar guzar basar karne vaale makasuud se kam hi log waakif the
 Even those who knew him, just as an opinionated and mentally ill person
 lekin makasuud ko aisi maut mili ki har ghar main uski tasviir pahunch gai
 Maqsudmaksood used to drive a rickshaw, these days he used to earn Rs 60-65 by driving a rickshaw in the industrial area
 mangalvaar ko bhi wo gharavaalon ko kaam par jane kii baat kah kar niklaa tha
 But he did not go to work and reached the zoo and then late in the morning, news of his death reached the family
 gharavaalon ne pashchim bengal ke vardhaman kii rahanevaali ek ladki se uski shaadi bhi karwaai thi
 But it was probably Maqsood's mood, due to which his wife also left him
 jis baagh ne pichley 6 saal main kabhi kisi bakre tak kaa shikaar naa kiya ho, usee baagh ne faqat 2 minute 26 second main makasuud kii jaan le lee
 The reality behind this incident creates regret, because according to the experts, this tiger did not want to kill the tiger that fell in its enclosure
 lekin jane-anjaane insaanon ne wo galati kar di jiske baad baagh ko gussa aa gaya or usne ek bebas insaan kii jaan le lee
 The photos bear witness that the tiger did not want to kill Maqsood
 kam se kam shuruaati chand lamhon kii tasviren to yahi kahati hai
 In spite of Maqsood, a tiger did not attack him despite falling into the enclosure of a human, but was trying to understand or play with him
 maut kaa trigar bana wo patharvijay naam kaa vah baagh agar chahta to makasuud ke baade main girte hi us par hamalaa kar saktaa tha
 Could catch him
 lekin wo makasuud ke kareeb aakar use gaur se dekhne laga
 Even Vijay tried to touch and grasp him with the claws a couple of times and his tail moved in the air as if he was trying to play with him
 lekin honi ko shaayad kuch or hi manjuur tha
 In fact, amidst the negligence of the zoo administration, only a crowd of people tried to save Maqsood in his own way
 lekin isi koshish main bheed ne jaise hi baagh ko ek pathar maaraa, gussaye baagh ne makasuud kii gardan pakad lee
 Wildlife experts who saw those painful photographs of death also say that if the Zoo administration had shown promptness then, Maqsood's life could have been saved
 khud ju prashasan bhi ye baat maanata he ki chah saal ke is baagh ne apni puri umr main kabhi shikaar nahin kiya
 Being a man-eater is far from over, as Vijay was born to a couple named Lakshmana and Yamuna who were already locked in Rewa's zoo
 aise main vijay ko uski maa se naa to shikaar kii training mili or naa hi uske kabhi kisi jaanavar ko maaraa
 However, in Delhi, he used to run his work only with ten kilos of meat received from the Zoo administration every day
 yahaan tak ki khaane ke maamle main bhi vijay aalsee mizaaj hi he
 According to the employees of Xu, even ten kilos of meat he gets daily is not in a hurry, but he eats again and again in several hours
 bahut mumkin he ki mangalvaar ko bhi vijay apane baade main aa gire makasuud ko baksh detaa, agar ju prashasan pehle hi uskaa dhyaan banta kar use makasuud se dur karne main kaamyaab ho jaataa
 The first and necessary condition for him was to remove other people from his farm
 lekin ye sab karne main prashasan kii kahili makasuud ke liye jaanaleva sabit hui

 To this day, the country's first female Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated in 1984 and on Wednesday she is 34 vampunyathithi
 fauladi iraadon or nidar faislon vaali desh kii pehali or ekmaatr mahila pradhanmantri indira gandhi ko is din subah savere unke sikh body gards ne maut ke ghat utaar diya tha
 Indira Gandhi took over the reins of the country for three consecutive times between 1966 and 1977 and then reached the post again in 1980 and was assassinated on 31 October 1984 while still in office
 indira kaa janm 19 november 1917 ko elahabaad main hua tha, jinke bachapan kaa naam priyadarshini tha
 She was a soft-spoken woman with an effective personality and knew the skill to implement her tough decisions with sheer boldness
 unhone june 1984 main amritsar main sikhon ke pavitra sthal swarna mandir se aatankwaadiyon ko baahar nikaalane ke liye sainya karrwai ko anjaam diya tha
 Apart from this, the announcement of the Emergency in 1975 and subsequent developments is also seen as a harsh decision
 swatantra bharat ke itihaas main yah sabase vivadaspad kaal tha
 Elections were postponed during the Emergency
 ise aaazaad bharat kaa sabase vivaadaaspad daur bhi mana jaataa he
 The next morning, on 26 June, the entire nation heard the declaration of emergency in the voice of Indira Gandhi on the radio

 India's record of staying victorious on their own land was also broken by the defeat in the Test series at the hands of England and now the ODI series at the hands of Pakistan
 dhoni ne kaha, 'jab aap badlaav ke daur se guzarate ho to tab aap chaahate ho ki aapke senior khilaadi acha pradarshan karke yuva khilaadiyon ko sikhaane main madad karen
 When two or three wickets fall, there should be someone who will withstand the pressure and make the innings work

 i also said last time i love being a punching bag
 in tasveeron ko dekhakar aap soch ho rahe honge ki itani kapakapaati sardi ke baavjood ye log pant utarkar kyon gum rahe hai
 So let us tell you that like every year, on January 12 this year, 'no Pants Subway Ride Day' was celebrated in many parts of the world including America
 tasveeron main dekhen no pants de kaa najaara'no pants subway ride de' ke tahat america ke neuyork, atlanta, spain ke madrid, china ke beijing or landan main logon ne ek din bina pants ke undervier main guzaara
 Actually, 'no Pants Subway Ride Day' was started 13 years ago by a famous theater group called 'evaprove'
 is group ke sadasyon ne neuyork main pehali baar 'no pants subway ride de' manaaya, jo ab duniya bhar main mashhoor ho chukaa he
 Under 'no Pants Subway Ride Day', passengers board the metro from different stations without wearing pants
 event main shaamil hone vaale log kot, hat, scorv or gloves samet sabakuch pahante hai sivaae pants ke
 When the participants involved in the event rode in the metro without wearing pants on Sunday, some people were trying their best to remove their eyes, some were staring at them and some were staring at them

 Mukul Roy, who was a special figure of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, on Friday joined the BJP but did not show the enthusiasm which usually appears on such occasions
 kehane ko dilli sthit bijepi mukhyalay main purv trinmul congress netaa mukul roy kaa swaagat karne ke liye kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad or bijepi ke bengal prabharee kailash vijayawargeey bhi maujuud the
 But there was neither any slogan shouting from the supporters nor rose petals were visible
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki maano roy ko party main samyojit karne kaa faisla buje man se liya gaya he
 The hands of Roy could not be easily washed away by the stains of alleged corruption
 roy sarada chitfund ghotaale main CBI kii jaanch ke radar par rahe hai
 This is the same scam that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah have been raising in BJP rallies in West Bengal
 haalanki roy ne ghotaale main apni kisi bhoomika se hameshaa inkaar kiya he
 On the other hand, sources associated with the Trinamool Congress are apprehensive that Roy may not provide such important clues to the CBI that it would be easy for the agency to prosecute other TMC leaders
 sarada aise ghotaalon main se ek he jinase nimna madhya varg or garib sabase zyada prabhavit hue hai
 His lifetime earnings fell due to this scam
 iske baad narda ghotaalaa aayaa jisamen TMC netaa sting main ghoose lete dikhe
 Roy's status, once considered the most powerful leader in the TMC after Mamata Banerjee, can be gauged from the fact that in 2012, he was made a minister of important affairs like Railways in the Manmohan Singh cabinet
 ab vahi roy pashchim bengal main bijepi kaa cheharaa honge
 The BJP does not have any rubber to wipe out the past from Roy's slate that his name also came in the sting and the CBI had also registered an FIR against him
 roy pravartan nideshaalay (ED) kii jaanch ke daayre main bhi aae the
 In such a situation, the dilemma of sharing the stage with Roy of the central leadership of the party, BJP Party, which calls for purity and morality, can be understood
 sankshipt bhaashan main kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne roy ko anbhavi netaa bataaya lekin phir anya jagah vyastata kaa hawala dekar is kaarykram se jaldi vidaai bhi le lee
 Even before this, Roy had to wait for a while outside the BJP headquarters at '11, Ashok Road 'as Kailash Vijayvargiya had not yet arrived
 roy aisa abhas nahin dena chaahate the ki unhen bijepi main shaamil hone ke liye intjaar karnaa padaa
 The story does not end here
 bijepi kii pashchim bengal unit to roy kii bhagava camp main entry ko lekar puri tarah vimukh dikhaai di
 Except Chandra Bose, no significant face from Bengal BJP appeared on this occasion
 bataa den ki chandra bose ne bhi haal main hi bijepi ke camel ko thama he
 However, BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha, who was also the former president of the party's Bengal unit, is said to have a good relationship with Roy
 darasal, rahul sinha ne kuch din pehle roy ko apane janmdiwas par nyotaa bhi diya tha
 But a thing like Rahul Sinha cannot be said for Roy and BJP leaders
 yahaan tak ki bengal bijepi ke adhyaksh dilip ghosh ne roy ke bijepi main swaagat ko lekar apane aadhikarik handle se koi twit bhi nahin kiya
 However, when Ghosh's associates drew attention, he filled in a tweet on Twitter by Kailash Vijayvargiya about Roy's entry into the BJP
 pashchim bengal main bijepi kaa mahila cheharaa maani jane vaaleen rajyasabha saansad roopa ganguli ne ye report likhe jane tak roy ko lekar koi twit karne kii jehmat nahin uthaai
 The same can be said for Lockett Chatterjee
 bengal bijepi se jude ek insidar ne naam nahin kholane kii shart par bataaya, ‘ye sab aane vaale dinon main roy bengal main kya bhoomika nibhaate hai, us par nirbhar karegaa
 If they try to run things on their own, then the path will not prove to be easy for them
 ’roy kaa jab bhi naam liya jaataa he to jehan main khud-ba-khud philhal upi ke mantri or bengal ke purv party sanyojak siddharth nath singh kaa naam aa jaataa he
 Sometimes Singh's jumle from a field in Kolkata made a lot of headlines and that was 'bhaag Mukul Bhaag'
 do saal main kaaphi kuch badal chukaa he
 But one thing cannot be dismissed that it is not easy for many leaders to digest the entry of Mukul Rai in the BJP, both at the Center and in the state
 kyonki unhone bijepi ke ab ‘moolyawaan sadsy’ ban chuke inhen mukul roy ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke gambhir aaropon ko lekar jameen aasmaan ek kar diya tha

 neshnal congress party (ensipi) gujarat gandhinagar seat par amit shah ke khilaaf shankar singh waghela ko chunavi samar main utaarna chaahati he
 However, there is no seat sharing between the NCP and the Congress in Gujarat yet
 lekin raajnneetik galiyaaron main khabar he ki amit shah ke khilaaf ensipi se shankar singh waghela pratyaashee ho sakate hai
 It was Shankar Singh Vaghela who gave the Gandhinagar seat to the BJP in 1989

 In this Lok Sabha election, BJP President Amit Shah is contesting from Gandhinagar seat
 raajnneetik jaankaron kaa kahana he ki yah bhaajapa kii jiti hui seat he
 Because before this, whenever Advani fought from here, he won
 logon kaa maananaa he ki isi parampara ko barkaraar rakhte hue amit shah bhi yahaan se jeet jaaenge
 In such a situation, NCP wants to field Shankar Singh Vaghela
 kyonki ve gujarat ke kaddavar netaa rahe hai
 When Vaghela can get the Gandhinagar seat to the BJP, why not the NCP, the Gujarat NCP has put forward the demand to field Vaghela in front of Amit Shah
 ensipi yah maanati he ki jab 1989 main gandhinagar seat par jab koi bhaajapa ko jaanata bhi nahin tha, tab shankar singh waghela ne yah seat bhaajapa kii jholii main daali thi
 So this time he can get this seat to NCP also
 1991 main adwani ke liye waghela ne yah seat chhod di thi
 Since then it has been occupied by the BJP
 gandhinagar main thakor samudaay ke vot kheechenge shankar singh waghelagandhinagar loksabhaa kshetra main 7 vidhansabha siten hai

 At present, Congress does not have such a big leader who can fight against Amit Shah
 waghela ne pehle hi kah diya tha ki ve is baar chunaav nahin ladengeshankar singh waghela pehle hi yah ghoshnaa kar chuke hai ki ve is baar kaa loksabhaa chunaav nahin ladenge
 It is reported that if NCP chief Sharad Pawar convinces Shankar Singh Vaghela, he may be ready to contest elections

 pakistanmen aatankwaadiyon ke liye panaahagaah ko lekar pentagon ne chintaa vyakt kii he
 American experts said that the country's strategy for terrorist groups in India and Afghanistan has not changed
 pentagon ke press sachiv rier admiral jon kirbi ne ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, ‘pakistan main kai aatanki samooh lambey samay se panaah liye hue hai jo hamaare liye chintaa kaa vishay he
 For a long time it has been a topic of discussion with our Pakistanis
 ’ pentagon kaa yah bayaan videsh mantralay ke us bayaan ke kuch dinon ke baad saamne aayaa he, jisamen usne kaha tha ki vah pichley kuch saalon ke dauraan sansad ke aadeshaanusaar yah pramaan nahin de paaya he ki pakistan lashkar-e-taiyaba (eliti) or hakkaani network jaise aatankwaadi sagathanon ke khilaaf karrwai kar rahaa he

 - input language pichley maheene se smartphone fatne kii ghatnaon main badhotaree ai he
 Samsung's flagship is the Galaxy Note7 or the Galaxy S7 Edge
 haal ke dinon main in do smartphone ke alaava bhi kai smartphone ke fatne kii khabar ai he
 The Galaxy Note7 exploded in a vehicle, seeing that there was a bomb blast
 haalanki Note7 na to pehla smartphone naheenjisamen betry kii samasya he or na hi yah aakhirhai
 Such problems have come before and these cases will remain as long as Lithium-ion cells will be installed in the smartphone
 smartphone fatne ke zyaadaatar maamle charging ke dauraan hote hai
 But recent events suggest that they can burst anytime
 exparts kaa maananaa he ki aisa zyaadaatar maamle batriyon kii vajah se hote hai
 Know why Lithium batteries found in smartphonesmartphones usually explode due to these two reasons - getting hot and causing damage
 betry over hit yani zyada garm hone parazyaadaatar maamle betry garm ho kar fatne ke hi aate hai
 This happens due to some fault in the charging circuit and input power
 isamen betry garm hone par bhi charge hoti rahati he or thandhi nahin paati or fat yaa pigal jaati hai
 In such a situation, the user's hand may burn or the place where the phone is placed can also burn
 physical damejalithium batries kii khaasiyat yah hoti he ki vohalki hoti hai, inhen aasaani se charge kiyaja saktaa he or ye zyada output detii hai
 Obviously they are light, so the layer separating the electrode and it is also very weak
 agar yah unchai se gir jaaen to isamen short circuit kaa khatra bana rahata he or agar shot circuit hua to fatna laazmi he
 If you are using the charger of another smartphone for your phone, using the wrong charger and battery, then your battery will become hotter and its protection circuit may get damaged
 agar aapane third party betry kharidi he to yah bhi pareshaani kaa sabab ban saktaa he
 Constant charging material scientist Dansteingart of Priston University says that the battery is like a rubberband
 aap jab ise charge karte hai to rabar band kii tarah khinchati he or jab aap ise yuj karte hai yah relij hoti he
 Just as the rubber band breaks due to over-stretching, so much energy in the battery can ruin it
 jaahir he agar aap lagaataar betry ko charge karte rahenge to betry pigal sakati he
 In this way, protect yourself from the charger provided with the smartphone
 phone kii betry original khariden yaa sarvice centre se badalawaaen
 Do not keep your phone in a warm place during charging
 isse aapkaa phone or bhi garm ho jayega
 They become hot when the phone is used during charging
 isliye behatar hoga charge par laga kar kam se kam yuj karne kii koshish karen
 If the battery is less than 50 percent, then it is not wrong to charge it for charging
 raat bhar phone charge karne se parhez karen
 Although most smartphones stop charging at full charge, but it is better if you are careful after watching Samsung's recent events
 local power bank yuj karne se bachein
 Use a certified power bank of a good company
do not put weight on apane phone par vajan naa daalen or diarect sanlite main na rakhen

 netflix or amejan jaise madhyam par duniyabar ke audiyans krime joner vaale content ko kaaphi pasand kar rahe hai
 The web series is also dominated in India
 is madhyam ne bhartiya creatrs ke liye safalataa ke nae daravaaje khol die hai
 There have been several series recently on Crime and other different stories
 is kadi main amejan kii siries "mirzapur" bhi bahes talab he
 Some Indian web series were also highly appreciated
 khaskar netflix kii secred games, jisane duniyabar ke audiyans ko prabhavit kiya
 Masterbation scene in Mirzapur, Shweta Bolin - Why is the series as simple as drinking coffee? Actually, due to not being censored, stories are getting space in this medium
 is vajah se tamaam chijen jo ab tak filmon main sensord ho jaaya karti thim, unhen yahaan aasaani se cinemetic liberty ke saath dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 This style of showing things in originality is completely new to the Indian audience
 sensor niyamon kii vajah se aisa filmon or tivi main sambhav nahin he
 If you look at the Indian web series, a cocktail of crime, sex and violence seems to be selling well
 secred games, brid, last stories, insaide age, lav last and kanfusion jaisi tamaam siries main is cocktail ko bhunaakar darshakon ko prabhavit karne kii koshish hui
 They are being watched a lot
 par sachai yah bhi he ki aise content ko lekar tamaam vivaad bhi hue or logon ne is par pabandi lagane tak kii maang bhi kii he
 After the Sacred Games, there is an attempt to roast this cocktail in "mirzapur"
 mirzapur main vaayalence ke ansensord drishy behad khaufnak hai
 Watching the birds come out, shoot the bullet, bleed on the road and see the carcasses of flesh on the screen is very scary, but also a completely different experience
 thik isi tarah ansensord sexual seens ko lekar bhi web siries main svachhndatha dekhne ko mil rahi he
 It is another matter how important and meaningful it is to be shown in all the stories
 In Mirzapur too, there are many such scenes regarding sex and violence, which can be debated
 web siries main hatyaon ke tareeke khaufnak hai
 Sometimes the use of such scenes to show cruelty seems meaningless
 jaise kaaleen bhaiya ke suputr, munna treepathi kaa baar-baar raadhia ko raudna
 Ghazagamini's masterbation scene
 inhen dikhaaya janaa kitna sahi he?jabaki kaaleen bhaiya kii duusari patni binaa treepathi ko blackmel kar pairon se laachaar sasur jis tarah se "balaatkaar" karata he, vah siries kaa behad adbhut seen he
 a lot has been said in this by not showing all the things
 mirzapur main sikret package he kulbhushan kharbanda kii acting, baari hai ye 6 kirdaarahadein yaad rakhni hongi?abhi web siries par sensorship ko lekar bharat main filmkaaron ke paas bahut sari chhot hai
 They have to determine the extent and extent of this exemption
 kyonki secred games or last stories ke baad jis tarah se ek dhada isaki nigaraanee ke liye ek system banane kii maang kar rahaa he, vahaan sensorship se moulik rachanaatmakataa prabhavit hogi
 It is necessary to find a way to avoid the blind race of purposeless violence and sexual scenes
 sex or vaayalence ke seen filmaate vakt yah dhyaan rakhana zyada jaruri he ki aise seen kahani ke mood ke hisaab arthpurna bane rahe
 If the sheep were driven in the name of originality, then this medium would also be in danger
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ravivaar ko tanzania se kenya kii rajdhani nairobi pahunche
 This is the fourth and final stop of his visit to four African countries

 - The rites about which your ancestors came here, whatever may have been the reason, whatever may have happened, but you have made this place your own
 - aapke kandhe se kandhaa milakar yahaan ke naagarik vikaas main aapke yogadan ko sweekaar karte hai
 - The President of Kenya wanted me to come here in this calendar year itself
 ye unka or aapkaa haq he
 That is why i am here today
 - jab india-africa sambandhon ko majboot karne kii baat karte hai, to isamen duniya kii chintaa bhi hoti he
 - When the people of your earth suffer, then you must also be thinking
 aapako bhi pidaa hoti hogi- sarkaar ek videsh vibhaag chalaati he
 Who thinks that the world should be connected with India
 - bharat ke sachche ambesder duniyabar main faile bhartiya hai
 Indians have the power to connect the world
 iske pehle piem modi ne twitor par kaha, 'helo kenya! is mithravat desh aakar prafullit hua, jiske saath bharat kaa aitihaasik ghanishtha sambandh he
 'prior to this, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi visited Kenya in 1981
 unke baad in 35 saalon ke dauraan kisi bhartiya pradhanmantri kii is desh kii yah pehali yatra he
 PM Modi addressed the rally of Indian diaspora and conveyed his message to about 80 thousand people of Indian origin in Kenya
 unhone kaha ki duniya bhar main rahane vaala har bhartiya desh kaa brands ambesder he

 camoor paharipoon kii talahati main based satna jile main mandir ke liye mashhoor maihar madhya pradesh congress pramukh kamalnath ke liye party chunaav abhiyaan shuru karne kaa dilachasp vikalp tha
 He started a campaign from August 1 for possible assembly elections in November
 isi shahar se kamalnath ne 1998 main prachaar kii shuruyaat kii thi, jab congress sabhi vipareet paristhitiyon ko paar kar vijayi hui thi
 Recalling the same phase after the darshan at the Sharda Mata temple, Kamal Nath told a large number of people in the public meeting, "when i started the campaign with Maihar in 1998, Sharada Mata blessed the Congress with victory 
 ab koi kintu-parantu nahin he, congress aane vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi jeet hasil karegi
 "for the ninth time Lok Sabha MP, Kamal Nath will have to use all the political wisdom he has gained from his experience so far to compete with the BJP which has taken root in the state (in power for 15 years)
" or aisa karne ke liye isse behatar kya hoga ki viredhi ko khel main uski hi chaal se maat di jaae? 2 sitambar ko vidisha ke ganj basoda main jansabha main kamalnath ne vaada kiya ki agar congress satta main ai to har gram panchayat main goshaala banaai jaaegi
 He said, "BJP talks about cow protection but it did nothing
 gaayen roj sadakon par mar rahi hai
 Within four months of getting the new responsibility, Kamal Nath started with strengthening the organization, which is the main strength of the BJP
 63 jila congress cameti (disisi) main se 31 ke aise pramukhon ko hataa diya gaya jo niskriy the yaa "samasya khadi kar rahe the
 The rest has been clearly told to support the candidates
 kamalnath ne yah samajha he ki chunaav ke pehle or chunaav ke dauraan bhi block level ke netaaon kii party ke liye samarthan jutaney main kaaphi mahatvapurn bhoomika hogi isiilie unhone apane loksabhaa kshetra chhindwara ke 11 prashasnic khandon ko 120 uniton main vibhajit kar diya he
 However, due to short time, they cannot implement it in all 487 blocks of Madhya Pradesh
 kerala ke anubhavon se sabak lete hue do nae santhnik str-mandalam or sector kaa srijan kiya gaya he
 Many active Congress mlas and district committee heads have assured that at least one smartphone-equipped worker and 10 other activists will play the party's eye-ear at every booth on election day
 bhaajapa ke bahikhaate se congress ne ek or sikh lee he—vibhinn samudaayon ke pratinidhiyon se mulaakaat karne kii
 Like the Panchayats of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Ch 1 Han, which are organized according to community and profession, Kamal Nath is meeting representatives of various communities
 aise hi naveenatam prayaas main unhone 28 agast ko kushvaha samudaay ke pratinidhiyon se mulaakaat kii
 In the last four months, Kamal Nath has met with representatives of Yadav, Gurjar, Bohri, Vaishya, Lodhi, Sindhi, Patidar, Banjara and Balai communities
 unhone vaada kiya he ki congress party satta main ai to in samudaayon kii sabhi shikayaton kaa samaadhaan kiya jayega or unke hiton kii raksha kii jaaegi
 Under his leadership of just 100 days, the results have started showing at the Congress headquarters in Bhopal
 pradesh congress samiti main kamalnath ne semi-korporate style kii karypranali lagu kii he
 Printed details about the schedules of events and tours, strict schedules, lists and appointments etc
 are available
 kamalnath ne bhopal main abhootpurv 20 din bitaye, tikaton ke daavedaaron or party padaadhikariyon se mulaakaat kii or vidhansabha kshetron kaa vishleshan kiya
 The ticket contenders were asked what their winning strategy would be
 kamalnath ne khud hi logon se baat kar unki yogyata kaa andaja lagaaya, jabaki unke daftar ne tikat chaahane waalon or unke vidhansabha kshetra kaa byoraa uplabdh karaayaa tha
 He has also started public meetings, though the campaign will be duly started by Rahul Gandhi's roadshow in September
 dikhaava nahin chalegamadhya pradesh rajya congress ke netaaon ke prabhaav kshetra ke hisaab se banta hua he
 Jyotiraditya Scindia in gwalior-chambal region, Kamal Nath in Mahakaushal, Digvijay Singh in Malwa, Nimar and Bundelkhand and Leader of Opposition Ajay Singh in Baghelkhand
 pehle in netaaon ke prati nishtha rakhane vaale logon ko hi tikat milte the
 But if party sources are to be believed then this formula will no longer work
 congress agenciyon se karaae ja rahe kai survey par kaaphi had tak bharosa kar rahi he, jaisaa ki gujarat or karnataka main bhi kiya gaya tha
 This time the sample size of the survey has been increased from 5,000 voters to 15,000 in every assembly, so that a more accurate assessment can be made
 survey nateezon ke aadhaar par tay hoga ki antim ummidavaar koun hoga, na ki kisi netaa ke prati nishtha
 The Congress plans to distribute the tickets before the BJP
 jin 50 siton par party ko pichley paanch chunaavon main jeet nahin mili he, unamem pratyaashiyon kii ghoshnaa sitambar ke madhya main hi ho sakati he, jo ki party ke liye ek tarah kaa record hoga
 As of 2013, the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Ch1 Han was the main target of Congress attack on both shivraj-bjp
 yah koshish kii ja rahi thi ki vyapam or danpar ghotaalon ke mudde uthaakar unki chhavi kharaab kii jaae or avaidh baaluu khanan main unke parivaar ke sadasyon kii kathith bhagidaari ko ujagar kiya jaae
 But when the investigating agencies of the Center and the state could not find anything against Chauhan, then the benefit of this strategy started to be limited
 is baar congress ne rasta badal liya he or vah chouhan tathaa bhaajapa par sanyukt hamale kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 While Chauhan will be attacked for the failures of the administrative front, the BJP will be charged for corruption at the lower level of the government
 iske alaava, chunaavon ko sthaneey banane ke kamalnath ke lakshya ke anuroop congress ne vidhansabhavar masalon ko uthaane kii yojana banaai he or sthaneey ghapalon ko prachaarit kiya jayega taaki chouhan se dhyaan hataakar maujuuda bijepi vidhayakon ko bhi lapeta jaae
 Digvijay Factor: During his Jan Aashirwad Yatra, Chauhan is constantly targeting Digvijay Singh and reminding people how the state was allegedly in a state of disarray during his rule between 1993 and 2003
 is maamle main congress ke liye thodi mushkil he, kyonki vah digvijay se pallaa nahin jhaad sakati
 He is still very loyal in the Congress organization and the mlas
 iske alaava, digvijay singh ke kaarykaal main kai loklubhaavan kadam bhi uthaae gaye the, jaise kisaanon ko muft bijli, bill maafee aadi, jiskaa congress shrey bhi lenaa chaahati he
 However, the party would not like the election to be fought on the issue of BJP rule vs
 Digvijay's 10-year rule
 isi vajah se digvijay kaa jor party ke bheetar kaam karne par he
 He had taken out "ekta Yatra", in which he tried to bring all the factions of Congress together and vowed that first they should work to exclude the BJP, the differences will be resolved later
 congress apane prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan narendra modi ke 'gujarat model' kii tarj par vikaas ke "chhindwara model'' ke naare ko istemaal karne kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 Congress leaders are raising vigorously in public meetings how Kamal Nath, a nine-time MP from Chhindwara, transformed this tribal district into an industrially developed and prosperous district with his vision
 congress netaa matadaataaon ko kamalnath ke nehru-gandhi parivaar se judaav kii bhi yaad dilaa rahe hai, jinhen "indira gandhi kaa teesraa betaa'' tak kaha jaataa tha
 In this way, efforts are being made to add respect to the nehru-gandhi family
 sapa-basapa kaa saath majbootee degamedia main to aisi khabaron kii bharmaar he ki congress bahujan samaaj party (basapa) or samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke saath gathjod karne ja rahi he, kai khabaron main to un siton ke bare main bhi bataa diya gaya jo gathbandhan ke saathiyon ko mil sakati hai
 But top Congress leaders say that the coalition is far away
 vajah yah bataai ja rahi he ki basapa supremeo mayawati ne congress netaaon se kaha he ki ve gathbandhan ke swaroop ke bare main unke salaahkaar es
 C
 mishra se charchaa karen
 Although it is said that Rahul Gandhi has agreed to the alliance, but it will not be at the cost of harm to the party
 basapa zyaadaatar siten un ilaakon main maang rahi he, jahaan jyotiraditya sindhiya kaa asar he, jaise-ambah, dimani (jin par 2013 main basapa ko jeet mili thi), shyopur, sumauli, muraina, bhind (jin par basapa duusare sthaan par thi)
 She is seeking some seats in areas considered to be Ajay Singh's strongholds, such as Mangwan, Raigaon (in which the BSP won) and Rampur Baghelan, Semaria, Devtlab and Rewa (where she was in second place)
 ye donon netaa gathbandhan kii sambhaavna se bahut utsahit nahin honge, kyonki unke haath se ye siten chhin jaaengi
 Challenges ahead: There is a huge crowd at the Congress rallies, but the internal arrogance in the party is still a challenge
 july maheene main eisisi ke mahasachiv deepak babariyaa ke saath kathith taur par reva main congress kaaryakartaaon ne durvyavhaar kiya, jab unhone mukhyamantri ke sambhavit daavedaaron main ajay singh kaa naam nahin liya
 Rahul raised this issue among the top Congress leaders in Delhi and after that PCC fired six activists
 aise kai vaakye ho chuke hai
 However, at the bottom of the hill there is an arena near Sharada Mata temple in Maihar where, according to the legends, the famous medieval warriors Alha and Udal used to wrestle bets
 donon bhaaiyon ne ek yuddh main vir shaasha prithviraj chouhan se muqabla kiya tha, unki chandel sena jeet to nahin pai lekin usne chouhan ko kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaaya
 The political arena of Madhya Pradesh is also preparing itself for a similar historic electoral battle
 is jang main shaamil ek sena kaa netritv phir se ek chaihaan kar rahe hai
 Will the challengers in the modern era achieve this history momentum? You have to wait till November to know this

 On the last day of the Karnataka election campaign, Congress President Rahul Gandhi is an attacker on Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 pehle bangaleru main press conference ke jariye unhone PM par hamalaa bolaa or uske baad twit kar nishaanaa saadhaa
 Rahul wrote that the Prime Minister has not held a single press conference in the last four years, but i will keep doing it
 rahul ne twit kiya ki aaj bengalooru main press conference karne main kaaphi khushi hui
 i apologize to those who could not take questions
 lekin, hamaare pradhanmantri ne pichley chaar saal main ek bhi press conference nahin kii he, lekin main karata rahoonga

 koun banegaa karodpati ke is sijan ke pehle karmveer episod main sindhutai sapkaal hot seat par najar aaengi
 Many social workers have come on the KBC platform before this
 buudhvaar ke episod main sindhutai ke bare main thodi si clip dikhaai gai thi
 We are going to tell you who are Sindhutai who are going to be seen in the first Karmaveer episode of this season
 sindhutai anaath bacchon ke liye kaam karne vaali marathi kaaryakarta he
 Born in Pipri village in Wardha district, Maharashtra, Sindhutai's father was a shepherd and she was the most disliked child in her family
 unhen ghar main chinthi (fata hua kapadaa) kahkar bulaayaa jaataa tha
 The father wanted to teach them but the mother protested
 pita ne maa kii ichha ke viruddh unhen padhaayaa lekin ghar kii jimmedaariyon ke chalate unhen jald hi skool chhodana padaa
 At the age of 10, Sindhutai was married to 30-year-old Srihari Sapkal
 sindhutai kii nijee jindagi bahut dikkaton or pareshaaniyon se bhari rahi he
 He has devoted his entire life to orphans
 isiilie unhen maai yaa maa kahkar bulaayaa jaataa he
 She has adopted a total of 1050 children and is taking care of their upbringing
 sindhutai ko kul 276 puraskaron se sammanit kiya gaya he jisamen ahilyabai puraskaar samet raashtrapati dwaara diya gaya sammaan bhi shaamil hai
 She begged on the streets to feed the orphaned children
 It is also said that she was thrown out of the house when she was 9 months pregnant
 baad main jab unke pati 80 saal ke ho gaye to vah sindhutai ke anaathashram main rahane aae
 Sindhutai is said to have accepted him as a son
 isse pehle jitne bhi samajasevi sho par aae hai sabhi ne bhavuk kar dene vaali kahaniyaan sunai hai
 In the episode of Sindhutai, the audience will get to hear a lot
 akhil bhartiya akhaada parishad ne nasik kumbh snaan main daagi saadhuon par roak laga di he
 The ban has been imposed on two Mahamandaleswaras due to criminal charges
 swami sachchidanand or radhe maa par rokhkhada parishadne sadhu bane noida ke swami sachchidanand or mumbai se radhe maa ke akhaadon ko dono parnasik kumbhasnan kedauranrok lagane ke aadesh die hai, swami sachchidanand or radhe maa par aapraadhik aaropon kii vajah se roak lagaai gai he, akhaada parishad ne pratibandh sadhu-santon ke bich ghus aae aapraadhik logon ko hataane ke kaaran lagaaya gaya he
 Mahamandaleshwar has many criminal cases like cheating, land grabbing on Swami Sachchidanand alias Sachin Dutt, Dutt used to run real estate business in Noida with father Rajendra Kumar, who later went to Sadhuban, while Mumbai's Kandivali police station against Radhe Maa There are cases of dowry harassment and fraud with 6 people
 nae pyaar kii khumaari chadhati he to ladkiyaan apane lover se bahut kuch kahana chaahati hai
 All the emotions that roam in them, they want to share them immediately with their boyfriends
 lekin kai baar yah eemaandaaree bahut baari bhi padati he or vah aapke kareeb aane kii bajaay aapse dur bhaagane ke bahaane dhundne lagata he
 So remember that you do not have to say these four things at the beginning of a relationship - you look like my X
 No boy would want to hear that your x and he look alike, their habits are found, etc
 agar aapane use isi vajah se pasand kiya he toapaka rishta tikega nahinor aapaki in baton kii vajah se shaayad vah bahut jaldi hi aapse dur ho jaae
 Your friend's clothes are better than yours, and all your praise should be for him and if you already tell his friends better than him, then your relationship will only weaken
 ho saktaa he ki vah aapke saamne bas muskaraa de lekin andar hi andar bad rahiasuraksha kii bhaavanaage chalakar aap donon ke liye samasya khadi karegi
 What would you call our child's name, that you are floored on it, but what is the hurry to talk about marriage and children? ladke vaise bhi shaadi ke naam se aksar ghabaraate hi hai or aap jaldbaaji main us par shaadi kaa dabaav daalengi to vah paas aane kii bajaay dur hi bhaagega
 Your friends do not tolerate me
 You like him, but for you he will not want to leave his friends
 bhale hi unki aadaten dekhakar aapako chidh machati ho lekin apane rishte kii bhalaai ke liye is maamle main chup hi rahen
 If you are thinking that when other issues are discussed openly with him then why not on this, then note our point that you will spoil your relation yourself
