' Just before the Lok Sabha elections (lok Sabha Elections 2019), the politics of UP has once again warmed up and this time again the family of Mulayam Singh Yadav is at its center

 The last few days of the ICC World Cup-2015 have been quite exciting, as many great performances have been seen from the teams of well-known and weak and novice
 main haal ke aise hi ek match se shuruyaat karnaa chahta hum
 In November last year, during a visit to London in connection with his book Playing It My Way, a journalist questioned me about the England team's prospects in the World Cup
 maine apane jawaab main saaf-saaf kaha tha ki main england ko semifinal main pahunchane vaali chaar tiimon main nahin ginata hum
 My answer was based on the performance of England till then
 maine notice kiya tha ki england kii team main kuch aise mukhya yaa kendriya khiladinnon kaa sanket nahin he, jo vishwa cap main team kii takat ban saken
 It is no surprise that England has not been able to make a place in the Super Eight teams of this tournament
 isaki tulana main agar aap kuch behtareen pradarshan karne vaali tiimon—bharat, newjiland, srilanka or dakshin africa-ko dekhen to paaenge ki in sabhi tiimon main koi na koi mukhya yaa kendriya khilaadi jarur rahen hai, jiske irdagird baaki khilaadi apana yogadan dekar team ke behtareen pradarshan main madad kar rahe hai
 It is also a great thing that Bangladesh has reached the quarter-finals and Ireland also remains in that race
 yah usee baat ko doharaata he jo main baar-baar kah chukaa hum ki ubhartee tiimon ko apane khel ke str ko uthaane ke liye or zyada maukey die jane chahie
 The manner in which the Ireland team has taken the iron against established teams and shown the ability to chase big goals
 apane pool main paanch jeet or 100 fisadi record ke saath bharat kii form bani hui he
 Our team's strength has been its batting and with the top order players being in form, we have managed to do well in every match
 bhartiya team ne virdohi tiimon ke khilaaf bada score khadaa kiya he or lakshyon kaa peechha bhi badi aasaani se kiya he
 But i have been more impressed by the aggressive bowling of the Indian team, especially with fast bowling
 hamaare gendbaajon ne jarurat ke samay bahut acha pradarshan kiya he or unhone lagaataar paanch maichon main sabhi virdohi tiimon ko jis tarah ol out kiya he, vah kaabile tarif he
 The funniest thing in the match played against Ireland was that the early bowlers had not got any success and gave enough runs
 lekin tabhi ravichandran asina kii aguai main phiraki gendbaajon ne irish team ke ballebaajon par ankush lagane kaa faisla kiya or unke chakke chhudaa die
 Ireland, who scored 86 runs without losing any wicket, collapsed like cards
 vah apane nirdhaarit over bhi nahin khel sakaa
 This was possible only because of the collective strength of our bowling, otherwise they were smashed in the early overs
 is gendbaaji hamale kaa mahatvapurn paksh yah he ki vah virdohi team par lagaataar dabaav banaae rakhti he or ballebaaj ko uski kamajori main fansaana chaahati he
 The fast bowlers' camp is also bowling at a speed of around 140 kmph
 unhen phiraki gendbaajon kaa bhi puraa sahyog mil rahaa he
 These spin bowlers are becoming a big force in themselves
 aam taur par bhartiya team jab safalataa hasil karti he to team ke khilaadi hi mukhya rup se aakarshan kaa paatr banate hai jabaki parade ke peeche rahakar ranneeti banane waalon ko zyada shrey nahin diya jaataa
 There was a lot of criticism about the selection of the team and many types of questions were raised on the team management as to why such and such players were chosen
 But after the team's good performance, all the mouths are closed and nothing is being said in praise of those who have introduced the principle of consistency and patience
 australia daure ke samay aalochanaayen jhel chuke dhoni is samay tarif ke paatr ban gaye hai
 But not a single word has been written in praise of the way he bowed his head, faced criticism, sacrificed his father's duties and led his players through difficult times
 pakistan-dakshin africa or australia-srilanka ke muqablon main kuch shandaar pradarshan dekhne ko mili
 The way the Pakistan team performed in retaliation, the South African team clearly appeared in a panic
 bhartiya or pakistani tiimon kaa pradarshan apane ravaie main ek-duusare se bilkul vipareet rahaa he
 Despite this, both teams seem to be following the same approach as their earlier teams in 2003 (india) and 1992 (pakistan)
 apane pool main newjiland kaa sabase upar rahanaa koi tajjub kii baat nahin he, kyonki unke paas ek sugathit team he or unhen apane gharelu maidaanon par khilne kaa bhi phayda mil rahaa he
 On the other hand, Sri Lanka are getting the benefit of Kumar Sangakkara's brilliant game
 kisi vishwa cap main ek shatak lagaana bhi bahut badi uplabdhi hoti he, lekin sangakaara is vishwa cap main ab tak chaar shatak laga chuke hai
 By doing this, he has set a new world record not only in the World Cup, but also in the history of odis
 yah vishwaas karnaa mushkil he ki yah khilaadi is saal ke ant tak cricket ke sabhi sanskarnon se ritair ho jayega!kisi lambey toornament kii chunautiyon main ek badi chunauti yah he ki team kaa pichhlaa pradarshan nokout charan yani nchwarter final main koi myne nahin rakhata
 Teams like India and New Zealand, who have played so well in their respective pools, will now have to maintain the same performance in the quarter-finals
 bangladesh, pakistan or dakshin africa ab apni puri takat jhonk denge
 Your position in the league matches table looks good even before reaching the quarter-finals
 maidan main utarane ke baad yahi baat myne rakhegi ki us din koun-si team acha khel dikhaati he
 In this way, every team has an equal chance to go further

 ’ Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Friday once again reiterated his old declaration on prohibition
 darasal nitish kuch akhabaaron main chhapi un khabaron kaa khandan kar rahe the, jinamein yah daawa kiya gaya tha ki rajya main agle saal 1 april se keval desi sharaab par pratibandh lagegaa, na ki videshi sharaab kii kharid-bikri par
 Nitish said that authorities are currently studying in this regard, but it is certain that the ban will be imposed simultaneously
 rajya main sharaab ke pratibandh se kareeb 3500 karod ke rajasav ghate par unhone kaha ki pratibandh kii ghoshnaa se puure rajya kii mahilaon main jo khushi or utsaah he or sharaab pine se jis tarah janmaal kii kshati hoti he uske saamne koi bhi raashi bahut kam he
 The comments bihar ke mukhyamantri dwaara rajya main madhnishedh kii ghoshnaa kaa rajya ke vipakshi dalon samet mahila sanghathanon ne swaagat kiya he, lekin sabane yahi sawaal kiya he ki aakhir yah pratibandh kitna prabhavi ho paaegaa
 To this, Nitish said that in every investigation and study going on in this regard, every point is being taken care of
 unhone yah bhi mana ki koi ghoshnaa karnaa jitna aasaan hota he, use lagu karnaa utana hi kathin hota he
 It will be a big challenge to curb the smuggling of liquor, especially because it is not banned in the states adjacent to Bihar like Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Nepal
 nitish kumaar ke anusaar bihar main is sambandh main nai niti 1 april, 2016 ke pehle taiyaar ho jaaegi, lekin philhal unhone mana ki is vishay par jamkar atakalein lagaai jaaengi
 Nitish said that authorities are currently studying in this regard, but it is certain that the ban will be imposed simultaneously

 The declaration of prohibition in the state by the Chief Minister of Bihar has been welcomed by the women's organizations, including the opposition parties of the state, but everyone has questioned how effective this ban will be
 is par nitish ne kaha ki philhal is sambandh main jo bhi jaanch or adhyayan chal rahaa he usamen har bindu par dhyaan diya ja rahaa he
 He also believed that the easier it is to make a declaration, the harder it is to implement
 khaskar bihar se sate rajyon jaise jharkhand, uttarapradesh or nepal main is par pratibandh nahin hone ke kaaran sharaab kii taskari par ankush lagaana ek badi chunauti hoga
 According to Nitish Kumar, the new policy in this regard in Bihar will be ready before April 1, 2016, but at the moment he admitted that there will be a lot of speculation on this subject
 nitish kumaar ke anusaar bihar main is sambandh main nai niti 1 april, 2016 ke pehle taiyaar ho jaaegi, lekin philhal unhone mana ki is vishay par jamkar atakalein lagaai jaaengi

 Yes, banking kshetra main agle 5 se 10 saal main 20 lakh nai naukariyon ke avasar paidaa honge
 Yes, according to experts, with the issuance of new bank licenses and the efforts of the Reserve Bank and the government to provide financial services in rural areas, employment in the banking sector will increase
 ek or khaas baat yah he ki saarvajanik kshetra ke bainkon ke kareeb 50 fisadi karmchaaree agle kuch saal main ritair ho jaaenge
 Obviously, new people will be needed in such banks
 echaar ke kshetra main kaam karne vaali randstad india ke anusaar, banking kshetra main aagaamee dashak main 7 se 10 lakh naukariyaan paidaa hongi or 2014 main yah sabase zyada naukariyaan pradaan karne vaala kshetra hoga
 However, the Manipal Academy of Banking estimates that in the next five years only 18 to 20 lakh new jobs will be created in the banking sector
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki banking kshetra ke vistaar se jahaan pratyaksh rojgaar paidaa hoga, vahiin isse jude vibhinn kshetron main bhi nai naukariyaan paidaa hongi

 in bainkon main agle kuch saal main 5 se 7 lakh nai naukariyon ke avasar milenge
 In the public sector banks, around 50 per cent of the lower and mid-level employees will retire in this period

 'duusari ore, banking sevaaon ko gramin kshetron main pahunchane kii sarkaar kii vittiya samaveshi yojana se bhi nai naukariyaan paidaa hongi
 Uppaluri said, "only 30 per cent of the country's population has a bank account
 aise main bade bank aise gramin bazaaron main pahunchane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai jinka abhi dohan nahin hua he

 smartphone hamaari jindagi kaa atoot hissaa ban chuke hai
 If there is no smartphone in hand, then it seems that something very important has been missed
 har paanch-das minute main ekbar mobile dekh lenaa hamaari aadat or jarurat ban chuki he
 But this kind of use of the smartphone has the worst effect on our eyes
 agar aap bhi un logon main se hai jo ek din main 150 baar yaa usase adhik baar apane smartphone kii screen dekhte hai to aapaki ankhon ko isaki keemat chukaani pad sakati he
 For a long time, looking at the screen of mobile, tablet and laptop can cause eye irritation, fatigue and blurred vision
 iske alaava bahut adhik vakt screen par bitaane se ankhen suukh bhi jaati hai
 If you also have these problems related to the eyes, then these easy remedies can give you relief
 1
 Blinking of the eyelids for a while keeps the eyes moist and does not irritate
 2
 Put protector film on the screen of your smartphone
 aap chahen to anti-riflacting kot kaa bhi istemaal kar sakate hai
 3
 smartphone se brake len
 Even if it sounds strange to you, but it will be very beneficial for your eyes
 koshish karen ki har 20 minute main ekbar smartphone dekhen or sirf 20 second ke liye hi dekhen
 4
 apane smartphone kii britaness ko sahi se edjust karen
 The screen should neither be too bright nor too dark
 5
 The text size and contrast of your smartphone must be correct
 isse padhane main aasaani hogi or ankhon par kam jor padegaa
 6
 mobile kii screen ko hameshaa saaf rakhen
 Dirty screens make it difficult to focus and this can cause eye strain
 7
 It is very important to keep the smartphone at a reasonable distance
 smartphone ko 8 inch kii duuri par rakhkar hi kuch bhi tip karen yaa padhein

 " The Jodhpur High Court can pronounce its verdict on Monday in the 1998 Chinkara Shikar case
 salmaan kii nigaraanee yachika par yah faisla hona he ki seshan court kii paanch saal kaid kii sajaa barkaraar rahegi yaa phir abhinayta ko andeh kaa laabh milegaa
 During the hearing of the case, five such things have come to light, on which the court has acquitted Salman, showing seriousness
 1) chharre alag, chaaku bhi chhotapulice ko ummed bhawan main salmaan ke kamare kii talaashi main bandook kii goliyaan mili thim
 While the pellets found in the gypsies were not those tablets
 police nehiran kaa galaa retanevaala kathith chaaku baraamad kiya tha, lekin yah pocket chaaku he, jisase galaa retana mushkil hota he
 2) Separate report of Gypsy searchon department seized Salman Khan's gypsy and searched
 isaki search report main sirf khun ke dhabbe mili
 Later the police also searched the gypsy
 unhen gypsy main chharre, hiran ke bal mili, lekin van vibhaag ko ye chijen talaashi main nahin mili
 In this way, both search reports also became different
 3) sah-aaropee bari to salmaan doshi kaise?bhavaad or ghoda farm house ke mukademon main salmaan ke saath 12 aaropee the
 Of these, 10 received the benefit of doubt
 court ke saamne kuch aise sawaal hai, jin par gaur kiya jaae tosalman ko andeh kaa labhmil saktaa he
 How did a resident of Mumbai leave Umaid Palace for hunting? How did the deer meet here? Someone must have taken it? Why Salman is still an accused when the others are acquitted? 4) He has become the headmistress, Lalit Boda, the victim of drug dealer Arun, had filed the victim's case on the statement of Harish Dulani
 van vibhaag ne magistrate ke samaksh bayaan karvaa kar use choda tha, jabaki dephence kii ore se uskaa cross veriphication hi nahin hua
 He has since disappeared
 5) sajaa badhaane kii apil kyon?sarkaar ne salmaan khan kii ek saal kii sajaa ko kam mana
 Two appeals were made to extend the sentence of the prosecution and to consider Gordhan Singh as an accused again
 aise main sawaal ye he ki sarkaar ne duusare 11 log jo bari ho chuke, unhen gordhan kii tarah phir se aaropee banane kii apil kyon nahin kii? prosicution ke paas iskaa thos jawaab nahin tha

 The new draft proposal, distributed earlier this month among the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) member countries, may pave the way for India to become a member of this elite group, but will be until the completion of the term of the Obama administration next month is unlikely

 According to the Washington-based think tank Arms Control Association, the two-page draft offers nine such commitments that India and Pakistan countries will need to make in order to gain full membership

 india today ne oarji ke saath ek opinian pole ke jariye punjab ke 20 vidhansabha kshetron ke matadaataaon kii nabj tatolane kii koshish kii he
 The Opinion Poll asked people a wide range of questions
 jaise vartmaan sarkaar kaa pradarshan kaisaa rahaa tathaa mukhyamantri ke taur par koun he logon kii pehali pasand
 Regarding the performance of the Shiromani Akali Dal and bjp-led government in the state in the last five years, 32 per cent of the people believe that the performance of the government is average while 29 per cent consider the performance of the government to be poor
 maatr 25 fisadi logon kaa maananaa he ki sarkaar ne acha pradarshan kiya he or 19 pratishat log ye tay nahin kar paae ki wo sarkaar ko acha kahen yaa bura
 The second question was what was the biggest failure of the government? On this, 19 percent believe that the government has failed to curb corruption
 14 fisadi logon kii najar main vikaas kii kami jabaki 12 fisadi logon kii raay main berogari is sarkaar kii sabase badi naakaami rahi
 11 percent of the people also believe that the government abuses its power while the law and order situation is considered as the biggest failure of the government by 10 percent
 teesraa sawaal tha ki koun si party-gathbandhan behatar he jiske jawaab main 44 fisadi logon ne congress gathbandhan ko behatar mana he jabaki maatr 32 fisadi logon ne maujuud sattadhari bijepi-shiromani akali dal gathbandhan main vishwaas vyakt kiya he
 In this way, the Congress seems to get a big edge on the coalition front
 congress ko 2007 vidhansabha chunaav main 41 fisadi vot mili the jabaki 2009 ke loksabhaa main 45 fisadi ho gaya
 That means an increase of four percent while the Akali dal-bjp alliance got 45 percent votes in the 2007 assembly elections
 do saal baad loksabhaa chunaav main isamen ek fisadi kii giravat ai
 The bjp-akali alliance got 44 per cent of the votes in the Lok Sabha elections
 anya ke khate main 2007 main 14 fisadi vot gire the, jabaki loksabhaa chunaav main 11 fisadi gire
 According to the India today-org opinion poll, the Congress alliance could get 69 seats in this time elections while the current Shiromani Akali dal-bjp alliance is expected to get 40 seats
 is tarah congress gathbandhan ko 25 siton kaa phayda hota dikh rahaa he jabaki bijepi gathbandhan ko 27 siton kaa nuksaan
 The next question was, who do you want to see as the next Chief Minister? On this, 32 per cent people described Captain Amarinder Singh as their first choice while 29 per cent people considered Prakash Singh Badal as their choice
 14 fisadi log sukhbir singh badal ko aglaa mukhyamantri dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Overall, the trend seems to be in favor of the Congress

 unhone kaha, ‘‘agar aap log chaahate hai ki chayan samiti ke adhyaksh ke rup main isaki jimmedaari main luun to main iske liye taiyaar hum lekin kya isse samasya nipat jaaegi
 You have players who have scored 8000-10,000 runs in Test cricket and suddenly your top six batsmen fail simultaneously, then you cannot blame a person for this

 The source said that PM Modi can remove those ministers who have not performed as expected in the Bihar elections
 iske saath hi unhone bataaya ki party kii sheersh ikai or pradhanmantri un mantriyon par bhi karrwai kar sakate hai, jinhone gokshi or dadri kii ghatana par gairjimmedaarana bayaan die
 Let us tell you that five important ministers of the Center were camping in Bihar during the entire assembly elections
 inamen khaadya evam naagarik aapurti mantri ramvilas paswan or krishi mantri radhamohan singh bhi shaamil hai, jo ki daal ke bade daamon ko lekar desh bhar main mache vivaad ke bich bhi bihar main hi date rahe

 Let me tell you that this issue was also a big factor in Bihar elections and proved to be an important factor in mobilizing Muslim voters
 bijepi ne haalanki bihar chunavi ke in nateezon ko piem modi ke 18 maheenon ke kaarykaal kii raishumaari maanane se inkaar kar diya he, lekin kai log ise aisa hi maan rahe hai

 Input: IANS input: IANS Vinod Bhardwaj is quite clear, starting with Bharatendu Harishchandra, the father of modern Hindi poetry, it is not an easy task to choose young poets of today
 pichley dedh sau varshon ke itihaas main sampadak suresh salil kuch acchhee or pratinidhi kavitaaon kaa chayan karne main safal dikhte hai
 An important poet of today, Manglesh Dabral was preparing a selection of modern Hindi poetry for the National Book Trust
 kaaphi sangharsh ke baad ve bhoomika likhane main safal bhi ho gaye
 Perhaps he also gave the manuscript to the trust, but by then the time had changed
 ab us chayan kaa bhavishya andhere main he
 Suresh Salil is a scholar but his approach is more academic
 mangalesh dabraal kaa najariya gaiyr-academik he
 If their selection was also in front of us, then comparison of these two books would have been interesting
 varshon pehle paramanand shrivastav ne bhi sahitya academy ke liye samakaleen hindi kavita kaa ek acha sankalan taiyaar kiya tha
 Overall, Suresh Salil's selection would be good, but being the editor he should have avoided compiling eight poems of his own in this book
 mangalesh dabraal agar apane sampadit chayan main apni kavitaayen shaamil karen to vah taarkik he
 If hundred experts of Hindi are also asked to prepare such a selection, then Manglesh Dabral will be present among them
 par suresh salil ke bare main yah vishwaas ke saath nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Well, being an editor, he was able to exercise the freedom to include his poems
 hindi ke kai bade kaviyon kii kavitaaon main jo vividhta he, vah aise chayan main jarur saamne aani chahie
 But i could not find diversity in it with the poems of Shrikant Verma
 shrikant verma 'magadh' style kavitaaon se pehle 'maaya darpan' sangrah main ghar vaapasi jaisi adbhut kavitaayen likh chuke the
 But his later poems are more in this selection
 samakaleen kaviyon ne apane purvavarti khud khoje the
 Latin American writer Khorkhe Luis Vorces, in his short pithy essay on Kafka, wrote the important point that every writer produces his predecessor
 misaal ke liye, apane daur ke sabase bade kavi raghuveer sahay ne harivansh raay bachchan main apana puvavarti dekha-samajha
 He could not see his predecessor in Maithilisharan Gupta, Makhanlal Chaturvedi, Nirala, Jaishankar Prasad, Sumitranandan Pant or Mahadevi Varma
 ye sabhi apane vakt ke bade kavi the
 But Sahai found Bachchan close to him
 suresh salil ne bachchan kii praasangikta ko lekar apni bhoomika main raghuveer sahay or agyeya ko uddhrut bhi kiya he
 According to Sahay, "first of all, Bachchan made visions in place of invisible, reality in the place of abstraction and open sympathy in the place of gopan pain, and that too in colloquial language
 
 
 aaj ke saare kavyandolan isi bolchaal kii bhashaa ke boote chal rahe hai jiske pita bachchan hai—pant, niraala yaa prasad nahin
 "according to the unknowable," Bachchan's works completely destroyed the false belief of the reader of the Shadow Age that the language of the poem should be colloquially different
 yah maamuli kranti nahin thi
 In 1969, Liladhar Jagudi started a small magazine by creating a Hindi translation of Sumitranandan Pant's poems and created a ruckus
 unka kahana tha ki pant kii mul kavitaaon ko unki sanskritnishtha yaa saahitiyik bhashaa se alag kar diya jaae—bolchaal kii hindi main agar unhen roopantarit kar diya jaae, to ve akavita kii bhashaa or bimbon ke najadik najar aaengi
 It was nice reading relatively short familiar poems of many poets in this selection
 vidyavati 'kokil' kii kavita 'aaj raat shringaar karuungi' aisi hi kavita he
 In a suffocating environment, the poet wants to go to the colony and do 'poor business' by putting a haat of affection to love human beings
 isaki antim pankti he—'aaj madhur raagini ched sabakaa sona dushwaar karuungi
 Similarly, the relatively lesser known name Madhu Sharma (1961-2013) inspired by a painting of Amrita Shergill's poem 'lal Varamada' is also a pleasant discovery
 kisi bhi pratinidhi chayan main aap kaviyon kii mashhoor kavitaaon (misaal ke liye bhavani prasad mishra kii 'geet farosh' kavita) se alag kuch duusari kavitaaon ko paa lene kaa sukh mahasoos karnaa chaahate hai
 Such a selection occurs in this selection of 624 pages

 There is no doubt that the controversy that arose over the allocation of plots last week had all the spice to confuse the Nitish Kumar government
 lekin unki sarkaar ne na sirf is hamale ko beasar kar diya, balki usne vipaksh par hi nishaanaa saadh diya
 The controversy arose with allegations that the Bihar Industrial Area Development Authority (BIADA) had allotted plots to several people, including the daughters of two cabinet ministers and the son of a JD (U) MP
 ab vipakshi netaaon ke rishtedaaron, jinhone congress or rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ke shasankaal main bhukhand hasil kiye the, ke naam bhi saamne aa gaye hai
 The long-drawn opposition suddenly took an aggressive attack, alleging that Rehmat Fatima Amanullah, daughter of Social Welfare Minister Parveen Amanullah and IAS officer Afzal Amanullah, HRD Minister P
R
 ke
 Shahi's daughter Urvashi Shahi, and Rahul Kumar, son of JD (U) MP Jagdish Sharma, played a major role in the allocation of industrial plots
 shuru main is vivaad ne nitish sarkaar ko bachaav kii mudra main laa diya tha, lekin mukhyamantri ne turant hi bhukhndon ke aavanton kii jaanch kaa aadesh de diya
 The investigation report of Bihar Chief Secretary Anoop Mukherjee has denied allegations of bias and procedural irregularities in the allocation of plots
 haalanki vipaksh ne sibiai jaanch kii maang nahin chodi he
 Leader of the Opposition Abdul Bari Siddiqui said that the investigation report is only an attempt to crack the case so that those in power can be saved
 siddiqui ne yah bhi ishaara kiya ki vipaksh 'vyapak jaanch' ke liye patna hycourt ja saktaa he
 Not a section of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is opposed to the wider investigation
 use ummid he ki isse dheron dhaandhliyaan saamne aa jaaengi or vipaksh bachaav par utar aayega
 According to Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, BIADA plots were never auctioned except for one occasion in 2007, when the auction was made mandatory
 modi ne kaha, ''chaahe congress kaa shashan rahaa ho yaa rajd kaa, raajnneetikon ke rishtedaaron ko namakan ke aadhaar par bhukhand aavantit kiye gaye

 Shahi, Nationalist Congress Party leader Tariq Anwar, Lok Janshakti Party leader Mo
 shamsuddin or vijendra choudhary ke rishtedaaron yaa karibiyon ko bina nilaamee ke bhukhand die gaye hai
 Sources believe that some of the allocations will be difficult to defend, so a deeper investigation can be ordered
 baharhaal sarkaar ne bihar, jahaan udhyami pehle kaarobaar shuru karne se darate the, main project shuru karne ke liye udhyamiyon ko protsaahan dene ke makasad se bagaiyr-nilaamee vaale niyam kaa bachaav kiya he, lekin report is baat par khamosh he ki nilaamee se rajkosh ko zyada phayda ho saktaa tha
 The investigation report of the Chief Secretary has not examined the rationale of the first-come, first-served allocation policy
 is main kavval bhukhndon ke prakriyaagat niyamon ke paalan kii hi jaanch kii gai he
 Mukherjee's report is more focused on denying the allegations one by one and seems less well-researched
 report main pune ke simbiosis se emb 29 varshiya rahamat ke maamle kaa ullekh karte hue bataaya gaya he ki bhukhand ke aavanton main kisi tarah kaa pakshpaat nahin kiya gaya
 In January 2010, Rahmat quit BIADA to quit his job at Mahindra & Mahindra to start a business in Bihar, which, after examining his plan report and three interviews, gave him food-food in Bihia, about 80 km from Patna
 Allotted a plot of two acres to start the processing industry
 rahamat ne india today ko bataaya, ''mujhe apni pasand kaa kariyar shuru karne kaa puraa adhikaar he
 No one from my family background gets freedom to accuse me
 '' apni yogyata par ungali uthaane ke liye ek samachar channel ke khilaaf pehle hi manahani kaa maamla darj kar chukin rahamat apni yojana ko amali jama pehanaane ke liye kritasankalp hai

 He says, "all the facilities i had available in the Air Force, all those facilities have become available here at one place, i am also close to all my relatives and relatives in Ghaziabad

 The phase of highrise buildings started in Ghaziabad from Kaushambi from 1987-88 has now passed through Indirapuram, Vaishali, Vasundhara to the Crossing Republic and Rajnagar Extension

 K
 singh kehete hai, ''jameen aseemit nahin he
 We have to make best use of limited resources, so we have to go vertical
 lekin saath hi buniyadi suvidhaon ke liye dhanchaagat nirmaan bhi jaruri he
 "not only the shortage of land, its rising price has also forced builders and consumers to move towards highrise
 gaganchumbi imaaraton kaa nayaa thikaana bana crossing republic kul 360 acre kshetra main failaa he, jisamen 30 fisadi aria ko kaward rakhaa gaya he or baaki khulaa kshetra he
 Seven developers of the country Gaurasans, Esotech, Ajnara, Paramount, Panchsheel, Supertech and Mahagun have formed an association named Crossing Republic, which is working to settle this entire township
 crorsing republic ke chif oparating officer (sioo) ashok kumaar bataate hai, ''is kshetra kii yojana is tarah banaai gai he ki maatr 10 minute kii paidal duuri tay karne par logon ko shopping mal, aspataal, skool, park jaisi suvidhaayen mil jaaen

 philhal eei ne 93 meter kii oonchai kii anumati de rakhi he, jis par adhiktam 30 manzil imaarat khadi kii ja sakati he
 The tallest building in Ghaziabad so far is that of Panchsheel in this township, which is 25 storeys, while Supertech is building the tallest building of 30 floors nearby
 iske alaava isi kshetra main sevier builder ne 25 manzil ke nau tower ek saath taiyaar kiye hai
 Sanjay Rastogi, director of Sevier, says, "where there is no height limit and density is high, there is no alternative to high-rises
" ”hyrise ke badhate trend ke bare main rastogi bataate hai ki jab unhone indirapuram main chah or nau manzil kii imaarat banaai thi, tab unhen dar tha ki yah bikengi yaa nahin
 But now his crossing republic's 25-storey tower has also been completely sold out
 ve kehete hai, ''logon main ab hit phobia nahin rahaa
 Sandeep Gupta, director of Divya Angel Private Limited, which is building a multi-storeyed building in Rajnagar Extension, says, "with the coming of the expressway, the bridge over Hindon and the metro, this will be the focus area in NCR
 ” yahaan 10 se 20 manjila imaaraten aam logon ke ashiyane ke khwab ko puraa karne kaa kaam kar rahi hai
 The two-room flat here costs Rs 20-25 lakh
 main mil jaataa he
 New technology is used for the construction of a skyscraper and the cost of construction of the structure is high, leading to a higher cost of the flat
 isliye hyrise buildingon main flats kharidne vaale log mukhyat: madhyam varg or uske upar kii saamaajik-aarthik prishthbhumi vaale hai
 Since Ghaziabad is now cheaper in NCR than noida-gurgaon-delhi, youth working in IT and corporate sector in Noida are showing more interest in the skyscrapers of Ghaziabad
 dhai saal pehle yahaan flats kii keemat 1,800-2,000 ru
 Per square foot which was now Rs 3,500

 In future, the operation of the metro train from both sides will give new momentum to its development
 haalanki lokation is kshetra kii majbootee he to trephic jam kamajori

 Hotels are also ready to serve visitors in Prayagraj
 videshi sailaaniyon kaa phool maalaon se swaagat kiya jayega
 The President of the Prayagraj Hotel Owners Association, Rajendra Singh, says that all the hotels will give special facilities to their pilgrims and foreign tourists this time and they will be well received
 is baar kaa sangam main dubkee lagaana tirth yatriyon or sailaaniyon ko thodaa sa mahangaa pad saktaa he
 Due to Kumbh festival, all hotels and resorts in Prayagraj have increased their fares
 prayagraj ke kai hotalon main makar sankranti ke vakt hotalon main ek raat kii keemten 2 se 3 guna tak bad gai hai
 The Uttar Pradesh government is expecting that this time 12 million visitors will come to Prayagraj
 kumbh mahaparv shuru hone se pehle hi prayagraj ke hotalon ne manmarjee daam badaye hai, jisase aapaki jeb cat sakati he
 For example, for staying one night in Star Regency Hotel today, one has to pay 3000 and additional tax but during 13 to 14 January or Kumbh festival, one night rental in this hotel has reached 10 thousand rupees
 prayagraj ke milan pales main aaj kii taarikh main hotel ke jis kamare kii keemat ek raat ke liye 4
 5 thousand rupees, the same room rent 6 during Kumbh
 5 hajaar se bhi zyada hoga
 The price of a room for a night at Hotel Kanha Shyam is around five and a half thousand, but after January 10, the price of those rooms in the same hotel will reach 13 thousand
 star agency main bataur senior manager kaam kar rahe deepak kaa kahana he ki kumbh parv main is baar zyada tirthayatriyon ke aane kii sambhaavna ke chalate hotalon kii maang bad gai he, isliye unki keemten bhi bad rahi hai
 The Prayagraj Hotel Owners Association also believes that the price increase is inevitable given the mathematics of demand and supply
 haalanki association ke adhyaksh rajendra singh kaa kahana he ki kumbh ek tirth yatra he or aise main maukey kaa phayda uthaa kar manamaani keemat vasuulana galat he
 It is not that the administration is not aware of the arbitrariness of the hotel owners
 kumbh kii taiyaariyon ko lekar rose shashan or prashasan ke adhikari baith kar kar rahe hai jisamen kaarobaariyon or hotel vyavsaayiyon ke saath bhi baithkon kaa daur lagaataar prayagraj main chal rahaa he
 Suhas L
 Y
, District Magistrate of Prayagraj, says that this time for the first time in Prayagraj, the government has provided homestay-like facilities under the Bread and Bed Scheme and has also given license to many people to run homestays, so that more at a lower cost To provide better accommodation to more tourists and pilgrims
 prashasan ke mutabik, tirthayatriyon kii nishulk seva ke liye bhi door metry jaisi suvidhaon kaa prabandh kiya gaya he
 Most of the hotels in Prayagraj have been booked online by devotees visiting Kumbh since Makar Sankranti
 jaise-jaise maang bad rahi he keemten aasmaan chhu rahi hai
 On the online booking website, the price of hotels in Prayagraj is 3 to 4 times higher
 jaahir he is baar shraddha ke liye aapaki jeb par boj thodaa zyada padegaa

 bijepi mahasachiv ram madhav sahit tamaam netaaon ne navaj sharif ke bayaan ko betuka qaraar diya he
 Ram Madhav has even described Nawaz's speech as the worst speech ever
 ram madhav ne kaha ki navaj sharif ke bhaashan se saaf pataa lagata he ki bharat jopakistanke bare main kahata he vah sach he
 After this Ram Madhav said that the government should take strict steps on the attacks in Uri
 saath hi bharat ab pakistan ko ek aatanki desh ghoshit kar de
 He further said that nuclear weapons remain the biggest concern so far as Pakistan is a crafty country
 iske aage unhone kaha ki pakistani piem ne yuan main apane desh ke commander ke taur par nahin balki hijbul mujahiddeen ke commander ke taur par baat kii he
 'pakistan is making fun of itself' On the other hand, Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi blamed Bhinwaj Sharif's speech
 unhone kaha 'pakistan ko yah ehsaas tak nahin ki jab wo kuch bolta he to vah khud kaa majaak banaata he

 These people gave information to other people and in no time a large number of Congress leaders gathered there
 ek varisht police adhikari ne kaha, 'yah spasht he ki kuch shararti tatv maahaul ko kharaab karnaa chaahate the, lekin ham unki pahchaan karenge or kanoon kii praasangik dhaaraon ke tahat un par maamle darj karenge

 'the Grand Old Party' means Congress is in the loop
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main mahaz 44 siton par simat kar party ne apane itihaas kii sabase karaari haar darj kii
 The Congress entered the fray with great expectations for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, but the result was the same
 is chunaav main congress loksabhaa main sirf 8 siton kii badhotaree kar 52 ke aankade tak hi pahunch saki
 The biggest setback for the party was the defeat of Rahul Gandhi in Amethi, considered a stronghold of the Gandhi family
 wo to sudur kerala ke vynad ke votaron ne sthiti sambhaal lee or rahul ko loksabhaa main pahunchaa diya
 For the second time in a row, the seats of the Congress are not so much that it can get the post of Leader of the Opposition
 iske baavjood haar kaa manthan kar nai ranneeti ke saath utarane ke bajaay party abhi bhi apane andruni halaat se juujhati dikh rahi he
 If we start from the top, then the party president Rahul Gandhi has kept the party in the limelight
 party kii overol haar or khud amethi main apni shikast ke chalate rahul adhyaksh pad chhodane kaa man banaaye hue hai
 He has spoken of finding the president of the party outside the Gandhi family
 aise main kayaas lag rahe hai ki, loksabhaa main congress kaa netaa koun hoga? pichhali loksabhaa main netaa rahe mallikarjun khadge khud chunaav haar chuke hai
 In such a situation, Rahul's close people believe that Rahul can hold this post, but in case of not being president
 vahiin party ke tamaam netaa chaahate hai ki, rahul adhyaksh pad par bane rahen, phir wo chahen to loksabhaa main party ke netaa kaa pad len yaa naa len
 The effect of this uproar of the high command is also visible on the party across the country
 tamaam rajyon main aapasi gutbazi sataha par dikh rahi he, to kai rajyon main party ko sujh nahin rahaa ki aage kya kiya jaae
 The long-running feud between Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh and Navjot Singh Sidhu has now reached the Congress high command
 punjab main captain or siddhu ke bich khinchataan ko sulajhane kii zimmedaari ab party ke varisht netaa ahamed patel ko saunpi gai he
 During the Lok Sabha elections, the Uttar Pradesh Congress had entrusted the responsibility of Eastern Uttar Pradesh with Priyanka Gandhi as General Secretary
 lekin priyanka bhi upi main party ke liye koi kamaal nahin dikhaa sakin
 The fact that Priyanka was considered to be a trump card, frustrated the Congress workers also for not being able to make that bet
 priyanka pichley loksabhaa chunaavon main bina koi party main pad liye raibareli main sonia gandhi or amethi main rahul gandhi ke chunaav prachaar kii kaman sambhalati rahi thim
 He took charge of eastern UP as general secretary in this Lok Sabha election, but Amethi's seat also fell out of the hands if the results came
 sirf raibareli main sonia gandhi kii jeet se hi party ko santosh karnaa padaa
 Raj Babbar, the president of the Uttar Pradesh unit of the Congress, has been offering resignation for a long time
 jab priyanka ko purvi upi or jyotiraditya sindhiya ke pashchimi upi kaa prabharee banaaya gaya to pradesh main party ke 80 fisadi kaaryakarta pradesh adhyaksh pad se raaj babbar ko hataane kii maang kar rahe the
 He said that Raj Babbar can prove to be a better campaigner
 ab tamaam netaa sawaal uthaa rahe hai ki rajya bhar main congress sanghathan khastahal tha to pradesh adhyaksh ko lekar pehle kyon nahin cheta alaakaman
 He says that the state was not a person of the organization nor was it to understand the pulse of the entire state, as a result the state president himself had to face defeat in the elections
 tamaam netaa priyanka se kehane ko taiyaar hai ki, nai team banaakar, sanghathan majboot karke, gathjod kii ashanka ko bhi dur rakhte hue 2022 main bijepi se sidhe mukaable kii abhi se taiyaari shuru kii jaae
 In West Bengal, the Congress in West Bengal is unable to decide where it is
 kabhi mamata ke saath to kabhi left ke saath, kabhi akele
 Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary, who fought against Mamata, was removed from the post of president before the election
 haalanki choudhary khud apni seat se jitkar saansad ban gaye hai
 As far as being the main opposition party in the state is concerned, the BJP has taken possession of it by raising the flag of opposition Mamata
 congress ko samaj nahin aa rahaa ki pashchim bengal main koun si raah pakade jisase bhadralok main ek baar phir apana janaadhar majboot kiya ja sake
 In Odisha, on the lines of Odisha, Bengal, BJP has established itself as the main opposition party instead of Congress
 odisha main bhi congress mushkil main he ki kis dagar chale
 Congress has been marginalized in the battle of Naveen Patnaik's BJD and BJP
 pradesh main kaaryakartaaon or netaaon ko saath jode rakhane kaa sankat congress ke saamne he
 In Karnataka, Karnataka, in order to stop the BJP fighting the Janata Dal Secular (JDS), the Congress, despite being a big party, made an alliance by giving the Chief Minister's chair to the JDS
 karnataka main loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey bataa rahe hai ki ye gathjod modi kii lahar ke saamne beasar rahaa
 It was less then that many times MLA and senior leader of the party, Roshan Baig, is openly firing a verbal arrow against the party's general secretary KC Venugopal
 rajasthanrajasthan main beete saal disambar main vidhansabha chunaav ke baad congress kii sarkaar bani to party ne loksabhaa chunaav ko lekar bhi bahut ummiden paal leen
 But after the results of the Lok Sabha elections after five months, BJP won 25 of the 25 seats in the state and the Congress had to feel empty handed
 haalat kisi kharaab rahi ye isi se pataa chalata he ki mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ke bete tak ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 The quarrel between Gehlot and Deputy Chief minister-state President Sachin Pilot is not hidden from anyone
 chunaav baad payalat samarthak kuch vidhayakon ne to gahalot ko hataakar unako siem banane kii maang kar di
 The fact of the factionalism is that, the general secretary in charge of the state, Avinash Pandey, issued a press release instructing the party leaders not to make statements
 madhya pradeshmadhya pradesh kaa haal bhi kamobesh rajasthan jaisaa hi he
 The only difference is that in Rajasthan, Gehlot could not even win elections to his son, whereas the only Chhindwara seat with Kamal Nath's son could win Congress
 pradesh main party haalat itani kharaab rahi ki uske diggaj digvijay singh or jyotiraditya sindhiya bhi chunaav haar gaye
 The party lost 28 seats in 29 seats
 yahaan bhi kamalnath-digvijay banaam sindhiya kaa jhagada kisi se chipa nahin he
 In the meeting related to ticket distribution, the news of Diggi Raja and Scindia's Tu tu-main Main had also come in front of sonia-rahul
 chhattisgarhye teesraa rajya he jahaan chand maheenon pehle bampar bahumat se congress ne sarkaar banaai, lekin loksabhaa chunaav main party dhadaam ho gai, yahaan bhi pradesh adhyaksh or mukhyamantri bhupesh baghel netaaon ke nishane par hai
 In Bihar Bihar, the Congress was confident of crossing the Naiyya with the RJD and its allies, but almost everyone in the state was cleared
 party ke rajyasabha saansad akhilesh singh ke bete kaa sahyogi party ke tikat par chunaav ladanaa or haarana charchaa kaa vishay he
 At the same time, all the leaders of the state are in a mood of complaint about the inaction of the state president Madan Mohan Jha
 yani jab bhi alaakaman haar kii samiksha karegaa, aapasi bhidnt tay he
 Anyway, Jha's decision to keep Ashok Chaudhary with Nitish along with the minister and the state president for a long time was in dispute, which separated him from the Congress when Nitish split
 vaise ek tabaka ab ye maang bhi karne laga he ki, bihar main gathjod kii baisakhi chhod akele dam ladane or zamin banane kaa ye sahi vakt he
 Uttarakhand is also in the same situation with Congress
 purv mukhyamantri harish ravat seat badalakar bhi chunaav haar gaye
 The son of BJP leader and former CM BC Khanduri was given the ticket by giving preference to all the Congress leaders, he also lost the election
 party is parvatiy rajya main sabhi 5 siten haar gai
 In such a situation, there is a lot of hope for the organization
 himachal pradeshrase baad rajya ke diggaj congress netaa virbhadra singh yaa unke parivaar ke kisi sadsy ne chunaav nahin ladaa
 Virbhadra supporters were less active
 ulate party ne sukhram ke pote ko bhi ladaaya, jo chunaav haar gaye
 In this situation, factionalism in the party once again surfaced
 jharkhandyaha party ne jeemem or jeviem ke saath milakar chunaav ladaa
 The situation in the Lok Sabha elections was bad, so the leaders of the three parties are cursing each other
 congress pradesh adhyaksh ajoy kumaar pad chhodane kii peshkash kar chuke hai
 Himanta Biswa Sharma, who went from Congress to BJP in the Northeast, considers the party a major setback, due to which she is unable to recover
 himanta se muqabla karne ke liye tarun gogoi ab khaase bujurg ho chale hai, to vahiin unke bete gaurav saansad to ban gaye lekin himanta kii ranneeti se takaraane kaa anubhav abhi unke paas nahin he
 Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have a similar situation
 andhra main congress ke divangat siem wiesar rajasekhar reddy ke bete jagan mohan reddy kii wiesar congress party ne loksabhaa chunaav or vidhansabha chunaav main bampar jeet hasil kii
 In Telangana, TRS, the party of k Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR), overcame the anti-incumbency trend and won the first assembly elections and then the Lok Sabha elections
 telugana main bhi congress khastahal he
 Here, 12 of the 18 Congress mlas who won the assembly elections have given a further blow to the party by joining KCR
 kul milakar congress ko loksabhaa chunaav main kahin badi safalataa haath lagi to kerala he, jahaan bijepi kamazor he
 At the same time, the Congress also got a lot of benefit by going to the elections in Tamil Nadu as an ally of DMK
 tamilnadu main bhi bijepi kamazor he
 The Congress's success in Tamil Nadu owes less to the MK Stalin-led DMK
 isse saaf he ki alaakaman se lekar rajyon tak, desh kii sabase puraani party sankat se jujh rahi he
 But what she is doing to deal with it, it is not visible yet

 So he should be given a chance on his own soil before being brought on foreign tour as a regular captain

 sahitya or cinema donon ek-duusare ke purka sandip bhutoriyasb chalata he ke naam par ashuddh bhashaa kaa istemaal anuchitah ramadow
 Rama: Eminent writer and principal Dr
 Rama said in a seminar on 'entertainment and Literature' in 'sahitya Aaj Tak 2019', the biggest Mahakumbh of literature from today onwards
 Whether it is the language of literature or entertainment, the language should be dignified and should not hurt anyone's feelings
 bhashaa main hone vaali trutiyon ke prati laaparvaahee khatarnaak he
 Entertainment-literature complement each other: Sandeep Social and cultural activist and writer Sandeep Bhootoria said that entertainment and literature have a deep bond
 donon ek-duusare ke poorak hai
 The first medium of entertainment is film
 hindi filmon main sahitya kaa ahm role rahaa he
 The first Hindi film was Raja Harishchandra
 unhone aage kaha ki manoranjan kaa swaroop sahitya se judaa hua he
 It is not easy to find out which format affects entertainment and which form affects entertainment
 sandip bhutoria kaa kahana he ki buhat se log aise hai jinhen sahitya ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin hoti
 For him, literature is presented as entertainment through cinema
 bhaawanaaon ko thes nahin pahunchaae bhashaah doctor ramacinema main saahitiyik bhashaa kii garima par lekhika or dilli ke hansraj college kii principal doctor rama ne kaha ki sahitya kii bhashaa ho yaa manoranjan kii, donon hi jagah bhashaa garimamayi honi chahie
 The language should be such that it does not hurt anyone's feelings, does not sound loud, does not make fun of anyone and respect others
 unhone kaha ki bhashaa ke prayog ke prati jo saavdhaanee rakhni chahie wo ab nahin rakhi ja rahi
 The effect is that the younger generation is becoming careless towards it, which is very dangerous
 aaj ham sanskaar nahin de raheh ramalekhika rama ne do pidiyon ke bich vyavhaar ke antar par kaha ki aaj agar ham yuva peedi ko sanskaar nahin de paa rahe to yah yuva peedi kii galati nahin he
 The younger generation promotes the way in which they see and behave in the home
 agar ham apni peedi par najar daalen to us daur main har chizon par behad dhyaan diya jaataa tha
 Then we were taught to speak, read and write
 aaj kii peedi ke bare main unhone kaha ki aaj kii peedi tej gati vaali he
 She is moving at a fast pace and is leaving many things behind
 lekin hamen yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki bhashaa kii apni ek garima hoti he or hamen ise sanbhaalanaa chahie
 Dialogue is necessary instead of errors: Sandeep writer Sandeep Bhootoria said that there may be errors in the language, but the purpose of the language is to communicate
 kai desh aise hai jahaan angreji nahin samajhi jaati, aisi jagahon par ham aapas main samvaad sthapit karte hi hai
 It is necessary to communicate
 bharat main hi kai jagah hindi nahin samajhi jaati to bhi ham samvaad sthapit karte hi hai
 Dialogue is more important than focusing on errors
 bhashaa main vyakaran kii trutiyon par principal doctor rama ne kaha ki kai bhashaaen aisi hai jahaan vyakaran ke niyamon kaa paalan kiya janaa chahie, agar aisa nahin kiya gaya to arth kaa anarth ho saktaa he
 If it is just a matter of giving a message, then it is wrong to give a message by writing the wrong language
 saahitiyik bhashaa kisi ho, is par rama ne kaha ki saahitiyik bhashaa kathin hoti he
 Common language can also be literary language
 baari-bharkam bhashaa kaa istemaal lekhak apni vidwata dikhaane ke liye karte hai, lekin aam shabdon kaa istemaal kar saahitiyik rachana kii ja sakati he

 Many cinema was made on literature: On the status of literature in Sandeep films, Sandeep Bhooteria said that literature has been a major contributor in Hindi and regional films and many films have been made on literature
 devdas par har bhashaa main film bani he
 There was only one writer to write it, but many big actors worked on the subject
 hindi cinema main 4 bade actaron ne alag-alag daur main devdas film par kaam kiya

 com / lxpkzz3val New history will be made in Delhi this time
 dilli main agali sarkaar aam aadmi party kii hogi
 Both BJP and Congress will have to face defeat in this time elections
 ye daawa kiya he aam aadmi party ke netaa arvind kejariwal ne
 In Aaj Tak's Sidhi Baat program, Arvind Kejriwal said in the direct talk program that according to his internal survey, the Aam Aadmi Party is expected to get 45-50 seats in Delhi elections this time
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki log unki party or andolan ko vot daalenge
 Because today they have 1
25 lakh local incharge who are not with BJP and Congress
 kejariwal se jab poocha gaya ki is baar chunaavon main unki aam aadmi party kya keval siten kaatane kaa kaam karengi to unhone kaha- ‘congress ko lagata he ki ham bijepi kii siten kaatenge
 BJP feels that we will cut Congress seats
 asal main ham donon partiyon kii siten kaatenge
 Because people believe that no one in the Aam Aadmi Party is dishonest like the government
 koi sarkaar se darataa nahin he
 We did not fear even Robert Vadra and Anil Ambani
 aam aadmi party kii niyat saaf he naa ki sarkaar kii tarah karaab
 'there has been a lot of agitation but the government has not formed anyone till date, on this question, Arvind Kejriwal said,' i agree too, but this time something new will happen
 pichley do saalon main desh main bahut kuch nayaa hua he
 History will be made again this time
 aam aadmi party sarkaar banaaegi or vidhansabha main bhi baithegi
 'congress is accusing Kejriwal of bringing down the level of politics in the capital, to which Arvind Kejriwal said,' Ask the common man, he is saying that what we are saying is absolutely right
 kyonki sarkaar hi beyimaan he, aparaadhiyon ke saath mili hui he
 The government has failed to protect women
 agar hamaari sarkaar ai to ham sabase pehle dilli police ko sudhaarenge
 We will create a special commando force that can protect women and the elderly
 ye commando yuvaaon or cenier citijan main se liye jaaenge
 He will be supervised by the retired army officer
 ’shila dikshit ke khilaaf chunaav ladane ke elaan kii vajah par puche sawaal ke jawaab main kejariwal ne kaha, ‘raajnneeti meraa kariyar nahin, deshbhakti or bhrashtachar dur karne kii baat he
 Sheila Dixit has become a symbol of corruption in Delhi
 udhaaharan ke taur par bijli kaa nijeekaran karte vakt shila dikshit ne ye kaha ki tha bijli chori kam hogi or bijli chori kam hote hi ham bijli ke daam kam kar denge
 In 13 years, the theft of electricity has reduced, which we give them credit for, but even after stopping the theft of electricity, where did it go
 shila dikshit kahati hai ki anil ambani ko 2,000 karod kaa nuksaan ho gaya
 This is fake
 anil ambani ko dilli metro main thodaa sa nuksaan hua to wo metro chhodkar bhaag gaye or 2,000 karod ke nuksaan par wo vahiin baithe hai
 There should be an audit from the CAG, but on that too Sheela Dixit says that we are ready but the companies do not agree
 main poochna chahta hum ki mukhyamantri shila dikshit hai yaa anil ambani
 In response to a question, Kejriwal said, "nothing has developed in Delhi
" dilli kii janata dukhi he
 Except the Ring Road in Delhi, the rest of the roads are bad
 dillivaasiyon ko pani nahin miltaa
 Water comes in 15 days
 70,000 karod rupee seedbuji par phoonk die, lekin dilli main chaaron taraf kooda kachra padaa he
 Not only this, there is no water in Sheila Dixit's own assembly constituency
 ’kya aapako lagata he ki aap shila dikshit ko haraa paaenge, is sawaal par kejariwal ne kaha, ‘main kya, janata khud unhen haraa degi
 ' appal jald hi aapke liye laa rahaa he 'carplay'
 This American company has rebranded its ios
 appal car company pheraari, marcides banj, jaiguaar land rover jaisi gadiyon ke saath 'carplay' lekar aa rahi he
 Users using the iphone will also be able to make calls, use the map and view messages while driving through 'carplay'

 desh kii maujuuda siyasat main congress or bijepi- donon partiyaan gathbandhan ke sahare satta ke singhaasana par pahunchane kii kavayad main juty hai
 Coalition politics in the country started in 1977, but it was succeeded by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 vaajapeyi ne 24 dalon ko saath laakar rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan yani endie banaaya or paanch saal tak sarkaar chalaai
 Atal's achievement was also special because no coalition government had completed his five-year term before him
 1998 main endie kaa gathotal bihari vaajapeyi ne bijepi ko shunya se shikhar tak pahunchane ke kaam kiya he
 NDA was formed in May 1998 under the leadership of BJP
 gaiyr- congressi sarkaar ke gathan ke disha main ye pehla kadam tha
 However, the alliance was broken in a year, when Jayalalitha withdrew support
 iske baad 1999 main atal bihari vaajapeyi ne kuch nae dalon ke saath milakar gathbandhan banaaya or pradhanmantri bane
 This time the NDA consisted of about 24 parties and ran the government for five years
 haalanki, 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main endie ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 The Congress adopted the path of Congress Vajpayee's alliance on the bjp's path
 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sonia gandhi ne kai dalon ke saath milakar congress ke netritv main sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (upie) gathan kiya
 Under the leadership of the Congress, the UPA sat on the power of the country for ten years, but in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi had to face a crushing defeat in the wave
 ab ek baar phir desh main congress ke netritv main mahagathbandhan ban rahaa he, jisamen haal hi main endie kaa saath chhodkar aae upendra kushvaha kii party araspi or andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu kii party tidipi shaamil hui hai
 On the other hand, in the bjp-led NDA, the party president Amit Shah is engaged in keeping the allies together
 haalanki, vaajapeyi ke daur main bijepi ke netritv vaale endie kii kaman hameshaa sahyogi dalon ke paas rahi he
 The NDA convenor was first handled by leaders like George Fernandez, then Sharad Yadav and Chandrababu Naidu
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki endie kii sarkaar paanch saal safaltaapurvak chali

 On his journey to acting, he reached Mumbai via Lucknow, Delhi
 enesdy isamen ek mahatvapurn padaav tha, jahaan abhinay kii baarikiyaan sikhin
 Describing the experience of learning, he said that 'I used to find boring subjects apart from acting

 lekin baad main bhi main vahi purana vaala suut pahanakar gaya'
 An audience also mentioned that Nawaz's film 'raman Raghav 2
 0’ ko dekhne ke liye kaan main lambii line lagi thi
 Nawaz's co-actor and teacher in the short film 'bypass', Suryamohan Kulshrestha asked how much he misses 'bypass'? So Nawaz said that 'bypass' was the film which he could show and ask for work
 sangharsh se ub kar kuch or chunane ke sawaal par nawaz kaa jawaab tha 'main ye field kaise chodta, jab mujhe or kuch aata hi nahin he
 When asked about the theater, he told Babaki that 'he has been away from the theater for a long time, so he does not know much about the present theater
 lekin rangamanch karnaa chaahate hai
 They have films for two years, after which they can do their work
 ant main enesdy nideshak vaaman kendre ne unase enesdy ke chaatro ke bich aakar unhen sikhaane kaa vaada liya
 On this occasion, the audience, teachers, students of NSD asked Nawaz a lot of questions about his acting, struggle and plans ahead
 'gang of vasepur' ke faisal khan ne baari-baari se sabakaa jawaab diya
 Nawaz had decided to become an actor by reading Naseeruddin Shah's interviews in Mayapuri
 abhinay kii yatra main lakhanu, dilli hote hue mumbai tak pahunche
 NSD was an important stop in this, where the nuances of acting were learned
 seekhney ke anubhav ko bataate hue kaha ki 'mujhe acting ke alaava saare subject bahut boring lagate the
 Stage-craft seemed to be the most boring and Yoga was the best because it could sleep
 ' enesdy kii training se mila aatmavishvaas nawaz ke aage kaam aayaa
 'the theater has always instilled confidence in me
 jab mere bure din the or main cinema ke liye sangharsh kar rahaa tha, tab bhi mujhe rashtriya natya vidhyalay (enesdy) se hi takat milti thi
 Recalling his days of struggle, Nawaz said that when i went to Mumbai after passing out from NSD, i used to get only one scene in all the films for five-six years
 in seens main main zyaadaatar peeta jaataa tha
 i am from NSD, a trend actor
 isse unhen koi fark nahin padataa tha
 Then i started to get two scenes and then came the year 2012 and my four films 'gangs of Wasseypur' (1 and 2, 'kahaani' and Talaash
 'gangs of vasepur' ke aakhri seen main saat-aath sau goliyaan chalaakar maine apane in bure dinon kii bhadaas nikaali
 Comments or jab kamayabi mili to apane liye dusron ke badlaav ko bhi mahasoos kiya
 Before 'gangs of Wasseypur', no teller from Mumbai was ready to sew my suit
 unhen yakeen hi nahin hota tha ki meri film kaan main ja sakati he
 i sewed a suit to go there with great difficulty
 baad main kai dijainer mere aage-peeche ghoomane lage
 But later on i went wearing the same old suit
 ek darshak ne zikr bhi kiya ki nawaz kii film ‘raman raghav 2
 There was a long line in the ear to see 0 '
 shortfilm ‘bypass’ main nawaz ke sah abhinayta or shikshak rahe suryamohan kulshreshth ne poocha ki ‘bypass’ ko kitna yaad karte hai? to nawaz ne kaha ki 'bypass'hi wo film thi jise dikhaakar wo kaam maang sakate the
 Nawaz's answer to the question of choosing something else, bored with the struggle, was' How would i leave this field, when i don't know anything else
 ' rangamanch ke bare main poochne par unhone bebaaki se kaha ki 've bahut dinon se rangamanch se dur hai isliye ve abhi ke rangamanch ke bare main zyada nahin jaanate
 But want to do theater
 do saalon tak unke paas filmein hai uske baad ve rangakarm kar sakate hai'
 In the end, NSD Director Vaman Kendre promised him to come and teach him among the students of NSD
 nawaz ne mayapuri main nasiruddin shah kaa intervy padhakar actor banane kaa faisla kiya tha
 On his journey to acting, he reached Mumbai via Lucknow, Delhi
 enesdy isamen ek mahatvapurn padaav tha, jahaan abhinay kii baarikiyaan sikhin
 Describing the experience of learning, he said that 'I used to find boring subjects apart from acting
 stage-craft sabase boring lagata tha or yoga sabase acha kyonki usamen soya ja saktaa tha'
 The confidence gained from NSD training came in front of Nawaz
 'theatre ne hameshaa mere andar aatmavishvaas kaa sanchaar kiya he
 When i had bad days and i was struggling for cinema, i still got strength from the National School of Drama (NSD)
 apane sangharsh ke dinon ko yaad karte hue nawaz ne kaha ki 'enesdy se passout hone ke baad jab main mumbai gaya to mujhe paanch-chah saal tak sari filmon main keval ek-ek seen milte rahe
 i was mostly beaten in these scenes

 ishkbaaj ke 7 march ke episod main pinki anika se kahati he ki vah store room se nariyal le aae
 Daksha meets her outside the store room and then as Anika enters the store room, the door is locked from inside
 isse anika ko daksh ke pehle kaa torchar yaad aata he or vah dar jaati he
 Then Shivaay comes there and says that he is with her, there is no need to fear her
 vah kahata he ki priyanka kii shaadi tak unhen daksh ko jhelana hoga or uske baad agar vah anika ko pareshaan karegaa to vah uski jaan le legaa
 Anika asks him why he will kill someone for her, so Shivaay stops once again saying that she is his wife
 vah kahata he anika jaanati he ki vah uske liye kya he, vah kahata he ki vah uske liye bahut mahatvapurn he
 Anika and Shivaay arrive in the hall for the stopped ritual
 yahaan daksh ko dekh anika saham jaati he par shivaay use sambhalata he
 Kamini says that the pausing ritual begins by feeding the bride five kinds of fruits
 vah ranvir se kahati he ki vah priyanka ko sabase pehle papeeta khilaae
 Shivaay says that what is the need of feeding papaya, Pinky interrupts him that the fruit is there, what is the problem in eating it
 ranvir priyanka ko fal khilaa rahaa hota he itane main shivaay falon kaa trey gira detaa he
 He says that there was an ant in the fruit so he did it
 iske baad ranvir or priyanka ek duusare ko mithai khilaate hai
 Then Ranveer's call comes and he goes out
 baahar shivaay ranvir ko daantata he ki usne kaha tha ki vah priyanka kaa khyaal rakhega lekin ab use is bare main dobaaraa sochna padegaa
 When Ranveer does not understand Shivaay, Shivaay says that he does not eat papaya in pregnancy and he was feeding papaya to Priyanka with his hands
 vah kahata he ki is bare main un teenon ke alaava kisi ko kuch nahin pataa he or vah koshish karegaa ki jald se jald un donon kii shaadi ho jaae
 Daksha listens to the three of them and plans that he will take advantage of Shivaay's weakness and make him dance at his fingertips
 ishkbaaj main shivaay ne di anika ko himmat
 The comments der raat anika sapane main dekhati he ki daksh ne use rassi se baandhakar rakhaa he or use tub main daalkar pani main dubaakar maarane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Anika starts screaming in a dream and opens her sleep with fear
 anika ko dekh shivaay use samajhaata he ki daksh vahaan nahin he or vah uske saath he
 He tells Anika that he is an overbearing Anika and must face her fears
 vah kahata he ki daksh uskaa kuch nahin bigaad paaegaa
 Anika then pinky-promises Shivaay that she will face her fears
 anika shivaay se kahati he ki daksh bahut chaalaak he, vah kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 She says that due to Daksha she has been away from him earlier, Shivaay says that earlier both of them were separate but now both are one and when both are together then will Daksha not spoil the whole world
 Can
 anika or shivaay roke kii rasm ke liye haul main pahunchate hai
 Here Anika agrees to see Daksha, but Shivaay manages her
 kamini kahati he ki roke kii rasm dulhan ko paanch tarah ke fal khilaane se shuru hoti he
 She asks Ranveer to first feed Papaya to Priyanka
 shivaay kahata he ki papeeta khilaane kii kya jarurat he is par pinki use tok detii he ki fal hi to he, khaane main kya problem he
 While Ranveer is feeding fruit to Priyanka, Shivaay drops a tray of fruits
 vah kahata he ki falon main cheentee thi isliye usne aisa kiya
 After this, Ranveer and Priyanka feed each other sweets
 tabhi ranvir kaa phone aata he or vah baahar chalaa jaataa he
 Shivaay outside scolds Ranveer that he said that he will take care of Priyanka but now he will have to think again about this
 ranvir ko shivaay kii baat samaj main nahin aati to shivaay kahata he ki pregnancy main papeeta nahin khate hai or vah apane haathon se priyanka ko papeeta khilaa rahaa tha
 He says that nobody knows anything about this other than the three of them and he will try to get them married as soon as possible
 daksh un teenon kii baat sun letaa he or plan karata he ki vah shivaay kii is kamajori kaa phayda uthayega or use apni ungaliyon par nachaayegaa
 Shivaay gave courage to Anika in flirtation
 tippaniyan Late in the night, Anika dreams that Daksha has tied her with a rope and is trying to kill her by putting her in a tub and dipping it in water
 anika sapane main cheekhney lagati he or dar se uski neend khul jaati he
 Seeing Anika, Shivaay explains to her that Daksha is not there and she is with him
 vah anika se kahata he ki vah dabang anika he or use apane dar kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 He says that Daksha will not spoil him
 iske baad anika shivaay se pinki-promis karti he ki vah apane dar kaa saamana karegi
 Anika tells Shivaay that Daksha is very clever, he can do anything
 vah kahati he ki daksh kii vajah se vah pehle bhi usase dur ho chuki he, is par shivaay kahata he pehle wo donon alag the lekin ab donon ek ho chuke hai or jab donon saath hai to daksh kya puri duniya un donon kaa kuch nahin bigaad sakati he

 The suicide note of this student has become viral on social media
 isamen usne likhaa he ki usne pehle bhi ek baar khudakushi kii koshish kii thi
 In both cases, he has attributed the same institute to his step
 apane suicide note main chaatra ne likhaa he, 'agar aap esarftai kii chaatra hai or aapke saath yon utpeedan or balaatkaar hota he, to aapke paas jeene kaa koi rasta nahin bachataa
 i tried my best to stay alive
 
 
 lekin ek mahila apni jindagi kii door baandhe rakhane ke liye itnaa hi kar sakati he
 In the conversation with India Today, the student said that she had given a complaint in December 2015 to the Internal Committee (ICC-SH) to look into complaints related to sexual harassment against two professors and two students of the institute
 chaatra kaa kahana he ki aantarik samiti ne ek professor ko doshi bhi paaya lekin uske khilaaf ab tak koi karrwai nahin kii gai
 At the same time as far as the students accused of sexual harassment are concerned, the student says that the film institute violated the laws in this case
 uskaa kahana he, 'unhone chaatro ke khilaaf shikaayat kii jaanch ke liye ek anya samiti gathit kar di, jabik kisi santhaan ko bas ek hi aantarik samiti rakhane kii anumati he
 'the student also alleges that he tried to get her signed on a paper in which she had written such things which she never said

 New research has confirmed that open joking is not only good for health, but it also improves youth
 jo log khushmijaaj hote hai, unki sexual life auron se behatar hoti he
 The same formula applies to women

 Aishwarya has changed so much in 2 years, the glamorous look Aishwarya Rai was seen in 'fanne Khan' in the 2016 super hit film 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil'
 movie main ve lambey arase baad glamras luk main dikhi thim

 The trailer of the film is out

 Instead of a film, Bollywood stars get such a thick fee, Bollywood stars make a difference in their salary according to their popularity and their gender gap, but do you know how big this gap is? At present, Akshay Kumar is the star of the highest number of films in a year, while Deepika Padukone is the highest paid actress of Bollywood
 padmavat main deepika ko 12 karod rupee fees mili thi jo ki ranvir singh or shahid kapur se kahin zyada thi
 We are going to tell you today that this director, impressed by Sanju about the fees of Bollywood superstars and their demand in public, wants to make a biopic on Kapil after watching Sanjay Dutt's biopic Sanju Vinod Tiwari, director of Teri Bhabhi Hai Pagle, comedian- The actor wants to make a film on Kapil Sharma

 Mayawati got relief from the Supreme Court in the disproportionate assets case, saying that there was no need for the CBI to file an additional FIR
 court ne yah bhi kaha he ki yah sahi nahin tha jis tarah se is maamle main sibiai ne maamla chalaaya or FIR darj kii
 This was done out of jurisdiction by the agency and was completely illegal
 baharhaal, mayawati par taj coridor maamle main kareeb 17 hajaar karod kii dhaandhlee lambit he
 The opposition says that the court has decided not on Mayawati's income case but on the working style of CBI
 bispi kaa kahana he ki yah mayawati kii jeet hui he
 His wealth increased from 1 crore in 2003 to 50 crore in 2007
 unhone ek-ek paise kaa byora jo unako kaayakarta ne diya uski jaankaree tex departpent ko de di he to phir yah sawaal he ki yah maamla phir itane saal tak kyon chalaa
 Till September last year, CBI had said that Mayawati and her relatives are committing a criminal nexus, then what was the evidence of today
 aalochakon kaa kahana he ki kya raashtrapati chunaavon main mil rahe bispi ke samarthan ke kaaran sibiai kaa cese kamjor rahaa
 Today once again the Center is accused of using the CBI
 aisa kaise ki andhra pradesh main congress se baghawat karne vaale jagan mohan reddy par aay se adhik sampatti kaa maamla salbhar main nibat jaataa he or vah jail bhi chale jate hai
 Within a year, property investigation, case registration, charge sheet and jail take place



 sibiai jaldi hi unke bank khate fries kar detii he lekin spectrum maamle main diemke ke kalaiganor tivi ke khaaton ko lekar sibiai aage nahin badhati he
 How is it that Samajwadi Party's Mulayam Singh Yadav and family's disproportionate assets case has been going on for 12 years but when the central government needs the party's mps, the cbi's attitude seems weak, even in 2008 During the nuclear deal, sp's 36 mps are needed or now in the presidential election
 shaayad aaj ek baar phir raajnneeti main bhrashtachar, chunaav sudhaar or swatantra sibiai par gaur kii zarurat he

 aam jindagi kii khushi gam main badal jaati he or nam aakhon se jabanjon ko salaami di jaati he
 But on the other hand, the news of the death of eight jawans standing on the Naxal front in Chhattisgarh in the last one month is hardly noticed
 naksal morche se taaja jaankaree yah he ki suraksha bal ke jawan in dinon dehshat main hai
 This Dashahat is neither of the Naxalites nor of the bullets emanating from their guns
 darasal, morcha sambhaal rahe adhiktar jawan malaria ke shikaar ho gaye hai
 The disease has killed eight soldiers
 khauf aisa ki do hajaar se zyada javaanon ne chuttee kii arji aage badha di he
 But malfeasance is sitting on the feet and the soldiers in the hospital are neither receiving medicines nor other facilities at the right time
 chhattisgarh main bastar se lekar raipur tak sarkari or gaiyr sarkari aspataal main in dinon aam marijon kii bajaay police or kendriya suraksha balon ke javaanon kii bhartiyon ho rahi hai
 These are especially filled with malaria-prone young people
 in javaanon kii tainaati bastar, dantewada, bijapur, sukama or andhra pradesh, maharashtra or orissa kii sarhad par he
 Most of the jawans have been admitted after complaining of meningitis
 vyavastha khasta haalat main he or malaria se peedit javaanon kii na to samay par khun jaanch hui he or na hi koi dawa hi mili he
 The young people who are healthy are busy taking their friends to the hospital
 doctoron kaa kahana he ki samay par javaanon ko chikitsa suvidha muhaiyaa ho jaae to malaria ko mastishk fever tak pahunchane se pehle roka ja saktaa he
 Dr
 of Maharani Hospital sanjay basak kehete hai, 'medical college main javaanon ko malaria sambandhi treetment or medical suvidha dene kaa prayaas rahata he
 South Bastar is a Naxalite region
 ye durgam ilaaka he or vaahan se javaanon ko nikaalte-laate kaaphi der ho jaati he
 This causes the brain to spread malaria
 'yahaan goliyon ne nahin, beemaari ne lee jaanajavaanon ke liye suraksha main shahid hona garv kii baat hoti he, lekin chhattisgarh main naksal morche main date javaanon kii jaan beemaari le rahi he
 Eight jawans have died in a month due to persistent fever
 do hajaar se zyada javaanon kaa ilaaj kiya ja rahaa he
 It is also sad that no one is going to discuss the death of malaria affected soldiers
 afasar raaton-raat javaanon ke shav ko unke grih nagar ravaanaa kar dete hai
 On the other hand, from security forces posts to barracks, the forest rule of mosquitoes continues
 lagaataar barish se machharon kii paidaavaar bhi khub ho rahi he
 In addition to this discipline, jawans are also complaining of allergies due to coming in contact with the leaves of many trees and plants within the forest
 anushaasan ke danda tale sahame jawan, bimariyon se ladane ke maamle main apana munh kholane se batch rahe hai
 According to sources, the barracks are full of malaria kits
 barish main mausam kii maar or khaane-pine kii vastuon main giravat hyper acidity ko nimantran detii he
 Alam is that the soldiers are afraid to patrol the forest in fear
 2000 javaanon ne chuttee kii arji de rakhi he, jinpar sunwaayee na ke baraabar he
 However, some applications are also being considered after consulting doctors
 javaanon ke swasthya kaa jayja lene ke liye na to chhattisgarh police mukhyalay main sakriyata he or na hi kendriya suraksha balon ke aalaa afasar hi is ore koi utsukata dikhaa rahe hai
 RG Vij, the ADG of the Chhattisgarh CAF, says, "our units are police stations or posts everywhere
 vahaan firsted kit di jaati he, lekin iske alaava yadi kahin par malaria yaa duusari samasya aati he to doctoron kii team bhej kar ilaaj karavaaya jaataa he
 Where necessary, a team of district headquarters will be formed and treated
 ' CBI director Ranjit Sinha, who spoke about enjoying the rape, regretted his statement
 unhone kaha ki asaavadhaaneevash unhone aisa kah diya, unka makasad kisi kii bhavanaaen aahat karnaa nahin tha
 It is worth mentioning that in a CBI program on Tuesday, Ranjit Sinha had advocated the legalization of sports betting and compared the betting to rape by arguing in this favor
 unhone kaha tha, 'sattebaaji ko vaid ghoshit karne main koi nuksaan nahin he
 If you are unable to impose a ban on betting, then recognize it
 yah kuch aisa hi he ki aap rape nahin roak sakate to use enjoy karne lago
 The CBI chief finally had to bow down after strong objections from women's organizations and the BJP over the statement
 unhone kaha, 'mahilaon ke liye mere man main jo sammaan he, use main doharaana chahta hum
 i am sorry if my statement has hurt anyone's feelings unknowingly or unknowingly
 ''bain lagu karvaa paanaa mushkil he'sibiai diarector ne kaha tha, 'agar ham kuch pradeshon main lottery karvaa sakate hai, kuch jagahon par kisino kii ijaajat de sakate hai, jab sarkaar kaale dhan ko swechha se ujagar karne kii yojanaayen laa sakati he to sattebaaji ko manyata dene main kya nuksaan he? bain lagane kii baat kahana, use lagu karaane se kahin zyada aasaan he
 All-round attack on Sinha: After the controversial statement, all-round attacks on Ranjit Sinha started
 bijepi samate kai mahila sanghathanon ne unke bayaan par ghor aapatti jataai thi
 Former BJP president Nitin Gadkari even demanded Sinha's resignation
 purv ipies adhikari kiran bedi ne bhi unke bayaan ko kisi bhi haalat main manjuur kiye jane laayak nahin bataaya tha
 He wondered how a person sitting on such a big post could make such a statement
 bijepi kii ore se smriti irani ne bhi ranjit sinha ke is bayaan kii kadi aalochana kii thi
 The CBI had given government-cleanliness, although later on this statement was also clarified by the CBI, but that did not calm the dispute either
 sibiai ke ek pravaktaa ne kaha tha ki sinha kaa bayaan ek khaas sandarbh main tha
 The clarification given by the investigating agency said, 'RM Savani and cricketer Rahul Dravid and CBI Director were consulted on this
 sibiai nideshak ke kehane kaa itnaa hi matlab tha ki agar kanoon lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa to iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki kanoon hona hi nahin chahie
