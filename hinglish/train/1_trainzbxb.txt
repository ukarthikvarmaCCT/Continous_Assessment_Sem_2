 com / hkfodlabvg Virat Kohli not stressed about Hardik Pandya situation: Indian captain Virat Kohli said on Friday that he is not too worried about the possibility of a ban on Hardik Pandya's TV show in the case of 'inappropriate' remarks about women, Because the team has a choice in the form of Ravindra Jadeja
 australia main pehali baar test siries main jeet se utsahit bhartiya team pandya or lokesh rahul ke maidan ke baahar kii gatividhiyon ke kaaran surkhiyon main he
 The two made controversial comments on women in a TV show, putting them at risk of a two-match suspension
 kohli ne shanivaar ko khele jane vaale pehle match kii purv sandhya par kaha, ‘bharat main ham westeindies ke khilaaf ek anguli ke spinner or ek kalai ke spinner ke saath khele the
 It is good for us that a player like Jadeja exists, who can play the role of an all-rounder in such a situation (by banning Pandya)
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘ham ek team ke taur par zyada chintit nahin he, kyonki aapako hameshaa team main santulan banane kii sthiti kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 We keep such players in the team, who can replace the other in case of contribution with bat and ball when needed
 ’jab yah poocha gaya ki kya sanyas lene yaa bisisiai ke pratibandh hataane par vah australia kii big bash lig main khelenge to kohli ne kaha ki nishchit taur par sanyas lene ke baad vah is tarah ke kisi toornament ke liye uplabdh nahin honge
 On the eve of the first ODI against Australia on Saturday, the Indian captain said, "see, i don't know if this kind of attitude changes in future
" jahaan tak meraa sawaal he to ek baar sanyas lene ke baad or cricket khelnaa, eemaandaaree se kahuun to mujhe nahin lagata ki main un logon main shaamil hum
 'expensive cricketers, retired cricketers like Hardik pandya-kl rahulab de Villiers and Brendon mccullum, who were out of Sydney ODI regularly play in T20 leagues like IPL and Big Bash League, but Kohli said that this list i have no interest in joining
 unhone kaha, ‘pichley paanch saal main maine paryaapt cricket khelaa he or main is par bhi tippanee nahin kar saktaa ki sanyas lene ke baad main pehali cheez kya karuunga kyonki mujhe nahin lagata ki main dobaaraa balla uthaaungaa
 'kohli said,' On the day i stop playing, all my energy will be gone and that is why i will stop playing cricket
 isliye mujhe swayan ke dobaaraa maidan par utarkar khilne kii sambhaavna nahin dikhti
 Kohli said that he is happy with the current combination of the team and there is not much room for change in the squad for the ODI World Cup which starts in England from 30 May
 bhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘world cap se pehle hamaare paas ab zyada match nahin bache hai, isliye ham lagbhag usee team ke saath khelnaa chaahate hai, jo kamobesh world cap main khele
 The case of Jaspreet Bumrah is different
 unhen test match ke bhaar ko dekhte hue vishram diya gaya he
 Other than that, i do not think we will give much thought to team combination
 ’kohli ne haalanki kaha ki team main kuch jagahon ke liye form or fitness dekhne ke baad faisla kiya jayega
 He said, 'there are one or two places in the team where you may have to make changes, but apart from that we want to play with this combination before the World Cup
 ’ pandya or rahul teen maichon kii siries ke shuruuaati maichon ke liye shaayad uplabdh nahin rahenge jis par kohli ne kaha ki isse unhen tej gendbaajon ke saath prayog karne kaa mauka milegaa
 COA will say only when Hardik Pandya will play first ODI, KL Rahul: Kohli, he said, 'bhuvneshwar Kumar has returned
 vah test siries ke dauraan kadi mehnat kar rahe the
 Khalil Ahmed has done well in the opportunities he has got
 mohammad shami ke paas nai gend se wicket lene kii kaabiliyat he
 They will have a chance to establish themselves in the team
 ’ bhartiya captain ne kaha ki rahul or pandya ke maamle se team kaa dhyaan bhang nahin hua he
 He said, 'we have to go and perform in the field
 in bahari baton se world cap ke liye hamaari prerana or taiyaariyon par koi asar nahin padegaa

 Input: IANS haalanki, team india ne zimbabwe ko paanch−shunya se haraa diya he lekin thode samay baad fans shaayad is series ko sirf aise hi yaad karenge jaise koi ek kasak abhi baaki rah gai he
 
 
 
 paanch−shunya se jeet ke baavjood cricket ke jaankaar ise badi jeet nahin maanenge
 It will not be recorded as a big win in the history of Team India

 aise main zimbabwe main vanade series kam se kam kai yuva khilaadiyon ko taraashne kaa ek shandaar mauka tha lekin team india ke captain viraat kohli or team management apane is tosk main kaamyaab nahin rahe
 Pervez Rasul was always on the bench
 ajinkya rahane ko sirf ek match main mauka mila or ardhshtak thokkar unhone apane upar naakaami kaa thappa nahin lagane diya
 Ravindra Jadeja did not have to prove anything here
 ek tarah se unhen bina matlab paanch ke paanch match main utarkar dusron ko mauka lene se roak diya gaya
 Ravindra Jadeja took five wickets in the series and scored an unbeaten 48 runs in the last match and a total of 63 runs in five matches to lift the burden of failure
 kya in sabake baavjood ise kaamyaab mishan kah sakate hai
 
 
 Fans may be happy to win against Zimbabwe but will not get as many numbers as they would have won against a strong team
 is daure kaa makasad sirf zimbabwe ke kilaaf jeet hasil karnaa nahin balki yuva khilaadiyon ko aazmaana bhi tha
 
 
 But why did the team management and captain Kohli miss doing this
 
 
 ? Kohli missed the chance to give Parvez Rasool a chance in the last match as well, not allowing the entire team to flourish in the color of victory
 unhen rabindra jadeja kii jagah bhi team main shaamil kiya ja saktaa tha
 Taking five wickets in five matches, Jadeja proved nothing different from his ability

 aakhri match main mauka milane se rahane ko raahat to mili
 
 
 Ajinkya Rahane also scored the most fifty runs in the innings, but what can Rahane prove only with one chance
 
 
 
 The correct trial of the players identifies the homework of the team management, and this time despite the victory, this aspect of the team management looked light

 parvaiz rasul hameshaa hameshaa bench par hi rahe
 Ajinkya Rahane got a chance in only one match and he did not let him fail on his half-century
 rabindra jadeja ko yahaan kuch sabit karne kii zarurat nahin thi
 In a way, he was relegated to a five-for-five match without stopping others from taking a chance
 rabindra jadeja ne series main paanch wicket jatke or aakhri match main naabad 48 ran banaakar paanch match main kul 63 ran apane upar se naakaami kaa boj utaar diya
 Despite all this, can it be called a successful mission
 
 
 zimbabwe ke kilaaf jeet hasil karne se fans khush ho sakate hai lekin iske utane number nahin milenge jitne ki ek majboot team ke kilaaf jeet se milte
 The purpose of this tour was not only to win against Zimbabwe but also to try young players
 
 
 lekin team management or captain kohli aisa karne se kyon chook gaye
 
 
 The parvaiz rasul ko aakhri match main bhi mauka dene se chookkar kohli ne jeet ke rang main puri team ko nikharane kaa mauka nahin diya
 He could also be included in the team in place of Ravindra Jadeja
 paanch match main paanch wicket hasilakar jadeja ne apni kaabiliyat se alag kuch khaas nahin sabit kiya

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the former captain of the Indian cricket team and captain of the Chennai Super Kings, has completed his 5000 runs in T20 as a captain
 36 saal ke dhoni ne em
 This was achieved during a 70-ball unbeaten innings of 34 balls against Royal Challengers Bangalore on Wednesday night at the Chinnaswamy Stadium
 dhoni yah kirtiman rachane vaale duniya ke pehle ballebaaj ban gaye hai
 Captain Dhoni also hit seven sixes during his innings
 yah pehla mauka he jab unhone ipel kii ek pari main sabase zyada saat chakke lagaae
 He has scored two fifties in a season of IPL for the first time since 2013
 maidan par bhide the dhoni-kohli, sakshi-anoushka main bhi chal rahaa tha ek muqabladhoni ne match ke baad kaha ki yah jaruri he ki aapke dimag main hameshaa yah baat rahe ki kitne over bache hai or in deth overon main koun gendbaaji karegaa
 Chennai had a mammoth 206-run challenge against Bengaluru, falling four wickets for 74 runs and needed 132 runs in 11 overs to win from here
 CSK par haar kaa khatra mandara rahaa tha, lekin dhoni kuch or hi sochakar aae the

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni may have lost his chance to win the series 2–0, with the third and final Test drawn against the West Indies on Sunday, but said he was not disappointed with the result
 dhoni ne teesraa test dra hone ke saath bharat ke 1-0 se shrinkhalaa jeetne ke baad kaha, main nattejey se niraash nahin hum
 We did well in this match
 hamane wicket hasil karne kaa sarvshereshth prayaas kiya lekin unhone kaaphi acchhee ballebaaji kii
 The Indian captain said, it was a very slow wicket
 harbhajan singh ko haalanki turn or oochaal mil rahaa tha
 He (in the second innings) did well by taking four wickets
 tej gendbaajon ko haalanki kaaphi madad nahin mil rahi thi or puraani gend se gendbaaji karnaa kaaphi mushkil tha
 Dhoni defended his decision to agree to a test draw after the mandatory over was over, saying, "if we chased the target, the chance of winning the series could have been missed
" hamane mahasoos kiya ki jeet ke liye koshish karnaa phydemand nahin he
 We tried initially but we are happy to win the series
 westeindies ke captain derren saimi ne bhi bharat ke jeet kii koshish nahin karne par hairaani jataai
 He said, i am surprised (that after three wickets fell, he decided not to chase the target)
 dhoni ne shrinkhalaa main achche pradarshan ke liye yuva khilaadiyon visheshkar ishanth sharma kii jamkar tarif kii jinhen shrinkhalaa main 22 wicket chatakaane ke liye main of da siries bhi chunaa gaya

 Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister M
 despite the new Ministry of Finance on limiting gas price hike
 virappa moili ne aaj kaha ki gas ke daam badhaane ke sarkaar ke faisle main koi badlaav nahin hoga
 The government has decided to increase the price of domestic natural gas from April 1 next year
 sarkaar ne gas ke daam tay karne ke liye rangarajan samiti dwaara sujhaaye gayi formule ko manjuuri di he jiske anusaar agle saal se gas ke daam dogune ho jaayenge
 Moily said on Thursday, "there is no thought going on to review or reconsider the decision of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) at the government level
 yahaan koi bhram athwa isko lekar anischitata nahin he
 And i do not think there is any scope for further interpretation here
 ’gas mulya main vruddhi kaa sarkaar kaa faisla shuru se hi vivaadaaspad rahaa he
 Ever since this decision was taken at the CCEA meeting on 27 June, the government has been criticizing that the decision to increase the price has been taken to benefit Mukesh Ambani's company Reliance Industries
 moili ne kaha unke mantralay ne vitt mantralay se do baar unke vichaar maange or inhen sisiie ke note main shaamil kiya gaya
 The Finance Ministry in its remarks did not say anything like fixing the gas price limit or asking Reliance to sell gas at the old price
 moili ne kaha ‘mujhe nahin lagata ki iskaa kuch or arth nikaala ja saktaa he
 This decision was taken after much thought and i believe it took a long time
 ek baar nirnay le liye jane ke baad ham us par adig rahenge
 "bypassing the possibility of limiting the increase in gas prices," Moily said, "the CCEA decision remains intact
" isamen koi badlaav nahin he
 And not only the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, there is no consideration for change in the government also
 ’moili ne kaha ‘sisiie ne gharelu gas ke daam da
 The proposal to decide on the basis of the formula suggested by Rangarajan Committee has been approved
 is formule ke anusaar tay daam sabhi gharelu utpaadit gas or sabhi upabhokta kshetron par samaan rup se lagu honge
 According to the formula, the price of gas will be reviewed every quarter
 antarrashtriya bazaar main gas ke badhate daam ko dekhte huye yah chintaa bani he ki yadi gas mulya nirdhaaran ko khulaa chhod diya gaya to jald hi desh main gas ke daam 10 se 12 dollars tak pahunch jaayenge
 The new gas formula will remain in effect for five years

 By looking at the red marks visible on the bodies of the victims, you can yourself guess how brutally these innocent people have been beaten
 jab ajtak kii team ne peedit bacchiyon se is bare main poocha to unhone bataaya ki madrase ke maulavee ne kuch shabdon ko bolne ke liye kaha tha
 The cleric of the madrasa beat him severely with the belt for not speaking properly
 vahiin is bare main peedit bacchiyon ke pita se baat karne par unhone bataaya ki do maah purv donon bacchiyon ko noida ke sector -115 sthit madrase main talim ke liye bhartee karaayaa tha

 When the reporter of 'aaj Tak' reached the madrasa and spoke to the accused maulvi, he confessed his mistake and said, 'yes, i have made a mistake
 mai apni galati sweekaar karata hum
 But my anger was not due to any hostility
 chunki kai baar in bacchiyon ko bataane ke baad bhi inhen yaad nahin ho rahaa tha isliye mujhe gussa aa gaya
 Because of which i have made this mistake
 iske liye maine har tarah se maafi maangi he or aage maangane ke liye bhi taiyaar hum

 The CBI has questioned six IB officials in its investigation
 or ab sibiai kah rahi he ki poochtacha main kuch alag hi kahani nikalakar saamne aa rahi he
 According to CBI sources, the IB had received reports about Sadiq from three places
 pehali report mumbai ke gururaj saavadatti stesan se oktober 2002 main ai, iske baad duusari report ibi mukhyalay se usee varsh 24 november ko mili or phir antim report ahmedabad ke ai vibhaag se mili jahaan par rajindra kumaar tainaat the

 a quarrel case was registered in Sadiq's hometown Bhavnagar in 1996 and a second gambling case was registered in November 2002
 is maamle main use jamaanat mil gai thi
 After all the reports of the IB, Mumbai police detained on 19 December 2002 and the IB interrogated him for a week
 mumbai vibhaag ke ibi pramukh abandi gopinathan sibiai ko bataaya he ki sadik se poochtacha main unhen kuch bhi khaas nahin mila
 'in interrogation, Mumbai's IB department found that whatever preliminary information (regarding the attack on VVIP) about Sadiq was not being verified'

 Despite this, Sadiq was handed over to the Kaim Branch in Ahmedabad on 3 January 2013

 While Sadiq was given a clean chit from Mumbai IB and handed over to Gujarat on 6 January
 vahiin, rajindra kumaar ne ek report main kaha ki sadik ko abhi pakadaa nahin gaya he or use talashne ke prayaas jari hai

 baavjood iske 3 janvari 2013 ko sadik ko ahmedabad ke kim branch ko saunp diya gaya tha

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is going to Agra on 26 October amid political rhetoric on the historicity of the Taj Mahal
 upi siem yogi adityanath 26 oktober ko agra kaa daura karenge or apane is daure main vah tajmahal bhi dekhne jaaenge
 UP CM will also participate in a program of Tourism Department in Agra
 bharatiyon ke khun-paseene se bana he tajamahalagara daure main upi siem yogi adityanath tajmahal samet shahar ke kai smarak dekhne jaaenge
 At the same time, when asked to react to Sangeet Som's statement, CM Yogi Adityanath said that who says what, it is not important
 sabase jaruri yah he ki bharatiyon ke khun-paseene se bane har ek smarak kaa sangrakshan kiya jaae
 He also said that conservation of monuments is necessary from the point of view of tourism too
 unhone paryaton ko badhaava dene ke liye river front kaa vikaas karne kii bhi baat kahi
 Yogi further said that it is a matter of regret if the statements of Azam Khan and Owaisi are taken seriously
 tajmahal pyaar kaa pratik tha or rahegacongress netaa salmaan khurshid bhi tajmahal par jari bayaanbaji main kud pade hai
 He said that historical heritage like Taj Mahal which is among the 7 wonders of the world does not need the support of legislators like Sangeet Som
 unhone kaha, " bijepi vidhayak ke virodh se logon kii najaron main tajmahal kii ahmiyat kam yaa zyada nahin hone vaali he
 The Taj Mahal was and always will be a symbol of love for all civilizations, religions and countries
 "sangeet som ne diya tha yah bayansomvaar ko bijepi netaasangit som ke bayaan ke baadatajmahal par bayaanbaji shuru ho gai thi
 BJP MLA Sangeet Som had said that some people were in a lot of pain when the Taj Mahal's name was removed from the historical sites of the country
 som ne kaha tha ki tajmahal kaa itihaas kya he? tajmahal ke nirmaataaon ne hinduon kaa sarvanaash kiya
 What is the history of the man who imprisoned his father? sangeet som bole ki ab bhaajapa sarkaar desh ke itihaas se babar,akbar or aurangzeb kii kalank kathako itihaas se nikaalane kaa kaam kar rahi he
 Owaisi counterattacked AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, who retaliated at the Taj Mahal of BJP MLA Sangeet Som
 ovaisi ne kaha ki laal kile ko bhi gaddaaron ne banaaya tha, kya piem modi lalakile se tirangaa fahraana band kar denge
 Will modi-yogi forbid native and foreign tourists from visiting the Taj Mahal? ovaisi ne kaha ki hyderabad house bhi gaddaaron ke dwaara hi banaaya gaya tha, kya piem modi vahaan par videshi mehmaanon ko risive karnaa band kar denge
 Azam Khan also gave a sharp response Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan had said on the statement of Sangeet Som Singh on Taj Mahal that all the signs of slavery should be erased from the country
 ajam khan ne kaha he ki akele taj mahal hi kyon, sansad, raashtrapati bhawan, qutub minar, laal kila, sab gulaami kii nishaani hai
 Please tell that the Yogi government is often in the headlines regarding the Taj Mahal
 haal hi main yogi sarkaar ne tajmahal ko upi kii saanskrithik viraasat list main shumaar nahin kiya tha
 It is said that CM Yogi Adityanath has a different opinion about the Taj Mahal
 ek media report ke mutabik, bihar kii darbhanga raily main yogi ne yah tak kah diya tha ki unke liye tajmahal ek imaarat ke sivaa or kuch nahin he

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii sabha main phir hangaamaa hua
 The place was different
 amit shah ravivaar ko haryana ke jind main gaurav raily ko sambodhit karne gaye
 Some people present in the assembly showed black flags to the BJP president and raised anti-government slogans
 jis vakt yah sabakuch ho rahaa tha, us vakt manch par amit shah ke alaava rajya ke siem manohar laal khatter, kendriya mantri birendra singh sahit tamaam bade netaa maujuud the
 The protesters were junior basic teachers, who have been on strike for the last three months seeking to secure their jobs
 jab surat main hua shah kii sabha main hangaamaabite guuruuvaar ko bhi surat meghmit shaahaki sabha main hangaamaa hua tha
 Chairs were thrown at the ceremony and slogans were also raised in support of Patidar Amanat Andolan Samiti leader Hardik Patel
 yah hangaamaa aise vakt hua jab manch par shah ke alaava siem vijay roopani, purv siem anandiben patel or tamaam bade netaa maujuud the
 The police force also had a heavy presence
 lekin hangaamaa karne waalon par kaabo nahin paaya gaya or chaar ghante tak chalane vaala kaarykram ek ghante main hi khatm karnaa padaa
 In such a situation, for the second time in a meeting of the BJP President within a week, such an incident is not a good sign for the party
 agar party ke liye kahin acha hota he, to beshak iskaa shrey party adhyaksh ko diya janaa chahie or diya jaataa bhi he lekin agar kahin kuch gadabad hota he to iske liye bhi party adhyaksh ko jimmedaar tehraaya janaa chahie
 In Gujarat, chairs were thrown at the BJP president's meeting, while in Haryana black flags were shown
 gujarat main kareeb do dashak se lagaataar bijepi kii sarkaar he, jabaki do saal pehle haryana main pehali baar bijepi kii sarkaar bani he
 But everything is not going well in the ruling party in these two states
 ek taraf jat, duusari taraf pateldo saal pehle haryana main hue vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko sarkaar banane kaa janadesh mila or soobe main pehali baar bhagava party kii sarkaar bani
 But the dissatisfaction that has arisen in the state over the BJP high command's decision to choose CM has not stopped yet
 khatter ko jab haryana kaa siem banaaya gaya, to soobe main pehali baar kisi punjabi or 18 saal baad kisi gaiyr jat ko mukhyamantri kii kursi saunpi gai
 Jat vs non-jat debate also intensified in the state
 yahi haal gujarat kaa he
 In October 2001, the chair of CM was handed over to Narendra Modi from Keshubhai Patel
 2014 main modi ke piem banane ke liye anandiben patel ko satta saunpi gai
 Recently, a chair from Patel was handed over to Vijay Rupani
 roopani ne siem pad kii shapath lee, to unke cabinet main nau aise mantriyon kii chuttee kar di gai jinhen anandiben patel kaa vafaadaar mana jaataa tha
 Movement for reservation: In Haryana, the Jat community has already agitated for the demand of reservation
 lekin khatter sarkaar banane ke baad rajya main jat or gaiyr-jat samudaayon ke bich kii khai kaaphi gahari ho gai he
 The Jat community has staged violent demonstrations here in the past February and June
 gujarat main bhi yahi haal he
 The Patel community pledged to protest last year under the banner of Patidar Amanat Andolan Samiti to demand reservation in the state
 yah sanghathan patel samudaay ko obisi kaa darja die jane ke saath-saath sarkari naukariyon or padhai main 27 fisadi aarakshan kii maang kar rahaa he
 When the BJP government was formed in the chair of CM, the party high command introduced Manohar Lal Khattar as the CM
 aresas se jude khatter pehali baar vidhayak bane the or siem kii kursi saunp di gai
 This caused a wave of discontent among the local BJP leaders who had been trying to strengthen the party's foundation in the state for years
 jab saamne ai BJP kii andruni kalahpichley dinon jab gujarat kii satta anandiben se lekar vijay roopani ko saunpi gai, to party kii andruni kalah saamne aa gai thi
 In the meeting of the legislature party, Anandiben vetoed Rupani's name
 wo nitin patel ko siem kii kursi saunpna chaahati thim
 However, after the intervention of PM Modi, Anandiben bowed down and Rupani was chosen as the leader
 team main pakad nahin, leadership kaa abhavharyana main siem khatterco lekar asantosh kii khabaren aati rahi hai
 Last February, 100 BJP leaders resigned after triggering a rebellion against the Khattar government
 ye jat aarakshan andolan ke dauraan police-prashasan kii karrwai se naaraaz the
 In February, the state's top leader and sports minister Anil Vij had expressed his displeasure with the cm's intervention in his office
 farvari main hi vij or khatter ke bich jat andolan ke mritkon ko muaavja dene ko lekar bhi matbhed saamne aae the
 The popularity of the Congress has started to increase, there is no one in Gujarat whose leadership is like Modi
 jab narendra modi gujarat ke siem the, to party or sarkaar main kisi tarah kii khinchataan kii khabar nahin aati thi, lekin inke dilli jate hi jaise sabakuch bikharane laga or rajya main pratidwandi congress kii lokapriyata badhane lagi he
 Lack of foresight whether it is Gujarat or Haryana, the current governments here are not able to assess the circumstances in time
 vaise to gujarat or haryana vikaas ke paimaane main agrani rajya hai, lekin in rajyon main jati kaa factor bhi utana hi haaavee he or sarkarein ise nazarandaaj karte hue shashan nahin kar saktin
 Whether the issue of Jat reservation in Haryana or the law and order issue in the state, the Khattar government has proved to be a failure on all fronts
 siem khatter rajya main jaaton ko saadhane main naakaam rahe hai
 There have been two violent agitations this year on reservation for Jats
 jat aarakshan andolan se bhadki hinsa se samaaj main ek gahari khai bhi najar aane lagi he
 Here non-jat people have started opposing Jats
 gujarat main patidaar samudaay narazudhar, surat kii sabha main hangaamaa karne vaale patel samudaay ke log bataae ja rahe hai jo soobe kii sattarudh bijepi se naaraaz chal rahe hai
 The Patidar community is a big vote bank in Gujarat and is angered by its neglect in state power
 pichley saal hardik patel ke aahvaan par gujarat main pradarshan hue, to rajya sarkaar ne inase nipatane main behad kadai kaa parichay diya
 Hardik was jailed and hundreds of protesters were arrested
 surat kii sabha main bhi hangaamaa karne vaale sau se adhik patel yuvakon ko pehle hiraasat main liya gaya phir chhod diya gaya
 Spain's industry minister resigned on Friday in the 'panama Papers' episode
 un par aarope lage hai ki unke videshi companiyon se sambandh hai
 Minister Jose Manuel Soria said that he has resigned over the past few days in connection with his many mistakes regarding his explanations for business activities and considering the loss to the Spanish government from this situation

 The comments psoria ne ek samvaadadaata sammelan bulaakar company se koi bhi sambandh hone se inkaar kiya tha lekin samay ke saath or media sansthaanon dwaara videshi companiyon se or kathith sambandhon kaa khulaasa hua
 It is not clear at the moment whether any of his alleged actions were illegal

 Soria's crisis began on Monday when the Spanish online newspaper 'il Confidential', which obtained leaked papers of 'panama Papers', said he was the administrator of a foreign firm in 1992
 tippaniyan Soria had denied having any ties to the company by calling a press conference but over time and alleged links with foreign companies were revealed by media institutions
 philhal yah spasht nahin hua he ki unki koi bhi kathith kaarywahi avaidh thi yaa nahin

 madhya pradesh se hairaan kar dene vaala maamla saamne aayaa he
 29 students from different schools of Madhya Pradesh are selected for participation in the 'pacific School Games' to be held next month in Adelaide, Australia
 in vidhyaarthiyon ko passport samet kagajaat puure karne ke liye mahaj 3 din die jate hai
 Then a final list of the team going to Australia is released 20 days later
 ab is list main 29 kii jagah chune gaye sirf 19 vidhyaarthiyon ke naam hi bache rah jate hai
 The shocking thing that comes up in this list is that the name of Madhya Pradesh school education minister Vijay Shah comes as the head of the Indian team
 shah ke saath madhya pradesh ke 5 afasaron ke naam bhi bhartiya dal ke sadasyon ke taur par list main jud jate hai
 All these names were added to the list in place of those students who could not submit the necessary documents including passports in the given time
 public instrections diarectorat(jan nirdesh nideshaalay) ne 31 oktober 2017 ko skulon se chune gaye 29 vidhyaarthiyon kii list nikaali thi jinhen basketbaal, footbal, hockey, netball, softball, tairaaki, diving or trek-field events aadi main hissaa lene ke liye chunaa gaya
 The selected students were asked to submit the required documents including passport in just 3 days
 hairaani kii baat he ki skool games federeshan of india, jiskaa mukhyalay agra main he, 20 november ko ek final list jari karata he jisamen madhya pradesh se australia jane vaale logon ke naam darj hote hai
 In this final list, only 19 out of 29 students selected earlier remain
 baaki ke naam isliye hataa die gaye kyonki wo vakt par passport samet jaruri kagajaat jamaa nahin kara paae
 Those whose names were removed from the list also include two real sisters Asha and Anjali
 donon bahanen bhopal ke emelbi skool main padhati hai
 Both started playing softball five years ago and won several medals at the national level in the sport
 donon bahanon ke liye 'pacific skool games' ke liye sellection hona bada sapana puraa hone se kam nahin tha
 Both did not have passports and it was not possible for them to complete all the formalities and submit the documents in just three days
 skool games federeshan of india kii ore se 20 november ko jari final list main bhartiya dal ke pramukh ke taur par madhya pradesh ke schoolishiksha mantri vijay shahor rajya ke 5 adhikariyon kaa naam dal ke aadhikarik sadasyon ke taur par judaa tha
 Madhya Pradesh School Education Department is spending 2
5 lakh rupees on every member of the team
 bataa den ki australia ja rahe madhya pradesh ke in adhikariyon main se koi bhi naa to kisi khel kaa coach he or naa hi kisi kaa khel anushaasan se koi judaav rahaa he
 However, when Minister Vijay Shah was contacted about this, he denied that anything was wrong
 shah ne skool games federation of india kii chitthee ko apane bachaav main pesh bhi kiya
 Shah said he was selected to lead the 180-member Indian contingent going to Australia
 jab vijay shah se is bare main sampark kiya gaya to unhone kaha ki unhone kuch galat nahin kiya
 Shah presented a letter written by SFI in his defense
 shah kaa daawa he ki unhen federeshan kii ore se chune gaye 180 bhartiya pratibhaagiyon ke dal kaa netritv karne ke liye chunaa gaya
 For this he cited his long experience
 jis chitthee kaa zikr shah ne kiya wo 17 november ko likhi gai thi
 Surprisingly, two days after this, on November 20, the final list of students and officials of Madhya Pradesh going to Australia was released
 aashcharya he ki ye chitthee federeshan kii ore se shah ko 17 november ko likhi gai
 Two days later, on November 20, a list of the names of the selected players and accompanying officials was released
 yahaan ye sawaal uthta he ki kaise mantri or anya adhikariyon ne sirf do din main hi apane sabhi kagajaat puure kar jamaa kara die
 The note that was with the list is also worth noting
 is note par likhaa tha ki nimnlikhit khilaadi or adhikari, jinhone apane kagajaat jamaa kar die hai, safaltaapurvak panjikrut kiye gaye hai, ab isamen or sadasyon ko jodna naa to sambhav he or naa hi hamaare haath main he
 The opposition Congress has called the case a matter of fixed priorities of the government
 vipaksh ke netaa ajay singh ne kaha ki ye bahut hi durbhagyapurna he
 It shows the priorities of the government
 mantri kaa naam pehle nahin tha or wo achaanak dal ke pramukh ban jate hai
 The names of the selected students are removed from the list
 baharhaal, yahaan jo sabase bada sawaal he ki jab final list 20 din baad jari kii gai to chune gaye vidhyaarthiyon ko passport samet tamaam paperwork puraa karne ke liye maatr teen din kaa hi vakt kyon diya gaya? jabaki mantri ko 17 november ko chitthee bheji gai or 20 november ko jari final list main mantri or paanch adhikariyon kaa naam sabhi aupchaariktaayen puri hone ke saath darj ho gaya

 australian ballebaaj philip huge kii maut ke baad se hi cricket jagat main bounsar ko lekar joardaar bahes chhidi hui he, lekin diggajon kaa maananaa he ki bounsar par pratibandh lagaaya janaa gendbaazon ke saath ninsaphi he
 Former Indian batsman and coach of Team India, Anshuman Gaekwad himself has passed through a similar bouncer ball to death on the cricket pitch
 varsh 1976 main west indies daure main sabina park maidan par maaikel holding kii gend unke baayen kaan par lagi, or unhen do din tak isiu main rahanaa padaa
 His earrings were torn, and he is still heard today, but Anshuman Gaekwad is still against Bain on the bouncer
 unka kahana he, "un dinon ham helmet bhi nahin pahante the
 
 
 If an inch were to hit the ball here or there, i would not have been alive today
 
 
 bounsar khelnaa ballebaazon ke liye sabase badi chunauti he
 
 
 Risks occur in every game
 
 
 (philip) huge ke saath jo hua, vah bahut dukhad he, lekin hamen samajhnaa chahie ki yah ek asaamaanya dughartna thi
 
 
 Bouncers should not be banned
 
 
 " According to former Indian spin bowler Erapalli Prasanna, no batsman would have faced the dreaded pace battery of the West Indies more than Sunil Gavaskar, considered among the most respected batsmen in the country
 gavaskar kii safalataa ke peeche bounsar ko khilne kii unki majboot baikfoot takanic bhi rahi
 Great players such as Gavaskar, Vijay Manjrekar, and West Indies batsmen Vivian Richards and Gary Sobers had developed a technique against the bouncers, and these batsmen would have dropped from the line of the ball, or hooked if needed
 Used to give ye takanic behtareen thi
 Whatever new rules the ICC has made to popularize cricket in recent years are in favor of the batsmen, so former Indian fast bowler Javagal Srinath says that removing bouncers in such an environment makes bowling absolutely Will remain meaningless
 unhone kaha, "bounsar ko hataane yaa phir ek over main do se ghataakar ek karne par khel kaa santulan bighad jayega
 
 
 Removing the bouncer will prevent death, it is not even guaranteed
 
 
 ballebaaz kaa ek tej shot gendbaaz ke sir par lag jaae to bhi uski zindagi khatre main pad sakati he
 
 
 " ullekhneey he ki purv visphotak salaami ballebaaj virendra sahvaag bhi bounsar par pratibandh ke khilaaf raay vyakt kar chuke hai
 During a press conference, Sehwag had said, ducking (bowing) is the best way to avoid short pitch balls
 unhone kaha, "yah bahut afsosna he ki philip huge kii maut is tarah hui, lekin chot cricket kaa hissaa he
 
 
 You can duck facing a bouncer, but if the bouncer is removed, the game will not be fun
 
 
 main bhi helmet par chot kha chukaa hum, lekin cricket vaise bhi ballebaazon kaa game he, so, aise main bounsar gendbaazon kaa acha hathiyaar he
 
 
 " so, phil huge ko sachhee shradhanjali yah ho sakati he ki bounsar gendon par pratibandh lagane par vichaar karne kii jagah suraksha upkarnon ko behatar banane par jor de

 In 21 days, 31 people were killed in Mumbai, since 21 days, the fire has created a death sentence

 bhartiya reserve bank (RBI) ke purv governor raghuram rajan kaa kahana he ki shaktishaalee padon par baithe logon ko aalochana ko sahan karnaa chahie, or unhone ek blog main chetaya he ki aalochanaon ko dabaate rahane se nitigat galtiyaan shartiya hongi
 Raghuram Rajan has also said that criticism is the only way in which the government takes corrective policy steps
 jane-maane nyayavid tathaa udaarvaad ke agrani pairokaar nani palkivaala kii uplabdhiyon ko yaad karte hue RBI ke purv governor ne likhaa, "har prayek aalochak ko sarkari adhikari kii ore se phone par peeche hatane ke liye kaha jayega, yaa sattashin dal kii trol army kaa nishaanaa banaaya jayega, to bahut-se log apni aalochana kaa sur nicha kar lenge, use halkaa kar lenge
 
 
 In such a situation, the government will be able to spend time in a good-looking environment until the bitter truth can be truly ignored
 
 
 "unhone jor dekar kaha ki satta main shaktishaalee padon par baithe logon ko aalochana ko bardaasht karnaa hi hoga
 Raghuram Rajan said, "undoubtedly, some criticisms, including criticisms being made in the media, are based on misinformation, aimed specifically, against the person at the place of office
 
 
 nishchit rup se pichhali naukariyon ke dauraan mere khilaaf bhi aisa hua he
 
 
 However, suppressing criticism is a panacea for policy mistakes
 
 
 "vartmaan main uniwarsity of chicago main finance ke professor ke rup main karyrat raghuram rajan ne kaha ki lagaataar kii jane vaali aalochana se sudharatmak nitigat kadam uthaae ja sakate hai
 He said, "governments that suppress the tone of public criticism do their own great harm
 
 
 "raghuram rajan ke in vichaaron kii prishthbhumi main pradhanmantri kii aarthik salaahkaar parishad se ratin roy tathaa shamika ravi ko modi sarkaar dwaara hataaya janaa he, jinhen kathith rup se isliye hataaya gaya, kyonki ve sarkaar kii nitiyon kii aalochana kiya karte the

 patr ne jab is bare main appal se sampark kiya to vahaan se use koi jawaab nahin mila
 At the moment all the big retailers are angry with the sale of iphone online and they say that they will not sell iphone because customers say that these phones are being found cheap at online retailers

 chakravaati tufaan vaayu to gujarat ke tat ko chhukar aage bad gaya lekin 21 saal pehle aise hi tufaan ne gujarat ke tateey kasbe kandla ko barbaad kar diya tha
 June 9, 1998 was a normal day
 aasmaan bhi saaf tha
 Suddenly, the sky turned black
 tej hawaaen chalane lagi
 In just 6 hours, the entire Kandla town was hit by the storm
 teji se badhate jalastr ne logon ke gharon, kheton or namak ke maidaanon ko apni jad main lenaa shuru kar diya
 People started running in high places
 namak ke maidaanon main kaam karne vaale jayanti bhai ne bataaya ki tufaan aate hi main, meraa parivaar or 28 log mere do manjila makaan kii chat par chale gaye
 At that time, the waves of 25 feet rising in the sea were coming fast in the town
 jayantibhai ne bataaya ki waisi hi 25 feet oonchi lahar unke ghar se takaraai or puraa ghar gir gaya
 Jayantibhai survived by holding a pillar but his wife, two daughters and the rest were swept away
 jayantibhai kehete hai ki yah durvasa rishi ke shraap se bhi bhayaavah tha
 The entire Kandla was the only scene of death and ruin
 puure kasbe main shav faile hue the
 The survivors were searching for their families

 The hospital's balcony, lobby and waiting hall had become temporary mortgages

 On 4 June 1998, the Indian Meteorological Department issued a cyclone warning on the Arabian Sea
 7 june ko dopaher 12
 At 30, the Meteorological Department again issued a warning that the cyclone moving towards the shores of Gujarat is frightening
 isse saurashtra or kuccha ke tateey ilaako main baari barish hogi, tej hawaaen chalengi
 It also includes Kandla
 8 june ko phir mausam vibhaag ne kandla ke red alert kii chetavanee jari kii
 But the government slept
 madad ai lekin hajaaron logon ke marane ke baad
 Whereas, thousands of people could have been saved easily
 1998 main tivi kii pahunch bahut kam logon ke paas thi
 People could not get the news
 aam logon ko ekadam pataa nahin tha ki kitna bhayaavah tufaan unki ore aa rahaa he
 According to official figures, 1173 people died due to the storm
 1774 log laapata the
 But the media report was contrary to these figures
 1998 main india today main prakashit khabar ke anusaar kam se kam 4 hajaar logon kii maut hui thi
 Thousands of people went missing

 There was a loss of 33 crores rupees

 kahaan? doklam pathaar par?nahin
 In the Chavadi market
 dua kiijie ki bhutan ke pathaar par china se do-do haath na ho lekin chaavdi bazaar main china se jang kar leni chahie
 This war will have its own price, but the benefits are not less and if we want to fight it in New York Manhattan or London's Oxford Street, that is, we want to sour China's teeth in the global market, then a bigger army is needed
 china ke pracheen yuddh guru sun tju ne kaha tha ki shatru kii takat ke bare main jaankaree bhoot-preton se nahin milti, na hi baaten yaa kayaas kaam aate hai, dushman kii hakeekat jaanane vaale log hi bataa sakate hai ki uske kheme main kitni takat he
 
 
 Hence, a look at China's business strength
 duniya ko 2,097 arab dollar (lagbhag 13 kharab ru
 ) Exports, imports of $ 1,587 billion, trade surplus of $ 509 billion (2016 figures) but even then China accounts for only 14 percent of the world's total trade
 china ise badhaate jane kii takat se las he
 China has total foreign investment of $ 126 billion and foreign exchange reserves of $ 3,000 billion
 ek kharab dollar kii van belt, van road pariyojna jo 60 deshon main buniyadi dhaancha banaaegi
 These countries would later become the center of cheap production for China
 isamen pakistan main 46 arab dollar kaa nivesh shaamil he
 China is India's largest trading 'friend'
 har saal kareeb 61 arab dollar kaa chini saamaan bharat aata he or bharat bamushkil 10 arab dollar kaa niryaat china ko karata he
 China has the advantage of $ 51 billion
 bharat ke kai pramukh menuphaccharing kshetra apni adhikansh aapurtiyon ke liye china ke mohataaj hai telecom equipment, electronics, dawaaen, computer hardware, loha-ispaat bade aayaat hai
 Let it be said that despite long-term conflict with China, the two-way trade is going on and there will be many Indian industries faltering due to the supply stoppage
 china se jang lambii or mushkilon bhari hogi
 In the last three years, the government has done nothing for its preparation
 chini purje istemaal kar rahi electronics or telecom companiyon se, sarkaar ne haal main hi suraksha par sawaal-jawaab kiye hai
 The National Manufacturing Policy was formulated in 2012 through similar questions, which were an attempt to reduce dependence on China in select industries
 yah niti 'mek in india' kaa aadhaar he
 'make in India' has to be shunned by slogans and focused on making concessions to industries (telecom equipment, electronics, medicines, computer hardware) where we cannot breathe without China
 swadeshi vaale kuch samay tak shant rahen
 Products in which we depend on China do not have technology in India
 isliye europea or america companiyon ko khaas protsaahan dekar bulaanaa hoga or gharelu takneekon ke vikaas main nivesh karnaa hoga
 Small industries will respond to cheap Chinese goods, which are called micro multinationals in China
 inhen aatmanirbharta ke sipaahi banane ke liye bajet se sansaadhan dene honge
 Did we think about China while creating GST? The GST has imposed a heavy tax on all industries where it competes with China
 jiesti ne china ke saste saamaan ke mukaable bharat ko kahin zyada mahangaa utpaadan centre bana diya he
 If China is to be defeated then the power of the rupee will have to decrease
 joardaar niryaat ke liye rupye kaa avamulyan chahie
 Whatever the war, it has its own value
 china se jo jang hamen ladgai hogi yah rahi uski keemtahvideshi nivesh (gaiyr chini) or udyogon ko pratyaksh protsaahan yani bajet se kharchaa yani zyada ghatjisti main pherbadal or riyaayaten arthath kam rajasvchin se aayaat par sakhti arthath supplai main kami yani mahangaisasta rupaya yani mahange ayatdesh kii aarthik nitiyon main samgr badlaav, sarkari kharch par niyantransun tju ne kaha tha ki yuddh ke bagaiyr hi shatru ko haraana hi sabase uttam yuddh kala he
 This art is attained only by economic strength
 china kii takat uski vishaal sena yaa sajo-saaman main nahin balki 3,000 arab dollar ke videshi mudra bhandar main chhipi he
 Let's fight with China
 yah ladaai hamen berogari se jeet kii taraf le jaaegi

 Without basic facilities like food, shelter, water and clean toilets forcing them to undertake difficult pilgrimage
 'the way Pinarayi Vijayan’s govt is handling the sensitive issue of Sabarimala is disappointing

 congress mahasachiv or yuvaraj rahul gandhi ne upi ke vartmaan or purv mukhyamantri mayawati or mulaayam singh yadav kii jam kar khinchaai kii
 Rahul questioned the 'muslim love' of Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and accused Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati of living in the 'UP Shining' mogul
 dekhen upi chunaav par vistrut kavarejrahul ne sapa or basapa dwaara apane-apane chunaav ghoshnaptr main kiye gayi vaadon ko jhooth bataate hue kaha ki is party ke netaa chunavi bela main vah sab kuch kehane ko taiyaar hai jo janata sunanaa chaahati he
 In UP, the Congress general secretary said in an election meeting held in Ambedkarnagar, 'mulayam Singh says that Congress gave lesser reservation to Muslims
 vah khud teen baar rajya ke mukhyamantri rahe lekin unhone apane str par is disha main kuch nahin kiya or jab rashid masood ne aarakshan kii baat kahi to unhen party se nikaal diya
 While denying Yadav's promise about Muslim reservation, Rahul said, "mulayam Singh says he will give 28 percent reservation
" ucchtam nyaayalay ne kaha he ki itnaa aarakshan nahin diya ja saktaa lekin mulaayam kah rahe hai ki vah denge
 They lie
 vah sochate hai ki janata kuch nahin samajhati
 'rahul said,' Mulayam Singh is talking about giving electricity, water and reservation
 vah sochate hai ki janata kuch nahin samajhegi
 They make promises but do nothing when it comes to fighting for the rights of the people
 ’ rahul ne kaha, ‘mulaayam teen baar mukhyamantri bane
 We sent a grain of PDS
 unke logon ne usamen ghotaalaa kiya
 Stole your food
 ’ mayawati par ‘upi shining’ ke mugalate main jeene kaa aarope lagaate hue rahul ne kaha ki mukhyamantri ke afasaron ne unhen bataaya ki vah bahut acchhee tarah shashan kar rahi hai or uttar pradesh chamak rahaa he
 Rahul said, 'these big officers close the eyes of the leaders
 mayawati jab mukhyamantri baniin to unke adhikariyon ne kaha ki aap bahut acha kaam kar rahi hai or aapako gaanvon main jane or mazdooron, kisaanon se baat karne kii jarurat nahin he
 Uttar Pradesh is shining
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘mayawati ne bhi samaj liya ki uttar pradesh chamak rahaa he or vah gaanvon main janaa bhul gayin
 Do you have any shortcoming that she does not go with you
 ’rahul ne kaha, ‘hindustan main sabase badi kami yah he ki aapke netaa aapke bich nahin jate
 In your homes, do not talk to farmers, women and laborers
