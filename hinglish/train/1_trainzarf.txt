 6 convicts, including Anandpal, were sentenced to life imprisonment

 At one time, Anandpal Singh was so in awe that even the policemen started shivering in his name

 Holes have been made in the walls made of stones to fire at enemies
 tahkhaane main mila tha lohe kaa pinjrouse farm house ke tahkhaane ke bheetar ek ore tahkhaana mila tha
 a cage of iron was found in the cellar, in which Anandpal might have been imprisoned with the intention of torturing his enemies, or the people brought for ransom would have been kept in this cage

 supreme court ne muslim pakshakaron kii us daleel par mangalvaar ko aapatti jataayi ki hinduon ke do pavitra granthon ‘valmiki ramayana' or ‘ram charitamanas' main is baat kaa sateek zikr nahin he ki bhagwaan ram kaa janmasthan ayodhya he or saath hi nyaayalay ne poocha ki bhakton ko is baat ko maanane se kyon vanchit kiya jaae ki bhagwaan ram kaa janm ek khaas sthaan par hua tha
 a five-member bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi questioned senior advocate Zafaryab Jilani, appearing for the Muslim parties
 jilani ne daleel di ki pavitra granthon or yahaan tak ki abul fazal kii ine-e-akabari main bhi hinduon kii sadiyon puraani is tathakthith aasthaa kaa zikr nahin he ki bhagwaan ram ne ram janmabhumi-babari masjid ke kendriya gumbad main janm liya tha jise ab dhwast kar diya gaya he
 The bench also comprises Justice SA Bobde, Justice DY Chandrachud, Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice SA Nazir
 peeth ne kaha, ‘‘sirf isaliye ki ‘valmiki ramayana' or ‘ramcharita maanas' main ayodhya main us sateek sthaan kaa zikr nahin he, jahaan ram ne janm liya to kya hindu yah nahin maan sakate ki ram kaa ayodhya main ek khaas sthaan par janm hua tha
 The court objected to Jilani's plea on the 30th day of the hearing of the case that ain-e-akbari had the smallest details of historical events related to the 10th BCE, but in relation to the disputed site being the birthplace of Lord Rama The faith of Hindus is not mentioned
 baharhaal, jilani is vishwaas par raji hue ki ayodhya kaa bhagwaan ram kaa janmasthan hona sahi he or bahari baraamde main ‘ram chabutare' kaa janm sthaan hone ko lekar koi vivaad nahin he
 a lower court also said this and no appeal was filed against that order
 varisht adhivaktaa peeth ke sawaalon kaa jawaab de rahe the
 The bench also asked that there is no dispute that Lord Rama was born in Ayodhya and the dispute is only about the birthplace in the holy city

 Martin mcewanapril, more than a dozen Dalits took to the streets in 2018 to protest the Supreme Court order weakening certain provisions of the Scheduled Castes (prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
 adaalat ne is dharna kii pushti ke liye koi shodhapurna vishwasaneey aankada na hone ke baavjood apane avlokan main, 'nihit swaarthon' dwaara adhinium ke 'durupyog' kaa ullekh kiya tha
 Thus the order of March 20, 2018 prohibited that provision of law to prevent this misuse, which allows arrest on the complaint and anticipatory bail for the accused
 daliton ke liye, yah bada jhatka tha
 He did not expect this from the supreme court of the country, especially when he had never met his guide, Dr
 bi
 R
 ambedkar ke bataae gaiyr-hinsak or sanvaidhanik tareekon par chalate hue pratirodh kaa maarg kabhi nahin choda tha
 In early October of this year, the Supreme Court withdrew the March 2018 order and removed the earlier directives but Dalits and tribals never celebrated this important milestone as their victory
 pehle kii adalati karrwai ke ghaav gahare the or uske nishaan shesh rah gaye hai, jisase nyaaypalika par usee tarah kaa vishwaas ek baar phir sthapit hona mushkil ho gaya he
 For Dalits, such diversions are not new
 apane buniyadi maanav adhikaron ko surakshit karne kii apni kathin yatra main ve aisi paristhitiyon kaa kai baar saamana kar chuke hai
 From being denied the right to progress by declaring the 'untouchable' caste to being declared equal citizens, they have seen so many hurdles, although the talk of an equal citizen is still more on paper, their Enemies have been more powerful

 But those constitutional guarantees achieved with great difficulty are also now in danger
 apni is lambii yatra main ek nae mode par pahunchakar daliton ko pataa chalata he ki unka antim hathiyaar, kanoonee suraksha bhi khatre main he
 On the political front, it was better to go with mainstream parties than to stand with a Dalit party, such as the Republican Party of India
 ambedkar ko bhagwaan kii tarah poojane ke baavjood, ve alag-thalag padane kaa jokhim nahin uthaanaa chaahate the isliye mukhyadhara kii rajnatik partiyon ke saath gaye
 But now serious concerns have emerged about this strategy of political integration
 bhale hi endie ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sabase adhik essi / asti kii arakshit siten jeetin, jisase use badhat mili lekin sarkaar ke aankade hi bataate hai ki daliton or adivaasiyon par atyaachaar uske pehle kaarykaal ke dauraan badha he (dekhen: martin maikwaan dwaara sampadit bhed-bharat, dalit shakti prakaashan, 2019)
 What is most disturbing is the lack of a political will to deal strongly with caste violence
 siver linon kii haathon se safai karte hue safaikarmiyon ke mar jane ko 'atyaachaar' nahin mana jaataa
 This points to the devaluation of Dalit votes, which was remarkably untouchable for any political party
 duniya ke sabase bade loktantr bharat ke liye asprishyata kaa daag behad sharmnaak he yaa hona chahie, jo ab vishwa kii pramukh arthvyavastha banane kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 The current government, which is determined to take India's economy and development of the country to a great level, also follows in the footsteps of its predecessors, seems far removed from the reality that India has failed to free itself from untouchability
 
 yah aisi saamaajik buraai he, jisaki daliton par atyaachaar kii jaden bahut gahari hai
 This situation raises serious questions on the meaning of 'development'
 aazaadee ke baad, bharat ne asprishyata ke khilaaf vaisaa utsaahpurn saamaajik andolan nahin dekha jaisaa aazaadee se pehle dekha gaya tha
 On the contrary, the government today scares the voluntary organizations raising these issues which demand constitutionally determined action from the government on concerns such as abolition of untouchability, abolition of manual scavenging, violence against Dalits and tribals
 
 june 2016 main consteble vir singh ke tirange main lipte shav ke dah sanskaar ko lekar kadavaahat ko dekhnaa bahut pareshaan karne vaala tha
 Singh, who belongs to the Dalit Nat community of Nagla Kewal village in Firozabad district of Uttar Pradesh, was one of the eight CRPF personnel killed in a terrorist attack in Pampore (jammu and Kashmir)
 saarvajanik bhoomi par unke mrit sharir ke dah sanskaar kii anumati dene ke liye singh ke gaanv ke shaktishaalee savarnon ko manaane ke liye jila adhikariyon ko bahut mashkkat kerani padi
 This story is also no exception — there is nothing new about caste oppression against the families of Dalit jawans of the armed forces in their own villages, though they rarely make news
 isse kisi ko aashcharya nahin hona chahie
 After all, how many people remember that a Dalit MP from the ruling BJP in Karnataka was not allowed to enter a village in his own constituency last September? Did it become a cause of uproar at the national level? Was this not enough reason for protest? However, it was shown that the villagers had sent a chair to the MP to sit outside the village to pay respects to the MP
 yahi nahin, unhone garv ke saath kaha ki ve bhedbhaav main koi bhedbhaav nahin baratate or unhone saansad kii tarah hi sthaneey dalit vidhayak ko bhi gaanv main pravesh kii anumati nahin di thi
 All this happened in the presence of police
 or sarkaar / sarkarein ek maun chuppi saadhen rakhti hai
 Worse, 88 Dalit members of Parliament also kept silence on the subject
 saansad swayan hi is ghatana ke madhyam se apane mahimamandan kii koshishen karte dikhe or bataaya ki unhone swayan police ko bal prayog se roka tha kyonki vah logon kii antaratma ko jhakzor kar unke hriday parivartan kii ek koshish karnaa chaahate the
 His response is a silent acknowledgment that the means of social justice — law, vote (16
 5 pratishat, isse kam nahin) or daliton ke liye rajnatik-shaikshanik aarakshan vagairah—apni dhar kho chuke hai
 It seems clear as daylight that the Dalits will have to redesign their struggle for equality
 sankat or gaharaa he kyonki dalit aapas main jati bhed ko khatm karne main buree tarah asafal rahe hai
 a first-of-its-kind study, 'understanding Untouchability', conducted in 2016 by the Gujarat-based grassroots Dalit organization Navsarjan Trust (the author of which is the founder), confirms the fact that caste-based discrimination, as in Dalits
 And as is seen among non-dalits, the same discrimination exists between different Dalit sub-castes
 jaahir he ki khud dalit hi jatigat bhedbhaav khatm karne ke ambedkar ke aahvaan se bhatak gaye hai
 Although the younger leaders cite the confrontation between Gandhi and Ambedkar over the Poona Pact of 1932, there is a lot of poison in the minds of young Dalits against Gandhi, but the fact is that both of these great thinkers believed the same Moral force has more attraction power than legal power or position power
 donon hi apni-apni tarah se iskaa hal talash rahe the
 It is a matter of great shame that as a nation, we have a lot of money to spend on war planes which will ultimately not help anyone win, but we have to stop the constant attacks like malnourishment or tribal mothers
 And there is no concrete program aimed at protecting the most vulnerable like children
 ham is bhram ko banaae rakhte hai ki bhedbhaav or anyaay kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan hamaare rajnatik sansthaanon se hi nikalegaa
 The time has come to revisit this puzzle and understand the value of a strong civil society
 vidambnaa he ki khud ko sangathit karne ke ambedkar ke aahvaan ko amiron ne samaj liya or sangathit hone lage lekin jin daliton or adivaasiyon, garibon or vanchiton ke liye unhone yah aahvaan kiya tha, ve hi ambedkar kii baat ko nazarandaaj kar rahe hai

 ek yajidi ladki ke saamne aane ke baad bagdadi ke bazaar kii kuch aisi kahaniyaan saamne ai hai, jo rongte khadey karne vaali hai
 Narrated Nadia, who escaped from the clutches of the tribesmen, according to ISIS militants, along with at least 150 people from her village, had caught her from Sinjar and then brought her to Mosul
 vahaan nadia jaisi hajaaron ladakiyon ko pakad kar rakhaa gaya tha
 All of them were then sold as sex slaves
 vahaan nadia samet tamaam ladakiyon ke saath rape kiya gaya
 Girls were exchanged like gifts
 jo iske liye taiyaar nahin hoti thi, uske saath aisa julm hota tha ki dekh kar rongte khadey ho jaaen
 Later Nadia somehow managed to escape from the clutches of those terrorists
 ladakiyon kii lagati he boli21veen sadi cabagdadi ke bazaar menjanwaron kii tarah insaanon kii boli lagati he
 There each girl is sold and bought for 50, 100, 150 dollars
 ye ladkiyaan or auraten, dushman gharon kii hoti hai, isiilie unhen bech diya jaataa he
 Nadia was broken on Kahranadiya is just 21 years old and she was also spoken in one such market of humans
 sau-do sau dollar main use bhi bech diya gaya tha
 After being sold, Nadia remained with her buyer owner for about three months
 or phir ek roj mauka milte hi kisi tarah jaan bachaa kar vahaan se nikal bhaagi
 Now it is safe so i can tell my story
 nadia ko uthaane se pehle iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ne uske chah bhaaiyon or maa ko maar daalaa tha
 Thousands of girls in the clutches of ISIS are not happy to leave ISIS clutches because they have seen with their own eyes that 5800 Yajidi women and girls like her are still in the possession of ISIS
 nadia unki bhi salaamati chaahati he ou untak madad pahunchaana chaahati he
 Rape told that after the capture of the characterless Mosul town, the Niswah town ISIS militants raped the four women
 lekin phir baad main unheen mahilaon par charitraheen hone kaa iljaam laga diya
 After which all four were produced in ISIS Sharia court
 sharia adaalat ne chaaron ko pathar maar kar maut kii sajaa dene kaa elaan kar diya, jiske baad chaaron auraton ko sangsar kar diya gaya
 How dangerous the ISIS terrorists who are buying and selling girls in Baghdadi market is rarely disclosed
 wo to nadia jaisi kuch yajidi ladkiyaan unke changul se kisi tarah batch nikaleen, tab kahin jaakar ye sach saamne aayaa
 Then it came to know how the ISIS terrorists who instruct women to remain in the curtains, are themselves being exposed and offended
 5000 logon ko kiya tha agavaais ke aatankwaadiyon ne agast 2014 main in ladakiyon ko unke puure parivaar ke saath agava kar liya tha
 Then these people of the Yazidi fraternity hid in the hills of Sinjar to escape from ISIS
 lekin aatankwaadiyon ne vahaan bhi unhen nahin choda or takreeban 5000 logon ko sangeenon ke saae main apane thikaane tak le gaye
 Out of these, 2000 people somehow escaped, but the three thousand people who got stranded, their lives became hell
 khaas kar un auraton or bacchon kii, jo iesas ke aatankwaadiyon kaa sabase aasaan shikaar thim
 Not one, many times girls were sold
 Actually, ISIS asked these Yazidis to convert to Islam, but when Yajidis were not ready for this, they were kidnapped, they were tortured
 phir to aisi hi hajaaron yajidi ladakiyon ko agava kar iesas ke jallaadon ne unhen apana sex gulam bana liya
 These terrorists would pick up whomever they wanted and would be arbitrary with them
 agar koi ladki iske liye taiyaar nahin hoti, to use goli maar dete
 Now, in such a situation, the ISIS terrorists have raped so many times and how many times, the girls who have become victims of them themselves cannot even be accurately accounted for
 lekin ye ladkiyaan bataati hai ki kis tarah iesas ke aatankwaadi unke saath jyaadati karne ke baad unhen aage amir logon ke haathon sex slave banane ke liye bech diya karte the
 And thus each one of the girls was sold for twenty times, kept plundered and getting angry
 maheenon tak tahkhaanon main band raheen ye masumek mahila iraqi patrkaar ne haal hi main iesas ke changul se chhot kar bhaag nikali aisi ladakiyon ko dekha or unka dard samajhane kii koshish kii
 When these girls narrated their tragedy, she was surprised to hear that
 lekin in tamaam kahaniyon main sabase dil dahalaanevaali kahani thi 12 saal kii ek aisi gumnaam yajidi ladki kii, jiske saath iesas ke jallaad maheenon tak rape karte rahe or julm dhaate rahe
 All such girls were kept in dark cellars and kept away from food and drink for several days
 peedit nahin fiter banakar ubareen ladkiyambagdadi ke aatankwaadi khaas taur par yajidi ladakiyon ke peeche pade hai
 ISIS has inflicted so much oppression on Yazidi girls that Rongte can stand up after hearing her story
 lekin tamaam julmo-sitam ke baavjood in ladakiyon ne haar nahin maani or ab bagdadi ke saath aar paar kii ladaai shuru kar di he
 The biggest fear of ISIS terrorists, the Lady Brigade, was laid on August 2014, when ISIS made the mistake of looting and ruining the Yazidi community hiding in the hills of Sinjar in Iraq
 uske baad se iraq or syria jaise mulkon main takreeban 10 hajaar ladkiyaan alag-alag ladi fiter brigade kaa hissaa ban kar iesas ke aatankwaadiyon se takaraa rahi hai, unase loha le rahi hai
 In August 2014, when ISIS began to step into Iraq, it was only the softest targets of the Yazidi fraternity that counted among its minorities
 lihaaja, in aatankwaadiyon ne chun-chun kar yajidiyon ko lootnaa or maarna shuru kar diya
 Fearing the ism's oppression, the community moved to the hills of Sinjar to save their lives, but ISIS did not stop pursuing them there and about 5000 people were kidnapped from here, including women and children
 There was also a large number
 ab yajidiyon ke paas do hi raste the yaa to iesas kii baat maan kar islam kubul karnaa yaa phir tadap-tadap kar maranaa
 But he did not give up hope and this is where the Yajidis' confrontation with ISIS began, which continued to grow with each passing day
 rihana bani preranaavhaa cobaniyon ne iesas ke khilaaf morcha khol rakhaa tha
 And Rihanna was one of these Kobani girls
 duble-patale or nate kad kii is ladki ne apane jite-ji aatankwaadiyon ke aise chakke chhudaae ki wo dekhte hi dekhte ek public figure ban gai
 According to a rough estimate, this girl alone put more than a hundred ISIS terrorists to death before she was killed at the hands of ISIS
 rihana kii shoharat kaa andaaza isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki haath main gan liye victory yani jeet kaa sin banaati uski is tasviir ko jahaan logon ne lakhon baar dekha or hajaaron baar twit kiya
 isis's fear of being killed at the hands of six girls, but ISIS has given the women a new impetus to fight against ISIS
 dekhte hi dekhte donon mulkon main alag-alag ladi brigade ne iesas ke chakke chhudaane shuru kar die
 In one such brigade, the YPJ overtook ISIS in Syria from many places occupied by it and killed hundreds of terrorists
 or ab haalat ye he ki parivaar kii jimmedaariyon se baahar nikal kar bullate pruf jacket pahane or haath main khaufnak aslhe liye ladi brigade kii ladkiyaan jahaan duniya bhar ke liye ek vismay or achraj kii kahani ban chuki hai, vahiin syria or iraq jaise mulkon kii ek aam tasviir

 Just four months ago in March, the unemployed youth ran towards the employment offices of their districts as soon as the Samajwadi Party (SP) government came to power in Uttar Pradesh
 is aas main ki nai sarkaar apane vaade ke mutabik berozegaron ko bhatta degi jisase mahangaai ke is daur main unki kadaki ku chha dur ho sakegi
 More than 10 lakh unemployed knocked in the employment offices of the state within two weeks of the result of the assembly elections
 lekin bhatta paane ke liye niyam-kanoonon kii bharmaar dekhakar berozegaar isse bidak gaye
 There was silence on employment offices
 nateeja ab sarkaar niyamon main dheel dekar berozegaron ko lubhaane kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 Who will get unemployment allowance? Actually, there was confusion about this question from the very beginning
 espi ne kaha tha ki sarkaar banane par vah 35 saal se adhik umr vaale har berozegaar ko 1000 ru
 Will give per month allowance
 par 15 may ko berogari bhatte ke liye jab niyam jari hue to puraa paridrishy hi badal gaya
 The government wrapped up the process of getting unemployment allowance in all the terms and conditions
 iske mutabik 30 se 40 varsh kii umr vaale vahi berozegaar bhatte ke yogya honge, jinhone is varsh 15 march ko espi sarkaar ke shapath lene tak apana panjikaran sevaayojan karyaalay main kara liya hoga
 Not only this, the income from all sources of unemployed person's family is Rs
 36,000
 vaarshik yaa isse kam honi chahie
 1100 crores for the allowance of nine lakh unemployed in the government in the budget
 kaa praavdhaan bhi kiya
 As soon as the manual was released, it was as if the hopes of the unemployed had receded
 phir sarkaar ne apane niyamon main sanshodhan kiya
 Those unemployed who were enrolled by April 15 were considered eligible for the allowance
 15 july tak pradesh ke sabhi sevaayojan karyaalayon main kul 55,095 berozegaron ne hi bhatte ke liye aavedan kiya jo sarkaar ke nirdhaarit lakshya kaa mahaj chah fisadi hi tha
 Associate Professor of Sociology Department at Jai Narayan Degree College, Dr
 vinod chandra kehete hai, ''ek ore to sarkaar yah dikhaa rahi he ki vah 9 lakh logon ko berogari bhatta dene ja rahi he lekin asaliyat yah he ki sarkaar ke paas aisa koi aankada nahin he ki uski sharton ke mutabik pradesh main bhatta paane ke liye yogya berozegaron kii sankhya kitni he?''apni mahatvakankshi yojana kaa hashr dekhte hue sarkaar ne ek baar phir niyamon main dheel di or 23 july ko aadesh jari kar 25 se 40 varsh kii umr vaale berozegaron ko bhi bhatta paane kaa hakdaar bana diya
 Not only this, now the unemployed people who have registered till 31 August will also be eligible for the allowance
 isse 24 july tak pradesh ke sevaayojan karyaalayon main aavedan karne waalon kii sankhya 73,362 tak pahunch gai
 Kailash Gupta (25), who lives in Alambagh, Lucknow, has been unemployed for the last four years after doing mcom
 ve bataate hai, ''asli berozegaar to vah he ki jo padhai puri karne ke baad rojgaar ke liye bhatak rahaa he
 "dinesh Pandey (30), who lives in Allahpur town of Ambedkarkaranagar, fits the government standards issued for unemployment allowances but will not be able to make allowances
" dinesh bataate hai, ''maine ambedarkar nagar ke sevaayojan karyaalay main march ke maheene main registration kara diya tha
 It was then told that the postcard attached to the registration form will be sent to the applicant's house after stamping the employment office, which will be the proof of registration, but after more than four months, no such postcard has come to me
 
 ''sevaayojan daftar main dinesh hi nahin, badi sankhya main berajagaar apana registration certificate paane ke liye bhatak rahe hai
 It is also necessary to mention here that a large number of registration forms submitted to the Ambedkar Nagar Employment Office were found lying on the roadside last month
 prashasan inaki jaanch kar rahaa he
 Senior BJP leader Kalraj Mishra says, "it is not permissible to apply all the conditions to get allowance
" isse berozegaar apane aap ko thaga mahasoos kar rahaa he
 "employment officers also do not describe these conditions as practical
 ek sevaayojan adhikari bataate hai ki agar kisi vyakti kii aay 36000 ru
 If it is an annual then how did he become unemployed first? The reality is that according to the conditions, most of the actual eligible people have not registered for allowances
 lakhanu ke sevaayojan adhikari pi
 K
 pundir bhi sweekaarte hai ki berogari bhatte ke aavedankartaaon ne farm ke saath jo kagajaat lagaae hai philhal unhen 'crosschek' karne kii koi vyavastha nahin he
 However, the government has made a strategy to employ unemployment allowance applicants to prevent any kind of rigging
 shram evam sevaayojan pramukh sachiv shailesh krishna bataate hai, ''isse keval vahi berozegaar bhatte ke liye aavedan karenge jo vaastaviktaa main kahin or kaam nahin kar rahe hon
 The government's decision to take work from the unemployed is being strongly opposed
 congress vidhanmandal dal ke netaa pradeep maathur kehete hai, ''bhatte kii evaj main berozegaron se kaam lenaa kisi bhi hisaab se jaij nahin he
 The BSP is the biggest attacker on the SP government regarding the format of unemployment allowance
 party vidhanmandal dal ke netaa or netaa pratipaksh swami prasad maury kehete hai, ''espi ne yuvaaon or berozegaron ko gumraah kiya he
 Has made fun of them
 koi bhi shikshit yuvak berozegaar ho saktaa he
 It is not rational to set the age limit for this
 sarkaar unheen berozegaron ko bhatta degi jinka registration 31 agast tak hoga, kya iske baad berogari khatm ho jaaegi?'' Several student leaders, including the professor, came forward to protest the lathi charge on girl students at Banaras Hindu University
 sabhi ne lathicharge kii kadi ninda karte huechatraonke paksh main apana mat rakhaa
 In this regard, Professor Balraj Pandey said that all the professors here are keeping silence under the Code of Conduct
 yahaan par criteria apni pagaar apni tankhaa apni sukh shanti he
 No professor wants to comment on what is happening in the university, as he is watching his operation
 prophessoron par aachaar samhita lagi hui he
 At the same time, alumni union leader Satendra says that for a long time the administration has been unable to accept that when the world changed, the BHU should have also changed, but it is imposing university thinking to the students and students not changing themselves
 
 biechayu ke purv chaatr vikaas kaa maananaa he ki banaras bavandar uniwarsity nahin he
 Politics is not happening here at all
 chaatrasangh nahin he, siyasat hone bhi nahin de rahe
 Even if politics is happening, it is not a bad thing
 agar sakaaratmak siyasat ho to acchhee baat he, lekin aisa nahin ho rahaa
 They are scaring the students
 ek din aisa aayega jab log inase darana chhod denge
 Senior journalist Nitin Rai said that such violence is completely opposite to Banaras
 pehle police ne laathiyaan chalaai jis kaa riection bacchon ne diya
 Purvanchal's soul is distressed that Durga Puja was going on that day

 unhone abhinetri ko dhamkee dene ke aaropon se inkaar kiya
 The magistrate granted bail in October last year to Sadhana, who appeared in the court of sadhana after Lakdawala filed a defamation suit against Sadhana

 The matter is also very big
 lalu prasad ke arajak bihar ko sushasit bihar main badalane kii pratigya lekar nitish kumaar maidan main utre the
 The public appreciated his honesty, commitment and fighting spirit
 unhen bihar kii satta saunp di
 Taking the slogan of good governance, Nitish Kumar became the keeper of Bihar
 araajaktaa or aparaadh ke khilaaf unhone morcha sambhala
 He got immense success and also got public affection
 nitish kumaar bihar ke sarvshereshth prashaskon main gine jane lage
 But there is a strange addiction in power, as much as the man tastes it, his desire grows more and more, this happened with Nitish Kumar
 unhone sochaa ki bihar main bijepi kii baisakhi ko phenkakar apni sarkaar banaai jaae
 Ego-filled Nitish Kumar left the BJP and killed the ax in his feet
 lok sabha chunaav main unhen munh kii khaani padi
 He tried to seek public sympathy by quitting the post of CM
 lekin uskaa bhi koi phayda nahin hua or ab unhone apane chir pratidwandvi lalu yadav kaa daaman pakad liya
 This is a terrible incident in Indian politics

 Bihar has just emerged from the hell of secrecy and crime and has many achievements to achieve
 lekin ab phir se nitish kumaar ne apane ahm ke kaaran use andheri surang main dhakelne kaa pehla kadam uthaa diya he
 He owed Lalu Yadav in the Rajya Sabha elections which he would have to repay with Sood
 lalu us mitti ke bane hue nahin hai ki phir se unke mitra ban jaaen
 He was in the process of making a mark in the state since the debacle in the Lok Sabha elections

 Obviously, new equations will be formed which will run till the Vidhan Sabha elections due next year
 apane chaatr andolan jamaane ke sakha kii sarkaar bachaane ke liye vah prayaas karenge or uski keemat bhi vasuulenge
 Bihar is now moving towards anarchy
 bijepi se kinaaraa karne ke baad nitish kumaar ne 18 mantralayon kaa kaamkaaj sambhala
 The administration declined and questions were raised over his claim of good governance
 ab unhone ek proxi siem banaakar nayaa daanv khelaa he
 One cannot believe that it is the same Nitish Kumar who used to talk about good governance, diligence and honesty till yesterday
 unke dimag main apni sarkaar bachaane or chunaav main vaapasi karne ke bare main kya he, yah to vakt hi batayega, lekin itnaa tay he ki bihar sushasan ke raste se bhatak gaya he
 Narendra Modi's wishes are now well known
 bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh samet kai netaaon ne bahut saaf sandesh logon tak pahunchaa diya he ki narendra modi unki party ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ho sakate hai
 It has many possibilities
 lekin bijepi ke bheetar or baahar donon jagah modi ko aalochanaon se do-chaar hona pad rahaa he
 On Saturday, Uddhav Thackeray targeted Narendra Modi in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana
 unhone likhaa, 'narendra modi kehete hai ki ve pradhanmantri banane kaa khwab nahin dekhte
 He should explain the same thing to other BJP leaders
 'uddhav ne likhaa, 'modi ne ek bachche ko samajhaate hue yah kaha he ki vah 2017 tak gujarat ke mukhyamantri bane rahenge
 It is very easy to explain to a small child, but how will they explain to the elders of their own party, who are moving ahead of each other in making them contenders for the post of Prime Minister
 'uddhav thakare ne kaha ki, 'bachche ko ek chocolate dekar shant kiya ja saktaa he, lekin raajnneetik khel main yah pintara kaam nahin karata
 If someone comes in National Politics, then obviously his dreams are high
 lekin bhartiya raajnneeti bahut mushkil he
 There are many ups and downs
 modi kii apni bijepi main hi modi ko lekar kai mat hai, isliye hi to unhen ab tak pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray also wrote that BJP has every right to choose its candidate
 lekin vartmaan sthiti aisi he ki shaadi kaa seoup taiyaar nahin he par duulhe kai taiyaar hai
 And many of them are not even entitled to it
 so sori:dekhen, kaise tutaa modi kaa sapanaudhav ne modi ko naseehat dete hue likhaa ki devgauda, chandrashekhar, rajeev gandhi or gujral ne kabhi pradhanmantri banane kaa khwab nahin dekha, lekin ve bane
 Dr
 manmohan singh ne bhi kabhi piem banane kaa nahin sochaa tha
 But he made a record of being Prime Minister for ten years
 dilli kii raajnneeti main jo ghode res se baahar hote hai, ve bhi vijeta hote hai
 Modi should learn something from history
 aksar aisa hota he aapkaa phone chori hone yaa khone ke baad uskaa sim card yaa iemai number badalakar chor uski pahchaan badal detaa he
 And because of this, the police also have a lot of trouble in finding your lost phone
 lekin ab sarkaar iskaa bhi ek samaadhaan lekar aane vaali he

 sansad satr ke baad doorsanchaar vibhaag mantri se is pranali kii shuruyaat ke liye sampark karegaa
 It should come into force next month
 sansad kaa maujuuda satr 26 july tak chalegaa
 The Department of Telecommunications in July 2017 tasked C-DOT to develop a 'central Equipment Identity Register' (CEIR) with the goal of reducing the incidence of fake mobile phones and theft

 The CEIR system will block all types of services on stolen or lost phones, even if the SIM card is removed or the IMEI number is changed

 He said that if this happens, it will be a memorable moment for him before taking his departure from ODI cricket
 afiridi ne kaha ki aise record plan karke nahin banaae jate hai
 If that day is yours and your confidence is beating, then it happens automatically
 unhone kaha ki agar sab kuch thik rahaa to or meraa khaas din rahaa to newjiland main main record phir se banane kii koshish karuunga
 Afridi is happy that a brilliant batsman like De Villiers has succeeded in setting a new record of fastest century
 lekin afridi ne is baat par andeh he ki jis jagah par vah batting karte hai vahaan centuri bananaa shaayad sambhav hi na ho
 Now they bat in lower order and it is easy for them to make 50 but century is tough

 Karnataka's victory will be no less than a semi-final before 2019 for the BJP after Gujarat's tough but victorious contest
 aane vaale samay main bijepi ko madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi utarana he
 The results of Karnataka will also impact here

 Jalandhar Assistant Commissioner of Police (west) RPS Sandhu said, "police have arrested and sent a case against a man named Jalandhar resident Atul Kumar on charges of sending jokes on Sardars through SMS
" ’ sandhu ne bataaya, ‘atul ne shikayatakarta narinder singh ke mobile par saradaaron par kendrit 15 chutkule bhej diye
 He opposed this, but Atul kept sending him continuously
 is bich narinder ke virodh ke baavjood atul ne use asaram kii ek aapattijanak tasviir bhi bhej di
 He told that after this Narinder Singh filed a complaint against Atul Kumar
 police ne iti adhinium tathaa bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 295 e ke tahat yah maamla darj kar kumaar ko giraftaar kar jail bhej diya gaya he
 The officer said that Narinder Singh has stated in his complaint that Atul has hurt Sikh sentiments by sending jokes against the chieftains and despite his opposition he (atul) sent him more jokes and objectionable pictures of Asaram
 isliye police ne atul ke khilaaf bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 295 e (dharmik bhaawanaaon ko aahat karne vaala) lagaaya he
 Asked if centering on Sardar and jokes of Santa Banta are common, is it reasonable to file a case and arrest, Sandhu said, "if a complainant comes and accuses the police of hurting religious sentiments If he gives a complaint and presents evidence, then the police will register a case
 ’duusari ore shikayatakarta narinder singh ne kaha ki atul ke esemes praapt hone ke baad usne uskaa virodh kiya lekin vah lagaataar bhejtaa rahaa or baad main asaram kii do ladakiyon ke saath ek tasviir bhej di
 He then got a case registered against Atul

 No joke should be against any religion

 The situation is that 28 thousand students were given coaching through this system, it cost Rs 18 crores from the government treasury, but not a single student got a place in PMT nor in PET

 The Edusat system has a list of students who have taken coaching here

 ' patidaar netaa hardik patel shanivaar ko patna main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par jamkar barase or aarope lagaaya ki unhone apane kurmi samaaj ke liye aaj tak kuch bhi nahin kiya
 Addressing the Patel Awareness Conference, Hardik Patel said that Nitish does not have any vision for the development of Bihar and is only shining his face
 hardik patel ne mukhyamantri par hamalaa karte hue yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki vah bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dilaane ko lekar bhi koi thos pahal nahin kar rahe hai
 Without naming Nitish, he compared him to a rotten mango and said that if a mango gets rotted in the mango basket, he should throw it out of the basket, otherwise all the mangoes will be spoiled
 hardik patel kaa sidhaa nishaanaa nitish kumaar par tha or vah sammelan main pahunche kurmi samaaj ke logon se kah rahe the ki nitish kumaar ne agar unke liye kuch nahin kiya he to unhen kurmi samaaj se baahar kar dena chahie
 Hardik also wondered how Nitish Kumar broke away from the Grand Alliance and re-aligned with the BJP? Hardik Patel said that though Nitish Kumar may have changed his ways, he himself is walking on his old path
 nitish kumaar se dushmani nahingauratlab he, disambar 2016 main hardik patel pehali baar jab patna aae the to us vakt mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne puri garmjoshi ke saath unka swaagat kiya tha or apane sarkari awaas par unke liye raatri bhoj kaa bhi aayojan kiya tha
 At that time Nitish was in the grand alliance and for this reason Hardik was also given VIP treatment
 haalanki, hardik ne kaha ki agar nitish kumaar ne apane raste badal liye hai to iskaa matlab yah nahin hota he ki unki or nitish kii dushmani ho gai he
 Disclosing the controversial remarks on PM Modi and Amit Shah, while urging the sub castes of the Kurmi community to get together, Hardik Patel also targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP national president Amit Shah in gestures
 hardik ne kaha ki gujarat vidhansabha chunaav se pehle unhone patel samudaay ke up jatiyon ko ek saath lekar aae the jisaki vajah se donon gundon ko gujarat main chunaav jeetne ke liye 1 maheene tak kaam karnaa padaa tha
 Clearly, Hardik Patel broke the modesty of the language and called the Prime Minister and Amit Shah a goon
 ajtak ne jab is kaarykram ke baad hardik patel se exclusive baatcheet kii or kaha ki kya vah apane is bayaan ko waapas lete hai to unhone kaha ki vah apane bayaan par puri tareeke se kaayam hai

 Rahul Gandhi has made a strong comeback after his return on leave and has emerged as a leader with strong intentions
 lekin bihar main rahul or congress bhavarjaal main hai
 Elections are to be held here in October and Rahul, Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar are in a tussle
 agar lalu or nitish kaa gathbandhan nahin hota he to congress donon main se kiske saath jaaegi, is sawaal se rahul jujh rah hai
 He has a third option of whether to contest alone for a long-term withdrawal
 rahul asamanjas main hai kyonki ek ore party kaaryakarta, khaskar yuva chaahate hai ki congress long turm vaapasi ke liye akeli lade
 They say that the Congress is at a loss due to its continuous alliance
 duusari ore rajya ke party netaa lalu-nitish kii peeth par savaar hokar apni-apni seat jeetne kii ummid main gathbandhan karnaa chaahate hai
 They say that the bjp's defeat in Bihar will bring back the opposition across the country and Modi's national wave will end
 or aisa tabhi sambhav he jab congress secular partiyon ke saath bihar vidhansabha chunaav main gathbandhan karti he
 Apart from this, the electoral history of the Congress is also bad
 pichley 2010 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaav main vah 243 siton main sirf chaar siten jeet pai thi
 Like previous occasions, in the Lok Sabha elections, under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi, the Congress had chosen Lalu instead of Nitish
 iske baavjood rahul gandhi ne us vakt nitish par zyada bharosa dikhaaya tha
 Bihar Congress President Ashok Chaudhary, considered Rahul's choice, has openly proposed to hand Nitish the leadership of a secular alliance in the state
 lekin vyaktigat rup se rajya congress ke netaa abhi bhi lalu ko zyada bharosemand maanate hai or chaara ghotaale main funsane ke baad lalu se samjhauta karnaa bhi aasaan hoga
 The first example of Congress leaders' hesitation is that Rahul Gandhi reportedly canceled his tour of Bihar this month

 In provocative remarks against India, Pakistan claimed on Tuesday that Jammu and Kashmir had never been an integral part of India and demanded a un-led referendum to know the wishes of the Kashmiri people
 pakistan ke bayaan se gussaye bharat ne ise gairajaruri bataaya
 During a discussion of the United Nations General Assembly, Pakistan's Permanent Mission diplomat Tahir Hussain Andrabi said, "jammu and Kashmir is not an integral part of India and it never was
" sanyukt raashtra main pakistan ke up sthaayee pratinidhi raja bashir taraar ne kaha, dakshin asia main jammu-kashmir ke logon ke khud faisla karne ke anany adhikaar ko suraksha parishad ke kai prastaavon main sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The United Nations agenda to end the colonization is incomplete without a settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute
 baharhaal, unhone kaha ki jammu-kashmir vivaad ke shantipurna hal ke liye patibaddh he jisase dakshin asia main chir shanti or sthirataa aegi
 In response to Pakistan's statement, Indian diplomat r Ravindran (first Secretary) said that the statement made by the Pakistani official on Jammu and Kashmir is irrelevant and absolutely irrelevant in the work of the committee
 bhartiya rajanyik aar ravindran ne kaha, main pakistan ke sammanit pratinidhi ko yah yaad dilaanaa chaahunga ki jammu kashmir bharat kaa abhinn hissaa he
 The Indian Constitution gives fundamental rights to all its citizens
 niyamit antaraal par hone vaale swatantra or nishpaksh chunaavon main bhaag lekar jammu kashmir ke logon ne apni ichha jaahir kii he
 Andrabi said the Indian diplomat made some nonsensical claims in his response
 unhone kaha ki suraksha parishad ke kai prastaav hai jisamen jammu kashmir ko vivaadit kshetra mana gaya he
 He said that these proposals said that the final solution of Jammu and Kashmir would be in accordance with free and fair referendum by the people in the presence of the United Nations
 andrabi ne kaha ki in prastaavon main saaf taur par kaha gaya he ki jammu kashmir main bharat dwaara karaae jane vaala koi bhi chunaav sanyukt raashtra kii maujuudagi main hone vaale swatantra or nishpaksh janamat sangrah kaa sthaan nahin le sakate
 The Pakistani diplomat said, several resolutions of the Security Council accepted the right of self-determination of the people of Jammu and Kashmir
 pichley 63 saalon se jammu kashmir ke logon ko aatmanirnay se rokna hamaari charchaa main bahut praasangik he
 He said that the Security Council resolution on Jammu and Kashmir is binding on both India and Pakistan

 On March 20, at the National People's Congress, Xi Jinping announced that he would be the country's lifetime president
 unhone shapath lee
 Now the question arises that what will be Xi's priorities in this second term? After Xi's presidential oath, is Xi going to see or see a big dream for China? Understanding Xi's world, what can be his priorities? 1-eliminate the difference of power and influence of America Weakening China's relations with its rival superpower country will be crucial to Xi's agenda
 2-doklam se lekar laddhakh tak china ke sarahadi buniyadi dhaanche ko majboot karnaa jari rahegaa or saath hi srilanka se lekar maldive tak se hind mahaasaagar main paith badhanaa bhi
 3-after cementing China's disputed military presence in the acquired islands of the South China Sea, the purpose of the belt and road is to buy and share the silence of ASEAN
 4-videshon main china kii aarthik paith ko or gaharaa karne ke liye shi pakistan se lekar afghanistan or europe tak buniyadi dhaanche kii apni is pahal par puraa jor denge
 5-the dream of Chinese leaders for a long time has been to bring Taiwan into its fold, which will also be an opportunity for Xi to leave behind Mao's legacy

 Pre-election surveys in November 2011 revealed that the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) would face an anti-incumbency wave, but no one could say who would occupy this vacant place
 dekhen UP chunaav par vistrut kaverejus vakt congress ne kaaphi suniyojit tareeke se rahul gandhi or unke mishan uttar pradesh ko kaamyaab banane ke liye rajnatik daanv chalaa tha
 After winning 21 Congress mps from the state in the last Lok Sabha election, the party's expectations were raised
 rahul ne is safalataa ko bhunaane ke liye badi satarkta se apane rajnatik dauron kaa kaarykram taiyaar kiya tha jisamen centre kii ore se milane vaale vishesh package aadi shaamil kiye gaye

 Parallel to this, Akhilesh was working equally to change the image of SP
 yahaan tak ki ve nae se nae model kii cycle lekar janata ke bich ja rahe the
 The party's manifesto promised free laptops to students
 party karyaalay main computer laga die gaye
 On these steps of Akhilesh, some old type of leaders were constantly shouting nose and eyebrow, 'will the party now run from the computer?' Akhilesh, unheard of, distributed tickets to professionals this time instead of muscle power

 With these steps, Poot's feet were visible in the cradle
 phir jaise hi chunaav prachaar kii shuruyaat hui, akhilesh ko sakaaratmak pratikriyaayein milane lageen
 The surprise of the election watchers was not limited when during campaigning Akhilesh emerged as the modern face of Uttar Pradesh and he occupied the place which till now only Rahul Gandhi was visible
 do daur ke matdaan ke baad aisa lagane laga jaise akhilesh ne congress kii haalat sudharne kii raah main sachmuch roda atka diya ho
 Three things can be counted as its effect
 pehali, rahul ne kaha ki ve sapa ko samarthan nahin denge
 Secondly, the Congress started a direct attack on Akhilesh, realizing that with his fist Muslim votes were slipping
 teesri, congress netaa digvijay singh ne kah diya ki agar congress rajya main sarkaar nahin bana saki to ve raashtrapati shashan ko praathamikta denge
 In response, Akhilesh became more vocal in replying to Rahul
 sapa ke is rajkumaar kaa udai is lihaaj se adbhut he ki 2009 loksabhaa upachunaav main firozabad seat se unki patni dimple ko raaj babbar ne haraaya tha
 Babbar, who was loyal to the SP, is now trusted by Rahul

 He conducted several surveys about the party's image
 party ke ek vidhayak kehete hai, ‘basapa ke khilaaf gusse kaa maahaul tha lekin saath hi yah dar tha ki yadi sapa waapas aa gai to gundaraj kaayam ho jayega
 After this, Akhilesh realized that he is fighting not only on the ground, but also on the level of thinking
 sapa ke itihaas main pehali baar icchhuk pratyaashiyon se aavedan patr bharne ko kaha gaya
 Akhilesh explains, 'we started the selection process early last year
 mere paas 4,000 se 5,000 aavedan aae
 After this Akhilesh, his uncle Ram Gopal Yadav and other senior leaders of the party interviewed the applicants
 ve bataate hai, ‘hamane unase poocha ki ve kaise mudde uthaaenge or unhen apni jeet kii kitni ummid he
 After this the list was sent to Netaji who took the final decision
 ’party kaa chunaav prachaar akhilesh ne sitambar, 2011 main 250 kimi kii cycle yatra se shuru kiya taaki logon ke bich party kaa chunaav chinh le jaaya ja sake or yuvaaon ko sangathit kiya ja sake

 ve bataate hai, ‘ham chaahate the ki hamaara chunaav prachaar nakaaratmak vichaar lekar logon ke bich na jaae, balki ummid jagaae
 His colleagues say that he had studied the propaganda of the parties in previous elections and had criticized the nda's slogan 'bharo Ho', especially in 2004, in response to the UPA slogan 'jai Ho'
 akhilesh kii prachaar style or rahul ke tareekon main kaaphi samanta he
 Both promote themselves with the help of professionals and party workers
 donon takanic premi hai or vikaas kii jumalebaji main bhi donon ek jaise hai
 When the Congress sought SP support on the nuclear deal in 2008, Akhilesh met Rahul at Deoria's PWD guest house

 Just here, the paths of both are separated
 pratapgarh main chaay kii dukaan chalaane vaale ek shaks kehete hai, ‘jab rahul kisaanon kii samasya par bolte hai to lagata he sikhaaya hua doharaa rahe hai
 When Akhilesh speaks, it seems that he is aware of the problem
 akhilesh saamaanya bhashaa bolte hai, rahul main abhi bachapanaa he
 'rahul raises both national and regional issues in his campaign while Akhilesh confines himself to local issues
 lakhanu ke congressi netaa surendra rajput kehete hai, ‘rahulji rashtriya netaa hai jabaki akhilesh kshetreey hai
 Akhilesh is the gutka (pocket) version of our leader
 ’ saath hi yah bhi jod dete hai ki ‘gutka sanskaran hameshaa zyada bikate hai
 'the path of sp's prince seems even easier as compared to Congress because there is a cadre supporting him in his party
 bheed main ve swaabhaavik or saamaanya rahete hai
 When he took the Kranti Rath Yatra in 215 assembly constituencies between September and January, he was constantly talking to the people, whether his hands were shaking in the crowd greeting or typing the message on blackberry, in this 9,000 km journey

 He whispered to the person sitting next to him, 'that betariya will be of Kannauj' (kannauj is the constituency of Akhilesh)
 phir jab baap-bete mil jaaen to kahana hi kya
 On one hand, Mulayam Singh is attacking Mayawati and Akhilesh is challenging Rahul's youthful image
 lekin akhilesh bakhubi samajhate hai ki party ke bade netaa unki baat sirf isliye maanate hai kyonki unke peeche unke pita hai
 This hero of the next generation of socialists graduated from University of Mysore may speak fluent English, but always prefers Hindi
 angreji ke samachar channelon par unase ankar jab angreji main sawaal poochhate hai, tab bhi ve hindi main hi jawaab dete hai
 Everyone tries to grab the credit for good ideas
 sapa ke purv netaa amar singh kehete hai, ‘maine hi suzav diya tha ki akhilesh ko rajya ikai kaa adhyaksh banaaya jaae taaki party kii angreji virdohi or computer virdohi chhavi badali ja sake

 shahid kapur kii 'udata punjab' sensor main atak gai he
 This film made in Punjab on the condition of drugs, the film censor board had suggested some cuts due to the many abuses
 use in gaaliyon ko lekar aapatti thi or ek-do seens ko tone down karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 The film is directed by Abhishek Chaubey and also stars Alia Bhatt, Diljit Dusanjh and Kareena Kapoor Khan in addition to Shahid
 kahaan he gadabadahaalanki khabaron main kaha ja rahaa he kisensor bordake sadasyon main hi matbhed tha
 However, it is not like that
 agar sutron kii maane to film ko chaar sadasyon or ek aaro ne dekha
 There is a tremendous use of abuses in the film and the board members gave figures ranging from 70 to 100 abuses and asked for their removal
 board gaaliyon ko hataane ke maamle main ekamat he, lekin antar vaali baat sirf inaki sankhya ko lekar he
 Sources reveal that there is no difference of opinion about the film, the difference is only about the number of abuses
 yahi nahin film main ek gaanaa he jismendrugs ko gloriphikia gaya he auki ek murder seen bhi he jise kuch tone down karne kii salaah di gai he
 The arguments given by the language of the youth told that Udta Punjab has Chu # $ & # , Hara # Ja # , Ga # , Maad # $ # ! # , f $, Gash $ &, Lu $ # ! And there is a glut of abuses like sister # $$, although the team attached to the film argues that the film uses the language of the youth of Punjab
 jis vajah se is tarah kii bhashaa he
 Apart from this, the censors have also objected to the scene of Shahid Kapoor urinating on the audience
 haalanki sutara kehete hai ki film main punjab main drugs ke kaarobaar ko lekar kai tarah kii aisi chijen bhi dikhaai gai hai jinase bevajahpunjab kii chhavikharaab hoti he
 Danger for the film The members of the film censor board submitted the report with their suggestions, so the film team decided to go directly to the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT) regarding their case
 haalanki yah bhi ek maamla rahaa he ki jo bhi filmein epasieti se paas hokar aati hai, vah bahut hi kam safal ho paati hai
 We can also see its record in the case of films released in the recent past
 masalan, jai gangaajal, lav games, mastijade or kya kool hai ham
 There is also a question that if the social issue is to be raised and the issue is to be taken among the public, then does not such a lot of abuse and such scenes restrict its access

 On this issue, Arvind Kejriwal has made a press conference and has made serious allegations against the Modi government, BJP and Lieutenant Governor of the Center

 Kejriwal said that the bjp-led government has been troubled by the good works of the Aam Aadmi Party
 kejariwal ne press conference main kaha, 'bijepi ke netritv vaali centre sarkaar ne adhisuchana isliye jari kii he, kyonki ve AAP kii sarkaar dwaara kiye gaye achche kaam se pareshaan ho gaye hai
 'kejriwal said,' Money is taken for appointment and transfer of officers and the notification was issued because their government has stopped it
 ' unhone kaha, 've (BJP) dilli main adhikariyon ke tabadale or tainaati kaa adhikaar chaahate hai, taaki ve apane logon ko dilli main tainaat kar saken
 'lieutenant Governor is just a face: Kejriwal Kejriwal has accused the Lieutenant Governor of not paying attention to development related issues,' His entire focus is on the transfer and appointment of officers
 ' unhone kaha, 'hamaari uparajyapal se koi sidhi ladaai nahin he
 He is a face who is being given instructions from the Prime Minister's Office

 Najeeb Jung, Kejriwal responsible for 'crisis': Congress Attributing Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung for the 'crisis', the Congress said that both have crossed their boundaries and have not followed the prescribed rules of governance
 congress saansad piel puniya ne jammu main samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘shashan bahut hi samvedansheel mudda he, log nahin jaanate hai ki koun faisle karata he, kyonki yah ek cheharaavihin cheez he

 ’puniya ne kaha, ‘sankat ke liye ve donon jimmedaar hai kyonki unhone apni simaaon ko laangha he
 The BJP, which is in power at the Center, also does not have a good role
 bijepi ne mudde par santulit rukh nahin apanaaya
 The Left parties criticized the notification, while the left parties supported the AAP government on the Central notification detailing the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant Governor, saying that the central government should resolve the issue through 'cooperative federalism' instead of 'forced centralization' 
 sipiem paulitte beuro sadsy brunda karaat ne kaha, ‘makapa dilli ke liye purna rajya ke darje kii himaayat karti he
 In the current framework, the Center and its representatives should resolve issues through collaborative federalism rather than the current approach of forced centralization

 Dasgupta said, 'this is not right
 yah galat he
 It is against the constitution

 'it is noteworthy that in the notification, the Center has supported the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi Najeeb Jung and made it clear that it is not mandatory for Jung to consult Chief Minister Kejriwal on issues like appointment of bureaucrats

 ankhen hamaare sharir kaa sabase mahatvapurn hissaa hoti hai
 Eyes fill our life with light

 3
 ankhon kii eksrasij karen:ankhon kii roshni or anya samasyaon se bachane ke liye jaruri he ki aap niyamit rup se ankhon kii eksrasij karen
 Exercising for at least 25-30 minutes a week can prevent many eye problems
 4
 Blink the eyelids: When using a computer, mobile or TV, do blink the eyelids in between
 aisa karne seankhon main sujananheen aati saath hi isse ankhon par zyada strain bhi nahin padataa he
 5
 kam roshni main kaam naa karen:kam roshni main padhane yaa tivi dekhne se ankhon par bahut bura asar padataa he
 Due to excessive strain on the eyes, the eyes quickly start feeling tired
 isse ankhon kii roshni par bhi asar padataa he
 So avoid working in low light as much as possible
 kehete hai siyasat main jab muddon kii dhar mand pad jaati he tab sahanubhuti hameshaa kaam aati he, aise main jail main band lalu yadav ko jab jamaanat nahin mili to vina vakt ganvaae lalu kaa kunba ab unki raajnneetik viraasat ko bhunaane nikal padaa he, jisamen samvednaa bhi he or mudde bhi
 The electoral movement has started increasing
 lalu bihar kii raajnneetik patal se gaayab he
 In such a situation, Lalu's absence does not overwhelm the party, so Rabri took command and forwarded her two sons Tejashwi and Tej Pratap, in the name of sympathy in the name of sympathy among the people
 is samay bhale hi desh ke paanch rajyon main chunavi siyasat se garmai ho par bihar main lalu kii gairmaujuudagi nai siyasat ko janm de rahi he
 Now Lalu's sons are not only ready to fill his place but the family is busy turning Lalu's sentence into a chance
 lalu ranchi kii jail main band hai par unke prachaar abhiyaan main koi kami nahin he
 Rabri is holding rallies in the name of Parivartan rally in Bihar, but on the pretext of this rally, Lalu has given the command of politics to his sons
 buudhvaar ko jab lalu kaa ye kunba rohtas ke kochas main parivartan raily ke liye niklaa to koshish thi lalu kii kami ko puraa kar diya jaae
 On the way to the road, Rabri Devi and her sons tried the same hanging blows which were Lalu's special style
 dhol-nagaade gaaje-baaje or jagah-jagah kaaryakartaaon ke haathon abhinandan
 Somewhere the elder son Tej Pratap is descending among the people, and somewhere the younger son is meeting the Tejaswi workers
 kahin naach-gane waalon kaa intjaam he to kahin ye parivaar maare gayi kaaryakarta ko shradhanjali de rahaa he
 Rabri sits on the stage with her two sons, in front of an enthusiastic crowd, both sons are greeted so that the recognition of Tejashwi among supporters and activists is accepted as a serious leader and entitled to the father's legacy, which Tejashwi is cashing in on
 
 tejasvi yadav bhaashan lalu or bheed se jodakar dete hai
 Tejaswi said to the people here, 'my father used to say, son, whenever there is disappointment, go among your boss, there you will get strength, you will get energy
 mere maalik aap log he
 Father is in jail but i am in your midst
 'tejasvi chaara ghotaale main pita ko hui jail ko lekar logon ke bich jate hai
 Lalu Yadav claims not because of the jail scam but because of giving voice to the poor-dalits and Muslims, and if this is a mistake, his family will make this mistake again and again
 tejasvi ne kaha, '1995 main chaara ghotaalaa kaa maamla darj hua par ye to 1975 se chal rahaa tha
 My father took out the case
 41 exiaar kiya
 But he was implicated
 'lalu or sahanubhuti ke baad tejasvi nitish ke khilaaf barasate hai, 'kahaan se sushasan
 Bihar has the highest crime and maximum corruption
 janm-praaanpatr banaao yaa mrityu praaanpatr, bina 500-1000 diye kaam hi nahin hota
 Rabri Devi speaks Lalu to the people from the stage
 unhe fansaane kii baat kahati hai or phir nitish or bijepi par hamalaa bolti hai
 Rabri's speech addresses both BJP and JDU by different names
 rabari ke shabdon main bijepi ravan he to nitish kansa lekin ye naam unhone kyon diya iskaa khulaasa nahin karti
 Actually it is the launch of sons as well as the litmus test of Lalu
 bihar main is samay lalu apni takat congress ko dikhaane par amada hai taaki gathbandhan par vichaar kar rahi congress unki takat ko nazarandaaj naa kar sake
 This effort is also to take the legacy of the father on the second generation and at the same time it is also being taken care that if Lalu does not leave the prison, then the workers too could not be disappointed

 He said, 'the survey has revealed that 30 percent of the houses were acquired through corrupt means
 ’ kalam ne bacchon se kaha ki unamem apane mata-pita kii aay ke strot ke bare main sawaal karne kaa saahas hona chahie or unhen ‘bhrasht dhan’ se kharidi gai car main safar karne se inkaar kar dena chahie
 He said that it can be a solution to eradicate corruption
 yah nagpur kii garm dopaher thi
 Activist Arun Ferreira, who studied at St
 Xavier's College, was waiting for a colleague at the station
 tabhi unhen 15 logon ne gher liya or dhakke markar ek car main daalkar le gaye
 On the way, he was beaten and later told that the anti-naxal Cell of Nagpur has detained him
 duusare din desh ke akhabaaron kii ahm khabar thi- 'desh kaa bada naksali giraftaar
 Arun was charged with a total of 10 charges, including being a member of the banned Communist Party of India (maoist)
 puure 4 saal 8 maheene tak jail main rahane ke baad vah jamaanat par jail se baahar aae
 No charges were proved against him until two years after his bail and he was eventually acquitted in each case
 ab ve baahar hai, par jindagi kitni saamaanya he, unheen se puuchhie
 He, who has spent 4 years and 8 months in jail, is not aware of how normal he will be now, having suffered terrible torture, abusive speech and slow trial in egg cell
 arun ne jail main vakt kaatane ke liye kitabon kaa sahaara liya or scaching kii puraani hobbi ko vistaar diya
 He studied human rights from behind bars
 vahaan rahete hue bhi padhane or arjeet karne ke liye sangharsh kiya
 Shortly after coming out, he wrote a book using those sketches - 'colors of the Cage'
 alef book company se prakashit is kitaab main unhone apane activism, giraftaar, torchar, bel milane ke turant baad hui giraftaar se lekar bedaag nikalne tak ke safar kaa tafasil se byoraa diya he
 This is not a common prison diary of an inmate
 pulisia taur-tareekon or nyaay vyavastha par sawaal karata ek majboot dastavej bhi he
 Ferreira knows what color of bars is
 hamane unase jaanane kii koshish kii, unki jindagi ke bare main, bharat kii jelon ke bare main or nyaay vyavastha par unki raay ke bare main
 Read the conversation with him: How much confidence is left in the judicial system of your country after 4 years and 8 months in jail and then acquitted in all cases? Ferreira: i do not know if using the word 'faith' would be right for this 
 sachai yah he ki bhale main lambey samay tak jail main rahaa lekin mujhe saare aaropon se mukti mili or mujhe reeha kiya gaya
 At the same time, there are many cases where the police have also framed the case on false grounds, as happened in the case of Binayak Sen and Seema Azad
 ye log apana trial teji se chalavane or jaldi bel paane main kaamyaab rahe lekin inhen doshi bhi qaraar diya gaya
 i cannot answer the question whether i believe in judicial or not
 isse acha main yah kahana pasand karuunga ki yah system nyaay nahin de paata he
 What is justice in your opinion? Ferreira: That's a big question
 main nyaay ko criminal justise sens main nahin dekhtaa hum
 i see justice as social justice
 samanta kii saamaanya avadharana kaa baari gairbarabari vaale samaaj main koi matlab nahin he
 Most of the injustice is done by rich or powerful corporate people, but no one sees this injustice
 jab tak amiron or takatvaron kii ore se kiye ja rahe anyaay ko nahin pahachaanaa jayega, tab tak garibon-kamajoro ko nyaay nahin milegaa
 Even when any of the deprived sections raise their voice against the system, they are captured and put in jail
 aapane apni kitaab main likhaa he ki jail se baahar nikalne ke baad bhi aapako dar rahegaa ki 'big brother ij watching you'
 Is something like this happening to you right now? Ferreira: When i came out on the vine, i had to talk to the local police every day
 yah ek saamaanya si cheez he
 But after my acquittal from all the cases, no such incident (in relation to 'big Brother is Watching You') has happened
 police or intelegence agenciyaan aise logon se poochtacha jarur karti hai, jinase main apane activism ke dauraan miltaa hum
 Even the organization i am associated with is investigated
 jail main naksali gatividhiyon ke aropiyon or duusare aropiyon ke bich police kya koi bhedbhaav karti he? police ke kaam karne ke tareeke or sawaal poochne ke tareeke main kya antar hota he? kya aapako lagata he ki police ne torchar karne ke apane 'alikhit' kanoon bana rakhe hai?ferera:bharat main police castady main poochtacha ke dauraan torchar karnaa ek aam baat he
 Although this word is not mentioned anywhere in the law, it is still recognized in our country
 iskaa matlab yah he ki police waalon ko puure mahakme or senior afasaron kaa samarthan hasil hota he
 Ordinary prisoners are tortured to extract evidence, such as 'where have you hid the weapon you killed'
 lekin jin par raajnneetik kaidi yaa aatankwaad ke aarope hote hai, unhen sajaa dene, unke samaaj ko chup karaane or bhedbhaav ke makasad se torchar kiya jaataa he
 As happens with Muslim accused
 meraa maananaa he ki police ko andruni taur par torchar karne kii vidhiyon ke bare main training di jaati he
 Even foreign agency such as the CIA and Mossad would have taken help from it
 naksali hamalon main desh ke sainik bhi maare jate hai
 How do you see these attacks? Ferreira: i do not justify any retaliation
 main maanata hum ki aisi hinsa state kii ore se kii jane vaali hinsa kaa jawaab hota he
 Do you think that in the country and Maharashtra (where you were in jail), the governance has improved after the formation of the BJP government? centre or rajya donon kii sarkaar sampradayik dange ko rokane main naakaam rahi he, balki aise maamalon par pardaa daalane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Did you decide to write a book in prison, as you described the aspects of prison life with the help of sketches? Ferreira: No, i used to sketch timepass and hobby in prison
 jail main rahete hue maine apane sketch publish karwaane ke bare main sochaa tha lekin apane kaidi jivan ke bare main kitaab likhane kaa vichaar man main nahin tha
 Are you still working for backward, deprived, dalit and tribal people or are you also looking into the case of accused Naxalites
 ferera:meraa activism mumbai shahar main jari he
 The aim is to help the underprivileged
 is desh main zyaadaatar vanchit log garib, dalit or alpsankhyak he
 So yes i am continuing my work and yes i am also helping to get the jailed inmates out of jail on charges of being a Naxalite
 is kitaab ko likhte hue aapako dobaaraa un sari chizon se guzarana padaa hoga, jail se baahar aakar waapas apni jindagi ko dobaaraa shuru karnaa kitna mushkil tha aapke liye?ferera:haa, is dauraan mujhe un saare anubhavon se guzarana padaa
 But it was good and it also helped connect it to the truth
 paanch saal tak jail main rahane ke baad or samaaj main waapas aane par life main kai edjastment karne hote hai
 It takes some time to get life back on track
 main sochataa hum ki aisa jari hi rahegaa, iske baar main maine apane kitaab ke aakhri chapter main likhaa he
 Do you believe that inmates change by being in prison, based on prison experience? Ferreira: Yes, a prisoner does change in prison
 magar yah badlaav aisa nahin he ki jail jaakar vyakti main sudhaar aa jaae or vah pehle se acha insaan ban jaae
 Rather, this change is such that a person becomes more afraid of the state by going to jail, or he learns how to get rid of the law without getting caught by crime
 yani uske andar se kanoon kaa dar hi khatm ho jaataa he

 haalanki yah pataa chalaa he ki peedita kathith taur par 2011 se varun kumaar ke khilaaf maamla darj karaane ke liye sangharsh kar rahi thi
 The complaint was finally filed after a court order
 ek police adhikari ne kaha, ‘varun kumaar pehle ambedkar nagar police thane main tainaat tha
 He is absconding at this time, efforts are on to nab him

 agar koi peeche hataa he to wo hamaari sahyogi party he
 50-50 on the agreement
 raut ne yah bhi kaha ki 145 kaa number he to bijepi sarkaar bana le
 On the other hand, BJP sources are claiming that the blue print of the Maharashtra government has been prepared
 iske mutabik maharashtra main bijepi-shivasena kii saajha sarkaar banegi or devendra fadanvis puure 5 saal ke liye mukhyamantri rahenge
 At the same time, there can be two Deputy Chief Ministers, one of which will be of Shiv Sena and one of BJP
 sutron kaa kahana he ki shivasena kuch malaaidaar padon kii maang kar sakati he
 She can also ask for independent charge of the Minister of State at the Center

 Rahul Gandhi will try to connect farmers with Congress on the anniversary of this shootout
 kya jiesti par congress khalanaayak ban gai he
 The country is going through a serious phase
 ek tex pranali ko badal kar nai tex pranali ko lagu kiya ja rahaa he
 Like the old system, the purpose of the new system is only to collect taxes
 aise main kendra sarkaar ise aazaadee ke jashn kii tarah kyon manaa rahi he? yah sawaal congress netaa manish tiwari ne GST midnite conklev ke manch par modi sarkaar se poocha ha
 At the same time, the Modi government has claimed that new India will emerge from GST
 kendra sarkaar ne twitor kaa sahaara lete hue bataaya he ki use ummid he ki jiesti se aane vaale dinon main desh kii arthvyavastha ko phayda hoga
 The government has claimed that these changes will be seen from GST
 # gstfornewindiakyom jaruri tha gst?modi sarkaar ne saaf kiya he ki usne kyon turant jiesti ko lagu karne kaa faisla liya he
 According to the government, 5 important 1 after GST is implemented
 puure desh ko ekikrut bazaar banane ke liye(kaaman neshnal market)
 2
 VAT kii khaamiyon ko dur karne ke liye GST hua lagu, aasaan or digital hoga kaarobaari tex dena
 3

 5

 According to the central government, these changes due to GST will lead to the emergence of a new India
 pradhanmantri modi pehle bhi new india kii baat kah chuke hai
 At the same time Manish Tiwari has raised the question that the government is fully prepared to protect the new data collected due to the change in business after GST? Outside the education-health GST, the central government has provided these two important services to the common man Is excluded from the purview of GST
 in donon sevaaon par sarkaar tex nahin legi
 But this does not mean that education and health services will not be expensive in the country after the implementation of GST
 bharat main in donon sevaaon main bade sudhaar kii jarurat he
 While the central government's challenge is to improve the level of education in the country, it has to make an effort to strengthen the country's poor healthcare
 lihaaja, in donon kshetron main bade nivesh kii jarurat ke saath-saath in kshetron ko bhi bazaar ke hawaale karne kii jarurat he
 In such a situation, after the implementation of GST, the cost of businessmen in both the regions is expected to increase
 aise main desh main behatar shiksha or swasthya sevaayen mahangi ho sakati hai
 Education and health services expensive? Tax reform will affect companies doing business in education and health sector
 skool ke liye kaagaj, kitaab, computer ityadi ke saath-saath aspataal main eks-re or anya mashiinon ke saath-saath dawa banane vaali companiyaan tex ke daayre main hongi
 Therefore, the increase in prices in these areas will make school education and hospital treatment expensive
 lihaaja, modi sarkaar ko manish tiwari ke sawaal ke jawaab ke alaava yah bhi saaf karnaa hoga ki kya desh main shiksha or swasthya kshetra main bhi sabase bade sudhaar kii jarurat he? yadi sarkaar zyada se zyada tex vasuulana chaahati he or aane vaale dinon main shiksha or swasthya manhagaa ho jayega to kya desh main utakrishth shiksha ke saath-saath behtareen swasthya sevaayen di jaaengi? aam aadmi ke lienu indiabehatar shiksha or swasthya sevaaon ke jariye udai ho saktaa he
 With the tsunami of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP has recorded a record victory in Uttarakhand

 jharkhand kaa prabharee banaaya
 Gave significant responsibility in UP
 agar mukhyamantri kii jimmedaari milegi to uske liye bhi taiyaar hoon
 There are a large number of devotees of Satpal Maharaj within Uttarakhand and within the country who always stand in his support
 satpal maharaj ke pita yogi raaj paramsant shri hans ji maharaj or mata jagat janani rajeshwari devi bhi dharm guru hi the
 But Satpal Maharaj is also attached to politics
 wo lagaataar congress se jude rahe or 1991 main rail rajya mantri ke taur par bhi centre kii congress sarkaar main kaam kiya
 But currently they are with BJP

 The opposition of Shiv Sena, which maintains its 'karmabhoomi' even to Maharashtra, may be justified, but their work today is grossly condemnable

 i have not been a huge fan of IIT Mumbai graduate engineer Sudhindra Kulkarni, because i do not know him very much

 He also claimed to have done a sting which ran across all TV channels

 Kulkarni was also arrested in 2011
 mujhe aaj bhi kulkarni kaa ek tivi channel par diya gaya intervyuu yaad he jisamen unhone kaha tha ki yadi sansad main ho rahe aise kisi kaam ko ujagar karne ke liye unhen jail bhi janaa pade to vah taiyaar hai
 His expressions were showing full devotion
 ho saktaa he, yah meraa najariya ho, lekin mujhe aisa hi prathit hua tha
 What the Shiv Sena did today, the man of weak heart either did not go to that program or after waiting till evening could have saved so much courage that he would have done the same thing as planned, in the fear of the arrogant people
 lekin, sudhindra kulkarni ne meri soch ko sahi sabit karte hue apane sankalp ko puraa kiya yani pakistan ke purv videsh mantri khurshid mahmud kasuri kii kitaab ke vimochan kaarykram ko mumbai main sampann karaayaa
 With the help of his morale, Kulkarni sahab really gave a befitting reply to the entire Shiv Sena

 And while giving the verdict on the steps and opinions of the then Congress government, the High Court had said that if the motive of these leaders were to take bribe, then they would not get stinged

 i would like to remind all of you that Kulkarni has been a BJP MP and his name was also mentioned in the scandal of note-blowing in Parliament
 2008 ke is maamle ko ham or aap 'cash for vot' ke naam se jaanate hai
 The Congress government was accused by lawmakers of waving notes in Parliament to buy mps to vote in their favor
 unhone ek sting karne kaa daawa bhi kiya jo tamaam tivi channelon main chalaa bhi
 It is said that the same Kulkarni sir was the brain behind the sting operation
 bijepi ke diggaj netaa or purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi or laalkrishna adwani ke bhaashan bhi kulkarni likhaa karte the
 Although there was no concrete evidence to bribe the parliamentary committee set up to investigate the Cash for Vote case, but in 2009 the case was handed over to the police for investigation
 2011 main kulkarni ko giraftaar bhi kiya gaya tha
 i still remember Kulkarni's interview on a TV channel in which he said that if he had to go to jail for exposing some such work happening in Parliament, he was ready
 unke haav-bhav puri nishtha darsha rahe the
 It may have been my point of view, but i felt so
 aaj shivasena ne jo kiya, kamjor dil kaa aadmi yaa to us kaarykram jaataa hi nahin yaa phir shaam tak intjaar ke baad itnaa saahas bachaa paata ki uddand logon ke bhay ke bich vahi kaam karata jisaki yojana rahi ho
 But, Sudhindra Kulkarni justified my thinking and fulfilled his pledge i

 apane manobal ke sahare kulkarni sahab ne vaaki puri shivasena ko karaara jawaab diya

 or tatkaaleen congress sarkaar ke kadamon or raay se itar faisla sunaate hue hoicourt ne kaha tha ki agar in netaaon kaa makasad ghoose lenaa hota, to ve sting nahin karavaate
 After this decision, Kulkarni sent to Tihar Jail came out
 phir unke is kadam ne unhen vijeta ke rup main prastut kiya he
 i got convinced by Kulkarni ji
 shivasena ne kuch hi din pehle pakistani gazal gayak gulam ali kaa kaarykram radd karne par majaboor kar diya tha
 The government of Maharashtra was still a failure and still failed
 sarkaar main shivasena kii bhi bhagidaari he or kaarykram ko manjuuri milane ke baad party kaa aisa rukh sirf yahi dikhaa rahaa he ki party bijepi se apana swaarth saadhane main lagi he
 After the defeat of BJP in the assembly elections (I am saying defeat for not getting more seats), Shiv Sena is doing this type of action which causes BJP government to face the situation of Assam
 yahi nahin, centre main piem narendra modi par aajkal shivasena khub hamale kar rahi he
 This is the same PM Modi whom party supremo Bala Saheb Thackeray used to like and the party always supported him
 aise tamaam maukey aae hai jab shivasena, rajya or khaas taur par mumbai main apane ko sarkaar se upar kii hasti sabit karne kaa prayaas karti rahi he
 Today it also becomes relevant to narrate the incident when BCCI officials had to meet Shiv Sena Supremo Bala Saheb Thackeray and ask for permission for the match between India and Pakistan
 kaha jaataa he ki unase anumati milane ke baad yah match ho paaya tha
 Even then it was a matter of embarrassment for the country and the state government and still is today
 sawaal to tab yahi mere zahan main uthaa ki yadi match galat tha to kyon ijaajat di
 Then why did the BCCI people go for permission
 kya thakare sahab sarkaar the

 Shiv Sena is also involved in the government, and after approving the program, such a stand of the party is showing only that the party is engaged in selfishness from the BJP
 vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi se mili haar ke baad (zyada siten na paane ko main haar kah rahaa hum) shivasena is prakaar kii harakat kar rahi he jisase bijepi kii sarkaar ko asamans kii sthiti kaa saamana karnaa pade
 Not only this, the Shiv Sena is doing a lot of attacks on PM Narendra Modi at the center these days
 yah vahi piem modi hai jinhen party supremeo bala sahab thakare kaaphi pasand kiya karte the or party ne hameshaa jinka saath diya
 There have been many occasions when the Shiv Sena has been trying to prove itself as a top figure in the state and especially in Mumbai
 aaj vah vakya bataanaa bhi praasangik ho jaataa he jab bharat or pakistan ke bich match ke liye bisisiai ke adhikariyon ko shivasena supremeo bala sahab thakare se mulaakaat kar match karaane kii anumati maangani padi thi
 It is said that the match was held after getting permission from him
 tab bhi yah desh or rajya sarkaar ke liye sharmindagi kaa vishay tha or aaj bhi he
 The question then arose in my mind that if the match was wrong then why was it allowed
 phir bisisiai vaale kyon ijaajat lene gaye the
 Was Thakre saheb government? tippaniyan Kulkarni also made the same mistake that he had gone to get 'permission' and permission was not granted
 ve bataa rahe hai ki kaarykram ke ek din pehle vah unase milane gaye the or charchaa kii thi
 Kulkarni already knows what is the way of opposition of Shiv Sena
 aapako yaad dilaate hai shahrukh khan kii film kaa jis prakaar virodh kiya gaya tha or vahi ek samay tha jab sarkaar ne apni manshaa ke saath-saath jameen par bhi yah dikhaaya ki vah jo chaahe karvaa sakati he or kanoon se bada koi nahin he
 The film was released and went on
 shivasena kii soch kii karaari haar hui thi
 i believe it is clear that if the government had the will, it would not have been a shameful incident
 lekin rajya kii devendra fadanvis sarkaar bhale hi ghatana ke baad lambi baaten kare lekin jameen par vah naakaam hi sabit hui he

 Today it also becomes relevant to narrate the incident when BCCI officials had to meet Shiv Sena Supremo Bala Saheb Thackeray and ask for permission for the match between India and Pakistan
 kaha jaataa he ki unase anumati milane ke baad yah match ho paaya tha
 Even then it was a matter of embarrassment for the country and the state government and still is today
 sawaal to tab yahi mere zahan main uthaa ki yadi match galat tha to kyon ijaajat di
 Then why did the BCCI people go for permission
 kya thakare sahab sarkaar the
 The comments kulkarni ne bhi yahi galati kii ki ve 'ijaajat' lene gaye the or ijaajat nahin mili
 They are telling that he went to meet them a day before the program and discussed
 kulkarni ji to pehle hi jaanate hai ki shivasena kaa virodh kaa tarika kya rahata he
 Remind you the way Shahrukh Khan's film was opposed and there was a time when the government showed its intention as well as on the ground that it can do whatever it wants and there is no bigger than law
 film relies bhi hui or chali bhi
 The thinking of Shiv Sena was defeated
 meraa to maananaa saaf he ki yadi sarkaar kii ichhashakti hoti to yah desh ko sharmasaar karne vaali vaardaat nahin ho paati
 But even though the Devendra Fadnavis government of the state may talk long after the incident, it has proved to be a failure on the ground
