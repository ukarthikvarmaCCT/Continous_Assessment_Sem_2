 The drama of power resumed in Karnataka took a new turn on Sunday when its chief minister BS Yeddyurappa praised Congress President Sonia Gandhi, while at the same time cursing the bjp's central leadership

 Here the Supreme Court ordered an inquiry, on the other hand, the accused were discharged from the lower court
 jaahir he ki ham nyaaypalika ko virodhabhasi halaat main nahin dekhnaa chaahate

 The countdown to the deaths of the four criminals in the Nirbhaya incident has begun
 har deshvasi ko intajar he, us khabar kaa, jab chaaron darindon kii maut kii khabar tihaad jail se baahar aegi
 The four convicts Mukesh, Vinay and Akshay have been lodged in Tihar for the last seven years
 chauthe doshi pawan ko bhi mondoli jail se tihaad jail shift kiya gaya he
 Now preparations are on for hanging
 aapako bataa den ki jab kisi ko faansee di jaati he, to jail main vakt tham sa jaataa he
 The process of hanging is not easy even after a decree which is not easy
 jail minial ke anusaar kai ahm baton kaa khyaal rakhaa jaataa he
 Like keeping the prisoner separate
 uske swasth kaa khyaal rakhana
 Monitoring her for 24 hours so that she does not harm herself
 lekin jail main sabase ahm hota he, faansee kii prakriya ke dauraan vakt kaa ruk janaa
 Stops in jail during hanging
 Actually, taking any culprit to the gallows is also a long process
 jiske liye kai ahm niyam kanoon hai
 Which are strictly followed
 isamen sabase ahm he ki jab kisi bhi sajaa paae doshi kaidi ko faansee di jaati he to vah karrwai tab tak anjaam tak nahin pahunchati, jab tak laash fande se neeche nahin utaar lee jaae
 During the process of execution, every work is stopped inside the entire jail
 har kaidi apane cell or apane barrack main hota he
 Even in jail there is no movement
 aasaan shabdon main maane to jaise jail main vakt tham sa jaataa he
 There is silence and silence everywhere
 darasal, ye sab jail minial kaa hissaa he
 But as soon as the doctor declares the prisoner dead
 laash fande se utaar lee jaati he
 And when the process of hanging ends, all the work in jail starts again
 jail kaa jivan phir chalane lagata he
 Death to convicts, justice to Nirbhaya Has four people ever been hanged together in their country? What happens before hanging
 faansee ghar yaa faansee kothi main kya hota he
 What happens after hanging? faansee kaa gavaah koun-koun banataa he
 There are hundreds of such questions about hanging, whose answers everyone wants to know
 or ye saare sawaal is vakt chaar logon kii vajah se uth rahe hai, jinke naam hai mukesh, pawan, akshay, vinay
 These are the four criminals of Nirbhaya whose death sentence has come on their part
 maut se bachane ke inke saare kanoonee daravaaje ab band ho chuke hai
 Only one mercy door was open, which is with the President
 lekin raham kii ummid naa ke baraabar he
 The mercy petition can be dismissed at any time from Rashtrapati Bhavan
 or jaise hi aisa hota he
 Black warrants will be issued from Patiala House Court in the names of these four
 blike warrant yani maut kaa aakhri paigaam
 What is Form 42 ie Black Warrant? These 58th people who get hanged in independent India as soon as black warrant is issued
 59wein, 60wein or 61wein gunahagaar honge
 The first execution in the country was done by Nathuram Godse, the killer of Mahatma Gandhi, while the last, the 57th, was given to Yakub Memon in 2015
 barrack se kaaphi dur he faansee kothi1945 main tihaad jail bananaa shuru hua tha
 Tihar was completed 13 years later in 1958
 or kaidi vahaan aana shuru ho gaye
 a map of the hanging house was also made on the map of Tihar in the British era
 usee nakshe ke hisaab se faansee ghar banaaya gaya
 Which is now called hanging kothi
 ye faansee kothi tihaad ke jail number teen main kaidiyon ke barrack se bahut dur bilkul alag-thalag sunsaan jagah par he
 The prisoner remains alone in the death cell, after the prisoner is signed on the warrant, the court decides the date and time of the execution by looking at the suggestions and preparation of the jail administration
 iske baad sabase pehla kaam hota he, faansee ke liye jallaad dhundhna or doosraa kaam fande kii rassi kaa intjaam karnaa
 However, the last three executions in the country, which were given to Kasab, Afzal Guru and Yakub Memon, were done without professional executioner
 teenon hi maamle main liver police vaale ne hi khinchaa tha
 Know what is hanging cell and death cell number number three in the building where there is hanging cell, there are total 16 death cells in the same building
 deth cell yani wo jagah jahaan sirf unheen kaidiyon ko rakhaa jaataa he, jinhen maut kii sazaa mili he
 The prisoner is kept alone in the death cell
 24 ghante main sirf aadhe ghante ke liye use baahar nikaala jaataa he tahalne ke liye
 The Tamil Nadu Special Police is monitored by the Tamil Nadu Special Police
 do-do ghante kii shift main inkaa kaam sirf or sirf maut kii sajaa paae kaidiyon par nazren rakhane kaa hota he
 So that he does not try to commit suicide
 isiilie deth cell ke kaidiyon ko baaki or cheez to chhodie pyjame kaa naada tak pahanane nahin diya jaataa
 Former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan said on Saturday that the Center is focusing on Kashmir, Article 370 and Pakistan, so no one is watching the economy
 unhone centre sarkaar se jidipi vruddhi dar ke chaalu vitt varsh kii pehali timahi main girakar paanch fisadi par pahunchane par paanch trillian dollar arthvyavastha banane kii yojana ke bare main sawaal kiya
 Chavan said, "it is shocking to see the growth rate fall to five per cent
" 'unhone kaha, 'agar aap pichhali paanch timahiyon par najar daalen to pichley saal is dauraan jidipi aath fisadi thi or phir yah girakar saat pratishat, 6

 chandrashekhar raav telugana kii satta par dobaaraa kabiz hone ke liye ek saavdhaneepurvak taiyaar aakraamak ranneeti ke saath bad rahe hai
 On 21 October, he organized a workshop for party leaders
 dashahara ke tyohaar se utsahit netaaon ko kesiar ne yaad dilaayaa ki buraai par achchhai kii jeet ek satat ladaai he
 KCR says, "the challenge before us now is how to take the victory figure to 100 seats
 '' kesiar kii yah baat ishaara he ki ve 7 disambar ko hone vaale chunaavon main jeet ke prati aashwast hai
 Now their fight is only to convert this victory into a grand victory
 kesiar dobaaraa jeet ko lekar itane aashwast kyon hai? shaayad unhen lagata he ki rajya ke log ab bhi yah nahin bhuule hai ki ve kesiar hi hai jinaki vajah se 2 june, 2014 ko alag telugana mila or yahi chhavi is baar bhi unki jeet pakki karegi
 But it is not as if the TRS chief is looking forward to winning the election on the same emotional issue
 unhone kaarykaal puraa hone ke nau maheene pehle hi vidhansabha ko bhang kar diya
 He was also very fast in deciding the names of candidates for the elections and on September 7, he announced the names of the candidates for 105 seats out of 119 seats
 haalanki, 90 din lanbaa chunaav abhiyaan chalaanaa koi aasaan kaam nahin he
 It is only now that many of the TRS candidates, including many of kcr's cabinet colleagues, are facing the resentment of the people in their constituencies (the truth is that in some villages, people have The candidates are also banned from entering the village)
 kesiar virodh pradarshnon se zyada chintit nahin he, haalanki unhen pataa he ki kuch ummidavaaron ke chayan ko lekar logon main gaharaa asantosh bhi he
 He took the responsibility of resolving the internal resentment of the party to his son
 tii
 Rama Rao (KTR)
 ketiar ke kandhon par badi jimmedaari he; unhen asantushton ko to niyantran main rakhana hi hoga, saath hi yah bhi sunishchit karnaa hoga ki puri party ekajute hokar chunaav ladati najar aae
 This will also be the first experience for Yuvraj to handle the internal tussle in the party
 ketiar kehete hai, ''kesiar kii chhavi aisi he ki sab apane aap shant hokar ekajute ho jaaenge
 Our leader has done very commendable work on making proper policy for the state and being unanimous on the development of the state's infrastructure
 saath hi, kuch vishisht samudaayon or vanchit samoohon ke kalyaan ko sunishchit karne ke uddeshy se unke liye vishesh kalyaan yojanaayen shuru kii gai hai
 Apart from this, the scope of at least three or more schemes was extended and it has been ensured that the benefits of those schemes reach every family in the state
 yadi kahin logon main thodi-bahut naaraazgi hogi bhi to ve kesiar kii yojanaon ke phaayde dekhte hue naaraazgi ko nazarandaaj kar denge
 "apart from this, many more things are coming out of the box
 kesiar ne ab sabhi berozegaron ko 3,016 ru

 10,000 to Rs
 prati acre karne kaa vaada kiya he
 This promise of KCR to increase the cash grant is being seen as a cut of the promise among many of the Congress's electoral promises in which it will pay Rs 2 lakh per acre to farmers when they come to power
 tak ke rin maafee kii baat kar rahi he (haalanki congress ne abhi tak chunaav ghoshnaptr jari nahin kiya he)
 It is difficult to say whether the youth of the state will be affected by such promises

 Whether KCR will get a chance again or the public wants change, it depends to a large extent on what the options are before the public
 haalanki, kesiar ko bhi vipaksh kii bhoomika ko lekar apane vichaar or asantushton ke prati apane nazariye ko badalane kii jarurat he
 "all surveys are telling that the party will win," says Deputy Chief Minister Srihari

 Priyanka Gandhi adamant on going to Sonbhadra, argued that there was no order to stop the police

 In the first week of Woodhouse, My Man Jeevjoon, when the ceos of three big telecom companies Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular wanted the Parliament's Standing Committee on Information Technology to know the reason for the call drop (interrupt call) The conversation was similar to that given in the above dialogue
 teenon companiyon ne apni nivesh yojanaon or 100 main teen kol drop ke tri (bhartiya doorsanchaar niamak praadhikaran) dwaara tay kiye gaye paimaane par khara utarane kaa bhale hi daawa kiya ho, lekin bijepi ke netaa laalkrishna adwani or vishesh aamantrit sadsy rajeev chandrashekhar samet samoochaa panel unke tark se santusht nahin hua
 Chandrasekhar says, "I think there are five calls dropping to 100 or maybe more
" companiyon kaa daawa in aankadon ke lihaaj se bakawaas he
 "this talk of Rajiv Chandrasekhar, one of the early entrepreneurs of telecom and now a leader, is useful but there is nothing special in it, because this country is the world's largest mobile phone market after China, the fastest growing market for smartphones
" It has transformed mobile phones into a symbol of ambition, growth and growth
 mobile phone par baat karte-karte kol ke katane kaa anubhav aisa he jisaki tasdik mumbai ke marchent bankeron se lekar dilli ke vakil, chennai main baithe siio, patna ke chaatr yaa phir is desh main mobile istemaal karne vaala koi bhi vyakti kar saktaa he
 If you want to say a line about the quality of service offered by India's mobile phone service providers, the famous nineteenth century British Prime Minister Benjamin Dijraeli remembers that famous sentence, "lies, white lies and just statistics
" ”aap is bare main mumbai ke 44 varshiya marchent banker rajeev singhl (naam badla hua) se puch sakate hai
 While traveling, Singhal is nervous about picking up conference calls as the call drops in the middle of the conversation
 ve kehete hai, “yah badi sharmindagi vaali baat he ki aap apane global sahyogiyon yaa graahakon se samvaad main hote hai or bich main hi phone cat jaataa he
 It is an all-round loot that if the call is from India, it has to be cut off in the middle
 ” isi vajah se ve aisi baatcheet ke liye puraane landline ko istemaal karnaa pasand karte hai
 He says, "even after hours of conversation on the landline, you are not disturbed
 yah sehat keliye bhi mufeed he
 "delhi-based 36-year-old Pooja Chandra had to hire a receptionist at her law firm Cicero eight months ago, whose job was to send every incoming call to her south Delhi office's landline
 ve apana anubhav bataati hai, “aath maheene pehle hamaare paas landline nahin thi lekin is ilaake se kai tower hataa die gaye hai, isliye kol drop ke bagaiyr baat karnaa naammumkin ho gaya tha
 That's why i asked my customers to call the landline
 ”kaarobaar uchhla, seva khastahalbharat main 95 karod se zyada mobile phone conection hai or shulk ke maamle main bhi yah duniya ke sabase saste deshon main ek he, phir bhi sevaaon ke maamle main shaayad yah sabase badtar he jise upabhoktaaon kii shikayaton se samajha ja saktaa he
 Tri's figures give only a glimpse of the entire picture
 mobile seva pradaataaon kii sevaaon par tri kii haalia jaanch yani disambar 2014 kii timahi ke ant tak kaa pradarshan bataata he ki desh main maujuud 2ji ke 183 network main sirf 25 yani har saat main ek aise hai jo teen fisadi kol drop kii tri kii kasuti par khare nahin utarate or jinke liye sidhe seva pradaata ko dosha diya ja saktaa he
 In industry parlance, it is called "TCH (traffic channel) felony" or "TCH drop"
 iskaa sidhaa-sa matlab he ki seva pradaata ke paas sampark banaae rakhane ke liye takneekee dakshata kaa abhaav he
 This may be due to overload on the system or due to insufficient infrastructure or technical disturbances
 is audit ke nattejey haalanki pichhali timahi ke nateezon se maamuli sudhaar dikhaate hai jisamen tri kii tisiech kol drop kii dar 3 fisadi se kam hone kii kasuti par khara na utarane vaale networkon kii sankhya kul 183 2ji networkon main 27 thi
 TRAI says that mobile service providers have improved in the quarter ended December in terms of call drop and TCH congestion
 duusari ore jaanch main paaya gaya ki seva ke liye uplabdh base steshnon kii uplabdhta, acchhee gunvattta ke conection or interconection kanjeshan ke bindu ke maamle main companiyon kaa pradarshan pehle se badtar hua he
 Call drop of 3G networks has not changed in the same period
 desh main maujuud 94 3ji networkon main 15 aise paae gaye yani har chah main ek network jahaan donon timahiyon main tisiech kol drops kii dar tri ke tay kiye hue teen fisadi se zyada rahi
 Three of the nine operators in Mumbai's Mega Circle failed to maintain their call drop rate below three per cent in the December quarter, while two such operators were found in Delhi
 lagaataar badhati shikayaton ke kaaran ab sarkaar ne is maamle main dakhal diya he or seva pradaataaon ko chetavanee di he ki unhone kol drop kii badhati dar ko thaamne ke liye kuch nahin kiya to unase riyaayaten chin lee jaaengi
 In a conversation with India Today, Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad called upon the companies to go a step ahead in response to their concerns
 unhone kaha, “kol drop kii gaharaati samasya se nibatane ke liye unhen apana infrastracchar durust karnaa hoga
 The telecom companies will have to work a lot more in this matter
 ” zyada spectrum kii nilaamee kii sambhaavna par unhone kaha ki sarkaar aisa usee haalat main karegi jab uske paas or spectrum uplabdh hoga or spectrum kii kami ko infrastracchar durust na karne kaa bahaanaa nahin banaaya ja saktaa he
 Experts say that the root of the problem lies somewhere between the data trap and complex government policies
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki kol drop kii samasya ko swatantra rup se nahin dekha ja saktaa kyonki iske peeche kai kaarak kaam kar rahe hai
 These include the challenges posed by physical infrastructure, lack of spectrum and issues related to electromagnetic radiation from telecom towers, which has led people to believe that towers are not allowed to be erected around their homes
 bharat main 4,25,000 base transmitting stesan (beaties) hai jinhen lokapriy bhashaa main mobile phone tower kehete hai
 It is believed that their number is insufficient for the increasing number of mobile phone holders
 paramarshdaata form deloit main partner hemanth joshi maanate hai ki bharat main agar dhwani or data ke pareshan kii gunvattta ko sudhaarna he to atirikt do lakh toweron kii jarurat hogi
 This requires heavy investment as it will cost between Rs 15 and 20 lakh to build a tower
 kaa kharch aata he
 Says Joshi, “A similar challenge is posed to the profits of telecom companies
 ” doorsanchaar udyog philhal do lakh karod ke karj main duba he, kyonki doorsanchaar companiyon ne apane vistaar ke liye bainkon se kaaphi karj liya he
 Their investment in spectrum is so much that it will shock the mind
 march main samaapt hue spectrum aavanton ke liye doorsanchaar companiyon ne sarkaar ko ek lakh karod ru
 Has paid of
 joshi kehete hai, “companiyon ne 3ji sevaayen dene ke liye kaaphi nivesh kiya he lekin toweron main unhen abhi or nivesh karnaa baaki he
 "third generation services ie 3G provide higher rates of data transfer than second generation ie 2G but only 9% of India's total mobile subscribers are covered
 yah sankhya bhi maamuli nahin he
 The number of mobile Internet users in India is 25 crore, which puts it in the second place after the US and today more and more people are becoming part of the smartphone market to stay connected to the world
 isse bharat main mobile sevaaon kaa istemaal karne vaale logon kii sankhya teji se badhati ja rahi he
 Raja Lahiri, partner at business and finance consulting firm Grant Thornton, says, "the spectrum is increasingly under pressure due to the ever-increasing demand for voice and the increased data demand due to all applications of e-commerce, music and movie downloads
 mobile prayoktaaon kii sankhya jahaan bahut teji se badi he, vahi prati upabhokta ausat shulk ko bhi badaye jane kii jarurat he
 However, it is growing due to value-added services and data, which has created possibilities for companies to increase their earnings
 ”radiation kaa bhayakya mobile phone toweron se hone vaala vikiran manushyon ke liye nuksandeh he? duniya bhar ke jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki iske sakshya maujuud nahin hai isliye in toweron ko surakshit mana janaa chahie
 Kneeling in the face of this atmosphere of fear, India's mobile phone service providers have reduced the rate of radiation from towers to a tenth of the global scale
 iske baavjood logon main dar he jiske chalate kai houseing socitiyaan apane yahaan in toweron ko nahin lagane deteen
 The work of the International Commission for non-ionizing Radiation (ICNIRP), a Munich-based organization, is to provide scientific consultation on the side effects of radiation
 iske mutabik, ek telecom tower se ek simit sthaan main urja kaa ghanatv 4,500 millivot prati varg meter kaa hona chahie
 In India, 450 milliwatts per square meter has been allowed for its tenth part, ie GSM, while 1,000 milliwatts are allowed for 3G and 4G
 joshi kaa maananaa he ki itane kathor niyaman ke chalate hi telecom seva pradaata kam tower lagaate hai jiske chalate unki kshamta aparyaapt rahati he or kol drop kii samasya paidaa hoti he
 In terms of customers, a spokesperson for Vodafone, India's second largest telecom service provider, says, "we are having trouble finding places to erect towers in urban areas due to fear of electromagnetic radiation
" ” unka kahana he ki is samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye sarkari sansthaaon ko janata tak pahunchnaa hoga or unke bich vikiran se suraksha jaise masale par jaagrukta failaani hogi
 Airtel, India's largest telecom service provider, declined to comment on the issue, although the company's chairman Sunil Mittal said in a news interview in June that his company oneweb, to address the call drop problem, It is about to buy a minority stake in the global consortium which provides broadband through 648 satellites
 iske tahat chhaton par ek chota-sa antina lagaaya jayega jo upgrahon se judaa hoga or 300-400 meter ke daayre main ek swachaalit base stesan nirmit kar degaa jisase 3ji or 4ji mobile phone par connactivity bani rahegi
 Akhil Gupta, Vice Chairman of Bharti Enterprises and Executive Chairman of Bharti Infratel, said at the ceo's Round Table meeting at Digital India event held in Delhi on July 3, “I am confident that the call drop problem can be resolved
 asal main isse logon se zyada hamen pareshaani hoti he
 He also said that the industry is also facing these propaganda that there is "radiation from the tower or we want to use government assets to install the tower"
 kol drop kii samasya kaa pratyaksh pramaan agar base transmitting stesan hai to adrishy pramaan spectrum naam kii cheez he
 Spectrum is the electromagnetic bandwith or radio waves that transmit mobile phone waves
 iske aavanton par sarkaar kaa niyantran he or 2ji ghotaale or endie sarkaar dwaara kii gai nilaamee hi is baat kaa sanket he ki yah kitna mahangaa kudarti sansaadhan he
 Sandeep Karanwal, director of the telecommunications organization GSMA, says that compared to other countries like South Africa, Australia or Malaysia, the amount of spectrum available with Indian operators is very less
 mumbai or dilli jaise shaharon main kuch ilaakon main tower ek-duusare ke behad kareeb hote hai isliye or tower lagaana naammumkin ho jaataa he
 Therefore, the only option is to increase the amount of spectrum given to operators
 joshi kehete hai, “aise vakt main jab duniya 5ji jaisi nai takanic kii ore mud rahi he, bhartiya doorsanchaar udyog ab bhi aavashyak nivesh kaa jugad karne ke liye hi sangharsh kar rahaa he
 "he says that to match the pace of the world, the Indian telecom industry has to pay Rs 6 lakh crore
 se zyada kaa nivesh chahie
 The government has acted to push them back, challenging the claim of telecom operators in the case of a vaulted, narrower bandspectrum
 siio kii golmes baithak main doorsanchaar mantri ravishankar prasad ne kade shabdon main kaha ki companiyon ke paas bina kisi rukaawat ke phone sevaayen pradaan karne ke liye paryaapt spectrum maujuud hai isliye unhen apane tantra ko durust karne kii jarurat he
 Companies have not taken this warning ten days after the meeting of the Parliamentary Committee on Information Technology

 He claims that the global average is 50 mhz while India's operator 10
 5 megahertz ke spectrum se kaam chalaate hai
 It is 65 mhz in Europe, 45 mhz in Asia and 28 mhz in Africa
 masalan, shanghai main uplabdh spectrum dilli ke mukaable dhai guna he, haalanki donon hi shahar apane aakaar or aabaadi ke ghanatv ke maamle main lagbhag samaan hai
 According to a study by Bharti Airtel, Delhi's network has 23 times more load than Shanghai
 bharti airtel ke network par vyast ghanton ke dauraan ek ghante main ek saath dedh lakh kol aati hai&companiyon ke mutabik, sabase vyast ghante subah ke aath se das ke bich hote hai
 Companies complain that in the 2015 auction only 5 mhz was auctioned for 3G operators
 sarkaar ke bheetar soch yah he ki spectrum ke kai upyog hote hai isliye akele doorsanchaar companiyaan uski upabhokta nahin ho saktin or isiilie iskaa bantwaaraa raksha, railway, antariksh vibhaag or saarvajanik upakramon samet anya ke bich kiya jaataa he
 Chandrasekhar explains, “the government's strategy is to create competition and make money from spectrum through auctions
 sarkaar chaahati he ki har koi spectrum kaa samuchit upyog kare
 It is not infinite
 aapako behatar sevaaon ke liye navachaar karnaa hoga or unhen pradaan karana hoga&saarvajanik niti kaa vaid uddeshy yahi he
 "tenancy ratio is doing the work to make matters worse
 yah operataron kii sankhya he jinhone prati tower apane antina laga rakhe hai
 This number 1 of 2014-15
 77 se badhkar 2020 tak 2
 48, as reported by Deloitte
 isaki mukhya vajah data kaa badhata istemaal he
 It is believed that the number of 2G, 3G and 4G tenants will increase to 12,68,000 by 2020, although the rate of increase of towers will be slower than this
 report kahati he ki 2020 tak kul toweron kii sankhya 5,11,000 rahegi
 Rajat Banerjee, senior director, Deloitte India, says, "india is at the cusp of the data revolution, so this is the right time to look forward to the future of the tower industry here
" desh main logon ke bich smartphone ke badhate upyog ke kaaran data gunatmak gati se vruddhi karegaa jiske liye atirikt data sthalon kii paryaapt sankhya kii jarurat hogi
 a study by Deloitte says that operators are now expanding their network coverage by expanding 4G networks and also increasing their 3G presence
 badhate data upyog se sanchalit kawarej ke kaaran mana ja rahaa he ki akele data sevaaon ke liye khadey kiye jane vaale swatantra toweron main saal dar saal chakravriddhi dar 2020 tak 125 fisadi kii rahegi jabaki anya tower agle paanch saal tak 1
 Will grow at the rate of 89 percent
 philhal sirf 3ji or 4ji ke liye swatantra toweron kii sankhya kareeb 700 he
 The decline in the growth of voice usage is also raising fears that the business of independent towers may not be affected
 haalanki data sevaaon main vruddhi hi bhavishya main toweron kii vruddhi main yogadan degi or aantarik samaadhaanon tathaa chote cell sthalon kaa maarg prashast karegi
 With increasing competition in the market, now the emphasis of companies is not on increasing their customers but on improving the base of active consumers
 niyaman or javabdehiek samaadhaan yah he ki toweron ko badhaayaa jaae
 For this, companies will have to loosen their pockets
 ab 4ji network ke aane ke baad maujuuda kshamta aparyaapt ho jaaegi or us par bhaar bad jayega, isliye zyada tower ek anivaaryta ho jaaenge
 Some people say that India should experiment with towers which consume less energy, but after persuading them by running awareness programs among the public, these towers should be installed in a more dense way
 isse vikiran ke bhay or kol drop donon samasyaon kaa samaadhaan hoga
 TRAI will also have to be vigilant in the case of companies that survive with heavy call drop rates in some circles as the national average is even below this
 iskaa ek tarika yah he ki cirkilon ke bheetar kol kii gunvattta kii javabdehi seva pradaataaon par tay kar di jaae
 TRAI was created to keep an eye on the telecom industry, but its critics say that the organization has lost its edge
 kharaab seva gunvattta ke liye dand or jurmaane se sambandhit niyamon ke masaude ab bhi adhisuchana kii pratiksha kar rahe hai
 Last July 7, the government directed the Department of Telecommunications to conduct a special audit of mobile networks and asked TRAI to develop a system of incentives and punishment for service quality
 yah audit doorsanchaar vibhaag kaa pravartan, sansaadhan or nigaraanee prakoshth karegaa
 The first phase of investigation will audit all the metros and state capitals
 iske puraa hone kii koi samay seemaa tay nahin he
 Industry experts like Ashish Sharma of Pricewater housecoopers believe that the root of the problem is that the telecom sector is not financially viable
 ve kehete hai, “sarkaar chaahati he ki kam shulk par seva dene vaale pradaataaon kii sankhya zyada ho or kawarej bhi zyada ho
 The average fee for every consumer in India is three dollars while in the US it is $ 57, which means the industry is faltering due to capital expenditure
 companiyaan ab jo nivesh karne kaa soch rahi hai, vah unhen paanch saal pehle karnaa chahie tha
 "even though big players in the telecom sector like Airtel and Vodafone claim that they are investing thousands of crores and their capital expenditure has been consistently high, pwc's analysis shows that telecom companies in India are about 15 per cent of their earnings
 Investment in infrastructure while in China the figure is 30%

 100 varg kimi main faile kshetra main based ek lakh se adhik log is aapadaa se prabhavit hai
 Hundreds of families have been rendered homeless and the death toll has risen to 35
 uttarkashi nagar ke joshiyaada, tiloth or sameepvarti gangori kshetra main kul milakar kareeb 250 dukaane, awasaiya bhawan or darjanabhar se adhik hotel jameendoj ho gaye hanjoshiyaada main bhagirathi ne itnaa raudra rup dikhaaya ki darjanon makaanon or hotalon ko giraane ke baad ab vahaan bache makaan bhi dhire-dhire nadi main samaa rahe hai
 Half a dozen shops, parks, temples, dozens of houses along the banks of the Bhagirathi, footpaths to walk on the banks of the bridge, a walkway, everything collapsed in Bhagirathi, with a large part of the motor bridge connecting the two bridges of Uttarkashi in Tiloth broken
 Huh
 saamaajik kaaryakarta pratap pokharial kehete hai, ''logon ne nadi tat tak kabja kar galati kii he
 “the damage caused by the disaster has also been due to encroachment on the Bhagirathi coast
 1975 se 1985 ke bich uttarkashi main patte par jameen dene kaa bada khel hua
 During this period, whoever had access to the district administration, the municipality and the district panchayat, acquired a lease of 2 to 20 fists on the river bank
 yah khel 1978 kii baadh ke un nishaanon ke bich khelaa gaya, jo bhagirathi ne bhavishya main bhi baadh kii ashanka ke liye khinchi thi
 The district administration, bypassing the flood line of Bhagirathi, also allotted leases to the lower area on the Bhagirathi coast in Tiloth
 yahaan tak ki pul se nichle kshetra main bhi patte baante gaye
 The mistake of distributing the lease in the flood zone of Tiloth had already been done by the district administration, people made a bigger mistake than that
 logon ne aavantit patton se aage badhkar nadi tat ko hi paat daalaa or nadi kii dhara tak nirmaan karaayaa
 Encroachment took place at Bhagirathi for 20-30 meters in the Ganga Vihar Colony on lease land near Tiloth bridge
 ab baadh main makaanon ke bah jane ke baad dashakon pehle sarkaar dwaara lagaae gaye tatbandh ubhar aae hai, jo ab tak colony ke makaanon ke neeche dabe hue the
 Many influential people also got leases in this colony, including former block chief and district panchayat member Suresh Chauhan and alumni association president and Swamjal Project Manager Jagmohan Singh Chauhan
 suresh chouhan ne aavantit patte main makaan banaaya, jabaki nadi tat par atikaraman kar khet or parking bhi banaai
 Now their parking has been absorbed in Bhagirathi including trains
 ghar ke neeche kaa bhaag bah jane ke baad chouhan ke parivaar ko peeche kii taraf se diwaar todakar nikalnaa padaa
 The municipality, which is responsible for controlling the encroachment, also proved to be encroached
 tiloth pul ke paas palika ne nadi par aadha darjan se adhik dukaanon kaa nirmaan karaayaa, jo ab bhagirathi main samaa gaye hai
 Apart from Ganga Vihar, Gharat Mohalla and Valmiki Basti have also been allotted on the right bank of the river
 nagar main sabase adhik nuksaan joshiyaada kshetra main hua he kyonki yahaan nadi tat par bane sabhi bhawan sidhe bhagirathi kii suraksha diwaar ke upar bane hai
 The question is, how can buildings and hotels be built directly on the river's security wall? It is a game of trespassing
 galat tareeke se patte vitaran ke saath hi bhagirathi tat par atikaraman kaa doosraa kaaran yah he ki aaj bhi uttarkashi nagar kaa aadha hissaa hi nagarpalika kshetra main he
 The large area on the other side of Bhagirathi, including Josiyada, is not in the municipal area
 is kaaran yahaan atikaraman ko chikkit tak nahin kiya jaataa
 Pradeep Bhatt, the alumni association of Uttarkashi, says that in areas where colonies were settled by occupying river banks, there was more damage
 nagar se lage gangori kasbe main jahaan asee ganga or bhagirathi kaa sangam he, vahaan bhi bhayanak tabaahi hui he
 More than half a dozen shops and cooperative banks built along the road in Gangotri Road have not survived
 aapadaa ke haftabhar biit jane ke baad bhale hi mukhyamantri ne do baar uttarkashi kaa daura kar liya ho, lekin aapadaa peedit janata mukhyamantri ke ravaie or aapadaa raahat kii sthitiyon se khaasi naaraaz he
 The Chief Minister, who flew by helicopter for the first time, did not even bother to land in Uttarkashi, while the second time he arrived on August 8, but he did not talk to the victims anywhere

 The mighty Arjuna started worshiping Lord Shiva by establishing Shiva Linga in the legship as per Krishna's advice
 kathor aradhana ke baad bhagwaan shiv prasann hue or unhone arjuna ko parakhane ke liye kiraat vesh main mata parvati ke saath kailash parvat se prasthaan kar lechubir jangal hote hue guzar rahe the
 Just then, a wild Barah was coming to attack Arjun
 usee vakt arjuna ne us junglee barah par apana tir se nishaanaa saadhaa
 At the same time Lord Shiva also injured that wild Barah
 jaise hi arjuna ne us shikaar par apana daawa kiya
 At the same time Lord Shiva disguised as Kirat also asserted his authority over that victim
 itane main hi donon main yuddh shuru ho gaya
 As soon as Arjuna disguised himself as Kirat, shot the arrow at Lord Shiva, the arrow returned
 ise dekhakar arjuna pareshaan ho gaye or bhagwaan shiv kaa dhyaan karne lage
 During this, Lord Shiva gave his visions and said that i am happy, tell me what boon you want
 arjuna ne mahabharat yuddh main vijay praapt karne hetu vardaan maanga
 Pleased with Lord Shiva, gave Arjuna the Parashurama weapon

 orgeniser ke is ravaiye se naaraaz hokar malaika ne sho par jane se manaa kar diya
 According to reports, all the vitickets of this show were also sold out
 vahiin orgeniser se is bare main sawaal kiya gaya to unka kahana tha, technical ishyu kii vajah se sho cancil hua he
 We did not have any argument from the actress
 ho saktaa he pradhanmantri narendra modi ko unke raajnneetik bayaan aamtaur par ulte na padate hon lekin ek pasa ulta pad hi gaya
 He said that Mayawati has been betrayed by Congress and Akhilesh Yadav, who had aligned with them, but Mayawati completely rejected her statement a day later
 itnaa hi nahin mayawati ne apane samarthakon se apil kar daali ki wo raibareli or amethi main congress ke sheersh netaa sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ke paksh main vot daalen
 Mayawati said that after four rounds of voting in Uttar Pradesh, the backward PM Modi is trying to sow thorns among his Akhilesh Yadav in a very clichéd manner
 lekin vah isaki koi parvaah nahin kar rahi hai
 But PM Modi's assertion that Mayawati is unaware of the conspiracy of Congress and Yadav, this provoked Mayawati and as a result, peace was seen between Congress and Mayawati
 jabaki isse pehle guna main bispi ke pratyaashee ke congress main shaamil hone ke baad mayawati ne madhya pradesh main kamalnath sarkaar se samarthan waapas lene kii dhamkee di thi, akhilesh yadav ne bhi unka samarthan karne kaa elaan kar diya tha
 So has the Congress carved a place in Mayawati's heart? However, Mayawati does not give interviews, so i spoke to the leaders of Congress, SP and BSP to find out what the position of Mayawati might be in this game of power
 maine yah paaya
 First of all, Mayawati was very angry that Modi has made her an image poor and cheated by other leaders
 jabaki bahan ji kii chhavi aisi he ki vah bahujan samaaj or votaron ke bich aisi majboot netaa he ki jo dalit adhikaron kii raksha kar sakati hai
 His strong image cannot be compromised, which always determines the bsp's destiny as well
 modi ne unako shaktiheen or aisi mahila ke taur par sthapit karne kii koshish kii jo pechida raajnneeti ko samajhane main naakaam he, galati kar di
 It was an insult to Mayawati, who was the four-time chief minister of Uttar Pradesh
 mayawati ne bijepi ko haarane waalon kii jamaat kahkar sood samet jawaab diya
 On the other hand, voting is going on in 14 seats of eastern Uttar Pradesh today
 mayawati ne saarvajanik rup se kaha he ki bijepi ke khilaaf padane vaala vot ek saath aa jaae jo ki ek prakaar se modi ke lae saarvajanik jhidki thi
 Thirdly, Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav have full idea that the BJP is in a shambles after the formation of the grand alliance and is busy in persuading the voters
 sapa ke ek netaa ne kaha, 'hamen pataa he ki ve kya karne main samarth hai, ve bahan ji ko mahagathbandhan kii kamjor link ke rup main bataane main jute hai jo mahatvakankshaon or dabaav main aa jaaengi'
 The SP leader further said, 'you would be surprised to know that Mayawati had suggested a joint rally with Dimple Yadav in Kannauj
 isse akhilesh or dimple bahut khush hue or dimple ne jab unke pair chhue to unhone unako apni bahu kii tarah se aashirwad diya
 Please understand the message given to our voters and cadres
 dalit or yadavon ke bich saalon se rahi khatas ke baad saaf taur par ab narmi aa rahi he'
 Earlier Mayawati also shared the stage in Mainpuri with Akhilesh's father and his enemy Mulayam Singh Yadav
 do dashakon ke baad donon ke saath ai tasviren kaaphi viral hui thim
 The cadre of both parties had observed this enthusiastically
 chauthaa, mayawati or akhilesh yadav ke bich jis tarah se camestry dikhaai de rahi he, isse donon hi partiyon ke netaa hairaan hai or congress ke liye bhi ruchi badhaane vaala he
 To make Mayawati always feel like a respected senior partner, Akhilesh Yadav himself went ahead and took up such things as attacking Congress, with whom Mayawati never had a good relationship
 duusari ore aisa lagata he ki mayawati, akhilesh yadav ko raajnneetik lene-dene pare pasand karti hai, jiske liye vah jaani jaati hai
 He told Mulayam Singh Yadav that he has raised his son properly
 unhone akhilesh yadav ko 'tiger bom' jo saare dard thik kar detaa he
 Such pleasantries between these two big satraps of Uttar Pradesh are troubling BJP
 iskaa andaja bijepi netaaon ke bayanon se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 CM Yogi mocked the grand alliance by calling it 'bua and Babua' and said that the nephew was being fooled
 to duusari ore piem modi kehete hai ki bhatija buaa ko bevakoof bana rahaa he
 While handling the situation after the threat of Mayawati's withdrawal of support, CM Kamal Nath said that all issues will be resolved
 bhartiya raajnneeti main shishtataa ke saath samvaad main maahir congress netaa ne mayawati or akhilesh yadav ke saath lambii baithak kii
 After apologizing, there was talk of communication gap and BJP as the main villain as well as fulfilling all the demands in future
 kamalnath pehle congress main mayawati ke mukhya sandeshvahak maane jate the
 But this time he also took help from another Congress leader
 iske alaava akhilesh yadav ne bhi mayawati se kaha ki unhen pehle jeetna hoga uske baad congress ke saath sameekaran ke thik kiye jaaenge
 Finally, the Congress has now stopped discussing the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, which annoys both the SP and the BSP
 rahul gandhi or priyanka gandhi sahit congress saarvajanik rup se kah chuki he ki vah sabhi siton main pratyaashee utaarne kaa makasad bijepi ke vot baant mahagathbandhan kii madad karnaa he
 a senior BSP leader says, his public statement has been given very wrong words, it happens when you speak without any preparation
 hamaare netaaon ne chizon ko adhyayan karne kaa faisla kiya taaki iskaa galat matlab na nikal sake
 There is a good lesson for Congress
 khayr, akhilesh yadav ne bhi maraham lagaaya he
 He said that the next PM will be a woman who will be from the grand alliance
 yah apane sahyogi kaa khulaa samarthan he jiskaa sapana he desh ke sabase oonche pad ko sanbhale
 At present, the opposition has put Mayawati in its court
 lekin yah aisa kuch he jis par hameshaa bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa he

 But Ahmed Patel himself has called these posters false and said that he is not a contender for the post of Chief Minister
 ahamed patel ne twit ke jariye di safyeeposters chaspa hone ke bazhamad patelne twit kiya ki is prakaar ke galat poster lagaakar afvaah failaana bijepi ke haar ke dar ko darshata he
 Do they really depend on such dirty methods? i was never in the race to become Chief Minister and neither will i be
 Putting up fake posters and orchestrating a rumour campaign shows the utter desperation of the BJP
 Fearing defeat, do they have to rely on such dirty tricks? i have never been a candidate for CM and will never, ever be— Ahmed Patel (@ahmedpatel) December 7, 2017 Ahmed Patel wrote that the issue is that the BJP is focused on the work done in the last 22 years of governance
 Wants to wander isliye jhuthe hatkando ko apana rahi he
 But the people of Gujarat have made up their minds this time
 The moot issue is that BJP is trying very very hard to divert the narrative from its performance of last 22 years to a divisive agenda

 haalanki, voton kii ginati 10 ghante baad hui
 The result came late at 2 pm, Congress candidate Ahmed Patel ensured victory
 jeet ke baad ahamed patel ne twit kar likhaa tha ki satyamev jayate
 Ahmed Patel tweeted that it is not just my victory
 yah satta, paise or state mashinari ke durupyog kii sabase jabardast haar he
 i want to thank every MLA who voted for me despite the threat and pressure from BJP

 It is also possible that the website has the content you need, but it does not appear in Google's search results
 isaki vajah he google ke search ingine main bada badlaav
 Starting next Tuesday, Google is going to change the search behavior of its search engine
 google par search karne ke 13 tarikene formula search main unheen website ko tavajjo degaa jise google 'mobile friendli' maanata he
 Any website that does not fit the new scale set by Google will find a place on the search page at the bottom
 vahiin paimaane par khara utarane vaali website top ranking paaegi
 Google will search your 'missing' Android phone
 Let us tell you that Google's new formula will not apply to desktops and laptops
 in dinon zyaadaatar log search karne ke liye apane smartphone kaa istemaal karte hai, aise main ye badlaav yujar bihaviour ko bade str par prabhavit karenge
 Many search experts are calling this change the name of Mobile-geddon
 google baloon se degi internet sevagugle dwaara kiye gaye badlaav ke bare main ahm jaankaree1

 3
 website par kisi ection ke liye banaae gaye batan aise hon jo chote screen vaale mobile par bhi aasaani se dikhe or clic kiye ja saken

 aisi websiton kii graphics ko mobile par lod hone main zyada vakt lagata he
 Apart from this, the text of these websites also does not fit perfectly on the small screen
 aisa nahin he ki google ne ye badlaav achaanak hi kiye hai
 Google has been asking companies associated with digital platforms for many years to build their site keeping in mind the mobile user as most people search on mobile
 tabhi to nae search formule kii jaankaree 2 maheene pehle hi de di gai thi
 Google had issued guidelines and also released testing tool to make every website conform to the new formula
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki is badlaav ke baad ek baar phir digital world main ho hallaa machana tay he
 Earlier, there were also controversies when Google made major changes in search engines in 2011 and 2012
 us vakt google kaa kahana tha ki uskaa makasad galat websiton ko search rigelt se baahar nikalnaa tha
 But many websites alleged that this change of Google caused them great harm as their content got poor ranking on the search page
 jis vajah se unke content ko nahin padhaa gaya
