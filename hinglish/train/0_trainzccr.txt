 But this time Nitish Kumar did not reject the help of five crore rupees from Gujarat, but accepted it with pleasure
 fark sirf itnaa aayaa he ki 2010 main narendra modi gujarat ke mukhyamantri the or aaj vijay roopani

 Bhupendra Singh said that the situation has changed a lot in 7 years and time is strong

 Renowned as Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi loved many things in life but did not like cinema at all

 He first saw the film Mission to Moscow in the year 1943
 industrileaist shanti kumaar morarji ke mutabik, gandhi kii associat miraben ne gandhi ko ye film dekhne ke liye manaaya tha
 Gandhi was living in the compound of Narottam Morarji's family bungalow after he was released from the Aga Khan jail
 ek din us compound main pols lagane kaa kaam chal rahaa tha or bijli conection lagane kaa intjaam kiya ja rahaa tha
 After getting permission from the local municipality, this work was being done so that Gandhi could be shown the film
 ye sho 21 may 1944 ko rakhaa gaya tha
 Although the film was based on the biography of US Ambassador Joseph Davis of Russia, Gandhi was agitated after seeing women in lesser clothes in this film
 shanti kumaar likhte hai ki unhone vahaan maujuud logon ko neude seens dikhaane ke chalate danta bhi tha
 Gandhi saw this Hindi film after English, after this show, Art Director Kannu Desai made up his mind to show Gandhi a Hindi film
 is film kaa naam tha ram rajya
 Desai was the art director of this film
 is film ko vijay bhatta ne produs kiya tha

 unke anusaar, gandhi ne kaha tha ki mujhe ek hindi film dekhni hi hogi kyonki maine ek english film dekhne kii galati kar di he
 The show of this film was put on 2 June 1944 for Gandhi
 mana jaataa he ki is film ko gandhi ne pehle sirf aadhe ghante ke liye hi dekhne kaa plan kiya tha lekin jab unhone is film ko dekhnaa shuru kiya to unhone ise puraa dekh liya tha
 However, in this case, Shanti Kumar says that Gandhi did not like this film at all because he did not like the noise and the screaming in the film
 filmon ko lekar negative tha gandhi kaa najariyounhone ek prere meeting ke dauraan is baat ko maanane se inkaar kar diya tha ki filmein moral teaching ke liye bhi istemaal ho sakati hai
 Gandhi was not at all satisfied with the idea that a movie could be seen sitting in a closed space without ventilation
 akhabaaron main ve hero-heroin kii tasveeron kii aalochana karte the
 Gandhi believed that instead of film theaters, he would like to open a spinning theater

 Does economic recession threaten democratic freedoms? Do economic governments suffer from the problems of increasing power? Why is it necessary for freedom of expression in democracy to be saved from shrinking the free market? These freedoms in democracy There are more pointed questions
 beete bisek baras main lokshahi kaa nayaa arthshaastra bana he jisaki madad se mukt bazaar ne aarthik swadhinata ko sanvaar kar, sarkaron ko maai baap hone se roak diya he
 With the open economy, the dependence of the people on the governments has been decreasing, so the leaders are now looking for opportunities to limit the freedom
 kya aarthik mandi loktantr kii dushman he?freedom house (loktantron kii pramanikta ko aankane vaali sabase pratishthit sanstha) kii report "freedom in da world lokshahi kaa khyath suchakank he
 According to the 2018 report, democracy faces the deepest crisis of the past several decades
 2107 main 75 loktantron (deshon) main rajnatik adhikaar, press kii aazaadee, alpsankhyakon ke haq or kanoon kaa raaj kamjor hue
 This is the 12th year of continuous decline in the freedoms of democracy
 "freedom in da world'' bataati he ki 12 saal main 112 deshon main loktantr durbal hua
 The number of dictatorial countries increased from 43 to 48
 loktantron ke bure dinon ne 2008 ke baad se jor pakadaa
 In the same year, there was a recession in the world which continues till now
 1990 ke baad puri duniya main loktantron kii surat or sirat behatar hui thi
 Not surprisingly, at the same time, economic liberalization started in many countries of the world and global development got wings
 yani ki tej aarthik vikaas kii chaaya main swadhinataayen khub fali-phulin
 Who benefits from the economic crisis? The relationship between economic liberalization and democracy is interesting
 jahaan bhi bazaar mukt hua or udhyamita ko aazaadee mili, vahaan sarkaron ko apni takat ganvaani padi, isliye mandi jaise hi bazaar ko sikodti he or nijee udhyamita ko simit karti he, sarkaron ko takat badhaane ke maukey mil jate hai
 The latest experiences show that in countries that are badly engulfed by the recession, the power of democracy has decreased
 sarkarein mandi kii madad se do tarah se takat badhaati hameekah mandi ke dauraan sarkaar apane khajaane se mukt bazaar main dakhal detii he or sabase badi niveshak ban jaati he
 In India, before 1991, the government was the architect of the economy
 doh aarthik chunautiyon ke chalate bazaar main rojgaron main kami hoti he or sarkarein logon kii jindagi-jeevika main gaharaa dakhal dene lagati hai
 So does every leader want a recession that can make him stronger and stronger? a helpless market is an expressionless! An old friend of the world of advertising used to narrate that between 2001 and 2005, newspapers and TV had space for cheap government advertisements
 Did not happen
 bazaar se mil rahe vigyaapan sarkaron ke liye jagah hi nahin chhodte the
 In the event of recession, the government becomes the biggest advertiser and campaigner and the freedom has to shrink
 "freedom in da world'' ne 2013 main bataaya tha ki global mandi ke baad europea deshon main press kii swadhinata kamjor padi
 Especially in the European community, whose record in the matter of freedom of press is unmatched, Congress official historian Pranab Mukherjee has written that in the backdrop of 1975 Emergency, inflation, unemployment, strikes and protests arising out of 1973 oil crisis There were agitations all over the country, which spoiled the political atmosphere
 yani ki imargency ke peeche mandi or mahangaai thi!vaise, ab agar aazaadiyaan puri tarah sarkaar kii paband nahin hai to sarkarein bhi aazaadiyon kaa utana besharm apharan nahin karatin jaisaa ki 1975 ke bhartiya apatkaal main hua
 Liberals need free markets and rapid economic progress because clever governments have developed subtle ways to hijack freedom within democracy
 yakeenan mukt bazaar niraapad nahin he lekin use sanbhalane ke liye hamaare paas sarkaar he
 Who will handle the autocracy of governments? For this, it is necessary to keep them small
 *** There should be differences in politics because a solution comes out of it but there should be no discrimination
 ye baaten kahin agenda ajtak main pahunche jyotiraditya sindhiya ne
 He said that he has always respected Atal ji because he was a good person
 jyotiraditya sindhiya ne aage kaha ki modi or bajpeyi kii tulana karnaa thik nahin he
 There is no equivalence in both

 The kind of politics that has taken place today requires a good person and not a diplomat

 We also oppose each other but there should be no discrimination

 Why doesn't such a picture appear in Delhi? modi or sonia ekasaath kyon nahin baithte, rahul or modi main is tarah kii baat kyon nahin hoti
 On this question, Scindia said that we have differences but do not have any discrimination
 rahul gandhi agar manabhed rakhte to sansad main modi kaa haath nahin pakadte
 Scindia said that we accept that our victory is not very big, we have got 114 seats
 bijepi ko empi main 109 siten mili hai
 BJP has got 1 percent more votes from Congress
 yah loktantr he or vah sapa or basapa ke saath hi bijepi vidhayakon ko bhi badhai dete hai
 He said that now elections have been held
 hamaare kisi se manabhed nahin he
 The state has to be taken forward by taking everyone along

 pradhanmantri narendra modi varanasi se saansad hai
 About Varanasi, he said that Mother Ganga has called him there
 ganga kii safai modi sarkaar ke agenda main sabase upar he
 If a government was formed, a separate ministry was also formed for Ganga, but what changed after 100 days? Modi talks of developing Varanasi on the lines of Japan, but is a son in the right direction in service to his mother? The same issues were discussed in Panchayat Aaj Tak's fourth session 'clean Ganga, Clean City'
 charchaa main shaamil the bijepi saansad manoj tiwari, water activist rajendra singh or congress netaa subodh kaant sahay
 Question: Modi mentioned cleanliness from the Red Fort
 ganga ko lekar sarkaar kya kar rahi he?manoj tiwari:laal kile kii pracheer se jab swatchta, shauchalay or ganga kii baat hui to mujhe laga ki nae bharat kaa nirmaan ho rahaa he
 Rajendra Singh (water Activist): It was very nice when there was talk of cleanliness from the Red Fort
 safai ke liye bahut majboot kanoon bhi he
 If the law was properly followed in the last 100 days, it would have been good for the rivers
 bharat ke pradhanmantri ne jis tarah se swatchta kii baat kii sunakar acha laga
 But if something happens in 100 days, it would have been good to have seen something
 agar modi sarkaar ganga ko lekar vaaki chintit he to maujuuda kanoonon ko sahi se lagu kar den
 Modi is saying that Ganga is mother
 magar 100 dinon main us maa ke liye baton ke alaava kuch nahin kiya
 Manoj Tiwari: Some things should be seen openly

 Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's politics in West Bengal is taking a new turn
 bengal main bijepi is tarah se aakraamak rahi he ki usne mamata banerjee kii raajnneetik takat ko paanch saal ke andar na sirf aadha kar diya balki unke baraabar main is tarah se khud ko laakar khadaa kar diya, jahaan se wo 2021 main mamata banerjee ko dharashayi karne ke bare main bhi soch rahi he
 However, despite a big defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, Mamata Banerjee is confident of her same politics
 jis par vah pichley paanch saal se chal rahi hai
 It is different that in this politics BJP got a big opportunity in Bengal
 phir bhi mamata banerjee 23 may ke nateezon ke baar lagaataar ye kah rahi hai ki wo apni yahi politics jari rakhengi
 Mamta Banerjee also said that the community whose votes they get will go to them a hundred times no matter how much anyone accuses them of appeasement
 buudhvaar ko phir mamata banerjee ne ye kehete hue bijepi ko chalange kiya ki jo unase takaraayaa chur chur ho jayega
 This aggressive politics of Mamta Banerjee continues then
 jab bijepi unke jaale par namak chhidakane main juty he
 After the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the campaign of Jai Shri Ram's slogan against Mamata Banerjee started again
 lekin mamata banerjee ne pehle hi kah diya he ki wo bijepi ke saamne sarender nahin karengi
 After all, what is it that Mamata Banerjee's politics gave the BJP a chance in Bengal, and she got the edge of Hindutva politics in Bengal
 uske baavjood mamata banerjee apni rajnatik line se hatane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 This can be understood from the equation of Muslim votes in Bengal
 india today-exis maai india ke post pole sarveypure desh kii kul aabaadi main muslim aabaadi 14% hai, lekin bengal kii kul aabaadi main ye aankada 28% yani doguna he
 According to the India today-axis My India post poll survey, 63% of Muslim voters in West Bengal went to the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in this election
 congress ko 14 percent or left ko 9 percent muslim vot mili
 At the same time, it was revealed in the analysis of the 2014 election that the Muslim community of TMC got 40%, Left 30% and Congress 20%
 yani muslim voton ko mamata banerjee ne apane paksh main puri tarah se ekajute kiya, jo congress or left se hatakar unke paale main aae-jiskaa phayda unhen 2016 ke chunaav main bhi mila, or 2019 main bhi wo 22 siten jeet pain
 There are about 9 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal where Muslim population is more than 30 percent
 pashchim bengal kii vidhansabha main kareeb 125 siten aisi hai, jahaan par muslim voter nirnaayak hai
 Interestingly, in the election of 2016, Mamta Banerjee had won bumper 90 seats in these 125 seats
 yani mamata banerjee kii ranneeti yahi lagati he ki wo puri tarah se muslim voton ko ekajute kar lengi, or apane kattar samarthakon ko banaae rakhengi
 So it can surpass his politics in the 2021 election
 mamata banerjee kaa kahana he ki agar aap log sab saath main hai to ham log bhi har ladaai main kaise ladate hai
 We will fight nothing to fear jo bhi koi kuch kahe, kehane do, jo bhi koi kahe kehane do
 We have to see, we will show success not by saying anything but by heart
 itnaa darane kii baat nahin he
 If the issue is bad then what happens is what happens to God
 taqatvar banane kii ladaafasal main, ye bengal ke liye apane apane chunavi agenda ko 2021 se pehle taqatvar banane kii ladaai he jisamen ek taraf mamata banerjee or duusari taraf team modi he
 This is the reason that preparations started from both sides soon after the results of Lok Sabha elections
 dilachasp baat ye he ki bijepi ho yaa mamata banerjee donon ne apni rajnatik line main badlaav nahin kiya
 Both feel that they will win on this path
 pashchim bengal main muslim votbank ko ekajute karne kii ranneeti par mamata banerjee lagi hai
 He has also benefited in this election
 jab 60 fisadi se zyaada muslim vot unki party ko gaye or muslim vot congress or left kii taraf kam hi gaye
 This did not harm Mamata Banerjee as much as the BJP could
 wo 42 main se 22 siten phir bhi bachaa le gai
 But the difficulty for Mamata Banerjee is that this politics has given BJP a big opportunity in Bengal
 hindutv kii raajnneeti ko dhar millipahle aapako desh bhar kaa aankada bataa dete hai jahaan par muslim aabaadi ausat se zyaada he
 In 90 such districts, BJP has won more than half of the Lok Sabha seats this time
 ausat se zyaada muslim aabaadi vaali 79 siton main bijepi ne is baar 41 loksabhaa siten jiti hai
 BJP benefited in Bengal, of which BJP benefited the most in West Bengal, where it won 18 Lok Sabha seats
 uttar dinajpur jile kii raiganj seat main muslim aabaadi 49 fisadi ke kareeb he, wo seat bijepi ne 60 hazaar vot se jiti
 In Jalpaiguri seat with 20 percent Muslim population, BJP defeated TMC by one lakh 84 thousand votes
 50 fisadi muslim aabaadi vaale malda uttar seat par bijepi ne tiemasi ko kareeb 84 hazaar ke antar se haraaya
 The BJP defeated TMC by 54 thousand votes in the Cooch Behar seat where the Muslim population is close to 30 per cent
 isi tarah balurghat, bishnupur, hughali, bardhvaan-durgapur loksabhaa siton par jahaan muslim aabaadi ausat se zyaada he, vahaan bijepi jiti he
 Now the battle of Jai Shri Ram, Jai Maa Kali, Jai Hind, Jai Bangla is going on in Bengal politics
 isi par philhal bijepi or tiemasi ke bich ek duusare ko maat dene kaa khel chal rahaa he
 Both have two years in which the BJP has put a lot of effort to demolish Mamata Banerjee's politics in 2021 and Mamata Banerjee has stopped bjp's political move in Bengal for the assembly
 raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne somvaar ko dilli sarkaar ke sansadeey sachiv bill ko uparajyapal najeeb jang ko lautaa diya he

 The contest between the Congress and the BJP in the Karnataka assembly elections is considered to be a close contest
 vahiin jedies kingmekar kii bhoomika ke liye jaddojahad main juty he
 BJP is hoping to feed lotus in Karnataka with the help of BS Yeddyurappa
 yediurppa ke saath-saath bijepi or sangh kaa bhi majboot garh maane jane vaala ilaaka tateey karnataka (costal kshetra) he
 The BJP and RSS Hindutva laboratory in Karnataka is in this coastal belt
 tateey karnataka ilaake main pichley chunaav main yediurppa kii baghawat kaa khamiyaja bijepi ko bhugatna padaa tha
 At the same time, Congress got the benefit of this
 ab jab yediurppa phir bijepi ke liye khewanhaar bane hue hai or party hindutv kii siyaasi bisaat bichaane main juty he
 In such a situation, the contest in the coastal Karnataka region has become interesting
 tateey karnataka kshetra ke tahat mangaluru, udupi or karwaar chikmagalore jile kii kareeb 20 vidhansabha siten aati hai
 Anant Kumar Hegde, a minister in the central government and a firebrand leader of the Karnataka BJP, hails from Karwar district
 paanch baar ke saansad hegade kii pahchaan rajya main hindutv ke chehre ke taur par he
 In the 2013 assembly elections, the BJP had to fight expensively to contest Yeddyurappa's separation
 party ko baari nuksaan uthaanaa padaa tha
 Congress got 13 seats from this strong fort of BJP in the last assembly elections
 jabaki bijepi ko mahaj 3 siten mili thim
 In terms of vote share, Congress got 43 per cent votes while BJP got 34 per cent, JDS 9 and others got 13 per cent votes
 vidhansabha chunaavake ek saal ke baad hi 2014 main hue loksabhaa ke chunaav main yediurppa kii bijepi main vaapasi hui to party kaa pradarshan bahut hi behatar rahaa
 The party got around 55 percent of the vote in the coastal region, while the Congress lost 3 percent of the vote and got 40 percent of the vote
 jedies kaa puraa vot hi khiskkar bijepi ke paas chalaa gaya
 JDS is merely 0
 3 fisadi vot mili
 In view of the 2014 voting pattern in the constituency, the BJP was ahead in 17 assembly seats, while the Congress was ahead in only 3 seats

 kaarykram ke satr 'shaury par siyasat' main kendriya mantri prakaash jaavdekar or congress netaa manish tiwari ne charchaa main hissaa liya
 During this time, the two leaders put forward their parties and spoke on many issues related to Rafael Deal and National Security
 rafel deal ke mudde par congress netaa manish tiwari ne kaha ki 2 ji ghotaale par 1 lakh 76 hajaar karod kaa sankethik nuksaan kaa mudda court se sire se khaarij ho gaya he or yah mithyaa kaa mayajaal sabit hua
 Weaver is doing this, BJP was doing politics of lies and deceit before the 2014 elections, but it is not going to last long
 unhone kaha ki rafel maamle main supreme court main abhi bhi sunwaayee chal rahi he
 The Modi government rejected the 126 aircraft deal because you wanted to benefit your capitalist friend, Dhanpashu, and gave the offset deal to Dhanpushu who had no experience in building ships
 iske liye tejas jaise vimaan banane vaali swadeshi company HAL ko darkinar kiya gaya
 This clearly shows your intention on national security
 to pehle hi aa jaataa rafel
 
 
 On the question of delay in Rafale, Tiwari said that Murli Manohar Joshi had said that the expenditure on national security is at the same level as it was in 1962
 suraksha kii sthaayee samiti ke chairman bisi khanduri ne kaha ki pichley chaar varsh main ek bahut hi sanyojit tareeke se rashtriya suraksha ko kamjor kiya ja rahaa he
 Both of them are not big members of Congress but are big leaders of BJP

 But you canceled the process of purchasing 126 ships to 36

 From 1971 to 2014 we remained committed to national security
 lekin kabhi hamane uskaa raajnneetikaran nahin kiya, kyonki ham ek jimmedaar sarkaar the
 Tiwari said that for the first time in 2017, there was no surgical strike, since 1998 such action has been done continuously on the border
 rahul gandhi ke masood ajahar par die bayaan par manish tiwari ne kaha ki rashtriya suraksha ke gambhir muddon ko isse bhatkaana nahin chahie
 He lashed out at Javadekar and asked whether the government has fulfilled the promises made to the public
 kya sarkaar ne 15 lakh die, kya salanaa 2 karod naukariyaan deen, kya sarkaar ne mudra ke lone par sahi aankade die
 Because of this, if the government believes that they have fulfilled the promise then it should go among the people, but we will also put our questions among the people and the people will give their decision on this also

 Scientists say that more healthy men need more sex for longer periods
 uniwarsity of chicago ke anusandhankartaaon ke ek adhyayan main yah baat saamne ai
 The study says, "men and women with very good or excellent health can be sexually active more often than men or women with average or poor health
" ’ adhyayan main kaha gaya he ki acchhee sehat vaale nar nari kharaab sehat vaale nar nari ke mukaable sex main 1
 5 to 1 8 guna zyada ruchi dikhaa sakate hai
 Associate Professor Stacy Tesler Lindau and Research Assistant Natalia Gavrilova concluded this after studying over six thousand data between 25 and 85 years
 adhyayan main kaha gaya he, ‘adhed umr main or baad ke jivan main yonik rup se sakriy, yon jivan kii gunvattta or sex main ruchi swasthya se sakaaratmak rup se jude hai
 "the study states," Sexual activity duration is longer for men, but men lose more years of sexual activity than women due to poor health
 ’british medical jarnal par online prakashit report main yah bhi paaya gaya ki jo log zyada sex karte hai, unke zyada swasth hone kii ummid zyada hoti he
 It states, 'among sexually active people, good health is often associated with it (once or more a week) in men
 ’report main yah bhi paaya gaya ki samaan swasth yon sambandh purushon or mahilaon main ek samaan nahin he
 For example, a male with very good or excellent health at the age of 55 years increases sexually active life by an average of 5-7 years compared to a male with poor health
 yah baat mahilaon par nahin lagu hoti
 Women with very good or excellent health have an average increase of just 3–6 years in a sexually active life compared to a woman with poor health

 congress ke is faisle par nishaanaa sadhate hue jetali ne kaha ki dilli main hone vaali piem kii raily ko radd kar diya gaya he taaki isaki tulana modi kii reliyon se na ho
 This is Arun Jaitley's post i have already said that the Congress party is not able to face Narendra Modi
 congress ke aghoshit piem ummidavaar koi prabhaav nahin chhod paa rahe
 Because of this, some leaders have joined Twitter and press conferences

 The Prime Minister's scheduled rally was canceled so that it does not compare with Modi's rallies

 Many former cricketers and players may be welcoming the decision to nominate Sachin Tendulkar as a Rajya Sabha member but former cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar says he is surprised at the government's decision to accept the master blaster's proposal
 sachin ke saath khel chuke manjrekar yah vichaar rakhane vaale akele nahin hai, kai anya ne bhi manjrekar kii baat kaa samarthan kiya he or unka kahana he ki tendulkar saarvajanik muddon par apana najariya vyakt karne ke liye nahin jane jate
 When asked about the reaction to Tendulkar, Manjrekar said, 'actually i am surprised by this news
 pehle is manonayan se, kyonki bina purv jaankaree ke achaanak se aisa hua
 And Sachin's acceptance of this proposal is more surprising
 ’manjrekar ne kaha, ‘jab main dekhtaa hum ki sachin sanyas lene ke baad kya kar sakate hai to maine sochaa tha ki shaayad kuch cricket se juda hua, koching or uske baad kuch or kaam yaa saamaajik kriyalap
 But becoming a Rajya Sabha member after retirement or at this stage of career is something about which i could not guess
 ’haalanki manjrekar ne kaha ki agar tendulkar chahenge to vah sansad main kaarywahi main bhaag le sakate hai
 He said, 'now he does not play all the matches in India
 vah ranjai trophy main mumbai ke liye nahin khelte hai
 If he wants to take time, he can do it and people expect the same
 vah sansad ke har satr main har din nahin jaaenge
 He can spare enough time
 ’manjrekar ne kaha ki lekin isse main puri tarah se aashcharyachakit hum
 i know him as a special kind of person
 unhone kaha ki yah sachin ke liye alag tarah kii chunauti hogi kyonki vah swabhaav se shant hai or vah cricket se jude muddon par bhi pratikriya nahin dete hai
 Cricket commentator and analyst Harsha Bhogle believes that Tendulkar does not have the experience to become an active MP
 bhogale ne kaha, ‘kai log ab tendulkar se phayda uthaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 i don't know if that's a good idea
 agar rajyasabha main sachin ko seat dekar unhen sammaan dene kaa vichaar he to thik he lekin agar aap tendulkar ko sakriy saansad ke rup main or saamaajik muddon par dhyaan dete hue dekhnaa chaahate hai to iske liye unke paas anubhav nahin he

 Saifai, a medical college student in the Medical College of UP, has been ragged and beheaded

 Even if it is not filled, then i am asked to walk while doing it
 inhen pataa he ki ujisi kii guideline he
 The Supreme Court has strict decisions
 na bhi pataa ho to sochie medical college ke itane saare chaatr milakar ek galat kaa virodh nahin kar sake, usee tarah lakhon karodon bhartiya milakar ek galat kaa virodh nahin kar pate hai
 In these democracies, it is strengthened through all these practices to remain silent and tolerated
 majboot loktantr ke ye kamazor doctor pataa nahin is video ko dekhte hue kya sochate honge
 After watching the recording, it was felt that by shaving his head, he has also been operated according to many angles of the camera
 azaad bharat ke ye medical chaatr ghulaam hone kii baadhyataa ko kitni swaabhaaviktaa ke saath nibhaae chale ja rahe hai
 You can see the fear on their faces
 ghar parivaar se darane or chup rahane kaa sanskaar mila he jo uniwarsity main aakar silebus kaa hissaa ho gaya he
 Therefore, when the District Magistrate sent the investigation team, these students said that no ragging has taken place
 inkaa mukarana hamaare loktantr main padhi likhi janata ke hone kii quality par bhi sawaal uthaata he
 So, should it be done that the students of the medical college in Saifai Aerology College are shaving their heads and going in a tilted line
 vaais chancelar kaa jawaab or laajawab he
 That they cannot withstand even ten percent of the ragging they have faced in their time
 senior kaa itnaa respect tha ki diwaar se kud jate the or vahi senior baad main samosa khilaataa tha
 Looking at these pictures, you can expect a lot from great India
 2009 main supreme court ne kaha tha ki raging maanavadhikaar kaa ulanghan he
 There are strict laws after the intervention of the Supreme Court
 desh bhar ke kalejon main raging virdohi cameti hai or nirdesh taange gaye hai
 Because many students have died due to ragging and many have committed suicide
 lekin aaj ke jamaane main jab sarkaar or system kaa varadahast, angrezi main saport ho to aap kuch bhi bol sakate hai
 This picture of Arshad Jamal and Kamal Khan's report is showing how much waste is stored in the basement of medical colleges which is being reared in the name of Sr

 After that we leave this story at your discretion
 desh main agar kahin koi system hoga to kuch hoga varanaa chaatro ne to kah hi diya he ki unki raging nahin hui he
 In ages, such Vice Chancellors come
 aise durlabh vidwaanon kii raay se hamaare samaaj main aniatikta naitikta se bhi zyaada pratishthit haiy magar medical council of india ne saifai medical kalege ko ek patr bhej diya he or ranging ke is masale par kalege ke vyavhaar par asantosh jataayaa he
 Council has asked why not suspend all seniors
 kyon na har senior par ek ek lakh kaa jurmaana lagaaya jaae
 Council has said that if ragging of 150 medical students is done, then according to this, 150 or 1
5 crore should be recovered from Fine Senior
 jab tak aisi sakhti nahin hogi medical kalejon ke tahkhaane main raging kii krur dastaanen na to baahar aaengi or na hi khatm hongi
 Even when the District Magistrate sent the investigation team, the first year students refused
 iske baad bhi ziladhikari ne lakhanu yahi report bheji he ki raging ko chhipaane kii koshish hui he
 This is not a normal occurrence
 itani bhi choti ghatana nahin he ki kisi kinare laga di jaae
 Hopefully college seniors will revise their habits and understand what they have done

 sibiai kii vakil ne kaha ki chidambaram jaanch main sahyog nahin kar rahe hai
 It is necessary to sit face to face with other accused
 chidambaram se jo dastauez maange gaye hai wo unhone nahin die hai
 The CBI said that investigations into the case are in the pre-stage of preparation of the charge sheet as they need some more documents
 sibiai ne yah bhi kaha ki yah clasik mani landring kaa cese he
 All information will be available only through inquiry
 sibiai ke vakil ne kaha ki vah cese diary dene ke liye taiyaar hai or diary court ko saunp bhi di
 Unknown officials have misused their status and Indrani Mukherjee has agreed to give $ 5 million
 sibiai ne yah bhi kaha ki indrani mukherjee ne bayaan diya he ki fahrren investment pramotion board kii manzuri kaa ulanghan hua tha jise rafa dfa karne ke liye karti chidambaram ne das lakh dollar kii maang kii thi jise peter mukherjee or indrani mukherjee ne kabool kar liya tha
 Indrani Mukherjee has become a government witness in this case
 sibiai ne 5 din kii remand maangi
 After this, Chidambaram's counsel Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Manu Singhvi presented his favor
 kapil sibbal ne kaha ki isi cese main sah-abhiyukt karti chidambaram ko 23 march 2018 ko zamaanat mil gai thi
 Another accused chartered accountant Bhaskar Raman has been given advance bail from the same court
 anya abhiyukt indrani mukherjee or peter mukherjee bhi diphalt bel par hai
 Sibal said that the High Court's decision seems that the draft charge sheet is ready and the investigation is complete
 INX main 6 sachivon ne FIPB manzuri di, koi giraftaar nahin hua
 a case has been registered in this case after 10 years
 chidambaram kabhi poochtacha se bhaage nahin
 If you are avoiding questions, then CBI is kept in court
 aaj 12 sawaal puche gaye jinamein se chah sawaal june main hi puche ja chuke hai
 Chidambaram has also replied
 sirf ek din poochtacha hui he
 The CBI could have called again if it wanted
 aaj bhi arest hone se lekar subah 12 baje tak sibiai ne koi poochtacha nahin kii jabaki chidambaram poochtacha ke liye bolte rahe
 If money has been received, it must have gone to an account, where is that account? kisne paisa diya he
 Where has been given five million dollars
 sibiai baar baar vahi sawaal kar rahi he
 Chidambaram's wife Nalini Chidambaram and her son Karthi Chidambaram were also present in the court
 chidambaram ne kaha ki unhone koi paisa nahin liya he
 i do not have an account abroad
 bete kaa videsh main acount he jo sibiai ko pataa he or har sawaal kaa jawaab diya he
 Sibal said that the foreign secretaries give 6 secretaries together, none of them have been arrested
 yah cese dastavezon ke aadhaar kaa he
 The secretaries sent to the Finance Minister and they approved

 He could be questioned anytime after 2017

 The CBI did not even write a letter that such a document was needed
 sibiai ne aisa kyon nahin kiya
 All these were speaking on behalf of Sibal Chidambaram
 sibbl ne kaha ki saat maheene tak zamaanat par faisla reserve tha
 There is serious objection to the manner in which the accused is being treated
 cese diary main jo bhi likhaa he wo saboot nahin he
 This case has nothing to do with the evidence
 kisi or chiz se lenaa dena he
 After Sibal, Abhishek Manu Singhvi debated
 singhvi ne kaha ki sara maamla indrani mukherjee ke bayaan or cese diary par aadhaarit he
 Chidambaram was summoned four months after Indrani Mukherjee's statement was recorded
 giraftaar karne ke liye indrani mukherjee ko sarkari gavaah banaaya gaya he
 Based on the statement she gave in 2018, Indrani became a government witness in 2019
 sibiai kii sari daleel is par tiki he ki chidambaram jawaab nahin de rahe hai
 It is right to seek police remand on the basis of not cooperating
 singhvi ne kaha ki jin 6 sachivon ne manzuri di thi unamem se ek ko reserve bank kaa governor banaaya gaya
 Chidambaram merely sent the proposal to 6 secretaries of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board and Chidambaram approved
 un par sabooton ke saath chhedchhad ke aarope nahin lagaae gaye
 Investigation agency does not have a strong case
 abhiyojan paksh se is par koi jawaab nahin aayaa ki jab 6 sachivon ne videshi nivesh ko manzuri di thi un par koi karrwai kyon nahin hui he, unamem se ek ko reserve bank kaa governor kyon banaaya gaya
 This is happening with d Subba Rao, who became the Governor of the Reserve Bank
 inase bhi sibiai ne 14 april 2018 ko poochtacha kii he
 After the debate between Sibbl and Singhvi, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta debated again
 unhone kaha ki ham aise abhiyukt ke saath deal kar rahe hai jo jawaab na dene kii kshamaa rakhata he
 The investigation is currently underway
 hamane hai court ke saamne halafamana diya
 It is important to inquire from them
 abhiyojan apane saare sawaal nahin batayega or poochne kaa uskaa adhikaar he
 Indrani Mukherjee and Peter Mukherjee are accused in the murder of Sheena Vora and are in jail
 shina indrani kii beti thi jo 2012 main gaayab ho gai
 It is later revealed that he has been murdered
 2015 main indrani mukherjee kii giraftaar hui or peter mukherjee bhi giraftaar hue
 Will he have so much weight when he becomes a witness in any other case that Chidambaram should be arrested
 yah sawaal baar baar congress kii taraf se uthaaya ja rahaa he
 Tusshar Mehta said that we are dealing with intelligent man
 ye acha he
 Chidambaram is intelligent
 isliye bhi unhen jail janaa chahie
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has said that i am not talking about the law but sometimes the process goes wrong

 In fact, social networking sites, Google, bloggers, youtube and even film critics are questioning its originality
 is film ke kai drishyon ke filmakan main duusare filmon ke seen kii hu-ba-hu nakal kii gai he
 The film's original screenplay looks very similar to the 1993 film Benny and June starring Johnny Depp in which a mentally handicapped girl falls in love with an eccentric person
 barfi main priyanka chopra us kirdaar main jahaan unhen barfi yani ranbir kapur se pyaar ho jaataa he jo ek goonga or baharaa ladke ke kirdaar main hai
 Apart from this, there are many similarities in this film
 
 
 film main hansate-hansate lotpot karne sidhiyon vaala drishy iskaa ek udhaaharan he
 In the film, Ranbir swings up the stairs and the police try to pull him
 is drishy ko bhi baster kitons kii 1922 kii film ‘cops’ se liya gaya he
 Not only this, in one scene, Priyanka Chopra and Ranbir Kapoor sit on the side of the road and keep a nail on the road to puncture the tires of the coming vehicles
 ye seen takeshi kitaano nirdeshit japani film ‘kikusiro’ se uthaaya gaya he
 At one point in Barfi, the police are lying behind Ranbir and he runs away on a bicycle to avoid them

 There is a scene in which Ileana d'cruz's mother takes her to the woods and shows a wood-cutting man that she loved him and wanted to run away with him

 Barfi is very similar to Hollywood film 'benny & June' and Korean film 'oasis'
 iske gane main preetam kaa mujeec, compoger yen tearson kii do dhunon (2001 kii film emily main) kaa mixchar he
 Ranbir's nasal twitching for Priyanka's slight laugh is taken from 'singing in the Rain'

 For the happiness of autistic Priyanka, the idea of pasting paper on the eyelids and lips is Mr
 Bean's Mr

 Also, the second scene of the film where Ranbir tries to stick posters on the walls of Kolkata was picked up from Mr
 Bean's back to school episode
 aise main sawaal uthanaa lajimi he ki kya film ‘barfi’ ko auskars ke liye bhej kar thik kiya gayaahai
 It is worth noting that the film 'barfi' has been sent to the Oscars after preference for the film 'kahaani' starring Vidya Balan
 kendriya vitt mantri pranab mukherjee ne mahangaai ke mudde par vipaksh ke hamalon ko saamana kar rahi sarkaar kaa jamkar bachaav kiya
 He said that the government is constantly trying to deal with inflation
 saath hi mukherjee ne desh main badhati mahangaai ke liye vaishvik aarthik sthiti ko bhi jimmedaar tehraaya
 Responding to a heated debate on rising inflation, Mukherjee told the Lok Sabha that while discussing inflation 'we are not only debating our economy but also discussing the global economy
 'mukherjee ne shuukravaar ko kaha, 'koi bhi desh aaj yah nahin kah saktaa ki ham alag-thalag pad gaye hai
 Events in any part of any country can transform themselves into an international crisis
 ' unhone udhaaharan diya ki kaise aavashyak vastuon kii keemton ne pichley do se teen saal main aasmaan ko chhua
 Mukherjee said, 'today when we are discussing inflation in Parliament, this Parliament which is the fourth largest economy in the world, 1
 2 arab logon kii numaaindgi karne vaali or jisaki arthvyavastha kareeb 20 kharab dollar he
 We cannot turn our eyes away from global events
 'unhone kaha ki sarkaar mahangaai ke dabaav ke prati bhaleebhanti jaagruk he or vikaas ke aankadon main teji laane ke liye bhi utsuk he
 Mukherjee admitted that overall inflation is "dangerously close to double digits" but food inflation has come down for the last two months
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar maujuuda vittiya varsh kii samaapti tak samgr mahangaai ko paanch se chah pratishat tak laane kii soch rahi he
 The Union Finance Minister warned of linking development with inflation
 unhone kaha, 'mahangaai or vikaas ke bich koi sambandh nahin he
 We must stop inflation and achieve high growth rates
 'mukherjee ne poocha, 'ham badhati mahangaai se lagaataar nipatane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 We have to meet together to discuss the issue of subsidies
 yadi sarkaar har ek vastu par prayek vyakti ko sabsidi detii rahi to vikaas kaary kaise sampann honge
 'he said that if the international situation had been more helpful, we might have been in a better position and could give more concessions to the people
 mukherjee ke jawaab se bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke netritv vaali vipakshi partiyaan santusht nahin huin or unhone sadan kaa bahirgaman kiya
 Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj said that Mukherjee's answer is stale and it will not harm the common man
 iske baad loksabhaa kii adhyaksh mira kumaar ne shor-sharabe ke bich sadan kii kaarywahi din bhar ke liye sthagit kar di
 It is noteworthy that the discussion on inflation started on Thursday by Gurudas Dasgupta, senior leader of Communist Party of India (CPI), but due to lack of time, Mukherjee could not give his reply on the same day
 dilli hoicourt ne aaj kaha ki jama masjid ke shahi imam saiyad ahamed bukhari dwaara apane putr ko naayab imam namit karne se judaa samaaroh ‘dastarbandi’ yojit karne kaa matlab unki niyukti nahin he
 a bench of Chief Justice g Rohini and Justice RS Endlaw made the remarks after hearing the arguments of the Center, Delhi Waqf Board and the petitioners and said that in such a situation there is no need to stop the function
 yachikakartaon ne is samaaroh ke aayojan ko chunauti di thi
 The court also said that under the Waqf Board Act 1995, the law only provides for one Mutawalli (manager) of the Waqf and there is no provision for appointing an Imam of Waqf property, even if it is a mosque
 peeth ne kaha, hamaara yah mat he ki yachikakartaon kii ore se yah daleel die jane par ki moulana syed ahamed bukhari ko kanoon yaa anya baton ke tahat apane putr ko naayab imam namit karne kaa koi adhikaar nahin he or jiskaa dilli vakf board ne samarthan bhi kiya he, aisi sthiti main 22 november 2014 ko nirdhaarit dastarbandi samaaroh par agar roak nahin bhi lagati he tab iskaa aashay moulana syed ahamed bukhari ke putr ko jama masjid kaa naayab imam namit yaa niyukt karnaa nahin hoga
 The court said, therefore, we do not consider it necessary to issue an interim order restraining it
 adaalat ne bukhari ke jama masjid main samaaroh yojit karne par roak nahin lagaayi
 The petitioners demanded a stay on the ceremony at the Jama Masjid
 ucch nyaayalay ne kaha ki imam or unka parivaar pichley kai vashare se ise apane awaas ke rup main upyog kar rahaa he
 The court said, however, that it is clarified that the conduct of the ceremony and appointing the younger son of Maulana Syed Ahmad Bukhari or any other person as the Nayab Imam of Jama Masjid will be the subject of future orders in this petition and it will be in favor of some Does not confer rights or special stakes
 adaalat ne bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan, dilli sarkaar, didie, emsidi, nagar police, vakf board, sibiai ke saath bukhari ko notice jari kiya or unka jawaab maanga
 The matter will now be heard on 28 January 2015
 peeth ne yah bhi kaha ki vakf board kii ore se is bare main koi jawaab nahin aayaa he ki usne jama masjid par kisi adhikaar yaa nirikshan kaa upyog nahin kiya or usne moulana syed ahamed bukhari ko ukt masjid kii aay kyon lene di or koi karrwai kyon nahin kii
 The bench was hearing three pils in this regard
 inamen imam kii ore se apane putr ko naayab imam niyukt karne ko chunauti di gai he
 Significantly, pils in this regard were filed by Suhail Ahmed Khan, Ajay Gautam and lawyer VK Anand
 inamen kaha gaya tha ki jama masjid dilli vakf board kii sampatti he or iske ek karmchaaree ke taur par bukhari apane putr ko naayab imam namit nahin kar sakate hai
 During the debate on these three petitions yesterday, the Center and the Waqf Board had said in court that there is no legal recognition on behalf of the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid to make his son Naib Imam and his successor
 adaalat dwaara board se is bare main kanoonee sthiti spasht karne ke bare main kahe jane par vakf board ne kaha ki vah jald hi baithak karegaa or bukhari ne jo kiya he uske liye unke khilaaf karrwai kii jaaegi
 Earlier, the Center had said that this mosque of the Mughal period is the property of the Waqf and it has to decide how the succession rule applies to designating the new Shahi Imam which has been challenged

 Amarinder Singh (@capt_amarinder) July 16, 2019 dilli kii ek adaalat ne vivaah se pehle yon sambandh ko 'aniatik' or 'prayek dharmik mat' ke khilaaf bataate hue kaha he ki vivaah karne ke vaayade ke aadhaar par do vayaskon ke liye yon sansarg kaa prayek krity balaatkaar nahin ho jaataa he
 Additional Sessions Judge Virendra Bhat also said that any woman, especially an adult, educated and office goer who performs sexual intercourse on the assurance of marriage, does so 'at her own risk'
 nyaayadhish ne kaha, meri raay main vivaah ke aashwaasan par do vayaskon ke bich hone vaale younachaar kaa prayek krity aparaadh nahin ho jaataa he, yadi baad main ladkaa is vaayade ko puraa nahin karata he
 He said, 'when an adult, educated and office going woman dedicates herself to sexual acts towards her friend or colleague on the assurance of getting married, she does so at her own risk
 use apane is krity ke bare main samajhnaa chahie or yah bhi jaananaa chahie ki ladke dwaara apane vaayade ko puraa karne kii koi guarantee nahin he
 The judge said, he may or may not do so
 use yah samajhnaa chahie ki vah ek aise krity main sanlipt ho rahi he jo aniatik hi nahin, balki prayek dharm ke niyamon ke bhi khilaaf he
 No religion in the world allows sexual acts before marriage
 adaalat ne multinational company main kaam karne vaale is vyakti ko balaatkaar ke aarope se bari karte hue yah tippanee kii
 The police arrested a 29-year-old resident of Punjab, a month after the woman lodged a complaint
 yah mahila ek nijee company main prashasnic kaam kar rahi thi
 In May 2011, the woman filed a complaint against the young man for rape
 is mahila ne apni shikaayat main aarope lagaaya tha ki july, 2006 main website par internet ke jariye is yuvak ke sampark main ai thi or iske baad aaropee ne vivaah karne kaa vaayada karte hue kai baar usase shaareerik sambandh sthapit kiye
 According to the complaint, when she became pregnant in 2008, the young man pressured her to get an abortion instead of marrying him and said that he would marry her once her sisters got married
 is mahila ne police se yah bhi kaha ki uski bahanon kii shaadi hone ke baavjood usne uske saath vivaah nahin kiya
 Instead he and his parents abused and tortured her
 lekin aaropee ne mukademe kii sunwaayee ke dauraan mahila ke daawey kaa virodh kiya or kaha ki soshal netwarking ke jariye ve dost bane or iske baad kabhi-kabhi milte the, lekin usne kabhi bhi uske saath younachaar nahin kiya
 Taking cognizance of the alleged statement of this young man, the court said that the woman has the intelligence to understand the morality and the outcome of her act
 isliye yuvak dwaara uske kisi tarah kaa bharosa dekar gumraah kiye jane kii koi sambhaavna nahin he
 The court said that there is no evidence in the record to show that she later agreed to the act on the basis of the promise of getting married otherwise she does not give her consent for it
 nyaayadhish ne kaha, 'main samajhataa hum ki ek ladki ke liye ek ladke ke sirf yah kehane maatr se uske saath is aadhaar par younachaar main shaamil hona uchit nahin he ki vah uskaa pati banane ja rahaa he or uske saath younachaar main lipt hone main kuch buraai bhi nahin he
 In such a situation the girl has to consider the good and bad aspects of such act and then she should decide whether she should give her body to the boy or not
 ' The court said that he himself is not satisfied with the victim's statement that he was misled on the promise of marriage and on the basis of this, he agreed to the sexual act with the young man

 duniya kaa sabase khoonkhaar aatanki rahaa osama bin laden kaa bachapan or shuruaati jindagi kaaphi acchhee thi
 He was a smart and very shy boy in reading and writing
 20 saal kii umr tak uskaa aatank se dur-dur tak koi lenaa-dena nahin tha
 This was told by Laden's mother Alia Ghanem
 alqaida sargana ladenki maut ke kareeb saat saal baad pehali baar media ke saamne ain ghanem ne kaha ki jab osama bin laden saudi arab ke jedda kii king abdullajeej uniwarsity main iconomics kii padhai kar rahaa tha, tabhi kuch logon ke sampark main aayaa, jinhone uskaa brinwash kar diya
 After this, he started walking on the path of radicalism and terror
 iske baad aage chalakar yahi duniya kaa sabase khoonkhaar aatanki ban gaya tha, jisko america ne 2008 main pakistan main maar giraaya tha
 In an interview to 'the Guardian' newspaper, Ghanem said that when Laden was 20 years old, he was very strong and a good man of heart, but later he had suddenly changed
 jedda kii king abdullajeej uniwarsity main padhai ke dauraan hi laden kattarpanthi bana tha
 Shortly after Laden's birth, Ghanem divorced her first husband and remarried
 ab unka ek parivaar he
 Much time has passed since the death of Laden, but Ghanem still remembers him
 wo kahati hai ki laden unki pehali aulad tha or vah kaaphi sharmila tha
 Laden loved them very much
 ghanem ne vardi pahane osama bin laden kii tasviir aaj bhi apane paas rakhi hui he
 Ghanem says that while studying at King Abdullaziz University, Ladenki met a man named Abdullah Azam, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, who was exiled from Saudi Arabia and later became Osama's religious leader
 unhone bataaya ki uniwarsity ke logon ne laden ko badal diya tha or vah ek alag tarah kaa aadmi ban gaya
 When Ghanem was asked if he ever felt that his son would become a jihadist, he said, "it never came to my mind
" jab hamen isaki jaankaree hui ki laden aatanki ban gaya he, tab hamako bahut dukh hua
 i didn't want it to happen to anyone else
 usne sab kuch is tarah kyon barbaad kar diya
 'ghanem last saw Laden in Afghanistan in 1999 and went to meet him twice
 us samay osama qandahar ke thik baahar apane thikaane main rah rahaa tha
 Osama bin Laden arrived in Afghanistan in the 1980s to fight against the Russian occupation
 ghanem or unke duusare pati ke bete hasan kaa kahana he ki shuruyaat main laden se jo bhi miltaa tha, wo uskaa bahut sammaan karata tha
 Earlier we were also proud of him
 yahaan tak ki saudi sarkaar bhi uske saath achche rishte rakhti thi, lekin phir baad main uske aatank kaa cheharaa saamne aayaa or sab kuch badal gaya
