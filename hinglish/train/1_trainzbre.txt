bihar main bijepi banaam rajd kaa he sidhaa muqablarghuvansh prasad jadyu ko res main bhi nahin maanate
 Describing Bharatiya Janata Party's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi as 'dictator', RJD MP Raghuvansh Singh said that the main contest in Bihar is between RJD and BJP
 namo par nishaanaa sadhate hue raghuvansh ne kaha, 'bhaajapa main modi ko lekar afratfari machi he
 Modi was not getting a safe seat anywhere, because of this Murali Manohar Joshi was sent to Kanpur
 bhaajapa main mache andruni kalah par party ko gherte hue unhone kaha ki bhaajapa main varisht netaaon ko darkinar kiya ja rahaa he
 Nobody is listening to Advani, senior leaders like Jaswant Singh were not given tickets
 jis party main bujurgo kaa sammaan nahin he, wo desh ko aage kaise le jane kaa daawa kar sakati he'
 It is common for Ramkripal to leave the party: When asked about several leaders, including Raghuvansh Ramkripal Yadav, leaving the party, the senior RJD leader said that there is nothing unusual in this
 'chunaav main ek seat hoti he or kai log tikat ke daavedaar hote hai
 Not everyone can get a ticket
 kuch log sabar karte hai or kuch log vyagr ho jate hai'
 Raghuvansh said, 'this situation is not only in the RJD, but in every party'

 bharat main paanch rupee main milane vaali yah davaaiyaan videshon main 8 se 32 dollar tak main bikati hai
 This is the reason why these medicines are illegally sent by courier in the name of other items and then they are used as drugs
 tippaniyan Hariom Gandhi, Gujarat zonal director of Narcotics Control Bureau, says that the demand for these medicines is high because people have become addicted to them
 inkaa jo impect he or effect he vah ek tarah se regular drug kii tarah se he or inkaa nuksaan bhi regular drug jaisaa hi he

 It is very cheap in India, so it is in great demand online
 videshon main anadhikrut rup se bheji jane par yah blake market main milti hai
 These medicines, which are available in India for five rupees, are sold abroad for 8 to 32 dollars
 yahi kaaran he ki yah davaaiyaan duusari vastuon ke naam par gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se courier se bheji jaati hai or phir unka drugs ke taur par istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The comments narcotics control beuro ke gujarat ke jonal diarector hariom gandhi kaa kahana he ki in dawaaiyon kii demand kaaphi zyada he kyonki log inke edict ho chuke hai
 The effect and effect that they have is similar to that of a regular drug and their loss is also like regular drug

 On August 7, three cleaners of the Delhi Jal Board were killed while cleaning sewer in Lajpat Nagar, Delhi
 jabaki ek safaikarmi ko gambhir halaat main aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 These workers were cleaning a sewer line near the Kabir Ram temple in Lajpat Nagar
 siver ke andar jahrili gas kii chapet main aane se teenon karmchaaree behosh ho gaye
 When India forced Australia to a draw in Steve Waugh's Farewell Test eight years ago, Matthew Angel wrote in the Guardian, "some new stars are shining in the sky of cricket
" bharat ke madhya kram main khuli ankhon se is taramandal ko dekha ja saktaa he-rahul dravid, main of da siries, sachin tendulkar, ve
 V
 es
 Laxman and Sourav Ganguly
 aisa lagata he ki aane vaale varshon main ye hi test cricket ko roshan karenge
 'and the same happened
 in sab ne milakar bharat ko ek dashak ke bheetar cricket kaa sartaaj bana diya
 But when he returned to Australia this winter, the entire country was shocked to see him
 nae josh se tarotaaja australian team ne bhartiya sitaron kii chamak ko andhere main badal daalaa
 Some believe that the appreciation of Indians regarding Tendulkar, Dravid and Laxman goes to the extent of cynicism
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki logon kii bhavanaaen ab inke patan kii aahat de rahi hai
 Despite this, it cannot be denied that he had reversed the fortunes of a team that had achieved nothing but lifetime sporadic success
 masalan, kuch tathyon par gaur karen: november 1996 main lakshmana ke antarrashtriya test main pravesh se pehle bharat ne 299 match khele, 55 jite or 98 haare
 Since then, there have been 163 matches in which the Indian team has won 57 and lost 49
 yadi england or australia main haar nahin hoti, to shaayad yah aankada or asardaar hota
 In the Test matches in which the three played together, the trio scored 67 centuries, most of which played a central role in the victories over the last decade and helped wash away the poor performance of the Indian team in other countries
 chintaa kii baat he ki puraane bure din laut rahe hai or ballebaaji ladkadaa rahi he
 All those weaknesses are now visible in this team, from which India was once recognized
 phir aage kaa rasta kya he? jaahir he, team main taazgi laane ke liye nae chehron ko laayaa janaa nirnaayak hoga
 Tendulkar, Dravid and Laxman may announce their retirement at any time, by identifying the players who will replace them, they should be given enough time to consider themselves part of this team
 chunki ab darshak se lekar visheshgy sabhi, test maichon main dhoni kii captaini par sawaal khadey kar rahe hai, lihaaja dusron kii netritv kshamta ko bhi parakhnaa hoga
 In some circles, vice-captain Virender Sehwag is being named, but there is no point in giving captaincy to a man who is 33 years old and three years older than the current captain
 iske alaava, sahvaag ne haal ke maheenon main koi khaas pradarshan bhi nahin kiya he jisase yah mana ja sake ki paanch divasiy maichon main ve is jimmedaari ko nibhaa paaenge
 If this thing arose a few months ago, Gautam would have been a natural choice, but on one hand he is weak due to poor form and some chaotic statements related to the advantages gained on the home ground
 agar badlaav karnaa hi he to gambhir iske baavjood sabase behatar vikalp honge, jinke saath under-19 kii abhootpurv captaini karne vaale 23 saal ke viraat kohli khadey hai, haalanki vah ab bhi apni jagah banane main lage hue hai
 Whatever it is, changes have to be made in the top order
 pichley 12 maah main gambhir or sahvaag kaa pradarshan khaas nahin rahaa he or sahvaag ne vaise bhi madhm kram main aane kii apni ichha jataa di he basharte koi jagah vahaan khaali hoti he
 With the old ball at number six, he can behave in the same way as he has done with the new ball
 mat bhuuliye ki 2001 main dakshin africa ke bloemphontin main apana pehla shatak unhone chhathwein kram par ballebaaji karte hue hi thoka tha
 Apart from Kohli, there are many other candidates to support Gambhir
 mumbai ke 23 varshiya openar ajinkya rahane kaa pratham shrenee cricket main 68
 47 is average and they will take over their responsibility
 england main simit overon ke dauraan unhen parkhaa gaya tha or jinhone bhi unhen dekha, unka maananaa he ki yah lambii res kaa ghoda he
 Rahane had some very attractive strokes in that match
 team kaa dil hota he madhya kram or australia main achaanak is dil kii dhadkan ruk gai thi
 Players with specific abilities are needed everywhere in this sequence and players should be given a chance in this order
 philhal, tisare number par aisa aadmi chahie jo pari ko sambhaal sake or saath hi teji se ran bator sake
 Kohli has done this job well in ODI cricket and his claim to this number has been strengthened due to his strong performance in Australia Test
 chauthe number par tendulkar kii jagah jab bhi jo aayega usamen majboot stroke lagane kii kshamta honi chahie
 Ian Chappell is not the only one to consider Mumbai's 24-year-old Rohit Sharma as the most talented batsman of today
 unki kshamta par kisi ko bhi shaq nahin
 He could not find a place in the World Cup last year, although he has proved himself in all the opportunities that have come his way in ODI cricket since then
 test team main unhen liye jane main kii gai deree puure bhartiya cricket ke liye nuksaandaayak hogi
 Apart from this, another decisive place is number six, where Laxman has shown his valor many times
 nichle kram main ballebaaji karnaa sabase mushkil kaam he
 a batsman needs a shield against fire-throwing bowling at this location, secondly he has to be confident so that he can perform naturally, as did Laxman with 23-year-old Ishant Sharma in Mohali in October 2010
 
 is bhoomika ko nibhaane ke liye khilaadi ko shantchitt hona chahie
 As an example, 24-year-old batsman Cheteshwar Pujara's innings from middle-order Saurashtra can be remembered in Australia Test a year and a half ago
 paanchaven sthaan par ek or baayen haath kaa ballebaaj chahie
 If Yuvraj Singh becomes eligible to play by the start of the next season, he will have to give his last chance to claim this spot
 yadi aisa nahin hota to uttar pradesh ke 25 varshiya suresh raina pehle se taiyaar baithe hai
 Raina remains unconvinced against short ball, he has also been criticized a lot, but even better players have had to face such problems
 khaskar bharat kii fielding main raina kendriya bhoomika main rahete hai or kisi ne aaj tak mehnat karne kii unki kshamta par sawaal nahin khadaa kiya
 Another interesting option is 22-year-old Abhinav Mukund from Tamil Nadu opener
 videshi maidaanon par unka anubhav acha he or gharelu record bhi jabardast he
 He can be considered ready for the Indian Test team after playing a series in familiar conditions
 australia main hui haar par kohli ke alaava agar koi santvanaa dene vaala he to ve hai 27 saal ke riddhimaan saaha
 They can also bat in difficult conditions, which they proved in Australia
 yadi dhoni bhavishya main kabhi hatate hai, to isamen koi shaq nahin ki wicketiper ballebaaj ke taur par saaha kaa behatar vikalp ho sakate hai
 Harbhajan Singh is also looking for a comeback, but the selectors are seriously right-handed off-break bowler 25-year-old R
 aswin ke bare main sochna hoga
 62 in Australia
 77 kii dar se 9 wicket kaa unka record bhale hi bahut prabhaavshaalee na ho, lekin tab aapako muthaiya muralidharan ke bare main bhi sochna chahie ki unhone kaise vahaan kii paristhitiyon se sangharsh kiya (paanch test main 75
 12 wickets at the rate of 41)
 of -spinneron ke liye vahaan halaat hameshaa aise hi rahe hai, haalanki gharelu maidan par aswin ko bharat kii ore se phiraki akraman kii kaman de di jaani chahie kyonki ve uske laayak hai
 As far as fast bowling is concerned, the situation is more difficult
 jahir khan ne pehali baar australia main test khelaa, lekin unki res ab bahut lambii nahin rah gai he
 Ishant Sharma could not improve as expected
 24 saal ke umesh yadav ne bhi khud main koi bharosa nahin jagaaya
 He and 22-year-old Varun Aaron should be asked to focus on fast bowling, while 25-year-old Praveen Kumar and 27-year-old Irfan Pathan can try swings if needed
 kul milakar kah sakate hai ki abhi zyada ummiden lagane kii jarurat nahin
 Things will wobble before things get better and one thing is sure that Indian cricket will be left out of the country by ignoring the youth
 test cricket main apane pair jamaane main lakshmana ko 20 match lag gaye, jaahir he unke baad aane waalon ko bhi to utana vakt or mauka dena hoga taaki ve usamen ram saken

 com / 11zv2zcrvb desh ke pradhan nyaayadhish esech kapaadiya ne kaha he ki yadi nyaayadhishon kii karravaayiyon or nirnyon kii rachanaatmak aalochana hoti he to unhen inhen najrandaaj nahin karnaa chahie, kyonki aisi hi samikshaon se kanoon kaa vikaas hota he
 Kapadia said this on Tuesday when he was releasing the book of the leading legalist TR Andhyarujina, 'the Kesavanand Bharti Case: The Untold Story of Struggle for Supremacy by the Supreme Court and Parliament'
 kapaadiya ne kaha, "ham nyaayadhish apni karravaayiyon or nirnyon kii baar dwaara kii jane vaali rachanaatmak aalochana se nahin darate
 "kapadia regretted that the senior advocate was too much engaged in his professional work rather than focusing on the development of statutory and constitutional law
 pradhan nyaayadhish ne is mudde par kisi charchaa kaa hissaa banane se inkaar kar diya ki nyaayadhishon ko bahes vaale muddon main nahin ulajhna chahie
 However, the book contains details of tensions and conflicts in the Kesavananda Bharati case - not only between rival parties, but also between judges
 unamem se kuch ke vichaar pehle se tay the, kyonki ek to ve purv ke maamalon main nyaayadhish rah chuke the or duusare yah ki sarkaar ne unka chayan kiya tha
 Andhyarujina said that the book provides a true picture of how the case developed and how it was dealt with and somehow reached a decision in a dubious manner
 is maamle main andhyarugina ke tark unki smritiyon or maamle ke vakil ke rup main unke dwaara taiyaar kii gai tippaniyon par tathaa baad main unke dwaara liye gaye maamle se sambandhit kuch nyaayadhishon ke saakshaatkaar par aadhaarit hai
 In this case, the Supreme Court had said that Parliament cannot tamper with the basic structure of the Constitution
 kya pashchim bengal main mashhoor vidyasagar sethu kaa udghaatan purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne kiya tha? agar congress kii maane to haa
 It is different that this bridge was inaugurated on 10 October i
e
 today, in 1992, while Indira Gandhi was killed on 31st of the month of October, just six years before that
 ji haa,congress nipane aadhikarik fasebuk pej par aaj # thisdaythatyear ke saath kai post kin
 In one, he referred to Kailash Satyarthi receiving the 2014 Nobel Prize on this day, and in 2008, the then Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee's agreement with the US firm to sell nuclear technology in India
 isi hashtag ke tahat congress ne likhaa ki aaj hi ke din 1992 main pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne 1992 main vidyasagar sethu kaa udghaatan kiya tha
 8 in the morning
 15 baje likhi gai is post ko karte vakt congress kaa soshal media cell bhul gaya ki indira gandhi nahin, us vakt narsinha raav pradhanmantri the or unhone hi is sethu kaa udghaatan kiya tha
 Indira Gandhi was killed six years ago in 1984 and that too was the month of October
 jaahir he ye post hote hi yugers ne congress kii khinchaai karnaa shuru kar diya ki aakhir kaiseindira gandhiis sethu kaa udghaatan kar sakati hai or congress kaa media cell agar itihaas ko janata ko bataanaa chahta he to pehle wo khud ko apadet kyon nahin karata
 Around 12 o'clock, the Congress realized its mistake and then the post was edited that PV Narasimha Rao inaugurated the bridge in 1992, while the foundation stone was laid on 20 May 1972 by Indira Gandhi
 ecreesbucuger ne chutki lete hue poocha ki 1992 main indira ji ko nimantran dene swarg main koun gaya tha
 The special thing is that despite editing Facebook posts, there is an option to view his old posts
 is post main bhi congress kii chook uski edit history main dekhi ja sakati he lekin acchhee baat ye he ki congress ko apni galati kaa jald ahsaas ho gaya or usne use sudhaar bhi liya

 trump or kim ko ek-duusare ke thikaanon se parhejaitani badi duniya main 10 bai 10 kii koi ek aisi jagah tay nahin ho paa rahi he, jahantrump kii kim se mulakataho sake
 To end the threat of the Third World War hovering over the world, these two leaders are to meet in late May or early June
 magar trump ko uttar korea se parhez he or kim ko america jane se khauf
 South Korea, Japan, Russia and China have reservations about the security agencies of both countries
 lihaaza european desh sweden kii rajdhani stoffhome par charchaa kii gai
 Not capable of a long flight, Kim's plan, though neutral, has a good relationship with Sweden
 magar yahaan bhi ek dikkat he
 The US President will then reach Sweden with his airforce-one aircraft
 isamen to bahut si khubiyaan hai
 There is no effect of missile attack on this either
 magar kim kaa adhikarik plane jise 'air force un' kehete hai wo to is kaabil bhi nahin ki bina dobaaraa tel bhare 3200 kimi se upar kaa safar tay kar sake
 Kim has the plan of Baba Adam's time, there is no doubt that Kim has prepared 13 thousand km missiles
 6-6 parmaanu bam or naa jane kitne hathiyaaron kaa zakhira bana liya he
 But even today, Kim Baba uses the aircraft of Adam's time and this official plane of Kim can only fly up to a radius of 2000 miles at a time
 isse aage jane ke liye vimaan main dobaar tel bharna padataa he
 Now for one, Kim is afraid of the plane and the other is the danger of security, in such a situation, within a distance of 2000 miles or 3200 km, he will have to finalize some place where Kim and Trump can meet
 mongolia main ho sakati he kim-trump kii mulakatnarth korea ke 3200 kimi ke daayre main jo desh aate hai unamem china, japan, rus, taiwan, dakshin korea or mongolia shaamil hai
 The US would not like to meet in China and Russia, and in South Korea and Japan, Kim is in danger of his safety
 taiwan par kim ko itminan nahin he
 So by taking Mongolia only one country is left, where this biggest politics of the present time can be met
 badi baat ye he ki mongolia se donon deshon ke rishte bhi thik hai
 However, the experience of such large visits to Mongolians is slightly less
 mongolian adhikariyon se mili trump or kim ke dootkyonki aksar ye desh global ghatnaon par zyaada pratikriya nahin detaa he
 But it is being told that Mongolia is taking a lot of interest in organizing this meeting on its soil
 is silsile main mongolian raashtrapati khaltama batulga ke chif of staff necorean rajdoot or yuaosdhikariyon se mulaakaat bhi kii he
 The great thing is that Mongolia is such an option where Kim Jong will neither have any security risk nor object to traveling
 duusare vikalpon par bhi ho rahaa he vichaar!abhi tak tay nahin he mulaakaat kii jagahmongolia, sweden ke alaava switzaraland bhi ek vikalp ho saktaa he
 Because not only did Kim do her schooling here
 balki usase donon mulkon ke behatar rishte bhi hai
 All the experts are also agreeing that this meeting of the two leaders should be held at some healthy place
 haalanki khabar he ki agar kahin baat nahin bani to jhopadinuma ye neeli imaaraten meeting ke liye tay kii ja sakati he
 Those are called Panmunjom, which is on the border of North and South Korea
 philhal is par vichaar nahin kiya ja rahaa he kyonki naa to north korea or naa hi america is baatcheet main kisi tisare kaa dakhal chahta he
 Both terrorists have collapsed in an encounter between security forces and militants on Friday morning in Sopore, Jammu and Kashmir
 haalanki iske baad sthaneey logon or suraksha balon ke bich jhadap ho gai
 It is said that after the terrorists were killed, a large number of youths from the nearby village gathered in the encounter area
 unhone suraksha balon par pathar bhi phenke
 The police released tear gas shells to disperse the crowd
 bataaya jaataa he ki suraksha balon ko aatankiyon ke chhipe hone kikhufia jaankarimili thi, jiske baad bomai gaanv main search oparation shuru kiya gaya
 After an hour-long investigation, the terrorists were found hiding in a house
 isse pehle kii suraksha bal ke jawan aage badhate, aatankiyon se duusari ore se firing shuru kar di
 In time, the security forces also started retaliating
 is dauraan dononatankiyon komaar diya gaya he
 The terrorists are related to Hizbul Mujahideen

 input language lekin yah bhi sach he ki agar rahul gandhi pad nahin chhodte hai, to congress kaa ubar paanaa mushkil hoga, kyonki aisalagata he ki rahul kii aguwai main congress apana sarvshereshth pradarshan kar chuki he
 At the time of the Gujarat assembly elections, when Rahul Gandhi was made the Congress president and the BJP was given a tough fight
 karnataka main congress ne sarkaar banaai or iske baad disambar, 2018 main madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main chunaav jitkar sarkaar banaai
 But after that Rahul could not succeed in making a successful strategy in the Lok Sabha elections 2019 and also lost the gains in the three states
 ab yah rahul gandhi yaa unki team yaa donon kii galati thi, isaki samiksha party ko khud hi kerani hogi, lekin yah tay he ki uttar pradesh main SP-BSP-RLD gathbandhan main shaamil na hona badi ranneetik chook thi
 Similarly in other states, Congress could not be reached with regional parties
 duusari ore, BJP ne bada dil dikhaate hue apni jiti hui siten bhi chhodkar bihar main JDU se gathbandhan kiya, maharashtra main bhi shivasena ke saath isi tarah gathbandhan kiya gaya
 So the question is why those who gave advice to Rahul Gandhi did not show big heart, while he had also announced the leadership of the alliance in the name of opposition unity
 aisa lagata he, rahul gandhi bhale hi 15 saal se raajnneeti main hai, lekin abhi vah jamini hakeekat se koson dur hai or ve aankadon kii hakeekat nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 But the biggest crisis facing the Congress is that they have no face other than Gandhi family which can attract the common people
 to phir bagdor kise di jaae?mujhe aisa lagata he ki congress or gandhi parivaar ke saamne ab dil bada vakt karne kaa samay aa gaya he
 The party should command them to such a person who has the ability to run all kinds of electoral figures, political moves and organization
 jo yah maanata ho ki congress hi aisi party he jisamen sabhi vichaaron ko samahit kiya ja saktaa he
 My point may seem a bit strange, but according to me at this time, Yogendra Yadav has the greatest ability to take over the reins of Congress
 vah nehru kii samaajawaadee soch se bhi ittefaq rakhte hai
 He will also not make a mistake in speaking Hindi
 vah congress ke pradarshan se niraash bhi hai or unka maananaa he ki vartmaan congress hi BJP kaa vikalp banane main sabase bada roda he
 He talks of making the Congress an old Congress, and this potential is not seen in any Congress leader, at least for now
 lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki yogendra yadav hi congress ke cheharaa ban jaaen
 Rahul Gandhi, calling himself PM candidate, should travel all over the country and Yogendra Yadav does the work of strategizing for them, who raise the voice of the farmer by connecting the land and also run the organization related to these issues
 iske alaava congress ke duusare sabhi bade netaaon ko unhen unke pradesh bhej dena chahie
 All of them should go to their respective states and work to strengthen the Congress organization on the advice of Yogendra Yadav
 congress ko phir se khadaa karnaa he to itnaa bada to dil karnaa hi padegaa

 magar ye bhav hamen kahaan le jate hai, kabhi sochaa he? darasal inke saath ham apane aamazgaah tak kii yatra karte hai
 Amazgah is a Persian word meaning target place (paramdham)
 aamazgaah main teen maarmik kahaniyaan hai
 It is not so easy to understand these stories of Manoj Rupra
 iske liye aapako lekhak kii style, bhashaa, kirdaar or unke halaat ke saath hi unke bhaavon kii gaharaai main bhi utarana hoga
 The first story 'amazgah' flows between the present era and the past
 isamen hasarat or makasad hai
 These are all connected to the stars of music
 jab aapaki ruh aapako kisi makasad ke liye pukaarti he or uske kareeb pahunchakar bhi agar paristhitiyaan aapke vipareet ho jaaen to aapako aamazgaah milegaa? is avasthaa ko bataane ke liye kahani kii yah pankti hi kaaphi he, ''ham kisi aaramgaah kii taraf nahin, balki ek aisi aamazgaah kii taraf ja rahe hai jiske bare main hamen kuch bhi andaja nahin he
 In the second story 'life Line', the writer has brought alive the depression caused by communication loss and suffocation, through three characters
 is kahani ke kirdaar itane jeevant hai ki kai jagahon par aapako paatro ke liye ghabrahat hone lagati he
 The mother, who struggles to raise two daughters, falls prey to it
 phir profeshnal or personal life un donon betiyon ko aisa todatii he ki unamem jindagi shesh nahin bachati
 We often see people who have lost their mental balance, whom we do not even like to look at as crazy
 aakhri kahani 'aag or raakh ke bich' main aise hi ek veikshipt ke kriyakalapon or uske is hashr tak pahunchane kii kahani he
 In this, you will sometimes feel the heart of the main character and sometimes you will get annoyed and angry after seeing his work
 isi ke saath kai uljhe shabdon or bhaavon ke bich aapako itani gaharaai main utarane ke liye manoj kii tarif bhi kerani hogi
 But you will be able to do this only, who will have the patience to understand these ups and downs, because this is the literature of life, the person who is drowning in it will be a star

 The government of Pakistan is now surrounded by its own people for its obstinate attitude on terrorism
 shuru se hi jhooth bol rahi paak sarkaar par media ne karaara waar kiya he
 The News has written that all claims of the Pak government are false
 duniya kahati he ki mumbai hamalon ke liye aatankwaadiyon ne pakistan kii jameen kaa istemaal kiya
 There is anecdotal evidence, which says that the terrorists took proper training in Pakistan, where there was a conspiracy and from there the control of the entire action was taken
 lekin, pakistan sarkaar he ki use kuch dikhataa hi nahin
 She is harping on the evidence
 paak sarkaar kaa ye bekaar raag ab vahaan kii media ko bhi raas nahin aa rahaa he
 a newspaper there, The News Daily, has raised many big questions in front of the government regarding the terrorism that is emerging in Pakistan
 'dinaaing da obvious' naam se likhe sampadakeey main akhbaar ne poocha he ki sarkaar bataae ki uttari or dakshini wajiristaan par pakistan kaa kabja he yaa nahin
 If Pakistan is in possession, then what does the government have to say about the terrorism spreading there
 akhbaar ne nine-ilevan ke baad purv raashtrapati musharraf ke bayaan ke hawaale se ye bhi likhaa he ki unhone hi mana tha ki desh ke andar aatanki takatein fal-phool rahi hai
 The newspaper has also ridiculed the remarks made on January 1, which said that there is no infrastructure of terrorism in Pakistan
 paak sarkaar ke jhooth kaa ek or pardaafash he akhbaar kaa ye sampadakeey
 Kahwaat is also famous that no matter how much you press the truth, it cannot be suppressed
 agar ab bhi pakistan sarkaar bahaanon kaa hatkandaa apnayegi, to ye baat tay he ki duniya ke saath-saath wo apni janata ke bich bhi kirakiri hi karavaaegi

 After the defeat in the MCD election, something similar is happening with Arvind Kejriwal
 vipakshi partiyaan aarope laga rahi hai ki wo janaadhar kho chuke hai lihaaja janata ko 'rhite tu ricol' dekar dobaaraa chunaav karavaaen
 As the Opposition's war began to clear the bjp's victory in the MCD election trends, the statements of the BJP camp started firing arrows against Kejriwal
 bijepi to bijepi, congress ne bhi unke istife kii maang kar daali
 Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari said, 'this is a reference for Kejriwal
 unhone hameshaa se 'rhite tu ricol' kii baat kii he
 They give Delhi a right to recall and start preparing to write a resignation
 'congress netaa or raashtrapati pranab mukherjee kii beti sharmishtha mukherjee ne bhi kuch yahi sur pakadaa

 Is it not moral for them to resign themselves? ''rhite tu ricol' kaa kejariwal conectionduniya ke kai chote deshon main janata ko 'rhite tu ricol' kaa haq hasil he
 But public debate on this issue in India started after 2011
 jan-lokapal bill par ramlila maidan main hue andolan ke dauraan naa sirf kejariwal balki anna hajaare ne bhi is masale ko uthaaya tha
 Both said that after the Jan Lokpal they will campaign for 'right to Recall' and 'right to Reject'
 haalanki aisa kuch hua nahin
 What is Right to Recall? 'right to Recall' is the right of the public to recall their chosen representation
 agar pratinidhi chune jane ke baad ek nishchit arsa guzarane par bhi janata apane netaa ke kaamkaaj se khush nahin he to us ilaake ke voter milakar ek arji taiyaar kar sakate hai
 If at least a quarter of the voters sign the petition, then the Election Commission can order a re-election in that area as part of a process

 However, it was not accepted both times
 2013 main lau kamishan ko chunaav sudhaaron par vichaar karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 In the report presented in 2017, the Commission also did not recommend Right to Recall

 But most of these countries are small in terms of population

 In India, this provision has been implemented at the local level in states like Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh

 i did this because i did not want any kind of connection

 yerusalem ko isroyal kii rajdhani ke taur par manyata dene ko lekar america raashtrapati donald trump aaj apane bhaashan main ahm ghoshnaa kar sakate hai
 US officials say Donald Trump may recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital in his speech Wednesday, according to news agency AP
 saath hi grih vibhaag ko is bare main nirdesh de sakate hai ki tel aviv sthit america duutavas ko pavitra shahar le jane kii prakriya ko shuru kiya jaae
 Officials said that recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital is a historical and real rather than political rhetoric
 adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki isroyal kii zyaadaatar sarkari agenciyaan or parliament tedhvive ke bajaay yerusalem main hi hai, jabaki america or anya deshon ke duutavas tel aviv main hai
 Top officials say that moving Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is a long process and Trump insisted on completion, although this is not going to happen immediately
 america ke hit main hoga trump kaa faislawhite house kaa kahana he ki raashtrapati donald trump buudhvaar ko is bare main ghoshnaa karenge
 White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president is strong about his plan
 haalanki sanders ne yah nahin bataaya ki trump kya ghoshnaa karne vaale hai
 Sanders said the president's announcement would be a better decision for the US
 haalanki america adhikariyon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki yerusalem ko isroyal kii rajdhani ke taur par manyata dene se arab jagat main tanaav paidaa ho sakate hai
 In this regard, US President Trump also spoke to Middle East leaders in this regard
 haalanki isse pehle khabar ai thi ki trump ne jerusalem ko israel kii rajdhani ke taur par manyata dene or vahaan par america duutavas sthapit karne kaa apana faisla philhal ke liye taal diya he
 An atmosphere of unrest was created about his decision and it was being described as his historic wrong step
 white house ne kaha tha ki duutavas ko tel aviv se hataane kii jo samaysima tay kii gai thi, uskaa paalan nahin kiya jayega
 Earlier, his colleagues gave public warnings for 48 hours and there were private phone calls between leaders around the world
 US consulate ne jari kiya alert, philistin kii dhamkeeyerusalem sthit america consulate ne apane karmchaariyon or unki family ko nijee str par yerusalem ke puraane shahar kii yatra na karne kii salaah di he

 is sambandh main trump buudhvaar ko ghoshnaa kar sakate hai
 israel-palestine: Jerusalem is a key issue in the israel-palestine dispute
 israel or philistin donon ise apni rajdhani bataate hai
 While Trump was considering this decision, leaders from around the world, including West Asia, issued a public warning about deviations from decades-old American policy
 israel ke raksha mantri avigdor libermaan ne trump se kaha tha ki vah is aitihaasik avasar ko haathon se jane naa den
 Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said that if Jerusalem's status is changed and another step is taken in this direction, it will be a disaster

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne buudhvaar ko rafel maamle ko lekar loksabhaa main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko gherne ke baad press conference bhi kii
 During this, he blamed the Modi government for corruption in the Rafale deal and retaliated the speech of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in Lok Sabha
 isi dauraan ek sawaal par rahul gandhi ne kaha ki haa main payalat hum, lekin mere paas karant license nahin he
 Rahul Gandhi is not the only member of his family who has the experience of flying the plane
 unke pita or purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi or unke chachaa sanjay gandhi bhi payalat rahe hai
 Rajiv Gandhi chose the career of an aviator and started from small aircraft in the region to big Boeing aircraft
 rajeev gandhi 1966 main britain se bharat laute or indian airlines main peshewar payalat kaa pad sambhala
 Rajiv Gandhi usually flew on the delhi-jaipur-agra route
 is root ko un dinon aasaan nahin mana jaataa tha
 It is said that Rajiv Gandhi was also involved in the race to become the President of Indian Airlines, but this was not possible during that time
 haalanki unhone apni koi nijee vimaan company bhi nahin kholi
 However, let us tell you that Rahul Gandhi's uncle Sanjay Gandhi was also a pilot
 kaha jaataa he ki sanjay gandhi saadagi pasand shaks the
 He used to fly aircraft in Kolhapuri chappals, whereas these slippers were not able to withstand high air pressure in the cockpit
 rajeev gandhi unhen baar-baar chetavanee bhi dete the ki ve payalat vaale juute pahan kar hi plane udaayen
 But Sanjay did not pay attention to her
 lekin kise pataa tha ki is diler shaks kii maut vimaan krash main hogi
 He died on 23 June 1980 in a plane crash
 argentina ke liye yah world cap abhi tak kisi bure sapane se kam nahin rahaa he
 Argentina where the new team could not beat Iceland in their first match and the match ended 1–1, while in the second match, Croatia's team beat Argentina 3–0
 argentina ke pehle do maichon main sarveshreshth footballron main shumaar leonal mesi bhi rang main nahin dikhe or kroeshia se haar ke baad to ab argentina par pehle hi daur se baahar hone kaa khatra bhi mandara rahaa he
 If that happens, it will probably be like Messi's dream break, playing his last World Cup
 haalanki abhi bhi argentina ke liye sab kuch khatm nahin hua he, iceland or nigeria ke bich khele gaye match main nigeria kii jeet ne argentina ko ek lifline de di he
 If luck favors Argentina and Messi, the Argentine team can still make it to the next round
 haalanki iske liye ab group di ke baaki ke maichon ke nattejey argentina ke anukool hone honge
 In the equation of Group d currently, Argentina are ranked last with 1 point, while Croatia has reached the next round with 6 points
 vahiin nigeria 3 ankon ke saath jabaki iceland 1 ank ke saath tisare sthaan par he
 Now in the last two matches of this group, Nigeria will face Argentina while Iceland will face Croatia
 aise main agar:-· kroeshia kii team iceland ko or argentina, nigeria ko haraa detii he to is sthiti main argentina 4 anko ke saath agle daur main pahunch jaaegi
 If Argentina defeats Nigeria and also wins over Iceland, Croatia, then both teams will score equal points, although Argentina have scored more goals so far, they may have to suffer the loss
 matlab vartmaan paristhiti main argentina ko apane aakhri mukaable main badi jeet ke saath apane agle daur main pahunchane kaa rasta khol sakati he
 In such a situation, it will be interesting to see if Messi can make a memorable performance to save his team and his own dream

 pichley maheene purvottar ke logon main vyaapt dehshat ko dekhte huye sarkaar 8 rajyon main twitor par pratibandh lagane ja rahi thi, kyonki sarkaar kaa maananaa tha ki purvottar ke logon ke palaayan main twitor kii bhi bhoomika thi
 The Department of Electronics and Information Technology wanted to ban Twitter and hence sought opinions from experts on how this could be done
 iske liye karnataka, andhra pradesh, tamilnadu, assam, maharashtra or uttar pradesh ko chihnit kiya gaya tha
 Sources said that the Department of Electronics and Information Technology followed the advice of the Ministry of Home Affairs stating that the messages and pictures posted on Twitter have given rise to fear and exodus
 baharhaal, rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar emke narayanan or pradhanmantri ke pramukh sachiv pulok chatarji ne is kadam ko jaruri nahin mana
 The Prime Minister's Office was of the view that 'if there is bad water coming out of some taps, then the entire colony's water supply cannot be stopped
 ’ iske hi baad nirnay liya gaya ki ek samiksha samiti kaa gathan kiya jaayegaa jo twitor jaisi website par daale gayi sandeshon par najar rakhegi
 The government had banned 310 webpages with messages and pictures provoking communal sentiments and through which panic was spread among the people of northeast living in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne shanivaar ko internet ke durupyog ke bare main charchaa kii thi or kaha ki sarkaar ek thos sibar suraksha pranali banane par kaam kar rahi he jo khataron ko dekhne, unhen kam karne or pramann jaisi vyavastha par kaam karegi
 He said that a concrete strategy is needed to deal with the propaganda going on on the social networking website
 lokapal vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar karne ke liye centre ke mantriyon or gandhivadi anna hajaare ke netritv vaale saamaajik kaaryakartaaon ke bich shanivaar ko hui sanyukt samiti kii pehali baithak main donon pakshon ke bich yah sahmati bani ki sansad kaa monsoon satr shuru hone se pehle ek pukhta vidheyak taiyaar kar liya jayega
 The meeting lasted 90 minutes under the chairmanship of Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee on behalf of the government and co-chaired by former Law Minister and senior advocate Shanti Bhushan on behalf of the society
 10 sadasyeey sanyukt samiti main shaamil saamaajik kaaryakartaaon ne baithak kii videography karaane kii maang rakhi, lekin baad main donon paksh har baithak kii audiography karaane par raji ho gaye
 The Jan Lokpal Bill prepared by social activists was introduced in the meeting
 samiti main shaamil maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri kapil sibbal ne baithak ko aitihaasik kadam qaraar diya
 He told reporters, both sides expressed their views and their views on the Lokpal Bill
 masauda vidheyak kaa taaja sanskaran (jan lokapal vidheyak) adhyaksh ko diya gaya or unhone us par gaur bhi kiya
 He said, but there has been agreement between the two sides that the draft bill prepared by the standing committee will also be discussed in the upcoming meetings
 samiti ke sabhi sadsy chaahate hai ki ek pukhta vidheyak taiyaar ho, jise sansad ke monsoon satr main pesh kiya jaae
 The next meeting of the committee will be held on 2 May
 baithak main gaiyr-sarkari numaayindon ke taur par anna hajaare, purv kanoon mantri shanti bhushan, varisht edwocket prashanth bhushan or arvind kejariwal maujuud rahe,, jabaki sarkaar kii ore se samiti ke adhyaksh pranab mukherjee ke saath-saath grahamantri pi chidambaram, maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri kapil sibbal, kanoon mantri virappa moili or salmaan khurshid ne hissaa liya
 With this bill, Anna Hazare, along with his colleagues, campaigned for five days at Jantar Mantar in Delhi, after which the government was forced to accept the demands
 aaie ek najar daalate hai ki aakhir lokapal bill ke aise koun se mudde hai, jin par sarkaar or anna ke bich vivaad ho saktaa he
 The first is the issue of judiciary
 anna or unke samarthak chaahate hai ki is bill main nyaaypalika ko bhi shaamil kiya jaae
 But according to the government the constitution does not allow this
 hajaare samarthak chaahate hai ki lokapal sabase upar ho
 He should also have the power to remove the Prime Minister and Chief Justice from the post
 lekin samvidhan ke mutabik pradhanmantri ko sirf raashtrapati hi bahumat na hone par hataa sakate hai or chif justise ko pad se hataane ke liye sansad main mahabhiyog laana padataa he
 The third issue is the Lokpal Fund
 hajaare chaahate hai ki jurmaane kii raashi lokapal fund main jamaa ho, jabaki jabt hue sara paisa ek hi sarkari fund main jaataa he
 The government claims that in such a situation every committee will start asking for its own fund
 chauthaa mudda he shikayatakarta kii javabdehi kaa
 Hazare supporters want that no action should be taken against the complainant even if the complaint is found wrong, but the government wants the complainant to have some accountability
 (input bhashaa se bhi) Many times, seeing the condition of the soldiers and the farmers, it seems that we are all stubborn that there is no need to look at them
 samasya itani badi he ki samaadhaan ke naam par pudiya pesh kar di jaati he jo media main hedline banakar gaayab ho jaati he
 Both grain and man are dispersed
 na to daam mil rahaa he na kaam mil rahaa he
 These issues are meant to condemn each other for the ruling party and the opposition, but no concrete proposal is placed among the public as to what is really going to happen, why it is missing what it is doing
 kai baar lagata he ki hamaare rajaneta, hamaare arthshaastri, system main baithe logon ne zid kar lee he ki in buniyadi sawaalon par baat nahin karnaa he, media ko har raat koi na koi theme mil jaataa he, sab kuch isi theme kii talash ke liye ho rahaa he
 Even after this, pictures from within India are being made shallow to the surface

 mughalsarai kii taraf ja rahi is malgadee ke drishy ko yaad rakhiegaa
 It is good that the political consciousness of these youth is zero or our leaders would have trembled
 bharat ke yuva murda shanti se bhare noujvaan hai jinhen bas ek naukari kaa vigyaapan dikh janaa chahie
 Colleges that have been transformed into ruins are not visible, there are no inferior teachers within the college
 hamen or aapako bhi kuch nahin dikhataa he
 We had told about the results of BA bsc, b Com and Post Graduate of Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University
 vahaan fail hone waalon kii baraat nikali he
 The university installed cameras to prevent cheating during the exam this year
 nakal to ruuk gai magar fail hone vaale or imtahaan chhodane waalon kii sankhya bataa rahi he ki ye uniwarsity kisi kaam kii nahin he
 Students who study here and do not write names know where professors come, where they teach and where only names are written, exams are passed and no studies are done
 sirf avadh uniwarsity kii baat nahin he, hamane prime time main chhapra ke jepi uniwarsity or muzaffarpur ke dow
 Ambedkar had also told the condition of Bihar University
 hamane prime time main bataaya tha ki avadh uniwarsity main chah lakh ke kareeb chaatr pariksha main shaamil hue the or inamen se assi fisadi chaatr fail ho gaye
 That means around 4 lakh 80 thousand have failed
 uniwarsity ne 19 june ko ek press relies jari kar aankadon ko aise pesh kiya he ki sab kuch acha acha dikhe
 It is written in this release that a question mark is being put on the exam
 hamane yahaan kii padhai par prashn chinh lagaaya tha ki padhai kii kya quality he ki nakal rokane par fail hone vaale kii sankhya lakhon main pahunch jaati he
 Overall, the data is marketed
 sarkaar dwaara anudaan praapt collejon ke paas pratishat or khud se chalane vaale collejon ke paas pratishat main antar bataaya gaya he
 We had added that overall, in 2017-18, BA and b
sc, b
com three-year and post-graduate level six and a half million students took the exam
 80 pratishat fail ho gaye to is hisaab se fail hone vaale chaatro kii sankhya kareeb 4 lakh 80,000 ke kareeb chaatr fail hai
 Over 80 percent of BSC third year students fail
 biessi pratham varsh main 56 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 Ganapat Sahay Post Graduate College of Sultanpur had about 300 students in the final year in mathematics but only 20-25 of these have passed
 275 ke kareeb fail ho gaye hai
 On 19 June, the Vice Chancellor held a meeting and presented the data in such a way that four lakh children failed
 hamaara jor is par he ki padhai kii quality itani ghatiya kyon he ki chaatr nakal rokane ke naam par pariksha chhod dete hai yaa fail ho jate hai
 How long will we run away from this question until all the youth of India are destroyed
 19 june kii press relies main bie bikom birsi ke chaatro kii sankhya di gai he or unke paas pratishat die gaye hai, magar paas pratishat ko sarkari anudaan praapt or swany vitt poshit sansthaanon main baat diya gaya he taaki ye na lage ki sarkari sansthaanon main padhai kaa str kharaab he
 23,358 students joined the BSC second year and 20 percent were successful
 kya 80 fisadi chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? biessi tritiy varsh main 34,091 chaatr shaamil hue or 19
 18 percent of students were successful
 kya 80 pratishat se adhik chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? bie first year main 77,259 chaatr shaamil hue or 59
 95 percent passed
 kya 40 pratishat chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? bie second year main 61,610 chaatr shaamil hue or 79
 86 percent passed
 kya 20 pratishat chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? biessi pratham varsh main 40,442 chaatr shaamil hue or 43
 01 percent passed
 kya 57 pratishat chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? This is the game
 fail hone vaale chaatro kaa pratishat sarkari or privet main baant diya gaya he
 If the result in private is so bad, then the university should tell what action it is going to take
 sarkari anudaan praapt collejon main paas pratishat bhale hi dekhne main 50 se 70 pratishat ke bich dikh rahaa he magar 20 se 40 pratishat chaatro kaa fail hona bhi uski clavity par sawaal he
 But one thing was not understood
 pariksha shuru hone se pehle 22 farvari ko vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati manoj dikshit ne press conference main kaha tha ki is baar snaatak str kii parikshaon main chah lakh 11 hazaar 680 chaatr shaamil honge
 But according to the calculation given in the press release of June 19, the number of students taking the exam is only 3 lakh 31 thousand 239
 hamen samaj nahin aayaa ki baaki ke 2 lakh 80 hazaar 441 chaatr kahaan gaye
 Has the calculation of courses like BBA and BCA been removed from it so that the total number of students who failed is reduced
 hamane uniwarsity series main dikhaaya tha ki avadh uniwarsity ke kai collejon main paryaapt sankhya main shikshak nahin hai
 Many colleges are only on paper, there is no education there
 yah sawaal maine apane liye nahin balki us garib ilaake ke saadhaaran pariwaron ke bacchon ke liye uthaaya tha ki aakhir unhen ghatiya quality kii shiksha kyon di ja rahi he
 Now the university has said that samples of 100 answer sheets will be sent to another university for examination so that it can be confirmed that there is no disturbance in the investigation
 iske liye fees nahin lagegi or chaatr chahen to is 100 copy main apni copy shaamil karaane kaa aavedan de sakate hai
 Isn't it strange? agar paanch sau chaatro ne aavedan kar diya to phir uniwarsity kya karegi
 Our question is another, how far is it appropriate to take Rs 3000 from students of a poor area to check the answer book
 yah vyavastha 6 maah pehle lagu hui yaa ab lagu hui isse matlab nahin he sawaal he ki 3000 rupee jaanch ke kyon liye jaaenge
 Mistake of university and money of student
 yahaan system yah he ki 300 rupee pehle dijie phir uttar pustika kii photo copy hasil kiijie
 If it seems that there is a disturbance then give 3000 thousand so that the investigation can be done
 kya hoshiyaari he paisa kamaane kii
 Not only Avadh University, this is happening in many other universities
 chaatr sawaal uthaate hai magar koi sunne vaala nahin he
 Not only Avadh University, you should look at the Hindi newspapers of the first week of June
 patrika, amar ujaalaa, jaagran, hindustan
 Only 20 percent students have passed in Bundelkhand University
 biessi pratham varsh main 88 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 The result of private colleges has been the worst
 sochie privet collejon kaa ye haal he
 Here, again, 3000 rupees have to be paid for a copy check
 nakal roak di gai acchhee baat he magar jo asaliyat saamne ai he wo usase bhi buree bhi baat he
 Why are the results of these colleges so bad? kanpur ke chhatrapati shahu ji maharaj vishvavidhyalay ke nattejey bhi bataa rahe hai ki nakal par roak ke saath saath padhai kii quality par dhyaan dene kii zarurat he
 This video is a few days old
 chaatr fail hone par naaraaz hai or uttar pustika kii dobaaraa jaanch kii maang kar rahe hai
 Registrar Sanjay Kumar told that 93 thousand students appeared in the examination in the first year of b
sc
 inamen se 49
 Only 9 children have passed
 38
 24 percent have failed and close to 11 percent have not appeared for the exam
 biessi part tu main 94620 main sirf 33 pratishat chaatr hi paas ho sake
 Close to 58 percent have failed
 biessi third year main 98 hazaar ke kareeb chaatr pariksha main baithe jisamen 57 percent hi paas hue
 39 percent failed
 kanpur dehaat ke ek college main 130 chaatro main se ek paas hua he
 This is the condition of studies
 chaatro kii maang par cameti bhi bani ki kahin moolyankan main gadabadi to nahin hui magar cameti ne uniwarsity ko clin chit diya he
 a total of 1 lakh 28 thousand students have failed in the three years of b
sc of Kanpur University
 kya yah gambhir masalaa nahin he? ab aap sochie ki kya padhai ho rahi he ki itane chaatr fail ho rahe hai
 What will these contribute to India's productivity or economy
 bharat ke vishvavidhyalayon main pachaas hazaar se ek lakh ke bich lekturer professor ke pad khaali hai
 The administration of the university is happy that it is not allowed to be copied, but is it not a cry that college students failed in college
 unhen kya padhaayaa gaya kya isaki javabdehi kisi kii nahin he
 Why our colleges are so poor that students are not able to pass
 yah sawaal vahaan vetan paa rahe professor lekturer or chaatro teenon se he
 Do students understand what they are doing with themselves? baat sirf kanpur or avadh uniwarsity kii nahin
 On June 4, a news of Pankaj Dabhol appeared in the Times of India
 94 fisadi iti graduate naukari dene ke laayak nahin hai
 This statement is from the CEO of Tech Mahindra
 iti companiyon ko ab apana training centre kholana padaa he
 Top IT companies employ only 6 percent of IT engineers
 ham yah baat kai saal se sun rahe hai ki hamaare ejeeniyar kisi laayak nahin hai
 Common families are paying twenty-two million fees in private colleges by paying loans and after passing it is heard that 94% of IT engineers are not fit to be hired, then with whom is this cheating? kya yah dakaiti nahin he
 Are parents and students not cheated? kya yah sharmnaak nahin he ki bharat kii ejineering kii shiksha itani ghatiya he ki iske collejon se paas 94 fisadi ejeeniyar naukari par rakhe jane laayak nahin hai
 Are the youth not being deceived? kya usne muft main padhai kii thi
 It is better to change your questions or else the situation will not change
 aapako pataa he ki elahabaad main upi lok seva ayog ke baahar chaatro ne pradarshan kiya tha
 They demanded that the question papers of the second innings in the first innings of Hindi have been divided, so the examination should be canceled
 ayog ne pariksha radd bhi kar di magar sirf hindi kii
 Students started demanding that the entire exam be canceled, but the commission said that there was such a mess at the same center, so why cancel the rest of the exam
 is baat ko lekar chaatr ugr hue, police ne lathi charge kii, aath chaatro ko giraftaar kar liya
 Now seven of these students have been released so that they can appear for the examination on 21 June
 magar isamen shaamil samaajawaadee party kii netaa or elahabaad uniwarsity kii purv adhyaksh richa singh ko nahin choda gaya he
 He has been sent to jail
 tippaniyan The tenth result was to come on 20 June in Bihar
 17 lakh se adhik chaatr intazaar kar rahe the magar riselt ab 26 june ko aayega,kyonki aapako bataaya tha ki gopalganj zile main 42 hazaar uttar pustikaayen chori ho gai hai
 The same situation is with the farmers
 uttar pradesh ke amroha main kisaanon ne koi das hazaar bighas main tamaato ugaaya he
 In UP, most tomatoes are in Amroha itself, though mangoes are also very good
 yahaan ke kisaanon ne sadak ke kinare tomaamar phenk diya,kyonki bechney par bhi laagat nahin mil rahaa tha
 There is a crate of 30 kg
 kuch din pehle yahaan kii mandi main 80-90 rupee cret mil rahaa tha yani ek kilo ke 2 se 3 rupee mil rahe the, jabaki ek kilo tamaato ugane main 15 rupee kii laagat aati he
 We are also surprised by the change in the rate after this report from Amroha to Anwar Kamal
 haftaa bhar pehle 80 rupaya cret bhav tha, ab 280 se 290 rupee cret milane laga he
 That is, the price of Rs 8 to 9 kg is being available
 yah bhi kam he magar ek report ke baad 3 rupee se bhav 9 rupee kaise ho gaya he, ham bhi nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 Farmers were saying that last year Pakistan got a lot of price due to export, so this time it took up more land on rent and did farming
 amroha zile main das hazaar bighas main tamaato kii kheti ho gai
 Many farmers are in debt due to loss
 amroha dilli se bahut dur nahin he
 There the farmer is not getting even 10 rupees for a kilo of tomatoes, but today the price of tomatoes was Rs 50 per kg at Katwaria Sarai in South Delhi
 safal main 44 rupaya kilo bhav he
 Now you tell me, in Amroha, the farmer is not getting 3 rupees per kg, while he is investing 15 rupees for growing one kilogram of tomatoes and 50 rupees tomatoes are being sold in Delhi
 aap bhi lut rahe hai or kisaan bhi lut rahaa he
 Then who is it that is carrying a profit of 47 rupees
 in sawaalon kaa thos samaadhaan koi pesh nahin kar rahaa he
 Politics has turned into gossip
 tay aapako karnaa he ki gapp hi sunanaa he yaa kaam bhi dekhnaa he
 See these young men scattered at the railway station
 inaki gahari neend se kisi netaa ko dar janaa chahie ki jaagane ke baad kya karenge
 But these youths have given confidence to the leaders that they are carrying dead bodies
 unhen bas bhartee pariksha kaa elaan suna diya jaae phir uske baad teen-teen saal riselt ke intjaar main hi guzaar denge
 These young men are sleeping at Allahabad station on the night of 18 June, because the next morning the soldier has to be tested
 in naujavaanon ke paas aaj ke bhaatar main bhi elahabaad shahar main thaharne kii haisiyat nahin he
 One of these youngsters who spend the night on the platform is awake

 Will he keep saying this for the next several years or will he find a solution at some point or the other
 jab hamane prime time ke darshak se kaha ki ek video bhi bhejie to unhone ye bheja he
 We showed these pictures so that you can get an idea of the India which is sleeping on the pavements in search of a unique job every day
 taaki hamaare netaa is samasya ke bare main aapke bich aakar bolen
 a news report from Rajasthan Patrika was seeing that about four lakh applications have been received for the 180 posts of Supervisor in the Department of Women and Child Development
 ek seat par 2214 daavedaar hai
 There is so much competition
 naukari he nahin
 The situation is that within the year, it has become a challenge to get the examinations and give appointment letters
 balki bahaanaa bhi
 Now, no one knows when the railway examination will take place
 dhai karod aavedan ek lakh padon ke liye aae hai
 Look at a picture taken by our colleague Amitesh
 aadmi kab insaan ho jaataa he, kab saamaan ho jaataa he, yah is par nirbhar karata he ki uski jeb main kitne rupee hai
 These young soldiers will protect us as soldiers, but before that they can see what inhuman process they are going through
 malgadee ke pichley dibbe par ladaaye fadaaye chale ja rahe hai
 Remember the scene of this freight train going towards Mughalsarai
 acchhee baat he ki in naujavaanon kii raajnneetik chetana shunya he varanaa hamaare netaaon ko tharthari ho jaati
 The young corpses of India are peace-filled youth who should be seen just advertising a job
 khandhar main badal chuke college nahin dikhte hai, college ke bheetar ghatiya teacher nahin dikhte hai
 We see nothing from you
 hamane ram manohar lohia avadh uniwarsity ke bie biessi, bi com or post graduate ke riselt ke bare main bataaya tha
 There is a procession of those who failed there
 vishvavidhyalay ne is saal pariksha ke dauraan nakal rokane ke liye camere laga die
 The copying has stopped, but the number of people who fail and leave the examination is telling that this university is of no use
 yahaan padhane vaale or naam likhaa kar nahin padhane vaale chaatro ko pataa he ki kahaan professor aate hai, kahaan padhaate hai or kahaan sirf naam likhaaya jaataa he, pariksha paas karaayaa jaataa he or padhai nahin hoti he
 It is not just about Avadh University, we have Jaypee University of Chapra and Dr
 of Muzaffarpur in prime time
 ambedkar bihar uniwarsity kaa bhi haal bataaya tha
 We had told in prime time that around six lakh students appeared in the examination at Awadh University and eighty percent of them failed
 yani 4 lakh 80 hazaar ke kareeb fail ho gaye
 The university released a press release on June 19, presenting the data in such a way that everything looks good
 is relies main likhaa he ki pariksha par prashn chinh lagaaya ja rahaa he
 We had put a question mark on the education here, what is the quality of studies that the number of people who fail to reach copying reaches millions
 kul milakar aankadon kii bazigaari kii gai he
 The difference between the percentage of government-funded colleges and the percentage of self-run colleges has been reported
 hamane overol jodakar bataaya tha ki 2017-18 main bie biessi, bi com ke teenon saal ke or post graduate str ke sava chah lakh chaatro ne pariksha di thi
 If 80 percent failed, then about 4 lakh 80,000 students failed due to this
 biessi third year ke 80 pratishat se adhik chaatr fail hai
 In BSC first year, 56 percent students have failed
 sultanpur ke ganpat sahay post graduate mahavidhyalay ke ganit main final year main kareeb 300 chaatr the lekin inamen se maatr 20-25 chaatr paas hue hai
 Nearly 275 have failed
 19 june ko vaais chancelar ne ek meeting kar aankadon ko is tarah pesh kiya he jisase na lage ki chaar lakh bachche fail ho gaye
 Our emphasis is on why the quality of studies is so poor that students leave or fail in the name of stopping copying
 ham kab tak bhaagenge is sawaal se kya tab tak jab tak bharat ke saare noujvaan barbaad nahin kar die jate
 The June 19 press release lists the number of BA bcom BAC students and their percentages, but the pass percentage has been distributed among government-funded and self-funded institutions so that it does not look as if studying in government institutions Level is poor
 biessi dwitiya varsh main 23,358 chaatr shaamil hue or 20 pratishat safal hue
 Is it not shameful that 80 percent of the students fail? In BSC III year, 34,091 students attended and 19
 18 pratishat chaatr safal hue
 Is it not shameful that more than 80 percent of the students fail? 77,259 students attended and 59 in BA First Year
 95 pratishat paas hue
 Is it not shameful that 40 percent of the students fail? 61,610 students attended the BA Second Year and 79
 86 pratishat paas hue
 Isn't it embarrassing for 20 percent of the students to fail? 40,442 students attended and 43 in bsc first year
 01 pratishat paas hue
 Isn't it embarrassing for 57 percent of the students to fail? yahi khel he
 The percentage of students who failed is divided into government and private
 agar privet main rigelt itnaa kharaab he to vishvavidhyalay yah bataae ki vah kya ection lene ja rahaa he
 The pass percentage in government-funded colleges may be between 50 and 70 percent in sight, but the failure of 20 to 40 percent students is also a question on its quality
 par ek baat samaj nahin ai
 On February 22, before the examination started, the Vice Chancellor of the University, Manoj Dixit, said in a press conference that this time six lakh 11 thousand 680 students will be included in the graduation examinations
 magar 19 june kii press release main jo hisaab diya he uske anusaar to pariksha dene vaale chaatro kii sankhya 3 lakh 31 hazaar 239 hi he
 We did not understand where the remaining 2 lakh 80 thousand 441 students went
 kya bibie or bisie jaise course kaa hisaab isamen se hataa diya gaya he taaki fail hone vaale chaatro kii total sankhya kam lage
 We had shown in the University Series that many colleges in Awadh University do not have sufficient number of teachers
 kai collejon main sirf kaagaj par hi hai vahaan padhai nahin hoti
 i raised this question not for myself but for the children of ordinary families of that poor area, why are they being given poor quality education
 ab uniwarsity ne kaha he ki 100 uttar pustikaon ke sample duusari uniwarsity main jaanch ke liye bheje jaaenge taaki isaki pushti ho sake ki jaanch main gadabadi to nahin hui he
 There will be no fee for this and students can apply to include their copy in this 100 copy if they wish
 kya yah ajeeb nahi he
 If five hundred students apply then what will the university do
 hamaara sawaal ek or he ek garib ilaake ke chaatro se uttar pustika kii jaanch ke liye 3000 rupee lenaa kahaan tak uchit he
 This system came into force 6 months ago or is implemented now
 It does not mean that the question of why 3000 rupees will be taken for investigation
 galati uniwarsity kii or paisa chaatr kaa
 The system here is to give Rs 300 first and then get a photo copy of the answer book
 usamen lagata he ki gadabadi hui he to phir 3000 hazaar dijie taaki jaanch ho
 What is the intelligence to earn money
 avadh uniwarsity hi nahin duusari kai uniwarsity main yah sab hone laga he
 Students raise questions but no one is listening
 avadh uniwarsity hi nahin aap june ke pehle saptaah ke hindi ke akhabaaron ko dekhie
 Magazine, Amar Ujala, Jagran, Hindustan
 bundelkhand vishvavidhyalay main 20 pratishat chaatr hi paas hue hai
 In BSC first year 88 percent students have failed
 privet collejon kaa riselt sabase kharaab rahaa he
 Think this is the condition of private colleges
 yahaan bhi dobaaraa copy check karaane ke liye 3000 rupee dene padate hai
 Copying has been stopped is a good thing, but the reality that has come out is worse than that
 in collejon kaa rigelt itnaa kharaab kyon hai
 The results of Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University of Kanpur are also showing that apart from stopping the copying, there is a need to pay attention to the quality of studies
 yah video kuch din purana he
 The students are angry at the failure and are demanding a re-examination of the answer sheet
 register sanjay kumaar ne bataaya biessi pratham varsh main 93 hazaar chaatr pariksha main shaamil hue the
 49 of these
 9 bachche hi paas hue hai
 38
 24 pratishat fail hue hai or 11 pratishat ke kareeb pariksha main baithe hi nahin
 In BSC Part Two, only 33 percent of the students could pass in 94620
 58 pratishat ke kareeb fail hue hai
 In BSC Third Year, close to 98 thousand students appeared in the examination, in which only 57% passed
 39 percent fail ho gaye
 One in 130 students passed out in a college in Kanpur Dehat
 ye haal he padhai kaa
 a committee was also formed on the demand of students that there was no disturbance in the assessment, but the committee has given a clean chit to the university
 kanpur uniwarsity ke biessi ke teenon saal main kul 1 lakh 28 hazaar chaatr fail hue hai
 Isn't this a serious issue? Now think what is going on in studies that so many students are failing
 ye bharat kii utpaadakta yaa arthvyavastha main kya yogadan karenge
 Between fifty thousand and one lakh lecturers professor positions are vacant in universities in India
 uniwarsity kaa prashasan khush he ki nakal nahin hone di lekin kya yah rone vaali baat nahin he ki college ke college chaatr fail ho gaye
 No one is accountable for what they have been taught
 kyon hamaare collejon kii padhai itani kharaab he ki chaatr paas hone laayak nahin hai
 This question is from the three lecturers and students who are getting salaries
 kya chaatr samaj rahe hai ki ve apane saath kya kar rahe hai
 It is not just about Kanpur and Awadh University
 isi 4 june ko times of india main pankaj dabhol kii ek khabar chhapi he
 94 percent of IT graduates are not eligible for employment
 yah bayaan tech mahindra ke siio kaa he
 IT companies now have to open their own training centers
 chotii kii iti companiyaan maatr 6 pratishat iti ejeeniyar ko naukari par rakhti hai
 We have been hearing for many years that our engineers are not fit
 aam parivaar karz lekar bees-bees lakh fees dekar privet collejon main padhaa rahe hai or paas hone ke baad yah sunne ko mili ki 94 fisadi iti ejeeniyar naukari par rakhe jane laayak nahin hai to yah kiske saath dhokhaa he
 Isn't it a robbery? kya maa baap or chaatr ke saath dhokhaa nahin hai
 Isn't it shameful that India's engineering education is so inferior that 94 per cent of engineers from its colleges are not fit to be hired? kya naujavaanon ke saath dhokhaa nahin ho rahaa he
 Did she study for free? behatar he apane sawaal badal len varanaa halaat nahin badalenge
 You know that students demonstrated outside the UP Public Service Commission in Allahabad
 inaki maang thi ki hindi kii pehali pari main duusari pari ke prashn patr bant gaye hai, isliye pariksha radd ho
 The Commission also canceled the examination but did only Hindi
 chaatr maang karne lage ki sari pariksha radd ho magar ayog kaa kahana tha ki ek hi centre par aisi gadabadi hui he, isliye baaki pariksha kyon radd karen
 Students were agitated about this, police charged lathi, arrested eight students
 ab inamen se saat chaatro ko chhod diya gaya he taaki ve 21 june kii pariksha main shaamil ho saken
 But the Samajwadi Party leader and former Allahabad University president Richa Singh has not been left out
 unhen jail bhej diya gaya he
 The comments bihar main 20 june ko dasvin kaa riselt aana tha
 More than 17 lakh students were waiting, but the result will now come on 26 June, because you were told that 42 thousand answer sheets have been stolen in Gopalganj district
 yahi haal kisaanon kaa he
 In Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, farmers have grown tomatoes in ten thousand bighas
 upi main sabase adhik tamaato amroha main hi hota he vaise aam bhi khub hota he
 The farmers here threw the tamaras on the side of the road, because the cost was not available even if they were sold
 30 kilo kaa ek cret hota he
 a few days ago, there was a crate of 80-90 rupees in the mandi here, that is, 2 to 3 rupees per kg, while it costs Rs 15 to grow one kg of tomatoes
 amroha se anwar kamaal kii is report ke baad jo rate main badlaav aayaa he usase ham bhi hairaan he
 a week ago, there was a crate price of 80 rupees, now 280 to 290 crates are available
 yani 8 rupee se 9 rupee kilo ke bhav mil rahe hai
 This is also less, but after a report, how the price has gone from 3 rupees to 9 rupees, we are unable to understand
 kisaan kah rahe the ki pichley saal pakistan niryaat ke kaaran khub bhav mila to is baar zyaada zamin kiraaye par lekar kheti kar lee
 In Amroha district, tomato cultivated in ten thousand bighas
 kai kisaan nuksaan ke kaaran karze main aa gaye hai
 Amroha is not far from Delhi
 vahaan kisaan ko ek kilo tamaato ke 10 rupee bhi nahin mil rahe hai lekin aaj hi dakshin dilli ke katwaria sarai main tamaato kaa bhav 50 rupee kilo tha
 There is a price of 44 rupees kg in the successful
 ab aap hi bataaiye amroha main kisaan ko 3 rupee kilo bhav nahin mil rahe hai, jabaki vah ek kilo tomaamar ugane main 15 rupee laga de rahaa he or dilli main 50 rupee kilo tamaato bik rahaa he
 You are also being plundered and the farmer is also being plundered
 phir yah koun he jo 47 rupee kaa munafa le ja rahaa he
 No one is offering concrete solutions to these questions
 raajnneeti gappabaazi main badal gai he
 You have to decide whether to listen to the chat or see the work
 hamaare netaa lagaataar aise naujavaanon kii ratjaagi kaa mazaaq uda rahe hai
 This girl is sleeping here, so that she will be in a position to wake up in the morning and solve the questions
 aap jaanate hai ki upi police bhartee board ne 18 or 19 june ko 40 hazaar se adhik sipaahiyon ke liye 860 kendron par pariksha yojit kii thi
 For which 22 lakh candidates had filled the forms

 Wearing a national costume vest on the pavement and platform, the youngster has slept outside the station

 Who is proud of the dignity of unemployed youth
 aap kahenge ki ye to kai saal se yahi hota he
 Will he keep saying this for the next several years or will he find a solution at some point or the other
 jab hamane prime time ke darshak se kaha ki ek video bhi bhejie to unhone ye bheja he
 We showed these pictures so that you can get an idea of the India which is sleeping on the pavements in search of a unique job every day
 taaki hamaare netaa is samasya ke bare main aapke bich aakar bolen
 a news report from Rajasthan Patrika was seeing that about four lakh applications have been received for the 180 posts of Supervisor in the Department of Women and Child Development
 ek seat par 2214 daavedaar hai
 There is so much competition
 naukari he nahin
 The situation is that within the year, it has become a challenge to get the examinations and give appointment letters
 balki bahaanaa bhi
 Now, no one knows when the railway examination will take place
 dhai karod aavedan ek lakh padon ke liye aae hai
 Look at a picture taken by our colleague Amitesh
 aadmi kab insaan ho jaataa he, kab saamaan ho jaataa he, yah is par nirbhar karata he ki uski jeb main kitne rupee hai
 These young soldiers will protect us as soldiers, but before that they can see what inhuman process they are going through
 malgadee ke pichley dibbe par ladaaye fadaaye chale ja rahe hai
 Remember the scene of this freight train going towards Mughalsarai
 acchhee baat he ki in naujavaanon kii raajnneetik chetana shunya he varanaa hamaare netaaon ko tharthari ho jaati
 The young corpses of India are peace-filled youth who should be seen just advertising a job
 khandhar main badal chuke college nahin dikhte hai, college ke bheetar ghatiya teacher nahin dikhte hai
 We see nothing from you
 hamane ram manohar lohia avadh uniwarsity ke bie biessi, bi com or post graduate ke riselt ke bare main bataaya tha
 There is a procession of those who failed there
 vishvavidhyalay ne is saal pariksha ke dauraan nakal rokane ke liye camere laga die
 The copying has stopped, but the number of people who fail and leave the examination is telling that this university is of no use
 yahaan padhane vaale or naam likhaa kar nahin padhane vaale chaatro ko pataa he ki kahaan professor aate hai, kahaan padhaate hai or kahaan sirf naam likhaaya jaataa he, pariksha paas karaayaa jaataa he or padhai nahin hoti he
 It is not just about Avadh University, we have Jaypee University of Chapra and Dr
 of Muzaffarpur in prime time
 ambedkar bihar uniwarsity kaa bhi haal bataaya tha
 We had told in prime time that around six lakh students appeared in the examination at Awadh University and eighty percent of them failed
 yani 4 lakh 80 hazaar ke kareeb fail ho gaye
 The university released a press release on June 19, presenting the data in such a way that everything looks good
 is relies main likhaa he ki pariksha par prashn chinh lagaaya ja rahaa he
 We had put a question mark on the education here, what is the quality of studies that the number of people who fail to reach copying reaches millions
 kul milakar aankadon kii bazigaari kii gai he
 The difference between the percentage of government-funded colleges and the percentage of self-run colleges has been reported
 hamane overol jodakar bataaya tha ki 2017-18 main bie biessi, bi com ke teenon saal ke or post graduate str ke sava chah lakh chaatro ne pariksha di thi
 If 80 percent failed, then about 4 lakh 80,000 students failed due to this
 biessi third year ke 80 pratishat se adhik chaatr fail hai
 In BSC first year, 56 percent students have failed
 sultanpur ke ganpat sahay post graduate mahavidhyalay ke ganit main final year main kareeb 300 chaatr the lekin inamen se maatr 20-25 chaatr paas hue hai
 Nearly 275 have failed
 19 june ko vaais chancelar ne ek meeting kar aankadon ko is tarah pesh kiya he jisase na lage ki chaar lakh bachche fail ho gaye
 Our emphasis is on why the quality of studies is so poor that students leave or fail in the name of stopping copying
 ham kab tak bhaagenge is sawaal se kya tab tak jab tak bharat ke saare noujvaan barbaad nahin kar die jate
 The June 19 press release lists the number of BA bcom BAC students and their percentages, but the pass percentage has been distributed among government-funded and self-funded institutions so that it does not look as if studying in government institutions Level is poor
 biessi dwitiya varsh main 23,358 chaatr shaamil hue or 20 pratishat safal hue
 Is it not shameful that 80 percent of the students fail? In BSC III year, 34,091 students attended and 19
 18 pratishat chaatr safal hue
 Is it not shameful that more than 80 percent of the students fail? 77,259 students attended and 59 in BA First Year
 95 pratishat paas hue
 Is it not shameful that 40 percent of the students fail? 61,610 students attended the BA Second Year and 79
 86 pratishat paas hue
 Isn't it embarrassing for 20 percent of the students to fail? 40,442 students attended and 43 in bsc first year
 01 pratishat paas hue
 Isn't it embarrassing for 57 percent of the students to fail? yahi khel he
 The percentage of students who failed is divided into government and private
 agar privet main rigelt itnaa kharaab he to vishvavidhyalay yah bataae ki vah kya ection lene ja rahaa he
 The pass percentage in government-funded colleges may be between 50 and 70 percent in sight, but the failure of 20 to 40 percent students is also a question on its quality
 par ek baat samaj nahin ai
 On February 22, before the examination started, the Vice Chancellor of the University, Manoj Dixit, said in a press conference that this time six lakh 11 thousand 680 students will be included in the graduation examinations
 magar 19 june kii press release main jo hisaab diya he uske anusaar to pariksha dene vaale chaatro kii sankhya 3 lakh 31 hazaar 239 hi he
 We did not understand where the remaining 2 lakh 80 thousand 441 students went
 kya bibie or bisie jaise course kaa hisaab isamen se hataa diya gaya he taaki fail hone vaale chaatro kii total sankhya kam lage
 We had shown in the University Series that many colleges in Awadh University do not have sufficient number of teachers
 kai collejon main sirf kaagaj par hi hai vahaan padhai nahin hoti
 i raised this question not for myself but for the children of ordinary families of that poor area, why are they being given poor quality education
 ab uniwarsity ne kaha he ki 100 uttar pustikaon ke sample duusari uniwarsity main jaanch ke liye bheje jaaenge taaki isaki pushti ho sake ki jaanch main gadabadi to nahin hui he
 There will be no fee for this and students can apply to include their copy in this 100 copy if they wish
 kya yah ajeeb nahi he
 If five hundred students apply then what will the university do
 hamaara sawaal ek or he ek garib ilaake ke chaatro se uttar pustika kii jaanch ke liye 3000 rupee lenaa kahaan tak uchit he
 This system came into force 6 months ago or is implemented now
 It does not mean that the question of why 3000 rupees will be taken for investigation
 galati uniwarsity kii or paisa chaatr kaa
 The system here is to give Rs 300 first and then get a photo copy of the answer book
 usamen lagata he ki gadabadi hui he to phir 3000 hazaar dijie taaki jaanch ho
 What is the intelligence to earn money
 avadh uniwarsity hi nahin duusari kai uniwarsity main yah sab hone laga he
 Students raise questions but no one is listening
 avadh uniwarsity hi nahin aap june ke pehle saptaah ke hindi ke akhabaaron ko dekhie
 Magazine, Amar Ujala, Jagran, Hindustan
 bundelkhand vishvavidhyalay main 20 pratishat chaatr hi paas hue hai
 In BSC first year 88 percent students have failed
 privet collejon kaa riselt sabase kharaab rahaa he
 Think this is the condition of private colleges
 yahaan bhi dobaaraa copy check karaane ke liye 3000 rupee dene padate hai
 Copying has been stopped is a good thing, but the reality that has come out is worse than that
 in collejon kaa rigelt itnaa kharaab kyon hai
 The results of Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University of Kanpur are also showing that apart from stopping the copying, there is a need to pay attention to the quality of studies
 yah video kuch din purana he
 The students are angry at the failure and are demanding a re-examination of the answer sheet
 register sanjay kumaar ne bataaya biessi pratham varsh main 93 hazaar chaatr pariksha main shaamil hue the
 49 of these
 9 bachche hi paas hue hai
 38
 24 pratishat fail hue hai or 11 pratishat ke kareeb pariksha main baithe hi nahin
 In BSC Part Two, only 33 percent of the students could pass in 94620
 58 pratishat ke kareeb fail hue hai
 In BSC Third Year, close to 98 thousand students appeared in the examination, in which only 57% passed
 39 percent fail ho gaye
 One in 130 students passed out in a college in Kanpur Dehat
 ye haal he padhai kaa
 a committee was also formed on the demand of students that there was no disturbance in the assessment, but the committee has given a clean chit to the university
 kanpur uniwarsity ke biessi ke teenon saal main kul 1 lakh 28 hazaar chaatr fail hue hai
 Isn't this a serious issue? Now think what is going on in studies that so many students are failing
 ye bharat kii utpaadakta yaa arthvyavastha main kya yogadan karenge
 Between fifty thousand and one lakh lecturers professor positions are vacant in universities in India
 uniwarsity kaa prashasan khush he ki nakal nahin hone di lekin kya yah rone vaali baat nahin he ki college ke college chaatr fail ho gaye
 No one is accountable for what they have been taught
 kyon hamaare collejon kii padhai itani kharaab he ki chaatr paas hone laayak nahin hai
 This question is from the three lecturers and students who are getting salaries
 kya chaatr samaj rahe hai ki ve apane saath kya kar rahe hai
 It is not just about Kanpur and Awadh University
 isi 4 june ko times of india main pankaj dabhol kii ek khabar chhapi he
 94 percent of IT graduates are not eligible for employment
 yah bayaan tech mahindra ke siio kaa he
 IT companies now have to open their own training centers
 chotii kii iti companiyaan maatr 6 pratishat iti ejeeniyar ko naukari par rakhti hai
 We have been hearing for many years that our engineers are not fit
 aam parivaar karz lekar bees-bees lakh fees dekar privet collejon main padhaa rahe hai or paas hone ke baad yah sunne ko mili ki 94 fisadi iti ejeeniyar naukari par rakhe jane laayak nahin hai to yah kiske saath dhokhaa he
 Isn't it a robbery? kya maa baap or chaatr ke saath dhokhaa nahin hai
 Isn't it shameful that India's engineering education is so inferior that 94 per cent of engineers from its colleges are not fit to be hired? kya naujavaanon ke saath dhokhaa nahin ho rahaa he
 Did she study for free? behatar he apane sawaal badal len varanaa halaat nahin badalenge
 You know that students demonstrated outside the UP Public Service Commission in Allahabad
 inaki maang thi ki hindi kii pehali pari main duusari pari ke prashn patr bant gaye hai, isliye pariksha radd ho
 The Commission also canceled the examination but did only Hindi
 chaatr maang karne lage ki sari pariksha radd ho magar ayog kaa kahana tha ki ek hi centre par aisi gadabadi hui he, isliye baaki pariksha kyon radd karen
 Students were agitated about this, police charged lathi, arrested eight students
 ab inamen se saat chaatro ko chhod diya gaya he taaki ve 21 june kii pariksha main shaamil ho saken
 But the Samajwadi Party leader and former Allahabad University president Richa Singh has not been left out
 unhen jail bhej diya gaya he
 The comments bihar main 20 june ko dasvin kaa riselt aana tha
 More than 17 lakh students were waiting, but the result will now come on 26 June, because you were told that 42 thousand answer sheets have been stolen in Gopalganj district
 yahi haal kisaanon kaa he
 In Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, farmers have grown tomatoes in ten thousand bighas
 upi main sabase adhik tamaato amroha main hi hota he vaise aam bhi khub hota he
 The farmers here threw the tamaras on the side of the road, because the cost was not available even if they were sold
 30 kilo kaa ek cret hota he
 a few days ago, there was a crate of 80-90 rupees in the mandi here, that is, 2 to 3 rupees per kg, while it costs Rs 15 to grow one kg of tomatoes
 amroha se anwar kamaal kii is report ke baad jo rate main badlaav aayaa he usase ham bhi hairaan he
 a week ago, there was a crate price of 80 rupees, now 280 to 290 crates are available
 yani 8 rupee se 9 rupee kilo ke bhav mil rahe hai
 This is also less, but after a report, how the price has gone from 3 rupees to 9 rupees, we are unable to understand
 kisaan kah rahe the ki pichley saal pakistan niryaat ke kaaran khub bhav mila to is baar zyaada zamin kiraaye par lekar kheti kar lee
 In Amroha district, tomato cultivated in ten thousand bighas
 kai kisaan nuksaan ke kaaran karze main aa gaye hai
 Amroha is not far from Delhi
 vahaan kisaan ko ek kilo tamaato ke 10 rupee bhi nahin mil rahe hai lekin aaj hi dakshin dilli ke katwaria sarai main tamaato kaa bhav 50 rupee kilo tha
 There is a price of 44 rupees kg in the successful
 ab aap hi bataaiye amroha main kisaan ko 3 rupee kilo bhav nahin mil rahe hai, jabaki vah ek kilo tomaamar ugane main 15 rupee laga de rahaa he or dilli main 50 rupee kilo tamaato bik rahaa he
 You are also being plundered and the farmer is also being plundered
 phir yah koun he jo 47 rupee kaa munafa le ja rahaa he
 No one is offering concrete solutions to these questions
 raajnneeti gappabaazi main badal gai he
 You have to decide whether to listen to the chat or see the work
 prime time ke ek darshak ne vibhuti express ke asi coach kaa haal bheja he
 In B-1 coach, this young man is going to Patna sitting in a sack like a potato
 berojgaar naujavaanon kii garima kii kise paravhaan he
 You would say that this has been the case for many years
 kya yah agle kai saal tak yahi kehete rahenge yaa phir iskaa samaadhaan kabhi na kabhi khojenge
 When we asked the prime time viewer to send a video too, he sent it
 hamane ye tasviren isliye dikhain taaki aapako us bharat kaa andaaza ho jo rose ek adad naukari kii talash main footpaathon par so rahaa he
 So that our leaders will come and talk about this problem among you
 rajasthan patrika kii ek khabar dekh rahaa tha ki mahila va bal vikaas vibhaag main suparviser ke 180 padon ke liye kareeb chaar lakh aavedan aa chuke hai
 There are 2214 contenders for one seat
 itnaa taff compatishan he
 Job is not there
 haalat yah he ki saal bhar ke bheetar parikshaon ko karakar niyukti patr de dena chunauti ban gai he
 But also an excuse
 ab dekhie railway kii pariksha kab hogi kisi ko pataa nahin
 2
5 crore applications have come for one lakh posts
 philhal ek tasviir dekhie jise hamaare sahyogi amitesh ne lee he
 When a man becomes a human being, when he becomes a luggage, it depends on how much money he has in his pocket
 yahi jawan sipaahi banakar hamaari raksha karenge magar uske pehle ye kis amanviya prakriya se guzar rahe hai aap dekh sakate hai
 Ladday fadaye are going to the last compartment of the goods train
 mughalsarai kii taraf ja rahi is malgadee ke drishy ko yaad rakhiegaa
 It is good that the political consciousness of these youth is zero or our leaders would have trembled
 bharat ke yuva murda shanti se bhare noujvaan hai jinhen bas ek naukari kaa vigyaapan dikh janaa chahie
 Colleges that have been transformed into ruins are not visible, there are no inferior teachers within the college
 hamen or aapako bhi kuch nahin dikhataa he
 We had told about the results of BA bsc, b Com and Post Graduate of Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University
 vahaan fail hone waalon kii baraat nikali he
 The university installed cameras to prevent cheating during the exam this year
 nakal to ruuk gai magar fail hone vaale or imtahaan chhodane waalon kii sankhya bataa rahi he ki ye uniwarsity kisi kaam kii nahin he
 Students who study here and do not write names know where professors come, where they teach and where only names are written, exams are passed and no studies are done
 sirf avadh uniwarsity kii baat nahin he, hamane prime time main chhapra ke jepi uniwarsity or muzaffarpur ke dow
 Ambedkar had also told the condition of Bihar University
 hamane prime time main bataaya tha ki avadh uniwarsity main chah lakh ke kareeb chaatr pariksha main shaamil hue the or inamen se assi fisadi chaatr fail ho gaye
 That means around 4 lakh 80 thousand have failed
 uniwarsity ne 19 june ko ek press relies jari kar aankadon ko aise pesh kiya he ki sab kuch acha acha dikhe
 It is written in this release that a question mark is being put on the exam
 hamane yahaan kii padhai par prashn chinh lagaaya tha ki padhai kii kya quality he ki nakal rokane par fail hone vaale kii sankhya lakhon main pahunch jaati he
 Overall, the data is marketed
 sarkaar dwaara anudaan praapt collejon ke paas pratishat or khud se chalane vaale collejon ke paas pratishat main antar bataaya gaya he
 We had added that overall, in 2017-18, BA and b
sc, b
com three-year and post-graduate level six and a half million students took the exam
 80 pratishat fail ho gaye to is hisaab se fail hone vaale chaatro kii sankhya kareeb 4 lakh 80,000 ke kareeb chaatr fail hai
 Over 80 percent of BSC third year students fail
 biessi pratham varsh main 56 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 Ganapat Sahay Post Graduate College of Sultanpur had about 300 students in the final year in mathematics but only 20-25 of these have passed
 275 ke kareeb fail ho gaye hai
 On 19 June, the Vice Chancellor held a meeting and presented the data in such a way that four lakh children failed
 hamaara jor is par he ki padhai kii quality itani ghatiya kyon he ki chaatr nakal rokane ke naam par pariksha chhod dete hai yaa fail ho jate hai
 How long will we run away from this question until all the youth of India are destroyed
 19 june kii press relies main bie bikom birsi ke chaatro kii sankhya di gai he or unke paas pratishat die gaye hai, magar paas pratishat ko sarkari anudaan praapt or swany vitt poshit sansthaanon main baat diya gaya he taaki ye na lage ki sarkari sansthaanon main padhai kaa str kharaab he
 23,358 students joined the BSC second year and 20 percent were successful
 kya 80 fisadi chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? biessi tritiy varsh main 34,091 chaatr shaamil hue or 19
 18 percent of students were successful
 kya 80 pratishat se adhik chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? bie first year main 77,259 chaatr shaamil hue or 59
 95 percent passed
 kya 40 pratishat chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? bie second year main 61,610 chaatr shaamil hue or 79
 86 percent passed
 kya 20 pratishat chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? biessi pratham varsh main 40,442 chaatr shaamil hue or 43
 01 percent passed
 kya 57 pratishat chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? This is the game
 fail hone vaale chaatro kaa pratishat sarkari or privet main baant diya gaya he
 If the result in private is so bad, then the university should tell what action it is going to take
 sarkari anudaan praapt collejon main paas pratishat bhale hi dekhne main 50 se 70 pratishat ke bich dikh rahaa he magar 20 se 40 pratishat chaatro kaa fail hona bhi uski clavity par sawaal he
 But one thing was not understood
 pariksha shuru hone se pehle 22 farvari ko vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati manoj dikshit ne press conference main kaha tha ki is baar snaatak str kii parikshaon main chah lakh 11 hazaar 680 chaatr shaamil honge
 But according to the calculation given in the press release of June 19, the number of students taking the exam is only 3 lakh 31 thousand 239
 hamen samaj nahin aayaa ki baaki ke 2 lakh 80 hazaar 441 chaatr kahaan gaye
 Has the calculation of courses like BBA and BCA been removed from it so that the total number of students who failed is reduced
 hamane uniwarsity series main dikhaaya tha ki avadh uniwarsity ke kai collejon main paryaapt sankhya main shikshak nahin hai
 Many colleges are only on paper, there is no education there
 yah sawaal maine apane liye nahin balki us garib ilaake ke saadhaaran pariwaron ke bacchon ke liye uthaaya tha ki aakhir unhen ghatiya quality kii shiksha kyon di ja rahi he
 Now the university has said that samples of 100 answer sheets will be sent to another university for examination so that it can be confirmed that there is no disturbance in the investigation
 iske liye fees nahin lagegi or chaatr chahen to is 100 copy main apni copy shaamil karaane kaa aavedan de sakate hai
 Isn't it strange? agar paanch sau chaatro ne aavedan kar diya to phir uniwarsity kya karegi
 Our question is another, how far is it appropriate to take Rs 3000 from students of a poor area to check the answer book
 yah vyavastha 6 maah pehle lagu hui yaa ab lagu hui isse matlab nahin he sawaal he ki 3000 rupee jaanch ke kyon liye jaaenge
 Mistake of university and money of student
 yahaan system yah he ki 300 rupee pehle dijie phir uttar pustika kii photo copy hasil kiijie
 If it seems that there is a disturbance then give 3000 thousand so that the investigation can be done
 kya hoshiyaari he paisa kamaane kii
 Not only Avadh University, this is happening in many other universities
 chaatr sawaal uthaate hai magar koi sunne vaala nahin he
 Not only Avadh University, you should look at the Hindi newspapers of the first week of June
 patrika, amar ujaalaa, jaagran, hindustan
 Only 20 percent students have passed in Bundelkhand University
 biessi pratham varsh main 88 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 The result of private colleges has been the worst
 sochie privet collejon kaa ye haal he
 Here, again, 3000 rupees have to be paid for a copy check
 nakal roak di gai acchhee baat he magar jo asaliyat saamne ai he wo usase bhi buree bhi baat he
 Why are the results of these colleges so bad? kanpur ke chhatrapati shahu ji maharaj vishvavidhyalay ke nattejey bhi bataa rahe hai ki nakal par roak ke saath saath padhai kii quality par dhyaan dene kii zarurat he
 This video is a few days old
 chaatr fail hone par naaraaz hai or uttar pustika kii dobaaraa jaanch kii maang kar rahe hai
 Registrar Sanjay Kumar told that 93 thousand students appeared in the examination in the first year of b
sc
 inamen se 49
 Only 9 children have passed
 38
 24 percent have failed and close to 11 percent have not appeared for the exam
 biessi part tu main 94620 main sirf 33 pratishat chaatr hi paas ho sake
 Close to 58 percent have failed
 biessi third year main 98 hazaar ke kareeb chaatr pariksha main baithe jisamen 57 percent hi paas hue
 39 percent failed
 kanpur dehaat ke ek college main 130 chaatro main se ek paas hua he
 This is the condition of studies
 chaatro kii maang par cameti bhi bani ki kahin moolyankan main gadabadi to nahin hui magar cameti ne uniwarsity ko clin chit diya he
 a total of 1 lakh 28 thousand students have failed in the three years of b
sc of Kanpur University
 kya yah gambhir masalaa nahin he? ab aap sochie ki kya padhai ho rahi he ki itane chaatr fail ho rahe hai
 What will these contribute to India's productivity or economy
 bharat ke vishvavidhyalayon main pachaas hazaar se ek lakh ke bich lekturer professor ke pad khaali hai
 The administration of the university is happy that it is not allowed to be copied, but is it not a cry that college students failed in college
 unhen kya padhaayaa gaya kya isaki javabdehi kisi kii nahin he
 Why our colleges are so poor that students are not able to pass
 yah sawaal vahaan vetan paa rahe professor lekturer or chaatro teenon se he
 Do students understand what they are doing with themselves? baat sirf kanpur or avadh uniwarsity kii nahin
 On June 4, a news of Pankaj Dabhol appeared in the Times of India
 94 fisadi iti graduate naukari dene ke laayak nahin hai
 This statement is from the CEO of Tech Mahindra
 iti companiyon ko ab apana training centre kholana padaa he
 Top IT companies employ only 6 percent of IT engineers
 ham yah baat kai saal se sun rahe hai ki hamaare ejeeniyar kisi laayak nahin hai
 Common families are paying twenty-two million fees in private colleges by paying loans and after passing it is heard that 94% of IT engineers are not fit to be hired, then with whom is this cheating? kya yah dakaiti nahin he
 Are parents and students not cheated? kya yah sharmnaak nahin he ki bharat kii ejineering kii shiksha itani ghatiya he ki iske collejon se paas 94 fisadi ejeeniyar naukari par rakhe jane laayak nahin hai
 Are the youth not being deceived? kya usne muft main padhai kii thi
 It is better to change your questions or else the situation will not change
 aapako pataa he ki elahabaad main upi lok seva ayog ke baahar chaatro ne pradarshan kiya tha
 They demanded that the question papers of the second innings in the first innings of Hindi have been divided, so the examination should be canceled
 ayog ne pariksha radd bhi kar di magar sirf hindi kii
 Students started demanding that the entire exam be canceled, but the commission said that there was such a mess at the same center, so why cancel the rest of the exam
 is baat ko lekar chaatr ugr hue, police ne lathi charge kii, aath chaatro ko giraftaar kar liya
 Now seven of these students have been released so that they can appear for the examination on 21 June
 magar isamen shaamil samaajawaadee party kii netaa or elahabaad uniwarsity kii purv adhyaksh richa singh ko nahin choda gaya he
 He has been sent to jail
 tippaniyan The tenth result was to come on 20 June in Bihar
 17 lakh se adhik chaatr intazaar kar rahe the magar riselt ab 26 june ko aayega,kyonki aapako bataaya tha ki gopalganj zile main 42 hazaar uttar pustikaayen chori ho gai hai
 The same situation is with the farmers
 uttar pradesh ke amroha main kisaanon ne koi das hazaar bighas main tamaato ugaaya he
 In UP, most tomatoes are in Amroha itself, though mangoes are also very good
 yahaan ke kisaanon ne sadak ke kinare tomaamar phenk diya,kyonki bechney par bhi laagat nahin mil rahaa tha
 There is a crate of 30 kg
 kuch din pehle yahaan kii mandi main 80-90 rupee cret mil rahaa tha yani ek kilo ke 2 se 3 rupee mil rahe the, jabaki ek kilo tamaato ugane main 15 rupee kii laagat aati he
 We are also surprised by the change in the rate after this report from Amroha to Anwar Kamal
 haftaa bhar pehle 80 rupaya cret bhav tha, ab 280 se 290 rupee cret milane laga he
 That is, the price of Rs 8 to 9 kg is being available
 yah bhi kam he magar ek report ke baad 3 rupee se bhav 9 rupee kaise ho gaya he, ham bhi nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 Farmers were saying that last year Pakistan got a lot of price due to export, so this time it took up more land on rent and did farming
 amroha zile main das hazaar bighas main tamaato kii kheti ho gai
 Many farmers are in debt due to loss
 amroha dilli se bahut dur nahin he
 There the farmer is not getting even 10 rupees for a kilo of tomatoes, but today the price of tomatoes was Rs 50 per kg at Katwaria Sarai in South Delhi
 safal main 44 rupaya kilo bhav he
 Now you tell me, in Amroha, the farmer is not getting 3 rupees per kg, while he is investing 15 rupees for growing one kilogram of tomatoes and 50 rupees tomatoes are being sold in Delhi

 a news report from Rajasthan Patrika was seeing that about four lakh applications have been received for the 180 posts of Supervisor in the Department of Women and Child Development

 There is so much competition

 The situation is that within the year, it has become a challenge to get the examinations and give appointment letters

 Now, no one knows when the railway examination will take place

 Look at a picture taken by our colleague Amitesh
 aadmi kab insaan ho jaataa he, kab saamaan ho jaataa he, yah is par nirbhar karata he ki uski jeb main kitne rupee hai
 These young soldiers will protect us as soldiers, but before that they can see what inhuman process they are going through

 Remember the scene of this freight train going towards Mughalsarai

 The young corpses of India are peace-filled youth who should be seen just advertising a job

 There is a procession of those who failed there
 vishvavidhyalay ne is saal pariksha ke dauraan nakal rokane ke liye camere laga die
 The copying has stopped, but the number of people who fail and leave the examination is telling that this university is of no use
 yahaan padhane vaale or naam likhaa kar nahin padhane vaale chaatro ko pataa he ki kahaan professor aate hai, kahaan padhaate hai or kahaan sirf naam likhaaya jaataa he, pariksha paas karaayaa jaataa he or padhai nahin hoti he
 It is not just about Avadh University, we have Jaypee University of Chapra and Dr
 of Muzaffarpur in prime time
 ambedkar bihar uniwarsity kaa bhi haal bataaya tha
 We had told in prime time that around six lakh students appeared in the examination at Awadh University and eighty percent of them failed
 yani 4 lakh 80 hazaar ke kareeb fail ho gaye
 The university released a press release on June 19, presenting the data in such a way that everything looks good
 is relies main likhaa he ki pariksha par prashn chinh lagaaya ja rahaa he
 We had put a question mark on the education here, what is the quality of studies that the number of people who fail to reach copying reaches millions
 kul milakar aankadon kii bazigaari kii gai he
 The difference between the percentage of government-funded colleges and the percentage of self-run colleges has been reported
 hamane overol jodakar bataaya tha ki 2017-18 main bie biessi, bi com ke teenon saal ke or post graduate str ke sava chah lakh chaatro ne pariksha di thi
 If 80 percent failed, then about 4 lakh 80,000 students failed due to this
 biessi third year ke 80 pratishat se adhik chaatr fail hai
 In BSC first year, 56 percent students have failed
 sultanpur ke ganpat sahay post graduate mahavidhyalay ke ganit main final year main kareeb 300 chaatr the lekin inamen se maatr 20-25 chaatr paas hue hai
 Nearly 275 have failed
 19 june ko vaais chancelar ne ek meeting kar aankadon ko is tarah pesh kiya he jisase na lage ki chaar lakh bachche fail ho gaye
 Our emphasis is on why the quality of studies is so poor that students leave or fail in the name of stopping copying
 ham kab tak bhaagenge is sawaal se kya tab tak jab tak bharat ke saare noujvaan barbaad nahin kar die jate
 The June 19 press release lists the number of BA bcom BAC students and their percentages, but the pass percentage has been distributed among government-funded and self-funded institutions so that it does not look as if studying in government institutions Level is poor
 biessi dwitiya varsh main 23,358 chaatr shaamil hue or 20 pratishat safal hue
 Is it not shameful that 80 percent of the students fail? In BSC III year, 34,091 students attended and 19
 18 pratishat chaatr safal hue
 Is it not shameful that more than 80 percent of the students fail? 77,259 students attended and 59 in BA First Year
 95 pratishat paas hue
 Is it not shameful that 40 percent of the students fail? 61,610 students attended the BA Second Year and 79
 86 pratishat paas hue
 Isn't it embarrassing for 20 percent of the students to fail? 40,442 students attended and 43 in bsc first year
 01 pratishat paas hue
 Isn't it embarrassing for 57 percent of the students to fail? yahi khel he
 The percentage of students who failed is divided into government and private
 agar privet main rigelt itnaa kharaab he to vishvavidhyalay yah bataae ki vah kya ection lene ja rahaa he
 The pass percentage in government-funded colleges may be between 50 and 70 percent in sight, but the failure of 20 to 40 percent students is also a question on its quality
 par ek baat samaj nahin ai
 On February 22, before the examination started, the Vice Chancellor of the University, Manoj Dixit, said in a press conference that this time six lakh 11 thousand 680 students will be included in the graduation examinations
 magar 19 june kii press release main jo hisaab diya he uske anusaar to pariksha dene vaale chaatro kii sankhya 3 lakh 31 hazaar 239 hi he
 We did not understand where the remaining 2 lakh 80 thousand 441 students went
 kya bibie or bisie jaise course kaa hisaab isamen se hataa diya gaya he taaki fail hone vaale chaatro kii total sankhya kam lage
 We had shown in the University Series that many colleges in Awadh University do not have sufficient number of teachers
 kai collejon main sirf kaagaj par hi hai vahaan padhai nahin hoti
 i raised this question not for myself but for the children of ordinary families of that poor area, why are they being given poor quality education
 ab uniwarsity ne kaha he ki 100 uttar pustikaon ke sample duusari uniwarsity main jaanch ke liye bheje jaaenge taaki isaki pushti ho sake ki jaanch main gadabadi to nahin hui he
 There will be no fee for this and students can apply to include their copy in this 100 copy if they wish
 kya yah ajeeb nahi he
 If five hundred students apply then what will the university do
 hamaara sawaal ek or he ek garib ilaake ke chaatro se uttar pustika kii jaanch ke liye 3000 rupee lenaa kahaan tak uchit he
 This system came into force 6 months ago or is implemented now
 It does not mean that the question of why 3000 rupees will be taken for investigation
 galati uniwarsity kii or paisa chaatr kaa
 The system here is to give Rs 300 first and then get a photo copy of the answer book
 usamen lagata he ki gadabadi hui he to phir 3000 hazaar dijie taaki jaanch ho
 What is the intelligence to earn money
 avadh uniwarsity hi nahin duusari kai uniwarsity main yah sab hone laga he
 Students raise questions but no one is listening
 avadh uniwarsity hi nahin aap june ke pehle saptaah ke hindi ke akhabaaron ko dekhie

 Copying has been stopped is a good thing, but the reality that has come out is worse than that

 The results of Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University of Kanpur are also showing that apart from stopping the copying, there is a need to pay attention to the quality of studies

 a committee was also formed on the demand of students that there was no disturbance in the assessment, but the committee has given a clean chit to the university
 kanpur uniwarsity ke biessi ke teenon saal main kul 1 lakh 28 hazaar chaatr fail hue hai
 Isn't this a serious issue? Now think what is going on in studies that so many students are failing

 You know that students demonstrated outside the UP Public Service Commission in Allahabad
 inaki maang thi ki hindi kii pehali pari main duusari pari ke prashn patr bant gaye hai, isliye pariksha radd ho
 The Commission also canceled the examination but did only Hindi
 chaatr maang karne lage ki sari pariksha radd ho magar ayog kaa kahana tha ki ek hi centre par aisi gadabadi hui he, isliye baaki pariksha kyon radd karen
 Students were agitated about this, police charged lathi, arrested eight students
 ab inamen se saat chaatro ko chhod diya gaya he taaki ve 21 june kii pariksha main shaamil ho saken
 But the Samajwadi Party leader and former Allahabad University president Richa Singh has not been left out

 More than 17 lakh students were waiting, but the result will now come on 26 June, because you were told that 42 thousand answer sheets have been stolen in Gopalganj district

 In Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, farmers have grown tomatoes in ten thousand bighas
 upi main sabase adhik tamaato amroha main hi hota he vaise aam bhi khub hota he
 The farmers here threw the tamaras on the side of the road, because the cost was not available even if they were sold
 30 kilo kaa ek cret hota he
 a few days ago, there was a crate of 80-90 rupees in the mandi here, that is, 2 to 3 rupees per kg, while it costs Rs 15 to grow one kg of tomatoes

 a week ago, there was a crate price of 80 rupees, now 280 to 290 crates are available
 yani 8 rupee se 9 rupee kilo ke bhav mil rahe hai
 This is also less, but after a report, how the price has gone from 3 rupees to 9 rupees, we are unable to understand
 kisaan kah rahe the ki pichley saal pakistan niryaat ke kaaran khub bhav mila to is baar zyaada zamin kiraaye par lekar kheti kar lee
 In Amroha district, tomato cultivated in ten thousand bighas

 Amroha is not far from Delhi
 vahaan kisaan ko ek kilo tamaato ke 10 rupee bhi nahin mil rahe hai lekin aaj hi dakshin dilli ke katwaria sarai main tamaato kaa bhav 50 rupee kilo tha
 There is a price of 44 rupees kg in the successful
 ab aap hi bataaiye amroha main kisaan ko 3 rupee kilo bhav nahin mil rahe hai, jabaki vah ek kilo tomaamar ugane main 15 rupee laga de rahaa he or dilli main 50 rupee kilo tamaato bik rahaa he
 You are also being plundered and the farmer is also being plundered

 biessi dwitiya varsh main 23,358 chaatr shaamil hue or 20 pratishat safal hue
 Is it not shameful that 80 percent of the students fail? In BSC III year, 34,091 students attended and 19
 18 pratishat chaatr safal hue
 Is it not shameful that more than 80 percent of the students fail? 77,259 students attended and 59 in BA First Year
 95 pratishat paas hue
 Is it not shameful that 40 percent of the students fail? 61,610 students attended the BA Second Year and 79
 86 pratishat paas hue
 Isn't it embarrassing for 20 percent of the students to fail? 40,442 students attended and 43 in bsc first year
 01 pratishat paas hue
 Isn't it embarrassing for 57 percent of the students to fail? yahi khel he
 The percentage of students who failed is divided into government and private
 agar privet main rigelt itnaa kharaab he to vishvavidhyalay yah bataae ki vah kya ection lene ja rahaa he
 The pass percentage in government-funded colleges may be between 50 and 70 percent in sight, but the failure of 20 to 40 percent students is also a question on its quality
 par ek baat samaj nahin ai
 On February 22, before the examination started, the Vice Chancellor of the University, Manoj Dixit, said in a press conference that this time six lakh 11 thousand 680 students will be included in the graduation examinations
 magar 19 june kii press release main jo hisaab diya he uske anusaar to pariksha dene vaale chaatro kii sankhya 3 lakh 31 hazaar 239 hi he
 We did not understand where the remaining 2 lakh 80 thousand 441 students went
 kya bibie or bisie jaise course kaa hisaab isamen se hataa diya gaya he taaki fail hone vaale chaatro kii total sankhya kam lage
 We had shown in the University Series that many colleges in Awadh University do not have sufficient number of teachers
 kai collejon main sirf kaagaj par hi hai vahaan padhai nahin hoti
 i raised this question not for myself but for the children of ordinary families of that poor area, why are they being given poor quality education
 ab uniwarsity ne kaha he ki 100 uttar pustikaon ke sample duusari uniwarsity main jaanch ke liye bheje jaaenge taaki isaki pushti ho sake ki jaanch main gadabadi to nahin hui he
 There will be no fee for this and students can apply to include their copy in this 100 copy if they wish
 kya yah ajeeb nahi he
 If five hundred students apply then what will the university do
 hamaara sawaal ek or he ek garib ilaake ke chaatro se uttar pustika kii jaanch ke liye 3000 rupee lenaa kahaan tak uchit he
 This system came into force 6 months ago or is implemented now
 It does not mean that the question of why 3000 rupees will be taken for investigation
 galati uniwarsity kii or paisa chaatr kaa
 The system here is to give Rs 300 first and then get a photo copy of the answer book
 usamen lagata he ki gadabadi hui he to phir 3000 hazaar dijie taaki jaanch ho
 What is the intelligence to earn money
 avadh uniwarsity hi nahin duusari kai uniwarsity main yah sab hone laga he
 Students raise questions but no one is listening
 avadh uniwarsity hi nahin aap june ke pehle saptaah ke hindi ke akhabaaron ko dekhie
 Magazine, Amar Ujala, Jagran, Hindustan
 bundelkhand vishvavidhyalay main 20 pratishat chaatr hi paas hue hai
 In BSC first year 88 percent students have failed
 privet collejon kaa riselt sabase kharaab rahaa he
 Think this is the condition of private colleges
 yahaan bhi dobaaraa copy check karaane ke liye 3000 rupee dene padate hai
 Copying has been stopped is a good thing, but the reality that has come out is worse than that
 in collejon kaa rigelt itnaa kharaab kyon hai
 The results of Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University of Kanpur are also showing that apart from stopping the copying, there is a need to pay attention to the quality of studies
 yah video kuch din purana he
 The students are angry at the failure and are demanding a re-examination of the answer sheet
 register sanjay kumaar ne bataaya biessi pratham varsh main 93 hazaar chaatr pariksha main shaamil hue the
 49 of these
 9 bachche hi paas hue hai
 38
 24 pratishat fail hue hai or 11 pratishat ke kareeb pariksha main baithe hi nahin
 In BSC Part Two, only 33 percent of the students could pass in 94620
 58 pratishat ke kareeb fail hue hai
 In BSC Third Year, close to 98 thousand students appeared in the examination, in which only 57% passed
 39 percent fail ho gaye
 One in 130 students passed out in a college in Kanpur Dehat
 ye haal he padhai kaa
 a committee was also formed on the demand of students that there was no disturbance in the assessment, but the committee has given a clean chit to the university
 kanpur uniwarsity ke biessi ke teenon saal main kul 1 lakh 28 hazaar chaatr fail hue hai
 Isn't this a serious issue? Now think what is going on in studies that so many students are failing
 ye bharat kii utpaadakta yaa arthvyavastha main kya yogadan karenge
 Between fifty thousand and one lakh lecturers professor positions are vacant in universities in India
 uniwarsity kaa prashasan khush he ki nakal nahin hone di lekin kya yah rone vaali baat nahin he ki college ke college chaatr fail ho gaye
 No one is accountable for what they have been taught
 kyon hamaare collejon kii padhai itani kharaab he ki chaatr paas hone laayak nahin hai
 This question is from the three lecturers and students who are getting salaries
 kya chaatr samaj rahe hai ki ve apane saath kya kar rahe hai
 It is not just about Kanpur and Awadh University
 isi 4 june ko times of india main pankaj dabhol kii ek khabar chhapi he
 94 percent of IT graduates are not eligible for employment
 yah bayaan tech mahindra ke siio kaa he
 IT companies now have to open their own training centers
 chotii kii iti companiyaan maatr 6 pratishat iti ejeeniyar ko naukari par rakhti hai
 We have been hearing for many years that our engineers are not fit
 aam parivaar karz lekar bees-bees lakh fees dekar privet collejon main padhaa rahe hai or paas hone ke baad yah sunne ko mili ki 94 fisadi iti ejeeniyar naukari par rakhe jane laayak nahin hai to yah kiske saath dhokhaa he
 Isn't it a robbery? kya maa baap or chaatr ke saath dhokhaa nahin hai
 Isn't it shameful that India's engineering education is so inferior that 94 per cent of engineers from its colleges are not fit to be hired? kya naujavaanon ke saath dhokhaa nahin ho rahaa he
 Did she study for free? behatar he apane sawaal badal len varanaa halaat nahin badalenge
 You know that students demonstrated outside the UP Public Service Commission in Allahabad
 inaki maang thi ki hindi kii pehali pari main duusari pari ke prashn patr bant gaye hai, isliye pariksha radd ho
 The Commission also canceled the examination but did only Hindi
 chaatr maang karne lage ki sari pariksha radd ho magar ayog kaa kahana tha ki ek hi centre par aisi gadabadi hui he, isliye baaki pariksha kyon radd karen
 Students were agitated about this, police charged lathi, arrested eight students
 ab inamen se saat chaatro ko chhod diya gaya he taaki ve 21 june kii pariksha main shaamil ho saken
 But the Samajwadi Party leader and former Allahabad University president Richa Singh has not been left out
 unhen jail bhej diya gaya he
 The comments bihar main 20 june ko dasvin kaa riselt aana tha
 More than 17 lakh students were waiting, but the result will now come on 26 June, because you were told that 42 thousand answer sheets have been stolen in Gopalganj district
 yahi haal kisaanon kaa he
 In Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, farmers have grown tomatoes in ten thousand bighas
 upi main sabase adhik tamaato amroha main hi hota he vaise aam bhi khub hota he
 The farmers here threw the tamaras on the side of the road, because the cost was not available even if they were sold
 30 kilo kaa ek cret hota he
 a few days ago, there was a crate of 80-90 rupees in the mandi here, that is, 2 to 3 rupees per kg, while it costs Rs 15 to grow one kg of tomatoes
 amroha se anwar kamaal kii is report ke baad jo rate main badlaav aayaa he usase ham bhi hairaan he
 a week ago, there was a crate price of 80 rupees, now 280 to 290 crates are available
 yani 8 rupee se 9 rupee kilo ke bhav mil rahe hai
 This is also less, but after a report, how the price has gone from 3 rupees to 9 rupees, we are unable to understand
 kisaan kah rahe the ki pichley saal pakistan niryaat ke kaaran khub bhav mila to is baar zyaada zamin kiraaye par lekar kheti kar lee
 In Amroha district, tomato cultivated in ten thousand bighas
 kai kisaan nuksaan ke kaaran karze main aa gaye hai
 Amroha is not far from Delhi
 vahaan kisaan ko ek kilo tamaato ke 10 rupee bhi nahin mil rahe hai lekin aaj hi dakshin dilli ke katwaria sarai main tamaato kaa bhav 50 rupee kilo tha
 There is a price of 44 rupees kg in the successful
 ab aap hi bataaiye amroha main kisaan ko 3 rupee kilo bhav nahin mil rahe hai, jabaki vah ek kilo tomaamar ugane main 15 rupee laga de rahaa he or dilli main 50 rupee kilo tamaato bik rahaa he
 You are also being plundered and the farmer is also being plundered
 phir yah koun he jo 47 rupee kaa munafa le ja rahaa he
 No one is offering concrete solutions to these questions
 raajnneeti gappabaazi main badal gai he
 You have to decide whether to listen to the chat or see the work
 hamane prime time main bataaya tha ki avadh uniwarsity main chah lakh ke kareeb chaatr pariksha main shaamil hue the or inamen se assi fisadi chaatr fail ho gaye
 That means around 4 lakh 80 thousand have failed
 uniwarsity ne 19 june ko ek press relies jari kar aankadon ko aise pesh kiya he ki sab kuch acha acha dikhe
 It is written in this release that a question mark is being put on the exam
 hamane yahaan kii padhai par prashn chinh lagaaya tha ki padhai kii kya quality he ki nakal rokane par fail hone vaale kii sankhya lakhon main pahunch jaati he
 Overall, the data is marketed
 sarkaar dwaara anudaan praapt collejon ke paas pratishat or khud se chalane vaale collejon ke paas pratishat main antar bataaya gaya he
 We had added that overall, in 2017-18, BA and b
sc, b
com three-year and post-graduate level six and a half million students took the exam
 80 pratishat fail ho gaye to is hisaab se fail hone vaale chaatro kii sankhya kareeb 4 lakh 80,000 ke kareeb chaatr fail hai
 Over 80 percent of BSC third year students fail
 biessi pratham varsh main 56 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 Ganapat Sahay Post Graduate College of Sultanpur had about 300 students in the final year in mathematics but only 20-25 of these have passed
 275 ke kareeb fail ho gaye hai
 On 19 June, the Vice Chancellor held a meeting and presented the data in such a way that four lakh children failed
 hamaara jor is par he ki padhai kii quality itani ghatiya kyon he ki chaatr nakal rokane ke naam par pariksha chhod dete hai yaa fail ho jate hai
 How long will we run away from this question until all the youth of India are destroyed
 19 june kii press relies main bie bikom birsi ke chaatro kii sankhya di gai he or unke paas pratishat die gaye hai, magar paas pratishat ko sarkari anudaan praapt or swany vitt poshit sansthaanon main baat diya gaya he taaki ye na lage ki sarkari sansthaanon main padhai kaa str kharaab he
 23,358 students joined the BSC second year and 20 percent were successful
 kya 80 fisadi chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? biessi tritiy varsh main 34,091 chaatr shaamil hue or 19
 18 percent of students were successful
 kya 80 pratishat se adhik chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? bie first year main 77,259 chaatr shaamil hue or 59

 kya 40 pratishat chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? bie second year main 61,610 chaatr shaamil hue or 79

 01 percent passed
 kya 57 pratishat chaatro kaa fail ho janaa sharmnaak nahin he? This is the game
 fail hone vaale chaatro kaa pratishat sarkari or privet main baant diya gaya he
 If the result in private is so bad, then the university should tell what action it is going to take
 sarkari anudaan praapt collejon main paas pratishat bhale hi dekhne main 50 se 70 pratishat ke bich dikh rahaa he magar 20 se 40 pratishat chaatro kaa fail hona bhi uski clavity par sawaal he
 But one thing was not understood
 pariksha shuru hone se pehle 22 farvari ko vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati manoj dikshit ne press conference main kaha tha ki is baar snaatak str kii parikshaon main chah lakh 11 hazaar 680 chaatr shaamil honge
 But according to the calculation given in the press release of June 19, the number of students taking the exam is only 3 lakh 31 thousand 239
 hamen samaj nahin aayaa ki baaki ke 2 lakh 80 hazaar 441 chaatr kahaan gaye
 Has the calculation of courses like BBA and BCA been removed from it so that the total number of students who failed is reduced
 hamane uniwarsity series main dikhaaya tha ki avadh uniwarsity ke kai collejon main paryaapt sankhya main shikshak nahin hai
 Many colleges are only on paper, there is no education there
 yah sawaal maine apane liye nahin balki us garib ilaake ke saadhaaran pariwaron ke bacchon ke liye uthaaya tha ki aakhir unhen ghatiya quality kii shiksha kyon di ja rahi he
 Now the university has said that samples of 100 answer sheets will be sent to another university for examination so that it can be confirmed that there is no disturbance in the investigation
 iske liye fees nahin lagegi or chaatr chahen to is 100 copy main apni copy shaamil karaane kaa aavedan de sakate hai
 Isn't it strange? agar paanch sau chaatro ne aavedan kar diya to phir uniwarsity kya karegi
 Our question is another, how far is it appropriate to take Rs 3000 from students of a poor area to check the answer book
 yah vyavastha 6 maah pehle lagu hui yaa ab lagu hui isse matlab nahin he sawaal he ki 3000 rupee jaanch ke kyon liye jaaenge
 Mistake of university and money of student
 yahaan system yah he ki 300 rupee pehle dijie phir uttar pustika kii photo copy hasil kiijie
 If it seems that there is a disturbance then give 3000 thousand so that the investigation can be done
 kya hoshiyaari he paisa kamaane kii
 Not only Avadh University, this is happening in many other universities
 chaatr sawaal uthaate hai magar koi sunne vaala nahin he
 Not only Avadh University, you should look at the Hindi newspapers of the first week of June
 patrika, amar ujaalaa, jaagran, hindustan
 Only 20 percent students have passed in Bundelkhand University
 biessi pratham varsh main 88 pratishat chaatr fail ho gaye hai
 The result of private colleges has been the worst
 sochie privet collejon kaa ye haal he
 Here, again, 3000 rupees have to be paid for a copy check
 nakal roak di gai acchhee baat he magar jo asaliyat saamne ai he wo usase bhi buree bhi baat he
 Why are the results of these colleges so bad? kanpur ke chhatrapati shahu ji maharaj vishvavidhyalay ke nattejey bhi bataa rahe hai ki nakal par roak ke saath saath padhai kii quality par dhyaan dene kii zarurat he
 This video is a few days old

 What will these contribute to India's productivity or economy
 bharat ke vishvavidhyalayon main pachaas hazaar se ek lakh ke bich lekturer professor ke pad khaali hai
 The administration of the university is happy that it is not allowed to be copied, but is it not a cry that college students failed in college
 unhen kya padhaayaa gaya kya isaki javabdehi kisi kii nahin he
 Why our colleges are so poor that students are not able to pass
 yah sawaal vahaan vetan paa rahe professor lekturer or chaatro teenon se he
 Do students understand what they are doing with themselves? baat sirf kanpur or avadh uniwarsity kii nahin
 On June 4, a news of Pankaj Dabhol appeared in the Times of India
 94 fisadi iti graduate naukari dene ke laayak nahin hai
 This statement is from the CEO of Tech Mahindra
 iti companiyon ko ab apana training centre kholana padaa he
 Top IT companies employ only 6 percent of IT engineers
 ham yah baat kai saal se sun rahe hai ki hamaare ejeeniyar kisi laayak nahin hai
 Common families are paying twenty-two million fees in private colleges by paying loans and after passing it is heard that 94% of IT engineers are not fit to be hired, then with whom is this cheating? kya yah dakaiti nahin he
 Are parents and students not cheated? kya yah sharmnaak nahin he ki bharat kii ejineering kii shiksha itani ghatiya he ki iske collejon se paas 94 fisadi ejeeniyar naukari par rakhe jane laayak nahin hai
 Are the youth not being deceived? kya usne muft main padhai kii thi
 It is better to change your questions or else the situation will not change
 aapako pataa he ki elahabaad main upi lok seva ayog ke baahar chaatro ne pradarshan kiya tha
 They demanded that the question papers of the second innings in the first innings of Hindi have been divided, so the examination should be canceled
 ayog ne pariksha radd bhi kar di magar sirf hindi kii
 Students started demanding that the entire exam be canceled, but the commission said that there was such a mess at the same center, so why cancel the rest of the exam
 is baat ko lekar chaatr ugr hue, police ne lathi charge kii, aath chaatro ko giraftaar kar liya
 Now seven of these students have been released so that they can appear for the examination on 21 June
 magar isamen shaamil samaajawaadee party kii netaa or elahabaad uniwarsity kii purv adhyaksh richa singh ko nahin choda gaya he
 He has been sent to jail
 tippaniyan The tenth result was to come on 20 June in Bihar
 17 lakh se adhik chaatr intazaar kar rahe the magar riselt ab 26 june ko aayega,kyonki aapako bataaya tha ki gopalganj zile main 42 hazaar uttar pustikaayen chori ho gai hai
 The same situation is with the farmers
 uttar pradesh ke amroha main kisaanon ne koi das hazaar bighas main tamaato ugaaya he
 In UP, most tomatoes are in Amroha itself, though mangoes are also very good
 yahaan ke kisaanon ne sadak ke kinare tomaamar phenk diya,kyonki bechney par bhi laagat nahin mil rahaa tha
 There is a crate of 30 kg
 kuch din pehle yahaan kii mandi main 80-90 rupee cret mil rahaa tha yani ek kilo ke 2 se 3 rupee mil rahe the, jabaki ek kilo tamaato ugane main 15 rupee kii laagat aati he
 We are also surprised by the change in the rate after this report from Amroha to Anwar Kamal
 haftaa bhar pehle 80 rupaya cret bhav tha, ab 280 se 290 rupee cret milane laga he
 That is, the price of Rs 8 to 9 kg is being available
 yah bhi kam he magar ek report ke baad 3 rupee se bhav 9 rupee kaise ho gaya he, ham bhi nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 Farmers were saying that last year Pakistan got a lot of price due to export, so this time it took up more land on rent and did farming
 amroha zile main das hazaar bighas main tamaato kii kheti ho gai
 Many farmers are in debt due to loss
 amroha dilli se bahut dur nahin he
 There the farmer is not getting even 10 rupees for a kilo of tomatoes, but today the price of tomatoes was Rs 50 per kg at Katwaria Sarai in South Delhi
 safal main 44 rupaya kilo bhav he
 Now you tell me, in Amroha, the farmer is not getting 3 rupees per kg, while he is investing 15 rupees for growing one kilogram of tomatoes and 50 rupees tomatoes are being sold in Delhi
 aap bhi lut rahe hai or kisaan bhi lut rahaa he
 Then who is it that is carrying a profit of 47 rupees
 in sawaalon kaa thos samaadhaan koi pesh nahin kar rahaa he
 Politics has turned into gossip

 That is, the price of Rs 8 to 9 kg is being available

 Now you tell me, in Amroha, the farmer is not getting 3 rupees per kg, while he is investing 15 rupees for growing one kilogram of tomatoes and 50 rupees tomatoes are being sold in Delhi
 aap bhi lut rahe hai or kisaan bhi lut rahaa he
 Then who is it that is carrying a profit of 47 rupees
 in sawaalon kaa thos samaadhaan koi pesh nahin kar rahaa he

 On 19 June, the Vice Chancellor held a meeting and presented the data in such a way that four lakh children failed
 hamaara jor is par he ki padhai kii quality itani ghatiya kyon he ki chaatr nakal rokane ke naam par pariksha chhod dete hai yaa fail ho jate hai
 How long will we run away from this question until all the youth of India are destroyed

 hamen samaj nahin aayaa ki baaki ke 2 lakh 80 hazaar 441 chaatr kahaan gaye
 Has the calculation of courses like BBA and BCA been removed from it so that the total number of students who failed is reduced

 Many colleges are only on paper, there is no education there

 Now the university has said that samples of 100 answer sheets will be sent to another university for examination so that it can be confirmed that there is no disturbance in the investigation
 iske liye fees nahin lagegi or chaatr chahen to is 100 copy main apni copy shaamil karaane kaa aavedan de sakate hai
 Isn't it strange? agar paanch sau chaatro ne aavedan kar diya to phir uniwarsity kya karegi
 Our question is another, how far is it appropriate to take Rs 3000 from students of a poor area to check the answer book
 yah vyavastha 6 maah pehle lagu hui yaa ab lagu hui isse matlab nahin he sawaal he ki 3000 rupee jaanch ke kyon liye jaaenge

 What will these contribute to India's productivity or economy
 bharat ke vishvavidhyalayon main pachaas hazaar se ek lakh ke bich lekturer professor ke pad khaali hai
 The administration of the university is happy that it is not allowed to be copied, but is it not a cry that college students failed in college
 unhen kya padhaayaa gaya kya isaki javabdehi kisi kii nahin he
 Why our colleges are so poor that students are not able to pass
 yah sawaal vahaan vetan paa rahe professor lekturer or chaatro teenon se he
 Do students understand what they are doing with themselves? baat sirf kanpur or avadh uniwarsity kii nahin
 On June 4, a news of Pankaj Dabhol appeared in the Times of India
 94 fisadi iti graduate naukari dene ke laayak nahin hai
 This statement is from the CEO of Tech Mahindra
 iti companiyon ko ab apana training centre kholana padaa he
 Top IT companies employ only 6 percent of IT engineers
 ham yah baat kai saal se sun rahe hai ki hamaare ejeeniyar kisi laayak nahin hai
 Common families are paying twenty-two million fees in private colleges by paying loans and after passing it is heard that 94% of IT engineers are not fit to be hired, then with whom is this cheating? kya yah dakaiti nahin he
 Are parents and students not cheated? kya yah sharmnaak nahin he ki bharat kii ejineering kii shiksha itani ghatiya he ki iske collejon se paas 94 fisadi ejeeniyar naukari par rakhe jane laayak nahin hai
 Are the youth not being deceived? kya usne muft main padhai kii thi
 It is better to change your questions or else the situation will not change
 aapako pataa he ki elahabaad main upi lok seva ayog ke baahar chaatro ne pradarshan kiya tha
 They demanded that the question papers of the second innings in the first innings of Hindi have been divided, so the examination should be canceled
 ayog ne pariksha radd bhi kar di magar sirf hindi kii
 Students started demanding that the entire exam be canceled, but the commission said that there was such a mess at the same center, so why cancel the rest of the exam
 is baat ko lekar chaatr ugr hue, police ne lathi charge kii, aath chaatro ko giraftaar kar liya
 Now seven of these students have been released so that they can appear for the examination on 21 June
 magar isamen shaamil samaajawaadee party kii netaa or elahabaad uniwarsity kii purv adhyaksh richa singh ko nahin choda gaya he
 He has been sent to jail
 tippaniyan The tenth result was to come on 20 June in Bihar
 17 lakh se adhik chaatr intazaar kar rahe the magar riselt ab 26 june ko aayega,kyonki aapako bataaya tha ki gopalganj zile main 42 hazaar uttar pustikaayen chori ho gai hai
 The same situation is with the farmers
 uttar pradesh ke amroha main kisaanon ne koi das hazaar bighas main tamaato ugaaya he
 In UP, most tomatoes are in Amroha itself, though mangoes are also very good
 yahaan ke kisaanon ne sadak ke kinare tomaamar phenk diya,kyonki bechney par bhi laagat nahin mil rahaa tha
 There is a crate of 30 kg
 kuch din pehle yahaan kii mandi main 80-90 rupee cret mil rahaa tha yani ek kilo ke 2 se 3 rupee mil rahe the, jabaki ek kilo tamaato ugane main 15 rupee kii laagat aati he
 We are also surprised by the change in the rate after this report from Amroha to Anwar Kamal
 haftaa bhar pehle 80 rupaya cret bhav tha, ab 280 se 290 rupee cret milane laga he
 That is, the price of Rs 8 to 9 kg is being available
 yah bhi kam he magar ek report ke baad 3 rupee se bhav 9 rupee kaise ho gaya he, ham bhi nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 Farmers were saying that last year Pakistan got a lot of price due to export, so this time it took up more land on rent and did farming
 amroha zile main das hazaar bighas main tamaato kii kheti ho gai
 Many farmers are in debt due to loss
 amroha dilli se bahut dur nahin he
 There the farmer is not getting even 10 rupees for a kilo of tomatoes, but today the price of tomatoes was Rs 50 per kg at Katwaria Sarai in South Delhi
 safal main 44 rupaya kilo bhav he
 Now you tell me, in Amroha, the farmer is not getting 3 rupees per kg, while he is investing 15 rupees for growing one kilogram of tomatoes and 50 rupees tomatoes are being sold in Delhi
 aap bhi lut rahe hai or kisaan bhi lut rahaa he
 Then who is it that is carrying a profit of 47 rupees
 in sawaalon kaa thos samaadhaan koi pesh nahin kar rahaa he
 Politics has turned into gossip
 tay aapako karnaa he ki gapp hi sunanaa he yaa kaam bhi dekhnaa he
 We had shown in the University Series that many colleges in Awadh University do not have sufficient number of teachers
 kai collejon main sirf kaagaj par hi hai vahaan padhai nahin hoti
 i raised this question not for myself but for the children of ordinary families of that poor area, why are they being given poor quality education
 ab uniwarsity ne kaha he ki 100 uttar pustikaon ke sample duusari uniwarsity main jaanch ke liye bheje jaaenge taaki isaki pushti ho sake ki jaanch main gadabadi to nahin hui he
 There will be no fee for this and students can apply to include their copy in this 100 copy if they wish
 kya yah ajeeb nahi he
 If five hundred students apply then what will the university do
 hamaara sawaal ek or he ek garib ilaake ke chaatro se uttar pustika kii jaanch ke liye 3000 rupee lenaa kahaan tak uchit he
 This system came into force 6 months ago or is implemented now
 It does not mean that the question of why 3000 rupees will be taken for investigation
 galati uniwarsity kii or paisa chaatr kaa
 The system here is to give Rs 300 first and then get a photo copy of the answer book
 usamen lagata he ki gadabadi hui he to phir 3000 hazaar dijie taaki jaanch ho
 What is the intelligence to earn money
 avadh uniwarsity hi nahin duusari kai uniwarsity main yah sab hone laga he
 Students raise questions but no one is listening
 avadh uniwarsity hi nahin aap june ke pehle saptaah ke hindi ke akhabaaron ko dekhie
 Magazine, Amar Ujala, Jagran, Hindustan
 bundelkhand vishvavidhyalay main 20 pratishat chaatr hi paas hue hai
 In BSC first year 88 percent students have failed
 privet collejon kaa riselt sabase kharaab rahaa he
 Think this is the condition of private colleges
 yahaan bhi dobaaraa copy check karaane ke liye 3000 rupee dene padate hai
 Copying has been stopped is a good thing, but the reality that has come out is worse than that
 in collejon kaa rigelt itnaa kharaab kyon hai
 The results of Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University of Kanpur are also showing that apart from stopping the copying, there is a need to pay attention to the quality of studies
 yah video kuch din purana he
 The students are angry at the failure and are demanding a re-examination of the answer sheet
 register sanjay kumaar ne bataaya biessi pratham varsh main 93 hazaar chaatr pariksha main shaamil hue the
 49 of these
 9 bachche hi paas hue hai
 38
 24 pratishat fail hue hai or 11 pratishat ke kareeb pariksha main baithe hi nahin
 In BSC Part Two, only 33 percent of the students could pass in 94620
 58 pratishat ke kareeb fail hue hai
 In BSC Third Year, close to 98 thousand students appeared in the examination, in which only 57% passed
 39 percent fail ho gaye
 One in 130 students passed out in a college in Kanpur Dehat
 ye haal he padhai kaa
 a committee was also formed on the demand of students that there was no disturbance in the assessment, but the committee has given a clean chit to the university
 kanpur uniwarsity ke biessi ke teenon saal main kul 1 lakh 28 hazaar chaatr fail hue hai
 Isn't this a serious issue? Now think what is going on in studies that so many students are failing
 ye bharat kii utpaadakta yaa arthvyavastha main kya yogadan karenge
 Between fifty thousand and one lakh lecturers professor positions are vacant in universities in India
 uniwarsity kaa prashasan khush he ki nakal nahin hone di lekin kya yah rone vaali baat nahin he ki college ke college chaatr fail ho gaye
 No one is accountable for what they have been taught
 kyon hamaare collejon kii padhai itani kharaab he ki chaatr paas hone laayak nahin hai
 This question is from the three lecturers and students who are getting salaries
 kya chaatr samaj rahe hai ki ve apane saath kya kar rahe hai
 It is not just about Kanpur and Awadh University
 isi 4 june ko times of india main pankaj dabhol kii ek khabar chhapi he
 94 percent of IT graduates are not eligible for employment
 yah bayaan tech mahindra ke siio kaa he
 IT companies now have to open their own training centers
 chotii kii iti companiyaan maatr 6 pratishat iti ejeeniyar ko naukari par rakhti hai
 We have been hearing for many years that our engineers are not fit
 aam parivaar karz lekar bees-bees lakh fees dekar privet collejon main padhaa rahe hai or paas hone ke baad yah sunne ko mili ki 94 fisadi iti ejeeniyar naukari par rakhe jane laayak nahin hai to yah kiske saath dhokhaa he
 Isn't it a robbery? kya maa baap or chaatr ke saath dhokhaa nahin hai
 Isn't it shameful that India's engineering education is so inferior that 94 per cent of engineers from its colleges are not fit to be hired? kya naujavaanon ke saath dhokhaa nahin ho rahaa he
 Did she study for free? behatar he apane sawaal badal len varanaa halaat nahin badalenge
 You know that students demonstrated outside the UP Public Service Commission in Allahabad
 inaki maang thi ki hindi kii pehali pari main duusari pari ke prashn patr bant gaye hai, isliye pariksha radd ho
 The Commission also canceled the examination but did only Hindi
 chaatr maang karne lage ki sari pariksha radd ho magar ayog kaa kahana tha ki ek hi centre par aisi gadabadi hui he, isliye baaki pariksha kyon radd karen
 Students were agitated about this, police charged lathi, arrested eight students
 ab inamen se saat chaatro ko chhod diya gaya he taaki ve 21 june kii pariksha main shaamil ho saken
 But the Samajwadi Party leader and former Allahabad University president Richa Singh has not been left out
 unhen jail bhej diya gaya he
 The comments bihar main 20 june ko dasvin kaa riselt aana tha
 More than 17 lakh students were waiting, but the result will now come on 26 June, because you were told that 42 thousand answer sheets have been stolen in Gopalganj district
 yahi haal kisaanon kaa he
 In Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, farmers have grown tomatoes in ten thousand bighas
 upi main sabase adhik tamaato amroha main hi hota he vaise aam bhi khub hota he
 The farmers here threw the tamaras on the side of the road, because the cost was not available even if they were sold
 30 kilo kaa ek cret hota he
 a few days ago, there was a crate of 80-90 rupees in the mandi here, that is, 2 to 3 rupees per kg, while it costs Rs 15 to grow one kg of tomatoes
 amroha se anwar kamaal kii is report ke baad jo rate main badlaav aayaa he usase ham bhi hairaan he
 a week ago, there was a crate price of 80 rupees, now 280 to 290 crates are available
 yani 8 rupee se 9 rupee kilo ke bhav mil rahe hai
 This is also less, but after a report, how the price has gone from 3 rupees to 9 rupees, we are unable to understand
 kisaan kah rahe the ki pichley saal pakistan niryaat ke kaaran khub bhav mila to is baar zyaada zamin kiraaye par lekar kheti kar lee
 In Amroha district, tomato cultivated in ten thousand bighas
 kai kisaan nuksaan ke kaaran karze main aa gaye hai
 Amroha is not far from Delhi
 vahaan kisaan ko ek kilo tamaato ke 10 rupee bhi nahin mil rahe hai lekin aaj hi dakshin dilli ke katwaria sarai main tamaato kaa bhav 50 rupee kilo tha
 There is a price of 44 rupees kg in the successful
 ab aap hi bataaiye amroha main kisaan ko 3 rupee kilo bhav nahin mil rahe hai, jabaki vah ek kilo tomaamar ugane main 15 rupee laga de rahaa he or dilli main 50 rupee kilo tamaato bik rahaa he
 You are also being plundered and the farmer is also being plundered
 phir yah koun he jo 47 rupee kaa munafa le ja rahaa he

 In Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, farmers have grown tomatoes in ten thousand bighas
 upi main sabase adhik tamaato amroha main hi hota he vaise aam bhi khub hota he
 The farmers here threw the tamaras on the side of the road, because the cost was not available even if they were sold

 There is a price of 44 rupees kg in the successful
 ab aap hi bataaiye amroha main kisaan ko 3 rupee kilo bhav nahin mil rahe hai, jabaki vah ek kilo tomaamar ugane main 15 rupee laga de rahaa he or dilli main 50 rupee kilo tamaato bik rahaa he

 kanpur uniwarsity ke biessi ke teenon saal main kul 1 lakh 28 hazaar chaatr fail hue hai
 Isn't this a serious issue? Now think what is going on in studies that so many students are failing

 Isn't it shameful that India's engineering education is so inferior that 94 per cent of engineers from its colleges are not fit to be hired? kya naujavaanon ke saath dhokhaa nahin ho rahaa he
 Did she study for free? behatar he apane sawaal badal len varanaa halaat nahin badalenge

 Common families are paying twenty-two million fees in private colleges by paying loans and after passing it is heard that 94% of IT engineers are not fit to be hired, then with whom is this cheating? kya yah dakaiti nahin he
 Are parents and students not cheated? kya yah sharmnaak nahin he ki bharat kii ejineering kii shiksha itani ghatiya he ki iske collejon se paas 94 fisadi ejeeniyar naukari par rakhe jane laayak nahin hai
 Are the youth not being deceived? kya usne muft main padhai kii thi
 It is better to change your questions or else the situation will not change

 They demanded that the question papers of the second innings in the first innings of Hindi have been divided, so the examination should be canceled
 ayog ne pariksha radd bhi kar di magar sirf hindi kii
 Students started demanding that the entire exam be canceled, but the commission said that there was such a mess at the same center, so why cancel the rest of the exam

 Trusted batsman Rahul Dravid, known as 'wall', will conclude his ODI international with a one-day match with England in Cardiff on Friday
 dravid kaa prayaas jahaan vyaktigat pradarshan se is match ko yaadgaar bananaa hoga vahiin mahendra singh dhauni bhi chahenge ki yah match jitkar bhartiya team apane is mahaan khilaadi ko acchhee tarah vidaa kare
 Dravid returned to the Indian ODI cricket team after two years in August
 beete dedh dashak se bhartiya team ke abhinn hissaa rahe dravid ne england ke khilaaf khilne ke liye chune jane se pehle apana aakhri ekadivasiy muqabla 30 sitambar, 2009 ko johannesburg main champiens trophy ke dauraan westeindies ke khilaaf khelaa tha
 He was then dropped from the team to give the team a youthful look
 varsh 2007 ke isisi vishwa cap main team kaa netritv karne vaale dravid ko austrailia ke khilaaf ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa main kharaab pradarshan ke baad team se baahar kar diya gaya tha lekin 2009 main unki ek baar phir team main vaapasi hui
 He played in the Champions Trophy
 yah vaapasi sirf chah maichon ke liye rahi
 Dravid was not included in the squad for the ODI series played with South Africa
 tab se hi dravid ko team se baahar rahanaa padaa tha
 In his absence, India won the World Cup and it was certain that his return was impossible now, but the failure of the Indian batsmen on the bouncy pitches of England forced the selectors to trust Dravid
 england ke saath kheli gai chaar maichon kii shrinkhalaa main teen shatak lagane vaale dravid haalanki apane jivan kii antim ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa main balle kaa kamaal nahin dikhaa sake
 Dravid scored two runs in the first match while in the second match, 32 runs came off his bat
 tisare match main ek phir dravid do ran par out ho gaye jabaki chauthe match main vah 19 ran bana sake
 So far, 39 not out 40 times in 317 innings of 343 matches
 06 ke ausat se 10820 ran bana chuke dravid ke liye kisi ek shrinkhalaa main naakaami koi nai baat nahin lekin is mahaan khilaadi ne apane 15 varsh ke kariyar main kai maukon par mushkil se nikalakar team ke liye match jitau paariyaan kheli hai
 Dravid holds several records in odis
 unhone 1999 main hyderabad main sachin tendulkar ke saath milakar newjiland ke khilaaf duusare wicket ke liye 331 ranon kii saajhedaari nibhaai thi, jo ekadivasiy maichon ke lihaaj se aaj bhi ek vishwa ricard he
 Apart from this, Dravid along with Sourav Ganguly added 318 runs for the second wicket against Sri Lanka at Taunton in 1999
 dravid ekadivasiy maichon ke sabase safal ballebaajon main se ek hai
 He is one of the eight batsmen to have scored more than 10,000 runs in odis
 inamen sachin or ganguli bhi shaamil hai

 pentagon ne bhi uttar korea kii ore se shanivaar ko missile pareekshan kiye jane kii pushti kii he
 CNN was quoted by US officials as saying that North Korea launched a mobile medium-range KN-17 ballistic missile that could not reach the Japan Sea

 Indeed, China had asked North Korea to stop the missile test and nuclear program

 His statement is seen as a provocation against North Korea to China
 North Korea disrespected the wishes of China & its highly respected President when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today

 America can do military actions These words of the President of the world's most powerful country, America, cannot be taken lightly
 trump yah bhi saaf kar chuke hai ki uttar korea ke saath bheeshan sangharsh hoga
 In addition, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has also said that the US wants to take military action against North Korea
 aise main uttar korea ke missile pareekshan ke jawaab main america us par sainya karrwai kar saktaa he
 At the same time, North Korea has also warned of nuclear attack on America

 In fact, to fulfill these promises, they will have to pass many big bills quickly
 naidu ko nai rajdhani jane main kaaphi samay lagane vaala he jise vijaywada or guntur ke bich namburu main viksit kiya janaa he
 a week after his swearing-in, on 15 June, state finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu was seen ascending the steep steps to occupy his office in the temporary secretariat in Hyderabad
 iske agle hi ghante soochna praudyogiki mantri pi
 Raghunath Reddy also occupied his office
 rajya sachivalay main naidu mantrimandal ke 19 main se sirf 11 mantriyon ke liye offis ban paaya tha or ek tarah se jagah ko lekar chhina-jhapati chal rahi thi
 The old government offices of the undivided Andhra Pradesh Secretariat and Hyderabad were divided before the state bifurcation date of June 2 to cater to the needs of the two states (telangana and Andhra Pradesh)
 lekin lagata he ki yah bantwaaraa kaaphi avivekpurna tareeke se kiya gaya he
 Both the states have been allotted four blocks in a huge campus in which they have to accommodate all their departments
 afasar offis spes kii chahat or varishthata ko lekar sachet prashasan ke aadesh ke mutabik paryaapt suvidhaayen na hone se aape se baahar hai
 Naidu's sense of leaving Hyderabad as soon as possible is clearly visible
 unhone vidhaayi dal kii baithak 4 june ko tirupati main bulaai, shapath grahan samaaroh 8 june ko vijaywada main hua or mantrimandal kii pehali baithak vishakhapatnam main 12 june ko hui
 To exacerbate the problem, Naidu's architectural expert Chivukula Raghavendra Sarma rejected the Chief Minister's office in the H-block of the secretariat and asked for a more 'favorable' space on the eighth floor of the L-block
 ab el-block main ban rahe siemo main aantarik saaj-sajja par kaam chal rahaa he, lekin ise taiyaar hone main abhi chaar hafte or lag jaaenge
 Naidu will now use the Heritage Lake View Guest House as his camp office and the residence will remain his Jubilee Hill bungalow

 Now there are many Hyderabad
 Naidu, who won 102 out of 175 assembly seats, is well aware that he has increased the aspirations of the people, especially that he will take the right steps
 yah banjaaron jaisi kavayad lagati he ki pehali baar teen mahatvapurn aayojan teen shaharon tirupati, vijaywada or vishakhapatnam main karne pade
 At the end of his first cabinet meeting, Naidu said, “we want to indicate to all the regions that the state will have a balanced and integrated development and we will choose the path of decentralization
 ”rajnatik arthshaastri parakala prabhakar kehete hai, “tarakkee ke pichley model ko chhodia hoga jisamen har cheez hyderabad kendrit ho gai thi
 The challenge will be to implement a decentralization model, dealing with the resistance of political parties and industries, who would like to keep everything in the capital
 ”mukhyamantri ne sabhi adhikariyon se kaha he ki ek puri tarah atyaadhunik prashasnic parisar banaaen jisamen haai-speed network ho or rajya ke nae mukhyalay ke liye buniyadi dhaanche or anya jaruri sajo-saamaan kaa bandobast do maah ke bheetar puraa kiya jaae
 Naidu has also asked his core team to rethink the vision -2020 for Andhra Pradesh, which was prepared during his chief minister's previous term

 Revenue deficit and debt burden are two issues that have to be addressed on priority

 Belongs to hamen anutpaadak kharchon kii pahchaan kerani hogi or jahaan bhi sambhav ho, isamen katautee kerani hogi
 We have to focus on increasing revenue without imposing tax
 ”sarkaar main nakadi sankat ke masale ko to sulajh liya gaya he, percepshan management ke jaankaar naidu yah bataane ke liye kathor prayaas kar rahe hai ki tamaam kamiyon ke baavjood andhra pradesh sambhavit niveshkon ke liye mufeed jagah he
 Its strong bases are gas in the krishna-godavari basin and mineral wealth in the Rayalaseema region
 aisi gahan vikaas ranneeti ke liye nakadi kii tangi kaa saamana kar rahe rajya ko fund kii jarurat hogi, jiske liye use dilli kaa munh dekhnaa hoga
 Naidu's immediate concern is to fulfill the promise of debt waiver of farmers
 anumaan ke mutabik, kul krishi karj maafee se khajaane par kareeb 60,000 karod ru
 Will have to bear the burden of garibon ko pine kaa pani, vidhwaaon kii pension badhaane, sarkari karmchaariyon kii ritairement kii umr badhaane jaise unke duusare vaadon ko puraa karne se bhi sarkari khajaane par baari boj padegaa
 The closure of belt shops (illegal shops of liquor licensed vendors) may also reduce excise revenue
 1994 main vitt mantri ke rup main naidu ne belt shop ko bilkul nazarandaaj kar diya tha or sabsidi yojana ke tahat chaaval kii keemat badhaakar 5 ru
