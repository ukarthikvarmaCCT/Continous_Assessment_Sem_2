sahvaag kii anupasthiti main daire davills kii kaman james hopes ko saunpi gai he
 Dare Devils team coach Greg Shifford has admitted that his team has failed to play as a unit
 greg ne haalanki ummid jataai ki hopes kii captaini main unki team baaki bache muqablon main acha pradarshan karegi
 Greg is also well aware that it is extremely difficult for his team to beat the Super Kings, who have won five consecutive wins on their home ground in the IPL
 super kings team khel ke teenon vibhaag main daire davills se behatar he
 If the Dare Devils beat the Super Kings at Chidambaram Stadium on Thursday, it would be considered a big upset
 iske liye daire davills ko acchhee gendbaaji ke saath-saath umdaa kshetrarakshan karnaa hoga
 After this comes the batting, which looks largely incomplete without Sehwag
 hopes ek anbhavi khilaadi hai or is satr main daire davills ke niyamit sadsy rahe hai
 In such a situation, he has a good knowledge of the shortcomings and strengths of the team
 hopes ko agar kuch khilaadiyon kaa acha saath mila, to vah nishchit taur par chaunkaane vaala parinaam dena chahenge
 On the other hand, the Super Kings team, which had succumbed to the 'ruthlessness' of the duckworth-louis system at the Eden Gardens against Kolkata Knight Riders, have regained the rhythm by beating the Rajasthan Royals in their next match
 super kings ne is satr main sabase acha kshetrarakshan kiya he or iske boote usne ahm ran bachaae hai
 At the same time, his batting and bowling have been excellent
 is lihaaj se daire davills ke liye super kings ko haraakar apni paanchavin jeet darj karne kii raah behad kathin dikh rahi he

 Like a blatant film, security forces were deployed, advisories were issued in the wake of the terror threat, political leaders of the Kashmir Valley were put under house arrest, other communications services including the internet were stopped and there was a lot of heat in the middle of the night
 yah sab july ke antim saptaah main tab shuru hua jab centre ne aatankwaad rodhi abhiyaanon kii majbootee or kanoon vyavastha kii sthiti ke aadhaar par ghati main kendriya ardhsainik balon kii 100 companiyon (kareeb das hajaar kendriya surakshakarmiyon) kii tainaati kaa aadesh diya
 However, the state's political parties and opposition parties expressed concern over the 'intentions' of the central government and claimed that the Center was planning to 'do something big'
 kashmir ghati main chintaa kaa maahaul utpann ho gaya jahaan srinagar ke samvedansheel ilaakon aurkashmir ke anya hisson main atirikt surakshakarmiyon kii tainaati kii gai
 Most of these security personnel were from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF)
 yah tainaati 100 companiyon ke atirikt thi
 The situation reached its peak on Friday when the army said that terrorists in Pakistan were plotting to target the Amarnath pilgrims
 iske saath hi jammu kashmir prashasan ne paraamarsh jari kar tirthayatriyon or paryatakon se tatkaal ghati chhodane ko kaha
 There is speculation that the developments in Kashmir are related to the terrorist threat
 vahiin, anek log anuchhed 35-e or anuchhed 370 par koi badi ghoshnaa hone kii atakalein lagane lage
 Amarnath pilgrims and tourists started leaving the valley on Saturday after consultation with the government
 atakalein tab or bad gayi jab sarkaar ne airlinon se kaha ki ve jammu kashmir se baahar jane vaali udaanon ke kiraye par niyantran rakhen
 At the same time, the Railways announced that it will not charge any fee for cancellation of tickets from passengers going out of Kashmir
 is bich, rajya ke rajyapal ne jammu kashmir ke raajnneetik dalon se kaha ki ve apane samarthakon se shant rahane or ghati main 'ud raheen afvaahon' par vishwaas na karne ko kahen
 Amid growing speculation about Article 35-A and Article 370, regional parties in Jammu and Kashmir took a unanimous resolution on Sunday to fight against any attempt to abolish the provisions giving special status to the state or to divide the state into three parts
 Will fight neshnal conference ke adhyaksh faruk abdulla ne baithak main sweekaar kiya gaya prastaav padhate hue kaha ki dalon ne raashtrapati, pradhanmantri or vibhinn raajnneetik dalon ke netaaon ke paas pratinidhimandal bhejne kaa faisla kiya he jo samvidhan ke anuchhed 35-e tathaa anuchhed 370 ko hataane yaa nirvachan kshetron ke parisemen yaa rajya ko teen hisson main baantne ke kisi bhi prayaas ke dushprinaamon ke bare main avgat karaayenge
 Immediately after the meeting, suspense deepened by the fast-paced developments in the Valley as authorities increased security at key installations and sensitive areas on Sunday night, suspending mobile and internet services and 'arresting' many leaders or ' Taken into custody '
 do purv mukhyamantriyon mahabuuba mufti or umr abdulla ne kaha ki unhen najarband kar diya gaya he
 At the same time, Congress leader Usman Majid and CPI (M) leader Tarigami claimed that he was arrested around midnight
 raat main gahraae rahasy ke baad somvaar kii subah kendriya cabinet kii baithak hui
 However, the details of what was discussed in the meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi were not disclosed
 baithak ke tatkaal baad kendriya grih mantralay ne sandesh diya ki grih mantri amit shah sansad main bayaan denge
 This led to the news of any major announcement about Kashmir floating rapidly in the air
 rajyasabha kii baithak shuru hote hi shah ne anuchhed 370 ko khatm karne kii ghoshnaa kii, or is tarah kai dinon se chali aa rahi atakalon, chintaa or rahasy-romaanch par viraam lag gaya

 The scam is worth over 3 crores
 aapako jaanakar hairaani hogi ki share bazaar kii niamak sanstha sebi yani secority exange board of india kii naak ke neeche pichley 5 saalon se thagi kaa ye dhandha chal rahaa tha, wo bhi dabba trading ke jariye
 Dabba Trading is that unique box, which not only turns black money white but also blacks out white money to save tax
 dabba companiyon ke jariye ise anjaam de rahe hai dabba treders
 Clerk companies and Clerk traders are defrauding the government of crores of tax
 bhole-bhaale niveshkon ko thag rahe hai
 Clerk traders do such trading which is not registered on the server of the stock exchange first, even if it is, by fake name

 balki ye dabba treders saudon ko keval apane dabbe main darj karata he or sarvice tex, margin mani or tranjaction fees ko chura letaa he

 loksabhaa chunaav main jeet darj karne ke saath hi kunwar danish ali kaa kad bahujan samaaj party main kaaphi tej se badha rahaa tha
 Mayawati has given Qatar on him even before he could take his political flight
 basapa supremon ne danish ali ko hataakar jonpur se saansad shyaam singh yadav ko loksabhaa main basapa ke sansadeey dal kaa netaa bana diya he
 Please tell that just before the Lok Sabha elections, Danish Ali broke the ties with the JDS and joined the BSP
 iske baad mayawati ne danish ali ko uttar pradesh ke amroha sansadeey seat se pratyaashee banaaya, jahaan se wo jitkar saansad chune gaye
 After this, Mayawati, ignoring her old leaders, selected Danish Ali as the leader of the bsp's parliamentary party in the Lok Sabha
 mayawati ke ek faisle ke baad danish ali kaa kad basapa main kaaphi bad gaya tha
 Danish Ali considered himself equal to BSP general secretary and party leader in Rajya Sabha Satish Chandra Mishra
 yaheen danish ali galati kar baithe
 Moving away from Mayawati's line on important issues like Section 370 and triple talaq, Danish Ali had expressed his opinion, due to which he had to lose his post
 basapa sutron kii maane to teen talaak ke mudde par danish ali ne loksabhaa main party line se alag raay rakhi thi
 He wanted the party to vote against the triple talaq bill, while Mayawati wanted a walkout
 isi matbhed ke chalate danish ali se mayawati naaraaz ho gayi
 Due to this, Mayawati instructed Danish Ali not to speak in the Lok Sabha on the issue of Section 370
 jammu-kashmir se dhara 370 hataane ke mudde par loksabhaa main danish ali kii jagah saansad girish chandra ne baat rakhi
 Girish announced his support by reading Mayawati's thoughts in Parliament instead of expressing her views
 basapa sutron kii maane to anuchhed 370 ke mudde par danish ali virodh karnaa chaahate the
 It is believed that Danish Ali has fallen on these issues
 mayawati ne danish ko sansadeey dal ke netaa pad se hataakar jonpur se saansad shyaam singh yadav ko kaman de di he
 Although Mayawati removed Danish, the BSP loyalist and old leader Munkad Ali has tried to control the damage by making the state president
 basapa par najar rakhane vaale syed kasim kehete hai ki basapa ke taur tareeke se danish ali waakif nahin he
 They do not know that only and only Mayawati gives opinion in the BSP, which other leaders of the party only have to implement
 is baat ko danish ali samaj nahin sake
 That is why he has been discharged from his post within two months

 On 15 February 2019, after the right-wing group protested in front of Alpine College demanding that all its 300 Kashmiri students be expelled, Chauhan issued a separate declaration that any new Kashmiri students in the new session Will not be granted entry
 vahiin santhaan ke adhyaksh anil saini ne kaha ki "hamane kashmiri chaatro ko santhaan main (dakshinpanthi samoohon se) surakshit rakhane kaa faisla kiya he
 In addition, we will follow whatever orders are issued by the state government regarding granting admission to Kashmiri students ”

 Voting will be held on April 23 in Jhanjharpur, Supaul, Araria, Madhepura and Khagaria seats in the third phase of Lok Sabha elections
 bihar kii ye paanchon siten simanchal, kosi or mithlanchal ilaake se judi hui hai
 In the Modi wave in 2014, the BJP was left out of lotus feeding in this area
 haalanki is baar jediu ke endie main entry ke baad raajnneetik sameekaran badale hue najar aa rahe hai
 In this way, the fight between Mahagathbandhan and NDA is being seen as a thorn contest
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi in paanch main se mahaj ek seat hi jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 Apart from this, one seat was given to bjp's ally LJP
 jabaki argedy ko do or ek seat par congress ne jeet darj kii thi
 In this Lok Sabha elections, JDU is contesting on three seats, LJP one and BJP one seat from AADA in these five seats
 vahiin, mahagathbandhan kii ore se argedy teen, congress ek or vikasshil insaan party ek seat par chunavi maidan main
 At the same stage, the fate of Sharad Yadav, who revolted from JDU, is also at stake
 supaulabihar ke kosi ilaake kii supaul loksabhaa seat par mahagathbandhan kii ore se congress kii ranjit ranjan kaa sidhaa muqabla jediu ke dileshwar kamait se he
 Despite the Modi wave in 2014, Ranjita Ranjan managed to win
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav jaisi siyaasi ladaai is baar bhi najar aa rahi he
 However, in this year's political struggle, BJP-JDU is together in the election field, which has made the contest interesting
 is tarah se ranjita ranjan ko ek baar phir kadi chunauti milti najar aa rahi he
 Supaul Lok Sabha seat came into existence in 2008 and JDU had already won the elections, but in 2014 Ranjita Ranjan avenged her defeat
 jhanjharpurbihar ke mithlanchal ilaake main aane vaali jhanjharpur loksabhaa seat par jediu se ramprit mandal or argedy se gulab yadav siyaasi sangram main he
 The BJP won in 2014, but under the alliance, this seat has gone to jdu's account
 aise main seat ko bachaae rakhane kii chunauti ramprit mandal ke kandhon par he
 At the same time, Devendra Prasad Yadav, a five-time MP on this seat, has made the contest triangular by going down from the Samajwadi Janata Dal (democrat)
 haalanki devendra yadav yahaan se argedy or jediu donon partiyon se jeet darj kar chuke hai
 In such a situation, political equations of both parties are seen to be deteriorating due to Devendra Yadav's entry into the battle
 dilachasp baat ye he ki bijepi pehali baar 2014 main modi lahar main is seat par jeet darj karne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 At the same time, RJD is hoping to return to this seat
 arrisimanchal kshetra main aane vaali arriya loksabhaa seat par argedy se ek baar phir sarfaraj alam chunavi maidan main pita taslimuddin kii viraasat ko bachaae rakhane ke liye utre hai
 At the same time, BJP has once again placed a bet on Pradeep Kumar Singh
 arriya simanchal kshetra kaa hissaa he or yah kshetra muslim bahul he
 More than 45 percent of Muslim and Yadav voters are here
 muslim or yadav voton ke sameekaran se yahaan argedy ke taslimuddin ne 2014 main jeet hasil kii thi, lekin unka bich kaarykaal main hi nidhan ho gaya
 In the subsequent by-elections, Sarfaraz Alam went to the electoral fray from the RJD and defeated Pradeep Singh to become an MP
 is baar phir donon netaa aamane-saamne hai
 There is a political contest between three Yadav leaders in Madhepura Lok Sabha seat of Madhepurakosi area
 is seat par mahagathbandhan kii or se argedy ke sharad yadav, endie kii or se jediu ke dinesh chandra yadav or jan adhikaar party se rajesh ranjan urf pappu yadav sahit 13 ummidavaar chunavi maidan main hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP could not win this seat in the Modi wave
 pappu yadav ne sharad yadav ko maat di thi
 The maximum Yadav caste voters in Madhepura are around three and a half lakh, about two lakh Muslim voters
 brahman, rajput, musahar or dalit matadaata bhi ek-ek lakh ke kareeb he
 Apart from this, a large population of Pachpania community plays a decisive role in this seat
 yahaan teenon pratyaashee yadav maton ko lekar rassakashi kar rahe hai
 Pappu Yadav is engaged to connect people of every community from here
 khagadiyamithlanchal kii khagadiya loksabhaa seat par is baar mahagathbandhan main shaamil vikasshil insaan party ke mukesh saahani chunavi maidan main utre hai
 At the same time, Chaudhary Mehboob Ali Kaiser of LJP is from the NDA
 is tarah se donon netaaon ke bich sidhi ladaai maani ja rahi he
 Mukesh Sahni is the famous set designer of Bollywood and has a major presence in the politics of Nishads

 The comments ahamed ne spasht kiya ki ‘anti romeo skhwaid’ keval aise vyaktiyon ke virudgh kaary karegaa, jo raah chalate balikaon or mahilaon ko kisi bhi prakaar se pareshaan karte hai
 In any case, it will not take action against such couples or individuals who, while being within the ambit of social traditions, are mingling with each other in parks, malls, coffee houses, cinemas etc
 ahamed ne kaha ki pashu taskari, govadh ke prati ‘jiro tolerance’ kii niti apanaayi jaye or kisi bhi dasha main aise kaaryon main lipt vyaktiyon ko apane mansoobon main safal na hone diya jaae
 He has also given instructions to top officials that discipline and turnout of policemen should be kept good
 ‘‘praaia: yah dekha ja rahaa he ki katipay kaarnon se kuch samay se anushaasan ke upar dhyaan nahin diya ja rahaa he
 Policemen on duty are not wearing the correct uniform, the uniform is not clean, the cap is not on the head and the shoes are not of the prescribed style
 ’’ ahamed ne kaha, ‘‘dauty par karyrat karmi chauraahon par akhbaar padhate huye, baatcheet karte huye yaa mobile phone par vaarta karte huye dikh jate hai or unhen kisi bhi str se na to tokaa jaataa he or na sahi prakaar se duty dene athwa vardi dhaaran karne ke liye nirdesh diye jate hai
 It is a part of duty to be vigilant while wearing the right uniform at the time of duty and keep a close watch on the activities at and around your duty place
 ’’ unhone kaha ki prayek pulicekarmi ko evam piesi ke karmchaariyon ko is sambandh main har str par baithak karke nirdesh de diye jaaen jisase saikadon kii sankhya main tainaat police karmi maatr bhautik rup se upasthit hi na rahen balki maansik rup se apni duty ke sthaan par satarkta ke saath maujuud rahen or apane uttardayitvon kaa sahi nirvahan kar saken
 Ahmed clarified that the 'anti Romeo Squad' will only work against such individuals who harass girls and women in any way on the way
 yah kisi bhi dasha main aise jodon yaa vyaktiyon ke virudgh kaarywahi nahin karegaa, jo saamaajik paramparaon ke daayre main rahete hue aapas main park, mal, kaaphi house, cinemaghar aadi main mil-jul rahe hon
 Ahmad said that the policy of 'zero tolerance' towards cattle trafficking, cow slaughter should be adopted and in any case, people involved in such activities should not be allowed to succeed in their plans
 unhone aalaa adhikariyon ko ye nirdesh bhi diye hai ki pulicekarmiyon kaa anushaasan va turnout acha rakhaa jaae
 "it is often seen that due to some reasons, discipline has not been given due attention for some time
 duty par karyrat pulicekarmi sahi vardi nahin pahan rahe hai, vardi saaf-suthri nahin he, topi sir par nahin he evam juute nirdhaarit style ke nahin hai
 "the personnel working on duty are seen reading the newspapers at intersections, talking or talking on mobile phones, and they are neither restrained from any level nor given duty properly or Instructions are given for wearing uniforms
 duty ke samay sahi vardi dhaaran karte huye satark rahanaa evam apane duty sthaan par evam aas-paas kii gatividhiyon par paini najar rakhana duty kaa hissaa he
 He said that instructions should be given to every policeman and employees of PAC after meeting at every level in this regard, so that hundreds of police personnel are not only physically present but mentally in their place of duty Be present with vigilance and discharge your responsibilities properly
 ahamed ne kaha ki pashu taskari, govadh ke prati ‘jiro tolerance’ kii niti apanaayi jaye or kisi bhi dasha main aise kaaryon main lipt vyaktiyon ko apane mansoobon main safal na hone diya jaae
 He has also given instructions to top officials that discipline and turnout of policemen should be kept good

 There have been reports of ambush on a police team in Manipur
 taaja jaankaree ke anusaar is hamale main 2 police karmi shahid ho gaye hai jabaki 6 ghayal bataae ja rahe hai

 rape ke aaropee chinmayanand kii giraftaar ke baad congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ne ek baar phir nishaanaa saadhaa he unhone twitor par likhaa ki bijepi sarkaar kii chamadi itani moti he ki jab tak peedita ko ye na kahana pade ki main aatmadah kar luungi, tab tak sarkaar koi acshan nahin leti
 It was the strength of public and journalism that SIT had to arrest BJP leader Chinmayanand
 janata ne sunishchit kiya ki beti bachaao keval naaron main na rahe balki dharaatal par utre
 Priyanka has been more vocal about this matter than the leader of any opposition
 vah chinmayanand kii giraftaar kii lagaataar maang kar rahi thim
 Earlier, he wrote on social media, 'the fate of the BJP government and police negligence and protection to the accused in Unnao rape case is in front of everyone
 ab bijepi sarkaar or uttar pradesh police shahjahanpur maamle main vahi duhara rahi he
 The victim is in fear but the BJP government does not know what is waiting
 'bhaajapa sarkaar kii chamadi itani moti he ki jab tak peedita ko ye na kahana pade ki main aatmadah kar loongi, tab tak sarkaar koi ection nahin leti
 It was the power of public and journalism that SIT had to arrest BJP leader # Chinmayanand
 vahiin is maamle main unhone police kii bhoomika par bhi sawaal uthaae
 He said that the BJP government of Uttar Pradesh has made it clear that it has nothing to do with women's safety
 aakhir kyon shikayatakarta ladki ko dobaaraa press ke saamne suraksha kii guhaar lagaani pad rahi he? aakhir upi police sust kyon he? kyonki aaropee kaa sambandh bhaajapa se he?janata ne sunishchit kiya ki beti bachaao keval naaron main na rahe balki dharaatal par utre
 Significantly, BJP leader Chinmayanand was arrested by the UP SIT on Friday for raping a law student
 chinmayanand (chinmayanand) ko medical pareekshan ke liye aspataal le jaaya gaya tha
 Around 8 in the morning
 50 minute par giraftaar kiya
 After that Chinmayanand was produced in the court and then sent to jail for 14 days by the court
 udhar, chinmayanand kii ore se daayar jabaran vasuuli ke maamle main police ne teen logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 The preparations for the Lok Sabha elections in the country have started on a war footing by political parties and a streak has been drawn for the fight as it happens in the battlefield
 
 
 donon taraf gathbandhan karne kii hode si lagi hui he
 The parties are talking among themselves after taking stock of the damage caused by each party and state by state
 ab ise aap mahagathbandhan kahen yaa mahamilawat magar sachai to yahi he ki yah mahamilawat har jagah maujuud he or aaj kii raajnneeti kii yahi sachai he
 The BJP has also finalized an alliance with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and made a joint declaration
 yah tay hua he ki bijepi or shivasena saath milakar loksabhaa or vidhansabha kaa chunaav ladenge
 Of the total 48 seats in the Lok Sabha, BJP will contest 25 and Shiv Sena on 23 seats
 jabaki vidhansabha main is gathbandhan kii sahyogi partiyon kii siton ko chhodkar baaki bachi siton par bijepi or shivasena baraabar siton par ladengi
 Similarly, in Tamil Nadu, BJP is also going to tie up with AIADMK
 maujuuda loksabhaa main tamilnadu kii 39 siton main se 37 par ediemke kaa kabja he to ek seat piemke or ek seat bijepi ke paas he
 In Tamil Nadu AIADMK has announced its alliance with PMK according to which AIADMK has given 7 Lok Sabha seats to PMK
 saath hi piemke ko ek rajyasabha seat bhi di jaaegi, magar uske evaj main piemke 21 vidhansabha siton par hone vaale upachunaav main ediemke ko apana sarmathan degi
 AIADMK is also going to give seat to BJP from its share
 tamilnadu main bijepi ke liye seat utani mahatvarpun nahin he, balki gathbandhan kaa hissaa bananaa zyada myne rakhata he
 Now let's look at the alliance with the BJP or say the Great Depression
 uske do sthai sahyogi to hai hin jaise punjab main akali dal, maharashtra main shivasena, bihar main janata dal united or ramvilas paswan kii loktantric janata party
 Not only this, BJP also has an alliance with smaller parties like Apna Dal in Uttar Pradesh
 assam main assam gana parishad bijepi kaa saath chhod chuki he magar use manaane kii koshishen jari hai
 Andhra Pradesh has 20 Lok Sabha seats, of which BJP has only two seats, but Chandrababu Naidu's alliance with Telugu Desam
 magar jagan mohan reddy kii wiesar congress ek badi takat ke rup main ubhar rahi he
 However, it has only three seats in the current Lok Sabha
 magar uski ubhartee takat ko dekhte hue bijepi jagan mohan reddy se haath milaanaa chaahegi
 Jagan also has the BJP as the only option as he can neither go with the Congress nor with Chandrababu's TDP
 duusari taraf telugana kii 15 loksabhaa siton main se bijepi ke paas keval ek seat he or jagan mohan reddy ke paas bhi ek hi seat he
 The BJP also has the option of going with Chandrashekhar Rao's TRS as well as Jagan Mohan
 iske alaava bijepi kii mahamilawat uttar purv ke kai rajyon main bhi jari he
 Now, let's talk about the grand alliance or the great alliance of the opposition
 congress ne bihar main argedy, kushvaha, maanjhi jaise logon ke ek saath ek bada kunba jod rakhaa he to jharkhand main vah jharkhand mukti morcha ke saath he
 In Tamil Nadu, the Congress DMK is going to join hands with AIADMK PMK and BJP, which may include some more parties
 maharashtra main bhi congrel ensipi ke saath to karnataka main vah jedies ke saath milakar ladegi
 Congress is with its oldest ally Muslim League in Kerala but it is not sure whether there will be an alliance in Delhi and West Bengal
 ye to baat ho gai congress kii mahamilawat kii magar ek mahamilawat or bhi he jisase ho saktaa he bijepi ko sabase zyada nuksaan ho
 That is the alliance of SP and BSP in Uttar Pradesh
 yani yah to pakkaa he ki bharat main mahamilawat kaa jor he or jarurat bhi, bhale hi aapke liye yah mahamilawat vichaardhaaraon kaa sangam ho or dusron ke liye avasarvadita
 
 magar kya karen aap kuch bhi kahen bhartiya raajnneeti main mahamilawat kaa hi he jamaana

 From the perspective of Narendra Modi, what is the choice before the voters in the upcoming elections: Do you want a 'forced' government or a 'strong' government? The Prime Minister spoke in the same tone and posture in the speech on the annual Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in Varanasi on 22 January
 haalanki vahaan kareeb 25,000 pravasi bhartiya (enarai) rahe honge, jo kul matadaataaon kaa behad maamuli hissaa he
 The time has come for Modi to give an account of his actions and it is coming to know that it is going to be a much tougher competition than his party's expectations
 mahaj dedh saal pehle unka dobaaraa pradhanmantri bananaa lagbhag tay mana ja rahaa tha
 Now it is no longer as sure
 modi jaanate hai ki harek vot kii ahmiyat he
 These include NRI votes (in addition to the amount of donations they can give to the party)
 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) 2014 kii tarah apane dam par bahumat hasil karne kii kamyaabi dohraane kii baat to bhul hi jaae, yah bhi pakkaa nahin he ki bhaajapa kii aguai vaala rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) sansad main 272 siton kaa aankada paar kar paaegaa
 This is a surprising result of the India today-karvy Insights 'desire of the Nation' poll conducted twice a year between 28 December 2018 and 8 January 2019
 yah surveykshan isliye ahm he kyonki yah aam chunaav ke mushkil se chaar maheene pehle kiya gaya he
 And also because this is the first time since Modi came to power in May 2014 that the 'country mood' survey has predicted the NDA not to cross the majority mark
 yah uske jansamarthan ke girte rujhaan kii tasdik karata he, jaisaa ki pichley do saalon main survey ne darj kiya he ki endie or bhaajapa lagaataar apni jameen khote ja rahe hai
 The January 2019 Scooby's survey shows that if elections are held today, the nda's 100 seats will be reduced — that is, its number of seats will come down to 237 from the 336 seats it won in the 2014 election, 35 less than the majority
 gathbandhan main bhaajapa sabase zyada 80 siten ganvaane vaali party hogi or uski siten 2014 kii 282 siton se ghatakar 202 rah jaaengi
 If this happens, the NDA will have to find other partners to garner a majority and there can be doubts about Modi emerging as the unanimous candidate to lead a coalition government
 vipaksh jahaan is baat par khushi manaa saktaa he ki usne endie or modi ko patkani de di he, vahiin survey yah bhi bataata he ki congress kii aguai vaala sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (upie) yaa koi bhi doosraa vipakshi gathbandhan apane dam par sarkaar banane kii haalat main nahin hoga
 According to the survey, the increase in the seats of the UPA is possible three times - it means that its seats can increase to 166 from 59 in 2014
 tab bhi uske paas bahumat se 106 siten kam hongi
 The remaining 140 seats will go to other opposition parties, including Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and a dozen other parties
 iskaa matlab yah bhi he ki agar gathbandhan kii bhagidaar partiyaan bade paimaane par paala nahin badalati hai, to 2019 ke aam chunaav se vaaki trishanku sansad hi saamne aegi
 Such a fragmented or divided mandate, and the political uncertainty that surrounds it, can be unsettling for many voters
 yahi vajah he ki modi or bhaajapa yah baat matadaataaon ke gale utaarne kii koshish karte rahe hai ki ve unhen puraa bahumat den, varna ve aagaah karte hai ki desh afra-tafari ke daldal main dhans saktaa he
 Senior leader Arun Jaitley wrote the exact same thing in his blog: "it's Modi versus impractical and inoperable short-term alliances
" yaa yah modi banaam afra-tafari he
 "the Prime Minister even went a step ahead of Jaitley and said that before taking over his command, it was the mixed governments of the last 30 years that stalled the development of the country, spread corruption in a tizzy and devastated the nation
 -removed
 congress ne jawaab main modi par tanj kasate hue kaha ki ve bhaajapa ke iken or 1998 se 2004 tak gathbandhan sarkaar kii aguai karne vaale atal bihari vaajapeyi ke kaam kii hi khilli uda rahe hai
 The party also claimed that Congress governments had initiated far-reaching economic reforms during the coalition era and the country had recorded the highest economic growth rate
 survey ke duusare nattejey bhi pradhanmantri ke liye itane hi pareshaan karne vaale ho sakate hai
 While Modi's own personal popularity has remained at a height of 46 per cent, it has come down from the peak of 65 per cent of the January 2017 survey
 isi dauraan congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii lokapriyata 10 fisadi se chalaang lagaakar 34 fisadi par pahunch gai he
 The difference between the two is still 12 percentage points, but the distance that Rahul has covered in the last two years is really worth it
 jahaan tak pradhanmantri ke taur par modi ke kaamkaaj kii baat he, to 54 fisadi log ise acha se lekar asaadhaaran tak maanate hai
 It fell by 7 per cent over the previous year, yet it is a strong figure that reflects Modi's hard work
 is mukaam par endie kii is niraashajanak phislan kii kya vajahen hai? ek baat to yah he ki survey sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ke bare main kul milakar logon kii dharna main giravat bataata he
 In January 2017, the number of people who considered it satisfactory was at the peak of 71%, in our latest survey it has come down to 54%
 haalanki modi ab bhi nikharkar aate hai, jab 34 fisadi uttardaata kehete hai ki bhrashtachar mukt sarkaar chalaanaa or kaale dhan ke khilaaf kadi karrwai karnaa unki sabase badi uplabdhiyaan hai
 Both of these are rated higher than the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (12 per cent) and improving infrastructure (11 per cent)
 alabatta 'desh kaa mizaaj' survey main chunavi nateezon ko tay karne vaali do or badi baaten modi sarkaar kii sabase badi naakaamiyon ke taur par darj hui hai—naukariyon kii kami or jaruri chizon kii keemton main badhotaree
 What should be even more worrying for the Prime Minister is that the number of people who have described the lack of jobs as their worst failure has increased very fast during the last year
 janvari 2018 ke 'desh kaa mizaaj' survey ke 22 fisadi se badhkar ab yah 34 fisadi ho gai he
 He has got some relief in case of increase in prices
 aankade isi avadhi main 23 fisadi se 20 fisadi kii giravat kaa rujhaan dikhaate hai, jo ishaara he ki tel kii keemton main haal main ai giravat kaa kuch asar padaa he
 But inflation still remains the second major concern of the voters
 pradhanmantri ke liye pareshaaniyon kii tikdi banane vaali baat yah he ki kisaanon kii khudakushi ke saath krishi sankat unki naakaamiyon kii fehrist main zyada pramukhataa se saamne aayaa he
 Of the many schemes that Modi has launched since becoming Prime Minister, only two of them appear to leave a strong impression on the people involved in the survey: Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (giving LPG connection) and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (construction of toilets)
 donon yojanaon ko badi sankhya main mahilaon ne saraahaa he
 It is also pleasing that the government was praised for its initiative to provide clean drinking water, roads and electricity
 modi kii kuch or badi pahalon ko alabatta dhakka sahanaa padaa he
 Demonetisation was seen by voters with a good view during its announcement in November 2016
 lekin tab se aisa maanane waalon kii taadaad ki isane chote kaarobaaron ko barbaad kar diya, isaki vajah se naukariyaan chali gayi or kisaanon kii haalat par bura asar daalaa, badhkar 72 fisadi ke bahut zyada oonche aankade par pahunch gai he
 These are huge vote banks and this is also one of the reasons for the significant decline in the number of seats in the NDA recorded in the last two years 'mood of the country' survey
 jahaan tak aarthik morche par pradarshan kii baat he, to aadhe log maanate hai ki modi sarkaar ne congress ke mukaable behatar kaam kiya he
 Only 40 percent believe that his economic status has improved during Modi's tenure
 achche dinon ke modi ke vaade ke maamle main 63 fisadi maanate hai ki ve vaada puraa karne main naakaam rahe hai
 So is this a sign of ups and downs for Modi, BJP and NDA
 chah maheene main ek baar hone vaala hamaara 'desh kaa mizaaj' surveykshan ek nishchit samay main desh ke matadaataaon kii raay ko pratibimbit karata he
 Modi and NDA constituents still have some options left in the remaining months so that they can retain their majority in the upcoming Lok Sabha
 taaja surveykshan main endie ko bahumat paane ke liye 32 siten kam pad rahi hai, isliye use nai partiyon se chunaav-purv gathbandhan bananaa chahie, jaise tamilnadu (jahaan 39 siten hai) main eiediemke or andhra pradesh (25 siten) main tidipi kii jagah viesar congress ko apane saath laana chahie
 Meanwhile neutral leaders — Biju Janata Dal Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik in Odisha (21 seats) and Chief Minister of Telangana Rashtra Samithi in Telangana (17 seats)
 chandrashekhar raav—se achche sambandh banaakar rakhana chahie or chunaav baad unke saath gathjod banane kii baatcheet chalaani chahie
 Apart from this, the BJP should make every effort to keep the Shiv Sena in its fold in Maharashtra (48 seats), which are angry with its allies
 endie ke paas chunavi shastraagaar main ek anya bada hathiyaar khud modi hai
 Not only does his popularity remain intact, but he also has the full ability to communicate and influence the message to the voters
 pradhanmantri congress or nehru-gandhi parivaar par lagaataar hamale karte rahete hai or pehle kii sarkaron par sankat ke samay unke kaam karne ke tareekon ko lekar kataaksh karte rahete hai
 But now the time has come for them to go back to the past and proclaim their work and also tell people what they are going to do for them if the public gives them a chance again for the next five years
 vikaas ke mudde par unhone pramukh muddon par vishesh rup se jor diya he, khaskar makaan, shauchalay, rasoi gas, bijli or sadak uplabdh karana
 He has also made several efforts to remove minor flaws and reduce corruption
 pehali baar vot dene vaale matadaataaon main aise logon kii sankhya kaaphi he jo ab bhi yah maanate hai ki modi ne vikaas kaa kaam kiya he
 Rahul Gandhi will have to break this belief of the people
 modi ne khud ko abhi tak ayodhya yaa gohatya rokane ke andolan jaise muddon par jor nahin diya he
 Most worrying for Modi and NDA is widespread discontent among farmers, rural troubles and rising unemployment
 upie or duusare vipakshi partner in teen bade muddon par apana hamalaa tej karne ja rahe hai
 Modi may distribute some lollipops to these sections in his budget, but he has no time left to do more than this
 agar rahul gandhi or unki party reating main upar gaye hai to isaki vajah yah he ki unhone in muddon par logon kii raay ko safaltaapurvak golband kiya he
 The recent successes in the assembly elections in the Hindi heartland states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are an indication that Rahul has been successful in attracting people to his side
 lekin congress adhyaksh keval modi ke kaamkaaj kii aalochana karne bhar se jeet nahin hasil kar paaenge
 They will also need to explain what are their plans to keep the country on the path of development apart from maintaining peace and harmony
 hamaara surveykshan dikhaata he ki 2019 kaa chunaav nateeja kisi ke bhi paksh main ja saktaa he, isliye sabhi bade khiladinnon ke liye yah behad kathin chunaav sabit hone vaala he
 The one who shows passion will win

 (agency input ke saath) Hazrat! Hazrat! Hazrat! 'kanpura', the new song from Anurag Kashyap's upcoming film 'katiyabaz' for cinematic music lovers
 
 
 ' apane puure shabaab ke saath utyub par haal hi relies kiya gaya he
 The film is being built on power theft in Kanpur, so many times in the song, the tempo of the music is interrupted due to lightning, but the style of Indian Ocean's Rahul Ram and Amit Killam will take the song through your ears, It is almost certain

 Let the ball come to bat
 timming paao
 Runs will also be scored later
 rohit ne isi ranneeti ko sahi sabit kiya
 Stopping after completing a century, after completing the impossible, it is as if a huge burden has come off the shoulder of Rohit Sharma
 unhone 100 gendon main apana saikadaa puraa kiya
 Again on this pretext, they staked a claim for the opening
 par iske baad maano vah kahar kii tarah barpe
 Rohit completed the first fifty runs in 72 balls, second 28 balls, third 25 balls, fourth 26 balls and fifth in just 15 balls
 unhone apni pari ke aakhri 73 gendon main 164 ran jutaaye
 If you get a life, take advantage of it, for any bowler in the ODI there are 60 chances to take a wicket but only one ball for the batsman to be out
 aise main agar aapako jeevandaan mil jaae to uskaa phayda jarur uthaanaa chahie
 Rohit Sharma did something similar
 rohit ne maatr 4 ran ke nijee score par ek galat shot khelaa tha par kismat unke saath thi
 His catch was dropped by Tishara Perera on Thirdman and now the result is in front of everyone
 pehle gendbaaj ko parakho phir tut padorohit ne apni is pari main srilanka ke har gendbaaj kii khabar lee
 But initially Rohit tested them first
 virdohi team kii har ranneeti ko bhampa
 When fully understood that there is no longer any danger, then the opponent breaks down on the bowler
 jab ajanta mendis apana pehla over daalane aae the to unhen sirf teen single liya
 But after settling down at the crease, he took the news of Mendis in every over
 partnership ke jariye lakshya paorohit sharma ne is pari main partnership banane par jod diya
 For the first third wicket partnership of 202 runs with Virat Kohli and 128 runs with Robin Uthappa for the fifth wicket
 agar aap acha khel rahe ho to pari ko ant tak le jaorohit sharma ne pari ke baad die intervyuu main kaha, 'maine pehali hi tay kar liya tha ki lambii pari khelni he
 The wicket was good for batting
 300-350 ranon ke lakshya kaa aasaani se peechha kiya ja saktaa he
 So i wanted to stay at the crease for the maximum time
 ' hua bhi aisa hi
 Rohit played from the first over of the match to the last ball of the Indian innings
 ise kehete hai maukey par chaukarohit ne is pari ke saath world cap team main apni jagah pakki kar lee he
 Apart from this, the claim for opening position in odis has also been strengthened
 yani jab mauka mili use bhunaane se chuko mat
 Fours are scored not just by sixes, but when Rohit Sharma scored a double hundred last time, then about 100 runs were scored in it
 lekin is pari main unhone chaukon par zyada dhyaan lagaaya
 33 fours and just 9 sixes in an innings of 264 runs
 personal milastone se zyada team ke score par dhyanarohit sharma ne yah record kaise banaaya, is par kuch bhi likhnaa bemaani he
 His focus was on the team's score
 shaayad yahi vajah rahi ki rohit ne ek baar bhi dohare shatak kaa dabaav mahasoos nahin kiya
 He also said this in his interview

 In response, Yeddyurappa wrote, "we provide full support for the festival and the police will work to provide security
" ab bakreed ke maukey par police suraksha muhaiyaa karai jaaegi
 Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa's government fell prey to criticism of the opposition as soon as he took power in Karnataka
 yediurppa ne karnataka sarkaar ke kannada or samskruti vibhaag ko tipu sultan jayanti na manaane kaa aadesh jari kiya tha
 This was taken during the cabinet meeting

 bataa den ki rajya main tipu jayanti kaa mudda pehle se garam rahaa he or bijepi aksar iskaa virodh karti rahi he
 The birth anniversary of 18th century Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan is celebrated on 10 November every year, but now when the BJP government comes to the state, it has been decided to stop it
 pichley saal bhi congress-jedies sarkaar ke dauraan is jayanti ko dhoomdhaam se manaaya gaya tha
 Congress leader Siddaramaiah had also participated in the program in many places and he also targeted the Bharatiya Janata Party

 Even after the Tendupatta scam was exposed in the Forest Department of Chhattisgarh, the government did not consider it appropriate to investigate the matter
 kaaran vibhaag ke kai bade afasaron se lekar ek nami giraami mantri bhi is maamle main katghare main khadaa tha
 Therefore, due to the fear of slander, the government has exposed the scam of more than 300 crores
 lekin ab is maamle main chhattisgarh hoicourt ne sangyaan lekar sarkaar ko notice jari kar diya he
 The Bilaspur High Court has sought a reply from the Chhattisgarh government on a petition alleging a breach in the Tendupatta contract
 yachikakarta ne adaalat ko dastavej saunpkar ghotaale kaa pardaafash kiya he
 It tells how the officers gave contracts of a politician at the behest of a politician to his people at half the price of the original
 isse sarkaar ko teen sau karod se zyada kaa nuksaan hua he
 The petitioner has demanded a CBI inquiry into the case from the court
 adaalat main pesh kiye gaye tamaam dastavej RTI ke tahat muhaiyaa hue hai
 It has recorded the complete meaning of the scam
 varsh 2015-16 main van samiti dhunura main rupye 9489 prati maanak bora tendupatta kii dar thi, lekin is baar varsh 2017 -18 main aadhi keemat rupye 4594 prati maanak bora kii dar se tendupatta kuch chuninda thekedaaron ko uplabdh kara die gaye
 Similarly the rate in Ambikapur forest division was Rs 6109 per standard bag, which became available in 3809 this time
 korba main rupye 7000 prati maanak bora tha, lekin ise bhi ghataakar aadha kiya gaya or rupye 3939 prati maanak bora ke dar se uplabdh karaayaa gaya
 This scam has taken place in all the districts of the state
 tendupatta ke tamaam theke chhattisgarh laghuvanopaj vyapaar kooparative samiti ne baqayada tender jari kar kuch chuninda thekedaaron ko phayda pahunchaaya
 Half the price of tendu leaves was reduced for some reason
 bataaya jaataa he ki is bandarbaat kii sajeesh afasaron ne rachi
 It is a matter of surprise that the state forest minister Mahesh Gagda has approved the decision to reduce the rate of tendu patta to half
 haalanki, mantri ji is maamle par baatcheet ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 According to the petitioner Santkumar Netam, it has been organized in the forest department
 unke mutabik 300 karod se zyada kii rakam yadi sarkari tijori main aati to jangalon main rahane vaale wo adivasee jo tendupatta todakar van samitiyon ko muhaiyaa karaate hai, unhen phayda hota
 After the primary hearing of the case, the Division Bench of the Chief Justice of the High Court issued notice to the Government of Chhattisgarh and the Forest Department seeking a reply within a week
 maamle kii agali sunwaayee 21 march ko hogi
 Over ten thousand crore tendu leaves are traded in Chhattisgarh annually

 12:03 AM kabddi world cap ke final main pahunchaa bharat, aaj iran se hoga muqabla12:01 AM PM modi 30 oktober ko radio par karenge 'man kii baat' It is said that love is not done but becomes
 lekin ek baat to manani hi padegi ki pyaar main padana jitna aasaan hota he use nibhaana utana hi mushkil kaam he
 That is, it is easy to fall in love or be attracted to someone, but many times people make the mistake of accepting this attraction as love
 asal main kisi ke prati aakarshan kuch din kii khumaari hoti he or phir samay ke saath ye ‘bukhaar’ sir se utar jaataa he
 But real love deepens with time and love falls into life as a springtime
 kisi romantic film dekhne ke baad yaa koi novel padhane ke baad uske kairactors ke ird-gird khud ko mahasoos karnaa acha jarur lagata he, lekin asal jindagi main rishte nibhaana itnaa bhi aasaan nahin hota
 To fall in love, acceptance of two people is necessary 'one you and the other one'
 lekin jab do log ek bandhan main bandhate hai to aakarshan dhire-dhire khatm hone lagata he or yaheen se asli rishte kii shuruyaat hoti he
 In the same way, after irrigating a small plant, it grows and becomes fruitful
 thik usee prakaar rishte ko bhi pyaar se seenchne kii jarurat hoti he
 Love keeps two people not only physical but also with spirit
 ye baat to aap bhi maanenge ki agar kisi rishte ke dhaage man se jude naa hon to phir vah rishta boj ban jaataa he, aise rishton ko nibhaayaa nahin jaataa balki unka bhaar uthaaya jaataa he
 In such a situation, distances of miles begin to be seen between people standing at both ends of the thread of the relationship
 sab kuch baaten:kehete hai pyaar baantne se badhata he
 If the relationship is intimate then there should be no place for you
 aise sambandhon main apni har cheez ek-duusare se saajha karen, phir chaahe wo khushi kaa lamhaa ho yaa gam kaa
 Handsetting in each other's work strengthens the relationship like glue
 mushkil main naa choden saath:pyaar to ek-duusare se bahut karte hai, lekin mushkil main unka saath nahin dete hai to samaj lijie kahin gadabad he
 Love should be such that one gets hurt and pain is on the other
 asli pyaar main vyakti na sirf musiibat main apane saathi kaa saath detaa he, balki use us musiibat se nikaalane kaa bhi har sambhav prayaas karata he
 Talk to each other: If you want the relationship to remain warm, do not ignore each other's small happiness
 rishton main antarangta banaae rakhane ke liye jaruri nahin ki hameshaa shaareerik judaav ke bare main hi sochaa jaae
 To get closer to each other, we should also talk about small things related to each other
 pyaar kaa dhaagaa bahut hi najuk hota he or donon hi ore se ise bachaane kii koshish honi chahie

 The children studying in Jamla Adarsh primary School, Gandhinagar, woke up when they came to know that there was a dead rat in the food for the midday meal
 healthcare se judaa ye course shuru karegi sarkaar, aap bhi rahen taiyarbacchon ko khaanaa parosane ke liye teachers ne jab khaanaa dekhnaa shuru kiya to wo hairaan ho gaye
 Because there was a dead mouse in the food
 gandhinagar ke jamla gaanv main sthit sarkari primary skool main enjio akshay patr dwaara rojaanaa middemil kii supplai kii jaati he
 Know how much IAS exam changed in 5 years 
 
 pitiai kii ek report ke anusaar midday mile ke kamisionar arji trivedi ne bataaya ki skool ko jo khaanaa supplai kiya gaya, usamen mara hua chuha paaya gaya he
 It is a matter of relief that the teachers saw it before the food was served to the children
 arji trivedi ne bataaya ki jamla adarsh primary skool main khaanaa supplai karne vaala saplir teen anya vidyalayon main bhi khaanaa supplai karata he
 But there is no such complaint from there
 hamane jila prashasan se is par report maangi he or ek baar report aane ke baad hi us par faisla liya jayega
 Here is the school of Yogi, commanded by Muslim principal
 
 
 jamla adarsh primary skool main 242 chaatr hai or ise rajya kaa model skool ghoshit kiya gaya he
 Let me tell you that there have been complaints of lizards, cockroaches and dead mice in the midday meal even before this
 goregaanv purv main gater main girakar laapata hua do saal ke divyansh ab bhi laapata he

 But Divyansh's father is not satisfied with this search operation
 pita suraj kaa kahana he ki unki jagah agar kisi viipi kaa baccha hota to puri fouj laga di gai hoti
 The outrage is not just from a loose search operation, but also from the gutter being uncovered
 dukhi pita ne maamle main biemasi ke khilaaf exiaar darj karne kii maang kii he

 arriya se hinsa kii shuruyatdarasal 14 march ko arriya upachunaav main argedy netaa sarfaraj alam kii jeet ke baad sampradayik hinsa kii shuruyaat hui, aarope he ki jeet ke baad vijay juluus ke dauraan bharat virdohi or'pakistan jindabad'ke naare lagaae gaye
 Based on the video, 3 boys were arrested by the police on this charge, after which the case reached another state as well and took the form of mass communal violence
 aaj bihar ke arriya samet 11 jile hinsa kii chapet main hai
 Which includes Bhagalpur, Munger, Aurangabad, Samastipur, Nalanda, Nawada, Jamui, Banka, Muzaffarpur and Sitamarhi
 aage main ham aapke saamne ek aankade rakhane ja rahe hai, jisase se saaf hota he ki is baranithish kumaaraki endie main vaapasi se hinsa ke maamle main zyada saamne aa rahe hai
 Whereas during the previous JDU-BJP government, less than a quarter of the cases were reported from it
 -july 2017 se abtak 270 sampradayik hinsa ke maamle thane main darj chuke hai
 While only 64 cases have been reported in 2018
 -saal 2016 main jediu or argedy kii sarkaar thi, is saal kul 230 sampradayik hinsa hui thim
 Earlier, in 2015, 155 violence reports had reached the police
 is saal bhi jediu, argedy or congress gathbandhan kii sarkaar thi
 In 2014, there were only 110 communal violence cases
 -saal 2013 main nitish kumaar NDA se alag hue the or is saal bihar main kul 112 sampradayik hinsa ke maamle darj hue the
 Earlier, only 50 cases of communal violence were reported in 2012 in 2012 and 25 in 2011 in Bihar
 is dauraan bhi NDA kii sarkaar thi
 - NDA government came to Bihar in 2010 and 50 cases of communal violence were registered this year
 is aankade saaf hota he ki isse pehle nitish or bijepi ke saath aane se bihar main kanoon-vyavastha ke str main sudhaar hua tha
 And there were very few cases of communal violence
 lekin pichhali july se abhi tak jo sampradayik hinsa ke aankade saamne aae hai wo nitish ke sushasan par jarur sawaal uthaata he

 Impacts on the digestive process Cold water impedes the digestion process of your food as it causes blood vessels to shrink
 isse pachan kii prakriya dhimi padane sekhana thik se nahin pachataur hamen iske poshak tatv bhi nahin mil pate
 Heart rate affects: Drinking ice water or strong cold water reduces your heart rate
 adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki thanda pani vegas tantrika ko uttejit karata he
 The vagus nerve is the 10th cranial nerve and is an important part of the body's autonomic nervous system that regulates the body's involuntary functions
 vegas tantrika hriday kii gati ko kam karne main madhyasthata karti he or thanda pani is tantrika ko uttejit karata he jiske kaaran hriday kii gati kam ho jaati he
 The body's energy affects the body's temperature is 37 degrees Celsius and when you drink something cold, your body has to spend some energy to regulate the temperature of that body
 is urja kaa upyog bhojan ke pachan or poshak tatwon ke avasorana ke liye hota he
 This is why drinking cold water does not provide nutrients to your body
 gale ke infections kaa khatrathanda pani pine se sabase zyada prabhavit hamaara galaa hota he or isiilie garmiyon main aksar galaa kharaab hone kii samasya rahati he

 The Congress held a press conference on Tuesday and attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) strongly
 party ke pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne patrakaron ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki chunaav ko prabhavit karne ke liye bijepi historishiter or gundon kaa sahaara le rahi he
 He also said that the party's General Secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad has written a letter to the Election Commission regarding a Haryana case
 press conference main randeep surajevaala ne kaha, 'rohtak main mantri manish grover ne mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ke ishaare par badmaash ramesh lohaar ke saath milakar lagbhag 6 booth par kabja karne kaa prayaas kiya
 On our protest, the rogue blacksmith was arrested and arms were recovered from him
 use haathon haath reeha bhi kar diya or mantri par koi karrwai nahin hui
 Surejwala further said, "there was also a hint of the Prime Minister who had gone to the Rohtak rally on the last day
 rohtak se deependra huda lard rahe hai
 The pm's rally in Rohtak flopped, due to which he scolded Khattar and followed by violence
 in logon ne kai boothon par hinsa kii or votaron ko dhamkaaya
 Even after the information, the Election Commission did not take cognizance
 aaazaad ne ayog ko khat likhaa he
 Regarding Mani Shankar Iyer's comment, Surjewala said, "the Prime Minister also does not keep the language restrained but it does not mean that Congressmen including Mani Shankar Aiyar should also cross the limits of the language
 ye surkhiyaan batorne ke liye aisa karte hai, party isaki kadi ninda karti he
 We condemn those who use such language in our party, including Mani Shankar Aiyar

 exiaar darj kii gai
 The person is in jail
 paryvekshak ne is maamle kii vyaktigat rup se poochtacha kii or santusht hai ki matdaan kabhi bhi prabhavit nahin hua
 "on the other hand, raising the Congress in the dock with Mani Shankar Aiyar's comment on the Prime Minister, the BJP on Tuesday said that the double character and arrogance of the Congress has come to the fore again and it should respond to this
 grih mantri rajnath singh ne bijepi mukhyalay main patrakaron se kaha ki manishankar ayyar ne jo kaha he vah ek website par lekh main kaha he, us par congress kaa kya kahana he? unhone poocha ki ayyar ke bayaan par congress ko kya kahana he? chunaav prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan bhashaa maryaada ke ulanghan par ek sawaal ke jawaab main singh ne kaha ki yah ruknaa chahie, ise roka janaa chahie kyonki kisi bhi jimmedaar netaa ko is prakaar kii baaten nahin kerani chahie
 BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said in his tweet that the 'chief of abusers (abusers in chief)' returned to justify his 'lowly' remarks of 2017
 unhone kaha, ‘ayyar ne tab apni kharaab hindi kaa bahaanaa banaakar maafee maangi thi
 Now they are saying that their assessment was correct
 congress ne pichley saal unke nilamban ko waapas le liya tha
 The Congress's double character and arrogance again surfaced
 ’baharhaal, kai maheenon tak chuppi saadhe rahane ke baad congress netaa manishankar ayyar mangalvaar ko ek baar phir surkhiyon main aa gaye jab unhone apane ek lekh main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf ‘neech’ shabd ke prayog ko uchit tehraaya or sabase kharaab bhashaa prayog karne vaala pradhanmantri bataaya
 In his article, Iyer criticized Modi on several issues and said that remember how i interpreted him on 7 December 2017
 kya meraa akalan sahi nahin tha? 2017 main purv kendriya mantri ne modi ko ‘neech aadmi’ sambodhit kiya tha jiske baad unhen congress party se nilambit kar diya gaya tha

 Earlier, the party had talked about participating in the Karnataka elections
 lekin ovaisi ne party netaaon se charchaa karne ke baad karnataka chunaav nahin ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 Sources said that MIM feels that secular parties may be harmed by their entry in this election
 bataa den ki karnataka ke kuch ilaakon main AIMIM kii pakad kaaphi majboot maani jaati he or isaki kshetreey ikai nechunaav ke maddenjaraummidavaaron kii list bhi taiyaar kar lee thi
 However, AIMIM president and MP from Hyderabad Asaduddin Owaisi consulted party leaders several times on this issue and finally decided not to contest elections
 karnataka kii 224 vidhansabha siton par 12 may ko voting honi he or maton kii gananaa 15 may ko hogi
 The main contest in this election is between Congress, BJP and JDS

 However, the Commission made it clear that the data put on the website is interim and later the final figures will be rectified
 doosraa mudda badi sankhya main iviem ke gaayab hone kaa he
 This information was found under RTI

 Opposition parties demanded a probe through VVPAT of 50 per cent of the votes cast before the election
 jise supreme court ne naamanzoor kar diya tha
 But VVPAT scrutiny of 5 per cent of the votes was allowed
 haalanki isamen yah saaf nahin kiya gaya tha ki agar donon main kaaphi antar ho to kya kiya jayega
 According to an article published in India Today, a former election commissioner recently said that there was no possibility of machines being tampered with
 magar unhone chunaav ayog ko yah salaah nahin di ki vah tamaam shankaaon ko dur kare
 These issues need investigation pehla ki chunaavon main farjivade kii ashanka
 Such as tampering while moving evms etc
 iske alaava ek theory yah bhi he ki matdaan kaa samay khatm hone ke baad bhi atirikt vot daale gaye, kyonki kuch log vot daalane nahin aae the
 But the figures for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections prove that the election has not been massively rigged
 agar aisa hota to matdaan pratishat bahut adhik bad jaataa
 The second issue is that if there is any mistake or omission then it will not have any effect in any constituency
 ise lekar kanoonee tarika yah he ki kisi ko koi shikaayat he to use yachika daakhil karnaa chahie
 Nobody has done this till now
 lekin iske liye ab bhi kuch hafton kaa vakt bachaa he
 Those who raise objections about this can also demand re-counting and re-voting

 Keeping in mind the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address a rally in Punjab today
 lekin piem ke punjab pahunchane se pehle hi isapar raajnneeti shuru ho gai he
 Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh tweeted before PM Modi's visit and said that he should announce the debt waiver of farmers
 amarinder singh ne kaha ki mujhe khushi he ki pradhanmantri punjab ke kisaanon ko sambodhit karenge
 i would like to say that the Prime Minister should announce debt waiver on this occasion and at the same time he should declare to implement the recommendations of the Swaminathan report
 unhone likhaa ki hamaare pareshaan kisaan agar aap se kuch positive sunenge to acha hoga
 Please do not discourage them
 
 @narendramodiji, good to know that you'll be addressing Punjab farmers today
 Please use the opportunity to announce loan waiver & full implementation of Swaminathan report
 Our distressed farmers will be braving the heat to hear something + ve from you
 Pls don’t let them down

 Under this leadership, PM Modi will try to help farmers today
 piem aaj punjab ke malot main kisaan raily ko sambodhit karenge
 Why is Punjab important? Actually, Punjab is the most important for BJP in terms of 2019 elections and farmers' efforts
 punjab main kareeb 90 fisadi kisaan kharif kii fasal kaa hi utpaadan karte hai, yani sarkaar dwaara liye gaye faisle kaa sabase zyada laabh punjab ke kisaanon ko hone vaala he
 This is the reason that Modi is helping farmers from all over the country from here
 centre sarkaar ke dwaara haal hi main kharif kii fasalon par emspi ko dedh guna kiya gaya he, jiske baad ye kisaanon ke saath piem kaa pehla samvaad hoga
 The Congress has been continuously targeting the Modi government on the issue of farmers, the anger of farmers has also come to light in the past
 aise main chunaav se pehle modi sarkaar kisaanon ko apane haq main karnaa chaahati he, iske liye ab pradhanmantri modi ne hi morcha sambhala he

 On March 22 in the Hajin town of Kashmir, army and police personnel found the bodies of three people - two from lashkar-e-taiba militants and the third from a 12-year-old schoolboy
 suraksha balon kii gheraabandi se pehle bandhak banaae gaye bachche aatif hossain mir ko kavach kii tarah istemaal kiya ja rahaa tha taaki suraksha bal ke jawan mir muhalle ke teen manjila makaan par puri takat se hamalaa na kar paaen
 Ali and Hubab, the terrorists who held the child hostage, were hidden in that house
 aatif kii maut ko lekar ab lashkar ke khilaaf logon main jis tarah gussa badhata ja rahaa he, vaisaa pehle kabhi nahin dekha gaya
 It is now learned that Pakistani national Ali was also involved in the killing of six Kashmiris in the same area last year
 nirmam hatyaein ek paheli bani hui thim kyonki sthaneey log badale ke dar se apana munh sile hue the
 But Atif's death seems to have broken this silence
 sthaneey log na keval ali or uski krurataaon ke bare main khulkar bolne lage hai balki pakistan sthit lashkar ke netritv ke khilaaf naaraazgi jaahir karne lage hai jo apane ugravadiyon par ankush lagane main vifal rahaa he
 The pesticide businessman, Atif's father Mohammad Shafi Mir, says that three days before the terrorist encounter, he forcibly entered her house and took possession of the top floor of the house
 yah makaan mir or unke bhai abdul hamid kaa tha
 This was not the first time Ali and his companions had come to Mir's house in Hajin
 teen maheene pehle ali unke ghar main dhamakate hue aa gaya tha or mir se maang kii thi ki vah college main padhgaye vaali apni badi beti kii shaadi usase kar den
 The frightened family then secretly drove the girl to a relative's house in Sopore
 ladki ke pita bataate hai, ''maine usase kaha ki vah jihad karne (kashmir) aayaa he to use maidan main utarkar apana kaam karnaa chahie
 On hearing this, he got angry and disturbed the people of the house
 ali or uske aadmi aksar unke ghar aane lage or mir par police kaa mubir hone kaa aarope lagaakar unke saath gaali-galouj karne ke alaava hathapayee bhi kiya karte the
 When they came to Mir's house on March 19, Ali and Hubbab took eight members, including five women of their family, to the top floor of the house and took them hostage
 mir or unke ek bhattije ko jab pataa chalaa ki unke parivaar ko bandhak bana liya gaya he to unhone paas main hi apane ek rishtedaar ke ghar jaakar sharan le lee
 Mir says, "ali did not allow the hostages to disappear from their eyes
" keval meri bhabhi or unki beti ko hi neeche jaakar unke (aatankwaadiyon) ke liye khaanaa pakaane kii ijaajat hoti thi
 "the family was tortured and beaten with an iron rod
 sthaneey logon ke mutabik, ali pados ke ek duusare ghar par bhi kabja jamaana chahta tha, jo mir ke ek or bhai kaa makaan tha
 But he could not succeed in his plan as the landlord ran away with a lock on the house
 suraksha balon ne 22 march kii subah jab mir ke makaan or mir muhalle ko gher liya to ali ne mahilaon ko chhod diya lekin 12 saal ke bachche aatif or unke chachaa abdul hamid ko kabje main rakhaa
 Ali hoped that doing so would prevent the encounter for some time
 abdul hamid ke mutabik, kam umr vaala aatankwaadi unhen chhodia chahta tha
 But Ali refused
 unhen jab duusare kamare main le jaaya ja rahaa tha to ve vahaan se bhaag nikalne main kaamyaab ho gaye
 The Lashkar militants then ignored repeated appeals from family and locals to drop Atif
 surakshakarmi nahin chaahate the ki aatankwaadi shaam hone par andhere kaa phayda uthaakar bhaag nikalen, isliye unhone suryaast ke samay makaan ke chaaron taraf baari gola-barood manga liya taaki makaan ko giraaya ja sake
 Mir says sadly, wish! The security forces would have waited a little longer
 jesibi mashin jab unke makaan ke malbe ko hataakar jameen samtal kar rahi thi to mir ne rote hue kaha, ''surakshakarmi chaahate to mere bachche ko bachaa sakate the
 But they did not do so
 '' ek aspataal se anadhikrut rup se praapt report se pataa chalata he ki aatif kii gardan samet puure sharir par chaaku se kaate jane ke nishaan the jo use yatnaa die jane kii ore ishaara karte hai
 Mir is also angry about why the locals, including himself, remained silent against Ali's atrocities
 ve ali ko jaalim or kaatil bataate hue kehete hai, ''ab har koi bol rahaa he lekin ab bolne se kya phayda? vah sabake saath yah sab kar chukaa tha
 Some were also beaten up
 ''is tarah kii naaraazgi sirf mir ke parivaar waalon tak simit nahin he
 Such anger is brewing against Pakistani terrorists everywhere in Hajin and North Kashmir, especially against Lashkar terrorists
 maare gaye ek aatankwaadi ke rishtedaar 26 march ko baraamula loksabhaa seat se neshnal conference ke ummidavaar mohammad akbar lone ke daure kaa hawala dete hue kehete hai, ''unke khilaaf na to ek pathar phenkaa gaya or na hi narebaaji hui
 It was unthinkable before 22 March
 ''police ke bade adhikari bhi sweekaar karte hai ki hajin main log aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf hote ja rahe hai
 But we need to be careful
 is bich pakistan main hajin ke muthbhed ke bare main lashkar netritv kii ore se ek bhi shabd nahin kaha gaya he
 Even the statement issued after an encounter by Lashkar militants is missing this time

 kacchap avatar par mandaranchal parvat rakhaa gaya or devataaon ke nagavasuki kaa istemaal rassi ke taur par hua jiske fan kii taraf rakshas the or poonch kii ore devtaa
 During the churning, several gems came out one by one, such as Eravat and Kalpavriksha, and after all came the Amrit Kalash
 lekin, jaise hi amrit baahar aayaa uske liye devataaon or daanvon main jang chhid gai
 In that snarl, a few drops of nectar spilled into Allahabad, Nashik, Haridwar and Ujjain
 tabhi se har 12 saal baad in jagahon par kumbh snaan kaa parv shuru ho gaya
 The older this belief became, the stronger it became
 har baar kumbh main logon kii bheed pehle se zyada hoti he
 Nobody asks the question why no one has become immortal in the hundreds of books that have passed so far, but the story of Amrit Kalash has become immortal in the history of humanity
 baari baari se har 12 saalon ke baad desh main chaar jagahon par aisa hi jamaavada dekhne ko miltaa he jise kumbh utsav kaa naam diya gaya he
 According to the Puranas, the story tells that it took 12 days for the Amrit Kalash coming out of the ocean to reach the heaven world and one day of the gods is equal to one year of ours

 It extends locally from Parade Ground to Triveni Dam, Daraganj to Nagavasuki and Jhunsi to Arail
 lekin kareeb 50 vargkilometre ke daayre main manaae jane vaale utsav ko lekar thik-thik ye bataanaa mushkil he ki kumbh kii shuruyaat kab se hui
 Although, it is said about Kumbh that earlier it was called an occasion but with time it turned into a festival
 bataaya jaataa he ki 12veen sadi tak ye ek bade saanskrithik sangam ke rup main apni pahchaan bana chukaa tha
 Even the famous Chinese traveler Hiuen Tsang who came to India was the first person who mentioned the Kumbh Mela in his diary
 diary main hindu magh maheene main 75 dinon ke utsav kii baat kii gai he jise lakhon saadhuon, nagarikon, raison or raajaaon ne dekha he
 a wonderful view is also seen in Kumbh

 Actually, Kalpavas has its own importance in Prayag, especially in the month of Magha
 kalpavaas kii shuruyaat pus maheene ke 11wein din se hoti he jo magh maheene ke 12wein din tak chalata he
 The comments kalpavaas ke dauraan shraddhaluon kii jindagi saadagi bhari hoti he or din main sirf ek baar khaanaa khaanaa hota he
 It is believed that all sins of life are cut off by bathing Kalpavas and Sangam and human beings get liberation from the cycle of life and death
 is baar ke mahakumbh ko lekar prashasan ne apni puri taiyaari kar rakhi he taaki lakhon kii taadaad main aane vaale shraddhalu jinaki sankhyan kuch maukey par karodon main bhi ho sakati he unke snaan kaa bandobast ho sake
 But, as soon as the nectar came out, a war broke out between the gods and the demons

 Since then, every 12 years, the festival of Kumbh Snan started at these places
 ye manyata jitani puraani hoti gai utani hi majboot bhi hui
 Every time there is more crowd of people in Kumbh
 yah sawaal koi nahin poochta ki abtak gujri saikadon pushton main koi amar kyon nahin hua, lekin amrit kalash kii kahani maanavtaa ke itihaas main amar ho gai
 After every 12 years in turn, a similar gathering is seen in four places in the country, which has been named the Kumbh festival
 puraanon kii maane to kahani bataati he ki sagar se nikle amrit kalash ko swarg lok tak pahunchane main 12 din lage the or devataaon kaa ek din hamaare ek saal ke baraabar hota he
 Hence the Kumbh celebrations take place at a 12-year distance

 In books, it holds the title of largest gathering of humans on earth
 iskaa failaav sthaneey str par parade ground se triveni baandh tak, daraganj se nagavasuki or jhunsi se arail tak hota he
 But it is difficult to tell exactly when the Kumbh started since the celebration, which is held in a radius of about 50 square kilometers
 haalanki, kumbh ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki pehle yah ek avasar kaha jaataa tha lekin vakt ke saath ye mahotsav main tabdeel ho gaya
 It is said that by the 12th century it had made its mark as a large cultural confluence
 yahaan tak ki bharat aae mashhoor chini yatri huentsang vah pehle shaks the jinhone kumbh meley kaa zikr apni diary main kiya tha
 The diary talks about 75 days of celebration in the Hindu month of Magh which has been witnessed by millions of sadhus, citizens, nobles and kings
 kumbh main ek adbhut najaara bhi dikhataa he
 Here the royal ride departs with full pomp for the royal bath

 Great nobles spend the night on the cold sands of the confluence
 yahaan eent or pattharon ke oonche oonche mahal nahin dikhte or naa hi laal pattharon ke qile kii dhele bhar keemat he
 Sometimes people live in a hut or in a tent

 Such a view is common at the confluence

 Kalpavas begins on the 11th day of the month of Pausha, which lasts till the 12th day of the month of Magha
 tippaniyan During Kalpavas, the life of the devotees is simple and one has to eat only once a day
 mana jaataa he ki kalpavaas or sangam snaan se jindagi ke tamaam paap cat jate hai or manushya jivan maran ke chakkar se mukt hokar moksh hasil karata he
 The administration has made its best preparations for the Mahakumbh this time so that the number of devotees coming in lakhs whose number may be in crores on some occasions can be arranged for bathing

 If you too have dreamed like this, then the time has come to start working on your idea
 yahaan ham aapako aise 5 kaaran bataa rahen jisase yah sabit hota he ki 20-25 saal tak kaa samay aapke liye kyon khaas he
 
 
 1
 aap jin entrprenyor ko apana adarsh maanate hai, jinke kaam ko follow karne kii koshish karte honge, unamem se zyaadaatar logon ne apana kaam 20wein saal main shuru kar diya tha
 Many successful people prove this, such as Bill Gates when he was Microsoft when he was 20 years old
 vahiin mark jakarberg bhi 20wein saal main hi the jab ve fasebuk banane main jute gaye the
 If they can do something new, why don't you? 2
 is umr main aapke paas khone ke liye kuch bhi nahin hota he
 You are neither burdened with responsibilities nor hurried to get rich
 yahi mauka hota he jab aap apane idia par sahi se focus kar pate hai
 3
 20wein saal main aap samasyaon ko alag tarah se dekhte hai
 You have more passion to win and less fear of losing
 aap hameshaasmasyaon kaa halkhojna chaahate hai
 At this age, it is nice to take the most difficult tasks as a challenge
 4
 This is an opportunity to try again and again
 20-25 saal ke bich kaa vyakti asafalataaon ke bare main bahut hi kam sochataa he
 He always feels that the world will soon be in his grasp
 jaruri nahin he ki aapane koi nayaa venture shuru kiya or usamen safalataa mil hi jaae
 If you fail in it, then it will teach you so much that you will definitely get success in the future
 5
 Experience is a lot but not everything
 jaruri nahin he ki jiro anubhav vaale kisi industry ke bare main or uske kaamon ke bare main soch nahin sakate hai
 The benefit of not having experience will be that you will try to learn more and learn about mistakes

 Apart from this, two other persons were injured
 in sabko dekhte hue hi jab team management ko shikhar dhawan ko khilaanaa tha, to unhone strike rate kaa behuda tark diya, jaise ki baat tii-20 yaa vanade cricket kii ho, jahaan strike rate hi sabase adhik myne rakhata he
 If you look at the record, Dhawan's strike rate (over 60) is definitely higher than Murali Vijay (around 47), but technical proficiency as a test opener should be taken into account and looked average
 
 
 lekin jab apane pasandida khilaadi yaa yun kahen 'dost' ko mauka dene kii baat ho, to koi na koi bahaanaa to dhundhna hi padegaa, so team management ne apana tark de diya
 
 
 And Murali Vijay was ruled out of the playing eleven despite recovering from an injury
 
 
 vaise bhi captain viraat kohli jo shikhar ko 'gabbar' kahkar bulaate hai, unka unase yaarana chipa nahin he
 
 
 During the last test in the Windies, we saw both of them sharing ice cream, meaning 'tooth cut bread'
 
 
 phir to kuch bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 
 
 In Uttarakhand, the firing on the electoral fronts has now calmed down
 lakhon kii taadaad main gaanvon-kasbon main bikhri sharaab kii khaali bottlen chunavi nashe kii kahani bayaan kar rahi hai
 Politics cavalry in the electoral Kurukshetra is now shedding its fatigue in the camps
 senapatiyon se lekar sainikon tak sab aaraam farma rahe hai
 The dust of the battlefield is gone, but the mist is still overshadowed by the results
 gaanv kii chaoupaalon or kasbon kii chaay kii dukaanon se lekar rajnatik dalon ke daftaron or sachivalay ke bhadralok tak har jagah apni-apni pasand kii bhavishya kii sarkarein ban rahi hai
 Now, no matter who forms the government, the elections of the third assembly have made it very clear that now the center of politics is moving from the mountains towards the plains
 pahchaan or vikaas kii chaah ne pahaado main jis vishaal janandolan ko janm diya tha, vah das saal main hi nirarthak ho gaya
 Ironically, the specter of despair and isolation is slowly taking hold of the mountains of Uttarakhand
 in chunaavon main sattarudh dal ke khilaaf shikawa-shikayaton or naaraazgiyon kaa ambara tha par vipakshi dal bhi koi khaas ummid jagaane main naakaam rahaa
 The failure of the parties to address the basic problems of the common people was the result that the election was reduced to caste, regional narrowness within the assembly, money power and liquor bottles
 rajya banane ke baad shiksha or chikitsa ke kshetra main halaat 1970 se bhi badtar ho gaye hai
 Even in the British era, the hospitals which had doctors, now also do not have doctors
 1970-80 main jin skool-collejon ko upi ke behtareen shikshan sansthaanon main gina jaataa tha, aaj vahaan yaa to shikshak nahin hai yaa sifarishi log tainaat hai
 When the last two rains wreaked havoc in the mountainous regions of the state, the government there was absent
 sankat ke us vakt main adhikansh vidhayakon se lekar mantriyon tak koi bhi apane nirvachan kshetra main maujuud nahin tha
 In the 21st century Uttarakhand did not get food grains for three months, roads could not be cured even in eight months
 pahaado ke halaat itane badtar ho chuke hai ki har saal hajaaron log vahaan se maidaanon kii ore palaayan kar rahe hai
 The villages are desolate and the entire mountain stands at the mouth of the biggest displacement of history
 pahaado ke prati yah upeksha rajya banane ke baad hi shuru hui he
 Almost all the mlas and ministers have made their homes in Dehradun or Haldwani
 ek bhi vidhayak apane nirvachan kshetra main rahane ko taiyaar nahin he
 The houses of mps of Uttarakhand are in Delhi but not in the mountain
 sansadeey kshetra yaa vidhansabha kshetra unke liye paryaton sthal banakar rah gaye hai
 District panchayat presidents and block chiefs to village heads looking after mlas, ministers and mps have either landed in the plains or left the village and camped in district headquarters
 yah upeksha arthvyavastha main bhi dikh rahi he
 In these ten years a large stream of development has been flowing in the field itself
 yadi seva kshetra ko chhod den to pahaad main sakal gharelu utpaada kii dar negative he
 This is the condition of the state whose growth rate is running faster than 9 percent
 sakal gharelu utpaada main 65 fisadi yogadan teen maidani jilon kaa he or 10 pahari jilon kaa yogadan mahaj 35 fisadi he
 Out of this, if you remove the plains like Kotdwar, Haldwani, Dhalwala and Ramnagar, then this ratio decreases to less than 30 percent
 menuphaccharing kshetra main pahaad kaa yogadan 25 fisadi ke aasapaas he
 In the services sector, it is around 28 per cent
 maidan main prati vyakti aay 33,711 ru
 , While in the mountain it is Rs 22,558
 hi he
 If you calculate the income of a hill villager from agriculture and animal husbandry, then it comes down to Rs 6,374
 hi rah jaati he
 That is, the rural person of the mountain gets Rs 531 every month
 main jivan nirvaah karnaa pad rahaa he
 Call it irony of development, in a state running at a growth rate of 9 per cent, about 32,89,000 villagers of the mountain are 17
 roj main guzaara kar rahe hai
 The average time to reach a doctor in an emergency in the ground is twenty minutes, while the time to reach a doctor in an emergency on a mountain is 4 hours 48 minutes
 sarkari naukariyon main yahaan ke logon kaa anupaat rajya banane ke baad teji se gira he
 This election has proved that people in the mountain are struggling with their existential crisis and traditional politics is not able to address their questions
 do hajaar karod rupye ke bhrashtachar ke kaarobaar se tondiyal ho rahe rajnatik tantra se bhrashtachar or nikammepan ke ilaaj kii ummid nahin kii ja sakati
 There are several economic indices, which will testify to the failure of Uttarakhand as a hill state, but not a single question was mentioned in the manifesto of political parties
 lekhak uttarakhand andolan main sakriy rahe varisht patrkaar hai
 The 116th birthday of rebel Bangladeshi poet Qazi Nazrul Islam was celebrated in his hometown Churulia in Asansol on Tuesday

 If Pakistan accepts the plan that fundamentalist Maulana Sufi Mohammed has given, it may have to pay a heavy price because the formula clearly states that the Pak government will not take any action against the Taliban and its fighters
 formule ke mutabik taliban ke saath pakistan ko bhi un sabhi logon ko reeha karnaa hoga jo donon ke kabje main hai
 Not only this, if the Pak government accepts this formula suggested by TNSM, then it will have to recall the Pakistan Army from schools, mosques and hospitals in Swat Valley

 Grewal was not a resident of Delhi
 unhen dilli sarkaar anukanpa raashi kaise de sakati he
 At the same time, this amount of one crore is the tax paid by the people of Delhi
 yachika main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki is prakaar ke faisle se aam logon main galat sandesh jayega or yah nirnay aatmahatya jaise aparaadh ko mahimamandit kar rahaa he
 It has been alleged that the Delhi government is supporting the decision to commit suicide by giving martyr status, while committing suicide or attempting it is an offense under the Indian Penal Code
 aise maamalon ko protsaahit nahin kiya janaa chahie
 The petitioner alleges that the Delhi government is doing politics
 yah dusron ko pralobhan dena he
 This step of the government is not in the interest of the common people
 itnaa hi nahin yah border par tainaat apane sainikon kaa bhi apmaan he
 The High Court has demanded that the Central Government, the Lieutenant Governor should make a guideline regarding the status of the martyr
