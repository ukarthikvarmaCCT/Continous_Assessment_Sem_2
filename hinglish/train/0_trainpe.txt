 Ranchi, the capital of Jharkhand, ranks 15th in terms of starting a business
 agar baat kaarobaar shuru karne or phir use chalaane kii karen to is maamle main ranchi 9waan sthaan paakar patna (14) ko peeche chhod detaa he

 In case of enforcement of contracts, it takes 792 days in Patna and 985 days in Ranchi
 sampatti kaa panjikaran karana ho to patna main 87 or ranchi main 56 din lagate hai

 The leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, Sanjay Singh, reacted to this and said that 'the party which has only three mlas in the assembly has an office, the party which does not have a single MLA in the assembly, its office is also in front of us and the party whose Government will not have any office in Delhi! The people of Delhi are watching all these 'dirty tricks'

 The report of the committee states that 'land is not the jurisdiction of Delhi Government, therefore the order should be canceled
 yah saaf he ki political party ko jameen dene kaa faisla isliye liya gaya taaki aam aadmi party ko sarkari awaas mil sake
 ' aam aadmi party ke netaa sanjay singh ne is par pratikriya dete hue kaha ki 'jis party ke vidhansabha main keval teen vidhayak hai uske paas daphtar he, jis party kaa vidhansabha main ek bhi vidhayak nahin, uskaa daphtar bhi hamaare saamne he or jis party kii sarkaar dilli main uskaa koi daphtar nahi hoga! dilli kii janata ye sab 'darty tricks' dekh rahi hai

 On this special occasion, we are referring to a few selected songs of Bhupen Hazarika, who bring him to the list of a great lyricist
 o ganga tum bahati ho kyon-bharatvarsh kii sabase pavitra nadi, ganga kii ho rahi durdasha par bhupen hajarika kaa ye geet rongte khadey kar detaa he
 In the song, Ganga Ma herself is being asked why humanity is flowing even after being destroyed and corrupted
 ve gange ke nirlajj bhav se bahane kii baat kehete hai bhupen ke ek album kaa ye gaanaa aaj bhi kaaphi popular he
 This song written by Gulzar in the movie Dil Hum Hoom kare-rudali has been immortalized by Bhupen in his voice
 gane ke donon hindi or asami varjan ko khub pasand kiya gaya
 The music of the song was given by Bhupen
 iske awala gane ke femail varjan ko lata mangeshkar ne gaaya tha
 Aami a Jazabar- It was one of the greatest features of Bhupen that despite being from Assam, he understood the culture spread in every corner of the country spiritually and included it in his art
 unki bengali album kaa ye gaanaa bhi kaaphi lokapriy he
 Dola Ho Dola - Bhupen's song was liked in both Assamese and Hindi languages
 gane main bhupen kii vividhta saaf jhalkati he
 The song is composed quite beautifully on fast beats
 saat hi bhupen kii aawaaj main ye or madhur lagata he
 Samayo o Dheere chalo-rudali is another song in the film, even though it is not very popular, but due to its stance and sensitivity of lyrics, this song is special in itself
 bhupen ne iskaa mujeec diya tha or gaaya bhi tha
 The lyrics were penned by Gulzar
 duniya paraai log yahaan begaane- kalpana laazmi kii film darmiyaan third gender ke mudde par bani chuninda filmon main se ek he
 The film was released in 1997
 film kaa ye gaanaa darshata he ki ek transgender ko jivan main kin-kin mushkil paristhitiyon se hokar guzarana padataa he or kaise samaaj sadiyon se unhen nakaarta rahaa he
 Sham Dhal forest - Got the floor i have no match for the sweetness of this song from the film
 bhupen hajarika ke mujeec main is geet ko udit narayan or kavika krishnamurthi ne gaaya he
 Its lyrics are also fantastic
 foole dana dana-assam kii bihu par bana ye gaanaa vahaan kii samskruti, sabhyataa or rahan-sahan kii ek khubasurat chhavi pesh karata he
 The music of the song has been given by Bhupen Hazarika as well as it has been given by Bhupen Singh and Nitin Mukesh with Bhupen
 ek kali do pattiyaan-gulzaar kii liriks main ye gaanaa vaaki main assam kii awam kii tasviir dikhaata he
 It is wonderful to imagine the culture of the music while listening to the song with lyrics even without video
 gaanen kaa mujeec bhupen ne diya or gaaya bhi unhone hi tha
 Whose it is forever - Bhupen's superb bonding with Gulzar cannot be ignored
 donon ke non pilmin gaanen logon tak badi maatra main bhale naa pahunch paae hon magar ve saare apane aap main kaaphi khubasurat hai or kaanon ko aaraam dene ke saath samaaj ko acha sandesh bhi dete hai
 Many citizens of Bengaluru are deprived of their voter ID card despite applying months ago
 india today kii special invastigeshan team kii jaanch se sanket miltaa he ki in voter ID cards kaa jakhira sambhavat: galat tatwon ke haath lag gaya ho or jiskaa durupyog kiya ja saktaa he
 That too at a time when the voting for the assembly elections in Karnataka is to be held on 12 May
 mangalvaar ko bijepi parshad manjula nanjamuri ke jalahalli sthit flats par chapa maar kar adhikariyon ne 9,746 voter ID card jabt kiye
 This area falls near Rajarajeshwari Nagar Assembly constituency
 ye khabar saamne ai to puure desh ne hairaani se dekha ki kis tarah tivi footage main ek ghar ke andar mej par badi sankhya menvotor ID cardbikhare dikh rahe the
 Manjula Nanjamuri himself denied any involvement with the case, saying that Jalahalli's flat was rented out
 baharhaal, in voter ID cards kii jabti ke baad se hi congress or bijepi main ek duusare par doshaaropan kaa khel shuru ho gaya
 India Today team proceeded with the investigation of photographs of the seized Voter ID cards
 makasad yahi gutthi suljhaana tha ki aakhir ye voter ID cards nagarikon ke paas pahunchane kii jagah is flats tak kaise pahunch gaye
 India Today's team first turned to Jai Bhuvaneshwari Nagar
 ye nimna aay varg vaala ilaaka mana jaataa he
 An attempt was made to find 50-year-old Kantharaju here
 kantharaju kaa voter ID card bhi un 9,746 cards main se ek tha jo jalahalli ke flats se jabt kiye gaye the
 India Today team finally managed to reach Kantharaju
 kantharaju ne bataaya ki unhone chah maheene pehle voter ID card ke liye aavedan kiya tha lekin unhen aaj tak wo nahin mila
 Kantharaju was right when he got his voter ID card from Jalahalli flat, how could he get it
 reporter ne kantharaju se poocha, ‘aapkaa nayaa voter ID card kahaan he?’kantharaju- kahaan he wo? wo abhi tak deliver hi nahin hua
 Reporter- 'when did you apply?' Kantharaju- 'A lady came here
 usee ne photo khinche or kaha ki voter ID card kii delivery ek skool main kii jaaegi
 'reporter-' But where is the card? 'kantharaju-' He said that he will meet soon, will meet soon, but he never met
 ye chah maheene pehle kii baat he
 How can a municipal worker, who barely manages to keep up, always find out where his voter ID card is, how is it possible? ’aasapaas ke ilaake main kai or nagarikon se india today team ne baat kii to unki bhi kamobesh aisi hi kahani thi
 One youth said- 'we have not received our voter ID cards yet
 chaar se paanch maheene ho gaye hai
 Not yet arrived
 ’duusare naagarik ne kaha, ‘unhone kaha tha ki ye 5 may ko ban jayega
 'another citizen said-' The voter is in the process of getting an ID card
 ’jai bhubaneshwari nagar ke matadaataaon ko jaraa sa bhi suraag nahin tha ki jalahalli se jabt kiye zyaadaatar voter ID card unke aasapaas ke ilaake ke nagarikon ke hi the
 The India Today team escalated the investigation
 isi kadi main jalahalli se jabt kiye gaye ek or voter ID card ke pate par reporter pahunche
 The person whose name was the voter ID card, Arumugam, was not known anywhere
 ye pataa laggere ilaake main ‘8-KSCB quarters house’ kaa tha
 Did a large number of voter ID cards come from Jalahalli flats? But is it not likely that such voter ID cards have also come in the hands of wrong elements? Citizens who have these cards would wait and be deprived of their franchise on 12 May and someone else could vote for them
 jalahalli se jabt kiye gaye voter ID cards ke maamle main congress ne guuruuvaar kochunaav ayogmein yachika daakhil kii
 The Congress accused the BJP of having poll irregularities
 duusari taraf bijepi bhi jawaab main congress par aise hi aarope laga rahi he
 The BJP has also demanded cancellation of the voting on May 12 in Raja Rajeshwari Nagar assembly constituency

 - Supreme Court has reserved judgment on arbitration
 court tay karegaa ki is maamle main madhyasthata kii jaae yaa nahin
 Also, all parties have been asked to name for arbitration
 chif justise ne kaha ki sab pakshakaar aaj hi naam de den
 We will issue the order soon
 - ramalala virajman kii taraf se kaha gaya ayodhya kaa matlab ram janmabhumi
 This matter cannot be resolved through dialogue
 saath hi kaha ki masjid kisi duusare sthaan par ban sakati he
 On this, Justice Bobde said that you can keep this side during arbitration
 is par ramalala virajman kii taraf se kaha gaya ki phir madhyasthata kaa matlab kya he?- ramalala virajman kii ore se sies vaidyanathan bahes kar rahe hai
 On behalf of Ramlala Virajaman, it was said that the High Court had tried to resolve the dispute in this matter by mutual negotiation but it could not be done
 - BJP netaa subramanyam swami: madhyasthata ke kuch parameter hai or usase aage nahin ja saktaa
 He referred to the decision of the Constitution Bench in 1994, in which the passing remark was that offering Namaz in the mosque is not an intrinsic part of Islam
 - hindu paksh ne kaha ki maan lijiye kii sabhi pakshon main samjhauta ho gaya to bhi samaaj ise kaise sweekaar karegaa? is par justise bobade ne kaha ki agar samjhauta court ko diya jaataa he or court us par sahmati detaa he or aadesh paas karata he
 Then they all have to agree

 How can we make people binding in mediation
 - justise bobade: jab koi party kisi samudaay kii pratinidhi hoti he, chaahe vah pratinidhi ke mukademe main court kii kaarywahi ho yaa madhyasthata ho
 It should be binding
 - jab supreme court ne poocha ki madhyasthata ke jariye hue faisle ko lakhon logon ke liye badhyakaari kaise banaaya jaae? to muslim paksh ne kaha ki madhyasthata kaa suzav court kii taraf se aayaa he or baatcheet kaise hogi ye court ko tay karnaa he?- justise chandrachud ne kaha madhyasthata kaa makasad pakshakaron ke bich samjhauta karana he
 To this, the counsel for the Muslim side said that we are open to mediation

 ham madhyasthata ke madhyam se lakhon logon ko kaise baandhenge? yah itnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 On behalf of the Muslim side, Dhawan said that the Constitution Bench should ask all parties to keep the entire process of arbitration confidential
 yahaan tak kii madhyasth ko bhi kaha jaae ki wo gopneey rakhen, jab tak court main report daakhil nahin hoti
 - Justice Bobde: There should be no breach of confidentiality by the parties

 - Muslim Advocate: It is up to the court who is the arbitrator? Mediation in camera
 is par justise bobade bole- yah gopneey hona chahie
 - Rajiv Dhawan is presenting his side on behalf of the Muslim party
 unhone supreme court ke do puraane faislon kaa zikr kiya
 - Justice Bobde: It is not just a matter of land but it is also related to emotions
 dil, dimag or bhaawanaaon kaa maamla he
 That is why the court wants to resolve this through mutual negotiations
 - koi us jagah bane or bigade nirmaan yaa mandir masjid or itihaas ko UNDO nahin kar saktaa
 Whether or not Babur was a king or not is all a matter of history
 sirf aapasi baatcheet ke process se hi UNDO ho saktaa he
 - Justice Bobde - Justice Bobade: We have no control over what happened before
 ham is vivaad main ab kya he us par baat kar rahe hai
 - We know the impact of the country's body politics

 At the same time, the way to blackmail them by reviving the matter has also been left open
 -saath main shravya jain Master blaster Sachin Tendulkar, who holds innumerable records in world cricket, will have to lead the Indian challenge in the 7-match ODI series starting in Vadodara from 25 October against the Australian team, which is considered one of their favorite rivals for success
 
 tendulkar banaam australia hogi shrinkhalaaustralia ke paas bhale hi glen mcgra or shen warn jaise mahaan gendbaaj rahe hon jinhone duniyabar ke ballebaajon kii naam main dam kiya ho lekin tendulkar ko australian gendbaajon kaa saamana karne main kabhi pareshaani nahin ai
 Legendary batsman Sunil Gavaskar also believes that the upcoming series will be Tendulkar vs Australia
 unhone kaha, ‘‘mujhe lagata he ki vah ranon kaa bhookha he
 He is ready to show that he still has all the shots
 mujhe lagata he ki yah shrinkhalaa sachin banaam australia hogi
 Tendulkar's dominance over Australia can be gauged from the fact that he scored 44 in his 430 ODI career
 48 kii ausat se 16903 ran banaaye lekin australia ke khilaaf khele 61 maichon main unhone 46
 He scored 2730 runs at an average of 27
 master blaster ne antarrashtriya cricket main isse adhik ran srilanka ke khilaaf hi banaaye hai lekin unki ausat australia ke khilaaf behatar he
 The Mumbai batsman scored 44 in 74 matches against Sri Lanka
 33 kii ausat se 2749 ran batore hai
 Not only this, Tendulkar's bat has risen fiercely on the domestic side against Australia where he scored 53 in 23 matches against this team
 60 kii behtareen ausat ke saath 1233 ran jutaaye hai
 The record of other Indian players is not good
 Tendulkar's record may be great against Australia but it can be a matter of concern for Team India that its other star players have been battling against this team mostly
 tendulkar ke alaava australia ke saamne aakraamak ballebaaj virendra sahvaag, yuvaraj singh, gautam gambhir, captain mahendra singh dhoni ke balle kii dhar kund rahi he jabaki aaf spinner harbhajan singh kii phiraki kaa jaadu bhi kangarooon ko pareshaan karne main naakaam rahaa he
 Sehwag and Yuvraj, who returned to the team after recovering from an injury, have never liked the Australian bowling and both of these bats do not know why there is a fight against this team
 sahvaag ne 205 maichon ke apane karier me 34
 He has scored 6592 runs at an average of 33 but against Australia he is only 22 in 21 matches
 55 kii ausat se 451 ran hi jod paye jabaki bharat main bhi is team ke khilaaf unka pradarshan prabhaavshaalee nahin rahaa jahaan chah maichon main vah 27
 He has scored 167 runs at an average of 83
 sahvaag kii tarah yuvaraj bhi australia ke khilaaf vifal rahe hai or 239 maichon ke apane antarrashtriya karier main 37
 The aggressive batsman, who scored 7098 runs at an impressive average of 75, scored 27 in 28 matches against Australia
 65 kii ausat se 719 ran hi bana paaya he
 Yuvraj has performed more poorly in India where he is only 26 in 12 matches
 18 kii ausat se 288 ran hi bana paye hai jabaki isamen 121 ran kii ek pari bhi shaamil he
 Gautam Gambhir is also not better against Australia
 Among other batsmen, Gautam Gambhir made 30 in 10 matches against Australia
 25 kii ausat se 242 ran banaaye hai lekin bhartiya prashansakon ko yah sunakar niraashaa hogi ki bharat main vah is team ke khilaaf teen maichon main keval 17 ran bana paye hai
 Captain Dhoni definitely scored 36 in 17 matches against Australia
 81 kii ausat se 405 ran banaaye hai lekin is pradarshan ko unki 49
 a career average of 67 cannot be called impressive
 gendbaaji main harbhajan austrailia ke khilaaf naakaam sabit rahe hai or 28 maichon main 48
 Only 24 wickets with a poor average of 54
 bhartiya sarajameen par to unka haal or bhi kharaab he jahaan vah is team ke khilaaf 15 maichon main sirf 10 wicket hi hasil kar paye jabaki unka ausat 66
 Remained 80
 team main vaapasi karne vaale tej gendbaaj ashish nehra bhi australia ke khilaaf chah maichon me 67 kii kharaab ausat se paanch hi wicket chatka paye jabaki ishanth sharma ne is team ke khilaaf chah maichon main 22
 He has taken 10 wickets at an effective average of 7 but the formidable bowler has never faced Australia on Indian soil and the batting friendly pitches here can increase the headache of the host bowlers
 share bazaar nai bulandiyon par he or somvaar ko bisai sensex ne 22,764 ke upar jaakar ek or nayaa record banaaya
 For the past few months, the stock market is witnessing a rapid rise
 vidhaan sabha chunaav main congress kii paraajay ke baad se hi sensex ne upar chadhana shuru kiya tha or itane dinon main kai baar nai bulandiyon ko chhua
 Especially foreign investors, known as fiis, are investing money in the market on a large scale

 Since January, he has invested Rs 28,979 crore in the market
 yah rakam bahut badi he or yah dekhte hue ki udhar america arthvyavastha main ab sudhaar ke sanket mil rahe hai or vahaan bhi nivesh kedaravaaje khul rahe hai, bahut hairaani kii baat he
 Generally, with the recovery of the American economy, the investment should have turned to the north, but at the moment the Ganges is flowing upside down
 saal bhar pehle jo videshi niveshak bharat se palaayan kar gaye the, ab yahaan ek nai sarkaar banane kii aahat se waapas laut rahe hai or vah bhi dhamaake ke saath
 Market experts believe that upa-2's inaction and inability to take decisions had kept the market tied for so many days
 us dauraan niveshak bazaar se dur ho gaye the or dhan kamaane ke anya vikalpon ko talash rahe the
 The result was that property and gold prices had skyrocketed
 darasal niveshak hameshaa dhan kamaane ke vikalpon kii talash karata rahata he
 When he felt that there was no scope for the stock market to grow further, he started investing money in an unusable commodity like gold, which resulted in the yellow metal touching the sky
 yahi haal property kaa hua
 That is, people kept focusing on other options
 lekin ab sab kuch badal gaya he or niveshak waapas aa pahunche hai
 The result of this is that the index ie SENSEX has reached heights
 ek or baat he
 Stock markets always run at sentiments and the contribution of actual events is very limited here
 niveshak or bazaar ke khilaadi aane vaale achche yaa bure samay ke hisaab se hi dhan lagaate hai
 That is, profits are already counted
 yahi baat is baar bhi dekhne ko mil rahi he
 There is a perception in the market that the NDA government will be formed
 isse yah ummid jaagi he ki aane vaala samay kaarobaar ke anuroop hoga or arthvyavastha main teji aegi
 The possibility of Narendra Modi's arrival has also given rise to it
 bazaar ke khilaadi yah maan rahe hai ki modi kii sarkaar majboot to hogi hi, uski nitiyon main paardarshita bhi hogi
 Those policies which were not implemented, will now be implemented
 desh ko sushasan milegaa jiskaa vaada narendra modi kar rahe hai
 And if this is not done, then the stock market will collapse once again like a fortress of sand

 Indrani tied her husband
 Rakhirakhi gets a description in the Bhavishya Purana that when the war started between Dev and the demons, the demons started dominating

 Indrani, Indra's wife, was listening to everyone sitting there
 unhone resham kaa dhaagaa mantron kii shakti se pavitra karke apane pati ke haath par baandh diya
 Incidentally, it was the day of Shravan Purnima
 raja bali se judi kathaskandh puraana, padmapurana or shrimadbhagwat main vaamanavatar naamak katha main rakshabandhan kaa prasang miltaa he
 Lord Vishnu took the Vamana avatar to destroy the arrogance of Danavendra king Bali and came to ask alms to King Bali in disguise as a Brahmin
 bhagwaan ne bali se bhiksha main teen pag bhoomi kii maang kii
 The Lord measured the entire sky, the earth and the earth in three steps and sent King Bali to the abyss
 bali ne apni bhakthi ke bal par bhagwaan se raat-din apane saamne rahane kaa vachan le liya
 Narada told Lakshmiji as a remedy to bring back the Lord

 At some point in every person's life, there definitely comes a time when a person falls prey to mental stress even if he does not want to
 haalanki apane tanaav kii vajahon ko rokna to har kisi ke bas main nahin hota he
 But for those reasons it is up to you to trouble yourself at least
 jiske liye sabase pehle aapako yah baat samajhane kii jarurat he ki aap apane jivan main kis cheez ko kitni ahmiyat dete ho, yaa koi cheez aapako kitna zyada effect kar sakati he
 If you have knowledge of these things then you can definitely control your stress and if you still do not understand anything then do not get upset
 kyonki ham aapako kuch aisi ahm baaten bataa rahe hai, jise apane jivan kaa hissaa banaakar aap apane maansik tanaav ko kam kar sakenge, jaane kya hai wo
 
 
 1
 sidhe hokar chalem:ek shodh main yah baat sabit ho chuki he ki apane sir ko ooncha rakhkarsidhe chalane se mood acha hota he
 Also, by tilting the shoulders, negative thoughts come inside the person
 isliye jitna ho sake sidhe hokar hi chalem
 2
 eksrasij karen:ek nae shodh ke anusaar hafte main kam se kam 3 baar eksrasij karne se maansik tanaav 19 fisadi tak kam hota he
 According to the researchers, those exercising are less stressed, while those under great stress are those who do not exercise at all
 3
 Avoid stressful relationships: Avoid being in a relationship where your partner does not care about you
 jo samay- samay par aapako beizzat kare
 Because such a relationship can stress you instead of making you happy
 4
 Sleep on time: a person comes under stress due to lack of sleep
 kyonki agar aap sahi neend nahin lete to aapakadimag thik se kaam nahin karata
 Due to which you become a victim of stress
 isliye tanaav se dur rahane ke liye jaruri he ki aap sahi neend len
 5
 khud ke liye samay nikalen:family, frends or kaam main log akasar itnaa biji ho jate hai ki wo khud ko samay hi nahin de pate
 Due to which people gradually start coming under stress
 isliye jaruri he ki apni biji life main aap apane liye kuch samay jarur nikaalen or us samay main wo kaam karen jisase aapako khushi mahasoos hoti he
 6
 digital divaais se thodi duuri baraten:internet ordigital divisaki logon ko itani zyada lat lag chuki he ki vahi unki duniya ban chuke hai
 While internet is a given boon of science, it has also become a major reason to stress people
 yah baat kai shodh main bhi sabit ho chuki he
 7
 ek samay par ek hi kaam karen:bhaag daud bhare jivan main samay kii bachat ke liye akasar log ek samay par kai saare kaam karne lagate hai
 Due to focusing on many things at once, none of their work is done properly
 jo logon main tanaav kaa kaaran ban jaataa he
 Therefore, do as much as possible at one time and keep yourself away from stress
 agar aapbijnesakarne kii planning kar rahe hai or chaahate hai ki aapkaa bijness safal ho, to ham aapke liye aesetipslekar aae hai jinhen follow kar aap bulandiyon par pahunch sakate hai saath hi aapako motophaaydabhi milegaa
 Before starting a business, definitely follow these 5 things
 
 
 
 1
 positive sochenapako aise log mil jaaenge
 
 jo kahenge falaan bijness main nuksaan he, koi phayda nahin he
 Do not
 
 
 ghaataa ho jayega
 
 vagairah vagairah
 
 
 You ignore all these things
 or positive sochen
 So if you want success in business, then try to take it to a big level day by day and think positive

 Work with perseverance, how serious is your goal, it depends on your firm goal
 ek bijness main laabh or haani donon ho sakati he, lekin in sab ke bare main naa sochakar aap ek drudh vishwaas ke saath aage badhate rahen
 Believe that success will be in your steps
 3
 Get off with a strong plan Any business in the field is incomplete without a plan
 kab kya karnaa he, kaise karnaa he, aap kitne paise kahaan lagaana chaahate hai
 All these things should be included in your planning list
 4
 Set up a skill: If you are going to start a business, you will not necessarily do everything yourself
 jis cheez main aapkaa acha skill he, sirf vahi karen
 Do not engage in all the work 5
 Take care of your health, work is more important than your health
 agar kisi vajah se aapke bijness main nuksaan ho jaataa he, to uskaa asar sehat par naa padane den
 Also, eat well, spend time with your family and be happy

 Winter is about to leave
 garm kapadon ko rakhane kaa samay aa gaya he
 If you do not want your warm clothes to go bad, then we are telling you the right way to maintain warm clothes
 ye tareeke apanaayenge to agali sardi main aapke oonee or garam kapade nae bane rahenge
 
 
 1- Woolen clothes should always be kept in a dry place
 laaparvaahee ke chalate kai baar ham bathroom main bhi oonee kapadon ko chhod dete hai jo ki sahi tarika nahin he
 Woolen clothes which you are not using, dry them in the sun and keep them in a dry and closed place
 2- jis ataichi yaa bakse main aap kapade rakh rahe usamen pehle akhbaar bichhaakar usapar kuch neem kii sukhi pattiyaan rakh den
 It will not keep moisture and your clothes will be safe
 3- oonee kapadon ko dhulane ke liye hameshaa liquid disergent kaa hi istemaal karnaa chahie
 Apart from this, woolen and warm clothes should be cleaned only with a soft brush
 washing mashin main bhi oonee or garm kapadon ko nahin dhonaa chahie
 These are 7 habits, then you will prove 'bad' husband! 4- Moisture, woolen and warm clothes are enemies
 nami ke kaaran oonee kapadon main fungus lag jate hai jo dikhaai to nahin padate lekin sehat ke liye bahut nuksaandeh hote he
 Therefore, it is very important to show warm clothes in the sun
 5- oonee or garm kapade behad mulaayam hote hai
 They should be kept away from hot water
 garm pani main dhulane se kapade sikud jane kaa khatra rahata he
 Therefore, they should be washed with cold water only
 haalanki bahut gande kapade dhone ke liye halke gunagune pani kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Do these important things with your life partner before getting married
 6- If there is a stain on the woolen clothes, then lightly warm the water first
 dhyaan rakhen, pani bahut zyada garm nahin karnaa he
 Now add a little spirit to this lukewarm water
 is spirit vaale gunagune pani se oonee kapade ko dhoen
 7- The use of normal ion should be avoided while pressing woolen clothes
 oonee or garm kapadon ke liye hameshaa steam aayan kaa hi prayog karnaa chahie
 If steam ion is not available in the house, then press a cotton cloth over woolly and warm clothes
 supreme court ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki agar aaropee jaanch main sahyog kar rahaa ho to hiraasat main poochtacha se bachaa janaa chahie kyonki giraftaar ke saath kaaphi apyash, apmaan or badanaami judi hoti he
 a bench of justices AK Sikri and Judge RF Nariman said, "in cases where the court is of the opinion that the accused has been involved in the investigation and is fully cooperating with the investigating agency and is unlikely to flee, then custody in that case Inquiries should be avoided
 giraftaar ke saath kaaphi apyash, apmaan or badanaami judi hoti he
 'most people do not understand Interbench said,' The arrest has very serious consequences not only for the accused, but also for the whole family and sometimes for the entire community
 zyaadaatar log doshasiddhi se purv ke charan main yaa doshasiddhi ke baad ke charan main giraftaar ke bich antar nahin samajhate
 While hearing the anticipatory bail plea, the seriousness of the charge, the exact role of the accused must be understood and before arrest, the officer must enter the correct reasons for the arrest in the case diary
 'jajon kii bench ne kaha ki ek baar aaropee ko agrim jamaanat par reeha kiya jaataa he to nichalndalat ke samakshatmasamarpan ke liye use majaboor karnaa or phir se jamaanat ke liye aavedan karnaa atarksangat hoga
 The bench said this while granting anticipatory bail to a 17-year-old accused in a sexual assault case
 is maamle main 2014 main rape ke aarope tay kiye gaye the
 -input language agar bhartiya cricket team ne 1983 main 25 june ko vishwa cap trophy nahin jiti hoti to shaayad aaj dakshin africa main chal rahe fifa vishwa cap main desh kii footbal team bhi khelti hui dikhaayi de sakati thi
 The history of Indian football was quite good
 rashtriya team ne 1950 fifa vishwa cap ke liye kwalifai kiya tha, lekin nange pair se khilne kii vajah se unhen bhaag lene kii anumati nahin di gayi
 Even after this, the Indian football team won gold medals in the 1951 and 1962 Asian Games, waving the glory of success
 varsh 1964 main hue eeffsi asia cap main team duusare sthaan par rahi jisamen usne dakshin korea jaisi team ko bhi shikast di thi
 But the 1983 Cricket World Cup in England proved to be a sore point for Indian football as it was from here that football was ignored
 kapil dev kii aguwai main bharat ne 1983 final main 25 june ko westeindies ko 43 ran se shikast dekar vishwa cap khitaab apane naam kiya
 After this, India's focus shifted from football to cricket
 cricket ne dhire-dhire desh main safalataa kaa paracham laharaate hue unchainya bharani shuru kar di, lekin footbal kaa str girtaa chalaa gaya
 Now the situation is such that where the national team looks forward to playing matches at the international level, on the other hand, the country with a billion population prefers cricket and European football instead of domestic football
 fifa vishwa cap main uttar korea or slovenia jaise desh kwalifai karne main safal rahete hai
 At the same time, in the country with the second largest population after China, most of the youth in India prefer football to cricket but despite this the country does not stay anywhere in the qualifying round
 isaki sabase badi vajah unhen buniyadi suvidhaayen nahin muhaiyaa kara paanaa he, lekin gharelu lig kaa ubaau hona or yuva khilaadiyon ke vikaas ke liye koi uchit vyavastha nahin hona hi bhi footbal ke hashr ke kaarnon main shaamil he
 Talking about the economy, Brazil and India are equal in this case, but the focus here is on a game like cricket which requires full kit and so much equipment while football is ignored in which only one football Only work is done
 fifa ne bharat kii madad ke liye kai ‘vijan kaaryakramon’ ko bhi shuru karne kii pahal kii he, lekin uskaa bhi koi phayda nahin ho rahaa kyonki kahin to iske shuru hone main kathinaayee ho rahi to kahin buniyadi suvidhaon kii kami he
 Has the color of Sonia Gandhi scared the Congress or Giriraj Singh? Does Congress get irritated by the black color of Nigeria or Giriraj Singh? What Giriraj Singh said about the mentality of the Congress on fair skin is in many ways full of indecency
 yah sach he ki sonia gandhi italvi hai or gori twachaa vaali hai
 But after coming to this country, he has left no stone unturned to scrape not only his skin but also the color of his soul
 magar giriraaj yah nahin dekh paa rahe to yah sirf unki nazar kii seemaa nahin he, kahin na kahin ham bharatiyon ke bheetar bahut gahare basaa bhedbhaav he jo bahut khurachne par bhi nahin ja rahaa
 The second point of this discrimination connects with Giriraj Singh's statement on the color of Nigerians
 durbhaagya se yahaan bhi ham giriraaj singh kii durbhaavna main saajha karte hai jisaki misaalen ek se zyaada hai
 We beat up black people in the market, and force their girls out of their homes to investigate
 darasal varna vyavastha kaa maaraa bhartiya samaaj gairbarabari kii itani sari qismon kaa aadi he ki vah barabari ke kisi vyavhaar ke bare main kaayade se soch bhi nahin paata he
 One meaning of the letter is color and the other means caste
 is lihaaj se hamaara rangabhed bahut gaharaa he
 If we feel less in front of someone then we are immersed in the ego of growing up in front of someone
 giriraaj singh kii mushkil yahi he
 When they attack Kejriwal, they miss Marich
 ve sonia gandhi par hamalaa karte hai to unhen unki twachaa kaa rang yaad aata he, bhartiya raajnneeti se unke judaav kaa acha yaa bura asar nahin
 Till we have a comfortable feeling of equality within us, then we will sometimes stigmatize someone's white color and sometimes someone's black color
 haal hi main apane sammelan main aresas ne har gaanv main ek kuan, ek shmashaan or ek mandir banane kii baat kahi- mushkil ye he ki uski barabari kii samaj bhi hindutv ke daayre se baahar nahin jaati, puure samaaj kii samarasata or samanta kii baat nahin karti
 The charge that has been placed on him is also a victim of his own kind of discrimination
 shahdara or jagatpuri main rahane vaale log in dinon dengue ke dar se pareshaan hai
 Dengue has killed two women and one male here
 jagatpuri kii minaa ko dengue hone par guru teg bahadur aspataal (jitibi) main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha, lekin unhen bachaaya nahin ja sakaa
 Now dengue has caught her daughter, she is also hospitalized in GTB
 modern shahdara kii rahane vaali kusum kii maut bhi dengue kii vajah se hui
 He was admitted to LNJP Hospital in Delhi for treatment, but could not be saved
 unke pati kaa kahana he ki saaf-safai nahin hone se dengue failaa he
 There are 260 patients admitted in GTB and due to the way the entire area is vulnerable to dengue, a separate dengue ward has been made in the hospital so that people can get the right treatment
 dengue ke badhate khatre ke liye log east emsidi ko kos rahe hai
 People allege that if cleaning and fogging were done on time, the situation would not have deteriorated so much
 barish kaa mausam aa gaya or logon ne ghar se baahar nikalne ke liye chaaton kaa istemaal karnaa bhi shuru kar diya he
 The practice of common umbrellas or umbrella used in India is quite old
 lekin kya kabhi aapane aise chaate ke bare main suna he jise pakade bina hi aap uskaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 Just a few days ago, a magician named Moula posted a video on social media with Magical Umbrella
 is video main moula ke sir ke upar ek drone ambrella najar aa rahaa he
 Moula goes without a stickless umbrella on his head
 insaan ke upar saay kii tarah chalane vaale is ambrella ko pakadaney kii jarurat nahin he
 After both of your hands are free, you can ride a bicycle comfortably or use a smartphone
 barish main is chaate ke kai or bhi phaayde hai
 However, due to the absence of a stick, there will also be a fear of flying in a strong storm
 kaise karata he kaam-sir ke upar udne vaale is drone ambrella main chip lagaaya gaya he, jise phone main ap kii madad se control kiya jaataa he
 After connecting to the smartphone, it moves above the head of the human being
 is ambrella ko abhi ek tarah kaa prototip mana ja rahaa he
 It has not yet entered the market

 Under this system, any commercial vehicle wants to enter Delhi

 After this, whenever they enter the Delhi border with a commercial vehicle, they will get entry in their tag with the money already topped up
 is prakriya main unhen rukne kii jarurat nahin hogi
 It will be automatic with the help of sensors
 iske baad toll par jane kii anumati mil jaaegi

 There will also be considerable time savings after tagging

 koi aapse kahe ki aapako ek aisa ghoda diya jayega, jisase aap chaahe jitne kaam karaaen, lekin vah kuch bhi nahin khayega
 That is, this horse lives without eating and drinking
 yah baat shaayad aapako daadi-nani ke kisse jaisi lage, lekin china ke ek kisaan ne ise sach kar dikhaaya he
 a farmer living in Anyang City, China, was saddened by the work done by horses
 usne apni isi chintaa ko dur karne ke liye ek aise ghode kaa avishkaar kiya he, jo bina khaae-pie saare kaam karata he
 He is capable of plowing the buggy on the road and plowing the fields
 dong jinchen naam ke is kisaan ne aayran horse banaaya he
 He believes that with the introduction of the use of iron horse, horses around the world will be able to live their life in a free way
 insaan kaam lene ke naam par usapar atyaachaar nahin kar sakenge
 The thinking and inventions of this Chinese farmer are being discussed in the media all over the world
 chyna daily kii khabar ke mutabik dong jinchen ko bachapan se hi pashuon se lagaav tha
 When he was 12 years old, one day it came to his mind that humans use horses for riding and carrying goods and even in war
 ghoda ek to insaanon ke kaam bhi karata he or badale main log use maarthe-peetate bhi hai
 He is also a creature
 aise main kai maukey aise hote honge jab uskaa kaam karne kaa man nahin hota hoga, lekin insaan usapar atyaachaar karke usase kaam karaate hai
 Dong used to think about these things, he will one day make a horse that can be used in buggy or tanga
 saath hi is artificial ghode ko agar buggi main lagaaya jaae to baithkar waisi hi anubhuti ho jaisaa original ghode se chalane vaale buggi main hoti he
 This horse has switches, with the help of which it can be turned in any direction, right, left, forward, back
 tippaniyan After many years of hard work, this Chinese farmer managed to make artificial horse
 unke banaae is ghode ko buggi, rath, tanga sabhi main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Also, riding on it also feels like before
 dong jinchen kaa banaaya yah yah 'aayran horse' 1
 12 m
 ooncha or 1
 70 m
 lanbaa he
 Interestingly, no expensive items have been used to prepare this horse
 yah puri tarah se bekaar ho chuke saamaanon se bana hua he
 According to the China Daily news, Dong Jinchen loved animals since childhood
 vah jab 12 saal ke the tabhi ek din unke dimag main aayaa ki insaan ghodon kaa istemaal sawari karne ke saath saamaan dhone or yuddh tak main karte hai
 a horse also does the work of humans and in return people beat and beat him
 vah bhi to ek jeev he
 In such a situation there will be many occasions when he does not feel like doing his work, but humans torture him and make him work
 inhen baton ko lekar dong sochate rahete the, ve ek din aisa ghoda banaaenge jise buggi yaa taange main istemaal kiya ja sakegaa
 Also, if this artificial horse is placed in the buggy, then sitting and sitting will have the same feeling as the original horse-drawn buggy
 is ghode main switch lage hai, jiske sahare se ise daaen, baayen, aage, peeche kisi bhi disha main modaa ja saktaa he
 The comments kai saal mehnat ke baad china kaa yah kisaan artiphisial ghoda main banane main kaamyaab rahe

 mausam vibhaag kaa anumaan he ki is baar monsoon oktober ke duusare hafte tak desh ko chhodega
 25-year record broken by rain, prisoners had to shift, this is the situation in up-bihar The picture of the Indian satellite INSAT-3DR shows that Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Pt
 bangala ke upar dabaav kaa kshetra bana hua he
 (photo-meteorological Department) Warning of heavy rains on 33 percent of the country till October 4, the weather department has divided the country into 36 parts according to the rain
 agle 4 dinon tak yani 4 oktober tak inamen se 12 hisson main chhitrai lekin baari barish kii chetavanee he
 These areas are - Arunachal Pradesh, assam-meghalaya, Mumbai, p
 bengal, sikkim, odisha, jharkhand, bihar, purvi madhyapradesh, chhattisgarh, tamilnadu, pudducheri, karaikal, karnataka or kerala
 Ravi Shankar Prasad admitted that there is a disturbance in the sewer system in Patna, since June 1, the country has received 10 percent more rain than normal since June 1, till now the country has received 10 percent more rain than normal
 iskaa asar ye he ki pani kii kami ab desh main nahin he
 But if the monsoon persists for more days, then the winter season will come soon
 saath thandi ke mausam kaa asar zyada dinon tak rahegaa
 If more than 10 percent of the rain falls, then in the language of the meteorological department, it is given more rain status
 desh main ab tak 10 fisadi se zyada barish ho chuki he
 Area Actual Rain Normal Rain inter-north Eastern India 1240
 7 mimi 1410
 4mm-12% north-west India 586
 0 mimi 599
 5 mm – 2% Central India 1262
 8 mimi 976
 6mm + 29% South India 840
 9 mimi 726
 2 mm + 16% whole country 968
 3 mimi 880
 Why is 6 mm + 10% late in going to the monsoon? According to the Meteorological Department, there are three major reasons for the delay in the monsoon
 pehla he - saurashtra or usase jude uttar-purvi arab sagar ke paas nichle dabaav kaa kshetra bana he
 Due to this, a cyclone is formed here
 doosraa he - ek chakravaati dabaav dakshin-pashchim uttar pradesh ke upar bhi bana he
 The third is - there is a low pressure area in the northern part of the Bay of Bengal
 isliye puure desh main monsooni barish rukne kaa naam nahin le rahi he
 After all, why did Patna submerge, why not any other city? It rained fast in many states
 ab bhi ho rahi he, lekin bihar kii rajdhani patna hi kyon duba
 What was the arrangement in other cities that is not there in Patna? kareeb 700 karod se smart city banaae ja rahe patna ke drenez system par kaam nahin kiya gaya
 The government's attention did not go towards this
 patna se satee ganga, punpun, gandak or son nadiyaan pehle hi khatre ke nishaan se upar bah rahi hai
 Now when it rains continuously for several days, the city's poor drainage system does not have the capacity to drain rain water into rivers outside the city
 isliye puraa shahar jalmagn ho gaya
 Red zone of the sky, see in the eyes of the satellite, Patna's geographical location is the second biggest cause of floods in Bihar
 patna shahar katore jaise aakaar main he
 Looking at the geographical location, it is in the low-lying area yani bahut zyada barish hone par shahar kaa pani baahar nahin nikalataa
 When there is more rain, the water of rivers also starts entering the city
 haal ke varshon main mumbai or chennai iskaa taaja udhaaharan hai
 When it comes to foreign countries, the Netherlands is also situated in a geographical location like a bowl
 lekin vahaan kaa drenez system behad atyaadhunik he isliye vahaan baari barish main pani nahin tikta

 The Election Commission, in its favor, told the High Court that they have rejected the plea of the Aam Aadmi Party mlas to cross-examine the petitioner because they already have all the documents and evidence related to the case
 lihaaja is maamle main cross ejamination kii jarurat nahin lagati
 On August 20, the Election Commission has a second hearing in the Office of Profit case

 Hence, customers need to be careful while withdrawing cash from the ATM as they cannot later make a claim to the bank that they did not receive the cash

 ’’ maan laachaar avirohi hokar rah jaati
 To refuse means to create a ruckus

 Papa is not used to hearing
 unki baat kaa, aadesh kaa paalan hona hi chahie
 "father, your instructions are never fulfilled
