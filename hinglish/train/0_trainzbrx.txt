 Both demanded more than four lakh rupees from the under cover reporter
 rana basu ne kaha, 'bolaa naa ek hi baar aapako dena he

 Somen Banerjee- 'you give 25 thousand to him and you give us four (lakhs)
 'jab andercover reporter ne parshad swati se sidhe baat karaane ke liye kaha to banerjee ne kaha, 'wo kya karengi? aap mujhase baat karo

 Rana Basu- 'I came to know that casting (roofing) is being done at a construction site in my area

 On this, he started pleading that don't stop work, i am looking, i am looking (about our demand)

 'the fictitious plan to open the restaurant, to what extent Syndicate Raj's canker spread, it was clear from the talk of TMC worker Sushanto Das

 If the deal is finalized, Sujoy Das talked about ensuring a part of his profit through selling building materials and watching the construction work

 This is our profit
 hamen tabhi munafa hoga jab ham material supplai karenge

 adhikariyon kii mileebhagatye syndicate kisi underground jagahon se nahin balki adhikariyon kii mileebhagat se khuleam chalate hai
 Harendra Singh, chairman of Dum Dum Municipality, insisted on the undercover reporter to buy the building from the material syndicate itself
 harendra singh ne under cover reporter se ye tab kaha jab usne band pade restaurant ke pehle maale kaa punarnirmaan karne kii baat kahi
 Singh said, 'local youth (syndicates) will insist that they buy building materials like stone and sand from them
 koi gadabad nahin hogi
 
 
 Just take all this from them
 'jab singh se poocha gaya ki is tarah ke sidinkets ko ijaajat hi kyon di jaati he, inhen roka kyon nahin jaataa to singh ne tamtamaa kar kaha, 'kyon rokenge, kyon rokenge, bolie
 
 
 Will those people eat 
 
 aap bolte hai ki rokte kyon nahin hai
 
 
 You will earn alone

 My aunt Krishna Bose, who is 90 years old, was attacked

 ' Former Indian team batsman Virender Sehwag feels that Mahendra Singh Dhoni has every right to decide when to retire
 unhone saath hi chayankartaaon se apil karte hue kaha ki vah purv captain ko apni ranneeti ke bare main bataa den
 Since the World Cup is over now, the news of Dhoni's retirement has started rekindling
 aisi bhi khabaren hai ki bharat ko 2011 main 28 saal baad vishwa cap dilaane vaale captain ko aane vaale windies daure main team ko jagah na mili
 Dhoni's slow batting in the recently concluded World Cup in England and Wales was under question
 ek angreji samachar channel par charchaa ke dauraan sahvaag ne kaha, "yah dhoni par chhod dena chahie ki vah sanyas kab lenge
 The job of the selectors is to talk to Dhoni and tell him that he can no longer give opportunities to Dhoni
 "sahvaag ne saath hi ki kaha ki kaash unke samay main chayankarta unase bhi apni ranneeti saajha karte
 Sehwag said, "I wish the selectors had asked me about my strategy also, i would have been able to tell them
 "sahvaag ne jab sanyas liya tab chayan samiti ke adhyaksh sandip patil the
 Patil was also present in this panel
 patil ne kaha, "sachin tendulkar se unke bhavishya par baat karne kii jimmedaari mujhe or rajinder singh hans ko saunpi gai thi or sahvaag se baat karne kii jimmedaar vikram rathore ko saunpi gai thi
 When we asked Vikram, he said that he had spoken to Sehwag, but if Sehwag is saying then i take full responsibility for it
 "sahvaag ne iske jawaab main kaha, "vikram ne mujhase baat jarur kii thi lekin tab jab main team se baahar ho chukaa tha
 It would have made sense if he had talked to me before he was removed from the team
 khilaadi ko baahar karne ke baad usase baat karne kaa koi matlab nahin he
 If Prasad excludes Dhoni at this time and then talks to him, what will Dhoni say, that he will play domestic cricket and if he can do well there then he should be selected in the team
 baat yah he ki chayankartaaon ko khilaadi se baat tab kerani chahie jab unhen team se hataaya gaya nahin ho

 Saini had said that he would resign if the Jats were given reservation
 unhone kisi bhi tarah ke aarakshan kaa virodh kiya tha
 Khattar wants a permanent solution Seeing the violent stance of the Jat movement and the uncontrollable situation, Khattar convened an all-party meeting on Friday to consider the matter
 khatter ne kaha he ki sarkaar is mudde kasthaayee samadhanchaahati he
 In the meeting itself, he announced the formation of a committee on Jat reservation
 yah navgathit kamity 31 march tak apni report saunp degi
 The Jat leaders of Congress and INLD also appealed to withdraw the agitation after assuring the confidence of the opposition Chief Minister Khattar who came along

 The political earthquake that had emerged from the book of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's media advisor Sanjay Baru had not even stopped that former coal secretary PC Parakh had also questioned the Prime Minister in his book
 unhone kaha he ki manmohan singh ek aisi sarkaar ke mukhiya the jisamen unhen bahut kam raajnneetik adhikaar hasil the or vah mantriyon ko control karne main naakaam the
 ex-coal Secretary Parakh's book 'crusader or Conspirator?' Retired in December 2005
 Colgate and Other Truths' released on Monday
 parakh ne apni kitaab main likhaa he ki unhone apane kaarykaal main saansadon ko blackmailer banate dekha he
 According to him, his suggestions on coal block allocation were not given due consideration
 unhone bataaya, 'ham aise halaat main pahunch gaye the, jahaan mukhya sachiv bhi netaaon kaa gulam banane ko majaboor kiye jate the
 My book is about the decline in our political system
 ''PM ne kaha tha roj hota hum apmaan kaa shikaar'parakh ek ghatana yaad karte hai jab vah tab ke cabinet sachiv bike chaturvedi ko istipha dene ke baad pradhanmantri se milane gaye the
 Parakh has stated that he had resigned because BJP MP Dharmendra Pradhan insulted him during the Standing Committee meeting and there was no hearing from the government
 17 agast 2005 ko main aupchaarik vidaai ke taur par pradhanmantri se mila
 i wanted to talk to him about the humiliation that mps often do to bureaucrats
 is par pradhanmantri ne kaha ki vah yahi samasya har roj jhelte hai
 But if he starts resigning on all such things, then it will not be in the interest of the country
 'purv koyala sachiv ne likhaa he ki vah nahin jaanate ki manmohan ke istipha dene kii surat main bharat ko behatar pradhanmantri miltaa yaa nahin
 According to him, 'he had very few political rights in his government
 2ji or koyala ghotaale se unki chhavi ko bhi dhakka laga tha, haalanki vyaktigat rup se unka bedaag record tha
 The former coal secretary asked CBI Director Ranjit Sinha why the FIR was not filed against the PM in the allocation of Talabira coal mine in Odisha to Hindalco
 unke mutabik, talabira kol block ke aavanton kaa faisla manmohan singh ne hi bataur koyala mantri liya tha
 Parakh has alleged that Ranjit Sinha has taken action against him in an attempt to impress the Supreme Court and recover from the image of a parrot
 unhone aarope lagaaya he ki sibiai unka shikaar karnaa chaahati he or sinha ne niyam-kanoon taak par rakhkar unke khilaaf karrwai kii he
 If Sinha believes that the Talabira-2 coal block was allotted to Hindalco under a conspiracy, then he should have the courage to nominate the Prime Minister in this case as well
 gauratlab he ki odisha kii talabira kol block hindalco ko aavantit karne ke maamle main sibiai ne parakh ke khilaaf cese darj kiya he
 It is alleged that Parakh sided with the coal block allocation to Hindalco
 apni pustak main parakh ne jaanch agency ke is kadam par sawalia nishaan lagaaya he
 He asked in a questioning manner, if the CBI sensed conspiracy and corruption in this case then why did he not file an FIR against the PM
 parakh ke anusaar, kisi bhi sachiv mantri kaa kaam keval sifarish karnaa he
 It is the minister's job to take a final decision on this
 unhone sawaal kiya ki unke khilaaf exiar darj karne se purv sibiai ne piemo kii filon kii jaanch kyon nahin kii
 He, however, clarified that the PMO did not pressurize him in the matter of allocation of coal blocks to Hindalco

 com / grzzhbhh8t— BCCI (@BCCI) October 9, 2019 The top-order problem seems to have been solved, with Rohit Sharma hinting to emerge as a great opener in Test cricket with two consecutive centuries
 mayank agarwal bhi har maukey ko bhunaane ke fan main maahir hai
 In Visakhapatnam, he scored his first double century in Test cricket, which seems to solve India's top-order problem, at least in domestic conditions
 nigahen pich par, spinneron ko milegi madad?bharat ko iske baad bangladesh se bhi do test khilne hai
 Apart from Rohit and Mayank, India also has batsmen like Kohli, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane and Hanuma Vihari
 isi maidan par pichhali baar 2017 main spinneron kii madadgaar pich par australia ke of spinner nathan leone ne bhartiya ballebaajon kii haalat khasta kar di thi
 There is no possibility of getting that kind of pitch this time

 raipur se 80 kilometre dur mahanadi ke tat par based sirpur kaa naam das saal pehle us vakt charchaa main aayaa tha jab yahaan khudaai main chhathi shatabdi kii sabhyataa ke nishaan mili the
 Sirpur is again in discussion, because of the gross neglect of the signs of civilization
 yahaan mili durlabh pratimaayein, pracheen sikke, tamrapatr jaisi bahumoolya dharohar bagaiyr suraksha ke camp house main padi hai
 The problem of negligence is that people have built houses around sites of archaeological importance
 rajya ke puraatatv salaahkaar arun sharma kehete hai, ''puratathvik mahatv kii jagah ke 100 meter ke daayre main nirmaan kaary nahin ho saktaa
 The district administration has been asked several times to stop construction at such places in Sirpur, but it will not louse even its ears
 ''sirpur main khudaai ke 38 sthalon kii suraksha keval saat chaukidaaron ke bharose he
 In the absence of security, all the items including the idols here are being stolen, which have millions of rupees in the international market
 keemat he
 Apart from the thieves, these idols are also in serious danger from the people around them, who take them to their homes and use them as decoration items
 ye pratimaayen kahin seedhi par to kahin kisi angan main chinava di gai hai
 Archaeological experts believe that these traces of ancient civilization can change the fate of Sirpur
 puraatatv premi nitin singhvi kehete hai, ''buddha mathon kii vajah se sirpur antarrashtriya paryaton centre ke rup main ubhar saktaa he
 "but at the moment there is a crisis on their own existence
 khudaai ke liye prastaavit kai nai jagahon par avaidh kabja he
 There is no coordination among government agencies for the preservation of such sites

 Very close to an ancient Shiva temple, a house is being built at about 50 meters

 The government should not hesitate to vacate the village for its excavation
 '' mukhyamantri raman singh ne sirpur ke pura avasheshon ko sangrakshit karne ke uddeshy se 2009 main yahaan ek sangrahalay banane kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 But it became just a declaration
 sirpur ko world heritage banane main madad karne ke liye 2010 main unesco kaa ek dal raipur aayaa tha
 But after meeting in the ministry, the team returned without reaching a conclusion
 sutron ke mutabik isaki vajah thi sirpur main nunatam jarurat kii chizon kaa bhi abhaav

 There is no public transport from the state capital Raipur to Sirpur

 duusari baar paas kiya physical testadusri baar phir prayaas kiya or apni kamajori ko majboot karte hue physical test paas karsab-inspectorpad hasil kar liya
 Let us tell you that two months before this, Anita underwent surgery due to a tumor in Owerri
 lekin kuch kar dikhaane kii jid unki beemaari ke aage behad feeki thi
 Anita joined the District Reserve Police Line as Subedar
 unhen training ke liye sagar bheja gaya
 During this time, the case of Devors with her husband reached the court

 However, she was also not satisfied with the DSP post and started preparing for the MPPSC exam for the higher post deputy collector
 april 2016 main unhone yah pariksha bhi paas kar lee or isi saal march main unka intervyuu hua he
 Anita is waiting for the result
 saath hi wo dspi joining order milane kaa bhi intjaar kar rahi hai
 The BJP Central Election Committee meetings continue
 mana ja rahaa he bijepi apane ummidavaaron kii teesri list shuukravaar ko jari kar sakati he
 This list will include the names of candidates from Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Haryana, Kerala, Lakshadweep
 lekin sutron ke mutabik uttar pradesh, dilli or gujarat ke ummidavaaron ke naamon kii ghoshnaa abhi nahin hogi
 In such a situation, from where Narendra Modi will contest elections, it is expected that it will not be announced yet
 khabar he ki narendra modi do seat se chunaav lard sakate hai
 One of these seats can be from Gujarat and the other can be from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh
 sutron kii maane to modi khud gujarat or upi se chunaav ladane ke icchhuk hai
 In such a situation, Varanasi MP Murali Manohar Joshi can be given party ticket from Kanpur
 vahiin patna sahib seat se party shatrughna sinha or ravishankar prasad ke naam par vichaar kar rahi he
 Apart from this, Navjot Singh Sidhu or Arun Jaitley can be fielded from Amritsar seat of Punjab
 desh puri tarah se chunavi maahaul main he, netaaon se lekar kaaryakarta har koi active he
 Apart from rallies, this time there is a new war going on on the digital platform
 jiskaa asar haal hi main vikipedia par dekhne ko mila
 Here, someone has tampered with the profile of former Union Minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Sharad Pawar and called him the most corrupt leader of the country
 darasal, kisi phek acount ke jariye sharad pavaar ke vikipedia profile ke saath chhedchhad kii gai
 He was first described as the most corrupt leader of the country in his profile, then later changed to the most loyal leader of the country
 haalanki, vikipedia kii is jaankaree kaa screenshot viral hone ke baad ise thik kar diya gaya
 Significantly, anyone can update any information on Wikipedia by creating their own account
 isse pehle bhi kai baar aisa hua he jab kisi badi celebrity kii profile ke saath chhedchhad hui he
 Just a few days ago, the same happened with the profile of Ranjit Singh Mohite Patil, another NCP leader, when he was being shown the leader of three parties simultaneously
 aapako bataa den ki maharashtra main sharad pavaar kii party NCP kaa congress ke saath gathbandhan he
 NCP is contesting on 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra and Congress in 26 seats
 donon partiyon ko apane cote main se hi chote sahyogi dalon ko seat deni hogi
 NCP chief Sharad Pawar is not contesting the Lok Sabha elections this time
 maharashtra main chaar charan main loksabhaa chunaav hone hai
 Voting will be held on 48, 11, 18, 23 and 29 April
 chambal
 
 
 This is the name, as soon as it is mentioned, the picture of the bandits starts floating in front of the eyes
 teen teen rajyon kii simaaon main saikadon mile ke daayre main failaa ye wo behad he jiske daaman main jurm kii duniya ke namaaloom kitne hi khooni kisse dafn hai
 It is said that the Chambal's water effect is such that it forces people to revolt and lift a gun in their hands
 magar aajkal chambal achaanak khaali ho gaya he
 Do you know why? Because the election has arrived
 dardri mitti ke oobad-khabad tile
 Densely cut shrubs and strong river
 ji haa, ye chambal he
 The same Chambal whose name comes only on the tongue, the sweat of the good ones are left
 jehan main khoonkhaar dakuor daakuon ke khaufnak adde tair jate hai
 Who knows which robber is hidden in this rugged corner of Chambal? Do not know when from where suddenly started firing bullets? Common man is common man
 
 
 khud pulisavaale bhi bagaiyr palaton ke chambal me ghusane se panaah maangate hai
 The Chambal Valley in the state of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh borders has been a headache for society and law for the past several hundred years
 partiyon ke chunavi prachaar main jute hai chambal ke dakumgar in dinon chambal khaali he
 Do you know why? Because the bandits who rule Chambal are currently engaged in a campaign to decide the future of the next government to rule the country
 ab aap soch rahe honge ki bhala chambal ke daakuon kaa chunaav se kya vaasta? to janaab siyasat kii bisaat par aaj ke daaku bhi khaddardhariyon ke mohare ban chuke hai
 In fact, the robbers of Chambal are busy in campaigning loudly with money from political parties
 or isiilie unhone chunaav tak apane asli peshey yani daakaajani se kinarakshi kar lee he
 The dacoits do not have any new relationship with politics, like the Chambal dacoits have no new relationship with politics
 chambal ke daakuon kii dhamak chunaav main hameshaa se sunai padati rahi he
 In fact, where there is no mistake with the voters of political parties, they resort to strength and terror
 chunaav se kareeb maheene bhar pehle hi netaaon ke ishaare par chambal ke daaku apane-apane ilaako main ummidavaaron ke naam kaa fakhmaan jari kar dete hai
 Then who dares to trust the ballot in front of the bullet
 maheene bhar ke chunavi prachaar ke evaz main daakuon ko jo pis milti he wo jaan jokhim main daal kar daakaazani se hone vaali kamai se kahin zyada hoti he
 Politics is at the root of the story of Chambal becoming, politics is at the root of the story of Chambal's infamous Chambal
 kareeb deb hazaar saal pehle unani samraat sikandar kii hukumat ke khilaaf is ilaake ke logon ne baagiyon ke taur par apana pehla oparation chambal se hi shuru kiya tha
 Just then, Chambal became a habitat for the rebels
 iske baad jab-jab hukumat ke khilaaf baghawat kaa paracham buland hua to is ilaake baagiyon ne sidhe chambal kaa rukh kiya
 Here will tell you what role the Chambal and Chambal bandits are going to play in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 kisko dhamka rahe hai kisko jita rahe hai or kisko haraa rahe hai?chambal kaa raajnneeti se bada purana or gaharaa rishta rahaa he
 There has been no election in which the Chambal bandits have not participated
 chaahe khud chunaav lard kar yaa phir chunavi maidan main utre ummidavaaron ke samarthan yaa virodh main farmaan jari kar
 And this time the picture is the same again
 puraa mulk beshak loktantr ke sabase bade tyohaar yani chunaav ke shor se sarabor ho lekin bundelkhand ilaake ke banda jile ke navganva gaanv main puure desh se alag din ke ujaale main bhi sannata pasra hua he
 Neither the elders nor the children play openly in the village, because the region is forced to live under the shadow of terror in this phase of elections
 jaise jaise chunaav ki taarikh najadik aa rahi he yahaan ke logon kii jindagi nark hoti ja rahi he
 Lalaram is the head of the village of Navagawa
 vah kehete hai - 'mujhe dhamkee ai thi paise maang rahe the do baar phone aayaa hamane kahaan hamaare paas paise nahin he
 The gardener is caught
 wo bacchon ko uthaa le jate hai
 Lalaram has the responsibility of raising a family of 40 people from 20 bighas of land
 lekin alam ye he ki har aane vaali aahat inke saath saath puure parivaar ko buree tarah daraa detii hai
 Lalaram's relative Prabhavati said while crying - 'afraid, the crop is standing, the fields are all lying like this, there is no way forward, the boy hides the child in the house
 lalaram ki patni rajkumaari ne rote hue kaha - 'din kaa kaam karte he, phir chaar baje ke baad ham baahar nahin ja sakate
 Can not even go to the bathroom
 ye mahaj ek gaanv kii kahani nahin puure ilaake kii hakeekat he
 The rugged Bundelkhand has once again become a refuge for dacoits
 madhya pradesh se lekar uttar pradesh ke satna, chitrakoot, mahoba, hamirpur or banda jaise 13 jilon main dakaiton kii dehshat he
 Dayaram, who is looking for his life in pen lines in Banda's Naroni, fears that the streak of life may not get short
 karj lekar navganva main dukaan shuru karne vaale dayaram ko chunaav kaa ye mausam bahut khal rahaa he
 Dayaram of Naraini block in Banda said - i have to pay money to buy two cartridges, ask for 20 thousand rupees from me, where do i have it
 sangram naam kaa badmaash he, paper main roj aa rahaa he, phir phone aayaa sar kaat denge tumhaare bachche ko maar denge, ham bhaag aae, koun vot karne jaayegaa, chunaav ke liye to ye kar rahe hai
 In fact, the poverty of the area is the fate of the entire Bundelkhand region and this same fate has forced them to live under the shadow of terror
 pani kii ek-ek boond ke liye tarasane vaale bundelkhand ke anndaata kii yun to har fariyaad indra devtaa ke naam par hoti he par chunavi mausam main gaanv gaanv main lage aise binar har kisi ke chehre par chintaa ki lakeere khinch dete hai
 In desperation, people have now vowed to boycott the election
 yahaan tak ki kuch logon ne to samuhik aatmadah tak karne kaa iraadaa jaahir kiya he
 Raj Bahadur said - My daughter's marriage is stopped, on May 2, she will not vote
 jairam ne kaha- sab netaa ek jaise he chunaav ke baad samuhik aatmadah karenge ham sab
 'in the 1970s, the dacoits in Bundelkhand whipped up terror, the Gaya Kurmi, Dadua and Thokia oppressions served to crush Bundelkhand's desperate expectations
 ab ek baar phir beete kal kii kahani gaanvvaalon ko sataane laut ai he
 People's faces are also used to suffering, these eyes have neither dreams nor any enthusiasm
 or chunaav ke is mausam main ek bhi aisi aawaaj inhen nahin sunai di jo inaki dushwariyaan dur kar sake
 The victim's daughter Rubina says - the miscreants asked for money
 paise pita ke paas the nahin
 He died thinking this way
 ' rubina ke dada ne kaha - pareshaan hai
 The fear of miscreants is on small children
 jaisaa maalik chaaheda vaisaa hoga
 The crop was also ruined
 alam ye he ki bundelkhand ke ilaake main balkhadia jaise darjanon giroh kaa dabadabaa he
 And under the guise of such gangs, political parties are baking their political loaves
 kisi naa kisi vakt bundelkhand bhi kisi rajaneta ki ankho kaa tara tha
 There was a lot of discussion, as much bad luck as these fakirs, such a big personality shone on the doorstep, sometimes Rahul's mercy and sometimes Akhilesh's donation
 yun hi bijli kaundhti rahe, so bhagya ne ye likh hi diya kii naa to inaki badanasibi khatm hogi naa to inaki muflisi
 In order to win the candidates, the movement intensifies in the rugged Chambal as soon as different weather comes
 yahaan alag-alag partiyon ke ummidavaaron ke saath-saath alag-alag daakuon ke giroh bhi apane-apane ummidavaaron ko jitaane ke liye alag-alag hatkande apanaate hai
 And the most effective way of this is fear
 yahaan chunavi naaron se zyaada us farmaan ko asar hota he jo in daakuon kii bandukon kii naal se nikalataa he
 Voting on Bundelkhand's four Lok Sabha seats on April 30, like the entire country, has been done in Bundelkhand of Uttar Pradesh, and on April 30, four Lok Sabha seats of Bundelkhand are to be cast in Banda, Jhansi, Jalaun and Hamirpur
 lekin yakeen maniye yahaan ki chaaron sansadeey siton main se ek banda loksabhaa seat kaa safar itnaa aasaan nahin he
 From here the path of the corridors of power passes through the shadows of bayonets
 darasal aaj bhi is ilaake main daakuon kii dhamak sunai detii he
 The ground reality of Banda is that as soon as the election comes, the gangs of the rugged bandits come to the field to win the elections to their candidates
 bundelkhand main kai dashakon tak dakaiton ne apana samrajya failaa kar rakhaa
 But in 1978, Shiv Kumar Patel aka Dadua started interfering in the politics of the area and from that time on, this trend has been going on unabated
 lekin 2007 main mayawati sarkaar ke dauraan upi kii special task force ne dadua ko maar giraaya or phir agle hi saal yani 2008 main ilaake ke ek or khoonkhaar daaku thokia kaa bhi ancounter kar diya
 But after 6 years, the situation is once again becoming uncontrollable and the biggest reason for this is the gangs of dacoits of the area who are supporting their candidates
 or inamen sabase bada naam he sudesh patel urf balkhadia kaa jiske upar paanch lakh kaa inaam he
 Today, dozens of gangs such as Balkhadia are strong in Bundelkhand
 wo isliye kyonki unhen alag-alag raajnneetik dalon kaa sangrakshan mila hua he
 This is the reason that there was a time when the notorious dacoit Dadua issued this decree
 muhar lagegi hathi par
 
 
 Otherwise, a bullet will be found on the chest and nose will be found in the valley
 
 
 aaj usee dadua ke saathi rahe aar ke patel banda se bispi ke ummidavaar hai jo isse pehle samaajawaadee party ke tikat par chunaav jeet chuke hai
 SP has given ticket to Dadua's brother Bal Kumar Patel against him
 donon par hatya ki koshish, marpet, avaidh vasuuli karnaa or dakaiton ko sangrakshan dene jaise darjanon maamle darj hai or dono hi ek duusare par dehshat failaane kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 Band BSP candidate RK Patel said - The people of Banda want Aman, SP created an atmosphere of fear, their people are intimidating, mother daughters are not able to go out of the house
 banda se sapa ummidavaar bal kumaar patel ne kaha - dadua kii nahin koi viraasat he jo he mulaayam singh kaa maargdarshan he , ye jo aar ke patel hai inaki kol ditels nikalava lijie sab saaf ho jaayegaa, ye sajeesh he inaki hamen fansaane kii
 Gun politics dominates the politics of Bundelkhand, gun politics dominates the politics of Bundelkhand
 dakaiton ko rajanithik dalon kaa sangrakshan miltaa rahaa he
 The two relatives of Dadua are face to face, both are cursing each other and both are changing parties whenever they want
 matlab ye ki jab tak loktantr yunhi bhay kii bediyon main jakadaaa rahegaa tab tak isi tarah chunaav kaa makhul udata rahegaa
 Even today it seems that nothing has changed in Banda
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii dastak yahaan ke logon ke liye ek baar phir dehshat kaa paigaam laai he
 India on Wednesday accused Pakistan's lawyers of using abusive language during a hearing in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case in the International Court of Justice (ICJ)
 pakistan ke vakeelon ne court main abhadra shabdon kaa istemaal kiya jisapar bharat kii ore se vakil harish salve ne aapatti jataai

 Harish Salve said, "india strongly object to the abusive language of Pakistani lawyer
" ’unhone kaha ki maamle main kisi samprabhu raashtra kii aalochana aisi bhashaa main honi chahie jo duusare desh kii garima ke mutabik ho, aisa raashtra jisase duusare raashtra kaa janm hua he

 India on Wednesday got a maximum of 90 minutes for the last arguments in the case
 ab pakistan guuruuvaar ko bharat kii jirah par jawaab degaa or use bhi 90 minute kaa vakt diya jayega
 The ICJ is likely to give a final verdict on the Jadhav case by the summer of 2019

 Why do worship of Naga Devata In our religious texts, Naga Devata has been associated with Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu
 bhagwaan shiv ne nagdevataa ko gale main dhaaran kiya he or bhagwaan vishnu sheshnag ke singhaasana par shayan karte hai
 Our culture considers Nagadevata as the protector
 nagpanchami: kundali ke dosha or aarthik tangi dur karne ke liye karen ye upaybharat krishi pradhan desh he aisi manyata he kinagadevatakheton kii raksha karte he, fasal ko nuksaan pahunchane vaale jeev jantuon ko kheton se dur rakhte hai, chuuhe, kide, makode aksar fasal ko nuksaan pahunchaate hai lekin nagdev ke bhay se aise jeev kheton se dur rahete hai
 That is why farmers worship the Goddess on the day of Naganpanchami
 nagpanchami kaa rahu-ketu se conectionbhartiya jyotish ke anusaar yadi aapke jivan main sangharsh bahut zyada he yadi aapke kaam banate-banate bighad jate hai, yadi aapaki kundali main saare grah rahu-ketu ke bich hai to sawan maheene kii panchami ke din rahu-ketu kii shanti ke liye vishesh pujan kar sakate hai
 Rahu is considered to be the face of the snake as a symbol, hence its peace has special significance on the day of Nagpanchami

 AAP leader Ashutosh defended the sacked minister Sandeep Kumar by writing an article on the blog and named the names of Nehru, Gandhi and Lohia in this connection
 is par bijepi ne press conference kar kaha ki ashutosh ne besharmi bharaa lekh likhaa he, lekh main mahatma gandhi ke saath sandip kumaar kaa naam likhaa he
 BJP asked Kejriwal to tell if he agreed with Ashutosh? BJP state president Satish Upadhyay said that if this is a private issue then why was the video recording done? Is Ashutosh against Kejriwal and Sisodia's decision to remove Sandeep? Addressing the journalists, the BJP state president said that there is still investigation to be done, yet the debate is still, why did Ashutosh compare Sandeep with the country top leader? Is that Sandeep? BJP demands that Kejriwal should not come out through tweet and clarify on this issue and apologize

 After all, why not, it seems that the party fights elections wherever the election comes

 ) imran khan pakistan ke nae pradhanmantri ke taur par aaj pehle din apane offis kaa rukh karenge
 Earlier on Saturday, after taking oath, Prime Minister Imran Khan has made it clear that his tenure will be different from the former Prime Ministers and he will start from his home to strengthen the country's economy
 pakistan ke sabhi sarkari vibhaagon ke adhikariyon ko sakht sandesh dete hue imran khan ne faisla liya he ki vah pradhanmantri awaas par mahaj 2 chaparaasiyon kii madad lenge
 Prior to that, 254 peons were stationed at pm's residence during the tenure of the Prime Minister of Pakistan
 arthvyavastha ko durust karne kaa agenda dene vaale imran khan ne yah bhi saaf kar diya he ki sarkari khajaane ko majboot karne ke liye vah pradhanmantri ke kafile main tainaat darjanon bulatopruf gadiyon kaa istemaal nahin karenge
 At the same time, dozens of these bulletproof vehicles will be auctioned and that money will be deposited in the government treasury
 khasbaat he ki pakistan abhi bhi aatankwaad ke saae main he or sheersh padon par baithe log aae din aatanki hamalon kaa shikaar hote rahe hai
 In such a situation, is Imran Khan's decision right for his safety? On this question, Imran Khan claims that he wants to give a clear message to the people of Pakistan that he is going to live a simple life that can save the country's money and take an initiative to eradicate poverty from Pakistan
 ise padhein: formula bharat kaa, model china kaa, aise 'nayaa pakistan' banaaenge imran khaniske alaava imran khan ne apane new pakistan kii pariklpana par ek baar phir duniyabar main faile pakistani nagarikon se apil kii ki vah bad chadhakar pakistan main nivesh karen jisase badalte vaishvik parivesh main pakistan ek ahm mukaam hasil kar sake
 Imran Khan also appealed to the rich sections and businessmen of Pakistan that a strong Pakistan can be built only when people start paying taxes with honesty
 ise padhein: kangaal pakistan, videshi karj kaa badhata boj, kaise arthvyavastha ko ubaarenge imran khan?gauratlab he ki pakistan main mahaj 1 fisadi janata inakam tex bharti he or iske chalate sarkaar ko prati varsh ek bada ghaataa uthaanaa padataa he
 Imran Khan said that people should take the task of filling tax as a jihad to build a new Pakistan

 The party says that whatever poster they want to put up, the party is not interested in it
 tejpratap yadav ne fasebuk par likhe apane post ko bijepi or jediu kii sajeesh bataaya tha
 JDU says on this why they do not complain in cyber cell
 keval gumraah karne se kaam nahin chalane vaala
 It is worth mentioning that Kitej Pratap Yadav took out his anger on the party and family from his Facebook account on Monday evening
 lekin kuch hi ghante baad unhone you turn liya or kaha ki unka acount hack ho gaya tha
 JDU spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan says that Tej Pratap is busy trying to remain in the media for some reason or the other
 unke andar asuraksha kaa bhav he
 Because his younger brother got more importance in the family, he also has a great status in politics
 isliye wo kuntha unke andar he
 Rajiv Ranjan said, through such statements, he has also been expressing that frustration
 is liye hamaari party ko na unki 'no entry' main dilchaspee or na unke 'no entry' ko hataane main dilchaspee he
 Because now the condition of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) is not good
 nitish kumaar ji ke nikalne ke baad mahagathbandhan ab rajd bandhan batch gaya he
 With this bond, there is some splash inside the Congress
 vah chaahe jitna bhi koshish kar len janata ko vah bargala nahin paaenge
 Rajeev Ranjan said, if Tej Pratap feels that his account has been hacked then he should complain under cybercrime
 isaki jaanch hogi or yah sach he to jo bhi apradhi honge vah pakade jaaenge
 But we believe that this is a lie
 logon ko gumraah karne ke liye wo acount ko hack karne kii baat kar rahe hai
 Tejapratap said that he will make a case but when he will, he does not tell anything about it

 There have been many big reasons behind bjp's Assam win under Sarbananda Sonowal
 inamen se pramukh 10 kaaran hai-1 
 Like Bharosadilly or Bihar on bjp's local leadership, bjp's central leadership did not forget to overtake the local leadership this time
 sthaneey netaa sarbanand sonoval jaise netaa ne hichunaav prachaar abhiyaanko sambhala
 The work done with his deep knowledge and understanding about the state showed its impact

 There was no news of any infighting in the party in Assam like Delhi or Bihar assembly elections
 sarbanand sonoval ke saath milakar hemanth vishwasharma ne rajya bhar main chunaav prachaar kiya
 Although he was said to be angry with the central leadership, it was falsified

 bjp's emphasis on local issuesbjp leadership kept its focus on local issues in the election campaign
 netaaon ne garibi, bijli kii kami, vikaas or rojgaar ke mudde ko hi aage rakhkar gogoi sarkaar ko gherne kii koshish kii
 PM Modi also made promises in his speech to address the current problems of Assam
 4
 Anti-incumbency against the Gogoi government: Anti-incumbency was also working among the common people against the Congress government which had been continuing for 15 years
 prachaar abhiyaan main congress netaa kuch nayaa nahin kar paae
 The anger of the people was stirred and there was no improvement in the attitude of the Congress

 Compared to the old leadership of the Congress, the leadership of the Congress was in the hands of CM Tarun Gogoi for 15 years
 vah kaaphi umradraj hai or piem modi ne apane bhaashanon main ise mudda bhi banaaya tha
 At the same time, the leadership of the BJP was in the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the names of Sarbananda Sonowal and Congress rebel Himanta Viswasharma

 This again proved to be true in the election of Assam

 The support of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and its allied organizations is seen as a big factor here, like every time in the bjp's victory

 sadhvi yon shoshan maamle main doshi paae gaye gurmeet ram rahim ke upar sirf yahi ek maamla nahin he
 He has been accused by many people
 aise hi ek aapraadhik maamle main gurmeet ram rahim ko 7 sitambar ko jaipur ke magistrate court main bhi pesh hona he
 Actually, Gurmeet is accused of missing a man's wife
 ji haa, ram rahim ke khilaaf jaipur main bhi maamla darj he
 On 5 May 2015, a person named Kamlesh filed a complaint in the court
 pariwaad main usne bataaya tha ki wo or uski patni ram rahim ke sirsa ashram main jate the
 But his wife is imprisoned there
 court ne jaipur ke jawahar nagar thane ko mukadmaa darj kar uski patni ko pesh karne ke liye kaha tha
 An FIR was lodged against Ram Rahim at Jawahar Nagar police station on 8 May 2015
 jisamen police ab tak jaanch nahi kar pai he
 The police have written an answer in their progress report that Kibaba is not getting permission to go to the camp
 deraa pramukh ke khilaaf kai aapraadhik maamle darj hai
 In this case, the court has summoned all the parties to the court on September 7, where the testimony of Kamlesh, a complainant, is also to be testified
 jaipur ke jagatpur ke manhorpur main rahane vaale kamalesh raigar ne rajasthan hoicourt main habiyas carpus lagaai gai thi ki wo apni patni 26 saal kii guddi devi or apane bacchon ke saath ram rahim ke sirsa ke dere main gaya tha
 From 23 to 25 March 2015, Voram was in Rahim's ashram, but the incharge Datta took his wife to meet Ram Rahim, since then his wife could not be found and now he is stepping out of the ashram on asking about the dera's wife
 uske baad court ne rajasthan ke dijipi se kamalesh kii patni ko court main pesh karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 But if the police could not succeed in presenting him in the court, then the magistrate court ordered three people, including Ram Rahim, to be given permission

 He also fed me, when asked, he told that the Congress was left behind by just three seats from BJP
 isi vajah se wo bahut khush he
 The same situation is with most Congressmen who are more happy that the BJP lost the election
 unhen shaayad is baat se koi fark nahin padataa he chunaavon main unka supada saaf ho gaya he
 The condition is that it is not being discussed much from TV to newspaper
 aisa bhi shaayad pehali baar hua he ki congress ne sari siton par chunaav ladaa ho or sari siten haar gai
 That too when the Congress was ruling here a year ago, that too for 15 consecutive years
 haar bhi maamuli nahin
 In 70 of the 70 assembly seats, Congress' bail was forfeited
 sirf chaar siton par congress duusare number par rahi
 Congress candidate for the post of Chief Minister Ajay Maken received only 16,331 votes in Sadar Bazar seat while winner AAP candidate Som Dutt received 67,507 votes

 3 percent and Congress 9
 7 fisadi hi vot mili hai
 BJP 33 in the last assembly elections
 3 fisadi, aap ko 29
 7 percent and Congress 24
 7 fisadi vot mili the
 One thing is very clear from these figures that a large vote bank of Congress has completely gone to AAP
 keval congress hi nahin bispi ko bhi is baar dilli main 1
 It has got 3 percent votes, while it got 5 last time
 35 fisadi vot mili the
 The poll survey also played a big role in the defeat of the Congress
 alag alag survey main congress ko mahaj ek se teen seat milti dikhaai gai thi
 There was such a message among the voters that to vote for the Congress against the BJP is to destroy its vote
 lihaaja aise votaron ne aap kaa daaman thaman liya
 It is clear that this bell of danger is more for other parties than BJP
 bijepi ke netaa narendra modi or aap netaa arvind kejariwal donon congress mukt bharat kii baat karte hai
 The Congress has been uniting all the opposition in the name of being secular
 agar vahi vipaksh ab kejariwal ke peeche aa jaae to phir congress kahaan jaaegi
 So the crisis is more for the Congress
 der ab bhi nahin hui he
 If the Congress really wants to treat the merger, then there is no shortage of opportunities because Modi at the Center and now Kejriwal in Delhi
 isliye uske paas sajag vipaksh kii bhoomika nibhaane kaa maidan puri tarah se khaali padaa he
 Then the place will be built again

 While there is enthusiasm in the Congress camp due to Rahul's arrival, there is also a small lack of feeling
 rahul gandhi is baar jamini kaaryakartaaon se nahin milenge
 Uttarakhand Congress President Pritam Singh termed the program of Rahul Gandhi as brief, saying that even though this time the leader of his national leadership command lacks time, but after the rainy season is over, we will request him that once Come to Devbhoomi to meet Congress workers again and encourage everyone, so that in the coming elections, the Congress with full power in the elections Win gauratlab he kibhajapa keshirsh netritv ne abhi se 2019 ke chunaavon kii taiyaari shuru karte hue desh bhar main bhraman kii shuruyaat kar di he or bhaajapa ke rashtri adhyaksh amit shah lagaataar dauron par hai jahaan wo har din apane jamini kaaryakartaaon kaa utsahvardhan karne main lage rahete hai
 He continues to work on his strategy non-stop, in such a situation that if Rahul Gandhi also met his grassroots workers after facing a bad defeat in Uttarakhand, then the faction of the Congress camp would have ended and there would have been a flow of enthusiasm among the workers
 
 vyaktigat kaarykram ke baad agar congress rashtriya upaadhyaksh aadhe ghante kaa samay bhi apane kaaryakartaaon ko dete to aapasi gutbandi ko shant karne main kuch had tak safalataa unako jarur mil sakati thi

 In her post, the 89-year-old woman did not write much about all the pleasant aspects of her life, but has said some things regarding the time spent together after her husband retires
 bujurg mahila likhti hai ki ritairement ke baad na vah kabhi khaali baithe or na main
 We are always doing something
 khaas baat yah thi ki ham jo bhi karte saath saath karte or ek duusare ke saath or pyaar ko puri tarah jite
 She writes that we would paint to decorate the house, put up decorations, sit in the evening watching TV, and even cook food together
 vah bataati hai ki unke pati ko sabase zyada kuch pasand tha to shaam ke samay evening walk par janaa or vah bhi lambii walk par jate the
 In the post, remembering her days, she says that whenever we were together, she used to hold my hand
 khaskar vah hameshaa is baat kaa dhyaan jab bhi ham sadak paar karen vah meraa haath jarur pakaden or tabhi chhodte the jab ham sadak puri tarah paar kar lete
 This love of both of them lasted till her husband died
 apni post main mahila ne bataaya he ki 12 saal pehle ek raat unke pati jab soye to vah soye hi rah gaye
 Describing the agony of her mind, the elderly woman wrote that she wanted to spend more time with them and still wants to
 sabase dardanaak or dil ko chune vaali baat is bujurg mahila ne likhte hue kaha ki main aaj bhi apane ko vyast rakhti hum
 i go to my daughter's house to have lunch and dinner, and whenever i get the chance, i attend some public events too, but now everything is not the same, i have a lot of trouble today
 iske baad is mahila ne vah baat kahi jise vah apane pati ko bataanaa to chaahati thi, lekin unke jinda rahete yah kah nahin pai
 If you are an emotional person, then maybe your eyes become moist and your throat gets filled
 vah likhti hai ki ab 89 saal kii umr main, main yah kah sakati hum ki maine ek behatar jindagi ji he, or mujhe kabhi kisi baat se dar nahin laga
 Except for one thing that i have never been able to say to my husband that i am afraid to cross the road

 The elderly woman writes that after retirement, he never sat empty nor did I
 ham hameshaa kuch na kuch karte rahete
 The special thing was that whatever we do together, we will live together and love each other more fully
 ve likhti hai ki ham ghar ko sajaane ke liye paint karte, sajaavat kaa saamaan lagaate, shaam ko saath baithkar tivi dekhte, or yahaan tak ki khaanaa bhi saath pakaate
 She says that her husband loved something more then going to Evening Walk in the evening and he also used to go on long walks
 apane un dinon ko yaad karte hue post main vah bataati hai ki jab bhi ham saath hote vah meraa haath thamkar chalate the
 Especially, he always noticed that whenever we cross the road, he would definitely hold my hand and leave only when we crossed the road completely
 donon kaa yah pyaar bharaa saath tab tak chalaa jab tak unke pati kaa dehanth nahin ho gaya
 In her post, the woman has told that when her husband slept one night 12 years ago, he remained asleep
 apane man kii vyathaa ko bataate hue bujurg mahila ne likhaa ki vah unke saath or samay bitaana chaahati thim or ab bhi chaahati hai
 The most painful and heart touching thing this elderly lady wrote while writing that i still keep myself busy

 After this, this woman said what she wanted to tell her husband, but could not say while they were alive
 aap yadi bhavuk insaan hai to shaayad aapaki ankhen bhi nam ho jaaen or galaa bhar aae
 She writes that now at the age of 89, i can say that i have lived a better life, and i have never been afraid of anything
 sirf ek baat ko chhodkar jo main kabhi apane pati se nahin kah pai ki mujhe sadak paar karne main dar lagata he
 i still need his help in crossing the road

 ravivaar ko ek press conference main akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki agar bhabhi ne chote bhaaiyon se kaha ki aapaki shikaayat bhaiya se karengi to galat kya kaha
 Actually, there was a huge crowd during Dimple Yadav's rally in Allahabad
 jisase pareshaan hokar dimple ne kaha tha ki is maahaul se dar lagata he
 Smriti Irani and Mayawati had targeted him, citing the state's security system
 ullekhneey he ki beete 20 farvari ko elahabaad main dimpal kii sabha main bheed bekaabu ho gai thi
 a person was taking a photo of them, on which Dimple Yadav said that i will complain to your brother

 The comments yahi nahin dimple ke bayaan par basapa ke poster ko lekar bhi akhilesh kaaphi gusse main dikhaai die
 He said that tell Bua ji, if there is any problem then you can call 1090 anytime

 But the plan seems to be over in a few months
 jin pariwaron ko ye gaayen mili hai, unki ab phikr he ki wo gaayon ko kya khilaaen or khud kya khaaen
 They say that there is a danger of their remaining farmland being sold to raise these cows
 thama di gayi biimaar gaayen, timaardaari main hi nikal rahaa damarajy main har bipiel parivaar ko 90 fisadi sabsidi par 6-6 maheene ke antaraal par do gaay uplabdh karai jaani thim
 It was claimed that these cows would give 10 to 15 liters of milk every day, which would provide financial support to BPL families
 lekin ab kai pariwaron kaa aarope he ki unhenbimaar gaythma di gayi
 These cows are only giving 2 to 3 liters of milk a day
 aise main in pariwaron kaa gaayon ko khilaane main hi unka dam nikal rahaa he
 The cost of over-curing of sick cows has come to a different head
 afasaron or bichauliyon ne kiye karodon ke vaare-nyaare!sarkaar kii ore se is yojana ke liye 12 arab rupee kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya
 In this, 45 thousand rupees were fixed for each cow and 15 thousand rupees for a living shed

 In Ranchi alone, this cow was to be distributed to one and a half thousand families

 jaipur kii purv meyar jyoti khandelwal ne kaha ki pratyaksh chunaav karana behatar he, kyonki pratyaksh chunaav ke jariye janpratidhi zyada javabdeh hote hai or unamem zyada aatmavishvaas bhi aata he
 Pilot may be calling his point of view a matter of principles, but many leaders believe that this infighting within the Congress has given the Opposition a chance to muddy the image of the government and the Congress

 The Congress and NCP have been facing difficulties since the bjp-shiv Sena alliance won 41 out of 48 seats during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 chunki maharashtra main saal ke aakhir main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 In such a situation, the exercise of tightening the loose screws of the coalition in time has intensified from both the parties
 magar maamla siton ke bantwaare ko lekar funs gaya he
 On June 29, at the residence of Congress President Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi, Maharashtra Pradesh Congress President Ashok Chavan arrived
 is dauraan unhone vidhansabha chunaav main ensipi se gathbandhan par baatcheet kii
 Later Ashok Chavan confirmed that the meeting was discussed with the NCP to finalize the alliance, but also said that there was no seat-sharing
 congress ke pradesh adhyaksh chavaan ne vanchit bahujan aghadi party ke saath gathambadhan ke liye vikalp khule hone kii baat bhi kahi
 Sources are telling that to counter the bjp-shiv Sena alliance, the congress-ncp is preparing to join not only Bahujan Aghadi but also Raj Thackeray's MNS
 raaj thakare se ensipi mukhiya sharad pavaar or maharashtra ke purv congress adhyaksh manikrav thakare kii haalia mulakaaton ko gathbandhan se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 What is stuck? Sources are telling that Congress always fought more seats in the face of alliance with NCP in Maharashtra till now
 magar haalia loksabhaa chunaav main congress kii tulana main ensipi ne acha pradarshan kiya
 The Congress could win only 1 seat by contesting 26 Lok Sabha seats, while the NCP, which contested 22 seats, managed to win 4 seats
 ek seat ovaisi kii party ko mili to ek anya nirdal ke khate main gai
 The bjp-shiv Sena won the other 41 seats
 sutron kaa kahana he ki loksabhaa chunaav main congress ke ek ke mukaable 4 siten jeetne vaali ensipi gathbandhan main badi haisiyat main aana chaahati he
 The ncp's demand for more seats has made Congress uncomfortable
 isliye loksabhaa ke baad ab vidhansabha chunaav main bhi gathbandhan lagbhag final ho jane ke baavjood ab tak siton kaa bantwaaraa nahin ho sakaa he
 Till now Congress has played the role of elder brother in the alliance
 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress ne 42 or ensipi ne 41 siten jeetin thim
 If sources are to be believed, the NCP argues that the Congress' base in Maharashtra has been steadily slipping
 aise main gathbandhan kii haalat main ensipi congress ke mukaable 21 na sahi to 19 bhi nahin rahanaa chaahati
 What will happen in Rahul and Supriya? Youth leadership roles in Congress and NCP have strengthened over time
 pehle donon dalon main gathbandhan ko lekar baatcheet sonia gandhi or sharad pavaar ke bich hoti thi
 Now, in the Congress, where Rahul Gandhi is on the shoulder of advancing the alliance, Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule in NCP has taken this task in her hand
 sutara bataate hai ki sansad bhawan main gathbandhan ko lekar ensipi saansad supriya sule or congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke bich charchaa ho chuki he

 One Hindu is attacking another Hindu

 Question: Is this not an attack on Dalits? Prakash Ambedkar: It is not a question of cast identity but is attacking with religious identity
 isamen cast angal kii baat nahin he
 Question: Some people are calling it Maratha versus Dalit? Prakash Ambedkar: There is no such thing
 jo samudaayon ko aapas main bhidwana chaahate hai, baantnaa chaahate hai, ve aisa bataa rahe honge
 The cast end should not be seen in it

 Neither these organizations call the RSS their own nor the rss's
 ab jo is tarah ke updravi hindutvvaadi sanghathan hai jo kathith taur par hinduon kii baat karte hai, unako lekar ab tamaam hinduon ko sochna he ki aise logon ko ‘hafiz said’ hone dena he yaa nahin hone dena he

 ab bhaajapa ko isamen nirnay lenaa he ki unhen ‘hafiz said’ chahie yaa nahin chahie
 If 'hafid Saeed' is not wanted, arrest Sambhaji and present him in court

 They were coming to greet their forefathers
 ab ve sabhi puche rahe hai ki kya ve apane purakhon kaa abhivadan bhi nahin kar sakate? sarkaar ab unke liye kuch nahin kar rahi he to unke man main to gussa he hi
 We have just pacified them after the bandh on January 3, but the fire keeps on burning
 ab kab bhadak jaae maaloom nahin, yah sarkaar par nirbhar karata he
