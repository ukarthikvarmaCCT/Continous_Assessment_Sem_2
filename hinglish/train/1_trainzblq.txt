If you control the percentage of calories in your diet and take fix and healthy diet for this, then there is good news for you
 aise log feet to rahete hai hi saath hi unki sex life bhi diet control nahin kar paane waalon kii tulana main acchhee hoti he
 According to a study, low and healthy eaters not only stay fit but also have good mood
 acchhee diet lene se tension control karne main bhi madad milti he
 In this way, having a good mood and no tension makes sex life better
 louiciana ke pennington biomedical research centre ke shodhakartaaon ne 218 healdi tinegers par adhyayan ke baad ye nattejey die hai
 People were divided into two groups for this study
 ek group ko 25 percent kam calories lene ko kaha gaya or duusare group ko normal diet hi lene ko kaha gaya
 Researcher Corby Martin says that the group that consumed fewer calories had a comparatively better sex life
 itnaa hi nahin unki neend bhi acchhee hui or vajan bhi kam hua
 Research has said that if obese people control their diet then their sleep and sex life can be improved
 ye study jama internal medicine jarnal main prakashit kii gai he
 Research has said that if healthy people eat low calorie food for two years, it will result in the opposite for them
 ye niyam keval mote logon ke liye hi effective he

 This will reduce weight quickly and make sex life smooth
 yah prabhaav purushon kii apeksha mahilaon main zyada dekhne ko mila he
 The reason behind this research, published in the Journal of Social Influence, is that women care more about what others are thinking about them while eating
 isliye wo kam khaati hai or calories control karti hai

 maharashtra main congress agar prakaash ambedkar kii party vanchit bahujan aghadi (vibie) se gathbandhan kar leti to kam se kam 6 siten upie kii jholii main hotin
 The Congress-led UPA had NCP and self-respecting parties
 lekin prakaash ambedkar ke saath unka siton par samjhauta nahin ho paaya
 As a result, the deprived Bahujan Aghadi tied up with Asaduddin Owaisi's party AIMIM on 48 seats in the state
 haalanki ye gathbandhan sirf 1 seat jeetne main kaamyaab rahaa
 But it damaged the UPA across the state
 rajya kii 6 aisi siten thim, jahaan vanchit bahujan aghadi ne upie ummidavaaron ko nuksaan pahunchaaya or unke vot agar jud jate to bijepi candidet kii haar hoti
 This list also includes the Nanded seat of former Chief Minister Ashok Chavan, where the candidate of the Bahujan Aghadi, who is underprivileged, has 1
 23 lakh vot mili jabaki chavaan lagbhag 40 hajaar voton se haare
 Similarly, in the gadchiroli-chimur Lok Sabha, the UPA candidate lost by about 77 thousand votes
 yahaan bhi prakaash ambedkar kii party ko 1 lakh se zyada vot mili
 In Sangli, the underprivileged Bahujan Aghadi candidate got around 25 per cent votes, which was only 44 thousand less than the UPA candidate
 agar yahaan unka samjhauta hota to endie ummidavaar ko achche khaase antar se haraa sakate the
 The special thing is that Prakash Ambedkar, the grandson of Dalit leader Bhimrao Ambedkar and the president of the deprived Bahujan Aghadi, contested from two places Akola and Solapur
 lekin donon siton se unhen haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 However, he stood second in Akola
 upie kaa ummidavaar tisare paaydaan par aayaa
 Looking at these figures, it is clear that if the UPA had compromised with Ambedkar, the situation would have been different
 na to upie sirf 5 siton par simatati or na hi bijepi shivasena gathbandhan 41 siton par jeetta
 Prakash Ambedkar announced the deprived Bahujan Aghadi in March 2018, although he registered the party a year before the Lok Sabha elections

 Repo is the rate at which the central bank lends cash to banks for their immediate needs

 RBI Governor Rajan, while releasing the second bi-monthly monetary policy for 2014-15 here, said it would be appropriate to keep the policy interest rates unchanged at present and allow the deflationary effects of interest rate hikes between September 2013-january 2014 to work

 Rajan, who has raised the repo rates thrice in the past, said that there will be no need to increase interest rates further if this trend of reduction in inflation continues
 unhone kaha ki yadi mudrasphiti main kami kii prakriya anumaan se adhik teji se hui to arabiai byaaj daron main bhi katautee par bhi vichaar kar saktaa he
 Rajan is aiming to bring retail inflation to eight per cent by January 2015 and six per cent a year later

 Be glad that there are elections in Karnataka, otherwise the price of petrol would have gone up to Rs 90
 pichley 13 dinon se petrol or deazal ke daam nahin bad rahe hai jabaki antarrashtriya bazaaron main kachche tel kaa daam badhata hi ja rahaa he
 How is this magic happening? Whereas last June, the government said that henceforth oil companies will fix the price according to the daily price
 khub tarif hui
 Inside it was said that if something continues to grow everyday, the public will not know
 bijness standard ke shin jaikab kii pehali story aap pard lijiega
 Sources in the industry have written that the price increase was not allowed even in the Gujarat elections, due to the Karnataka elections
 yani roj daam tay karne kii azaadi bakawaas he
 Prices are still increasing according to the government
 sochie agar is dauraan koi chunaav nahin hota tab petrol kaa daam kahaan tak pahunch gaya hota
 Shine Jacob wrote quoting sources of oil companies that their profit margins are decreasing due to not increasing the price
 1 april ko unka ausat margin prati litre 3 rupee tha jo 1 may ko ghat kar do rupee se bhi kam ho gaya he
 The margin decreased by 45 percent
 tel companiyaan kaaphi dabaav main hai
 The government has stopped increasing prices from April 23
 dilli main 74
 63 per liter of petrol and 65
 93 ru prati litre dijal he
 In Mumbai, it has reached 82 rupees per liter
 manaregaa ke lakhon mazaduron ko kaam karne ke baad bhi chah chah maheene se vetan nahin mila he
 See to what extent the media has become anti-people
 kisi mazdoor ko 2000 nahin mila to kisi ko 500
 With this money, what would have been going on them
 unka ghar kaise chalata hoga
 Ideally, there should be an uproar in the country for this
 jis mukhyadhara kii media ke liye aap paise dete hai, usne is tarah kaa kaam lagbhag band kar diya he
 There is a new website named indiaspend, it has done research and has told that the figures of the government itself say that till 1 April 2018, lakhs of MNREGA workers have not received money
 2018-19 ke liye sarkaar ne manaregaa kaa bajet 14
 If we had increased it by 5 percent, then why are the money not being given again? The budget of the government for MNREGA is 55000 crores
 57 pratishat mazaduri kaa bhugtan nahin hua he
 Bank employees are desperate
 paanch saal baad selary badhane kii baari thi magar kuch ata-paat nahin he
 Talks were held between a group of banks' management and an employee union in Mumbai
 is baatcheet main sirf 2 pratishat selary badhaane kaa prastaav diya gaya jisase karmchaaree aahat ho gaye
 2 percent is nothing in this inflation
 yah bataa rahaa he ki bank ab bheetar se charmara gaye hai
 The salary of bank employees is very low
 itani kam ki ve us selary main mahanagar to chhodie kisi kasbe main nahin rah sakate hai
 Many bankers still feel that they had made a national contribution during the time of demonetisation, which should have been rewarded
 aaj na kal unhen sabase pehle yahi samajhnaa hoga ki notebandi kabhi na sabit hone vaala ek gambhir frod tha
 Now the government also does not talk about its benefits
 pradhanmantri bhi isse kinaaraa kar chuke hai
 The same demonetisation has also worsened the condition of banks
 phir bhi bankeron ko jo kaam diya gaya use unhone din raat lagaakar nibhaayaa
 Damages filled with your pocket

 Shine Jacob wrote quoting sources of oil companies that their profit margins are decreasing due to not increasing the price
 1 april ko unka ausat margin prati litre 3 rupee tha jo 1 may ko ghat kar do rupee se bhi kam ho gaya he
 The margin decreased by 45 percent
 tel companiyaan kaaphi dabaav main hai
 The government has stopped increasing prices from April 23
 dilli main 74
 63 per liter of petrol and 65
 93 ru prati litre dijal he
 In Mumbai, it has reached 82 rupees per liter
 manaregaa ke lakhon mazaduron ko kaam karne ke baad bhi chah chah maheene se vetan nahin mila he
 See to what extent the media has become anti-people
 kisi mazdoor ko 2000 nahin mila to kisi ko 500
 With this money, what would have been going on them
 unka ghar kaise chalata hoga
 Ideally, there should be an uproar in the country for this
 jis mukhyadhara kii media ke liye aap paise dete hai, usne is tarah kaa kaam lagbhag band kar diya he
 There is a new website named indiaspend, it has done research and has told that the figures of the government itself say that till 1 April 2018, lakhs of MNREGA workers have not received money
 2018-19 ke liye sarkaar ne manaregaa kaa bajet 14
 If we had increased it by 5 percent, then why are the money not being given again? The budget of the government for MNREGA is 55000 crores
 57 pratishat mazaduri kaa bhugtan nahin hua he
 Bank employees are desperate
 paanch saal baad selary badhane kii baari thi magar kuch ata-paat nahin he
 Talks were held between a group of banks' management and an employee union in Mumbai
 is baatcheet main sirf 2 pratishat selary badhaane kaa prastaav diya gaya jisase karmchaaree aahat ho gaye
 2 percent is nothing in this inflation
 yah bataa rahaa he ki bank ab bheetar se charmara gaye hai
 The salary of bank employees is very low
 itani kam ki ve us selary main mahanagar to chhodie kisi kasbe main nahin rah sakate hai
 Many bankers still feel that they had made a national contribution during the time of demonetisation, which should have been rewarded
 aaj na kal unhen sabase pehle yahi samajhnaa hoga ki notebandi kabhi na sabit hone vaala ek gambhir frod tha
 Now the government also does not talk about its benefits
 pradhanmantri bhi isse kinaaraa kar chuke hai
 The same demonetisation has also worsened the condition of banks
 phir bhi bankeron ko jo kaam diya gaya use unhone din raat lagaakar nibhaayaa
 Damages filled with your pocket
 bagair naitik bal or ekajutata ke aap kuch bhi hasil nahin kar sakate

 Millions of MNREGA workers have not been paid even after six months of work
 media kis had tak janvirohi ho gaya he aap dekhie
 If a worker does not get 2000, some 500
 in paison ke na hone se un par kya biit rahi hogi
 How would their home run
 kaayade se is baat ke liye desh main hangaamaa much janaa chahie
 The mainstream media for which you pay has almost stopped this kind of work
 indiaspend naam kii nai website he, isane research kar bataaya he ki sarkaar ke hi aankade kehete hai ki 1 april 2018 tak lakhon manaregaa mazaduron ko paise nahin mili hai
 Government's MNREGA budget 14 for 2018-19
 5 pratishat badhaayaa tha tab phir paise kyon nahin die ja rahe hai? manaregaa ke liye sarkaar kaa bajet 55000 karod he
 57 percent of the wages have not been paid
 bank karmchaaree maayoos hai
 After five years, it was the turn of salary to increase, but there is no trouble
 mumbai main bainkon ke prabandhan ke samooh or karmchaaree union ke bich baatcheet hui
 In this negotiation, it was proposed to increase salary by only 2 percent, which hurt employees
 is mahangaai main 2 pratishat to kuch nahin
 It is telling that the banks have now gone from within
 bank karmchaariyon kii selary vaaki bahut kam he
 So little that they leave the metropolis in that salary, they cannot live in any town
 abhi bhi kai bankeron ko lagata he ki notebandi ke samay unhone koi rashtriya yogadan diya tha jiskaa inaam milanaa chahie tha
 Nowadays, first of all, they have to understand that demonetisation was a serious fraud
 ab sarkaar bhi iske phaayde kii baat nahin karti he
 The Prime Minister has also avoided it

 Nevertheless, the work given to the bankers was carried out day and night

 Bais said at the state level conference of the State Kurmi Samaj, 'there is no one to raise a voice before us

 The names of Vikram Usendi, MP from tribal category and former minister Ramvichar Netam are going on, while former Assembly Speaker Dharamlal Kaushik from OBC is a strong contender
 kowshik kaa naam pehle number par bataaya ja rahaa he, lekin adivasee varg kii bahulata kaa hawala dekar adivasee adhyaksh kii lobing karne vaala ek prabhaavshaalee tabaka bhi he
 For this reason, Bais's statement may have a direct impact on the appointment of the state president
 bas pradesh bijepi ke corgroup ke pramukh sadasyon main se ek hai
 This is the reason why the political meaning of his statement is also being extracted
 mahatvapurn baat yah he ki bas ne jis manch se yah baat kahi, us par purv vidhansabha adhyaksh kowshik bhi maujuud the
 Bais was presiding over the state level conference of Sarva Kurmi Samaj in the Maharashtra Mandal Hall of the capital

 Bais said, 'I have a minister Ajay Chandrakar from Kurmi Samaj in Chhattisgarh and i am an MP

 So once again questions started to be raised on america-pak-india relations
 rishton kaa yah trikon kisi aatanki network se bhi zyada pechida he
 Let us understand this for 5 global reasons and let us look at the 5 reasons within Pakistan, because of which he repeatedly goes close to America-1
 pakistan kaa bharat se talmail kyon? kyonki uski kai jaruratein zyada phydemand dhang se bharat hi puri kar saktaa he, bajaae america yaa china
 Which he not only has to consider a favor, but also has to fulfill his desired conditions
 2
 Pakistan's inclination towards China? Because the British created an army structure in the country from the point of view of India
 is faujee takat ke saamne pakistan kabhi tik nahin paaya
 Kargil War of 1948, 1965, 1971 or 1999
 hathiyaar or bharat ke saath chale aa rahe proxi war kii jaruraton ke liye use china kaa munh dekhnaa hi padataa he
 And China is also particularly interested in Kashmir
 1962 yuddh ke baad vah bharat par dabaav banane ke liye pakistan se apane rishton kaa istemaal karata rahaa he
 3
 pakistan se hamaare talmail kii jarurat kyon? kyonki isse zyada taqatvar china ke mansoobon ko dhwast karne main aasaani hoti he
 Apart from this, we get a guarantee of peace in our home from normal Pakistan
 or sabase ahm, is rishte kii badaulat hamen afghanistan or iraan se sidhe sampark main suvidha hoti he
 4
 pakistan main america kii majaburi kya? kuch dollar or thodaa saport dikhaakar yadi america ko afghanistan main apana mishan puraa karne main madad milti he to isamen harj kya he
 Afghanistan does not have a border with the sea, so from the ports of Pakistan, America can extend maximum supply to its army in Afghanistan
 afghanistan main uske base ek ore iraan to duusari ore china par dabaav banane main madad karte hai
 5
 bharat or rus ke rishte kaa role? shaantikaal hone ke baavjood duniya main sabase bada kaarobaar hathiyaaron kaa hi he
 And the two biggest players in this industry are America and Russia
 sheet yuddh ke samay bharat kii rus se najdiki rahi
 And the largest supply of arms to our country was also from Russia
 lekin haal ke daur main yah santulan badla he
 In 2013, the United States sold the most arms to India, leaving Russia behind
 1
 Turnover was 19 billion dollars
 jad to pakistan-china se tanaav hi he
 And 5 reasons within Pakistan: - The core of Pakistan's foreign policy rests on Kashmir itself
 uski puri mashinari kashmir maamle ko antarrashtriya banane main juty rahati he
 Political parties are vying for who can redeem the matter better
 aise main har party america kii dosti chaahati he
 - Some organizations of Pakistan and former army officers have been openly helping terrorist organizations
 paise or training donon tarah se
 Pakistan has been calling them non-state actors, but could not take action
 kyonki ye taqatvar, sangathit or khoonkhaar hai
 In such a situation, he has to see the face of America in keeping the image of Pakistan at the international level
 - pakistan kaa samaaj teen hisson banta hua he, kisi bhi anya desh ke ucch, madhyam or nimna varg kii tarah
 But in Pakistan, corrupt leaders, army officers and big vassals come in the upper class
 punjab se lekar karachi tak inaki hukumat puraane jamaane ke raajaaon kii tarah hi he
 The middle class with service class is slowly emerging, but it is not as powerful as the middle class of India
 or teesraa or antim nimna varg yahaan bahut hi buree haalat main he
 Like slaves in Punjab and Sindh
 jabaki pashchimi ilaakon main jaanwaron se bhi badtar
 - The role of Pakistani army in the country's politics also takes him closer to America
 vah satta par dabaav banaae rakhana chaahati he or siyasatdan sena se khud kii khayr manaane ke liye america se rahanumai chaahate hai
 - and finally corruption of power
 is par america congress kii hi report kahati he ki pakistan ke netaa or sena america se madad maangati rahi hai or phir us dollar se unhone apana bank balance badhaayaa yaa bharat ke khilaaf istemaal kiya
 People who have a rich intake of vitamin and omega 3 fatty acids in their diet have a lower risk of brain contraction
 mastishk sankuchan yaa dimag kii sikudna alzimer rog se judaa hua he

 kul sahabhaagiyon main se 42 kaa mastishk vistaar maapne ke liye emarai scan bhi kiya gaya
 According to the results of the study, participants were found to have good nutritional status but seven percent found vitamin B12 and 25 percent vitamin d deficiency

 US President Donald Trump surprised the world of Islam by starting his first foreign tour to Saudi Arabia
 saudi arab main yojit pehali 'arab islamic america summit' main jute 55 muslim deshon ke netaaon ko trump ne islam par pravachan bhi diya
 Also gave a message of peace
 isse logon ko lagane laga tha ki trump kaa islam or musalamaanon ke prati najariya badal gaya he
 Although he had not yet returned from his first foreign tour, preparations have begun to fight the last battle to ban Muslim countries
 isse saaf ho gaya he ki saudi main trump kaa muslim prem mahaj ek dikhaava he
 Shortly after assuming the office of US President, Trump had banned the entry of citizens of Neiran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen into the US
 is faisle kii duniya bhar main kadi aalochana hui thi or maamle main adaalat ko dakhal dena padaa tha
 Even then, the Trump administration did not agree and appealed in the Federal Court against the lower court of America
 brihaspativaar ko fedral apil court ne maamle main nichali adaalat ke faisle ko barkaraar rakhte hue trump ke bain lagane vaale kaaryakari aadesh ke khilaaf faisla sunaaya
 After Trump's recent visit to Saudi and preaching to the heads of Muslim countries there, it was believed that Trump's attitude towards Muslims had changed, but the opposite was true
 aaj bhi trump sarkaar kaa najariya jas kaa tas he
 Therefore, the Trump administration has decided to challenge the Federal Court's order to ban Muslim countries in the US top court
 atorni general jeff seshans ne kaha he ki fedral court ke faisle ke khilaaf yues supreme court main apil kii jaaegi
 What did the US Appeal Court say? The US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the US lower court's ruling 10-3 against the ban on Muslim countries
 pehali apiliy adaalat ne kaha ki yah bain samvidhan kaa ulanghan karata he
 The Trump administration argued that the decision was taken keeping national security in mind, but the court rejected it outright
 maaloom ho ki trump ne march main iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria or yaman ke nagarikon ke america main pravesh par pratibandh laga diya tha
 Trump's Muslim love was only a surprise for Muslims, not just the Islamic world, but also the American people, who were suddenly spewing venom against a pretentious Muslim president
 trump ke is badale rukh par kisi ko yakeen nahin ho rahaa tha
 Experts were skeptical of Trump's alleged change, which is once again being proven true
 unka kahana tha ki trump ke muslim prem ke peeche swaarth chipa hua he
 They are misleading the world by expressing Muslim love, in contrast to their stand to save their power and divert the attention of the people from the Russia dispute

 The trailer of Kangana Ranot and Imran Khan's film 'katti Batti' has been released on Sunday
 launch hone ke kuch ghanton ke bheetar trailor twitor par chaa gaya
 Kangana's name in the film is Payal and Emraan will be seen in Maddy's role
 paayal or madi paanch saal tak liv in relationships main rahane ke baad brake ap kar lete hai
 Watching the trailer, its climax feels a bit predictable
 lekin climex ke raste film main dher sari uthaa patake or dhooma dhadaake kii ummid laga sakate hai
 By the way, the filmmakers have given warning in the trailer itself
 Kipayal and Maddy's madcap story is not a story
 to phir kahani he kya? iske liye film kii relies yani 18 sitambar tak kaa intjaar karnaa padegaa
 Watch the trailer of the film 'katti Batti' manmohan singh ke baad ab videshi patrika ne congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 The London magazine The Economist quoted the Indian journalist's book as saying that the Crown Prince of Congress was Confused
 congress ke mahasachiv rahul gandhi kaa zikr hote hi congress party ke yuvaraj kaa cheharaa ubharne lagata he
 a person who can lead the party in 2014
 ek aisa naam jiske sahare congress aage kii raajnneetik naiya ko khena chaahati he
 But many questions have started to arise on this recognition of the expectations of the Congress
 sawaal unki kaabiliyat ko lekar, sawaal unki samaj ko lekar, sawaal unki nitiyon ko lekar
 Is there no effect of hauling soil in the villages? Is playing with children like this not connecting them to people? Is food being ineffective among Dalits? Does Rahul's speech not appeal to the common people? Are Rahul Confused strongly attacking opponents? All these questions are being raised today because The Economist, an English magazine has published some very different things about Rahul Gandhi
 baaten aisi jo rahul gandhi kii raajnneetik samajhadaari par hi sawaal khadey kar rahi hai
 Things that are making Rahul Gandhi's ability in the dock
 da iconomist ne apane lekh main hawala diya he ek bhartiya lekhika aarti ramchandran kii ek kitaab kaa
 The foreign magazine claims that the basis of what she is writing is Aarti Ramachandran's new book 'decoding Rahul Gandhi'
 aarti kii kitaab ke aadhaar par da iconomist ne likhaa he, 'kitaab ke mutabik, aisa saaf lagata he ki brands rahul puri tarah se canafujd he
 a person who has all kinds of facilities, who stands out only because of his family, seems to be struggling to make his point effective
 'da iconomist ke tir rahul gandhi ke liye or bhi hai
 The magazine finds weakness in every strategy of Rahul
 patrika main ye jor dekar likhaa gaya he ki samasya ye he, 'rahul gandhi ne ab tak rajaneta ke taur par koi badi samajhadaari nahin dikhaai he
 Neither do they have an appetite for responsibilities
 wo sharmile hai
 They do not want to talk to journalists
 naa hi sansad main apni aawaaj buland karte hai
 No one can understand what he is capable of
 andeh iskaa bhi he ki rahul gandhi khud bhi apane aap ko samaj paa rahe hai
 Obviously, this is the first time any magazine has targeted Rahul
 lekin pehle pradhanmantri or ab rahul gandhi, congress ke do bade netaaon par ek ke baad ek aise hamale congress ke liye chintaa ke sabab to hai hi

 bainkon or atm ke baahar lambii line aap nahin bhuule honge
 Everything was stalled by the scarcity of cash
 sarkaar ne notebandi lagu karne ke peeche ek makasad dikhaaya tha kaale dhan ko khatm karne kaa or ek ummid jataai thi ki digital hoga india

 Cash trend has not been finished, the cash seller says that most of the customers are now paying through Paytm, but have not reached the grocery stores other means of online payment
 dukandaar kaa maananaa he ki notebandi ke baad kai graahak ab petm jaise getwe kaa istemaal karne to lage hai lekin cash kaa chalan khatm nahin ho paaya he

 This rickshawk does not know about any other payment method other than cash
 digital india kaa sapana garib rickshaw vaale ke saamne dam tod rahaa he
 We thought of riding an e-rickshaw instead of a cycle rickshaw as it has become more popular in the capital
 or ho saktaa he ki rickshaw vaale ke paas online bhugtan ke duusare madhyam se digital bhugtan ho sake
 The e-rickshaws also said in two words that if they take money, they will take cash

 medical store vaale kaa jawaab yah bhi tha ki unke yahaan zyaadaatar log ab card se bhugtan karne lage hai or cash vaale graahakon kii sankhya main kami ai he
 Delhi is far away for Digital India! 1 year of demonetisation has passed, but despite this 1 year time, even if the government makes claims of Digital India, its implementation at the ground level is still far away
 kyonki zyaadaatar log or unki rosemara kii jaruratein phir se cash kii patari par laut ai hai
 That is to say, Delhi is far away to clear India from cash

 care retigs kii report main iti sector main 20 pratishat kii vruddhi he, lekin 19 aktubar yani aaj ke bijness standard main ek report chhapi he, jiske anusaar iti sector main naukariyaan bahut to nahin, magar kam ho rahi hai
 Three Business Standard correspondents from Ahmedabad, Pune and Mumbai have filed reports that jobs in engineering colleges are coming down and there is no jump in salary
 bijness standard kii report ke anusaar, ai tii sector main pichley saal ke mukaable is saal campus kii naukariyon main 20 pratishat tak kii giravat aa sakati he
 For the last six years, the basic offer in the IT sector has been around 3 to 3
5 lakh per year
 mid level ke ejineering kalejon main isi selary par zyaadaatar ko naukari milti he
 According to this, there is negative growth in salary
 ek kaaran yah bhi he ki bazaar main bahut badi taadaad main ejeeniyar ho gaye hai
 Hence, there is no increase in his initial salary in the last six years
 yani chah saal pehle koi ejeeniyar teen lakh par naukari paata he, chah saal baad kaa batch bhi isi vetan par jwine karata he, jabaki in chah saalon main collejon kii fees or padhai kaa karcha kitna guna bad gaya hoga
 Business Standard has spoken to the placement cells of many colleges that there is no shortage of companies coming to the campus, but the number of jobs is estimated to be low
 pehle companiyaan chaar logon ko naukari par rakhti thim, to ab do logon ko rakh rahi hai
 90 percent of companies are paying the same salary as last year
 bijness standard kii report main head hunter india ke chairman kris lakshmikant kaa bayaan chapa he ki infosis, wipro or tisies jaisi chotii kii teen companiyaan har saal do lakh nae ejiniyaron ko naukari par rakhti thim, lekin ab yah sankhya ghatakar 70 se 80 hazaar ho gai he
 The reason for this is that banking, finance sector and insurance sector have come to a standstill
 vahaan se in iti companiyon ko bijness nahin mil rahaa he, lekin menuphaccharing or saarvajanik kshetra kii companiyon main naukariyaan bad sakati hai
 If you look at the statistics of care ratings
 
 
 2015 main menuphaccharing sector main naukariyon main vruddhi dar -5
 2 percent has been recorded
 banking sector main pichley saal maatr 2
 1 percent
 menuphaccharing sector main naukariyon main vruddhi kii kisi bhi sankhya ko hamen -5
 Have to look at the ratio of 2 percent only
 ek or baat kaa dhyaan rakhiyegaa ki ye saare aankade sarkari nahin hai
 There are different research agencies

 One third of the working population is useless
 68 fisadi kaamgaar pariwaron kii masik kamai 10,000 se adhik nahin he
 Imagine 68 per cent of people earning only 10,000 rupees a month, but who is debating where the procession of the Taj comes from and where the idol immersion procession takes place
 masjid ke saamne laudspikar baje yaa mandir kii aarti ke samay ajaan
 Has any leader sought to increase jobs, or has anyone claimed
 lekin akhbaar range hai is baat se ki ram mandir banegaa yaa ayodhya main musium banegaa
 Subodh Verma has written that the Labor Bureau in its new survey
 
 
 april se lekar disambar 2015 ke bich ek lakh saath hazaar pariwaron main saat lakh assi hazaar se adhik logon ko shaamil kiya he
 The population of workers above 15 years of age in India is close to 45 crores
 is 45 karod main se do karod tees lakh log berojgaar hai
 Those who are getting work do not get work throughout the year
 ise under emloypaint kii catagori main rakhaa gaya he, isaki sankhya 16 karod he
 There are 16 crore people who do not get work throughout the year
 kya vaaki itani gambhir sthiti he
 Can today's young man who needs a job sit at home on assurances that by 2025 or 30 jobs will start growing

 isi kabje ke baad college main sir kati laashon kaa sach saamne aayaa
 Those killed were innocent people who refused to support ISIS and were held hostage by ISIS
 kaha ja rahaa he ki jab iraqi fouj ke shahar main ghus aane kii khabar aatankwaadiyon ko mili tabhi unhone bhaagane se pehle bandhakh banaae sabhi sau logon ke sir kaat die
 So far, the situation has become so fragile for 900 terrorists in the war of ISIS, it can be gauged from the fact that on one hand these terrorists, Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi, through audio messages from their terrorists till the last minute While talking about fighting, according to reports, Baghdadi himself has fled from Mosul and is hiding in Syria
 udhar, america fouj ne daawa kiya he ki pichley gyaarah dinon kii ladaai main mosul kii jang main kareeb 900 aatankwaadi maare ja chuke hai
 Although till now the troops were fighting in the areas around Mosul, but now their hideout is in the city of Mosul, where there is a fear of terrible fighting as the terrorists have kept the towns here as their shield
 'sarender karo varanaa goli khao'teen taraf se bagdadi ke aatankiyon ko gher-gherkar maarane kaa kaam shuru ho chukaa he
 Only one path has been left for these terrorists, so that they can escape to save their lives
 magar ye rasta bhi maut kaa rasta he
 This is the last announcement for those who issue a decree of terror to the world
 haath uthaa kar sarender kar do, varanaa bujadilon kii tarah peeth par goliyaan khao or vahaan jaao jahaan ke naam par tum duniya ke naujavaanon ko bargala kar apane aatank ke kunbe main shaamil karte ho
 Mosul has run away and Baghdadi is against the threat of terrorism
 ab bagdadi ke fatvon ko sunne vaala bhi koi nahin he
 His terrorists have either laid on the ground or are shying away from Mosul to save their lives
 magar bagdadi he ki aatank ke suraj ke doobane se pehle puure aasmaan ko surkh karne ke liye amada he
 Although Baghdadi has run away from Mosul himself for fear of death, but is giving his dajjals a call
 maaro maaro isse pehle ki maare jaao
 Operation Mosul of the Iraqi Army has made it clear that the black sun on which the Arabian sandy land had risen two and a half years ago, is now just about to sink
 gher kar maarane kii he taiyaarimosul ke nakshe se aatank kaa kaala saaya mitata ja rahaa he
 Baghdadi militants from three sides have been surrounded by Iraqi forces, Kurdish forces and Shia militias, and the path leading from Iraq's Mosul to Raqqa in Syria is left blank
 taaki is raste se aatanki bhaagane kii koshish karen or jiske raste main padane vaale ek bade pul ko ranneeti ke tahat pehle hi tod diya gaya he taaki dehshat ke in numaayindon ko gher kar maaraa ja sake
 Iraqi forces advancing south to occupy Mosul City have regained control of a dozen more villages and have now reached a distance of just 4 km from Mosul's airport
 vahiin duusari taraf kurd peshmarga army ne mosul ke purvi hisse bashika par apana kabja jamaa liya he
 The distance from Mosul City to Bashika is just 13 km
 mosul ke uttari purvi hisse or syria se lagane vaali simaaon kii taraf se papular mobiligeshan force ke naam se mashhoor shiya milicia kii fouj jisamen sunni ladaake bhi shaamil hai jisane iesas par apana shikanja kas rakhaa he or aatankiyon ko gher-gherkar unase unke kiye kaa hisaab le rahi hai
 Continuing the exodus of people together, the sandy land of Arabia on which Baghdadi had planted a black flag of terror is going to be uprooted
 ab bas elaan kaa intjaar he
 Nearly three lakh people have already fled the city of Mosul with a population of 1
5 million
 ab iraqi fouj kii chadhaai ke baad kareeb ek lakh log mosul chhod kar saria or turki kii taraf ja rahe hai
 Actually, the danger to the people of Mosul is that by seeing the defeat close, IS militants can make them their shield
 aies ne isaki shuruuaat bhi kar di he
 He is setting fire in oil wells as well as throwing oil on the roads and setting them on fire
 mosul main shikast matlab iesas kaa khatmies ke khatme ke liye mosul shahar kii aazaadee behad jaruri he
 In fact, after occupying Mosul in June 2014, Baghdadi not only made it the capital of his kingdom of terror
 balki yaheen se usne khud kii khilaafat kaa elaan bhi kiya
 So if Baghdadi is defeated in Mosul, it obviously means the end of the Islamic State from Iraq
 itnaa hi nahin mosul main tel kaa akut bhandar he
 
 agar ye shahar haath se jaataa he to aies kii kamai kaa ek bada jariya band ho jayega
 After this, only 10 percent of Iraq will be affected by IS
 aatanki tel ke kuon main laga rahe hai aagpentagon ke mutabik iraqi sena apane tay lakshya se aage chal rahi he
 However, it is also being feared that this war to evacuate Mosul from terrorists can be prolonged
 iske sanket bhi mil rahe hai
 The militants are going to any extent in retaliation to prevent the Iraqi army from entering Mosul
 sena ke tinkon ko nishaanaa banane ke alaava aatanki shahar ke andar tel failaa kar usamen aag laga rahe hai
 Due to which there is a great smell of smoke in the whole city
 or isi gubaar kii aad main wo khud ke liye bhaagane kaa rasta taiyaar kar rahe hai
 There is a great danger to the lives of the people, on one side where this great war of Mosul has become a question of prestige
 vahiin shahar main rahane vaale 15 lakh logon kii suraksha ko lekar bhi phikr badhane lagi he
 It is suspected that terrorists can use common people as a shield to save their lives
 lihaaja aise halaat se nipatane ke liye iraqi sena ne mosul shahar par kaaphi taadaad main parche giraae hai
 In which the common people are being advised what they have to do for their safety during the fight
 sanyukt raashtra ko andeshaa he ki mosul main ladaai ke chalate yahaan se kareeb ek lakh irakiyon ko jaan bachaane ke liye syria yaa turki bhaagna pad saktaa he
 More than three lakh people have already left their homes in fear of terrorists in Iraq
 lihaaja dobaar aise halaat paidaa hone kii sthiti main sharnaarthiyon kii madad ke intjaam abhi se shuru kar die gaye hai
 The preparations for this operation, which started to get Mosul out of the clutches of the terrorists, were going on for about a month
 abhi iraqi fouj mosul tak pahunchi bhi nahin he magar abhi se hi aatanki baukhalaaye najar aa rahe hai
 Experts believe that the countdown to the complete elimination of the Islamic State in Iraq has begun, because the city of Iraq is still the stronghold of IS
 baaki ilaakon se to uske pair kab ke ukhd chuke hai
 Even in Syria, only the city of Raqqa remains in possession of the Islamic State
 aise main mosul kii haar bagdadi kii ab tak kii sabase bady shikast hogi
 Videos of cruelty surfaced During the last battle against Baghdadi, the Iraqi army has some videos in which the garbage of Baghdadi has been captured
 aise hi ek video main aatankwaadi iraq ke kisi gumnaam thikaane par ek saath pachaas begunaahon ko goli maarthe dikhaai de rahe hai
 Later, all these dead bodies are buried together in a tomb
 aakhon main pattee baandh kar begunaahon bandhakon ko ISIS ke aatankwaadi maut ke raste par khinch rahe hai
 The fault of these innocents is that all of them are Iraqi Shia Muslims and Baghdadi considers them a threat to their rule
 or sirf isi jurm main bagdadi ne inke naam jari maut ke paravaane par apni muhar laga di he
 After the death in the same grave, they are first tied and controlled like sheep goats and then the terrorists fill them in vehicles and go on their last journey of life
 ek aisa safar, jiske puraa hone ke saath hi in sabhi ke sabhi bandhakon kii jindagi par bhi phulstop lag janaa he
 And then all the terrorists take these 50 innocent people to a secluded place where the terrorists have already dug a big pit on the ground to hide their enemies
 ye gaddha kya he, ek aisa samuhik kabr he, jise maut se pehle hi khod kar rakhaa gaya he
 And then as soon as they reach the spot, these terrorists do the same thing, due to which all their hostages are already simmering
 pehle unhen ghutanon ke bal bitha diya jaataa he or phir ek-ek kar sir main goli maar di jaati he or is tarah maut vaali jagah par hi unhen ek saath dafna diya jaataa he
 If sources are to be believed, this is a video that has just been handed over by the Iraqi army, but when this slaughter was done, it is yet to be confirmed
 rakka main chupe bagdadi kaa khel khatm karne kii taiyaariiraq main to khayr iesas pehle hi ghir chukaa he
 Syrian attacks continue in Syria as well
 kurdish fiteron ke saath-saath syrian fouj ne iesas ke garh maane jane vaale syria main use kuchalane ke liye khaas planning kii he
 On the other hand, the ongoing cross-border battle in the Iraqi city of Mosul and this readiness to surround ISIS in Syria in its biggest stronghold, Raqqa
 iesas ke liye itane mushkil halaat pichley do saalon main kabhi nahin hue lekin ab iesas ke din bas gitne ke rah gaye hai
 Abu Bakr al-baghdadi, the biggest mastermind of the terrorists, escaped from Mosul and is hiding in this Raqqa city, while the Syrian army and Kurdish fighter are preparing to surround Baghdadi and its terrorists from all around
 rakka ko chaaron taraf se gher rahi he senaek andaaje ke mutabik is vakt raka main do lakh sunni shahriyon ke saath iesas ke kareeb paanch hajaar aatankwaadi chupe hue hai, jinhone ek tarah se is puure shahar kabja kar rakhaa he
 Whereas more than 30,000 Kurdish fighters and Syrian troops have begun to surround Raqqa from all four sides
 or yahaan bhi thik mosul kii tarah hi raka ke aas-paas ke ilaako main aatankwaadiyon ke saath phogiyon kii jang lagaataar jari he
 The army is taking help of the drones
 While the Russian army is helping Syrian President Bashar al-assad bombing the terrorists' bases, the Kurdish fighters have now started using commercial drone cameras to counter the terrorists
 
 
 darasal in drone kii badaulat aatankwaadiyon ke khufia thikaanon kii tasviren fouj ko aasaani se mil jaati hai
 And this makes them easy to wipe out
 syria or iraq donon hi jagahon par aatankwaadi gorilla yuddh lard rahe hai
 They have dug tunnels in the whole city of big machines, which they use to hide, they also attack through these tunnels as per the need
 aise main drone aatankwaadiyon ko thikaane lagane kaa ek ahm jariya sabit ho rahe hai

 police is investigating the case
 maamla south dilli ke seva nagar ilaake kaa he
 Where a young man named Sandeep was staying with his family on rent in a house in Railway Colony
 uskaa ek saathi ganesh usase milane unke ghar aayaa tha
 But even after two whole nights, he did not return home
 shuukravaar kii shaam ganesh kii patni deepa apane pati ko khojate hue sandip ke kamare par par pahunchi
 So she screamed as soon as the room entered
 darasal kamare main teenjalihui laashen padi thim
 Seeing whom Deepa made a noise
 uski awaz sunakar log vahaan jamaa ho gaye
 Police was immediately informed about this
 soochna milte hi police bhi maukey par pahunch gai
 The police took the burnt bodies of the three youths in the room and sent them for postmortem
 police ne shanivaar ko bataaya ki teenon yuvakon kii pahchaan sandip, gaurav or ganesh ke taur par hui he
 The room in which Shavamilee was given was rented to Sandeep by a railway official
 yah adhikari isi imaarat kii pehali manzil par rahata he
 Additional DCP (south) Surendra Kumar said that the police has started investigating the case
 shav postmortem ke liye bheje gaye hai
 According to the initial report, three people have died due to burns
 magar vahaan aag kaise lagi yah abhi saaf nahin hua he
 ADCP said that according to preliminary investigation, Ganesh, a friend of Sandeep, had left his house in South Delhi's Kotla Mubarakpur area on Tuesday evening but did not return home
 gharavaalon ke kol karne par bhi usne phone nahin uthaaya tha
 Then his wife Deepa reached Sandeep's house to find out about him
 police adhikari ke anusaar ganesh aksar sandip ke ghar aata jaataa tha
 Sandeep used to stay here in the room with his family
 lekin in dinon uske abhibhavak apni beti ke paas madhya pradesh ke jabalpur gaye hai
 Police said Sandeep and Ganesh were residents of Nepal
 jabaki unka dost gaurav uttar pradesh ke aligarh jile kaa rahane vaala tha
 These three friends used to party often

 How the three died by burning, now the police is searching for the answer of this rider

 He has said that just as the opposition does not have the option of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the country, Nitish Kumar also has no option in Bihar
 susheel modi ne twit kar kaha ki jaise sansadeey chunaav se pehle virdohi dalon ke netaa pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa vikalp nahin de paae, usee tarah mahagathbandhan bihar main nitish kumaar kaa vikalp nahin de paaegaa
 He claimed that the NDA would repeat the success of the parliamentary elections in the assembly elections with stunning figures
 iske pehle videsh yatra se patna lautate hi susheel modi ne twit kar kaha tha ki nitish kumaar hi bihar main rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) ke captain hai or unke netritv main hi 2020 kaa vidhansabha chunaav ladaa jayega
 He also dismissed the question being raised on Nitish's leadership from within the BJP
 susheel kumaar modi kaa kahana he ki bihar main nitish kumaar ke netritv main hi ek baar phir endie kii sarkaar banegi
 Taking a dig at the Grand Alliance, he said that if the Grand Alliance had an alternative and credible roadmap for the development of Bihar, they would tell what they would do to pull a big line from the development of the NDA government
 jinke paas rajya kii behatar seva kaa koi vijan hi nahin, ve siem-ummidavaar par roj bayaanbaji karne ke sivaa kar bhi kya sakate hai?susheel modi ke is twit se patna se lekar dilli tak bijepi netaaon main khalabali much gai thi

 After this, bjp's CP Thakur also said that who will be the Chief Minister's face in 2020, bjp's decision will be decided by it
 abhi bihar main endie kaa netritv mukhyamantri nitish kumaar hai, lekin 2020 main mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar koun hoga yah abhi tay nahin he
 However, it was CP Thakur who also objected to the Janata Dal United (JDU) 'why should we consider the slogan, Thike to hai Nitish Kumar'
 unhone kaha tha ki nitish acha kaam kar rahe hai to phir yah kaamchalaoo naaraa kyon? The Delhi government will introduce 3,000 more buses this year on the capital's roads to improve public transport

 parivahan mantri ne kaha, 'cluster bason ke alaava, agast se rajdhani kii sadakon par 1,000 nai ditisi bason kaa parichaalan shuru kiya jayega jisase logon ko laabh milegaa
 'the seats will be booked in the bus through the app

 For this, what can be a better way than giving gifts on the occasion of Durga Puja in Bengal? He has announced a total of Rs 28 crore to Durga Puja pandals and many institutions
 yahi nahin, unhone durga puja samiti ke liye samarpit ek thimegitbhi likhaa he
 Mamta Banerjee called Durga Puja not just the pride of Bengal, but a global festival
 unhone kaha, 'puja hamaara gaurav he
 An exhibition on worship is also held on the banks of the River Thames (london)

 Pooja has now become a world fair
 'unhone puja pandalon ko kul milakar 28 karod rupee kaa sarkari sahaayta dene kaa bhi elaan kiya
 He said, 'our police is also organizing community development programs like blood donation
 kolkata main kareeb 3000 puja pandal hai or sabhi gaanvon main kul milakar 25,000 honge
 Each puja pandal of Kolkata Municipal Corporation will be given 10 thousand rupees

 The agenda that some organizations are spreading is not correct

 CM Mamata Banerjee has written a theme song dedicated to Durga Puja Samiti, a popular Kolkata based this year
 mamata ne durga puja samitiyon ke aayojakon ke ek kaarykram main somvaar ko kaha ki is theme geet kaa uddeshy ‚Äòagomoni‚Äô (devi kaa aahvaan karne vaala paaramparik bengali geet) geeton ko waapas laane kaa he
 He said, 'I was asked by Arup (mamata's cabinet minister Arup Vishwas) to write a song dedicated to his Durga Puja (suruchi Sangh) and i decided to keep the spirit of the songs in my songs' or Goddess Sarvabhuteshu' like Agamoni 
 ummid karti hum ki yah sabhi ko pasand aayega
 'popular singer and West Bengal Minister of State for Cultural Affairs Indranil Sen will give his voice to the song
 tahalaka ke ek puraane tivi vigyaapan main kisi gaanv ke nukkad par ek netaa anaap-shanaap bhaashan die ja rahaa he or bich-bich main ‚Äò‚Äòshiksha‚Äô‚Äô or ‚Äò‚Äòberogari‚Äô‚Äô jaise kuch shabd bol detaa he
 Suddenly, people get restless from the prick of crows
 kauwe pedo par, bijli ke taron par, handpump par chaaron ore chaa gaye hai
 On the other hand, the speech was going on, when a crow sits on the microphone and the leader stops speaking
 iske saath hi parade par likhaa aata he, ‚Äò‚Äòjhooth bole kauwa kaate‚Äô‚Äô or phir ubharta he, tahalaka ke mastahed (patrika kaa naam) ke saath tarun tejpal kaa bhari-puri dadhi vaala cheharaa
 It was talked about when Tehelka used to be a weekly tableoid
 sandesh sidhaa-sada tha
 The three letters made of "T" in English became synonymous with each other
 yani tii se tejpal, tii se tahalaka, or tii se truth yani sachaai
 Nowadays, Tejpal's face is again in the prime time of newspapers' front pages and TV channels, but this time not as a watchman of truth, but as a man who trampled the ideals for which he was known
 unka pichhlaa kariyar adarshavaadi vichaaron or vidrohi tevar ke saath kalam ke jaadugar, murtibhanjak, vivaadaaspad, jhooth ko taar-taar karne vaale khoji, udhyami, sarokaari, naitikta ke pahrue vagairah kaa rahaa he
 In this way, it is a different experience to see someone who allegedly created a myth for himself, allegedly as a sexual harasser
 isaki shuruyaat bhi unheen sthitiyon main hui jo unki shakhsiyat se mail khaati he
 Celebrities such as American film actor and director Robert De Niro and chess player Gary Kasparov were also present at that festival of ideas on the sun-drenched beach of Goa
 usee dauraan do maukon par 7 or 8 november ko kathith rup se yon utpeeda kaa yah kaala karnama ghatit hota he
 Two years ago, during the inauguration of this festival, Tejpal told the attendees to eat, drink, have fun and get in touch with the likes
 ‚Äô‚Äô tejpal par aarope he ki unhone apni junior sahyogi se lift main jor-jabardastee kii
 This junior colleague was entrusted with the reception of De Niro
 yah bhi gajab kaa sanyog he ki mahotsav main pehle din kaa vishay balaatkaar or ‚Äò‚Äòhamaare bich baitha daanav‚Äô‚Äô tha
 On 19 November, a day after the junior colleague sent a written complaint to Tehelka's managing editor Shoma Chaudhary, Tejpal emailed her directly saying, "you will remember that our conversation that fateful evening was quite juicy
" ham hansi-majaak main vaasana kii baat kar rahe the
 
 
 This incident happened in this light-hearted mood
 mujhe yah andaja nahin tha ki tum pareshaan ho yaa mujhe ek pal ko bhi yah nahin laga ki asahmati he
 Shoma Chaudhary has now resigned as Managing Editor
 agle din 20 november ko us 27 varshiya yuvati ne aarope saarvajanik hone ke baad pehali dfa tejpal ko jawaab diya or unki ek-ek baat kaa khandan kiya
 He wrote to Tejpal that the conversation on the night of November 7 was not at all juicy or light-hearted - "you were talking about sex or lust because you have been talking to me like that normally and unfortunately you have never done anything about my work
" Did not talk
 ‚Äô‚Äôusne aage likhaa, ‚Äò‚Äòasahmati or kya hoti he
 As soon as you touched me, i started to ask you to move away
 maine har us adarsh or naam kii duhai di jo hamaare liye ahmiyat rakhte the, tia (tejpal kii beti), githan (batra, unki patni), shoma (choudhary), mere pita (or aapke puraane saathi patrkaar)
 The reality is that my job is in your hands, so i had to ask for so many names
 aapako koi fark nahin padaa, balki agali raat bhi mujhase jabardastee karne kii koshish kii
 You were not listening
 tahalaka kii sampadakeey baithkon main aksar ham vichaar kiya karte the ki ‚Äò‚Äòkyon purush jaanavar ban jate hai
 "and when it used to happen that a man would not have the ability to hear denials
" maamle kaa saarvajanik hona tha ki patrika se istifon kii qatari lag gai
 50-year-old Tejpal began to change his tone and statement repeatedly when old friends publicly condemned him
 23 november ko unhone apni bina shart maafee waapas le lee or text massej main likhaa, ‚Äò‚Äòek jhooth se meraa jivan or kaam tabah kiya ja rahaa he
 He then said that the BJP government in Goa was "implicating" him
 ant main ve 26 november ko dilli hoicourt main agrim jamaanat kii arji lekar pahunche
 The application said that the "alleged allegations are completely false and later fabricated with bad intentions"
 ‚Äô‚Äô baad main unhone arji waapas le lee
 According to Arundhati Roy, who was her friend at one time, Tejpal's statements make it seem that the journalist she had hired, is now "not only a rascal woman, but also an agent of fascists
" ‚Äô‚Äô media reporton ke aadhaar par swatah sangyaan lekar maamla darj karne vaali goa police ne 28 november ko unhen donna paula thane main pesh hone kaa saman bheja
 And on 29 November, when the police arrived to interrogate them, they did not meet them at their Delhi home
 udhar, maamle kii jaanch-padtaal par najar rakh rahe mukhyamantri manohar parrikar ne is baat kaa khandan kiya he ki is maamle main unki khaas dilchaspee raajnneeti se prerit he
 Tejpal requested the Goa Police that he be allowed to appear on 30 November but his request was turned down and a non-bailable warrant of arrest was issued
 har ghotaale kii tarah is maamle main bhi rajnatik vakyuddh chhid gaya he
 BJP leaders are taking up the Tehelka case to blunt the Congress attacks on Narendra Modi in the female espionage case
 tejpal ko lekar siyaasi rekhaaen tahalaka ke 2001 main westeend oparation ke pehle hi khinch gai thim
 One of the reasons for this was that he was highly praised by the Gandhi family
 1997 main jab priyanka gandhi or unke pati rabart wadra ko sarkari bangale ke aavanton kaa vivaad uthaa tha to tejpal ne outluk main ek diary item likhaa tha, ‚Äò‚Äòve (priyanka) behad khubasurat hai or garimapurna sahajata banaae rakhti hai, varanaa ve us umr main hai jab yauvan ke hormone apana asar dikhaate hai
 Apart from this, their political prospects in this charismatic country in the name of Jawahar and Indira may be considerable
 is najdiki ko sabit karne ke liye bijepi netaa subrahmanyam swami ne pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii 25 june, 2004 ko congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke naam likhi chitthee jari kii
 In it, the Prime Minister has said, "I received your letter dated June 18, 2004 with which Tehelka editor Tarun Tejpal's report of pending investigation against him is attached
 main sambandhit mantralayon ko maamle kii jaanch karne or unki samiksha ke baad aage kii jaruri karrwai karne ke liye likh rahaa hum
 "then it was only a month after the UPA came to power
" loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne 27 november ko yah twit karke nayaa shigupha chhod diya ki ek kendriya mantri, jo tahalaka ke ‚Äò‚Äòsangrakshak‚Äô‚Äô bhi hai, tejpal ko ‚Äò‚Äòbachaa‚Äô‚Äô rahe hai
 Law Minister Kapil Sibal immediately challenged Swaraj to take his name directly instead of speaking in "gestures"
 sibbal ne tahalaka ke share rakhane kii baat kaa khandan kiya par kaha ki unhone 2003 main tahalaka ko 5 lakh ru
 "chande" tejpal par balaatkaar (ipisi kii dhara 376), oonche yaa prabhavi pad par baithe shaks ke balaatkaar ko anjaam dene (ipisi kii dhara 376-2-ke), or mahila kii garima bhang karne (ipisi kii dhara 354) ke aarope lagaae gaye hai
 a person in a high or effective position can be sentenced to a minimum of 10 years if proven guilty of committing rape

 Tejpal, the son of a military officer, started his career as a sub-editor in 1983 from the Chandigarh edition of the English newspaper Indian Express
 tab baari-bharkam shabdon ke prati unke moh ke chalate baaki sahyogiyon ko vahaan uplabdh ekmaatr dictionari par chhinajhapati kerani padati thi
 It is said that at one time there was a talk among the senior editors whether it would be okay to keep them because they are too arrogant and "too much of a stubborn person to be themselves"
 ‚Äô‚Äô akasar samachar ke sampadan ke bich tejpal ek kone main baithe milan kundra yaa time tathaa newzvik ke taaja ank padhate rahete the
 This increased his stature among some less literary interest peers
 unke ek purv sahyogi kehete hai, ‚Äò‚Äòun dinon vah sirf githan ko hi dekha karata tha (jo baad main unki patni baniin, ve bhi usee dauraan naukari karne lagi thim)
 "of course, both the copy desk and Chandigarh were too small to keep Tejpal tied for long
 ve unheen dinon aksar dilli pahunchakar sahitya or tab kachua chaal se tarakkee kar rahe bharat par likhane kii baaten karte the
 He got his chance for some time in India 2000 and then in 1988 he got a job at the copy desk of India Today
 yahaan tejpal kaa ek or rup ubhara-ve hansmukh or hameshaa har kaam ke liye taiyaar rahete the
 His development also started as a journalist
 ve pehle kitabon ke panne ke sampadak bane
 Then V
 es
 Hardly happy writer like Naipaul became the favorite literature editor
 patrika ne unki mahatvakankshaon par kuch samay ke liye lagaam kasne kaa kaam kiya
 In 1994, Tejpal's plan of some big and personal ambition began to develop in his mind
 financial express kii sande magazine main ve apni team banane lage, jo unki style kaa netritv sweekaar karti thi or aisa bos maanati thi jo unhen bharpoor aazaadee detaa he
 In 1995, Tejpal joined Outlook as a Managing Editor
 vahaan chaar saal tak rahe
 At the same time Arundhati Roy was looking for a publisher for her first novel
 tejpal ne photographer sanjeev seth ke saath milakar india ink naam se prakaashan shuru kiya jisane bukar puraskaar jeetne vaali pustak da god of small things chhaapi
 Whatever Tarun was touching, the thing was becoming gold
 phir vah samay aayaa jab tejpal ko apane bheetar maujuud adarshavaadi, gussell, sach bolne vaale insaan ke liye tahalaka dotcom shuru karnaa mufeed laga
 He used to edit this website and Anirudh Bahl was his hardworking shining operation work
 website ne 14 march, 2001 ko bijepi adhyaksh bangaroo lakshmana ko rishwat lete dikhaane vaala sting karke dhooma machaa di thi
 Bangaru Tehelka reporter Mathews was caught on camera taking money from Samuel
 phir, oparation westeend ke baad tatkaaleen raksha mantri jorge furnandis ko istipha dena padaa tha
 The operation also became controversial over the use of prostitutes to lure officers
 isi oparation ne tejpal kaa kad kaaphi ooncha kar diya
 After this, especially the TV channels did many sting operations and changed the media's view of things
 mahaj 17 saal main punjab vishvavidhyalay ke nae course ke liye kahaniyon kaa sampadan karne vaale shant, vinamr sampadak se tejpal centre kii sarkaar jhukaa dene vaale viraat sampadak ban gaye
 It was from here that the myth of the rebel Tejpal started to be made
 lekin tejpal kii safalataa vivaadon se dur nahin rahi
 His best days were probably those of achieving a high as a journalist
 bijepi kii aguai vaali endie sarkaar ne tahalaka ke reportron or paisa lagane waalon ko nishaanaa banaaya
 14 in Tehelka
 5 fisadi share rakhane vaale shankar sharma or devina mehara kii company first global ko share bazaar main jod-tod karne ke aarope main nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 When the moneylenders got scared, Tejpal got caught in the clutches of investors with vested interests, he came close to the Congress
 is par kai patrakaron ne un par in storion ke jariye apane vyavsaayik hit saadhane ke aarope lagaae
 Tejpal often says with a little pride that Tehelka represents a "thought"
 bhale hi is vichaar se unki apni nijee sanak ko badhaava miltaa ho, lekin yah udaaravaadi vampanthi falsafe kii bhi pratinidhi he or tejpal iske sabase dhakad yoddha hai
 The idea was chaotic and took many forms in different directions to persist
 tahalaka 2004 main saptahik tabalaayed ban gai
 In 2007 it became a weekly magazine
 is tahalaka ko 2009 main us samay jabardast badhaava mila jab trinmul congress ke vivaadaaspad saansad ke

 Invested
 is company main tejpal ke parivaar ke sadasyon kii hissedari thi
 He is one of the few journalists who have easily entered the field of fiction from fact
 unke upanyaason main andrikta or gambhirtha kaa adbhut sangam he
 His debut novel The Alchemy of Desire proved to be the best seller in France
 dhaval dadhi, chotii vaale bal, alankaaron se ladi bhashaa vaale tejpal ke doston kii qatari main film abhinayta aamir khan se lekar tina brown tak shaamil hai
 All these people are expected of his charming personality
 ye sab tab bhi unke dost bane rahe jab tejpal ne tahalaka ke mul vichaar ko hi darkinar kar diya yaa is had tak chale gaye ki tahalaka main chhapane vaali khabaron or isamen lagane vaale paise kaa aapas main koi rishta hi nahin rah gaya
 The sharpest taunt on Tejpal's alleged high views came from a woman who was the victim of alleged sexual harassment
 duusari baar yon utpeeda kii ghatana ke din yani 8 november ke baad tejpal ne peedit ladki ko ek sakht esemes bheja
 In this, they were reprimanding the girl for why she told Tejpal's daughter Tia about the incident? Tejpal wrote in the message, "I was not at all sure that you would go to such a small point to tell him ( Will tell Tia)
 isse pataa chalata he ki tumhen baap-beti ke rishte kaa ratti bhar bhi bhaan nahin he
 "the female journalist gave a befitting reply to this," i cannot believe that you consider it a "minor matter" to sexually harass an employee of your daughter's age, and your friend's daughter
 jin vichaaron ke liye tahalaka jaani jaati he, unka rattibar bhi asar aap main nahin he
 "this dirty story is not important only because its central character is a well-known journalist who has been standing up for the same principles of equality, trust and transparency that he has been accused of violating
" yah shahari or kuleen bharat main workaplace main yon durvyavhaar or balaatkaar ke liye litmus test sabit hoga
 Tejpal's lawyers are now looking for flaws in the girl's statement which has not changed at all from the beginning, contrary to her stated version of the incident
 ve yah sawaal kar rahe hai ki ghatana ke baad bhi vah think event main kyon maujuud rahi or kathith yon durvyavhaar ke baavjood vah ‚Äò‚Äòparty kaise karti rahi
 "they are also raising the issue of why Tehelka Management was informed about this on November 18 after ten days
" varisht vakil vikaas paahwa ke mutabik tejpal kaa mukhya bachaav bas yah ho saktaa he ki ladki balig thi or yah uski sahmati se hua tha
 Another defense argument could be that it seems impossible to sexually abuse a lift in a two-story building
 varisht vakil aman lekhi ke mutabik ladki kaa paksh majboot he
 The most weighty thing in his argument is the letter written by Tejpal, in which Tejpal has admitted that he tried to have an illicit relationship with her without her consent
 lekhi ne kaha ki ghatana ke baad peedita ke vyavhaar se maamla kamjor nahin ho saktaa
 "saying that the conversation between them was flirting before the incident, Tejpal made the misconception that the victim would be ready for any dealings with him," he said
 ek baar to unhone use yah bhi bataane kii koshish ki ve uske bos hai
 Initially, when the girl's e-mail was leaked, Shoma Chaudhary and Tejpal became the most subject of ripping on TV and social media
 yah to saaf he ki tahalaka team kii pratikriya peshewar kam bhaavnaatmak, yahaan tak ki anaadipan vaali zyada thi
 In contrast, the girl's letter had clarity with the evidence gathered
 goa police ne jis furti or mustaidi ke saath karrwai kii usase bharat ke is sabase chote rajya ke log chakit rah gaye hai
 This made the people of the Tejpal camp wary and in this they started to smell the BJP conspiracy
 goa police ne swatah sangyaan lete hue kabhi-kabhaar hi istemaal hone vaali siarpisi 154 ke praavdhaan kii yaad dilaa di jisase tejpal ke is aarope ko bal mila ki iske peeche rajnatik agenda he
 In his anticipatory bail plea, Tejpal said that the party has "avenged him in the form of a proxy of FIR
" ‚Äô‚Äôlekin goa ke mukhyamantri is par tikhi pratikriya jataate hai, ‚Äò‚Äòjab unhone goa main samaaroh yojit kiye, pehle iske liye maafee maangi yaa sanyas par chale gaye (tejpal ke shabdon main, apane ko bachaane ke liye apane upar lage aaropon par praayshchit karne ke liye) tab unhen yah abhas nahin hua ki vahaan bijepi kii sarkaar he
 When they got caught in their own trap, did they realize this? "the Goa Police spoke to the girl on 26 November at an" unbiased, unknown "location in Mumbai and Mumbai Police Inspector with Investigating Officer Sunita Sawant She was also police sutron kaa kahana he ki kathith peedita ne ghatnakram ko ‚Äò‚Äòsaaf, bebaak tareeke se or dhyaan se‚Äô‚Äô bataaya
 He also carefully showed them before and after emails of the crime
 usase yah sawaal kiye gaye ki vah aakhir duusari baar tejpal ke saath lift main kyon gai or usne shikaayat darj karne main itani der kyon kii
 "the verbal statement of the victim is exactly what she has written in her e-mail," an official said
 The girl then flew to Goa on November 27 to record a statement in front of the magistrate
 ladki se baat karne vaale uske doston ne bataaya ki vah thakee thi, pareshaan thi lekin iraade kii pakki najar aa rahi thi
 If Tejpal would have thought that the matter would be suppressed by making atonement, then this bet has backfired
 unke aparaadh kaa majamoon kai guna bad gaya kyonki ab sandarbh badal chukaa he
 After the Delhi gang rape, urban India has become a different world, where justice of the streets and cyberspace has become as effective as the judgments delivered in the courts
 tahalaka ke launch ke samay jari pramotion ke ek madhe ja chuke poster main dadhi ke saath gambhir dikh rahe tejpal anant main ek taare kii tarah dikhte hai or isamen chapa vaakya ek galati kii bhavishyavaanee karata lag rahaa he, ‚Äò‚Äòaap satya ko nahin badal sakate
 But the truth can change you
 ‚Äô‚Äôjan patrakarita kii utkrisht avadharana par khadey ek sanghathan ke liye isse behatar sandesh nahin ho saktaa or us sanghathan ke sansthaapak, bhartiya media ke sarvshereshth dimag main se ek tejpal ab jivan ko badal dene vaale sach kaa saamana kar rahe hai

 lekin tab tak bahut der ho chuki thi
 Four unidentified men pulled the 28-year-old Taseer out of his gleaming two-seater Mercedes sports car into his car in the elite Gulberg area of lahore
 bhaag nikalne se pehle apartaaon ne taasir ke laptop or mobile phone ko unki marcedis gaadi main hi phenk diya
 Police say that Shahbaz was going to his office in Gulbarg without taking the policemen stationed under his protection, though he always used to leave with his security squad
 baad main taasir parivaar ke ek driver ne dekha ki shahbaaj kii marcidies car sadak ke bichobich khadi he or gaadi ke daravaaje khule pade hai

 is aadesh ke mutabik upie sarkaar main mantriyon ke staff ko nai sarkaar ke mantriyon ke staff ke taur par niyukti nahin kiya jayega

 ye itane kade he iskaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki 1 din bhi agar upie sarkaar main mantri ke staff ke taur par kaam kiya he to use nai sarkaar main jagah nahin mil sakati he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has once again warned all his ministers that in no case should any officer or employee of the previous government be placed in the private staff of ministers
 pradhanmantri ne ye bhi saaf kar diya he ki pichhali sarkaar ke kisi bhi mantri ne agar apane staff main kisi privet aadmi ko bhi rakhaa to bhi use mantralay ke staff se baahar kar diya jaae

 After forming a new party, Shivpal Yadav is going to hold a big rally of his party Progressive Samajwadi Party
 9 disambar ko lakhanu ke ramabai maidan main shivpal yadav janaakrosh raily kar rahe hai or daawa he ki mayawati kii tarah vah bhi is maidan ko apane samarthakon se bhar denge
 Shivpal Yadav wants to make his political power felt through his rally so that both Samajwadi Party and the ruling party can realize his strength
 shivpal yadav kii is raily main mulaayam singh aate hai yaa nahin is par sabaki najar rahegi, lekin shivpal yadav kii maane to mulaayam singh unke saath hai yaa nahin, ab yah myne nahin rakhata or vah parivaar se alag, ekala chalo kii raah pakad chuke hai yani parivaar main agar kisi ko unke saath aana he to wo aae, ab vah parivaar ke liye rukne vaale nahin hai
 1 day before the rally, Shivpal Yadav had a special conversation with Aaj Tak
 baatcheet main itnaa saaf ho gaya ki ab mulaayam singh kaa unke saath aana yaa nahin aana shivpal ke liye myne nahin rakhata
 He has caught his way
 postaron main bhi sirf shivpalis raily kii postaron ko bhi dekhen to har jagah sirf shivpal hi shivpal hai or shivpal kaa akelaapan bhi unhen raily main khaas bana rahaa he
 Photos of Mulayam Singh have been formalized but in posters, Shivpal is seen filling the path of 'ekla Chalo'
 shivpal yadav ne ajtak se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki mulaayam singh ab unke saath he yaa nahin ,ab ye myne nahi rakhata unhone apni raah chun lee he, jise aana ho aae
 Now the Yadav family is not his family but the entire state is his family
 shivpal ne kaha ki mulaayam singh agar samaajawaadee party se chunaav ladate hai to party unke khilaaf ummidavaar degi yaa nahin, is par party faisla karegi
 He wants to bring Mulayam Singh from his party to Mainpuri seat, but if he contests from another party, the party will decide whether or not to give candidates on his advice
 shivpal ne yah bhi daawa kiya 9 disambar kii unki raily main ramabai maidan bhar diya jayega or unki takat kaa ehsaas bijepi or samaajawaadee party donon ko hoga
 If Shivpal believes, his party does not want to be an alternative to the Samajwadi Party but to be an alternative to the BJP
 yahi vajah he ki samaajawaadee party ke tamaam puraane chehron ko shivpal yadav jud rahe hai
 Activists and leaders from all 75 districts have been called
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki raily main kisi bheed jutati he
 Shivpal Yadav is not opening his cards even about the party's alliance
 shivpal ne kaha ki unka puraa focus sirf apni party par he
 As for the alliance, it will be seen during the election that the party is currently preparing for all 80 seats
 bataa den ki shivpal kii raily ke 2 din pehle mulaayam singh yadav ne farrukhabad main akhilesh yadav ke saath manch share kiya
 On this platform of Samajwadi Party, Mulayam Singh Yadav was seen to be constantly encouraging the workers of Samajwadi Party, after that it became almost clear that now Mulayam Singh has also drawn his line
 agar ravivaar kii raily main mulaayam singh shivpal ke manch par nahin jate to yah saaf ho jaayegaa ki ab shivpal yadav akele hi apni ladaai ladenge
 Salute to the spirit of Divyang Chandrakant Doshi who attended the celebration of democracy
 polio se peedit chandrakant doshi pichley 30 varshon se lagaataar vot dene aate hai
 Every time they vote in elections, they want to give a message to the younger generation that everyone should vote
 yah bhi parv he, jiskaa jashn manaaya janaa chahie
 50-year-old Chandrakant fell victim to polio as a child and is on a wheel chair
 guuruuvaar subah jab chandrakant doshividhansabha chunaavake liye vot dene matdaan centre pahunche, to bahut hi utsahit the
 Chandrakant took Doshi from his wheelchair inside the polling station to his elder brother and got him to vote
 matdaanakentre se baahar aane ke baad chandrakant doshi ne muskuraate hue kaha ki har kisi ko apane mat kaa prayog karnaa chahie
 This is also a festival
 unhone kaha ki wo pichley 30 saalon se lagaataar matdaan kar rahe hai
 Chandrakant Doshi is a source of inspiration for all youth
 ajtak se baatcheet main doshi ne kaha ki jab har naagarik apane mat kaa prayog karegaa, tabhi desh main asli navasrujan aayega
 He said that the public should vote on the issues
 jab unase poocha gaya ki unke liye wo koun se mudde ahm rahe, jin par unhone vot kiya, to unhone kaha ki rojgaar sabase bada or ahm mudda he
 The government should also do something for the employment of the disabled

 The Modi government has crossed a barrier on the Muslim Women (protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill-2017
 guuruuvaar ko loksabhaa ne teen talaak bill ko paas kar diya
 Now this bill will be introduced in Rajya Sabha
 agar modi sarkaar rajyasabha main bhi is vidheyak ko paas kara leti he, to phir isko raashtrapati kii manjuuri ke liye bheja jayega
 This bill will become law after the President is signed
 ab rajyasabha main is vidheyak par charchaa hogi, jahaan bijepi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar kaa bahumat nahin he
 Opposition parties are protesting against the provision of punishment in this bill against triple talaq
 saath hi isamen sanshodhan kii maang kar rahe hai
 In the Lok Sabha also, AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi, including others, moved amendment proposals, but was rejected due to lack of support
 ab sarkaar ke liye rajyasabha se is bill ko paarit karana badi chunauti he
 At the same time, Modi government ministers and BJP are engaged in talks with opposition parties to agree on the triple talaq bill
 modi sarkaar isi sheetakaaleen satr main is bill ko rajyasabha se paarit karana chaahati he, jo tedi kheer se kam nahin he
 This is because the BJP does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha
 sarkaar ko ummid, rajyasabha bhi paarit kar degi billloksabhaa se bill paarit hone ke baad kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki hamen puraa vishwaas he ki congress loksabhaa kii tarah hi rajyasabha main bhi teen talaak bill par hamaara saath degi or ham bill ko sansad se paarit karaane main kaamyaab rahenge
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the triple talaq bill has come to provide justice to Muslim women

 In many Muslim countries including Pakistan, triple talaq is prohibited
 guuruuvaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bijepi kii sansadeey baithak main ummid jataai ki sansad ke donon sadanon main yah bill sabhi dalon kii sahmati se paarit ho jayega
 Apart from this, after the passage of the triple talaq bill from the Lok Sabha, the Union Home Minister also hoped to pass the bill in Rajya Sabha
 guuruuvaar ko unhone kaha ki aaj kaa din ek aitihaasik din he
 We are confident that the triple talaq bill will also be passed in the Rajya Sabha
 sheetakaaleen satr main bill ko paarit karana badi chunautithin talaak bill kaa biju janata dal (BJD), AIADMK, sapa or trinmul congress samet kai raajnneetik partiyaan virodh kar rahi hai
 However, mps of these political parties were absent during the voting on the amendment proposal of the Three Divorce Bill in the Lok Sabha
 rajyasabha main bijepi kaa bahumat nahin he
 In such a situation, there is a need for other parties to pass the bill
 245 sadasyeey rajyasabha main rajg ke 88 saansad (bijepi ke 57 saansad sahit), congress ke 57, sapa ke 18, BJD ke 8 saansad, AIADMK ke 13, trinmul congress ke 12 or NCP ke 5 saansad hai
 Even if the government joins all its allies, the support of at least 35 more mps will be needed to get the bill passed
 rajyasabha main kai vipakshiyaan partiyaan bill kaa jorshor se virodh kar sakati hai
 These opposition parties say that the bill should be amended and it is wrong to provide a sentence of three years
 rajyasabha main bijepi kaa bahumat bhi nahin he
 In such a case, the bill can be sent to the Parliamentary Committee for review
 agar aisa hua, to sansad ke is sheetakaaleen satr main bill kaa paarit hona mushkil ho jayega
 Owaisi had demanded six amendments
 AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi and some Congress leaders are also seeking amendments on the bill
 ovaisi ne to loksabhaa main teen talaak bill par chah sanshodhan prastaav pesh kiye, lekin unamem se sirf do sanshodhan prastaav ko hi sadan ne sweekaar kiya
 However, both Owaisi's amendment proposals were rejected
 unka kahana he ki yah bill muslim mahilaon ke saath anyaay he
 It violates the freedom of Muslims
 is bill ko taiyaar karne ke dauraan muslimon se salaah-mashvira nahin kiya gaya
 Muslim women celebrate Muslim women have been celebrating since the passage of the third divorce bill in the Lok Sabha
 haalanki abhi is bill ko rajyasabha main paarit karana jaruri he, jiske baad hi yah raashtrapati ke hastakshar ke saath kanoon kaa rup legaa paaegaa
 In Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Muslim women also burnt firecrackers
 loksabhaa main kanoon ke paarit hone ke baad se teen talaak peedit mahilaon kii bhi ummiden bandha gai hai
 The SC had given the government to make laws 6 months time
 The Supreme Court has already declared the triple talaq ie talaq-e-biddat
 22 agast ko sheersh adaalat kii paanch jajon kii bench ne bahumat se teen talaak ko asanvaidhanik or gaiyr kanoonee bataaya tha
 At the same time, the Modi government was asked to enact laws to protect the rights of Muslim women
 loksabhaa main teen talaak bill par charchaa ke dauraan bhi sarkaar ne supreme court ke faisle kaa hawala diya
 It will happen, the triple talaq billmody government has brought this bill in the name of 'muslim Women (protection of Marriage Rights) Bill-2017'
 ye kanoon sirf teen talaak (INSTANT TALAQ, yani talaak-e-biddat) par hi lagu hoga
 After this law, if any Muslim man gives three divorces to his wife, it will be illegal
 iske baad se kisi bhi swaroop main diya gaya teen talaak, vah chahen maukhik ho yaa likhit ho or yaa phir massej ke jariye ho, avaidh hoga
 Whoever gives three divorces can be punished and fined for three years, ie, giving three divorces will be a non-bailable and cognizable offense
 isamen magistrate tay karegaa ki kitna jurmaana hoga
 PM Narendra Modi had formed a group of ministers to legislate on triple talaq, which included Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Ravi Shankar Prasad, PP Chaudhary and Jitendra Singh
 teen talaak bill main ye hai praavdhaan- ek saath teen baar talaak (bolkar, likhakar yaa email, esemes or whatsap jaise electronic madhyam se) kahana gaiyrkanoonee hoga
 - The husband doing so may be sentenced to three years of imprisonment
 yah gaiyr-jamaanti or sangyeya aparaadh mana jayega
 - This law will apply only to 'talaq a biddat' i
e
 three times a divorce
 - talaak kii peedita apane or naaballig bacchon ke liye guzaara bhatta maangane ke liye magistrate se apil kar sakegi
 - The aggrieved woman can also request the magistrate for the protection of minor children
 magistrate is mudde par antim faisla karenge
 - This proposed law will apply to the entire country except Jammu and Kashmir
