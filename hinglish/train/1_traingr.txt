 The ministers of the government had also questioned the intention of the CAG regarding the report
 tel companiyon ko hone vaale nuksaan par kaig kii najravahin ek janhit yachika par sunwaayee karte hue supreme court ne sarkaar ko fatkaar lagaate hue kaha tha ki sieji sirf munim ji nahin hai

 karnataka sarkaar se samarthan waapas lene vaale teen baagi vidhayakon ko spikar ramesh kumaar ne ayogy ghoshit kar diya he
 These include Independent MLA r Shankar
 aar
 Shankar was the Minister of Corporate Administration in the Government of Karnataka
 baad main unhone sarkaar se istipha de diya tha or baagi vidhayakon ke saath mumbai chale gaye the
 According to the information, r Shankar had merged his party KPJP with the Congress
 aar
 Apart from Shankar, Ramesh Jarkiholi and Mahesh Kumthalli are among the two rebel Congress mlas who were disqualified
 spikar ne congress ke do vidhayakon or ek nirdaleey vidhayak ko 2023 main maujuuda vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal khatm hone tak ayogy qaraar diya he
 In his decision, the speaker said that he would decide the remaining 14 cases in the next few days
 spikar kii baton se saaf he ki baaki 14 vidhayakon par ve tatkaal faisla lene vaale nahin hai kyonki guuruuvaar ko apni press conference main unhone saaf kar diya ki agle kadam ke bare main unhen kaaphi kuch padhanaa padegaa
 They will take a decision only after paying close attention to all the evidence
 spikar kii baat yah darshaati he ki istipha dene vaale vidhayak agar ayogy ghoshit nahin hote hai to ve vidhansabha ke sadsy bane rahenge
 At present, there is confusion in Karnataka due to lack of quick decisions from the level of the speaker
 aise main bijepi bhi 'wet and watch' kii ranneeti apanaae hue he
 It is being said that the BJP, which had suffered a hasty government last time, is now in a mood to take steps
 aise main vah daawa pesh karne main vakt lagaaegi
 In such a situation, there is a strong possibility of imposing President's rule in Karnataka
 sankhyabal kii baat karen to 3 vidhayakon ke ayogy ghoshit hone ke baad vidhansabha main 223 vidhayak rah gaye
 In this sense, the majority figure stands at 112
 bijepi ke paas philhal 105 vidhayak hai
 He will need 7 more mlas right now
 ayogy ghoshit hue 3 vidhayak ab bijepi ke paale main nahin aa sakate kyonki spikar ne maujuuda kaarykaal khatm hone tak inhen ayogy ghoshit kiya he
 It is a different matter that these mlas win their battle in the Supreme Court or High Court and support the BJP
 isaki sambhaavna kaaphi kam he kyonki supreme court kii teen sadasyeey bench ne spasht kar diya tha ki spikar ko baagi vidhayakon ke bare main faisla lene kaa puraa haq he
 In this context, 3 mlas disqualified can no longer believe that they are no longer anywhere
 raashtrapati shashan ke prabal sanketabijepi saaf kar chuki he ki use rajyapal se milane or daawa pesh karne kii jaldi nahin he
 The reason is reasonable because he knows that he does not have the necessary strength
 sarkaar banane ke liye bijepi puri tarah se is par nirbhar he ki spikar baagi vidhayakon ke bare main jaldi faisla len lekin ab yah bhi adhar main latakta dikh rahaa he
 In such a situation, what will happen in Karnataka now? Answer: bjp's Karnataka spokesperson
 madhusudan pehle hi de chuke hai
 According to Madhusudan, "if the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly takes more time to accept or reject the resignation of the mlas, then the Governor (vajubhai Vala) can recommend President's rule in the state, because in such a situation we can form the government
 Would not like to claim

 Kishore Chandra is the anchor reporter of ISTV in Manipur
 21 november ko police ne giraftaar kiya tha

 The court has written in its judgment that it does not appear to have been an attempt to create enmity between the two communities
 na hi inaki baton main nafrat failaane kii koi baat nazar aati he, lekin NSA board ke faisle ke baad phir giraftaar kar liya gaya
 This decision has been criticized everywhere
 bhashaa shaleen honi chahie, lekin kya iske liye kisi ko rashtriya suraksha kanoon ke tahat band kar dena chahie? phir to soshal media par nehru ke prati apmanjanak tippanee karne ke aarope main na jane kitne log jail main band ho gaye hote, na jane kitne netaa-mantri jail main hote
 Chief Minister Biren Singh is a public figure
 unki aalochana hogi
 The language of his criticism will not be decided by any law
 karaab bhashaa or hinsak bhashaa kii hameshaa aalochana hogi, lekin ise thik karne ke liye rashtriya suraksha kanoon kaa istamaal hoga, yah uchit nahin he
 Accordingly, both the Prime Minister and Amit Shah break the dignity of the language many times
 unke virdohi bhi unke kilaaf bhashaa kii maryaada tod jate hai, lekin pradhanmantri ke bare main tippanee karne par unke kaarykaal main darjanon log alag-alag jagahon par giraftaar kiye gaye hai
 Many such incidents have also happened in Uttar Pradesh
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kii aalochana kii, to cese ho gaya
 Does the Prime Minister really not pay attention to these things? There is time to tweet on trivial matters, but have never seen criticism of these things
 kya unki or mukhyamantriyon kii aalochana karne par jail hona chahie? kya vaaki aapako lagata he ki kishorchandra kii bhashaa ke kaaran manipur kii kanoon vyavastha ko khatara he? in sab baton ko dhyaan main rakhaa kiijie, varanaa bolne ke tamaam darvaaze band ho jaaenge or ek din aapke ghar ke darvaaze band kiye jaaenge

 mukhyamantri kaa ek photoshop bayaan chal rahaa tha, jise avinaash ne anjaane main twit karte hue juuta maarane kii baat likh di
 Avinash has refused to apologize for this
 bhashaa kii aalochana ho sakati he, magar kya police ko in sab maamalon main padana chahie? juute maarane se lekar putale foonkane ke na jane kitne naare lagate hai, kya ab yah sab aparaadh hai? phir police har pradarshan main hathkadiyaan lekar jaae, naaraa lagane waalon ko pahanaati rahe
 His handcuffs will fall short
 or agar yahi sahi he to ekatarfa kyon ho rahaa he, kya vahi thana prabharee mukhyamantri kii bhashaa ko lekar cese darj kar saktaa he? khud pradhanmantri notebandi ke dauraan chauraahey par juute maarane kii baat kar chuke hai
 Talking of shoes is a feudal and bad legacy of our language
 is kaaran asahmati kaa anjaam kya cese mukadmaa or thana-police hoga? main to putala phunke jane kaa bhi virdohi hum, or juute maarane kaa bhi, lekin is maamle main police ke padane kaa bhi virdohi hum

 The hosts had defeated England in the first match
 australia ke saamne jeet ke liye 268 ranon kaa lakshya tha jise usne 49 overon main chah wicket ke nuksaan par hasil kar liya
 Australia's three quick wickets in the last 10 overs made the match a little interesting, but the Australian batsmen did not lose their patience and registered a win

 Umesh Yadav took two wickets for India
 vahiin mohammad sami, ravichandran aswin, akshar patel or bhubaneshwar kumaar ko ek-ek safalataa mili

 umesh yadav ne 10wein over main warner ko suresh raina ke haathon kaich karakar is jodi ko todaa

 akshar patel ne haalanki watson ko bold kar bhartiya team ke liye ek baar phir ummiden jataai
 Finch's 101-run third wicket partnership with Steven Smith (47), however, clouded the expectations of Indian fans

 kya aapako pataa he ki bharat ke tamaam kalejon, skulon main kitne pad khaali hai or unki jagah theke par padhaane vaale shikshakon kii aarthik or saamaajik haalat kya he
 Would you like to think a bit about the condition of your teachers on whom your children's future depends, which has spoiled your future in the face of all the fake issues
 jo log paanch sitambar ko shikshak diwas ke naam par greeting card baantate hai or banaate hai unhen bhi idia nahin ki us diwas ke yogya shikshakon kii haalat kya he
 This condition is not from today, but this condition was also yesterday, it is still today and will be tomorrow
 jis tarah bharat main theke par shikshak rakhe jate hai, america main bhi vahi haalat he
 In India, temporary teachers hired are called by different names
 edock, guest, kantrecual, temporary in naamon se ye lekturer kalejon main rakhe jate hai
 In the USA these are called Adjunct, Indenture
 bharat main college main padhaane vaale har kisi ko professor hi kaha jaataa he
 By 2013, there were reports on the plight of US university professors
 30 sitambar ko gardian main ek or bhayaavah report chhapi he
 Poverty report of professors
 asthaayee rup se padhaane vaali ek mahila lekturer kii garibi use sex varkar kii duniya main le gai
 When the load of teaching the course decreased, the money became less
 bahut koshishon ke baad bhi jab karch ke liye paise nahin jute to vah tut gai
 She teaches in class with a name and face in front of everyone, but to tell the world her trouble, the name and face have to be hidden
 nai peedi ko padhaane ke liye, unke andar samaj viksit karne ke liye unka kamitment itnaa gaharaa he ki ve padhaane ke kaam se khud ko alag nahin kar paati hai
 By the way, not everyone gets some other work so easily
 ho saktaa he sex varkar kii duniya main kisi lekturer ke jane kaa kissa apwaad bhar ho, magar sab kuch apwaad nahin he
 It is true that there are temporary or contractual professors who do not live a respectable life on the basis of earning
 ab to kai saal se prophessoron kii garibi par report likhi ja rahi hai or survey kiye ja rahe hai
 According to a report, 60 to 70 percent of professors in US colleges are now hired
 course padhaane ke hisaab se selary milti he jo bahut kam hoti he
 The condition is that many professors are homeless, living in small tenements
 kuch footpath par rahete hai or kuch ne car ko hi apana ghar bana liya he
 The government subsidies for food and treatment depend on the scheme
 carch main jaakar khaanaa khate hai or phir class main padhaate hai
 Teaches 60-60 hours a week, yet earning is not complete
 class se nikalakar ola-ubar kii texiyaan chalaate hai
 The teachers there do not have the financial power to eat, so they keep a recipe for preparing food with meat scraps, chicken bones and orange peel
 asthaayee shikshakon kii garibi kii duniya main khaanaa banane kii racippi bhi alag he
 The teachers there also do not tell about their situation like the teacher here
 kuch saal pehle jab vahaan kii ek asthaayee teacher ne duniya ko bataaya ki ve beghar hai, sadak par rahi hai or neuyark ke shiksha vibhaag ke saamne pradarshan karne lageen tab jaakar hedline bani
 The attention of the people went to this
 1990 se 2009 ke bich theke par rakhe jane vaale prophessoron kii sankhya badi he
 In the US, the budget on education is becoming increasingly frequent
 collejon main permanent kii jagah theke ke shikshakon se kaam chalaaya jaataa he
 Contract teachers are also given less work so that the budget can be saved
 theke ke shikshak kaaphi saste hote hai
 They also do not have to provide research funds and other facilities
 chaalaaki se unki padhai kaa samay kam kar diya jaataa he taaki ve swasthya beemaa ke yogya na ho saken
 In the Guardian report, a teacher said that after the mother's death, she was in class at eight o'clock the next morning
 asthaayee shikshakon ko chhuttiyaan nahin milti hai
 When she came out of class, she fell in the parking lot
 ek angrezi ke asthaayee professor james penni or unke pati kaa bayaan chapa he
 Both of them live in the car
 usee car main inke saath do kute bhi rahete hai
 Nothing is placed on the dashboard nor on the floor so that no one knows that they are homeless
 kapade sambhaal kar pahante hai taaki garibi baahar se na dikh jaae
 Some teachers have stayed in a very small room
 beemaari ke ilaaj main or bhi karze se dab jate hai
 Keeping his name a secret in the Indian Express of September 5, 2016, an adhoc lecturer wrote to the President that you will not know our name but millions of temporary teachers like us are teaching in the university and serving the country
 kisi bhi uniwarsity main hamaara hi bahumat he
 We have been teaching temporarily for 20-20 years
 naam na bataate hue janaab ne likhaa he ki 25 saal kii umr main korporate kii naukari chhod padhaane kaa faisla kiya tha
 But for twenty years i am seeing that we are members of the university only between April and June
 har saal vahi certificate kii photocopy baar-baar jamaa karte hai
 We don't know what we will do next season or next year
 medical live nahin miltaa, beemaa nahin miltaa he
 Due to lack of appointment letters, no one offers a house for rent
 ham kiraaya bhi thik se nahin chukaa pate hai
 Have you ever felt that the conditions of the professors of India and America will be the same
 desh ke vishvavidhyalayon or collejon kaa na to data he or na hi sarkarein is tarah ke data aapako detii hai
 Think millions of temporary teachers have been teaching for 20-20 years
 aadhi selary par wo desh kaa kitna bada kaam kar rahe hai
 Unemployment is being forced on the youth of India
 ye shikshak apana naam or cheharaa nahin dikhaa sakate hai
 If we look into their homes, can we understand how the financial condition of these teachers who have been teaching at minimum or half salary for 10-10 years? zyaadaatar edock teacher uniwarsity ke aas-paas ke saamaanya ilaake main rahete hai
 Lives in Santnagar, Burari, Wazirabad, Vijay Nagar
 bahut kam ke paas do kamaron kaa ghar hota he
 Most stay as a paying guest, whose rent will be five to seven thousand rupees per month
 akele dilli vishvavidhyalay main permanent kitne hai, edock kitne hai or guest kitne hai, isaki aadhikarik sankhya uniwarsity kii website par nahin mili jo ki honi chahie thi
 But the fighters for adhoc teachers say that there will be a total of ten thousand lecturers, out of which about five thousand adhoc and 1500 will be guest teachers
 edock ko 60,000 ke kareeb selary milti he magar wo bhi chaar maheene ke liye
 The guest gets one thousand for every lecture, he cannot get more than twenty five thousand a month
 dilli jaise shahar main aap class main teacher banakar khadey hote hai magar 25,000 kii kamai aapako jhuggiyon ke van room set main patake detii he
 Adhoc gets just four holidays in four months
 aise bahut se kisse hai ki meternity live ke samay naukari chhodani pad gai
 When the committee of NAC comes, adhoc work overnight for the recognition of the college
 college main principal or vibhaag ke adhyaksh ke badalte hi sameekaran badalata he or ve road par aa jate hai
 Nowadays, people with adhoc are searching for the address of RSS people in some way, earlier they used to search for the address of CPM people to somehow become permanent
 magar saare shikshak isi ke bharose yahaan nahin hai
 No one can raise his finger on his talent, but politics has not allowed any permanent
 department head kaa igo bhi tay karata he ki aapkaa permanent hoga yaa nahin
 Come, i am taking you through this dark path to the house of a temporary teacher studying in Delhi University
 aadmi or hawaaon ke andar aane ke liye ek daravaaza hi he bas
 There is no window
 jitna dikh rahaa he utana hi sansar he is teacher kaa
 Books stand along the walls
 itani kitaaben dekhakar lagata he ki yah teacher padhaata nahin hoga yaa padhakar class main nahin jaataa hoga
 The condition of the chairs is such that the poverty line of India rests on it
 ek saal se edock padhaane vaale teacher kaa yah cameraa he
 The rent of this room is three and a half thousand
 selary 60,000 milti he magar agle maheene milegi yaa nahin pataa nahin
 How many months will not be found after four months
 isliye paisa sanbhal kar karch karte hai
 This is the only toilet on five rooms
 aisi jagahon par andhere main hi janaa thik hota he
 Out of this room, when it reaches the master class, then fifty students will be expected
 ham edock shikshakon ke masale ko uniwarsity kii safai, prakriya or bajet kii kami jaise chatur bahaanon ke kaaran nahin samaj pate hai
 Every year, millions of students come to Delhi University with the dream that DU teachers who give admission at 98% will make their dreams come true
 uttar-purvi dilli ke is van room set main aath saal se edock padhaa rahe ek professor rahete hai
 The room is a bit big and clean as well but stays in this colony because a one room set is available here for seven and a half thousand rupees which is going to be 8,000 from next month
 har lacture ke liye 3-3 ghante padhane vaale ye professor jab 50 chaatro ke bich pahunchate hai to unhen lagata he ki sirf teacher nahin aayaa he, unke bich ek adarsh bhi aayaa he jiskaa kaam raashtra kaa nirmaan karnaa he
 Every leader goes on saying that teachers are nation builders, it will not say why the nation builders are in such a situation again
 is kamare main rahane vaale ne bataaya ki badboodaar pani se nahaakar hameshaa tarotaza bhi dikhnaa he
 i do not know when the earning of 60,000 will end, the sisters have the responsibility of marriage, did not even marry themselves
 aath saal se ek hi kalege main edock padhaa rahe hai
 This means there is a place in that college, so why is it not permanent? is kamare main hindi sahitya kii har behtareen kitaab he, gyaan kaa bhandar he, jo rahata he usne do kitaaben bhi likh lee hai magar naukari pakki nahin hui he
 Don't even know which college to stay in next semester, the relationship that is formed with the students is broken, don't worry about the teacher, think of the students, the teacher they trust disappears in the next semester
 
 van room set kii duniya main chalaa jaataa he
 One room class, one room life
 shaadi kii nahin he or kar nahin sakate
 If the posts of Delhi University start filling those vacancies, then it will take more than two years to fill all the posts, even when it is daily
 teacher kehete hai unamem jazbaa he padhaane ko lekar
 In Delhi University it cannot be that there is no teacher in the class
 edock ko hona hi padataa he or permanent bhi class lete hai
 There are painful stories about the holidays
 mata-pita kii tabiyat kharaab he, kisi mitra ko class dekar janaa hota he
 They are unable to go to their and friends' wedding
 chunki hindu-muslim vishay or siyaasi propeganda se media kaa spes itnaa bharaa hua he ki aapke zile ke college or rajya kii uniwarsity kaa haal saamne nahin aa paata or logon ko bhi kam hi matlab hota he
 Our colleague Anurag Dwari spoke to some teachers who teach in colleges in Chambal area of madhya Pradesh
 ek shikshak ke saath unke college bhi gaye
 Morena has PG Excellence College, where 1100 students study here
 zoology ke professor hai
 Since completing his phd in 2002, he has been teaching in this college
 15 saal ho gaye magar pakki nahin hui he
 Permanent did not happen
 inke jaise shikshakon ko atithi vidwaan kaha jaataa he
 The name sounds big, but if you hear his salary, you will turn off the TV
 ek college ke professor ko 7-8 hazaar rupye maheenaa miltaa he jabaki teen saal main 150 se adhik chaatro ko padhaate hai

 maatr 2638 shikshak hi sthai hai
 More than five thousand teachers are teaching as guest scholars
 jab pad khaali hai to permanent bharti kyon nahin

 smita sukhwal madhya pradesh ke agar malwa ke ek kalege nehru mahavidhyalay main atithi vidwaan hai
 The college was established in 1966
 is college main manzur padon kii sankhya 32 he magar maatr 5 hi permanent hai
 There are 27 teaching guest scholars here
 yani puraa kalege atithi vidwaanon ke dam par chal rahaa he
 One said why UGC takes NET exam every year when they cannot give jobs
 punjab main bhi haal bura he
 a large number of posts are also vacant in schools and colleges here
 yahaan ke shikshak sangh kii raajnneeti se jude pro
 Jaipal Singh said that regular teachers have not been recruited in Punjab since 2007, at that time only in English
 baaki subject main aakhri baar 1996 main bhartee hui thi
 Guest faculty is also in bad shape in Punjab
 inaki selary 21,600 se adhik nahin ho sakati he
 But less than half the salary the government gives, more than half the students pay at the time of admission
 teen saal pehle ek circular aayaa ki sarkaar 10,000 rupee hi degi
 The remaining money will be given by the parent-teacher Association
 pitie kii taraf se 11,600 rupaya admician ke samay jamaa kiya jaataa he

 Self finance teacher for this third category
 ye jis jagah par padhaate hai, wo sarkaar permanent teacher niyukt hi nahin karti he
 You must have heard self finance college, heard school, had you heard self finance teacher
 kareeb 200 se zyada shikshak is catagori ke tahat padhaa rahe hai
 They are kept for self finance course
 bibie, emsie, hospitality management tip isamen aate hai
 The children give their salary at the time of admission
 sarkaar inke liye ek bhi paisa nahin detii he
 Patiala has a famous bed training school
 1955 main isaki sthapana hui thi, iske udghaatan ke liye grahamantri jibi pant gaye the
 The institute is built on 200 acres of land
 kabhi yah punjab kaa number van santhaan tha jahaan se padhakar log teacher banate the
 Now there are ten subjects in this college, which trains teachers, for which there is not a single permanent teacher
 guest teacher se kaam chal rahaa he
 This condition is not from today, but this condition was also yesterday, it is still today and will be tomorrow
 jis tarah bharat main theke par shikshak rakhe jate hai, america main bhi vahi haalat he
 In India, temporary teachers hired are called by different names
 edock, guest, kantrecual, temporary in naamon se ye lekturer kalejon main rakhe jate hai
 In the USA these are called Adjunct, Indenture
 bharat main college main padhaane vaale har kisi ko professor hi kaha jaataa he
 By 2013, there were reports on the plight of US university professors
 30 sitambar ko gardian main ek or bhayaavah report chhapi he
 Poverty report of professors
 asthaayee rup se padhaane vaali ek mahila lekturer kii garibi use sex varkar kii duniya main le gai
 When the load of teaching the course decreased, the money became less
 bahut koshishon ke baad bhi jab karch ke liye paise nahin jute to vah tut gai
 She teaches in class with a name and face in front of everyone, but to tell the world her trouble, the name and face have to be hidden
 nai peedi ko padhaane ke liye, unke andar samaj viksit karne ke liye unka kamitment itnaa gaharaa he ki ve padhaane ke kaam se khud ko alag nahin kar paati hai
 By the way, not everyone gets some other work so easily
 ho saktaa he sex varkar kii duniya main kisi lekturer ke jane kaa kissa apwaad bhar ho, magar sab kuch apwaad nahin he
 It is true that there are temporary or contractual professors who do not live a respectable life on the basis of earning
 ab to kai saal se prophessoron kii garibi par report likhi ja rahi hai or survey kiye ja rahe hai
 According to a report, 60 to 70 percent of professors in US colleges are now hired
 course padhaane ke hisaab se selary milti he jo bahut kam hoti he
 The condition is that many professors are homeless, living in small tenements
 kuch footpath par rahete hai or kuch ne car ko hi apana ghar bana liya he
 The government subsidies for food and treatment depend on the scheme
 carch main jaakar khaanaa khate hai or phir class main padhaate hai
 Teaches 60-60 hours a week, yet earning is not complete
 class se nikalakar ola-ubar kii texiyaan chalaate hai
 The teachers there do not have the financial power to eat, so they keep a recipe for preparing food with meat scraps, chicken bones and orange peel
 asthaayee shikshakon kii garibi kii duniya main khaanaa banane kii racippi bhi alag he
 The teachers there also do not tell about their situation like the teacher here
 kuch saal pehle jab vahaan kii ek asthaayee teacher ne duniya ko bataaya ki ve beghar hai, sadak par rahi hai or neuyark ke shiksha vibhaag ke saamne pradarshan karne lageen tab jaakar hedline bani
 The attention of the people went to this
 1990 se 2009 ke bich theke par rakhe jane vaale prophessoron kii sankhya badi he
 In the US, the budget on education is becoming increasingly frequent
 collejon main permanent kii jagah theke ke shikshakon se kaam chalaaya jaataa he
 Contract teachers are also given less work so that the budget can be saved
 theke ke shikshak kaaphi saste hote hai
 They also do not have to provide research funds and other facilities
 chaalaaki se unki padhai kaa samay kam kar diya jaataa he taaki ve swasthya beemaa ke yogya na ho saken
 In the Guardian report, a teacher said that after the mother's death, she was in class at eight o'clock the next morning
 asthaayee shikshakon ko chhuttiyaan nahin milti hai
 When she came out of class, she fell in the parking lot
 ek angrezi ke asthaayee professor james penni or unke pati kaa bayaan chapa he
 Both of them live in the car
 usee car main inke saath do kute bhi rahete hai
 Nothing is placed on the dashboard nor on the floor so that no one knows that they are homeless
 kapade sambhaal kar pahante hai taaki garibi baahar se na dikh jaae
 Some teachers have stayed in a very small room
 beemaari ke ilaaj main or bhi karze se dab jate hai
 Keeping his name a secret in the Indian Express of September 5, 2016, an adhoc lecturer wrote to the President that you will not know our name but millions of temporary teachers like us are teaching in the university and serving the country
 kisi bhi uniwarsity main hamaara hi bahumat he
 We have been teaching temporarily for 20-20 years
 naam na bataate hue janaab ne likhaa he ki 25 saal kii umr main korporate kii naukari chhod padhaane kaa faisla kiya tha
 But for twenty years i am seeing that we are members of the university only between April and June
 har saal vahi certificate kii photocopy baar-baar jamaa karte hai
 We don't know what we will do next season or next year
 medical live nahin miltaa, beemaa nahin miltaa he
 Due to lack of appointment letters, no one offers a house for rent
 ham kiraaya bhi thik se nahin chukaa pate hai
 Have you ever felt that the conditions of the professors of India and America will be the same
 desh ke vishvavidhyalayon or collejon kaa na to data he or na hi sarkarein is tarah ke data aapako detii hai
 Think millions of temporary teachers have been teaching for 20-20 years
 aadhi selary par wo desh kaa kitna bada kaam kar rahe hai
 Unemployment is being forced on the youth of India
 ye shikshak apana naam or cheharaa nahin dikhaa sakate hai
 If we look into their homes, can we understand how the financial condition of these teachers who have been teaching at minimum or half salary for 10-10 years? zyaadaatar edock teacher uniwarsity ke aas-paas ke saamaanya ilaake main rahete hai
 Lives in Santnagar, Burari, Wazirabad, Vijay Nagar
 bahut kam ke paas do kamaron kaa ghar hota he
 Most stay as a paying guest, whose rent will be five to seven thousand rupees per month
 akele dilli vishvavidhyalay main permanent kitne hai, edock kitne hai or guest kitne hai, isaki aadhikarik sankhya uniwarsity kii website par nahin mili jo ki honi chahie thi
 But the fighters for adhoc teachers say that there will be a total of ten thousand lecturers, out of which about five thousand adhoc and 1500 will be guest teachers
 edock ko 60,000 ke kareeb selary milti he magar wo bhi chaar maheene ke liye
 The guest gets one thousand for every lecture, he cannot get more than twenty five thousand a month
 dilli jaise shahar main aap class main teacher banakar khadey hote hai magar 25,000 kii kamai aapako jhuggiyon ke van room set main patake detii he
 Adhoc gets just four holidays in four months
 aise bahut se kisse hai ki meternity live ke samay naukari chhodani pad gai
 When the committee of NAC comes, adhoc work overnight for the recognition of the college
 college main principal or vibhaag ke adhyaksh ke badalte hi sameekaran badalata he or ve road par aa jate hai
 Nowadays, people with adhoc are searching for the address of RSS people in some way, earlier they used to search for the address of CPM people to somehow become permanent
 magar saare shikshak isi ke bharose yahaan nahin hai
 No one can raise his finger on his talent, but politics has not allowed any permanent
 department head kaa igo bhi tay karata he ki aapkaa permanent hoga yaa nahin
 Come, i am taking you through this dark path to the house of a temporary teacher studying in Delhi University
 aadmi or hawaaon ke andar aane ke liye ek daravaaza hi he bas
 There is no window
 jitna dikh rahaa he utana hi sansar he is teacher kaa
 Books stand along the walls
 itani kitaaben dekhakar lagata he ki yah teacher padhaata nahin hoga yaa padhakar class main nahin jaataa hoga
 The condition of the chairs is such that the poverty line of India rests on it
 ek saal se edock padhaane vaale teacher kaa yah cameraa he
 The rent of this room is three and a half thousand
 selary 60,000 milti he magar agle maheene milegi yaa nahin pataa nahin
 How many months will not be found after four months
 isliye paisa sanbhal kar karch karte hai
 This is the only toilet on five rooms
 aisi jagahon par andhere main hi janaa thik hota he
 Out of this room, when it reaches the master class, then fifty students will be expected
 ham edock shikshakon ke masale ko uniwarsity kii safai, prakriya or bajet kii kami jaise chatur bahaanon ke kaaran nahin samaj pate hai
 Every year, millions of students come to Delhi University with the dream that DU teachers who give admission at 98% will make their dreams come true
 uttar-purvi dilli ke is van room set main aath saal se edock padhaa rahe ek professor rahete hai
 The room is a bit big and clean as well but stays in this colony because a one room set is available here for seven and a half thousand rupees which is going to be 8,000 from next month
 har lacture ke liye 3-3 ghante padhane vaale ye professor jab 50 chaatro ke bich pahunchate hai to unhen lagata he ki sirf teacher nahin aayaa he, unke bich ek adarsh bhi aayaa he jiskaa kaam raashtra kaa nirmaan karnaa he
 Every leader goes on saying that teachers are nation builders, it will not say why the nation builders are in such a situation again
 is kamare main rahane vaale ne bataaya ki badboodaar pani se nahaakar hameshaa tarotaza bhi dikhnaa he
 i do not know when the earning of 60,000 will end, the sisters have the responsibility of marriage, did not even marry themselves
 aath saal se ek hi kalege main edock padhaa rahe hai
 This means there is a place in that college, so why is it not permanent? is kamare main hindi sahitya kii har behtareen kitaab he, gyaan kaa bhandar he, jo rahata he usne do kitaaben bhi likh lee hai magar naukari pakki nahin hui he
 Don't even know which college to stay in next semester, the relationship that is formed with the students is broken, don't worry about the teacher, think of the students, the teacher they trust disappears in the next semester
 
 van room set kii duniya main chalaa jaataa he
 One room class, one room life
 shaadi kii nahin he or kar nahin sakate
 If the posts of Delhi University start filling those vacancies, then it will take more than two years to fill all the posts, even when it is daily
 teacher kehete hai unamem jazbaa he padhaane ko lekar
 In Delhi University it cannot be that there is no teacher in the class
 edock ko hona hi padataa he or permanent bhi class lete hai
 There are painful stories about the holidays
 mata-pita kii tabiyat kharaab he, kisi mitra ko class dekar janaa hota he
 They are unable to go to their and friends' wedding
 chunki hindu-muslim vishay or siyaasi propeganda se media kaa spes itnaa bharaa hua he ki aapke zile ke college or rajya kii uniwarsity kaa haal saamne nahin aa paata or logon ko bhi kam hi matlab hota he
 Our colleague Anurag Dwari spoke to some teachers who teach in colleges in Chambal area of madhya Pradesh
 ek shikshak ke saath unke college bhi gaye
 Morena has PG Excellence College, where 1100 students study here
 zoology ke professor hai
 Since completing his phd in 2002, he has been teaching in this college
 15 saal ho gaye magar pakki nahin hui he
 Permanent did not happen
 inke jaise shikshakon ko atithi vidwaan kaha jaataa he
 The name sounds big, but if you hear his salary, you will turn off the TV
 ek college ke professor ko 7-8 hazaar rupye maheenaa miltaa he jabaki teen saal main 150 se adhik chaatro ko padhaate hai
 Think you can not buy even a book on your subject by wishing for such a low income
 aapke bacchon ko kya padhaayenge
 38 posts have been created in Government PG College
 23 permanent hai or 15 asthaayee hai
 The Double Bench of Jabalpur High Court of Madhya Pradesh has ordered an order on 14 September 2017
 abhi tak sarkaar yah kar rahi thi ki asthaayee shikshak ko kuch samay baad vahaan se hataa de rahi thi
 She was replaced by another temporary teacher
 adaalat ne kaha ki inaki jagah doosraa jo aayega wo permanent hoga
 Temporary will not replace temporary
 asthaayee, kantrecual ko aap atithi vidwaan kah lijie magar sabko pataa he sammaan ke naam par shikshakon ke shoshan kaa naam badla ja rahaa he
 Some of the figures on the website of the state's Higher Education Department are as follows - Madhya Pradesh government colleges have 7677 teachers posts
 maatr 2638 shikshak hi sthai hai
 More than five thousand teachers are teaching as guest scholars
 jab pad khaali hai to permanent bharti kyon nahin
 Guest scholars are also rated on the website
 pataa chalaa ki atithi vidwaan ke bhi kai prakaar hai
 They have different names - atithi vidwaan praadhyaapak- 825 rupee prati kaarydiwas Guest Scholar Sportsperson - Rs 580 workday atithi vidwaan granthpal- 580 rupee prati kaarydiwas Guest Scholar / Teacher, Sanskrit College - Rs 390 per workday atithi vidwaan shikshak snaatak, sanskrit- 290 rupee prati kaarydiwas Guest Scholar Assistant Lecturer, Sanskrit - Rs 275 per workday aap dekhie ki kya haal he ucch shiksha kaa he
 The name is of higher education and the remuneration is of low standard
 sarkarein sanskrit ke naam par itnaa naatak karti hai, sanskrit ke atithi vidwaanon kaa rate yani mehtaanaa sabase kam he
 275 rupees
 nunatam mazaduri se maatr ek rupaya adhik
 In which factory of Make in India, India is becoming a world guru without giving jobs to its gurus
 smita sukhwal madhya pradesh ke agar malwa ke ek kalege nehru mahavidhyalay main atithi vidwaan hai
 The college was established in 1966
 is college main manzur padon kii sankhya 32 he magar maatr 5 hi permanent hai
 There are 27 teaching guest scholars here
 yani puraa kalege atithi vidwaanon ke dam par chal rahaa he
 One said why UGC takes NET exam every year when they cannot give jobs
 punjab main bhi haal bura he
 a large number of posts are also vacant in schools and colleges here
 yahaan ke shikshak sangh kii raajnneeti se jude pro
 Jaipal Singh said that regular teachers have not been recruited in Punjab since 2007, at that time only in English
 baaki subject main aakhri baar 1996 main bhartee hui thi
 Guest faculty is also in bad shape in Punjab
 inaki selary 21,600 se adhik nahin ho sakati he
 But less than half the salary the government gives, more than half the students pay at the time of admission
 teen saal pehle ek circular aayaa ki sarkaar 10,000 rupee hi degi

 Self finance teacher for this third category
 ye jis jagah par padhaate hai, wo sarkaar permanent teacher niyukt hi nahin karti he
 You must have heard self finance college, heard school, had you heard self finance teacher
 kareeb 200 se zyada shikshak is catagori ke tahat padhaa rahe hai
 They are kept for self finance course
 bibie, emsie, hospitality management tip isamen aate hai

 Patiala has a famous bed training school
 1955 main isaki sthapana hui thi, iske udghaatan ke liye grahamantri jibi pant gaye the
 The institute is built on 200 acres of land
 kabhi yah punjab kaa number van santhaan tha jahaan se padhakar log teacher banate the
 Now there are ten subjects in this college, which trains teachers, for which there is not a single permanent teacher
 guest teacher se kaam chal rahaa he
 The poverty of a woman lecturer who taught temporarily took her into the world of sex worker
 course padhaane kaa lod kam hua to paise or kam ho gaye
 Even after many attempts, when she did not get the money to spend, she broke down
 vah class main sabake saamne naam or chehre ke saath padhaati hai magar duniya ko apni yah takalif bataane ke liye naam or chehre ko chhipaana padataa he
 In order to teach a new generation, their commitment to developing understanding is so deep that they are unable to separate themselves from the work of teaching
 vaise har kisi ko doosraa kuch or kaam itani aasaani se miltaa bhi nahin
 It may be that the case of a lecturer in the world of sex workers is an exception, but everything is not an exception
 yah sahi he ki vahaan asthaayee yaa theke par padhaane vaale professor agar ek kamai ke dam par sammanjanak jivan nahin ji pate hai
 Now for many years, reports are being written and surveys are being done on the poverty of professors
 ek report ke anusaar, america ke collejon main 60 se 70 fisadi professor ab theke par rakhe jate hai
 According to the course, you get salary which is very less
 haalat ye he ki bahut se professor beghar hai, kiraaye ke chote se makaan main rahete hai
 Some live on the sidewalk and some have made the car their home
 bhojan or ilaaj ke liye sarkari sabsidi kii yojana par nirbhar rahete hai
 Go to church and eat and then teach in class
 hafte main 60-60 ghante padhaate hai, phir bhi kamai puri nahin hoti he
 Out of class, they run ola-uber taxis
 vahaan ke shikshakon ke paas khaane kii aarthik shakti nahin hoti, to ve maance ke khurchan, chikan kii haddiyaan or santare ke chhilake se khaanaa taiyaar karne kii racippi rakhte hai
 The recipe for cooking in the world of temporary teachers is also different
 vahaan ke bhi teacher yahaan ke teacher kii tarah apane halaat ke bare main nahin bataate hai
 a few years ago, a temporary teacher told the world that she was homeless, living on the street, and started demonstrating in front of New York's Department of Education when she made headlines
 logon kaa dhyaan is ore gaya
 Between 1990 and 2009, the number of contractual professors has increased
 america main shiksha par bajet lagaataar kaam hota ja rahaa he
 In colleges, contract teachers are employed instead of permanent
 theke ke shikshakon ko bhi ab kaam kam diya jaataa he taaki bajet batch sake
 Contract teachers are very cheap
 unhen research ke fund or anya suvidhaayen bhi nahin deni hoti he
 Their study time is cleverly reduced so that they do not qualify for health insurance
 gardian kii report main ek teacher ne bataaya ki maa kii maut ke baad agali subah aath baje class main thi
 Temporary teachers do not get holidays
 class se baahar ai to parking main gir gayi
 The statement of James Penney, a temporary professor of English, and her husband is published
 ye donon car main rahete hai
 Two dogs also live with him in the same car
 dashaboard par kuch nahin rakhte hai or na hi floor par taaki kisi ko pataa na chale ki beghar hai
 Clothes are worn with care so that poverty is not seen from outside
 kuch teacher to bahut hi chote se kamare main rahet hai
 In the treatment of the disease, more are buried under debt
 5 sitambar, 2016 ke indian express main apana naam gupt rakhte hue ek edock lekturer ne raashtrapati ko likhaa he ki aap hamaara naam nahin jaan paaenge lekin hamaare jaise lakho asthaayee shikshak uniwarsity main padhaa rahe hai or desh kii seva kar rahe hai
 We have a majority in any university
 ham 20-20 saal se asthaayee taur par padhaa rahe hai
 Without mentioning the name, Janab has written that at the age of 25, he decided to quit his corporate job and teach
 magar bees saal se yahi dekh rahaa hum ki ham sirf april se june ke bich hi uniwarsity ke sadsy hote hai
 Every year, they submit photocopies of the same certificate again and again
 agle satr yaa agle saal pataa nahin hota ki ham kya karenge
 Medical leave is not available, insurance is not available
 niyukti patr na hone ke kaaran kiraaye kaa makaan bhi koi nahin detaa he
 We also are unable to pay the rent properly
 kya aapako kabhi laga tha ki bharat or america ke profasaron ke halaat ekasmaan honge
 The universities and colleges of the country have neither data nor governments give such data to you
 sochie lakhon asthaayee shikshak 20-20 saal se padhaa rahe hai
 They are doing a great job in the country on half the salary
 berojgaare bharat ke yuvaaon par jabaran thopi ja rahi he
 These teachers cannot show their name and face
 agar ham inke gharon main jhankar dekhen to kya ham samaj sakate hai ki 10-10 saal se nunatam yaa aadhi selary par padhaane vaale in shikshakon kii aarthik sthiti kaise hoti he
 Most live in the general vicinity of Adhoc Teacher University
 santnagar, buraadi, wazirabad, vijay nagar main rahete hai
 Very few have a two-room house
 zyaadaatar peing guest banakar rahete hai jiskaa kiraaya paanch se saat hazaar rupee prati maah hota hoga
 How much is Permanent in Delhi University alone, how many are adhoc and how many are guests, its official number was not found on the university website which should have been
 magar edock shikshakon ke liye ladane vaale bataate hai ki kul das hazaar lekturer honge jisamen se kareeb paanch hazaar edock or 15 sau ke kareeb guest teacher honge
 Adhoc gets around 60,000 salary but that too for four months
 guest ko har lacture ke ek hazaar miltaa he, use maheene main pachchis hazaar se adhik nahin mil saktaa he
 In a city like Delhi, you stand as a teacher in class but earning Rs 25,000 slips you in a one room set of slums
 edock ko chaar maheene main sirf chaar chhuttiyaan milti hai
 There are many stories that he had to leave his job at the time of maternity leave
 nack kii cameti aati he to kalege kii manyata ke liye raat-raat bhar edock hi kaam karte hai
 The equation changes as the principal and department head in the college change and they hit the road
 aaj-kal edock vaale kisi tarah aresas ke logon kaa pataa khoj rahe hai, pehle ve sipiem ke logon kaa pataa khojate the ki kisi tarah permanent ho jaaen
 But not all teachers are dependent on this
 unki pratibha par koi ungali nahin uthaa saktaa magar raajnneeti ne koi permanent bhi nahin hone diya he
 The department head's ego also decides whether you will be permanent or not
 aaiye, aapako is andhere raste se aapako dilli vishvavidhyalay main padhaa rahe ek asthai teacher ke ghar le chal rahaa hum
 There is only one door for man and winds to enter
 khidki nahin he
 This teacher is as much visible as the world
 deevaaron ke saath kitaaben khadi hai
 Seeing so many books, it seems that this teacher will not be teaching or studying
 kursiyon kii haalat aisi he jaise bharat kii garibi rekha isi par aaraam farmaati ho
 This is the room of a teacher who taught adhoc for one year
 is kamare kaa kiraaya saadhe teen hazaar he
 You get 60,000 salary but will not get it next month
 chaar maheene ke baad kitne maheene tak nahin milegi pataa nahin
 That is why spending money carefully
 paanch kamaron par yahi ek shauchalay he
 It is okay to go in such places only in the dark
 is kamare se nikal jab yah master class main pahunchataa hoga to pachaason chaatro kii ummid ban jaataa hoga
 We do not understand the issue of adhoc teachers due to clever excuses such as lack of university cleanliness, process and budget
 dilli vishvavidlaay main har saal lakhon chaatr sapana lekar yahaan aate hai ki 98 fisadi par admician dene vaale diu ke shikshak uske sapanom ko saakaar kar denge
 This one room set in north-east Delhi has a professor who has been teaching adhoc for eight years
 cameraa thodaa bada he or saaf-suthra bhi he lekin is basti main isliye rahete hai kyonki yahaan saadhe saat hazaar rupee main van room set mil jaataa he jo agle maheene se 8,000 kaa hone vaala he
 When these professors, who study for 3–3 hours for each lecture, reach among 50 students, they feel that it is not just the teacher who has come, they also have a role model which is to build the nation
 har netaa bol kar chalaa jaataa he ki shikshak raashtra nirmaataa hai, yah nahin bolegaa ki raashtra nirmaataa phir aisi haalat main kyon hai
 The person living in this room told that one always has to look refreshed by bathing with smelly water
 60,000 kii kamai kab khatm ho jaaegi pataa nahin, bahanon kii shaadi kii zimmedaari he, apni shaadi bhi nahin kii
 Have been teaching adhoc in the same college for eight years
 iskaa matlab he us kalege main jagah he to phir permanent kyon nahin hota he
 This room has every good book of Hindi literature, a repository of knowledge, one who lives has written two books but the job is not confirmed
 pataa bhi nahin hota ki agle semester par kis kalege main rahenge, chaatro se jo sambandh banataa he wo tut jaataa he, shikshak kii chintaa mat kiijie, chaatro kii hi sochie, wo jis shikshak par bharosa karte hai wo agle semester main gaayab ho jaataa he
 One room moves into the world of sets
 ek kamare kii class, ek kamare kaa jivan
 Not married and can't dilli vishvavidhyalay main jitne pad khaali hai unhen bharna shuru ho to bhi saare pad bharne main do saal se zyaada kaa vakt lag jayega wo bhi tab jab rose yah kaam ho
 Teacher says he has passion for teaching
 dilli vishvavidlaay main yah ho nahin saktaa ki class main teacher na ho
 Adhawk has to be and Permanente also takes classes

 Jaipal Singh said that regular teachers have not been recruited in Punjab since 2007, at that time only in English

 But less than half the salary the government gives, more than half the students pay at the time of admission

 The institute is built on 200 acres of land
 kabhi yah punjab kaa number van santhaan tha jahaan se padhakar log teacher banate the
 Now there are ten subjects in this college, which trains teachers, for which there is not a single permanent teacher
 guest teacher se kaam chal rahaa he
 The teachers there do not have the financial power to eat, so they keep a recipe for preparing food with meat scraps, chicken bones and orange peel
 asthaayee shikshakon kii garibi kii duniya main khaanaa banane kii racippi bhi alag he
 The teachers there also do not tell about their situation like the teacher here
 kuch saal pehle jab vahaan kii ek asthaayee teacher ne duniya ko bataaya ki ve beghar hai, sadak par rahi hai or neuyark ke shiksha vibhaag ke saamne pradarshan karne lageen tab jaakar hedline bani
 The attention of the people went to this
 1990 se 2009 ke bich theke par rakhe jane vaale prophessoron kii sankhya badi he
 In the US, the budget on education is becoming increasingly frequent
 collejon main permanent kii jagah theke ke shikshakon se kaam chalaaya jaataa he
 Contract teachers are also given less work so that the budget can be saved
 theke ke shikshak kaaphi saste hote hai
 They also do not have to provide research funds and other facilities
 chaalaaki se unki padhai kaa samay kam kar diya jaataa he taaki ve swasthya beemaa ke yogya na ho saken
 In the Guardian report, a teacher said that after the mother's death, she was in class at eight o'clock the next morning
 asthaayee shikshakon ko chhuttiyaan nahin milti hai
 When she came out of class, she fell in the parking lot
 ek angrezi ke asthaayee professor james penni or unke pati kaa bayaan chapa he
 Both of them live in the car

 Nothing is placed on the dashboard nor on the floor so that no one knows that they are homeless

 Some teachers have stayed in a very small room

 Keeping his name a secret in the Indian Express of September 5, 2016, an adhoc lecturer wrote to the President that you will not know our name but millions of temporary teachers like us are teaching in the university and serving the country
 kisi bhi uniwarsity main hamaara hi bahumat he
 We have been teaching temporarily for 20-20 years
 naam na bataate hue janaab ne likhaa he ki 25 saal kii umr main korporate kii naukari chhod padhaane kaa faisla kiya tha
 But for twenty years i am seeing that we are members of the university only between April and June
 har saal vahi certificate kii photocopy baar-baar jamaa karte hai
 We don't know what we will do next season or next year
 medical live nahin miltaa, beemaa nahin miltaa he
 Due to lack of appointment letters, no one offers a house for rent
 ham kiraaya bhi thik se nahin chukaa pate hai
 Have you ever felt that the conditions of the professors of India and America will be the same
 desh ke vishvavidhyalayon or collejon kaa na to data he or na hi sarkarein is tarah ke data aapako detii hai
 Think millions of temporary teachers have been teaching for 20-20 years
 aadhi selary par wo desh kaa kitna bada kaam kar rahe hai
 Unemployment is being forced on the youth of India
 ye shikshak apana naam or cheharaa nahin dikhaa sakate hai
 If we look into their homes, can we understand how the financial condition of these teachers who have been teaching at minimum or half salary for 10-10 years? zyaadaatar edock teacher uniwarsity ke aas-paas ke saamaanya ilaake main rahete hai
 Lives in Santnagar, Burari, Wazirabad, Vijay Nagar
 bahut kam ke paas do kamaron kaa ghar hota he
 Most stay as a paying guest, whose rent will be five to seven thousand rupees per month
 akele dilli vishvavidhyalay main permanent kitne hai, edock kitne hai or guest kitne hai, isaki aadhikarik sankhya uniwarsity kii website par nahin mili jo ki honi chahie thi
 But the fighters for adhoc teachers say that there will be a total of ten thousand lecturers, out of which about five thousand adhoc and 1500 will be guest teachers
 edock ko 60,000 ke kareeb selary milti he magar wo bhi chaar maheene ke liye
 The guest gets one thousand for every lecture, he cannot get more than twenty five thousand a month
 dilli jaise shahar main aap class main teacher banakar khadey hote hai magar 25,000 kii kamai aapako jhuggiyon ke van room set main patake detii he
 Adhoc gets just four holidays in four months
 aise bahut se kisse hai ki meternity live ke samay naukari chhodani pad gai
 When the committee of NAC comes, adhoc work overnight for the recognition of the college
 college main principal or vibhaag ke adhyaksh ke badalte hi sameekaran badalata he or ve road par aa jate hai
 Nowadays, people with adhoc are searching for the address of RSS people in some way, earlier they used to search for the address of CPM people to somehow become permanent
 magar saare shikshak isi ke bharose yahaan nahin hai
 No one can raise his finger on his talent, but politics has not allowed any permanent
 department head kaa igo bhi tay karata he ki aapkaa permanent hoga yaa nahin
 Come, i am taking you through this dark path to the house of a temporary teacher studying in Delhi University
 aadmi or hawaaon ke andar aane ke liye ek daravaaza hi he bas
 There is no window
 jitna dikh rahaa he utana hi sansar he is teacher kaa
 Books stand along the walls
 itani kitaaben dekhakar lagata he ki yah teacher padhaata nahin hoga yaa padhakar class main nahin jaataa hoga
 The condition of the chairs is such that the poverty line of India rests on it
 ek saal se edock padhaane vaale teacher kaa yah cameraa he
 The rent of this room is three and a half thousand
 selary 60,000 milti he magar agle maheene milegi yaa nahin pataa nahin
 How many months will not be found after four months
 isliye paisa sanbhal kar karch karte hai
 This is the only toilet on five rooms
 aisi jagahon par andhere main hi janaa thik hota he
 Out of this room, when it reaches the master class, then fifty students will be expected
 ham edock shikshakon ke masale ko uniwarsity kii safai, prakriya or bajet kii kami jaise chatur bahaanon ke kaaran nahin samaj pate hai
 Every year, millions of students come to Delhi University with the dream that DU teachers who give admission at 98% will make their dreams come true
 uttar-purvi dilli ke is van room set main aath saal se edock padhaa rahe ek professor rahete hai
 The room is a bit big and clean as well but stays in this colony because a one room set is available here for seven and a half thousand rupees which is going to be 8,000 from next month
 har lacture ke liye 3-3 ghante padhane vaale ye professor jab 50 chaatro ke bich pahunchate hai to unhen lagata he ki sirf teacher nahin aayaa he, unke bich ek adarsh bhi aayaa he jiskaa kaam raashtra kaa nirmaan karnaa he
 Every leader goes on saying that teachers are nation builders, it will not say why the nation builders are in such a situation again
 is kamare main rahane vaale ne bataaya ki badboodaar pani se nahaakar hameshaa tarotaza bhi dikhnaa he
 i do not know when the earning of 60,000 will end, the sisters have the responsibility of marriage, did not even marry themselves
 aath saal se ek hi kalege main edock padhaa rahe hai
 This means there is a place in that college, so why is it not permanent? is kamare main hindi sahitya kii har behtareen kitaab he, gyaan kaa bhandar he, jo rahata he usne do kitaaben bhi likh lee hai magar naukari pakki nahin hui he
 Don't even know which college to stay in next semester, the relationship that is formed with the students is broken, don't worry about the teacher, think of the students, the teacher they trust disappears in the next semester
 
 van room set kii duniya main chalaa jaataa he
 One room class, one room life
 shaadi kii nahin he or kar nahin sakate
 If the posts of Delhi University start filling those vacancies, then it will take more than two years to fill all the posts, even when it is daily
 teacher kehete hai unamem jazbaa he padhaane ko lekar
 In Delhi University it cannot be that there is no teacher in the class
 edock ko hona hi padataa he or permanent bhi class lete hai
 There are painful stories about the holidays
 mata-pita kii tabiyat kharaab he, kisi mitra ko class dekar janaa hota he
 They are unable to go to their and friends' wedding
 chunki hindu-muslim vishay or siyaasi propeganda se media kaa spes itnaa bharaa hua he ki aapke zile ke college or rajya kii uniwarsity kaa haal saamne nahin aa paata or logon ko bhi kam hi matlab hota he
 Our colleague Anurag Dwari spoke to some teachers who teach in colleges in Chambal area of madhya Pradesh
 ek shikshak ke saath unke college bhi gaye
 Morena has PG Excellence College, where 1100 students study here
 zoology ke professor hai
 Since completing his phd in 2002, he has been teaching in this college
 15 saal ho gaye magar pakki nahin hui he
 Permanent did not happen
 inke jaise shikshakon ko atithi vidwaan kaha jaataa he
 The name sounds big, but if you hear his salary, you will turn off the TV
 ek college ke professor ko 7-8 hazaar rupye maheenaa miltaa he jabaki teen saal main 150 se adhik chaatro ko padhaate hai
 Think you can not buy even a book on your subject by wishing for such a low income
 aapke bacchon ko kya padhaayenge
 38 posts have been created in Government PG College
 23 permanent hai or 15 asthaayee hai
 The Double Bench of Jabalpur High Court of Madhya Pradesh has ordered an order on 14 September 2017
 abhi tak sarkaar yah kar rahi thi ki asthaayee shikshak ko kuch samay baad vahaan se hataa de rahi thi
 She was replaced by another temporary teacher
 adaalat ne kaha ki inaki jagah doosraa jo aayega wo permanent hoga
 Temporary will not replace temporary

 Between 1990 and 2009, the number of contractual professors has increased
 america main shiksha par bajet lagaataar kaam hota ja rahaa he
 In colleges, contract teachers are employed instead of permanent
 theke ke shikshakon ko bhi ab kaam kam diya jaataa he taaki bajet batch sake
 Contract teachers are very cheap
 unhen research ke fund or anya suvidhaayen bhi nahin deni hoti he
 Their study time is cleverly reduced so that they do not qualify for health insurance
 gardian kii report main ek teacher ne bataaya ki maa kii maut ke baad agali subah aath baje class main thi
 Temporary teachers do not get holidays
 class se baahar ai to parking main gir gayi
 The statement of James Penney, a temporary professor of English, and her husband is published
 ye donon car main rahete hai
 Two dogs also live with him in the same car
 dashaboard par kuch nahin rakhte hai or na hi floor par taaki kisi ko pataa na chale ki beghar hai
 Clothes are worn with care so that poverty is not seen from outside
 kuch teacher to bahut hi chote se kamare main rahet hai
 In the treatment of the disease, more are buried under debt
 5 sitambar, 2016 ke indian express main apana naam gupt rakhte hue ek edock lekturer ne raashtrapati ko likhaa he ki aap hamaara naam nahin jaan paaenge lekin hamaare jaise lakho asthaayee shikshak uniwarsity main padhaa rahe hai or desh kii seva kar rahe hai
 We have a majority in any university
 ham 20-20 saal se asthaayee taur par padhaa rahe hai
 Without mentioning the name, Janab has written that at the age of 25, he decided to quit his corporate job and teach
 magar bees saal se yahi dekh rahaa hum ki ham sirf april se june ke bich hi uniwarsity ke sadsy hote hai
 Every year, they submit photocopies of the same certificate again and again
 agle satr yaa agle saal pataa nahin hota ki ham kya karenge
 Medical leave is not available, insurance is not available
 niyukti patr na hone ke kaaran kiraaye kaa makaan bhi koi nahin detaa he
 We also are unable to pay the rent properly
 kya aapako kabhi laga tha ki bharat or america ke profasaron ke halaat ekasmaan honge
 The universities and colleges of the country have neither data nor governments give such data to you
 sochie lakhon asthaayee shikshak 20-20 saal se padhaa rahe hai
 They are doing a great job in the country on half the salary
 berojgaare bharat ke yuvaaon par jabaran thopi ja rahi he
 These teachers cannot show their name and face
 agar ham inke gharon main jhankar dekhen to kya ham samaj sakate hai ki 10-10 saal se nunatam yaa aadhi selary par padhaane vaale in shikshakon kii aarthik sthiti kaise hoti he
 Most live in the general vicinity of Adhoc Teacher University
 santnagar, buraadi, wazirabad, vijay nagar main rahete hai
 Very few have a two-room house
 zyaadaatar peing guest banakar rahete hai jiskaa kiraaya paanch se saat hazaar rupee prati maah hota hoga
 How much is Permanent in Delhi University alone, how many are adhoc and how many are guests, its official number was not found on the university website which should have been
 magar edock shikshakon ke liye ladane vaale bataate hai ki kul das hazaar lekturer honge jisamen se kareeb paanch hazaar edock or 15 sau ke kareeb guest teacher honge
 Adhoc gets around 60,000 salary but that too for four months
 guest ko har lacture ke ek hazaar miltaa he, use maheene main pachchis hazaar se adhik nahin mil saktaa he
 In a city like Delhi, you stand as a teacher in class but earning Rs 25,000 slips you in a one room set of slums
 edock ko chaar maheene main sirf chaar chhuttiyaan milti hai
 There are many stories that he had to leave his job at the time of maternity leave
 nack kii cameti aati he to kalege kii manyata ke liye raat-raat bhar edock hi kaam karte hai
 The equation changes as the principal and department head in the college change and they hit the road
 aaj-kal edock vaale kisi tarah aresas ke logon kaa pataa khoj rahe hai, pehle ve sipiem ke logon kaa pataa khojate the ki kisi tarah permanent ho jaaen
 But not all teachers are dependent on this
 unki pratibha par koi ungali nahin uthaa saktaa magar raajnneeti ne koi permanent bhi nahin hone diya he
 The department head's ego also decides whether you will be permanent or not
 aaiye, aapako is andhere raste se aapako dilli vishvavidhyalay main padhaa rahe ek asthai teacher ke ghar le chal rahaa hum
 There is only one door for man and winds to enter
 khidki nahin he
 This teacher is as much visible as the world
 deevaaron ke saath kitaaben khadi hai
 Seeing so many books, it seems that this teacher will not be teaching or studying
 kursiyon kii haalat aisi he jaise bharat kii garibi rekha isi par aaraam farmaati ho
 This is the room of a teacher who taught adhoc for one year
 is kamare kaa kiraaya saadhe teen hazaar he
 You get 60,000 salary but will not get it next month
 chaar maheene ke baad kitne maheene tak nahin milegi pataa nahin
 That is why spending money carefully
 paanch kamaron par yahi ek shauchalay he
 It is okay to go in such places only in the dark
 is kamare se nikal jab yah master class main pahunchataa hoga to pachaason chaatro kii ummid ban jaataa hoga
 We do not understand the issue of adhoc teachers due to clever excuses such as lack of university cleanliness, process and budget
 dilli vishvavidlaay main har saal lakhon chaatr sapana lekar yahaan aate hai ki 98 fisadi par admician dene vaale diu ke shikshak uske sapanom ko saakaar kar denge
 This one room set in north-east Delhi has a professor who has been teaching adhoc for eight years
 cameraa thodaa bada he or saaf-suthra bhi he lekin is basti main isliye rahete hai kyonki yahaan saadhe saat hazaar rupee main van room set mil jaataa he jo agle maheene se 8,000 kaa hone vaala he
 When these professors, who study for 3–3 hours for each lecture, reach among 50 students, they feel that it is not just the teacher who has come, they also have a role model which is to build the nation
 har netaa bol kar chalaa jaataa he ki shikshak raashtra nirmaataa hai, yah nahin bolegaa ki raashtra nirmaataa phir aisi haalat main kyon hai
 The person living in this room told that one always has to look refreshed by bathing with smelly water
 60,000 kii kamai kab khatm ho jaaegi pataa nahin, bahanon kii shaadi kii zimmedaari he, apni shaadi bhi nahin kii
 Have been teaching adhoc in the same college for eight years
 iskaa matlab he us kalege main jagah he to phir permanent kyon nahin hota he
 This room has every good book of Hindi literature, a repository of knowledge, one who lives has written two books but the job is not confirmed
 pataa bhi nahin hota ki agle semester par kis kalege main rahenge, chaatro se jo sambandh banataa he wo tut jaataa he, shikshak kii chintaa mat kiijie, chaatro kii hi sochie, wo jis shikshak par bharosa karte hai wo agle semester main gaayab ho jaataa he
 One room moves into the world of sets
 ek kamare kii class, ek kamare kaa jivan
 Not married and can't dilli vishvavidhyalay main jitne pad khaali hai unhen bharna shuru ho to bhi saare pad bharne main do saal se zyaada kaa vakt lag jayega wo bhi tab jab rose yah kaam ho
 Teacher says he has passion for teaching
 dilli vishvavidlaay main yah ho nahin saktaa ki class main teacher na ho
 Adhawk has to be and Permanente also takes classes
 chhuttiyon ko lekar dardanaak kahaniyaan hai
 The health of the parents is bad, a friend has to go by giving a class
 apni or doston kii shaadi main nahin ja pate hai
 Since the media space is so full of hindu-muslim subject and political propaganda that the condition of the college and state university in your district is not exposed and people also have less meaning
 hamaare sahyogi anuraag dwari ne madhya pradesh ke chambal ilaake ke kalejon main padhaane vaale kuch shikshakon se baat kii
 He went to college with a teacher
 muraina kaa piji exlence kalege he, yahaan 1100 chaatr padhate hai
 Is Professor of Zoology
 2002 main piechdi puri karne ke baad se isi kalege main padhaa rahe hai
 It has been 15 years but not confirmed
 permanent nahin hue
 Teachers like these are called guest scholars
 naam to bada sanskari lagata he magar inkaa vetan sunenge to tivi band kar denge
 a college professor gets 7-8 thousand rupees a month while teaching more than 150 students in three years
 aap sochie itani kam kamai main ye chaah kar apane vishay kii ek kitaab tak nahin kareed sakate
 What will your children teach? gavarment piji kalege main 38 pad srujit hai
 23 are permanent and 15 are temporary
 madhya pradesh kii jabalpur hoicourt ke dabl bench ne 14 sitambar, 2017 ko ek aadesh diya he
 Till now the government was doing this that the temporary teacher was removed from there after some time
 uski jagah doosraa asthaayee shikshak rakh le rahi thi
 The court said that whoever comes in their place will be permanent
 asthaayee kii jagah asthaayee nahin aayega
 Call it temporary, contractual guest guest, but everyone knows that the name of exploitation of teachers is being changed in the name of honor
 rajya ke ucch shiksha vibhaag kii website par kuch aankade is tarah hai- madhya pradesh ke sarkari kalejon main 7677 shikshakon ke pad hai
 Only 2638 teachers are permanent
 paanch hazaar se zyaada shikshak atithi vidwaan banakar padhaa rahe hai
 When the vacancy is vacant, then why not fill the permanent
 atithi vidwaanon kaa rate bhi website par diya gaya he
 It turned out that there are many types of guest scholars as well
 unke alag-alag naam hai- Guest Scholar Professor - Rs 825 per workday atithi vidwaan kridadhari- 580 rupee kaarydiwas Guest Scholar Granthal - Rs 580 per workday atithi vidwaan / shikshak, sanskrit mahavidhyalay- 390 rupee prati kaarydiwas Guest Scholar Teacher Graduation, Sanskrit - Rs 290 per workday atithi vidwaan sahaayak vyaakhyaata, sanskrit- 275 rupee prati kaarydiwas You see what is the condition of higher education
 naam ucch shiksha kaa he or mehtaanaa nimna str kaa
 Governments do so much drama in the name of Sanskrit, Sanskrit guest scholars have the lowest rate of remuneration
 275 rupee
 Just one rupee more than the minimum wage
 apane guruon ko naukari die bagair bharat mek in india kii kis factory main vishwa guru ban rahaa he
 Smita Sukhwal is a visiting scholar at Nehru College, a college in Agar Malwa, Madhya Pradesh
 1966 main is college kii sthapana hui thi
 The number of sanctioned posts in this college is 32 but only 5 are permanent
 yahaan par 27 shikshak atithi vidwaan hai
 That is, the entire college is running on the strength of guest scholars
 ek ne kaha ki jab naukari nahin de sakate hai to ujisi har saal net kii pariksha kyon leti he
 The situation is also bad in Punjab
 yahaan ke skool-collejon main bhi badi sankhya main pad khaali hai
 Prof
 associated with teachers union politics here
 jaipal singh ne bataaya ki punjab main 2007 ke baad se niyamit teacher kii bhartee nahin hui he, us samay sirf angrezi main hui thi
 The rest of the subject was last admitted in 1996
 punjab main guest faikalti kaa bhi bura haal he
 Their salary cannot exceed 21,600
 lekin aadhi se kam selary sarkaar detii he, aadhi se zyaada chaatr admician ke samay dete hai
 Three years ago a circular came that the government would give only Rs 10,000
 baaki paisa pareint-teacher association kii taraf se diya jayega
 11,600 rupees is deposited by the PTA at the time of admission
 tippaniyan There is another new category in Punjab
 is teesri catagori ko self finance teacher
 The government does not appoint a permanent teacher at the place where they teach
 aapane self finance kalege suna hoga, skool suna hoga, kya self finance teacher suna tha
 More than 200 teachers are teaching under this category
 inhen self finance course ke liye rakhaa jaataa he
 BBA, MCA, Hospitality Management types come in it
 bachche hi inaki selary admician ke samay dete hai
 The government does not pay a single penny for them
 patiala kaa ek mashhoor bied training skool he
 It was established in 1955, with Home Minister GB Pant going for its inauguration
 200 acre zamin main yah santhaan bana he
 It was once the number one institution of Punjab, from where people used to become teachers after studying

 But the fighters for adhoc teachers say that there will be a total of ten thousand lecturers, out of which about five thousand adhoc and 1500 will be guest teachers
 edock ko 60,000 ke kareeb selary milti he magar wo bhi chaar maheene ke liye
 The guest gets one thousand for every lecture, he cannot get more than twenty five thousand a month
 dilli jaise shahar main aap class main teacher banakar khadey hote hai magar 25,000 kii kamai aapako jhuggiyon ke van room set main patake detii he
 Adhoc gets just four holidays in four months

 When the committee of NAC comes, adhoc work overnight for the recognition of the college
 college main principal or vibhaag ke adhyaksh ke badalte hi sameekaran badalata he or ve road par aa jate hai
 Nowadays, people with adhoc are searching for the address of RSS people in some way, earlier they used to search for the address of CPM people to somehow become permanent

 If the posts of Delhi University start filling those vacancies, then it will take more than two years to fill all the posts, even when it is daily

 In Delhi University it cannot be that there is no teacher in the class

 varsh 1983 main pehali baar cricket vishwacap jeetne vaali bhartiya team ke captain kapil dev ne mangalvaar ko kaha he ki maujuuda bhartiya team main ballebaaji ke mukhya sirmaur viraat kohli is khel kii duniya main kisi bhi anya cricketer se zyaada record apane naam karenge
 Kapil Dev, considered the world's best all-rounder, believes that if Virat Kohli remains free of injuries, this Delhi batsman has the career graph of Sachin Tendulkar, who is truly a 'master blaster' and has recently been awarded Bharatharatna
 There is a chance to do 'better' than that
 test cricket main 434 wicket lene ke saath-saath 5,248 ran bhi banane vaale, or 'haryana hurricane' ke naam se mashhoor rahe kapil dev ne kaha, isamen koi shaq nahin ki viraat kohli kisi bhi anya khilaadi se zyaada ricard banaaenge
 
 
 i do not compare
 
 
 jaise doosraa don breadman nahin ho saktaa, usee tarah doosraa sachin tendulkar bhi nahin ho saktaa
 
 
 But yes, Virat Kohli has a lot of talent, and it is fantastic to look at a 24-year-old player, and i think he could probably do better than Sachin Tendulkar's record
 
 
 agali peedi ko pichhali peedi se behatar hona hi chahie
 
 
 The 55-year-old Kapil Dev is the ambassador for the prestigious Lares World Sports Awards, which will be given on Wednesday
 unhone kaha, viraat kohli ne dikhaa diya he ki usamen kisi bhi anya khilaadi se zyaada kaabiliyat or pratibha he
 If he continues to play at the age of 32 or 34 with the same fitness, without injuries, he can reach a place where neither Vivian Richards will have any records, nor Sachin Tendulkar

 The process of sealing in Delhi has started once again in Khan Market
 kal yani somvaar ko yahaan aath restaraan or salon ko sil kiya gaya tha or aaj phir yahaan kareeb 12 baje sevendhdwara sabhi restaraan or stores kaa muyna kiya gaya
 Today, illegal constructions on the first floor of about four buildings were sealed, while the first and second floors of the entire Khan Market were also seen
 NDMC ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki ceiling kii yah prakriya aaj puure din bhar chalegi
 And the place will be sealed if illegal construction is found and the rules are ignored
 kanvarshan chargeej ke bhuktan ke baad bhi sil kii gai dukaanesomvaar ko kareeb 3 baje kanvarshan chargeej kaa bhugtan nahi karne kaa hawala dete hue ceiling kii prakriya shuru kii gai thi
 But the association alleges that even after the conversion charges and all the nocs have been cleared, illegal constructions have been made an issue
 kisi bhi restro or store ke maalikon ko pehle se loi bhi notice nahi diya gaya tha
 Suddenly the sealing was done and despite all the documents being correct, the sealing is still going on
 jiskaa aadhaar ab avaidh nirmaan bataaya ja rahaa he
 Khan marketassociation spokesperson Dinesh says, "we were not given any information beforehand, despite all the nocs having sealed restaurants and stores, now illegal constructions are being cited as the reason
" market kii repyutesan taakh par he, pichley do dinon main kaaphi nuksaan bhi hua, graahak aane band ho gaye he, sabhi dukandaar dare he
 'customers supported sealing, while Khan Market in Delhi is considered the most posh market
 mahange hone ke saath-saath yah sabase purana marketon main se ek he
 And the customers here are also tied
 dilli ke hai class socity ke weekend hangouts bhi zyaadaatar yaheen hote hai
 And shopping is also done from here
 par yahaan aane vaale logon se jab baat kii gai to unka bhi yahi maananaa tha ki agar niyamon kii andekhi kar chal rahe restaraan yaa stores sil kiye ja rahen hai to ye sahi he
 But already NDMC and restaurant owners should be clear about the rule
 jisase yahaan aane waalon kii sefti daav par na lage
 Sima, who often comes here at lunch with her friends, says that this is right, but the authorities should have seen it beforehand
 agar yahaan koi kami thi to yerestaranitne saalon se chal kaise rahen hai, pehle to mileebhagat se inako chalaane kii parmishan di gai or ab kaarywai kar rahen hai
 Khan Market Association head Sanjeev Mehra believes that this approach is not right
 yahaan aisa kuch ilalegal nahin ho rahaa tha jiske liye ye tamaasha kiya gaya he, jo sil bhi hue he wo choti moti terres yaa coridor he, jiskaa hal mil baith kar baat chit se bhi nikaala ja saktaa he
 Such action was not required
 'aapako bataa de ki abhi tak avaidh terres or balakani aria hi sil kiye gaye he
 And if more than one room has been constructed on the second floor, then that too has been sealed
 dilli main kai pramukh ilaako par ceiling kii prakriya jari rahegi supreme court ke aadesh ke baad NDMC ne ye kaarywai shuru kii he

 Anyway, the local police is investigating these deaths, not the STF
 haalanki unhone estf se kaha he ki vah is disha main jaanch kare ki in mauton or vyaapman ke bich koi sambandh to nahin
 '' Comments esaiti chif ne kaha, hoicourt ke aadesh par maamle kii jaanch kii ja rahi he or jaanch ke bare main keval hoicourt ko hi bataaya jaataa hai
 He clearly said that there is no political pressure on the investigation team of the case

 The SIT Chief said, the matter is being investigated on the orders of the High Court and only the High Court is informed about the investigation
 unhone saaf kaha ki maamle ke jaanch dal par koi raajnneetik dabaav nahin he
 In fact, Justice Bhushan is heading a three-member committee of the Special Investigation Team (SIT), which was formed in 2013 to oversee the investigation into the widespread scam

 In his second term, Louis Tillin, the Modi government has indicated its intention to deepen centralization in India's federal system
 is agenda kii ruparekha pehle kaarykaal main hi dikhne lagi thi
 Accordingly, the coordination, finance management and implementation of the policies of the Central Government also require strong intervention in the areas which are reserved for the states in the Constitution and states have been the leading players in them
 iske saath hi, yah bharat vichaar ko ek ekal rashtriya bazaar ke rup main majboot karke rajyon ke bich pratispardhaa ko badhaane kaa prayaas he, jisamen vyavsaay, upabhokta or shramik sabhi gatisheel hai
 These are central themes of 'cooperative' and 'competitive federalism', which the BJP has been pushing forward since coming to power in 2014
 modi sarkaar apane duusare kaarykaal main ek rashtriya bazaar banane or antar-rajya vyapaar (ek desh, ek tex) kii baadhaon ko kam karne ke prayaas ke saath shram gatishiltaa ko protsaahit kar rahi he
 For example, one nation, one ration card, has also been promoted with the resolution of a national citizenship through the portability of ration cards
 kashmir kii swaittata ko khatm karne or hindi ko rashtriya bhashaa banane ke mudde ko phir se hawa dene se yah sandesh gaya he ki sanghavaad ke jis rachanaatmak or lacheele gundharm kaa upyog karte hue naagarikta kii bahu-stariyavyavastha taiyaar kii gai thi or jisane rashtriya or kshetreey vividhta ko samyojit kiya he, use dhwast karne ke liye iskaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 The call for a nation, a market brings together a range of policies, such as the intention to integrate the agricultural market, the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the states emphasis on a national grid to procure short-term power requirements and Various other efforts
 in nitiyon main se kai par kaam bhaajapa ke satta main aane se pehle hi shuru ho gaya tha lekin rashtrawaad ke vichaar ke tahat inaki khub saraahna kii ja rahi he
 In recent months, the government has separately pledged to introduce One Nation, One Ration Card Scheme, under which beneficiaries will be able to take their ration from any of the ration shops under any public distribution system for which they are eligible
 sarkaar ne ekal rashtriya nadi jal vivaad nyaayaadhikaran banane ke liye kanoon pesh kiya he
 It would also like to go ahead with its proposal (one nation, one election) to streamline the timetable of elections to be held at all levels for the formation of government
 is baat kii koi guarantee nahin he ki rashtriya or rajya str par ek saath hone vaale chunaavon kaa parinaam bhi ek jaisaa hi ho
 They will nevertheless help nationalize political debate and focus people's attention on national issues rather than state-specific issues during voting in elections
 ek rashtrawaad kaa vimarsh, jo is saal ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad bad gaya he, pradhanmantri ke rup main narendra modi ke pehle kaarykaal main dekhe gaye rajnatik rashtriyakaran kaa ek anya rup he
 During that period, the central government continued to show centrally sponsored government schemes as the property of the central government
 iske alaava, centre dwaara aadhaar or pratyaksh laabh hastantaran par jor dene kaa parinaam rahaa ki kalyankari laabh yojanaon kii vitaran agency ke rup main rajya sarkaron kii bajaae, centre sarkaar hi najar ai
 This centralized claim to credit came to an end with an argument prevalent in the era of political regionalization between 1989 and 2014
 isse pehle ke samay main, rajya sarkarein centre pryojit yojanaon ke shrey main hissedari paane main adhik sakasham thim
 Centrally sponsored schemes were designed by the central government but usually the state governments also gave their share of funds in it and the state governments also took responsibility for the implementation of those schemes
 rashtriya niti ko samanvit karne or vyapaar or vaanijya ke liye antar-rajya baadhaon ko todgaye ke kai prayaason kaa lanbaa itihaas he
 Even before the BJP came to power at the Center in 2014, policies like GST, Aadhaar, National Grid were being pushed forward
 rashtriya samanvay ke aise prayaason ke peeche majboot tark hai
 For example, many states have experimented with ration card portability for some time to allow ration card-holders to shop around and thereby improve the performance of ration shops
 ek rashtriya yojana banane se un pravasi mazdooron ke adhikaron ko sambodhit karne kii kshamta he jo apane grih rajyon ke baahar apane adhikaron kaa upyog karne ke liye sangharsh karte hai
 However, presenting these policies together as part of a nationalism agenda raises concerns about the challenges associated with India's federal balance

 "the sensitivity of the apprehension of the state governments being sidelined in the implementation of the public distribution system, the electoral implications of such a move are also known
 lokaneeti-siesds ke neshnal ellection study 2019 ke aankade badalte tareekon main ek antardrushti pradaan karte hai

 Along with Kailash, i have also analyzed this data and come to the conclusion that voters still owe PDS to their state governments

 In contrast, voters appear to be more likely to give credit to schemes like MNREGA or Ayushman Bharat to the central government than to the state governments
 is prakaar ek rashtriya rashan card yojana shaayad ek nitigat daayre main rajyon ko chunauti degi jisamen ve agrani khilaadi rahe hai
 At the same time, the central government is attempting to re-balance fiscal relations between the Center and the states by stalling and even reversing the path of greater fiscal decentralization initiated by the previous Finance Commission
 isse is dharna ko bal mila he ki rajyon kii rajnatik or aarthik swaittata, donon main hi kendrikaran kii disha main kadam badaye ja rahe hai
 The bjp's approach to federalism is based on the ideological definition at the heart of Hindutva
 phir bhi, rashtriya shakti ke rup main apane bade udai ke kaaran bhaajapa ne khud ko sanghavaad main dhaal liya
 During the later stages of Indira Gandhi's tenure, the BJP argued that a strong center as well as strong states were needed to stop the autocratic system
 2014 se pehle ke do dashakon main yah rajya str par thi or bhaajapa ne vishisht rajya-stareey rajnatik or aarthik agenda taiyaar karke apane aadhaar kaa vikaas or vistaar kiya
 The Modi government has got a second term in the 2019 elections due to the Hindu voters of every state and every caste standing firmly behind the BJP
 yah is aadhaar par he ki haal ke dashakon main sanghavaad ke liye apane drushtikon se dur hote hue yah ek rashtrawaad ke adhik shashakt agenda ke saath aage bad rahi he
 This agenda challenges the political and economic autonomy of India's states, while the policy and politics of federalism have important implications associated with the multi-layered concept of citizenship

 pakistan chunaav ayog ne hafiz said kii milli muslim lig (MML) ko raajnneetik dal ke rup main panjikrut karne se inkaar kar diya he
 Therefore, its candidates will no longer contest on the Milli Muslim League ticket
 aatanki hafiz ne apane sanghathan jamaat-ud-daawa kaa naam badalakar milli muslim lig banaai he
 The Milli Muslim League failed to secure security clearance, which led to the Pakistan Election Commission rejecting its registration application
 ab hafiz said ke paas aam chunaav main apane pratyaashiyon ko nirdaleey utaarne yaa phir kisi chote raajnneetik dal se saant-ganth karne ke sivaay koi rasta nahin bachaa he
 He was going to field more than 200 candidates in this general election
 yah pehali baar nahin he, jab pakistan chunaav ayog ne milli muslim lig ke panjikaran ko radd kiya he
 Earlier, the commission had banned the bye-election from the NA-120 seat of Lahore of the Milli Muslim League, after which its candidate had to contest an independent election
 haalanki chunaav ke dauraan is poster or binar main aatanki hafiz said kii tasviir kaa dhadlle se istemaal hua tha
 Hafiz kept changing his organization's name after the 9 / 11 terror attack, so Hafiz Saeed changed the name of his terrorist organization lashkar-e-taiba to dodge the world and renamed it jamaat-ud-dawa

 The 26 November 2008 Mumbai attack killed 166 people and its mastermind Hafiz Mohammed Saeed is number 1 in the list of India's 50 most wanted fugitives that India has repeatedly handed over to Pakistan since 2011

 The government immediately opted out of Vedic

 Vedic told Mail Today that he met Saeed with a 'desire on both sides'

 He tried to understand that he was not a terrorist

 Criminal lawyer Anil Agarwal says, "there is nothing in Vedic's meeting with Hafiz Saeed that is called treason
" unhone na to bharat sarkaar ke prati dushmani kii vakaalat kii or na hi uskaa takhta palatney ko kaha
 "actually Vedic was born in a small business family in Indore
 unke pita arya samaaj se jud gaye jo jaat-paant se mukt samaaj kii vakaalat karata he
 The family was also related to right-wing Hindu Mahasabha and Jana Sangh

 Vedic emigrated from Indore to Delhi after completing his MA in the early 1960s

 His reputation as a well-known Hindi journalist has never been dubious
 ve 1986 se 1995 tak news agency pitii kii hindi news agency bhashaa ke sampadak rahe
 He led the English Hatao Movement in the late 1970s
 dhire-dhire vaidic samaajawaadee party pramukh mulaayam singh yadav se lekar madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan tak kai netaaon ke chahete ho gaye
 However, many of these achievements always dwarfed his appetite for self-propaganda
 kuch saal pehle unhone bhopal main ek dharmik aayojan main ding haank di ki ve apana phone hameshaa bathroom ke kareeb rakhte hai kyonki bharat, pakistan or bangladesh kii sarkaron ke pramukh salaah lene ke liye baar-baar phone karte hai
 Vedic is still the president of the Indian Language Conference which emphasizes the primacy of Indian languages over English
 prabhaat prakaashan ke prabhaat kumaar kaa kahana he, ''vaidic ji prakhar or mazaakia vyakti hai, jinke sabhi dalon ke netaaon se ghanishtha sambandh hai
 “vedic has also made a very long introduction to enhance the image
 unki website par likhaa he, ''doctor vaidic sangharshrat pakshon ko shanti vaarta main madad dekar afghanistan ke maamle main badi bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai

 On June 25, at a dinner hosted by First Secretary Janardan Singh at the Indian High Commission in Islamabad, Vedic asked local journalists how Pakistan reacted when Narendra Modi became Prime Minister
 said se unki mulaakaat apratyaashit dhang se bavaal khadaa karne vaale prachaar kaa hatkandaa bhar ho sakati thi, lekin asal main uske jariye pakistan main satta ke asli centre pakistani sena ne ek mahatvapurn sandesh bheja he
 An Indian intelligence officer said, "lashkar-e-toiba's reinforcements have sent a message that she wants Prime Minister Modi to visit Pakistan
" ” manmohan singh 10 saal pradhanmantri rahete hue kabhi pakistan nahin gaye
 One reason for Manmohan's non-official visit to Pakistan during his second term was the apprehension that Saeed might stage a protest during his visit
 pakistan main 26 november, 2008 ke mumbai hamalon ke mukademon main khaas pragati na hona bhi bhartiya pradhanmantri kii yatra main baadhak rahi he
 On 27 May, Narendra Modi may have accepted Nawaz Sharif's invitation to visit Islamabad, but the security establishment still has this concern in his mind

 Mehmood has claimed that he had asked Saeed to meet an Indian journalist at the request of the Lahore bureau chief
