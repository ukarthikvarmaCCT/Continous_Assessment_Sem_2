 You have been given 63 seats like the '63 Nayanmars (tamil Shaiva Saints)
 usee bhakthi ke saath ye siten aapako sweekaar kar leni chahie, jaisi bhakthi nayanmaron kii thi
 The announcement was made by Karunanidhi after the end of the three-day game of bargaining for seats with the Congress
 kattar naastik dramuk ke mukhiya dwaara dharm kaa zikr karnaa unke bheeshan asuraksha bodh kaa hi pataa detaa he
 This is not the first time Karunanidhi has done politics of intimidation and blackmail with a colleague
 ve isse pehle bhi upie ke saath aisa kar chuke hai or usase pehle rajg ko bhi is ravaie kii jhalak dikhaa chuke hai
 He has always had the art of being successful in bargaining, but this time he seems to have lost the battle with Congress, whatever it may be
 2ji ghotaale kii dramuk or kalaganar ko baari keemat chukaani padi he
 DMK Veteran Chief was given a call by former Telecom Minister A
K
 raja se bhi zyada ab is ghotaale kii aanch apane parivaar par padane kii chintaa sata rahi he
 Discussion is common in Delhi's power corridors that the CBI can now interrogate Karunanidhi's daughter and Rajya Sabha MP Kanimozhi and his wife Rajati in the rapidly expanding scope of the 2G scam investigation
 kanimoli yaa rajati kaa is ghotaale se sidhaa judaav party ke liye bhi or vyaktigat rup se karunanidhi ke liye anarthakaari hoga
 The CBI will present a status report in the Supreme Court on 15 March and a charge sheet on 31 March
 congress or karunanidhi ke bich hui baatcheet ke dauraan upasthit rahe sutara bataate hai ki upie sarkaar se apane mantriyon ko waapas bulaane kii dhamkee dene ke baad karunanidhi sarkaar ke isi aashwaasan par congress kii 63 siton kii maang ke aage jhuke ki 2ji ghotaale kii jaanch main unke parivaar ko pareshaan nahin kiya jayega
 But this assurance from the Congress in difficult times is also not enough
 apni party kii paramparaon se peeche hatate hue tamilnadu kaa pratham parivaar vidhansabha chunaav main jeet ke liye ishwar kii madad or jyotishiyon se salaah maang rahaa he, jabaki 2ji ghotaale se rajya main party kii chhavi kharaab hui he
 In 1960, Karunanidhi, as a top screenwriter, wrote fiery dialogues in films one after the other, through which a strong message of logic and wisdom went to the audience
 unhone kai andhvishwaason par bhi tikhe sawaal kiye the
 This was in line with the Dravidian movement, whose foundation was built on the ideology of rationality
 jabaki aaj kuch logon ke anusaar, dramuk ke vahi mukhiya jyotishi kii salaah par pili shawl odhate hai
 Astrologers have not only Karunanidhi running for advice
 dramuk netaa ke duusare parivaar (patni dayaalu or betaa em
 K
 stallin) or tisare parivaar ne bhi (patni rajati or beti kanimoli) jyotishiyon se salaah lee he
 The prediction of one of his family astrologers hardly brought any relief for the family in distress
 ek paariwarik jyotishi ne india today ko naam na chhapane kii shart par bataaya, ''maine kai saal pehle hi dramuk ke is patan kii bhavishyavaanee kar di thi
 Considering the position of the planets, i advised them to do special puja in some famous temples, so that the effect of the planets is lessened
 '' unka kahana he ki haalanki karunanidhi ke grah ab achche hai, lekin unke bete stallin or beti kanimoli ke grahon main jeet ke sanket nahin dikhaai de rahe
 Recently Rajati has started a religious journey across the state
 ek saptaah pehle unhone thirunelaveli ke prasiddh nelgayppar mandir main puja kii
 He visited the temple along with state IT minister Poongotai Alladi Aruna and offered prayers in front of Sri Gandhimati Devi and Lord Nellayappar (shiva)
 ve vahaan 50 minute rukeen or us dauraan vahaan ke pujaariyon ne archana or vishesh deeparadhana kii
 During her visit, she also visited the Nava Tirupati (nine Holy Vaishnavas) temple near Tirunelveli
 karunanidhi pichley saal se duusare andhvishwaason kaa paalan kar rahe hai
 He attended the millennium celebrations of the huge Thanjavur temple in 2010, though he did not use the temple's main gate then to avoid political controversy
 bataaya jaataa he ki is mandir ke mukhya dwaar se pravesh karne par indira gandhi ko satta khoni padi thi, jabaki em
 Yes
 ramchandran ko dil kaa daura padaa tha
 Since then, the leaders use the side door to come to this temple
 haal kii ghatnaon se karunanidhi ke vanshajon main badhati dharmik aasthaa kaa hi pataa chalata he
 During the Lok Sabha elections in 2009, the son of DMK chief and MP from Madurai M
 ke
 Alagiri started his election campaign with a famous temple and was also honored by that temple
 kanimoli kuch hi maheene pehle vikhyath vaishnav mandir shrirangam gai thim
 She also performed pooja there in 2010 when she went to the Millennium Celebration of Punnainnallur Mariammam Temple in Thanjavur with her mother Rajati
 karunanidhi ke uttaradhikari or rajya ke upmukhyamantri stallin ne pichley dinon satya sai baba ke darshan kar unka aashirwad liya
 Rajati also touched his feet
 kalaganar ne pichley dinon mata amritanandmayi or isha foundation ke jaggi vasudev ke darshan kiye
 When Karunanidhi was asked the reason for reconciliation with religious and spiritual leaders, his reply was that it is not wrong to keep in touch with religious leaders who work for the welfare of the people
 dramuk ke chunaav abhiyaan main hindu mithkeey aakhyaanon ke roopak mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai- aisi kai misaalen hai, jab bhagavadgita se prerana lekar party ke chunavi postaron main karunanidhi or stallin ko kramshah bhagwaan krishna or arjuna ke rup main dikhaaya gaya
 Earlier, the DMK used religious metaphors to publicize its government programs
 aktubar, 2009 main akhabaaron main sarkaar kii ek bahuddeshy medical insurance yojana kii shuruyaat kaa vigyaapan diya gaya, jisamen mrityu ke devtaa 'yama' ko ek majboot sand kii peeth par baithe hue mrityu shaiya par pade ek buudhe aadmi kii taraf ek rassi phenkate dikhaaya gaya tha
 But before that rope reaches that old, wearing a full-sleeved white shirt and a pale shawl that bears a slight hint of cloak, one hand grabs the rope to save the sick man
 vigyaapan bataata he, ''kalamavisum keietrei tadukka kalaganar kapitu thittem,' yani yama kii rassi ko beasar karne ke liye kalaganar insurance skim
 In fact, it is the Congress which has defeated the last gimmick of 86-year-old Karunanidhi, who played a long innings of politics
 bhrashtachar ke khulaase ke baad apni party or e
 The DMK chief, who is in trouble for defending Raja, should now hope that his over-dramatics will help raise the morale of the party at all levels
 congress ke saath karunanidhi kii saudebaaji se party kaaryakartaaon main yah sandesh gaya hi hoga ki yah dramuk hi he, jo congress ko hilaane kii takat rakhti he, isliye siton ke bantwaare main dramuk kaa rukh hi nirnaayak rahaa he
 The assurance received by Karunanidhi from Congress in the 2G scam investigation case does not matter much as the CBI is reporting directly to the Supreme Court in this investigation
 lekin dramuk mukhiya ke paas vikalp simit hi hai
 Jayalalithaa is expected to lose her hands
 2ji ghotaale main aropit hone ke baad unke virdohi unke parivaar ke khilaaf kadam uthaaenge
 At the same time, losing power at the center will also mean more breakdown
 yahi vah paridrishy he, jahaan karunanidhi, unki patniyon, beton or beti ko bachaa paanaa bhagwaan ke liye bhi mushkil he
 Karunanidhi must have understood this bitter reality after six decades of politics when he accepted the Congress's 'irrational' demand for 63 seats on 8 March

 kya samaajawaadee party or congress ke bich gathbandhan ko lekar chal rahi baat tut gai he yaa phir akhilesh yadav ke netritv main sapa apni sambhavit sahyogi party ke khilaaf dabaav kii ranneeti kaa istemaal kar rahi he? ye sawaal isliye uth rahaa he kyonki akhilesh yadav ne aaj pehali list main jin 191 ummidavaaron ke naam jari kiye unamem un siton par bhi ummidavaar ghoshit kar die gaye hai jinpar pichhali baar congress ne jeet hasil kii thi or wo congress kii demand list main shaamil thim
 However, SP Vice President Kiranmoy Nanda says that we can give 84-89 seats to the Congress
 18 ummidavaaron kii duusari list jarivahin shuukravaar shaam sapa ne 18 ummidavaaron kii duusari list bhi jari kar di
 In which Rakesh Verma, son of senior leader Beni Prasad Verma, has been given ticket from Kaiserganj in Bahraich
 is list main sapa main jari kalah ke dauraan akhilesh samarthak rahe pawan pandey ko faijabad ke ayodhya seat par utaara gaya he
 Pawan Pandey was accused of grappling with Ashu Malik
 iske baad unhen shivpal yadav ne party ne barkhaast kar diya tha, haalanki ve akhilesh cabinet main mantri pad rahe
 Shivpal's son has not been nominated from Faizabad, Abhay Singh from Gosaiganj seat and Anand Sen from Bikapur seat have been declared candidates
 is tarah ab tak jari kii gai list main benny prasad verma, naresh agarwal or ajam khan ke beton ko tikat de diya he
 However, Shivpal Yadav's son Aditya Yadav is yet to get a ticket on any seat
 muslim ummidavaaron kii di ja rahi variyatabeni prasad verma, naresh agarwal or ajam khan ke beton ko tikat diya he
 The names of six Muslim and two Dalit candidates have been announced in the second list of 18 candidates released by the SP
 pehali or duusari list ko milakar ab tak samaajawaadee party ne 209 siton par apane ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 There are 56 Muslim, 41 Dalit and 22 Yadav candidates
 is tarah se sapa kii ab tak ghoshit list main 26
 5 percent Muslims, 19
 6 fisadi dalit or 10
 52 per cent Yadavs are candidates
 akhilesh yadavaki list main mathura, khurja, hapur, shamali, syana, swaar-tanda par sapa ne ummidavaar ghoshit kar die hai
 CLP Pradeep Mathur of Congress from Mathura is a 4-time MLA, while Banshi Pahadia from Khurja, Gajraj Singh from Hapur and Pankaj Malik from Shamli are Congress mlas
 syana se congress vidhayak dilnavaaj khan haal hi main party chhod basapa main shaamil ho chuke hai
 The Congress was willing to give this seat to the SP, but was seeking a second seat in return
 congress kii sitting swaar seat se ajam khan ke bete ko sapa kaa tikat mila he jabaki is seat se congress ke tikat par nawab kazim ali jite the, jo haal main basapa chale gaye
 The Congress was willing to give up this seat in Rampur district, but wanted Chamrauah seat in return
 sapa ne donon siton se ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 Akhilesh Yadav did not give up the seats of Noida, Ghaziabad, while the Congress was seeking urban seats here
 vahiin meerut main bhi siten ghoshit kar congress ko jhatka diya gaya he kyonki, yahaan bhi congress kii nazar shahari seat par thi
 This is the reason that as soon as the list is made public, questions are being raised on the congress-sp alliance
 mana ja rahaa he ki yaa to gathbandhan kii baat tut gai he yaa akhilesh congress ko dabaav main lekar apni baat manvaanaa chaahate hai
 Shivpal Yadav has been given ticket from Jaswant Nagar Etawah
 sutron ke mutabik wo ab bhi chunaav ladane ke icchhuk nahin hai lekin mulaayam ne unase baat kii he
 Shivpal Yadav's son has not got the ticket while Azam Khan and Naresh Aggarwal's son are on the list
 ajam khan ke bete abdulla ajam ko ramnagar, swaar se tikat mila he jabaki nitin ko hardoi se
 The SP has divided all the seats in Noida, Ghaziabad to the candidates while the Congress was eyeing Sahibabad and Noida

 Now the role of the bank officials and the rest of the people who made the leaked paper viral in this case is under investigation
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne 27 agast ko bhaajapa shasit rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon kii or 23 agast ko sabhi rajyon ke santhnik kor samoohon kii baithak bulaai he
 In these meetings, issues such as better coordination between the government and the party, promotion of "pro-poor" initiatives and increasing use of digital media can be discussed
 shah kii ore se ek ke baad ek baithken karne kaa yah faisla rajyasabha main jiesti vidheyak paarit ho jane kii prishthbhumi main aayaa he
 The bill is expected to be passed in the Lok Sabha next week
 haalanki party ke sutron ne is baat par jor diya ki in baithkon kii vajah jiesti vidheyak nahin he kyonki yah centre or rajyon ke bich kaa maamla he
 Organizational matters will remain at the top of Shah's agenda
 sutron ne kaha ki agenda main mukhya muddon main sarkaar or party ke bich behatar samanvay karnaa, modi sarkaar kii ‘‘garib-samarthit or kamjor tabakon kii pakshdhar’’ pahalon ko badhaava dena or party evam sarkaar ke agenda ko badhaava dene ke liye digital media kaa istemaal badhanaa shaamil he
 Sources said that the issue of implementation of GST could figure in the discussions as Shah believes that its passage in Parliament will be a significant achievement and the governments of the party ruled states should do their best to make it successful
 
 party adhyaksh elahabaad main party kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main liye gaye faislon ke kriyanvayan kii bhi samiksha karenge
 In states where the party is traditionally weak, it will take stock of the efforts being made by the organization to expand the party's base

 ) The decision by Shah to hold one-to-one meetings came against the backdrop of the passage of the GST Bill in the Rajya Sabha

 However, party sources insisted that the reason for these meetings is not the GST Bill as it is a matter between the Center and the states
 shah ke agenda main santhnik maamle sheersh par rahenge
 Sources said that the main issues on the agenda include better coordination between the government and the party, promoting the Modi government's "pro-poor and vulnerable sections" initiatives and digital media to promote the party and the government's agenda Includes increasing use of

 The party president will also review the implementation of the decisions taken at the party's national executive meeting in Allahabad
 jin rajyon main party paaramparik rup se kamjor he, unamem party ke aadhaar ko vistaar dene ke liye sanghathan kii ore se kiye ja rahe prayaason kaa vah jayja lenge

 ) jharkhand sarkaar ne vaise aksham karmchaariyon or adhikariyon ko chinhit karne kaa kaam shuru kar diya he jinaki vajah se sarkari kaamkaaj prabhavit hota he
 Also, the government has started taking action against them
 beete saptaah bhartiya prashasnic seva ke adhikari sant kumaar verma ko svaichhik sevanivritti dene kaa faisla liya gaya tha
 Actually, Verma was posted as Special Secretary in the Welfare Department
 pichley dedh saal se ve chuttee par chal rahe the
 Troubled, the state government started the process of giving him mandatory retirement
 notice milane ke baad verma ne beemaari ke kaaran svaichhik sevanivritti kaa aavedan diya tha
 It was accepted immediately
 duty par nasha karne waalon par bhi gir sakati he gajasarkaar ke radar par duty par sharaab pine vaale adhikari bhi hai
 The government believes that this affects government functioning
 aise afasaron se bhi sarkaar jald hi tauba karne kii yojana main he
 The Department of Personnel, Administrative Reforms and Official Language has written a letter to all departmental secretaries, principal secretaries, commissioners and deputy commissioners, asking them to prepare a list of such drunk officers and employees
 iske alaava vibhaagon se aksham logon kii pahchaan karne ko bhi kaha gaya he
 The process of action will begin after the recommendation from departmental heads
 rajya sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki aise afasaron ke kaaran rajya kii chhavi par bhi kharaab asar padataa he
 So the only option is to forcibly retire them
 mukhyamantri khud kar rahe hai nigaraneenichle str ke karmchaaree se lekar bhartiya prashasnic seva ke adhikariyon ke kaamkaaj kii nigaraanee kii ja rahi he
 Chief Minister Raghuvar Das himself has asked to identify the negligents during departmental meetings

 ' salmaan khan ke sho 'big bos' main ek nayaa mode aane vaala he
 It has been heard that a wedding is going to take place in Bigg Boss house
 nahin, yah kisi task kaa hissaa nahin he
 But this can happen in reality
 khabar he ki bhojpuri actress or 'big bos 10' kii pratiyogimonaalisajald hi apane bwoyfriend vikrant singh rajput se shaadi karne ja rahi hai
 Earlier it was discussed that these two will take seven rounds after coming out of Mona's house but now it is being said that they will be married in the house of 'bigg Boss'
 'big bos' kii is hot contestant kii tasviren kya dekhi hai aapane
 
 
 This news is surprising because Mona and Vikrant had a lot of estrangement on one stage during the show itself
 isaki vajah thi manu or mona ke bich kii nazdikiyaan
 It was then being told who Monalisa had done to Manu
 haalanki ye donon yahi daawa karte rahe ki ve bas achche dost hai
 Coming out of 'bigg Boss', Swami Om's colors are like this
 
 
 baharhaal jab sho par vikrant ko bulaayaa gaya to bahut si galatchhemiyaan dur ho gayi or vikrant yah tay kar chuke the ki mona kebig boske ghar se baahar aate hi ve donon shaadi kar lenge
 But when they got a chance to get married on National TV in the house of 'bigg Boss', they quickly said that this happened when Nitibha's closeness with Dimanveer was growing up
 
 
 vikrant kaa kahana he, 'jab main ek task ke dauraan big bos ke ghar main jaakar mona se mila tab mujhe ehsaas hua ki main mona ko kitna miss kar rahaa tha
 i love Mona very much and there is no way i can express it other than marrying her in front of the whole world
 ''big bos' main govinda sang kii salmaan ne masti
 
 
 Well before this, actress Sara Khan and Ali Merchant also got married in Bigg Boss house
 lekin unka rishta zyada din tik nahin sakaa
 In such a situation, our wish is that Mona and Vikrant stay together for seven lives

 lekin mosul kii galiyon main bhatakate hue unhen jab samaj main nahin aayaa ki kya karen to unhone ek anjaan ghar ke daravaaje kii ghanti baja di or madad kii guhaar lagaai
 However, it is not the case that he has received help from unknown people every time

 har baar jab aap iske bare main kehete hai, aap use manjar ko jaise phir se ji rahe hote hai
 It used to happen many times that you were constantly raped
 aapako nahin pataa hota tha ki aglaa koun darwaja kholegaa or aapke saath rape karegaa

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) If senior Congress leader Ajay Maken believes BJP President Amit Shah is appealing to his own candidates not to vote! It sounds astonishing to hear, but Ajay Maken has shared a similar video viral on social media with his Twitter handle
 Its very strange-bjp President Sh Amit Shah himself says that do not vote for Meenakshi lekhi!then why should anyone vote for Lekhi ji?please watch this video sent by@kundra_vishal👇pic
 twitter
 com / varxubbixa— Ajay Maken (@ajaymaken)may 2, 2019is video main amit shah kehete sunai dete hai ki hamaare donon saansad pratyaashee minakshi lekhi or ramesh bidhudi ko ek bhi kaam ke liye vot mat dena
 In this video of about 18 seconds, Amit Shah also says that being the President of BJP, i ask that my two candidates do not vote
 ajay makanne hairaani jataate hue likhaa he ki bijepi adhyaksh khud hi kah rahe hai ki minakshi lekhi ko vot na karen to koi kyon karegaa
 In the tweet itself, Maken also clarified that this video was sent to him by @ kundra_vishal
 maakan ke video ko dilli congress ne bhi like kiya he
 Meenakshi Lekhi is the BJP candidate from New Delhi seat and she is pitted against Ajay Maken in this seat
 india today ke anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne padtaal main paaya ki viral ho rahaa video bhraamak he
 This video is incomplete, due to which the meaning of Amit Shah's talk has been lost
 maakan ke twit kaa archivd varjanayahandekha ja saktaa he
 People are also sharing this video on Facebook
 video main amit shah kah rahe hai: ‘magar hamaare ye donon saansad pratyaashee hai, bahan lekhi he or ramesh bidhudi he, ye ek bhi kaam ke liye donon ko vot mat dena, main kahata hum aapako, bijepi kaa adhyaksh ho kar kahata hum mere donon pratyaashee ko ye ek bhi kaam ke liye vot mat dena
 AFWA found that the video going viral is part of Amit Shah's rally held in Vasant Kunj, Delhi on 1 May
 bijepi ke utyub channel par hamen raily kaa puraa video mila
 Listening to the video shows that Amit Shah is telling the people about the achievements of the Modi government, that they have to vote not only for the work of their mps, but also for Modi because Modi has protected the country
 
 is video main 1:20:06 par shah ko kehete suna ja saktaa he: ‘mitron, narendra modi sarkaar ne dher saare kaam kiye, garibon ke liye bahut saare kaam kiye, ghar diya, bijli diya, shauchalay diya, gas kaa conection diya, shuddh pine kaa pani diya, dilli ke liye bhi bahut sari chijen deen
 But these two mps of ours are candidates, sister is Lekhi and Ramesh is Bidhuri, do not vote for both of them for a single job, i say you are the President of BJP and tell my two candidates to vote for a single job
 do not give
 dilli ke liye ek lakh karod rupye modi ji ne kharch kara he, uske liye bhi vot nahin dena he unako, nahin dena he, inako vot jarur dena modi ji ne desh ko surakshit kiya he isliye vot dena, desh ko surakshit kiya he
 'boomlive has also revealed the truth of this viral video
 yahaan dekhen bhaashan kaa video —saaf he ki amit shah ne bijepi pratyaashiyon ke liye vot karne se manaa nahin kiya he
 a portion of the video speech has been cut out
 kya kejariwal sarkaar uske vigyapanon main jhuthe daawey kar rahi he? kya kejariwal sarkaar dilli waalon ke paise bhraamak vigyapanon main barabaad kar rahi he? ye sawaal isliye uth rahe hai kyoki dilli bijepi ne somvaar ko press conference kar kejariwal sarkaar par vigyapanon main jhooth bolne kaa aarope lagaaya
 On Monday, at Delhi BJP headquarters, Delhi BJP General Ministers Kuljit Singh Chahal and Rajesh Bhatia as well as Vice President Rajiv Babbar left Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Congress State President Ajay Maken to mislead the people of Delhi for the development of better and better Delhi
 Asked to work for MCD chunaav aate hi yaad ai dilhipress conference main kulajit singh chahal ne kaha ki emsidi chunaav najadik aate hi lagbhag 2 saal se laapata rahe siem kejariwal ko achaanak dilli kii chintaa sata rahi he or dilli sarkaar apni duusari saalagirah ke bahaane bhraamak vigyaapan jari kar rahi he
 In which false claims are being made by the Delhi government such as passing Jan Lokpal, giving compensation of 5 lakhs to Sikh riot victims
 manoj tiwari ne jhuggiyon or avaidh coloniyon main raaten guzarirajesh bhaatia ne kaha ki kejariwal sarkaar kaa ek pramukh vaada tha or aajkal vah apane vigyapanon main dilli ko puraa evam svachh pani dene kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 Whereas all this happened after Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari did a reality check
 bhaatia ne bataaya ki manoj tiwari ne jhuggiyon or avaidh coloniyon main raaten guzari thim
 During this time the local people had made them aware of the shortage of water even in winter
 kejariwal ne sikhon kii bhaawanaaon ke saath khilwaad kiyaupadhyaksh rajeev babbar ne bada aarope lagaate hue kaha ki kejariwal ne sikhon kii bhaawanaaon ke saath bhi khilwaad kiya he
 Babbar alleged that as soon as the Center came to power in 2014, the Modi government had announced an additional compensation of Rs 5 lakh per family for the victims of the 1984 anti-sikh riots, and Home Minister Rajnath Singh himself gave 21 families the year 2015
 In one program, checks were also given
 aage kaa kaam dilli sarkaar ko karnaa tha par lagbhag 10 maheene tak kejariwal sarkaar maamle ko dabaaye baithi rahi or bijepi ke kade virodh ke baad november 2016 main check jari kiye gaye
 Babbar claimed that the Kejriwal government was claiming in the advertisement that he had given this compensation whereas the truth is that it was given by the BJP
 manoj tiwari ne bataaya sapanom kaa saudagardilli bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko sapanom kaa saudagar bataaya
 He said these things on Kejriwal's claim that he had made Delhi like London
 manoj tiwari ne aarope lagaaya ki kejariwal ne dilli ke liye koi kaam nahin kiya
 Tiwari said that Kejriwal betrayed Delhi politically and left the people of Delhi to his corrupt ministers and continued to expand his party with Delhi money
 tiwari ne kataaksh karte hue kaha ki dilli ko landan banane ke sapane se pehle kejariwal ne haal hi main hue punjab ke chunaavon main punjab ko canada banane kii baat kii thi jise dekhakar lag rahaa he ki arvind kejariwal sapanom ke saudagar ban gaye hai
 Manoj Tiwari also accused Ajay Maken
 tiwari ne kaha ki emsidi kii haalat ke liye tatkaaleen congress sarkarein bhi utani hi jimmedaar hai jitani vartmaan kejariwal sarkaar
 Tiwari has asked 2 questions to the Congress
 
 
 1- 2004 se 2007 tak congress sarkaar kendra, dilli or nagar nigam teenon jagah satta main thi or ajay maakan us sarkaar kaa hissaa the, tab aisa kuch prayaas kyon nahin kiya jo aaj kar rahe hai?2- 2012 main nigam vibhaajan congress ne kiya par tab bhi aarthik sudridhtaa par dhyaan nahin diya or na hi purvi dilli nagar nigam ko seed mani di gai
 Ajay Maken was then a minister in the Central Government and p Chidambaram was the Finance Minister of the country
 
 
 aaj agar aap donon ke paas nigamon ke liye aarthik vijan he, jab aap khud donon mantri the tab us samay kaam kyon nahin kiya? Taking a sarcasm at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday tweeted and prayed for him that he should get freedom from ignorance
 ek din pehle pradhanmantri modi ne kaha tha ki british shashan ke tahat congress ne jo dushwariyaan jheli thim, bhaajapa ko usase kahin adhik aaazaad bharat main pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa

 pyaare rocky yadav, It is yet to be proved by the court, so the killer Rocky Yadav is not writing
 adaalat ke faisale kaa intazaar karuunga or tab tak kathith likhuunga, so, tumko tab tak pyaare likhuunga, taaki tum jaise naujavaanon ko ahsaas ho ki aditya bhi kisi kaa pyaara tha
 What you are saying on TV that you were in Delhi, you did not fire
 is tarah ke bayaan tumhaare jaise kathith aaropee dete rahe hai
 Such dialogues are common in films and even fake lawyers claiming to prove the murderer innocent on this basis
 police kii jaanch tumhaare bayaan se alag he
 The police say that you have confessed and the weapon with which the murder took place has been recovered, so you are accused and not the murderer till the court's decision
 tumhaari maa thik hi kah rahi hongi ki tum us tarah ke ladke nahin ho
 Nowadays, like films, we are watching the gimmick of mothers everyday in politics
 raajnneeti kii maanon ko samajhnaa chahie ki unke aansu javed akhtar sahab vaali maanon ke aansu jaise nahin hai, na ho sakate hai
 Nowadays, many ministers and legislators are covering every thing with the gimmick of 'I am also a mother'
 yah sabase bada jhooth he ki ek maa duusari maa ko jaanati he
 The truth is that there is a lot of difference between the pain of Rocky's mother and Aditya's mother
 rohit vemula kii maa or kisi mantri ke maa hone main bahut antar he
 Your mother may look forward to returning from prison
 aditya kii maa aas nahin laga sakati he, isliye apni maa se kaho ki 'maa maa' band kare
 If your mother understands the pain of mothers, then she does not let you take a revolver of millions of rupees
 maanon kaa sapana beton ko revolver dena nahin hota he
 Gun, gun, your name is also like the trick of the locality
 kair, iskaa ghatana se koi taalluq nahin he
 The police says that you have a car worth ten million
 20 kii umr main tum ek karod kii car chalaate ho! zaahir he tumhaari maa na to tumhen ek acha ladkaa bana rahi thi, na duusari maataaon ke bare main soch rahi thi
 Information about your partner will also show that you have been sitting in your relationship
 tumhen revolver kaa license dilwane main kisne madad kii
 Have heard that the sons of politicians of many parties are your friends
 paisa he, to koun mitra nahin hoga tumhaara
 Obviously, your mother would not have given you a crore car and a revolver of lakhs to be a good son
 tum achche hote to revolver lekar aisi tasviir nahin khinchaate
 You try to look like an Olympian, but you are not looking
 rocky, tum jis rajya ke chhutbhaiya hero ho, main vahiin se metric paas hum
 Many Rocky's fathers like you are mlas, are contractors, are in the police
 har dal ke khandaanon main tum jaise hai
 We call such a hero a 'tinhaiya' hero - that is, the road
 hamaari raajnneeti main ye jo badi gaadiyaan ai hai, unase bahuton kaa dimaag karaab hua he
 Everywhere people save brakes on the road, people get brakes by applying brakes
 dilli main to rose dekhtaa hum
 People get hit by a car and continue to fight
 sheesha neeche kar dhamkaate rahete hai
 Do you know you are the same main kanoonee faisalaa nahin kar rahaa
 Socially analyzing your antics main bilkul samajhataa hum ki road rej ek gambhir manorog he
 Several incidents have been recorded, including murder
 tumhen dilli main doctor naarang kii hatya kaa maamla yaad hi hoga
 Like many people, you too must have felt angry
 tum bardaasht nahin kar sake hoge ki paanch lakh kii swift car ek karod kii range rover car ko kaise overtek kar sakati he
 Son Rocky is also a skill driving car
 moped vaala bhi maat de saktaa he
 Had he understood this much, he would have tolerated the shock of overtake and let Aditya go
 magar tumhen 'rej' aayaa, yani gussa aayaa
 You should not get psychiatric relaxation like road rage
 tum ek raajnneetik khandaan se aate ho
 Father is leader of RJD and mother is JDU MLA
 suna he, pita bahubali kahalaane kii yogyata bhi rakhte hai, isliye tumhen lagata hoga ki ghar main hi lalu yadav or nitish kumaar hai

 kuch putr log sajjan bhi hote hai, magar zyaadaatar rocky or viki kii maansikta se aage nikal nahin pate
 i have a classmate whose father was a minister for many years
 shaayad ab bhi honge, magar vah kabhi bataata hi nahin tha ki pita mantri hai
 Used to come to college by bicycle
 to rocky, tumhaare bheetar satta kaa gurur bhi aayaa hoga
 You stopped the car and quarreled with that
 tumhaara gussa saatven aasmaan par gaya hoga or tumne kathith rup se goli maar di, isliye tumhaara maamla alag he
 i appeal to the Chief Minister of Bihar to show this case to its conclusion within two months
 tumhaari ek karod kii car kabad main bechakar uske paise se kisi gaanv main kuan khudva den
 Due to the politics which had boosted your spirits, today the same politics will see that your case will be decided soon
 aisa hone se bihar main netaaon ke bahut se rocky batch jaaenge, ve raste par aa jaaenge
 It would be a greater justice to kill Aditya than going to jail
 tumhaari mata kii sadsyta radd kar kisi dhang ke yuva ko emelsi banaaen
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar or the speaker of Bihar Legislative Assembly should call a two-day conference for mlas of all parties and their immediate families where social training should be imparted from member to driver
 bataane ke liye ki vidhayak or parivaar ke bich kis tarah ke sambandh hone chahie
 How the public conduct of the MLA can discredit the family and how the conduct of the family to the MLA
 sadasyon se badi gadiyon kii tamaam jaankaree maangi jaae or poocha jaae ki aapke alaava parivaar ke kitne sadasyon ke paas aisi gaadi he
 The members should be told how to behave when the car collides with the car of an ordinary citizen or does an overtake
 mantri yaa vidhayak kii panjikrut car ke bheetar ek sandesh chipkaaya janaa chahie ki yah vidhayak kii car he
 Car is not an MLA
 driver or parivaar ke sadsy aukaat main rahen
 Congratulations to the SSP of Gaya Police, but nothing is going to happen in one case

 tippaniyan a citizen of your state raveesh kumaar Your mother must be rightly saying that you are not that kind of boy
 aajkal filmon kii tarah raajnneeti main maanon kii nautanki ham log rose dekh rahe hai
 Mothers of politics should understand that their tears are not like the tears of Javed Akhtar Saheb's mothers, they cannot be
 aajkal kai mantri or vidhayak har baat ko 'main bhi ek maa hum' kii nautanki se dhankane lagi hai
 It is the biggest lie that one mother knows the other mother
 satya yah he ki rocky kii maa or aditya kii maa ke dard main bahut fark he
 There is a lot of difference between Rohit Vemula's mother and a minister's mother
 tumhaari maa jail se laut aane kii aas laga sakati he
 Aditya's mother cannot wait, so tell your mother to stop 'maa maa'
 tumhaari maa agar maanon kaa dard samajhatin to tumhen lakhon rupee kaa revolver lene nahin detii
 Mothers do not dream of giving revolvers to sons
 bandook to bandook, tumhaara naam bhi mohalle ke chaliya jaisaa he
 Anyway, it has nothing to do with the incident
 police kahati he ki tumhaare naam par ek karod kii car he
 At the age of 20 you drive a crore car! Obviously, your mother was neither making you a good boy, nor thinking of other mothers
 tumhaare sangi-saathi ke bare main jaankaree se bhi pataa chalegaa ki tum kinaki sohabat main uthte-baithte rahe ho
 Who helped you get a revolver license
 suna he ki kai dalon ke rajanetaaon ke putr tumhaare mitra hai
 If you have money, who will not be your friend? zaahir he, tumhaari maa ne tumhen acha betaa banane ke liye ek karod kii car or lakhon kii revolver nahin di hogi
 If you were good, do not take such a picture with a revolver
 koshish to tumhaari olympian jaise dikhne kii he, magar lag nahin rahe ho
 Rocky, i am a matriculate from the state where you are a small-time hero
 tumhaare jaise anek rocky ke papa vidhayak hai, thekedaar hai, police main hai
 You are like a part of each party's family
 aise hero ko ham 'tinahaia' hero kehete hai - matlab sadakchhaap
 Many of these big vehicles have come into our politics, many have lost their minds
 sadak par in gadiyon ko bachaane main har jagah log brake lagaakar logon ko gariyaate mil jate hai
 i look every day in Delhi
 log car se utarkar marpet karte rahete hai
 They keep threatening under the glass
 kya pataa tum bhi vaise hi ho
 i am not making a legal decision
 tumhaari harkaton kaa saamaajik vishleshan kar rahaa hum
 i absolutely understand that road rage is a serious psychiatry
 kai ghatnaayen darj hai, jinamein hatya bhi hui he
 You will remember the case of Dr
 Narang's murder in Delhi

 Anyway, it has nothing to do with the incident
 police kahati he ki tumhaare naam par ek karod kii car he
 At the age of 20 you drive a crore car! Obviously, your mother was neither making you a good boy, nor thinking of other mothers
 tumhaare sangi-saathi ke bare main jaankaree se bhi pataa chalegaa ki tum kinaki sohabat main uthte-baithte rahe ho
 Who helped you get a revolver license

 Rocky, i am a matriculate from the state where you are a small-time hero
 tumhaare jaise anek rocky ke papa vidhayak hai, thekedaar hai, police main hai
 You are like a part of each party's family
 aise hero ko ham 'tinahaia' hero kehete hai - matlab sadakchhaap
 Many of these big vehicles have come into our politics, many have lost their minds
 sadak par in gadiyon ko bachaane main har jagah log brake lagaakar logon ko gariyaate mil jate hai
 i look every day in Delhi
 log car se utarkar marpet karte rahete hai
 They keep threatening under the glass

 Everywhere people save brakes on the road, people get brakes by applying brakes

 People get hit by a car and continue to fight
 sheesha neeche kar dhamkaate rahete hai
 Do you know you are the same main kanoonee faisalaa nahin kar rahaa
 Socially analyzing your antics main bilkul samajhataa hum ki road rej ek gambhir manorog he
 Several incidents have been recorded, including murder
 tumhen dilli main doctor naarang kii hatya kaa maamla yaad hi hoga
 Like many people, you too must have felt angry
 tum bardaasht nahin kar sake hoge ki paanch lakh kii swift car ek karod kii range rover car ko kaise overtek kar sakati he
 Son Rocky is also a skill driving car
 moped vaala bhi maat de saktaa he
 Had he understood this much, he would have tolerated the shock of overtake and let Aditya go
 magar tumhen 'rej' aayaa, yani gussa aayaa
 You should not get psychiatric relaxation like road rage
 tum ek raajnneetik khandaan se aate ho
 Father is leader of RJD and mother is JDU MLA

 i have a classmate whose father was a minister for many years
 shaayad ab bhi honge, magar vah kabhi bataata hi nahin tha ki pita mantri hai
 Used to come to college by bicycle
 to rocky, tumhaare bheetar satta kaa gurur bhi aayaa hoga
 You stopped the car and quarreled with that
 tumhaara gussa saatven aasmaan par gaya hoga or tumne kathith rup se goli maar di, isliye tumhaara maamla alag he
 i appeal to the Chief Minister of Bihar to show this case to its conclusion within two months
 tumhaari ek karod kii car kabad main bechakar uske paise se kisi gaanv main kuan khudva den
 Due to the politics which had boosted your spirits, today the same politics will see that your case will be decided soon
 aisa hone se bihar main netaaon ke bahut se rocky batch jaaenge, ve raste par aa jaaenge
 It would be a greater justice to kill Aditya than going to jail
 tumhaari mata kii sadsyta radd kar kisi dhang ke yuva ko emelsi banaaen
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar or the speaker of Bihar Legislative Assembly should call a two-day conference for mlas of all parties and their immediate families where social training should be imparted from member to driver
 bataane ke liye ki vidhayak or parivaar ke bich kis tarah ke sambandh hone chahie
 How the public conduct of the MLA can discredit the family and how the conduct of the family to the MLA
 sadasyon se badi gadiyon kii tamaam jaankaree maangi jaae or poocha jaae ki aapke alaava parivaar ke kitne sadasyon ke paas aisi gaadi he
 The members should be told how to behave when the car collides with the car of an ordinary citizen or does an overtake
 mantri yaa vidhayak kii panjikrut car ke bheetar ek sandesh chipkaaya janaa chahie ki yah vidhayak kii car he
 Car is not an MLA
 driver or parivaar ke sadsy aukaat main rahen
 Congratulations to the SSP of Gaya Police, but nothing is going to happen in one case
 noujvaan esaspi ko bhi aise gaadivaanon kaa shivi lagaakar bataanaa chahie ki yah car, jo aapane khridi he, vah dekhne main badi he, magar isamen baithkar aap kanoon se bade nahin ho jate

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made an important announcement in this year's budget
 unhone long turm capital gains par tex lagaae jane kii ghoshnaa kii he
 After this, many questions and doubts are arising in the minds of people about LTCG
 isamen kuch log yah jaananaa chaahate hai ki LTCG tex kya he or yah kin logon ko bharna hoga
 Along with this, many questions are being asked about how long it will be taxed
 isko dekhte hue iskar vibhaag ne altisiji tex or is par lagane vaale tex ko lekar aam logon kii shankaaon ko dur karne kii koshish kii he
 The Income Tax Department has answered similar questions
 kya he LTCG tex?ltcg athwa long turm capital gains tex vah tex hota he, jo kisi sampati athwa share sambandhi utpaada se hasil kiye gaye profit par lagata he
 LTCG is available on products that you get after investing for a long period
 haalanki utpaada ke hisaab se us par lagane vaala LTCG tex bhi alag-alag hota he
 Which stocks will be taxed? How much tax will the Income Tax Department take on LTCG tax and how do you have to pay it? isaki puri jaankaree di he
 The Income Tax Department has clarified that LTCG tax has been announced in the budget
 yah tex un sheyaron par hi lagegaa, jo 1 april, 2018 ke baad beche gaye hai
 Tax will not be levied on them: The Income Tax Department has said that LTCG tax will be exempt on shares purchased between February 1 and March 31, 2018
 yah chhot inakam tex act ke section 10 ke cloj 38 ke tahat milegi
 The department has given this answer to remove the doubt that it was feared that this tax would be levied on all the shares purchased on February 1 and thereafter
 inhen bhi milegaa tex benefitakar vibhaag ne saaf kiya he ki ek farvari 2018 se lekar 31 march, 2018 ke bich kiye gaye transfar par tex benefit milegaa
 However, the long term capital loss during this period can neither be fixed nor carry forward
 in companiyon ke sheyaron par lagegaa texcapital gains tex un companiyon ke equity sheyaron par lagegaa, jo manyata praapt stock exange main listed hai
 Apart from this, there will also be a unit of equity related funds and business trust
 inkaa nahin kategaa tidisakar vibhaag ne yah bhi saaf kiya he ki resident tex peyar ko long turm capital gains se hone vaale bhugtan par kisi bhi tarah kaa tids nahin kaata jayega
 However, non-resident tax payers will have to pay tax at the rate of 10% on this payment
 isamen fahrren institutional invester (fiis) shaamil nahin honge

 Whenever there is talk of scoring the highest number of runs in an over, then firstly the figure of 36 runs comes in the mind of almost all cricket lovers
 vah bhi ravi shastri or gairi sobers dwaara kramash: tilak raaj or malcom naish ko ek over main maaraa gaya tha
 In 2007 T20, Yuvraj Singh also scored 36 runs in an over
 yuvaraj singh ne stuward broad ek over main chah chhakkon kii madad se yah karnama kiya tha
 But, the figures of first class cricket show that the number of runs scored by an over is not the name of these three bowlers

 The talk is in February 1990, the Shell Trophy was a Final Day match
 christchurch ke lancastor park main cantarbari ke khilaaf wellington kaa match tha
 Wellington had their last match of the season and they wanted to end the match with a win
 test match ke antin din kii subah wellington ne apni pari kii samaapti kii ghoshnaa kar di thi
 Canterbury needed 291 runs to win and had 59 overs
 ining kii shuruyaat main hi cantarbari ko jatke lage
 The innings was like a wobble
 haalat kuch aisi ho gai thi ki 196 ranon par aath wicket gir chuke the
 But Lee German and Roger Ford handled the innings and Wellington felt that the match was now going towards a draw
 kaha jaataa he ki german, jo team ke wicketiper the, zyada achche ballebaaj nahin the, striking and par the
 In such a situation, Morrison and wicketkeeper Captain Erv mcsweeney of Wellington came together to form a plan and the name of Burt Vance came up
 bart ne isse pehle kabhi gendbaaji nahin kii thi
 There was no bowling experience either
 ve apni team ke batsman the or unka kariyar samaapti kii ore tha
 It is said that the plan was to provoke the opposition team to score runs and in such a situation, the duo would be broken by taking wickets and to achieve the goal of victory
 aashcharya yah tha ki bart ne captain kii yojana kaa saath diya or gendbaaji karne ko taiyaar ho gaye
 It was also said that according to the plan, the opposition team should be given the chance to score runs so that they can get closer to the winning goal and lose the last two wickets in the desire to win and the match goes in favor of Wellington
 bart ko second last over diya gaya tha
 Then Canterbury needed 96 runs to win and the balls were just 12
 
 
 german is samay 75 naabad ran par khel rahe the
 The team had scored 196 runs and had taken eight wickets
 bart ne gendbaaji shuru kii
 Out of the first 17 balls that he threw, only the second was the right ball and the rest was no
 kai phultos ball bhi daaleen
 Morrison says that Burt did too much
 maamla yahi nahin tha, fielder bhi sust mod main aa gaye the or kai boundry gayi
 On the sixth ball, the German completed his century and this over total 77 runs
 isamen teen singles ke alaava aath chakke or chah chauke shaamil hai
 The German scored 70 runs in this over and Ford had scored five runs facing two balls
 is over main do genden no ball rahi jinamein ran nahin bane
 The special aspect of this entire scheme has been that the scorecard updateers and the scorecard writers were very upset
 kuch ek baar to yah hua ki unhen darshakon se poochkar scorcard apadet karnaa padaa
 Even the umpire had a hard time reading the balls and after the over was over when it was seen how many balls were bowled, the truth came to the fore and the umpires declared only five balls to be correct
 kaha jaataa he ki asamanjas kii sthiti kuch saamaanya hui jab antim over phenkane ke liye evan grey aae or tab tak cantarbari ko jeet ke liye 18 ranon kii jarurat thi or german ne pehali paanch gendon par 17 ran banaakar match barabari par laa diya
 This match was run drawn
 lekin scoreboard main kuch pataa nahin chal rahaa tha, scorer abhi bhi pareshaan chal rahe the
 There was so much confusion that umpire Ford stopped the match before the last ball of the match
 or sabhi khilaadi changing room main pahunch gaye
 The comments isliye kaha jaataa he ki captain kii yojanaayen kaamyaab bhi hoti hai or kabhi ulti bhi pad jaati hai
 
 
 Here it seemed that the plan brought losses on its own
 morrison kehete hai ki match ke kaaphi samay baad tak bahes hoti rahi
 But in the end we won the trophy
 is match main kuch genden or unpar gaye ran is prakaar rahe
 
 
 Bold balls were considered the right balls
 
 
 dekhen ball dal ball is over kii pragati We are talking about bowler Burt Vance
 baat farvari 1990 kii he, shell trophy kaa final de kaa match tha
 Wellington had a match against Canterbury at Lancaster Park in Christchurch
 wellington kaa us sijan kaa aakhri match tha or ve jeet ke saath match kaa ant karnaa chaahate the
 On the morning of the last day of the Test match, Wellington announced the end of their innings
 cantarbari ko jeet ke liye 291 ranon kii jarurat thi or uske paas 59 over the
 Canterbury suffered a setback at the start of the inning
 pari jaise ladkadaa gai thi
 The situation had become such that eight wickets had fallen for 196 runs
 lekin lee german or roger ford ne pari ko sambhala or wellington ko lagane laga ki match ab dra kii ore ja rahaa he
 It is said that the Germans, who were the wicketkeepers of the team, were not very good batsmen, at the striking end
 aise main wellington ke morrison or wicketiper captain erv mikasvine, ne milakar ek yojana banaai or bart vains kaa naam saamne aayaa
 Burt had never bowled before
 koi gendbaaji kaa anubhav bhi nahin tha
 He was the batsman of his team and was nearing completion
 kaha jaataa he ki yojana yah thi ki vipakshi team ko ran banane ke liye uksaaya jaae or aise main wicket lekar jami jodi ko todaa jaae or jeet kaa lakshya hasil kiya jaae
 The surprise was that Burt supported the captain's plan and agreed to bowl
 kaha yah bhi gaya ki yojana ke anusaar vipakshi team ko ran banane kaa mauka diya jaae taaki ve jeet ke lakshya ke kareeb pahunch saken or jeetne kii chahat main antim do wicket ganvaa den or match wellington ke paksh main chalaa jaae
 Burt was given the second last over
 tab cantarbari ko jeet ke liye 96 ranon kii jarurat thi or genden thi maatr 12
 
 
 The Germans were currently playing on 75 not out
 team ne 196 ran bana liye the or aath wicket ja chuke the
 Burt started bowling
 pehali 17 genden jo unhone phenki usamen se keval duusari hi sahi gend thi or baaki sab nobal raheen
 Also put several fulltos balls
 morrison kehete hai ki bart ne kuch zyada hi kar diya tha
 That was not the case, the fielders were also in slack mode and many went for boundaries
 chhathi gend par german ne apana shatak puraa kiya or is over kul 77 ran bane
 It includes eight sixes and six fours in addition to three singles
 german ne is over main 70 ran banaae or ford ne do gendon kaa saamana kar paanch ran banaae the
 Two balls in this over were no balls with no runs scored
 is puri yojana kaa khaas pahalu yah rahaa he ki scorcard apadet karne vaale or scorcard likhane vaale khub pareshaan hue
 It happened once that he had to update the scorecard by asking the audience
 yahaan tak ki empire ko gendon ko padhane main kaaphi dikkat hui or over khatm hone ke baad jab yah dekha gaya ki kitni genden phenki gai tab yah sach saamne aayaa or ampiron ne keval paanch gendon ko hi sahi qaraar diya
 The confusion was said to be somewhat normal when Evan Gray came in to throw the final over and by then Canterbury needed 18 runs to win and the Germans put the match on par with 17 runs off the first five balls
 ye match ran dra hua
 But there was nothing to be revealed in the scoreboard, with the scorers still running nervous
 itnaa asamanjas kaa maahaul ban gaya tha ki ampire ford ne match kii aakhri gend se pehle match ko roak diya
 And all the players reached the changing room
 tippaniyan Therefore, it is said that the captain's plans are successful and sometimes backfire
 
 
 yahaan aisa laga ki yojana apni ore hi nuksaan lekar ai
 Morrison says that the debate continued for a long time after the match
 lekin aakhir main hamane trophy jiti
 In this match some balls and runs scored on them were as follows
 
 
 bold genden hi sahi genden maani gayi
 
 
 See ball crew ball progress this over ining kii shuruyaat main hi cantarbari ko jatke lage

 Legislators will do what they say

 After this, Shiv Sena has asked all the mlas to stay in Mumbai

 amarnath yatra ke shuru hone main 21 din kaa samay bachaa he lihaaja surakshabal koi khatra mol nahin lenaa chaahate
 Therefore, we are busy in preparing our preparations
 vaise ab tak kaa itihaas rahaa he ki aatanki hamalon ko baavjood yatra main bhaag lane vaale ghabaraae nahin hai
 For the last nearly seven years, terrorists have been able to kill thousands of people targeting the Amarnath Yatra
 aisi bhi report he ki iesai rajya main hahaakar machaana chaahati he or vah kuch aisa anjaam dene kii koshishon main hai, jisase bharat kaa gussa or bhadke tathaa sabar kaa baandh tut jaae or iske liye amarnath yatra se acha koi avasar unhen nahin mil saktaa
 Officially, this time it has been said to allow more than five lakh people to join the yatra, so the earlier experience has been that the number of attendees crosses the figure of 4-5 lakh each time
 
 surakshabal koi khatra mol nahin lenaa chaahate the, isliye ek maah purv sabhi taiyaariyaan aarambh to kii gai thim parantu mausam kii gadabadiyon ne un par pani pher diya
 Consequently, the cleanliness of those areas, the landmines and the drive to free them from terrorists are in the middle
 sthiti yah he ki senadhikariyon ke rahasyodghatan ke baad yatriyon kii suraksha kaise hogi koi nahin jaanata he or sab bholanath par chhod diya gaya he
 The comments suraksha bal maanate he ki shanti kii bayaar ke baavjood amarnath yatra par is baar sabase adhik khatra mandara rahaa he
 However, it has now become a bitter reality that the terrorists are able to cause huge damage to the Amarnath Yatra every year by calling all security arrangements as Dhata
 natijatan is baar surakshadhikariyon kii chintaa doguni he
 The first reason is how security will be provided to the lakhs of pilgrims joining the 45 km long inaccessible and hilly trekking route, and the second reason is that the terrorists are trying to do something big to show their presence and spoil the atmosphere disturbed by the ceasefire
 
 2 july se shuru hone vaale yatra main surakshabal koi khatra mol nahin lenaa chaahate the, baavjood koi ye daawa nahin kar saktaa ki is baar aatankiyon ke napak mansoobey kaamyaab nahin honge, lihaaja sabakuch bholanath par chhod diya gaya he
 The main reason for this is that while terrorist activities have increased in Kashmir in recent times, different voices have been heard between the Hurriyat Conference and the terrorist groups
 suraksha balon ko ashanka he ki yatra ko nuksaan pahuchane ke liye aatanki gut bharsak koshish karenge
 There is 21 days left for the start of Amarnath Yatra, so the security forces do not want to take any risk
 isliye apni taiyaariyon ko durust karne main lage hai
 By the way, there has been a history that despite the terrorist attacks, those who participated in the yatra are not nervous
 pichley kareeb saat saalon se aatanki amarnath yatra ko nishaanaa bana bisiyon logon kii hatyaein karne main kaamyaab rahe hai
 There are also reports that the ISI wants to create a ruckus in the state and it is trying to do something that breaks India's anger and anger and patience and for this no good opportunity can be found from Amarnath Yatra
 sarkari taur par is baar paanch lakh se adhik logon ko yatra main shaamil hone kii anumati dene kii baat kahi gai he, to pehle kaa anubhav yahi rahaa he ki shaamil hone waalon kii sankhya 4-5 lakh ke aankade ko har baar paar kar jaati he
 The security forces did not want to take any risk, so all preparations were started a month ago, but weather disturbances turned them on
 natijatan un kshetron kii saaf safai, unhen barudi surangon tathaa aatankwaadiyon se mukt karwaane kaa abhiyaan adhabich main hi he
 The situation is that no one knows how the security of the passengers will be after the revelation of the army officers and all is left to Bholanath
 tippaniyan Security forces believe that despite the winds of peace, Amarnath Yatra is facing the most danger this time
 haalanki yah ab kadavi sachai ban gai he ki tamaam suraksha prabandhon ko datta bataate hue aatanki amarnath yatra ko har saal baari kshati pahunchane main kaamyaab rahete hai
 As a result, this time the security concerns of the security personnel have doubled
 pehali vajah ye he ki 45 kimi lambe durgam or pahari yatra maarg par shaamil hone vaale lakhon shraddhaluon ko suraksha kaise pradaan kii jaaegi to doosraa kaaran aatankwaadi apni maujuudagi ko dikhaane tathaa sijafire se pareshaan maahaul ko bigaadane kii khatir kuch bada kar dikhaane kii firaaq main hai
 In the yatra beginning on 2 July, the security forces did not want to take any risk, yet no one can claim that this time the nefarious plans of the terrorists will not succeed, so everything is left to Bholanath

 It is being told that farmers have taken petrol bottles and sulfas tablets in their hands

 Hundreds of farmers gathered outside the SDM office to support these farmer organizations

 During this time, the local administration also held several talks with the protesting farmers, but the farmers are adamant on their demand that they will not release the SDM and other government employees till they get the outstanding payment of sugarcane
 un logon ne esadm offis ke baahar taale laga die or dharne par baith gaye
 The farmers have to say that if any coercion was done by the government to remove them, then they will set themselves on fire by pouring petrol on them and give their lives by eating bullets of sulfas

 Coast Guard ships are keeping an eye on the waterways every moment, the airfighters are constantly petrol
 in tamaam taiyaariyon ke bich washington main trephic ko divert karnaa shuru kar diya gaya he, kyonki jis vakt obama kaa kafila sadakon par nikalegaa, usee vakt puraa washington jaise thahar jayega, tamaam pulon ko band kar diya jayega, downtaun main bhi paabandiyaan laga di jaaengi
 Cameras have been installed everywhere, the FBI will keep a close watch on the control room
 lekin suraksha kii in taiyaariyon ke bich obama kya kar rahe hai
 After going to the White House, they will never be able to roam freely, that is why they are fulfilling their desire right now

 Everyone is waiting for the time when Obama will take oath by placing his hand on Lincoln's Bible and become Mr
 President
 washington apane nae raashtrapati kaa swaagat karne ke liye taiyaar he
 The two-eleven-year-old band detachment of the US Navy has rehearsed and is now waiting for the time when US President Barack Obama will take oath
 baraak obama ke shapath grahan ke liye minute dar minute kaa kaarykram tay ho chukaa he
 On January 20, when the ten of the day are played in America, the Navy band will start playing the tune
 is dhun par san francisco ke ladke or ladakiyon kii toli geet gaaegi
 At exactly eleven o'clock Obama and his family will reach the stage

 Five thousand people are arranged to watch the parade and a $ 25 ticket was sold out in just one minute
 ab jo log parade ko najadik se nahin dekh paaenge, wo obama ko shapath lete dekhne kaa mauka chuknaa nahin chaahate
 How desperate the people are in this desire, it has been estimated from the concert
 washington police kaa andaaza he ki shapath grahan dekhne ke liye america or duniya ke duusare deshon se kareeb chalis lakh log washington kii raah pakad chuke hai
 George Bush is yet to be formally called off from Washington
 phir bhi chaaron taraf sirf ek hi rang chadha hua he obama kaa rang
 How will this historic ceremony of swearing go on in Washington? shapath grahan ke liye baraak obama sidhe capital building nahin jaaenge, balki wo blair house se niklenge or saint jon carch pahunchenge
 After this, Obama will attend prayer in the church

 After leaving the church, Obama will leave the church and leave for the White House

 This will be the historic moment when America's first black president will enter the White House
 white house main jorge bush unka swaagat karenge, or donon saath baithkar kuch der gapshap karenge
 Bush and Obama will then leave the White House for the Capitol Building
 iske baad shuru hoga udghaatan samaaroh, agle pandrah se bees minute tak tamaam netaa manch par bolenge, or bees minute ke baad america ke chif justise roberts nae raashtrapati obama ko shapath dilaayenge
 After the oath, America's first black president will address the world, and it will also reflect in the coming world
 zyada lanbaa nahin chalane vaala he obama kaa ye aitihaasik bhaashan
 After that, Bush will leave by helicopter, but the song music program will start again, the Capitol Building will resonate with the music in honor of Obama
 obama ke bare main ab to duniya bahut kuch jaan chuki he, lekin unki nijee jindagi ke bare main duniya bahut kam jaanati he
 For example, what are Obama's hobbies, food, clothing, studies and sports, what does the new President of America like, let's take a look at some untouched aspects of Obama's life
 baraak hossain obama, is shaks ke bare main jaanane se pehle is naam kaa matlab samajhie, baraak yani wo jise uuparavaale kaa aashirwad hasil he, or aaj jis mukaam par obama pahunch chuke hai, usase bhi ye to jaahir hota hi he
 By the way, his secret service has given him the code name Renegade which means a tramp, a fugitive or a religionist
 ab jo bhi aap samaj len
 By the way, they have faith in the above, that is why they always keep a small idol of Bajrang Bali and a bracelet in their pockets
 obama ko spiderman kaa kirdaar or canan da barbarian comics bahut pasand he
 He has read every book of Harry Potter series well
 vaise padhane likhane kaa shauk to unhen hameshaa se rahaa he, chaar saal pehle hi unhone ek kitaab likhane kii deal sin kii
 It is also interesting that Obama paid the loan for his studies with the money he received from that deal
 baayen haath ke khilaadi obama ko mukkebaaji main bhi majaa aata he
 That is why he also has two red gloves with Muhammad Ali's autograph and he was a hero in the basketball ball, so he was called o Bamber instead of Obama in the field
 is khel ke to wo itane diwane hai ki white house ke maidan main wo apane liye basket ball court tak banavaane kii taiyaari main hai
 By the way, he also has a lot of time in indoor games like Scrabble and Poker
 apni javaani ke dinon main baraak ne iscream kii dukaan main kaam kiya he, lekin unka pasandida snacks hai- chocolate pint protein bars
 In the case of nonways, he is far ahead
 indonesia main apane bachapan ke dinon main wo saanp kaa meet or tandoori tidde tak khate the
 In Indonesia itself, Barak also had a pet monkey named Tata
 chaliye chhodie, ye sab puraani bate hai
 Today, the responsibilities on Obama are more, that is why a lot of his time is spent on Blackbury phone, that's why Obama considers it his worst habit
 raashtrapati banane ke liye jab wo campan shuru kar rahe the, tab unhone apni bivi mishael se vaada kiya tha, ki wo jald cigarette chhod denge, lekin ab tak to unhone apana vaada nibhaayaa nahin
 But all hope that in their speeches, they should definitely fulfill the promise they are making to the world
 america me obama ke shapath kii jo bhi taiyaariyaan hai, bharat main bhi kuch tabake puure josh main he
 Although the experts say that Obama's arrival is good news for India, but what should school children know about all this
 wo to khush hai america raashtrapati kaa cheharaa apane chehre par lagaae
 Yes, some school children murdered by Obama in Lucknow marched on the streets, that too with Obama's mask
 vahiin obama kii tajposhi se pehle unke kuch shubhachintakon ne bakayada unke liye sundar cond kaa paath kiya
 Although school children are seeing Obama as a strong politician against terror, but terrorism spreading in their country is also a big issue for them

 supreme court ne vivipat kii parchiyon ke satyaapan yani vivipat paper trail ke physical veriphication maamle par halafanama daakhil karne ke liye chunaav ayog ko shuukravaar tak kaa samay de diya he
 The top court extended this time on the appeal of the Election Commission
 isse pehle sheersh adaalat ne chunaav ayog ko is babat 28 march ko shaam chaar baje tak halafanama daakhil karne kaa nirdesh diya tha
 On Monday, the Supreme Court insisted on increasing the process of verification of VVPAT slips in the Lok Sabha elections and assembly elections, asking the Election Commission that no institution should keep itself separate from the reforms
 chif justise ranjan gogoi or justise deepak gupta kii peeth ne vipakshi dalon kii yachika par sunwaayee ke dauraan chunaav ayog ko yah bataane kaa nirdesh diya tha ki kya vah loksabhaa chunaav or vidhansabha chunaav ke liye har kshetra main vivipat ke ek-ek namoona surveykshan kii jagah yah sankhya badha saktaa he?iske saath hi court ne yah poocha tha ki chunaav ayog yah bhi bataae ki kya namoona surveykshan ko ek hai level par badhaayaa ja he? ye yachika andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu ke netritv main 21 vipakshi dalon ke netaaon ne daakhil kii he
 In this, the apex court has been demanded to direct the random investigation of slips of at least 50 per cent vvpats in each constituency in the Lok Sabha elections and assembly elections
 sheersh adaalat kii peeth ne kaha tha ki yah aarope lagane kaa sawaal nahin he, balki yah votaron kii santushti kaa maamla he
 Now the Election Commission will have to file its reply in the Supreme Court by Friday
 iske baad vipakshi dalon ke netaaon kii is yachika par ek april ko aage kii sunwaayee hogi
 As soon as the case began hearing on Monday, the court questioned Deputy Election Commissioner Sudeep Jain whether the commission could increase the number of verifications of VVPAT slips
 philhal chunaav ayog ne prayek vidhansabha kshetra ke sirf ek matdaan kendra main vivipat kii parchiyon ke satyaapan kii vyavastha kii he
 Jain's reply to this was that the Election Commission had enough reason to believe that the current system of verification of VVPAT slips need not be changed
 peeth ne is par jain se kaha tha ki yah voter kii santushti kaa sawaal he
 There is no question of accusation in this
 aap hamen bataaen ki kya aap inaki sankhya badha sakate hai? agar aap aisa kar sakate hai, to kiijie, varanaa hamako isaki vajah bataaie
 Let us tell you that the Supreme Court had issued a notice to the Election Commission on 15 March regarding the matter and directed to appoint a competent officer to help in this matter
 yachika daayar karne waalon main 6 rashtriya or 15 kshetreey dalon ke netaaon kaa daawa he ki wo desh kii 70 se 75 fisadi jansankhya kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 These parties include Congress, NCP, Aam Aadmi Party, CPI (M), Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Rashtriya Lok Dal, Loktantrik Janata Dal and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam
 in dalon ne farvari main chunaav ayog ke saath baithak main bhi iviem kii vishwasaneeyata ko lekar ashankaayen vyakt kii thim, lekin ayog ne in mashiinon ke saath kisi prakaar kii chhedchhad ke aaropon se inkaar kar diya tha
 The Commission then announced the dates of the Lok Sabha elections, saying that evms and VVPAT machines would be compulsorily examined on the basis of one assembly constituency in each Lok Sabha constituency

 - # prasoonjoshi | # childsafety After a legal battle between Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat for nearly two decades, the path was cleared to bring Babbar lions from Gir to Kuno Palpur sanctuary
 lekin turant hi duusare sawaal uth khadey hue hai
 Especially the case of protection of lions
 rajasthan ke ranthambhore se aane vaale baaghon ne bhi vanya praani visheshgyon kii chintaa badhaai he kyonki isse sher or baagh main takaraav kii naubat paidaa ho sakati he
 Kuno Palpur Sanctuary lies in Sheopur, a border district of Madhya Pradesh
 rajasthan ke ranthambhore vaale savai madhopur jile or iske bich bas chambal nadi kaa faasla he
 Kuno has a buffer area of 900 sq km and a core area of 344 km
 iske rest house par ek bada hording laga he, jis par sheron ke chitra ke saath angreji main likhaa he ''still vatting for new bigining'' yani ek nai shuruyaat kaa ab bhi he intjaar
 There is still a few months left to get a real picture of the lions here, but the challenge has started on the challenges
 madhya pradesh ke baagh abhayaarany or sangrakshit van ilaakon main shikari bade paimaane par sakriy rahe hai
 Last year, 13 tigers died in the state
 haalanki van vibhaag maanata he ki shikaar inamen se teen kaa hi hua he bakibaagh beemaari, durghatana or aapasi ladaai main maare gaye
 Security is still a big concern as the Kuno Palpur Sanctuary is not hidden from the eyes of poachers
 pichley saal june main dehradun sthit vanyajeev santhaan ke visheshgy jab kuno main tenduon kii ginati kar rahe the, to unke chah camere chori ho gaye the, jo ab tak nahin mili
 In the opinion of experts, the predator network does not want to let the actual number of leopards come out
 kuno-palpur se lage jangalon main pichley maah hi do shikariyon ko chinkaara or duusare vanya praaniyon ke maance ke saath pakadaa gaya tha
 In the last one year only half a dozen cases of poaching have been reported in and around the sanctuary
 udhar ranthambhore ke teen baagh pichley do varshon se madhya pradesh kii seemaa main hai
 Apart from this, a small tiger (about two and a half years old) came here from Ranthambore last month and is currently roaming in the forests of Sevdha in Datia district near Gwalior
 baaghon kii yah swaabhaavik awajahi he, lekin ranthambhore ke field afasar vaai
 K
 sahu kii raay main, babbar sheron ke duusare ghar kuno palpur main ''agar baagh bhi aakar rahane lage to takaraav sambhav he
 Reason: Lions and tigers have the same food
 ek hi kshetra or bhojan iskaa mukhya kaaran he
 "fayaz Khudsar, who researches on the Kuno Palpur Sanctuary, believes that the security arrangements here are good but they need to be done very well
" ''ek jangal main sheron ke saath ek-do baaghon kaa rahanaa zyada gambhir samasya nahin he
 No such research has come to the fore yet to prove this
 kareeb ek sadi pehle madhya bharat ke jangalon main sheron ke rahane ke pramaan mili hai, isliye zyada chintaa karne kii jarurat nahin
 The state government is also excited about the arrival of the lions
 van mantri sartaaj singh kehete hai, ''kuno palpur abhayaarany ko singhon ke liye acchhee tarah taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Security system will also be complete
 yahaan suraksha staff sankhya main kam he par koi samasya ai to uskaa adhyayan kar puure prabandh kiye jaaenge
 "additional Chief Conservator of Forests (wildlife) Suhas Kumar talks about the preparations here," it was decided to bring cheetah from Africa in Kuno
 ab singhon ko laane se pehle har pahalu se use durust karenge
 "however, there is still time to hear the roar of the lion in the Kuno Sanctuary
" iske pehle kai prabhavi kadam uthaae jane hai
 First, it has to be kept away from the eyes of the poachers
 gir se aane vaale sheron par bhi lagaataar nigaraanee rakhni hogi
 a failed example is in front
 1957 main uttar pradesh ke chandraprabha abhayaarany main teen sheron ko rakhaa gaya tha par ve aasapaas ke gaanvon ke maweshiyon ko hi maarane lage, jisase unhen maarna padaa
 a strategy has to be made keeping in mind all aspects
 isamen ghaas ke maidaanon or pani kaa uchit prabandhan bhi shaamil he kyonki yah asian sheron ke alaava duusare praaniyon kii bhi jivan rekha he

 iske saath hi unhone chetavanee di ki ‘jo log saanp paal rahe hai, unhen uskaa dansh bhi jhelana hoga

 grahamantri kii ore se pakistan par hamalaa bole jane ke ek hi din pehle pradhanmantri modi ne use ‘aatankwaad kaa poshan karne vaali bhoomi’ qaraar diya tha
 Addressing a two-day conference of regional editors of the North and Northeast states, Rajnath said, "the entire power establishment of Pakistan is engaged in promoting terrorism in India and that is why the management of the areas along the indo-pak border is a Has become a challenging task
 lekin jo log saanp paalate hai, unhen yah pataa hona chahie ki ve (saanp) unhen bhi dasenge

 donon apane hi ghar main waapas aa gaye
 What did the ox and dog do? The name of the Brahmin's son was Sumati, he was also a scholar of the Vedas
 He kept the bull and the dog in his house
 Once Sumati paid obeisance to the parents, made kheer for the food of the Brahmins, in the kheer a snake fell and the Kheer became poisonous
 The Brahmin became a dog, he saw all this, he touched the Kheer in front of Sumati's wife to save Sumati from this, on this, Sumati's letter Nee Nebina understood, beating the dog with burning wood and did not even feed him
 After the dog told the truth to the Brahmin who was the bull, his son Sumati listened to everything and understood that this bull and dog was actually his mother
 -the father is the second born as an animal
