 After the temple collapsed from the flood, a small door was made in the northeast by removing the frame stones from different rooms

 Mangal Singh Champia, India's only male archer who competed in the Beijing Olympics, may have missed a medal four years ago, but believes that the Indian archers at the London Olympics will not disappoint
 champia kadi mehnat ke baavjood landan olympic ke liye kwalifai nahin kar paye lekin unka kahana he ki ubhartee teerandaaj deepika kumari is samay puure form main hai or puri sambhaavna he ki deepika kii badaulat mahila varg main bharat koi na koi tamgaa jarur hasil karegaa
 However, he said that the team of well-matched Indian male archers Jayant Talukdar, Rahul Banerjee and Tarundeep Rai cannot be underestimated and has worked hard to qualify for the London Olympics
 jamshedpur ke arjuna puraskaar vijeta champia ne kaha, ‘puri ummid he ki landan olympic main (teerandaji kii spardhaon main) koi na koi padak aayega kyonki sabhi khilaadi acchhee form main hai
 The girls had won a silver medal at the World Championships and it is likely that they will also perform well in the Olympics
 ’ Four years ago in 2014, just before the Lok Sabha elections in Serampore in West Bengal, the words of Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi were in a public meeting, "after May 16, these Bangladeshis will have to leave with a bag
 
 
 ''padosi rajya assam main unke in shabdon kaa bahut zyada asar hua tha
 The state, which has been battling the problem of illegal migrants for nearly half a century, gave BJP 7 out of 14 seats in the Lok Sabha due to the effect of these words
 do saal baad rajya ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bhaajapa ne maati, beti or jati kii raksha karne kaa naaraa diya or pehali baar party baari jeet ke saath assam main satta main aa gai
 But it seems, everything is changing now: the Prime Minister and his party are facing huge public outcry for their alleged 'conspiracy to rehabilitate' the same Bangladeshi migrants in the Brahmaputra Valley, whom they promised to flee from the state Was
 maamla itnaa bad gaya he ki mukhyamantri sarbanand sonoval ne istipha dene kii dhamkee de di he

 The Bill removed the citizenship law of 1955 and replaced it with the granting of Indian citizenship to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian immigrants who immigrated to India before December 31, 2014 after being harassed by religious persecution in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan
 It has been said
 pichley do varshon main asamiya-bhashi jansankhya iskaa baari virodh kar rahi he
 These people fear that this law will help illegal Hindu migrants from Bangladesh to settle permanently in Assam by taking Indian citizenship
 bahuton ko dar he ki iske kaaran bangla-bhashi logon kii sankhya asamiya bolne waalon se zyada ho jaaegi
 The threat of resignation from Sonowal came at a time when a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) headed by BJP MP Rajendra Aggarwal was going to hold a public hearing on the bill

 In Guwahati, the bjp's ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) first gave a memorandum in protest against this amendment
 pravaasiyon ke virodh main chaatro ke andolan se upji agap kaa kahana tha ki is vidheyak se centre or andolan ke netaaon ke bich hua 1985 kaa samjhauta radd ho jayega

 yah ek aisa kaam he jisamen 25 march, 1971—samjhaute main tay kii gai antim taarikh—ke baad avaidh rup se rajya main pravesh karne waalon kaa pataa lagaaya jayega
 The new bill has changed this last date to 31 December 2014 for those migrants who are Hindus
 jepisi ke ek sadsy kehete hai, ''maujuuda virodh ke baad mujhe nahin lagata ki centre is vidheyak ko paarit karnaa chahega
 It will undoubtedly be challenged in court
 '' ve kehete hai ki avaidh pravasi dharm ke aadhaar par naagarikta ke hakdaar hote ja rahe hai or ve samvidhan ke anuchhed 14 kaa bhi ulanghan kar sakate hai jo samanta ke adhikaar kii guarantee detaa he
 Former Congress chief minister Tarun Gogoi has also condemned the bill, although many leaders of his party have openly supported the bill from the Barak Valley — where Hindu Bengalis have more population
 bhaajapa ke andruni logon kaa kahana he ki alaakaman is vidheyak ko puri takat se paarit karnaa chahta tha kyonki use dar tha ki taaja enarasi main bangladeshi hindu pravaasiyon kii badi sankhya baahar ho jaaegi or isse pashchim bengal main party kii sambhaavnaaon par vipareet prabhaav pad saktaa he
 The RSS has also strongly advocated giving concessions to Hindus
 lekin guwahati main jepisi kii jan sunwaayee ke dauraan logon kii naaraazgi ko dekhte hue party ko is par dobaaraa vichaar karnaa pad rahaa he
 Assam Finance Minister Hemant Biswa Sarma, who has long been in favor of the amendment, now says that the state is awaiting fresh NRC

 Salman Khan's 'bharat' was long awaited, and Salman Khan will be seen in many ways in this film
 salmaan khan 'bharat' main kai andaaj main najar aa rahe hai
 Salman Khan is sometimes seen in the Navy and sometimes working in a coal mine
 yahi nahin, salmaan khan sarkas main bhi kaam karte najar aa rahe hai
 After seeing the teaser of 'bharat', the same thing comes in mind that this film too is going to be completely Salman Khan style
 'bharat (bharat)' ko ali abbaas jafar ne diarect kiya he or salmaan khan ke saath katrina caff (katrina Kaif) bhi najar aaengi
 The teaser of 'bharat Teaser' is being liked by everyone
 salmaan khan kii film 'bharat (bharat Teaser)' kaa tiger dekhne ke baad graphics kaa locha bhi thodaa najar aata he kyonki sarkas vaale shot main salmaan khan thodaa ajeeb dikhte hai or wo puraa seen hi thodaa ajeeb lagata he

 online aavedan karne kii aakhri taarikh-30 janvari 2018 Bollywood has called the incident of detention of film star Shah Rukh Khan at Newark Airport in the US for shocking, indecisive and insane
 shahrukh ko sambhavat: unke upnaam kii vajah se hi poochtacha ke liye roka gaya
 Star actor Irrfan Khan, who played an important role in the film Billu with Maloom Shahrukh, does not matter for the common and special, reacting to the incident and said, "america's condition is that of a Paranoid (a person suffering from persecution) It does not make a difference who is the common man and who is the President or film star of any country
 unki suraksha jaanch pranali paranaid he
 "he said that the American security system works like a machine and cannot differentiate between suspicious people and famous people
" vah apana bhi samay barbaad karti he or logon ko bhi apamaanit karti he
 Criticized by well-known filmmakers, Irfan said that instead of hurting people, America should fix its security system and the government should also give a strong message on its part that such behavior is unpredictable
 shahrukh khan ke dost karan johar, farha khan, juhi chawla or ajij mirza tathaa mahesh bhatta or raja muraad jaisi film jagat kii varisht hastiyon ne america ko uske vyavhaar ke liye bhartsana kii he
 All shocked and saddened by the incident, Johar said that he is astonished and sad and upset about thinking about Shah Rukh, while Juhi Chawla said that stopping Shah Rukh is as absurd as searching for Brad Pitt when he comes to India Be taken, questioned and investigated
 agar life ho jaae out of control to kya karenge? pyaar kii bhashaa main shabdon kii kami pad jaae to kya karenge? tanaav or khinchataan bhari jindagi main udaasi chaa jaae to kya karenge?pyaar or sambandhon main khushlahi aapasi rishton kii choti-choti baton par nirbhar karti he
 There are some small things that can be doubled if taken into consideration: 1
 boring jindagi main uljhe aapasi sambandhon main agar rang bharna chaahate hai to saamaanya routine main thodaa sa vakt nikaalen or apni jeevanasathi kii yaadgaar tasviren khinchakar unhen sarprise kar den
 Make them feel that you still admire their beauty and they are equally special for you today
 2
 If your sex life is going to be affected badly by everyday boring routine, then do something special on this weekend
 kisi shandaar resort main jane kaa bajet na ho to apane ghar ko hi romani andaaj den
 If possible, take a shower with each other
 ek-duusare ke bilkul kareeb aane se pehle tan-man kii tarotaazgi bad jaaegi
 3
 har weekend par ek jaisaa routine, to kyon na is baar kuch alag karen
 You take up their responsibilities and that is yours
 nahin samajhe, matlab kyon na is baar unka kichan sambhaal aap sambhalakar unhen chaunkaa den or aapaki jagah hafte bhar ke bill or jaruri kagajaton ko vah sahejkar rakh den
 4
 is baar unhen apane doston se anokhe andaaj main milaayein
 If you make various excuses from your friends to meet your boyfriend every weekend, then this is the right time to surprise your friends
 ek single party rakhen or apane bwoyfriend ko apane best friend se milakar sarprise kar den
 This will also increase trust in your mutual relationship
 5
 Everyone goes to see romantic pictures with girlfriends, why not make your date memorable with a horror film
 kisi horer seen main darkar jab vah aapke kandhe main apana munh chipa lengi to yakeenan date kaa majaa doguna ho jayega
 6
 pyaar main hameshaa nayaapan barkaraar rakhane ke liye aap kai gatividhiyon main ek-duusare kaa saath de sakate hai
 For example, a Salsa class or a Spanish or German language class
 isamen ek-duusare ke saath aapako samay bitaane kaa to mauka milegaa hi or ek shagal bhi isi bahaane puraa ho jayega
 7
 pyaar main romaaniat bhari kitni hi fantasy aksar aapke man main aati hongi
 Instead of hiding them, keep it in front of your spouse and try something new in some romance
 sex life ko khushnuma rakhane or romance ko barkaraar rakhane kaa isse aasaan tarika bhala kya hoga
 8
 rishton main har samay barasata pyaar kahin bojhil na lage isliye kyon na kabhi-kabhi choti-si baat par nokajhonk ho jaae
 Small love in love further strengthens the relationship
 9
 Refresh yourself for a fresh start and get ready to turn the stagnation in your relationship into a thrill
 jindagi main rang bharne kaa isse acha mauka bhala kya hoga
 She has arrived and words fall short to express our happiness
 Thank you for all your wishes

 ab khabaron kii maane to unhen bollywood kii ek leading ladi ke saath ek or film mil gai he
 According to reports, Sumit has got the film with Kangana Ranaut
 ise 'bareli ke barfi' fame ashvini ayyar bana rahe hai
 It will be a sports drama film based on the annual national kabaddi competition
 charchaa he ki kangana film ke liye 15 din kaa workshop bhi karengi, jisamen wo kabddi ke muves seekhengi
 'veere Di Wedding' is considered lucky, the film's hero Sumit vyasdna has quoted sources as saying that Sumit has been approached for the role of a kabaddi player
 wo is saal oktober se film kii shooting shuru kar sakate hai
 Review: Youngsters will like Veere The Wedding, excellent casting uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main teen talaak ke mudde ko lekar muslim mahilaon kaa samarthan milane kaa daawa kar chuki bijepi ko ab ummid he ki dilli nagar nigam ke chunaav main bhi isi mudde par use muslim samaaj kii mahilaon kaa saath milegaa
 The bjp's Delhi unit also says that it will not use the issue of triple talaq for electoral gains, though it feels that the party's stand on the matter will naturally lead to Muslim women
 dilli bijepi alpsankhyak morcha ke adhyaksh aatif rashid ne kaha ki bijepi ne teen talaak ke mudde ko chunavi phaayde ke makasad se nahin uthaaya he
 The party has already made it clear that it is an issue related to the rights of women and it is following this stand
 unhone kaha ki jab aap kisi mudde par kaam karte hai to uskaa inaam bhi miltaa he
 In such a situation, it can be expected that like Uttar Pradesh, the party will get the support of Muslim women in Delhi
 mahilaon ko yah mahasoos ho rahaa he ki bijepi iklauti aisi party he jo unke haq kii baat kar rahi he
 This is the reason why Muslim women gave their support to the BJP in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections
 teen talaak ke mudde par aam aadmi party or congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue rashid ne kaha ki congress or kejariwal teen talaak ke mudde par kuch nahin bol rahe hai
 For the sake of votebank, they are cutting back on the issue of women's rights
 ye log sargical stril par sawaal khadey kar dete hai, lekin is samvedansheel mudde par nahin bolte
 In the context of BJP launching seven Muslim candidates in the MCD election, Atif Rashid said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the bjp's mantra is 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'
 isi moolmantra ko lekar party aage bad rahi he
 Rashid said that Kejriwal government has completely ignored Okhla, Mustafabad and other Muslim majority settlements
 in ilaakon main siver line nahin bichaai gai or sadakon kii haalat bhi khasta he
 Not only this, mismanagement happened in the Waqf Board during AAP and that is why the Lieutenant Governor had to take the step of dissolving the board

 aise main yah ummid kii ja sakati he ki uttar pradesh kii tarah dilli main bhi muslim mahilaon kaa samarthan party ko milegaa
 Women feel that BJP is the only party that is talking about their rights
 yahi vajah he ki uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main muslim mahilaon ne bijepi ko apana samarthan diya
 Targeting the Aam Aadmi Party and Congress on the issue of triple talaq, Rashid said that Congress and Kejriwal are not speaking anything on the issue of triple talaq
 votbank kii khatir ve mahila adhikaar ke mudde par munh kholane se kanni kaat rahe hai
 These people raise questions on the surgical style, but do not speak on this sensitive issue

 The factor (which increases the vote share of AAP) that has shocked BJP, has given wings to the hope of the desperate Aam Aadmi Party from its performance at the national level in the Lok Sabha elections

 BJP state president Harsh Vardhan says, "such drama will not help

 "while AAP leader and former minister Manish Sisodia argues," It is a matter of principle, not of money

 ” haalanki unka maananaa he ki court is maamle ko apwaad maan sakati thi, lekin kejariwal kaa aacharan aisa nahin laga ki unke maamle ko apwaad ke bataur liya ja sake

 Says Bhambri, "AAP took some childish measures and instead of taking the steps slowly, the party, which came into existence a year ago, fielded candidates for 425 Lok Sabha seats
 phir sabakuch chhodkar puri party varanasi pahunch gai
 "bhambri believes," You have lost, but he has got votes
 isliye aisa kahana ki party khatm ho rahi he yaa use khaarij karnaa sahi nahin hoga
 In politics, parties are formed for a long time and have their own rules
 lekin ye ajeeb log hai, jinhone haar kaa vishleshan kiye bina nateezon ke 4-5 din ke bheetar hi sadakon par utarane kaa faisla kar liya

 Kejriwal's heart has increased by Delhi itself
" unhone pehle apane hi vidhayakon ke dabaav main uparajyapal ko vidhansabha na bhang karne kii chitthee saunp di or phir se sarkaar banane ke vikalp dhundne lage
 But failing, he turned around within 24 hours and said that there is no possibility of forming a government, so AAP will contest for the election

 In the Lok Sabha, the victory of only 4 seats in Punjab in the entire country is considered by AAP leaders to be the result of public anger against the Akali government surrounded by allegations of corruption and nepotism

 First aid was given to the injured
 vahiin train ke yatriyon ne achaanak brake lagane kaa virodh kiya
 The Delhi Sarai Rohilla Kalka Himalayan Queen Express is an express train in the Northern Railway zone that connects Chandigarh to New Delhi
 pataa nahin wo koun sa julm he, jisane asaram ke din kaa chaiyn or raaton kii neend haraam kar di he
 Sitting on the velvet Vyasgaddi, preaching Asaram is ravaging the rough ground of the jail or his illness, which no one knows except him
 khud asaram ke bete narayan sai bhi nahin
 Asaram had pleaded with the court a few days before that he had a serious illness, which only one of his women, Vaidya Nita, could treat
 is maamle main nita ko adaalat ne buudhvaar ko bulaayaa lekin ab uski sunwaayee guuruuvaar ko hogi lekin peshey se vaidya or asaram ke puraane raajadaar or hamsaaya amrit prajapati ne jo khulaasa kiya he, usase aapke pairon tale jameen khisak jaaegi
 Amrit Prajapati was once a blind devotee of Asaram, but one day when he saw Asaram celebrating with a girl in his meditation hall, he opened his eyes
 iske baad bhi prajapati ne alag-alag vakt par alag-alag ladakiyon ke saath asaram ko kai baar aapattinajak haalat main dekha or akhirkaar unhone asaram se duuri bananaa hi thik samajha
 According to Prajapati, Asaram often asked for sex-enhancing drugs like Kamini Mardan, Ashwagandha, Shilajit, Makardhwaja Ras and Asaram also consumed opium
 ratlam se kareeb 17 kilometre dur asaram ke panched ashram main wo khud afim kii kheti karavaate or vahaan se hameshaa apane liye afim kii khep mangavate lekin duniyaavaalon kii najaron se bachane ke liye asaram ne opium ke liye ek nayaa cord verde panched booti tay kar rakhaa tha
 So whether Asaram has opium addiction, the court will decide it but Prajapati, who worked in Asaram's ashram from 1989 to 2005, even says that Asaram would not only use sexual enhancement drugs, but the girls he used to Increasingly, they were also fed such medicines and these drugs were often mixed with milk in the girls
 vaise gaur karanevaali baat yah he ki jis ladki ne asaram ke khilaaf police main shikaayat darj karwaai, us ladki se bhi kathith taur par jyaadati karne se pehle asaram ne use doodh pine ko diya tha
 The statement given to the police under Section 161 of the IPC of the victim girl who accused Asaram of sexual exploitation, is extremely sensational
 peedit ladki ne apane bayaan main kaha he ki 6 agast ko main thodi biimaar mahasoos kar rahi thi to chhindwara ashram kii warden shilpi ne mujhase kaha ki tum par bhoot-pret kaa saaya he
 Only Bapu can fix this
 ladki apane bayaan main aage kahati he ki usee raat ek ladki ko mere saamne bithaaya gaya
 The whole night i was awakened and ritualized and told to become a sadhvi
 agle din yani 7 agast ko ladki ko ashram ke pramukh sharat ke saamne pesh kiya gaya
 Sharat gave his phone to the girl and said that call your brother and tell him that your health is very bad
 aisa sunanaa tha ki 8 agast ko ladki ke mata-pita chhindwara ashram pahunch gaye
 From where he was taken to Jodhpur on 14 August
 ladki apane bayaan main aage kahati he ki ashram main kareeb 100 log baithe the
 On seeing me, Bapu said that you are the girl with the ghost
 aao, main tumhaara bhoot utaarata hum
 They asked me what do you want to be
 maine kaha ki sie
 His answer to this was what would you do as a CA
 bade-bade adhikari to yahaan mere kadamon main pade rahete hai
 The victim girl says that on August 15, Asaram was talked to during the day, but at around 10 pm, the owner of the farm house came and said that Asaram was calling
 ladki apane maa-baap ke saath farm house pahunchi jahaan uske maa-baap ko saamne bitha diya gaya or ladki ko peeche ke chabutare par
 The girl gave a statement to the police that Bapu went inside the back door and beckoned me
 ilaaj ke liye mujhe palang par bithaaya or koi jal chhidaka
 Then said that if you are intelligent in reading and writing, then become a sadhvi
 pravachan karo or mere saath raho
 After this, the front door closed from inside
 andar main akeli thi
 Whatever accusations the girl has made after that, it is well known
 bihar ke gaya main satta ke nashe main chur ek siyaasi parivaar ke bigadel bete ne ek parivaar kaa iklauta charaag buja diya, lekin ab to is andhergardi main insaaf kii ummiido kaa charaag bhi bujhataa dikhaai de rahaa he
 In every plea of aditya's mother, the pain of killing the son is clear, but at the same time, there is a fear that the police are trying to save their son's killer
 The murder accused Rocky Yadav and his family of saving the police
 purv ipies afasar kishor kunal ne is cese main gaya police police kii nimnlikhit khamiyaan bataai hai, jo sidhe sawaal khadey karti hai
 1- There is significant evidence in the case of killing blood of the deceased Aditya
 lekin ye kapade aspataal ke postmortem house ke baahar phenke mili
 In such a situation, the question arises that why the blood-soaked clothes of Aditya were not recovered? 2- The pistol of the murderer from which the bullet was fired, was touched casually by a policeman with open arms
 aakhir katl main istemaal pistaul ko nange haathon se kyon chuaa gaya?3- aaropee hatyare rocky ko giraftaar karke police ne apni peeth to thapthapai, lekin usase poochtacha ke liye usne adaalat se remand kii maang kyon nahin kii?4- police ne manorama devi ko bhaagane kaa mauka kyon de diya
 Why did the police not arrest him even when a large amount of illicit liquor was recovered from his house? 5- Why was the FIR not lodged by Aditya's three friends in his shift car during the murder? After 54 hours of the incident, the police claimed that they arrested Rocky out of Gaya
 jabaki uske ghar se mahaj 15 kimi
 Why was not searched at any of his factory or office located far away
 sambhaavna he ki ghatana ke vakt rocky ne sharaab pi hogi
 Did the police deliberately give him time so that it could not be proved in the medical test? 7- Rocky's father Bindi Yadav told the police that his son was shot in self-defense
 jabaki uski maa manorama devi isse saaf inkaar karte hue kaha tha ki vah nahin jaanati ki rocky kahaan he? kya police ko manorama devi ko gumraah karne ke aarope main giraftaar nahin karnaa chahie tha?8- police giraft main aane ke baad rocky ne kaha tha ki vahvaardaatke vakt dilli main tha
 She surrenders at the behest of her mother
 police ne rocky kii baat kii pushti ke liye uske tikat yaa dilli ke thikaane kii talaashi kyon nahin lee?9- mauka-e-vaardaat par maujuud bodyguard rakesh kumaar se police ne poochtacha kyon nahin kii? usase itani jaldi jail bhejne kii kya jarurat thi? usase is ghatana ke bare main sateek jaankaree mil sakati thi?10-adityake ghar waalon ko unke bete kii postmortem report kii copy kyon nahin di gai? He said that Rewari Superintendent of Police Rajesh Duggal, who was accused of failing in prompt action in the case, has been dropped and he will be replaced by Superintendent of Police Rahul Sharma, who is under the security of the Chief Minister

 Ranbir Kapoor was only 10 years old when he saw his heroine on the film screen, Sanjay Dutt for the first time in real life

 There he first saw the actor whose picture Ranbir had put on his wardrobe
 unhone vah poster apni bahan kii aalmaari par lage unke pasandida actor salmaan khan ke saath pratidwandvita main lagaaya tha
 Kapoor recalls, "his saajan in the poster was the look of the film
 lambey bal, kaanon main yearring daale cigarette kaa kash lete hue, ve bade style main chal rahe the
 "young Ranbir used to think that Kisanjay Duttahi was a" super cool "hero, even more cool than his father Rishi Kapoor
 jab kisi ke liye aisi sundar yaaden hon to koi bhi yahi sochega ki kapur bade parade par apane adarsh kaa kirdaar nibhaane ko lekar bahut utsuk rahe honge
 But here the matter was reversed
 kapur sweekaar karte hai ki jab unhen yah role ofer hua to ve iske liye taiyaar nahin the kyonki unhen khud par andeh tha ki ve shaayad kirdaar ke saath puraa nyaay nahin kar paaenge
 Kapoor, 35, who is to appear in a historical action film Shamshera alongside Dutt, says, "it was very difficult to play the role of a person who still exists today
 ''shamshera kii shooting disambar main shuru hogi
 Kapoor says, "if the character you are going to play, if he is not in this world or a historical character, then you can take some leeway
 unka jivan ek aisi patakatha jaisaa he jo sidhe swarg se likhakar ai he
 "this script, written by Rajkumar hirani-abhijeet Joshi, is the story of a person's bad habits, weaknesses and life's disaster
" kapur kehete hai, "mujhe nahin lagata, main kisi filmmekar ke saamne khud ko itnaa kholoongaa
 You have made mistakes, it is very hard to accept it
 ''kirdaar main dhalanakapur ne sanjay dutt ke kirdaar main khud ko dhaalane ke liye bahut mehnat kii he lekin ve iskaa bad-chadhakar bakhaan karne se bachate hai
 Seeing the teaser and trailer of the film, viewers are of the opinion that Ranbir seems to be exactly Sanjay Dutt
 mumbai main rimjhim barish ke bich ek shaam ko india today ke cover pej ke liye chale ek ghante ke shoot ke dauraan ranbir ne kai baar yah baat doharaai, "koi bhi kalakaar apane kirdaar ko gambhirtha se letaa hi he or use lenaa bhi chahie
 Kapoor goes from happy Sanju in a very easy manner to sad Sanju and during that time he shows his best acting abilities
 "main apane kaam ko lekar chhadam buddhijiviyon jaisaa nahin laganaa chahta
 i understand the responsibilities and try to play my character honestly
 ''is film ke liye taiyaari karne main unhen chah maheene lage jisamen se ek bada samay dutt ke video clips or filmein (rocky, naam, khalanaayak, vastav, munna bhai embibies vagairah) dekhne, unki chaal-dhaal, andaaj or dialog bolne ke tareeke seekhney main laga
 Sanju was shot in reverse
 ranbir ko 50 saal se upar kii aayu vaale hero jaisaa dikhne ke liye 16 kilo vajan badhanaa padaa
 Makeup artists Vikram Gaikwad and Ajay Naik, experts Clover Wootton and Alim Hakeem who have both been hairdressers of both Dutt and Kapoor, to make the body look artificially, played a big role in bringing the six stages of Dutt's life to life onscreen
 is
 donon kii umr main 22 saal kaa faasla to he par donon kalakaaron ke jivan main kuch samanthaayen bhi rahi hai
 Kapoor also comes from a film family
 unke dada raaj kapur ne dutt kii maa naragis ke saath kam se kam 17 filmein kin thim
 He may not have 308 girlfriends as stated in Sanju's teaser, but with his heroines, he has been providing spice to the websites and tabloids of his love affairs
 kapur kehete hai ki ve hindi cinema main dutt ke filmi safar ko bahut baariki se dekhte rahe hai
 The father-son relationship, he also touches his heart
 kapur kehete hai, "bhartiya pita-putr ke sambandhon main antarvirodh kii sthiti rahati he
 This is not an easy relationship
 yahaan hamen najar aata he ki ek pita kin halaat se gujarata he
 The difference of generation with mutual co-ordination and the father standing to fight with difficulties for the son at the age in which the son should do so
 '' film main paresh rawal ne sunil dutt kii bhoomika nibhaai he
 If Dutt was looking for a support to revive his career after returning from the target on a big target, then Ranbir's situation is similar
 box offis par dher hoti filmon kaa silsilaa pichley saal i dil he mushkil tak chalaa he
 Their list of upcoming films suggests that they are now moving on a different path
 ve kehete hai, "main puure desh tak pahunchnaa chahta hum na ki keval aisi filmein karnaa chahta hum jo dakshini mumbai ke logon ko lubhaati hai
 "kapoor now wants to do films different from the role of a man with a lot of boyhood or a confused young man who tries to find a new life after knocking love in his life
" ve kehete hai ki iskaa arth yah nahin lagaaya janaa chahie ki maine ab tak jo filmein kii hai usko lekar man main koi pachhtaawaa he
 Now he is looking at such commercial, entertainment-rich films where setting foot is a big challenge
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki unhone sonu ke titu kii sweety jaisi saamaanya hit film ke nirmaataa lav ranjan ko massej karke poocha ki kya unke paas aisi koi film he jis par donon saath-saath kaam kar sakate hai? yah teesri film he jisamen kaam karne kii baat kapur ne sweekaar kii he
 Ranbir has become more sensible than before, it will be known only after the release of Sanju
 par ek badale ranbir kapur ke sanket to milane hi lage hai jo khulkar sweekaarte hai ki ve brahmastra kii sah-kalakaar aalia kapur ke saath prem main hai or unke saath saarvajanik rup se bhi dekhe jate hai
 He says, "if i talk about it in every interview, it will continue to be the headline
 main ise garima dena chahta hum
 "they seem sensitive to some changes in life, but some things rarely change
" jaise kharrate bharne vaale apane do mastiff nasl ke kutton gido or leo ke liye pyaar, jinka naam unhone apni pasandida italvi film life ij beautiphul ke mukchay kalakaaron ke naam par rakhaa he yaa phir footbal team epasi barsilona or argentinian footballar leonelle mesi ke liye deewangi
 They are not going to step into social media
 unhen ab bhi ekant pasand he
 He says, "whenever i am in a public place, i am very alert
 main jaanata hum ki yah mere kaam ke vipareet he lekin main ise thik karne kii koshish kar rahaa hum
 This is necessary but not as much as i have not tried much so far
 '' yah ek actor kaa vinamrata se bharaa atmamoolyankan he jisane vek ap cid!, rocket singh celsman of da year, rockstar, or barfi jaisi filmon main umdaa adaakaari se darshakon kaa dil jeeta tha
 Even though Kapoor believes that he is not mature enough for a biopic, he has managed to make an impression
 is khubi kii darkaar har hero ko rahati he
 *** aaj bharat mahaan uplabdhiyon ke pravesh dwaar par khadaa he
 In the next few years, we will become a fully literate society
 hamen shiksha ke maapdand or bhi oonche karne honge tabhi ham ek purnataya shikshit or susanskrit samaaj ban sakenge
 All of us are partners in the pursuit of these goals
 jab ham in lakshyon ko hasil karenge, to ham apni ankhon ke saamne apane desh main hota hua vyapak badlaav dekh sakenge
 Thus we will be the bearers of this change

 In September, the Environment Ministry claimed to keep the Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj free of plastic pollution in early 2019
 mantralay ne daawa kiya ki mela main kisi bhi tarah kii plastic istemaal nahin kii jaae isaki khaas taiyaari kii ja rahi he
 On examining this claim, it was found that mineral water in the form of Bisleri has already made a place in the Kumbh Mela
 ek maheene tak chalane vaale is meley main deshbhar se darjanon dharmik math or akhaade pravaas ke liye pahunchate hai
 Throughout the month, where these monasteries and akharas hold religious meetings and discourses throughout the day, a bhandara is also run for lakhs of devotees who reach the fair
 lekin hairaani is baat kii he ki is saal meley kii taiyaari ke liye prayagraj or aasapaas ke ilaakon main kumhaar pariwaron ko abhitak bhandare samet mela sambandhit kisi praayojan ke liye mitti ke bartan kaa order nahin mila he
 For the past several decades, 100 families of the potter caste have been present in Bairahana locality near Allahabad Fort
 ye parivaar jahaan salbhar ganga kinare mitti nikaalkar shahar ke liye mitti ke bartan banaate hai vahiin prati varsh hone vaala mela inke liye badi kamai lekar aata he
 Nehru Indira failed, will PM Modi make India P-6? Suresh Kumar, a potters businessman, told that 6 years ago in Kumbh, he got orders and advance to make 10 lakh kulhada and parai from all big monasteries and akhadas
 yah advance unhen mela shuru hone se 6 maheene pehle de diya gaya or unka puraa parivaar prati saptaah ek lakh kullahad banane main jute gaya
 Suresh Kumar said that due to the amount received in advance, not only were he able to deliver the entire order ahead of time in the fair area but in the remaining time after completing the large order, he also made utensils for retail sale during the fair in the fair area
 Got it
 ek anya kaarobaari abhaya kumaar ne bataaya ki is saal mela main kullahad or parai kaa istemaal na ke baraabar rahegaa
 According to Abhay, if he and other potters families now get orders from monasteries and akharas, they cannot complete the work of making utensils before the fair starts in Surat
 abhaya ne kaha ki kumbh mela ke liye bartan banane kaa kaam ab khatm ho gaya he
 Abhay expressed the possibility that in Kumbh this year, the government and religious institutions will remain dependent on the pottery option
 abhaya kaa ishaara pani ke liye bisaleri kii bottle or khaane ke liye plastic or thermakol kii thaliyaan mitti ke bartanon kii jagah lenge
 The trade deficit from China is bringing America and India together? These claims of Abhay and Suresh are also confirmed in the picture of the religious meetings being held in Ayodhya, Prayagraj and Kashi before the Kumbh Mela

 He later said through a tweet that the bjp's national IT cell chief had already informed the Election Commission about the dates of the Karnataka election through a tweet
 ayog ne gujarat chunaav ko himachal chunaav se alag kiya tha taaki pradhanmantri modi tabadatod ghoshnaaen kar saken
 The Commission then delayed the press conference only with the Prime Minister's announcements
 chunaav ayog ne haalanki daawa kiya he ki karyaalay sambandhi kaaryo ko lekar ghoshnaa karne main vilamb hua
 Earlier, the Congress leader raised questions through social media to change the timing of the press conference to announce the dates for the elections in five states
 unhone twit kar kaha ki teen tathyon par aap khud nishkarsh nikaal sakate hai
 Election Commission to announce the election dates of five states at 12 noon
 30 baje press conference karne kii baat kahi
 3 Facts- Draw your own conclusions

 3

 supreme court ne hai corts main jajon kii niyukti main ho rahi deree ko lekar gahari naaraazgi jataai he
 The Supreme Court said in a strict tone that you cannot bring the entire institution (judiciary) in a state of jam
 supreme court ne kaha ki ye halaat tab hai jabaki colegium kii ore se is sandarbh main siforishein bheji ja chuki hai
 a bench headed by Chief Justice TS Thakur of the Supreme Court said, "the courts are locked, do you want to lock the judiciary?" "chif justise ne ye bhi kaha ki aap kisi puri sanstha ko dhire-dhire jam kii sthiti main nahin laa sakate
 The Chief Justice said that the process of appointment cannot be stopped as the Memorandum of Procedure (mop) related to the appointment of judges is not finalized
 supreme court ne jajon kii niyukti ko lekar filon ke sust raftaar se badhane kii aalochana kii
 The Supreme Court cautioned that they can summon the PMO and the Secretaries of the Ministry of Law to know the real situation
 supreme court kii teen sadasyeey bench main justise di vaai chandrachud or justise el nageshwar raav bhi shaamil hai
 The bench stated, "there should be no deadlock
 aap mop ko antim rup die bina jajon kii niyukti kii prakriya ke liye patibaddh hai
 The finalization of mop has nothing to do with the process of appointment of the judiciary
 supreme court ne vibhinn hoicorts main jajon kii kami kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki karnataka hoicourt main kai court rums main taale latakaane pade hai kyonki vahaan jaj nahin hai
 Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the Central Government, said that the finalization of mop is not an issue
 rohtagi ne bench ko aashwaasan diya ki jajon kii niyukti ko lekar nikat bhavishya main adhik pragati dekhi ja sakegi

 bataa den ki 14 sitambar ko centre sarkaar ne supreme court ko bataaya tha ki ucch str par nyaaypalika main jajon kii niyukti ko lekar koi 'blem game' yaa 'logzam' nahin he
 The Center also held the High Courts responsible for 'delaying' the process of appointment of judges in the High Courts
 isse pehle supreme court ne kaha ki wo jajon kii niyukti main 'logzam' bardaasht nahin karegaa
 The Supreme Court said that it would have to intervene to speed up accountability as the delivery system of justice is crumbling
 supreme court ne kaha ki agar sarkaar ko jajon kii niyukti ke sandarbh main kisi naam ko lekar aapatti he to uske paas colegium ke paas dobaaraa aane kaa vikalp hameshaa khulaa he
 The Supreme Court has rejected the petition filed against the ordinance brought by the Central Government regarding the triple talaq bill
 somvaar ko daayar kii gai yachika ko supreme court ne sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya
 Let us know that in February last month, the Modi cabinet gave approval to increase the ordinance brought for triple talaq
 ye nayaa adhyadesh june tak lagu rahegaa, jiske baad agar is kanoon ko jari rakhana hoga to dobaaraa adhyadesh laana hoga

 Former Cabinet Secretary BK Chaturvedi (BK Chaturvedi) has raised serious questions over the CAG report on two-g spectrum and coal block allocation
 kaig kii tu-ji kii report kii aalochana karte hue unhone kaha, '2008 ke aarambh main die gaye license main ghate kii gananaa karne ke liye 2010 main 3-ji ke aavanton ke aankadon kaa istemaal unhone is prakaar taiyaar kiya jaise maano kaig ghate ke aankade ko badha-chadhaakar pesh karnaa chahta ho or piesi (sansad kii loklekha samiti) ke bajaay janata ke saamne parosna chahta ho'
 Former Cabinet Secretary (BK Chaturvedi) says that the audit body has tried to usurp the role of government in policy making and enter the field of policy making
 bike chaturvedi (BK Chaturvedi) ne apni kitaab 'chalanges of gavarnes : insiders vyuu' main likhaa, "tuji maamle main kaig kii report main aise sawaal uthaae gaye hai jinke shashan-pranali or isaki lekhapariksha ke drushtikon ko lekar gambhir nihitarth hai"
 The retired IAS officer has said this in relation to an issue that caused a huge political uproar during the tenure of United Progressive Alliance-2 and caused uproar in Parliament for several weeks
 unhone kaha, "haalanki license ke aavanton main trutiyon ko ujagar karne main kaig sahi tha, lekin usne sambhavit ghate kaa masalaa bhi uthaaya jise sarkaar ke rajasav kaa ghaataa bataaya gaya"
 Estimates of market value of losses by CAG in 2G allocations ranging from Rs 33,000 crore to 1
 76 lakh karod rupee kiya gaya
 Highlighting this wide variation, the top bureaucrat wrote, "by estimating the potential deficit as the government's deficit, the CAG tried to usurp the role of government in policy making"
 chaturvedi ne kaha, 'jab faisla liya jaataa he to puure ghate kaa akalan sarkaar kii niti ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Many pricing structures are sometimes lower than the market price
 yah aarthik vikaas ko tej karne yaa seva kaa vistaar karne ke liye jaruri ho sakati he"

 Street food is a weakness of some people
 lekin un sabaki ek kamajori or hoti he, vah he kamjor pachan tantra
 
 
 Yes, eating mostly street food spoils the digestive system
 is baat kii koi guarantee nahin ki jo street food aap kha rahe hai vah kitni safai or sahi chizon se banaaya gaya he
 So it is important that whenever you eat street food, keep in mind certain things
 sadak kinare milane vaale khaadya padaarth yani street foods adhikansh log bade chaav ke saath khate hai, lekin inke seven se apach hone, pet main gas banane yaa anya bimaariyaan hone kaa khatra bana rahata he
 Experts say that eating spicy, oily food is suitable in the summer season and during the monsoons
 kai prakaar ke snacks masale hue aalu se banaae jate hai, jo kaaphi der tak khule main rakhe hue ho sakate hai, inhen khaane se bachein
 When fresh snacks are not used while making snacks like samosa and dumplings, due to not being kept for long time, eating them can cause gas in your stomach, causing acidity
 barsaat ke dauraan nami ke kaaran khamir vaale bhojya padaarth jaise chhole-bhature main fafoond lag jane kii sambhaavna zyada hoti he, isliye is tarah ke bhojan ko khaane ke dauraan ehtiyaat baraten, saamaanya rup se barsaat kaa mausam masaaledaar or taileey bhojan ke seven ke liye acha mana jaataa he
 The food items sold on most roads are made in the open, so there is a possibility of exposure to contaminated rain water
 kuch food stall khuli naaliyon ke aas-paas sthit hote hai, jahaan coliform bacteria ke sampark main aane kii sambhaavna bad jaati he or isse aap diaria jaisi beemaari ke chapet main aa sakate hai
 Spice water used in street food, especially in your favorite golgappa, can be made from contaminated water, causing you to get diseases caused by contaminated water such as cholera, typhoid
 sadak par jo falon ke zeus bikate hai, ho saktaa he ki ve kaaphi der se khule main rakhe hon or vahi baad main aapako pine ke liye die jaaen, jisase aap biimaar pad sakate hai or jin gilaason main inhen pine ke liye diya jaataa he, unke bhi gande hone kii sambhaavna rahati he
 If kulfi and ice balls are not prepared with cleanliness, then eating them can also cause stomach problems
 dooshit pani se pet yaa aant main jalan, diaria or typhoid va cholera jaisi gambhir bimaariyaan ho sakati hai
 The chances of getting such diseases are increased due to the dirty water sprinkling clothes, hands and feet on the road filled with dirty water
 vibhinn rogaanuon ke alaava bhumigat jal main hanikaarak chemical bhi maujuud ho sakate hai, kyonki ye aasaani se bhumigat jal main samaa jate hai, isliye pani ko pine se pehle use filter kar len yaa ubaal len

 com / 6gd4jv6zat The nine states of the country are facing drought conditions and the Supreme Court expressed concern while hearing a petition
 court ne kaha ki vahaan ke halaat gambhir hai or centre sarkaar is baat se inkaar nahin kar sakati ki vahaan halaat kharaab hai
 The central government can judge the situation properly and steps should be taken for this
 court ne kaha ki ye bahes kaa mudda nahin he, aapako raahat deni hi padegi
 The Center should not take the matter the opposite way, as Prashant Bhushan questions the government's functioning
 is maamle main yachika ye he ki sarkaar sookhaa prabhavit logon ke liye or bhi kadam uthaae
 The Supreme Court questioned the Center and said that there are drought conditions in 9 states, in such a situation the government cannot remain blind to the problems of the people
 sarkaar ko fatkaar lagaate hue court ne kaha ki ham yahaan par mid de mile or duusari yojanaon ke moolyankan par sunwaayee nahin kar rahe
 The comments court ne kaha - ham sookhaa prabhavit rajyon ke logon ko raahat kaise mili, is masale par sunwaayee kar rahe hai
 We want to know what the government is doing for the drought affected people and what they will do in the future
 court ne kaha ki ham sookhe ke halaat ko lekar chintit hai, logon kii madad karnaa chaahate hai
 The court asked the central government that the money given to the states under the MNREGA reaches the people? The court said that nothing can be done by merely saying that so many thousands of crores of rupees have been allocated for the scheme
 jo kah rahe hai uskaa aadhaar bhi hona chahie
 The court remarked that why are the money owed to the people working under the MNREGA? The government wants to say that the laborer who worked last year will get money this year
 centre sarkaar halaat ko sahi tareeke se jaj kar sakati he or iske liye kadam uthaae jane chahie
 The court said that this is not a matter of debate, you have to give relief
 centre is maamle ko vipareet tareeke se naa le kyonki prashanth bhushan sarkari kaamkaaj par sawaal uthaate hai
 The petition in this case is that the government should take more steps for the drought affected people
 supreme court ne centre par sawaal uthaae or kaha ki 9 rajyon me sookhe ke halaat hai, aise main logon kii dikkaton par sarkaar aankh munde nahin rah sakati
 Slamming the government, the court said that we are not hearing the assessment of mid-day meal and other schemes here
 tippaniyan The court said - We are hearing on the issue of how the people of drought affected states should get relief
 ham jaananaa chaahate hai ki sookhaa prabhavit logon ke liye sarkaar kya kar rahi he or bhavishya me kya karegi
 The court said that we are worried about the drought situation, want to help the people
 court ne centre sarkaar se poocha ki manaregaa ke tahat jo paisa rajyon ko diya jaataa he kya wo logo tak pahunchataa he? court ne kaha ki keval kehane se kuch nahin hota ki itane hajaar karod rupee yojana ke liye aavantit kiye hai
 There should be a basis for what you are saying
 court ne tippanee karte hue kaha ki manaregaa ke tahat kaam karne vaale logon kaa paisa bakaayaa kyon he? sarkaar ye kahana chaahati he ki pichley saal jis majdoor ne kaam kiya, use paisa is saal milegaa

 CM Yogi attacked the BSP, SP and RLD alliance strongly
 siem yogi ne kaha ki upi main gathbandhan puri tarah se fail ho gaya he
 The BJP will form a government with a strong majority in the country
 party upi main 74 se zyada seat jeetegi
 At the same time, SP-BSP governments did nothing for the people of the state
 agar kiya hota to swaabhaavik rup se janata kaa rujhaan inke prati hota, isliye inke saath aane se bhi vot shift nahin hoga
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that the people do not take these elections as seriously as the general elections

 On December 20, outside the Holi Lodge, the residence of Virbhadra Singh, the capital of the hill state of Himachal Pradesh, a burst of firecrackers is clearly showing the resurgence of the Congress
 is kayapalat kii patakatha akele likhane vaale vyakti vahaan khadey the, jahaan unhen sabase zyada sahaj lagata he: pataakhon ke bich
 78-year-old Virbhadra Singh, the indomitable king of Bushehr and five-time chief minister of Himachal Pradesh, registered a stunning victory over outgoing chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal
 bijepi is bharose dobaaraa satta main aane kii aas lagaae baithi thi ki upie par bhrashtachar kaa daag lagane kii vajah se desh kii janata kaa usase mohabhang ho gaya he
 The factor went against the Congress in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and even Uttarakhand, where it won a minor majority in the early 2012 elections
 himachal ne is saal congress ko pehali nirnaayak jeet di he
 Dhumal hoped that the charge of taking bribe imposed on Virbhadra while he was Union Steel Minister would go against him
 virbhadra ne kaha, ''yahaan ke log jaanate hai ki mere khilaaf lagaae gaye aarope kaalpanik hai
 "I had already told you," he said, showing the same gesture, "I am an honest man with all my heart
" ”virbhadra or unke 22 varshiya putr vikramaditya, donon ne hari pattee vaali himachali topi pahan rakhi thi
 This hat has become his identity
 apane ek jaise haris twid kot ke neeche unhone gale main pashmina mafalar baandh rakhaa tha
 This veteran leader said, "I have to take a big broom to clean up the rot that has deepened in the administration
 ” unhone kaha ki unki sarkaar 'aam aadmi kii sarkaar’ hogi
 Does this mean that he will become the Chief Minister once again? Virbhadra does not want to create a new controversy on such a day when according to himself he has won the most difficult election
 apni ankhon main chamak ke saath unhone kaha, ''iske liye qatari lagi he or main usamen kudana nahin chahta
 Expressing full confidence in the party high command with a clever smile, he said, "the decision of who will become the chief minister has to be decided entirely by the high command and i am a trusted soldier of the party
" ”congress ke bheetar unke pratidwandvi is baat par jor dete hai ki mukhyamantri karyaalay tak kaa virbhadra kaa is baar kaa rasta pehle jaisaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Former Himachal Pradesh Congress chief Kaul Singh Thakur says, "how will CM become? What happens when they say this faisla to hikeman ko karnaa he
 "thakur hopes that his proximity to Union Minister Anand Sharma will lead him to the Chief Minister's chair
 sutron ne sanket diya he ki virbhadra kii sambhaavnaaon ko palitha lagane kaa kaam nattejey aane se pehle hi shuru ho chukaa he
 Another loyalist of Anand Sharma, AICC Himachal Pradesh general secretary in-charge Birendra Singh has not concealed his uneasiness towards Virbhadra
 unhone dilli main 16 disambar ko party pratyaashiyon kii ek baithak bulaai thi
 According to party sources, this exercise was done to catch the reaction of the leaders on the alternative leadership in the state
 sonia gandhi kii pasandida vidya stokes bhi kursi kii aas lagaae hue baithi hai haalanki ve biimaar hai
 Stokes, 84, is the eldest leader to have won the election for the eighth time
 party main virbhadra virdohi kheme kii yojana he ki unke khilaaf lage bhrashtachar ke aaropon kaa hawala dekar unhen mukhyamantri banane se roka jaae
 Even on the day of victory, Delhi's response was clearly sluggish
 virbhadra singh ne india today se kaha, ''nahin, abhi unhone (sonia) phone nahin kiya he
 She will call aakhirkaar puraa chunavi abhiyaan unke hi nirdesan main chalaaya gaya he
 "former minister Harsh Mahajan says," The high command is aware that if Virbhadra Singh had not been made the head of the state Congress less than a month before the election, the party would not have won even half of its seats
 ” unhone daawa kiya ki rahul gandhi ne baar-baar yah sanket diya he ki congress kii jeet par virbhadra singh ko hi mukhyamantri banaaya jayega
 Confident but confident Virbhadra indicated that he would not give up easily without fighting if he was denied the top position
 unhone kaha, ''log mujhe bahut acchhee tarah se jaanate hai
 This will be my sixth term as Chief Minister
 yah sirf isliye ho sakaa he ki log, yahaan tak ki bijepi ko vot dene vaale log bhi mujhmen or meri sarkaar main bharosa karte hai
 "on the other hand, Prem Kumar Dhumal of BJP conceded defeat
 unhone kaaphi dur gujarat ke jaadu kaa ansh hasil karne ke liye din kii shuruyaat apane 'achche dost’ narendra modi ko phone karke kii
 Three hours later, he was congratulating his arch-rival Virbhadra
 aakhirkaar bijepi ke liye kuch bhi kaam na aayaa—unke sabhi abhiyaanon main alpiji silinderon kii gharelu aapurti par centre sarkaar ke ankush kaa virodh shaamil tha
 Before the election, the central government had announced to limit the number of LPG cylinders available to each family
 centre ke is upaay ko logon ne party ke liye aatmghaatee qaraar diya tha or unhen lag rahaa tha ki chunaav main matadaata apni naaraazgi dikhaa sakate hai
 But the BJP leaders did not work hard to cash in on the public sentiment against this measure which set the kitchen on fire
 shaayad dhumal ne virbhadra kii salaah maan lee thi
 Virbhadra had said before his supporters at Rajiv Bhavan, "how long will you continue to blame the central government for every problem of your people?" After all, you have to do something
 ” iske baad bagal main khadey ek sahyogi se unhone dhire se kaha, ''kya unhen pataa nahin he ki hamaare graminon ke paas lakdi ke rup main eendhan kii aseemit aapurti he, isliye ve apana khaanaa pakaane ke liye gas silinder kaa intjaar nahin karte?”is tarah kii vyaavhaarik salaah aisa vyakti hi de saktaa he jisaki janata kii nabj par pakad ho
 Virbhadra Singh has snatched Himachal Pradesh from the BJP and put it in the hands of the Congress
 aise main unke samarthakon kii yah ummid beja nahin he ki party iskaa ehsaan jarur chukaayegi

 1
 All the security agencies including our forces have shown our strength to the world by the surgical strike

 They did their work everywhere whether terrorism or infiltration

 India is capable of doing this, we are capable of encouraging anything against the country

 koyala ghotaale kii sabase badi khabar, ek aisi khabar jise khud sarkaar nahin jhuthla sakati kyonki ye jaanch report kaig kii nahin he balki ye khud sarkaar kii apni agency sibiai kii report he
 Aaj Tak has a copy of the FIR of the CBI, such documents have been sent to the hands of the accused, which shows how there was a big scam in the allocation of coal mines
 hamaare haath lagi he sibiai kii exiaar
 According to this FIR, Darda and his companies resorted to lies and fake documents in the allocation of coal blocks
 sabase chaunkaanewaali baat to ye he ki tatkaaleen koyala rajyamantri santosh bagrodiya ko in sabake bare main pataa tha, phir bhi unhone koyala khadaan kaa aavanton inhen hone diya
 Manoj Jaiswal's company has also been revealed to be involved in this dark exploitation of coal
 jis koyale ne puure desh main aag laga di, jis koyale ne puraa monsoon satr jala diya, jis koyale ne pradhanmantri kii chhavi par kaalikh pot di, usee koyale kii ye sabase kaali khabar he
 Documents are telling that the truth of coal scam of one lakh 86 thousand crores was felt even by the chair of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 par sarkaar koyale se nikali aag par ab tak yahi kehete hue pani daalati rahi ki kaig kii report galat or adhuri he
 There was no problem in allocating coal blocks
 koi bhai-bhatijawad nahin hua
 Aaj Tak will tell you how the government has been speaking so far for black coal
 ji haa
 These documents will tell you the truth after which no question, no doubt, no cross-examination will be required
 koyale kaa sara kaala sach aapke saamne hoga
 The report of the FIR is in the hands of Ajatjak, the stripped of the rules
 exiaar us ghotaale kii, jo desh ke itihaas kaa sabase kaala ghotaalaa mana ja rahaa he
 This scam is about allocation of coal mines
 ek lakh 86 hajaar karod ke ghotaale main ajtak ne jutai he sibiai FIR kii copy
 According to this copy, it is being revealed how the coal blocks were allotted to the company of Congress leaders by lying and ignoring the rules
 idhar monsoon satr koyale main jal rahaa tha or udhar thik usee dauraan teen sitambar ko achaanak khabar aati he ki kol block aavanton ko lekar sibiai ek saath kai jagah chaape maar rahi he
 These raids of the CBI, along with Congress MP Vijay Darda and his family in the Rajya Sabha, were also killed on the companies of the Jaiswal family of Nagpur
 ye khabar to aap sabko pataa he
 Now know the real news behind this news
 darda parivaar ne chhupaai sachchaiaap jaanate hai sibiai ne darda parivaar kii companiyon par kyon chaape maare? darasal tatkaaleen koyala rajya mantri santosh bagrodia ne tamaam niyam-kanoon taak par rakh kar apane pad kaa durupyog karte hue darda parivaar par khaas meharbaani kii thi
 We are not making this accusation
 naa hi ye kaig report main he
 Rather these things are recorded in the CBI FIR on whose basis the CBI raided the companies of Darda family
 ajtak ke haath main maujuud he wo kaagazat jo bataate he ki us samay ke koyala rajya mantri santosh bagrodia ne bhi jaanboojhkar niyamon kii undekhi kii jisase karodon arabon rupee ke koyale kii bandarbaant hui
 Darda's company had sat in the room of Minister of State for Coal Santosh Bagrodia and told him that his company had already got coal blocks, but yet another coal block was given to Darda's company
 niyam ke mutabik kol block hasil karne se pehle har company ko ye bataanaa zaruri hota he ki use pehle se koi kol block aavantit kiya he yaa nahin? magar exiaar ke hisaab se darda parivaar ke paas pehle se paanch-paanch kol blaak the iske baavjood jab unhone chathe kol block ke liye aavedan kiya to us aavedan patr main iskaa koi zikr nahin kiya
 While the minister was fully aware of this
 tatkaaleen mantriji ko pataa thi sachchaisibiai kii exiaar ke mutabik 18 sitambar ko koyala rajya mantri santosh bagrodia ke saath hui baithak main company ne mana ki uske paas pehle se hi paanch kol blaak hai
 But it was not mentioned in the application form
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki mantri ji kii jaankaree hone ke baavjood company ko kol blaak kaise aavantit kar diya gaya?aavedan patr main sach chupaane ke baavjood wo sach mantri ji ko pataa tha
 Nevertheless, despite giving incorrect information, the minister instead of canceling the application, allotted the sixth coal ballock to the Darda family
 exiaar main sabase chaukaaney vaali baat ye bhi he ki 18 sitambar 2008 ko tatkalin koyala rajya mantri santosh bagrodiya ke saath hui baithak main eem aayran and steel company ne ye jaanboojhkar jhooth bolaa ki is company kaa jaisawal samooh se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Coal ministry officials were also complicit in the preliminary investigation by CBI revealed that some officials of the Ministry of Coal tried to benefit the AMR company as part of a well-planned conspiracy and ignored the information that it already had five Coal block is allocated
 eemr aayran and steel company ne kol block ke aavanton ke liye die aavedan patr main tathyon ko naa keval chipaaya balki galat jaankaree dekar kol block hasil kiya
 According to the FIR, some government officials also helped Darda Parivar's company in allotting coal blocks
 eemr aayran and steel company kaa ye daawa farji tha ki wo ek jane maane bijnes samooh ke liye kaam kar rahaa he
 While this was not the truth
 company ne ye jhooth sirf apni company kaa moolyankan badhaane ke liye bolaa tha taaki use kol block hasil karne main dikkat naa aae

 In Haryana, with the support of BJP independents, the government has won the election results of the Maharashtra and Haryana Legislative Assembly of Bhupendra Hooda by Congress majority in Haryana
 donon hi suubon main phir se bijepi sarkaar kii vaapasi ho rahi he
 The bjp-shiv Sena alliance in Maharashtra has got an absolute majority, while in Haryana, the BJP is busy forming a government with the support of independents
 ye chunaav congress ke liye ek aisa mauka sabit hue hai jise vah ganvaa chuki he
 In Maharashtra, the party has slipped to number four and its ally NCP has done better than that
 haryana main congress bahumat se kaaphi dur he, lekin bhupendra hooda ke netritv main party ke is pradarshan ko bhi saraahaa ja rahaa he
 The Congress was a victim of uncertainty and decision making
 dilli se mumbai or chandigarh tak farmaan bhejne main susti dikhaai gai jiskaa nateeja hua ki bich chunaav tak na party kii niti tay ho pai or na netritv
 In Maharashtra, Narendra Modi along with other allied leaders (photo-pti) failed to decide the policy in Maharashtra and the Congress in Maharashtra was battered in the campaign and contested without a face
 voting se kuch din pehle tak party apana mumbai adhyaksh khojati rahi, sanjay nirupam ke baad milind devda or phir ekanath gaekwad ko ain vakt main yah jimmedaari de gai phir bhi party main ekajutata nahin ban pai
 During the Congress elections, it was so thoughtful that all the top leaders including the party president did not go to the public and ask for votes
 rahul gandhi ke alaava kisi bhi bade netaa ne chunavi sabhaaon main hissaa nahin liya
 No major Maharashtra leader even showed up with him at Rahul Gandhi's rally
 mumbai congress ke purv adhyaksh devda ne khud ko chunavi sabhaaon se dur rakhaa or aakhri vakt main twit kar vot maangate dikhe
 In such a situation, the party was losing its first victory
 congress kii star prachaarak kahi ja raheen party mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ne kisi bhi rajya main prachaar nahin kiya
 She confined herself to UP politics
 modi sarkaar kii nitiyon par vah sirf twitor ke jariye nishaanaa sadhti hai
 The party did hold a press conference with former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at the last moment of campaigning but in the wake of the Modi government being surrounded, the stakes were turned backwards
 singh ke 370, saavarkar, enarasi or bainkon kii kharaab sthiti par bayaan party ke aadhikarik rukh se alag dikhe
 The biggest drawback of Congress in Maharashtra was its project leader
 is samay jab deshbhar main chunaav chehre or chhavi par lade ja rahe hai tab congress ke paas maharashtra main koi cheharaa nahin tha
 Whether former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan or Ashok Chavan was the Chief Minister before him, the Congress could not muster the courage to put forward anyone's name
 bijepi ke paas devendra fadanvis the to shivasena ke paas uddhav or aditya thakare kii pita-putr kii jodi
 If the NCP was contesting under the leadership of Maratha Kshatrap Sharad Pawar, the Congress did not appear to have leaders along with the policy
 bhupendra singh hooda or kumari shailaja (tasviir saabhaar- pti)haryana main durust aae magar der se aehryana kii baat kii jaae to yahaan bhi sthiti zyada alag nahin thi
 The party was divided into two factions due to the fight between Ashok Tanwar and Bhupendra Hooda
 alaakaman is ghamaasan se aankh munde rahaa
 It came even as Bhupendra Hooda threatened to leave the party
 tak jaakar congress netritv ne hooda ko free hand diya or aakhri vakt main kumari shailaja ko pradesh adhyaksh banaakar maidan main utaara gaya
 Tanwar could not tolerate this change and stayed away from the party
 haryana ke nattejey bataate hai ki hooda par party alaakaman kaa daanv durust tha
 Hooda surprised political pundits by winning 31 seats to Congress
 yani alaakaman ne agar haryana par apana faisla latakaae na rakhaa hota or pehle se hi hooda ko chunaav kii kaman saunp di hoti to nattejey behatar ho sakate the
 Hooda mobilized himself against the BJP led by Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and Manohar Khattar
 bijepi virdohi votaron khaskar jat, muslim, daliton ko ve kaaphi had tak apane paale main laane main kaamyaab rahe
 His understanding was that while the entire BJP was talking about Article 370, Pakistan, NRC, Hooda did not make him an issue and confined his attack to the functioning of the state government and redeemed the anti-government wave in his favor like a leader in Haryana Confuse was also seen on Congress policy
 chunaav nattejey bataate hai ki modi kaa jaadu votaron ke sir chadhakar bolta he lekin jab chunaav pradesh ke hon to matadaata pradesh ke muddon or pradesh sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ko parakhkar voting karte hai
 The Congress failed to understand this and before the elections, such a political atmosphere was created as if the opposition in Haryana is fighting a losing battle
 bijepi ne 75 paar kaa jo naaraa diya usase janata mutmain nahin thi lekin congress mukhya vipakshi dal hone ke baavjood uske saamne sarender karti dikhi
 When all the exit polls (excluding Aaj Tak's exit poll) were giving 60 to 70 seats to the BJP, no one dared to challenge these figures from Congress except for Hooda's son and former MP Deepender Hooda
 rajdhani dilli ke sangam vihaar ilaake main aaj bhi ek mahila mafia kaa dar kaayam he
 In the area, this lady don is called 'mummy' out of fear
 baseeran naam kii is umradraj ladi don ke 8 beton ne ilaake main uskaa khauf kaayam kar rakhaa he
 The entire area is afraid of Basiran and his eight sons

 Though Basirin's empire of crime is slowly coming to an end, his two sons are behind bars and Basiran himself is absconding with his three sons
 vahiin uske teen bete zamaanat par hai
 On Saturday, a team of Sangam Vihar police raided in search of Basiran, but Basiran is still away from the police
 nashe kii lat lagava chote bacchon se karwaati thi jurmbaseeran or uske beton ke haath to aparaadh kii kaalikh se pute hi hue hai, vah ilaake ke maasoom bacchon ko bhi jurm kii duniya main dhakel detii thi
 She would first make the minor boys drug addicts and then teach them all the nuances of the crime
 itnaa hi nahin jab inanaaballig ladakon kii trainingpuri ho jaati to wo unase aise jurm karwaati, jisamen agar ve pakade bhi jaaen to aasaani se batch saken
 The fear of Basiran in the area was such that he also occupied the government borewell
 jise sarkari borwell se pani lenaa hota, use iske evaj main baseeran ko chadhaava chadhaanaa padataa tha
 It is said that Basiran would take the contract of crime and use her son and her children to teach her
 police ke mutabik, sangam vihaar ilaake main zyaadaatar naaballig bacchon ko jurm ke andhere raste par dhakelne kaa kaam is ladi don ne kiya he
 Coming under the influence of Basiran, these innocent children have done many big criminal incidents till now
 baseeran ke har bete par hai dheron kesasangam vihaar ilaake main khauf kaa paryaay ban chuki baseeran ke kul 8 bete hai or sabhi ek se badhkar ek apradhi
 According to the police, Basiran alone has 9 serious cases, including murder and murder
 vahiin uske sabase bade bete samim par 41 maamle, duusare bete shakeel par 15 maamle, tisare bete vakil par 13, chauthe bete sanni par 9, paanchaven bete faisal par 9, chathe bete rahul par 3 or saatven bete salmaan par 2 maamle darj hai
 Basiran's youngest son is still a minor, but he too has entered the world of garayam
 baseeran ke isanaballig bete par 11 maamledarj hai
 The cases registered against Basiran's sons include murder, attempt to murder, robbery, robbery, theft, possession of illegal arms and cases registered under the Excise Act
 is tarah detii thi police ko gachhasangam vihaar police baseeran or uske faraar beton kii talash main lagaataar dabish de rahi he, lekin ab tak police ke haath safalataa nahin lagi he
 Basiran's house located in Sangam Vihar area of delhi is currently sealed by a court order
 lekin kabhi isi makaan se dilli kii ye ladi don apana samrajya chalaati thi
 According to the police, this lady Dawn had CCTV cameras around her house to escape from the police, so that as soon as the police could get a sound, she along with her sons escaped from the house a few steps away
 itnaa hi nahin baseeran ke bete kisi jurm kii vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke baad isi jangal main jurm ke nishaan dafna dete the
 The police said that Basiran took a contract for killing his brother from a woman named Munni, who lived in the area, for 80 thousand rupees and killed him and buried the corpse in this forest
 philhal baseeran police giraft se baahar he is ilaake main uski khauf se azaadi sahi myne main tabhi milegi jab wo or uske faraar bete police giraft main aaenge
 On the one hand, while the Congress is opposing demonetisation across the country, on the other hand the Congress is preparing to make its office cashless
 party daftar kii canteen main logon se digital pement karne ko kaha ja rahaa he
 Canteen employee Sadiq said that we are facing lot of difficulties due to demonetisation, due to which people do not have cash

 dakshin pashchim monsoon kerala pahunch chukaa he
 The meteorological department has confirmed this
 kerala ke tateey ilaakon main jhamajham barish bhi hui he or monsoon kerala se karnataka kii ore bad chukaa he
 Earlier, the Monsoon Department had predicted the monsoon to reach Kerala on 6 June
 haalanki rajdhani dilli main monsoon ke pahunchane kii taarikh ko lekar abhi kuch spasht nahin he
 According to meteorological data, the normal date of arrival of monsoon in Delhi is 1st July
 lekin abhi bhavishyavaanee karnaa aasaan nahin he or iske liye sahi anumaan, mumbai or kolkata main monsoon pahunchane ke baad hi lagaaya ja sakegaa
 Every person in the country is waiting for the earth to rise in the pouring monsoon
 lekin is baar bhi badalon ne lucatipi kaa khel shuru kar diya he
 According to the Meteorological Department, the monsoon enters India through Kerala
 aamtaur par monsoon 1 june ko kerala main dastak detaa he, lekin is baar mausam vaigyanikon ne 5-6 june tak monsoon ke kerala pahunchane kii bhavishyavaanee kii
 The monsoon started on schedule this time and reached Andaman
 lekin uske baad monsoon kii hawaaen srilanka pahunchate pahunchate thamane lageen
 Due to this, the meteorological department's forecast of reaching Kerala by June 1 remained dashed
 ab monsoon kii hawaaon ne phir jor pakadaa he or ummid jataai ja rahi he ki desh ke baaki hisson main monsoon let nahin hoga
 This time the meteorologists had heard the surety of the arrival of monsoon
 lekin kudarat ke banate bigadate khel ke aage saare anumaan fail ho gaye
 The recent storm in the Philippines drew all the strength of the monsoon
 monsoon ke hawaaon kaa jor jaataa rahaa
 But according to the Meteorological Department, there will be sporadic rains of relief in the scorching heat in Delhi and surrounding areas

 Taking deep cognizance of the incident involving the beating of an officer by Akash Vijayargiya, the son of BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has advised that 'son should belong to anyone, will not be arbitrary

 Sources said that in the meeting of the BJP Parliamentary Party, the Prime Minister said on Tuesday, "son should belong to someone, such behavior will not be tolerated
" '' unhone kaha ki kisi bhi prakaar kaa durvyavhaar, jo party kaa naam kam karata he, asweekaarya he
 He said that action should be taken if someone has done something wrong
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki yah sabhi par lagu he
 According to sources, he said that no matter who has a son, he should be expelled from the party
 iske saath hi sutron ne bataaya ki piem modi ne yah bhi kaha he ki jinhone bhi unke jail se baahar aane ke baad swaagat kiya he, unhen bhi party se baahar kar dena chahie

 a case was registered with the police for this incident and Akash was sent to jail

 Not only this, firing was also done
 jail se jamaanat par chhootane ke baad akaash ne kaha tha ki vah janata kii seva karte rahenge lekin unhone is ghatana par khed prakat nahin kiya
 Akash's father and BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya had said that it was a very unfortunate incident
 ‘‘akashji or kamishnar donon kachche khilaadi hai
 It was not a big issue but it was made big
 '' unhone kaha tha, ‘‘mujhe lagata he ki adhikariyon ko ahamkaari nahin hona chahie
 "the question is that when PM Modi has said the action, then how long or how many hours will the BJP take to decide on this?" saaf he, yuai kaa paksh yahi he ki usne madad kii rakam abhi tak tay nahin kii he
 But before this the Indian government has refused to take it
 havala niti kaa diya ja rahaa he

 Some members, including rjd's Ramkripal Yadav, protested against not having a single female member or members of the small party in the select committee
 ucch sadan main carmik maamalon ke rajya mantri ve narayansami ne jab yah vidheyak charchaa or paarit karne ke liye rakhaa to sadan main lagbhag vahi najaara tha jo pichley saal 29 disambar ko dekhne ko mila tha
 Although the proposal for handing over the bill to the Select Committee was passed, the bill could not be passed on 29 December 2011 due to the lengthy discussion and adjournment of the House at midnight, despite heavy uproar
 narayansami ne 29 disambar ke ghatnakram kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki vidheyak par lambii charchaa huyi thi or sadasyon ne 197 sanshodhan pesh kiye the
 That day he could not complete his answer

 Narayanasamy was able to complete his talk, meanwhile SP Naresh Aggarwal proposed that the bill be sent to the Select Committee
 unhone iske liye vibhinn dalon ke 15 sadasyon ke naamon kii bhi peshkash kii
 After this proposal of Agarwal, a huge uproar in the House started

 All these members said that if any such proposal was to be brought, it should have come from the government
 iske jawaab main sansadeey kaarymantri pawan kumaar bansal ne bhi vibhinn niyamon kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki koi bhi sadsy sanshodhan ke jariye is tarah kaa prastaav kar saktaa he
 Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley said that the government has distributed the amended bill to members only on Sunday evening and it was brought to the House on Monday
 unhone kaha ki 1960 ke dashak se lokapal ke gathan ko taala ja rahaa he
 He said that the prestige of parliamentary democracy is at stake today
 jetali ne 29 disambar 2011 ko yaad karte hue kaha ki us din sadan lokapal vidheyak par nirnay ke behad kareeb pahunch gaya tha
 197 amendments were given to the bill but the main opposition was on four issues
 unhone kaha ki yadi us din mat vibhaajan hota to vipaksh ke kuch sanshodhan paarit ho jate
 He asked the Prime Minister to make it clear to the House and the country whether the government wants to make Lokpal or not
 unhone kaha ki puraa bajet satr nikal gaya lekin sarkaar us samay vidheyak lekar aayi jab satr khatm hone main ek din batch gaya he
 Jaitley said that the amended bill that the government has brought will be like a 'model' law for the states in the case of the Lokayukta
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ko yah baat nahin bhulani chahie ki jab tak do rajyon kii vidhansabhaon se aisa prastaav nahin aae tab tak vah model kanoon nahin bana sakati
 He said that the government can also send this bill to the Select Committee but it should come forward and propose in this regard itself
 basapa pramukh mayawati ne kaha ki sarkaar ko yah vidheyak jaldbaaji main nahin paarit karnaa chahie or use sabhi dalon kii is bare main raay leni chahie
 He said that the government should realize its responsibility
 mayawati ne bhi kaha ki sarkaar ko kisi sadsy ke prastaav kii bajaae swayan peshkash kerani chahie ki vidheyak ko pravar samiti main bheja jaae
 rjd's Ramkripal Yadav said that efforts are being made to end the democratic system through the Lokpal Bill
 unhone is baat par aapatti jataayi ki pravar samiti main ek bhi mahila, alpsankhyak, chote dal ke sadsy ko nahin rakhaa gaya he

 unhone kaha ki samiti kii report monsoon satr ke aakhri hafte ke pehle din saunpi jaaegi
 He said that the government proposes to keep the same members in this committee which the SP member had proposed earlier

 Unemployment was not an issue in the election
 aapako yaad hoga sarkaar ne neshnal stastical kamishan kii report jari karne par roak laga di thi
 The annual employment survey for 2017-18 was not released even after being approved
 iske virodh main neshnal statistical kamishan ke pi si mohanan or ji ve minakshi ne istipha de diya tha ki sarkaar aankadon ko chipa rahi he
 Today, the Ministry of Statistics of the Government of India released the periodic workforce survey report 2017-18
 sankhyikee vibhaag ke sachiv kaa kahana he ki aavadhik shrambal surveykshan main is baar paimaane badale gaye hai
 Therefore, comparison with old reports is not good

 The report released on 31 May considered the unemployment rate to be 6
 1 pratishat ho gai he
 Unemployment rate among youth available for employment in cities7
 8 pratishat he
 Unemployment rate among youth available for employment in villages5
 3 pratishat he
 This is an average figure but when viewed separately the situation looks frightening
 gaanvon main jo berojgaare he uskaa hamen andaaza bhi nahin he
 It is another matter that unemployment is not an issue, yet since it is written in the report then it becomes necessary to mention
 berojgaare kaa aankada ausat rup main to 6
 It seems like 1, but looking at the details of the report, the situation becomes more terrible
 2011-12 main gaanvon main 15 se 29 saal ke yuvaaon main berojgaare 5 pratishat thi
 Unemployment among boys in villages increased to 17 in 2017-18

 5 and 8
 8 pratishat ke bich rahi he

 2 percent
 disbanr main jo report jari honi thi or nahin hui usamen yah baat thi ki 45 saal main sabase adhik berojgaare dar he
 Even if we do not have that scale, the average unemployment rate in cities is 7
 8 pratishat kaaphi he
 On the other hand, many ministers including the Prime Minister took over their work and started work
 pradhanmantri modi cabinet kii pehali baithak main kuch mahatvapurn faisle liye gaye
 The government's decisions today show that the government's emphasis has gone on spending amid poor GDP and unemployment figures
 jis tarah se vyapaariyon or kisaanon ko pension dene ke vaade par faisla hua he, piem kisaan yojana kaa vistaar hua he, usase lagata he ki sarkaar logon ke haath main paisa dekar kharch kii kshamta badhanaa chaah rahi he
 But in this meeting, the Prime Minister took the first decision related to the martyred families
 desh kii raksha karte hue shahid hone vaale javaanon ke bacchon ke liye chaatravrutti kii raashi badha di gai he
 Not only this, the police service people who were martyred in terrorist and Naxalite attack have also been included in this scheme
 pradhanmantri ne apane pehle faisle ko bharat ko suraksha dene waalon ke naam samarpit kiya he
 The Prime Minister scholarship is given under the National Defense Fund
 ladakon kii chaatravrutti 2200 se badhaakar 2500 prati maah kar di gai he
 For girls, it has been increased from 2250 to 3000 per month
 yahi nahin kisaanon ke liye bhi badi ghoshnaa kii gai he
 PM Kisan Yojana has been expanded
 isamen 14 karod 50 lakh kisaan shaamil honge
 In the first PM Kisan Yojana, there were 12 crore small and marginal farmers
 ab sabhi kisaanon ko saal main 6000 milegaa
 For this, the government will have to spend 87000 crores every year
 vyapaariyon ko bhi 3000 pension kaa faisla cabinet ne clear kar diya
 3 crore retail merchants with less than 1
5 crore turnover will benefit
 60 saal ke kisaanon ko bhi 3000 pension dene kaa faisla hua he
 Amit Shah has become the Home Minister and Rajnath Singh is the Defense Minister
 narendra singh tomars krishi mantri bane hai or prakaash jhaavdekar soochna or prasaaran mantri
 Smriti Irani has been given the Ministry of Women and Child Development
 giriraaj singh ko pashupaalan, matsay paalan vibhaag kaa cabinet mantri banaaya gaya he
 The old ministry of Ram Vilas Paswan and Nitin Gadkari is found
 ek nayaa mantralay bana he jiskaa naam he jal shakti mantralay
 Its cabinet minister is Gajendra Singh Shekhawat
 jal sansaadhan, nadi vikaas or ganga sangrakshan mantralay tha jise badal kar jal shakti mantralay kar diya gaya he
 When the Ministry of Ganga Rejuvenation was formed, it used to investigate what is the result of the Ganga Ministry
 ab mantralay se ganga kaa naam hat gaya he
 Those who have not become ministers need not be disappointed
 ham samajhate hai ki samarthak ghur ghur kar pareshaan kar dete honge ki aap kyon nahin bane
 Would have pushed a little more
 aise saansadon ke paas ab bhi bahut kuch karne ke liye he
 He should remember that the BJP had cut tickets for more than 85 mps this time
 isliye saansad ke rup main bhi acha kaam kar mantri na ban paane kaa afsos mitaa sakate hai
 And even 36 people who were ministers in the previous government have not become ministers again
 jo mantri bane hai unke bare main baat kerani chahie
 Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank has been given the responsibility of handling the Ministry of Human Resources
 44 kitabon kii rachana kar chuke hai
 Apart from this, he was also the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand in part time
 5 baar vidhayak bane, saansad rahe
 That is why Nishank ji's political work was called part time because after such a busy responsibility, one should write 44 books, he should have got the Human Resource Ministry and got it
 nishank kii apni ek website bhi he jis par pehali pankti yah he ki nishank mul rup se saahitiyik vidha ke vyakti hai
 i am also telling you about this website so that you can also learn how much preparation politicians do in their public life
 vidhayak, mantri, mukhyamantri, saansad rahete hue 44 kitaaben likhnaa koi ludo kaa khel nahin he
 Nishank has written a collection of poems
 kahani sangrah likhaa he
 Novel and personality development has written several books in four categories
 mujhe vidhaataa bananaa he, meri vyathaa, meri katha, sansar kaayron ke liye nahin he, tum bhi mere saath chalo, khadey hue prashn, i vatan tere liye, toote daayre, apana-paraayaa, safalataa ke achook mantra
 It is also composed for children
 mehnat par bharosa karo, bhagya par nahin
 Just one wish
 nishank ji ne loksabhaa kii website par likhaa he ki nishank sahitya baarah bhashaaon main anuwaad hua he
 There has been research on Nishank literature in Indian and foreign universities
 inke lekhon ko bhartiya or videshi uniwarsity main padhaayaa jaataa he
 i am telling all this in connection with the introduction, but there is an appeal especially to the Vice Chancellor and Principal people not to start buying these books to impress the Minister
 mantri ji bhi vishesh rup se puuchhen ki aapane ye kitaab mere mantri banane ke baad padhi yaa pehle se padhi thi
 i have one more concern
 kai baar hota he ki mantri ji 44 kitabon ke lekhak hai to har librari main uski kharid dhadadhad hone lagati he
 Nishank Saheb can issue an order that after becoming a minister, his books should not be purchased for the government library
 un par hiton ke takaraav kaa aarope lag saktaa he
 Dr
 nishank khaali vakt main saamaajik or deshbhakti kii filmein dekhnaa pansad karte hai
 India seems to have got a qualified human resources minister
 ummid kii ja sakati he ki ve apni kitaab safalataa ke achook mantra kaa istamaal karte hue maanav sansaadhan mantralay ko badal denge
 The BJP has said in its manifesto that 200 Kendriya Vidyalayas and Navodaya Vidyalayas will be opened in the next five years
 ucch shiksha ke bare main kaha gaya he paanch vaade hai
 'in central law, engineering, science, management institutes, we will take all necessary steps to increase seats by at least 50 percent in the next five years
 pichley paanch saalon main hamane shikshon ke liye online paathyakramon ko ek behatar vikalp samajha he or inhen mahatv diya he
 In the next five years, we will make it a major resource for higher education
 kala, samskruti or sangeet vishvavidlaay kii sthapana karenge
 a University of Hospitality and Tourism and a Police University will be set up
 pichley paanch saalon main hamaara dhyaan ucch shaikshanik sansthaanon kii gunvattta badhaane par tha or utkrisht santhaan is ore badhaayaa gaya ek kadam ho
 We will take this forward and create 50 such institutions in the next five years i
e
 2024
 'ghoshnaptr main central uniwarsity main khaali pade padon ko bhare jane kaa koi vaada nahin he lekin online paathyakram ko vikalp banane par jor diya gaya he
 If the new government moves in this direction, then the campus will change significantly
 campus main bhartiyon par bhi asar padegaa
 On 3 December 2014, Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said in the Lok Sabha that astrology is the number one science
 uske saamne vigyaan kuch bhi nahin he
 It was said in the Lok Sabha that India had conducted nuclear testing millions of years ago
 ummid he nishank jyotish vigyaan kii padhai ke liye nae iaiti kii sthapana karenge
 If astrology is the number one science then there should be an IIT for astrology
 baad baaki sab thik he
 Our colleague Nidhi Vice Chancellor spoke to Nishank when he made this statement
 vigyaan kahata he ki bukamp kii bhavishyavaanee nahin kii ja sakati he magar nishank nidhi se kehete rahe ki jyotish se bukamp kii bhavishyavaanee ho sakati he
 India needs a scientifically minded human resource minister like Nishank
 ramesh pokharaliyaal nishank bharat ke maanav sansaadhan mantri hai
 If he is right, then the Chief of National Disaster Management should make an astrology so that earthquakes and hurricanes are known beforehand and rescue work can begin

 dilli-ensiaar ke sarkari or privet skulon main laaparvaahee ke kai maamle saamne aane ke baavjood skool prashasan sabak lene ko taiyaar nahin hai
 a very surprising case has come to light at the Government Sarvodaya Children's School in Kondli, East Delhi
 8veen kaksha main padhane vaale ek bachche ke gharavaalon ne aarope lagaaya he ki skool main unke bachche kaa haath tutaa or skool prashasan ne police main shikaayat na karne kaa dawaab banaaya
 The administration threatened to end the admission of the child for not doing so
 darasal yah puraa maamla tab saamne aayaa jab dipti siemmanish sisodiyashanivaar ko purvi dilli ke kondli main skool ke nae classroom kaa udghaatan karne pahunche the
 When Sisodia asked the parents of the children present in front of the stage to tell them about the school, a woman came in front and heard the tragedy
 dilli sarkaar ke rajkeey sarvoday bal vidhyalay main insaaf ke liye pichley kai dinon se chakkar kaat rahi aarti ne bataaya ki wo ek vidhwaa hai, or gharon main jhaadoo-poncha lagaakar rupee kamaati hai
 Last month, when she returned home after completing work, at 6 pm, she was called by the school's assistant manager Naresh and asked to come to school
 baar-baar poochne par bhi aarti ko jaankaree nahin di gai or yah kehete hue skool aane ke liye kaha gaya ki unke bete kii haalat gambhir he
 Aarti told that when she reached school, her son was lying on the bench and all his clothes were wet
 kaaphi der guzar jane ke baad bhi skool ne ilaaj kii koi karrwai nahin kii
 According to Aarti, when she reached school, the injured child was asked to go to Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital
 kaaphi der baad acitent manager ne unke bachche ko laal bahadur aspataal main choda or chale gaye
 Aarti told that her son and he returned home crying at 8:30 pm from the hospital
 aarti kaa aarope he ki skool ke andar bachche ko lagi chot kii jaankaree kisi ko na bataane or police main shikaayat na karne par skool prashasan ne naukari dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 Aarti alleges that he is being threatened that if he calls here and there, he will cut the son's TC and give it to him and there will be no admission in any school
 mahila kii shikaayat sunakar khud dipti siem manish sisodiya bhi hairaan rah gaye
 The woman also kept complaining standing in front of Sisodia for a long time
 sisodiya ne adhikariyon ko manch par bulaayaa or jaankaree lee
 During this time, Sisdia told the officers, 'please report what happened and how it happened
 ' sisodiya ne adhikariyon kii taraf dekhte hue kaha ki ainda aisi laaparvaahee nahin honi chahie
 Aarti claims that the school administration had given him a guard job as promised
 lekin ek shikaayat patr main aarti ne likhaa ki 11 sitambar 2017 ko assistant manager naresh ne unhen yah kahkar naukari se nikaal diya ki agar tum naukari nahin chhodogi to chori kaa iljaam laga diya jayega
 At present, even though the deputy CM has asked the authorities to report on the entire matter, Aarti is worried that her child is in danger of safety at school
 hindi film industry ke mashhoor plabac singer mukesh kaa aaj 91waan janmdin he
 He was born on 22 July 1923 in Delhi
 mukesh ko gayikee kaa shauk bachapan se hi tha
 When the master used to come home to teach music to his younger sister, Mukesh used to sit and learn tricks
 1941 main unhen pehla brake mila
 He sang the song 'dil Hi Bujha Hua Ho To' for the film 'innocence'
 yah unke kariyar kaa pehla gaanaa tha
 Mukesh loved KL Sehgal very much
 kariyar ke shuruaati dinon main mukesh kii gayikee main sahagal sahab kii chhap saaf mahasoos hoti thi
 In the film 'pahli Nazar' in 1945, Mukesh sang the song 'dil jalata hai to jalne do'
 kaha jaataa he ki jab sahagal ne is gane ko suna to vah is soch main pad gaye ki unhone yah gaanaa kab gaaya tha
 Mukesh tried to copy Sehgal Sahab to a large extent in this song
 sangeetkaar naushaad ali ne mukesh ko apni alag pahchaan kaayam karne main madad kii
 In 1974, Mukesh received the National Award for Best Playback Singer for the song 'kuch Baar Yun Hi Dekha Hai'
 apane gayikee ke kariyar main mukesh ne kareeb 13 sau gane gaye
 From the data point of view, it was quite low
 us daur ke gayakon ne isse zyada gane gaye the
 Mukesh, who focused on quality more than quality, went through many beautiful songs in his career
 'sab kuch siikhaa hamane', 'kabhi kabhi mere dil main', 'jai bolo beyimaan kii', 'duniya banane vaale' gane aaj bhi logon kii jubaan par he
 You may have missed your favorite song in this list
 kya karen, mukesh ke behtareen nagamon kii list he hi itani badi ki unhen samet paanaa aasaan nahin
 Our salute to Mukesh on his 91st birthday

 yah kahani betia ke atirikt police adheekshak rajesh kumaar ko badi ajeebogareeb maaloom hui, haalanki jaankaree dene vaala bharosemand tha
 a man from Jhakra village, just 25 km from his office, had built an extra septic tank in his house to fill the illegally purchased liquor in it
 rajesh dal-bal ke saath chapa maarane pahunch gaye
 There they found a small toilet tank mounted on top of a tank
 alabatta uski bagal main lage booster pump ne asli makasad kii kalai khol di
 The police drove the same pump and extracted liquor from the underground tank
 yah 12,000 litre kaa jakhira tha, jo maheene bhar tak jile ke sharaabiyon kii talab bujhane ke liye kaaphi tha
 Illegal "india-made foreign liquor" (IMFL) kept in a pitcher was also hit by the raiding squad
 magar sharaab rakhane ke liye bhumigat tahkhaana banavaane vaala aadmi indrashan saah bhaag nikalne main kaamyaab rahaa
 The raid hit on March 3, about three weeks before the ban on the sale of country liquor in Bihar from April 1
 lekin isse in ashankaon kii tasdik ho gai ki jahaan prashasan nashaabandi lagu karne ke liye qamar kas rahaa tha, vahiin avaidh sharaab ke taskar bhi motaa munafa kamaane kii taiyaari main jute the
 Subsequent raids throughout the state cemented it further
 asal main jhakaraa kii tarah bihar ke kai gaanv bhugolic taur par or duusare lihaaj se bhi nepal ke najadik hai
 Their way of life is marked by Nepal, except in Patna where decisions are taken as to what they should drink and what not to drink
 mukhyamantri kii baribihar main aanshik sharabbandi haalanki 1 april se lagu kii gai thi
 There was a ban on sale and consumption of domestic liquor only, while IMFL and premium foreign liquor businesses were exempted from government outlets
 lekin chaar dinon ke andar nitish kumaar ne teji se gear badla or 5 april se sampurna sharabbandi kaa farmaan suna diya
 The chief minister, who came out after the cabinet meeting on Tuesday, said, “initially we had thought of implementing liquor ban phase-wise in Bihar
 lekin aanshik sharabbandi ke chaar dinon ke bheetar hi ise aisa jabardast samarthan mila ki hamane tatkaal prabhaav se purna sharabbandi lagu karne kaa faisla kiya he
 According to a senior leader of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), which is running a coalition government with Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal (united), the government suddenly had to change its decision because "it was a little late to realize that only foreign liquor By allowing the sale of the same, it will only create a false notion of being a supporter of the rich
 ” sampurna sharabbandi se mukhyamantri kii izzat or shoharat main ijapha hoga, vahiin aabkaari vibhaag bhi desi sharaab par pabandi lagu karte hue iemfel kii bikri kaa hisaab-kitaab rakhane se batch jayega
 How did this happen? It was July 9 before the 2015 assembly elections
 us din nitish kumaar ne pehali baar sharabbandi kaa vaada kiya tha
 Although his image is that of a man who worked hard and planned, but he made this promise in a jolt without any preparation
 asal main rajya sarkaar or antarrashtriya vikaas vibhaag ke ek sanyukt aayojan main shrotaaon main baithi kuch auraton ne sharaab par pabandi lagane kii maang kii thi
 In the noise, this demand was not heard by Nitish
 magar jab unhone apni bagal main baithe mantrimandal ke saathi se baat kii, tab ve dobaaraa mike par aae or vaada kiya ki agar phir satta main laute to sharabbandi lagu karenge
 The irony that bites the ears is that it was Nitish Kumar's government that was credited with reviving the liquor business in Bihar in the past
 2005 main jedy(you)-bijepi gathbandhan kii sarkaar ke mukhiya ke taur par nitish ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad rajya sarkaar ne aabkaari niti main badlaav kiya tha
 And it was also Nitish's government, which formed the Bihar State Beverage Corporation Limited in 2006 and made it mandatory for all liquor manufacturers to sell liquor through it
 iske baad hi bihar sarkaar sharaab kii dukaanon kaa or zyada aavanton karne lagi thi or rajasav main ijaphe ke liye usne license fees badhaani bhi shuru kar di thi
 Bihar's excise revenue was Rs
 525 crore in 2007-08 on account of sale of Rokra Barsati liquor, liquor and IMFL
 se badhkar 2015-16 main 4,001 karod ru
 reached at
 is saat guna badhotaree ne aabkaari shulk ko rajya ke khajaane ko bharne vaala sabase teji se badhata hissaa bana diya
 Nitish needed this money for his popular welfare schemes like giving bicycles to school girls
 yah vah yojana thi, jisane unhen tarif or vot dilwaaye
 It was a bit like a Robinhood act, in which the government was returning the amount collected in taxes from liquor lovers to the common people in the form of social welfare schemes
 asal main 2015-16 main rajya ke 30,875 karod ru
 12 in total revenue of Rs
 95 fisadi yogadan aabkaari shulk kaa tha
 2,159 crores from desi liquor alone
 kaa aabkaari shulk vasula gaya tha
 If we add sales tax collection to it, then it seems that the government has got about 5,027 crores from the prohibition of liquor
 kii chapat lagegi, jo kul rajasav kaa 16 fisadi se bhi zyada he
 Despite this, Nitish is ready to bear the brunt of the treasure
 nae disha-nirdeshon ne bihar kii sabhi 5,446 panjikrut nijee sharaab dukaanon ko taala daalane ke liye majaboor kar diya he
 These include 2,471 shops engaged in the business of country liquor
 iske alaava ab ve 650 sarkari dukaane bhi nahin khulengi, jinhen sarkaar ne alag se iemfel kii bikri kaa jimmaa saunpa tha
 Nitish's decision to ban all liquor has blunted bjp's accusation of "different behavior regarding different types of liquor", but his challenge has increased
 30 march ko vidhansabha main bolte hue nitish ne apni nai aabkaari niti main sakht sajaa or “inasaaniyat” kaa zikr kiya
 It has been said to provide compensation to the families of those who died due to illicit liquor and help to those who are drunk
 sabase badi chunautipichley hi maheene bihar ne 101 saal ke baad apane aabkaari niyamon main bhi sanshodhan kiya
 It has added strict fines and punishments for violating the prohibition laws, including punishment-a-death for illegal liquor manufacturers causing deaths
 magar jab tak inhen lagu karne vaali asardaar mashinari na ho, tab tak aisi sajaa sachmuch logon ko daraa paaegi, isaki sambhaavna kam hi he
 The biggest challenge for Nitish, however, is that this restriction has to be implemented by him in the same system, which has hardly stood before such a big challenge
 bihar police par bahut zyada nirbharta hi sabase badi kamajori banakar saamne aa sakati he, jo aam aparaadhon kii rokthaam main bhi buree tarah naakaam rahi he
 Worse, even when the sale and consumption of country liquor was not legally prohibited in Bihar, there have been terrible tragedies due to illegal and poisonous liquor
 2012 main jahrili sharaab se judi silsilewar ghatnaon main bihar main 26 se zyada logon ne apni jaan ganvaai thi
 As far as enforcing the ban is concerned, it is a matter of fact before the authorities that 22 out of 38 districts of Bihar are bordering Nepal, UP, Jharkhand and West Bengal where there is no ban on liquor
 bharat or nepal ke bich 1,800 kimi lambii or khuli sarhad par ise lagu karnaa khaasaa mushkil hoga, jahaan aane-jane ke anginat khule raste hai
 From electronics to drugs and alcohol, from guns to fake currency — and in recent times even to terrorists — it has been entering from this frontier
 sharabbandi taskaron ke liye ishwar ke vardaan se kam nahin he
 In such a situation, expecting the Bihar Police to block it, even with the active cooperation of the Border Armed Forces, will have to cook the famous casserole
 hakeekat yah he ki nashaabandi desh bhar main aam taur par naakaam rahi he or isaki vajah he bhrasht afasaron, police, taskaron or avaidh sharaab ke kaarobaariyon kii santhganth, jinhone aapas main haath milakar vyavastha ko taak par dhar diya he
 Restrictions on domestic liquor can also cause deep concerns about health, as a large number of drinkers now use palm juice as an alternative (though its sales are banned) and other less monitored Desi may turn to liquor and toddy
 haalanki sarkaar ne tadi kii saarvajanik bikri par bhi pratibandh laga diya he
 The current phase of prohibition in prohibition in Bihar was the second encounter of prohibition with prohibition
 pehali baar 1976 se 1979 ke bich divangat samaajawaadee mukhyamantri karpuri thakur ke kaarykaal main pabandi lagi thi
 Ram Sundar Das, who became the chief minister after him, quickly withdrew the decision
 us vakt sharabbandi vaanchit asar daalane main naakaam rahi thi kyonki prashasan iske liye taiyaar nahin tha
