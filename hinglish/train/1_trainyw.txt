 in / Deepak Nayak of Rajasthan is a software engineer by profession
 lekin ek ejeeniyar hote hue strawberry kii kheti karke kisaanon ke liye tarakkee ke naye daravaaje khol rahe hai
 Deepak wants to do something different in life, so he decided to leave engineering and do farming
 unhone apni pushtaini jameen par strawberry kii kheti karnaa shuru kiya
 The school opened in the house and then the whole village was given education in the free! Deeply thinking Deepak did not want to cultivate the crop which was used by the people of his or nearby village
 iske liye unhone apane america main rahane vaale dost se salaah lee
 On the advice of a friend, Deepak decided to cultivate strawberries
 iske liye unke dost ne kuch upaay bataae saath hi utyub par video dekhakar kheti kerani shuru kii
 Temperature should be between 10 to 30 degrees
 For strawberry cultivation, the temperature should be between 10 and 30 degrees Celsius
 jiske liye unhone kheti sardiyon main kheti karne kaa faisla kiya
 According to a website, Deepak told that about 24000 saplings can be planted on one acre of land
 unhone bataaya ki do kataron ke bich kii duuri shuruyaat main 10 se 12 inch tak honi chahie
 This is how strawberries are marketed
 They have good demand for strawberries in Bilawar and Ajmer associated with the village of Deepak
 aisa isliye kyonki aas-paas ke ilaakon main isaki kheti hi nahin ho rahi he
 Deepak sells strawberries at the rate of Rs 200 per kg
 vah sidhe graahakon ko apni fasal bechate hai
 These 'grandmothers' live in a hut, know why PM Modi's praise of strawberry cannot be stored for long
 vahiin maharashtra main ugane vaali strawberry ko pehle ahmedabad laayaa jaataa he or phir aas-paas ke bazaaron tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 This entire process takes up to a week and due to this, customers cannot get fresh strawberries
 isi ke saath deepak ko is baat kii khushi he ki vah graahakon ko taaji strawberry uplabdh kara rahe hai

 In Uttar Pradesh's Keshamali district, a case has been reported of meeting her with a female courier
 jahaan ek shaks ne bas kaa intjaar kar rahi mahila ko pehle lift di or phir uske saath balaatkaar kiya
 This incident of rape is from Yunuspur village in Shamli
 ek sthaneey police adhikari ne is sambandh main jaankaree dete hue bataaya ki buudhvaar kii shaam ek vivahitamahilabus stop par khadey hokar bas kaa itanjar kar rahi thi
 Then a young man named Vishwa Kumar reached there on a bike and asked to leave the woman to her village
 mahila uski baat maanakar uski bike par baith gai
 After some time, the accused stopped the bike on the side of the fields
 or mahila ko jabarnakhetamen le jaakar uske saath balaatkaar kiya
 Munesh Kumar, SHO of Pukhta Garhi Police Station, said that after the incident, the woman somehow reached her home and heard her family members
 tab ve mahila ko lekar thane pahunche
 The police registered a case against the victim's husband Tahrir
 baad main police ne dabish dekararopvishwa kumaar ko giraftaar kar liya
 The police sent the woman home after getting her medical
 aaropee se police poochtacha bhi kar chuki he
 The accused is from the same village

 You will have to go to the theater to learn about the story ahead
 is film kii khami isaki script he, jo ki mudde se idhar-udhar bhatakati he or saath hi iskaa screenple jo film ko lambaa karata he
 The film has been spread in 2 hours to create moments for the short story
 di-focus karke film ko thodaa ubaau kar dete hai
 Apart from this, we have seen films like 'toilet- Ek Prem Katha' and 'milda' on the same issue, so the novelty of the subject is not the same
 film kii ek or badi khami ye he ki kahani kaa marm aap kai jagah mahasoos nahin karte or saath main kai kirdaaron kaa bhi
 Despite that we have seen a hundred films on this subject, yet the biggest feature of this film is its subject, because Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra took up this subject as a filmmaker while realizing his responsibility
 iske alaava duusari khubi he anjali patil or om kannaujia kii adaakaari
 Apart from this, the songs of the film looked good whether it was his music or writing
 vahiin main tarif karnaa chaahunga film kii cinemetography kii, jo film ko isaki duniya ke kareeb rakhti he

 Kapil Mishra said that Delhi's hospitals do not have beds, there is no water in Delhi's houses, mlas do not meet the public
 aise main arvind kejariwal hindu-muslim karke apane vidhayakon kii kami ko chupa rahe hai
 Kapil Mishra said that Arvind Kejriwal made a poisonous speech in front of the children on 26 January and now put a picture of Tipu Sultan

 bagga ne kaha ki kejariwal bhai matidas, bandaabahadur ko bhul rahe hai or lakhon hinduon kaa jabaran dharm badalawaane vaale tipu sultan ko tarjeeh de rahe hai
 Bagga announced that if Kejriwal does not get this picture removed from the Delhi Assembly, he will take this picture himself, taking care of public sentiment
 bataa den kiarvind kejarivalsarkaar ne 26 janvari ko dilli vidhansabha main tipu sultan kii tasviir lagaai he
 Apparently after the picture of Tipu Sultan was installed in the Delhi Assembly, a political uproar has started
 vipakshi dalon ne ab is mudde par aam aadmi party par nishaanaa sadhana shuru kar diya he
 Significantly, BJP MLA OP Sharma had said that putting the portrait of Tipu Sultan in the assembly was hurtful to the sentiments of the people
 opi sharma ne kaha, 'jabakejarivalko pataa he ki ye vivaadit he to kyon tasviir lagaai gai
 Bhagat Singh does not have the stature to be associated with Rani Laxmibai
 main ye maamla vidhansabha main bhi uthaaungaa
 ' upi aties ne turant isaki jaankaree dilli police kii special cell ko di

 Police seized CCTV footage of the hotel and the identity cards of both the suspects
 suraksha agenciyon ke mutabik abhi yah saaf nahin he ki ye log kisi aatanki gatividhi se jude hai
 No offensive goods or weapons have been recovered from Bilal
 lekin dilli or kai rajyon main inaki sargarmi se talash kii ja rahi he
 Kashmir police has also been informed about this
 police ne hotel kaa sisitivi footage or donon sandidhon ke pahchaan patr jabt kar liye hai
 According to the security agencies, it is not clear that these people are associated with any terrorist activity
 bilal ke paas se koi aapattijanak saamaan yaa hathiyaar bhi baraamad nahin hua he
 But in Delhi and many states, they are being searched enthusiastically
 kashmir police ko bhi isaki jaankaree de di gai he

 pyaar ek bahut hi khubasurat ehsaas he
 When two people are in love, they also find their life beautiful
 saath hi pyaar main duube log jab pehali baar ek duusare ko choote hai to wo ehsaas hi bahut alag hota he, jise shabdon main bayaan nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Let's know, how do two loving people feel when they hold each other's hands for the first time
 1
 When two lovers hold each other's hands, it is clear that your partner is quite serious about you
 aapke partner ke dil main aapke liye ek khaas jagah he
 Which no one can erase
 in vajahon ke kaaran mahilaon main badhata ja rahaa he single rahane kaa trend2
 If your partner crosses your hand, it means that he is very caring about you
 aapako khush karne ke liye wo apni khushiyon ko bhi daanv par laga saktaa he
 3
 jab koi kapal bheed-bhaad main bhi ek duusare kaa haath kasakar pakadta he to, isse ye pataa chalata he ki wo jeevanabhar apane saathi kaa haath aise hi thame rahanaa chaahate hai or ve saarvajanik rup se bhi apane pyaar ko jaahir karne se hichakate nahin hai
 Do you not say these things to your partner while quarreling? 4
 agar aapkaa koi dost kisi naa kisi bahaane se aapkaa haath pakadaney kii koshish karata he to samaj jaaen ki us shaks ke dil main aapke liye dosti kii bhaavana pyaar kaa rup lene lagi he or wo aapako dost se kahin badhkar samajhane laga he
 5
 jab koi sirf ungaliyon kii madad se hi aapkaa haath pakadta he to iskaa yahi matlab he ki wo shaks aapako lekar kaaphi cajual he
 By holding your partner's hand, you can find out the feelings hidden in their heart for you

 co / agfpoyx4gf25 may ko madhya pradesh ke siwani main goraksha ke naam par gundgardee kaa kathith video saamne aayaa tha
 In this video, the alleged guards are seen beating and capturing three people, including a woman

 acchhee sehat ke liye sharir ko protein, vitamin, kabrehydrate se lekar tamaam tarah ke poshak padaatharen kii jarurat hoti he, lekin sawaal uthta he ki yah sab mili kahaan se
 The answer is cheese
 yani chiz, jisamen protein, vitamin, carbohydrate, vasa sab kuch hota he or vah bhi bharpoor
 Dietician Sheila Sehrawat says, 'milk and its dishes come first as a nutritious food when it comes to health
 doodh se milane vaale padaarthon main malai, rabadi, dahi, khoyaa, makkhan jaise paramparaagat bhartiya utpaadon ke saath hi videshon se bharat aae ‘chiz’ kii lokapriyata main bhi khaasaa ijapha ho rahaa he
 It contains plenty of protein, vitamins, carbohydrates, fat, calcium, phosphorus etc
 ’’ paneer ke is paushtik gun kii vajah se hi kuch pashchimi deshon main 20 janvari ko ‘chiz de’ manaaya jaataa he
 There is no such day trend in India
 saharaavat kahati hai ki sehat ke maamle main chiz butter se zyada phydemand hoti he
 People with obesity can also consume a balanced amount of cheese, while they are advised to avoid other fatty foods altogether
 ek anya aahaar visheshgy gopa mohanti bataati hai ki chiz yani paneer doodh ke protein or vasa se banataa he
 If children are reluctant to drink milk, they can also be given cheese-fed food, through which adequate amounts of protein can be delivered to their body
 garbhvatee mahilaon ke liye bhi paneer uttam aahaar he
 Cheeses or paneer used to be part of only the upper class food in India till some time ago, but for some time it has also made its way into middle class cuisine
 visheshgy iskaa shrey cheez ke swasthya ke liye anukool gunon or lajij swaad ko dete hai
 Statue Farukhi, who runs a cookery class in Delhi, says, "cheese has a special place in most European cuisines
 paneer ke poshak gunon se waakif log iske seven se utana parhez nahin karte, jitna butter or anya taileey padaarthon se karte hai
 During the intake of cheese, they are comforted that the amount of fat in their food is not very high
 ’’farukhi bataati hai ki unhone kai vyanjanon main paneer kaa sammishran karke unhen aadhunik rup diya or unka yah prayog logon ne kaaphi pasand bhi kiya
 Now people are using these same experiments in their daily food, making their taste very delicious with 'cheese'
 farukhi ne bataaya ki unhone dosa or pilav jaise paramparaagat bhartiya bhojan main bhi iske upyog sambandhi prayog karne shuru kar die hai
 There is no concrete evidence available about the place of origin of cheese originally included in Western countries' cuisine
 aisa mana jaataa he ki paneer ke swaad se sabase pehle europe, madhya asia yaa madhya purv ke desh parichit hue, jiske baad yah vishwa ke kone kone main fail gaya
 Cheese in India is used in foreign cuisine, especially pizza, toast, pasta and sandwiches
 bharat main paneer kii sabji har ghar main chaav se khai jaati he
 Pea Paneer and Spinach Paneer are included in the menu of every big and small restaurant and its stuffed paranthas and bhujia are also liked

 The incident took place when the engineer was going with his friend Gagan in his Fortuner car

 The first bullet broke the windshield of the Fortuner, and the 27-year-old software engineer Ankit Chauhanki, sitting on the driving seat of the vehicle, smashed the front glass
 hairat kii baat yah he ki usee car main savaar ejeeniyar ke dost ko kaatilon ne baksh diya
 The three who shot the three and shot only very close to the target of the engineer only
 uske dost ko kharonch tak nahin ai
 Seeing his friend being shot like this, Gagan's hands and feet swelled up
 uski samaj main kuch nahin aayaa ki kya kare
 Gagan did not even know how to drive a car
 thodi hi der main maukey par jamaa logon kii madad se usne ankit ko driving seat se hataaya or use paas ke shivalik aspataal main lekar gaya lekin vahaan uski gambhir haalat bataai jane par log ankit ko kailash aspataal le gayi
 There the doctor declared him dead

 In a city like Noida, the murderer has shaken 15 km in film style in a film style car chase and shot and killed him
 baad main pataa chalaa ki jis ecord car main kaatil savaar the uskaa number farji tha
 From this, it can be guessed that the murderer had come up with complete planning in advance
 lekin katl kii vajah kaa pataa nahin lag paaya he
 According to the police, if Ankit, who works in Tata Consultancy Services i
e
 TCS, had a holiday on Monday
 vah apane dost gagan ke saath apni bivi amisha chouhan se milane uske daftar sector-135 gaya tha
 Ankit's wife Amisha is also an engineer by profession and she works in a company called Ascenture
 ankit or gagan amisha ke saath lunch karke waapas laut rahe the
 After all, who could be the killer of Ankit and what could be the reason for this murder? If sources are to be believed, the Noida Police is currently investigating three cases for the cause
 pehali vajah ranjish, duusari vajah maheene bhar pehle hui ankit kii shaadi
 While the third reason Ankit has become a victim of Miss Identification
 is maamle kii jaanch kar rahi police kaa dhyaan philhal marane vaale kii kisi se puraani dushmani hone par hi he
 Is Ankit's murder string connected to Meerut, Muzaffarnagar or Bangalore? Actually Ankit was a resident of Meerut
 uske pita kaa vahaan property kaa acha-khaasaa kaam he
 While wife Amisha is a resident of Muzaffarnagar
 lekin donon kii jaan-pahchaan padhai ke dauraan bangaleru main hui thi
 Now the question is, who is the killer? june kii chilchilaati garmi ke baavjood dilli ke dinadayal upaadhyaay maarg sthit bhaajapa ke rashtriya mukhyalay main kaaphi sakriyata he

 The party believes that the index of opposition parties against the BJP is high only in Uttar Pradesh, where 80 mps of the Lok Sabha are elected
 party ke ek netaa kehete hai, "nishchit rup se upi hamaare liye chintaa kaa vishay he
 In the words of another leader, "in other states, opposition unity will work to create an emotional atmosphere in favor of Narendra Modi and the effect will be that the people will unite against those who want to overthrow an honest Prime Minister

 But nothing like this will happen
 upi main sapa-basapa kii chunauti se nibatane ke liye hamane 50 fisadi vot paane kaa lakshya rakhaa he or isamen ham mahaj chah fisadi se peeche hai

 The party also believes that there will be something else at the national level where the competition will be Modi vs Rahul or Modi vs others
 jaisaa ki amit shah kehete hai, "vipakshi ekta aisi ghatana he jise media badha-chadhaakar dikhaa rahaa he

 The BJP feels that if a major reshuffle is done at the state or national level at this time, the party's performance will not be better than that, it can be bad
 isi kaaran shah rashtriya str par rajnath kii puraani team se hi kaam chalaa rahe hai, unhone isamen bas kuch chehre jode hai
 Many in the party believe that Amit Shah should have built his team in a complete manner and that his status quoist could prove to be dangerous
 amit shah ke kareebi sutron kaa kahana he ki unke saamne vikalp nahin he

 vahiin kaaryakartaaon kaa ek dhada yogi ke afasarshahi par jarurat se zyada bharosa karne se naaraaz he
 Apart from this, the three major party leaders of UP - Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Maurya, State Organization Secretary Sunil Bansal and State BJP Chief Mahendra Nath Pandey - have not been able to keep pace with Yogi for various reasons
 iske saath hi yogi kii prashaskeey kshamta bhi sawaalon ke ghere main he

 eshez series main 2−0 se aage chal rahi england team ke hausale is kadar buland ho gaye hai ki unke gendbaaz stuard broad ab team ko lekar world champion jaise khwab dekhne lage hai
 Broad said he wanted people to fear England the same way people feared Australia in the 90s
 haalanki, stuart broad kii tamanna or haqikat main abhi bada faaslaa nazar aata he kyonki isisi test ranking main england 112 ankon ke saath tisare number par he jabaki bharat 116 ankon ke saath duusare or da

 broad ne kaha ki vah chaahate hai ki log england se bhi vaise hi daren jaise log 90 ke dashak main australia se darate the
 However, there is still a big gap between Stuart Broad's desire and reality as England are third in the ICC Test rankings with 112 points while India are second and 116 with 116 points
 africa 135 ankon ke saath pehle number par he

 For the first time, one person was appointed on every 50 voters who had the responsibility of taking out their respective voters to the booth
 khud pradhanmantri yahaan bhale hi prachaar karne nahin aaye hon lekin soobe ke mukhyamantri or mantri se lekar cabinet ke lagbhag sabhi mantri yahaan na sirf deraa daale rahe balki 10 se 20 logon tak kii nukkad sabhaayen or baithak kii
 The Election Commission also made every effort to increase the voting percentage
 samajasevi sansthaaon ke kaaryakramon ke alaava matdaan pratishat badhane ke liye model poling booth, pink booth, selfi point, bacchon ke liye matdaan centre par khel kud kii vyavastha tak kii gai, iske baavjood matdaan ke prati logon kii udaseenta dikhaai padi or yahaan ke matadaata first class paas nahin ho paye

 35 pratishat matdaan hua tha jabaki is baar 56
 The turnout was 97 percent

 Assembly wise, in Varanasi Lok Sabha four out of five assembly, BJP one and one is in possession of its party

 Second in the city northern assembly constituency where 54
 71 fisadi vot hua
 58 also in the city southern
 16 pratishat vot padaa jabaki ye wo vidhansabha hai jahaan bijepi ke sarvaadhik vot hai
 What are the reasons behind this low turnout and why pm's Kashi disappointed him
 is par pradhanmantri modi khud manthan to karenge hi lekin isaki samiksha bijepi ke bheetar ke saath hi banaras ke har gali chauraahey par ho rahi he
 People are looking at different ways
 pehali baat ye nikal kar aa rahi he ki 2014 main jab pradhanmantri yahaan chunaav ladane aaye to banaras main unka rajanithik jivan shunya tha
 At the same time, with his strong personality, he also assured people that he not only promises but also has the power to wear his promise as a veneer of truth
 janata ne un par tut kar bharosa kiya
 But in 2019, his political life turned five years in Benaras, in this five years he did many things, brought about a plan of 40 thousand crores, but whether this plan came on the ground or many of the schemes remained only on paper
 sadak bijli pani jam jaisi moolbhoot samasyon se jujhate banaras main sirf baahar kaa banaras to badla nazar aayaa lekin bheetar kaa banaras aaj bhi usee halaat main he
 Heart and Amrit Yojana was reduced to just a few roads and streets
 iske alaava jis vishwanath coridor yojana ko jameen par laane ke liye modi ne edi chotii kaa jor lagaaya us yojana se bhi kor bijepi ke kuch voter naraj hue or chunaav main udasin dikhaai pade
 In these five years, the fishermen society was also seen struggling for their livelihood on the plan of cruise and jetty in the Ganges
 vyapaaree varg bhi notebandi or jiesti se bahut khush nahin dikhaa jiskaa asar matdaan pratishat kii udaseenta main nazar aata he
 Apart from all this, it is also being said that there was no strong candidate standing against PM Modi, so there was no enthusiasm in the vote against him
 mahagathbandhan kii pratyaashee shalini yadav ko lekar unheen kii party ke ek kaddavar vidhayak ne unka virodh kar nota kaa prachaar shuru kar diya
 This time also there was disappointment among Dalits
 congress main bhi shuru main maahaul bana ki priyanka yahaan se chunaav ladengi lekin jab wo nahin ain to wo utsaah bhi thandha pad gaya
 This time, Muslim voters also did not turn out to vote with full enthusiasm due to Ramadan and not having any nominee candidates, in which the percentage of Muslim women was even lower
 ye wo kaaran hai jisase pradhanmantri ko record maton se vot paane kii ummid main niraashaa haath lagi lekin ye ho saktaa he ki is baar wo kam vot padane ke baavjood pichhali baar ke vot se zyaada maton se chunaav jeet jaaen
 Despite this, he will feel disappointed that there was no strong candidate against him, yet the record vote was not obtained

 According to the news, Delhi government of Arvind Kejriwal has hung the project of about 40 thousand crores of central government

 Priyanka tweeted and said, "TV is showing that BJP is trying to repeat the game of Karnataka by defying the (constitutional) institutions and constitution in Maharashtra
" ' congress netaa ne kaha, ‘maharashtra main 12000 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kar lee or unke liye bhaajapa sarkaar kii jeb se to madad nahin nikali
 Further, Priyanka Gandhi asked, "have we reached the stage of open kidnapping of the mandate?" TV is showing that the BJP is trying to repeat the game of Karnataka, defying the institutions and constitution in Maharashtra
 
 maharashtra main 12000 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kar lee
 For them, no help came out of the pocket of the BJP government

 yachika main kaha gaya ki puja kaa adhikaar sanvaidhanik adhikaar he, aise main mandir kaa punarnirmaan karaayaa jaae or dobaaraa bhagwaan ravidaas kii murti sthapit kii jaae

 Where a husband, in the greed for money, pushed his wife into the business of prostitution
 isse pehle aaropee pati ne khud ko begunaah sabit karne kii naakaam koshish bhi kii
 But the police uncovered the case
 motihaari kesaria ke gaajpur nivasee shivnath kii shaadi sevanivruth bankkarmi kii beti ke saath hui thi
 This was the second marriage of the woman
 mahila mangalvaar ko police ke paas pahunchi
 She told the police that she had escaped from the clutches of the miscreants
 jo ussedeh vyaparkara rahe the
 Her husband Shivnath bargained with the brokers
 mahila ne police ko bataaya ki tathakthith patrkaar manikant ne us mahila ko jissafaroshi kaa dhandha karne par majaboor kiya
 He was served from Patna to Ranchi and then to Bhagalpur in front of many people
 mahila kii aapbeetee sunakar police vaale bhi hairaan rah gaye
 And raided his spotter and arrested three people
 esaspi manoj kumaar ne bataaya ki bhagalpur ke sheetala sthaan daal mil road par ek kiraye ke makaan main deh vyapaar kaa dhandha karaayaa jaataa tha
 The house was raided based on the victim's statement
 vahaan se gunjan choube, santosh choube or tathakthith patrkaar manikant ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 It was then revealed that the woman's husband was also involved in the conspiracy
 police ne us maakan se aapattijanak saamaan baraamad kiya
 Besides, cash, liquor bottles, passbooks, pan cards etc
 have also been recovered
 police ke mutabik silaai centre chalaane ke naam par makaan kiraye par liya gaya tha
 a few months ago Shivnath went out of work
 is dauraan uskaa ek parichit beeti 28 july ke din uski patni ko bazaar ghumaane ke bahaane postal park sthit sanjay ke ghar le gaya
 Where Sony, Sanjay and Manikant alias Dhanno were already present
 vahaan uske saath jabarnabalaatkaarakia gaya tha
 She is scared that her husband has been caught by the police in a murder case and the police is also searching for her
 basii isi baat dar dikhaakar use blackmel kiya jaataa rahaa
 But on Tuesday she somehow ran to the police and the gang was revealed
 esaspi manoj kumaar ne bataaya ki peedit mahila ko patna se ranchi sthit rajnikant pandeya ke ghar le jaaya gaya tha
 He was also physically abused there
 uske baad manikant ne peedit mahila ko bhagalpur meerajanhaat sthit sheetala sthaan daal mil road par ek mahila ke haathon bech diya tha
 Only then the body trade was being forced on him
 pichley saal kii aakhri raat ko ek pakistani boat main hue visphot ke maamle main raksha mantralay ne coast guard ke diaiji bike loshaali ke khilaaf vibhageeya jaanch ke aadesh de die hai
 The investigation will find out how much truth lies in the statement of Laushali, in which he claimed that he had ordered the boat to fly, according to a video released by the English daily Indian Express
 udhar, raksha mantralay loshaali maamle main ab yah kah rahi he kii loshaali western cmand ke ek chif of staff the or unke kaam kaa dayera sirf prashasnic tha or "unka kaam kisi lihaaz se kisi bhi oparation se nahin joda ja saktaa, isiilie 31 disambar kii raat ko jo hua, uski unhen kuch khabar nahin ho sakati
 " raksha mantralay ke ek adhikaari main enditivi india ko bataaya us adhikari ke mutabik jo bhi oparations coast guard main hoti he, uski disha commander in chif yani ek aiji rank kaa afasar tay karata he
 Not only this, now the Ministry of Defense is also saying that Laushali's service record is not correct, that is why it has been posted in Gujarat and on such post which is not sensitive in any way
 vaise yah maamla ab tool pakad chukaa he, kyonki is par safai khud raksha mantri ko deni pad rahi he
 According to the Defense Minister, the government will put forward some more evidence, which will make it clear that the operation was followed by a properly level operating procedure
 raksha mantralay ke dwaara jari kiye gaye bayaan main kaha gaya he ki boat par chaar aadmi the or vah lagaataar di ja rahi chetavaniyon ko nazarandaaz kar rahe the
 After some time, the people on the boat set the boat on fire
 sabhi intelligence reports isaki tasdik bhi karti hai
 In fact, according to the news published in the Indian Express on Wednesday and a video released later, at an event in Surat on Monday, the Coast Guard DIG openly said that a suspicious Pakistani boat was flown on the night of 31 December, And the people sitting in it did not blast themselves, as the Coast Guard and Indian Ministry of Defense have been claiming till now
 video ke mutabik diaiji ne kaha tha, "aap logon ko 31 disambar yaad he, jab hamane pakistani boat uda di thi
 
 
 i was in Gandhi Nagar
 
 
 maine raat ko kaha tha, uda do boat ko
 
 
 We do not want to feed them biryani
 
 
 " On the news of this news, DIG Laushali immediately realized the seriousness of his statement and several officers of the Coast Guard including DIG gave a press conference and clarified the matter
 loshaali ne bayaan ko media ke naam madhne kii koshish kii kaha ki unhone aisa koi bayaan nahin diya, sirf yah kaha tha ki rashtravirohi tatwon ko biryani khilaane kii zarurat nahin he
 Laushali also said that he was not handling that operation, so he was not aware of that operation given the secrecy of that operation
 unhone kaha ki nauka ne khud ko aag lagaai thi or coast guard ne use nahin duboya tha
 But this controversy has again raised the question as to what was the truth of the night of 31 December 2014, because till now the information related to that boat has not been made common by the government, although the boat itself was blown away
 Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar, who is claiming to be, still maintains his point, and said, "the government will present evidence in the case of Pakistani boats, and it is firm on its statement earlier
" unhone yah bhi kaha ki agar koi channel kuch alag kahata he to ham uski jaanch karenge
 He said, we have 15-16 lakh army personnel, if any one officer makes a wrong statement, i will investigate it and then take action

 How can we forget Gulab Singh Kirar, who is accused in a business affair with his son
 madhya pradesh ke pichhadaa ayog ke sarvesarva the
 He used to attend Kirar conference with Chief Minister Shivraj Chauhan
 ab bataaiye kaise koi yakeen na kare ki mukhyamantri kaa sammaan gulab singh kiraar se judaa tha isaliye to wo bachaa hua tha? The entire system of the state still considers the Sudhir Sharma who embraced him from the party to the top
 sudhir sharma kaa sammaan kam na ho jaae isaliye shaayad rajya kii bijepi ne unhen ab tak party se nikaala nahin
 Then what is the honor and what self-respect, the Chief Minister of the state? namrata damor kii maut ko rajya kii police saamaanya maut bataati rahi, aisa kya badal gaya raaton raat ki sibiai ai to usne dfa 302 main ye cese darj kar liya? sattadhariyon ko ab rajya ke sammaan kaa khyaal kyon nahin aayaa?tippaniyan Taking any press conference, you will understand how Chief Minister Shivraj did not see himself moving forward during the Vyapam case
 pehle kehete rahe congress bhi aisa karti rahi he 
 
 
 So who are they to question us? Then he kept saying that he wanted to get justice, so file a case
 
 
 phir wo visil blor ho gaye
 
 phir wo apni kirakiri ko rajya ke sammaan se jodne lage
 Why are the Chief Ministers of the State not telling us that who will bring back the respect of the students who studied diligently, whose tests went well and were hoping that a job would be necessary? Who would tell that son and daughter were smart, but the system was clever, which killed their talent and honor
 agali baar jab sammaan or swabhimaan kii baat ho to zaraa sochiyegaa ki yatraaon ke shaukeen mukhyamantri kiski baat kar rahe hai

 The police of the state kept calling Namrata Damore's death a normal death, what changed so that the CBI came overnight and registered this case in 302? Why did the authorities no longer care about the honor of the state? Comments aap koi bhi press conference uthaakar dekh lijie samaj aa jayega ki kaise mukhyamantri shivaraj khud ke vajood se aage badhate nahin dikhe vyaapman cese ke dauraan

 After 23 years, when two rival hugged, a big incident should have taken place and Majma should have gathered, but nothing happened
 do bade lekin post netaaon ke sur milane ke baad bhi janata ne unki sud nahin lee
 The meeting between JD (U) supremo Nitish Kumar and RJD boss Lalu Yadav could not give any message other than the media event
 unka yah bahuprachaarit sho flop rahaa
 Actually, the same happens to those who are unable to read the writings written on the walls
 nitish babu sushasan purush ke rup main maane gaye the jinhone danke kii chot par bihar ke kushasan ko khatm karne kaa aahvaan kiya tha or safal bhi hue the
 This was his biggest capital in politics which he lost in Subhai Jamalpur village of Hajipur
 yah dekhte hue ki unki party satta main he, is sho main maatr kuch 'sau' logon kaa aana unke liye ek bhayanak duswapn kii tarah rahaa hoga
 He must have hoped that this gathering would be very crowded and people would come to see him with his former friend Lalu Yadav
 lekin yah sapana hi rah gaya
 The special thing about the satraps of Indian politics is that they do politics on the basis of their wishes and aspirations
 unke liye kisi or kii raay yaa loktantric vichaar koi myne nahin rakhte
 They have an army of supporters over whom they rule and keep up their wishes
 jaahir he, nitish kumaar koi apwaad nahin hai
 They go on believing that whatever they do will be valid for their supporters but this time they are defeated
 jedy(you) ke kaaryakartaaon ne lalu prasad kii party ko parrast karne ke liye puri mehnat kii, din-raat ek kiya or sabase badi baat yah rahi ki unhone apane-apane ilaakon main apni party kii saakh jamaai
 But now Nitish Kumar wants him to change his actions because he does not like Narendra Modi
 unki yah ghor naapsandgi party ko rasaatal main le ja rahi he
 His workers are not ready to accept his Tughlaqi decree and he got an example of this on Monday
 haalanki unhone sabhasthal main hameshaa kii tarah bijepi ke khilaaf jehar ugala lekin unhen vah rispons nahin mila jisaki unhen ummid thi
 He and his new friend, who are calling him a younger brother, thought that the purpose of this so-called grand alliance is only to blow the BJP away
 nitish kumaar bihar kii gaddi isliye mili thi ki unhone narkiy jivan ji rahe karodon bihariyon main aashaa kii ek kiran jagaai thi or baad main unhen ek behatar jindagi bhi dilaai
 But now he is compromising with the same forces that are responsible for the plight of that state
 yah baat kisi ke gale nahin utar paa rahi he
 Lalu Yadav is happy
 unhen phir se bihar kii gaddi dikh rahi he
 The thorn in his path is far away and he is feeling that he will be able to gather again in the days to come
 lekin somvaar kii raily or shakti pradarshan ke baad unhen apni haalat kaa andaja lag gaya hoga
 It must have been a big shock for Nitish Babu
 baharhaal ab intjaar kiijie upachunaav ke parinaamon kaa or phir andaja lagegaa ki koun kitne pani main he

 rajya main 2017 kaa chunaav bhi isse alag nahin he
 This time in Punjab, Arvind Kejriwal, the Chief Minister of Delhi, who is making an election through the Aam Aadmi Party, is facing similar allegations
 kejariwal par virdohi aarope laga rahe hai ki wo pravasi sikhon main maujuud khalistaan samarthak tatwon ke sampark main hai
 In the past, similar allegations and counter-allegations have been leveled against each other by the Badal family and Captain Amarinder Singh
 khalistaan ke samarthan main do gutfilhal punjab main khalistaan kii vakaalat karne vaale do gut hai
 One of which is the Khalsa party, which talks of not having allegiance in the Indian Constitution
 doosraa simranjit singh maan kaa shiromani akali dal (amritsar) he, jo kai varshon se chunavi raajnneeti main sangharsh kar rahaa he
 Unlike the stand of the Shiromani Akali Dal (amritsar), the party does not participate in Khalsa state or national elections
 khalsa dal ke pravaktaa kanvarpal singh kaa kahana he ki hambharatiya vyavastha ke tahat chunaavon kaa bahishkaar karte hai
 According to Kanwarpal Singh, his group has no direct or indirect relationship with any political party
 kanvarpal singh ne kaha ki ham swatantra, samprabhu punjab ke himachati hai
 We want the Sikhs to be given the right to self-determination
 esajipisi or anya dharmik sansthaaon ke kathith durupyog ke liye khalsa dal badal parivaar ko jimmedaar tehraata he
 At the same time, he describes himself as a staunch opponent of the Badal family
 khalsa dal kii najar main aam aadmi party bhi alag nahin he
 Kanwarpal Singh said that the AAP is not a pro-punjab or pro-sikh community, but a pro-national party of India
 ham ek duusare se bilkul alag he
 Khalistani leaders who have reached the margins sitting abroad also support the ideology of the Khalsa Dal
 kai maukon par wo daure par aane vaale bhartiya sikh netaaon (chaahe wo kisi bhi dal ke hon) ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan karte bhi dikhte hai
 They have opposed everyone from Badal's father-son to Captain Amarinder Singh and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 misaal ke taur par neuyork sthit sanstha 'sikh for justise' ne to manmohan singh par vitt mantri rahete vakt bharat main sikh samudaay ke khilaaf maanviya aparaadhon ko funding karne kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 The way the clouds handled religious issues in Punjab, they are now facing opposition from the liberal Sikhs as they control the SGPC, the highest religious administration in the community
 akaal takht par bhi savaludaravaadi sikhon kaa prabhaavshaalee khemaa us vakt hairaan rah gaya tha jab akaal takht ne deraa sachcha sauda ke pramukh gurmeet ram rahim ko 2015 main maaf karne kaa elaan kiya tha
 Gurmeet Ram Rahim was accused of religious coercion because of wearing a dress like Guru Gobind Singh
 kai sikh maanate hai ki gurmeet ram rahim ko maafee kii patakatha badalon ne hi taiyaar kii thi
 However the Badal family has always denied such allegations
 sikhon ke virodh kii vajah se akaal takht ko maafee dene kaa faisla baad main waapas lenaa padaa tha lekin tab tak isaki sansthagat saakh par aanch aa gai thi
 Kiranjot Kaur, a senior member of the SGPC, says that those who care about their faith and want to restore the prestige of their religious institutions cannot be called extremists
 ye unka adhikaar he ki wo loktantric tareeke se kaam karte hue system se aniyamittaaon ko dur karen
 In New Jersey, 53-year-old Dilwar Singh runs a successful business of Sekhon Gas
 wo 1996 main america jaakar bas gaye the
 Sekhon is pro-khalistan, but at the moment his concern is not the 'political demand' of a separate nation but the drug problem of Punjab
 sekhon kaa kahana he ki punjab kaa noujvaan sankat main he or drugs main duba he
 Neither Shiromani Akali Dal nor Congress have ever taken this problem seriously
 jab medical council of india (emsiai) ne madhya pradesh ke paanch sarkari medical collejon main embibies ke liye do saal pehle badhaai gai 80 siton par pravesh na dene kii sifarish kii to ek baar phir chikitsa shiksha kii badahaali ujagar ho gai
 In 2011, India Today revealed the deteriorating health of the medical colleges of the state and after three and a half years there is no improvement in the situation even today
 pradesh ke 6 sarkari medical collejon main har saal kareeb 800 chaatr pravesh lete hai
 In 2013, MCI had increased the MBBS seats from medical colleges in Indore, Gwalior, Bhopal and Jabalpur from 140 to 150 and in Rewa Medical College from 60 to 100
 isse pradesh ko salanaa 80 atirikt doctor milane kii jo ummid jaagi, use emsiai kii taaja sifarish se dhakka laga he
 State Medical Education Minister Narottam Mishra says, "it has not come to my knowledge
 lekin aisa kuch he to sudhaar karenge
 "director, Medical Education Dr
 es
 s
 kushavaah bataate hai ki emsiai ko spashtikaran de diya gaya he
 The question of standards was found at the time of inspection of the medical colleges of the state in 2011, a large number of posts of medical teachers were found vacant, the same is the case even today (see box)
 isse pradesh main chikitsa shiksha ke str par sawalia nishaan lagate hai
 Dr
 kushavaah kehete hai, "str dekhne ke liye emsiai he
 "but the standards of MCI can also be questioned because the assessment report on which it has not recommended admission to additional seats, only the room, its area etc
 have been given importance, ignoring the faculty shortage
 pehle bhi lataki thi talwaarkhaali padon or anya suvidhaon kii kami ke chalate 2006 main emsiai ne jabalpur or reva medical collejon kii manyata khatm karne tak kii sifarish kar di thi

 P
 dvivedi kehete hai, "sarkaar asthaayee vyavastha karti he or nirikshan ke samay yahaan se vahaan tabadalaa kar shikshakon kii sankhya puri bataa di jaati he
 "looking at the number of vacancies in the list of fixing seniority of Directorate of Medical Education for the year 2013, Dwivedi's point gets strengthened
 is suchi ko 1 janvari, 2015 ko antim rup diya gaya he
 According to this, all 29 posts of assistant professors in anotomy in all medical colleges of the state have been vacant since 2010
 isi tarah biochemestry ke sah praadhyaapak ke sabhi 11 pad or sahaayak praadhyaapak ke sabhi 17 pad rikt hai
 30 out of 31 posts of co-professors and 58 out of 59 posts of assistant professors are vacant for surgery
 medical college swytt hai or shashan str par niyuktin hone par khud niyukti kar lete hai
 But people employed under autonomy do not get the same benefits

 Says Patel, "many qualified associate professors are not being promoted under autonomy due to lack of policy
" aise main professor ke pad to rikti rahenge hi
 "there is no reason why there are enough options to prevent medical teachers in government medical colleges
 nijee medical collejon kii badhati sankhya ne unke saamne vikalpon kii bharmaar kar di he
 This is the reason that even if new teachers come, old teachers are also leaving their jobs
 sarkari medical collejon main padonnati-kramonnati jaise laabhon main visangati bhi shikshakon kii kami kii vajah he
 Dr
 dvivedi kehete hai, "sarvice condishan bahut kharaab he, padonnati or kramonnati jaise mudde varshon se uljhe hai
 "it takes 20 years for an assistant professor to become a professor in the state
 dilli ke ekwas, pijii chandigarh, rajasthan or gujarat main sahaayak praadhyaapak chah saal main sah-praadhyaapak ban jaataa he lekin yahaan 12 saal lagate hai
 It takes 5 to 7 years to become a professor from a co-professor to another place, but 8 years in Madhya Pradesh
 isi kaa nateeja he ki pradesh ke sarkari medical collejon main sahaayak praadhyaapak or sah-praadhyaapakon kii gambhir kami he
 There is no provision for promotion for MBBS working as exhibitors, this hinders their growth
 pradesh sarkaar kaa niyam he ki jise 8 yaa 16 saal main bhi padonnati nahin mili, use ucchtar vetan diya jaataa he
 The discrepancy in implementing it became that the salary of the exhibitors was Rs 50,000 to 60,000 from the deans and professors as well
 zyada ho gaya
 Dr
 kushavaah kehete hai, "yah shashan kii niti he, isamen ham kya kar sakate hai? vaise pradarshak 20-25 saal se naukari kar rahe hai, yadi unhen laabh mil rahaa to kya harj he?"asal samasya par gaur nahinupalabdh siton par pravesh jari rakhane ke liye emsiai collejon kaa salanaa akalan karti he
 According to the MCI Executive Committee meeting held on March 2, it was recommended not to give admission to the increased seats in Shyam Shah Medical College, Rewa
 akalan main yahaan faikalti kii kami 12 fisad or resident kii 45 fisad kami pai gai
 The area required for the library, the capacity of the reading room and the demonstration room were also found to be low

 The CT Skane hospital does not belong, it is outsourced

 Dwivedi says, "it is not the people who operate the existing machine, so what to talk about additional machines? For some time in Rewa, the Department of Radiagnosis was locked up for three years because it had no faculty here
 "emsiai ne akalan main paaya ki gwalior, indore or jabalpur medical collejon main pariksha haul, librari, reeding room, clinical demastrishan room nishchit aakaar se chote hai or yahaan i-class or lacture theatre bhi nahin hai
 The MCI has recommended not admissions to the additional 10 seats of Jabalpur Medical College, on the basis that the capacity of the examination hall is only 240 instead of 750
 iske alaava yahaan 350 logon kii kshamta vaala lacture theatre bhi nahin he
 Similarly, in Gwalior Medical College, the deficiency of resident has been found to be 24 percent, while in Indore, Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College is about 16 percent short of senior resident

 Do they see how the trauma center is doing? ”this is what Dr
 dvivedi duusare rup main kehete hai, "nijee medical college kaise emsiai ko manage kar lete hai, yah sochane vaali baat he
 "however, on the recommendation of seat reduction, Minister of State for Medical Education Sharad Jain says," We are aware of the decision of MCI and we are preparing to improve the facilities
 " itnaa to saaf he ki sarkari medical college gambhir rog se jujh rahe hai lekin emsiai asal rog ko nahin pakad paa rahaa

 While inaugurating the RTR flyover in the past, the Kejriwal government had claimed that since Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has been built, 23 flyovers have been constructed in Delhi in the past 4 and a half years, the Delhi Congress reacted sharply to this claim

 Delhi Congress spokesperson Jitendra Kochhar said through RTI that Tejpal Singh, a Congress worker, had applied RTI, asking how many new flyovers have been constructed from April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2019? According to Jitendra Kochhar, that RTI exposed the claims of the Kejriwal government

 The Central Government has once again returned the recommendations of the Supreme Court Collegium made for High Court Judges
 inamen do vakeelon ko hoicourt kaa jaj banane kii sifarish kii thi
 It is surprising that the government has not given any reason for returning the recommendations for consideration again

 Earlier, the government had returned one of the names sent to the Collegium for several high courts for reconsideration
 lekin tab sarkaar ne iske peeche vajah bhi bataai thi
 The Supreme Court Collegium had sent the name of Mohammad Mansoor, the son of a former Supreme Court judge, to the Allahabad High Court judge
 lekin sarkaar ne unke khilaaf shikaayatein hone kii vajah bataate hue naam par phir se vichaar ke liye file lautaa di thi
 Mohammad Mansoor is the son of former Supreme Court Judge Sagir Ahmed
 sarkaar ne isi file ke saath ek or vakil bashaarat ali khan kaa naam bhi lautaaya tha
 The recommendations of the government which have just returned the file to the Collegium for reconsideration include the name of Nazir Ahmed Baig, proposed for the Jammu and Kashmir High Court

 That is, the government had no objection to the recommendation of the Supreme Court Collegium for these
 haalanki beg kii file lautaane par bhi sarkaar ne koi vajah nahin bataai he
 In April this year, the government had also returned to the collegium the recommendation to bring Uttarakhand High Court Chief Justice KM Joseph to the Supreme Court
 ye alag baat he ki colegium ne phir se sifarish kar joseph ko supreme court laane kii manshaa saaf kar sarkaar ko file waapas bhej di he

 When i heard the news of the attack on the Army School of Peshawar, first of all the children who were in that school were worried and the parents, who had a sudden trouble on the pieces of liver
 or jab news main tasviren dekhin to ankhen bhar ain
 
 
 "dude, just do it now
 
 
 
 God is the way "
 "20-20 saal maa-baap ne mehnat kar bacchon ko paala or unako maarane main inhen 20 second bhi nahin laga"
 
 
 These alphas belonged to the helpless father who had left his children in school in the morning

 They have come down so much that they have not missed the blood of innocent people

 This attack on children is being condemned from all sides, but the tehreek-e-taliban is taking credit for its brazenness that yes, we have done this strange act

 But what about the pain of those innocent children and their families
 
 
 ve maasoom jinaki ankhon main apane aane vaale kal ke liye hazaron sapane the
 The pain of those dreams which will haunt their families all their lives, the children who have survived this attack, will they ever forget this accident
 bhul paaenge ki unke doston ko sirf isliye maar diya gaya ki kuch logon kaa khof desh or duniya main bana rahe
 The Taliban is saying that they have avenged their pain

 That means the plant to which he watered with compost water, now an attempt is being made to cut it
 kya sachmuch talibani itane dare hue hai ki skool par hamalaa karke duniya ko bataanaa chaahate he ki ve kitne khataranaak hai
 Are the Taliban really so nervous that they chose the school to attack, where the children would have been scared on seeing the gun
 
 
 
 There, four terrorists blew themselves up, the car was set on fire, what is the strength of the Taliban that attacked the innocent and the weak, making the Taliban creepy
 kya sachmuch taliban apane vajood ko bachaane kii ladaai lard rahaa he yaa ye taliban ke khatme kii shuruyaat he?

 The judge gave such a verdict
 After this, Judge Sharma typed about two pages from his stano and after some time he accused Asaram of conviction
 asaram ke saath shilpi or sharatchand ko bhi jaj ne doshi qaraar diya

 But you neither wet nor complain

 Janata Janadan is the form of God, but people who do not believe in Janardan as God, they begin to consider themselves as emperors, when they reach the seventh sky in arrogance, then the condition of the people of Haryana in the Lok Sabha elections is shown
 ''piem modi ne congress par joardaar hamalaa bolte hue kaha, ''jinhone haryana kii shant, samarth or sankalpashil birdari main bantwaare kaa jehar gholne kaa prayaas kiya, unako aapane sabak sikhaa diya
 In democracy, public is paramount, its desire is above all
 sonipat kaa matlab hi he kisaan, jawan or pahalwaan
 The BJP government has tried its best to strengthen this trinity of Sonepat
 agle paanch saal main isi trishakti ke aadhaar par hamane shashakt haryana, shashakt bharat banane kaa faisla kiya he
 "they said," Do you remember what happened on August 5? On August 5, it happened, which the country had left behind in some way
 5 agast ko jammu-kashmir main bharat kaa puraa samvidhan lagu hua
 For 70 years, the biggest hindrance in the development of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, we removed 5
 5 agast se congress or unki saath mileebhagat waalon ke pet main aisa dard uthaa he, jisapar koi dawa kaam nahin kar paa rahi
 Abdominal pain has become an incurable disease of Congress
 ''congress ko ped dard kii shikaayat bataate hue piem modi ne kaha, ''congress ko aisi beemaari hui he ki ham svachh bharat kii baat karte hai to congress ke pet main marod hone lagati he
 When it comes to surgical strikes, the abdominal pain of the Congress increases
 koi balakot kaa naam letaa he to congress dard ke maare chatapataane lagati he
 Now the country has also come to know that why does the Congress feel this pain? Whose sympathy is for whom
 aapane dekha hoga ki congress ke netaaon ke kashmir par jo bayaan aae wo kiske kaam aa rahe hai, uskaa laabh koun uthaa rahaa he, kahaan-kahaan uskaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 "PM Modi attacked the Congress strongly and said," What is the chemistry of Congress with Pakistan? who is this for? You have to find the answer in this election
 congress ko haryana ke un vir sapooton kii bhaawanaaon se bilkul fark nahin padataa, jo jammu-kashmir or ladakh kii suraksha ke liye vahaan date hue hai
 The Congress should say as much good and bad as Modi, but be proud of Mother India
 simaaen itani bhi na laaghen ki jo desh kaa nuksaan ho
 The Congress, which was the biggest opponent to remove 370, is now trying to take over Haryana
 ''unhone kaha, ''congress ko haryana kii un maataaon kii, un betiyon kii samvednaa kaa bilkul khyaal nahin he, jinhone apane sapooton ko, apane suhaag ko, apane pita ko maa bharti ke liye shahid hote hue dekha he
 The Congress is also not worried about the sentiments of the Dalits and backwards, who were denied their legitimate rights in Jammu and Kashmir for seven decades of independence
 congress ko naa to bharat kii ekta kii chintaa he or na hi baba sahib ambedkar ke die hue samvidhan kii
 Those who are not worried about mother Bharati, who are not worried about Mati, can Haryana worry about them? In this election, selectively exclude such people
 unhen kahie ki ab bahut ho gaya

 satta main ek saal puraa hone se pehle yogi sarkaar ne gujarat model kii tarj par uttar pradesh kaa pehla inwaster summit yojit karte hue desh or duniya ke bade se bade kaarobaari ko pradesh main nivesh karne kaa aamantran diya
 On this occasion, the heads of groups like Birla, Reliance and Adani, who reached the capital Lucknow, said in one clear word that they are announcing big investments for Uttar Pradesh because without putting Uttar Pradesh at the center of economic activities, India should be placed in the world
 At the level, economic power cannot be created
 china bhi apane bade rajyon ke sahare bana aarthik shaktiduniya kii sabase badi aarthik shakti china susti ke daur se guzar rahaa he
 Some of its provisions have played an important role in making China an economic powerhouse having recorded a growth rate of 10 per cent for 30 consecutive years
 desh kii jidipi main in rajyon kaa sarvaadhik yogadan bhi he
 The special thing is that by looking at the economic data, it is clear that these provinces are the most densely populated areas of China and with this dense population, China has succeeded in becoming the world's largest economy
 ise padhein: mantriyon se puche gaye in 10 sawaalon ke jawaab main chupa he yogi sarkaar kaa report cardgujarat model se ummidautar pradesh main invester summit ke liye saje manch se ek ke baad ek shakhsiyat or sambhavit niveshkon ne 2003 kaa vah manjar yaad dilaayaa jab gujarat kii kaman sanbhaalane ke baad tatkaaleen mukhyamantri narendra modi ne wibrant gujarat kii neenv rakhi
 The forum in Lucknow claimed that the Vibrant Gujarat Summit opened the way for large investment in Gujarat, making Gujarat the leading state in the country in business
 lihaaja isi tarj par chalate hue ab uttar pradesh ko desh kaa ahm vanijyik kshetra banaaya jayega
 Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state in India by population
 lihaaja bharat ke liye china jaisi arthvyavastha ko pakadaney or use pachhaadne ke liye jaruri he ki bharat main bhi aarthik vikaas ke kendra main uttar pradesh ko rakhaa jaae

Speaking From The Forum Of The UP Investors Summit, The Big Industrialists Of The Country With The Investment Of Thousands Of Crores Over The Next Year The state has claimed to create millions of new jobs
 inamen yadi rajya ke sabase bade niveshak aditya birla group ke chairman kumaar mangalam birla ne rajya kii aarthik gatividhiyon main 25,000 karod rupee kaa nivesh kaa daawa kiya to desh ke sabase bade kaarobaari mukesh ambani ne teen saal main 10,000 karod rupee ke nivesh ke saath ek lakh se adhik naukariyaan dene kaa daawa kiya
 Gautam Adani, the head of the Adani Group, who is attending the summit, has claimed a total investment of Rs 45,000 crore for the expansion of his companies in the state over the next few years
 inke alaava kai kshetron main videshi companiyon ne uttar pradesh ke evester summit ke dauraan rajya main bade nivesh kaa elaan kiya he
 Significantly, in the dairy sector, companies in Europe, including the Netherlands, have signed an agreement for investment of thousands of crores by making almost 500 agreements
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki kya uttar pradesh kaa yah inwaster summit bhi wibrant gujarat kii tarah rajya kii aarthik tasviir ko badalane main kaamyaab hota he? yadi aane vaale varshon main in bade aarthik niveshon kaa rasta saaf hota he or gujarat model ko upi main safalataa milti he to aane vaale dinon main china kii barabari karne ke liye uttar pradesh ahm bhoomika adaa karte dekha jayega

 According to Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari's doctor, now his condition is stable

 According to the news agency Associated Press of Pakistan, Zardari's physician Colonel Salman issued a health bulletin on Wednesday, saying, "the President's health has been regularly checked
