 Hariprasad had said that Amit Shah got scared and got fever due to the return of our mlas in Karnataka
 unako koi aam bukhaar nahin hua he
 He has had Pig Fever
 agar vah karnataka kii sarkaar ko giraane kii koshish karenge to vah yah jaan jaaen ki unako sirf swine flu nahin balki ulti or looj moshan bhi hoga
 The BJP retaliated by Hariprasad's statement
 kendriya mantri piyush goyal ne hariprasad par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki jis tarah kaa ganda or behuda bayaan congress ke saansad bike hariprasad ne amit shah ke swasthya ke liye diya he, yah congress ke str ko darshata he
 Amit Shah is undergoing treatment for flu, but the treatment of mental illness of Congress leaders is difficult
 bataa den ki hariprasad rajyasabha ke upasabhapati chunaav main endie ummidavaar harivansh ke khilaaf congress ke ummidavaar the
 However, he had to face defeat in this election and Harivansh won
 bijepi kii aaj ramlila maidan main ralyloksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar bijepi aaj ramlila maidan main dilli bijepi vijay sankalp raily kaa aayojan karegi
 In this rally, effigies of Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal will be installed, these effigies have been named effigies of lies
 is yuva vijay sankalp mahareli ko madhya pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chaihaan sambodhit karegein
 Apart from this, former National President of BJP Yuva Morcha Anurag Thakur and current President Poonam Mahajan and Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari will also address this rally
 mulaayam singh yadav ne party ke siem ummidavaar par apana stand badal diya he
 Now they are ready again to make Akhilesh the CM face of the party
 chand dinon pehle unhone kaha tha ki chunaav jeetne ke baad vidhayak tay karenge ki koun siem hoga
 There were also rumors in political circles that Akhilesh would now form his own party
 mana ja rahaa he ki is tarah damege control kii koshish shuru ho gai he
 In the Samajwadi Party's State Office Auditorium, sitting in the same chair and in the same chair today, Mulayam's envoy and party's Rajya Sabha member Krishnamay Nanda announced on behalf of Mulayam that Akhilesh is the CM candidate
 
 
 jahaan se teen roj pehle mulaayam ne khud kaha tha ki siem koun hoga yah chunaav ke baad vidhayak tay karenge
 Krishnamay Nanda said, “the next government will be that of the Samajwadi Party
 
 And Akhilesh Yadav is his face
 jo desh ke sabase behtareen mukhyamantri hai
 This is the message of Mulayam Singh, which i have come to give you
 ”tippaniyan In the father-son war, Akhilesh was feeling lonely lately because Mulayam again made Gayatri Prajapati a minister against Akhilesh's will
 
 
 amar singh ko mahasachiv bana diya
 
 
 Seven young leaders close to Akhilesh were expelled from the party
 
 
 kaumi ekta dal kaa sapa main vilay kar diya
 
 
 And fixed the ticket for Mukhtar Ansari
 udhar akhilesh apane un yuva doston ke saath saarvajanik program main najar aae jinhen mulaayam singh yadav ne party se barkhaast kar diya tha
 And there was an uproar when Akhilesh said in an interview that he would go alone in the election campaign, he even kept his name to himself as a child
 shaayad 75 saal ke baap ko jawan bete kii yah baat dil ko lag gai or unhone ek press conference main ek sawaal ke jawaab main kah diya ki “aglaa siem koun hoga yah chunaav jeetne ke baad vidhayak tay karenge
 " iske baad afvaahon ne jor pakadaa ki akhilesh yadav apni nai party bana rahe hai
 
 
 They can go with the Congress
 
 
 vagairah
 
 vagairah
 But today, Mulayam Singh called Akhilesh home for a meeting
 samaajawaadee party ke state aphis ke auditorium main aaj thik us jagah or usee kursi par baithkar mulaayam ke doot or party ke rajyasabha sadsy krishnamay nanda ne mulaayam kii taraf se elaan kiya ki akhilesh hi siem candidet hai
 
 
 Whereupon three days ago, Mulayam himself said that the MLA will decide who will be the CM after the election
 krishnamay nanda ne kaha, “agali sarkaar samaajawaadee party kii hi hogi
 
 or akhilesh yadav hi uskaa cheharaa hai
 Who is the best Chief Minister of the country
 yahi mulaayam singh kaa sandesh he, jo main aapako dene aayaa hum
 "comments baap-bete kii jang main pichley dinon laga ki akhilesh akele padate ja rahe hai, kyonki akhilesh kii marji ke khilaaf mulaayam ne gayatri prajapati ko phir mantri banavaa diya
 
 
 Made Amar Singh the General Secretary
 
 
 akhilesh ke kareebi saat yuva netaaon ko party se nikaal diya
 
 
 Qaumi Ekta Dal merged with SP
 
 
 or mukhtaar ansaari kaa tikat tay kar diya
 Meanwhile, Akhilesh appeared in a public program with his young friends, who were dismissed by Mulayam Singh Yadav from the party
 or tab to hangaamaa hi ho gaya jab akhilesh ne ek intervyuu main kah diya ki ve akele chunaav prachaar main chale jaaenge, unhone to apana naam bhi bachapan main khud hi rakh liya tha
 Perhaps the 75-year-old father felt this about the young son and in a press conference he said in response to a question that "who will be the next CM will decide the MLA after winning the election
" ” After this, rumors got loud that Akhilesh Yadav was forming his new party
 
 
 ve congress ke saath ja sakate hai
 
 
 Et cetera
 
 Et cetera
 lekin aaj mulaayam singh ne akhilesh ko meeting ke liye ghar bulaayaa
 In the father-son war, Akhilesh was feeling lonely lately because Mulayam again made Gayatri Prajapati a minister against Akhilesh's will

 isamen do lakh rupee jyotikumaaran ko dilli ke ek paanch sitara hotel main 10 or 11 april ko chuktaa kar diye gayi or teen lakh rupee unke aadmi ko dilli main dene kaa vaayada tay hua

 He said that after recording his conversations with the channel representative secretly, it has been intentionally manipulated

 One scam after another has been following the Congress government at the Center
 uske namjad kiye pudducheri ke uparajyapal (alji)ikbaal singhke ek ghotaale se jude hone kii vajah se centre kii congress sarkaar to pareshaani main padi hi, centreshasit pradesh main bhi kursi sanbhaalane vaali congress ko sharmasaar hona pad rahaa he, jahaan vah teesri baar satta main aane kikoshish kar rahi he
 The result of the seemingly minor investigation revealed that Iqbal Singh's relations were exposed to tax evader Hassan Ali Khan, who turned black money
 centre or centreshasit pradesh main congress kii sarkaron ke liye ikbaal singh kaa ek kathith anuchit vyavhaar bhi musiibat kii jad ban gaya he
 The Lieutenant Governor was trying to open a medical college in Karaikal in the name of South Educational Trust, which has two sons and close relatives members, including the special work officer of Rajnivas
 ikbaal singh par is centreshasit pradesh main ek gurdvara banane ke liye 28,000 varg foot jameen hathiyaane kaa prayaas karne kaa aarope laga, haalanki yahaan sikhon kii aabaadi naganya he (aankadon ke mutabik, yahaan maatr 120 sikh rahete hai)
 In this way, the Lt
 Governor of Puducherry has been embroiled in many disputes
 india today ke paas maujuud dastavejon se pataa chalata he ki ikbaal singh ne apane do beton samet rishtedaaron kii madad karne, trust banane or pudducheri main ek medical college tathaa aspataal kholane ke prayaas main apane pad kaa durupyog kiya
 They are denying that their family members have any connection with the South Educational Trust, but documents with India Today show that their two sons in the six-member trust are Amarjot Singh and Abhay Singh, their relative Tejinder Pal Singh and his OSD J
 pi
 Singh's sons include Chetanpal Singh
 kagajaat se pataa chalata he ki is trust ne prakriyaaon kaa koi paalan kiye bagaiyr medical college ke liye jaruri praaanpatr hasil kar liya tha
 Puducherry Revenue Minister Malladi Krishna Rao told India Today, "the Cabinet has not given any NOC for that medical college
" use isaki koi jaankaree nahin he
 Until the charges are proved, i do not think the Lieutenant Governor will have to step down
 ''swatantraaa senaanee laal singh or santokh cor ke putr ikbaal singh ne 1969 main punjab vishvavidhyalay se snaatak parihna paas kii

 unhen ek baar bihar main chunaav paryvekshak bhi banaaya gaya or ve akhil bhartiya congress ke prabhaavshaalee logon ke kareebi maane jate the
 Sources in Puducherry Congress said, "due to his grip in the All India Congress and the Congress being in trouble, the high command decided to appoint him as the Lt
 Governor of Puducherry in 2009
 '' ve pradhanmantri karyaalay main rajyamantri ve
 He is also close to Narayanasamy as both were Rajya Sabha members in the early '90s
 narayansami ne ikbaal singh kii congress main pakad or apane saath rishton ke bare main puche jane par bataaya, ''haa, ve mere dost hai
 i always keep good relations with all political leaders, rising above the parties
 is tarah se ikbaal bhi mere dost hai
 Narayanasamy is believed to have helped him to become the Governor of Puducherry
 is sawaal par rajyamantri ne kaha, ''ve centreshasit pradesh ke sanvaidhanik adhikari hai or unki niyukti se congress party kaa koi lenadena nahin he
 Who am i to suggest his name for that post and where does the Congress party come from in this case
 ''lekin grih mantralay ke centrerajya sambhag ke paas june, 2009 main file ai to usne ikbaal singh ko pudducheri kaa uparajyapal niyukt karne par aapatti jataai thi
 The reason for this objection was that Iqbal Singh was accused of misusing election-related money in Bihar
 ve 2009 main loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan rajya main chunaav prabharee hua karte the
 There have been many stories of corruption of Iqbal Singh in political circles of Bihar
 ab un par kaale dhan ko safed karne vaale, kar chor hasan ali khan se sambandh ke gambhir aarope lage hai
 During 1997, Iqbal Singh recommended a quick passport to Khan
 sutron ke mutabik, grih mantralay ne yah kehete hue unki niyuktiper aapatti jataai thi ki sandigdh chhavi vaale logon ko uparajyapal yaa rajyapal pad par niyukt karke pad kii garima kam nahin kerani chahie
 "with the help of the Intelligence Bureau, the work of the Ministry of Home Affairs was to investigate the background of the person and give his recommendation
 aakhirkaar, kisi rajyapal kii niyukti kaa visheshadhikaar us samay kii sarkaar kaa hota he
 "congress is now trying to fight Pallu with Iqbal Singh
" use lag rahaa he ki yah maamla purv kendriya satarkta ayukta (sivisi) pi
 J
 thomas maamle kii tarah tool pakad saktaa he, lihaaja sarkaar ne ikbaal singh ko pad chhodane ke liye samajhnaa bhi shuru kar diya he
 For this reason, both the Home Ministry and the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) allowed the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to interrogate him
 kuch sanvaidhanik adhikaar barkaraar rakhane ke liye piemo ne kaha ki idi ko unase poochtacha karne ke liye pudducheri ke rajbhavan main janaa chahie
 The ED wanted to call him to his office and sit in front of the other accused Amalendu Pandey
 vah donon se ek saath sawaal karnaa chahta tha kyonki donon ke bayaan alag alag hai
 Iqbal Singh says that he recommended on Pandey's request only
 unke anusaar unhone congress netaa pandey ke kehane par tatkaaleen videsh mantri inder kumaar gujral (unke pradhanmantri banane se thik pehle) se anukanpa ke aadhaar par khan ke passport ko manjuuri dene kii sifarish kii thi
 But Pandey told the ED that Iqbal Singh knew Khan at his level and he also knew who the passport was for
 is bich, dastavejon ke mutabik, south ajukational trust pudducheri main rajanivas ke paas hi ek daftar se sanchalit hota he
 But according to papers with India Today, her registration names a property that was confiscated by the Puducherry police in the 1999 Parvati Shah murder case
 pudducheri ke sthaneey kaaryakarta namdhivarman kaa kahana he, ''pudducheri police ne us sampatti kaa durupyog karaane ke liye uske kagajaat uparajyapal ke daftar ko saunp die hai
 Later, the trust approached the government for a 'certificate of Qualification' in the format stated by the Medical Council of India (MCI) but this certificate could not be issued as the MCI rules for opening a medical college - 300 bed hospital - followed had not been
 mukhya sachiv aar
 Chandramohan said in a release that the trust then demanded a certificate so that it could slowly take money from the bank for the project to fulfill the terms of the MCI
 vijyapti main kaha gaya ki emsiai ke 'arhata praaanpatr' ke aadhaar par ek parishkrut 'arhata praaanpatr' 25 farvari ko jari kar diya gaya
 But on the basis of this certificate, application for opening a new medical college cannot be made in MCI
 chandramohan ne kaha ki jab trust emsiai kii jaruri sharten puri kar de tabhi asli 'arhata praaanpatr' diya ja saktaa he
 The Director of Health Services examines those conditions and then a certificate is issued with the recommendation of the Cabinet
 lekin pudducheri main mukhyamantri ve
 An official close to Vaidyalingam told India Today that the South Educational Trust had given a copy of the land agreement for the land in Karaikal
 jab kagajaat pudducheri ke swasthya sachiv ke paas hastakshar ke liye aae to unhen khaarij kar diya gaya
 But when the file reached the Health Minister Valsaraj, he wrote 'no Comment' in the letter of request and sent it to Chief Minister Vaidyalingam, who then sent it to the Lieutenant Governor for approval
 centreshasit pradesh ke niyamon ke mutabik, anaapatti praaanpatr dene kaa antim adhikaar uparajyapal ko hi hota he
 He said, "the first thing is that when the Health Minister comes with a letter of request to open a medical college, he has no right to say 'no comment'
" or phir mukhyamantri use aage uparajyapal ko nahin bhej saktaa
 India Today contacted Puducherry Chief Minister Vaidyalingam in this regard, but declined to comment
 unhone kaha, ''adarsh aachaar samhita lagu he or main is mudde evam uparajyapal par aaropon ke bare main kuch bataa nahin saktaa kyonki ve pradesh ke sanvaidhanik pramukh hai
 Sources close to him say that the Congress Government of the Union Territory is deeply troubled and in trouble
 lekin south ajukational trust ke chairman es
 Tejinder Pal Singh dismissed all the news as "malicious" and said Iqbal Singh had no connection with the medical college project
 ''yah niraadhaar or shararthpurna aarope he
 Out of the six members of the trust, three people, including two sons of the Lt
 Governor have resigned
 pudducheri sarkaar ne is trust ko koi jameen nahin di he
 This is a private initiative from the Trust
 '' unhone kaha ki trust kalyankari pariyojnaayen chalaane ke liye shuru kiya gaya tha
 Its objectives were to establish a medical college
 unhone kaha ki pudducheri main is trust ke khilaaf ''jabardast lamabandi'' he or is medical college pariyojna se uparajyapal kaa koi vaasta nahin he
 But when Indiatude jed the OSD of the Lt
 Governor
 pi
 When he tried to contact Singh and his son Chetanpal Singh, both of them did not reply despite repeated calls and messages
 chetanpal singh ne phone uthaaya or sirf itnaa kaha, ''mujhe aapaki koi baat sunai nahin de rahi he'' or phir phone kaat diya
 J
 pi
 Singh asked this reporter to call after 10 minutes
 baad main unhone phone hi nahin uthaaya
 After getting approval from the PMO, the ED interrogated Iqbal Singh at Rajnivas for more than 20 minutes
 unke sachiv ne bataaya ki idi adhikariyon ne rajanivas main uparajyapal se mulaakaat kii
 He declined to say whether the ED asked him anything about his relationship with Khan
 unhone samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya, ''main sirf itnaa hi bataa saktaa hum or isse zyada kuch or nahin bataa saktaa
 "with the new controversies, the political leaders of this union territory feel that the Lt
 Governor has embarrassed the Congress government

 amit shah ne kanoon ke virodh main vaktavy dene vaale sadasyon se kaha ki yah kanoon aapane hi banaaya or 2004 main, 2008 tathaa 2013 main sanshodhan kaa hamane samarthan kiya kintu vipaksh main jate hi aapaki najar, najaara or bhaashan badal gaye
 He said that whatever law should be brought to stop terrorism, everyone should support it because terrorism has no religion, it is against humanity
 kendriya grih mantri ne kaha, 'yuapie yaa kisi anya kanoon main vyaktigat aatankwaadi ko namit karne kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he
 Therefore, when a terrorist organization is banned, its members form a new organization
 vyakti ko aatankwaadi ghoshit karne ke maamle par grih mantri ne yaccin bhatkal kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki yadi 2009 main hi yaccin bhatkal ko aatankwaadi ghoshit kar diya gaya hota to paristhitiyaan alag hotin
 Shah said that the institution is made up of a person and the person does an incident and the organization does not do it, so it is necessary to declare the person a terrorist
 aatankwaad aaj puure vishwa kii samasya he isliye duniya ke kai deshon ke andar apane-apane kanoon banaae gaye hai
 He said that in many countries of the world including the United Nations, a person is declared a terrorist
 amit shah ne kaha ki kanoon ke durupyog rokane ke liye bahut sari saavdhaaniyaan rakhi gai hai
 Responding to the misuse of the opposition law, Amit Shah said that the opposition should remember the time of emergency when the law was most misused
 shah ne yah bhi kaha ki samjhauta express maamle main pehle kuch aaropee pakade gaye baad main raajnneetik kaarnon se nakli maamla bana kar dusron ko aaropee banaaya gaya
 Amit Shah said that as per the provisions of UAPA at present, terrorism linked property can be confiscated only with the written approval of the DGP of the state in which such property is located
 kai baar aatanki vibhinn rajyon main apni sampatti rakhte hai
 In such cases, it becomes difficult to get the approval of DGP of different states and due to which delays, the property of the accused can be transferred
 isliye jald se jald aatankwaad se judi sampattiyon ko jabt karnaa aavashyak he
 This amendment empowers the DG NIA to seize property that is linked to terrorism in connection with the investigation being conducted by the NIA
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki enie kii sajaa kii dar 91 pratishat he jo vaishvik str par sarvshereshth he
 The Union Minister appealed to all the members to come together to support the amendment and said that if this law is passed with one vote, then there will be a good message for our agency in the world and the threat of our law on the world's terrorists Will increase

 In the Calcutta High Court, women were 'pissed off' in the Election Commission and the state government's lawsuit over the panchayat elections
 rajya ke mahadhivaktaa (edwocket general) bimal chatarji ne chunaav ayog ko aisi khubasurat ladki qaraar diya, jo roj nai farmaaish karti he
 This comment was not made anywhere else but in the court and women were targeted
 ittefaq se rajya chunaav ayog kii adhyaksh bhi ek mahila mira pandeya hai
 Chatterjee said, according to the government, the attitude of the Commission in terms of demands has been unilateral and arbitrary and demands have been changing from time to time
 mahadhivaktaa kaa bayaan aise samay main aayaa he, jab rajya main panchayat chunaav karaane ke muddon par rajya sarkaar or chunaav ayog ke bich gatirodh he
 Coming out of the court, the Election Commission lawyer strongly criticized this statement

 The comments vipakshi congress ne chatarji ke istife kii maang karte hue kaha ki unke bayaan se mahilaon kaa apmaan hua he
 West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee President Pradeep Bhattacharya said that we demand his resignation for derogatory and unnecessary remarks

 The Congress is not looking anywhere in the race far and wide
 pichley saadhe chaar saal main modi lahar kamjor padi he or modi kaa ikbaal bhi kam hua he
 Its smaller allies are now showing eyes to the BJP
 pehle upendra kushvaha alag hue or ab apana dal ne qamar kas lee he
 In such a situation, the maneuvers adopted in the elections will be interesting indeed
 *** Prime Minister Narendra Modi's honor ceremony was held at the BJP headquarters after the historic victory in the assembly elections of five states
 is avasar par bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne piem modi ko aazaadee ke baad desh kaa sabase lokapriy pradhanmantri qaraar diya
 Amit Shah said that Narendra Modi is the most popular Prime Minister of the country
 paanch rajyon kii janata ne 2014 main jo aitihaasik parivartan hua tha usase bhi zyada samarthan dekar piem ke kaam par apni muhar lagaai he
 After a very long time in Uttar Pradesh, we have formed a BJP government with a three-fourth majority, this victory of the Bharatiya Janata Party is an unexpected victory, with an equally strong majority in Uttarakhand, we are going to form a government of BJP also here we got a three-fourth majority
 is
 shah ne kaha ki manipur or goa main janata ne bijepi kaa acha samarthan diya he or hamaara pradarshan bhi bahut acha rahaa he
 The elections held in the five states are going to be taken two steps ahead of the historic mandate of 2014 elections
 2014 main jab modi ji ne desh kaa netritv karnaa aarambh kiya to har taraf anischitata kaa maahaul tha lekin bijepi kaa itihaas desh kii aazaadee ke baad ke itihaas main svarnim aksharon main likhaa jayega
 Shah said that while being elected the leader of the parliamentary party after the Lok Sabha elections, Modi had given a historic speech that the BJP government is the government for the poor, dalits, backward and adivasis
 aaj ham kah sakate hai ki ye sirf bhaashan nahin tha balki piem kaa krittiv tha
 Demonetisation, toilets, gas stove in two crore houses, electricity in 16 thousand villages, Jan Dhan account of five crores has worked to connect PM Modi with the poor of the country
 mujhe kehane main koi sankoch nahin he ki aaj aazaadee ke baad sarvaadhik lokapriy hone ke saath saath sava sau karod ke desh main ek raajnneetijna ne garibon ke man main apane liye shraddha paidaa kii he
 This is a big deal
 janata ne hampar jovishwaas rakhaa he visheshkar piem modi par jo vishwaas rakhaa he bijepi usapar khara utregi or janabhaawanaaon ke allurup kaam karegi, ham sab deshbhar ke kaaryakarta modi ji ke netritv se gauravanvit mahasoos kar rahe hai
 In the coming days, Himachal, Gujarat and Karnataka are also going to go to the southern states and in the 2019 elections, the party will come with a larger public opinion than the present majority

 But this time Azam Khan himself is also in discussion

 Challenging Azam Khan to his seat is Tanveer, a popular doctor from the region who is a BSP candidate

 Dr
 Tanveer had also contested the elections against Azam Khan the last time and was in second place
 ajam khan na sirf samaajawaadee party ke muslim cheharaa hai, balki saat baar yah vidhansabha seat jeet chuke hai

 The Nawabganj seat of Bareilly is also in discussion where Kesar Singh, who left the BSP before the election and joined the BJP, got a ticket

 If BSP contests elections strongly in this area, then BJP will also benefit

 It will also be clear from this stage that Mayawati's strategy of fielding 100 Muslim candidates is being successful or not

 'aaj tak' ke paas mahila evam bal vikaas mantri rahe sandip kumaar kaa wo tyaag patr he, jo unhone mukhyamantri ko likhaa tha
 In the letter sent to Arvind Kejriwal on August 31, after the objectionable CD came to the headlines, 'honorable Chief Minister, i came to know about the news through news, in which a conspiracy has been hatched against me

 'obviously after this letter, the question now arises that when Sandeep Kumar himself gave his resignation letter to the Chief Minister after seeing the news, then why did the leaders of Aam Aadmi Party say that they first took action and gave Kumar a minister Removed from office salaami ballebaaj kris gail ne apane karier kaa sarvshereshth pradarshan karte hue test cricket main do tihare shatak jamaane vaale ballebaajon ke ilit club main shaamil hue jisase westeindies ne srilanka ke khilaaf pehle test match main vishaal score khadaa kiya

 In fact, many women on Twitter shared their date experiences and said what men think about the bodies of women

 In response to these tweets, some people wrote that boys and girls should stop segregating in the class of biology in the classroom
 doesn’t suprise me, a PE teacher at my school was around 40 & thought they only lasted a day? makes me think why do we seperate (biological) girls & boys for sex ed, when it would make much more sense for both sexes to know about each other’s bodies as well as their own?— elle 🥝 (@onlinelle)september 2, 2018 His visit to 45 villages in the four most backward districts of the state was truly baffling

 Even at the age of sixty, Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje is so quick that she was moving faster than the youngster showing all this plight
 yah durdasha ab tak rajya kii sarkaron ke gramin ilaakon kii sud na lene kii ek misaal he
 Looking at the three extremely nervous officers running with her, Vasundhara says angrily about the school's plight, "there are only 30 children in ten classes

 For the ten days between 9 to 18 February, for the first time the government staff reached remote villages of Bharatpur, Sawai Madhopur, Karauli and Dhaulpur under a campaign named "sarkar Aapke Dwar"
 raaje apane mantriyon ke saath jamini str kii vaastaviktaaon kaa jayja lene pahunchin thim
 But these facts turned out to be shocking

 The Senior Secondary School of Samaraya village in Bharatpur was an example of the plight of the entire region
 isaki kakshaen andheri or sillen se bhari hui thim
 The school was overstating its computer lab, but seven of its ten computers purchased five years ago were defective
 padhai-likhaai kaa to bura haal tha
 Most of the 200 students of class 9 to 12 failed to read even a simple English sentence
 bijli kaa conection do maah pehle cat gaya tha or lambey samay se bekaar pade jenerator ko chalaane ke liye dijal kharidne ko paise nahin the
 The drinking water arrangements for the students were also not in good condition

 But as if there was a mountain of problems in front of the Raje government

 Raje confined his convoy to eight vehicles
 17 farvari ko savai madhopur se bayana tak kii yatra train se kii or ise aam aadmi se judaav kaa jariya banaaya
 The common passengers in the S-4 coach of the Golden Temple Express were stunned to see the Chief Minister among themselves

 Raje grew up and enjoyed a meal from fellow travelers Tiffin
 unhone kaha ki isse unhen bachapan ke dinon main apni maa ke saath madhya pradesh ke jangalon main dhimi raftaar se chalane vaali railgadee or baiylgaadee kii yatra kii yaad taaja ho gai

 yah abhiyaan rajya main vidhansabha kii kul 200 main se 163 siton ke janadesh se mili satta main aane ke dobaaraa maukey ko sarthak banane kaa he
 It is also part of a cleverly devised political strategy to cut a good election crop to make his good friend Narendra Modi the Prime Minister

 Raje promises that what Modi did in Gujarat, he will repeat in Rajasthan
 ve kahati hai, ‘‘agar gujarat, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh kii tasviir 10-15 saal main badal sakati he to ham kyon nahin kar sakate?’’ or log unki baton par yakeen bhi kar rahe hai
 However, many, including some of his senior ministers, questioned the campaign to highlight the state's enormous backwardness, which has been born out of decades of political and administrative apathy and corruption
 aise logon kii chintaa he ki rajya ke 40,000 gaanvon main peyajal kii aapurti or 20,000 kimi sadakon ke network ko durust karnaa kaaphi dushkar kaam sabit ho saktaa he
 But he rebuked these people as "pessimistic" and went ahead with the intention of exposing the plight of Congress leader Ashok Gehlot during his five-year tenure

 At that time, she was 50 years old and very irritable

 She questions the success of the much-hyped central schemes like MNREGA and food security

 In his words, "bharatpur division and its adjoining areas have been the weakest link for BJP in the recent assembly elections, so the Chief Minister wants to gain a foothold in these areas so that the six parliamentary seats can benefit in the Lok Sabha elections
" ’’ payalat ko yakeen he ki yah nuskhaa kaam nahin aayega
 However, after this campaign Raje returned to the Aaramgah of Jaipur, a part of the bridge constructed in Sawai Madhopur district of Rajasthan State Road Development Corporation was sunk on February 19, a day after the first trial
 yah purvavarti sarkaar main bhrashtachar kii ek misaal he
 But it is also clear that Raje and his ministers will not get the facility to rest in their future plans

 lamba ko vriksh mitra ke naam se janaa jaataa he

 lamba apane saath kai logon ko jodne ke liye ek enjio kaa sanchaalan bhi kar rahe hai
 Lamba along with his NGO Kalpataru Sansthan has also stopped several housing schemes of the state to stop the felling of trees and shifted them to another location

 "everyone must live hostel life once in a lifetime
 " ye statement kisi mahapurush kaa nahin balki hostel se nikalne vaale ek hostler kaa hota he
 Hostel away from the house is a world where both happiness and sorrow meet and we learn to live life with them
 jaane aakhir kyon hoti he hostel life har kisi ke liye itani khaas:hostel kaa khanahostel aane se pehle khaane ko lekar hamaare dheron nakhre hote hai
 We eat potatoes but not gourd, excess water and thick rice in pulses spoil our mood
 lekin hostel aane par aapke nakhre kab hawa ho jate hanapako khud bhi pataa nahin chalata
 Menus are not made in the hostel by asking you
 isliye jab jo parosa jaae use aapako khaanaa hi hoga
 In the initial stages, the tantrums of many people remain the same, but not a month has been completed so that everyone's wisdom is there
 ham sabakuch khaane lagate hai
 Although hostel food is never tasty, it still feels good
 hostel ke sakht niyamsbase pehla rule jo hostel main ghusane ke saath bataaya jaataa he wo he raat 10 baje ke pehle aapako har haal main hostel pahunchnaa hoga
 If you do not do this, then the doors will be opened only after talking to your parents
 is niyam ko sunakar parents jitne khush hoten hai vahiin rahane vaala dukhi
 Lunch will begin at 1 pm and at 8 pm
 agar aap kisi kaaran deree karte hai to uski jaankaree den varanaa khaanaa khatm
 Maggi is most useful at this place
 lekin ab wo bhi saath chhod chuki he,isliye biscuit khaakar guzaara chalata he
 Here you are prohibited from using any kind of electronic devices
 kahin aapane press rakhi he or iske bare main wardan ko pataa chal gaya to to bas khayr nahin he
 The hostel has strict rules when it comes to meeting outside people
 aapse milane vahi aa saktaa he jiskaa naam register he
 If someone else comes before you, your parents know that someone came to meet you
 dosti-yarihostel kii yaari-dosti ek aisi cheez he jo aapako har haal main khush rahanaa sikhaa detii he
 This friend remembers your age
 aapke saath rahane vaale hi aapke sabase kareebi ho jaataa he
 Your room partner wipes your tears when you remember the house at night
 kai baar to najaara dekhne laayak hota he
 When the other emotional drama begins to silence one
 dosti-yaari to yahaan aise nibhaai jaati he jaise janmon se ek-duusare ko jaanate hon
 There is a rule to get up and sleep in freedom and pleasure
 jise sabase pehle hostel main aakar students todate hai
 Here the day begins at night and night begins in the day
 ab sawaal ye he ki raat main hota kya he to jawaab main har hostler yahi kahegaa ki gane gaanaa, movie dekhnaa
 Not only this, after eating food at 10 o'clock, it is common to wake up again at 2 o'clock at night and eat some chut-puters
 yahi nahin 'jugad' se chori-chhipe chaay banane kaa bhi apana alag hi majaa hota he

 All Time Alert Every fellow living here gets used to being alert
 aapke paas kitna saamaan he or kaise sambhaal kar rakhana he is baat kaa dhyaan rakhana hota he
 By coming to Money Management Hostel, you learn money management
 sabase badi baat ye he ki achaanak se ehsaas hota he ki har cheez main bade paise kharch hote hai
 That is why hostels do not respond to take a cheap and best route
 vaise, jab bhi bich main jarurat pade aap bade aram se ghar se paise manga sakate hai
 Householders also always send extra money so that you do not have any problem away from home
 hostel ke kapadeis baat ko aapane pehle gaur kiya nahin ho ki ghar se aane se pehle ham kapade puure taur-tareekon se pahante hai
 Coming here makes no sense other than pajama-t-shirt

 During that time, Sharafat leaps so much that just don't ask

 maharashtra sarkaar shina bora hatya maamle main sibiai kii puri madad karegi
 If needed, the officers of the state police who investigate this case will also be deployed to help the CBI
 mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis khud is maamle ko lekar sanjeeda dikh rahe hai
 He made it clear that the matter was serious, so a decision was taken to conduct a probe by the CBI
 gauratlab he ki maharashtra sarkaar neshina bora murder kesaki jaanch ke liye sibiai se anurodh kiya tha
 Admitting that, the CBI has agreed to investigate the matter
 fadanvis ne is baat kii jaankaree media ko khud di
 The chief minister said that he had previously held informal talks with the central government and CBI officials to take up the investigation in the Sheena Bora murder case
 uske baad sibiai ne jaanch apane haath main lene par sahamati jataai
 Fadnavis, who also holds the responsibility of the Home Department, said that the state government decided to conduct an inquiry with the CBI because 'many financial aspects' are involved in this case
 rajya sarkaar ne mahasoos kiya ki sibiai ke liye is cese se jude vibhinn pahaluon kii jaanch karnaa aasaan hoga
 At the same time, he said that if needed, the state government can provide its officers to assist the CBI in the investigation, as it did in the case of the murder of anti-superstition Narendra Dabholkar
 supreme court ke faisle ke baavjood punjab kii purv mukhyamantri rajinder cor bhatthal pichley kai saalon se chandigarh main punjab sarkaar kii taraf se die gaye sarkari bangale main hi rah rahi hai
 The court recently directed the former chief ministers to leave the government Bengali and facilities
 purv mukhyamantri rajinder cor ke sarkari awaas par lagi nem plate main bhi unke naam ke neeche purv mukhyamantri kaa darja likhaa gaya he
 Interestingly, Rajinder Kaur Bhatthal is neither an MLA nor holding any other constitutional post, yet she has been allotted this bungalow as the former Chief Minister of Punjab Government
 'suraksha ke liye sarkari bangala'rajinder cor ke sarkari bangale ko lekar kai baar vipaksh kii ore se bhi sawaal khadey kiye gaye hai lekin bhatthal kaa kahana he ki unhen ye sarkari bangala bataur purv mukhyamantri nahin diya gaya balki aatankwaad ke khatre se bachaane ke liye diya gaya he
 He says that his family has been receiving constant threats from pro-khalistan militants, due to which he has been given this government residence in Chandigarh in view of security
 purv siem ne kaha ki wo sarkaar se sirf is awaas ke taur par suvidha le rahi hai unako kisi cabinet mantri ke baraabar kii suvidhaayen nahin milti hai
 But in reality Rajinder Kaur Bhattal has also been given escort PCR vehicles from the Punjab government and she also has all the facilities like servants and free electricity-telephones in her government bungalow
 haalanki rajinder cor bhatthal kaa kahana he ki agar supreme court ke nirdesh ke baad punjab sarkaar kii taraf se koi notification jari kiya jayega to aise main wo turant is sarkari bangale ko khaali kar dengi
 In Rajasthan, 2 Banglesuprim Court in the name of Raje may have asked the Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh to vacate the bungalow but the Rajasthan government also seems to have no effect on it
 rajasthan main mukhyamantri or purv mukhyamantriyon ke naam se 5 bangale aavantit he
 As the Supreme Court last year asked former Uttar Pradesh Chief Ministers to vacate the bungalow, the Akhilesh government as well as the Vasundhara government also passed a bill to facilitate the bungalow to former chief ministers
 ab ek baar phir se supreme court ne purv mukhyantriyon ko aavantit bangale khaali karne ke liye kaha he to purv mukhyamantri or congress mahasachiv ashok gahalot chitthee likhakar vasundhara sarkaar se apana bangala khaali karne ke liye niyam-kanoon puch rahe hai
 In Rajasthan, when CM Chief Minister Vasundhara became the Leader of the Opposition after losing the election, the bungalow he got as the Leader of the Opposition, he kept the bungalow with him even after becoming the CM
 siem kaa aadhikarik awaas- 13 civil lines tab se khaali padaa he
 That means two bungalows are allotted to the Chief Minister of Rajasthan Vasundhara
 nahin khaali hue sarkari bangalemukhyamantri raaje ke bangale ke thik saamne purv mukhyamantri or congress mahasachiv ashok gahalot ko 42 number kaa bangala purv mukhyamantri kii haisiyat se mila hua he
 Just next to it, a bungalow number 14 is allotted in the name of former Chief Minister and Vice President Bhairo Singh Shekhawat
 isamen unke nidhan ke baad se unke damaad narpat singh rajvi rahete hai jo ki bijepi ke vidhayak bhi hai
 Similarly, a bungalow is also allotted in Jaipur to the former Chief Minister Jagannath Pahadia on Hospital Road
 bijepi ke vidhayak ghanashyam tiwadi kah rahe hai ki congress or bijepi donon bangala lene ke naam par mili hui hai or donon ne milakar bhootpurv banane par apane liye bangala surakshit kar liya he
 According to the bill passed by the Vasundhara government in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly, once the Chief Minister who becomes the Chief Minister, becomes the Governor or the President, nothing remains, yet the Rajasthan Government will give him a bungalow for life
 saath hi cabinet mantri ke jitne staff hote hai utane staff bhi unhen die jaaenge
 The law brought Vasundhara government: The Rajasthan government has filed a petition in the High Court against this bill, hearing is on
 bijepi vidhayak ghanashyam tiwadi ne do-do bangale rakhane par mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke khilaaf andolan kii chetavanee di he
 Though it has been the custom of allotting bungalows to former Chief Ministers in Rajasthan since 1973, but as Chief Minister for the first time in 2010, Ashok Gehlot had announced to give bungalows to former Chief Ministers in the Assembly

 raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne kaha he ki aatankwaad shanti or sadbhaav ke liye sabase bada khatra he, jo simaaon kii parvaah nahin karata or vinaash ko anjaam detaa he
 He said that action should be taken against this problem before it becomes incurable

 Action should be taken against it before it becomes incurable
 ' pratinidhimandal ne shuukravaar ko pranab mukherjee se mulaakaat kii thi
 The need to promote peace, Pranab Mukherjee said, 'india wants more contact between the people of both countries, because it is a strong way to promote peace in both countries
 ''achche padosi sambandh viksit hon'pranab mukherjee ne pakistani seenet ke adhyaksh saiyad naiyar hossain ke netritv vaale pratinidhimandal se kaha ki donon deshon ke nirvaachit pratinidhiyon ko achche padosi sambandh viksit karne ke prayaason main ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaani he
 Pranab Mukherjee told the delegation that India wants friendly and cooperative relations with Pakistan
 hossain ne donon deshon ke bich samvaad bahaali kaa swaagat kiya or kaha ki dwipaksheeya vyapaar se donon deshon ko laabh hoga
 He said, 'pakistan is also facing terrorism

 ' rail bajatmenkirayanaheen badhegaa ye har koi jaanata he
 But is that enough for travelers? kuch nai gaadiyaan, kuch nae root or kuch aisi scimen jinase railway kaa bhala nahin hone vaala
 Will the public be happy with so much? It is obvious that in addition to the right fare, the public wants to get some better facilities in the journey - the trains should run on time and there should be someone accountable for this
 - rail haadason se bachaav ke liye security equipments lagaae jaaen
 - Stop incidents of robbery with passengers in trains
 - steshnon or trainon main saaf-safai ho
 
 - lambii duuri kii trainon main medical suvidhaayen ho
 - There is no food in the trains, which makes us sick
 - First Lalu and now Mamta Dhadhadhad are announcing to start new trains
 lekin nai patariyaan bichaane kii yaad kisi ko nahin he
 By the way, the bigger issue than these expectations is whether Mamta will be able to save the railway from bankruptcy
 lekin ye paise nahin mili mamata kii aguwai main rail kii kamai teji se giri he or kharche bade hanis baat ko aap aise samaj sakate hai ki railway har 100 rupee kamaane ke liye 95 rupee kharch karti he takneekee bhashaa main ise oparating reshio kehete hai- 2007-08 main ye anupaat sau rupee par 76 rupee kaa tha
 For the first time in the history of railways, suppliers have not received payment this year, if Mamta will make any announcement in the budget, then it is not easy to implement it
 In the last budget, she had said to give Rs 11 thousand crore to Kolkata Metro, whereas the reality is that Railways It has a reserve of only 5000 crores
 Obviously, if you do not have much hope in this, then what is good about the Indian Railways, even before that God used to trust, and so on

 hameshaa hi maratha asmita kii baat karne vaali shivasena ab jab satta main he, to ye jaananaa bhi jaruri ho jaataa he ki maharashtra ke teen bade shaharon yani mumbai, nagpur or pune kaa itihaas kitna gauravpurn rahaa he
 Today, even though these cities are counted in modern cities, the pages of history mention them in golden letters
 1
 Mumbai
 
 
 desh kii aarthik rajdhani mumbai jise hindustan kaa aarthik dwaar bhi kaha jaataa he
 It is the capital of Maharashtra and also the stronghold of the Maratha Empire
 mumba devi ke naam par is shahar kaa namakaran hua
 The city was conquered by Muslim invaders in the 13th century, after which it was included in the Gujarat region
 lekin bahadurshah ne is shahar ko waapas portugaliyon ko saunp diya tha, lekin jab british bharat main aae to east india company kaa varchasv bhi shahar par kaaphi rahaa
 Mumbai is called the city of seven islands
 shahar main kolaba, majagaanv, old vuman dweep, vadala, maahim, parel or maatoonga-sayan naam ke tapu hai
 The city was earlier called Bombay, but later became Mumbai
 2
 Pune
 
 
 maharashtra ke bade shaharon main se ek pune kaa marathi itihaas se gaharaa rishta he
 Chhatrapati Shivaji and his successor Shambhaji made this city their capital
 jise dakkan kii rajdhani bhi kaha jaataa tha, unke alaava bajirao peshwa ne bhi apana sthai awaas isi shahar ko banaaya
 Bajirao's fort in Pune is 'shaniwar Wada'
 aaj shivaji park main bhi isi ke aadhaar par manch banaaya ja rahaa he
 Pune may be considered as the center of IT today, but at some time there was a war between the Nizams and Marathas in this city
 bajirao peshwa ke jivan par aadhaarit film ‘bajirao mastaani’ main bhi is kisse kaa zikr kiya gaya he
 3
 nagpur
 
 
 Nagpur, the third major city of Maharashtra, is today known as the 'capital of Oranges'
 devgarh ke shaasha rahe gond vansh ne is shahar kii sthapana kii thi, 19veen sadi tak ye shahar madhya bharat kii rajdhani tha
 But due to the high Maratha population here, this city was included in Maharashtra
 jab british bharat main aae to unhone isemaharashtra kii uparajdhanibanaya tha

 chunaav prakriya par uthaae sawaal, media or nyaaypalika ko bhi nahin bakhsharahul ne bhaajapa or sangh ke saath hi media, nyaaypalika or chunaav ayog par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Rahul surrounded the BJP government by talking about the institution of the country being in the possession of the Union, while speaking about the weakening of democracy, it also gave the message that the Congress is necessary to restore the autonomy of the institutions
 rahul ne bhavishya ke bharat ko dard or hinsa se bharaa bataaya modi ke sabakaa vishwaas ke naare kii hawa bhi nikaali
 Talking about being affected by the most poor and downtrodden sections also aroused fear
 rahul ne chunaav prakriya par sawaal uthaane ke saath hi nyaaypalika or media par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa 
 Raiders will continue on PM Modi, Rahul Gandhi has targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi even while leaving the post of the President of Congress
 rahul ne chunaav jeetne se bhrashtachar ke nahin chhipane kii baat kii
 This is considered to be an indication that he is going to stick to his strategy to target the bjp's biggest leader
 rahul kii chitthee main unke tevar is baat kaa sanket hai ki unhone party ke adhyaksh pad se istipha jarur de diya he, lekin bhaajapa or sangh ke saamne hathiyaar nahin daale hai
 Rahul has also given the message of new Congress, new front and forward fight

" '' Neelkanth mountain is the place where Lord Vishnu sits in the form of Badrinath in the Himalayan mountain ranges
 badrinaath dham bhagwaan vishnu ke tirthasthalon main ek alag sthaan to rakhata hi he saath hi yahaan sthapit bhagwaan badri kii murti bhi anokhi he
 God is usually worshiped in all the Vishnu temples of the world in his standing form, but the Lord's Deity in Badrinath Dham is in the posture of Padmasana
 manyata he, ek baar jab bhagwaan vishnu tapasya main leen the, to unhen kadi dhoop se bachaane ke liye maa lakshmi ber ke vriksh ke rup main unpar tab tak jhuki raheen jab tak wo tapasya karte rahe
 Later, Lord Vishnu, honoring his love and dedication, gave the place the name of Badrinath, because in Sanskrit, Ber is called Badri
 aaj bhi jab koi badrinaath dham kaa uccharan karata he to pehle ‘badri’ yani maa lakshmi kaa naam aata he or baad main ‘nath’ yani bhagwaan vishnu kaa
 Visiting Lord Badrinath is not so easy
 isane darshan se pehle shraddhalu tapt kunda main snaan kar dehashuddhi karte hai or phir lakshmi ji kii puja karke sukh shanti kii kaamana karte hai
 There are many hot water streams near the heated pool, in which medicinal properties are said
 manyata yah bhi he ki yah snaan janm janmantaran ke paapon se chhutkaaraa dilaa detaa he
 It is not easy to see the sight of Lord Badrinarayan, the importance of the Lord's Deity in the visit of Lord Badrinarayan is as important as this holy mountain Neelkanth, because in religious beliefs, it is not only the mountain but the real Shiva and this glory of this region
 Draws devotees from far and wide
 bhagwaan badrinaath sirf garmiyon ke chah maas hi bhakton ko darshan dete hai, baaki ke chah maheene unke kapaat band rahete hai, lekin is dauraan bhi unki vidhi-vidhaan se aradhana hoti he
 It is forbidden for humans to leave
 nishchit hi aap soch rahe honge ki band kapaat ke peeche koun unki puja karata he, to ham aapako bataa den ki sardiyon main badrinaath kii puja kaa adhikaar devataaon or maa lakshmi ke paas chalaa jaataa he, jis pavitra bhoomi par khud narayan virajman hon or jis mandir ko devataaon ne apane haathon se banaaya he, usee pavitra bhoomi or mandir kaa badrinaath he
 There are only 6 months of darshan
 Devotees of this holy abode can be seen only in six months of summer, because the remaining 6 months worship the deity Narayana
 iske peeche kii kahani badi dilachasp he
 It is said that in the Satyuga, Narayana used to reside in Badrikashram
 tretayug main kathor tapasya karne vaale rishi muni hi vishnu ke darshan kar pate the, lekin dwapar yug aane par jab bhagwaan krishnavatar lene ke liye jane lage to na keval rishi muni balki devataaon ko bhi unke darshan durlabh ho gaye
 When the Gods did not get Narayana's vision for a long time, they got nervous and started praying to Vishnu to see him
 tab vishnu ne ek aisa tarika nikaala jisase wo devataaon or manushyon ko samaan rup se darshan de saken, unhen puja or aradhana karne kaa mauka de saken
 Vishnu said that in the Kali Yuga, when a person becomes inferior to religion and pride in him, then he will not be able to live in front of humans
 aisi sthiti main naarad shila ke neeche alaknanda main samaai hue unki ek murti ke jariye wo bhakton ko darshan denge
 Hearing his talk, the gods removed the idol from Naradkund and installed the idol in a temple from Vishwakarma
 is mandir kaa naam badrinath padaa or naarad ko pradhan archak niyukt kiya gaya
 Then a provision was also made that humans would have the right to worship Narayana in Badrinath for 6 months, and for the remaining six months, the deity could worship

 Government land is not available for this rehabilitation

 Despite this, no concrete plan has been made for the displacement of these villages
 niti ayog kii baithak main pichley kai varshon se gaanvon ke punarvaas kaa mudda uthaaya ja rahaa he
 While the government ignores the pain of these villages scattered in the mountains, on the slums of Dehradun, despite the High Court's order, they found their way to their rescue, seeing their numbers and vote bank
 chaar din main hi sarkaar atikaramanakariyon ke saamne ghutane tech cabinet main adhyadesh le ai

 The slum population will be shifted to housing built under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana
 iske alaava land bank banaakar anya jagahon par bhi unke liye awaas banaae jaaenge
 Whereas the Finance Minister of the same government says that a plan is being made with the support of the Center for the displacement and rehabilitation of all the sensitive and vulnerable villages of the mountain

 teen saal baad in bastiyon ko lekar kya kadam uthaaya jayega, yah saaf nahin he
 The government should clear its position on this issue
 bhatta ne kaha ki pradesh main varsh 2013 main ai aapadaa main hue nuksaan ke baad kai gaanvon kaa punarvaas abhi tak nahin hua he
 Bhatt alleges that the drama of bringing an ordinance is being done to save the slipping political ground keeping in mind the upcoming civic elections and Lok Sabha elections in the state

 These days, there is a discussion of a child weighing around six and a half kilos
 karnataka main janmi ye bacchee duniya kii sabase vajani bacchee he lekin kya aapane gaur kiya bacchee kii maa mahaj 19 saal kii hi he
 While the weight of the girl is a world record, the age of her daughter's mother Nandini is also being discussed
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai duniya kii sabase choti maa ne kis umr main bachche ko janm diya tha? aapke liye yakeen karnaa mushkil hoga lekin sachai yahi he ki duniya kii sabase choti maa ne mahaj paanch saal kii umr main bachche ko janm diya tha
 Leena Medina was born on September 27, 1933, in Ticarpo, a small village in Peru
 leena duniya kii sabase kam umr kii documented maa hai
 Lina was born with a rare condition precocious puberty
 ye ek aisi sthiti he jisamen jananaang bahut jaldi viksit ho jate hai
 Development of genitals usually begins in girls at the age of 10 and in boys in 11–12 years, but Lina started having periods from the eighth month
 chaar saal kii umr main hi unke breast puri tarah viksit ho gaye the
 When Lina was five years old, her stomach suddenly started growing
 unki maa victoria ko laga ki unki beti ke pet main tumor ho gaya he
 Or their daughter is possessed by an evil spirit
 wo leena ko lekar aspataal pahunchi
 Lena was examined in the hospital and the result shocked not only the people present but the whole world
 paanch saal kii bacchee, jo khud apni maa ke haath se niwala khaati thi, pregnent thi
 
 
 She was about to give birth to a child
 jis samay leena aspataal pahunchin wo aath maah kii garbhvatee thim
 Doctor Geraldo Lozada took the case of Lina in his hand
 14 may 1939 ko leena ne ek swasth or lagbhag chah pound ke vajan vaale bachche ko janm diya
 The mother's genital size was small, so delivery was done by surgery
 us samay leena kii umr paanch saal saat maheene or 17 din thi
 It was a matter of coincidence that the day Lina became a mother in 1939, Mother's Day was the same day
 leena ke doctor ke sammaan main bachche kaa naam bhi geraldo rakhaa gaya
 This child remained alive till the age of 40, but he died in 1979 due to bone marrow disease
 kai saal tak to geraldo, leena ko apni bahan hi maanate rahe
 But when he was 10 years old, he came to know the truth of his mother
 leena ne kabhi bhi apane bachche ke pita kaa naam nahin bataaya
 Looking at Leena's condition, her father is the only accused
 wo giraftaar bhi hue lekin subooton ke abhaav main unhen chhod diya gaya
 Gone
 vahiin leena se jab bhi is babat poocha jaataa wo shant ho jaati or kuch bhi nahin bolti
 As if he does not know anything
 
 
 yaad hi nahin
 Leena also took care of herself and took full care of her child
 aap bas us bacchee kii sthiti ke bare main sochie jo apane liye kapade nahin chun sakati thi, wo ek bachche ko nappy pahanaati thi
 The mother who used to look at her parents for food and drink, used to give milk to her child
 khayr samay beetaa or leena ne doctor lojada kii clinics main hi naukari kar lee
 It is the doctor who took care of Lina's studies and her son's studies
 saal 1972 main leena ne rol jurado naam ke ek shaks se shaadi kar lee or wo apane pati ke saath lima main rahane lageen
 Even though the world knows the name of Leena, but Leena herself does not like to talk about it
 unhone kisi bhi tarah kaa public intervyuu dene se saaf manaa kar diya or us ek sawaal par aaj bhi unki chuppi kaayam he
 
 
 Anandi Ben Patel assumed power in Gujarat after Narendra Modi became Prime Minister
 unke shasankaal par pehali baar sawaal tab uthe jab hardik patel ne 25 agast 2015 ko gujarat sarkaar ke khilaaf raily kii
 When Hardik united with 5 lakh Patels in Ahmedabad to demand reservation for the Patidars, the Gujarat government was blown away
 andolan hinsak hua or phir centre ke dakhal ke baad maamla shant bhi hua, lekin is andolan ne rajya main ek nai raajnneetik rekha khinch di
 Remember, when the Patidars movement turned violent in Gujarat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had to appeal to the people for peace from Delhi to overcome the situation
 lekin piem modi kii apil ke baad bhi halaat kaabo main nahin aae
 After this, the situation was controlled after the arrest of Hardik Patel for treason
 maujuuda halaat kaa 2017 ke chunaav par asarpatidaaron ke andolan ke baad pichley saal sthaniyanikaay ke chunaavamein bijepi ko shaharon main badhat mili, lekin gramin kshetro main congress ne jis tarah se nattejey dekhne ko mili uske baad piem narendra modi or bijepi kendriya netruv chintaae badhanaa laazmi tha
 The BJP has not yet fully emerged from the defeats in the Delhi and Bihar Legislative Assemblies
 aise main piem narendra modi kii chintaa is baat ko lekar he ki jis tarah kii raajnneetik sthiti is vakt gujarat main bani hui he, iskaa asar 2017 main gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey main jarur dikhaai degaa
 The report prepared by Om Prakash Mathur is the reason why PM Narendra Modi got his confidant in Gujarat and former in-charge of Gujarat Om Prakash Mathur got a report on the political situation in Gujarat
 om maathur ne apni report 25 april ko narendra modi or amit shah ko saunpi thi
 Last week, Amit Shah called a meeting of all Gujarat mps and BJP leaders and discussed the current political situation
 is vakt gujarat ke prabharee dinesh sharma, gujarat bijepi ke adhyaksh vijay roopani ne pradhanmantri narendra modi se bhi mulaakaat kii thi, jiske baad gujarat main raajnneetik halchal bad gai he
 Om Prakash Mathur said -1 in his report
 hamen patidaaron kaa andolan nazarandaaj nahin karnaa chahie
 2
 rajya sarkaar or party main gutbaji ko khatm karnaa chahie
 3
 rajya sarkaar main kai bade badlaav karne honge
 4
 sarkaar or party ke bich main samanvay kii kami ko jaldi se jaldi dur karnaa hoga
 5
 sarkaar ke faislon main party kii bhagidaari ko badhanaa hoga
 6
 kendriya netruv ko samay-samay par party or sarkaar ke kaamkaaj kii samiksha kerani chahie
 It is said that only after this report of Om Mathur, after the advice of PM Modi and Amit Shah, the state government passed the law of reservation for forward castes in government jobs
 iske tahat jin pariwaron kii salanaa aayaa chah lakh rupee se kam he, unke liye 10 fisadi aarakshan kii vyavastha kii gai
 Shah and Modi's meeting with the leaders of Gujarat was not the same, only after the report, BJP President Amit Shah increased the number of visits in Gujarat
 party ke netaaon or mantriyon sang baithak shuru kar di
 PM Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and Om Prakash Mathur have had twice-long meetings in a week
 shuukravaar ko bhi om prakaash maathur ne piem se gujarat ke vishay par sansad main mulaakaat kii
 Gujarat Health Minister Nitin Patel has also held separate meetings with PM Narendra Modi and Om Mathur
 sutara bataate hai ki gujarat kii raajnneetik paristhiyon par report ko dekhte hue piem narendra modi bada faisla bhi le sakate hai
 The possibility is also being expressed that the command may be handed over to another leader by removing Anandi Ben Patel from the post of Chief Minister
 CM pad se hataai ja sakati hai anandi ben patelis saal november maheene main anandi ben patel 75 saal kii ho jaaengi
 Gujarat also has assembly elections in November 2017
 aise main anandi ben patel ke netruv main chunaav main utarana phayda kam or nuksaan zyada karvaa saktaa he
 There is also a discussion that Patel may be appointed as Governor of Haryana or Punjab
 apni chhavi ko lekar modi samvedansheelpiem modi bhi jaanate hai ki gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main agar galati se haar ho gai to unki leadership par sawaal khadey ho jaaenge
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, it would be such a big shock for Modi that it would be difficult for both him and the party to recover
 vaise bhi piem modi ke liye kaha jaataa he ki wo apni image ko lekar bahut samvedansheel rahete hai

 india today ke anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne apni padtaal main paaya ki video main kiya gaya daawa puri tarah galat he
 Actually, this video is not of Kalyanpur in Rajasthan but of St
 Katrina in Brazil
 AFWA padtalavideo main boli ja rahi bhashaa se andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki ye kisi anya desh kii he
 When we did a reverse search with the help of invid Tool, a news article in Portuguese language
 ye artical is saal 27 navambar ko prakashit hua
 On translating the article, it was found that the man seen in the video was torturing his own daughters to take revenge on his ex-wife
 utyub par isse judi khabar ko search karne par hamenek purtagali news videomila, jiske mutabik apni betiyon ko apamaanit or pratadit karne vaale is pita ko police ne giraftaar kar liya tha
 According to media reports, the man seen in the video is named Carlos Aimer
 yahaan par ye baat saaf ho jaati he ki yah video brazil kaa hi he or iskaa bharat se koi lenaa dena nahin
 In Madhya Pradesh, the government is going to take a more strict stand on synthetic milk, mawa and cheese
 lok swasthya evam parivaar kalyaan mantri tulsi silavat ne shuukravaar ko kaha he ki doodh or doodh se bane padaarthon or khaane pine kii anya chizon main milawat karne waalon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 In this meeting through video conferencing, Health Minister Tulsi Silavat instructed the police and administration officials at the district level to take action against adulterants, if necessary, district authorities should take action against adulterants so that people are afraid of adulteration
 swasthya mantri ne kaha ki milavatkhoron ke khilaaf sakht karrwai karne vaale adhikariyon / karmchaariyon ko sangrakshan diya jayega
 Let us tell you that earlier, after getting synthetic milk mawa and paneer in Bhind Morena and Gwalior, the Health Minister had spoken against such traders under the National Security Act (rasuka)
 darasal rakshabandhan se hindu dharm ke pramukh tyoharon kii shuruyaat ho jaaegi
 The series of festivals will last for several months
 is dauraan bade paimaane par doodh, khoa, paneer or ghi kii khapat hogi
 Keeping this in mind, adulterants had made preparations, but STF is constantly taking action on them
 madhya pradesh main beete 10 dinon main itane bade paimaane par milavati doodh or usase bane utpaadon kii baramadagi ho chuki he ki khud mukhyamantri kamalnath ko is bare main twit karke yah kahana padaa ki vah nijee taur par aise maamalon par najar rakh rahe hai
 In the meeting, Principal Secretary, Public Health and Family Welfare Department Pallavi Jain Govil told that soon Food Testing Laboratory will be set up in Jabalpur and Gwalior, which will reduce the time taken to test samples
 uttar pradesh main bijepi kii apratyaashit jeet se bihar ke mahagathbandhan main ghamaasan much gaya he
 RJD National Vice President Raghuvansh Prasad Singh has openly targeted Nitish Kumar
 uttar pradesh main secular partiyon kii haar kaa thikra raghuvansh prasad nitish kumaar par phodna chaahate hai
 He says that the split of secular votes in UP is due to Nitish Kumar
 unhone yahaan tak kaha ki iskaa asar bihar kii raajnneeti par bhi padegaa
 JDU has reacted strongly to the statement of Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, and demanded that he be removed from the party, but the RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav is silent on this
 is par upmukhyamantri or lalu prasad yadav ke putr tejasvi yadav ne kaha ki argedy raghuvansh prasad singh ke bayaan kaa samarthan nahin karti he
 Tejashwi attacked Raghuvansh Prasad directly and said that he is the vice president of the party and that he should not make such a statement while keeping the dignity of the party
 aise bayanon se bijepi ko phayda hoga or mahagathbandhan kamjor hoga
 Advising not to make a statement against the grand alliance, Yadav said that RJD mlas should guard against making statements against the grand alliance as the grand alliance is made up of the people's mandate
 wo apni vyaktigat raay de sakate hai, lekin ise party ke najariye se nahin dekhnaa chahie
 Tejashwi warned that if such a statement was given further, the party would not refrain from taking action
 agali baar koi aisa bayaan aata he, to rashtriya adhyaksh se sakht karrwai kii apil kii jaaegi
 Nitish Kumar will remain Bihar Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav has ever stayed in the RJD and now also took a dig at bjp's Union Minister Ramkripal Yadav and said, "why do BJP people do this, we all know that
" wo modi ji kii tarah news main rahanaa pasand karte hai or kuch naa kuch drama karte rahete hai
 Their position is critical in the Lok Sabha constituency, which is why they are adopting such weapons
 aise logon se sabhi ko sachet rahane kii jarurat he
 'tejashwi further said that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is there, there should be no doubt in this
 upi main bhi hona chahie tha mahagathbandhantejasvi ne kaha ki bihar kii dharti par bijepi auraresaiska jhanda marate dam tak nahin lahraane denge
 Even if Nitish ji goes to the election campaign or not, the news is made
 chunaav parinaam se humlog dukhi jarur hai, lekin log girakar hi uthte hai
 Every time it was said that the RJD would end in Bihar, but the RJD has again come back strongly in Bihar as a single largest party
 ab ye saaf ho gaya he ki bihar main jaisaa mahagathbandhan kiya gaya, vaise hi upi main mayawati or akhilesh ji ko mulaakaat kerani chahie thi
 If we had formed an alliance, there would have been more than 305 seats
 bijepi ko agar rokna he, desh ko bachaana he, to sabko apana ahankaar chhodkar ek hona padegaa
 The Bihar government can fall anytime
 On the other side, BJP is enjoying the rhetoric going on between the RJDU and the RJD
 vidhansabha main pratipaksh ke netaa prem kumaar kaa kahana he ki upi main bijepi kii baari jeet kii vajah se mahagathbandhan bikharaav kii ore bad rahaa he
 This government aboard three boats will not be able to complete its tenure
 samay se pehle bihar main chunaav kii sambhaavna ban rahi he, jo bayaan aa rahe hai, usase aapasi matbhed dikh rahaa he
 Government can fall anytime in Bihar

 But former Pakistan Test captain Rameez Raja has advised the PCB not to allow these three to return to the national team
 raja ne kaha, 'pisibi unhen kuch gharelu cricket khilne kii sweekruti de saktaa he or vittiya taur par unki madad kar saktaa he lekin unhen dobaaraa pakistan kaa pratinidhitiv karne kii sweekruti nahin milani chahie

 dilli ke schuli bacchon ke bare main, ames se karaae gaye hamaare apane adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki lagbhag ek-chauthai bacchon kaa vajan unke liye sujhaaye gaye adarsh vajan se zyada he
 It is undeniably a symbol of economic growth in India
 ab jab kam-se-kam samrudh virgon ke liye khaadya prachur maatra main uplabdh he, or saath hi dainandin gatividhiyon main kharch hone vaali urja main kami aa gai he-urja ke santulan main aayaa badlaav bahut vyapak he
 Extremely severe endocrine and genetic defects (which are a small fraction of this class), increased calorie consumption, decreased physical activity, dramatic increases in sedentary activities (including working on computers and playing, watching television)
 , And rapid socio-economic and nutritional changes with easy access to consumable and energy-saving consumer goods - all contribute to this problem o bachche kaa vajan zyada hona maatr ek dikhaave kaa mudda he yaa isamen kuch or bhi he? durbhagyapurna sach yah he ki bachapan main sthool kaaya ke mahatvapurn swasthya prabhaavon ko abhi chikitsakeey varg ke bheetar bhi vishwa str par sweekaara janaa baaki he
 If we examined more than 500 heavy children in Delhi, 10 percent had abnormalities in glucose metabolism (1 percent of children had obvious diabetes), 2 in every five children had abnormal cholesterol levels
 3,000 bacchon ke bich ek or bade adhyayan main phir in aankadon kii pushti hui-jinamein isi anupaat main bacchon kaa cholesterol badha hua paaya gaya
 a clear majority were those with high levels of 'bad cholesterol' (LDL) and low levels of 'good cholesterol' (HDL)
 bachapan kaa motopa vayask avasthaa ke motaape ko or usase jude tamaam khataron ko janm detaa he
 But even before that, childhood obesity has an impact on health at the same time - diabetes, elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure, fatty liver DI
 jeej or sambhawatah bahut vyapak manovaigyanik-saamaajik jatiltaayen (jinhen naapnaa kathin he, lekin ve utani hi gambhir hai)
 Studies in developed countries have found childhood obesity to be clearly linked to school slipping and unhealthy or risky behaviors, including alcohol and tobacco use
 bachapan or tarunai main motopa dhamniyon main vasa jamane kii prakriya (atheroslerosis) ko shuru kar detii he or yah vayaskon main cardiovescular kaarnon se hone vaali mauton se judaa hua he
 Lung diseases such as asthma and exhalation during sleep are found more in obese children
 jahaan motopa calories ke zyada upbhog ko darshata he, vahiin aise bacchon main kai sookshm poshakon-visheshkar aayran or vitamin di- ke abhaav janit rog aam hote hai
 An additional problem, often seen in low- and middle-income countries such as India, is that children who are underweight at birth tend to gain weight rapidly during childhood and adolescence
 yah baat ab spasht taur par diabetes, ucch raktchaap, cholesterol kii aniyamittaaon or chayapachay kii anya gadabadiyon se judi dekhi gai he
 a study based on a group of 40-year-olds in South Delhi shows what are the effects of the shift from low birth weight to increased weight in young women
 is samasya se nibatane kii sarvshereshth ranneeti kya ho, yah ek ulajhaa hua prashn he
 The ideal way would be to not let the weight gain
 lekin aisa kahana saral he, karnaa kathin
 Rescue has to be done on many levels - individuals, families, schools and communities
 haalanki bachche ko paraamarsh dena mahatvapurn he, ghar or skool kii pahal nirnaayak he
 Parents should be encouraged to give appropriate doses to children and encourage physical activity in them
 or unhen yah bhi sunishchit karnaa hoga ki is salaah ko ghar ke sabhi sadsy maanate hon
 If the child finds that the other members of the house are free from all this 'strictness' imposed on him, then it does not help
 skool main ek 'swasthkar' parivesh bhi utana hi mahatvapurn he, jisamen sujhaaye gaye khadyon ko hi 'tiffin' main laayaa jaae or khelkud kii paryaapt suvidhaayen hon
 at's parents are dragging her to nutritionists, and personal trainers, from swimming to aerobic classes
 lekin bachche kaa apana utsaah agar tha, to bhi simit hi
 Fortunately, there were no specific disturbances in his metabolic measurement
 hamane doctoron or poshan visheshgyon ke saath baar-baar kii baatcheet karwaane kaa ek sudeergh or shaniah shaniah hastekshap kaa kaarykram shuru kiya, jisamen bacchee ko apane vichaar vyakt karne ke liye protsaahit kiya jaataa tha
 When coordination and trust was established between the child and her medical team, the girl started a self-motivated and self-designed program to lose weight
 ek varsh main usne vajan kam kar liya or ab vah ek durust, urjavan, shaareerik taur par daksh or daud-bhaag karti 12 varsh kii bacchee he
 Unfortunately, other children are often not as lucky

 Currently, CBI is investigating allegations of horse trading and money transactions in Jharkhand in the March 30 Rajya Sabha election
 in aaropon ke kaaran chunaav ayog ko yah chunaav radd karnaa padaa tha
 It is expected that the country's top investigating agency will file a charge sheet in the next three months
 haalanki mandal jharkhand ke un 15 vidhayakon main se ek hai, jo sibiai jaanch ke daayre main hai
 He has caused embarrassment to himself and the party, which is due to the finding of unaccounted cash and stolen land deals from his house
 haalanki bhaajapa ne unase abhi tak koi safai nahin maangi he
 The CBI has also searched the house of Jharkhand's Labor and Employment Minister Chandraprakash Chaudhary, besides the remaining 14 mlas
 mana jaataa he ki vahaan se aisi koi suchi mili he, jisamen vidhayakon ke naam ke aage bahut badi rakam likhi hui he
 Chaudhary's success story is quite interesting in itself
 ateet main koyala vyapaaree rahe choudhary ne 2005 main pehali baar vidhansabha kaa chunaav ladaa tha, or tab se ve hameshaa upie or rajg donon sarkaron main mantri rahe hai
 In October 2009, Income Tax Department officials deposited Rs 12 crore in the bank account of Chaudhary's personal assistant Manoj Singh
 se adhik kii rakam hone kaa bhandaphod kiya tha
 Despite this seizure, Chaudhary's hair was also not deterred, as the investigations initiated by the Income Tax Department and the State Vigilance Bureau have failed to reach any conclusion in the last three years

 After seizing the ballot for the canceled election, the CBI has apparently raided the bases of mlas who voted in favor of Independent candidate Pawan Kumar Dhoot
 kai vidhayakon ne apni duusari variyata kaa vot dhoot ke paksh main daalaa tha, haalanki bhaajapa or congress donon partiyon ne apane vidhayakon ko aisa karne se manaa kiya tha
 Dhoot, a businessman from Bengal, is believed to have received the second highest number of votes in the canceled election
 iskaa matlab he ki agar jharkhand ke chunaav radd nahin kiye gaye hote, to rajyasabha siton main se ek seat par dhoot jeet jate
 In connection with the canceled election, the CBI has conducted raids at the residence of Dhoot and the Ranchi residence of former BJP MP Ajay Maru
 ateet main lambey samay tak jharkhand ke kai vidhayakon ne rajyasabha chunaav ko motaa paisa kamaane kaa jariya bana rakhaa tha
 In the Rajya Sabha elections held in 2008 and 2010, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and bjp's authorized candidates lost the elections and the out-of-state businessmen - Parimal Nathwani and Kanwar Deep Singh - won from Jharkhand
 lekin sibiai ke haal hi main maare gaye chhaapon se un vidhayakon ke liye samasya kii shuruyaat ho gai he, jo 'antaratma kii aawaaj par vot' daalane ke aadi rahe hai or jinhen ab sibiai kaa kanoonee taur par muqabla karnaa hoga

 lekin dhoot unase bhi bade khilaadi ke taur par ubhare hai, jo jaahir taur par chune jane ke liye jaruri sankhya main vidhayakon ko apane paksh main karne main safal rahe the
 The CBI is now trying to prove whether Dhoot offered to give them cash in lieu of the votes received

 Although all these SIM cards were destroyed on 30 March, CBI has been successful in extracting information about calls and SMS sent from these numbers
 sibiai ko pataa chalaa he ki 10 sim card kharidne main ranchi ke mander ke rahane vaale yaku ba ali kii pahchaan kaa istemaal kiya gaya or in sim cardon kaa istemaal dhoot kii rajyasabha main pahunchane kii hasaraton ko puraa karne ke liye paison ke len-dein kii khatir kiya gaya

 The Kejriwal government is finding it difficult to spend the entire budget of Delhi this year
 sarkari aankadon ko maane to janvari ke aakhir tak sarkaar ne alag-alag project ke liye tay kiye gaye bajet se aadha bhi kharch nahin kiya he
 The big thing is that in the education and health budget, the biggest claims were made, less than half of the budget has been spent
 kharch karne ke liye sarkaar ke paas mahaj do maheene kaa vakt bachaa he
 Displeased with the lack of central assistance, the question is emerging in the minds of the people of Delhi whether work is going on in this government or not? The Kejriwal government has about half the budget till just a few days before the end of the financial year
