 ''input - ieenes Union minister Anupriya Patel's party Apna Dal (S) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance was almost ready
 beete maheene 10 janvari tak mana ja rahaa tha ki bhaajapa jald hi apana dal (es) ke saath uttar pradesh main siton ke bantwaare kaa elaan kar sakati hai

 is kaarykram main mukhya atithi patel thim, jo mirzapur loksabhaa kshetra se saansad hai or kendriya swasthya rajya mantri bhi hai
 But surprisingly, no BJP MLA was involved in the program while there are 4 BJP mlas in Mirzapur
 patel ne samuhik vivaah kaarykram se bhaajapa ko kadave bol kahe
 Patel slammed the BJP mlas as they kept away from the public about the policies of the government
 bhaajapa ke virodh ko lekar unhone kaha 'maine bhaajapa ko 20 farvari tak kaa ultimatum de diya he agar hamaari baat nahin suni yaa maani gai to saath rah paanaa mushkil hoga
 'the party has put its point on the appropriate forum, says Anupriya, now the BJP has to decide what the BJP wants
 patel ne maang kii he ki apana dal (es) party ko uttar pradesh rajya cabinet main seat milani chahie
 His argument was that when Suhail Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) despite having four mlas, could be given a cabinet seat, Apna Dal (S) has 9 mlas, so why not make it a cabinet chair? Obviously, Patel is such She wants to increase pressure on BJP through statements
 jisase rajya main cabinet seat or loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye zyada seat mil sake
 In the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, Apna Dal (S) had fielded candidates in 11 assembly seats and won 9 of them

 Was 45 percent
 haari hui siton par bhi apana dal (es) sirf 1

 pratappur main apana dal (es) ne 31
 The BSP accounted for 33 per cent of the votes, while the BSP 32
 63 fisadi vot ke saath jeet hasil karne main kaamyaab rahi
 Apparently, due to such a large share in the vote share, the importance of Apna Dal (S) remains for the BJP

 The debate of individualism has started back about BJP because of Narendra Modi
 waapas kehane se meraa matlab or makasad saaf he ki ye bahes koi nai nahin he
 Like any other political party, the Bharatiya Janata Party also contested many elections keeping its top leader or face in front
 iskaa sabase bada udhaaharan hai atal bihari vaajapeyi
 In 1995, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was declared the Prime Ministerial candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar banane main asafal sabit hue or bijepi ne pehali baar satta kii surat dekhi bhi, to sirf 13 dinon ke liye
 But these same Atal Bihari Vajpayee gave the BJP a government of more than 6 years and a successful alliance of NDA
 vaajapeyi kaa kad or vyaktitv itnaa bada ho gaya ki lagaataar yah kaha jane laga ki ek achhut bijepi se 27 partiyon tak kaa yah jo gathbandhan bana yah sirf vaajapeyi ke naam par hi sambhav tha
 If we turn around today by turning the needle of time, was it not individualism? is endie ke raaj main vaajapeyi or adwani to apane sheersh par rahe, lekin bijepi kaa sanghathan chalaanevaale party ke adhyaksh badalte rahe
 At this time both the shadow and influence of Vajpayee and Advani were very strong on both the party and the government
 13 oktober 1999 ko laalkrishna adwani ko up−pradhanmantri pad de diya gaya, jabaki sarkaar kii shuruyaat main vah grahamantri banaae gaye the
 Wasn't that individualism? Regarding the situation of Narendra Modi in the last three governments in Gujarat, it has always been said that Modi is not BJP but Gujarat
 kya ye vyaktvaad nahin? Therefore, speaking of ideology, the Sangh's statement that we do not lean towards individualism seems very strange to the realm of politics of BJP
 main yah bhi saaf kar dena chahta hum ki sangh pehali baar yah baat nahin kah rahaa, balki bahut pehle se kahata aayaa he
 But the problem is that it is rarely seen in bjp's decisions

 Bihar seems to have become accustomed to one scandal after another, and if seen, the big fishes responsible for the scam are not always able to catch up to a great extent
 saal dar saal, bihar vittiya gadabadiyon or aniyamittaaon ke maamalon ke chalate surkhiyon main bana rahata he
 But this case — if it meets the conditions of being called a scam — can be overshadowed by all due to its sheer size and scale
 badtar yah ki yah aniyamitata aise samay hui he jab bihar kii bagdor nitish kumaar ke haath main he, jinhen ek aise tejatarraar raajnneetijna ke rup main pahachaanaa jaataa he jiske paas anubhav he or is tarah kii aniyamittaaon se nibatane kii prashasnic samaj bhi
 The current controversy has emerged from the Comptroller and Auditor General's (CAG) report, in which the amount of Rs 11,412 crore was wrongly levied by the government exchequer in the period from April 1, 2002 to March 31, 2008
 nikaale jane kii ore ishaara kiya gaya he
 On 15 July, the Patna High Court ordered a CBI inquiry into the matter with reference to these facts

 That is, until the High Court takes a decision on the interlocutory petition of the Bihar government, there will be no CBI inquiry

 It is the amount that was paid to various government officials but mandatory detailed contingency (DC) bills were not deposited on these payments
 is tarah kii aniyamitataayen manaregaa or mid-de mile skim sareekhe vikaas kaaryakramon se sambandhit hai
 For so many years, government officials working at different levels and places in various departments kept withdrawing money from the development fund on the basis of a brief contingency (AC) bill

 The CAG report was tabled in the state assembly on July 14, 2009, but it would be ironic that the state government did nothing against these payments without any details or say, in the direction of correcting things during the last one year Neither took any step
 yah maamla philhal vidhansabha kii lok lekha samiti ke paas he

 sarkaar ne yah bhi tark diya he ki lambit padey disi bill aniyamittaaon kii shrenee main nahin aate hai kyonki asi bilon ke nimitt nibatara ek nirantar chalane vaali prakriya he
 Looking beyond these arguments, the present case puts the Nitish government in the category of other predecessor governments, pursuing morality
 hameshaa atmaprashansa main gale tak dubi rahane vaali sarkaar kharaab vittiya prabandhan se apana pallaa aasaani se nahin jhad sakati
 This controversy, based on the facts of the CAG, is a big setback for the Nitish government
 rajya sarkaar ne yah tark bhi diya he ki vibhinn rajya sarkaron or centre sarkaar kii kuch shakhaon main bhi disi bill lambit paae gaye hai
 For example, 9,789 of the Central Health Department
 14 karod ru
 DC bills are also pending
 lekin yahaan yah baat khaas he ki bihar ke sarkari adhikariyon ne bihar tregeri code kii sthapit prakriyaaon kii baari andekhi kii he
 The rule associated with this process is very simple: DC bill should be given after AC bill which should contain a voucher related to that expenditure and it should also be signed by senior officer
 lekin kya yah accounting sambandhi laaparvaahee kaa ek sidhaa-sada maamla he? yaa phir is gadabadi kii or bhi koi hakeekat he? philhal to visheshgy bhi kisi nishkarsh par pahunchane main aksham hai lekin aise kuch nishchit sanketak hai jo kuch to abhas dete hi hai
 Although the CAG report has also accused Nitish Kumar's predecessors, his government is in the news because of the huge amount of money withdrawn during his tenure and the number of DC bills not deposited in lieu of it
 2002-03 se asi bilon ke evaj main nikaali gai raashi main ekadam se oochaal ai he jise ek had tak to samaj ja saktaa he
 But the fact that cut this argument also exists, that the unadjusted amount has also increased during this period
 yahaan aasaan-si baat jaahir hoti he ki jitani badi raashi nikaali gai, utani hi kam rashiden jamaa karai gayi
 Unadjusted amount has seen steady growth
 2002-03 main jo asmyojit raashi 324
 20 crores Rs
 thi vah 2007-08 main 12 guna badhkar 3,810
 84 crores Rs
 par pahunch gai
 In 2007-08, various departments of the government paid 3,860 against 7,081 AC bills
 47 karod ru
 Had claimed the expense of
 lekin jab baat is kharch ko sahi tehraane kii ai to sarkaar ne sirf 49
 63 crores Rs
 kii laagat vaale 228 vistrut aakasmik bill hi jamaa karaae
 If it is judged by any scale, it is a huge amount and it cannot be ignored
 sattarudh rajg gathbandhan ne ise maatr bilon ke samaayojan or kharch kaa hisaab dene main asafalataa kaa maamla bataaya
 On the other hand, through this issue, the opposition is showing extreme rage to disturb the NDA
 haalanki ise abhi ekadam se ghotaale kaa naam nahin diya gaya he lekin sieji ne apni report main daawa kiya he ki vishaal lok nidhi se jude disi bill jamaa karaae bina use yun hi lambey samay tak latakaae rakhana bahut badi ''gambhir vittiya anushaasanheenata / aniyamitata'' ko janm de saktaa he
 The CAG has gone a step ahead and asked Bihar to implement the Andhra Pradesh government's formula, where if the first AC bill is not dealt with, the amount cannot be withdrawn from the Public Fund through the third AC bill
 sieji report ne saaf taur par vivaadon ke pitare ko khol kar rakh diya he
 However, irregularities are not limited to ddos
 yahi nahin, rajkosh ke adhikariyon kii bhi khinchaai ho sakati he ki unhone purv main kiye gaye bhugtan ke liye upyog praaanpatr liye bina hi kis tarah duusare purv bhugtan kar die
 Even more important is that can we forgive the Nitish government for allowing the bureaucrats to fly the flag of audit rules? Is it possible that the government remains completely oblivious? Or, is it a matter of government being deceived in trust? Now there is a plethora of facts that will make it difficult for even the passionate supporters of the NDA to defend the government
 jaahir he, sarkaar itane bade str par anjaam di gai aniyamittaaon se puri tarah to bekhbar nahin rahi hogi
 Not only this, the internal audit wing of the state government has also previously spoken of such disturbances by the drawing and disbursing officers
 jis avadhi ke liye rajya sarkaar ke auditoron ne prashnchinh lagaaya tha vah 1989-90 se 2004-05 tak kaa kaal tha
 This time the shocking fact has come out that the Bihar government has given an opportunity to spread these irregularities
 kya bihar main sushasan kaa daawa karne vaali sarkaar ko atirikt rup se saavdhaan nahin hona chahie tha kyonki rajya pehle se hi ghotaalon ke liye kukhyat rahaa he? udhaaharan ke liye, baadh ghotaalaa jisamen baadh raahat kaary ke liye jari fund main gadabadi kii gai
 This was revealed when the vouchers issued in lieu of AC bills were investigated
 ise lekar diya jane vaala aamayaham tark yah ho saktaa he ki audit sambandhi kai aapattiyaan jaanch karne ke liye kaaphi jatil ho sakati hai
 In 2006, Mahendra Prasad Gupta, another advocate of the High Court, sought judicial intervention by filing a PIL seeking information about the embezzlement amount - according to state government auditors, the amount was about Rs 1,700 crore
 kii thi
 Later in 2008, the High Court disposed of the petition after the State Government submitted action report and the Government's promise to take appropriate action on the amount of disturbances
 yahaan prashn paidaa hota he ki rajya sarkaar kis prakaar sieji kii aapattiyon ko nazarandaaj kar sakati he, jabaki ateet main bhi vah rajya ke auditoron dwaara pesh kii gai aniyamittaaon ko dur karne kaa vaada kar chuki he
 However, in the past too, the NDA government of Bihar has lodged firs against the ddos on charges of grabbing government money in different cases
 is pariprekshya main dekhen to yah sochane ke liye majaboor hona padataa he ki sieji dwaara vartmaan main pesh kiye gaye tathyon ko aakhir kis tarah nazarandaaj kiya ja saktaa he jabaki ateet main aise maamalon main praathmiki darj ho chuki he? bihar sarkaar sabak seekhney se inkaar kar chuki he
 The CAG report says that it had sold 3,849 in March 2007 alone
 30 karod ru
 2,375 out of the total expenditure of Rs
 04 karod ru
 Brief contingencies were drawn on the bill
 jaahir taur par aisa vitt varsh ke ant par fund ko bekaar na hone dene ke liye kiya gaya
 However, this made the purpose of audit and account rules redundant
 aise main rajya agenciyaan kya kar rahi hai? lok janashakti party ke pramukh ramvilas paswan kehete hai, ''yah to upree akalan he kyonki rajya kii agenciyaan maamle kii tah tak nahin ja saktin
 This requires a central investigation
 ''spasht he ki vidhansabha chunaav sir par hai jisase rajya main raajnneetik sargharmiyaan tej hai lekin bihar vidhansabha main haal main najar aayaa najaara sieji report ko lekar paidaa hue vivaad kaa hi nateeja tha
 The opposition parties of Bihar, who were not yet able to respond to Nitish's tricks, took the issue in stride
 iskaa udhaaharan rajya vidhansabha main mangalvaar or buudhvaar ko pesh aayaa najaara tha
 These two days will be recorded in black letters in the history of Bihar Legislative Assembly
 jabardast hangaame or anya vivaadaaspad sthitiyaan paidaa hone ke baad vipaksh ke 67 vidhayakon ko nilambit kar diya gaya or vidhansabha se uthaakar baahar kar diya gaya
 RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, who was at the forefront of seeking political interest from this controversy, said, "when the 2006 CAG report showed irregularities, why did the Bihar government not act on its own? Nitish Kumar should resign from the post till the CBI probe is completed
 '' is sab bich nitish kumaar ne patrakaron se baatcheet main is maamle par koi bhi baat karne se inkaar karte hue kaha ki court se baahar is masale par baat karnaa sahi nahin hoga
 He quipped on the opposition's demand for resignation, saying, "his happiness will be momentary
" '' beshak nitish ne bahaduree bhare shabd kahe
 But the eagerness with which his government opposed the CBI inquiry indicates that he knows what kind of damage the CAG controversy could cause him in the upcoming election

 lekin aisa lagata he ki chunavi varsh main paidaa hue is nae vivaad ne unke liye ek or morcha taiyaar kar diya he, jis par unhen dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 Yadav said that the solidarity of all like-minded opposition parties at the national level is a serious challenge, but this challenge is not impossible

 Explain that Inspector General of Rajasthan Police (IG) Prashakha Mathur had informed NDTV that the process is going on for 5000 posts of Rajasthan Police Constable and a notification regarding this recruitment will be released soon
 haalanki abhi sirfadesh jari hua he lekin jald hibhartee kaa detail notification bhi jari kar diya jayega
 More information regarding recruitment is given below
 Rajasthan Police Recruitment Notice: yahaan padhein order The government today approved amendments to the existing Negotiable Instruments Act-1881 to increase the credibility of checks as a medium of financial transactions and to help small and medium scale units affected by check-bounce cases
 ab adaalatein peedit paksh ko antarim muaavja dilaa sakengi
 Sources said, the government will make such a provision through amendment of this law that during such cases, the courts may issue orders for payment of interim compensation to the aggrieved party against those who write the check
 sutron ke anusaar sarkaar ne apiliy str par bhi aisa praavdhaan kaa prastaav kiya he ki apiliy adaalat check likhane vaale apilkarta ko sunwaayee adaalat dwaara tay muaavje kaa ek hissaa apil daakhil karne ke samay hi jamaa karne kaa aadesh kar sake
 The amendment can be introduced only in the current winter session of Parliament
 vidhi mantri ravi shankar prasad ne mantrimandal kii baithak main kiye gaye faislon kii jaankaree dete hue kaha ki negoshiable instruments act -1881 main sanshodhan kii manjuuri de di gai he
 However, he did not provide details
 tippaniyan According to sources, the government believes that small and medium-sized units suffer a lot of hassle and loss of business in the pending period due to lack of sufficient money in the account of the checkwriter or due to other reasons
 samajha jaataa he ki sarkaar is bare main sarv saadhaaran or vyavsaayik samudaay se mili sujhaavon ke aadhaar par ‘negoshiable instruments adhinium 1881’ main sanshodhan kara kar peedit paksh ke liye mukademe or apil donon charan main antarim kshatipurti kaa praavdhaan karnaa chaahati he
 a common complaint before the government is that unscrupulous people resort to check bounce tactics to delay payment
 check bouns hone par peedit paksh ko apana paisa hasil karne ke liye adaalaton main bahut adhik dhan or samay jaaya karnaa padataa he
 According to sources, the government is making such amendments in the related law that the courts may order interim payment to the aggrieved party during the hearing
 yadi check likhane vaala mukademe se bari ho jaataa he to duusare paksh ko antarim muaavje kii raashi waapas kerani hogi
 Similarly, the appellate court can also order to deposit a part of the compensation decided by the lower court while taking the case
 sutron ne kaha ki isse bhugtan ke madhyam ke rup main check kii vishwasaneeyata badhegi tathaa is kadam se bhugtan ke liye nakadi ke chalan main kami laane kii sarkaar kii yojanaon ko bhi bal milegaa
 According to sources, the government has also proposed such a provision at the appellate level that the appellate court can order the appellant writing the check to deposit a part of the compensation decided by the trial court at the time of filing the appeal
 sanshodhan ko sansad ke maujuuda sheetakaaleen satr main hi pesh kiya ja saktaa he
 Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, while giving details of the decisions taken in the cabinet meeting, said that the amendment in the Negotiable Instruments Act-1881 has been approved
 haalanki unhone byora nahin diya
 The comments sutron ke anusaar sarkaar maanati he ki check likhane vaale ke khate main paryaapt paisa na hone yaa anya kaarnon se check bina bhugtan ke laut jane se choti or majholi ikaayiyon ko lambit avadhi main bahut pareshaani or kaarobaar kaa bada nuksaan hota he
 The government is understood to have made amendments to the 'negotiable Instruments Act 1881' on the basis of suggestions received from the general and business community in this regard and to provide for interim compensation at both the trial and appeal stage for the aggrieved party
 sarkaar ke samaksh ek saamaanya shikaayat yah bhi he ki beimaan kism ke log bhugtan main vilamb karne ke liye check bouns ke hatkande apanaate hai
 When the check bounces, the aggrieved party has to spend a lot of money and time in courts to get their money
 sutron ke anusaar sarkaar sambandhit kanoon main aisa sanshodhan kar rahi he ki adaalatein chahen to sunwaayee ke dauraan peedit paksh ko antarim bhugtan kaa aadesh kar saken
 If the person writing the check is acquitted of the case, the other party will have to return the amount of the interim compensation
 isi tarah apiliy adaalat bhi maamle ko daakhila lete samay nichali adaalat dwaara tay muaavje kaa ek hissaa jamaa karaane kaa aadesh kar sakegi
 Sources said that this will increase the credibility of the check as a medium of payment and this step will also give a boost to the government's plans to reduce the circulation of cash for payment

 The truth of the Fateparsal bomb has been revealed on 26 September in Punjab
 buudhvaar kopunjabpulice ne parcel bam bhejne vaale 42 varshiya aaropee raja rigwan ko urisa ke rourkela se giraftaar kar liya he
 Accused Rizwan confessed in police interrogation that he had a dispute over property with his brother-in-law, due to which he sent a bomb in the parcel to kill his cousin

 But still this matter has remained a headache for the police
 police ne jan swasthya abhiyantriki vibhaag (piechaidi) ke ek thekedaaron or luni ke vidhayak malakhansingh ke rishtedaar sohanlal vishnoi ko is maamle main bilada se pakadaa he
 On Thursday, the police presented him in the Rajasthan High Court and took him on seven days remand
 vishnoi ne bhavari se swift gaadi kharidi thi
 On September 1, Bhanwari, states that she had left the house to take the money owed for the same deal
 swasthya vibhaag kii maane to vah pichhali 25 agast se hi duty par nahin aa rahi thi
 Now the police is investigating the details of his mobile call
 police ko abhi tak aisa koi suraag haath nahin laga he, jisaki bina par vah karrwai ko sahi disha main le ja sake
 Many top officers, including Jodhpur Range Inspector General of Police Umesh Mishra, Jodhpur (rural) Superintendent of Police Navjyoti Gogoi, have frozen with their full strength on the spot
 ek adani-si eenem kii gudshudagi par police mahakme kii itani sakriyata
 The narrators say that the police had not killed so many hands and feet recently in the case of Naveen Jain, former District Collector of Baran, who was mysteriously missing (then found)
 itani badi prashasnic tatparta hi asal main ghatana ke peeche kii gambhirtha kaa suraag de detii he
 Bhanwari Devi's mother-in-law of thirty-six years old, beautiful face and attractive Kadakathi is in Borunda, a small village in the district, but her reach and connections are also from the high-ranking people
 bhavari kaa pati ek lakjri gaadi kiraye par chalaata he
 Bhanwari's chic-baht, who does a minor job of ANM herself, is no less than an officer
 uske paas jodhpur main aaleeshaan makaan or borunda main bhi do manjila makaan he
 The mother of three children, a daughter of Bhanwari is studying in Jaipur
 gadiyon kaa use khaas shauk he
 In the past, it has paid 5-6 lakhs
 main aane vaali swift gaadi bechakar itani keemat main aane vaali nai indigo gaadi kharidi thi
 There was also a driver to drive
 bhavari ke ghar par bedroom main police kii chaanbin ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki vah videshi or mahange spray kaam main leti thi
 The people of the region were well aware of the reach and identity of Bhanwari, who lived the life of Aishoram
 jodhpur ke bilada kshetra ke jaaliwada khurd ke up swasthya centre par karyrat bhavari naukari ke naam par keval dastakhat karne jaati thi
 The result of his lofty relationship was that nobody dared to complain even on such 'negligence'
 mahakme ke logon kii maane to pichley aath maheenon main vah mushkil se aath din hi naukari par ai hogi
 Yes, the villagers of Benan village once complained to Bhanwari, the mistress of the will, to the Collector
 is par colector ne use apio kar diya tha
 The very next day, she got engaged at the sub-health center at Jaliwara Khurd
 jaahir he yah uski pahunch kaa hi nateeja tha
 The District Health and Medical Officer and the Block Medical Officer were also kind to him, rather say that he had to be kind
 uske liye niyamon ko taak par rakhaa gaya
 Despite the provision of one ANM at the sub-health center, Bhanwari was placed as the second ANM
 vajahah shaayad yahi ki uske aane, na aane par koi sthaneey virodh na ho
 Amidst all the rounds of heated discussions across the state, it is being told that Bhanwari has three cds
 ek pradesh ke ek cabinet mantri kii, duusari satta paksh ke ek vidhayak kii or teesri purv jila up pramukh kii
 Apparently, the first doubt is on the local MLA, but tired of answering the people for the last three months, the BJP MLA from Bilara, Arjunlal says, "I am not that MLA
 '' ve aage bataate hai kisi bhavari devi kaa tinek maheene pehle phone jarur aayaa tha
 He had talked about leaving the Congress and joining the BJP
 ''usne yah bhi kaha tha ki use vasundhara (raaje) ji se mila diya jaae, uske paas sarkaar giraane kaa masala he
 "believe Arjun Lal, he did not want to get into any trouble, so he stopped picking fawn of Bhanwari
" par vah masala kya tha? vah dhire-dhire kshetra ke logon kii jabaan par aa gaya
 Malkhan Singh, a resident of Bilara and MLA from the neighboring Luni assembly constituency, also keeps himself away from the case
 ''is maamle main police se hi puuchhie
 When the investigation is going on then commenting on it is not right
 '' teja dashami par nagaur ke kharnal main aae pradesh congress adhyaksh dow
 Chandrabhan even told Bemuravati that he had no knowledge of the matter
 vaise maamle ke jaanch adhikari, jodhpur ke atirikt police adheekshak abhilash taak bataate hai ki bhavari kii gumshudagi ke baad uske apharan kaa bhi maamla darj hua he
 Let me tell you that Bhanwari also started feeling heartbroken in politics due to his association with the influential people
 sarkari naukar rahete hue vah apane gaanv or sthaneey chunaavon main congress pratyaashee kaa prachaar karti
 She was seen with the leaders and also on the stage
 pradesh ke shiksha mantri master bhanvaralaal ne nagaur main panchayatiraj vyavastha ke tahat panchon ko nae adhikaar dete vakt jab 'nurson kii chotii aapke haath main' jaisaa vivaadit bayaan diya to jodhpur jile main pehle bhavari ne hi unka virodh kiya tha
 It was heard that in the last assembly elections, Bhanwari had also sought a ticket from the Congress
 na milane par nirdaleey ladane kii manshaa banaai par sthaneey netaaon ke samajhane par maan gai
 Bhanwari was also an artist
 sthaneey lokadevataaon samet kai tarah ke vishyon par taiyaar albamon main vah kaam kar chuki he
 For example, Kunwar Veer Teja, Ram Bharosa cart and do not go
 ab uskaa rutaba, uske mobile kii lambii kol detel or logon main usase judi charchaaen police karrwai main adchane daal rahi hai
 Now it has to be seen whether the police are able to do milk and water of milk? july, 2019 se bharat main kaaron kii duniya main yatriyon kii suraksha ko dhyaan main rakhte hue abhootpurv badlaav hone ja rahaa he

 Time and money will be saved
 Keeping data centers under water means there will be no need to spend more to keep the servers cool
 microsoft kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki data centres ke liye capsule sirf 90 dinon main taiyaar ho jaaenge jabaki jameen par ek data centre banane main 2 saal lagate hai
 Engineers involved in this project even believe that one day the data centers inside the sea can make electricity themselves with the help of underwater turbines or tidal power
 prototip data centre 105 din rahaa pani ke andarcompany ne is edia par 2013 se kaam karnaa shuru kiya tha

 Jagat Prakash Nadda of fifty-eight years will be the first working president of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 unke purvavarti, nae grih mantri amit shah disambar main apana kaarykaal khatm hone tak adhyaksh bane rahenge
 After that, Nadda is likely to become the party president in line with the 'one person - one post' principle of the party
 party mahasachiv or chhattisgarh ke prabharee ke rup main 2014 main nadda ke kaamkaaj ko najadik se dekh chuke bhaajapa ke ek padaadhikari kehete hai ki ''ve achche chairman ke adheen kaam karne vaale achche prabandhak hai or nishchit rup se kisi tarah kaa nuksaan pahunchane vaali prakruti ke nahin hai
 "this comment is the same as other party's perception of Nadda that he is a trustworthy person
" is dharna ke saath hi jo baat chhipi hui he vah yah he ki nadda par shah or pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bharosa he ki ve vahi karte hai jo unhen kaha jaae or unki apni rajnatik aakankshaayen simit hai
 Since Shah became the home minister, BJP members and political analysts had speculated that there would be internal tussle for power in the party
 sheersh par sahi aadmi kii gairmaujuudagi main satta ke liye khinchataan aprihaary ho jaati
 But at least till the end of his term, Shah will retain control of the party's activities
 nadda kii niyukti ke bare main party board kii baithak ke baad modi ne kaha ki nae kaaryakari adhyaksh ''lagnsheel or parishramee'' hai
 He also added that "he (nadda) has come from the bottom of the party and he has respect in the BJP family
" ''gauratlab he ki nadda rashtriya swayamsevak sangh main bhi lokapriy or sakvamanit hai
 Modi's eyes were on him when Modi was in charge of Himachal Pradesh as BJP secretary in the mid-1990s and Nadda was a minister in the state government
 nadda us samay apane jivan ke chauthe dashak main the or modi ko unki anushaasit kaaryastylee tathaa party ke prati aagyaakaarita pasand aa gai thi
 Nadda is an old-fashioned politician who maintains dialogue with the people of his region without any frills
 pichhali modi sarkaar main swasthya mantri ke rup main nadda ke karyaalay main aksar himachal pradesh se aae shubhachintakon kii bheed lagi rahati thi
 BJP leaders and activists consider him warm and friendly
 vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki nadda kii logon ko khush rakhane kii kala kisi asantosh yaa satta kii raajnneeti ke kathin maukon par madadgaar hogi
 His personal popularity will be helpful if he is forced to take a drastic decision (or appears to be doing so) in view of the party's organizational elections and the crucially important Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand assembly elections
 phir bhi jo sawaal bana hua he vah yah ki kya ve shah jaisi sakriyata dikhaa paaenge or yatraaon kaa vaisaa hi shramsadhy kaarykram jari rakh paaenge?bhaajapa adhyaksh ke rup main apane 1,700 din ke kaarykaal main shah 1,000 din tak yatra par rahe hai

 Moderating his stand, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Wednesday said that it is necessary for the party to remain in the bjp-led coalition without compromising on 'respect' in the larger interest of Maharashtra
 raut ne kaha ki agali sarkaar banane main koi jaldbaaji nahin he
 He dismissed suggestions that the Shiv Sena could split if the formation of a new Council of Ministers was delayed
 bataa den, rajya main sarkaar gathan par media se baat karte hue raut ne kaha ki rajya ke hit main shivasena ke liye bhagava gathbandhan main bane rahanaa jaruri he, lekin ‘sammaan' bhi mahatvapurn he
 Rajya Sabha member Raut said, 'individuals are not important, but the interest of the state is important
 shant tareeke se or rajya ke hit ko dhyaan main rakhkar faisla karne kii jarurat he
 Significantly, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party has been aggressively pushing the 50:50 formula on alternating chief ministerial post and power sharing, but the BJP has rejected the demand
 raut ne kaha ki donon sahyogiyon ke bich 21 oktober ko hue vidhansabha chunaav se pehle jo tay hua tha unki party bas use hi lagu karwaanaa chaahati he
 Asked if the Shiv Sena was adamant on implementing the 50:50 formula (similar sharing of power), Raut said, "you (media) are saying this
" ham sirf yah chaahate hai ki jo pehle tay hua tha vaise hi chijen hon
 He said that there is no question of any newly elected Shiv Sena MLA leaving the party due to the delay in government formation
 raut ne kaha, ‘kisi bhi party kaa koi nav-nirvaachit vidhayak alag nahin hoga
 There is no question of this happening to Shiv Sena mlas

 Regarding the reports that the BJP has offered 13 posts to the Deputy Chief Minister and the Shiv Sena, Raut refrained from giving a direct reply and said, 'we are not sitting with bookkeeping
 ' shivasena ke mukhpatr ‘saamana' ke kaaryakari sampadak raut ne satta main samaan bhagidaari or baari-baari se mukhyamantri pad kii party kii maangon ko mukhar rup se vyakt karte rahe hai
 Raut even said on Tuesday that the party has more 'options' if the BJP does not agree to its main demands
 unhone kaha tha, ‘ham bhaajapa ke saath gathbandhan main vishwaas karte hai, kyonki hamane saath milakar chunaav ladaa, lekin bhaajapa ko hamen sarkaar gathan ke liye vikalp par gaur karne kaa paap karne par vivash nahin karnaa chahie
 On the other hand, the BJP has insisted that Fadnavis will continue as the chief minister for the next five years
 bataa den, bhaajapa ne maharashtra kii 288 vidhansabha siton main se 105 siton par, jabaki shivasena ne 56 siton par jeet darj kii

 He had defended the bjp's Raghuvar government at the time, saying, "we got every charge investigated but we could not find any instance of starvation death
" jharkhand pahaalaa aisa rajya he jisane bhukh se hui maut kii paribhaasha tay karne ke liye ek cameti banaai he
 "it is a matter of fact that today Saryu Rai is claiming more than two dozen scams in the Raghuvar government

 ’’ darasal yah baat sach bhi he kyonki aap kisi bhi adivasee mukhyamantri kaa itihaas uthaae to paaenge ki unka prabhaav kabhi bhi rajyavyapee nahin rahaa
 Asked by Jharkhand Mukti Morcha spokesperson Supriyo Bhattacharya whether the issue of starvation deaths would figure prominently in his manifesto? He says, absolutely our party raised this issue the most

 It is also true that JMM tried to surround the BJP very much on this issue
 lekin khatra yah bhi he ki kahin ghoshnaa patr main shaamil hokar yah mudda mahaj chunaav jeetne kaa hathiyaar banakar na rah jaae

 somvaar ko jab naidu se poocha gaya ki mahagathbandhan kaa cheharaa koun hoga
 So Mamata Banerjee spoke in the middle that every leader of the grand alliance will be its face
 chandrababu naidu ne kaha ki vah modi se senior hai or unase badhiya kaam bhi kiya he
 It is natural to get the message from such statements that it is not so easy to bring everyone on one platform
 sapa-basapa kii apni kahaneebasapa or sapa milakar chunaav ladengi is par baat to ho chuki he lekin chunaavon tak sab thik rahegaa is par andeh bhi jataae jate rahe hai
 It is said that whatever decisions Mayawati will take in view of Uttar Pradesh
 agar upi main donon kaa gathbandhan paravaan nahin chadh paaya to mahagathbandhan kaa paravaan chadhana mushkil he

 It is not difficult to convince Mamta, CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury had already said that he is ready to join the coalition to defeat BJP

 He said that such coalitions first take place at the state level
 phir desh ke str par isko aakaar miltaa he lekin mamata sipiem ke saath manch saajha karne ko taiyaar hongi is par andeh he
 Mamta's entire politics is about West Bengal

 How much will Kejriwal Chandrababu Naidu also meet Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and appealed to him to join the anti-bjp front
 lekin raajnneetik samikshakon kaa kahana he ki dilli se baahar apane pair pasaarne ke liye betaab kejariwal kya man se kisi kaa netritv sweekaar kar paaenge
 They also have a lot to say
 unhone dilli ke vidhansabha chunaavon main us samay bhaajapa kaa rath roak diya tha jab puure desh main bhaajapa kii hawa chal rahi thi
 Sharad Pawar has already expressed suspicion that when Chandrababu Naidu met Sharad Pawar, he advocated an anti-bjp front
 lekin ajtak ke kaarykram main hi sharad pavaar mahagathbandhan banane par andeh jataa chuke hai
 There is also a distance that if Chandrababu Naidu can say that he is senior to Modi, then Sharad Pawar is senior to both of them
 phir wo cheharaa kyon nahin ho sakate
 Why not Rahul? Congress is the largest party after BJP
 rahul gandhi saarvajanik rup se ichha vyakt kar chuke hai ki wo pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar hai
 If the Grand Alliance is being formed and everyone is contesting elections against the BJP, then why can't Rahul be the face of the alliance
 saath aate hai lekin man nahin milatechandrababu naidu ne somvaar ko kolkata main kaha ki sansthaaen khatre main hai, arabiai se lekar sibiai main jo ho rahaa he vah sabake saamne he

 Every week, a ceremony is being organized for naming
 dilli ke janakapuri ilaake main 2 maheene main kareeb 12 parkon kaa namakaran ho chukaa he
 The parks have been named after great men like Maharishi Valmiki, Swami Vivekananda, Shaheed Bhagat, Chandrashekhar Azad, Acharya Hazari Prasad Dwivedi, Guru Dronacharya, Lal Bahadur Shastri
 isi tarah vikaspuri main bhi swami dayanand saraswati, baba sahab dow
 The parks have been named after Bhimrao Ambedkar, Swami Vivekananda
 uttam nagar main bhi sadakon ke naam badalakar mahapurushon ke naam par rakhe gaye hai
 Councilors do not speak openly in the election season, but they definitely say that this will inspire people
 sawaal ye he ki aakhirkaar parshadon kochunaav se thik pehle hi logon ko prerana dene kii yadakyon aati he
 Losing a 3–1 series in England may not be a great shame for India as we have set many records in losing this time too
 masalan aakhri test kaa mahaj teen din ke andar khatm ho janaa, puri bhartiya team kaa 94 ranon par out ho janaa, lagbhag ek din main hi do pariyon kaa simat janaa vagairah-vagairah
 The series had so many embarrassing records that it is not believed that some of the best batsmen in the world were playing in it
 viraat kohli or cheteshwar pujaara jinhen tendulkar or dravid kii barabari kaa khilaadi mana ja rahaa tha, bacchon kii tarah khelte dikhe
 Virat Kohli was so nervous with the swinging balls of the England fast bowlers that he was dismissed on the bowling of every bowler
 10 pariyon main unhone kul 134 ran banaae or ek bhi match main apni batting nahin dikhaa sake
 The same was the case with Pujara, who is considered the most reliable Test batsman
 is baar phir swing karti gendon ko khilne main bhartiya ballebaajon kii kamazori saamne ai
 There is a lot of difference between scoring runs on lifeless and dull pitches of India and playing on the lively and swinging balls of the England bowlers
 england ke gendbaaj puri teji ke saath genden daal rahe the jo donon dishaao main swing kar rahi thim
 In such a situation, Indian bowlers put arms in front of them
 james anderson, stuart broad jaise tej gendbaajon ne unki kamazori bhaanpakar genden phenki
 But on the contrary, our bowlers like Bhuvneshwar Kumar lost their pace and rhythm after the first two matches
 lords main bhartiya gendbaajon ne shandaar gendbaaji karne ke baad nihaayat hi niraashajanak gendbaaji kii
 He neither had the speed nor the ability to swing on both sides
 eshanth sharma ko chhodkar koi aisa gendbaaj nahin tha jo wicket lene ke kareeb bhi pahunch paa rahaa tha
 The saddest thing is that the present India does not have any spinner who can get it sold in adverse conditions
 aswin nihaayat hi saadhaaran spinner hai jo bhartiya paristhitiyon main hi wicket nahin le sakate
 Surprisingly, the Indian batsman who specializes in playing spin balls became the victim of a b grade bowler like Moin Ali
 jahaan tak bharat kii fielding kii baat he to itani niraashajanak fielding kabhi nahin dekhi gai he
 It is clear that the entire team, including the captain and the coach, are responsible for this defeat
 dhoni kii captaini behad saadhaaran si thi or unamem koi vijan nahin dikhaa
 But for this reason they cannot be made scapegoats
 agar iske liye koi jimmedaar ho saktaa he to vah he bisisiai jisane sirf apni tijori bharne ke sivaa or koi kaam nahin kiya
 The IPL inflicted a deep injury on the correct technique of the players and their ability to play the Test has definitely decreased
 itnaa hi nahin bhartiya team lagaataar match khelti ja rahi he or siries kii bharmaar he
 Obviously, no player can maintain his form after playing so many matches
 yahi bhartiya khilaadiyon ke saath ho rahaa he
 He cannot remain number one after playing so many matches
 tii-20 ne unke khilne kii pratibha ko viksit nahin hone diya
 The players are also not worried about him, as they know that by hitting fours and sixes in the IPL, they will earn enough money and fame

 'sir, an essay of five hundred words will be fine or a thousand words, what will be the size of the jacket

 'when the meat exporter Moin Qureshi sent this BBM (blackberry Messenger) message to AP Singh last year, the former director of CBI and currently a member of the Union Public Service Commission replied,' 500 hundred words, 40 jacket collar size 16

 According to this case is of 2013

 From the current perspective, this message is one of those mysterious messages that convinced Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi to inform the Supreme Court on October 17 that Singh's conduct was not good for his position

 In another BBM message in 2013, Qureshi asked Singh, 'do you need some of the documents you have left with me? ' singh kaa jawaab tha, 'kuch behad maamuli kagajaat
 However, Qureshi has since denied any file mentioned in the message
 jabaki is sandesh ko indian computer immergency respons team ne 15 farvari ko kuraishi ke yahaan red ke dauraan unke laptop main paaya tha
 Singh also denied that the BBS message was part of any coded conversation
 unhone kaha, 'kuraishi landan ke daure par the, isliye maine usase paris kii dukaanon se kuch shart laane ko kaha
 'further, the essay being referred to was based on international bribery for my daughter, which i gave to Quraishi for formatting

" 'gauratlab he ki may ke dauraan hi ye khabaren ai thi ki inakam tex ke adhikari kuraishi or singh ke bich hue bibiem miseging kii jaanch kar rahe hai
 It was clear from these messages that the two knew each other very well, so the businessman Qureshi had sought 'help' from AP Singh

 bjp's PM candidate and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi wants to contest the Lok Sabha elections on the issue of development, but his new state has been counted among the less developed states in a new development index
 arabiai governor raghuram rajan kii adhyakshata vaale samooh ne gujarat ko 'kam viksit rajyon' kii shrenee main rakhaa he
 The group categorized eight states, including Odisha and Bihar, as 'least developed' states
 goa or kerala samet saat rajyon ko 'apekshaakrit rup se viksit' shrenee main rakhaa gaya he
 Modi supporters have flared up on social media for describing Gujarat as less developed
 yah jang twitor or fasebuk se aage badhkar raajnneetik bayaanbaji kaa rup bhi le sakati he
 People have started making political interpretation of this report on the least developed social media in odisha-bihar
 kai logon kaa maananaa he ki bihar main nitish kumaar or odisha main naveen patnayak ko aakarshith karne ke liye upie sarkaar ne yah chaal chali he
 Experts are of the opinion that even though Naveen Patnaik is not likely to join the UPA at present, this step will definitely put moral pressure on him not to go to the NDA

 The Modi cabinet had increased the MSP, or minimum support price, of about 14 crops in the same July in view of the loss to farmers on sale of crops, but is the farmer getting the benefit? Aajtak went to Karond Mandi in Bhopal and found that unlike the claims of the government, the produce of the farmer was being sold at a lower price than the MSP
 darasal, isi saal july main modi cabinet ne dhan samet kai fasalon kaa nunatam samarthan mulya badhaate hue kisaanon ko ek bada tohfa diya tha
 The government then called it a major relief for the farmers
 sarkaar ke daawey kii padtaal karne ke liye ajtak kii team bhopal kii karond mandi main pahunchi, jahaan in dinon kisaan apni soyabean or makka kii fasal bechney aa rahe hai
 Soybeans being sold below MSP, we saw heaps of soybeans where farmers from different villages came to sell their soybeans
 mandi main ek jagah soyabean kii safai hote dekh ham vahaan ruke or baatcheet shuru kii
 Here we found Akhilesh Nagar bringing 40 quintals of soybeans from Bakaniyan village
 aapako bataa den ki sarkaar ne soyabean par nunatam samarthan mulya yani emspi tay kii he ₹
 3399 rupees per quintal but when we asked what the price of his soybean was sold, Akhilesh told him the price of soybean was ₹
 3240 rupee prati quintal mila
 That is, Rs 1060 less than the MSP
 sirf akhilesh hi nahi, balki sihor jile ke shahjahanpur se aae kisaan parvat singh kii soyabean bhi emspi se kam bhav me biki
 Parvat Singh told that his soybean was ₹
 3252 prati quintal ke bhav se biki jo ki emspi se ₹
 1050 was less
 parvat singh ne apana dukhada bataate hue kaha ki dijal, kitnashak, khaad, mazdooree or fasal ko tractor trollies se mandi tak laane kaa kiraaya jod diya jaae to prati quintal kharchaa hi kareeb kareeb ₹
 3500 to ₹
 4000 tak ho jaataa he aise main kisaan kaa sirf maran hi ho rahaa he phayda nahin
 Farmers demand that the MSP of soybean be increased to at least ₹
 5000 prati quintal kar diya jaae jisase fasal par lagane vaali laagat to vasuul ho hi saath hi main thodaa phayda bhi ho jaae
 However, Mandi's accountant says that when the demand is low in the market, how did the MSP meet? When we talked to Munim Badam Singh, he told that the farmer is not at a loss because ₹
 3399 ke emspi par use ₹
 3200 and getting ₹
 500 sarkaar kii taraf se bhavantar ke lekin jab hamane poocha ki bhavantar kii rakam is baar milegi to khud munim baadaam singh ne mana ki is baar bhavantar kii rakam shaayad hi kisaan ko mili
 Badam Singh gave another reason to get less
 usne bataaya ki soyabean kii fasal main mitti bahut hoti he isliye kai baar soyabean kii gunvattta par bhi daam nilaamee ke jariye tay hote hai
 In addition to the soybean in Namandi, the MSP is also getting a good number of maize on these days
 aapako bataa den ki makke par emspi ₹
 1700 but maize is also selling at a much lower price than MSP
 ratibad gaanv se makka bechney aae kisaan aamir ali ko bhi emspi se kam bhav par hi apni upaj bechni padi
 Mecca to Aamir ₹
 1421 prati quintal ke bhav se bechnaa padaa yani emspi se ₹
 Loss of 279
 aamir ali ne bataaya ki kaise din ba din kisaanon ke liye kheti karnaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he kyonki baaki sabhi chizon ke daam to bad rahe hai, lekin fasalon par milane vaali rakam lagaataar kam hi bani hui he
 Like Aamir, Mahendra Gaur, a farmer from Kodia village, came to sell maize with a trolley, but he also got ₹ below MSP
 1400 ke kareeb hi makka bechnaa padaa
 When we asked the trader who bought his produce why MSP was getting lower prices, he said that the maize has been bought according to the price fixed in the auction
 yahaan bhi kisaanon ke nuksaan ko bhavantar kii raashi se kam kiya jane kaa daawa to kiya lekin jab poocha ki uski raashi kab aegi to iskaa jawaab vyapaaree ke paas bhi nahin tha
 It is clear that by increasing the MSP compared to last year, the government looted accolades but forgot the farmers because the farmer is still standing there and is forced to sell at a much lower price than the cost

 This is Shura's decision and there is no question of going against it
 maine pehle bhi kaha tha ki shura kaa jo bhi faisla hoga, vah mujhe manjuur hoga
 By the way i have had injustice
 yah puche jane par ki is faisle ke khilaaf vah adaalat kaa rukh karenge to unhone kaha ki adaalat main jane kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Darul Uloom's reputation is very important to me

 When Shura gave the verdict, i accepted it
 meraa maananaa he ki report adhuri nahin honi chahie thi
 He said that i have great respect for Darul Uloom
 main shura kaa sadsy bana rahoonga
 There is no question of separation from it

 Immediately after that he had said in an interview that the Muslims of Gujarat should go ahead forgetting the 2002 riots, though he refused to give a clean chit to the state Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 unke is bayaan ke baad vivaad khadaa hua
 When asked about his future plans, Vastanvi said, "I am involved with many things
" talim se meraa lagaav gaharaa he or main isse aage bhi judaa rahoonga
 This issue for me ended here
 unhone kaha ki main chahta hum ki daarul ulum kaa maahaul acha bana rahe
 There should not be politics here

 One of these is very bold, while the other is of conservative views

 Although Sunny's bold style has already been liked by her fans, it will be interesting to see to what extent Sunny succeeds in playing the character of a conservative girl

 ek gaiyr-muslim aapako thodaa sa sir dard hone par bhi roza chhodane kii salaah hi degaa
 You just have to see who's going to give advice? a Muslim doctor who is religious will never give you wrong advice
 'mufti ne aage kaha ki diabetes se thodaa pareshaan logon ko roza chhodane kii ijaajat nahin di gai he
 a spokesperson of Ofcom said, "we have found in investigation that it is very dangerous and objectionable to motivate diabetic patients to keep fast and to ignore medical counseling

 Religious beliefs should not come in the medical profession because in the end a medical advice is medical

 com / dfuiur6x7b bhartiya team ne buudhvaar ko mohali main khele gaye duusare tii-20 match main dakshin africa ko maat dekar teen maichon kii siries main 1-0 se ajey badhat hasil kar lee he
 The first match of this series was rained down
 team india ne isi ke saath apane hi desh main is team ke khilaaf pehali baar kisi tii-20 international match main jeet kaa swaad chakhaa he or apane puraane daag ko bhi dho diya he
 The list of rivalry between India and South Africa in T20 International is not long
 isse pehle donon ke bich 13 tii-20 mukaable khele gaye the, jinamein se bharat ne 8, jabaki south africa ne 5 match jite the
 Two matches (kolkata and Dharamsala) were also canceled between the two
 lekin bharat apni dharti par tii-20 main south africa ko nahin haraa paaya tha
 India and South Africa had two matches in India before the Mohali T20
 ye donon match south africa ne jite, jabaki kolkata (2015) or dharmashala (2019) ke match radd ho gaye the
 Team India won a T20 International against South Africa for the first time on their own soil as soon as they won in Mohali
 2 oktober 2015 ko dharmashala main khelaa gaya match south africa ne 7 wicket se jeeta, jabaki usee saal 5 oktober ko katak kaa muqabla africa team ne 6 wicket se jeeta
 T20 International: 1 in South Africa India
 2 oktober 2015: dharmashala- south africa 7 wicket se jeeta2
 5 October 2015: Cuttack - South Africa won by 6 wickets 3
 8 oktober 2015: kolkata- match radd4
 15 September 2019: Dharamshala - Match Canceled 5
 18 sitambar 2019: mohali- bharat 7 wicket se jitamohali ke pisie ground par bharat ne kabhi tii-20 muqabla nahin ganvaaya he
 India also retained this record against South Africa
 2009-2019 ke dauraan bharat ne yahaan teen match khele hai or teenon hi jite hai
 The South African team played T20 International in Mohali for the first time
 tii-20 international: mohali main team india1
 12 December 2009: India beat Sri Lanka by 6 wickets 2
 27 march 2016: bharat ne australia ko 6 wicket se haraaya3
 18 September 2019: Mohali - India won by 7 wickets uttarakhand main jeet ko lekar congressi itane aashwast hai ki nattejey aane se pehle hi mukhyamantri pad ke liye hode much gai he
 As usual, the contenders are busy pulling the legs of their rivals instead of mobilizing them
 alaakaman ne mukhyamantri pad ke liye vidhayakon se itar bhi daravaaje khol sabaki ummiden jagaa di hai
 This may increase the difficulties for the Congress as allies in the government of simple majority at the Center are showing tantrums
 aise main party loksabhaa main apni sankhya kam karne kaa jokhim nahin lenaa chaahegi
 Congress General Secretary in-charge of Uttarakhand, Chaudhary Birendra Singh, while confirming the claim of half a dozen leaders for the post of Chief Minister before the election results in the state, says, "there is no necessary criterion that only an MLA should become the Chief Minister
" vidhayak dal se saamaanya taur par raay lee jaati he, jisamen vidhayak-saansad ke alaava koi anya naam bhi aa saktaa he
 But the high command will take the final decision
 ' kendriya rajyamantri harish ravat, pradesh adhyaksh yashpal arya, vipaksh ke netaa harak singh ravat, satpal maharaj, indira hridayesh, saansad vijay bahuguna, amrutha ravat jaise aadha darjan se adhik netaa daud main hai
 To say, Narayan Dutt Tiwari may also be in the race but at the age of 87, he himself is not ready for this role
 alaakaman main paith kii vajah se kendriya sansadeey kaary rajyamantri harish ravat majboot daavedaar hai
 But Rawat is facing allegations of winding up the rebels and working against some big leaders in the elections in alleged connivance with the disgruntled BJP leader Ramesh Pokhriyal 'nishank'
 sonia gandhi ke rajnatik salaahkaar ahamed patel or congress mahasachiv digvijay singh kathith taur par ravat ke liye lamabandi kar rahe hai
 a senior leader, who was among those who gave decisive suggestions in the selection of the chief minister, says to Rawat, "how long will a person be wronged
" ' vaise, ravat ke khilaaf rahul gandhi khemaa roda atka saktaa he, kyonki jahaan ravat samarthak baagi ummidavaaron ke jeetne kii sambhaavna he, vahaan rahul samarthakon ko tikat mila tha
 In the state unit, there are more opponents than Rawat's supporters, who are constantly claiming that it will not be easy to win the Lok Sabha by-election from Haridwar seat
 yahi sthiti tehri se saansad vijay bahuguna ke daawey ko lekar bhi he
 Uttar Pradesh Congress President Rita Bahuguna Joshi is her sister, so it will not be easy for the Congress to promote Brahmin leadership in Uttarakhand too
 lekin uttar pradesh main sthiti anukool nahin rahi to bhaajapa ke bhuwan chandra khandudi kii kaat ke liye congress brahman card khel sakati he
 In the tussle over the chief minister's post, state president Yashpal Arya's claim is extremely strong because of his Dalit and good record of victory
 dalit hone ke naate arya par daanv lagaana ranneetik or saamaajik sameekaran ke lihaaj se congress or rahul gandhi ke rashtriya mishan-2014 ke liye mufeed ho saktaa he
 According to sources, Tiwari and Bahuguna may also support Arya in the event of more controversy for this post
 vipaksh ke netaa harak singh ravat ne bhi hafte bhar dilli main deraa daalkar apane liye lamabandi kii he
 Another contender, Satpal Maharaj, is considered close to Rahul Gandhi
 iske alaava anya daavedaaron main purv mantri indira hridayesh, satpal maharaj kii patni amrutha ravat or tiwari ke khaas navaprabhat kii bhi charchaa he
 Tiwari, once the guardian of Hridayesh, is angry with him
 aise main congress kisi mahila par daanv lagaati he to amrutha kaa naam upar aa saktaa he
 Now it will be interesting to see which of these Congress contenders opens the lottery or someone else wins an anonymous face
 lekin congress kii sarkaar nahin bani to khandudi kii vaapasi hogi or abhi ghuddaud karne vaale congressi lambii tanakar sone ko majaboor honge
 As of today, there is no dispute for the post of Chief Minister in BJP
 noida main shuukravaar ko mukhyamantri mayawati jis park kaa udghaatan karne vaali hai, wo janata kii gadhi kamai ke 700 karod rupee kharch karke banaaya gaya he
 Face recognition, win prizes
 bhaag lene ke lieclic karanjanta kii gadhi kamai ke 700 karod rupee kaa bana he ye park noida main he or logon ke khun-paseene kii kamai park main lagane ke baad ab is dalit prerana sthal ko janata ke liye kholaa jayega
 On the 14th of this month, the head of the state is going to inaugurate Mayawati Park
 padhein: mayawati ne kanshiram kii barsi par 483 yojanaon kaa elaanjanata kii jeb se nikle arabon rupayon se is park ko raja ke mahal jaisaa sajaayaa gaya he
 
 baahar se hi park kii shaano-shaukat kaa andaja ho jaataa he
 But when going inside, the real glory of the park is seen
 dalit prerana sthal naam kaa park saadhe 82 acre main bana he
 It can be estimated that what will be the cost of such land in Noida
 park ko chaaron taraf se gulabi pattharon se sajaayaa gaya he
 Read: Mayawati removed two ministers from Lokpur after the Lokayukta report has been sourced from Bharatpur in Rajasthan
 park main bheetar marble bhi lagaae gaye hai
 It can be understood from this how much money would have been invested in the park
 park main 40 meter ooncha ek bada gumbad he
 Which has 3 small domes
 pehle gumbad main bhimrao ambedkar kii puri jeevani deevaaron par shabdon or chitron ke jariye ukeri gai he
 So the second is the story of Mayawati's life and political journey
 jabaki tisare gumbad main kanshiram kaa jivan parichay he
 Not only this, there is something very special in this park made by the hard earned money of the public
 padhein: garibi rekha paramayawati ne likhi piem ko chittheepark main dalit samaaj ke netaaon or santon kii kul 15 murtiyon lagi hai
 Most of the sculptures are made of bronze
 main gumbad main bhi 3 murtiyon 20 feet kii lagaai gai hai
 On each side of the dome, high 20 statues of elephants have been placed
 52 feet oonche do fawwaare bhi lagaae gaye hai
 Which are made of bronze
 padhen: gurbat main he mayawati kaa bhaisube kii mukhiya mayawati ke sapanom kaa park taiyaar he
 Now wait for this park to open to the public
 lekin sawaal ye he ki 700 karod rupee ek park main lagane kii jagah, agar janata ke vikaas main lagaae gaye hote to saikadon pariwaron kii roji-roti kaa jugad ho saktaa tha
 The park of 700 crores is as good as it sounds to listen and is as proud as it looks
 utana hi bada sawaal ye he ki 700 karod rupee ek park par kharch kar dena, kya jaij he
 In Bihar, the ruling Janata Dal (united) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said on Sunday that there is casteism in the DNA of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha ki bihar main jati-aadhaarit raajnneeti ke khatme kaa unka aahvaan virodhabhas se bharaa hua he
 Neeraj Kumar said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is organizing meetings of diverse castes to entice people of diverse castes in the state assembly elections to be held this year
 jad(you) ke varisht vidhayak ne kaha, 'modi ne apana vartmaan pad paane ke liye khud apni pichhadi jati kaa istemaal kiya
 He is now calling for the end of caste-based politics in Bihar, but during the Lok Sabha elections last year, he himself used his backward caste
 tippaniyan Along with him, his party is also playing the caste card by calling him a 'chaiwala' and a leader of backward caste
 ' niraj ne kaha ki modi kii tippanee unke paakhand ko benakaab karti he

 If China dares to fight the war with India, then it will have to face a bad face
 desh ke sainya suraksha kii kaman thaamne vaale jane-maane generalon ne china kii samoochee takat kaa hisaab lagaaya he or is nishkarsh par pahunche ki agar china ne yuddh kii himakat kii, use buree tarah haarana hoga
 Of course war should always be avoided
 agar koi yuddh ko majaak samajhane lage, to uskaa ahankaar ek din use hi majaak main badal detaa he
 The famous Indian Military Review, a watchdog on the Indian border and the army, wrote that the syllabus of the 1962 victory that China is testing with its tolerance to India has changed, and China could neither understand it in its whims Has not been able to think on it
 indian military rivyuu ne likhaa ki china kii taiyaari na keval kamjor he, balki uske paas yuddh ke maahir general bhi nahin hai
 China started preparations against India from 2016 itself
 saat sainik kshetron ko jodakar usne paanch kshetron main badla tha or iskaa commander general jhu janki ko banaaya tha
 Zangqi has been posted as commander in Tibet for 20 years
 akele janki ko hi pataa he ki bhutan, sikkim or arunachal se lage ilaakon main yuddh ladanaa kitna mushkil he? baaki kii puri chini sena buree tarah bhram kii shikaar he
 According to the Indian Military Review, the battle between China and India will take place in the year 2018
 donon hi deshon ne iske liye qamar kas lee he or ab keval iskaa elaan baaki he, lekin bada sawaal ye he ki agar yuddh hota he, to bharat kii sthiti kya hogi? china kaa muqabla ham kaise karenge? uske maarak yuddh vimaanon, mixizon or bedon ke saamne hamaari apni takat kahaan tehregi?jaisaa ki indian military rivyuu kahata he kichin dokalampar ek-ek kadam aage to badha rahaa he, lekin bheetar hi bheetar wo do kadam peeche hatataa ja rahaa he
 Because once the declaration of war is over, how many fronts India will open, it does not even have a fair idea
 indian military rivyuu ne ek kalpana kii ki agar 2018 bharat main yuddh hota he, to uskaa swaroop kya hoga? kahaan-kahaan hamaari senaayen takaraaengi or hamaari ranneeti kya hogi? general jidi bakshi ke mutabik china ladakh kii taraf se bharat par pehali chadhaai karegaa
 To cover it up, Pakistan will violate a large-scale ceasefire in Kashmir, thereby diverting India's attention
 iske liechinatibet or sarahadi ilaakon main baari taadaad main gola barood abhi se jamaa karnaa shuru kar chukaa he
 China will open a second front in Chumbi Valley
 is ilaake main wo apane baari mashinaganon kaa istemaal karte hue aage badhegaa
 After this, a large contingent of Chinese army will try to cross the Brahmaputra river and only then the Indian Air Force will start its operation
 brahmaputra nadi se guzar rahi tukdi par bharat joardaar hamalaa karegaa
 China will not be able to counter it and then the war attitude will change
 china ko jahaan se pratirodh kii koi ummid nahin hogi, vahaan use kade sangharsh kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 The result will be that the contingent marching from Tibet will have to hide its face in Lhasa

 unka kahana he ki tex or sarcharge bahut zyada hai
 Airport tax and other surcharges in India are very high in the world

 This would cut airlines' expenses by up to 10 percent annually
 iskaa phayda yatriyon ko bhi milegaa kyonki airline tikaton ke rate gata dengi
 This will benefit travelers, especially those living in small towns
 iske alaava kuch aisi vyavastha bhi kii ja rahi he ki ek airlines se duusare airlanis main jane par yatri ko apana saamaan khud na lenaa pade

 a lot of time is wasted in this

 The Supreme Court in the case of refund of Rs 20 thousand crores to investors, strictly in the case of Sahara Group's disgorgement, prohibited its head Subrata Rai from going out of the country and also banned the sale of its assets

 nyaayamurti ke es radhakrishnan or nyaayamurti je es khehad kii khandpeeth ne nirdesh diya ki samooh kii kisi bhi sampatti kii nyaayalay kii anumati ke bagaiyr bikri nahin kii jaayegi
 During the hearing of the case, Senior Advocate CA Sundaram, on behalf of Subat Rai, made a final attempt to satisfy the judges regarding the execution of the court order but SEBI demolished all their arguments
 sebi ne kaha ki sahaara samooh ne apni sampatti kaa adhik moolyankan kiya he or usne 20 hajaar karod rupee kii sampatti ke malikana haq se sambandhit mul dastavej nahin saunpe hai

 42 karod rupee hi he
 He said that this land cannot be used in any way as it falls in the green area
 nyaayadhish unke is kathan se sahamat the ki is tarah ke moolyankan ko sweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he

 court ne sahaara samooh ko nirdesh diya ki 20 hajaar karod rupee kii sampattiyon ke malikana haq ke dastavej teen saptaah ke bheetar sebi ko saunpe jaayen
 The court warned that Subrata Roy would not be able to go out of India if his order was not implemented satisfactorily
 nyaayalay ne kaha tha ki vah niveshkon kaa dhan sebi ko lautaane se batch nahin saktaa he
 The court also directed the Sahara Group to submit a report of valuation of its assets to SEBI
