 police ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha, ‘jaanch kii nishpakshta ke liye hamane aaropee ko adaalat main pesh karne kaa nirnay kiya taaki pahchaan parade karai ja sake
 Comments dilli police ne pehle kumaar ko somvaar ko niyamit adaalat main pesh karne kaa nirnay kiya tha jab bihar kii adaalat se mili 72 ghante kii transit remand khatm ho rahi thi
 The police also issued a statement in this case
 sutron ne kaha ki baad main nirnay badal diya gaya kyonki jaanchakartaaon kaa maananaa tha ki aaropee ko pesh karne main vilamb karnaa uske paksh main ja saktaa he
 Earlier, police said that Manoj Kumar, arrested from Muzaffarpur in Bihar, would not be produced in court on Sunday but was later produced before Duty Magistrate Sanjay Kumar who sent him to 14 days judicial custody
 police sutron ne kaha ki kumaar pahchaan parade jaanch ke liye taiyaar he
 a senior police officer said, "for the fairness of the investigation, we have decided to present the accused in the court so that the identity parade can be conducted
 ’tippaniyan The Delhi Police had earlier decided to produce Kumar in a regular court on Monday when the 72-hour transit remand from the Bihar court was ending
 police ne is maamle main bayaan bhi jari kiya
 Sources said the decision was later changed as investigators believed that delay in presenting the accused could go in its favor

 Because of this the whale could not get the necessary nutrients, due to which it died

 SEAME naam kii enjio kii member Luca Bittau kaa kahana he ki, 'maine kabhi itani badi maatra main plastic nahin dekha
 It was like our normal life, but inside the belly of that fish
 'is tasviir ko dekhne ke baad soshal media par bhi logon ne apane-apane vus rakhe

 At the same time, he challenged the government that the Shiva temple should be built after demolishing books
 ilahabaad kaa naam badal karprayagrajarakhe jane ke sawaal par ajam khan ne kaha ki sawaal akbar or aurangzeb kaa nahin he
 You may remember at one time the name of King George Medical College was changed, but it was opposed all over the world and after all King George remained King George
 kai sarkarein ain or unhone baar-baar naam badale lekin kuch bhi nahin hua
 Mustafabad not be Sakrampur
 He said that there are some names which are not easy to remove
 misaal ke taur par rampur kaa naam hi lijie
 Nawab Mustafa Ali Khan named it Mustafabad
 aap ye jaanate hai ki rampur musalamaanon kii bahultawali basti he
 There are Muslim Nawabs here
 yahaan riyasat rahi he
 It was such a princely state that the chair of the Nawab here used to fall on the right hand side of the chair of Malika Victoria
 nawab mustafa ali khan ne iskaa naam mustafabad rakhaa lekin musalamaanon kii bahulata ke baad bhi musalamaanon ne ise mustafabad nahin kaha
 Azam Khan said that all the papers, all the registers, even in many places you will find stones written by Mustafabad
 to naam aisi cheez he jo dilon par likhi hoti he
 Rampur Mustafabad could not be held because the Muslims were open-hearted
 wo ram main or mustafa main fark nahin karte the
 Now people who know you are better because they do not believe in Eid
 banaaya jaae shiv mandirsaraakar par tanj kasate hue unhone kaha ki sarkaar kaa aglaa yah kadam hoga ki musalmaan apnaanaam bhi badalane lage
 Azam Khan said something like this on the question asked about bjp's 2019 election preparations, see if the Bharatiya Janata Party has to prepare for 2019, then listen to us or give jobs to 10 crore youth as promised
 modi ko badshaah kehete hueajam khaanne kaha ki badshaah ne daawa kiya tha ki har saal 2 karod logon ko naukari milegi, lekin kaha he naukari
 He challenged the government and said that the Chalatajmahal should be demolished and made into a Shiv temple
 ham kah to rahe hai ki chalo tajmahal giraate hai
 Why won't Shiva's temple be built? babari masjid giraayi ja sakati he kyonki uski koi keemat nahin thi, usase koi aamadani nahin hoti thi
 The Taj Mahal will not be demolished because it earns crores
 ajam khan ne me tu maamle main ghirakar apana istipha dene vaale emje akbar ke maamle par unhone kaha ki bhartiya janata party ko yaa kam se kam pradhanmantri ji ko baat saaf kerani chahie or jo bhi mahasoos karte hai wo kahana chahie

 com / kaeaemiij9 desh kii rajdhani dilli main junior level kii ek neshnal kabddi khilaadi ke saath rape kii vaardaat ko anjaam dene vaale aaropee coach ko police ne giraftaar kar liya he
 The name of the accused is being described as Naresh Dahiya (46), who used to give wrestling training to wrestlers at Chhatrasal Stadium
 kuch maheene hi donon kaa parichay hua tha
 According to the information, a junior level National Kabaddi player in Delhi alleged that she went to Chhatrasal Stadium on 9 July
 vahaan use aaropee coach mila tha
 He made the kabaddi player sit in his car on the pretext of turning around
 kuch dur aage jaakar aaropee ne uske gardan par ghunsa maar diya, jisase wo behosh ho gai
 When she regained consciousness, she was in a flat
 iske baad aaropee ne uske saath rape kiya
 She then fainted
 agle din aaropee peedita ko raste me chhod diya
 Threatened to kill on being told about the incident
 vaardaat ke kareeb ek saptaah baad peedita ne model toun thane main jaakar police ko shikaayat diya tha
 On the basis of the victim's statement and Tahrir, the police registered a case against the accused under Section 376 of the IPC and the Poxo Act
 peedita ke medical jaanch memrape kii pushtiho gai thi
 Kabaddi player has also played matches in Telangana in the year 2016
 stadium main khaane-pine ko lekar coach or peedita kii jaan-pahchaan hui thi
 It was the evening of November 8, 2016
 achaanak khabar ai ki pradhanmantri narendra modi televijan par raashtra ko sambodhit karenge
 There was tremendous speculation
 apane bhaashan main kuch hi der baad modi ne madhyaraatri se 500 or 1,000 rupye ke noton ko band karne ke apni sarkaar ke aitihaasik faisle kaa elaan kiya or iske saath hi us vakt chal rahi hindustan kii 86 fisadi mudra ko chalan se baahar kar diya gaya
 Modi said, "the notes of five hundred and thousand rupees which have been deposited by the anti-national and anti-social elements, will be left with a piece of waste paper
 ''phir yah bhi, "eemaandaar, kadi mehnat karne vaale logon ke hakon or hiton kii puri hifaazat kii jaaegi
 "the next morning as the sky broke
" log band noton ko nai mudra se badalawaane ke liye umad pade
 Bad queues were set up in front of the banks
 bhartiya rigerv bank (arabiai) or saarvajanik tathaa nijee bainkon ko is baari-bharkam kavayad kii bhayavahata ne leel liya
 atms become empty
 dhan kii nikasi main katautee karne or nakadi kaa pravaah banaae rakhane ke liye kendriya bank ko ek ke baad ek farmaan jari karne pade
 The government remained firm that all this disaster was just a one-time bitter pill and the country needed it to end the evil of black money
 yah afasana kaam kar gaya
 The Indians were no less troubled by the acute cash crisis
 magar aam aadmi ne sochaa ki "bade noton ko jamaa karke rakhane waalon ko sajaa milegi kyonki unki kaali kamai ab kabhi banking vyavastha main lautakar nahin aa paaegi
 "some understood that the RBI would receive a huge dividend when the money was recovered, which it would hand over to the government to spend on infrastructure and social welfare
" yah sab bilkul sochaa-samajha or nattejey dene vaala maaloom detaa tha
 It just happened that after two years, an RBI report changed the picture and see how
 29 agast ko jari arabiai kii salanaa report kahati he ki band kiye gaye 99
 3 per cent note, which totals 15
 3 lakh karod rupye mulya ke the, banking vyavastha main laut aae hai
 Of the total notes, only 10,720 crore rupees can be owned
 to kya jis notebandi ko endie sarkaar kaale dhan par apana sabase bada hamalaa kahkar itaraati nahin thak rahi thi, vah apane makasad main naakaam rahi he? kya logon or kaarobaar ne phijul hi itani mushkilen jhelin?kya kaale dhan ke jamaakhoron ne banking vyavastha ko jhansa dekar apni avaidh nakadi ke bade hisse ko safed kar liya? agar aisa hua he, to yah hamaari banking vyavastha kii dakshata ke bare main kya bayaan karata he? landan skool of iconomics main arthshaastra ke professor maithrish ghatak kehete hai, "yah (notebandi) puri tarah naakaam rahi he
 The tragedy is that all of this could be understood beforehand
 ''aarthik jattackejanata ko hui dushwariyon ke alaava notebandi ne arthvyavastha main bhi chautarafa uthalputhal machaa di
 In the first four months of 2017 itself, 1
5 million jobs were lost
 yah jahiraa taur par notebandi or nivesh main tej giravat kii vajah se hua, haalanki kuch arthshaastriyon kaa kahana he ki naukariyon ke bharosemand aankade ab bhi maujuud nahin hai
 But the tell-tale evidence suggests that jobs must have gone because thousands of cash-dependent businesses had to be closed and contract workers sent back home
 real estate project thap pad gaye or maang ke girane se trakon ke trek fal or subjiyan mandiyon main pade-pade sad gaye
 This brought down prices and hurt the farmers
 arabiai ke aankadon ne bataaya ki 23 disambar, 2016 ko khatm hue pakhwaade main bank ke karj kii vruddhi dar girakar 5
 1 per cent, its lowest level in 60 years
 vajah yah thi ki kaarobaaron ne girti maang kii vajah se karj yaa udhaar lene main katautee kar di
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called the demonetisation "organized robbery and legally robbery" and warned of catastrophic economic consequences
 vaaki aisa hua bhi
 Growth in the country's GDP in april-june 2017 due to the fall of manufacturing to a three-year low of 5
 7 fisadi par aa gai
 The GDP or economy size was Rs 137 lakh crore in 2015-16
 jidipi main ek pratishat ank kii giravat kaa matlab he 1
 To lose money from the economic work of Rs 37 lakh crore
 haalanki vruddhi dar par kai baton kaa asar padaa ho saktaa he, masalan maal or seva kar (jiesti) kaa, jise notebandi ke aath maheenon baad anjaam diya gaya
 So it is difficult to blame demonetisation only for the slowing of the economy, but this was really a big reason for the decline in India's economic growth
 haal main ai report kahati hai ki laghu or chote kaarobaar ab bhi notebandi ke asar or jiesti vyavastha kii hichkole khaati shuruyaat se chatapata rahe hai
 The latest RBI figures (accessed through a newspaper's RTI) show that the loan default margin of these firms has doubled over the past year - from Rs 8,249 crore in March 2017 to Rs 16,118 crore in March 2018
 to kya 3 lakh karod rupye ke kalpit kaale dhan ko "swaha'' karne kii koshish main arthvyavastha ne bahut badi keemat chukaai he? ghatak kehete hai, "mote taur par nakadi par nirbhar anaupchaarik kshetra jidipi main 40 fisadi kaa yogadan detaa he or 80 fisadi kaarybal ko kaam muhaiyaa karata he
 It has probably suffered the biggest setback of the recession in independent India
 '' chote kaarobaaron kii badahaali ne hi rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke mukhiya mohan bhagwat ko bhi chote or majhole udhyamiyon ke liye vishesh suraksha upayon kii maang karne ke liye prerit or vivash kar diya
 Ashok Ranade, chief economist at the Aditya Birla Group, says, "if the purpose of demonetisation was to suddenly attack the illegitimate reserves of cash, it has failed
" agar iskaa makasad kaale dhan par lagaam kasnaa tha, to isamen bhi ise kamyaabi nahin mili
 Yes, it has been successful if this step was taken to ensure that every note of the currency gets into a legitimate bank account, which can then be tracked
 '' ve yah bhi kehete hai ki behisaab nakadi, notebandi ke baavjood chalan main rahegi or avaidh sampada paidaa hoti rahegi
 Troubled Times According to rbi's report on August 29, the currency trend is growing at the same pace and manner as it was in the first months of demonetisation
 jidipi ke saath nakadi kaa anupaat bahut thodaa-sa hi kam he or pakadi gai nakli mudra kii taadaad main koi khaas badlaav nahin aayaa he
 This evokes the theory that demonetisation has caused tremendous injury to the fake currency racket
 2017-18 main pakade gaye nakli noton kii taadaad takreeban utani hi he jitani vah notebandi ke pehle thi
 As it was becoming clear that most of the closed notes were returning to the system, the government started explaining the new purpose of demonetisation
 iske nakli noton ke khilaaf ladaai or aatank ke dhan ke sroton par lagaam kasne se lekar arthvyavastha ko aupchaarik banane or digital lenden ko badhaava dene jaise tamaam makasad bataae gaye
 The increase in tax compliance is now being boasted of as the biggest benefit of demonetisation
 hindustan kaa jidipi ke saath kar anupaat 21
 89 percent, which is lower than many relatively small countries
 masalan, hindustan iceland se 32 guna bada mulk he, par iceland kaa tex-jidipi anupaat hindustan ke anupaat se takreeban doguna he
 What is more surprising is that within a few hours of the rbi's annual report being made public, Arun Jaitley wrote in a blog: "number of income tax returns filed in March 2014 3
 8 karod thi
 This figure increased to 6 in 2017-18
 86 karod par pahunch gaya he
 When the impact of demonetisation and other steps is analyzed, the income tax returns have increased by 19 per cent and 26 per cent in the last two years
 ''ise "abhootpurv badhotaree'' bataate hue jetali ne kaha ki notebandi ke baad pichley do saal main daakhil nae ritern main 85
 5 lakhs and 1
 07 karod kaa ijapha hua he
 6 of Income Tax Collection 2013-14
 38 lakh karod rupye se badhkar 2017-18 main 10
 02 lakh crore rupees
 2017-18 main korporate karadaataaon ne 9,38,620 ritern daakhil kiye, jabaki 2016-17 main 8,01,115 ritern hi daakhil kiye the—yah 17
 There is a jump of 2 percent
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki kar anupaalan main badhotaree notebandi kaa ek saapeksh nateeja mana ja saktaa he, haalanki shuruyaat main iskaa yah makasad nahin bhi rahaa ho saktaa he
 Crisil's Chief Economist d
 ke
 Joshi says, "growth in tax collections can be a good correlation when growth is slow
 '' sarkari aankadon ke mutabik tamaam yojanaon, iskar chhaapon or survey ke jariye 1
 14 lakh crores worth of black money has been traced
 arthshaastri surajeet bhalla kaa kahana he ki notebandi ko keval vyavastha main noton ke lautne kii kasuti par aankna galat he
 He says, "even then the government and some people said that 2-3 lakh crore rupees will not come back in the system, because people will not want to let themselves be exposed
" ham bhole-bhaale the or hindustan ke bhrasht logon kii chaalaaki ko samaj nahin rahe the
 He found all the ways to change the note
 ''kai logon kii daleel he ki nae karadaataaon kii taadaad main ijapha mahaj isliye hua he ki unki aamadani ek nishchit seemaa ko paar kar gai he or isliye nahin ki ve kar anupaalak ban gaye hai
 Also, most of them are relatively low average income people
 masalan, 2016-17 ke aarthik surveykshan ke mutabik, 2016-17 main nae jude karadaataaon ne ausat salanaa aamadani 2
 7 lakh rupees
 notebandi ke saath dikkat yah he ki karadaataaon main bahut badi taadaad vetanbhogiyon, chote kaarobaariyon or peshewaron kii he, jo eemaandaaree se kar chukaate hai or phir bhi unhen mudra kii bandi ke nattejey bhugatne pade
 Not only this, tax collection has been much higher in previous years
 kerala ke civil ejeeniyar se aankadebaaji ke ustad bane or notebandi ke apane vishleshan se lokapriy hue james wilson ke mutabik, manmohan singh kii aguai main upie-2 ke dauraan 2011-12 (10
 7 percent) to 2012-13 (13
 6 fisadi) se 2013-14 (14
 2 per cent) has been a trend of increasing direct tax collections at a steady pace
 magar modi sarkaar ke maatahat salanaa badhotaree girakar 2014-15 main 8
 96 per cent and 6 in 2015-16
 63 fisadi par aa gai
 However during 2016–17 (14
 5 pratishat) isamen kuch sudhaar dikhaa, par wilson ke mutabik, yah 2015-16 ke nichle aadhaar kii vajah se tha
 It seems that tax compliance could have been improved even if the government had stayed with tax forgiveness plans instead of abruptly closing the currency
 aktubar 2016 main ek-baar anupaalan khidki kholane par kam se kam 65,250 karod rupye kii aghoshit sampatti aa gai thi jisase karon main 29,362 karod rupye hasil hue the
 The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, launched in December 2016, gave people with black money a chance to clean up by paying 50 per cent tax and fines and raised a total of Rs 5,000 crore
 2015 main videshon main kaala dhan rakhane waalon ke liye isi tarah kii ek yojana main aghoshit videshi aamadani or sampatti kii 644 ghoshnaaen kii gai thim or karon ke taur par mahaj 2,428 karod rupye hasil hue the
 In 1997, the then Finance Minister P
W
 chidambaram kii laai gai svaichhik aay ghoshnaa yojana main kul 9,760 karod rupye ke kar jutaaye gaye the
 Not only this, it is a question of bringing more value (rs 2,000) notes instead of 1,000 and 500 rupee notes, because it has made it easier to deposit black money
 saath hi, nai mudra laane kii vajah se noton kii chapai kii laagat 2015-16 main 3,421 karod rupye se doguni badhkar 2016-17 main 7,965 karod rupye ho gai
 Where is black money? Various agencies have estimated black money (it includes cash but not cash only) worth more than 30 lakh crore rupees which is about 20 percent of the country's GDP (world Bank says it was in 2007 23 of GDP
 7 pratishat tha) ke baraabar baithta he
 According to official data released by the Swiss Central Bank, there has been a spurt in the amount of money hidden by Swiss people and companies in Swiss banks and reached 73rd position in 2017
 bhalla kehete hai, "agar notebandi ke lakshyon main se ek, kaale dhan kaa pataa lagaana tha, to kareeb 1,48,000 vyaktiyon ne ausatan 32 karod rupye bainkon main jamaa kiye hai
 Some economists say that it is not so easy to differentiate between legitimate cash and black money in banks
 vikaas arthshaastri jyaan drej kehete hai, "sarkaar kaa daawa he ki vah bainkon main jamaa dhan main se vaid or kaale dhan ko alag-alag karne main juty he, lekin yah doodh main pani milaane ke baad pani ko doodh se alag karne jaisaa hi he
 The entire campaign was based on witchcraft economics
 ''sarkaar ke mutabik, november 2016 or march 2017 ke bich 900 samoohon par chhapemari hui or 900 karod rupye jabt hue
 It seized Rs 636 crore in cash while undisclosed income of Rs 7,961 crore was reported
 isi avadhi main, 8,239 surveykshanon se 6,745 karod rupye kii aghoshit aay kaa pataa lagaaya gaya
 Around 18 lakh cases were identified in which the deposits in banks did not match the income tax returns filed by the account holders or the depositors did not file the returns
 teen lakh se adhik aise vyaktiyon ko notice jari kiye gaye, jinhone 10 lakh rupye jamaa kiye the, lekin iskar ritern daakhil nahin kiya tha
 As a result, two lakh such people filed their returns and paid self assessment tax of Rs 6,416 crore
 haalanki, iskar ko lekar sarkaar kii badi nigaraanee or karrwai pareshaan karne vaali rahi he
 Former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha argues that given the large number of cases filed, the situation has become like a tax terrorism
 sinha sawaal karte hai ki kya itani baari sankhya main lambit maamalon ke niptaare ke liye iskar vibhaag kii koi purv taiyaari thi
 2, showing the government's authority on fake or shell companies 25 lakh aisi fermon kii pahchaan kii jinhone 2015-16 or 2016-17 main apane ritern daakhil nahin kiye or unhen notice bheje gaye
 Now, there is a dire need to connect it with tools like Artificial Intelligence to analyze the data in real time and to decide that shell companies do not thrive again
 sutron ke mutabik, kaale dhan ko turant khoj nikaalane se zyada, sarkaar ek lakeer khinchne main safal rahi he jise pakadakar iskar adhikari apni jaanch ko aage badha sakate hai
 In August 2017, Modi said that around 1 in 18 lakh people as well as deposited in banks

 For the real estate sector, in which black money has been consumed, demonetisation was expected to bring transparency so that prices reach practical levels and demand increases
 haalanki, yah kshetra pariyojnaon ko puraa karne main ho rahi atyadhik deree ke kaaran pehle se hi buree tarah prabhavit tha, usamen notebandi or real estate (viniman or vikaas) adhinium (aariaare) ke kaaran or mandi dekhi gai he
 Some reports suggest that large amounts of black money have been consumed in real estate, especially in transactions of property valued at Rs 3 crore or more
 india today ke july 2018 ke desh kaa mizaaj janamat surveykshan main, 44 pratishat kaa maananaa tha ki kaala dhan nae noton ke rup main bazaar main waapas pahunch chukaa he—aisa maanane waalon kii sankhya main pichley surveykshan ke mukaable saat pratishat kii vruddhi hui he
 Another strong argument in favor of digital initiative was that it would help in digitization of the economy
 nakadi ke bina len-dein kii takanic kaa prachlan badha he, isliye koi bhi arthvyavastha swaabhaavik rup se nakadi ke kam upyog kii ore badhati he, lekin aalochakon kaa maananaa tha ki sarkaar digitalykaran ko badhaane ke liye isliye bhi zyada jor de rahi he kyonki vah arthvyavastha se aprachlit hui nakadi ke badale main paryaapt nai nakadi dene main naakaam rahi he
 Former Finance Minister P
 chidambaram ne bina nakadi vaali arthvyavastha ke vichaar ko "mukhartapurna or kaalpanik aadarshyy vaala bataaya or kaha ki duniya ke sabhi bade deshon main 20 pratishat lenden nakadi main hota he
 Recent figures show that cash dominance is still prevalent among Indian consumers
 arabiai ke aankadon se pataa chalata he ki april 2018 main 66 vibhinn bainkon se atm nikasi 2
 65 lakh crore Rs
 thi, jo pichley saal isi avadhi ke dauraan hui nikasi kii tulana main 22 pratishat adhik thi
 The RBI figures show that liquidity was at a record high this April
 notebandi se pehle jahaan logon ke paas 7
 8 lakh crore rupees, whereas today it more than doubled to 18
 5 lakh karod rupye ke str ko chhu gaya he
 This exposes the theory that demonetisation has led to a decrease in cash usage and increased digital transactions
 ghatak kehete hai, "mujhe aisa koi thos pramaan nahin dikhataa jo yah sabit kar sake ki notebandi ne arthvyavastha ke digitalykaran main madad kii he
 Just showing that people now have more options and they have become more digital than before does not prove anything because in a rapidly growing economy it all happens automatically over time anyway
 ''arthshaastri pronab sen kaa maananaa he ki arthvyavastha ke niyaman or digitalykaran main nishchit rup se badhotaree hui he
 "however, i believe that the main reason behind this change is GST and not demonetisation," says Sen
 jahaan tak digitalykaran kaa sawaal he, to nakadi ke upyog ko sarkaar dwaara pryojit bhugtan pranali (upiai, bhim ityadi) kii shuruyaat ke kaaran badhaava mila he na ki nakad lenden ko lekar logon ke man main samaae kisi dar ke kaaran
 "even if we consider the intention behind demonetisation to be good, then its preparations were very bad
 notebandi ke baad jiesti jaise doorgaami aarthik sudhaaron ko lagu kiye jane ke kaaran vikaas dar dhimi ho gai
 This led to a huge loss of jobs and a huge loss to the nation's wealth
 modi sarkaar ke liye acchhee khabar yah he ki arthvyavastha ke sadame se ubarne ke sanket milane lage hai
 The GDP figures released for the first quarter of 2018-19 show signs of improvement against the previous year's low base and 8 of them
 2 pratishat kii vruddhi dekhi gai he lekin shesh teen timahiyon main bhi ise barkaraar rakhane kii jarurat he
 The falling rupee value and the sharp rise in petrol prices have created a new challenge before the government
 sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki notebandi or jiesti, donon ke kaaran aage chalakar bhartiya arthvyavastha kii pareshaaniyon ko dur karne or vikaas dar main vruddhi kaa rasta khulegaa
 But the general perception about demonetisation is that it proved to be a failure and nothing was gained from it, whereas the general opinion about GST is that the government showed reckless haste to implement it and implemented it without full preparation
 july 2018 ke india today ke desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan main 73 pratishat ne kaha ki notebandi ne logon ko raahat se zyada dard diya he
 a year earlier survey figure was 61 per cent
 yah ullekhneey he ki pradhanmantri modi ne is saal swatantraaa diwas par laal kile se apane bhaashan ke dauraan ek baar bhi notebandi kaa zikr nahin kiya
 No other country in the world has dared to ban demonetisation on this size and scale
 jaahir he, iske sadame se puri tarah ubarne main thodaa vakt or lagegaa
 As Joshi of Crisil states, black money cannot be eradicated by any single event or endeavor, rather it is a process "monitoring is difficult in a vast country like India
 lekin digitalykaran ke saath log teji se apni vittiya gatividhiyon kaa ek nishaan chhod rahe hai or jiskaa adhikariyon dwaara pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 "tax-checking agencies should now chase the money trail to crack down on thieves

 Priya Ramani spoke- Akbar summoned in the bedroom, the old songrmani said in court - Akbar questioned the boyfriend on Saturday in Rouse Avenue Court, Delhi, in a defamation case filed by former Union Minister MJ Akbar against journalist Priya Ramani
 is dauraan priya ramani ne gavaahi di
 Priya Ramani made several revelations in her testimony and made sensational allegations on MJ Akbar
 court main priya ramani ne gavaahi kii shuruyaat apni padhai se kii
 He started his testimony in court and said, 'I graduated in 1991
 iske baad agast 1991 main masters in jarnalism ke liye america chali gai
 After coming back from there, i worked as a journalist in many media institutions
 meri pehali job saal 1994 main asian aij se shuru hui
 'priya Ramani told the court,' When i came back to India in November 1993 after doing Masters in Journalism from America, i started looking for a job in journalism
 maine mashhoor sampadak emje akbar ke bare main suna tha
 i grew up reading Akbar's articles and he was one of my professional heroes
 main sivi lekar asian aij akhbaar ke mumbai offis gai thi
 That day MJ Akbar came to Mumbai office and i met him
 iske baad usee din emje akbar ne mujhako shaam 7 baje oberoi hotel main intervyuu ke liye bulaayaa tha
 i said yes and i took the bus and left for Oberoi Hotel
 'priya ramani ne apni gavaahi main kaha, 'akbar se milane oberoi hotel jane se pehle maine apni dost nilufar venkataramana ko bulaayaa tha or intervyuu kii taiyaari main madad maangi thi
 After this i went to Nilufar Venkataraman's mother's office and we both discussed the interview
 venkataramana kii maa kaa offis oberoi hotel ke paas hi tha
 After this Nilufar Venkataraman left me the Oberoi Hotel
 'akbar ne mujhako apane bedroom main bulayapriya ramani ne kaha, 'jab main hotel pahunchi to lobby ke aasapaas dekhne lagi
 i hoped that Akbar would meet in the lobby of the hotel
 haalanki jab maine unako hotel ke lobby main nahin paaya to resepshan main jaakar akbar se baat karaane ko kaha
 He spoke to me on the phone and called in his room
 main khamosh ho gai or hichkichane lagi
 After this, Akbar insisted and asked me to come into the room
 haalanki vah room nahin, balki akbar kaa bedroom tha
 i did not expect this
 mujhako lag rahaa tha ki meraa intervyuu coffee shop yaa phir hotel lobby main hoga
 Despite all this, i could not dare to say no
 main asahaj thi, lekin phir bhi akbar ke bedroom main gai
 i rang his room bell and Akbar replied and then i went inside
 'bedroom main akbar ne poocha- bwoyfriend he yaa nahinpriya ramani ne bataaya, 'akbar ke bedroom main main akeli thi
 During this time, Akbar asked me many personal questions ranging from studying abroad
 akbar ne yah bhi sawaal kiya ki meri shaadi hui he yaa nahin? meraa koi bwoyfriend he yaa nahin, lekin in sabakaa jawaab maine na main diya
 After this, Akbar raised many questions about my family
 'ramani boleen- akbar ne ofer kiya sharabpriya ramani ne apni gavaahi main kaha, 'akbar ne apane bedroom main mujhako sharaab ofer kii
 But i refused to drink
 iske baad akbar ne khud sharaab pi
 Then Akbar asked me about favorite music and when i answered, he started singing old Hindi songs
 in sab ghatnaon se main khud ko behad asahaj mahasoos kar rahi thi
 He did not discuss the art of writing, current affairs and journalism with me
 iske baad akbar bedroom main rakhe sopha par jaakar baith gaye or choti si jagah main mujhako aakar baithne ko kaha
 'ramani said in the court statement,' i was already scared, when Akbar asked to come and sit, i became worried about my safety
 mujhako laga ki akbar kaa bedroom chhodkar fouran nikal janaa chahie
 After this i stood up and said that i have to go
 iske baad main vahaan se taxi pakadakar nikal gai or apni dost nilufar venkataramana ko akbar ke bartaav ke bare main bataaya, to wo hairaan rah gai
 i did not tell this incident to my family, because if they knew about it, they would not let me do the job
 iske baad main asian aij akhbaar jwoin karne ko lekar asahaj thi, lekin yah meri pehali job thi or anubhav nahin tha
 So i had to join the job
 haalanki iske baad main akbar se akele main kabhi nahin mili
 i met him only during the meeting

 Kishore Kumar was banned from performing songs and shows
 kyonki unhone ek raajnneetik party ke liye campan karne se manaa kar diya tha
 Concerning people are getting scared, Karjakarvina said, 'the question is why the people who threatened us were not arrested? a film (padmavati) is being opposed
 bain kii maang ho rahi he
 Somebody is threatening to go beyond the statute and the constitution
 ye kaise ho rahaa he? unhone sonu nigam ko jaan se maarane kii dhamkee di, bhansaali ko dhamkee di, deepika ko maarane kii dhamkee di, aisa hone kyon diya ja rahaa he? sahamat hum ki aap virodh kar rahe hai or aapako iskaa adhikaar he

 But when we show one aspect of history, 'jauhar' (in Padmavati), intellectuals say that you are glorifying it
 agar aap sati par film banane jaae to log kahenge ki mahimamandit kar rahe hai
 Whereas what used to happen in those days, you just want to show it
 ham ye chaahate hai ki hamaari filmein nidar hon
 'shloka was taped in the house, Anuradha was found in films like a breakfilmor too
 Sensing Shilveena said,' We are as sensitive as politicians

 'the film industry is the best example of secularism in the country, Raveena said,' i can say by thumping that our industry which was before and what it is today is the best example of secularism in the country
 main yahaan kaam karti hum
 My father and husband also work here
 main bataanaa chaahuungi ki puri industry ek saath he
 'very bad phase for music, now not even Gulshan Kumar: Anuradhakya is it possible to become' Tu cheesi big hai mast-mast 'today? When Raveena was asked that in today's phase her song Mohra's song' Tu cheesi hai mast ' Is it possible to become 'cool'? He replied, 'I don't know

 There may have been a stir across the country on Gurmehar Kaur's comment, but the family of many martyrs do not consider Gurmehar wrong and calling those who misinterpret his words wrong

 Martyr Manoj Pandey's father Gopichand Pandey says that Gurmehar is the daughter of a martyr and no martyr's family can think of treason, there is no such thing in Gurmehar's comment which is against the country, no such thing is said Be in support of Pakistan
 gopichand pandey ne logon se apil kii ki voshahid ke pariwaron kii vyathaako samajhe or tab apni pratikraya den
 Martyr Manoj Pandey's father says that it is stupid to think that the daughter of a martyr will have any idea against the country, the need is to understand the real meaning of his statements

 The special thing is that even though Gopichandgurmehar's comments stand with Murmehar, the pro-kashmir slogans seem very angry

 jiske chalate wo bijepi ke nishane par aa gaye hai
 bjp's Gujarat in-charge Bhupendra Yadav on Monday targeted Rahul, saying that Congress campaigner and vice-president Rahul Gandhi is going to the very temple

 You did not build a Ram temple, people got votes by telling them so many lies and formed their government

 As far as the Chief Minister's face is concerned, it has been a tradition that after the Congress elections, the Congress mlas and high command decide who will be the Chief Minister

 No matter how big a blockbuster the film is or how much it has been liked by the people

 The Waqf Board has said to bring the final draft for the Ayodhya solution before 6 December this year
 jabaki 6 dinsbar 1992 ke din hi babari masjid ko karsevakon ne dhwast kar diya tha
 Shia Waqf Board President Wasim Rizvi is continuously raising his voice in favor of building the Ram temple
 wasim rizvi ne pitiai ko bataa kiraam mandir ke samadhaanke liye kai ham prastaav taiyaar kar rahe hai
 Only after negotiating with some of the petitioners related to the Ayodhya case, a proposal for a settlement will be prepared to settle the dispute peacefully, which will be ready by 6 December
 unhone kaha ayodhya kaa hal aapasi baatcheet se nikaala ja saktaa he
 Let me tell you that Wasim Rizveen, chairman of the upsia Waqf Board, had met the founder of Art of Living, Shri Sri Ravi Shankar in Bengaluru recently
 wasim rizvi ne vivaadit sthaan par mandir banane ke paksh main he
 He had said that he does not want to build a mosque at the disputed place, but to build the mosque in a far away Muslim population
 uttar pradesh hoicourt ke lakhanu bench ne 2010 main ayodhya maamle main faisla sunaate hue teen hisson main vivaadit sthaan ko baant diya tha
 Among them are the Sunni Waqf Board, Nirmohi Aakhra and Bhagwan Ramlala Party

 For this, all members of the board will also make public the proposal for taking consent

 In such a situation, the responsibility of advocating the Shia Waqf Board on behalf of the mosque is made
 lekin supreme court ne wasim rizvi ke halafname ko riject kar diya tha
 Wasim Rizvi says that the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has no authority over the Ayodhya case
 iske bare main faisla keval shiya board ko tay karne kaa adhikaar he
 About the meeting with Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, Wasim Rizvi said that we made our intentions known to him
 nyaayalay ke baahar ke niptaare ke liye kii gai pahal hinduon-muslim ko majboot banayega or isse desh main bhaichara bhi badhegaa
 Apart from Wasim Rizvi, members of the Muslim Personal Law Board and people associated with the Nirmohi Akhara on Ayodhya had met with Sri Sri Ravi Shankar
 haalanki muslim personal lau board isamen koi party nahin
 But the Muslim community has considerable influence

 rashtramandal khel mahasang ke pramukh mike fennell ne aaj yahaan kaha ki dilli ko in khelon kii mejabani se kaaphi phayda hua he kyonki isse unhen shahar ke dhaanche ko sudhaarney kaa mauka mila
 Fennell told reporters, 'you have to keep in mind that Delhi has not hosted any major competition since 1982
 yahaan 17 lakh log rahete hai or unhen is toornament kii mejabani kaa mauka mila
 He said that some of the stadiums in Delhi were very old and people needed new stadiums
 karnataka main ayogy tehraae gaye 15 vidhayakon kii seat par upachunaav karaae jaaen yaa phir in vidhayakon ko bhi chunaav ladane kii ijaajat di jaae, is par ab supreme court buudhvaar ko sunwaayee karegaa
 The Election Commission has declared by-elections in these seats
 isliye ayogy vidhayakon kaa kahana he ki unki yachika supreme court main pehle se hi lambit he
 If the by-elections are held, their petition will be nullified
 aapako bataa den ki darasal supreme court karnataka ke 17 ayogy vidhayakon dwaara tatkaaleen spikar ramesh kumaar ke aadesh ke khilaaf daayar yachikaaon kii ek yachika par sunwaayee kar rahaa he jisamen unke istife ko khaarij kar diya gaya tha or unhen 15 veen karnataka vidhansabha ke kaarykaal ke liye phir se vidhayak hone ke liye ayogy ghoshit kar diya tha
 Yeddyurappa of mlas cannot be included in the ministry as he was disqualified
 vidhayakon ne ayogy tehraae jane ko supreme court ke nirdeshon kaa spasht ulanghan bataaya kyonki sheersh adaalat ne spasht rup se kaha tha ki vishwaas mat ke dauraan sadan main upasthit hone ke liye baadhya karne ke liye spikar dwaara koi kadam nahin uthaaya ja saktaa
 He termed the allegations of disqualification on the Speaker under the provisions of the 10th Schedule as incorrect and stated that the decision was taken without a mandatory notice period
 unhone yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki adhyaksh ne samvidhan ke virgon kii vyakhya ko jaanboojhkar vikrut kiya
 Rebel mlas also argued that most of them had already resigned and instead of deciding on their resignation, the speaker disqualified them which is illegal
 yah bhi tark diya ki adhyaksh ne 'prakritik nyaay ke siddhant' kaa ulanghan kiya tha kyonki ayogyata se pehle koi sunwaayee nahin kii gai thi
 He says the speaker's orders passed on July 28 were "completely illegal, arbitrary and malicious", as he arbitrarily rejected the resignations while they were voluntary and genuine
 unhone kaha ki un logon ne 6 july ko istipha de diya tha, lekin spikar keaar ramesh kumaar ne congress party dwaara 10 july ko daayar "puri tarah se galat" yachika ke aadhaar par unhen ayogy ghoshit kar diya
 Advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing on behalf of the mlas, said that what the speaker did according to the rules is unconstitutional
 aise main maamle ko phir se spikar ke paas bheja janaa chahie kyonki apni baat rakhane ke liye vidhayakon ko niyam ke mutabik 7 dinon kaa samay nahin mila
 He said that the speaker disqualified till the entire assembly term i
e
 2023
 agar upachunaav hote hai to bhi unhen dobaaraa chunaav ladane kaa adhikaar he
 Mukul said that the speaker had asked the mlas to file a reply in case of disqualification within three days but the rule says that 7 days time is given
 spikar ne aadesh main kaha ki istipha kii arji kii khaarij hota he or aap puure turm ke liye ayogy qaraar die jate he jo ki sahi nahin he
 Even if by-elections are held, ineligible legislators should be allowed to contest elections because it is a constitutional right to contest
 vahiin chunaav ayog ne bhi kaha ki kisi ko bhi ayogyata ke aadhaar par chunaav ladane se nahin roka ja saktaa he

 media main ai ek report ke mutabik america prashasan pakistan se yah sunishchit karne ko kah rahaa he ki mumbai hamalon ke jimmedaar logon ko bharat ko pratyrpit karne kii bajaay desh ke bheetar hi sajaa di jaae
 The Dawn newspaper quoted US sources as saying that the Bush administration had told the Pak government that it would like the prosecution of those responsible for the Mumbai attacks to be brought to justice
 yah kadam america prashasan kii soch main spasht badlaav ko darshata he, kyonki isse pehle usne bharat sarkaar kii is maang kaa samarthan kiya tha ki kuch sandigdh bharat ko pratyrpit kar die jaaen
 This change in American thinking is probably felt by New Delhi as well, where on Thursday, Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee said that there is no tangible benefit of US pressure on Pakistan
 america adhikariyon ne pehle hamale ke jimmedaar logon ko bharat ko saunpe jane kii bhartiya maang kaa samarthan kiya tha, lekin yah mahasoos hone ke baad unki soch main badlaav aa gaya he ki pakistan sarkaar ke liye lashkar-e-taiyaba ke bade netaaon ko bharat ko saunpna aasaan nahin hoga
 In talks with US officials on the issue, Pakistan emphasized that the government would suffer unprecedented consequences from handing over Pakistani citizens to India, especially when there is no extradition treaty between the two countries
 report ke anusaar pakistan ne tark diya he, raajnneetik asthirataa se na sirf sarkaar kamjor hogi, balki afghanistan main taliban or alqaida ke khilaaf yuddh ko bhi isse nuksaan pahunch saktaa he, kyonki pakistan isamen mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa rahaa he

 aisa isliye kyonki unke vakt jo log bahut chote the, ab bahut bade ho gaye hai or vah khud pehle jawan the, lekin ab buudhe ho gaye hai
 For this reason, now is the time to not let his 'past time' collide with the present time
 puure 6 saal baad amar singh kii samaajawaadee party main ghar vaapasi hui he
 There was a time when he was the largest leader in the party after Mulayam
 tab mulaayam ne ek press conference main kaha tha ki vah or amar singh 'do jism-ek jaan' hai
 Mulayam Singh Yadav was the most responsible for expelling Amar Singh from the party
 kuch vakt pehle ek sammelan main unhone kaha tha ki 'sirf ek shaks tha, jo mujhe sabase zyada samajhataa tha
 i did not even say that he understood what i wanted
 ' Mulayam's brother Ram Gopal Yadav and Amil Singh's minister Azam Khan were openly opposed to Amar Singh's return
 yahi nahin akhilesh yadav bhi andar se unki vaapasi ke khilaaf the, kyonki amar singh ke jane ke baad in teenon logon kii party main haisiyat kaaphi bad gai thi

 For example, RK Dhawan had a great status during Indira Gandhiji, but after that Rajiv Gandhi preferred to work with Winston George instead of him
 unke baad jab sonia ain to unhone winston jorge ke bajaay madhavan sahab ke saath kaam karnaa pasand kiya
 Similarly, now there is a phase of youth in the Samajwadi Party
 ab akhilesh netaa hai, unki apni pasand or kaam karne kaa style he, isliye main apane past ko pregent se takaraane nahin dena chahta

 They do not even resort to makeup to conceal the wrinkles and ridges of their faces

 In contrast to his on-screen characters, he is quite self-conscious and refrains from speaking openly about political plans even a year after announcing his intention to enter politics

 For Rajinikanth, the film will skyrocket his superstar image and spark his electoral appeal or submerge his film star status and aspirations that have created a ruckus in Tamil Nadu politics
 vaaki yah vakt is umradraj sitare ke liye bulandi yaa gardish main pahunchane kaa he
 But Rajinikanth is unfazed
 ve chennai kelkadak ilaake poes garden ke apane nivas main india today ke saath khaas baatcheet main kehete hai ki ve kabhi bhi apane rajnatik kariyar ko us tarah filmon ke aasare nahin khinchenge jaise tamilnadu ke em
 Yes
 ramchandran or em
 Leaders like Karunanidhi did
 vajahah "meri filmein alag hai or meri jindagi bilkul alag
 Why should i mix the two? i get paid for playing characters in films, whether i like the role or not
 main raajnneeti main utaruunga to vah meraa apana faisla hoga
 i want to do new and different politics
 main 67 saal kaa ho chukaa hum, meri sehat bhi timaardaari kii maang karti he
 Politics is not easy in this age, it is not a flowery path
 baavjood iske, aapako halaat badalane hai, aisa badlaav jo raajnneeti main fark le aey (dekhen baatcheet)
 Nevertheless, those who consider these words of Rajinikanth to bring clarity in politics, can derive some immediate results from fear or confusion
 rajnikant ne mushkil daur dekhe hai
 It would not have been an easy journey to get to this point today, starting from the bus conductor in Jawani
 ve asia main sabase mahange filmi sitare hai
 Many of his 150 films have made a mark at the box office
 rajnikant ne sabit kiya he ki koi bhi imtihaan paas karne kii unamem kaabiliyat, dhairya or lagan he
 He was asked that you show lightning in movies, but why the turtle moves in political schemes? He said, "politics is a big game and also dangerous
 isliye mujhe puri saavdhaanee baratani he
 Then, the right time is very important
 ''vakt hameshaa hi rajnikant kii kamyaabi main ahm rahaa he, chaahe uchhaalkar honton main cigarette le lenaa ho yaa phir raajnneeti main utarane ke iraade kaa elaan ho
 Her popular dialogue in the superhit film Muttu is, "naan Ippo Varuvan, Ipadi Warvennu Yarkam Teriyatu
 aana vara vendiya neratile vandiven (kisi ko nahin maaloom main kaise aauungaa magar sahi vakt par aauungaa)
 Rajinikanth has been craving to enter politics for a long time but in December 2017, Chief Minister J
 jayalalita kii mrityu ke baad hi unhone mahasoos kiya ki netritv shoonyata ko bharne kaa vakt aa gaya he
 Then Jayalalithaa's rival, DMK veteran M
 karunanidhi bhi gambhir biimaar chal rahe the (kuch maheene baad hi unki mrityu ho gai)
 In such a situation, Rajinikanth created a huge panic by revealing his intention to enter politics
 tamilnadu kii raajnneeti main 1967 se hi do dravid partiyon kaa dabadabaa rahaa he—annadramuk yaa akhil bhartiya anna dravid munetra kadgam or dramuk yaa dravid munetra kadgam
 Both parties have a durable cadre and both have come to power alternately for one term in succession since 1984, until Jayalalithaa broke the line by winning two consecutive assembly elections in 2011 and 2016
 2011 or 2016 ke chunaavon main annadramuk or uske sahyogi dalon ne kramshah 51
 93 per cent and 41 per cent votes were received, while 39
 53 or 40 fisadi vot dramuk or usase judi partiyon kii jholii main gaye the
 In the 2016 election, the AIADMK and its allies won 134 seats in the 234-member assembly in Tamil Nadu, while the DMK along with its allies won 98 seats
 is bich, 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main annadramuk or uske sahyogi dalon ne 43
 Captured 3 per cent of the votes, while the DMK and its allies had 26 on the part
 8 fisadi vot aae
 The important thing is that during the last decade, all such alliances, which were neither led by the AIADMK nor the DMK, disappeared from the political plank and it became clear that they had no vote base
 siyaasi takat ke taur par ubharne ke liye rajnikant ko un voton ke ek achche-khaase bade hisse par kabja karnaa hoga jo philhal in donon dravid partiyon ke paas hai
 Karunanidhi had enthroned his son Stalin as the DMK leader even before his death, which is slowly filling the void created by his departure
 jayalalita kii maut ke baad annadramuk haalanki sarkaar main bani hui he, par vah bhitari ekajutata kho chuki he or satta ke liye dhakkapel kar rahe dhadon ke bich uthal-puthal badastoor jari he
 There is no clear leader in the party who has the kind of charisma and status as Jayalalithaa did
 jaankaron kii daleel he ki rajnikant annadramuk vot bank par nishaanaa saadh rahe hai, kyonki is party kaa koi netaa nahin he or ve khud aise netaa hai jisaki koi party nahin he
 In a conversation with India Today, Rajinikanth praised MGR and even Jayalalithaa, despite their differences with the two
 yah bhi hakeekat he ki 1996 main unhone jayalalita ke khilaaf chunaav prachaar kiya tha
 He also said good things about Narendra Modi
 bhaajapa ne rajya main haalanki do fisadi vot hi hasil kiye the, magar rajnikant pradhanmantri se bair mol lenaa nahin chaahate
 However, it is the AIADMK cadre on which Rajinikanth is targeting to win the election
 maujuuda sarkaar kaa kaarykaal 2021 tak he or tab tak sarkaar ko girane nahin dene ke liye party ke tamaam dhade kisi na kisi tarah ek-duusare ke saath mili hue hai
 In such a situation, Rajinikanth's mathematics says that he still has a lot of time
 koi bhi kadam uthaane se pehle ve annadramuk kii sarkaar se logon ke mohabhang ke shikhar par pahunchane kaa intjaar karte maaloom dete hai
 The silver screen star, meanwhile, focussed heavily on rajini makkal mandram (RMM): the new network of his fans and fans across the state and building a cadre of political activists and leaders at the grassroots level
 is
 aaramem hi abhi tak unki siyaasi chadhaai kii buniyaad rahaa he
 Some of his staunch supporters have been associated with him since the 1980s in a campaign to promote donations of blood and eyes
 har saal 12 disambar ko unki saalagirah ke maukey par shivi lagaate hai
 They can be used to take political leap at the right time
 rajnikant vakt se pehle toomar khadaa karke ain vakt par utsaah or urja khona nahin chaahate
 They are very cautious about the fact that fun-loving cinematographers and mobilizing voters are two different things
 aaramem ke sadsy rajnikant kii jari kii gai 36 pannon kii us neeli kitaab kaa bahut nishtha or eemaandaaree se paalan karte hai jisamen bataaya gaya he ki raajnneeti main unhen kis tarah aacharan karnaa chahie
 The cover of this book has Rajinikanth's picture and hand symbol immersed in contemplation, which was popularized by his film Baba
 isamen aaramem activist ke liye aadarshon or mulyon ko saaf-saaf samajhaayaa gaya he
 Rajinikanth has instructed the RMM to try hard to attract the attention of the younger generation and first-time voters and also share them with them on social media

 The org had already received a million hits and 3,00,00 registrations in the first 24 hours
 ve chaahate hai ki unke mureed tamaam umr ke logon se milakar bane aaramem ke sadasyon ke saath "sampurna kranti'' ke unke abhiyaan kaa hissaa bane
 Nevertheless, analysts estimate that till now only about 15 percent of the voters come
 yah acchhee shuruyaat he, par rajya main hukumat karne ke liye unhen kam se kam 35 fisadi voton kii darkaar hogi, vah bhi tab jab rajya main partiyon ke bich voton kaa titarafa bantwaaraa hota he
 That is why they need to win the support not only of those who are losing the AIADMK but also to attract a large percentage of DMK supporters with independent votes
 pichley saal 31 disambar ko jab rajnikant ne siyasat main daakhil hone ke apane faisle kaa elaan kiya tha, tab unhone "aadhyatmik raajnneeti'' ke apane vijan ko paribhaashit kiya tha ki yah jati yaa dharm kii chhaayaon se mukt vijan hoga
 He said that hard work, transparency, public service, honesty and casteless politics will be the foundation of his party
 unke samarthak maanate hai ki rajnikant kaa karishma or aaramem kader ke pakke iraade milakar tamilnadu ko dravid hukumat ke shikanje se aaazaad kar denge

 Rajinikanth, however, is taking such precaution that he is not labeled as a pro-bjp and does not have to risk losing minority votes
 raajnneeti main apni entry kaa elaan karne ke mushkil se ek maheene baad unhone aaramem kaa apana pehla logo badalakar isamen se camel or saanp hataa diya taaki doguna pakkaa kar saken ki unke tarj kii aadhyatmikta gaiyr-hinduon ko unki siyasat se dur or alag na kar de

 ve tamilnadu ke liye aaj ke vakt kii jarurat hai
 In an interview with India Today, Rajinikanth explained in great detail what are the important issues facing Tamil Nadu at this time
 ve maanate hai ki rajya main netritv kaa shunya he jo logon ko apni puri kshamta saakaar karne se roak rahaa he
 He has a clear opinion that "the first priority should be to eliminate poverty, generate employment, take care of the youth and economic growth to uplift the state

 Even then there is a demand for Rajinikanth

 Rajinikanth's political strategy team seems to be working on many fine things

 Rajinikanth is full of courageous experimentation of bringing new types of politics and politics - Tamil Nadu 2

 But at the moment, he is a man made army and in such a situation it is difficult for Rajinikanth to emerge as a superhero in real life for the people of Tamil Nadu

 Shivraj Singh Chauhan's crisis can be gauged from Shivraj Singh Chauhan's difficulty that he fielded his entire cabinet for campaigning in Kolaras and Mungavali, even Yajodhiraditya's aunt Yashodhara Raje
 jabaki sindhiya khandaan kii abhi tak ravaayat rahi he ki chunaav maidan main parivaar ke kisi sadsy ke khilaaf kisi ko nahin utarana he or na hi prachaar karnaa he
 But Chauhan, who is in trouble, has broken this tradition from Yashodhara Raje

 The ex-army chief and now Union Minister of State for External Affairs General VK Singh being murdered by crushing the head of an innocent man by spreading rumors in Dadri seems such a minor incident that he is not even ready to discuss it
 unhone kaha ki dadri hatyakand ko media or kuch log bevajaah tool de rahe hai
 Talking to reporters after the release of his autobiography 'courage and Sankalp' at Raj Bhavan on Saturday, VK Singh said that it was completely wrong to throw an incident
 purv senadhyaksh ne kaha, 'dadri kii ghatnako lekar desh kaa maahaul bevajaah kharaab kiya ja rahaa he
 Politics is being done about this

 Has he never thought in his mind that there is a need to return the prize for an event? ”on the question of Sudhir Kulkarni's face being soothed in Mumbai, General Singh said that the faces have turned black, have they Anyone voiced? Today people talk of saffronisation in everything

 teej-tyohaar ho yaa puja-paath har kaam main is pavitra paudhe kii pattiyon ko istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The importance of Tulsi increases even more especially in the month of Kartik
 karthik maah main bhagwaan srihari kipuja main tulsi chadhaaneka fal 10,000 godaan ke baraabar mana gaya he
 The benefit is doubled by reciting and listening to Tulsi Namashtak
 jin danpatiyon ko santan kaa sukh naa mila ho, unhen bhi tulsi puja kerani chahie
 By the way, lamps should be lit in front of Tulsi in the whole month of Kartik, but if you have not lit the lamp for any reason, then on the day of Kartik Purnima, burn all 31 lamps and wish good luck for your home and family
 tulsi aradhana se labhbhagwan vishnu ko tulsi bahut priy hai or keval tulsi dal arpit karke srihari ko prasann kiya ja saktaa he
 It is said in the scriptures that Lord Vishnu never avoids the talk of Tulsi ji
 isliye agar tulsi mata prasann ho jaaen to sab takaliphen dur ho jaati hai or sabhi manokamanaayen purna ho jaati hai
 The basil plant has always been the center of faith
 teej-tyohaar ho yaa puja-paath har kaam main is pavitra paudhe kii pattiyon ko istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The importance of Tulsi increases even more especially in the month of Kartik, 15 full moon days occur in a year
 
 
 adhikmas yaa malmaas main ye sankhya 16 ho jaati he lekin in sabhi main karthik kii poornima sabase uttam sanyog lekar aati he
 Tulsi Puja will be done, according to the Kalyanasastras, the leaves of Tulsi should not be broken in some special days
 ekadshi, ravivaar, surya grahan or chandra grahan ke vakt tulsi kii pattiyon ko nahin todna chahie
 In vain, breaking the basil leaf causes blame
 shaam ke vakt tulsi ke paas diya jalaane se lakshmi kii krupa sadaiv bani rahati he
 If there is a basil plant in the courtyard of the house, then all the architectural defects of your house will be erased
 ghar main hameshaa dhan laabh ke shubh sanket bane rahenge
 Tulsi plant protects the family from evil eyes
 tulsi kaa paudha nakaaratmak urja kaa bhi naash karata he
 It is considered inauspicious to keep a dry basil plant in the house
 paudha suukh gaya he to use kisi pavitra nadi, talab yaa kisi kune main pravaahit kar den
 Immediately after removing the dried plant, plant a new basil plant

 ghar main khaanaa tak na pakaa tha
 Today was the sixth day
 bachche skool chode, ghar main baithe, apni or saare parivaar kii jindagi bavaal kiye de rahe the
 The same beating, the same rage, the same enterprise as if it had not come
 kamabakhton ko yah bhi dhyaan nahin ki angrej chale gayi or jate-jate aisa gaharaa ghaav maar gayi jo varshon risataa rahegaa
 India has been tortured with such cruel hands and arms that thousands of arteries have been cut, rivers of blood are flowing
 kisi main itani shakti nahin ki taanka laga sake
 For a few days, the atmosphere of the city was getting so dirty that all the Muslims of the city were sitting in a kind of cold weather
 gharon main taale pade the or baahar police kaa paharaa tha
 And thus the pieces of liver were left to coral on the chest
 vaise civil lines main aman hi tha, jaisaa ki hota he
 This dirtyness bounces more where these children are
 jahaan garibi hoti he vahiin agyanta ke ghode par dharm ke dher bajabajate hai
 And these heaps have been trashed
 upar se punjab se aanewaalon kii sankhya din pratidin badhati hi ja rahi thi jisase alpsankhyakon ke dilon main khuf badhata hi ja rahaa tha
 Heaps of dirt were being rapidly trashed and the stench had crawled on the clean roads
 do sthanon par to khulaa pradarshan bhi hua
 But the Hindus and Muslims of the Marwar state are similar to each other in such a way that those outside of the name, face or even clothes can hardly identify them
 baahar vaale alpsankhyak log jo aasaani se pahachaane ja sakate the, wo to pandraa agast kii mahak paakar hi pakistan kii simaaon se khisak gayi the
 The old residents of the saved state, they neither had so much understanding nor did they have so much status that someone would sit and explain the problem of Pakistan and India
 jinhen samajhnaa tha, vah samaj chuke the or vah surakshit bhi ho chuke the
 The rest who went to hear that they got four grains of wheat and four loaves of bread in their hands, they were looting
 kyonki vahaan jaakar unhen yah bhi pataa chalaa ki chaar ser kaa gehun kharidne ke liye ek rupee kii bhi jarurat hoti he
 And for full bread, we have to give full rice
 or ye rupaya, athnniyaan na kisi dukaan main milin na hi kheton main ugin
 These were as difficult to obtain as they were for survival
 jab khullamakhulla ilaakon se alpsankhyakon ko nikaalane kaa nirnay liya gaya to badi kathinaayee saamne aayi
 The Thakurs made it clear that the public is such a knot that staff is needed to elect Muslims
 jo ki ek phaltu kharch he
 By the way, if you want to buy a piece of land for the refugees, then they can be evacuated
 jaanavar to rahete hi hai
 When you say, the forest should be cleaned
 ab shesh rah gayi kuch gine-chune parivaar jo yaa to maharaja ke chele-chapatte main se the or jinke jane kaa sawaal hi kahan
 And those who were bent to go were binding their beds
 hamaara parivaar bhi usee shrenee main aata tha
 It was not early
 magar inhone to aakar baukhala hi diya
 Still no one gave much importance
 vah to kisi ke kaan par juun tak na rengti or varshon saamaan na bandhta jo allaah bhala kare chhabba miyaan kaa, wo pintara na chalate
 The elder brother was about to leave, he was defeated by saying, what did Mian Chhabba decide to write 'pakistan Zindabad' on the school wall
 rupachand ji ke bacchon ne iskaa virodh kiya or uski jagah 'akhand bharat' likh diya
 The conclusion was that the shoe went away and the promise to erase each other from the earth
 baat bad gayi
 Even the police arrived and the few counts of Muslims left were filled in lorries and sent to homes
 ab suniye, ki jyonhi bachche ghar main aaye, hameshaa hanja, mahamari ke hawaale karanevaali maaen mamata se bekaraar hokar daudin or kaleje se laga liya
 And someday it would have come like a fight with the children of Roopchand ji, then the bride-in-law used to treat her with her shoes so that the tuba would be well picked and sent to Roopchand to give him a mixture of castor oil and corn, because Roopchand ji was not only our family doctor but also old friend of Abba
 doctor sahab kii dosti abba se, inke beton kii bhaaiyon se, bahuon kii hamaari bhavajon se, or nai paudh kii nai paudh se aapas main daantkaati dosti thi
 The current three generations of the two families were so entangled with each other that no one could have imagined that this love would break out after the Partition of India
 jabaki donon pariwaron main muslim ligi, congresi or mahasabhai maujuud the
 Religious and political debates were also fierce but similar to football or cricket matches
 idhar abba congresi the to udhar doctor sahab or bade bhai ligi the to udhar gyanachand mahasabhai, idhar manjhale bhai communist the to udhar gulabchand socialist or phir isi hisaab se mardon kii patniyaan or bachche bhi isi party ke the
 Usually, when the debate took place, the Congress would always have a heavy upper hand, Communists and Socialists would eat abuses but would enter the Congress itself
 batch jate mahasabhai or ligi
 These two would always accompany them, although they would be enemies of each other, yet both of them would attack the Congress together
 lekin idhar kuch saal se muslim lig kaa jor badhata ja rahaa tha or duusari ore mahasabha kaa
 The Congress was completely stunned
 bade bhai kii dekh-rekh main ghar kii sari paudh keval do-ek pakshpaat rahit congresiyon ko chhodkar neshnal guard kii tarah dat gayi
 Here, a small team of Sevak Sangh got stuck under the command of Gyanchand
 magar prem vahi rahaa pehle jaisaa
 “I will marry my son to Munni
 '' mahasabhai gyanachand ke ligi pita se kehete, ''sone ke paajeb laaounga
 '' 'don't knock the friend! '' arthath bade bhai gyanachand kii sahukaari par hamalaa karte hai
 And here the National Guard would write "pakistan Zindabad" on the walls and the Sevak Sangh team would scrape it and write "akhand Bharat"
 yah us samay kii ghatana he jab pakistan kaa len-dein ek hansane-hansaane kii baat thi
 Abba and Roopchand would listen to all this and smile and then started putting their intention to make everyone one
 ammaa or chachee raajnneeti se dur dhaniye, haldi or betiyon ke jahejon kii baaten kiya karatin or bahuen ek-duusare ke fishan churaane kii taak main lagi rahati, namak-mirch ke saath-saath doctor sahab ke yahan se davaayen bhi mangavaayi jaatin
 Every day someone came to sneeze and ran to the doctor or where someone got sick and Amma started making dal-filled roti and sent to the doctor to come, if you want to eat
 ab doctor sahab apane poton kaa haath pakade aa pahunche
 While walking, the wife would say, "don't listen to food
" xxrep 4 ' han to phir fees kaise vasuul karuun dekho ji lala or chunni ko bhej dena
 "" Hi Ram, you don't even feel sorry
 "aunty used to grumble
 majaa to tab aata jab kabhi ammaa kii tabiyat kharaab hoti or ammaa kaanp jaatin
 "no brother, i will not treat this clown
" '' magar ghar ke doctor ko chhodkar shahar se koun bulaane jaataa
 Doctor would come running as soon as he was called, "if you blow casserole alone, you will fall ill
" '' vah chillaate
 "you understand others as you eat", Amma roared from behind the curtain
 ''are ye beemaari kaa to bahaanaa he bhai, tum vaise hi kahala bheja karo, main aa jaae karunga
 These hypocrites make a lot of money '' wo aankhon main sharaarat jamaakar muskuraate or ammaa jal kar haath khinch leti or baaten sunaatin
 Abba would keep smiling
 ek marij ko dekhne aate to ghar ke saare rogi khadey ho jate
 If someone is walking with his stomach, then the boil of someone is gone
 kisi kaa kaan pak gaya he to kisi kii naak phuli padi he
 "what is the matter, Deputy Sir! i will poison a few
 kya mujhe 'salotaree' samaj rakhaa he ki duniya bhar ke jaanavar tut pade
 "he would look at the patients and smile
" or jahaan koi nayaa baccha janamane vaala hota to vah kehete- ''muft kaa doctor he paidaa kiye jaao kamabakht ke seene par kodo dalne ke liye
 "but as soon as the pain started, he would start circling our verandah from his verandah
 cheekh chinghad se sabko baukhala dete
 It is difficult even for the local people to come
 par jyonhi bachche kii pehali aawaaj inke kaanon main pahunchati vah baraamde se darwaja, daravaaje se kamare ke andar aa jate or inke saath abba bhi baawale hokar aa jate
 Women would get beaten up in the curtain
 bachche kii naadee dekhakar vah uski maan kii peeth thokate 'vaah meri sherni', or bachche kaa naal katkar use nahlaana shuru kar dete
 Abba panicked as a slut nurse
 phir ammaa chillaanaa shuru kar deteen,''lo gajab khuda kaa ye mard hai ki jaccha ghar main pile padate hai
 Sensing the situation, both of them ran out like a scolded child
 ab phir abba ke upar jab phaliz kaa hamalaa hua to rupachand ji aspataal se ritair ho chuke the or inaki sari practice inke or hamaare ghar tak hi simit rah gayi thi
 Many doctors were doing treatment, but with the nurse and Amma, only Dr
 Saheb would wake up, and from the time he came to bury Abba, he also realized responsibility in addition to family love
 bacchon kii fees maaf karaane skool daude jate
 Gyanchand's voice for dowry of girls and girls was closed
 ghar kaa koi bhi vishesh kaary bina doctor sahab kii raay ke na hota
 When the question of increasing the two rooms by breaking the western corner was raised, it was torn with the opinion of Dr
 Saheb
 ''usase upar do kamare badwa lo'', unhone raay di or vah maani gayi
 Fajan F
 e
 i was not ready to take science, Dr
 Sahib got cold with a shoe
 farida, miyaan se ladakar ghar aan baithi, doctor sahab ke paas uskaa pati pahunchaa or duusare din unki manjhali bahu shila jab byaah kar aayi to aayaa kaa jhagada bhi samaapt ho gaya
 The poor lady ran away from the hospital
 fees to dur kii cheez he upar se chathe din kurta-topi lekar aayi
 But today when Chhabba came after fighting, he was treated as if a brave man had come to hit the ground
 sabhi ne isaki bahaduree kaa varnan jaananaa chaha or bahut-si javaanon ke saamne ammaa gangi bani raheen
 Not from today, he had been silent since August 15, when Dr
 Saheb's home hoisted the tricolor flag and hoisted the flag of the league at his house
 in jhandon ke bich ek lambi khai kaa nirmaan ho chukaa tha
 Amma, whose terrible depths trembled with her sad eyes
 phir sharnaarthiyon kii sankhya badhane lagi
 The width of the trench widened when we came from Bahawalpur with the opportunity of a great daughter-in-law, by looting goods and somehow saving lives
 phir rawalpindi se jab nirmala ke sasuraal vaale murchhit avasthaa main aaye to is khai main ajgar phunfakaaren maarane lage
 When the younger sister-in-law sent to show the belly of her child, Sheela sister-in-law drove the servant away
 or kisi ne bhi is maamle par vaad-vivaad nahin chhedaa, saare ghar ke log ekadam ruk gayi
 The elder sister-in-law forgot to visit her hysteria and started packing her clothes
 ''mere trunk ko haath na lagaana'' ammaa kii jubaan ant main khuli or sabake sab hakkaa-bakka rah gayi
 "won't you go?" '' bade bhaiya taish se bole
 "naujmoi, i should go die in Sindh
" allaah maariyaan burke-pajame fadakaati phire hai
 "" Then go to Dheka near Dhaka
 xxrep 4 ' i wo dhake kaahe ko jaayengi
 There, like Bengalis, rice will be eaten with hands and arms
 '' sanjhali kii saas mamani bi ne taana diya
 "so Rawalpindi, let's go to Farida", said Khala
 ''tauba meri, allaah paak punjabiyon ke haathon mitti gandi na karaaye
 Have spoken the words of the destroyed donjkhi (hell dweller)
 '' aaj to meri kam bolne vaali ammaa patapat boleen
 "O aunt, you have got the same crush that under the high, you did not know your house sitting under the tree
" i bi yah kattu gilahari kii tarah gamjah mastiyaan ki raja ne bulaayaa he
 Take it, my brother sent an elephant chak-chak ye to kaala-kaala ki ghoda bheja, chak-chak ye to laaten jhaade ki
 
 
 Despite this the atmosphere was poisonous
 meri ammaa kaa munh jaraa-sa phool gaya
 "what are the talks of children?" '' neshnal guard ke sardaar ali bole
 "those who have no head, what is their intention to stay here and die cut
" xxrep 4 ' tum log jaao ab main kahan jaaongi apni antim ghadi main
 "" So, in the last clocks, will the convoys get past? "" Khala b used to count the potlines
 or potliyon main sone-chaandi ke gahanon se lakar karhadiyon kaa manjan, sukhi methi, or multani mitti tak thi
 She was taking these things with such a heart, as if the astral balance of Pakistan would be reduced
 teen baar bade bhai ne jalakar inaki puraane rohad kii potliyaan fekin
 But if they do not accept this wealth as such, then Pakistan will remain poor
 phir majaboor hokar bacchon kii maut main dubi hui gadelon kii rui kii potliyaan baandhani padin
 Pots were filled in sacks
 palangon ke pache-pattiyaan kholkar jhalangon main baandhi gayin, or dekhte hi dekhte jamaa jamaaya ghar tedi-medhi gathriyon or bogachon main parivartit ho gaya
 Now the legs of the goods have started
 thodaa sustaane ko baitha he abhi phir uthakar naachne lagegaa
 But Amma's trunk remained as it was
 ''aapa kaa iraadaa yaheen marane kaa he to inhen koun roak saktaa he'', bhai sahab ne ant main kaha
 And my innocent face Amma kept staring at the sky with wandering eyes, as if she herself asked you, who would kill? And when? '' Amma has been sated
 is umr main inaki budhdi thikaane par nahin he,'' manjhala bhai kaan main khusfusaaya
 "do you know that Kafirs have persecuted the innocent even more?" apana desh hoga to jaan-maal kii to suraksha hogi
 "if my little-spoken Amma had spoken, she would definitely say," Which bird's name is Apna Desh? Peoples! Where is your country? The soil in which it was born, in which it grew and grew and did not have its own country, then where will it go to settle down for four days and become its own country? And then who knows who will also remove someone from there
 kahe jaao nayaa desh basaao
 Now i am sitting here as a morning lamp
 ek nanha-sa jhonka aayaa or desh kaa jhagada samaapt or ye desh ujaad jane or basaane kaa khel madhur bhi to nahin
 One day the Mughals left their country and came to settle a new country
 aaj phir chalo desh basaane, desh na hua pair kii juuti ho gayi, thodaa kasi nahin ki utaar phenki or phir duusari pahan lee
 But Amma kept quiet
 ab inkaa cheharaa pehle se adhik thakaa hua maaloom hone laga
 Like she has been tired after searching for the country for hundreds of years and has lost herself in this search
 ammaa apni jagah aisi jami raheen jaise bad ke ped kii jad aandhi-tufaan main khadi rahati he
 But when the daughter, daughters-in-law, sons-in-law, grandchildren, nawas-nawasis, the whole population came out of the gate and rode in the lanes under the protection of the police, their hearts began flying
 baichaiyn nanjaron se inhone khai ke us paar bebasii se dekha
 The house in the middle of the road felt like a cloud in the cloud before it broke away
 rupachand ji kaa baramada sunsaan padaa tha
 Two or two children came out but were held back and dragged, but Amma's tears filled her eyes
 jo darwanje kii jhiriyon ke peeche geeli ho rahi thim
 When the larynx blew away the whole house, a dead man breathed shame
 darwaja khulaa or bojhil chaalon se rupachand ji choron kii tarah saamne ke khaali dhandan ghar ko taakane nikle or thodi der tak dhul ke gubaar main bichdi suuraton ko dhundte rahe or phir inaki asafal nigahen apradhi style main, is ujde darwanje se bhatakati hui waapas dharti main dhans gayin
 When Amma stood up in the courtyard after handing over the capital to all her age, her old heart was turned to death like a small child like ghosts would come from all over
 chakrakar inhone khambon kaa sahaara liya
 When the sun rose in front of me, the heart started coming
 yahi to vah cameraa tha jise duulhe kii pyaar bhari god main laanghakar aayi thim
 Here, the kamasin was veiled from the face of a naive bride with fearful eyes and who had written slavery for life
 vah saamne kone vaale kamare main pehali beti paidaa hui thi or badi beti kii yaad ekadam se kaundh banakar kaleje main samaa gayi
 His placenta was buried in the corner there
 ek nahin das naal gade the
 And ten souls took their first breath here
 das maance va haddi kii murtiyon ne,das inasaanon ne isi pavitra kamare main janm liya tha
 From this holy womb, which he left today and went away
