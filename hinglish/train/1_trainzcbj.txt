 
 dhoni-lekin aap abhi iskaa elaan mat kijiega
 
 
 First i will make my fellow players aware of my decision
 
 
 lekin sanjay se baat karne ke baad dhoni apane saathi khiladiyon ko apane sabase bade faisle se waakif karaate, usase pehle unhone apana ek ferj adaa kiya
 He went among journalists in a very calm manner
 jab dhoni melbern test main apni team kii kamyaabi-naakaami ke bare main bataa rahe the, us vakt unke chehre par koi aisa bhav nahin tha ki wo sharifon ke khel kii safed jersey utaarne kaa faisla kar chuke hai
 The press conference is over
 saathi khilaadiyon ne sochaa ki dhoni ab sidney vijay kii ranneeti banaaenge
 But here Dhoni was now going to do something else
 press conference se nikle to dressing room main apni team ke sabhi khilaadiyon ko bulaayaa
 Dhoni looked normal from above, but the sea of sentiment was rising inside
 khud ko sambhalate hue dhoni ne apane team member se kaha- doston, main test cricket chhod rahaa hum
 These seven words pushed all the runners of Youngistan into the depths of the Seven Hades
 koun soch saktaa tha ki dhoni ek jatke main test ko alavida bol denge
 Dhoni was just 10 steps away from the 100 Tests
 ek record ke liye das test or khel sakate the
 Or Dhoni could resign after the World Cup
 lekin aankadon or record kii bhulbhulaiya main bhatke, wo koi bhi ho jaae dhoni nahin ho saktaa
 The world knows that Dhoni is not hungry for any farewell, no fanfare or any boom
 kisi bhi khilaadi ne nahin sochaa tha ki dhoni achaanak aaenge or itnaa bada
 
 
 
 vaaki itnaa bada faisla suna denge
 Wherever he stood, he was shocked
 chaahe agle captain viraat kohli hon yaa gabbar kahe jane vaale shikhar dhawan
 Or Ajinkya Rahane or Cheteshwar Pujara or Rahul, who was picked by Dhoni at number 3
 sabhi bhavuk
 
 
 All silent
 
 
 lekin dressing room kii wo khamoshi sabase zyada cheekh rahi thi
 The captain who made the team number 1 in Tests
 usne naa koi daleel di, naa apil suni, bas sidhe aayaa or apana faisla kar liya
 Without making any sense on his face, Dhoni made big decisions
 vivaadon ko jhela
 Struggled with the attack of the opposing team
 jeeta lekin jeet kii khushi main kulaanche nahin bharaa
 But while saying goodbye to the team, Dhoni's eyes also did not support him, he cried, then it became difficult for the team to handle his tears

 'chaukeedaar chor he' ke naare ke saath rahul gandhi ne is baar loksabhaa chunaav ladaa or pradhanmantri narendra modi ko kadi chunauti dene kii koshish kii, lekin unka yah prayaas na sirf unke balki congress ke kisi kaam na aayaa
 This time too the Congress could not even open an account in many states and Rahul Gandhi himself lost the election from his reserved seat Amethi parliamentary seat to Smriti Irani
 karaari haar ke baad unhone party ke andar kade tevar dikhaae or adhyaksh pad chhodane kaa elaan kar diya, lekin padaadhikariyon ne unhen pad par bane rahane kaa anurodh kiya
 Now Rahul Gandhi is celebrating his 49th birthday on the 28th day of defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, but his birthday has come amidst many previous electoral failures
 loksabhaa chunaav ke tarikhon ke elaan se kaaphi pehle hi unhone apni chunavi taiyaari shuru kar di thi or akele apane dam par pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bhrashtachar or notebandi samet kai morchon par gherne kii koshish bhi kii, vah apane makasad main kai dfa kaamyaab hote dikh bhi rahe the, lekin unka prayaas aam janata ko rijhaane main naakaam rahaa or congress adhyaksh banane ke baad unhen jis loksabhaa chunaav main badi jeet kii aas thi, vahiin unhen karaari shikast kaa saamana karnaa pad gaya
 After becoming the President, the Congress was confined to the post of Congress President in Gujarat on December 16, before the assembly elections in Gujarat, it was believed that there will be a lot of passion inside the party and the party headed by the new chief is not just Narendra Modi and Will upset Amit Shah's unstoppable pair, but till date nothing like this has happened, left the victory in 3 states assembly elections 5 months ago a so every part of the Bharatiya Janata Party went gone from strength to strength while driving shrunken scope of Congress
 is baar rahul gandhi kaa saath dene priyanka gandhi wadra bhi maidan main utrin lekin naakaam raheen (photo-twitor)2014 main narendra modi jab centre kii satta par kabiz hue tab bhartiya janata party (bijepi) mahaj 7 rajyon main satta main thi jabaki congress kii 13 rajyon main satta thi, lekin march 2018 main 3 rajyon main hue vidhansabha chunaav ke baad bijepi kii 22 rajyon main sarkaar chal rahi thi to congress kii satta mahaj 4 rajyon (punjab, karnataka, mizoram or pudducheri) main simat gai
 However, as on date, Congress is running in 6 states (rajasthan, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Puducherry)
 loksabhaa chunaav ne kiya hataasharahul gandhi ke netritv main loksabhaa chunaav kii baat karen to is saal hue loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko 543 sansadeey siton main se mahaj 52 siton par hi jeet mili
 However, this time 8 seats (44 seats) were more in his account than in 2014
 party ke vot share main bhi sudhaar dikhaa
 This time the Congress's vote share in the general election 19
 5 fisadi rahaa, jo 2014 ke vot share (13
 6 percent)
 2019 main, congress jahaan 262 siton par vijeta yaa upavijeta kii sthiti main thi to 2014 main vah 268 siton par pehle yaa duusare sthaan par rahi thi
 Whereas 10 years ago, Congress was in a strong position on 350 seats
 is baar 11 rajyon or 5 centre shasit pradeshon (andhra pradesh, lakshadweep, dilli, daman or div, daadaraa or nagar haveli, chandigarh, uttarakhand, tripura, sikkim, rajasthan, nagaland, manipur, himachal pradesh, haryana, gujarat or arunachal pradesh) main khaataa tak nahin khul sakaa
 Rahul Gandhi is still waiting for a big victory (photo-manish Rajput) After failing in the first exam, in 2017, Congress president Rahul Gandhi's big test was to win the party in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh assembly elections, but Despite continuous efforts, he could not wrest bjp's power from Gujarat and the party was in power for the sixth consecutive time in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state
 Managed to retain e
 gujarat ke alaava himachal main congress ne apni satta ganvaa di
 Barring the by-elections in several Lok Sabha and Assembly seats in Karnataka's Number Two in 2018, the assembly elections of 9 states were fought on separate occasions, out of which 4 states had a face-to-face fight between the BJP and the Congress
 saal kii shuruyaat main farvari main tripura, meghalaya or nagaland main vidhansabha chunaav lade gaye jisamen meghalaya main congress ne apni satta ganvaa di, jabaki 2 anya rajyon main bhi uskaa pradarshan niraashajanak rahaa
 About 2 months after this, elections were held in Karnataka, the only bastion of the Congress in South India where it lost power, but it became number 2 in the common government
 12 may ko karnataka main vidhansabha chunaav hue jisamen sattarudh congress duusare number kii party bani, lekin sabase badi party banane vaali bijepi ko satta par kabiz hone se rokane ke liye congress ne janata dal secular (jedies) ke saath gathbandhan kar liya
 Even though the Congress managed to prevent the BJP from ruling, its major disadvantage was that it was forced to become the second party in the coalition and lost the post of Chief Minister
 is dauraan vahaan jabardast raajnneetik ghatnakram chalaa or sanshay tathaa sankat ke bich yah mili-juli sarkaar apana ek saal puraa karne main naakaam rahi
 The end of the year was a little happy for the Congress, which suffered losses in several states after Khushirahul Gandhi became party president 5 months ago, winning 3 out of 5 assembly elections held in november-december and consecutive defeats for the party
 Stopped the connection for a while
 chhattisgarh main congress ne bijepi ko satta se baahar karte hue banpar jeet hasil kii
 In Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, the Congress won, but the result was not as expected
 satta virdohi lahar ke baavjood bijepi ne chhattisgarh ko chhod madhya pradesh or rajasthan main ek baar phir shandaar pradarshan kiya or mahaj kuch siton ke antar se satta main vaapasi nahin kar saki
 The manner in which the Congress had to face defeat in the Lok Sabha elections held in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, about 5 months after returning to power, it seems that the Congress had won it by chance
 2017 main 2 jagah sarkaar banane se chukiisse pehle 2017 main 7 rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav lade gaye, jisamen punjab ko chhod diya jaae to anya rajyon (goa, uttarakhand, uttar pradesh, manipur, himachal pradesh or gujarat) main congress ko haar mili
 The local leadership also got credit for the Congress victory in Punjab
 goa main sabase badi party hone ke baavjood congress apane sust ravaiye ke chalate sarkaar banane kaa mauka ganvaa baithi thi
 Similarly, despite being the largest party in Manipur, the Congress missed an opportunity to form the government and their victory did not work in front of the aggressive attitude of the BJP
 uttar pradesh main march 2017 main vidhansabha chunaav hue the or is chunaav main bijepi ko haraane ke liye congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne samaajawaadee party ke saath apratyaashit gathbandhan karte hue ek saath chunaav ladane kaa faisla liya, lekin is gathbandhan ko karaari haar mili
 In the elections held in 403 seats in the state, BJP got 312 seats, Congress got only 7 seats, while under the agreement it contested 105 seats
 2016 main bhi haar kaa silsilaa jari2016 main april-may main 5 rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav karaae gaye the, jisamen sirf centre shasit pradesh pudducheri main hi congress satta par kabiz ho saki jabaki shesh chaaron main rajyon main party ko haar mili
 In Assam, the BJP gained power, West Bengal Mamata Banerjee's party Trinamool Congress (TMC) again returned to power
 jabaki kerala main congress kii aguwai vaale gathbandhan ko haraate hue sipiai ne satta pakad banaai to tamilnadu main ol india anna dravid munetra kadgam (ediemke) phir se satta main lauti, or congress kaa intjaar intjaar hi rah gaya
 In 2015, when the Congress failed to open an account in the Assembly elections in Delhi, in Bihar, the Congress came out in alliance with the Janata Dal United and Rashtriya Janata Dal and won the election, but this victory did not last long and in 2017 the public The party broke away from the United Alliance, leaving the Congress out of state power
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi 2014 kii tulana main 2019 main paripakv netaa ke rup main ubhare hai, is baar unhone jitani sanjidagi or gambhirtha se chunaav ladaa usase unhen bada netaa jarur bana diya
 It is another matter that his leadership has so far failed to convert votes despite constant struggle and efforts and this proved to be his biggest weakness
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle nyaay jaisi lubhaavni skim ke jariye janata kaa dil jeetne kii koshish kii, lekin yah prayaas bhi naakaam sabit hui
 Next year, Rahul Gandhi will turn 50 and now it has to be seen that after 5 years, when he will be 54 years of age in 2024, will he get the party even equal to his age in the next Lok Sabha elections to be held in the country at that time? Will succeed gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko aakhirkaar peeche hatana hi padaa
 Modi is breaking his silence that Advani is the nda's PM in waiting
 udyogajagat ne unako piem banane kii vakaalat kar di thi, jiske baad party main bhuuchaal aa gaya tha
 Narendra Modi rarely speaks about the politics going on in his party and even if he speaks, weigh it
 lekin piem in vatting kaa masalaa uthaa to unako apni jubaan kholani hi padi
 In fact, industrialists who came to invest in his state had told him PM in waiting and there was a lot of controversy in this BJP
 party alaakaman ne saaf kar diya ki modi ke liye dilli main philhal vaikency nahin hai
 Therefore, Modi had to come forward and sing Advani
 modi kii in chand dinon kii khamoshi ne sabko mushkil main daal diya tha
 Now the BJP has breathed a sigh of relief
 narendra modi ne tay kar liya he wo siem hi rahenge
 The post of PM in waiting is for Advani
 lekin modi ke is faisle ne duusari peedi ke netaaon main adwani ke baad koun kaa sawaal or pechida bana diya he
 Delhi's 123 prime property was given to the Waqf Board by the UPA government
 ab modi sarkaar isaki chaanbin karvaa rahi he
 Because the land is not in the name of Waqf that its rigging begins
 aaie samajhate hai vakf or uske ghapalon ko-vakf ek arabi shabd he, jiskaa matlab hota he vah property jo allaah ke naam par daan kii gai he
 So that it can be used for the good of the poor
 bharat main vakf sansthaaon kaa vajood 800 saal se he
 It began with caring for the lands donated by Muslim kings
 desh main ab vakf board ke naam kareeb teen lakh registerd property hai
 There is only about four lakh acres of land
 railway or dephence ke baad sabase zyada jameen vakf ke paas he
 But most properties are mired in controversies
 gadbadiyon kaa board-- deshbhar main vakf board ke ghapale lagbhag ek jaise hai
 The builder or businessman identifies the land of the Waqf and contacts the board members
 oune-paune daam par jameen bech di jaati he or sadasyon ko unka hissaa mil jaataa he
 - In the states where Waqf land is not easily sold, it is handed over to builders or traders on very easy lease
 yahaan bhi board ke sadasyon ko unka hissaa mil jaataa he, kyonki ve lij ke niyam kuch is tarah bana dete hai taaki property kaa aasaani se commercial upyog ho sake
 - Many buildings, hotels, malls and factories in the country stand on the Waqf land
 yaa to behad kam keemat par ye jaminen bech di gayi yaa phir bahut kam kiraye par muhaiyaa kara di gayi
 - It is expected that the Waqf will make money for the welfare of the Muslim community, but there is a glut of irregularity and corruption in the Waqf Board across the country
 is sanstha main javabdehi na ke baraabar he
 Alliances with leaders - There are currently 30 Waqf Boards in the country
 kisi bhi vakf board main kam se kam 5 sadsy hone chahie
 All these members are nominated by the State Governments
 yani ve hi is board main shaamil hote hai, jinhen us rajya kii sarkaar chaahati he
 - Only leaders who are unable to find a place in the government are able to become members in these boards
 - aise main garib muslim samudaay ke liye kuch khaas karne ke bajaae inaki najar hameshaa bhoomafia yaa atikaraman karne waalon se santhganth karne par rahati he
 According to the 1995 Waqf Act, there should be regular audit survey of all boards, but many governments did not do this intentionally
 islam khatre main he
 
 
 Whenever it comes to the investigation of corruption prevailing in the Waqf Board, the board members often repeat - 'islam is in danger'
 aisa kahkar ve khud ko bachaa rahe hote hai
 - Waqf has its own claim regarding the mausoleums and mausoleums being maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India, but the fight behind these religious claims is only for money
 atikaraman ko badhaava
 
 
 - The Board itself encroaches many monuments
 pehle muslimon se kaha jaataa he ki ve namaaj padhein
 Then it is declared a place of prayer and settlements are made nearby
 in avaidh bastiyon ke paas kii jameen ko bechnaa yaa lij par dena aasaan ho jaataa he
 The result of all these disturbances is that today 70 percent of Waqf properties in the country are victims of encroachment
 ye sab yaa to vakf board memberon kii meharbaani se he yaa phir sarkari mahakamon kii andekhi se

 haryana main bahumat se dur bhartiya janata partygopal kanda ne kiya bijepi ko samarthan kaa elaangitika sharma aatmahatya maamle main ja chuke hai gelbhartiya janata party haryana main bahumat ke aankade se dur rah gai he
 In the results on Thursday, the Bharatiya Janata Party has got a total of 40 seats, but to reach power, a magic number of 46 is needed
 aise main ab sarkaar banane ke liye 6 vidhayakon kii jarurat he or bhaajapa ne anya vidhayakon se sampark karnaa shuru kar diya he
 In this contact, a name has emerged which was once a part of controversies and on which there has been a political uproar in Haryana
 gopal kanda, ek airhostess ke aatmahatya karne ke maamle main vah jail kii salaakhon ke peeche ja chuke hai or ab haryana main kingmekar banakar saamne aae hai
 Haryana Lokhit Party candidate Gopal Kanda has won from Sirsa, but his only seat is going to play an important role in Haryana's power
 guuruuvaar ko nateezon ke baad gopal kanda, ek anya vidhayak ranjit singh chautaala ek chartd plane se dilli ke liye ravaanaa hue
 Here he met BJP acting president JP Nadda, with which it was also decided that he was going to support BJP
 gopal kanda kaa chunavi natijagopal kanda banavaayenge bijepi kii sarkaar?gopal kanda ke bhai govind kanda ne kaha he ki vah bhaajapa ke saath aa rahe hai or unke saath 5-6 vidhayak bhi sarkaar ke saath aa sakate hai
 In such a situation, the discussion is going on whether Gopal Kanda can play a big role in the Government of Haryana
 raajnneetik halkon main to is baat kii bhi charchaaen hai ki kya gopal kanda rajya sarkaar main mantri banane ja rahe hai? yaa sarkaar main ahm bhoomika main honge
 During the election campaign, Haryana's famous dancer Sapna Chaudhary campaigned in support of Gopal Kanda's party
 sapana choudhary ne beete dinon hi bhaajapa bhi jwine kii thi, prachaar ke dauraan kanda ke samarthan main unke prachaar karne par kaaphi bavaal bhi hua tha
 After the controversy, Congress and social media are questioning BJP
 youth congress ke vaibhav walia ne soshal media par ek puraani tasviir saajha kii he, jisamen bhaajapa ke kaaryakarta geetika sharma ke liye nyaay maang rahe hai or gopal kanda kii giraftaar kii maang kar rahe hai
 How did Gopal Kanda come into the discussion on the old picture that went viral on social media? Gopal Kanda became an important part of the discussion after the results on Thursday and started trending on social media
 2009 main vah nirdaleey ladakar vidhayak bane the, tabaki hooda sarkaar main unhen mantri bhi banaaya gaya tha
 Gopal Kanda has been one of the important personalities of the state, who dominates politics
 2012 main gopal kanda kii airline company main kaam karne vaali geetika sharma ne tab aatmahatya kar lee thi
 Gopal Kanda was named by Geetika Sharma in her suicide note, after which he came into national discussion
 kai dinon tak underground rahane ke baad gopal kanda ne baad main police ke saamne samarpan kar diya tha
 In this case, Gopal Kanda was charged with rape, abetment to suicide, criminal conspiracy
 raajnneetik dabaav main unhen sarkaar se istipha dena padaa tha
 However, the charges of rape were removed from him later
 ek vakt wo bhi tha jab bhartiya janata party ne sadakon par utar kar gopal kanda ke khilaaf pradarshan kiya tha, soshal media par is vakt aisi tasviren kaaphi viral ho rahi hai
 See the prowess of democracy that the prison connection with Raja Bhaiya is not breaking

 pad or gopneeyata kii shapath lekar upi sarkaar ke mantri bane raghuraaj pratap singh urf raja bhaiya ab bataur mantri uttar pradesh kii seva karenge or inaki seva kaa kshetra hoga jail
 Democracy has given the chance that even after becoming a minister, Raja Bhaiya should have a connection with the jail

 Kunda's independent MLA Raja Bhaiya, who has been accused in several serious cases including POTA and Gangster Act, has also been a minister in the government of Mulayam Singh in 2005
 shapath grahan ke baad bataur siem akhilesh yadav ne kaha tha ki raja bhaiya ke khilaaf sabhi mukademe raajnneetik sajeesh ke tahat darj kiye gaye hai
 By the way, Raja Bhaiya has never lost to Kunda

 On the Gujarat tour, BJP national president Amit Shah made sharp remarks on Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 unhone rahul gandhi se sawaal kiya ki jis yojana kii aadharshila aapke naanaa (jawahar laal nehru) ne rakhi thi, aapke pita (rajeev gandhi) ne use puraa kyon nahin kiya?ahmedabad main yuvaaon ko sambodhit karte hue amit shah ne kaha ki congress vikaas kii baat kar rahi he
 Shah said that Shahzade of Congress had just come here and was asking for the account of development
 magar jissardaar sarovar yojanaka shilanyas desh ke pehle pradhanmantri jawahar laal naheru ne kiya tha, uskaa kaam pradhanmantri narendra modi puraa kar rahe hai
 The BJP president explained the Sardar Sarovar Yojana with an example of his age
 unhone kaha ki is yojana kii shuruyaat mere janm se pehali hui thi
 Today i am 53 years old and now on the 17th, Narendra Modi will start by worshiping mother Narmada
 shah ne kaha, 'bhai rahul jahaan aap khadey hokar bhaashan de rahe the, vahaan gande pani kaa keechad tha, lekin aaj duniya se log riverfrant dekhne aate hai
 Shah also said that those people are asking questions, who did nothing for the development of Gujarat
 congress ke raaj main jatvaad main jeena padataa tha, karfue hua karata tha
 Addressing the youth through video conferencing, Amit Shah met the youth of the state in the Youth Town Hall organized under the 'adikham Gujarat' program at Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Auditorium, Ahmedabad

 Adikham means to move forward without bending
 unhone kaha ki yuva hi itihaas gadhata he, yuva hi parivartan kaa kaaran banataa he or desh ko aage badhaane kaa kaam bhi yuva hi karata he
 Pave the way to form the government of the welfare Bharatiya Janata Party
 unhone kaha ki shri narendra modi jab gujarat ke mukhyamantri the, to hamane 128 siton par jeet hasil kii thi, aaj ve pradhanmantri hai to hamen gujarat main ab 150 siten milani hi chahie
 Please tell that in the first week of September, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi went to Ahmedabad
 is dauraan unhone party kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit kiya tha
 Rahul had accused the Modi government that the decision of demonetisation has hurt the poor and stalled the pace of development
 gujarat main is saal ke aakhir tak vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 In such a situation, political rhetoric between the main rival BJP and Congress is also gaining momentum
 amit shah lagaataar gujarat par focus kar rahe hai
 At the same time, Ahmed Patel's victory in the Rajya Sabha elections has killed the Congress
 aise main donon dal ek duusare ko gherne kii har mumican koshish kar rahe hai
 Producer Ekta Kapoor is known for creating mystery in her shows
 ab unhone apane popular tivi sho ye he mohabbatein main ek nayaa twist daalaa he jiske peeche tarah-tarah ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai
 Actually, the plane of Karan Patel who plays Raman in this show has crashed
 aise main adaja lagaaya ja rahaa he ki sho main karan ke role ko khatm kar diya he kyonki vah big bos 13 main jane vaale hai
 Apart from this, it is also being said that Karan is disappearing from the show for a short time
 vah baad main phir vaapasi karenge
 It is also being told that when he returns on the show, he will have lost his memory like Mihir Virani of 'because Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi'
 aise bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki karan ne sho ke liye last seen shoot kar liya he or yahaan par unka role khatm ho jaataa he

 iskaa andeshaa na narendra modi ko rahaa hoga, na rajnath singh ko
 But till yesterday, the BJP, which is reeling in excitement, has been thunderstruck
 party ke pichley loksabhaa chunaavon main piem candidet rahe, sabase varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ne party ke sabhi padon se istipha de diya he
 In a letter to party president Rajnath Singh, Advani said that for some time, i have not been able to comfort myself in the party
 mujhe nahin lagata ki shyama prasad mukherjee, deen dayaal upaadhyaay or atal bihar vaajapeyi ne jis party ko banaaya, khadaa kiya, ye vahi party he
 This direction has deviated
 iske saath hi adwani ne kaha ki is patr ko meraa istipha samajha jaae
 Advani has resigned from the posts of Parliamentary Board, National Executive and Election Committee
 haalanki vah endie ke chairman bane rahenge yaa nahin, is par rukh abhi saaf nahin he
 NDA convenor Sharad Yadav, while commenting on Advani's resignation, hinted that his party would now look afresh to continue in the NDA
 bacor sharad yadav, ‘ham to endie main atal ji or adwani ji ke saath hi jude the
 All agreements were with him and in front
 ab vah nahin he, to hamen dekhnaa hoga ki aage kii raah kya ho
 Criticizing the BJP leadership, Sharad Yadav said that who becomes the head of the election committee is an internal matter of the party, but the kind of statements made by the leaders in Goa are against the philosophy of the NDA
 sharad yadav ne kaha ki aage kii ranneeti par faisla, sabhi sahyogi dalon se salaah ke baad hi kiya jayega
 Advani had mentioned Bhishma Pitamah lying on Shar Shayya in his blog on Sunday
 unhone dharm yuddh main lage krishna kaa bhi zikr kiya tha
 Since then, the process of assessments of his retirement had started
 bataaya ja rahaa tha ki chunaav prachaar cameti kaa adhyaksh banane ke baad jald hi narendra modi adwani se milane dilli aaenge
 Rajnath Singh has also reached Delhi today
 unhone istife kii khabar se pehle matbhedon kii baat ko nakaara tha
 But now everything has come to the fore
 adwani ne sangh prachaarak kii bhoomika chhodkar 1957 main jansangh kaa kaam sambhala tha
 He was then shifted from Rajasthan to Delhi and lived in the residence found by Atal Bihari Vajpayee as an MP
 dinadayal upaadhyaay kii hatya ke baad atal jansangh ke centre main aa gaye or adwani unke number tu kii haisiyat main
 Even after the formation of Bharatiya Janata Party in 1980, the same order of power remained
 1989 main adwani kii somnath se ayodhya rathyatra ke baad hi bijepi bulandiyon par pahunchni shuru hui
 In the 1984 elections, the BJP had two seats in the Lok Sabha, but in 1989 it increased to 88
 uske baad 1991 main bijepi ne upi, empi, rajasthan or himachal pradesh main sarkaar banaai
 In 1995, it was Advani who announced Atal Bihari Vajpayee's name as bjp's PM Pratidashi
 vaajapeyi ke satta main rahane ke dauraan hi adwani hameshaa grih mantri rahe
 In 2002, he was appointed Deputy Prime Minister
 padhein sambandhit khabaren:sushamaa ko bharosa, adwani ko manaa lenge2005 main jinna par tippanee ke chalate adwani ko chhodana padaa tha bijepi adhyaksh kaa pad
 
 
 So this is the game plan of Modi and BJP has been torn in BJP: Congress gets command, Congress's Advani's resignation is a side effect: Congress america videshmantri hillari clinton islamabad main pakistani netritv ke saath baatcheet karke un par hakkaani network ke khatme ke liye dabaav banaaengi, taaki padosi afghanistan main shanti prakriya sugam ho sake
 Diplomatic sources said Hillary was accompanied by CIA Chief General David Petross and Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey
 unhone kaha ki hillari paak raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari, pradhanmantri yusuf raja gilaani or sena pramukh general ashfak parvej kayaani sahit desh ke asainya evam sainya netritv ke saath baithak karengi
 Hillary's visit comes at a time when the level of us-pakistan relations has gone down
 darasal america ke varisht adhikariyon ne aarope lagaae the ki paak khufia agency iesai afghanistan main jang jari rakhane or america evam videshi balon par hamalaa karne ke liye hakkaani network kaa upyog kar rahi he
 After reports of deployment of US and Afghan forces along the afghanistan-pakistan border, General Kayani warned the US of any unilateral action in the tribal region
 is kshetra ko hakkaani network or anya aatankwaadi sanghathanon kaa khufia thikaana mana jaataa he
 Kayani on Wednesday told members of two parliamentary committees that Pakistan is a nuclear power, which cannot be compared with Iraq or Afghanistan
 unhone kaha ki america ko pakistan main koi ekatarfa karrwai karne se pehle 10 baar sochna padegaa

 Something like this suspended Gujarat IPS officer D
 ji
 The same happened with Vanzara
 jab unhen is baat kaa ehsaas hua to unhone 10 pannon kaa istipha-patr bhej diya
 The draft of his resignation increased the burden of the past on the shoulders of Narendra Modi
 vanjaaraa ne atirikt mukhya sachiv (grih) ko saunpe gaye apane istife main mukhyamantri par aarope lagaaya he ki unhone rajya ke vafaadaar police adhikariyon ko to farji muthbhed ke maamle main fansaa diya, par apane kareebi amit shah ko bachaa liya
 As expected, BJP spokespersons are defending Modi, but a faction within the party that was opposing his candidacy for the post of Prime Minister has received a huge dose
 kanoonee rup se bhi isse modi ke liye pareshaani bad sakati he
 Sources said Vanzara's letter would be considered an out-of-court confession and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) would have to be questioned afresh
 is maamle se jude ek senior vakil kehete hai, ''ab tak vanjaaraa ne maafee kii maang nahin kii he, lekin unke paas vikalp he
 His statement can be recorded before a magistrate under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CRPC)
 ve sarkari gavaah ban sakate hai, maafee paane kaa haq rakh sakate hai, basharte ve apane aparaadh kaa puraa byora den
 ”this would mean that Chief Minister Modi can be accused like Shah in this case
 shah 2003 se 2010 ke bich gujarat ke grih mantri the
 He was the main accused in the 2005 Sohrabuddin Shaikh killing his wife Kausar Bi and a witness Tulsiram Prajapati in a fake encounter
 hatya, jabaran vasuuli or apharan ke maamle main aaropee shah ko 2010 main giraftaar or teen maheene ke bheetar hi jamaanat par reeha kar diya gaya
 But Vanjara, who has been in jail for six years, claims that the police officers were just "field officers" who were following the orders of "policy makers" Modi and Shah
 kabhi modi ke bharosemand adhikari rahe vanjaaraa 2003 se 2006 ke bich gujarat main farji muthbhed ke sabhi chaar maamalon—soharabuddin, prajapati, ishrat jahaan or sadik jamaal—main aaropee hai
 The CBI is investigating these cases
 unhone shah par un police adhikariyon ko dhokhaa dene kaa aarope lagaaya he, ''jinhone desh kii suraksha ke liye apana balidaan diya
 He has also accused Shah of misleading the Chief Minister
 chitthee main vanjaaraa kii hataasha saaf najar aati he
 This letter has caused panic in the Modi camp
 haalanki modi chup hai or unhone apane khilaaf in aaropon kaa koi jawaab nahin diya he, lekin unke samarthak is baat se chintit hai ki is chitthee kii vajah se khulaason or aaropon kii baadh aa jaaegi
 This will also provide an excuse to open 32 other police officers accused and jailed in separate encounters in the state
 aisa hua to modi or shah kii museebataan bad jaaengi
 Sources close to Modi say that efforts are on to cool Vanzara's anger
 sutron ke mutabik, ''chargeshit daakhil hue bina hi vanjaaraa saat saal kii kaid jald puri kar lenge
 After seven years, it will be difficult for the court to deny him bail
 unhen dhairya rakhane ke liye samajhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Also promised to take care of his family
 ”modi kii ''istemaal karo or pallaa jhaado” kii niti se sirf police adhikari hi naaraaz nahin hai
 Many in the party were also very upset with him when Shah was brought to Delhi as party general secretary in March on Modi's request and was later put in charge of an important state like Uttar Pradesh
 aisa rajya jo 2014 main modi kaa bhagya tay kar saktaa he
 There was a lot of resentment among the senior leaders of the party in the capital as the Modi and Shah pair were trying to establish their dominance by bypassing other members
 party main modi se naaraaz ek netaa kaa kahana he, ''ye mudde modi ke liye mushkil paidaa karenge
 After Godhra in 2002, it has now become a big problem
 modi kaa ateet unka peechha kar rahaa he
 It is not just about legal matters
 kya yah unhen desh kii sarvocch kursi par baithne degaa?”bijepi ke ek anya netaa kehete hai, ''raajnneeti main modi kii ek chatur ranneetikaar or desh kii suraksha ke liye ek yoddha kii chhavi ko isse tagada jhatka pahunchaa he
 His excessive reliance on Amit Shah would be harmful
 kisi netaa ko dusron kii andekhi karke maatr ek vyakti par nirbhar nahin rahanaa chahie
 The confusion of those who used to praise Modi is being broken
 misaal ke taur par, modi ko apana bhagwaan maanane vaale vanjaaraa kehete hai ki shah ke prabhaav main jarurat ke vakt modi unka saath nahin de paae
 Insiders say that Shah is the only leader in the party who fully understands Modi's mind and his political strategy, which is why he became indispensable to Modi
 vanjaaraa kii chitthee ke baad shah ab jaldi hi modi ke liye boj banane vaale hai
 The seeds of discontent in the minds of Vanzara and perhaps other police officers fell in November 2012, when Shah's lawyer Ram Jethmalani told the Supreme Court that if the two-year ban on Shah's entry into the state was lifted
 Shah has no objection to the trial being taken out of Gujarat
 iske baad shah ko to apane griharajya main pravesh kii ijaajat mil gai lekin jail main band 32 adhikariyon ko ahmedabad se hataakar maharashtra ke taloja jail bhej diya gaya
 The Supreme Court later fixed the trial in the same state
 isse in band police afasaron ko sandesh gaya ki modi gujarat main shah kii vaapasi karaane ke liye unke hiton ko taak par rakhana chaahate hai
 Sources close to Shah say that Congress people may have a hand in instigating police officers
 loksabhaa chunaavon ko dhyaan main rakhkar congress ke ranneetikaar har tarah kii tikadam aajamaane main jute gaye hai
 Shah should have been forewarned that Congress strategists could throw a trap on the jailed police officers
 unhen modi or unke khilaaf istemaal kar sakate hai
 Suspicions were being raised only when four Gujarat police officers, including IPS Girish Singhal, who was recently granted bail in the Ishrat Jahan case, agreed to disclose evidence against the Modi government in the case
 gauratlab he ki soharabuddin maamle main 12 janvari, 2010 ko sibiai jaanch ke aadesh ko lekar purvaagrah ke aarope lage the
 Tarun Chatterjee, one of the two judges who ordered the CBI inquiry, was to retire after two days
 sanyog se unhone yah aadesh jis din diya, usee din unhen centre kii ore se seemaa vivaad tribunel kaa adhyaksh niyukt kiya gaya
 Aftab Alam, the second judge, was made the chairman of the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) earlier this year within three months of his retirement
 kisi tarah modi ke funsane kaa intjaar kar rahi congress ko vanjaaraa kii chitthee ne munh-maangi muraad dilaa di he
 Congress leader Renuka Chaudhary told the media, "if Asaram can be arrested then why can't Modi be arrested in the fake encounter case after Vanzara's revelations?" The wave of uproar against Modi has triggered a wave of enthusiasm in the Congress
 unhen bina kisi mashkkat ke aasaani se modi ke khilaaf mudde mil rahe hai
 In fact, under Ajay Maken, the media department of the Congress became fully active on 2 and 3 September, when a freelance journalist, in a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court on 2 September, alleged that BJP mps Prakash Javadekar and Bhupendra Singh Yadav had filed Prajapati fake encounter case
 i tried to influence the investigation
 patrkaar ne apane aarope ke samarthan main sidi bhi supreme court ko saunpi thi
 The Congress media team closely watched the CD at Maken's house at 10, Pandit Pant Marg and then decided to target Modi
 maakan ke shabdon main, ''sidi ko dekhne se jo tathy saamne aate hai ve behad gambhir or ahm hai
 This is an attempt to influence a fair judicial inquiry
 sibiai ko is maamle kii chaanbin kerani chahie or jab tak jaanch puri na ho jaae, modi ko apane pad par nahin rahanaa chahie
 He should resign
 ”haalanki is maamle ne media main zyada tool nahin pakadaa, isliye jab vanjaaraa kaa istipha aayaa to congress ko apni kismat par ekbargi vishwaas hi nahin hua
 Maken, along with his colleagues, read this letter closely for two hours and made some statements out of it, and prepared his statement
 unhone 3 sitambar ko shaam 9
 Addressed the media at his home at 15 pm
 unka tha, ''mahatma gandhi ke rajya main aisa ho rahaa he ki 32 police adhikari maanavadhikaar hanan or muthbhed ke maamalon main jail main band hai
 Six of them are IPS officers
 chah anya ipies adhikariyon ke khilaaf maamla chal rahaa he
 Seeking cleanliness from the Gujarat government, he once again sought Modi's resignation
 modi ko bachaav kii mudra main paakar congress ne apni taraf se dabaav banaae rakhane kaa faisla kiya he
 With less than a year left in the Lok Sabha elections, the fight between Modi and the Congress can become even more bitter and ugly
 apane khilaaf tamaam ghotaalon or bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke baavjood congress ne khud ko bachaae rakhane kii kala main maharath hasil kar rakhi he
 Modi will need to show more courage now to beat the country's highest chair

 Indian captain Virat Kohli described Jasprit Bumrah as 'the best (fast) bowler in the world' and also said that he was afraid to face Perth on the bouncy wicket
 bumraah ne tisare test main 86 ran dekar kul nau wicket chatkaaye jisase bharat ne australia ko 137 ran se haraakar chaar maichon kii siries main 2-1 kii ajey badhat bana lee he
 Praising Bumrah, who took 48 wickets in his debut year in Test cricket, Kohli said, "according to me Jasprit is the best bowler in the world
 vah match vijeta he, isamen koi andeh nahin, phir bhale hi vah sirf 12 maheene se (test cricket) khel rahaa he
 'kohli said,' i mean to say that if there is a pitch like Perth, then to be honest, i do not want to face Jasprit Bumrah because if he gets into rhythm then he can demolish you
 vah jis tarah gendbaaji karata he vah kisi bhi anya gendbaaj se kaaphi alag he or mujhe lagata he ki vah ballebaaj se adhik ise mahasoos karata he
 This is why he is so confident about his skills
 ’melbern fatah ke baad in diggajon ne twitor par di team india ko badhaikohli ne kaha ki bumraah kii behtareen fitness or kaam ke prati eemaandaaree ke alaava unke kaushal ke kaaran unhone or mukhya coach ravi shastri ne dakshin africa daure se pehle unke naam par gambhirtha se vichaar kiya
 The Indian captain believes that Bumrah descends from a performance mindset instead of being irritated by the circumstances that make him the match winner
 captain ne kaha, ‘uski maansikta use philhal duniya ke anya gendbaajon se alag banaati he
 He looks at the pitch and does not think that there will be much effort on these wickets
 vah sochataa he ki main kaise team ke liye wicket hasil karun or aapaki maansikta aapako baakiyon se alag karti he
 The captain revealed that the bowling strategy is primarily composed by the bowler himself and as captain he only speaks when 'plan B' is needed
 team india se kohli-pujaara ko hataakar dekhen, hamaare jaisaa haal hoga: penunhone kaha, ‘eemaandaaree se kahuun to gendbaajon kii baithak main main aam taur par sirf baithkar sunata hum
 It is very important to understand what the bowlers are thinking and during this process you work on adherence b and you tell the bowlers about it
 ham aise hi kaam karte hai
 It was also seen in Bumrah's interview that how the team comes first
 kohli ne kaha, ‘yahaan tak ki match ke bare main bumraah kaa saakshaatkaar bhi is bare main tha ki main kaise team main yogadan de saktaa hum
 He did not get wickets in Perth, and the way he bowled here shows that he is not dispirited and he knows that he will get wickets at some point
 ’ Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was directly interacting with the students through the 'discussion on Examination' program for the first time, fiercely took the class of children's parents
 darasal, deshbhar ke chaatro ne parents kii apekshaaon ko lekar chaatro ne jis tarah se sawaal kiye usase laga ki wo inase pareshaan hai
 Students asked- every parent wants to be a doctor or an engineer
 hamaare ruchi kis cheez main he iske bare main nahin sochate
 Is this right? To which Modi said that 'I think i will have to take a parent class today'
 dilli main 'mekking exam fan: chat vid piem modi' main pradhanmantri ne kaha, sawaal student bhar kaa nahin he
 Parents are also asking some similar questions to explain to children
 unki maansikta sahi nahin he
 Modi said- Stop doubting parents
 wo aapke liye apni jindagi khapa dete hai
 It should be accepted that parents dream to see their child becoming something
 unki nishtha par shaq na karen
 The way to mutual understanding opens up on trust
 LIVE: PM modi kii 'pariksha par charchaa' shuru, chaatro ke sawaalon kaa de rahe hai javaabachatro ko salaah dete hue pradhanmantri ne kaha, mata-pita ko dekhakar padhai na karen
 a stressful environment causes havoc
 kai pitaaon ke saath aisa hota he ki wo apane sapane, bacchon main transplant karnaa chaahate hai
 Sometimes parents see their children's desire and desire to fulfill their unfulfilled dreams without seeing their upbringing
 modi ne ise ichchhaaon kaa bhoot qaraar diya
 Said- those ghosts grab you
 isse bachane ke liye jab pita achche mood main ho, to unase khulkar baat kerani chahie
 Modi quipped, "the child of India is a born leader
 bachche apni jarurat ke liye apana kaam nikaal lete hai
 They know how to find work through mother, grandmother, brother or sister
 bahan ne ek baar man bana liya to papa kii takat nahin he ki wo manaa kar den
 The same thing happens in our families
 pehali baar 6 lakh skulon ke 10 karod chaatro-adhyapakon sang pradhanmantri kii 'pariksha par charchaa'abhibhavakon ko salaahmodi ne kaha, main abhibhavakon se kahuunga isko jo soshal stats bana diya he ki meraa betaa ye karegaa wo karegaa, dusron ne kiya or mere ne nahin kiya to main munh dikhaane laayak nahin rahaa- ise band kar dijie
 Modi said, father in the society comes home after hearing the story of another child and thinks in my mind that my children are useless
 patni ko daantate hai - tuune bacchon ko kya sikhaaya
 As soon as you got home, you got in front then the game was over
 bacchon ne shiksha-pariksha par puche ye sawaal, modi ne die ye javabsoshal states na banaaenmodi ne kaha, main abhibhavakon se kahata hum ki aap in chizon ko soshal stats na banaaen
 Discuss the strength that is within your son
 dusron ke samarthy se use na dekhen
 There is something special in every child
 us par udhaar chijen na thope
 Do not pressurize children
 ank jindagi nahin hoti
 Is life a test? Look at Kalam
 wo fiter plane ke payalat bananaa chaahate the
 Failed kya wo fail ho gaye? nahin aage desh ko ek mahaan vaigyanik mila
 Modi said, so seeing the children of others should not evaluate and expect from their children
 bacchon se baatcheet karnaa chahie
 The family should have an open and healthy environment
 hamaare yahaan shastron main bhi he ki 18 saal kaa betaa-beti ho jaae to unhen mitra maananaa chahie
 Explain that about 100 million students and teachers from all over the country were connected through video conferencing at Talkatore Stadium, Delhi

 The Cricket World Cup started in 1975
 vanade cricket tab nayaa tha or cricketer test khilne ke liye jane jate the
 Then there was a 60-overs one-day match
 pehle world cap kaa pehla match bharat or england ke bich khelaa gaya or is match main bharat ke mahaan ballebaaj sunil gavaskar ne jo batting kii use aaj bhi vanade cricket kii sabase vivaadaaspad pari ke rup main yaad kiya jaataa he
 The match played at Lord's, on 7 June 1975, this match was played at Lord's called Mecca of Cricket
 tab garmi kaa mausam chal rahaa tha or pehle khelte hue england ne 60 overon main chaar wicket par 334 ranon kaa bada score khadaa kiya
 It was also the highest score of ODI cricket at that time
 england kii pari main denis amis (137) ne shatkeey or kith flechar (68) ne ardhashtakeey yogadan diya
 Chris Old then stole a superb Pachasa on just 30 balls
 toornament main tab aath timen thim jinhen do group main rakhaa gaya tha, yani ek haar agle daur kii sambhaavnaaon ko or ksheen kar detii
 All of them were assuming that India had lost the first match but then the format of the tournament was that if the points of any two teams are equal for going to the next round (semi-final) then the team whose net run rate will be good Will go ahead yani bharat ko haar ke baavjood adhik se adhik ran banane kii koshish kerani hogi
 India had played the first match in the history of the World Cup, this was the result of the innings played by Nithijavaskar, the fans who came running on the field, Sunil Gavaskar, who started the Indian innings, was just in his own tune that day
 wo vanade ko test kii bhaanti khilne lage
 There was disappointment among the Indian audience
 wo lagaataar dhimi gati se khele ja rahe the or udhar bhartiya darshakon kii naaraazgi itani bad gai ki unamem se kuch to field par daudte hue unke paas tak chale aae or unka virodh kiya
 On the other hand, disappointment was also visible on the faces of Gavaskar's teammates sitting in the pavilion
 mjedaar to yah rahaa ki gavaskar ne is pari main 174 ball khele or bagaiyr out hue 36 ran hi bana sake
 His strike rate is 20
 69 rahaa
 Thanks to his innings, Team India could manage only 132 runs at the loss of 3 wickets and lost the match by 202 runs
 itane bade antar se match haarane kaa yah world cap record ban gaya jo agle 27 saalon tak bana rahaa
 What was the reason behind this innings of Gavaskar, Team India manager GS Ramchand told the Daily Express newspaper, 'this is the most embarrassing performance of all the matches i have seen till date
 uskaa kahana tha ki wicket shot lagane ke liye bahut slo thi
 But it is stupid to say that England scored 334 runs on the same pitch
 team main niraashaa he
 The country's prestige is very important, which cannot be lost in this way
 ’kuch logon kii samaj main yah aayaa ki bhartiya team england kii pari ke baad yah maan chuki thi ki wo jeet nahin sakati or lords main isse pehle khele gaye antim match main puri team 42 ranon par out ho gai thi to sambhawatah team saste main ol out hone se bachanaa chaahati thi
 Sachin is at the pinnacle of records in the World Cup, so far no one has warmed up after this innings of Nangavaskar
 The market of rumors also got hot after this innings that Gavaskar was unhappy with the team's selection
 world cap ke liye chayan samiti ne tej gendbaajon kii tulana main spinneron ko tarjeeh di or yahi gavaskar kii naaraazgi kii vajah thi kyonki pichley england daure main spinners buree tarah naakaam rahe the
 There was also another rumor that he was unhappy with Venkataraghavan being elected captain
 gavaskar ne us samay to is pari ke bare main kuch bhi saarvajanik rup se nahin kaha lekin kai saalon ke baad unhone bhi yah mana ki wo unke jivan kii sabase ghatiya pari thi lekin saath hi unhone iskaa kaaran ‘out of form’ hona bataaya
 Gavaskar said that he also tried to get out during the match but could not get out
 team ke anya saathiyon ne bhi gavaskar kii is pari par aashcharya vyakt kiya or jab match ke baad gavaskar dressing room main pahunche to unase kisi saathi khilaadi ne baat tak nahin kii
 Was Gavaskar really out of form? Despite this performance against England, Gavaskar was given a chance to play the next match
 yah match khelaa gaya england ke khilaaf match ke thik chaar din baad east africa se or isamen gavaskar ne 86 gendon main 65 ran or phir iske baad antim lig match main newjiland ke khilaaf 14 gendon par 12 ran banaae
 When the team returned to India, the manager also reported the innings to the board but the board did not officially say anything to Gavaskar
 isi ke saath puraa maamla khatm ho gaya
 The issue of racist treatment of Indians in Australia should not be softly dealt with but strictly dealt with
 ye kahana he shivasena supremeo bala sahib thakare kaa
 Bal Thackeray has written an article on this in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana
 unhone amitabh bachchan kii taareef karte hue kaha he ki australia se milane vaale doctoret ke sammaan ko thukraa kar amitabh ne bahut acha kiya

 ram madhav ne kaha ki nehru sarkaar ne deport karne kaa masauda 1950 ke dashak main taiyaar kiya tha
 He said that in 1950 Nehru created the Immigration Expulsion From Assam Act, which was intended to drive illegal infiltrators out of Assam
 ram madhav ne kaha ki haalanki, gaiyrkanoonee dhang se desh main aae logon ko panaah dene kaa kaam koi bhi desh nahin karegaa

 Recently, the Meghalaya High Court found The Shillong Times editor Patricia Mukhim and publisher Shobha Chaudhary guilty of contempt and sentenced them to deposit Rs two lakh each
 meghalaya hai court ke chif justise mohammad yaqub or justise sudeep ranjan sen kii bench ne samvidhan ke anuchhed 215 ke tahat sazaa sunaate hue di shilong times kii sampadak or prakaashak ko court khatm hone tak baithne ko kaha
 Both have to deposit two lakh rupees within a week
 agar nahin de paae to chah maheene kii jail hogi
 The newspaper will be banned
 di shilong times ne 6 disambar 2018 ko ek khabar chhaapi jiskaa sheershak tha "when judges judge for themselves" yani jab jaj hi apane liye jaj ban jaaen
 It was in this news that Justice SR Sen has decided to provide a wide range of facilities for the retired Chief Justice, the judge, his wives and children
 medical kii suvidha, protocol kii suvidha, guest house, ghar par ardli, mobile internet kaa bill or phone ke liye 80,000 rupee isamen shaamil hai
 It was written in the news that Justice Sen was due to retire in March
 sandesh ye gaya ki ve ritair hone se pehle apane liye aisa chaahate hai
 Which was contempt in the eyes of the court as the newswriter added the intention
 ek march ko patrisia or shobhaa choudhary ne court main bina shart maafinama jamaa kar diya
 The court considered that to avoid punishment
 jab laga ki aaropon kaa bachaav nahin kar paa rahe hai to aakhri vakt main bina shart maafee maang lee
 We have taken this from the news of Nagaland Post
 supreme court kaa faisla he ki uske faislon kii aalochana ho sakati he
 It also happens
 samiksha ho sakati he
 But you cannot add motive
 kya yah itani badi chook thi ki itani sakht sazaa di jaae
 Warning to ban the newspaper for not paying a fine of two lakhs
 meghalaya hoicourt kaa ek purana aadesh he jise lekar vivaad ho chukaa tha
 Remind you that on 7 January 2016, the Chief Justice of the Meghalaya High Court ordered for the protection of z category and y category for the former judge
 rajya ke ek naagarik sajay lalu ne supreme court main ise chunauti di or donon ko saamaanya suraksha di gai
 The Supreme Court changed the decision to protect z and y categories
 akhbaar kii editor or prakaashak supreme court ja sakati hai magar sazaa kii sakhti ko lekar press sanghathanon ne chintaa jataai he
 The Editors Guild of India has said in its statement that the Editors Guild of India is quite disturbed by the order of the Meghalaya High Court in a contempt case against The Shillong Times
 aadesh main fine ke alaava na chukaane par jail or akhbaar kaa prakaashan band karne kii baat he
 This is a threatening order
 press kii swatantraaa ko kam karata he
 The irony is that the strict judiciary which has been the custodian of freedom of the press has come out of such strict order
 gild aagrah karata he ki nyaaypalika apane sanvaidhanik adhikaron kaa istemaal satarkta se kare or loktantr main press kii swatantraaa kaa bhi sammaan kare
 The Network of Women in Media, India, NWMI has also issued a statement and said that contempt should not be used like a sword on the media
 sanghathan ne kaha he ki meghalaya hai court kaa faisla kaaphi sakht he
 The editor and publisher of the newspaper have apologized, the court should consider its sentiment
 sweekaar karnaa chahie
 The Meghalaya High Court should show leniency
 pro apurvanand ne bhi meghalaya ke akhbaar di shilong times kii sampadak petrisia mukhim or prakaashak ke khilaaf aae faisle par chintaa jataai he
 Apoorvananda says that both contempt and defamation are being used to suppress the freedom of media
 apurvanand ne kaha ki 'petrisia kaa kaam hi ek jarnlist ke rup main prayek sanstha par nigaah rakhana or yadi lage wo galat kar rahi he to uski aalochana karnaa he
 He had followed his religion and criticized the High Court order in which it said
 ho saktaa he ki petrisia ke akhbaar se main asahmat hum lekin iskaa ye matlab nahin ki unako apane mat vyakt karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 More objection is that the court said that Patricia wants to control the court
 jab main koi aalochana karata hum to main kisi ko control nahin karata hum
 i just want to tell you what i think about him
 'vaise jajon ko acchhee se acchhee suvidhaayen milani chahie
 Phone is good and internet is also good
 unke kaam kii zaruuratein hi aisi hai
 After retirement their facilities should also be taken care of so that there is no loss in their honor
 yah zaruri he taaki unke ritairement ke baad bhi koi unke swabhimaan ko thes na pahunchaa sake
 By the way, if the issue of pension comes in public on the pretext of this news, then what is the matter
 lakhon kii sankhya main sarkari karmchaaree chaahate hai ki pension kii puraani vyavastha behaal ho
 He has fought many times over this issue
 magar raajnneetik nishtha ke kaaran unka naitik bal or aatm bal kamazor pad gaya he
 So much that he says with a loud voice that the issue of pension should not be raised
 sawaal mere uthaane kaa nahin hai
 The question is how honest are you about your issue
 puraani pension kaa mudda dhire-dhire karmchaariyon ke bich banataa ja rahaa he
 Now-a-days, political parties will have to confront this question or if the employees are honest, they will have to confront the political parties about their issue because no one else talks in support of this issue
 sarkari karmchaariyon ke sanghathan ko abhi naitik bal hasil karnaa hoga
 Otherwise the agitations for pensions did not get any less
 lekin mantriyon or vipaksh ke netaaon ne unke mudde ko jawaab dene laayak bhi nahin samajhavats ap se aane vaale massej bataa rahe hai ki naujavaanon kii pareshaani kya he

 In which the hearing has been held and the matter is deferred till the next hearing
 parikshaarthi suchi banaakar bhej rahe hai ki kis taarikh ko sunwaayee hui, kis taarikh ko sunwaayee tal gai
 When the CBI has submitted the report, they are waiting for a quick decision
 inkaa kahana he ki media inke masale par dhyaan nahin detaa he
 They should ask themselves a question and tell me what they like to see on the media
 kya ve hindu-muslim dibet or farji rashtrawaad kii bahason ko chhodkar aam logon se sambandhit boring maani jaani vaali khabaron ko dekhte hai
 He has received media attention when his life is at stake
 in naujavaanon ko khud se poochna hoga, unhen samajhnaa hoga ki hindu-muslim masalon india-pakistan ke nakli muddon ko aage kar media ne janata ko hi peeche kar diya he
 When the frenzy of war is spread on the channels, what do they think about the media
 mujhe whatsap karne vaale noujvaan bataaen ki kya ve anya channelon ke prime time main aisi khabaren dekhte hai, dekhnaa pasand karenge
 However, their problem is serious

 If examinations have to go through a long process, then the future of these youth will be at stake

 These candidates have written in their message that the court does not care about them
 rafel or ram mandir ke mudde par sunwaayee ho jaati he unki zindagi ke masale par nahin
 We understand the restlessness of the youth but they should know and try to know that the Supreme Court has its own system of hearing the cases
 18 tareekhen mili hai is cese ko, iskaa matlab he ki system kaam kar rahaa he
 i am telling you what is the procedure in court
 sabase pehle supreme court main yachika daakhil hoti he
 This is checked by the registrar
 koi kami hoti he to vakil se dur karne ko kaha jaataa he
 The registry of the case then lists the case in front of the bench according to the roster via computer
 kareeb 10 fisadi cese samvedansheel hote hai, jinhen register jeudicial chif justise aaf india ke paas lekar jate hai
 Being the Master of Roster, the Chief Justice lists sensitive cases before the Bench
 baaki 90 fisadi cese computerise tareeke se list hote hai
 There is a limit of listing 60 cases in front of a bench in a day
 aam taur par ek din main ek bench ke paas ausatan 120 cese hote hai
 There are only 60 case lists on a priority basis
 ek baar cese kii sunwaayee ho gai yaa agali sunwaayee ab vahi bench tay karti he
 Many times no case is available for hearing
 aisa pakshon dwaara zaruri kaagazat na jamaa karaane ke kaaran bhi hota he
 In such a situation, the party ments before the bench for early hearing of the case
 nae chif justise ne ek nai prakriya shuru kii he
 Under this, new petitions will be listed within a week
 supreme court main ek saal main 60,000 yachikaayen daakhil hoti hanummid he esayssi sijiel 2017 ke parikshaarthiyon ko supreme court kii prakriya ke bare main pataa chalaa hoga
 It is important that their case should be decided quickly, but the process of the court should be known so that there is no doubt about anything unnecessary
 or aap mujhase yah na kahen ki prime time main dikhaa duun to court taarikh tay kar degi
 Therefore, you were given such information so that you do not get into the illusion that showing in prime time gives a date in the court

 maharashtra main loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bijepi or shivasena ne ek baar phir haath milakar gathbandhan (BJP- Shivsena alliance) ko barkaraar rakhaa, jabaki is gathbandhan ke bhavishya ko lekar lambey arse se sanshay kii sthiti thi
 With this alliance, new equations are being speculated in the politics of Maharashtra
 charchaa he ki shivasena (shivsena) ke 'rajkumaar' aditya thakare (aaditya Thackeray) ab chunaav maidan main najar aa sakate hai or nikat bhavishya main maharashtra ke mukhyamantri ke rup main bhi najar sakate hai
 After the announcement of bjp-shiv Sena alliance on Monday, there is talk of sudden reversal of Shiv Sena everywhere
 saath main ek or charchaa chal rahi he ki kya shivasena mukhyamantri ke taur par aditya thakare ko dekhnaa chaahati he?bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan kii ghoshnaa ke maukey par manch par shivasena ke yuva netaa aditya thakare kii maujuudagi ke kya myne hai? kya aditya ko shivasena kii taraf se agle mukhyamantri ke taur prachaarit karne kii taiyaari he? charchaa yah bhi he ki aditya thakare mahim se vidhansabha chunaav bhi ladane vaale hai
 The Shiv Sena is silent on this matter, but the opponents are still considering it better to avoid answering this question by laughing
 haalanki thakare parivaar ke kisi sadsy ne abhi tak koi chunaav nahin ladaa he or sarkaar main bhi shaamil nahin hua he
 Like Bal Thackeray, Uddhav Thackeray has done the work of keeping the remote control in his hand while staying out of the government

 He explains this aspect in some detail in his own style, "the place of satirical composition has increased and decreased
 ab dekhie ki pehle kavita likhane vaale gali-gali the
 There are still villages
 darasal hua yah he ki ab kavi bhi vyangy likhane lage
 Earlier the satire space was less
 sharad (joshi) ji roj likhte the, (harishankar) parasaai ji likhte the
 Gradually, the satire tried to make an immodate according to the need and demand
 vyangy taatkaalik caments main simit hota gaya
 The editor is no longer seeking composition skills, he needs contention, immediate
 kharaab rachana bhi chal jaaegi
 The quality of creation is printed
 ''peshey se hriday rog visheshgy chaturvedi hindi sahitya kii duniya main shrilaal shukla, sharad joshi, harishankar parasaai, rabindra nath tyaagi or manohar shyaam joshi kii vichaar-chintan parampara ke vyangyakaar hai
 This aspect is significant in that even under the pressures of shortening and shortening, they have been writing in their own style
 unki lagaataar badhati lokapriyata kaa hi takaza he ki unke vyangy upanyaason baramasi, narkayatra or marichika ke kai-kai sanskaran aa chuke hai
 There have been more than ten versions of Hell Yatra
 laud hone se parhez karne vaale chaturvedi apane bebaaki ke liye jane jate hai
 That is why he says, "I have read Arundhati Roy's writing as well and i think i have not written even if not higher than them
 angreji main likh rahaa hota to mujhe bhi ek karod ru
 See advance hindi main likhnaa nangon ke shahar main londry kii dukaan kholane jaisaa he
 "throwing a little more light on the economics of Hindi writing," he says that sometimes a few awards may cost Rs
 kaa check aapako mil jaae varanaa roylty kii to puuchhie hi mat
 In pure fantasy and in a completely different way from the genre of satirical novels, he has written for two years
 yahaan tak ki chah-chah draft tak sampadit karte rahe hai
 For the last six months, he has spent 6-7 hours daily on it
 bazaarwaad kaa badhata dakhal unhen lagaataar pareshaan kar rahaa tha
 In his words, "I was writing on it in my articles, but i used to think again and again that i have not been able to say the whole thing
" mere man main ek katha ai ki meraa desh agar bazaarwaad kii tarah hi sochane lage to kya drishy banegaa
 Folk art, music are all going on, which the market is promoting
 vichaar, vyavhaar, samskruti, sahitya sab bazaar govern kar rahaa he
 Everyone needs a market, but marketism is wrong
 ye chijen mujhe daraati thim
 i have taken it like a huge madhouse
 ''bahes main ek pahalu yah bhi ubharkar aata he ki ab kya likhaa jaae or kya nahin, iske bhi chunaav kii puri aazaadee vyangyakaar ko nahin rah gai he
 Sushil Siddharth, the author of the satirical collections of Narada's Anxiety, Massage Mahapuran and Marginali sangaron, sees this as associated with the decreasing tolerance of society
 unheen ke shabdon main, ''sahansheeltaa kaa alam yah he ki aaj naam lekar rajanetaaon par likhnaa mushkil ho gaya he
 The same situation is also for the social and religious sector
 naam lekar likh dijie to sampadak chhapane se hi manaa kar degaa
 That is to write something that the gardeners should also be happy, the Sayyid also agreed
 '' puranic isamen ek doosraa pahalu jodate hai
 He says that while writing on marketism earlier, we used to get angry with the names of Coca Cola and Pepsi Cola, nobody objected
 ab sampadak pehle hi kah dete hai ki falaan-falaan brands par mat likhnaa kyonki vahi khel ke bhi praayojak hai or vigyapandaata bhi
 The question arises that even Joshi, Parsai and Shukla wrote for newspapers, but they never compromised in their narrative
 balki unki style or bebaak bani, saath-saath unki lokapriyata bhi badi
 Parsai hardly spared any of the big leaders of politics, religion, society, from Pandit Nehru
 darasal, vyangy lekhan kii ek badi shart he saahas
 The reason for these writers to become leaders in this genre was that they did not panic even by any person, power or system
 vaise, chaturvedi is pahalu se utana ittefaq nahin rakhte
 They remember the attack on Parsai once, but they take him as an exception
 ve maanate hai ki paabandiyaan pehle bhi lagati thim, ab thodaa zyada lag rahi hai
 But if an idea has come to his mind and he is Genuin then he will keep saying because there is no end to fear
 ve bataate hai, ''madhya pradesh sarkaar ne 2015 main padmashri sammaan ke liye meraa naam bheja hua tha
 Then i wrote a satire that the dictator can now fall into the ranks of a popular leader and messiah of the poor
 jahaan yah chapa, vahaan ke sampadak ne iske saath narendra modi kaa cheharaa bhi chaspaan kar diya
 An acquaintance of mine in Bhopal said that if you write in this way then forget Padmashri
 lekin mujhe award mila
 Now the skin of the people has become really thick
 main vaise bhi kabhi kisi par nijee hamalaa nahin karata
 Talk on a trend
 or us par mujhe nahin lagata ki koi khatra he
 "siddhartha also agrees that if the satirist does not have courage, then he will be clearly seen in his writing
" ''aapmen agar hichak he to shabd aapkaa saath chhod denge
 There, Kabir shows you the way to stop fearing on this earth
 '' There is also a style of satire in the realm of debate
 kisi lekhak kii rachana apane saath ek shilp bhi lekar aati he
 But there emerged many writers here, which looks like a house in a single colony
 chaturvedi kehete hai ki ''sampadak ke naam patr likhane vaale vyangy likhane lage or ve apane hi banaae bhram main jeene lage
 Satire is being written without understanding the text of satire
 '' siddharth, jinka vyangy upanyaas tamashbin or vyangy naatak antaheen jald hi aane vaale hai, ko lagata he ki vyangy main se vichaar gaayab ho rahe hai
 "when you analyze events, ideas come
" vah aap kar nahin rahe kyonki vishleshan ke liye aapako bahut padhuya or objrv karnaa padataa he
 In the morning thought that i should write
 thitholi, kataaksh kar liya
 Reporting in sarcasm
 '' janamejay ko lagata he ki ''yah lalu yadav tip samay nahin he
 Now to understand Amit Shah's Shatranji move, a big brain is needed
 ''chaturvedi kii bebaak raay he ki vyangy ultimetali content main he or vah khatm hota ja rahaa he
 Parsai and Joshi used to write something so deep in one-and-a-half feet that he used to comment on his whole life
 puranic ek buniyadi pahalu kii ore ishaara karte hue jaise sam par aate hai, ''aapako agar kaayade kaa vyangy likhnaa he to karl mannrs, osho or lohia ko padhuya padegaa
 Only then you will be able to know your country and society properly and then write
 '' yani ki gaagar main sagar bhar sakenge

 But even the big pundits of cinema are not able to give a solid opinion about "what to see, what to see" about the Indian International Film Festival (IFFI), which came from Goa's identity seven years ago
 iffphi hi nahin, desh-duniya ke tamaam filmotsavon main 'acchhee' filmon par ungali rakh paanaa aasaan nahin hota

 Notably, Rituparno Ghosh — whose two Bengali films Abohoman and Nauka Dubey were shown at the film festival — takes the cinema to a new artistic height

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is adamant about discussing the anti-corruption Jan Lokpal bill at the city stadium
 unka kahana he ki lokapal bill ke liye vidhansabha kaa vishesh khulaa satr yojit kiye jaae or vidhayak vahiin us par charchaa karen
 Kejriwal said today, 'open session is an integral part of our democracy
 ' iske saath hi unhone kaha ki agar dilli police iske liye jaruri suraksha muhaiyaa nahin kara paati he, to police pramukh ko istipha de dena chahie
 Earlier, Delhi's Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung had asked Kejriwal to reconsider his decision citing 'sanctity of law and order and assembly proceedings' to which Kejriwal has sent him this aggressive reply
 arvind kejariwal kaa kahana he ki dilli ke uparajyapal janalokapal bill ke mudde par duvidha main he
 Actually, Kejriwal also went to meet the Lieutenant Governor
 uparajyapal ke saath unki janalokapal ke mudde par baat hui
 According to Kejriwal, the Lieutenant Governor has said that he will take a decision only after the opinion of the Law Ministry
 kejariwal ne kaha ki uparajyapal duvidha main hai ki ek tarah samvidhan he or duusari taraf grih mantralay
 According to sources, Lt
 Governor Najeeb Jung, in a meeting with Kejriwal, has urged him not to hold a debate in the stadium on the Jan Lokpal bill
 gauratlab he ki ravivaar ko hi enditivi se baatcheet karte hue mukhyamantri kejariwal ne kaha tha ki yadi dilli vidhansabha main janalokapal bill paas nahin hua, tab vah apana istipha de denge
 At the same time, Chief Minister Kejriwal's meeting with the Lieutenant Governor assumes significance after the announcement of withdrawal of support by Vinod Kumar Binny, a party MLA and now an Independent MLA, Rambir Shokin
 vahiin, kejariwal ke istife kii dhamkee ke baad congress ne kaha ki janalokapal bill par bahes main koi aapatti nahin he, lekin saare kaam samvidhan ke tahat hone chahie
 The BJP on the other hand said that it is with the Kejriwal government in the fight against corruption

 There is a difference of ground in the demands of the civil society worker and the government's readiness to obey them: - Social workers want the Prime Minister to be brought under the purview of Lokpal Bill, the Government says that doing so will make it difficult for the Prime Minister to function Will be done

 jaayra wasim ne likhaa tha, "5 saal pehle maine ek aisa faisla liya, jisane meri jindagi ko hameshaa ke liye badal diya
 As soon as i stepped into Bollywood, many avenues of popularity opened up for me
 mujhe logon kii atension milane lagi
 At times, i was also considered a role model of youth
 haalanki ye sab wo nahin tha, jisaki maine khwaahish kii thi
 Especially with regard to success and spread
 "actress ne likhaa tha, "aaj mujhe bollywood main 5 saal pur ho gaye hai
 i want to say that i am not happy with this identity and the work i am doing
 lambey samay se mujhe aisa lag rahaa he ki main kuch duusari insaan banane kii jaddojahad main lagi hui hum
 i have realized that the things that i am giving time, the things i am working hard for, and the new lifestyle i am trying to adopt, i can fit in all the things, but i i am not made for these things

 comhara ore jab bhrashtachar or swaarth kaa shor sunai de rahaa ho or har duusari khabar kisi kaale karname se judi ho
 In such an environment, getting this book in hand is really nothing short of a pleasant feeling
 ise padhgaye ke baad kaha ja saktaa he ki ummid abhi baaki he
 This book by Rashmi Bansal, who wrote bestseller books like Stay Hungry Stay Fullish and Correct the Dot, gives 20 people a chance to raise expectations
 ye ve log hai jinhone sava sau karod anya bharatiyon ke vipareet apane confort jone se aage badhkar kuch karne kii thaanee he
 These are 20 such social entrepreneurs who are among us but they are not going to fulfill their duty by grieving over someone's distress
 unhone jo sochaa usee raah par bade or phir palatakar nahin dekha
 Then no matter how many troubles come in the way
 hameshaa se kaha jaataa rahaa he ki kranti sabase pehle khud se hi shuru hoti he
 Rashmi Bansal has also said that some such dreams came true
 is kitaab ko padhate hue nepolian kii baat dimag main daud jaati he, ‘‘agar aap chaahate hai ki koi cheez utkrisht tareeke se ho to aap use khud kiijie
 "all the stories seem to reflect the same thing
" rashmi ne kitaab ko interesting banane ke liye ise teen hisson main baanta he: meghdoot, parivartankarta or divine puunjipati
 Meghdoot starts with Bindeshwar Pathak of Sulabh International, the father of toilet toilet revolution
 ek brahman jisane bharat main mailaa dhone waalon ko unke kaaryon se mukti dilaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 "we feel that the benefits of globalization reach the poor," says Bindeshwar in the book
 yah kaam dimag se nahin, keval dil se ho saktaa he
 "it was only by listening to this heart that he created a revolution through Sulabh International
 parivartankarta main super-30 ke anand kumaar ek aisa naam hai, jinhone hajaaron garib bacchon kaa jivan badal kar rakh diya he
 They are engaged in the search and carving of nagis from the dark streets of India
 unka cambridge main padhgaye kaa khwab to sach nahin ho sakaa tha lekin ve duusare chaatro kaa jivan badal rahe hai
 In the book, he says, "I would take the stories of students from Bhagalpur, Nalanda and Gaya on mobile phones
" ’’ chaatro ko phayda pahunchane ke unke jazbe kaa khulaasa is baat se bakhubi jaahir ho jaataa he
 Another name in this section is that of Arvind Kejriwal
 jinhone in dinon aam aadmi ke haq main apni aawaaj buland kar rakhi he or aae din nae khulaason se bhrashton kaa jivan halkaan kiye hue hai
 His dream is of such a true democracy where an ordinary man has the right to live as he pleases
 desh main soochna kaa adhikaar lagu hone kaa shrey bhi isi purv iares adhikari ko jaataa he
 He advises young entrepreneurs, "just as we take responsibility for the well-being of our families, we should also take responsibility for the well-being of the country
"

 True Sapne is a Hindi translation of Rashmi Bansal's English book i Have a Dream
 hameshaa kii tarah rashmi ne ekadam simple bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya he
 In the translation also, an attempt has been made to follow this tradition of English to a large extent
 haalanki kuch shabd aise hai, jo kahin atakaey hai or aam pathak ke lihaaj se thode mushkil ho jate hai
 Entrepreneur and writer Rashmi's first two books Stay Hungry Stay Fullish and Correct the Dot have sold over five lakh copies and have been translated into more than ten Indian languages
 iiem-ahmedabad se emb rashmi ke lekhan main mukhya swar yuvaaon ko prerit karne kaa rahata he
 Therefore, he is also considered a specialist of youth oriented subjects

 Says Rashmi, "these changing people think like entrepreneurs
 ye log main ke mayajaal se nikalakar ham kii avadharana par amal karne vaale hai
 "these are people who are trying to make the world a better place to live using management principles and modern technology
" vasudaiv kutunbakam or kamajoro ko shashakt banane kii avadharana se las yah kitaab yuvaaon ke liye preranarot kaa kaam to kar hi sakati he, iske alaava hamaare samay ke saamaajik krantikariyon kii hakeekat ko bhi bakhubi hamaare saamne pesh karne kaa kaam karti he

 dilli se sategaziabadke sihani get ilaake kii nand gram krishna vihaar socity main ghar ke andar ghuskar ek yuvak kidhardaar hathiyaarase galaa ret karahatyakar di gai
 It is being told that the deceased woke up in the morning and went to the toilet but after some time came and slept again
 uski maa ghar main safai kaa kaary kar rahi thi
 But after some time, when his mother visited the room, his son was lying dead in the room in a bloody condition
 gharavaalon ne aanan-fanan main sthaneey logon ke alaava police ko suchit kiya
 On the basis of information, the police reached the spot and took the body of the deceased and sent it for postmortem and started investigating the case
 sihani get ilaake kii nand gram colony main krishna vihaar naam se ek socity he, jahaan par yah parivaar rahata he
 Bharat (30), the deceased, used to sell electrical goods to salesmen

 Then her mother was doing cleaning work in the house
 lekin bharat ke kaaphi der tak kamare se baahar naa aane ke kaaran uski maa ko shaq hua or kamare main jaakar dekha to vah lahooluhaan haalat main mrit avasthaa main padaa hua tha
 In this entire case, Ghaziabad SSP Vaibhav Krishna told that the police is investigating the case from several angles
 unhone kaha ki jald hi is puure cese kaa khulaasa karte hue aropiyon ko giraftaar kiya jayega
 It is clear that a big question has arisen in the whole incident that when India got up in the morning and went to the toilet and her mother was working inside the house, then who came and slit her throat? Whose mother could not even find her mother present in the house

 inamen se ek ranvir singh bhi the, jinhen aayojakon ne moti rakam ofer kii thi
 It is now reported that he will not be a part of the ceremony due to his injury
 unki jagah kisi or bade abhinayta ke naam kii charchaa chal rahi he
 According to the news, Hrithik Roshan, one of the finest dancers, can now be a part of this program in place of Ranveer
 bataa den ki ek footbal match ke dauraan ranvir singh ghayal ho gaye the
 After this, the doctor advised him not to do any hard work for 1 month
 footbal match ke dauraan ranvir ghayal, IPL main nahin karenge parform!khabaren ye bhi hai ki ranvir film 'gali boy' kii shooting karte rahenge, lekin overstress se bachane ke liye wo IPL ke opening de samaaroh kaa hissaa nahin honge
 In his place the organizer is talking to Hrithik Roshan about this
 haalanki abhi is baat kii pushti nahin hui he ki rithik kii is ofer ko sweekaara he yaa nahin
 Let us tell you that Hrithik performed in the opening day of the IPL tournament held in Kolkata in the year 2015
 IPL kii opening main is actor ko milenge ranvir singh se zyada paise!varun dhawan bhi is kaarykram kaa hissaa honge or iske liye unhen lagbhag 6 karod rupye die jane kii khabar he
 Bollywood's glamorous actresses Jacqueline Fernandes and Parineeti Chopra are also ready to put on the moon this time
 chunaav se pehle yuvaaon main josh bharne ke liye dilli pradesh congress ne pasinaa bahaanaa shuru kar diya he
 In a meeting held at the party's state headquarters, Union Minister Oscar Fernandes gave the victory mantra to the workers and leaders of NSUI
 is paathshaala main rahul gandhi ke naam par yuvaaon ko ekajute karne kaa aahvaan kiya gaya
 All four seats are currently occupied by NSUI in Delhi University
 aise main party ke saamne jahaan dusu chunaav main phir se sabhi siten jeetne kii chunauti he to uske baad vidhansabha chunaav ke liye maahaul taiyaar karnaa bhi ahm jimmedaari he
 On this occasion, Fernandes said that party workers and NSUI should start the victory with the DUSU elections
 congress ke netaa is baat ko jaanate hai ki in chunaavon main jeet hasil karnaa aasaan nahin he
 The outcome of the DUSU election works to find the pulse of the youth in the country
 jis tarah yuva peedi main narendra modi kii lokapriyata badi he use dekhte hue congress apni ore se koi kasar nahin chhodana chaahati
 In 37 of the 49 bodies, Congress won the election of the chairman with equal number of votes, the lottery was decided after the formation of the government in Maharashtra, the results of the civic elections in Rajasthan were disappointing for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) who lost power
 nikaay chunaav main congress ne jeet kaa paracham laharaaya
 The ruling party of the state was successful in making its chairmen or mayors in 37 of the 49 bodies
 teen nikaayon main donon dalon ko baraabar vot mili, jiske baad faisla lottery se karnaa padaa
 Of the three seats decided by lottery, two seats were formed by the Congress board in Nasirabad and Udaipur
 vahiin ek seat chhabda bhaajapa ke paale main gai
 There was also a big relief for Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot
 tonk main bhi congress kaa board ban gaya, jahaan par congress ke maatr 24 parshad jite the jabaki 36 parshadon ne congress ke liye vot kiya
 In Pushkar, BJP was able to form its own board with one vote, while in Pratappura, Banswara, BJP won for the first time with one vote
 kai nikaayon main congress ko ekatarfa safaltajhunjhunu ,alvar, sikar, nagaur or chittorgarh main congress ko ekatarfa safalataa mili
 In all these places, the Congress was successful in making its chairman
 nagar nigam ke teen jagah chunaav hue the or teenon main bhaajapa ko acchhee badhat mili thi lekin bharatpur main nirdaleeyon or or duusari jagah se parshadon ko todakar congress apana meyar banane main safal rahi
 The Lok Sabha elections were lost, Abhijeet Jatav, who was contesting as an MP in the Jatwalk Lok Sabha elections, lost the election on a Congress ticket, but he won the election of mayor in Bharatpur
 isi tarah se bikaner main pehali baar bhaajapa kii mahila meyar bani hai to udaipur main bhi bhaajapa ne meyar kaa pad hasil kiya he
 Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot's stature has increased with the election of local bodies
 shahari ilaakon main mana jaataa he ki bhaajapa ke voter zyada hai, iske baavjood congress ne acchhee safalataa pai he
 During the BJP elections, the Supreme Court's decision on the issue of Article 370 and Ram temple in Ayodhya was also widely publicized, but it also did not work
 bollywood bhartiya raajnneeti kii tarah bhai-bhatijawad kii sabase badi misaal he
 Where Kapoor, Chopra, Roshan and Khan are in possession, and making a place for Outsiders in the film industry is not an easy task
 lekin agar koi star kid he to maukon kii bharmaar he
 The flop does not matter much and the career goes on with a hitch
 pichley haftinil kapoorke sahibajaade or sonam kapur ke bhai harshavardhan kapur ne box offis par dastak di
 The film Aundhe Mouth fell at the box office
 kapur san or filmi family se taalluk rakhane vaali sayaami kher kii jodi main koi karant nahin tha or yah jodi darshakon ko cinemaghar tak laane main buree tarah naakaam rahi
 Harshvardhan Kapoor should be careful about this because these signs are not good for him
 star pita hone kii vajah se darshak bete main bhi vahi hunar dhundte hai or vaisaa hi maahirapan bhi
 If the son turns out to be nineteen from the father, then his fate is bad
 jaisaa jitendra ke suputr tushaar kapur ke saath hua
 He was nowhere near Jumping Jack's father and is only pursuing his career with his sister's films
 lekin star kids ke liye sabase khatarnaak hota he active pita or vah bhi agar wo main role main ho to
 As in the case of Abhishek Bachchan
 jab abhishek ne 2000 main rifuji se kariyar shuru kiya us samay unke pita amitabh bachchan 'muhabbatein' or 'ankhen' jaisi filmein kar rahe thea
 He was in full swing in the film industry and films were being written about him
 unka andaaj sab ke dilo dimag par haaavee tha
 In such a situation, Abhishek's entry and despite millions of efforts, he could not manage to win the hearts of the audience the way his father had scattered
 vah lakh koshishon ke baavjood asafal rahe or aajkal filmon (multistarar adhiktar) ke saath kabddi lig bhi chalaa rahe hai
 Harshvardhan Kapoor has to take this very carefully because his father Anil Kapoor is active in films
 in dinon tivi par vah 24 ke saath apana jhakaas style dikhaa rahe hai
 It is special that this is season-2 of 24
 yani safalataa unke kadam ab bhi chuum rahi he or vah bhi chote-bade parade donon par hi
 He has done films like 'mission Impossible' in Hollywood and everyone remembers 'slumdog Millionaire'
 unki res frenchiji darshakon main kaaphi lokapriy hai
 Anil Kapoor is 59 years old and due to his looks and coolness, no one can guess his age
 phir jis tarah kii energy vah lekar aate hai vah kamaal he
 His comedy film Welcome Back has also been a hit
 harshavardhan ko pita kii jhalak ko kahin bhi khud par haaavee nahin hone dena hoga
 He neither needs to dance like Anil Kapoor, nor to laugh nor to walk nor to speak Jhakaas
 'mirzia'ek haadasa ho sakati he
 But Harshvardhan should not make any such effort anywhere that starts comparison
 unhen apni star kid hone ko bhuulakar film kii kahani or apane tallent par bharosa karnaa hoga kyonki ek superstar san hone kii vajah se unhen filmein to mil sakati hai, lekin kamyaabi unhen apane hi dam par milegi

 "what is this policy that has become only a loss policy?" He asked, according to the media report Priyanka Gandhi cited, the sell-off in the stock market is affecting many companies as well
 In two and a half months, LIC has lost about Rs 57,000 crore from investing in the stock market

 On the other hand, citing a report of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued by the Congress, on Wednesday alleged that the Narendra Modi government is engaged in sacrificing the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) by investing money in risky public sector units
 
 party ke varisht pravaktaa ajay maakan ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, '2014 tak saarvajanik kshetra kii jokhim bhari ikaayiyon main elisi kaa nivesh 11

 "he claimed," Between 1956 and 2014, LIC invested twice the investment in risky units within five years of the Modi government

 He also said that the RBI report says that the debt on families in the country has doubled, which is not appropriate for the country's economy

 The BJP said on the attack of Sonia Gandhi that it does not need to take a certificate of responsibility from the Congress, it is expected to conduct accountability from it
 bhaajapa netaa ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki sarkaar sansad ke bheetar keval charchaa kii baat karti he, lekin javabdehi kii nahin
 At the same time, BJP leader Sushma Swaraj clearly said that if the government accepts the three conditions of the party, then it will step back in Parliament
 pehali shart he ki piem apana istipha denge
 Apart from this, all 142 allocations should be canceled and the third condition should be ordered inquiry in all these cases
 tippaniyan On the other hand, on the CAG report, the BJP has now decided to take the Parliament battle on the road
 party ne aalaa netaaon kii baithak main faisla kiya he ki party sarkaar ke khilaaf sadakon par morcha kholegi or logon ko sarkaar ke ghotaalon ke khilaaf jaagruk karegi
 Significantly, on the issue of coal block allocation, the Bharatiya Janata Party has directly attacked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and is adamant on the demand for pm's resignation
 vahiin, bhaajapa kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne saaf kaha ki sarkaar party kii teen sharton ko sweekaar kar legi tab vah sansad main apane kadam peeche khinch legi
 The first condition is that PM will resign
 iske alaava sabhi 142 aavanton radd kiye jaaen or teesri shart in sabhi maamalon main jaanch kaa aadesh diya jaae
 The comments udhar, kaig report par bijepi ne ab sansad kii ladaai ko sadak par le jane kaa faisla kar liya he
 The party has decided in a meeting of top leaders that the party will open a road front against the government and make people aware against the scams of the government
 gauratlab he ki kol block aavanton ke mudde par bhartiya janata party ne pradhanmantri manmohan singh par sidhaa hamalaa bolaa he or piem ke istife kii maang par adi hui he

 ve kisi bhi function main shirkat karti hai to aradhya ko liye bina nahin jaati
 Aaradhya is no less than her mother in terms of fashion
 akaash ambani kii shaadi main bhi donon kii khubsuurati dekhte hi ban rahi he
 While Aishwarya was seen in a purple colored embroidered lehenga on one side, Aaradhya was seen in a pink colored lehenga
 is royal shaadi main bollywood ke sabhi bade sitaron ne shirkat kii
 At the wedding Katrina Kaif, Ranbir Kapoor, Ranveer Singh, Aamir Khan, Disha Patni, Jackie Shroff, Tiger Shroff, Kiara Advani, Kiran Rao, Deepika Padukone, Priyanka Chopra, Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Anupama Chopra, Rajkumar Hirani, Kareena Kapoor, Karisma Kapoor , Many stars like Raveena Tandon arrived
 yah ek sanyog hi ho saktaa he ki piples democratic party (pidipi) ke bheetar kii kalah us samay sataha par ai he, jab bhaajapa ne jammu-kashmir kii mahabuuba mufti kii sarkaar ke saath saadhe teen saal purana apana gathbandhan tod liya he
 However, it was already predicted that everything is not well within the PDP
 ab party ke chah vidhayakon ne mahabuuba mufti ke khilaaf baghawat kaa paracham khulkar laharaa diya he
 But contrary to the expectations of most people, BJP does not seem to be behind this discontent in PDP
 darasal yah to mahabuuba ke sarkaar ke saath-saath party main bhi lagaataar apane parivaar ke vafaadaaron ko badhaava dene ke prayaason kaa anjaam he
 Insiders say serious differences arose earlier, when Mehbooba made her younger brother and professionally appointed cinematographer Tasadduk Mufti as tourism minister in his cabinet
 unke is kadam se aise kuch vidhayakon main rosh paidaa hua tha jo mantripad kii khwaahish rakhte the
 Former minister and staunch Shia leader Imran Raza Ansari objected at that time and refused to attend Tasaduk's swearing-in ceremony
 aaj ve baagiyon kii aguai kar rahe hai
 He says that the whole problem actually started after the untimely death of Mufti Mohammad Sayeed in January 2016
 ansaari ke mutabik mahabuuba ne apane rishtedaaron or parivaar ke vafaadaaron ko har jagah baitaakar sabko saath lekar chalane kii apane pita kii soch se kanni kaat lee he
 Those who lost elections like Mehbooba's maternal uncle Sartaj Madni and Pirzada Mansoor Hussain were appointed as the President and General Secretary of the PDP respectively
 yah baat mahabuuba tak aakar hi khatm nahin hui
 Both Madani and Hussain also began to pursue their relatives
 asal main madani ke bete saiyad aruth ko jod-tod se rajya khaadi gramodyog board kaa kaaryakari adhikari chunaa gaya tha, jiske baad rajya main ek bada rajnatik bakheda shuru ho gaya tha
 Ansari says, "sartaj (madni) runs everything
" agar unke saath aapke rishte madhur na hon, to phir chaaron ore aapke liye mushkilen khadi milengi
 Pirzada Mohammad Hussain, a close aide of Mufti Saeed in South Kashmir, blamed the 'quartet of political conspiracies' in 2017 for disrespecting himself from the Jammu and Kashmir Waqf Board
 ve kehete hai, ''mujhe sach bolne kii sajaa di gai
 Today all people are saying the same things
 mufti said kii maut ke baad hi mujhe foot kaa andeshaa ho gaya tha
 Jadibal MLA Abid Ansari first raised the voice of rebellion
 ve bataate hai ki dukhi vidhayakon ke ek samooh ne pichley maheene sarkaar girane se pehle srinagar main mahabuuba se unke ghar par mulaakaat bhi kii thi
 Abid says that Mehbooba had made it clear, she would not tolerate any complaint against her family members
 kashmir ke varisht bhaajapa netaaon kaa daawa he ki pidipi ke 28 main se 21 vidhayak party todakar bhaajapa ke saath sarkaar banane ko taiyaar the
 These six rebel mlas were also among them
 purv up-mukhyamantri kavinder gupta ne khule taur par kaha ki ''nae gathbandhan ke liye ummid kii kirane abhi baaki hai kyonki vidhansabha abhi bhang nahin kii gai he
 "he even claimed that" some legislators of the National Conference and Congress may also join this possible new formation
 '' sutron ne bataaya ki bhaajapa ne purv mantriyon haseeb drabu or abdul haq khan ko pidipi vidhayakon ko apane paale main laane ke kaam main lagaaya he
 Apparently, Mehbooba is furious with the dent in the party and he warned the BJP in Delhi, "if the move to break our party from Delhi goes and break the party, Sajjad Lone or someone else is made the Chief Minister
 Kashmiris will lose faith in Indian democracy
 '' unki baat par ansaari hansate hue poochhate hai, ''is masale par dilli kaa hamase kya lenaa-dena he?ve ghadithali aansu baha rahi hai
 The people of Kashmir have chosen us, not Delhi
 hamaari baghawat se dilli kaa kya vaasta?'' pidipi kii baghawat ke baad ab jammu-kashmir kii raajnneeti bhaajapa ke sahyogi or piples conference (pisi) ke adhyaksh sajaad gani lone ke ird-gird gumti dikh rahi he
 BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav, who arrived in Srinagar on 27 June, met Lone along with the BJP leaders
 isse in atakalon ko or hawa mil gai
 Interestingly, Madhav was also seen trying to rein in the rumors of the possibility of a new alliance in the state
 7 july ko ek twit main unhone jor dekar kaha ki bhaajapa 'rajya main shanti bahaali ke liye rajyapal shashan ko jari rakhane' ke paksh main he
 However, two days later, Madhav accepted the rebellion in the PDP: "rebellion notes are emerging in the PDP, but there is no talk of the BJP forming a coalition government with the rebel leaders of the PDP
" ''is bich, sutron ke mutabik pidipi ke 21 vidhayakon ke saath mahabuuba kii 8 july ko mulaakaat tay thi, lekin usamen keval 12 vidhayak hi pahunche
 Rebel mlas Imran and Abid Ansari stayed away from it, while another MLA Javed Baig said they would meet Mehbooba in the coming days
 kya aisi mushkil ghadi main ve mahabuuba kaa saath denge, is sawaal par kuch bhi kehane se ve bachate najar aae
 Analysts say that since the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani in July 2016, there has been a steady decline of mainstream political parties in the Valley - mainly the PDP, the National Conference, the Congress
 isliye sajaad lone ke ird-gird ek nai rajnatik dhuree ke ubharne ke bharpoor maukey ban sakate hai
 Nevertheless, since the Amarnath Yatra will continue till the month of August, the possibility of a major political stir in the state is unlikely until then
 uske baad bhi bahut kuch is par nirbhar karegaa ki ab rajyapal en

 *** purvottar ke logon ko dhara 371 ko lekar darane kii koi jarurat nahin he
 It is to say that Union Minister Dr
 jitendra singh kaa
 Under the Section 371, only the northeastern states have got the status of special states
 jitendra singh ne shuukravaar subah twit main kaha ki north east ko darane kii koi jarurat nahin he, dhara 371 jaisaa he, vaisaa hi rahegaa
 Earlier, Home Minister Amit Shah also said that there is a difference between 370 and 371
 vipaksh is par bhram failaa rahaa he
 Explain that Section 371 is applicable in 11 states of the country, which gives special power to the Central Government
 is dhara kii badaulat centre sarkaar us rajya main vikaas, suraksha, saranksha aadi se sambandhit kaam kar sakati he
 Article 371 (g) of the constitution states that Parliament cannot take decisions on matters of transfer of land ownership, religious and social practices of Mizos, without the consent of the Legislative Assembly
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 371(e) main kaha gaya he ki jameen ke malikana haq ko lekar naga samudaay ke paaramparik prathaon, shaskeey, naagarik or aapraadhik nyaay sambandhi niyamon ko sansad badal nahin sakati
 The central government can take a decision on this only if the state assembly does not bring any resolution or law
 ye kanoon tab banaaya gaya jab bharat sarkaar or naga logon ke bich 1960 main 16 binduon par samjhauta hua
 In a historic move, the central government removed Section 370 giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir and divided the state into two union territories

 dhaka main pichley hafte hue aatanki hamale ke baad charchaa main aae islamic prachaarak jakir nike ko lekar mumbai ke purv police kamishnar or bijepi saansad satyapal singh ne bada khulaasa kiya he
 Satyapal Singh has claimed that he sent a report to the Central Government in 2008 regarding the suspicious activities of Zakir Naik but no action was taken on him
 logon ko bargalane kaa aropaunhone bataaya kii jab ve kamishnar the unhonedow
 Zakir was also made aware of the government, but the government did not pay attention, due to which today this day has to be seen
 jakir nikdharm parivartan karaata he ore logon ko bargalaata he usko videshon se funding bhi hoti he
 BJP MP from Ghera Baghpat Satyapal Singh, while giving a press conference in Meerut on Saturday, raised the UP government in the dock on the law and order situation, while Dr
 Dr came to the controversy
 jakir nike kii funding kii jaanch karaane kii maang kii
 'I have gone to Naik's meetings' Dr
 jakir ke bare main satyapal singh ne bataaya kii wo ek dashak se unhen jaanate hai
 He himself has gone to their meetings and has seen the condition there
 unhone kaha kii fahrren funding ke jariye vahaan ho rahedharmaparivartanako dekhte hue unki foundation ko radd kiya janaa chahie
 'government did not take it seriously' When Zakir Naik was questioned by former Mumbai Police Commissioner and Baghpat MP Satyapal Singh, he said that during 2008 when he was the Mumbai Police Commissioner, he investigated it and gave a report to the state government and the then Sent to the Central Government
 or us par karrwai ke liye kaha tha lekin us vakt bharat sarkaar us par gambhir nahin hui
 Had it been serious, it would not have been seen today
 anusuchit jati-janajati (SC / ST) sanshodhan adhinium ke khilafasavarnasangathnon ke dwaara aaj 'bharat band' he
 On the streets, the upper castes are demanding the scrapping of the SC / ST Act, but no political party is openly supporting them
 jabaki desh main savarna samudaay ek badi raajnneetik takat rakhata he or satta banane se lekar bigaadane tak kaa hunar jaanata he
 35 organizations of the upper caste community including the Savarna Samaj, the Karni Sena, and the General, Backward and Minority Officers Employees Association (SPX) have come out on the road by announcing 'bharat Bandh' against the SC / ST Act
 is dauraan kai jagah aagjanee or todphod ke maamle saamne aa rahe hai
 The upper caste population in the country is about 15 percent
 yebijepika mul votbank mana jaataa he
 That is why BJP is called the party of upper castes
 brahman-rajput-kysth, bhoomihaar or vaisya kii party kahi jane vaali bijepi dhire-dhire samaaj ke har tabake kii bich apana dayera badhaane main juty he
 Since the 2014 elections, the BJP has been trying to improve its base among Dalits and tribals, apart from backward-backward castes
 loksabhaa or uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav main iskaa asar bhi dekhne ko mila tha, jisamen modi ke naam par jaateey bandhan ko todakar logon ne bijepi ko vot kiya tha
 There are 543 Lok Sabha seats in the country
 inamen se essi-asti samudaay ke liye 131 siten arakshit hai, jisamen 84 seat anusuchit jati or 47 siten janajati ke logon ke liye hai
 Currently, the BJP has 67 mps from this section
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi koi bhi jokhim bharaa raajnneetik kadam nahin uthaanaa chaah rahi he
 While the opposition has been continuously accusing the BJP of being anti-dalit
 isi kaa nateeja he ki supreme court ke faisle ko bijepi palatney ke liye majaboor hona padaa he
 This decision of Modi government has now become a sore throat
 isi kaa nateeja he ki savarnon kii party kaa tamgaa rakhane vaali bijepi ko usee kaa mul votbank aankh dikhaa rahaa he
 As a result, BJP President Amit Shah has entrusted the responsibility of party leaders and chief ministers to allay and convince the displeasure of the Savarna community
 savarna samudaay bijepi or congress sahit baaki dalon ke khilaaf najar aa rahaa he
 However, BJP seems to have suffered the most from the displeasure of the upper castes
 in savarna sanghathanon kii taraf se virodh ke kram main agle chunaav main nota dabaane kii apil kii ja rahi he
 In such a situation, the upper caste community gets angry, then the results of Gorakhpur and Phulpur may make the BJP to face the consequences

 akashganga main arabon aise grah maujuud ho sakate hai, jin par jivan maujuud ho saktaa he
 This was said in a study
 yah vichaar antarrashtriya antariksh vigyaniyon ke ek dal kaa he, jisaki aguai buckingham vishvavidhyalay ke buckingham estrobilogy centre ke professor or nideshak chandra vikramsinghe kar rahe hai
 According to science journal Astrophysics and Space Science, scientists are of the opinion that these planets equipped with life would have originated in the first few lakh years after the Big Bang
 vaigyanikon kii gananaa ke mutabik har dhai karod varsh main aisa ek akashiya pind saura mandal ke aantarik hisse se gujarata he or is dauraan vah raashichakree dhul (jaudiekal dust) grahan karata he, jisamen saura mandal kii jaivik koshikaon ke bhi kuch tatv maujuud hote hai
 According to the statement of the university, in this way, parts of the life of the solar system are continuously spreading in the Milky Way sky Ganges
 varsh 1995 main jab pehali baar saura mandal se baahar kisi grah ke hone kaa pataa chalaa tha, tab se bade paimaane par anya grahon kii khoj kii jane lagi he
 So far 750 such planets have been detected, but almost all of them are not considered fit to bear life
 tippaniyan Recently some scientific groups have said that there may be billions of such planets in the Akash Ganga
 vikramsinghe or unke saathi vaigyanikon kii gananaa ke mutabik brahmad main aise lakhon arabon grah ho sakate hai or prayek main shuruaati jivan ke sookshm ansh ho sakate hai
 The idea is of a team of international astronomers led by Chandra Wickramasinghe, professor and director of the Buckingham Astrobiology Center at Buckingham University

 According to the calculations of scientists, every two and a half million years, one such celestial body passes through the interior of the solar system and during that time it eclipses the zodiacal dust, which also contains some elements of the biological cells of the solar system
 vishvavidhyalay ke bayaan ke mutabik is tarah saura mandal ke jivan ke ansh milky ve akaash ganga main lagaataar fail rahe hai
 Since the first discovery of a planet outside the solar system in the year 1995, other planets have been discovered on a large scale
 ab tak 750 aise grahon kaa pataa chalaa he, lekin inamen se lagbhag sabhi ko jivan dhaaran karne ke laayak nahin samajha ja rahaa he
 The comments haal main kuch vaigyanik samoohon ne kaha he ki akaash ganga main aise arabon grah ho sakate hai
 According to the calculations of Wickremesinghe and his fellow scientists, there may be millions of such billions of planets in the universe and each may contain microscopic fragments of early life

 Sheila said that they have received the actual details of the incident and the matter will be dealt in a special speedy court
 iske pehle police ne mukhyamantri ke awaas kii ore bad rahi pradarshnakariyon kii bheed ko teetar-bitar karne ke liye pani kii bauchhaarein kii thi

 paanchavi baar main mili yah safalataa kootnithik dhiraj kaa misaal banegi
 On May 1, when no objections were received from China until 9 pm, it was announced that the un's al-qaeda committee put Masood Azhar on the list of global terrorists accused of having links with al-qaeda
 bharat ne pulavama hamale ke baad masood azhar ko aatanki suchi main dalwane kii kavayad kii thi magar china bharat kii daleelon se sahamat nahin hua
 If China did not agree this time, it would have been open to the United Nations, then it would have been difficult for China
 27 farvari ko america, britain or france ne saajha rup se masood azhar ke kilaaf prastaav rakhaa tha
 It was in him that jaish-e-mohammed claimed responsibility for the incident
 13 march ko china ne aapatti laga di thi
 This time the offer was opened again on 23 April
 1 may tak aapatti darj karaane kii samay seemaa rakhi gai thi
 Masood Azhar has been placed in the terrorist list because the committee has found that Masood Azhar has supported jaish-e-mohammed
 jis jaish e mohammad ko sanyukt raashtra kii isi 1267 cameti ne 2001 ko pratibandhit kiya tha
 jaish-e-mohammed was alleged to have had financial and other ties to al-qaeda with the terrorist organization al-qaeda
 is sanghathan ne afghanistan main aatank behaal karne kaa kaam kiya tha
 Masood Azhar is the head of jamaat-ud-dawa
 sanghathan badal-badal kar kaam karata rahaa he
 jaish-e-mohammed claimed responsibility for the incident following the Pulwama attack
 bharat ne is aadhaar par masood azhar ko gheraa tha
 But this time the proposal removed the Pulwama attack
 pakistan or china chaahate the ki pulavama kaa zikr hataa diya jaae
 Therefore, the 1267 proposal does not mention Pulwama and the 2008 Mumbai attack
 sansad par hue hamale kaa zikr nahin he
 The incident of IC 814 is mentioned
 bharat maang karata rahaa he ki mumbai hamale ke maamle main us par mukadmaa chale or sazaa ho
 It would have been nice had Masood Azhar been banned due to terrorist activities in India
 isse bharat ko apane bhugolic kshetra main pakistan kii aatanki gatividhiyon ko bhi manyata milti
 Masood Azhar is our enemy because he is the culprit of the terrorist attacks on India's land
 jo bhi ho use duusare kaarnon se sazaa to mili he
 it's pleasure
 pakistan kah saktaa he ki pulavama kaa zikr nahin he
 It was mentioned to discredit him politically but Masood Azhar is his citizen
 kya al-qaayada se sambandh rakhane ke kaaran pratibandhit hona kam shame kii baat he! bharat or duniya kii nazar ab is baat par hogi ki masood azhar kii giraftaar kab hoti he
 What action does he take against her? pakistan ne kaha he ki vah pratibandh ko lagu karegaa
 The jaish-e-mohammed was banned in 2001
 iske baad bhi kai ghatnaon main is sanstha kaa zikr aata he
 Even then, the same America and the same China continue to have relations with Pakistan
 china ne bhi is ghatana par bayaan jari kiya he
 China has always believed that such work should be based on detailed information, solid evidence, professional grounds and consensus and not prejudice
 sambandhit pakshon se sakaaratmak baatcheet ke baad praasangik deshon ne apane prastaav ko badla he
 China does not mind
 yani china ko jin baton se etraz se tha use maan liya gaya he
 China has also added in its statement that Pakistan has contributed a lot in fighting terrorism
 antarrashtriya samudaay pakistan ko is baat kaa shrey de
 Support Pakistan in fighting terror
 china ne chand rose pehle pakistan ko apane sabhi mausamon kaa saathi bataaya tha
 Pakistan also wanted to make its space mission a success
 maanav yukt yaan bhejnaa chahta he jisamen china uski madad kar rahaa he
 India has achieved long-distance success in the field of astronomy
 wo bhi apane dam par
 Pakistan and China will say their words
 kootnithik taraazoo par batkhara rakhkar nahin taula jaataa he
 Everyone tells weight according to their own
 vishleshan ek taraf
 Ban on Masood Azhar aside
 bharat ne jin kaarnon se prayaas kiya tha wo bhale na maane gaye hon magar jis disha main prayaas kiya tha wo safal rahaa he

 ) The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) may call itself a non-political organization and claims to work in the religious, social and cultural fields
 lekin bharat ke maujuuda raajnneetik paridrishy main wo ek badi takat he
 This is the first time since independence that RSS volunteers have held the three highest constitutional posts in the country
 itnaa hi nahin desh ke aadhe se zyada rajyon main aresas se judi shakhsiyaten hi mukhyamantri hai
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was banned after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi on January 30, 1948
 18 maheene baad sangh par lage pratibandh ko 11 july, 1949 ko tab hataa liya gaya jab tatkaaleen sangh pramukh madhavrao sadashiv golwalkar ne desh ke tatkaaleen grahamantri sardaar vallabh bhai patel kii yah shart maan lee ki sangh apana likhit samvidhan taiyaar karegaa jisamen loktantric dhang se chunaav honge or vah raajnneetik gatividhiyon se puri tarah se dur rahegaa
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh does not directly participate in politics nor contest elections
 lekin parde ke peeche se siyasat main uskaa kaaphi dakhal or niyantran he
 The Sangh remains a pivot in the politics of the present era
 desh ke raashtrapati ramnath kovind, uparashtrapati venkaiya naidu or pradhanmantri narendra modi sangh ke angan se hi nikle swayamsevak hai
 The BJP and its allies have governments in twenty states of the country
 inamen se zyaadaatar rajyon ke mukhyamantri sangh se sidhe jude rahe hai
 Names like Yogi Adityanath of UP, Trivendra Singh Rawat of Uttarakhand, Manohar Lala Khattar of Haryana, Devendra Fadnavis of Maharashtra, Raghuvar Das of Jharkhand
 vahiin, centre kii modi sarkaar main bhi swayamsevak mantriyon kii lambii fehrist he
 The RSS keeps a sufficient watch on the functioning of BJP governments
 sangh iske liye baqayada samanvay baithak bhi karata he
 Through this meeting, the union officials review the functioning of the BJP government
 sangh jaruri hone par sarkaar kii dasha or disha bhi tay karata he
 The Sangh not only controls the government but also controls the BJP
 bijepi or sangh ke bich samanvay ke taur par kaam karne ke liye aresas apane ek padaadhikari ko party main bataur sanghathan mantri niyukt karata he
 Organization minister has an important role in BJP from national organization to district level
 bijepi main sanghathan mantri sansadeey board kii baithkon main jaataa he or aresas kii sabhi badi baithkon main aamantrit kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, he knows the thinking of that political organization and its ideological operator on every burning issue
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh apane teen darjan se adhik sahyogi sanghathanon main se harek ke liye kam se kam ek prachaarak ko sanghathan mantri banaata he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself came to the BJP from the Union as the Union Minister 
 atal-adwani ke daur main bijepi main sanghathan mantri ke liye sangh ne govindacharya ko niyukt kiya tha
 Similarly, at present, Ramlal is working as Organization Minister
 haryana ke rajyapal captain singh solanki empi main bijepi ke sanghathan mantri rah chuke hai
 Today, the party's general secretary Ram Madhav, one of the most powerful BJP leaders at the national level, was also the All India Co-liaison head of the RSS till a few years ago
 bijepi ke liye raajnneetik jameen taiyaar karne kaa kaam bhi sangh karata he
 This is the reason that in states where assembly elections are to be held, volunteers work from house to house seeking votes for the party candidate
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sangh ne puri takat ke saath narendra modi ko piem banane main ahm bhoomika adaa kii thi
 Intervention in politics begins with the Jana Sangh
 dow
 Shyama Prasad Mukherjee founded the Jana Sangh in 1951 with Sangh activists
 1952 main hue aam chunaav main jansangh ne raajnneetik dal ke rup main bhaag liya, use isamen koi khaas safalataa nahin mili
 But his knock in the field of politics was important
 jansangh ko majboot karne main sangh ke prachaarak nanaaji deshmukh, balraj madhok, bhai mahavir, sundarsingh bhandari, jagannatharav joshi, laalkrishna adwani, kushabhau thakare, rambhau godbhole, gopalrav thakur or atal bihari vaajapeyi ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 In 1975 Indira Gandhi imposed Emergency in the country
 sangh ne iskaa purajor tareeke se virodh kiya tha
 The Sangh was a major participant in the movement of Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan
 1977 main janata party kaa gathan hua to jansangh kaa usamen vilay ho gaya
 After this, a Janata Party government was formed in the power of the country, then the leaders who came from the Union became ministers
 janata party kii sarkaar main pehali baar rahaa ki sangh ke log mantri bane
 But later circumstances came that Jana Sangh leaders had to come out of the Janata Party
 iske baad 1980 main bijepi kii sthapana hui
 The BJP raised the Ram Mandir issue to strengthen its base
 1998 main atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv main centre main bijepi kii sarkaar bani
 After this, after 13 months, again in 1999 elections, BJP returned to power again
 lekin paanch saal ke baad 2004 main hue chunaav main bijepi ko satta se baahar hona padaa
 After this, after 10 years, the BJP was able to return to power under the leadership of Narendra Modi with a strong force
 bijepi ke saath-saath sangh kii takat bhi badhati ja rahi he or ye bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki sangh kii takat badhane ke saath-saath bijepi or uske sahyogi sanghathanon kii takat bhi bad rahi he
 The Bihar Chief Minister has hit back at the BJP over allegations of politics over Narendra Modi's rally in Patna
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki bijepi publicity ke liye sansani failaa rahi he
 The state government has nothing to do with the President's visit to Bihar
 bijepi ko aade haathon lete hue nitish kumaar ne kaha, bijepi ke hunkaar raily par koi pabandi nahin he
 But the BJP is deliberately creating controversy for its own benefit
 raashtrapati ke bihar daure par nitish kumaar kahana he ki yah kaarykram raashtrapati bhawan kii ore se tay kiya gaya
 The state government does not play a role in this
 gauratlab he ki bihar ke purv dipti siem susheel modi ne aarope lagaaya he ki nitish kumaar modi kii hunkaar raily ko rokane ke liye har tarah ke hatkande apana rahe hai
 Sushil Modi tweeted, 'first, Nitish Kumar allowed half Gandhi Maidan for Modi's Hunar rally and then the President has been invited to come to Bihar on the same day
 modi ne likhaa he ki 26 or 27 oktober ko raashtrapati patna main honge
 After Sushil Modi, Shahnawaz Hussain also attacked
 nitish kumaar par gandi raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaate hue unhone raashtrapati pranab mukherjee se is chaal ko samajhane kii guzarish kii
 Shahnawaz Hussain had tweeted on Monday morning, 'honorable President is an experienced politician
 ummid karata hum ki ve nitish ke nimantran ke peeche kii chhichhli raajnneeti ko samajhenge
 ' koun kahata he ki aaj ke samay main sachcha pyaar nahin hota
 Even today, people have true love and the love of this couple is indeed an example
 pati ke dil main ek dabi hui khwaahish thi ki wo bhi kabhi harley davidson aayran 883 chalaae
 But it is not so easy to buy Harley Davidson who went to the market and bought it
 aise main pati ne apni is khwaahish ko dil ke ek kone main hi sahej liya
 This story started in the year 2012
 jab gaurav sethi or akhili matta ek party main maujuud the
 Akhili gets a note from Gaurav's wardrobe of clothes
 jisamen likhaa tha '25 agast 2012: sies gaurav sethi' or '11 disambar 2015: harley davidson aayran 883
 At that time, Gaurav and Akhili were girlfriends and boyfriends
 par us note ko padhane ke baad akhili ko ehsaas hua ki gaurav kii jindagi main harley davidsonkitani ahmiyat rakhti he
 If Gaurav could have bought a bike at that time, he might not have even looked to the right or left but he did not have the money to pay for Harley
 yaheen se akhili caprem or samarpanaka anoothaa kissa shuru hua
 She decided that whatever happens, she will live up to this dream of pride and she started depositing money
 paise jamaa karne ke dauraan unhone kai baar bahut si aisi chizon se bhi compromij kiya jisaki unhen bahut jarurat thi
 His only goal was to gift the bike to Gaurav by any date on the date that Gaurav has written in his note
 ant main jab wo din aayaa to unhone us puure din kii ek film banaayi
 Gaurav's blindfold was brought to the showroom of Harley Davidson
 us samay gaurav kya mahasoos kar rahe the use shabdon main bayaan kar paanaa mushkil he
 a few months later Gaurav and Akhili went to Rajasthan with their Harley Davidson
 jaipur main sanjay lila bhansaali kii film padmavati ke set par karani sena ke utpaat se jahaan bollywood aag-babula he, vahiin khud karani sena ko apane kiye par koi afsos nahin he
 He says that the mistake is of Bhansali who is manipulating history through the film
 rajput karani sena ke sansthaapak lokentre singh kalvi ne kaha ki hamaari naak ke nicherajaputon kii dharteeper hamaare purvajon ke itihaas ke saath chhedchhad kii ja rahi he
 He said that things which are not in history should not be shown in the film
 'hitler ke khilaaf banaaen film'kalvi ne kaha ki hamane yahi baat jodha-akbar ke samay bhi kahi thi
 He directly challenged that what is the role of miscreants to go to Germany to make a film against Hitler
 kalvi ne film ke khilaaf karani sena ke gusse jo puri tarah se jaij tehraaya
 In the indecent film 'padmavati' on the sets of the film, Karani Sena created a lot of outrage on the film's set for tampering with historical facts
 sena ke kaaryakartaaon ne nirdeshak sanjay lila bhansaali ke saath abhadrata bhi kii
 The shooting of the film was going on in Jaipur's Jaigarh Fort
 sardiyon kaa mausam aate hi jahaan puraa sharir shushk hone lagata he vahiin honton ke fatne kii samasya bhi ho jaati he
 This is a very common problem
 ye to aap bhi jaanate honge ki hamaare honton kii twachaa, sharir ke kisi bhi duusare bhaag kii tulana main kahin adhik patali or samvedansheel hoti he
 Due to cold winds and changing weather, the moisture of lips is lost somewhere and they start to crack
 aise main ye behad jaruri ho jaataa he ki ham apane honton kaa acchhee tarah se khyaal rakhen taaki wo hameshaa komal, mulaayam or khubasurat bane rahen
 Before we tell you how to take care of the lips, it is very important to know what are the reasons of lip eruption
 mausam badalane ke saath hi hamaari kuch aadaten bhi is pareshaani ke liye jimmedaar hoti hai
 People who chew their lips, turn the tongue repeatedly on the lips or drink less water also have to suffer from this problem
 vahiin saste or ghatiya kism ke rasaynic utpaadon ke istemaal se bhi hont fatne lag jate hai
 Unbalanced hormones can also be another reason for lip eruptions
 agar aapke hont bhi fat rahe hon to apanaaen ye upaay:1
 If your lips are cracked, it simply means that there is a lack of moisture in your body
 bahari taur par aap chaahe kuch bhi laga len lekin jab tak andruni nami nahin rahegi, koi phayda nahin hoga
 2
 sharir main pani kii kami nahin honi chahie
 Even in winter, try to drink 8 to 10 glasses of water daily
 hont suukh rahe hon to un par jeebh pherane kii galati na karen
 3
 aap jo bhi utpaada istemaal karen wo ucch gunvattta vaala hona chahie
 If you want, you can use almond oil or jojoba oil
 4
 Sometimes lip eruptions also occur due to nutritional deficiency
 aise main apane khanpan kaa puraa khyaal rakhen taaki sharir ko kisi tatv kii kami na hone paae
 5
 ungali main thodaa sa deshi ghi lekar hont par halke-halke se massage karen
 This will increase blood circulation and relieve the problem of lip rupture
 chhattisgarh kii rajdhani main yatayaat vyavastha ko sudhaarney ke liye sadak ke bich main lageen desh ke kai mahapurushon kii pratimaayein kinare kar di gai hai, par kalibari chowk par indira gandhi kii pratimaa ab tak sadak ke bich lagi hui he
 Due to this there is a traffic jam, but no one is daring to remove it due to the fear of political turmoil
 shahar ke kalibari chowk main subah se lekar shaam tak trephic kaa kaaphi bura haal rahata he
 One is that there is a lot of traffic pressure due to the taxi stand here, from above there is a jam situation at all times due to schools
 sabase zyada pareshaani kaa saamana tab karnaa padataa he jab subah ke samay skool lagata he or shaam ko skool kii chuttee hoti he
 There are Dani, Kalibari and Mahant Laxminarayan schools along with the Girls Degree College near the Chowk itself
 kai baar yahaan par schuli vidhyaarthiyon ke saath durghatnaayen ho chuki hai
 The Municipal Corporation in April 2012 preferred a letter from the Superintendent of Police to get the divider attached to the statue of Indira Gandhi properly
 yah divyder mahila thane kii taraf se pehle tirachha aa rahaa tha jis kaaran bahut zyada trephic jam kii sthiti rahati thi, ise sidhaa kiya gaya he, lekin iske baad bhi trephic main sudhaar nahin hua he
 Statues of the great men of the country were installed in many places in the capital Raipur, which have been done by the road
 aisi pratimaaon main shastri chowk se bahadur shastri, aaazaad chowk se mahatma gandhi, stesan road se subhachandra bose, viipi road se durgavati, mahila thane ke saamne se madhusudan das, esarapy chowk shankaranagar se shahid bhagat singh, telibandha ravigram se subhaashachandr bose kii pratimaayein shaamil hai
 Keeping in mind that no statue should be an obstacle on the road, the statues of Shyamaprasad Mukherjee at Sharda Chowk, Deendayal Upadhyay at Telibandha Ring Road and Bhimrao Ambedkar at Ambedkar Chowk have already been set aside

 " mahangaai ke liye congress ko jimmedaar tehraate hue mayawati ne kaha ki centre sarkaar kii galat nitiyon kii vajah se mahangaai badi he
 He said that the BSP has always demanded such policies that increase the capital of the common man, not the capitalists

 Not appear check scandal involving mass, because these scams are most people's Congress
 " Mayawati said, "while recommending the investigation of the NRHM case to the CBI, our party had already anticipated that the central government would try to take political advantage under the guise of investigative agencies and this seems to be true
 " Holding the Congress responsible for inflation, Mayawati said that inflation has increased due to the wrong policies of the central government

 Addressing an election meeting in Hargaon, Rahul said that Modi makes big claims to honor women, but the truth is that Modi's Gujarat government does not respect women
 yahi vajah he ki vah mahilaon kii phone par baatcheet ko tepe karwaati he
 Significantly, a similar attack on the Modi government was made by Priyanka on Wednesday at the Nukkad meetings held in Rae Bareli, the parliamentary constituency of her mother Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 unhone kaha tha ki mahila shashaktikaran kii baat karne vaale log kamaron main baithkar mahilaon kii baaten sunate hai
 What would such people do to honor women? rahul ne kaha ki modi ne gujarat main kisaanon kii 45 hajaar acre jameen maatr ek rupee vargametre ke hisaab se ek audyogic samooh ko saunp di
 Not a single industrial unit has been established on that land till date
 unhone kaha ki desh kii raksha ke daawey karne vaale modi ne apni hi party ke varisht netaaon laalkrishna adwani or jaswant singh ko kinare laga diya
 Rahul said that if the Congress-led UPA at the Center had not started the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, the farmers of Gujarat would have died

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator Shankar Singh Vaghela met party vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday amid controversies at the Gujarat Congress
 sutron ke mutabik, shankar singh waghela ne rahul gandhi ko aashwast kiya he ki wo congress nahin chodenge
 Significantly, the news of Vaghela quitting Congress, who recently met BJP President Amit Shah, had heated up the market
 iske pehle waghela ne twitor par rahul gandhi ko anfolo bhi karke maahaul ko or garma diya tha
 However, after this Gujarat Congress in-charge Ashok Gehlot went to Gujarat and met Vaghela, after which Vaghela himself also dismissed the speculation of leaving the Congress
 gujarat main congress nahin degi siem kaa cheharaa-sutron ke mutabik gujarat rajya main congress netaaon kii aapasi khinchataan ke chalaterahul ne waghelako bhi do took baat diya he
 The Congress party will not make anyone the face of the Chief Minister in Gujarat
 rahul kaa maananaa he ki pehle sabhi netaa miljul kar gujarat main party ko satta main laaen phir siem aapas main baithkar tay kar liya jayega
 Rahul has already given this message to all the leaders including another big contender for the post of Chief Minister, State Congress President Bharat Singh Solanki
 pehali chunauti rajyasabha kaa chunaav-aane vaale dinon menvidhansabha chunaavse pehle congress ankaganit ke lihaaj se ek seat jeetne vaali he
 In such a situation, Rahul has already held a long discussion with Congress in-charge of Gujarat Ashok Gehlot and Ahmed Patel for not doing cross voting
 bin modi ke congress kii gujarat jeetne kii ranneeti-darasal congress ko lagata he ki is baar siem ke taur par saamne narendra modi nahin hai
 In such a situation, instead of keeping Rahul at the center, there is a strategy to fight the Congress leaders of the state with the Gujarat BJP leadership
 jisase gujarat kavidhansabha chunaav bijepimodi banaam rahul naa karane paae
 Overall, this time the politics of the Congress is to win Gujarat by taking advantage of anti-incumbency through state leaders and state issues
 lekin arase se congress nai nai ranneeti ke tahat gujarat main ladati rahi he or muhanki khaati rahi he
 Now this time he feels that there is an opportunity and there is no Modi ji in front
