 shiksha ko moulik adhikaar banane ke liye samvidhan main sanshodhan kiye jane ke kareeb aath saal baad sarkaar ne chah se 14 saal ke har bachche ko muft tathaa anivaary shiksha uplabdh karaane ke liye aaj is aitihaasik kanoon ko lagu kar diya
 The 86th Constitutional Amendment, making education a fundamental right, was passed by Parliament in 2002
 is moulik adhikaar ko lagu karaane vaale kanoon ‘bacchon kaa muft tathaa anivaary shiksha praapt karne kaa adhikaar adhinium’ ko sansad ne pichley saal paarit kiya
 The Constitution Amendment Bill and the new law have come into force from today
 nae kanoon ke tahat rajya sarkaron tathaa sthaneey nikaayon ke liye ab yah sunishchit karnaa badhyakaari hoga ki har baccha sameep ke skool main shiksha hasil kare
 This law will directly benefit about one crore children who are not going to school at this time
 ye bachche, jo bich main skool chhod chuke hai yaa kabhi kisi shikshan santhaan main nahin rahe, unhen skulon main daakhila diya jayega
 After the Right to Information Act and the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, the right to education is said to be a major achievement of the UPA government
 mantralay ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki is samay chah se 14 saal aayu varg ke sambandhit virgo main kareeb 22 karod bachche hai
 Although 4 of these
 6 fisadi (kareeb 92 lakh) skulon se baahar hai
 After the enactment of this law, the School Management Committee or local administration will identify children who have dropped out or never gone to school between the age of six years and will be admitted to classes after giving special training according to their age
 kanoon shiksha hasil karne ko har bachche kaa adhikaar banaata he
 The Act makes it obligatory for all concerned governments to ensure that every child receives free primary education
 adhinium main yah bhi anivaary praavdhaan kiya gaya he ki nijee shikshan sansthaanon ko bhi apane yahaan 25 fisadi siten kamjor tabake ke bacchon ke liye arakshit rakhni hogi
 Some schools have already challenged this law in the Supreme Court, calling it 'unconstitutional'
 unhone ise gaiyr sahaayta praapt nijee shikshan sansthaanon ke moulik adhikaron kaa ulanghan qaraar diya he
 But Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal has said that the legal process will not affect the enforcement of the law
 vitt ayog ne is adhinium ko lagu karne ke liye rajyon ko 25 hajaar karod rupaye kii raashi uplabdh karaayi he
 According to the government's estimate, 1 in the next five years to implement this law
 71 lakh karod rupaye kii jarurat hogi
 Sibal said that the government has managed the money required to implement the law
 adhinium ke praavdhaanon main kaha gaya he ki koi bhi skool kisi chaatr ko daakhila dene se manaa nahin kar saktaa or sabhi skulon ke paas prashikshit adhyaaapak hone chahie
 If a school does not have a trained teacher, it will have to arrange it within three years
 nae kanoon ke anusaar, skulon ke paas paryaapt sankhya main teacher, khel kaa maidan tathaa dhanchaagat suvidhaon kaa hona jaruri hoga
 The government will put in place some system to enable some disadvantaged schools to follow the rules of the Act
 sarkaar ne pehle hi kuch adarsh niyam taiyaar kiye hai tathaa nae kanoon ko lagu karne main apane khud ke niyam banane main madad karne ke liye rajyon ko ye adarsh kanoon bheje ja chuke hai
 The Central Government has made separate rules for the Union Territories which will be notified by the Law Ministry next week
 nae niyamon ke anusaar, sthaneey nikaay tathaa rajya sarkarein ghar ghar jaakar tathaa pados ke skulon main surveykshan karengi taaki yah sunishchit kiya ja sake ki sabhi bacchon ko skool bheja gaya he
 The new law will ensure that children from all communities, including minorities and backward classes, get good education
 lekin kamjor tabake ke liye aarakshan is varsh se lagu nahin hoga kyonki satr ke liye daakhile pehle hi lagbhag puure ho chuke hai
 It will be implemented from the year 2011-12

 Holds hoardings, advertises in newspapers, but will give money to journalists for writing articles? Obviously, that article will only be praised
 baad main akhbaar main chape lekh ko uthaakar kitaab bana degi ki dekhie media or patrkaar uski yojanaon kii kitni tarif kar rahe hai
 Is it good Is this supposed to happen? Then why would you buy a newspaper, why would you watch TV? If the ways of influencing journalists and media are found out in different ways, how will the truth of media reach the general public? How would a non resident Indian know that the government has floated a tender to praise the article published in Indian newspapers? Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader Hemant Soren has called it government corruption
 hemanth sorene ne jharkhand sarkaar, press council, kendriya soochna va prasaaran mantralay ko tag karte hue twit kiya he ki ab yah aafitial ho chukaa he ki hamaare mananeey mukhyamantri raghubar das ne naitikta or siddhanton ke sabhi niyam taak par rakh die hai
 The publicity department of the government is advertising openly that journalists write on development and earn money as fees
 hindu akhbaar main rajya ke jansampark vibhaag ke upanideshak ajay nath jha kaa bayaan chapa he
 In which they say that this is not paid news
 patrakaron se aavedan maanga gaya he ki ve sarkaar kii kalyankari yojanaon ke bare main likhen
 His articles can be successful stories and can be critical
 ham apni yojanaon kaa swatantra rup se moolyankan karana chaahate hai
 There is nothing written in the advertisement that the government's plans can be criticized in the articles that will be there
 agar sarkaar ko apni yojanaon par aalochanatmak lekh chhapavane hai to vah patrkaar khud kar sakate hai, yah kaam to akhbaar kaa he
 Are you sure that the audience is so naive that the government will pay and get critical evaluation from independent journalists? Are you able to understand what is news, what is advertising? We have spoken to Pranjay Guha Thakurta, a member of one such committee of the Press Council of India
 praanjay ne kai saal pehle ek upasmiti main kaam kiya tha, 'ped news, haau karpshan in da indian media andermins demokrasi' matlab biki hui khabar kaise bharat ke loktantr ko kamazor kar rahi he
 The 36,000-word report is available on the Press Council of India website
 to aap sochen ki ham kahaan aa chuke hai
 The government is putting out advertisements, asking journalists to praise its plans, get it printed in its newspapers and take money away
 phir bhi up nideshak kehete hai ki swatantra patrakaron se samiza karana chaahati he
 It is clearly written that in his or other newspaper
 
 
 matlab yahi hua ki kisi akhbaar main kaam karne vaale patrkaar bhi aavedan kar sakate hai
 If the government has to review its plans, then why does it not print the CAG report as an advertisement, which costs the public crores of rupees to prepare
 telegraph akhbaar ke achintya ganguli ne 29 disambar 2018 ko ek report chhaapi thi
 This report said that the report of Silk, Textile, Handicraft Development Corporation was presented on the Jharkhand Assembly table
 sieji ne is vibhaag main bade paimaane par vittiya ghotaalaa pakadaa he
 18 by making fake records
 41 karod rupee kambal baantne par kharch kiye gaye
 Will the Jharkhand government give Rs 15,000 to journalists for putting such information in their articles? Will not give at all
 ab aap sochie, upi ke mirzapur ke patrkaar pawan kumaar jaisawal ne koun sa gunaah kiya tha jinke khilaaf exiaar ho gai
 He also presented a review of a government plan that the government spends crores, yet in the mid-day meal, bread and salt are being given to eat
 upi main exiaar or jharkhand main aalochanatmak samiksha ke liye 20,000 hazaar
 There is a trend going on
 har hafte ek nai theme laanch hoti he jis par media bahes karne lagata he or baaki muddon ko bhul jaataa he
 This week's topic is Hindi
 hindi ko lekar bahes yogya bayaan die ja rahe hai
 Similarly, debatable statements were made about Sanskrit, but what happened to Sanskrit? At that time, sentiment was being created about Sanskrit
 banaras kii sadakon par candal march sanskrit ko lekar kyon ho rahaa he phir
 You can say something about Sanskrit, maybe all the channels will start frantically, the city of the city swells up
 lekin sanskrit ko lekar ho rahe is candal march kaa haal dekhie jaise lagata he ki sara banaras aajkal french bolne laga he
 Nobody means Sanskrit
 18 dinon se sampoornanand sanskrit vishvavidhyalay main dharna pradarshan kyon chal rahaa he
 It is a large Sanskrit university in India
 lekin kya aapane paanch saal main iske bare main koi badi khabar suni
 Did any of the leaders who went to Sanskrit go to Sampoornand Sanskrit University by taking oath in Sanskrit or tweeting two or four verses? We often leave the language debate right-left, but never know the state of language-related institutions

 But elections were held, 18 Chowkidars have been removed from Sanskrit University as soon as elections are held
 is uniwarsity par 3 karod bijli bill baaki he
 Whenever there would be debate on language, arms would be stretched, how soon we forgot the political demonstration and debate about Sanskrit
 vahi chiz ham hindi ke saath kar rahe hai
 In June this year, the Minister of Human Resources gave a statement in the Lok Sabha about Sanskrit saying that there are 15 Sanskrit Universities in the country
 inamen se teen dimd uniwarsity hai
 There are 12 campuses known as Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan
 yahaan bhi pachaas fisadi shikshak kantrect par padhaa rahe the
 This information is from some time ago
 baharhaal june maheene main maanav sansaadhan mantri ne bayaan main bataaya ki 12 uniwarsity ko rajya sarkarein fund detii hai
 1000 traditional colleges are associated with them
 jahaan shikshakon ke 1748 pad hai, magar 949 padon par hi shikshak hai
 46 percent of the posts are vacant
 dilli main 490 padon main se 163 khaali hai
 There are 172 sanctioned posts of teachers in UP, but 113 are vacant
 ab upi main sanskrit ko lekar bahes hogi to in sab baton par nahin hogi
 Because all these questions bring accountability, it becomes difficult to answer the questions and the anchors have to work hard to tell them all

 Begusarai remains the laboratory of nationalism in the Lok Sabha elections
 mangalvaar ko sipiai ke yuva ummidavaar kanhaiya kumaar jab nikle to puraa begusarai laal jhandon se pat gaya
 It took him hours from his native village Behat to reach the office of the District Collector
 puraa shahar jam rahaa
 People came in large numbers from the streets of the village streets
 begusarai ko leningrad yaa mini masco bhi kaha jaataa he, lekin kehane vaale kehete hai ki aisi bheed or aisa utsaah pehle kabhi nahin dekha gaya
 The youngsters are seen in great enthusiasm in support of Kanhaiya Kumar, while the film actress Swara Bhaskar is also giving a strong speech from Begusarai's election platform
 swara kaa kahana he ki kanhaiya ko bijepi ne fansaaya he
 False sedition cases were filed against him while Kanhaiya is a true patriot
 swara ne spasht kaha ki bijepi ke rashtrawaad se kanhaiya kaa rashtrawaad sachcha he
 Many student leaders of JNU have reached Begusarai in support of Kanhaiya
 kanhaiya ke saath deshadroh kaa aarope jhel rahi tatkaaleen chaatr sangh kii sadsy shahala raashid or najeeb kii maa bhi shaamil hai
 Jignesh Mevani, the MLA who raised the flag against Modi in Gujarat, has camped in Begusarai

 Kanhaiya's craze is visible in the youth of Begusarai
 kanhaiya ke kafile main kaaphi sankhya main muslim yuva bhi dikhe jabaki begusarai se argedy ne tanwir hasan ko maidan main utaara he
 Muslim youth say that for 2 times he was voting for Tanveer Hassan but he was losing again and again

 CPI cadre vote in Begusarai, if Muslim and all the votes are collected in it, then BJP candidate Giriraj Singh may have difficulties
 mangalvaar ke hajoom ko dekhakar laga ki ab begusarai main sidhaa muqabla giriraaj singh or kanhaiya kumaar main he
 Both come from Bhumihar caste and there is a plurality of Bhumihars in the Begusarai Lok Sabha seat
 begusarai ke logon ko dhire-dhire kanhaiya par yakeen ho rahaa he
 Despite being a stronghold of the Left, the cpi's position here was greatly weakened
 logon kaa kahana he ki jo varsho tak sipiai kii raily main nahin aae the, wo kanhaiya ke nomination main aae hai
 Ramachandra Yadav, 70, is a CPI cadre and belongs to the era of Chandrashekhar Singh
 hameshaa sipiai ko hi vot dete hai lekin raily main kai varshon ke baad aae
 On this seat, business people say that only BJP will win from Begusarai because a lot of work has been done here in the last 5 years
 ganga nadi main 6 len sadak pul ke saath rail brij kaa nirmaan kaary chal rahaa he

 The chairman of the committee, Murli Manohar Joshi, dismissed allegations that the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) was pressurized by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) to speed up the audit work in the 2G spectrum allocation case
 unhone kaha ki yah kaig ko badnaam karne kii durbhaavnapurna sajeesh he jo sanvaidhanik rup se galat, farji or bebuniyaad he
 Joshi told reporters, "in January 2010, the CAG had assured the committee that the report in the 2G case would be ready in six months
 jab is avadhi main report saamne nahin ai, tab maine kaig se report kii sthiti ke bare main jaankaree maangi thi kyonki log is report kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 The committee has the right to get information about this
 ’gauratlab he ki aisi khabaren ai hai ki kaig ke adhikari aar bi sinha ne 13 july 2010 ko apni sahyogi rekha gupta ko ek patr likhaa tha jisamen kaha gaya tha ki piesi adhyaksh murali manohar joshi ne kaig ke adhikariyon par tu ji spectrum aavanton se jude maamle main audit ke kaam main teji laane ke liye dabaav daalaa tha
 Joshi said, 'as a person who believes in the Constitution, i strongly oppose the efforts to discredit the constitutional institutions in this way
 ’unhone kaha ki desh main do-teen sansthaaen aisi he jo sarkaar ke kaamkaaj, uski laaparvaahiyon kii nigaraanee rakhti hai or ghotaalon kaa pardaafash karti he, lekin ab in sansthaaon ko barbaad karne or samvidhan evam sansadeey vyavastha kaa maan kam karne kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 The chairman of the PAC said, "I never summoned the CAG officer but only asked him what the status of the report was because he was the top officer auditing the case
" ’gauratlab he ki sinha ne rekha gupta ko likhe patr main kaha ki doorsanchaar kshetra main piesi kii jaanch se jude ghatnakram main unpar saansadon, media aadi kaa baari dabaav he ki agar jaanch main deree kii gai to karypalika ko is mudde kii lipapoti karne kaa mauka mil jaayegaa
 The letter said that in the year 2008, the process of audit was very slow as documents were not available from dot
 2009 ke ant main sibiai se is maamle main file praapt karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya or in filon ke alok main audit hua
 The CAG informed the PAC in January 2010 that the audit work had been completed and the report would be ready within six months
 aam aadmi party ke sanyojak or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal in dinon goa se lekar gujarat tak prachaar main jute hai
 In such a situation, questions are arising on Kejriwal whether he is keeping distance from Delhi's power
 kyonki vidhansabha ke monsoon satr kii shuruyaat main wo puri tarah se nadaarad dikhe
 Satyendra Jain, who is handling the important ministry of the Kejriwal Delhi government while campaigning, said that while the Prime Minister was addressing the situation, 'arvind Kejriwal is learning from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it has been two and a half years for our Prime Minister, he does not live in Delhi
 ham kam se kam desh main to hai
 The Prime Minister is campaigning abroad like he has to contest international elections
 'jahaan chunaav hoga vahaan jaaenge kejariwal: satyendra jainmukhyamantri ke vidhansabha satr main shaamil na hone ke sawaal par satyendra jain ne kaha ki 'arvind ji desh ke andar hai, jahaan chunaav hoga wo jaaenge
 We are not fighting in all the states
 uttar pradesh main bhi nahin lard rahe
 We will definitely campaign in Gujarat
 somvaar ko unhen goa se unako aana tha
 But when a woman's bakery was burnt, they had to stay there
 jis tarah pradhanmantri bataate hai us tarah ham bhi apana kaam bataaenge
 'kejriwal is monitoring everything, Kejriwal is campaigning for Goa, Gujarat and Punjab and appeals to people abroad to join Aam Aadmi Party
 haal hi main gujarat main chunavi prachaar kii jimmedaari paane vaale kapil mishra kaa kahana he ki 'arvind ji rojaanaa kaam kii report le rahe he ek-ek kaam kii hamaari monitering ho rahi he
 The way in which Arvindji sees us in Delhi gives instructions, in the same way, not even a day goes by when Arvind ji has not taken a report of work
 ' dilli main sarkaar chhodkar baaki rajyon main arvind kejariwal ke prachaar karne vaale sawaal par kapil mishra, pradhanmantri narendra modi kii videshi yatra ke aankade ginate nazar aae
 Kapil said that 'if Modi lived abroad for 225 days in about one and a half years, then who ran the country? People want to call Kejriwal after understanding the model of Delhi
 dillimein sarkari skool kii fees kam ho sakati he to vahaan kyon nahin
 i went to Gujarat, there was no school in an area for 10 years and we have made eight thousand rooms here 'four days' monsoon session of the assembly This time the monsoon session in the Delhi assembly is 4 days
 2 din guzar chuke hai lekin sutron ke mutabik siem mangalvaar subah tak goa main hi prachaar kar rahe the
 Meanwhile, Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia is taking charge of the Delhi government
 khud arvind kejariwal pehle bhi is baat kaa zikr kar chuke hai ki wo desh main party ke sanghathan ko majboot karne ke liye dilli se baahar rahenge
 Perhaps this is also the major reason that Arvind Kejriwal did not keep any ministry in the Delhi government

 Dhoni has not voted in the association just because he is an honorary member, now questions are being raised about the matter, Presidential candidate Ajay Maru is calling it a conspiracy

 He said that if he wins this election, then Dhoni will be made a member of JSCA immediately

 The impact of water in the city has started falling on people's lives
 darasal mahrajganj nepal ke us ilaake ke paas padataa he jahaan se nepal kii pahadiyon se pani aasaani bah kar idhar kii taraf aa jaataa he
 This is the real cause of Maharajganj flood
 All the Rapti, Rohin, Chandan and Thirst rivers except Gandak in Maharajganj district are flowing above the danger mark due to rain water

 70 meters karnataka kii mudhol seat pramukh vidhansabha siton main se ek he
 It is considered the traditional seat of BJP
 rajya main bies yediurppa ke baad bijepi ke duusare number ke netaa ke taur par govind karjol kaa naam aata he
 He is an MLA from this seat and once again BJP made him his face in the election ground
 congress ne yahaan se satish chinnapa bandivaddar ko tikat diya, to vahiin jedy (es) ne shankar nik par daanv lagaaya
 Now the thing to be seen is whether the BJP is able to save this seat or the Congress and JDS are winning the victory from here
 mudhol seat par anya pratyaasheeshivasena ke arvind kambli, republican party of india ke bhimrao kaalavagol, prabud republican party ke ramesh gonyagol, karnataka rajya raiyat sangh ke baswanth lakshmana kambli or ek nirdaleey pratyaashee ne mudhol seat se chunaav maidan main taal thoka he
 Govind Karjol is the leader of the politics of Karnataka whose political status has been the guarantee of his victory
 is seat par bijepi kaa majboot kabja he
 In such a situation, winning this seat is a big challenge for Congress and JDS
 mudhol kshetra kii ek pahchaan duniya bhar main shikari kute kii behatar nasl ke liye he
 The Maharaja of Mudhol presented a pair of hunting dogs to King George v of England in the 1900s

 He is the vice president of the BJP Karnataka unit
 karjol 1994 main janata dal ke tikat par congress ke ummidavaar ramppa balppa ke khilaaf chunaav jite the
 After this, he had to face defeat in the 1999 assembly elections at the hands of Balappa, but after winning the 2004, 2008 and 2013 assembly elections, Govind made this seat a strong fort of BJP
 is baar congress ne govind karjol ko maat dene ke liye apane puraane netaa ramppa balppa kii jagah satish chinnapa bandivaddar ko tikat diya
 However, Ramappa Balappa was asking for tickets
 par party ne satish par bharosa jataayaa
 The party is hopeful that in the strong fort of Govind Karjol, they may be able to win the Congress victory
 jedies ne shankar nik ko yahaan se chunaav maidan main utaara he
 Naik quit the All India Progressive Janata Dal (AIPJD) in 2003 and joined the JDS

 BJP President Nitin Gadkari said on Friday that Congress President Sonia Gandhi wants to make her son and Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi as the Prime Minister of the country, but what will be the benefit? He is tearing paper today, will tear cloth tomorrow
 unamem nehru-gandhi kaa vanshaj hone ke alaava duusari paatrata bhi nahin he
 Gadkari was addressing an election rally in support of BJP candidate Chandrika Prasad Upadhyay from Sadar seat of Chitrakoot district in Uttar Pradesh on Friday
 gadakari ne rahul gandhi dwaara samaajawaadee party kaa ghoshnaa patr phaade jane ko bachakaani harakat qaraar dete hue kaha ki sonia gandhi apane bete rahul ko desh kaa pradhanmantri bananaa chaahati hai, vah pradhanmantri bhi ban gaye to is desh ko kya phayda hoga? aaj saream duusare dal kaa kaagaj faad rahe hai, kal apane kapade phaadenge
 He said that Rahul does not even have the eligibility to become Prime Minister, only the descendants of the nehru-gandhi family are the only eligibility
 muslim aarakshan par samaajawaadee party par prahaar karte hue gadakari ne kaha ki mulaayam singh apni birdari kaa bhi aarakshan khatm karnaa chaahate hai, unhen birdari kii nahin, sirf akhilesh ko mukhyamantri banane kii chintaa he
 He said that 58 crore grains of farmers were rotting
 mukhyamantri mayawati ne 10 hajaar karod rupye ke park banavaa daale, magar ek cold storage nahin banavaa sakin jisase kisaanon kaa anaaj batch jaae
 Addressing a public meeting in Oraiya, Gadkari earlier targeted Congress President Sonia Gandhi and said that the ultimate goal of Sonia's life is to make Congress General Secretary and son Rahul Gandhi the Prime Minister
 gadakari ne kaha ki congress maa-bete kii party he or sonia kaa antim lakshya rahul ko pradhanmantri ke rup main dekhnaa he
 Taking a dig at SP, Gadkari said that just as Congress is a mother-son party, SP is a father-son party
 sonia rahul ko pradhanmantri banane kii taak main hai to mulaayam singh apane bete akhilesh ko mukhyamantri bananaa chaahate hai
 He said that while the Congress is busy looting Delhi, the 'rani' of Lucknow has looted the state fiercely
 bhrashtachar or gundaraj ne pradesh kaa satyanaash kar diya he
 Taking a dig at Sonia, Gadkari said that Congress minister Salman Khurshid had said that Sonia Gandhi cried after seeing the bodies of terrorists after the Batla House encounter
 ab faisla aap kiijie ki jise inspector mohan chandra sharma kii shahadat par aansu nikalne chahie vah aatankwaadiyon kii maut par ro rahaa he
 All this is being done to gain votes

 baari barish ke kaaran baadh jhel rahe bihar main kamala balaan nadi ne raudra rup dhaaran kar liya he
 In Ghanshyampur block of Darbhanga district, dozens of villages have been submerged in the waters of Kamala Balan river
 hajaaron log isse prabhavit hue hai
 For the last 10 days, torrential rains have been raining in many parts of Bihar, due to which about half a dozen districts have been flooded
 nepal main lagaataar barish ho rahi hai
 Due to release of water from Nepal, many rivers of North Bihar are in spate and flowing above the danger mark
 kamala balaan nadi par bana tatbandh kai sthanon par tut jane se darbhanga jile ke darjanon gaanv jalmagn ho gaye
 Thousands of people have been displaced by this
 logon ne oonche sthanon par sharan lee he
 The Bihar government has claimed to have active teams of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) to bring the flood affected people to safer places
 ashiana baha le gai badhghanashyampur block kaa rasiyaari gaanv puri tareeke se jalmagn ho chukaa he
 Local people said that at around 2 am on Sunday morning, the embankment on Kamala Balan broke
 iske kaaran rasiyaari gaanv main pani kaaphi teji se badhane laga or logon ko apni jaan bachaane ke liye surakshit sthaan par bhaagna padaa
 The flood water washed away the thatched huts of many people
 prabhavit log apana keemtee saamaan lekar jaise-taise jaan bachaane ke liye surakshit sthaan par pahunche
 There is anger among the people for not being able to access government help despite the outrageous form of outrage from not getting help
 prabhaviton kaa kahana he ki 2 maheene pehle hue chunaav main netaa unase vot maangane ke liye lagaataar aate the magar ab, jab unhen sarkaar se madad kii jarurat he to unki sudhi lene vaala koi nahin he
 Dam saving exercise: Due to increase in water level in Balan river, the situation of dam breakage has occurred in many other places
 khatre kii jad main aae baandhon ko bachaane kii kavayad main prashasan jute gaya he, lekin aam naagarik baadh aane ke baad marammat par sawaal uthaate hue kah rahe hai ki jal sansaadhan vibhaag ke adhikari itani hi tatparta yadi barsaat se pehle dikhaate to yah naubat nahin aati

 So this is the real reason behind the closing of Kapil Sharma's show! Please tell that Rajin Dhingra was appointed the creative director of Kapil's show earlier
 lekin kaha gaya ki rajeev team ko control nahin kar paae
 Deadlines are not completed
 script samay par taiyaar nahin milin
 This affected the show's quality and the TRP fell even further
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki team ke kai logon ko rajeev bilkul pasand nahin the
 As a result, the entire system of the show collapsed
 isse bhi zyada hairaan karne vaali baat ye saamne aa rahi he ki team ke zyaadaatar log jahaan rajeev ko sho main nahin chaahate the, vahiin kapil chaahate the ki rajeev hi sho ke diarector rahen
 By the way, according to the news that has come in the past, the reason for the closure of the show is Kapil Sharma himself
 unki tabiyat kaaphi kharaab rahane lagi he
 Apart from this, he called many big stars from Shahrukh Khan to Ajay Devgan for the shoot and then made them wait and sent them back

 According to sources, China is developing them in this way, given the strategic position in its village near the outskirts of India

 Please tell that when Home Minister Rajnath Singh visited Laphthal and Rimkhim border outpost near india-china border

 christmas ho yaa naye saal kaa jashn , shimla deshbhar ke paryatakon main khaasaa lokapriy he
 The popularity of Shimla, which was the summer capital of the British, can be gauged from the fact that in this tourist destination, the tourists who celebrate the New Year get their hotel booking done 6 months in advance so that there is no problem of staying in the last days of the year
 kudarti saundarya ke alaava jo cheez paryatakon ko shimla khinch laati he wo he thand
 People wait for snow on Christmas and New Year
 abaki baar kyonki christmas par barf nahin giri to ab paryatakon ko naye saal main barf girane kii ummid he
 Although the temperature in the day is comfortable but at night the temperature has dropped by two degrees, but this winter is not enough for people who want more winter
 log jahaan garm kapadon main bhi thand mahasoos kar rahe hai vahiin kuch log icecream ke stall par jaakar sardi kaa majaa badha rahe hai
 Even though the daytime temperature is comfortable, Shimla nights are extremely cold
 raat kaa taapmaana do degree tak gir jaataa he
 Winter increases when snow falls
 is saal bhi shimla main paryatakon kaa tantaa laga hua he
 The most popular place in Shimla is the crowds of people on the Mall Road
 log chahalkadami or thand kaa majaa lene ke liye in jagahon par aate hai
 There are always cool winds on the ridge field which doubles the fun of the cold
 shimla bhale hi dhire-dhire kancreet ke jangal main tabdeel ho rahaa ho lekin phir bhiparitakonmen iskaa aakarshan kam nahin hua he
 a big reason for this is the cleanliness of popular parts of the city such as Mall Road and Ridge Maidan
 kyonki maal road or rij maidan desh ke sabase saaf-suthri jagahon me se ek hai
 This place of Shimla city is not only prohibited on smoking bidi-cigarette but also has to pay a fine for spitting betel etc
 udhar hotel maalik naye saal par paryatakon ko aakarshith karne ke liye tarah-tarah ke aayojan kar rahe hai
 These include beauty pageants as well as dance and dance programs
 lekin shimla ghoomane aae logon ko jis cheez kaa intjaar he wo he barf
 Although snow has already fallen in places like Kufri and Narkanda, snowfall in Shimla city is no less than a gift for tourists
 shimla main juty paryatakon kii bheed kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki is vakt shimla ke hotel or parking sab phul hai
 If you wish to welcome new year in Shimla, then you will have to move to nearby cities ie Chel, Solan, Kasauli or Kufri
 rajya sarkaar pehle hi kah chuki he ki agar aap shimla aana chaahate hai to pehle hotel booking karvaa len varanaa pareshaani uthaani pad sakati he

 Later, the woman was mounted on the donkey in the village and was tortured throughout the night and she was tied with a peg at the place where the animals were tied
 peedit mahila ne bataaya ki uske pati kii maut kareeb 37 varsh pehle ho gai thi or uski koi aulad nahin he
 Due to this, some villagers used to bother with the intention of grabbing his 30 bighas of valuable land
 jab mahila ne iskaa virodh karnaa shuru kiya, to log use dian bataane lage
 Not only this, the panchayat also threatened to expel the woman from the village
 panchayat ne yah bhi faisla sunaaya ki agar kisi ne mahila se baatcheet kii, to use ek lakh rupee kaa jurmaana bharna hoga
 Even after this, the woman did not leave the village, so in the evening last week, some domineering blackened her naked and then made her sit on the donkey and roamed the village
 peedit mahila kii bhatiji ne kaha ki jab use is ghatana kii jaankaree mili, to vah apni buaa ko apane sasuraal le ai

 The campaign to find Hinges Boson or 'god Particle', which has been continuing for five decades, seems to be reaching its end
 sarn ke vaigyanikon ne daawa kiya ki unhone ek aise sookshm anu (sabetomic partical) ko khoj nikaala he jiske bare main mana ja rahaa he ki vah brahmad kii utpatti main mahatvapurn he
 Joey Incandela, head of one of the two independent teams at the world's largest nuclear research center, told scientists at the packed European Atomic Research Center (CERN) that the data had reached the level of certainty needed for this discovery
 lekin unhone yah pushti nahin kii ki nayaa anu chota hings boson hi he, jiske bare main mana ja rahaa he ki usne brahmad ke sabhi padaarthen ko aakaar or swaroop diya
 Meanwhile, another team of physicists also claimed that they had come to know about a new substance which is probably Hinges Boson

 'reva Pari Se' is not a collection of common poetry, but rather a document of a woman
 apane vakt ko baariki se tatolta, rishton kaa postmortem karata, sach ko talashta sangrah
 
 
 Poems, sometimes reveal the poetry of the poet's mind, and sometimes burst like bubbles with love
 isamen narmada kaa saundarya bhi he or isi narmada ke shokh chulbulate rup kaa aks yani reva kaa salonaapan bhi he, lekin jaise nadi kii talash antaheen hoti he, wo kinaaraa todakar samudr se milane ko betaab rahati he
 An incomplete search is also seen in the poems of Swati, but this search is probably the search of the mind of every woman or every conscious person, who sometimes appears in the night stuck on the Semal tree, then sometimes finds his address in another
 Seeks in the heart of
 kehete hai sahitya main kavita sabase praudh vidha he, lekin bhav ke str par sabase zyada kaishorya isi vidha main he ye bhi sach he
 In such a situation, the pain of detachment from the river is felt when she calls out to 'reva Par Se'
 shaayad wo man ke andar talash kii lalak hi jo kavyitri ko kabhi dhundhlati shaamon kaa zikr karne par majaboor kar detaa he, to kabhi badalon ke peeche bhatakane ko, jo bhi ho par ye tay he ki in kavitaaon main chhipi gahari udaasi ke peeche ummid kii kirane hai
 This first collection of poetry by Swati Pandey Nalavade also raises hope
 ummid kavitaaon main chhipe angadh saundarya ke taraashe jane kaa, taaki agali kitabon main or sughad tareeke se wo nikhar sake or jaisaa ki 'khud aane do roshni
 
 ' kavita main wo likhti hai

 The Indian couple, trying to protect their children, received a major setback on Thursday when Norwegian authorities said they would not execute the agreement to hand over the children to their uncles in view of differences in the family
 bal kalyaan seva (seedblues) ke pramukh gennar torasen ne ek bayaan main kaha, ‘philhal in anischitataaon ke bich seedblyooes yah nahin kah saktaa he ki bacchon ko bharat le janaa unke sarvottam hit main hoga
 The statement also mentions reports of differences between the children's parents Anuradha and Sagarika Bhattacharya

 The uncles of the children were to be given the burden of their protection
 bacchon ke chachaa arunbhash bhattacharya is maamle ke silsile main norway main hai
 Toresen said that the cws's intention to sign and implement the agreement is absolutely clear but the developments of the last few days have made it (the agreement) impossible
 bayaan main kaha gaya he ki is maamle main hui nayi pragatiyon ko dekhte hue stavanger jila adaalat main kal hone vaali sunwaayi ab nahin hogi

 ’ torasen ne kaha ki iskaa arth yah he ki bharat main bachche ek durbhagyapurna yuddh main funs sakate hai
 The head of the Child Welfare Service (CWS), Gennar Torresen, said in a statement, "at the moment, amidst these uncertainties, the CWS cannot say that it would be in their best interests to take the children to India

 com / jzwy3h3fk2 'as long as i am alive i will not let patriotism triumph over humanity
 ' ravindranath tagore ke yah shabd vartmaan daur main kaaphi praasangik lagate hai
 Different views on the definition of patriotism and nationality are coming out after the alleged anti-national slogans at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi
 kanoon main deshadroh kaa kya matlab diya gaya he, is par bhi roshni daali ja rahi he
 In such a situation, it will also be interesting to know what was the opinion of the great man who wrote the freedom for India, who contributed in some way to the independence of the country
 gitanjali mahakavy or raashtragan ‘jan gana man’ likhane vaale mahaan kavi rabindranath tagore, maanavtaa ko rashtriyata se kahin zyada oonche sthaan par rakhte the
 Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, in his book 'argumentative Indian', described Tagore's ideas of nationality and patriotism in a chapter related to Tagore
 prastut he usee adhyay ke kuch sampadit ansh – Social worker and pastor c f Andrews was one of the close friends of Mahatma Gandhi and Tagore
 andruyas in donon ke bich kii charchaa kaa varnan karte hue bataate hai– ‘donon ke vichaar kai muddon par bante hue rahete the
 The first topic of discussion was idol worship
 gandhi iske pakshdhar the, kyonki unhen lagata tha ki janata itani jaldi kisi bhi niraakaar, amoort rup ko sweekaar karne ke laayak nahin hai
 At the same time, Tagore was not always in favor of considering the public as a child
 gandhi europe kaa udhaaharan dete the jahaan jhande ko aradhy samajhakar kaaphi kuch hasil kiya gaya
 Tagore did not seem to agree with this
 doosraa mudda rashtriyata kaa hota tha, gandhi iskaa bachaav karte the
 He used to say that it is necessary to go through nationality to achieve internationalism
 jis tarah shanti ko hasil karne ke liye yuddh se guzaranaa aavashyak he
 ' tagore ke man main gandhi ke liye bahut aadar tha, lekin vah unase kai baton par utani hi asahmati bhi dikhaate the
 Nationalism, patriotism, exchange of cultural ideas, reasoning were some such issues
 har vishay main tagore kaa drushtikon paramparawaadi kam or tarksangat zyada hua karata tha, jiskaa sambandh vishwa kalyaan se hota tha
 Tagore had full support for the freedom movements, but he also had some doubts about patriotism
 tagore maanate the ki deshbhakti ‘chaar diwari’ se baahar vichaaron se judane kii azaadi se hamen rokatii he, saath hi duusare deshon kii janata ke dukh dard ko samajhane kii swatantraaa ko bhi simit kar detii he
 His passion for freedom also included opposition to unrestrained traditionalism, which, according to him, captures anyone from his past
 aazaadee kii ladaai ke dauraan hone vaale andolanon main atirek rashtravaadi rukh kii tagore hameshaa ninda karte the

 Social worker and pastor c f Andrews was one of the close friends of Mahatma Gandhi and Tagore
 andruyas in donon ke bich kii charchaa kaa varnan karte hue bataate hai– ‘donon ke vichaar kai muddon par bante hue rahete the
 The first topic of discussion was idol worship
 gandhi iske pakshdhar the, kyonki unhen lagata tha ki janata itani jaldi kisi bhi niraakaar, amoort rup ko sweekaar karne ke laayak nahin hai
 At the same time, Tagore was not always in favor of considering the public as a child
 gandhi europe kaa udhaaharan dete the jahaan jhande ko aradhy samajhakar kaaphi kuch hasil kiya gaya
 Tagore did not seem to agree with this
 doosraa mudda rashtriyata kaa hota tha, gandhi iskaa bachaav karte the
 He used to say that it is necessary to go through nationality to achieve internationalism
 jis tarah shanti ko hasil karne ke liye yuddh se guzaranaa aavashyak he
 ' tagore ke man main gandhi ke liye bahut aadar tha, lekin vah unase kai baton par utani hi asahmati bhi dikhaate the
 Nationalism, patriotism, exchange of cultural ideas, reasoning were some such issues
 har vishay main tagore kaa drushtikon paramparawaadi kam or tarksangat zyada hua karata tha, jiskaa sambandh vishwa kalyaan se hota tha
 Tagore had full support for the freedom movements, but he also had some doubts about patriotism
 tagore maanate the ki deshbhakti ‘chaar diwari’ se baahar vichaaron se judane kii azaadi se hamen rokatii he, saath hi duusare deshon kii janata ke dukh dard ko samajhane kii swatantraaa ko bhi simit kar detii he
 His passion for freedom also included opposition to unrestrained traditionalism, which, according to him, captures anyone from his past
 aazaadee kii ladaai ke dauraan hone vaale andolanon main atirek rashtravaadi rukh kii tagore hameshaa ninda karte the
 This was the reason why he kept himself away from contemporary politics
 vah azaad bharat kii kalpana karte the, lekin vah yah bhi maanate the ki ghor rashtravaadi ravaiye or swadeshi bhartiya parampara kii chaah main pashchim ko puri tarah nakaar dene se kahin na kahin ham khud ko simit kar denge

 Tagore had great respect for Gandhi, but he used to show the same disagreement on many things to him
 rashtriyata, deshbhakti, saanskrithik vichaaron kii adla badali, tarkshakti aise hi kuch masale the
 In every subject, Tagore's approach was less traditional and more rational, which was related to world welfare
 azaadi se jude andolanon ko tagore kaa puraa samarthan tha, lekin deshbhakti ko lekar unke man main kuch andeh bhi the
 Tagore believed that patriotism prevents us from the freedom to engage with ideas outside the 'char Diwari', while at the same time limiting the freedom to understand the pain and suffering of the people of other countries
 azaadi ke prati unke junun main besabab paramparawaad kaa virodh bhi shaamil tha, jo unke mutabik, kisi ko bhi apane ateet kaa bandi bana letaa he
 Tagore always condemned the excess nationalist stance in the movements during the freedom struggle
 yahi vajah thi ki vah samakaleen raajnneeti se khud ko dur bhi rakhte the
 He used to imagine free India, but he also believed that somewhere we would limit ourselves by completely rejecting the West in the desire of a fierce nationalist attitude and indigenous Indian tradition
 yahi nahin swadeshi kii is atirikt chaah main ham alag-alag shatabdi main bharat par apni chhap chhod chuke isai, yahudee, parsi or islam dharm ke prati bhi ashishnu ravaiya paidaa kar lenge

 Standard SMS Charges Applicable The Supreme Court questioned the Central Government's decision to provide Z-category security to Reliance Industries Ltd Chairman Mukesh Ambani, asking why such persons are being provided security while the common man is feeling unsafe
 court ne aise vyaktiyon ko suraksha pradaan karne par sarkaar kii khinchaai karte huye kaha ki desh main suraksha kii kami ke kaaran aam naagarik asurakshit hai
 The court said that if there was proper security in the capital, then a five-year-old girl would not be raped
 court ne kaha ki amir log nijee surakshakarmiyon kii sevaayen le sakate hai
 The bench headed by Justice GS Singhvi said without naming Ambani, 'we read in the newspapers that the Ministry of Home Affairs has directed a person to provide security to the Central Industrial Security Force
 sarkaar aise vyaktiyon ko suraksha kyon pradaan kar rahi he
 The judges said, "if their security is threatened, then they should take the services of private security personnel
" punjab main nijee kaarobaariyon ko suraksha pradaan kii jaati he lekin ab yah samskruti mumbai tak pahunch gayi he
 'the court said,' We have nothing to do with providing security to any particular person, but we are concerned about the safety of the common man
 ’ yah khandpeeth sarkaar dwaara logon ko di gayi suraksha or laal batti kii gadiyon ke durpyog ke khilaaf uttar pradesh nivasee kii yachika par sunwaayee ke dauraan ye tippaniyan kii
 Earlier, the government had to clarify that the industrialist himself would bear the cost of security after sharp criticism by the Left parties over the decision to provide Z-category security to Ambani
 ek anumaan ke anusaar is suraksha par har maheene 15 se 16 lakh rupee kharch honge jisaki gananaa surakshakarmiyon ke vetan ke aadhaar par kii jaayegi
 These industrialists are new members joining the club of 'Z' category security vips after the Home Ministry decided to provide a squad of armed commanders in view of the security threat
 nyaayadhishon ne janata kii kamai par ativishisht vyaktiyon ko suraksha pradaan karne par vyathit hote huye kaha ki in vyaktiyon ko praapt suraksha ke aadhaar par logon kii suraksha ke khatre kaa akalan karne ke liye naye tareeke par vichaar karnaa hoga
 The judges said, 'what nonsense is this
 yah janata kaa dhan he
 What about the safety of the common man
 ’ court ne kaha ki aapraadhik maamalon kaa saamana kar rahe vyaktiyon ko mili suraksha waapas lee jaani chahie or sarkaar ko laal batti kaa durpyog karne waalon ke khilaaf karrwai kerani chahie
 The judges said, 'once you stop the red light, half of their status will end
 laal batti istemaal karnaa ab haisiyat kii pahchaan ban gaya he
 It is like the British era
 ’isse pehle, sheersh court ne kaha tha ki vah faisla karegaa ki kya ucch padon par asin vyaktiyon ke alaava duusare vyakti apane vaahanon main laal batti or siren kaa istemaal kar sakate hai yaa nahin
 The court had said that the President, Prime Minister, Vice President, President, Chief Justice of the country and head of the Constitutional Institutions and people in similar positions in the states can be provided security, but why red light and security to every person? The court had said that even the chief and the sarpanch are walking around with a red light carriage

 And now we are asking the film makers
 'nite and de' kaa rimek bana rahe ho yaar
 Hrithik Katrina's hot pair are taking you friend
 ection par itani mehnat kar rahe ho yaar
 i would have done some respect to the story also
 'baing baing' film jabardast packaging magar ghatiya script, kamjor acting or sust screenple kaa pitara he
 Understand a little more

 And in the outside corridor, a sister-in-law would say to Bhaiya Ji that 'I didn't understand, romantic films are showing that action'

 What is his motive kya vah vaaki harlin se pyaar karata he

 or phir rahi sahi kasar bich bich main aate gane puraa karte hai
 Songs are good, but one thing is situation
 jo in karnpriy saptakon ke liye jabaran paidaa kii jaati he
 The film's action is good, but in pieces

 That is why it was probably used in the film trailer
 magar zyaadaatar ection seen angreji filmon kii kamjor nakal lagate hai

 And comedy is just a place like celery
 jaahir he ki apach koi nahin bachaa saktaa
 Most people will be impressed by the aggressive promotion of the film and go to 'bang Bang' to make the long weekend worthwhile
 magar yah ek everej regular masala film he
 If you are carrying too many expectations then there can be disappointment, as people were returning after today's houseful show
 to meri salaah he ki jabaran lahalot hone se behatar he ki apane paison ke 'baing baing' se bachein

 NDA parties are taking a pinch on Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 bijepi ke netaa yah kah rahe hai ki haath milaane ke poster ko lekar nitish kumaar ne bhoj radd kar diya tha, aaj kya ho gaya ki ve muskuraate hue haath mila rahe hai
 On the other hand, Lok Janshakti Party President and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said that Nitish Kumar, who had been dreaming of becoming Prime Minister, is knocking on his door today
 bijepi ke varisht netaa susheel kumaar modi ke sansadeey jivan ke 25 varsh puure hone par patna main ek bhavy kaarykram yojit kiya gaya, jisamen kai kendriya mantriyon ke saath-saath bijepi ke varisht netaaon ne hissaa liya
 At the same event, Sushil Modi said that Nitish Kumar was so annoyed that he canceled the banquet after the poster was printed shaking hands with Narendra Modi, but today he is shaking hands with the Prime Minister
 susheel modi ne 1990 se shuru hue apane sakriy raajnneetik jivan ke bare main bataaya jab ve pehali baar patna se vidhayak chune gaye the
 Modi then recounted the 15-year-old Lalu Raj and later narrated the story till he remained Deputy Chief Minister
 susheel modi ne mana ki kuch galtiyaan unase huin, khaskar cabinet vistaar main kuch bijepi mantriyon ke vibhaag badalane ko lekar
 He also blamed Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for some specific mistakes
 unhone kaha ki patna main nayaa sangrahalay banane ke wo khilaaf the, lekin nitish kumaar kii jid kii vajah se vah bana, jis par hoicourt aaj ungali uthaa rahaa he
 Paswan also took a dig at Nitish while the bjp's Jan Lok Shakti Party, an ally of the BJP, is also running a program of activist conference in Patna
 lok janashakti party ke adhyaksh ramvilas paswan nitish kumaar par jabakar nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 Sometimes with regard to land acquisition, sometimes with regard to paddy purchase
 saath main ve yah bhi kah rahe hai ki kabhi nitish kumaar pradhanmantri banane kaa sapana dekh rahe the, par aaj pradhanmantri ke daravaaje par dastak de rahe hai
 The latest circumstances reveal how hot Bihar's politics has become with Nitish Kumar's meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 2010 main bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakaarani kii patna main hui baithak ke dauraan mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne bijepi ke netaaon ko bhoj par aamantrit kiya tha, lekin usee din akhabaaron main nitish or modi ke haath milaate hue poster chap jane ke kaaran nitish naaraaz ho gaye or unhone bhoj radd kar diya tha
 However, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar believes that he did not go to meet the Prime Minister for any political reasons but he met for the benefit of Bihar
 lekin varshon baad kii mulaakaat kaa matlab to log lagaayenge hi
 people will say something

 premium trainon main ‘flixi’ kiraaye ke tahat sarkaar ne baari rakam praapt kiya he
 Railways have earned an additional Rs 671 crore after the 'flexi' fare system was implemented in premium trains like Rajdhani, Shatabdi and Duronto
 shuukravaar ko sansad main sarkaar ne apni kamai ke is aankade kii jaankaree di
 Explain that under 'flexi' fare formula, with every 10 percent berth booked, the base fare increases by 10 to 50 percent
 rail rajyamantri rajen gohen ne ek prashn ke likhit uttar main rajyasabha ko bataaya ki ‘flixi’ kiraaya vyavastha ko sitambar 2016 main shuru kiya gaya tha or november 2017 tak is yojana se hone vaali atirikt aay, pichley varsh kii samaan avadhi ke mukaable, kareeb 671 karod rupee kii hui
 Gohain said that the railways had recently constituted a committee to look into this system and asked for a better option keeping in mind the interests of passengers and railways
 ghaataa kam karne ke liye railway ne uthaaya tha kadambata den ki rail mantralay ne duranto, rajdhani or shatabdi memflexi fere systamalagu kiya gaya he
 Under this, the base fair gets increased by 10 percent if 10 percent of the seats are booked
 railway ne yah faisla ghate se ubarne ke liye liya tha
 Such is the 'flexi' fare calculator
 Under this system, 10% of the seats available in all these trains are booked on the original fare
 yani agar kisi jagah kaa mul kiraaya 100 rupee he to pehle 10 fisadi tikat 100 rupee ke base price par book hogen
 After booking 10 percent seats, the next 10 percent tickets of Rajdhani and Duronto will be booked on the basis of Rs 110
 iske baad agle 20 fisadi tikat kii booking ke baad agle 10 fisadi tikat 120 rupee par book hogen
 After 30 per cent tickets are booked, the next 10 per cent tickets will be booked at Rs 130
 isi tarah 40 fisadi tikat book hone ke baad agle agle 10 fisadi tikat kii booking 140 rupee ke dar par hogi
 Special discussion was held with BJP MP from Unnao Sakshi Maharaj on the UP election and many issues related to it
 sakshi maharaj ke mutabik isi sarkaar ke rahete ayodhya main bhavy ram mandir banaaya jayega
 Read what the BJP MP has to say on many other issues
 sawaal:upi chunaavse pehle ram mandir kaa mudda ek baar phir uchhal gaya he
 Yogi Adityanath says that when no one can stop the structure from breaking, then who will stop it from being built? Answer: i have been saying from the beginning that there was a grand temple of Bhagwan Ram
 chota hi sahi ram mandir he or rahegaa
 No power in the world will stop the construction of the grand Ram temple
 sawaal:kaise or kab banegaa ram mandir?jawaab:isaki chintaa karne kii jarurat nahin he
 Hindus and Muslims here are making their plans
 saath lakh musalamaanon ne hastakshar karke diya he or hamaari muslim bahanen bhi aage ai he ki mandir bananaa chahie
 i think there is no denying that, but there is some technical problem, which will go away quickly
 mandir nirmaan ke liye ham log aage badhenge
 Question: Will a temple be built under this government? Answer: a grand and divine temple will be built under this government and visit with me
 sawaal:maanav sansaadhan rajyamantri ramshankar katheria ne kaha he ki shiksha kaa bhagavakaran jaruri he or desh kaa bhi bhagavakaran hoga?jawaab:unke shabdon ke arth kaa anarth nikaalane kaa prayaas media kar rahi he
 i also say that saffron is a symbol of nationalism
 jehad aatankwaad kaa pratik he
 In what sense he used the word saffron, i have not heard
 ramshankar katheria ke kisi shabd kaa mandan-khandan main nahin kar saktaa, lekin yah jarur kahata hum ki bhagava ko algaavvaad se jodakar nahin dekha ja saktaa
 Question: You say that if the wedding procession without the groom does not look good, then in UP, will the BJP contest elections on the cm's face? Answer: i say that without the groom's wedding procession does not look good, but the BJP is the largest democratic party in the country 
 yah mulaayam singh kii party nahin he, jisamen saifai ke alaava or doosraa naa ho
 Mayawati does not have a party with no face other than Mayawati
 bijepi ke paas darjanon chehre hai, lekin sansadeey board jis chehre ko aage karegi, party usee chehre ke netritv main chunaav ladegi or do tihaaibahumat se sarkarbanaayegi
 Question: But do you believe that the face will benefit? Answer: Yes, i believe that the face will benefit, but Modiji has such a big face that modi-modi is happening all over the world
 uttar pradesh main modi kaa jaadu aaj bhi kaam kar rahaa he
 Question: Should Varun Gandhi do it further? Answer: i have not heard in this context
 aap pataa nahin kahaan se soochna lekar aa rahe hai
 Question: SP is accusing BJP of polarizing the Kairana incident, what do you have to say in this matter? Answer: See there is a saying in Bihar, do not know the courtyard
 ek or kahawat he khisiani billi khamba noche
 This is the condition of the Uttar Pradesh government
 sapa se pradesh sanbhal nahin rahaa, puure rajya main gundaraj he
 You did not see the incident in Mathura, who had brought up the sin of Ramvriksha? i have also seen the list of 340 people given by the MP of Kairana
 kai media vaale usko sahi se dikhaa rahe hai
 For the first time the media has tried to show the right thing
 isliye media dhanyavad kii paatr he
 We want Kairana not to become Kashmir, we want Kandla not to become Kashmir, but whenever the SP government comes, facilities are provided here on the basis of caste
 yahaan par jati ke aadhaar par nyaay diya jaataa he
 Everything is done on the basis of communalism
 ek badi khai khodne kaa kaam to mayawati karti hai, congress karti hai, mulaayam singh karte hai, lekin aarope bijepi ke upar lagaate hai
 After all, who got the riot of Muzaffarnagar? Who drove 346 people from Kairana? If Sakshi Maharaj did not drive away, then i would humbly ask Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav to install 300, if not 346 before the election comes
 ham to itane saal ke baad kashmiriyon ko sthapit karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai

 chaandi ek chamakdaar or safed dhaatu he
 Silver is considered to be a major metal used in our lives everyday
 dharmik drushti se chaandi ko atyant pavitra or satvik dhaatu ke rup main bhi mana jaataa he
 According to the scriptures, it originated from the eyes of Lord Shiva Shankar
 chaandi jyotish main chandramaa or shukr se sambandh rakhti he
 Silver controls the body's water element and phlegm metal
 chaandi madhya moolyawaan hone ke kaaran zyada prayog kii jaati he
 Therefore, silver is considered very important in the life of the common man
 kaise karen chaandi ke divya prayog-- chaandi kaa challa kanishtha ungali main dhaaran karnaa sarvottam mana jaataa he
 Due to this the inauspicious moon starts giving auspicious effects and the balance of mind becomes very good
 - chaandi kii chen ko gale main bhi dhaaran kiya jaataa he
 By wearing this, speech becomes pure and our hormones begin to balance and speech and mind remain concentrated
 - shuddh chaandi kaa kadaa dhaaran karne se vaat pitt or kaph niyantrit hote hai or hamaara sharir swasth rahata he
 We don't get sick very often
 - chaandi ke gilaas yaa katori main pani pine se sardi zukam or sheetaj rog hamen nahin sataate
 - By consuming pure honey with a silver bowl or spoon, the body becomes toxic
 - shuddh chaandi ke lote se doodh, dahi, ghi, shahad, shakkar (panchamrita) somvaar ke din bhagwaan shiv ko arpan karne se sharir ke rog khatm hote hai
 The mind becomes calm and the inauspicious state of the planets does not affect us
 chaandi ke prayog main kin-kin saavdhaaniyon kaa paalan karen
 - The purer the silver, the better
 - chaandi ke saath sona mishrit karke vishesh dashaon main hi pahan sakate he
 Do not mix any other metal in silver except gold
 - chaandi ke bartanon ko hameshaa saafe karte rahen, tabhi unka prayog karen
 - People who have more emotional problems should be careful in the use of silver
 - kark, vrishchik or min raashi waalon ke liye chaandi hameshaa uttam he
 - Silver is not very favorable for Aries, Leo and Sagittarius
 - baaki raashiyon ke liye chaandi ke parinaam saamaanya hai
 - In some special circumstances, Panchadhatu is made by mixing 4 metals with silver on the advice of a scholar and it is worn at an auspicious time
 kaise hamaare sharir or grahon par asar daalati he-- shuddh chaandi ke prayog se man majboot hone ke saath-saath dimag bhi tej ho jaataa he
 - Use of pure silver forces the afflicted moon and the moon starts giving auspicious effects
 - chaandi kaa prayog karke shukr ko balavaan kiya ja saktaa he
 - By using the right and pure quantity of silver, we can remove the toxin accumulated in the body and our skin becomes radiant

 He said that BJP and RSS want to create a dalit-muslim free India
 desh main hindutv vicharadhara ko thopa ja rahaa he
 Both Dalits and Muslims should unite against such efforts and say that they will not accept the ideology of Hindutva
 ovaisi ne ye baat somvaar ko maharashtra ke aurangabad main ek jansabha main kahi
 'sangh Parivar wants to suppress the weak' Owaisi said that in the current era, Muslims and Dalits need to be aware

 If the BJP wants to make this country Muslim-free, the RSS wants to make this country Dalit-free
 'sangh kii vicharadhar ke khilaaf dalit-muslim ekta'unhone kaha ki sangh parivaar kii vichaardhaara or inke guru golwalkar, headgavar se lekar saavarkar kii tak vichaardhaara muslimon ko hindu banane kii he
 In such a situation, there is a need now that the dalit-muslim union should unite against such efforts and say that they will not accept Hindutva

 'three divorce bill is against women' and in the presence of 40 thousand people in the common ground of Gambad, Owaisi opposed the three anti-divorce bill

 soshal media ne date karne ke tareeke ko bhi kaaphi had tak badal diya he
 Many times you find true love on these sites, and many times deceptions are also found in this way
 online dating aaj kaaphi aam baat ho chuki he
 But don't let this common thing mess with your life
 ek survey ke mutabik online dating cites par aajkal sabase zyada jhooth bolaa jaataa he
 If you are dating someone online, then to avoid the fraud of ISDET, know about the biggest lies spoken on online dating
 
 
 1
 Hide age: In online dating, boys and girls often hide their age
 kai baar duusare logon kii photo daalkar ek-duusare ko impress karne kii koshish bhi karte hai
 In such a situation, with the help of photo editing software, they show their looks quite differently
 2
 The boys always say exaggeratedly about their jobs on the impressive job site
 unhen jis tarah kii ladki talash hoti he, vah usee tarah kaaphi soch-samajhakar naukari ke bare main likhte or bataate hai
 If your online dating partner also tells you about your job exaggeratedly, then you need to be careful
 3
 Talking emotional about family, girls have a soft corner about family and family, so boys take advantage of it
 wo aksar apane parivaar waalon ke bare main aisi baaten karte hai jisase ladki unase imotional taur par jud jaae
 Avoid getting into such things
 4
 If there is a boy or girl fraud in online dating, then there are very slow in sharing photos
 unke dating acount main kuch chuninda tasveeron hi hoti hai
 If you are also talking to a similar person, then understand that there is a flaw in his intention
 5
 Describing oneself as very beautiful or everyone's liking, beauty has always prevailed over beauty and some people use this to fool people
 90 pratishat ladakiyon ko tol, dark or handsam ladke pasand hote hai or aisi baaten tivi par bhi khub dikhaai jaati hai
 These things are often used by such boys to impress girls
 isi tarah ladkiyaan bhi khubasurat or samajhadaar hona kaa jhootha dikhaava karke ladakon ko dhokhaa detii hai
 6
 mithi baaten karnaa:apni tarif sunanaa kise pasand nahin hota or isi baat ko aise log apni dhaal banaate hai
 By winning your choice, you win your heart
 zyada mithi baaten karne waalon se bachakar rahen
 7
 apni pareshaaniyon kii duhai dekaronline dating site par is tarah ke ladke auraladakiyon ko imoshnalbaten or apane dukhon ke bare main bataakar apane patarnar kii sahanubhuti paa lete hai
 Later, he often uses these things to cheat his partner
 agar aap online dating main dhokhe se bachanaa chaahate hai to in baton kaa dhyaan rakhen or is vishay par saal 2010 main ai hollywood film 'trust' jarur dekhen
 
 
 To what extent online fraud can be fatal, you will definitely get an idea by watching this film

 Hope is the emotion that inspires you to struggle with conflicts
 ummid par hi to sara sansar tikaa he
 Writer Sanjay Sinha's 'hope' is a lesson to all of us that no matter what happens, do not give up hope
 ummid kaayam rahegi to manzil avashya milegi
 Sanjay Sinha's three compositions are 'rishtey', 'zindagi' and 'samay', the fourth episode in the composition series 'asha'
 baat agar lekhan kii ho to sanjay sinha kii lekhan kii gati ati saraahneey he
 Being constantly active is the passion of Sanjay Sinha and also the passion because Sanjay has a wide Facebook family
 is parivaar ke kisi na kisi sadsy ke saath koi na koi ghatana ghatit hoti hi rahati he or sanjay use aatmsaat kar lete hai or phir chal padati he drut gati se sanjay kii lekhnee
 Whether Sanjay's experience is small or any big event, he has tried to prove from every experience that the lamp of hope should be kept alive in every condition only then the gift of life will be received
 ummid ke phulko kabhi murajhaane mat dijie
 Today, Sanjay has faced the sting of his running life and his loneliness and has seen it in the life of others
 'misses sanem' kii mahila akut sampatti kii malkin hone ke baavjood bhi akeli isliye he kyonki uske pati ke paas uske liye samay nahin he
 According to Sanjay Sinha, 'there is no fruit on the tree of relationships unless there is fertility of affection in it
 ' sach bhi yahi he ki mahanagaron kii sabase badi traasadee bhi yahi he ki yahaan bheed main rahakar bhi sab akele hai
 This loneliness sometimes affects our mental state
 kisi kaaran ham apane man kii bhadaas kisi aise vyakti par nikaal dete hai jiskaa koi kasoor nahin hota
 Sanjay expresses this sentiment in the 'victory of defeat' title
 akelaapan, avsaad vyakti ko tod detaa he or vah bhavavesh main aatmahatya jaisaa kadam uthaa letaa he
 Sanjay Sinha's book 'asha' can fill the life of many people
 chote-chote prasangon se badi-badi gahari baaten sanjay ne spasht kii hai
 After reading it for a moment, it seems that we too often face similar dilemma and do not share it with anyone
 abhi bhi kuch nahin bigadaa ummid kaa daaman thamiye, bikharate rishton ko sahej kar rakhie taaki akelepan main koi to aapke saath ho
 Today, the person has become zero because the relationship is forgotten
 rishte nahin hai to jindagi kaise ji paaenge
 Therefore, recognize the value of time and light the lamp of hope in the hearts
 sanjay sinha ni:andeh maatr ek lekhak hi nahin hai balki ek ati samvedansheel vyaktitv hai
 Sanjay guides someone by becoming his brother
 kahin maa kii mamata ban jate hai to kahin bahan kii dua
 Somewhere, by extending the hand of friendship, they embrace the fallen and it is here that instead of the knowledge-oriented, the powerful becomes stronger
 sanjay isi baat par bal dete hai ki 'sansar sirf or sirf komal hday ke balboote par chal saktaa he' lekhak kaa aisa kathan kuch alag hi myne rakhata he
 For example, scissors should not be used on the thread whose knot can open
 ' sanjay kaa yah kathan bada sandesh detaa he ki komalta se ham kisi kaa bhi hday jeet sakate hai to duusari ore kathorta se bahut apane kahe jane vaale rishte bhi taar-taar ho jate hai
 If you look around you, violence, intolerance is dominated all over the world
 har vyakti khud ko sahi or sarvshereshth siddh karnaa chahta he
 In such an environment, 'hope' of Sanjay Sinha raises a lot of hope that people will read, feel and bring changes in themselves
 man kii granthiyaan khul jaaengi or jindagi ko bharpoor jeene kii ummid jaagegi
 Sanjay then writes that 'write the story of sorrows on sand and the story of happiness on stone
 ' tabhi to amit hongi khushiyaan
 Every relationship has its own importance, just touch of understanding and affection if needed
 lekhak ne badi sahajata se mata-pita, santan, pati-patni, mitra or raah chalate anjaan vyakti se bhi rishte kii vyakhya kii he
 We get to learn a lot from life experiences
 khaskar hamaare bado ko anubhavon se jo musiibat se hamen baahar nikaal laate hai
 The only condition is that the hope should never be broken
 'jahaan ummid hoti he vahaan jindagi hoti he, jahaan pyaar hota he vahiin sansar hota he
 'just look in the corner of your mind
 kahin aap akelepan se ghabaraakar tut to nahin rahe
 Give time to your family and relationships
 dusron main bhi acha dhundie or khud kii bhi achchhai or takat ko pahachaanie
 The title 'ranchhod' is enough to open the eyes
 kabhi-kabhi jaanboojhkar bhi dushman yuddh ke liye isliye uksaate hai taaki ham usamen funs jaaen
 Just like Jarasangha encouraged Shrikrishna, but Shrikrishna left the battlefield and called Ranchod
 puranic katha ke madhyam se sanjay sinha ne spasht kar diya he ki aavesh main koi kaam na karen
 Intelligence is the solution to the problem
 rishte keval khun ke hi nahin hote balki ghadi do ghadi kaa parichay bhi kabhi na tuutane vaali majboot rajju kii bhaanti hamen baandhe rakhata he
 Sanjay may have lost his mother and brother untimely, but even today in this era of technology, we can connect our relationship with emotion
 sanjay se yah siikhaa ja saktaa he jinka fasebuk par lanbaa-chaudaa parivaar he
 You too get lonely and get dazzled by the twinkling of relationships
 akelaapan hamaari apni nakaaratmak soch he
 If the thinking is positive then the unknown person also becomes his own
 sanjay sinha kii pustak 'ummid' swaagat yogya he
 From his personal experiences he has proved that we do not lose from outside challenges but from the weaknesses within us
 man ke band gavaakshon ko kholie ummid kii kirane andar aane dijie or phir dekhie man kaa kurushetra banjar nahin rahegaa balki haraa-bharaa ho jayega
 Hearty congratulations to Sanjay Sinha that he is filling the light of 'hope' in the mindlessness of his readers
 pratiksha rahegi sanjay ke ek or nae prayog kii jisase sanjay ke anubhav unke pathakon ke dilon par chhap chodenge

 The Chief Minister said with the intention of boosting the morale of the desperate workers from the party's defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, that there is no need to lose courage by losing, as the party has always fought against communalism by walking on the path of secularism and will do so further
 
 akhilesh ne kaha, ‘ham chunaav bhale hi haar gaye hon, par ham apni raajnneetik vichaar dhara ko chhodne vaale nahin he

 Now Mahendra Singh Dhoni is working on a new plan for African batsmen
 dhoni ko nets main kaaphi kamawiketcapingki practice karte hue dekha gaya he
 But according to a report in the Times of India, Dhoni spent a lot of time in wicketkeeping practice before the third match in South Africa
 jo ki africa ballebaajon ke liye dhoni kaa ek nayaa plan he
 There are many reasons behind this
 chunki, africa main in dinon pani kii kaaphi kami he aise main pichon par bhi kam pani kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 Due to lack of water in the pitch, there is a possibility of change in it
 aise main ballebaaj agar chahalkadami karata he to wicket ke peeche dhoni kii bhoomika bad jaati he
 Recently, Dale, the batting coach of the African team, believes that African batsmen are working on a different plan to play Indian spinners
 iske liye practice main kai local spinner gendbaajon ko bhi bulaayaa gaya tha
 He said that we will try to stop the ball before it is spinned, that is, the batsmen will advance on the pitch and face the Indian spinners
 aise main dhoni kaa ye master plan team india ke liye sahi sabit ho saktaa he

 aam aadmi party kii political afares cameti (PAC) ne vishwaas ko hataakar deepak vaajapeyi ko rajasthan kaa nayaa prabharee banaaya he

 AAP ne rajasthan se bhi kii kumaar vishwaas kii chuttee, deepak vaajapeyi nae prabharee Dussehra mango of Malihabad this year people will get very little food
 pichley kai saal ke baad is saal uttar pradesh main aam kii paidaavaar kam hui he
 Every year, Dussehri mango used to appear in the market in the last days of May, but this year will come in the market in June
 darasal, udyaan evam khaadya prasanskaran vibhaag ke anusaar dashahari samet anya aam kaa utpaadan 15 se bees lakh ton hone kii sambhaavna he, jo har saal hone vaale utpaadan ke aadha se bhi kam he
 In this regard, President of Mango Production Association and Director of National Park Board, Isram Ali says that mango production this year is 40 percent of last year's production
 unhone kaha ki dashahari aam ke bazaar main 10 june tak aane kii sambhaavna he jisaki keemat 50 rupee prati kilo se kam nahin hogi
 Isram Ali said that bad weather and insects in mango trees have affected production
 pichley mausam main tej thand tathaa kam barsaat ke kaaran aam kii fasal prabhavit hui
 This is not only the case of Dussehra, but the same is the case with other varieties of mangoes
 kharaab mausam ke kaaran is saal aam ke pedo par paryaapt manjar nahin lage
 The producers were unable to properly irrigate the trees due to lack of complete water supply
 ali rajya sarkaar se koi sahaayta nahin mil paane kii bhi shikaayat karte hai or bijli kii aniyamit aapurti par afsos karte hai
 He says that the state government does not get any subsidy subsidy for mango growers
 aam niryaatkon ko 13 pratishat rajya sahaayta di jaati he, jo kaaphi kam he
 Ali says that this year the production of mangoes has decreased in the entire country, whether it is Alphonso of Maharashtra or Mango produced in Andhra Pradesh

 When asked about this, senior Haryana minister Vij said, "when will the couple get together" darasal khemka kaa anil vij se purana naata rahaa he
 Earlier, when Vij was the Minister of Science and Technology, Khemka was posted as Principal Secretary in his department
 vij pehle bhi kai muddon packshok khemkake saath khadey dikhaai die hai
 Let us know that Khemka's name came in the discussion in the year 2012 when he canceled the land deal between the company of Robert Vadra, the son-in-law of Congress President Sonia Gandhi and the real estate company DLF
 khemka apni eemaandaaree ke khub naam kama chuke hai, lekin unhen kai baar iskaa khamiyaja bhi bhugatna padaa
 He has had a confrontation with three ministers of the BJP government in Haryana due to the irregularities and irregularities exposed by Ashok Khemka
 shaayad yahi vajah rahi ki pichley 1991 batch ke is adhikari kaa 24 saal ke kariyar main 51veen baar tabadalaa kiya gaya
 While some people are focusing on Khemka's association with Anil Vij, his transfer is considered good for his career, but Khemka did not appear much himself

 desh main dengue kaa kahar jari he
 The sting of dengue has left people unaware
 roj dengue ke nae cese saamne aa rahe hai
 The way dengue has been spreading over the past few years is a matter of concern
 agast or sitambar maah main yah beemaari apana asar dikhaanaa shuru karti he
 Like every year, this year too many lives have been lost due to dengue
 dilli ke kisi bhi aspataal main pahunch jaaie, dengue kahar machaata hua dikh jayega
 People get scared and reach the hospital as soon as they get fever
 san 2006 se yah beemaari har saal kai logon kii jaan le rahi he
 In the last five years more than 850 people have died due to this disease
 yah aankade sarkari hai, asaliyat main kahin zyada logon kii maut hui hogi
 When the disease started in 2006, 50 people died in the country
 san 2009 main dengue ne 80 logon kii jaan lee
 This figure keeps increasing every year
 san 2012 main sabase zyada 242 logon kii isse maut hui
 i am giving this data because we all know how the politics of statistics continues in our country every day
 centre se lekar rajya sarkaar tak apane vikaas kii aankade pesh karti rahati hai lekin dengue ke asar ke badhate aankade pichhadati swasthya sevaaon kii ore hi ishaara karte hai
 Every year if deaths due to dengue are increasing, it means that our government has failed somewhere, be it the state government or the central government
 ham desh ke dushman ko rokane main to kaamyaab hue hai lekin dengue ke machhar ko rokane main kaamyaab nahin hue hai
 Politicians are playing an innings of politics every day regarding dengue
 kuch bhi ho jaae hamaare rajaneta apni harakat se kabhi baahar nahin aane vaale hai
 People are dying due to dengue, but political parties are busy throwing mud at each other
 aap dekh sakate hai, dilli main aam aadmi party or bijepi kaise ek duusare se lard rahi hai
 Even the weeds of death have not changed our politicians
 emsidi par kabza karne vaala bijepi kaa kahana he ki aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne is saal uske health bajet main katautee kar di he jisaki vajah se vah dengue ko rokane main kaamyaab nahin ho paa rahi he
 But the MCD has been occupied by the BJP since 2007, while deaths due to dengue have occurred every year
 kya tab bhi bajet kii samasya thi? On the other hand, the Delhi government is also blaming the MCD for this situation in Delhi
 dilli sarkaar kaa kahana he dilli ko saaf-suthra rakhana or jan swasthya kaa dhyaan rakhana emsidi kaa kaam he
 Dengue mosquitoes have also woken the Congress from sleep
 congress ke kai bade netaa dilli ke mukhyamantri aravind kejariwal ke ghar ke saamne dhaaraney par bhi baith gaye the or is dauraan 'kejariwal hosh main aao' jaise naare laga rahe the
 Congress is behaving as if there was never a death due to dengue during the Congress rule
 san 2006 se lekar 2013 tak dilli main congress kii sarkaar thi or is dauraan har saal dengue kii vajah se mautein hoti raheen
 Even then Congress and BJP were throwing mud at each other
 agar is saal ko chhod diya jaae to 2010 or 2011 main dilli main sabase zyada mautein hui thim
 Eighty-eight people died in Delhi due to dengue in both these years
 tippaniyan But still i believe that the government of Delhi has failed to stop dengue somewhere this time
 abhi tak dengue kii vajah se dilli main 20 logon kii maut ho chuki he
 Dengue is not a new disease, the government knew that every year people die from this disease, but still the government did not take any concrete steps to stop it in time
 jab dengue kii vajah se bacchon kii maut hone lageen tab sarkaar harakat main ai
 The government of Delhi is keeping track of its work to reach people through advertisements but there is no special advertisement for how to prevent the disease like dengue
 logon ko bhi apana dhyaan khud rakhana padegaa
 It is wrong to forget your responsibility by assuming responsibility of the government
 apane ilaake ko saaf-suthra rakhana logon kii bhi jimmedaari he
 Dengue-spread mosquitoes breed in water stored around the house
 jahaan bhi pani jamaa hua he us par dawaai daalana or safai rakhana jaruri he
 Whenever symptoms of dengue such as high fever, red rash appear on the body, severe pain in the whole body, vomiting, dizziness, then one should go to the hospital immediately and check for dengue
 dengue kaa test har sarkari aspataal main hota he
 Those who fall in the EWS quota can also get treatment in private hospitals for less money
 yadi dengue ke ilaaj ko lekar koi samasya aa rahi he to sarkaar kii helpline number 1031 par sampark kar sakate hai
 When your leaders are not changing, then change yourself and take care of yourself
 san 2006 main jab yah beemaari shuru hui tab desh main 50 log iske shikaar hue the
 In 2009, dengue killed 80 people
 har saal yah aankada badhata ja rahaa he
 In 2012, maximum 242 people died due to this
 main isliye yah aankade de rahaa hum kyonki ham sabhi jaanate hai ki roj hamaare desh main kaise aankadon kii raajnneeti hoti rahati he
 From the center to the state government keeps on presenting its development figures, but the rising numbers of dengue effects point towards the lagging health services
 har saal agar dengue kii vajah se maut bad rahi hai to iskaa matlab yahi he ki kahin na kahin hamaari sarkaar fail hui he, chaahe vah rajya sarkaar ho yaa centre sarkaar
 We have managed to stop the enemy of the country but have not been able to stop the mosquito of dengue
 dengue ko lekar rajaneta roj siyasat kii pari khel rahe hai
 Whatever happens, our politicians are never going to come out of their action
 dengue kii vajah se logon kii maut ho rahi he, lekin rajnatik dal ise lekar ek duusare par keechad phenkane main jute hai
 You can see how Aam Aadmi Party and BJP are fighting each other in Delhi
 maut kaa matam bhi hamaare rajanetaaon ko badal nahin paaya he
 The BJP, which has taken over the MCD, says that the Aam Aadmi Party government has cut its health budget this year, due to which it has not been able to stop dengue
 lekin emsidi par to bijepi ke kabza 2007 se he, jabaki dengue ke vajah se logon kii mautein har saal hui hai
 Was there still a budget problem? udhar dilli sarkaar bhi dilli ke is haal ke liye emsidi ko jimmedaar tehra rahi he
 Delhi government says it is the job of MCD to keep Delhi clean and take care of public health
 dengue ke machharon ne congress ko bhi neend se jagaa diya he
 Many big leaders of the Congress also sat in front of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's house and were shouting slogans like 'kejriwal senses come'
 congress aisa bartaav kar rahi he ki jaise congress ke raaj main kabhi dengue kii vajah se maut nahin hui thi
 From 2006 to 2013, the Congress was in Delhi and during this period, deaths due to dengue continued every year
 tab bhi congress or bijepi ek-duusare par keechad phenk rahe the
 If left this year, Delhi had the highest number of deaths in 2010 and 2011
 in donon saalon main dengue se dilli main aath -aath logon kii mautein huin
 The comments lekin phir bhi main maanata hum ki dilli kii sarkaar kahin na kahin is baar dengue rokane main vifal hui he
 So far 20 people have died in Delhi due to dengue
 dengue koi nai beemaari nahin he, sarkaar ko pataa tha ki har saal is beemaari se logon kii mautein hoti hai, lekin phir bhi sarkaar ne isko rokane ke liye samay rahete koi thos kadam nahin uthaaya
 When children started dying due to dengue, the government came into action
 dilli kii sarkaar apane kaam kaa hisaab vigyaapan ke jariye logon tak pahunchati rahatu he lekin dengue jaisi beemaari ko kaise roka jaae, iske liye koi khaas vigyaapan nahin hai
 People also have to take care of themselves
 sarkaar kii jimmedaari maanakar apni jimmedaari bhul janaa galat he
 It is also the responsibility of the people to keep their area clean
 dengue failaane vaale machhar ghar ke aasapaas jamaa pani main paidaa hote hai
 It is necessary to keep medicine and cleanliness wherever water has accumulated
 jab bhi dengue ke lakshan jaise tej bukhaar,sharir par laal-laal chakatte dikhaai dena,puure badan main tej dard hona,ulti hona ,chakkar aana jaise lakshan dikhaai de rahaa ho to turant aspataal janaa chahie or dengue kii jaanch karaani chahie
 Dengue is tested in every government hospital
 jo log EWS kota main aate hai vah privet aspataal main bhi kam paise main ilaaj kara sakate hai
 If there is any problem related to the treatment of dengue, then you can contact the government helpline number 1031
 jab aapke netaa nahin badal rahe hai to khud apane aapako badal lijie or apana khyaal khud rakhie
 i am giving this data because we all know how the politics of statistics continues in our country every day
 centre se lekar rajya sarkaar tak apane vikaas kii aankade pesh karti rahati hai lekin dengue ke asar ke badhate aankade pichhadati swasthya sevaaon kii ore hi ishaara karte hai
 Every year if deaths due to dengue are increasing, it means that our government has failed somewhere, be it the state government or the central government
 ham desh ke dushman ko rokane main to kaamyaab hue hai lekin dengue ke machhar ko rokane main kaamyaab nahin hue hai
 Politicians are playing an innings of politics every day regarding dengue
 kuch bhi ho jaae hamaare rajaneta apni harakat se kabhi baahar nahin aane vaale hai
 People are dying due to dengue, but political parties are busy throwing mud at each other
 aap dekh sakate hai, dilli main aam aadmi party or bijepi kaise ek duusare se lard rahi hai
 Even the weeds of death have not changed our politicians
 emsidi par kabza karne vaala bijepi kaa kahana he ki aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne is saal uske health bajet main katautee kar di he jisaki vajah se vah dengue ko rokane main kaamyaab nahin ho paa rahi he
 But the MCD has been occupied by the BJP since 2007, while deaths due to dengue have occurred every year
 kya tab bhi bajet kii samasya thi? On the other hand, the Delhi government is also blaming the MCD for this situation in Delhi
 dilli sarkaar kaa kahana he dilli ko saaf-suthra rakhana or jan swasthya kaa dhyaan rakhana emsidi kaa kaam he
 Dengue mosquitoes have also woken the Congress from sleep
 congress ke kai bade netaa dilli ke mukhyamantri aravind kejariwal ke ghar ke saamne dhaaraney par bhi baith gaye the or is dauraan 'kejariwal hosh main aao' jaise naare laga rahe the
 Congress is behaving as if there was never a death due to dengue during the Congress rule
 san 2006 se lekar 2013 tak dilli main congress kii sarkaar thi or is dauraan har saal dengue kii vajah se mautein hoti raheen
 Even then Congress and BJP were throwing mud at each other
 agar is saal ko chhod diya jaae to 2010 or 2011 main dilli main sabase zyada mautein hui thim
 Eighty-eight people died in Delhi due to dengue in both these years
 tippaniyan But still i believe that the government of Delhi has failed to stop dengue somewhere this time
 abhi tak dengue kii vajah se dilli main 20 logon kii maut ho chuki he
 Dengue is not a new disease, the government knew that every year people die from this disease, but still the government did not take any concrete steps to stop it in time
 jab dengue kii vajah se bacchon kii maut hone lageen tab sarkaar harakat main ai
 The government of Delhi is keeping track of its work to reach people through advertisements but there is no special advertisement for how to prevent the disease like dengue
 logon ko bhi apana dhyaan khud rakhana padegaa
 It is wrong to forget your responsibility by assuming responsibility of the government
 apane ilaake ko saaf-suthra rakhana logon kii bhi jimmedaari he
 Dengue-spread mosquitoes breed in water stored around the house
 jahaan bhi pani jamaa hua he us par dawaai daalana or safai rakhana jaruri he
 Whenever symptoms of dengue such as high fever, red rash appear on the body, severe pain in the whole body, vomiting, dizziness, then one should go to the hospital immediately and check for dengue
 dengue kaa test har sarkari aspataal main hota he
 Those who fall in the EWS quota can also get treatment in private hospitals for less money
 yadi dengue ke ilaaj ko lekar koi samasya aa rahi he to sarkaar kii helpline number 1031 par sampark kar sakate hai
 When your leaders are not changing, then change yourself and take care of yourself
 dengue ko lekar rajaneta roj siyasat kii pari khel rahe hai
 Whatever happens, our politicians are never going to come out of their action
 dengue kii vajah se logon kii maut ho rahi he, lekin rajnatik dal ise lekar ek duusare par keechad phenkane main jute hai
 You can see how Aam Aadmi Party and BJP are fighting each other in Delhi
 maut kaa matam bhi hamaare rajanetaaon ko badal nahin paaya he
 The BJP, which has taken over the MCD, says that the Aam Aadmi Party government has cut its health budget this year, due to which it has not been able to stop dengue
 lekin emsidi par to bijepi ke kabza 2007 se he, jabaki dengue ke vajah se logon kii mautein har saal hui hai
 Was there still a budget problem? udhar dilli sarkaar bhi dilli ke is haal ke liye emsidi ko jimmedaar tehra rahi he
 Delhi government says it is the job of MCD to keep Delhi clean and take care of public health
 dengue ke machharon ne congress ko bhi neend se jagaa diya he
 Many big leaders of the Congress also sat in front of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's house and were shouting slogans like 'kejriwal senses come'
 congress aisa bartaav kar rahi he ki jaise congress ke raaj main kabhi dengue kii vajah se maut nahin hui thi
 From 2006 to 2013, the Congress was in Delhi and during this period, deaths due to dengue continued every year
 tab bhi congress or bijepi ek-duusare par keechad phenk rahe the
 If left this year, Delhi had the highest number of deaths in 2010 and 2011
 in donon saalon main dengue se dilli main aath -aath logon kii mautein huin
 The comments lekin phir bhi main maanata hum ki dilli kii sarkaar kahin na kahin is baar dengue rokane main vifal hui he
 So far 20 people have died in Delhi due to dengue
 dengue koi nai beemaari nahin he, sarkaar ko pataa tha ki har saal is beemaari se logon kii mautein hoti hai, lekin phir bhi sarkaar ne isko rokane ke liye samay rahete koi thos kadam nahin uthaaya
 When children started dying due to dengue, the government came into action
 dilli kii sarkaar apane kaam kaa hisaab vigyaapan ke jariye logon tak pahunchati rahatu he lekin dengue jaisi beemaari ko kaise roka jaae, iske liye koi khaas vigyaapan nahin hai
 People also have to take care of themselves
 sarkaar kii jimmedaari maanakar apni jimmedaari bhul janaa galat he
 It is also the responsibility of the people to keep their area clean
 dengue failaane vaale machhar ghar ke aasapaas jamaa pani main paidaa hote hai
 It is necessary to keep medicine and cleanliness wherever water has accumulated
 jab bhi dengue ke lakshan jaise tej bukhaar,sharir par laal-laal chakatte dikhaai dena,puure badan main tej dard hona,ulti hona ,chakkar aana jaise lakshan dikhaai de rahaa ho to turant aspataal janaa chahie or dengue kii jaanch karaani chahie
 Dengue is tested in every government hospital
 jo log EWS kota main aate hai vah privet aspataal main bhi kam paise main ilaaj kara sakate hai

 The current session of Parliament is about to end, but it is very disappointing to look at the work done during this period
 15veen loksabhaa kaa ek-tihaai se adhik vakt hangaame kii bhent chadh chukaa he
 There are about 100 Bills pending before Parliament, some of which are even 20 years old
 15veen loksabhaa main in sabhi kaa paarit hona mushkil lagata he, kyonki iskaa kaarykaal ab sirf do saal bachaa he
 The opposition party Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has held Parliament hostage for more than a week, demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) on coal block allocation
 is loksabhaa ko lagbhag teen saal ho chuke hai or is dauraan ab tak iskaa ek-tihaai se adhik vakt barbaad ho chukaa he, jabaki isse pehle kii loksabhaaon main kaam kahin adhik hua
 According to the PRS Legislative Research data, two Prime Ministers in the 9th Lok Sabha (1989–91), which lasted only 16 months, were badl-v
 pi
 Singh and Chandrashekhar, but this did not affect the functioning of the Parliament, rather it met for 754 hours over 654 hours of scheduled time and 63 Bills were passed during this period
 isi tarah 11veen loksabhaa kii avadhi bhi haalanki kam rahi
 During this time, three Prime Ministers changed - Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Devgowda and I
 ke
 Gujral, but also the functioning was not affected
 nirdhaarit samay 750 ghante ke bajaay iskaa satr kareeb 813 ghante chalaa or is dauraan 61 vidheyak paarit kiye gaye
 Vajpayee became Prime Minister again in the 12th Lok Sabha, but his government could run only for 13 months
 iske baavjood sansad kaa kaamkaaj maujuuda samay kii tarah prabhavit nahin hua
 There were 574 hours of work in the House against the prescribed 528 hours and 56 Bills were passed

 He said, 'in the 1950s and 1960s, where the session of Parliament used to be 120 to 140 days in a year, now it is 60 to 70 days

 The middle class of this country did not think of Air India as less than a diamond studded in the crown of democratic India
 lekin halaat badal chuke hai
 Since then, many airlines have sprung up and things like the national airline have become irrelevant in the western world
 iske baavjood singapore, sanyukt arab emirate (yuai) jaise deshon kii rashtriya vimaan seva unki ek pahchaan ke taur par aati he
 Then why so much ruckus on Air India? This is not understood while the government repeatedly swears that it is working for the 'common man'
 aakhir pradhanmantri ne 2009 main swatantraaa diwas ke apane abhibhaashan main jo kaha tha ki ve air india ko doobane nahin denge, uskaa kya matlab tha?aakhir ek saarvajanik upkram ke taur par air india main aise koun-se surakhaab ke par lage the ki alag se uskaa zikr kiya janaa pradhanmantri ko jaruri laga? vaise bhi pichhali sarkaar ne 2001 main air india kaa nijeekaran karne kaa faisla kiya hi tha (sabhi unionon ke puure samarthan ke saath) jo puri prakriya ke baavjood ant main naakaam rahaa
 If this happens, then this company, trapped in the trap of government mismanagement, would have been better today
 ab tak upie sarkaar dwaara air india kaa nijeekaran na karne kaa faisla samaj se baahar he, jabaki saarvjaki upakramon ko bechney kaa silsilaa lagaataar jari he
 a former civil aviation minister in the UPA, considered by many to be the most capable minister of the department, claimed that his role was neither in ordering the purchase of a large number of aircraft (much more than the original proposal ), Nor was it in the decision to merge the two government airlines, as these decisions came from below which later received cabinet approval
 is baat ko bahut se log sweekaar nahin karte jabaki maujuuda mantri ne vilay ko galati ke rup se sweekaar kar liya he
 Air India has had a wonderful past
 haal hi main hue puunji nivesh (jo badhata hi ja rahaa he) ko chhod den to sarkaar ne chah dashak ke iske kaarykaal main mul 154 karod ru
 Did nothing but invest
 shuruaati varshon main company ne acha phayda kamaaya, mumbai or videsh main parisampattiyaan banaain, hotel kharide or apane paise se hi hanger or staff quarter bhi banaae
 But over the years, these assets have been sold to meet costs
 baharhaal, maujuuda karj 10 arab dollar kaa he (yani 50,000 karod ru
 ) Or even more (which is mainly government guaranteed money)
 is patan kii kahani 2005 main shuru hui jab air india ke liye 111 (67 lambii duuri ke) or indian airlines ke liye 44 vimaanon kaa baari-bharkam order diya gaya
 This culminated in 2007 when the gom and the Cabinet decided to merge the two companies into the National Aviation Company
 vilay kii prakriya ko sahi tareeke se puraa nahin kiya gaya, vahiin sheersh prabandhan main lagaataar badlaav hote rahe
 The cadres of the two airlines, especially the pilots, were not properly integrated and the work was left to the Justice Dharmadhikari who had to give their findings in 2011
 japan airlines (jaal) sabase badhiya haalia udhaaharan he ki kaise koi airline farsh se arsh par sirf nitigat upayon ko apnaane or lagu karne ke raste pahunch sakati he
 Nine months ago, when 78-year-old chairman Kazuo Inamori took over the trap, the company was declared ill
 company ne 25
 Declared its bankruptcy under a debt burden of $ 6 billion
 ghate ke root or kamgaaron kii baari-bharkam fouj kaa isamen kaaphi yogadan tha
 The most famous Japanese entrepreneur turned the airline's fortunes and today the company is profitable
 thik aise hi satyam computers main desh kaa sabase bada ghotaalaa hua tha, lekin tech mahindra ne company (ab mahindra satyam) kaa adhigrahan kar liya or 2008-09 main do arab dollar ke ghate vaali company 2009-10 kii pehali chamahi main 2,500 karod ru
 Came into profit iske thik ulat air india ke maamle main sarkaar ne kuch udyogpatiyon or ek avkashprapt air chif marshall ko board main baitha diya
 But they could not make any significant changes
 chah maheene ke bheetar hi niyukt kiye gaye videshi profeshnal logon ko waapas baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya
 The question arises that even if the government does not want to sell Air India, why did it not allow private management to take command of it? The example of Sri Lanka will work here
 sarkaar kii 100 fisadi bhagidaari vaali srilankan airline kaa 40 fisadi hissaa emirates airline ko 1998 main bech diya gaya tha
 Emirates got all the rights to manage the loss-making Sri Lankan aviation service
 ab vah hissedari sarkaar ne waapas le lee he or airlines kii sehat durust he

 He claimed that after the sixth and final phase of voting on 20 November, his alliance will be in power again in the state

 prasad ne kaha ‘aaj ham pradesh main vidhi-vyavastha, sadakon sahit anya vicasonmukhi kaaryo ke sahare janata ke bich gaye’

 Claiming that the RJD had no hope of forming the government, he said that who would be his deputy chief minister would be the brother of LJP supremo Ram Vilas Paswan or there would still be a lot of doubt about whether there would be any minority
