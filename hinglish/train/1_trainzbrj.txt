 Input IANS atharah saal pehle 1998 main rashtriya natya vidhyalay (enesdy) ke rangamandal ne 'tajmahal kaa tender' jaise jabardast vyangy naatak khelkar theatre kii duniya main halchal machaa di thi
 This drama written by Ajay Shukla, a railway officer, goes on tightening today's corrupt system
 badshaah shahjahan apni priy mummo kii yaad main jald-as-jald tajmahal tamir karwaane ke liye tender dalavaate hai or vah prakriya har kadam par ulajhati hi jaati he
 The audience, which made the audience laugh a lot, continued to be played at festivals until 2007 due to its success, then it was discontinued for some reason
 pichley dasek saal vaise bhi enesdy rangamandal ke bad se badtar hote jane kii dastaan kehete hai
 Earlier, he used to have tens of such dramas which, apart from having deep messages and literary values, were equally entertaining
 khayr, tajmahal kaa tender ke nirdeshak chitaranjan treepathi ko rangamandal ne 9 saal baad yaad kiya
 Meanwhile, he shifted to Mumbai and started acting in films, acting, music and direction etc
 ab pichley ek pakhwaade se jutakar unhone abhinaytaon kii ek nai team ke saath yah naatak phir se taiyaar kiya he
 The play will be played at Rangani Mandal's Summer Festival from 1 to 4 June at Kamani Auditorium in Delhi
 naatak ke ant main shahjahan ke mar jane par thekedaar gupta ji kaa naukar sudhir puch baithta he: 'sar ab kya hoga?' jawaab miltaa he: 'kuch nahin, sudhir, is desh ko gupta hi chalaate aae hai or aage bhi gupta hi chalaate rahenge

 The devotees who come here are quite fond of the special kind of Sangam arrow made
 mahakumbh ke triveni pushp arail main in sabhi mandiron ke puraane pandalon kaa jirnoddhar karaayaa ja rahaa he
 The models are being designed almost like the original structure of the temple so that devotees can get a glimpse of the Badrinath, Kedarnath and Ram Janmabhoomi
 khaas baat yah ki ye khubasurat model mahakumbh ke baad bhi sangam nagari ko dharohar ke rup main mil jaaenge or shraddhalu hameshaa inkaa darshan kar sakenge
 Models of Badrinath, Kedarnath and Ram Janmabhoomi are being renovated by the Allahabad Development Authority
 in tirthasthanon ke alaava bhi arail main bane pushp vihaar main kai aitihaasik dharoharon kaa bhi navinikaran karaayaa ja rahaa he
 Significantly, lakhs of devotees have also started settling as Kalpavasi towards Arail, in such a situation, the importance of these temples built in Triveni flower increases even more
 in sab par kul 50 lakh rupee kii laagat aa rahi he lekin isamen ek baat yah bhi he ki ye model kumbh tak puri tarah se taiyaar nahin ho sakenge
 An official associated with the Development Authority says that models of Triveni Pushp Badrinath, Kedarnath and Ram Janmabhoomi are being prepared
 ye abhi se shraddhaluon dwaara pasand kiya ja rahaa he
 Yes, it is definitely that people are getting a little frustrated due to not being fully prepared
 adhikari bataate hai ki iske peeche soch yah thi ki videshon se aane vaale shraddhaluon ko kyon na desh ke pramukh tirth sthanon kaa ek model dikhaaya jaae jisase unke man main iske prati utsukata jage
 Daniel of Australia, who came to see these works made half-incomplete, calls it a unique thing
 danniel ke mutabik apane saanskrithik viraasat ko duniya ke saamne is tarah pesh karnaa vaaki laajawab he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a speech in English at Kisama, the venue of the Hornbill Festival held in Nagaland in December 2014, while he has always been speaking in Hindi, even in his foreign tours
 itnaa hi nahin, unhone vahaan maujuud bheed ko apane saath naga rashtravaadi naaraa ''kucanlim" bhi lagane kaa aahvaan kiya, jiskaa arth hota he ''nagaalim kii jeet ho"
 In the rest of the country, Modi has always been shouting "bharat Mata Ki Jai"
 kai log is badlaav ko rajya ke pruthakatavaadiyon tak pahunch banane kii unki koshish ke taur par dekhte hai
 Since India's independence, militant movements have been going on continuously
 yah daleel aanshik taur par sahi ho sakati he lekin unka mukhya makasad nagaland ke mul logon kii party ke taur par bhaajapa ko sweekaarya bananaa tha
 This is only one chapter in the grand story of the bjp's mission to the Northeast
 party iske liye saare samjhaute karne ko raji he—modi ne hindi or bharat mata ko kinare kar diya or bhaajapa ne bhi ''bif raajnneeti" ko is ilaake main aakar taj diya
 This is a difficult target for the BJP
 kul 60 siton vaali meghalaya vidhansabha ke liye 2013 main hue chunaavon main bhaajapa 13 siton par ladi or sabhi par uski jamaanat jabt ho gai
 1 of her total votes
 27 fisadi hi hasil hua
 In the Lok Sabha elections held a year later, he did not win any of the two Lok Sabha seats in the state but his vote percentage increased to 9
 16 ho gaya
 The BJP performed slightly better in the 2013 assembly elections in Nagaland
 vahaan bhi 60 sadasyon vaale sadan main usne 11 siton par chunaav ladaa or ek par jeet gai
 His bail was forfeited in eight seats and a total of 1
 75 fisadi mat hasil hue
 In the Lok Sabha elections, the party gave the only seat of the state to its then ally Naga People's Front (NPF)
 un chunaavon ke paanch saal baad is baar bhaajapa uttar-purv ke in donon isai-bahul rajyon main sarkaar kaa hissaa hone kii jugat main he
 Nagaland has 88 per cent and Meghalaya 75 per cent Christians
 china se badhate kshetreey tanaav ke bich bhaajapa purvottar ke rajyon main janaadhar badhaane ko aatur he
 All militant groups, including ULFA, are active in the area and many of them are reportedly taking refuge in China

 Then, after winning the electoral victories in Nagaland and Meghalaya, BJP will also be able to answer these pleas that it is a party of Hindus only
 bhaajapa ke purvottar main apane saathi dalon ke saath milakar banaae gaye sanghathan north east democratic elliance (nida) ke sanyojak or assam ke vitt mantri hemanth biswa sarama kaa kahana tha, ''nihit swaarthon vaale samoohon ne bhaajapa ko keval hinduon kii party ke rup main dikhaane kii koshish kii he
 If we come to power in these states, it will send a worldwide message
 "mahaj 25 loksabhaa or 14 rajyasabha siton vaale is kshetra ke aath rajyon main bhaajapa ke jarurat se zyada dhyaan ko lekar kai sawaal uthaae gaye hai
 But for the BJP, this number is also important in the mathematics of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 khaastaur par tab, yadi vah kuch bade rajyon main 2014 ke apane pradarshan ko doharaa paane main naakaam rahati he jab usne madhya pradesh main 29 main se 27, gujarat main sabhi 26, rajasthan main sabhi 25, uttar pradesh main 80 main se 71, chhattisgarh main 11 main se 10, karnataka main 28 main se 17 or bihar main 40 main se 22 siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 The anti-incumbency trend worries the party's leaders, which has come out in the recent by-elections in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh and the Gujarat assembly elections
 yahi vajah he ki bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah party ke aadhaar ko deshbhar main failaane kii koshish main hai
 "our performance in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in some states was exceptionally good," says Sarma

 But the road has not been easy for him in Meghalaya and Nagaland, where the church has considerable influence
 nagaland baptist carch council ne rajnatik dalon se apil kii he ki ve bhaajapa ko rajya main satta main aane se roke
 To entice Christians, the RSS has been trying to bring local issues into the national debate

 As part of the strategy, the association has also retrospectively supported non-christian organizations such as the Jaliang Rang Harakka Association of Gaidinlu's followers

 “BJP has taken many symbolic steps

 In January, Kannanathanam spent Rs 70 crore for the repair and maintenance of 37 churches and 11 other shrines

 The Congress made it an election issue and accused the BJP of trying to bribe the church

 The bjp's mission in Meghalaya and Nagaland also depends on the electoral success of the three regional parties — the NPF and the National Democratic People's Party (NDPP) in Nagaland and the National People's Party (NPP) in Meghalaya
 congress-virdohi maton ko ekajute karne ke liye kshetreey partiyon ke saath bhaajapa kaa gathbandhan assam or manipur ke chunaavon main kaamyaab rahaa he
 Though the NPF and NPP have refused to be part of any pre-poll alliances with the BJP, they are the constituents of the ruling NDA at the Center

 Kiran Rijiju, bjp's election in-charge for Nagaland, announced a pre-poll alliance with the NDPP on 3 February
 unhone kaha, ''ham 20 siton par chunaav ladenge jabaki andipeepi 40 siton par pratyaashee khadey karegi

 Within a week of announcing boycott of assembly elections by a total of 11 parties with the support of top Naga civic groups, it prepared the NDPP to withdraw from the call for this boycott

 The direction of social organizations forced him to take this stance
 in samoohon main nagaland kii sheersh janajaatiy sanstha naga hoho bhi shaamil he
 Even Naga separatists, including the NSCN (IM), warned political parties not to sabotage historical talks and participate in elections
 sarama kehete hai, ''kuch swaarthee takatein chunaavon main adnga lagaana chaahati thim lekin bhaajapa ne logon kii ichha ko parakh liya or vah chunaav main shaamil ho gai
 The rest of the parties followed suit

 a boycott would mean allowing the BJP to form the government in the state, just like in 1998, when Naga groups announced a boycott of elections and the Congress was the only party to contest the elections, it cleared everything

 Instead of being ashamed of her obesity, Sara made her a source of income
 shuru main aisa karne main unhen jhijak mahasoos hoti thi ki log unke khaane ke ek ek niwale par takataki lagaae dekhte the
 But as she became popular, people started requesting to meet her personally
 dhire dhire log unase aisi demand bhi karne lage ki wo ek baar sara ko apane upar baithaana chaahate hai
 Many men ask Sara to sit on top of them and also pay for it
 sara ko yah ajeeb lagata he, lekin log mahasoos karnaa chaahate hai ki moti ladki ko apane upar baitaane kaa anubhav kaisaa hota he
 During this time also Sara is wearing her vest top and shorts
 wo kisi bhi kaam ke liye neude nahin hona chaahati hai
 Obesity and heavy weight have never been a problem for Sara
 saal 2008 main, 20 saal kii umr main bhi, unhone tite kapadon main apane glamer shots internet par post kiye the
 She believes that big figures have their own different sex appeal, and she likes to show her figure
 unke paas apana behtareen lingeri collection he, jise wo apane alag-alag videos main dikhaati hai
 Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalitha has been admitted to the Apollo Hospital in Chennai for two weeks
 apollo aspataal ne guuruuvaar ko jari taaja health bulatin main kaha he ki siem jayalalita kii haalat main sudhaar ho rahaa he lekin unhen lambey samay tak aspataal main rahane kii jarurat he
 The hospital has said that AIIMS specialist and British doctor Richard John Beale is also monitoring Jayalalithaa's treatment
 jayalalita ko saans lene main dikkat or diabetes kii dawa di ja rahi he
 CM is also being given antibiotics
 tamilnadu kii janata khaskar jayalalita ke samarthak 'ammaa' kii vaapasi kaa besabri se intjaar kar rahe hai
 a variety of things are being said about Jayalalithaa's ill health and her absence from government work
 in sab ke bich tamilnadu sarkaar ke bhavishya ko lekar sabase zyada charchaa ho rahi he
 In the political circles of Tamil Nadu, there is a strong discussion about Jayalalithaa's successor
 inamen zyaadaatar logon kaa ishaara dakshin bhartiya abhinayta ajit kumaar kii taraf he
 Jayalalithaa's party AIADMK claims that Jayalalithane had chosen Ajit Kumar as his successor and the next Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu
 paneerselvam nahin honge ammaa ke uttaradhikari!kaha ja rahaa he ki uttaradhikari ko lekar yah faisla jayalalita kii vasiyat main likhaa hua he or is vasiyat se jayalalita ke behad bharosmand sahyogi acchhee tarah avgat bhi he
 Earlier, in the corruption case, when Jayalalithaa had to leave the chair of CM, Panneerselvam was given charge of the post of CM, but there is absolutely no possibility of Panneerselvam as Jayalalithaa's successor
 AIADMK kaaryakartaaon main lokapriy hai ajit68 saal kii jayalalita chaahati hai ki unka uttaradhikari aisa shaks ho jisamen logon ko apni ore khinchne kii quality ho or uske bheetar majboot netritv kii kshamta ho
 In such a situation, the AIADMK is not sure about Panneerselvam
 actor ajit bhi jayalalita se kareebi ko icchhuk dikhe hai
 Party workers also like Ajit
 ajit ko siyasat kaa anubhav nahilekin, ajit ko lekar sabase badi dikkat yah he ki unhen siyasat kaa koi anubhav nahin he
 In such a situation, it will be very difficult to hand him over to the post of Chief Minister of the state
 is tarah ek vikalp yah bhi he ki ajit kumaar ke siem pad kaa charge lene tak paneerselvam hi mukhyamantri kii jimmedaari nibhaaen
 At present, in the absence of Jayalalithaa, cm's advisor Sheela Balakrishnan is taking decisions related to governance and administration and giving instructions to the officers
 ediemke kii mukhiya jayalalita ne somvaar dopaher ko tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri pad kii shapath le lee
 Jayalalithaa has taken over as the Chief Minister for the third time in the state
 rajyapal surajeet singh barnaala ne jayalalita ko mukhyamantri pad kii shapath dilaai
 33 other ministers were also sworn in along with Jayalalithaa
 in mantriyon main 25 nae chehre hai
 The swearing-in ceremony was attended by a large crowd, including several dignitaries
 samaaroh main gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra mohan, andhra pradesh ke purv siem chandrababu naidu or sipiai mahasachiv abi vardhan maujuud rahe
 Jayalalithaa took the oath of office and secrecy in the Centenary Auditorium of the historic Madras University
 varsh 1991 se 1996 or phir 2001 se 2006 tak tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri raheen jayalalita kaa yah teesraa kaarykaal he
 This time Jayalalitha took special care of planetary conditions so that the government could run smoothly
 vaise to 16 may ko dopaher sava baarah baje kaa vakt shapath grahan ke liye chunaa gaya tha, lekin rajyapal ke der se pahunchane se kaarykram main vilamb hua
 The time of 63-year-old Jayalalithaa chose to take oath, the connection of astrology is being seen behind it
 jyotishiyon ke mutabik subah saadhe saat se nau baje rahu kaal he or saadhe das se dopaher baarah baje yama gand he
 Both of these times are not considered auspicious for new work
 gauratlab he ki karunanidhi ke ulat jayalalita bhagwaan or jyotish par gahari aasthaa rakhti hai
 According to astrologers, the next three years are fantastic for Jayalalithaa
 karunanidhi shashan main banaae gaye nae sachivalay ke bajaae jayalalita saint jorge fort se sarkaar chalaaengi
 St
 George's Fort was converted into a Central Classical Tamil Library by Karunanidhi, but it is being given a secretariat as soon as Jayalalithaa wins

 somvaar se world tii20 ke super 10 daur ke muqablon kaa aagaaj ho rahaa he
 Big teams will clash with each other in this round
 bade-bade sitaron se bhari tiimon kii ye takkar hameshaa hi dekhne laayak hoti he
 But when it comes to big tournaments like World T20, it gets a different color
 WT20 ke paanch bade sitareis world tii20 ke mahamucablon ke shuru hone se pehle ham aapako bataate hai un paanch dhurandharon ke bare main jin par har kisi kii nigaah he
 Everyone wants to see how they perform in this tournament
 kai baar ye apni parformens se apni team ko haar ke munh se khinchakar jita dete hai to kai baar team ko inke naa chalane kaa khamiyaja bhi bhugatna padataa he
 So let us tell you who are the five men in this World T20
 1-'chejadown king' viraat kohlikoi inhen aglaa sachin tendulkar kahata he to kisi ke liye ye duniya ke sabase achche batsman hai
 Virat Kohli has also forced the opposition to praise him for his consistent performance since his debut in Team India
 khaastaur se lakshya kaa peechha karte vakt to jaise kohli main koi superpavar aa jaati he
 Kohli does not leave the crease without winning the team or bringing him close to victory
 maidan main apane khel ke saath hi ye apane atitude ke liye bhi jane jate hai
 Many a times it happens that along with the bat, their body language also leaves no stone unturned in the downplay of the opposition players
 kohli ne apane pichley saat tii20 maichon main chaar ardhashatak jade hai
 If their form continues, they alone can make Team India a world champion
 2-'speed-swing' kaa badshaah mohammad aamirsirf 18 saal kii umr main spot phixing ke aarope main paanch saal kaa bain lagane ke baad kisi bhi yuva khilaadi ke liye vaapasi aasaan nahin hoti
 But Mohammad Aamir made a tremendous comeback and showed that if you work hard for something, you achieve it
 aamir kii safalataa ko agar tallent or kadi mehnat kaa mishran kaha jaae to galat nahin hota
 At the age of just 18, it is not easy for a senior team to get 51 wickets in 14 Tests
 apni vaapasi ke baad aamir ne khud par lage bain kii charchaa kar rahe logon ko apni bowling par charchaa karne ke liye majaboor kar diya
 If Aamir is able to maintain his form in the Asia Cup here, then overcoming them will be a big task for the opposition teams
 3-'captain' steve varsetyle smithchoti umr main hi australia jaisi team kii captaini sanbhaalane vaale steve smith jab krij par utarate hai
 So let's think that today we will consider bowlers and fielders only by being tired
 smith kii sabase badi khaasiyat team kii jarurat ke hisaab se apni batting kaa gear badal lenaa he
 They break on the bowlers when they want to and when they feel like they put a peg on the crease
 smith ko bhartiya bowling or bhartiya pichen kuch zyada hi raas aati hai
 This time World T20 is happening in India, so all teams need to be careful with this dangerous Versatile batsman
 varna smith kisi bhi pal match kaa pansaa palat sakate hai
 4-sri Lanka's 'angel', Angelo Mathews Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews is known for taking wickets at the time of need and landing the ball at the crease to show the boundary of the four corners of the field
 maithyuj gend or balle donon ke saath jabardast rup se khatarnaak hai
 Whether taking wickets in death overs or scoring runs in slog overs at a strike rate of 150-200, Mathews is the master of both
 maithyuj ne ipel main kaaphi match khele hai jiskaa anubhav nishchit taur par unke kaam aayega
 Although this time Sri Lanka's team is going through a very bad phase, but if Mathews gets support at the other end, then he can win the match against any team
 5-joseph edward root urf, jo 'ranmshin' rootjo root ko is list main naa lenaa jo or cricketpremiyon donon ke saath anyaay hoga
 After entering the English team once, Root caught his car succeeding that every speedbreaker on the way was crushed
 mahaj 25 saal ke is ballebaaj ne cricket ke teenon formet main jamkar ran barasaaye hai
 Root has won England on his own several times
 agar root kaa balla world tii20 main chal niklaa, to duniya kaa koi bhi gendbaaji akraman unhen roak nahin paaegaa
 Root does not have much experience of T20 International but he has scored 345 runs in 12 innings of 14 T20 Internationals played in 12 innings so far with an average of over 34 and a strike rate of over 133
 aapaki praathamiktaaon kii suchi main bhale hi ghar khareednaa sabase upar ho, lekin kya abhi aapke liye makaan khareednaa munasib he yaa nahin
 
 
 The This decision needs to be taken thoughtfully, and before that, it is important that humans check their needs, their financial condition, property prices and rent in the city, all these aspects
 ghar kharidne kaa sapana to sabhi dekhte hai, lekin ek madhyam varg ke profeshnal ke liye jis shahar main vah kaam karata he, vahaan rahane ke liye makaan khareednaa hameshaa phaayde kaa sauda nahin hota
 Given the difference between property prices and fares, especially in cities, sometimes it makes more sense to stay on rent, although traditionally buying a property has always been considered a profitable deal
 bajaj capital limited ke managing diarector sanjeev bajaj maanate hai ki vaise to ghar kharidne par aap acha nivesh hi kar rahe hai, lekin usee sthiti main, jab aapke paas uskaa down pement dene ke liye nakad ho or saath hi aap us shahar main lambey vakt tak rahane kii soch rakhte hon
 But also see that the rental amount in the city is against the property prices
 lekin is sabake baavjood kabhi-kabhi makaan kiraaye par lenaa hi aapke liye behatar hota he
 
 
 Especially for those who do not want to settle in the city or who are transferred frequently
 kiraaye par rahane kaa phayda yah he ki aap apni simit aay main bhi apni jeevanstyli ke mutabik makaan le sakate hai, jo vaise aapke bajet ke baahar ho
 If we look at some cities, the reason for living and buying in them becomes clear
 financial planning portal www
 arthyantra
 com ke mutabik bengaluru jaise shahar main, jahaan deshbhar se aae naukareepesha logon kii taadaad zyaada he, pichley teen saalon main kiraaye lagbhag 38 fisadi bade hai, jabaki property kii keemten lagbhag 13 fisadi
 
 
 In such a situation, only those with salary above 15 lakhs should think about buying property here
 vaise hi chennai main pichley teen saalon main property kii keemton main giravat ai he, lekin kiraaye 10 fisadi kii dar se bade hai
 
 
 Here, it would be better to buy a house for professionals with a salary of more than 20 lakhs
 dilli ensiaar main kiraayon main haalanki kaaphi badhat hui he, lekin dilli main property kii keemten desh main duusare number par hai
 In such a situation, it is better to stay here on rent
 mumbai kiraaye par rahane or kharidne, donon hi lihaaz se sabase mahangi nagari he
 But despite the expensive fares, it is prudent to stay here on rent
 www
 arthyantra
 com ke sansthaapak or siio nitin vyakaranam ke mutabik aankh mundakar makaan kharidne main samajhadaari nahin he, or usase pehle apane shahar or apni aarthik haalat kaa puraa gauge lenaa behad zaruri he
 Before buying a house, take a good review of your needs and financial condition before taking such a big loan, because this decision will continue to affect your financial condition for a long time

 The controversy over James Anderson's alleged clash with Ravindra Jadeja erupted again on Wednesday
 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne james anderson ko aade haathon lete hue kaha, 'pehle test match ke dauraan anderson ne seemaa rekha todi thi or vyavhaar thik nahin tha
 Anderson is accused of abusing and pushing Jadeja while returning to the dressing room inside the pavilion at lunch on the second day of the Nottingham Test match
 dhoni ne england ke khilaaf guuruuvaar se shuru hone vaale duusare test match se pehle kaha, 'hamane kabhi aisa (jadeja ko apshabd kahana or dhakka dena) nahin kiya he
 Accept this truth
 'unhone kaha, 'jaise ki press conference main aap mujhase kade sawaal kar sakate ho
 To answer or not to answer them is my right but i cannot touch you
 yaa aap aakar mujhe chhu nahin sakate
 You can put your point in any way, but some things need to be followed and they should be followed
 'dhoni ne kaha, 'ham khel bhaavana or aisi chizon ke bare main bahut baaten karte hai or dishanirdesh bhi hai, jinka paalan karnaa jaruri hota he
 'some players in our team also violated the boundary line earlier
 aap aakraamak ho sakate ho, vaachaal ho sakate ho
 But some guidelines have been set and we should follow them
 'gauratlab he ki anderson par level teen ke aarope lagaaye gayi hai or agar isisi kii nyaayik samiti unhen doshi paati he, to vah bache hue chaar main se kam se kam do test match main nahin khel paaenge
 The ICC is yet to set a date for the hearing and Anderson is scheduled to play at Lord's on Thursday due to short time between the first two Tests
 dhoni se poocha gaya ki dhakka dene ke kaaran kya yah ghatana kaaphi gambhir he, unhone kaha, 'nishchit taur par ham aisa maanate hai
 When Dhoni was asked whether Jadeja should also be blamed for this incident
 ' unhone kaha, ‘'nahin, main aisa nahin maanata
 He said, 'jadeja did it well that there was no response from his side
 'yah kaaphi bad saktaa tha lekin mujhe lagata he ki vah bahut acchhee tarah se isse nibata
 We have to learn from this and move forward
 aakhir ham khel khel rahe hai or kai log hamen dekhte hai or hamaare upar kaaphi jimmedaari hoti he
 The Indian captain denied that Anderson had been specifically targeted
 england evam wales cricket board (isibi) apane khilaadi ke samarthan main khadaa he or lag rahaa he ki baaki bache test maichon or vanade shrinkhalaa main donon tiimon ke rishton main khatas dekhne ko milegi
 Dhoni said that he is not too worried about this aspect
 unhone kaha, 'main isko lekar chintit nahin hum
 Of course i will try to make sure that the rest of the series is played in the right spirit, but that does not mean that you become completely submissive and bend down
 ham chaahate hai ki khilaadi aakraamak rahe, kuch baaten kahen lekin mahatvapurn yah he ki vah simaaon kaa ulanghan nahin karen
 Meanwhile, on Thursday's match, Dhoni said, "we are playing at Lord's and we all know the importance of this ground
" ' dhoni ne hameshaa kii tarah team sangyojan ke bare main bataane se inkaar kar diya
 He said, 'I have not seen the wicket
 dekhnaa hoga ki vah kitna kadaa he or usamen kitni ghaas he
 Much depends on the weather as well

 parmaanu or belistic missile kaaryakramon ke chalate pyongyang sanyukt raashtra ke kai pratibandhon ko jhel rahaa he
 Its ambition is to build a rocket capable of carrying armaments to the US mainland
 america raashtrapati donald trump ne sankalp liya he ki aisa nahin hoga

 The film is currently in the post production stage and Shahrukh is once again in controversy
 media main khabaren ai hai ki shahrukh phir se pita banane ja rahe hai or ye baccha sarogesi ke jariye paidaa ho rahaa he
 The dispute arose when it was said that the child to be born is a son
 logon ne sawaal uthaae ki shahrukh ko garbh main pal rahe bachche ke ling ke bare main kaise pataa chalaa

 But Devgan felt that the Yash Raj banner was trying to book more and more theaters through bullying
 unhone relies se do hafte pehle compatishan kamishan of india ko khat likhaa or yashraj films kii shikaayat kii
 It has been alleged that the Yash Raj banner has lured the single screen theater to show that if they 'jab Tak Hai Jaan Dekheen', they will also get the popular film 'ek Tha Tiger' to be released after that
 kamishan ne devgan kii shikaayat khaarij kar di
 a month before the release of the Don-2 2011 film, the original Don's producer banner sent a legal notice to the producers of the sequel
 unhone kaha ki hamane sirf don kii rimek ke rhite die the
 The producer of Dawn 2 said that when the sequel to the original film was not made, what was the point of asking for its rights? magar asal panga centre sarkaar kii taraf se aayaa
 The Health Ministry sent a notification saying that the lead character of the film is smoking a lot
 isse logon main in buraaiyon kii taraf badhaava hoga
 So either such scenes should be removed
 yaa phir unhen dhundhala kiya jaae
 After this, the film's production minister met Ambika Soni, explained her point and dealt with the matter with a statutory warning at the beginning of the film
 raa van 2011sabase pehle charchaa main ai khub sari videshi or ek tamil film se plot chori ko lekar

 khan ne jaahir taur par ye aarope nakaare or kaha ki ye pehali aisi pehali film he, jisamen super hero ek parivaar ke bich rahata he
 Three days after its release, the film again came into limelight
 pakistan ke havers ne film kii site hack kar lee thi
 He said that we took this action against the Karachi Press Club site being hacked
 magar film kii sabase gambhir controvarsi thi isaki kahani kii chori ko lekar

 vah mumbai hoicourt gaye or kaha ki yaa to unhen credit mili yaa film ke profit main 10 fisadi kaa hissaa
 The court asked the film producer to deposit a guarantee of 1 crore
 maai nem ij khan 200914 agast 2009 ko apni film maai nem ij khan ke pramotion ke liye shahrukh america pahunche

 bakaul shahrukh unase phir ek duusare kamare main poochtacha kii gai, jo south asia ke logon se bharaa tha
 Many of them came to ask for autographs, but the officials were adamant on their process
 udhar, film relies se pehle shivasena bhi shahrukh se gussa gai
 Shah Rukh bought the Kolkata team in the IPL and he was angry at why Pakistani players were not being allowed to play in the league

 The chief organizer of the unit, Asma Zohra, said in a release here that the 'muslim Women (protection of Right to Marriage) Bill 2018' could break marriages rather than empower women and would directly hurt the family system and the institution of marriage

 gujarat main dharm badalane kii chahat rakhane waalon main hindu sabase aage hai
 The state government has revealed this by the number of applications received for conversion
 beete paanch saal main mili aise aavednon main lagbhag 94 fisadi hindu dharm maanane waalon ke hai
 Of the total 1,838 applications received by the state government from people of all religions in five years, 1,735 are from those who believe in Hinduism
 dharm badalane ke liye leni hoti he manzoorirajya main dharmantaran par lagaam lagane vaale kanoon gujarat dharm swatantraaa act ke tahat dharm badalane kii chaah rakhane vaale logon ko pehle jila prashasan se isaki ijaajat leni hoti he
 However, the state government has not yet passed more than half of the applications
 sirf 878 logon ko hi dharm parivartan kii manjuuri mili he
 In the last five years, in addition to 1,735 Hindus, 57 Muslims, 42 Christians and 4 Parsis have also applied to change their religion
 in saalon main sikh or baudhon se kisi ne bhi dharm badalane ke liye aavedan nahin kiya
 Experts say that favorite marriage is a big reason behind it
 kuch aavedak isliye dharm badalanaa chaahate hai, taaki ve apane jeevanasathi kaa dharm apana saken
 Where the applications came from, the government has received more applications than the proportion of Hindu population in the state
 zyaadaatar aavedan surat, rajkot, porbandar, ahmedabad, jamnagar or junagarh jilon se aae hai
 Two years ago, one such case came to light in Junagadh
 vahaan kareeb ek lakh dalit logon ne buddha dharm kii diksha lee thi
 All applications will not be approved According to the officials, the government will not include all applications in its records
 gujarat dalit sanghathan ke adhyaksh jayant maanaknia ne kaha ki agar sarkari aankadon main dharm parivartan ke liye aavedan karne vaale hinduon kii sankhya 1,735 he, to ye tay he ki sarkaar sabhi aavednon ko manjuuri nahin degi
 i claim that if the correct figures are released, the number of Hindus applying is about 50 thousand
 'isliye atake rah jate hai aavedanmanaknia ne bataaya ki dharm badalane ke liye aae aavednon ko ham ikattha kar sambandhit jila prashasan ke paas manjuuri ke liye bhejte hai
 Most of our workers do not follow this
 aise main aavedan sarkari offis main atake rah jate hai
 Changes due to dissatisfaction Former National Fellow of Dharmindian Council of Social Science Research, Ghanshyam Shah said that the question is, who among Hindus are those who want to change religion? i believe that Dalits have a feeling of dissatisfaction, due to which they want to convert
 jansankhya ke aankadon se saaf he ki khud ko hindu kehane vaale kuch log darasal dharm parivartan kar bane nae buddha the
 The VHP expressed its displeasure: The general secretary of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Chhodhar Bharwad, said that the process of conversion was an anti-national activity

 Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi is going on a three-day visit from Monday
 is baat kii soochna pakistani videsh karyaalay ne di jisamen kuraishi ke pakistan-china videsh mantriyon ke ranneetik vaarta ke liye 17 se 20 march tak china kaa daure kii jaankaree di gai
 It is being told that during Qureshi's three-day official visit to China, he will attend the first strategic talks of islamabad-beijing foreign ministers
 pakistan ke akhbaar 'don' kii report ke anusaar donon paksh china-pakistan aarthik galiyare (sipiisi) sahit dwipaksheeya sambandhon par vyapak charchaa karenge
 Also, the regional situation and cooperation between the two countries will also be discussed
 kuraishi sipiisi par raajnneetik dalon kii sangoshtee ko sambodhit karenge or pakistan taharik-e-insaaf (pitiai) or china kii communist party ke bich samvaad main bhaag lenge
 He will also call on the Chinese leadership
 pakistan kii sarkaar ke bayaan ke anusaar, kuraishi kaa daura nikat or vyapak dwipaksheeya sambandhon main teji laaegaa or sipiisi ke tahat aarthik sambandhon ko gaharaa karne ke prayaason ko majbootee degaa
 Let us know that the visit of the Foreign Minister of Pakistan is going on 13 March after the veto of Chinese sanctions against Pakistan's terrorist group jaish-e-mohammed (JEM) kingpin Masood Azhar
 china ne aatanki masood azhar par lagaaya vitogauratlab he ki kuch din pehle hi china ne jaish sargana masood azhar ko global aatanki ghoshit karne main chauthi baar china roda atakaya tha
 Where China vetoed the proposal to declare Masood Azhar a global terrorist, after which the proposal was canceled
 jiske baad aatanki masood ajahar ek baar phir vaishvik aatanki ghoshit hone se batch gaya
 India had lodged a strong objection to China's decision
 agar china prastaav kaa samarthan kar detaa to masood vaishvik aatanki kii list main shaamil ho jaataa
 a proposal to declare Masood Azhar as a global terrorist was brought under Resolution 1267 in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)
 lekin china ke 'vito' power kaa istemaal kiya jiske baad ye prastaav paas nahin ho sakaa
 China has done this 4 times in the last 10 years

 Who said what on the hanging of Afzal Guru? At the same time, BJP leader Yashwant Sinha also gave notice of discussion in the Lok Sabha by postponing the question hour on Pakistan's move
 sinha kaa kahana he ki pakistan ne afjal guru ke maamle par apni sansad main jo prastaav jari kiya he, vah hamen kisi bhi surat main manjuur nahin hoga or is maamle par sansad main charchaa kii jaani chahie
 He demanded a resolution against Pakistan
 pakistan kii neshnal assembly ne sansad par hamale ke doshi afjal guru ko faansee die jane par ek ninda prastaav paas kiya he
 The proposal was made by Maulama fazl-urrahman, the head of jamayat-e-ulema-e-islam, which was approved by the Pakistani Parliament
 isamen kaha gaya he ki afjal kii faansee ke baad jammu-kashmir ke halaat kaaphi kharaab ho gaye hai, saath hi tihaad jail main dafan afjal guru ke shav ko uske gharavaalon ko saunpane kii bhi maang kii gai he
 The special thing is that just two days before completing his five-year term, the National Assembly has passed this resolution

 And even if they accept a few things from both the parties and draft a new bill, then who will guarantee that this will be the same Lokpal bill as this country needs to fight corruption

 At the beginning of the public meeting in Hindaun city of Rajasthan, Modi said, 'today when we have all gathered here, then millions of families living on the eastern and southern coast of the country are facing a severe cyclone'
 PM Modi: i took latest update from officers
 i held a review meeting y'day

 rahul gandhi ke siyaasi kariyar main 2017 kaa saal bade badlaav ke saal ke taur par dekha jayega
 The country saw his new avatar — one that continuously conducts mass campaigns, goes ahead and remains active, is influential on social media and makes decisions with vigor
 saal ke ant tak unhone congress adhyaksh kii gaddi bhi sambhaal lee, jo vaise to tay hi thi par ve khud varshon se use taalte aa rahe the
 But this dramatic change began with a failed experiment
 2017 ke uttar pradesh vidhansabha ke chunaavon kii daud main rahul ne prashanth kishor ko apni party ke abhiyaan ke ranneetikaar ke taur par niyukt kiya tha
 Behind the Kishore curtains were the strategists of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and Nitish Kumar in the 2015 Bihar Assembly elections
 kai congressiyon ne kishor kii sevaayen lene ke rahul ke faisle kaa nakalchi kahkar majaak udaaya tha
 But Rahul ignored this and assured Kishore an open leeway to run the election campaign
 peshewar ranneetikaar kishor kaa makasad congress kii jeet pakki karnaa tha
 He brought basic ideas like making Priyanka Gandhi as the Chief Ministerial candidate
 party kii kamajoriyon kaa unhone berahami se vishleshan kiya—sanghathan bilkul post haalat main he, soshal media ikai bhaajapa ke pasang bhi nahin he or zyaadaatar hindu dharmanirpekshata par congress ke rukh ko muslim tushtikaran kaa jariya maanate hai
 Kishore's association with the Congress defeat in Uttar Pradesh broke up in a jolt, but Rahul did learn a lesson
 congress ke ek mahasachiv kehete hai, ''kishor ke saath rahul ko yah samaj main aayaa ki modi jiske liye jane jate hai, unhone apane bare main vah dharna kaise banaai
 He realized that the best way to counter Modi was to beat him in his own game
 ''uttar pradesh kii haar ke do maheenon ke bheetar rahul ne apni pasandida loksabhaa saansad divya spandana ko party kii soshal media ikai kaa adhyaksh bana diya
 On his own, he disregarded his precautionary views on Twitter and started tweeting one after the other tweets that were full of humor and deep understanding while attacking the Modi government
 rahul ke dakratar ke ek sadsy kehete hai, ''unhen twitor par aane ke liye hamen bahut zyada manaanaa padaa, par ab unhen isamen majaa aa rahaa he or apane twit ve khud likhte hai
 "he also says," When some media channels criticized him for watching the film after the Gujarat elections, he tweeted very well, "if the BJP had the franchise of the film, it would have been called Lai Hard
" 
 ''uttar pradesh se rahul ne jo sabase bada sabak siikhaa, vah tha dhruvikaran kii takat or yah ki hindu voton ko golband karne main bhaajapa kaise kaamyaab rahi
 a Rajya Sabha member of the Congress says, "shwes still believe in secularism, but the need is to convince the people that the BJP is not the only Hindu guarding party
" '' isliye muslim vot bank ke nuksaan kii keemat par bhi congress adhyaksh gujarat ke chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan 27 mandiron main gaye or masjidon main jaakar palada baraabar karne kii unhone koi koshish nahin kii
 And to show that it was not full of election tricks, he went back to the Somnath temple after the elections
 jabardast dhruvon main bante chunavi maahaul main khud ko shiv bhakt bataane vaale rahul ke liye dharm ab nijee maamla nahin rah gaya he
 This practical approach is a new aspect of Rahul's politics
 abhi tak unki siyasat ko khud unheen kii party ke log 'enjio tip' qaraar dete rahe the
 It was this practical approach that took him to the American University in September, which became the launch pad of his new political figure
 us yatra kaa makasad haalanki chande ke liye videshon main rah rahe hindustaniyon tak pahunchnaa tha
 "congress is a poor party of rich leaders," says a prominent Haryana leader
 party ke kuch purv mukhyamantri or kendriya mantri puure loksabhaa chunaav kaa kharchaa uthaa sakate hai
 But if you look at our treasury, we do not even have the money to raise the basic expenses of the election of our candidates
 ''janvari 2018 main dubai kii yatra philhal sthagit kar di gai he, jo zyada rakam ugaahne ke makasad se hi tay kii gai thi
 The public perception management may have won the party a 'moral victory' in the Gujarat elections and an edge on social media, but Rahul knows that the fight against the BJP cannot be won without strengthening the party's organization and treasury
 2017 kaa saal is safar kii shuruyaat bhar tha

 On the lines of the Sangh in Uttar Pradesh elections, now BJP will also recruit full-time workers till the election

 BJP wants young and unmarried people to be given the responsibility of one assembly so that they can focus their attention in the elections
 The responsibility of these full-time people will be 1-1
 The management of the Assembly will not be like a pracharak of the Sangh but they will be full timers
 
 ye phulatimer apane ghar kaa rukh nahin karenge or ye bijepi kii wo force hogi jo har vidhansabha ke data se las hogi
 Who will have knowledge of every booth level and will work as a bridge and dialogue between the party and the organization
 pehle batch main 300 log hongabjapi sutron ke mutabik pehle batch main kul 300 ke kareeb aise purnakalik log honge jinhen bijepi chunaav main lagane ja rahi he in tamaam logon ko bijepi ne sangh ke anuvaanshik sanghathanon se maanga he inaki ek list bhi taiyaar ho rahi he jisane aise log honge jo apana puraa vakt party ko dene ko taiyaar hon
 BJP leaders are denying any such list, but they definitely believe that to win this election, everyone must work full time

 uttar pradesh vikaas samvaad ke naam se is sanghathan ne kai praanton main apni baithak shuru kar di he jisamen yuva vikaas samvaad ke jariye yuvaaon ko jodne kii koshish ho rahi he
 This is a do-or-die election for the BJP, in such a situation, the party wants to take every ploy so that it does not feel sorry about the election
 chunaav tak purnakaalikon kii bhartee upi main bijepi kaa nayaa prayog he ab dekhnaa yah he kya yah prayog bijepi ko satta tak pahunchaa paata he ki nahin
 Recently, in a meeting of Sangh pracharaks in Kanpur, BJP was officially kept away from it, but there was a discussion about this formula of BJP
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki sangh ne uttar pradesh chunaav main apane swayan sevakon ko bhi lagane kii hari jhandi de di he or ye chunaav aghoshit taur par sangh ke dekharekh main hi hoga
 The Congress, which is preparing for the Lok Sabha elections and the assembly to be held in other states including Chhattisgarh, has stepped up the campaign against the Modi government and the BJP
 ab congress ne bijepi ke vikaas model par nae andaaj main chutili prahaar kiya he
 Also, as the opposition party in Chhattisgarh, the Congress has launched a T-shirt war against the development model of the BJP government
 congress party apane kaaryakartaaon ko ek lakh tii-shart baantne ja rahi he or kareeb 35 lakh tii-shart kaa order diya he, jisamen 'ud gai vikaas kii chidiya' naaraa likhaa hua he
 It is considered to be a bevy of development models introduced by the BJP in elections
 iske jariye congress party ne bijepi par chutki bhi lee he
 These T-shirts mocking the bjp's development model are seen wearing by Congress party workers in Chhattisgarh
 congress kii in safed tii-shart ko pile or kaale rang se dizin kiya gaya he, jo aam logon kaa dhyaan apni ore aakarshith kar rahi hai
 Be it passersby in crowded areas, or people present in the vicinity of these activists, they are seen reading the message written in T-shirt very carefully
 chhattisgarhmen is saal ke aakhri main vidhansabha chunaav hone vaale hai
 Against the ruling BJP of the state, the Congress is running an anti-combancy campaign under the name 'vikas Ki Chidi'
 chhattisgarh main bijepi ke khilaaf congress kaa yah abhiyaan safal bhi ho rahaa he
 In Chhattisgarh, Congress workers are seen wearing T-shirts with the slogan 'udai Gayi Vikas Ki Chidiya' at public places like tea stalls, paan shops and restaurants
 congress par palatwaar karne kaa mauka dhudh rahibijepike liye ye tii-shart mushkil ban gai hai
 The slogan written on these T-shirts is on the line of Congress attacking BJP
 vahiin, bijepi ne agle saal hone vaale chunaavon ko lekar vyapak str par abhiyaan shuru kiya he
 Regarding this, BJP President Amit Shah has been holding rallies continuously in many states
 35 lakh tii-shart kaa diya orderchhattisgarh main congress 'ud gai vikaas kii chidiya' naaraa likhi ek lakh tii-shart apane kaaryakartaon main baantne ja rahi he
 Also, in view of the assembly elections to be held in the state, about 35 lakh T-shirts of this kind have been ordered
 aane vaale kuch maheenon main aisi tii-shart congressi kaaryakartaaon ke alaava congress ke samarthak matadaataaon tak pahunchane kii bhi taiyaari he
 At the same time, seeing this T-shirt, the BJP is shrinking its nose and ears
 party kii daleel he ki satta paane ke liye congress ochhi harkaton par utar ai he
 He does not see development in every village of the state
 congress ne vikaas ke kaamon ko nakarah bijepiti-shart pahanakar yahaan-vahaan chahalkadami karne vaale NSUI ke pradesh adhyaksh akaash kaa kahana he ki jab kabhi bhi wo yah tii-shart pahanakar ghar se baahar nikalate he, to unhen rahgeer bade gaur se dekhte he
 Many seem eager to discuss them in the matter of development
 udhar, bijepi pravaktaa shrichand sundarani ise congress kii ghatiya soch bataate he
 According to him, the Congress has rejected even development works in the pursuit of cheap popularity
 aise main janata bhi use chauthi baar nakaarne vaali he
 BJP will enter election season regarding development work, BJP in Chhattisgarh has made development work in 15 years of its term an issue
 bijepi vikaas ke mudde ko lekar chunavi maidan main utari he
 From the cities to the rural areas and from the villages to the streets, the BJP has described the construction work done in these 15 years as its achievement
 bijepi mukhya rup se vikaas ke mudde par logon kaa dhyaan khinch rahi he
 So the Congress has warped the T-shirt to break it
 haalanki ise lekar mukhyamantri raman singh bhi congress par palatwaar kar rahe hai
 As the assembly elections in Chhattisgarh come to a close, other parties including BJP and Congress are trying new tricks to attack each other

 bhartiya team ke captain viraat kohli kaa maananaa he ki dakshin africa daure par nattejey apane paksh main karne ke liye team ke khilaadiyon ko akramak ravaiya apnaanaa hoga
 In the second Test against Sri Lanka on Monday, playing a vigorous innings of 213 runs in 267 balls, the team took the team to a big score
 kohli ke dohare shatak or murali vijay, cheteshwar pujaar tathaa rohit sharma ke shatakon ke dam par bharat ne vishaal score khadaa karne ke baad yah sunishchit kiya ki gendbaajon ke paas srilanka ko ol out karne kaa puraa samay ho
 India won the match with a big margin of innings and 239 runs
 'main apni style main ballebaaji karnaa chahta tha'match ke baad kohli ne kaha, ‘main apni style main ballebaaji karnaa chahta tha
 i wanted to give the bowlers full time by scoring fast runs, so that they could cover Sri Lanka's innings
 ’ bhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘hamen videshon main aise bhi aisa rukh akhriyaar karnaa hoga, isliye main yahaan aisa karnaa chahataa tha
 i always want to improve my performance by scoring big centuries, so that the team can benefit from it
 ''fitness kii vajah se lambii pari khel paaya'viraat ne kaha, 'shatak banane ke baad jab aap ekaagratha khote he to ek-do wicket jaldi gir sakate he
 i think of the way that a batsman sitting at the crease can play shots more easily than a new batsman and my fitness helped in playing long innings
 ' cheteshwar pujaara lambey samay se team ke liye test maichon main lagaataar acha pradarshan kar rahe hai, lekin vijay or rohit ke form main lautne se kohli ke paas team chayan ko lekar duvidha kii sthit acchhee baat he
 Murali Vijay does not respond - Kohlikohli said, 'we all know Pujara performs continuously
 vijay kuch samay ke baad khel rahe the, unhen bhartiya team kaa pratinidhitiv karne par fakr hota he
 i know he will be sad to be out of the team and he made a great comeback
 rohit ne bhavishya ke liye apana daawa majboot kiya
 Whenever we talk about team combination, he will be a part of it
 aanevaale samay main hamen bahut saare test maichon main khelnaa he
 "no time to prepare for the tour of South Africa" virat also praised the bowlers, especially the fast bowlers
 unhone kaha, ‘pichley kuch maheene main bhubaneshwar kumaar ne bharat ke liye bahut saare match khele hai
 Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav have not played much international cricket
 lekin gharelu pratham shrenee maichon main unhone kaaphi gendbaaji kii he or ve hameshaa kehete hai ki lay main rahane ke liye yah jaruri he
 He also bowled amazing on this pitch, although the spinners did a good job, Ishant was an amazing bowler for us
 ’ shandaar pari ke liye main of match bane kohli ne kaha ki team srilanka ke khilaaf siries ko dakshin africa kii taiyaariyon ke taur par le rahi kyonki unke paas samay nahin he
 South Africa tour will be difficult - Kohli tour of South Africa will not be easy for Indian team
 kohli ne kaha ki ‘hamaara maananaa he ki hamen dakshin africa daure kii taiyaari kerani he
 So we asked to create a pitch that helps the fast bowlers
 lekin is (nagpur) pich duusare din ke baad se tej gendbaajo ke liye zyada kuch nahin tha
 We got the ideal wicket in Kolkata
 ' bhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘ hamaare paas daure kii taiyaariyon ke liye zyada samay nahin he, isliye jo samay he usee ko dakshin africa daure kii taiyaariyon ke liye istemaal karnaa he
 On this occasion, when Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal was asked about the poor performance of the team, he found a lack of words
 unhone ballebaajon par dosha madhte hue kaha ki bharat jaisi team ke saath acha karne ke liye unhen pehali pari main bada score karnaa hoga
 He said, 'it was good for us to win the toss
 durbhaagya se ve match ke pehle din se hi ham par haaavee rahe
 Our batting unit disappointed us
 hamen bharat ke khilaaf jeetne yaa paanch dinon tak match main bane rahane ke liye kam se kam 350 ran banane honge
 Lankan batsmen could not stand big scores, Sri Lankan captain said, 'we came here with strategy
 hamane khilaadiyon ko kaha tha ki agar aapako shuruuaat milti he to use badi pari main badalanaa hoga lekin unhone sirf 50-60 ran banaae or out ho gaye
 It was unfortunate but i am sure they will learn from it
 ' chandimal ne kaha ki angelo maithyuj jaise varisht khilaadiyon ko apana str ooncha kar yuva khilaadiyon ke liye udhaaharan bananaa hoga
 He said, 'angelo is the most senior player on the team and if he does not score then the team is at a disadvantage
 varisht khilaadi ke taur par aapako pradarshan karnaa hoga taaki yuva uskaa anusaran kar saken
 i am sure they will do well

 log in hamaari naukarshahi main sudhaar ke mudde par charchaa kisi nattejey par nahin pahunch paati, kyonki yah charchaa saralatam manyataon par tiki hoti he
 Ironically, much of the attention in the discussion is on excessive red tape, in which corruption is the main issue, but the issue of efficiency is not given much attention
 or ek bhram yah he ki sudhaar kaa matlab he kuch nae niyam bana dena, zyada nigaraanee rakhana, nae sansthagat dizin taiyaar karnaa or kaam ke badale protsaahan dena
 But this is only a small part of this story
 isamen is baat ko nazarandaaj kar diya jaataa he ki zyada nigaraanee se vyavastha kii kaaryakshmata ghat jaati he
 Such a notion also forgets how bureaucratic conduct is embedded in the socio-economic structure
 pehla, vikaas or naukarshahi main sudhaar ke bich kaa sambandh kaaphi jatil he
 It is no coincidence that per capita GDP (gross domestic product-gdp) of all countries ranked above India is also above
 isse hamen kya pataa chalata he, kami kahaan rah rahi he
 We need to think both ways
 aam dharna ke vipareet, bharat apane rajya par paryaapt kharch nahin karata
 India's spending on its own state structure is very low on any criteria of capacity and compared to any international
 vibhaag dar vibhaag, nyaaypalika se lekar sankhyikeevidon, khaadya nirikshakon se lekar nagar ke yojanakaaron tak sabhi kii kshamta bahut kam he
 a financial estimate of spending is usually associated with all laws
 lekin ham kabhi bhi nai jimmedaariyaan thopane ke prashasnic nateezon ke bare main sawaal tak nahin karte
 While we cry a lot of staff strength in most departments, the reality is that the Indian state is short of staff, lacks resources and lacks adequate training
 is vidambnaa kaa chithran bahucharchit upanyaas raag darbari main bakhubi kiya gaya he
 Sometimes the work load is so high that all the work is stopped
 vikaas se kuch aise sansaadhan paidaa hote hai, jinke bal par rajya apni kshamta ke nirmaan main kharch kar saktaa he
 Second, the relationship between corruption and bureaucracy is also quite complex
 udhaaharan ke liye dekhen to bihar or orissa kii samasya yah nahin he ki vahaan tamilnadu yaa andhra pradesh se zyada bhrashtachar he balki sachaai yah he ki garib rajyon main budhimaani se bhrasht hone ke avasar kam hai
 Most corruption is linked to schemes that are made for the poor, while in states such as Haryana or Tamil Nadu, the same money is raised from the real estate sector, telecommunications, roads, or new terminology, public-private partnerships
 sankshep main kahen to in rajyon main bhrashtachar aise kshetron se judaa hota he, jo garibon ko kam prabhavit karne vaale hote hai
 From the other side, it encourages political leaders to develop
 rajyon main or unki naukarshahi ke kaamkaaj main kaaphi antar he
 The major reason for this is the benefit to the politicians
 teesraa, bhartiya rajya ke saath ek vaastavik samasya he teen alag-alag raaston main iskaa saamaajik sthaan
 To be fair, access to the power of power is seen as a means of social mobilization and thus it legitimizes every use of power
 duusari baat, yahaan ke padanukram vaale samaaj main satta kii takat kaa aakarshan bahut bad jaataa he, kyonki yah aapako duusare se zyada taqatvar banane kaa avasar detaa he
 When you do something for a person using the power of power, you get an inner happiness
 lekin aapke andar yah bhaavana nahin aati ki aap kisi ko kuch de rahe hai to kuch le bhi rahe hai
 Thirdly, the social hierarchy within the state makes one person smaller or larger than another
 duniya main aisa kahaan he, jahaan jatiyon kii tarah ke puraane rivaaj chal rahe hai ki koun kiski maujuudagi main kursi par baith saktaa he
 How can you expect a lower level officer to behave on a par with others when he has not experienced it himself
 aisa kab hua he jab nichle str ke adhikari ko khud faisle karne kaa adhikaar diya gaya ho
 Then it is no wonder that he knows the rules, but he has no idea about the goals of the state
 iees ko taiyaar karne par to puraa dhyaan diya jaataa he, lekin nichle str ke adhikariyon ko peshewar hone kii pahchaan dene par bilkul hi dhyaan nahin diya jaataa
 a thorough study on America's anti-corruption measures, The Pursuit of Absolute Integrity, suggests that the feeling of being a professional is far more effective in bringing about productivity and honesty than good rules and encouragement
 rajya kii naukarshahi main sudhaar laane ke liye saamaajik kranti kii jarurat he
 The problem with bureaucracy, especially in the case of IAS, is not a lack of ideas
 naukarshahi ke prashikshan ke liye ek asana sujhav is tarah haih unhen kaaryakramon ko samajhne ke liye videshon main na bhejein, balki madhyakaalin shaskaon se prerana len
 Ask them to run an NGO as a common citizen, to start a small business, to apply for a passport on their own and ask them to make rules after their experiences
 iees ke prashikshan main amoortata hi zyada he, jabaki vyaavhaarikta bahut kam
 Fourthly, there is a reason why there is very less emphasis on state reforms
 saaf kahen to bharat main bade kaarobaar ke liye kuch bhi mushkil nahin he
 He has the resources to use the system in his own way and can afford government regulations while small businesses face all the difficulties
 lekin nateeja yah he ki naukarshahi main vaastavik sudhaar ke liye bada kaarobaar kabhi bhi gambhir lobby nahin rahaa
 It is lobbying only to get discounts for itself
 isane kabhi bhi sarkaar par naukarshahi main sudhaar ke liye samuhik dabaav nahin daalaa
 And then it is very important to have ideological clarity in the state
 jab tak rajnatik spashtataa nahin hogi tab tak naukarshahi main prabhavi sudhaar nahin ho saktaa
 The problem has never been that bureaucrats spoil the politicians, which the political says so, is shirking from his responsibility
 samasya tab hoti he jab raajnneetik naukarshahon ke kandhon par bandook rakhkar nishaanaa sadhana chaahate hanore iske badale main naukarshah aatmaraksha kii ek vyavastha bana lete hai
 The nature of bureaucracy is that it has no decision of its own, that is why all responsibility falls on the political section
 sankshep main kahen to ek acchhee naukarshahi ke liye aapako ek spasht rajnatik netritv kii jarurat hoti he
 The bureaucracy considers the goals as means, the rules as the result and control as efficiency, as we often do not ask the question of who the state is for
 rajya ko betaratibi se jitna adhik kaam diya jaataa he, utani hi isaki praathamiktaaon or kaam main gadabadi hoti he
 If the question of goals is not clear, then there will be more confusion at the level at which decisions are taken
 ham aaj bhi duniya main sabase zyada kendrikrut rajyon main se ek hai
 If we really want to improve bureaucracy and society seriously then we have to question the allocation of power in our state and society

 is duniya kaa sabase bada aatankwaadi aurais kaa supreme commander abu bakar al bagdadi maaraa gaya
 Radio Iran has confirmed this by quoting from its sources and this is the biggest success of Radio Iran's claim in this war, in which dozens of countries of the world spent hundreds of billions of rupees in nearly 11 months
 Has lost his life ye or baat he ki khud iesas ke dushman mulkon ke paas philhal is khabar kii pushti kaa koi rasta nahin he
 The killer of thousands of innocents, the worst casualty, the biggest enemy of humanity, and the most wanted in many countries including America, on which about 6
 5 karod rupayon kaa inam tha wo maaraa gaya
 Baghdadi was also the Chief of ISIS and the self-proclaimed Khalifa of Islamic State militants
 bagdadi kii maut america kii aguwai main iraq par jari colision deshon ke us hawaii hamale main hui, jisamen bagdadi pichley maheene kii 18 taarikh ko tab buree tarah jakhmi ho gaya tha, jab wo apane aatankwaadiyon kii ek toli ke saath iraq or syria border ke kareeb apane thikaane par laut rahaa tha
 Radio Iran confirmed this news for the first time on Tuesday amid reports of Baghdadi's injuries for nearly a month
 haalanki america samet tamaam mulkon ne abhi kisi thos subut ke saamne aane tak is khabar par apni muhar lagane se inkaar kar diya he, lekin radio iran ne jis tarah se apane sutron ke hawaale se is khabar ke khulaase kaa elaan kiya he, usase ye mana jane laga he ki ab shaayad bagdadi kii maut ho chuki he
 According to Radio Iran, Baghdadi died in an Israeli hospital in the Golan Heights area of syria, where he was being treated by an Israeli doctor and has now made it clear that Baghdadi is no longer alive
 radio iran ne do iraqi news agenciyon algaad press or al-yum al-tamen ke hawaale se ye baat kahi he
 Earlier in the year 2014, he narrowly survived an attack, but this time his luck did not support him
 sutron ke mutabik ISIS ke ladaake use apane kabje vaale syria ke golan hits ilaake main ilaaj ke liye le gaye, haalanki ye badi hairat kii baat he ki uskaa ilaaj israeli aspataal main hua or israeli doctor uski timaardaari main lage rahe, jabaki isroyal to bagdadi kaa dushman number 1 or america kaa kareebi mana jaataa he
 On the other hand, sources are quoted to have said that the ISIS spokesperson has rejected the claims of Baghdadi's death
 iraq ke mosul main ISIS ke ek pravaktaa ne daawa kiya ki bagdadi bilkul sahi salaamat he or anbar ilaake main apni jang kii aguwai kar rahaa he
 However, after news of Baghdadi's injuries in the airstrikes, the discussion of the election of his successor in the second-third week of March also intensified
 is dauraan ek purv teacher abdul rahamaan al-sijalaar urf abu alaa aafri kaa naam ISIS ke nae leader ke taur par ubharkar saamne aayaa tha
