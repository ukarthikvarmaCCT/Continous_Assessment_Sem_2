 Samajwadi Party (SP) is not willing to contest elections in Uttar Pradesh along with Congress
 sapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ke kareebi sutron ke mutabik party saal 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav main uttar pradesh kii 80 siton main se congress ko sirf do siten hi dena chaahati he
 In this regard, Akhilesh Yadav is reaching Delhi on Tuesday to discuss with other parties of the alliance
 sutron kaa kahana he ki loksabhaa chunaav main samaajawaadee party sirf amethi or raibareli seat hi congress ko dena chaahati he
 The SP does not want to give more than one seat to the Congress
 is babat sapa congress ko prastaav bhi dene kii yojana bana rahi he
 SP sources say that the party wants a triangular contest in UP and is not keen on including Congress in the grand alliance
 mangalvaar ko dilli pahunchenge akhilesh yadavasutron ke mutabik mangalvaar ko akhilesh yadav dilli jaaenge or vahaan do se teen din tak rukenge
 It is believed that during this time Akhilesh Yadav will meet other leaders of the coalition separately
 do-teen din dilli main rukne ke baad akhilesh yadav parivaar ke saath chhuttiyaan manaane videsh jaaenge
 His visit to Delhi will be important for the alliance
 rahul kii iftaar party main nahin tha sapa kaa numaayindacongress or sapa main daraar kii khabaren us samay saamne ain, jab rahul gandhi kii iftaar party main na akhilesh yadav pahunche or na hi unki party kaa koi numaayinda
 However, Akhilesh Yadav also announced loudly to participate in the Iftar party
 iske baad se lagaataar sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya congress or samaajawaadee party ke bich sabakuch thik-thaak nahin chal rahaa he?sawaal ye bhi uth rahe hai ki kya sapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ko bahujan samaaj party (BSP) supremeo mayawati or congress kii kareebi raas nahin aa rahi he? kya purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav gathbandhan ke tahat siton ke bantwaare ko lekar bispi ke dabaav main hai
 It is being told that the Samajwadi Party holds the Congress responsible for the crushing defeat in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 lihaaja samaajawaadee party aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko zyada bhav dene ke mood main nahin he
 At the same time, the Samajwadi Party does not want to leave the BSP in any way after the victory in the by-elections
 akhilesh yadav to yahaan tak elaan kar chuke hai ki wo basapa ke saath gathbandhan ke liye junior partner banane or kuch siten chhodane tak ko taiyaar hai
 Akhilesh is under pressure for an alliance with Mayawati
 It is being said that these days SP President Akhilesh Yadav is under lot of pressure with the alliance with BSP
 haalanki guuruuvaar ko kannauj se aae kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue akhilesh ne saaf kaha ki gathbandhan hoga or jald hoga
 The phase of speculation started with the absence of Iftar party
 The round of speculation started due to the absence of any representative of Samajwadi Party in Korahul Gandhi's Iftar party
 jis tareeke se mayawati or congress lagaataar najadik aa rahe hai, wo shaayad akhilesh yadav ko raas nahin aa rahi he
 The Samajwadi Party itself saw the manner in which the body language and chemistry of the BSP and Congress leaders was seen in the swearing-in of Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy and then the Congress had serious discussions with the BSP in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh
 Has started feeling on edge
 yahi vajah he ki samaajawaadee party ne madhya pradesh kii sabhi siton par chunaav ladane kaa elaan kiya he
 The SP party does not want an alliance with the Congress in UP, and its leaders have also openly announced this
 gorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa up chunaavon main congress ke chunaav ladane ke baavjood samaajawaadee party ne na sirf siten jiti, balki congress kii jamaanat bhi jabt ho gai
 In such a situation, the SP no longer wants to compromise with the Congress in UP
 vahiin, duusari taraf bahujan samaaj party lagaataar congress se kareebi badhaati dikh rahi he or yahi samaajawaadee party ke liye philhal sabase bada saradard he
 The BSP did not open in the last Lok Sabha elections
 Account UP has a total of 80 parliamentary seats
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main modi lahar main bijepi gathbandhan ne 73 siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 The SP got five seats and the Congress two, while the bsp's account was also not opened
 isi tarah se pichley saal hue upi vidhansabha chunaav main sapa bhi basapa se zyada siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 Although both parties contested in these elections separately
 iske baad phulpur-gorakhpur upachunaav main sapa ko basapa ne samarthan diya tha
 As a result, the BJP suffered a crushing defeat
 iske baad se donon partiyaan ke bich rishte majboot hue hai
 This is the reason why Akhilesh Yadav is not ready to leave the BSP in any way
 mayawati lagaataar banaae hue hai dabaavakairana upachunaav ke pehlemayawatine sammanjanak siton ke nahin milane par gathbandhan nahin karne kaa elaan kiya tha or phir jis tareeke se akhilesh yadav ne uttar pradesh main junior partner banane par apni sahmati jataai thi, uske baad se lagane laga tha ki bispi se gathbandhan ko lekar akhilesh yadav kaaphi aatur hai, lekin mayawati philhal apni sadhe chaalon se akhilesh ko lagaataar dabaav main rakh rahi hai
 Declaration of lesser seats did not embrace SP activists There is a lot of buzz in the political corridors of Uttar Pradesh that all is not well between the SP and BSP alliance
 mayawati 40 se 44 siton se kam par chunaav nahin ladanaa chaahati hai, jabaki akhilesh yadav baraabar yaa 2-4 kam siton par raji ho sakate hai, lekin samasya sirf seat tak hi nahin he
 Mayawati can also go with the Congress
 At the same time, the Congress is looking at its future with Mayawati in Uttar Pradesh with the help of simple tricks
 aise main samaajawaadee party kii sabase badi chintaa yah he ki mayawati kahin zyada siton ke naam par congress ke saath na chali jaaen
 Sensing the same, Akhilesh Yadav had given his consent to become a junior partner in Mainpuri four days ago
 ek taraf bangala vivaad main akhilesh yadav kii saaf-suthri image ko dhakka laga he, to duusari ore mayawati or congress kii nazdikiyaan bhi akhilesh yadav ke liye acchhee khabar nahin he
 This is the reason why even after opening all its cards first, political pressure is clearly visible on Akhilesh Yadav
 is saal ke aakhir tak desh ke chaar rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai

 Please tell that Yogesh Varshney, the leader of bjp's youth wing in Aligarh, said that whoever beheads Mamata Banerjee will be given a reward of Rs 11 lakh
 varshney kaa ye bayaan aise vakt main aayaa tha jab pashchim bengal ke birbhum main hanuman jayanti ke maukey par nikaale gaye juluus par lathicharge kaa maamla surkhiyon main tha
 Without naming the BJP, Mamta said, 'I have been called abusive in many ways but i do not pay attention to it
 ye mere liye ashish kii tarah he
 The more he abuses me, the more we will prosper
 'mamata ne kaha, 'main sirf sarvashaktimaan se prarthana hi kar sakati hum ki unhen kshamaa kar den, wo nahin jaanate ki kya kar rahe hai
 They should ignore instead of giving any kind of attention
 ' mamata ne aagaah kiya ki raajnneeti main buniyadi garima banaae rakhni chahie
 In an administrative meeting in Murshidabad, the Trinamool Congress supremo said that politics is all about culture, dignity and humanity
 bengal main ramanavami or hanuman jayanti keyojanon ko lekar chhidi bahasake bich mamata ne bijepi par nishaanaa saadhane main koi kasar nahin chodi
 Mamta said, 'if they ask why i go to the dargah or temple, then i will go there a thousand times
 wo hai koun mujh se sawaal karne vaale
 'at a time when the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is demanding a ban on cow slaughter across the country, Mamata warned the BJP that she does not have the right to decide what to eat and what not
 mamata ne kaha, 'kya ye wo tay karenge kilog kya khaaenge
 Don't Adivasis and Christians eat this kind of meat
 yahaan tak ki kuch hindu bhi ye khate hai
 Just because a political party is in power, it does not get the right to decide such things
 ' Ram temple issue has now been entered in the Gujarat elections
 pehle bhartiya janata party adhyaksh amit shah ne ram mandir mudde par congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi par sawaal daage, ab pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi apni raily main is mudde ko uthaaya he
 Congress leader Anand Sharma has retaliated on Modi's statement
 unhone kaha ki piem jab bolte hai kadava hi bolte hai
 Anand Sharma said that when the Prime Minister speaks bitter, there is sweetness in the food of Gujarat, but Modi ji still speaks bitter
 unhone kaha ki piem ko bataanaa chahie ki ve kis agenda par chunaav lard rahe hai
 We have channeled them to debate on every issue, even if they choose the timing themselves
 anand sharma ne kaha ki piem hameshaa gandhi ji kaa udhaaharan dete hai, lekin gandhi ji satya kaa pratik the
 pms should follow their ideals
 unhone kaha ki jis tarah se bijepi netaaon ke bayaan aa rahe hai, usase saaf jaahir ho rahaa he ki bijepi chunaav haar rahi he
 What Modi said on Ram temple, let me tell you that on Tuesday, the Prime Minister addressed the rally in Dhandhuka
 yahaan unhone ram mandir ke mudde par kaha ki chunaav ke bich ab congress bhi khud ko ram mandir se jod rahi he, lekin unhen raashtra kii chintaa nahin he
 On hearing the temple issue in the Supreme Court, PM Modi said that yesterday Kapil Sibal was speaking on behalf of the parties of Babri Masjid, it is his business, not a complaint
 lekin kya unhen 2019 tak sunwaayee taalane kii maang kerani chahie, kya congress kii ore se ram mandir mudde ko chunaav tak taalane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Shah had also asked questions on this issue, on Tuesday, BJP national president Amit Shah had directly questioned Rahul Gandhi
 unhone poocha ki ram mandir ko lekar aapaki party or aapkaa kya stand he? ram mandir ke mudde par press conference karte hue amit shah ne kaha ki bijepi chaahati he ki jald se is mudde par supreme court main sunwaayee ho or faisla aae
 So that a grand temple of Lord Shri Ram can be built in Ayodhya, which is associated with the faith of the country
 mandir-mandir rahul to virodh kyon?bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha ki aakhirkaar ram mandir maamle kii sunwaayee rokane se kya hasil hone vaala he
 He said that the Congress party should clarify its stand on the hearing of Ram temple case
 unhone kaha ki ek taraf rahul gandhi gujarat main mandir ja rahe hai, to duusari taraf ram janmabhumi cese par sunwaayee ko taalane ke liye kapil sibbal kaa upyog kiya ja rahaa he
 The Congress Party should make its stand clear
 cricket main jab se no ball ke niyam badale hai tab se ballebaaj no ball ke baad vaali free hit gend par chaahe jaise bhi ho adhiktam ran banane kii koshish karata he
 Batsman does not miss playing reverse sweep, slog sweep and ramp shot to score on a free hit
 lekin hamaare test captain or vanade up-captain viraat kohli ne mirpur main jo kiya use dekhakar har koi bhounchakka rah gaya
 Taskin Ahmed was throwing the last ball of the fourth over during the second ODI at Mirpur
 taskin ne popping krij ko overstep kiya or ampire ne use no ball qaraar diya
 The next ball in front of Kohli was a golden opportunity to increase his team's run rate because in ODI cricket after a no ball, the bowler's next ball is presented to the batsmen as a free hit
 iskaa matlab he kibatsman is gend par cricket ke niyamonke tahat keval ran out ho saktaa he
 The batsman does not get out the other way, whether he is bowled or caught
 yani free hit gend kaa saamana kar rahe ek ballebaaj ke dimag main us gend par adhiktam score kaise kare bas yahi chalata hota he
 But here Virat played a defensive shot in the cover area and could not get a single run
 viraat ne aisa kyon kiya yah kisi kii samaj main nahin aayaa
 He may not have seen the umpire's no-ball gesture
 vah yah nahin jaanata ho ki phenki ja rahi ball free hit ke liye he
 But what can be expected from a serious cricketer like Kavi Virat? How can he be so careless as a batsman despite getting into the field that he could not even see or hear the gesture of no ball
 is ek shot se match ke nattejey par pratyaksh yaa paroksh koi asar padataa yaa nahin yah kahana bahut mushkil he lekin isaki vajah se unke prashansak to nishchit taur par aahat hue honge
 Even the commentators of the match were surprised by this shot of Virat
 tabakohali 8 gendon par keval 7 bana kar khelrahe the or team kaa score 1 wicket ke nuksaan par 21 ran tha
 If Kohli tried to hit a four or a six on this ball, the run rate would surely have benefited and at the same time the pressure on the Bangladeshi bowlers and fielders
 kohli aakhir main 23 ran banaakar pavilion laut gaye or team india 200 ranon par ol out ho gai
 Bangladesh finally won the match by 6 wickets and won the ODI series against India for the first time
 barish se prabhavit yah match bangladesh ke liye jahaan aitihaasik sabit hua vahiin duusari ore viraat kohli ko lekar bhartiya cricket prashansakon ke dimag main ek sawaal to chhod hi gaya

 usne kaha ki ham shaadi ke liye tumhaare gharavaalon ko manaa lenge
 We were married in the temple on 25 May

 manpreet badal ne abhi haal hi main apni punjab pipuls party (pipipi) kaa congress main vilay kiya tha

 This post is Truth ie post facto or post facto era, where decisions and debates are not based on facts or evidence
 kya bharat main bhi satyottar yug aa gaya he?notebandi bharat kii pehali post fact yaa tathyottar ghatana maaloom hoti he
 The impact of demonetisation on job, business and employment is accepted by the factual documents of the government and renowned agencies (economic Review and Reserve Bank Assessment)
 notebandi se na baari kaala dhan niklaa, na sarkaar kaa khajaana bharaa, na koi bada bhrashtachari hathe chadha
 Even the success and failure figures of the government and the Reserve Bank of Demonetisation were quietly digested, but the rural and urban (odisha and Maharashtra) election results pushed the losses out of demonetisation
 logon ne tathy or tajurbon, donon ko nakaar bhaavnaatmak ummiido par faisla kiya or bhaajapa ko bharat kii pehali post truth vijay se vibhooshit kar diya
 The post-scripture chapter of demonetisation extends beyond elections to economic data
 rigerv bank, sarkaar kaa sankhyikee vibhaag, aarthik samiksha sabhi to maan rahe the ki notebandi mandi lekar ai he
 Private agencies and international institutions (imf-world Bank) have demonstrated deep economic losses from demonetisation based on fact and experience
 
 
 
 But the government said through data that in the note ban quarter (when the pockets were empty) people were spending more (consumption expenditure) than before
 companiyaan nayaa utpaadan karne ke liye nivesh badhaane main jutin thim
 The demand was so strong that import bulls were jumping
 sarkaar bhi khulkar kharch kar rahi thi
 That is, the months of demonetisation were the most spectacular months of the Indian economy
 tathy yah he ki tej growth dikhaane ke liye pichley saal ke aankade gata die gaye
 Sales of companies fell
 bank karj kii maang 60 saal ke sabase nichle str par thi lekin tathyon ke liye yah zyada mushkil bharaa vakt he
 There is more evidence of post-saturn time
 mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke netritv main nayaa samaajwaad ek post truth prayog he
 The old SP, which was a bully of activists, rode on Akhilesh's back till the end
 ve daagiyon ko nikaalkar unhen party main waapas lete rahe or iske baavjood log yah vishwaas karne ko taiyaar dikhe ki sapa badal gai he
 Shiv Sena and BJP have been partners in every sin-virtue in Maharashtra for a long time
 is baar nikaay chunaav main donon alag-alag maidan main utrin
 The BJP gained strength with the help of Congress, NCP and MNS defectors
 log bade taav se bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shashan badalane nikle lekin unke haath lagi phir vahi shivasena-bhaajapa kii jodi jise vah badalanaa chaahate the
 It is also post truth that after demonetisation, crores were spent in just three days of campaigning in Varanasi or in the election before which the Supreme Court prohibited the use of religion and caste, from Prime Minister to Adna workers of all parties Has left no stone unturned in trying to divide the society
 aakhir aisa kya he jo samvedansheel maukon par samuhik rup se logon ko satya, tathy, tark va pramaan se pare bhaawanaaon kii jhonk main baha le jaataa he?cognitive vigyaani hugo marcier or dan sparbar ne apni nai kitaab da anigma aaf rigen main jaanane kii koshish kii he ki tark or tathy dimag par asar kyon nahin karte? vibhinn prayogon main jute manovigyaani philhal to sirf itnaa jaan paae hai ki ham ati saamaajik (hypersoshal) ho chale hai jo shaayad ek manovikar he
 Logic was born to collectively solve problems, but hyper-socialism has developed the illusion of collectively accepting what is right or knowing everything, which is a raft of facts, truth and logic
 raajnneeti ab tak vichaaron, siddhanton, yojanaon kaa takaraav rahi he
 Truth and fact are eternal
 post truth samaaj aaj kii gavarnence, raajnneeti or aarthik nitiyon ke liye badi chunauti he kyonki jatil hote samaaj main jab sarkaar kii nitiyon kaa tathyon or pramanik aankadon par aadhaarit hona anivaary he tab samaaj tathy, tark or satya kii bhoomikaaon se hi baghawat kar baitha he
 The existence of facts is not erased by negation

 Where both these terror attacks take place, they fall on the Amarnath Yatra route
 amarnath yatra ek july se shuru ho rahi he
 In view of this, adequate security arrangements have been made and the security forces are constantly wiping out the terrorists in Kashmir
 is saal ab tak 112 aatanki maare ja chuke hai
 Due to the action of Indian security forces, the terrorists of Pakistan are frightened and they can go to some extent in this fury
 sutron ke mutabik aatanki amarnath yatra ke dauraan fidaayin hamale kar sakate hai
 Sources say that instead of terrorist organizations jaish-e-mohammed and lashkar-e-taiba, small Pakistan-based terrorist organizations such as Al Badr and Al Omar Mujahideen dodged security agencies and targeted security forces engaged in protecting the Amarnath Yatra Can
 is khatre ko bhaanpate hue suraksha balon or grih mantralay ne is saal amarnath yatra ke dauraan suraksha ke pukhta intjaam kiye hai
 According to the information received by Aaj Tak from the security department, more than 350 paramilitary forces companies will be deployed in security during this time of Amarnath Yatra
 amarnath yatra ko lekar grih mantralay or suraksha balon ne badi taiyaari kii he
 In fact, after the Pulwama attack, security forces have changed the standard operating system (SOP) in many ways
 sutron ne ajtak ko bataaya ki jammu-kashmir ke nagarikon ko bina asuvidha die yatra ke dauraan unke trephic ko roka jayega
 Also, a small number of convoys will be added to the trains during the journey
 is saal zyada sankhya main bullate pruf or empivi gadiyon ko shaamil kiya jayega
 This year, the number of ROP and anti-sabotage Team has been increased on both Pahalgam and Baltal routes

 Along with this, the company's profit was also misrepresented in the quarter ended 30 September

 The shareholders of Satyam started protesting after the deal of these two companies of Maytas Group

 Before resigning from the post of Satyam's chairman, b Ramalinga Raju has written a mail to the board members about his scam
 raju ne likhaa he ki main behad bhare man auki pachhataave se apni anrtatma kii awaz par aapke saamne apane farjivade kii sachai bataa rahaa hum
 In the quarter ended September 30, 2008 - the company's balance sheet shows fake bank balance and cash of Rs 5040 crores - the interest of Rs 376 crores in it is wrong - it is referring to fake liabilities of Rs 1230 crores
 It has also been made - the profit is told to be 649 crores instead of 61 crores - Income has also been shown to be 2700 crores instead of 2112 crores - There is also mention of fake cash of 588 crores in the account
 Ha that they were now ready to face legal action and had taken to save all these steps the company

 The Bhopal police has registered a case against 2 youths on the social networking site Facebook for false posts and likes related to Hindu deities
 donon yuvakon ke khilaaf rashtriya suraksha kanoon (NSA) lagaaya gaya he
 According to the police, Ali Hassan Zafar-ul Sheikh (32) and Abdul Qayyum (31) have been arrested for posting against Facebook Parindhu Dharma and liking activities related to it
 bhopal police ne donon yuvakon ko mumbai ke wadala se local police kii madad se 19 may ko giraftaar kiya he
 According to SP Arvind Saxena from Karyabhopal North after protests in Bhopal, the NSA Act has been imposed on both the youths under sections 295 (A), 153 (A) and Section 66 of the IPC
 in dhaaraon ke mutabik kisi vishesh dharm ke khilaaf kisi duusare samudaay ke dwaara maahaul bigaadane ke liye koshish karnaa or iti act kaa ullaghann karnaa he
 According to police, Ali posted a post against Hinduism in a group called 'naadan Parinde' on Facebook, while Abdul continued to like the page
 jo ki ek sajishan aparaadh he
 After the protest in Bhopal, the police registered a case against both and arrested them
 parivaaravaalon ne giraftaar par uthaae sawalbhopal police ne donon komumbai ke wadalake giraftaar kiya he
 While the family of the accused has reached the Mumbai High Court against this arrest
 parivaar waalon kaa kahana he ki police ne galat tareeke se donon ko giraftaar kiya he
 Ali's father Zafar-ul Hasan alleges that the police is not allowing him to meet his son
 unka kahana he ki bhopal police ne bevajaah unke bete ko giraftaar kiya he
 The argument that the social environment continues to deteriorate was deteriorating only in Bhopal, why is it not affecting Mumbai? chunavi kamyaabi ke liye hindutv ko vyapak hindu jansamarthan kii darkaar he
 This means imparting caste identity to a larger religious structure and promoting a Hindu community with shared interests above caste affiliations
 yah dharmik pahchaan voton ko lamaband karne kaa aadhaar ban jaati he or baqayada abhiyaan chalaakar votaron ko samajhaayaa jaataa he ki hinduon main bhale hi aantarik matbhed hon, jinhen jatigat vibhaajan or tikhaa karte hon par vyapak saajha hiton ke liye unhen ekajute hona hi chahie
 There is no doubt that caste is a mirror of social hegemony
 aaazaad bharat main gaiyr-barabari, jatigat bhedbhaav or prakhar siyaasi swar kaa nateeja he ki daliton or obisi main is vyavastha ko khaarij karne kaa hausala aayaa he
 He embraced caste politics and claimed rights and entitlements in a secular society, in a society in which abolition is equal and everyone has the right to a chance of success
 mandal ayog kii report ke baad paravaan chadhi jati kii raajnneeti 2014 tak apane aap main hindutv kii raajnneeti kii dushman maaloom padati thi, maano hindutv kii raajnneeti keval oonchi jatiyon ke liye he
 Due to electoral needs, political parties that embraced Hindutva had to give place to caste politics
 hindutv ko jati ke daavon ko hathiyanna padaa or jatigat pahchaan ko 'dharmaparayan' se badalakar 'dharmarakshak' bananaa padaa
 Hindutva could easily mobilize the upper castes on the basis of nationalism associated with religion, but this needed a more rigorous discussion to convince the obcs and Dalit communities as these communities were deeply skeptical of the 'brahminical' value system and Used to associate it with Hindutva
 hindutv ne jin tareekon se in samudaayon main paith banaai, unamem tamaam jatiyon ke nayakon ko apnaanaa or hindu yoddhaon ke taur par unka mahimamandan karnaa shaamil tha
 Organizations of Hindutva paused to commemorate the 'jayantis' of such heroes, erected idols and gave them hero status outside their caste identities
 kabhi rajbharon ke hero rahe suheldev sareekhe nayakon ko aresas ne hindu nayak qaraar diya, kyonki kehete hai ki unhone gaznavi ke general ko haraaya tha
 Feminist kings like Baldev and Daldev, who opposed the oppression of upper castes, were also celebrated, who once used to be heroes and icons of parties like BSP, but are now national heroes
 is tarah apanaae gaye nayakon main jatav samudaay ke ravidaas or supach rishi; bandhua mazdooron ke hakon ke liye ladgaye kii vajah se musahar samudaay main poojit dina-bhadri; ahir nayak loric yadav shaamil hai
 The most famous among them is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel (of the Kurmi community) who was not given his right according to the legend of Hindutva
 uttar pradesh main bhaajapa ne 2014 main jatiyon ke nayakon ko gale lagane kaa matpetiyon main jamkar phayda uthaaya
 Suheldev was no longer a fierce king of the lower caste, but he was the one to protect the nation from foreign aggressors
 isane rajya ke dalit or obisi votaron ko bhaajapa ke paale main laane main madad kii
 The bjp-led government also named the new 'superfast' rail from Ghazipur to Delhi on Suheldev
 hindutv kii raajnneeti ne chaturaai se jatiyon ke hero ko rashtriya nayakon main mila liya or is tarah hindustan, hindu dharm or hindutv ko akhand vichaar main milaane main kaamyaab rahi
 This is why it is difficult to separate the rhetoric of BJP leaders on Pulwama, Balakot and national security from their rhetoric on the Ram temple
 'vikaas' bhale hi 2014 kaa naaraa ho, par lagata he aatankwaad or mandir bhaajapa kaa mul agenda he
 The politics of Hindutva has tried to keep itself at par with the 'nation' and 'national interest', within which caste has been incorporated later
 aresas ne hindi pattee ke gaiyr-jatav dalit samudaayon or gaiyr-yadav obisi main bahut kaam kiya he
 He has also worked among tribals, nomads and other marginalized castes in tribal areas from Gujarat to Tripura
 iske peeche iraadaa hameshaa upi, madhya pradesh, rajasthan, chhattisgarh or jharkhand main in samoohon kii rajnatik sambhaavna ko golband karnaa or apni seva, apane saamaajik kaam ko keemtee voton main badalanaa tha
 Over time, the BJP managed to emphasize the fame and legend of caste history by linking caste consciousness with the consciousness of Hinduism, moving away from resistance to caste oppression
 hindutv ke vimarsh in samudaayon ke itihaas, pahchaan, sansadhano, pratikon or samskritiyon kii phir se vyakhya karte hai or unhen vedon, puraanon or ram ke swayambhu hindu aakhyaan se jodate hai
 In this general election, the Bharatiya Janata Party has taunted the metaphors of nationalist and Hindutva with a far more silent appeal of aspirations
 essi or obisi vot jutaney kii garaj se bhaajapa ne jati aadhaarit partiyon ke saath gathjod bhi kaayam kiye hai
 Take Apna Dal led by Union Minister Anupriya Patel (kurmi caste of Uttar Pradesh) or its alliance with Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party led by influential Uttar Pradesh Minister Om Prakash Rajbhar in the east of the state
 is gathbandhan ne paanch saal pehle nishchit hi madad kii thi
 Accordingly, Nitish Kumar and Ram Vilas Paswan have been linked in Bihar
 oonchi jatiyon ke hindu bade paimaane par hindutv kii vichaardhaara ke saath hai hi
 Many Vaishya communities also consider themselves the basis of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 2014 main vyapak jati gathjod kaayam kiya gaya tha par uske baad khaasi uthal-puthal hui he
 Will the BJP be able to convince Dalits and obcs further that their well being is with the party and that Hindutva nationalism should not include other minority communities but include them in itself?

 tanushri ne aarope lagaaya tha ki saal 2008 main film horn oke plis ke sets par naanaa ne unke saath abhadra vyavhaar kiya tha
 He had said that Nana had forced the intimate steps in the choreography of the song of the film
 diarector rakesh saarang, koreographer ganesh acharya, produsar sami siddiki kaa naam bhi tanushri ne is cese main ghasita tha
 After this report, the police started questioning the sets of eyewitnesses present at the time
 baad main mumbai oshivada police thane ne naanaa patekar ko is maamle main clin chit de di thi
 He said that he could not find any evidence against Nana Patekar, from which he could not file a charge sheet nor demand a trial
 itnaa hi nahin is report main bhi kaha gaya tha ki ye shikaayat badale kii bhaavana se file kii gai ho sakati he or lagata he ki ye nakli he
 Finally, it was said in the report that no firm evidence has been found against Nana Patekar, Rakesh Sarang, Ganesh Acharya and Samee Siddiqui
 us samay sets par maujuud 13 chashmadid, jisamen koreographer / actress daiji shah, tanushri kii hair dreser, spot boy shaamil hai, ne apane bayanon main kaha ki unhone kuch bhi aisa nahin dekha, jisamen naanaa patekar, tanushri kaa shoshan kar rahe hon
 After this, an interview had given an interview to the Bombay Times, saying how dirty our law and order system is
 saath hi unhone ye daawa kiya tha ki police ke paas koi saboot nahin he kyonki usne logon ke sabhi chashmadidon ke bayanon ko record hi nahin kiya he
 Tanushree had said, 'this is ugly, because Nana Patekar has been trying to get a clean chit for a long time
 maine ye baat apane pehle intervyuu main bhi bataai thi ki sabhi gavaahon ko dhamkee bhari colls aa rahi hai or unpar police ke paas apane bayaan ko record naa karne kaa puraa-puraa dabaav banaaya ja rahaa he
 We have 10 witnesses, out of which only one-half statement has been recorded
 baaki log aage hi nahin aae kyonki unhen dhamkee bhare kol kiye gaye the
 "he further said," The police say he has no proof
 saboot milenge kaise, agar mujrim is baat par puraa dhyaan de rahaa he ki uske khilaaf saboot piles tak pahunche hi naa? jin gavaahon ke bayaan police ne record kiye hai, wo unke dost hai
 At the time none of the people on the film sets were actually my friends
 iske saath hi gavaahon ne ye nahin kaha ki us samay kuch nahin hua, unhone kaha ki unhen kuch yaad nahin he
 On the other hand, Nana Patekar called Tanushree a liar and said that there could be nothing like that on the sets because there were 50 people on the sets at that time

 Many leaders of the party, including Arvind Kejriwal, had blamed the EVM for the defeat, but in the meeting held on Thursday, many leaders cited the Modi wave and the absence of the party on the ground as the main reason for the defeat
 darasal, vidhayakon ne is baithak main apni baat rakhte hue kaha ki haar ke liye sirf iviem ko jimmedaar tehraana sahi nahin he

 lekin hamaare jawan unke khilaaf ladaai ladate hai
 But Congress leaders say that the demand for independence of Kashmir is right
 congress kaa ek bhi netaa unki aalochana nahin kar rahe hai
 Modi said that earlier some of the Congress used to say, now preach to us
 ham jab congress mukt bharat kehete hai to unhen yaad dilaa den ki ab mahatma gandhi vaali congress nahin rahi he, naa hi aazaadee ke diwaanon vaali congress nahin rahi he

 He has insulted the government, army, parliament

 rafel deal par chal rahaa vivaad thamata nahin dikh rahaa he
 When Finance Minister Arun Jaitley surrounded the Congress on the Rafael Deal, Rahul retaliated within a few hours
 rahul ne rafel deal par jetali se teen sawaal kiye hai
 These are the three questions: Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has hit back at Jaitley through three questions just hours after his press conference
 1
 Rahul has asked whether there is a difference between the money of the first and second contracts of Rafael? 2
 fiter plane banane kaa 60 saalon kaa anubhav rakhane vaali echeel company ke bajaae kis aadhaar par ek aise bijnesaman ko contract diya gaya jisane apni puri jindagi main ek bhi fital plane kaa nirmaan nahin kiya?3
 Has the entire cabinet passed this contract ? Was permission taken from the CCS (cabinet Committee on Security) for which Jaitley himself is a member? Gherarahul also accused PM Modi of taking an arbitrary decision on delay in the Parliament session
 rahul ne kaha ki yah rashtriya suraksha kaa maamla he
 Apart from Rafael, Rahul also surrounded the Modi government for delay in the winter session of Parliament
 jetali ne poocha tha- dhai saal baad kaise yaad yisase pehle rafel saude ko lekar vittamantriarun jetali ne congress par jabardast palatwarkia tha
 Jaitley asked why the Congress remembers the deal made two and a half years ago at the time of Gujarat elections
 jetali ne kaha ki upie sarkaar ke dauraan rafel deal puri nahin ho saki, jo is baat kaa saboot he ki purvavarti sarkaar non parforming sarkaar thi
 The delay was weakened by the delay in the deal
 Air Forcejetli said that the offensive capability of the Indian Air Force was being weakened by the delay in the Rafale deal
 bhartiya vayusena ko isaki sakht jarurat he, lihaaja hamane yah deal jald kii
 He said that now it is not understood that Rafale deal has been two and a half years, but why did the Congress not question it during this period? How the Rafael Deal Congress remembered now in the Gujarat elections
 rahul par ksaa tha tanjarahul gandhi par tanj kasate hue jetali ne kaha tha ki sansad satr ko 15 disambar se bulaanaa padaa, jo paanch janvari tak chalegaa
 i regret that Rahul Gandhi will not be able to go abroad in the New Year Party this time

 Let us tell you that on Wednesday, the US has bluntly asked Pakistan (pakistan) to take concrete, precise and decisive action against the terrorists and now if there is another terrorist attack on India then it is 'very difficult' for Islamabad
 It will be done
 america (US) ke ek varisht prashasnic adhikari ne buudhvaar ko white house main media se kaha, ‘yah jaruri he ki pakistan jaish-e-mohammad (jaish-e-mohammed) or lashkar-e-taiyaba jaise aatanki sanghathanon par kaabo karne ke liye thos evam nirnaayak karrwai kare taaki kshetra main phir se tanaav nahin bade

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said on Monday that 'people who come here and give speeches on the state government and aspire to become the Prime Minister, i have a simple suggestion that they should first become the Chief Minister of a state and know what to run as Chief Minister
 it happens
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki vah aisa isliye kah rahe hai kyonki rajya sarkaar kin-kin kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karti he or kaise apana kaam karti iskaa unhen andaaj lag sake
 During his tenure, Nitish claimed that there was a decrease in the number of people seeking employment from Bihar, saying that the Chief Ministers of many other states including the Chief Minister of Punjab worked due to the decrease in the number of laborers coming from Bihar in their state
 Have expressed concern about the difficulty in isko lekar media main kai samachar chap chuke hai

 congress ke liye karnataka hi bada sahaara he, jin chand rajyon main uski sarkaar he usamen yah bada rajya he
 a scheme by the Siddaramaiah government seems to be a better option for increasing revenue than the NDA government's ambitious economic reform program GST
 apane khaas i-ve bill system kii vajah se vah centre sarkaar or anya rajyon ke liye preranarot ban gaya he
 Elections are due in Karnataka this year, but despite the election time, this particular scheme can be a big relief for traders
 karnataka ne vyapaariyon kii samasya ko dekhte hue electranik ve bill yaa i-ve bill system kii shuruyaat kii he, is vyavastha ke jariye jis tarah se rajyabar main 10 kimi se dur 50 hajaar kii keemat se zyada ke saamaan ko bheja ja saktaa he, usee tarah duusare rajyon main bhi trading kii ja sakati he
 The Goods and Services Tax (GST), implemented in September, was implemented by the central government in the middle of last year, but monthly income has been steadily declining since October, and the target is less than Rs 91,000 crore
 yah centre main modi sarkaar or bhaajapa shasit rajyon ke liye bhi chintaa kaa bada kaaran banataa ja rahaa he
 Therefore, despite opposition at the political level, Karnataka's e-way bill system is being accepted
 oktober main jiesti council kii baithak main i-ve bill kii baat saamne ai thi
 Karnataka then suggested that the e-way bill system be moved out of one state and 4-5 states be added to it, then it could be implemented at the national level
 karnataka ne 12 sitambar, 2017 ko i-ve bill kii shuruyaat kii thi
 It was designed and developed in the state itself in August 2017 before its implementation, then it was implemented as an experiment
 'behad aasaan he yah system'indian express main chhapi khabar ke mutabik, system main har din ek lakh se zyada log i-ve bill janaret kar rahe hai
 1 lakh 20 thousand dealers and 947 transports have been registered under this system
 karnataka main i-ve bill kii tarah hi i-sugam (simple apaloding of guds araival and movement) 2011 se chal rahi thi
 To operate VAT in the state
 haalanki i-sugam ko pichley saal 24 sitambar ko rajya ke vyavsaayik kar vibhaag ne band kar diya he
 Then within 8 to 10 days, the state launched the e-way bill system, which was accepted by the traders there
 ek adhikari ke mutabik, i-ve bill system bahut aasaan he
 For the supply of goods, get yourself registered in the bill, give 6-7 essential information, give the train number, then your e-way permit will be issued
 kahin roke jane par transporter ko yahi i-ve permit dikhaanaa hoga jo mobile main darj hoga
 Currently, only 2 per cent of the people have an e-way permit checked based on the experience so far in Karnataka
 jabaki mahaj 0
 2 per cent of the goods have been examined by the authorities

 rajasthan main hui kuch ghatnaon se sanket miltaa he ki prashasan par se mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje kii pakad chhot rahi he, jise vaise bhi ve zyaadaatar afasaron ke bharose chalaa rahi hai
 Recently some videos and photos went viral
 inamen se ek video main sthaneey shashan mahakme ke pramukh sachiv manjit singh ko kathith taur par unke samparkon ke paise se yojit ek party main sharaab kaa majaa lete hue dikhaaya gaya
 That too at a time when the uncontrolled deaths of cows in Hingonia's Goshalas under his department had shaken the whole country
 unki ek or tasviir saamne ai, jisamen ve sthaneey ashok club main ashok singhvi ke saath dekhe gaye
 Singhvi is also a high-profile officer these days and has spent eight months in jail for his role in the mineral scam
 sarkaar apni suvidha ke mutabik chaahe to donon hi maamalon ko kadachaar maan sakati he yaa unka nijee aacharan bhi bataa sakati he
 But the fact is that people have raised questions on this and have seen it linked to the careless attitude of the administration towards the death of hundreds of cows in the last one month
 isse janaakrosh kaa pataa chalata he
 These cows lost their lives after being trapped in mud after the rains, when the owners of the gaushalas left them on their halls and went on strike due to non-payment of their dues
 varisht afasaron ne mantri raajapaal singh yaa mukhyamantri ko is maamle kii gambhirtha ke bare main bataane kii bhi parvaah nahin kii
 Earlier, the Rajasthan High Court was repeatedly asking the government and local authorities to improve the situation in Hingonia and prevent corruption there
 is saal kii shuruyaat main hycourt ne anti karpshan beuro (asibi) ke mahanireekshak dinesh emen ko bhrashtachariyon ke khilaaf karrwai karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 After the slaughter of the cows, slapping the bureaucratic mouth, the High Court once again ordered Dinesh to go and find out the reasons for the death
 dinesh afasarshahon samet bhrashtachar main lipt sarkari karmchaariyon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai kar rahe the or unhone hi singhvi ko giraftaar kiya tha
 But a few weeks ago, he was removed from the ACB due to pressure from the corrupt lobby of the officers
 baad main adaalat ne aadha darjan bade afasaron ko talab kiya or gaayon kii dekhbhaal main had darje kii laaparvaahee ke liye unhen fatkaar lagaai
 He rejected the government's weak reply, stating that it had set two lower-level officers accused of going on leave in times of crisis
 sarkaar ne bade afasaron kii bhoomika kii koi jaanch-padtaal nahin kii, jise adaalat ne or viral video ne bhi ujagar kiya he
 The High Court also said that the authorities ignored the court's direction and warned only when Prime Minister Modi summoned the report
 raaje ne aanan-fanan main fori kadam uthaae or halaat sudhaarney kii koshish kii
 He sent cows to private cowsheds and invited religious and corporate people to adopt Hingonia
 par afasar abhi bhi lipapoti main lage hai
 For example, they are keeping registers and getting CCTV cameras installed at the gate of Goshala for the admission of guests
 yahi vajah he ki congress ko apane rajya adhyaksh sachin payalat kii aguai main baithe-bithaae ek mudda mil gaya or usne hindu vishwaason ko lekar hamalaa bol diya, jo bijepi ke agenda main sabase upar hai
 Raje is also facing attacks in the party over the death of cows and is being led by his opponents like Ghanshyam Tiwari
 magar raaje ko is baat kaa ehsaas nahin he ki unke kuch afasarshahon ne aise halaat paidaa kar die hai, jisamen hindu kattarpanthi unhen hindu virdohi ke taur par dekh rahe hai
 Earlier some such officers had demolished the temples for the Metro work around the ring road and within the city
 tab aresas raaje ke virodh main utar aayaa tha
 Shortly before the Hingonia incident, there were attempts to acquit big bureaucrats from failure, when ACB, a chief engineer R

 Meena and Subodh Jain, an additional chief engineer, were caught in a major bribery scam
 giraftaareyon ke baad pramukh sachiv je
 C
 mohanti ko sthaneey media main yah kehete hue pesh kiya gaya ki ejiniyaron ne sarkaar kii badanaami karwaai he
 But everyone is asking whether Raje questioned Mohanty why he was blindly approving the files sent by corrupt officers and why he never took any step to stop corruption? In a conversation with India Today, half a dozen senior officials admitted that they had not taken any action against any of their subordinates for corruption in the last 15 years
 vahiin asibi ke afasaron ne sweekaar kiya ki kisi bhi pramukh sachiv yaa atirikt mukhya sachiv ne unhen bhrashtachar kii kabhi koi shikaayat nahin bheji
 The Hingonia issue is reminiscent of other avoidable tragedies

 At the same time, in May, the High Court had summoned DGP Manoj Bhatt to explain the absence of police in the case of missing a woman, he was dizzy

 The rejection of corruption has made people so angry that they have started voting against BJP
 panchayat or sthaneey nikaayon kii 37 siton ke haalia upachunaavon main congress ne apni siten badhaakar 16 se 19 kar leen, jabaki bijepi kii siten 16 se ghatakar 10 par aa gayi
 Pilot says these by-elections, spread across 21 districts and attended by millions of voters, were like a mid-term referendum
 vahiin bijepi ke rajya adhyaksh ashok paranami kehete hai ki zyaadaatar chunaav un ilaakon main hue jahaan congress kaa majboot aadhaar he
 However, he also said that he would investigate the reasons for the defeat
 yah jaruri bhi he kyonki mantriyon ke saath bijepi kaaryakartaaon or vidhayakon kii zyaadaatar baatcheet main kaaryakartaaon ne naukarshahi main bhrashtachar or naakaaraapan par gussa jaahir kiya he
 Parnami has done well by initiating this type of dialogue on completion of half term of the BJP government, as it will give the workers a chance to vent their anger and take corrective steps
 lekin bhrashtachar main lipt bade afasaron ke khilaaf kadai to raaje ko hi kerani padegi

 The comments maaloom ho ki ucchtam nyaayalay ne gat 21 march ko ayodhya ke vivaadit sthal ke maamle ko 'samvedansheel' or 'bhaavnaatmak maamla' bataate hue kaha tha ki iskaa hal talash karne ke liye sabhi sambandhit pakshon ko naye sire se prayaas karne chahie
 a bench headed by Chief Justice JS Khehar had said that such religious issues could be resolved through negotiations and had also offered to mediate to reach a consensus
 haalanki ucchtam nyaayalay dwaara ram janmabhumi-babari masjid vivaad ko adaalat se baahar sulajhane ke suzav or paraspar samvaad main madhyasth kii bhoomika nibhaane kii peshkash kaa ol india muslim personal lau board sahit kuch pramukh muslim sanghathanon ne swaagat to kiya, magar ve adaalat ke baahar is maamle ke samaadhaan ko lekar zyada ashanvit nahin hai
 The Trust Chairman said that Hindustan got independence after a big struggle
 uske baad is raashtra ke vibhaajan ke falswaroop pakistan kaa janm hua
 Will the agreement between the two sides over the disputed site not lead to another split in Ayodhya? He said that only two years after the partition of the country, the efforts of Sardar Patel and other leaders paved the way for the construction of a grand temple on Somnath Jyotirlinga of Gujarat
 vahiin, ayodhya me shriram janmabhumi kaa vivaad nyaayalay ke chakkar lagaataa rahaa
 If it were resolved at the same time, there would not have been much bloodshed
 tippaniyan It may be noted that on March 21, the Supreme Court had termed the disputed site of Ayodhya as a 'sensitive' and 'emotional matter' and said that all concerned parties should try afresh to find a solution
 pradhan nyaayadhish nyaayamurti je es khehar kii adhyakshata vaali peeth ne kaha tha ki aise dharmik muddon ko baatcheet se suljhaayaa ja saktaa he or unhone sarvasammati par pahunchane ke liye madhyasthata karne kii peshkash bhi kii thi
 Although some major Muslim organizations including the All India Muslim Personal Law Board welcomed the Supreme Court's suggestion to settle the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid dispute out of court and to play an intermediary in the dialogue, they were out of court There is not much hope about the resolution of the case

 In the capital Delhi, due to not giving a week, some fearless miscreants killed a young man running a chicken corner by stabbing him
 police ne shav ko postmortem ke liye bhejkar maamle kii tafteesh shuru kar di he
 The victim's family alleges that the youth had also complained to the police about this, but the police did not take any action in the matter
 hatyaki yah vaardaat dilli ke gandhi nagar thana ilaake kii he
 In the capital Delhi, the fear of the police among criminals is ending
 us par police kii laaparvaahee aparaadhiyon ko sangrakshan de rahi he
 This failure of the police resulted in a suhagan widow after just 3 months of marriage
 darasal, gandhi nagar thana kshetra ke ajit nagar main rahane vaala yuvak shahabuddin vahiin ek chikan corner chalaa kar apane parivaar kaa pet paalataa tha
 She was married 3 months ago
 sab kuch thik chal rahaa tha
 Meanwhile some goons of the area followed him
 usase haftaa maangane lage
 Troubled, Shahabuddin complained about this at the Gandhi Nagar police station
 lekin vahaan ke stoff ne use ye kahkar samajha diya ki ab badmaash uske paas nahin aaenge
 But this assurance of the police proved fatal for Shahabuddin
 shuukravaar kii der raat shahabuddin apana chikan corner band karke paas hi main apane dost kii dukaan par ja rahaa tha
 In the meantime, some miscreants who were chasing him surrounded him and attacked him with knives
 aasapaas ke log fouran use aspataal le gaye lekin raste main shahabuddin keemautaho gai
 After receiving the information, the police reached the spot and took the body in possession and sent it for postmortem
 police ab police aasapaas lage sisitivi camaron kii footage khangaal rahi he, taaki hamalaavaron kii pahchaan ho sake
 Shahabuddin's family is shocked by this massacre
 teen maheene pehle hi uski shaadi hui thi
 It is not yet clear how on August 14, the submarine INS Sindhurakshak, standing in the Naval Dockyard in Mumbai, exploded so horribly that it sank into the water and killed 17 naval personnel
 shahid hone waalon main leftinent commander nikhilesh paal bhi the
 Chief of Naval Admiral d
 ke
 Joshi said that there were two explosions
 vishakhapatnam main farvari, 2010 main isi pandubbi main hui durghatana kii jaanch karne vaale nausena adhikariyon kaa anumaan he ki sambhavat: isaki badariyon se hydrogen gas banane ke kaaran visphot hua ho kyonki us samay bhi isi vajah se visphot hua tha
 It is believed that a leak from the battery compartment exploded around 10 tonnes of torpedoes and anti-ship missiles placed in the submarine
 rus main nirmit 2,300 ton vajan kaa sindhurakshak ab bilkul bekaar ho chukaa he
 It returned from Russia in April this year after some new changes
 rus main isamen kuch nae sensor or missile feet kiye gaye the, jis par kareeb 8 karod dollar kaa kharch aayaa tha
 The destruction of this submarine, used to kill enemy warships and submarines, has caused heavy damage to the navy, because the navy fleet is already underwater
 nausena ke paas kul 14 dijal pandubbiyaan hai, jabaki use 24 kii jarurat he
 Last year, it took nuclear power submarine INS Chakra from Russia on a 10-year lease and now there is talk of taking another such submarine
 iske alaava desh main hi nirmit pehali belistic missile pandubbi arihant kaa parmaanu riector 9 agast ko chaalu ho gaya
 But due to this delay, the naval warfare is being affected
 yahaan tak ki apni 14 pandubbiyon ke bede ko banaae rakhane ke liye bhi use har saal ek pandubbi lene kii jarurat he
 The Navy has not carried a single submarine in 13 years
 2008 kii sieji report ke mutabik aadhi se zyada pandubbiyaan 30 saal ke apane jivan kii aadhi se zyada umr puri kar chuki hai
 New submarines are not coming fast
 mumbai ke majgaanv dockyard main francisi dizin vaali chah scorpen pandubbiyaan banane ke liye 2005 main 18,000 karod ru
 Was contracted, but it is also five years behind schedule
 is tarah kii pehali pandubbi 2012 main nausena ke bede main shaamil ho jaani chahie thi, lekin ab vah 2017 main hi mil paaegi
 The Navy has raised Rs 36,000 crore for 751 submarines
 ke chah project kii yojana taiyaar kar lee he
 These submarines will be built with foreign cooperation
 iskaa contract abhi kisi ko nahin diya gaya he or isamen 10 saal kaa samay lag saktaa he
 The Navy was to be sent to Russia to equip seven submarines of 10 kg class, but it has been delayed for more than two years as Indian shipyards have failed to complete the work on time
 jaankaar log nausena main maanav shakti ke sankat kii ore bhi ishaara karte hai
 "the traditional submarine fleet does not have the right people for the right thing," says a Navy official
 ” iske alaava karmchaariyon kii sankhya jarurat se zyada he
 Five years ago the Navy had 300 submarine officers
 lekin vistaar kii yojanaon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue inaki sankhya 700 tak pahunchaa di gai
 These plans also include six Scarpen submarines, which may join the Navy fleet by 2020
 is tarah kii deree se, jinamein scorpen pandubbiyon kii yojana bhi shaamil he, maujuuda adhikariyon kaa kaarykaal bhi kuch maamalon main 18 maheene se ghatakar 6 maheene tak pahunch gaya he
 Clearly, the crisis within the sea is increasing
 haal hi main bal bharti ne nauveen kaksha ke paathyakram main badlaav kiya tha jise lekar vivaad khadaa ho gaya tha
 Dutt said that the book made no mention of the fact that the Supreme Court had given a clean chit to Rajiv Gandhi in the Bofors case
 yah naa keval nyaayalay ke aadesh kaa apmaan he balki raajnneetik uddeshyon ke liye tathyon ko chhipaana bhi he
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 )(hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) congress-ensipi main sarkaar ke formule par hui charchashivsena ke saath roteshnal siem chaahati he encipicongress ke liye paanch saal tak dipti siem par charchaamaharashtra kii siyasat main sarkaar banane ko lekar sangram machaa he
 On one side is the Shiv Sena, which somehow wants to sit on the throne of power in Maharashtra and on the other side is the NCP, which wants to form a government with the Shiv Sena on its own terms
 vahiin, congress ab tak tay hi nahin kar saki he ki vipareet vichaardhaaraon vaale kshatrap se dosti kii jaae yaa nahin
 Meanwhile, discussions are also going on in the Congress and NCP about the share of power
 mangalvaar ko mumbai ke wibi chavaan centre main dilli se gaye teen congress netaaon ahamed patel, mallikarjun khadge or kasee venugopal ne ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ke saath baithak kii
 According to sources, four important points were discussed in this meeting
 ensipi ne is baat par jor diya ki sthai sarkaar ke liye congress ko sarkaar kaa hissaa bananaa chahie
 Whereas Congress's emphasis was on the Common Minimum Program
 vahiin, sarkaar main hissedari par bhi ensipi ne apana formula saamne rakhaa
 According to the NCP sources, Rotational CM wants, the Congress and NCP meetings have also discussed about the post of Chief Minister
 meeting main ensipi ne formula rakhaa ki shivasena or uske bich dhai-dhai saal ke liye mukhyamantri pad kaa bantwaaraa kiya jaae, jabaki congress ko puure paanch saal ke liye dipti siem kaa pad mili
 Formula with 42 Ministers While NCP discussed the formula of CM and Deputy CM in Mumbai, the Cabinet formula came out from the Congress camp in Delhi
 congress sutron ke mutabik, party teenon dalon main satta kii baraabar bhagidaari chaahati he
 The Congress formula is to make 42 cabinet ministers and among them 14 to 14 ministers should be shared with Shiv Sena and NCP
 yani congress-shivasena or ensipi ke 14-14 mantri sarkaar main rahen
 With this, the Congress is eyeing important ministries like Home and Revenue
 congress kaa maananaa he ki is tarah ke mahatvapurn mantralayon kaa bantwaaraa bhi uchit hona chahie
 That is, despite being the lowest MLA, the Congress wants to remain strong in the government
 vahiin, shivasena kaa mukhyamantri hone kii surat main do up-mukhyamantri kaa formula bhi charchaa ke centre main he
 However, no clear talks have been held between the three parties on all these issues so far
 mangalvaar ko ensipi-congress kii baithak ke ahamed patel or sharad pavaar ne bataaya ki abhi donon dalon ke bich baatcheet honi he or uske baad shivasena se baat kii jaaegi
 At the same time, after the press conference of Ahmed Patel and Sharad Pawar, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray spoke to the media and told that we also need time to negotiate and that is why Shiv Sena asked for an extension from the Governor
 baharhaal, philhal maharashtra main raashtrapati shashan lagu ho gaya he or is faisle ke khilaaf shivasena supreme court pahunch gai he
 In such a situation, where everyone's eye is on the decision of the Supreme Court, then it will also be interesting to see how long the three parties can come on one platform and if the government is formed then on what formula is the final
 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani kii 'jan chetana yatra' ko bihar ke sitabadiara se shuru karne ke mudde par kathith manmutav kii khabaron ko khedjanak or nindaneey bataate hue narendra modi ne kaha he adwani ke saath unhen bahut najadik se kaam karne kaa saubhaahgya mila he
 Modi has written on his blog, 'but the kind of jokes some selfish elements are taking is extremely regrettable and condemnable
 ' unhone likhaa he ki unki yah jan chetana yatra bharat kaa bhagya badalane kaa kaam karegi
 Modi wrote on his blog, 'advani ji spent his youth in the country service

 adwani ji jaise netaa kisi pad kii prapti ke liye yatra karte hai, aisa haasyaaspad bayaan dene waalon par mujhe dayaa aati he
 Modi, who came out in support of Advani's Jan Chetna Yatra, said that his journey is coming out of Jayaprakash Narayan's birth anniversary and birthplace, it is consistent
 unhone kaha ki kabhi-kabhi sukhad ghatnaayen bhi aakaar leti hai
 He is starting his journey from the same Bihar state where Advani's chariot was stopped
 modi likhte hai, 'adwani ji kii is jan chetana yatra kaa kaaphi mahatv he kyonki iskaa makasad bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai he, kaala dhan videsh se laane kii maang he

 There has been increasing pressure on the BJP due to speculation that a front could be formed between the two parties
 duusari taraf, argedy kaa daawa he ki paswan unke mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone ja rahe hai
 According to the Times of India, the possibility of any such front before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is bound to upset BJP

 Commitment phobia

 He is no longer the best selling author
 ye jagah ek or desi ne le lee he
 Kanya, named Aanchal Reddy

 On which she does not even believe

 UD makes a pact to get his car and luck back
 khud par hi chummaa uchhaalate ek bhartiya single screen filmon ke star armaan ke liye script likhane kaa karata he faisla
 Well there is nothing like writing
 bas bahut sari videshi filmein dekhakar, unase annu malik or preetam mark prerana le kuch likhnaa he
 From here, the love story starts according to the scenes of UD and Aanchal's film
 pehle jhikpic
 Then Ain't That Bad
 iske baad ek trip, bed and good experions or ant bed par tripping
 Now the twist should come in the story
 to imotional drama or last main happy anding
 Tear
 in sabake bich yudi kaa dost he, jo apni bivi se darataa he
 UD has an ex girlfriend
 jo ab uski friend philosfer or guide ban gai he
 And Eeritating is the current girlfriend, causing UD to get rid of
 film 'happy anding' kii sabase badi khaasiyat hai iske dialogs, jo ki ekadam taaje daal ke toote or mjedaar hai
 They fall on your face with disgust
 magar iske ird gird hi film kii sabase badi kamajori he
 And that is the story
 aisa lagata he jaise saf ali khan kii kai filmon masalan, ham-tum, salaam namaste, cocktail vagairah kaa cocktail bana diya gaya ho
 The director can say that we had already written on the poster of the film
 e kamedi on kamedi films
 But only this much, your raw dough is not made sir
 beimanti he ye
 Saif Ali Khan looks old on screen
 ab unka loparon or ladakapane se bharaa kirdaar kuch ashleel sa jaan padataa he
 Boil in old kadhi

 She is amazing isi tarah pareshaan dost ke role ranvir shouri ke liye rigerv kiye ja sakate hai
 He has great comedy timing
 superstar govinda parde par aate hai or nabbe ke dashak kii tarah hansi laate hai
 It was absolutely Taylor Made role for him
 isi tarah arase baad prity jinta ko parde par dekhnaa sukun detaa he
 She still looks very cute and serious
 film kaa mujeec mahaan nahin he
 But it is not bad either
 zyaadaatar gane aasapaas baithi janata ko yaad the
 Apparently the hits have been made by Baraste FM
 film kii raftaar thik he or length bhi bahut zyada nahin he
 Magar Ending
 jiske ird gird film kaa tittle buna gaya, bahut hi pratyaashit he
 This is where the film starts to collapse
 goyaa nirdeshak 'happy anding' karne ke dabaav main aa gaye hon, puri film main usee falsafe kaa majaak banane ke baad
 Apart from this, ud's talking to his own double role person, taking advice, is also a weakened formula, which is unable to do anything special here
 diarect raaj or krishna isse pehle shor in da city or go goa gon jaisi filmein bana chuke hai
 He had the same condition
 sambhaavnaaon se bhari, magar kai jhol bhi
 Here this director duo has worked very hard on the dialogues of the film
 lokation or treetment ke lihaaj se bhi kuch freshnes he
 But the story is bogged down forcibly making smart
 'happy anding' dekh sakate hai, agar tikhe sanvaadon vaali kamedi pasand he
 If Saif Ali Khan still sounds handsome and Ileana Cute
 film ko govinda, kalki, ranvir, prity ke liye bhi dekh sakate hai
 This is something above the average
 bas isaki 'happy anding' everej he
 a secret video of a conversation between US presidential Republican Mitt Romney and wealthy donors has revealed a new problem for Romney's election campaign
 is video main romany amir daankartaaon se kah rahe hai ki americanyon kii lagbhag aadhi aabaadi puri tarah se sarkaar par ashrith he
 This population does not pay tax
 somvaar ko jaise hi yah vivaadaaspad video saamne aayaa, obama ke chunavi abhiyaan main turant ise ek mudda bana liya gaya
 In Obama's election campaign, questions were raised about how Romney would perform the duty of a president when he was already rejecting half the country
 ‘madar jones’ patrika main video ke kuch ansh prakashit kiye gaye hai
 It shows that Romney is telling a private donor in a closed room that 47 percent of Americans will vote for Obama
 is video main romany kah rahe hai, ‘47 pratishat log obama ke saath hai
 These are the people who depend on the government
 ve apane aap ko peedit maanate hai or chaahate hai ki sarkaar unki dekhbhaal kare
 They believe that they should get health, food, house security etc
 ’romany ne aage kaha, ‘ye ve log hai jo koi iskar nahin bharte
 Therefore, our message of reduction in taxes will not work for them
 unhen apni jindagi kii jimmedaari khud uthaani chahie
 'the authenticity of the video could not be independently verified
 madar jones patrika ne apni website par video ke ansh daalane ke saath hi kaha he ki isamen shaamil log dhundhale dikhaai de rahe hai
 The whereabouts of this meeting of Romney and these donors have been kept secret for the safety of the source
 is video ke baad se kai bayaan aa rahe hai
 In Obama's election campaign, Romney has often been accused of being a millionaire entrepreneur who has no connection with the middle class
 is chhavi se baahar aane ke romany ke prayaason ke liye is video ne khaasi mushkilen paidaa kar di hai
 Jim Messina, the manager of Obama's election campaign, said, "it is surprising that a US presidential candidate calls half a US citizen a 'victim' in front of a section of rich donors behind closed doors and says that these people i do not want to take responsibility for my own life

 a few hours before the Balakot strike inside Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not give the slightest hint to the people that they had made a historic decision
 yah aisa faisla tha jo donon deshon ko jang ke muhane par khadaa kar detaa
 This scene of confrontation between the two has been going on since 2002, when the jaish-e-mohammed militants attacked Pakistan in Kaluchak in Jammu and Kashmir and killed 30 people
 1971 ke baad pehali dfa bharat pakistan ke bheetar hawaii hamalaa karne ja rahaa tha
 This decision had as far-reaching effects as Indira Gandhi had in 1974 and Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1998 declared nuclear power of India by conducting nuclear tests
 yah faisla bhavishya main aatanki hamalon kii sthiti main pakistan se bharat ke saluk main baari badlaav kaa parichaayak tha
 However after 9 PM Modi gave the green signal
 30 baje apane sarkari nivas 7, lok kalyaan maarg laute to hameshaa kii tarah shant or santulit the
 The tension between India and Pakistan after jaish-e-mohammed's fidayeen attack in Pulwama on 14 February was not mentioned in Modi's speeches in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed
 lekin pradhanmantri kaa staff yah dekh hairaan tha ki ve aadhi raat ko bhi sone nahin gaye
 Instead, in their study, they kept checking the files and sending emails while taking information about the progress of Balakot air strike
 tadake 3 baje pradhanmantri ko jaankaree di gai ki bhartiya vaayu sena ke ladaaku jet kaa bedaa udaan bhar chukaa he or jaldi hi pakistan kii seemaa main pravesh karne vaala he
 Half an hour later, they were told that the jets had fired bombs on targets in Pakistan and returned safely to their bases
 ve uske baad pakistan main hue nuksaan kii bhi jaankaree lete rahe
 He himself was exploring the social media about the reactions coming from this attack, especially from Pakistan
 aakhir subah 9
 At 40 pm, when Modi called a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security, his team came to know why he did the ritual
 isamen vitt, videsh, grih or raksha mantri hote hai
 Over the next few days, after Pakistan's counter-airstrike, there was a huge furore of controversies over the big question that what was Modi's motive behind the decision to attack the airstrips in the mainland of Pakistan? Jaish had an active camp on the target of Indian jets or was evacuated, as claimed by Pakistan? Is there evidence that Indian planes carried out precise attacks on targets with deadly weapons or just some trees in that area wreaking havoc Wrecked, as Pakistan is mocking? Pakistan's F-16 Vim in chasing down its planes during retaliation after the Balakot attack What is the evidence for the demolition? India Today is bringing out the full details for the first time with confidence from the high government sources involved in this important decision process, which will provide special information related to many important questions that emerged after the Balakot operation
 Huh
 modi ne seemaa rekha langhane kaa faisla aakhir kyon kiya?modi ne 14 farvari ko pulavama aatanki hamale kii khabar suni to unke sahyogiyon ke mutabik, suraksha balon ke javaanon kii maut se gamajada or jaish tathaa pakistan main uske aakaaon ke dussahas se ve baari gusse se bhar uthe
 He said in public meetings that the culprits of the attack would have to bear the consequences
 sahyogiyon ke mutabik modi kabhi bhi koi faisla bhaawanaaon main bahakar yaa kisi fitur main nahin karte hai
 They say that during the crisis, there should be a clear explanation of what you want, so that, as one of his colleagues says, "one can come to a firm status from his normal existence
" ''modi ke dimag main yah saaf tha ki pakistan dashakon se jo apni parmaanu takat kaa hauva dikhaata aa rahaa he, uski hawa hameshaa ke liye nikaal deni he
 Before this, this hustle has been preventing India from attacking Pakistan and thus our options have been slightly reduced
 isse pakistan ko kam kharchile aatanki hamalon ke silsile se bharat ko lahu-luhaan karne kii shah milti rahi he
 After the Uri attack in September 2016, Modi ordered a surgical strike across the Line of Control
 udi hamale main 23 log maare gaye the
 The purpose of the surgical strike was to indicate that India would not hesitate to retaliate
 haalanki aalochakon ne kaha ki aisi karravaaiyaan pehle bhi hoti rahi hai lekin uskaa hallaa nahin machaaya jaataa rahaa he
 While deciding on the attack on Pakistan, perhaps Modi followed the dictation of a Chinese general that "if you are aware of the enemy and have a sense of yourself, then you do not need to fear even a hundred wars
" agar aapako apana andaja he magar dushman kaa nahin to har jeet ke saath aapako haar bhi jhelni padegi
 If you have no idea of yourself, nor of the enemy, then you will lose every battle
 ''isamen andeh nahin ki bharat pakistan se taqatvar he
 He is a fast emerging economic force, has a secure majority government and is a leader who does not hesitate to take tough and sometimes risky decisions
 phir, modi sarkaar ko china ke alaava duniya kii badi takaton kaa samarthan hasil he
 On the other hand, Pakistan stands on the brink of economic plight and there is a weak military-dependent leader
 phir bhi, china or america donon ko uski darkaar he, ek ko apni takat main ijaphe ke liye or duusare ko afghanistan main samjhaute kii khatir
 It is also important that Pakistan is a nuclear power, so care must be taken, which a highly placed government source says, "a volatile Islamic outlook with a nuclear policy to attack first
" ''modi ekadam saaf the ki ve pulavama kii javaabi karrwai main pakistan se ulajhane par donon taraf tay tabaahiyon kii baat sochakar nahin hichakenge
 Lohomodi's allies were also contemplating what could have been a bold and imaginative attack, avoiding any threat of nuclear war
 jaisaa ek ne bataaya, ''ham moorkhon kii tarah bina soche-samajhe saahas nahin dikhaa sakate the
 In times of crisis, the Prime Minister always puts a finger on the right question and like Khanti Gujarati always looks for profit and loss
 unka maananaa he ki kharch makasad ke mukaable adhik nahin hona chahie or chaahate hai ki hameshaa yah sawaal karen ki ham kahaan hai or kahaan pahunchnaa chaahate hai
 "modi then made a statement of purpose in front of his team that India is not against the people of Pakistan or its government, but against the militant groups and its masters there
" yah bhi ki bharat kaa jawaab usee anupaat main hona chahie, jo pakistan ne kiya he
 An attack from India should be within the same scope, which the international community considers 'logical' action
 isliye gaiyr-faujee thikaanon yani aatanki prashikshan kendron par hi santulit karrwai kii darkaar thi
 Any damage to ordinary civilians or military installations should have been avoided
 ek sahyogi kehete hai, ''makasad yuddh se bachanaa nahin, balki use daayre main rakhana tha
 "india knew that there were risks in the use of air power, but the Prime Minister was very clear that we had to do something that would surprise us
" pradhanmantri ne isi had ko dhyaan main rakhkar rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal or sena ke teenon angon ke pramukhon ko khuli chhot di thi ki ve simit lakshya par koi hamalaa karen or sabhi vikalpon kii unhen jaankaree den
 Another high-level ally revealed, "the Prime Minister was very clear that there should be no escalation of war under any circumstances
" vaisaa koi lakshya nahin he
 We are not thinking of occupying any area
 donon deshon ko iske khatre kaa andaja he
 "modi told him that he must do something to give a proper answer to Pakistan but also keep in mind that there is no harm to the common people
" har byore kii pushti kii jaani chahie or nishane ke bare main khufia jaankariyaan ekadam sateek honi chahie
 So Doval, the head of the intelligence agencies and the heads of the three wings of the army, started looking for a target that was 'completely accurate', that is, no other damage was done to him
 balakot kaa chunaav kyon or kaise kiya gayousake baad khufia agenciyon ne pakistan main chal rahe kareeb pandrah shiviron ko hamale ke liye khangala
 But it was decided that Jaish was involved in the Pulwama attack, so his camp should be targeted
 aise teen shiviron kii pahchaan kii gaiah pakistan ke punjab main bahawalpur, mujaffarabad (pakistan adhikrut kashmir) ke paas savai naala or khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa main balakot
 It was difficult to avoid the damage to the common people in the attack on the camp in Bahawalpur, as mosques, hospitals and training camps emerged over the years and it is in the densely populated area of punjab
 savai naala jaish ke sabase bade campon main he lekin iskaa chunaav isliye nahin kiya gaya kyonki yah pakistan adhikrut kashmir (pioke) main he
 After the Uri attack in 2016, Modi ordered a surgical strike at Jaish's camp in pok
 lekin pulavama kaa aatanki hamalaa itnaa bada tha ki pradhanmantri ne tay kiya hua tha ki nishaanaa niyantran rekha ke paar hamale se kuch bada hona chahie
 In this way, Jaish's camp in Balakot was chosen as the right target because it is in the mainland of Pakistan
 marakaj saiyad ahamed shahid ke naam se pahachaane jane vaale is camp kii sthapana 2004-05 main hui thi or yah jaba top pahari kii dhalaan par sthit he
 This area is deserted and can be reached only after a steep climb of three km from the valley
 us camp par bhartiya khufia agenciyon kii varshon se najar rahi he
 From this, they have also made some spies for information about the activities of the camp
 chah acre main faile is camp main 10 bade makaan yaa parisar vibhinn gatividhiyon ke liye hai
 The most important thing is that this camp was run under the supervision of Yusuf Azhar, brother-in-law of Masood Azhar, and he lived here in a building which used to have a school earlier
 bharat ke hawaii hamale ke baad pakistan ne daawa kiya ki is camp ko to jaish varshon pehle khaali kar chukaa tha
 However, when the airstrikes occurred on the Balakot camp in the early hours of 26 February, it was not deserted
 india today ko bhartiya khufia agenciyon ke jutaaye byore or tasviren dekhne ko mili hai jinase khulaasa hota he ki camp jihadiyon or dusron se bharaapura tha (dekhen dehshatgardi kii maand)
 Camp Virena not Indian agencies have pictures of the route from Balakot to the camp, with the information of the camp written on one billboard and the message of recruiting recruits on the other
 tasveeron se pataa chalata he ki mukhya parisar kii ore jane vaali sidhippon par america, britain or israel ke jhande ukere gaye hai, taaki jo vahaan se gujarey, ye jhande uske pairon ke neeche kuchle jaaen
 The main campus is like a large hall shaped like the English letter U
 iske ground floor par aath kamare hai or duusari manjilon par dormetri bani he
 Indian agencies were aware of who was staying in those rooms at the time of the attack
 cameraa nan
 The 1st Chief Trainer was of Yusuf Azhar
 duusare kamaron main jaish ke senior trainer mufti umr or moulana javed (cameraa nan
 2), Maulana Aslam and Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Kashmiri (room no
 3), moulana ajmal or moulana jubair (cameraa nan
 4) were
 cameraa nan
 There were six other trainers from 5 to 8
 imaarat kii sabase upree manzil par kathith taur par 97 fidaayin the jinaki training chal rahi thi
 The mosque was at some distance
 bhartiya khufia agenciyon ke paas tasviir main masjid kii deevaaron par kashmir main maare gaye kathith sargical 'shaheedon' yaa ugravadiyon kii tasviren tangi thim
 Beside it was a two-story building with three rooms on each floor and was being used as a guest house
 vahaan lahore se aae teen kattar aatankwaadi trainer moulana kudartulla, moulana junayd or moulana kasim ruke hue the
 All three have been declared fugitives under Pakistan's anti-terror law and have not returned home for years
 kudartulla ko bada ustad mana jaataa tha jabaki kasim nae rangaruton ko marshall art main maahir banaata tha
 There is another huge campus at the northern end of the camp
 isamen ek hostel, dianing room or bada-sa haul he jisamen vibhinn tarah ke dedh sau rangarut ruke hue the
 The agencies also had information about recruits and their category of status in the organization of Jaish
 kul milakar vahaan kareeb 200 rangarut alag-alag tarah ke training course kar rahe the
 They were divided into three parts: daura-e-aam (in which 93 were being given basic training), daura-e-khas (in which 81 were given military training) and daura-e-zarar (comprising 25 recruits
 Were being trained with sophisticated weapons)
 balakot shahar main billboard vigyaapan par nae course ke liye rangaruton ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha, jinhen 25 farvari se training di jaani thi
 There should have been an estimated 300 people in the camp after that date
 hawaii strike kii yojana ke liye bani kor team kii aguai dobhaal kar rahe the or unhone balakot ke bare main pradhanmantri ko jaankaree di
 On February 19, Modi gave the green signal to the Air Force to strike
 oonchi udaan ke nayakere chif marshall birendra singh (tony) dhanoa ko jab yah pataa chalaa ki nishane daagne ke liye unhen chunaa gaya he to unka cheharaa khil uthaa
 Dhanoa is considered to be an expert in planning such strikes and was also one of those who were assigned the responsibility of planning a strike on Pakistan after the 2001 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir Assembly
 tab unhen laga tha ki sashastr balon or bhartiya khufia agenciyon ke bich aisi soochnaaon ke bare main koi talmail nahin he
 The intelligence officer had informed him of the camp and told how to reach there on foot
 dhanoa yaad karte hai ki unhone tab kaha tha, ''aap mujhase kya chaahate ho, vahaan kisi restaraan main jaaun or lunch karun? hamen bhugolic sthitiyon kii jaankaree chahie, jiske jariye ham vahaan hawaii hamale kar saken
 "eighteen years later, he was happy to learn that India's intelligence gathering technology has changed drastically
" dhanoa or unki team khufia agenciyon ke jutaaye balakot parisar ke baarik byoron se kaaphi khush thi
 These fine details, along with high resolution satellite photographs of the camp, would prove to be important to their pilots during the attack
 pradhanmantri se hari jhandi milane ke baad vaayu sena ke aalaa adhikariyon kii ek team or khufia agenciyon ke pramukh adhikari roj-roj baithken karne lage or hawaii hamale kii baarikiyaan taiyaar karne lage
 Pakistan was already on high alert because Prime Minister Modi was constantly proclaiming in public meetings that he would definitely teach a lesson to the culprits of the Pulwama attack
 balakot main chaynit nishane par strike ke liye vaayu sena ko yah aashwast karnaa tha ki oparation gupachup, achaanak or teji se ho
 Therefore, according to the plan, the Air Force increased the night air patrol in Jammu and Srinagar to some extent so that Pakistan would not be exposed to any unnatural aerial activity
 strike kaa vakt chunane main yah bhi dhyaan rakhaa gaya ki bangaluru air sho 20 farvari se 24 farvari tak jari tha
 During this time India did not want to strike it due to many high level international celebrities
 duusari vajah yah thi ki balakot main 25 taarikh se rangarut pahunch rahe the
 So the next day was a great time to strike at the camp
 vaayu sena ke varisht adhikariyon ne strike kii raat tak aisi phija banaae rakhi ki sab kuch aam dinon jaisaa he taaki pakistani khufia agenciyon ko koi bhanak na lage
 On the evening of the 25th, Dhanoa attended the farewell ceremony of Chandrashekharan Hari Kumar, the chief of the Western Air Command
 haalanki hari kumaar strike ko anjaam dene vaale team kii aguai kar rahe the, phir bhi yah tay kiya gaya ki vidaai samaaroh yojit kiya jaae taaki uske radd hone se pakistan ko koi bhanak na lage
 At around 10 pm, Dhanoa reached home and started monitoring the strike
 dilli main tab barish ho rahi thi or unhen chintaa thi ki balakot main bhi mausam kharaab hoga
 But luckily the sky was clear there
 yahi nahin, vahaan chandani raat thi
 The strike time was chosen around 3 am as people would be in deep sleep at various campuses
 yojana sidhi-saadi lekin behad chaturaai bhari thi
 The strike required a dozen Mirage 2000 aircraft, including the Spice (smart Precise Impact and Cost Effective) 2000 bombs manufactured in Israel
 ye bam vimaan main jeepies or ek camere ke jariye ek gidence system se nishane par sateek waar kar sakate hai
 They can kill up to 60 km
 miraj vimaanon ko kathith taur par chaar sukhoi-30 vimaan air cover muhaiyaa kara rahe the
 In addition, two reconnaissance aircraft, the Israeli Falcon Airborne and Control System and Netra were also playing their role
 isi tarah hawa main eendhan bharne ke liye do iel-76 vimaan bhi saath main the
 The Pakistani Air Force did not get any inkling, so these aircraft were flown from the bases of Agra and Bareilly
 inhen dilli ke upar se uduya tha isliye vaayu sena ne air trephic control ko aagaah kiya ki hawa main ek andhera coridor muhaiyaa karaayaa jaae, taaki ye vimaan bina kisi pahchaan ke ud saken
 When these aircraft reached the skies of Pakistan, it was cautioned that a fleet was seen heading towards Bahawalpur
 pakistan ne yah sochaa ki bhartiya vaayu sena ke jet jaish ke mukhyalay kii ore bad rahe hai, unhen rokane ke liye us ore vimaan uda diya
 It was from this deception that the Mirage 2000 fleet, which was flying down a few miles, moved towards Balakot
 jab tak pakistani radar par ve dikhte, ye vimaan pakistani jet se 150 kimi aage bad gaye
 The Mirage planes then identified the camp target and fired Spice bombs
 strike or uske baadapaanch bam nishane par gire
 Three large residences fell on the campus, where there were 150 recruits
 ek you ke aakaar vaale mukhya parisar par gira, jahaan zyaadaatar jaish ke netaa the or paanchvaan us imaarat par gira, jisamen ustad trainer the
 One target could not strike and that was the school lying vacant, in which Yusuf Azhar lived
 vajah yah thi ki jis vimaan ko us par hamalaa karnaa tha vah nishchit avadhi main nishaanaa nahin saadh sakaa
 All aircraft returned safely to their respective destinations the same night
 dobhaal ke alaava, dhanoa ne sena or nausena ke pramukhon ko soochna di ki mishan puraa ho gaya
 All the three parts of the army were on high alert as they were ready for any retaliation from Pakistan
 sab kuch surakshit sampann ho gaya, yah jaanakar modi tadake chaar baje yoga karne chale gaye
 Finally 11 in the afternoon
 30 baje hi bhartiya adhikariyon ko pataa chalaa ki hawaii hamalaa kiya gaya he
 Foreign Secretary Vijay Keshav Gokhale read a small statement and confirmed that the Indian fighter jets attacked Jaish's training camp in Balakot and a large number of trainers and fidayeen were killed in this 'non-military precautionary action'
 
 pakistan ne bharat kii strike kii kamyaabi ke daawey kaa purajor khandan kiya or agle din bhartiya nishaanon par strike karne ke liye jet vimaanon kaa ek bedaa bheja
 In response, the Indian Air Force flew their aircraft and in their fight Pakistani aircraft fired on a mig-21 Bison aircraft, which fell into the pok
 uske payalat wing commander abhinandan vardhaman pakad liye gaye
 They landed there with the help of parachutes
 idhar bharat ne daawa kiya ki usne ek pakistani epa-16 vimaan ko bhi maar giraaya he
 But Pakistan denied it
 pakistan ne abhinandan ko 48 ghante baad hi lautaa diya to donon desh yuddh kii ashankaon se peeche laut aae lekin apni sena ko haai alert par rakhaa
 The Indian Air Force is confident that Abhinandan shot down the F-16 aircraft before it could leave the aircraft as it was clearly visible on the surveillance radar that it was going down
 pakistan ne vah malba dikhaaya, jo uske mutabik mig-21 kaa ingine tha
 However, after taking a closer look at that picture and comparing the old mig-21 engine at the Pathankot airport, the Indian Air Force presented evidence to the government that the debris was not the mig-21 but more likely the F-16
 (dekhen kya epa-16 ko maar giraaya)
 In the days following the attack, the sentence reached a height
 strike main kitne log maare gaye, isaki koi aadhikarik jaankaree nahin hone se rajnatik netaaon ke kayaas hawa main gunjane lage
 BJP President Amit Shah said that 250 people were killed in the Jaish Kekamp
 vipakshi partiyon ne maang kii ki modi sarkaar hawaii hamale ke 'pukhta' saboot dikhaae
 The Air Force may have two methods of confirming bombing of targets
 kisi vimaan main laga synthetic epperchar radar, jo raat main nishane kii tasviir le sake, chaahe badali hi kyon na chai ho or bam daagne ke pehle or uske baad nishane kii tasviir bhej sake, jisase vaayu sena ke daawey kii pushti ho
 Secondly, the optical satellite picture is somewhat blurred as it was cloudy above Balakot for several days
 is bich antarrashtriya samachar agenciyon or research ne aise satellite pikchar prakaash main laae jisamen lakshith camp kaa kuch nuksaan nahin dikh rahaa he
 India Today was shown a high-resolution satellite picture available with the Indian Air Force, which clearly shows that there are three holes on the roof of a building
 yah spice bam ke hamale kaa tarika he
 Yet these doubts remain as to how many Jaish people were killed in the strike
 bhartiya khufia agenciyon ke mutabik, us ilaake main mobile par hui baatcheet ko tap karne se pataa chalaa he ki strike ke kuch ghante baad sthaneey police thane ne 3 ambulance kii baat darj kii, jo camp se 35 shav lekar aa rahi thi
 Secondly, 37 ambulances were also seen going towards that
 ye bhi khabaren hai ki abtabad aspataal main kuch marijon kaa ilaaj hua lekin in khabaron kii khufia agenciyon ne tasdik nahin kii
 Recently India Today TV conducted a sting operation in which several people in the areas around Balakot confirmed the deaths in the air strike
 pakistan ne camp ke chaaron ore gheraabandi kar rakhi he or kisi ko us ilaake main jane kii ijaajat nahin he
 This also gave rise to these doubts that much was being hidden
 zyaadaatar jaankaron kaa yahi kahana he ki maut ke sahi aankadon ke baahar aane main kuch samay lagegaa
 However, there is no doubt that by striking in Balakot, India has given a clear message that it is no longer easy for Pakistan to foment terror
 use anjaam bhi bhugatna hoga
 However, only history will tell whether the Balakot attack was able to teach Pakistan a lesson in India from its nefarious ways
 do duusare nishaanon ke badale balakot kaa chunaav isliye kiya gaya kyonki vah pakistan kii mukhya bhoomi main he or vahaan sena yaa aam logon ko kisi tarah kii janomal kaa khatra nahin rahegadoorgaami asarbhartiya vaayu sena ke mutabik, usne balakot mishan kamyaabi ke saath puraa kiya or vishesh bamon ke hawaii hamale se baaki janomal kii nuksaan nahin hone diyachhedstrike main istemaal kiye gaye 5 spice 2000 bamon main se 3 ek building kii chat se ghuse, jinase chhed ban gaye (artist kii prastuti)hathiyaaraijrael main nirmit spice 2000 ek hajaar kilo ke bam ko 'smart' hathiyaar main badal detaa he
 These are stand-off weapons

 The spiked part pierces any structure and explodes inside it and destroys the target
 Explosion 'dago and Run' The bomb pierces the roof and goes inside the house and explodes a little later with the help of the explosion
 There was a lot of risk in the use of air force, but the Prime Minister was clear that India had to take astonishing action, the sixth bomb was also to be dropped on the ramp
 But the jet aircraft could not be targeted in due time
 Was the F-16 shot down? The Indian Air Force claims that its mig-21 shot down an F-16 on February 27
 The Hiro Pilot Air Force believes the wing commander Abhinandan's mig The F-16 aircraft shot down a missile before the 21-bison fell, according to the Air Force, the mig-21 is not the flat part shown in the photo

 After that, the money comes out and the ATM is closed when the money runs out in the afternoon
 notebandi ke baad se yahaan roj ke yahi haal hai
 2 lakh rupees are put in a day, which can be done only for the evacuation of 100 people
 lihaaja har koi subah jaldi aa kar apni baari kaa intazaar karata he
 By the way, there are 2 bank atms in Jayapur, one Syndicate Bank and the other Union Bank
 union bank kaa atm 3 dinon se note kii kami kii vajah se band he lihaaja sara bhaar sindicket bank par he
 It is worth noting that there are accounts of about 8 thousand people in Union Bank of village Jayapur for adoption of the Prime Minister
 yah bank agal bagal ke 10 kilometre ke daayre ke gaanv ke logon ko banking suvidha detaa he
 Hence the line of people here is also long
 philhal bank main sthiti ab dhire dhire saamaanya hi rahi he lekin note nikasi main abhi bhi logon ko pareshaani he
 The government is talking about cashless
 sarkaar card se lenden ke chalan ko badhanaa chaahati he lekin gaanv main isko lekar bahut sanshay he
 One is that people are not so knowledgeable about it and secondly they are afraid that due to lack of awareness, they can steal their money fraudulently
 aisi kahani bhi gaanv main sunne ko mili lihaaja log abhi usase bachanaa chaah rahe hai
 In such a situation, the government has major challenges for cashless economy
 ab dekhne vaali baat ye hogi ki wo isse kaise nipatati he

 If the name of flying Punjab is not right, then keep flying flying
 punjab kii jagah pehlaaj kar dene se do baaten hongi
 Anwar and b will fly away

 Together with B, the quantity of b and Aa will be met

 Central Board of Film Certification
 hindi main kendriya film pramann board
 Ideally, it should be named Central Film Certification Board after certification
 yani jo film aegi use ham kaant chhaant kar phir se bana kar denge
 i am angry with those who have angrily called Pahlaj Nihalani ineligible
 main hameshaa se pro-ayogy rahaa hum yani ayogy samarthak
 If the country remains in the hands of only deserving people, then what will be done by so many inept
 is desh ke kai rajyon main board kii pariksha main pachaas fisadi chaatr fail ho jate hai
 These failures happen because no one thinks about them before they fail
 kam se kam fail hone ke baad to inke bare main sochaa jaae
 Many of these millions of students who have failed from the board go on to become chairman of all types of boards
 at: ayogyata sthaayee nahin hoti
 Worthy was also unfit - anyone can make a serial with this name
 nihlani ne anuraag kashyap ko jawaab dene ke naam par sarkaar kii mehnat par pani pher diya
 Till now, the minister was saying that the government has no role in blowing up Udta Punjab to Punjab
 “maine suna he ki anuraag kashyap ne is film ke liye aam aadmi party se paise liye hai”
 Is Pahlaj Nihalani not expressing political motive behind the board's decision with this matter
 ye to pataa chal gaya ki pehlaaj nihlani sirf film nahin dekhte balki film ke bare main kya kya baaten kahi ja rahi hai wo bhi sunate hai! ye kya kam he ki pehlaaj sahab suni sunai baton kii kaant-chhaant nahin karte
 Believe in whatever you hear! “agar main bharat ke pradhanmantri kaa chamachaa nahin hum to kya main italy ke pradhanmantri kaa chamachaa hum”
 "yes, i am the spoon of Modi as Anurag Kashyap has said"
 pehlaaj nihlani kii in baton se pradhanmantri ko bhi jhatka na lag jaae
 He made a video film titled 'mera Desh Hai Mahan' in November 2015, in which children call Prime Minister Modi Modi
 kaaka kahana bilkul thik he jabatak ki bijepi se koi yah sawaal na kar de ki kahin ye chachaa nehru kii nakal to nahin he
 Thankfully, it did not go unnoticed
 sara vivaad is par tha ki isamen videshon ke seen dikhaakar bharat ke bataaye gaye hai
 But if the head of a statutory board says that i am Modi's spoon, in my opinion, he is betting on the credit of the Prime Minister
 aaj kal itani mehnat se yah prachaar ho rahaa he ki puri saraakaar kis kadar peshewar tareeke se kaam karti he
 From the words of Pahlaj, it seems that in the Modi government there is also a question of spoon
 video ke vivaad ke vakt bhi pehlaaj kah chuke hai ki mujhe chamachagiri par garv he
 It seems that they are not able to free themselves from the frame of Chamchagiri
 ve khud udana nahin chaahate hai isliye udata punjab se punjab uda diya
 The minister is saying that the government has no role in the work of the board
 board ke mukhiya kah rahe hai ki main bharat ke pradhanmantri kaa chamachaa hum
 It is more a matter of concern than the flying Punjab dispute that Pahlaj Nihalani should be removed as chairman
 videsh yatra par gaye pradhanmantri ke peeche agar unke mantri yaa sansthaaon ke mukhiya yah bolne lagen ki ham unke chamache hai to desh-duniya main unki kya chhavi rah jaaegi
 Did the opposition paste the label of Chamcha Raj on the Modi government? Therefore, the heads of the institutions should also give answers within their scope
 unke paas kuch bhi bolne kii chhot nahin he
 If they can use their freedom of expression unlimitedly, then by what right are flying scissors on Punjab
 meri raay main pehlaaj sahab is tarah se bhi kah sakate the ki main pradhanmantri modi main vishwaas rakhata hum
 The Prime Minister is the leader of the country, so is my leader
 pehlaaj ne acchhee filmein nahin banaain to kya hua
 Had he even read some scripts of style in Hindi, he would not have used such language in connection with the Prime Minister
 jab aap khud ko kisi kaa chamachaa kehete hai to aap uskaa to nuksaan karte hi hai jiskaa chamachaa hone kaa aap elaan karte hai, saath hi aap apane virodhiyon kii wo baat sabit kar dete hai ki aap yogya nahin hai
 The comments pehlaaj ne kaha he ki punjab chunaavon ke kaaran udata punjab main kaant-chhaant nahin kii gai he
 According to him, if one watches the entire film, he can understand why the word Punjab has been deleted
 kitni kushi kii baat he
 Is not it! After blowing the name and scene, he has also left a film worth knowing why he was diligent in Punjab
 baharhaal udata punjab kii jagah aap dekhte rahiye udata pehlaaj
 Pahlaj saheb does not like to be called a dictator, yes he definitely likes to call himself Chamcha
 central board of film certification
 Central Board of Film Certification in Hindi
 kaayade se iskaa naam hona chahie kendriya kaant-chhaant uparant film pramann board
 That is, the film that will come, we will trim it and make it again
 jin logon ne gusse main pehlaaj nihlani ko ayogy kaha he main unase naaraaz hum
 i have always been pro-disqualified
 desh sirf yogya logon ke haath main rahegaa to itane saare ayogy kya jhaal bajaaenge
 In many states of this country, fifty percent of students fail in the board exams
 ye fail isliye hote hai kyonki fail hone se pehle koi inke bare main nahin sochataa he
 At least after failure, they should be thought about
 board se fail hue inhen lakhon chaatro main se kai aage chalakar tamaam tarah ke board ke chairman ban jate hai
 Therefore, disqualification is not permanent
 yogya bhi kabhi ayogy tha- is naam se chaahe to koi siriyal bana saktaa he
 Nihalani blamed the government's hard work in the name of replying to Anurag Kashyap
 abhi tak mantri kah rahe the ki udata punjab se punjab uda dene main sarkaar kii koi bhoomika nahin he
 "I heard that Anurag Kashyap has taken money from the Aam Aadmi Party for this film"
 kya pehlaaj nihlani apni is baat se board ke faisle ke peeche raajnneetik manshaa zaahir nahin kar rahe hai
 It has come to know that Pahlaj Nihalani not only watches the film but also listens to what are being said about the film! What is it less that Pahlaj sahib Sunni does not cut things heard
 jo bhi sunate hai us par yakeen kar lete hai! "if i am not the spoon of the Prime Minister of India, am i the spoon of the Prime Minister of Italy"
 “haa main modi kaa chamachaa hum jaisaa anuraag kashyap ne kaha he”
 These things of Pahlaj Nihalani should not shock even the Prime Minister
 unhone november 2015 main ‘meraa desh he mahaan’ naam se ek video film banaai thi, jisamen bachche pradhanmantri modi ko modi kaaka pukaarte hai
 Kaka is absolutely right to say until someone asks the BJP whether this uncle is a copy of Nehru
 ganimat he ki is par dhyaan nahin gaya
 The whole controversy was over that India has been told by showing scenes from abroad
 magar kisi vaidhanik board kaa mukhiya yah kahe ki main modi kaa chamachaa hum to meri raay main wo pradhanmantri kii saakh par batta laga rahaa he
 Nowadays, with so much hard work, it is being propagated how professionally the whole work works
 pehlaaj kii baton se lagata he ki modi sarkaar main chamachon kii bhi puch he
 Even during the video controversy, Pahlaj has said that i am proud of Chamchagiri
 aisa lagata he ki ve khud ko chamachagiri ke frem se azaad nahin kara paa rahe hai
 They themselves do not want to fly, so Udta flew from Punjab to Punjab
 mantri kah rahe hai ki board ke kaam main sarkaar kii bhoomika nahin he
 The head of the board is saying that i am the spoon of the Prime Minister of India
 kaayade se udata punjab vivaad se zyada ye sangeen maamla banataa he ki pehlaaj nihlani ko chairman ke pad se hataa diya jaae
 After the Prime Minister who has gone abroad, if his ministers or heads of institutions start saying that we are his spoon, then what will be his image in the country and the world
 kahin vipaksh ne modi sarkaar par chamachaa raaj kaa label chipka diya to? isliye sansthaaon ke pramukhon ko jawaab bhi apane daayre main dena chahie
 They do not have the freedom to speak anything
 agar ve apni abhivyakti kii swatantraaa kaa aseemit istamaal kar sakate hai to phir kis haq se udata punjab par kanchi chalaa rahe hai
 In my opinion, Pahlaj saheb could also say that i believe in Prime Minister Modi
 pradhanmantri desh ke netaa hai, isliye mere bhi netaa hai
 What happened if Pahlaj did not make good films
 hindi main dhang kii kuch screept bhi padhi hoti to ve pradhanmantri se jod kar aisi bhashaa kaa istemaal nahin karte
 When you call yourself someone's spoon, you do damage to that which you proclaim to be a spoon, as well as you prove to your opponents that you are not worthy
 tippaniyan Pahlaj has said that Udta Punjab has not been cut because of Punjab elections
 unke anusaar agar koi puri film dekhegaa to vahi samaj saktaa he ki punjab shabd ko kyon dilit kiya gaya he
 What a pleasure
 he na! naam or seen udaane ke baad unhone kisi ko pataa lagane laayak film ko choda bhi he ki punjab kyon dilit kiya
 However, instead of flying Punjab, you should keep watching Udta Pahlaj
 pehlaaj sahab ko dictator kahlaana pasand nahin, haa ve khud ko chamachaa kahlaana zarur pasand karte hai

 notebandi par sarkaar ko gherne vaale vipaksh par palatwaar karte hue kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki desh ko eemaandaar banane ke liye notebandi kii gai
 The whole country stands with the government
 choron par sarkaar kii sakhti se rahul or unke saathi pareshaan hai
 Ravi Shankar said that Congress is the most corrupt party and Rahul Gandhi lacks maturity
 vipaksh kii ekajutata pararavishankar ne kahaaki hamane rahul gandhi kaa flop sho dekha he
 In 16, eight parties could gather
 jald hi 8 bhi jayega or uske baad rahul akele batch paaenge or vilaap karenge
 The opposition unity balloon has burst
 bhrashtachar karne vaale dalon kii sthiti haasyaaspad he
 2G, coal, fodder and Sarada were asking questions on Modiji and demonetisation
 rahul tab khamosh the, jab prithvi ke har ang main bhrashtachar chal rahaa tha
 Mayawati also retaliated; after the allegations of BSP supremo Mayawati, the BJP hit back at Mayawati
 ravishankar prasad ne mayawati ke aaropon ko nakaarte hue kaha ki pradhanmantri par lagaae mayawati ke aarope puri tarah bebuniyaad or nindaneey hai
 BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said that why she was shocked by the investigation of the money she deposited after demonetisation
 kya mayawati apane bhrashtachar ko daliton ke naam par chupaana chaahati hai
 He said that Mayawati is insulting Dalits
 bijepi ne mayawati se sawaal poocha he ki jamaa karai gai rakam party ke chande kii he yaa notebadali ke jariye paisa jamaa karaayaa gaya he
 The Law Minister said that the law will do its job
 He should reply, but what does it mean for the PM and National President Amit Shah to make derogatory remarks
 ravishankar prasad ne mayawati par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki bispi isiilie hi notebandi kaa virodh kar rahi he
 Prasad said that BJP has not said anything yet it is only media report then why is Mayawati so upset
 upi vidhansabha chunaav par ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki rajya main kisi dal kaa gathbandhan bane, janata man bana chuki he
 Remember also Mayawati Lok Sabha Elections 2014, we trust the people of UP
 bijepi ne mayawati se sawaal kiya ki unhen apane parivaar ke bijness ke bare main bataanaa chahie or dalit vikaas ko bhrashtachar kaa paryaay nahin bananaa chahie
 When asked about the bjp's donation in the press conference, the BJP leader said that every political party gives accounts to the Election Commission, we have also given and will give it further
 saath hi bijepi apana hisaab chunaav ayog ko degi or chunaav ayog ise apni website par daalega
 He said that the case is under investigation and he does not want to comment on Mayawati's family by name

 The case of the rape of a Dalit student studying in Kerala after the rape was not even cold enough that a Dalit student studying in nursing was gang-raped by three people
 maamle ko gambhirtha se lete hue police ne fouran maamla darj kar karrwai shuru kar di
 This shameful incident of mass rape took place in Ayanthi of Darsham Varkala on Tuesday
 ek sthaneey police adhikari ne bataaya ki ladki kii shikaayat ke aadhaar par teen logon ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya gaya he or jaanch shuru ho gai he
 According to police, a 19-year-old student studying in the second year of BSC nursing had gone in an autorickshaw
 yah chaalak chaatra kii pahchaan vaala tha
 Later, two friends of the driver also boarded the auto
 ve log autoricshaw ko ek sunsaan sthaan par le gaye
 And there the three gang-raped the girl
 ladki ke cheekhney chillane kii awaz sunakar kuch log ghatnasthal kii taraf daude
 They found the girl lying there dumb
 ladki gahare sadame kii haalat main pahunch gai thi or use daure pad rahe the
 They immediately informed Pulik about this and the victim was admitted to the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College Hospital
 police ne ladki ke bayaan lene ke baad teen logon ke khilaaf mukadmaa darj kar liya he
 Police is searching for the accused
 abhi tak aaropee police kii pahunch se baahar hai
 Significantly, a few days before this incident, a Dalit student studying law in Ernakulam district was raped and then murdered
 is ghatana ko lekar soobe kii raajnneeti bhi garma gai thi
 The situation at Karipur airport became strange on Wednesday night when a violent clash broke out between the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and the Airport Authority of India officer
 is ghatana main jahaan CISF ke ek jawan kii maut ho gai, vahiin kam se kam teen airport karmchaaree ghayal ho gaye
 According to the information, the dispute took place when the officer of the fire department of the Airport Authority had a debate with the CISF jawan regarding the security investigation
 iske baad donon ke bich hathapayee ho gai or phir naubat goli chalaane tak pahunch gai he
 The young man died after being shot
 kerala ke grih mantri ramesh chennithalaa nesiepake jawan kii maut kii pushti karte hue bataaya ki atirikt police mahanideshak (uttar) shankar reddy ghatnasthal ke liye ravaanaa ho gaye hai
 The Superintendent of Police of Malapuram has also reached the spot and has started talks with the CISF personnel

 -input language jab devilal 1990 main veepi singh sarkaar ko todane par amada the, mashhoor cartoonist abu abraham ne apane cartoon main aise bail ko pesh kiya jo apni hi dukaan main todfod kar rahaa he (angreji muhaavarey bul in china shop kii tarj par)
 i was such a junior journalist at that time that i did not have much access to the corridors of politics, but if i knew Devi Lal and also knew my Haryanvi people then i am sure that he would not have considered it bad
 iske badale ve yah dekhakar chaunke honge ki kisi-kisi charchaa he
 The most loved of any Haryanvi are her cattle
 devilal ke to yakeenan the
 Them r
 venkataraman ne president estate ke saath nai dilli ke willingdon kriscent (jo ab madrateresa kriscent ho gaya he) main bada bangala dilvaaya tha
 Devi Lal transformed his beautiful garden into a fence of over a hundred cattle
 jo bhi ho, unhone abu ke us tanj ko shaayad hi samajha hoga
 And they were engaged in overthrowing the VP Singh government
 yah kahani sirf isiilie yaad nahin ai ki haryana main bijepi sarkaar kii ek nai pahal se gaay, bail, sand or bachade vagairah rashtiya surkhiyon main chaa gaye hai
 The Haryana government is going to pass a new law for cow protection in Haryana Legislative Protection and Gosavardhan Bill (also uncontested)
 vajah yah bhi nahin he ki nae kanoon se rajya main koi khaas ho-hallaa machane vaala he, jahaan saamaajik-aarthik or jati abhijatya birdari (jat, brahman, baniyaa) zyaadaatar shaakaahaari he or jahaan isai nammaatr ke hai tathaa musalmaan ek jile tak simit hai
 Now the state police will have a thick baton of the new black law to stop all of us 'mothers' from taking us to the slaughterhouse and exporting
 asal main yah danda or daraavna he
 For example, if you keep, sell or eat canned beef products brought from elsewhere, you can be punished even more than killing someone
 agar main gudgaanv yaa uske aasapaas sthit kisi korian yaa japani company kaa echaar pramukh hota to apane sabhi adhikariyon ko swadesh laut jane ko kahata or yah bhi hidaayat detaa ki jane ke pehle apane refricrator ko puri tarah saaf kar den taaki baad main koi suraag na mil paae
 All restaurants, bars and a variety of new five-star hotels in Gurgaon will also have a list of restrictions on catering in the form of catering
 vaise bhi aap haryana main bif kii khapat kaaphi kam pate hai
 That is, our fridge and dining table can also smell crime
 aise main ham hariyaanvi logon ko duniyabar main gobhakti ke liye nahin, balki, main kuch dar ke saath kahuun to, bail jaisaa dimag hone ke liye janaa jayega
 Then, see the interesting aspect of this law
 yah sirf desi gaayon kii hi raksha karata he
 So, isn't Jersey a restriction? And is artificial insemination still valid for purifying blood? This week's argument is not about the fundamental right to eat beef or the rise of vegetarian terrorism in the BJP regime, where cheese would be the ideal food
 jis desh main, anthropological survey kii report (1993) ke mutabik, bharat ke log 4,635 samudaayon main 88 pratishat maansaahaari hai, jisamen ham bhi shaamil kiye ja sakate hai
 This plea is about the unimaginable composure of BJP governments, which is giving attention to the opponents by giving them an opportunity to lick their tongues
 yah party gaayon se lekar isaayiyon, iity se lekar samvedansheel kanoonon ke maamle main adhyadesh, munhjor sadhvi kaa hamaare voting ke rujhaan par ashobhaneey bayaan or ab ek viechpi netaa kaa 1857 ke swatantraaa sangram ko sampradayik rang dene kii koshish
 i do not know how many such fronts are opening in which there is a great risk of losing its own political capital
 philhal haryana kii hi charchaa kii jaae kyonki yahi vah rajya he jahaan bijepi apni us raah se bhatakati ja rahi he jise usne puure desh main dikhaaya tha
 Cows will be counted in Haryana, collars will be placed for identification
 meraa khyaal he ki is maamle main bhi kuch nae vichaar aaenge
 For example, an app like Nirbhaya will be installed in cell phones so that cows can warn the police control room as soon as they see danger
 or puraane kism ke bahaane bhi nahin chalenge, jaise mujhe laga ki yah bhens kaa gosht yaa matan kebab he
 The reason is that under the new law, there will be laboratories for testing meat in Haryana
 jaraa sochie, jis desh main manushyon kii forencik jaanch kii mukammal vyavastha nahin he ki sunanda tharur kii mrityu ke saal bhar baad unki bisraa report kaa ab bhi america se aane kaa intjaar he, kyonki abhi pichley maheene dilli police ke ek disipi uske namoonay lekar gaye hai
 Gaushalas will be formed in one state of that country and an entire police force will be created to protect stray cows and collect meat samples from slaughterhouses, shops, hotels in Gurgaon
 gudganvamen badi sankhya main videshi jo rahete hai
 This police will also register an FIR on 'mataavadh'
 nunatam sarkaar, adhiktam sushasan kaa aisa vichaar to kisi kaa nahin he
 The country's most prosperous, rapidly urbanizing state needs police to control crimes against women, excesses of the Khap Panchayat and saints like Rampal
 vahaan yah nayaa kanoon haasyaaspad hi lagata he
 No pracharak has ever succeeded in coming to power
 ise narendra modi par lagu na karen kyonki gujarat ke unke record or 2014 main unke vaadon ne hamen aashwast kiya he ki apni vichaardhaara se ve bhale abhi bhi bandhe hon, lekin ve puraatanapanthi vichaaron se aage bad gaye hai
 We can still surmise that for the first time when the state, which is highly politicized in politics on the promise of technology and production-based development and jobs of Modi, chose BJP for the first time, who handed over the throne to an unknown campaigner
 vahaan ke logon ne to gaay se bhi pavitra aresas ko satta main laane ke liye mol-tol nahin kiya tha
 Yet within a few months of coming to power, this government is becoming an inspiration for the whatsapp
 jaahir he, vahaan kaa samaaj chota or apane main behatar judaa hua samaaj he jo duniya main sabase umdaa prajati kii apni bhainson par fakhr karata he or bhens kaa doodh pikar vahaan ke adhikansh shaakaahaari pahalwaan, boxr or athlete desh ke baaki hisse ke logon se zyada antarrashtriya padak batorte hai
 Not only this, they also know to laugh very loudly on their mistakes
 shaayad ab bhi unke dimag main aisa hi kuch chal rahaa hoga
 Haryana was the last non-bjp state to vote for the government in the name of Modi
 usne aresas khap panchayat jaisi kisi sarkaar ke liye vot to nahin diya tha
 The society here is of devout Hindus where there is no particular history of communal passions or riots
 vahaan aresas ko bantwaare ke baad yahaan ke shaharon main aa based punjabi 'sharnaarthiyon' kaa shagal mana jaataa rahaa he
 There has been a very strong stream of Arya Samaj movement in the state
 yahaan se 1977 main secular dalon se swami agnivesh or adityavesh chune gaye
 The Arya Samaj here is purist but never expresses its expression
 beshak, agar aresas kii manshaa prachaarak sanchalit hindu raashtra ke liye nai prayogshaala bananaa he to usne galat rajya kaa chunaav kar liya he
 Haryana is more or less a Hindu state
 darasal ham hariyaanvi apane akkhadpan ke liye jane jate hai jo kisi se—musalmaan, isai, america, chini, pakistani, hindu—nahin darataa or apni is khyaati ko ham apane dil se lagaae rahete hai
 The same thing forces us to be collectively ashamed that we do not treat our daughters well
 isse ham stri-purush anupaat ke chart main sabase neeche pahunch gaye hai
 We would love if someone helps us to change this situation, explain or pressurize us
 hamane jo sarkaar haal hi main chuni he, vah jati or saamanti vafadariyon ke puraane gaddhon ko yun hi chhodkar hamen ek vishaal gaushala main badal dena chaahati he
 We have not seen any reliable opinion poll yet
 lekin agar aapako hariyaanvi dhadkan kii thodi bhi samaj he to jaan lijie ki is sarkaar ne apane achche din kharaab kar liye hai
 Most people are cursing themselves for voting for BJP
 yah baat yogendra yadav se behatar koi nahin samajhataa
 This makes their uneasiness to spread AAP in Haryana understandable
 mujhe abhi bhi puraa yakeen nahin he ki haryana 'aap' ko vot dene ko taiyaar he, lekin itnaa tay he ki vah bijepi ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaanaa chahta he
 Modi is smart enough to understand that the electoral wave has returned
 dilli ne is tathy par muhar laga di
 Why, the party's performance in Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir has been much lower than its expectations, while the Congress has not stopped the process of breaking the pegs
 agali ladaai bihar main honi he
 Punjab and Delhi may also get results like Akali and Congress badly, provided 'AAP' finds a good candidate for a clean image, like, say, Manpreet Badal
 bina laag-lapet ke dekhen to das maheene main hi baari chunavi jeet behad 'saamaanya' lagane lagi he, thik vaise hi jaise 1984 main rajeev gandhi kii vishaal jeet dedh saal main hi maamuli lagane lagi thi
 If Modi really wants to become a big leader, then he has to give clear instructions to the RSS / VHP in two words
 aresas / viechpi ke haashie ke vichaaron kaa ab koi kharidaar nahin he
 Vajpayee had sidelined him, Modi needs to take on him
 punashchah is hafte sabase bakawaas bayaan viechpi ke mahasachiv surendra jain (yah naam aapane pehle suna he?) kaa tha
 Justifying the attack on the Church of Hisar, he said that it would continue as long as Christians continued to convert, and that the 1857 war was a crusade against Christians
 main unhen wiliam dailarimple kii kitaab da last mughal kii ek prati saunpna chahta hum
 There are many such stories in it that most of the upper caste Hindus used to be Muslim soldiers
 yah fouj naam ke 'badshah' jafar kaa mughal jhanda liye lard rahi thi
 i would like to mention a particular context from that
 jab ladaai dilli ke kareeb pahunch chuki thi tab id kaa mauka tha
 In such a situation, the commanders (all Muslims) of that army were worried that the incidents of cow slaughter could divide their army on communal basis
 isliye unhone apane kotawaalon se dugadugi bajaakar logon main yah sandesh dene ko kaha ki musalmaan gaayon ko nuksaan na pahunchaaen
 Not only this, the Kotwals hold stray cows and lock them under the protection of Kotwali of Old Delhi for not giving any chance
 is tarah 1857 kaa yuddh ek secular yuddh tha
 It has a different place in the history of India

 Special Public Prosecutor Rohini Salianne said that the matter is of trust and principles, so she wants to withdraw from all the cases related to NIA
 unhone kaha, 'jab aarope lag chuke hai, to aise main mere liye yah vishwaas kaa sawaal ban gaya he
 Earlier, Rohini Salian, a special public prosecutor in the Malegaon blast case, claimed that ever since the new government was formed at the Center, it was being pressured to take a soft stand towards the Hindu accused
 angreji akhbaar 'da indian express' ne is bare main report chhaapi he
 Rohini Salian, who was related to this famous case, had said that since the last one year since the new government came to power, pressure has been put on him by the NIA
 jaanch agency ne unhen is cese ke aropiyon ke prati 'soft' rahane ko kaha he
 Special Public Prosecutor Rohini had said that after the formation of the NDA government, he received a call from an NIA official
 jab rohinee ne phone par cese kii baat karne se inkaar kar diya, to adhikari ne unase milakar bataaya ki unhen aropiyon ke prati naram rukh apnaanaa chahie
 NIA denies the allegation

 In the first Test match against the West Indies, captain Virat Kohli did not include star batsman Rohit Sharma in the playing XI
 kohli ke is faisle ne har kisi ko hairaan kar diya
 Following the decision of Captain Kohli, questions are arising whether Virat kept Rohit out of the playing eleven due to mutual differences
 bataa den ki rohit sharma shandaar form main chal rahe hai
 Rohit Sharma scored a brilliant 68 in the practice match played before the Test series
 rohit ke is pradarshan ko nazarandaaj karte hue viraat ne unhen plaing ilevan main shaamil nahin kiya
 Captain Virat Kohli has preferred Hanuma Vihari over Rohit Sharma
 bhartiya captain ke is faisle se prashansak kaaphi naaraaz lag rahe hai
 There were reports of mutual differences between Rohit and Virat since the defeat in the World Cup 2019 semi-finals

 Azam Khan was prevented from addressing the election rally for 72 hours by the Election Commission due to an outlandish statement against Jayaprada
 ajam khan ne shuukravaar ko kaha, 'meri tabiyat kharaab he

 ) bahucharchit lokapal vidheyak guuruuvaar ko loksabhaa main pesh kiya jayega
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal gave this information
 bansal ne bataaya ki chunki sabhi dal is vidheyak ko jald se jald sadan main pesh karne ke liye sahamat he isliye carmik rajya mantri ve narayansami ne loksabhaa adhyaksh mira kumaar se anurodh kiya he ki nae vidheyak kii prati ko raajnneetik dalon main vitarit karne ke liye anivaary do din kii avadhi ko maaf kiya jaae taaki ise guuruuvaar ko sadan main pesh kiya ja sake
 The draft Lokpal Bill was approved by the Cabinet last week
 pradhanmantri ke pad ko iske daayre se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 However, he will be under the purview of the post of Prime Minister
 lokapal vidheyak 2011 ke masaude ke tahat pradhanmantri, ucch nyaaypalika or sansad ke bheetar saansadon ke aacharan ko prastaavit bhrashtachar nirodhi nikaay ke daayre se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 There are sharp differences with the Gandhian Anna Hazare side of the government on all these three issues
 haalanki, iske alaava hazaare paksh kii ore se sujhaaye gaye 40 binduon main se 34 ko sarkaar ne is masaude main shaamil karne kaa daawa kiya he
 According to the draft, the Lokpal will have a chairman and eight other members

 The Lokpal will have its own investigation unit and prosecution unit
 baharhaal, lokapal ko abhiyojan chalaane ke adhikaar nahin honge
 The judiciary will have the right to prosecute
 soshal media par ganatantr diwas ke avasar par ek photo kaaphi charchaa main he, us photo main yah dikhaaya gaya he ki parade ke dauraan guard aaf honor ke dauraan uparashtrapati hamid ansaari ne sailyut kyon nahin kiya
 The RSS has tweeted this photo and why the Vice President did not salute the national flag
 is baat ko yahaan saaf karnaa bahut jaruri he ki sachai kya he or salaami ke niyam kya kehete hai
 Because those who do not know the rules of salute, they will not hesitate to insult the Vice President on social media
 sailyut ke niyam ke anusaar "jhanda fahraane, jhanda jhukaane yaa parade ke dauraan salaami lene ke dauraan, vahaan maujuud sabhi log jhande kii taraf munh kiye rahenge or saavdhaan kii mudra main khadey honge tathaa raashtrapati (teenon sena ke pramukh) or vardi main maujuud log salaami denge
 When the flag is passing in front of you during the parade, all the people present there can stand in careful posture or can also give salute
 yani ye anivaary nahin he
 Any dignitary can salute, even if his head is not covered
 
 "so this is the rule of salute
 magar, soshal media par ek photo ko lekar kisi kii bhi dhajjiyaan uda sakate hai, lekin ek baat nahin bhulani chahie ki uparashtrapati hamid ansaari koi nae nahin he
 This is his second term as Vice President and he knows these rules well
 iske pehle bhi wo diplomet rahe hai, kai deshon main rajdoot rah chuke hai or yah unka ganatantr diwas kii parade main uparashtrapati ke taur par 8waan saal he
 That is, before accusing anyone, it should be decided what the rule says
 raashtra dhvaj ke saath logon kii samvednaa samaj main aati he, magar kisi bhi bhartiya ke liye yah samajhnaa ki wo aap se kam apane jhande kaa sammaan karata he, us vyakti kaa apmaan hi karnaa hoga
 By the way, another photo is going on tweeter showing that the Prime Minister is sitting when President Pranab Mukherjee is giving Ashok Chakra to the widow of Major Mukund Varadarajan
 yahaan phir yah saaf kar duun ki kahin bhi nahin likhaa he yaa parampara he ki pradhanmantri ko khadaa hi hona he
 So the Prime Minister is right here, just as the Vice President was right during the parade
 magar dikkat ye he ki uparashtrapati hamid ansaari kaa photo soshal media par trend kar rahaa he or pradhanmantri kaa nahin
 What i meant to write was to tell people about the Qaeda, which they may not be aware of
 vaise soshal media par ansoshal bahes kaa chalanaa hi is media kii safalataa he

 pakistan ke purv raashtrapati parvej musharraf (pervez Musharraf) ne ek intervyuu main sweekaar kiya ki jammu-kashmir main bhartiya sena ke khilaaf ladane ke liye kashmiriyon ko mujahiddeen banane kii training pakistan main di gai

 unhone osama bin laden (osama bin Laden), ayman al-jawahiri, jilaluddin hakkaani or anya aatankiyon ko bhi pakitsani "nayakon" kii sangya di
 Let us tell you that Pakistan leader Farhatullah Babar shared an interview of Pervez Musharraf on his Twitter account on Wednesday, in which he has been saying, "those Kashmiris who come to Pakistan are welcomed here like a hero

 We consider him a Mujahideen who fights against the Indian Army
 is dauraan lashkar-e-taiyaba jaise sanghathan fale-foole
 They (jihadi terrorists) are our heroes
 "intervyuu ke dauraan musharraf ne yah bhi kaha ki osama bin laden or jilaluddin hakkaani pakistan ke "hero" hai
 Musharraf said in the interview, "we deployed religious fighters to Afghanistan in 1979 to benefit Pakistan and keep Soviet forces out of the country
" ham duniya bhar se mujahiddeen lekar aae, hamane unhen training di or hathiyaar bhi muhaiyaa karaae
 We trained the Taliban, sent them in
