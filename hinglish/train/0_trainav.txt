 In the capital city of Delhi, which is facing the rising cases of dengue chikungunya and the terror of mosquitoes, everyone is worried about how to deal with mosquitoes
 haal hi main international centre for genetic ejineering and biotechnology kii ek research main saamne aayaa he ki dengue chikangunia ke machharon se nipatane ke liye MCD kii kavayad let ho gai he
 Head of Vector Born Disease Dr
 sujatha sunil ke mutabikphoging or spreayingka kaam pre monsoon hi shuru ho janaa chahie taaki machharon kii breeding ko tabhi roka ja sake
 Dr
 sujatha ne kaha kii dilli ke sirf un ilaako main jahaan pani kii kami he or log pani store karte hai vahaan jaakar agar phoging, spreaying or breeding checking kaa kaam monsoon se pehle hi kar diya jaae to in machharon ko panpane se pehle hi khatm kiya ja saktaa hai
 Breeding is very low before the monsoon and that is why it is easy to eliminate mosquitoes and prevent them from flourishing
 monsoon shuru hote hi inaki breeding kai guna tej ho jaati he or inmachharon kii sankhyalakhon karodon main tabdeel ho jaati he
 In such a situation, it becomes very difficult to kill mosquitoes due to fogging and spraying
 research main ye bhi sabit hua he ki ye machhar apni life cycle ko human body ke bina bhi campalit kar sakate hai
 Therefore, it is very easy to grow in any watery place
 MCD din-raat alag-alag ilaakon main phoging aurchhidakavaka kaam kar rahi he lekin machharon par kaabo paanaa asambhav sa lag rahaa he
 But perhaps the same exercise would have been done if the pre-monsoon had been done
 in chemicals kaa istemaal kar rahi he mcddemgu, chikangunia ke machharon kii chaar alag-alag stage hoti hai jinhen panpane yaa maarane ke liye MCD ke paas alag-alag chemical or equipments hote hai
 Using these, they try to eliminate mosquitoes
 machharon ko panpane se rokane ke liye cooler yaa tank ke pani main temiphos grenules kaa istemaal kaaphi kargar he
 Municipal Corporation Malaria Inspector Dinesh Sharma also says that after putting these granules, if you clean the cooler and tank even after 15 days, then the effect will remain
 carosine main milakar istemaal hota he chemicalarva stage par machharon ko maarane ke liye bactecide kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he jo pitthu pump main daal kar naaliyon or duusari pani vaali jagah par spray kiya jaataa he
 By which mosquitoes can be prevented from growing
 iske alaava phoging se bhi zyada kargar wal spreaying hoti he jisamen alphasiaper mithen kaa istemaal hota he jise carosine main milakar banaaya jaataa he or gharon kii deevaaron par spray kiya jaataa he
 Its effect lasts for three months and the mosquito falls into its contact as soon as it sits on the wall

 unhone kaha ki rasgotra ne ek samachar channel ko diye intervyuu main kaha ki anderson ko giraftaar karnaa galati thi or yah vaayade kaa ulanghan tha
 This suggests that there was an agreement between the US and the Indian government to let Anderson leave India
 bhaajapa ne is puure prakaran main rajeev gandhi ke kathith rup se shaamil hone par vishesh jor diya he
 Sitharaman said, "rasgotra says that Rajiv Gandhi was out of Delhi at that time but when he returned, he was fully informed of the matter and he had no objection to letting Anderson out of the country

 a BJP spokesperson said, "later Rasgotra worked in the Congress's foreign affairs cell
 unhen pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne samprag-1 ke samay rashtriya salaahkaar parishad ke sadsy ke rup main bhi niyukt kiya tha
 Sitharaman urged the Congress to stop being happy by raising the issue of donations from the Dow by the BJP again and not to spread rumors about it
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa is bare main apane saboot saamne rakh chuki he
 He said, "dow has been in India since 1957 and has a presence in several states including Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra
 maharashtra main uske das kendra hai, jahaan congress das saal se shashan kar rahi he
 "justifying the agreement reached by Dow in Gujarat, he said that it is an agreement made under the Montreal Protocol, which sets guidelines regarding preventing ozone layer degradation and other environmental regulations
" bhopal gas traasadee ke sabhi pahaluon par vichaar kar rahe mantrisamooh ke bare main sitaraman ne kaha ki yadi peediton ke liye achche package kii sifarish aati he to bhaajapa ko sabase zyada khushi hogi lekin saath hi kaha ki 1984 kii traasadee ke doshiyon ko bakhsha nahin janaa chahie

 Abdul Jalil Mustan, Minister of Alcohol Prohibition and Excise of the Government of Bihar said that Bihar does not get anything from tourists, rather tourists only pollute the soil of Bihar
 bihar main nahin pine diya jayega sharabbihar main purnasharabbandikanoon ko patna hai court se radd kiye jane ke baad madh nishedh evam utpaada mantri abdul jaleel mastaan ne kaha ki bihar kii dharti par kisi ko bhi sharaab pine kii chhot nahin milegi

 mantri ne dhamkee bhare lahaze main kaha ki kisi bhi keemat par na to duusare rajyon se sharaab pikar bihar aane diya jayega or na hi duusare rajyon se sharaab kii taskari kar bihar laane diya jayega
 He said that whoever is caught doing this will not be spared
 abhi tak aapane hindustan main pakade gaye aatankiyon ko police kii giraft main dekha hoga or karnaamon ko sirf suna hoga
 But we will tell you how Abu Jundal, a teacher who taught Hindi to terrorist Ajmal Amir Kasab in Mumbai attack, got trained to become a terrorist in India
 ab yah raaj khul chukaa he ki kaise sirf pakistan main hi nahin, balki mumbai ke 26 / 11 hamale ke liye mumbai se mahaj 200 kimi
 The school of terror went away
 kaise us aatank kii paathshaala main taiyaar hue aise aatanki, jo aaj bhi hindustan ko hilaa rahe hai
 Aaj Tak's 'operation Nag' will expose the faces of those enemies of the country whose poison is stinging India in the face of blasts
 pehali baar ham aapako aatank kii chaar tasviren dikhaane ja rahe he
 The area where these photos were captured is more sensational than the face seen in the pictures, just two years before the 26 / 11 attack
 abhi tak 26 / 11 aatanki hamale kii sajeesh ko pakistan se jodakar dekha jaataa he, lekin tasviren khulaasa karti hai ki mumbai se majah 200 kilometre dur chal rahi thi aatank kii paathshaala
 These pictures of terrorist are of a secret hideout in Aurangabad city
 aatank kaa wo thikaana, jahaan se jude hai 26 / 11 hamale ke taar
 The hideout, where the teacher of terrorist Aamir Ajmal Kasab was preparing for the 26 / 11 attack
 aatankiyon main ek he jabuddin ansaari urf abu jundaal
 Fiyaz Kagji, the guru of terrorists, is sitting next to it
 ye tasviren 26 / 11 hamale se thik do saal pehle kii hai
 That is, two years ago, not only in Pakistan, but the attack on Mumbai was being planned at a secret hideout in Aurangabad, very close to Mumbai
 tasveeron main faiyaz kagaji ek saath kai ladakon ko jehad kii class de rahaa he
 Fayaz is trying to mislead people through this class
 tasveeron main do or ladke bhi dikhe hai, jinke bare main jaanch agenciyon ko ab tak koi khaas jaankaree haath nahin lagi he
 But according to sources both these boys are involved in the Aurangabad arms case and are currently absconding
 ek tasviir main faiyaz kagaji himaayat beg ko aatanki kii librari main kuch kitaaben dikhaane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Let us tell you that Himayat Baig was caught by the Mumbai ATS in 2010 in the German Bakery bomb blast of Pune, which has been sentenced to death
 ek tasviir he kisi dharmik program kii, jahaan tamaam ladakon ko aatanki banane ke liye puri tarah se prerit karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 What the boys of the class did after taking training in this school of terror, gave India never forgetting pain
 isi class main aatank kii shiksha lene ke baad abu jundaal aisa khoonkhaar ho gaya ki pakistan main jaakar mumbai hamale kii taiyaari main shaamil ho gaya or maut baantne aa rahe 10 pakistani hamalaavaron ko na sirf hindi bolne kii training di, balki karachi ke control room main baithkar hamale ke liye kasaab samet saare aatankiyon ko phone par nirdesh bhi detaa rahaa
 This most dreadful class of terror was going on very close to Mumbai, but no investigative agency could find any inkling of the country
 nateeja mumbai hamale kii shakl main sabake saamne he

 This made Sumitra Mahajan very sad

 # The adage 'guddi ke lal' fits perfectly with Munnavati living in the Bedo area of jharkhand
 behad garib parivaar se taalluk rakhane vaali munnavati devi par padhane kaa aisa junun he ki garibi uske aade nahin ai
 When the family could not afford her education, she started working as a daily wage to meet the expenses
 din main mazdooree or phir raat main padhai
 You will be stunned to learn that this Bala has done MA, mphil in such a subject, from which good people run away
 ji haa, sanskrit


ek aisa vishay, jo naakon chane chabavaata he
 Not only this, Munnavati has also won the gold medal
 ranchi uniwarsity dwaara yojit dikshant samaaroh main kendriya grahamantri ne gold medal dekar munnavati ko sammanit kiya
 Munnavati was happily receiving the Gold Medal at the Convocation Program of Ranchi University in a black gown and red scarf at the hands of the country's Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde
 kabhi aisa bhi laga tha ki inaki niyati gaanv main kaam ke boj main dabe dihadi mazdooree karnaa he
 The story of Munnavati, a resident of a remote Naxal-affected Bedo village in Ranchi, from wages to medals, is an example in itself
 ise jisane bhi suni, uske ankhon main aansu aa gaye
 Despite belonging to a very poor family, Munnavati never gave up her studies despite millions of obstacles
 bachapan main hi pita kaa saaya sar se hat gaya
 There is a brother, who is unemployed
 duusari taraf maa ko kidney kii beemaari
 In such a situation, when you have to eat food at home, then studying was a distant thing
 lekin munnavati ne haar nahin maani
 He started wages, in which he received five rupees of hard work throughout the day
 din main mazdooree karti or raat main padhai karti rahi
 Then came the day when in the session 2010-12, he scored 1046 i
e
 65 out of a total of 1600 points
 35 fisadi ank lekar sanskrit vishay main ranchi uniwarsity main top kiya or gold medal par kabja jamaa liya
 According to Munnavati, the situation of food and water in the house is very delicate
 subah khaane ke baad shaam ke khaane ko sochna padataa he
 Although today he is happy to get the gold medal
 vahiin munnavati kii maa kii tamanna he ki vah gaanv kii seva kare
 Munnavati Kumari has been a bright student since the beginning
 praathmik shiksha se lekar hair ajukeshan tak, har jagah unhone apni safalataa kaa paracham laharaaya he
 In 1998, at the time of unified Bihar, he did first class matriculation with Bihar School Examination Board
 phir vah mazdooree ke saath ek skool main metric ke hi chaatro ko padhaane lagi
 Due to poverty, after five years, he got inter and graduation degree from Bedo
 iske baad eme karne ke liye ranchi pahunchi
 But whenever discharged, she would meet the economic needs by doing wages
 mehnat rang laai or unhone uniwarsity main top kiya or gold medal kii haqadaar bani
 Munnavati is an example for those who get scared of poverty and get away from education
 haalanki gold medal lene ke baad bhi uskaa sangharsh abhi jari rahegaa
 Munnavati wants to go ahead and become a professor and educate those who are unable to study for lack of money

 During the debate on how to be the leader of silence in the name of the ideal leader, when asked about the names of any ideal leader, these three leaders of different parties all remained silent
 isse pehle kapil sibbal ne kaha tha ki desh main ab bhi kai adarsh netaa hai
 Giving a political reply, Sibal said that you should ask people who is the ideal leader in the country
 unhone gandhi ji ke sandarbh main kaha ki ve agar aaj paidaa hote to kaise netaa hote, kaha nahin ja saktaa
 Today's circumstances are very different than before
 seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki netaa paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par banate hai
 On this, Jaitley said that political circumstances constantly change, this is the situation that leaders create
 faisle lete vakt netaaon par kitna dabaav?kapil sibbal ne kaha ki desh ke bade faisle lete vakt sarkaar par koi dabaav nahin hota
 There are allegations that the government takes decisions under the pressure of corporate houses, but this does not happen
 sarkaar apane faisle nishpaksh hokar deshhit main leti he
 On this issue, Arun Jaitley said that many types of pressure groups try to put pressure on the government, but political parties have many responsibilities
 raajnneetik dalon ko in par khara utarana hota he
 Discussion on Kejriwal's charge: Arvind Kejriwal often keeps alleging that there is a nexus between BJP and Congress
 isi par arun jetali ne kaha ki aisa nahin he
 There is no fixing in both the parties
 kejariwal ke aaropon par kapil sibbal ne kaha ki raajnneeti main in dinon bade halkepan se aarope lagaae ja rahe hai
 If there are facts in the charge, then they can be raised among the public, but nothing can be done on baseless allegations
 arun jetali ne kaha ki raajnneeti ab sirf netaaon tak simit nahin he
 Civil society and media have full influence on this
 in donon kii raajnneeti main badi bhoomika he
 Jaitley says that many times allegations are made without strong facts and evidence
 kshetreey dalon kaa prabhavasipiai netaa seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki desh kii saamaajik vividhta raajnneeti main bhi dikhegi
 In the coming days, regional political parties will play a big role in the country's politics
 neshnal level kii partiyon ko in kshetreey dalon ko jodna padegaa
 Sibal said that there is no political party that can fulfill all the dreams of 100 million people
 arun jetali ne is mudde par kaha ki pichley 20-30 saalon main kshetreey dal kaaphi prabhavi hue hai
 In such a situation, the expectations of the regions have died down
 epadiai ke masale par phixingbijepi netaa arun jetali kaa maananaa he ki sadan main epadiai ke mudde par sibiai ne sadan main phixing karai he
 If all parties had voted, the result would have been different
 sibiai puri tarah sarkaar kii pakad main he or sarkaar usase vaisaa hi kaam leti he, jaisaa vah chaahati he
 On the issue of FDI in retail, Sitaram Yechury said that the matter was not about communal and secular issues
 yah desh ke liye tha
 On this, Kapil Sibal questioned the NDA
 unhone kaha ki endie ke samay main bhi sibiai kaa galat istemaal hua tha
 Debate on Lokpal, Kapil Sibal asks BJP on this important issue, why the Bharatiya Janata Party does not implement it in their states? If she had done so, she would have been entitled to question the UPA
 sibbal ne mukhya rup se gujarat kaa mudda uthaaya
 Who will be the next leader? Kapil Sibal said that who will be the next leader of Congress, it will be decided in 2014
 udhar, narendra modi kii pradhanmantri pad kii daavedaari par arun jetali ne kuch bhi nahin kiya or sawaal ko taal gaye
 Jaitley said that BJP and NDA will decide their leader when the time comes
 usase pehle kuch bhi kahana thik nahin he
 Sitaram Yechury also said that it is not necessary for national parties to announce the candidate for Prime Minister before the elections
 yah faisla party ko hi lenaa hota he
 Image of political parties Arun Jaitley said that every political party is concerned about its image
 is par party ke bheetar hi charchaa bhi hoti rahati he
 If any party is accused, then it definitely thinks about it
 kapil sibbal ne bhi kaha ki party par lagane vaale aaropon par party ke bheetar hi charchaa hoti he or is par vichaar kiya jaataa he

 Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel is believed to be suitable for the post
 party ne patel votaron ko rijhaane kii koshish ke tahat is disha main sochna shuru kiya he
 The first phase of voting for the assembly in Gujarat will take place on 9 December
 7 disambar ko chunaav prachaar samaapt hoga
 Till now bjp's rally in Patel areas has been normal in the election campaign
 piem kii raily main bheed to jute rahi he lekin bheed main utsaah kii kami bhaajapa saaf mahasoos kar rahi he
 Whether it was in the last elections in 2007 or in the 2012 Modi rally, the enthusiasm of the people used to be seen
 duusari taraf congress bhipatel ilakonmen is baar kaaphi prabhavi dikh rahi he
 The accusation of harassing Hardik Patel is causing Congress
 saath hi yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki bhaajapa ne patel votaron or netaaon ko hameshaa darkinar kiya he
 Whether it has been Keshubhai Patel, whether Anandiben Patel or Nitin Patel, why has not the BJP kept him on a low standard
 anandiben patel kii kursi le lee
 Nitin Patel was not allowed to become CM at the last moment
 is tarah ke aarope se bhaajapa ko mushkil pesh aa rahi he
 Sources say that after reviewing these situations, there is a thinking in the BJP that this signal is to encourage Patel voters who are with the BJP and to unite those Patel voters who are on the verge of losing the BJP
 It should be given that after the elections, the command of power will remain in the hands of the Patels
 iske liye jaruri he ki pratham charan ke voting se pehle kisi patel pratyaashee ko siem pratyaashee ghoshit kar diya jaae
 Nitin Patel is considered to be the first choice for this
 gauratlab he ki bhaajapa is ranneeti ko himachal main lagu kar chuki he jab chunavi raily se prem kumaar dhumal ko siem pratyaashee ghoshit kar rajput votaron ko saadhane kii koshish kii gai
 Though Manohar Parrikar was not declared a candidate in Goa elections, Parrikar was being declared as a CM candidate indirectly through press briefings and general meetings
 goa chunaav ke baad bhaajapa ne apni samiksha main yah paaya tha ki yadi parrikar ko pehle hi goa kaa siem ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya jaataa to shaayad party apane dam par bahumat paa sakati thi
 Keeping these things in mind, the party has started thinking towards making Patel face a candidate for a large majority in Gujarat

 (A huge crowd gathered on the occasion of the burning of Ravana at Gandhi Maidan before the accident) and then the accident happened as the officers and karinds, under the supervision of their bosses, also considered it as a part of their duty and got discharged from their assigned work
 is salanaa jalse main shariq hone ke liye juty kareeb chaar lakh logon kii vishaal bheed ke nikalne ke liye sirf do get khule chode gaye the
 The most obvious reason for the stampede was to keep the gates closed even after the program was over

 The cowcatcher (cattle cage) built outside the Gandhi Maidan is believed to be the cause of the stampede

 10 night though
 30 baje ve patna laut aae, lekin piemasiech main peediton se milane aadhi raat ke baad hi pahunch sake
 Many people raised their eyebrows after seeing Manjhi's rituals heavy on blood - when he was expected to return to the capital immediately mourning the accident, he deemed it necessary to complete a family ritual
 vaise patna lautakar 70 varshiya maanjhi ne tabadatod kadam uthaae or kamishnar evam diiji ke alaava patna ke dm or esaspi ko hataa diya
 However, it is still considered a 'very small' punishment in lieu of such a huge tragedy
 lekin varisht naukarshahon ke khilaaf is kathor karrwai se maanjhi kaa apana kad kuch inch to badha hi he
 Manjhi's immediate decision-making style is completely different from that of his predecessor Nitish Kumar
 kisi bhi ghatana yaa vivaad par nitish kii pasandida karrwai hoti thi, jaanch samiti kaa elaan
 In November 2012, when 19 people were killed in a similar stampede while celebrating Chhath festival in Patna, Nitish formed an inquiry committee
 samiti ne baad main sabhi sarkari adhikariyon ko bari kar diya tha
 He formed similar investigation committees even after the mid-day meal death in July 2013 and the October 2013 bombings at Gandhi Maidan
 lekin kisi bhi varisht adhikari ko kabhi koi sajaa nahin mili
 JD (U) senior minister Vijay Chaudhary says, "the Manjhi government acted at the right time
 mukhyamantri ne na sirf jaanch bithai balki varisht afasaron ko hataa bhi diya
 Now those officers are not in a position to influence the investigation

 Manjhi at the same time lodged a strong objection to his absence and suspended him

 In the fateful evening, the injured people started reaching PMCH from 7 o'clock

 30 baje pahunche
 On visiting PMCH two days after the accident, Manjhi noticed many more serious disturbances
 mukhyamantri ne paaya ki kuch or doctor bhi duty par maujuud nahin the
 Four such doctors have been transferred to the unit in-charge of various wards, while three doctors have been asked to explain the reasons for their mistakes

" jaahir he, jaruri kadam nahin uthaae gaye the
 "the state government has formed a team to investigate the accident, in which Amir Subhani, principal secretary of the home department, and additional director general (headquarters) Gupteshwar Pandey have been appointed
" maanjhi ke iraadon ko lekar koi andeh nahin he
 Says a senior IAS, "bureaucrats are still used to the undisputed power and dominance of former Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and not Manjhi
 maanjhi ko ab bhi ek kaamchalaoo mukhyamantri hi mana jaataa he
 "that's where BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi says," Bihar's downfall began in June 2013 when Nitish Kumar broke away from the BJP
 bahumat kii suraksha ke hatate hi nitish nirdaleey sadasyon ke muhtaaj ho gaye or unka sara dhyaan achche rajkaaj se hatakar kisi na kisi tarah apni sarkaar ko satta main banaae rakhane tak simat gaya
 The situation worsened after Nitish's defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 khud mukhyamantri ke pad se istipha dene or maanjhi ko apana uttaradhikari banane ke baad samajha jaataa he ki nitish kii ummid nepathy se jedy(you) ko chalaane kii rahi hogi
 But due to internal rebellion in the party, he got caught in the limelight
 secular takaton kii ekta kii khatir jedy (you) netaa sharad yadav ke lagaataar jor daalane ke baavjood nitish ne argedy pramukh lalu yadav se duuri bana rakhi thi
 But to secure the existence of the Manjhi government, he finally agreed to join Lalu
 haalanki argedy ne bahumat ke sankat se ubarne main unki madad kii, lekin phir bhi nitish kii haisiyat aaj kamjor ho chuki he
 In such a situation, what is it that Manjhi, who has gained his strength from Nitish, is also standing on very rough ground
 ek iees afasar kehete hai, ''koi aadhikarik remote control to he nahin
 Both Lalu and Nitish are in touch with each other
 samajha jaataa he ki naukarshah or mantri, donon lalu or nitish se sampark main rahete hai tathaa un donon se maargdarshan lete rahete hai
 Why not to happen? After all, both are projected as Super Chief Ministers
 aise main mantriyon or afasaron ne bhi maanjhi ko gambhirtha se lenaa band kar diya he
 Manjhi has made a rare sense of his power by ordering Verma and other senior officials to encash the boria-bed
 lekin naukarshahon ke bare main faisla lene kii thodi-bahut gunjaaish bhale hi maanjhi ke paas ho, par mantriyon ke maamle main lagata nahin ki unki baat kaa koi vajan he
 In June, he had to include Mahachandra Prasad Singh in his cabinet
 hatya ke ek maamle main mahachandra ke khilaaf aarope-patr daakhil ho chukaa he or saaran court main ve mukademe kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 Similarly, in August, when Samastipur Police registered an FIR against Animal and Fisheries Minister Baidyanath Sahni, Manjhi promised 'strict action' against him

 World Uygar Congress (WUC) leader and Chinese rebel Dolcan Isa believes that this has been done under pressure from China after India canceled his visa

 interpol dwaara red corner notice jari kiye jane par unka kahana he ki interpol raajnneetik khilonaa ban chukaa he
 Introducing the first part of the special talk from Hadolcan Christ
 
 
 sawaal- bharat ne aapako vija dene ke baad radd kiya
 What was the reason given for this? kya aapane dobaaraa koshish kii?dolcan isa-yah durbhagyapurna he ki bharat sarkaar ne bina kisi tarah kaa thos kaaran bataae meraa vija radd kar diya
 After this i have not applied again
 bharat ek loktantric desh he
 The world's largest democracy
 isliye bharat kii ye jimmedaari banati he ki vah uigar or tibeti jaise logon ke daman par spasht taur par bole
 India should become a model of democracy in Asia
 sawaal- kya china ke dabaav main aakar vija radd kiya gaya? yadi haa, to bharat par kis tarah kaa dabaav ho saktaa he?dolcan isa-nishchit taur par china ke dabaav main aakar bharat ne mujhe or mere jaise anya kaaryakartaaon ko andeh ke aadhaar par vija dene se manaa kar diya
 We know that China is a major economic power in India's neighborhood
 lekin bharat ke liye china ke saath shanti banaae rakhane ke saath hi anya saamaajik or maanavadhikaar kaaryakartaaon ke adhikaron kaa samarthan karte hue donon sthitiyon ke bich santulan banaae rakhana jaruri he
 India should help the Uygar and Tibetan community without succumbing to pressure from countries like China
 sawaal- bharat ke bare main aap kya sochate hai? ise kaise desh ke rup main dekhte hai? bharat se aapaki apekshaayen kya hai?dolcan isa-ham sabhi jaanate hai ki jansankhya ke aadhaar main bharat is grah par sabase bada loktantric desh he
 Although India is faced with widespread issues like poverty in some areas, the situation is also changing gradually
 bharat ek bade raashtra ke rup main uth khadaa hua he, jo loktantr ke liye parivartan karne main sakasham he
 The same thing can be said about China
 main bharat aana chahta tha, lekin vija radd hone kii vajah se nahin aa sakaa
 i hope to visit India in the future
 main aashaa karata hum ki uigar ke log bharat kii sarkaar or yahaan ke logon ke saath madhur sambandh banaae rakh sakenge
 Question- You were compared to terrorist Azhar Masood
 is par kya pratikriya he? aap usko aatanki maanate hai?dolcan isa-maine mukhya rup se maanavadhikaron ke liye kaam kiya he
 But the Chinese government declared me a terrorist because of my support for the Uygar community
 china aksar shantipurna tareeke se maanavadhikaar ke liye kaam karne vaale kaaryakartaaon ko aatankwaadiyon se jodne kii koshish karata he
 Since the 9 / 11 incident, China has been suppressing the innocent in East Turkestan in the name of 'war against terrorism'
 iske saath hi antarrashtriya samudaay ke saamne uigar samudaay ko hinsak rup main dikhaane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 i reject any comparison with Pakistani terrorist Masood Azhar, for which China vetoed the UN Security Council
 is tarah kii tulana mere dwarawigar samudaayake adhikaron ke liye kiye ja rahe ahimsak prayaason ko hatotsahit karne kii ek koshish he

 Alok Verma, who has been embroiled in controversy since the Central Vigilance Commission's (CVC) serious allegations, has finally been removed from the post of Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation
 CVC ne apni report main alok verma par bhrashtachar ke gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 Along with this, the CBI also said to remove the records and immediately investigate against Alok Verma
 sivisi ne apni report main aarope lagaaya ki alok verma ko moin kuraishi or anya ke maamle kii jaanch band karne ke liye satish babu sanaa ne 2 karod rupee kii ghoose di
 Alok Verma tried to save Rakesh Saxena, the main accused in the IRCTC case, from a CBI investigation
 iske alaava sibiai diarector ke pad par rahete hue alok verma ne rashtriya janata dal (RJD) supremeo lalu prasad yadav ke thikaanon par talaashi abhiyaan nahin lene kaa nirdesh bhi jari kiya tha
 The CVC, considering the cases to be serious, sent notice to Alok Verma thrice and asked to present the documents
 haalanki sibiai kii taraf se dastavejon ko pesh karne ke liye taarikh badhaane kii apil kii gai
 After this, the CVC postponed the case from 14 September 2018 to 18 September 2018
 aaie jaanate hai ki sivisi ne apni 23 point kii report main kya-kya baaten kahin
 1
 alok verma par moin kuraishi cese main satish babu sanaa se 2 karod rupee ghoose lene kaa aarope tha
 2
 alok verma par iarsitisi cese main lalu prasad yadav ke parisar main talaashi nahin lene ke nirdesh sibiai ke sanyukt nideshak ko jari karne kaa aarope tha
 Some more such serious allegations were made on the CBI director in running the CBI
 3
 The Director was issued 3 notices on 14 September 2018 regarding these allegations, presenting necessary files and documents before the commission
 4
 The CBI was requested to give more time in the matter, postponing the hearing till 18 September 2018
 5
 On September 18, the CBI had written to the commission in relation to Rakesh Asthana that the allegations made in the case on the officer concerned appear to be true
 unke khilaaf aadhe darjan se zyada cese main aapraadhik kadachaar ke saboot paae gaye the
 The officer was also aware of the CBI having evidence against him
 sibiai ne kaha tha ki rakesh asthana kii shikaayat ko gambhirtha se nahin lenaa chahie, kyonki yah ek daagi adhikari kii sibiai ke duusare adhikariyon ko dhamkaane kii koshish he
 The CBI had said that it is also ready to provide the necessary files to the commission
 saath hi sibiai ne shikayatakarta kii pahchaan bhi poochi thi
 6
 sibiai kii 18 sitambar kii chitthee ke sandarbh main kamishan ne shikayatakarta kii pahchaan bataane se inkaar kar diya tha
 The commission then reiterated its three earlier notices to the CBI director and asked to submit all documents and files by 20 September
 7
 On September 19, the CBI wrote to the commission and told the commission that documents of the Moin Qureshi case are being collected from various branches
 kamishan ne sibiai se is cese kii original noteshit file or record 24 sitambar tak pesh karne ko kaha
 8
 sibiai ne 24 sitambar ko apni chitthee main likhaa ki record hajaaron pannon main hai, filein malkhana, court aadi jagahon par hai
 It takes three weeks to present them
 kamishan ne kaha ki inhen yathashighra pesh kiya jaae
 However, the CBI was asked to present the notesheet file in the headquarters by September 28
 09
 On October 9, the commission said on the basis of a letter from the CBI that it has been a month since the CBI sought the files regarding the complaint
 kamishan ne mana ki sibiai kii file saarvajanik sampatti nahin he, lekin ise sakasham adhikari dekh saktaa he
 The commission again advised the CBI director to assist in the necessary investigation and asked to show the documents by 22 October, but by 23 October neither the documents nor the deadline were requested to be extended
 10
 Meanwhile, CBI Special Director Rakesh Asthana has repeatedly made verbal and written allegations against Alok Verma and said that Alok Verma and AK Sharma should be separated from the investigation into the 6 charges leveled by him
 iske baad kamishan ne 25 sitambar ko kaha ki kamishan ko sibiai ke kisi adhikari ke khilaaf saboot nahin mili hai, lekin use jaanch main nishpakshta baratani chahie
 11
 25 sitambar ko sibiai nideshak ko ek or chitthee bheji gai or kaha gaya ki kamishan dwaara maangi gai jaankaree ke bare main kai reminder bheje gaye, lekin 10 maheene bitne ke baad bhi koi ection nahin liya gaya he
 The result of internal report about this was asked to be told by 3 October
 12
 With no response till 3 October, the CBI director was asked to meet the CVC on 4 October in the context of Rakesh Asthana's representation
 isamen sibiai nideshak nahin aae
 13
 15 oktober ko ek or chitthee sibiai nideshak ko bheji gai
 In this, it was asked to get the necessary permission before any investigation against any CBI officer
 sibiai nideshak se phir se jaruri dastavej muhaiyaa karaane ko kaha gaya
 14
 is dauraan pataa chalaa ki 15 oktober ko sibiai ne hyderabad ke satish babu sanaa kii shikaayat par ek cese darj kiya he, jo ki sibiai ke vishesh nideshak dwaara jaanch kiye ja rahe maamle main aaropee he
 The Special Director claims that he had sought permission to arrest it, which was not received by the CBI Director
 rakesh asthana kamishan ke saamne 12, 18, 19 or 20 oktober ko pesh hue
 On October 20, CBI DSP Devinder Kumar wrote a letter to the director that his house was being searched by Satish Babu on false allegations of contact with him, while he had already appealed to arrest and interrogate Satish, who till date Approval not received
 unhone kaha ki unhen bali kaa bakra banaaya ja rahaa he
 The commission received this letter on 22 October
 15
 On October 22, Sai Manohar, joint director of the cbi's SIT, wrote to the commission citing Rakesh Asthana's record that sources in the Moin Qureshi case revealed that the CBI director was given a bribe of Rs 2 crore
 16
 The commission admitted that the CBI director was not helping in the investigation and did not provide any file
 teen hafte maangane ke baad bhi koi record sabamit nahin kiya gaya
 17
 sivisi ne aarope lagaaya ki usne is baat ko gaur kiya ki sibiai ne isi tarah duusare maamalon main bhi record nahin pesh kiye
 18
 sivisi ne kaha ki sibiai ne maamle kii jaanch main sahyog nahin kiya
 The CVC work was intentionally hampered
 19
 The report stated that section 8 (1) (a) of the CVC Act empowered the CVC to supervise the functions of the CBI
 jahaan tak bhrashtachar ke in aaropon kii baat he, to bhrashtachar kanoon ke tahat sivisi isaki jaanch karne ke liye patibaddh he
 20
 sivisi ne apni report main kaha ki usko cabinet sachiv ne 24 agast 2018 ko shikaayat di thi, jiske baad usne apni shaktiyon kaa istemaal karte hue sibiai se maamle main record pesh karne ko kaha, lekin 40 din guzar gaye or record pesh nahin kiya gaya
 When the CBI did not present the record and did not cooperate, due to which the CVC is unable to discharge its duty in cases of these serious allegations
 21
 The quarrel inside the CBI has increased considerably, which has also damaged the dignity of the investigating agency
 sibiai ke ek varisht adhikari dwaara duusare sheersh adhikari ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aarope lagane kii khabaren media main bhi khub chalin, jisase bhi jaanch agency ke andar varking envyranment (working environment) kharaab hua

 This time the Chief Minister of the state and veteran Congressman Virbhadra Singh chose a seat from where the BJP had been winning for the last 10 years
 is seat par unka muqabla bijepi ke ummidavaar ratna singh paal se tha

 pichley 10 saalon se arki vidhansabha par bijepi kaa kabja rahaa he lekin congress chah baar ke mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ko utarkar apane puraane garh main vaapasi karne kii koshish main he
 The people of Arki held the Congress's hand in the three assembly elections held from 1993-2003, but in the two elections after 2007, the people fed the lotus and ousted Congress from this seat
 is baar congress apane puraane garh main siem virbhadra singh ke sahare jahaan vaapasi karne kii koshish kar rahi he, vahiin bijepi ke saamne apni seat bachaae rakhane kii chunauti he

 He then became the candidate of Lokraj Party in 1972 and retained his dominance in this seat
 1985 main congress ke ummidavaar ke taur par hira singh paal ne chunaav ladaa or is seat par phir se apana kabja kiya
 Then in 1993, 1998 and 2003, Congress's Dharam Pal Thakur hit a hat-trick of his success
 haalanki 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ke govind ram sharma ne congress ke dharam paal thakur kaa vijayi rath roak diya or phir 2012 main bhi govind ram sharma ne congress ko vaapasi kaa mauka nahin diya
 Whenever the seat was changed, then he won
 Singh has contested 13 elections in his 50-plus-long career and has won all till now
 virbhadra singh ne chauthi baar apana nirvachan kshetra badla he
 Singh, 83, contested from Jubbal in 1983, Kothakai in 1985, 1990, 1993, 1998, 2003, Rohdu in 2007 and Shimla Rural in 2012

 BJP also launched its star campaigner for the election campaign in the Star Star campaign

 On fleeing from Bhopal jail and then killing them, former Home Secretary RK Singh says that killing all the eight terrorists is a big achievement, because if these terrorists managed to escape, they could take instructions from Pakistan via Pakistan And after this, any major incident in the country could be carried out
 unka kahana he ki inatankiyonke bhaagane ke peeche badi planning rahi hogi
 Who used to come to meet them should be investigated
 isaki bhi jaanch honi chahie ki kya inako din dhalane ke baad jail main band kar diya jaataa tha yaa khulaa rakhaa gaya tha
 If he was jailed, then how did people get out and managed to escape
 bada sawaal ye he ki in aatankiyon ko ek hi cell main kyon rakhaa gaya tha

 In a befitting reply to critics who advised him to retire, India's legendary batsman Sachin Tendulkar said, "my critics did not teach me cricket
" ’’ haal main 100 antarrashtriya shatak jamaane kaa vishwa record apane naam karne vaale master ballebaaj kaa maananaa he ki jis din unhen lagegaa ki bharat ke liye ballebaaji karne ke liye jate samay unke andar ‘‘cricket ke prati junun’’ kam ho rahaa he to ‘‘main cricket chhod duungaa
 '' And '' My critics will not need to say this (advice to retire)
 ’’ tendulkar ne kaha ki ve cricket khelte hai kyonki unhen yah acha lagata he
 There is nothing better than playing for India
 ek patrika ke taaja sanskaran ko die intervyuu main tendulkar ne kaha, ‘‘aaj bhi jab main apane saathiyon ke saath rashtriya gaan ke liye khadaa hota hum to ab bhi mere rongte khadey ho jate hai
 He said, "they (critics) can raise many questions but they cannot answer the questions raised on their own because none of them will understand my condition and it is impossible for them to know
" What i am thinking and feeling
 ’’ tippaniyan Asked Tendulkar if it was difficult to cross the barrier of scoring 100th century, he said, "there is no doubt that it was a difficult time
" 100waan shatak bananaa kaaphi kathin tha, lekin mujhe khud nahin pataa ki aisa kyon tha
 "he said," Maybe because this great century had turned into a national obsession and perhaps because i was not able to escape the discussions of the 100th international century which is affecting my subconscious mind or it may be Maybe God is trying to make me try harder
 ’’ yah poochne par ki pichley saal vishwa cap jeetne ke baad kya kabhi bhi unke man main vanade se sanyas lene kii baat ai to tendulkar ne jawaab diya, ‘‘aisi baat kabhi bhi mere man main nahin ai
 "tendulkar said," Many of my friends also asked why i did not retire after winning the World Cup
 ho saktaa he ve sahi hon
 The time was also right after winning the World Cup and everyone was excited and what could have been a better time to leave ODI cricket, but to be honest i never thought of retiring
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘vishwa cap puure desh kii jeet thi or mujhe apane liye (sanyas kii ghoshnaa) iskaa prayog karne kaa koi haq nahin tha
 My retirement was not so important
 agar main sanyas kii ghoshnaa kar detaa to sara dhyaan vishwa cap kii khitaabi jeet se hatakar mere sanyas par aa jaataa or main itnaa swaarthee nahin hum kyonki vishwa cap kii jeet bharat kii thi
 '' tendulkar ne kaha ki vah ab bhi cricket kaa lutf uthaa rahe hai or sanyas ke bare main abhi soch bhi nahin rahe hai
 He said, "I am enjoying playing cricket and will keep playing as long as i like
 mujhe apane sanyas kii baat media se chupaane koi jarurat nahin he
 They (media) have been with me for 25 years, i will definitely tell the media
 philhal sanyas ke bare main soch bhi nahin rahaa hum
 "this great batsman said," i always want to be good and always strive to excel, but you (media) people like "the Greatest", i am both honored and embarrassed
 Feel with ’’ tendulkar ne kaha, ‘‘sar don breadman or gairi sobers do mahaan cricketer hue hai or mere samay ke bryaan lara shen warn jaik kalis riki ponting or rahul dravid sabhi ek se badhkar ek hai
 He said, "my cricket journey has taught me that no matter how good you are or how talented you are, you have to be ready to grind in times of difficulty
" aapako kathin parishram ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hoga or lagaataar kathin parishram karte rahanaa hoga
 "sachin, who has been playing cricket for 25 years, says," There is never a shortcut to success and it is also important to know that passion, commitment and concentration is necessary to chase dreams and i started my career Have relied on these three basic things
 ’’ In an interview given to the latest edition of a magazine, Tendulkar said, "even today when i stand for the national anthem with my colleagues, my hair still stands
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘ve (aalochana karne vaale) anek sawaal uthaa sakate hai lekin ve apane hi khadey kiye gayi sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin de sakate kyonki unamem se koi bhi meri dasha ko nahin samaj paaegaa or yah naammumkin he ki ve jaan len ki main kya soch rahaa hum or kaisaa mahasoos kar rahaa hum
 '' Comments tendulkar se yah poochne par ki 100waan shatak banane kii baadha paar karne kaa samay kathin tha to unhone kaha, ‘‘isamen koi shaq nahin ki yah kathin samay tha
 The 100th century was hard to make, but i myself don't know why it was
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘shaayad isliye ki yah mahashatak ek rashtriya junun main badal chukaa tha or shaayad isliye ki main 100wein antarrashtriya shatak kii charchaaon se nahin batch paa rahaa tha jo kahin mere avchetan man par asar daal rahi ho yaa phir yah bhi ho saktaa he ki bhagwaan mujhe kathin prayaas karana chaah rahaa ho
 "when asked whether he ever came to mind after retiring from the ODI after winning the World Cup last year, Tendulkar replied," Such a thing never came to my mind
 ’’ tendulkar ne kaha, ‘‘mere anek doston ne bhi yah poocha ki vishwa cap jeetne ke baad maine sanyas kyon nahin liya
 Maybe they are right
 vah samay bhi sahi tha vishwa cap jeetne ke baad sabhi utsahit the or van de cricket chhodane kaa isse acha samay or kya ho saktaa tha lekin sachhee baat kahuun to mere man main sanyas lene kaa vichaar kabhi aayaa hi nahin
 "he said," The World Cup was a victory for the whole country and i had no right to use it for myself (announcement of retirement)
 meraa sanyas itnaa mahatvapurn nahin tha
 If i had announced my retirement, all the attention would have shifted from the World Cup title win to my retirement and i am not so selfish as India won the World Cup
 ’’ Tendulkar said that he is still enjoying cricket and is not even thinking about retirement
 unhone kaha, ‘‘main cricket khilne kaa majaa le rahaa hum or jab tak mujhe acha lagegaa kheltaa rahoonga
 There is no need to hide my retirement from the media
 ve (media) mere saath 25 saal se hai, yakeenan media ko bataaungaa
 i am not even thinking about retirement at the moment
 ’’ is mahaan ballebaaj ne kaha, ‘‘ main hameshaa acha bananaa chahta hum or hameshaa hi utkrushtataa hasil karne kaa prayaas karata hum, lekin aap (media) log ‘‘ da greatst’’ jaisaa thappa lagaate ho to main sammanit or sharminda donon ek saath mahasoos karata hum
 "tendulkar said," Sir Don Bradman and Gary Sobers have been two great cricketers and my time Brian Lara Shane Warne Jack Kallis, Ricky Ponting and Rahul Dravid are all more than one
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘meri cricket yatra ne mujhe sikhaaya he ki aap kitne hi achche ho yaa kitne hi pratibhashali ho aap ko kathnai ke samay main pisane ke liye bhi taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 You have to be prepared for hard work and constantly work hard
 ’’ 25 saal se cricket khel rahe sachin kaa kahana he, ‘‘safalataa kaa kabhi koi shortkat nahin hota or yah jaananaa bhi jaruri he ki sapanom kaa peechha karne ke liye junun, patibaddhta or ekaagratha kaa hona jaruri he or maine apane karier ke shuru se hi inhen teen mul chizon par bharosa rakhaa he

 "tendulkar said," Sir Don Bradman and Gary Sobers have been two great cricketers and my time Brian Lara Shane Warne Jack Kallis, Ricky Ponting and Rahul Dravid are all more than one

 "this great batsman said," i always want to be good and always strive to excel, but you (media) people like "the Greatest", i am both honored and embarrassed

 He said, "my cricket journey has taught me that no matter how good you are or how talented you are, you have to be ready to grind in times of difficulty
" aapako kathin parishram ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hoga or lagaataar kathin parishram karte rahanaa hoga
 "sachin, who has been playing cricket for 25 years, says," There is never a shortcut to success and it is also important to know that passion, commitment and concentration is necessary to chase dreams and i started my career Have relied on these three basic things

 ) Budget 2018 was arguably Modi's special occasion
 isamen kahin koi shaq kii gunjaaish nahin
 He not only did all that, but also assured that everyone should know it
 sansad main kendriya bajet pesh hone ke fouran baad pradhanmantri narendra modi ek haath main kalam or duusare main notepad liye tivi par pahunch gaye or bade chaav se achche-khaase 25 minute tak uski mukhya baaten ginate rahe
 It was in Modi's mind that this is the last full budget of his government
 unka har lafj desh ke matadaataaon ko yah sandesh de rahaa tharu main aapkaa pradhan sevak hum, mujhe aapaki phikr he, mujhe desh kii phikr he, main aapaki samasya dur karne aayaa hum, main agle aam chunaav kii nahin, agali peedi kii soch rahaa hum
 Modi said that the schemes presented in the budget will create immense employment opportunities in the country
 narendra modi badi soch, bade naare dene kii kaabiliyat pehle hi jaahir kar chuke hai
 His latest slogan now is "new India" by 2022, "restoration of" Social and Economic Democracy "and" Increase in Ease of Life "
 unamem jokhim uthaane kaa bhi bada madda he
 Be it a surgical strike against Pakistan, a demonetisation campaign against black money, or the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), Modi has shown in every case that whatever price he has to pay, he wants action
 ve aage badaae se nahin hichakenge
 Demonetisation brought political success but the economy was dung
 jiesti arthvyavastha kii jarurat thi magar siyaasi sankat kaa sabab bhi
 One by one, these two economic shakes started to divest the growth of the country, then Narendra Modi's unbeatable image began to fall
 lekin pradhanmantri ne dikhaaya ki ve hameshaa morche par date rahane ko taiyaar hai, galatiyon se sikhkar fouran sudhaar karne ko tatpar hai
 Then, the Budget 2018 also made it clear that, despite the inconsistencies and contradictions of the economy and politics, they have the potential to take great risks
 bajet ke liye aarthik anivaarytaayen bilkul saaf thiah desh ke naujavaanon or badhate berozegaron ke liye naukariyon or rojgaar kaa jugad karne kii jarurat he
 There is a need to revive the agricultural sector from a huge crisis and increase yields and arouse possibilities
 swasthya or shiksha jaise mukhya saamaajik kshetron main fouran sudhaar kii darkaar thi, taaki hunarmand or swasth kaarybal taiyaar ho sake
 If Modi wanted to keep the promise of a "good day" that would bring power, then he had to adopt measures to speed up the rate of economic growth by encouraging private sector investment and exports
 or yah sab aise karnaa tha jisase ki koi vah na kahe, jise ek salaahkaar ne ''yaarana samaajwaad" yaa ''daagdar poonjeevaad" kaa najariya bataaya he
 Political compulsions were even more vigorous and immediate
 india today or duusare taaja janamat surveykshanon se pataa chalaa tha ki modi kii nijee lokapriyata to buland he magar unki sarkaar kii chhavi khaskar aarthik morche par giravat kii vajah se dhire-dhire ghota lagane lagi he
 If the Bharatiya Janata Party is to retain its majority in the next general election, it will have to win the hearts of large sections of the population
 khaskar naaraaz kisaanon or khetihar mazdooron ko khush karnaa hoga, jo sabase bada kaarybal or matadaata varg he
 Modi also needed to arouse sympathy among other sections of the population among youth, women, tribals, Dalits and small businessmen, who contribute significantly to the vote count
 yah sab karte hue unhen yah bhi sabit karnaa tha ki unamem sangh parivaar ke liye hindutv vaale bharat ko saakaar karne kii kaabiliyat he
 Modi has no half-hearted measures
 ve jo kuch bhi karte hai, usamen bahadur, nidar or behichak dikhnaa chaahate hai lekin yah bahut saare logon ke liye pareshaan karne vaala bhi ho saktaa he
 Therefore, the budget 2018 is bold because Modi has left no stone unturned to woo farmers by promising one and a half times increase in the minimum support price of various crops
 unki team ne khaskar khaadya prasanskaran or bagbani ke vaaste infrastracchar main ijapha karke behad jaruri krishi sudhaaron ko sambhav banane ke liye kaaphi rakam chhod rakhi he
 This was also an act of courage because these steps could increase inflation, which is willing to raise the risks arising from the Prime Minister
 isliye bhi ki ve korporate tex na ghataakar or dderghaavadhik nivesh ke liye puunjigat laabh (capital gens) tex laakar bade audyogic gharaanon kii naaraazgi jhelane ko taiyaar hai
 Also, he did not make any concession for the dominant middle class
 bajet hikvamat vaala isliye he kyonki usamen duniya kii sabase badi swasthya beemaa yojana ''ayushmaan bharat" kii shuruyaat kii gai
 Under this scheme, the government provides about Rs 5 lakh for the 10 crore needy families
 tak kaa salanaa medical kharch uthaaegi
 The objective behind the relief of 100 million families is to reach 50 crore members of those families
 centre sarkaar ne madhyavarg ke liye bahut lokapriy faisle na lekar spasht kar diya he ki uski najar matadaataaon ke bahut bade varg par tiki hui he jo ki desh kii aabaadi kaa aadhe se thodaa kam he
 But it is also worrying because it threatens Modi's image to become a populist reformer
 jis anhoni kaa andeshaa he, vah he petroleum utpaadon kii keemton main badhotaree
 The falling crude oil prices during the first three years of the Modi government allowed him to invest in several infrastructure and welfare schemes and maintain the fiscal balance
 magar tel kii keemton main oochaal jari rahati he to rajasav kii kami se garib or kisaanon ko khayraat dene kii unki yojanaayen hi nahin prabhavit ho sakati hai, balki byaaj daron main badhotaree ke saath mahangaai ke bekaabu hone kaa bhi khatra he
 At the moment, crude oil prices remain at a level
 modi rojgaar or nijee nivesh ko badhaakar aarthik vruddhi dar tej karne ke liye infrastracchar khaskar transport or awaas ke kshetra main apni sarkaar ke baari nivesh par bharosa kar rahe hai
 But there can be many challenges like double balance sheet 
 matlab yah ki kai korporate gharaane baari karj main duube hai or bainkon par duubat karj yaa gaiyr-nishpadit sampattiyon (enpie) kaa baari boj he
 These have been given due consideration, but it may take some time to get comfortable
 iske saath atirikt jokhim yah bhi he ki is bajet main ghoshit badi yojanaayen bhi sarkaar ke liye mushkil kaa sabab ho sakati hai
 Hence, heavy resentment may arise and there may be a dent in their chances of winning the re-election
 isliye jokhim baari he or uskaa puraskaar bhi joardaar, lekin, jaisaa ki kaha jaataa he, bhavishya bahaduron kaa hi saath detaa he
 There is no doubt that in Budget 2018, Modi has shown that ability without fear
 *** Balabrahmachari Hanuman gives the boon of marriage, but for this, the devotees have to worship on 5 Tuesday
 jhaansi main maujuud mudrika hanuman ke darshan pujan se bhakton ko jald vivaah kaa vardaan mil jaataa he
 Like other temples here, there is praise of Hanuman ji with drums, chains, and the aarti of Bajrangbali is sought after praying
 donon haath jod, aankh band karke bhakt apane aradhya kaa samaran karte hai or phir khud ba khud bajrangbali ke charnon main unka sheesh jhuk jaataa he
 This is the glory of Baba Hanuman, situated just a short distance away from Jhansi, where the first rays of the sun do not fall on the earth that huge crowds of devotees thrive
 vaise to yahaan prabhu ke darshan ke liye berokatoke koi bhi aa saktaa he lekin yahaan aanevaale bhakton main mahilaon or ladakiyon kii taadaad sabase zyada hoti he
 It is believed that Hanuman ji sees every Mahila devotee visiting his temple as his mother
 aakhir mudrika dhari hanuman kii kahani bhi to maa sita se hi judi he
 Here, the idol of Hanuman ji holding the ring in his hand is reminiscent of the time when on the orders of Lord Rama, he took the ring and went out to search for mother-sita and took her ring as a token from her lord
 jab hanuman ji mata sita ko khojate hue lanka kii ashok vatika main pahunche to vahaan unka ksht dekhakar unka rome-rome kaanp uthaa, unka haath khud ba khud seene par chalaa gaya or unke muh se aah nikal gai
 It is said that this temple of Jhansi represents the same form of Hanuman ji
 yahaan hanuman ji kii murti ko chune kii ijaajat kisi ko nahin he
 There are eight windows and four doors around the temple from which Hanuman ji can be seen
 isliye inhen dur ke baba bhi kaha jaataa he
 Even though the devotees do not get the pleasure of touching the feet of Hanuman ji, but the worship of sincere mind gives them the boon of Bajrangbali
 khaas taur par manachaahe jeevanasathi or santan sukh kaa aashirwad jarur dete hai pavanputra
 Whatever devotee women come to this temple, God fulfills their wishes
 yahaan par 5 mangalvaar aane se bhakton ko jeevanasathi kaa vardaan miltaa he
 That is why devotees definitely come here at least five Tuesdays
 bhakt yahaan chane, ilaychi dane kaa prasad chadhaakar puri shraddha or bhakthi se bhagwaan kii puja karte hai or kaamana puri hone par yahaan aana kabhi nahin bhoolatey
 If the amount of salt in the food becomes more, then the whole taste of the food gets spoiled
 usee tarah agar sharir main zyada maatra main namak jane lage to yah sehat ko kai tarah se nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 Consumption of salt in excess increases the calories in the body, which works to increase the risk of cancer
 iske alaava zyada namak khaane se sehat ko hote hai ye chaar nuksaan
 
 
 1
 bana na de dil ko bimaaranmak kaa zyada seven dil kii bimariyon ke khatre ko badha detaa he
 Therefore, to keep the heart healthy, keep a balance of the amount of salt in the food
 2
 Do not spoil blood pressure experts believe that more salt causes high BP, so add less salt to your food
 agar kabhi bhi khaane main namak kam lage to ise alag se khaane main daalkar seven karne se bachein
 3
 dihydration kii samasyasharir main zyada namak kii maatra cedihydration kii samasyaho sakati he
 For the problem of dehydration in the body, you should take a balanced amount of salt and drink plenty of water
 4
 Swelling can increase in the body, when the amount of salt in the body is high, water accumulates excessively
 yah sthiti waterritansion yaa flud ritensionakhalaati he
 In such a situation there is swelling of hands, feet and face

 videokon lone maamle main sibiai ne deepak kochar ke khilaaf praarambhik jaanch shuru kar di he
 The CBI started the investigation process against Deepak Kochhar on Friday after reports of alleged involvement of Kochhar and his family members in a loan case given to Videocon Group
 sibiai ke ek adhikari ne ajtak ko bataaya ki sabhi adhikariyon jinka lone paas karaane main yogadan tha, unke bayaan darj kar liye gaye hai
 Apart from this, the CBI has also seized all the documents related to this loan, which are being studied
 ab sibiai deepak kochar ko poochtacha ke liye bula sakati he
 Apart from Deepak, the CBI can also interrogate important people of Videocon Group
 yah poochtacha sibiai kii bank frod and security wing karegi
 However, as per the rules, the CBI cannot issue an official notice during the initial investigation, but can inquire if necessary
 praarambhik jaanch ke tahat is baat kaa pataa lagaaya jayega ki deepak kochar or unke do rishtedaaron dwaara banaai gai form ko videokon samooh ke venugopal dhoot ne rishwat ke rup main kitne rupee die
 There will also be an investigation into the allegations, which are said to have been leased by the ICICI Bank loan assistance to Videocon Group and alleged involvement of Kochhar and some of his family members
 4000 karod ke lone main hera-pheri kaa aropadarasal, ICICI bank or videokon group ke niveshak arvind gupta ne chanda kochar par aarope lagaaya tha ki kochar ne videocone ko kul 4000 karod rupye ke do rin manjuur karne ke badale main galat tareeke se nijee laabh liya
 According to information lodged in the Registrar of Companies, Deepak Kochhar, husband of ICICI Bank Chief Chanda Kochhar, together with Dhoot, formed a company in December 2008 in the name of New Power Renewables Private Limited (NRPL)
 NRPL main dhoot, unke parivaar ke sadasyon or karibiyon ke 50 fisadi share the
 The remaining shares were held by Chanda Kochhar's husband Deepak Kochhar and Pacific Capital
 paisefic capital kaa swamitva deepak kochar ke parivaar ke paas hi tha
 a year later in January 2009, Dhoot resigned from the post of Director of NRPL and transferred about 25000 of his shares to Deepak Kochhar
 march 2010 main NRPL ko supreme energy privet limited se lone mila jo ki dhoot kii hi company thi
 By the end of March 2010, Supreme Energy took control of most of the NRPL
 deepak kochar ke paas 5 fisadi share hi rah gaye
 After about 8 months, Dhoot transferred all his holding in Supreme Energy to his associate Mahesh Chandra Punglia
 do saal baad pungalia ne supreme energy main apana sara steke deepak kochar kii pinekal energy ko 9 lakh rupye main de diya
 a loan of Rs 3250 crore in 2012, Arvind Gupta told India Today, 'we need to know why Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot formed a joint venture and then Dhoot left it
 hamen jaanane kii jarurat he ki mauritian company (d rinuables) ke peeche asal main koun log hai
 The reason for Gupta's suspicion is that NRPL is getting foreign funds in abundance at the same time
 ICICI bank ne kareeb 4000 karod rupye rin ke taur par videocone group ko 2010 se 2012 ke bich die or d rinuables ne 325 karod or 66 karod rupye NRPL main daale
 ICICI Bank gave 3250 crore 5 Videocon companies in April 2012
 iske baad camen islands kii ek shail company ko 660 karod rupye kaa rin diya gaya
 SEBI may also tighten its grip on ICICI Bank Amidst the controversy surrounding ICICI Bank, market regulator Sebi has started to see if there is any issue related to publication of information or company operations in this matter

 At the same time, the stock market may also ask for additional clarification regarding the recent reports regarding some deals up to 2012

 Describing the new US Defense Minister Chuck Hagle's statement of funding for the problems posed by Pakistan through Afghanistan through India as baseless, the BJP said the government should put diplomatic pressure on the US to withdraw Hagel's statement unconditionally 
 bhaajapa ke pravaktaa rajeev pratap rudi ne kaha ki hagal kaa yah bayaan betuka or bebuniyaad he ki bharat ne afghanistan ke madhyam se pakistan main utpann samasyaon ke liye vittaposhan kiya he
 Rudy also expressed surprise at Hegel's statement of giving a clean chit to Pakistan
 pakistan ne hi alqaida pramukh osama- bin-laden ko sharan di, jo world trade centre par aatankwaadi hamale main 5000 se adhik americanyon ke maare jane ke liye jimmedaar he
 He said, BJP is worried about the Government of India's stand not reacting to Hegel's statement
 bhaajapa maang karti he ki bharat sarkaar ko is baat ke liye rajanyik dabaav bananaa chahie ki chak hagal bina shart apane bayaan ko waapas len
 a former Republican Senate member said in 2011 while giving a speech at Cameron University in Oklahoma, India has always used Afghanistan as the second front of war for some time and India has for years crossed the border to Pakistan
 Financed to create problems

 Yes 
 
 
 
 # Metoo 
 
 
 
 
 Sharing a post like this and joining the global awareness on sexual assaults on women all over the world and showing solidarity to each and every woman who sailed on the same boat, shows the magnitude of the problem
 m surprised that some 'good ' men are shocked to see the number of women who have come out and shared their # metoo experiences
 NO DON'T BE
 This is happening in your own backyard, in your own house, with your own sister, daughter , mother, wife or even your maid 
 
 
 Gain their trusts and ask them
 You will be surprised at their answers
 
 You will be surprised with their stories
 
 Writing something like this brings me to tears reliving those memories as a little girl when i was scared of the neighbourhood uncle and his prying eyes who at any given opportunity would grope me and threaten me not to speak about this to anyone 
 
 
 
 
 OR my much older cousins who would eye me differently than their own daughters
 
 
 
 OR the man who saw me at the hospital when i was born and 13 years later he thought it appropriate for him to touch my body because i was a growing teenager and my body had changed
 
 
 
 OR my tuition teacher who had his hands in my underpants
 
 
 
 
 
 
 OR this another teacher , whom i tied Rakhi to, would scold the female students in the class by pulling their bra straps and slapping on their breasts 
 
 
 
 
 OR that man in the train station who gropes U
 
 
 Why ?? Because you're too young and scared to speak up
 So scared that you can feel your stomach getting twisted inside and throat getting choked up
 
 
 you don't know how are you going to explain it to your parents or you're too shy to utter a word to anyone 
 
 
 
 And then you start developing that deep rooted hatred towards men 
 
 
 Because you know they're the culprit who made you feel this way
 
 That disgusting, twisted feeling inside which takes years to overcome
 
 
 
 m happy to be another voice joining this movement and make people realize that i was not spared either
 But TODAY i will rip apart any man who even remotely tries anything on me
 i AM PROUD OF WHO i AM

 com dilli ke dhaula kuan ke paas ravivaar der raat kareeb ek mahila par do logon ne jaanaleva hamalaa kiya
 The woman alleges that miscreants shot her five rounds
 police maamle kii jaanch main juty he
 According to the woman, she went to the gurudwara on Sunday and was returning alone from her car at night
 jab wo dhaula kuan ke paas baraar squaire pahunchi tabhi skuti par baithe ek shaks ne use rukne kaa ishaara kiya
 The woman says that she felt that her car was punctured, she took the car to the side to show it
 tabhi skuti bhi vahaan rukii or peeche baitha shaks uski gaadi ke paas aakar jor jor se gaali dene laga
 After which the woman got nervous and tried to take the car
 usne mahila kaa target kar goli chalaai
 But he escaped because of reversing the car
 iske baad bhi us shaks ne mahila kii car par chaar or goliyaan chalaayin, is bich goliyon kii aawaaj sunakar maukey kii taraf jab log daude to badmaash fouran skuti se bhaag nikle
 Although both the miscreants were wearing helmets, they could not identify them
 lekin mahila kaa daawa he ki jis shaks ne un par goli chalaai use wo saamne aane par pahchaan sakati hai
 The victim told that on April 4, she had filed a case of rape, cheating and blackmailing a person
 unhen shaq he ki is hamale ke peeche wo log shaamil ho sakate hai
 The woman said that when the crook was abusing, he was constantly saying that take the case back
 police ne is maamle main shikaayat darj kar lee he or maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Police say the woman's allegations are being investigated
 china ke raashtrapati shi jinping ne saal 2013 main van belt van road pariyojna kaa idia pesh karne ke saath hi bharat ko isamen shaamil karne kii yojana bana lee thi
 Therefore, China had pressurized the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh many times to join the project
 haalanki bharat shuru se hi van belt van road (OBOR) yani new silk road pariyojna ke tahat ban rahe china-pakistan aarthik galiyare (CPEC) ke khilaaf he
 The then UPA government had also opposed the CPEC project passing through Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (pok), but the stance of the Manmohan government was softer than the Modi government
 yahi vajah thi ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke satta main aate hi OBOR pariyojna ko lekar china kii chintaa bad gai thi
 India considers China's CPEC project in pok a violation of its sovereignty
 manmohan singh ke pradhanmantri rahane ke dauraan farvari 2014 main china ne kaha tha ki bharat van belt van road pariyojna main shaamil hone ke liye taiyaar he
 However, there was no response from the UPA government and the then PM Manmohan Singh had kept silence
 isaki sabase badi vajah yah thi ki manmohan singh bhi china kii ranneeti ko sandesh se dekhte the
 After this, the Modi government came to power and took a strong stand on CPEC and refused to join One Belt One Road Pariona
 is par china ne pradhanmantri modi par apni purvavarti sarkaar ke faisle ko ulatney kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 The Chinese government newspaper Global Times said in an article published on August 3, 2016 that when the idea of one Belt One Road project was proposed by China in 2013, then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon supported it
 
 iske saath hi is pariyojna main dilchaspee dikhaai thi, lekin maujuuda piem modi ne is masale par bharat kaa rukh mode diya
 The Chinese newspaper also alleged that the Modi government was distancing itself from the agenda of economic development for the provocation of European countries and for its political purpose
 uskaa kahana he ki europea desh van belt van road pariyojna ko string of parl yani bharat ko samudri maarg se gherne kii chini sajeesh bataa rahe hai, jiske chalate bharat china ko andeh kii najar se dekh rahaa he
 Did India not take part in isolating PAK? Despite the pressure from China, India did not participate in One Belt One Road Summit, due to which now questions are being asked whether this decision of India is right? Some experts say that India made a distance from this summit in the process of isolating Pakistan
 inkaa kahana he ki bharat ko japan se sikhte hue is summit main apane rajanyikon ko bhejnaa chahie tha, taaki bharat china kii manshaa or aarthik agenda main apane hit ko bhaleebhanti samaj paata
 They say that China's technologies are very advanced
 aise main agar bharat chini technology ko apanaakar vikaas ke kshetra main aage badhata he, to isamen koi buraai nahin he
 They say that other neighboring countries of India including Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar are participating in this summit
 aise main bharat ko isse kinaaraa nahin kaatna chahie
 China will not be successful without China
 Some experts are also saying that China will not be able to execute its project without including India
 iske alaava yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he kichin kii is pariyojna kaa makasad chini prabhutv badhanaa he
 Through this project, China will be able to supply its products, which will boost its economy
 china is pariyojna main duusare deshon kii companiyon ko tender bhi aavantit karne ke mood main nahin he
 Even if it had to tender under pressure, the majority would go to the account of Chinese companies
 OBOR summit main hissaa le rahe europea deshon ne bhi is par andeh jataayaa he
 Apart from this, China also believes that it is difficult to reach this project without involving India
 yahi vajah rahi kiwan belt van rodsummit main bharat kii gaiyr maujuudagi charchaa kaa vishay rahi
 However, China is also saying that India's inclusion will not affect its project
 lihaaja vah bharat par iske liye dabaav nahin banayega
 Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar on Sunday blamed Congress President Sonia Gandhi and party Vice President Rahul Gandhi directly for the deadlock that had been going on for the last two weeks in the Monsoon session of Parliament
 unhone kaha ki congress ke 'adiyal ravaiye' se sansad chal nahin paa rahi he, jisase karadaataaon ke karodon rupee barbaad ho rahe hai
 Javadekar told reporters after taking part in bjp's state-level training program in Indore, 'sonia and Rahul Gandhi are responsible for disrupting Parliament
 is tarah sansad baadhit karnaa loktantr kii avmaananaa he
 Millions of rupees of taxpayers are being wasted due to the absence of Parliament
 ' He said, 'it seems that the Congress has not yet recovered from the defeat of the last Lok Sabha elections
 isliye vah bagaiyr kisi kaaran ke sansad baadhit kar rahi he, jabaki sarkaar sadan main har mudde par charchaa ke liye taiyaar he
 ' jaavdekar ne kaha, 'congress jab satta main thi, tab bhi vah sansad main charchaa se bhaagti thi or uski vajah se sansad baadhit hoti thi
 Now Congress is in opposition
 lekin ab bhi usee ke adiyal ravaiye kii vajah se sansad nahin chal paa rahi he
 This situation is fatal for the country
 'tippaniyan The Union Minister said, "I hope that in the all-party meeting convened on Monday to end the deadlock of Parliament, the collective conscience of Congress and other opposition parties will be awakened and they will allow Parliament to run for the rest of the monsoon session
" ' Apart from this, Javadekar said that the BJP has planned to get accident insurance policy on behalf of 11,000 brothers in every assembly constituency of the country as a gift to their sisters on the upcoming festival of Rakshabandhan
 unhone kaha, 'bijepi kii is yojana se mahilaon ko badi sankhya main durghatana beemaa kii suvidha ke daayre main laayaa ja sakegaa
 ' jaavdekar ne indore main bijepi ke pradeshstareey prashikshan kaarykram main hissaa lene ke baad samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'sansad baadhit karne ke liye sonia or rahul gandhi jimmedaar hai
