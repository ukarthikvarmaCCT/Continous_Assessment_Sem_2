 The Supreme Court has agreed to a hearing in the case and will test whether women can be allowed to offer Namaz with everyone in the mosque
 court ne is maamle mencendre sarkaar, central vakf council or muslim personal lau board ko notice bhi jari kiya he
 During the hearing, the Supreme Court asked the petitioner that it was the duty of the state to grant the right but could any person (non-state actor) demand the right of equality from another person under Article 14 of the Constitution? What state is the mosque or church and where is the state involved in this case? The court said that we are hearing this matter because of Sabarimala
 duusari taraf, yachikakarta kii ore se kaha gaya ki masjidon ko sarkaar dwaara grant va laabh die jate hai
 During the hearing, the Supreme Court asked the petitioner whether women were being given entry in Haji Ali Dargah, but what is the arrangement in Mecca and what is the arrangement in mosques around the world? Let us tell you that the petition of Maharashtra couple Yasmin Zubeer Ahmad Peerzada and Zubeer Ahmad Peerzada has demanded the right of equality on the basis of gender also on the lines of Sabarimala
 yachika main samvidhan ke anuchhed 14,15,21, 15 or 29 kaa bhi hawala diya gaya he
 The petition mentions the basic premise of Islam i
e
 the Quran and Hazrat Muhammad Sahab that he never differentiated between men
 baat sirf aqide yani shraddha or imaan kii kii he
 The Quran and Hazrat never opposed offering prayers in the mosque of women, but those who interpreted Islam on the basis of the Quran started discriminating against women
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki maujuuda daur main kuch masjidon main jahaan auraton ko namaaz adaa karne kii chhot he bhi ,vahaan unke aane jane ke darvaaze hi nahin namaaz adaa karne kii jagah bhi alag hoti he

 23-year-old Savita died in a large hospital in Delhi last night
 swine flu hua tha use
 His father was in Delhi only
 maheenabhar pehle yahaan se apane sasuraal gai to halakaa zukam tha use
 Gradually phlegm and cough increased
 jaanaleva infections sebachane ke liye har tarah kaa ilaaj hua, lekin use bachaaya nahin ja sakaa
 And Savita became one of the 663 people who passed away due to this disease
 savita or uske parivaar kaa sangharshashayad un das hajaar logon kii daastaan bhiho saktaa he, jo is beemaari se jujh rahe hai
 Savita was married two years ago in Saharanpur
 ek rasukhdaar parivaar main
 Successful businessman and active in politics
 savita ne salbhar pehle ek bete ko janm diya
 Savita was pregnant again
 pichley dinon dilli ke silampur ai thi
 His parents live here
 silampur ilaake main kai logon ko swine flu kaa infections hua tha
 The virus of this disease also caught Savita
 vah sardi-zukam ke saath saharanpur laut gai
 She used to take home treatment first, assuming a minor cold
 uskaa parivaar sochataa rahaa ki ve to acha khaanaa khate hai or behatar jivan jite hai
 How could something happen to his family? swine flu to kalpana main bhi nahin tha
 Savita's problems increased
 bukhaar aa gaya
 a week later was taken to the doctor
 doctor ko shankaa hui
 Savita was hospitalized
 swine flu test karaayaa gaya
 Unfortunately he came positive
 bas yaheen se twist aa gaya
 Till the time people did not know that the sick daughter-in-law of the family had swine flu, then the line of people coming to the hospital every day was busy
 phir sab achaanak tham gaya
 This family never even dreamed that neighbors or relatives who are desperate to come to their house all the time or leave no chance to call them, they will make such a distance from them
 doctor ne jaise hi swine flu kii pushti kii to padosi, rishtedaar, dost sab achaanak gaayab se ho gaye
 If he did not handle the matter with the doctor, he referred Savita to Delhi without delay
 sirf pati sudhir saath tha ambulance main uske is safar main
 Savita was admitted to Sir Gangaram Hospital in Delhi
 savita ke dilli chale jane ke baad bhi log uske ghar aane main anakani karte rahe
 Even if people asked if they were on the phone
 padosiyon main to ajeeb si dehshat thi
 Do not let swine flu attack in their home anywhere
 unke bacchon ke saath koi khilne nahin aa rahaa tha
 Undeclared social boycott
 udhar, aspataal main koi bhi doctor sudhir ko ye bataane ko taiyaar nahin tha ki aakhir chal kya rahaa he
 Staff also kept distance
 bas har din moti rakam lee jaati rahi
 Every time it was said that treatment was going on
 kisi privet aspataal ke stoff kaa ye ravaiya dekhakar wo bhi hairaan tha
 But whom to say
 na parivaar kaa koi saath tha or na dost
 Savita's condition worsened
 usne bolchaal band kar di
 As a last-ditch effort, he was supported with a ventilator
 das din tak vah usee life saport system par rahi
 Since Savita was pregnant, about 12 days later, the doctors said to have an operation
 oparation hua
 And also the end of Savita
 darasal, is dukhad vaakye ke peeche jimmedaar sab rahe
 
 
 Savita, her family
 or ab aage aane vaale halaaton ke liye padosi or dost bhi
 Savita was healthy when she came to her maternal home
 jab aasapaas swine flu failaa hua tha, to use yah galatfahami kaise ho gai ki use infections nahin ho saktaa
 Doctors and the government are vigorously promoting that pregnant women, children and old people are becoming easy victims of swine flu
 itnaa hi nahin, jaanaleva swine flu kaa shuruaati lakshan saamaanya zukam ke rup main hi saamne aata he
 Now the way the neighbors have distanced themselves from this family, they are deprived of knowing where Savita's life was lacking that she had to leave the untimely world
 unhen yah ab bhi samaj nahin aayega ki dar ke kaaran ghar main khud ko band karne se nahin, balki vaxin lagavane se is beemaari se bachaa ja sakegaa
 This incident reminds us of decades when TB was an incurable and spreading disease
 log jane-anjaane tibi ke marijon se aisa vyavhaar karte the, jis par ab tajjub kiya jaataa he
 But there is still nothing to change
 infosis technolajeej ke mukhya sangrakshak en aar narayanamurthi ko is baat kaa kshobh he ki sambhraant yaa ucch varg ke log desh main ‘bade aparaadh’ karne ke baad bhi sajaa se bache rahete hai
 He said that this is a big problem of the society
 desh main bade logon dwaara kiye ja rahe aparaadhon ke bare main puche jane par narayanamurthi ne kaha ki aankadon or tathyon ke aadhaar par aise maamalon kii teji se jaanch honi chahie or media ko ise zyada tool nahin dena chahie
 He said that strict punishment should be given in such crimes
 ‘jab aap teji se kadi sajaa dilaayenge, to sab kuch thik ho jayega
 'narayan Murthy said,' Today there are many cases where the upper class people, they have committed a big crime but still remain from punishment
 yah hamaare samaaj kii ek badi samasya he
 Narayan Murthy said these things in response to questions from reporters after a discussion on the topic 'entrepreneurship and Social Change' on Tuesday night at the Infosys campus to mark the ten years of Hyderabad's Indian School of Business
 haalanki unhone kisi vishesh maamle kaa zikr nahin kiya, par unka yah bayaan aise samay aayaa he jab desh kii raajnneeti main bhrashtachar se jude maamalon ko lekar hangaamaa machaa hua
 He said that there should be a code of conduct for all types of businesses
 narayanamurthi ne kaha, ‘beshak ghotaale hon yaa na hon, sabase mahatvapurn yah he ki aap apana kaarobaar kanoonee tareekon or naitikta ke saath chalaaen
 This is the only way to run any business
 iske or tareeke nahin hai
 'he said that it is very important that the code of ethics be followed
 yah kuch is tarah se he, ‘jab sadak par driving karata hum, to niyamon kaa paalan karata hum
 It is good for you, for others, for everyone
 ’bhrashtachar se muqabla kis tarah kiya ja saktaa he, is par unhone kaha, ‘hamen zyada paardarshee or eemaandaar bananaa hoga
 More open rules will have to be made and implemented, so that you know that there is no possibility of corruption

 ’ Kamal Nath is a strong leader of the Congress
 madhya pradesh kaa mukhyamantri banane se pehle ve 9 baar loksabhaa ke liye chune gaye
 He is the senior-most leader in the Lok Sabha
 apane political kariyar main ve sirf ek baar hi ellection haare hai
 The reason for this defeat is very interesting
 darasal, ye haar unhen isliye mili ki unhen dilli ke ek khaas bangale ko khaali na karnaa pade
 Now Kamal Nath has become the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh
 aise main ve bangale ko khaali karenge yaa phir koi or tarika nikaalenge, ye dekhne vaali baat hogi
 Even after winning 4 consecutive elections, Kamal Nath was not given a ticket by the Congress party after being named in the Hawala incident in 1996
 tab kamalnath ne patni alkanath ko chunaav ladaaya
 His wife won this election
 lekin uske baad kamalnath ko dilli main saansad na rahane ke kaaran lutiuns jone vaala bangala khaali karne kaa notice mila
 Kamal Nath tried hard to get the bungalow allotted to his wife
 lekin unki patni pehali baar saansad baniin thim, jiske kaaran bada bangala nahin mil sakaa
 Kamal Nath was not willing to leave this bungalow at any cost
 bangale ke liye unhone apni patni kaa sansad se istipha dilava diya
 After this, in the 1997 by-election, bjp's Sunderlal Patwa himself contested
 patwa ne ye chunaav ladaa or kamalnath ko unheen ke garh main maat de di
 Elections were again held the following year in 1998
 tab kamalnath ne patwa ko haraakar jeet hasil kii
 After that, he did not have the opportunity to vacate this bungalow
 lekin ab phir se vahi sameekaran ban rahe hai
 Actually, this bungalow is allotted to the MP
 ab mukhyamantri banane ke baad unhen is bangale ko khaali karnaa hoga
 In such a situation, it will also be seen that those who lose the bungalow for the first time in life, will leave it or else find a way to keep it with them
 34 saal kii umr main jeeta pehla chunaavkamalnath 9 baar loksabhaa ke liye chune ja chuke hai
 He won elections for the first time from Chhindwara in 1980 at the age of 34 which continues till now
 kamalnath 1985, 1989, 1991 main lagaataar chunaav jite
 From 1991 to 1995 he held the Ministry of Environment in the Narasimha Rao government
 vahiin 1995 se 1996 tak ve kapadaa mantri rahe
 Kamal Nath also won the 1998 and 1999 elections
 lagaataar jeet hasil karne se kamalnath kaa congress main kad badhata gaya or 2001 main unhen mahasachiv banaaya gaya
 He remained the General Secretary of the party till 2004
 chhindwara main to jeet kaa doosraa naam kamalnath ho gaye or 2004 main unhone ek baar phir jeet hasil kii
 This was his 7th consecutive win
 gandhi parivaar kaa sabase kareebi hone kaa inaam bhi unako miltaa rahaa or is baar manmohan singh kii sarkaar main ve phir mantri bane or is baar unhen vaanijya mantralay mila
 He held this important ministry for the entire 5 years in the UPA-I government
 iske baad 2009 main chunaav hua or ek baar phir congress kaa yah diggaj netaa loksabhaa ke liye chunaa gaya
 This 'lotus' of the Congress continued to bloom in Chhindwara and this time under the Manmohan Singh government, he got the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways
 saal 2012 main kamalnath sansadeey kaarymantri bane
 The important responsibility that was given in Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath is counted among those Congress leaders who are always with the party even in times of crisis
 chaahe wo rajeev gandhi kaa nidhan ho, 1996 se lekar 2004 tak jis sankat se congress guzar rahi thi, is dauraan bhi vah party ke saath rahe wo bhi tab jab sharad pavaar jaise diggaj netaaon ne party kaa saath chhod diya tha
 He became the President of Madhya Pradesh Congress on 26 April 2018
 unhen arun yadav kii jagah adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 Aam Aadmi Party held a press conference in this regard
 AAP netaa ashish khetaan ne sachivalay main apane saath hui badasluki kaa khulaasa kiya
 He said that a large number of people shouted slogans
 unhone bataaya, '150 logon kaa hujum tha jo apane aap main hi chaunkaane vaali baat he
 i was waiting for the lift when 30 to 35 people came chanting slogans
 khetaan ne bataaya, '30 log meri taraf bhaage or bhartiya janata party jindabad ke naare lagaae gaye
 The crowd in the rear elevator tried to get inside

 Minister Imran Hussain was also assaulted, Ashish Khaitan alleged that Minister Imran Hussain was assaulted in the secretariat
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki dilli sachivalay jahaan se sarkaar chalati he, jahaan par CM baithte hai, vahaan dilli police dwaara un gundon ko hataane ke liye koi kadam nahin uthaaya gaya
 This video clearly shows how some goons in the secretariat have surrounded and killed Minister Imran Hussain and his partner Himanshu! Pic

 haryana ke rewadi main lagaataar kai dinon tak dharne pradarshan kar apane skool ko apgrade karwaane vaali chatraayen ek baar phir system se haar gai hai
 Under the pressure of the media, the government upgraded the school, but if no teacher reached the school for a year, many of the girl students gave up studying due to exhaustion
 haryana kii dharti se hipradhanmantri modine beti bachaao or beti padhaao kaa naaraa diya tha
 But the manner in which the government is working to teach daughters in this state is disappointing
 is baat kaa andaja aap isi se laga sakate hai ki jab ladakiyon ne chhedchhad se tang aakar apane hi gaanv ke skool ko apgrade karne ke liye kai dinon tak dharna pradarshan kiya to sarkaar dabaav main ai or skool ko kaagajon main apgrade bhi kar diya gaya
 But these students did not get any teacher
 isi kaaran kai chaatraon ne padhai chhod di, to kuch kaaphi dur jaakar pard rahi hai
 On this situation, the people of the village say that these girls not only have talent to study, but if they get an opportunity, then they can also achieve great achievements in the field of sports for the country and the state
 lekin inaki majaburi he ki inke paas kisi tarah ke naa sansaadhan he or naa hi dur jane ke liye kisi tarah kii suraksha
 When these girls go to study in a remote village, the people of the village are forced to come forward to protect their daughters
 darasal sachai yah he ki gaanv kaa skool jab sirf dasvin tak tha us samay main bhi teacher or staff kii kami thi
 Now that the government has upgraded this school to 12th standard on paper, not a single teacher has arrived here
 lihaaja majaburi aisi he ki jin chaatraon ne skool ko apgrade karwaane ke liye kai dinon tak andolan kiya tha, vah chatraayen majaburi main is skool se apane transfar certificate lekar ja chuki hai

 In such a situation, if the MCD is not able to pay them for three months, then its message should go

 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) sent a good message to BJP President Amit Shah for the sixth consecutive victory in Gujarat: "small business victory is also important, greetings to all
 " is behad sankshipt shubhakamana sandesh main alp vyap (chota dayera) aisa he jo na to party ke liye ullas kaa vishay he, na hi sangh kii doorgaami ranneeti ke anukool
 The major concern of the party and perhaps the Sangh is that the scope of victory is limited, the opposition has occupied the vacant space
 sangh ke sandesh ke nihitarth kii ore sanket karte hue bhaajapa ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''yah saaf sanket he ki janamanas ek majboot vikalp ke swaagat ko taiyaar he or aashaa kii choti-si kiran dekh janata kisi netaa or dal ko majboot vikalp ke rup main dekhne lagati he
 This is the real crisis
 "sangh ke is shubhakamana sandesh ne bhaajapa ko is kadar pareshaan kiya he ki party main koi bhi kuch kehane ko taiyaar nahin he
 After a long time there is a strange silence in the party
 bhaajapa sutron ke mutabik gujarat chunaav nateezon par sangh kii ''alp vyap vijay (kam siton vaali jeet)" pratikriya se saaf he ki sangh ko yah lagane laga he ki bhaajapa kaa ek bada paramparaagat samarthak varg usase vimukh hone laga he
 The figures testify to this
 bhaajapa ko jeet bhale mili magar lagbhag aadhe gujarat main party gaayab ho gai he
 In 15 of the total 33 districts, the BJP has been almost wiped out
 7 jilon main bhaajapa apana khaataa tak nahin khol saki
 There are 21 assembly seats in these 7 districts
 anya aath jilon main bhaajapa sirf 8 seat jeet saki jabaki in jilon main kul 26 vidhansabha seat hai
 In this way, BJP could win only 8 seats in 15 districts
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad gujarat main do chunaav hue hai
 Panchayat and local body elections and now assembly elections
 in donon chunaavon main gramin ilaake main bhaajapa kii haar hui he
 There are indications that the rural section has alienated from the BJP in large numbers
 shahari kshetra jarur abhi bhi bhaajapa ke paale main hai magar vahaan bhi naaraazgi kam nahin he
 In fact, the reason for the concern of the Sangh could also be that Gujarat was being called its laboratory for a long time
 yani vahaan kii naaraazgi kaa asar baaki jagah bhi dikhne lag saktaa he
 According to a BJP leader, a large section of the society has seen the BJP as a decent, ideological party, respecting workers and adhering to linguistic dignity
 ve kehete hai, ''lekin pichley teen varshon main party ke is majboot charitragat aadhaar main lagaataar hraas dikhaa he
 Election has increased in the party leaders, when the limit of linguistic dignity has expired
 "iskaa sabase bada saboot he ki gujarat main amit shah or pradhanmantri narendra modi tak ko apane paramparaagat votaron se sampark kar unase party ke liye samarthan dene kaa aagrah karnaa padaa
 "congress president Rahul Gandhi has been able to fill the void created by dropping grace and linguistic decorum," says a RSS pracharak associated with the Sangh
 " shaayad unka ishaara is ore he ki congress ke kuch netaaon ne amaryadit tippaniyan kin to rahul ne un par fouran karrwai kii, isse unki chhavi shaleen bani
 Why this, Rahul's gracious and restrained language was the subject of discussion throughout the campaign
 sangh ke ek anya netaa ke mutabik, bhaajapa ke liye yah khatre kii ghanti he kyonki vah apni ek badi takat (shaleenta) se samjhauta kar rahi he jabaki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi, bhaajapa kii is takat ko apni shakti bana rahe hai or ise congress kii parampara se jodgaye kii koshish kar rahe hai
 In fact, the traditional voters of BJP have been counted as businessmen and businessmen, which is more pleasing to decency
 haalanki gujarat ke nateezon se andaja miltaa he ki is baar bhi kaarobaari varg ne bhaajapa kaa saath diya
 According to BJP sources, his votes were met because he did not have a choice
 unki naaraazgi kaa andaja isse miltaa he ki surat, rajkot, ahmedabad jaise shaharon main bhi is varg ne bhaajapa kii raily or sabhaaon kaa khulkar samarthan nahin kiya
 In many places there was even protest
 doosraa varg vah he jo 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke vyaktitv se prabhavit hokar saamne aayaa or bhaajapa ko pehali baar centre main purna bahumat kii sarkaar banane kaa avasar muhaiyaa karaayaa tha
 This class of supporters mainly includes youth, women, tribals and farmers
 party ke liye chintaa kii baat yah he ki na sirf yah varg vimukh ho rahaa he balki congress ke rup main isane kam se kam gujarat main to vikalp talash hi liya he
 The Sangh is not even worried about the BJP after the Gujarat election results
 darasal narendra modi ke pradhanmantri or amit shah ke bhaajapa adhyaksh banane ke baad bhaajapa ek ke baad ek rajya main jeet hasil karti gai
 Together with allies, BJP has power in 19 states
 aise main loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan bhaajapa or endie shasit rajyon main satta virdohi swaabhaavik rujhaan hoga
 Senior leaders of the party, including the Prime Minister, BJP President, will not have opportunities to accuse state governments of ignoring development
 unhen har haal main in rajyon kii sarkaar kii tarif kerani hi hogi
 So in states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Assam, Maharashtra, where the problems of farmers are not getting less, the youth are waiting for employment, the expected improvement in the condition of school and hospital No, in such a situation, the praise of these state governments can back fire
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah apane padaadhikariyon kii baithak main yah tathy rakhte aae hai ki jin rajyon main loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ne lagbhag sabhi siten jiti thim, unamem utani seat bachaa paanaa 2019 main sambhav nahin ho sakegaa
 For example, BJP holds 73 seats out of 80 in Uttar Pradesh, 26 seats in 26 of Gujarat, 25 out of 25 seats in Rajasthan, 10 out of 11 seats in Chhattisgarh
 bhaajapa ke aantarik survey main lagaataar yah baat aa rahi he ki in rajyon main maujuuda siton kii sankhya main 50 fisadi tak kami aa sakati he
 One of Prime Minister Modi's biggest concerns has always been that most BJP mps are not connected to the public
 modi baar-baar saansadon ke saamne is mudde ko uthaa rahe hai
 In the meeting of BJP Parliamentary Party even in the current session of Parliament, Modi asked the mps to devote more time in their constituency, work hard and remove the problem of the people
 abhi tak bhaajapa ke liye raahat yah thi ki congress majbootee se chunaav ladati nahin dikh rahi thi
 But Rahul Gandhi has succeeded in breaking this myth to a large extent in the Gujarat elections
 bhaajapa ke log bhi yah maan rahe hai ki gujarat main jis tarah ke nattejey aae hai, use dekhte hue rajasthan, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or karnataka main congress majbootee se ladgaye kaa maahaul banane main kaamyaab hui he
 If the Congress is able to show its strength in these states, then other opposition parties will have no problem in coming under the Congress umbrella
 vaise bhi rahul gandhi ne jignesh mewaani or alpesh thakor ke saath samjhauta bhale hi gujarat main kiya lekin ye donon netaa samaaj ke jis samudaay se aate hai, unamem rahul gandhi ek sandesh dene main kaaphi had tak safal bhi rahe hai

 The Aam Aadmi Party has approved the names of Sanjay Singh, ND Gupta and Sushil Gupta for the Rajya Sabha
 party ne jin teen naamon kaa elaan kiya he, un naamon ne sardi ke is mausam main bhi siyasat garm kar di
 Opposition parties ND Gupta and Sushil Gupta have been targeted by the Aam Aadmi Party when elected to the Rajya Sabha
 vahiin kabhi party main rahe or ab mukhyamantriaravind kejarivalsamet puri party kii karypranali par lagaataar sawaal uthaane vaale purv mantri or vidhayak kapil mishra ne ek baar phir nishaanaa saadhaa he
 According to Mishra, the names chosen by the party are neither common people nor agitators, nor are any party workers
 ye to bade-bade paise vaale log hai jinase arvind kejariwal kii deal hui he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has elected not a leader but a dealer to the Rajya Sabha
 ye pehali baar he ki inamen se koi dalit samaaj kaa vyakti nahin he, koi alpsankhyak samudaay kaa koi vyakti nahin he, koi kaaryakarta nahin he
 The seal on these names killed the movement of Ramlila Maidan in which a worker put his life to stand
 rajyasabha ke liye aam aadmi party ne jin naamon ko chunaa use kapil mishra ne ek badi galati qaraar dete hue kaha kii paison ke badale in logon ko tikat diya gaya jabaki party main kumaar vishwaas, swati maliwal, ashutosh, mira sanyaal jaise kai naam the
 Who worked among the workers on the ground
 samaaj kii behatari ke liye kaam kiya
 Kumar Vishwas and Swati Maliwal could not give crores of rupees, so deals were made with ND Gupta and Sushil Gupta
 rajghat par maunvrat main baithenge mishrarajyasabha nomination ke virodh main guuruuvaar subah 9 baje se kapil mishra rajghat par maunvrat rakhenge
 Mishra said that on the one hand, they will make nominations for the Rajya Sabha with big money
 duusari taraf andolan kaa ek kaaryakarta baapu kii samadhi par virodh darj karaayega, taaki taarikh gavaah rahe ki andolan kii hatya par har koi chup nahin baitha tha
 Kumar Vishwas, who was silent on corruption, was also discussing the name of Kumar Vishwas for Rajya Sabha, but now when Kumar Vishwas is out of the Rajya Sabha race, Kapil advised him
 kapil ne kaha kii hamen pataa tha kii kumaar bhai ke saath ye party aisa hi karegi
 Arvind Kejriwal is such a Duryodhana who also kills Karna
 mishra ne kumaar vishwaas se apil he kii sarkaar or party ke bhrashtachar ke jitne bhi raaj unhone apane andar rakhen hai, use janata ke saamne rakhen
 This will be justice with the people and the movement
 politics ke powergem main koun he number-1? desh kaa siyaasi mausam jaise-jaise chunavi hota ja rahaa he, ye bahes bhi jor pakadati ja hi he
 If someone says Narendra Modi is the juggler of this power game, then Rahul Gandhi can prove to be a trump card in someone's eyes
 magar is akalan kii jamini hakeekat kya he? ye jaanane kii koshish kii india today ne apane special survey ke jariye
 Now who will be the real player of the electoral game, it is late to be decided, but in the powerful figure of India Today, Rahul Gandhi has been overshadowed by Narendra Modi
 modi bijepi kii taraf se pradhanmantri ke ummidavaar ke taur par dekhe ja rahe hai, to rahul ke peeche congress kaaryakartaaon kii badi jamaat unhen bhi isi ohade par dekhnaa chaahati he
 This is the basic similarity in the 'namo vs Raga' contest, but there are some things that lead to Narendra Modi being overshadowed by Rahul
 rahul par baari modi kyon?narendra modi gujarat ko desh ke vikaas kaa model banane main kaamyaab rahe hai
 The powerful image in the party became such that even the opponents were unable to ignore it
 hindutv ke poster bvoy se pan indian image banane main safal rahe modi
 In the politics, the wind of Modi's name has become such that even if you hate Modi, you cannot ignore Modi
 lekin rahul gandhi ke saath mushkil ye he ki log unhen chaahate hai, to bhi wo netritv swikaarne se kataraate hai
 Yet Rahul Gandhi has managed to become one of the three axles of the country's politics
 ab rahul gandhi modi se bhale peeche rah gaye hon lekin power or popularity keelist main top par sonia gandhi hi virajman hai
 Despite the ill health, the way Sonia maintained a synergy between the party and the coalition government in times of crisis, used her power to fulfill political agendas and electoral promises, Sonia got the highest number for this
 politics main sabase powerful sonia kyon?sonia ne apane dam se 120 karod logon ke food security bill ko manjuur karaane main badi bhoomika nibhaai
 Ensured 25 per cent reservation for poor children in schools under Right to Education
 apane sadhe hue andaaj main sonia apane power kaa istemaal bakhubi karti hai
 But in tension or language, there is little talk
 sonia kaa gussa aakhri baar tab dikhaa tha, jab laalkrishna adwani ne sansad main upie ko avaidh kaha tha
 Sonia had protested against such disrespect
 shaktishaalee shakhsiyat kii sabase oonchi paaydaan par baithi sonia ne piem ko bhi peeche chhod diya
 Manmohan Singh is number four in this list
 politics ke shaktishaalee shakhsiyat kii list main chauthe number par pradhanmantri manmohan singh to paanchave number par unke sabase kaabil mantri finance ministar pi
 Chidambaram chhathen paaydaan par hai upie ko apane samarthan ke ishaare par nachaane vaale mulaayam singh yadav to saatven number par sonia ke bharosemand or sachiv ahamed patel

 Sujit Thakur, Warangal (telangana)
 gangadevipalli gaanv, warangal jila mukhyalay se mahaj 12 kilometre dur he
 Election campaign is at a peak in Telangana
 lekin pratyaashee jansampark karne ke liye is gaanv main nahin ja rahe hai
 Actually this village is already super smart
 bijli, pani, swatchta, buniyadi dhaanche kii yahaan koi samasya nahin
 In such a situation, when the candidates come here, the villagers ask them what they will do for this village first
 kya koi vijan yaa plan he jisase ye super smart gaanv ise upar ke darja paa sake
 But the candidates do not have the answer to this question
 gaanv ke log vot bechney ko taiyaar nahin to phir ab pratyaashee yahaan aakar karen bhi to kya?ab jab paisa dekar vot ke jugad kaa rasta hi band ho gaya he to phir yahaan jane kaa matlab pratyaashiyon ko samaj nahin aa rahaa he
 Let us introduce you to the specialty of this village
 1082 ki aabaadi vaale is gaanv main 947 voter hai
 Voting is also set to be 100 percent
 yah gaanv na sirf desh me balki videshon main bhi charchit he
 Nirmal Village is near the village of Tamga, super smart village
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 2017 kii farvari main apane man kii baat main isi gaanv kaa zikr kiya tha
 Former sarpanch of this village, Kusum Rajamalli, says that earlier the people of the village used to get drunk
 1982 main sharaab bandi hui
 Since then no one drinks alcohol in the village
 dhire-dhire or achhi pahal shuru kii gai
 Toilets were built in every house
 sadakon yaa galiyon main kooda phenkane par pabandi he
 500 if someone threw garbage
 kaa jurmaana he
 If a visitor to someone's house is found spitting on the streets, then the host is fined
 har ghar me bijli he
 For almost 10 years
 bijli hameshaa rahe iske liye saura urja kii vyavastha he
 Plants are installed for pure water
 ek ru
 Every household gets 20 liters of water
 isse zyada pani lenaa ho to 4 ru
 Mixed per liter
 shiksha 100 fisadi he
 From 1995 to 2006, all the officials including the sarpanch remained women in the management of the village
 france, srilanka or nepal se log yahaan aakar yah sikhte hai ki gaanv kaisaa hona chahie
 First, tell us the plan to take the village above the super! But why don't the candidates come to ask for votes in this unique village? Is it just because people have vowed not to sell votes? Kusum Rajamalli says that is not the only reason
 kasam lene se pehle kuch dalon ke log yahaan aae the
 But people started asking him what you would do for the village, so he had no answer
 pani, bijli, safai, skool sab he yahaan
 People ask if there is a vision to make this village more spectacular, then the candidates have no answer
 aise main jab vot nahin bechney kii kasam logon ne le lee to phir pratyaashiyon ke liye yahaan aane laayak kuch bachaa bhi nahin
 It will also be interesting to know that two children go on doing well, that ordinary farmer families live in this village
 guzaara kheti-baadi se hi chalata he
 8-10 people are also in government jobs, but not on any major position
 gaanv baale zyada padhe likhe bhi nahin hai, lekin 2 bacchon se adhik bachche nahin paidaa karne kaa niyam khud gaanv baalo ne bana rakhaa he
 What if there is a third child? Laughing, Kusum says, "if after the first child, there is a twin child the second time, God's will
" nahin to 2 se zyada bachche kaa vichaar gaanv main he hi nahin
 Just as there is only one temple in the village, there is no plan or demand for the village deity, any other temple, mosque or any other religion in the village

 aatanki thikaanon ko tabah karne ke liye pakistan kii seemaa main ghuskar kii gai airstrike se desh ke bheetar or baahar donon jagah ghamaasan machaa hua he
 Pakistan is not ready to accept that it has suffered some damage, so many voices are also rising within the country asking for evidence of destruction there
 lekin beete dinon main kuch baaten aisi nikal kar saamne ai hai, jo is baat kii gavaahi detii hai ki vayusena kii airstrike se aatank ke adde tabah to jarur hue hai
 1
 neshnal technical research orgenigeshan (NTRO) ke servilans se khulaasa hua ki jab balakot main bhartiya vayusena ne air strike kii, us samay vahaan par 280 se zyada mobile active the
 2
 vayusena ne airstrike ne bayaan diya ki hamen jo target mila tha, hamane use dhwast kiya he
 The mission of the Air Force has been 100 percent successful
 3
 The place where action was taken in Balakot was the madrasa of jaish-e-mohammed
 madrasa talim-ul-quran ke chaatr ne is baat kii pushti bhi kii thi ki unhone 26 farvari kii subah vahaan par dhamaake subah the, jiske baad pakistani sena ne unhen surakshit sthanon par pahunchaa diya tha
 4
 airstrike ke baad jab har koi saboot dhund rahaa tha tab kuch pakistani yugers ne twitor par likhaa tha ki 26 farvari ke baad unhone balakot main 10 ambulance bhi dekhe the
 5
 news agency royatres ne bhi daawa kiya tha ki kai sthaneey nivaasiyon ne is baat kii pushti kii thi us madrase main jaish kaa aatanki adda he or bhartiya vayusena ne unhen nishaanaa banaaya
 During this, he was also heard the sound of bomb blasts
 6
 Pakistani media has also claimed in many of its reports that the Indian Air Force took action in Balakot
 haalanki, unki media ne har baar ye hi bataaya ki vahaan adhik nuksaan nahin hua he
 7
 kuch media reports ne sthaneey nivaasiyon ke hawaale se bataaya tha ki bharat kii airstrike ke baad paas ke hi sainya aspataal or abtabad ke aspataalon main kai bed rigerv kar die gaye the
 However, none of the government parties refused to confirm this
 8
 The Pakistan Army had invited the world media to take them to Balakot just after the airstrike
 lekin ye bhi kaha tha ki vah turant nahin balki ek din baad le jaaenge
 Obviously, the army wanted to erase the evidence from there
 iske alaava jab media ko jane diya to madrase ke kshetra se kaaphi dur tak hi jane diya gaya
 9
 airstrike ke baad jaish-e-mohammad ke commander kaa ek audio saamne aayaa tha
 In which he confessed that his major base was destroyed in the attack of India
 haalanki jo is baat kii pushti karata he ki bharat ke hamale se aatanki sihar gaye hai
 10
 pakistan sanyukt raashtra main bharat ke khilaaf balakot main pedo ko nuksaan pahunchane ko lekar karrwai kar rahaa he
 Explain that Jaish's base was in the jungles, it is obvious that if there was an airstrike on the bases, then the trees there were also affected

 If you are thinking that the genie of fixing will be back in the bottle with Sreesanth, Chandila and Ankit Chavan, then you are thinking wrong
 khabar he ki kam se kam paanch or khilaadi aise hai jo ipel spot phixing main shaamil the
 Four of them are Indian players and three of them have played or are playing for Team India
 phixing ke sabase bade fans kii alag-alag jaanch kar rahi dilli or mumbai police ke sutron kii maane to in teen khilaadipoon or rajasthan royles ke alaava ipel kii teen auki tiimon ke kul paanch khilaadi phixing ke radar par hai
 Four of them are Indian players and one is a foreign player
 police sutro ke mutabik iff paanchon khilaadiyon ke naam desh bhar se pakade gaye bookiyon or giraftaar teenon khilaadiyon se poochtacha ke dauraan saamne aae hai
 In the initial investigation after questioning, the police are seen as suspicious of the role of these five players
 bakaul police in paanchon khilaadiyon kii bookiyon ke saath sambandh hone kii uske paas jaankaree hai, par police inke khilaaf koi bhi bade kadam uthaane se pehle pukhta saboot jutanaa chaahati he
 Therefore, call details of these five players and video footage of some special matches are under investigation
 police ko shaq he ki ipel ke dauraan ye bhi spot phixing main shaamil rahe hai
 According to the information received by Aaj Tak, out of these five players, four are Hindustani players, one is a fast bowler and three batsmen
 inamen se ek khilaadi ko chhod den to baaki teenon khilaadi alag-alag formet main team india ke liye khel chuke hai, jabaki chauthe ko bhavishya kii team india kii member mana ja rahaa he
 The fifth player is a foreigner and an all-rounder
 police sutron ke mutabik ipel ke dauraan ballebaajon ne bhi spot phixing kii thi
 The deal was to be dismissed at zero and by chance, the three batsmen whose names have been on the fixing radar have all been zeroed out once or more in this IPL session

 Excerpts: You are doing big films these days
 nai film chal chalem main kahaan ja rahe hai?aaj tak kisi ne koshish nahin kii aisi film banane kii
 Parents are putting a lot of pressure on children for studies
 is kahani ke jariye ham kahana chaahate hai ki buniyadi shiksha jarur den, lekin ek umr ke baad faisla lene kaa kaam bacchon par chhod den
 There is so much pressure that the children commit suicide when the results are not good in the examination
 chal chalem ke jariye aap dikhaanaa chaahate hai ki mata-pita bacchon ko khulaa chhod den
 If you do not provoke the children against the parents
 main isiilie film main kahata hum ki maa-baap par court main cese kar do
 i play the role of a lawyer in the film
 aap kah rahe hai ki maa-baap ke khilaaf cese kar do?ham haq kii ladaai ladate hai
 When the force reaches this point, i stand with them and fight
 is film se aap paashchaatya samskruti laa rahe hai
 In India, only children are respected by the parents, what will they do if they finish it? There is no relation of Western culture with it
 ham sirf yahi kahana chaahate hai ki yah ummid nahin karen ki har baccha first aayega
 This cannot be done
 koi second aayega, to koi third
 Sometimes a good boy can spoil that day and come second
 film main aapane bacchon se cese karavaaya or vahaan maa-baap ko sajaa dilwaai
 Not to punish, but to make parents realize that what they have thought they have done is wrong
 mithun chakravarti yahaan par samaaj-sudhaarak bane hai
 i will give it to producer Maheshji, writer Vijaya, who, despite not understanding Hindi, worked on such a sensitive subject
 parinaam nikle nahin ki saare newspaper aisi khabaron se bhar jate hai ki bachche ne aatmahatya kii
 When you got older in the film industry, maturity came on your face and became popular
 old ij gold kaise hota chalaa gaya?actor banane main thodaa samay lagata he
 i will blame the media that when people come, you push them up
 amit ji kii recovery 55-60 ke baad hui
 You were also absent from the screen in between
 har aadmi to number van ke mukaam par hameshaa nahin rahata
 One day you have to come down
 maine apane jivan main kaaphi bure din dekhe hai
 To secure the future of my children, i left acting and moved to the hotel line
 uti, mysore main mere resort hai
 i also have a school
 kuch samay tak amitabh bachchan or mithun da lagbhag baraabar rahe, lekin phir ve aage nikal gaye
 Amit ji is the biggest superstar ever in this country
 sachaai-sachaai he, ise koi badal nahin saktaa
 The film they can do, i can't do, what i can do, other people might not
 har vyakti kii category kaaphi saaf he
 After your film Disco Dancer, you slipped somewhere
 aapaki har film chalegi, isaki koi ganrti nahin he
 We expect every film to run
 aisa koi actor he jisaki film flop na hui ho? 10 ke baad ek or superhit ho jaati he
 This is how life goes
 aap kaaphi garibi se aae
 Worked hard to get out of it
 aap kuch krantikari the, naksalwad se bhi
 
 
 
 thodaa underground kaam to kiya hoga
 Looks at your eyes
 raajnneeti par main kuch nahin boluungaa
 As far as poverty is concerned, the city of Mumbai saw so much suffering that it scares thinking
 aap jab manmohan desai ke paas gaye the to unhone aapako 10 ru
 Gave a note of ve meri patni yogita se kaha karte the ki dekhnaa ki yah ladkaa ek din jarur aage jayega
 There is a lot of factionalism in Bollywood
 sori, main in sabase dur rahata hum
 i do not do all this
 bollywood bina gocip ke nahin chalata
 Maybe that's why i don't even go ahead and talk
 apane bete ko aapane laanch kiya lekin jitani safalataa chaahate the, nahin mili
 Whose lack for this? Own
 film industry main aap kise apana guru maanate hai?mrinal sen ko
 After your film Disco Dancer, Govinda came, Hrithik Roshan, Salman came, Prabhudeva
 
 
 aap kise sabase acha dancer maanate hai?hruthik roshan ko

 The BJP suffered a setback in the political battle of Maharashtra
 Who did the congress-ncp-shiv Sena find, whether the struggle for power for more than a month in Khoyamaharashtra reached its end on the day of Constitution Day i
e
 on Tuesday
 vidhansabha chunaav main sabase bade dal ke rup main ubhare bijepi ke netaa devendra fadanvis ko mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lene ke chauthe din hi istipha dena padaa
 Now the parties of number two, third and fourth are going to form a joint government even after the Shiv sena-ncp-congress being anti-ideological
 maharashtra kii nai sarkaar main mukhyamantri shivasena adhyaksh uddhav thakare honge, jo guuruuvaar kii shaam apane lavalashkar ke saath shivaji park main shapath lenge
 Under this, the formula for the sharing of power between the three parties has been decided
 aise main sawaal he ki ek maheene se chal rahi maharashtra kii siyaasi mahabharat main congress-ensipi-shivasena-bijepi main kisne kya paaya or kisne kya khoyaa?shivasena ne saathi khokar satta paimaharashtra ke siyaasi sangram main sabase bade phaayde main shivasena rahi he
 Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeraban is going to visit Maharashtra
 shivasena ko paanch saal ke liye siem pad dene par ensipi or congress ne sahmati de di he
 However, Shiv Sena has lost the support of its 30-year-old ally BJP
 isi ke saath shivasena ne centre sarkaar se apane cote kaa mantri pad bhi kho diya he
 With this, Shiv Sena has also damaged the image of its staunch Hindutva by going with the congress-ncp
 congress ko mila satta main hissacongress ne shivasena ke saath jaakar maharashtra kii satta main hissedari pai he
 In such a situation, he has got 13 ministerial posts including the deputy CM, but for this he has to compromise his secular ideology
 congress kaa shivasena ke saath jane kohindu virdohi chhavi se baahar nikalne kii kavayadke taur par bhi dekha ja rahaa he, iske liye congress 2014 ke baad se hi lagaataar koshish kar rahi thi
 However, the Congress has now become the number four party in Maharashtra
 ensipi tut se bachi to satta main bhaagedarimaharashtra ke asal kingmekar ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar banakar ubhare hai
 Even after the rebellion of Ajit Pawar, Sharad Pawar managed to keep the NCP from breaking
 maharashtra kii satta bhale hi shivasena ko mili ho, lekin iskaa sutaradhar pavaar ko mana ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, they will have remote control of power
 iske alaava ensipi satta main baraabar kii bhagidaar bhi he
 However, by giving Shiv Sena the post of CM, the NCP has given its opponent a chance to establish roots in Maharashtra by elevating itself
 kehane ko uddhav siem honge, lekin sarkaar kaa remote hameshaa pavaar ke haath main hoga
 He has also put an end to the challenge that daughter Supriya gets from Ajit inside the NCP
 saath hi unhone avishsaneey hone kaa iljaam bhi dho daalaa he
 The BJP has been the biggest loser in the political struggle of Maharashtra
 pradesh main sabase zyada 105 siten jeetne ke baad bhi satta se baahar he
 Not only this, the BJP has also lost its nda's oldest partner with the Shiv Sena
 itnaa hi nahin bijepi ne ajit pavaar ke saath haath milakar apni chhavi ko dhoomil kiya he
 In this way, the BJP neither got Maya nor Ram in Maharashtra

 The disappointment at the Rio Olympics in India, however, will take some time for professional boxing to gain popularity as people here are still fond of cricket and Olympic medals
 jab olympic padakon kii baat aati he to bhartiya mukkebaajon ne niraash kiya
 Only three Indian male boxers, Shiv Thapa, Manoj Kumar and Vikas Krishna were able to make it to the Rio Olympics, compared to seven male and one female boxers who had qualified for the 2012 London Games earlier

 Aziz said that since taking over the reins of the government last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is considering India as a regional power

 It is said that 75 words are required to write film songs nowadays and most of the lyricists work within so many words, so all the songs sound the same
 lekin sampurna singh kalra “gulzaar” in 75 shabdon ko chhodkar 76wein lafj se apni baat shuru karte hai
 The reason for this is that they are basically adi shayar
 adib or shaayar kii haisiyat se jahaan ve ehsasat or tajurbaat ko alfaaz main dhaalte hai, vahiin filmkaar kii haisiyat se unhen parde par bhi bakhubi utaarte hai
 Yatindra Mishra, editor of Gulzar's collection of poems Yar Julahe, says, "whenever we see someone in totality, Pryru assesses him by capturing him in his acclaimed and popular image
 ” lihaaja, unhone is kitaab main gulzaar kii najmon kii padtaal unki cinemai shakhsiyat se alag nahin balki uske humsafar ke taur par karne kii koshish kii he
 The poet, now popularly known as Gulzar from Gulzar Dinvi (dina, Pakistan, where he spent his childhood), faced the brunt of the partition, worked as a motor mechanic in Mumbai before moving to the film world and his friend-mentor Shailendra Connected to the well-known Tehreek
 “attharah agast unniis sau chauntis” kii “chasis” vaale gulzaar aaj bhi roj saat ghante likhte hai or apni umr ke logon kii tarah “hamaare jamaane main yah hua karata tha
 
 
 ”like do not throw jumlas, but instead keep time with ourselves
 yah digar baat he ki adibon main paaya jane vaala nostalgia unki rachanaaon main bhi he, lekin yah unke liye “vilasita he, manabahlav he
 You cannot live in such condition
 ” yahi vajah he ki ek ore unhone jahaan dina kii yaadon ko rachanaaon main taaja kiya he, vahiin apane jamaane kii lagbhag har hakeekat ko darj kiya, chaahe ve kitni hi talkh kyon na hon
 Yatindra, who has said Gulzar is "younger than me but is a friend," has studied his poetry in a small list of alphas that often come in his works: "roti, Tawa, Upale, Chulha, Smoke, Banyan Tree" , Moons, green leaves, betashe, silk tassels, mulberries, newspapers, birds, berries clouds, door of the house and water droplets - all together create the joy of Gulzar's poems and poetry
 ”inamen chand aisa lafj he jo baar-baar aata he, or aisa lagata he, maano yah unki shaayari kii pahchaan ban gaya he
 “chand Gulzar’s poem is the only image that meets us almost frequently
 vah akele main hi kabhi-kabhi puraa drishy banataa he yaa kisi najm main apane pravesh ke saath sari drushyavali ko vishisht kism kaa “gulzaar tip” bana detaa he
 "for example: sneak peeping donations or came alone / begging night with moon bowl
 brahmad kii amoort prakruti se aakarshith hone vaale gulzaar khud maanate hai, “main aksar chand ke bare main likhata hum, or yah kisi shaks yaa khaasiyat ko simbolies karata he
 NASA is their favorite website
 tajjub nahin ki unhone “pluto” se upgrah kaa rutaba chhinane par apni sari laghu kavitaayen uske naam kar deen
 From fifteen to seventy five it seems that Gulzar is not a slave of the Ravites
 amoort bhaavon ko alfaaz kaa jama pahanaakar khubasurat najm kii shakl dena gulzaar kii khaasiyat he
 They do not do gulo-bulbul's poetry, but the "silence" they introduced to the feeling of love, will probably always be remembered: love is no words, love is not a voice / there is a silence Extinguishes, does not stop, is not stagnant, is a drop of Nur / sheds for centuries
 amoort ko moort rup dene kii gulzaar kii maharath par aane vaali naslein rashk karengi or mumkin he hindi yaa urdu adab kaa koi chaatr unke is hunar ko apane shodhpatr kaa vishay banaae
 He will get a lot of help from his friend, as Yatindra has tried to make a "bunch" of Gulzar's representative acts in it
 inase gulzaar kii shakhsiyat or unki falsaphana soch ko samajhane main madad milti haih kya liye jate ho tum kandhon pe yaaro / is janaaje main to koi bhi nahin he
 
 
 / It is only soil, burying the soil / soil in the soil / Why do you cry? (murcia)
 gulzaar koi inklabi shaayar nahin hai lekin insaan kii bebasii or halaat par talkh tippanee dekhieh kabristaan he, kabristaan se gujaro to aahista bolo / 
 
 
 People are simply buried in the tombs of their bodies (tombs)
 ek or dekheh mujhako bhi tarkeeb sikhaa koi, yaar julahe!
 
 
 i had woven the same relationship once / but all its clutches / it is clear my friend! Likewise, "one manger", "what is death", "on the tree of the night", "if you mention, blessings come out of my lips", "the moon is smiling", "jindanamam"
 
 
 agar gulzaar chand nukte kii galatiyon or ek jagah labbolubaab kii jagah labboluab ko nazarandaaj kar den to yakeenan unhen bhi yah majamooa pasand aayega
 All the nuzzles and ghazals of this collection are a mirror of the personality and ficro-skill of the person, through which the world of Hindustani tongue is glorified

 Kashmir was an integral part of India first and will continue to be so
 inhone kaa maahaul bana diya he ki desh bhar main dhara 370 khatm hone ke baad khushhaali aa gai he
 Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot said that terrorism has been going on in Kashmir for 30 years, terrorists must have been caught in Kashmir, caught in Pakistan, captured in Afghanistan or caught by Iran but any part of India No Muslim has become a terrorist in Kashmir
 isliye bijepi ko dharm ke naam par raajnneeti band kar deni chahie
 Gehlot said, do not doubt the 200 million Muslims of India in this way
 yahaan kaa har vyakti deshbhakt he
 Today, there are no jobs in the country, there is an economic downturn and such things are done to draw attention from all these problems
 gahalot ne kaha ki mahatma gandhi or pandit nehru, patel jaise netaaon ne bharat main loktantr kii buniyaad rakhi he jisaki vajah se pradhanmantri narendra modi pradhanmantri bane hai
 Today, it is Modi's responsibility to protect democracy in the country

 bharat world cap se baahar ho chukaa he
 Crores of cricketers were heartbroken as they lost in the semi-finals to Australia
 phens kii niraashaa jaij bhi lagati he, kyonki puure toornament main itnaa shandaar pradarshan ke baad semifinal main aakar haarana dukh to detaa he
 But the good thing among these disappointments is that the World Cup 2015 will always be remembered for the strong performance of the bowlers
 world cap se pehle kisi ne sochaa nahin tha ki team india itnaa kamaal kaa pradarshan karegi
 India's biggest weakness emerged as the biggest strength in the World Cup
 world cap shuru hote hi bhartiya gendbaaj ek alag hi avatar main najar aae
 This data testifies that before the semi-finals, the bowlers of Team India bowled out their opponents in all the matches
 tej gendbaajon ke pradarshan main aayaa chamatkaarik badlaavajo gendbaaj puure samar australia main pitate najar aae, ve world cap main ek alag hi rang main najar aae
 During the Test and tri-series, bowlers who were completely deviated from the line and length suddenly created a sensation in the World Cup, returning to form
 achaanak hi short genden ballebaajon ke kaanon ke paas se siti bajaati hui guzarane lageen
 It is certain that if the bowlers had not done such a charismatic performance, then Team India would not have reached the semi-finals
 world cap main mohammad shami, umesh yadav or mohit sharma kii tikdi ne kamaal kaa pradarshan karte hue kul 48 wicket jatke, jisamen umesh yadav ne 18, mohammad shami 17 or mohit sharma ne 13 wicket hasil kiye

 Rawalpindi Express Shoaib Akhtar believes that Umesh Yadav has worked very hard in his bowling recently, which appeared in the World Cup
 aswin kii balkhaati gendon ke saamne bebas najar aae ballebazar aswin kii gumti gendon ne world cap main ballebaajon ko khub nachaaya
 The pair of Ashwin and Jadeja took a total of 22 wickets in this Mahakumbh, with 13 wickets in Ashwin and 9 wickets in the name of Jadeja
 khaas baat yah rahi ki aswin ne kanjusee baratate hue behad kifayati gendbaaji kii or ek-ek ran ke liye tarasaa diya
 Before the World Cup, Ashwin and Jadeja were also seen in quite a lot about their line, length and flight
 lekin test siries main flats gendbaaji karne vaale aswin ne world cap main gendon ko flite dena shuru kiya or ve ballebaajon ke liye sirdard ban gaye
 After this performance, it is worth recalling what former captain Kapil Dev said when batsmen are officials and bowlers in this game of cricket
 lekin bhartiya gendbaajon ne kam se kam is baar to yah sabit kar diya ki darasal adhikari ballebaaj nahin, gendbaaj hai

 In the video of com, Vipul said that the rising property rate in India can solve the Kashmir problem
 vipul ne kashmir ke aria ke hisaab se uskaa rate padosi mulk ke saamne rakhaa or kaha ki 'abhi aukaat he to kharid lo aap sar
 
 
 'seeing the solution of the Kashmir issue given by this standup comedian, you too will be looted
 dekhen puraa videoh It was not the first time that the children lost their lives
 
 
 ! haa, ek ke baad ek lagaataar gai
 So much that it became a sensation
 lekin aisa pehali baar to nahin hua
 
 
 ! Even before that many stigmas are on the nation, it is not new in a country like India and it should not be a surprise
 dosha keval sarkaar par, doctoron par or aspataal par thope dena bhi apane par uthe sawaalon se bachanaa hoga, vyavastha par sawaal to utane gambhir hai hi, lekin unhen uthaane se pehle jaraa ek baar khud se puuchhiega
 When you talk about making a country, where are the children in it, how much space is there for them, how many policy-rules and priorities are there for them, do you vote to make the world of children better
 
 
 ? isliye aashcharya mat kijiega
 If we change the number of child mortality in India to numbers, we see our weaknesses clearly
 bahut puraani baat nahin, bharat main 2008 se 2015 ke bich ke aath saalon main 1
 113 crore children could not celebrate their fifth birthday
 yah samaaj unhen bachaa nahin paaya
 About 62 of these
 40 lakh bachche janm ke pehle maheene (28 din ke bheetar) hi maut kaa shikaar ho gaye
 That is, 56 percent of the children died in their neonatal period
 ab is desh main bullate ten aa bhi jaae, to kya
 
 
 What if Hindustan becomes digital? 
 
 ! yah jo bihar main ek ke baad bachche mar rahe hai, is kalank ko lekar ham vaise bhi duniya ko kya munh dikhaa sakate hai
 There is never any serious discussion on the death of children, nor is it reported seriously and consistently
 ab bhi ICU se jo report karte varisht patrkaar aapako dikhaai denge, ve yaa to doctoron kii kami ko iskaa jimmedaar maanenge yaa phir dawa nahin hone ko doshi maan liya jayega
 Where can our media show more capacity and power on health reporting, while the World Health Organization website states that 4 of the total GDP in India
 7 pratishat hissaa swasthya par kharch kiya jaataa he
 This is only 0 in the last 20 years
 7 pratishat hi bad paaya
 It is still half of the world's average GDP percentage in the health sector
 yah aankada bhi do saal pehle tak kaa he
 Out of this, a large part of the allocated amount remains without spending
 chikitsa shiksha kaa haal bura he
 Doctors are not being produced in the country in proportion to the sick
 sasti or saarvajanik swasthya sevaaon ko ventilator par le jaaya ja rahaa he, or ab chikitsa beemaa ke baad to inaki haalat or bhi kharaab hone vaali he, kyonki sarkaar achche ilaaj ke liye bime kii rakam de bhi rahi he or hamaare samaaj ne bhi ab yah maan liya he ki acha ilaaj to nijee aspataalon main hi miltaa he
 At the World Health Conference held in 1977 in Alma Dough, Soviet Russia, it was decided that the main social goal of governments and the World Health Organization (WHO) should be that such a level of health should be available to all the people of the world by 2000 , So that social and economic producers can lead a life
 'aalma aataa' ghoshnaa main, 'san 2000 tak sabhi ke liye swasthya' kii baat kahi gai, lekin tab tak yah lakshya puraa nahin ho paaya
 After this, the Centenary Development Goal - under which there was talk of providing health to all by 2015
 parantu abhi bharat jaisi vishwa kii sabase teji se badhati arthvyavastha bhi apane teen chauthai se zyada nagarikon ko swasthya sevaayen uplabdh karwaane main asamarth rahi he
 The Sustainable Development Goals have also talked about better health, but there is no roadmap to reach its goals
 swasthya kaa masalaa poshan se judaa he
 If health is to be corrected in India, nutrition will have to be improved
 poshan kai kaarnon se bigadaa he, un samaajon main bhi, jo aarthik abhaav main nahin hai
 An economic scarcity society is living on the brunt of malnutrition and India's National Family Health Survey states that nearly 36 percent of children in India are still underweight according to their age, a type of malnutrition
 in bacchon ke biimaar hone kii dasha main unki maut hone kaa kahin zyada khatra he, lekin jis tarah kuposhan ko khatm karne kii gati hamaare desh main he, us gati se bacchon kii mauton ko roka janaa bahut baad main sambhav ho sakegaa
 Therefore, if children are to be saved, they do not have to be seen as being limited only to the availability of doctors and medicines
 uske liye ek vyapak or lagaataar vimarsh kii jarurat he
 a public discussion and public opinion is needed

 During Ramadan, everyone is expressing his opinion about voting

 party ko ashanka he ki bayaanbaji ke liye mashhoor uske netaa apane badbolepan yaa ooljulul bayanon se party ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 a list of these leaders has been prepared, which has become notorious in the party for this
 bhaajapa ke ek bade netaa se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, party adhyaksh amit shah is baat ko lekar kaaphi chaunkanne hai ki party ke kisi netaa kii ore se galatabayani yaa phir koi anargal baat na kahi jaae
 He asked all the state presidents and organization ministers to ensure that only the person authorized by the party should make a statement on any issue
 sutron kaa kahana he ki kai baar is tarah kii bayaanbaji kii vajah se puraa chunavi paridrishy hi badal jaataa he
 The party goes ahead with the election with a well thought out strategy and issues
 aise main muddon yaa ranneeti se hatakar bayaanbaji se party ko nuksaan ho saktaa he
 For this, the example of the last Lok Sabha election is also being given on the party forum, how a BJP leader who is also a minister in the central government lost the BJP by a simple margin because of his statement
 sutron kaa kahana he ki mahila utpeedan, dalit, alpsankhyak or mandir jaise mudde par sanjidagi dikhaane kii naseehat party kaaryakartaaon ko di gai he
 It is also advisable not to use indecent words and gestures against the leaders of the opposition party
 gauratlab he ki chunavi sargarmi main aksar party netaa aise bayaan dete rahete hai, jo media main chaa jate hai or jin par bharpoor vivaad bhi hota he
 Such leaders are in every party
 gujarat chunaav main hi congress netaa manishankar ayyar kii piem modi ko neech bataane vaala bayaan bhala kaise koi bhul saktaa he
 The BJP does not want its own leaders to become victims of this disease of the opposition parties and the opponents take advantage of them

 The sports tribunal on July 27, 2015, during the hearing of the case between Duti and the Athletics Federation of India and the International Athletics Association (IAAF), suspended the Hyperendrogenism Rules of the Global Society for two years, taking an interim decision
 aisa isliye kiya gaya tha ki ieeef ko atirikt sakshya muhaiyaa karaane kaa mauka milegaa ki hyperandrogenic mahila khilaadi ko saamaanya testosterone (purush hormone kaa str) str kii khilaadi par pradarshan ke aadhaar par kitna phayda miltaa he
 Cass partially accepted Duti's appeal in an interim order two years ago and was given a contest exemption until a final verdict
 ieeef ne ek baar phir maamle ko aage badhaane kaa faisla kiya he or vaishvik sanstha kii hyperandrogenism niti ke khilaaf duti kii apil phir surkhiyon main aa gai he
 Many human rights activists in India and abroad have termed it a case of 'gender discrimination'

 The IAAF said in a press release today that its financial aid study report on the suspended hyperandrogenism rules has been published and is returning to CAS before the two-year deadline that ends on 27 July

 ) Actress Rani Mukherji has played the lead role in the film 'mardaani' and is accompanied by Bengali actors Jishu Sen Gupta, Taheer Bhasin and Priyanka Sharma
 'mardaani' kaa nirdesan kiya he, pradeep sarkaar ne
 The story of the film is very simple, where Shivani is an inspector in Shivaji Rao ie Rani Mukerji Crime Branch and she is close to Pyari, a girl living in a child's ashram, but suddenly one day the cutie disappears and Shivani Looks for the baby girl
 kya hua pyaari ke saath, uske gaayab hone ke peeche kiskaa haath he, in sab sawaalon ke jawaab shivani dhundti hai
 If you want to know the answers to these questions, then you will have to watch the film
 ab baat film kii khaamiyon or khoobiyon kii
 The story of the film is straightforward, where you will not get to see much twist-turns, however, because of this, the audience can anticipate what is going to happen next
 nateeja darshak film main apni ruchi kho sakate hai
 Like the story, the screenplay of the film is straightforward
 main kisi bhi kirdaar ke saath yaa kahani ke saath jud nahin paaya
 i also liked the direction of Pradeep Sarkar
 mujhe lagata he ki rani ke star power ko pradeep sarkaar thik se istemaal nahin kar paae
 Rani's character is also similar to the story and screenplay, which failed to leave its mark on the audience
 ab baat khoobiyon kii, pradeep sarkaar ne 'mardaani' ko vaastaviktaa ke kareeb rakhane kii koshish kii he
 The film does not have songs, if it were, then the pace of the film would have weakened
 film main sirf ek gaanaa he, jise mardaani antham kaha gaya he or iskaa istemaal film kii gati par brake nahin lagaataa
 To some extent, the film's villain Tahir Bhasin makes his presence felt on the screen
 sabase ahm baat film main khaas sandesh he
 2 to 'mardaani' from my side
 5 stars

 Anil Ambani's company Reliance Defense, which was involved in a political dispute over the Rafale fighter jet deal, on Sunday clarified that it has not received any fighter aircraft contract from the Ministry of Defense
 company ne kaha ki is mudde par logon ko gumraah karne ke liye jaanboojhkar niraadhaar or galat aarope lagaaye ja rahe hai
 Answering various questions, the group said that French company Dassault has to supply 36 Rafale fighter aircraft to the Indian government

 Has chosen to be its partner
 videshi company dwaara bharat main bhagidaar ke chayan main raksha mantralay kii koi bhoomika nahin he
 Rajesh Dhingra, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Reliance Defense, said that under the agreement at the level of the governments of the two countries, 36 aircraft fully equipped for flight are to be directly supplied to India
 iskaa matlab he ki unka niryaat france se desalt company dwaara kiya janaa he
 HAL or any other production agency will have no role in this as no aircraft will be manufactured in India
 bharat chaar ‘rafel mantri’ dekh chukaa, magar ab tak sirf piem modi hi jaanate hai france main kya hua tha: rahul He said that HAL was made the designated agency for the 126 'medium Multi Role Combat Aircraft' (MMRCA) program

 This is the situation since 2005 when an 'offset' policy was introduced in the country
 unhone kaha ki ab tak desh main 50 se adhik ofaset (niryaat daayitv) anubandh par dastakhat kiye gayi, sabhi main vahi prakriya apanaayi gayi
 "therefore, in order to mislead people, these kinds of things are being done deliberately
" ’’ According to the country's offset policy, when a major defense deal is made with any country, a condition is laid in it that a certain percentage of the total imports will have to be prepared in India, for which investment will be made in India or for components, essential goods
 Shopping must be done in India
 reliance dephence kaa ladaaku vimaan banane ke kshetra main koi anubhav nahin hone ke bare main dhingada ne kaha ki ki echeel ko chhodkar kisi bhi company ke paas ladaaku vimaan banane kaa anubhav nahin he
 He said, "this means that the capacity that we have will only remain there and we cannot create any new capacity
" iskaa parinaam yah hoga ki desh raksha hardware ke liye 70 pratishat se adhik aayaat par nirbhar bana rahegaa
 Dhingra denied the allegations completely that Reliance would benefit from the Rs 30,000 crore contract

 Dassault will have a 49 percent stake in the venture
 dasalt ke paas airospes vinirmaan ke kshetra main 90 varsh kaa lanbaa anubhav he
