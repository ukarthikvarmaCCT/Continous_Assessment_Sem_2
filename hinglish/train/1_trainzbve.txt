 desh kaa dil kahe jane vaale madhya pradesh kii rajdhani bhopal loksabhaa seat ke chunavi jang par deshbhar kii nigahen lagi hui hai
 From here, Congress veteran and 10 years Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Digvijay Singh is in the field, against whom BJP has made the contest interesting by taking down Sadhvi Pragya Thakur, accused of terrorism case
 digvijay ke khilaaf bijepi kaa kila bachaane kii jimmedaari purv siem shivaraj singh chouhan ne apane haathon main le lee he
 In this way, the political battle of Bhopal is confined between Digvijay vs Shivraj
 bhopal se chunavi ran main utari sadhvi pragna thakur shuruaati daur main aise bayaan die, jisase bijepi baikfoot par najar aane lagi thi
 Pragya Thakur's statement about the martyr Hemant Karkare in the Mumbai attack, the party was very angry
 party ne unki raay ko nijee bataakar pallaa jhaada lekin nuksaan jo hona tha, vah ho chukaa tha
 This is the reason that Shivraj Singh Chauhan, who was Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh for 13 years, had to come forward and take command of the political battle of Bhopal in order to overcome the electoral waters of Pragya Thakur
 vahiin, digvijay singh ke paksh main abhi tak congress ke sheersh netritv kii ore se koi raily yaa road sho nahin kiya he
 Not only this, no big leader from Delhi has even been seen in the promotion of Digvijay
 bataa den ki bhopal seat par digvijay ke mukaable chunaav prachaar main peeche chal rahi sadhvi pragna thakur ke liye shivaraj ne ab puri takat jhonkkar maahaul banane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan is continuously holding meetings and road shows in all the eight assembly seats under Bhopal parliamentary seat
 shivaraj apni sabhaaon ke jariye sidhaa digvijay singh ko target par lete hue unhen bantaadhaar bataa rahe hai
 He is saying what was the condition of Madhya Pradesh 15 years ago
 congress sarkaar ke 4 maheene ke kaarykaal se lagane laga he ki pradesh main 15 saal pehle kaa yug waapas aa gaya he
 If you look at the political battle of Bhopal parliamentary seat, BJP wants to win political battle through Hindutva and nationalism
 jabaki, bijepi ke hard hindutv ke jawaab main congress soft hindutv kaa card khel rahi he
 In favor of Digvijay Singh, his Guru Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati is camping in Bhopal and creating an atmosphere
 iske alaava computer baba sadhu-santon ke saath bhopal kii galiyon main gum-ghumkar vot maang rahe hai
 Mahamandaleshwar Swami Vairagyanand has also come out in support of Digvijay Singh
 virodhiyon par khamoshi akhriyaar kiye digvijay pragna thakur par kisi tarah kii koi tippanee nahin kar rahe hai
 On the streets of Bhopal, Digvijay is constantly changing his election strategy and is now doing door-to-door election campaigning on foot
 digvijay or unke samarthak lagaataar har mohalle main pahunchane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Whereas from Shivraj Singh Chauhan to Sadhvi Pragya Singh are constantly taking on Digvijay Singh

 The short film 'vigil Bastard' is based on this concept
 ‘visil bastard’ bakait antertenment ke binar tale banaaya gaya he
 Earlier last year, this production house film 'A Devil's Conspiracy' came out which got mixed response

 The lead characters of the film are seen in Junaitjit Mukherjee, Amita Noval and Rohit Upadhyay

 The ruling BSP in Uttar Pradesh has not yet decided to participate in the bandh
 basapa nahin chaahati he ki vah apane mukhya pratidwandvi dal sapa ke saath khadi dikhe, jo bharat band main vam morche kaa saath de rahi he
 Major opposition parties in Bihar, RJD and LJP, are keeping a distance from the bandh due to such compulsions
 vahaan sattarudh rajg main shaamil bhaajapa or jad band ke saath hai
 LJP leader Ram Vilas Paswan said, "we are not involved in the bandh
" ham bhaajapa ke saath nahin ja sakate hai
 We have already called for a bandh against inflation on 10 July
 ’’ unhone saaf kaha, ham bihar main bhaajapa or jadyu ke saath kaise ja sakate hai
 There is no such compulsion with the Left Front in Bihar, so it is with the bandh
 haal hi main rajyasabha chunaav main congress kaa samarthan karne vaali ralod ne abhi apane pattey nahin khole hai
 It is believed that she is going to align with the Congress in the upcoming elections to the Uttar Pradesh Assembly
 2014 ke aam chunaav main ganga chunaav prachaar kaa centre ban gai thi
 When the BJP formed a government with a strong majority under the leadership of Narendra Modi, the priority of the government also showed Ganga
 ab jabaki modi sarkaar kaa kaarykaal khatm ho rahaa he or nai sarkaar ke chayan ke liye chunaav prachaar jari he tab bhi ganga siyasat kaa hot topic bani hui he
 This time along with the BJP, it has entered the Congress to cash in on the Ganges
 shuruyaat party kii navaniyukt mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ne apni boat yatra se kii he
 Priyanka's Vote Yatra started from today will not only strengthen the party's message of soft Hindutva, but through this, the Congress is trying to bring the hollowness of the promises of the Modi government and the reality of development to the public
 uttar pradesh main ganga nadi kii lambaai 1140 kimi he
 Right now, politics is floating on its waves
 congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi boat se kareeb 140 kimi yatra par nikali hai
 So that they can know the situation of Ganga and can campaign for Congress with the help of Ganga
 priyanka ke pita or purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ne ganga kii safai ke liye banaras se hi ganga ection plan shuru kiya tha
 Here, Prime Minister Narendra Modi became MP in 2014 from Varanasi itself
 phir unki sarkaar ne bhi namaami gange project launch kiya
 So that the Ganges remains clean
 uttar pradesh main kul 80 loksabhaa siten hai
 About half of these seats are affected by the Ganges
 bijanour se nikali ganga baliya tak kareeb 26 siton par dharmik or aarthik taur par sidhaa asar daalati hai
 Of these, the opposition has five seats
 baaki sari siton par bhaajapa kaa kabja he
 Priyanka's visit to the Ganges will affect religiously, politically, economically and socially
 khaas baat yah he ki desh main duusari baar nadi kaa sahaara lekar boat ke jariye prachaar ho rahaa he
 Earlier Narendra Modi campaigned with a boat in Sabarmati during the Gujarat assembly elections in 2017
 dharmik asar : log jod lete hai khud ko ganga seganga hinduon ke liye aadhyatm or aasthaa kaa strot he
 Priyanka is promoting herself as Ganga's daughter
 unhone is yatra kii shuruyaat prayag main hanuman mandir kaa darshan karke kii
 Then worshiped Ganga, then set out on a boat
 paryaavarniya asar : ganga kii safai par uthaa sakati hai sawalpriyanka ganga safai ko lekar modi kii centre or upi kii yogi sarkaar se sawaal kar sakati hai
 He also has a reason for this, because the BJP made big promises to clean the Ganges
 namaami gange project ke naam par kharch kiye gaye karodon rupayon kaa hawala dekar logon ko ganga kii gandagi dikhaa sakati hai
 Political impact: Ganga tour will be affected in 11 seats Priyanka Gandhi's tour will have a direct impact on Prayagraj, Bhadohi, Mirzapur and Varanasi seats
 iske alaava apratyaksh rup se kaushambi, phulpur, machhlishahar, jonpur, sonbhadra, chandauli or gajipur ke logon ko saadhane kaa kaam priyanka yahaan se karengi
 The Congress General Secretary of Eastern UP will know how much benefit it will get after the election
 saamaajik asar : mallahon ke jariye 8% voter khinchne kaa prayaas karengi priyankavaranasi main priyanka mallahon se baatcheet karengi
 The seafarer population in UP is 08 per cent
 inamen nishad, mallaah, kevat, kashyap, maanjhi, bind, dhimaar jaisi kai upjatiyaan hai
 The influence of this community is around 20 seats
 ye haar-jeet main ahm bhoomika nibhaati hai
 On Priyanka's target, the seat campaign from Rajnath to Modi started from Lucknow
 vah bhi road sho karke
 Rajnath Singh came to his target here
 phir, prayagraj ke phulpur seat par bhi asar padegaa
 Jawaharlal Nehru and his sister Vijay Laxmi Pandit won from here
 aakhri din priyanka ke target par rahegaa banaras
 Which is Modi's stronghold

 ) In 2019, many sectors of the business-industry were in poor condition, due to the slowdown in the economy, five sectors especially gasping, it has a very bad effect on sectors like real estate, auto, telecom, consumption of essential commodities like biscuits, soap, shampoo also reduced
 Due to slowdown in the economy, the condition of most of the business-industry sectors in the country remained poor in 2019
 car-makaan kii bikri kii to baat hi chhod dijie, biscuit, sabun , shampoo jaise jaruri chizon kii bikri main bhi giravat dekhi gai
 However, five sectors, especially from auto to real estate, were seen gasping
 aaie in par vistaar se najar daalate hai
 1
 lagaataar feeki he makaanon kii chamakarial estate sector vaise to pichley kai saal se mushkil se guzar rahaa he, lekin is saal bhi yah sankat se baahar nahin ho paaya he
 The situation got worse with ruined or troubled developers, stranded projects and no interest in consumers buying houses
 badi sankhya main flats, makaan taiyaar khadey hai jinke kharidaar nahin mil rahe
 The government has also taken several measures to give relief to the real estate sector
 kai diwalia ho chuke builder ke adhure project supreme court ke aadesh or nigaraanee main puraa karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Most states have enacted the RERA law, raising the expectation of timely delivery of flats
 iske alaava sarkaar ne is saal real estate ko kai tohfe die hai
 Economic sluggishness is also the main reason for not real estate sales, people do not have much income nor have any assurance about the future, so people are not able to decide to buy a house
 iske alaava jaankaar yah bhi kehete hai ki yah sector abhi tak notebandi ke jatke se ubar nahin paaya he
 According to Enrack Property Consultant, in 2014, 3,50,000 houses were sold in the country, which decreased to 2,10,000 in 2017 after demonetisation
 kendriya mantrimandal ne november maheene main is sector ke liye 25,000 karod rupee ke package ko manjuuri di, taaki fanse hue project kii madad kii ja sake
 However, the fund to be formed for this will take time and the effect will be visible only in the next year i
e
 2020
 gauratlab he ki bhartiya real estate kaarobaar kareeb 8

 Auto sector is not able to catch pace This year, the most talked about auto sector was losing momentum
 puure saal lagbhag sabhi auto companiyon kii bikri main giravat kaa daur dekha gaya
 In October, in the festive season, there was a slight increase in the sales of some companies in October, but after that the situation became the same again
 yahaan tak ki bikri ke lagaataar nae ricard banane vaali sabase badi company maaruti sujuki ko bhi bikri main giravat kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 The slowdown in the economy is the main reason for the decline in sales of the auto sector
 logon ke paas jab atirikt paisa hi nahin batch rahaa to car kahaan se kharidenge, sirf jaruri chizon kii kharid kii ja rahi he
 In addition, adherence to the BS6 standard and the increasing trend of electric vehicles are also affecting vehicle sales
 gramin arthvyavastha kii sthiti acchhee na hone se tractor kii bikri bhi prabhavit ho rahi he
 All these have resulted in thousands of layoffs in the auto sector and many plants have to be closed
 haalanki auto sector kii mandi main kuch raahat ke bindu bhi rahe, jaise emji motors ke esayuvi emji hectares kii kharidari ko amir log tut pade
 The company delivered more than 700 vehicles on the day of Dhanteras
 company ne kul 28,000 kaaron kii booking hasil kii
 Similarly, 60,000 bookings were received for the Celtos SUV of Kia Motors

 The telecom sector is not getting the profit
 After the network, the most troubled and discussed sector in the year after Auto was Telecom
 reliance jeeyo ke aane baad shuru hui price waar se zyaadaatar telikam companiyaan halkaan to thi hin, ki is bich edjasted grass revenue yani agiaar kaa bakaayaa hissaa sarkaar ko dene ke supreme court ke unke khilaaf aane vaale nirnay ne unki qamar hi tod di
 With this order, about 1 on telecom companies
 3 lakh karod rupee kaa boj padane vaala he
 Its biggest hit is on Airtel and Vodafone, who will have to pay Rs 43,000 crore and Rs 40,000 crore respectively
 isaki vajah se sabhi telikam companiyon ne saal ke ant main tarriff main 35 se 40 fisadi kii baari badhotaree kar graahakon ko jhatka diya he
 However, while trying to give some relief to the telecom sector, the government has allowed the payment of spectrum dues with some delay
 31 march, 2019 tak ke aankadon ke mutabik telikam sector par kareeb 5 lakh karod rupee kaa karj tha
 In the quarter ended September, Vodafone Idea incurred the biggest loss of Rs 50,921 crore in the Indian corporate sector
 airtel ne bhi 23,045 karod rupee ke ghate kaa elaan kiya he
 Another major event in the telecom sector this year was the announcement of merger of BSNL and MTNL and plans to protect them
 ghate main chal rahi sarkari companiyon beasenel or emtnael ko lekar modi sarkaar ne oktober main bada faisla kiya or donon ke vilay kii yojana ko manjuuri de di gai he
 It was earlier discussed that the government is planning to shut down these government telecom companies
 beasenel ke hajaaron karmchaariyon ke liye aakarshak viares yojana pesh kii gai or 77 hajaar se zyada karmchaariyon ne ise sweekaar bhi kar liya he

 biscuit se lekar toothpaste tak kii khapat main kameeis baar kii aarthik susti main sabase chintajanak baat rahi fast mowing kanjumar guds yani emmemasiji sector kii bikri kii raftaar kaa post ho janaa
 Sales of things like biscuits to toothpaste, hair oil, soap, shampoo have started declining
 khaskar biscuit kii bikri paravaan na chadh paanaa chintajanak he jise garibon kaa naashtaa kaha jaataa he
 Due to this, there were also reports of layoffs in many companies like Parle
 haalanki jaankaar yah bhi kehete rahe ki halaat utane bure nahin hai or jiesti kii vajah se is sectorco thodaa jhatka laga he
 Almost all companies like Hindustan Unilever, Patanjali, Dabur, Britannia have been affected due to poor agricultural production, especially rural sales
 5
 The impact of sluggishness on consumer durables also, when people are avoiding eating even biscuits, how could the consumer durables sector remain unaffected by sluggishness
 is saal tivi se lekar, washing mashin or anya white guds kii bikri main giravat dekhi gai
 The sector also has a significant impact on GST
 isaki vajah se sarkaar ne elidi panel par aayaat shulk ko khatm kar raahat dene kii kuch koshish kii
 In fact, LED panels account for 60 to 70 percent of the TV cost
 real estate sector main pareshaani kii vajah se cabel, switch gear, jaise electrical utpaadon kii bhi bikri bhi paravaan nahin chadh paa rahi

 Due to changing trends of the people, the culture of the heritage buildings is also flourishing here

 Patel says, "I saw a lot of houses
" shahar se 12 kilometre dur ek plot bhi kharida
 But the family wanted the house to be in the city
 isliye narmada road sthit krishna hits main ek teen kamaron kaa flats book kara diya
 "he explains the reason for his decision," i did not buy the duplex because the family can live together in it, but it only happens to live in the flat, there is also a feeling of security
 ”solah lakh kii aabaadi vaale is shahar main dhire-dhire flats culture viksit ho rahaa he
 In the last seven-eight years, there has been a significant increase in the number of multi-storey buildings here
 chunki shahar kaa ek bada hissaa dephence or chhavnee main aata he isliye aabaadi kaa adhik dabaav mukhya shahar main he
 Currently, most residential buildings are four to five storeys high
 madhya pradesh bhoomi vikaas niyam 1984 ke tahat imaaraton kii adhiktam oonchai 53 meter nirdhaarit thi
 The Land Development Rules 2012 came into existence last year, under which the height of highrise buildings has been increased to 90 meters
 nayaa niyam aane ke baad ab bilders badi sankhya main nae projects lekar aa rahe hai
 Currently, the tallest residential building in the city is Krishna Heights, a joint project of Samadia Builders and Sethi Constructions
 narmada road par bane is project main 21 meter oonchai kii paanch imaaraten bani hai
 Each building has seven floors in addition to the ground floor
 ground floor puri tarah parking ke liye arakshit he
 The most important thing about this project is that no flat wall is connected to another flat
 krishna hits kii chaaron imaaraton ke bich main ek khubasurat terres garden banaaya gaya he
 Apart from this, facilities of swimming pool, community building, gym etc
 are also available
 samadadia bilders ke propreter ajit samadadia kehete hai, ''krishna hits main flats book karwaane vaale zyaadaatar log bijness or sarvice class se hai
 "they give the reason for the promotion of flats," The cost of electricity and water in flats is less than 30 percent as compared to private houses
 iske alaava rakh-rakhaav kaa kharch or jimmedaari bhi kam ho jaati he
 “most of the builder's projects are outside the city due to lack of land in the middle city and the cost of available land being wildly expensive
 jaisaa ki samadadia kehete hai, ''shahar ke bich ab jameen milti nahin he, isliye nae project shahar ke baahar hi aa rahe hai
 Our biggest project ever, Muskan Gold will be completed soon

 All the entertainment facilities are available in this mall 30 meters high
 isamen shopping jone ke alaava theatre, hotel, pub, banquet haul, dukaane, manoranjan jone or food jone bhi hai
 There are some advantages to buying flats in big buildings and some disadvantages
 logon kaa maananaa he ki mahangaai badaae ke kaaran rakh-rakhaav bahut mahangaa ho gaya he
 Maintenance in flats costs less
 sabase bada phayda suraksha kaa he
 But the area in the flat is fixed and cannot be increased as per the requirement whereas in independent houses there is scope to increase the rooms or floors according to the requirement

 " basapa supremeo mayawati ne party se barkhaast netaa nasimuddin siddiki par palatwaar karte hue unhen blackmailer qaraar diya he
 He said that what happens to someone who tapes the talk of the leader of his party
 unhone kaha ki nasimuddin kisi kaa hitaishi nahin ho saktaa
 Party leaders from western UP, Lucknow division and Uttarakhand also complained to me against Nasimuddin
 party netaaon ne kaha ki aap ne jinako upar baithaaya he, unhen nahin hataaengi, to party aage badhane ke bajaay peeche chali jaaegi
 Maya said that Nasimuddin is a very big blackmailer
 party netaaon ke phone tepe karata he
 He continues to lead his people and favors loyal party workers
 saath hi dhamkee dete hai ki agar kaam nahin kiya, to tepe bahanji ko bhej duungaa
 He said that while playing his responsibility, i also realized that senior members of the party along with evms also did not play their role properly
 nasimuddin par mayawati ke palatwaar kii badi baaten-- party virdohi gatividhiyon ke chalate nasimuddin ko party se baahar kiya
 People from western UP, Lucknow division complained against Naseem
 unhone kaha ki hamen nasimuddin siddiki nahin chahie
 - Like other parties, Bahujan Samaj Party does not take money from big capitalists
 balki sadsyta shulk se party or sanghathan chalaati hai
 - The tapes narrated by Nasimuddin are not complete
 uske saath chhedchhad hui he
 - i always tell people from the party that every month, a little money should be deposited for the party
 - membership kaa paisa aadha jamaa hua tha, aadha paisa nasimuddin kha gaye
 These people should eat the money of the poor and the poor
 
 i will not let this happen
 - nasimuddin ne duusare muslim netaaon ko party main aage nahin badhane diya
 He would have been expelled from the party by making false allegations against many people
 party kaaryakartaaon se inkaa vyavhaar bahut kharaab hota
 That is why he was removed from UP and planted in Madhya Pradesh
 9 taarikh ko nasimuddin ko paisa lekar aana tha
 Made the call several times, but they did not come
 
 
 kyonki daal main kaala tha
 - Those who are with Nasim have their money invested in Nasimuddin's business
 - muslim samaaj ke log naseem ko kabhi maaf nahin karenge
 They should have thought about what they are talking about their society
 naseem ko nikaalane ke baad muslim netaaon ke phone aae or bole ki bahut acha hua
 People of Muslim society said that Nasim was a jammer in the BSP, not allowing others to come
 - mujhe ajtak naseem or puure uttar pradesh ke logon ne nahin bataaya ki uski beti bhi he
 He only has boys
 mujhe maaloom tha ki usne anya sambandhi kii ladki god lee he
 - a man who cannot elect his boy
 wo apni takat bataa rahaa he
 In 1990, he contested in Banda Municipality, contested independently and lost badly
 ye takat bataate hai
 Did not win the election of chairman and shows his strength
 haarane ke baad inako laga ki bispi ke bina nahin jeet sakate
 In 1991, on the insistence of the BSP, they won the election
 - nasimuddin kii kaaryastylee kharaab thi usee ke chalate 1993 main chunaav haare, or phir kabhi chunaav nahin jeet paae
 How can a man who tapes the conversation of his leader be loyal
 aaj mujhe pachaa chalaa ki ye sach main taper or blackmailer he
 - There is no comparison to Satish Chandra Mishra
 apni bahanon se bhi zyada sammaan dete hai
 Has taken charge of the legal head of the party
 satish chandra mishra ne mujhe bataaya tha ki ve sabase zyada inakam tex dete the
 The whole family is highly respected
 - puure upi ke log kehete hai ki jab se aapane apane bhai ko party upaadhyaksh banaaya he, tabase inako zyada pareshaani he
 My brother will not become a leader, MLA and MP but will run the party
 - nasimuddin ke bare main manyavar kanshiram hameshaa kehete the ki is aadmi par bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Mayawati you be careful

 soshal media par in dinon ek video viral ho rahaa he jisamen dikh rahaa he ki bazaar kii sadakon par pani ke tej bahaav ke saath skuti, bike or auto rickshaw bahe ja rahe hai
 At the same time it is being claimed that these pictures of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's parliamentary constituency Varanasi show how bad there is? Is Varanasi really so distressed that the flood water is being washed away by vehicles in the city? It is being said that "prime Minister Modi's 4-year Varanasi MP is presenting report card, look development is flowing"
 video ko yahi capshan diya gaya he
 It can be seen in the video that many scooties, bikes and autos are drifting along the sharp edge of water on the market road in the rain
 video ko dekh kar aisa hi lagata he sailaab bazaar se guzar rahaa he or log dar ke maare kinare par bas tamashbin bane hue hai
 What is the connection of Prime Minister Modi and his parliamentary constituency Varanasi with the flow of vehicles in the booming water? To know this, the Fact Check team of India Today examined this video of 1 minute 13 seconds closely
 padtaal main kya sach saamne aayaa, wo aap tak pahunchane se pehle ye bataa den ki pradhanmantri or unke mantriyon ne kuch din pehle hi apane 4 saal ke kaarykaal kaa report card pesh kiya tha
 In such a situation, the video was shared with the hashtag of smart city Varanasi for the purpose of sarcasm on PM Modi

 There, India Today correspondent revealed that the heavy rainfall in Varanasi is far away; during the monsoon this year there was only a couple of drizzle
 samvaadadaata se bhi pushti hui ki video main dikh rahaa jaisaa koi bazaar varanasi main nahin he
 Now the question came that if the markets and roads seen in the video are not from Varanasi, then which city belongs to it
 khojbin se pataa chalaa ki ye video pradhanmantri modi ke sansadeey kshetra varanasi kaa nahin balki rajasthan ke shahar jodhpur kaa he
 Actually, these recordings were done during the heavy rains in Jodhpur on 1 July 2017 last year
 us vakt ghante bhar kii barish ke puure shahar kii sadaken talab jaisi najar aane lagi thim
 When their riders of vehicles also started flowing, people nearby rescued them
 jodhpur ke puraane ilaakon ke bare main ye kaha jaataa he ki vahaan jab bhi baari barish hoti he to pani ke nikaas ke pukhta intjaam nahin hone kii vajah se talab jaise halaat ban jate hai
 On 1 July 2017, after the heavy rains in Jodhpur, the difficult situation created by 'aaj Tak' showed a report, which can be seen here

 The year 2017 was very important for the Indian economy
 is saal jahaan desh main aarthik sudhaaron kii raftaar ko badhaate hue kai ahm faisle liye gaye
 The year started with the pressure of demonetisation, due to which no sector of the economy remained untouched

 Let us know what are the standards that act like a barometer in the country's economy during 2017
 jidipi main giravat kaa saljidipi growth ke lihaaj se 2017 utaar-chadhaav se bharaa rahaa
 Demonetisation and then GST during the whole year suffered a setback to the country's GDP growth

 However, in the third quarter of 2017 (july-september), the impact of GST and demonetisation was relieved and GST growth 6 once again

 mahangaai dar oktober main 3
 4-year high in November, up 58 percent
 88 fisadi par pahunch gaya
 According to the central government data, this increase in inflation is seen especially due to the rise in the prices of crude oil in the international market and the rise in the price of vegetables in the country

 However, Jim Sarbh is quite loud in character, which may not be liked by everyone
 bhansaali ke 'khilji' ranvir ko kisi lagi padmavat? 171 shabdon main likhakar batayagora badaljab bhi padmavat kaa zikr hota he to maharaval ratan singh ke senapati or mukhiya gora or badal kaa zikr bhi jarur hota he

 The release of 'padmavat' in Paharay, not screening in 4 states, is just a sabotage in Ghaziabad between Alauddin Khilji in Chetanfilm and Raja Maharawal Ratan Singh of Chittor
 haalanki malik mohammad jaaysi kii padmavat main is purohit ko tantric kaa darja diya gaya he
 Had Raghav Chetan not been present, perhaps Alauddin Khilji would not have noticed Padmavati and the Queen would not have to do Jauhar

 China is preparing to build a Joint Ocean Observatory (OBS) in the Maldives sea, which could prove to be another threat to India
 maldive ke vipaksh ke netaaon kaa daawa he ki yah vedhashala sainya jarurat puri karne vaali hogi or isamen ek pandubbi base bhi banaaya jayega
 According to the Times of India news, this observatory will be built at Makunudhu, which is located on the westernmost coral island at the northern end of the Maldives
 yah jagah bharat ke bahut kareeb he, isliye yah china ko hind mahaasaagar ke mahatvapurn jahaaj maarg par ek prekshan sthal muhaiyaa karegaa
 It is very close to the Indian maritime border, so there can be another negative point between the relationship between Maldives and India
 bhartiya adhikariyon ne is baat kii pushti kii he ki sanyukt vedhashala sthapit karne ke liye china or maldive ke bich pichley saal samjhaute ko antim rup diya gaya tha
 However, the officials said that they could not comment on this without knowing all the points of the agreement
 abhi tak china or maldive ne is project ke bare main zyada jaankaree saajha nahin kii he
 a leader of the Maldives' main opposition party, the MDP, says the challenge for India is to ensure that this observatory does not prove to be another tool for the alleged 'beads of pearl' strategy by China to surround India
 maale ke purv raashtrapati mohammad nashid ne akhbaar ko bataaya tha ki china ne maldive main 17 dweep hasil kar liye hai or is bare main kuch spasht nahin he ki china yahaan kis tarah kii gatividhiyaan kar rahaa he
 The problem for India is that this observatory raises the same concern as the announcement made last year by Beijing to build an observatory in the South China Sea
 samrik visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki ab bharat ko maldive ko bhi ek red line masale kii tarah dekhnaa chahie or use maldive tathachin sarkaarko yah chetavanee deni chahie ki vah samudr main aisi vedhashala ko bardaasht nahin karegaa
 However, given the current crisis in Maldives, it is very difficult for India to take any drastic step right now
 is prishthbhumi main bharat or china par antarrashtriya samudaay kii najar he
 India has distanced itself from military intervention in the Maldives and has insisted that President Abdullah Yameen uphold democratic functioning there
 maldive main is tarah kaa centre banane se china ko bharat ke khilaaf samudri morche par badhat mil sakati he

 The book is published by exclusive publication
 asagar vajahat hamaare samay main maujuud ek aisi sukhad upasthiti hai jinhen hindi sahitya kii kisi ek vidha ke andar simit kar nahin samajha ja saktaa
 He has given a masterpiece in many genres of creative Hindi prose
 upanyaas, kahani, naatak, laghukatha, katha aakhyaan or yatra sansmaran in sabhi gadhy vidhaon main unka lekhan sthaayee mahatv kaa he
 Pallava, the young critic and editor of Banas Jan Patrika, has presented an accumulation of his creativity in his editing
 yah sanchayan is drushti se mahatvapurn he ki iske jariye vajahat ke har pahalu kaa aswaad hi nahin miltaa varan unke rachanaatmak sarokaar se bhi ham avgat hote hai
 Among the compositions of Wajahat are taken in it are the novel Saat Akash, the narrative narrative of Bakarganj, the highly successful and popular Jis Lahore Nai Dekhya o Jamayi Nayi and godse-gandhi

 Through these, the creative stature of Wajahat and his contribution to Hindi literature can be understood
 hindi sahitya main aise anek udhaaharan maujuud hai jisamen ham pate hai ki kisi behtareen lekhak kii creative feelings ek kalkhand main thahar gayi
 Wajahat has transgressed this limit
 hindi kahani ke hi teen alag-alag daur kaa ve mukammal pratinidhitiv karte hai
 In the sixties, when despair was at its peak and relationship devaluing stories were in fashion, Wajahat wrote a fashion-like story, which is in extreme shocking condition but with a pleasant memory of the relationship
 jab janavaadee kahaniyon main naaron kaa ufaan tha tab unhone usee patibaddhta ko rachanaatmak abhivyakti di
 In the later nineties of the last century, there was a new emergence of communalism when he wrote a story of eternal importance like wounds on the pretense of the intellectual class while highlighting the acts of such powers
 saat aasmaan vajahat kaa behad prashansit upanyaas he jisamen unhone samaaj, parivaar or khandaan kii gaatha ke madhyam se ek samudaay vishesh kii samasik bhartiyata ko piroyaa he

 But when these tanks stopped working due to lack of maintenance, the people went to the old mlas, then they flouted and said that the responsibility of its maintenance is with the new government
 aakhir ye kiski jimmedaari he or kab in solar tankiyon kii kismat khulegi ye bada sawaal he? Due to repeated violations of ceasefire by Pakistan, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) said on Friday that the government should not hold any talks with Pakistan
 vishwa hindu parishad ke sanyukt mahasachiv surendra jain ne kaha, 'pakistan ke saath koi baatcheet nahin honi chahie
 Pakistan does not understand this language
 pakistan ke liye baatcheet kaa koi matlab nahin he
 The power of power in Pakistan is not in the hands of Nawaz Sharif

 ’ Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath reached Allahabad on April 7 for the first time after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) defeat in the Phulpur Lok Sabha by-election
 mauka kumbh kii yojanaon ke shilanyas se judaa tha lekin, upachunaav main haar kaa dard baahar aa hi gaya
 Surrounded by all-round criticism after the party's defeat in the Lok Sabha by-elections, the Chief Minister wants to wash away the stains of his failures through the world's largest religious event, Kumbh, to be held in January next year
 elahabaad ke parade maidan main yojit jansabha main kumbh ke liye 700 karod ru
 Through one hundred and fifty schemes of Yogi Adityanath, he wrote a new screenplay of development wrapped in Hindutva
 apane rajnatik jivan kii pehali badi chunavi haar ke baad yogi adityanath ke tevar bhi badale hue the
 No arrow shot at the opponents with the command of a yogi who fiercely targeted the opposition leaders in a packed meeting
 chunauti apni hi party ke netaaon ko saath lekar chalane kii he, isliye upmukhyamantri keshav prasad maury kii kaarykram main gaiyr-maujuudagi ke baavjood yogi adityanath ne unhen vikaas karne vaala netaa bataakar phulpur ke purv saansad kii anupasthiti se uthi ashankaon ko dabaane kii koshish bhi kii
 By making the Kumbh to be held in Allahabad before the Lok Sabha elections next year, the Yogi government wants to sharpen the agenda of "hindutva"
 pradesh sarkaar ne vishwa ke is sabase bade dharmik aayojan main 15 karod ke aasapaas shraddhaluon ke jutane kaa anumaan lagaaya he
 Professor Ajit Kumar at Banaras Hindu University explains, “the Ram temple issue in Ayodhya is still pending in the Supreme Court
 agle loksabhaa chunaav se pehle iskaa nateeja sambhawatah na aa paae
 In the Lok Sabha elections, instead of playing the Hindutva card through the temple issue, the BJP government at the Center and the state are all set to woo their target vote bank by organizing Kumbh
 '' yahi vajah he ki centre kii modi sarkaar or yogi sarkaar ne elahabaad ke liye khajaana khol diya he
 Controversy over the name of Kumbh The controversy started in the Yogi government's cabinet meeting on October 24 last year, after passing a resolution calling the Ardh Kumbh to be held at Prayag in six years and the Kumbh in 12 years as Mahakumbh
 vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa ram govind choudhary kehete hai, "pracheen kaal main ardhakumbh or kumbh ko lekar jo vyavastha chali aa rahi he use cabinet baithak ke jariye badalanaa anuchit he
 The BJP government of the state wants to use the ancient beliefs and legislation for its own benefit, it is an insult to the saints and mahatmas who have made these laws
 ''akhil bhartiya akhaada parishad ne bhi cabinet ke jariye ardhakumbh kaa naam badalakar kumbh karne ke faisle kii aalochana kii he
 a council official says, "saints can decide to name the Ardh Kumbh as Kumbh, but there must be a big reason for changing the tradition
 ''rajnatik vishleshak bhaajapa sarkaar ke is kadam ke peeche ek khaas ranneeti dekh rahe hai
 Shiv Shankar, assistant professor at the University of Allahabad, explains, “A grand event in the name of Ardh Kumbh could not be justified before the Lok Sabha elections
 isiilie sarkaar ne ardhakumbh kaa naam badalakar kumbh kiya taaki is naam ke saath baari-bharkam aayojan kiya ja sake
 However, while stating the government's decision as correct, state BJP spokesperson Chandramohan says, "in the Indian tradition, the concept of Purna and Purna has not been done and that is why Ardh Kumbh has been named Kumbh
 '' badlaav keval kumbh naam main hi nahin balki iske liye jari sarkari pratik chinh main bhi hua he
 On 12 December last year, the state government unveiled the Kumbha symbol depicting the temple and the urn
 kalash par swaastik chinh bana hua tha lekin, ek maheene baad sarkaar ne swaastik kii bajaae kalash par om likh diya
 The state government has engaged in branding of this mega event by using the Kumbh logo in every government advertisement, gifts and souvenirs

 In order to speed up the preparations for Kumbh, the state government constituted "prayag Raj Fair Authority" as Director, Panchayati Raj, posted the bright IAS officer Vijay Kiran Anand, who is advancing the cleanliness mission in UP, as the Kumbh Mela officer
 Have done kamisionar elahabaad mela praadhikaran ko adhyaksh or jiladhikari ko upaadhyaksh banaaya gaya he
 It is also a difficult challenge for these officers to complete tasks on time

 The rest will be purchased from the Steel Authority of India, Naini

 Lack of arrangement to keep them can make the checkered plates worse

 He says, "all preparations will be completed long before the Kumbh begins
 is baar kumbh kaa aayojan kai maamalon main abhootpurv hoga
 "it will not be easy to convince the Akharas that the reasons for losing the by-election were going on, that the saints who were angry with the preparations for Kumbh took the Yogi government on target
" elahabaad ke keedganj main 16 march ko panchayat bada udasin akhaada main baari gahamagahami ke saath subah 10 baje se kumbh kii taiyaariyon ko lekar akhil bhartiya akhaada parishad kii samiksha baithak shuru hui
 Shri Mahant Prem Giri, National Vice President of Shri Panchadashanam Juna Akhada demanded that arrangements should also be made in Prayag as per the arrangements made for the saints at Kumbh in Nashik and Ujjain
 santon kii mukhya maang tehraane ke liye sant nivas ke nirmaan se judi thi
 The saints alleged that the government wanted to build the rains and not the sant niwas

 The government eventually had to bow down

 Every year during the Magh Mela on the Sangam coast, Dandiswami town resides in 80 bigha area for the ascetics, but there is no such arrangement in Kumbh

 However, through the Kumbh event, the BJP government is preparing to play the Hindutva card smartly before the Lok Sabha elections but, how effective it will be, it will only tell the result of the election

 ', But perhaps the Trinamool Congress is the only party in the country that makes it work
 
 
 jab bhi trinmul congress netaa madan mitra jail se court aate hai, unke samarthak un par phulon kii varsha karte hai
 
 
 Despite going to jail for your information, Madan Mitra is still a cabinet minister in the Mamata Banerjee government
 
 
 so, swaagat he aapkaa, aaj ke bengal main, jahaan jail jane ke baavjood mantri se istipha nahin liya jaataa, or jail main bhi madan mitra ko ek mantri kaa protocol diya jaataa he
 
 
 In fact, Madan Mitra is accused of embezzling money in collusion with Saradha chief Sudipto Sen, and was arrested by the CBI after interrogation last month
 haalanki giraftaar ke baad mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne jamkar unka bachaav kiya tha, lekin sibiai kaa kahana he ki madan mitra ke khilaaf saboot itane pukhta hai ki unhen agle kai maheenon tak jail main band rahanaa hi hoga
 
 
 By the way, two Trinamool Rajya Sabha mps Kunal Ghosh and Srinjoy Bose are currently in jail in this case
 
 
 is baat main koi andeh nahin ki sharada group ke sambandh mamata banerjee, unki party trinmul se bhi achche rahe, or phir baad main unki sarkaar se bhi
 
 
 And the thing to remember is that when the relationship is good, both sides benefit, no one can deny this
 
 
 sibiai adhikariyon kii maane to baad main trinmul kii maang badhate jane ke kaaran sharada group kii mali haalat khasta hoti gai, or ek samay aisa bhi aayaa, jab sudipto sen ko laga ki vah apane niveshkon ko paise nahin de saktaa, so, niveshkon ke gusse kaa saamana karne se pehle hi sudipto ne police ke samaksh samarpan karnaa behatar samajha
 
 
 And today there is a big reason that no matter how much the Trinamool leaders and activists make a mistake that the CBI is acting at the behest of political masters, but the truth is that the evidence which the CBI has got, its logical Party leaders are unable to answer
 
 
 so, bijepi ke liye pashchim bengal main apane pair pasaarne or sarkaar ko gherne ke liye isse behatar vakt or mudda koi nahin ho saktaa
 
 
 The Left parties are trying to find the reasons for the defeat in the last assembly elections, and in the coming days, due to the CBI investigation, some other Trinamool leaders will also be in jail, so even if leaders like Mukul Roy reached the jail, neither By-elections to the Lok Sabha seat only, but also to the local body elections, may increase the Trinamool's odds

 The state government has approved a plan to sell foreign liquor at country liquor shops by changing the excise policy, but due to the code of conduct, it has been sent to the Election Commission for approval
 iske saath hi sharaab kii dukaanon ke liye license fees main bhi 20 fisadi kii badhotaree kaa jo prastaav cabinet ne haal hi main paas kiya tha use bhi nirvachan ayog kii anumati ke baad hi lagu kiya jayega
 The aim is to increase revenue revenue through excise duty, but due to the code of conduct, the government can implement it only after the approval of the Election Commission and not directly implement it
 aapako bataa den ki madhya pradesh main deshi-videshi madiraa kii kul milakar 3,200 dukaane hai, inamen se 2,200 ke kareeb deshi madiraa dukaane hai to vahiin 1,000 ke kareeb videshi madiraa dukaane hai
 It is evident that there are more country liquor shops in the state and the government will get an additional revenue of about Rs 1,450 crore on selling foreign liquor from the country liquor shop by not opening new shops

 "he said," This is a catastrophic move and a conspiracy to push the future of the state into the pit of intoxication
 meraa siem se aagrah he ki wo aise kadam na uthaaen or yah prastaav nirast karen
 i also appeal to the Election Commission not to approve this policy

 shainan ne vahi sawaal kiya, jo saare kar rahe the
 The answer was, but to increase the point, i asked a question to journalism student Shainen, why does Ambedkar matter so much to you
 wo bol to rahi thi hansate hue, magar uski ankhen chhalak gayi
 Sir, if Ambedkar were not there today, we would not have been here
 main aise nahin hoti
 i do not have this iphone in my hand
 hamaara camera uski ankhon main nahin jhaank sakaa, lekin main nazadik khadaa dekh rahaa tha ki ambedkar ke bare main kritagyata jataate hue uski ankhon se aansu kii dhar bah rahi thi
 Shannon hid this edge with her laughter, but her question was enough to force the other
 jis ambedkar ke kaaran shainan ke paas aaj sabakuch he, us ambedkar ko jab shainan akhabaaron yaa tivi main dhundti he, to nahin milte hai
 In terms of proportion, his talk may be debated, but there will be some basis, only then, except Shannon, every person on Parliament Street asked this question
 log puch rahe the, suna rahe the or bole ja rahe the
 You are the first one who came here for the shoot
 yahaan press kaa koi nahin aata
 See how crowded there is, but no coverage
 main yahaan tees saal se aa rahaa hum
 Was a child, but now i have become a grandfather, but till date i have not seen the coverage here in any newspaper
 aap aaj tak kyon nahin aae
 i kept going through the crowd listening to these questions
 ye sawaal unke bhi the, jo mere saath selfi khinchaana chaahate the or unke bhi jo is baat se khush the ki koi tivi vaala yahaan aayaa he
 There will be some existence of this question, due to which every other man was going to hear Ambedkar Jayanti celebrating me
 mujhe nahin maaloom ki nai dilli ke sansad maarg par lagane vaala yah mela agle din ke akhabaaron main kabhi chapa he yaa nahin
 Can not tell with the claim, but i can say very clearly that i do not remember
 mere paas yah kehane kaa koi bhi pramaan nahin he ki ambedkar jayanti kii kawarej news channelon par nahin hua hoga
 But when the question of so many people becomes pain instead of question, then one has to think or think why someone is saying this
 nai dilli ke sansad maarg ke bare main koun nahin jaanata hoga
 AIR is the headquarters of the Reserve Bank of India, NITI Aayog, Parliament is Annexe
 jab se dilli aayaa hum, tab se sunata aa rahaa hum ki vahaan 14 april ke rose bahut bada mela lagata he
 a day in advance, different types of stalls are ready and thousands of people are waiting in queues for hours to see when their turn will come, and they flower in the statue of Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar within Parliament Can
 kai saal pehle jab 14 april ke din sansad maarg par gaya, tab reporting nayaa-nayaa sikh rahaa tha
 From then on this day is not there, but has gone elsewhere
 aaj bhi nahin jaataa, magar agra main lagane vaali bhim nagari ke aayojan ke samay ke kaaran sansad maarg kaa hi vikalp batch gaya tha
 There was a view of the fair on Parliament Street
 hazaron kii bheed aa ja rahi thi
 The people who came came dressed like a baraati
 koi dilli ke baahar se tha, to koi dilli ke gaanvon se
 The crowd, including doctors, revenue officers, police officers, lawyers, bank employees, was the whole section, who thanked Dr
 Ambedkar for his life
 unki puja karata he or pyaar karata he
 That's why many people said that if you would say Baba Saheb instead of Dr
 Ambedkar, we would love it
 ham baba sahab se bahut pyaar karte hai
 While talking, many people got teary eyes
 bhandara or lungar kii bharmaar thi, to baba sahib kii murtiyon khub bik rahi thim
 In the role of Constituent Constituents, the buyers of his picture were seen
 is meley main kai tarah ke saamaajik andolan ke stall lage the
 People were shouting slogans to save daughter and child labor at a stall

 On the day of April 14, numerous seminars, conferences and fairs are held regarding Ambadekar
 shahar se lekar gaanv tak main
 Ambedkar's loved one complains that the media does not cover him
 agar kisi bhi tareeke se yah shikaayat sahi he to media ko sochna chahie
 This is not the first time this question has been asked
 kuch hi din pehle iaiti dilli main ek noujvaan chaatr ne yahi sawaal kiya tha
 Did not know why the number of people asking this question is increasing
 vyaktigat str par bahut khush hum
 Even as a consumer, the reader becomes the right of the viewer, they ask why this birth anniversary is sidelined
 darasal darkinar nahin kiya jaataa
 Our political parties are high jacked by the celebrations of Ambedkar Jayanti
 unke bayaan or daavon ke bich hi baba sahab kii praasangikta kaa vivechan hokar rah jaataa he
 Amidst the rallies and races of parties with different names, cameras are never seen that people also celebrate Ambedkar's birth anniversary
 channelon par ab pehle se kahin zyada ambedkar jayanti ko lekar kaarykram ho jate hai, magar yah ho saktaa he ki nai raajnneetik daavedaariyon kii pratikriya main aisa kiya jaataa ho
 We have made Ambedkar's presence in the public media so artificial and opportunistic that we forget that someone remembers Baba Saheb, he laughs and some thankfully shout slogans like in his life
 An angel has arrived
 lok utsav main ambedkar yaa ambedkar kaa lokarup to kahin nahin dikhataa
 Shannon has asked me the same question as to why not
 anoushka sharma kii haal hi main relies hui film 'pari' ko logon kaa mila-jula rispons mila he
 Some people liked this film and some people rejected it
 ab khabaron kii maane to film ko tamil bhashaa main banane kii taiyaari kii ja rahi he
 a source associated with the film said- 'pari' became a hit due to its script and the risk of making a superstar horror film
 sabane is faisle ko notice kiya
 Pari will soon be a Tamil remake
 acchhee horer kahaniyon ko log pasand karte hai or producers ne bhi pari ko pasand kiya he
 It will be announced after the deal is done
 yah anoushka ke liye bahut badi safalataa he
 Anushka's 'pari', which debuted at the box office on the first day, is the third film produced by Anushka
 isse pehle wo 'enech 10' or 'fillori' jaisi film produs kar chuki hai
 'NH10' was a road thriller film and 'pari' was a supernatural drama film
 Pari Review: daraane ke saath-saath behtareen kahani bhi sunaati he 'pari'anoushka ne in donon filmon se ye sabit kar diya he ki wo filmon ko lekar risk lene se nahin ghabraati hai or jo script unhen bha jaati he use lekar wo film banane se peeche nahin hatati hai

 Bruce Jenner won a gold medal in the Decathelon at the 1976 Montreal Olympics
 dekathelon yani das khelon kii pratiyogita jisamen duniya bhar ke mardon kii asli takat kaa imtihaan hota he
 But when Bruce ran, there was a woman inside him
 vah lagaataar unke bheetar daudti rahi
 She has come out after 64 years
 uske baahar aane se duniya hairaan he
 She is seeing that the woman she identified as a man in so many years, that woman came out
 lekin itane baras tak bruce ne ye sachai kyon chhupaae rakhi? kya ve ab tak darati raheen? yaa wo isse bekabar thim? It is also possible that the man within Bruce wanted to kill this woman - he was repeatedly crushed, pressed inside himself
 lekin auraten pitati hai, dabati hai, aasaani se marati nahin
 a soul inside them burns like a flame
 vah lau bruce ke bheetar bhi jalati rahi or usne akhirkaar apana ek jism, apana ek aakaar hasil kar liya
 He got his sex change and is now Caitlyn Jenner
 yahi nahin, is umr main unhone venity fere ke liye photo shoot kiya he
 Why does Bruce Jenner's story touch us? Being a woman is not easy in our society
 iske liye badi keemat chukaani padati he
 Everyone assumes that being a woman means being weak
 sab uskaa imtihaan lenaa chaahate hai
 If the woman also moves forward, she tries to be male many times
 lekin yahaan ek mard he jo aurat banakar khush he
 Because in this he finds his existence meaningful
 tippaniyan This makes sense that the social crusades we have made of the woman and the man are not the last, which has made the understanding that the woman is physically weak and the man strong, she is not right
 darasal har stri ke bheetar ek purush hota he, har purush ke bheetar ek stri
 The man first kills this woman within him and then, in a guilt sense, considers women from all over the world as his own
 lekin ek stri apane bheetar ke purush ko bhi paal leti he or khud ko bhi bachaae rakhti he- shaayad isiilie ye sambhav hota he ki ek olympic vijeta apana jeeta hua sona, apana banaaya hua record, apni hasil kii hui shoharat or apana basaaya hua parivaar- sab jaise chhodkar apane vajood ko talashta he or phir mahasoos karata he ki vah darasal stri he- sabase sundar baat ye he ki is mahasoos karne main na koi sankoch he, na satahipan, bas ek maanviya abhimaan jo apni nai pahchaan bana rahaa he
 She kept running within them constantly
 puure 64 baras baad wo baahar ai he
 The world is shocked by his exit
 wo dekh rahi he ki apane jis sitare ko wo itane saare barason main mard kii tarah pahachaanati rahi, wo aurat nikali
 But why did Bruce hide this truth for so many years? Has she been afraid yet? Or was she oblivious to it? ye bhi sambhav he ki bruce ke bheetar ke mard ne is aurat ko maarna chaha ho- use apane bheetar baar-baar kuchlaa ho, dabaaya ho
 But women thrash, stifle, do not die easily
 unke bheetar ek aatma jaise kisi lau kii tarah jalati rahati he
 The flame kept burning inside Bruce and he finally regained his body, his shape
 unhone apana yon-parivartan karaayaa or ab wo ketalin jiner hai
 Not only this, at this age he has done a photo shoot for Vanity Fair
 bruce jiner kii kahani hamen kyon chooti he? hamaare samaaj main aurat hona aasaan kaam nahin he
 It costs a lot
 sab jaise maan kar chalate hai ki aurat hone kaa matlab kamazor hona he
 Everyone wants to test it
 aurat bhi aage badhati he to kai baar mard hone kii koshish karti he
 But here is a man who is happy to be a woman
 kyonki isi main use apana vajood sarthak lagata he
 The comments isse ye samaj main aata he ki aurat or mard ke jo saamaajik kathghare hamane banaae hai, ve antim nahin hai, jo yah samaj banaai he ki aurat jismani taur par kamazor hoti he or mard majboot, vah sahi nahin he
 Actually there is a man inside every woman, a woman inside every man
 purush pehle apane bheetar kii is stri ko martha he or phir ek aparaadh bodh main jeeta duniya bhar kii auraton ko apane se hey samajhataa he
 But a woman also takes care of her inner man and protects himself - perhaps that is why it is possible that an Olympic winner will win his gold, his record, his fame and his family
 Everyone, leaving everything, seeks their existence and then realizes that she is actually a woman - the most beautiful thing is that there is no hesitation, nor superficiality, just a human pride Company is making new acquaintances
 ye bhi sambhav he ki bruce ke bheetar ke mard ne is aurat ko maarna chaha ho- use apane bheetar baar-baar kuchlaa ho, dabaaya ho

 Whenever any discussion on the burning issue of corruption during the Congress supremacy in the Saamna editorial, Saamna wrote that the mess was a tradition of scandal, corruption and irresponsibility
 is adhiveshan main desh kii rajkeey paristathita kaa gauge liya gaya
 Different questions were discussed
 pehle kaamanwealth or ab adarsh building kaa ghotaalaa
 Because of these scams, the introduction of Congress culture and culture has come to the whole country
 aisa hote hue bhi sonia gandhi apane party ke logon ko congressi mulya kaa paalan kare esa aadesh karti he
 What could be more fun than this
 congress or mulya kaa kahin mail nahin he
 Moderation, loyalty and straightforwardness came to an end with Mohandas Karmchand Gandhi
 kaamanwealth or adarsh building ke ghotaalon ne aam logon ko congress kaa matlab acchhee tarah se samajha diya he
 If the Congress government had acted against these scamsters, then the Congress's image would have improved
 lekin sonia kii baton se to lagata he kii wo apane party ke logon ko ye samajhaana chaahati hai kii ghotaalaa karo
 
 
 But don't let him come in front of people
 adarsh ghotaale ne to congress party kaa puri tarah vastraharan kar diya he
 Shinseena also has problems with the smiling face of Chief Minister Ashok Chavan
 akhbaar main likhaa he kii kargil yuddh main maare gaye logon ke pariwaron ko hadapnevaale netaa chavaan kaa muskuraataa cheharaa congress ke mulyon ko achche se darshata he
 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is to be sworn in for 12 days
 in 12 dinon main puri duniya ne bullate train se bhi tej nirnay lene vaala mukhyamantri dekha
 Yogi Adityanath has issued more than 100 decrees in his first 10 days
 yogi lagaataar daftar dar daftar, aspataal, thana har jagah khud gum kar muyna kar rahe hai
 The entire Uttar Pradesh government is seen in action
 lekin phir bhi uttar pradesh kii 22 karod janata ko abhi jiskaa intjaar he wo yogi nahin kar rahe hai
 Yes, the people of UP are only waiting for the first cabinet meeting of Yogi, but Yogi is not taking the meeting itself
 bin cabinet hai yogi ke farmaan
 
 
 The Chief Minister has taken swift decisions so far
 kuch faisle to aise hai jinaki charchaa desh bhar main ho rahi he, jaise kii boojadkhaanon par roak, anti romeo daste kaa gathan or adhikariyon ke paan-gutkha, masala khaane par roak va anya kai faisle
 But one thing is very common in all these decisions is that all these decisions have been taken without a cabinet meeting
 inkaa aadesh yaa to mukhyamantri ke twitor acount se aayaa he, yaa phir press vijyapti se
 What will happen to the first cabinet
 
 
 uttar pradesh kii janata ko jiscabinet baithkka intjaar he, darasal us baithak main bijepi kaa sabase bada chunavi vaada chupa he
 The debt waiver decision of farmers, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has repeated in almost every election rally
 bijepi kaa vaada tha ki sarkaar banane ke baad jab bhi pehali cabinet kii baithak hogi, tabhi kisaanon kaa karj maaf kar diya jayega
 But even after 12 days when the meeting will be held, nothing is known
 upi sarkaar ko lagbhag 20 hajaar karod rupee se zyada kaa karja maaf karnaa he
 So, they are not meeting
 
 
 yogi adityanath ke sabhi faisle soshal media par charchaa kaa vishay ban gayi hai, phir chaahe vah avaidh boojadkhaanon par pabandi ho yaa phir anti romeo dasta
 There is a flood of trolls day by day over Yogi's decisions
 to vahiin soshal media vaale bhi pehali cabinet baithak kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Many people also cited many interesting reasons for not taking a cabinet meeting
 zaraa padhiye, aap bhi in kaarnon ko -1
 It is now Navratri, so people are saying on social media that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is on the fast of Navratri, he is not consuming food himself
 yahi kaaran he ki vah kisaanon kaa karja nahin maaf kar rahe hai, kyonki navaratri tak unka ann se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 As soon as his fast is over, he will forgive the debtor of the Annadata
 isaliye navaratri ke khatm hone kaa intjaar karen
 2
 yogi ko 'meet'ing pasand nahin he!yogi sarkaar ke boojadkhaanon par pabandi lagane se puure pradesh main meet kii kami ho gai he
 So there is a competition to comment on this on social media too
 cabinet meeting ko lekar logon ne bada hi sahi bahaanaa nikaala he
 People write that because Yogi Adityanath does not like to 'meet' ing, that is why the cabinet meeting is not taking place
 3
 Home entry, then kitchen entry! Yogi was not staying in the Chief Minister's residence yet, staying in the VVIP guest house
 haalanki ab vah apane mukhyamantri awaas main grih pravesh kar chuke hai
 People believe that because now the Chief Minister has entered the house, he will also enter the kitchen in his house, and when he enters the kitchen, he will remember the Annadata farmers only then the loan will be forgiven
 4
 Jumla hai bhai, jumla! People are still stinging that Rs 15 lakh in the accounts of everyone during the Lok Sabha elections, which Amit Shah later referred to as jumla
 ab cabinet kii baithak main ho rahi lagaataar deree se bhi logon ko vahi dar sata rahaa he, tabhi log kah rahe hai ki yah bhi pehle kii tarah jumala hi tha
 Which was limited to election speech only
 note -yah sabhi kaaran soshal media par lagaataar chal rahe jokes or trol se liye gayi hai
 Due to privacy, tweets and posts related to them are not shown here
 2019 ke aagaaj main chand din bache hai or yah saal modi sarkaar ke liye kaaphi ahm mana ja rahaa he
 In fact, Lok Sabha elections are going to be held in a few months and this is no less than an audit for the Modi government
 aise main chunaav se pehle sarkaar kisaanon ko lubhaane ke liye kai badi yojanaon kaa elaan kar sakati he
 According to the report of Business Standard on the idea of telangana plan, according to the Modi government, the government is exploring the possibility of helping farmers in some income
 iske liye telugana kii 'raiyat bandhu' yojana ko thodaa badlaav kar deshbhar main lagu karne par vichaar ho rahaa he
 Under the 'ryot Bandhu' i
e
 Krishak Mitra scheme, the Telangana government gives an amount of Rs
 4000 per acre per year to the farmers
 yani telugana ke kisaanon ko har saal 8000 rupee prati acre milte hai
 It has nothing to do with the government's holdings
 pichley saal rajya sarkaar kii ore se is yojana par 12,000 karod rupee kharch kiye gaye
 According to the report, the plan can be announced in the interim budget of 2019-20 or after the conclusion of the winter session
 iske alaava pehle charan main laghu or seemaant kisaan ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Explain that there are about 9 to 11 crore small and marginal farmers across the country
 isse pehle telugana kii tarj par odisha or jharkhand kii sarkaron ne bhi raiyat bandhu jaisi yojana lagu karne kaa elaan kar chuki hai
 Thoughts are being made on these options too! Apart from this, many options are being churned to give relief to the farmers
 report ke mutabik modi sarkaar ke vibhinn mantralayon or adhikariyon ke bich chote or seemaant kisaanon ko muft main fasal beemaa dene or udhari yojanaon main kuch pherbadal karne par bhi charchaa hui he
 Explain that at present, under the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, a premium of 2 to 5 per cent is charged from farmers for different crops
 report main bataaya gaya he ki kisaanon ko aay muhaiyaa karaane kii yojana par sarkari khajaane par shuruaati daur main kareeb 600 se 700 arab rupee kaa boj aane kaa anumaan he
 It is being considered that how much will the Center and the states share in the total expenditure in this plan

 bollywood ke diggaj sitaron kii do badi filmein is shuukravaar relies hone ja rahi hai
 One is Sanjay Leela Bhansali's dream project i
e
 'bajirao Mastani' and the other is Rohit Shetty's action packed romantic film 'dilwale' with Bollywood super duper hit couple Shah Rukh and Kajol
 jaahir si baat he jahaan shahrukh kaajol hai to darshakon ko ek vijual dilite milanaa laazmi he
 But Deepika is not far behind in this race
 Deepika's payment is not an introduction
 to sawaal yah uthta he ki aakhir darshak is shuukravaar kis film ko dekhnaa chaahate hai
 When this question was asked on the Aaj Tak poll, 75 on this question
 1% logon ne bajirao ke liye hami bhari or keval 24
 9% of readers expressed a desire to see 'dilwale'
 in aankadon se yah saaf jaahir he kifilm 'bajirao mastaani'main deepika or ranvir singh kii chemistry barason se golden jodi kahi jane vaali shahrukh kaajol kii jodi par baari pad gai he
 Well, there is no doubt that both the films are made in big budget and both are expected to earn well at the box office
 lekin shahrukh kaajol kifilm 'dilavaale'ko aakhir riders kyon nakaarte najar aa rahe hai
 However, let me tell you that the negative effect of Shahrukh's intolerance on many riders is visible in his comments
 kyonki kai riders ne unhen deshadrohi kahkar unki film ko naa dekhne kaa man bana liya
 However, Shah Rukh Khan on Wednesday apologized for his intolerant statement
 bijepi or nitish kumaar kii nazdikiyon ko lekar atakalon kaa bazaar garm ho gaya he
 Late Friday evening, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has placed Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in two committees formed to celebrate the birth centenary of Bharatiya Jana Sangh founder and senior RSS leader Deendayal Upadhyay
 is samiti main jediu ke purv adhyaksh sharad yadav ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he
 NCP President Sharad Pawar and former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda have also been included in this committee
 bijepi netaaon kaa kahana he ki dinadayal upaadhyaay mahapurush the or unke janm shatabdi kaarykram main sabhi dalon ko aage aana chahie
 However no leader from Congress has been included in this committee
 tippaniyan This is not the first time that the BJP and Nitish Kumar are speculating about their closeness
 mohammad shahabuddin kii jamaanat ke baad se nitish ke sahyogi argedy ke kuch netaaon ke tikhe bayanon ne jediu ko baichaiyn kar rakhaa he
 In the Congress, another ally of the Nitish government, different opinions have come up on this issue
 haalanki baad main argedy pramukh lalu prasad yadav ne saaf kar diya ki nitish hi gathbandhan ke netaa rahenge, lekin is taaja ghatnakram ne kai sawaal jarur khadey kar die hai, kyonki haal ke dinon main aise kai sanket mili hai, jinamein pradhanmantri or nitish kumaar ke nazdikiyon kii atakalon ko bal miltaa he
 On Goods and Services Tax, GST, Nitish Kumar blindly supported the central government
 piem ne raashtrapati bhawan main rashtriya ekta parishad kii baithak main nitish kumaar ke bhaashan kii jamkar tarif kii
 When Nitish Kumar met PM Modi on the issue of silt deposition in the Ganges, the Prime Minister immediately called the officers and directed them to try to resolve the issue
 bihar main sadak pariyojnaon ke bare main kendriya sadak parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ne teji laane ke nirdesh die hai
 When asked about this, BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain says that everyone comes together to make the programs of national men
 jab ye poocha gaya ki kya bijepi or jediu ke bich koi khichdi pak rahi he is par unka kahana tha ki aisa nahin he
 bjp's slogan is Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas
 udhar, nitish kumaar kaa naaraa aresas mukt bharat banane kaa he
 In such a situation, his participation in the committee of Deen Dayal Upadhyay, the RSS pracharak and senior leader, is obviously raising many questions
 shuukravaar ko hi bijepi mahasachiv ram madhav ne dinadayal upaadhyaay ko sangh parivaar kaa vaicharik pramukh bataaya tha
 However, JDU leaders say that there is no need to read much about it, because the Jana Sangh and the Samajwadi Party came together in the name of non-congressism, but also the Left parties have been involved in this
 haalanki ab halaat badal chuke hai
 non-congressism has been replaced by non-bjpism
 bijepi ke khilaaf adhikansh partiyaan ekajute ho rahi hai
 In Bihar, JDU-RJD and Congress contested against BJP alliance and won a landslide victory
 lekin jediu or argedy ke rishton main khatas aane kii khabaron ke bich taaja ghatnakram raajnneetik taur par behad dilachasp mana ja rahaa he
 There is also the question that when Nitish Kumar is moving forward to fulfill his ambition to become Prime Minister, how can he come together with BJP in future
 ye pehali baar nahin he, jab bijepi or nitish kumaar kii najdiki ko lekar kayaas lag rahe hai
 The sharp statements by some leaders of RJD, Nitish's ally since Mohammad Shahabuddin's bail, have left the JDU restless
 nitish sarkaar ke ek anya sahyogi dal congress main bhi is mudde par alag-alag raay saamne ai he
 Although later RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav made it clear that Nitish will remain the leader of the coalition, but this latest development has certainly raised many questions, because in recent times, there have been many indications in which the Prime Minister and Nitish Kumar's Closer speculation adds strength
 vastu evam seva kar yani jiesti par nitish kumaar ne centre sarkaar ko ankhen moond kar samarthan diya
 PM praised Nitish Kumar's speech at the National Integration Council meeting in Rashtrapati Bhavan
 ganga main gaad jamane ke mudde par jab nitish kumaar piem modi se mili, to pradhanmantri ne turant hi afasaron ko bulaakar is mudde ke hal ke prayaas ke nirdesh die
 Regarding road projects in Bihar, Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari has given instructions to expedite
 is bare main poochne par bijepi ke pravaktaa shahanvaj hossain kehete hai ki rashtrapurushon ke kaarykram banane main sab saath aate hai
 When asked if there is any khichdi between BJP and JDU, he said that it is not so
 bijepi kaa naaraa sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas he
 On the other hand, Nitish Kumar's slogan is to make RSS free India
 aise main aresas ke prachaarak or varisht netaa rahe dinadayal upaadhyaay ke janm shatabdi samaaroh kii samiti main unka liya janaa jaahir he kai sawaal khadey karata he
 On Friday, BJP general secretary Ram Madhav called Deendayal Upadhyay as the ideological head of the Sangh Parivar
 haalanki jediu netaaon kaa kahana he ki isamen zyada kuch nahin padhane kii jarurat nahin he, kyonki gaiyrcongresavad ke naam par jansangh or samaajawaadee dal saath aae the, balki isamen vampanthi partiyaan bhi shaamil rahi hai
 However, the situation has changed now
 gaiyrcongresavad kii jagah gairbhajapavad ne le lee he
 Most parties are uniting against the BJP
 bihar main jediu-argedy or congress ne bijepi gathbandhan ke khilaaf chunaav ladaa or shandaar jeet hasil kii
 But amid the news of souring relations between JDU and RJD, the latest developments are being considered politically very interesting
 sawaal yah bhi he ki jab nitish kumaar pradhanmantri banane kii apni mahatvakanksha ko puraa karne ke liye aage bad rahe hai, aise main vah bhavishya main bijepi ke saath aakhir kaise aa sakate hai

 Due to the impact of climate change on poor countries, rich countries had to give them heavy compensation so that they can face the opposite situation
 yuanegsisisi ke mutabik, vikasshil deshon ko isse hone vaali kshati kii bharpai ke liye viksit deshon ko unhen prativarsh 400 arab dollar muhaiyaa karaane honge
 But the highest ever payment of 100 billion dollar compensation was made by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown
 yah aankada bhi ghat gaya he or viksit desh sirf 40 arab dollar dena chaahate hai or vah bhi keval sabase kam vikasshil deshon ke liye
 Industrial countries were also required to provide clean technology so that developing countries could reduce their emissions
 lekin in deshon ne bauddhik sampada adhikaar kaa mudda uthaaya he or ab praudyogiki gyaan kii jagah sirf soochnaaon ke aadan-pradaan par baat ho rahi he
 So why is the US, where the per capita GHG emissions are 18 times that of the average Indian, refusing to obey the terms even though the President has spoken about changing the US policy? The simple answer is: There are many big lobbies who are spending $ 300 million every year to maintain the status quo
 inamen koyala lobby shaamil he jisaki paith 50 main se 22 rajyon main he
 Then there is the oil lobby, which George Bush was close to
 ye lobbiyaan automobile or hive lobby ke atirikt hai
 So even though Obama has promised to cut carbon emissions by 17 percent by 2020, he will have to face a lot of difficulty in doing so in the Senate
 aashcharya nahin ki kioto protocol main america kii ore se baatcheet karne vaale tatkaaleen up-raashtrapati al gore ko seenet ne 95-0 se nakaar diya tha-jiske baad america ke bare main tamaam asuvidhajanak sachaaiyaan ujagar ho gai thim
 America's main argument is that Kyoto did not include China and India, the two largest GHG emitting countries in the world
 china ek visangati he kyonki isane jiechaji utsarjan ke maamle main america ko bhi peeche chhod diya he or aarthik pragati ke saath vikasshil deshon kii kaksha se teji se baahar aa rahaa he
 China knows it will take nearly a decade to rein in GHG emissions or bring in green technology
 tab utsarjan kam karne par uske vikaas par koi asar nahin padegaa
 So until recently he was refusing to cut voluntarily, without any restriction
 lekin pichley maheene raashtrapati hu jintao ne ghoshnaa kii ki china apane yahaan carbon utsarjan main 40 fisadi kii katautee karegaa
 This amount is nothing compared to what is being developed from developed countries, as they are expected to eliminate the entire emissions, while the emissions are related to the energy used to add every dollar to GDP
 
 vaastavik arthon main china ke utsarjan str main kami nahin aegi-sirf gati dhimi hogi
 American maladjustment has spread to Europe like a virus
 ab europe bhi baari katautee ke apane vaade se peeche hatane laga he, jo unhone shuru main kiya tha
 At one time, Europe was talking about a 50 per cent reduction in GHG emissions by 2050
 lekin europe utsarjan main katautee karke apane kattar pratidwandvi america ke mukaable audyogic pratispardhaa main peeche nahin rahanaa chahta
 The cut will increase production costs
 paramparaagat eendhan ke mukaable punahprayog main aane vaali urja mahangi padati he
 For some time, when oil prices were at $ 160 per barrel, alternative energy seemed promising
 lekin tel kii keemten prati bairal 70 dollar par aane ke baad ye aashaaen dhoomil pad gayi
 The only thing that has shocked the negotiations on climate change the most is the economic depression
 rojgaar suraksha pehali praathamikta ban gai he
 When developed countries are trying to reduce the unemployment rate, they will not want any change in lifestyle or manipulation of the economy
 isliye pichley do varshon se ve aapas main milakar kioto protocol ko nishphal karne kii sajeesh main jute gaye hai
 Australia, which has been at the forefront of per capita GHG emissions, has been refusing to join the protocol for years, forming a bloc of wealthy countries
 jab vahaan kevin red pradhanmantri bane to unhone antat uskaa samarthan kiya lekin uske baad se australia protocol ke siddhanton ko nasht karne main laga rahaa he
 Prior to Copenhagen, Australia had put forward a proposal that sought to bridge the gap between developed and developing countries when it comes to commitment
 kioto protocol main mana gaya tha ki audyogic deshon par aitihaasik jimmedaari he kyonki unhone pichhali do sadiyon main vaataavaran main tanon jiechaji kaa utsarjan kiya he
 These countries will not only have to cut emissions but also have to help developing countries financially
 china or bharat samet ji-77 deshon ne paaya ki yah prastaav puure protocol ko hi palat dene kaa prayaas he taaki is par nae sire se baatcheet ho
 He immediately rejected it
 is bich amir deshon ne zyada jaruratmand deshon ko vittiya madad dene kaa prastaav dekar ji-77 deshon main foot daalane kii koshish kii, khaskar maldive jaise dweepiya deshon ko, jo khatre main hai
 To keep China and India, who have received huge amount under clean development system, he said that more compensation will be given to save the forests
 is prakaar van kataai or vinaash se utsarjan main kami ke liye ek kosh jari kiya gaya jo brazil or indonesia jaise deshon ko apane jangalon ko bachaane main madad karegaa
 After developing countries failed to soften, developed countries are now insisting on a Danish proposal that would be a political compromise coming out of Copenhagen
 'plage and rivyuu' naam ke is prastaav ko ji-77 or china pehle hi kioto protocol ke mukhya praavdhaanon ko nasht karne ke prayaas ke taur par dekh rahe hai
 If there is no reasonable agreement in Copenhagen, then leaders will have to face the anger of the general public across the world
 khaskar audyogic deshon main, jinhen apane swaarth ke kaaran prithvi ke dushman ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 Film 2012 may not come true before our apprehension
 kisaan andolan jab bhi hota he, focus unki upaj ke daam na milane par kam hota he, shaharon main fal-sabzi or doodh ke daam badhane par zyaada hota he
 If you watch TV, we reporter-anchors will be less visible among the farmers, they keep asking prices in the mandis
 iske kai kaaran hai
 
 
 There is no time to discuss it
 november 2009 kii ek ghatana bataanaa chahta hum
 a large number of farmers came to Delhi from western Uttar Pradesh
 agle din dilli ke akhabaaron main jo hedline chhapi wo kamaal kii thi
 The headline of a Hindi newspaper was - farmers bowed down to the government angrezi ke ek akhbaar kii hedline thi- BITTER HARVEST,THEY PROTESTED,DRANK,VANDALISED AND PEED
 Meaning, bad crop, they protested, drunk, vandalized and urinated
 tab se lekar ab tak media ke bade hisse main kisaanon ke prati nazariyaa nahin badla he
 Six farmers protesting in Madhya Pradesh have been killed
 yah isi desh main ho saktaa he ki rajya kaa grahamantri kah de ki vahaan maujuud police or siarpief main se kisi ne goli nahin chalaai, magar kisaan mare goli se hi
 After 24 hours, the IG police say that the police fired the bullet, but it does not say that the 6 farmers who died are killed by the police
 mangalvaar tak grahamantri kehete rahe ki madhyapradesh main do zilon ko chhodkar kahin par kisaanon kii taraf se koi andolan nahin he
 On Wednesday, the IG is saying that ten CRPF companies have been sought from Delhi
 grahamantri kii baat par yakeen kar lete to pradhanmantri kisaanon kii sthiti par dilli main charchaa nahin karte or na hi krishi mantri radha mohan singh tay press conference radd karte
 By the way, the Agriculture Minister was going to hold a press conference on Swachhta Pakhwada and not on the Kisan agitation
 buudhvaar ko indore, ujjain, devas main kai jagahon par hinsa kii ghatana hui hai
 Curfew was imposed in many places and mobile internet service was discontinued

 Internet is closed at many places in the state, yet the Chief Minister is tweeting
 unhone kaha he ki ve khud ek kisaan hai or unki pareshaani samajhate hai
 The government will implement all your things

 Within these newspapers two-two-page advertisements of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare were found
 just asking
 After reading this advertisement, it was felt that the government has so many achievements in the field of farming that it cannot be counted in less than two pages

 What insurance does one get by taking insurance? isi saal 7 april ko rajyasabha main krishi rajya mantri ne kapil sibbal ke sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki 2016 ke kharif sizan main yani dhan ke sizan main kisaanon ne 4, 270 karod kaa beemaa daawa kiya tha, magar unhen mila sirf 714 karod
 This is data as of 7 April 2017
 aap samaj sakate hai ki beemaa cover khareednaa aasaan he, beemaa lenaa aasaan nahin he
 This is why there is something in advertising, there is something on the streets
 aap ye jawaab rajyasabha kii website par jaakar check kar sakate hai
 In 2014, the BJP promised that it would give value by adding fifty percent of the profits to the cost when it came to power
 sarkaar ne sapreme court main kaha ki nahin de sakate
 On May 28, BJP President Amit Shah says two things in this context
 pehla ki laagat main zamin kii laagat jodakar koi bhi sarkaar swaminathan formule ko lagu nahin kar sakati he
 Then they calculate their own
 laagat mulya main zamin kii laagat gata dete hai or kehete hai ki sarkaar ne laagat se 43 fisadi zyaada nunatam samarthan mulya diya he
 They are not saying about all the crops or it is not clear about any one crop, but the matter of 43 percent higher price was published by the media as the headline
 mangalvaar ko prime time main hi devinder sharma ne kaha ki agar aisa hua hota to sarkaar har vigyaapan or press conference main daawa kar rahi hoti
 We searched a lot in this two-page advertisement, which was claimed by Amit Shah on 28 May
 aap yakeen nahin karenge ki do panne ke vigyaapan main nunatam samarthan mulya ke bare main koi zikr hi nahin he
 So what Amit Shah knows, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare does not know

M
 es swaminathan kii ek kitaab kaa locarpan kiya tha
 On this occasion, the Prime Minister said that Dr
 swaminathan kii khubi yah he ki unka kaam vyavhaarik vaastaviktaaon par aadhaarit he
 Amit Shah says that by adding the cost of land, no government can pay fifty percent of the cost
 nunatam samarthan mulya dene se saare kisaanon ko nunatam samarthan mulya nahin mil jaataa he
 In the same month, among the agricultural scientists in Delhi, India's Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian said that the government tried its best to buy pulses at the minimum support price
 iske baad bhi 60 fisadi kisaanon ko nunatam samarthan mulya se kam par daalen bechni padin
 Even after doing its best, the government was able to give minimum support price to 40 percent farmers

 Since then, a large part of the media has not changed the attitude towards farmers
 madhyapradesh main pradarshan kar rahe chah kisaanon kii hatya ho gai he
 It may be in this country that the State Home Minister can say that no one from the police and CRPF present there fired, but the farmer died from the bullet
 24 ghante ke baad aiji police bayaan dete hai ki goli police ne chalaai, magar ye nahin kehete hai ki jo 6 kisaan mare hai wo police kii goli se mare hai
 Till Tuesday, the Home Minister kept saying that there is no agitation on behalf of farmers anywhere in Madhya Pradesh except in two districts
 buudhvaar ko aiji kah rahe hai ki dilli se siarpief kii das companiyaan maangi gai hai
 If the Home Minister believed, the Prime Minister would not discuss the status of farmers in Delhi, nor did Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh cancel the scheduled press conference
 vaise, krishi mantri swatchta pakhwada par press conference karne vaale the, kisaan andolan par nahin
 On Wednesday, incidents of violence have taken place at several places in Indore, Ujjain, Dewas
 kai jagahon par karfu laga or mobile internet seva band kar di gai
 Therefore, pictures or videos are not coming from many places
 kahin bas jala di gai he to kahin dukaanon ko todaa gaya he
 After the death of 6 farmers in Mandsaur, the farmers pushed with the District Magistrate
 un par hamalaa kiya
 Damage to the tracks on the ratlam-neemuch line, the train stopped on the ratlam-neemuch route where it is
 devas main gussaye logon ne hatpiplya thane ke saamne pradarshan kiya or thana parisar main rakhi gadiyon main aag laga di
 In Sonkutch, protesters vented their anger on a chartered bus, stoning it
 
 
 is dauraan kai yatri apni jaan bachaane ke liye bhaage or kuch bas main hi fanse rahe
 
 
 Later, the bus was evacuated and the protesters also set fire to it
 
 
 pradarshan chal rahe hai magar internet band he
 The peasant movement should take care that there should not be violent demonstrations
 isse muddon se dhyaan hat jaataa he
 The emphasis is on restoring peace, and taking advantage of this, their leaders take a photo with the Chief Minister, the Minister and announce the end of the movement
 rajya main kai jagahon par internet band he phir bhi mukhyamantri twit kar rahe hai
 He has said that he is a farmer himself and understands his problems
 aapaki sari baton par sarkaar amal karegi
 By the way, the Madhya Pradesh cabinet has taken some decisions
 
 
 -fasalon kii bikri or dar tay karne ke liye ayog Buying price of Rs
5,050 quintal for pulses -5,025 rupee quintal mung daal kaa kareed mulya Purchase of Urad from June 20, payment to farmers immediately -nagdi ke liye bank-vitt mantralay se baat -rank as much as possible, cash and balance amount -nagdi rahi to nagad bhugtan bhi You must have noticed that there is a strong emphasis on cash in this decision
 kya notebandi ke kaaran kisaanon ke paas nagdi kam hone ke kaaran bhi yah sthiti paidaa hui he
 Would it have been a coincidence that on Wednesday morning, the front page of the newspapers in Delhi reported the deaths of six farmers
 inhen akhabaaron ke bheetar krishi or kisaan kalyaan mantralay ke do-do panne ke vigyaapan chape mili
 Just asking
 is vigyaapan ko padhakar laga ki kheti ke kshetra main sarkaar kii itani uplabdhiyaan hai ki do panne se kam main unki ginati nahin ho sakati
 If all the farmers of the country had read this advertisement, they would have left the protest and celebrated today
 maine donon panne kaa gyaapan anderline karke padhaa he
 It was resolved to double farmers' income by 2022
 krishi shiksha kaa bajet 47 fisadi se adhik kiya gaya he
 It is interesting to see this advertisement in the context of the decision of the Madhya Pradesh cabinet
 pataa chalata he ki kisaan kuch or maang rahe hai or sarkaar kuch or de rahi he
 In this advertisement there is a complete write-up on the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, how a large number of farmers have started taking insurance cover
 beemaa lene se kya beemaa mil jaataa he
 In the Rajya Sabha on 7 April this year, the Minister of State for Agriculture, in response to Kapil Sibal's question, said that in the 2016 kharif season i
e
 paddy season, farmers had claimed insurance of 4, 270 crore, but they got only 714 crore
 ye 7 april 2017 tak kaa data he
 You can understand that it is easy to buy insurance cover, it is not easy to get insurance
 yahi kaaran he vigyaapan main kuch he, sadakon par kuch he
 You can check these answers by visiting the Rajya Sabha website
 2014 main bijepi ne vaada kiya tha ki satta main aane par laagat main pachaas fisadi munafa jodakar mulya denge
 The government said in the Supreme Court that it cannot be given
 28 may ko bijepi adhyaksh amit shah is sandarbh main do baaten kehete hai
 The first is that no government can implement the Swaminathan formula by adding land cost to the cost
 phir ve apana hisaab lagaate hai
 The cost price reduces the cost of land and says that the government has given a minimum support price of 43 per cent more than the cost
 ye sabhi fasalon ke bare main kah rahe hai yaa kisi ek fasal ke bare main saaf nahin he, magar 43 fisadi zyaada daam kii baat ko media ne hedline ke taur par chapa tha
 In prime time on Tuesday itself, Devinder Sharma said that if this had happened, the government would have been claiming every advertisement and press conference
 hamane is do panne ke vigyaapan main bahut khoja, jiskaa daawa amit shah ne 28 may ko kiya tha
 You won't believe that there is no mention of a minimum support price in a two-page ad
 to kya jo baat amit shah ko pataa he, krishi or kisaan kalyaan mantralay ko pataa nahin he
 The comments vaise 2006 main em
 S
 Swaminathan had suggested this as chairman of the National Commission for Farmers
 aisa nahin he ki sarkaar em
 s has forgotten Swaminathan
 isi 19 may ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne em
 a book of S
 Swaminathan was released
 is maukey par pradhanmantri ne kaha ki dow
 Swaminathan's specialty is that his work is based on practical realities
 amit shah kehete hai ki zamin kii laagat jodakar koi sarkaar laagat kaa pachaas fisadi daam de hi nahin sakati
 All farmers do not get minimum support price by giving minimum support price
 isi maheene dilli main krishi vaigyanikon ke bich bharat ke mukhya aarthik salaahkaar arvind subramanyan ne kaha ki sarkaar ne nunatam samarthan mulya par dalhan kharidne kii puri koshish kii
 Even after this, 60 percent of the farmers had to sell pulses below the minimum support price
 puri koshish karne ke baad bhi sarkaar 40 pratishat kisaanon ko nunatam samarthan mulya de saki
 This is to say that the Chief Economic Advisor of India
 1,600 rupaya maheenaa kamata he bharat kaa kisaan
 Three farmers committed suicide in Maharashtra on Tuesday and Wednesday
 mangalvaar tak grahamantri kehete rahe ki madhyapradesh main do zilon ko chhodkar kahin par kisaanon kii taraf se koi andolan nahin he
