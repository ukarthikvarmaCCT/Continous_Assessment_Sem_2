 lihaaja koi raajnneetik dal yadi elactoral bond ko 15 din ke baad jamaa karaati he to use avaidh maanate hue koi bhugtan nahin kiya jayega
 At the same time, the special thing about the scheme is that the day a political party presents the electoral bond in front of the bank under its bank account, the payment will be made on the same day

 is par chif justise ne kaha ki agar ham aapke tark ko maane, to kya ham spikar ko koi aadesh de sakate hai? yaa phir aap bataaie ki ham kya order paas karen
 When asked by the Chief Justice, Mukul Rohatgi replied that you can ask the speaker to decide on a disqualification within a set time frame
 isse pehle chif justise ne kaha tha ki supreme court kaa kaam spikar ke kaamkaaj main dakhal dene kaa nahin he
 The court will not decide how the speaker should act
 haalanki, is maamle main jo sanvaidhanik masale hai us par ham kuch kah sakate hai
 Mukul Rohatgi, who was speaking on behalf of the rebel mlas, consistently asked before the court to accept the resignation of the mlas
 or kai tark bhi rakhe
 - Mukul Rohatgi explained some decisions of Kerala, Goa, Tamil Nadu High Court
 jisamen spikar ko pehle istife par vichaar karne ko kaha gaya he or ayogy ke liye faisle ko baad main
 He said that the Kerala court had said to accept the resignation immediately
 - supreme court ke dwaara aadhi raat ko karnataka vidhansabha main agle din floor test karwaane kaa order jari kar diya gaya tha
 - Mukul Rohatgi said that if a person does not want to be an MLA, no one can force them
 vidhayakon ne istipha dene kaa faisla kiya or waapas janata ke bich jane kii thaanee he
 Disqualification would be against this will

 Kamal Nath Bharatiya Janata Party, surrounded by the Congress ad on birthday, sworn in on a newspaper advertisement Kamal Nath, who became the chief minister due to Digvijay Singh, is celebrating his birthday on Monday
 apane netaa or pradesh ke mukhiya ke janmdin par madhya pradesh congress ne pradesh ke pramukh akhabaaron main mukhyamantri kamalnath ke bare main bataate hue vigyaapan chhapavaaye hai
 Now a controversy has arisen over this advertisement
 darasal, vigyaapan main kamalnath ke saansad se mukhyamantri banane tak ke safar ko bataaya gaya he lekin isamen do aisi baaten bhi likhi gai hai jise padhane ke baad yahi lag rahaa he ki kahin ye vigyaapan kamalnath ke rutabe ko kam aankane ke liye to nahin chhapavaaye gaye hai?darasal, congress dwaara jari kiye gaye is vigyaapan main kamalnath kii 1996 main hui haar kaa zikr to he hi, vahiin ye bhi bataaya gaya he ki kamalnath agar mukhyamantri bane hai to purv siem digvijay singh ke samarthan kii vajah se
 What is written in the advertisement? In the Congress advertisement it is written that 'kamal Nath is a patient leader
 prashasnic or prabandhan kshamta ke saath hi virodhiyon ko saadhane kii kshamta ne unhen madhya pradesh kaa mukhyamantri banavaa diya he
 It has been told in the advertisement that 'kamal Nath has also been a Lok Sabha MP 9 times
 'haalanki vigyaapan main kamalnath kii tarif ke bich main jahaan jaakar nazar atak jaati he or jise lekar vivaad khadaa ho rahaa he wo he kamalnath kii haar kaa zikr
 The advertisement further states that 'kamal Nath had also suffered defeat in 1996 from Chhindwara
 us samay unhen sunderlaal patwa ne chunaav maidan main patkhni di thi
 "now the question is, how can Congress use a word like Patkhani for its eldest leader? At the end of the advertisement it is written that in 1993, there was talk of Kamal Nath becoming the Chief Minister
" bataaya jaataa he ki tab arjuna singh ne digvijay singh kaa naam aage kar diya
 In this way Kamal Nath had missed becoming CM at that time
 ab 25 saal baad digvijay ke samarthan ke baad unhen mukhyamantri banane kaa mauka mila he
 'from this line it looks as if Kamal Nath has become CM not because of his ability but because of Digvijay Singh
 bijepi ne lee chutakicongress dwaara mukhyamantri kamalnath ke liye janmdin par chhapavaaye gaye vigyaapan par bijepi ne chutki lee he
 State BJP Vice President Rameshwar Sharma has said that in the advertisement issued by the Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee on the occasion of the birthday of Chief Minister Shri Kamal Nath, it has been made clear that Digvijay Singh's younger brother MLA Laxman Singh had said that Chief Minister Kamal Nath Jeemezbut Not a forced chief minister
 us par apni mohar laga di he
 He said that in this advertisement, Congress leaders have told Kamal Nath that you are the chief minister not because of the Chhindwara model but because of Rajaji
 raja ji ke bina is sarkaar kaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 As and when, Raja (digvijay) has done what he wished and will continue to do
 janmdin vaale din kamalnath ji ne apane hi netritv vaali congress se aise uphaar kii kalpana nahi kii hogi

 Offering the 'national Award for Best Electoral Practices' at a national function organized on 3rd National Voters' Day by the Election Commission, the Vice President said that six decades of experience teaches us that it should be analyzed properly
 isse pataa chalata he ki prayek naagarik jise mat dene kaa adhikari mila hua he, iskaa istemaal nahin karata or doosraa hamaare dwaara apanaai gai pranali main aksar vijeta kul daale gayi maton ke maton ke mukaable bahumat se kam mat hasil kar vijay praapt karata he

 chunaav ayog dwaara tisaren rashtriya matadaata diwas par yojit ek rashtriya samaaroh main 'sarveshreshth nirvachan kaary pranali ke liye rashtriya puraskaar' pradaan karte hue uparashtrapati ne kaha ki chah dashakon kaa anubhav hamen sikhaata he ki iskaa sahi tareeke se vishleshan kiya janaa chahie
 This shows that every citizen who has the right to vote does not use it, and in the system we adopt, the winner often wins by winning a majority of votes less than the total votes cast
 uparashtrapati ne kaha ki pehle bhi or haal ke varshon main loksabhaa ke nirvaachit adhiktar sadasyon ne apane-apane nirvachan kshetron main daale gayi kam maton ke aadhaar par chunaav jeeta

 Supertech Developers Is Developing Projects Projects Possession of half of the flats in North India's tallest residential building (north Eye) project has been in crisis
 noida ke sector 74 main sthit is project ko supertech developers viksit kar rahaa he
 Its construction is the responsibility of Mukesh Ambani's house, the company that makes Antilia, Bilimoria
 is project main kabhi ek flats 10 hajaar rupye prati varg feet tak bhi bechaa gaya lekin builder par karodon rupee ke bakaae ke kaaran is project par sankat ke badal mandaraane lage hai
 Apart from North Eye in Sector 74 of Noida, Superatak also has a Cape Town project
 is sector main kareeb saadhe 8 hajaar flats banaae ja rahe hai
 Half of these flats have been occupied and about 3300 flats have also been registered
 lekin builder par jameen kaa kareeb 293 karod rupye ab bhi bakaayaa he
 The authority allotted this land to Supertech in 2009-10
 lekin iske baad naa to developers ne jameen kii kishton ko chukaaya or naa hi athurity ne bakaayaa rakam kii vasuuli ke liye koshish kii
 Poor home buyers are now getting caught up in this mix of developer-authority
 darasal, amrapali maamle main supreme court kii fatkaar ke baad achaanak noida athurity ko projects se bakaayaa vasuuli kii yaad aane lagi he
 In this episode, Noida Authority has issued a recovery certificate i
e
 RC for recovery of land allocation of Sector 74 to Supertech
 iske pehle bhi 3-si, unitech samet kai developers ke khilaaf aarasi jari kii ja chuki he
 Noida Authority has so far issued rcs worth about 1600 crores but in this process, apart from following the law, not even one rupee has been recovered
 kya he aarasi kii kanoonee prakriya?darasal, aarasi ek kanoonee karrwai he jiske jari hone ke baad jila prashasan kii jimmemdari rakam vasuuli kii banati he
 Under this, the Tehsildar can lock the defaulter in lockup for 14 days
 bakaaedaar ke offis par taala lagaaya ja saktaa he yaa kabja kiya ja saktaa he
 In the case of the developer, the unsold flats can be locked and the dues can be recovered by selling them
 lekin isse projects ke bich main latak jane kaa khatra paidaa ho saktaa he, kyonki bakaaedaar ke faraar hone kaa dar bad jaataa he
 This creates an atmosphere of fear among home buyers
 yani jameen aavanton ke baad apni jimmedaari bhuulakar haath par haath rakhe baithi rahi athurity ab is tarah kii karrwai karne main lagi he jisase ghar kharidaaron ko nuksaan hone kii ashanka he
 The developer has already recovered all the money
 aarasi jari hone ke baad bhi develper ke paas hai court jane kaa vikalp maujuud he
 Noida Authority CEO Ritu Maheshwari said that they are issuing recovery certificates on projects in which they are not expected to recover dues
 vahiin supertech capatoun ke ghar kharidaar pi ke puri ne kaha ki noida athurity ke is recovery certificate ko jari karne se hamaare project ke rukne kaa khatra paidaa ho gaya he

 In Sunanda Pushkaramalay police have registered a case under section 302 of the IPC
 302 yani murder kaa maamla
 On Tuesday, as soon as Delhi Police Commissioner BS Bassi informed that Sunanda Pushkar was killed, there was panic all around
 murder, katl, hatya shabd kaa istemaal nahipulice kamishnar bassi mangalvaar ko khud hi ye bhi bol gaye ki doctor yaa police philhal yah nahin bataa paaegi ki jehar sunanda pushkar ne khud khai yaa use jabardastee khilaayaa gaya
 He has not clarified why Sunanda Pushkar's death case has been registered under Section 302 of the IPC
 kanoonee pench dur karne ke liye dhara 302 kaa sahaarajis jehar se sunanda kii maut hui us jehar kii maatra kitni thi or koun sa jehar tha, uski jaanch ke liye sample videsh bhejnaa he
 But till now the case was being investigated under 174
 174 ke tahat sample jaanch ke liye videsh nahin bhej sakate
 In order to remove this legal screw and send the sample abroad for investigation, the 302 shagufa has been released
 jehar ke bare main pataa chal jaae to cese sulajh jayega?agar visra videsh bhejne ke baad jehar kii sahi maatra bhi pataa chal jaae ki kitna jehar sunanda ke pet main yaa ragon main gaya to bhi isse cese kii tafteesh main kitna phayda hoga? kya mahaj jehar kii maatra bhar jaan lene se cese sulajh jayega? agar jehar ke maatra ke saath koun sa jehar sunanda ko diya gaya ye bhi pataa chal jae to bhi kya isse cese sulajh jayega? agar aisa hota to doctoron kii team ne apni report main chah jehar ke bare main bataaya tha
 what happened then? Anything found? Why did the case change to Section 302 of IPC instead of Section 174 of crpc? Under Section 174 of crpc, usually an action is taken only when death has occurred in mysterious condition
 yani maut kii vajah yaa makasad saaf naa ho
 The same action was going on in Sunanda's case till now
 ab police ne is maamle ko katl yani 302 maanakar tafteesh karne kaa faisla to kar liya, lekin ye katl kisne kiya, iskaa kisi ko nahin pataa
 That is why the FIR has been lodged against unknown people

 comtelephone: 91-11-4643 xxrep 4 4 garba aayojanon menmuslimentry na kar paaen, iske liye bhopal kii hindu utsav samiti ne prashasan se anurodh kiya he ki unhen aadhaar card aadhaarit entry karwaane kii ijaajat di jaae
 The Hindu Utsav Samiti alleges that the goal of most of the Muslim youth who reach Garba is to trap innocent girls in their courts
 aise main hindu utsav samiti kaa kahana he ki garba aayojanon main sirf hindu yuvakon kii entry ho
 According to the news of the Indian Express, in such a situation, the entire plan of Hindu Utsav Samitis is that the entry in Garba should be done by checking the Aadhaar card
 aadhaar card phek nahin ho sakatahindu utsav samiti ke adhyaksh kailash begvani kaa kahana he ki pahchaan ke liye istemaal hone vaale anya kagajaton ke mukaable nakliadharcard bananaa aasaan nahin he
 In such a situation, the identity of that person will be revealed on seeing the Aadhaar card
 begvani ne saaf kaha ki yah faisla muslim yuvakon ko garba se baahar rakhane ke liye kiya gaya he
 Promotion of Hinduism The Hindu Utsav Committee made this demand at a peace meeting of the district administration
 samiti kii is maang ko dekhte hue saaf kaha ja saktaa he ki tyohaar or sefti ke bahaane hindootv ko badhaava dene kii koshish ho rahi he
 The Hindu Utsav Samiti has around 6000 members
 samiti holi, diwali, ganesh puja jaise kaaryakramon kaa aayojan karti he par garba kii nahin
 Not only this, the committee also demanded the closure of meat and liquor shops during Ganeshotsav and Paryushan festival of Jainism
 avaidh tareeke se meet kharidne waalon ke khilaaf bhi kadi karwai kii jaae
 Complaint comes to exploitation The committee was told to the administration that it comes to complain about the exploitation of girls by people of other religions during and after garba events
 yahi vajah he ki unhone yah maang rakhi ki in aayojanon main duusare dharm ke logon khaskar muslim yuvakon ko dur rakhaa jaae
 The first threat was given to non-hindus in Gujarat in 2015 by the VHP warning that it would be better to stay away from Garba
 poster laga kar vishwa hindu parishad ne dhamkee di thi ki agar koi musalmaan ladkaa garba karte paaya gaya to uski 'ghar vaapasi' karwaai jaaegi
 Not only this, the organization also said that if the police stopped the program before 12 pm, the mike would be taken off from the mosque
 vishwa hindu parishad ne dhamkee di thi ki pandal main pahunche har musalmaan ko gomutra or gangaajal se hindu banaaya jayega
 The second day of the second edition of 'sahitya Aaj Tak' has ended its programs

 chhathvaan satr : cricket- loktantr banaam vanshavadasahitya ajtak ke chathe satr cricket- loktantr banaam vanshavaad main bharat ke purv cricketer kirti aaazaad ne shirkat kii
 The session was conducted by Rajdeep Sardesai and Shweta Singh
 is satr ke dauraan rajdeep ne kaha ki ab vanshavaad kaa daur khatm ho rahaa he
 In any field, now people are emerging who have no support and they have achieved their status by mere ability
 kirti aaazaad ne kaha, 'agar aapke andar kuch bada karne kii abhilaashaa he or drudh sankalp he, to aapako koi nahin roak saktaa he
 Rajdeep Sardesai gave the example of Virat Kohli MS Dhoni and Sachin Tendulkar, saying that the father of these three was not a cricketer
 lekin unke tallent or mehnat ne unhen is mukaam par pahunchaaya
 Fifth session: Kavi Sammelan: Kavi Sammelan was organized in the fifth session of Aaj Tak

 The session was conducted by Punya Prasun Vajpayee

 sanjay baru ne kaha ki 1991 main unki narsinha raav par likhi kitaab main kaha tha ki vah aarthik riform kii polytical leadership narsinha raav ne kii thi
 During his tenure, Manmohan Singh was given the rank of Finance Minister
 is satr ke dauraan kaha gaya ki aarthik sudhaar kii drushti se dekhen to desh ke sabase taqatvar pradhanmantri pivi narsinha raav the
 However, it was also held that Atal Bihari Vajpayee, during his tenure, increased his height from the RSS and established himself as a more vicious Prime Minister than Modi
 teesraa satr: en ansuteble beaysahitya ajtak ke duusare din ke tisare ahm satr en ansuteble bvoy main diarector, produsar or screenriter karan johar ne kiya
 This session was moderated by Anjana Om Kashyap
 is satr ke dauraan apni kitaab par baat karne se pehle karan ne film actress karina kapur or kaajol ke saath dosti or anban par apni baat kahi
 At the same time, Karan said that this happened to Shahrukh Khan with him
 haalanki karan ne kaha ki unke nijee rishte unki profeshnal life par kabhi asar nahin daalate or isiilie vah bhavishya main shahrukh ke saath kaam karne kaa mauka dekh rahe hai
 Karan said that he does not know how to make real films but he knows to sell dreams and that is why he seems to be saving dreams in his films
 vahiin is satr ke dauraan karan ne bataaya ki unhen apane sexual orientation ke vishay main jo kahana tha vah apni kitaab en ansuteble bvoy main likh chuke hai
 Karan said that every single word written on this subject in the book is correct
 karan ne kaha ki aaj kaa daur he ki nepotism ke bare main charchaa ho rahi he lekin yah har daur main rahaa
 Karan said that it is true that his father had the business of making films and probably that is why he is making films today
 karan ne kaha ki yah sirf film industry main hi nahin sabhi kshetron main dekhne ko miltaa he
 Karan said that whatever he inherited from his father, he definitely helped him, but after that, he has decided his place only by resorting to hard work
 doosraa satr: aaj kaa sahityasahitya ajtak ke duusare din ke duusare ahm satr aaj kaa sahitya main mashhool ashok vaajapeyi, upanyaaskaar alka saraavagi or lekhak or aalochak manager pandeya ne shirkat kii
 The session was conducted by Punya Prasun Vajpayee
 prasoon ne manager pandeya se bhartiya samaaj ke vishleshan par poocha ki samakaleen samaaj par kya vichaar he
 Manager Pandey said that even today there are people in the Indian society who try to create, create and innovate the literature of the past, knowing the art and music
 aaj samaaj main unheen ke kuch myne hai
 Manager Pandey said that society and literature move forward with the help of this relationship
 ashok vaajapeyi ne kaha ki sahitya koi samaaj nahin gadhata he
 Rather, literature is creating a person
 manager pandeya kii baat se ittefaq rakhte hue ashok ne kaha ki ab soshal media ke naam par ek vicitra vyavastha saamne ai he jahaan sirf ek duusare kii tarif hi hoti rahati he
 At the same time, the work of literature is not to decide but to tell what is the situation
 pehla satr: sahitya or samaajasahitya ajtak ke duusare din kii shuruyaat ahm satr sahitya or samaaj main kavi, geetkaar or lekhak javed akhtar ne kiya
 The session was conducted by Punya Prasun Vajpayee
 is satr kii shuruyaat main javed akhtar ne kaha ki aadmi ko apni shoharat or kamyaabi par ghamand nahin karnaa chahie
 Javed said that now the pace of communication has increased, technology and social media have emerged as a big medium
 lekin is raftaar kii dein he ki aaj gaharaai kam ho gai he
 However Javed said that the good thing today is that the new generation is searching for depth
 mughalon ke daur main hindustan sabase amir desh thajaved akhtar ne kaha ki 1999 main oparation vijay ke samay vah kargil, batalik, draas ke daure par gaye the
 During this, he narrated his tragedy
 javed se punya ne poocha ki aakhir kabhi-kai aapako rashtrawaad ke sawaal par gussa kyon aa jaataa he
 Javed said that nationalism is much bigger than both the political party and the leader
 yadi koi netaa soche ki vah desh se bada he to yah saki mugalata he
 Javed said that it is possible that i am not connected with the government but i am always connected with the country
 akbar road ke naam badale jane ke vidaad par javed akhtar ne kaha ki bina akbar ke desh kaa itihaas puraa nahin hota
 Akbar was a very big man
 aise samay main jab europe main secular ko samajha ja rahaa tha tab akbar aisa shahenshaah tha jo secularism ko practice kar rahaa tha
 Javed Akhtar said that Hindustan was the richest country in the world during the Mughal period
 film or itihaas main bhed rakhentammahal ke mudde par javed ne kaha ki tajmahal bhi misr ke pyramid kii tarah architekchar kaa ek vander he
 The architecture of Delhi bears the image of the Mughal period
 javed ne kaha ki islam main cheharaa banane haraam he lihaaja is daur main kala ke chhetra main mujeec or painting apane sheersh par pahunche
 Javed said that the film should not be mistaken for understanding history and history as a film
 javed akhtar ne india today magazine kii sahitya varshiki 'abhivyakti kaa utsav' kaa locarpan kiyajane pehle din kii jhalkinya'sahitya ajtak' ke duusare sanskaran ke duusare din kii shuruyaat sahitya jagat kii kuch or badi hastiyon ke saath
 Where the first day started with India Today Group Vice Chairperson Kali Puri's Welcome Speech
 kaarykram ke dauraan unhone kaha ki 'sahitya ajtak' hindi sahitya, sangeet or naatak parampara ko badhaava dene ke liye sahitya jagat ke sitaron kaa yah jamaavada ek prayaas he
 The first day of the program was attended by singers Anup Jalota and singer Talat Aziz along with Hans Raj Hans, Nilesh Mishra and many new poets
 inke alaava sensor board ke pramukh or geetkaar, kavi prasoon joshi ne bhi apni nai puraani kavitaaon se bhi mehfil main samaa baandha
 The first day ended with the notes of the famous Qawwal Nizami Brothers
 sahitya ajtak kii mehfil indira gandhi rashtriya kala centre ke angan main saji he, 12 november ko bhi kaarykram main kai badi hastiyaan shikarat karengi
 It is said that there are many secrets in the lives of women and girls
 unki jindagi rahasy kaa paryaay hoti hai
 It is impossible not to read what goes on in the minds of girls
 yani ladkiyaan apane purush saathi se kai baaten chhupaati hai
 It is not because she is afraid but because she is very attached to those things in her personal life
 soshal media par haal hi kiye gaye ek survey main mahilaon se poocha gaya ki aisi koun-si bate hai jo vah apane pati yaa phir bwoyfriend se chupaana chaahati hai
 This survey report has revealed such things, which women do not disclose to their partners at any cost
 apane afaire ke bare menapako lag saktaa he ki aapaki jindagi main maujuud mahila ko sabase achche anubhav aapke saath hi hue hai
 But maybe you are wrong, because what does she know that she is hiding those special experiences from you
 aisa isliye kyonki mahilaayein apni chhavi ko lekar kaaphi chaukanni rahati hai
 She does not want anyone to create her wrong image
 duusari vajah zyada vyavhaarik he
 Women and girls often hide their love affairs because they do not want their current partner to be uncomfortable with it
 aam taur par mardon kii dilchaspee ye jaanane main rahati he ki kya wo apni saathi ke eks se behatar hai, lekin khaas baat yah he ki mahilaon ko yah bilkul pasand nahin he
 You will never know how and what women talk to their friends
 basharte aap chhupakar unki baaten na sune
 The things women are nervous about sharing, they share with their friends with great fun
 na sirf apni balki wo apni dost kii raaj kii baton ko bhi apane pati yaa bwoyfriend se chupaane se bhi gurej nahin karti hai
 Make-up talks: Women do not like the fact that their husband or boyfriend is aware of their makeup secret
 jaahir taur par aisa isliye ki purush ye kabhi pataa nahin laga paaen ki apni sundarataa ko badhaane ke mahilaayein kya jatan karti hai
 X's Kissesicki has rightly said that woman exists by love
 aap ye to jaanate hi hai ki aapse pehle bhi uski jindagi rahi he
 And it is also natural that before you all your life will not be cut only among women
 lekin agar aap yah jaanane kii koshish kar rahe hai ki wo apane past ke bare main kya sochati hai to thodaa sanbhal jaaie
 Because women don't like to say something like that
 survey ke dauraan adhiktar mahilaon or ladakiyon ne bataaya ki wo apane eks se judi apni bhaawanaaon ko lekar kabhi sach nahin bolti hai
 Actually she does not want her present to be spoiled in the past affair
 jabaki iske bilkul ulat kuch mahilaon kaa kahana tha ki unhone jaan boojhkar apane eks kii baaten apane vartmaan saathi ke saath saajha kii taaki wo jaan saken ki unki ummid kaa graph kitna ooncha he
 Most of the women related to their family are very much aware of their family image in front of their husband or boyfriend
 apni bahan ko lekar, apni maa ko lekar yaa apane parivaar kii chhavi se judi har baat sikret rakhane main vah koi kasar nahin chhodti hai
 However, there is also a truth that women are usually the tongue of the tongue
 isi saal kuch vakt baad bharat kii nai raksha mantri 58 varshiya nirmala sitaraman se ek choti-si rasm nibhaane kii ummid kii ja sakati he
 They will have to fill the vermilion in their demand, fold their hands in prayer and smash the coconut of the omen on the steel wing of a 7,000 tonne ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) designed and built in India
 ve iskaa namakaran 'aridaman' (shatruon kaa sanhaarak) bhi karengi
 Naval traditions require that this puja be started at the hands of women and in recent years this role has been changed to the first women
 pichhali baar yah rasm purv pradhanmantri kii patni gursharan cor ne adaa kii thi, jab 2009 main unhone bharat kii pehali esasbn ienes arihant kaa udghaatan kiya tha
 Sitharaman's selection is not merely symbolic, but much more than that, as he is now part of the committee that leads one of India's most secretive strategic programs
 3 sitambar ke mantrimandal pherbadal main desh kii pehali purnakalik mahila raksha mantri ke taur par unki niyukti tajjub kii baat thi
 In fact, Arun Jaitley's pre-scheduled two-day visit to preside over the annual defense dialogue with his Japanese counterparts was confusing to the BJP that the Defense Ministry would continue to be with them
 raashtrapati bhawan main shapath lene ke baad dopaher 1 baje ke aasapaas, or pradhanmatri narendra modi ke air india van ke china ke liye udaye ke baad, sitaraman ko cabinet secretary pi

 When she reached there, her political guide Jaitley first told her this news — she is going to become the country's first full-time woman defense minister
 phir jetali kii japan yatra kaa mudda tha, jiskaa kaarykram kai maheene pehle bana tha
 Sitamaran could hold the position of Defense Minister and could go to Tokyo the same evening or let Jaitley go to Tokyo as per schedule
 sitaraman ko koi utaavali nahin thi or unhone nae ohade kaa kaam sanbhaalane ke liye or chaar din intjaar karne kaa vikalp chunaa
 His rise to this height is the highest jump in any shock of any cabinet minister during the three-year tenure of this NDA government
 sena ke afasar kehete hai ki isane ''brigadier se lekar theth army commander tak'' kaamon kii vyavastha ko hilaakar rakh diya he
 The government is now considering a reshuffle in the rules of functioning so that Sitharaman, as the defense minister, does not rest on his larger colleagues in the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), Jaitley and Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj
 yah niyukti aise vakt hui he jab behad dakiyanoosee sainya bal ladaaiyon main auraton kii bhoomika par nae sire se vichaar kar rahe hai—ieef ne pichley saal teen mahila ladaaku payalton ko liya he or is saal sena ne mahila javaanon ko (abhi tak ve bataur afasar hi kaam karti thim) bhartee karne kaa faisla liya he
 The appointment of a full-time defense minister within the military forces is relieved — Jaitley was holding the responsibility of this important ministry as an additional charge for two years in two terms
 raahat kii jagah jaldi hi ummiido kaa boj asana jamaa legaa, jab sitaraman south block ke cameraa number 104 main kadam rakhengi or unki mej par adhure kaamon kaa ambara laga hoga
 Making in India Sitaraman's rise to this high rank coincides with the Prime Minister's message of 'kama karo ya rasta napo'
 is sarkaar ke liye ab do saal se bhi kam vakt bachaa he, aise main raksha mantralay ko saaf taur par phiseddi mana ja rahaa tha jisane apane behad ahm 'mek in india' ke vaade ko puraa karke nahin dikhaaya he
 The bjp's 2014 manifesto saw the massive $ 250 billion purchase of military forces as a possibility to turn indigenous manufacturing into a jolt
 raksha kshetra main epadi ke aankade is march main jab sansad main rakhe gaye the, tab south block main raksha mantralay ke afasarshah shaayad apni mejon ke neeche chhip gaye honge—raksha kshetra main mahaj 61,000 ru

 64 saamaanon kii epadi kii fehrist main yah ankada 61veen paaydaan par he—jute ke liye jo mila usase upar or 'mathematical survey tathaa drawing aujaaron' ke liye mili rakam se neeche
 One of the reasons for foreign equipment vendors not being interested is the bureaucracy in the ministry
 ranneetik bhagidaari ke ek prastaav ko, jisamen nijee kshetra videshi vikritaon ke saath milakar desh main hi yudhpot, ladaaku vimaan or yuddh tanks banayega, is saal may main raksha mantri arun jetali ne jaldbaaji main manjuuri di thi
 The approval was given two years after his predecessor Manohar Parrikar proposed the proposal
 is niti ko anjaam tak pahunchane ke asar kai staron par ho sakate the—raksha kshetra main epadi kaa aana badhata, raksha udyog ko badhaava miltaa or sainya balon kii raksha taiyaariyon main ijapha hota
 Meanwhile, critics are pointing fingers at Sitharaman's mixed tenure in the commerce ministry
 kaarobaar karne main aasaani par vishwa bank ke survey main pichley saal bharat kii rekking mahaj ek paaydaan ke ijaphe ke saath 130 ho gai
 Export growth 4

 But the real Gamechanger Government's General Financial Rules (GFR) could have been changed under his leadership
 ye ve niyam hai jinase saarvajanik vitt ke tamaam maamle tay kiye jate hai
 After these amendments to the GFR, it was made mandatory for the government to procure from the private sector (with at least 50 per cent of local equipment) and was widely hailed by the Indian industry

 Three years before that, in 2003, Swaraj, impressed by Sitharaman's speech style and stubborn resolve to pursue and achieve her goal, included her as one of the youngest members of the National Commission for Women (NCW)

 Like Ramvriksha Yadav, the villain of the Mathura incident in UP, a man named Ram Avadh Yadav in Pratapgarh district calls himself an avatar of God
 vah apana naam baba balak nath bhagwaan bataata he
 Hundreds of bighas in the name of the ashram, along with capturing land, runs an illegal black business
 khud ko upi sarkaar ke cabinet mantri shivpal yadav kaa kareebi bataane vaala yah baba ilaake ke logon ko pareshaan kar rakhaa he
 Its effect is that even the police are afraid to lay hands
 jaankaree ke mutabik, mathura main jawahar baag main jis tarah ram avadh yadav ne jameen par kabja kiya hua tha
 Similarly, Ram Awadh Yadav would mark people's fields at night in Dilippur village under Kandhai Kotwali in Pratapgarh district
 subah uske bhakt us par medbandi karke kabja kar lete
 On protesting, the villagers would have made a fake case
 jaanwaron ko khulaa chhodkar kheti nasht karvaa detaa
 Fearing this, villagers consider it more appropriate to lay fallow than to sow crops in their fields

 Baba was also accused of abducting and raping a soldier's girl a few years ago

 Baba is special to the Cabinet Minister! According to the people, this Baba describes himself as close to the Cabinet Minister Shivpal Yadav
 isane ashram par kai rasukhdaar mantri, netaa or prashasnic adhikariyon kaa shilapat bhi lagava rakhaa he
 It is said that once the cabinet minister Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya's father became ill
 unka ilaaj kiya gaya, lekin vah thik nahin ho rahe the
 At that time he was cured by the grace of Lord Balak Nath
 tab unhone is baba ko ek car uphaar main di thi
 The police are also afraid of its influence
 baba ne khud ko bataaya nirdoupane upar lage aaropon par baba ne kaha ki vah devarahaa baba ke shishy he
 Is a worshiper of Lord Krishna
 gaay or garib kii seva karte hai
 Some chaotic elements disturb them
 unke kai shishyon kii hatya ho chuki he
 He informed the police several times, but no action was taken
 unako upar jo bhi aarope lage hai, unase wo bari ho chuke hai
 Even in the investigation of CBCID, he has been acquitted
 unke kuch virdohi log unke khilaaf sajeesh rach rahe hai
 SP ordered the inquiry, SP Madhav Prasad Verma said that the villagers have given many applications against Ram Awadh Yadav alias Baba Balak Nath Bhagwan
 vahiin baba ne bhi graminon ke dwaara pareshaan karne kii shikaayat darj karai he
 The police team is taking stock of the occasion

 shatrughna sinha (shatrughan Sinha News) bhi pichley do baar se patna sahib kii seat (patna Sahib Lok Sabha Seat) bataur bijepi ummidavaar ke taur par jitate aae hai, magar yah bhi sachai he ki parisemen ke pehle argedy ke ramkripal yadav (ram Kripal Yadav) ne patna kii yah seat 2004 main jiti thi
 Later, two Lok Sabha seats were formed named Patna Sahib and Patliputra Lok Sabha Seat
 patna sahib main jahaan shatrughna sinha or ravishankar ke bich muqabla he, vahiin patliputra main argedy kii misa bharti or bijepi ke ramkripal yadav ke bich kadi takkar he
 Let's talk about Patna Sahib first
 parisemen ke baad patna sahib main kysth vot hi nirnaayak hai or is baar do kysth maidan main hai or ek tisare kysth netaa bhi hai jo parade ke peeche se is chunaav main asar daal rahe hai
 Yes, i am referring to Rajya Sabha MP RK Sinha
 unhone apni sampatti 800 karod kii ghoshit kii he or ve apane bete ke liye tikat chaahate the
 This is the reason that when Ravi Shankar Prasad reached Patna with a Lok Sabha ticket, then the supporters of RK Sinha and Ravi Shankar Prasad were confronted at the airport itself
 magar sachai yah he ki patna sahib ke 6 main se 5 vidhansabha par bijepi kaa kabja he or fatuha kii ek seat argedy ke paas he
 In 2009, BJP got 57 percent votes in Patna Sahib and 55 percent in 2014
 magar is baar do kysth netaaon ke bich takkar he or matadaata bante hue hai
 People are assuming that both are air leaders
 jaise shatrughan sinha nahin aate the, vahi haal ravishankar prasad kaa bhi hoga
 People also say that Ravi Shankar Prasad was in the Rajya Sabha all his life
 pichhlaa chunaav unhone 45 saal pehle ladaa tha wo bhi patna vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr sangh kaa
 At that time Lalu Yadav won the post of president and Sushil Modi and Ravi Shankar Prasad were successful in winning other positions
 tab se lekar abhi tak unhone koi chunaav nahin ladaa he
 Not even the local body
 patna sahib ke kysth matadaata thode kanfayuj hai, kyonki log yah kah rahe hai ki donon to kysth hai or ravishankar prasad to pehle se hi rajyasabha main hai or unka turm abhi 5 saal ke liye bachaa hua he
 In such a situation, defeating a Kayastha i
e
 Shatrughan Sinha would mean a lack of a Kayastha MP
 tark chaahe jo bhi ho shatrughna sinha ho maslim yadav or congress voton kaa bharosa he
 Together they earned the star power of Bihari Babu
 unhen lagata he ki agar unhone kysth vot main send laga di to baat ban sakati he
 At the same time, Ravi Shankar Prasad has faith in Prime Minister Modi as well as the party organization, as it is a traditional seat of BJP
 faisla jo bhi aae magar muqabla tagada he

 Amla said, 'how was Mohali's pitch

 Angered by the Modi government's cabinet expansion at the Center, the Shiv Sena announced in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly that they would sit in the opposition
 jabaki kuch din pehle uddhav thakare rajya sarkaar main dasiyon vibhaag se lekar upmukhyamantri tak kii kursi par bhi tol-mol kar rahe the
 Uddhav has not always been like this, sometimes he does not
 na hi unhen in chunaavon kii haar ne aisa banaaya he
 The real reason for his attitude is known to us through sources
 darasal is chunaav kii bhagdaud main kisi roj aravind kejariwal kaa nakhun unhen lag gaya tha
 Since then Uddhav has started taking a U-turn with his words
 haalanki har koi puch rahaa he ki dilli se arvind chupchaap maharashtra kaise pahunche jo unke nakhun ne khel kar diya
 It is surprising
 lekin usase bhi zyada hairaan kar dene vaali baat ye saamne aa rahi he ki bhaajapa kaa saath chhootane ke baad shivasena kaa ‘rashtravaadi’ tamgaa chhina ja saktaa he
 The Shiv Sena MLA arrived in Maharashtra Sadan yesterday wearing an orange safa and everyone knows what 'orange' and 'nagpur' are concerned with
 bhagave ke missuj kii baat bhaajapa ke saath nagpur waalon ko bhi khatak gai he
 That is why, with immediate effect, there was talk of taking away the license of 'hindutva' along with 'nationalism'

 That is why India has warmly welcomed the historic summit of US President Donald Trump and North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un in Sentosa, Singapore
 bharat pehle se hi trump or kim kii mulaakaat par baariki se najar banaae hue tha
 Over the past few years there has been a close escalation between North Korea and Pakistan, which may now be over
 isaki vajah yah he ki abhi tak sanyukt raashtra or america ke pratibandh ke chalate koi desh uttar korea se sambandh nahin rakh rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, Pakistan secretly kept close with North Korea
 bharat lagataaruttar koreaor pakistan ke bich gathjod kaa maamla uthaata rahaa he
 In the United Nations General Assembly, India had said that Pakistan had secretly transferred nuclear technology to North Korea
 darasal, america or sanyukt raashtra ke pratibandh ke chalate uttar korea kaaphi samay se alag-thalag padaa tha, jiskaa phayda pakistan uthaa rahaa tha
 He wanted North Korea to stand against India
 uttar korea ke parmaanu kaarykram sirf america hi nahin, balki bharat samet duniya bhar ke liye chintaa kaa sabab ban gaye the
 So India wanted North Korea to end its nuclear program and the same happened at the summit
 jab trump or kim kii mulaakaat kii taarikh tay ho gai, to bharat fouran harakat main aayaa or kendriya videsh rajya mantri wike singh ne uttar korea kaa daura kiya
 During this time, the North Koreans assured that they would not allow any activity that threatens the security of India
 isse bharat kii chintaa kaaphi had kam hui he
 Although international sanctions will remain in force on North Korea, it is expected that global and US sanctions against North Korea will be lifted
 isse bharat ke liye uttar korea ke rup main ek ubharta hua bazaar mil jayega, jisase pradhanmantri narendra modi kii act east policy ko dhar dene main madad milegi
 At the same time, China's challenge in the North Korea market will increase
 abhi tak uttar korea antarrashtriya pratibandhon kii vajah se alag-thalag padaa tha, jiske chalate vahaan ke bazaar main china kaa ecchhatra raaj tha
 In this way, while friendship between America and North Korea will create opportunities for India, on the other hand, China will be worried

 It may sound strange, but researchers at Oklahoma University claim that people who watch porn more than once a week also become more religious
 aisa porn dekhne se jude unke aparadhbodh kii vajah se hota he
 The guilt of watching porn makes you more concerned with the sociology and religious professors of the University of Religion, and Samuel Perry, who is leading the research team, said watching too much can increase obsessiveness
 aisa tab jarur hota he jab vah apni dharmik manyataon ko todta he
 Those who never watch porn are more balanced, Perry, in his study published in the research paper Journal of Sex Research, says that those who have never seen porn are more balanced
 unhen apni dharmikata par koi andeh nahin hota he
 Researchers found shocking facts during the question-and-answer with 1,314 youth from 2006 to 2012

 Less religious viewing of occasional porn reveals the facts revealed after their analysis that people watching porn more than once a week have a strong trust in religious beliefs
 vahiin jo kabhi-kabhaar aise video dekhte hai unka dharmik manyataon par bharosa kam hota he
 The more religious watching porn, the more religious peri said that those who watch more porn seem to be more religious
 ve zyada prarthana yaa puja karte hai
 On the other hand, those who watch porn occasionally do worship and pray only occasionally
 2006 main jinhone har hafte porn dekha ve 2012 aate-aate zyada dharmik ho gaye
 They started praying and worshiping more
 prarthana main kam shaamil hue kam porn dekhne vaaledusri taraf jo maheene main porn dekhte the, unki dharmikata main koi badhotaree nahin hui
 This result is shocking because it was said that people who practice religious discipline overcome addiction like porn
 saamaanya rup se jinhone porn ek maheene main ekaadh baar dekha he ve kam dharmik hote hai
 Such people are less involved in prayer and worship
 porn ko galat maanate hai dharmik logdow peri ne kaha, dharmik americans porn ko sexual naitikta main galat maanate hai
 When they constantly watch porn, they feel that something is going wrong
 aise main ve puja or prarthana kaa sahaara lete hai

 The Chief Minister of Delhi announced the opening of the doors of government offices to the common people from June 1, but on June 1, people kept wandering from one to the other with their grievances
 khaastaur par sarkaar ke headquarter yani sachivalay main to sarkari staff hi is aadesh se anjaan dikhaa
 People who came to the Secretariat with their complaints could not meet the officers, because neither their time was fixed nor the officers were ready to meet the common people
 siem arvind kejariwal ne akhabaaron main ishtaharon ke zarie ye kaha kaha tha ki ek june se somvaar se shuukravaar tak har varking de par subah 10 se 11 baje tak sabhi sarkaar daftaron ke daravaaje aam logon ke liye khule rahen
 From officers to ministers and chief ministers, all will meet ordinary people without any prior appointment and listen to their problems
 akhabaaron main ishtahaar to aa gaye, lekin jin afasaron ko logon se milanaa tha or jis sarkari mulajimon ko ye sunishchit karnaa tha ki daftar ke dar par aam janata ko afasaron tak pahunchane main koi dikkat na ho, vahi raah kaa roda ban gaye
 According to them, they have no government order other than newsletter, which states that the entry of common people in the secretariat will be done without any appointment
 sachivalay main jab hamaari team pahunchi, to yahaan aam dinon kii tarah hi vyavastha lagu thi, yani jise sachivalay ke bheetar kisi afasar yaa mantri se milanaa he, to use appointment lenaa hoga
 The employee sitting at the reception will have to talk to the staff in the officer's office and after this, the formalities of making the pass will have to be completed, the purpose of visiting will be given
 iske baad agar afasar milanaa chahega, to hi milane vaala sachivalay ke andar ja paaegaa
 Although the people associated with the secretariat administration argued that the common people do not have to come to the secretariat with their complaints, because they can lodge these complaints in their local offices, but the plea does not go up, because there is no such condition in the Calibration was laid

 Former Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar could not have chosen a better day to announce his withdrawal intentions
 10 aktubar ko patna main purv raashtrapati ve
 V
 giri kii 120veen saalagirah par yojit ek kaarykram main unhone farmaaya ki ve jimmedaari se bhaag nahin rahe
 He said, "we are ready to work
" " giri ne 1969 kaa raashtrapati chunaav na sirf nirdaleey ladaa, balki congress ke aadhikarik ummidavaar neelam sanjeev reddy ko haraa itihaas rach diya tha
 Bilashak Giri is an inspiration to anyone who is looking forward to a comeback
 aakhir 1969 main shikhar par vaapasi karne vaale giri ko bhi 1954 main nehru mantrimandal se hatana padaa tha
 But there is an irony with it
 yah kaarykram giri kii vaastavik janmatithi se thik do maah baad yojit hua
 Similarly, Nitish may have delayed his announcement of his wish to return
 argedy or congress ke saath mahagathbandhan banaae unhen do maah se zyada samay ho chukaa he
 This alliance has certainly strengthened his electoral position, but it has weakened his personal status
 ve mahagathbandhan ko apane ishaaron par us tarah nahin chalaa sakate, jaise apni party ko chalaate aae hai
 When Nitish said that 'we are not running away from this', his party naturally created a stir
 lekin teen din ke bheetar hi mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ke bayaan ne isaki hawa nikaal di
 Speaking to the media after the Janata Darbar on October 13, Manjhi said that the grand alliance of JD (U), RJD and Congress would collectively decide who should be the chief minister after the 2015 assembly elections
 isse rajnatik halkon main mana gaya ki maanjhi yah maanane se inkaar kar rahe hai ki nitish mukhyamantri pad ke liye mahagathbandhan kii swaabhaavik pasand honge
 Raising political temperature Manjhi said, "no party can decide the chief ministerial candidate alone
 " unka bayaan aise vakt par aayaa jab haal hi main argedy ke upaadhyaksh raghuvansh prasad singh ne bhi aisi hi baat kahi thi, ''mukhyamantri kaa faisla jedy (you) akele nahin kar saktaa
 "state politics has gained momentum with this rhetoric
 may main jab nitish ne mukhyamantri pad ke liye maanjhi kaa chayan kiya tha, tab maano har koi patakatha ke hisaab se bhoomika nibhaa rahaa tha
 Manjhi was considered obedient and a puppet
 maanjhi ne bhi usee tarah bagaiyr naa-nukur kiye nitish kii pasand ke logon ko apane mantrimandal main jagah di or kubul kiya ki nitish hi unke supreme leader hai
 So the perception has become that he is just a caretaker Chief Minister for a short time
 lekin pichley ek maah main maanjhi ne apane louh iraadon kii jhlak deni shuru kar di he
 After the accident of Dussehra, he issued the order for the suspension of the Medical Superintendent of Patna Medical College and Hospital and the transfer of four senior doctors, along with the removal of IAS and IPS officers of Patna
 unhone dawa kharid ghotaale main chikitsa vibhaag ke aaropee 10 adhikariyon ko bhi nilambit kar diya
 With these decisions, they showed that they are strict administrators
 is tarah ve nirnaayak netaa ke taur par ubhare
 There is a discussion that he also refused to implement some of Nitish's decisions
 saaf he, maanjhi ab apni takat or adhikaar jataa rahe hai
 They have understood that Nitish and JD (U) cannot sideline them because doing so will upset Mahadalit supporters and no one can afford to ignore their numbers
 apane paanch maah ke kaarykaal main maanjhi na sirf nitish se naakhush jedy(you) netaaon ke centrebindu ban gaye hai, balki mahagathbandhan ke dalon ke bich asardaar jod banakar bhi ubhare hai
 They are also said to be in constant touch with RJD chief Lalu Prasad
 jaahir he, unhone yah sunishchit kar liya he ki agar unhen satta ke shikhar se bedakhal karne kii koshish hoti he to isaki acchhee-khaasi rajnatik keemat chukaani pad sakati he
 On one hand, Nitish's attempt to return at this juncture may put a question mark on his commitment to stop communal forces
 yah poocha jayega ki unke liye kya mukhyamantri kii kursi patibaddhta se badhkar he
 The top sources of JD (U) and RJD agree that the key to Nitish's re-statehood may be in Lalu's hand
 nitish kii tatkaal vaapasi ke liye lalu sambhavat: raji na hon kyonki is vakt unhen mukhyamantri ke taur par sweekaar karne kaa matlab hoga 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke liye mahagathbandhan kii kaman unke haathon main dena
 Lalu does not want the power to be in the hands of Nitish again
 243 sadasyon kii vidhansabha main jedy(you) sarkaar ko bane rahane ke liye argedy ke 24 sadasyon kaa samarthan behad mahatvapurn he
 The JD (U) has 118 mlas, five less than the general majority
 argedy kaa samarthan is saamaanya guna-bhaag se kahin zyada jaruri he, khaskar tab jab rajyasabha ke chunaav main jedy(you) ke 20 se zyada vidhayakon ne party ke aadhikarik ummidavaaron ke khilaaf vot diya ho
 However, a section of the JD (U) is strongly pushing for Nitish's return against Manjhi by raising criticism and disagreements
 lekin lagata nahin ki isse nitish ko koi madad milegi
 However, Nitish has taken command of the party affairs
 ve party kaaryakartaaon kaa netritv bhi kar rahe hai
 But JD (U) insiders themselves admit that it is only Lalu who can let Nitish become the Chief Minister before or after the 2015 assembly elections
 jedy(you) netaaon kaa ek dhada lalu ko yah samajhane kii koshish kar rahaa he ki mahagathbandhan ko vidhansabha chunaav nitish ke netritv main laduya chahie
 But RJD leaders do not agree with this
 ve jawaab main daawa karte hai ki gathbandhan kaa netritv argedy ke haathon main hona chahie kyonki loksabhaa chunaav or vidhansabha upachunaav main argedy ko kahin zyada vot mili hai
 This is not the only issue of leadership on which there are differences between RJD and JD (U) leaders
 kai duusare muddon par bhi donon main sarvanumati nahin he
 That is why the issue of RJD and Congress joining Manjhi's cabinet is also getting postponed
 haalanki abhi is vichaar ko puri tarah dafnaaya nahin gaya he
 Mutual opposition also has its roots in the confrontation of personalities
 nitish ne loksabhaa chunaav main party kii haar kii jimmedaari sweekaar karte hue mukhyamantri pad se istipha diya tha
 Hence, he naturally sits on a more 'high moral ground' to lead the fight against the BJP
 duusari ore loksabhaa chunaav main argedy ne 22 fisadi vot hasil kiye the jabaki jedy(you) ko 15
 Only 8 percent votes were received
 saaf taur par nitish kii tulana main lalu lokapriy voton ke zyada bade ambara par kabiz hai
 Not only this, Lalu is the undisputed leader of the Yadavas, the largest populous caste in the state
 15 fisadi matadaata bhi isi jati se aate hai
 Due to this tug of war, Manjhi has definitely got some time to grow stronger
 yahi vajah he ki ve ab zyada nirnaayak or aakraamak dikhaai de rahe hai

 abhinav bharat mumbai ke shodharthi or doctor pankaj phadanis kii ore se daayar yachika main daawa kiya gaya ki varsh 1966 main gathit nyaayamurti je el kapur jaanch ayog sajeesh kaa pataa lagane main puri tarah naakaam rahaa
 The plot ended with the assassination of the Father of the Nation
 phadanis ne godse or narayan apte sahit anya aropiyon ko doshi tehraane ke liye vibhinn adaalaton kii ore se sahi maani gai teen goliyon kii kahani par bhi sawaal uthaae hai
 The culprits of Gandhi's assassination were hanged on 15 November 1949 while Savarkar was given the benefit of the doubt due to lack of evidence
 saavarkar se prerit hokar abhinav bharat, mumbai kii sthapana 2001 main hui thi or isane saamaajik or aarthik rup se kamjor virgon ke liye kaam karne kaa daawa kiya tha
 Fadnis claimed that his research and reports from those days suggest that Gandhi was shot with four bullets and that the difference between three and four bullets is significant because the pistol that Godse shot on 30 January 1948 contained seven bullets
 The spot was there and the remaining four unarmed bullets were recovered by the police
 daawey main kaha gaya he ki is halaat main yah tay he ki us pistaul se sirf teen goliyaan chalin
 He said in the petition that there was no possibility of Godse's pistol firing a fourth bullet
 yah duusare hatyare kii bandook se ai
 Apart from pleading with the apex court, Phadnis has also written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to remove the adverse remarks made by the Kapoor Commission against Savarkar
 varsh 2003 main sansad ke central haal main saavarkar kaa chitra lagaaya gaya tha
 Incidentally, Savarkar was born on 28 May in 1883 and today is his 134th birth anniversary

 She has announced that from January 27, she will visit the entire Maharashtra with a torch in her hands
 unhone apni naaraazgi jaahir karte hue yah bhi kaha ki party kuch logon ke haath main aa gai he
 This party has to be a party of all people
 aapako bataa den ki maharashtra ke bid jile main swargeey gopinath munde kii jayanti par unki beti pankaja munde ne ek raily kaa aayojan kiya tha
 Here we are telling you 10 big things of Pankaja's speech
 1- logon kaa pyaar aaj bhi mere sathraly main bijepi netaa pankaja munde ne apane pita ko yaad karte hue kaha ki gopinath munde bhale hi hamaare bich nahin hai, lekin aaj bhi unhen log kitna chaahate hai yah ab samaj aa rahaa he
 i have lost the election but the love of the people is still with me
 unhone aage kaha ki mujhe choti-moti chillar haar nahin jhukaa sakati he
 2- People were running news about me by quoting sources, while attacking all the news about myself in media, they said that on December 1, i wrote a post on Facebook
 aaj 12 disambar he
 i am watching what action i am taking
 log mere bare main sutron ke hawaale se khabaren chalaa rahe the
 There were sources of so many good people, so why did no one know that Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar are about to take oath
 3- main kisi ko dhokhaa nahin detibijepi netaaon kii shankaa ke bare main baat karte hue pankaja ne kaha ki log mere saath hai
 i took a struggle journey and people stood by me
 vidhansabha chunaav ke vakt maine devendra fadanvis ko mukhyamantri banane ke liye chunaav prachaar kiya
 Went for the promotion of every MLA to form a government in Maharashtra
 lekin un logon ko laga ki main dhokhaa karne vaali hum
 i have the rites of Gopinath Munde
 main kisi ko dhokhaa nahin detii hum
 4- i have no expectation from them
 Pankaja Munde further said that i have no expectation from them
 maine apane post main likhaa tha ki pratham raashtra, dwitiya party or tritiy main
 So how did those people think that i am going to cheat
 5- media main failaayaa gaya ki main party chhodane vaali humbijapi netaa ne apane sambodhan main aage kaha ki media main bhi yah baat chalaai gai ki maine party chhodane vaali hum
 Like Natha Bhau (eknath Khadse) said that if we are trying to get us out of the party door, what should we do? 6- afvaah udayi gai ki main alag party banaaungeepankaja munde ne apane virdohi tevar dikhaate hue kaha ki yah afvaah udayi gai ki main alag party banaaungi
 People from the party started calling me a criminal
 ek vakt laal krishna adwani, nitin gadakari, gopinath munde bijepi ko chalaate the
 But after him, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are leading the party
 yah to ek prakriya he
 New people will come and change
 party ek vyakti kii nahin he
 7- i did not expect the post
 Pankaja further said that the party has now come in the hands of some people
 is party ko sabhi logon kii party bananaa he naa ki kuch logon kii
 Today i am not even a member of the core committee
 mujhe koi pad kii apeksha bhi nahin he
 8- i did not like Ajit Pawar leaving the party
 While talking about Ajit Pawar's rebellion, he said that after Ajit Pawar was sworn in, i also saw tears in Supriya Sule's eyes
 mujhe yah dekhakar bada dukh hua
 i know what happens when the house breaks
 maine supriya sule or mere ek kaaman dost ko yah baat bataai ki ajit pavaar kaa party chhod kar janaa mujhe acha nahin laga
 Even after this, she continued to receive happiness from the people later, because her father Sharad Pawar was standing behind her
 9- mashaal lekar puure maharashtra kaa daura karuungipane sambodhan main pankaja munde ne aage kaha ki main apni party khadi karuungi yaa nahin yah main baad main tay karuungi
 i will travel all over Maharashtra with a torch in hand
 main dobaaraa sangharsh yatra nikaaloongi or bataaungi kii main kya hum
 10- If i am sitting silently, do not think that there is no fire
 is dauraan pankaja munde ne ghoshnaa kii he ki ve 27 janvari se maharashtra kaa daura karengi
 Comedians often entertain audiences by casting the voice of Amitabh Bachchan in comedy shows
 yahaan tak ki stars kii aawaaj nikalne vaale mimicri artist bhi sabase pehle amitabh bachchan kii awaz nikalne kii koshish karte hai, kyonki big bi kii shakhsiyat or unki awaz se log kaaphi prabhavit hote hai
 Now Hrithik Roshan's name has also been added to this episode
 ruthik roshan bhi apni aane vaali film 'kaabil' main amitabh bachchan kii aawaaj main baat karte sunai denge
 Actually, in the film 'kaabil', Hrithik is playing the role of a blind person, who makes a voice
 film main ruthik ek aam aadmi hai, jo film industry main dabing artist ke taur par kaam karke paisa kamaate hai
 Apart from Amitabh Bachchan, Hrithik will be seen making the voice of many other actors besides Bachchan
 tippaniyan It is being told that while doing the film, when Hrithik came out the voice of Amitabh Bachchan, then people were stunned because that voice was meeting Amitabh Bachchan to a great extent
 sutara yah bhi bataate hai ki pehle amitabh bachchan kii awaz ko kisi dabing artist se karaane kaa vichaar tha magar baad main ruthik ne khud ise karne kaa faisla liya or sound diziner rasul pukutti ke saath milakar ise anjaam diya
 In an interview to a newspaper, Hrithik said that i think the impact of Amitabh Bachchan's personality on our generation is the same
 uske alaava kadi mehnat kaa nateeja he
 Let us tell you that Hrithik Roshan also emits some stars and he likes to mimic
 darasal, film 'kaabil' main ruthik ek netraheen vyakti kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai, jo logon kii awaz nikaalte hai
 Hrithik is a common man in the film, who earns money by working as a dubbing artist in the film industry
 ruthik is film main amitabh bachchan ke alaava or bhi kai kalakaaron kii awaz nikaalte hue dekhe jaaenge
 The comments bataaya ja rahaa he ki film karte samay jab ruthik ne amitabh bachchan kii awaz nikali tab log dang rah gaye kyonki vah awaz amitabh bachchan se kaaphi had tak mil rahi thi
 Sources also state that at first there was an idea to get Amitabh Bachchan's voice from a dubbing artist but later Hrithik decided to do it himself and collaborated with sound designer Rasul Pookutty to do it
 ek akhbaar ko die intervyuu main ruthik ne kaha ki mujhe lagata he ki amitabh bachchan kii shakhsiyat kaa jo prabhaav hamaari janareshan par he yah usee kaa asar he
 Apart from that, hard work is the result
 aapako bataa den ki ruthik roshan bhi kuch sitaron kii awaz nikalate hai or mimicri karnaa unhen pasand he

 In view of this, Akhilesh Government and Samajwadi Party have engaged their leaders to go among the people and listen to their problems
 aise hi prayaas ke tahat bundelkhand ke mahoba jile main mantri darja praapt or sainik kalyaan nigam ke upaadhyaksh raaj bahadur lohia graamon main shaamil gaanv sijahari main pahunche
 His program was a night rest in the village itself with the problems of the people listening
 lekin vahaan ek chaatra ne aisi khari khari sunai ki netaji se jawaab nahin bana
 He thought it better to cancel the night rest program in the village and return to the district headquarters
 darasal, mantri darja praapt raaj bahadur gaanv pahunche to chele-chapatton kii ore se swaagat karne or phulmalaayen pahanaae jane se gadgad dikhe
 Chaupal was also added to the village head
 saath hi logon se kaha ki apni koi samasyaayein hai to bataaie, jinhen sarkari str par dur karne kaa prayaas kiya jayega
 People started counting problems like road, electricity and water
 kisi nerasancardkee samasya bataai
 In such a situation, Raj Bahadur was seen answering the same question on every question, 'our government has been four years, crores of rupees were given for many schemes
 ye samasyaayein pehle hi bataa dete to dur ho jaati, chaar saal tak chup kyon rahe
 'openly speaking in front of the Minister, now the student, who would tell Raj Bahadur ji that when he came to hear the first problems in the village like this in the last four years
 lekin raaj bahadur kii asli dikkat shuru honi abhi baaki thi
 Kiran, a 16-year-old student named Kiran, stood up to explain the problems, then the leader stopped speaking
 kiran ne bhari chaoupal main khari khari sunaate hue kaha, 'gaanv main pehle netaa aae the to inter college banane kaa bahut josh se vaada kiya tha
 But nothing was done
 ham chaatraon ko inter ke saath degree college bhi chahie
 We know you won't be able to give
 bas kah jaaenge
 You will be told to do everything with very good words but you will not get anything done
 kehane ke saath aap karnaa bhi sikhie ministar ji
 'vedas do for votes,' said Kiran, 'the minister's job is to improve the nation, to be a pioneer, not to listen to and avoid anyone
 yahi karte hai saare netaa
 Because elections are coming, big leaders are roaming everywhere
 ye kehete hue ki hamen jitaaen, hamen jitaaen
 It is good if you win, nothing is lost
 'chaatra ne netaji se maanga javaabachatra bolti ja rahi thi auranetajisamet sabhi log chupchaap sunate ja rahe the
 The student said, 'my words must be looking bad to everyone, because the truth seems bitter to everyone
 hamen inter college chahie, degree college chahie
 The student turned to Raj Bahadur and said, 'you will go
 lekin bataaie kya aap dilava paaenge college? chaatra ke sidhaa sawaal karne par raaj bahadur ne sakapakaate hue kaha ki aap sab se baat kar rahi ho to kar lo
 Then the student said, 'I am asking you, you tell me
 is par raaj bahadur ne kaha ki jo samasya aapane bataai he wo gaanv ke pradhan pehle hi bataa chuke hai
 Seeing the attitude of the student, she was finally forced to silence with applause

 But on September 28, when the Supreme Court gave its approval to the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court to decide the ownership of the land of Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid, life in Faizabad, the holy land of Ayodhya and the capital of the Nawabs, was normal as usual was

 As usual Muslim artisans were selling garlands, saffron flag, dholak and puja paraphernalia
 aakhir, atharvaveda main ayodhya ko 'devataaon kaa basaaya shahar or swarg jitna shant' bataaya gaya he
 Ayodhya, the birthplace of Lord Rama, is a towering tower damaged among temples on the banks of the Saryu River
 kisi ko nahin pataa iskaa kya mahatv he, haalanki is pavitra nagari ke sabhi logon ko lagata he ki mughal samraat aurangzeb ne ise ek aise kunda par banwaaya tha, jise lohe ke ek vishaal tave se dhakaa gaya he
 The symbol of monotheism for all religions is the famous Hanuman Garhi located a few furlongs from this tower, from where Hanuman keeps an eye on Ramjanmabhoomi or Ramkot
 hanuman gadhi kaa nirmaan avadh ke tunuk-mizaaj nawab shuja-ud-daula ne karavaaya tha

 Manjar Mehdi says that up to three years ago, Hanuman Garhi's Mahant used to give an Iftar feast during Ramadan, but it was stopped under pressure from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP)
 iske baavjood koi 1,200 mandiron vaali ayodhya ek aisa guladasta he jisamen tarah-tarah ke sugandhit phool hai
 Ayodhya means something that could not be won and was a symbol of mutual fervor, but the hindu-muslim dispute made it a symbol of religious and communal conflict
 adalati ladaai main ek vaadi, 91 varshiya hashim ansaari yaad karte hai, ''jab tak hindu-musalamaanon ke dharmasthalon kaa maamla kanoonee tha, tab tak uski maryaada or garima barkaraar thi
 But now it is over

 "I worry more about hindu-muslim unity and mutual love than the building (construction) of the mosque
" ''itane hi chintit ramalala ke mukhya pujari acharya satyendra das hai
 "I don't understand why some people are fighting?" When God does not differentiate among humans, who are we to do this? ”many of the Hindus and Muslims of Ayodhya say that outsiders are spreading hatred and bringing this holy land into disrepute
 par adhiktar log ayodhya kii utpatti kii yah puranic katha ko maanate hai: ''apni janata ke rakshak, brahma ke sabase bade putr swayambhu manu ek baar apane pita ke ghar haath jodakar pahunche
 Pleased Brahma asked, 'son, tell me fast, why have you come here?' Manu bowed and said, 'you have ordered me to create the universe, please give me a suitable place for my abode
 'brahma apane putr ko saath lekar bhagwaan vishnu ke dham vaikunth gaye or haath jodakar bhagwaan vishnu se madhur swar main bole, 'he devon ke dev, aap apane shraddhaluon par sadaa krupa-drushti rakhte hai or manu unamem se ek hai

 After this Brahma came with Manu to Ihloka and Vishnu sent Vasishtha and Vishwakarma to build the city according to his wish

 Scholars say that since the 12th century, Sufi saints have been considering Ayodhya as the center of spiritual education

 lekin 1980 ke dashak ke shuru main ram janmabhumi-babari masjid kii aandhi main sufiyon or pagambaron kii maujuudagi ko bhula diya gaya
 On the other hand, there was a new twist in the story of Ayodhya when some Buddhists wanted to become a party in the legal battle of Ramjanmabhoomi dispute
 unka kahana tha ki ayodhya buddha centre tha lekin madhya yug main janajagran andolan ke dauraan mathon par kabja karke unhen mandiron main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 But no claim was found in this claim
 buddha parampara main ayodhya ko saket yaa kaushal ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jo bhagwaan buddha ke pita shuddhodhan ke raaj kaa hissaa tha

 The head of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), Dr
 praveen togadiya somvaar ko achaanak subah laapata hote hai
 After several hours, Togadia is found unconscious late at night, after which he is admitted to Chudamani Hospital in Shahibag area
 gujarat or rajasthan police ko subah se hi unki talash thi
 But even before the news of Togadia's disappearance, there is a stir in politics
 praveen togadiya kii gumshadagi ke saath kai sawaal khadey hote hai
 Because these days warrants are being issued continuously against them
 phir mangalvaar ko togadiya khud media se baat karte hai or apane khilaaf sajeesh kaa aarope lagaate hai
 On Monday, on the day of the disappearance of Praveen Togadia, the Rajasthan Police approaches him with a warrant to arrest him in a 10-year-old case
 par togadiya nahin milte hai, pataa chalata he ki wo ek auto main baithkar kahin akele gaye hai
 In such a situation, Rajasthan Police goes back without arresting Togadia
 10 saal purana kesabta den ki rajasthan police somvaar kopraveen togadiya ke khilaafjis maamle main giraftaar karne gai thi, wo 10 saal purana he
 Dr
 Togadia reached there 10 years ago after killing three Hindu youths in Rajasthan
 unhen kaarykram karne kii prashasan ne anumati nahin di thi
 Despite this, Togadia addressed the people
 usee maamle main unke khilaaf gairajamaanti warrant jari tha, jiske tahat rajasthan police unhen giraftaar karne ke liye ahmedabad pahunchi thi
 But before the police arrived, Togadia reported the disappearance, the police returned without arrest
 gauratlab he ki pichley hafte hi praveen togadiya ke khilaaf gujarat kii metropolitan court ke jariye gairajamaanti warrant jari kiya tha
 After which he appeared in court and was released after getting bail
 ye maamla bhi 21 saal purana he
 Atmaram, who was a minister in the Gujarat government, is beaten up
 somvaar ko phir unke khilaaf jari warrant or ghatana kram ke chalate sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 After all, what is the reason that legal proceedings have started against Togadia
 21 saal puraane maamle main court main hajir hue the tab togdia ne bataaya tha ki unke khilaaf raajnneetik shandyatra kiya ja rahaa he
 When asked who was conspiring, he said that those who do not want Ram temple to be built and those people do not want us to raise voice against unemployment, free education
 togadiya ne tab bhi sawaal khadaa kiya tha ki wo jab ahmedabad main hi rahete hai to unhen pehle saman kyon nahin diya gaya
 How the direct warrant was issued
 aise main ye bhi sawaal uth rahaa he ki aakhir kyon itane saalon baad togadiya ki khilaaf karrwai tej ho rahi he, kahin ye kisi ke siyaasi ishaare par to nahin he
 According to experts, Togadia was speaking fiercely against the issue of farmers and unemployment issues in the Gujarat elections
 wese main unke khilaaf sarkaar ye karrwai unke ore bijepi ke bich rishton main ai daraar kaa nateeja to nahin he

 He said that once this system has come, after that the same type of system will be possible in the whole country

 aadi shakti jagdamba kaa vikaraal swaroop hai maa kaali
 Their worship has different importance
 kehete hai dushton or rakshason ke daman ke liye hi devi maa ne yah sanhaarak avatar liya tha
 Mother Kalratri is the seventh form of Goddess
 maankalaratri kaa rang kaala haior ye trinetradhari hai
 There is a wonderful garland of lightning in the neck of Maa Kalratri
 inke haathon main khadg or kanta he or inkaa kaa vaahan 'gadhaa' he
 Mankalratri is also called Shubhankari
 sansar main vyaapt dushton or paapiyon ke hriday main bhay ko janm dene vaali maa hai maa kaalaratri
 Mother Kali is the main goddess of the Shakti sect
 inhen dushton ke sanhaar kiadhishthatri devibhi kaha jaataa he
 a story related to their appearance is very popular
 
 
 maa kaalaratrise judi kahani
 
 
 Goddess Durga took the incarnation of Kalratri to slay the blood of the Asuras king
 maa kaali nirantar sanhaar karti hui vinashlila rach rahi thim
 Their fierce nature and lowliness created a chaos in the creation
 aise main maa kaali ko pratyaksh rup main rokane kii shakti swayan adidev mahadev main bhi nahin thi
 Just then, at the request of the gods, to calm Mahakali's wrath, Shiva had planned to lie in their path, so that the goddess would calm down and return to her original form by finding the lord of the Charachara universe and her husband Parmeshwar under her feet
 maa kaali kii mahimashakti kaa mahanatam swarup mahavidhyaon kaa hota he
 'maa Kali' occupies the first place among the ten Mahavidyas
 shumbh-nishumbh ke vadh ke samay maa kaali kaarang kaala pad gaya
 His color became black due to the sharp mass coming out of mother Kali's body
 inaki upasna se shatru, bhay, durghatana or tantra-mantra ke prabhaavon kaa samul naash ho jaataa he
 Mother Kali protects her devotees and grants them the boon of healing
 shani grah shantjyotish main shani grah kaa sambandh maa kaalaratri se mana jaataa he
 It is believed that worshiping him in the problem of Saturn gives amazing results
 maa kaalaratri ke pujan se shani kaa prabhaav kam hota he or saadhe saati kaa asar nahin hota
 Worship of mother Kali is done in two ways
 pehali saamaanya puja or duusari tantra puja
 Normal worship can be performed by anyone, but Tantra Puja cannot be done without the Guru's protection and instructions
 maa kaali kii upasna kaa sabase upyukt samay madhya raatri kaa hota he
 Red and black objects have special significance in their worship
 shatru or virodhiyon ko shant karne ke liema kaaliki upasna amogh he
 Mother Kali should not be worshiped for any wrong purpose
 mantra jaap se zyada prabhavi hota he maa kaali kaa dhyaan karnaa
 So you too should worship this form of Shakti keeping these rules in mind and try to follow the path of Satkarma
 kyonki aap jitnazyada buraai se dur hote jaaenge, maa kaali ke utane hi kareeb hote jaaenge
 Then mother Kali will protect you from every disaster in the world

 The first incident is of the ATM of Union Bank of India in Beur Mor area of the capital

 The second incident is in Saguna Mor area where criminals broke into the Canara Bank ATM and stole Rs 8 lakh
 aparaadhiyon ne gola road sthit indian oversij bank ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya

 com / gfypq8rcav Stating that India is working without leadership, Azim Premji, the head of the information technology giant Wipro, said that while trusting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, he should be given the proper time to pursue reforms
 azim premaji kaa yah vaktavy desh ke pramukh udyogpati ratan tata kii us tippanee ke kuch hi samay baad aayaa he jisamen tata ne kaha tha ki desh kii maujuuda aarthik chintaaon ke liye pradhanmantri singh par hi puraa dosha madhnaa anuchit hoga
 Premji said, 'it is difficult to say how the reform process will proceed
 manmohan singh ne pradhanmantri kii apni jimmedaariyon ke saath saath ab vitt mantralay kaa kaarybhaar bhi sambhala he
 That is why we should have hope now and they should be given suitable time for this
 ’premaji ne kaha ki nitigat prayaason se bhi zyada mahatvapurn yah he ki sarkaar ko maujuuda nitiyon main shaamil vibhinn muddon ko hi suniyojit tareeke se amal main laana chaiye
 He said, 'whether it is the infrastructure sector project or the government project, the projects which are going on and which need to be expanded, the government needs to focus on the broad areas which are to be implemented and which have been decided
 yahi kaam ho saktaa he, kyonki yah sarkaar kii ahm jimmedaari he
 'last week, Tata tweeted that it would be wrong to blame only the Prime Minister for the problems coming in the way of economic reforms of the country
 singh ke samarthan main khadey hote huye tata ne kaha, ‘yah kaaphi durbhagyapurna or dukhad he ki pichley kuch maheenon ke dauraan vipaksh, media, kuch nagarikon ne or yahaan tak ki sattapaksh kii party ke kuch sadasyon ne hamaare pradhanmantri ke bare main nirdayatapurvak kaha or likhaa he

 unhone kaha he ki bharat main job milane ko safalataa kaha jaataa he, lekin creativity kahaan he? steve wajaniek vahi shaks hai jinhone pehla aipal computer banaaya tha jiskaa naam Apple 1 he
 Actually, he has expressed his opinion about the Indian educational system
 unhone ye kaha he ki bhartiya shiksha vyavstha padhai par tiki he lekin creativity ko badhaava nahin detii he
 In an interview, Wozniak said, 'how talented are you? If you are an engineer or an MBA, then you must test your degree, but ask yourself how creative you are
 ET ko die intervyuu main unhone yah bhi kaha he kiunhen is baat kii ummid nahin heki bharat main google, fasebuk or aipal jaisi duniya badi tech companiyon jaisi company taiyaar ho sakati he
 According to Wozniak, for example in India, there is a big tech company Infosys and that too is not innovative
 unhone yah bhi ummid jataai he ki infosis philhal to global tech diggaj companiyon ke res main aa hi nahin saktaa he
 While answering the questions, he has also given the opinion that the Indian lacks creativity and they are not encouraged for such a career
 unhone kaha, ‘yahaan safalataa kaa matlab acedmik accelens, padhai, siikhnaa, acchhee job or behatar life jeena he
 Creativity comes to an end when it becomes easy to predict your behavior all become the same
 newjiland jaise chote desh ko dekhie jahaan lekhak, singer, khilaadi hai or yah ek alag duniya he’ The 12th examination of Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has started from 2 March

 At the same time, along with students, teachers also believe that this paper was prepared according to the average children

 In India, on one hand there is more than enough stock of food grains, on the other side there is a huge shortage of pulses and oilseeds (edible oil)
 yah ek kism kaa virodhabhas he
 This contradiction can be overcome by applying a reliable shopping regime for pulses and edible oil
 bhartiya rashtriya sahakaari krishi vipanan sangh (nafed) apana mul kaam yani daal or khaadya telon kii kharid karne kaa kaam, kai saal se kar hi nahin paa rahaa
 Due to this, farmers are not attracted towards pulses and oilseeds
 nafed fouran punargathan kii aavashyaktaa he taaki yah apana mul kaam kar sake
 This will attract farmers to the cultivation of pulses and oilseeds
 " kharif fasal sijan 2015-16 ke liye apni report jari karte hue krishi mantralay ke krishi laagat or mulya ayog (siesipi) ne is saal 27 march ko yah sifarish kii
 a fortnight later, in April, the Meteorological Department predicted less than normal rainfall in the country, which eventually proved to be correct
 jiskaa ek matlab yah bhi tha ki lagaataar duusare saal dalhan kii fasal kamjor ho sakati he
 After this, on 1 May, the Bangalore Food and Pulses Wholesaler Association wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and warned of another big threat, "huzoor, some big companies import large-scale pulses and sell them in Myanmar, Africa and Mumbai
 Are depositing in warehouses
 is saal aayaat kii gai daalon kaa 80 fisadi hissaa in companiyon ke paas he
 Taking advantage of the shortage of pulses in the country, these companies have so far raised prices by 40 to 50 percent
 jis tarah inhone maharashtra sarkaar se stock limit khatm karvaa lee he, usase inaki takat kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 "these three facts explain different aspects of the rapid process of arhar dal's double century
 siesipi kii report bataa rahi he ki desh main tel or daalon kii paidaavaar na sirf kam he, balki kisaan isaki ore se munh bhi mode rahe hai
 India is the largest producer of pulses, as well as their biggest market, and pulses are used most in food here
 aise main desh main har saal 30 se 40 lakh ton daal kii kami ko aayaat ke jariye puraa karnaa hota he
 Due to crop failure this year, this reduction has been reduced to 50 to 6 million tonnes
 udhar, kamjor monsoon kii bhavishyavaanee ne asli sankat aane se pehle hi mahangaai kii bhaavana ko hawa de di
 Says Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of the Bangalore Food Association, "among these speculations, the international market understood that now demand from India would increase
 aise main daam pehle hi badaae lage
 The big companies bought pulses from the pulp exporting countries and stocked up that when India buys, they will make profit
 " unke mutabik, samasya itani bhar nahin he ki desh main daal kii kami he, samasya yah bhi he ki bharat sarkaar kii taraf se daal kharid kaa tender aate hi videsh main bhi daal mahangi hone lagati he
 It is worth noting that despite the declining trend in the prices of food items worldwide, the prices of pulses are rising in the international market
 2008 main bharat main jab chini kaa sankat hua tha, tab bhi bharat se maang aate hi videshi bazaar main bhi chini ke daam badaae lage the
 Along with the proposal of government procurement, the disease of increasing market prices is so chronic that during his prime ministership, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru wrote a letter to the Chief Ministers on August 1, 1957, explaining, "it is assumed that if the government is open market When you go shopping, the prices go up
 doosraa upaay sirf yah he ki khadyann or anya jaruri chizon kii sarkari kharid ke vaazib daam phinns kar liye jaaen
 "in the era of liberalization, the government has no other option
 yani desh ab us sthiti main pahunch gaya he, jahaan na kharidne or kharidne donon hi sthitiyon main daal kii keemat baxi he
 Suspicious of black marketing, but could the disease have been prevented before it had progressed? Agriculture expert Devendra Sharma argues, "the government is now going to set stock limits, raiding hoarders
" agar yah kaam daal ke 100 ru
 Things would not have been so bad if it had been done at the kilo level
 " udhar, congress netaa anand sharma centre sarkaar par hamalaa karte hai, ''aankade uthaakar dekh lijie desh main har saal 40 se 50 lakh ton daal kii kami rahati he
 This year, knowing that the shortfall is large, only 6 lakh tonnes were imported, whereas it should have been 5 million tonnes
 isse kalabazari badi he
 The Central Government is responsible for this
 " lekin bihar chunaav main daal ke mudda ban jane ke baad centre bhi aakraamak mudra main he
 Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh and Food and Supplies Minister Ram Vilas Paswal have been roaming clear on this issue in Bihar elections
 paswan kaa kahana he, ''keemten sthir rakhane ke liye centre sarkaar ne 500 karod ru
 Has created a Price Stabilization Fund from the Corpus Fund
 lekin rajya sarkaron ne iskaa laabh hi nahin uthaaya
 "here in Delhi, the entire government under the leadership of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley seems to be struggling with this issue
 jetali sarkaar kii kisi tarah kii khami maanane kii bajaae mahangaai ke liye paidaavaar main giravat ko hi jimmedaar bataa rahe hai
 They are also saying that the state governments are not cooperating in the raiding work
 naakaam rahe nitigat faislelekin sarkaar ke prayaas main kuch na kuch kami to jarur rahi he
 If we look at the rate of cost of arhar pulses in CACP report, it is clear that till April 2014, inflation in arhar was negative
 yani manmohan singh sarkaar kaa kaarykaal khatm hone tak arhar kii daal kii keemten ghat rahi thim
 At the same time, since Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister in May 2014, the rate of inflation in Arhar has been increasing from the negative zone till now
 aisa nahin he ki modi sarkaar ne halaat kaabo karne kii koshish na kii ho
 The Center advised the state governments to abolish the APMC ante
 iske peeche tark yah tha ki abhi kisaan fasal ko chihnit mandiyon main hi bech pate hai or is par unhen tex bhi dena padataa he
 If the farmer has the freedom to sell the produce to anyone, he will get better prices and the doors of this business will be opened for the private sector
 farvari 2014 main jetali ne rajyon se fal or subjiyon ko apiemasi act se baahar karne kii apil kii
 Only states like Delhi and Uttarakhand obeyed him
 haalanki jis tarah dilli main bhi daalen mahangi hai usase nahin lagata ki yah badlaav koi bada asar daalata
 The second task was the central government to create a price stabilization fund, which Paswan is referring to
 lekin sarkaar is kosh kii sthapana 26 march, 2015 ko kar pai
 And at that time its basic purpose was to keep the prices of vegetables like potatoes and onions stable
 lekin yah kosh kitna kargar hua, ise pyaaj kii keemat 80 ru
 The situation of reaching kilos cleared it
 ab jab daalen sir par chadhi hai to sarkaar ek baar isi kosh ke sahare inaki keemten ghataane kii baat kar rahi he, yahaan bhi ab tak naakaami hi haath ai he
 Is there any way to deal with this situation if there is a time for basic change? On this question, CACP Chairman Dr
 ashok vishandaas gambhirtha se kehete hai, ''kalabazari karne waalon par chhapemari kii karrwai fori taur par jaruri he, lekin yah fori maraham jaisi he
 The problem needs permanent treatment
 " 30,000 se zyada kisaanon se sidhe samvaad kar chuke dow
 Bishan Das believes that the country will have to convince its farmers that their pulses and oilseed crops will get a fair price
 nunatam samarthan mulya kii pranali se in kisaanon ko jodgaye ke liye sarkaar ko kargar prachaar tantra apnaanaa hoga
 The government is currently spending around Rs 72,000 crore every year in the form of fertilizer subsidy
 kharch kar rahi he, agar yahi sabsidi diarect cash transfar ke jariye di jaae to 12,000 karod ru
 Can be saved annually
 ab ye dirghakaalik upaay or na taale jaaen
 It is a matter of immediate measures, the price will stop in a few days, because the demand also falls due to the burden of inflation

 He called the Patna Shelter Home a death lok and said that the relation of Manisha Dayal and officials and leaders should be made public
 pappu yadav ne jaanch par 10 sawaal uthaae1
 Whether it is the case of the grand murder of Muzaffarpur or the death-folk of Aasra Home in Patna, what is the reason that action is not being taken against the big officials of the Social Welfare Department, its parent
 saaf taur par kai iees adhikari brajesh thakur ormaneesha dayalke gang main shaamil dikh rahe hai, to kya inhen bachaane or filon se gadabadi kaa sakshya mitaane ko chaape main deree kii ja rahi he

 manju verma ne munh khol diya he
 She is openly taking the name of Bihar's Urban Development Minister Suresh Sharma
 verma ke pati chandrashekhar verma mahapapi brajesh thakur ke hamapyaale rahe hai, isliye suresh sharma ke bare main bhi sab pataa he
 Anyway, Sharma's stories have been famous from Muzaffarpur to Bengal
 to phir suresh sharma ke bare mennithish kumaror susheel kumaar modi kab faisla karenge? sibiai ko bhi turant karrwai kerani chahie

 Patna Asra Home, which was made dead by Manisha Dayal and Chirantan Kumar
 aisa lag rahaa he ki patna police kii jaanch bhi manisha dayaal ke mayalok main fansati ja rahi he
 In three days of interrogation, the Patna police could neither catch the other big fish involved in this racket nor expose the blue world of Manisha Dayal
 saansad ne maang kii he ki mobile ke sidiaar ko turant saarvajanik kiya jaae or nasha-e-husn ke kaarobaar main shaamil sabhi logon ke khilaaf karrwai ho
 We will file a writ petition in the Patna High Court regarding the CBI investigation
 5
 The identity of Sunil Kumar, IAS director, who got Manisha Dayal direct entry into the social welfare department, is clear
 phir bhi inke khilaaf karrwai main deree kyon ho rahi he
 It is known that by taking advantage of this delay, Sunil Kumar is engaged in securing unaccounted wealth earned by corrupt means
 6
 IAS SM Raju's name is known in every scam in Bihar
 mahadalit mishan main ghotaale ke saath hi or na jane kitne ghotaale bihar main inke naam ho chuke hai
 Now connection is also being made with Manisha Dayal, then why does Bihar's investigating agencies prepare such a weak case against the scammer who repeatedly scams, and gets relief from the court without going to jail
 relif milane tak jaanch agency giraftaar bhi nahin karti
 a huge plantation scam has also taken place in Bihar under Raju's leadership
 siem nitish kumaar isaki puri jaanch karaaen
 7
 aakhir kya kaaran he ki manisha dayaal or chirantan kumaar kii paapi sanstha ke adhyaksh kaa naam nahin kholaa ja rahaa he
 The members of the governing body are also not being told
 aasraa home ke mritylok ke paap main sabhi bhagidaar hai
 So are these such big names that there is fear of earthquake in Bihar, so it is being saved from police action by hiding it? 8
 pappu yadav ke mutabik, manisha dayaal kii spisi duniya main saiyr-sapate bhi bahut the
 The delhi-mumbai connection was increased
 pichley teen saal ke manisha dayaal ke saiyr-sapaaton kii jaanch air tikat ke madhyam se ho
 Identification of those who come along, many faces will meet again and again
 9
 According to Yadav, there is strong news that during interrogation in remand, when Manisha Dayal's mobile was opened for some time, even big phones started coming fast
 is jaanch main koi kotahi nahin honi chahie ki let nit partiyon main manisha dayaal kahaan-kahaan jaati thi or der raat kinake saath chating karti thi

 log bataa rahe the ki laudspikar se elaan hone ke kuch hi der baad hazaron log aa gaye
 But no one is telling who he was
 sab ek duusare ko bachaane main lage hai
 When asked the question of who those four people were, everyone falls silent
 yah sawaal poochne par un chaar paanch ladakon ko koi jaanata nahin tha to unke kehane par itani bheed kaise aa gai, sab chup ho jate hai
 Now everyone is telling their boys sick
 duusare gaanv se log aa gaye
 Thousands of people cannot fit in a street
 gaanv bhar main fail gaye honge
 Even then no one saw them
 jo pakade gaye hai unhen nirdosh bataaya ja rahaa he
 One should be considered guilty only after investigation and court decision, but the way the whole village has become normal after the violence, it is unlikely that the police will ever be able to expose the mob

 When have the police been able to do so? maance gaay kaa tha yaa bakrii kaa forencik jaanch se pataa chal bhi gaya to kya hoga

 After all, who would have told all these things to Prashant? Will anyone else come between these young people long before the Monday night crowd? Taking the incomplete books and things of history?

 When Union Minister Uma Bharti refused to contest the elections, everyone's eyes were fixed on the Jhansi Lok Sabha seat
 is seat se aakhir pratyaashee kounhoga isko lekar kayaas abhi jari hai, lekin jo naam saamne aa rahe hai unamem ek naam dalbadalu ummidavaar kaa bhi saamne aane ke baad bhaajapa kii sthaneey ikaisann he
 It is believed that Uma Bharti herself is advancing the name that has once raised slogans to make Mayawati and Sonia Gandhi the Prime Minister
 yah naam he gangacharan rajput kaa
 Gangacharan has recently joined the BJP
 vah iske pehle basapa main the
 In Congress too, Ganga Charan has spent a long time
 jhaansi seat bundelkhand kii sabase mahatvapurn seat maani jaati he isliye is seat par sabhi kii nazren bhi tiki hui hai
 That is also because the Congress has already left this seat for the smaller party National Jan Adhikar Party
 isse congress sanghathan kii sthaneey ikai main gussa he
 Now the BJP is also seen walking on the path of the Congress
 darasal, jhaansi lalitpur loksabhaa seat 2014 tak congress ke paas thi
 From here, Congress leader Pradeep Jain Aditya won the election in 2009 and was made a minister at the Center
 bhaajapa is seat par 1998 ke baad kabhi nahin jiti
 Here the Congress won in 1999, SP in 2004 and again in 2009
 iske baad bhaajapa ne uma bharti jaisi badi netaa par daanv lagaakar apni khoi hui seat ko vaapis jeet liya tha
 The BJP won all the four seats of Bundelkhand in Uttar Pradesh
 vaise ise modi lahar kii vyapak jeet kaa nateeja bhi mana ja saktaa he, lekin ab loksabhaa chunaav kii ranbheri baj chuki he or bundelkhand main siyaasi sameekaran kya honge isko lekar kayaas shuru ho gaye hai
 The most important boast is the Jhansi Lok Sabha seat
 vah isliye kyonki yahaan se saansad or kendriya mantri uma bharti ne chunaav nahin ladgaye kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 He has written a letter to party president Amit Shah urging him not to contest elections
 uma bharti ke chunaav nahin ladane ke elaan ke baad yahaan tikat ke daavedaaron kii sankhya main kaaphi ijapha ho gaya he, lekin kuch naam aise bhi hai jinke naam par logon ko baari aashcharya bhi ho saktaa he
 Those who can be nominated from BJP for this seat include Ravi Sharma, MLA from Jhansi Sadar seat, Babina MLA Rajiv Singh Paricha, Lalitpur MLA Ramratan Kushwaha, Hargovind Kushwaha, Ravindra Shukla and Sanjeev Shringirishi and Vandana Pathak
 iske saath hi lodh jati ke pratyaashee ke rup main ganga charan rajput or garautha vidhayak jawahar laal rajput kaa naam bhi charchaaon main he
 It is believed that according to caste balance in Bundelkhand, Brahmins from Banda, Thakur from Hamirpur, Dalits from Jalaun and Lodh candidates from Jhansi were given an opportunity
 yah sameekaran kargar bhi hua or bhaajapa yahaan se sabhi siten jeet gai
 Uma Bharti will no longer contest from Jhansi seat, who will be the BJP candidate from here
 pichley kuch dinon se jo naam uchhalkar saamne aa rahaa he vah chaunkaane vaala he
 Ganga Charan Rajput can be made a candidate from Jhansi seat
 gangacharanbahari pratyaashee hai isliye unako tikat die jane kii charchaa se sthaneey bhaajapa ikai sann he
 Ravi Sharma, who is seeking a ticket from the BJP, has himself predicted the loss of the party by saying that Ganga Charan is an outsider
 varisht patrkaar raghuveer sharma kehete hai, gangacharan kaa naam chaunkaane vaala he
 Most of the BJP officials and public representatives do not agree on this
 yadi gangacharan ko tikat mila to party ko bada nuksaan hone kii puri sambhaavna he
 Raghuveer says, even if the party is looking for a candidate from the OBC Lodh caste, the BJP still has a lot of faces, among them a better face than Ganga Charan is that of Garautha MLA Jawahar Lal Rajput
 jawahar kii kisaan chhavi unako duusare pratyaashiyon se behatar banaati he
 It is believed that in the meeting of BJP officials recently, it has been made clear that no outsider will be accepted here except Uma Bharti
 ek bhaajapa netaa to yahaan tak kehete hai, gangacharan rajput kaa janm jalon main hua or unhone hamirpur mahoba main apni siyaasi jameen taiyaar kii
 Why does he want to come to Jhansi? kisi bhi bahari pratyaashee kaa jhaansi se chunaav laduya nuksaan pahunchayegaa
 Why would the BJP want to stake a claim on Dalbadu? Ganga Charan Rajput, who joined BJP from BSP, has been an MP from Hamirpur thrice till now
 1989 main ye janata dal ke tikat par chunaav jite the, jabaki 1996 or 1998 main bhaajapa se hamirpur ke saansad bane the
 In 2004, by joining the Congress wave, Rajput joined the Congress
 iske baad ye 2009main basapa ke hathi par savaar ho gaye
 Now he has again entered the BJP
 mana ja rahaa he ki gangacharan kendriya mantri uma bharti ke kareebi hai
 He is asking for a ticket to Jhansi and has convinced Uma Bharti for this
 purv saansad ganga charan rajput ke bare main ek kissa mashhoor he ki 18 may 2004 ko jab sonia gandhi ne piem pad thukraa diya tha to inhone khud ko goli maarane ke liye canapati par revolver taan lee thi
 This whole incident took place outside Sonia Gandhi's house in Delhi
 revolver jaanch main khaali pai gai thi
 After which his play became public
 congress ne bina lade hi ganvaa di jhansijhansi loksabhaa seat par congress kaa chunavi itihaas anya dalon ke mukaable acha rahaa he
 Here, Congress has won nine times in the elections held fifteen times
 bhaajapa paanch baar chunaav jiti he or sapa sirf ek baar
 In such a situation, the Congress suddenly put this seat in the part of the smaller party National Jan Adhikar Party
 is party ke pramukh babusingh kushvaha jhaansi se chunaav lard sakate hai
 Congressmen are not happy about this
 ab bhaajapa bhi bahari pratyaashee ko yahaan se utarkar congress kii tarj par chal sakati he
 It is also likely to be opposed

 According to the Delhi High Court, the use of abuses and abuses is common among jawans during conversations with their comrades
 iske saath hi adaalat ne siaisef ke ek jawan ko seva main behaal karne kaa aadesh de diya, jise apane varisht saathi ke saath apshabdon ke istemaal ke aarope main sevamukt kar diya gaya tha
 a division bench of Justice Pradeep Nandrajog and Justice Suresh Kat delivered the verdict on the petition of Krishna Pal Singh, a constable dismissed from Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) unit IOC, Panipat
 khandpeeth ne buudhvaar ko apane faisle main kaha, "jivan ke anubhav, kanoon ke tark se zyada pramanik hote hai
 Our experience tells us that jawans use street print language while interacting with each other and freely question with abuses
 " adaalat kaa yah aadesh 16 disambar, 2002 ko ghati us ghatana se sambandhit he, jisamen krishna paal singh kii ek up nireekshak rel pandit ke saath takaraar ho gai thi
 Pandit was the shift in-charge of CISF unit IOC, Panipat
 singh ne aarope lagaaya tha ki pandit ne jhagada shuru kiya or unhen thappad maaraa, jabaki pandit kaa aarope tha ki singh ne unhen gaali di or un par hamalaa kiya
 Singh was suspended with immediate effect on December 17, 2002, after preliminary investigation into the incident
 singh ne jaanch samiti ko 16 disambar, 2002 ko bataaya tha ki unki tabiyat thik nahin thi or jab unki duty raat nau baje samaapt ho gai or unki jagah doosraa jawan nahin pahunchaa to unhone pandit se phone par sampark kiya or jaananaa chaha ki unhen duty se chhudaane ke liye doosraa jawan kyon nahin pahunchaa
 According to the petition, "pandit had told Krishnapala that he had requested the head constable Devendra Kumar to supervise Singh's post till another one is on duty

 "the bench said," The petitioner was not in good mood due to ill health and could not tolerate such language, and this led to a controversy and then a scuffle
 " peeth ne kaha, "hamane paaya ki is maamle main paristhiti evam tathyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue na to anushaasanamak praadhikaran ne vishleshan kiya, na to apili praadhikaran ne or na punarikshan praadhikaran ne hi

 Srikanth told PTI, 'I am withdrawing from China Open (november 14-19)
 meri mansapeshiyon main khinchaav he or chikitsakon ne mujhe ek saptaah tak aaraam karne kii salaah di he
 Srikanth lost to HS Prannoy in the final of the National Championship

 He said, 'I am playing continuously
 isliye yah thodaa or bura ho gaya
 My injury will be cured within a week

 ' The international cab service Uber has already been banned in Delhi, in many other states, it has fallen on it
 ek mahila akjicutive ke saath rape kii ghatana ke baad company kaa ravaiya nihaayat hi sharmnaak rahaa
 As the investigation is progressing, questions are being raised about his behavior and manner of work
 ab pataa chal rahaa he ki company ne pehle bhi ai shikayaton par koi karrwai nahin kii
 The apathy he showed in the personal investigation of the driver is inexcusable
 ek bhayanak apradhi bagaiyr license ke uski sarvice kaa hissaa bana hua tha or company soti rahi
 He did not take any action despite the complaints
 uske khilaaf is maamle main karrwai honi hi chahie
 It was a case of criminal indifference and should be punished severely
 lekin sawaal sirf yah nahin he
 After this incident, the government immediately banned many more cab services, not only Uber
 ab yah badi bahes kaa mudda he
 Is it appropriate to ban all such services after any crime? Is not the government's reaction a bit harsh? Will the falling law and order situation be rectified by doing so? One has to find answers to these questions as they are long term
 relon main kai baar aisi ghatnaayen ghati hai, kai baar usamen pulicekarmi bhi shaamil rahe hai
 Then the question is, will the railways also be banned? Perhaps this question may seem full of exaggeration, but it has some power
 yah maamla beshak bahut gambhir he, lekin iskaa ilaaj is tarah se nahin ho saktaa
 First, there should be a system of punishing the culprit and then other aspects related to it should be investigated
 ubar jaisi cab seva ke khilaaf kya karrwai ho uski bhi tajabij ho
 There are holes in the law with him, they should also be detected and filled
 kanoon kaa paalan hua yaa nahin
 This is also a big question
 police vyavastha kii kamajoriyon kaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie or phir koi doorgaami faisla karnaa chahie
 Due to this shameful scam, companies providing cab services will not get anything by banning them
 zyada se zyada yah hoga ki ye kaam band kar dengi jiskaa nuksaan transport kii samasya se jujhate nagarikon ko hi uthaanaa padegaa
 Taking a step awake from sudden sleep can be costly
 yahaan par ek sawaal yah bhi he ki kya nirbhaya cond ke baad hamane privet bason par bain laga diya kya? sach to he ki sakhti or kadi karrwai se is tarah ke aparaadh karne waalon ke man main bhay paidaa kiya ja saktaa he
 It should be compulsory for cab servants running to get their drivers' documents checked periodically
 unhen aadhunik nigaraanee upkarnon ke daayre main rakhana chahie
 Strict action should be taken against those who do not do this and not all cab services should be banned
