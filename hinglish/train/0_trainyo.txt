 That too in a pub
 ab us party main kya-kya hota he ye to aap is party kaa theme dekhte hi andaja laga lenge
 The theme of the party was sex and smoke
 gudgaanv ke city centre kaa mashhoor pub bazz in
 Inside the pub, boys and girls of the school and their footsteps snag at the current numbers
 kaayade-kanoonon se dur charadivari ke andar naaballig haathon main chhalakate jam or hawa main ghulata flavored hukke ke dhuen kaa gubaar
 On the theme of Sex and Smoke, gradually there was a full night of fun and then party after party
 lekin isse pehle ki ye party puri tarah javaan hoti, isamen police kii entry ho gai
 Now the place of music and fun in the pub was silent
 kuch der pehle tak thirakate kadam ab tham chuke the
 The party was in Jo, Jah and Jah
 use vahiin rukne kaa hukum mila or phir yahaan maujuud sabhi ke sabhi party goars kii masti jaise ek hi jatke main hawa ho gai
 The law came to be heavy on those who flouted the law with smoke rings
 phir dekhte hi dekhte police ne pub ko sil kar diya
 But the risk of notoriety was no less if the party pictures being held inside the closed room were common
 lihaaja, jisase jaise ban padaa, usne apana cheharaa chhipaana shuru kar diya
 The special thing was that in this party, there were more children and minor boys and girls
 lihaaja police ne unhen giraftaar karne kii bajaay unke gharavaalon ko bulaane kaa faisla kiya
 But no one expected what happened after that
 pehle mili daant, phir mili dhakke or tab shuru hua chaanton or tamaachon kaa daur
 In fact, most of them could not control their anger when the children of these boys and girls, who arrived here on the complaint of the police, saw their children in this condition
 ab baari thi party argenisers se jawaab talabi kii
 When questioned, another shocking thing was revealed
 saaf hua ki ye party ek soshal netrvaking site par sex and smoke ke naam se khud in ladke-ladakiyon ne fiks kii thi
 And the laws and regulations found a place to smoke, in this Buzz Inn pub
 party sex or smoke kii or party karne vaale sabhi schuli bachche
 It was a new thing for the Gurgaon Police itself to witness such a party
 lihaaja, police ne in schuli bacchon ko jail bhejne kii bajaay unke gharavaalon ko usee jagah bulawaane kaa faisla kiya
 The decision was good
 par iske baad jo hua, uske bare main khud police ne bhi nahin sochaa tha
 Music and fun are everyday in this pub in Gurgaon
 lekin ravivaar kii dopaher ko yahaan achaanak police ke aa jane ke baad isaki jo kahani saamne ai, usne sirf aas-paas ke logon kaa hi nahin, balki puure dilli ensiaar kaa dhyaan apni ore khinch liya
 Because this day the party going on in this pub was no ordinary party
 balki ye party thi sex and smoke kii
 If you translate these two words directly in English, it means sex and smoke
 or sitam dekhie ki sex or smoke kii ye party karne vaale log koi balig or samajhadaar nahin, balki wo schuli bachche the, jo gharon se nikle to the padhai-likhaai ke bahaane, lekin pahunch gaye is pub ke andar, us maze kii talash main jiske bare main sochna bhi shaayad khud unke gharavaalon ke liye naammumkin tha
 The minor boys and girls attending this party going on a full afternoon were not only making a hookah smoke out of incest, but also the drinking and drinking phase was in full swing, irrespective of worldliness and rules
 khaas baat ye thi ki sex and smoke kii theme par rakhi gai is party main ladakiyon kii taadaad bhi kam nahin thi
 That is, this party was not limited to this pub, but after drinks and dance in the pub, the boys and girls attending the party were free to go to their hideout with their partners
 lekin isse pehle ki sex and smoke kaa ye theme puraa ho paata, party main police kii entry ho gai
 As soon as the news of this party running under the law was cheated, the Gurgaon Police and the Excise Department raided the pub, and then everyone was shocked to see what these laws of law showed inside
 party main saikadon schuli ladke-ladkiyaan naa sirf hukke or sharaab ke maje le rahe the, balki kai to aise bhi the, jinhen nashe kii vajah se khud apana bhi hosh nahin tha
 In such a situation, the police first asked all the boys to sit down on the dance floor and then stopped anyone from going outside
 ab maamle kii najaakat ko dekhte hue police ne is silsile main ladke-ladakiyon ke khilaaf koi mukadmaa darj karne ke badale unke gharavaalon ko khabar di
 The police had already been surprised
 lekin ab baari thi gharavaalon ke chaunkane kii
 Then, when the parents saw their children coming out of the house talking about school, college and tuition, having fun with such deception, they could not control their anger
 phir maukey par hi apane bacchon kii dhulaai shuru kar di
 The raid on this party, organized by these school students themselves through a social networking site, undoubtedly revealed the difference this time, but this raid is definitely a lesson for every family who are raising their children in this changing era and They are negligent on the issue of independence
 gudgaanv ke ek posh rihaayshi ilaake main 12 july kii raat saadhe das baje soshal netwarking site par ek schuli ladke ne sex and smoke group creat kiya
 As the name itself suggests, the purpose of creating this group was to organize a party that has the freedom of all kinds of relationships along with the fun and intoxication
 or phir dekhte hi dekhte is group ko ek nahin balki saikadon logon ne like kar liya
 But the special thing was that most of those who liked it were boys and girls between the ages of 16 and 18 who were either studying in schools or who had just enrolled in colleges
 lekin har party kii tarah sex and smoke ke liye bhi kuch niyam or sharten pehle se hi mukarrar thi
 In these terms, a fee of Rs 600 was said to bring your partner with you, bring liquor of a particular brand for yourself, come from the reference of a known person in the party and maintain its secret, that is, keep the party secret
 lekin kamaal dekhie ki is party main ladakon kii tarah naa sirf ladakiyon ne bhi puraa-puraa interest liya, balki poochtacha main ye baat bhi saaf hui ki zyaadaatar ladkiyaan is party main shaamil hone ke liye tay vaqt se kaaphi pehle hi pub main pahunch gai thim
 On the issue of serving liquor to minors in the pub, when the police asked the boy who organized the party, he said that the alcoholic boys in the party had brought a bottle of liquor with them
 magar, itnaa sab kuch hone ke baavjood sirf kamai ke chakkar main jis tarah is pub ke maalik or manager ne bacchon ko khuleam kaanoon todane kii chhot de di, wo apane-aap main ye sawaal to jarur khadey karata he ki akhir shahar ke bichon-bich koi police or excise department se itnaa bedauf kaise ho saktaa he?tamaam kaayade-kaanoonon ko thenga dikhaakar gudgaanv ke is pub main aakhir kaise chal rahi thi nashe or sex kii party? wo bhi tab jab naaballigon ko sharaab pilaanaa to dur, gudgaanv main hukka baar chalaanaa tak manaa he
 When the police tried to find the answer to this question, his hands automatically reached the pub owner and manager
 dibi city centre mal ke is pub main naunihaalon kii is sharmanaak sande party se sabaki ankhen chaundhian hui hai
 The question is arising as to how alcohol was served to more than 100 children aged 15 to 20 years
 kya pub ke maalik or manager ko is baat kii jaankaree nahin thi ki 25 saal se kam umr ke kisi bhi shaks ko sharaab pilaanaa gair kanoonee he
 And if there was information then why the children were allowed to have liquor and hookah party in the pub
 is ghatana se chaukanne hue aabkaari vibhaag ne pub ke sanchaalkon ke khilaaf chaalaanjari kar diya he
 At present a case has been registered against the pub owner and manager at DLF police station and the police has also closed the site of this pub
 is party par najar pad gai to ab hangaamaa zarur barapa he
 But in the pub, a similar Sunday party was happening every Sunday for the past one month
 jinaki jaankaree shaayad kisi ko nahin thi
 Just think, due to such unbridled pubs in many parts of the country, our coming tomorrow is not lost in the air of alcohol and smoke

 or ye ham sabake liye sikh he ki jab jindagi main tufaan aate hai to ham sab rasta nikaal hi lete hai to phir ham tufaan se darate hi kyon hai
 Gawli, who came out of a small town, formed a gang of 800 people, also used to give salary

 agar aap police files main bhi dekhen to unamem unka naam arun urf daddy likhaa he

 It is the responsibility of films to have full responsibility to avoid such content

 anjiky rahane ne lords test match ke pehle din saikadaa jadkar team india ko sammanjak sthiti main pahunchaa diya
 The biggest feature of Rahane's innings was that he once again did this amazing feat with the tail batsmen
 is match main ek vakt par team india kaa score maatr 145 ran par 7 wicket tha, bharat par behad hi kam score par olout hone kaa khatra mandara rahaa tha par rahane ne bhubaneshwar or mohammad sami ke saath milakar match kaa rukh hi badal daalaa
 This is not the first time Rahane has done this, before he contributed an unbeaten 51 and 96 runs in the first and second innings of the Durban Test on the 2013–14 tour of South Africa
 is match main bhi paristhitiyaan kuch aisi hi thim
 He fought but could not succeed in winning the match to his team
 iske baad newjiland daure ke duusare test match main rahane ne kuch aisi hi ballebaaji kii
 When he came to bat, India's score at the time was 165 for 5 wickets
 ve jab out hue tab tak team ne 9 wicket par 423 ran bana liye the
 During this, he teamed up with Kohli, Dhoni, Jadeja and Zaheer Khan to lead Team India to a strong position
 haalanki yah test match bhi dra rahaa
 Rahane scored the first century of his Test career in this match
 unhone 118 ran kii behtareen pari kheli
 Now the question arises that what is so special in this player, due to which his batting has been improving with every innings
 aakhirkaar unhone puchhlle ballebaajon ke saath batting karne ke bare kahaan se siikhaa
 Because Rahane is naturally a top order batsman
 phir 5wein yaa 6wein number par aakar puchhlle ballebaajon ke saath milakar team ko score ko aage le janaa, yah style kahaan se siikhaa? rahane kehete hai ki unhone yah kala puchhlle ballebaajon ke saath acha khilne vaale ballebaajon ko dekhakar or unase baat karke siikhaa he
 "I learned about batting with tail batsmen in the Durban Test," says Rahane
 jab main durban test kii duusari pari main 96 ran par out hua to us vakt mere dimag par centuri thi
 Lost the wicket in an attempt to get it
 lekin ab mujhe ehsaas hua ki jab aap puchhallon ke saath batting kar rahe ho to unpar vishwaas karo
 This is what i did in Wallington and then repeated it at Lords
 'rahane kehete hai, 'puchhallon ke saath ballebaaji karnaa chunauteepurn hota he
 i have watched Mike Hussey's video to understand how to bat with Tailander
 maine apni team ke khilaadiyon se bhi iske bare main baat kii
 While Virat did this in Australia, Dhoni Bhai often plays such innings
 main unase is bare main baat karata hum or isse mujhe khel ke is vibhaag main sudhaar karne kaa mauka mila he

 So, Shah and BJP leaders are well aware that in the elections where the party has secured around 50 per cent of the votes, the winning streak may slow down (ie a majority with few seats) but Will not stop
 party sutron ke mutabik, shah kaa lakshya tha ki haryana, maharashtra or jharkhand main isi saal vidhansabha chunaav hone vaale hai isliye kam se kam inamen 50 fisadi vot jarur hasil kiye jaaen, taaki agali jeet kii neenv rakhi ja sake
 Of course, they also succeeded in this
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main bhaajapa ko 35 rajyon (centre shasit pradeshon ke saath) main 17 main 50 fisadi ke aasapaas vot mili hai
 The party has managed to achieve this figure on its own in 15 states with its allies in Bihar and Maharashtra (52 and 50 per cent respectively)
 akele dam par party ko uttarakhand main 61, uttar pradesh main 49
 6, 49 in Tripura
 1, rajasthan main 58
 5, 56 in Delhi
 6 ,madhya pradesh main 58, karnataka main 51
 9, 51 in Jharkhand, 69 in Himachal, 58 in Haryana, 62 in Gujarat, 51 in Goa, 50 in Chhattisgarh
 7, chandigarh main 50
 64, and 58 percent votes in Arunachal
 in 17 rajyon se bhaajapa ko 257 or sahyogiyon ko 45 siten hasil hui hai
 BJP spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP GVL Narasimha Rao says, "not only this year but for the next three years, wherever the assembly elections are to be held, the party will get a strong majority
 yah tay he ki bahut jald hi puure desh main bhaajapa kaa vot share 50 fisad ho jayega
 Elections are to be held in major states of Bihar and Delhi next year (2020)
 2021 main pashchim bengal or phir 2022 main uttar pradesh aise pramukh rajya hai jahaan vidhansabha ke chunaav hone hai
 In these states only Bengal (40
 3 fisad) ko chhodkar baaki main bhaajapa kaa vot pratishat 50 fisadi ke aasapaas he
 However, many analysts believe that every election has its own equations and issues, so it is not necessary that the current vote percentage remains intact
 iskaa udhaaharan 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke saal bhar ke bheetar hue dilli vidhansabha ke chunaav hai jab bhaajapa kaa vot pratishat 46 se ghatakar 33 par aa gaya tha
 So, what is the reason for BJP leaders' hope of retaining such a large vote share in the current case? a senior BJP leader argues, "it is not difficult for the party because the benefits of the Modi government welfare schemes reach the people
" It is reaching the right way and the party organization is also constantly in touch with the people
 aane vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main party 50 fisad se adhik vot jarur hasil karegi
 "anil Baluni, the head of the BJP media cell, says," The BJP president Amit Shah's target of 50 per cent of the vote has been achieved in most states of the country
 jald hi duusare rajyon main bhi ham is lakshya ko paa lenge
 "A senior BJP leader says the bjp's campaign to increase its vote percentage does not stop
" andaman, assam, dadar nagar haveli, daman div, jammu-kashmir, odisha, or pashchim bengal jaise rajyon main 35 fisad se lekar 45 fisadi tak vot share bhaajapa ke paas he
 It remains to be seen how far the expectations of BJP and Amit Shah go

 As soon as the strip started running on television channels on the afternoon of 10 October that Kailash Satyarthi, the head of Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA), has been given the 2014 Nobel Prize for Peace, a happy sensation spread in the country
 aakhir yah vahi desh he jo mahatma gandhi kii hatya ke 66 saal baad bhi yah poochna nahin bhuulataa ki baapu ko nobel kyon nahin mila? yah mulk thodi tasalli amatrya sen or madar terresa ko mili nobel puraskaron se kar letaa he, lekin sen bharat se baahar rahete hai or madar bharat ke baahar paidaa hui thim, yani kuch kasar rah jaati he
 In such a situation, a 60-year-old white bearded man emerges as a Nobel Laureate
 khabar failane ke kuch hi minute ke bheetar bachapan bachaao andolan kii aadhikarik website krash kar gai, kyonki duniya ke kone-kone se log jaananaa chaahate the ki koun he satyaarthee or unhone aisa kya kiya he, jo pakistan kii mashhoor bal adhikaar kaaryakarta malala yusufajai ke saath unhen duniya kaa sabase bada puraskaar diya ja rahaa he
 Not long after the announcement, Satyarthi came out of his office in New Delhi and met the reporters waiting there
 satyaarthee ne nobel cameti kaa shukriya adaa kiya ki unhone aaj ke jamaane main lakhon bacchon kii pareshaani ko samajha he
 He said, "it is a great honor for me
 ” ve shanti ke liye nobel puraskaar paane vaale duusare bhartiya hai
 Earlier Mother Teresa received this honor in 1979
 lekin gandhivadi satyaarthee ko ab bhi ek malaal he
 If the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi had received this award, he would have been happier
 unka kahana he, “main mahatma gandhi kii maut ke baad paidaa hua tha
 If Mahatma Gandhi had received this award before me, i would have felt even more honored
 yah desh ke sabhi nagarikon kaa sammaan he
 "at the moment, Satyarthi is satisfied that the issue of child labor and trafficking has become a subject of international discussion due to the Nobel Prize
 lekin unhen yah bhi ehsaas ho gaya he ki is antarrashtriya sammaan kii vajah se unki jimmedaariyaan or bad gai hai, “is puraskaar kii vajah se bacchon ke kalyaan ke liye kaam karne kii jimmedaari bad gai he
 This is a big issue in other countries including India
 ”san 1980 main bibie kii sthapana ke baad se ab tak 80,000 bandhua bal mazdooron ko mukt kara chuke satyaarthee kii pehali pratikriya thi, “yah puraskaar mere deshavaasiyon or un lakhon bacchon ko samarpit he jinaki aawaaj pehle kabhi is desh main nahin suni gai
 When Satyarthi was talking about this, his name started trending on Twitter for the first time and well-known people from all over the world started congratulating him
 dilli bal adhikaar ayog kii laapata baccha shakha ke research or lambey samay tak bibie main kaam karne vaale deenanath chouhan satyaarthee ko kuch is tarah yaad karte hai, “unke dimag main chijen bahut saaf hoti hai
 After changing a plan, i have seen very few of them while making changes
 ” chouhan bataate hai ki bibie ke 34 saal ke itihaas main nobel puraskaar to aaj mila he lekin isse pehle satyaarthee ko lathi-danda bhi khaane pade he
 Satyarthi is believed to be the first person to popularize the issue of child labor or bonded labor in the social sphere
 prashasan ke saath behatar talmail or deshbhar main bal mazdooree kii ghatnaon kaa pataa lagane kaa bibie kaa network unki sabase badi takat bana
 On the initiative of the BBA in several factories in Delhi, the police raided and freed thousands of children from slavery
 kabhi bal mazdooree ke khilaaf ladaai main satyaarthee ke aguva rahe swami agnivesh bhi maanate hai ki satyaarthee ne is kaam ko puure tan-man se kiya
 When the award was announced, Swami Agnivesh, who was going from Delhi to Chhapra by train, said, “it is an honor for the country
 mujhe bahut khushi he
 "it is not hidden from anyone that the two had separated their paths years ago due to deep differences
 vaise madhya pradesh ke vidisha jile main 1954 main janme is saamaajik kaaryakarta ko isse pehle bhi kai bade puraskaar mili hai

 yah baat 12 november shaam 5 baje tak saaf ho gai ki supreme court dwaara 2ji maamle main nirast 122 telecom license ke liye nae sire se nilaamee flop ho gai he
 After the holiday on Diwali, 14 rounds of bidding till the second day on November 14 cost the government just Rs 9,408 crore

 dilli, mumbai, karnataka jaise aakarshak cirkil ke liye to koi boli lagane ke liye hi nahin aayaa
 Surprisingly, the mood at the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) office located at Old Minto Road in New Delhi did not seem to fade
 is nattejey se na to tri ke adhikariyon or na hi isse kuch kimi dur sthit doorsanchaar vibhaag ke unke sahakarmiyon ko koi achraj hua he
 a senior telecom department official said, "we had anticipated it
" ”is nilaamee kii yojana banane main sarkaar ke liye praathmik prerana yah thi ki ise ghotaale kii chaaya se dur rakhaa jaae
 According to the government, the best way to do this was to fix a very high reserve price, so that there is no doubt that the government wants to increase its revenue
 telecom vibhaag ke ek adhikari ne isaki pushti karte hue kaha, ‘‘isamen koi andeh nahin he ki ve apane ko kisi bhi tarah ke ghotaale kii maamuli sambhaavna se bhi bachaae rakhana chaahate the
 ”but eventually Rs 14,000 crore for All India license
 kii jo rigerv keemat (2008 main e
 Seven times the price charged by the king) was fixed and proved disastrous
 nai rigerv keemat agast, 2012 main vitt mantri pi
 It was decided by EGOM under the leadership of Chidambaram
 is baar koi ghotaalaa nahin hua, lekin sarkaar apane khajaane main rajasav badhaane main naakaam rahi
 Major telecom companies had already expressed their reluctance to bid for the auction
 kisi bhi company ne akhil bhartiya license ke liye aavedan nahin kiya tha
 Market leaders like Bharti Airtel and Vodafone bid for additional spectrum in a limited number of circles
 reliance or systema ne is nilaamee se puri tarah baahar rahanaa behatar samajha
 Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal had predicted on November 7 that the auction would be completed on the first day itself because the "reserve price is too high"
 ” haalanki nilaamee prakriya do din chali, lekin rigerv keemat ke bare main unki tippanee sahi he
 Private telecom companies are devastated by dwindling profits and rising debt burden
 pichley kareeb teen saal main lagaataar 11 timahiyon main bharti airtel ke shuddh munaafe main giravat ai he
 The root cause of the problem was the real phase of boom for the Indian telecom industry between 2004 and 2007 when the number of subscribers (connection holders) increased from 3 crore to 16
 5 karod tak pahunch gai
 During this time, profits also increased
 tri ke aankadon ke mutabik, 2004 se 2007 ke bich is udyog kaa ausat parichaalan munafa margin (abidta margin yani byaaj, tex, mulya hraas or karj chukaane se pehle kii kamai) 30 fisadi se badhkar 42 fisadi tak pahunch gaya
 During this period, interest payment and pre-tax profit (PBIT) rose from 16 per cent to 29 per cent and the rate of return on capital (ROCE) increased from 10 per cent to 28 per cent
 is daur main safalataa kii ek kunjee yah thi ki har cirkil main pratispardhaa sirf chaar-paanch companiyon ke bich simit thi
 However, it was much higher than before 2002
 isaki vajah se ek tarah kii swasth pratispardhaa bani rahi or companiyon ko acha munafa bhi hua
 When Raja took over as Telecom Minister in 2007, the scenario completely changed
 2008 main 122 nae license kaaphi kam keemat par dene ke unke nirnay se har cirkil main telecom oparator kii sankhya paanch se badhkar 13 tak pahunch gai
 This huge competition led to a huge increase in the number of customers over the next five years (16
 5 karod se 80 karod se upar) or ausat tarriff (kol daron) main bhi teji se giravat aa gai
 But it hurt the financial sector's ability to survive financially
 tri ke aankadon ke mutabik, 2007 or 2011 ke bich is sector kaa abidta margin 42 fisadi se girakar 34 fisadi hi rah gaya
 Similarly, the PBIT margin also fell from 29 per cent to 16 per cent and the return on capital fell from 28 per cent to 18 per cent
 iskaa prabhavi nateeja yah hua ki 2004 se 2007 ke bich jo kuch bhi phayda mila, vah puri tarah se gaayab ho gaya
 All this happened because the financial condition of the industry was hurt by excessive competition
 isamen is sector ko hua vah apratyaksh nuksaan shaamil nahin he jo raja ke nirnyon main ghotaale ke pahaluon kii vajah se bani anischitata kii sthiti se hua
 Not only did the profits shrink between 2008 and 2012, telecom companies also had to take heavy debt
 yah boj us samay bahut bad gaya jab sarkaar ne 2010 main 3ji spectrum kii nilaamee kii
 One lakh crores in the government coffers to the telecom industry for precious spectrum
 dene pade isse companiyaan karj ke baari boj se dab gayi
 The unfortunate thing for telecom companies is that 3G consumers have not been able to grow at the same pace as voice calls had grown for services
 swatantra doorsanchaar vishleshak ravi vishwesraiya prasad kehete hai, ‘‘telecom companiyon kii kamai main esemes sahit data sevaaon kaa yogadan 20 fisadi se bhi kam hota he
 According to Prasad, the Indian market is not yet ready for value added services
 saaf he ki mahatvakankshi telecom companiyon ne aisi seva main bahut zyada paisa laga diya jisamen unhen nikat bhavishya main bhi kuch khaas ritern miltaa nahin dikh rahaa
 Rajan Mathews, director general of the Cellular Operators Association of India (GSM operator's organization), admits that the telecom companies have made a mistake
 had kar di sarama nein sabake baavjood telecom companiyaan 2012-13 or 2013-14 main achche vittiya nateezon kii ummid kar rahi thim, lekin tri ke mukhiya je
 s
 sarama ne april, 2012 main is sector ke liye apni siforeeshon se unki ummiido par pani pher diya
 At that time, Sarma was entrusted with the task of suggesting a blueprint for auctioning only 122 canceled 2G licenses
 taarkik rup se tri ko 1800 megahterj band (jo license ke saath hi nirast kiye gaye the) main 26
 6 mhz spectrum was to be recommended for re-auction
 lekin isaki jagah usne sirf 5 megahterj kii phir se nilaamee kii sifarish kii
 Sarma created an artificial shortage of spectrum and raised the reserve price to Rs 18,000 crore
 kar diya, jise baad main ijioem ne 14,000 karod ru
 done
 sirf 5 megahterj spectrum kii nilaamee ke liye sarama ke paas ek vajah thi
 They were supposed to conserve 1800 mhz of spectrum for their proposed reintroduction (of spectrum) exercise starting in 2014
 is punarneojan prastaav ke tahat sabase pehle aae bharti airettle, vodaphone or idia jaise operataron ko apane paas philhal maujuud atyant sakasham 900 megahterj spectrum ko 2014 main license kii avadhi khatm hone ke baad khaali karnaa hoga
 Instead they will be given spectrum of less capable 1800 mhz bandwidth
 iske kuch samay baad 900 megahterj spectrum kii nilaamee oonchi keemat par kii jaaegi
 Operators like Reliance and Tata coming late in this sector will still be considered to be eligible for 900 mhz spectrum
 kam sakasham bandwidth (jiske liye zyada tower lagane jaise nae infrastracchar kii jarurat padegi) ke is ek kadam se kai oparator kii puunji laagat main baari badhat ho jaaegi
 Vodafone has estimated that it will get Rs 10,000 crore from the re-employment
 kaa atirikt nivesh karnaa hoga
 Similarly, Idea has raised Rs 17,000 crore
 ke atiriktnivesh kaa anumaan lagaaya he
 By the way, the government has slightly diluted Sarma's recommendations, saying that the old operators have 2 of 900 mhz bandwidth
 5 megahterj spectrum rakhane kii ijaajat di jaaegi
 But despite this concession, the debt burden of old telecom companies will increase further
 bhavishya kii kya ho ranneetinveenatam nilaamee kii vifaltaa se aise udyog ko thodi raahat hi mili he jisaki vittiya sehat kharaab hoti ja rahi he
 The telecom industry no longer expects much from the government

 * Tariff increase
 tri ke purv pramukh sarama ne anumaan lagaaya tha ki rigerv keemten badhaane kii unki sifarish se kol daron main sirf 2 se 3 paise prati minute kaa ijapha karnaa hoga
 But the industry estimates that call rates will have to increase to around 30 paise per minute
 sachai in donon anumaanon ke bich main kahin ho sakati he
 a senior TRAI official said, "the effect of the recommendation can be up to 8 paise per minute
 ”*kam laagat, kam pahunch vaale cirkil main nivesh karen

 maithyuj ne bataaya, ‘‘dilli, mumbai or karnataka ke liye koi boli na aane kii mukhya vajah yah he ki in cirkil main kaarobaar badaae kii sambhaavna nahin he
 The auction is only for 1800 mhz (spectrum used for voice calls), so there is no business sense in bidding for such spectrum
 is vajah se bihar or purvottar jaise cirkil ke liye zyada boliyaan ai hai
 "A senior telecom department official calls it" the strategy of the idea "
 idia cellular is ranneeti main aage rahi he ki zyada pair failaane kii jagah pehle kisi rajya (jaise maharashtra) ke bilkul aantarik ilaakon tak gahari paith banaai jaae taaki ek jagah par zyada se zyada upabhoktaaon ko khinchaa ja sake

 har cricket vishwacap main ek team aisi jarur hoti he jo ulatpher karne ke liye mashhoor hoti he
 This time the team was considered to be Afghanistan
 jab vishwacap ke lig match shuru hone se pehle gulabadin naeeb kii is team ne abhyaas match main pakistan ko haraaya to is kayaas ko or bhi bal mila ki afghanistan jarur koi bada dhamaakaa karegi
 However, Afghanistan did not get any special success in the World Cup but in the match between India on 22 June and Pakistan on 29 June, Afghanistan showed how much power they had in the game
 aaj afghanistan kii team bhale hi duniya kii top tiimon ke khilaaf khel rahi ho lekin uskaa ye safar itnaa aasaan nahin rahaa he
 The journey of Afghanistan in world cricket is the story of struggle that inspires many to dream
 afghanistan kaa cricket kii duniya main aagaaz1979 main jab soviet tanks afghanistan main ghuse, to raashid khan kaa parivaar un 30 lakh se adhik logon main se ek tha jo seemaa paar bhaag gaye the
 He learned leg-spin bowling at the refugee camps in the Pakistani city of Peshawar
 yun to afghanistan cricket board kaa gathan 1995 main hi hua tha lekin talibani shashan ke chalate team par bain laga diya gaya
 The manner in which the Afghanistan team's players kept the fire of cricket alive and faced hardships amidst the Taliban's radical ideology and an atmosphere of violence is less appreciated
 talibani shashan ke dauraan afghanistan main chaaron taraf goliyon or bamon kii barish ho rahi thi, taliban logon kaa katleam jaanwaron kii tarah kar rahaa tha, aise main taliban kii naak ke neeche cricket jaise khel ko jari rakhana kisi maut ke khel se kam nahin tha
 Things had become so bad that the players did not even have a place to practice
 lekin kehete hai na 'aksar buland hausalon ke saamne kamyaabi ghutane tech hi diya karti hai
 'afghanistan players continue their practice in refugee camps
 afghanistan kii madad ke liye anya desh bhi khulkar aage aae
 The British Government and the Asian Cricket Council financially supported the Afghanistan team
 afghanistan ke buland hausale ko dekhte hue srilanka, pakistan or bharat ne bhi madad kaa haath aage badhaayaa
 The Indian Cricket Board helped build stadiums in Kandahar and mazar-e-sharif, Afghanistan
 yahi nahin, bharat ne afghanistan kii team ko abhyaas karne ke liye bharat main stadium bhi muhaiyaa karaayaa
 By all odds, Afghanistan's national team was ready by 2000
 afghanistan ke rifuji camp se lekar celibrity life tak kii ye kahani logon ko aakarshith karti he or prerit bhi
 And then came the period when the Afghanistan team forced all international teams to consider them as their rivals
 ab baat karte hai june 2017 kii, jab afghanistan apane kariyar kaa doosraa test cricket match khel rahaa tha
 Afghanistan had no idea that this match was going to connect with the pages of their history
 ye afghanistan kii test cricket match main pehali jeet thi
 The match was being played against Ireland in Dehradun in which Afghanistan defeated Ireland by 7 wickets and achieved the status of Test cricketers
 is test match ke baad se kai afghanistani khilaadi charchaa kaa centre ban gaye
 In the same way, Afghanistan players Rashid Khan, Mujib ur Rehman and Mohammad Nabi, who also managed to take full advantage of a platform like IPL, remained in the headlines, due to which not only made their identity all over the world but also brightened the name of their country

 raashid khan ne ye bhi bataaya tha ki ipiel kaa anubhav kisi bhi anya lig ke mukaable kaaphi alag tha
 Playing with the best players in the world and practicing under the supervision of experienced professionals, and most of all, the overcrowded crowd of fans and the love that comes from them fills a wave of passion
 agar aap kii team main sabhi achche khilaadi hon to aap khud-ba-khud acha pradarshan karne kii koshish karte hai
 Nobody had ever thought that the team on which the Taliban had banned a time, that team will be successful in earning so much name in the whole world
 yahi nahin raashid khan afghanistan ke sabase lokapriy cricketer hai
 This 20-year-old player is counted among the best bowlers in the world
 cricket kii duniya main afghanistan ko abhi lanbaa safar tay karnaa he

 yun to sardi aate hi logon main aalasapan dikhnaa laazmi he
 Everyone, small or big, does not feel like reading during winter
 or to or duusari taraf exam kaa silsilaa shuru hota he to yah aalasapan doguna ho jaataa he
 We are telling you some tips, with the help of which you can easily read in the winter like ordinary days: 1
 garm kapade pahan kar padhai karen:sardi aa chuki he, aise main aapako padhate samay apane sehat kaa khaas khyaal rakhana chahie
 While studying you should make a distance from the blanket so that you can keep focus on the study
 iske liye garm kapade ko pahan len or haa mojey or garm topi kaa istemaal jarur karen
 Keep in mind that do not wear too much clothes, which increases the burden on your body and makes you tired and sleep
 2
 Do not sit down and study: In the winter season, it is often seen that students prefer to study late to keep themselves comfortable
 aisa karne kii vajah se aapmen aalasapan badhegaa or neend aa jaaegi
 To avoid this, you should study in a chair or on a bed
 3
 Do not read continuously, keep taking short breaks
 Continuous reading for hours increases fatigue and also makes you feel boring
 koshish karen aadhe-aadhe ghante par uthakar thodaa gum len
 With this you will feel fresh and will be able to read again with full energy
 4
 Take special care of food and drink: If it is winter, then you will also want to eat hot and hot
 ghar main he to or bhi man karata hoga
 In such a situation, try not to eat food in large quantities
 agar aap aisa karte hai to aapako neend aegi or aap apane study par focus nahin kar paaenge
 5
 garm peya len:khud ko charge rakhane ke liye chaay, coffee padhane ke dauraan le sakate hai
 If you do not drink both of the tea and coffee, then there is nothing to worry, you can drink hot milk, which will also prove to be very good for health
 6
 Take special care of the routine: If the exam is on the head, then make a routine for yourself
 aalas ko tyaag den or koshish karen ki subah kaa samay apane padhai ko jarur de
 According to elders, morning is considered the best for studying
 iske alaava is samay aap jo bhi yaad karenge wo exam main bhuulane kii gunjaaish bhi kam rahegi
 7
 jagah kaa chunaav karen:aap padhane ke liye aise jagah kaa chunaav kar sakate hai jahaan aapako dhoop milen
 For this, take the one you need in a bag and on the terrace of your house, on the balcony, in the park or in a place where you get easy sunlight
 in tareekon ko aajamaa kar aap na sirf apane study par dhyaan de sakate hai balki apane padhai karne ke tareekon main kaaphi rochakata laa sakate hai jisase aapkaa padhane main man lagegaa
 8
 khel bhi jaruri he:agar aap yah sochate hai ki exam ke samay khilne se aapkaa time barbaad hoga to aap galat hai
 You can keep yourself in charge by playing badminton, chase to refresh yourself
 9
 Read in library: School - It is easier to study in college library
 isaki khaas vajah vahaan ko maahaul hota he
 If students are seen studying near you, then you will not feel sleepy, but a sense of competition will increase
 10
 Group study is also a good option: sitting in groups with your friends on the roof of the house or studying in the park can be a good option
 aisa karne se padhai main to man lagegaa hi saath hi ek disha milegi or padhai main hone vaale kanfusion ko bhi apane doston ke saath charchaa kar dur kar sakenge

 Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge says that the paramilitary forces were raided
 chaar kamaron se vidhayakon ko baahar nikaal kar poochtacha kii gai

 yah to sochi hui saazish or jang he
 The dictatorship is taking place to defeat Ahmed Patel in any way
 ye to coparative federlism nahin he
 This is a conference strategy
 jairam ne pradhanmantri modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki desh ke saamne itani chunauti he, par piem to sirf gujarat main vyast hai
 The attack on the federal structure proves that the BJP is above the Constitution

 Every thought comes in mind
 
 
 achche bure, chote bade
 But not everyone has the skill to give alphas to any idea, and the skill is such that anyone who listens or reads it will start to feel that alphas themselves
 un alphaajon main chupe jajbaat se wo is kadar jude maano wo kahana chahta ho ki uske dil kaa khyaal isse juda ho hi nahin saktaa
 This attempt of Rupesh Kashyap or even to say that such a beautiful example is his poetry collection Algoja
 jisamen unhone sabase pehla kaam to yahi kiya ki kavita kii reeti or rivaaj ko darkinar kar diya
 Rupesh Kashyap gave his feelings in a very beautiful way in the same way that Alfaaz would be flashed in his mind, which means that it is impossible to say that he has not done any dishonesty with his figures and alphabets
 badi hi eemaandaaree se jo sochaa use kaagaj par darj kar diya
 The significance of his poems makes the poem even more interesting, the many commentaries of poet Ashok Chakradhar in which he appears to relate himself and his own compositions to the poems of Rupesh
 ek kisse kaa zikr karke yahaan bhi kavi ke haq main hi ashok chakradhar ne gavaahi di he ki kis tarah rupesh kashyap ne kavitaaon kii taazgi se na sirf unka dil jeeta balki unhen majaboor kar diya ki ek naerchanakarco phone karke use badhai se labarej kar diya jaae
 a testimony came to the fore, which is also important to mention because no skill may need a particular area
 balki aamtaur par yahi dekha jaataa he ki hunar unheen ilaakon kii paidaavaar hota he
 The area about which people probably assume what will come from here
 lekin ek baat jo akharati he ki kuch kavitaaon ko padhane ke baad uske adhure hone kaa ahsaas hone lagata he
 It is felt that the matter which the poet tried to raise, the strength and the mind with which he showed it to be compelled, why it was considered appropriate to leave the matter suddenly
 masalan, neend aati nahin
 
 
 It is not even started in the poem that it is over
 aisa laga ki abhi kuch or bhi he jise shaayad alphaajon kii darkaar he
 But this thing makes the end of the filter feel like a knocking, like one of his poems is T-20, here he wrote T-20 ie tea and connected it to the clock which is obsessed in people's minds these days
 Is moving around lekin use mulk ke ek bandobast par kataaksh karte hue achaanak yun roak dena bhi thodaa akhar gaya
 Because here he was expecting the poet that he could attack this settlement with something which is often silenced by both the pen and the tongue
 lekin tarif kerani hogi hindi yugma kii jinhone rupesh kashyap ke is kavy ko kitaab kii shakl di or is kitaab algoza kaa mukhyaprishth vaaki kamaal he, kyonki usamen jis tarah se do bansuri ke vaadya ko darshaya gaya he
 Perhaps the same belief is being held about him that this instrument is now lost in history
 jitna surila ye vaadya dekhne main lagata he
 While repeating the poems of Rupesh Kashyap, it is imperative that it be meaningful
 ye baat yahaan kahana galat nahin hoga ki unke jivan ke tamaam tajurbon kaa hi nahin, balki apane anubhavon se aage kii dastaan darj karne main rupesh kashyap kaamyaab rahe hai

 Not only this, Pooja also loves to cook for her loved ones in free time
 puja kaa yah bhi kahana he ki unki ichha tivi par kisi kukri kii jaj banane kii he
 He said that the level of cooking-based programs in the country has improved significantly
 puja kaa maananaa he ki bhojan ko filmana ek kala he, jisase bhartiya televijan jagat puri tarah parichit nahin he
 He said, 'I love watching cookery shows
 main khaanaa or khilaanaa pasand he
 i love the fragrance coming from the kitchen
 yadi mujhe tivi par kabhi kukri sho kaa jaj banane kaa mauka mila, to jarur karuungi
 'the Indian television industry has made considerable progress over time, especially in the area of culinary programs
 ab tivi par pratispardhaatmak kaarykram bhi aate hai, lekin puja kaa kahana he ki ab bhi bhartiya televijan jagat ko kukri sho ke kshetra main kaaphi kuch seekhney kii jarurat he
 Pooja said, 'for example you compare' Master Chef Australia 'and' Master Chef India '
 videshon main bhojan ko kaise filmaaya jaataa he, yah ek kala he
 Pooja came to the capital to join the Hyatt Hotel at the Hyatt Hotel in New Delhi in 2014 as a judge
 unhone paak-kala or vyanjanon se sambandhit kaaphi sari baaten saajha kin
 Pooja said that instead of avoiding eating and drinking for fear of gaining weight, she likes to eat her favorite things wholeheartedly
 puja kaa kahana he ki sahi khan-paan ke kaaran hi vah urjavan rahati hai
 Pooja said, 'I am the film director and producer
 mujhe set par sabakuch sanbhaalanaa hota he, mujhe teji se kaam karnaa or khud ko majboot banaakar rakhana hota he
 So if i stay hungry, my mood worsens
 'IANS se input When a large industry is in crisis, the help given to it is called incentive and when the same assistance is given to the farmers, it is called subsidy
 aisi bhedbhaav vaali maansikta kyon he?” pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jab 31 janvari ko bijepi ke kisaan morche ke pratinidhiyon se 7 rescorse road sthit apane awaas par yah baat kahi, to yah sarkaar kii us soch main aae badlaav ko ingit kar rahaa tha, jiskaa dansh unhone bhoomi adhigrahan adhyadesh ko lekar 8 maheene tak jhela
 The opposition as well as organizations associated with the Sangh Parivar had also opened a public front against the Modi government, which led to the government being accused of being anti-farmer and pro-industrialist
 lekin us daur se baahar nikalakar darjan bhar kisaan hitaishi yojanaon ko pitare main daal kisaanon ko lubhaane ke safar par nikali bijepi kya 2019 ke aam chunaav se pehle apni chunavi jameen ko upjau bana paaegi?29 farvari ko pesh hone vaale aam bajet se thik pehle pradhanmantri khud desh ke chaar rajyon main kisaan raily ko sambodhit karne ja rahe hai
 On the changed strategy of the government, Sanjay Kumar, director of the Center for the Study of Developing Societies, says, "notions have a big role in politics
 isamen koi andeh nahin ki bhoomi adhigrahan adhyadesh ke samay modi sarkaar kii chhavi pro-korporate ban gai thi, lekin jab vakt ke saath sthiti saamaanya hui to sarkaar ke liye jaruri tha ki vah apni chhavi badale
 Therefore, the government is focusing on the aspects related to the farmer
 ” lekin sawaal he ki bijepi ko isaki jarurat us vakt kyon mahasoos hui, jab modi sarkaar ke do saal puure ho rahe hai?kyon yaad aae kisaan?darasal modi sarkaar kii zyaadaatar mahatvakankshi yojanaayen us tarah sire chadh nahin pain, jaisi use ummid thi

 are looking golden on paper, but its ground reality looks like something else
 bijepi ke ek netaa kehete hai ki is tarah aankadon se vot hasil nahin kiye ja sakate
 The Prime Minister himself was concerned with such reports
 isliye jab unhone janvari se har maheene kii aakhri buudhvaar ko mantrimandaleey samooh kii baithak main samiksha kaa faisla kiya to sabase pehle krishi kaa hi mudda liya
 The presentation prepared by the Group of Secretaries was shown in the cabinet meeting held on 27 January
 isamen mantrimandaleey samooh ko teen hisson-krishi or usase jude vibhaag, infrastracchar or usase jude vibhaag, soshal or kor sectors-main baanta gaya he
 This presentation showed that a total of 548 cabinet decisions were made in the government from May 2014 to December 2015, of which 89 did not materialize
 isi tarah aarthik maamalon kii cabinet cameti ke 182 main se 82 faislon par abhi amal nahin hua he
 In this meeting, the government adopted a new approach to implement those schemes in future, whose activity should start on the ground
 bijepi ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 2009 ke mukaable teen guni zyada siten akele gramin kshetron se hi jeetin
 But the way the BJP lost the elections in Bihar, and farmer suicides started happening in areas where it was not expected, the way pulses rose and the disappointment of the government in the rural areas, all these things increased the bjp's concern
 Granted
 iske alaava 2018 tak pashchim bengal, assam, punjab, uttar pradesh samet darjan bhar rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav bhi hone hai, jahaan kisaan ahm bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai
 Therefore, the BJP gave priority to the issue of farmers as part of the strategy, so that the impact on the land starts
 sutron ke mutabik, mantrimandaleey samooh kii baithak main rajyamantri manoj sinha or sanjeev baalion ne kaha ki sarkaar ke jo bhi faisle ho rahe hai use jameen par laane main vakt lagegaa, to pradhanmantri ne naaraazgi jaahir karte hue kaha ki sakaaratmak drushtikon se aage bade to kaam kiya ja saktaa he
 According to sources, BJP President Amit Shah has advocated to save the money saved by the reduction in petrol prices on social concerns and especially on villages so that before the general elections of 2019, work on the ground will be seen in the same way as UPA-1

 The Modi government issued an ordinance on December 29, 2014, to reform the Land Acquisition Act, within seven months of taking a false look at changing the image
 lekin teen baar adhyadesh laane ke baad bhi use sansad main paarit nahin kara saki or aakhirkaar 30 agast 2015 ko modi ne radio program man kii baat main baari man se kaha, “ham kisaanon ke hit main adhyadesh lekar aae the, lekin bhram failaayaa gaya, kisaanon ko bhaybheet kiya gaya, par main chahta hum ki meraa kisaan bhramit na ho or bhaybheet to kadaapi nahin hona chahie
 That is why i am restoring the old position on land acquisition

 Therefore, the government is considering increasing the budget on social concerns

 But at the completion of its 10 years, the government over-organized programs and tried to take credit for advancing it

 It also mentions the steps taken by the BJP ruled states in the interest of farmers
 bijepi kisaan morche ke rashtriya adhyaksh vijaypal singh tomars kehete hai, “jahaan hamaari sarkaar he vahaan kisaan chaoupal, yatra, sabhi ke jariye modi sarkaar kii ore se krishi kshetra main uthaae gaye kadamon ko bataaya jayega par jahaan gaiyr bijepi sarkarein he vahaan andolanaatmak rukh hoga or rajya sarkaar ke nikammepan par dharna-gheraav ke kaarykram kiye jaaenge

 “their demand is that if the government forgives the corporate, five and a half thousand crores
 kii protsaahan raashi main se thodaa paisa bhi vasuul le to kisaanon kaa bhala ho jaae
 But it is unfortunate that MNREGA, agriculture, including everyone, is being spent on 4-5 percent of the total budget
 ab tak kisaanon ko praathamikta na die jane or bhoomi adhigrahan adhyadesh ko lekar mahajan kaa kahana he, “piem kii niyat par andeh nahin he
 But around the circle of policy directors (NITI Aayog and pm's Economic Advisor), there are people who have never seen the village

 a scheme like crop insurance is beneficial for the farmers and laborers
 ”modi sarkaar kii kisaan hitaishi pahal ko kisaanon se jude sanghathan der se hi lekin durust maan rahe hai
 But its success will be seen only when the farmers get a direct benefit on the land because smooth things have always been happening in electoral terms

 " unhone kaha, "ham is jang main apane yogadan kaa zikr karte hai to phacist takaton ko bura lagata he
 If we say that we will protect the borders of the country, then we are also denied the status of martyrdom
 " Azam asserted that the dream of a healthy and prosperous India would not be realized until a mutual brotherhood was born among Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs
 unhone kaha ki musalamaanon ke dilon main khauf paidaa karnaa or yah sabit karne par majaboor karnaa ki vah bhi dusron kii tarah deshbhakt hai yah ek swasth baat nahin he
 It is the misfortune of the Muslims of the country that they have to give clarification about their patriotism, which the fascists are responsible for

 Here he raised the demand for raising the income tax exemption limit from 2 lakh to 5 lakh
 unhone kaha, 'isse 3 karod se bhi zyada logon ko phayda hoga'
 At present, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has also released the last full budget of Modi government, but in these four years he did not fulfill the demand raised by himself
 nateeja ye hua ki tex ke morche par bhi aam aadmi ko in chaar saalon ke dauraan koi khaas raahat nahin mili he
 First Budget First Changes: When Finance Minister Arun Jaitley presented his government's first budget in July 2014, he made changes in the tax slab during this period

 )2015 main koi badlaav nahinvitt mantri ne vitt varsh 2015 ke bajet main inakam tex slab main koi badlaav nahin kiya
 During this time, they have increased the surcharge on income of more than 1 crore people by 2%
 iske baad pehle jo sarcharge 10 fisadi tha, vah 12 fisadi ho gaya
 Reduced tax liability: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley did not change the income tax slab even while presenting the budget for the financial year 2016-17
 haalanki yahaan aam aadmi ko raahat dene ke liye 2
 The 10 per cent tax on income of Rs 5 lakh was reduced to 5 per cent

 Total income to take advantage of it3

 This time too, the income tax exemption limit remains the same: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley presented the budget for the financial year 2018-19 in February
 isamen bhi tex slab main koi badlaav nahin kiya gaya
 This time from the experts to the common man, they were hoping that the income tax exemption limit was 2
 5 lakh se badhaakar 3 lakh yaa 5 lakh ho sakati he
 But nothing like this happened
 arun jetali iskar chhot kii seemaa ko jas kaa tas rakhaa

 In the budget, a standard deduction of 40 thousand rupees was announced
 haalanki isse aam aadmi ko koi badi raahat nahin mili
 There was no change in the income tax slab even in the last full budget of Modi government
 ab dekhnaa yah hoga ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad jo sarkaar chunakar aati he, vah is morche par kya kadam uthaati he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has a strong majority in Uttar Pradesh
 vidhansabha chunaav main utarane se pehle or prachaar ke dauraan bhaajapa ne upra kii janata se kai mahatvapurn vaade kiye the
 These promises should not remain as mere 'jumle', it will be a challenge of the new government
 raajnneetik vishleshkon kii maane to bhaajapa sarkaar ke saamne ab un vaadon ko puraa karne kii chunauti rahegi, jo party or pradhanmantri ne upra kii janata se kiye the
 During the UP elections, many sensitive issues were also given ventures by the BJP
 in muddon ko lekar bade-bade daawey centre kii bhaajapa sarkaar kii taraf se kiye gaye
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had stressed in many of his public meetings that after the formation of BJP government in UP, the debt of small and marginal farmers will be waived in the first meeting of the cabinet
 pradhanmantri ke is vaade par bhi sabaki nazren rahengi ki cabinet kii pehali baithak main kisaanon ko kya-kya miltaa he
 At the same time, he also said that as a member of Uttar Pradesh, he will personally monitor whether the UP government is doing good or not
 iske alaava pradhanmantri ne chunaav ke bich main hi 'shmashaan or kabristaan' kaa mudda bhi uthaaya tha
 He had accused the SP government that the government was providing sufficient funds for the boundary wall of the cemetery, but was not providing any facilities for the crematorium
 upra main sarkaar banane ke baad shmashaan or kabristaan ko lekar bhaajapa kaa kya rukh rahata he, yah bhi dekhnaa kaaphi dilachasp hoga
 On these statements of Modi, former BBC journalist and 'north Block South Block' editor Durgesh Upadhyay said during a conversation with IANS that after the formation of the government there will be pressure on the government to fulfill its promises
 upaadhyaay ne kaha, "upra main bhaajapa kii purna bahumat kii sarkaar banane ke baad anti-romeo team, kisaanon kii karjamaafee or bundelkhand ke vikaas kaa mudda to rahegaa hi, saath main bhaajapa ko upra main kanoon vyavastha ko lekar bhi kaaphi kaam karnaa hoga
 The BJP has always surrounded the SP on this issue, so it will now have to answer to the public on these issues
 " He said, however, that there is a possibility that Prime Minister Modi will keep an eye on the government of Uttar Pradesh, because before the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, many promises will have to be fulfilled here, because in the election all parties will also ask for their accounts
 upra main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne baar-baar yah mudda uthaaya tha ki upra main college or skulon ke baahar ho rahi chhedhkhani ko rokane ke liye anti-romeo team banaai jaaegi
 The BJP also gave a lot of air to the issue of triple talaq in this election
 party ne kaha tha ki is mudde ko lekar vah supreme court jaaegi, taaki muslim mahilaon ko teen talaak se chhutkaaraa mil sake
 Political analysts, however, believe that the BJP has done well in the Muslim-dominated areas of Uttar Pradesh
 isse aisa lag rahaa he ki loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bhaajapa is mudde ko or dhar degi, taaki iskaa raajnneetik laabh liya ja sake
 The BJP had, in its election resolution, talked about the formation of the Bundelkhand Development Board and Purvanchal Development Board after forming the government
 purna bahumat kii sarkaar banane ke baad iskaa gathan kar un ilaakon ke vikaas kaa bhi dabaav hoga
 In the assembly elections, where the BJP has captured all 19 seats in Bundelkhand, it has also performed very well in Purvanchal
 ab bhaajapa kii sarkaar par in kshetron main vikaas karaane kaa dabaav hoga
 The comments varisht patrkaar or raajnneetik vishleshak vijay shankar pankaj ne kaha, "vaaki yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki upra kii bhaajapa sarkaar in samvedansheel muddon ko lekar kya rukh apanaati he
 This government will not have any excuse now
 centre main unki sarkaar he
 If the UP government wants to, then now the development of Purvanchal and Bundelkhand can be done
 " unhone kaha, "ab tak kii sarkarein yahi ronaa roti rahi hai ki centre sarkaar madad nahin kar rahi he
 But now there will be BJP government both at the center and the state
 lihaaja, ab yah bahaanaa bhi nahin chalegaa
 "BJP is accepting these issues as a challenge
 bhaajapa ke pradesh pravaktaa manish shukla ne kaha, "janata ne jis ummid ke saath upra main bhaajapa ko sarkaar banane kaa mauka diya he, ham us par khara utrenge
 Every promise made to the public will be fulfilled
 "(is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Everyone will keep an eye on the Prime Minister's promise that what the farmers get in the first meeting of the cabinet
 saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki upra kaa saansad hone ke naate vah is baat kii khud nigaraanee karenge ki upra kii sarkaar acha kaam kar rahi he yaa nahin
 Apart from this, the Prime Minister had also raised the issue of 'cremation and graveyard' in the midst of elections
 sapa kii sarkaar par unhone yah aarope lagaaya tha ki sarkaar kabristaan kii chaharadivari ke liye paryaapt dhan to de rahi he, lekin shmashaan ke liye vah koi suvidha nahin de rahi he
 After the formation of the government in UP, what will be the attitude of the BJP regarding the crematorium and the cemetery, it will also be very interesting to see
 modi ke in bayanon ko lekar bibisi ke purv patrkaar or 'north block south block' ke sampadak durgesh upaadhyaay ne ieenes se baatcheet ke dauraan kaha ki sarkaar ke gathan ke baad vaaki sarkaar par apane vaadon ko puraa karne kaa dabaav hoga
 Upadhyay said, "after the formation of bjp's absolute majority government in UP, the issue of anti-romeo team, loan waiver of farmers and development of Bundelkhand will be there, along with the BJP will have to work a lot on law and order in UP
 bhaajapa hameshaa se is mudde ko lekar sapa ko gherti rahi he, lihaaja use ab in muddon par janata ko jawaab dena hoga
 " unhone kaha ki haalanki ek sambhaavna yah bhi he ki pradhanmantri modi kii najar upra kii sarkaar par rahegi, kyonki varsh 2019 main loksabhaa chunaav se pehle yahaan kai vaade puure karne honge, kyonki chunaav main sabhi dal unase bhi hisaab maangenge
 During the election campaign in UP, BJP national president Amit Shah had repeatedly raised the issue that an anti-romeo team would be formed to prevent tampering outside colleges and schools in UP
 bhaajapa ne is chunaav main teen talaak ke mudde ko bhi kaaphi hawa di thi
 The party had said that it would go to the Supreme Court on this issue so that Muslim women could get rid of the triple talaq
 raajnneetik vishleshak haalanki yah maan rahe hai ki upra main muslim bahul ilaakon main bhi bhaajapa ne kaaphi acha pradarshan kiya he
 From this it seems that before the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP will give more edge to this issue so that its political benefits can be taken
 bhaajapa ne apane chunavi sankalpapatr main sarkaar banane ke baad bundelkhand vikaas board or purvachal vikaas board ke gathan kii baat kahi thi
 After the formation of an absolute majority government, there will be pressure to develop those areas
 vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ne jahaan bundelkhand kii sabhi 19 siton par kabja jamaaya he, vahiin purvachal main bhi usne kaaphi shandaar pradarshan kiya he
 Now the BJP government will be under pressure to get development in these areas
 tippaniyan Senior journalist and political analyst Vijay Shankar Pankaj said, "it will be really interesting to see what attitude the BJP government of UP takes on these sensitive issues
 is sarkaar ke paas ab koi bahaanaa bhi nahin hoga
 He has a government at the center
 upra sarkaar yadi chaahegi to vaaki ab purvachal or bundelkhand kaa vikaas ho saktaa he
 "he said," The governments so far have been crying that the central government is not helping
 lekin ab centre or rajya donon jagah bhaajapa kii sarkaar hogi
 So, now this excuse will not work
 " bhaajapa in muddon ko chunauti ke rup main sweekaar kar rahi he
 BJP State Spokesperson Manish Shukla said, "with the hope that the people have given the BJP a chance to form the government in UP, we will live up to it
 janata se kiya gaya har vaada puraa kiya jayega

 According to GRP Thanadikari (kota) Sanjay Sharma, accused Gaurav was traveling with his wife and two children

 raipur ke navnirmit shahid vir narayan singh antarrashtriya cricket stadium main buudhvaar ko tii20 lig ke 44wein mukaable main maujuuda champion kolkata kaa saamana dilli team ke saath hoga
 Kolkata had defeated Delhi in the opening match of this T20 season and since then this team has deviated from the rhythm so far that it has been able to win only 2 wins in 9 matches
 pune par mili antim jeet ke saath vah phiseddi team se aathven kram par pahunchi he
 Playing under the leadership of Mahela Jayawardene, the team won Pune in the only T20 match ever played at the Veer Narayan Stadium
 ab jabaki buudhvaar ko uskaa saamana kolkata ke saath hona he, vah jeet kaa kram jari rakhte hue kolkata ke saath hisaab baraabar karnaa chaahegi
 Delhi's performance against Pune was not very commendable
 pune team yah match jeet sakati thi lekin apane ballebaajon kii naakaami ke kaaran vah 15 ran peeche rah gai
 Delhi strategists also know very well that they have won because of Pune's weakness, not because of their own strength
 aise main dilli team ko apni ranneeti par vichaar ke saath-saath apane senior khilaadiyon kaa saath chahie hoga, jo lagaataar naakaam rahe hai
 Except for David Warner, no one has performed consistently
 sahvaag ne mumbai ke khilaaf jeet main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi lekin uske baad phir unka balla khamosh ho gaya he
 Strategists from Delhi and Kolkata must be thinking that there is a lack of consistency in the performance of both teams and they would like to take advantage of this
 maujuuda champion hone ke baavjood kolkata ab tak 9 main se 3 match hi jeet sake hai or chah main unki haar hui he

 bhartiya mul ke ek vaigyanik ke netritv main anusandhankartaaon ne darjan bhar se adhik aise jeenon kii pahchaan kii he, jinka sambandh hriday kii beemaari se he
 An international team led by Prof

 vaigyanikon ne hriday kii beemaari se sambandh rakhane vaale 13 nae jeenon kii pahchaan kii
 This number is twice the number of known genes associated with heart attacks so far

 daily telegraph main unhen yah kehete hue uddhrut kiya gaya he, ab ham adhyayan karenge ki ye jin kaise kaam karte hai
 Surely then we will be able to find out how this disease occurs and how it can be treated
 har din sochataa hum ki ab naukari series band kar den
 Because the selection commissions across the country are acting like a gang
 unhone naujavaanon ko is kadar lutaa he ki aaf chaah kar bhi sabaki kahani nahin dikhaa sakate hai
 Many crores are taken from the youth to fill the form, but the examination is not known
 desh main koi bhi khabar hoti he, ye noujvaan din raat apni naukari ko lekar hi massej karte rahete hai
 When will i show my job, my exam
 pariksha dekar noujvaan ek saal se lekar teen saal tak intazaar kar rahe hai to kai baar form bharne ke baad chaar tak pariksha kaa pataa hi nahin chalata he
 This series is necessary to close because the problem has become acute
 jab bhi band karne kii sochataa hum kisi noujvaan kii kahani sunakar kaanp jaataa hum
 Then it seems that today we show for one more time and then do not stop the series
 aaj kii kahani main ek kisse se shuru karata hum
 i am not sure if this will be right but you first listen
 shankar east dilli main rahata he
 There are pictures of his house and locality so that you can also see the Hindustan from where youngsters like Shankar spend their lives preparing for government jobs
 shankar ne 2013 main ardinance factory kanpur ke liye form bharaa tha
 100 labor was to be restored, whose total salary is around 20,000
 1 june 2014 ko likhit pariksha di jiskaa riselt aa gaya 6 june 2014 ko
 Physical and medical examination took place on 16 and 17 June 2014
 police jaanch ke form bharne ko die gaye
 After that a letter comes that there is something wrong in the identity of some candidates, which will be forensic examined
 ye log forensik jaanch ke liye pahunch gaye magar disambar 2014 se lekar agast 2018 aa gaya
 They were not called for joining
 shankar kaa daawa he ki kisi ko nahin bulaayaa gaya
 He kept waiting for four years after passing the exam
 shankar ne apane saathi kii madad se recording bheji he
 Now you have a question
 kya shankar jaise naujavaanon ke saath jo hua wo sahi tha
 The advertisement for this exam was released in March 2013
 2014 tak in logon ne pariksha paas kar, jaanch vagairah kii sari prakriya puri kar lee phir uske chaar saal tak kuch sugabugahat nahin
 After that comes the order of the Ordnance Factory under the Ministry of Defense that the advertisement which was started in March 2013, under which the process of appointment of 100 Labor was started is canceled altogether
 is par adishnal general menager ke dastakhat hai
 After four years, the process of appointing him was canceled
 is pariksha ke liye in naujavaanon ne 50 rupee form ke bhare the
 He also went to the water
 chaar saal tak pariksha kaa ata pataa nahin ek din kaha jaataa he ki jo bhi prakriya shuru hui thi wo radd kii jaati he
 The reason for one line is stated
 prime time television ke liye yah sab mudda nahin he
 At this moment, the issue of theme and theory remains on TV like who is in front of Modi in 2019
 teen murti main kis kis kii murti honi chahie
 There is a lot of debate on all these issues
 theme or theory vaale taapic par bade bade jaankaar aate hai, gyaan baghaarte hai
 Here the youth are behind my life, why don't you show what is happening to us
 jo mudda aaj ke naujavaanon ke saamne khadaa he, us par koi bahes kyon nahin he
 Is not
 shankar ne apane bayaan main ek or baat kahi
 In 2016, he again filled the form for the Ordnance Factory
 teen batch main pariksha honi thi
 One batch examination took place but then the same order came that the remaining two batches are canceled
 2013 se 2018 aa gaya, shankar berojgaar he
 We have seen many times during the job series that the exam takes place and in the end is canceled for some reason and then it is not known when it will happen again, sometimes it does not happen again
 bharat ke lakhon noujvaan sarkari naukari kii pariksha main lage hai
 Some are preparing for Railways, some are banking and some are SSC
 kyonki in naukariyon kii bhartee kii ek sankhya hoti he
 Students know how many seats have been won
 use yah kabhi pataa nahin chalata he ki privet sector main kab or kahaan kitni seat ai he
 Very few of those who have lost jobs since the recession and demonetisation have found work again
 naukari nahin he iske kai aankade samay samay par aate rahete hai
 Recently, the Employees Provident Fund Organization, in a review of its data, found that 46 lakh people had lost their jobs in the last ten months or they could not find work again
 aisa nahin he ki naukari nahi he
 The number of private sector jobs may not be known, but government jobs account for a lot
 haal hi main sansad main die gaye bayanon ke hisaab se sarkaar ke paas 24 lakh naukariyaan hai
 American journalist Steven Brill has written a book called Telespin
 is kitaab main unhone likhaa he ki america main sarkari naukariyon main bhartee kii prakriya bahut lambii or jatil he
 Do you know how long it takes to get there, Steven Brill is angry
 maatr 90 din
 Restoration of government jobs in India takes four years
 ham iskaa zikr isliye bhi kar rahe hai, kyonki sanjay kumaar or pranav gupta ne mint akhbaar main ek lekh likhaa he
 a comprehensive survey has been conducted among the youth under csds's Lokniti program
 usamen yah dekhne kaa bhi prayaas hua he ki yuvaaon main sarkari naukari ke prati aakarshan kyon he
 The result of this survey is that the attraction for private jobs has decreased among the youth and has increased significantly towards government jobs
 unhen pataa he ki vidhayak or saansad banane par do do jagah se pension milti he, sarkari naukari main pension nahin he phir bhi naukari kaa jo sthayitv he vah privet naukari main nahin he
 Secondly, they have now come to know that in government jobs very rarely, everyone gets equal pay
 privet sector main mehnat or khatai zyaada he, kamai kam he
 These youngsters are well aware that Rs 50 to Rs 1000 are going to fill the form
 pariksha hoti he magar riselt nahin aata he
 65 percent of youth want government jobs
 sirf 7 pratishat privet main naukari karnaa chaahate hai
 There are 19 percent who want to do their business
 ye siesds kaa survey kahata he jo yuvaaon ko lekar kiya gaya he, jise aage chalakar kitaab kii shakl main chapa jane vaala he
 Government job seekers were 62 percent in 2007, rising to 65 percent in 2016
 2007 main bade shaharon ke 48 pratishat yuva sarkari naukari chaahate the, 2016 main inaki sankhya 62 fisadi ho gai
 In 2007, 24 per cent of the youths seeking private jobs were young, in 2016 their number was 10 per cent
 bade shaharon main bhi giravat he
 There were 17 per cent in 2007, down to 10 per cent in 2016
 sarkari naukari kii chaah rakhane main kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Why should not want a government job
 sarkaar ke paas 24 lakh pad khaali hai
 Why doesn't she say don't do a government job
 bura kya he sarkari naukari kii chahat main
 Sushil Mahapatra has spoken to the youth preparing for the government job
 naukari kii sharten mushkil hoti ja rahi hai
 Not only India, the issue of job stability is the issue of every country
 ab dekhie kis tarah se naujavaanon kii zindagi daanv par lagi he
 Do you know that 68500 teachers in Bihar have been waiting for the appointment since 2012 by passing the exam
 inamen se 2012 main kareeb 17000 kii merit list bani thi, us list main se bhi sabhi kii niyukti nahin hui he
 Merit list of 53, 500 teachers has not been made
 agar inhen 2019 tak naukari nahin mili to inhone jo pariksha paas kii he wo radd ho jaaegi
 After waiting for seven years, their lives will be ruined
 kya aapako kisi mantri ne apane twitor par bataaya he, aap dekhie, mantri log aisi jaankaree kam twit karte hai, aadha time line to jayanti or punyatithi kaa hota he jisase ve har din prerana lete hue nazar aate hai
 After passing the Bihar State Teacher Eligibility Test in 2012, his rank should have been prepared on the basis of BA b
ed
 and Tate's number and should have been restored to any high school where there is a place
 magar 17000 kii merit list bani or baaki kii nahin
 53,500 teachers are breathless that if the restoration process does not start early, their results will be recognized and they will lose their eligibility to become a teacher for a lifetime
 kai baar inhone andolan kiya
 Meet this minister, meet that minister, a question arose in the assembly but after the assurance and speech everything became normal
 in shikshakon ke anusaar bihar ke skulon main 19000 shikshakon ke pad khaali hai
 There are 5700 schools in Bihar running without teachers
 phir inhen naukari kyon nahin di ja rahi he
 Does anyone not care that the eligibility for the job of these teachers will end next year after passing the state examination itself? More than 8 lakh candidates had filled the forms for this examination and all had submitted one hundred and fifty rupees
 is paise kaa kya hua
 68500 were passed
 30 agast 2016 ke akhbaar main susheel modi kaa bayaan chapa he
 He is currently the Deputy Chief Minister but was in opposition then
 tab unhone kaha tha ki sarkaar shikshakon ko niyukti nahin dena chaahati he, bahaane bana rahi he
 We have his clipping
 aapako bataa den ki desh bhar ke skulon main shikshakon ke das lakh pad khaali hai magar har rajya main teacher eligibility test paas hokar andolan kar rahe hai
 The comments uttar pradesh main bhi tet kii pariksha paas karne vaale noujvaan naukari kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 Tired to make agitation picket assurance speech but their restoration is not happening
 ham unka haal bhi vistaar se prime time main bataaenge
 Another letter has come out stating that in August 2014, Bihar Staff Selection Commission had advertised the appointment of 13,000 clerks
 aaj chaar saal ho gaye magar us pariksha kaa koi ata-pataa nahin he
 The exam was held once in February 2017 but was canceled
 agar ab bhi chayan prakriya shuru hogi to bhi 2 saal lag jaaenge
 250 rupees were taken to fill the form of this examination
 america main sarkari naukari kii prakriya 90 dinon main ho jaati he or aapane dekha ki agast 2014 main 13000 clerk kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha magar chaar saal baad tak ek bhi pariksha nahin hui
 Why do governments not say that they will not give jobs now
 berojgaar apni kahani media main dekhnaa chaahate hai to unhen media ke theme and theory vaale taapic se bhi ladanaa hoga
 In which knowledgeable people wear big things wearing coats and in which debates the question of job seems a minor question
 aap bataaiye aapako naukari chahie ki teen murti main kis-kis kii murti lagegi iskaa hisaab chahie
 Today's story i begin with an anecdote
 mujhe to yakeen hi nahin ho rahaa he ki yah sahi bhi hoga lekin aap pehle suniye
 Shankar lives in East Delhi
 usee ke ghar or mohalle kii tasviren hai taaki aapako wo hindustan bhi dikh jaae jahaan se shankar jaise noujvaan sarkari naukariyon kii taiyaari main zindagi beetaa dete hai
 Shankar filled the form for Ordnance Factory Kanpur in 2013
 100 lebar kii bahaali honi thi, jisaki kul selary 20,000 ke aas paas hoti he
 Written test on 1 June 2014, the result of which came on 6 June 2014
 16 or 17 june 2014 ko shaareerik or chikitsa jaanch ho gai
 Police investigation forms were given to be filled
 uske baad ek patr aata he ki kuch abhyarthiyon kii pahchaan main kuch gadabadi he jisaki forensik jaanch hogi
 These people reached for forensic investigation but from December 2014 to August 2018
 inhen jwining ke liye nahin bulaayaa gaya
 Shankar claims that no one was called
 chaar saal pariksha main paas hokar intazaar hi karata rah gaya
 Shankar has sent the recording with the help of his partner
 ab aapse ek sawaal he
 Was what happened to youngsters like Shankar right? is pariksha kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha march 2013 main
 By 2014, these people had passed the examination, completed the entire process of investigation, etc
, and then there was no rumor for four years
 uske baad raksha mantralay ke tahat ardinance factory kaa aadesh aata he ki march 2013 main jo vigyaapan niklaa tha, jiske tahat 100 lebar kii niyukti kii prakriya shuru kii gai thi wo sire se radd kar di jaati he
 It is signed by the Additional General Manager
 chaar saal baad janaab inaki niyukti kii prakriya hi radd ho gai
 For this exam, these youngsters had filled the form of Rs 50
 wo bhi pani main gaya
 There is no trace of the exam for four years, one day it is said that the process which was started is canceled
 ek pankti kaa kaaran bataaya jaataa he
 This is not an issue for prime time television
 is vakt tivi par theme or theory vaala mudda chaaya rahata he jaise 2019 main modi ke saamne koun he
 Which idol should have a statue in the three idols
 in sab muddon par bahes khub hoti he
 Topics with themes and theory come with great knowledge and knowledge
 idhar noujvaan meri jaan ke peeche pade rahete hai ki aap kyon nahi dikhaate hai ki hamaare saath kya ho rahaa he
 Why is there no debate on the issue which stands before the youth of today
 nahin he
 Shankar said one more thing in his statement
 2016 main usne ardinance factory ke liye phir form bharaa
 Exams were to be held in three batches
 ek batch kii pariksha hui magar phir vahi aadesh aayaa ki baaki ke do batch kii pariksha radd kii jaati he
 From 2013 to 2018, Shankar is unemployed
 hamane naukari series ke dauraan kai baar dekha he ki pariksha hoti he or ant main kisi na kisi kaaran radd kii jaati he or phir dobaaraa kab hogi pataa nahin chalata, kai baar dobaaraa bhi nahin hoti he
 Millions of youth of India are engaged in government job examination
 koi railway kii taiyaari kar rahaa he to koi banking kii to koi esayssi kii
 Because there are a number of recruitment of these jobs
 chaatro ko pataa hota he ki kitni seat ai he
 He never gets to know when and where he has got so many seats in the private sector
 mandi or notebandi ke baad se jinaki naukari gai he unamem se bahut kam ko dobaaraa kaam mila he
 Many statistics of this is not a job, it keeps on coming from time to time
 haal hi main karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi sanghathan ne apane aankadon kii samiksha main paaya ki pichley das maheene main 46 lakh logon kii naukari ja chuki he yaa unhen dobaaraa kaam nahin mila
 It is not that there is no job
 privet sector kii naukariyon kii sankhya kaa bhale pataa na chale lekin sarkari naukariyon kaa motaa-moti hisaab he
 According to the recent statements made in Parliament, the government has 24 lakh jobs
 america patrkaar steven bril ne ek kitaab likhi he telespin
 In this book, he has written that the process of recruitment in government jobs in America is very long and complex
 kya aap jaanate hai ki vahaan kitna samay lagata he jise lekar steven bril naaraaz hai
 90 days only
 bharat main sarkari naukariyon kii bahaali main chaar chaar saal lagate hai
 We are also mentioning this because Sanjay Kumar and Pranab Gupta have written an article in the Mint newspaper
 siesds ke lokaneeti kaarykram ke tahat yuvaaon ke bich vyapak survey kiya gaya he
 It has also tried to see why the youth have a fascination for government jobs
 is survey kaa nateeja yah he ki yuvaaon main privet naukari ke prati aakarshan kam hua or sarkari naukari ke prati kaaphi badha he
 They know that on becoming an MLA and MP, they get pension from two places, there is no pension in government job, yet the stability of the job is not in private job
 doosraa ab unhen pataa chal gaya he ki sarkari naukari main kuch kam hi sahi, sabko ek baraabar selary milti he
 In the private sector, hard work and sourness is more, earnings are less
 in naujavaanon ko acchhee tarah pataa he ki 50 rupee se 1000 rupee form bharne ke liye ja rahe hai
 The test takes place but the result does not come
 65 pratishat yuva sarkari naukari chahta he
 Only 7 percent want to work in private
 19 pratishat aise hai jo apana bijness karnaa chaahate hai
 It says the survey of CSDS which has been done about the youth, which is going to be printed in the form of the book later
 2007 main sarkari naukari chaahane vaale 62 pratishat the, 2016 main badhkar 65 pratishat ho gaye
 In 2007, 48 percent of the youth of big cities wanted government jobs, in 2016 their number increased to 62 percent
 2007 main privet naukari kii chaah rakhane vaale 24 fisadi yuva the, 2016 main inaki sankhya 10 pratishat rah gai
 Big cities are also in decline
 2007 main 17 fisadi the, 2016 main 10 fisadi par aa gaye
 There is nothing wrong in wanting a government job
 kyon nahin sarkari naukari kii chaah rakhni chahie
 The government has 24 lakh vacancies
 wo kyon nahin kah detii he ki sarkari naukari mat kiijie
 What is worse than wanting a government job
 susheel mahapatra ne sarkari naukari kii taiyaari karne vaale naujavaanon se baat kii he
 Job conditions are becoming difficult
 sirf bharat hi nahin, naukari ke sthayitv kaa mudda har desh kaa mudda he
 Now see how the life of the youth is at stake
 kya aap jaanate hai ki bihar main 68500 shikshak 2012 se pariksha paas kar niyukti kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 Of these, a merit list of about 17000 was made in 2012, not all of them have been appointed in that list
 53, 500 shikshakon kii merit list nahin bani he
 If they do not get a job by 2019, then the exam they have passed will be canceled
 saat saal tak intazaar karne ke baad inaki zindagi barbaad ho jaaegi
 Have any ministers told you on their twitter, you see, minister people tweet such information less, half the time line is of jubilee and death anniversary so that they are seen taking inspiration every day
 2012 main bihar state teacher eligibility test kii pariksha paas karne ke baad bie bied or tet ke number ke aadhaar par inkaa rank taiyaar hona chahie tha or jis bhi hai skool main jahaan jagah he vahaan bahaali ho jaani chahie thi
 But the merit list of 17000 was made and the rest was not
 53,500 shikshakon kii saans ataki hui he ki agar bahaali kii prakriya jaldi shuru nahin hui to unke riselt kii manyata samaapt ho jaaegi or ve teacher banane kii paatrata jivan bhar ke liye kho denge
 He agitated many times
 is mantri se mili, us mantri se mili, vidhansabha main prashn uthaa magar aashwaasan or bhaashan ke baad sab kuch saamaanya ho gaya
 According to these teachers, the posts of 19000 teachers in Bihar schools are vacant
 bihar main 5700 skool bina shikshakon ke chal rahe hai
 Then why are they not being given jobs
 kya kisi ko parvaah nahin he ki rajya kii hi pariksha paas karne ke baad in shikshakon kii naukari kii paatrata agle saal samaapt ho jaaegi? 8 lakh se adhik abhyarthiyon ne is pariksha ke liye form bhare the or sabane dedh sau rupee jamaa kiye the
 What happened to this money? 68500 paas hue the
 Sushil Modi's statement has been published in the newspaper of 30 August 2016
 wo abhi up mukhyamantri hai magar tab vipaksh main the
 He had then said that the government does not want to appoint teachers, making excuses
 uski cliping hamaare paas he
 Let us tell you that one million posts of teachers are vacant in schools across the country, but in every state, teachers are agitating by passing the eligibility test
 tippaniyan In Uttar Pradesh too, youngsters who have passed the TET exam are waiting for jobs
 andolan dharna aashwaasan bhaashan karke thak gaye magar unki bahaali nahin ho rahi he
 We will also detail them in prime time
 ek or patr aayaa he jisamen kaha gaya he ki bihar karmchaaree chayan ayog ne agast 2014 main 13,000 clerk kii niyukti kaa vigyaapan nikaala tha
 Today it has been four years but there is no trace of that test
 ek baar farvari 2017 main pariksha hui magar radd ho gai
 Even if the selection process starts now, it will still take 2 years
 is pariksha ke form ko bharne ke liye 250 rupee liye gaye the
 In America, the process of government job is done in 90 days and you saw that in August 2014, 13000 clerk advertisements were released, but after four years, there was not a single examination
 sarkarein kyon nahin kah detii hai ki ve ab naukari nahin dengi
 If the unemployed want to see their story in the media, then they have to fight against the topic of the media and the topic
 jisamen jaankaar kot pahanakar badi-badi baaten karte hai or jin bahason main naukari kaa sawaal maamuli sawaal lagata he
 You tell me that you want a job and whose idol will be included in the three idols
 shankar ne apane saathi kii madad se recording bheji he
 Now you have a question
 kya shankar jaise naujavaanon ke saath jo hua wo sahi tha
 The advertisement for this exam was released in March 2013
 2014 tak in logon ne pariksha paas kar, jaanch vagairah kii sari prakriya puri kar lee phir uske chaar saal tak kuch sugabugahat nahin
 After that comes the order of the Ordnance Factory under the Ministry of Defense that the advertisement which was started in March 2013, under which the process of appointment of 100 Labor was started is canceled altogether
 is par adishnal general menager ke dastakhat hai
 After four years, the process of appointing him was canceled
 is pariksha ke liye in naujavaanon ne 50 rupee form ke bhare the
 He also went to the water
 chaar saal tak pariksha kaa ata pataa nahin ek din kaha jaataa he ki jo bhi prakriya shuru hui thi wo radd kii jaati he
 The reason for one line is stated
 prime time television ke liye yah sab mudda nahin he
 At this moment, the issue of theme and theory remains on TV like who is in front of Modi in 2019
 teen murti main kis kis kii murti honi chahie
 There is a lot of debate on all these issues
 theme or theory vaale taapic par bade bade jaankaar aate hai, gyaan baghaarte hai
 Here the youth are behind my life, why don't you show what is happening to us
 jo mudda aaj ke naujavaanon ke saamne khadaa he, us par koi bahes kyon nahin he
 Is not
 shankar ne apane bayaan main ek or baat kahi
 In 2016, he again filled the form for the Ordnance Factory
 teen batch main pariksha honi thi
 One batch examination took place but then the same order came that the remaining two batches are canceled
 2013 se 2018 aa gaya, shankar berojgaar he
 We have seen many times during the job series that the exam takes place and in the end is canceled for some reason and then it is not known when it will happen again, sometimes it does not happen again
 bharat ke lakhon noujvaan sarkari naukari kii pariksha main lage hai
 Some are preparing for Railways, some are banking and some are SSC
 kyonki in naukariyon kii bhartee kii ek sankhya hoti he
 Students know how many seats have been won

 Very few of those who have lost jobs since the recession and demonetisation have found work again

 Restoration of government jobs in India takes four years
 ham iskaa zikr isliye bhi kar rahe hai, kyonki sanjay kumaar or pranav gupta ne mint akhbaar main ek lekh likhaa he
 a comprehensive survey has been conducted among the youth under csds's Lokniti program

 privet sector main mehnat or khatai zyaada he, kamai kam he
 These youngsters are well aware that Rs 50 to Rs 1000 are going to fill the form

 65 percent of youth want government jobs

 There are 19 percent who want to do their business
 ye siesds kaa survey kahata he jo yuvaaon ko lekar kiya gaya he, jise aage chalakar kitaab kii shakl main chapa jane vaala he
 Government job seekers were 62 percent in 2007, rising to 65 percent in 2016
 2007 main bade shaharon ke 48 pratishat yuva sarkari naukari chaahate the, 2016 main inaki sankhya 62 fisadi ho gai
 In 2007, 24 per cent of the youths seeking private jobs were young, in 2016 their number was 10 per cent
 bade shaharon main bhi giravat he
 There were 17 per cent in 2007, down to 10 per cent in 2016
 sarkari naukari kii chaah rakhane main kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Why should not want a government job
 sarkaar ke paas 24 lakh pad khaali hai
 Why doesn't she say don't do a government job
 bura kya he sarkari naukari kii chahat main
 Sushil Mahapatra has spoken to the youth preparing for the government job
 naukari kii sharten mushkil hoti ja rahi hai
 Not only India, the issue of job stability is the issue of every country
 ab dekhie kis tarah se naujavaanon kii zindagi daanv par lagi he
 Do you know that 68500 teachers in Bihar have been waiting for the appointment since 2012 by passing the exam
 inamen se 2012 main kareeb 17000 kii merit list bani thi, us list main se bhi sabhi kii niyukti nahin hui he
 Merit list of 53, 500 teachers has not been made
 agar inhen 2019 tak naukari nahin mili to inhone jo pariksha paas kii he wo radd ho jaaegi
 After waiting for seven years, their lives will be ruined
 kya aapako kisi mantri ne apane twitor par bataaya he, aap dekhie, mantri log aisi jaankaree kam twit karte hai, aadha time line to jayanti or punyatithi kaa hota he jisase ve har din prerana lete hue nazar aate hai
 After passing the Bihar State Teacher Eligibility Test in 2012, his rank should have been prepared on the basis of BA b
ed
 and Tate's number and should have been restored to any high school where there is a place
 magar 17000 kii merit list bani or baaki kii nahin
 53,500 teachers are breathless that if the restoration process does not start early, their results will be recognized and they will lose their eligibility to become a teacher for a lifetime
 kai baar inhone andolan kiya
 Meet this minister, meet that minister, a question arose in the assembly but after the assurance and speech everything became normal
 in shikshakon ke anusaar bihar ke skulon main 19000 shikshakon ke pad khaali hai
 There are 5700 schools in Bihar running without teachers
 phir inhen naukari kyon nahin di ja rahi he
 Does anyone not care that the eligibility for the job of these teachers will end next year after passing the state examination itself? More than 8 lakh candidates had filled the forms for this examination and all had submitted one hundred and fifty rupees
 is paise kaa kya hua
 68500 were passed
 30 agast 2016 ke akhbaar main susheel modi kaa bayaan chapa he
 He is currently the Deputy Chief Minister but was in opposition then
 tab unhone kaha tha ki sarkaar shikshakon ko niyukti nahin dena chaahati he, bahaane bana rahi he
 We have his clipping
 aapako bataa den ki desh bhar ke skulon main shikshakon ke das lakh pad khaali hai magar har rajya main teacher eligibility test paas hokar andolan kar rahe hai
 The comments uttar pradesh main bhi tet kii pariksha paas karne vaale noujvaan naukari kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 Tired to make agitation picket assurance speech but their restoration is not happening
 ham unka haal bhi vistaar se prime time main bataaenge
 Another letter has come out stating that in August 2014, Bihar Staff Selection Commission had advertised the appointment of 13,000 clerks
 aaj chaar saal ho gaye magar us pariksha kaa koi ata-pataa nahin he
 The exam was held once in February 2017 but was canceled
 agar ab bhi chayan prakriya shuru hogi to bhi 2 saal lag jaaenge
 250 rupees were taken to fill the form of this examination
 america main sarkari naukari kii prakriya 90 dinon main ho jaati he or aapane dekha ki agast 2014 main 13000 clerk kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha magar chaar saal baad tak ek bhi pariksha nahin hui
 Why do governments not say that they will not give jobs now
 berojgaar apni kahani media main dekhnaa chaahate hai to unhen media ke theme and theory vaale taapic se bhi ladanaa hoga
 In which knowledgeable people wear big things wearing coats and in which debates the question of job seems a minor question
 aap bataaiye aapako naukari chahie ki teen murti main kis-kis kii murti lagegi iskaa hisaab chahie
 This is not an issue for prime time television
 is vakt tivi par theme or theory vaala mudda chaaya rahata he jaise 2019 main modi ke saamne koun he
 Which idol should have a statue in the three idols
 in sab muddon par bahes khub hoti he
 Topics with themes and theory come with great knowledge and knowledge
 idhar noujvaan meri jaan ke peeche pade rahete hai ki aap kyon nahi dikhaate hai ki hamaare saath kya ho rahaa he
 Why is there no debate on the issue which stands before the youth of today
 nahin he
 Shankar said one more thing in his statement
 2016 main usne ardinance factory ke liye phir form bharaa
 Exams were to be held in three batches
 ek batch kii pariksha hui magar phir vahi aadesh aayaa ki baaki ke do batch kii pariksha radd kii jaati he
 From 2013 to 2018, Shankar is unemployed
 hamane naukari series ke dauraan kai baar dekha he ki pariksha hoti he or ant main kisi na kisi kaaran radd kii jaati he or phir dobaaraa kab hogi pataa nahin chalata, kai baar dobaaraa bhi nahin hoti he
 Millions of youth of India are engaged in government job examination
 koi railway kii taiyaari kar rahaa he to koi banking kii to koi esayssi kii
 Because there are a number of recruitment of these jobs
 chaatro ko pataa hota he ki kitni seat ai he
 He never gets to know when and where he has got so many seats in the private sector
 mandi or notebandi ke baad se jinaki naukari gai he unamem se bahut kam ko dobaaraa kaam mila he
 Many statistics of this is not a job, it keeps on coming from time to time
 haal hi main karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi sanghathan ne apane aankadon kii samiksha main paaya ki pichley das maheene main 46 lakh logon kii naukari ja chuki he yaa unhen dobaaraa kaam nahin mila
 It is not that there is no job
 privet sector kii naukariyon kii sankhya kaa bhale pataa na chale lekin sarkari naukariyon kaa motaa-moti hisaab he
 According to the recent statements made in Parliament, the government has 24 lakh jobs
 america patrkaar steven bril ne ek kitaab likhi he telespin
 In this book, he has written that the process of recruitment in government jobs in America is very long and complex
 kya aap jaanate hai ki vahaan kitna samay lagata he jise lekar steven bril naaraaz hai
 90 days only
 bharat main sarkari naukariyon kii bahaali main chaar chaar saal lagate hai
 We are also mentioning this because Sanjay Kumar and Pranab Gupta have written an article in the Mint newspaper
 siesds ke lokaneeti kaarykram ke tahat yuvaaon ke bich vyapak survey kiya gaya he
 It has also tried to see why the youth have a fascination for government jobs
 is survey kaa nateeja yah he ki yuvaaon main privet naukari ke prati aakarshan kam hua or sarkari naukari ke prati kaaphi badha he
 They know that on becoming an MLA and MP, they get pension from two places, there is no pension in government job, yet the stability of the job is not in private job
 doosraa ab unhen pataa chal gaya he ki sarkari naukari main kuch kam hi sahi, sabko ek baraabar selary milti he
 In the private sector, hard work and sourness is more, earnings are less
 in naujavaanon ko acchhee tarah pataa he ki 50 rupee se 1000 rupee form bharne ke liye ja rahe hai
 The test takes place but the result does not come
 65 pratishat yuva sarkari naukari chahta he
 Only 7 percent want to work in private
 19 pratishat aise hai jo apana bijness karnaa chaahate hai
 It says the survey of CSDS which has been done about the youth, which is going to be printed in the form of the book later
 2007 main sarkari naukari chaahane vaale 62 pratishat the, 2016 main badhkar 65 pratishat ho gaye
 In 2007, 48 percent of the youth of big cities wanted government jobs, in 2016 their number increased to 62 percent
 2007 main privet naukari kii chaah rakhane vaale 24 fisadi yuva the, 2016 main inaki sankhya 10 pratishat rah gai
 Big cities are also in decline
 2007 main 17 fisadi the, 2016 main 10 fisadi par aa gaye
 There is nothing wrong in wanting a government job
 kyon nahin sarkari naukari kii chaah rakhni chahie
 The government has 24 lakh vacancies
 wo kyon nahin kah detii he ki sarkari naukari mat kiijie
 What is worse than wanting a government job
 susheel mahapatra ne sarkari naukari kii taiyaari karne vaale naujavaanon se baat kii he
 Job conditions are becoming difficult
 sirf bharat hi nahin, naukari ke sthayitv kaa mudda har desh kaa mudda he
 Now see how the life of the youth is at stake
 kya aap jaanate hai ki bihar main 68500 shikshak 2012 se pariksha paas kar niyukti kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 Of these, a merit list of about 17000 was made in 2012, not all of them have been appointed in that list
 53, 500 shikshakon kii merit list nahin bani he
 If they do not get a job by 2019, then the exam they have passed will be canceled
 saat saal tak intazaar karne ke baad inaki zindagi barbaad ho jaaegi
 Have any ministers told you on their twitter, you see, minister people tweet such information less, half the time line is of jubilee and death anniversary so that they are seen taking inspiration every day
 2012 main bihar state teacher eligibility test kii pariksha paas karne ke baad bie bied or tet ke number ke aadhaar par inkaa rank taiyaar hona chahie tha or jis bhi hai skool main jahaan jagah he vahaan bahaali ho jaani chahie thi
 But the merit list of 17000 was made and the rest was not
 53,500 shikshakon kii saans ataki hui he ki agar bahaali kii prakriya jaldi shuru nahin hui to unke riselt kii manyata samaapt ho jaaegi or ve teacher banane kii paatrata jivan bhar ke liye kho denge
 He agitated many times
 is mantri se mili, us mantri se mili, vidhansabha main prashn uthaa magar aashwaasan or bhaashan ke baad sab kuch saamaanya ho gaya
 According to these teachers, the posts of 19000 teachers in Bihar schools are vacant
 bihar main 5700 skool bina shikshakon ke chal rahe hai
 Then why are they not being given jobs
 kya kisi ko parvaah nahin he ki rajya kii hi pariksha paas karne ke baad in shikshakon kii naukari kii paatrata agle saal samaapt ho jaaegi? 8 lakh se adhik abhyarthiyon ne is pariksha ke liye form bhare the or sabane dedh sau rupee jamaa kiye the
 What happened to this money? 68500 paas hue the
 Sushil Modi's statement has been published in the newspaper of 30 August 2016
 wo abhi up mukhyamantri hai magar tab vipaksh main the
 He had then said that the government does not want to appoint teachers, making excuses
 uski cliping hamaare paas he
 Let us tell you that one million posts of teachers are vacant in schools across the country, but in every state, teachers are agitating by passing the eligibility test
 tippaniyan In Uttar Pradesh too, youngsters who have passed the TET exam are waiting for jobs
 andolan dharna aashwaasan bhaashan karke thak gaye magar unki bahaali nahin ho rahi he
 We will also detail them in prime time
 ek or patr aayaa he jisamen kaha gaya he ki bihar karmchaaree chayan ayog ne agast 2014 main 13,000 clerk kii niyukti kaa vigyaapan nikaala tha
 Today it has been four years but there is no trace of that test
 ek baar farvari 2017 main pariksha hui magar radd ho gai
 Even if the selection process starts now, it will still take 2 years
 is pariksha ke form ko bharne ke liye 250 rupee liye gaye the
 In America, the process of government job is done in 90 days and you saw that in August 2014, 13000 clerk advertisements were released, but after four years, there was not a single examination
 sarkarein kyon nahin kah detii hai ki ve ab naukari nahin dengi
 If the unemployed want to see their story in the media, then they have to fight against the topic of the media and the topic
 jisamen jaankaar kot pahanakar badi-badi baaten karte hai or jin bahason main naukari kaa sawaal maamuli sawaal lagata he
 You tell me that you want a job and whose idol will be included in the three idols
 bharat ke lakhon noujvaan sarkari naukari kii pariksha main lage hai
 Some are preparing for Railways, some are banking and some are SSC
 kyonki in naukariyon kii bhartee kii ek sankhya hoti he
 Students know how many seats have been won
 use yah kabhi pataa nahin chalata he ki privet sector main kab or kahaan kitni seat ai he
 Very few of those who have lost jobs since the recession and demonetisation have found work again
 naukari nahin he iske kai aankade samay samay par aate rahete hai
 Recently, the Employees Provident Fund Organization, in a review of its data, found that 46 lakh people had lost their jobs in the last ten months or they could not find work again
 aisa nahin he ki naukari nahi he
 The number of private sector jobs may not be known, but government jobs account for a lot
 haal hi main sansad main die gaye bayanon ke hisaab se sarkaar ke paas 24 lakh naukariyaan hai
 American journalist Steven Brill has written a book called Telespin
 is kitaab main unhone likhaa he ki america main sarkari naukariyon main bhartee kii prakriya bahut lambii or jatil he
 Do you know how long it takes to get there, Steven Brill is angry
 maatr 90 din
 Restoration of government jobs in India takes four years
 ham iskaa zikr isliye bhi kar rahe hai, kyonki sanjay kumaar or pranav gupta ne mint akhbaar main ek lekh likhaa he
 a comprehensive survey has been conducted among the youth under csds's Lokniti program
 usamen yah dekhne kaa bhi prayaas hua he ki yuvaaon main sarkari naukari ke prati aakarshan kyon he
 The result of this survey is that the attraction for private jobs has decreased among the youth and has increased significantly towards government jobs
 unhen pataa he ki vidhayak or saansad banane par do do jagah se pension milti he, sarkari naukari main pension nahin he phir bhi naukari kaa jo sthayitv he vah privet naukari main nahin he
 Secondly, they have now come to know that in government jobs very rarely, everyone gets equal pay
 privet sector main mehnat or khatai zyaada he, kamai kam he
 These youngsters are well aware that Rs 50 to Rs 1000 are going to fill the form
 pariksha hoti he magar riselt nahin aata he
 65 percent of youth want government jobs
 sirf 7 pratishat privet main naukari karnaa chaahate hai
 There are 19 percent who want to do their business
 ye siesds kaa survey kahata he jo yuvaaon ko lekar kiya gaya he, jise aage chalakar kitaab kii shakl main chapa jane vaala he

 Reacting to this, the Chief Minister of Gujarat said in his own style, “people give examples of dog loyalty
 agar meri vafadari desh ke kaam aae to acha he
 He dismissed the allegations of doing politics of breaking the country and said that the country suffers from those who do politics of caste and appeasement

 How different is the life of the poor and unemployed in Left ruled Tripura or Bengal, the poor of BJP ruled Jharkhand or Chhattisgarh? Are the hospitals in Haryana better than the hospitals in Karnataka? The corruption of Madhya Pradesh, how much more than Punjab Is it different? How is the leader-company nexus of Gujarat different from that of West Bengal or Tamil Nadu? What is the significance of economic equality in Left ruled states? Was used? Which spring of investment and jobs has come down in the BJP ruled states? What ideal administration did the all-inclusive Congress give? This is the right time to raise these questions
 kyonki bharat ke logon ne laal, bhagava, hare, nile, safed sabhi rangon kii sarkarein dekh lee hai
 It is necessary to ask ourselves, what difference does a political thought have on our lives through electoral success or failure? In practice, the difference in people's lives only comes from what kind of government came out of the election
 dhahaate rahiye lenin kii murti, khadey karte rahiye shiva ji or sardaar patel ke putale yaa sajaate rahiye ambedkar park
 In a constitutional democracy, if no political thought can give a good government, then its status is no more than that of a tribal organization, which is focused on destroying the idols of the adversary or making his own, not on making or bettering the lives of the people
 alag-alag vichaaron kii sarkarein logon ko unka haq dene ke maamle main ek jaisi hi kyon pai jaati hai?isaki do vajahen hai:pehali—sarkaar main aane or adarsh sarkaar hone main rai-pahaad jaisaa fark he
 Generally, political ideologies have no new idea of government or governance
 udhaaharan ke liye pichley chaar varshon main har saal kisi na kisi rajya main barahavin ke parche se lekar medical or judishiri kii parikshaon ke parche li hue hai
 Staff Selection Commission examination paper leak is in this order
 har saal lakhon yuvaaon kii mehnat mitti ho jaati he lekin kisi bhi vichaardhaara kii sarkaar ke paas parikshaon ko niraapad banane kii koi nai sujh nahin he
 Decades later, despite the rule of a single party (coalition) on 22 states of the country and about 60 per cent of GDP, the old wooden vessels from banks to farming and from hospital to court are going up with new colors
 kahin koi gunatmak badlaav nahin dikhataa
 Second, governments suffer greatly from the political neutrality of the constitution
 samvidhan ne sarkaron ko kism-kism ke sansthagat pareekshanon se gujaarne kii lambii vyavastha banaai
 Governments weaken these institutions or try to impose political views on these apolitical institutions so that they can remain in power by fearing the second idea
 achraj nahin ki ek dal kii dabangai vaali sarkaron kii tulana main mili-jule rajnatik vichaaron kii sarkarein, kamobesh zyada utpaadak raheen hai
 She was probably not in a position to mislead one
 raajnneeti ab jan paksh kaa sthaayee vipaksh ho chali he
 Politicians fight a battle with the people inside
 unka sabase bada dar yah he ki log kahin vah na samaj jaaen jo unhen samajhnaa chahie
 This war of leaders is against understanding, logic and question
 prashn swaabhaavik rup se unki sarkaar se puche jaaenge jo thos or moort he
 Who is going to ask the abstract ideology why there are scams in the bank? People want good government, ideas are for thinkers and campaigners
 prashn saahas kii sristi karte hai or bhram se janm letaa he bhay
 The peak of confusion is the golden age of politics
 log rassi ko saanp samaj len or vichaar ko sarkaar, siyasat ko or kya chahie?dhyaan rahe ki lenin kii jo murti dhahaai gai, vah janata kii jameen par janata ke paise se bani thi or patel kii jo murti banaai ja rahi he, usamen bhi karadaataaon kaa paisa laga he
 In elections we choose the government, not the idea
 yadi ham chaahate hai ki hamen vidhvansak yaa napunsak vichaaron ke badale thos or javabdeh sarkarein milen to kya har paanch saal main prayek sarkaar ke saath vahi karnaa hoga jo tripura ke logon ne maanik sarkaar ke saath 25 saal baad kiya?yani ki chalo palatai!*** After the case was filed by the Patna AIIMS management, Kanhaiya Kumar, former president of the JNU Students' Union, said that the case has been registered not at the behest of the central leadership of the BJP, but by the doctor or the AIIMS management
 lekin kanhaiya ne kaha ki agar sarkaar or aspataal prabandhan chaahe to maamle kii jaanch sibiai yaa nyaayik jaanch kara sakati he
 Because there are BJP governments in the state and the center
 tippaniyan Kanhaiya, while talking to NDTV news, said that after sparking a debate on BJP leaders regarding admission in the hospital ward, they had to say that there were five security personnel with me to inquire with them and milk of milk will become water water

 As soon as Arjun's car reached there, we did not take any pictures because it could have done that Arjun would have returned soon
