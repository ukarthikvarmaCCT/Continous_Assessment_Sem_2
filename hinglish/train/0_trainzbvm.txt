 It is said that where there is more love, sourness also arises there

 The mood of the house members had ceased since Kamya left
 sabko chehakaane ke liye big bos ek dance number bajaate hai

 gauhar kushal se kahati he ki ve unke saath dance floor par aa jaaen or dance karen
 But they do not pay attention to this request of Gauhar, she calls Ejaz

 Sangram advises Aijaz to keep distance from both of them
 kushal or gauhar ke bich takaraar kaayam rahati he
 They do not even talk the next day and appear to be avoiding the conversation
 bhartiya rigerv bainkya to 2000 rupee ke noton ko chalan main nahin bhej rahaa he yaa phir usne in noton kii chapai band kar di he
 SBI has expressed apprehension in its research report that RBI is reducing the supply of big notes in circulation
 esbiai ne buudhvaar ko apniicoflash reportmen kaha ki 8 disambar 2017 tak 15,78,700 karod rupee mulya ke oonche moolyavarg vaale noton kii chapai kii he
 According to the report, out of these, notes worth Rs 2,46,300 crore have not been supplied in the market
 esbiai ne report main ashanka jataai he ki yaa to kendriya bank oonche moolyavarg vaale noton kii chapai band kar saktaa he yaa phir vah printed note kii aapurti chalan main band kar saktaa he
 SBI has stated in its research report on the basis of figures presented by the government in Lok Sabha and annual report of RBI that the value of small currency was Rs 3,50,100 crore as of March 2017
 esbiai ne kaha he ki agar 8 disambar tak choti moolyavarg vaale noton kii vailu alag kar di jaae, to aise main is taarikh tak bade moolyavarg vaale noton kii vailu 13,32,400 karod thi
 The report states that RBI has till December 8, 1695 of 500 rupees
 7 karod note chaape hai
 At the same time, he had 365 till this date

 The report has given this information based on the data presented by the Finance Ministry in the Lok Sabha
 report main kaha gaya he ki isaki kul vailu 15,78,700 karod rupee rahi he
 Saumya Kanti Ghosh, the author of the report and Group Chief Economic Advisor of SBI, said that from these figures it appears that the central bank has printed big notes worth Rs 2643 billion (rs 15,787 billion - Rs 13,324 billion), but They have not been sent to circulation
 report main kaha gaya he ki philhal yah maananaa surakshit he ki is dauraan arabiai ne 2,643 arab rupye ke chote mulya ke note, jisamen 50 or 200 rupee ke note shaamil hai, chhap liye hon
 The report said that as a logical result it can be said that the transaction of 2000 rupee notes is facing a lot of challenges
 aise main ho saktaa he kiarbiai ne liquidityki sthiti banaae rakhane ke liye shuruyaat main bade noton kii kaaphi maatra main chapai kii
 But after some time it may be that he has either stopped printing of big notes or he has speeded up the printing of small notes
 report main anumaan jataayaa gaya he ki in aankadon se aisa lagata he ki cirkulation main chote noton kii hissedari 35 fisadi tak pahunch gai hogi
 Last year, on 8 November, the Modi government announced the withdrawal of 500 and 1000 rupee notes
 us vakt chalan main kul mudra main in donon noton kii hissedari 86-87 fisadi thi

 bhaajapa ke netritv main endie kii sarkaar ne jab 2014 main kaamkaaj sambhala tha to saaf taur par raksha mantralay uske khaas jor vaale halkon main se tha
 The party's manifesto made at least 15 promises to restore the functioning of this ministry
 inamen hathiyaaron kii kharid ko tej karne se lekar raksha kshetra main pratyaksh videshi nivesh ko badhaava dene or swadeshi raksha praudyogikiyaan viksit karnaa, raksha nirmaan main teji laana or raksha pension main vruddhi karne kii lambey samay se chali aa rahi maang ko puraa karnaa or aazaadee ke baad kii ladaaiyon main shahid hue bhartiya sainikon ke liye ek yuddh smarak bananaa, sab shaamil tha
 Four years later, the achievements of the Ministry of Defense have been mixed
 kai saare vaade to usne puure kiye hai, jaise ki van rank van pension or yuddh smarak banane kaa kaam bhi shuru ho gaya he
 But in other cases, the pace of achieving results is slow, such as promoting indigenous defense manufacturing or attracting foreign investment in the defense sector
 iske peeche kii kuch vajahon main ek to yah he ki un dhaanchon ko durust kiye bina nitiyon kaa elaan kar diya gaya jo un par amal karne vaale the
 Secondly, there was no continuity in leadership
 sheersh par baar-baar badlaav hote rahe or mantralay ne chaar saal main teen mantri dekh liye
 This lost the focus that this particular ministry needed
 lekin raksha mantralay main sudhaar lagu na hone kaa matlab yah he ki sainya kalpurjon main aatm-nirbharta (mek in india) jaise kai prashansaneey lakshya pichad jaaenge kyonki tab unki haalat ghode ke aage ghodagadee lagane jaisi ho jaaegi
 Nirmala Sitharaman took over as India's first full-time woman defense minister eight months ago
 us samay aisa lag rahaa tha maano vah kisi romaanchak van-de match ke aakhri overon main khilne ke liye utraa koi puchalla ballebaaj hon
 But so far she has proved to be a strong player
 unhone mantralay main khaasi urja pravaahit kii he
 She has been traveling around the country to participate in military exercises
 unhone kai nitigat badlaav bhi kiye hai jinamein chizon ko tarksangat banane kaa nayaa mantra bhi shaamil he, jiske myne hai raksha mantralay ke har paise ke badale puri vasuuli hona
 He has formulated a new defense construction policy and established the Defense Industrial Corridor
 enese ajit dobhaal ke adheen ek nai raksha yojana samiti gathit kii gai he taaki vah rodmap ke abhaav kii khami ko durust kar sake or rashtriya suraksha or raksha yojana dastavejon kaa khaakaa taiyaar kar sake
 Women Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in battle, 58 years in defense sector's make in India initiative and defense sector in just 1 year in four years

 The FDI figure is a matter of grave concern
 lekin mantralay ke kaamkaaj kii style main kai mahatvapurn or saraahneey badlaav hue hai
 Under Sitharaman and his predecessor Manohar Parrikar, the Ministry of Defense has become more open and accountable than at any time in the past
 jo chote or manzole upkram pehle kabhi varisht afasaron se mulaakaat kii ummid bhi nahin laga sakate the, unke liye ab south block main daravaaje khule rahete hai
 Large-scale corruption in defense procurement has also been eliminated
 sainya kalpurjon kaa aasaan aayaat ab koi maanak nahin rah gaya he
 Such imports proved costly to us in the long run as they did not contribute to indigenous defense manufacturing
 pichley kuch maheenon ke nitigat badlaavon ne gharelu udyog ko utsahit kiya he
 It can be said that the light is now visible at the other mouth of the dark tunnel

 After the billions of rupees bank loan scam involving Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi, now the Delhi Citizen Cooperative Bank scam has come to light
 yahaan farji dastavej par jamkar lone baante gaye
 The loan was monitored by making fake e-stamp, fake ITR, fake registry, fake address documents and what not
 haalat ye ki karmchaariyon or dallalon kii mileebhagat se bank ko karodon rupee kaa chuunaa lagaataa rahaa or bank ankhen moond chupchaap baitha rahaa
 Yamuna Vihar Branch, Karavalanagar Branch, Shahdara Branch, Lajpat Nagar Branch, Janakpuri Branch and Naane Kisni and the branch were rigged between 2011 and 2014 in the name of loans
 farji sadsy banaaehzaron kii taadaad main farji tareeke se sochi samajhi saazish ke tahatbank sadsybanaae gaye jiske baad lakhon-karodon rupee ke lone ko hadap kiya gaya
 Information about embezzlement, scams, fake loans, from the bank, chairman, directors and officials to the Registrar of Societies were allegedly known to all, but everyone kept silence
 itane saal biit jaanane ke baad bhi bank ne kanoonee karrwai ke naam par khanaapurti tak bhi nahin kii
 This investigation of the accounts of Delhi Citizen Co-operative Bank in the capital of the country was exposed by the special investigation team of "aaj Tak" in its investigation
 sabase pehle jaanch ke tahat moujpur main paaya ki mona naam kii mahila ne 2014 main saadhe chaar lakh rupee lone liye the
 Yamuna Vihar branch of Delhi Citizen Co-operative Bank lent Mona on loan to increase the work of butic
 lekin jahaan boutique kaa pataa tha vahaan par khaali plot mila
 Mona, while taking the loan, put all the documents including the three-year income tax return, PAN card in the bank
 wo saare kagaz farji the or mona gharon main kaam karke guzaara chalaati thi
 The loan money that came to Mona's account went to the account of a person named Umesh
 moujpur ilaake main hi rahane vaale sarkari karmchaaree vishaal pathak ne teen lakh kaa lone liya
 But this loan has become a mess for him
 vishaal pathak kii maane to unhone bank main lone lene ke liye kaagaj lagaae, lekin aaj tak unke acount main lone kaa paisa aayaa hi nahin
 In lieu of this, then the notice to repay the installment for the loan recovery
 hairaani kii baat he ki vishaal pathak kaa paisa bhi umesh naam ke shaks ke khate main hi gaya
 It is also shocking that in the name of Vishal Pathak, the bank has also taken the security of repaying loans of people whom they do not even know
 aaj tak kii special invastigeshan team jaanch ke tahat hi yamuna vihaar main makaan number C-12 / 8 tak pahunchi
 The Maggot couple living here were given about Rs 10 lakh from the bank in 2012-13 as a loan for renovation of the house and running the boutique
 hairaani kii baat he yahaan naa rinovations hua, naa hi koi koi boutique khulaa
 When the Aaj Tak team investigated the documents for the loan, it was found that the loan was taken by giving all fake documents
 yahaan bhi lone kii guarantee vishaal pathak ne di hui thi jiskaa khud vishaal ko hi nahin pataa tha
 This money also went to Umesh's account
 aaj tak kii team talash ke baad umesh tak pahunch gai
 Umesh said that 5 loans were transferred to his account
 umesh ne daawa kiya ki ye sab bank ke purv diarector ke ishaare par hua
 His people used to make fake papers and got people loaned
 chaunkaane vaali baat he ki is jaalsaaji ke bare main sab kuch bank ko pataa hone ke baavjood umesh ke khilaaf ek bhi shikaayat police main darj nahin kii gai
 The connivance of the employees were common people who, in collusion with the bank employees, took loans in a fraudulent manner and the bank did not take any concrete action
 lekin yahaan to bank main baithe dector ajit singh ne bhi farji tareeke se lone liya or chupchaap se chukaa diya
 Ajit Singh applied for a loan in the bank and in the papers showed himself to be an employee of a private school in Karaval Nagar for taking a loan
 vahiin kii selleri slip lagaai
 When we went to that school to investigate, it was found that Ajit Singh has a school of his own and he has never been an employee of this school
 itnaa hi nahin ajit singh ne jo i-stamp kii registrary lagaai wo bhi farji thi
 Like the director Ajit Singh, the bank chairman's relatives were not behind in the fraud
 bank main aisi registry rakhwai gai jis par naa to kharidne vaale ke hastakshar the naa bechney vaale ke
 When the chairman was made to talk about this, at first he avoided speaking anything
 phir kaha ki aisa kuch unki jaankaree main nahin he
 There were 5 cases in this entire case and all of them are associated with Lajpat Nagar branch of the bank and lodged in Amar Colony police station
 inamen abhi tak police kii taraf se koi tafteesh nahin hui he
 When the matter started taking political color, the Lt
 Governor handed over the investigation to the EOW of Delhi Police
 arabiai niyam kii udin dhajjiyaanvarsh 2013 main hi arabiai kii report ne saaf kar diya tha ki dilli naagarik bank main sabakuch thik nahin he
 The report said that 80 percent of the loans in the Lajpat Nagar branch were given in a fake way
 ye saare lone yaa to shaadi main bhaat dene ke naam par the yaa phir makaan thik karaane ke naam par
 The RBI had raised objections as to why there was no other motive for the loan
 ye shakha us vakt ke chairman jayabhagwan ke control main thi
 In the same report, a loan of Rs 283 lakh was found to be foul
 baad main paanch peediton ne court ke madhyam se farji lone ke paanch mukademe bhi karwaae lekin usamen naa to police ne or naa hi bank ne koi karrwai kii
 How open case: RTI activist Anil Kumar Gaur had complained in 2016 about fake loans from 717 accounts of several banks
 uske baad sirf 72 khaaton kii jaanch hui or jinamein 58 khaaton main farji kagajaat ke jariye lone lene kii baat samaane ai thi
 After this, the Registrar of Societies Office conducted an investigation under section 62 under the leadership of an officer named Sanjay Sharma
 jaanch main saamne aayaa ki bank ne bade paimaane par niyamon ko taak par rakh kar pehle to farji sadsy banaae
 Then fake documents were made for giving loan like income tax return, address proof etc
 phir sab lone ko aankh band kar bina kisi jaanch padtaal paas kar diya gaya
 All this happened with the alleged collusion of bank employees

 ' The UP government has suffered a major setback from the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court
 court ne upi sarkaar kii us aadesh ko radd kar diya jisamen alpsankhyak samudaay ke logon ke khilaaf aatanki vaardaaton se jude cese waapas liye gaye the
 The court said that the state government cannot withdraw terror cases without the consent of the central government
 hoicourt kii lakhanu bench ne kaha ki zyaadaatar aropiyon ke khilaaf kendriya adhinium ke tahat maamle darj kiye gaye hai isliye rajya sarkaar centre ko jaankaree die bina ise hataa nahin sakati
 This decision of the court just before the Lok Sabha elections is being seen as a major setback for the Akhilesh Yadav-led SP government
 aapako bataa den ki upi sarkaar ne aantki vaardaaton ke aaropee 19 logon ke khilaaf cese waapas lene kaa faisla kiya tha
 It also includes the accused in the Sankatmochan temple blast in Varanasi and the serial blast in the court premises in 2007
 is suchi main ek mahila kaa bhi naam he jis par pakistani jasoos ko panaah dene kaa aarope he

 gauratlab he ki samaajawaadee party ne vidhansabha chunaavon main vaada kiya tha ki agar party satta main aati he to un muslimon ko nyaay milegaa, jo galat tareeke se giraftaar kiye gaye hai yaa phir jinhen aatanki vaardaaton main fansaaya gaya he
 This decision of the government was being seen as appeasement of the Muslim community, which also had the sp's advantage
 gujarat main bijepi kii siten ghati hai
 But the vote share has increased by about one and a quarter per cent over 2012
 isi ke sahare bijepi congress ke us aakraamak campan kii kaat kar saki
 The campaign that Rahul Gandhi sharpened and for the first time it showed that the BJP was in a lot of trouble in Gujarat
 22 saal ke satta virdohi maahaul ko dhwast karnaa bijepi ke liye aasaan nahin tha phir bhi agar narendra modi ne gujarat main ye karke dikhaaya to ye bijepi kii badi jeet he
 The contest of thorns was such that in many seats the victory and defeat was decided by a few hundred and a few thousand votes
 kaise bijepi ne congress ke aakraamak campan se bane maahaul ke saamne nai ranneeti apanaai
 How to minimize losses in your core vote base
 kaise congress ke garh main send lagaakar nuksaan ko puraa kiya
 Its analysis is important
 siten bhale hi pichhali baar se kam ho, bijepi kaa kor vot share bana rahaa
 This is the reason why the BJP imposed a six of power in Gujarat
 bhale hi kitni naaraazgi rahi ho
 These were the big factors of bjp's election victory in Gujarat
 - shahari or kasbaai ilaakon main bijepi kaa kabza bana rahaa
 - BJP won 43 seats out of 55 seats in urban areas
 - ahmedabad, vadodara jaise garh ko bijepi ne banaae rakhaa
 Except Gujarat, Kutch and Saurashtra dominated the rest of Gujarat
 - congress ke puraane garh adivasee ilaakon main BJP ne send laga di
 - Patidars lost votes, but to a large extent, OBC voters joined
 - jiesti ke khilaaf andolan ke garh surat main bhi kaamyaab rahe
 The biggest challenge of the BJP was to break the caste equation of Gujarat, which the Congress had made about a month before the elections as part of its smart electoral strategy
 isamen patidaar netaa hardik patel, obisi netaa alpesh thakor or dalit netaa jignesh mewaani kii tikdi khaas rahi
 The Congress was successful in working out the caste equation against the BJP, because the Congress broke the vote of the Patidars
 alpesh thakor or jignesh mewaani se bhi congress ko phayda hua
 Even if there was not much benefit that he would have left the BJP behind
 lekin asal main bijepi ne congress ke garh main send lagane or shahari ilaakon main kabza banaae rakhkar gujarat kaa garh barkaraar rakhaa
 In Gujarat, the gap between BJP and Congress was less than 20
 ye gujarat ke romaanchak chunavi match ko bataata he ki ek-ek seat par aisa kadaa muqabla rahaa ki aakhri vakt tak candidet aage peeche hote rahe
 There were 17 seats in Gujarat, where the margin of victory was less than 2000 votes
 2000 vot se kam antar se bijepi ne 8 siten jeetin to 9 congress ne jeetin
 There were 8 seats in Gujarat where the margin of victory was less than 1000 votes
 1000 vot se kam antar se bijepi ne 2 or congress ne 6 siten jiti hai
 Congress won the tribal-dominated Kaprada seat by just 170 votes
 godhra kii seat ko bijepi ne sirf 258 vot se jeeta
 The Congress won the Mansa seat by just 524 votes from the BJP
 ye kaante kii takkar hi gujarat kii chunavi kahani he, jisaki jeet kaa utsaah aaj khud pradhanmantri ke chehre or bhaashan se dikh rahaa tha
 That is why he was repeatedly reminded of bjp's consecutive victory in Gujarat for three decades
 uttar pradesh ke kaddavar mantri or samaajawaadee party ke varisht netaa mohammad ajam khan ne america badasluki kaa shikaar hui bhartiya rajanyik devayani khobragade ko rampur se loksabhaa se chunaav ladgaye kaa nyotaa diya he
 Azam said that Devyani should leave this jilted job and fight elections from Rampur and strongly oppose America by reaching Parliament
 gauratlab he ki kuch maheene pehle ajam khan bhi america isi tarah kii badasluki se do chaar ho chuke hai
 He went to give lectures on the success of the Kumbh Mela in America at that time
 ajam ne america main tainaat bhartiya rajanyik devayani khobragade ke saath amareeki prashasan dwaara maryaadaaon se pare kiye gayi gande vyavhaar kii kade shabdon main ninda karte huye is baat par behad afsos zaahir kiya ki bhartiya samskruti va hindutv ke alambardaar bijepi jaise dalon ne devayani ke saath huye amareeki suluk ko kaise bardaasht kiya, kisi ne koi khaas pratikriya nahin di
 Even an organization like VHP remained silent
 unhone kaha ki in logon kii yah chuppi ek hairaani kii baat he
 Azam Khan said that America is a country which has been behaving indefinitely especially with the Indians for years, even it has not spared the most respected people of this country
 america pahunchane par khud unke saath bhi aisa hi jilltabharaa vyavhaar kiya gaya tha, jiske khilaaf unhone vahiin se fouran virodh kiya tha or is sharmnaak va apmaan bhare vyavhaar par apana sakht rosh darj karaayaa tha, jab ki bahut se bhartiya jo is durvyavhaar ke shikaar hue, unhone kai varshon baad ise ujagar kiya
 Jaya Prada is MP from Rampur at the moment
 saal 2009 main vah sapa ke tikat par chunaav jiti thim or us vakt ajam khan party main nahin the
 Later, Jaya and his political guru Amar Singh left the SP and Azam returned to the party
 pakistan kii ore se niyantran rekha par lagaataar sangharshaviram ulanghan ke kaaran seemaa surakshabal (biguef) ne aaj diwali ke maukey par pakistani ranger ko mithai nahin bhent kii

 This is the difference between BJP and us

 com / im1tdsyof2 — Congress (@incindia) January 24, 2019 Why is the Northeast important? According to the 2019 electoral battle, part of the Northeast is going to be important for both the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress
 ek taraf bijepi ne apana puraa focus un siton par kiya he jahaan vah 2014 main chunaav nahin jeet pai thi or is chunaav main agar uttar bharat main ghaataa hota he to yahaan se ricover kar sake
 At the same time, it has also become clear in many election polls that the Congress is not able to directly contest the Bharatiya Janata Party in North India
 isliye congress kaa bhi focus aise kshetron main he jahaan par vah majboot he
 Let me tell you that Congress President Rahul Gandhi was in his parliamentary constituency Amethi for the last two days, from where he fiercely attacked the Narendra Modi government of the Center
 rahul gandhi ne daawa kiya ki 2019 main congress hi centre main sarkaar banaaegi, iske alaava unhone narendra modi par rafel deal main gadabadi karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Explain that the demand of Shiv Sena was that two and a half years would be the Chief Minister of Shiv Sena and two and a half years would become the Chief Minister of BJP
 bijepi (BJP) ne shivasena (shiv Sena) kii is maang ko sire se khaarij kar diya tha ki is tarah ke kisi bhi samjhaute par sahyogi dal ke saath koi charchaa nahin kii gai
 After this, Arvind Sawant, the only Shiv Sena minister included in the Center, resigned
 haalanki shivasena ke NDA se alag hone kii aupchaarik ghoshnaa nahin kii gai thi
 Explain that in the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly, BJP has 105 seats, Shiv Sena has 56 seats, while NCP and Congress have 54 and 44 seats respectively

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday directed to supply adequate power during Deepawali
 unhone prashasan ko yah nirdesh bhi diya ki saamaajik sadbhaav bigaadane vaale asaamaajik tatwon par kadi najar rakhi jaae taaki maahaul kharaab na ho
 The Chief Minister said that on the occasion of Diwali, the law and order should be completely correct, for this it is necessary that the security system should be round-the-clock
 pataakhon kii bikri bheedbhad se dur bahari ilaakon main kiya jaae
 Akhilesh also instructed the officers to maintain equal contact with the enlightened and senior people of the society to maintain law and order
 akhilesh ne kaha ki deepawali ke avasar par bijli kii paryaapt aapurti kii jaaegi or parivahan vyavastha ko bhi durust rakhaa jayega
 Keeping in mind the damage caused by firecrackers to the environment, he appealed to the people to be careful while lighting firecrackers, as accidents often occur on this festival
 milavatakhori ke khilaaf vyapak abhiyaan chalaane kaa nirdesh dete hue unhone kaha ki is tarah ke logon se sakhti se nipta jaae, kyonki kisi ko bhi janata ke swasthya ke saath khilwaad karne kii ijaajat nahin di jaaegi
 Instructing the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Corporation to make special preparations on the occasion of Deepawali, he said that during this time, maximum power should be supplied so that people can celebrate the festival with joy
 beeti raat meerut ke ek gaanv main hue khun- kharabe main exise vibhaag ke teen inspector samet 8 sipaahi buree tarah jakhmi ho gaye
 The incident took place when the team of the Excise Department arrived to raid the illegal liquor furnaces operating in the village
 is ghatana main ek vyakti kii maut bhi ho gai
 After the incident, the district administration has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the matter
 meerut ke mirzapur gaanv main pulicekarmiyon kii ek team vahaan chal rahi avaidh sharaab kii bhatti band karaane gaye the, jise vahaan ke logon ne ghayal kar diya
 According to the excise officer, as soon as the liquor furnaces were raided, the people preparing the liquor escaped and crossed the river and informed the villagers on the mobile
 uske baad saikadon kii sankhya main logon ne exise or police team kii gaadi ko gher liya or unhen bandhak bana liya
 After being surrounded, the police finally had to fire in their defense, in which a village man was killed

 The back-and-forth game between former finance minister Yashwant Sinha and current finance minister Arun Jaitley is not over
 arun jetali ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki kuch log 80 saal kii umr main naukari ke aavedak bananaa chaahate hai
 Now Yashwant Sinha has said on this, 'if i had been a job applicant, he (arun Jaitley) might not have been number one'
 yashavanth sinha ne kaha ki arun jetali meri prishthbhumi bhul gaye hai
 i have stumbled rate-by-politics in politics
 12 saal kii IAS kii naukari baaki thi jab raajnneeti main aa gaye hai
 Advani ji said that one should never do personal attacks
 yashavanth sinha ne kaha ki main har sector par charchaa karne ko taiyaar hum, har sector main giravat ho rahi he
 Sinha said that i had chosen my Lok Sabha seat shortly after joining politics
 mujhe apni loksabhaa kii seat chunane main 25 saal nahin lage hai
 Yashwant said that those who did not see the shape of the Lok Sabha are blaming me
 maine kisi par personal atake nahin kiya he
 Yashwant Sinha said that i had rejected a ministerial position in VP Singh's government, but Arun Jaitley accepted the post of Minister of State in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government
 vah loksabhaa main pahunche bhi nahin the
 He said that Finance Minister is misleading the country on black money, Jaitley is misleading on black money and Panama
 unhone bataaya ki main or chidambaram kabhi dost nahin rahe hai, balki arun jetali or chidambaram dost rahe hai
 Why no action is being taken in Panama case in India
 ham mudde se bhatakane nahin denge, isliye personal aarope laga rahe hai
 The person who is a member of the Lok Sabha can understand the words of the people, only if there are blisters in the feet will they understand something
 jetali ne kiya tha palatvarbata den ki guuruuvaar ko ek kaarykram main arun jetali ne kaha tha ki desh main videshi nivesh lagaataar bad rahaa he or yah ab tak kaa sabase zyada he
 Let me tell you that when Gentleman was the Finance Minister, we had only four days foreign exchange reserves
 joki ab 4 billian dollar ho gaya he
 Jaitley's reply to Yashwant on 'health of economy', kept these 10 facts, reminded 2002 Chidambaram was also attacking Ghairashwant Sinha and Congress leader Chidambaram saying that people are criticizing GST and demonetisation that it is implemented in haste was done
 kabhi hamaare yahaan aisi sthitiyaan thi ki sarkaar ke faislon kii vajah se bhrashtachar hota tha, policy paralisis banati
 Now people are criticizing the decisions
 yashavanth ne kiya he sabase bada waraisase pehle, arthvyavastha kii maujuuda haalat ke liye vitt mantri arun jetali par hamalaa karke rajnatik tufaan khadaa kar chuke sinha ne kaha ki arthvyavastha kii haalat par charchaa ke liye unhone pichley saal pradhanmantri narendra modi se mulaakaat kaa samay maanga tha lekin unhen samay nahin mila
 Yashwant Sinha said, 'I found that the doors were closed for me
 isliye, mere paas media main bolne ke alaava koi vikalp nahin tha
 i am sure i have suitable suggestions to give to the Prime Minister
 sinha ne kaha ki purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh yaa purv kendriya vitt mantri pi chidambaram jaise log jinhen vittiya maamalon par visheshgy mana jaataa he agar bolen to us samay kii sarkaar ko use sunanaa chahie
 He advised against rejecting the views of those people as 'political verbiage'
 kya kisi baat ko lekar aap donon ke bich kaha-suni ho gai he? kya wo aapse naaraaz hai? kya unki naaraazgi aapako bardaasht nahin ho rahi? agar aapako unka naaraaz hona itnaa bura lag rahaa he to bina der kiye unhen manaa lijie
 Many times it happens that we inadvertently do something that makes the front person feel bad

 But Moushumi Chatterjee did not like coming to the event wearing anchor jeans

 Objecting to the wearing of jeans, he said that the anchor should have come wearing Indian clothes to the program

 Apart from the Indian batsmen, Team India's fast bowler has also ravaged the opponents
 mohammad shami ne abhi tak 17, jabaki umesh yadav ne 14 or mohit sharma ne 11 wicket chatkaaye hai
 It is worth noting that he is the same fast bowler of Team India, who is generally considered to be weak and Captain Cool Mahendra Singh Dhoni himself also took a dig at this
 samay kaa khel dekhie, jin gendbaajon par har ko kabhi syrius nahin liya ja rahaa tha, unhone worldcup main abhi tak virodhiyon ke 70 main se 43 wicket apane naam kiye hai
 India has since stepped on the Australian soil, the same question was being asked about how Indian batsmen face short pitch balls on bouncy pitches
 lekin teen maheene baad bhartiya tej gendbaaj short pich gendon kaa shandaar istemaal karke virdohi ballebaajon ke liye mushkilen paidaa kar rahe hai
 The special thing is that out of 43 wickets Indian fast bowlers have named, 25 wickets have been found on short balls
 kuch din pehle dhoni ne apni teen saal pehle kii press conference kaa zikr kiya tha, jab unase isisi ke prati over do bounsar kii sweekruti dene ke bare main poocha gaya tha
 Dhani had said, 'if one bouncer is not put properly, can i take two bouncers home
 'us din vyangy se bhare captain kool ke is bayaan ko ulatney ke liye bhartiya tej gendbaajon ne kadi mehnat kii
 It is but natural that fast bowlers get more wickets in Australia, but there is also a truth that never before has the Indian team used the pitch so well
 toornament main mohammad shami kii jagah ekmaatr match khilne vaale bhuvaneshwar kumaar ne bhi ek wicket hasil kiya he
 Of these, Mohit used the bouncer effectively, as he can control his pace with the bouncer
 mohit 130 kimi prati ghanta ke aasapaas raftaar vaali gend se achaanak 140 kimi prati ghanta kii raftaar vaali gend daal sakate hai
 Former Pakistan fast bowler and UAE current coach Aqib Javed recently said in Perth, 'mohit's bouncer is the most effective
 yahaan tak ki dhoni bhi is baat se sahamat hai ki mohit short ball kaa shandaar istemaal karte hai

 After the victory in Bihar by-election, former Chief Minister of the state Rabri Devi has attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party fiercely

 At the same time, Rabri took a dig at the bjp's defeat in the UP elections and said that just as Atal Bihari Vajpayee's India Shining slogan was drowned, in the same way every time Modi's house-to-house Modi's slogan will fly in the air
 unhone kaha kivipakshke saare netaa ekajute ho rahe hai or is ekajutata se sirf bihar hi nahin, balki puure desh main saamaajik nyaay kii sarkaar banegi
 Let us know that out of the elections held in two assembly and one Lok Sabha seats in Bihar, BJP could win only one seat (vidhan Sabha, Bhabhua)

 When the country's import value is more than its export value, it is called current account deficit

 The reason for their divorce was that Ranjit always left a wet towel on the bed

 This was the reason that the two decided to separate

 Writer Salman Rushdie is no longer coming to attend the Jaipur Literature Festival
 unhen majabuuran yah kadam uthaanaa padaa he
 The way the Rajasthan government worked to encourage those who raised their voice against their participation is sad
 salmaan rushdi ne kaha he, ''pichley kai dinon se maine rajasthan ke sthaneey prashasan ke anurodh par jaipur sahitya utsav par saarvajanik rup se koi tippanee nahin kii he
 i was hoping that they would be able to take such precautionary measures that would make it possible for me to come there and i would be able to address the people present in the festival in an environment that would be safe and comfortable for all
 ''unhone kaha ki unhen maharashtra or rajasthan khufia sutron se pataa chalaa he ki mumbai anderworld ke logon ko meri hatya kii supaari de di gai he or ve jaipur ke liye nikal chuke hai
 He says, "although i do not have full confidence in the veracity of this intelligence
" lekin agar main in paristhitiyon main utsav main aata hum to yah mere parivaar, utsav ke darshakon or mere saathi lekhakon ke prati gaiyr jimmedaarana hoga
 So i will not be able to come to Jaipur anymore
 '' jis tarah se kattarpathiyon ko lekar sarkaar kaa ravaiya rahaa he, usase bhavishya main is sahitya utsav kaa sthaan badale jane kaa khatra bhi paidaa hota he
 Such issues are believed to be raised only for political interests

 is sanghathan ne 2010 main somalia kii lekhika ayaan hirsi ali ko aamantrit karne ke liye bhi utsav par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Actually looking at the elections in Uttar Pradesh, Gehlot wants to please the Muslims

 In such a situation, making Rushdie's journey a political issue, suits Gehlot

" ''baat apane khilaaf jate dekh gahalot ne bhaajapa par aarope madh diya ki usne rushdi kii yatra ko tool diya
 It is his style that he makes rhetoric, and when it starts to backfire, starts accusing the BJP
 haalanki aayojak or adhikari is koshish main lage the ki rushdi kii yatra ko lekar shorsharaba tham jaae lekin aisa nahin ho sakaa
 By the way, the organizers were also concerned that the excessive attention given to Rushdie diverts attention from 258 other writers

 rohit ne kaha, ‘uski baat chodo
 He has just returned (after the ban)
 mujhe nahin lagata ki hamen usko lekar bahut utsahit hona chahie
 Now let him play for one more year and then we will see if he is capable
 ’har baar khud ko sabit kare aamiraunhone kaha, ‘vah acha gendbaaj he lekin use har baar khud ko sabit karnaa hoga
 It is not good to give him so much attention after only one match

 vah ek aam gendbaaj haiunhone kaha, ‘log uski tulana wasim akram se kar rahe hai
 Let him get something
 vah pratibhashali he lekin aisa kuch nahin he ki wo sabko uda hi detaa he

 ’ rohit se poocha gaya ki vah pratibandh ke baad aamir kii vaapasi ke khilaaf the, ‘yah meri chintaa nahin he
 This is his politics, his case
 meri isamen koi dilchaspee nahin he
 i have nothing to say on this
 ’aamir kii nahin, bumraah kii tarif karenrohit ne yuva tej gendbaaj bumraah kii tarif kii or media se aagrah kiya ki vah aamir ke bajaay is bhartiya kaa gungan karen
 He said, 'instead of talking about Aamir, you should talk about Bumrah

 The way he started he would do something special
 ’behtareen gendbaaj he bumrahrohit ne kaha ki apane sling ection ke kaaran bumraah ko nets par khelnaa bhi aasaan nahin hota

 He was keeping his arms

 Yoguru Baba Ramdev has retaliated on Sitaram Yechury's statement of Hindu violence
 baba ramdev ne kaha ki seetaram yechuri ko apana naam ravan rakh lenaa chahie
 Our ancestors have done acts of valor not cruelty, firs should be lodged against it in the whole country
 ajtak se khaas baatcheet ke dauraan baba ramdev ne kaha 'communiston ne apane vichaar failaane ke liye puri duniya main hatyaein kii hai
 More than 300 million people have been killed for the expansion of Christians all over the world
 mughalon ne apane samrajya ke vistaar ke liye 10 karod se zyada logon kii hatyaein kii hai
 The Hindu is tolerant, so anyone tells us something
 sawaal-kya hinduon ne gaddi hasil karne ke liye hatyaein nahin kii?jawaab-vyakti ke bheetar hinsa hona uskaa prakritik swabhaav he
 All society consists of violent people
 chunaav ayog ko sitaram yechuri kaa namakan radd kar dena chahie
 They should be behind bars of prison
 kisi bhi hinsa kaa, aatank kaa koi dharm nahin hota
 It is a distortion within a person
 main kisi chunaav prachaar ke liye nahin aayaa hum
 i have come forward to defend my views
 main aadarshon par chalane vaala vyakti hum
 i have read the original texts that there is no mention of violence anywhere in them
 hamaari sabhyataa samskruti ko koi gaali degaa to ham use bilkul bardaasht nahin karenge
 Question - Your words will not polarize? Answer - i am against any kind of communal polarization
 main jati, dharm ke aadhaar par hone vaale dhruvikaran ke sakht khilaaf hum
 i have never considered caste
 kisi bhi prakaar kaa dhruvikaran desh ke liye khatarnaak he
 Question- You told Sitaram Yechury that the name should be changed to Ahmad Shah, is that right? Answer - Communists do not believe in God, but they kept their name 'sitaram'
 maine kaha agar aap sach main ramayana, mahabharat ko kaalpanik maanate ho to ye naam kyon rakhaa he?, lekin in communiston ko sita-ram kaa naam aate hi naaraazgi kyon hoti he?sawaal-chaar charnon ke chunaav ke baad aapaki entry ho rahi he,kyon?jawaab-main kisi raajnneetik prachaar ke liye nahin aayaa hum
 i have come to tell the communist brothers to take political ideology from anywhere, but take cultural ideology from their ancestors
 sawaal-sadhvi pragna ke liye kya prachaar karenge?jawaab-desh ke karodon logon ke liye main hameshaa khadaa hum, jo bhi desh ke logon ko ke liye acha hoga wo main karuunga
 Question- The fight for black money is over? Answer- Black money, corruption, slavery everywhere, i am against all this
 pehle bhi vahi vichaar the aaj bhi mere yahi vichaar hai
 If someone talks about breaking the country, i will not tolerate it
 main kisi raajnneetik manshaa ko lekar nahin aayaa hum
 i consider my ancestors to be my god
 main apane dharm ke liye aage aayaa hum
 Question- Baba Ramdev is afraid of talking black money in front of this government? Answer - Still black money is the issue
 40-60 karod log aise hai jinka jivan behatar banane kii aavashyaktaa he
 Everyone will have to forward two hands
 main kabhi bhi vibhaajan vaali soch se sahamat nahin hum
 i am always with him who will take the nation forward
 modi ji kaa jo netritv he wo himalay jaisaa he
 This is the truth, i am not a devotee
 gauratlab he ki shuukravaar ko sipiem netaa seetaram yechuri ne kaha tha ki ramayana or mahabharat bhi ladaai or hinsa se bhari hui thim, lekin ek prachaarak ke taur aap sirf mahakavy ke taur par use bataate hai, uske baad bhi daawa karte hai ki hindu hinsak nahin he
 After this statement, politics is hot
 bijepi netaa giriraaj singh ne bhi bayaan par naaraazgi jataate hue kaha ki desh kaa durbhaagya he ki jo hinduon ko jitani gaali detaa he vah utana zyada secular kehalaata he

 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav kaa matdaan jari he
 The fight between Congress and BJP is considered to be a thorn contest
 vahiin jedies kingmekar kii bhoomika ke liye jaddojahad kar rahi he
 BJP is looking forward to feeding lotus in Karnataka with the help of BS Yeddyurappa's face
 yediurppa ke saath-saath bijepi or sangh kaa bhi majboot garh maane jane vaala ilaaka tateey karnataka (costal kshetra) he
 The BJP and RSS Hindutva laboratory in Karnataka is in this coastal belt
 tateey karnataka ilaake main pichley chunaav main yediurppa kii baghawat kaa khamiyaja bijepi ko bhugatna padaa tha
 At the same time, Congress got the benefit of this
 ab jab yediurppa phir bijepi ke liye khewanhaar bane hue hai or party hindutv kii siyaasi bisaat bichaane main juty he
 In such a situation, the contest in the coastal Karnataka region has become interesting
 tateey karnatakashetra ke tahat mangaluru, udupi or karwaar chikmaglur jile kii kareeb 20 vidhansabha siten aati he
 Anant Kumar Hegde, a minister in the central government and a firebrand leader of the Karnataka BJP, hails from Karwar district
 paanch baar ke saansad hegade kii pahchaan rajya main hindutv ke chehre ke taur par he
 In the 2013 assembly elections, the BJP had to fight expensively to contest Yeddyurappa's separation
 party ko baari nuksaan uthaanaa padaa tha
 Congress got 13 seats from this strong fort of BJP in the last assembly elections
 jabaki bijepi ko mahaj 3 siten mili thi
 Congress got 43 per cent of the votes in terms of vote share
 jabaki bijepi ko 34 fisadi, jedies ko 9 or anya ko 13 fisadi vot mili the
 Only a year after the assembly elections, did the Yeddyurappa return to the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the party performed very well
 party ke costal kshetra main kareeb 55 fisadi vot mili, jabaki congress ko 3 fisadi vot kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa or use 40 fisadi vot mili
 Only the entire vote of JDS went to BJP
 jedies ko mahaj 0
 Got 3 percent votes
 2014 ke matdaan pattern ko vidhansabha kshetra ke maddenjar dekha jaae to bijepi 17 vidhansabha siton par aage rahi, jabaki congress keval 3 siton par aage rahi he
 BJP is desperate to repeat the performance in the assembly elections on the lines of Lok Sabha
 yahi vajah he ki anant hegade se lekar upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke jariye bijepi ne is ilaake main hindutv card khelaa he
 It is very difficult for the Congress to repeat the results of the last election
 yahi vajah he ki siddharmaiya dakshini karnataka ke saath-saath uttar karnataka kii seat par kismat aajamaa rahe hai
 Through this, they are trying to resolve both areas

 com / hftqsddpew On Monday, after its first patrolling in the sea, a nuclear-powered submarine INS Arihant returned home
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne arihant kii team kaa swaagat kiya or is pandubbi ko dushmano ke liye chunauti bataaya
 With this, the Indian Army is now equipped with the capability to respond to an atomic attack on land, sea and air
 piem modi ne arihant kii team ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'aapkaa ye abhiyaan suraksha or sangraksha ke liye tapasya he
 Arihant means to destroy enemies
 ye desh kii suraksha ke liye uplabdhi he
 Is a big step
 'WATCH: Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses the crew of INS Arihant which returned from its first deterrence patr


https: / / t
 co / z7wx4rlwna— ANI (@ANI) November 5, 2018 The Prime Minister further said, 'arihant is an open warning to the enemies of India that no one should dare against India
 sara bharat aapkaa (arihant) kritagya he
 This is today's success which India has achieved on its own
 ' unhone kaha, 'bharat ek shantipurna desh he
 This is not our weakness
 ye hamaari shakti he
 India does not tease anyone but if it teases anyone, it does not leave it
 'ienes arihant ke sena main shaamil hone se bharat ab tihare atomi hamale kaa maarak jawaab de saktaa he
 Agni missiles on land, air combat aircraft and Arihant in water India can easily respond to nuclear attacks by means of 
 piem modi ne kaha, 'ienes arihant ke kaaran newclear trid hasil karte hue bharat elit deshon ke saath khadaa ho gaya he
 Prime Minister Modi congratulated all crew members for the successful patrolling of Arihant
 piem ne kaha ki bharat kaa newclear trid aitihaasik he kyonki yah duniya main shanti or sthirataa ke liye mahatvapurn sabit hoga
 While informing the countrymen on the occasion of Dhanteras, PM Modi tweeted, 'today Dhanteras has become special
 bharat kaa gaurav, atomi hathiyaaron se las ieen arihantne apana pehla petrol puraa kar liya he
 i congratulate all crew members who completed this historic work
 'china or pakistan ke maddenjar suraksha kii jaruraton par bal dete hue piem ne kaha ki aaj ke jamaane main atomi nivaaran vakt hi maang he
 Atomic deterrence implies that India has decided not to use an atomic weapon first but can do so when another country attacks it
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne khaadya suraksha vidheyak ko ‘aitihaasik’ bataate hue shanivaar ko party netaaon se kaha ki iske sandesh ko jamini str tak lekar jaaen or janata ko kanoonee adhikaron ke liye sangharsh karne ke lihaaj se taiyaar karen
 Rahul Gandhi addressed the meeting of the state Congress chiefs and Congress Legislature Party leaders on the issue of food security
 unke saath kendriya mantri jairam ramesh or kevi thomas ne bhi sambodhit kiya
 There was also a demand in the meeting that the Food Security Act be named after the late former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, and Congress leaders should be widely involved in implementing it in the opposition-ruled states
 baithak main shaamil ek netaa ne bataaya ki baithak main rahul ke praarambhik bhaashan kaa labolubaab yahi tha, ‘hamane unhen ek adhikaar diya he
 You prepare them for the struggle
 ’ rahul ne kaha ki congress party shiksha kaa adhikaar, soochna kaa adhikaar, rojgaar kaa adhikaar (manaregaa), pahchaan kaa adhikaar (aadhaar) dene jaise vaayadon ko puraa karne ke baad bhojan kaa adhikaar lekar ai he
 Rahul told the participants, 'for the first time in the history of the country, a government is enacting a law to give citizens the right to food
 aap is sandesh ko blokon or gaanvon main lekar jaaen
 Amidst concern over discrepancies in the public distribution system, Rahul expressed confidence that the bill gives legal rights to the public, hence it will put pressure on institutions and there will be changes at the surface level
 ek pratibhaagi netaa ne kaha, ‘unka vichaar he ki kanoonee adhikaar peedies main khaamiyon ko paatega
 Giving it legal status will put pressure on the system and there will be changes at the lower level
 ’jammu kashmir pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh safuddin soj ne baithak main rahul ke sambodhan ke hawaale se kaha, ‘pehle hamen puri cheez ko sahi se samajhnaa chahie or uske baad party kaaryakartaaon ko logon ko samajhane main madad kerani chahie
 The Government of India is bringing this bill which will bring changes in the lives of people at the level at which people have struggled
 ’unhone yah bhi kaha ki vidheyak ko achaanak adhyadesh ke taur par nahin laayaa gaya he
 It is believed that Rahul said, 'we made this promise in 2009
 jab vipakshi dalon ne hamen sansad main ise paarit nahin karne diya to ham adhyadesh lekar aae
 In Punjab, Congress Legislature Party leader Sunil Jakhar said that there are 12,000 such affidavits in which people have said that they did not get kerosene and grains from PDS shops
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki kisaanon ke bich ashanka he ki yojana se sabsidi par roak lagegi
 Rahul, Thomas and Ramesh tried to allay the fears of the leaders
 rahul ne kaha ki party kaaryakartaaon ko kisaanon ko bataanaa chahie ki upie ke shashan ke dauraan anaaj par sabsidi kam karne kii koi yojana nahin he
 Thomas said the government would announce a separate issue to address the farmers' fears
 kuch pradesh congress adhyakshon or congress vidhayak dal ke netaaon ne yah chintaa bhi jataai ki vipaksh shasit rajyon main labhaarthiyon kii suchi banane main or yojana ko lagu karne main bade str par dhaandhlee hogi
 Thomas said that there are provisions for the State Food Commission and District Level Grievance Redressal System, but in the federal structure, the states have to implement the plan
 punjab pradesh congress adhyaksh pratap singh bajva ne baithak main kaha ki vipakshi dal jab centre kii yojanaon ko lagu karte hai to unke mukhyamantriyon or mantriyon kii tasviren lagaate hai or puraa shrey le jate hai
 Bajwa said that a system should be created so that the opposition parties also have a role in the implementation of the plan
 madhya pradesh ke congress vidhayak dal ke netaa ajay singh ne kaha ki rahul ne unase is vidheyak ke mahatv ke bare main jaankariyon ko janata ke bich prachaarit karne ko kaha
 Singh also said that it would be wrong to associate this bill with elections
 sutron ke mutabik khaadya mantri ke ve thomas ne baithak main kaha ki logon ke bich yah galat dharna he ki is kanoon ke lagu ho jane ke baad saarvajanik vitaran pranali (peedies) samaapt ho jaaegi
 He asked the partymen to put an end to this notion
 balika vadhoo serial se mashhoor hui pratyusha banerjee ke suicide cese main ek chaunkaane vaala khulaasa hua he
 Investigation revealed that Pratyusha was pregnant
 uskaa aborshan bhi hua tha
 Pratyusha embraced death only four weeks after the abortion
 pratyusha ke toote sapane hi use niraashaa ke us bhavar main le gaye, jahaan wo khud hi apni jaan le baithi
 Pratyusha's suicide was linked to his family, friends and relatives with love failure
 isi bich police jaanch main ye chaunkaane vaala khulaasa hua he
 According to the information, Mumbai Police has confirmed that Pratyusha Banerjee had an abortion before suicide
 jeje hospital ke doctoron kaa maananaa he ki pratyusha ne 1 april ko suicide karne se lagbhag 4 hafte pehle aborshan karaayaa tha
 Histopathological examination of the uterus tissue was performed
 usee ke baad ye khulaasa hua he
 According to histopathological report Pratyusha's uterine infection was found
 ye infections yaa to misskarij se hota yaa phir garbhpaat karaane se hota he
 If the love stories remain incomplete, the consequences can be frightening
 pratyusha kii prem kahani bhi kuch aisi hi rahi
 She was desperate and lost her life
 ab insaaf kii jang main chaunkaane vaali kuch baaten bhi saamne aa rahi hai
 It has been revealed that Pratyusha was pregnant
 lekin kai muddon par rahul raaj kaa bartaav andeh main he
 She also did not deny that she lived with Pratyusha in the same flat where she was found hanging from the fan
 phir aisi mushkil ghadi main uskaa sabase kareebi use akelaa kaise chhod saktaa he
 Police questions, Rahul's answer to the inquiry officer - Was Pratyusha pregnant at the time of death? Rahul Raj - No
 jaanch adhikari-tumhaare saath rahane ke dauraan wo kabhi garbhvatee hui?rahul raaj-ji haa, janvari ke maheene main hui thi
 When is the investigating officer in January? Rahul raj-date is not remembered, probably in the first week of January
 jaanch adhikari-pratyusha ne aborshan kab karaayaa?rahul raaj-march ke pehle yaa duusare hafte main karaayaa tha
 Investigating Officer - Did you and Pratyusha seek medical advice before abortion? Rahul raj-pratyusha consulted a gynecologist
 jaanch adhikari-kya tum aspataal main uske saath the?rahul raaj-nahin, wo akeli gai thi, main biji tha
 Now the investigation of the police is going on with the same tip that what happened between Rahul Raj and Pratyusha is that Rahul has turned away from him even at such a time
 glamer kii chakachaundh bhari duniya ke peeche kitna andhera he, pratyusha banerjee kii maut kii kahani isaki jiti jaagti misaal he
 He got the name, got the work, got the fame, got the wealth, but his love took him behind the glamor into the anonymous darkness
 halaat us mode tak pahunche, jahaan maut ke sivaa koi rasta nahin bachaa tha
 It would not be wrong to call Roopasa Batwyal, the winner of Super Dancer 3, the goddess of dance
 aisa koun-sa dance style he jise rupasa kar nahin sakati
 Roopasa is the pride of super dancer
 mahaj 6 saal kii umr main rupasa ne apane dance muves se sabhi ko kaayal kar diya he
 Roopasa is the queen of expression
 lekin aapako jaanakar hairaani hogi ki rupasa kabhi bhi apana berthde celibratt nahin karti he
 His mother has revealed the reason behind this
 india today se baatcheet main rupasa kii maa ne bataaya- ham kabhi bhi rupasa kaa berthde celibratt nahin karte hai
 Because whenever a happy occurance occurs, Rupasa becomes ill
 wo is vajah se kabhi bhi durga puja main nahin gai or na hi usne kabhi apana janmdin manaaya or pados ke bacchon ko kabhi inwite bhi nahin kiya
 We cut the cake with the family on his birthday
 rupasa jab bhi bahut excited hoti he to biimaar pad jaati he
 Let me tell you that at the age of 6 she dances like a professional dancer
 rekha ne rupasa ke pair chhue to shilpa shetty ne rupasa ke pairon ko choomaa
 Many guests like Raveena Tandon, Micah Singh, Tiger Shroff, Salman Khan were surprised to see Roopasa's dance
 bataa den ki rupasa kolkata kii rahane vaali he
 The economic condition of his family is not very good
 lekin unke parents ne rupasa ko dance sikhaaya he
 Roopasa's mother once told in the show that the place where she lives in Kolkata is very small
 logon kii soch bhi acchhee nahin he
 When i took Roopasa for a dance and returned late in the evening, people used to look at me incorrectly
 lekin aaj meri beti ne un sabko jawaab de diya he
 Salman Khan is at the moment confused
 guuruuvaar ko unki paaltu dogi 'maay lav' kii maut ho gai
 Salman expressed his grief among contestants and the audience in Bigg Boss's Weekend Ka Vaar
 saath hi unhone apni dogi kaa ek video bhi dikhaaya
 Salman said in front of all the contestants - "I lost my dog the day before yesterday
 yadi vah aaj jivit hoti to anup jalota, jasline or deepak thakur se behatar singer hoti
 Certainly she would take part in some singing show
 "kisses my love

 "salmaan ne jo video dikhaaya usamen unki dogi ek gane ke saath lay milaati dikh rahi he
 Seeing this, Salman and all the family became emotional
 video dekhne ke baad jasline ne kaha ki vaaki ye mujhase acchhee singer he or mujhase zyada kute bhi he
 Let me tell you that the war of the weekend at home was heavier than Saurabh Patel
 kam voton kii vajah se unhen big bos ne ghar se beghar hone kaa aadesh suna diya
 After Neha Pendse, Saurabh is considered by the lowest entertainment member audience in the house

 If i get a good chance, i would like to pursue the acting career
 rashtriya janata dal ne bihar main adhikariyon ke tabadale ko lekar mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par hamalaa bolaa he
 The RJD has accused Nitish Kumar of appointing a 'controversial officer' under pressure from one of his ministers
 rajd ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh shivanand tiwari kaa kahana he ki apni zarurat ke anusaar padaadhikariyon kaa sthanantaran or padasthaapan sarkaar kaa adhikaar he, magar iske liye kuch niyam, qaayade, or paramparayen bani hui hai
 Governments are expected to take care of them when they transfer or post office bearers
 agar aisa nahin hota he to sarkaar par oongli uthne lagati he or unke niyat par shaq-shubahaa hone lagata he
 Shivanand Tiwari said in a statement that 'nitish Kumar has done one such thing which is causing a finger on him
 log sarkaar kii niyat par andeh kar rahe hai
 An officer holding the post of Development Commissioner has been transferred to the post of Secretary, Department of Water Resources
 pichley 31 aktubar ko hi jal sansaadhan vibhaag se badalakar unako vikaas ayukta banaaya gaya tha
 They are not counted in office bearers with a very clean image
 nitish ji ke mitra or jharkhand sarkaar ke mantri sarayu raay ne ek patr likh kar ukt padaadhikari par gambhir aarope lagaaya tha
 According to 'shivanand', the biggest thing is that the office-bearers posted as development commissioners have either retired from there or been made chief secretaries
 abhi haal main shishir kumaar or negi ne vikaas ayukta ke pad se hi avkaas grahan kiya he
 So what is the secret of returning to the same post from the post of Development Commissioner! If Nitish Kumar's Khasham-specific minister was sitting with the corresponding officer, then why was he removed from there
 chaahe jo ho, jal sansaadhan mantri kii ichha puri karne kii laalasaa main nitish ji ne apane upar saarvajanik rup se kaalikh pot lee he
 In fact, Shivanand Tiwari is again questioning the appointment of a senior officer named Arun Singh to the Water Resources Department
 mana jaataa he ki arun, vibhaag ke mantri lalan singh ke manapsand hai or nitish arun singh ke vikaas ayukta ke kaam kaaj se asantusht chal rahe the, uske baavjood ab janata dal ke netaaon kaa maananaa hai ki waapas laalan singh ke dabaav main aakar tripurari sharan jaise eemaandaar adhikari ko kuch maheene main vibhaag se chalata kar nitish ne raajnneeti or sarkaar main apni kamazoriyon ke bare main hi logon ko anguli uthaane kaa mauqaa diya he
 Have you ever seen the bridegroom being photographed with a toilet seat for the wedding
 are, chaunkiye mat aisa sach main ho rahaa he
 In Sihor district of Madhya Pradesh, grooms wishing to get married with their home-made toilet seats are photographed so that they can use it as a proof in a community wedding organized by the state government under the 'mukhyamantri Kanyadan Yojana'
 darasal, rajya sarkaar ne 'mukhyamantri kanyadan yojana' ke tahat yah jaruri kar diya he ki samuhik vivaah ke liye keval unheen ladakon kaa registration hoga, jinke ghar main shauchalay he
 Under 'mukhyamantri Kanyadan Yojana', the state government gives Rs 15,000 in cash and many gifts to the married couple
 aise main sambhavit duulhe is shart ko puraa karne main koi kor-kasar nahin chhod rahe hai
 According to the officials, to get the registration done under the 'mukhyamantri Kanyadan Yojana', the groom desirous of marriage needs to submit a photo of himself with a toilet seat to prove that he has a toilet in his house
 gauratlab he ki kendriya gramin vikaas mantralay gramin ilaakon main swatchta ke buniyadi dhaanche ke liye rajya sarkaar ko dhan muhaiyaa karaata he
 But the Madhya Pradesh government has cleverly linked it to the Chief Minister Kanyadan Yojana
 rajyasabha saansad or varsh 2008 main hue cash for vot maamle main aaropee amar singh ne somvaar ko jamaanat ke liye dilli hoicourt main guhaar lagaai
 On 28 September, Singh's appeal for interim bail and regular bail was dismissed by a Delhi court
 adaalat ne kaha tha ki sansadeey loktantr ko apamaanit karne vaale is puure maamle main unki bhoomika badi thi
 After this, Singh has taken shelter of the High Court
 nichali adaalat ne apane aadesh main kaha tha ki yah maamla bataata he ki singh, or is maamle main giraftaar bhaajapa netaaon sahit anya raajnneetik padaadhikariyon ne jo kiya, vah kalpana se pare tha or yah sab sansad kii karypranali ko nuksaan pahunchane ke liye kiya gaya
 Singh, currently undergoing treatment at AIIMS, has sought bail on medical grounds
 unki swasthya sambandhi report main unke swasthya main sudhaar bataaya gaya he, lekin unke gurdon kii sankraman kii ashanka ke chalate lagaataar jaanch kii jarurat he
 Amar Singh reached the court on 6 September as a summons for his alleged involvement in the note scam case
 iske baad unhen giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 He was brought to AIIMS from Tihar Jail on the evening of 12 September after complaining of vomiting and diarrhea and was granted interim bail on 15 September

 "we are working on it," he said at the Northeast Conference organized by Northeast Liaison Cell of Karnataka BJP
 nasli krityon ke maamle main ham kadi karrwai karenge
 Our stand on this is clear
 'samudaay ke andar or baahar jaagarukta kii aavashyaktaa par bal dete hue unhone kaha, 'keval purvottar ke logon se hi bhedbhaav nahin ho rahaa he
 There are also cases of South Indians, they feel that they are discriminated against in North India and there are others who feel that they are being discriminated against in Northeast India
 'purvottar samudaay ke baatcheet karte hue unhone kaha, 'yah ek chunauti he, nasli aadhaar par kisi bhi bhedbhaav ko hamen khatm karnaa chahie

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne lakshmanarav inaamdaar ke janmashti samaaroh main kaha ki maharashtra ke rahane vaale inaamdaar ek aise vyakti the jo parde ke peeche rahakar kaam karte the or desh main sahakaarita andolan ko aage badhaane ke liye unhone mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 His workplace was Gujarat
 unke janm shatee diwas ko sahakaarita diwas ke rup main manaaya gaya
 Let me tell you that this person, known as Vivek Babu, had a big role in the life of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and on one side was also the mentor of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 lakshmanarav inaamdaar ko modi kaa raajnneetik guru bhi mana jaataa he
 In 1969, Inamdar ran a large cooperative movement called Sahakar Bharti
 is maukey par pradhanmantri ne lakshmanarav inaamdaar se judi do kitabon kaa vimochan bhi kiya
 Modi and lawyer Sahabamodi have drawn inspiration only from the bronze statues of Sardar Patel and the calendars of Swami Vivekananda
 lekin vakil sahab kahalaane vaale inaamdaar kaa zikr aane par kahani main terning point aa jaataa he
 According to Seshadri Chari, a member of the bjp's national executive, Narendra Modi spent his early years in the Sangh and the lawyer was the biggest influence on him
 is maukey par modi ne kaha ki ab jarurat is baat kii he ki sahakaarita ke kshetra main kaam karne vaale log madhumakhi paalan or si vid, yani samandar ke pani main paidaa hone vaali vanaspati ko ugaakar 2022 tak kisaanon kii aamadani doguna karne ke lakshya ko puraa karen
 Modi said that if the condition of farmers in the country is to improve and the goal of doubling their income is to be achieved, the cooperative sector will have to play a bigger role for this
 shwet kranti kaa udhaaharan dete hue pradhanmantri ne kaha ki doodh ke utpaadan main sahakaarita ne aisi bhoomika nibhaai, jisase kisaanon kii jindagi puri tarah badal gai
 For the cooperative to be successful, it is necessary that the farmer can buy the goods he needs at wholesale prices and sell his produce at retail prices to avoid profiteering by middlemen
 unhone kaha ki desh main philhal sthiti aisi he ki kisaanon ko puri keemat nahin milti, lekin bichauliye uskaa phayda uthaa lete hai
 But this will not happen if the role of cooperatives is large
 modi ne kaha ki philhal desh ke zyaadaatar hisson main sahakaarita chini or doodh ke utpaadan tak simit he lekin vahaan pratispardhaa bahut bad chuki he
 Therefore, it is necessary that the success of cooperatives should be tried in new areas
 modine dilli ke vigyaan bhawan main yojit samaaroh main sahakaarita kshetra ke logon ko kai nae suzav die, jisamen sahakaarita kii bhoomika ho sakati he
 The Prime Minister said that since the production of Neem Coated Urea has started in the country, the consumption and requirement of Neem has increased a lot
 aise main neem ke patton or falon ko jamaa karnaa unka utpaadan karnaa or unhen bhejnaa sahakaarita ke liye ek nayaa kshetra ho saktaa he
 Similarly, by increasing beekeeping on a large scale, farmers can increase their income from it
 modi ne kaha ki is machhlee paalan main lage logon ke liye barsaat kaa mausam mushkil bharaa hota he kyonki us samay mausam kii vajah se samandar main janaa bahut kam ho jaataa he
 In such a situation, farmers can cultivate cvid by the sea by forming a cooperative society, which is in great demand in the field of medicine nowadays

 When Prime Minister Narendra Modi chose the day of November 8 to announce the ban on demonetisation, people did not know its ear till evening
 ghoshnaa ke chand minuton pehle khabar ai ki pradhanmantri desh ko sambodhit karne vaale hai
 There has been speculation that Modi can say something important from surgical strike to politics
 lekin hua in sabase ulat
 The announcement was a 500 and 1000 note ban
 lekin bhaajapa dwaara aitihaasik ghoshit kiye gaye is faisle ko lekar hi tarah-tarah kii shankaaen sir uthaa rahi hai
 Doubts are being expressed about the timing and intent of the announcement
 aise kathanak saamne hai jo sarkaar dwaara prachaarit byore ko galat bataate hai yaa unki satyata par sawaal uthaate hai
 For example, the latest reports are the purchase of land by the Bharatiya Janata Party just before demonetisation
 kuch samachar madhyamon ne is baat kaa khulaasa kiya he ki bhartiya janata party ne notebandi se thik pehle bihar main karodon rupee kii zamin kharidi he
 Not only this, the BJP leaders of Bihar have also admitted that cash payment has also been made to purchase the land
 yah paisa logon ne party ko chande ke taur par diya tha
 According to the BJP leaders of Bihar itself, the party has bought many lands not only in the state but across the country till the first week of November
 inamen se kuch zamin kharid ke kaagazat bhi saamne aae hai jinamein party ke padaadhikariyon kaa naam he or kahin kahin par party ke dilli pate se party ke hi naam par zamin kharidi gai he
 There are more questions before this information is also revealed that just before the announcement of November 8 by the Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party, three crore rupees have been deposited in the party's account
 is raashi kaa ek hissaa 500 or 1000 ke noton main tha
 Doubts are being raised on the basis of these reports whether the party people had got information before the announcement of demonetisation
 yaa kya party main notebandi ke sanket de die gaye the
 Satyendra Murali, a young journalist working in Doordarshan, told a press conference on Thursday that the Prime Minister's address which was shown live on Doordarshan from 8 pm on November 8 was actually pre-recorded
 isse sarkaar kii ore se notebandi kii ghoshnaa se sambandhit jo jaankaree di gai he, wo juthi sabit ho sakati he
 However, some people believe that the party is in power and constantly buys and keeps some things in the interest of the party
 aise main ek rashtriya party ke liye ye rashiyaan choti hai or inase itnaa bada laabh nahin hone vaala ki pradhanmantri apni sachai ko daanv par laga den
 Modi on target but if there is truth in these things then it is a very bad news for Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 wo isliye ki is faisle ke liye wo khud zimmedaar hai
 It was his decision, not the party's
 party or mantrimandal ke sadasyon ko to antim samay tak iskaa andaaza tak nahin tha
 Neither the finance minister Arun Jaitley nor the RBI governor Urjit Patel were with him when the Prime Minister himself came to the public to announce
 yah ek awaz or ek chehre ke saath kii gai ghoshnaa thi jisamen shrey keval ek vyakti ko janaa tha or wo hai pradhanmantri narendra modi
 But even if the credit is not distributed, the charges are not distributed
 rah-rahakar jo baaten or jo andeh saamne aa rahe hai, wo agar kisi ek ko apana nishaanaa bana rahe hai to wo hai narendra modi
 And this is because this decision is Modi's own decision and he has taken it
 sarkaar bhi yahi kahati he or party bhi
 That is, if the Prime Minister's declaration of credit for the surgical strike on black money deepens and the irregularity in facts can be proved, then it will directly affect Modi's own image
 modi or unki party pehle hi is ghoshnaa ke zamin par arajak hote jane kii chintaaon se chintit hai
 But if the motives and evidence behind this announcement prove to be double, then Modi will become more surrounded and weakened
 yah modi kaa apana bhaag hoga or isamen unki party tak hissedaar nahin ho sakegi

 May also be affected

 The demand for the dismissal of Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni intensified following the series defeat on Monday at the hands of England
 mahaan ballebaaj sunil gavaskar ke alaava kai purv cricketer jaise purv mukhya chayankarta ke shrikant, atul vaasan or abbaas alig beg unhen hataane kii baat kar rahe hai
 After India's poor performance in the last 18 months, these people want to replace the Test captain and Virat Kohli's name is being suggested in his place
 england ne nagpur main aaj yahaan chauthaa or antim test dra karake 2-1 kii jeet ke saath bharat main 28 baras baad test shrinkhalaa jiti
 Gavaskar then said that the time has come for the selectors to focus on the future as Dhoni did not appear to be in rhythm in the series
 purv bhartiya captain gavaskar ne kaha, ‘is test ke chauthe din tak main kahata rahaa ki mahendra singh dhoni kaa koi vikalp nahin he lekin viraat ke mushkil halaat main shatak jadne ke baad mujhe lagata he ki usne apane bare main acchhee cheez khoj lee he
 i think he is ready to take responsibility
 ’gavaskar ne kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki isaki ore sakaaratmak tareeke se dekha janaa chahie kyonki yaheen bhavishya he
 Srikkanth believes that Dhoni can prove to be much better without the burden of captaincy
 shrikant ne kaha, ‘dhoni kii captaini neeras ho gai he or vah nahin jaan paa rahaa he ki jab chijen haath se chhot raheen hai to kya karnaa he
 He should not be Test captain from now on
 agar main chayankartaaon kaa adhyaksh hota to main dhoni ko wicketiper or ballebaaj ke rup main team main chunata
 "srikanth said," i choose Dhoni as the wicket-keeper and batsman because his contribution to cricket is very important
 mujhe lagata he ki agar vah captaini nahin karegaa to team ko zyada behatar yogadan de saktaa he
 Former cricketer Abbas Ali Baig also demanded a change in captaincy and said Kohli should be given this responsibility
 unhone kaha, ‘hamen bhavishya ke bare main sochna hoga or isi ke anusaar yojana banani hogi
 Dhoni came to be called 'captain Cool' after winning the 2007 World Twenty20 Championship, but his poor performance in the last two years on foreign soil raised questions
 england ke haathon gharelu shrinkhalaa ganvaane se, madhyakram ballebaaj rahul dravid or vivies lakshmana ke sanyas lene ke baad bharat kii ballebaaji khamiyaan ujagar ho gayin
 Former Indian spinner Bishan Singh Bedi also demanded the removal of Dhoni from captaincy
 unhone kaha, ‘dhoni ko khud ko bhaagyashaalee maananaa chahie ki vah ab bhi vahaan (captain) he
 If Tiger Pataudi or Sunil Gavaskar had lost so many Tests, they would not have survived for so long
 "bedi said," He hasn't done much to remain captain
 use vishwa cap jeet ke baad hi hataa dena chahie tha
 'he asked,' he is not a Test captain
 aapako aise captain kii jarurat hoti he jo antim ekadash main apane sthaan kaa daavedaar ho
 Tell me that his 99 runs were of some use for the team
 ’ bedi kaa maananaa he ki kohli ko team kii kaman saunpny chahie
 He said, 'you can't say that we can't make another player a captain? i will make Virat Kohli the captain

 ’ Kejriwal's government in Delhi has decided that strict steps will be taken against private schools taking donations for admission
 shiksha nideshaalay ne bacchon ke parents ko raahate dete hue jari kiye aadesh main saaf kaha he ki admician ke liye bacchon or parents kaa koi test bhi nahin liya jayega
 Parents have complained many times about the admission of children in Delhi that donations are sought in schools
 shiksha nideshaalay ne rhite tu ajukeshan ke tahat yah aadesh jari kiya he
 The directorate has ordered all schools in Delhi to place instructions at the main gate of the school that no school can ask for donation at the time of admission as it is a punishable offense
 dilli kii jhuggi-jhopadi bastiyon main shauchalay shulk hataane ke abhiyaan ko pradesh bijepi ne mahila sammaan se joda he
 The party's National Minister Sardar RP Singh said that now the battle of mothers and sisters living in the 6 lakh slums of Delhi will not just end here, now the government should arrange for their free bath homes
 saath hi unhone kaha ki aisi kai suvidhaon se vanchit jhuggivaasiyon ko lekar party apane abhiyaan ko or tej karegi
 Significantly, Manoj Tiwari had migrated to the slums of Delhi in the past
 raatri vishram ke dauraan jhuggivaasiyon ne apni tamaam samasyaayein bijepi pradesh adhyaksh tiwari ke saamne rakhi thim
 The problem of toilets and bathrooms also came out
 tab tiwari ne is maamle ko dilli ke uparajyapal anil baijal ke samaksh sardaar aar pi singh ke saath ja kar rakhaa tha
 Taking cognizance of this, Anil Baijal issued a directive to remove the fee levied in the toilet
 is babat arapy singh ne bijepi ke pradesh mukhyalay main ek patrakaaravarta bulaai thi, jahaan patrakaron se baat karte hue singh ne kaha ki dilli kii 6 lakh jhuggiyon me lagbhag 18 lakh mahilaayein rahati hai or har maah snaan or shauchalay ke liye unase lagbhag 21 karod 60 lakh kii vasuuli kii jaati hai
 He said that the Delhi government, talking about the common man, is unaware of this major problem of women
 arapy singh ne kaha ki kharch se bachane ke liye lakhon mahilaayein khule main shouch or snaan karne ke liye majaboor hai
 He said that due to poverty and helplessness, lakhs of slum women are ashamed to defecate and bathe in the open
 lekin dilli kii besharm kejariwal sarkaar ke kaan par jun nahin reng rahaa he
 He said that while defecation in the open is hurting millions of women, due to such a system, there is an environment of filth and disease around the slums
