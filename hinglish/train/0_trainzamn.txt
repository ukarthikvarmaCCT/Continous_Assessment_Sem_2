 However, according to sources, it was argued in the meetings that if the change of leadership was done now, it would also be seen as a victory of the Jats after the agitation decided to give reservations to the movement
 lekin party main jis tarah antarvirodh gaharaa rahaa he, aane vaale samay main khatter ko hataane kii maang jor pakad sakati he
 However, a senior leader who closely observes Modi's style of work says, "modi never believes in changing leadership or shuffling the team more
" isliye gujarat main patidaar andolan ke baad bigade halaat se mukhyamantri anandiben patel ko hataane kii charchaa ho yaa phir khatter ko lekar lag rahi atakalon main zyada dam nahin dikhataa
 "they also argue that either Khattar or Anandiben have become the Chief Minister of Modi's liking
 Socio-political equations were not preferred while making both
" aise main unhen hataaya jaataa he to sidhe pradhanmantri modi par hi sawaal uthenge
 But other than these arguments, another BJP leader says, "did Modi ever face such situations in Gujarat?" Now they must understand the politics of Delhi, so many theories keep changing with experience
 aise main maamla shant hone ke kuch maheenon baad netritv parivartan ho jaae to koi achraj kii baat nahin hogi
 The question also started to arise on the committee, the power of these arguments is also visible because the BJP seems to be torn apart on the issue of this violent movement
 jaaton ko kendriya str par bhi aarakshan dene ke liye sansadeey kaarymantri venkaiya naidu ke netritv main bani bijepi kii paanch sadasyeey cameti ne jab 24 farvari ko teesri baithak kii to haryana ke sabhi saansadon ko bulaayaa gaya
 According to sources, in this meeting, Haryana BJP President Subhash Barala showed a clipping in which MP Rajkumar Saini was speaking while opposing Jat reservation
 is cliping ke baad gaiyr-jat saansad lamaband ho gaye or baithak main hi do guton ke bich jabardast tu-tu, main-main hone lagi
 From Congress to BJP and now in the Modi government, Rao Inderjit Singh, the minister, raised questions on the committee itself
 sutron ke mutabik, unhone kaha ki is cameti main ek bhi obisi kaa pratinidhi nahin he, aise main jaaton ko obisi cote se aarakshan dene par kaise vichaar ho saktaa he
 Issues such as loss of 34 thousand crore rupees, arson, rape, entering the hostels of female students also came up in the meeting
 sutron ke mutabik, ek saansad ne to yahaan tak kah diya ki haryana main bijepi kii sarkaar gaiyr-jaaton ne banaai he, lekin is tarah se jaaton ko tarjeeh di gai to gaiyr-jaaton ko raajnneeti chhodmai padegi
 MP Saini has said in his tone that he has talked about his OBC fraternity and he will keep saying this even further
 gaiyr-jaaton kii maang he ki jaaton ko obisi ke 27 fisadi main chhedchhad kiye bina aarakshan diya jaae
 The faction of non-jat leaders is adamant that those killed by police firing should not be compensated
 duusari taraf chandigarh main siyaasi paara bhi ufaan par he
 In order to make up for the damage caused by the violence and to compensate the dead, Anil Vij, a minister of the Khattar government, had opened a direct front
 sutron ke mutabik, gaiyr-jat vidhayak vij kii bebaaki se khush hai or ek khemaa jald hi vidhayak dal kii baithak bulaane kii maang kar rahaa he
 Through this meeting, angry legislators want to raise the voice of leadership change
 bijepi ke liye yah sthiti behad mushkil paidaa kar sakati he kyonki bijepi ke 47 vidhayakon main 41 gaiyr-jat hai or sirf 6 vidhayak hi jat samudaay se hai, jinamein do mantri hai
 The reality of caste-sharing could also be seen in the lukewarm response of the Haryana Police to the rioters who were looting and setting fire to everything they encountered along the way
 aisi kai reportein hai ki jat andolankariyon ko pehle se pataa tha ki police unke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin karegi, isliye unhone bade itminan se rasta roka or yahaan tak ki rajmargon ke sampark margon par excewetor se gahare gadde khod daale
 The army, which came under orders to shoot at Rohtak, Jhajjar and Bhiwani, had to actually show the rioters with a placard in their hands as they were already used to the soft policemen
 phir sankatmochan bane rajnathsansad ke baahar modi sarkaar ko ab tak jin badi chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa usamen jat aarakshan or jeenyu kaa masalaa ahm rahaa
 When the agitation turned violent, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Home Minister Rajnath Singh and asked him to handle the situation
 lalitget prakaran main vasundhara raaje, sushamaa swaraj kaa bachaav or vyapam main shivaraj singh chouhan or award vaapasi masale par kaman sanbhaalane vaale rajnath ko ek baar phir sankatmochan ke taur par sarkaar kii ore se aage aana padaa
 a senior party leader believes that Rajnath Singh is the only leader wearing a dhoti from a rural background in the kind of aristocratic domination that the bjp's top leadership has, which is the party's focus on issues of farmers as well as many important issues
 Have been keeping from uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri rahete hi rajnath kii chhavi kisaan samarthak hone kii vajah se unka is varg main asar bhi mana jaataa he
 On the morning of 20 February, Modi asked Rajnath to handle the entire matter
 uske baad jat netaa or kendriya rajyamantri sanjeev baalion ko madhyasth banaaya gaya
 He first held a meeting with the Khap Chaudharys of UP and the Reservation Conflict Committee
 agle din in jat netaaon ko maan-manouvval ke liye haryana bheja gaya
 Then the Jat leaders of Haryana came to Delhi and met Rajnath
 rajnath ne bharosa dilaayaa, ''bijepi aarakshan ke paksh main he, lekin sanvaidhanik-kanoonee rasta kya ho, us par vichaar ho rahaa he
 "on the other hand, Khattar called an all-party meeting and announced the bill and Shah formed a committee
 modi-shah ko sabakandolan kaa parinaam chaahe kuch bhi ho, jatigat aarakshan andolanon kii shrunkhlaa modi sarkaar ko ek sabak jarur de rahi he ki rajyon main kaddavar netritv kii gaiyr-maujuudagi or rajya se lekar centre tak saamaajik samikarnon kaa santulan or rajnatik kad ko darkinar karke satta ke sameekaran kaa samaadhaan sahaj nahin hoga
 "modi-shah will have to assess whether some members of the congregation, who indulge in personal self-interest, have strengthened their position in the government and the party, but where has the position of the government and the party reached," says a BJP leader
 ''jat aarakshan ke masale par jis tarah se haryana kii bijepi sarkaar kii vifaltaa saamne ai he, usase yah ummid kii jaani chahie ki modi ko ab dilli kii raajnneeti samaj aa rahi hogi
 Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat himself has started a new debate on reservation during Bihar elections and now when the BJP president set up a political committee on the Jat reservation issue, Bhagwat again reiterated his old stand
 unhone aarakshan kii samiksha ke liye gaiyr-rajnatik cameti gathit karne kii salaah di
 a BJP leader says, "whatever the political loss and damage may have been caused by the Sangh chief's reservation statement during the Bihar elections, but in the changed scenario after the violent Jat agitation, Bhagwat's statement that pressure groups for reservation It is made and politics happens, it seems absolutely right
 ''centre ke dakhal or uske baad jaaton ke liye aarakshan par ek kanoon banane kii ghoshnaa ke baad gussaye jat kuch samay ke liye thande pad gaye hai
 The BJP and its chief minister, however, have removed the lid on Pandora's box
 iskaa kya nateeja hoga, yah bataanaa naammumkin he
 But this movement has changed the basic sense of reservation
 aarakshan kaa jo mul bhav dow
 Bhimrao Ambedkar had given a representation of that section of the society which is really poor
 us varg ko atirikt sangrakshan kii darkaar bataai gai he
 But in the first 40 years after independence, in the era of undeclared casteism and then casteism declared after Mandal, parties and leaders of castes have become leaders
 aaj aarakshan kaa aadhaar saamaajik nirbalata nahin, balki yah ho gaya he ki maang karne vaala samaaj rajnatik drushti or baahubal ke pradarshan main kitna sakasham he
 The purpose of reservation was to strengthen the scared and scared people in the society, but in today's era, the political classes want to take reservation
 aise main modi-shah kii jodi ko yah samajhnaa hoga ki jis bijepi ne loksabhaa chunaav main apaar bahumat hasil kiya, aaj vah khud ko kahaan khadaa paa rahi he
 If the new pair of BJP can improve its style now, then it can surely create history, but this situation is not rectified under the long-term strategy, then there can be history entangled in the complexities of reservation

 Tiger Shroff, who looks strong or tough on screen, is known for being shy but when it comes to filming a romantic scene in the film Baghi, Tiger is neither shy nor hesitant

 Whatever the reason, the question is that it is permissible to use such words for those who work to clean the society's filth? Parents say that while the government should make the admission easy, but the Haryana government is feeling inferior by asking such questions but if it is compulsion to teach the children, then they will have to answer

 It was necessary that this supply of money to them be cut off, so we took such a big decision of demonetisation
 ' pradhanmantri ne kaha, 'keval 500 or 1000 kii note kii keemat hi 14 lakh karod he
 Our enemies, corrupt and anti-social elements use it

 Ajit Pawar's loss to the BJP had revolted against Sharad Pawar, with BJP in Maharashtra in a very dramatic manner on Saturday, Devendra Fadnavis took oath as Chief Minister
 sabase hairaan kar dene vaali baat yah rahi ki ajit pavaar ne upmukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee
 After the oaths of Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar, the country's big political pundits were surprised
 vahiin shivasena, congress or ensipi ke netaaon ko puraa seen samajhane main thodi der to lagi, lekin jab wo saamne aae to kaaphi atekking mod main rahe
 On the very next day of the oath, on Sunday itself, the three parties filed the petition and after hearing all the parties, the court on Wednesday asked Fadnavis to prove his majority
 bijepi netaa bhale hi 145 vidhayakon kaa saath hone kaa daawa karte rahe lekin inhen daavon ke bich mangalvaar dopaher 2
 At 35, Ajit Pawar resigned as deputy CM
 ajit pavaar ke istife ke saath ye bhi saaf ho gaya ki fadanvis sarkaar ab der zyada der nahin tikne vaali or kuch der baad hi devendra fadanvis ne siem pad se istipha de diya
 If we look at this whole incident, more damage was done to Ajit Pawar
 darasal, ajit pavaar ke paas ab naa to dipti siem kaa pad rahaa or naa hi shivasena, congress or ensipi gathbandhan kii banane vaali sarkaar main unako yah pad milane kii ummid he
 Ajit Pawar rebelled against uncle Sharad Pawar, went against his uncle Sharad Pawar's wish and joined hands with Devendra Fadnavis
 shuukravaar der shaam tak shivasena or congress ke saath sarkaar banane ke liye baithak karne vaale ajit pavaar ne shanivaar subah devendra fadanvis ke saath milakar sarkaar bana lee thi
 However, he did not support the NCP mlas whom he had rebelled against Sharad Pawar
 encipike baagi vidhayak party pramukh kii ek aawaaj par dobaaraa se unke paas laut aae
 After this Ajit Pawar fell alone
 is bich ensipi netaaon kii ore se bhi unhen manaane kii koshishen jari rahi or koshish us vakt rang laai jab unhone dipti siem pad se istipha diya or dobaaraa sharad pavaar ke paas lautnaa padaa
 Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress are poised to form government together
 pehle jahaan congress, shivasena or ensipi kii sarkaar main unhen dipti siem pad milane kii ummid thi, ab wo bhi khatm hoti najar aa rahi he
 Till Friday evening, there was a discussion that Ajit Pawar would become deputy CM in the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress governments, but due to the rebellion he hardly got any posts in the joint government of these three parties
 bade pavaar pade baariis puri ladaai se yah bhi saaf ho gaya ki ajit pavaar ko apane chachaa sharad pavaar se abhi bahut kuch seekhney kii jarurat he
 Ajit Pawar's stature has come down not only in the family but also in the party due to his decision to go with the BJP
 sharad pavaar se baghawat karne ke baad supriya sule ne kaha ki parivaar ne hameshaa bhai ajit pavaar kaa saath diya lekin unhone baghawat kar di
 Politics player Sharad Pawar had prepared his nephew Ajit Pawar as his political successor
 lekin pichley kuch samay se sharad pavaar ne beti supriya sule ko aage badhanaa shuru kar diya
 Sharad Pawar had given Ajit Pawar the responsibility of Maharashtra politics and daughter Supriya Sule to do politics in Delhi
 lekin ab ho saktaa he ajit pavaar se maharashtra kii jimmedaari bhi chhil lee jaae
 Sharad Pawar is angry with Ajit Pawar to the extent that on Monday he even said that he will take action against him and he (ajit Pawar) will not be able to take any decision
 sharad pavaar ne ajit pavaar ke khilaaf pehali karrwai shanivaar ko hi kar di thi, jab unhone ajit pavaar se vidhayak dal ke netaa kaa pad chhin liya tha
 What happened in the country, the world, the metropolis, sports, economic and Bollywood
 jaanane ke liye yahaan padhein samay ke saath saath khabaron kaa live apadation

 i also want to make a small humble contribution in this era of internet rants on politics
 agar chetan bhagat aaj maharashtra main bijepi ke ubhaar par kitaab likhte to uskaa kya naam rakhte? jaahir he, 'do half garlfrends
 'since he loves counting so much in his titles, it would have been even better if he had named the book,' 123 and two half-girlfriends
 'mujhe nahin pataa, isamen internet bazaar ko lubhaane kaa kitna madda he, lekin desh ke duusare sabase bade rajya main bijepi ke laajawab gaiyr-asamanjas ko bayaan karne kaa yah nishchit taur par behatar tarika he
 Interestingly, it also reveals the condition of the defeated and rejected Congress party
 yah kaise he or ham ise bijepi kaa gaiyr-asamanjas kyon kehete hai
 The 2014 elections have proved so much that as far as political theater is concerned, only one show is successful on this and that is BJP
 yah kai logon ke paala badalane se pehle hi jaahir ho chukaa tha
 But now Sharad Pawar and his NCP mob has changed unconditionally, which has not happened before in our politics
 chunki internet or google se pehle bhi hamaara rajnatik itihaas tha or chunki haryana main bhi abhi chunaav hue hai, isliye bhajanlaal ke aitihaasik dalbadal se isaki tulana karne kaa lobh hota hi he
 With Indira Gandhi's return to power in the summer of 1980, Bhajan Lal left the Janata Party along with all its mlas and joined the Congress in a mass defection
 is tarah ek janata mukhyamantri or uskaa mantrimandal raturaat congressi ban gaye the
 Pawar's frolic does not seem as grand and luxurious, but he has left Bhajanlal behind in terms of pure thick skin shamelessness
 bhajanlaal ke haath main kam-se-kam saudebaaji ke phaayde to the
 Pawar is knocking at the bjp's door with a begging bowl in his hand
 isse hamaari do garlfrends main se ek kii haalat kaa bakhubi pataa chalata he
 The other's condition is even more pathetic because unlike Pawar (whose politics has always been 'resilient' — remember Pranab Mukherjee once described how cleverly Pawar was, by saying that Pawar always gave mixed signals
 Was), Shiv Sena politics, and i would say the economy too, has been based on Giddarbhki, Dabangai and thunderous rhetoric
 is chunaav nattejey ne uske gubaare main chhed kar diya he
 In the only state where she has importance, she has finally shrunk to becoming bjp's B-team
 uskaa prabhaav itnaa kamjor ho gaya he ki jitna satta ke kareeb na hone ke baavjood bala sahib ke jamaane main kabhi nahin hua tha
 If she stays away from the BJP, she will also lose the supremacy of the Greater Mumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) which is the financial fuel of her politics
 aam taur par kaha jaataa he ki taaja chunaav parinaamon kii sabase ahm baat he narendra modi-amit shah jodi kii donon rajyon main akele chunaav ladane kii gustaakhee
 But this is a little more cryptic
 yah bijepi ke focus, uske netritv kii ranneetik duuradrushti or apane kaaryakartaaon ke liye patibaddhta kii kahani he
 She was a marginal player in Maharashtra and then Pramod Mahajan's murder was also a shock to her
 to bhi vah apane raste se digi nahin
 If you study the results of elections one by one carefully, you can see bjp's vote percentage and seats increasing continuously
 2009 ke vidhansabha chunaavon se bhi isi rujhaan kii tasdik hui
 She held the corner of the Shiv Sena's kurta and hung it for as long as she needed and is now taunting her by pretending to deny her right
 is patan ke liye keval uddhav thakare ko doshi tehraane kii ichha swaabhaavik he
 But the strategic Mahabhul himself, who exposed Shiv Sena back and forth, was done by Bala Saheb himself, when he changed the base of the party standing on the land of Maharashtravad and put it on the ground of Hinduism
 shivasena mul rup se mumbai kii trade unionon par vamapanthiyon kii pakad kaa muqabla karte hue aage badi or us vakt congress ne bhi saajha shatru ke khilaaf uskaa khushi-khushi khub istemaal kiya
 There were also reports that the Army had 'worked closely' with the Congress in occasional elections
 jab tak vah marathi maanus ke haq main bolti, dabangai karti or utpaat machaati thi, tab tak uski jagah kaayam thi
 But the day Balasaheb joined Hindutva, possibly inspired by the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992, the Shiv Sena became an ally of the BJP
 yah us vakt tak to kargar rahaa jab tak lagaam vaajapeyi-adwani kii shaleen peedi ke haathon main thi
 He maintained a benevolent, secular, inclusive façade and the Shiv Sena on his right could capture headlines with his antics
 lekin modi ke ubhaar ne vah sab badal diya
 He was the real, repentant spokesman of Hindutva and the Shiv Sena could not fight him in any state in the state
 maharashtrawaad kii ore lautne ke liye ab bahut der ho chuki thi
 Uddhav confessed in front of his senior partymen that it was a mega event but he had three problems with him
 ek, unka kad itnaa ooncha nahin tha ki ve bala sahib dwaara sthapit rukh ko palat pate
 Two, his cousin Raj had already moved to Manus
 or teen, unhone ise bahut der se choda, unke saamne vikalp yahi tha ki yaa to ve bich safar main ranneetik sudhaar karte yaa bijepi se naata todakar ekala chalo re chunate
 Meanwhile, the BJP continued to infiltrate and encroach on their territory
 modi ab aaraam se baithkar alpamat sarkaar bana sakate hai or shivasena ko chunauti de sakate hai ki vah congress ke saath vot dekar sarkaar ko giraakar dikhaae
 First, the NCP, for whom it is a question of life and death, will not allow this to happen
 or agar hone bhi detii he to nae chunaav main shivasena kaa bachaa-khuchaa bhi nasht ho jayega
 Now you must have understood why BJP can play as a toy with both of them as a half-girlfriend
 haryana main bilkul bhinn ranneeti apanaai gai
 Kuldeep Bishnoi had no allegiance with the party and the Lok Sabha elections had revealed how important he was
 bijepi kaa dussahas yah tha ki usne chautaala or unke saath pakki jeet ko bhi inkaar kar diya
 He decided to go ahead with his luck and courage and that too in a state where he himself had never won more than 13 out of 90 seats on his election symbol (as Jana Sangh, in 1967)
 jhagadaalu vanshavaadi raajnneeti se oobe matadaataaon ke saamne bijepi ekmaatr nayaa vikalp thi
 It should be assumed that inspired by this success, now she will distance herself from the last political partner Akali Dal
 or kyon nahin, aakhir akali dal bhi ek vanshavaadi udhyam he jisase matadaata ajiz aa chuke hai
 Compare this with the performance of the Congress in those states whose control was either with allies or directly in its hands
 tamilnadu main dashakon se ek dravid sahyogi ke saath uskaa saz rahaa he
 But she failed to establish her presence, cadre and credibility in the state so much that in 2014 when she did not get support of any party, she lost the entire 39 seats
 uske rajya sanghathan kaa na vajood he, na netaa
 Tamil Nadu is an important example because Indira and Rajiv Gandhi have been receiving a lot of love and respect here for decades
 lekin unki party ne apni kahili or aramtlabi se yah rajya sthaneey sahyogi ke kadamon main daal diya
 This lack of confidence is evident from the fact that Rahul Gandhi made millions of members of the Youth Congress, in which 90 percent were separated
 isaki tulana bijepi kii uplabdhi se kiijie jo usne isse milti-julati paristhiti main maharashtra main hasil kii he
 In Seemandhra (another major state where the Congress was wiped out in the May elections) and in West Bengal too, the party broke away from its leaders (vai, respectively)

 Jaganmohan Reddy and Mamta Banerjee) were seen seizing their political ground
 donon rajyon main ab pramukh rashtriya party ke taur par bijepi uski jagah le rahi he or kshatrapon ke saamne usne keval yahi vikalp choda ki usase laden yaa uskaa varchasv sweekaar kar len
 Chandrababu Naidu is a BJP partner and it would be better to keep an eye on his back
 mamata itani chatur hai ki jaanati hai ki vam ke patan or congress kii gumshudagi ke saath bijepi unke rajya main nai ubhartee hui takat he
 This is the larger message of these state elections
 rashtriya taur par bijepi ab nai congress he
 And the Congress has not convinced us even a little bit now that it can be at least an old BJP

 PS: My first major political story was a cover story written for this magazine in January 1985 titled 'the Opposition: In the Wilderness' (indiatoday
 in / 1985opposition)
 It was written after the Rajiv Gandhi wave
 unhone shekhi baghaarte hue kaha tha ki unhone teen pramukh vipakshi dalon ke liye ek 10+2+3 pranali kaa elaan kiya he
 The lowest 2 were for BJP
 lekin bijepi haar maanane ko taiyaar nahin thi
 Although i did not have much experience, both Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani gave me time to meet
 thik yahi chandrashekhar or ramakrishna hegade ne bhi kiya
 In comparison, look at today's Congress which has outsourced its rescue responsibility to the mighty Mani Shankar Aiyar
 lekin bijepi netaaon kaa jawaab sabase mahatvapurn or bhavishyadarshi tha
 As expected, Advani was determined
 unhone kaha ki unki party ko zyada spasht vaicharik aadhaar kii ore lautnaa hoga or gathbandhan kii maansikta se ubarna hoga, kyonki yah maansikta unki raajnneeti ko mahaj gandhi parivaar ke virodh tak simit kar detii he
 Vajpayee was more sad but in a philosophical posture and was looking forward
 unhone mujhase kaha, ''sitaron se aage jahaan or bhi hai” or sweekaar kiya ki ekmaatr indira-virodh-vaad ke naare par nirbhar rahakar vipaksh ne galati kii
 He had said, "when Indira ji was not there, we had nothing to say against Rajiv
" ” lekin puraane panne palatate hue unke ek or bayaan par meri nigaah atak gai
 He said that the entire politics will have to be more youthful now
 unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki unki party ke paas ''bombai main pramod mahajan or dilli main arun jetali” jaise honhaar yuva netaa hai
 Remember, this was in January 1985 and the age of these two leaders was only slightly above 30 years at that time
 bijepi main modi or shah ne karine se vaajapeyi or adwani kii jagah le lee he
 The question for the Congress is: Who are your Advani, Vajpayee and then Mahajan and Jaitley? Or do you have any plan for sportsmen and sports too? Modi can now sit down and form a minority government and challenge the Shiv Sena to show the government by collapsing with the Congress
 awwal to ensipi aisa hone nahin degi
 Even if this happens, the remaining land of Shiv Sena will also be lost in the next elections
 bhartiya janata party ke varisht netaa murali manohar joshi kaa laalkrishna adwani ke naam ek patr soshal media par viral ho rahaa he, jisamen aise aarope lagaae gaye hai ki bijepi ne un donon masalan murali manohar joshi or laalkrishna adwani ko chup kara diya or unhen apamaanit kar party se baahar nikaal diya
 But this letter viral on social media is completely fake and Murali Manohar Joshi himself has written a complaint to the Chief Election Commissioner
 murali manohar joshi ne mukhya chunaav ayukta sunil aroda ko ek patr likhaa he
 In this letter, he has demanded a letter inquiry
 mukhya chunaav ayukta ko likhe chitthee main murali manohar joshi ne likhaa he ki - mere ek mitra ne mujhe phone par bataaya he ki soshal media par ek patr viral ho rahaa he, jisamen aisa chal rahaa he ki maine laalkrishna adwani ke naam yah chitthee likhi he
 He further said that i have not written any such letter to Advani ji and please check where the letter came from which went viral on social media

 com / 4oe3rbmkjqxaraasala, shanivaar-ravivaar ko soshal media par logon ne murali manohar joshi kaa patr samaj kar unke phek patr ko share kiya
 Murali Manohar Joshi is angry with the party for not giving tickets to the BJP from Kanpur in the Lok Sabha elections
 yahi vajah he ki logon ne bhi is phek patr par vishwaas kar liya
 Another reason to believe was that the scribe had put the logo of the news agency NI on it
 haalanki, baad main eenai ne bhi ise farji bataaya tha
 Last time when the BJP did not give the ticket, after the party's decision, Murali Manohar Joshi wrote a letter to his voters in Kanpur and said that Ramlal is asking him not to contest
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki bijepi ne umr kaa hawala dekar laalkrishna adwani or murali manohar joshi samet kai bujurg netaaon ke tikat kaate hai
 Please tell that this time the party has given Amit Shah a ticket from Gandhinagar in place of LK Advani
 yah seat 1991 se laalkrishna adwani ke naam rahi thi
 It is worth noting that a few days ago, in view of the Lok Sabha elections 2019, the BJP had released a list of 40 star campaigners for Uttar Pradesh
 is list main piem modi samet kai diggaj netaaon ke naam hai, magar laalkrishna adwani or murali manohar joshi kaa naam nahin tha
 The BJP MP from Banswara Dungarpur in Rajasthan sees incarnations of God in Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and Sakshat Devi in prime Minister Narendra Modi

 He also said that Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje is the incarnation of Devi
 bacchon kii bhalaai ke liye vah sara kaam kar rahe hai
 If a child is still a victim of malnutrition, then there is nothing he can do
 maanshankar ninama BJP se pehali baar bansawada duungarpur se saansad bane hai
 He was speaking at a program to feed children up to eighth grade at the State Secondary School in Ghatol town of Dungarpur district
 haalanki, rajasthan main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bhagwaan kaa avatar bataane or vasundhara raaje ko devi ke avatar banane kaa yah pehla maamla nahin he
 Earlier, Home Minister Gulabchand Kataria called Prime Minister Narendra Modi an avatar of God on earth
 yahi nahin unhone vasundhara raaje ko devi bataate hue jodhpur main ek mandir banane kii shuruyaat bhi kar di thi

 1989 main jab soviet ne afghanistan chhod diya, baad main america ne chhod diya lekin ye aatanki sanghathan pakistan main hi rahe

 Congress bid- The reason for the economic crisis in the country is demonetisation and GST Manish Tiwari's stance - Is Jawahar Nehru responsible for the economic crisis? The Congress Party has undergone a tremendous siege of the Modi government over NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar's statement on the economy
 congress netaa manish tiwari ne kaha ki niti ayog ke vaais chairman ne bharat kii arthvyavastha ko lekar jo khulaasa kiya he, uske liye unako mubaarakabaad deni chahie
 He has spoken the truth about the state of economy in the Modi government
 congress netaa ne bijepi or modi sarkaar par tanj kasate hue kaha ki jo aaj desh kii aarthik sthiti or paristhiti he, waisi pichley 70 saal main kabhi nahin dekhne ko mili
 Now the people of Bharatiya Janata Party would like to blame Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru for this economic situation
 haalanki hakeekat yah he ki ye halaat na to pandit jawahar laal nehru ke kaaran hai or na hi congress party ke kaaran hai
 This situation has been created by the Modi government itself in the last five years
 manish tiwari ne kaha ki notebandi or jiesti kii vajah se desh kii aarthik sthiti kharaab hui he
 The cost of demonetisation and GST is still suffering from this country
 modi sarkaar ke notebandi or jiesti ke faisle ne desh kii arthvyavastha kii dhajjiyaan uda di
 There is no industry today that is not grappling with economic crisis
 phir chaahe taxtile industry ho, automobile industry ho yaa innervier industry yaa phir biscuit banane vaali company ho
 He said that the sword of unemployment is hanging above three crore people
 shuukravaar ko biscuit banane vaali parle-ji ne 10 hajaar logon ko naukari se nikaal diya
 This whole story does not end with employment alone
 congress netaa ne kaha ki jab bijepi vipaksh main thi, tab rupee ke kamjor hone par hangaamaa karti thi
 However, the situation today is that the rupee is the weakest currency in Asia
 congress netaa manish tiwari ne kaha ki desh kii aarthik haalat itani badtar ho chuki he, lekin pradhanmantri, vittamantri or vanijya mantri ko yah bhi nahin pataa he ki in paristhitiyon se kaise nipta jaae? inaki taraf se is mudde par ek bhi bayaan tak nahin aayaa he
 He said that today the Modi government has imposed undisclosed emergency in the entire country
 iskaa makasad desh main gahraate aarthik sankat se logon kaa dhyaan bhatkaana he
 Apart from this, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has also attacked the Modi government regarding the condition of the economy
 unhone kaha ki bijepi sarkaar ko ab desh ko saaf-saaf bataanaa chahie ki arthvyavastha kii durdasha aisi kyon ho rahi he? vyapaar tut rahaa he, udyog dagamagaa rahe hai, rupaya kamjor hota ja rahaa he, naukariyaan khatm ho rahi hai
 Who will compensate the loss due to this? Let us tell you that on Friday, Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, advised the government to take private companies into confidence
 unhone kaha tha ki aaj desh kii puri vittiya pranali jokhim main he
 No one has faced such a situation in the last 70 years
 rajeev kumaar kaa kahana he ki notebandi or jiesti ke baad yah cash sankat badha he
 Today no one is trusting anyone
 privet sector ke bheetar koi bhi karj dene ko taiyaar nahin he, har koi nagdi dabaakar baitha he
 Along with this, Rajiv Kumar advised the government to take some steps out of the box
 internet par kuch bhi search karne ke liye aap google kaa sahaara lete hai, lekin kai baar jo aap dhundhna chaahate hai, wo dhund nahin pate hai
 When you want to find out about a particular time or someone's talk or a person, you have to use some tricks

 agar pramotion mila he to aise karen kaam or bane parfect senior3
 (~ Tilde): If you write a word after writing a tilde and write synonyms, then only you will get it
 jaise: Christmas~desserts
 If you write Christmas desserts together, you will get half the incomplete information about both
 lekin aap Christmas~desserts lagaate hai to aap sirf desserts se hi sambandhit cheez hasil karenge
 4
 (site:):agar aap koi spacific site hi paanaa chaahate hai to website kaa naam daalkar uske aage site: likhen

 taarikh 30 janvari 1948
 Day friday is din kii subah to janvari kii aam subah jaisi hi thi
 But by evening, this day brought illusion to the whole country
 isi taarikh ko mahatma gandhi kii hatya hui thi
 Three bullets of the killer Nathu Ram Godse had ended the life of Mahatma Gandhi on this day
 mahatma gandhi ke nijee sachiv ve kalyanm is din bhi baapu ke saath the
 He has written all that has happened from the time he woke up to Gandhiji at half past three in the wee hours of 30 January to half an hour after his assassination
 is din ke bare main ve kalyanm ne jo likhaa he use padhate hue aap us din ko jeene lagate hai
 Everyone should read this article because it is important to see and understand the mistakes made in their past
 to aaie jaldi se yah jaan lete hai ki apane jivan ke aakhri din mahatma gandhi ne koun-koun si baaten kahi or kis-kis se kahi
 On this day too, Bapu woke up at three thirty in the morning as usual
 hameshaa kii hi tarah unhone subah kii prarthana kii
 After this daily activities started
 un dinon dilli main halaat saamaanya se koson dur the
 There were riots everywhere, Mahatma Gandhi was very sad because of this
 us din gandhiji se jo mashhoor hastiyaan milane ain unamem shrimati aarake nehru bhi thim
 She came at six in the morning and was to go to America in the afternoon
 unke anurodh par gandhiji ne unhen apane dastakhat ke saath ek photo diya jis par likhaa tha, ‘aap ek garib desh kii pratinidhi hai or is naate aap vahaan sada or mitavyayi tareeke se rahen
 At around two o'clock, Gandhiji was interviewed by Life magazine's famous photographer Margaret Burke
 is dauraan unhone poocha, ‘aap hameshaa kehete rahe hai ki main 125 saal tak jeena chaahunga
 How do you expect this? ”gandhiji's answer was astonishing
 unhone kaha ki ab unki aisi koi ummid nahin he
 When Margaret asked the reason for this, she said, 'because so many terrible things are happening in the world
 main andhere main nahin rahanaa chahta
 After Margaret left Professor NR Malkani accompanied two men
 pakistan main hamaare dipti hai kamishnar malkani ne gandhiji ko sindh ke hinduon kii durdasha bataai
 After listening to him with patience, Gandhiji said, 'if people had listened to me, it would not have happened
 meraa kaha log maanate nahin
 Still i keep saying what i think is true
 mujhe pataa he ki log mujhe puraane jamaane kaa aadmi samajhane lage hai
 'his own watchman was also posted at the gate of Birla Bhavan
 beete saal gandhiji kii sabhaaon ke dauraan quran kii aayaton ke paath par aapattiyaan jataai gai thim or isliye sardaar patel ne grahamantri ke taur par ehtiyaati upaay baratate hue birla bhawan main ek head consteble or chaar constablon kii niyukti kaa aadesh diya tha
 There was a bomb blast at a prayer meeting on 20 January
 yah bam madan laal naam ke ek punjabi sharnaarthi ne phenkaa tha
 But Gandhiji did not realize it
 isse ek diwaar tut gai thi
 But Gandhiji never felt that someone had come to kill him
 phir bhi police ko lagata tha ki mahatma kii jaan ko khatra he so birla bhawan main tainaat police bal kii sankhya badha di gai thi
 However, the police wanted to strengthen the security system and for this purpose wanted to search every person who attended the prayer meeting
 lekin mahatma gandhi ne is bare main saaf-saaf manaa kar diya tha
 But the police DIG was not satisfied with this and in the afternoon he himself came to Birla Bhavan
 diaiji ne mahatma gandhi se kaha ki unki jaan ko khatra he so police ko apana kaam karne dena chahie
 In response to this, Bapu said, 'those who give priority to safety instead of freedom have no right to live
 ’ logon kii talaashi ke liye sahamat hone kii bajaay ve prarthana sabha roak denge
 At five o'clock in the evening, Mahatma Gandhi was to go to the lawn outside for his prayers
 lekin usase pehle kareeb chaar baje desh ke grih mantri sardaar patel apni beti ke saath vahaan pahunche
 Patel was called by Gandhi because he wanted to talk to him
 jab patel birla bhawan pahunche to baapu bhojan kar rahe the
 Bapu and Patel started talking on food
 paanch bajane ke baad bhi yah baatcheet chalati rahi
 Given the importance and seriousness of the talk, none of us dared to speak in between
 abha or manu ne sardaar patel kii beti maniben ko ishaara kiya or paanch bajkar das minute par baatcheet khatm ho gai
 After this, Gandhiji went to the toilet and immediately proceeded to the place of prayer which would have been about 30-40 yards
 prarthana sabha tak jate hue gandhi abha or manu ko daant rahe the
 They were angry because they were not late for prayer, why they were not told
 unka kahana tha, ‘mujhe der ho gai he
 i do not like it
 ’ jab manu ne kaha ki itani gambhir baatcheet ko dekhte hue vah isamen baadha nahin daalana chaahati thi to gandhiji ne jawaab diya, ‘nurse kaa kartavya he ki vah marij ko sahi vakt par dawaai de
 If it is late, then the patient can die
 ’bheed main apnehatyare nathuramki maujuudagi se bekhbar mahatma gandhi abha or manu se ye bate karte hue aage bad rahe the tabhi ek ke baad ek teen goliyaan chalin or mahatma ke kadam ruk gaye
 His glasses and patches were scattered somewhere away from him
 chaaro taraf afra-tafari much gai
 In the afternoon, Mahatma Gandhi told Life magazine's famous photographer Margaret Burke that he does not want to live anymore because the world has become very bad and he does not want to live in this darkness

 aise main ab shaayad katrina ko lagane laga he ki vah kuch alag karen or shaayad yahi vajah he ki vah apane se junior abhinaytaon ke saath filmein kar rahi hai
 Anyway, when Katrina did the film 'mere Brother Ki Dulhan' with her junior Emraan Khan, the film was quite popular and it was said that Katrina can also carry the burden of the film on her shoulders
 ek baar phir yah chunauti katrina ke kandhon par aa jaaegi, jab aditya roy kapur or siddharth ke saath unki film relies hogi
 However, the time has come for Katrina, when not only should she show her stardom, but also experiment with characters at the box office

 If Katrina now works with juniors, she will get important roles and credit for success

 Differences between Team Anna and Ramdev continue and RTI activist Arvind Kejriwal refutes the yoga guru's claim that the protocol for not naming politicians or making personal attacks on anyone was fixed during the speech at the fast
 kejariwal ravivaar ko achaanak manch se uthakar chale gaye the or ramdev ne daawa kiya tha ki baithak ke liye protocol tay kiya gaya tha or yah faisla hua tha ki kisi kaa naam nahin liya jayega kyonki isse kaala dhan waapas laane or bhrashtachar ke muddon se dhyaan hatega
 However, Kejriwal said, "there was no such protocol that we cannot name anyone
" jab maine bhaashan ke dauraan naam liye, to mujhe ek chit mili jisamen likhaa tha ki main kisi kaa naam nahin le saktaa
 i was not told that names could not be taken

 ’kejariwal ne kaha, ‘ramdev sant hai
 He thinks philosophically that we should not take names and we should only talk about issues
 vah bhi sahi hai or main bhi sahi hum
 His claim came at a time when the sudden exit of Kejriwal caused cracks in the newly formed ramdev-anna Hazare alliance
 ravivaar raat ramdev ne bayaan jari kar kaha tha, ‘ham garima ke saath andolan chalaanaa chaahate hai
 We do not want to take names and divert attention from issues

 This is the reason why despite the offer of stake in the Maharashtra government, the Congress is stuck
 bataa den ki maharashtra main pehle bijepi or baad main shivasena tay samay main sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh nahin kar sake
 The marathon meeting of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress in Maharashtra on Monday could not yield any result
 maharashtra main sarkaar banane ko lekar sankat barkaraar he
 While Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray himself called and sought support from Sonia Gandhi to form the government, Congress leader KC Venugopal called it merely a 'courtesy talk'
 vahiin, congress kaa maananaa he ki maharashtra sarkaar main deree unki taraf se nahin, balki ensipi chif sharad pavaar kii ore se ho rahi he
 The Congress theory behind this is that Sharad Pawar wants both parties Shiv Sena and NCP to get CM posts for two and a half years
 yani siem kaa pad roteshnal ho
 At the same time, Shiv Sena still wants to make Aditya Thackeray the chief minister
 alpsankhyak vot khisakane kaa khatracongress shivasena ke saath khulkar saamne nahin aa rahi he
 She is speaking through NCP instead of Shiv Sena
 maharashtra main gathbandhan kii jimmedaari congress ne sharad pavaar ke kandhon par daal di he
 In fact, Congress politics is worried that the minority vote should not get upset when the Shiv Sena goes along, because the Shiv Sena has been doing radical Hindutva politics since the beginning
 congress ke centre main dharmanirpekshata gathjod kaa uskaa sapana adhuraa rah jayega
 In this way, the Congress is fearing that joining hands of Shiv Sena can become a sore throat
 uttar bhartiya vot kaa khatracongress kii chintaa he ki maharashtra main shivasena ke saath haath milaane par kahin uttar bhartiya matadaat naaraaz na ho jaae
 Shiv Sena has been targeting North Indians in Maharashtra
 aise main shivasena ke saath sarkaar banane par uttar bhartiya rajyon main congress ko apane vot chhitakane kaa khatra he
 That is why the Congress is stuck in a mess
 bal thakare or sonia gandhi ke bich chhattis kaa aankadacongress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke videsh mul kaa mudda banane main shivasena sansthaapak bal thakare kii ahm bhoomika rahi he
 Not only this, Sonia Gandhi has been avoiding meeting Shiv Sena leaders since 1999
 purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne apni pustak 'da koelishan ears 1996 tu 2012 main likhaa he ki 2012 main raashtrapati chunaav ke dauraan unhone bal thakare se mulaakaat karne parcongress adhyaksh sonia gandhi naarazho gai thim
 In such a situation, how Sonia Gandhi joined hands with Shiv Sena remains confused
 maharashtra ke diggaj congressi nahin chaahate gathbandhanmaharashtra ke kai diggaj congressi netaa shivasena ke saath gathbandhan karne par sahamat nahin he
 They feel that if the Congress helps in forming the government of NCP and Shiv Sena, then both the regional parties will become stronger in Maharashtra
 aise main congress kii sthiti uttar pradesh jaisi ho jaaegi
 The Congress supported the SP and the BSP in UP
 iskaa nateeja he ki abhi tak congress upi main vaapasi nahin kar saki he

 Another state-run telecom company BSNL has such a scheme already working for consumers
 philhal emtnael upabhoktaaon ko dilli or mumbai se baahar jane par aane vaali kol ke liye roming shulk adaa karnaa hota he
 The comments emtnael ke chairman evam prabandh nideshak en ke yadav ne samachar agency bhashaa se baatcheet main kaha ki yojana kii ghoshnaa jald hogi or isaki taarikh tay kii ja rahi he
 The government has set a target of gradually freeing roaming under the National Telecom Policy 2012
 doorsanchaar mantri ravishankar prasad ne sanchaar evam soochna praudyogiki mantralay se judi salaahkaar samiti kii baithak ke dauraan saansadon ko bataaya ki emtnael jaldi hi muft roming suvidha shuru karne kii yojana bana rahi he
 Earlier in the month of June, the public sector telecom company BSNL started its free roaming service, which relieved the company's customers from paying fees on incoming calls across the country
 beasenel ke chairman evam prabandh nideshak anupam shrivastav ne us vakt kaha tha ki ab beasenel ke graahakon ko roming ke dauraan kai handset va sim rakhane kii jarurat nahin hogi
 They will be able to talk for free on incoming calls

 isse pehle june ke maheene main saarvajanik kshetra kii doorsanchaar company beasenel ne apni muft roming seva shuru kii thi jisase deshbhar main company ke graahakon ko inakming colls par shulk dene se raahat mil gai thi
 BSNL Chairman and Managing Director Anupam Srivastava said at that time that now BSNL customers will not need to keep many handsets and sims while roaming
 inakming colls par ve muft main kitni bhi lambii baat kar sakenge

 01 pratishat se hi chunaav jeeta tha
 Kunwar Sarvesh Kumar 7 of Moradabad
 75 fisadi se hi chunaav jeet paye
 Anshul Verma of BJP from Hardoi Sahara to Shiv Prasad Verma of BSP 8
 36 fisadi yani 85913 maton se haraaya tha
 Even from Shravasti, bjp's Daddan Mishra was able to win by a margin of 85913 votes, even less when the sp's Bahubali Atiq Ahmad was standing against him, despite him only 8
 77 fisadi maton ke antar se hi haraa paae the
 bjp's Anju Bala 8 from Mishrikh Safer
 75 fisadi vot ke maton ke antar se hi jiti to kushinagar se rajesh pandeya 9 fisadi vot ke antar se hi chunaav jeet paye
 9 to Bhishma Shankar Tiwari of bjp's Sharad Tripathi BSP from Sant Kabir Nagar
 68 fisadi se to nagina surakshit se bijepi ke yashavanth singh 9
 He was able to beat his opponent by a margin of 80 percent votes
 in 16 siton ke alaava pradesh main khaastaur par purvanchal main 8 or aisi site hai jiname jeet kaa antar 10 pratishat se to adhik he lekin itnaa bada nahin jise pata na ja sake
 First is Kushinagar where bjp's Rajesh Pandey won from RPN Singh of Congress by a margin of 85,540 votes
 dumriyaganj se bijepi ke jagadambika paal he jo basapa ke mo
 Mukim was defeated by one lakh three votes
 khiri se bijepi ke jeet kaa antar ek lakh das hazaar kaa tha yahaan bijepi ke ajay kumaar basapa ke aravind giri ko haraaya tha
 After Kheri, in Daurahra also, in response to bjp's candidate Rekha's three lakh sixty thousand votes, Dawood Ahmed of BSP had got a strong fight with two lakh thirty four thousand votes
 banda main bijepi ke bhairav prasad mishra ke teen lakh bayalis hazaar vot ke jawaab main basapa ke aarake singh patel ne do lakh chhbbees hazaar vot paa kar kadaa muqabla kiya tha
 In Ballia, sp's Neeraj Shekhar had given a tough fight to Bharat Singh of BJP
 bharat singh ke teen lakh unsath hazaar vot ke jawaab main niraj shekhar ko do bees hazaar vot mili the
 The situation was the same in Jaunpur
 bijepi ke krishnapratap basapa ke subhash pandeya ko ek lakh chhiyalees hazaar maton ke antar se haraaya tha
 This difference is slightly more in Ghosi, Dara Singh of BSP lost from every Narayan Rajbhar of BJP by a margin of one lakh sixty six thousand votes
 in siton ke jeet ke antar ko thode se bhi vot swing se haraaya ja saktaa he
 These are the seats of Uttar Pradesh on which BJP will have to sweat because this time there is no Modi wave like 2014
 janata paanch saal ke shashan kaa jawaab bhi maang rahi he
 Unemployment, problems of farmers, and promises made in 2014 elections which have not been fulfilled, can upset BJP
 iske alaava sapa-basapa kaa gathbandhan or priyanka ke maidan main aane ke baad nae kalevar or josh main utari congress in siton par baari pad sakati he
 In such a situation, the BJP will have to increase its vote percentage to around 20 percent only then it will be able to retain its medicine in these seats

 Let us tell you that under this, states are required to have Aadhaar card for registration, marriage registration, LPG connection and government ration in school-college
 justise bi es chouhan or justise es e bobade kii bench ne kaha ki aadhaar card ke masale par nyaayik vyavastha dete samay rajya sarkaron ke drushtikon par vichaar karnaa jaruri he
 The bench sought to know from the states that what is the nature of the Aadhaar card scheme and whether the Aadhaar card has been linked to government facilities? The court was considering petitions challenging the constitutionality of the Aadhaar card
 in yachikaaon main kaha gaya he ki isse nagarikon ke vyaktigat adhikaron kaa hanan ho rahaa he
 The petitioners also include Puttaswamy, a retired High Court judge
 ye chaahate hai ki yojana ayog or bhartiya vishisht pahchaan praadhikaran ko 28 janvari, 2009 ke shaskeey aadesh ke jariye aadhaar card jari karne se roka jaae
 Senior advocate Shyam Dewan, appearing for one of the petitioners, argued that right to privacy is being violated by collecting personal information about people as there is a possibility of its misuse
 unhone kaha ki nagarikon se sambandhit vyaktigat suchanaaen nijee vyakti ikattha kar rahe hai, jisase nagarikon kii niztaa ko gambhir khatra ho saktaa he
 On this, the court said that it cannot be seen only from the aspect of privacy because there is more food and water in the country than the right to privacy
 court ne kaha ki is desh kaa kathor sach yah he ki zyaadaatar logon ke liye khaanaa or pani rhite tu privesi se zyada mahatvapurn he
 Will those who struggle for flour and rice talk about privacy? As far as the consent of the children is concerned, the marriage of children is done here at the will of the family
 court ne kaha, 'aap kis sahmati kii baat kar rahe hai? kya aapako pataa he ki bharat main 69 fisadi ladakiyon kii shaadi 18 saal se pehle hi kar di jaati he or 30 fisadi bacchon ko unki manjuuri ke bina bal majdoor bana diya jaataa he?'yachikakarta ke vakil shyaam dewan ne kaha ki kerala main bacchon se jabaran unki personal jaankaree maangi ja rahi he kyonki vahaan sarkari skulon main daakhile ke liye aadhaar card jaruri he
 To this, the court said, "for such children, more bread, rice and pulses are more important than sanctioning for Aadhaar card
 kya aapako pataa he ki inamen se zyaadaatar bachche sirf mid-de mile ke liye skool jate hai? shiksha kii gunvattta kisi he? padhaane se zyada teacher mid-de mile taiyaar karne main vyast rahete hai

 This is very serious because we have already reached the middle of dengue, chikungunya season
 jab khud alji is dengue, chikangunia ke mudde par sakriyata ke saath baithak karke kadam uthaa rahe hai to kya kaaran he ki DIP kii jaagrukta badhaane main koi dilchaspee nahi he?' sisodiya ne aage kaha he ki 'mujhe samaj nahin aata ki aise naakaabil afasar ko naa hataane ke peeche kya majaburiyaan hai?' Sisodia had written a letter to the Chief Secretary on the issue of Facebook Live, saying that it is shocking that in the present day, the Delhi Government official does not know about Facebook Live
 sisodiya ne kuch pehle se fasebuk live karne ke liye taiyaari karne ke liye kaha tha lekin DIP nideshak saarangi ne tender kii baat kahi

 fasebuk live ke mudde par mukhya sachiv ko sisodiya ne chitthee likhakar kaha tha ki ye hairaan karne vaala he ki aaj ke jamaane main dilli sarkaar kaa afasar fasebuk live ke bare main nahi jaanata

 bijepi main pichley 13 varshon se rashtriya mahasachiv (sanghathan) kaa pad sambhaal rahe raamalaal kii vidaai ke baad ab biel santosh ko yah jimmedaari mili he
 This information was made public on Sunday by the BJP
 biel santosh ab tak raamalaal ke sahyogi ke taur par na sirf party main sanyukt mahasachiv kii jimmedaari sambhaal rahe the, balki dakshin bharat ke prabharee ke taur par sambandhit rajyon main bijepi ke prasar kii zimmedaari bhi un par rahi
 Santhosh, who holds the image of the Sangh's hardliner campaigner in Karnataka, is known for his efficient handling of the war room during elections
 rahete lo profile hai, lekin parade ke peeche ranneetiyaan banane main maahir maane jate hai
 However, his clarity makes BJP uncomfortable at times
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko bhi karnataka main yediurppa se unki siyaasi muthbhed ko lekar ateet main kai baar dakhal dena padaa he
 Engineer, unmarried and publicist BL Santosh, who hails from Shivamoga district in Karnataka, has been a chemical engineer by profession
 aresas kii vichaardhaara is kadar man main rach bas gai ki is ejeeniyar ne grihasth jivan basaane kaa iraadaa hi chhod diya
 While remaining unmarried, BL became a full-time pracharak of Santosh Sangh
 karnataka sahit dakshin bharat ke aadhe darjan rajyon main sangh or anushangik sanghathanon main bhoomikaayen nibhaate rahe
 After joining BJP, BSY nor Suhaarss sent BL Santosh, who worked as a pracharak, to BJP later
 tab vah karnataka pradesh sanghathan main aresas cote se sanghathan mahaamantri bane
 In the 2008 assembly elections, BL Santosh had chalked out a complete strategy behind the scenes
 jiskaa nateeja rahaa ki bijepi ko chunaav main jeet milane par dakshin ke is soobe main satta naseeb hui
 But later, BL Santosh started a scuffle with Yeddyurappa
 vah yediurppa kii chhavi ko party ke liye khatra maanate rahe
 In 2011, Yeddyurappa was forced to resign from the post of CM when the BJP general secretary, who was appointed BL Santosh, replaced Ram Lal
 bataaya jaataa he ki yediurppa ko biel santosh kii ore se kendriya netritv ke saamne bhoomika baandhne or dabaav daalane kii vajah se hi istipha dena padaa tha
 Since then the distance between the two has increased
 khatpat zyaada badhane par bijepi ne biel santosh ko rashtriya team main bataur sanyukt mahasachiv bula liya
 Sources say that even though BL Santosh is now in BJP politics, he takes the stand as a pracharak on various issues
 karnataka main yediurppa kii politics ko party kii image karaab karne vaala bataate hue kai baar naaraazgi zaahir kar chuke hai
 Even when BJP President Amit Shah had arrived on a three-day visit to Bangalore before the Lok Sabha elections, he had pledged Santosh and Yeddyurappa to sit together and work with them
 lekin phir bhi donon netaaon ke bich kii dooriyaan kam nahin huin
 Santosh, who has been active on social media, was also in the news during the election, in which he said that those who do not work with team spirit are not successful
 is coment ko yediurppa se jodakar dekha gaya tha
 Although Yeddyurappa Camp has been alleging that even though BL Santosh is in the national team, his eyes remain on Karnataka, he wants to see himself in the BJP as CM candidate instead of Yeddyurappa, while BL Santosh Camp people Dismissing the matter, he says, 'he is a full-time pracharak, worrying about BJP organization in Karnataka does not mean ambition for CM post
 'kyon ahm hota he mahasachiv sanghathan kaa pad?bhartiya janata party main rashtriya mahasachiv bhale hi kai ho sakate hai, lekin mahasachiv sanghathan kaa pad ek hota he

 Similarly, in the states too, the post of organization minister is available only to the RSS pracharak or the person associated with the background

 In a way, the General Secretary's organization represents the RSS in the bjp's policy meetings
 diene profiling adwijuri cameti banane ke saath hi saal 2003 main pehali baar diene technology ko viniyamit yani regulate karne kii koshish shuru kii gai
 a draft bill has been made on this basis
 saal 2012 main ek or export cameti banaai gai jisamen niztaa se jude muddon ko shaamil kiya gaya or draft main sanshodhan kiye gaye
 Subsequently, in July 2017, the Law Commission approved it, but there were many issues related to privacy which are being debated and the matter is pending in the Supreme Court
 ek maheene baad agast 2017 main supreme court kii 9 sadasyeey bench ne ek swar main niztaa ko samvidhan ke artical 21 ke tahat moulik adhikaar ghoshit kiya
 The DNA Technology Regulation Bill 2019 was passed by the Lok Sabha in January this year, but then it was not passed by the Rajya Sabha and the bill was repealed
 badi takat ke saath jab modi sarkaar satta main waapas lauti to ise july 2019 main ek baar phir sidhe rajyasabha main pesh kiya gaya he, abhi ise loksabhaa se paas karana baaki he
 What is there in the bill? The bill seeks to establish the identities of people belonging to special categories including victims, criminals, suspects, under trials, missing and unidentified persons through DNA technology
 bill kaa makasad diene testing ke liye prayogshaalaon kaa vinimikaran, rajya or rashtriya str par diene data bank banane or ek diene regulatory board bananaa he
 The DNA Regulatory Board will be headed by a secretary-level officer on this board, with all the scientists, forensic and legal matters related to DNA science in the board and top officials of all police and security agencies like DG of NIA, Director of CBI and all on rotation basis
 The DGP and the National Human Rights Board of the states will be headed by the Chairman
 board kii praathmik jimmedaariyaan-sarkaar ko diene lab, data bank, guideline banane or in data bainkon ko chalaane ke saamaanya niyam banane main sahyog dena-diene lab ko manyata dena-faujadaari ke maamalon main jaanch agenciyon kii madad karnaa-niztaa ke maamalon kaa vishesh khyaal rakhana-jo maamle board ke adhikaar main honge un maamalon ko court ke daayre main nahin laayaa ja saktaa he
 According to the collection and use of DNA data, DNA testing can be allowed only to prove the identity of a person such as: - Cases under the IPC where DNA test helps in the investigation
 -dehavyapaar, maanav taskari, garbhpaat,gharelu hinsa, dalit or adivaasiyon ke khilaaf atyaachaar or motor vical act-paariwarik maamle, bachche kii pahchaan or vanshavali, maanav ang pratyaropan, apravasana ke dauraan vyakti kii pahchaan-medical gadabadi, mrit vyakti kii pahchaan or laavaaris bachediene sample ke liye rajinamamrityudand yaa 7 saal se upar kii sajaa se jude maamalon main aaropee se kisi bhi tarah kii ijaajat kii jarurat nahin he lekin kam sajaa vaale maamalon main aaropee kaa rajamandi jaruri he
 Especially if the person is an accused or a relative of the missing person
 viklang or naaballig ke maamalon main parivaar yaa abhibhavak kaa likhit rajinama jaruri he
 In any case, refusal may be taken from the Magistrate
 diene profile hataanaa- bill main praavdhaan he ki agar koi vyakti na sandigdh ho or na hi aaropee ho to ek baar diene jaanch puri hone ke baad data bank se likhit anurodh par uskaa profile hataaya bhi ja saktaa he
 Punishment and Penalty - Taking or using DNA sample without telling or without proper permission can carry a penalty of three years or a fine of up to 1 lakh, while 5 years in jail for destroying, altering or tampering DNA or 2 Fines up to a million may be imposed
 kyon laayaa gaya bill?bill ko pesh karte vakt ye kaaran diye gaye ki diene technology se civil or faujadaari ke maamalon main nyaayik prakriya par jabardast asar hoga
 Biological evidence such as criminal cases such as viscera in rape cases, blood in murder cases and spits in case of unintentional letters can be examined
 civil ke maamle jaise aapadaa ke peediton or vimaan durghatana main diene jaanch upyogi sabit hogi
 Regulators are necessary for misuse of DNA test so that society or any person is not harmed
 desh main niztaa or data ko surakshit rakhane par khadey hue kai savaldilli ke forencik medicine or kanoon ke jaankaar dow gaurav agarwal ne is bill par kai sawaal uthaaye hai
 According to him, DNA profiling will become like a base and will gradually engulf the whole society
 dow agarwal ne kaha, 'sarkaar kaa iraadaa thik ho saktaa he lekin ham ab har vakt sarkaar kii nigaraanee main rahane vaale desh banane kii ore bad rahe hai
 For example, there is no need for DNA profile in civil case, finger prints are enough
 kai maamalon main to ye diene jaanch se bhi behatar he jaise judwa logon ke maamle main diene ek hoga, lekin finger print alag honge
 He also says that there is no need to keep DNA samples
 iskaa baad main galat istemaal ho saktaa he
 DNA samples of suspects should not be allowed
 duniya bhar main sirf behad khatarnaak kism ke aparaadhon main hi diene sample liye jate hai
 No samples of suspects are taken
 diene data ko hack kiya ja saktaa he or ek baar taiyaar kiya digital data kabhi khatm nahin hota use mitaane ke baad bhi phir se ritreve yani waapas laayaa ja saktaa he
 Dr
 Aggarwal believes that India first needs to enact laws related to privacy and saving personal data
 khaastaur par tab jab supreme court ne niztaa ko moulik adhikaar ghoshit kar diya he
 He also warns and says, "due to the lack of stringent laws and the absence of rules, there is a great risk of misuse of DNA samples in India

 kya pathar kaa jawaab goli or bike kaa jawaab bandook ho saktaa he? sunne main atapata lage, par kya kijiega, dilli police ne yahi kar dikhaaya
 In order to control the bike stunting youth on the road of Delhi, the police directly fired a bullet
 firing main ek noujvaan kii maut ho gai, jabaki doosraa jakhmi ho gaya
 Actually, these were the same bikers, who go out on the streets of Delhi on special days and special occasions and start stunting on the road
 zaahir he ki ye kanoon kaa ulanghan he, par isaki sazaa maut nahin ho sakati
 Delhi, the capital of the country
 
 
 or dilli kaa sabase ahm, sabase khaas, sabase mahfuj, sabase viviipi ilaaka
 Parliament House a few hundred meters away, then Rashtrapati Bhavan at a distance
 in sabake bich india get or usase sata hua ashoka road
 The same, where the BJP is headquartered
 jagah or naam se hi aap samaj gaye honge ki ilaaka kis kadar viviipi he
 Of course, then the security of the police at such a place will be the same
 kuch shaukia stantbaaz khaas maukon par raat ke andhere main apni-apni bike ke saath khuleam khuli sadak par kartab dikhaate hai
 There is no doubt that such stunting is wrong on the moving road, messing with the law
 par inaki sazaa goli or maut bhi to nahin ho sakati naa? par yahi hua he
 The young men who were juggling bikes openly on the streets of Delhi were punished for breaking the law
 goli maari dilli police ne
 Although these bikers were caught breaking the law in this crime, they would have gone home from the police station with bail, because their punishment could not be punished
 27 july ko raat ke 2
 Round post office area at 30 o'clock
 kareeb-kareeb har shanivaar-ravivaar kii raat kii tarah hi kareeb 30 se 40 bike savaar gol daakkhaana par ikattha hote hai bike par kartab dikhaane ke liye
 But earlier this night, police was ready around India Gate
 isaki vajah ye thi ki pichley dinon inhen bike savaaron kii kartab kii khabar lagaataar media main ai or dilli police kii bebasii par sawaal uthaae gaye
 So this time the police was determined to stop the arbitrariness of these bikers
 lihaaza jaise hi bikers gol daakkhaane par ikattha hue or kartab dikhaanaa shuru kiya, tabhi kisi ne sau number par police ko kol kar diya
 These bikers had to go from the round post office to India Gate, doing tricks
 par raste main inaki masti dekh kisi ne sau number par police ko phone kar diya
 The PCR van reached the spot as soon as the call arrived
 bikeron ne police ko apane peeche aata dekh kar bhaagna shuru kar diya
 Now the race started between the police and the bikers
 bikers ashok road se hote hue hotel lee-meradian ke nazadik ja pahunche, lekin police yahaan bhi unka peechha kar rahi thi
 Meanwhile the police, meanwhile, suddenly some bikers started throwing stones at the PCR van
 
 
 or yaheen par police ko gussa aa gaya
 Police responded to the stone with a bullet
 dilli police ne ek biker kaa nishaanaa liya or goli chalaa di
 The bullet hit the neck of young Karan Pandey, sitting on the back of the bike
 goli lagate hi wo neeche gir padaa
 After this, the police fired another shot
 is baar goli bike chalaa rahe punit sharma ke haath or qamar ko chooti hui nikal gai
 Both are later rushed to the hospital, where Karan is killed, while Puneet is out of danger
 patthak kii jagah goli yaa bike kii jagah bandook kaa istemaal gussa dilaane vaala tha
 So soon after the incident, senior police officers started clarifying that the police were aiming for the bike wheel so that the tire was punctured
 naujavaanon ko goli maarane kaa koi iraadaa nahin tha
 It is very likely that the police are right
 par sawaal ye he ki bina goli chalaae bhi unhen pakadaa ja saktaa tha
 If not there, at some other point, then why so quick to fire? How much police logic? On the one hand, the police say that the bikers were stoned
 duusari taraf ye bhi kahati he ki biker bhaag rahe the
 Then the same Delhi Police also says that he had shot to catch the running bikers, that too on the bike tire and not the bike rider
 lekin sawaal ye uthta he ki akhir bike par dilli ke aam noujvaan baithe the, na ki koi aatakanvaadi
 Then the situation was not like this, then why did he shoot again? Police spokesman Rajan Bhagat says that his intention was not to take the life of a biker doing a stunt on the road, but rather to shoot at a bike tire and puncture it
 Were
 lekin ye biker hi the, jinhone achaanak apni bike kaa aglaa chakkaa upar kar liya, jisase goli bike ke peeche baithe noujvaan ko ja lagi
 That is, the bikers were also at fault here
 bhagat sahab ke bayaan se yah baat saafe he ki jin bikeron par police ne goli chalaai, unka kam-se-kam police se aamanaa-saamana to katai nahin ho rahaa tha, balki wo to police se bachakar bhaag rahe the
 But still the police shot them from behind
 aise main sawaal yah uthta he ki akhir police ko bhaagate naujavaanon ko pakadaney kii aisi kya zarurat thi, jo unase bike ke tair pankchar karne ke liye goli chalaane jaisaa khataranaak risk liya? sadak par stant kar rahe biker koi aatankwaadi yaa criminal nahin the, jinhen har haal main pakadana police ke liye zaruri tha
 Then what was the need of firing like this? Believe the Delhi Police, bikers threw stones at the police car, which also caused injuries to some policemen
 lekin rukkar police par patharav karnaa or bike chalaakar bhaagna- do alag chizein hai
 It is the police who are saying that he opened fire to puncture the tire
 yani tab biker bhaag rahe the
 The question is that if the bikers were running away, then why did the police not let them go? That is, this action of the police seems to be less in retaliation and self-defense, but more in the act of Khundak
 vaise bhaagate hue bikeron kaa police par patharav karnaa jitna ajeeb he
 Equally suspicious is the fact that bikers have brick-stones in the clean Lutyens zone
 vaise bhi vaardaat ke baad sadak par itane eent-pathar pade hue nahin mili, jise dekhakar yah kaha ja sake ki vaaki bikeron ne police ke liye goli chalaane ke sivaay or koi rasta hi nahin choda tha
 In such a situation, if the tire of a bike was also punctured at a high speed due to the police bullet, then the accident caused by it could kill not only the biker but also other people
 police kii yah goli sadak par kisi begunaah shaks ko bhi lag sakati thi
 By the way, now the matter is being investigated
 mumkin he ki is jaanch se shaayad doodh kaa doodh or pani kaa pani bhi ho jaae, lekin police kii goli se jaan ganvaane vaala ladkaa ab kabhi bhi lautakar nahin aayega
 Actually, this pastime of stunting on the bikes of the youth of Delhi is not new
 saikadon-darjanon baar ye sadakon par pehle bhi huddang machaate rahe hai, par police ne kabhi inhen gambhirtha se liya hi nahin
 So they got encouraged
 ek vaqt to vah tha, jab isi stantbaazi ne dilli ke kuch ladakon ko rupahale parde par chamakane kaa mauka diya
 But it is obvious that this feat cannot be justified publicly on the streets
 bahut kam hi log jaanate hai ki 1983 main ai film 'hero' ke gane main stant dikhaa rahe hero ke doston main do dost isi dilli ke hai, jinhen bike par stant karne ke shauk ne rupahale parde par aane kaa mauka diya
 Then what? Stunting on the bike became a favorite pastime for youngsters from all over Delhi and especially Old Delhi
 iske baad vaqt guzara, halaat badale or ek rose bike par stant karanevaale dilli ke ek noujvaan ko hi police kii goli se apni jaan ganvaani padi
 As long as this pastime remained within the purview of laws, all was well
 lekin jaise hi stantbaazi kaanoon todakar sadakon utar ai, dikkatein shuru ho gayi
 Time and time and especially on the festive occasions, the youth of Delhi made such a stunt in the middle of the road that it became difficult for the police to handle them
 dilli ke naujavaanon ke liye apni khushi or josh ke izhaar kaa yah wo tarika he, jo ab kaayade-kaanoon par baari padane laga he
 As the night progresses, these bike riders take possession of the streets of Delhi and then start dangerous stunts
 vaise to aise stantbaazi ke liye khaas din shanivaar yaa ravivaar hi hota he, lekin parv-tyoharon ke maukon par jaise ye noujvaan zyaada hi belgaum ho jate hai
 What Guru Parab, what Shabe-procession and what Guru Poornima
 
 
 tarikh gavaah he ki saikadon kii taadaad main dilli kii sadakon par bikeron ne stantbaazi kii he or police tamashbin bani sabakuch dekhati rahi he
 Moreover, on winning the cricket match of India, the streets of Delhi have been stunted
 jaraa gaur kiijie ki apane maje ke liye stantbaazi karte in ladakon ko naa to apni jaan kii fikr he or naa hi kaayade kaanoon kii
 Speed is not the helmet on the head of many boys
 zaahir he ki is stantbaazi se jahaan aam log pareshaan hote rahe hai, vahiin apni kahili kii vajah se police ko bhi logon ke gusse kaa shikaar hona padaa he
 But even then, the Delhi Police has always taken this matter of curbing the biker lightly
 ab achaanak neend se jaagi police ne jo kuch kiya he, usne jaise saare niyam-kaanoon hi tod die hai
 Police has opened fire where talk and poles can be used
 or nateeja ab ek biker kii maut kii shakl main saamne aayaa he
 The question arises that after all, who gave the police the right to kill someone? haal hi rahul gandhi apane vynad daure ke dauraan kalikat main nurse rajmma vavathil se milane pahunche the
 These are the same nurses who were present in the hospital at the time of Rahul's birth
 rahul or rajmma kii is mulaakaat ke baad inaki tasviren teji se soshal media par viral hone lagi hai
 It is being claimed with him that this is another lie of Rahul Gandhi as Rajamma was 13 years old when Rahul was born
 daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki rajmma kii ab umr 62 saal he
 Link of Claim India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the claim going viral is completely false
 rajmma kii umr 62 nahin 72 saal he, lihaaja rahul gandhi ke janm ke samay unki aayu 23 varsh thi
 The archived version of the post can be seen here
 fasebuk post par calculation dikhaate hue ye daawa pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 It has been written that Rajamma is 62 years old, while Rahul Gandhi is 49 years old, according to this, when Rahul was born, Rajamma was 13 years old
 itani choti umr main wo nurse kaise ho sakati hai
 To know the secret of Rajamma's age, when we started investigating, we got one or two such media reports in which her current age was 62 not 72 years
 jiske anusaar rahul gandhi ke janm ke samay yani ki 19 june 1970 ko rajmma kii umr 23 varsh thi
 At that time Rajamma was taking nursing training at Holy Family Hospital in New Delhi
 itnaa hi nahin hamen rajmma kapitiai ko diya bayaanbhi mila jisamen unhone kaha tha: "main bhaagyashaalee thi, kyonki main un kuch logon main se thi jinhone janm ke baad navjaat ko apane haathon main liya tha, wo bada sundar tha, main unke janm kii sakshi hum, ham log romanchit the, pradhanmantri indira gandhi ke pote ko dekh ham behad romanchit the
 "with Times Fact Check, Rajamma also shared pictures of some of her documents, including her driving license, on which her date of birth is written as 1 June 1947
 iske alaava unka nursing kaa certificate he, yah certificate punjab nurse registration council kii ore se 11 may 1970 main jari kiya gaya tha
 Not only this, he also shared the picture of his nursing diploma, he received this diploma on 29 November 1970 from the School of Nursing of Holy Family Hospital after a course of six months
 itnaa hi nahin unhone 1970 main holi family hospital main hi khinchi gai group photo bhi saajha kii
 It became clear in the investigation that Rajamma was born in 1947, so she was 23 years old when Rahul was born

 Raman Raghav 2, as he himself said, was immersed by Bombay Valvet
 0 unhen paar lagaaegi
 Perhaps he was right, because this time he was going to trust the artist, not the star
 bombai vailvet jahaan ranbir kapur or anoushka sharma jaise bade stars ke kandhon par tiki film thi or bade bajet kii film thi, lekin anuraag to tehre actaron ke diarector, isliye film ve box offis par post ho gai thi
 This time he appeared in his familiar style and accompanied a dark thriller
 bombai vailvet main jahaan sets par daanv lagaaya tha, vahiin raman raghav main anuraag ne mumbai or uske slam ko apana vishay banaaya he
 ALSO READ: Film Review: Disappoints 'X: Past is Present' He relied on his investigative Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Nawaz proved that it is difficult to find his point when it comes to acting
 film ko dekhne ke baad yahi baat samaj aati he ki yah film anuraag kii nahin balki navazuddin kii he
 Of course the director of the film is Anurag, and he has coined the character, but it is Nawaz who has made Ramanna, who was murdered for fun, alive on screen
 vaise udata punjab ke baad raman raghav 2
 a glimpse of Urdi Mumbai can also be seen while watching 0
 yah film 1960 ke dashak ke psycopath serial killer raman raghav par aadhaarit he jisane lagbhag 41 logon kaa katl kiya tha
 The story has been composed in the current era
 ramanna (navazuddin) ek psycopath killer he or vah maje ke liye katl karata he
 He goes to the police and takes responsibility for the nine slaughter but no one believes him
 police thane main navaj jo katl karne kaa seen khinchate hai, vah vaaki yaadgaar he
 Anyway, Ramna kills people in the same natural way as Nawaz has engraved the character of Ramanna
 film main ek police adhikari raghavan (viki kaushal) he jo nashe kaa shikaar he or ek ladki simi (shobhita dhulipala) ke saath rahata he
 On the other hand, Ramanna is engaged in murder, while Raghav is seen trying to catch him and the police officer keeps getting entangled with his drunk and girlfriends
 kahani ke naam par ek serial killer, uske katl or nashe kaa shikaar police adhikari he
 The story of the film is quite drawn and the entire film runs very slow
 interwel ke baat film thodi dhili bhi pad jaati he
 The durations of the murder scene could have been slightly less
 agar viki or simi kii chemistry ko thodaa sameta gaya hota to film kii dhar or paini ho jaati he
 The film is on the shoulders of only one person and he is Nawazuddin
 ek psycopath killer kis tarah kaa ho saktaa he use lekar navaj ne silverscreen par aisi misaal kaayam kar di he, jis tak pahunchnaa aane vaale samay main kaaphi mushkil hoga
 Seeing their manner of speaking, emotion and slaughter, it comes out of the mouth that acting is called it
 viki kaushal or shobhita ne bhi acchhee acting kii he
 Anyway, if someone is waiting in the film at all times, it is Ramanna
 film kaa bajet lagbhag chaar karod ru
 Is told
 is tarah film ghate main to nahin rahane vaali
 Nawazuddin had said before the film's release that the film was too mentally exhausting for him
 is baat ko unke is samvaad se bakhubi samajha bhi ja saktaa he, 'apun to kya na he saab paidaa hi nishachar hua he
 Our father used to call Apun a fox

 You are such a ridiculous person
 ' Former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Babulal Gaur, who has always been in the limelight for his controversial statements, has now targeted his party after an offer from Congress to contest from Bhopal Lok Sabha seat
 babulal gaur ne madhya pradesh samet teen rajyon main haar ke liye tikat vitaran par bhi sawaal uthaae hai or isamen kahin naa kahin varisht netaaon ko nazarandaaj kiye jane ko jimmedaar bataaya he
 Taking a dig at the BJP high command, Babulal Gaur said that the BJP was no longer the party that used to take everyone along, whereas the Congress was a scattered party, but is now working in unison
 babulal gaur ne kaha ki bijepi ab kushabhau thakare vaali party nahin bachi he jinhone bijepi ko farsh se arsh tak pahunchaaya or jo hameshaa sabko saath lekar chale
 Gaur said that 'senior power leaders are now being sidelined in Madhya Pradesh'
 babulal gaur ne netaaon ke naam lekar kaha ki 'raghunandan sharma, lakshmikant sharma, raghav ji, kusamariya hon yaa phir sartaaj singh, party ne sabhi ko darkinar kar diya he jabaki varisht netaaon ke bina party kaa bhavishya thik nahin he or loksabhaa chunaav main iskaa khamiyaja party ko uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 After this statement of Kinarababulal Gaur from BJP, Aaj Tak wanted to take a response from former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, then he refused to speak on it
 kya congress daal rahi he gaur par dana?aapako bataa den ki ek din pehle hi babulal gaur ne yah daawa kiya tha ki congress netaa digvijay singh ne unhen bhopal loksabhaa seat se bataur congress ummidavaar chunaav ladane kaa ofer diya he
 There was a panic in BJP after Gaur's statement and now Gaur's questioning his party directly can definitely make it difficult for BJP

 »immediate reservation on the website will be easy, preparing to strengthen the server for Internet tickets
 »yah sambhaavna bhi jataai ja rahi he ki tatkaal tikat booking ke samay or kisi bhi prakaar ke tikat booking nahin hogi

 '(input-ieenes) The bjp's veteran leader and presently the statement by the Governor of Rajasthan, Kalyan Singh, who made the BJP government and Narendra Modi once again the Prime Minister, can increase their troubles
 chunaav ayog ne kalyaan singh ke bayaan ko chunaav aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan maanate hue raashtrapati ramnath kovind ko patr likhakar is maamle ko sangyaan lene kii baat kahi he
 In the 90s, Himachal Pradesh Governor Gulsher Ahmed had to resign due to violation of the code of conduct
 bataa den ki kalyaan singh ne pichley maheene 23 march ko apane grih janapad aligarh kaa daura kiya tha
 During this, he made a political statement
 kalyaan singh ne kaha tha, 'ham sabhi log bhaajapa ke kaaryakarta hai or is naate se ham jarur chahenge ki bhaajapa vijayi ho
 We all would like Modiji to become Prime Minister once again
 modiji kaa pradhanmantri bananaa desh or samaaj ke liye aavashyak he
 Kalyan Singh was once a stalwart of the BJP and is currently the Governor of Rajasthan
 aise main kalyaan singh ke is bayaan ko lekar raajnneetik sargharmiyaan tej ho gai he
 The opposition termed it a violation of the code of conduct
 darasal kalyaan singh ke bete rajvir singh uttar pradesh ke eta loksabhaa seat se bijepi ummidavaar ke taur par chunaav lard rahe hai
 Apart from this, Aligarh seat is also considered to have political influence of Kalyan Singh
 aligarh jile kii atarauli vidhansabha seat se vidhayak or yogi sarkaar main mantri hai
 In such a situation, Kalyan Singh's statement is being viewed politically
 kalyaan singh se pehle 90 ke dashak main rajyapal ke dwaara chunavi aachaar samhita ulanghan kaa maamla saamne aayaa tha, jiske baad rajyapal ko apane pad se istipha dena padaa tha
 The case dates back to 1993, when the Governor of Himachal Pradesh was Gulsher Ahmed and his son Saeed Ahmed was contesting the assembly from Amrapattan seat in Madhya Pradesh
 rajyapal gulsher ahamed apane bete ke chunaav prachaar ke liye amarpttan seat pahunch gaye the
 After this, the Election Commission had expressed its displeasure over the Governor's move, after which Gulsher Ahmed had to resign
 aise main gulsher ahamed maamle kii tarah hi kalyaan singh ke bayaan ko dekha ja rahaa he
 This is the reason why the Election Commission has asked the President to take cognizance
 kalyaan singh ke bayaan ko lekar rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne bhi twit karke kaha tha rajyapal kaa pad ek sanvaidhanik pad hota he
 In a democracy, the governor is expected to maintain fairness and distance from all parties

 The tightening of the CBI over the opposition leaders of the state before the Rajasthan assembly elections has created a similar political upheaval as it did in the Amit Shah case during the Gujarat elections
 is baar ghere main hai vasundhara raaje sarkaar main grih mantri rahe or maujuuda netaa pratipaksh gulabchand kataaria
 Whether it is a coincidence or a conspiracy, the court will decide, but the cbi's clamping down on the former home minister in Gujarat and Rajasthan as soon as the assembly elections begin, is a fact
 sibiai kii yah koshish tab he, jab rajasthan se jude paanch ahm maamalon kii jaanch main jaanch agency kii saakh ko dhakka laga he
 The recent case relates to Kataria, who has been accused by the CBI of being a conspirator in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case
 agency ne poorak chargeshit main unhen aaropee banaaya he
 Kataria is one of the senior leaders of the BJP, who has the support of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)
 bijepi main vasundhara raaje ke dhur virdohi maane jane vaale kataaria ko haal hi main andruni samjhaute ke tahat netaa pratipaksh kii kaman saunpi gai he or raaje ko pradesh adhyaksh banaaya gaya he
 Kataria's latest case is going to be a shock for the BJP in solidarity
 yahi vajah he ki raaje samet bijepi kaa sheersh netritv kataaria ke bachaav main utar aayaa he or congress par sibiai ke beja istemaal kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Kataria is accused of being the home minister of the state in 2005
 ke
 The action was taken at the behest of Vimal Patni, director of Marbles Private Limited and associated with the then Home Minister of Gujarat Amit Shah
 shah ko is maamle main hi pehle giraftaar kiya gaya or philhal ve jamaanat par hai
 The CBI says that before the 2005 murder of Sohrabuddin, he paid Rs 24 crore from Patni
 maange the, jiske baad paatani ne kataaria se madad maangi
 Patni told India Today, "nobody ever threatened me, nobody ever asked for a ransom
" maine kabhi kisi se isaki koi shikaayat nahin kii
 i am really shocked by the media reports about this
 ''vasundhara raaje isamen badi sajeesh dekh rahi hai
 He told reporters on May 16, "the CBI was supposed to file the final charge sheet by March this year, but the filing of the supplementary charge sheet is actually linked to Rahul Gandhi's visit to Bikaner and Jaipur
" party kaaryakartaaon ne unki meetingon main bhi gahalot ke kushasan or farji yojanaon kaa khulaasa kar hi diya he
 The BJP launched a statewide shutdown on May 18 against this misuse of the CBI
 party is mudde ko sahanubhuti ke taur par bhunaane main jute gai he
 Says a police officer, "let's also assume that it was a fake encounter, whether there is a case of corruption in government contracts, death in custody, police firing or negligence, all the DGP, Home Minister and Chief Minister Should also be made accused
 ''kataaria maamle main abhi court kaa rukh aana baaki he, lekin sibiai ne is baar bhi bilkul vahi sab kiya jo usne jaipur vaale daara muthbhed maamle main kiya tha
 All the important evidence there also confirms the last fact that Dara died in police custody
 sibiai sirf ek phone kol kaa hawala detii he jo bijepi netaa rajendra rathod or tatkaaleen ediji e
 K
 jain ke bich he, or nishkarsh nikaal leti he ki rathod ne jain ko daara kii hatya kaa aadesh diya tha
 Jain is currently in jail in this case
 sibiai ke mutabik, daara apradhi tha or usne rathod ko maarane kii dhamkee di thi, jiske baad uski hatya kar di gai
 But like the Sohrabuddin case, there is no such complaint related to the threat which Rathore has lodged with the police
 or koi sakshya nahin he, jisase sabit ho sake ki daara ne vastav main dhamkee di thi
 The gangster owner of Dara Singh was incidentally taken into police custody but was not killed
 rathod ke paksh main kanoonee daleelein hone ke baavjood sibiai kii unke khilaaf karrwai se soobe main rajput vot kaa sameekaran gadabadata dikh rahaa he or mana ja rahaa he ki isse congress ko thik usee tarah nuksaan ho saktaa he, jaisaa soharabuddin maamle main vyapaariyon ke saath hua he
 But the Congress probably felt that the CBI action against Rathore would lead to Jat votes in his favor, as Dara Singh was a Jat
 par mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne bhavari devi hatyakand main sab gudzobar kar daalaa
 The CBI is yet to gather any evidence against Jat leader Mahipal Maderna, who was removed from the post of minister in the case and is currently serving a day in jail, that he ordered Bhanwari's murder

 In such a situation, if the pictures of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar are missing from the poster banner at any government event, then there is a lot of speculation to arise
