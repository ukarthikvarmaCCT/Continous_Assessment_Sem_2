 Many call you number 2 in JD (U)
 main is tag se bahut asahaj mahasoos karata hum
 These are the talks of Nitish's successor, the future of the party or the number 2, it is simply the brain of the people
 mujhe abhi party main do-teen maheene hue hai
 i understand Bihar a little bit, but not so much that i claim to be number two, number three

 Then Patna Science College came
 maths acchhee thi, ghar waalon kii ichha bhi thi, to maths le lee
 Took Statistics in Hindu College
 magar vahaan se tabiyat kharaab hone kii vajah se chhod aayaa
 Graduation done from Lucknow
 phir hyderabad gaya, america gaya, ejineering, doctorl phir civil sarvice vaala koi routine nahin follow kiya
 Dropped studies every two years
 barahavin ke baad teen saal chodi, phir grajuation ke baad do saal chodi
 My father used to sit on hunger strike
 kehete the ki waapas jaao, padhai karo
 You came with Modi and then got released
 kya hua tha?agar aapkaa sawaal yah he ki main alag kyon hua, to uski vajah vah nahin he jo aap padhate hai
 Before the election, there was a thinking with him that there is a great need for lateral entry in civil services in India
 uske liye hi ham sanstha bananaa chaahate the
 An organization that works with the Prime Minister's Office
 hamane axenture or maikenji ke saath is par kaam kiya
 He (modi) also agreed
 is par kaaphi paisa bhi laga
 But his preoccupation increased after the 2014 election
 ve thodaa vakt ruknaa chaahate the
 i am a very important man
 phir aktubar-november main mujhe laga ki yahaan baat nahin ban rahi he
 i met Nitishji for the first time in November
 nitish kumaar se main pawan verma ji ke ghar par mila
 In the same meeting, he said that you come together
 narendra modi ne roka nahin?bahut roka
 i was working with Nitish ji since November (2014), but came to Bihar on 2 June 2015
 yah jo chah maheene kaa samay tha jisamen unase (modi se) baatcheet chalati rahi
 But they too thought that if i want to go and do something else, it is okay
 ve meraa swabhaav jaanate hai
 And then PK himself became the leader
 bilkul
 Earlier there was no idea of joining politics
 phir meraa anubhav chaar-paanch saal kaa yah rahaa ki aap chaahe jitna adwise kar len, par (ve) aapaki baat jeetne ke baad maane, na maane
 i had both exams
 modiji ne temprarali to us samay baat nahin hi maani, nitish ji ne maani, lekin donon hi sthiti main main vah achiv nahin kar paaya, jo main chahta tha
 Then i joined politics
 nitish ne phir bhaajapa se dosti kii tab?nitish kumaar kaa faisla rajnatik faisla tha
 This is right from the perspective of Bihar
 meri samaj se unka faisla thik tha, lekin tarika galat
 When he went back with the BJP, he should have taken a fresh mandate
 lalu se kya baat hui thi?ames main lalu se unke haalchaal par baat hui
 Political talk also happened, there are no two opinions in this
 rahi tejasvi kii baat, to unase meri baat nahin hoti
 How about Amit Shah? He is a very hard working person
 maine unke saath bahut lanbaa kaam nahin kiya he, lekin main samajhataa hum ki teradishnal chunaav ladgaye kaa jo tarika he, use amit shah behatar samajhate hai
 Their understanding of the cadres and organizational things of the party is better than that of the leaders
 pike kaa mishan upi kyon fail hua?bihar jeetne ke baad nitish ke shapath grahan samaaroh main rahul gandhi se meri mulaakaat hui
 He said let's help us
 farvari 2016 main phir ek charchaa hui
 Three months of up's search and made a plan
 rahul kii kisaan yatra us plan kaa hissaa thi
 30 days from Deoria to Delhi
 maine unhen bataaya ki ek baar aap jab bas par baithenge devaria main, to jab tak aap dilli nahin pahunch jate, aapako upi main hi rahanaa he
 When Deoria visited, there was a talk in the Congress that it had become a big breeze and they took it off
 jin akhilesh yadav se aaj ek seat nahin mil rahi he, unheen akhilesh yadav ne 110 seat di congress ko
 So, on the grass root route, the congress was started to be encashed by the Congress, which later proved to be a disaster
 uddhav thakare se kya baat hui?meri kai dfa unase baat hui he
 The series of those meetings began, he was on the stand with his party on North Indians
 maine data or chizon ko dekhakar unako samajhane kii koshish kii ki idologicli jo ho, ellection main iskaa phayda nahin milegaa
 He understood the point
 us sandarbh main meri unase baatcheet shuru hui
 How do pk's organizations choose the political campaign of any party with Ipac? Criteria is ever childish that in Punjab we will show that we are better campaigners than you, ever Criteria is that i will launch Priyanka and the biggest win in UP i can achieve vah upi kaa criteria tha
 The criterion of working with Nitish ji was that brother worked with Modiji and Modiji had defeated Nitish ji badly here
 to ham logon ne kaha ki modi army ne modi wave main jinako haraaya he, agar ulataa kar den to kahenge ki kuch jaanate hai
 But only on these things there is no decision, and there are many factors
 netaa banane kaa faisla?is faisle main ek bebasii bhi he
 There was an incident in Punjab, which changed my decision
 punjab main jo sanvida vaale karmchaaree hai, unako lekar ek promis kiya tha
 In Punjab, i campaigned for a nine-point election
 usamen ek sanvida karmchaariyon ko lekar promis kiya gaya he
 a year later i came to know that the contract workers were sitting on a dharna and could not meet the Chief Minister
 unhone akhbaar main ek vigyaapan nikaala ki jo hamaari mulaakaat chif ministar amarinder singh se kara degaa, usko ek lakh rupye inaam diya jayega
 AAP MLA and Leader of the Opposition Aman Arora tweeted this ad and said that the biggest fraud in the country is Prashant Kishore, because before the election 'har Ghar Captain, Ghar Ghar Captain', 'coffee with Captain' and Elections After No Ware Captain
 is aadmi ko bulaao or isko khadaa karo janata ke saamne
 At the same time, it was understood that people search for the performer more than the promisor
 mujhe laga ki ab samay aa gaya he ki isko chhodie, kyonki doosraa galati karata he or phir lambey samay tak log aapako frod maanate hai
 If you are not working for money, then there should be a big goal in life
 vah gol jad (you) main dekha?vah gol bihar aane ko lekar dikhaa
 It is my commitment that in the next 10 years, Bihar should look to enter the top 10
 bihar main 14 saal main nitish ke raaj main bahut deveopment hua he lekin yah bhi sachaai he ki bihar vikaas ke zyaadaatar maanakon par bottm paanch main hi he
 Therefore, Bihar should try to figure out how to get into the top 10 in most standards of development and come back here for the help that i can help Nitishji in fulfilling that agenda

 And finally My Experiment with Truth, which every Indian should study
 gandhi ke liye chota munh badi baat he, lekin agar gandhi kii koi baat aapako acchhee nahin lagati he to samaj lijie ki aapane gandhi ko samajhane kii samaj develop nahin kii he

 Garg dismissed speculation that the cash crisis was due to the recent banking scam or the Financial Settlement and Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill
 garg ne kaha ki ho saktaa he ki kuch rajyon adhik nakad laabh vitarit kar rahe hon
 There may also be some psychological reasons that cash should be kept in the pocket instead of the bank

 One reason is the hoarding of cash

 The comments 2,000 rupee ke note par garg ne bataaya ki pranali main 6
 There are two thousand notes of Rs 7 lakh crore, which are more than enough to defeat the need for transactions
 haalanki iske saath hi unhone kaha ki kuch sayam se yah dekhne main aa rahaa he ki 2,000 ke note pranali main kam waapas ho rahe hai
 Garg said, "we have not yet examined it, but you may think that it is the best for hoarding

 Garg said that some states may be distributing more cash benefits
 kuch manovaigyanik vajah bhi ho sakati he ki bank ke rakhane ke bajaay jeb main nakadi rakhi jaae
 It has nothing to do with recent scams
 garg ne kaha ki nakadi kii maang asaamaanya rup se kaaphi oonchi ho gai he
 There are many reasons behind this
 ek vajah nakadi kii jamkhori he
 In some parts of the country, this trend is more rapid
 unhone kaha ki aisi bhi dharna ban rahi he ki bhavishya main nakadi kii kami ho sakati he
 Due to this also people have started withdrawing their money, which has caused this crisis
 garg ne kaha , ‘‘ ham karency noton kaa paryaapt stock rakhte hai
 This is equivalent to one sixth of the current currency in circulation
 ’’ abhi stock main do lakh karod rupee kii nakadi he or yah asaamaanya maang ko puraa karne ke liye paryaapt hai

 Garg said that the government will try to ensure that no matter of demand, there will be no shortage of cash
 atm main nakadi nahin hone ke bare main garg ne kaha ki kuch main samasya ho sakati he , lekin yah asthaayee he
 He said that one per cent of atms can usually go bad someday but this is a local management issue, not nationwide
 tippaniyan On the Rs 2,000 note, Garg reported that 6 in the system
 7 lakh karod rupee ke do hajaar ke note hai , jo lenden kii jarurat para karne ke liye jarurat se zyada hi hai
 However, with this, he said that it is being seen from some rule that 2,000 notes are getting reduced in the system
 garg ne kaha , ‘‘ hamane abhi isaki jaanch nahin kii he , lekin aap soch sakate hai ki ye jamkhori ke liye sabase achche he
 But this will not affect the supply of 2,000 notes
 ’’ He said that usually Rs 20,000 crore notes are supplied every month, but in the last two-three months it has increased from 40,000 to 45,000 crore rupees
 garg ne kaha ki ho saktaa he ki kuch rajyon adhik nakad laabh vitarit kar rahe hon

 surveykshan nilsan ne kiya he
 This survey shows that Delhi has the top colleges in all the five streams - Arts, Science, Commerce, Medicine and Fashion

 Delhi's nine colleges in science are in the top 40, while 12 colleges in the top colleges in commerce are located in Delhi
 sheersh 10 medical collejon main bhi 4 dilli ke hai
 One of the reasons for this geographical inclination towards Delhi is undoubtedly the job opportunities that the graduate students get from the colleges considered to be good in terms of general perception

 bataa den ki shuukravaar ko hi shivasena ne kaha ki maharashtra kaa siem shivasena kaa hi hoga
 The Shiv Sena was looking towards the NCP and the Congress with high hopes amidst the ongoing tussle with the BJP over the Chief Minister's chair
 shivasena ko aas he ki vah ensipi or congress ke samarthan se vah sarkaar bana legi
 But now that the Congress is ready to sit in the opposition, it is clear that Shiv Sena's expectations have suffered a major setback
 raut bole- mukhyamantri to shivasena kaa hi hogashivsena bijepi ko 50-50 formule kii yaad dilaai rahi he or bijepi isapar raji nahin he
 At the same time, Shiv Sena is also not backing down and is constantly making statements
 shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne kaha ki likhakar le lijie, mukhyamantri shivasena kaa hi hoga
 Apart from this, he also targeted BJP without naming him through tweet
 sanjay raut kaa ye bayaan tab aayaa he jab guuruuvaar ko unhone NCP pramukh sharad pavaar se mulaakaat kii thi
 This is the math of the seats in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly of 288 seats, needing 145 seats for the majority
 shivasena ke 56 or ensipi ke 54 vidhayak hai
 That means there are only 110 mlas, which is 35 less than the magic number of the majority
 aise main unhen congress ke 44 vidhayakon ke samarthan kii zarurat hoti
 But now that the Congress is ready to sit in the opposition, it will be very difficult for the Shiv Sena to form a government without BJP

 But it is truly shocking if the world's largest cricket board makes such a mistake in the selection of a player by the BCCI
 aisi hi ek galati karte hue BCCI ne rajasthan ke tej gendbaaj deepak chaahar ko newjiland ke khilaaf abhyaas match ke liye board adhyaksh ekadash team main shaamil kiya lekin baad main unhen unke chachere bhai rahul se badal diya jo leg spinner hai
 The BCCI issued a release yesterday in which the name of Deepak was included in the Board President's XI team, which raised questions as his performance was not effective for a place in the team
 baad main pataa chalaa ki chayankartarahul ko chunanaa chaahate thejo bharat ke under 19 khilaadi hai or haal main england daure par unhone acha pradarshan kiya tha
 However, it is understood that there was a mistake regarding the name, which led to this mistake
 bisisiai ne buudhvaar ko press vijyapti main galati sweekaar karte hue kaha, ‘galati se zikr kiya gayatha ki bharat ke khilaaf newjiland kii ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa se purv is team ke khilaaf abhyaas match main deepak chaahar board adhyaksh ekadash kaa pratinidhitiv karegaa

 Striker is said to be the spectator who takes off all his clothes and enters the field and tries to interrupt the game with his strolls
 kai baar khel ke dauraan josh yaa masti kii vajah se darshak aisi harakatein karte hai
 For the first time in cricket, 42 years ago today (4 August), in 1975, people were stunned to see the striker, that too in the mecca-lords of cricket
 tab england or australia ke bich ashes siries kaa doosraa test jari tha
 During this time, Michelangelo, who was a cook in the Merchant Navy, was first recorded in history as a striker
 darasal, us test match kaa chauthaa din kaaphi ubaau tha
 At that time England had a score of 399 / 6 in the second innings

 By the way, the spectators, who were sleeping on the field at that time, were suddenly surprised to see this strange scene

 Eventually the magistrate fined him 10 pounds

 To improve the condition of the city's roads, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is introducing a unique scheme
 BMC yojana bana rahi he ki agar nagarikon kii shikaayat par sadak par kisi gadde ko 24 ghanton ke bheetar nahin bharaa gaya to unhen 500 rupye kaa nakad puraskaar diya jayega

 com / fk260uah4d The ruckus over the conspicuous striped suit of Narendra Modi, which drew far more attention to Republic Day than the joint statement of nearly 4,000 words issued on Barack Obama's visit
 ke
 If Laxman had made a cartoon, what would he have commented? He would show Modi in the same suit and probably write something like that, do not waste time looking for something in it
 isaki bajaae mere honton ko padho kyonki tumne ab tak dekha hi kya he
 Not long ago when i asked in this column whether you had ever seen a leader who met his mask exactly as he does with Modi
 iskaa uddeshy us puraane vivaad par tanj kasnaa nahin tha jab govindacharya ne atal bihari vaajapeyi ko aisa mukhauta bataaya tha jo bijepi kii asaliyat ko chhipaane kaa kaam karata he
 My intention was to show that unlike Vajpayee, Modi is the true face of the RSS / BJP and does not pretend to be anything else
 modi ke maamle main maine kaha tha ki ve aapako jaise dikhte hai, ve vaise hi hai
 There is no hiding or hypocrisy in it
 ve aise hi hai or aage bhi apni pasand kii chizon ke maamle main aise hi rahenge, phir chaahe vah unki pasand ke kapade hon yaa unki apni fishan kii style
 It may be that the stitching of his name in the clothes seems a bit much, you can also give it the name of unnecessary ego or complacency
 aap unke chunaav or style kii aalochana ek fishan lekhak ke bataur karne ko swatantra hai, lekin is par aashcharya jataana moorkhtapurna hoga
 They have changed clothes several times a day and established a trend
 koi vishesh mauka ho yaa shikhar sammelan, to ve tamil film ke kisi gane ke drishy ko bhi kapade badalane ke maamle main maat de sakate hai
 He has displayed a ravishing display of colors of his choice, sometimes so bright colors that seem stranger in our simplistic political tradition depending on the suitability of the occasion
 yaad karen us neon red west kot ko jo unhone isro ke vaigyanikon ke saath mangalayan ke prakshepan kii kamyaabi kaa jashn manaate vakt bengalooru main pahana tha
 During the visit to Japan, there were discussions that he changed clothes within a day as many times as our ambassador did not change his saree during the entire journey
 yah thik bhi he kyonki rajdoot to ek saumy locasevak hota he or usase aisi ummid bhi nahin kii jaati he
 Modi sees himself as a leader
 ve khud ko aise brands ke rup main dekhte hai jo media ke liye bana he-tivi se lekar twitor tak, selfi se lekar fasebuk tak
 That is why they do not feel any difficulty in wrapping their brand in a garment that will make that brand more vibrant and displayable
 kya unke dimag main sirf itani-si baat rahi hogi ki unka namdhari dharidaar suut sirf brands modi ko hi rekhaankit karegaa?yah bhi to ho saktaa he ki is gujju kaaya ke bheetar ek pakkaa punjabi basataa ho, jaisaa ki hamane isi ank main ek duusare lekh main likhaa he
 If i have some emotion, i will show; If you have any problem then go and get your brain treated, but avoid doing my psychological analysis
 darasal, modi kii is kathith taur par anaavashyak, ahamkaari or aparipakv style ko lekar ho rahi charchaa par meri aapatti bhi kuch aisi hi he
 We know one thing that our leaders are never poor, but we want them to look poor
 apni raajnneeti main chaahe ve kitne hi swaarthee or nirashaavadi kyon na hon, chaahe kitna hi dhan ve apni kaalpanik swiss bank khaaton main bhare hon yaa phir apane real estate se jude mitron ke yahaan ioyu hundiyon ke rup main jamaa kar rakhe hon, lekin hamaari chahat hoti he ki ve silawatdaar khaadi main hi hamen dikhaai den
 i am not in favor of Modi's dress, but i mean by saying that we are doing the same foolish act as we would in a cheap psychology shower to impress others in drawing rooms and cocktail parties
 is
 aisi baaten ham tab to nahin karte jab ucch varg ke hamaare jaise log apni swayambhu style main vahiyaat pastel trouger yaa chote-chote kaale kapade pahanakar baahar nikalate hai or use apane phuli hui tond va bhadkeeli jaanghon ke neeche khinchne main jute rahete hai
 Do not talk about those strange Louis Vuitton bags which are so expensive but so bad that it is better to use the word khandi Hindustani, which cannot be printed here, starting with f instead of saying vitton
 yah shabd filmkaar vishaal bharadwaj ke munh se sunne main hi acha lagata he
 Let's draw this argument a little further
 aaie, ham sabhi un paanch sheersh rajnatik shakhsiyaton kii suchi banaaen jinke pahanaave or jivan-style ko ham bahut bura maanate hai
 Mayawati is always seen with her pearls and purse, then Ambedkar, often seen in a loose-fitting suit, then Balasaheb, who drinks white wine, and now Modi in his neon red vest and a suit with a stripe of his name
 ab achche paridhaan va jivan style vaale netaaon kii fehrist banaaie: silk or gahanon se ladi vasundhara raaje, inkulab or single malt se ishk karne vaale marhoom jyoti basu, kashmiri kapade or patech philip ghadiyaan pahanane vaale arun jetali, apane gucchi ke juuton, mon blank kii kalam or shandaar chhuttiyaan bitaane ke liye mashhoor rajeev gandhi, chhindwara main prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan harrds ke biscuit kaa dibba saath rakhe shuddh khaadi main lakadak kamalnath, or yahaan tak ki bengalooru ke sabase mahange korporate formon main se ek main rechankarm karte anna hajaare bhi, goyaa kisi gandhivadi ke liye vajan kam karne or rechan ke liye anshan paryaapt na ho; or ant main lohiavaadi jorge furnandis yaad aate hai jinaki lami kii kalam unki pahchaan hua karti thi
 You will see double hypocrisy in them
 koi shaks raajnneeti ke akaash par ubharta he, ham chaahate hai ki vahsaade pahanaave-odhaave main dikhe
 It does not matter to us whether he is wearing Lanvin's briefs inside or having hairdo biscuits in his car
 duusare, ham apane nishkarsh is baat se nikaalte hai ki ukt vyakti kii jaden kahaan hai
 a Nehru or Gandhi, born amidst prosperity, abandons his opulence and adopts Khadi and hence becomes an icon of humility and simplicity
 un logon kaa kya jinaki shuruyaat hi daridrata main hui he or ab jab ve kaamyaab ho gaye hai to sochate hai ki us hisaab se thodaa ji bhi liya jaae? yahi baat hamen bhadkaa detii he or ham kah uthte hai-ye kahaan se aa gaya!yahaan ek puraani film sagina main abhinayta dilip kumaar yaad aate hai jahaan pashchimi libaas pahane ek ganwai kii bhoomika main ve ek gane par naachte hai, ''saalaa main to sahab ban gaya
 
 
 Yeh suit mera dekho, this boot mera dekho, like Chhora koi london ka
 '' dilip kumaar ke gane kaa sandarbh len to maamla yah banataa he ki yadi koi ganwai apni langot main hi jeeta rahe to hamen khushi hogi or yadi koi suutawala apana suut chhodkar langot apana le to ham or zyada khush honge
 It is not a changing but a changed India
 gandhi, nehru, patel vagairah itani sampannataa main paidaa hue the ki aaj se sau saal pehle unke pariwaron ke paas unhen videsh padhane bhejne ke liye paryaapt paisa tha
 He developed his political style by discarding what he had inherited
 maujuuda loksabhaa main modi samet aise netaa bhare pade hai jo bilkul duusare parivesh se aae hai
 He did not bring anything to inheritance and now that he has tasted success, he has no hesitation in demonstrating his opulence
 ho saktaa he ki unki santatiyaan viraasat main mila aishwarya tyagkar hamen prabhavit karen
 i find myself the least qualified to comment on one's choice of dress, but in Modi's case i appreciate one thing that there is no hypocrisy within them
 main ek udhaaharan dekar ise samajhataa hum
 Take a look at the younger generation of AAP Congress leadership
 inamen se kai do jivan shaileyon ko ek saath jite hai
 Before ten in the night, they live in Khadi kurtas and then embroidered in silk's tight black T-shirts, sometimes even riding the expensive Ducati and harley-davidson
 mujhe yaad he ki ek baar main jorge furnandis se unke awaas par milane gaya tha or maine dekha ki ve apane istari kiye pajame main karine se silawat laga rahe the
 How could a socialist labor leader who is so humble, live so systematically? Of course it can stay
 yaad karen, tab unhen koi dikkat nahin hui thi jab siachin jate vakt emi-17 helicopter ke floor par sahyogi iees afasar jhukkar unke pairon main barf ke juute daal rahaa tha or feete baandh rahaa tha
 We can hope that such hypocrisy will not be seen by Modi, whatever may be our opinion on his choice and style
 vaise bhi, hamane unhen vinamrata ke liye nahin chunaa he
 We loved his 56-inch chested ovation, his Gujarat success and exaggerated rhetoric about the work done there
 modi ke bare main sabase ahm baat yah he ki ve jaise hai vaise hi dikhte hai
 On the intellectual, political, ideological and philosophical level, he stands behind Jawaharlal Nehru
 aap chahen to yah parakhane ke liye ek aajamaaish kar sakate hai
 Move to an outlet in Fabindia or Khadi Bhavan in your city, where for decades our liberal community has been buying handloom kurtas and 'jawahar' jackets
 vahaan kuch der tak ruke rahiye, aapako kisi na kisi graahak kii aawaaj jarur sunai degi jo 'modi' jacket kii maang kar rahaa hoga
 You will find that it is the same jacket
 modi ne kam se kam ek kaam jarur kiya he
 He has overtaken Jawaharlal Nehru in terms of dress
 kendriya mantri or bhaajapa netaa uma bharti ne ram mandir mudde ko lekar ek bada bayaan diya he
 Uma Bharti said that the Bharatiya Janata Party does not have a patent on the Ram temple
 iske saath hi unhone ram mandir ko lekar shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare kii koshishon kii tarif bhi kii
 Uma Bharti said, 'I appreciate the effort of Uddhav Thackeray
 ram mandir par bhaajapa kaa patent nahin he, bhagwaan ram sabake hai
 i appeal to people like SP, BSP, Akali Dal, Owaisi and Azam Khan to come forward to build Ram temple
 ' The match, to be held on 16 June in Manchester, remains in the limelight with fans demanding a boycott of the match between India and Pakistan in the Cricket World Cup
 old traverd main 25000 darshakon kii kshamta ke baavjood tikaton ke liye 4 xxrep 5 0 se adhik logon ne aavedan kiya he
 Top Indian cricketers like Harbhajan Singh have called for a boycott of the round robin match against Pakistan, while a veteran like Chetan Chauhan wants India to pressurize the ICC by threatening a boycott of the entire tournament
 isisi vishwa cap ke toornament nideshak steve elvarthi ne landan main prachaar kaarykram ke dauraan bataaya ki bharat or pakistan ke bich group charan main hone vaale match ke tikaton kii maang england or australia ke bich hone vaale match or lords main hone vaale final se bhi adhik he
 ESPN Cricinfo quoted Elworthy as saying, 'the number of applicants for tickets for this match (india vs Pakistan) is more than 4 xxrep 5 0 , which is a very large number
 stadium main sirf 25000 darshak aa sakate hai
 So many people will be disappointed
 ’elvarthi ne bataaya ki england or australia ke bich hone vaale mukaable ke liye 23 xxrep 4 0 se 24 xxrep 4 0 logon ne aavedan kiya he, jabaki final ke liye aavedan karne waalon kii sankhya 26 xxrep 4 0 se 27 xxrep 4 0 ke bich he
 After the shock of demonetisation in the country, the common man has received another setback for currency communication
 is jatke main jahaan 6 se 7 rajyon main atm khaali ho gaye or deshbhar main atm se cash nikaalane kii hode lag gai vahiin ek baar phir vitt mantralay or rigerv bank ke bayanon se aapasi talmail kii jhalak dikhne lagi
 As soon as the social media started trending on the keywords of currency crunch on Wednesday, the matter started cleaning up on several levels, including Finance Ministry, Reserve Bank, Government Bank and Economic Advisers
 centre sarkaar kii taraf se pehle vitt mantralay se safai di gai ki karency kaa koi sankat nahin he
 But in the areas where this crisis is being claimed, relief work is being done as soon as possible

 In the wake of this crisis, the Central Reserve Bank announced that it has set up an inter-state committee which will look into the movement of currency from states with high cash to the cash-strapped states
 ise padhein: cashles nahin hui iconomi, chapai band hone se bigadaa cash kaa khelis conference ke saapeksh vitt mantri arun jetali ne twit karte hue jaankaree di ki puure desh main karency kaa koi sankat nahin he

 61 varshiya amritanandmayi par lag rahe aarope gambhir hai
 In her book Holly Hell: a Memoir of Faith, Devotion and Pure Madness, Gail Treadwell aka Gayatri wrote that she was raped several times by an influential member of Mata Amritanandamayi Math (MAM)
 tradewell ne khud ko brahmacharee kehane vaali amritanandmayi par aarope lagaate hue kaha he ki ve khud yon kunthit hai or unamem shaareerik hinsa ke bhi lakshan hai
 These allegations may shock those who know that Amritanandamayi has been awarded the Gandhi King Award by the United Nations in 2007
 ek aisa sammaan jisase isse pehle swargeey nelson mandela or sanyukt raashtra ke purv sachiv kophi annan ko hi nawaja gaya he
 Treadwell was one of Amrita's early disciples and was also a personal assistant to Amritanandamayi from 1981 to 1999
 lagbhag 229 pannon kii is kitaab main ashram main faili araajaktaa or yon shoshan kii ghatnaon kaa vistaarpurvak zikr karne ke saath-saath ashram main rahane vaali shishyaaon ke maansik or shaareerik utpeeda kaa bhi vivaran diya gaya he
 Treadwell alleges that Amritanandayi Math is also involved in financial messes, due to which his ashram, once run in a small hut in Kollam, Kerala, has been transformed into a network of thousands of colleges, schools and hospitals
 aaj jabaki amritanandmayi ke bhakt soshal media par tradewell kii kitaab ke i-sanskaran ke viral hone ke baad digital ladaai main jute hue hai to vahiin kerala police un net yugers kaa pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahi he jinhone is kitaab ko downlod or share kiya
 On 24 February, Champat Rai, international general secretary of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), demanded an inquiry into Treadwell's allegations, saying, "no one should incite Hindu society
" ” ashram ke jin varisht sadasyon ko tradewell ne aaropon ke ghere main liya he, ve kitaab main lagaae gaye aaropon ko bakawaas bataate hai
 Amrita Swaroopanand, considered closest to the ashram's Amritanandamayi, told India Today, "treadwell's allegations and his language are so vulgar and barbaric that it cannot be answered
" main in pavitra paridhaanon ko pahanakar us str tak nahin ja saktaa
 Brahmachari Raju, public relations officer of Amritanandamayi, says he is preparing to file a defamation suit against Treadwell after talking to an attorney in New York
 unhone kaha, ''unhone ashram main 20 saal tak rahane ke dauraan in aaropon ko nahin uthaaya or na hi ashram chhodie ke 14 saal baad tak
 "all the allegations are the birth of his unstable mind
" ve cancer kii rogi hai or depressant kii shikaar rahati hai
 (gail Treadwell with Mata Amritanandamayi) Some people at the ashram claim that Treadwell has been irritated ever since Amritanandamayi objected to his disciple's desire to marry a New York millionaire devotee
 ek bhakt bataate hai, ''gayatri ne ek bhakt ke saath prem kii pingen bharne kii koshish kii thi
 But she complained to Ammi about it
 is par ammaa ne gayatri ko aisa karne se manaa kiya
 "the Kerala Police has sought legal advice to register a rape case based on the allegation of Treadwell's book
 police ko tradewell se sampark karne or aaropon ko sunishchit karne ke baad shuruaati str kii jaanch karne ko bhi kaha gaya he
 Deepak Prakash, a lawyer for the Supreme Court in Delhi, has also lodged a complaint at the police station near the headquarters of the ashram in Kollam, but the police have asked Deepak to produce evidence to pursue the case

" ” jabaki grih mantri ramesh chennithala kehete hai ki emeem par avishvaas karne kii koi vajah nahin he
 However, the CPM has reacted to the matter
 iske rajya sachiv pinarai vijayan ne kaha he, ''aarope gambhir hai or inaki thik se jaanch honi chahie
 "BJP and VHP have directly come out in support of Amritanandamayi
 bijepi ke rashtriya sachiv pi
 K
 krishnadas kehete hai, ''yah kitaab hindu netaaon or hindu sansthaaon ko badnaam karne ke antarrashtriya agenda kaa hissaa he
 ”director of the Indian Think Center P
 parameshwaran kehete hai, ''taaja aaropon main amritanandmayi par nishaanaa saadhaa gaya he kyonki khud amritanandmayi or math aadhyatmikta or seva kaa sabase bada pratik ban gaya he
 "the Ashram has issued some e-mails to justify its protest
 ashram kaa daawa he ki ye i-mail unheen chaar videshi shishyon ne likhe hai jo tradewell ko acchhee tarah jaanate hai
 They mocked Treadwell's accusations and in turn accused Treadwell of having a sexual orientation
 haalanki tradewell is baat se bilkul bhi pareshaan nahin hai
 He told India Today, "I stand by what i have said in my book, i have no intention of backing down from anything
" maine bagaiyr kisi buree bhaavana ke sach bataa diya he or isi vajah se unke paas mere khilaaf koi sahi maamla nahin he
 On the prospect of Ashram filing a lawsuit against him, Treadwell said, "any defamation lawsuit will upset me financially because of expensive legal action, but taking the matter to court will attract media attention and it will make the ashram Only negative image of will be prepared
 ” india today ko likhe gaye i-mail main unhone kaha he ki ve is baat se bahut pareshaan hai ki police kii shakti kaa istemaal bahut si awaajon or abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ko dabaane ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 He said it took him 14 years to come forward with the allegations as it took a long time to recover from the behavior at the ashram
 tradewell ne yah bhi kaha ki shuruyaat main ve sab bhul janaa chaahati thim or unhen yah bhi dar tha ki sab kuch saarvajanik karne par unhen nuksaan bhi pahunchaaya ja saktaa he
 Amritanandamayi is unaware of these allegations
 ve kahati hai, ''ye aarope mujhe chhu bhi nahin sakate
 She was with me in the ashram for many years, but during her stay in the ashram, she did not tell me everything that she has written in the book
 ” unhone india today ko bataaya, ''mujhe lagata he ki use gumraah kiya gaya he
 Her claim that she stayed in my room is completely false
 ve upar ke kamare main rahati thim
 He got permission to leave the ashram because some of his works were indecent as a monk
 ”amritanandmayi ne 22 farvari ko kerala ke palakkad main apane shishyon ko sambodhit karte hue vittiya gadbaditon main shaamil hone ke kisi bhi aarope se inkaar kiya
 He said, "if we have lakhs of crores of rupees as he says

 However, the monastery is not so poor

 saadhaaran mej or saamne lagi kursiyon par baithe chaar log netaa se milane kii baari kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 This view is for the reception of Delhi's ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) office in Patel Nagar
 kursi par baitha adhed umr kaa ek party kaaryakarta jeb se ek parchaa nikaalata he, jisamen asangathit kshetra ke mazdooron kii sthiti or uske liye rojgaar mela lagane kaa zikr he
 His voice suddenly gets sharper while showing the paper, "we have given 1031 toll free numbers against corruption, now Delhi Police is issuing 1064 numbers
 pehle kyon nahin khyaal aayaa? ham sikhayenge tumhen raajnneeti
 
 
 As a human being, if we work, we will also be at fault, but we will not do anything on purpose
 ” talkh andaaj or farrotedaar lahaze main vah shaks chand minuton main tamaam mudde gina detaa he jisko lekar dilli sarkaar or centre ke bich vivaad sadakon par aa chukaa he
 This attitude of the AAP workers is a glimpse of the changed strategy of the party, where it is not revolution but seeking sympathy of the people showing themselves as victims
 aap ke sheersh ranneetikaron main shaamil ek netaa kehete hai, “49 din vaali hamaari sarkaar kranti se prerit thi, is baar vyaavhaarik sarkaar he
 "you are working on a very rigorous strategy
 kaam bhale na ho, lekin vah un tamaam muddon par kaam karte hue dikhnaa chaahati he, jo bhale uske adhikaar kshetra main nahin aate hon
 For example, in the last six months, Delhi's Arvind Kejriwal government has convened two special sessions of the Legislative Assembly, rejecting the Union Home Ministry's notifications regarding the state government's rights and another on the proposal for the formation of a Women's Investigation Commission
 party kii ranneeti main sabase bada badlaav janalokapal bill ko lekar aayaa he, jis mudde par kejariwal ne 49 din ke baad hi sarkaar se istipha de diya tha
 But taking lessons from the mistakes of the last time, you have made Janlokpal out of your priority this time
 aap ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, “is baar janalokapal bill ko lekar ham jaldbaaji main nahin hai
 We have understood that the norms of the people are different, we are doing all the work that is necessary in the eyes of the people first
 ”darasal aap kii ranneeti vivadaspad muddon ke takneekee pahaluon main janata ko uljhaana nahin he
 Hence the party's communication strategy is limited to "do what the public understands"
 party ke ek varisht ranneetikaar kii daleel he ki aap kii safalataa kaa yahi raaj he
 Taking this strategy forward, the party is using posters and other means of publicity
 party apni prachaar kii ranneeti kii har saptaah samiksha karti he or jarurat padane par kisi nakaaratmak prachaar saamagree ko waapas lene main hichak nahin dikhaati
 On the confrontation with the Center, AAP national spokesperson Ashutosh tells India Today, "AAP government is not being allowed to work deliberately on behalf of Prime Minister Modi
 unhen dar lag rahaa he ki dilli main jo hamaara jaadu chalaa he, vahi jaadu punjab or anya rajyon main bhi chalaa to bijepi kii haalat kharaab ho jaaegi
 "he says that apart from the police and land, the central government is not allowing the state government to work on its own in service or transfer-posting
 lekin dilli vidhansabha main duusari baar chune gaye bijepi vidhayak om prakaash sharma is maamle main kehete hai, “aam aadmi party jhooth bolne kii mashin ban gai he
 98% of the officers and employees in Delhi are directly appointed by the Delhi Government
 kareeb do fisadi aise adhikari hai jo prashasnic seva main hai jo centre sarkaar ke adheen hai or unki tainaati dilli ke alaava andaman, daman-div jaise kai anya centre shasit pradeshon main bhi hoti he
 So why does Kejriwal want the key to other states? ”though some other AAP leaders believe that the Delhi Police and the state government can never get the right to land
 lekin uski ranneeti ise uchhaalate rahane kii he taaki kanoon-vyavastha ko lekar rajya sarkaar katghare main khadi na ho
 So have you now understood the practicality of politics, which is considered immature because of leaving the 49-day government? Former law minister Jitendra Singh Tomar's resignation in the case of mutual discord between AAP and fake degrees, serious allegations against mlas have raised questions over the credibility of Kejriwal government
 iske alaava vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv banane ko lekar bhi aap kii alag raajnneeti ke siddhanton par sawaal uth rahe hai
 But AAP leaders do not hesitate to admit that it has been a mistake in some cases
 vipaksh kii najar main sansadeey sachivon kii badi fouj taiyaar karne kii vajah bhale tushtikaran ho, lekin aap kii ranneeti raajnneeti kii nai paudh ko agali peedi ke liye taiyaar karne kii he
 But you do not want to be obsessed in this politics of confrontation
 uskaa focus sheersh stareey kareeb aadha darjan netaaon kii chhavi par he
 One of the leaders of AAP says, "the more the central government attacks us, the more we will benefit if there is no big mistake and no one is accused of corruption
 ” lekin aap kii badali hui dasha-disha par jawahar laal nehru vivi ke professor si
 P
 bhambari kehete hai, “aap bhi anya partiyon kii tarah dikh rahi he, jiskaa makasad chunaav ladanaa or sarkaar bananaa maatr hota he
 After defeating the BJP, they should have understood that Modi government will disturb
 lekin kejariwal pehle din se takaraav kii niti par chal pade, jabaki unhen apni simaaon main kaam karke dikhaanaa chahie tha
 If you think that people are in favor of this politics, then perhaps they are forgetting that BJP also got 30 percent votes in the election
 ”aap ne jis tarah se bihar chunaav main nitish kumaar ko paroksh samarthan diya he usase saaf he ki kejariwal kii najar congress ke simtane kii vajah se khaali hui vipaksh kii jagah ko bharne kii he, jiske liye ve lagaataar gaiyr congress-gaiyr bijepi dal shasit rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon se sampark banaae hue hai
 In Bihar elections too, Kejriwal's strategy is to attack Narendra Modi directly instead of appealing for Nitish
 bihar ke baad kejariwal sabase bada daav punjab main khelenge or dilli kii tarah hi vahaan aap kaa paracham laharaaya to raajnneeti main rashtriya str par khadey hone ke kejariwal ke mansoobey ko pankh lag jaaenge
 Although people are looking at you from the perspective of revolution and change, but now with the practicality of power, the party is seeing a national advantage in the politics of confrontation

 Associate Editor es
 30-year-old Sushil Kumar, the only player from India to win two individual Olympic medals in a Guptagu with Vivek and Yogeshwar Dutt, 31, a London 2012 bronze medalist, spoke about friendship, sacrifice and success
 aap donon is baat ke liye mashhoor hai ki aap ek hi sikke ke do pahaluon kii tarah hai
 After all, how old is your friend? Sushil Kumar (stressing his mind) 1995? Yogeshwar Dattan
 
 
 nahin, 1997
 This year our friendship will be 16 years
 itane samay se ham saath hai
 Sushilasach dude, i don't remember it at all
 ham chote-chote bachche the
 We are not brothers, but by no means are we any less than real brothers
 ek-duusare kii kamyaabiyon or naakaamiyon ko hamane ek saath dekha or unase paar paaya he
 We are deeper friends than Jai and Veeru
 phir to ek saath bade hone or saath-saath bhidnt kii tamaam pyaari yaaden bhi to hongi aap donon ke paas?sushilkya-kya nahin kiya ham donon ne saath milakar
 All kinds of pranks
 kushti ke liye jane kitni baar local bason main baithkar rohtak kaa safar kiya he
 One time during a tournament in America, i gasped and told Yogeshwar, "brother, today i will probably die
" ’’ is par isane kaha, ‘‘jab tak main hum naa, kuch nahin hoga
 "he said that he would not let me deal so easily
" is bande ne mujhako hameshaa apane se aage rakhaa he
 Yogeshwar has always stayed in the same room and won medals simultaneously in tournaments
 or to or, hamaari aadaten bhi ek jaisi hai
 You can say that we are a carbon copy of each other
 ek hi sikke ke do pahalu
 The 2008 Beijing Olympics was an exception where Sushil won but i could not
 lekin landan main phir se gaadi dharre par aa gai
 Everyone was expected to win a medal from Yogeshwar in Beijing
 magar padak jeeta susheel ne
 Ask Sushilasuch, i was deeply sorry for this
 yogeshwar achche pool main tha magar kismat hi kharaab thi
 When i met him, he was very happy at my success and i also liked that, at least, this thing gave him pleasure
 yogeshwarahaan, main khud se to niraash tha magar susheel ke jeetne kii mujhe khushi thi
 His medal changed India's perspective of seeing wrestling as a sport and especially for wrestlers
 usne pahalawaanon kii puri birdari ke liye sammaan arjeet kiya
 He single-handedly changed the face of the game
 sushiliskaa sara shrey main akele nahin le saktaa
 For me, many people have been working behind the scenes
 magar main maanata hum ki beijing ke baad kaaphi kuch badla he
 And in London where we both won one medal each, wrestling took a completely different place in the minds of Indian people
 ab hamaare paas videshon main toornament jeetne vaale kai naam hai or ve apane-apane category main awwal hai
 Often people say that if there is a wrestler, the mind will be less
 ’’ is tarah ke tanj par aapaki kya pratikriya hoti he?sushinji, kushti main takat ke mukaable dimag zyada chahie hota he
 You have to make quick decisions
 aapako dimag lagaana hota he ki saamne vaale ke dimag main kya chal rahaa he, uskaa vishleshan kar use naakaam karnaa hota he or apane hamale kii yojana banani hoti he
 Another myth associated with wrestlers is that they eat too much
 isamen kitni sachaai he?yogeshwarabhai, pahalwaan ek santulit khuraaq lete hai
 Just
 ham donon hi shaakaahaari hai
 We eat healthy and we always have to maintain the balance of our weight
 ham niyamit antaraal par baadaam, doodh, salad or dahi lete rahete hai
 We have not heard about the use of technology in wrestling
 aap log ranneetiyaan kaise taiyaar karte hai?yogeshwar sushilmere think tanks hai
 We discuss a lot before and during every tournament
 ham taal thokane vaale lagbhag sabhi logon ko, unke majboot or kamjor pahaluon ko jaanate hai
 Have any of you heard about Manish Wrestler? Yogeshwar Kaun Manish? (laughs) Sushil i know him
 yogeshwaramera hi naam he manish
 People in my village and in the arena also know me by this name
 skool main daakhila lete vakt meraa naam yogeshwar likhaa diya gaya
 In this way, i am only Yogeshwar for the outside world, for those who have known me after becoming a national wrestler
 landan ke baad har koi rio main aap donon se swarna padak se kam kii ummid nahin kar rahaa
 How are you able to maintain your focus by moving along with such expectations? Sushil hopes that will increase, it is very simple
 main usee tarah taiyaari main yakeen karata hum jaise koi chaatr kisi pratiyogi pariksha ke liye karata he
 The Olympics is a similar test
 mujhe puraa bharosa he ki bharat ke pahalwaan rio main kam se kam teen padak jarur jeetenge
 Thankfully our coaches have always maintained us on the ground
 shoharat ke shor main bah janaa khiladinnon kii pravriti hoti he lekin apane aas-paas achche logon kii maujuudagi or unase baat karte rahane se kaaphi madad milti he
 Talking outside the realm of wrestling, what is one such quality of each other that you are interested in? Sushilayogeshwarbade is of a helpful nature
 aisa sirf mere liye hi nahin he
 If he asks for any help, he always goes ahead and helps him
 iske alaava vah hameshaa seekhney ke liye taiyaar rahata he
 He tries to learn from the youngest and most inexperienced wrestlers without any kind of gurur
 yogeshwar sushilbahut hi mazaakia swabhaav kaa he
 With his jokes he can make anyone laugh
 haalanki aapke saamne, kam se kam record par (hansate hue) main uske chutkule aapako nahin suna saktaa
 i think i would have been half of it in this case, if anything would have happened
 vah bolta bhi acha he
 Instead of stuttering here and there, he can talk in a serious way which is very good

 Speaking to the media, Mishra said that Arvind Kejriwal is trying to hide in three curtains instead of answering questions
 ye teen bahaane bana rahe hai ki main bijepi kaa agent hum, main kumaar vishwaas ke saath hum, maine pehle kyun nahin kiya
 Mother's letter to Arvind ji: - priy arvind, i am writing this first and last letter to you
 meraa betaa tumhaare se sawaal poochhega or tum sawaalon se bachoge aisa kabhi nahin sochaa tha
 When you have met me you always talked about transparency in public life
 har cheez ko janata ke saamne rakhane kii baat kii
 Today you are accusing my son of being an agent of BJP, spreading false pictures on social media to your closest companions
 kal shaam ko AAP ke zyaadaatar varisht netaaon ne soshal media par jo tasviir failaai us kaarykram main to tum bhi the
 You had the whole cabinet
 kumaar vishwaas ke pitaaji ke sammaan main wo kaarykram tha
 How much lies Arvind, how much ?? yaad he jab tum mere ghar aae the ki kapil ko party main lenaa chahta hum, chunaav ladvana he kapil maan nahin rahaa
 He only wanted to agitate, then you came to me i need Kapil
 aaj tumhaare log mujhe bhi bhrashtachari kah rahe hai
 You are silent dilli kii sabase pehali mohalla sabha maine lagaai thi
 in 2007
 tum bhi to aae the us mohalla sabha main, tumhaare saare saathi aae the
 At that time there was no movement or party names
 kapil us mohalla sabha ko sanchalit kar rahaa tha
 In your own book, Swaraj, you have written ways of doing my work
 aaj kahaan se kahaan aa gaye ho tum
 You told me that when 28 AAP mlas won, they were first shown the VIDEO of my own Mohalla Sabha at the Constitution Club
 arvind, tumne kapil ke saath kaam to kiya he par shaayad use pahachaanaa nahin
 She is very stubborn

 Chris Gayle, former captain of the West Indies cricket team, was refused 'buy' by the Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise teams in the January auction but Gayle, who returned to the IPL-4 as a replacement, conceded a century that the franchise How wrong the teams were judged
 rochak baat yah he ki 10 janvari ko jab ipel ke maujuuda satr ke liye bengaluru main nilaamee chal rahi thi or gail ke saath-saath bhartiya team ke purv captain saurav ganguli ko koi kharidaar nahin mil rahaa tha, tab gail austrailia main big bash toornament main 137 ranon kii tufaani pari khel rahe the
 It is also a strange coincidence that the Kolkata Knight Riders, who captained Gayle in the second edition of the IPL, refused to adopt him for the fourth edition
 nite rides kii kismat dekhie ki gail ne shuukravaar ko royal chalangers bangalore ke liye eden gardens main khelte hue usee ke khilaaf shandaar shatak lagaaya or lay se bhatki apni team ke hero bane
 While returning to the pavilion after the match, the joy of this great performance can be clearly seen on Gayle's face
 apane saathiyon se haath milaate vakt unhone kaha, "whot e debyue (kitni acchhee shuruyaat he
 "gayle's name is not new to the IPL but the manner in which Gayle made a comeback to the IPL after being sidelined can only be considered a debut
 darasal, gail jis kad or style ke khilaadi hai, use dekhte hue unhen cricket ke kisi bhi swaroop ke liye nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Apart from Gayle, Brendon mccullum of New Zealand, India's Virender Sehwag and Yusuf Pathan, Pakistan's Shahid Afridi, South Africa's Abraham De Villiers and Australia's Adam Gilchrist have been established match-winning players and ignoring such players would be termed as a bad decision
 ipel main afridi nahin khel rahe hai
 Apart from them, mccallum, Pathan, Sehwag, de Villiers and Gilchrist got the honored buyers but none of the teams bothered to associate Gayle with them
 iske baad gail ko westeindies kii rashtriya team se baahar kar diya gaya
 All teams found their base price to be $ 400,000 higher
 westeindies cricket board kaa kendriya qaraar nakaarne vaale gail ke paas big-bash yaa phir ipel jaise kisi aayojan main lautne ke alaava or koi chaara nahin tha
 Vijay Mallya, the owner of Royal Challengers who joined Gayle as a replacement for Australian fast bowler Dirk Nance, proved why he is such a successful businessman
 khud maalya ne bhi gail ko janvari main apnaane se inkaar kar diya tha lekin jaise-jaise vakt beetaa or carabian cricket ke kendriya qaraar kaa rasta saaf hua, maalya ko laga ki gail ko team main rakhana upyogi sabit ho saktaa he kyonki un par srilankai khilaadiyon kii tarah swadesh lautne kaa koi dabaav nahin hoga
 He can play for his team with full dedication
 isi bich nains kii peeth main takalif hui or team prabandhan ne bina deree kiye gail ko team main shaamil karne kii maang kii
 For this he had to spend an amount equal to that of Nance
 nains ko royal chalangers ne 200,000 dollar main apane saath joda tha
 Gayle was also included in the team for the same amount
 gail ko bhale hi apni aadhaar keemat se aadhi keemat par ipel-4 main khilne kaa mauka mila lekin twanti-20 vishwa cap ke itihaas main pehla shatak lagane vaale is dhurandhar ballebaaj ne jis str kaa pradarshan kiya he, usase aane vaale vakt main unke liye frenchiji tiimon ke bich oonchi se oonchi keemat lagane kii hode lagegi

 maidan-e-jang main tabdeel mosul ke andar se aisi-aisi tasviren or kahaniyaan nikaal kar baahar aa rahi hai ki bas puuchhie mat
 Somewhere there are tons of weapons and hundreds of thousands of bombs
 par maidan-e-jang kii un tasveeron ko aapako dikhaaen usase pehle ek duusari tasviir dikhaate hai
 Picture of ISIS terrorist carrying a truck full of bombs and flew to the fairy Kurdish army
 lekin kurdish fiteron ne vakt rahete iesas ke ek khaufnak fidaayin hamale ko naakaam kar diya
 Otherwise, anything could have happened
 ye tasviren kurdish fiteron ke aise hi ek kheme main shoot kii gayi
 Here these Kurdish fighters were sometimes targeting enemies with tank mounted missiles, sometimes they were trying to maim them with bullets
 lekin isi bich in fiteron ko dur se apni taraf ek aisi shay aati hui nazar aati he ki puure kheme main khalabali much jaati he

 Therefore, the Kurdish fighter also wants to get this mini truck matted before it reaches him

 But since the speed of the truck is very fast, it is difficult to aim at it exactly from any point of view
 magar, is koshish main agle hi pal jo kuch hota he, usase fauziyon ke is kheme main khushi lahar daud jaati he
 a rocket seems to be in the middle of this mini truck running at full speed

 purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ek aisi raajnneetik parampara se taalluk rakhte the, jisamen raajnneetik virodhiyon ke liye sammaan or maanviya maryaada kaa vishesh sthaan sthaan rahaa karata tha
 One such touching incident happened in the life of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, which he himself told
 atalji ko shradhanjali dene ke liye yahaan clic karembat saal 1991 kii he jab purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi kii hatya ho chuki thi
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the bjp's tallest leader, was the Leader of Opposition in Parliament at that time
 tab ek varisht patrkaar ne vaajapeyi se rajeev gandhi ke bare main unki raay janani chaahi
 So Vajpayee narrated an anecdote of his life in a very emotional way and said that if he (atal Bihari Vajpayee) is alive today then because of Rajiv Gandhi
 darasal baat 1984-1989 ke daur kii he jab rajeev gandhi desh ke pradhanmantri the or atal bihari vaajapeyi kidney sambandhi beemaari se jujh rahe the
 At that time, the best medical system for this disease was not available in India
 jisaki vajah se vaajapeyi ko ilaaj ke liye america janaa padataa, lekin aarthik vajahon se vaajapeyi america ja paane main sakasham nahin the
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee said in an emotional way that somehow Rajiv Gandhi came to know that he is suffering from kidney disease and he needs to be treated abroad
 vaajapeyi ne kaha ki ek din rajeev gandhi ne unhen apane daftar main bulaayaa or kaha ki unhen bharat kii taraf se ek pratinidhimandal ke saath sanyukt raashtra bheja ja rahaa he
 Rajiv Gandhi told Vajpayee that he hoped to take advantage of this opportunity and get his treatment done in New York
 vaajapeyi ne kaha ki ve neuyork gaye or isi vajah se aaj jinda hai
 Neither Rajiv Gandhi nor Vajpayee shared this incident after returning from New York
 donon shakhsiyaton ne saarvajanik jivan main ek duusare ke virdohi kii bhoomika nibhaai
 However, after some time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee sent a message through a postcard and thanked Rajiv Gandhi for this courtesy
 lekin rajeev ke jite ji atal ji ne yah vakya kisi or se saajha nahin kiya
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Rajiv Gandhi are not part of today's politics, nor is it the era today
 apane virodhiyon ke liye is tarah kaa vandhutav aaj ke daur kii nishthur raajnneeti main durlabh hi he

 Sharad Yadav said that it is unexpected that 7 military personnel, including two officials of the rank of Major, were killed in the terrorist attack on the army camp at Nagrota near Jammu on Tuesday, but they were not paid tribute in the House
 sharad yadav ne notebandi se paidaa hue halaat ke chalate 'kareeb 90 logon' kii jaan jane kaa bhi ullekh kiya
 Also, the government says that it has done demonetisation in the interest of the country
 isi par jetali ne sharad yadav se kaha ki pehle ve apni party main notebandi ke mudde par baat karen or tay karen ki 500 or 1000 rupee ke noton par bain ke paksh main hai yaa vipaksh main
 Jaitley's reference was to JD-U chief and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who has issued a statement in support of demonetisation
 yadav ne palatwaar karte hue kaha, 'hamanotbandike khilaaf nahin hai
 We are against restrictions such as not getting money withdrawn from our own accounts
 ' phir yadav ne jetali se kaha ki kya aapke pradhanmantri aapke saath hai? kya wo aapaki sunate hai?kuch din pehle samaajawaadee party ke sadsy naresh agarwal ne rajyasabha main notebandi par bahes main hissaa lete hue kaha tha ki is faisle ke bare main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne shaayad vitt mantri arun jetali ko bhi nahin bataaya, nahin to wo mere kaan main jarur fusfusa dete
