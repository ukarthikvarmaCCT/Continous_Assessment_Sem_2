 Alam is that Kejriwal has almost stopped communication with the police
 shaayad isliye jab guuruuvaar vah apane mantriyon ke saath press ke saamne police ko lataadne pahunche, to aaj tak ke yah poochne par ki vah sidhe police kamishnar se baat kyon nahin karte, kejariwal ne sire se jhooth bolaa

 aise main sawaal yah he ki kya police kamishnar kii chuttee sirf siem ke liye he
 However, when the attempt was made to seek the opinion of the Commissioner on CM Kejriwal's statement, he was cut off
 bassi ne kaha ki unhen aise kisi bayaan kii jaankaree nahin he or unhone tivi nahin dekha he
 The CM and Commissioner of Delhi may be talking separately on this matter, but one thing is clear from this whole incident that the necessary dialogue between Kejriwal and Bassi is also completely closed these days
 vahiin, kejariwal ne aaj jis tarah se jhooth bolaa he usase 'aap' netaa vinod kumaar binni ke us bayaan ko bhi bal miltaa he ki kejariwal ab jhooth bolne lage hai

 peedit ladki ne yah aarope baqayada press-conference main lagaaya

 For a year, he persecuted mentally and physically
 "peedit ne daawa ki "swami ke khilaaf aarope kaa mere paas saboot bhi he
 Keep my hostel room safe
 vakt aane par main swami ke khilaaf sabhi majboot saboot police ko saunp duungi
 "the victim's question was that if the UP police is honest then why did she have to file a rape complaint against (victim) Swami Chinmayananda in Delhi? If the UP police is cooperating, then two days later the SIT complained against Swamy But why have not filed a case of rape? The law student said, "my family and family are being threatened by the District Magistrate of Shahjahanpur
 kyonki unhone chinmayanand ke khilaaf shikaayat kii he
 "the girl said that if she opens her hostel room, then the investigating agency will get a lot of evidence against Swamy there

 If someone says that the office environment is not good, then no one tells his boss good

 The more people, the more problems
 bahut kam aise log hote hai jinhen apane offis or kaam se shikaayat nahin hoti he
 People who talk negatively about their office and work always remain enemies for their careers
 aapako bataa den ki promoshan or acha aprejal unheen kaa hota he jo apane kaam or bos se khush rahete hai
 Know why it is important to be happy in office: 1
 jab aap khush rahete hai tabhi kisi bhi project par apana dhyaan kendrit kar pate hai
 Many research proves that people who are happy do more work and also take special care of quality
 yah unke andar aatmavishvaas or motiveshan, donon paidaa karata he
 2
 khush rahane vaale log hameshapositive atitudeke saath rahete hai
 Those who remain unhappy most of the time think that this project will not be able to do with them
 iskaa asar unke growth par bhi padataa he
 Many times, the candidates with negative attitude also lose their jobs
 positive rahane vaala vyavhaar khud ke liye or company donon ke liye hi acha hota he
 3
 relax rahanaa jitna jaruri hamaari jindagi ke liye he, utana hi jaruri naukari ke liye bhi he
 Many times in the office you have idiaderjects
 ho saktaa he ki aapane koi acha kaam kiya ho or uski credit kisi or ko mil gaya ho
 Still it is necessary to control yourself
 4
 Those who are happy, neither are afraid to give advice or not to take it
 kisi bhi kaam main wo aasaani se dusron kaa sahyog kar bhi dete hai or samay par dusron se madad bhi lete hai
 At the same time, people who are happy in the office easily become mentors of their juniors
 5
 If you start accepting new opportunities and challenges, then you also want to see yourself at the top
 lekin jab aap kaam se bhaagenge, negative atitude rakhenge to dhire-dhire aapaki creativity bhi khatm hone lagegi

 Many creepy havelis and fort parts have been heard till now
 aisi koi bhi haveli yaa kila nahin tha, jahaan koi rahata ho, isliye daastaan kitni sach he, kitni jhooth, ye shaq hameshaa bana rahata tha
 But 'she' lives in this fort and lives with the sound of her curls

 The 'one', who has been dead for 1500 years
 kabhi kisi mahal jaisaa rahaa shandaar kila aaj khandhar main tabdeel ho gaya he
 But the life here seems alive even with the tenants here
 yahaan ke viraane aaj bhi kisi ke jinda hone kaa ahsaas karaate hai or jab din thakkar so jaataa he, to yahaan raat kii tanhaai aksar ghunghruon kii chhanakati awaajon se tut jaati he
 This fort of Kalinjar has many mysterious tilism of Kali caves
 raat hote hi in gufaaon main ek ajeeb halchal hoti he
 During the day, this fort looks as silent as it is, and at night it is as dreadful
 kile kii 800 foot kii oonchai par pani kii dhar neeche se upar kii ore bahati he
 The fort of Kalinjar is built on the hills 800 feet high from the ground in Banda
 kalinger durg ko kisi ne chamatkaar kaha to kisi ne anokhaa tilsim qaraar diya
 This was the only reason that the step also moved towards the uncharted hill
 kalinger kile main daakhil hote hi kai rahasyamayi choti badi gufaaen dikhaai deen
 The caves which are facing, but the end is not known
 yani gufaaen shuru to hoti hai, lekin khatm kahaan jaakar hoti hai, yah koi nahin jaanata
 In the caves, spider webs and ghoulish cats stare at the place, but in spite of all this, the steps proceeded silently towards the cave
 in andheri gufaaon ke bich ye tap tap girtaa pani hamaare jism main siharan paidaa kar rahaa tha
 As our steps were moving inward into the cave, the thrill was increasing even more
 in andheri gufaaon main chamagaadadon ne apana ashiana bana rakhaa he
 The place ahead is called Patalganga
 is kile main ek do nahin balki kai tarah kii guphaae bani hui hai, jinka istemaal us kaal main simaaon kii hifaazat ke liye hota tha
 There was another mysterious cave at the back end of the fort
 is gupha main ghanaa andhera tha or iske andar ajeeb tarah kii awaajen aa rahi thi
 The Rahsmayi fort of Kalinjar has seven doors
 in saat daravaajon main ek darwaja aisa he, jo sirf raat ke sannaate main khulata he or yahaan se niklaa ek rasta ranimahal le jaataa he jahaan raat kii khamoshi ko ghunghruon kii awaazen tod detii hai or inhi ghunghruon kii awaz sunne ke liye ab hamen shaam dhalane kaa kaa intazaar karnaa tha
 Actually there is Rani Mahal present in Kalinjar Fort
 ek daur tha jab is mahal main har raat mehfilein sajaa karti thim
 Those who say that today even after 1500 years, a dancer's footsteps start moving in the same way
 bas fark yah he ki ab in ghunghruon kii aawaaj dil bahalaati nahin balki dil dahala jaati he
 Ghungroo's voice is that of a dancer named Padmavati
 gazab kii khubasurat is nartki kii jo bhi ek jhalak dekh letaa vahi uskaa divaana ban baithta
 It is said that when music flowed from his ghungroo, Chandel Raja would be bound in it
 padmavati bhagwaan shiv kii bhakt thi
 Therefore, especially on the day of Kartik Purnima, she danced freely throughout the night
 pachhamaati ab nahin he, par hairaani kii baat ye he ki hazaron saal baad aaj bhi ye kila padmavati ke ghugharuon kii awaz se aabaad he
 Historians themselves also believe this truth
 research ke dauraan ek baar unhen der raat is mahal main ruknaa padaa or phir raat kii khamoshi main achaanak unhen vahi ghunghruon kii aawaaj sunai dene lagi
 The history of this fort is thousands of years old that people still get drawn towards these desolate ruins
 ye kila darasal chandel samrajya kii milakiyat hua karata tha
 But apart from the history of the fort, people are more interested in the treasure hidden in the fort
 is kile ne ab tak jitani bhi ladaaiyaan jheli wo sab khajaane ko lekar hi huin
 There are rumors that a large stock of diamonds and jewels is present in the fort of Kalinjar
 pahari par maujuud is kile main chitrakaari or pattharon par hui nakkashi dekhakar andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki is kile main kaaphi dhan daulat rahi hogi
 Historical evidence suggests that the fort of Kalinjar was ruled by the Chandels from the 6th century to the 15th century
 is kile ko gaznavi, qutubuddin aibak or humayun ne inase jeetna chaha, lekin kaamyaab nahin ho paae
 This miraculous fort was known by different names in every era of history, which is also mentioned in the Hindu texts
 darasal kalinger kaa matlab hota he kaal ko jarjar karne vaala
 Apart from thrills and wonders, the mythological significance of Kalinjar is also related to Shiva's poisoning
 samudr manthan main mili kalkut ke paan ke baad shiv ne isi kalinger main vishram karke kaal kii gati ko maat di thi, isliye is jagah kaa naam kalinger padaa
 There is another pool inside the mountain above the Neelkanth temple, from which it is called Swarga
 ise bhi dharm se joda jaataa he
 There is a mystery somewhere in the fort of Kalinjar, standing on the mountains with a sarcasm, then the fear of the Ghanghurs
 kahin tilismi chamatkaar he, to kahin andheri gufaaon kaa romaanch
 This is the reason why amazing examples of arts and crafts still exist
 rahi baat khoff kii, to is kile kii kubsuurati kii roshni main khoff kaa saaya bhi dhundhala padataa hi nazar aata he

 RSS does not believe in the ban on books
 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat said on Tuesday that the Sangh cannot be tied to any ideology
 sangh kisi bhi vichaar main vishwaas nahin karata he or use kisi bhi pustak se darshaya ja saktaa he
 Which includes the book of the second head of the Sangh, MS Golwalkar
 unhone kaha, 'sangh kaa mukhya mulya yah he ki bharat ek hindu raashtra he or isse koi samjhauta nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 'mohan Bhagwat said this on the occasion of the release of a new book by Sunil Ambedkar, the head of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)

 But the RSS believes in reaching consensus, not in debate

 The RSS never calls for a ban, whether we agree with the viewpoint or not

 (from input language) tihaad jail main khudakushi, wo bhi aise hai profile cese ke mukhya aaropee kii, jise lekar puure desh main tahalaka machaa hua tha
 Obviously, questions arise
 akhir kaise koi kaidi, jail kii barrack main faansee laga saktaa he
 Did the Tihar Jail security personnel claim tight security around the clock? ramsingh kii khudakushi ne tihaad jail prashasan ke ravaiye ko sawaalon ke ghere main laa khadaa kiya he
 Important questions are arising on the manner of hanging, time and circumstances and many other things
 ab baat karte hai takneekee sawaalon kii
 1
 ram singh kaa kad saadhe 5 feet tha aise main uske haath 7 feet oonche roshanadaan tak kaise ja pahunche
 2
 jis tarah bataaya ja rahaa he ki ram singh ne dari-kambal or kapadon ko fadkar rassi banaai us par bhi sawaal uth rahe hai
 3 prisoners were sleeping in Ram Singh's cell
 rassi banane main kaafii vakt laga hoga, ajeeb baat he ki kisi ko is baat kii bhanak kaise nahin lagi
 3
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki usne pajame ke naade kaa istemaal bhi faansee lagane ke liye kya
 Why was he given such clothes? 4
 ram singh ke gharavaale ek ahm sawaal uthaa rahe hai ki jis shaks kaa ek haath karaab tha, usne sirf ek haath se kis tarah rassi bhi bana lee, fanda bhi bana liya or phir ek hi haath ke sahare khud ko fande se lataka bhi liya
 5
 sawaal ye bhi he ki ram singh ne faansee lagane ke liye subah 5 baje kaa vakt kyon chunaa, jabaki 5 baje kaidiyon ko jagaa diya jaataa he
 So is the Tihar Jail Administration covering some facts
 6
 The question is also why despite such great negligence, no action has been taken so far
 7
 Ram Singh was the main accused in the gang-rape case, why his security was not taken care of
 8
 You will remember that when Ramsingh was brought to Tihar, the prisoners beat him up badly
 uske baad ramsingh ko alag cell main rakhaa gaya tha
 Now the question is whether Ram Singh was monitored 24 hours outside the cell, despite this much happening
 9
 What special arrangements were made to protect the accused of such a sensitive case
 10
 And the biggest question is that before Ram Singh's suicide, why did the jail administration not suspect that he could execute such an incident
 
 
 pehle se ehtiyaati ingizaam kyon nahin kiye gaye
 Ram Singh's father has expressed doubts about suicide
 pita kaa daawa he ki ram singh khudakushi karne waalon main se nahin tha
 He has demanded a CBI inquiry
 cese se jude vakil bhi ise khudakushi maanane ko taiyaar nahin
 The main accused in this case, which shook the country, was hanged in Tihar Jail on Monday morning
 ravivaar raat se wo baichaiyn tha
 There were 3 more prisoners present in his barrack
 tahaltey dekha tha or subah 5 baje jail ke guard ne use darvaaze ke upar bane roshanadaan se latakta paaya
 According to the jail authorities, Ram Singh made rope from blankets, blankets and his clothes from the jail and made a noose hanging from Pazamay's pulse
 ram singh tihaad kii jail number 3 main band tha

 On reaching Samadhi's death, he left for Indore in the evening
 jodhpur police ke shikanje se bachane ke liye asaram baapu bhaage-bhaage gum rahe hai
 Asaram adopted every tactic

 He, however, also said that there is no specific information at this time to indicate that there is a connection between lashkar-e-taiba and terrorist groups like Babbar Khalsa International and Khalistan Zindabad Force
 maakan ne amar singh ke prashn ke likhit uttar main bataaya ki bhartiya suraksha agenciyaan aatankwaad kaa muqabla karne ke prayaas main paraspar sahyog ke sthapit tantra ke madhyam se malaysia main apni samakaksh agenciyon se sampark banaae hue hai

 team india isisi world cap ke semifinal main pahunch chuki he
 On 9 July in Manchester, the Virat Brigade will face New Zealand
 is match main haar-jeet se pehle sabaki nazren toss par hongi
 This is because the teams batting first have done better by winning the toss in this mahagram of cricket
 newjiland ke khilaaf semifinal mukaable main chej master viraat kohli bhi apni ranneeti main badlaav karnaa nahin chahenge
 In such a situation, if Virat Kohli wins the toss, then he would like to bat first
 5 baar pehle ballebaaji karte hue jiti team indiyakul milakar bharat ne is toornament main 5 baar pehle ballebaaji karte hue jeet hasil kii
 At the same time, India won by chasing 2 times
 iske alaava ek match main england ne bharat ko target chej karne se roak diya or bharat ko is mukaable main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 India's performance so far in World Cup 2019 First match - Chasing India defeated South Africa by 6 wickets Second match - India batted first and defeated Australia by 36 runs Third match - Match against New Zealand was canceled due to rain Match - Bat first and beat Pakistan by 89 runs - Fifth match - Bat first and beat Afghanistan by 11 runs - Sixth match - India batted first and West Indies defeated by 125 runs
 Twenty-seven match - England batted first and India lost by 31 runs
 Eight match - India batted first against Bangladesh and won by 28 runs
 India won the match by chasing Sri Lanka
 Defeated by 7 wickets, won the toss 4 times and won four times
 India won the toss in this World Cup 4 times and Virat Kohli chose to bat first
 dilachasp baat yah he ki in chaaron muqablon main bharat ko jeet hasil hui
 At the same time, Kohli lost the toss 4 times, in which Team India got a chance to bat first and in this match India defeated Pakistan by 89 runs
 iske alaava teen maichon main bharat ko target kaa peechha karne kaa mauka mila jisamen kohli kii team ko 2 baar jeet hasil hui or ek baar england ke haathon haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The pitch in the World Cup 2019: The team batting 27 times in 41 matches played in the 2019 World Cup has won
 vahiin, sirf 14 baar hi duusari baar ballebaaji karne vaali tiimon ko jeet mil saki he
 Talking about 21 matches of the start of World Cup 2019, the team batting 11 times has won them
 vahiin, 10 baar hi aisa hua ki target ko chej karne vaali team ne match jeeta ho
 Apart from this, if you look at the result of the subsequent 20 matches in the World Cup 2019, then it looks completely different from the 21 matches played earlier
 baad ke 20 muqablon main 16 baar pehle ballebaaji karne vaali team ko jeet mili he
 At the same time, only the team chasing the target 4 times has won
 dhimi hoti gai world cap kii pichenkul milakar jaise-jaise world cap kaa safar aage badha, pehle ballebaaji karne vaali tiimon ko phayda mila
 India's fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah has also pointed this out
 unhone kaha ki world cap main samay ke saath pich dhimi ho rahi he
 In such a situation, the team batting first gets the advantage because the pitch becomes rough till the second innings, due to which the ball does not come properly on the bat
 aise main semifinal mukaable main viraat kohli bhi world cap ke is trend ke saath hi janaa pasand karenge
 If they do, then by batting first, Team India can make a big total and put the opposing camp under pressure and cover it cheaply

 "they are also green spaces," explains John Varghese, one of the reasons for their existence is to make students feel freedom
 ''vargeez maanate hai ki har ped apane fal se pahachaanaa jaataa he or yah baat collejon par bhi lagu hoti he
 One of the cases in which St
 Stephens considers himself different is his students
 saal-dar-saal college ne achook pratishtha hasil kii he or desh ke kone-kone se behtareen chaatro ko aakarshith kiya he, jinhone academix, jan niti, raajnneeti or khel ke kshetron main jhande gaade hai

 Speaking in a special discussion on the situation in Afghanistan, Puri said, 'of course, NATO is claiming that the' operation in Afghanistan is complete 'on the basis of recent terrorist incidents and violence but to' retreat 'in a similar way There is no preparation for the terrorist organizations operating on the border there
 ’puri ne kaha ki afghanistan main hone vaale parivartanon ne ab tak us kshetra or duniya kii suraksha ko prabhavit kiya he or aage bhi aisa hi hoga

 jaraa ek baat to bataaie aap ke saath kitni baar aisa hua ki aap kisi party main gaye, vahaan kisi mahila ne aapako dekha or muskaraa di
 When you tried to talk to him on his smile, there was frustration and when there was no conversation, you kept on regretting for the next three to four days
 agar aapke saath aisa akasar hota he, to yakeenan aapako jarurat he soch samaj kar riect karne kii
 This time, if you go to the party, then adopt some new tricks and the effect of a new friend until the party ends
 
 
 agar vah aap par sarsari najar daalati hai yaa chehre par musakaraahat ke saath aapako dekhati hai, in ishaaron ko galat na samajhen

 Relationship expert Payal Puri says that when he looks at you with cursory attention, pay attention to whether his face is also in your direction, just towards you
 agar aisa he, to ho saktaa he ki vah aapse baat karnaa chaahati hai
 Keep yourself in control, if she really likes you and is admiring you, then take care of yourself
 zyada strang dikhne kii koshish na karen
 Their purpose of looking at you may be something else, which you may not have even thought of
 ji haa, zyaadaatar mahilaayein kisi ko pehali nigaah main pasand karne ke baad man hi man ganit ladati hai
 Mathematics about how you will engage with them
 isliye apni body language kaa dhyaan rakhen
 Instead of showing yourself strong, just look at their body language and try to match themselves to them
 khud ko baar baar aaine main na dekhen or haa baalo main jarurat se zyada haath na pheren
 Tomana is fond of drinking, that parties have the opportunity to drink heavily and have relaxation
 lekin agar aap chaahate hai ki jis mahila ko pichley kuch second se aap impress karne kii koshish kar rahe hai, vah impress ho jaae to janaab drink ke glass ko aaj ke liye to bhul hi jaaen
 Do not let them feel that drinking is very important for you
 agar aap chaah kar bhi glass neeche nahin rakh sakate, to use apane ulte haath main pakaden taaki nae logon se milte vakt haath milaane main pareshaani na ho
 Pick up on the dining table At the dining table you can start talking to them
 yah ek aisa mauka hota he, jab aap kisi bhi aparichit se bejhijak baatcheet kar sakate hai
 Start a normal conversation and then you know better how to keep their minds on it
 sunanaa band karembaatcheet ko dauraan un kii baton ko achche se sunate hi na rahen

 By doing this, you will be able to listen to her as well as say her words, so that she will be able to trust you

 loksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar votaron ko lubhaane ke liye bijepi ne 'chaay kii chaoupal' ke baad ab dakshin bharat main 'machhlee kaa stall' lagaaya he
 The party's reasoning behind this Modi imprint stall in Tamil Nadu is that it will bring it closer to the people
 lekin philhal is stall par machuaaraa samaaj kii jo pratikriya aa rahi he, usase yahi lagata he ki machhlee kaa yah kanta bijepi ke gale main funsane vaala he
 In fact, BJP has also become active in the state after the AIADMK issued the election manifesto in view of the elections

 According to fishermen, the way the BJP is selling fish at a cheaper rate in the market by putting up stalls, the fish sellers are facing problems
 bazaar main ab un par bhi kam keemat main machhlee bechney kaa dawaab ban rahaa he
 Fish seller Manivannan says, "if the BJP puts up more such stalls ahead, people will demand fish at a lower price than us
" yah unki vot niti ho sakati he, lekin isse hamen phayda nahin hoga
 'significantly, after 2004 in Tamil Nadu, BJP has not made any significant progress
 aise main party 'namo machhlee stall' ke jariye janaadhar batorne kii koshish main juty he
 The party says that the stall will take them closer to the people in coastal areas like Chennai, Rameswaram, Kanyakumari, Nagapattinam
 bijepi rashtriya kaarysmiti ke sadsy tamilisai saundarajan kehete hai, 'ham machuaaron se machhlee kharid kar use kam keemat par garib logon main bech rahe hai
 This is a mobile unit and it will not cause any problems to the people but will benefit the fishermen
 jab ammaa pradesh main apane naam par kam keemat par khaadya padaarth bech sakati he to ham kyon nahin?''yah raajnneeti nahin trade fere he'raajnneeti ke is trend par raajnneetik visheshgy ganani shankaran kehete hai, 'rajanetaaon ne raajnneeti ko bijness bana diya he

 sawan maah main kii jane vaali shiv kii upasna or wo bhi sawan ke somvaar ko kii jane vaali shiv bhakthi har bhakt ke jivan main sukh laati he
 The fast of the fourth and last Monday is very auspicious in the episode of Monday fast of the month of Savan
 manyata he ki agar aapane aakhri somvaar kaa vrath rakh kar liya or bholenath kii puja to sabhi somvaaron kaa fal or punya praapt ho jayega
 Religious belief is that by fasting on Monday, one gets rid of all sorrows, sorrows and troubles and enjoys a happy, healthy and prosperous life
 sawan maah ke somvaar vrath kii kadi main chauthe or antim somvaar kaa vrath behad shubh he
 This day is the Dwadashi date with Monday whose integer is formed by 3, whose lord is Guru and Moon is located in Sagittarius, the sign of Guru
 ye wo yoga he jisamen shiv kii aradhana or vrath karne se un samast samasyaon kaa nidaan ho jaataa he jinhen lekar bhakt asahaay mahasoos kar rahe hai
 If the pundits are to be believed, whoever worships Shiva on the fourth Monday of the month of Sawan will receive the special blessings of Shiva
 is din puja karne se bacchon kii beemaari dur ho sakati he, durghatana or akaal mrityu se mukti milti he, sarkaar se judi pareshaaniyon hal ho jaati hai saath hi bhakt ko aadhyatmik utthan hota he
 The pundits also say that even if you have not kept any fast on Monday of Sawan, there is nothing to be worried about
 kyonki agar aapane aakhri somvaar kaa vrath rakh kar liya or bholenath kii puja to sabhi somvaaron kaa fal or punya praapt ho jayega
 Overall, on this last Monday of the month of Sawan, if you have taken a little time for Rudrabhishek and have meditated in God, then the blessings of God in the form of happiness will come and you will go out of bed
 captain mahendra singh dhoni ke garh ranchi main england ko buree tarah parrast karne ke baad ab bhartiya cricket team buudhvaar ko punjab cricket sangh (pisie) maidan par hone vaale chauthe match main mehmaan team ko haraakar paanch maichon kii is siries ko apane naam karnaa chaahegi
 In an international cricket match played for the first time in Ranchi, the Indian team performed endlessly
 usne english team ko saste main sametane ke baad saat wicket se jeet hasil kii thi
 This performance of the Indian team continues from Kochi and the players are encouraged due to this
 isi buland hausale ke dam par bharat pisie maidan par is siries ko apane naam kar england ko lagaataar teesri baar bharat main vanade siries haarane par majaboor karnaa chaahegi
 Although India has won 5–0, 5–0 on the last two occasions but this time the figure may be slightly changed as the English team has opened the winning account in the first match of the series in Rajkot
 rajkot match tak english team ke liye sabakuch acha chal rahaa tha lekin achaanak uske liye sameekaran badal chuke hai
 English team captain Alastair Cook will be in a dilemma as to whether the game of his teammates has declined or the level of Indian players have improved
 is asamanjas main cook ke liye mohali or phir dharmashala main jeet hasil karne main mushkil aa sakati he
 Cook needs to understand that his team lacks consistency in performance
 kabhi uskaa sheersh kram pehle wicket ke liye shatkeey saajhedaari karata he or kabhi 50 ran bhi nahin jod paata he
 Sometimes his middle order bats, and sometimes runs for runs
 yahi haal gendbaajon kaa he
 Due to lack of consistency in their performance, the English team lost in Kochi and then Ranchi
 ranchi main vaise english gendbaajon ke saamne match bachaane ke liye ek tarah se surakshit lakshya nahin tha
 The credit for this goes to the Indian bowlers, who cheaply assimilated the English team on the basis of their diversity and then the batsmen did their job to win by seven wickets but the failure of the opening pair is still a cause for concern for India
 virendra sahvaag ke sthaan par team main shaamil kiye gaye ajinkya rahane lagaataar naakaam rahe hai or yahi kaaran he ki coach dancan flechar ne unke liye khaas abhyaas satr kaa aayojan kiya or mohali main unki ballebaaji par gaur kiya
 Rahane is a quality batsman
 unke farm main lautne se bharat ko kaaphi majbootee milegi lekin philhal iske asaar kam hai
 In such a situation, the middle order of India will have to play the responsibility of scoring runs

 Shamsher is also among the poets who have done some planned work here in connection with birth centenaries
 or idhar jin logon ne shamsher par duubakar likhaa he, unamem haal hi ai jyotish joshi kii pustak shamsher kaa arth mahatvapurn he
 There is also a Shamsher edited by Dudhanath Singh in which Shriram Verma, Malayaj, Premlata Verma, Neelima Thakur, Ajay Singh, Shobha Singh and Bhasha Singh along with him have tried to touch all aspects of Shamsher's life, personality and his works closely
 And the specifics of Shamsher's attitude have also been dispelled with sincerity, yet in single endeavors, Shamsher's meaning is left behind as it is complex, immortal and challenging
 Takes the path of judicial evaluation of Shamsher

 Therefore, with the dedication of a poetess, he has sought to delve into the perceived complexity of Shamsher

 In 'poor Aakash Ka Aakash', Shamsher's poetry is conveyed by his perceived silence, the empty gaps and the poet's vibrations expressed in the poem, beaming as Joshi admits that 'his poem is a full sky, with an iridescent rhythm
 Is blue, dark pink, cloudy, cloudy smoke
 
 
 'main samajhataa hum, shamsher ko samajhane ke liye aalochak kaa hath nahin, ek kavi-man sareekhee sahrudayata chahie, jisaki baangi yahaan pag-pag par drushtavy he

 par phir sochaa ki kya pataa hajaaron logon ko maarane ke baad bagdadi ab badal chukaa ho
 Visit us to reach the world
 hamase baat kar le or phir hamen jane de
 Within 24 hours of hiding our identity, within 24 hours of reaching Baghdad, we ourselves strangled our thinking
 kya karte? bagdadi to dur hamen to har koi vahaan jane se roak rahaa tha, jahaan kabhi bagdadi ke paanv bhi pade the
 All those who wanted our well-being, from Baghdad to Mosul, were advising us to hide our camera, mic, our identity, everything
 taaki bagdadi ke kisi gurgey yaa shahar main bhesh badal kar chupe uske sleeper cell kii najar ham par naa pad jaae
 And they may not get the news that we are Hindi Sahafi i
e
 Indian Journalist
 camere kaa darkhir bagdadi naa sahi
 But his news had to be found
 par dikkat ye thi ki puure iraq main aam iraqi, police, sena sab aapse bahut pyaar se baat karenge
 But as soon as you take out the camera or move the mic towards them, everyone becomes dumb
 hamen baad main pataa chalaa ki saddaam ke daur se shaq kaa jo maahaul is desh main bana he
 He is in awe even today
 unhen lagata he ki pataa nahin camere par kuch bol dipha to unke saath koun si sarkari agency kya kar baithe?ek sur main sabane kaha- mar chukaa he bagdadiphir bhi hamen jahaan jaisaa mauka miltaa or jaraa si bhi ummid lagati usee se bagdadi kaa sach jaanane kii koshish shuru kar dete
 But every time this attempt would end with the same result
 bagadagi mar chukaa he
 Yes, we spoke to the common Iraqi, Iraqi Intelligence, Iraqi Special Forces, the Iraqi Army and even the Iraqi Police in a different way
 poochtacha kii
 But everyone gave us the same answer with confidence that Baghdadi is no longer alive
 wo mar chukaa he
 But how did Baghdadi die? kahaan mara
 When died kisne use maaraa? hamen ye bhi jaananaa tha
 Because even before that we had heard about the death of Baghdadi 6 times
 lihaaja hamane jab gaharaai main jaakar unhen tatola to unka kahana tha ki bagdadi ko roosi bam ne maaraa he or wo bhi isi saal
 Baghdadi's death claim: Common Iraqis believe that Baghdadi has been killed in the bombing of the city of Raqqa in Syria on 11 June this year
 unka kahana tha ki rakka shahar main syria or roosi sena kii safed phosforus bombing main abu bakar al bagdadi pehle ghayal hua or phir uski maut ho gai
 Iraqi local media had also reported in June that the area of raqqa city targeted was not only a stockpile of ISIS weapons, but also its leader Abu Bakr al-baghdadi was also present there
 bagdadi ko abhi bhi talash kar rahaa he americamgar bagdadi kii maut kaa daawa karne waalon ke ulat hamen kuch log aise bhi mili jinka kahana tha ki bagdadi ab bhi jinda he
 But is injured ab sawaal ye tha ki agar bagdadi jinda he to kahaan chupa ho saktaa he? kya ab bhi iraq main he yaa phir syria ke kisi ilaake main? aapako bataa den ki bagdadi kii maut ke roosi daawey par america ne bhi abhi tak muhar nahin lagaai he
 The US says it has no strong evidence of Baghdadi's death
 isiilie das milian dollar ke inami bagdadi kii talash america abhi bhi kar rahaa he
 Baghdadi may be hiding in al-baz! US intelligence sources say ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-baghdadi may be hiding in a place named al-baz, about two hundred kilometers west of Mosul, Iraq's second largest city
 ye jagah behad kam aabaadi vaali or alag-thalag he
 As well as ISIS bearing
 al baj ke alaava suraksha agenciyaan rakka kii kuch khaas buildings par bhi nazren gadaaye hai
 There is a doubt that Baghdadi may also be here
 dhah gaye bagdadi ke kilewaise bagdadi agar sachmuch jinda he to bhi uske chupane kii jagah ab lagaataar sikudti ja rahi he
 Because every fort he won is constantly crumbling
 faluja, ramaadi, samaara, tikreet, baiji, sadiya, jalavala, mosul, tal-afar, abu kamaal, haviza or anah ko iraqi fouj waapas jeet chuki he
 These are the small and big cities of Iraq, where ISIS has been completely destroyed
 iesas ke kai netaa faraoctober ke aakhri hafte main iraqi forcej ne havija se bhi aies ko ukhaad phenkaa he
 Iraqi Special Forces drove hundreds of militants from Havija during a two-week-long fierce struggle
 ab havija par bhi puri tarah se iraqi sena kaa kabja he
 It is reported that after the defeat of Haviza, many big leaders of ISIS have fled or surrendered
 ravaa or kaim shahar ko mukt karaane kii taiyaariiraq ke ek-ek ilaake se khadede jane or aies ke bade netaaon or commander ke bhaag jane ke baad bache hue aatankiyon main jabardast ghabrahat he
 Along with their lack of weapons to fight, they have also got shortage of money
 jisaki vajah se bache hue aatanki jaan bachaane ke liye sarender kar rahe hai
 In total, there are now only two such cities in Iraq, which are under the occupation of IS
 ek ravaa or doosraa qaim
 The Iraqi army is now marching towards these areas as well, and the news of IS annihilation can be revealed from here too soon

 Maulana Abdul Hamid Azhri, secretary of AIMPLB, said that the issue of Mehram going on Haj pilgrimage without Muslim women is purely religious

 The ban on Mehram has been lifted

 PM Modi said that he has suggested to the Minority Ministry to ensure that all such women, who are applying to go to Haj without Mehram, get permission to perform Haj
 modi ne kaha, ''aamtaur par desh menhajayatriyon ke liye lottery system he, lekin main chaahunga ki akeli mahilaon ko is system se baahar rakhaa jaae
 Meanwhile, Minister of Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi assured that women applying to go on Haj pilgrimage without Mehram will be exempted from the lottery system

 The Saint High Powers Committee of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has decided to challenge the Allahabad High Court's decision on 30 September to divide the disputed ramjanmabhoomi-babri Masjid site in Ayodhya in the Supreme Court
 vihip kii ucchadhikaar praapt sant samiti kii buudhvaar ko hui baithak kii adhyakshata karne vaale swami vasudevanand saraswati ne samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya ki santon kii samiti kaa nirnay he ki vivaadit sthal ko teen bhaagon main baantne ke elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ke faisle ke viruddh ucchtam nyaayalay main apil kii jaayegi or yah daayitv ramalala virajman ke baalasakhaa ke rup main pakshakaar trilokinath pandeya ko saunpi jaayegi
 VHP President Ashok Singhal, who was present at the press conference along with Swami Saraswati, said that the court has accepted that the disputed site is the birthplace of Lord Ram and the Sant Samiti believes that Ram and Ram Janmabhoomi are revered and cannot be divided
 singhl ne ramajanm sthaan ke bantwaare ko desh ke bantwaare jaisaa bataate hue kaha ki is vivaad kaa samaadhaan vivaadit sthal ke bantwaare se nahin ho saktaa kyonki adaalat ne mana he ki sari bhoomi ramalala kii he
 Reiterating the resolve to construct a grand Ram temple at the entire disputed site, Singhal said that the Government of India should make a law and hand over the entire disputed site to the Hindu society for the construction of Ram temple
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki vihip ke ucchadhikaar praapt sant samiti kaa ek pratinidhimandal 23 athwa 24 aktubar ko pradhanmantri da
 After meeting Manmohan Singh, he will demand from him that the Central Government should enact the law and hand over the entire Ram Janmabhoomi to the Hindu society and enact the same law to pave the way for the construction of Ram temple as was done for the Somnath temple
 singhl ne spasht kiya, ‘ayodhya kii saanskrithik seemaa ke bheetar kisi masjid kaa nirmaan unhen sweekaar nahin hoga
 Regarding the ongoing efforts towards resolution of the dispute through the talks, Singhal said that in the past, at least four times there have been efforts in this direction but they have not been successful
 vihip adhyaksh singhl ne yah bhi kaha ki chunki ayodhya ek dharmik tirth kendra bhi he, iskaa samuchit vikaas karne ke liye ayodhya tirth vikaas praadhikaran kaa gathan kiya janaa chahie
 He said that all the Shraddha Kendras mentioned in the Valmiki Ramayana should be developed as religious pilgrimage sites by forming the Development Authority
 singhl ne kaha ki ram janmabhumi sthal par ramalala kaa bhavy mandir banane ke liye vihip kii taraf se chalaaya ja rahaa jan jaagran kaarykram mandir ban jane tak chalata rahegaa
 Swami Vishweshwar Tirthaji Maharaj of Udipi said that if Muslim society wants to build a mosque somewhere other than the disputed site, then our doors are always open to resolve the matter outside the court
 unhone kaha, ‘muslim samaaj ke saamne avasar he ki vah vivaadit sthal se apana daawa chhodkar donon samudaayon ke bich aapasi vishwaas or bhaichaare ko majboot karne main apana yogadan de
 'in a resolution passed in the meeting, the saints have said that the path of dispute resolution is always open by mutual dialogue and we are always ready to cooperate positively in any endeavor in this direction according to our cultural life values and norms
 prastaav main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki ucch nyaayalay ne vivaadit sthal ke ek tihaai bhaag ko musalamaanon ke hisse main diye jane kaa faisla karke muslim samaaj ko ek sunaharaa mauka diya he ki ve us bhubhag ko ramamandir ke liye samarpit kar donon samudaayon ke bich paraspar sauhaard kaa nayaa adhyay shuru karen
 Describing the entire disputed site as the land of Lord Rama's sports, leela and rites, Swami Tirthaji Maharaj said that the court has also accepted that the disputed site is the birthplace of Lord Rama and he is the owner of the entire land
 vihip adhyaksh singhl ne bataaya ki sant ucchadhikaar samiti ke nirnyon kii jaankaree dene ke liye guuruuvaar ko ayodhya ke sabhi sthaneey sant mahatmaon kii ek baithak bulaayi gayi he
 Meanwhile, despite being a member of the Sant High Powered Committee, the President of the Akhara Council, Swami Gyanadas, did not attend this meeting

 bachapan main donon bhai hockey khilne ke liye jate hai, lekin coach ke bartaav se naakhush hokar sandip hockey khelnaa nahin chahta he
 One day, Sandeep's eye strikes female hockey player Harpreet (taapsee Pannu) and falls in love with her
 'suurama' kii screening main beti sara-patni sang pahunche sachin tendulkarharprit chaahati he ki sandip hockey khele or desh ke liye world cap main bhi hissaa le
 Because of this Sandeep starts playing hockey
 isamen uske bade bhai vikramjit singh kaa bahut bada haath hota he
 The twist in the story comes when once Sandeep Singh sits in a train to take part in international competition, he gets shot on his back
 iske baad wo coma main chale jate hai
 When he comes out of coma, the lower part of his body paralyzes
 iske baad sandip singh kaa asli sangharsh shuru hota he
 Why see? The screenplay of the film is amazing, due to which the speed is accurate
 film kii cinemetography acchhee he or kahani sunaane kaa dhang kamaal kaa he
 Some sentences make you think and sometimes you become emotional
 dilajit dosanjh ko screen par dekhakar lagata he ki wo dilajit nahin balki sandip singh hai

 Vijay Raj has played the role of a coach very well
 unke samvaad kaaphi hansaate he
 The release of Surma's new song, Diljit and Tapasikamajor Kaadhi in the mood of celebration: The film's weak link is its pace, which slowly moves forward
 ise durust karnaa bahut jaruri tha
 The music of the film has not been much of a hit
 filmakan ke dauraan sandip singh ke hockey match, paariwarik rishte or khaastaur se prem sambandh ko or behatar or zyada maatra main darshaya jaataa to film or bhi zyada chhu paane main sakasham ho paati

 People were even more surprised to know the reason for the lock in the office
 idhar daftar band hone kii vajah se adhikari bhi apni upasthiti darj nahin kara paae or idhar-udhar bhatakate rahe
 After some time, he returned to his workplace to escape the anger of Deputy Mayor Kale
 dipti meyar devidas kaale ne kaha ki maujuuda work culture ke liye tatkaaleen congress shashan he
 "for the last two years, we have been trying to do something good here, but the old habits of Congress rule have not completely ended yet, to warn me this hard," Kale told news agency IANS

 The Lok Sabha elections were in 2014 when there was a Modi wave all over the country
 kai siton par aise chehre jitkar saamne aae, jisaki isse pehle koi khaas pahchaan nahin thi
 But in this Modi wave, Arun Jaitley, one of the big leaders of BJP, lost the election, that too from Amritsar seat
 party ne yahaan se 3 baar ke saansad rahe navjot singh siddhu ko darkinar kar jetali ko maidan main utaara tha
 However, the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat has always been known for high profile and major vicissitudes
 raajnneetik prishthbhumivaise amritsar kaa apana gauravamayi itihaas he
 The Golden Temple is the biggest attraction of Amritsar
 puraa amritsar shahar swarna mandir ke chaaron taraf basaa he
 Apart from its culture, Amritsar is also famous for battles
 bhartiya swatantraaa sangram kaa sabase bada narsanhaar amritsar ke jaliyanvaala baag main hi hua tha
 After this, this city is also witness to the bloodshed during the partition between India and Pakistan
 afgaan or mughal shaskaon ne bhi is shahar ko tabah kar diya tha
 Like this, the Sikhs have revived this city with their strong will
 amritsar shahar kaa jitna gauravamayi itihaas rahaa he, utana hi raajnneeti main is shahar kaa ahm sthaan rahaa he
 The Lok Sabha seat here has always been a high profile
 2014 kaa janadeshkarib do dashak tak amritsar loksabhaa seat ek tarah se bijepi kaa garh rahaa
 But in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, this seat went to the Congress account
 congress ke diggaj netaa amarinder singh ne bijepi ke bade netaa arun jetali ko 1 lakh se zyada voton se haraa diya
 Capt Amarinder Singh received a total of 4,82,876 votes with 48 per cent votes, while Jaitley got 37
 74 fisad vot ke saath 3,80,106 vot mili
 Third was Daljit Singh of Aam Aadmi Party, who had to be satisfied with 82,633 votes
 upachunaav main panje kii pakad or majbootalekin amarinder singh ke mukhyamantri ban jane ke baad 2017 main amritsar loksabhaa seat par upachunaav hua, or congress ne is seat par apana kabja barkaraar rakhaa
 Congress's Gurjit Singh Aujla defeated bjp's Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina by a margin of one lakh 99 thousand 189 votes, and the difference between the two parties was about 20 percent
 yani is seat par dhire-dhire congress ne apni pakad majboot kar lee he
 But till 2009, this seat has been dominated by BJP
 lagaataar 2004, 2007 ke upachunaav or 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ke navjot singh siddhu ne baaji maari thi
 But now Sidhu himself has joined the Congress
 amritsar sidh par akali dal kii najaravaise amritsar loksabhaa seat par ab bijepi ke sahyogi shiromani akali dal (badal) kii najar he
 In return, BJP can get Ludhiana seat
 akali dal is seat se manjinder singh sirsa ko chunaav ladaane kii taiyaari main he
 Sirsa is an Akali Dal MLA from Rajouri Garden in Delhi and has been made the observer of Amritsar district at present
 haalanki bijepi ko yahaan se chunaav ladaane ke liye kisi bade sikh netaa kii talash he
 Sidhu can also contest elections from Amritsar and there is another news that Congress can field Navjot Singh Sidhu from here
 iske peeche do kaaran bataae ja rahe hai
 One is holding Sidhu on this seat and the other is amused by Sidhu's estrangement with Amarinder Singh
 amarinder bhi chaahate hai ki siddhu ko amritsar seat ke jariye loksabhaa bhej diya jaae, taaki punjab main unako siddhu se chunauti naa mili
 Social warfare: If we look at this Lok Sabha seat since independence, the Congress has dominated it
 1952 se ab tak congress ne 12 baar yahaan se jeet darj kii he, amritsar loksabhaa ke andar kul 9 vidhansabha siten hai
 Of this, the Congress is in possession of 8, while the Akali Dal has won one seat
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke aadhaar par amritsar main kul 14,77,262 voters hai, jinamein 7,79,164 purush or 6,98,098 mahila voters hai
 The city of Amritsar is named after a pond, which was built by Guru Ramdas
 swarna mandir ke alaava amritsar kaa purana shahar dekhne laayak he
 There is a wall around it, there are a total of 12 entrances, these 12 gates tell the story of Amritsar
 saansad kaa report cardmaujuuda samay se yahaan se congress ke gurjeet singh aujala saansad hai
 On his works, he has participated in a total of 6 Lok Sabha debates
 or 12 baar sawaal puche hai
 According to government figures, Aujla has used more than 80 percent of the mp's fund to fund the development of its region

 The players have returned to their national teams after a period of heavy rivalry for the European football season and are preparing for the World Cup playing some "friendly" matches
 moscow main vishwa cap mukaable shuru hone ke thik teen hafte pehle kiv main 27 may ko champions lig kaa final hua
 Some of the football junkies of his country traveled to Mumbai to see Captain Sunil Chhetri's 100th match for India
 chhetri ne do gol kiye or aakhri do maichon main apana aankada paanch gol kaa kar diya
 His total goals have reached an astonishing 61, making him just behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in the lineup of most goalscorers in an international match, becoming one of the most talented and talented players of all time
 haalanki chhetri ko footbal diwaanon se twitor par vyaktigat apil jari kerani padi
 After all, these crazy ad campaigns are charmed by the magic of European clubs and the World Cup in the charm of its "second country"
 aise main bhartiya footbal ke adhikariyon ko yah sawaal khud se jarur poochna chahie ki antarrashtriya footbal ke prati is deewangi ko aakhir ve kyon sthaneey klbon or rashtriya team ke sakriy samarthan main nahin badal pate?aakhir kyon ve apane aitihaasik klbon or khel ke prati jamini str se jaagrukta badhaane ke badale korporate dharre vaali lig main mashgool rahete hai jisamen europe ke ritair khiladinnon kaa bolbalaa rahata he?aaie phir kiv kaa rukh karen
 Mohammed Salah, who scored 44 goals in the final this year, was declared the best player in England, was seen holding his shoulder, walking out of the ground with tears in his eyes
 liverpool ke unke saathi khiladinnon ne maano kandhaa jhukaae gamgin chehron ke saath baaki kaa khel puraa kiya
 After all, his goal of scoring goals was lost
 ek golkeeper aisi chook kar baitha ki boston ke ek aspataal ne baad main kaha ki unhen usase baari dimagi aghat pahunchaa he
 What more can it be said that they are no longer in their senses? Such a departure from Salah's match is not a shock to the Liverpool sports enthusiasts
 har misravasi sir thame baitha he
 Egypt had not qualified for the World Cup since 1990
 vah 1934 main italy main final main pahunchane vaala pehla africa desh rahaa he (or sanyog se yah apane pehle or duusare vishwa cap main sabase adhik avadhi ke antaraal se pahunchane vaala desh bhi he)
 Egypt is also the most winning country in the African Cup of Nations (football competition of African countries) but its continental superiority could not be replicated in the World Cup
 africa footbal diwaanon ko to uske uttari africa ke padosi algeria tathaa morocco or pashchim africa ke pratidwandvi camerun, nigeria, ghana or senegal hi lubhaate rahe hai
 Not surprisingly, Salah's injury is being treated as a national disaster and is being treated in the same way
 salaah kii congou ke khilaaf aakhri palon main penalty kii vajah se rus main misr kii jagah pakki ho pai
 Indeed, the advice is so popular that he finished second in the Egyptian presidential election in March
 das lakh se zyada logon ne abdul fatah al sisi or musa mustafa musa jaise ummidavaaron ke badale ballat paper par salaah kaa naam likh diya
 Coming from the working class, this village boy does not seem completely changed despite his professional life in Switzerland, Italy and England
 ve pakke musalmaan hai, har gol ke baad ghutanon ke bal jhukkar dua karte hai, apni baari aamadani kaa ek hissaa desh main aspataal or skool kii imaaraten banavaane main kharch karte hai
 They are sociable, devoted to family, and get smiles on their faces all the time
 yah akut kamai or celebrity jaisi chamak-damak vaale khel ke khiladinnon main virale hi miltaa he
 Reports of Salah's shoulder injury condition are constantly being released
 doctoron kaa kahana he ki ve khilne ke liye feet ho jaaenge
 If the advice is in its full form, they can lead Egypt to the knockout rounds and host Russia may have to pay the price
 do saal pehle europea championships main rus kaa pradarshan itnaa lachar tha ki vah slovakia or wales se bhi pichad gaya
 These two countries could not even qualify for the World Cup
 to, ab rus bhala salaah ke misr or urugve ke jatke ko kahaan jhel paaegaa
 The hosts' first match is with Saudi Arabia and it could be a chance to boost their morale
 janvari main karodon pound kii peshkash par barsilona main jane ke pehle tak liverpool ke khilaadi rahe, brazil ke yuva midfilder philip kotinho ke mutabik, salaah is vishwa cap ke best player ho sakate hai
 However, Coutinho also named his fellow player Neymar with him
 sijan main zyaadaatar samay chotil rahe nemaar is khel ke iklaute aise sitare hai jinaki pahchaan kisi club kii bajaae apane desh se hi judi hui he
 Messi is considered to be the greatest player of his time in place of his performance in Barca instead of Argentina
 apane swadeshi tathaa jioeti khitaab ke liye unke pratispardhi maradona ke ulat mesi abhi tak vishwa cap yaa mahadeshiy khitaab jeetne ke liye apane saathi khiladinnon main damakham nahin bhar paae hai
 Argentina reached the finals in Brazil four years ago but put themselves in front of Germany's team, which specializes in very tight games, while the German team did not have the best performance
 lekin kabhi footbal ke diwaanon main nashe kii tarah utarane vaale vishwa cap kaa ab vah jalawaa nahin rahaa
 Now he is no longer a dazzling mahamela with a lot of unknown talents and unique sportsmanship
 jin deshon ke khilaadi apane hi desh main khelte hai, ve amuman group stage main hi baahar ho jate hai
 About 75 percent of the players who play in the rest of the World Cup are stars of clubs in Europe
 sabhi ukvada khilaadi spain, england, italy, germany yaa france main khelte hai
 Sportspeople from all over the world see them competing with each other almost every year
 is tarah vishwa cap europea footbal club maichon kaa hi ek or vistaar jaisaa lagane lagata he
 Superclubs such as Barca, Real, Manchester United, Liverpool, Juve, Inter, Bayern Munich etc
 have brought the mystery and thrill of football to a high
 isi vajah se vishwa cap ke group stage ke match ek behad jaruri taaji hawa lekar aa sakate hai
 Surely, the world's bourgeoisie who looted money by opening his briefcase in European club football will surely shrink his nose and eyeballs on his quality
 lekin footbal kaa romaanch, chaunkaau hunar or khubsuurati to nigeria banaam iceland yaa tunisia banaam panama yaa colombia banaam senegal jaise maichon main dikhegi
 Like the Champions League in these countries, football is no longer the pastime of waving trumpets
 is vishwa cap main zyaadaatar logon kii ummid yahi he ki nemaar behtareen footballar sabit honge kyonki mesi or ronaldo par umr chadhgaye lagi he, alabatta donon main hi abhi dhalaan kaa koi lakshan nahin dikh rahaa he or paris saint jarmen ko bark ke liye 22
 2 crore Euros have to be spent
 france kii footbal lig main kisi tarah ve chotil hote hue bhi bane rahe
 However, it is now rumored that he is going to wear Real's uniform again in Spain
 udhar, brazil ke nemaar khud se adhik ek bade makasad ke liye khel rahe hai
 As for Messina and Ronaldo respectively for Argentina and Portugal, they may play like the previous World Cup matches so that their strengths do not cover up any weaknesses
 france, brazil, germany or spain behtareen timen hai jabaki belgium main pratibhaaen bharpoor hai lekin unka apane sambhavit pratispardhiyon ke khel ke anubhav se zyada sabaka nahin he
 However, the World Cup will blossom as it progresses
 har baar kii tarah is vishwa cap main bhi chamatkaar or chaunkaau nateezon kii ummid lagaai ja sakati he
 Like the 39-year-old Rafael Marquez of Mexico, it could also be the All World Cup for many veteran footballers
 aaie, footbal ke is yuddh kaa bharpoor anand len
 Those moments of preparation when you imagine the staggering future of the future with old memories, live like a dream, that all eyes should shine on it

 lekin isamen sudhaar laane kii koshish karne kii bajaae sarkari doctor, adhikari or netaa aapas main bhid rahe hai
 For the last one month, government doctors have launched a movement against the Principal Secretary of Health Department
 in jhagadon ko nibatane main vyast swasthya mantri swasthya suvidhaon ko behatar karne ke liye kuch bhi nahin kar paa rahe
 The general public is crushing between all this
 bimaaru rajya ke kalank se mukti paa chukaa madhya pradesh swasthya suvidhaon ke morche par buree tarah pichad rahaa he
 a large number of doctors' posts are vacant here, the condition of government hospitals is poor and worse than that of Primary Health Centers (PHC) and Community Health Centers (CHC)
 central beuro of health intelegence ke mutabik, varsh 2012-13 main madhya pradesh ke kul 1,156 piechasi main keval 814 main doctor the or 333 siechasi main se keval 267 visheshgy the
 In fact, the doctors who are missing from the hospital for more than half the time and when in the hospital, refer the patient to another hospital
 aise main marij ke paas dar-dar bhatakane ke sivaa koi chaara nahin rah jaataa
 Director of Birla Hospital, Gwalior, Dr
 ravishankar daalamia kehete hai, ''yah samasya puure desh kii he
 Nobody fulfills their responsibility
 sabase zyada pareshaani imargency ilaaj ke dauraan aati he
 It is true that facilities are less in many government hospitals but in case of emergency, if treatment is available immediately, then the situation can be better
 iske liye isiu or cajmulti kii vyavasthaaon ko thik karnaa hoga
 Monitoring will also have to be improved
 ''sarkaar is sthiti se acchhee tarah waakif he
 Principal Secretary of Health Department, Praveer Krishna has started treating government doctors strictly for one and a half years
 lekin isse sthiti behatar hone kii bajaae or bighad gai
 Government doctors have opened a front against the principal secretary
 madhya pradesh chikitsa adhikari sangh mahakme se iees adhikariyon ko hataane kii maang kar rahaa he
 The president of the union, Dr
 ajay khare kehete hai, ''pramukh sachiv ke nirdesh vyaavhaarik nahin hai
 He says that the doctor will have to see 20 old and 25 new patients in OPD every day
 is duty ke baad doctor ko gaanv main jaakar aarogy kendron kaa nirikshan karnaa hoga
 Even many administrative tasks in the hospital have been handed over to the doctors
 ilaaj ke dauraan marij kii haalat gambhir ho jaati he to doctoron ke khilaaf kadi karrwai kii jaati he
 '' Dr
 khare aarope lagaate hai ki pradesh sarkaar ne 2008 main sarkari doctoron ko chaar stareey vetanman diya tha, jise ab waapas le liya gaya he or doctoron se vetan kii recovery shuru kar di he
 If the Sangh puts these issues before the government, a departmental inquiry is started by handing them a notice of breach of discipline
 jabaki pramukh sachiv praveer krishna kehete hai, ''yah sab vyavastha sudhaarney ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 State Health Minister Narottam Mishra is also stating the steps taken by the officers against the doctors as per rules
 ab sarkari doctor hadtaal par jane kaa man bana rahe hai, idhar sarkaar ise adaalat kii avmaananaa bataate hue kanoonee salaah le rahi he
 Shortage of doctors is a major problem
 pradesh ke 254 sarkari aspataalon main sarjan to hai lekin anaesthesia visheshgy nahin hai
 There are a total of 3,195 posts of specialist doctors in the state but only 1,063 of these posts have been filled
 prasuti rog, shishu rog or anaesthesia visheshgy ke 1,386 pad sweekrut hai lekin karyrat mahaj 419 hi hai
 Doctors do not want to do government jobs due to better pay and modern amenities in private hospitals
 2013 main pradesh sarkaar ne 1,320 doctoron kii bhartee kaa vigyaapan nikaala tha, lekin chaynit 825 doctoron main se keval 334 ne hi naukari jwine kii
 Madhya Pradesh is also lagging behind neighboring states in terms of health facilities
 masalan rajasthan main kul 1,528 piechasi main 1,755 doctor hai to maharashtra ke 1,811 piechasi main 2,760 doctor hai
 The state government gets bonds from doctors doing MBBS and PG, which makes it mandatory for them to work in villages for a fixed period
 lekin nae doctor iskaa bhi tod nikaal lete hai
 On the whole, bringing health services back on track is crooked
