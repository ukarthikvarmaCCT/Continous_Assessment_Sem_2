 Chidambaram (@pchidambaram_in)august 25, 2017 Baljit Parmar, a journalist who played a key role in sending Sanjay Dutt to jail in connection with keeping AK-56 at home, has refused to watch Sanju, a film on Sanjay Dutt's life
 unhone is film ko paise kamaane kaa ek madhyam qaraar diya he
 Posting Facebook, Baljeet wrote that "such biopic films made on any particular man or woman are not made to inspire people
" inkaa makasad us shaks kii vaastavik chhavi ko logon ke dimag se dhoomil karnaa hota he
 "sanju close to 200 crores in 6 days, rocking at the box office" "consuming drugs, sleeping with women, always blaming the system and society, deliberately sharpening myself in wrongdoings, on my old mistakes Not regretting it, taking the help of coercion and pretending to be pretentious if this is "sanju", then i have no regrets on my decision not to go to the film
 ''bataa den ki saal 1993 main mumbai ke ek akhbaar main kaam karne vaale balajit parmaar ne sanjay dutt ko lekar ek khabar brake kii thi
 In this, he accused Sanjay Dutt of possessing a dangerous weapon like AK-56
 isi ke paanch din baad jab sanjay dutt videsh se shooting kar ke laute to unhen giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Such trolling Hirani on Sanju, users said that the PR of 3 hours, after this, Sanjay Dutt was charged under TADA Act
 iske alaava arms act ke tahat wo doshi qaraar die gaye the or unhen 6 saal kii sajaa hui thi
 Film director Rajkumar Hirani made a film on the life of Sanjay Dutt in which Ranbir Kapoor played the character of Sanju Baba
 film ko darshakon dwaara kaaphi pasand bhi kiya ja rahaa he
 However, some people are opposing it and not placing it in the category of biopic

 film:gabbar ij bacretin2
 5 Stardirector: Krishaklakar: Akshay Kumar, Shruti Haasan, Suman Talwar and Sunil Grover 'gabbar' Aamir Khan's song that starts in the mind, 'dil Hai Ki Manta Nahin'
 aisa hi hamaara bollywood bhi he jo maanane ko taiyaar hi nahin he
 It does not have the heart to do something new
 bas isi ummid ke saath har shuukravaar ko ek film paros detaa he ki usne bahut mehnat kii he or film 100 karod ru
 Will cross the figure of 'gabbar ij back'bhi inhen iraadon ke saath banaai gai film he
 Akshay has been trying to convey his message with some of his previous films, whether it is 'baby', 'holiday' or now 'gabbar is Back'
 film kaa uddeshy acha he, lekin aisa lagata he ki diarector ne to dimag naa lagane kii kasam kha lee he, or unhen yah baat samaj hi nahin aa rahi he ki janata hoshiyaar ho gai he
 It cannot be recreated by remaking South
 film flo main chalati he, lekin har baat thunsi hui-si lagati he
 Everything seems to be seen
 vah bhi kai-kai baar
 How much of the story in the story Akshay Kumar is always the right path professor and his goal is to inspire and inspire the new generation to do something
 uski ladaai bhrashtachar se he
 But he has a past in which he loses his family due to the dishonesty of some people
 yahi uski ladaai kii asal vajah bhi he
 He moves towards the elimination of corrupt officials and becomes Gabbar
 kisi bhi bhrasht sarkari adhikari ko uske anjaam tak pahunchane main jhijakta nahin he
 The look of the film is very much like the films of South
 shaayad yah iske rimek hone kii vajah se ho saktaa he, lekin yah baat khalati he
 Has Bollywood become so pauper in terms of creativity? Star Appealfilm, as always in the case of Bollywood superstars, is made just for the hero
 aise main majaal he kisi or kairactor kii vah apana jalawaa yaa kaam dikhaa sake
 Akshay Kumar looks good
 aise role sirf vahi kar sakate hai
 Characterize
 lekin ab plis kuch nayaa karo
 Sunil Grover seems a bit strange as we have connected him more to the role of Gutthi
 lekin pulisavaale ke role main unhone acha kaam kiya he
 Shruti Haasan has to work very hard
 acting or dialog delivery par dhyaan dena hoga
 Main Villain Suman Talwar is the South Marca Villain
 kamai kii batsanjay lila bhansaali ne pichhali baar akshay kumaar ke saath 'roudi rathore' jaisi hit di thi
 The film was also a remake of South, but the flavors and one liners were fun
 yah eks factor 'gabbar' main missing he
 The music of the film is good
 film kaa bajet lagbhag 70 karod ru
 Being told jis tarah desh ke kisaanon ke khet mausam kii maar jhelkar behaal hai, usee tarah bhartiya box offis bollywood kii basirpair kii filmon kii vajah se haaf rahaa he
 It has high expectations from 'gabbar' but the film does not seem to be encouraging much
 bijepi kii karnataka ikai ke adhyaksh bies yediurppa ke khilaaf chal rahe bhrashtachar ke maamle main nayaa mode aa gaya he
 The Karnataka Administration Service official has written to the Governor and disclosed this
 adhikari ne apane patr main kaha he ki us par dabaav banaakar tatkaaleen mukhyamantri bies yediurppa ke khilaaf bayaan dene ke liye kaha gaya
 The officer said in the letter that he was threatened to make a statement and that he would be made a co-accused in the case for not doing so
 dakshin bharat main bijepi ke pehle CM yediurppabies yediurppa ek baar phir karnataka main bijepi kaa cheharaa hai
 Under his leadership, BJP first came to power in Karnataka in 2008
 dakshin bharat main bijepi kii yah pehali sarkaar thi
 However, in July 2011, Yeddyurappa had to resign from the post of Chief Minister after he was convicted in a report submitted by Lokayukta Santosh Hegde on illegal mining
 report main south west mining company se prerana trust ko 10 karod rupee milane or khanan company dwaara rachenhalli main 1
 The trust was asked to pay Rs 20 crore in exchange for purchasing 02 acres of land
 is trust kaa swaamitv or prabandhan yediurppa ke parivaar ke paas he
 Amit Shah's Karnataka tour was intended to infuse the state BJP unit divided into groups, with Amit Shah arriving on a three-day tour from August 12 and saying that the state BJP chief B

 The party, led by Yeddyurappa, is set to win the assembly elections
 shah ne jor diya tha ki party ekajute he or aagaamee dinon main yediurppa ke netritv main chunavi ladaai main utarane ke liye taiyaar he, dekhte rahiye ham rajya main bijepi kii sarkaar banaaenge
 Assembly elections are due in Karnataka early next year for which the party has set a target of winning more than 150 seats
 shah vibhinn staron par party ke logon se baatcheet karenge or ekajute rahane ke liye varisht netaaon ko bhi naseehat de sakate hai kyonki varisht netaaon ke bich haal tak khuleam aarope-pratyarope se party ko sharmindagi jhelni padi thi

 iraiya is mudde ko khuleam uchhaalate rahe hai jiske baad donon ko apane matbhedon kaa khuleam izhaar karne se manaa kiya gaya
 Shah said, i hope that due to the manner in which the party has been fighting against the Congress's policy of corruption, repression and polarization for the last five years, the people of the great state of Karnataka have decided to bring the BJP to power

 Rabia Girls Public School in Chandni Chowk area of delhi has been accused of providing 59 to 4 girls for non-payment of fees
 5 se 5 ghante tak skool ke basament main band rakhaa tha
 The government and the commission asked for the report, as the case grew, the Delhi government swung into action and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal sought a report on the entire matter

 parteners ko kai baar ye shaq ho jaataa he ki unke saathi kaa kisi or ke saath afaire chal rahaa he, is vajah se wo unase duuri bana rahaa he
 But the reason may be something else
 bhagdaud bhari jindagi bhi iskaa ek pramukh kaaran ho sakati he
 If your partner is becoming indifferent to intimate relationships, it is not necessarily with someone else
 ye bhi ho saktaa he ki vokuch duusari samasyaon main ulajhaa hoor isi vajah se antarang sambandhon se vimukh ho gaya ho
 There may be more reasons for affecting physical relationships: 1
 tanatogar aapako lag rahaa he ki aapkaa partner ab aapmen interest nahin le rahaa he to sabase pehle vajah jaanane kii koshish kiijie
 Stress also affects physical relationships
 aise samay main partner ke saath baithkar baat karnaa or uske tanaav ko kam karne kii koshish karnaa hi sabase sahi rahegaa
 2

 Relationships also arise due to fight-quarrelship-dispute and tension
 sex life ke prabhavit hone kii ye ek bahut badi vajah ho sakati he

 bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi is on a tour of Bihar
 unke pichley daure main bam dhamaakon main maare gaye logon ke pariwaron ko santvanaa dene ke liye
 This initiative of his has made the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's tirade
 ve un par tanaav badhane kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 There is no doubt that Modi is spreading his politics in a planned way and he sees this as a big opportunity
 lekin nitish kumaar ko kya hua, jo ve un peediton ke ghar na jaakar dilli main 14 dalon kii secularism baithak main bhaag lene pahunch gaye? apane rajya ke mukhyamantri hone ke naate unka yah ferj tha ki vah peediton ke ghar jate yaa vyaktigat doot bhejkar santvanaa dete
 He did not practice Rajdharma and tried to see his loss and harm
 apane secular card ko dikhaane kii koshish main ve pakshpaat par utar aae
 Perhaps he felt that those who died in Modi's rally are supporters of BJP and therefore they are not entitled to his sympathy
 lekin modi ne bhi is mudde ko uchhaalkar ise bahut bada bana diya or ek tarah se iskaa phayda uthaane kii koshish kii he
 It is an inappropriate behavior to see the death of innocents as an opportunity
 ise kisi tarah se sweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 But Modi is currently riding on the wings of the wind and he probably does not care about the just and unfair
 aise main fere politics kii ummid nahin kii ja sakati he
 The country is currently buzzing with the cacophony of politics where truth is seen to be a lie and lie is the biggest truth
 loktantr ke liye yah shubh sanket nahin he
 In which direction will the country go when the right people do not speak correctly on the right issues? Wrong issues and tug of war is not in anyone's interest
 bhartiya loktantr is samay ek aise doraahe par khadaa he jahaan se ek sadak manzil kii ore jaati he to duusari rasaatal kii ore, hamaare rajanetaaon ko inamen se sahi chunaav karnaa he
 India and Nepal have decided to install Global Positioning System (GPS) on each of the pillars of their border
 is aashay kaa faisla dehradun main 26-27 agast ko duusari bharat-nepal seemaa kaaryakari samooh (beadbluji) kii baithak main liya gaya
 It was decided in the meeting that the two countries would build 83 control units (control points) on their 1,880 km border and put GPS on all 8553 pillars along the border
 baatcheet main nepali paksh kaa netritv karne vaale surveykshan vibhaag ke mahanideshak madhusudan adhikari ne bataaya, "ek baar jeepies lagane ke baad in khambhon kii talash us sthiti main aasaan ho jaaegi jab kisi prakritik aapadaa main inhen nuksaan pahonchega yaa koi vyakti iskaa atikaraman karegaa
 " jeepies par donon deshon kii sahmati kii vajah khambhon ke apni jagah se idhar-udhar hone ke baad seemaa ke nirdhaaran ke mudde par uthne vaali chunauti he
 At present, there is a problem in deciding where these pillars were earlier
 adhikari ne kaha ki jeepies khambhon par sthai rup se lagaae jaaenge
 He said that the 83 control units (control points) to be built on both sides of the border will keep all information about the pillars on the border
 donon deshon ke bich seemaa par padane vaale nadiyon-naalon main or ghaney jangalon vaale someshwar main vishesh tarah ke khambhe lagane par bhi sahmati bani he
 The comments adhikari ke anusaar kul 8553 khambhon main se 1325 gaayab hai or 1956 kshatigrast avasthaa main hai
 He said, "we will replace the missing pillars with new pillars and paint the remaining ones with white paint
 " New guidelines were also set for the ADDJ level Survey Officers' Committee at the BWG meeting
 yah samiti jamini str par kaam karti he
 It deals with construction-repair-restoration and cleaning of 'no man's land' on both sides of the border (except Kalapani and Susta)
 baithak main tay kiya gaya ki donon desh apni 1,880 kilometre lambii seemaa par 83 niyantran ikai (control point) banaaenge or seemaa par lage sabhi 8553 khambhon par jeepies lagaayenge
 Madhusudan Adhikari, Director General, Survey Department, who led the Nepali side in the conversation, said, "once the GPS is installed, the search for these poles will be easier when they are harmed by a natural disaster or someone will encroach upon it
 " The reason for the two countries' consent on GPS is the challenge arising on the issue of border demarcation after the pillars move from their place

 gauratlab he ki twitor kaa bangaleru oparation america ke baad goosera sabase bada centre he or yahaan asia or latin america bazaar ko torget karke products develop kiye jate hai
 a Twitter statement on the matter said that this formal business review is a part and the company has decided to discontinue global engineering work from the Bangalore Development Center
 company ne kaha he, 'ham karmachariyon ke sahyog ke liye unka dhanyavad karte hai or twitor se unki sammanpurvak vidaai ke liye hamase jo ban padeg wo karenge'gauratlab he ki june 2016 tak duniya bhar main twitor ke 3,860 karmchaaree the
 However, Twitter has not told about how many employees the company has in India
 haalanki twitor ne yah bhi kaha he, 'aaj bharattvitor ke liye duniya bharamen sabase teji se badhane vaala bazaar he or ham yahaan audiens or yujar ingerement badhaane ke liye apane khaas pariyojnaon par nivesh karnaa jari rakhenge'
 For the last few days every issue other than sports is in discussion in Indian cricket
 coach-captain kii ladaai, ek nae coach ke liye captain kii jid, bade khilaadiyon kaa apmaan sabakuch
 But in the end, that is what captain Virat Kohli wanted
 ravi shastri ko bhartiya team kaa coach bana diya gaya, uske baad ravi shastri ko bhi puri chhot ke saath unki team chunane kaa adhikaar mila or bharat arun, shridhar team ke saath bataur gendbaaji or fielding coach ke rup main jude the
 But amid all this controversy, the BCCI made a big mistake
 bisisiai ne jis salaahkaar samiti ko cricket kaa sudhaar karne or bade faisle lene ke liye banaaya tha vah samiti sirf ek captain kii jid ke aage bauni sabit hui
 The BCCI has forgotten that if cricket is worshiped as a religion in India, one of the main reasons for this is that they are great cricketers
 anil kumble ke istife se lekar ravi shastri ke coach banane tak sabhi ne bharat ke mahanatam khilaadiyon ko khaarij hote hue dekha
 See who got rejected
 salaahkaar samiti khaarijaschin tendulkar, saurav ganguli or vivies lakshmana se saji salaahkaar samiti ko adhikaar tha ki vah cricket ke hit main koi bhi faisla le sakati he
 The committee had chosen Kumble as the coach last year, but later also decided to extend Kumble's term
 lekin dressing room main is tarah kaa maahaul banaaya gaya ki kumble ko apana istipha dena padaa
 2
 anil kumble khaariennil kumble bharat ke sarvshereshth gendbaajon main se ek hai, yahi kaaran tha ki unhen bhartiya team kaa coach banaaya gaya tha
 During his one-year tenure, Kumble also performed brilliantly as a coach, but because the captain and the team players were asked to follow a routine, that was not the reason for his captaincy
 or wo istipha dene ko majaboor hue
 Kumble also said in his resignation that perhaps the team did not like my approach
 3
 Virender Sehwag also dismissed Virender Sehwag, one of the great openers of India, was asked to apply for the coach position on behalf of the advisory committee
 lekin kyonki captain kohli shuru se hi shastri ko hi coach ke rup main chaahate the yahi kaaran rahaa he ki sahvaag ko tawjjo nahin di gai
 On the basis of which Sehwag was rejected in the interview, no clear reason has been given
 4
 zaheer-dravid also dismissed the Zaheer Khan and Rahul Dravid as the bowling and batting advisory coaches
 lekin shastri ne bisisiai se apni pasand kii team kii maang kii or bisisiai ne use puraa bhi kiya
 It is clear that Zaheer Khan, who took 610 wickets in his career, was overshadowed by Bharat Arun who took 6 wickets
 or jo rahul dravid bharat ke bhavishya ko tarashte hai vah bhi is dressing room main aane se kataraa rahe hai
 Dravid has said that he will not be able to travel with the team but will definitely help him by going to the camp
 saaf he ki rahul dravid, jahir khan, virendra sahvaag, sachin tendulkar, saurav ganguli, vivies lakshmana, anil kumble bhartiya cricket ke mahaan khilaadiyon main se ek rahe hai
 If ever there is talk of choosing India's dream team, then all these players will definitely be a part of that team based on their record and performance
 lekin shaayad BCCI ek captain or coach kii jid ke aage ye sab kuch bhula baitha

 or khabaron ke liye clic karen The CBI on Wednesday argued before the Special Court that former Telecom Minister a Raja had 'misled' the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on policy matters related to the allocation of 2G spectrum
 maamle main antim daleel dete hue vishesh lok abhiyojak anand grover ne kaha ki anya aropiyon ke saath sajeesh main raja ne tu ji license aavantnon main aaropee companiyon ke paksh main cat of taarikh aage badha di thi
 Grover contended that Raja allowed spectrum to be given to 'unqualified' companies like Swan Telecom Pvt Ltd (STPL) and Unitech Wireless (tamil Nadu) Ltd
 unhone kaha ki kuch aropiyon ke paksh main pehle aao pehle paao (epasatioes) niti badal di gai or raja ne tatkaaleen vidhi mantri kaa prastaav bhi khaarij kar diya, jinhone ahm nitigat maamalon ko mantriyon ke adhikarprapt samooh ke paas bhejne kii peshkash kii thi
 Citing a letter written by Raja to the then Prime Minister on November 2, 2007, Grover said, 'actually, he (raja) misled FCFS and Manmohan Singh on the cut-off date
 'abhiyojak ne kaha, dioti (doorsanchaar vibhaag) main adbhut chijen hui jisase pataa chalata he ki yah epasatioes (niti main badlaav) aropiyon ke paksh main jaanboojhkar kiya gaya
 In response to the attack on North Indians in Maharashtra, a woman officer of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) was attacked in Purnia district of Bihar for the reason that her surname is associated with Thackeray

 After this incident, Thackeray's security system has been increased on Saturday

 The Forest Research Institute (FRI) of Dehradun on Wednesday examined the Bodhi tree and found that it was in perfect condition
 ye gaya kaa wo hi bodhi ped he, jiske neeche baith kar 2500 saal pehle buddha ne tapasya kii thi
 Scientist Suresh Chandra examined this tree and said that the condition of the tree is fine and there is nothing to worry about
 isaki mrit shakhaon kii chantai kaa kaam visheshgy kii dekharekh main ho rahaa he, jisase ped kaa swasthya bana rahe
 Apart from this, those parts of the growing age of the tree are also being removed, in which fungus has taken place
 is pavitra vriksh ke swasthya jaanch kii pushti karte hue gaya ke dm sanjay agarwal ne bataaya ki unke paas abhi ped kii puri report aani baaki he
 After the poor condition of this sacred tree and a disease, its conservation and maintenance work was outsourced to the Forest Research Institute
 mandir prabandhan cameti or dehradun eparai ke bich samjhauta hone ke baad vahaan ke vaigyanik har chah maheene main ped kii jaanch ke liye yahaan pahunchate hai
 For the fungus in the tree, he said that it is being treated and it is normal
 ped ke biimaar hisson par aushadhiy paste laga diya gaya he
 He said that he also recommended pruning of trees every spring
 isse pehle vaigyanikon ne ped ke aasapaas shraddhaluon ke jane par bhi pabandi kii sifarish kii thi, jisase vriksh ke poshan channel band na ho or use nuksaan na pahunche
 Chandra said that this decision would have to be taken by the temple management committee
 najar mila naa sake khud se us nigaah ke baad, vahi he haal hamaara jo ho gunaah ke baad
 Only a three-over offense
 puri jindagi par baari pad gaya
 The stigma of just 18 balls was soaked in life
 har ne apane hisse kii chah-chah genden bechin
 The buyer bought all three overs for just one crore 40 lakhs
 magar aage unhone in teen overon ko teen sau karod main bech diya
 Yes yes hindustani cricket ke teen kalank ke teen over se satta bazaar ne lagbhag 300 karod kamaaye the, kyonki unhen in teen overon kaa anjaam pehle se pataa tha
 Read every ball of those three fix overs
 
 
 5 may ko jaipur kaa savai maan singh stadium or pune banaam rajasthan match
 Pune's team was the first to bat
 match shuru hone ja rahaa tha
 But before the match starts, a bookie calls Rajasthan spinner Ajit Chandelia
 phone par donon kii baatcheet hoti he
 But both did not know that Delhi Police is also listening to this conversation
 kyonki donon ke phone police ne april se hi servilans par laga rakhe the
 The deal was finalized
 buki khud maidan ke andar tha, kyonki saude ke hisaab se chandelia ko fiks over phenkane se pehle ishaara dena tha
 Gesture picking up his T-shirt
 par bahut mumkin tha ki chandelia jab ishaara karata to camera chandelia par naa hota
 That is why the bookie himself was sitting in the field
 taaki over shuru hone se pehle wo chandelia kaa ishaara apni ankhon se dekh sake
 So that after that the betting rate can be opened on that over
 
 Before proceeding, understand what a fix over means here? The deal here is for Chandelia to give at least 14 runs in an over
 14 se zyada ran de de to koi fark nahin padataa
 But should not be less than 14 runs
 ab sochie, buki ko pataa he ki chandelia ke over main 14 ran se kam nahin jane
 Apparently, if you bet, then the person who does not know how many runs will be scored in this over? That means his defeat is certain
 jabaki buki kaa maalamaal hona tay, kyonki use to over shuru hone se pehle hi over kaa anjaam pataa he
 Well, the deal was done
 puure chalis lakh main
 The deal to throw an over i
e
 six balls and give 14 runs in those six balls
 match kaa pehla over chandelia phenkata he
 This over was fine as the deal was about Chandelia's second over
 wo match kaa teesraa over tha or chandelia kaa doosraa over
 First ball of Chandelia
 legstump ke baahar
 But the runs remained the same
 duusari gend, wo bhi legstump ke baahar
 Robin Uthappa gave him a four
 teesri gend
 There was a short ball at the off stump
 aasaan gend par phir chaukaa
 The fourth ball was Goodlength and something better
 koi ran nahin
 After this, one run on the fifth ball
 ab tak paanch gend par das ran hi bane the
 The bet is 14 runs
 ye baat chandelia bi jaanata tha
 So this is the sixth ball thrown
 leg said par behad kharaab gend
 Finch very easily hit him
 shart puri ho gai
 Chandelia had conceded 14 runs in his second over
 is ek over ke liye match se pehle chandelia ko 40 lakh main se peshgi ke taur par 20 lakh mil chuke the
 But Chandelia made a mistake
 over shuru karne se pehle wo shart ke mutabik apni tii-shart uthaa kar buki ko signal dena bhul gaya tha
 Now that he did not give the signal, the bookie did not open the bet on that over
 kyonki buki ko laga ki shaayad chandelia sauda bhul gaya he yaa kuch or gadabadi ho gai he
 So Chandelia had to return the money
 par ye to shuruyaat thi
 Now it was the turn of the next match
 agle khilaadi kii
 The next deal was also 40 lakhs
 pehla over 40 lakh main nipat chukaa tha
 Now the deal was to be second over
 phir se 40 lakh main deal hui
 But this time the bowler changed
 abaki sauda team india ke purv tej gendbaaj es shrishanth ke saath hua tha
 Sreesanth was to give 14 runs in his second over and to indicate that he was giving 14, he had to put a towel in his pants
 taaki buki deal pakki samajhe
 Read Sreesanth's second over sold for 40 lakhs
 9 may, mohali, punjab banaam rajasthan- is baar bhi team rajasthan kii thi
 But the contest was against Punjab
 match se pehle is baar buki chandelia ko nahin balki team india ke purv tej gendbaaj es srisanth ko phone karata he
 Like the first time, this time too, there is a deal to fix the second over of the bowler
 is baar bhi ek over main kam se kam 14 ran lutaaney kaa sauda hota he
 This time too, before the start of the over, the bowler is instructed to signal
 buki do baaten kahata he
 The first is that Sreesanth will wrap his second over with a towel in his pants and the second is that before throwing the over, he will take some time by exercising, so that the bookie gets time to open the quote
 shrishanth aisa hi karata he
 He does the first over with no towels
 magar iske baad match kaa chauthaa over aata he
 That is Sreesanth's second over
 vahi over jo book he
 40 lakhs
 shrishanth ko is over main 14 yaa usase zyada ran dene hai
 Under the deal, when Sreesanth comes to put the second over, hang the towel in the pants
 yani wo buki ko ishaara kar chukaa tha
 The bookie had opened the door
 srisanth ke fiks duusare over kii pehali gend
 Shot ball outside off stump
 shrishanth ne mauka diya tha par ballebaaj thik se khel nahin paaya
 Therefore no runs were scored
 duusari gend
 Overpitch
 aasaan gend
 Four runs
 teesri gend
 This too outside the off stump
 par ballebaaj iskaa phayda nahin uthaa paaya
 Fourth ball
 short uthati hui
 But the batsman could not pull properly again
 lihaaja chakka yaa chauke kii jagah sirf ek ran mili
 Sreesanth is breaking his hair
 paanchavin gend
 Now on the leg side
 kharaab gend
 Four runs
 paanch gend par ab tak nau ran ban chuke the
 Fours on the sixth ball
 sauda 14 ran kaa tha
 Went on 13
 kyonki ballebaaj srisanth kii koshish ke baavjood ran hi nahin le paae
 But according to the deal Sreesanth still got 40 lakhs
 kyonki buki kaa kaam ho chukaa tha
 And with this, the work of Delhi Police was done now
 magar police chaahati thi ki khilaadi kuch or galati karen taaki wo unhen aasaani se pakad saken
 And coincidentally, on May 15, six days after this match, a third player gave this opportunity to the Delhi Police
 teesri deal 60 lakh kii thi
 And the special thing was that this time this deal itself was done by one player with another player
 buki ke kehane par
 So you saw two overs sold for 80 lakh rupees
 ab baari tisare bikaoo over kii thi
 But this third over sold for 60 lakhs this time
 darasal ye teesraa over bhi ajit chandelia hi phenkata
 But just before the match it was revealed that Chandelia was not in the team
 uski jagah ankit chouhan khel rahaa he
 So this time the bookie signed Ankit with Chandelia
 ab 60 lakh rupye kaa teesraa over ankit phenkane ja rahaa tha
 May 15, Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai, Mumbai vs Rajasthan - This match was very important for both Rajasthan and Mumbai to be at the top two position in the playoffs
 par is match main ajit chandelia nahin khel rahaa tha
 He was replaced by new spinner Ankit Chauhan
 ye baat buki ko bhi pataa thi
 So the bookie made Ajit Chandelia his pawn and entrusted him with the responsibility of fixing an over from Ankit Chauhan
 chandelia ne ankit se deal kiya

 com / ouox6khoqt water tanker or premium bas ghotaale ke baad ab bijepi ne hai security number plate kii kharid or use lagane main hui gadabadiyon ke maamle main gher liya he
 The BJP alleges that the company which installed the high security number plate, along with the people of the government, has done a scam of four hundred and fifty crore rupees
 sharton ke mutabik kaam nahin kar rahi thi companybijepi kaa aarope he ki 49 din kii sarkaar ke dauraankejariwal sarkaarko hai security number plate lagane vaali company rosemerta kii gadabadiyon kii jaankaree mil gai thi or tab kii sarkaar ne ek fact finding cameti bhi banaai thi
 In the report of this committee, the company was found guilty of supplying inferior number plates
 saath hi agreement kii sharton ke mutabik kaam nahin karne kii doshi bhi pai gai thi
 The companies did not pay five times the market rate, the committee also wrote in its report that the company charged Rs 1200 per plate for the number plate of cars, which was up to five times the fixed rates
 dilli bijepi ke pravaktaa harish khurana ke mutabikareport main gadabadi ujagarhone ke baad bhi company kaa kantract radd nahin kiya gaya, balki duusari baar satta main aane ke baad bhi company kaa contract kejariwal sarkaar ne jari rakhaa
 Rs 450 crore scam: Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana said that Rs 450 crore scam has taken place in 15 months
 ye paisa yaa to company kii jeb main gaya yaa phir aam aadmi party ke logon kii jeb main
 It should be investigated
 ye ghotaalaa he, kyonki sarkaar ko gadabadiyon kaa na sirf pataa tha, balki khud inaki banaai cameti kii report main ye sabit bhi ho gaya tha
 In this case, Delhi Minister for Transport Satyendra Jainka says that he has recently taken over the department
 isliye unako puure maamle kii jaankaree nahin he, lekin jaldi hi wo is bare main pataa karenge
 The minister may be unaware, but according to the report of the Fact Finding Committee of the Delhi government, we have - in 2012 during the Congress government for the high security number plate
 - march 2012 main macers rosemerta hai security registration plate ventures privet limited ko gadiyon par hai security number plate lagane kaa kaam mila
 - The government received many complaints against this company
 - 49 din kii sarkaar ke dauraan sarkaar ne is contract ko lekar ecoffact finding cametibana di
 - On 31 January 2014, the Fact Finding Committee gave its report
 is report ke mutabik -- concesanair company affpruved or anweryphid sorce se hai security number plate le rahi thi
 Because of this, it was feared that these number plates could be inferior
 - number plate aise centaron se lagaai ja rahi thim, jo transport vibhaag se apruved nahin the
 - Overcharging was being done from the vehicle owners in lieu of the number plate
 (car ke liye 1200 rupee tak or do pahiyaa vaahanon ke liye 600 rupee vasule ja rahe the
 Which ranged from three to six times
 )- cameti ko automotive research association of india ko 15 janvari ko patr mila, jiske mutabik rosemerta kii sahyogi company utsav sefti system limited ke conformity of production yani COD certificate hold par daal die gaye the
 The Fact Finding Committee also wrote in its report that due to lack of expertise and lack of infrastructure, it could not investigate many technical shortcomings of the company
 isliye isaki jaanch kisi export cameti se karaayi jaae
 Now BJP is questioning the government that, after the fact finding committee report, the company contract was not canceled
 - overcharging kaa paisa ricover nahin kiya gaya
 Which was about Rs 450 crore during 15 months
 company ne 200 rupee kii plate 1200 main lagaai
 Number plates are put on 3 lakh trains every month
 agar is hisaab se dekha jaae, to 15 maheene main aankada 450 karod par pahunchataa he
 In whose pocket did this money go? - Due to similar disturbances, the government of Madhya Pradesh and Sikkim had canceled the contract of high security number plate
 - sarkaar kaa kahana he ki company ke saath arbitreshan main he, lekin arbitreshan main contract radd karne ke baad janaa chahie tha
 Obviously, for the Kejriwal government, which is facing allegations of disturbing the premium bus scheme and suppressing the tanker scam file, the opposition can also cause trouble on this issue

 India has announced its squad for the tour of the West Indies
 team kaa jo chayan kiya gaya he usamen se do baaten samaj main aa rahi hai, sabase badi baat he ki captain viraat kohli teenon formet main khilne vaale hai
 The Indian captain who was being told that he is probably not going to visit the West Indies and is going to take a little rest, but Virat decided to go to the West Indies, not only stopping all these news but also all three formats
 Will play aakhir viraat ke liye wo kaaran kya the jisaki vajah se viraat ko yah faisla lenaa padaa
 The biggest reason is that India lost in the semi-finals in the World Cup, while it was being considered as a contender for the cup
 doosraa kaaran isse bhi bada he ki puure vishwa cap main viraat kohli ke balle se ek bhi shatak nahin aayaa keval paanch ardh shatak hi ve bana paae jabaki rohit sharma ne paanch shatak laga die
 After this, if Virat Kohli did not go to the West Indies, Rohit Sharma would have been made the captain
 vaise bhi vanade or tii-20 main ek lobby rohit sharma ko captain banane kii vakaalat kaaphi dinon se kar rahi he
 Even though all these people are associated with Mumbai cricket, they have a point
 khaskar tii-20 kii captaini ko lekar
 The Mumbai Indian has won the IPL four times under Rohit's captaincy, while RCB, under the leadership of Virat Kohli, has not won a single champion
 ek or daleel di jaati he ki viraat kohli balle se apane aalochakon ke jawaab dena chaahate hai kyonki vishwa cap main apane prardashan se ve khush nahin the or west indies kii team jis haalat main he, viraat yah mauka nahin chhodana chaahate hai
 After all, they are also following the record of Master Blaster Sachin Tendulkar
 ab sabaki nigahen hongi viraat or rohit kii ballebaaji par
 This is a competition in which everyone will be interested
 west indies jane vaali team main dhoni kaa na hona bhi ek bahut badi khabar he
 The selectors have made it clear that Dhoni has not been removed from the team but has taken leave from cricket for a few days
 magar sabase bada sawaal he ki dhoni ke liye aage kaa rasta kya he? itnaa to tay he ki dhoni tii-20 kaa vishwa cap agle saal jarur khelenge kyonki sutron kii maane to viraat ne chayankartaaon se is bare main baat bhi kar lee he
 Now the biggest question is how successful Dhoni is playing cricket till then
 westeindies ke baad tii-20 kii chaar siries lagaataar bharat main honi hai dakshin africa, bangladesh, west indies or zimbabwe ke saath
 While India will play a five-match T20 series with New Zealand at his home
 aise main 12 gharelu tii-20 maichon main bharat kii jameen par dhoni ko sabit karnaa hoga ki world cap kii team kaa hissaa ho sakate hai
 In fact, the selectors are leaving the decision to Dhoni not pressing for his retirement, as was done with Sachin Tendulkar
 ab faisla dhoni ke haath main he ki ve world cap ke baad sanyas lete hai yaa nahin
 Dhoni is also under pressure from Chennai Super King to remain in the T20 Indian team till 2020 as he has a contract with Chennai Super King till 2020 and much will depend on the performance made in the IPL
 itnaa to tay he ki bhartiya cricket main dhoni kaa kad itnaa bada he ki koi un par faisla thope nahin saktaa, unhen khud hi apane karier kaa faisla karnaa hoga
 This time i would definitely like to mention one player selected in ODI and T20 team, that is Navdeep Saini of Rajasthan
 tej gendbaaj saini gautam gambhir kii khoj hai jinhen net par gend phenkane ke liye bulaayaa gaya tha
 Saini throws the ball at a speed of 150 km
 ipel main royal chalanger ke liye khelte hai isliye viraat kii najar main bhi hai, magar sabase badi kahani yah he ki ek vakt main navdeep saini mahaj 200 rupee main karnal main tenil ball toornament khilne jaaya karte the
 Two cousins are also in the team Deepak Chahar and Rahul Chahar
 deepak swing gendbaaj hai
 He has also played one ODI and one T20 and currently plays IPL for Chennai
 jabaki rahul chote hai or leg brake gugali gendbaaj hai
 Played for Pune in 2017, Dhoni helped

 There are a few hours left for the Karnataka election results
 congress or bijepi donon bahumat kaa daawa kar rahi he
 Meanwhile, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah says that the Congress will remain in power and said that this is his last election
 darasal agar congress karnataka main satta bachaane main kaamyaab rahati he to party bhale hi ise rahul kii ranneeti se jodakar dikhaane kii koshish karegi
 But like Punjab, the party will win but the credit will go to Siddaramaiah like Amarinder
 jaise ki punjab chunaav main congress kii jeet ko tamaam tarkon ke saath rahul gandhi se jodne kii koshish hui thi
 But all the experts in politics have clearly stated that even though the victory has been done by the Congress, the credit goes to Amarinder Singh only and only, the people of Punjab have voted for Amarinder
 karnataka main bhale hi sonia gandhi, congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ormallikarjun khadgene tamaam reliyaan kin
 But there are meaningful arguments behind m Siddaramaiah's claim in Karnataka
 karnataka kii janata ke saamne keval siddharmaiya kaa cheharaa tha
 Not only this, those issues were contested by Siddaramaiah in the last 5 years for Karnataka
 agar chunaav main congress kii ranneeti dekhi jaae to usne kaaphi had tak siddharmaiya ko free hand diya
 Be it the issue of granting separate religion status to Lingayat or the politics of Kannada identity, Siddaramaiah took every step as per his strategy
 unhone is chunaav ko sthaneey banaam bahari banane main bhi koi kasar nahin chodi or ve lagaataar piem modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah par hamale karte rahe bajaay ki bijepi ke siem candidet yediurppa se ulajhane ke
 Not only this, Siddaramaiah remained in the field alone to compete with the opposition
 har chunaav main siddharmaiya ke nishane par bijepi ke siem ummidavaar bi es yediurppa or piem modi the
 Siddaramaiah was seen fighting the battle in social media along with election rallies from both alone
 siddharmaiya se mukaable ke liye bijepi ko karnataka main kai baar ranneeti bhi badalani padi
 In such a situation, if the people of Karnataka have voted for 'hath', then Siddaramaiah's face is in front of them, and Siddaramaiah also knows them well
 agar chunaav ke baad party kobahumatamiltaa he to congress unhen shrey de yaa naa de, wo ise chhinakar apane haq main kar lenge
 Why Nki people of Karnataka with them
 gauratlab he ki karnataka congress main dalit siem ke naam par charchaa joro par he
 Siddaramaiah himself also said that if the party makes a Dalit a CM, then he is ready to give up the chair
 lekin saath hi siddharmaiya ne ye bhi daanv chal diya he ki ye unka aakhri chunaav he
 Senior CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechury said on Friday that if Maoists abandon the path of violence and adopt the methods of democracy, they will be the first to talk to them
 nepal main ati vamapanthiyon ke saath vaarta kii madhyastha karne vaale yechuri par maovadiyon ke masale par dohare maandand apnaane ke mamata ke aarope par unhone kaha ki unhone nepali maovadiyon ke bare main vichaar karnaa tab shuru kiya jab unhone hinsa chhod di or loktantric raah par laut aae
 He told reporters, 'this cannot be compared
 nepali maovadiyon ne hathiyaar tyaag die or lotantric rasta apanaaya
 Only then did i talk to him
 ’ yechuri ne kaha, ‘bhartiya maovadiyon ko bhi hinsa kaa rasta chhodane dijie
 No point of conversation without it
 unhen hinsa chhodane dijie or unase baatcheet karne vaala pehla aadmi main hounga

 In today's time, most people have back pain and many times it happens that the exact reason is not known
 kuch logon ko lagata he ki vitamin di kii kami ke chalate peeth main dard he, kuch kaa lagata he ki sahi se na so paane ke kaaran aisa ho rahaa he
 On the other hand, some percentage of back pain patients believe that calcium deficiency is the reason
 ek dharna yah bhi he ki bahut adhik kaam karne se bhi peeth dard hota he
 These are all possible causes of back pain
 kai baar stone kii samasya hone par bhi peeth main dard bana rahata he lekin haal hi main peeth dard kii ek behad rochak vajah saamne ai he
 According to Sophia Kapse, a holistic therapist, the cause of back pain is more emotional than physical
 capse ke mutabik, peeth kaa dard hamen bachapan se hi hota he or chipa rahata he lekin jab ham bade ho jate hanto vah bad jaataa he or phir use bardaasht kar paanaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 Kapse also gives a reason for this that due to negative behavior or any negative thing, acid accumulates in our muscles
 yah dard ke liye jimmedaar hota he
 This style of Kapse is quite unique
 wo Langellotti tri-therapy ke tahat kaam karti hai
 Many stars of this therapy are murid

 uske baad vah un jagahon par dabaav daalati hai or massage karti hai or yah jaanane kii koshish karti hai ki aakhir mansapeshiyon main marod kii vajah kya he
 There is a thinking behind this whole treatment
 theory ke mutabik, jab ham kisi troma se guzarate hai to hamaari mansapeshiyon ko dhakka lagata he
 The more we go through stress, the more adrenalin and cortisol come out in our body which is converted into lactic acid
 isse sensori nerve prabhavit hoti hai or dard punap jaataa he

 Siddaramaiah tweeted, 'I am often told that history is against me because for a long time no government in Karnataka has been elected again
 lekin ham yahaan itihaas rachane ke liye hai, na ki uskaa paalan karne ke liye
 On the other hand, the main rival BJP of the Congress left no stone unturned to ensure that history is repeated

 Today is a critical day for the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as the Election Commission has recommended disqualification of 20 of its mlas in the matter of profit post to President Ram Nath Kovind
 agar kovind is sifarish ko maan lete hai to dilli se 20 sadasyon kii sadsyta chali jaaegi
 In this case, the number of AAP party mlas in the 70-member Delhi Assembly will come down from 66 to 46 directly
 vidhayak kapil sharma baagi ho chuke hai
 While Kumar Vishwas is angered by not being sent to the Rajya Sabha and is told that he has the support of around 10 mlas, he can change his seat, given the opportunity
 aisa hone parkejariwal sarkaarper sankat barkaraar rahegaa
 On the other hand, the Bharatiya Janata Party has 4 mlas
 7 farvari, 2015 ko vidhansabha chunaav karaae gaye the jisamen arvind kejariwal ke netritv main party ne aitihaasik jeet hasil kii thi
 The AAP accused the Election Commission of bias, the opposition demanded Kejriwal's resignation, though the AAP party announced to go to the High Court following the Election Commission's recommendation
 aane vaale samay main dilli kaa raajnneetik ghatnakram behad romaanchak hone vaala he, dekhnaa hoga ki yahaan kii raajnneeti kis taraf ruukh karti he
 bjp-congress in Firaq! On the other hand, if the President accepts this recommendation, then the membership of 20 members will be lost, in such a situation there will be a re-election environment in Delhi
 in siton par chunaav hone kii sthiti main bhartiya janata party or congress ke paas dilli vidhansabha main apni sthiti behatar karne kaa mauka mil saktaa he
 After ruling for 15 consecutive years, the Congress suffered a crushing defeat in 2013 and was reduced to 8 seats
 baagi tevar se sankat main sarkaar!22 janvari ko ritair hone se pehle apane aakhri kaary diwas par mukhya chunaav ayukta eke jyoti ne 20 sadasyon kii sadsyta khaarij kiye jane kii sifarish kar di
 The AAP party will take this decision to the court, while the BJP and the Congress will want the President to take a decision on it soon and the whole situation becomes completely clear
 duusari taraf aap party apane vidhayakon ke baagi tevar ko lekar kaaphi pareshaan he
 Many big party members have left together in the last 3 years or are in the process of leaving
 mukhyamantri kejariwal ke saamne ek dikkat or he ki ve khud apane 4 mantri ko hataa chuke hai, mauka dekhakar ve bhi baghawat kaa daaman tham sakate hai
 In case of rebellion of 4 removed ministers and the membership of 20 mlas, the majority figure will come down to 42
 vahiin party se naaraaz chal rahe kumaar vishwaas ke bare main mana ja rahaa he ki unke paas kareeb 10 vidhayakon kaa samarthan hai or mauka dekhte hue vah paala badal sakate hai
 Congress's b team is Aam Aadmi Party: Manoj Tiwari After this, elections were held in 2015, then this time Congress could not even open its account
 jabaki satta main vaapasi kii wat johne vaali bhaajapa mahaj 3 seat par hi jeet hasil kar saki
 Later, another seat was added to his account
 rajouri garden seat se aap vidhayak janrail singh ne punjab se vidhansabha chunaav main ladane ke liye istipha de diya tha
 Then in the by-election this seat went to the BJP
 aap kaa 2014 main daanv rahaa naakaam4 disambar, 2013 ko hue chunaav main bhaajapa ko aas thi ki vah satta main lautegi, lekin trishanku vidhansabha ne uske armaanon par pani pher diya
 It emerged as the top party in the state by securing 31 seats, but the Congress, which won 8 seats, gave its support to the AAP party winning 28 seats, which led Arvind Kejriwal to form the government
 haalanki yah sarkaar mahaj 49 din hi chal saki kyonki kejariwal ne janalokapal bill paas nahin kar paane kii naakaami ko sweekaarte hue istipha de diya
 It was said that Kejriwal was excited about the electoral success in Delhi and wanted to win the 2014 general election, but this time he failed
 kareeb ek saal ke intjaar ke baad dilli ne phir se vidhansabha chunaav (2015) dekha or is baar aap party ne saare kayaason ko dhata bataate hue 70 main se 67 seat apane naam kar lee
 The BJP and the Congress were left as mere spectators
 kejariwal ne banpar bahumat ke saath apane dam par duusari baar sarkaar bana lee
 This victory of AAP did not impress the big parties
 No such national party has won such a big victory of a newly fledged party like AAP in the national capital
 bich-bich main aisi khabaren aati raheen ki bade raajnneetik dal aap sarkaar ko giraane kii firaaq main rahen
 But the situation never went in his favor
 raajnneetik halkon main charchaa yah bhi rahi ki party ke baagi vidhayak kapil mishra ke dam par vipakshi dal aap sarkaar ko giraanaa chaahate the, par kamyaabi nahin mili
 However, in the meantime, the AAP government made a mistake in March 2015, which the party may have to lose
 kejariwal sarkaar ne 21 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv ke pad par niyukt kar diya
 On whom, a lawyer named Prashant Patel complained to the President, stating the office of profit and demanded the termination of membership of these mlas
 phir yaheen se vipakshi dalon ko ek mauka mil gaya ki is bahaane vidhayakon ko ayogy kar sarkaar ke banpar bahumat ko kuch had tak kam kiya jaae
 In the case of the post of profit of about 3 years old, the officials of the Election Commission have kept it till now
 lekin vartmaan mukhya chunaav ayukta eke jyoti ne saahas dikhaaya or apane ritair se pehle is maamle par faisla lenaa vaazib samajha
 The local bodies have lost in the elections, the AAP party's poor performance in the local bodies in Delhi is also troubling them
 pichley saal april main hue chunaav main uttari dilli nagar nigam main bhaajapa ko 64 seat mili jabaki aap ko 21 seat hasil hui
 At the same time, in the South Delhi Municipal Corporation, BJP got 70 seats and AAP got 16 seats while Congress got 12 seats
 yahi haal purvi dilli nagar nikaay chunaav main hua, jahaan bhaajapa ko 47, aap ko 13 or congress ko 3 siten hasil huin
 The BJP won a majority in the Delhi Municipal elections for the third time in a row under the AAP party government
 20 vidhayakon kii sadsyta jane kii surat main dilli main upachunaav karaae jaaenge hi
 At the same time, if all these situations of the above converge, then the existence of a new government can be a crisis and Delhi may face a new election, now it is time

 purv vitt mantri ne kaha ki agar videsh mantri ne maanavtaa ke aadhaar paralalit modi kii madadki to vah unhen bhartiya ucchayog main arji daalane ke liye bhi kah sakati thim
 Why the government did not ask Lalit Modi to come back to India
 sarkaar ko yah sunishchit karnaa chahie ki lalit modi bharat aae or phir unke khilaaf aaropon kii idi dwaara jaanch ho
 Red Corner can issue notice EDED sources said that the process of action against Lalit Modi, accused of money laundering, will proceed soon

 The ED is now awaiting the green signal to issue a red corner notice

 We managed to convince them to come down in the batting order and they understood that this was right for the team and for that
 hamen sabhi chizon ko dekhnaa padataa he
 The captain said, 'kohli is the kind of player who runs fast
 agar koi tisare number par acha kar rahaa he or viraat bhi chauthe number par sahaj he to phir aisa kyon nahin kiya jaae
 Carry on with it
 lekin yah pehali baar kiya gaya isliye dekhte hai ki kya hota he
 Rayudu was also praised for his batting at number three in place of Ambati Rayudu who played a useful innings of 32 runs

 Mallya and his two companies — the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines (KFA) and its holding company United Breweries Holdings — were willfully declared defaulters
 desh ke sabase bade bank se maano is ishaare kaa intjaar kar rahe baaki bainkon ke liye bhi ab had puri ho chuki thi
 In March, the State Bank of India, along with 16 other banks, filed an appeal in the Karnataka High Court to arrest the businessman and seize his passport
 is bich karj recovery tribunel ne british sharaab company diegio se kaha ki vah maalya ko company se alag hone ke evaj main 515 karod ru
 Do not give the package until the case is decided against them
 is maamle kii sunwaayee 28 march ko hone vaali he
 In another development, the Enforcement Directorate also raised Rs 900 crore taken by KFA from IDBI
 ke karj main sibiai kii jaanch ke aadhaar par maalya ke khilaaf mani-londering kaa maamla darj kar liya
 Mallya went out of the country on 2 March, panicked by the scrutiny of various agencies and strict court proceedings
 mileebhagat kaa maamla?haalanki kai logon ko maalya kii kaalpanik udaanon ke liye dhan uplabdh karaane main bainkon kii bhoomika badi pareshaan karne vaali lagati he
 J
, a former Sebi director and banker who controls capital markets
 en
 Gupta says, "how did it happen that banks failed to realize the flaws of KFA?" This airline company was doing very well in terms of both market share and load factor at one time but after that it started working like a beer company
 ”ek airline company kisi bear company kii tarah tadak-bhadak se kaam nahin kar sakati jiske liye brand pramotion or edwartiging kaaphi ahmiyat rakhte hai
 Perhaps the biggest reason for Mallya's business being snapped up was the Air Deccan deal that he bought for licensing international flights
 bhartiya niyamon ke mutabik sirf unheen vimaan companiyon ko videsh ke liye udaanen sanchalit karne kii ijaajat he jo gharelu sevaaon main paanch saal puure kar chuki hon
 It was named the low-rent Kingfisher Red
 aakhirkaar, kul milakar 8,200 karod ke nuksaan, or vetan va hawaii addon ke bakaae ke saath is airline ko 2012 main band kar diya gaya
 Due to this, an allegation on Mallya is that he has invested a lot of money in the airline business of the rest of his companies
 maalya kii united spirits main 2014 main niyantrak hissedari akhriyaar kar lene vaali company diegio ke auditoron ne paaya ki maalya ne kathith taur par uske 7,200 karod ru
 Turned to the airline, which was then put into another item
 iske alaava group kii company united bruvarij se bhi kathith taur par 1,300 karod ru
 Investigations are being carried out against them for being dishonest
 ek or aarope yah bhi he ki maalya lagaataar vyavastha ko naak chidhaane vaala kaam kar rahe the
 On one hand, their airline was shutting down, their staff was not getting salaries and their liabilities combined with interest was Rs 9,000 crore
 ho gai thim, par unki shanoshaukat main koi fark nahin padaa
 At one time, the former chairman of a state-owned bank that gave loans to Mallya but recovered the entire amount on time, had the question, "how can it be that you are the debtor of such a huge amount and spend your life with such chaos
 Should people think that you are blowing money? ”of course the mistake was also with the banks
 arthvyavastha ke ucch vikaas vaale daur main sarkari bank karj dete rahane ke mood main the
 They were giving loans to large projects but in most cases were not assessing the losses and losses of these businesses
 unke paas aisi tamaam pariyojnaon kaa moolyankan karne ke liye na to log the or na hi ichha
 As a result, many debts went down
 ek banker kaa kahana tha, “esbiai caps yaa isiisiaai bank sareekhe bahut kam hi sanghathan the jo kisi pariyojna ke vistaar main jaakar uski karj-upyuktata kaa akalan kar sakate the
 Lending was rarely done on the basis of the credit of the borrower
 ”korporate adwijuri form ican investment adwisers ke chairman anil singhvi kehete hai, “agar 2006 ke baad se kai saal ke liye aapaki vikaas dar bahut acchhee rahi to aisi dhan kii aasaan uplabdhta kii vajah se tha
 Although this money belonged not to "bankers", but to "moneylenders" because if they were bankers, they would also know how to recover their money
 aisa kyon he ki nijee kshetra main enpie shunya ke baraabar he? kya unke paas baahar se dabaav nahin hota?”isi vyavastha main us nyaayik pranali ko bhi jod dijie jo khudara karjadaaron par to bahut sakht he lekin ve bade korporate ko chutta ghoomane kii ijaajat detii rahati he
 The banker above said, "in the case of retail borrowers, the Credit Information Bureau of India keeps a full account of the debt status of individual borrowers and warns the banks in advance of a person's credit
 ”vyavastha main khamiyanisse gambhir sawaal khadey hote hai
 Is it that the banks have deliberately closed their eyes on the problems being done by the owners? Were they deliberately lax in taking action against such businessmen? When Mallya started discussing with a group of borrowers to provide funds to his airline in 2010, the bankers were divided on the issue
 haalanki bahumat se faisla yahi hua ki unase 1,500 karod ru
 After receiving personal guarantee, funds should be made available afresh
 karjadaaron ne unki sampattiyon kii suchi bhi hasil kii
 Thus Mallya raised a total of Rs 1,500 crore
 mulya ke sheyaron, real estate, or anya parisampattiyon kaa vivaran de diya
 Says Gupta, "the bankers had to take a decision on that occasion and they decided to lend
" ab dekhen to yah ek kharaab faisla tha
 "now it will be known from the new investigation whether he took this decision under any external pressure or he had any connivance with the defaulters
 esbiai ne yah spasht kiya he ki usne keefee se karj vaapasi ke liye sabhi uplabdh sansadhano kaa istemaal kiya or is maamle main uski taraf se koi dhilaai nahin rahi
 This is not so special! Mallya categorically denies any collusion with bankers
 haal hi main ek khule patr main unhone kaha ki keefee ko esbiai capital markets or prakhyat antarrashtriya uddyan salaahkaaron ke majboot bijness plan ke akalan ke aadhaar par hi shuru kiya gaya tha
 But despite all efforts, he failed due to economic reasons and government policies
 unhone kaha, “kingfisher airline or bahari karkon se vittiya dabaav kii asaliyat esbiai ne 31 janvari, 2012 ko rigerv bank ko bheje patr main saaf kar diya tha
 "he has also stated that he is not a single defaulter and no other big defaulters have been disclosed
 unhone bataaya ki ve bainkon ke faisle ko court main chunauti de chuke hai
 The Supreme Court on February 16, 2016 directed the Reserve Bank of India to provide details of the companies that had deposited Rs 500 crore in sealed envelopes in six weeks
 se zyada ke karj kii adaayagi main chook kii he
 These defaulters include Bhushan Steel, Bharti Shipyard, Winsome Diamonds & Jewelers and Essar Steel
 vitt varsh kii pehali chamahi main bhartiya banking pranali main kul duubat karj 6 se 7 lakh karod ru
 Price is stated
 lekin maalya ke vipareet baaki tamaam companiyaan khud ko bachaae hue hai
 His personal guarantees are believed to have been a loss deal for Mallya without whom it was difficult for him to raise funds but due to which banks can now go after him
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki bainkon ko jhaanse main bhi rakhaa gaya hoga ki kingfisher main sab kuch sahi he
 Mallya had decided that his board of directors should have big and reliable people - whether he was the former head of SEBI
 en
 Be it Bajpai, tennis player Vijay Amritraj, retired IAS officer Piyush Mankad or redefined
 com ke sansthaapak dewan arun nanda
 Some banks are already under investigation
 pravartan nideshaalay kaa kahana he ki mani londering ke maamle main keefee ko 900 karod dene vaale idibiai bank ne karj ke badale main bandhak rakhi gai jamaanat ko nahin chhudaaya
 Directorate officials have come to know that out of that an amount of 300 crore was taken to Britain and the rest 600 crore
 ko desh ke baaki hisson main
 For this Mallya, the then finance head of KFA A
 raghunathan or rin ko paas karne vaale idibiai bank ke adhikari jaanch ke ghere main hai
 Some people have raised questions on this policy of the Reserve Bank not to dismiss any debt due to lack of collateral
 kai log yah sawaal bhi uthaa rahe hai ki kaise maalya kingfisher brand ko 3,500 karod ru
 Managed to keep the mortgage for while company law does not allow this
 esbiai or keefee ke bich 10 agast, 2010 ke drushti bandhan qaraar ke tahat agar keefee karj kii adaayagi karne main naakaam rahati he to esbiai ko tamaam trademark or saakh kaa swaamitv mil janaa tha, jisamen fli kingfisher, flying modells, fli da good times, fanliner va kingfisher shaamil hai
 Consulting company Thornton also sold the Kingfisher trademark in 2009 for Rs 4,111 crore
 mulya kaa aanka tha
 But now its value is negligible
 aise main bainkon ke mul dhan kii vaapasi kii kya sambhaavnaaen hai? ab tak rehan rakhe gaye sheyaron va anya pratibhutiyon ko bechakar ve 1,200 karod ru
 Have been able to gather iske alaava karnataka hycourt main 1,250 karod ru
 And are credited
 varsh 2013 main jab kuch bainkon ne bakaae ke liye maalya se sampark kiya, jo us samay 6,493 karod ru
 Price, Mallya told him that a lot of it would be paid off after the deal with Diageo as the British company United Breweries Holdings and the rest of the USL companies had Rs 5,000 crore
 mulya ke share hasil karne vaali thi
 The deal was signed in 2013 but Rs 2,400 crore
 ke bahut kam mulya par
 Then when the bank moved the court with the plea that the deal was not in agreement with that agreement, the High Court stayed the deal
 maamla ab supreme court main he
 Many fingers are also arising towards the banking system
 bainkon ko enpie kaa elaan or pehle kar dena chahie tha, unhen 2010 main keefee ke karj kii punarsanrachana nahin kerani chahie thi, jab unhone 1,355 karod ru
 61 of the market value of kfa's share of debt
 6 fisadi premium par immunity main tabdeel kar diya tha or arabiai ko is tarah kii punarsanrachana kii ijaajat nahin deni chahie thi
 Due to money laundering investigation or any criminal case, the defaulters may be punished but the money owed to the banks cannot be refunded
 kingfisher ke maamle main bank shaayad kabhi apane bakaae kii vasuuli na kar paaen kyonki company ke paas koi sampatti bachi hi nahin he
 The other option may be to recover Mallya's personal assets, but he will also have legal hurdles
 maalya prakaran sarkaar, niamakon or banking vyavastha ke liye ankhen kholane vaala he
 But even this time, if the system is not cleaned, the guilty people are not punished and the dues are not recovered, then it will remain as a case of another fraudulent businessman who has defeated the system

 On the other hand, Sharad Pawar has given a statement that no Shiv Sena leader has contacted him
 somvaar ko congress kii antarim adhyaksh sonia gandhi se milakar sharad pavaar ne shivasena ke saath milakar sarkaar banane par tha ki agar aisi charchaa hogi to sirf uddhav thakare se hogi
 In this way, there is a lot of rhetoric from both the Shiv Sena and the NCP, but so far the talk of the two parties has not been seen at least officially on any concrete outcome

 vodaphone india ne kaha ki nikat bhavishya main 2ji va 3ji sevaaon ke shulk baraabar honge
 The company believes that there is still some scope for further reduction in 3G rates
 vodaphone india ne apni 3ji seva 2010-11 main shuru kii thi
 It has said that the fee for 3G service was ever 6-7 times more than 2G, which is now reduced to only 1
 5 guna rah gaya he
 Vodafone India business head (delhi) Subrata Padhi said that we had reduced 3G data prices about four months ago
 hamaara maananaa he ki nikat bhavishya main 3ji va 2ji kaa shulk ek sa hi ho jayega
 He said this similarity could come through an increase in 2G tariffs or a reduction in 3G tariff rates

 The Supreme Court will hear 6 important cases including Ram temple
 isamen sabase mahatvapurn he ram janmabhumi kaa maamla
 All preparations have been made in the court for the hearing
 deshbhar kii nigahen aaj se shuru ho rahi is sunwaayee par lagi rahengi
 Apart from this, five other cases like the Yogi government's vision document, Rann Basera, Bofors and Aadhaar Essentials will be heard in the Supreme Court for firing on karsevaks in Ayodhya, to secure the Taj Mahal
 ram mandir maamle ke liye hazaron pannon ke dastavejon kaa saat alag-alag bhashaaon or lipiyon main anuwaad kar liya gaya he
 Now it will be interesting to see if a party lays down a legal quarrel to postpone the hearing
 Since the last hearing in the Supreme Court on 5 December, the Uttar Pradesh government has translated all the documents into 53 sections
 ye dastauez sanskrit, farsi, arabi, pali, urdu sahit saat bhashaaon yaa lipiyon main hai
 If sources are to be believed, the Shia Waqf Board will demand from the Supreme Court that his plea be heard before the main case is heard
 apni yachika main shiya vakf board ne nichali adaalat dwaara 30 march, 1996 ko die us faisle ko chunauti di he jiske tahat zamin kaa malikana haq sunni vaqf board ko diya gaya tha
 The UP Central Shia Waqf Board is in touch with some Hindu organizations in this regard
 board chahta he kicortmen is yachika par sunwaayee ke dauraan ye sanghathan uskaa saath den
 According to Shia Waqf Board sources, if the court verdict on this petition comes in their favor, then the main case will not need to be heard, because it is ready to give up its ownership from the disputed land
 wo bhi is shart ke saath ki janmasthan par ram mandir bane or muslim bahul ilaake main masjid bane
 In fact, seven decades after losing the legal battle of ownership of the Babri Masjid, the Shia Waqf Board has approached the Supreme Court
 shiya vakf board ne babari masjid par apni daavedaari jataate hue yah bhi kaha ki mandir ko todakar babari masjid banaai gai thi
 In its petition filed in the Supreme Court, the board said that since all matters related to it are pending in the Supreme Court
 isliye unhone nichali adaalat ke faisle ko sidhe adaalat main chunauti di he
 In its petition, the board said that Babri Masjid was not built by Mughal emperor Babur but by his captain Abdul Mir Baqi
 board kaa yah bhi kahana he ki mir baaki ne apni kamai ke dhan se iskaa nirmaan karaayaa tha
 The Babri Masjid was built by demolishing the temple
 chunki mir baaki shiya musalmaan tha, lihaaja yah shiya vakf kii sampatti he
 Mutavalli, the custodian of this mosque, has also been a Shia for hundreds of years
 yachika main kaha gaya ki nichali adaalat kaa yah aadesh galat he jisamen babari masjid ko shiya vakf kii sampatti maanane se inkaar kar diya gaya tha
 Now it will be interesting to see in the debate how much importance the Supreme Court gives to the Shia Board's claim
 vaise elahabaad hoicourt kii lakhanu peeth ke faisle ko chunauti is bina par bhi di gai he ki maamla malikana haq kaa tha na ki bantwaare kaa
 So why was the decision to distribute the land and how? Aaj Tak talked to several important parties, it was found that the Uttar Pradesh government has translated 53 volumes of important documents required in this case
 wo supreme court tak pahunch chuke hai
 Anyway, instead of having to file all the documents, translation of the required parts has been provided
 saath hi court ke aadesh ke mutabik supreme court ke register ke saath is maamle se jude sabhi pakshakaron kii meeting bhi ho chuki he
 That is, the ground is ready
 bas court khel ke niyam tay kar degaa or khel shuru ho jayega
 According to the Shia Waqf Board and the lawyers of the Hindu Mahasabha, the AOR of all the parties met twice before the Registrar Judicial
 pehali 22 janvari ko duusari 1 farvari ko
 In the last hearing, the Supreme Court while giving time to everyone said that all parties came ready
 supreme court ne sabhi pakshon ke AOR ko kaha tha ki register jeudicial ke saath baithak kar jaruri kayeeji karwaai ko puraa kare
 However, it is being told from the Sunni Waqf Board that some paperwork is yet to be completed
 karsevakon par goli chalaane ke maamle kii bhi sunwaayee1990 main car sevakon par goli chalaane kaa maamla bhi supreme court pahunch gaya he
 Rana Sangram Singh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking a case against the then Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam Singh Yadav, for ordering the firing on Kar Sevaks in 1990
 rana sangram singh ne apni yachika main kaha he ki 6 farvari 2014 ko mainpuri jile main yojit ek jansabha main mulaayam singh yadav ne kaha tha ki unke aadesh par 1990 main police ne ayodhya main car sevakon par goli chalaai thi
 So now they should be prosecuted for killing kar sevaks
 tajmahal par yogi sarkaar degi vijan documentatajmahal ko surakshit rakhane ke liye yogi sarkaar supreme court main vijan document degi
 In the last hearing, the Supreme Court sought a vision document to protect the Taj Mahal for 300-400 years

 Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) President Raj Thackeray reached the fasting site on Monday to support the goodwill mission of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 modi is mishan ke tahat teen dinon se upwas par baithe the
 On this occasion, while praising Modi, Sushma said from an open platform that Narendra Bhai, you go on the Rajpath, we are with you
 vahiin duusari ore raaj thakare ne kaha ki modi ek achche pradhanmantri sabit ho sakate hai or is paristhiti main unki party modi kaa samarthan karegi
 On the last day of Modi's fast, Sushma addressed the gathering there, "narendra Bhai is fasting today but he has been ruling Gujarat in good faith for the last 10 years
 " unhone kaha, "pichley 10 varsh ke dauraan narendra bhai ne bahut sangharsh kiya he
 He has been making his way through struggles
 vah aage bhi aise hi rasta banaate aaenge, hamen ummid he
 Maintaining this confidence and maintaining the spirit of goodwill, Narendra Bhai, you continue on the Rajpath, we are with you
 " sushamaa ne kaha, "ab to hamaare ghor virdohi bhi modi kii tarif karte hai
 In a recent National Integration Council meeting, Modi was strongly praised by Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Mehbooba Mufti
 " unhone kaha, "gujarat ek aisa pradesh he jahaan kisi ke saath bhedbhaav nahin hota
 There is no project here to see that it benefits Hindus and Muslims
 yah sochakar koi sadak nahin banati ki yah musalamaanon yaa hinduon ke gharon se hokar gujaregi
 "sushma said," Narendra Bhai runs every scheme for 100 percent people
 iskaa laabh har vyakti ko miltaa he
 Every citizen in his eyes is Gujarati, he is Indian
 " modi ke sadbhaavna mishan ko samarthan dene pahunche raaj thakare ne patrakaron se baatcheet main kaha, "main apni shubhakamanaayen dene ke liye yahaan aayaa hum

 " Famous for his different role in the Hindi cinema crowd, a book by Nandita Das became famous in Hindi literature
 darasal, apane samay main sarvaadhik lokapriy or vivaadit sahityakar-patrkaar saadat hasan manto ke jivan par nandita ke nirdesan main "manto" naam se ek film bani he
 Nawazuddin Siddiquin played Manto in the film
 film ke liye nandita ne manto kii kahaniyon or unki rachanaaon ko khub padhaa
 After the film, Nandita has compiled 15 favorite stories of "manto"
 hindi or angreji main ye sankalan pathakon ke bich aane ko taiyaar he
 However, some copies have also been distributed in Mumbai
 haalanki kitaab aane se pehle hi uske cover par vivaad shuru ho rahaa he
 Actually, Nawazuddin's "picture" has got a place on the cover of the book rather than Manto or the author
 jo manto kaa poster hi he
 Hindi writers are feeling this thing exasperated
 ise bazaar ke aage ek eemaandaar lekhak kii "hatya" kaha ja rahaa he
 Naturally, the question is whether the writer "manto" is older or Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who plays his character in the film? On social media, the young Hindi litterateurs alleged that Nawazuddin's association with the book was what got him on the cover
 kuch logon ko ummid nahin thi kinanditake sampadan main is tarah kii 'harakat' hogi
 It is being described as a cheap tactic to sell a book at the expense of the achievements of a respected author
 bataate chalem ki kitaab kaa prakaashan,manto filmbanane vaala production house or raajakmal prakaashan samooh sanyukt rup se kar rahaa he
 How did the controversy unfold? The controversy over the cover started after a special screening of the film "manto" in Mumbai
 darasal, kitaab kii kuch pratiyaan 5 sitambar 2018 ko vitarit kii gai thim
 As soon as the cover was noticed, a section of litterateurs started criticizing it on social media
 is dhade main zyaadaatar yuva sahityakar, patrkaar or manto ko chaahane vaale activist hai
 On this whole matter, it has been said by Rajkamal Publishing Group that lightening or overthrowing Manto's image through the cover is not the purpose
 prakaashan samooh ne ek lambey fasebuk post main likhaa, "iskaa makasad manto ke sahitya or un par bani film ko zyada se zyada logon ke bich pahunchaana he
 Therefore, the front cover of the book is a modified version of the film's poster itself
 kitaab ke back cover par film ke production house kaa logo bhi prakaashan ke logo ke saath chapa he
 This book has been published exclusively to commemorate the making of the film Manto
 yah ek special adishan bhar he, na ki regular adishan
 "nothing has come out from Nandita or production on this whole controversy yet
 yuva kahanikar or activist sanjeev chandan ne kaha, "chuppi saadh lenaa saahitiyik jamaat kii avmaananaa he
 Some people are arguing that the cover of books or pictures of related films or plays is printed all over the world, but they are misleading
 kitabon par bani film kii tasviir laganaa ek baat he or lekhak kii jagah use abhinit karne vaale actor kii tasviir duusari baat he

 Amarinder Singh (@capt_amarinder)october 24, 2016 Rajendra Kumar, principal secretary and senior IAS officer of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, is facing increasing difficulties
 unke khilaaf sibiai ne ek nayaa maamla darj kiya he
 The CBI team on Tuesday carried out raids on Kejriwal's Principal Secretary Rajendra Kumar's office and home
 isi dauraan unke ghar par tay seemaa se zyada sharaab kii bottlen baraamad huin
 Keeping this in view, a new lawsuit was filed against him under the Enforcement Act
 unke khilaaf pehle se hi bhrashtachar ke sangeen aaropon main maamla darj he

 The case of the largest debit card fraud in history has come to light in India
 iske baad desh ke chah bainkon ne lagbhag 32 lakh debit cards block kar die hai
 It is being told that this has happened due to using atms containing malware
 ab yah sawaal uthanaa laazmi he ki atm ourdebit card main sendhakaise lagati he
 Can it be breached only through malware? aisa nahin he atm card hack karne ke kai tareeke saamne aate rahe hai
 Learn and how the hackers carry out their dangerous plans
 atm mashin main hota kya he kabhi aapane sochaa he? lagbhag sabhi atm main neeche die gaye componants hote hai
 - Operating system - ATM units management system - Special software for interacting with the user - Special software for communicating with the processing center which gives the necessary information of the transaction
 - anti virus software or control softwarein sab ke alaava ejiniers apni sahuuliyat ke liye ismenadob reader, redmin, team vydraor duusare remot software rakhte hai taaki ise thik kiya ja sake
 They act as soft targets for hackers
 vijual collectionetiem main lage gaye sisitivi camere aam camaron kii tarah nahin hote hai
 These cameras also work like computers through the Internet Protocol ie IP address
 kai baar ye inter connected hote hai or kai baar inhen ypi ke jariye desh ke kisi kone se acces kiya ja saktaa he
 The SIP or other bank atms have their IP cameras located near the access bank and the footage is recorded on the server
 ab havers ke liye ypi camera hack karnaa zyada mushkil nahin he
 Hacking the camera means that they can see which person is using the ATM and the special thing is that from here they also keep note of the pattern of PIN entered by that person
 atm ke jarieduniya bhar main kai aise maamle aae hai jinamein atiemmshin main koi hardware paaya gaya he
 These are in the form of key loggers, which hackers place in the ATM machine in such a way that no one knows about this
 isse atm kii jaankaree sahit usapar bani blike pattee kaa clon ban jaataa he or havers iskaa yuj karke paise uda sakate hai
 a security researcher from Security Week claims that creaminals can withdraw cash from atms through a USB stick
 aise kai maamle saamne aae hai jahaan aise dekhne ko mila he
 Card details are also flown through Tyupkin attack
 There have been many cases where hackers have blown money from an ATM machine without a card through specialized malware
 yah ek balldor he jise Tyupkin bhi kaha jaataa he
 This requires hackers to have an ATM machine that uses a 32-bit Windows operating system
 zyaadaatar atm main mashin main hota he Windows XP2014 tak duniya bhar ke lagbhag 95 fisadi atm mashin main abhi bhi oparating system ke taur par Windows XP hi yuj kiya jaataa he
 Microsoft has now stopped supporting this operating system
 yani isamen security ptch nahin die ja rahe hai jisaki vajah se khatre bad gaye hai
 However, the company continued with the security patch for the ATM network
 phir bhi atm exparts kaa maananaa he ki agar sabhi bank nae varjan ke windos apadet karne main fail sabit hote hai to isse kasmatmers ko khatra ho saktaa he
 If hackers discover new flaws in Windows XP, they can target the ATM machine for a long time
 aise hote he Tyupkin ke jariye ataikauthupkin atake karne ke liye booteble sidi hoti he jisamen mailaware hote hai
 Through this CD, this dangerous script is inserted into the machine
 mashin ek baar riboot hoti he or phir wo criminals ke control main aa jaati he
 The attacker then controls this and intercepts the data of the ATM card of the customers
 Tyupkin se prabhavit deshresearchrs ke mutabik eastern europe ke 50 se bi zyada atm main ye program paae gaye
 It first came from Russia and now it is also being used in other countries
 isamen bharat sahit america, china, israel or france jaise desh shaamil hai
 What happened in the country, the world, metropolitan sports, economic and Bollywood

 nagaland main bhi is baar bijepi apane sahyogi dal andipeepi ke saath milakar sarkaar banaate dikh rahi he
 bjp's ally NDPP president and CM candidate Nifio Rio said a close fight with the alliance of NPF and JDU was visible
 rio ne kaha ki sarkaar ne paise kaa istemaal kiya he
 We will still form a majority government
 unhone chunaavon main paison kii baat kaha ki bijepi ne yaha par zyada focus nahin kiya
 He was paying more attention to Tripura Meghalaya
 tippaniyan Rio said that the government has used the money
 ham abhi bhi bahumat kii sarkaar banaaenge
 He said about the money in the elections that the BJP did not focus much on it here
 ve tripura meghalaya par zyada dhyaan de rahe the
 Rio said there was a possibility of a sell-off
 lekin janata sabak sikhaa detii he
 On the issue of non-opposition assembly, he said that it is too early to say anything on this
 siem ke mudde par bhi unhone yahi kaha
 Rio said that the government has used the money
 ham abhi bhi bahumat kii sarkaar banaaenge
 He said about the money in the elections that the BJP did not focus much on it here
 ve tripura meghalaya par zyada dhyaan de rahe the
 The comments rio ne kaha ki sarkaar ne paise kaa istemaal kiya he
 We will still form a majority government
 unhone chunaavon main paison kii baat kaha ki bijepi ne yaha par zyada focus nahin kiya
 He was paying more attention to Tripura Meghalaya
 rio ne kaha ki kharidfrokht kii sambhaavna he
 But the public teaches a lesson
 gaiyr-vipaksh vidhansabha ke mudde par unhone kahaaki abhi is par kuch kahana jaldbaaji he
 He said the same on the issue of CM

 karnataka main jari siyaasi naatak khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 It is also difficult to guess when and how it will end, because on Thursday, the Kumaraswamy government was supposed to clear the floor test in the assembly, but the day-long political drama did not allow the chance of a number test and the assembly proceedings on Friday Postponed until 11 am
 bijepi ye soch kar vidhansabha main baithi thi ki aaj kumaraswami sarkaar gir jaaegi, kyonki vaaki sarkaar ke paas number nahin the, lekin vishwaas mat par voting to dur saadhe saat ghante tak kaarywahi khinchi gai or aakhir main voting ke bajaay kaarywahi ko hi sthagit kar diya gaya
 After this, the BJP mlas sat in the assembly itself
 unki maang he ki jab tak voting nahin hogi tab tak vidhansabha se nahin hatenge
 Arrangements for bed and food have been made in the assembly itself and tonight the BJP mlas will pass in the assembly itself
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki vishwaas mat to sarkaar ne pesh kar diya, lekin sirf 15 minute ke liye hi vishwaas mat par baat hui baaki dinabhar kii kaarywahi kaa samay idhar udhar kii baton main nikaal diya gaya
 All this was done because Congress and JDS do not have mlas to win the trust vote
 wo sirf vishwaas mat ko latakaana chaahate hai
 Don't want to vote on it
 rajyapal ke paas gai bijepibijepi is maamle ko lekar rajyapal ke paas bhi gai thi
 The speaker had also received a message from the Governor that a decision on the confidence vote can be taken till the end of the proceedings today, but the speaker ignored that message of the governor and instead of getting the vote on the confidence vote today, finally the proceedings of the house Postponed
 karnataka vidhansabha main abhi kii sthiti ko dekhen to aaj vidhansabha main kul milakar 205 vidhayak maujuud the, jisamen bahumat kaa aankada 103 banataa he
 The BJP has 105 mlas in it, and the congress-jds, including all its mlas, was reaching 100 only
 aaj vidhansabha kii kaarywahi se gaayab rahane vaale vidhayakon kii sankhya 20 ho gai, jinamein congress ke 14 vidhayak, jedies ke 3 vidhayak, bispi kaa 1 vidhayak or 2 nirdaleey shaamil the
 The Congress and the JDS were hoping that some of these mlas would return and their government would survive, but the rebel mlas did not return
 balki congress ke do or vidhayak gaayab ho gaye
 This was the number game, due to which the Kumaraswamy government kept cutting time from 11 am to 6:30 pm today, for about seven and a half hours
 kumaraswami ne bijepi par lagaaya ye aropavishwaas mat prastaav par charchaa ke liye congress or jedies ne bhaashan dene ke liye do-chaar nahin balki 26 naam spikar ko de die
 Presenting the vote of confidence, Kumaraswamy said that the opposition is in a hurry too Why does it want to end the discussion today? When the number of Congress Legislature Party leader Siddaramaiah came, he started explaining the rules of assembly proceedings
 siddharmaiya ne vip kaa maamla uthaa liya ki agar vishwaas mat par kaarywahi aage badhegi to vip lagu hoga or agar vip lagu hoga to baagi vidhayakon ko vidhansabha main aana padegaa, phir supreme court ke aadesh kaa kya hoga?isi par bijepi ne shor machaana shuru kar diya ki siddharmaiya apni baat ko jaanboojh kar khinch rahe hai
 This is a manipulation of the leaders of Congress and JDS, due to which they are being delayed late for the trust vote
 isi zubaani ladaai main dopaher dedh baje tak kaa samay nikal gaya
 The speaker then adjourned the proceedings till 3 pm for lunch
 bich main siddharmaiya kaa bayaan aa gaya ki vishwaas mat taal diya jaae
 It was difficult to cut time for the BJP; Whereas Congress and JDS were busy in the time pass, it was difficult for the BJP to cut the time, because they wanted to vote immediately on the vote of confidence
 chaar ghante baad bhi bhaashanbaaji ke alaava kuch nahin dikh rahaa tha
 The BJP said that it was going to meet the Governor
 is bich sadan main congress ke netaa dike sivakumar un congressi vidhayak shrikant patil kii photo dikhaane lage, jo kal congress ke camp se gaayab hokar mumbai ke aspataal main aaj subah paae gaye
 The Congress accused the BJP of taking her MLA away
 is par bijepi kaa jawaab tha ki satta jane ke dard main congress or jedies ke netaa aisi baaten kar rahe hai
 It should not be blamed for the BJP but the Chief Minister and the Home Minister who are unable to save the mlas
 isi jubaani ladaai ke bich lunch ke baad dopaher 3 baje vidhansabha kii kaarywahi phir shuru hui jo ek ghante ke andar hi phir ek baar sthagit ho gai
 Meanwhile, BJP leaders complained to the governor, which said that the governor should tell the speaker not to delay the vote of confidence, as the CM does not have a majority and he should get the trust vote today
 vishwaas mat par faisla karne vaali baat par jab rajyapal kii chitthee vidhansabha spikar ke paas pahunchi to congress ne tok diya ki rajyapal kaise spikar ko nirdesh de sakate hai
 On this, the speaker said that the Governor did not give instructions, but expressed his wish that voting can be done on the confidence vote as the proceedings are completed today
