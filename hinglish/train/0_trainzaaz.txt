 Kohliatim India captain Virat Kohli's bat is failing completely

 Even in the Kanpur Test match, Kohli could score only 27 runs in two innings

 Captain Virat Kohli has not scored a big score after his 200 against West Indies at North Sound in July
 unhone pichhali 5 pariyon main 43 ran jode hai
 Which includes 9 runs of the first innings of the Kolkata Test
 haalanki is match se pehle hi viraat ne apane fail hone par kaha tha ki unhen form main nahin hone jaisi koi samasya nahin he or ise lekar pareshaan bhi nahin hai
 India have the chance to become the number one Test team
 Team India is on the winning chariot

 The Supreme Court has called the ban on the film in 4 states unconstitutional
 saath hi rajya sarkaron ko kanoon vyavastha sanbhaalane ko kaha he
 Welcoming this decision of the Supreme Court, Bollywood has described it as the best news of the day
 Best news of the day which restores faith in our democracy : Supreme Court suspends ban imposed by 4 states on # Padmaavat, restrains other states from issuing similar orders
 - Ayushmann Khurrana (@ayushmannk) January 18, 2018SC states censor approved # Padmaavatcan't be banned by states
 Great decision
 Every story can't be told how bullies want it
 Artists, just as anyone else, have freedom to express in India
 The states should include respect decision and curb bullies

 co / qmyj68ma63 — Milap (@zmilap) January 18, 2018 Spiritual Guru Shree Sri Ravi Shankar did a special screening of the film in Bengaluru for Spiritual Guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar on behalf of the makers of the film Padmavat, a film supporting the film
 film dekhne ke baad shrishri ravi shankar ne kaha, yah adbhut he
 We are proud of this
 unhone kaha, 'yah rani padmini kaa sammaan he
 There is no such thing in the entire film, which should be objected to
 mujhe is baat par hairaani he ki kuch log is film kaa virodh kar rahen hai
 'shri Shree also said, the controversy that has so far arisen about the film is needless
 yah film rani padmini ko sachhee shradhanjali or rajputon ke sammaan kii gaurav gaatha he
 What the Supreme Court said: On Thursday, the bench of Chief Justice of India said, it is the responsibility of the states to make law and order in the states
 yah rajyon kaa sanvaidhanik daayitv he
 Article 21 of the Constitution violates the right of people to life and freedom
 bench ne rajyon ke notification ko galat bataaya
 The Supreme Court said, this notification violates the rights under Article 21
 yah rajyon kaa daayitv he ki vah kaanoon vyavastha banaae
 It is also the responsibility of the states that the people going to see the film get a safe environment
 isse pehle atarni general ne rajyon kaa paksh rakhane ke liye somvaar kaa vakt maanga
 But the court has already given its verdict
 isse pehle nirmaataaon kaa paksh rakhte hue salve ne kaha, rajyon kaa pabandi lagaana cinemetography act ke tahat sangheey dhaanche ko tabah karnaa he
 States have no such right
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki lau and order kii aad main raajnneetik napha nuksaan kaa khel ho rahaa he
 Explain that Viacom 18 had filed a petition opposing the ban of four states
 ummid he ki pratibandh lagane vaale chaar rajya somvaar ko apana paksh rakhen
 The film was banned in four states of the country
 On Tuesday, the Haryana government decided to ban the film's release
 ranvir, deepika, shahid kapur starer ye film rajput samudaay ke virodh ke baad se hi vivaadon main he
 Prior to Haryana, the governments of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh had also banned the screening of the film
 maharashtra vidhansabha kaa chunaav parinaam aane ke baad agar congress nit democratic front lagaataar teesri baar satta main waapas aayi to party haikaman ko pradesh kaa aglaa mukhyamantri kaa chayan karne main kathin paristhitiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 The will of the newly elected mlas is significant when the indication of this intention was received on Sunday when a senior party leader and former Chief Minister of the state on condition of anonymity said that the will of the newly elected mlas is respected while taking any decision on the issue should be done
 purv mukhyamantri ne kaha ‘‘yah sab baat chunaav parinaam ke baad utpann sthitiyon par nirbhar karata he lekin navnirvaachit vidhayakon kii ichha ko tavajjo di jaani chahie
 "many candidates for the post of Chief Minister are coming out in the names of many candidates for the post of Chief Minister from the Congress Party in Maharashtra
" duusari ore sahyogi rakanpa kaa kahana he ki is vishay par congress haikaman ko nirnay karnaa he or is pad ke liye jiskaa chayan hoga party uskaa samarthan karegi
 In this case, the real picture will emerge only when the election results are revealed in the afternoon of 22 October
 adhikansh surveykshanon main maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main congress-rakanpa gathbandhan ke satta main dobaaraa waapas lautne kii bhavishyavaanee kii gai he, haalanki vipakshi bhaajapa-shivasena gathbandhan isse sahamat nahin he
 Ashok Chavanbaharhal, who does not want to give up the chair, the current Chief Minister Ashok Chavan, who has been in power for the last 10 months, has clarified that he is aspiring to lead the next government after the election results
 chavaan 13 oktober ko chunaav sampann hone ke baad dilli aae or unhone party ke kendriya netaaon se baatcheet kii
 While his predecessor and Union Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh is saying that he is happy at the Center, a similar thing is coming out from another Union Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde
 varisht netaa hone ke maddenjar deshmukh or scindia ko chunaav main mahatvapurn jimmedaari saunpi gai thi
 While Deshmukh led the Election Management Committee of the party, Shinde headed the Election Campaign Committee
 lekin saarvajanik rup se is tarah kii koi baat nahin kehane ke baavjood party halkon main inke mukhyamantri pad ke daud main hone kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 In this regard, Union Minister Prithviraj Chavan can prove to be a hidden person
 jabaki shivasena se congress main shaamil hue pradesh ke mantri narayan rane ne bhi is pramukh pad ke liye apni ichha nahin chodi he
 Virat has been counted among the most successful captains of India
 
 
 lekin newjiland ne vishwa cap jeetne kaa unka sapana todaviraat kohli na sirf ran mashin ke naam se jane jate hai, balki unhen ab bharat ke sabase safal captainon main bhi gina jane laga he
 In the current round it seems that they are impossible to defeat, but they have also failed and this is exemplified by the World Cup semi-final match played in England this year
 semifinal main bharat ko newjiland ne maat de vishwa cap jeetne ke sapane ko tod diya tha
 Kohli has said that he too is hurt by failures like a common man
 kohli ne india today kaha, 'kya main asafalataaon se prabhavit hota hum? haa, hota hum
 Everyone is
 ant main main ek baat jaanata hum ki meri team ko meri jarurat he
 In the semi-finals, i felt that i would return unbeaten and bring my team out of this difficult phase
 'kohli ne kaha, 'lekin ho saktaa he ki wo meraa ahm ho kyonki aap kaise bhavishyavaanee kar sakate ho? aapke andar sirf majboot ahsaas ho sakate hai yaa phir is tarah kaa kuch karne kii prabal ichhashakti

 'after beating Bangladesh in a day-night Test match in Kolkata, Kohli's team has been compared to the 1970-1980 team of the Windies, but the captain says that there is still time for such comparisons
 captain ne kaha, 'main sirf itnaa kah saktaa hum ki ham apane khel ke sheersh par hai
 You cannot express the team's dominance from seven matches
 aap westeindies kii us team kii baat kar rahe hai, jisane 15 saal tak raaj kiya he,'i hate losing, says@imvkohli

 Not after seven matches

 Kohli said that there has been a change in the mentality of the team and the team is now confident that they can win overseas as well
 unhone kaha, 'tulana karne main abhi bhi samay he, lekin ham jis tarah se khel rahe hai or jo chunautiyaan hamaare saamne hai unhen lekar ham kaaphi utsahit hai

 bijepi or aap kar rahe siddhu ko apane paale main laane ke prayassiddhu ko or sidline nahin karnaa chahta congress alaakamananwajot singh siddhu kii punjab cabinet main vaapasi ke kayaas garm he
 It is discussed that soon Navjot Singh Sidhu will once again make a strong comeback in the Punjab cabinet and this time he will also be ranked higher
 siddhu ko dipti siem banaaya ja saktaa he
 If sources are to be believed, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi herself wants Sidhu to be made the Chief Minister of Punjab and in this regard she has also spoken to Captain Amarinder Singh
 mana ja rahaa he ki party se naaraaz chal rahe punjab congress ke vidhayakon ko santusht karne or aam aadmi party or bijepi kii taraf se navjot singh siddhu ko apane paale main laane ko lekar die ja rahe bayanon kii vajah se congress alaakaman navjot singh siddhu ko ab or sidline nahin karnaa chahta
 It is also believed that many mlas are running angry from Captain Government and Sidhu is leading the angry mlas
 isi vajah se navjot singh siddhu kii cabinet main vaapasi karwaane kii taiyaari he or unhen dipti siem kaa pad bhi diya ja saktaa he
 All the leaders of Punjab Congress and State President Sunil Jakhar are giving a statement on this matter
 navjot singh siddhuki cabinet main bataur dipti siem joardaar vaapasi kii khabaron par sunil jakhad ne inkaar bhi nahin kiya, lekin gend alaakaman ke paale main daalate hue kaha ki jo alaakaman tay karegaa, vah sab ko maanya hoga
 On the other hand, Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh's Political Advisor and MLA Amarinder Singh created a new controversy in Raja Wadding, saying that ministers who are not doing their job properly, whose performance is not right, should get them out of the cabinet
 The path must be shown
 aap vidhayak ne saadhaa captain sarkaar par nishanadusri tarfaam aadmi partike vidhayak kultar singh sandhwa ne captain sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki captain kaamkaaj thik se karne main vifal rahe hai
 Along with Sidhu, many leaders of his party are angry
 unhone kaha ki navjot singh siddhu ko kursi ke laalach main nahin padana chahie
 He should see that the things that led to his leaving the minister, he should keep on those things and keep talking about the interest of the people of Punjab
 bijepi ne bataaya congress kaa aantarik maamlawipakshi bijepi ne is puure maamle se pallaa jhaadte hue kaha ki yahcongreska andruni maamla he or unhen hi tay karnaa he ki siddhu ko kya jimmedaari deni he
 State spokesperson of the party Vineet Joshi said on the question whether Sidhu will go to BJP or any other party, only Sidhu can answer this
 istife ke baad bhi cabinet mantri kaa vetan- bhattanvjot singh siddhu ne 20 july ko cabinet mantri ke pad se istipha de diya tha
 After this he did not go to the Punjab Secretariat or the Legislative Assembly
 baavjood iske siddhu ke vetan- bhatte cabinet mantri ke hisaab se hi taiyaar ho rahe hai
 Sidhu is still a cabinet minister in the assembly's record
 iske peeche vajah yah bataai ja rahi he ki punjab sarkaar ne unke istife ko lekar koi notification jari nahin kiya he
 The BJP has announced the names of 15 candidates from Gujarat for the Lok Sabha elections
 iske baad gujarat bijepi main hangaamaa shuru ho gaya he
 However, the BJP first announced candidates on the seats that were least likely to cause uproar
 lekin surendranagar seat se tikat katane ke baad yahaan ke saansad devji fatehpura ne hangaamaa khadaa kar diya or bijepi se istipha dene kii dhamkee di he
 Mahendra Munjapara has been given ticket from Surendranagar
 devji fatehpura ne apni naaraazgi media ke saamne jataate hue kaha ki, bijepi main gutbaji chal rahi he
 The idea that BJP tried to find out was just a play
 dilachasp yah he ki devji fatepura do baar congress se vidhayak rah chuke hai
 When Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, when he was named the candidate for the post of PM, after this Devji Fatehpur joined BJP and was elected MP in 2014
 saathiyon se bole- vakt aane par aapke bhi bure din aaengetikat katane ke baad devji fatehpura kaa gussa yaheen nahin thama, unhone congress chhodkar aae netaaon ko naseehat bhi de daali
 Recently, after leaving the Congress and came to the BJP and with cabinet minister Kunwarji Bavaliya, he said that Bavaliya will also know when the time comes
 unhone kaha ki baawaliya ke bhi bijepi main bure din aaenge
 He alleged that Jayanthi Kavadia, the BJP leader, has cut my ticket
 tikat na milane se naaraaz devji fatehpura ne aane vaale dinon main apane samaaj ke logon ko ikattha kiya he
 Devji Fatehpura said that the people of the society will decide whether to revolt by staying in BJP or should go to Congress
 do din ke andar wo samaaj ke logon ke saath milakar apana faisla le lenge
 If the society asks, then he will resign from BJP also
 devji fatehpura ne ye bhi aarope lagaaya he ki, jis mahendra munjapara ko tikat diya gaya he, usne surendra nagar ke vikaas main koi ahm bhoomika adaa nahin kii he

 Why Anvita is named in the discussion: she has designed an app to teach children on iphones and ipads
 iske jariye bachche 100 jaanwaron ke naam or unki boliyaan sikh sakate hai
 How to make an app: According to an English newspaper, Avanita had a desire to make a mobile app at the age of seven
 wo is kaam kisi develper se siikhnaa chaahati thi lekin uske pigi bank (bachat khate) main itane paise nahin the ki wo kisi develper ko hair kare
 But the desire to learn opened up all the ways and he learned programming to develop online apps
 ap develping ke bare main puche jane par wo kahati he ki ye kaam bahut mushkil tha lekin kaam ke prati jab ruchi ho to koi bhi kaam aasaan ho jaataa he

 Now the Bishnoi society will file an appeal in the High Court against Salman's bail
 bishnoi samaaj kaa kahana he ki salmaan ko jamaanat milane se wo behad aahat hue hai or ab satr nyaayalay ke aadesh ke khilaaf ucch nyaayalay main apil karenge
 Apart from this, the Bishnoi society has also decided to appeal against the Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, Neelam and Sonali Bendre released from the lower court in this case
 maaloom ho ki bishnoi samaaj ke log junglee jaanavar or pedo ke liye apni jaan kaa najarana pesh karne ko bhi taiyaar rahete hai
 This is the reason that when the case of hunting of black deer came in the hands of Salman Khan, he came on the streets
 vahiin, shanivaar kosalmanaki bel bond bhar di gai he
 Today he will also be released from jail
 shanivaar ko thik teen baje satr nyaayalay ke nyaayadhish rabindra kumaar joshi ne apana faisla sunaaya

 haalanki court ne ye bhi kaha ki salmaan khan bina court kii parmishan ke desh se baahar nahin ja sakate
 Meanwhile, public prosecutor Bhavani Singh Bhati opposed Salman's bail and said that the film actor should not be granted bail
 unka kahana tha ki yah sajaa ke nilamban kaa maamla he
 There is no regular bail case
 unka kahana tha ki transfar ke baavjood jaj kaa faisla sunaanaa thik nahin, lekin jaj joshi ne salmaan ke vakil kii daleelon ko sweekaar karte hue film abhinayta ko jamaanat de di

 Rahul Gandhi said in his tweet that only in 2016, 19,675 cases of rape of minor girls were reported
 unhone kaha tha ki pradhanmantri ko in maamalon main teji se sunwaayee karke peediton ko nyaay dilaane kaa upaay karnaa chahie
 Two days ago, Maneka Gandhi wrote to the Chief Ministers of all the states, asking them to set up a special cell to deal with sexual harassment
 mukhyamantriyon or centre shasit pradesh ke uparajyapal ko likhe gaye patr main menka gandhi ne kaha tha ki aise maamalon kii jaanch or saboot ikattha karne ke liye police ke logon kii vishesh training honi chahie or rajyon main forensik lab kii sthapana honi chahie, jisase doshi batch na sake or unhen teji se sajaa dilaai ja sake
 At the same time, in the conversation with Aaj Tak, President of National Commission for Women Rekha Sharma said, "I have been demanding amendment in the Poxo Act for a long time
 ham iskaa swaagat karte hai
 He said that special fast track courts should also be set up to punish the girls for rape

 In Bihar, a series of human chains are being organized across the state on the initiative of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar against child marriage and dowry system
 is kaarykram ke dauraan 13600 kilometre lambii maanav shrinkhalaa banane kaa kaarykram he jisamen takreeban 4
 5 crore people are expected to participate
 vipakshi dal argedy is maanav shrinkhalaa ko lekar lagaataar sarkaar par hamalaa bol rahaa he or aarope laga rahaa he ki sarkaar maanviya pahalu ko darkinar kar jabaran logon ko maanav shrinkhalaa main shaamil hone ke liye baadhya kar rahi he
 In this sequence, former Deputy Chief Minister and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has attacked the government through tweet
 tejasvi yaadan ne aarope lagaaya ki ek taraf jahaan patna main bheeshan thand kii vajah se jila prashasan sabhi skulon ko band karne kaa aadesh de rahaa he vahiin duusari taraf nitish kumaar schuli bacchon ko maanav shrinkhalaa main bhaag lene ke liye taanaashaahee farmaan suna rahe hai
 Tejaswi said that there is bizarre administrative irony in Bihar where schools are being holidayed due to cold on the one hand and on the other hand it is being made compulsory for children to participate in human chain
 unhone kaha ki yah nitish kumaar kaa taanaashaahee ravaiya he jisaki vajah se bacchon ko bhi maanav shrinkhalaa main anivaary rup se hissaa lene ke liye kaha ja rahaa he
 Taking a dig at Nitish, Tejashwi further said that the Chief Minister is currently running a stolen government in Bihar and is resorting to a human chain to hide his monstrous acts

 sanjay singh ne kaha ki nitish kumaar ke netritv ko bihar kii janata ne chunaa tha
 Sanjay Singh said that what can be more ironic than this that the Leader of Opposition, Tejashwi Yadav is questioning the participation of children in human chain during the cold, but to know the condition of the poor people in the cold even for 1 day from his official bungalow Did not get out ham krishi mantralay ke tahat krishi laagat va mulya ayog kii website par gaye

 Smriti filed the form on Thursday
 unhone jo halafanama diya he, use lekar ek baar phir vivaad ho gaya he
 Actually, Smriti Irani has again given different information about her degree row
 is baar unhone kaha he ki 3 saal kaa degree course puraa nahin kiya he
 Whereas in 2014 elections he did not give such clear information
 vahiin 2004 main unhone ek halafanaame main khud ko graduate kaha tha
 While the Congress took a dig at the new affidavit, Smriti Irani also retaliated
 kendriya mantri ne javaabi hamalaa karte huye kaha ki vah amethi ke liye or congress ke khilaaf mehnat se kaam karti rahengi chaahe unako jitna apamaanit or pratadit kiya jaataa rahe
 The Congress mocked Smriti Irani, saying - because the minister was also a graduate

 There is no such abuse, there is no such insult, there is no such harassment as a woman which Congress leaders have not done to me
 meraa unako ekmaatr yahi sandesh he ki aap mujhe jitna apamaanit karoge, jitna mujhe pratadit karoge utana hi jamkar main amethi main congress ke khilaaf kaam karuungi
 "earlier in Delhi, the Congress accused Union Minister Smriti Irani of lying in her election affidavit saying that she should resign from the post of minister on moral grounds and the Election Commission should disqualify her
 congress pravaktaa priyanka chaturvedi ne mashhoor serial ‘kyonki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi' ke geet kii tarj par kaha, ‘‘kwalification ke rup badalte hai, nae-nae saanche main dhalate hai
 One degree comes, one degree goes, the affidavits formed are new
 
 
 kyonki mantri bhi kabhi graduate thim
 "he issued a copy of affidavits of the last few elections of the Union Minister," Smriti Irani told how it is possible to pass 12th from graduate, it is possible only in Modi government

 Then in the 2011 Rajya Sabha Election Affidavit, she tells bcom First Year

 Now she has become bcom First Year degree again
 ''priyanka ne aarope lagaaya, ‘‘unhone desh ko jhooth bolaa he, desh ko bargalaaya he
 This proves how BJP leaders lie
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘hamen dikkat nahin he ki vah graduate nahin hai

 '' congress pravaktaa ne kaha, ‘‘agar unamem koi naitikta he to mantri pad se istipha den or unhen chunaav ke liye ayogy tehraaya jaae

 ) The memories of that competitive T20 match played 21 years ago in Peshawar under Abdul Qadir's mind are still alive when 16-year-old Sachin Tendulkar, who hit three sixes in his over, created a panic in the Pakistani camp and only then this experienced spinner got the hang of it
 It was taken that cricket has got the 'kohinoor' diamond
 choubees april ko apana 36waan janmdin manaane ja rahe tendulkar ne bhale hi cricket ke darjanon kirtiman apane naam kar liye hon lekin 1989 main pakistan daure par test cricket main padaarpan karne vaale balak sachin ko dekhakar kaadir samet sabhi cricketer dang rah gaye the
 Qadir said in an interview given from Karachi, 'we all wondered how this schoolboy came to play cricket
 sachin bahut chota dikhataa tha
 But his ability was revealed in the exhibition T20 match played in Peshawar
 ’unhone bataaya, ‘us samay kris shrikant or sachin krij par the
 i bowled one over to Srikanth and told Sachin standing at the other end that in the next over, he should give me a six
 sachin ne pehali, duusari or paanchavin gend par chakka jadaa
 There were 28 runs in that over and then i knew that it would become the world's biggest batsman in the coming time
 ’ pakistan cricket ke purv mukhya chayankarta ne kaha, ‘maine sachin ko baccha samajhakar lallipop gend nahin daali thi balki apane puure anubhav kaa nichod usamen daal diya tha
 It was amazing for Sachin that he beat these balls and also hit four sixes in Mushtaq Ahmed's next over
 ’kaadir ne kaha, ‘maine har chakke par tali bajaai or over khatm hone ke baad use badhai bhi di
 Later on that tour, i always welcomed him with a hug
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘us daure ke baad lambey samay tak sachin apane intervyuu main kahata rahaa ki us over main pradarshan unki jindagi kaa sabase bada saramaaya he
 Later he made so many records and his cricket journey became so golden that these memories became small but i can never forget that over in my life
 ’ sachin ne us match main 18 gend main 53 ran banaaye
 Srikanth, who was the captain of India at the time, called it the best innings
 test shrinkhalaa main usne 35
 Added 215 runs at an average of 83
 kaadir ne bataaya, ‘karachi test main vakaar ne use pehali hi gend kaaphi tej outswing daali
 Playing the first match, Sachin bravely played his leg forward
 pehle hi match main uskaa yah saahas sabit karata tha ki vah koi aam cricketer nahin he
 Allah has given him some special skills
 ’ karachi main pehle test main sachin or vakaar unuus donon ne test cricket main padaarpan kiya tha
 Sachin did not leave the field despite a nose bouncer in the Sialkot match on the same tour
 pakistan ke liye 18 baras khel chuke kaadir ne kaha, ‘maine apane karier main do cricketer aise dekhe hai jinka loha duniya ne baad main mana lekin main pehle hi match main bhaanp gaya ki ye kuch khaas he
 The first is Sachin Tendulkar and the second Brian Lara
 ’unhone donon kii tulana se inkaar karte hue kaha, ‘mahaan cricketron kii koi tulana nahin ho sakati
 Both have their own style and both have no match
 cricket main naa doosraa lara paidaa hoga or naa hi sachin
 Congratulating Sachin on his birthday, he said that he will pray that he will entertain cricket lovers around the world for many years to come
 kaadir ne kaha, ‘jab sachin kheltaa he to sabhi uski ballebaaji kaa majaa lete hai
 Whether Indian or Pakistani or any other cricket lover
 main dua karata hum ki vah aane vaale kai saal tak kheltaa rahe or cricket ko alavida kehane ke baad bhi logon ke dilon par yun hi raaj kare

 Papa always used to say that i have to get clothes or hair cut like Dharam ji

 What have you learned from my father? Papa has said to give your best, work hard, take care of your workout
 apane khan paan kaa vishesh dhyaan dijie
 Which songs of Papa do you like? Husna hai suhana, shot with eyes, go to a disco, Sanna no, gold is so much gold
 
 
 
 There are many songs

 It was completely rumored and i am not like to go to the people and say launch me
 koun se actor ke saath aap kaam karnaa chahengi?akshay kumaar ke saath, main jarur kaam karnaa chaahuungi
 Will there ever be a film in which you, your father (govinda) and your brother are all three? Not yet, but maybe something like this will happen in the coming days
 kabhi aapako papa kii daant padi he?abhi bhi daant padati he, agar main raat main let ho jaaun to mujhe daant padati he
 Father has never beaten me
 mummy hameshaa se strict rahi hai

 Home Minister Rajnath Singh has said on the separatists who have taken a stance that Hurriyat leaders have no faith in humanity, Kashmiriyat and Jamuriyat
 insaaniyat, kashmiriat or jamhuriyat kii baat sabase pehle tatkaaleen piem atal bihari vaajapeyi ne 2003 main kii thi
 However, the situation in the valley was not so bad at that time, as of now
 vaajapei ne kaha tha ki kashmir kaa bhavishya yahaan kii mul prakruti yani kashmiriat, maanavtaa yani insaaniyat or loktantr yani jamhuriyat main he
 The situation in the Kashmir Valley has not been normal since the killing of Hizbul terrorist Burhan Wani
 beete april main piem modi ne bhi kashmir main shanti ke liye bataae vaajapeyi ke teen siddhanton ko doharaaya tha, or ab jab ghati main halaat saamaanya karne kii pahal ke tahat rajnath singh sarvadaleey pratinidhimandal ke saath kashmir gaye or unhen hurriyat netaaon kii ore se jis tarah kaa jawaab mila usase saaf ho gaya he ki algaavvaadi na to kashmir kaa bhala chaahate hai, na hi mulk kaa
 The separatist leaders refused to meet with the all-party delegation
 ham bataate hai kirajanath sinhane algaavvaadiyon ke bare main sahi kaha he ki hurriyat ko loktantr par yakeen nahin, inamen jamhuriyat nahin
 Their attitude is not Kashmiriyat and not humanism among these separatists
 1
 Naeem Geelani, son of separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani, has been accused of funding terrorism in the Valley
 enie videshon se ghati ke tamaam bank khaaton main aatankwaadiyon ke liye paise jamaa hone kii jaanch kar rahi he
 There is evidence that Hafiz Saeed's organization jamaat-ud-dawa and Lashkar have also sent money from Pakistan to incite violence in Jammu and Kashmir
 2
 In the first week of July, Hizbul's 'poster Boy' Burhan Wani was killed, while Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani called for a shutdown in the valley
 yah band dedh maheene se bhi zyada dinon tak chalaa
 Hurriyat leaders, instead of taking steps to restore peace in the valley, worked to provoke the local people, which affected the general life completely
 3
 Geelani and his Hurriyatpur seduce local unemployed youth and join them in protests
 ye pradarshnkaree yuvak surakshabalon par patharbaji karte hai
 These stones are bought with money
 inamen se hi kai yuvakon ne khulaasa kiya he ki ek din ke liye inhen 400 rupee tak milte hai
 Police have found out in the investigation that supporters of Hurriyat leader Gilani collect these funds from local traders
 pakistan ke aantki sanghathan bhi patharbaajon ko funding main madad karte hai

 srinagar main shuukravaar ko jume kii namaaj ke baad aksar pakistan ke jhande laharaae jate hai or bharat virdohi tathaa pakistan samarthak naare lagaae jate hai
 In recent times, flags of terrorist organization ISIS were also waved and slogans were raised in support of it
 algaavvaadiyon kii hone vaali reliyon main bhi aisi ghatnaayen saamne aati hai
 All these incidents not only have the support of the separatists, but they can also be seen involved in such meetings
 5
 Geelani and Hurriyat appealed to the people to boycott the 2014 Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections
 inkaa tark tha ki bharat sarkaar bandook ke dam par rajya main chunaav karvaa rahi he
 However, his appeal did not have any impact on the local public and the assembly elections saw a record over 65 percent voting, which was the highest in the last 25 years
 adnga kyon daal rahi he hurriyat?aakhir hurriyat ke netakashmiramen aman kii raah kaa roda kyon ban rahe hai
 The answer is the politics of the separatists, on the basis of which they seek their existence in Kashmir
 - in netaaon kii puri siyasat algaavvaad par tiki he
 - By talking, the message will be that the government is ahead in the efforts of peace
 - ye algaavvaadi netaa pakistan ko naaraaz karne kaa khatra bhi nahin uthaanaa chaahate
 Along with Pakistan, separatists also cannot afford to offend terrorists
 - aise main inhen lagata he ki agar wo sarkaar kii koshishon ke saath gaye to unka astitav hi mit jayega
 Pakistan's Yaranahurriyat leaders have refused to meet the representatives of all the parties that reached Srinagar from Delhi
 ye vahi hurriyat ke netaa hai jo dilli main pakistan ke kisi numaayinde ke aane yaa pakistani ucchayog ke har kaarykram main shariq hone daude chale aate hai
 The Pakistan High Commission celebrates Pakistan Day every year
 is maukey par kashmir ke algaavvaadi netaaon ko bhi nyotaa detaa he
 These separatists rarely ignore the invitation of the Pakistani High Commission

 Kejriwal made several announcements after the maharashtra-haryana election announcement, with the announcement of the Jharkhand elections, Kejriwal breathed a sigh of relief when the Election Commission announced the elections of Haryana and Maharashtra
 vahiin chunaav ayog ne shuukravaar ko jharkhand vidhansabha chunaav kii tarikhon kaa elaan kar diya
 Arvind Kejriwal began to feel that the announcement of Delhi elections could also be done with Jharkhand elections, but it was clear that the announcement of Delhi elections would be held on time

 unke is bayaan ke baad bijepi kocongresspar hamalaa karne kaa mauka mil gaya
 But in retaliating this, the Congress has questioned that the NPA of around Rs 3 lakh crore during the UPA rule finally reached Rs 12 lakh crore during the NDA

 Will the Modi government take responsibility for the Rs 17 lakh crore NPA? ”lonerghuram Rajan, who was given to the defaulters, said in a way, targeting the UPA government,“ Bad loans in large amounts during 2006-2008 Increased when economic growth was taking place very strongly

 Election strategist Prashant Kishor met on a cold night in Delhi last December with an Assam BJP leader
 mahaj maheenaa bhar pehle prashanth kishor bihar vidhansabha chunaav main lalu prasad yadav or nitish kumaar kii jodi ko bijepi par baari jeet dilaane main bhoomika nibhaa chuke the
 He was now preparing to help the Congress high command and Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi in the next four months in the Assam elections
 phir sawaal uthta he ki unhone hemanth biswa sarama se mulaakaat kyon kii, jo gogoi ke sahyogi rah chuke the lekin july 2015 main bijepi main chale gaye? darasal, kishor kii patni assam kii rahane vaali hai or peshey se chikitsak hai
 She has been Sarma's classmate
 kishor ke paas sarama ke liye ek peshkash thiah “congress main waapas aa jaao to aapako mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar bana diya jayega
 "sarma turned down Kishore's offer
 ab tak kaaran saaf nahin he ki kishor ne assam kaa kaam kyon chhod diya, lekin ab tak rajyabar main hui 200 se zyada jansabhaon or reliyon main sarama ne yah sabit kar dikhaaya ki is chunaav main congress ke liye ve sabase badi chunauti hai
 bjp's chief ministerial candidate Sarbananda Sonowal has held 20 sabhas outside his constituency Majuli, Gogoi has done 50 sabhas but Sarma did not hold a single meeting in his constituency Jalukbadi till 8 April
 yahi vajah he ki 4 april ko matdaan ke pehle charan main 80 fisad se zyada matdaan ke baad party adhyaksh amit shah ne pehla phone sarama ko lagaaya or unhen unki mehnat ke liye shubhakamanaayen deen
 Traditionally high turnout rates are indicative of change
 do din baad jab amit shah assam main chaar reliyaan karne pahunche to rajya ke saare netaa unke saath the lekin sarama maujuud nahin the
 During this period, Sarma completed five preparations for the second phase on 11 April by holding five more public meetings in lower Assam
 jis din shah ne unhen phone kiya tha, usee din sonia gandhi ne bhi congress ke ek sheersh netaa ko phone kiya tha
 Sonia wanted to know from him what his opinion was on the direct attack on Sarma of the Congress President in public meetings held in two important areas of lower Assam called Barpeta and Jagirod
 yah maanate hue ki sarama ne congress adhyaksh ke khilaaf apni jabaan nahin kholi thi or sirf unke bete par nishaanaa saadhaa tha, sonia ke is kadam ko galat mana gaya
 Making his way on the crowded main road to Pathshala, 100 km from Guwahati, Sarma told India Today, "the BJP-AGP-BPF alliance will win more than 45 seats in the first phase
 ” bheed unhen dekhne or chune ke liye pareshaan he
 There is a history behind such popularity of this 48-year-old leader: Sarma, who was the Minister of Education, adopted a transparent appointment system, with the help of which 60,000 graduates got the job of teachers through written examination
 bijepi ko ummid he ki iskaa istemaal alpsankhyak voton ko khinchne main kiya ja saktaa he
 Shyamakanu Mahanta, an education activist from Guwahati, says, “about one lakh teachers working in non-state schools are from minority communities
 unka maananaa he ki sarama hi unke rojgaar ko niyamit kar sakate hai
 "shah's strategy: If Sarma is handling the BJP front, then party president Shah is already preparing the roadmap for the election strategy months ago
" aresas se jabardast virodh ke baavjood unhone or narendra modi ne sarama ko bijepi main shaamil karke unhen chunaav prachaar kii kaman saunpane kaa faisla liya tha
 It is credited to Sarma that he formed the bjp's alliance with AGP and BPF
 agypi ko saath laana aasaan nahin tha kyonki uske do aalaa netaa adhyaksh atul bora or purv mukhyamantri prafull kumaar mahant bijepi ke saath koi bhi rishta banane ko taiyaar nahin the
 The strategy was to employ second-line leaders in the AGP
 yah kaam bijepi ke mahasachiv ram madhav ke jimme choda gaya
 He made several rounds of the house of three AGP mlas
 bipief ke netaa sarama ke najdiki the to unhen saath laana aasaan kaam tha
 Advantage of AIUDF The biggest help to the bjp's election campaign is coming from AIUDF founder Badruddin Ajmal, who is seen as the biggest patron of alleged Muslim migrants from Bangladesh
 ise baar-baar prachaarit kiya jaataa he ki assam main duusari sabase badi muslim aabaadi he jo 35 fisadi he
 This thing creates fear in people
 itr kaarobaari, 66 varshiya ajmal ne aksar mukhyamantri banane yaa kingmekar kii bhoomika nibhaane kii ichha jataai he
 In his speech in Assamese language at a gathering in Kosua Tiniali under Raha constituency, he says, “no party in Assam can form a government without the help of AIUDF
 ”bijepi ko yah baat pareshaan nahin karti
 The party has made a new call in this battle: This is the last battle of Saraighat in which Ajmal-led outsiders are to be thrown out
 saraighat kii nausainik jang 1671 main guwahati ke paas ladi gai thi jisamen ahomi sena ne aurangzeb kii fouj ko haraa diya tha
 Sarma names this war as a battle to save mother, daughter and caste
 ve paathshaala main kehete hai, “ham bangladeshi ajmal ko rajya par raaj nahin karne de sakate
 "according to the population of Muslims in the constituency, Sarma decides whether to sharpen or lighten the attack on Ajmal
 bijepi ke andruni sroton kii maane to “ham banaam ve” kii yah prachaar ranneeti baad main sochi gai
 The initial plan was to take advantage of the anti-incumbency and target the Gogoi government
 bade baandhon ke samvedansheel masale ko jaan-boojhkar nahin chuaa ja rahaa he jabaki gujarat model kaa prachaar karne ke naam par bipiel pariwaron ke liye 2 ru
 Kg rice, Rs 5 lakh for women self-help groups
 or yahaan-vahaan jila or ejineering collejon kii ghoshnaa kaa sahaara liya ja rahaa he
 On the other hand, Gogoi is being promoted as a patron of destruction and unscrupulous intruders and for this there is a fear among the people that Congress may form government with Ajmal
 ajmal kehete hai ki ve beshak congress kii sarkaar main shaamil ho sakate hai basharte gogoi or unke teen sahyogiyon ko pehle nikaal diya jaae
 In the Rajya Sabha elections held on March 21, he had given very solid support to the Congress candidates even when there was no need for it
 iske chalate gogoi ne kaaphi aalochana kii thi
 He told India Today, "the collusion of AIUDF and BJP
 hamane samarthan nahin maanga tha lekin unhone jaan-boojhkar samarthan diya taaki bijepi ko apane dushprachaar main laabh mil sake
 BJP has made some mistakes in ticket distribution
 rangiya, bilsipada purv, dhekiajuli, margeryta or shivsagar main “jeetne laayak” sthaneey ummidavaaron kii jagah bahriyon ko tikat de die gaye hai
 Sarma was also with Sonowal and Ram Madhav to choose the candidate
 sarama is faisle kaa bachaav karte hai, “yah prakriya bahut jatil thi
 For example, Ashok Singi was given a ticket in the former Muslim-dominated Bilasipara because he dominates over 10,000 Muslim laborers as a contractor
 ” Today, Congress advertisements were published in the big newspapers of the country, through which Rahul Gandhi is giving this message to the country
 
 
 'main nahin, ham'
 When the advertisement came out, everyone had the same thing in mind that Rahul has targeted bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi in gestures while opening the election summer
 par chaukaaney vaali baat yah he ki ab congress va rahul gandhi par modi kaa hi naaraa churaane kaa aarope lag rahaa he
 In fact, the BJP claims that in February 2011 Modi had given the slogan 'I am not us'
 modi kaa yah campan gujarat sarkaar ke kaamon se judaa hua tha
 The BJP has said on Rahul's advertisement that the Congress specializes in stealing
 ve modi ko maat dene ke chakkar main kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai
 Of Rahul
 
 
 'main nahin, ham'akhabaaron main chape rahul ke vigyaapan se saaf he ki loksabhaa chunaav main congress ke liye rahul kaa cheharaa sabase ahm he
 Sonia and Manmohan Singh do not appear in this poster
 is vigyaapan ko modi par tanj ke taur par bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 Because Modi often uses words like 'I, mine and me'
 narendra modi kaa
 
 
 'not me, we' is also true, in February 2011, Modi gave the slogan 'I am not, we'
 yah naaraa gujarat sarkaar ke campan se judaa tha
 In the first week of February 2011, a contemplation camp was organized at Mehsana Water Park in which Modi made the issue of 'I am not us' an important topic of discussion
 is dauraan stage par ek bada poster bhi laga tha jisapar yah naaraa likhaa tha
 Apart from this, many charts and posters were also put up for teamwork
 jaise hi bijepi ne congress par modi kaa idia churaane kaa aarope lagaaya is vivaad ko lekar jubaani jang tej ho gai
 While the Congress was seen on the backfoot, the BJP adopted aggressive swimmers
 naaron par kisi kaa ekadhikaar nahin: shobhaa ojhaanarendra modi kaa idia churaane ke aarope par congress netaa shobhaa ojha ne kaha, 'hamane hameshaa se sabko saath lekar chalane vaali baat kahi he
 If someone says something, it does not become a monopoly on him
 aam aadmi kaa haath congress ke saath
 
 
 Our slogan is, did we ever say that the AAP mimicked us? 'we are important' for the Congress and 'I' for the BJP: Manish Tiwari On the advertisement controversy, Manish Tiwari said, 'through Bharat Nirman in the last 10 years We took care of the common man
 upie kaa yahi mantra rahaa he ki vikaas ho par dhyaan 'ham' par hona chahie
 Whereas the opposition only focuses on the 'I'
 'saare mantriyon ko hataakar naare banane ke kaam main lagaae congress bijepirahul ke is vagyaapan par bijepi netaa shahanvaj hossain ne chutki lee
 He said, 'it is clear from the advertisement that they are talking about me, not just me
 poster main na sonia hai, na piem or na hi koi mantri
 Apart from this, this slogan was given by Modiji in 2011 itself
 congress ke paas naare kaa itnaa akaal pad gaya he ki ab wo modi ji kaa idia bhi chura rahe hai
 They should remove all the ministers and use them for slogan-making

 Kalpana Chawla died on 1 February i
e
 on this day
 vah antariksh main jane vaali pratham bhartiya mahila thi
 Kalpana not only achieved achievements in the world of space, but also taught all the students to live their dreams
 bhale hi 1 farvari 2003 ko colombia spes shatal ke durghatnagrast hone ke saath kalpana kii udaan ruk gai lekin aaj bhi vah duniya ke liye ek misaal hai
 His words became true in which he said that i am made for space only
 nasa vaigyanik or antariksh yatri kalpana chawla kaa janm haryana ke karnal main hua tha
 Kalpana was the first Indian woman to go into space (she took US citizenship)
 unke pita kaa naam banarsi laal chawla or maa kaa naam sanjyoti tha
 Kalpana married Jan Pier of France who was a flying instructor
 jaanate hai unke bare main
 
 
 Kalpana, born on 17 March 1962 at Banarasi Lal Chawla's house in Karnal, was the youngest of her four siblings
 punyatithi: aisa tha gandhi kaa jivan, inhone di thi rashtrapita kii oopaadhi- ghar main sab unhen pyaar se montu kehete the
 Initial studies took place at Tagore Bal Niketan of Karnal
 jab vah 8veen class main pahunchin to unhone apane pita se ejeeniyar banane kii ichha jaahir kii
 Kalpana's father wanted to make her a doctor or teacher
 parijanon kaa kahana he ki bachapan se hi kalpana kii dilchaspee antariksh or khagoleey parivartan main thi
 She often asked her father how these astronauts fly in the sky
 Can i fly too? His father used to defer to this matter with a laugh
 - kalpana phir apane sapanom ko saakaar karne 1982 main antariksh vigyaan kii padhai ke liye america ravaanaa hui
 Then in 1988 she became involved with NASA research
 jiske baad 1995 main nasa ne antariksh yatra ke liye kalpana chawla kaa chayan kiya
 - He took the first flight to space with the STS 87 Columbia Shuttle
 isaki avadhi 19 november 1997 se 5 disambar 1997 thi
 During his first trip to space, he spent 372 hours in space and completed 252 orbits of the Earth
 - is safal mishan ke baad kalpana ne antariksh ke liye duusari udaan colombia shatal 2003 se bhari
 Kalpana's second and last flight began on January 16, 2003 from the space shuttle Colombia
 yah 16 din kaa antariksh mishan tha, jo puri tarah se vigyaan or anusandhan par aadhaarit tha
 - On February 1, 2003, in order to return to Earth, the vehicle broke down and shattered as it entered the Earth's orbit
 kya hota he aarthik surveykshan, jaane- isse judi har baat- 2003 main is ghatana main kalpana ke saath 6 anya antariksh yatriyon kii bhi maut ho gai thi
 It was already decided that Kalpana Chawla's death, according to the media report, it was discovered that as soon as the Columbia Space Shuttle took flight, it would not land safely, it was decided that all the seven astronauts would face death
 phir bhi unhen isaki jaankaree nahin di gai
 This is surprising, but it is true
 iskaa khulaasa mishan colombia ke program manager ne kiya tha
 Every moment of space travel, Kalpana Chawla and her 6 companions walked the space in the shadow of death
 unhen isaki bhanak tak nahin lagane di gai ki wo surakshit dharti par nahin aa sakate
 He continued in his mission with life, he kept sending information from moment to moment, but in return, NASA did not even let him know that he had left the Earth forever, leaving pieces of his body Only remains to be returned
 us vakt sawaal ye tha ki aakhir nasa ne aisa kyon kiya? kyon usne chupa lee jaankaree antariksh yatriyon se or unke parivaar waalon se
 But the NASA scientific team did not want the astronauts on the mission to live the last moments of their lives
 unhone behatar yahi samajha ki haadase kaa shikaar hone se pehle tak wo mast rahe
 Death was to come anyway
 asafalataa se nahin ghabraati thim kalpanaapita bataate hai ki kalpana main kabhi aalas nahin tha
 He was not afraid of failure
 vah jo thaan leti use bas karke chhodti thi
 Today, Kalpana may not be among us, but she is an example for all of us

 Rana is arguing that since Headley is now in custody, "there is no risk that the accused's (rana's) alleged conduct may be repeated
" ’’is par abhiyojkon ne daleel di ki rana na keval hedli ke sampark main he balki abdur rahamaan hashim saiyad (pasha) ke bhi sidhe sampark main he, jiske khilaaf bhi aaropapatr daakhil kiya gaya lekin america adhikariyon ne abhi tak use giraftaar nahin kiya he

" ’’ naye aaropapatr main rana ko ‘person e’ naam se pahachaane gayi ek shaks se sidhe sampark main bataaya he

 In an application in a Chicago court on December 30, Rana sought the cancellation of his custody order
 rana ne apane vakil patric blegan ke jariye kaha tha ki kyonki vah pakistani sena kaa bhagoda he or uske paas lucatipi ke antarrashtriya khel ke liye vittiya sansaadhan nahin he, isliye muchalke par reeha kiye jane par vah desh se bhaagega nahin
 Rana's application also states that if he escapes to Pakistan or Canada, the US can use his extradition treaty from these countries to bring him back

 The corporation is also responsible for this, which in spite of adequate availability of water in Khandwa, neglected the traditional water sources and did not rectify the broken pipelines by pretending to be short of money

 On this, Ojha raises the question, "after all, in what capacity did the minister pressurize the corporation administration to pay the company and what was the reason behind doing so going contrary to the rules?" He also complained to the government, in which he alleged that the Vishwa utility was benefited by following rules and regulations
