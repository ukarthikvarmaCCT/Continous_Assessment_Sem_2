 The Ministry of Human Resources (HRD) is going to end the No Detention Policy (failure of Students till Class VIII)
 mantralay ise badalane yaa puri tarah se khatm karne ke liye kaaphi icchhuk he
 Especially in 5th and 8th class, there is also a lot of work going on to start the exam system and implement the pass fail system again
 khatm karne ke peeche kai takneekee adchane aaden aa rahi hai
 The most important thing in this is that if there is some change in this policy, then it is necessary to amend the Right to Education Act
 matlab bill sansad main pesh ho, paas ho or nae kanoon kaa notification jari kiya ja sake
 The way in which there is a constant deadlock in Parliament and many important bills are stuck, in this way, the passing of this bill is in itself a crook and can take a long time
 isi kaaran ab maanav sansaadhan mantralay is mudde par ab kanoon mantralay kii raay lene kii yojana bana rahaa he
 According to a high official of the Ministry, there is also a matter of asking the Law Ministry whether the exam system i
e
 Pass Fail in 5th and 8th class can be implemented as soon as possible through the Executive Order
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay isko lekar isliye bhi utsahit he kyoki 18 rajya jisamen kai congress shasit rajya bhi hai ne bhi isko lekar apni sahmati puri tarah se vyakt kar di he
 Two more states, including Karnataka, Telangana, are opposed to this and overall the ministry has received replies from 22 states
 ab duusare bache hue rajya or centre shasit pradeshon se jawaab aane baaki hai, lekin mantralay sutron ke anusaar zyaadatararajya shiksha mantrino ditension polisy ko khatm karne kii maang lambey samay se kar kar rahen hai
 Not long ago, in a meeting of the Central Advisory Board of Education, the education ministers, who came from 17 states, stood up and demanded the immediate abolition of the No Detention Policy
 sabhi kaa yahi maananaa he ki iske chalate na keval bachche padhai main dhyaan nahin den rahe unki parformens kam ho rahi hai balki teachers tak apni jimmedaari thik se nahin nibhaa rahe hai
 Many states also suggest that the examinations of 5th and 8th should start, but the children who fail can get a chance to give the exam again after a short time
 kai rajya exam ko 3veen kaksha se shuru karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 All the proposals have been evaluated by the five-member sub-committee constituted by Keb, the entire report has been prepared and now the discussion is going on how to implement it
 vaise yadi ek baar 5veen or 8veen ke exam shuru ho jate hai to 10veen ke board ke exam dobaaraa shuru hone kii kavayad teji se shuru hogi kyonki bahut se rajya isaki bhi maang kar rahe hai
 The Right to Education Act, enacted in 2009, was implemented nationwide on April 1, 2010, under which children between 6 and 14 years of age have the right to free education and should not fail in any class till the 8th

 The four students injured in the attack have been admitted to the hospital

 Family members of the children say that the careless attitude of the school as a whole is responsible in this case
 unka kahana he ki aakhir kaise ek chaatr skool main chaaku lekar ghus saktaa he or duusare chaatro par hamalaa kar saktaa he
 Police have registered a case against the student on the complaint of the school principal and arrested him
 police ab ghayal chaatro ke thik hone kaa intjaar kar rahi he jisase pataa chal sake ki un par hamalaa kyon kiya gaya
 Where he is being treated in ICU

 miyadi jamaa yani epady main tej giravat darj hui he
 • Unlike 2006 and 2010, for the first time, the cash flow in the market, ie the deposit has not increased even after the cash in hand
 • is saal janvari main bainkon kaa karj jamaa anupaat 47 saal ke sabase oonche str (78
 6 percent)
 yah oonchai bataati he ki jamaa kii tulana main karj dene kii raftaar bahut tej he jo ki baari jokhim kaa sanket he
 • Banks' loans go to the government, a handful of companies and some retail middle-class customers 
 bainkon kaa istemaal karne vaale 80 fisad log bainkon se koi karj nahin lete
 Those who save from the profits of banks get nothing
 keval byaaj unka sahaara he
 • In order to add new borrowers, it is necessary for banks to reduce the interest rate again and again to increase the flow of capital in the economy
 lekin karj sasta karne ke saath jamaa par byaaj dar kam hoti he
 After adding the repo rate to the loan rate, the return on bank deposits has further reduced
 • sarkaar sasta karj jhonk arthvyavastha ko chalaanaa chaahati he
 He relies on depositors' savings (loans from banks) for his expenses
 yahaan tak ki bainkon main nai puunji bhi ab unase hi paisa lekar (bond) daali jaati he
 • Governments created the entire system of proxy banking (NBFC) with the help of common man's capital deposited in banks, which has now sat down
 kheti se lekar udyog tak bainkon ke bakaayaa karj badhate yaa duubate chale ja rahe hai
 The capital of banks is shrinking due to dwindling deposits, which is why the government has tried to increase the capital base through the merger of banks
 • is maahaul main bank ke diposit graahakon kii chintaa dohari he
 The returns of her savings are also falling and she is also being robbed of debt, so banks are losing both trust and capital
 banking kaa model badale bina is chakravyuuh se nikalnaa mushkil he
 • Banks will have to increase non-deposit sources of resources
 pichhali sadi tak america main bainkon ke adhikansh sansaadhan diposit se aate the
 Banks, respectively, increased resource collection through the debt and bond markets from the Federal Reserve
 ab aadhe sansaadhan gaiyr diposit hai
 This has also reduced the cost of resources, reducing risks for depositors
 bharat main bainkon ko paardarshee banane, sarkaar kii hissedari ghataane or unhen bond bazaar main sakriy karne kii jarurat he taaki ve bazaar se puunji lekar karj den
 • Bank customers will have to expect a higher return on savings rather than a security cover
 achche ritern ke liye mutual fund or share bazaaron kii taraf janaa hoga
 • a limit for debt based investment will have to be fixed because now industries will have to take risk on their capital and not on depositors' money
 sanad rahe ki bank main bachat puri arthvyavastha or vittiya tantra (sarkaar kaa kharch, nijee udyogon ko karj, enbiensi kaa karj) kaa aadhaar he lekin iske baavjood khatra bainkon main rakhi aam logon kii jamaa par haragij nahin he
 The risk is that banks can no longer provide high returns on savings and cheaper loans at the same time, so the current crisis of banks has actually become an existential crisis for Indian banking

 priyadarshini mattu dushkarm or hatya ke maamle main umrakaid kii sajaa kaat rahe doshi santosh singh kii parole yachika par hoicourt ne usase apni padhai kaa puraa byora dene ko kaha he
 Santosh has asked for a week of parole from May 19 to deliver LLM papers
 22 may se uski ellem pariksha honi he
 Delhi High Court has asked Santosh in his reply to tell which course he has done in which year
 hoicourt ne use yah bataane ko bhi kaha he ki uski padhai kab tak puri hogi
 During the hearing on the bench of Justice Mukta Gupta, Delhi Police Standing Council Rahul Mehra said that Santosh Singh has been studying two years LLM course since 2012 and how much time it will take to complete it
 santosh ellem kii pariksha dene ke saath bihar main apane ek rishtedaar kii shaadi main shaamil hone ke liye bhi parole maang rahaa he
 He had earlier sought parole on the same basis

 Nowadays the trend of prisoners joining any course for parole is increasing
 lekim santosh ke vakil ne court ko kaha ki santosh do hisson main ellem kar rahaa he
 Earlier, he had surrendered at the end of the parole received
 donon pakshon ko sunne ke baad court ne kaha ki kisi ko padhai karne se nahin roka ja saktaa
 But the petitioner will have to tell how long his LLM will last
 jab ghatana hui thi, tab uski elelbi puri ho chuki thi or vah us samay bhi kanoon main kisi or paathyakram kii padhai kar rahaa tha
 Former IPS son Santosh was convicted for killing him in January 1996 after the rape of Priyadarshini Mattoo

 Devnagari Haridwar, the door to salvation
 manyata he ki haridwar main har kii paudi main ek dubkee janm-janmaantar ke paap dho detii he
 The priests of the same Haridwar and Rishikesh ashrams and trusts are busy whiteening the black earnings of the people
 dharm ke thekedaar bane in trust or ashram ke manager baba logon ke kaledhan ko safed karne ke jugad maikenic bane hue hai
 The special investigative report of our colleague Chanak Aaj Tak has exposed the faces of people who are engaged in wrongdoing sitting in the courtyard of religion
 is report main ye khulaasa hua he ki ye log kaledhan ke kuberon shah de rahe hai taaki kaledhan ke khilaaf pradhanmantri narendra modi kii ladaai kamjor ho sake
 Sachchha Dham Ashram, Laxman Jhoola, Laxman Jhule in Rishikesh Rishikesh is near the Sachdham Ashram, Aaj Tak's undercover team arrived as a businessman
 sabase pehle hamaari mulaakaat ashram ke sevadaar bhupasingh se hui
 We told Bhup Singh that we have come there to make black money worth crores of rupees white and demonetisation has given us a lot of work
 bhupasingh ne ashram ke manager ramesh se hamaari mulaakaat karvaa di
 Warned us to talk straight away
 iskaa matlab tha ki kamishan or kaledhan ko kaise thikaana lagaana he is par baat saaf-saaf kar len, taaki baad main koi kanfusion naa rahe
 Here our team was taken to room number 11 of the ashram
 ham or ashram ke manager jaise hi kamare main ghuse or baahar se bhupasingh ne daravaaje kii kundi laga di
 Here the manager Ramesh came straight to the point
 wo kaledhan ko white karne ke kai jugad hame bataane laga
 The commission amount was different to fit each jugaad
 ramesh kaa daawa tha ki uske jaankaar ke paas aisa bank acount he jiske bare main rigerv bank ko bhi nahin pataa
 Very easily, he will get us RTGS from that account by taking black money
 reporter-artijies ho jayega
 Ramesh, Manager (sacha Dham) - will be RTGS
 us acount se koi dikkt nahin hogi
 Reporter-complete will be ten million
 ramesh-haa ho jayega
 If you give one, you will also take some commission in it
 reporter-haa, kitna kamishan lenge
 ramesh-commission
 
 
 abhi yahaan kaa rate 30 or 5 kaa he
 Reporters-30 and 5 means -30, so they will keep and 5 is for the middle ones
 reporter-acha, thik he
 Like the jugaad mechanic who managed to manage Ramesh Blackmani, the manager of the Sachdham Ashram, claims were being made
 hamane ek karod rupye kii kaali kamai ko white karan kii maang kii
 He quickly agreed to it
 hame bataaya ki unke conection haridwar se lekar dilli tak hai
 They demanded separate commissions for new notes of 500 and 2000 rupees
 ek karod main 45 lakh rupee dallali ke taur par rakhane kii deal ramesh karne lage
 According to this deal, it was our responsibility to carry the money
 ramesh-lekin bade vaale ke 40+5 = 45 he
 If you want new notes, then 
 
 500-2000 rupee ke to 45 kaa rate he
 reporter-yanirmesh-if you give one, 55 will come back to you
 reporter-ek karod main 55 lakh hamen milegaa
 Ramesh- Well, what other people are doing in Haridwar, they are doing little
 25-30 lakh or wo 25+5 main kar rahe hai
 Reporter-25 + 5 Meaning
 ramesh-total 30 aapkaa rakhenge, 70 waapas kar denge
 Reporter - Who is doing this? Ramesh - This is where the people of the ashram are doing it
 reporter-ashram se hi karvaa dijie
 It is your job to carry ramesh-lana
 reporter-thik he
 They will tell Ramesh-place
 ashram ke manager ramesh se hamaari dling chal hi rahi thi, tabhi ramesh ko ek phone aayaa
 Without hesitation, Ramesh began to offer blackmoney on the phone as well
 unhone haridwar, agra or dilli main kahin bhi blikemani ko thikaane laga kar artijies karne kaa prastaav de diya
 Read here what he talked on the phone
 
 
 ramesh-kitna he vahaan

 acha
 
 
 There is no one to know there
 
 
 dilli or agra main he apane paas or haridwar main he
 Haridwar will make RTGS, give it to him, just in some way he will make RTGS
 wo percent bhi nahin legaa, 10-20 percent main hi de degaa
 When Ramesh, the manager of the Sacha Dham Ashram was convinced of us, he met us with retired policeman R
 tyaagi se karwaai
 R
 tyaagi ne hame bataaya ki usne 2005 main police kii naukari se viares le liya tha or aajkal wo ashram se judaa hua he
 We created a story in front of it that we have brought one crore rupees to Haridwar
 ise sunate hi wo turant bole ise to main subah hi white kara duungaa
 He offered us that in return for this, cut the brokerage and get the amount in the bank account to RTGS or get the cash
 hamane cash kii maang kii to tyaagi ne kahaan thik he or ye bhi kah diya ki wo 500 or 2000 rupye ke nae note muhaiyaa karaane kii koshish karenge
 R
 tyaagi, ritred pulicekarmi-artijies lenaa chaahate ho yaa cash lenaa chaahate ho?reporter-cash dilava dijie
 R
 tyaagi-cash le lo aap
 Will get two thousand k, will try 500 k also
 nai karency dilava denge aapako
 Reporter - New Currency Tyagi - Two thousand rupees, now something is going to stop even 100-50 notes, because it has no idea when to rule
 100 ke karvaa liye phir aapke liye samasya khadi ho jaaegi
 R
 In our conversation
 tyaagi ne daawa kiya ki uski bank main jabardast setting he
 He will make black mannee white in a few hours
 hamane usase poocha ki bank main logon kii line lagi he, paise logon kii zarurat se bhi kam aa rahe hai
 In such a situation, how will he make black money of one crore white
 usne hame bataaya ki back ke bheetar sab ho rahaa he
 The public may not be getting the money, but their managers are getting a lot of money
 reporter-bank se itnaa paisa mil jayega?aar
 Will leave ab jo kar rahe he wo liye baithe hai
 Where is the money coming to the reporter-bank? R
 tyaagi-public ke liye nahin aa rahaa he, baaki to ho rahaa he sab chal rahaa he
 Reporter - lest you get trapped in a bank? tyaagi-nahin, aapako to kahin nahin janaa aapako to jahaan baitha denge vahiin baithe rahanaa
 Sachdadham Ashram is not the only ashram in Rishikesh, where Baba who whitens blackmoney is active
 sachchadham ashram ke sevadaar bhupasingh ne ek aise hi trust ke manager se hamaari mulaakaat karwaai
 Bhup Singh called the manager of the Baba Kali Kamali Trust Trust, Jayaprakash, to call him at the Sachdham Ashram
 sevadaar bhupasingh ne jaiprakash ko kahaan ki wo apane trust kii madad se hamaari kaali kamai ko thikaane lagava de, jiske badale main un donon kaa bhi phayda ho jayega
 Jaiprakash told Bhup Singh, don't worry, he will get this work done

 Jaiprakash - how much is it? Bhup Singh-ek

 jaiprakash-main phone karke bataata hum
 a few seconds later Jayaprakash returned to the room
 usne hamen aagaah bhi kiya ki ham trust ke chakkar main naa pade
 He will provide many accounts and put our money in it and will make our black money white
 hamane inkaar kiya to wo khud hi kaali kamali vaale trust kii pole kholane laga
 Jayaprakash - These are as badass as the trustees

 He will not even take the template
 lekin kisi or se karoge naa to

 jaiprakash ne yahaan bataaya ki uske trust main donneton kii rakam notebandi lagu hone ke pehle kii taarikh main cat rahi he, taaki logon ke blikemani ko thikaane lagaaya ja sake
 The way in which Jayaprakash was talking to us, we realized that this business is shining brightly in the garb of ashrams and temples in Haridwar and Rishikesh
 kailashanand mishan trust, lakshmana jhula, rishikepub ham rishikesh ke lakshmana jhula par bane prasiddh omkareshwar mandir kii dekh rekh karne vaale kailashanand mishan trust main baithe dallalon kaa khulaasa karte hai

 New rules are changing every day

 Kamaldeep Joshi - You are lying too much

 Rathore, Kailashanand Mission Trust - We do not have God, leave some scope
 kamaldeep joshi-aap let mat karo
 Jashpal - The person who will take the most, is doing it, he will take 50%
 kamaldeep joshi-dekhon aapke paas time kam he
 Whatever comes to your hand is yours
 baaki ye he ki ye trust he
 How much will we be able to distribute our share? 4-5 lakh baant paaenge
 We will be as many as 10-15 men among ourselves
 5 lakh ke chakkar main trust to 50-60 lakh rupee tak khapa denge
 In this way we talked about 60 lakhs
 inhone hamen chetaya ki ye mandir yaa trust main nahin milenge
 He immediately fixed up to the place of the deal
 maamle kii gambhirtha ko samajhane ke liye inhone hamen ye bhi kaha ki ye paise lekar mulaakaat yahaan nahi karenge, balki kisi dur daraaj kii pahari par yaa phir kisi jaankaar ke ghar yaa restra main note kii khep kaa len dein karenge
 Kamaldeep Joshi - But we will never tell you on the phone, nor will we meet you here
 reporter-thik harrmaladeep joshi-ham milenge out aria main, malatab shyampur said main yaa phir kahin par idhar nahin
 The more fear you have, the more fear we have

 More than 3 thousand private schools have been disrupted in Delhi
 skool management se lekar bachche or unke parents tak sabhi ghabaraae hue hai
 The reason is that the Delhi government has ordered to shut them down
 ye sabhi skool bajet skool hai yani aise skool jo chote hai, gharon main chalate hai or jinhen manyata praapt nahin he
 In fact, the Delhi government has issued a circular saying that all such schools will be closed by 31 March
 purvi dilli ke ek aise hi bajet skool main 'ajtak' kii team pahunchi jisamen 300 se zyada bachche padhate hai
 Looking at it from a distance, it seemed that the level of studies in school would not be very good, but when i went to class and looked at it, it was a surprise
 bachche kisi bade praivet skulon kii tarah hi angreji main baat karte mili
 However, most of the parents who come here come from poor class, whose monthly income is only 5 to 10 thousand rupees
 skool main apane bachche ko padhaane vaale ek parent ne bataaya ki ghar ke mukhiya privet naukari karte hai or selary 8000 rupaye he
 In such a situation, the child is being taught in a private school near the house
 zyaadaatar parents kehete hai ki sarkari skool to paas main he lekin vahaan kii shiksha kisi se chuphi nahin hui he yahambacchon ko acchhee shikshamil rahi he or bachche saamne nigaraanee main bhi hai
 At the same time, the people running the school say that we are ready to close the school today if the government guarantees to provide good education to these children
 kai skool sanchaalkon kaa kahana he ki vah no proffit nolej kii tarj par yah skool chalaate hai prati bachche mahaj 300 se 400 fees lete hai, aise main skool band hone se shikshakon kii naukari bhi chali jaaegi
 Actually 10 lakh children study in these budget schools of Delhi, while around 30 thousand teachers are connected with these schools
 aise main skool band hone se bacchon ke saath-saath itane shikshakon ke rojgaar par bhi asar padegaa
 If this decision is implemented, not only is it going to have a big impact on one million children, but thousands of families may also face employment crisis
 agar aap sona kharidne ja rahe hai to abhi ruk jaaiye kyonki sone kii keemton main aa sakati he badi giravat
 If the actual gold found in the excavation in Daundia Kheda village of Unnao, then the price of gold per 10 grams, not one or two, may fall by up to Rs 5,000
 gharelu bazaaron main abhi prati das gram sone ke keemat 29,500 rupee hai, aise main prati 10 gram sone kii keemat ghatakar takreeban 25
 000 will come at Rs
 sona milane se videshi bazaaron main bhi sone kii keemat main kami aegi
 According to experts, the price of gold in foreign markets can decrease by up to $ 65 per ounce
 videshi bazaaron main prati ounce sone kii keemat abhi 1,315 dollar he
 Vandana Bharti, head of commodities fundamentals of investment company SMC Global, says that if gold is found in digging, the price of gold in domestic markets can reach Rs 25,000 per ten grams, while the price of gold per ounce in foreign markets can be reduced from $ 1,315 Can come up to $ 1,250
 haalanki bullian marchent association kii raay is par alag he
 Association's General Secretary Srikrishna Goyal Chandiwala says that since this gold will go directly into the treasury of the Reserve Bank, there will be no major difference in the prices of gold
 jaisi kii sambhaavna he puraane mandir ke paas chal rahi khudaai main 1,000 ton sona mil saktaa he, jisaki bazaar keemat abhi 29 kharab rupee aanki ja rahi he
 Significantly, the Reserve Bank currently has only 557 tonnes of gold
 rupaya bhi hoga majbootakhudai main sona milane se na keval sona sasta hoga balki ek sambhaavna isaki bhi he ki isse dollar ke mukaable rupee main bhi majbootee aegi
 According to experts, this will strengthen the rupee by about 20 percent
 abhi ek dollar kii keemtlagbhag 62 rupee he, aise main yah ghatakar 50 rupee ho jaaegi
 With the availability of gold, the amount of gold in the treasury of the Reserve Bank will increase, so the rupee is sure to strengthen
 pichley paanch saalon se dollar ke mukaable rupee main lagaataar giravat aa rahi he, aise main agar sona mil jaataa he or dollar ke mukaable rupee main sudhaar aata he to bhartiya sarkaar ke liye yah ek badi raahat kii baat hogi
 The whole country is waiting for which party the people will elect in Lok Sabha elections 2019 and whose government will be formed at the center
 yah intjaar 23 may ko khatm ho jayega jab chunaav ayog voton kii ginati karegaa or nattejey ghoshit karegaa
 But even on the day of counting, more will have to wait for the final results
 chunaav ayog ne bataaya he ki deshbhar kii loksabhaa siton par hue matdaan ke jo nattejey 23 may ko ghoshit kiye jaaenge unamem thodaa zyada vakt lag saktaa he
 The big reason for this is that VVPAT is to be matched with EVM votes, which will take a little longer
 upachunaav ayukta sudeep jain ne ajtak se baatcheet main isaki pushti kii
 Sudeep Jain said that this time there may be some delay in the election results
 unke mutabik, ye nattejey is baar 4-5 ghante deree se aa sakate hai
 Sudeep Jain said that the delay may be due to the matching of EVM and VVPAT votes
 bataa den ki maujuuda loksabhaa chunaav main iviem ke saath vivipat mashiinon kaa bhi istemaal kiya gaya he
 Due to which the slip has also come out on casting the vote
 aise main jab 23 may ko voton kii ginati kii jaaegi to iviem main pade voton se parchiyon kaa milan bhi kiya jayega
 After complaints of disturbances in evms, the Election Commission had decided to install VVPAT with evms
 bataa den ki pehle har seat par ek iviem ke saath ek vivipat lagaai jaati thi, jise vipaksh kii maang ke baad badhaakar har vidhansabha main 5 diya gaya
 However, opposition parties are still seeking to increase VVPAT
 vipakshi dalon ne supreme court main bhi guhaar lagaai he ki iviem ke saath pachaas fisadi vivipat lagaai jaaen
 The Supreme Court rejected the opposition's demand on May 7, after which the opposition parties turned to the Election Commission
 baharhaal, paanch charnon kaa matdaan puraa ho chukaa he
 Now there are two more stages
 aise main maujuuda chunaav ke lihaaj se vipakshi dalon kii is maang kaa chunaav ayog par kitna asar hota he, ye charchaa kaa vishay he
 But the Commission has admittedly delayed the results due to VVPAT
 yani 23 may ko chunaav nateezon kaa intjaar karne vaale logon ko thodaa or zyada intjaar karnaa pad saktaa he

 There was a time when Vinod Khanna was called Most Handsome Villain in the world of cinema, then came into the role of Hero, then he got the title of Most Goodlucking Hero in the 70s
 is daur main wo amitabh bachchan jaise engri yangamain ke sabase bade muqabledaar maane gaye
 Then the mind suddenly got bored by the glare of stardom, then took retirement
 tab unase judi khabaren sexi sanyasi jaise khitaab ke saath chapa karti thim
 In the 1973 Gulzar film Suddenly, Vinod Khanna played the role of a hero who kills his wife who loves someone else after marriage, but the audience's sympathy is not less than his hero
 dhire-dhire darshakon ke pyaar ke saath wo hero parade par aise paravaan chadhataa he, ki box offis par filmein uske dam par chalane lagati hai
 The 1974 film Imtihaan is an example of this
 us daur main badhati vinod khanna kii lokapriyata kii ek misaal haath kii safai naam kii film bhi he
 The 1974 film was made by director Prakash Mehra, who made Amitabh Bachchan a superstar from a film called Zanjeer
 ye film bhi zanjeer kii tarah superhit rahi
 That success made Vinod Khanna's image as a hero and strong
 ye chhavi itani majboot thi ki cinema ke jis daur main box offis par sikaa sabase zyada amitabh bachchan kaa chalata tha, us daur main vinod khanna engri yangamain ke sabase bade muqabledaar maane gaye
 Vinod Khanna's presence in front of Amitabh in blood sweat was equal
 us baraabar kii takkar ke baad amitabh ke ek or mureed director manmohan desai kii najar vinod khanna par gai
 After this, the role of Vinod Khanna in every film of Amitabh was confirmed
 manmohan desai ne unhen amar akbar anthony ke baad parvarish jaisi film main amitabh ke saath doharaaya
 So Prakash Mehra once again tried him in 'muqaddar Ka Sikandar'
 in chaaron filmon main sahaayak hero kii bhoomika karte hue bhi vinod khanna amitabh ke barabari karte najar aae
 Vinod Khanna also had his own different star status in that era with equal competition to Amitabh
 is haisiyat ke saath vinod khanna kii do-teen film har saal superhit hoti thi
 However, in this period, solo hero films Vinod Khanna was rarely received
 lekin apane chaahane waalon kii najar main iklaute hero the, jo amitabh ke superstaradam ko bhi peeche chhod sakate the
 Who then knew that at that height of superstardom, the mind of that hero is getting lost in the complexities of his own mind
 cinema ko lekar uski soch kamyaabi shoharat or superstadam kii kaamana se kahin aage nikal chuki thi
 In those years of 1978-79, Vinod Khanna's mind started leaning towards spirituality
 unhone kaha tha-mujhe aisa lagane laga tha jaise main koi mashin ho gaya hum
 i had no control over emotions like anger, love and laughter
 aisa lagata tha jaise koi batan dabaata he or main ection main aa jaataa hum
 Unlike cinematic action and mainstream glare, films like Meera and Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki started giving him more relief
 yun kahen ki vinod khanna kaa man cinema kii duniya se ubane laga tha
 This thing was surprising to anyone, from the turn that the hero had to reach the stage of superstardom, some thought was coming at that point

 According to Dubey, despite being backward, Bahera village is indeed an ideal village

 Behera village may have been crime-free for years, but it is not that people like other villages do not have mutual estrangement
 agar kabhi kisi ke bich manmutav ho bhi gaya to gaanv ke bade-bujurg or panchayat, gaanv kii sarhad ke andar hi maamla sulajhza dete hai yani thane jaakar report likhavane kii naubat nahin aati
 The elders have resolved the dispute
 One villager Lalmani said, "like other villages, there is a rift between people in our village too, but we do not go to the police station on the matter and place the issue with the elders of the village
 bade-bujurg jo faisla karte hai, donon paksh khushi-khushi use sweekaar kar lete hai
 "another villager Siyaram said," Our village has got a distinct identity in the surrounding area due to the respect and trust of elders

 The most interesting fact was that it was his first three balls, and he was banned by umpire Johann Cloete before throwing a single legitimate ball, so his bowling figures (0–0–8–0) became extremely interesting
 antarrashtriya cricket parishad ke niyamon ke anusaar, ek-divasiy maichon main kisi bhi gendbaaj ko akraman se hataaya ja saktaa he, agar vah kisi bhi ek over main ballebaaj kii qamar se upar ek se adhik phultos gend phenkata he
 In fact, the first ball of Rahman, which was thrown to Bangladeshi batsman Imrul Kayes, was missed by his hand, and he went very high and out of the wicket, which umpire Cloete declared as a no-ball
 uski duusari gend sidhi thi, or chaati kii oonchai par phenki gai
 Kayes played the next leg backwards, but was caught at midwicket
 haalanki maidani ampairon ne kayes ko rukne kaa ishaara kiya, or riple se pushti ho gai ki vah duusari no-ball thi
 Umpire Johann Kloyte then spoke to Pakistani captain Misbah ul-haq, and taking a soft stance, allowed Abdur Rahman to continue bowling, but immediately Rahman bowled a third high full-on, which Anamul Haq hit midwicket Departed for fours
 iske turant baad ampaire cloyte ne misabah ul-haq ko bulaayaa or bataaya ki ab rahamaan ko gendbaaji karne kii anumati nahin di ja sakati, so, fawaad alam ko bulaakar over puraa karwaanaa padaa
 Rahman was included in the Pakistani team in place of Junaid Khan, who has been rested

 He said, "we don't have any superstars other than Rahul, but all the players are contributing to the team and that's the beauty of our team
" ’shah ne yah bhi kaha ki rajasthan kii team bhaagyashaalee rahi ki use pehle ballebaaji karne kaa mauka mila kyonki baad main lakshya kaa peechha karnaa mushkil ho gaya tha

 When did the tone of disagreement get so much prominence in the decisions of the bench coming from the Supreme Court
 faisla bench kii bahumat kaa hi mana jayega magar asahmati zaahir karne vaale jajon kii tippaniyan bhi us faisle ke samanaantar khadi ho gai he
 This is a good opportunity to see the Supreme Court Judgment through these unsympathetic arguments
 justise di vaai chandchur ne aadhaar or bhima koregaanv main asahmati kii tippanee likhte hue jo baaten kahi hai wo kanoon ke jaankaron ko lambey samay tak baichaiyn karti rahengi
 Justice Abdul Nazeer recorded dissenting remarks in a three-judge bench in the Ayodhya case
 justise indu malhotra ne sabarimala mandir maamle main asahmati kii tippanee darj kii he
 First we will look at the comments of dissent of Justice Abdul Nazeer and Justice Indu Malhotra in different cases and in different benches
 27 sitambar ko ayodhya maamle main teen jajon kii bench ne 1994 ke faisle ko sahi mana ki masjid islam kaa anivaary yaa abhinn hissaa nahin he
 Namaz can be read anywhere and there is no need to send it to the bench of five judges
 is bench main asahmati zaahir karte hue justise abdul nazir ne kaha ki is masale ke sanvaidhanik mahatv or praasangikta ko dekhte hue badi bench ke paas bheja janaa chahie
 To see if some religious practices can be examined without a detailed test of faith in the light of the Sriur Math and other such cases? Whether a practice is an essential part of a religion or not, is the test required or not? Does Articles 15, 25 and 26 that should be read along with Articles 14 allow for the comparative importance of beliefs? Now on September 28, 10 to 50-year-old women were allowed entry into the Sabarimala temple, when the member of that bench, Justice Indu Malhotra, disagreed
 bahumat kaa faisla yahi rahaa ki umr ko lekar jo pabandi lagaai gai he ki vah dharmik pratha kaa anivaary yaa abhinn ang nahin he
 No customs can violate the fundamental rights acquired from the constitution
 justise chandchur ne kaha ki maahvaaree ke samay auraton ko puja se rokna unke saath achhut jaisaa bartaav karnaa he
 In a five-judge bench, Justice Indu Malhotra disagreed
 kya justise indu malhotra vahi baat nahin kah rahi hai jo justise nazir ne kahi
 Justice Indu Malhotra said that this case will affect not only Sabarimala but other places of worship
 dharmik prathaon ko artical 14 ke paimaane par nahin parkhaa ja saktaa
 Only a religious community should decide what are the compulsory or integral religious practices within it
 hamen ek taraf dharmi manyataon ke bich santulan kaayam karnaa he or duusari taraf samvidhan ke tahat kisi se bhedbhaav na karne ke siddhanton ko bhi lagu karnaa he
 On the other hand, Justice Chandchud has also said the same thing as Justice Indu Malhotra in investigating the essential aspect of which religion
 is tarah se aap dekhen to koi pratha kisi dharm kaa anivaary hissaa he yaa nahin ise lekar teen jajon kii raay ek jaisi he
 In prime time on Ismail Farooqui's decision, constitution expert Faizan Mustafa had said that the Supreme Court should not decide any issue on the basis of religious imperatives
 faizan mustafaa yah kahana chaahate he ki islam kaa kya hissaa he yah tay karne ke bajaae adaalat sidhaa kah sakati thi ki sarkaar ko kisi mandir or masjid ke adhigrahan kaa paryaapt kanoonee adhikaar he
 We asked Faizan Mustafa whether it was okay for me to think about disagreements in different matters
 ab supreme court ke ek duusare bade faisle par aate hai
 a bench of Justices Deepak Mishra, Justice AM Kharmilkar and Justice Chanchur ruled out a SIT to investigate the arrest activists and lawyers in the Bhima Koregaon case, giving a verdict of two each
 justise khanvilakar ne apane faisle main kaha ki chaar hafte or ye ectvist nazarband rahenge
 The court also warned the police to avoid fabricating fabricated and fake evidence against the accused activists
 agar saboot managasaint paae gaye to adaalat in chhapemariyon kii jaanch ke liye es ai tii bana degi
 So in a way, the court did not listen to SIT but also said that if Fazchwada is there, they will also make SIT
 justise chandchur kii asahmati ne kaha ki asahmati ke naam par vipaksh kii awaz ko nahin kuchlaa ja saktaa he
 If freedom is crushed now, it cannot be repaid later
 maharashtra police ke bartaav se nishpaksh jaanch ko lekar sawaal uthte hai
 The Maharashtra Police stated its stand that those arrested were related to the banned terrorist organization and were part of a larger conspiracy
 supreme court ne yah sunate hue kaha ki kisi kii azaadi anumaanon ke aadhaar par nahin kuchli ja sakati he
 We will keep an eye on this matter
 aap jaanate hai ki giraftaar activist sudhaa bharadwar, varvara raav, gautam navalkha, arun farera, vernon gozalvis kii taraf se professor romila thapar,devaki jain, prabhaat patnayak satish deshpandey or majaa daaruwala ne yachika daayar kii thi
 He prominently highlighted Justice Chandchud's remarks during a press conference in which he has said that he does not agree with the government side that the third party does not interfere in the case of the petitioners
 jab sanvaidhanik adhikaron ko hanan ho rahaa ho, swatantraaa par aghat pahunchaaya ja rahaa ho to insaaf ke raste main technical baaten roda nahin ban sakati hai
 The petitioners made their stand in the Press Club after the court's decision
 iske alaava justise chandchur kii tippanee kii kaaphi charchaa he
 Justice Chandchud has said that the only way to balance between the two lies is that the investigation should be done in a fair and independent manner
 lekin main siddhant rup se apane do saathi jajon se sahamat nahin hum
 The comments justise di vaai chandchur ne es ai tii se jaanch karaane ke paksh main kai udhaaharan die magar faisle main ise sweekaar nahin kiya gaya
 Justice Chandchud has made serious remarks on the role of Maharashtra Police and said that on 29 August 2018, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Maharashtra government and others
 faisle ke chand ghante ke bheetar pune main joint kamishnar shivarirao bhodke ne press conference kar di jisamen daawa kiya ki pune police ke paas paryaapt saboot hai
 While the court stayed the transit of these five people
 ghar main nazarband kiya tha
 This police behavior was inappropriate
 aisa laga ki police court ke notice kaa jawaab electranik media ke zarie de rahi he
 On August 31, 2018, ADG Law and Order Shri Paramveer Singh ADG also held a press conference and showed many letters which were not even forensic examined
 
 On June 8, a letter from Sudha was issued to the media before the court proceedings commenced
 aarope tha ki giraftaar log pradhanmantri par hamalaa karnaa chaahate hai
 This letter was shown on TV
 jabaki in patron ko court ke saamne nahin rakhaa gaya
 Nor did transit demand form part of the application
 yah kaaphi gambhir maamla he
 This casts doubt on the fairness of the investigation
 police jaj nahin he
 Politics is interpreting differently and law experts are interpreting differently
 in badi badi baton ke bich bihar ke 80,000 chaatr pareshaan hai ki 1 aktubar ke pehle admit card nahin aayaa to unke jivan kaa ek saal barbaad ho jayega
 On the other hand, the teachers of UP are upset that those who did not take the exam passed in competition
 27 sitambar ko ayodhya maamle main teen jajon kii bench ne 1994 ke faisle ko sahi mana ki masjid islam kaa anivaary yaa abhinn hissaa nahin he
 Namaz can be read anywhere and there is no need to send it to the bench of five judges
 is bench main asahmati zaahir karte hue justise abdul nazir ne kaha ki is masale ke sanvaidhanik mahatv or praasangikta ko dekhte hue badi bench ke paas bheja janaa chahie
 To see if some religious practices can be examined without a detailed test of faith in the light of the Sriur Math and other such cases? Whether a practice is an essential part of a religion or not, is the test required or not? Does Articles 15, 25 and 26 that should be read along with Articles 14 allow for the comparative importance of beliefs? Now on September 28, 10 to 50-year-old women were allowed entry into the Sabarimala temple, when the member of that bench, Justice Indu Malhotra, disagreed
 bahumat kaa faisla yahi rahaa ki umr ko lekar jo pabandi lagaai gai he ki vah dharmik pratha kaa anivaary yaa abhinn ang nahin he
 No customs can violate the fundamental rights acquired from the constitution
 justise chandchur ne kaha ki maahvaaree ke samay auraton ko puja se rokna unke saath achhut jaisaa bartaav karnaa he
 In a five-judge bench, Justice Indu Malhotra disagreed
 kya justise indu malhotra vahi baat nahin kah rahi hai jo justise nazir ne kahi
 Justice Indu Malhotra said that this case will affect not only Sabarimala but other places of worship
 dharmik prathaon ko artical 14 ke paimaane par nahin parkhaa ja saktaa
 Only a religious community should decide what are the compulsory or integral religious practices within it
 hamen ek taraf dharmi manyataon ke bich santulan kaayam karnaa he or duusari taraf samvidhan ke tahat kisi se bhedbhaav na karne ke siddhanton ko bhi lagu karnaa he
 On the other hand, Justice Chandchud has also said the same thing as Justice Indu Malhotra in investigating the essential aspect of which religion
 is tarah se aap dekhen to koi pratha kisi dharm kaa anivaary hissaa he yaa nahin ise lekar teen jajon kii raay ek jaisi he
 In prime time on Ismail Farooqui's decision, constitution expert Faizan Mustafa had said that the Supreme Court should not decide any issue on the basis of religious imperatives
 faizan mustafaa yah kahana chaahate he ki islam kaa kya hissaa he yah tay karne ke bajaae adaalat sidhaa kah sakati thi ki sarkaar ko kisi mandir or masjid ke adhigrahan kaa paryaapt kanoonee adhikaar he
 We asked Faizan Mustafa whether it was okay for me to think about disagreements in different matters

 justise khanvilakar ne apane faisle main kaha ki chaar hafte or ye ectvist nazarband rahenge
 The court also warned the police to avoid fabricating fabricated and fake evidence against the accused activists
 agar saboot managasaint paae gaye to adaalat in chhapemariyon kii jaanch ke liye es ai tii bana degi
 So in a way, the court did not listen to SIT but also said that if Fazchwada is there, they will also make SIT
 justise chandchur kii asahmati ne kaha ki asahmati ke naam par vipaksh kii awaz ko nahin kuchlaa ja saktaa he
 If freedom is crushed now, it cannot be repaid later
 maharashtra police ke bartaav se nishpaksh jaanch ko lekar sawaal uthte hai
 The Maharashtra Police stated its stand that those arrested were related to the banned terrorist organization and were part of a larger conspiracy
 supreme court ne yah sunate hue kaha ki kisi kii azaadi anumaanon ke aadhaar par nahin kuchli ja sakati he
 We will keep an eye on this matter

 He prominently highlighted Justice Chandchud's remarks during a press conference in which he has said that he does not agree with the government side that the third party does not interfere in the case of the petitioners
 jab sanvaidhanik adhikaron ko hanan ho rahaa ho, swatantraaa par aghat pahunchaaya ja rahaa ho to insaaf ke raste main technical baaten roda nahin ban sakati hai
 The petitioners made their stand in the Press Club after the court's decision
 iske alaava justise chandchur kii tippanee kii kaaphi charchaa he
 Justice Chandchud has said that the only way to balance between the two lies is that the investigation should be done in a fair and independent manner
 lekin main siddhant rup se apane do saathi jajon se sahamat nahin hum
 The comments justise di vaai chandchur ne es ai tii se jaanch karaane ke paksh main kai udhaaharan die magar faisle main ise sweekaar nahin kiya gaya
 Justice Chandchud has made serious remarks on the role of Maharashtra Police and said that on 29 August 2018, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Maharashtra government and others
 faisle ke chand ghante ke bheetar pune main joint kamishnar shivarirao bhodke ne press conference kar di jisamen daawa kiya ki pune police ke paas paryaapt saboot hai
 While the court stayed the transit of these five people

 This police behavior was inappropriate

 On the other hand, the teachers of UP are upset that those who did not take the exam passed in competition
 vahiin justise chandchur ne bhi kis dharm ke anivaary pahalu kii jaanch ke maamle main justise indu malhotra ke jaisi hi baat kahi he
 In this way, if you look at whether a practice is an essential part of a religion or not, the opinion of the three judges is the same
 ismail faruki vaale faisle par prime time main samvidhan visheshgy faizan mustafa ne kaha tha ki supreme court ko dharmik anivaaryta ke aadhaar par kisi masale ko tay nahin karnaa chahie
 Faizan Mustafa wants to say that instead of deciding what is part of Islam, the court could have said directly that the government has sufficient legal right to acquire a temple and mosque
 hamane faizan mustafa se poocha ki kya alag alag maamalon main asahmatiyon ko lekar meraa sochna thik he
 Now come to another major decision of the Supreme Court
 justise deepak mishra, justise e em khanvilakar or justise chanchud kii bench ne do ek ke bahumat se faisla dete hue bhima koregaanv maamle main giraptaar ectvist or vakeelon kii jaanch ke liye es ai tii banane se inkaar kar diya
 Justice Kharamilkar said in his judgment that four more weeks these activists will remain under house arrest
 adaalat ne police ko chetavanee bhi di ki aaropee activiston ke khilaaf managasaint or nakli saboot jamaa karase bache
 If evidence is found concocted, the court will make SIT to investigate these raids
 to ek tarah se adaalat ne es ai tii kii baat nahin maani lekin yah bhi kah diya ki fazachwada hoga to es ai tii bana bhi denge
 Justice Chandchud's disagreement said that the voice of the opposition cannot be crushed in the name of disagreement
 abhi azaadi kuchli jaaegi to uski bharpai baad main nahin ho sakati he
 The Maharashtra Police's behavior raises questions about a fair investigation
 maharashtra police ne apana paksh rakhte hue kaha ki jinaki giraftaar hui he unka sambandh pratibandhit aatanki sanghathan se tha or ye badi saazish kaa hissaa the
 The Supreme Court heard that someone's freedom cannot be crushed on the basis of estimates
 ham is maamle main apni nigaah rakhenge
 You are aware that on behalf of the arrested activists Sudha Bhardwar, Varavara Rao, Gautam Navlakha, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gozalvis, Professor Romila Thapar, Devaki Jain, Prabhat Patnaik Satish Deshpande and Maja Daruwala filed the petition
 inhone press conference karte hue justise chandchur kii tippanee ko hi pramukhataa se ubhaara jisamen unhone kaha he ki ve sarkari paksh kii is baat se sahamat nahin he ki third paati yachikakartaon kii is cese main koi dakhal nahin banati he
 When constitutional rights are being violated, freedom is being attacked, then technical things cannot be obstructed in the way of justice
 yachikakartaon ne adaalat ke faisle ke baad press club main apni baat rakhi
 Apart from this, there is a lot of discussion of Justice Chandchud's comment
 justise chandchur ne kaha he ki do jhooth ke bich santulan kaa yahi tarika he ki jaanch nishpaksh or swatantra tareeke se ho
 But i in principle do not agree with my two fellow judges
 tippaniyan Justice DY Chandchud gave many examples in favor of conducting an inquiry by SIT but it was not accepted in the judgment
 maharashtra police kii bhoomika par justise chandchur ne gambhir tippanee kii he ou kaha he ki 29 agast 2018 ko supreme court ne maharashtra sarkaar or anya ko notice jari kiya
 Within hours of the verdict, Joint Commissioner Shivarirao Bhodke held a press conference in Pune, claiming that the Pune police had enough evidence
 jabaki court ne in paanch logon ke transit par roak laga di thi

 It was alleged that the arrested people wanted to attack the Prime Minister

 However, these letters were not placed before the court

 New Delhi: Avinash Mishra is the typical youth signature of modern Hindi poetry
 prem ke maah farvari main raajakmal prakaashan ne unke kavy sangrah 'chaunsath sutara solah abhimaan' kaa locarpan oxford bukstor main kiya gaya
 This book is the third work of author Avinash Mishra
 chaunsath sutara solah abhimaan 'kamasutra' se prerit kavy sangrah he
 This poetic collection of Avinash Mishra in this love filled month of spring not only describes the various arts of love, but also presents a modern interpretation of Vatsayan's Kamasutra
 is sangrah main shaamil kavitaayen ek lambii kavita ke do khandon ke alag-alag charnon ke rup main prastut kii gai hai
 The poet falls in love and brings with him the Kamasutra
 vatsyayan krit kamasutra
 These poems are born by this coincidence
 kavi prem or kaamrat premi bhi rahata he or drushtaakavi bhi
 The classical style of Vatsyayana probably makes it easier for him to find his pause, and commas, to stay there and to be able to see himself, his beloved, and his love, where these poems come and take place
 yah style na hoti to vah prem main doobane, usamen rahane, use jeene-bhogane kii prakriya ko shaayad is sanlagnta or is tatasthta se ek saath nahin dekh paata
 On the occasion of the inauguration, 14 immortal Hindi poems selected by the author were also recited by Amarendra Nath Tripathi, Ankita Anand, Suman Parmar, Prabhat Ranjan, r Anuradha, Neha Rai, Vartika and Kuldeep Mishra
 jin kavitaaon kaa paath hua, ve thim, 'saharsha sweekaara he', 'aarer daal', 'or jivan biit gaya', 'aao jal bhare jivan main jhanken', 'agar maine kisi ke hont ke patal kabhi chume', 'raat aadhi khinch kar tumhaari hatheli', 'prem', 'pehla chumban', 'dhoop kii bhashaa', 'tum ain', 'sindur tilakit bhaal' , 'tram main ek yaad', 'been bhi hoon main tumhaari raagini bhi hoon' evam 'ukti'
 Poet Avinash Mishra, who wants to settle in the impossible, has a total of 80 poems in the poetry collection 'chausath Sutra Sixteen Abhimaan'
 laghu prem kathaon ke daur main 'kamasutra' se prerit yah prem kii laghu kavitaayen hai
 Small in size, but complete in its construction and coverage
 lekhak avinaash mishra ne sawaalon kaa jawaab dete hue kaha, 'main lambii kavitaaon kaa virdohi hota ja rahaa rahaa hum
 i believe poems should be as brief as possible
 yahi meri kavy sadhana kaa pramukh ang he
 i pay more attention to how to say my words in less words

 raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne kaha he ki bharat-pakistan sarhad par tanaav kaa silsilaa tham jayega
 Taking part in the 'hai Ready Hum' session in the Agenda Aaj Tak, Parrikar spoke on the preparedness of the army
 is sawaal par ki desh yuddh kii disha main ja rahaa he yaa shanti kii ore, raksha mantri ne kaha ki shanti sabase acchhee cheez hoti he
 But if you want to build peace, you have to increase strength and show strength
 shanti kii dagar main chalane kaa hamaara itihaas rahaa he
 But those who compromise with fear of war are called cowards
 pehle hamalaa nahin karne kii niti par parrikar ne kaha ki bharat aakraamak ravaiya nahin akhriyaar nahin karata
 One should decide according to the circumstances
 yuddh jaisi sthiti hogi to thodi bahut haani hogi
 Martyrdom is not good
 hamen bhi acha nahin lagata ki yuddh ho
 When the tension increases, we also lose our young
 lekin raksha mantri ke taur par hamaari jimmedaari he ki ham apane nagarikon kii raksha karen
 On the question of surgical strike, Parrikar said that it is the job of the army to cross the border, the government does not
 lekin is bare main faisla political leadership ko karnaa hota he
 He said, 'if the surgical strike was successful, all started burning
 unhen lagane laga ki iskaa credit sarkaar legi
 If we had failed, then the accountability would have come on us
 hamaari aalochana hoti
 If the Modi government is responsible for taking the decision, then success credit should also be given
 hamane sena ko free hand de diya
 This had not happened before
 parrikar ne kaha ki modi sarkaar sena ko lekar raajnneeti nahin kar rahi balki bengal kii mukhyamantri kar rahi hai
 He said, 'I said in Parliament that the army should not be dragged into politics
 'unhone aage kaha, 'main aresas se judaa rahaa hum, bijepi kaa aadmi hum, iaiti kaa student rahaa hum
 Because of all these backgrounds i am able to take a decision
 isse sargical strike par faisle kaa isse koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 When i give a speech in Goa, i do not mention the Central Government or the surgical strike
 pakistan kaa bhi naam nahin letaa
 My sense of humor is fine
 lekin yah kai baar vivaad paidaa kar detaa he
 On the matter of defense procurement, Parrikar said that these have been going on as they have been for 12 years
 ab ham is prakriya main sudhaar kar rahe hai
 The beginning of any project takes 2 to two and a half years
 unhone kaha ki mek in india se duusari industry main koi dikkat nahin he lekin dephence kaa maamla alag he
 More than 50 foreign companies have shown interest in Make in India
 emoyu par dastakhat hue hai
 On comparing the Indian Army to the Israeli and Lebanese forces, the Defense Minister said that 100% success is not possible in any operation
 mujhe apni army par garv he
 Be it 1965 or 1971 or 1999, our army fought with all its might

 ) shivasena or bijepi gathbandhan main ek baar phir daraar aa gai he
 The reason this time is the West Coast Oil Refinery Project to be set up in Ratnagiri, Maharashtra
 bhale hi donon partiyon ke netaa is maamle main ek duusare par aarope-pratyarope kar rahe hon, lekin iske raajnneetik myne kuch or hi hai
 Let's know the politics behind this whole controversy
 
 
 shivasena desh kii sabase badi kahe jane vaale west coast oil rifynary project ke khilaaf pradarshan kar rahi he
 In this regard, Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray said that we will not allow the refinery project to be put up in Konkan, as it will harm the environment
 yahi nahin, project nanar gaanv ke logon ke khilaaf he
 If this project takes place, outsiders will buy the land of the people of the village
 thakare is project ko lekar pradhanmantri narendra modi or mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ko saaf shabdon main yah chetavanee de chuke hai ki wo is project ke khilaaf he or yadi ise sarkaar lagaana chaahati he to vidarbha yaa phir gujarat main lagaae
 How is the project
 
 
 ab project kii baat kii jaae to is rifynary kii prastaavit kshamta 60 million ton prati varsh hogi
 That means 70 percent more than India's largest refinery in Jamnagar at present
 philhal jamnagar rifynary kii kshamta 35 million ton he
 The project cost three lakh crores
 
 
 is project kii laagat teen lakh karod rupee he
 If this project is completed, it will provide employment to one lakh people
 rifynary ko philhal teen public sector pramot karenge
 These are Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL), Bharat Petroleum (BPCL) and Indian Oil (IOC)
 in teenon main sabase bada partner he indian oil
 It has a 50% stake in the project
 vahiin, hindustan petroleum or bharat petroleum kii hissedari 25 % he
 On April 11, 2018, an mou was signed between the three psus and Saudi Aramco to build the refinery and petrochemicals complex
 iske baad 2015 main centre sarkaar ne project lagane ke liye maharashtra ko chunaa
 What does the BJP have to say on Shiv Sena's allegations? BJP says that the environmental damage caused by this project is completely wrong
 yah ek green project he or isamen advance technology kaa istemaal hoga, jo paryaavaran ko nuksaan nahin pahunchayegaa
 The BJP also raised the question that the Shiv Sena never protested when nuclear projects were set up in Maharashtra
 phir ab is project par kyon adanga laga rahe hai
 Although, BJP leaders have tried to convince the Shiv Sena on several fronts to pass this project, but the Shiv Sena is still not ready
 to aakhir kya he iske peeche raajnneeti?bijepi adhyaksh amit shahne 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav main shivasena ke saath dobaaraa chunaav ladane kii baat kahi thi, lekin shivasena netaaon ne is mudde se kinaaraa kar liya
 However, there were many disputes between the two parties, but so far both are in alliance
 lekin konkan ko lekar raajnneeti kuch or hi he
 Actually, Shiv Sena has a good hold in Konkan
 jabaki yahaan bijepi lambey samay se pair pasaarne kii koshish kar rahi he
 Which Shiv Sena does not like at all
 isliye bijepi ne rifynary project ke jariye logon ke bich utarana chaha, lekin shivasena ne virodh kar diya
 Now it will be seen in the coming times how far Shiv Sena and BJP go on this issue
 vahiin, shivasena ke saamne narayan rane bhi nai chunauti he, jo haal hi main apni nai party maharashtra swabhimaan party ke saath konkan main pair jamaa rahe hai
 What is the state of Konkan? There are three districts in Konkan, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Raigad
 yahaan loksabhaa kii do or vidhansabha kii 12 siten hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha, Shiv Sena won both seats from here
 jabaki vidhansabha chunaav main 6 siten shivasena, teen ensipi, ek congress or 2 siten PWP ko mili thim

 yani priyanka gandhi or narendra modi ek baar phir sidhi takkar hone ja rahi he
 To face a speaker like Narendra Modi, the Congress needs this language as well as sentiment
 kyonki uttar pradesh kii 80 siton main se do siton ko lekar santusht baith janaa uski raajnneeti ko samet degaa
 After all, why Purvanchal? Rahul Gandhi has given the responsibility of Purvanchal to his sister, this is a very effective area according to the Lok Sabha elections

 Dhanwantari Dev is worshiped on Dhanteras
 inako ayurveda kaa acharya bhi kaha jaataa he
 They are the doctors of the gods
 dev dhanvantari ko lakshmi kaa bhai bhi mana jaataa he
 The tradition of buying utensils on the day of Dhanteras is associated with their incarnation
 jab samudr manthan ho rahaa tha tab sagar kii atal gaharaaiyon se chaudaa ratna nikle the
 Dhanvantari is one of these gems
 jab devtaa or daanav mandaar parvat ko mathni banaakar vasuki naag kii madad se samudr kaa manthan kar rahe the, tab 13 ratnon ke baad karthik krishna paksh kii trayodashi ko 14wein ratna ke rup main dhanvantari saamne aae
 He had appeared with Amrit Kalash
 dhanvantari ke prakat hote hi devataaon or daanvon kaa jhagada shuru ho gaya
 Clashes broke out between the gods and demons for the Amrit Kalash
 lekin bhagwaan vishnu ne mohini rup dharkar amrit kalash hasil kar liya
 Why is Dhanvantari worshiped? Dhanvantari appeared with the blessing of nectar
 ayurveda ke jaankaar bhi the, isliye unhen aarogy kaa devtaa mana jaataa he
 Although Goddess Lakshmi is the goddess of wealth and wealth, but to get her grace, she needs health and longevity
 yahi vajah he ki dhanteras ke maukey par dhanvantari kii puja kii jaati he
 Why do you buy utensils on Dhanteras? Kartik appeared on Lord Krishna Dhanvantari's Kalash on the third day of Krishna Paksha, so it is a tradition to buy utensils on this date
 mana jaataa he ki dhanteras ke din aap jitani kharidari karte hai, usamen 13 guna vruddhi hoti he
 Why buy silver on Dhanteras? Actually silver is considered a symbol of the moon which provides coolness
 yah swasthyakaarak bhi mana gaya he jo nirogi kaaya or tej dimag detaa he
 Due to the influence of the Moon, the wealth of contentment resides in the mind and it has been called the greatest wealth
 jiske paas santosh or swasthya he, usee ko sabase dhanwaan mana jaataa he
