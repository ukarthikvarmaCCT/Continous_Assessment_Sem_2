 ) kattar hindutv kii chhavi vaali kendriya mantri sadhvi niranjan jyoti ne somvaar ko kanpur main 'aaj tak' kii panchayat main ram mandir ko lekar ek nai baat kah di
 Contrary to his image, he said that the Ram temple issue cannot be allowed to stall in the way of development
 ram mandir aasthaa kaa sawalsadhvi jyoti ne kaha kiraam mandirastha kaa sawaal he
 To build a temple, one has to either decide unanimously or wait for the court's decision
 jab unase poocha gaya ki kya har baar apane ghoshnaptr main ram mandir kii baat karne vaali bijepi ab is mudde ko vikaas kii raah main roda maanati he, to unhone itnaa bhar kaha ki mandir kaa maamla adaalat main he or faisle kaa intjaar karnaa hi hoga
 Expressing regret over Ramzade's statement, the image of Niranjan Jyoti is that of a staunch Hindu leader who is often in the limelight due to his controversial statements
 ramjade ko lekar unka bayaan behad surkhiyon main rahaa tha
 Due to this, the BJP had to face a lot of trouble
 lekin 'aaj tak' ke is kaarykram main jab unase isvivadaaspad bayaanke bare main poocha gaya to unhone bina laag lapet kaha ki unka yah bayaan galat tha or unhen aisi bhashaa ke istemaal karne kaa afsos he
 Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti's statement about Ram temple on the occasion of elections in UP is a clear indication that BJP does not want to heat up the issue at the moment
 saath hi use nahin lagata ki is vakt ram mandir ke mudde par vot batore ja sakate hai
 The issue of Ram temple in UP came into the limelight recently when SPPM Mulayam Singh Yadav said in a program that he had fired on kar sevaks in Ayodhya to protect secularism
 niranjan jyoti ne kaha ki musalamaanon kaa vot batorne ke liye mulaayam singh yadav aise bayaan de rahe hai

 You may not know Satyabrata Mitra
 hamaare aapke bich se koi bhi satyabrat mitra ho saktaa he
 To be Satyabrata Mitra means to dream of buying a house
 har din koi na koi sampark karne kaa prayaas karata he ki falaan builder teen chaar saal se flats nahin de rahaa he
 When we tell one of our correspondents, it makes us sad that we are not getting the flat for four years
 is chakra main sab fanse hai
 This is not the first time the media has raised this issue loudly
 akhbaar se lekar tamaam channel samay samay par is masale ko uthaate rahe hai, magar kisi ko raahat nahin he
 In 2010, Satyabrata Mitra booked a house in Earth Earth's Project Earth Town in Greater Noida West
 satyabrat kaa daawa he ki builder ne broshar main daawa kiya tha ki 15 agast 2012 tak flats mil jayega
 2016 has arrived, but the flat has not been found
 is flats ko hasil karne kii ladaai ne satyabrat kii zindagi badal di he
 Satyabrata Mitra's battle started when he did not get the agreement from the builder even after giving 10 percent money
 unhenko harkar 40 pratishat paise dene pade, tab jaakar may 2011 man agreement kii copy mili
 When i saw the copy of the agreement, i was surprised to see many changes
 broshar or agreement ke bich kaaphi antar aa chukaa tha
 The builder increased the super area to 100 square feet, due to which he had to pay Rs 2 lakh more
 yahi nahin 2012 main ghar dene kii taarikh bhi badal gai
 It was written in the agreement that after 36 months of the agreement, the house will be found
 yani 2012 kii jagah 2014 main milegaa
 But in the meantime, the farmers reached the court for their compensation and the work stopped
 yahi nahin builder ne pehle vaada kiya tha ki ground floor ke alaava 14 manzil imaarat banegi, 29 tower banenge, lekin agreement main likhaa tha ki ground floor plus 19 manzil kaa tower banegaa
 Satyabrata and with him kept on writing letters with all kinds of authority but to no avail
 phir elahabaad hai court gaye
 Date is being received from there, hearing is going on but flat has not been found
 iske baad kuch kharidaaron ne milakar rit yachika daayar kar di
 The writ stated that buyers should be compensated
 court ne greater noida athurity ko aadesh diya ki karidaaron or bilderon ko bulaakar samaadhaan nikaale
 It has been a month for this order, the builder and buyer have not met yet
 in logon ne upi ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke saamne bhi baat rakhi he
 An FIR has also been filed against the builder's director
 ek-ek baat isliye gina rahaa hum, taaki aap yah samaj saken ki flats nahin milane par aapse se kai log kis tarah pareshaan hote hai, to kahaan kahaan jate hai, kis kis se milte hai, magar hota kuch nahin he
 Finally let's understand that let's go to the media
 vahaan bhi jate hai, khabaren chalati hai, magar hota kuch nahin hai
 Leaders feel that there are all the issues to make you emotional, then all these problems should be left to fight alone
 vaise aapkaa bhavuk muddon se kaam chal bhi jaataa he
 For the last four to five years, ten to fifty, fifty to hundred buyers have been performing together in different cities across the country
 un pradarshnon ko fasebuk par aplod karte hai
 Put on Twitter, so that the patriotic people present there will create a ruckus on this injustice done to the rest of the patriots, but nothing happens
 zaruri he ki aap aam logon ke banaae in sanghathanon ke naam se bhi rubaru ho len
 Under FEDRATIONS OF APARTMENT OWNERS ASSOCIATION, 88 housing society people are connected
 NEFOWA- NEW ERA FLAT OWENRS WELFARE ASSOCIATION ke pej se pataa chalata he ki 9672 sadsy hai
 NEFOMA- NOIDA ESTATE FLAT OWNER MAIN ASSOCIATION has 10,206 members on Facebook
 KOLKATA WEST INTERNATIONAL CITY BUYERS WELFARE ASSOCIATION ke pej par 4087 likes hai
 TRIVENI FARIDABAD ALLOTTIES ASSOCIATION has 2700 members, out of which 300 are BSF personnel
 iske alaava, AMRAPALI VERONA HEIGHTS FLAT BUYERS ASSOCIATION,EARTH TOWN BUYERS, PARAMOUNT APARTMENT OWNER ASSOCIATIONS jaise kai sanghathan hai
 i mentioned the name, so that you can know how many organizations have formed in this country of all the organizations troubled by the builders
 ve apane apane str par ek lambii ladaai lard rahe hai
 Whenever he comes to Delhi to meet Rahul Gandhi, he goes to Lucknow to meet Akhilesh Yadav
 kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu ke saamne bhi jaakar rote hai
 But nothing happens
 yahi nahin vidhayak se lekar saansadon tak kaa darvaja khatkhataate hai
 Defeated from everywhere, there are also various performances at the builder's door
 aap inaki pareshaaniyon se ban rahe ek alag kism ke naagarik andolan kii tasviir bhi dekhiye taaki andaaza ho or aap satark bhi ho saken ki kahin aapako bhi is tarah se pradarshan na karnaa pad jaae
 We have taken some pictures from their Facebook page
 in logon ne to apane kapade tak utaar diye taaki sabakaa dhyaan ja sake
 In this picture, people are tied on the mouth
 aap is tasviir main lambii si raily dekh sakate hai
 Here people have sat on the road itself
 kahin anna kii topi dikhaai dene lagati he, maano ye topi dekhte hi builder kisi bhavi kejariwal se dar kar flats de den to kahin koi gandhi hi ban gaya he
 This trust in Gandhi is wonderful
 kisi ko shodh karnaa chahie ki bharat main ek saal main kitne pradarshnon main gandhi kaa aahwan kiya jaataa he
 Will Gandhi's soul really be able to change the things that trouble people
 nae nae kism ke slogan nikal rahe hai
 Amrapali took so long that Dada should book the house and grandson get possession
 ek slogan he roti kapadaa or lise
 
 
 Pictures of all these demonstrations from local to national media in Delhi are printed within page number one to ten
 ye log cliping bana lete hai or ghoomte rahete hai
 We all focus on the spokespersons of the two political parties, but a sociologist should go and see how the problems in the flat have made the middle class active
 wo tamaam tarah kii sansthaaon se takaraa rahaa he
 Getting desperate and changing in the process itself
 hamaare sahyogi mihir ne fasebuk se kuch aisi or tasviren nikaalin jin par aapkaa dhyaan janaa zaruri he
 Buyers upset with builders keep visiting the site
 apane sapanom ko dekhte rahete hai ki kab ye hasil hoga
 when making
 is chakkar main ve siaidi kaa bhi kaam karne lagate hai
 Going from place to place, they start taking pictures and hide where work is going on
 kahaan maal padaa hua he yaa kahaan kaam band ho gaya he
 All these pictures are then uploaded on the same social media, where we have agreed that if the awareness remains somewhere, then it is social media
 fasebuk in logon kii pareshaaniyon kaa nayaa mandir he, jiske darvaaze ye tamaam tarah kii tasviren chadha aate hai
 Perhaps in the hope that social media Mai will one day look at them and get a flat
 hamaare sahyogi mihir gautam ne ek or baat bataai
 Mihir also suffers flat
 is kram main unka anubhav bhi lagaataar badalata ja rahaa he
 He said that by 2010, people used to sneak into a builder's office and talk freely
 suna bhi dete the
 But for the last one or two years it has also stopped
 zyaadaatar jagahon par bilderon ne bounsar tainaat kar die hai, jinke kaaran ab ye kisi se nahin mil sakate
 The builder can meet whoever he wants
 tippaniyan a report by Saurabh Sinha was found in Times of India dated 12 March 2015

 hamaare sahyogi raveesh ranjan shukla faridabad gaye
 The buyers of the flat have met the spirits there
 inaki koi sun nahin rahaa
 You are requested by the audience that if you see and hear them, they will have confidence in the media that a problem will be solved by showing them

 satyabrat mitra ne saal 2010 main greater noida west main arth infrastracchar ke project arth toun main ghar book karaayaa tha
 Satyabrata claims that the builder had claimed in the brochure that the flat would be found by 15 August 2012
 2016 aa gaya he, magar flats nahin mila he
 The battle to acquire this flat changed the life of Satyabrata
 10 pratishat paisa dene ke baad bhi builder se agreement nahin mila to satyabrat mitra kii ladaai shuru ho gai
 He had to give 40 percent money after losing, then he got a copy of the agreement in May 2011
 agreement kii copy dekhi to kai badlaavon ko dekh hairaan rah gaye
 There was a lot of difference between the brochure and the agreement
 builder ne 100 varg foot kaa super aria badha diya, jiske kaaran unako 2 lakh rupee or dene pade
 Not only this, the date of giving home in 2012 also changed
 agreement main likhaa hua tha ki agreement banane ke 36 maheene ke baad ghar milegaa
 That is, you will get 2014 instead of 2012
 lekin is bich kisaan apane muaavze ko lekar court pahunch gaye or kaam band ho gaya
 Not only this, the builder had earlier promised that in addition to the ground floor, 14 floors would be built, 29 towers would be built, but in the agreement it was written that the ground floor plus 19 floor towers would be built
 satyabrat or unke saath tamaam tarah kii athurity se chitthee patari karte rah gaye magar koi laabh nahin hua
 Then went to Allahabad High Court
 vahaan se tarikh hi mil rahi he, sunwaayee hi ho rahi he magar flats nahin mila he
 After this, some buyers filed a writ petition together
 rit main kaha ki karidaaron ko muawza milanaa chahie
 The court ordered the Greater Noida Authority to call buyers and builders to find a solution
 ek maheenaa ho gaya he is aadesh kaa, abhi tak builder or karidaar kii baithak nahin hui he
 These people have also spoken in front of UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 builder ke diarector ke khilaaf exiaar bhi darj ho chuki he
 i am counting every single thing, so that you can understand how many people are upset with you if you do not get a flat, then where do they go, whom do they meet, but nothing happens
 ant main yah samajhate hai ki chalo media ke paas
 Go there too, the news goes on, but nothing happens

 The comments 12 march 2015 kii times of india main saurabh sinha kii ek report mili
 According to this, the essence of this world is that if you have dreamed of buying a flat, then you will not be able to see any other dream
 saurabh kii report ke anusaar, riyality analist prope equity ke mutabik ghaziabad or noida main flats milane main ausat deree 29-30 maheene kii he
 That is, we have to face a minimum delay of two years
 gudgaanv main yah deree 34 maheene kii he or faridabad main 44 maheene kii
 Saurabh has written that as of 2015 Noida Extension, Noida Yamuna Expressway and Greater Noida 3
 6 lakh flats die jane the
 Of these, 3 lakh 20 thousand units flats i
e
 88
 7 fisadi deree se chal rahe hai
 Three lakh units were launched between 2006 and 11, some of them not built, some not started and some are being built
 report pichley saal kii he, magar halaat main buhat badlaav nahin hua he
 Our colleague Ravish Ranjan Shukla went to Faridabad
 vahaan flats ke karidaar atmaaon se mulaakaat kii he
 Nobody is listening to them
 aap darshakon se guzarish he ki aap dekh sun lenge to inkaa media par bharosa bana rahegaa ki samasya dikhaane se samaadhaan ho jayega
 i remain a bit apprehensive about this type of trust towards the media, but should think positively
 kya pataa aapke dekhne yaa jaagruk hone se halaat badal jaae
 Satyabrata Mitra's battle started when he did not get the agreement from the builder even after giving 10 percent money
 unhenko harkar 40 pratishat paise dene pade, tab jaakar may 2011 man agreement kii copy mili
 When i saw the copy of the agreement, i was surprised to see many changes
 broshar or agreement ke bich kaaphi antar aa chukaa tha
 The builder increased the super area to 100 square feet, due to which he had to pay Rs 2 lakh more
 yahi nahin 2012 main ghar dene kii taarikh bhi badal gai
 It was written in the agreement that after 36 months of the agreement, the house will be found
 yani 2012 kii jagah 2014 main milegaa
 But in the meantime, the farmers reached the court for their compensation and the work stopped
 yahi nahin builder ne pehle vaada kiya tha ki ground floor ke alaava 14 manzil imaarat banegi, 29 tower banenge, lekin agreement main likhaa tha ki ground floor plus 19 manzil kaa tower banegaa
 Satyabrata and with him kept on writing letters with all kinds of authority but to no avail
 phir elahabaad hai court gaye
 Date is being received from there, hearing is going on but flat has not been found
 iske baad kuch kharidaaron ne milakar rit yachika daayar kar di
 The writ stated that buyers should be compensated
 court ne greater noida athurity ko aadesh diya ki karidaaron or bilderon ko bulaakar samaadhaan nikaale
 It has been a month for this order, the builder and buyer have not met yet
 in logon ne upi ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke saamne bhi baat rakhi he
 An FIR has also been filed against the builder's director
 ek-ek baat isliye gina rahaa hum, taaki aap yah samaj saken ki flats nahin milane par aapse se kai log kis tarah pareshaan hote hai, to kahaan kahaan jate hai, kis kis se milte hai, magar hota kuch nahin he
 Finally let's understand that let's go to the media
 vahaan bhi jate hai, khabaren chalati hai, magar hota kuch nahin hai
 Leaders feel that there are all the issues to make you emotional, then all these problems should be left to fight alone
 vaise aapkaa bhavuk muddon se kaam chal bhi jaataa he
 For the last four to five years, ten to fifty, fifty to hundred buyers have been performing together in different cities across the country

 Will Gandhi's soul really be able to change the things that trouble people

 Getting desperate and changing in the process itself
 hamaare sahyogi mihir ne fasebuk se kuch aisi or tasviren nikaalin jin par aapkaa dhyaan janaa zaruri he
 Buyers upset with builders keep visiting the site
 apane sapanom ko dekhte rahete hai ki kab ye hasil hoga

 Going from place to place, they start taking pictures and hide where work is going on
 kahaan maal padaa hua he yaa kahaan kaam band ho gaya he
 All these pictures are then uploaded on the same social media, where we have agreed that if the awareness remains somewhere, then it is social media
 fasebuk in logon kii pareshaaniyon kaa nayaa mandir he, jiske darvaaze ye tamaam tarah kii tasviren chadha aate hai
 Perhaps in the hope that social media Mai will one day look at them and get a flat

 The builder can meet whoever he wants

 Stacked for 248 runs in 5 overs
 pakistan kii ore se mohammad amer, naved ul hasan, shahid afridi or said ajmal ne 2-2 wicket chatkaye
 Dravid's innings did not work, India's 'wall' Rahul Dravid played a hard-hitting 76 off 103 balls in difficult times, but he too could not save India from defeat in the opening match and because of the fiasco with Harbhajan Singh
 Run out
 master ballebaaj sachin tendulkar (8) pavilion lautne vaale pehle khilaadi rahe
 Gautam Gambhir (57 runs) was in excellent form, but was run out in the run-off affair
 yah salaami ballebaaj apni is galati se kaaphi niraash tha
 Gambhir faced 7 balls and hit 7 fours and 2 high sixes
 gambhir or dravid ne duusare wicket ke liye 67 ran kii bhagidaari kii
 Raina's patient performance: Suresh Raina also performed brilliantly
 unhone 41 gend kaa saamana karte hue 5 chauke or 2 chakke kii madad se 46 ran jode or bhartiya kheme main ummid jagaayi, lekin vah 35wein over main ajmal kii yarker gend par pagabaadha out hue
 In difficult times, Raina and Dravid shared a 72-run 67-ball partnership for the fifth wicket for India
 tendulkar chauthe over kii pehali gend main amer ko wicket de baithe
 This Pakistani bowler took wickets and looked up at the sky and shouted happily
 tendulkar ne baahar jaati gend ko push karne kii koshish kii, lekin gend balle se chooti hui wicketiper ke haathon main chali gayi
 At this time India's score was one wicket for 23 runs
 iske baad umr gul kii gend par mid aaf par younis khan ne gend uthaakar diarect hit se gambhir ke stump ukhaad diye
 Kohli came to an easy catch Virat Kohli also kept on scoring 16 runs
 unhone shahid afridi kii gend ko unchaa uthaa diya, lekin long aaf main khadey umr gul ne ise lapak liya or gend unke haathon se girane vaali thi lekin unhone teesri baar main ise sambhaal kar bhartiya ballebaaj ko pavilion pahunchaaya
 Dhoni could not do it, even Mahendra Singh Dhoni could not stay at the crease for much longer
 afridi ne do gend pehle bhi pagabaadha kii apil kii thi, lekin dhoni tab batch gayi the, lekin vah 23
 Lbw in 5 overs
 lagaataar do wicket girane se pakistan ne match par shikanja kas liya tha
 Before the better partnership, Malik faced 126 balls and hit 16 fours in his innings
 pakistan ne 15wein over tak teen wicket ganvaa diye the, lekin malik or yusuf ne chauthe wicket ke liye 188 gend main 206 ran kii bhagidaari nibhaai
 Apart from Ashish Nehra (four wickets for 55 runs), no Indian bowler failed to stop Pakistan, taking the wickets of Imran Nazir, Kamran Akmal, Yusuf and Umar Akmal
 harbhajan (71 ran par ek wicket) bhi super sport park kii dhimi pich par koi dhamal nahin kar paye
 Pakistan recovered from the setback, Ishant Sharma took two wickets in the end for 39 runs while RP Singh and Yusuf Pathan took one wicket each
 pakistan ne 25wein over ke ant main teen wicket ke nuksaan par 108 ran bana liye the or usne ubarte hue 40wein over tak score teen wicket par 217 ran kar diya
 Pakistan's score was 139 for three in 31 overs and they more than doubled it in the last 19 overs, which also proved the theory of slowing the score in the middle overs in a one-day international
 malik kaa shandaar pradarshnamlik ne 81 gend main apana ardhashatak puraa kiya or phir iske baad aakraamak pradarshan karte hue 108 gendon kaa saamana kiya
 He was dismissed in the 49th over
 captain younis (20), shahid afridi (04) or umr akmal (shunya) haalanki kuch yogadan nahin de sake
 Pakistan started aggressively
 imran nazeer or kamran akmal donon ne chauke se shuruuaat kii, jiskaa khamiyaja aar pi singh ko bhugatna padaa jinke pehle do overon main 21 ran bane
 Nehra took the wickets of these two
 nazeer (20) deep main kaich out hue jabaki baahar jaati gend ne akmal (19) ke stump ukhaad diye
 Pakistan's good run slowed Pakistan's good start
 gend kii chamak khone or wicket ke dhimaa hone se nauven or 13wein over main ran gati kaaphi kam ho gayi
 Younis Khan tried to drive in this disappointment and after touching the ball with the bat, caught the wicketkeeper
 pakistan ke donon madhyakram ballebaajon ne pari sanbhali
 The bowling of Virat Kohli and Yusuf Pathan also failed to bring India any success, after which Harbhajan Singh went to bowling in the 25th over, which helped both these Pakistani batsmen score superb innings and lead the team to this score

 According to Vastu Shastra, there is also a plant that not only enhances the beauty of your home but can also improve your financial condition
 ji haa or is paudhe kaa naam he 'mani plant'
 It is often said about this plant that this plant should never be bought and planted at home
 aaie jaanate hai aakhir kaise kuch upaay karke aap is paudhe kii madad se apana ruthaa bhagya chamakaa sakate hai
 -first measure, money plant should always be kept in South East Zone
 hindu dharm ke anusaar south east jone bhagwaan ganpati kaa hota he
 Money plant plant is considered a symbol of money, good fortune
 ghar ke is kone main ise rakhane se vyakti kii kismat khul jaati he
 - Bring the mani plant to the house on the day of Revathi Nakshatra on Wednesday
 aisa isliye kyonki yah din bhi vyakti ko shubh fal dene vaale ganpati kaa mana jaataa hai
 Don't forget to keep the money plant plant in the North East Zone
 aisa karne se aapke swasth par nakaaratmak asar padegaa or ghar ke sadsy biimaar ho sakate hai
 -if the relationship has deteriorated with the partner, first remove the money plant from the west or east zone of your house
 ghaki ke is kone main rakhaa mani plant aapako maansik pareshaani dene ke saath rishte main khatas laata he
 In such a situation, to bring sweetness in the relationship with the people of the house, you should put a money plant with heart shape leaves in the house
 -paison kii killat dur karne ke liye aapako note kii shape vaala mani plant south east disha main lagaana chahie
 Apart from this, one should never give water to this plant on Sunday and always add a spoon of milk to the water while giving water
 aisa karne se ghar main sukh aane ke saath paison kii kami bhi dur hogi
 If the money plant in the house is spreading towards the land, do not let this happen
 iskaa matlab aapkaa dhan fijul chizon main kharch ho rahaa he
 To store money and bring peace to the house, tie the money plant upside down with the help of a rope or pole
 aisa karne se aapke yash or paison main bhi badhottaree hogi

 ajit singh kaa is seat se chunaav ladane ke faisle ko party kii doorgaami ranneeti se bhi jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 National Secretary General of RLD Drs
 merajuddin ne kaha ki choudhary ajit singh mujffarnagar se chunaav maidan main utarkar jat or muslim ko phir se ekajute karnaa chaahate hai
 Actually the RLD has been winning the electoral battle for a long time by equating Jat and Muslim votes
 isiilie areldi sapa-basapa ke saath milakar apana khoyaa hua janaadhar paane ke prayaas main he
 The RLD suffered heavy losses in the last Lok Sabha and 2017 assembly elections
 haalanki mujffarnagar main choudhary ajit singh dalit, muslim or jaaton ko ekajute karne main safal rahete hai to bijepi ke liye jeet doharaana tedi kheer ho jayega
 If we look at the ethnic equation of Muzaffarnagar, there are maximum five and a half lakh Muslim voters
 iske baad teen lakh jat or teen lakh hi dalit matadaata hai
 Apart from this, there are one lakh Saini, one lakh Rajput and two and a half million Kashyap votes
 dalit, muslim or jat ko agar jod dete hai to kareeb 70 fisadi ke kareeb hota he, lekin choudhary ajit singh kii tarah hi bijepi ke sanjeev baalion bhi jat samudaay se aate hai
 In this way, both leaders are engaged in helping Jat voters
 jabaki, bijepi jaaton ke saath-saath gaiyr yadav obisi maton ko bhi apane paale main laane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Jairam says that to divert attention from Raghuram, the central government has announced foreign investment decisions
 bharat ke sankhya main chote magar sabase bade vipakshi dal kii taraf se yahi aalochana ai he or jairam ramesh ne kaha he ki somvaar ko vistrut pratikriya aegi
 When India's main opposition party cannot present criticism on the day of the decision, then tell that if the government of the fourth largest economy of the world takes the decision of foreign investment in several sectors simultaneously, then within eight hours, the news anchor should present a sufficient review of those decisions Can
 vipaksh aaj ke din puch saktaa tha ki koi aisa sector bachaa hua he jo videshi nivesh ke liye nahin khulaa
 The Press Information Bureau, released in English by the Press Information Bureau, said that the central government has fully liberalized foreign direct investment to generate employment in India
 sarkaar kii taraf se kaha gaya he ki in badlaavon ke saath bharat duniya kii sabase khuli arthvyavastha ho gaya he
 With this, 100% FDI will be allowed in the defense sector, till now 49% FDI was allowed directly
 usase upar 100% tak FDI ke liye sarkaar kii ijazat zaruri thi or wo bhi sirf unnat takanic ke maamle main hi aise nivesh kii ijazat mil sakati thi
 Now, the term State of Art has been removed and the word Technique has been replaced and the words Modern ie Modern or Other reasons have been added
 unnat takanic or aadhunik takanic main kya antar hota he
 Is modern technology not advanced, or is advanced technology not modern? purv raksha mantri eke antni ne in faislon ko rashtriya suraksha ke liye khatra bataaya he
 By the way, such decisions have also been made during his time
 raksha sameekshak ajay shukla ne twarit pratikriya pesh karte hue likhaa he ki raksha main sau fisadi kaa nivesh shabdon kaa khel he
 Permission was given on the basis of State of Art Tech since the time of UPA
 ab jaakar ise aadhunik technology ke root se anumati di gai he
 Ajay Shukla says that the Ministry of Defense has no definition of modern or state of the art technology
 lihaaza is antar raksha kshetra main videshi nivesh sudhaar ke taur par pesh karne kii zarurat hi kya he
 Ajay Shukla wrote in Business Standard newspaper on June 9, 2014 that since 2006, 100 percent foreign investment in the defense sector has been allowed in different cases
 tab unhone kaha tha ki moulik upkaran nirmaataaon ke liye yah sab 2006 se kiya ja rahaa he lekin ek bhi project nahin aayaa
 i have given an alternative opinion but it is important that opinion should be formed only after concrete information on every sector
 baharhaal centre sarkaar ne aaj 9 kshetron main videshi nivesh kii maatra badhaane kaa faisla kiya he
 The Prime Minister has called it the second major reform after November 2015
 baharhaal khaane pine kii saamagree ke nirmaan main sarkaar kii anumati se 100 fisadi kaa videshi nivesh hone lagegaa
 100 per cent has also been allowed in e-commerce of food produced and manufactured in India
 broadcasting jaise dit, cabel network, mobile tivi ke kshetra main 100 fisadi videshi nivesh ko sarkari prakriyaaon se mukt kar diya gaya he
 The central government says that in the 2015 fiscal year, foreign investment has been more than $ 55 billion
 yah kisi bhi ek vittiya varsh main record he
 The Government of India has said that such a big decision was taken on Monday to increase employment
 ham yah bataane kii sthiti main nahin hai ki 2014 se 2016 tak jo record videshi nivesh aayaa he usase kitna rojgaar srijan hua he yaa hone ja rahaa he
 On the First Post website, Sindhu Bhattacharya wrote an article on 15 April 2016 that in the two years of the Modi government, employment in eight sectors has slowed down
 ye soochna bharat sarkaar ke shram beuro kii report par aadhaarit he
 The textile industry, leather industry, metal industry, automobiles, gems and gems, transport and IT and BPO, handloom powerloom, these eight sectors require a lot of workers
 or inhen aath sectoron main do saal main lagbhag paanch lakh naukariyaan hi paidaa ho sakin
 This is 10 times less than in 2009
 kam hua yaa zyada hua ye alag sawaal he lekin rojgaar srijan kaa koi thos or pramanik aankada nahin he jo sabhi sectoron kii tasviir pesh kar sake
 The government is currently saying that the new decision will create employment
 ab badhate hai agle sector kii taraf
 In the field of pharmaceutical companies, Greenfield Pharma has been 100 percent invested in Brown Field Pharma
 greenfield pharma matlab jab videshi nivesh se kisi nai company kii nai shuruuaat hoti he
 But when invested in an already existing company, it is called Brown Field Pharma
 brown field pharma main nivesh se adhigrahan or vilay kii prakriya aasaan ho jaaegi
 Only 74 per cent of foreign investment in greenfield and brown field will be through the automatic route
 uske aage sarkaar kii anumati zaruri hogi
 On June 10, several newspapers reported that the government was considering a proposal for foreign investment in pharmaceutical companies
 is maamle main chintaa vyakt kii jaati rahi he ki videshi companiyaan bhartiya companiyon kaa adhigrahan yaa vilay kar lengi to jenrik dawa udyog par khatra aa jayega
 Generics, ie unbranded medicines, become expensive
 is faisle par pharma company biokan limited kii kiran mazumdaar shaw ne twit kiya he ki pharma sector main videshi nivesh ko swat: manzuri maarg ke daayre main laana swaagat yogya kadam he
 It should have been done much earlier because this sector requires a lot of capital
 centre sarkaar ne haal hi main nai aviation niti kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Foreign investment in this sector has also been simplified
 iske tahat airport banane ke liye nae project main 100 fisadi videshi nivesh automatic root se ho sakegaa
 Government permission will have to be taken for investing more than 74% in old projects
 jo airport abhi chal rahe hai unhen aadhunik banane or yatriyon ke dabaav ko saral karne ke liye 100 fisadi videshi ho sakegaa
 There is no need for permission from the government where the brownfield airport project is already in operation
 privet security agency kshetra main bhi 49 se 74 fisadi nivesh sarkaar kii anumati se kiya ja sakegaa
 If i tell the story of the private security guard here, you will cry
 unke vetan, kaam kii kharaab suvidha
 What will be all right? kya sarkaar unki seva kii sharton or sthiti ko behatar karne ke liye bhi kuch kar sakati he
 The next sector is animal husbandry, aquaculture, fisheries, beekeeping and 100% foreigners are allowed
 pehle kuch sharton ke saath automatic root se nivesh ho saktaa tha
 The government has removed some of those conditions
 machhlee paalan to thik he lekin sahaj buddhi se ek sawaal to banataa he ki madhumakhi paalan main bhi hamen videshi nivesh kii zarurat he
 If village industry is not left, what is left? lekin yah jaanane kaa aap prayaas kijiega ki kya pataa ki is kshetra main videshi nivesh se vyapak sambhaavnaaen khul jaaen
 Now come to the ninth number sector
 single brands retail
 In this too, the scope of concessions has been enlarged due to the use of state-of-the-art technology
 sthaneey company par kharidari kii shart ko teen saal tak ke liye kar diya gaya he
 From the time of UPA, 100% foreign investment was made in single brand retail with certain conditions
 2012-13 ke saal main is sector main videshi nivesh ko lekar khub virodh hota tha
 Then it was said that if foreign retail companies come, then domestic retailers will be ruined
 daleel di jaati thi ki bijepi isliye virodh kar rahi he ki vyapaarik samudaay uskaa paaramparik vot bank rahaa he
 Just like the merchant class is not in single brand retail
 agar aap videshi nivesh ke masale par puraane raajnneetik bayanon kaa milan in faislon se karenge to kutarkon kaa pattern hi nazar aayega
 The comments tab bijepi videshi nivesh kaa virodh karti thi
 The BJP also said that the Congress was also opposed
 jab upie videshi nivesh ke darvaaze kholti thi to media aalochana ke liye bijepi kii taraf dekhtaa tha
 The BJP did not disappoint either
 endie kii sarkaar aati he to aise faislon ke vakt media congress kii taraf nahin, rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se jude bhartiya mazdoor sangh or swadeshi jaagran manch kii taraf dekhne lagata he
 These two organizations do not disappoint
 centre sarkaar ne jab raksha, beemaa or railway main videshi nivesh ko lekar apane sudhaaron kii ghoshnaa kii thi tab swadeshi jaagran manch ne khub virodh kiya bhi tha
 Now it seems that the Modi government has gone beyond the pressure of the Sangh in economic matters
 swadeshi jaagran manch kii pratikriya main ek dilachasp mode yah aayaa he ki swadeshi jaagran manch ke dhanraj bhide ne raksha kshetra main videshi nivesh kaa swaagat kiya he magar pashupaalan ke kshetra main nivesh ko lekar naaraaz ho gaye or ise rashtravirohi faisla bataa diya balki rashtradroh kah diya
 Since 2013, 100% investment in the telecom sector is allowed
 is sector kii haalat bahut acchhee to nahin he
 Its revenue growth 6 last year
 5 pratishat tha jo 2010 ke baad sabase kam he
 It appeared in the Times of India on 30 May 2016
 pehle is sector kii rajasav vruddhi do ankon main hua karti thi
 Do we know what level of progress has been made in the sectors where 100% investment is allowed
 aankadon kii itani ghor kami he ki sari bahes dharanaon ke hisaab kitaab main hi khatm ho jaati he
 What is the difference between advanced technology and modern technology
 kya aadhunik takanic unnt nahin hoti, yaa unnat takanic aadhunik nahin hoti
 Former Defense Minister AK Antony has termed these decisions a threat to national security
 vaise unke samay bhi aise faisle hue hai
 Defense critic Ajay Shukla, while reacting promptly, wrote that 100% investment in defense is a game of words
 upie ke samay se hi state of art tech ke aadhaar par anumati di gai thi
 Now it has been allowed from the root of modern technology
 ajay shukla kaa kahana he ki raksha mantralay ke paas aadhunik yaa state of di art technology kii koi paribhaasha nahin he
 So what needs to be introduced in this inter-defense sector as a foreign investment reform
 ajay shukla ne 9 june 2014 ko bijness standard akhbaar main likhaa tha ki 2006 se hi alag alag maamalon main raksha kshetra main 100 pratishat videshi nivesh kii anumati he
 He had then said that all this was being done for original equipment manufacturers since 2006 but not a single project came up
 maine ek vaikalpik raay bataa di lekin zaruri he ki har sector par thos jaankaree ke baad hi raay banaai jaae
 However, today the central government has decided to increase the amount of foreign investment in 9 sectors
 pradhanmantri ne ise november 2015 ke baad doosraa bada sudhaar kaha he
 However, with the permission of the government, 100 percent foreign investment will be made in the manufacture of food and beverage
 bharat main utpaadit or nirmit khaadya samagriyon ke i-kamrs main bhi 100 fisadi kii anumati di gai he
 100% foreign investment in the field of broadcasting such as DTH, cable network, mobile TV has been exempted from government processes
 centre sarkaar kaa kahana he ki 2015 ke vittiya varsh main 55 arab dollar se adhik kaa videshi nivesh hua he
 This is a record in any one financial year
 bharat sarkaar ne kaha he ki rojgaar badhaane ke liye somvaar ko itnaa bada faisla liya gaya
 We are not in a position to tell how much employment has been or is going to be created from the record foreign investment that has come from 2014 to 2016
 first post website par sindhu bhattacharya ne 15 april 2016 ko lekh likhaa ki modi sarkaar ke do varshon main aath sectoron main rojgaar kii raftaar dhimi hui he
 This information is based on the report of the Labor Bureau, Government of India
 kapadaa udyog, chamada udyog, dhaatu udyog, automobil, ratna or jawaharaat, parivahan or iti or bipio, handloom powerloom in aath sectoron main mazaduron kii kaaphi zarurat padati he
 And in these eight sectors only about five lakh jobs could be created in two years
 2009 kii tulana main ye 10 guna kam he
 It is a different question, whether it is reduced or increased, but there is no concrete and authentic data of employment generation which can present the picture of all sectors
 philhal sarkaar kah rahi he ki nae faisle se rojgaar kaa srijan hoga
 Now let's move to the next sector
 dawa companiyon ke kshetra main greenfield pharma brown field pharma main 100 fisadi nivesh kar diya gaya he
 Greenfield Pharma means when a new company is born with foreign investment
 lekin jab pehle se maujuud kisi company main nivesh kiya jaae to use brown field pharma kehete hai
 Investing in Brown Field Pharma will make the acquisition and merger process easier
 greenfield or brown field main 74 fisadi videshi nivesh hi automatic root se hoga
 Further government permission will be required
 10 june ko kai akhabaaron main khabar chhapi thi ki sarkaar dawa companiyon main videshi nivesh ke prastaav par vichaar kar rahi he
 Concern has been expressed in this case that the generic pharmaceutical industry will be threatened if foreign companies take over or merge with Indian companies
 jenrik yani bina brands kii dawaaen mahangi ho jaati hai
 On this decision, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw of pharma company Biocon Limited tweeted that it is a welcome step to bring foreign investment in the pharma sector under the automatic approval route
 ise bahut pehle hi kar diya janaa chahie tha kyonki is sector ko bahut puunji kii zarurat hoti he
 The central government has recently announced a new aviation policy
 is sector main bhi videshi nivesh ko saral bana diya gaya he
 Under this, 100% foreign investment in the new project will be made through the automatic route to build the airport
 puraane project main 74 fisadi se zyaada nivesh karne par sarkaar kii anumati leni hogi
 To modernize the airports which are running now and to ease the pressure of passengers, 100% foreigners will be able to
 brownfield airport project yani jahaan pehle se kaam chal rahaa ho vahaan sarkaar se anumati kii koi zarurat nahin he
 In the private security agency sector, 49 to 74 percent investment can be done with the permission of the government
 privet security guard kii dastaan yahaan sunaauungaa to aap ro denge
 Their salaries, poor work facilities
 ye sab kya thik ho paaegaa
 Can the government do anything to improve their conditions and conditions of service? aglaa sector he pashupaalan, jalakheti, machhlipaalan, madhumakhipaalan main 100 fisadi videshi kii anumati di gai he
 Earlier investment could be done through automatic route with some conditions
 sarkaar ne un kuch sharton ko hataa diya he
 Fish farming is fine, but a question arises from natural intelligence that we also need foreign investment in bee keeping
 gramodyog bhi nahin bachaa to kya bachaa
 But you will try to know whether foreign investment in this field opens up huge possibilities
 ab aate hai naunve number ke sector par
 Single Brand Retail
 isamen bhi atyaadhunik takniki ke bahaane riyaayaton kaa dayera bada kar diya gaya he
 The condition of the purchase at the local company has been extended to three years
 upie ke samay se hi single brands retail main kuch sharton ke saath sau fisadi videshi nivesh kar diya gaya tha
 In the year 2012-13, there was a lot of opposition to foreign investment in this sector
 tab bataaya jaataa tha ki videshi retail companiyaan aaengi to desi khudara vyapaaree barbaad ho jaaenge
 It was argued that the BJP is protesting that the business community has been its traditional vote bank
 jaise vyapaaree varg single brands retail main he hi nahin
 If you match the old political statements on the issue of foreign investment with these decisions, then the pattern of misdeeds will be seen
 tippaniyan The BJP then opposed foreign investment
 bijepi yah bhi kahati thi ki congress bhi to virodh karti thi
 When the UPA opened the doors to foreign investment, the media looked to the BJP for criticism
 bijepi niraash bhi nahin karti thi
 When the NDA government comes, during such decisions, the media does not look towards the Congress, but towards the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh and Swadeshi Jagran Manch associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 ye donon sanghathan niraash nahin karte
 When the central government announced its reforms regarding foreign investment in defense, insurance and railways, the Swadeshi Jagran Manch was also strongly opposed
 ab lagata he ki modi sarkaar aarthik maamalon main sangh ke dabaav se bhi aage ja chuki he
 An interesting twist in the response of Swadeshi Jagran Manch is that Dhanraj Bhide of Swadeshi Jagran Manch has welcomed foreign investment in defense sector but got angry about investment in animal husbandry sector and called it anti national decision but called treason 
 2013 se telecom sector main sau fisadi nivesh kii anumati he
 The condition of this sector is not very good
 pichley saal iskaa rajasav growth 6
 5 percent which is the lowest since 2010
 30 may 2016 ko times of india main ye chapa he
 Earlier this sector used to have double-digit revenue growth
 kya ham jaanate hai ki sau fisadi nivesh kii anumati jin sectoron main hai vahaan kis str kii pragati hui he
 There is such a huge lack of data that all the debate ends in the book itself according to the assumptions
 ajay shukla ne 9 june 2014 ko bijness standard akhbaar main likhaa tha ki 2006 se hi alag alag maamalon main raksha kshetra main 100 pratishat videshi nivesh kii anumati he

 upie ke samay se hi single brands retail main kuch sharton ke saath sau fisadi videshi nivesh kar diya gaya tha
 In the year 2012-13, there was a lot of opposition to foreign investment in this sector
 tab bataaya jaataa tha ki videshi retail companiyaan aaengi to desi khudara vyapaaree barbaad ho jaaenge
 It was argued that the BJP is protesting that the business community has been its traditional vote bank
 jaise vyapaaree varg single brands retail main he hi nahin
 If you match the old political statements on the issue of foreign investment with these decisions, then the pattern of misdeeds will be seen
 tippaniyan The BJP then opposed foreign investment
 bijepi yah bhi kahati thi ki congress bhi to virodh karti thi
 When the UPA opened the doors to foreign investment, the media looked to the BJP for criticism
 bijepi niraash bhi nahin karti thi
 When the NDA government comes, during such decisions, the media does not look towards the Congress, but towards the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh and Swadeshi Jagran Manch associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 ye donon sanghathan niraash nahin karte
 When the central government announced its reforms regarding foreign investment in defense, insurance and railways, the Swadeshi Jagran Manch was also strongly opposed
 ab lagata he ki modi sarkaar aarthik maamalon main sangh ke dabaav se bhi aage ja chuki he
 An interesting twist in the response of Swadeshi Jagran Manch is that Dhanraj Bhide of Swadeshi Jagran Manch has welcomed foreign investment in defense sector but got angry about investment in animal husbandry sector and called it anti national decision but called treason 
 2013 se telecom sector main sau fisadi nivesh kii anumati he
 The condition of this sector is not very good
 pichley saal iskaa rajasav growth 6
 5 percent which is the lowest since 2010
 30 may 2016 ko times of india main ye chapa he
 Earlier this sector used to have double-digit revenue growth
 kya ham jaanate hai ki sau fisadi nivesh kii anumati jin sectoron main hai vahaan kis str kii pragati hui he
 There is such a huge lack of data that all the debate ends in the book itself according to the assumptions
 kapadaa udyog, chamada udyog, dhaatu udyog, automobil, ratna or jawaharaat, parivahan or iti or bipio, handloom powerloom in aath sectoron main mazaduron kii kaaphi zarurat padati he
 And in these eight sectors only about five lakh jobs could be created in two years
 2009 kii tulana main ye 10 guna kam he
 It is a different question, whether it is reduced or increased, but there is no concrete and authentic data of employment generation which can present the picture of all sectors
 philhal sarkaar kah rahi he ki nae faisle se rojgaar kaa srijan hoga
 Now let's move to the next sector
 dawa companiyon ke kshetra main greenfield pharma brown field pharma main 100 fisadi nivesh kar diya gaya he
 Greenfield Pharma means when a new company is born with foreign investment
 lekin jab pehle se maujuud kisi company main nivesh kiya jaae to use brown field pharma kehete hai
 Investing in Brown Field Pharma will make the acquisition and merger process easier
 greenfield or brown field main 74 fisadi videshi nivesh hi automatic root se hoga
 Further government permission will be required
 10 june ko kai akhabaaron main khabar chhapi thi ki sarkaar dawa companiyon main videshi nivesh ke prastaav par vichaar kar rahi he
 Concern has been expressed in this case that the generic pharmaceutical industry will be threatened if foreign companies take over or merge with Indian companies
 jenrik yani bina brands kii dawaaen mahangi ho jaati hai
 On this decision, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw of pharma company Biocon Limited tweeted that it is a welcome step to bring foreign investment in the pharma sector under the automatic approval route
 ise bahut pehle hi kar diya janaa chahie tha kyonki is sector ko bahut puunji kii zarurat hoti he
 The central government has recently announced a new aviation policy
 is sector main bhi videshi nivesh ko saral bana diya gaya he
 Under this, 100% foreign investment in the new project will be made through the automatic route to build the airport
 puraane project main 74 fisadi se zyaada nivesh karne par sarkaar kii anumati leni hogi
 To modernize the airports which are running now and to ease the pressure of passengers, 100% foreigners will be able to
 brownfield airport project yani jahaan pehle se kaam chal rahaa ho vahaan sarkaar se anumati kii koi zarurat nahin he
 In the private security agency sector, 49 to 74 percent investment can be done with the permission of the government
 privet security guard kii dastaan yahaan sunaauungaa to aap ro denge
 Their salaries, poor work facilities
 ye sab kya thik ho paaegaa
 Can the government do anything to improve their conditions and conditions of service? aglaa sector he pashupaalan, jalakheti, machhlipaalan, madhumakhipaalan main 100 fisadi videshi kii anumati di gai he
 Earlier investment could be done through automatic route with some conditions
 sarkaar ne un kuch sharton ko hataa diya he
 Fish farming is fine, but a question arises from natural intelligence that we also need foreign investment in bee keeping
 gramodyog bhi nahin bachaa to kya bachaa
 But you will try to know whether foreign investment in this field opens up huge possibilities
 ab aate hai naunve number ke sector par
 Single Brand Retail
 isamen bhi atyaadhunik takniki ke bahaane riyaayaton kaa dayera bada kar diya gaya he
 The condition of the purchase at the local company has been extended to three years
 upie ke samay se hi single brands retail main kuch sharton ke saath sau fisadi videshi nivesh kar diya gaya tha
 In the year 2012-13, there was a lot of opposition to foreign investment in this sector
 tab bataaya jaataa tha ki videshi retail companiyaan aaengi to desi khudara vyapaaree barbaad ho jaaenge
 It was argued that the BJP is protesting that the business community has been its traditional vote bank

 There is such a huge lack of data that all the debate ends in the book itself according to the assumptions
 ab badhate hai agle sector kii taraf
 In the field of pharmaceutical companies, Greenfield Pharma has been 100 percent invested in Brown Field Pharma
 greenfield pharma matlab jab videshi nivesh se kisi nai company kii nai shuruuaat hoti he
 But when invested in an already existing company, it is called Brown Field Pharma
 brown field pharma main nivesh se adhigrahan or vilay kii prakriya aasaan ho jaaegi
 Only 74 per cent of foreign investment in greenfield and brown field will be through the automatic route
 uske aage sarkaar kii anumati zaruri hogi
 On June 10, several newspapers reported that the government was considering a proposal for foreign investment in pharmaceutical companies
 is maamle main chintaa vyakt kii jaati rahi he ki videshi companiyaan bhartiya companiyon kaa adhigrahan yaa vilay kar lengi to jenrik dawa udyog par khatra aa jayega
 Generics, ie unbranded medicines, become expensive
 is faisle par pharma company biokan limited kii kiran mazumdaar shaw ne twit kiya he ki pharma sector main videshi nivesh ko swat: manzuri maarg ke daayre main laana swaagat yogya kadam he
 It should have been done much earlier because this sector requires a lot of capital
 centre sarkaar ne haal hi main nai aviation niti kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Foreign investment in this sector has also been simplified
 iske tahat airport banane ke liye nae project main 100 fisadi videshi nivesh automatic root se ho sakegaa
 Government permission will have to be taken for investing more than 74% in old projects
 jo airport abhi chal rahe hai unhen aadhunik banane or yatriyon ke dabaav ko saral karne ke liye 100 fisadi videshi ho sakegaa
 There is no need for permission from the government where the brownfield airport project is already in operation
 privet security agency kshetra main bhi 49 se 74 fisadi nivesh sarkaar kii anumati se kiya ja sakegaa
 If i tell the story of the private security guard here, you will cry
 unke vetan, kaam kii kharaab suvidha
 What will be all right? kya sarkaar unki seva kii sharton or sthiti ko behatar karne ke liye bhi kuch kar sakati he
 The next sector is animal husbandry, aquaculture, fisheries, beekeeping and 100% foreigners are allowed
 pehle kuch sharton ke saath automatic root se nivesh ho saktaa tha
 The government has removed some of those conditions
 machhlee paalan to thik he lekin sahaj buddhi se ek sawaal to banataa he ki madhumakhi paalan main bhi hamen videshi nivesh kii zarurat he
 If village industry is not left, what is left? lekin yah jaanane kaa aap prayaas kijiega ki kya pataa ki is kshetra main videshi nivesh se vyapak sambhaavnaaen khul jaaen
 Now come to the ninth number sector
 single brands retail
 In this too, the scope of concessions has been enlarged due to the use of state-of-the-art technology
 sthaneey company par kharidari kii shart ko teen saal tak ke liye kar diya gaya he
 From the time of UPA, 100% foreign investment was made in single brand retail with certain conditions
 2012-13 ke saal main is sector main videshi nivesh ko lekar khub virodh hota tha
 Then it was said that if foreign retail companies come, then domestic retailers will be ruined
 daleel di jaati thi ki bijepi isliye virodh kar rahi he ki vyapaarik samudaay uskaa paaramparik vot bank rahaa he
 Just like the merchant class is not in single brand retail
 agar aap videshi nivesh ke masale par puraane raajnneetik bayanon kaa milan in faislon se karenge to kutarkon kaa pattern hi nazar aayega
 The comments tab bijepi videshi nivesh kaa virodh karti thi
 The BJP also said that the Congress was also opposed
 jab upie videshi nivesh ke darvaaze kholti thi to media aalochana ke liye bijepi kii taraf dekhtaa tha
 The BJP did not disappoint either
 endie kii sarkaar aati he to aise faislon ke vakt media congress kii taraf nahin, rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se jude bhartiya mazdoor sangh or swadeshi jaagran manch kii taraf dekhne lagata he
 These two organizations do not disappoint
 centre sarkaar ne jab raksha, beemaa or railway main videshi nivesh ko lekar apane sudhaaron kii ghoshnaa kii thi tab swadeshi jaagran manch ne khub virodh kiya bhi tha
 Now it seems that the Modi government has gone beyond the pressure of the Sangh in economic matters
 swadeshi jaagran manch kii pratikriya main ek dilachasp mode yah aayaa he ki swadeshi jaagran manch ke dhanraj bhide ne raksha kshetra main videshi nivesh kaa swaagat kiya he magar pashupaalan ke kshetra main nivesh ko lekar naaraaz ho gaye or ise rashtravirohi faisla bataa diya balki rashtradroh kah diya
 Since 2013, 100% investment in the telecom sector is allowed
 is sector kii haalat bahut acchhee to nahin he
 Its revenue growth 6 last year
 5 pratishat tha jo 2010 ke baad sabase kam he
 It appeared in the Times of India on 30 May 2016
 pehle is sector kii rajasav vruddhi do ankon main hua karti thi
 Do we know what level of progress has been made in the sectors where 100% investment is allowed
 aankadon kii itani ghor kami he ki sari bahes dharanaon ke hisaab kitaab main hi khatm ho jaati he

 The final hearing of the Ayodhya case in the Supreme Court is to end by October 17
 The arguments of both sides will be kept by the Muslim side and the Hindu side
 The time has come for the climax of the hearing in Ayodhya's ramjanmabhoomi-babri Masjid dispute
 chif justise ranjan gogoi ne is maamle kii sunwaayee ko 17 oktober tak khatm karne kii apil kii thi, aise main ab sunwaayee ke liye aakhri chaar din hai
 If the hearing is completed in the next few days, then the expectation of a decision in this case may increase
 is maamle main aakhri sunwaayee se pehle ayodhya jile main suraksha ko badhaayaa gaya he, 10 disambar tak puure jile main dhara 144 ko lagu kar diya gaya he
 So that if some environment worsens with the decision, it can be controlled
 aakhri chaar din kii sunwaayee main kya hoga?chif justise ranjan gogoi is maamle kii sunwaayee ko samaysima main khatm karne ko kai baar kah chuke hai or saath hi ye bhi kaha tha ki agar samay se sunwaayee khatm nahin hoti he to samay par faisla aane kii ummid bhi khatm ho jaaegi
 Now when the hearing is going on after Dussehra, let us understand what is the meaning of this last phase in the court
 
 
 # supreme court main abhi pakshakaron kii taraf se aakhri daleelein rakhi ja rahi hai, adaalat ke dwaara die gaye samay ke anusaar 14 oktober tak muslim paksh kii daleel khatm honi he
 # 15 and 16 October, advocates for the Hindu party will respond to the pleas of the Muslim side, as well as submit their final remarks to the court

 But Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi had last commented that we will have to end the case within the deadline, if the hearing ends by October 18, we will also need a month to write the verdict
 agar ek maheene kaa samay dekhen to november ke aakhri tak is maamle main koi bada faisla ho saktaa he

 Between November 1 and November 13, 1600 trains are lying down

 However, whatever the claims of putting devices in trains, trains are getting late

 After the Modi government came to power, it was planned to put the Trinetra device on the train for its diagnosis

 Officials of the Railway Board say that the products of different companies have been tested regarding Trinetra, a decision will be taken soon

 The Railway Minister said this at a time when the Railway Ministry was troubled by many railway accidents
 baar-baar direl hoti trainon ko lekar rail mantralay ne sefti ke kaam ko tarjeeh di he
 The Railway Ministry has directed to eliminate all level crossing gates by 2018

 According to the preparations for another announcement before the election, the Finance Ministry is currently evaluating small savings schemes to increase interest rates

 Interest rate on provident fund deposits for 2018-19 from Employees' Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) 8

 This will benefit pension holders, elders, farmers, and mainly those dependent on income from the interest of small savings, once the change in interest rates comes into effect
 sutara ne bataaya ki byaaj daron main kitni vruddhi hogi or kin yojanaon ko isamen shaamil kiya jayega is par abhi vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 He said that this change can be done when the announcement of election dates is near, because the move is aimed at benefiting millions of small savers across the country

 After the meeting of the newly formed Civil Aviation Economic Advisory Council, Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel said, "the fares of the planes need to be controlled
 hamane pehle hi vimaanan companiyon ko is sambandh main or kadam uthaane kii salaah di he
 The council has decided to set up a small working group comprising representatives of aviation companies and representatives of passenger organizations to ensure 'transparency' in fixing fares keeping in mind the guidelines of Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)

 If Lalu Prasad has any concern about the verdict on July 15 in the fodder scam case, then his medical check-up in Patna's home on June 25 would not have been reflected at all
 rashtriya janata dal (argedy) pramukh khush the, unki nabj, blad pressure, sugar level or sehat se jude anya sanketak ekadam durust the, bilkul unki rajnatik sambhaavnaaon kii tarah
 After Nitish Kumar's separation from the BJP, Lalu's election hopes, long marginalized in the state's politics, have begun to pick up again
 lalu prasad ne india today se baatcheet main daawa kiya,''bihar lalu prasad or narendra modi ke bich hone vaali ladaai kii ore bad rahaa he
 After Nitish Kumar's pretense of breaking ties with BJP for minority votes, they have become irrelevant
 donon partiyon kii raahen juda hone se pehle ke endie ke voton main se 80 pratishat par ab bijepi kaa kabja he
 "lalu can now show the courage to speak so openly
" vajah: 5 june ko maharajaganj loksabhaa upachunaav main unke ummidavaar prabhunath singh ne nitish sarkaar main mantri pi

 37 lakh voton se karaari shikast di
 Lalu Prasad seems to have a political rebirth with the BJP-JD (U) alliance breaking after 16 years on 16 June
 unke dushman bant gaye hai or bihar main bahukoniya muqabla tay he jo lalu ke liye phydemand ho saktaa he
 The outward crowd gathered in Lalu's Parivartan rally before the by-election is also a positive sign
 lekin jab argedy pramukh jabardast vaapasi ke liye taiyaar dikhe tabhi 17 saal se soya hua ek cese sir uthaane laga he

 in Ranchi ke singh ne 20 june ko tay kiya ki ve 15 july ko faisla sunaayenge
 With this, Lalu's political future has become increasingly dark

 Since then, speculation is rife that Lalu will be punished
 sibiai jaj pi
 K

 ke shahi ke rishtedaar hai
 Lalu fears that his decision will not be impartial, so he appealed to the High Court to change the court, but after the petition is rejected, Lalu Prasad has no option but to wait for the verdict till July 15
 lalu jaanate hai ki ve bijepi-jedy (you) gathbandhan tuutane kaa phayda tabhi uthaa sakate hai, jab jail se baahar rahen, lekin aisi koi guarantee na hone kii vajah se unhone plan bi yaa kahen duusari yojana par kaam karnaa bhi shuru kar diya he
 According to party insiders, they are taking the big leaders of the RJD into confidence about plans for a temporary change in leadership
 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav main shikast ke baad samaj jane laga tha ki rabari devi nepathy main chali gai hai, lekin april, 2012 main unhen vidhaan parishad kaa sadsy banwaaya gaya
 If Lalu Prasad is punished, he will take command
 party adhyaksh unhen yaa kisi duusare varisht netaa ko kaamkaaji adhyaksh ghoshit kar sakate hai
 Lalu Prasad is preparing his younger son Tejashwi Yadav as his successor, but he lacks experience to support his mother
 isliye samaj jaataa he ki lalu prasad apni sabase badi doctor beti misa bharti ko raajnneeti main le aae hai
 Misa has two children and may possibly stand in the next Lok Sabha election
 1997 main to lalu ne hadabadi main rabari devi ko mukhyamantri kii kursi par baitha diya tha, or us samay ve raajnneeti main maahir bhi nahin thim
 But this time they have prepared a team to run the party
 kanoonee ladaai ke saath-saath lalu ko congress ke bina jeene kii bhi taiyaari kerani hogi
 a vote of four Congress mlas in support of Nitish's vote of confidence in the Assembly on June 19 made it clear that UPA-2 preferred 20 Lok Sabha mps of JDU over Lalu's four RJD mps
 agar congress ne nitish se gathbandhan kar liya to kuch muslim vot lalu ke haath se nikal sakate hai
 Around 16 in the state
 5 ' muslim hai jo akasar us party yaa gathbandhan ko vot dete hai jo rashtriya str par bijepi ko maat dene kaa madda rakhata ho
 The Congress is making inroads in the matter of alliance
 argedy ke ek saansad kii maane to, ''agar lalu prasad ko sajaa hui to congress unhen chhod sakati he anyathaa vah argedy or jedy(you) donon se dostana rakhegi
 "there is a trick in Lalu's mind
" bihar main nitish ko congress ke samarthan ke baavjood lalu ösaad kendrr main congress ke netritv vaali sarkaar kaa saream samarthan karte rahenge
 RJD leaders have been asked to openly publicize Nitish's alleged allegiance to BJP leader LK Advani
 argedy ne 2009 main loksabhaa or 2010 main rajya vidhansabha chunaav main congress ke saath gathbandhan nahin kiya tha
 It is understood that at that time he got nearly half the Muslim votes in Bihar on both occasions
 lalu ösaad kehete hai, ''musalmaan jaanate hai ki main rashtriya str par congress kaa samarthan karuunga
 i am not like Nitish who rode on the backs of communal BJP to become the Chief Minister
 '' lalu prasad or nitish, donon samaajawaadee hone ke baavjood congress ko lubhaane main lage hai
 Both had political beginnings due to opposition from Congress and were together till 1994
 donon jaanate hai ki ve ek duusare ko mitaakar hi raajnneeti main apana astitv bachaae rakh sakate hai
 On one hand BJP is distributing cds of Nitish's qasidas in the honor of Narendra Modi, on the other hand RJD is promoting LK Advani's speeches in the glory of Nitish Kumar
 is bich lalu prasad rajput, yadav or muslim kaa nayaa saamaajik sameekaran banane par kaam rahe hai, jisane maharajaganj upachunaav jeetne main unki madad kii
 Three of the rjd's four Lok Sabha mps are Rajputs
 rajnatik virodhiyon ke bich rassakashi ko dekhte hue lalu prasad ko yakeen he ki bahukoniya mukaable main unhen phayda hoga, lekin ve shaayad is baat kii andekhi kar rahe he ki agar nitish or congress kaa bijepi virdohi gathbandhan ban gaya to bihar kii raajnneeti main lalu yadav kii jagah sikud sakati he
 a party MP describes these entire situations in this way, "if Lalu Prasad is acquitted, he will benefit
" agar kuch din kii jail hoti he to usase sahanubhuti kii lahar jarur jaagegi or jo unka rajnatik bhavishya sanvaaregi
 But Lalu Prasad is the real strength of RJD
 isliye zyada lambii jail argedy ke liye mushkilen bhi khadi kar sakati he
 "I will have to fight two BJP in Bihar

 ek se zyada sex partner, kam umr main shaadi, anhaijinic condishan- ye kuch aise kaaran hai, jiske chalate desh main servix cancer (cervix Cancer) ke maamle teji se bad rahe hai
 Earlier this cancer was seen more in the women of the village, but nowadays the infiltration of this disease has increased in the lifestyle of the metros
 darasal sex ke daayre main badlaav, kam umr kii ladakiyon kaa sex ke prati jhukaav is cancer ko teji se badha rahaa he
 Let us tell you that every year about 74 thousand women in the country become victims of death due to cervix cancer
 har saal desh main ek lakh 32 hajaar ke kareeb servix cancer ke nae maamle saamne aate hai
 It is a matter of concern that pre-cervix cancer symptoms are seen in 17-18 year old girls
 aise main desh main pehali baar ek aisi divaais banaai gai he, jisase badi aasaani se pre-servix cancer ke lakshanon ko pahchaan kar uskaa ilaaj shuru kiya ja saktaa he
 The important thing is that the reliability level of this device is close to 95 percent
 yahaan yah jaananaa bhi jaruri he ki yadi is cancer kii pahchaan shuru main hi ho jaae, to ise 99-100 fisadi tak thik kiya ja saktaa he
 After the onset of cancer, it takes up to 10 years to develop fully
 health ministar gulam nabi aaazaad ne is divaais ko somvaar ko launch kiya he, jiskaa naam rakhaa gaya he avi magnivijualizer
 It has been prepared by the team of Indian Council for Medical Research
 acchhee baat yah he ki bydaree se chalane vaali is divaais kaa istemaal karne ke liye kisi bhi lab yaa anbhavi doctor kii jarurat nahin hoti he
 This device can also be used easily by training paramedical staff
 iske magniphying glass kii madad se ladakiyon, mahilaon kii jaanch ke dauraan unamem pre-cancer lakshanon ko pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 The most special thing about this device is its price, which is around 10 thousand rupees
 isse test kii keemat 22 se 23 rupee ke bich aegi
 It is expected that in the coming few months it will be launched from major hospitals in the country to primary center
 abhi tak servix cancer kii jaanch ke liye pepsmer jaanch takanic uplabdh he, lekin iske liye lab ke saath-saath anbhavi haathon kii bhi jarurat hoti he
 It is expected that with the arrival of this device, girls and women will be able to get tested easily at a young age and they will be able to identify the risk of cervix cancer and start treatment
 film 'khap' haryana kii khap panchayat par he
 Khap panchayat means a mahapanchayat consisting of 40 villages panchayat, which believes that boys and girls of the same gotra or khap are like siblings and hence they cannot marry among themselves
 real life main bhi aisi shaadi karne vaale kai jodon ko yaa to maar diya gaya yaa phir unhen alag karke raakhi baandh di gai
 However, the film is based on Modern Delhi girl Riya Yuvika Chaudhary who reaches a village on a college tour where her estranged grandfather Om Puri lives
 riya ke pita mohanish bahal human ritis kamishan main kaam karte hai or unhone apni beti ko dadaji ke bare main kabhi kuch nahin bataaya kyonki dada khap panchayat ke president hai or ek hi gautra main shaadi karne waalon par julm dha rahe hai
 The granddaughter's romance, Dada's excesses and attempts to show the confession of the son, entangled between humanity and duty, are in this film, but regrettably the story is given a very immature treatment
 'khap' jaisi film bade gambhir mudde par banaai jaati he lekin ise banane ke liye jis gahari or thos script kii jarurat thi wo yahaan nahin dikhti
 Although Om Puri, Manoj Pahwa, Mohnish Bahl and Govind Namdev have done good acting
 baap-bete ke bich kuch achche imotional seens bhi hai
 Khap is an issue that draws both new and old generations, but director Ajay Sinha missed this opportunity
 shahari yuvaaon ko saste romance or masala sangs parosane ke chakkar main film kii syriasnes khatm ho gai
 My rating for Khap is 2 stars

 Behind the murder of a Delhi college student is the hand of a mentally disturbed young man from Uttar Pradesh who wanted to avenge his humiliation
 police ne kaha ki is yuvak kii teen saal pehle ladki kaa peechha karne ko lekar pitayee kar di gayi thi
 The alleged killer has been identified as Vijay alias Ram Singh (25), a resident of Viswan village in Sitapur district of Uttar Pradesh
 police ne vijay ke do doston tabrej or ashraf ko hiraasat main lekar poochtacha karne ke baad hatyare kaa pataa lagaaya
 The duo had helped in giving shelter to Vijay after shooting and killing Radhika Tanwar (20) outside Ramlal Anand College in South Delhi and fleeing the capital two days later on 10 March
 tanvar isi college main adhyayanrat thi
 Deputy Commissioner of Police (south) HGS Dhaliwal told reporters, 'his real name is Ram Singh but he lives in Delhi under the name of Vijay
 jaanch se pataa chalaa he ki vah maansik rup se ashaant he
 It is learned that he used to chase women even in the village
 ’dhaliwal ne kaha, ‘police ne vijay ke jin do doston ko hiraasat main liya he, unhone bataaya ki radhika ke kathith utpeedan ke chalate nivaasiyon ne usko saadhe teen saal pehle peeta tha or vah apane apmaan kaa badla lenaa chahta tha
 He said, 'he was very angry about Radhika and he used to tell his friends often that he would take revenge on the girl if he got a chance
 ’ pitayee ke baad vah dilli chhodkar mumbai chalaa gaya
 He returned to the capital 45 days ago and contacted his former employer Kamal for the job but was denied the job due to his alleged involvement in the chase cases
 iske baad vijay ne rohinee main apane mitron se sampark kiya tha
 Dhaliwal said, 'after the murder, Vijay went to his friend's house where he stayed till Thursday
 usne unhen bataaya ki narayana main uskaa jhagada ho gaya tha
 But after this news surfaced in the media in a big way, he felt that his arrest could be done soon
 vijay ke mitra use gudgaanv main ek or parichit ke paas le gayi jisane use sahaayta dene se inkaar kar diya
 After this, Tabrez and Ashraf took Vijay to Gurgaon railway station and they left him there
 ’tabrej or ashraf ko shuukravaar ko sitapur se hiraasat main le liya gaya
 All three worked in knitting and sewing units
 police un yuvakon tak kaise pahunchi, jinhone vijay kii madad kii thi, is sawaal ke jawaab main police adhikari ne kaha ki jin logon ko purv main peechha karne ke chalate peeta gaya tha, unke parichiton ke ricard se police in donon yuvakon tak pahunchi

 kolkata main 18 june ko trinmul congress (tiemasi) ke ek khule manch se mamata banerjee ne ek badi naammumkin sareekhee sweekaarokti kar daali
 He expressed disappointment over the fact that the Trinamool has been steeped in corruption troughs at the bottom and now the time has come to overcome it vigorously
 mamata ne kaha bhi, ''mujhe party main chor nahin chahie
 Those who have taken money from people, go and return it to them
 aap log to murdon ko bhi nahin chhod rahe hai or garibon ko apane parijanon ke antim sanskaar ke liye sarkaar se mil rahe 2,000 rupye main se bhi 10 fisadi kamishan vasuul le rahe hai
 With this remark, the Chief Minister of West Bengal removed the curtain from the culture of 'cut recovery', about which the BJP has always alleged that it has gained legitimacy under the Trinamool rule in Bengal
 aarope rahaa he ki garib se garib vyakti ko bhi centre yaa rajya sarkaar kaa koi anudaan hasil karne ke liye sthaneey tiemasi netaaon ko kamishan dena padataa he
 But this confession of Mamta could not have been worse
 iskaa mul makasad bhale hi chhavi ko badalane kii kavayad karne kaa rahaa ho lekin prachaar main iskaa asar ulataa rahaa or isane vipakshi dalon ko trinmul ke khilaaf nae hathiyaar de die hai
 The BJP is staging protests across the state and it is alleged that the cadres who filed police complaints against the recruits are being attacked by Trinamool people
 kai jagahon par sthaneey trinmul netaaon kii un logon ne gheraabandi bhi kii he jo jad tak pahunche is bhrashtachar se peedit rahe hai
 One of these is also poor villagers like Shankar Bagdi
 'keemat' to chukaani hogibaghdi birbhum jile ke santhia ilaake main pikpaada se hai
 He applied for a grant under the Pradhan Mantri Awas yojana-gramin (PMAY-G) to build a pucca house
 teen saal pehle jab se unka naam labhaarthiyon kii suchi main aayaa tha, tab se bagdi trinmul ke sthaneey daftaron ke chakkar kaate ja rahe hai or panchayat ke sadasyon se mil rahe hai
 It is alleged that this year when he paid Rs 7,000 to the local mentors of Trinamool
 kii rishwat di tab jaakar piemevai kii 40,000 ru
 He got the first installment of chunki ve or 3,000 ru
 Failing to pay a bribe, he is afraid that he will not get the remaining 80,000 rupees of the grant
 lihaaja is monsoon main bagdi kaa makaan adhbana hi rah gaya he—uski na chat he or na hi deevaaren
 The grant received under government schemes is actually direct benefit transfer
 lekin labhaarthi aarope lagaate hai ki cat-vasuuli kii maang karne vaale trinmul ke netaa unke bank or post offis dastavej jaise passbook or nagad nikasi parchi aadi kabje main kar lete hai
 Sukhdev Dolui, who lives in a village in Hatora Panchayat in Birbhum, says, "they return the papers only after withdrawing every penny of the grant money
" hamen paisa nikasi parchi par dastakhat kar unhen saunpane ke liye majaboor kiya jaataa he
 "now whether it is MNREGA salary, grant to build toilets, PMAY-G money or recruitment of school teachers, no work goes ahead without paying 'price'
 hathoda panchayat ke nivasee shyaamal bagdi kehete hai, ''mujhe manaregaa job card ke liye 7,000 ru
 Had to bribe
 jab main bakaayaa lene ke liye gaya to paaya ki panchayat record main mere job card ke aage do anya naam likhe hue the
 They allege that the Trinamool leader and the panchayat president cheated her
 birbhum jila parishad ke sabhadhipati bikaash raichoudhary kaa kahana he ki pikpaada or belia main manaregaa ke tahat 22 lakh ru
 The investigation of the disturbances is underway
 unhone bharosa dilaayaa ki doshiyon par kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 Critics say that such corruption was also present in the Left Front regime but in remote places
 vahaan bhi vah kaam puri tarah se chori-chhipe hota tha
 Manoj Chakraborty, the Congress' chief whip in the assembly, says, "one has to pay the price, whether it is to get government funds, or to get jobs in schools and government offices or to get admission in college or bed in hospital
" for
 aath saal (trinmul ke shasankaal) main yah saamaanya prakriya ho gai he
 "timeline of confession - Mamta's confession about recovery has only increased the crisis in Trinamool
" mamata is baat se bhi waakif hai ki bhaajapa kii chunauti se jujhane ke liye party kaa punargathan karne or isaki nai branding karne kaa matlab hoga ekadam nae sire se shuruyaat karnaa
 The Trinamool suffered its biggest defeat in the Lok Sabha elections so far when its seats fell from 34 in 2014 to 22 in 2019
 bhaajapa kaa vot pratishat 40 fisadi ho gaya or siton kii sankhya pichley chunaavon main do se badhkar 18 ho gai
 This is his best performance in Bengal
 vah ab 2021 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main rajya main satta par kabja karne kii firaaq main he
 Sadma Khai Mamta's frustration with these results is evident in many recent incidents
 jaise ki jai shri ram kaa naaraa lagane vaale bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon ke saath sadak par bavaal, bangla na bolne ke liye 'bahari' logon ke khilaaf gussa or pichley maheene doctoron kii hadtaal se nibatane main kotahi
 Apart from this, he is also faced with a large number of party leaders changing sides and joining BJP
 kolkata kii presidency uniwarsity mank professor ameritas or samaaj vigyaani prashanth re kaa kahana he, ''mamata banerjee ko apni party par bhaajapa ke nirantar akraman se logon kaa dhyaan hataane ke liye koi to krantikari kadam uthaanaa hi tha
 'cut-money' has been a major complaint among common people
 logon kii shikaayat par dhyaan dene or unase phir se naata jodgaye kaa isse behatar tarika kya ho saktaa tha ki apni galati maan len or maafee maangen
 Sowon Lal Dutta Gupta, a former professor of political science at Calcutta University, sees this as an attempt to change the image
 ve kehete hai, ''mamata na keval khud ko logon kaa paisa luutane vaale trinmul ke netaaon se alag karne kii koshish kar rahi hai balki khud ko bhrashtachar virdohi yoddha ke taur par bhi pesh kar rahi hai jo apni party ke logon par bhi kadi karrwai karne se nahin hichakengi
 Action has also taken place
 malda jile main ratua main mahanandatala ke gram pramukh sukesh jadav ko shauchalayon ke liye sweekrut fund main dhaandhlee karke ek karod rupye batorne ke aarope main girakrataar kiya gaya he
 a Trinamool leader said, "we have put 18 people behind the teachings
 ab tak mili sabhi 1,200 shikayaton main police or aarthik aparaadh shakha kii ore se karrwai kii gai he
 Taking advantage of the fire that is spreading, the BJP has allegedly organized sabotage and protests in the houses and offices of Trinamool officials in Birbhum, Bardhaman, Nadia, West Midnapore, Cooch Behar, Bankura and Kolkata districts and cut Money has been demanded to be refunded
 saikadon trinmul padaadhikari apane ilaake se bhaag gaye hai, anek ne likhit main vachan diya he ki ve cat mani waapas karenge
 The situation is getting out of hand due to protests and violence in many areas

 There are allegations of taking bribe
 unhone daawa kiya he ki cat-mani kaa hissaa party ke sheersh netaaon tak pahunchataa he
 She says, "didi has put our lives in danger by trying to prove herself to be the most honest and dishonest of all others before the world
" ''rajya sarkaar ne atirikt police mahanideshak (kanoon or vyavastha) gyanavant singh ko nirdesh diya he ki ve rishwat lene waalon ke khilaaf bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 409 ke tahat cese darj karaaen
 The police has also been instructed to act vigorously on those trying to break the law and order situation
 hatora panchayat ke derpur gaanv main pradarshnakariyon par police karrwai main kathith taur par mahilaon or bacchon ko bhi nahin bakhsha gaya
 When the party's image was seen to be deteriorating, senior Trinamool minister Partha Chatterjee announced that most of the leaders who have left Trinamool and have moved to other parties have been involved in such mess
 unhone kaha, ''ek yaa do maamle hi sahi hai
 In most cases, BJP workers are making false accusations against Trinamool workers and leaders for paying their political accounts
 ''trinmul ko ummid he ki cat mani lautaane kaa mamata kaa jumala masterstroke sabit hoga kyonki usase unki chhavi ek aise netaa kii banegi jo aam janata ko prabhavit karne vaale sookshm str tak ke bhrashtachar se ladgaye ko patibaddh he lekin philhal to party kii chhavi ko nuksaan pahunchaa he
 The BJP has left no stone unturned to capitalize on this chance of attack on Trinamool, but who actually benefited from it, it will be known later

 unhone bataaya ki bank nayaa lone dene ko raji nahin hai or ye saafe kar chuke hai ki pichley saal kaa lone chukaane ke baad hi nayaa lone sanction karenge

 narsingh raav ko kissagoi kaa sahaara lenaa padaa or phir bhi unka upanyaas vahiin khatm ho gaya jahaan unke shagird ne pradhanmantri kii kursi sanbhali
 Arjun Singh's memoirs were published posthumously and before that his family had made a suitable reshuffle to minimize the injury to the country's first family
 83 varsh ke kunwar natwar singh bhi baghawat karenge is par kisi ko yakeen nahin ho saktaa
 Natwar Singh, who stuck Nehruism to his chest, has spent 31 years in the Indian Foreign Service and 24 years in the Congress and still remembers his old-time friend Sonia very fondly
 ve bataate hai ki kaise sonia ke saath kitabon (sonia ne 1988 main unhen gabriel garsia markege kii pustak van handered iers of solitude padhgaye ko kaha), logon (sonia ne unhen aisi baaten bataayin jinhen priyanka or rahul ko bhi nahin bataaya tha) par charchaa karte hue ghanton bitaye or rajnatik gapshap bhi kii (unhone monica levinsky ke saath bill clinton ke prem prasang par bhi baat kii thi)
 Natwar Singh says, “she used to send me jokes on paper during the royal banquets
 ” natwar singh ne ghanton sonia ke bhaashan taiyaar karne main unke saath bitaye, unke saath videsh yatraaen kin or kai samvedansheel kaam bhi kiye jaise pradhanmantri pad ke liye unki pasand manmohan singh ke naam par congress ke netaaon ko raji karaayaa
 So when Natwar Singh decided to put everything in his new book One Life Is Not Enough, then you can understand why Sonia is restless and as Natwar Singh repeatedly says, why Sonia has accompanied her daughter Priyanka Going to his residence at Jorbagh, he refused to get this book published
 kya sonia kii najar main yah kitaab apni taraf dhyaan khinchne kii koshish he? yaa anaaj ke badale tel ghotaale main volkar report aane ke baad akelaa chhod die jane kaa pratishodh he?sonia ke virodhiyon ke liye to yah bahut garam masala he
 Natwar has revealed startling differences in his book
 ve likhte hai ki sonia ne pradhanmantri banane se isliye inkaar kiya kyonki rahul ne chetaya tha ki agar aisa kiya to “apni maa ko rokane ke liye kuch bhi kar guzrenge
 "natwar writes in this book that Rahul gave his mother 24 hours to change her decision
" is chetavanee ne unhen rulaa diya
 The prime ministerial contender in the last election, Rahul has a dilemma about power, which is not a good sign for the broken morale of the Congress
 isse party ke turup ke taur par rahul kii saakh ko batta hi lagegaa
 Natwar Singh also reveals that Sonia had some scandal in almost every major ministry including her ministry
 india today ke saath baatcheet main natwar singh ne kaha ki purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke media salaahkaar rah chuke sanjay baru ne apni kitaab, da accidental primaministarru da mekking and anameking of manmohan singh main sahi likhaa he ki sabhi filein sonia kii manjuuri ke liye bheji jaati thim
 Natwar Singh has told how both Sonia Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh were sleepless
 raav ne to unase shikaayat bhi kii thi ki sonia kii berukhi kaa asar unki sehat par pad rahaa he
 In 2004, Manmohan Singh called Natwar in his suite at a hotel in Bangkok and told him how lonely he was
 tab unhen pradhanmantri bane ek maheenaa hua tha
 This autobiography of Natwar Singh is as much a depiction of an all-powerful leader of the country so far
 natwar singh ne vistaar se bataaya he ki kis tarah sahami, ghabaraai, sharmili sonia ek mahatvakankshi, adhinayakawadi or kadak netaa baniin
 She never forgets or forgives anyone
 natwar singh ne unhen saamaajik-rajnatik sudhaar virdohi qaraar diya he
 Natwar Singh calls Sonia as arrogant, short-tempered, trickster, prima donna and calls her behavior poisonous and sly
 natwar kii najar main sonia kii pasand-naapsand bahut pakki he
 She never forgets a mistake nor forgives criticism
 chaahe jairam ramesh ne had paar kii ho yaa arjuna singh ne unhen apni mandali se ghira hua bataaya ho
 No one is spared, even if it is Kenneth Kaunda, the old association of his mother-in-law
 kaunda ne puraane dost divangat lalit suri ke saath thaharne kii baari bhul kar di thi
 Natwar will never reveal the reason for Sonia's displeasure with Suri
 unka kahana he ki, “aise logon kii fehrist lambii he jinaki sonia se anban ho gai
 "ultimately, the whole thing is reduced to the oil scam in lieu of food grains
 natwar singh kaa maananaa he ki unhen is maamle main bali kaa bakra banaaya gaya
 He has written that Justice R
 es
 The Pathak Committee considered him innocent
 lekin kaise yah sach aaj tak saamne nahin aayaa ki paisa aakhir kiske paas gaya
 Natwar Singh has told that Virender Dayal, former Under Secretary General of the United Nations, had brought 70,000 pages of documents and submitted them to the Enforcement Directorate but no one knows what happened to them
 natwar ne jab justise pathak se poocha ki unki padtaal kyon nahin kii gai to jawaab mila, “yah kahani lambii he
 Natwar believes that it was only at Sonia's behest that the blame was laid on her head
 ve kehete hai, “congress main unki jaankaree ke bina ek patta bhi nahin hilta
 "but the most befitting attack on Sonia by Natwar has faded in front of her
 ve likhte hai ki koi bhartiya kabhi aisa aacharan nahin kar saktaa jaisaa sonia ne kiya
 He says that Sonia has a mindless corner in her mind, which is evident from her style of throwing people out of her life without feeling emotionless
 natwar ne india today ko bataaya, “wein 19 saal kii thim, tab se bharat main hai
 They have drunk and drank everything in India, never made any mistake
 phir bhi unke vyaktitv kaa 25 pratishat hissaa kabhi nahin badal saktaa
 "all these things will make the BJP very happy
 ve yah acchhee tarah jaanate hai, phir bhi chunauti dete hai ki congress kaa koi netaa ise bijepi kii sajeesh bataakar to dekhe
 It is another matter that his son Jagat Singh is a BJP MLA from Gopalgarh in Rajasthan and the book ends with Natwar Singh meeting to advise Prime Minister Narendra Modi on foreign policy
 is pustak main aisa or bhi bahut kuch he jisase nehru-gandhi parivaar ke aalochakon ko masala milegaa
 Nehru's loyalist Natwar Singh, along with Edwina Mountbatten's love affair with the first prime minister, also wrote that Nehru in his letters told several government secrets to Edbina
 natwar singh kii najar main rajeev gandhi “sabase sundar insaan the lekin apni mandali par bharosa karne kii bhul karte the jisase unke saathi arun singh ne pradhanmantri ko suchit kiye bina general ke
 Together with Sundarji, India and Pakistan were brought to the brink of war
 ” natwar singh kii aalochana se sirf indira gandhi mukt hai
 Natwar Singh has shown the courage to rise from the place where every Congressman sits without bowing his head without question
 behad kamjor ho chuki congress main kya koi or aisa karegaa?natwar singh kii pustak ke anshaindira gandhi ne 1967 ke antim dinon main ek din mujhase kaha, “natwar koi or tumhen bataae usase pehle main bataa rahi hum ki rajeev shaadi kar rahe hai
 "I asked," Who's the lucky girl? "" It's Italian

 "when is the wedding?" Indira Gandhi said, "in February
 ”yah vaaki bahut badi khabar thi
 At that time, Rajiv was the most loved bachelor in the country, a lord of beautiful and very attractive personality
sonia, do saal choti sonia na sirf desh main sabase prasiddh rajnatik parivaar ke sadsy se vivaah kar rahi thim balki unka vivaah nehru-gandhi parivaar naam kii ek sanstha se ho rahaa tha
 There have been many slanderous rumors about Rajiv earlier, but the news of Rajiv's marriage to Edwig Antonia Albina Maino came to an end with all the rumors coming to an end
 25 farvari, 1968 ko vivaah sampann hua
 The next day, Mrs
 Gandhi hosted a wedding for Rajiv and Sonia at Hyderabad House
 sabaki nazren vadhoo par thim
 i still remember how nervous Sonia was
 turin se nai dilli tak kaa faasla bahut bada tha
 The daughter of a staunch Roman Catholic family had come into a completely stranger environment
 saanskrithik badlaav kaa jhatka hilaa dene vaala tha
 Sonia had no friend in India, nor had any understanding or knowledge of Indian languages, culture, customs, traditions, heritage, history and religion
 ve bas rajeev ke liye apane prem or apane liye rajeev ke prem se bandhi thim
 Sonia once told me that there has never been another man in her life
 rajeev or ve shaadi karne ke liye sari duniya se lard sakate the
 The couple was wooing everyone
 sabaki najaron main chadh rahaa tha
 Beautiful Rajiv and Sonia immersed in her decency
 sonia ke jivan ko chaar charnon main baanta ja saktaa he
 The first phase was a period of learning under the patronage of matrimonial pleasures, love, fun and world-famous mother-in-law
 sonia saubhaahgya kii chhaanv main shaan se chalati raheen
 The era came to an abrupt end on October 31, 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her own security men

 The second phase was just 7 years old
 congress kaaryakarini ne prastaav paarit kar rajeev ko apni maa kaa uttaradhikari chunaa
 Sonia fought him like a tigress to prevent him from becoming prime minister
 sonia ko dar tha ki rajeev kii bhi hatya ho jaaegi
 But his duty was before Rajiv, the importance of private life became smaller in front of him
 sonia ke beparwaah, bindaas din khatm ho chuke the
 She became the Prime Minister's wife and accompanied her husband around the world on government visits
 ab rajeev or sonia jindagi ko dur se nahin dekh sakate the
 He was at the center of political turmoil
 sonia kabhi behad alag-thalag dikhti thim
 But she was deeply immersed in this life
 shuru-shuru main ve ajanabiyon ke saath sahaj nahin ho paati thim or bahut kam bolti thim
 At that time hardly anyone could have seen him talking warmly with the leader of any country
 is charan ne bhi adhik din tak unhen sukh nahin diya
 Rajiv Gandhi also succumbed to Honi
 21 may,1991 ko sonia kaa sansar lut gaya jab tamilnadu ke shreeperumbudur main rajeev gandhi kii hatya ho gai
 Sonia's life is deserted
 “shankaradayal sharma ne kaha, meri umr pradhanmantri banane laayak nahin”antim sanskaar ke baad rajnatik gatividhiyaan teji se ghumin
 Those who wanted the post of president of the Congress included Arjun Singh, Narayan Dutt Tiwari, Sharad Pawar and Madhavrao Scindia
 sonia gandhi se jab pad sanbhaalane ko kaha gaya to unhone inkaar kar diya
 i asked him to now state his choice for the post
 ve jise chunegi vahi pradhanmantri banegaa
 i drank them for such a big decision
 en
 Suggested taking advice from Haksar
 is bich, unhone maakhanlaal photedaar sahit kai logon se baat kii
 The next day Sonia asked me to bring Haksar to 10 Janpath
 haksar ne salaah di ki uparashtrapati shankaradayal sharma ke saamne party adhyaksh banane kii peshkash rakhi jaae
 He suggested that Aruna Asaf Ali and i talk to the Vice President
 desh main aruna asaf ali kaa kad bahut bada tha
 He played a big role in the Quit India Movement of 1942
 ve shankaradayal sharma ko bahut acchhee tarah jaanati thim
 i was also familiar with Shankardayalji for decades
 unase meri pehali mulaakaat tab hui thi jab ve bhopal main mukhyamantri the
 The relationship between us was also connected with Cambridge University
 donon hi usase jude rahe hai
 Aruna Asaf Ali conveyed Sonia's message to the Vice President
 unhone dhiraj se sari baat suni phir bole ki sonia ji kaa itnaa vishwaas dekhakar main bahut sammanit or bhavuk hum
 After that, Aruna ji and i were shocked by what i heard
 uparashtrapati ne kaha, “bharat ke pradhanmantri kaa kaam 24 ghante kaa he
 My age and health will not let me do justice to the responsibilities of the most important post in the country
 aap sonia ji ko bataa den ki itani badi jimmedaari na uthaa paane ke mere kaaran kya he
 After listening to the Vice President's refusal, i drank Sonia again

 "sonia did not like Narasimha Rao very much" The third phase ran from 1991 to 1998
 sonia rajeev kii smritiyon ko jinda rakhkar akele main jiti raheen
 All attempts to get him into politics were turned down
 is bare main sabase buland saarvajanik apil talkatoraa garden main eisisi kii baithak main hui
 When Sonia arrived there, everyone stood up and the whole stadium echoed with the slogan "sonia-sonia"
 unase manch par baithne kaa aagrah kiya ja rahaa tha
 Applause for 10 minutes was not taking the name of stoppage
 congress kaaryakarini kii ek sadsy ne unke paas jaakar anurodh kiya ki ve manch par aaen
 But Sonia clearly stated that if this exhibition was not stopped immediately, she would get up from there
 us dauraan sonia ne rajeev gandhi foundation kii sthapana kii or rajeev ke bare main do shandaar sanskaran prakashit kiye, jinamein ve teen varshon main adhiktar samay vyast raheen
 Sonia also took over the presidency of Nehru Memorial Fund and Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust and held six international conferences in Delhi, to which we invited well-known scholars, artists and politicians
 maine suzav diya ki sonia desh ke vibhinn hisson main aise hi sammelan yojit karen
 The enthusiasm of media, intellectuals and universities in every city was worth seeing
 sonia sahaj hi mukhya aakarshan thim
 The more she stayed away from the media, the more the media followed her

 Narasimha Rao was made the Prime Minister but did not like him much
 meraa bhi unase manmutav ho gaya or main tiwari congress main shaamil ho gaya tha par baad main ham phir ek ho gaye
 i suggested that they (rao) talk to Mohammad Yunus who was in touch with Sonia

 He was the nephew of freedom fighter Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan
 kuch din baad raat 9 baje ke baad narsingh raav apane laav-lashkar yaa police kii gadipoon ke bina younus ke ghar pahunche

 But it did not happen

 "meetings with Sonia used to be very painful" The fourth phase of Sonia Gandhi's life began on March 14, 1998, when she took over as Congress President at a special meeting of the Congress Executive at Siri Fort Auditorium in New Delhi
 ve na acchhee vaktaa thim, na samvaad main maahir thim jabaki itane bade rajaneta ke liye ye donon kaushal anivaary hai
 It took many hours of trouble to prepare his first speech
 ve priyanka ke saath siri fort pahunchin or mujhe bulaakar kaha ki bagal main baith jaao
 Jairam Ramesh was also called to add some more color to the speech
 haalanki ghabrahat ke baavjood sonia pehali baadha aaraam se paar kar gayi
 i remember how hard and six to eight hours it took to prepare each speech of Sonia
 kabhi-kabhi to ksht bhari bhaashan baithken aadhi raat tak chalati thim
 Sometimes he and i worked on speech alone
 ve jor-jor se bhaashan padhati thim or main samay dekhtaa tha
 Then it was translated into Hindi
 hindi anuwaad ko phir roman aksharon main likhaa jaataa tha or mote aksharon main chapa jaataa tha
 This situation did not last long
 angreji main to ve kareeb-kareeb nipun hai
 The problem is in Hindi
 ve likhit bhaashan dekhe bina hindi nahin bol saktin
 i suggested that they chant a couple of tulsidas or Kabir's couplets and speak in the speech
 unhone haath khadey kar die, “main to likhaa hua padhgaye main hi pareshaan ho jaati hum
 Are you asking to speak without reading? forget it
 ”congress ke kai bade netaaon ne apane suzav or bhaashanon ke masaude bheje jo shaayad hi kabhi istemaal hue
 Jairam Ramesh Bilanaga used to be present in long meetings to prepare speeches
 computer par unki jaaduugari kaam aati thi
 They are good companions
 unka dimag behad painaa he par unka mazaakia swabhaav kabhi-kabhi pareshaani main daal detaa tha
 Sometimes i used to fall prey to their joke and Sonia used to enjoy my restlessness
 tab tak main sonia se akasar milane laga tha
 i reminded him that his family has many international friends who have been neglected since Rajiv's death
 in sambandhon ko phir se jaagrit karnaa chahie or unase sampark kaayam karnaa chahie
 He asked how to do it
 maine bataaya ki videsh mantralay main apane puraane saathiyon kii madad se main yah intjaam karaata hum ki bharat aane vaale videsh mantri or pradhanmantri unase milane aaen
 After all, as Congress President, she was also the leader of the opposition in a sense
 maine is bare main apane dost brajesh mishra se baat kii
 He did not refuse but did not promise
 kuch maheene baad videsh mantralay duusare deshon ke videsh mantriyon or pradhanmantriyon kii yatra ke kaaryakramon main congress adhyaksh se mulaakaat ko bhi shaamil karne laga
 Earlier Sonia was not keen on these meetings
 unka sawaal hota tha, “main unase kya kahuungi?” meri salaah hoti thi, “suniye, aapako bahut sari jaankaree milegi
 “I was present in most of these meetings between 1999 and 2005
 mehmaan ke aane se kuch minute pehle 10 janpath pahunch jaataa tha
 In the beginning, Sonia used to turn towards me, which caused me a great shock
 is par sabaki najar padi
 i told them to refrain from doing so
 dhire-dhire in mehmaanon ke saath sonia kii baatcheet main media kii dilchaspee badaae lagi
 Sonia used to care a lot about the safety of Priyanka and her children
 maine brajesh mishra se baat karne kaa vaada kiya or baad main unase baat bhi kii
 He had assured to make necessary arrangements quietly as per Sonia's wish
 sonia se meri badhati najdiki bhi chhipi nahin rahi
 i started going to 10 Janpath almost daily
 log mujhe sonia ke darbar ke sabase vishwast logon main ginaney lage or kuch shubhachintakon ne to josh dilaayaa, “aap unke sabase achche sankatmochan hai
 My answer was, "nonsense" political discussion between Sonia and me was on a very different, serious and concrete issue
 haalanki anaupchaarik baatcheet or gapshap bahut dilachasp hua karti thi
 Once i returned from my foreign trip, his first words were, "I missed you
 ”sonia ab logon ke saamne kam jhijakne lagi thim par abhi bahut faasla tay karnaa baaki tha
 Even in executive meetings, she spoke very little and seemed rude
 “sonia ne kaunda ko lalit suri kaa hotel chhodie par majaboor kiya”bharat kii swadhinata ke 50 varsh puure hone par 15 agast, 1997 ko indira gandhi smarak trust ne ek antarrashtriya sammelan kaa aayojan kiya or jambia ke purv raashtrapati kenneth kaunda ko aamantrit kiya
 In previous years, all guests were accommodated in Lalit Suri's hotel on Barakhamba Road
 1997 ke sammelan main sonia ne faisla kiya ki mehmaan oberoi hotel main thahrenge
 Kaunda arrives a day later and arrives at Suri's hotel directly from the airport
 maine sonia ko unke aane or suri ke hotel main thaharne kii soochna di
 Sonia was enraged and asked me to meet Kaunda and request her to stay in Oberoi
 saaf taur par yah maang anuchit thi
 i knew Kaunda for many years, but my work was not easy at all
 maine kaunda ko jab is bare main bataaya to unhone kaha ki ab ve vahaan thahar gaye hai or lambii udaan ke baad aaraam karnaa chaahate hai
 i gave Sonia the message of Kaunda
 maamla vahiin khatm ho janaa chahie tha, par nahin hua
 Arrogance has come to dominate
 sonia ne mujhase kaha ki kaunda ke paas waapas jaao or unase oberoi main thaharne ke liye phir aagrah karo
 i explained a lot but they did not listen to me
 maine unase yahaan tak kah diya ki unki yah jidd kisi bhi myne main sahi nahin he
 Kaunda was one of Africa's most respected and admired leaders
 ve sonia se 22 saal bade the
 Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi never used to treat anyone like this
 doosraa sandesh sunne ke baad kaunda ne kaha ki unki sthiti badi vicitra ho jaaegi
 He used to say, "what shall i say to Suri
" ” kaunda meri haalat bhaanp gaye
 i told that now the relationship is not good
 kaunda suri se kshamaa yachana ke baad hotel badalane par sahamat ho gaye
 Sonia was deliberately showing eccentricity
 yah unhen shobhaa nahin detaa tha
 The incident with Kaunda was indecent
 “272 ke samarthan kii gafalat ke baad koi or nahin batch paata”1998 main sonia ne tay kiya ki ab loksabhaa main unke pravesh kaa samay aa gaya he
 She was elected with an overwhelming majority from Amethi, the family seat
 iske baad congress sansadeey dal kaa netaa chunaa janaa swaabhaavik tha
 But she did not speak in the Lok Sabha even once in her first term
 asal main congress adhyaksh banane ke baad sonia ne do badi bhul kin

 Narayanan's sensible secretary Gopalakrishna Gandhi got a call
 ve chaahate the ki main sonia gandhi se milakar anurodh karun ki dharmanirpeksh sarkaar banane ke liye pradhanmantri ke taur par ve jyoti basu kaa samarthan karen
 i reached 10 Janpath to say this
 unki study or sammelan kaksh main kadam rakhte hi maine dekha ki pranab mukherjee, arjuna singh or maakhanlaal photedaar vahaan pehle se unke saath the
 After saying my point, i felt that all three were against Jyoti Basu and Sonia was leaning towards him
 meraa maananaa tha ki jyoti basu apane se pehle ke do pradhanmantriyon se kai myanon main behatar honge
 Eventually, the Politburo of the Communist Party of Marxist party made our problem easy by not allowing Jyoti Babu to become Prime Minister
 baad main bhale hi ve apni bhul par pachhataaye or use aitihaasik bhul kii sangya di gai
 The second wrong decision was made in the last week of April, 1999
 rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan ke netaa atal bihari vaajepayi jab sarkaar nahin bana paae to jabardast rajnatik uthaa-patake kaa daur chalaa
 The Congress staked claim to form the government with the support of other opposition parties
 arjuna singh or duusare netaaon ke kehane par sonia raashtrapati narayanan se milin or 272 saansadon ke samarthan kaa daawa pesh kar diya
 Narayanan gave two days to prove his majority
 lekin ain maukey par samarthan kaa bharosa dilaa chuke samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav palati maar gaye or congress ke pairon tale se jameen khinch lee
 The Lok Sabha was dissolved on 26 April 1999
 sonia buree tarah sharminda huin
 By that time, she was a novice in the arena of politics and did not know what a bloody game it was
 congress kaa koi or netaa hota to aisi gafalat ke baad daravaaje ke baahar khadaa hota
 "vajpayee immediately provided security to Sonia in New York" Between 2000 and 2003, Sonia went to the United States and met celebrities such as Vice President Dick Cheney and Foreign Minister Kodolija Rice
 ve oxford or honkong bhi gayi
 i was with him
 videsh main unka vyaktitv ekadam badal jaataa tha
 Women used to be straightforward, comfortable, stress free, more caring for others and less stubborn
 neuyork kii ek ghatana aisi hui jiskaa zikr karnaa yahaan munasib he
 Sonia and members of her delegation — Manmohan Singh, Murali Deora, Jairam Ramesh and i — stayed at the Carlile Hotel
 vahaan ham shaam ko der se pahunche the
 Arriving there, i came to know that the New York authorities had not made any security arrangements for Sonia
 main hairaan rah gaya
 Anyone could go to his room
 sonia ne ise nazarandaaj kiya par maine turant pradhanmantri vaajapeyi ko phone kiya
 It was midnight at that time in Delhi
 bade dil vaale vaajapeyi ne kaha ki ve abhi phone karenge
 About half an hour later, our ambassador in Washington, Lalit Mansingh, got a call
 unhone bataaya ki abhi-abhi pradhanmantri kaa phone aayaa tha or mujhase turant sonia gandhi ke liye suraksha intjaam karne ko kaha gaya he
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee was firm in his words
 “raajnneeti ne sonia kii khaal moti kar di”janata main sonia kii chhavi bahut aakarshak nahin he or iske liye ek had tak ve swayan jimmedaar hai
 She does not read her mind to anyone, does not get out of her realm

 People are surprised to see them, not appreciative
