 Writer Juhi Chaturvedi, who came to the limelight by writing different films like Vicky Donor, Piku and October, told for the first time on the platform of Sahitya Aaj Tak that despite being a writer, she wrote stories of many popular films
 'aao film likhe' seshan main said ansaari ke saath baatcheet ke dauraan juhi ne kaha, "maine kabhi lekhika banane ke bare main nahin sochaa tha
 i reached Delhi from Lucknow while working and then came to Mumbai
 mujhe yun hi filmon ke lekhan kaa kaam mil gaya
 "juhi said," i was in Lucknow and i used to go to Arts College
 tab itnaa tha ki times of india ke liye elestration kiya karti thi
 Some thought, used to write
 kabhi film lekhan ke bare main sochaa hi nahin tha
 "sahitya Aaj Tak: Juhi Chaturvedi's class, told- how to write film" went to Lucknow twice or four times in a year and saw films
 doston ke saath film dekhne kii koi baat hi nahin thi
 i was not concerned with films
 mere dada acchhee baaten karte the ghar main
 She used to keep hearing such things in her ears
 kahin na kahin wo kaan main ja rahaa tha
 "" a lot of people will be here who will be from places like Lucknow, Rae Bareli
 hamaare aas-paas aise log hai jinke saath hamaara bahut kuubasurat rishta he
 Probably came to Delhi on the pretext of avoiding marriage and job
 filmon se koi rishta nahin tha
 Bombay shifted as ed
 shujit sarkaar ne jab mujhe apni filmon ke liye samvaad likhane ko bolaa
 i worked with him a lot for Ed
 unhen mujh par bharosa tha ki main likh paaungi
 "" Whether it's Ed or film, it all depends on whether you have something to say
 kya aap wo bhav utaar sakate hai
 Are you an emotional person or not
 kya wo chijen aapako andar tak chooti hai yaa nahin
 i hadn't thought of becoming a writer, but i had words, ideas, stories

 ye rosemara kii jindagi se judi he
 There is something deep in it
 wo baat jo shaayad bahut saare logon par lagu hoti he, par jise nazarandaaj kar dete hai
 "" i had a lot of thoughts on Vicky Donor's story
 jab maine ise sunaaya to kehane ko shabd zyada nahin the
 i told that there is a man who donates sperm around the world, but cannot have children of his own
 maine itnaa hi sunaaya, lekin dimag main bahut kuch tha
 When i worked on that idea, Vicky Donor's story was made
 "piku main amitabh kii maut kaa seen likh roi thim riter, 10 din rahaa sadma"maine piku or viki donor se pehle aisa koi bada kaam nahin kiya tha
 i had no previous job, so the courage was complete
 maine kisi ko bataaya bhi nahin tha ki main film likh rahi hum
 i think that when Vimal Roy made two bighas of land or Satyajit Roy and all the directors made such films, i think that there have been many courageous people before me
 ""unako guru maanakar kamare main baithkar akele darate-darate likh liya
 It takes courage to engage in it

 " This is Prime Minister Narendra Modi's fifth address from the ramparts of the Red Fort and this is the last address of the current Modi government
 desh chaar saal se zyaada samyavadhi kaa unka kaarykaal dekh chukaa he or isse pehle chaar baar bataur pradhanmantri wo bharat kii janata ko laal kile ke pracheer se sambodhit kar chuke hai
 In the first year i
e
 in 2014, when the Prime Minister along with his first non-congress majority government stood at this fort to address the country on the day of independence, there was a vision in it
 yah drushti thi unki sankalpana ke bharat kii or un vaadon ke kriyanvayan kii jo unhone logon se chunaav prachaar ke dauraan kiye the
 In this speech, he hinted at taking the country forward in a different way and bringing about an aggressive change
 baad ke bhaashanon main wo vipaksh par prahaar karte, apane kaamkaaj ko ginate or logon ko sidhe prabhavit karne vaale muddon par bolte nazar aae
 This has rarely happened during the tenure of Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he did not appear in the election campaign posture

 Elections of the states in the country continued to appear and the style and content of their speeches kept coming in front of people
 ise padhein

 He told Aaj Tak, “this year is to tell the country about its achievements
 isaki jhalak 15 agast ko dekhne ko milegi
 This speech of Modi ji will prove to be an invocation of the election campaign and from here the tone of the election campaign will be set
 ”visheshgyon kaa maananaa he kipradhanmantrica is varsh kaa sambodhan apni uplabdhiyon ko ginane se lekar nae kaam or kaaryakramon kaa lekhajokha hoga
 At the same time, he can also indicate to the country that if people have to take this development forward, then their return in the upcoming elections is the only option
 yahaan padhein, raashtrapati kaa puraa bhaashan
 
 
 Independence Day: President Kovind said - There is no place of violence in Gandhi's country, so all the speeches of the Prime Minister are in the eyes of the nation, but the address of the country from the Red Fort is the most watched by the people
 pradhanmantri is avasar ke mahatv ko jaanate hai or uske anurup hi apni kathavstu logon ke saamne rakhte rahe hai
 Right after the monsoon session and address this time, the country has to watch assembly elections in four states and after those elections the country will be listening to the political campaign for general elections
 aise main pradhanmantri ke liye unki vartmaan sarkaar kaa antim sambodhan desh ko sandesh hone ke saath saath ek chunavi or raajnneetik avasar bhi he jise apane paksh main istemaal karnaa wo bakhubi jaanate hai
 Speaking in the Rajya Sabha on the issue of inflation and increase in rail fares, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that the government is taking all steps to control inflation
 unka kahana he ki congress party ke kaamon kii vajah se railway kii haalat kaaphi kharaab ho gai thi, railway board ne antarim bajet se pehle sarkaar se sampark saadhaa or kiraayon main badhotaree kii maang kii
 Jaitley says that the railway was incurring a loss of 30 thousand crores, which needed to be replenished
 railway board kii kiraye or bhaade main vruddhi kii maang ko maanate hue farvari main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne sweekaar kiya, lekin unhone chunaav parinaam aane tak rukne ko kaha tha
 Jaitley said that according to this order, the Railways increased the fare as soon as the election results came
 jetali ne sadan ko yah bhi bataaya ki 16 may ko parinaam aane ke baad tatkaaleen railmantri ne railway board se yah kah diya ki ab yah aadesh waapas liya jaataa he or ab nai sarkaar yah tay karegi
 Jaitley told the House that the fare it has increased, it is the account of Congress and what will be the fare of nda's tenure, it will be known in tomorrow (railway Budget)
 petrol or dijal ke daamon par charchaa karte hue jetali ne kaha ki petrol or dijal ke daamon main vruddhi bhi congress kii dein he
 He said that the Congress party made a rule to increase the price of diesel by 50 paise every month
 chunaav ke do maah purv sarkaar ne companiyon ko yah nahin karne diya
 And then as soon as the election results came, the companies increased the price by one rupee
 petrol kii keemten antarrashtriya daamon main ai teji kii vajah se badi hai
 Speaking on the issue of food grains, Finance Minister Jaitley said that prices have been increasing every year during this period
 aalu-pyaaj kii keemton par shor ho rahaa he, lekin is baar sarkaar ne keemten badhane ke saath hi karrwai kii or keemten pichley varsh tak jahaan 70-100 rupee tak pahunchi thi, vahiin is baar 15-25 rupee kii bich hi raheen
 Jaitley also informed the House about the steps taken in this matter
 unhone bataaya kii sarkaar ne daam ko niyantrit karne ke kai upaay kiye or philhal kaamyaab hui he
 He said that onion and potato prices have not gone above Rs 25 per kg
 baluchistan ke panjagur main guuruuvaar ko aatankwaadi hamale main pakistani mantri bal-bal batch gaye
 a senior police officer told Dawn News that Balochistan Health Minister Rehmat Saleh was attacked by a Baloch convoy when he was coming to prom from Panjgur
 is haadase main balooch or unke sahyogiyon ko koi chot nahin pahunchi he
 The official said the militants attacked with multiple weapons, including rockets
 iske baad aatankwaadi bachakar bhaag nikalne main kaamyaab rahe
 So far no terrorist organization has claimed responsibility for this attack
 tippaniyan (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) There is no injury to Baloch and his associates in this accident
 adhikari ne bataaya ki aatankwaadiyon ne rocket sahit kai hathiyaaron se hamalaa kiya
 After this, the terrorists managed to escape
 abhi tak kisi bhi aatankwaadi sanghathan ne is hamale kii jimmedaari nahin lee he
 The comments (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) He agreed with the Congress allegations, saying, 'prime Minister Narendra Modi was busy shooting a film in Corbett National Park during the Pulwama attack
 aatanki hamale kii khabaren aane ke baad bhi unki shooting jari rahi
 The MNS chief said that 40 soldiers who were martyred in the Pulwama attack became 'political victims' and every government coined such things, but this is happening frequently under Modi's rule
 vahiin, pradesh bhaajapa pravaktaa madhav bhandari ne kaha, ‘raaj thakare apane puure kariyar main nakal utaarte rahe hai
 Now he has been emulating Rahul Gandhi by making allegations against Doval
 'bataa den, jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main jaish-e-mohammad ke aatankiyon ne siarpief ke kafile par hamalaa kar diya tha
 40 soldiers were killed in the attack and around five soldiers were injured
 iske baad congress ne piem modi par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 Targeting PM Modi, the Congress had said that PM Modi was shooting for the film in National Corbett Park even after getting information about the Pulwama attack
 haalanki, baad main sarkaar ke sutron ke hawaale se khabar ai thi ki piem modi hamale kii jaankaree deree se mili thi
 Usually, the matter of cheating is seen by associating with men, but it is not that only husbands cheat on their wife
 kai aise maamle hai jinamein patniyaan bhi apane pati ko dhokhaa detii hai
 a 2012 survey conducted by Marital and Family Therapy revealed that while 22 per cent of married men cheated on their wives, 14 per cent of men who cheated on their wives
 survey main ek baat yah bhi pataa chali ki jahaan purushon ke liye dhokhaa dene kii pramukh vajah shaareerik thi vahinmahilaon membhaavnaatmak
 When women do not get emotional support, they move away from their partners and join with someone else
 vaise, iske alaava or bhi vajahen hai jinke chalate mahilaayein apane patiyon ko dhokhaa dene kii baat sochati hai or detii bhi hai
 Know here -1
 jab mahilaon ko apane pati yaa bwoyfriend se vah ahmiyat or apnaapan nahin miltaa, jisaki ve ummid karti hai to unke man main kisi duusare kaa khyaal aata he
 This thought only motivates them to cheat
 2
 Many times, women take revenge on their partner as well
 agar unhen unke premi yaa pati se dhokhaa miltaa he to ve unase pratishodh lene ke liye unhen dhokhaa detii hai
 3
 kai baar shaareerik sambandhon se santusht na hone par bhi mahilaon ke man main apane pati ko dhokhaa dene kii baat aati he
 4
 kai baar aisa hota he kimahilaon ko unke purush partnerase unki shaareerik banaavat ko lekar baaten sunani padati hai
 Like your figure is not like that
 tumhaara rang dabaa hua he or bhi bahut kuch
 These things are not liked by women and they turn to other men to prove themselves
 5
 When a woman is dependent on a man, it becomes a compulsion for her to stay with her partner
 par zyaadaatar jo mahilaayein aatmanirbhar hoti hai ve apane swabhimaan ko sabase upar rakhti hai
 Whenever they see a threat to their self-esteem, they do not take time to leave the partner
 6
 Some women also leave a partner and move on because they feel bored with that person
 yah bhi sach he ki jivan main kuch nae prayog karne ke uddeshy se bhi mahilaayein, apane pati ko dhokhaa detii hai
 a few hours after the relief news of the fall in petrol and diesel prices, the Aam Aadmi Party government of Delhi has destroyed the expectations of the people

 com / h8eqkewtph— Ryan Hawaii (@ryan_hawaii)january 13, 2018 In the recently concluded first session of Parliament, the Muslim Women Bill 2017 (protection of Rights on Marriage) was the most discussed
 is bill par sansad ke donon sadanon main kareeb 12 ghante tak bahes chali
 The India Today data analysis team analyzed 39 bills introduced in Parliament and found that the second number was the National Medical Council bill that was abolished by the Indian Medical Council
 anuchhed 370 ko khatm karne vaala sabase vivaadaaspad jammu-kashmir punargathan bill mahaj 7 ghante kii bahes main hi paas ho gaya
 Surprisingly, it could not even make it to the top ten list in Rajya Sabha, let us tell you that the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Bill removing Article 370 was first introduced in Rajya Sabha itself
 sansad main kisi bhi bill par sadasyon ke bahes kaa aankada dekhen to teen talaak ko sabase zyada vakt diya gaya
 It took 11 hours 43 minutes from both houses to pass this bill
 vahiin neshnal medical council bill ko 10 ghante 54 minute die gaye
 But the shocking thing is that more than the bill removing Article 370, the Jammu and Kashmir Reservation Bill was discussed
 jammu- kashmir punargathan bill loksabhaa main 4 ghante 11 minute kii bahes ke baad paas ho gaya vahiin rajyasabha main is bill par 3 ghante 28 minute bahes hui
 The remaining controversial bills discussed 8 hours 57 minutes on the UAPA bill while the Right to Information (amendment) bill took 8 hours 6 minutes to pass
 (pichley dinon khatm hue sansad satr main teen talaak par sabase zyada bahes hui)aam aadmi party ke rajyasabha saansad sanjay singh kaa kahana he 'sarkaar ne is bill par bahes karne ke liye vipaksh ko bahut kam vakt diya
 Due to this we were not able to prepare properly, this is not the right situation for any MP
 'unhone aarope lagaaya, 'congress ko vipaksh kii aguwai kerani chahie thi lekin wo khud hi kanphyus dikhi
 Many times he felt that he is leaderless
 bill kaa virodh karne ke baavjood unhone modi sarkaar ko bill ko aasaani se paas karne diya
 (the controversial RTI bill also failed to make it to the top ten debates in the Lok Sabha), although the government has rejected the opposition's allegations
 bijepi ke pravaktaa shahanvaj hossain kehete hai 'wo ye kah nahin sakate ki bill pesh karne se pehle hamane unhen kam vakt diya
 All instructions associated with the introduction of the bill were followed
 ye modi sarkaar ki badi kamyaabi he ki hamane itane kam vakt main record sankhya main bill paas karvaa liye
 (the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Bill also failed to make it to the top ten in the Rajya Sabha debate) The PRS Legislative has released figures according to which 39 bills were introduced in this session of which 36 bills were passed in Lok Sabha and 29 bills from Rajya Sabha
 Got approval
 satr ke dauraan loksabhaa 37 dinon tak chali jabaki rajyasabha main 35 dinon tak kaamkaaj hua
 Statistics show that 281 hours worked in the Lok Sabha, which is 135% of the limit, in the last 20 years no work has been done in any session of Parliament
 pichley 20 saal main ausatan ek satr main 81% hi kaamkaaj hua
 At the same time, the Rajya Sabha ran for 195 hours, which is 100% of the limit
 pichley 20 saal main rajya kaa ausat kaamkaaj 76% hi rahaa he

 The army's claim about the incident has been questioned by a report filed by the central and state security agencies regarding the encounter of Keran sector

 The surviving terrorists tried to sneak into various areas in the same sector, such as Gujjar dor and Fatehgali, where they were surrounded and killed
 ’ The army also said that the eighth body was lying on the Line of Control and that it was difficult to lift it amidst cross-border firing
 sutron ne is baat par hairat jataai ki kya shav ko 20 kilometre se adhik kii duuri tak khinchakar niyantran rekha par le jaaya gaya
 Some reports in Pakistani media claimed that Indian Army personnel kidnapped three civilians from Neelum Valley, located near Keran Sector, two of whom were killed and one escaped

 He told that the CBI should investigate the trio with a lie-catching machine and take the charges seriously
 siddiqui ne kaha ki mukhyamantri saare vishay par pardaa daalane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 If the Chief Minister, Tiwari and Singh are innocent, they should publicly deny it, give a statement in the House and clarify their position
 rajd netaa ne kaha, ‘hamane kai baar kaary sthagan prastaav kaa notice dekar is vishay ko uthaane kaa prayaas kiya lekin vidhansabhadhyaksh ne ise khaarij kar diya

 bhrashtachar kar arabon kii sampatti jutaney ke aarope main giraftaar chandauli ke sahaayak kshetreey transport adhikari aar es yadav kii giraftaar ke baad unako lekar roj nae khulaase ho rahaa hai
 During the investigation, it is being revealed how RS Yadav laid his trap on the UP and Bihar border
 kisi bhi transporter kaa trek bina rishwat die hue uttar pradesh se bihar main yaa phir bihar se uttar pradesh main nahin aa saktaa tha
 To raise money, RS Yadav adopted the method of 'system' and 'entry'
 uski vajah se chandauli border par rojaanaa kareeb 10 lakh rupee kii ugaahi hua karti thi
 Truck owners and transporters were exempted from paying bribes through the system or the entry method
 is maamle kii tahakikat ke liye aaj tak kii team upi or bihar border par sthit chandauli pahunchi to yadav ke kai raaj saamne aae
 Going there, it was found that most truck owners or transport preferred to walk in the 'system'
 'system' kaa tarika apnaane vaale transportron ko maheene ke 1 se 7 taarikh ke bich main apane har ek trek ko border paar karaane ke liye 4000 se 5000 rupee ke bich rishwat deni hoti thi
 Each transporter used to pay according to the number of trucks
 rishwat dene ke baad ek kori diya jaataa tha, jisko dikhaakar puure maheene aasaani se border paar karte the
 Many other sensational revelations meant that another 'entry' way meant that truck drivers who do not cross the Chandauli border regularly and seldom come, do not adopt the 'system' method, rather when they are on the border
 When they used to come, they had to pay bribes ranging from 7000 to 2 xxrep 4 0 rupees for the overload truck
 aar es yadav kii giraftaar ke baad police ab usko lekar tafteesh kar rahi he, jisamen yah sansanikhej khulaasa hua he
 SP Santosh Kumar Singh, who came with several trucks, said in a conversation with Aaj Tak that he is also investigating the matter regarding this revelation
 vahiin, kuch trek waalon ne bataaya ki koi bhi trek binaarishwatadie hue border paar nahin kar saktaa tha, chaahe vah overlod ho yaa phir under lod
 Now after Yadav's arrest, many truck drivers are applying to the SSP and complaining about the manner in which they too have been bribed and beaten many times

 Deshmukh, while addressing a joint meeting of BJP, Shiv Sena and RPI (A) activists in Miraj town in Sangli district on Wednesday, allegedly said that it is not easy to win the Sangli seat
 is seat se bhaajapa ne maujuuda saansad sanjyakaaka patil ko tikat diya he
 When someone in the crowd asked Deshmukh what he would give him if Patil was elected again, he said, "you will get five lakh or more
" ''lekin unhone yah bhi kaha, ‘‘majaak chodo
 Sanjay Patil has done a great job in Miraj here by securing funds for the development work of roads, highways, railways and other infrastructure projects
 ''unke bhaashan kaa ek video clip soshal media par viral ho gaya
 Sangli District Collector Abhijeet Chaudhary said that the Election Commission has taken cognizance of the news in the media about Deshmukh's speech 
 unhone kaha, ‘‘unke bhaashan kii footage ko assistant riterning afisar ko bhej diya gaya he

 kisi bhi naukari ko paane kii pehali seedhi rigeume sellection hota he
 Only after it is selected, you are called for an interview
 yahi nahin aapke intervyuu main rigeume se jude sawaal bhi kiye jate hai
 That is why elders always advise to read their résumé before going to a job interview
 aajkal to skool collejon main rigeume ko lekar class bhi chalaai ja rahi hai jahaan students ko rigeume ko acha banane ke gur sikhaye jate hai
 If you are preparing a resume for a job and do not understand how to make it good, then follow these seven tips
 jaane videsh main padhai karnaa kaise banaata he aapako smart1
 Avoid using difficult words: Do not use difficult words in your resume
 agar aapako lagata he ki aap taff vards ko yuj kar acha impressant bana sakenge to aap galat he
 Try to use words that are commonly spoken
 agar aap kathin shabdon kaa prayog karte hai to uskaa matlab jarur jaane
 2
 font kaa khyaal rakhen:rigeume banaate vakt font kaa khaas khyaal rakhen
 Using too big or too much font can make your résumé look unsightly and also spoil the impression
 12 se 14 font sies or times new roman font standard mana jaataa he
 Fill this life in a lifeless office desk 
 
 3
 Do not give space without meaning: If you think that you will give more space in your resume, then it will look clear and clear then you are wrong
 dher sara white spes bhi aapke rigeume kaa luk kharaab kar detaa he
 Use the same space where necessary
 4
 Do not force a long resume: Sometimes we feel that if you make a 3-4 page resume, then you are wrong if you are called more talented
 kam shabdon main apni baat kehane kii koshish karen
 Longer resumes sometimes become boring, which the recruiter does not read completely and in such a way, the necessary information is also missed
 banking pariksha paas karne ke paanch tips5
 Avoid Grammatical Errors: In the résumé, grammatical mistakes are often seen, which makes your impression in front of the recruiter worse before the interview
 rigeume ko baar-baar check karen or dusron se bhi check karvaa le tabhi kahin bhejein
 Also avoid spelling mistsake
 safalataa kii bulandiyon par hai to naa karen ye kaam6
 Write the same things in the résumé about which you are confident: It is often seen that many people write things that they do not even know about themselves in order to increase the weight of the résumé
 aisi chijen likhane se bachein kyonki agar aapane jo likhaa he uski jaankaree nahin he to aap intervyuu main sharminda ho sakate hai
 7
 passport sies photo jarur lagaaein:ek idial rigeume aapke photo ke bina adhuraa he
 If you have not put a photo at the time of making the resumé, then before going to the interview, put a passport size photo in the upper left of the resume

 In fact, the question for everyone is that after Hardik Patel was given the ticket to two convenors of his own Patidar Reservation Movement Committee, why did his ticket get cut off, the senior leader of Congress as well as people belonging to other caste Working to get it done
 hardik patel ke saath rahane vaale log or sutron kii maane to hardik or congress ke bich jo deal hui he usamen hardik ne kai aise logon ke naam die hai jo saalon se congress ke saath jude hue hai ore patidaar bhi hai, isamen kuch log duusari jati ke bhi hai
 Hardik has assured the Congress that if the Congress gives tickets to these Congress Patidars, the Patidar society will bear the responsibility of winning it
 isi ranneeti ke tahat somvaar ko jabahardik patelke patidaar aarakshan andolan ke saathi or sanyojak rahe amit thumur or praphul togadiya ko congress se mili hui tikat se hataakar yahaan saalon se congress main jude patidaar netaa or junagarh main jite brahman netaa ko tikat diya gaya
 If sources are to be believed, this battle through Hardik Patel and his associates is to defeat the BJP, which ruled Gujarat for the last 22 years
 isliye hardik patel or unke samarthak congress se jite or gaiyr vivaadit logon ko hi tikat dene kii maang kar rahe hai
 The way the BJP was alleging that Hardik Patel was dealing with the Congress over the ticket for his colleagues and remained an agent of the Congress

 bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi got into trouble on Wednesday, sparking a huge controversy

 On the orders of the Election Commission, the Gujarat Police has lodged an FIR against the Chief Minister of the state for violating the model code of conduct
 police ne yah karrwai tab kii jab modi dwaara un nirvachan kanoonon ke ulanghan ko chunaav ayog ne gambhirtha se liya jinke tahat koi bhi shaks chunaav ke din na to koi chunavi maamla dikhaa saktaa he or na hi matdaan centre main kisi sabha ko sambodhit kar saktaa he
 An FIR has been lodged against Modi on the commission's order
 ayog ke aadesh ke turant baad ahmedabad main aparaadh shakha police ne modi ke khilaaf praathmiki darj kii
 An FIR has been lodged against Modi because he gave a speech showing his party's election symbol 'lotus' after casting his vote in Gandhinagar this morning

 'an FIR has been lodged against the TV channels that aired the press conference
 aparaadh shakha ke sutron ne bataaya ki chunaav ayog ke nirdesh ke mutabik janpratinidhitiv kanoon ke praavdhaanon ke tahat praathmikiyaan darj kii gai hai
 Under the sections under which the FIR has been filed, if found guilty, he can face a jail term of up to two years
 modi ne us vakt vivaad ko janm de diya jab unhone apana vot daalane ke turant baad apni party kaa 'camel' nishaan haath main dikhaakar ek samvaadadaata sammelan ko sambodhit kiya or bhaajapa ke liye khuleam vot maange
 The incident occurred at a polling station in Ranip area of ahmedabad under Gandhinagar seat
 gandhinagar seat se laalkrishna adwani bhaajapa ke ummidavaar hai
 Enraged by the incident, the Congress filed a complaint with the Election Commission accusing Modi of violating the code of conduct and demanded action with his disqualification
 anya partiyon ne bhi modi par hamalaa kiya
 The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has described Modi as a "habitual criminal"
 shikaayat milane ke turant baad harakat main aae ayog ne gujarat ke sheersh adhikariyon ko mukhyamantri modi ke khilaaf praathmiki darj karne ke aadesh die
 The order of the Election Commission in Delhi said, 'the Commission believes that on the day voting is going on in the whole of Gujarat and different parts of the country, on that day Narendra Modi by addressing the House and addressing the Assembly, Section of the Representation of People's Act, 1951 Violated 126: 1:: A: and 126: 1:: B:
 ' The order stated, 'therefore, the Commission gives instructions
 
 
 narendra modi tathaa ukt sabha ko yojit karne main shaamil rahe sabhi logon ke khilaaf shikaayat yaa praathmiki, jaisaa bhi maamla ho, darj kii jaani chahie
 ' ayog ne gujarat ke mukhya sachiv or dijipi se shaam 6 baje tak anupaalan report talab kii thi
 Amidst the attacks being carried out by opponents on Modi, BJP spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi insisted in Delhi that Modi had 'not violated the election code of conduct'
 samvaadadaata sammelan yojit nahin kiya gaya tha
 However, Lekhi said, 'election Commission is a constitutional body and we respect it
 ham uske nirnyon kaa paalan karenge
 ' dhara 126 :1: :e: or :bi: ke mutabik, matdaan sampann hone se pehle kii 48 ghante kii avadhi ke dauraan jansabhaon par pabandi hoti he
 According to this, 'no person shall (a) convene nor convene nor address any public meeting in connection with an election
 (ba) cinemetograph, televijan yaa aise hi kisi anya upkaran ke jariye bhi kisi chunavi maamle ko nahin dikhaaya jayega
 ' shaam ke samay up-chunaav ayukta vinod jutshi ne dilli main kaha ki gujarat sarkaar ne chunaav ayog ko apni anupaalan report bheji he
 The Congress immediately turned to the Election Commission and accused Modi of gross violation of the model code of conduct
 dilli main sawaalon ke jawaab dete hue bhaajapa pravaktaa minakshi lekhi ne jor dekar kaha ki modi ne 'chunaav aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan nahin kiya he
 The press conference was not held
 ' However, Lekhi said, 'the Election Commission is a constitutional body and we respect it
 ham uske adeshon kaa paalan karenge
 ' yun to vot daalane ke baad netaaon dwaara sankshipt bayaan dena ek chalan he par modi ne vot daalane ke baad ek samvaadadaata sammelan yojit kar apane raajnneetik virodhiyon ko naaraaz kar diya
 During the press conference, Modi not only appealed to the voters to vote for the BJP but also attacked the Congress
 modi ne vot kii syaahi lagi apni anguli or 'camel' kaa nishaan dikhaate hue apane mobile phone se tasviir bhi lee
 Though it is a trend to make a brief statement by the leaders after casting a vote, but Modi angered his political opponents by holding a press conference after casting his vote
 samvaadadaata sammelan ke dauraan modi ne na sirf matadaataaon se bhaajapa ke liye vot dene kii apil kii balki congress ke khilaaf bhi hamalaa bolaa
 Modi also took a picture from his mobile phone showing his finger and 'lotus' marking with the ink of the vote
 akhil bhartiya congress cameti ke vidhi prakoshth ke sachiv ke si mittal ne turant yah kehete hue chunaav ayog main shikaayat daakhil kii ki modi kaa bhaashan or chunaav chihn dikhaanaa janpratinidhitiv kanoon kii dhara 126 kaa ulanghan he
 Mittal demanded that an FIR be lodged against Modi
 party ne shikaayat main kaha, 'vibhinn news channelon par khabar ke sidhe prasaaran se yah dekha gaya ki modi apana vot daalane ke liye gandhinagar main matdaan centre par gaye
 In his complaint, the party said, "while going to the polls, he was campaigning for the BJP and giving a speech in such a way that it seemed that he was campaigning for the BJP, for himself and to cast his vote
 He later publicly showed his election symbol
 ' The Haryana government is pushing for a new sports policy on the one hand, on the other hand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is emphasizing on the 'beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Abhiyan', but there are some daughters in the state who like wheat in the fields of others for their sport

 Today, the situation is that they have to wage wages and harvest wheat in the fields of others in order to pay their sports expenses, whereas they must either be in school or in the playground

 'ladakiyon ke coach dilbagh singh ne kaha, 'inamen se paanch khilaadi neshnal level par medal jeet chuki hai or kai khilaadi pika or rajyasatreey khel pratiyogita main silver medal bhi jeet chuki hai
 Due to the economic condition of the house, they have to cut the wheat in other fields, they spend a lot on either the village panchayat members or the school staff
 inhen agar sarkaar thodi madad kare to ye international level tak bhi ja sakati hai
 These girls have good talent
 lekin saath main inhen dihadi bhi kerani padati he
 Due to this, the entire focus is not on the game

 BJP and Congress stood up against this statement
 donon ne iskaa munhtod jawaab diya or kaha ki yah bayaan nindaneey he
 On behalf of the Congress, Manish Tiwari said that the party condemns this statement
 unhone kaha ki agar vah vyakti jis par gambhir aarope hai, pakistan main rah rahaa he to vah pakistan sarkaar kii jimmedaari he ki use vah bharat ko saunpe
 BJP spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi said on the statement of Pakistan Minister Nisar Ali Khan that Modi never talked about attacking Pakistan
 ham pakistan se kahenge ki vah apane tareeke badale
 The way they are working and want to maintain relations with India, it cannot go on
 unhone kaha ki bharat pakistan ke maamalon main hastkshep nahin karata he or ummid karata he ki pakistan bhi aisa hi karegaa

 According to reports, forced Nicah campaign is being carried out in most areas of northwest Pakistan
 lekin, jab kuch mahilaon ne taliban ke is sanakee farmaan kii police main shikaayat kii to taliban kaa kaala cheharaa phir duniya ke saamne jaahir ho gaya
 a woman named Salma was told to Pakistan newspaper Dawn that the Taliban has asked people to go to mosques and proclaim this about their virgin daughters, so that they can be married
 yahi nahin, taliban ne swat ghati main ye bhi farmaan jari kiya he ki agar mahilaayein gharon ke baahar bagaiyr kisi pahchaan patr yaa bagaiyr kisi purush parijan ke pain gayi to unhen gambhir nattejey bhugatne honge
 Also, if the husband and wife also leave the house, then they have to keep the marriage proof, otherwise it can be difficult
 taliban ke is farmaan se wo log bhi pareshaan hai, jo kabhi uske sandeshon ko pasand karte the
 Why not, because this time the heat of the Taliban craze has now reached the homes of the people
 dilli se sate gurugram ke bhavani enklev main avaidh sambandhon ke chalate patni ne aashiq sang mil kar pati ko maut ke ghat utaar diya
 The incident took place at midnight between 12 and 13 June, when police received information from the control room that Arvind, a man, had died in suspicious circumstances in a house in Bhavani Enclave
 mritak arvind apni bivi anita ke saath isi colony ke ek makaan main kiraye par rahata tha
 The wife of the deceased also informed the police about this incident
 soochna milte hi police ne shav ko kabje main lekar postmortem ke liye bhej diya
 The post mortem report uncovered the dangerous plans of the murder accused i

 Anita, the wife of the deceased Arvind and his lover Rajan
 arvind ne kabhi sapane main bhi nahin sochaa hoga ki jis rajan ko wo apana jigari dost samaj kar ghar main panaah de rahaa he, vahi uski hatya kii vajah ban jayega
 Actually, both husband and wife Anita and Arvind lived in Bhavani Enclave area of sector 9 police station area
 rajan arvind kaa jigari dost tha
 Arvind had also allowed Rajan to stay in his house due to the financial constraints of the house
 iske baad se hi mritak kii patni or rajan ke bich avaidh sambandhon kaa silsilaa shuru hua
 According to the police, in the initial questioning, Anita was not ready to tell anything and kept trying to trick the police
 lekin jab police ne maamle kii sanjidagi ko dekhte hue gambhirtha se taftish shuru kii to mritak arvind ke pita ke bayaan par khulaasa hua ki 10 saal pehle arvind ne anita se prem vivaah kiya tha or tabhi se arvind ghar se alag bhavani anchlev main rahane laga tha
 When the wife of the deceased was strictly questioned, Anita admitted that she and Rajan together strangled Arvind and killed him
 vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke baad rajan vahaan se chalaa gaya, jisase police ko anita or rajan par kisi tarah kaa shaq na ho
 However, the police have arrested both the killers

 As soon as DUSU election date is announced on Tuesday, all the student organizations have started preparations at their own level

 Interestingly, FYUP is the biggest issue for all
 ise hataane kaa credit har sanghathan lenaa chahta he
 In fact, in the last few months, student organizations on campus had demonstrated fiercely against FYUP
 enesayuai ke pravaktaa ambrish pande kaa kahana he ki hamane FYUP ko hataaya he
 That is, the student organization of the same Congress government at the time when the FYUP was launched, is taking full credit to remove it, while the angry organizations have started a poster war on campus
 nateeja campus main chaaron ore poster or binar lage hai
 On the other hand, Rohit Chahal of ABVP says that the Congress which started FYUP is talking about removing it

 sanyukt raashtra kii sanstha UNCTAD ke antarrashtriya vyapaar report 2019 main mili aankadon or trend se yah pataa chalata he ki pichley kuch varshon main antarrashtriya vyapaar main pehle maamuli badhat hui (2012-14), phir isamen giravat dekhi gai (2015 or 2016) or ant main isamen acchhee majbootee ai (2017 or 2018)
 Global trade has gained momentum again due to improvement in production and investment and commodity prices
 haalanki, UNCTAD ne yah chetavanee di he ki bhavishya bahut sunaharaa nahin he, kyonki aage vaishvik utpaadan main baari badhat hone kii gunjaaish nahin he or camodity kii keemten yaa to sthir ho jaaengi yaa ghatane lagengi
 It is seen in the second half of FY 2018 that the pace of economic growth and international trade has slowed down
 bharat ke liye bhi chunauteepurn samayiske alaava, bahupaksheeya vyapaar pranali ke kamjor padane, china or america ke bich trade war, europea sangh ke bheetar samasya jaisi kai vajahon se ‘anischitata badi’ he or in sabaki vajah se antarrashtriya vyapaar ke bhavishya ke rukh par dabaav dikh rahaa he
 This means that a more challenging time is coming for India
 bharat ko apana focus kapaas, anaaj, machhliyon, maance jaise praathmik vastuon or lo-tech product se hataakar ucch mulya vaali medium or hai-tech menuphaccharing vastuon kii ore le janaa hoga
 India's share of high-value global exports, according to the wto's World Trade Statistical Review 2019, which analyzed trade trends between 2008 and 2018, continues to dominate manufactured goods in global trade, with their trade share rising from 66 per cent to 68 during this period
 Has reached percent
 is dauraan eendhan or khanan utpaadon kaa hissaa 22 fisadi se ghatakar 19 fisadi rah gaya or krishi utpaadon kaa hissaa 8 fisadi se badhkar 10 fisadi tak pahunch gaya
 Analysis of trade data shows that in terms of US dollar, medium and high-tech manufacturing goods have an effective position in world exports
 iske vipareet bhartiya niryaat main praathmik vastuon or lo technology utpaadon kaa bada hissaa he
 Apart from this, many such items like medicines, oil products, auto components, diamonds are dependent on imports
 bharat ab bhi dollar ke mad main vaishvik niryaat kaa 2 fisadi hissaa hasil karne ke liye jujh rahaa he
 Its share 1 between 2010 and 2018
 5 se 1
 It has been 7 percent
 sheersh hai vailu vaali vastuon main bhi bharat kii hissedari bahut kamjor rahi he
 The total global trade of the top 10 high-value goods stood at $ 19,346 billion, of which India's share was just 323

 67 percent
 indian concil for research on international iconomic relations (ICRIER) kii professor nisha taneja is asantulan kii ore sanket karti hai
 He said that in the year 2018, about 70 percent of Indian exports were of primary and low-technology goods, while their share in world exports is only 40 percent
 industry chembar CII kii neshnal kamity on aczym ke chairman sanjay budhiya ne kaha ki vishwa kii sheersh niryaat vastuon jaise electronics or mashinari main bharat kaa hissaa bahut kam he
 Export of electronics and machinery from India in the year 2018 respectively 11
 8 arab dollar or 20 arab dollar kaa hua, jabaki is dauraan inkaa vaishvik niryaat kramash: 2
 8 trillion dollars and 2
 3 trillian dollar kaa hua
 However, Indian exports of mineral fuels, gems and jewelery and pharma products have been reasonable
 iske baavjood bharat kaa niryaat uske jidipi ke lihaaj se paryaapt nahin he
 According to a report of UNCTAD for the year 2018, India's trade imbalance is much higher than the global level
 jidipi or vaishvik vyapaar, donon ke lihaaj se bharat kaa vyapaar ghaataa bahut zyada he
 What is the reason for the poor performance of exports? Professor Taneja explains that the factors that have slowed down the export of manufactured goods have been around for a long time
 udhaaharan ke liye kamjor buniyadi dhaancha, baadhit or aparyaapt bijli aapurti, lenden kii oonchi laagat, kathor shram bazaar or shramikon main kushalta kii kami kii vajah se bharat kii pratispardhaatmakataa ko lagaataar chot pahunchati rahi he
 Unprecedented technological changes are taking place in the world, in which India will have to be prepared for the ongoing and new challenges
 indian institute of fahrren trade (IIFT) ke professor biswajit naag ne kaha ki bharat ko sabase zyada jarurat kaushal kii he, uske baad utpaadon, prakiya, vailu chen ko unnat banane tathaa vyapaarik buniyadi dhaanche main sudhaar kii jarurat he
 He said that skill development is more important because it can link employment with exports
 iske alaava ab chunki utpaadon kaa jeevanchakra kam ho gaya he, isliye anubhavon yani dusron kii galatiyon se hamen teji se siikhnaa hoga
 Furthermore, he emphasized that innovation needs policies and incentives to link trade to trade, trade to global value chains and skills
 iske alaava buniyadi dhaanche ke vikaas ke liye samgr ravaiya apnaanaa hoga
 According to NITI Aayog's strategy New India @ 75, one major hurdle in exports is high logistic costs
 iske mutabik bharat main logistic kii laagat jidipi ke 14 fisadi tak he, china ke alaava anya sabhi deshon main yah kaaphi kam he
 Exports can be increased by 5 to 8 percent by cutting logistics costs by 10 percent
 bhavishya main in kshetron par dena hoga dhyanprofessor taneja kehete hai ki nai technology main is baat kii kshamta he ki vah vyapaar main baari badlaav kare jisamen bharat pichad rahaa he
 Not only will India have to adopt new technology to deal with traditional commodity exports, but it will also have to move up its value chain and export of medium and high-tech goods so that our share in world exports is appropriate
 bharat kii trade policy ko is tarah ke lakshyon ke liye taiyaar karnaa hoga
 a 2019 study by ICRIER says that global trade in intermediate goods is growing, and they account for about two-thirds of the total trade
 saath hi, aisi vastuon ke niryaat ke maamle main bharat kaa hissaa bhi saal 2011 main kul niryaat ke 31
 32 in 2016 by 18%
 52% tak pahunch gaya he
 It identifies 15 intermediate market combinations where India is the most competitive - chemicals, iron and steel articles, glass products, plastics, leather intermediate inputs, cotton yarn, etc
 in vastuon ke niryaat ke liye europe sabase acha gantavy ho saktaa he
 These could be the measures CII suggests several measures to boost exports of intelligence high value products: market promotion and trade promotion, greater private sector investment in R&D, board to monitor business ease, FDI in key sectors , Greater investment in innovation through financial incentives and identifying selected sectors and products through special policies And to encourage them
 lekin in sabakaa yah matlab nahin he ki bharat praathmik vastuon ke niryaat ko nazarandaaj kar de
 However, the details provided in NITI Aayog's New India @ 75 strategy are a tremendous example of why India's exports are lagging behind and what the government's attitude is: 'taking feedback from all sides, the Government of India a consistent and stable agricultural export policy should be formulated, for a period of five to ten years and with provisions for mid-term review
 ise hasil karne ke liye tatkaal prayaas kiye jane chahie

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has again strongly attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Rafael Deal
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki puraa hindustan samajhataa he ki chaukeedaar chor he, or ve isko sabit karke dikhaaenge ki hindustan kaa pradhanmantri anil ambani kaa dost he or usne anil ambani se chori karwaai he
 Rahul said that on the day the investigation of the Rafael case will be done, two names will come out, Anil Ambani and Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha ki 30,000 karod rupee kaa contract HAL se chhinakar anil ambani ko kyon diya? hindustan ke yuvaaon se rojgaar kyon chhina gaya? rahul ne kade shabdon kaa istemaal karte hue kaha ki choron ne jo paisa liya he wo kisaanon kaa he, unki baton main koi funsane vaala nahin he
 Rahul Gandhi asked why the Prime Minister does not hold a press conference on this matter
 unhone kaha ki rafel par unke sawaal barkaraar hai
 Struggling over the jpc's demand on the Rafale deal, Rahul said that what is the problem for the government to form a joint parliamentary committee to investigate the matter
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki supreme court ko rafel vimaan kii keemton kii galat jaankaree di gai
 Rahul said, "the Supreme Court verdict states that the details of the price of the Rafale airplane are written in the CAG report and it has been shared with the Public Accounts Committee
 lekin khadge ji piesi ke adhyaksh hai or aisi koi report unhone dekhi hi nahin
 "rahul said that when someone lies, it comes out somewhere
 ab sarkaar ko unhen ye samajhaana hoga ki ye piesi report kahaan he?
 Rahul said, "how can it be that the PAC chairman did not see the report, the members of the Public Accounts Committee did not get to know about this report and got it to the Supreme Court
 " congress adhyaksh ne piem par tanj kasate hue kaha ki shaayad koi or piesi chal rahi he
 Probably running in the Parliament of France
 ho saktaa he modi ji ne apni piesi piemo main baitha rakhi ho
 Rahul said that this government has destroyed the institutions

 gujarat ke chunaav main jeet ke apane apane daawey hai or donon hi partiyaan, bhaajapa or congress bahumat se kam kaa daawa karne ko taiyaar nahin
 BJP has a face like Prime Minister Modi
 wo modi ke naam par vot maang rahi he or jeet kaa daawa bhi kar rahi he
 He is confident that the trust that has been in power in the state for 22 years will remain in him
 vahiin congress is ummid par kaayam he ki gujarat main modi kii anupasthiti or bhaajapa kii rajya sarkaar se logon kaa mohabhang uske liye sanjivani sabit hoga or congress bhaajapa ko rajya main haraa degi
 Among these contenders, one thing that has been most vocal and visible in this election is the anger of the people
 chunaav se pehle apane daure ke dauraan kai alag alag hisson or virgon ke logon se jo baatcheet kii, usamen bhaajapa ke prati asantosh saaf dikhaai de rahaa tha
 Not only the Patidar movement, there was a lot of anger among the people about the economic reforms and the governance of the state
 haalanki pichley teen chunaavon se bhaajapa ke prati logon main gussa dikhataa rahaa he lekin yah gussa modi ke raste ko roak paane main vifal rahaa he
 People were angry in the last two elections but they could not accept any other party as a better option than BJP
 lekin is baar ke chunaav main gussa vyaktigat he, mukhar he or bahuaiami he

 rahul se bhi zyaada piem modi ke liye nirnaayak he gujarat kaa janadeshkya voton main badalegaa gussaur yahi wo kaaran he jo bhaajapa ko rah-rahakar vichlit karata rahaa he
 During the entire Gujarat election, the essence of the restlessness and speeches of Prime Minister Modi seems to be choking this uneasiness
 yahi haal bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah or party ke baaki netaaon kaa bhi rahaa
 But the biggest question is still there
 ki gujarat ke logon main ye jo mukhar gussa dikhaai de rahaa he, kya wo voton main tabdeel ho paaegaa
 Will people really be able to transfer their anger to the voting machine options
 kya isbaar kaa gussa itnaa zyaada he ki log congress ko jitaane ke liye nahin, bhaajapa ko hataane ke liye amada he
 If this is the case then it is very bad news for BJP
 or agar aisa nahin he to bhaajapa ke laut aane par bahut aashcharya nahin hona chahie
 Actually, this anger is like a land for the Congress
 is zamin se congress satta parivartan kaa kaarak ban sakati he
 But the crisis of the Congress is that the situation of Amit Shah's management and bjp's strong organization is not in his state

 This situation will also go in favor of Congress
 lekin gussa agar vot main tabdeel nahin hua he yaa gusse se bharaa voter ghar baith gaya he to congress sabakuch jeetne kaa daawa karte hue bhi haari hui dikh sakati he
 The BJP is, in fact, distracted by the anger of the people of the state, not the Congress

 In the case of Parliamentary Secretary, the case of 21 mlas of the Aam Aadmi Party is in front of the Election Commission and after the decision in protest, the equation of the party can get messed up
 gujarat main chunavi sambhaavnaaon par phiraa panipiem modi or amit shah ke grih rajya gujarat main isi saal vidhansabha chunaa hone hai
 Arvind Kejriwal and Aam Aadmi Party have been working on the electoral strategy in Gujarat for the last two years
 khaskar bhrashtachar ke mudde par kejariwal bijepi ko gherte najar aate the
 But now the party's prospects in Gujarat may get a major setback after allegations of taking cash on themselves
 iske alaava gujarat main aam aadmi party ko ek ummid patidaar andolan ke netaa hardik patel se bhi thi lekin hardik ab shivasena ke saath hai
 This is a double blow to the Aam Aadmi Party in the state
 punjab main pherbadal kii jaldi kyon?punjab main bhale hi bijepi kii sahyogi akali dal chunaav haar gai ho lekin bijepi ko apane liye agar rajya main bhavishya main jagah banani he to aam aadmi party main mache ghamaasan se use phayda ho saktaa he
 The Congress is now in state power and the Aam Aadmi Party stands in opposition by winning 20 seats, but the Punjab AAP unit also appears divided in the ruckus in the Aam Aadmi Party
 ghuggi se kaman lekar ab bhagwant maan ko de diya gaya he
 If Ghuggi resigned from the party, many other leaders also turned away from the party
 isse pehle ghuggi ke netritv main 20 vidhayakon ne kumaar vishwaas ke paksh main chitthee likhi thi
 Punjab is the state where the party managed to win after Delhi
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main party ne keval punjab se hi 4 siten jiti thim
 How many possibilities in Rajasthan? Recently, Aam Aadmi Party leader Kumar Vishwas was put in charge of Rajasthan when he was running angry in the party
 gujarat ke baad bijepi ke liye aane vaale vakt main rajasthan kaa vidhansabha chunaav sabase ahm he
 Now the challenges will be less for the BJP due to the ruckus in the AAP
 aam aadmi party ke liye aarope-pratyaropon ke bich jagah bananaa ab kaaphi mushkil hoga
 The state of Maharashtra unit is also no less chaotic After the initial efforts to make the issue of corruption in Maharashtra with regard to the case of Nitin Gadkari's companies, the Aam Aadmi Party itself is now struggling in Maharashtra
 maharashtra main party ke shuruaati sadasyon main shaamil anjali damania or mayank gandhi jaise log ab kejariwal ke netritv ke khilaaf khadey dikhte hai
 In such a situation, the prospects for the Aam Aadmi Party in the state do not look special

 Maharashtra is a large state with 48 seats in the Lok Sabha, which is very important for both BJP and Congress
 orissa, tamilnadu or pashchim bengal jaise kuch bade rajyon main to donon hi partiyaan chunavi lihaaj se kamjor hai, jahaan unke badaae yaa ghatane kii sambhaavnaaen kaaphi kam hai
 But Maharashtra is different from them
 yah donon ke liye mahatvapurn rajya he kyonki yahaan sirf loksabhaa ke liye hi nahin, balki saal ke ant main vidhansabha ke liye bhi chunaav hone vaale hai
 In this way, it is not just a riot for Delhi, but is setting up the board of Mahabharata to reach Mumbai's ministry
 desh kii aarthik rajdhani kahi jane vaali mumbai maharashtra kii rajdhani he, isliye chunaavon main logon kii nigahen is par lagi hui hai
 As much as the state's Bollywood stars are attracted to it, almost the same attraction is towards the politics here
 raaj thakare ke netritv vaali maharashtra navnirmaan sena (emenes) ko hi len
 It has also not been recognized by the Election Commission as a state-level party
 phir bhi 16 may ko chunaav nateezon ke baad media main uske pradarshan par kaaphi charchaa hone kii ummid he
 The results this time are expected to be very different from the 2009 general election
 maharashtra main 4 se 12 april ke bich 1,651 uttardaataaon se kii gai baatcheet ke aadhaar par india today group-sisero ke opinian pole ke mutabik, yahaan loksabhaa kii 48 siton kaa nateeja 1996 main hui 11veen loksabhaa ke chunaav parinaamon jaisaa hi ho saktaa he
 Congress in 1996 34
 8 fisadi voton ke saath 15 siten hasil kii thim, jabaki bijepi or shivasena ke gathbandhan ko 38
 The state won 33 seats with 6 percent votes
 loksabhaa ke maujuuda chunaavon main congress-ensipi gathbandhan ke netritv vaale united progressive elliance (upie) ko 13 (2) or endie ko 32 (2) siten milane kaa anumaan he
 In Maharashtra, this alliance mainly consists of BJP and Shiv Sena
 india today group-sisero ke opinian pole ke mutabik, congress-ensipi gathbandhan ko 2009 ke mukaable is baar ke chunaav main 7 fisadi voton kaa nuksaan hone vaala he, jiske kaaran uski siten 25 se ghatakar 13 ho sakati hai
 This loss of the congress-ncp alliance can benefit the bjp-shiv Sena alliance — it may gain 8 per cent of the vote and its number of seats may increase from 20 to 32 in view of the possibility of an increase of 12 seats
 apane paaramparik sahyogi shivasena ke alaava bijepi ne republican party of india ke netaa ramdaas athavle ko rajyasabha main bhejkar unki party ke saath bhi gathjod kar liya he
 This party has a strong base of Dalits
 maharashtra main kareeb 10 fisadi aabaadi dalit he
 According to the India Today group-cicero referendum, there is a wave of Narendra Modi in Maharashtra
 yahaan pradhanmantri ke taur par 46 fisadi uttardaataaon kii pasand modi hai, jabaki rahul gandhi ko sirf 20 fisadi logon ne is pad ke liye pasand kiya he
 NDA also appears ahead in the race for the post of Chief Minister
 shivasena ke uddhav thakare 15 fisadi logon kii pasand ke saath sabase aage hai
 The second rung is Ajit Pawar, NCP leader and nephew of Sharad Pawar, who is getting 10 percent support
 emenes supremeo raaj thakare or congress ke maujuuda mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan ko is pad ke liye pasand karne waalon kii sankhya ikai ank main hi simat gai he
 Maharashtra and Gujarat were created on November 1, 1956, by dividing the state of Bombay into two parts, but the politics of the two is completely different from each other
 gujarat main congress or bijepi ke bich sidhi ladaai he, jabaki maharashtra main aisa nahin he
 There are also two big players here - Shiv Sena and NCP
 haalanki ye donon hi partiyaan apane sankraman kaal se guzar rahi hai
 When Shiv Sena founder Bala Saheb Thackeray handed over his political legacy to his son Uddhav Thackeray, his nephew Raj Thackeray formed the MNS in 2006, triggering a rebellion
 bala sahib kii viraasat kii ladaai ab bhi jari he
 This is the first election after the death of Balasaheb in 2012
 bijepi, shivasena or emenes ke bich gathbandhan kii atakalein ab khatm ho chuki hai, lekin bijepi ke ummidavaaron ko emenes ke samarthan kii baat jari he
 The India Today group-cicero opinion poll shows that even though the MNS has lost its base in the mumbai-thane region, it remains the base in other areas
 2009 ke baad se iske voton ke pratishat main maamuli badhotaree ho sakati he or ise bhi ek seat mil sakati he
 In 2009, the MNS caused tremendous damage to the bjp-shiv Sena alliance by securing more than one lakh votes in 9 out of 10 Lok Sabha seats in mumbai-thane area
 is baar vah nuksaan mumbai-thane tak hi simit rahegaa
 Maratha leader Sharad Pawar left the Congress by making foreign origin an issue to protest against the appointment of Sonia Gandhi as Congress President
 unhone june, 1999 main ensipi kaa gathan kiya tha
 Pawar has now announced his decision not to contest, leading to a war of party's legacy between his daughter Supriya Sule and nephew Ajit Pawar
 vidarbha ke ilaake main kisaanon kii aatmahatya or raju shetty kii swabhimani shetakari sanghatana ke saath bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan kaa talmail ensipi ke liye chintaa kii nai vajah ban chukaa he
 In alliance with Congress, NCP has ruled not only the country but also Maharashtra since Vilasrao Deshmukh became the Chief Minister in 1999
 is tarah upie ke khilaaf dohari satta virdohi bhaavana kaam kar rahi he
 The India Today group-cicero opinion poll shows that 56 percent of voters are dissatisfied with the UPA government at the center
 kisaanon kii aatmahatya, bijli kii kami or sinchai ghotaale ne upie kii chintaaen or badha di hai
 Surveys show that it has lost its popularity among all communities, youth (below 25 years) and illiterate voters except tribals
 purv mukhyamantri ashok chavaan marathavada kii nanded loksabhaa seat se congress kii tikat par chunaav lard rahe hai
 After Chavan, who is himself the son of a former chief minister, was found involved in the Adarsh housing scam, he had to leave the chief minister's chair
 lekin unhen loksabhaa kaa tikat milane se rajya main upie kii sambhaavnaaen or bhi kamjor ho gai hai, jabaki duusari taraf suresh kalmadi hai, jo pune (pashchim maharashtra) se teen baar congress ke loksabhaa saansad rah chuke hai or kaamanwealth khelon ke ghotaale main aaropee hai
 Not giving him a Congress ticket has created a problem for the UPA
 india today group-sisero opinian pole ke mutabik, vidarbha or marathavada kii 18 loksabhaa siton par upie pichad rahaa he
 a similar situation is also present in 14 seats in Konkan and Western Maharashtra
 raaj thakare kii emenes ke khatre ke alaava endie ke liye apni bhi chintaaen hai
 The relationship between former BJP president Nitin Gadkari and the party's state unit leader Gopinath Munde is reportedly not good
 maharashtra main marathi maanus (marathi janata) ke prati shivasena kaa jhukaav or gujarat main bijepi kaa gujarati asmita ek-duusare se bilkul bhinn he
 Due to this many times an uncomfortable situation arises, because a large number of people come from other parts of the country and live in Maharashtra
 kareeb 10 fisadi muslim aabaadi main endie kii apil simit dikhti he
 But the problems and challenges are less for NDA than UPA
 sharad pavaar maharashtra main congress kii jameen bachaane ke liye 1987 main indian neshnal congress (socialist) chhodkar tatkaaleen congress (aai) main waapas aa gaye the
 That culture is currently under threat in this state
 duusari taraf raajnneeti kii nai dhara aam aadmi party (aap) ne saamaajik kaaryakarta medha patkar or purv banking profeshnal mira sanyaal samet maharashtra main sabhi 48 siton par apane ummidavaar khadey kiye hai
 In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, three independent candidates were elected from Maharashtra, including two from non-recognized parties
 is baar bhi 2 (1) siten upie yaa endie se itar ummidavaaron ko mil sakati hai
 But the kind of success that AAP had in the 2013 assembly elections in Delhi is unlikely to be achieved in Maharashtra or Mumbai in particular
 vaise to dilli ke chore ke taur par bollywood main dhooma machaane vaale akshay kumaar rahe hai, cricket ke maidan main sabake chakke chhudaane vaale sahvaag rahe hai or bade-bade diggajon ko patkhni dene vaale susheel rahe hai lekin in dinon dilli ke ek or chore kii charchaa bharat sahit puri duniya main ho rahi he
 The name of this chore is Saif Siddiqui and he is the most respected ji of Delhi
 di goenka skool ke purv chaatr rahe hai
 However, he has been living abroad for the last several years
 
 
 aakhir kin vajahon se charchaa main hai saf?saf siddiqui necaimare ke flishase bachane vaale scorf ko banane kaa kaam kiya he
 It is a unique and unique invention of its kind
 yah un tamaam charchit hastiyon ko photovernlist (papaaraji) se bachaata he jo har samay mashhoor shakhsiyaton ko follow karte rahete hai
 He has created such tremendous scarves with his team
 ise banane main unhen lanbaa samay laga he or ise unhone oktober maah main saal 2015 main launch kiya tha
 This scarf avoids mobile and camera flash
 
 
 ham aise daur main rah rahe hai jahaan har kisi ke paas smartphone he or smartphone main hai dephination camere bhi hai
 Apart from this, people also move around with cameras
 tamaam mashhoor shakhsiyaten aise main khud ko public places par asurakshit mahasoos karti hai
 In view of this, Saif thought of something so that he could save others from all these attentions
 paris hilton or camerun diaj jaisi shakhsiyaten hai unki mureed
 
 
 Today, her scarves are worn by Hollywood celebrities
 mashhoor footballar or singer unke mureed hai
 Her creations are being discussed on all the fashion shows and platforms of the world
 use unhone ISHU kaa naam diya he
 If someone uses a flash while wearing it, the picture becomes blackout
 ab har vakt kii media atension se bachane waalon ko or kya chahie hoga bhala
 
 
 Will launch in India soon 
 
 saf apane is product ko jald hi bollywood main launch karne kii koshish main lage hai
 They have chosen the month of August for this
 ve ummid kar rahe hai ki yahaan bhi unhen acha rispons milegaa, or ham to bas yahi dua karenge ki saf ke madhyam se bharat kaa naam duniya ke har kone main pahunch jaae
 
 
 There was a furore when Bharatiya Janata Party candidate Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur from Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh called Nathuram Godse, the killer of Mahatma Gandhi, a patriot
 bhartiya janata party ke alaava puure vipaksh ne is bayaan kii ninda kii jiske baad unhen maafee maangani padi
 But this ruckus had not yet stopped in the manner that another statement of Minister Anant Hegde came in the Modi government, he said that the time has come that meaningful discussions will be taking place after 7 decades about Nathuram Godse
 anant hegade ne shuukravaar subah twit kar likhaa, ‘main khush hum ki kareeb 7 dashak ke baad aaj kii peedi nae badlaav ke saath is mudde par charchaa kar rahi he
 Hearing this discussion, Nathuram Godse must be feeling good today '
 ek anya twit main unhone likhaa ki ab samay he ki aap mukhar hon or maafee maangane se aage badhen, ab nahin to kab?’ anant hegade ne ye twit ek twit ke jawaab main diya he
 However, after the ruckus, Anant Hegde said that his Twitter account was hacked
 unhone in twits ke liye khed bhi jataayaa
 My Twitter account has been breached twice in the past one week and certain tweets have been posted on my timeline which has been discarded and deleted
 Regret the posts attributed to me
 - Chowkidar Anantkumar Hegde (@anantkumarh) May 17, 2019 Let us know that Anant Hegde is the same minister who has made headlines due to his statements many times in the last five years
 modi sarkaar banane ke kuch samay baad hi unka samvidhan badalane ko lekar jo bayaan aayaa tha, usase unhen rashtriya str par pahchaan mili or uske baad vah lagaataar is prakaar kii bayaanbaji karte rahe
 The controversy over the statement of Sadhvi came after the statement of Anant Hegde after the statement of Sadhvi Pragya, in which Sadhvi Pragya described Nathuram Godse as a patriot
 sadhvi pragna ne kaha tha, ‘nathuram godse deshbhakt the, hai or rahenge
 People of the country will respond this time to those who oppose them
 ise bhi padhein
 
 
 Sadhvi Pragyanasadhvi's statement, which caused embarrassment for BJP with her statements thrice in a month, caused a storm in the political circles and the entire opposition condemned the BJP for this
 aanan-fanan main bijepi ne bhi khud ko sadhvi ke is bayaan se alag kiya or unhen maafee maangane ko kaha, jiske baad der raat sadhvi ne pehle bayaan jari kar or phir twit kar maafee maangi

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special news letters The matter is constantly getting heated over the secret files related to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose
 bijepi netaa or purv kendriya mantri subrahmanyam swami ne daawa kiya he ki netaji kii maut vimaan durghatana main nahin hui thi
 Subrahmanyam Swamy said that while he was the Union Law Minister, he had seen secret files related to Subhash Chandra Bose
 swami ne daawa kiya ki us dauraan japan ne ek baar bharat se kaha tha ki vah renkoji temple se netaji kii asthiyon kii raakh le jaae
 Subrahmanyam Swamy said that confidential files show that Netaji did not die in the plane crash
 ve china chale gaye the
 China was then ruled by Russia
 swami ke mutabik, rus ne china se netaji ko giraftaar karke unhen siberia kii ore bhej diya tha
 Then Nehru wrote a letter to Attlee, the Prime Minister of Britain, but Stalin kept Netaji in Russia, keeping him in deception
 PM ne diya he filein saarvajanik karne kaa bharosasubrahmanyam swami ne subhash chandra bose se judi baton kaa khulaasa aise vakt main kiya he, jab pradhanmantri narendra modi se milane aae netaji ke parijanon se piem ne netaji se judin filon ko saarvajanik karne kaa bharosa de diya he
 35 family members of Netaji were called to pm's residence
 piem ne ye elaan bhi kiya ki centre ke paas maujuud netaji kii gumshudagi se judi sabhi filein 2016 main netaji ke janmdin se saarvajanik kerani shuru kii jaaengi
 It is a question of death in a plane crash that it is recorded in the history books that Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose died in a plane crash 70 years ago
 lekin netaji ke gharavaalon ko is baat par bharosa nahin he
 He feels that there was a conspiracy with Netaji and his death is also wrapped in 70 layers of mystery

”a photo posted by Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) on Jan 21, 2017 at 10:20am PST After the crash of the mig-21, an Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, who was caught in pok, was beaten up in Pakistan
 is baat kaa khulaasa wing commander abhinandan ke medical report se hua he
 According to the report of the news agency ANI, the medical report of Army Hospital of Delhi confirmed Abhinandan's rib injury
 iske saath-saath unki ridh kii haddi main bhi chot kii baat saamne ai he
 According to the news agency ANI, Army officials believe that Abhinandan may have suffered this injury when he was trapped among the locals after he landed from the parachute
 bataa den ki is dauraan sthaneey logon ne abhinandan ke saath marpet bhi kii thi
 According to sources, the medical examination of Abhinandan may go on for the next few days
 wing commander kii itani medical jaanch isliye karai ja rahi he taaki yah bhi pataa lagaaya ja sake ki pakistan ne kahin jasusi ke uddeshy se unke sharir main koi yantra yaa is tarah kii koi cheez to nahin lagaai he
 Significantly, Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman met Wing Commander Abhinandan last Saturday afternoon
 is dauraan raksha mantri ne kaha tha ki samooche raashtra ko unke saahas evam dridhtaa par garv he
 Senior Air Force officers were also present along with the Defense Minister
 sutron ke anusaar bhartiya vayusena ke ek medical santhaan main hui mulaakaat ke dauraan abhinandan ne pakistan kii giraft main kareeb 60 ghante rahane ke bare main raksha mantri ko vistaar se jaankaree di
 It may be noted that Abhinandan arrived in India late Friday evening through the attari-wagah border and after about two and a half hours, at about quarter to 12, he reached New Delhi by an Air Force plane
 unke bhartiya seemaa main pravesh karne par yah paaya gaya ki unki daayin aankh ke paas sujan he
 He is currently undergoing medical examination at Air Force Central Medical Establishment (AFCME)
 bataa den ki unhen pakistani adhikariyon ne 27 farvari ko pakad liya tha
 In fact, his mig-21 collapsed during a skirmish with Pakistani fighter jets
 lekin unhone apane vimaan ke girane se pehle pakistani vayusena ke epa - 16 ko maar giraaya tha
 After Abhinandan's medical examination after his return to home, he has now been shifted to the Air Force Hostel
 haalanki abhi tak yah saaf nahin paaya he ki abhinandan kii medical report main kya nikal kar aayaa he
 Indeed, on Friday Pakistan was about to hand over the wing commander Abhinandan to India
 iske liye bharat kii ore se puri taiyaariyaan kii ja chuki thim
 Air force officials, Indian embassy officials and government representatives were ready at all times, but Pakistan's tactics were carried out from noon to night
 pehle pakistan kii ore se hi bataaya gaya tha ki abhinandan ko vah kareeb dopaher main 3 se chaar baje ke bich main reeha kar degaa, magar usne baar-baar deree kii
 There are many reasons behind this
 masalan, vah is ghatana ko lim lite main laana chahta tha
 He wanted the whole world to see this news
 shuukravaarsham ke teen baje ke aas-paas abhinandan ko pakistan ne rawalpindi se lahore pahunchaa diya gaya tha
 But he took so long to bring the Wagah border from Lahore, due to which his evil intentions were also revealed in front of him
 sutron kii maane to abhinandan ko lahore main sthit kisi sena ke chhavnee main roak kar rakhaa gaya tha or pakistan neabhinandan kaa jabarnek video banwaaya
 It is also true that the process of documentation between Pakistan and India was delayed for some time, but this delay was not so much that the return of Abhinandan should take place from noon to night
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar bhartiya payalat abhinandan ko bharat ko saunpe jane main deree isliye hui kyonki, unase pakistani adhikariyon ne camere par bayaan darj karne ko kaha
 Only after this he was allowed to cross the border and go home
 iske alaava dastavejon se sambandhit mudde bhi deree kii vajah bani
 Sources had said that Pakistan postponed his release time twice
 punjab congress ke pramukh amarinder singh ne agle saal rajya main hone vaale chunaav main navjot singh siddhu or unki patni donon ko tikat dene kii sambhaavna ko buudhvaar ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki ek parivaar, ek tikat ke niyam ko sakhti se lagu kiya jayega
 The statement of Amarinder Singh, who is leading the Congress campaign in Punjab, will come a day after the meeting between Sidhu and Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 congress pehle hi apane aadhe ummidavaar tay kar chuki he or bakaul singh yah siddhu danpati ko tay karnaa he ki donon main se congress ke tikat par chunaav koun ladega
 Sidhu was denied the offer of the post of Deputy Chief Minister and he also said that there is no discussion in the Congress about the offer of the Deputy Chief Minister to Kisidhu
 unhone kaha ki ye sab media dwaara lagaai ja rahi atakalein hai
 The former Punjab chief minister told reporters that he would soon meet Sidhu to discuss the modalities of joining the party

 The injury to captain Virat Kohli's shoulder on the first day of Ranchi Test was a matter of concern for Team India
 40wein over main umesh yadav kii gend par peter hendscomb ke shot ko kohli ne roak to liya lekin apana kandhaa chotil kar baithe
 He was then seen bending over the ground and trying to handle his shoulder
 yahaan tak ki unhen kandhe par aais pack lagane kii zarurat padi or baad main puraa din dressing room main hi gujaarna padaa
 In such a situation, the responsibility of Team India fell on the shoulders of vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane

 But the team's fielding coach r Sridhar has praised Rahane's captaincy a lot

 He was posted in the outfield and also kept talking to bowlers well
 " shridhar ye bhi maanate hai ki pehle din ke liye ranchi kii pich acha ballebaazi trek sabit hui
 Like former captain Sunil Gavaskar, Sridhar too believes that Team India can make a comeback in the match
 unke mutabik england kii team ne bhi pichhali series main mumbai or chennai main achche score banaae the magar phir bhi team india vaapasi karne main kaamyaab rahi
 He says, "we have faced similar situations in Mumbai and Chennai and we had a tremendous return there too
 " purv captain gavaskar pehle hi kah chuke hai ki agle do-teen din pich ballebaazi ke liye acchhee rahegi
 In such a situation, it will be a challenge for the Indian bowlers to put the Kangaroo team in the first innings as quickly as possible

 "sridhar also believes that the Ranchi pitch proved to be a good batting track for the first day
 purv captain sunil gavaskar kii tarah shridhar bhi maanate hai ki team india match main vaapasi kar sakati he
 According to him, the England team had also scored well in Mumbai and Chennai in the previous series, but still Team India managed to come back
 wo kehete hai, "ham mumbai or chennai main aise hi halaat kaa saamana kar chuke hai or vahaan bhi hamane jabardast vaapasi kii thi

 bhaajapa ne pradhanmantri manmohan singh par aarope lagaaya ki unhone desh kii vartmaan kharaab arthvyavastha kaa sara dosha sidhe or khule taur par purv vitt mantri pranab mukherjee ke sir madh yah sabit kar diya he ki ek arthshaastri ke rup main unhen jarurat se zyada aanka jaataa he jabaki vah jitne ghaagh raajnneetik netaa hai, utana unhen samajha nahin jaataa
 Senior party leader Yashwant Sinha lashed out at the Prime Minister's interview in a newspaper interview during a press conference at BJP headquarters here, saying that Singh is now looking after that department after Pranab resigned as finance minister
 But his statements make it seem as if an old government has gone and now he is correcting his mistakes
 ’unhone pradhanmantri par kataaksh karte hue kaha, ‘pranab ke rup main vitt mantri kii aatma ko shanti de bhagwaan
 He said, the most ridiculous thing is that Manmohan is now trying to separate Pranab's decisions from his own
 vah kah rahe hai ki pichley kuch faislon ko badalanaa hoga
 Sinha said that while the reality is that the Prime Minister gives final permission to the budget proposals of any finance minister and even his budget speech
 unhone kaha ki pranab mukherjee or pi chidambaram jaise samprag sarkaar ke purv vitt mantriyon ke samay kiye gaye faislon se pradhanmantri khud ko alag nahin kar sakate hai
 Our system does not allow them to do so
 yah puche jane par ki desh kii bigadi arthvyavastha kaa dosha kya pradhanmantri paroksh rup se pranab ke sir madh rahe hai, bhaajapa netaa ne kaha, ‘paroksh nahin, sidhe or khule rup se pranab ko dosha de rahe hai, jo ki kuch din pehle tak unke sabase varisht sahyogi the
 Not only this, it is not that Pranab has retired but he is now the highest constitutional post candidate in the country
 ’unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri aaj vitt mantri ke taur par pranab ke faislon se khud ko dur karke dosha unhen de rahe hai, jabaki vah un sab faislon ke saajhedaar rahe hai
 He was still watching tukur tukur and still seeing tukur tukur
 ’pradhanmantri par praharon kii bauchhaar jari rakhte hue sinha ne kaha ki manmohan kaa puri jindagi apni jimmedaariyon or javabdehi se batch kar nikalne ke prayaas vaala bartaav rahaa
 He said that there was a lot of corruption during Singh's prime ministership but he wants to remain a lotus in the mud despite being the head of the government
 ’yah puche jane par ki pranab ko kya isi kaaran raashtrapati pad kaa ummidavaar banaaya gaya ki arthvyavastha kii gadabadi kaa dosha unke maththe madh sarkaar apni chhavi saaf rakh sake, unhone kaha, ‘shaayad’
 Regarding the story of the Prime Minister's interview, he said that after reading it, it seemed that the Chief Advisor of the government, not the Prime Minister, was speaking that we should do it, but in one place he did not say that he would do it, he would do it
 singh ke intervyuu ko sinha ne ‘paraajay, hataasha or andhere bhavishya kaa bayaan’ qaraar diya
 However, he congratulated Manmohan that 'he opened his mouth only after a time
 ’intervyuu main pradhanmantri kii is baat par unhone kadi aapatti jataai ki samprag sarkaar ko rajg ke chah saal ke shashan ke galat faislon ko thik karne main apana kaaphi samay lagaana padaa
 Sinha said that in this interview, the Prime Minister has accepted the truth that there is no political consensus in his government, due to which many important decisions have not been made
 sarkaar ke sudhaar kaaryakramon main bhaajapa ke samarthan dene ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri ne vipaksh se sahyog maanga hi nahin he

 The couple also practiced briefly at the Medical Center at Thiruvallur in Kozhikode
 unka 18 maheene kaa ek betaa ayaan tha or duusare bachche ke liye rifila pet se thim
 Then on May 28, the Ijas family suddenly disappeared

 Ijas's younger brother was 24-year-old Shihas and his wife, 22-year-old wife Ajamla
 ajamala kaa bhi garbh ab aakhri maheenon main tha
 His relative Ashfaq Majeed, 25, who runs a hotel business in Mumbai, his wife, 23-year-old man and his 18-month-old daughter Ayesha, were also missing
