diwali ke maukey par kharidaaron se gulzaar rahane vaale dilli ke bazaar is baar bejaar najar aa rahe hai
 Asia's largest Sadar Bazaar is the first choice of buyers during the festival season, whether retail traders or general buyers
 lekin in dinon sadar bazaar se kharidaar lagbhag gaayab dikh rahe hai
 In the firecrackers market, the silence is falling on the vendors
 diwali par log ghar kii saaj-sajaavat par dil khol kar paise kharch karte hai
 Those who have to buy home appliances, they also keep waiting for offers and sale in the festival season
 jis sadar bazaar main diwali ke dauraan pair rakhane tak kii jagah nahin hoti, us sadar bazaar main dukandaar graahakon kaa intjaar karte najar aa rahe hai
 According to the traders of Sadar Bazaar, there is a decline of about 50 percent in the market this year
 dilli ke karol baag market kaa haal bhi sadar bazaar jaisaa hi he
 The color of this market, which is famous for clothing and jewelry, has also faded
 dhanteras par bheed hone kii vajah se aksar log saptaah bhar pehle hi sone-chaandi ke gahane select kar lete the or delivery dhanteras ke shubh din lete the, lekin is saal aise graahak dukaanon par kam hi najar aae
 According to CAT, there is a decline of about 30 per cent in sales this year compared to last year
 cat ke rashtriya mahaamantri praveen khandelwal ke mutabik, "vyapaariyon ne is varsh achche tyohaari sijan kaa anumaan lagaate hue baari maatra main stock kar liya he or ab unki chintaa he ki stock kaa kya hoga
 Some sectors such as electronics, kitchen items, gift items, sweets, home decor, readymade garments, furnishing fabrics have been directly affected by the recession, while other items in the market have also seen a significant decline
 real estate, sona-chaandi kii kharidari main bhi haal kuch acha nahin he
 "kat also blamed e-commerce companies like Amazon, Flipkart for this
 saath hi kaha ki jiesti se upje bhram ne bazaaron main afra-tafari failaa rakhi he, jiske tahat tyohaar se jude adhikansh vastuon par adhiktam28 fisadi kaa taxlag rahaa he or upabhokta itnaa zyada tex dena nahin chaahate
 Usually, from Navratri to Diwali, there was a tremendous excitement in the markets of Delhi
 dilli vaale tyohaari sijan main paise kharchane main awwal maane jate hai, lekin is saal na to bazaaron main graahakon ko lubhaavne ophers mil rahe hai, na hi kharidaar dil khol kar kharch kar rahe hai
 Hence, Raunak is missing from Delhi markets, and traders are disappointed

 The process of keeping each other's plans under question is continuing between Delhi and the Central Government

 He has written a letter to the country's Health Minister Harsh Vardhan
 chitthee ke jariye arvind kejariwal ne is yojana par sawaal uthaate hue poocha he ki jab haryana-uttar pradesh main lagu he ayushmaan yojana phir dilli ke aspataalon main kyon ilaaj karaane aate hai
 Apart from this, the Chief Minister of Delhi also claimed that while the government spends 5 lakhs in the central scheme, on the other hand the government spends up to 30 lakhs in the Delhi government's scheme
 arvind kejariwal ne apane letters main likhaa ki dilli or centre sarkaar donon kii yojanaon kaa makasad he ki logon ko swasthy sambandhi suvidhaayen milen
 He wrote that no one would be benefited by discontinuing the health plan already running in Delhi and implementing another plan
 agar dilli swasthya yojana ko band kar ayushmaan bharat ko lagu kiya gaya to lakhon dillivaasiyon kaa nuksaan ho jayega
 Arvind Kejriwal told the Union Health Minister through letter that, 'if in your (harshvardhan's) eyes, there is something in Ayushman India which is not in Delhi's health plan, please tell

 He was continuously claiming to raise a crowd of 5 lakh, but the crowd gathered around fifty thousand

 The special thing is that he neither said anything against Samajwadi Party nor Congress
 'ghotaale ke paise se color tivi mil saktaa tha'lekin amit shah ne samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar ke khilaaf bhi bolaa
 He said that a fierce battle is going on in the Samajwadi Party from India and this whole fight is about the sharing of loot money
 unhone kaha ki pehle chachaa-bhattije ko nikaal detaa he phir bhatija-chachaa ke logon ko nikaal detaa he
 Amit Shah said that Amar Singh is in the role of Narada
 amit shah ne kaha ki khanan ke ghotaale main jitna paisa gaya he use uttar pradesh ke har ghar main ek color tivi aa saktaa tha
 Amit Shah said that Taj Corridor scam, police recruitment scam and NHRM scam took place under Mayawati's rule
 unhone kaha ki ek taraf samaajawaadee party main ajam khan, abu azmi or ansaari jaise log hai to duusari taraf nasimuddin siddiki jaise log bispi main hai
 Therefore, law and order cannot correct both these parties and only BJP can do this work

 The judges of several portfolios of the Madras High Court made 8 serious comments on the man
 katju kaa daawa he ki madras hai court ke acting chif justise ne ek jatke main bhrasht jaj par lage sabhi aaropon ko khaarij kar diya jiske baad use hai court kaa adishnal jaj banaaya gaya
 This happened when the Congress-led UPA was at the Center and its ally DMK was in power in Tamil Nadu
 katju ke mutabik, 'us bhrasht jaj ko tamilnadu ke ek bade rajaneta kaa samarthan praapt tha
 According to the information, that person had granted bail to the politician as a judge of the district court
 'markandeya katju ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya he ki supreme court ke purv chif justise aar si lahoti ne shikaayat ke baavjood us bhrasht jaj ko pad par bane rahane diya
 The Manmohan Singh government played an important role behind this
 manmohan singh ko upie ke ek mantri ne dhamkee di thi ki agar jaj ko hataaya jaataa he to centre sarkaar gir jaaegi
 After this, a Congress leader pressured the former Chief Justice not to take action against this additional judge
 iske baad us shaks ko adishnal jaj ke taur par ek saal kaa ekstansion diya gaya tha
 Chief Justice RC Lahoti did nothing, says Markandeya Katju, 'I was getting a corruption report about that judge
 maine chif justise aarasi lahoti se aaropee jaj ke khilaaf khufia ibi jaanch kii maang kii
 a few weeks later, Justice Lahoti stated that there was truth in the information given by me
 ibi ko jaj ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke pukhta saboot mili hai
 The two-year term of the corrupt additional judge was on the verge of ending
 mujhe laga ki ibi report ke baad use jaj nahin bane rahane diya jayega
 But he got a one-year extension as additional judge
 haalanki 6 or adishnal jaj jinaki niyukti uske saath hui thi, unhen hoicourt kaa sthaayee jaj bana diya gaya
 Later i came to know that there is a collegium of three senior judges of the Supreme Court to appoint a High Court Judge
 us vakt chif justise lahoti, justise waike sabarwal or justise ruma paal sabase varisht the
 This collegium of judges of the Supreme Court, based on the IB report, recommended no further extension after completion of the two-year term of the corrupt judge
 'manmohan sarkaar ne bhrashtachari jaj ko dilvaaya ekstensionmarkandeya katju likhte hai, 'upie sarkaar us vakt satta main thi
 The Congress was the largest party but did not have a majority
 uske saathiyon main se tamilnadu kii ek party is bhrasht jaj kaa samarthan kar rahi thi
 This party protested against the recommendation of the judges
 meri jaankaree ke mutabik manmohan singh sanyukt raashtra kii mahasabha main hissaa lene ke liye neuyork ja rahe the
 During this time, Tamil Nadu ministers told Manmohan Singh that the government would fall by the time he returned from New York
 unki party samarthan waapas le legi (agar adishnal jaj ko uske pad par nahin bane rahane diya gaya)
 Manmohan Singh came into the can
 haalanki ek senior congressi mantri ne unhen pareshaan naa hone kii salaah di
 He then met Minister Justice Lahoti and informed him of the danger on the government
 iske baad justise lahoti ne chitthee likhakar us bhrasht jaj ko adishnal jaj ke taur par ek saal kaa ekstansion dene kii sifarish kii
 It is not known whether the Chief Justice spoke to other members of the collegium
 'chif justise sabarwal or balakrishnan ne bhi bhrasht jaj ko badhaava diyaaise adishnal jaj ko agle chif justise sabarwal dwaara ek or kaarykaal diya gaya
 Subsequently, the next Chief Justice KG Balakrishnan appointed him a permanent judge
 haalanki uskaa transfar duusare hai court main ho gaya
 After Assam, now the demand for updating the National Register for Citizens (NRC) has also started
 supreme courtne is bare main centre sarkaar, janaganana ayukta, chunaav ayog or videsh mantralay se raay maangi he
 In fact, the Tripura People's Front has filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court demanding the repatriation of all illegal migrants from the state
 in pravaasiyon main zyaadaar bangladeshi hai
 The petition states that large-scale Bangladeshi migrants have been indiscriminately infiltrated into the state in the last five decades
 isse rajya ke jansankhya dhaanche main kaaphi badlaav aayaa he
 It states that Tripura was originally a tribal state, but due to such incursions it has become a non-tribal state and its natives have become a 'borok' minority
 gauratlab he ki tripura ke mukhyamantri biplab kumaar deb ne haal main kaha tha ki agar assam menenarasisafal rahata he to vah tripura main bhi ise lagu karenge
 The final draft of NRC has been released in Assam, after which there has been a lot of uproar, as it has left 4 million people out
 piiel main kaha gaya he, 'enarasi kaa gathan 1951 main hi ho gaya tha, jisaki vajah se tripura main isko apadet karne kii sakht jarurat he
 In Tripura, the issue of flood of illegal migrants is more serious than in Tripura
 'assam main bhi pichley teen dashakon main hone vaale avaidh ghuspaith kii gambhir samasya ko dekhte hue enarasi ko apadet karne kii jarurat mahasoos kii gai thi

 Dhoni's press conference was very brief after the match as the Saurashtra Cricket Association lost power
 dhoni ne apni team kii nau ran kii haar ke baad kaha ki haa hamane aakhri do overon main kaaphi ran lutaaye
 We had started well in batting but we did not have enough wickets in the last ten overs to put pressure on them
 yadi main do over or tike rahata to paristhitiyaan kuch or hoti
 SCA officials had switched off to conduct sound and laser shows for the audience present even after the award distribution ceremony
 dhoni ne tab tak kuch sawaalon ke jawaab diye the jabaki bijli gul kar di gayi jiske kaaran bhartiya captain ko bhi kahana padaa ki kya yaheen par samaapt kar den
 Winning England team captain Alastair Cook could not address the media
 bhartiya tej gendbaaj ishanth sharma ne 49wein over main 20 ran jabaki bhubaneshwar kumaar ne aakhri over main 18 ran lutaaye the
 Dhoni replied in the negative when a local journalist asked if the team management had made a wrong decision by putting out the run machine Cheteshwar Pujara
 unhone kaha ki jaisaa maine kaha ki hamen kuch wicket bachaaye rakhane kii jarurat thi lekin aisa nahin hua
 If i had stayed two overs and the situation would have been different
 bhartiya cricket team ke captain mahendra singh dhoni ne viraat kohli or shikhar dhawan ke bich 'takaraav' kii khabaron ko galat bataaya he
 On Wednesday, Dhoni responded to the media's question in a sarcastic tone and said that these stories are more in the script of a film
 'ladaai' ke baad kohli-dhawan main hui dosti!gauratlab he ki brisben test main bharat kii duusari pari se pehle practice ke dauraan shikhar dhawan kii kalai main chot lag gai thi
 After this, on the fourth day, he did not go to the opening with Cheteshwar Pujara, but instead Virat Kohli came to the crease, but went out early
 angreji akhbaar 'hindustan times' ne daawa kiya tha ki iske baad kohli or dhawan ke bich dressing room main bahes hui thi or kohli ne dhawan kii khel bhaavana par sawaal uthaaya tha
 When Dhoni was asked about this at the press conference, he said in a mocking tone, "actually Virat took the knife and killed Shikhar
" dhawan chot se ubre or phir hamane unhen ballebaaji ke liye majaboor kiya
 These are all stories
 maarval yaa warner bros ko iskaa istemaal karke ek acchhee film bana deni chahie
 i do not know where all this comes from
 'haalanki dhoni ne mana ki brisben test haarane ke baad dressing room kaa maahaul acha nahin tha
 But he also said, 'as far as the dressing room is concerned, we have a great atmosphere and there is no problem
 ' Underworld don Abu Salem in Taloja jail in Mumbai opened fire inside the jail, but the trigger was pressed to cross the border
 salem par hue jaanaleva hamale kii tafteesh ke baad ye saaf raho gaya he ki abu salem ke naam kii supaari denevaala koi or nahin, balki di-company kaa sipahasaalar chota shakeel tha
 This disclosure was made by no one else but the shooter himself who shot at Salem
 27 june kii raat sava 8 baje mumbai kii taloja jail kii barrack number 4 main abu salem par devendra jagataap ne jaanaleva hamalaa kiya tha
 According to police sources, Devendra Jagtap alias JD confessed his crime that he had carried out a deadly attack on Abu Salem at the behest of Chhota Shakeel, d Company's biggest warlord
 mumbai police ko die apane bayaan main jedy ne mana ki bharat nepali ke katl ke baad use paise kii kami khalane lagi or tab usne apane dost manoj kii marfat mumbai main chota shakeel ke gurgey raju se baat kii
 Raju provided a mobile and a SIM card to JD in April 2013 through Manoj
 or saath hi ye taakid bhi di ke use ek tay vakt par chota shakeel kaa phone aayega
 Devendra hid this mobile and SIM card in the speaker inside the yard and in the third week of April, when the bell rang on the jd's mobile phone at that fixed time, the small Shakeel was present on the other side
 us roj jedy ne pehali baar chota shakeel se baat kii thi
 JD, for the first time, was asked by Chhota Shakeel about jd's condition and JD told him about his problems
 is par chota shakeel ne usase kaha ki wo phikr naa kare wo sab sambhaal legaa
 After this, both decided a day and time to talk and after that both of them had a total of 7 or 8 conversations
 itnaa hi nahin jedy jab bhi peshi par jaataa to chota shakeel ke ishaare par use har baar 50 hajaar se lekar ek lakh rupee tak de die jate
 Then one day during the conversation, Chhota Shakeel tells Devendra Jagtap that Salem has betrayed d Company and wants to kill him
 iske baad usne salem ko maarane kii supaari jedy ko di
 Shakeel promised Devendra that he would also provide him arms to carry out this task
 iske kuch din baad 2 may ko phir jail main jedy ke mobile kii ghanti bajati he lekin is baar phone chota shakeel kaa nahin balki jedy ke dost manoj kaa aayaa tha
 Manoj told the Jedi on the phone that a pistol and 4 rounds have been arranged to kill Abu Salem
 pistaul or goliyon kaa intjaam ho chukaa tha
 Now all he had to do was to reach the jail somehow
 par ye kaam itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 But Chhota Shakeel's operatives had also planned it
 or aakhirkaar planning ke tahat jail ke andar bandook or goliyaan pahunch hi gayi
 After this, on 3 May, Manoj came to jail with the lawyer to meet the Jedi and then threw a box inside the wall above the meeting room
 is box ke andar pistaul or goliyon ko rakhaa gaya tha
 Jedi kept these boxes hidden in his barrack for two days
 do din ke baad jedy ne pistaul or goliyaan jail ke menget ke bagalvaale spikar me chhupaakar rakh die
 After this Shakeel would pressurize him to kill Abu Salem whenever he spoke to the Jedi
 tang aakar jedy ne may ke aakhri hafte main chota shakeel ke die mobile ko tod diya
 Then the Jedi decided on 27 June that he would do the work of Abu Salem that day
 us din jedy kii peshi bhi thi
 According to the plan, JD took out the pistol in his barrack before going to court
 shaam 7
 At 45, JD is brought back to jail
 uske baad wo pistaul qamar main chipa kar yard number 4 main gaya
 Salem was sitting near the door in his room and then after 5 to 10 minutes JD fired two shots at Salem as soon as he got a chance
 isamen se ek goli salem ke haath par lagi lekin do goliyaan chalane ke baad pistaul lock ho gai or tab tak police ne jedy ko pakad liya tha

 Another parking scandal has come to light in the MCD
 jahaan parking mafia ne emsidi adhikariyon se milakar emsidi ko hi karodon kaa chuunaa lagaaya diya
 The EDMC allotted 600 meters of parking space to the parking contractor in Kartar Nagar, but the contractor, in collusion with the MCD officials, converted it into 6000 meters
 yani ab ye thekedaar alot hui jagah se 10 guna zyada jagah kaa gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se istemaal kar rahaa he
 Something similar is the parking of Kailash Nagar Road near Gandhinagar
 is road par tay spes se kai guna zyada jagah kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 Former chairman of the EDMC Standing Committee, Mahek Singh says, "when i was the chairman, allotment of 600 meters was given to me during my tenure, but it was made 6000 meters
 ye bada ghotaalaa he emsidi ko karodon kaa chuunaa lag rahaa he
 Actually the parking mafia has also tied up with the police
 isiilie bina jaanch kiye police ne kartaar nagar parking ko 6000 meter ke kaagaj kii risiving aasaani se de di
 Anyone will be surprised to know how this gorakhandha business is going on
 jab santhganth ke jariye jagah le lee jaati he to phir yahi thekedaar usee jagah ko chote-chote hisson main alag-alag thekedaaron ko de detaa he or motaa munafa hasil karata he
 Due to collusion with the parking mafia, the concerned officer also reduced the 600 meters to 6000 meters in his computer
 kul milakar ye puri daal hi kaali he

 68 lakh rupee kaa bhugtan karata he
 This is the condition of every parking lot where you will be seen standing in a wildly in spite of not having a place

 narendra modi sarkaar ne kiraye kii kokh ke durupyog ko rokane ke liye sarogesi (regulation) bill 2019 paas karaane kii taiyaari kii he
 On Monday in the Lok Sabha, Health and Family Welfare Minister Dr
 harshavardhan ne is bill ko pesh kiya
 Through this bill, there is talk of constitution of National Surrogacy Board, State Surrogacy Board
 vahiin sarogesi kii nigaraanee karne ke liye jimmedaar adhikariyon kii niyukti karne kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 The Modi government introduced this bill in 2016 to prevent the misuse of surrogacy
 magar ab iske nae praaroop ko sarogesi regulation bill 2019 naam se pesh kiya gaya he
 Recently, the draft of the bill was approved in a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 makasad he ki kiraye ke kokh kaa vyavsaayik istemaal na ho
 In fact, in recent years, India is becoming a hub of surrogacy for couples in many countries of the world
 saroget maanon ke shoshan, sarogesi se paidaa hue bachche ko chhod dene or maanav bhrunon ke emport ke maamle saamne aae hai
 The Law Commission of India in its 228th report recommended a ban on commercial surrogacy
 jiske baad sarkaar ne yah pahal kii he
 What will be changed Many new provisions have been made in the proposed Surrogacy Regulations 2019 by the Narendra Modi government
 sarogesi kii anumati sirf santanheen vivaadit danpatiyon ko hi milegi
 Many conditions also have to be fulfilled in order to use the surrogacy facility
 jo mahila apni kokh sarogesi ke liye degi, uski sehat suraksha kaa dhyaan suvidha lene vaale ko rakhana hoga
 The bill also contains provisions regarding the rights of a child born with surrogacy
 bataa den ki sarogesi kii suvidha ve mahilaayein leti hai, jo shaareerik samasya ke kaaran maa nahin ban saktin
 In such a situation, renting the womb of another woman is called surrogacy
 jo maa apni kokh ko kiraye par dekar bachche paidaa karti he to use saroget madar kehete hai
 There have been allegations that people are abusing the womb of financially weak women on the basis of money
 kokh ke durupyog se mahilaon kii sehat se judi samasya paidaa ho rahi thi
 With this, the government has prepared to pass this bill to fully control the surrogacy system
 bill main rashtriya se lekar pradesh str par sarogesi board banane kii baat kahi gai he
 So that the government should monitor whether the womb of rent is being misused

 Otherwise, how can a person slaughter the same womb that gave birth to him? Hundreds of women were murdered in five private hospitals in Rajasthan for just a few thousand rupees, and the killing was done not by anyone but the doctors who had the responsibility of saving lives
 hindustan kaa ye wo ilaaka he jahaan aaj bhi betiyon ko maa kii god kii jagah maut kaa agosh miltaa he
 Daughters are still a curse and burden for the people here
 aaj bhi betiyon ko yahaan yaa to kokh main hi maar diya jaataa he yaa phir paidaa hone ke turant baad unki saanson kii door tod di jaati he
 But today the news that we are going to make you talk about is even more frightening and shocking than this
 kya aap yakeen karenge ki jindagi dene vaale doctor mahaj chand hajaar rupayon ke liye saikadon kokh kaa katl kar denge?ji haa, kokh kaa katl wo bhi us ilaake main jahaan sarkaar ne betiyon ke katleam ko rokane ke liye maa-baap ko paise dene kii skim nikaal rakhi he taaki wo betiyon ko acchhee tarah paal saken
 But see the situation that instead of daughters in the same state, the womb is being murdered directly
 jaahir he jab kokh hi nahin hoga to phir beti yaa bete kahaan honge?rongte khadey kar dene vaala ye sach saamne aayaa he rajasthan ke dausa jile se
 Where the childbirth of more than two hundred women was deceived and was murdered
 wo bhi sirf saal bhar ke andar
 The fear is that if the old figures are also revealed, then the number of the slaughtered womb will not reach thousands
 jaahir he ab aap jaananaa chaahate honge ki aakhir doctor kokh kaa katl kyon karenge? isse unhen kya phayda hoga? or kokh kaa ye katl ho kaise rahaa he? to aaie aapako silsiler puri kahani bataate hai
 The Rajasthan government is spending crores of rupees to save the lives of daughters, and see that some greedy doctors and hospitals in the same state are listening to hundreds of womb's forever
 philhal kareeb dhai sau kokh ke katl kii baat saamne ai he
 However, there are fears that the count may go into thousands
 ye he rajasthan ke dausa jile kaa bandikui ilaaka
 Like all of Rajasthan, in this area too, the government has started Janani Suraksha Yojana to stop the slaughter of daughters
 is yojana ke tahat garbhvatee mahilaon ko sarkari aspataalon main delivery karaane ke evaj main sarkaar har garbhvatee mahila ko 14 sau rupye detii he
 These money are given so that the parents do not kill the daughter in the womb
 sarkari astalon ke alaava sarkaar ne kai privet aspataalon ko bhi janani suraksha yojana kaa theka de rakhaa he
 That is, the pregnant women coming for delivery in these hospitals also get 14 hundred rupees from the government
 aise hi kul paanch privet aspataalon ke bare main ye sansanikhej khulaasa hua he ki yahaan maa banane vaali mahilaon ke ajanme bachche kii naa sirf hatya kar di jaati thi balki usase maa banane kaa sapana bhi hameshaa ke liye chin liya jaataa tha
 This truth came to the fore when the All India Ghatak Panchayat, an NGO working in Bandikui area of dausa, got the records of five such private hospitals under the Right to Information Act
 halanki enjio ko paanch main se sirf teen hi aspataalon ne aankade bheje par ye aakande hi ankhen kholane ke liye kaaphi thim
 Figures show that between March 2010 and September 2010, 385 women underwent surgery in which 226 women had their uterus removed
 in aankadon par sawaal isile uth rahe hai ki in mahilaon kii umr sirf 20 se 30 saal ke bich hi he
 Not only this, the hospital has also forged the names and addresses of these women so that they cannot be identified
 darasal in aspataalon main aane vaali garib mahilaon ko doctor ye kah kar daraa dete the ki unke garbhaashya main infections he or isse un kii jaan bhi ja sakati he
 After that, by making 12 to 15 thousand rupees, they would separate the concept from the body through operation
 jaahir he jiske baad mahila kabhi maa hi nahin ban sakati
 In many cases, doctors even gave birth to the concept on the complaint of minor abdominal pain
 is tarah kokh kaa katl kar doctor naa sirf oparation ke naam par 12-15 pandrah hajaar ruee kamaate balki janani suraksha yojana ke tahat milane vaale 14 sau rupye bhi dakaar jate
 According to the data, from March 2010 to September 2010, around two hundred and fifty operations were performed only on the uterus of women
 ye sach saamne aane ke baad sarkaar ne paanchon privet aspataalon ke khilaaf jaanch ke aadesh jari kar die hai
 Preparations are being made to reduce the price of petrol and diesel
 bhartiya sarkari tel companiyaan indian oil, bipisiel or echpisiel inakedaamon main katauteekarengi

 Even before this, the prices of petrol and diesel have been continuously falling and so far they have come down by 10 to 13 percent
 is samay antarrashtriya tel bazaar main kachche tel kii keemten girakar 82 dollar prati bairal tak ja pahunchi hai
 Since India imports a large part of its requirement, the change in its international prices has a direct effect here
 gauratlab he ki pichhali baar tel companiyon ne petrol kii keemton main 2
 41 was deducted by Rs

 This cut will also have an impact on the assembly elections in two states, because inflation has been a big issue in the past

 ek audyogic sanstha kii ore se yojit kaarykram main congress saansad ne kaha ki yah ek vyakti (modi) kii sarkaar he or har koi unke ishaare par naach rahaa he
 He said that India currently has the most centralized Prime Minister's office in history
 tharur ne kaha, 'har faisla piemo karata he
 Every file is sent to the PMO for approval
 'modi ke khilaaf bichchhu vaale bayaan par tharur ke khilaaf shikaayat darjpradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf bichchhu sambandhi tippanee ko lekar yahaan ke ek vakil ne shanivaar ko congress netaa shashi tharur ke khilaaf shikaayat darj karai
 The complaint said that Tharoor's remarks hurt Hindu sentiments
 police ne kaha ki shikaayat ke sambandh main kanoonee raay lee jaaegi kyonkithrurane bengaluru main tippanee kii thi
 a case of rape of a woman has been reported in Jaipur district of Rajasthan
 aaropee ne mahila ko shaadi kaa jhansa dekar uske saath balaatkaar kii vaardaat ko anjaam de daalaa
 Police is looking for the accused
 balaatkaar kii yah ghatana jaipur ke shivadaspura thana ilaake kii he
 The victim, who came to the police with a complaint, told the woman that she had friendship with a person named Deshraj
 baad main usne mahila se shaadi kaa vaada kar liya
 The woman also got caught in his bluff
 jiske chalate deshraj ne mahila ko akele paakar uske saath balaatkaar kiya
 And escaped from the scene after carrying out the crime
 police ne aaropee deshraj ke khilaaf bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 354 or 376 ke tahat maamla darj kar liya he
 Now the police will investigate the matter along with getting the victim medical
 aaropee kii talash kii ja rahi he
 His grandfather was a Pandit in Benares
 sanskrit ke prakand vidwaan
 The house also had a religious atmosphere
 lekin im se graduate us noujvaan kaa ishwar se bharosa tut gaya
 He started earning good money by being a banker away from home
 lekin chunki padhane kaa shauk or jane-anjaane mili dharmik sanskaron kii viraasat saath thi, to vah likhane laga
 Started writing the story of Shiva in his own way and then miraculously became a believer while writing
 pehali kitaab chhapakar ai to super-dupar-hit hui
 Then came two more books on the story of Shiva, which became the fastest selling book series in India
 unki shiv trilji kii kareeb 2
 It sold 5 million copies, a record in itself
 tishart-genes pahanakar puranic aakhyaanon ko apane tareeke se angreji main likhane vaale amish treepathi kii jindagi bhi unki vyakhyaaon jaisi dilachasp he
 His 'immortals of Meluha', 'secret of Nagaaj' and 'the Oath of Vayuputraaj' as 'shiva Trilogy' have been tremendous successes
 ab vah bhagwaan ram kii kahani likh rahe hai
 The first book of the Ram series 'sion of Ikshvaku' was released last month
 isi kitaab ke ek event ke liye vah pichley hafte dilli main the
 On July 4, he met and talked to Tafsil at the Taj Palace Hotel
 amish dharmik kahaniyon kii fictional tareeke se vyakhya karte hai jo bharat main raajnneetik taur par ek visphotak subject ho saktaa he
 Despite this, he is confident of staying away from controversies
 khud ko ram-bhakt swikaarne main vah hichakate nahin, par iske raajnneetik paksh par bhi khulkar saamne nahin aate
 Despite this, he is willing to talk with every aspect of the book with his express humility, respecting disagreements and advocates for creating 'balance' in life
 pesh he kuldeep mishra or nandlaal sharma se hui amish treepathi kii baatcheet:kuldeep: aap shiv trilji ke baad ram kii kahani likhane vaale hai jo bharat main raajnneeti or dharmik lihaaj se ek samvedansheel vishay he? phir bhi is vishay ko chunaa?amish:main dil se likhata hum
 Most controls are done
 lekhak khud karte hai
 So that publicity is found and the book comes out
 ram ji kii kahani or prerana sadiyon se chalaa aa rahaa he
 The politics you are talking about is from a few years
 ram to hamaare jehan or aatma main mili hue hai
 There is a lot to learn from his story
 to main controvarsi karata nahin hum, to hoti nahin he
 Kuldeep: Your explanation will be different from Tulsi or Valmiki Ramayana, on which if anyone has objections, there will be a dispute
 isamen aapke chaahe, na chaahe se kya hota he
 Like the gang-rape scene of Rosh's sister-in-law Roshni, who seems inspired by the Delhi gangrape
 koi use kahani kii tarah legaa, par kisi ke dharmik pratikon ko chot bhi lag sakati he?amish:yah is philosphy par discshan karne ke liye likhaa gaya he ki ahm kya he ki nyaay yaa kanoon
 You know that what happened was a crime and was carried out by a minor
 meri kitaab main jo cond he vah dilli se zyada nahin, balki america ke ek maamle kaa udhaaharan lekar likhaa he
 i want the minor's crimes to be discussed
 yah pashchimi deshon main bhi bahut he
 There was a big problem there in the 90s
 hamane tay kiya he ki koi 18 saal se kam umr kaa apradhi he to use zyada sajaa nahin di jaaegi
 In the United States, it has been decided that children above the age of 10 will also be punished in the serious crime
 is par charchaa to honi chahie hamaare desh main
 i am trying to ask the same
 main sahi or galat kii baat nahin kar rahaa he
 But i want the country to think about it
 meri kitaab main aap paaenge ki ram kanoon ke paksh main hai or bharat nyaay ke paksh main
 You will read the rest of the story in the book
 kuldeep: aapaki vyakhya valmiki, kamb yaa tulsi kii vyakhya se kaise alag he?amish:ramayana kii bahut vyakhyaayein hai
 If you ask most of the north Indians, they consider Tulsi Ramayana as Ramayana
 unase puuchhie ki kya lakshmana rekha kaa koi varnan he ramayana main? ve kahenge- haa
 But there is no mention in Valmiki Ramayana
 main bas ek udhaaharan de rahaa hum, aise bahut hai
 If you ask if Ram ji ever praised Ravana? People will say no
 lekin kamb ramayana main bahut mashhoor seen he jisamen ram or ravan ne ek-duusare kii prashansa kii, phir donon main yuddh hua
 If you ask who killed the chief Ravana, most people will say Shri Ram
 lekin hajaar saal puraane adbhut ramayana main sita maa ne maa kaali kaa rup lekar bade ravan kaa vadh kiya
 There are different aspects of going to Ram ji
 ek varjan meraa bhi he
 Nandlal: Today's generation is reading your books more than ramayana-ramcharitmanas
 kya aapako lagata he ki 20-25 saal baad aapaki kii hui vyakhya zyada prabhavi hongi?amish:are nahin nahin (haath jod lete hai)
 My books are not so good
 hamaari pratha itani sadiyon se chali aa rahi he
 It has been going on for thousands of years
 sadiyon rahaa he dushman daure-jahaan hamaara, kuch baat he ki hasti mitati nahin hamaari
 But it is a specialty of our country that we are ready to accept different aspects
 jaise aap north india main kisi se puuchhen ki kartikeya or ganesh main koun bade hai
 They will say Karthikeya
 lekin dakshin bharat main ganesh bade hai
 Karthikeya ji is considered Brahmachari in North while South is believed to have two wives
 ham log north ke rahane vaale hai, lekin south main kartikeya ji ke mandir main gaye to unki patniyon kii bhi puja kii
 So it is the specialty of our India that we are ready to accept different truths
 kuldeep: aap hameshaa hi libral approach ke lagate hai
 Have also seen your old interviews
 aap shikaayat bilkul bhi nahin karte
 Amish: The whole of India is of Liberal approach
 maine to swami vivekanand kii hi baat doharaai
 Kuldeep: Where is the Liberal? There are demonstrations against PK as well? Amish: i also wrote an article on 'PK' in a newspaper
 mujhe wo pikchar pasand nahin ai thi
 i wrote the first paragraph of that article that the film has every right to be displayed
 usee haq se maine apni baat likhi
 i felt that idol worship was being despised in the film
 jabaki mujhe lagata he ki murti puja to acchhee cheez he or yah hamaari udaartaa kii nishaani he
 If you see God in the idol, its 'root' is that he sees God in everything
 iskaa matlab he ki aap har cheez kii izzat karne ko taiyaar hai
 Kuldeep: How did you return to writing and faith from banking and atheism? How did this change, this transformation happen? Amish: It happened slowly
 jaise jaise main pehali kitaab likhata chalaa gaya, main aasthaa kii taraf waapas khinchataa chalaa gaya
 When i was a child i was a believer
 parivaar kaa maahaul hi dharmik tha
 My Baba was a Pandit in Benaras, you were right
 mere maa-baap bahut dharmik the
 i became an atheist for a few years
 meraa maananaa he ki agar main jaisaa insaan agar aasthaa kii taraf aa saktaa hum to koi bhi aa saktaa he
 Because i am a little Rebelius (rebel) type of man
 (amish ke 6 saal ke bete taiyaar hokar vahaan pahunchate hai
 Showing his new kurta pajama with his child-friendly boast
 ham ek pal ko ruk jate hai
 Amish says - Wow sir, you are looking very good
 phir amish baat ko aage badhaate hai
 )
 
 
 to ham jaise rebelius logon ke bhagwaan to shiv hi hai
 Kuldeep: So let me assume that when you write, you don't think about controversial things, because you think there will be no controversy
 amish:nahin main dil se likhata hum
 i believe that there is no clear mind
 lekin dil main khot ho to controvarsi nikal hi aati he
 You are from the media, believe it bad
 aap jaanate honge ki 99 fisadi controvarsi lekhak khud karte hai
 The sad thing is that the book also gets its benefit
 lekin main aastik hum, main jis ishwar ke bare main likhata hum, use puujata hum
 Controversy with him would be wrong to my heart
 kuldeep: ye ek shraddhalu kii taraf se likhi gai kitaab he yaa ek kissago kii taraf se yaa
 
 
 ? Amish: (cutting the question in the middle) from the devotee
 mujhe apane dharm par bahut garv he
 i say this again and again
 meraa maananaa he ki hamaari pracheen sabhyataa main bahut acchhee baaten hai, jinhen ham sikh sakate hai
 Like in the 18th chapter of Bhagavad Gita, Krishna Ji said that even if God says something, we should use our mind to do our own deeds
 kyonki karm kaa fal aapako hi milanaa he aapako hi sochna he ki aapkaa karm aapke swadharm ke anukool he yaa nahin
 According to me this is a good thing
 kuldeep: ram kisi ke liye maryaada purushottam hai, par kisi ke liye vivaadit kirdaar hai
 Those who consider Ram as a controversial character also have their own political line
 unka prachaar yah hota he ki unhone jo sita kii agnipariksha lee, vah ek mahilavirohi kadam tha
 Or was Shambook's 'slaughter' an anti-dalit work? What is your opinion on this? Amish: i will write an explanation of these incidents in my book
 lekin agar sita maa ke bare main kahuun to dedh saal pehle maine isi vishay par ek artical likhaa
 In it i wrote why i respect Shri Ram
 maine likhaa tha ki unhen maryaada purushottam kaha jaataa he
 What is the meaning of Maryada Purushottam, the 'model father of law'
 shriram kii kahani hamen yah sikhaati he ki bhai ek maryaada purushottam kii jindagi kisi hoti he
 Generally, such people do very well for the society they lead
 lekin unke paariwarik jivan main aam taur par kathinaaiyaan hoti hai
 i said that i should not only look at Shri Ram but also others, who used to follow dignity
 gautam buddha ko dekh lijie, unke falsafe se kitni shanti milti he
 But look at his family
 unhone apane parivaar ko tyaag diya
 When he came back, he flatly refused to accept Rahul as his son
 mahatma gandhi ko dekh lijie
 His relationships with his sons were not very good
 agar samaaj main kanoon kaa raaj hota he to samaaj ke liye acha hota he
 Love should rule in the family, not law
 ram ko bure rup main dekhnaa ek pahalu he
 The second aspect i will write in my book
 ram kii jindagi se yah seekhney ko miltaa he ki jo maryaada purushottam hote hai unki jindagi kisi hoti he
 There have also been leaders in our country who gave more importance to their family than law and country
 kah sakate hai ki ve leader shaayad leader achche nahin the, lekin mata pita achche the
 (read the names of Amish's favorite leaders on the next page) Kuldeep: Who are your favorite leaders? Amish: (says smiling) No i do not comment on politics
 maaf kiijie
 This is the way to stay away from control
 (phir ek tahaakaa kamare main goonjata he
 
 )kuldeep: jo ab nahin hai, unheen ke naam le lijie?amish:hamaare founding fadars main sab leaders achche the
 Sardar Patel, Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Drs
 ambedkar, moulana aaazaad, rajagopalchaari, subhash chandra bose, aravindo
 We were lucky nandlaal: in netaaon kii bhi alag alag vajah se aalochana hoti he
 Amish: i will not talk politically
 koi bhi leader insaan he
 Everyone has weaknesses
 desh kaa bhala hua ki nahin, bas vahi dekhnaa chahie
 Nandlal: Why did you choose Mythology to write? Kuldeep: Add to this that you could easily succeed by writing fiction like Chetan Bhagat, because it was the same type of writing
 lekin mithology kaa youth se conect nahin tha ab tak
 You chose the hard way amish:main kabhi lekhak bananaa hi nahin chahta tha
 i did not choose the path, the path chose me
 'hambal' parivaar se hum
 It is the blessing of the father and grandfather, not property, etc
 naukari acchhee thi meri
 Was also happy with the job
 lekin is kitaab kaa jab idia mujhe laga, 11-12 saal pehle to apane liye hi likh rahaa tha
 Then i did not even think that the book would come out
 apane or parivaar ke liye likh rahaa tha bas
 Probably without thinking, i was doing what our Krishna God says that Mafleshu Kadachan for Kamarnaya right
 'sayan of ikshvaku' bhi maine isi soch se likhi he
 My next book may not work
 to koi nahin, main waapas banking main chalaa jaaoongaa
 But i will do what my heart thinks is right
 agar sirf paisa kamanaa he to banking bhi koi bura jariya nahin he
 Kuldeep: i heard that you have a 20-year plan ready
 ram ke baad kya likh rahe hai
 Amish: Yes, if 5 books of Ram Ji will come, then it will be out in four to five years
 phir or bhi kai kahaniyaan hai, manu ke upar, brahma ji, parashuram ji or shri rudra or mohini par he
 One is on Mahabharata and all these stories are related to each other
 ramchandra siries ke baad aap shiv trilji dobaaraa padhein, to maine usamen kuch suraag chode hai ramchandra siries ke
 i have left the clues of Mahabharata, Parashurama and everyone's story in Shiva Trilji
 meri kahaniyaan mere dimag main 9 hajaar saal ke bich faili hui hai
 From 12 thousand years ago to 9 thousand years ago
 yah vaidic logon kii kahani he, manu ke saath samskruti ke janm or 3500 saal pehle samskruti ke khatme tak
 And we are his 'unworthy descendants'
 haa to likhata to main rahoonga agle 20-25 saal tak, koi padhe yaa na padhe
 If the books do not work, i will go into banking, but i will keep writing
 kuldeep: aapkaa riting pattern jaananaa chahta hum
 If i write, then i play music, i write in the morning or i write in the evening, take leave and write? Amish: No, i only write in the morning
 jaldi uth jaataa hum
 5: 30‚Äì6pm
 puja karata hum, eksrasij karata hum
 i read four newspapers
 phir 9-9:30 baje likhnaa shuru karata hum
 But i go with my whole heart while writing
 kuch din aise hote hai jab likhte hue shabd nahin aate
 Then i turn off the laptop
 par likhte samay mujhe mujeec kii jarurat padati he, to gaanaa hardam on rahata he
 And while writing, i eat a lot of cream biscuits
 nandlaal: aap yoga karte hai?amish:haa yoga karata hum
 i also exercise
 trainer ghar aata he
 Weight training etc
 kik boxing bhi
 Nandlal: The new generation likes Shiva very much
 unke tatu banaati he
 What do you think of Shiva? How to define them? Amish: It is very difficult to define them
 shivaji kaa mukhya aakarshan yah he ki bahut saare virodhabhas hai
 He is believed to live outside the society, but he is also the God of art, dance and music, the highest level of society
 ve bhasma apane badan par lagaate hai, bal aise hi chhod dete hai, lekin unhen saundaryeshwar bhi kaha jaataa he
 She is said to be recluse, stay away from Maya, but is also said to have a very good husband and father
 unke virodhabhas bahut aakarshak hote hai
 Their contradictions balance you
 vairaag yaa jimmedaari nibhaane, donon main se kisi kaa bhi atirek thik nahin he
 The balance between them is important
 haa, dhan ke peeche nahin bhaagna chahie varanaa vah aapako pagal kar degaa
 But it is also necessary to earn a little money for living, because there are responsibilities
 khud par apni sabhyataa-samaaj par garv hona chahie, lekin itnaa bhi nahin ki aap dusron se ghrinaa karne lagen
 This is the main attraction of Shiva, the contradictions that attract you and then balance you
 mere hisaab se duniya main sabase ahm cheez he balance
 Balance, balance yourself
 (agle pej par jaaniye, khud koun si kitaaben padhate hai amish)kuldeep: bharat main aapke fevorett lekhak koun se hai?amish:kuch kaa naam lenaa mushkil he
 i definitely read four to five books a month
 to pichley kuch dinon main jinako padhaa, wo bataata hum
 Dr

 There are very good books

 Read the book by Malayali writer MT Vasudevan Nair- 'bhima'
 mujhe acchhee lagi
 Kuldeep: Reads the kind of books that new people are writing
 jinhen chikalats kah dete hai log?amish:nahin main zyaadaatar non fiction padhata hum
 Nandlal: And writing is fiction! Amish: Yes, i am fiction
 virodhabhas ho gaya naa
 (laughter) Nandlal: Have you read the true Ramayana of Periyar? Amish: No, Nandlal: When you write the story of Manu, will you include the idea of dalits in it? Amish: Yes of course
 maine shiv trilji main bhi likhaa he
 In the olden days, man was ranked not on his birth, but on karma
 satyakam jawali rishi maane gaye hai, vah paidaayashi brahman nahin the
 But he was considered a great sage
 ram ji unase milane gaye, unase siikhaa bhi
 Valmiki, who wrote the Ramayana, and Krishna Dvaipayana (ved Vyas), who wrote the Mahabharata, were also not Padayashi Brahmins
 puraane jamaane main aapke janm kaa fark nahin padataa tha
 This thing ambedkar ne 'shudra koun the' main bhi kahi he
 What has happened has happened in the last 1500‚Äì2000 years
 puraane jamaane main genetic antarsampark (yon sandarbh main) bahut hota tha
 Kuldeep: How does the family react to this? a mythological passage at home? Amish: Yes, yes
 hamaare parivaar main shuru se aisa maahaul rahaa he
 There has been an atmosphere to tell such stories
 abhi to 6 saal kaa baccha he to vah kahaniyon ko taur par dekhtaa he

 Communist Party of india-marxist (CPI-M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Saturday accused the central government
 unhone khetibari ko vyavsaay banane or kisaanon kii vaazib shikayaton kaa jawaab goliyon se dene kaa aarope lagaaya
 Yechury wrote in a post on Facebook on Saturday about the farmers' movement in Madhya Pradesh, "the important thing is that we are not giving sufficient value to the farmers for their labor and produce
" bhaajapa iske sthaan par unki shikayaton kaa jawaab goliyon se de rahi he
 Please tell that in Madhya Pradesh, the farmers are agitating for the demand for loan waiver and reasonable price for the crop
 is dauraan police kii golibari main chah kisaanon kii maut ho chuki he
 Farming has become a loss-making profession, he said, adding that the minimum support price (MSP) is low and the Modi government has discontinued state-level bonuses
 bazaar mulya se kam emspi ke kaaran khetibari ek ghate vaala pesha ban gaya he
 Also, Yechury said that loan waiver of Kikisans is a temporary solution
 centre sarkaar ko emspi badhanaa chahie or saath hi rajyon ko bonus kii ghoshnaa karne kii anumati deni chahie
 Also, the government should purchase agricultural products
 kisaan jab utpaadan badha rahe hai, aise main sarkaar ko vyapaariyon ke liye keemat kam rakhane ke liye saste aayaat kii anumati nahin deni chahie
 This is an anti-farmer move

 These are the earliest lines of the poem 'sing' by the poet Trilochan
 vishwanath prasad treepathi ne kabhi kaha tha, 'trilochan hindi ke saubhaahgya hai
 The poet Trilochan was a prominent signature of the progressive poetry of Hindi literature
 vah aadhunik hindi kavita kii pragatisheel trayee ke teen stambhon main se ek the
 The other two pillars of this trilogy were Nagarjuna and Shamsher Bahadur Singh
 trilochan shastri kaa kavy-jivan lagbhag paanch dashakon ke lambey kaal main failaa hua he
 He is one of the most important poets of our time
 unki saamaajik chetana kaa falak itnaa vyapak he ki vaiyaktik dukh ko najar andaaj kar vah saamaajik dukh ko tarjeeh dete hai, par jab-tab unki yah tis ubhar aati he, or apane par bhi kavita likhane se vah chookte nahin
 Trilochan is a contrasting poet of unique talent
 trilochan kii kavitaayen samaaj ke sangharkshil vyakti kii kavitaayen hai, jinamein ek vicitra kism kaa virodhabhas dikhaai detaa he
 He was a master of Arabic and Persian languages apart from Hindi
 unki kavitaaon main gaanv kii dharti kaa oobadkhabadpan to he hi, kala kii drushti se ek adbhut clasiki kaa anushaasan bhi he
 The number of Trilochan's subjective poems is very large
 apane bare main hindi ke shaayad hi kisi kavi ne itane rangon main or itani kavitaayen likhi hon
 But the special thing is that these poems of Trilochan are not subjective or self-contained poems at any level
 trilochan shastri kii trilochan ke upar likhi kavitaaon kii chand panktiyon ko dekhte hai:'vahi trilochan he' kii chand panktiyaan hai-vahi trilochan he, vah-jis ke tan par gandekapade hai
 How clothes are torn too is fashion, they are cut from fashion
 koun kah sakegaa iskaa yah jivan chandepar avalambit he
 
 
 In the same way, the initial lines of 'seeing the same trilochan while begging are tomorrow' - i have seen the same trilochan while begging, i have understood the police, this is an ironman
 
 
 apane par hi likhi kavita 'trilochan chalata rahaa' kii aakhri panktiyon main vah khud par kataaksh karne se baj nahin aate
 The last few lines of this poem are:
 
 
 jaise pragatisheel kaviyon kii qui list nikali thior usamen trilochan kaa naam nahin thausi tarah is conductor kii bas menunaki seat nahin thisafar katataa rahatrilochan chalata rahaasangharsh ke tamaam nishaashapani baahon main sametebina baithetrilochan chalata rahaprem, prakruti, jivan-saundarya, jivan-sangharsh, manushyata ke vividh ayaamon ko samete hue trilochan kii kavitaaon kaa falak atyant vyapak he
 He is among the most important poets of the progressive poetry of Hindi
 bhashaa ke prati trilochan ek behad sajag kavi hai
 In Trilochan's poem, as easily as the unfamiliar words of the dialect come, at times, even the difficult words of Sanskrit make their place as easily
 trilochan kii sabase badi khaasiyat ek insaan ke rup main uske swabhimaan ke paksh main khadey rahanaa tha
 Trilochan never cheated anyone, nor did he lose even an inch from his self-respect
 unki kavitaaon main lok-jivan kii shashakt abhivyakti milti he
 In his famous poem titled 'I am the poet of that district', he writes: i am the poet of that district, who is hungry, naked, unknown, does not know art, what is it, he does not believe, Poetry can give anything
 pragatisheel dhara ke kavi hone ke kaaran trilochan marxvaadi chetana se sampann kavi the, lekin is chetana kaa upyog unhone apane dhang se kiya
 His poems do not speak of leftist ideology in the same way as the poems of Nagarjuna, Muktibodh, Dhumil or Kedarnath Agarwal
 trilochan ne lok bhashaa avadhi or pracheen sanskrit se prerana lee, isliye unki kavitaaon main iske shabd to hai hi, uski dhara badlaav, burjua or parampara kaa put liye hue he
 Being so closely connected with his tradition, he not only had the beauty of modernity, its elasticity and fragrance, but also had a trust in man's deeds and strength
 shaayad isiilie unamem apane vichaaron ko lekar koi badbolapan nahin aayaa
 a belief floated everywhere in his writing that only the public would play the revolutionary role of change
 unki ek kavita kii panktiyaan hai:abhi tumhaari shakti shesh hobhi tumhaari saans shesh hobhi tumhaara kaary shesh haimat alsaaomat chup baithotumhen pukaar rahaa he koyeebhi rakt rag-rag main chalataabhi gyaan kaa parichay miltaabhi na maran-priya nirbaltamat alsaaomat chup baithotumhen pukaar rahaa he koijankavi kaa tamgaa unhen yon hi nahin mila
 They do not use the language of credit, but rather the indigenous language in which the people of Hindi region speak
 trilochan kii kavita main tatsam shabdon ke saath tadbhav evam deshaj shabdon ke sateek prayog se rachana main betaratibi kii jagah ek prakaar kii vishistataa paidaa hoti he
 Trilochan gave him an Indian complexion, despite adopting a Western poetry like Saunet
 shaayad isiilie unki najar inasaanon ke sangharsh par hi nahin, unki swaarthee pravriti par bhi thi
 In the poem 'smell of man' he writes: When man needs man then
 zarurat hoti he, yani, koi kaam atakta he
 Then he gathers one or several men
 bina aadamiyon ke haath lagaae kisi kaa koi kaam nahin chalata
 Trilochan was bigger than any award
 unhen hindi academy ne shalaka sammaan se sammanit kiya tha
 He also received titles like 'shastri' and 'sahitya Ratna' for his outstanding contribution to Hindi literature
 'taap ke taae hue din' ke liye unhen sahitya academy kaa puraskaar bhi mila tha, to vah uttar pradesh hindi samiti puraskaar, hindi santhaan sammaan, maithilisharan gupt sammaan, shalaka sammaan, bhavani prasad mishra rashtriya puraskaar, sulabh sahitya academy sammaan, bhartiya bhashaa parishad sammaan aadi se bhi sammanit hue the
 But his real prize was the fans who have remembered him to this day
 maharashtra sarkaar ne doodh kii keemton main vruddhi karne kii ghoshnaa kii he
 The new rates will be effective from 16 February
 pashupaalan mantri madhukar chavaan ne kaha ki gaay ke doodh kii keemat main do rupee prati litre or bhens ke doodh kii keemat main dhai rupee prati litre kii vruddhi kii gai he

 uskaa to maano jivan dhanya ho jaataa he
 Devotion to Shri Hari can get rid of every sin and suffering
 lekin sawaal ye ki shri hari ko prasann kaise kiya jaae
 The Dharma texts and scriptures enumerate many divine mantras to get his grace to persuade Sri Hari and one of the most powerful and effective of these divine mantras is the mantra, which by chanting gives the infinite grace of Narayana
 narayan kaa divya mantra-shantakaaran bhujagashyann padmanabhan sureshan
 Vishvadharan Gaganasudrashna Meghvarna Shubhagamam
 
 Lakshmikantam Kamalanayanan Yogibhirdhyanagyam

 No obstacle can stop him nor can any calamity bother him
 to sachche man or puri shrriddha se narayan kaa mahaamantra japie
 The most welfare form of Narayana is Shaligram
 jyotishi kehete hai ki shaligram kii puja se jivan kii sabhi pareshaaniyon se mukti pai ja sakati he
 But first let us tell you how Srihari became Shaligramshri Hari, how Shaligram - Vrinda, the wife of a monster named Shankhachud was extremely Sati - it was impossible to defeat Shankhchud without dissolving her satti - Srihari changed the form of Vrinda's satti
 Dissolved - Then Shiva killed Shankhchud - Vrinda cursed Shree Hari to convert into Shila form for this trick - Shree Hari has been rocked since then
 They also live in the group and are called Shaligrams - Vrinda was reincarnated as Tulsi in the next life - Srihari blessed Vrinda that without Tulsi party, his worship would not be complete
 Shivalinga is worshiped as the Deity of the Lord - in the same way Shaligram is worshiped as the Deity of Lord Vishnu - Shaligram is a round black color c stone which is found in Gndki river in Nepal is that there is a hole And inside the stone are the conch, chakra, mace or padma carved- some stones have white round stripes similar to chakra- this stone is considered to be the form of Lord Vishnu- the blacker the shaligram the stone the more shapes on it They will be found to be equally excellent and effective
 Worship method of Shaligram - Anoint Shaligram Ji with water and panchamrit daily - offer sandalwood, five fruits or seasonal fruits Do- Offer Tulsi party, they cannot be worshiped without Tulsi party-if there are Saligrams in the house, then do not eat food without worshiping them - you should try to follow Vaishnav rules in the house if you stress i live in and there is no way to get out of it, then take shelter of Shri Hari
 The mace or Padma is carved- some stones have white round stripes similar to the chakra - this stone is considered as the form of Lord Vishnu - the blacker the Saligram stone and the more images it can be found on it, the better and effective
 Hogaligram worship method - Anoint Shaligram Ji with water and panchamrit daily - offer sandalwood, offer five fruits or Ritu fruits - Tulsi Dal must offer Tell them, they cannot be worshiped without a Tulsi party - if there are saligrams in the house, do not eat food without worshiping them - you should try to follow the Vaishnava rules in the house if you remain tense and get out of it
 If there is no way of seeing, then take shelter of Shri Hari

 shri hari ke ek mantra kaa jaap aapako tanaav se mukti dilaa saktaa he
 Vishnu Gayatri Mantra has been considered a great mantra to get the blessings of Lord Vishnu, because Lord Vishnu is one of the 24 deities of Jagatjanani Gayatri

 Reliance Jio se duusare network par colling ke paise lagenge
 Jio demands that TRAI zero out the interconnect charge
 airtel kaa kahana he ki TRAI jo charge le rahi he wo ab bhi kam he
 Indian telecom company Reliance Jio has announced that now Jio users will have to pay for calling on non-jio network
 har minute ke 6 paise tay kiye gaye hai
 The company has said that in lieu of 6 paise, Jio will give additional data to users
 non jeeyo kol ke dene honge paisagise se duusare network par colling - yani aapke paas jeeyo sim he or aap airtel, voda yaa edia par kol karte hai to aapako paise dene honge
 6 paise per minute
 haalanki jeeyo se jeeyo or jeeyo se landline colling ke liye koi paise nahin dene honge
 The company has introduced four vouchers from which Jio users will have to be recharged
 aapako bataa den ki ye vauchar aapke manthali plan ke baavjood karaane honge
 What is the rationale of Reliance Jio for taking money on calling? Reliance Jio has said that these money are being levied due to Interconnect Usage Charge which is the rule of TRAI
 aapako bataa den ki 2017 main TRAI ne IUC ko 14 paise se gata kar 6 paise kar diya tha
 Reliance Jio has also argued that the company has paid Rs 13500 crore to Airtel, Idea and Vodafone as IUC charges
 reliance jeeyo ne kaha he ki jab tak telecom regaulator athurity of india yani TRAI jiro termination charge kii vyavstha nahin lagu karti he, tab tak non jeeyo network par colling ke paise dene honge or vartmaan main ye taarikh 1 janvari 2020 tak kii he
 That is, Reliance Jio wants TRAI to eliminate the interconnect usage charge
 agar aisa hota he to jeeyo phir se yugers ke liye free kol kii suvidha shuru kar sakati he
 These are the four top ups that will have to be used and the free data will be available with them
 This top up voucher has been named IUC Top Up Voucher by Reliance Jio
 lekin aap isse kanphyus na hon, ye aam top ap jaisaa hi he
 --- In the top up of Rs 10, 124 non-live minutes will be given and 1GB data will be available with it
 --- 20 rupee ke top ap main 249 non jeeyo minute die jaaenge or iske saath company 2GB free data degi
 With a top up of Rs 50, you will be given 656 non-live minutes and with this you will get 5GB free data
 --- 100 rupee ke top ap ke saath aapako 1362 non jeeyo minutes milenge or iske saath aapako 10GB data free miligagauratlab he ki ye top ap vauchar aapke manthali plan ke alaava lagenge
 For example, if you use a monthly Jio plan of Rs 149, then for non-jio calling, you have to choose one of these four top ups
 Airtel kaa kya kahana he?bharat kii badi telecom company Airtel ne Jio ke is 6 pas colling charge par ek statement jari kiya he
 The company has said that on 19 September 2017, when TRAI reduced the IUC from 14 paise to 6 paise
 airtel TRAI ke IUC charge ke samarthan main dikhaai de rahi he
 Airtel says that the telecom industry has been in financial crisis in the last three years and due to this many operators have been bankrupted and thousands of jobs have also been lost
 interconect yuses charge cost par kol par tay kiya jaataa he
 The number of 2G customers in India is considerable and these 6 paise IUC calls are much less than the actual calls being a call completes

 At a function here on the occasion of the release of the book 'gujarat CAG Report: a Public Hearing of Discussion' from PUCL, Gujarat, Suresh said, "the way governments have been adopting attitude with the CAG report for the last several years This has necessitated giving more power to constitutional and statutory units

 BJP does not see success in Operation Lotus part-two at the moment
 bijepi kii koshish thi ki congress ke kam se kam 13 vidhayak istipha den, taaki bahumat kaa aankada kam ho or bijepi do nirdaleeyon kii madad se bahumat sabit kar sake
 It was being said that three angry Congress mlas staying in a five-star hotel in Mumbai may resign, but it did not happen till late in the night
 udhar congress ke gaayab paanch vidhayakon main se do waapas aa gaye hai
 Karnataka has 224 mlas
 mukhyamantri kumaraswami ko congress ke 80, janata dal secular ke 37 or bispi ke ek vidhayak kaa samarthan he
 He also has the support of a nominated MLA
 is tarah unke paas 119 vidhayak hai jo bahumat ke aankade 113 se zyada hai
 On the other hand, BJP has 104 mlas and it has 106 mlas including two independents
 bijepi ke oparation lotus part-2 main koshish he 13 congressi vidhayakon ke istife dilaane kii taaki bahumat kaa aankada ghatakar 106 rah jaae or bijepi sarkaar bana le
 Meanwhile, former Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa, bjp's chief ministerial candidate and mission Karnataka leader, has to return from Delhi to Bangalore
 aisa isliye kyonki unke guru tumkur swami kii haalat bighad gai he
 Although the BJP mlas who have been accommodated in the hotel in Gurugram have been asked to stay there right now, but there is a possibility that they will move one by one as soon as Yeddyurappa leaves
 udhar, congress ne apane vidhayakon kii ekajutata dikhaane ke liye shuukravaar ko bengalooru main vidhayak dal kii baithak bula lee he
 The Congress claims that all eighty mlas will be present in it
 uskaa aarope he ki yah piem modi or amit shah ke ishaare par ho rahaa he
 Chief Minister Kumaraswamy is in the midst of a rift between the Congress and the BJP
 kal unhone itmeenaan se apane bete kii film dekhi or aaj sarkari kaam nipataae
 They are aware that their hair is not going to be deterred in the fight between Congress and BJP
 haalat yahaan tak he ki bijepi kaa ek dhada chahta he ki bijepi janata dal secular ke saath haath mila le
 But Yeddyurappa remains a bottleneck in this
 rahaa sawaal bijepi alaakaman kaa to wo philhal khamosh he
 It was said that if a government is formed then it should be formed, but before this election, sabotage should not be done in such a way that the party has to face embarrassment
 lekin bijepi alaakaman ek baat jarur chahta he
 That is, Congress and JDS should not fight elections together
 yahi vajah he ki kumaraswami kii kursi ko philhal khatra nahin dikhataa, kyonki agar congress unke saath nahin rahegi to bijepi saath aane or samarthan dene ko taiyaar baithi he
 Overall, the drama of Karnataka seems to be overshadowing the BJP

 Because of this, he wanted to return to India, became very alone in America

 cricket, jo himmat-hausalon or pratispardhaa-bhaawanaaon kaa khel he lekin cricket ke kalankon ne ise kisi laayak nahin choda
 Cricketers sold the ball for it, the umpire put the sentiments of the Indians echoing in the stadium with every ball, and the rest was accounted for by the team owner and the board

 ipel main ab phixing-sattebaaji ke alaava bachaa kya? kuch bhi nahin
 The IPL is all black behind its colors and shine
 chhakkon-chaukon kii is bauchhaar ke peeche bahut bada fareb he
 There is a mess of conspiracy at the footsteps of the IPL
 hindustan ke is junun ke peeche phixing kaa bahut bada ghotaalaa he
 With the new revelations happening everyday, the brightness of the IPL is getting worse and worse
 hajaaron rupye kharch kar stadium pahunchane vaale cricket premiyon kaa dil nahin maanegaa lekin yahi sach he
 In this game, there is nothing but infamy
 is khel main hindustaniyon kii bhaawanaaon se khilwaad ke sivaa kuch bhi nahin
 The glitter of IPL season-6 was first marked by Sreesanth, Ajit Chandila, Ankit Chavan
 lekin uske baad to daag lagate hi gaye, ipel phixing kii kai dinon kii chanj ke baad khulaason ke itane daag lag chuke hai ki ipel kaa puraa daaman hi kaala pad chukaa he
 The stigma of fixing and betting in the IPL from cricket players reached Bollywood
 bollywood se kalank ke taar anderworld tak pahunche or ab to ampire se lekar team ke siio tak sawaalon ke ghere main hai
 n Srinivasan is the BCCI President, without a hint of cricket in the country, a leaf cannot move but his grandfather Gurunath Meiyappan is the only betting question
 gurunath mayppan jo ipel kii chennai team ke siio bhi hai, bataaya ja rahaa he ki na sirf wo sattebaaji ke shaukeen rahe hai balki ipel sijan-6 main wo kareeb 1 karod kaa nuksaan bhi uthaa chuke hai
 The umpire, who played the ball at his fingertips on the ground of the attack on Pakistani umpire Asad Rauf, did not refrain from accusing cricket
 sawaalon ke ghere main hai pakistani ampire asad rauf
 And you will be surprised to hear the latest revelations
 do modells se poochtacha main jaankaree mili he ki sattebaaji ke aarope main giraftaar tivi kalakaar vindu daara singh bookies or khilaadiyon ko ladkiyaan bhi supplai kiya karte the
 So the question is, what is left in this stigma of cricket and who is left? If the players are fixed then the CEO of the team is fixed, the umpires are fixed then the ball-ball is fixed
 to kya ye kahana thik nahin hoga ki ipel main ol ij phixd!vindu se poochtacha ke baad kai bade khulaaseipel phixing or sattebaaji main har roj hote khulaase josh or junun ke cricket ko or gart main dhakelte ja rahe hai
 Vindu Dara Singh, who has been killed by the Mumbai Police, has revealed some more names
 vindu daara singh ne harbhajan singh (bhajji) or chennai super kings ke 3 cricketron se acchhee jaan pahchaan kii baat kabuuli he
 Now the investigating agencies are trying to find out what is the extent of Vindu's life identity? However, the Crime Branch of Mumbai Police itself says that acquaintance with Vindu does not mean that these four players also have relationships with betting or fixing
 lekin mumbai police kii agali daleel par bhi aapako gaur karnaa hoga
 The Mumbai Police has said, 'their role will be investigated
 'harbhajan singh samet 4 cricketron kaa naam uchhalaipiel main spot phixing kii jaanch kaa dayera badhata hi ja rahaa he
 According to sources, some other players may get caught in this fixing trap soon
 sutron kii maane to chennai super kings ke teen khilaadiyon se vindu ke kareebi rishte hai
 Not only this, he has also been seen with Harbhajan Singh
 lekin abhi tak in khilaadiyon ke phixing ke khel main shaamil hone ke saboot nahin mili hai
 Mumbai Crime Branch is constantly questioning Vindu
 is maamle main buudhvaar ko krime branch kii do modells se poochtacha main ye baat bhi saamne ai he ki vindu satta lagane ke saath saath bookies or khilaadiyon ko ladkiyaan bhi supplai karte the
 Shocking Revelations by the Models There have also been shocking revelations in the interrogation of two models
 modells ne poochtacha main mumbai police kii krime branch ke saamne is baat kii pushti kii he ki pakistani ampire asad rauf sattebaaji main giraftaar vindu daara sihan or kuch sattebaajon ke sampark main the
 It has also been revealed by quoting the models that girls were also supplied to Rauf
 lekin modells se poochtacha kaa sabase bada khulaasa ye he ki tivi kalakaar vindu daara singh khud bhi bookies or cricket khilaadiyon ko ladkiyaan supplai kiya karte the
 What happened so far in the fixing scandal? 
 
 pehle cricketer srisanth, chandila or chavaan kii giraftaar
 Then BCCI President n Srinivasan's son-in-law and Chennai Super Kigs CEO Gurunath Meiyappan was surrounded by questions
 or ab cricket ke maidan main har gend ko apni ungaliyon ke ishaare par nachaane vaale pakistani ampire asad rauf par sattebaaji ke sarganaon se sidhe sampark ke iljaam
 After all, who saved from the stigma of cricket? In the greed of thick pieces of notes, the cricketer fixed the betting and the umpire was also fixed in betting on the issue of betting, and on whose trust Hindustan left the entire coronation of cricket - son of that BCCI president and CEO of Chennai team Gurunath Meiyappan K's feet are also trapped deep in the betting marshes that taint cricket
 bas aap phixing or sattebaaji se jude khulaason ke is bavandar main itnaa samajhane kii koshish kijie ki kis-kis ke daaman kanlak ke daag se bache rah pate hai
 What does it mean, did Vindu Dara Singh have anything to do with betting and fixing players? Was there any black game of Vindu through the four IPL players whom Vindu confessed to? apni tarah kii pehali ghatana main ek yachikakarta ne sunwaayee ke liye ek ghante kaa samay die jane kii maang karte hue bombay ucch nyaayalay ko 20 hajaar rupee kaa check bheja he

 unhone kaha ki yadi tilotakar maafee nahin maangata he to uske khilaaf avmaananaa karrwai kii ja sakati he
 Tilotkar apologized verbally, stating that he was unaware of the law and wrote the letter in ignorance and sent the check

 The 2014-15 Economic Survey has announced India's arrival at a point from which it can move towards double-digit growth
 isse na sirf har aankh se aansu poncha jayega balki yuva, madhyamvargeey or mahatvakanjhi bharat ke liye avasar paidaa honge, jisase ve aseemit kshamta ko saakaar kar sakenge
 This review of two volumes has been prepared by experts outside the government and outside the government
 is par mukhya aarthik salaahkaar arvind subrahmanyan kaa dastakhat he
 It has been written in the introduction that the path of double digit growth is open because facts and fate are in India's favor
 arthvyavastha sthir ho gai he, sudhaaron kii shuruyaat ho gai he, vikaas main giravat khatm ho gai he
 That is, India is now ready to move forward
 aaj kaa bharat sankatagrast nahin he
 He came out of the crisis, but have we overcome the crisis in the backdate
 jidipi kii ginati kaa paimaana badal gaya he
 According to this, India is also 6 in those three years
 9 pratishat kii dar se tarakkee kar rahaa tha jab 5 pratishat se neeche aa jane kii baat ho rahi thi
 7 in 2013‚Äì14
 2 pratishat ke aas paas rahi he
 Now the government is claiming that it will achieve 8 percent GDP at market price in 2015-16
 ab yah kamaal jidipi kii ginati main badlaav se hua he yaa vaaki hamaari arthvyavastha pichley do saal se behatar pradarshan kar rahi he
 At the end of January, the government brought the GDP fixing scale to an international level
 abhi tak 2004-05 saal ke bazaar dar ke aadhaar par jidipi tay hoti thi, lekin ab 2011-12 ke aadhaar par hogi
 This brings the GDP to 7 percent in 2013-14
 lekin kya isse hamaari arthvyavastha kaa aakaar bhi badha
 Statistics say that did not increase
 kya manuphaccharing, udyog, rojgaar niryaat in sabamein bhi vruddhi hui
 In the Mint newspaper, Manas Chakraborty wrote that if the economy has become better then why are we expecting the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates
 sarkaar kaa rajkoshiya ghaataa 4
 Why only 6 percent is left
 iconomik times main abhik burman ne blog likhaa he ki aarthik survey main jo daawey kiye gaye hai vah hakeekat nahin he
 It is not right to blame on labor reforms or land reforms, as the Government of India is the largest landowner
 raksha or railway ke paas itani zamin he ki unke kuch hisson par udyog jagat ko udyog lagane yaa dukaane kholane ke liye bulaayaa ja saktaa he
 The project says that large infrastructure projects are stalled
 vah pandrah saal se ruke pade hai
 The capital trapped in these is 7 to 8 percent of GDP, which is a very large amount
 sirf yah kah dena ki laal fitaashahee hataa di, yaa clearence lenaa aasaan kar diya isse saare project chal padenge sthiti kaa sahi moolyankan nahin he
 Most project costs have increased manifold due to several reasons
 companiyaan bank log chukaane kii sthiti main nahin he or agar sarkaar ne ye bharpai bainkon ko paise dekar kii to jo bhi puunji ai he vah zamin par utarane se pehle hawa ho jaaegi
 The Economic Survey has said that about nine lakh crore schemes have been hanging, but in December, in the mid-term review, the same Arvind Subramanian Sahab said that the schemes worth 18 lakh crore have been stuck
 do maheene main itnaa antar kaise aa gaya
 Now come what the survey has said on the subsidy
 arvind subramanyan likhte hai ki sabsidi kaa laabh garib ko kam amir ko zyada miltaa he
 Subsidies reduce productivity and often the poor and weaker sections are the most hurt
 survey main kaha gaya he ki sabase zyada licage gehun or chaaval par di jane vaali sabsidi main he
 On these two, the government gives a subsidy of 1
25 lakh crore
 gehun or chaaval par nunatam samarthan mulya zyada dene se kisaan duusari fasal nahin ugaate
 This causes the price of wheat rice to fall and the prices of other crops rise
 nateeja mahangaai bad jaati he or garib phir prabhavit hota he
 The government did not say that the subsidy that would affect the poor would end, but would like to meet the target of giving cash to everyone's account to prevent leakages
 survey main daawa he ki agar licage kam kar den to sabsidi kaa laabh zyada pahonchega
 But the survey also said that there is no benefit from subsidies
 ulta garib or garib hote he
 Now, MNREGA and institutions working on social security schemes have become concerned
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki manaregaa upie kii naakaami kaa smarak he
 He will not stop it, but will tell the people by roaming that the Congress has dug the pit
 manaregaa par kaam karne vaali reetika kheda kahati hai ki yah sahi dharna nahin he
 Roads have been built in many places, wells have been dug, small water dams have been constructed, ponds have also been constructed
 ise dekhne ke najariye kaa bhi sawaal aata he
 The paved road in the city is repaired ten times in a year, does the raw road need to be filled two or three times
 zamin ko samtal karne kaa kaam bekaar nahin hota, isse bahut si zamin kheti yogya bani he
 Ritika said that the first objective of MNREGA is that people who do not have work and do not have the skills to work, get work and some cash
 isliye is yojana main 60 pratishat hissaa mazaduri kaa he
 Anyway, the amount of MNREGA has come down from 54,000 crores to 33,000 crores in the last three years
 cash transfar yojana ke bare main ek duusari raay aa rahi he
 The scheme has not yet been implemented in Delhi in an effective manner
 aaj hi hridayesh joshi ne khabar dikhaai he ki kaise un garib logon ko rashan kaa anaaj nahin mil rahaa he, jinke paas aadhaar card nahin he
 While the Supreme Court has said that ration card should be made even if there is no Aadhar card
 cash transfar kuch yojanaon main to behatar bataai ja rahi he, lekin khaadya suraksha ke bare main alag raay he
 Hridayesh Joshi also showed you in this report
 usee tarah bijness standard main nitin sethi kii report chhapi he ki madhya pradesh, odisha or tamilnadu jaise rajyon ne cash transfar par aapatti jataai he
 That is because the ration shop is in every village, but the banks are far away
 sarkaar rashan kii dukaanon par apane kharche se anaaj pahunchaati he
 The government will be saved from that expenditure, but the common poor people will be burdened with that
 saath hi saaf nahin he ki bazaar main jab anaaj ke daam badhenge to kya hoga
 In every state there is a considerable difference in the prices of grains in local markets
 to agar ham 7 pratishat vaali jidipi ho chuke hai to kya mumkin he ki arun jetali ke bajet main khushiyon kii bauchhaar hone vaali he
 Operation Blue Star was the bloodiest battle in the history of civil strife in independent India
 amritsar sthit swarna mandir ke paas apane hathiyaarband saathiyon ke ghere main chhipe baithe bhindrawaale or uski choti-si tukdi ko kaabo karne ke liye sena ne abhiyaan chalaaya

 He was shot by two Sikh bodyguards on 31 October of the same year
 uske baad desh bhar mengussai bheedane 8,000 se zyada sikhon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya
 Three thousand of them died in Delhi only
 is sampradayik sanhaar ne punjab main or ek dashak ke liye vidroh kii aag ko hawa di
 According to a World Bank report 2 in the future India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by increasing temperature and changes in monsoon rainfall pattern due to climate change
 8 fisadi kii giravat aa sakati he
 This report says that climate change will have the highest impact on the states falling on the Tropic of Cancer in India
 india today ke kaarykram state of state main india today hindi magazine ke sampadak anshuman tiwari se baatcheet ke dauraan chhattisgarh ke krishi mantri vrajamohan agarwal ne kaha ki iskaa koi bhi prabhaav rajya par nahin padegaa, kyonki chhattisgarh ke paas 42 pratishat van kshetra he
 At the same time, the state government is planting ten crore trees every year
 brijmohan agarwal ne yah bhi kaha ki ye to waisi hi baat ho gai ki america guobal varming ke liye sabase zyada jimmedaar he, lekin isaki keemat har desh se chahta he
 This World Bank report states that India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka will be adversely affected by these changes, while Afghanistan and Nepal will benefit from it as they are relatively cold
 report main is baat kii chetavanee di gai he ki isse bharat main lagbhag 60 karod logon ke rahan-sahan ke str main badi giravat aa sakati he
 Congress general secretary Jyotiraditya Scindia said that in the last four and a half years, things like mob lynchings in India, which few people heard about, are now heard by people everyday
 sindhiya ne baaten india today conklev ke 18wein sanskaran ke ek satr main boli
 On the comparison of the Modi government with the UPA-2 government led by Manmohan Singh, Jyotiraditya Scindia said that an atmosphere of intolerance has been created in the Modi government
 mob linching jaise maamalon par baat karte hue sindhiya ne kaha ki modi sarkaar main ashishnutaa bad gai he
 See where we have reached
 congress saansad ne kaha ki manmohan singh kii sarkaar main aise maamle nahin hue the
 Four and a half years ago no one used to count who went to which temple, but today such things are counted
 tab mudde alag the
 He did not fulfill the promises made by Narendra Modi in 2014
 unhone aage kaha ki do tarah ke netaa hote hai ek wo jo vaayade zyada karte he lekin nibhaate kam hai or doosraa jo vaayade kam karte hai, lekin kaam zyada karte hai
 i believe in another type of leader
 'hamaare liye aatank kii ladaai pehle'congress saansad ne kaha ki hamaare liye aatanki kii ladaai pehle he
 There is no BJP or Congress for us
 pulavama ke baad ke ghatnakram par bijepi netaaon or karnataka ke purv mukhyamantri bies yeddiurappa ke bayaan se spasht he ki bijepi javaanon ke shaury kaa raajnneetik phayda uthaanaa chaahati he
 It should be strongly condemned
 sindhiya ne kaha ki balakot main airstrike ko lekar hamane javaanon ko badhai di
 On the one hand, Air Force wing commander Abhinandan was in the possession of present-day Pakistan and BJP leaders were holding an election rally
 unhone poocha ki kya is dauraan chunavi kaarykram radd nahin kiye jane chahie the
 We have done this
 yahaan par bijepi or congress nahin he
 India is first here
 dilli kii AAP sarkaar kaa pehla 'janata darbar' shuukravaar ko badintjami ke chalate flop ho gaya
 Thousands of people gathered in front of Delhi Secretariat broke the barricades, after which there was a huge panic
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko aanan-fanan main vahaan se nikalnaa padaa
 Arvind admitted that his arrangements were not perfect and that this mistake would have to be rectified next time
 unhone kaha ki bahut saare log unhen badhai dene or haath milaane ke icchhuk the
 If she did not leave immediately, there could be a stampede
 unhone kaha, 'log bekaabu ho gaye the
 Today there was a storm
 meri teble par bhi log chadh gaye
 Kejriwal said that he will have a detailed discussion with the authorities on the arrangements of the Janata Darbar and the place will also be changed if the need arises
 lekin halaat kuch thik hone ke baad kejariwal apane mantriyon ke saath dobaaraa logon ko sambodhit karne pahunch gaye
 He said that at present, the security arrangements are not such that public hearing can be continued
 agali baar behatar intjaam karenge
 Therefore, the next public hearing will be held on Wednesday
 kejariwal ne kaha ki is baar unhone jitne logon kii samasyaayein sunin, unamem zyaadaatar theke par kaam kar rahe karmchaaree the
 Like a clever leader, Kejriwal announced that he would write a letter to all the departments asking him what is the problem of permitting the contract workers
 jawaab ke liye vibhaagon ko ek hafte kaa samay diya jayega or ek maheene main is par thos faisla liya jayega
 Arvind said, 'next time when we will listen, my request is that the contract workers should not come
 aapse hamane ek hafte kaa vakt liya he
 We want to hear more and more people's problems
 ' iske baad 'bharat mata kii jai' ke naare ke saath yah jaidaalat khatm ho gai
 Earlier this morning, which started at 9:30 am, a large number of people had reached the Janata Durbar with their problems
 logon suraksha gheraa tod diya jiske baad maahaul puri tarah se bighad gaya

 com / r3vh3uzdsz anderworld don chota rajan ke kareebi sahyogiyon ne hi use dhokhaa diya
 It was his cook Mitwa who told d Company about his whereabouts
 jisaki vajah se isi saal july main sidney ke ek cafe main us par hamalaa hua tha
 But Rajan somehow managed to escape from there
 magar is hamale ke baad chota rajan ko is baat kaa ahsaas ho gaya tha ki ab use or bhaagna nahin chahie
 This was revealed by two of Don's colleagues in a phone conversation with our affiliate newspaper Mail Today
 interpol ke red corner notice par karrwai karte hueaustralian or indonesian polisaki ek sanyukt team ne bali main ravivaar ko chota rajan ko giraftaar kar liya
 In this way the two-decade long race of legal and enforcement agencies also came to an end
 rajan 20 se adhik hatya ke maamalon main vaanchit he
 Officials said that 55-year-old Rajendra Sadashiv Nakaje alias Mohan Kumar alias Chhota Rajan was arrested when he reached the Indonesian city of Bali from Sydney, based on a tip-off received by the Australian police
 rajan kai varshon se australia main chipa hua tha
 Gangster Chhota Shakeel was working on a plan to eliminate Chhota Rajanco at the behest of his boss Dawood Ibrahim
 kyonki daaud ko is baat kii ashanka thi ki rajan bhartiya suraksha agenciyon ko bahut si jaankaree de rahaa tha
 Shakeel had also carried out the attack on Rajan in Sydney
 kabhi daaud kaa kareebi rahaa chota rajan 1993 ke mumbai visphoton ke baad usase alag ho gaya tha or tabhi se vah uskaa dushman ban gaya tha
 Chhota Rajan's gang members told Mail Today over phone that Rajan's close aides, brothers Ravi and Vimal, leaked information about him
 yah donon hi rajan ke hawala kaarobaar ko chalaa rahe the
 Ravi and Vimal, who live in Chembur, Mumbai, want to build a hotel in Dubai and Chhota Shakeel assured them to help them open a hotel there
 isliye ve rajan ke bare main jaankaree li kar rahe the
 Due to this, his cook Mitwa had told the address of the cafe to the enemies where Rajan would visit once a week
 khufia agenciyon ke sutron ne bhi is baat kii pushti kii he
 Two gang members have claimed that Bala Shetty, close to Shakeel, carried out the July attack
 unhone mail today ko bataaya ki ravi, vimal or mitawa ne hi skip ke jariye shetty ko rajan kaa naveenatam tasviren bheji thi
 Vimal was last seen near the Ireland border
 sibiai ne chota rajan ke khilaaf maamalon kii jaanch kar rahi mumbai police ke anurodh par hi july 1995 main rajan ke khilaaf red corner notice jari kiya tha
 According to information received by Mail Today from close associates of the Chhota Rajan gang, Rajan began to decline due to not working properly for his special people
 vah bhaagate bhaagate biimaar ho gaya tha
 India always wanted to capture him for important information
 taaki vah daaud or uske giroh par dabaav bana sake
 We all used to work for Jai Hind (chhota Rajan gang)
 lekin paisa rajan kii kamajori thi
 He never paid full money to anyone for work
 jiske chalate uske giroh main daraar pad gai
 And because of this the gang was weakened
 uske baavjood ravi or vimal rajan ke sabase kareeb the
 Vimal was also behind Dawood's murder of Sharad Shetty
 chota rajan giroh ke sadasyon se mail today ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik ravi or vimal ne chota shakeel ke kareebi shetty kii hatya karke chota rajan par hue hamale kaa badla liya tha
 The plot to attack Rajan in Bangkok in 2000 was hatched in Shetty's house in Dubai
 pizza delivery bvoy banakar aae daaud ke logon ne us par kai baar goli chalaai thi lekin iske baavjood rajan batch gaya tha
 In 2003, Sharad Shetty was killed by Chhota Rajan's men in broad daylight firing at a club in Dubai
 suraksha agenciyon ne daawa kiya he ki rajan ko aage kii poochtacha ke liye jald hi bharat waapas laayaa jayega

 However, now the Congress Screening Committee is deciding candidates on 403 seats under Plan B

 police main shikaayat karne par bhi koi karrwai nahin kii jaati thi
 One such person was Gora Singh
 use maarane se pehle hi uski chita taiyaar kar di gai thi
 Then she was shot and thrown on the pyre and her pyre was set on fire
 jab uske bade bhai ne is baat kaa virodh kiya to mahangi gaadi dekar uskaa munh band karvaa diya gaya
 Now Gora Singh's elder brother works as a manager in the dera
 agar koi shaks ram rahim kaa koi raaj jaan jaataa tha to uski maut tay thi
 Khattar Singh claims that if the camp is excavated, he will find heaps of human skeletons
 yahaan tak ki dere ke andar kai khatarnaak hathiyaar or ardex tak maujuud he
 Most of the property of Sirsa Dera is made from black money and that black money was made white by making films
 khulaasa huahai ki gurmeet ram rahim sex power badhaane ke liye khaas taur par sone-chaandi se yukt dawaai banavaata tha
 If a girl became pregnant after sex, then she was administered in the hospital of the camp
 iske saath hi sadhviyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue dere ke ladkon ko napunsak bhi banaaya jaataa tha
 So far, about 500 people have been impotent in the camp
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main bhartiya janata party ko mili jeet ke baad ek baar iviem kaa jinn baahar aa gaya he
 Patidar leader Hardik Patel had already accused the EVM of disturbances even before the election results, but after the result, the Congress was also seen going in the same direction
 haalanki, aisa pehla mauka nahin jab iviem par sawaal uthaae gaye hon
 Earlier, when the BJP got a bumper victory in the UP assembly elections held in March this year, the issue of evms got hot
 behad kharaab pradarshan karne vaali bispi supremeo mayawati ne nateezon ke tatkaal baad hi iviem kii vishwasaneeyata par sawaal uthaate hue bijepi par gadabadi kaa aarope laga diya
 After BSP supremo, Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal and Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav also questioned the evms
 jiske baad congress sahit vibhinn raajnneetik dalon ne EVM kii karypranali par sawaal uthaae
 Even a congressional delegation met the President regarding the EVM hack case
 dilli vidhansabha main demservind kejariwal or aam aadmi party ne iviem main gadabadi ko bada mudda banaaya
 His party MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj gave a demo of how evms can be hacked inside the assembly
 jiske baad chunaav ayog ne unki iviem hack karne kii chunauti tak de daali
 The workshop was held in 2004, even before this, the Election Commission took an initiative in this direction
 2004 main chunaav ayog ne ek workshop yojit kii thi or usamen koi iviem ko hack yaa temper nahin kar paaya tha
 But even then many veterans, including BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani, questioned the credibility of evms after losing elections badly
 chunaav ayog ne bataaya tha ki 2009 main bhi iviem kii vishwasniyata par sawaal uthaae jane ke baad ayog kii taraf se khulaa chalange diya gaya tha, lekin koi ise sabit nahin kar sakaa
 Now Patidar leader Hardik Patel has accused the BJP of hacking
 unhone yahaan tak kah daalaa ki bijepi ne iviem hekking ke liye ejeeniyar bulaae hai
 evms are being replaced, however, when evms became a big issue after the election earlier this year, the government also came into action
 ayog ne saal 2006 se pehle kharidi gai 9,30,430 iviem badalane kaa faisla kiya he, kyonki puraani mashiinon kaa 15 saal kaa jeevankaal puraa ho chukaa he
 After which the government has also taken a step in this direction
 kanoon mantralay ne nirvachan ayog kii ore se sansad ko uplabdh karwaai jane vaali jaankaree ke hawaale se kaha ki nai mashine kharidne ke liye lagbhag 1940 karod rupee (malbhaadaa or tex chhodkar) kaa kharch aayega
 These machines can come in the year 2018 i

 a militant was killed in an encounter between paramilitary personnel and heavily armed militants in Manipur
 police ne bataaya ki javaanon ke saath yah muthbhed myamar seemaa se satee manipur ke chandel jile main hui
 a senior police officer said that the encounter took place at around 5 am in Chamol village, about 18 km from Chakpikrang police station

 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar siyaasi ghamaasan tej ho gaya he, lekin patidaar netaaon or congress ke bich baat banati najar nahin aa rahi he
 When the Patidar Reservation Movement Committee (PAAS) leaders reached Delhi on Friday, it was expected that after talks with the Congress, the picture would be clear whether the Patidar leaders would support the Congress or not
 haalanki shaam hote-hote patidaar netaaon ne bayaan diya ki wo congress ko 24 ghante kaa ultimatum de rahe hai
 In fact, PAAS leaders also allege that Gujarat Congress President Bharat Singh had called him to Delhi in the name of meeting the High Command, but far from being called, he is missing himself and is not picking up the phone
 patidaar netaaon ne kaha ki shuukravaar ko pura din bharat singh ne unako dilli sthit gujarat bhawan main bithaae rakhaa
 Due to this, Patidar leader Dinesh Bamania, who arrived for the meeting of the Patidar Reservation Movement Committee, said that Kikangres has been given a 24-hour ultimatum
 unhone kaha ki ab 24 ghante main congress apana rukh saaf kare
 Bamnia said the Congress is joking with the Patidars
 vahiin, congress pravaktaa manish doshi ne ajtak se phone par baatcheet main kaha ki communication gap ki vajah se hua aisa hua he
 The Congress is ready to negotiate with the Patidars in every way
 congress agle 24 ghante main sabhi manmutav ko mitaane kii puri koshish karegi
 On the other hand, Gujarat Deputy CM Nitin Patel said that PAAS and Congress are using each other for their own meaning
 congress patidaar kaa istemaal kar rahi he or PAAS ke netaa isliye dilli gaye, kyonki unako congress ke tikat chahie
 They want to pressurize the Congress and get tickets

 By saying this, Advani has again raised controversy over the bjp's PM candidate
 adwani ne enditivi kii barkhaa dutt se exclusive baatcheet main yah baat kahi
 Advani also said that in 2009, the party made him the candidate for the post of PM
 unhone kaha, mujhe nahin pataa aglaa chunaav kab hoga, lekin main khud ko feet rakh rahaa hum
 At the same time, Uma Bharti, who recently returned to BJP, described LK Advani as the bjp's PM candidate
 aaj ek raily main uma bharti ne kaha ki banaras se jo bhi bhrashtachar ke khilaaf abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karata he, vah piem jarur banataa he
 Uma Bharti also gave the example of Vishwanath Pratap Singh

 Former Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Pravin Togadia on Tuesday targeted the Modi government at the center
 togadiya ne lagaaya ki sarkaar ne ayodhya, kaashi or mathura main mandir nirmaan ke liye kanoon nahin banaaya
 At a press conference in Lucknow, Togadia said that the Modi government has not done anything yet to build the temple in Ayodhya
 centre kii bijepi sarkaar ne ayodhya, kaashi or mathura main mandir nirmaan ke liye kanoon naa banaakar karodon hinduon ke saath chal kiya he
 Togadia, who has formed a new organization called the International Hindu Council, said that he himself has drafted a law related to the Ram temple
 lekin sarkaar anya kaaryon main bahut vyast he isaliye use is kanoon ko sansad main paarit karana chaiye
 Praveen Togadia said that today he will go to Ayodhya and put this draft in Ramlala's feet
 oktober main vah or unke sanghathan ke log lakhanu se ayodhya tak ‚Äòayodhya march‚Äò nikaalenge
 Togadia said that a voice will be raised on behalf of the public for the construction of Ram temple
 vah mandir nirmaan ke masaude par hastakshar abhiyaan ke tahat 20 karod hinduon kaa samarthan hasil karenge
 According to Togadia, after this the draft will be sent to the Modi government so that it can be passed in Parliament
 unhone kaha ki hamen ‚Äòsabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas‚Äò par vishwaas nahin he balki ‚Äòhindu vikaas‚Äò hi hamaara naaraa he
 Togadia said that the team of his organization is new but the attitude is the same
 yah sanghathan desh-videsh kii sabhi jatiyon, vyavsaayon, bhashaaon, rajyon, panthon or ling ke hinduon ke dharmik, saamaajik, aarthik, saanskrithik orraajnneetik adhikaronke liye kaam karegaa
 Who is Praveen Togadia, who joined Praveen Togadia VHP in 1983 at just 27 years of age
 ram mandir andolan main unki sakriy bhoomika dekhte hue unhen viechpi kaa mahasachiv banaaya gaya or ashok singhl ke dehanth ko baad togadiya viechpi ke adhyaksh bane the
 Now retired Justice VS Kokje has been appointed as the new President of Vishwa Hindu Parishad in place of Togadia
 uttar pradesh kaa mukhyamantri banate hi yogi adityanath ne daawa kiya tha ki vah 15 june 2017 tak pradesh kii sabhi sadakon ko gaddha mukt kara denge
 But statistics show that potholes could not be filled on the roads and the highest number of deaths due to this occurred in UP
 ek report ke anusaar beete varsh upi main 987 logon kii jaan sadak par gaddhon kii vajah se hue haadason main chali gayi, jo desh main sabase adhik he
 a Times of India report states that the roads that have been converted into pits are proving fatal
 alam yah he ki gat varsh 2017 main in gaddhon ne 3,597 logon kii jaan le lee
 In our country, due to the pits, on an average, 10 lives are lost every day
 2016 ke mukaable dekha jaae to ek saal main yah aankada 50 fisadi tak bad gaya he
 In the year 2017, 726 people lost their lives in Maharashtra due to potholes
 2016 kii tulana main maharashtra main gaddhon ke chalate hone vaali mauton kaa yah aankada doguna rahaa
 The severity of deaths due to road accidents can be understood from the fact that in 2017, there were 803 deaths in Naxalite and terrorist incidents in the country, including terrorists, security personnel and civilians
 sadak par gaddhon ke chalate hone vaali mauton ne phir is bahes ko taaja kar diya he ki nagar nikaayon or sadak swaamitv vaali agenciyon main bhrashtachar in gaddhon ke hone kii ek badi vajah he
 Apart from this, the attitude of the passengers who do not follow the traffic rules on the road and not wearing the helmet of most two-wheelers is also the main reason for these deaths
 sabase zyada mautein upi mensadak haadason kii vajah se hui mauton ke in aankadon ko sabhi rajyon ne centre sarkaar ke saath saajha kiya he
 These figures reveal that Uttar Pradesh had the highest number of deaths of 987 people due to the pits
 is maamle main upi ke baad sabase zyada kharaab record haryana or gujarat kaa he
 In Delhi, eight people died due to pits in 2017, while in 2016, not a single such case was reported due to pits
 sadak haadason kii is tasviir par sadak suraksha maamalon ke jaankaar rohit baluja kehete hai ki in durghatnaon ke liye jimmedaar afasaron par bhartiya dand samhita ke tahat hatya ke aapraadhik mukademe darj hone chahie
 Numerous reports have revealed that wrong design, poor maintenance and neglect of solving road problems are the biggest reasons for deaths in road accidents
 kendriya sadak mantralay ke ek afasar ne bataaya motor vaahan sanshodhan vidheyak main is tarah ke praavdhaanon ko shaamil kiya ja rahaa he
 The bill has been stuck in Parliament for a long time due to the failure of the Parliament to run smoothly
 modi sarkaar ko teen saal biit chuke hai
 The Congress has lost several consecutive elections since the 2014 general elections
 awam modi sarkaar se kaaphi had tak khush he
 The Opposition is unable to find any point of opposition even after wanting it, nor does it seem to be trying for it
 iske ulat modi jitne majboot hote ja rahe hai unka vipaksh utana hi kamjor hota ja rahaa he
 Just before the SP two torn UP Assembly elections, there was a riot in the Samajwadi Party that the party got torn up
 tamaam baithkon ke baad akhilesh or shivpal ke bich sulah to hui lekin bich-bich main donon ek duusare par kataaksh karne se nahin chookte
 After the humiliating defeat in the elections, Mulayam Singh Yadav has once again maintained silence
 party main do faad saaf najar aata he lekin taqatvar khemaa akhilesh yadav kaa hi he
 UP is the most important part of the country in terms of politics and Samajwadi Party has been saying that UP is the largest party
 paariwarik dangal main fansi samaajawaadee party kaaphi kamjor najar aa rahi he
 This is the reason why there is no pressure from the opposition on Yogi Adityanath and his government
 or iskaa saaf asar kendra kii modi sarkaar par bhi najar aa rahaa he
 After lalu-nitish, the states with the biggest political upheaval after Daruup are Bihar
 2014 main bijepi ke aae 'achche din' par haar kaa batta lagane vaala rajya yahi he
 However, for this defeat, the RJD and JDU, which were anti-incumbent, formed a historic alliance and the ambitious Lalu Prasad Yadav handed over the keys of power to Nitish Kumar
 lekin nitish kumaar ke notebandi kaa samarthan karne ke baad media main aae din 'bihar kaa gathbandhan tuutane ke kagaar par' kii khabaren aati raheen
 The Congress seems more battered that these days 'good days' of BJP and 'bad days' of Congress are going on in the country
 desh main sabase bura haal agar kisi raajnneetik party kaa he to vah desh kii kendriya satta par sabase zyada din kabiz rahane vaali congress kaa he
 In whose hands the future of the party will not be understood
 party kaa tamaam muddon par stand kya he janata ko pataa hi nahin
 The role of the opposing party is also absent in the House
 sonia gandhi lagaataar biimaar chal rahi hai or rahul gandhi kuch zyada active najar nahin aate
 They are active during the election phase, but the defeat gives them hope
 eidiemke do favedakshin main mahatvapurn rajya tamilnadu main bhootpurv mukhyamantri jayalalita kii mrityu ke baad upja raajnneetik sankat khatm hone kaa naam hi nahin le rahaa he
 Every day, he moves from new directions to the Chief Minister's residence
 sattarudh dal eidiemke do faad ho chukaa he
 Many attempts at reconciliation have proved unsuccessful
 party kaa ek dhada panniraselvam ke saath he to ek palanisvami ke saath
 Political pundits are describing this as a beneficial situation for the BJP
 mamata ko gherne kii kavayadshah-modi kii jodi in dinon raashtrapati chunaav ko dhyaan main rakhte hue or pashchim bengal main bijepi ke bhavishya ko dhyaan main rakhte hue lagaataar mamata banerjee kii gheraabandi kii koshish kar rahi he lekin safalataa hasil nahin ho paa rahi he
 Mamata Banerjee's growing popularity in front of Modi government can also be a big challenge as TMC not only returned to power in the 2016 assembly elections but won 27 seats more than the previous elections (total 184 seats in 2011) (211 seats in 2016 )
 vampanthi or zyada simatekeral ko chhod den to ab vamapanthiyon ke liye pichley teen saalon main koi khaas khushkhabari nahin ai

 All four of them abused the minor physically due to being a Dalit

 Even to discredit him, the accused made the video viral

 bihar sarkaar ne bina koi nayaa kar lagaae vittiya varsh 2017-18 ke liye 1
 60 lakh crore budget presented

 87 percent
 siddiki ne kaha ki centre sarkaar ne kai nitigat nirnay liye hai
 They have also had a significant impact on the state's economy and the entire system
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki centre sarkaar kii pratikul nitiyon yatha vishesh rajya kaa darja nahin die jane, fund shering kaa pattern badal dene, vishesh package nahin dene or notebandi ke jhanjhaavat ke baavjood rajya sarkaar kaa utsaah bana rahaa
 'we do not talk of the moon and the sun, we talk of diyas, it is a symbol of common man's combativeness
 ‚Äô Siddiqui said, 'if the help from the central government, such as the special package announced by the honorable Prime Minister, would have been received, the funding pattern of the national schemes changed by the center would have made some special arrangements for poor states like Bihar and special states to Bihar
 Had it been awarded, my budget could have taken four moons
 ‚Äô unhone kaha ki pichley ek saal ke dauraan desh, duniya arthvyavastha main kaaphi uthal-puthal hui he
 Its effect is visible everywhere and the common man is feeling
 notebandi ke kaaran bhi arthvyavastha main kuch dikkatein aayin hai
 'there will never be such a time in our life and in your life when there is a shortage of money in the market for 100 days
 hamaari 94 pratishat vyavastha rupee par chalati he
 We are yet to adopt plastic money and digital transactions
 aisi sthiti main rojgaar, aamadani, kharch or dainik jivan bahut prabhavit hua
 ' bajet pesh karne ke baad patrakaron se baatcheet main jab yah poocha gaya ki pradesh main pichley saal lagu sharabbandi kaa kya rajasav prapti par prabhaav padaa he? jawaab main siddiki ne kaha ki duusare sector se hamaari aamadani badi he
 He said that the separate classification of plan and non-plan implemented from 1951 was abolished from the financial year 2017-18, consequently, the state government also merged the budget accounting code by merging plan and non-plan items from this financial year
 And it has been decided to classify it into capital category
 siddiki ne kaha ki vittiya varsh 2017-18 se rajya sarkaar ke vyay vargeekaran sthapana evam patibaddh vyay, rajya skim, kendriya pryojit skim or kendriya kshetra skim ke rup main kiya jayega

 The Opposition is alleging that the Commission did not announce the date for the Gujarat Assembly elections along with the Himachal Pradesh Assembly elections due to bjp's 'pressure'
 congress ne bijepi par aarope lagaaya he ki vah chunaav ayog par besharmi ke saath dabaav kaa istemaal kar rahi he taaki vah antim samay main lok-lubhaavan vaade kar gujarat main votaron ko aakarshith kar sake
 Addressing a seminar on 'political Reforms in India' at the Nalsar University of Law, Varun said, "one of the biggest problems is the Election Commission problem, which is really a toothless tiger
" samvidhan kaa anuchhed 324 kahata he ki yah (chunaav ayog) chunaavon kaa niyantran evam paryvekshan karata he
 But does it really happen? ‚Äùhe said,‚Äú He does not have the right to file a lawsuit after the election is over
 aisa karne ke liye use ucchtam nyaayalay janaa padataa he
 The BJP MP from Sultanpur Lok Sabha seat of Uttar Pradesh said that the Commission never declared any political party invalid for not filing election expenses on time
 varun ne kaha, 'yun to sari partiyaan der se ritern daakhil karti hai, lekin samay par ritern daakhil nahin karne ko lekar sirf ek raajnneetik party (enpipi), jo divangat pi e sangama kii thi, ko amaanya ghoshit kiya gaya or ayog ne uski ore se kharch report daakhil karne ke baad usee din apane faisle ko waapas le liya
 He said that the budget allocated to the Commission for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was Rs 594 crore, compared to 81 in the country
 4 karod voter hai
 In contrast, this budget is double in Sweden, where the number of voters is only seven million
 varun ne chunavi vyavastha main dhanabal ke atyadhik prabhaav ko sweekaar karte hue kuch udhaaharan die
 He said that it has become almost impossible for poor and middle class people to contest elections in Parliament and Assembly
 raajnneetik partiyon kii ore se chunaav prachaar par badi dhanrashi kharch karne kaa zikr karte hue bijepi netaa ne kaha, 'takneekee taur par koi vidhayak (ummidavaar) 20 se 28 lakh rupye ke bich kharch kar saktaa he or saansad (pratyaashee) 54 se 70 lakh rupye kharch kar sakate hai
 But you are not told that political parties spend a lot of money on elections
 raajnneetik kharch kii yah vyavastha sunishchit kar detii he ki madhyam varg yaa garib tabake kaa koi vyakti chunaav nahin lard sake
 He exuded confidence that political parties will gradually move towards transparency

 Apart from JDU, Bihar BJP has also demanded strong action against MNS
 bihar bijepi adhyaksh nityanand raay ne kaha ki vah is masale par maharashtra ke siem se baat karenge
 This is completely hooliganism of Raj Thackeray and his supporters

 The political battle of western Uttar Pradesh, which started from kiln-parsaul, is constantly overshadowing the Bharatiya Janata Party veterans
 rahul gandhi kii sakriyata is ilaake main jis kadar badi he, usase kai diggaj netaaon kii maujuudagi ke baavjood bhaajapa ko is mudde par apana dam dikhaane main dikkat aa rahi he
 Former BJP president Rajnath Singh, senior state leader Kalraj Mishra and in-charge of the state Uma Bharti have visited the area since the firing in bhatta-parsaul in May
 lekin parrty ko rajnatik badhat milti najar nahin aa rahi
 Looking at the developments, in the politics of arrests, when Rahul's arrest was overshadowed by Rajnath's arrest, Mishra came forward through the 'kisan Bachao Yatra' to handle the slipping hand
 mishra ne 12 june ko ilaake ke peedit gaanvon ke kisaanon se mulaakaat kii or unhen har tarah kii kanoonee sahaayta muhaiyaa karaane kaa bharosa dilaayaa
 But this bet of the BJP also did not have much effect and barely four farmers considered Pararti worthy of narrating their agony
 shaayad kisaanon kii yaad se pichley saal kii vah baat miti nahin he jab tappal main arun jetali ne kanoonee sahaayta dene kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin baad main kisaanon ko kori sahaayta nahin mil saki
 By the time the party tried to connect with the farmers, Rahul Gandhi started the march from the kiln Parsaul on July 5 and again pushed the BJP back
 udhar greater noida ke shahberi gaanv main kisaanon kii 156 hectare jameen waapas karne ke supreme court ke faisle ne kisaanon ke saath ho rahe anyaay ko akatya tathy bana diya
 Does the BJP really consider land acquisition an issue or is this issue missing from the party's radar? On this question Rajnath Singh, special election in-charge of Uttar Pradesh, said, "BJP has been continuously raising the issue of farmers and is still taking it seriously
 lekin yah media kii maansikta he ki agar rahul gandhi khans bhi den to use dinabhar tivi par dikhaaya jaataa he, jabaki kisaan kaa betaa rajnath singh yaa (divangat) mahendra singh tikait jameen par utren to khabar nahin banati
 The intention of the Congress regarding the farmers is not clear and Rahul Gandhi is trying to throw dust in the eyes of the public
 jab 2007 se bhoomi adhigrahan bill taiyaar he to use paas kyon nahin karaate
 He rejected the argument that the current exercise of Rahul Gandhi would lead to bjp's land slipping in western Uttar Pradesh
 haalanki baar-baar yah poochne par ki kya bhaajapa pradesh main koi nayaa andolan shuru karegi, unhone koi sidhaa jawaab nahin diya
 Rajnath said, "if the BJP comes to power, policies of farmer interest will be brought
" '' agar pashchimi uttar pradesh se sansad main partiyon kii maujuudagi par najar daalen yahaan kii 16 loksabhaa siton main se bhaajapa 5, congress 3, basapa 5, sapa 1 or ralod kii do siten hai
 In this way, half of bjp's current parliamentary strength in the state is coming from western Uttar Pradesh itself
 iske baavjood party ko koi bada netaa apane dam par yahaan kaa chunavi jua dhone ko taiyaar nahin dikhataa
 In fact, so many leaders in the party have been put in charge of Uttar Pradesh that it has created confusion
 rajnath singh 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke vishesh prabharee hai
 The party president said in his letter that Rajnath Singh should pay special attention to Uttar Pradesh, but did not explicitly mention the post
 isse pehle uma bharti se bhi upi ke chunaav prachaar kii kaman sanbhaalane ko kaha ja chukaa he
 Mishra is the head of the election campaign committee
 iske alaava party mahasachiv narendra singh tomars bhi uttar pradesh ke prabharee hai
 However, Rajnath does not believe that any presence of more leaders is causing any confusion
 party pravaktaa prakaash jaavdekar ne bhi pradesh main nayaa andolan shuru karne ke sawaal ko taal diya or itnaa bhar kaha ki rajnath singh or uma bharti jaise bade netaa pehle hi pradesh main sakriy hai
 Mishra, who has promised legal aid to the farmers, said, "so far four farmers have come to the party
 ye raboopura gaanv ke kisaan hai
 They will be provided free legal aid through local lawyers
 kai kisaanon ne apane vakil pehle hi kar liye hai lekin ham vaada nibhaayenge
 "whatever may be the real reason for not trusting the farmers on the promises of the political parties, but the farmers know so much that every party may not be on their stomach, they definitely love the vote

 in vitt mantri arun jetali ne ek aisabajet pesh kiyajo ek najar main na to krantikari dikhataa he or na hi amul chul badlaav vaala, lekin aisa bajet jisamen janata ko khush karne ke moh se bachaa gaya he, pesh karne ke liye vitt mantri ko badhai
 The steps he has taken to promote business in the country, especially the manufacturing sector, and strengthen the infrastructure are in the right direction
 unhone is bajet ke jariye ek vijan taiyaar karne kii koshish kii he or li se hatakar ghoshnaaen karne kii bajaay sidhi baat kii he
 He spoke directly out of the Finance Ministers tradition of giving small facilities and giving small discounts or providing funds left for everyone
 bharat jaise ghor raajnneetik desh main is tarah kaa arthshaastri bajet pesh karnaa ek saahasik kadam he
 Through this budget, he has taken a big step towards creating a good environment for business in the country
 yah modi sarkaar ke mek in india ke vijan se mail khaataa he or us disha main kaam karata dikh rahaa he
 In this way they have tried to promote employment in the country
 korporate tex main paanch fisadi kii chhot dekar unhone unhen aashwast kiya lekin kaale dhane ke khilaaf nae kanoon kii ghoshnaa bhi kii
 The commitment shown by the Modi government to stop the spread of black money is reflected in this budget
 kaala dhan rakhane waalon ke liye kadi sajaa kaa praavdhaan rakhkar unhone sarkaar ke kathor iraade jataa diya
 Till now, there was neither will power nor any step to tackle black money in the country
 lekin is baar vitt mantri ne do took shabdon main apni sarkaar kii manshaa jataa di
 The efforts made by the previous government to stop the loot of subsidies were few
 is sarkaar ne jan-dhan yojana ke madhyam se is disha main bada kadam uthaaya he
 With this arrangement the subsidy will be available to the right person and this loot will stop
 lekin yahaan par vah sabsidi ghataane main thodaa took gaye
 If he wanted, he could have cut some subsidy
 vitt mantri ne is bajet main yah ghoshnaa karke ki jiesti yani guds and services tex agle saal april se lagu ho jayega, ek nai tex vyavastha kii shuruuaat ke sanket de die hai
 Regarding the revenue deficit, he has expressed an expectation that it can be controlled and this4
 1 pratishat par hi rahegaa
 This year, the government's tax collection fell short of the target, which was met from other sources
 agle saal ke bare main vitt mantri kaa swar aashaa se bharaa hua he
 They believe that it will be completed with fast growth rate
 is bajet kii agar koi aalochana ho sakati he to vah he ki yah krishi ke kshetra main utana dhyaan detaa nahin dikh rahaa he
 This year, due to better crops, prices of food items have fallen in the country, but what will happen next, it is difficult to say
 bajet main krishi kshetra ko utani variyata nahin di gai he or is disha main bade kadamon kii ghoshnaa bhi nahin he
 Perhaps the reason is that the contribution of agriculture has been falling in our total GDP
 lekin is bare main abhi thos kaam nahin ho paa rahaa he
 The Finance Minister has however made some announcements for the agriculture sector such as the Pradhan Mantri Gram Irrigation Scheme and the increase in agricultural credit
 lekin inase krishi ko vastav main badhaava mil sakegaa, is par sanshay bana rahegaa
 However, the Finance Minister can be congratulated for presenting this bold budget
