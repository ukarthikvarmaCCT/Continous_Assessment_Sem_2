 " desh main badhati rape kii vaardaat ko lekar mahila suraksha kaa sawaal ek baar phir surkhiyon main he
 During the discussion on the no-confidence motion in Parliament, the issue of women safety was raised by the opposition
 haal main haryana ke panchakula shahar main guest house main 22 varshiya ek mahila ke saath darindagi ke 40 logon par lage aarope ne desh main har kisi ko hilaa kar rakh diya
 Meanwhile, a message is also becoming viral on social media, claiming that the police has issued a helpline number for women traveling alone at night
 massej me yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki jab bhi mahila raat main akele kisi auto yaa taxi main baithe to 9969777888 par vaahan kaa number massej kar de
 According to the message claim, the police will then monitor the woman's journey on the vehicle till the completion of the help with GPRS
 massej main aisa kuch nahin bataaya gaya he ki ye vyavastha kis rajya kii police ne kii he
 a photo of a police officer has been posted with the bus message, which has been named Suresh Arora
 yah massej abhi tak pachaas hazaar se bhi zyada baar share ho chukaa he
 At the same time, people are pushing the back of the police for this arrangement through comments
 massej main ek baat aisi likhi hui he, jisase is par shaq paidaa hota he
 The message says that the taxi will be monitored with the help of GPRS technology
 jabaki kisi bhi lokation ko jaanane ke liye yaa najar rakhane ke liye GPS technology kaa istamaal hota he naa kii GPRS kaa
 When India Today Fact Check team messaged a taxi number on the given phone number to know the truth of the message, a message came from the other side too, which said - Thank you for information, call 100 number for emergency - Mumbai Police at your service
 ab ye pataa lagaana tha ki kya vaaki mumbai police nemahila suraksha ko majboot banane ke liye is helplinako shuru kiya ? mumbai police se jab is sambandh main sampark kiya gaya to jawaab mila- ‘8 march 2014 ko mumbai police ne MTNL ke saath milakar 'travel Safe When Alone’ naam se ek pahal kii thi
 With this, this helpline number was released
 lekin 2 march 2017 ko ise band kar diya gaya
 'mumbai Police had said that this number may still be operational from MTNL, so messaging on this number gives a response to contact Mumbai Police in response
 mumbai police ke jawaab se yah to saaf ho gaya ki mahilaon kii suraksha ke liye aisi vyavastha mumbai police kii ore se shuru kii gai thi jo ab band ho chuki he
 On searching the internet, it was also found that the police officer named Suresh Arora mentioned in the viral message is the DGP of Punjab Police
 twitor ke zarie punjab police se is massej kii sachai jaananaa chaahi to vahaan se saafe jawaab aayaa ki '' yah massej ekadam farzi he isko failaayaa na jaae
 The Punjab Police helpline number 181 is for women safety
 Please note that this is a fake news
 Please don't spread it
 — Punjab Police (@punjabpolice)july 24, 2018viral massej main jis helpline number kaa zikr kiya gaya, uskaa punjab police yaa vahaan ke dijipi suresh aroda se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 It is not that this message is being spread on social media for the first time
 pehle bhi is massej ko pradhanmantri narendra modi kii photo ke saath khub share kiya gaya tha 
 It is clear that spreading the message in this way does not produce any meaningful results, due to the inverted confusion, the police and citizens surely have to face the problem without any meaning

 a family-run party borne by the Congress in every election, this time in the Punjab elections, was asking to move past familyism and move forward
 lekin uske netaa is chhavi ko sudhaarney main khaas ruchi nahin le rahe hai
 That is why Congress leaders now want their family members to get tickets in the Punjab elections
 isi vajah sepunjabacongress kii ore se jab apane netaaon or kaaryakartaaon se aane vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main tikat kii ummidavaari ke liye aplicoshan maange gaye the
 So before that it was made clear that no leader or worker should file more than one application from his family
 vajah saaf he ki aane vaale punjab vidhansabha chunaav main party apane saath apane sir par parivaarwaad kaa aarope lekar nahin janaa chaahati
 To set an example, the Punjab Congress President had given this message to all the leaders and workers of his party long ago and the captain himself filed his own nomination from his family to get tickets from the party
 lekin ab apni hi party ko thenga dikhaate hue party ke das se zyada senior leaderon ne apane parivaar main se khud kaa, apane bete yaa beti kaa, yaa phir apni patni, beti yaa damaad kaa nomination party se tikat paane ke liye file kar diya or vipaksh ko ye kehane ko aarope thali main paros kar de diya ki congress party kabhi bhi parivaarwaad se baahar nikal hi nahin sakati
 These leaders have demanded tickets
 The senior leaders of the party who have demanded tickets for themselves and family members include Lal Singh, Rajendra Kaur Bhattal, Indrajit Singh Jeera, Rana Gurmeet Sodhi, Amrik Singh Dhillon, Pratap Bajwa
 
 vahiin jin party leaderon par apane parivaar kaa moh naa chhod paane ke aarope lag rahe he unka kahana he ki unhone party kaa koi niyam nahin todaa he or party unke parivaar main se kisi ko bhi chahen tikat den wo use manjuur kar lenge or unhen pataa he ki parivaar main se kisi ek vyakti ko hi tikat party degi
 Akali Dal has taken a break from the Congress, this nooriety has given the Opposition a chance to take a pinch and the Akali Dal said that the leaders of their party are afraid about the Congress that they will not come to power
 By doing so, they should save their seat and with any kind of jugaad, he or any member of his family becomes a bus legislator
 congress par hameshaa hi parivaarwaad badhaane ke aarope lagate rahe he or isi baat se baahar nikalne ke liye congress ne is baar punjab chunaav main ye aarope peeche chhodkar aage badhane kaa man banaaya tha lekin congress kii is pahal par usee kii party ke senior leaderon kaa apne or apane parivaar ke sadasyon ke liye tikat-moh baari pad rahaa he

 All parties are busy in their election preparations for the Lok Sabha elections and are setting their own political equations
 chunaav ko lekar dilli main bhi sthiti abhi saaf nahin he haalanki loksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar aam aadmi party or congress main raajnneetik rassakashi or tej hoti ja rahi he
 In this series, a large meeting of leaders was called in Delhi Congress office yesterday in which a list of about 68-70 names was sent to the Congress high command
 is baithak main congress netaaon ne ek swar main elaan kiya ki dilli main congress sabhi saaton loksabhaa seat par akele dam par chunaav ladegi or unhen kejariwal se kisi bhi tarah kaa gathbandhan manjuur nahin
 Delhi Congress Working President and former Minister Haroon Yusuf also clearly says that Congress workers are full of enthusiasm after Sheila Dixit's arrival and the Congress will win all the seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi as Kejriwal's false promises are fully recognized by the people of Delhi
 Has been done jis tarah se dilli main aam aadmi party congress ke saath gathbandhan ke liye aatur najar aa rahi he us par tanj kasate hue congress kaaryakari adhyaksh haaron yusuf kaa kahana he ki kejariwal kii yahi bechaini congress kaa aatmavishvaas he or yah jaahir karata he ki dilli kii sabhi saaton seat congress apane dam par jeetne ja rahi he or ab dilli main kejariwal kaa koi vajood nahin bachaa he
 So on the other hand, despite getting no proper reply from the Congress, the ruling Aam Aadmi Party alliance is seen telling the demand of the time, whether with Congress or without Congress and AAP party also seems to be touting the election on its own
 Has been aap netaa sanjay singh kaa kahana he ki aam aadmi party apane dam par saaton loksabhaa seat jitkar dikhaaegi
 Apparently, as the Lok Sabha elections are coming to a close, the news reports of the alliance between Kejriwal and the Congress are also becoming clear and these arguments are clearly visible in the statements of the party leaders
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki dilli main bijepi se mukaable ke liye bayanon kii bahaduree se muqabla hoga yaa gathbandhan kii ganth se muqabla
 Some experts may believe that India faced a weak West Indies side in the Test series of Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar, but former Indian fast bowler Manoj Prabhakar said that the Caribbean team was competitive
 manoj prabhakar ne kaha, ''west indies kii team jab sheersh par thi to virdohi timen unase darati thim
 
 
 They may have lost the Test series against India badly, but they are still a competitive team
 
 
 koi bhi yah nahin kah saktaa ki bharat ko kamjor virdohi mila
 
 
 '' antim antarrashtriya pari main sachin tendulkar ke 74 ran banane ke bare main poochne par manoj prabhakar ne kaha, ''sachin tendulkar ne ranjai match main khelkar test shrunkhlaa kii acchhee taiyaari kii thi
 
 
 The way he batted in the first innings was brilliant
 
 
 vah vidaai ko yaadgaar bananaa chahta tha or usne aisa kiya
 
 
 '' ullekhneey he ki jab varsh 1989 main sachin tendulkar ne antarrashtriya cricket main padaarpan kiya tha, manoj prabhakar bhartiya team kaa hissaa the or is purv tej gendbaaj ne kaha ki apane vivadrahit kariyar ke dauraan is mahaan ballebaaj main koi badlaav nahin aayaa
 According to Manoj Prabhakar, "sachin Tendulkar served the country without controversy during his 24-year-long career
 
 
 vah jab bhi desh ke liye khelaa, usne har baar apana kaam kiya
 
 
 He never let success dominate his mind and always kept his feet on the ground
 
 
 vah ant tak vahi vyakti rahaa, jo vah 1989 main tha
 
 
 '' 50-varshiya purv cricketer manoj prabhakar ne kaha, ''usne apane jivan ke dauraan bhi vahi anushaasan banaae rakhaa
 
 
 He gave the best days of his life to the country
 
 
 khel ke prati uski eemaandaaree ne use aisa mahaan cricketer banaaya
 
 
 '' udhar, ek anya purv cricketer maninder singh ne bhi kaha ki sachin tendulkar ne parfect spich ke saath khel ko alavida kaha
 "sachin was the best in his last innings," he said
 
 
 uski vidaai bemisaal thi
 
 
 His speech after the match made everyone emotional

 '' purvi dilli main kaam karne vaale safai karmchaaree ek baar phir se hadtaal par chale gaye hai
 The strike started with a demonstration outside the East Delhi Municipal Corporation headquarters on 18 May, but this time the strike is not showing the same effect as before
 darasal iske peeche kii sabase badi vajah he hadtaal ko lekar safai karmchaariyon kii union kaa ek raay naa hona
 Members of the MCD Sanitation Workers Union have been sitting on a dharna outside the East MCD headquarters for the past several days over their demands
 unka kahana he ki unki maangon ko har baar koi naa koi bahaanaa bana kar taal diya jaataa he
 This is the reason why they have to go on strike again and again
 is baar bhale hi ve hadtaal par hon lekin unkevirodh pradarshnamen dhar nahin dikh rahi
 Earlier, as soon as they went on strike, the cleaning workers used to spread garbage on the roads
 vahiin is baar waisi tasviren nahin dikhaai de raheen
 When asked, they say that they will not spread garbage on the roads this time due to the High Court order
 haalanki unhone kaha ki yadi kahin kooda he to wo use nahin uthaaenge
 At the same time, Rajendra Mewati of the second union of cleaning workers, Delhi Pradesh Safai Mazdoor Union, says that his union is not involved in the strike because the politics of strike is happening
 hadtaal ke jariye kuch union netaa apana rajanithik hit sadhate he or uske puraa hote hi hadtaal khatm kar dete hai
 After a few days, they start the strike again
 iske alaava ve kehete hai ki jab purvi dilli main shapath grahan hi 22 may ko hona he to usase pehle hadtaal par jane kaa koi auchity nahin dikhataa
 The impact of the two-tearing in the union of the workers who were missing the garbage pile is clearly seen on the strike
 hadtaal ke duusare din jab ajtak team ne mayur vihaar or vinod nagar kaa daura kiya to vahaan kooday ke dher nahin mili
 Even on those slopes, the garbage was very near where the garbage of the whole locality comes
 jaahir he hadtaal ko lekar unionon main virodhabhas he
 Due to this there is confusion among the cleaning employees but the benefit of this is directly to the people of Delhi

 Film: Kochanayan (3D) Actor: Rajinikanth, Deepika Padukone, r Sharath Kumar, Jackie Shroff, half director: Soundarya rajinikanthduration: 2 Hours, 4 Minutes: 3 in 5 There has been enmity between Kotapattinam and Kalinga State for centuries
 ek din kotapattinam kaa ek baccha bhaag jaataa he or gusse main jaakar dongi par savaar ho nadi main aage badhane lagata he
 Flowing in water, it reaches the state of Kalinga
 yahaan vah pehle sainik or phir senapati ke taur par apni dhak jamaa letaa he
 The name of this brave warrior is Kochanayana Rana

 But upon reaching here, everything turns around
 rana kaa asal makasad logon ke saamne aata he
 Why his heroic father and Mahasenapati Kochanayan was declared a traitor
 kyon iske baavjood vah kalinga se bandi sainikon ko mukt karakar lautaa
 Whether or not he got his love and what happened to his twin brother Dharma, he was separated in childhood

 film kii kahani pracheen kaal kii lagati he

 kochaneyan film main star apil he, jabardast set hai, ection he, romance he, dance he or drama bhi he
 New type of animation has been used in the film
 yah asal or ab tak ke anemation ke bich kii kadi lagata he
 It seems that the appearance and manner of the hero is true-machi, but his body and gait are aminated
 ye ek nae kism kaa tajurba sabit hoga
 The film stars Rajinikanth as Rana and Kochanayan in the name of Star Power
 unki premika vadanaa bani hai deepika padukon
 Dance and songs have also come, according to the trends of their cinema
 jaiki shroff ke role main donon tarah ke shades hai

 Everything seems to be Hollywood level
 kochaneyan bacchon ko bahut pasand aegi
 It has been seen so far that he has liked movies based on Chhota Bheem, Little Ganesh and Hanuman
 yah film uskaa aglaa step ho sakati he
 Among the elders who like war movies based on old plot, they can also go to see
 film dekhne ja rahe sabhi log dhyaan rakhen ki yah film multah tamil darshakon ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaai gai he

 Jayawardene and Dilshan shared a 63-run partnership for the first wicket, but for this they spent 62 balls
 isamen bhi jayavardhane kaa yogadan adhik tha jabaki dilashaan shuru se hi ran banane ke liye jujhate rahe
 Both of these batsmen opened the account with fours but after that they could not get the ball to see the boundary line continuously

 Ultimately these two proved to be the turning point

 Till now everybody used to think the same but now this perception has changed
 ab purush bhi pregnent ho sakate hai or bachche ko janm de sakate hai
 Only recently, a man has proved this by giving birth to a child

 Thomas has so far given birth to three children

 It is being told that the transgender male who has a female reproductive organ can easily give birth to a child
 iskaa matlab ye he ki ling parivartan ke baad purush bachche ko janm de sakate hai
 Thomas is now pushing other transgenders to become mothers of their children

 Friday is the last day of the NSG member countries meeting in Seoul
 aise main har kisi kii nigaah aakhri baithak par tiki hui he, lekin china samet 6 desh bharat kii mehnat par pani pher sakate hai
 On Thursday, these countries voiced fiercely in the meeting against the relaxation of rules to give membership to India

 Apart from China, Brazil, Austria, New Zealand and Turkey appeared in opposition to the proposal
 haalanki meeting shuukravaar ko bhi jari rahegi, lihaaja aas bani hui he
 On the other hand, China has once again stated that it cannot support India, Pakistan or any other country for membership without following the NSG rules
 china ne niyamon kaa hawala dete hue kaha he ki bharat ke liye uskaa virodh niyamon ke aadhaar par he
 Modi met with Xi, but did not talk
 Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday met President Xi Jinping from China in Tashkent
 piem ne jinping se kaha ki bharat ke paksh main banati aam sahmati ke saath china ko judana chahie
 But China has responded that if any exceptions were added to the membership of the NSG, it could deteriorate the balance of power in South Asia

 China has repeatedly said that India's membership is not on the agenda and it is understood that it has made every effort to stop any discussion on India's efforts

 a top Indian military official said here on Monday that Pakistan's internal situation will not allow that country to change its policy on Jammu and Kashmir issue
 vah aatankwaadiyon ko lagaataar bharat main bhej rahaa he
 Inaugurating a seminar on the topic 'mapping Pakistan', Kamanding Lt
 Gen
 NP Nehra, General Officer, 16th Corps of the Indian Army, said, "whatever the internal situation of Pakistan, it will not change its Kashmir policy
" " baad main samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main unhone kaha ki pakistan 'lagaataar ghuspaith kara rahaa he
 He is sending terrorists from across the border, but the army is on alert and unites day and night to thwart their efforts'
 ullekhneey he ki jeneral nehra ke adhinsth jawan bharat or pakistan ke bich bante kashmir kii sarajameen par bani niyantran rekha ke lagbhag 400 kilometre hisse kii chaukasee kar rahe hai
 Pakistan does not currently have a coup season, but this Islamic Republic is once again heading towards a deepening civil-military crisis
 america uski gardan par chadha baitha he, antarrashtriya mudra kosh (iemef) daravaaje par khadaa he, china uski rasoi tak main ghus chukaa he or iageies uske tahkhaane main chupa baitha he
 Despite this, the political and administrative mess in Pakistan is unprecedented
 uske akaash main sanvaidhanik, aarthik or suraksha sambandhi sankat ke badal chhaae hue hai
 The country's top leadership is implicated in the legal and political power struggle revolving around deputies Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his family
 udhar uskaa parmaanu shaktisampann dost china yahaan ke rajkaaj ke sankat kaa nateeja bhugat rahaa he, jisaki parinti kuch paryvekshakon ke mutabik inamen se kisi bhi rup main ho sakati haih taaja chunaav, nyaaypalika kii shah par siyasat kii safai, aarthik diwaliyapan, ek antarim sarkaar, aatankwaad kii ek nai lahar or yahaan tak ki bharat ke saath ek tanaavpurn sthiti shaayad america ke saath bhi
 It is certain that there will be no coup here
 aisa isliye kyonki ab nyaayadhish hi yahaan ke nae general hai or general kootnithik ban chuke hai
 As far as democratically elected leaders are concerned, they are all in a battle with everyone and even with themselves
 in tamaam halaat main agar kuch sabase zyada daanv par laga hua he to wo he desh par sabase lambey vakt tak raaj karne vaale khandaan kii siyaasi kismat
 Along with this, the political fortune of the country is also stapled
 pehla parivaar, parivaar pehlejulai main aghoshit aay ke chalate supreme court dwaara padchyut kar die jane ke baad logon ne sochaa tha ki navaj sharif ab aasaani se nikal lenge, unka avsaan ho chukaa he or ve chupchaap landan jaakar aaraam farmaayenge
 It was assumed that he would now make his way into politics for his able brother Shahbaz, the hardworking Chief Minister of Punjab who has been ruled by the Sharif dynasty since the early eighties when Zia was born from military power
 
 sankatarahit upachunaav ke baad maan liya gaya tha ki shahbaaj ab party kii kaman sanbhaalenge or aglaa aam chunaav samay ke mutabik agali garmiyon tak ho jayega
 Then it was assumed that the best party would win and that more and more of a coalition would replace Sharif's Pakistan Muslim league-nawaz (PML-N) and remain naturally entangled in Nawaz's absence
 baaki, navaj or unke parivaar kii kismat thik rahi to ve aatm-nirvaasan main jaakar dubak jaaenge yaa phir javabdehi se jude 18 se zyada mukademon kaa dansh jhelane ko majaboor honge
 None of this happened
 ab ise jabardast dhairya kaa parichaayak kahen yaa phir napa-tula adigalapan or bikharaa hua takaraav, lekin aisa teesri baar he ki na sirf purv pradhanmantri balki unka samoochaa parivaar hi peeche hatane ko taiyaar nahin dikh rahaa
 In August, Nawaz held a state-sponsored Homecoming rally when he drove a convoy of hundreds from Islamabad and passed through the GT Road in Punjab, creating an atmosphere that transformed the convoy into thousands
 ve kaaphi shaano-shaukat se lahore pahunche
 During the journey of several days, he had gathered enough supporters
 phir unhone khulkar chunauti de daali ki ''un logon ne" unke saath kya kiya he
 In this way, he tried to give a new slogan to his party which was in the form of the question "why was i removed?" It was obviously a new anti-incumbency - "why get me fired?" The military was not expecting a counterattack
 nyaaypalika bhi chup baithi rahi
 The opposition kept slamming during that time
 panamaliks kii sunwaayee main maheenon apni mehnat se fatah hasil kar ke nikle imran khan nathiyagali kii paharipoon main aaraam farma rahe the
 The anti-nawaz faction never thought of cutting them off
 vah maanata rahaa ki yah sab kavayad ek shaapit shaks kaa aakhri naatak he
 Those monsoon days were the days of Sharif's political retreat, but no one was aware of it and no one challenged him
 yahi beparwahee ab baari pad rahi he
 The atmosphere was in Nawaz's favor when September came
 unhone jang kii puraani yojana ko kachare main phenk diya tha
 Shahbaz was sidelined — some said he was close to the army
 dusron kaa kahana tha ki unki jarurat punjab ko chalaane ke liye ahm he kyonki pakistan main asal vot bank yaheen kaa myne rakhata he
 Nawaz symbolically and politically stood his wife Kulsoom in the by-election in Lahore
 adaalat ne unki yahi seat unase chin lee thi
 a tremendous move was going on at the Center level with the promise of a sustainable government
 shahid khakan abbasi ko antarim pradhanmantri ke pad par baitha diya gaya, jo navaj ke bade vafaadaar the, usiele se snaatak hai, america or fouj donon ke lihaaj se upyukt lekin navaj ko chunauti dene ke liye unamem loha kam tha
 They come from the cool plains under the Muri hills
 is tarah nae or puraane wajire ajam ke bich koi fark nahin tha
 Despite being tall in stature, the younger Abbasi openly stated that he is still reporting to Nawaz
 navaj kii patni landan main cancer kii chemotherapy karvaa rahi thim or idhar lahore ke upachunaav main ve apekshit margin se kam voton se jeet bhi chuki thim
 However, the PML-N was waiting for the new face to come on the stage — Maryam, Nawaz's biggest daughter and the pivot of the party's media hype, who has emerged as the true heir of her father today
 mariyam ne upachunaav main khud ko sabit kar diya
 His critics, however, say that Imran Khan's Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf was barely lagging behind the PML-N
 unke aane se haalanki paardarshita or ''gaayab" kaaryakartaaon ke bare main chintaaen ubhar kar saamne aa gayi or sabase badi baat yah hui ki fouj kii shah vaali milli muslim lig (hafiz said kii jamaat-ud-daawa kaa nayaa siyaasi cheharaa) or labbaak yaa rasul allaah party (ek kattar or kufr kanoon samarthak lahore ke dharmik andolan kii paidaaish) ne mariyam ke prachaar abhiyaan ke sahare 15,000 vot jhatak liye
 Suddenly, the success of these two new right-wing parties centered in Lahore created panic in the liberal and some less liberal political circles
 sawaal uthne lage ki kya iageies ke rajnatik dhade ne koi chaal chal di he yaa lahore main apane puraane samarthan aadhaar kaa laabh uthaakar mullah achaanak sakriy ho gaye hai?yah bahes khadi ho paati, usase pehle hi mariyam ne ise nibata diya
 The PML-N may have won the election, but Maryam and her propaganda machinery lashed out at the power establishment for infusing jihadis into the mainstream of politics
 unka majboot paksh saaf dikh rahaa tha ki chunaav jeetne ke baavjood unke chehre par vaisaa utsaah nahin tha
 Soon everything was clear by mid-september: Despite the GT Road rally and victory in the Lahore by-election, the family was still not ready to kneel
 use rajnatik vaapasi kerani thi or iske liye vah sab kuch karne ko taiyaar tha
 Princess Mariamalog says that she lacks the confidence of Benazir Bhutto
 ve aarope lagaate hai ki ve zyada se zyada fatima jinna kii tarah parchaai banakar rah jaaengi
 They question her democratic outlook as she considers Queen Rania of Jordan as the norm
 yahaan tak ki ve unke kaam par bhi sawaal uthaate hai
 Despite this, there is no doubt that Maryam is the new version of Nawaz Sharif
 unke bheetar apane pita kii satta-virdohi viraasat he or saamne vaale se sampurna samarpan va vafadari kii maang kii chaah bhi he
 Despite her removal, she is his Chief of Staff and holds the command of loyal ministers and bureaucrats
 ve unke mutabik hi kaam karte hai
 She is a bit aggressive in her body language, gives great sound bytes to TV and keeps the Twitter on fire
 bheed main ve shaleen kapade pahenti hai lekin drawing room or watsape par ve charchaaon kaa bis bhi hai
 Their media machinery turns on the pinch
 fouj ke baad media par sabase zyada unheen kii chalati he
 More importantly, Maryam aspires to return to Islamabad's power equation from where her father, husband and brothers have been hastened
 philhal, ve iske liye khulkar fouj kaa dosha de rahi hai lekin unke paas ab tak iskaa koi thos sakshya nahin he
 Even now, she does not desist from the habit of exaggerating the things that go on every day, while her loyal ministers are seen saying in Parliament and talk show circles that there is no conspiracy with the Sharif family to balance their agility
 is bich mariyam ne khud ko bina kisi pad ke vipaksh kii tarah kaam kar rahi satta kaa cheharaa banane main kamyaabi hasil kar lee he
 As one commentator said recently, Maryam has also divided the Sharif family into two pieces
 ab ve ek ore ke parivaar kii numaaindgi karti hai
 Meanwhile, when the government is facing allegations of not running the government properly, Shahbaz has not been able to get a central position even though officially he is still with his brother and despite the chaos within Nawaz or They do not have the political power to take away this right from Mary
 mariyam ne jo kuch soch rakhaa he vah keval apane pita ke liye or zyada-se-zyada khud ke liye—beshak, pita kii sahmati se hi
 Return, concession or conviction? The killing of a brother in the Punjab of Pakistan is called Sharika
 isaki utpatti duusare ke haq main shariq hone se judi hui he
 The enemies may have often called the two brothers Mughal because of their grandeur, but Nawaz and Shahbaz are not like each other like Aurangzeb and Dara Shikoh
 bade sharif ab bhi bos hai—yah baat pichley hafte ek intervyuu main unke bhai ne mujhase kahi thi
 For those who want things to go on, this can be a serious problem
 aktubar ke aarambh main navaj ne apratyaashit tareeke se apni sanvaidhanik vaapasi kii—sansad se ek vivaadaaspad sanshodhan paarit karvaa ke piemail-en kaa aadhikarik rup se niyantran apane haath main le liya jisase unke haath apni siyaasi vaidhata kaa daawa karne kaa ek ahm aujaar lag gaya jise adaalaton ne khaarij kar daalaa tha- lekin shere-punjab ke upar ab bhi bhrashtachar ke darjan bhar se zyada maamle lambit hai
 As faults against him and his family are getting thicker, they are not ready to kneel
 philhal ve itani jaldi pakistan nahin aane vaale hai
 He is yet to be convicted in more cases
 somvaar ko unhone apane puraane dost saudi ke shahi parivaar kii ek aghoshit yatra kii thi jiske baad ve landan laut aae (fouj ke pramukh general qamar javed bajva ne bhi pichley hakrate saudi kii aghoshit yatra kii thi jiske bare main fouj mukhyalay kii ore se koi vivaran jari nahin kiya gaya)
 Sharif's conviction now seems more fixed than ever and his legal fortunes are on the verge of sinking, yet his control over the government is not weakening
 bhale iske liye baari keemat chukaani pad jaae
 It is necessary to say one more thing in this context
 pakistan ke vitt mantri sharif kii patni ke bhai ishak daar hai
 Dar was convicted in September on corruption charges and the court seized his property last weekend
 yah sab us dauraan hua jab vishwa bank pakistan kii aarthik sthirataa par andeh jataane vaali ek report jari kar rahaa tha, iemef bhi chetavanee jari kar rahaa tha or share bazaar rasaatal main ja rahaa tha
 This warning was so vocal that the army chief General Bajwa also had to raise the issue of staggering economy
 pichley kai hakraton se in tamaam kaarnon ke chalate vipaksh daar kaa istipha maangane ko majaboor hua he lekin aisa ab tak nahin hua, jabaki vittamantri par lagaataar desh ke vittiya kuprabandhan ke aarope lag rahe hai
 Within a few months of their hearing, their weight has dropped by more than 20 kg, which seems clear, yet they are adamant on their stand
 vyavastha ke khilaaf sharif ke adigalapan ke ek pratik ke rup main daar kii jid ko dekha ja saktaa he
 Both of them remain in power in some way and are still behaving like rebels
 ek vittiya kansaltency chalaane vaale sarkaar ke purv salaahkaar saaqib sheraani kehete hai, ''aisa lagata he ki sarkaar ekasutreey agenda par kaam kar rahi haih samvidhan kii avmaananaa kar ke sharif parivaar ko kanoon se bachaana
 The remaining challenges facing the country — a failing economy, growing regional and geopolitical pressure — are not being taken care of
 "idhar shahbaaj ke upar khud hatya or hawala ke aarope hai
 These matters are still buried
 log kah rahe hai ki unhen jaan-boojhkar mauka diya ja rahaa he ki ve pehle apana ghar durust kar len, bhai se kaman apane haath main len, satta pratishthan se hone vaale sambhavit takaraav ko roke or chizon ko patari par le aaen
 Finally, a senior PML-N minister said on condition of anonymity, "we have three goals
 ek, ham nahin chaahate ki party tut jaae yaa phir iesai jaison dwaara tod di jaae
 Secondly, we want to protect ourselves till the Senate elections in March
 tisare, ham nahin chaahate ki miyaan sahab ko sajaa ho
 "the March 2018 Senate election is constitutionally very decisive in all three of these goals
 agar piemail-en sarkaar isamen kaamyaab rahi, to nauven dashak ke baad pehali baar ucch or nichle donon sadanon main uskaa niyantran ho jayega
 After this happens, some amendments can be passed before the end of the term of the House to cut the rights of the military and the judiciary, before the next general election is announced
 piemail-en ke halkon main aise kuch gambhir upayon par pehle se hi charchaa chal rahi he
 In this way, one can say that March is the last date for the culmination of what is going on at the moment
 march ke chunaav keval kuch sau seenetteron kii kismat tay karne tak simit nahin hai
 So far, however, it is not clear what the PML-N will do till March, how it will do and how it will be allowed to do its will
 kya navaj pakistan lautnaa chunenge, puri prakriya se guzrenge or jail jane kaa jokhim uthaaenge (yaad rahe ki ve jald hi 70 baras ke hone vaale hai)? kya mariyam vahiin rahengi or yahi jokhim uthaane ko taiyaar hongi? kya shahbaaj apane bade bhai ke saaye se mukt hokar koi ''sauda pata lenge" taaki unhen bhi vahi kanoonee keemat na chukaani pade?kya kanoonee maamalon main kamjor lekin saaf dimag imran khan kii aguai vaala vipaksh aise kisi saude ke paksh main hoga yaa phir virodh main sadak par utrega? kya piemail-en shahid khakan abbasi ke netritv main punargathit hoga jo khud ko ek sthanapann pradhanmantri se kuch or badi shakhsiyat main tabdeel kar lenge—unka videsh vibhaag aalaa staron par santulan banaae hue he or isi hakrate america videsh mantri rex tilorsan ke saath hui baithak main usne naagarik-sainya ekajutata dikhaate hue kashmiri netaaon se vaarta ke liye bharat sarkaar ke vaartakar niyukt karne ko khaarij kiya he
 This step was taken only an hour after the announcement and it all happened within a day
 duusare, agar satta main rahakar virodh karne kaa navaj kaa yah model nahin tikaa or / yaa afgaan-america-bharat kii niti main daraar padi, to kya abbasi technocrate peshewaron kii ek sarkaar ke liye sahajata se rasta banaate hue ghutane tech denge? yaa phir rajnatik athwa alahada halake se koi chupa rustam ubhar kar saamne aayega?yaad rahe, aaj jaj hi nae general hai
 Musharraf Zaidi, a former advisor to the Ministry of External Affairs, says, "judicial intervention is being seen in executive work at many levels
 ise logon kaa vishwaas hasil he, aanshik rup se isliye kyonki rajnatik bhrashtachar or karypalika kii aakshamata ke mudde main bahut takat he
 In the absence of executive performance, judges will get more legitimacy due to their interventions
 " is tarah pakistan kii kahani chalati rahegi, bhale hi maujuuda satta apana safar puraa na kar sake
 Everything depends on the hammer of justice of the Honorable courts

 (PTI) kerala kaa sanghathan popular front of india (PFI) aatankwaad se kathith taur par taar jude hone kii vajah se rashtriya jaanch agency (NIA) ke radar par he
 India Today's Special Investigation Team exposed PFI in its investigation last year
 isamen PFI ke hawala or dharm parivartan jaisi gatividhiyon se kathith judaav kaa bhi khulaasa hua tha
 But is this non-profit Islamic organization gathering swords to attack Hindus in future? In a similar post viral on social media, PFI is being accused
 india today kii viral test team ne soshal media par PFI ke khilaaf chetavanee dene vaali post kii padtaal kaa faisla kiya
 On the Facebook page uploaded on the page named as 'bhagwa Deewane', the post reads - "sleeping keep Hindus, Muslim community is preparing for heavy bloodshed against you"
 kerala main PFI ke jihadiyon kii asalaah kii factory par chapa maar baari maatra main hathiyaaron kaa jakhira pakadaa gaya, jahaan se puure bharat kii masjid, madrason or muslim bahul ilaakon main hathiyaar bheje ja rahe hai
 "swords and other sharp weapons can be seen scattered on the ground in the photograph with the message in the post
 saath hi khaanchon par bhi inhen rakhaa hua dekhe ja saktaa he
 We first turned to the Kerala Police as part of the investigation
 hai tech krime inkavairi cell ke adhikari anup viaar ne post ko puri tarah farji bataate hue khaarij kiya
 Anoop told India Today's viral test team that 'no raids were conducted against the PFI where the swords were recovered
 ’viral test team ne PFI se bhi sampark kiya
 The organization's general secretary Mohammad Bashir said that such alleged information is an attempt to tarnish the image of the Muslim organization
 bashir ne kaha, ‘ye puri tarah farzi he
 Earlier, it appeared as a Malayalam Facebook post
 ye hamaare sanghathan kii chhavi kharaab karne kii ek or koshish he
 According to Bashir, the PFI has informed the cyber cell of the entire case
 bashir ne malayalam post ke screenshots ko bhi saajha kiya jisamen PFI ke upar hinduon par hamale kii taiyaari kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he
 The post reads - 'SDPI arms have been seized
 police do kamaron main talavaarein bhari dekhakar hairaan rah gai
 They also seized raw materials used in making swords
 hinduon, hoshiyaar
 Police say more weapons will be seized
 ’ SDPI yani soshal democratic party of india PFI kaa raajnneetik wing he
 Viral tests have proved that the post targeting PFI is fake
 ab hamane ye pataa lagane kii koshish kii PFI ko farji tareeke se jodne vaali tasviir kaa mul strot kya he
 Viral tests revealed that the photograph was taken from Khalsa kirpan, a factory for making kirpan (a religious symbol of Sikhs) of Sikhs in Patiala, Punjab
 factory ke maalik bachan singh ne pushti kii ki tasviir main unheen ke godaam ko dikhaaya gaya he
 Bachhan Singh also showed our correspondent the place where this photograph was taken
 ye puche jane par ki kisne ye tasviir lee hogi to bachan singh ne kaha ki unki factory main kuch saal pehle paryatakon kaa ek group aayaa tha
 Shingara Singh, brother of Bachchan Singh, told India Today, 'this store has been around for the last 20 years
 ham puure punjab main saamaan kii aapurti karte hai
 Swords are called kirpan in Sikhism
 hamaare dharm main samaaroh main kisi ko sammanit karne ke liye iskaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Because of its inclusion in the five symbols of Sikhism, Amritdhari Sikhs always carry the little saber
 ’singh ne bataaya ki hamaare dharmik netaaon ko sammanit karne ke liye unhen kripaan saunpi jaati he
 Also, they are exchanged in fairs
 log inhen apane gharon main rakhte hai or paryatak smritichihn ke taur par inhen saath le jate hai
 Viral tests proved that the posts linking PFI to Talwar Factory are fake
 lekin iskaa ye matlab nahin ki popular front of india ko clin chit mil gai he
 High officials of this organization were caught on the camera of India Today confessing to be involved in mass conversion activities and hawala transactions

 mumbai blast ke peeche indian mujahidin or lashkar donon kaa haath he
 The joint operation was carried out by the two terrorist organizations in September 2010
 grahamantralay ke sutron ke mutabik yah sajeesh sitambar 2010 main rachi gai thi
 See how Mohsin Chaudhary, a member of the Mumbai Indian Mujahideen and his brother Akbar were killed in Karachi in the second week of September last year
 vahaan in donon kii mulaakaat lashkar ke kaagazi or ansaari se hui
 After this, both of them also met Ilyas Kashmiri and Bhatkal brothers several times
 in donon ne isi dauraan karachi ke baahar daaud ibrahim se bhi mulaakaat kii
 See what Home Minister p Chidambaram said on the Mumbai blasts, serial blasts were hatched in Mumbai and Ahmedabad during these meetings
 saath hi in dauraan donon sanghathanon ke gujarat or maharashtra main milakar kaam karne par bhi rajamandi hui
 30 people were recruited from the Gulf and Sri Lanka to materialize the blasts in Dadar, Jhaveri and Opera House
 in logon ko lashkar ne karachi main ek maheene kii training di gai or phir srilanka ke raste bharat bheja gaya
 This time, the border of Pakistan, Nepal or Bangladesh was not used in the conspiracy
 mumbai blast main maare gaye logon ko di gai shradhanjalibharat pahunche kar ye log 2-3 kii tukdi main bant gaye or desh main vibhinn sthanon par sthit indian mujahidin or daaud ke sleeper cell ke logon se mulaakaat kii
 These people also did Reiki and videography of their targets
 lashkar dwaara paisa muhaiyaa karaaye gaye in logon ne antat mumbai main serial blast ko anjaam diya
 Indian Mujahideen and Lashkar join hands: Indian Mujahideen have joined hands with Taliban to attack India
 isi saal june main vadodara railway stesan par pakade gaye iem ke aatankwaadi danish riyaj se poochtacha main aise hi sanket mili hai

 He stands before five years of development: a 155 mm Bofors-like cannon fitted on an eight-wheeled Tata truck
 mounted gan system (mgs) kahalaane vaali yah top teen minute se kam samay main hi 40 kimi
 Can fire up to six rounds of fire at a target located at a distance of
 yah bharat kii pehali swadeshi taur par dizin kii gai top he
 "we did not ask the government to fund this project," says Chaudhary
 hamane isamen apane shairdharakon kaa dhan lagaaya he
 The Kargil battle in 1999 showed why the Indian Army needed such fire power
 is yuddh main sweden main bani boforce topon ne pakistani sena dwaara kabja kii gai chotiyon par golabari kii thi
 In the year 1999, the army raised 27,000 crores
 se zyada laagat kii 2,200 boforce jaisi artilari (top) gan aayaat karne ko hari jhandi dikhaai
 The reason was that no Indian firm makes such guns
 sena kii top kharid ke aakaar (duniya main sabase bade) ko dekhte hue bhartiya udyog bhi top nirmaan main nivesh ke liye prerit hua he
 About $ 100 billion (rs
 5,00,000 crore)
 ) kaa tata samooh top ke kaarobaar main kadam rakhane vaala iklauta nahin he
 On 6 December this year, the state-run Ordinance Factory Board (OFB) opened fire with the first cannons made at its Jabalpur factory
 ye gan sena ko milane vaali aisi 200 topon kii pehali khep main se hai
 Private sector firm Bharat Forge has set a deadline of 2015 to produce a Todd version (towers) of 155mm cannons
 company ke pune sthit kaarkaane main iskaa nirmaan kiya ja rahaa he
 The Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) hopes to have 155 mm guns designed by 2014
 boforce topein kharidne ke baad sena pichley 25 saal main koi nai top nahin kharid pai
 After the launch of the Bofors scandal in 1987, the new purchase came to a standstill due to frequent cases of corruption in cannon procurement deals
 raksha karmiyon ko ghoose dene ke aarope main raksha mantralay ne chaar antarrashtriya top companiyon solatam, denael, singapore technologies kynetics or reinametal ko blaclist main daal diya
 Bofors is now owned by uk-based company BAE Systems
 pehle yah sweden kii company thi
 Bofors is out of competition in the Indian market this time as it is not confident of offering the cheapest option
 pichley paanch varsh main sena ne lagaataar apane topakhane kii ghatati sankhya ko lekar chetavanee di he
 Finally, last year, the Defense Acquisition Council decided to look for options within the country to acquire weapons faster
 usne oefbi se topon ke nirmaan kaa kaam shuru karne ko kaha
 Defense Minister A
 ke
 Antony inaugurated a gun manufacturing factory on September 22 at the ofb's century-old Gun Carriage Factory in Jabalpur
 sena ne ab is kshetra main kai swadeshi khiladinnon ke utarane kaa swaagat kiya he
 However, it will still take at least five years to acquire an India-made cannon
 nijee kshetra ne videshon se takanic kharid kar vikaas main lagane vaale samay ko ghataane kii koshish kii he
 For example, Bharat Forge has bought gun technology from its cannon manufacturers in Austria and Switzerland for its indigenous cannon
 tata power ne samrik kshetra ke apane do projects se mili anubhavon kaa istemaal kiya he
 In 2006, he got about 172 crores of 20 Pinaka Multi Barrel Rocket Launcher for Army
 kaa order hasil hua tha
 The second project consisted of 105 mm cannons to be placed on the truck
 usne gan or firing pranali videsh se aayaat kii he, lekin sateek golabari ke liye fire control system or belisticks jaisi takanic main khud maharath hasil kii he
 The Defense Ministry's Rajasthan-based cannon test range is awaiting government approval for the firing test of its cannons
 yadi ye topein safal rahati hai to unhen sena ke liye 814 aisi topon ke kareeb 8,500 karod ru
 You can get a chance to bid in the tender
 company ne apni mounted gan (topon) ke swadeshi str par utpaadan ke liye sarkaar ke saamne vistrut khaakaa pesh kiya he
 This could be a way out of Bofors' wretchedness

 com / 1yv108mz63— ANI UP (@aninewsup)january 13, 2019 After Delhi and Maharashtra, there is also a demand to reduce electricity rates in UP
 ye maang or koi nahin balki sattarudh samaajawaadee party ke netaa hi kar rahe hai
 Samajwadi Party general secretary and party candidate from Lucknow Lok Sabha seat Ashok Vajpayee has written a letter to Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav demanding reduction in electricity rates in UP
 vaajapeyi kaa kahana he ki upi main aise garib log jo ham maheene dhai sau unit se kam bijli istemaal karte hai, unki daron main 25 pratishat kii kami kar di jaae
 However, Akhilesh Yadav has already said that the State Electricity Regulatory Commission is responsible for reducing the electricity rates
 vaajapeyi kii maang ko dilli main sasti bijli dene kii aam aadmi party sarkaar kii ghoshnaa se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 Vajpayee probably feels that if the electricity rates are reduced, his fleet may cross the Lucknow seat
 haalanki, vaajapeyi ne is baat se unhone inkaar kiya ki ye 'kejariwal effect' hai
 How reasonable is Vajpayee's demand? In Uttar Pradesh, the state government gets a revenue of Rs 1,800 crore from rural domestic consumers of electricity, while urban domestic consumers get about Rs 6200 crore
 sarkaar agar gramin upabhoktaaon ke liye 25 pratishat kii sabsidi detii he to sarkari khajaane par saadhe chaar sau karod rupee kaa boj padegaa
 Experts say that in addition to this, the electricity rates can be reduced even if the government completes its deficit and recover the arrears
 uttar pradesh rajya vidyut upabhokta parishad ke adhyaksh avadhesh mishra kaa kahana he ki upabhoktaaon par 29 hajaar 325 karod rupee kaa bijli kaa bakaayaa he or bijli vibhaag kaa ghaataa 26 hajaar karod rupee kaa he
 If the arrears are recovered then the electricity department will come to the benefit of Rs 3300 crore
 isse bijli kii daren 25 fisadi kam karne main koi dikkat nahin hogi
 Line losses are also 26 percent in UP
 agar 15 pratishat maanak maanakar 11 pratishat line los main kami kar lee jaae to vibhaag ko 4000 karod rupee kaa phayda ho saktaa he
 On the same basis, electricity rates can be reduced
 haalanki, bijli kii daren kam karne kaa prastaav upi vidyut niamak ayog ke saamne lambit he
 The Chief Minister has also said that reducing or increasing the rates are in the hands of the Electricity Regulatory Commission

 com ke liye likhe ek blog main yashavanth sinha ne kaha ki bhale hi ghotaalaa systmatic felyor kaa nateeja hota he or koi bhi vittamantri har samay, apane neeche kaam karne vaali har sanstha ke har krity par nazar nahin rakh saktaa, lekin vah apni sanvaidhanik or loktantric zimmedaari se bhi nahin batch saktaa
 After this, he has asked 10 questions, which according to him are mandatory to get to the root of the case
 yadi neerav modi kaa ghotaalaa 2011 main shuru hua tha, to bataaya jaae ki har saal kitne letters of anderstanding (lou yaa aloyu) jari kiye gaye? maamle ko isse aage saaf-saaf samajhane ke liye may, 2014 ko ek khaas vakt maan liya jaae, or bataaya jaae ki may, 2014 tak kitne aloyu jari hue, or kitne us saal ke ant tak
 The amount of each LOU should be indicated
 bataaya jaae ki aloyu kitni avadhi ke liye vaid tha - 90 din, 180 din, 365 din yaa usase bhi zyaada
 It should be told that how much amount was withdrawn from foreign banks on each LOU? In how many cases the LOU amount was returned to PNB? How many LOU guarantees were not returned to PNB? If any foreign bank branch did not get the money in time, did it report to PNB? In how many cases, pnb's guarantee was used to recover the outstanding? Because it involved foreign exchange transactions, then how can we tell that this transaction was left in the eyes of RBI? It is being told that Nirav Modi had created 200 shell companies through which transactions took place, but then what happened to the government's claim that all such fake companies have closed down after demonetisation? If they can calculate Nirav Modi's confiscated assets immediately, then why are they not sharing simple information? And finally, Who is benefiting from this confusion? We should not forget that this news has relevance until the media gets some big news? After that, Nirav Modi will also become history like Mallya
 daliton ke mudde par raajnneetik partiyaan kitni gambhir hai, iskaa najaara guuruuvaar ko loksabhaa main dekhne ko mila
 At least 55 mps are required to run the proceedings of the House, but even this modest number of mps were not present in the Lok Sabha
 sabase badi baat yah ki dalit mudde par bahes kii maang karne vaala vipaksh bhi nadaarad tha
 In the midst of the ongoing debate on the issue of Dalit oppression, what did Home Minister Rajnath Singhthodi get up for late, the opposition started making noise
 rajeev pratap rudi ne turant use aainaa dikhaaya
 Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Rajiv Pratap Rudy told the opposition that your first full line is empty
 dalit mudde par bahes dopaher 2 bajkar 35 minute par shuru honi thi, lekin saasando kii kami kii vajah se sadan kii kaarywahi 3 minute kii deree se shuru hui
 The bell kept ringing for three minutes, then the bell of the MP MP quorum did not ring for 3 minutes
 aakhirkaar 2:38 baje korum puraa hua or charchaa shuru ho pai
 However, even then only 75 mps were present at the beginning of the debate
 grahamantri rajnath singh samet satta paksh kii taraf se sirf 38 saansad upasthit the, vahiin vipaksh kii bench bhi khaali thi
 Even when the debate started, only eight Congress mps were in the House
 jabaki kai saansad sansad bhawan main maujuud the, lekin loksabhaa main anupasthit
 In the absence of Congress leaders, Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia tried to avoid this by shielding him
 party ke vip chif sindhiya ne kaha ki sansad main hamaare 18 saansad the
 Sonia Gandhi is in the hospital and Rahul Gandhi is with her
 loksabhaa main pramukh vipakshi dal ke netaa mallikarjun khadge ko achaanak bengaluru janaa padaa
 In the absence of its leaders, the Congress attack also looked weak
 aakhri vakt main sindhiya ne morcha kholaa
 Questioning the absence of the Prime Minister, 'scindia tried to create a Dalit-free India', Scindia said, 'why don't pms answer in the House
 ' trinmul ne bhisarkaar ko gherneki koshish kii
 Scindia attacked, saying that BJP talks about Congress-mukt Bharat, now an attempt is being made for a Dalit-free India
 frinz element centre ho gaye hai
 There is no BSP MP in the Lok Sabha, trying to pressure Mayawati from outside, so before the debate, Rajya Sabha MP Mayawati tried to put pressure on the Prime Minister
 unhone kaha ki piem sansad main jabaav den, jab ve baahar bol rahe hai to andar kyon nahin
 'mayawati is becoming a contractor' After the beating of Dalit youth in Una, Gujarat, the BJP has been constantly under attack by the opposition and tried to hide its shortcomings by counting the mistakes of the previous government
 grahamantri ne vipaksh se zyada daliton kaa dil jeetne kii koshish kii
 BJP MP Udit Raj said, 'earlier such incidents used to happen more
 mayawati thekedaar ban rahi hai
 '
 
 
 or dhire-dhire bad gai saansadon kii sankhyavahin, charchaa puri hone ke baad rajnath singh ne jawaab dete hue kaha, 'ye bhram failaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he ki bijepi sarkaar aane par daliton par atyaachaar badha he
 'meanwhile, as the news of the low number of mps spread in the House, the number of honorable people gradually increased
 kareeb 4 baje saansadon kii ginati 100 paar kar gai
 Dharmendra Yadav from SP also came to speak
 lekin rajnath kaa jawaab aadha hi hua tha ki congress ne vakout kar diya
 Accused that his questions could not be answered
 iske baad bhi sadan main bolte hue rajnath ne apana bayaan puraa kiya

 Despite all the preparations, there was traffic jam on the main roads near the ghat

 But after the immersion, no one noticed the edges of the ghat
 jahaan ganpati kii tamaam murtiyon kooday main padi hui hai
 The plight of Ganapati, who was kept at home with respect for 10 days, performed aarti, offered food, and desired prayers, no one could see this plight after his immersion
 kashmiri get sthit ghat ho yaa kalindi kunj kaa ghat
 Small statues of Ganapati are lying among the garbage everywhere
 har saal murti visarjan ke baad desh bhar ke ghat, talab yahaan tak ke samandar ke kinare tuuti hui murtiyon se bhare hote hai
 Nobody pays attention to it

 Be it the time of Durga Puja or Ganapati festival, people forget that their responsibility does not end by immersing the idol in a river, pond or sea

 bharat main pehali baar dwipaksheeya shrinkhalaa khel rahe pakistan kii team 44wein minute main captain sunil chhetri or robin ke prayaas se kiye gaye gol se sakate main aa gai
 On the corner kick of Lalrindika Ralte, Robin's flick hit the bar, which Chhetri scored inside the goal but the match commissioner added it to Robin Singh's account
 robin ko khel ke 69wein minute main doosraa pilaa card milane ke kaaran maidan chhodana padaa
 Frustrated, he returned from the field
 isse bharat ko das khilaadiyon ke saath khelnaa padaa, lekin unhone pakistan ko barabari kaa gol nahin daagne diya
 Head coach Wim Koevermans said after the match that he was desperate to see how the players performed after that
 bharat ne madhyantar se thik pehle gol kiya
 India got a corner when it seemed that the whistle would blow to end the first half
 muscat main 2012 main eeffsi under-22 kwalifire main pranay haldar ke saath milakar bharat kii taraf se shandaar khel dikhaane vaale ralte kaa laharaata shaat post se laga, jise robin ne flik kiya lekin vah baar se ja laga
 At that time Chappal Chhetri hit the rebound inside the goal, but according to the referee Robin's shot had already gone inside the goal
 bharat ko 29wein minute main bhi gol karne kaa avasar mila, lekin pakistani golkeeper saaqib hanif ne phir se acha khel dikhaaya
 The trinity of Chhetri, Robin and Ralte made a great move
 chhetri ne box ke andar robin ko gend thamayi, jinhone use ralte tak bheja lekin hanif ne dive lagaakar unka shot roak diya
 Pakistan had a chance to score an equalizer early in the second half, but goalkeeper Amarinder Singh defended a threat from India by stopping a header from close on skipper Kalimullah

 It is also important that the officials of the Ministry of Forest and Environment themselves wrote on file last year that Chaturvedi fulfills all the conditions for deputation in Delhi government
 lekin baad main unki file van mantralay or swasthy mantralay main ataki rahi
 Meanwhile, on the request of Chaturvedi, the court of administrative officials repeatedly asked the committee headed by the Prime Minister to settle the matter, after which now the Modi government has asked Chaturvedi to go to Uttarakhand
 baraak obama ne pradhanmantri narendra modi kii tarif karte hue kaha ki vah garibi or garibon ke prati unke vichaaron kaa sammaan karte hai
 But a decision of the central government has served to bring disaster to the poor and sick
 sarkaar ne 108 dawaaon kii keemton se niyantran hataa liya he, jinamein tibi, cancer jaisi bimariyon kii dawaaen shaamil hai
 According to the information, with the removal of control from the government, now thousands and lakhs of rupees will be charged for medicines which are available for hundred and thousand rupees
 sarkaar ne jin dawaaon kii keemat se niyantran hataaya he, unamem tibi, aids, diabetes or dil kii bimariyon dawaaen shaamil hai
 That is, the price of these 108 drugs will not be decided by the central government anymore
 ek angreji akhbaar kii khabar ke mutabik, sarkaar ke aadesh ke baad dawaaon kii keemton main baari ijapha hua he
 For example, the price of the anti-cancer drug Glivec increased from Rs 8,500 to 1
 08 lakh rupee ho gai he
 Blood pressure medicine Plavix is also available for Rs 1,615 instead of Rs 147
 kahin raah chalate kutta na kaat lemhangi hone vaali dawaaon kii fehrist main pagal kutton ke kaatane se hone vaali beemaari rebies kii dawa kamrab bhi shaamil he
 Its price was earlier Rs 2,670, which has now increased to Rs 7,000
 bataaya jaataa he ki abhi kuch hi dinon pehle sarkaar ne neshnal pharma prising athurity (enpipe) se kuch dawaaon kii keemton par lage niyantran ko hataane kaa aadesh jari kiya tha
 In May this year, the authority directed that the prices of these drugs be reduced
 enpipie ne 800 aisi dawaaon kii suchi bana rakhi he, jinhen anivaary kaha jaataa he or unke daamon par niyantran kar rakhaa he, kyonki desh main kuch gambhir bimariyon se peedit logon kii taadaad bahut zyada he
 According to statistics of more than 40 million diabetics, the number of people suffering from diabetes in the country is more than 40 million
 isi tarah dil kii bimariyon se peedit logon kii taadaad bhi kareeb itani hi he
 The drug companies are happy with the government's decision
 unka kahana he ki ye bimaariyaan jaanaleva nahin hai
 Companies argue that when there is no control on the price of anything, then the prices of medicines should not be controlled
 america ko khush karne kii kavayaddusri ore, ek sarkari adhikari ne kaha he ki dawaaon kii keemten anaap-shanaap dhang se nahin bad sakati hai
 The government has taken the authority to control the prices of medicines from the NPPA, but has retained it
 pehle to vah companiyon ko samajha-buja kar raji karegi or agar ve nahin maane to kadam uthaaegi

 is dauraan piem modi ne desh kii puraani sarkaron ke kaamkaaj ko yaad na karne ke vipaksh ke aaropon par bhi khulkar bolaa
 PM Modi said that we always remember the contribution of the old governments, but the Congress never remembered the work of the old governments
 iskaa udhaaharan dete hue piem narendra modi ne purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi or narsimha raav kaa zikr kiya
 PM Modi said that UPA was in government from 2004 to 2014 and before it was Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government, but Congress never took Atal ji's name in Parliament
 piem modi ne kaha ki yahaan tak congress sarkaar ke dauraan narsimha raav kaa naam bhi nahin liya gaya
 Let us tell that Narasimha Rao has been the Prime Minister of the country during the Congress government before Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 piem modi ne kaha ki unke (upie) kaarykaal main narsimha raav ko bharat ratna miltaa, manmohan singh ko bharat ratna miltaa, lekin vahaan parivaar ke baahar ke vyakti ko kuch nahin miltaa
 PM Modi said that our thinking is different and that is why Bharat Ratna was decided for Pranab Mukherjee
 itnaa hi nahin congress kii aalochana karte hue piem modi ne yah bhi kaha ki upie ne kabhi manmohan singh kii uplabdhi bhi nahin bataai
 Accusing the Congress of not praising the old governments, PM Modi said that i did this twice from the Red Fort and named everyone
 unhone kaha ki main pehla piem hum jisane lalakile se kaha ki aazaadee se lekar ab tak centre or rajya kii jitani sarkarein thi desh ko aage le jane main sabakaa yogadan he
 PM Modi said that he expects the same name to come up, it is a different thing but i have always given credit to previous governments, not taken any names and maybe it may hurt someone
 piem modi ne kaha ki congress sarkaar main sirf parivaar ko hi sab kuch miltaa tha
 But we do not deny anyone's contribution
