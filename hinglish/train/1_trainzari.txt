 Facebook is in the news these days regarding data breach
 haal hi main fasebuk ne facial ricognishan feechar kii shuruyaat kii he
 Facebook also uses face recognition feature before, but this time there is a plan to use it in another way
 fasebuk kaa yah nayaa feechar isliye laayaa gaya he taaki logon ko pahchaan kii samasya na ho
 Its second purpose is to ensure that a user's photo is not misused
 iske liye fasebuk phase ricognishan kaa sahaara le rahaa he
 According to Facebook, if a user uploads your photo on Facebook under this feature, you will get a notification through the Face Recognition feature
 is notification main bataaya jayega ki fasebuk yujar ne ek photo aplod kii he jisamen aap ho sakate hai
 Recently i turned on this feature on my Facebook, no notifications were received for a long time
 achaanak 26 march ko kuch logon ne salmaan kii aane vaali film Race 3 kaa poster aplod kiya or mujhe notification milanaa shuru hua
 Since none of them tagged me in those posters and i received the notification, it was a surprise
 kyonki ek yujar aisa tha jo meri friend list main bhi nahin he
 Salman Khan and Anil Kapoor have a few more stars in this poster
 lekin fasebuk ne salmaan khan kii photo ke paas squair bana kar mujhe ye bataanaa chaha ki is photo main aap ho sakate hai
 In this, Facebook gave three options - Not Me, Ignore and Tag yourself
 maine pehla opshan chunaa
 Notifications stopped coming in a while
 isse do sawaal uthte hai – pehla ye ki fasebuk phase ricognishan kamkaise karata he or doosraa ye ki kisaadhar par fasebuk tag karata he
 Since Facebook has not claimed the Face Recognition 99 like Apple's Face ID with this feature
 9 fisadi sahi hoga
 Apple and its technology are quite different
 ek taraf aipal aapke chehre ko scan karke phase ricognish yuj karata he or iske liye company ne kai dedicated sensors die hai to duusari taraf fasebuk aapaki tasveeron ko scan or ainalise karke mashin larning ke jariye yah pataa lagaataa he ki aap koun hai
 It is not a big deal to miss in this
 lekin isse fasebuk par sawaal uthne laazmi hai
 Face recognition feature has been provided in Facebook settings, which you can enable or disable if you want
 is feechar kii shuruyaat ke saath bhi privesi exparts ne ye sawaal uthaaya tha ki fasebuk phase ricognishan feechar yugers kii privesi ke lihaaj se khatarnaak he
 But Facebook issued a statement stating that the data of face recognition would not be passed on to any third party and would be deleted within a specified time
 fasebuk kaa phase ricognishan feechar kaam kaise karata he?fasebuk kii technology photose or videos ke picksal ko ainalise karti he jisamen aapaki profile photo, videos shaamil hote hai
 a number is analyzed by analyzing what is called a Facebook template
 is template ko fasebuk duusare photose or videos se compair karata he agar ye donon match karte hai to samajhie aapaki pahchaan ho gai
 But it is understandable from this incident that this technology of Facebook is weak and there are many flaws in it which can cause problems to the common user
 meri jaankaree main maine apane fasebuk par kabhi bhi bataur profile photo salmaan khan kii tasviir nahin lagaai he, na hi main unka fain hum
 i have put Shah Rukh Khan's picture in the profile photo before and it would not have come as a surprise if i had tagged me through Facebook face recognition in Shah Rukh Khan's photo
 lekin yah ek ghatana fasebuk ke phase ricognishan kii khami ko darshaati he
 If this happens, then in the coming time, Facebook users may be flooded with such notifications, in which they will not be in the photo, Facebook will ask them to tag them

 Prithviraj had thirteen queens
 1192 isvin main basant panchami ke din hi prithviraj chouhan ne ankhen na hone ke baavjood apane dushman mohammad gori ko maut ke ghat utaar diya tha
 The manner in which Prithviraj Chauhan killed Mohammad Ghori is also very interesting and surprising

 In the first war, Ghori had to face his mouth
 kehete hai prithviraj chouhan udaar hriday vaale the or unhone yuddh main shikast dene ke baavjood gori ko jinda chhod diya
 But for the second time when there was a war in the field of Tarain, Ghori won and he did not leave Prithviraj
 vah prithviraj chouhan ko apane saath afghanistan le gaya or vahaan unki ankhen phod deen
 Ghori's vengeance did not calm down and he was determined to kill them
 Basant Panchami 2019: basant panchami ke in khaas miseges se den sabko Vasant Panchami kii badhaiprithviraj chouhan (prithviraj Chauhan) shabdabhedi baan chalaane ke ustad the
 He could shoot arrows after hearing the sound
 gori ne mrityudand dene se pehle unke shabdabhedi baan kaa kamaal dekhnaa chaha
 Prithviraj's fellow poet Chandbaradai advised Ghori to sit on a high place and sign on the tawa
 gori maan gaya or usne thik vaisaa hi kiya jaisaa ki chandbardaai ne kaha tha
 Then Chandbardai gave a message to Prithviraj: four bamboo twenty four yards, Angul Ashta proof
 ta upar sultan he, mat chuko chouhan 
basant panchami ke din kaise kii jaati he saraswati puja?prithviraj chouhan apane priy mitra chandbardaai kaa ishaara samaj gaye or unhone tanik bhi bhul nahin kii
 He guessed the distance and the direction in which Ghori is sitting with the sign of the injury on the pan and the sign of Chandbardai
 phir kya tha unhone jo baan maaraa vah sidhe gori ke seene main ja dhansa
 After this, Chandbardai and Prithviraj also killed each other and surrendered
 itihaaskaaron kii maane to 1192 isvin kii yah ghatana bhi basant panchami vaale din hi hui thi

 He had said that North Indians are the first to break the rules and feel proud by doing so
 unhone bataaya tha ki yah bayaan dilli ke ek uparajyapal ne diya tha or vah isse sahamat hai
 His protest started after Rijiju's statement came
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne unke is bayaan ke baad twit karke kaha tha, 'rigiju ji, desh ko uttar-dakshin or hindu-muslim main mat bantie

 dushmano se ladane ke liye hathiyaar jaruri he
 Today it is common to have arms factories all over the world, but do you know that the Adivasis had also made arms factories? ji haa, hinsak jaanwaron or dushmano se ladane ke liye adimanav madhya pradesh ke hoshangabad main hathiyaar banaate the
 The latest research being done by historians has revealed that the Adivans had set up a factory for making weapons on the hill of Adamgarh
 chaar kilometre lambii is pahari par rock painting se pataa chalata he ki adimanav dhunash kii tiron ke aage lagi nukili nonk pathar se banaate the
 a large number of micro-tools and weapon pieces are being found on the hill
 
 
 
 So it is not from Australia, on a rock in the Giraffesi hill, Adimanav made a picture of a giraffe thousands of years ago
 shahar ke narmada college ke itihaas vibhaag dwaara kiye ja rahe is shodh main jiraph kii tasviir ne ek or nayaa adhyay jod diya he
 Till now it is believed that the giraffe is an animal from Australia, but thousands of years ago this picture made by the Adivans on the hill of Hoshangabad sparked a new debate in the 
 talab or gufaaen bhitaaja shodh se pataa chalata he ki adimanav samuhik yuddh paddati par kaam karte the
 a pond has also been found in the foothills of the Adamgarh hill, whose water never dries
 yahi nahin yahaan gufaaen bhi hai, jinamein unke samuhik nivas kaa pramaan miltaa he
 The arms manufacturing factory was set up on the upper part of the hill by the Adivasis
 yaheen ve pattharon ko taraash kar hathiyaar banaate the
 Here the arrowhead and the spearhead leading to the nukel were constructed
 iske saath hi jaanwaron kii khaal kaatane ke liye pathar kii blade bhi banaai jaati thi
 On the hill are portraits of Lokadevi and groups of soldiers, cavalry, elephants and giraffes doing battle
 adamgarh kii pahari par hathiyaaron ke is kaarkaane or rock painting ko puratv vibhaag ne sangrakshit kar liya he
 The picture of a giraffe made by the Adivasis has brought many questions to the college historians who are doing research on the picture of the giraffe

 Professor Hansa Vyas of the history department of Narmada College says, "there was a factory for making weapons of Adimanav on the hill
" iskaa pramaan mil gaya he, lekin adimanvon ne hajaaron saal pehle jiraph ke chitra banaae hai iskaa arth yah he ki unhone jiraph dekhe the
 Although research is being done on this

 Election Results: kiske sir sajega taj? 5 rajyon ke chunavi nattejey aaj Mumbai Cricket Association president Sharad Pawar made a disclosure that is truly amazing
 iske anusaar, sachin tendulkar ne bhartiya team ko ek aisa karishmai tilism diya, jiskaa duniyabar main koi sani nahin he
 Sharad Pawar has said that it was Sachin Tendulkar who suggested the name of Mahendra Singh Dhoni as the captain
 2007 main rahul dravid ne captaini chhodane kii ichha jaahir kii thi or iske baad sachin ne dhoni ko yah jimmedaari saunpane ke liye kaha tha
 Pawar wrote in his blog, 'sachin loves to help his fellow players, especially junior cricketers and believes in team spirit
 vinamrata unka bich kaa naam he
 He left the captaincy to focus on his game
 'unhone likhaa he, ‘ab ek aisi kahani jisase sachin tendulkar or mahendra singh dhoni ke anginat prashansakon ko khushi hogi
 It was a few years ago when the Indian team was playing in England
 main bhi bisisiai pramukh hone ke naate landan main tha
 'union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar said,' One day Rahul Dravid came to me and he surprised me with his request
 dravid ne kaha ki vah captaini chhodana chaahate hai, kyonki isse unka khel prabhavit ho rahaa he
 Did not answer me directly
 twanti-20 siries jald shuru hone vaali he or vishwa cap keval ek saal baad hona he
 'he said,' How could Dravid think of giving up the captaincy at such a critical juncture
 unka uttaradhikari koun hoga? dravid apane faisle par kaayam the
 He suggested Sachin's name for the next captain
 maine is par vishay par sachin se baat kii
 He was not keen to become captain in place of Dravid
 unhone dhoni kaa naam sujhaayaa
 This gave a new twist to the story
 ’pavaar ne yaad kiya, 'dhoni behtareen wicketiper he lekin kya vah acha captain sabit hoga
 Sachin replied, 'you try him
 vah bahut acha captain sabit hoga
 i am saying this with a feeling of responsibility

 Malla has been convicted of missing duty

 The matter was going on in court martial on May 23, 2018 when the news spread that an army officer was arrested by the police from the local hotel along with an 18-year-old girl who had brought her to the hotel with the intention of sexual exploitation
 maamla tab tool pakadaa jab yah pataa chalaa hotel se pakadaa gaya afasar major litul gogoi he, jisane human shield banaaya tha

 People angry with the death in that area were stoned

 yah sab major gogoi ke kehane par hua tha
 Leetul then said that it was necessary for the army to do this to avoid the stone-pelters
 is ghatana ke baad major ko sammanit bhi kiya gaya tha
 Major had arrogance! Dar had said last year that i am thankful to Allah
 jis bande ne meraa jivan tabah kar diya, aakhirkaar use khuda ke coup kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 God has his own way of justice
 daar ne kaha ki sena ke major ko power kaa ahankaar ho gaya tha or vah apane ko khuda samajhane lage the

 In the Junior World Cup Table Tennis Championships, which lasted eight days from 29 November in the city of Vendi, France, there was also an echo of India's emergence as a superpower with balls tucking on the tennis tables
 yah vah mahashakti thi jisane china or korea jaise deshon ke teble tennis khel ke saamaan ke bazaar main dabadabe ko chunauti di he
 Behind this power of India is Stag International's factory spread over 10,000 square meters in Paratapur area of meerut, 70 km from New Delhi
 yahaan bani teble tennis kii mejon ne na keval junior valrdacap main apni quality kaa loha manvaaya balki usase pehle yah kai asian championships or rashtramandal khelon main dhooma machaa chuki hai
 57-year-old Rakesh Kohli, chairman of Stag International, is also the only person in the country who has simultaneously represented India in world-class competitions of table tennis and lawn tennis in a particular age group
 chaar baar teble tennis vishwa cap main desh kaa pratinidhitiv kar chuke kohli ek darjan se zyada inaam bhi jeet chuke hai
 His brother Vivek Kohli has also represented the country in the World Tennis Championship
 rakesh or vivek ke samarpan ke chalate unki company vishwa ke agua brands ke rup main ubhar chuki he
 In 1922, Rakesh's grandfather Arjandas Kohli started a badminton counter and football factory in Sialkot, Pakistan
 jald hi unhone tatkaaleen marathavada, assam, gujarat jaise ilaakon ke skool-collejon ko apana saamaan supplaai karnaa shuru kar diya
 After independence, Arjandas first left Delhi to settle down and later settled in Meerut in 1950
 yahaan ke kaint sthit prasiddh aughadghath ke mandir ke peeche sena kii khaali barrack main badminton kii jaali or footbal banane kaa kaarkaana kholaa
 In a short time, Arjandas again started supplying goods to schools and colleges
 in skool-collejon ko chart, nakshe jaisi chizon kii bhi jarurat thi
 Keeping this in mind, Tilak Raj Kohli, son of Arjandas and father of Rakesh, also opened an educational goods factory in 1970
 tab rakesh meerut ke saint meries academy main padhate the
 Rakesh, fond of playing table tennis, used to play table tennis at school by adding tables and keeping books between them
 bete ke junun ko dekhte hue tilkaraj ne 1975 main desh kii pehali tennis kii mej banaai
 At that time the National Institute of Sports (NIS) Patiala, the premier institution of sports in the country, approved the tennis table made by Tilak Raj as it conformed to international standards
 yaheen se duniya main “stag brands” ke chaane kii neenv taiyaar hui
 Now Tilak Raj got orders to make tennis tables from schools and colleges across the country
 tej daudaahe vaale hiran (stag) ke naam par tilkaraj ne 1978 main stag brands kii sthapana kii
 In 1975, at the age of 17, Rakesh began to arm his father and Baba
 iske baad inhone meerut vishvavidhyalay se grajuation kiya or kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay se management kii padhai kii, saath main vyavsaay bhi chalata rahaa
 During this time Rakesh played in both table tennis and lawn tennis for UP
 college stareey pratiyogitaaon main bhi hissaa liya
 Despite captaining the table tennis team of Meerut University in 1982, not being able to participate in the inter-university Championship due to suffering from chicken pox brought a turning point in Rakesh's life
 teen hakrate tak aaraam karne ke dauraan rakesh ne stag brands ko antarrashtriya str par pahchaan dilaane kaa khaakaa khinch liya tha
 First, Rakesh got his company's table-tennis table approved from the "table Tennis Federation of India"
 us vakt tak saal bhar main teble tennis kii sau megen ban paati thim
 Rakesh bagged orders for 200 tables in two months
 1985 main stag desh main teble tennis kii mej banane vaala sabase bada brands banakar ubhara
 In 1987, his table tennis tables were approved by the International Federation of Federation
 brands ke vistaar kii ranneeti ke tahat duusare khelon main bhi “stag” brands ne apni dhamak dikhaai
 Jute mattresses were made in those days for laying on the ground in sports such as wrestling, judo, gymnastics, but Stagg started making expanded polyethylene foam mattresses for the first time in the country
 iske baad isi company ne long jump or polo jaise khelon ke liye jameen par bichaai jane vaali chataayee ko pehali baar bharat main bananaa shuru kiya
 Rakesh explains, "when our company entered the world market in 1993, it was the USP to manufacture different sports goods
" ” matlab yah tha ki ek hi company ke saath ek hi container ke andar teble tennis kii mej, kushti ke gadde, baadha daud ke hardal jaise kai khelon ke saamaan mangaaye ja sakate the
 This gave the Stag a distinct identity in the international market
 antarrashtriya bazaar main pakad banane ke liye stag international brands ke saath bhi judaa
 Butterfly, the world's largest supplier of table tennis goods, buys 10,000 tables every year from the stag
 yah ek maheene main 2,000 se zyada megen banane vaali desh kii iklauti company he
 Stagg began sponsoring teams playing in the country for the first time to promote table tennis
 rakesh bataate hai, “hamane desh kii un tiimon ko sponcer kiya jinke khilaadi garib the
 "sponsor teams in places where table tennis is not very popular
 desh main stag ekmaatr company he jo duniya ke sabhi bade brands ko saamaan supplaai karti he
 The International Table Tennis Federation, which promoted table tennis, also received support from Stag
 aaj stag 100 se zyada deshon main niryaat kar rahi he

 5diarectormilap jhaverikalakaarsni leone, tushaar kapur or vir dassex kamedi bollywood main nayaa johnor he
 New experiments have started in this
 kuch filmein safal bhi rah rahi hai or kuch munh ke bal gir bhi rahi hai
 It is certain that this genre has come to Bollywood
 sirf jarurat he isse jude logon kii iske mahatv or flavor ko samajhane kii
 Hopefully, over time Bollywood will also learn that sex comedy does not just mean sex and comedy means more than just jokes shared among themselves
 sex kamedijonor main pichley hafte 'kya kool hai ham-3' ai thi to is hafte lambey samay se relies ke liye taiyaar film 'mastijade' ne dastak di he
 Milap was the color of Jhaveri in the previous film as well in this film
 milapedlt kamedifilmon ke paryaay ban chuke hai
 But they have to be a bit mature about these films and also need to do something new
 'mastijade' unhone diarect kii he
 The film has plenty of opportunities to provoke sex-related feelings with the help of symbolism and similes
 lekin kahani nahin he
 How much of Bollywood in the story has not been able to do anything new in the stories of mainstream and big budget films so far, it would be meaningless to expect high expectations from him in a new genre
 aisa hi sex kamedi 'mastijade' ke saath bhi he
 The story has its weak side
 film main paatr aate jate hai
 The jokes keep going and nowhere is the continuity felt in the film
 sirf dher saare jokes ko samet diya gaya he jo kahin-kahin gudgudate hai to kahin upar se guzar jate hai
 Then whether seeing the head of the ganja is a wrong feeling or banana, lele, a lot of similar things
 or to or pataya, jicel thakaraal or tushaar kapur ko ham pichley hafte bhi ek sex kamedi main dekh chuke hai
 This is how things look
 mastijade bharpoor sex dose liye hue he
 a strong story could have charmed the film
 star apilafilm mensoni leonor sirf sani leone hi he
 Whatever she wears or does not wear, she looks amazing
 sani film main jaan daalati najar aati hai or acting ko chhodkar jo bhi unke haath main he uski koshish karti hai
 Sunny's double dose will surely be liked by his fans
 haalanki kahin-kahin unki dialog delivery jarur tang karti he
 Producers who make sex comedy should take special care of what kind of starcast they are taking and who is their director and writer
 tushaar kapur or vir das is johnor main maahir hai lekin unheen chehron ko baar-baar vahi karte dekhnaa bahut acha nahin lagata he
 There is a good hype about 'mastizaade' about earning
 phir sani leone hai or acha mujeec bhi he
 Solid story if just missing
 single screen par pehla din pehla sho main 'laila lele' kii entry par taaliyaan or sitiyaan is baat kaa ishaara kar detii hai ki sani main darshakon ko excite karne kaa factor maujuud he
 If sources are to be believed, the film will cost around 17 crore
 main bechaa gaya he
 In such a situation, if the Sunny factor goes away and goes to see the whatsapp generation film, then the film is not going to be in loss

 com / fjwj80mkby bharat ke railway steshnon par jald aap kulhad main phir se chaay kaa anand le sakate hai
 15 years ago, former Railway Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav announced to sell tea in 'kulhar' at railway stations
 lalu kaa tark tha ki isse steshnon par gandagi nahin failegi or kulhad banane waalon ko bade paimaane par rojgaar milegaa
 But gradually plastic and paper cups replaced kulhad at railway stations
 ab rail mantri piyush goyal kulhad kii vaapasi ko lekar gambhir dikh rahe hai
 At present, those who manage food at Varanasi and Rae Bareli stations have been instructed to use terracotta or clay 'axes', glass and plates
 railway kii ore se 'kulhad' kaa aadesh jariuttar railway evam uttar purv railway ke mukhya vanijyik prabandhak board kii ore se jari paripatr main iskaa zikr kiya gaya he or vendoron ko jald se jald kulhad apnaane kaa aadesh diya gaya he
 Officials said that with this step, the travelers will not only experience freshness but will also get a bigger market for the local potters who are struggling to save their existence
 railway ke circular ke anusaar, 'jonal railway or iarsitisi ko salaah di gai he ki ve tatkaal prabhaav se varanasi or raibareli railway steshnon kii sabhi icaayiyon main yatriyon ko bhojan yaa peya padaarth parosane ke liye sthaneey taur par nirmit utpaadon, paryaavaran ke anukool terracotta yaa pakki mitti ke ‘kulhadon’, glass or platon kaa istemaal sunishchit karen taaki sthaneey kumhaar aasaani se apane utpaada bech saken
 The chairman of the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) came up with the proposal in December last year, writing a letter to Goyal suggesting that these two stations should be used to employ potters around the area
 kumhaaron ko sakasham banane kii koshishkeviisi adhyaksh ve ke saxena ne bataaya, 'hamen bijli se chalane vaale chaak die gaye hai jisase hamaari utpaadakta bad gai he, isaki madad se ham din main 100 se lekar kareeb 600 cap bana lete hai
 In such a situation, it becomes important that we get a market to sell our products and income, due to the railways agreeing on our proposal, millions of potters have now got a ready market
 'unhone kaha, 'hamaare liye yah jeet kii tarah he, samoochaa samudaay railway kaa shukraguzaar rahegaa or ummid karte hai ki aakhirkaar ham samooche rail network main iskaa istemaal kar sakenge
 He said that it is expected that the production of pottery will reach 2
5 lakhs per day to meet the demand of both stations
 kumhaar shashaktikaran yojana ke tahat sarkaar ne kumhaaron ko bijli se chalane vaale chaak vitarit kiye hai
 Varanasi is the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and around 300 such chalks have been given here and 1,000 more chalks are to be distributed
 jabaki raibareli sonia gandhi kaa sansadeey kshetra he, yahaan aise 100 chaak vitarit kiye gayi hai
 Saxena said that KVIC will also distribute around 6,000 electric chalk throughout the country this year

 In March alone, five Hindu temples were demolished and looted

 Pakistan newspaper Tribune has quoted this news from a foreign news agency

 Earlier in 2013, there were attacks on nine temples

 It is not that only Hindus are being hunted in Pakistan but Christian, Ahmadi and even Shia Muslims are being attacked
 logon kaa aarope he ki navaj sharif ke pichley saal pradhanmantri banane ke baad se halaat or badtar hote ja rahe hai

 Former Pakistan Minister Sherry Rehman said that Pakistan has failed to protect the minorities and there are two reasons for this
 pehla yah ki vahaan dharmik ashishnutaa or doosraa hinsa kii badhati vichaardhaara
 Activists say that it is attributed to the habit of tolerating terrorism
 isse un logon ko mauka miltaa he jo hinduon kii jameen hadapna chaahate hai yaa dhan lootnaa chaahate hai
 For this, they resort to religion
 vahaan ke hindu or anya alpsankhyak kah rahe hai ki navaj sharif ke jitkar aane ke baad se sthiti or bhi bigadi he
 Nawaz Sharif has a strong connection with Saudi Arabia
 vahaan wahabi islam ko mana jaataa he jo bahut kattarpanthi he or alpsankhyakon ko nichi nigahon se dekhtaa he

 The former minister and BJP leader Angad Yadav has been arrested by the police in connection with the murder of Congress leader Rajnarayan Singh last week in Azamgarh, UP
 is sambandh main mritak rajanarayan singh kii patni ne angad yadav ke khilaaf cese darj karaayaa tha
 After the arrest, Angad Yadav said that he was implicated in a political conspiracy
 unka is ghatana se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 He is running ill by himself at this time
 unke virdohi unhen sajeesh main fansaakar unhen chunaav ladane se rokna chaah rahe hai
 Let us tell you that Rajnarayan Singh (52), who was the chairman of the Cooperative Cell of Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee, was shot and killed on December 19, when he went on a morning walk outside his residence in Sidhari town
 om prakaash rajbhar kaa yogi sarkaar par hamalaa72 ghante main lagu karaaen obisi aarakshan-rajbharailahabaad hoicourt ne 17 ati pichhadi jatiyon ko daliton main shaamil karne ke sarkaar ke faisle par roak laga di he saath hi sarkaar se 3 hafte main is mudde par jawaab bhi maanga he
 After this decision of the Yogi government, there was an atmosphere of happiness among the backward castes, but as soon as the Allahabad High Court rejected this order of the government, politics has started on it
 kabhi yogi mantrimandal main shaamil rahe omprakash rajbhar ne rajya sarkaar par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki pehle to sarkaar ne dikhaane ke liye aarakshan kaa aadesh nikaala or ab apana hi aadmi khadaa kar hoicourt main ise nirast kara diya
 Challenging Omprakash Rajbhar has said that the manner in which the reservation of the general class was implemented in a jolt, in the same manner that the state government should not include these castes in the Dalit category in 72 hours or else it would be considered a move of the Jumlebaz government is
 duusari ore chunaav ke pehle endie ke saath ai nishad party ko bhi adaalat ke is faisle se jhatka laga he
 Castes like Mallah, Bind, Rajbhar, Kewat, Kashyap were demanding Dalit category from long ago
 nishad party is andolan kii agua thi
 The Nishad Party is currently with the NDA and is now demanding the government to take steps on this issue soon
 nishad party ke rashtriya adhyaksh sanjay nishad ne kaha ki ye is maamle par court ko gumraah kiya gaya he
 He said that 17 backward castes have been in the Scheduled Castes since 1961 according to the President's notification, the synonym of Manjhwar is Kewat / Sailor
 shilpkaar kii paryaayavachi kumhaar / prajapati he
 Sanjay Nishad said that some people are misleading the court and the government
 yogi sarkaar ke mantri siddharth nath singh ne kaha ki jab hamane in 17 jatiyon ko dalit jatiyon ke samaan aarakshan kaa laabh diya tab bhi hoicourt kaa aadesh mana tha or ab bhi court kaa aadesh maanenge
 Please tell that many backward castes like Mallah, Bind, Kewat, Kashyap Prajapati, Bhar, Rajbhar, Lohar are among the backward castes in UP whereas similar castes are in Dalits in many states
 isi aadhaar par adaalat ne pehle inhen dalit varg main shaamil karne ko hari jhandi di thi
 Later, the Allahabad High Court stayed the order after the present Dalit castes protested it and some people took the matter to court
 Maharashtra News: maharashtra or haryana vidhansabha ke chunaav parinaam aane ke saath yah spasht ho gaya tha ki maharashtra (maharashtra) main bijepi-shivasena (bjp-shiv Sena) kii sarkaar banane ja rahi he
 In Haryana too, no party had got an absolute majority but the BJP (BJP) emerged as a big party
 vahaan pehle yah khabar ai ki nirdaleey vidhayak milakar bijepi ke saath aaenge or bijepi kii sarkaar ban jaaegi, lekin nirdaleey vidhayakon kii suchi main ek naam gopal kanda kaa bhi tha jinpar kai aparaadhik maamalon main court main mukadmaa chal rahaa he
 When the senior leaders of the BJP came to know about this, those people also protested
 us samay uma bharti ganga pravaas par thi, unhone bhi soshal media par virodh jaahir kiya or shaam tak aate-aate yah saaf ho gaya ki bijepi nirdaleey vidhayakon ke saath milakar sarkaar nahin banaaegi
 On the other hand, Jananayak Janata Party agreed to form a government with the BJP and for the first time in Haryana, a BJP coalition government was formed
 lekin maharashtra main bijepi-shivasena ko bahumat milane ke baad bhi sarkaar nahin ban pai
 After the Maharashtra election results came, Shiv Sena started demanding the post of Chief Minister
 shivasena kii ore se yah bataaya gaya ki chunaav se pehle bijepi ne dhaai-dhaai saal mukhyamantri par sahmati di thi lekin chunaav parinaam aane ke baad bijepi apane vaade se mukar gai
 The BJP was also expected to have a talk but this hope came to an end when the Governor was informed by the BJP that the BJP was unable to form the government
 idhar centre kii modi sarkaar main shaamil shivasena kaa ekmaatr mantri arvind saavant ne kendriya mantrimandal se istipha de diya or shivasena ne endie se hatane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 The Shiv Sena then approached the NCP and indicated that it might support
 haalanki shivasena rajyapal ko kisi bhi dal kaa samarthan patr dene main naakaam rahaa lekin rajyapal se or samay die jane kii maang kii
 The Governor turned down their demand
 is bich shivasena ko samarthan die jane ko lekar congress kii dinabhar baithak hote rahi lekin koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 Sources were quoted saying that the Congress was ready to support the government from outside but it was not announced
 ensipi ke saath bhi congress kii baithak ko lekar khabar ai lekin yah spasht nahin hua ki taaja sthiti kya he
 Today the meeting of NCP mlas is being held, after which the position of NCP for forming the government will be clear
 philhal maharashtra main sarkaar gathan kaa maamla adhar main lataka hua he
 Let us tell you that in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, BJP has got 105 seats, Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44 seats
 bijepi or shivasena ne milakar bahumat kaa 145 kaa aankada paar kar liya tha
 But Shiv Sena kept demanding 50-50 formula according to which the model of running the government was two and a half years
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki bijepi ke saath samjhauta isi formule par hua tha lekin bijepi kaa daawa he ki aisa koi samjhauta nahin hua
 This led to differences so much that the two-year old friendship of the two parties was broken

 mumbai 26 / 11 aatanki hamale main shahid hemanth karkare par sadhvi pragna thakur dwaara die gaye vivaadit bayaan kaa rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke netaa indresh kumaar ne samarthan karte hue bachaav kiya he
 Indresh Kumar while addressing the press conference in Bhopal said that Pragya Thakur had shown compassion when he admitted that Hemant Karkare was a martyr
 indresh kumaar ne kaha ki tatkaaleen congress sarkaar ne agenciyon kaa galat istemaal kiya
 At the same time, people were implicated in misuse of rights to prove saffron terrorism by remaining in uniform
 unhone kaha ki hemanth karkare ko unki shahadat ke liye ham sammaan karte hai
 But on the other hand people should also keep in mind that they have tortured a sadhvi to implicate them in terrorism
 is baat ko logon ko sweekaar karnaa chahie
 At the time of the Lok Sabha elections, Bharatiya Janata Party candidate Sadhvi Pragya Thakur from Bhopal seat of Madhya Pradesh gave a controversial statement regarding Hemant Karkare, who was martyred in the Mumbai attack
 pragna thakur ne kaha ki unhone mujhe galat tareeke se fansaaya
 At the same time, Pragya had said that she has died due to her deeds
 bijepi saansad sadhvi pragna ne yaha bhi bayaan diya tha ki hemanth karkare ne unke saath kaaphi galat tareeke se vyavhaar kiya tha or galat tareeke se fansaaya tha
 Karkare died from our curse
 sadhvi boleen thi ki ye uski kutilata thi, ye deshadroh tha dharmaviruddh tha
 He used to ask me if i have to go to God for the truth, then i said that you go if you need to
 maine use kaha tha tera sarvanaash hoga, usne mujhe gaaliyaan di thim
 Young Indian batsman Virat Kohli termed the spin against England on home pitches as his biggest strength and said that the team will try to take full advantage of this weakness of the opposing team in the second ODI as well
 kohli ne match kii purv sandhya par samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ham ise (spin akraman) takat ke rup main dekh rahe hai or ham iskaa puraa phayda uthaane kii koshish karenge
 Our spinners know the conditions here well and playing them will be very difficult indeed
 unhone kaha, england pehle match main spinneron ke saamne jujhataa rahaa or visheshkar is tarah ke wicket par ham bich ke overon main uski is kamajori ko apane nishane par rakhenge
 England batsmen had a lot of trouble playing Ravinder Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin in the first match played in Hyderabad
 in donon ne teen-teen wicket lekar england ko 174 ran par dher karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Regarding the pitch of Ferozeshah Kotla, Kohli said that its nature has not changed much, but he hoped that there will be a slight bounce in the match tomorrow
 unhone kaha, yah pich hameshaa dhimi rahi he or isamen khaas oochaal nahin rahata
 However, it has improved a bit now
 bhale hi ab bhi isamen adhik oochaal nahin hoga, lekin pehle se yah behatar he
 Aaj Tak showed a sting 'operation Delhi Police' on Tuesday
 isamen dikhaaya gaya ki kaise dilli ke pulicekarmi rishwat ke paise se jeben bhar rahe hai
 The effect of this sting was that within three hours of the news running, 7 policemen were suspended and the investigation of the case was handed over to the CBI
 lekin dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne dilli police or grih mantralay kii is teji par sawaal uthaae hai
 He says that this is the first time since independence that the Delhi Police has acted so swiftly on corruption charges
 nishpaksh jaanch ko lekar shaq to hota hi he, phir bhi sibiai par bharosa karenge
 Hopefully, the culprits will be caught in the investigation
 aaj tak ke sting ‘oparation dilli police’ ke bare main kejariwal ne kaha, 'jis tarah se mangalvaar ko aaj tak channel par dilli police ke adhikariyon ko ghoose lete hue dikhaaya gaya
 This shows that the Delhi Police has become the only money collecting machine in Delhi
 ye paisa upar tak jaataa he
 To where 
 
 ye to jaanch ke baad hi pataa chalegaa
 "he said," When the policemen were shown taking money in a sting on TV yesterday, i immediately spoke to my chief secretary and he spoke to the Anti Corruption Department
 hamane tay kiya tha ki maamle par dilli sarkaar karrwai karegi
 Those accused of taking bribe will be arrested
 'kejariwal ne aage kaha, 'dilli sarkaar ke anti karpshan branch ke paas dilli police ke bhrashtachar kii jaanch karne kaa adhikaar he
 This was our idea
 jaise hi hamane ye tay kiya to duusari taraf se dilli police or grih mantralay ne teji ke saath ection liya
 i do not think that there has been such a rapid action on any issue since independence
 tivi program ke dauraan hi dilli police ne grih mantralay ko chitti likh di ki sibiai ko cese refer kar diya jaae
 The Ministry of Home Affairs also handed over the investigation to the CBI
 badi acchhee baat he ki desh kii mashinari ab itani teji se kaam kar rahi he, par shankaa to hoti he
 "the Chief Minister of Delhi said about the investigation," there is doubt in the mind about a fair investigation
 dilli police grih mantralay ke adheen he, sibiai bhi grih mantralay ke adheen he
 Is it at all an attempt to save the whole matter? ham raajnneeti nahin karnaa chaahate
 If the CBI is investigating, they should
 ham jaanch par najar banaae rakhenge or iske nateezon kaa intjaar rahegaa

 The time has come when the opposition parties will have to devise new concepts and fundamental techniques to fight the influential forces of Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Hindutva which have completely changed the meaning of politics
 is safalataa kaa puraa shrey modiko jaataa he, unhone jo safaltaapurvak gujarat main kiya se rashtriya str par doharaaya
 Politics pundits like me were thinking that Modi would not be able to play the same magic again at the center, but that is his talent
 main hameshaa unke raajnneeti karne ke tareeke or unki vichaardhaara kii aalochana karata rahaa hum, lekin yah to maananaa hi padegaa ki wo koi paaramparik netaa nahin hai
 And today he is the only hero of this big victory, although two more 'M' are with him - machine and media
 ye do aise hathiyaar hai jinhone unki ek majboot kaalpanik chhavi garh di he
 By December 2018, when the BJP had lost three of its northern states - Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, the party had weakened
 aise main modi ne turant gear badale or nai patakatha likh di
 He not only sang the achievements of his government, but also revived nationalism
 rashtrawaad unke shastraagaar kaa mukhya shastr ban gaya
 Modi was new when Modi was made the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 kuch kade aalochak kehete the ki modi ne apana pehla vidhansabha chunaav 2002 ke dangon kii vajah se jeeta tha
 But his consecutive 2007 and 2012 victories proved his involvement and strength with voters
 koi or netaa hota to vah laaparvaah ho jaataa
 On the other hand, Modi knew that as long as his image was defined by the Gujarat riots, he could not go further
 unhone gujarat ke rashtrawaad ke saath apni hindutv chhavi ko jode rakhaa
 Along with this, he coined the metaphor of development
 unase pehle kisi bhi netaa ne idanti politics or logon kii aarthik jaruraton ko ekikrut karne kaa prayog nahin kiya
 Modi's 'gujarat model' was successfully brought to the national level
 apane pichley paanch saalon main wo aarthik front par vifal rahe hai lekin unke vikaas kaa alankaar kabhi dhoomil nahin hua
 He rebutted all claims of the opposition and experts, he stood firm in his claim that under his leadership India touched new heights and became a nation with a fast growing economy
 us samay jab vah kamjor lag rahe the, balakot straw kaam kar gai
 Modi was a smart man who managed to convey the message to the people of India that the country changed under his leadership and that India is also responding strongly
 sadakon par yah suna ja saktaa tha, "hamane pakistan main ghuskar unhen maaraa
 "this powerful nationalism was exaggerated by his friends in the media
 shuruyaat se hi tivi channelon ne unki aalochana karne se inkaar kar diya or rashtrawaad ke mudde par to ve hakeekat main unke mukhpatr ban gaye
 In the same way, the same thing was happening on whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms
 modi kii sena vastav main ajey thi jo is kahani mathti rahi ki modi hi vahi netaa hai jisaki jarurat bharat ko phir se he or desh unke haathon main bhayrahit or surakshit he
 Constantly denying the opposition and Modi's glorification day by day directly benefited the BJP
 or amit shah ke sanghathanaatmak kaushal ke saath, bijepi ne apane cader or tiimon ko vishaal, acchhee tarah se tel lagi mashiinon main tabdeel kar diya
 The combination of Modi, machine and media has completely changed the Indian electoral process
 is sangyojan ne jati kii pahchaan kii raajnneeti ko bhi janm diya he
 Just as the Hindu identity has partially overwhelmed the small caste identity
 agar upi kaa parinaam kisi tarah kaa ishaara he to bispi or espi jaisi paatiyon ko apni ranneetiyon par phir se vichaar karnaa hoga
 After implementing the Mandal Commission's suggestions, caste politics especially on OBC and Dalit politics had increased
 mulaayam, lalu, kanshi ram or mayawati pahchaan kii raajnneeti ke nae yoddha the
 And his caste politics did not allow Hindutva to progress beyond one point
 lekin ve viksit hona or badhanaa bhul gaye
 Mulayam was an OBC leader but due to his short-sightedness he remained as the leader of the Yadavas
 thik isi tarah mayawati bhi jatvon se aage nahin bad pain
 With the economic boom and spread of democratic consciousness, these leaders have failed to expand their caste and a new alliance proved disastrous for them
 is bich, modi or shah rajbhar or nishadon jaisi choti jatiyon ke netaaon ko makul banane main kaamyaab rahe
 The big question today is whether Hindutva has put BJP in the place where the Congress was earlier during Indira and Nehru? Some facts have to be accepted
 modi nit hindutv nai sattararudh vichaardhaara he or kisi bhi duusari raajnneetik vicharadhara ke liye ise baahar nikaalnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 In order to fight the huge elected machine of BJP, the opposition will have to make a similar efficient machine
 or sabase badhkar netaaon ko yoddha jaisi niyat lani hogi
 Modi is successful because he fights to win
 aisa rahul gandhi yaa kisi or ke bare main nahin kaha ja saktaa
 After winning the battle, Modi does not rest but he moves towards the next stop
 unke liye raajnneeti chirkaalik yuddh he or vipaksh chirkaalik shatru jise kisi bhi keemat par parrast karnaa he

 The last rites of former External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj were performed with full state honors at the Dayanand crematorium in Lodhi Road on Wednesday
 bhaajapa kii varisht netaa sushamaa swaraj (67) kaa mangalvaar ko dil kaa daura padane ke baad nidhan ho gaya tha
 In 1998, Sushma Swaraj's name was announced as the Chief Minister of Delhi
 naam kii ghoshnaa hote hi sushamaa swaraj raajnneeti ke gur seekhney sabase pehle madan laal khurana ke ghar gai thim
 Madan Lal Khurana's son and BJP leader Harish Khurana said that at 7:00 am, Sushma Swaraj had come to learn politics from her father
 harish ko naanaa ne bataaya ki madan laal khurana ne sushamaa swaraj ko samajhaayaa tha ki bataur siem shaam ke samay daure karne shuru karo
 According to Harish Khurana, in the evening, Sushma Swaraj often did surprise inspections because this advice was given to her by the late Madanlal Khurana
 bijepi netaa harish khurana ne bataaya ki dilli main pyaaj ke bade hue daamon ko niyantrit karne ke liye sushamaa swaraj ne PDS system ko lagu kiya tha
 According to Harish Khurana, on the advice of Madan Lal Khurana, Sushma implemented this system in Delhi
 harish khurana bataate hai ki madan laal khurana or sushamaa main bhai-bahan kaa rishta tha
 Both were fond of Delhi's chaat-dumplings
 harish khurana ke mutabik sushamaa swaraj har kaaryakarta ko uske naam se pahachaanati thim or har kaaryakarta ko izzat diya karti thim
 Madan Lal Khurana's son says that i used to call Sushma Swaraj Jr
 Khurana and 10 days ago he told me that you should carry forward the legacy of Madan Lal
 bataa den ki nidhan ke baad sushamaa swaraj ke parthiv sharir ko buudhvaar ko bhaajapa mukhyalay main rakhaa gaya, jahaan logon ne unhen shradhanjali di
 After this, he was cremated at Dayanand crematorium on Lodhi Road

 While opposing the introduction of the Triple Divorce Bill in Parliament by the Central Government, All India majlis-e-ittehad ul Muslimeen President and Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi said that Muslim women would be unjust if the bill is passed
 ovaisi ke mutabik bill se moolbhoot adhikaron kaa hanan ho rahaa he or yah kanoon muslim mahilaon ke saath anyaay hoga
 Learn what Owaisi said against the triple divorce bill ovaisi ke mutabik islam main talaak e biddat pehle se gaiyrkanoonee he
 At the same time, a law against domestic violence already exists in the country
 aisi sthiti main kisi nae kanoon kii desh main jarurat nahin he

 3
 ovaisi ne kaha ki sarkaar kaa bill kanoonee taur par lachar he
 According to Owaisi, there are many provisions in the bill that are not rational with some existing laws
 ise bhi padhein: nae saal main asia kii ye paanch ghatnaayen bajaati rahengi khatre kii ghanti4
 According to Owaisi, Parliament does not get the right to make laws on this issue simply because the fundamental rights are being violated
 5
 According to Owaisi, before proposing any new law on triple talaq in Parliament, the central government needs to debate the issue among the public
 6
 Owaisi said that the party concerned in the Saira Ban case opposed the criminalization of divorce-e-biddat
 ise bhi padhein: YEAR ENDER: 2017 main iconomi kaa barometer, de rahaa sateek jayja7
 Owaisi said that the Domestic Violence Act 2005 in the country is already giving women the protection that is to be given through this new proposed law of the government
 maujuuda act ke tahat mahilaon ko mentenens, castady or conmpansheshan kaa adhikaar pehle se maujuud he lihaaja kisi nae kanoon kii jarurat nahin he

 At present, the discussion which is most hot in the Fijas of the country is nothing but Honeypreet
 gurmeet ram rahim kii is munhaboli beti kii hakeekat jaanakar yaa to log hairat main hai yaa uskaa or gurmeet kaa rishta logon ke liye ek majaak ban chukaa he
 Overall, Honeypreet has dominated from TV to social media from newspaper to website
 lekin ham aapako bataa den ki jitna aap haniprit ke bare main jaanate hai, wo kuch bhi nahin he, balki uski kahani to kuch or hi he
 The secret lies in the disappearance of Honeypreet, the secret lies in all her life
 haniprit kaa naam bhi ek raaj he
 Honeypreet has a sister and a brother besides her parents
 21 july 1980 ko haryana ke fatehabad main paidaa hui
 The father was a businessman, so he thought that he would make something to read
 haniprit ne padhai to kii magar uskaa istemaal kuch banane main nahin balki gurmeet ko baba banane main karne lagi, kyonki baba ke sahare ye baby pehle bollywood or phir hollywood main chaa jane ke khwab dil main paal rahi thi
 Honeypreet did not always have this name and this identity, it was all given to her mouthful father
 gurmeet singh ke kareeb aane se pehle haniprit kuch or thi
 When she was studying in school, her name was Priyanka Taneja
 us daur main priyanka taneja ke skool kii principal bhi yah jaanakar hairaan hai ki unke saath padhane vaali sharmili or gharelu ladki hi aaj kii haniprit he
 The house of Fatehabad in Haryana is a witness to the life of Hanipreet from her childhood to her engagement
 ek arsa pehle haniprit isi ghar main apane parivaar ke saath rahati thi
 She used to come to the streets of Jagjivanpura like a common girl
 yahi makaan or yahi galiyaan pehali baar haniprit kii jindagi main gurmeet ram rahim kii dhamaakedaar entry kii chamak se chaundhiya gaye the
 Actually Honeypreet alias Priyanka Taneja's family was already attached to the camp
 haniprit ke dada dere main prashaasak kaa kaam dekhte the
 When Honeypreet got engaged from Fatehabad's house, Gurmeet Ram Rahim himself came to attend the ceremony
 ram rahim kaa ruaab or chakachaundh tab pehali baar fatehabad ke logon ne dekha
 At his reception, the entire locality was decorated like a bride
 haniprit kii sagaibhale hi fatehabad se hui thi, lekin shaadi baba kii saraparasti main uske sirsa ke dere par hi hui thi or haniprit kii shaadi ke baad achaanak uskaa puraa parivaar fatehabad main apana basaa basaaya ghar chhodkar sirsa main baba ram rahim ke dere main chale gaye
 According to sources, even before Baba came to the shelter and before Honeypreet came close to Baba, her mother had accepted Baba as her God and on that insistence, the family moved from Fatehabad to the camp in Sirsa
 jis shahi andaaj main gurmeet singh uski sagaai main pahunchaa tha usase pataa chalata he ki haniprit ko lekar uske dil main khaas jagah bahut pehle se thi
 This place became more special with the passage of time
 naubat yahaan tak aa gai ki apni khud kii do-do betiyon or ek bete ke hote hue gurmeet ne haniprit ko god lekar duniya ke saamne use apni beti banane kaa elaan kar diya, vah bhi haniprit kii shaadi ke puure 9 saal baad
 Honeypreet was not only close to Baba, but she was a punchcard without which the door of Baba's tent would not open
 gurmeet ke jaisaa to nahin magar gurmeet se kam bhi uskaa rutaba nahin tha
 Now in the world of Gurmeet, his hank and the kingdom of billions of trillions have almost looted
 khud haniprit ek luti hui riyasat kii ujadi hui maharani kii tarah agyatavaas main kahin bhatak rahi he
 But that princely name of Baba was Gulzar till August 25
 tab haniprit kaa rutaba vahaan kisi maharani se kam nahin tha
 Honeypreet was not only the closest to Baba, but she is also Ram Rahim and Dera's biggest royal
 baba ram rahim koi bhi faisla lene se pehle sirf haniprit se hi salaah letaa tha
 This baby of Baba held all the keys of the camp
 paise se lekar har wo faisla jo dere se sambandhit hota tha, wo haniprit kii karti thi
 Honeypreet handled the film production of Ram Rahim
 baba kii sari filmein haniprit ne hi diarect kii thim

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday met Comptroller and Auditor General Shashi Kant Sharma regarding the speedy checking of accounts of private power distribution companies
 kejariwal ke saath dilli ke bijli mantri satyendra jain bhi maujuud the
 This is the second time Kejriwal has met the CAG on this issue
 isse pehle unhone dilli ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lene ke baad is masale par kaig pramukh se baatcheet kii thi
 According to Delhi government sources, the Delhi government asked Sharma on the audit of finance of the power distribution companies to review the electricity tariff after the conclusion of the Delhi government's approach and audit of its plans
 pichley saal janvari main aam aadmi party kii pehali sarkaar ne teen bijli companiyon bisies yamuna power li
 , BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd
 or tata power dilli distribution li
 CAG audit was ordered
 iske saath hi bijli vitaran companiyon ko yah chetavanee bhi di gai thi ki lekhapariksha jaanch main sahyog nahin karne par unke license bhi radd kiye ja sakate hai
 The AAP government had ordered audit of power distribution companies since 2002
 2002 se hi bijli kaa nijeekaran kiya gaya tha
 Delhi has 51 and 49 per cent joint venture between private and Delhi government in power distribution companies
 abhi tak kendriya karmchaariyon ko hi adhiktam 20 lakh rupee tak gracuty milti he
 But the government has recommended that people working in the private sector should also benefit from it
 cabinet se prastaav paas hone ke baad ab ise bajet satr ke agle hisse main sansad main vidheyak ke rup main pesh kiya jayega
 The Seventh Pay Commission had recommended raising the limit of gratuity from ten to twenty lakhs
 centre sarkaar ke saath-saath kai rajya sarkarein bhi ise lagu kar chuki hai
 It has now been agreed to implement it in the private sector also
 shrammantri bandaaru dattatreya kii adhyakshata main hui baithak main yah faisla liya gaya
 It was agreed in the meeting that such a bill should be brought in the Parliament that whenever there is an increase in the amount of gratuity of the central workers, the gratuity in the private sector should also increase automatically
 iske liye nayaa vidheyak laane kii jarurat naa pade
 Representative of AITUC d
 el
 Sachdeva said that labor organizations have demanded to implement the increased limit of gratuity from 1 January 2016
 is prastaav main ek ahm baat yah bhi he ki 20 lakh tak kii gracuty kii nikasi par koi tex nahin dena hoga
 An employee becomes entitled to gratuity if he leaves after working in a company for five years

 The extreme rightist Le Pen has also been backed by US newly elected President Donald Trump
 mana ja rahaa he ki is dilachasp mukaable main kisi ke bhi jeet kaa andaja lagaana mushkil ho rahaa he
 Therefore, supporters of right-winger Marine Le Pen have still not given up hope of victory
 raashtrapati kii daud main shaamil lee pen agar jeetne main agar kaamyaab ho jaati hai to desh main maujuud muslim varg ke liye kai museebataan khadi ho jaaengi
 Le Pen will be the first female president of France after winning

 Actually, it will be easier to keep an eye on the refuges coming into the country
 lee ne kaha ki france main rifusiyon ko ghar mili hue hai or france ke mul nivaasiyon ke paas rahane ke liye chat nahin he
 If she wins, then there will be a change in this situation

 Our team feared arrest so we gave a demo in the assembly
 agar ham giraftaar ho jate to ham janata ko iviem ko hack karke dikhaane kaa mauka kho dete
 Saurabh Bhardwaj said that we will hack the EVM in front of the Election Commission and show it
 agar chunaav ayog ke saamne hack nahin kar paae to jo sazaa chunaav ayog degaa vah manjuur hogi

 is dauraan saurabh ne daawa kiya ki 'ek sikret code ke zarie hoti he EVM se chhedchhad sambhav he
 The code is secretly inserted during voting
 code daalane ke baad har vot ek khaas party ko jaataa he
 The mother board of the EVM can be tampered with by changing
 koi aisi mashin nahin, jiske saath chhedchhad na kii ja sake
 This tempering is not easy to catch
 enditivi se saurabh bharadwaj kii khaas baatcheet This machine is a replica of ec's EVM
 Our team was afraid of arrest, so the demo was given in the assembly
 If we were arrested, we would have lost the chance of the Election Commission to hack EVM
 We didn't do it for political motives
 How light is the process of elections on which the whole democracy rests: The Election Commission will have to strengthen the process of convincing the people
 The work is not only to conduct elections but also to give confidence to the people
bjp and Election Commission are meeting
 No question was raised on the election of Rajya Garden
 We did not question the bjp's 2014 victory
 The BJP was overconfident in Delhi 2015 and Bihar 2015 so tempering will not be conducted in the truth
 The lie will be mixed only then it will be trusted, there is difference between theft and robbery
 We will show EVM in front of Election Commission by hacking if Election Commission If you do not hack in front of us, then the punishment which will be given by the Election Commission will be approved ullekhneey he ki dilli sarkaar ne mangalvaar ko vidhansabha kaa vishesh satr bulaayaa, jisamen aam aadmi party ke vidhayak saurabh bharadwaj ne ek iviem tip mashin kii live tempring kaa live demo dikhaaya
 During this, Saurabh claimed that 'EVM tampering is possible through a secret code
 voting ke dauraan code chupake se daal diya jaataa he
 After entering the code, every vote goes to a particular party
 EVM kaa madar board badalakar chhedchhad kii ja sakati he
 No machine that cannot be tampered with

 Motera hero Harbhajan Singh strengthened his position in the second Test cricket match by gaining a crucial 86-run lead over New Zealand here today with a strong move towards another century and VVS Laxman's half-century
 apane 14 saal ke karier main pehali baar apane gharelu shahar main khel rahe lakshmana ne apni kalatmak ballebaaji kaa acha namoona pesh karke 74 ran kii sanyamit pari kheli jabaki harbhajan ne visphotak tewaron ke saath naabad 85 ran banaaye jisase bharat tisare din kaa khel samaapt hone tak nau wicket par 486 ran banane main safal rahaa

 This is the new record for tenth wicket partnership between the two countries
 harbhajan ne ab tak apni pari main 82 gend kheli tathaa saat chauke or paanch chakke lagaaye hai jabaki lakshmana kii 160 gend kii pari main 11 chauke shaamil hai
 Both of them avoided India's defeat by sharing 163 runs for the seventh wicket in the first Test match in Ahmedabad

 India added 59 runs in the first and Dravid and Laxman, meanwhile, did not allow New Zealand a second success
 dravid duusare satr ke shuru main do chauke jadkar ardhashatak ke kareeb pahunche lekin tabhi tim southi kii teji se middle stump kii taraf badhati gend par pagabaadha out ho gayi
 He played 144 balls and hit five fours

 Till the tea break, Laxman did not give any bowler any chance but returned to the pavilion in the third session without adding any runs to his score
 vah kris martin kii sidhi gend ko modane se chook gayi jo unhen pagabaadha out kar gayi
 Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (14) made an easy catch to Brandon mccullum on the short cover off Vettori's flight, but Harbhajan started in an aggressive manner
 unhone vittori par do chauke jadne ke baad martin ko bhi yahi sabak sikhaaya lekin jahir khan ke aane ke baad unke paas adhik strike nahin rahi
 Zaheer bowled Southee at fine leg and played 37 balls before being caught and scored seven runs
 jahir ke out hone ke turant baad barish aa gayi jisase pandrah minute tak khel rukaa rahaa
 Another Hyderabad cricketer Pragyan Ojha (0) was run out soon but Harbhajan entertained the spectators with two consecutive sixes in this over of Vettori
 unhone isi gendbaaj par ek ran lekar keval 41 gend par apana nauvaan test ardhashatak puraa kiya
 He was able to cross the 50-run mark in the third consecutive innings in this series

 deshbhar main 2 sitambar, 2019 ko ganesh chaturthi kaa parv badi dhoomdhaam se manaaya gaya
 After this people have started Ganpati immersion as per their customs
 kai log ganpati visarjan ganesh chaturthi ke das din baad karte hai, jabaki kuch log pehle bhi puja puri karke visarjan kar dete hai
 Meanwhile, a video on social media about Ganapati immersion is becoming increasingly viral
 kya he daavaviral ho rahe video ke saath daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki ahmedabad kii sabarmati nadi main ganpati visarjan par pratibandh lagane par logon ne murtiyon ko footpath par hi chhod diya he
 The video is made from a moving car showing hundreds of idols of Gods and Goddesses placed on the pavement
 kya he sachindia today ke anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne apni padtaal main paaya ki is video kaa ganpati visarjan se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 The video is from the Sabarmati river in Ahmedabad, but is about a month old when Dasha Maa was celebrated in the city
 video ko is bhraamak daawey ke saath hajaaron log share kar chuke hai
 a Facebook user named Padmini Natarajan posted this video on Saturday, which has been shared by more than 7,400 people so far
 is video ko lekhak or raajnneetik vishleshak Zainab Sikander ne bhi twit karte hue aapatti jataai he
 At the risk of being called a jihadi terrorist for simply voicing my opinion on an environmental issue, may i please just ask those who do the Ganpati Visarjan in natural water bodies: WHY you cannot use eco-friendly, biodegradable (non-toxic paint) idols? pic

 com / emhijic31t — Zainab Sikander (@zainabsikander) September 7, 2019 On how to investigate Italian videos, we got a Twitter thread from India TV journalist, Decision Kapoor, about the viral video
 unke mutabik yah video ganesh visarjan kaa nahin, balki ek maheene pehle ahmedabad main hue dasha maa kii murtiyon ke visarjan ke samay kaa he
 Ahmedabad is changing
 ant tak padhiyegaa
 Every picture has two sides
 do dinon se kai log mujhase is video kii sachai ke bare main jaananaa chaah rahe hai
 i am writing for this sabase pehle saaf kar duun ki vidio ganesh visarjan kaa nahi he
 One month old Dasha is at the time of immersion of mother @ vnehra1 / 5pic

 com / i4g682yuwx — Nirnay Kapoor (@nirnaykapoor) September 9, 2019 The judgment says that the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has banned the immersion of any kind of idols in the Sabarmati river
 isi ko dekhte hue pichley maheene logon ne dasha maa kii murtiyon ko nadi ke paas footpath par chhod hi diya tha, jinhen baad main nagar nigam ne vahaan se hataakar khaas tareeke se visarjeet kar diya
 The decision has also stated that this time Ganapati immersion in Ahmedabad will take place on 12 September for which 61 huge pools have been built
 ahmedabad nagar nigam kamishnar vijay nehra ne bhi nirnay kii baat ko sahi bataaya he
 Vijay Nehra has also retweeted an old tweet in which he shared some pictures and a video about Dasha Maa's immersion
 twit share karte hue vijay ne likhaa he ki viral video ke saath kiya ja rahaa daawa galat he or isi tarah ke video or tasviren unhone ek maheene pehle twit kii thim
 i shared this one month ago

 co / yxir8l46zr— Vijay Nehra (@vnehra)september 9, 2019vijay nehra ne ye twit 11 agast ko kiya tha
 Looking at the tweeted photos and videos, it is clearly understood that the viral video is also of the same time
 in tasveeron main bhi devi devataaon kii murtiyon viral video kii tarah footpath par rakhi hui dekhi ja sakati hai
 We also talked to Vijay Nehra himself about this
 unka kahana tha ki ahmedabad nagar nigam ne paryaavaran diwas ke dauraan svachh sabarmati naam se ek abhiyaan chalaaya tha
 After that, any type of idols are immersed in the Sabarmati river
 isliye is abhiyaan ke baad dasha maa kii murtiyon nadi main visarjan karne aae logon ne murtiyon sabartamati riverfrant ke baahar hi rakh di thim
 These statues later merge the municipal corporation with its own nature
 hamaari ahmedabad sanvadata gopi ghanghar ne bhi sabarmati river front par pahunch kar jaanakri ko pukhta kiya ki vahaan par ganpati visarjan ke liye murtiya nahin rakhi gai hai
 It is clear here that the video which has been viral by telling of Ganapati immersion is actually a month old video and Dasha Maa is associated with idol immersion
 agar in par najar daali jaae to ye aapas main kaaphi bhinn hai
 These are the personalities that have their own thinking, discordant abilities and differences with alliances
 lekin ek baat jo inke bare main kahi ja sakati he, vah ek hi saamaajik-aarthik aadhaar se apane liye samarthan jutaney kii he
 The trio of Bihar politics, Lalu Prasad Yadav, Ram Vilas Paswan and Nitish Kumar, the caravan of three is moving in the same direction
 yani teenon kaa lakshya ek hi he lekin raste juda-juda
 These politics, guided by the same philosophy and running with their political ambitions, have to be established, but only the politics of Bihar dominates
 bas, yaheen se samasya kaa janm hota he kyonki sheersh par hameshaa kam jagah hoti he or vahaan itani jagah nahin he ki teen-teen rajnatik samaa saken
 This is what makes these three paths different
 khaas baat yah ki jepi andolan se ubhare ye teenon netaa aaj bihar main rajnatik rup se taqatvar bananaa chaahate hai
 As a result of this, a lot of them are at stake in the current Lok Sabha elections
 agar baat paryvekshakon kii karen to unka maananaa he ki lalu prasad or paswan ke liye loksabhaa chunaav na sirf apane lakshya tak pahunchane kaa jariya hai balki rashtriya raajnneeti main bane rahane kii drushti se bhi ahm hai
 It will not be an exaggeration to say that there is a situation like Lok Sabha Election or Die for them
 yah chunaav bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke liye bhi kisi bhi tarah se kam mahatvapurn nahin he kyonki nattejey hi bataaenge ki ve dilli main sheersh kursi ke kaaphi kareeb hai yaa bihar main unhen ab bhi bahut kuch karne kii jarurat he
 Not only this, if the results go well in favor of the Janata Dal (united), analysts believe that Nitish may also think of parting with his ally BJP
 ab bihar main teen charnon kaa matdaan khatm ho chukaa he or chauthe charan main rajya kii 40 main se maatr teen loksabhaa siton ke liye chunaav hona he sabhi ke dilonki dhadakanen tej ho gai hai
 Everyone is waiting whether the wave of public is with Nitish Kumar or with lalu-paswan alliance
 inaki ranneetiyon or bihar main inke liye lage daanv tathaa inaki raah kii baadhaon kaa akalan karne kaa yahi sahi samay he
 Naturally, all three have a lot at stake
 aaj lalu prasad, joki 2005 main nitish kumaar ke netritv main rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) ke haathon rajya main satta kho baithe the, raajnneeti main apana rutaba kaayam rakhane ke liye har haal main loksabhaa chunaav main behatar pradarshan karnaa chaahate hai
 If seen, Lalu Prasad and Paswan's stature in national politics is the only reason for their position in the Lok Sabha
 inako mili kendriya mantri ke pad bhi inhen aankadon ke khel kaa nateeja he
 Only when these two veterans realized the danger, they once again decided to join the Lok Sabha elections for which lalu-paswan had to make many sacrifices
 unamem se hi ek he, lalu prasad kaa apane saale sadhu yadav ko tikat na dena jis par sadhu congress main shaamil ho gaye
 This time, unlike the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, Lalu Prasad has no other hope from anywhere as he had additional support to depend on as he had his own government in the state at that time
 lekin aaj unke shatru patna par raaj kar rahe hai
 Worse, those who were once friends (congress) are standing in front of the challenge today
 lalu ko dar he ki agar ve loksabhaa main acchhee-khaasi sankhya main siten jutaney main asafal rahete hai to chunaav ke baad sonia gandhi ke samaksh bhi unka kad ghat jayega
 That is why the RJD chief has enough reasons to be upset
 haalanki congress ke varisht netaa pranab mukherjee yah saaf kar chuke hai ki lalu prasad ab bhi upie kaa hissaa hai
 However, he had earlier also said that the Railway Minister would not be a part of the next government, so that the warning signs for the former king of Bihar were clearly hidden
 isi tarah, paswan bhi bihar kii raajnneeti main swayambhu kingmekar hai or khud kii najar main desh ke sheersh pad ke liye ek yogya ummidavaar bhi
 But it will also be considered, he is the head of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and he has only four mps in the Lok Sabha
 aise main 2009 main paswan ke upar sambhavit sahyogiyon ke bich kargar or maang main rahane kii jimmedaari or adhik bad gai he
 It is for this reason that Paswan, after initially setting fire against the RJD chief, finally embraced him as his great ally in Bihar
 vaise bhi paswan ko gathbandhan isliye bhi raas aate hai kyonki unke paas bihar main ''ek patibaddh vot bank'' hone ke baavjood, record is ore ishaara karte hai ki kendriya ispaat mantri grih rajya main apane dam par bahut kam upasthiti rakhte hai
 Evidence is recorded in history
 november 2005 ke vidhansabha chunaav ko hi lijie, jisamen unhone akele chunaav ladaa tha, or vahi sabase adhik ghate main rahe the
 He had won only 13 seats while he won 29 seats in the February 2005 election
 yahi nahin, unki party maujuuda loksabhaa chunaav main 12 siton par chunaav lard rahi he, agar ve acchhee-khaasi sankhya main siten nahin jitate hai to unke liye aane vaala samay manamafik nahin rahane vaala
 Anyway, the old records make it clear that the Congress is such a party that equalizes its account at the first opportunity
 agar 14veen loksabhaa par najar daali jaae to usamen mulaayam singh yadav, jinke paas 39 siten thim, jaise bade khilaadi ko chhodkar congress ne aisi partiyon ko sarkaar main shaamil hone kaa nimantran diya jinke paas kam siten thim
 This was the Congress's answer as the Samajwadi Party did not support the Congress after the Vajpayee government fell in April 1999
 yah saaf sanket hai ki congress bhuulane or dagaabaaziyon ko maaf karne main yakeen nahin rakhti
 This is also bad news for lalu-paswan
 isamen bhi koi tajjub nahin ki chunaav ke baad haashiye par pahunchane se bachane ke liye lalu-paswan ne trek badalte hue desh ke sheersh pad ke liye ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar kaa samarthan karnaa bhi shuru kar diya he
 lalu-paswan, who along with Mulayam Singh Yadav has formed the Fourth Front some time back, is supporting Pawar for several reasons
 patna ke rajnatik galiyaaron main to yah khabar bhi he ki agar laalkrishna adwani kaa pradhanmantri banane kaa khwab adhuraa rah jaataa he to nitish kumaar ko bhi is pad kii daud main shaamil mana ja saktaa he
 Nitish is believed to be largely accepted among regional parties
 lekin agar lalu-paswan sharad pavaar kaa samarthan kar dete hai or unhen tisare morche kaa samarthan mil jaataa he to nitish kii sambhaavnaaen aasaani se dhul main mil sakati hai
 This is the reason why the two stalwarts of Bihar's politics are trying their best
 isse yah sanket bhi milte hai ki lalu-paswan ko congress ke netritv vaali upie sarkaar main shaamil hone ke alaava tisare morche ke saath janaa bhi sweekaar hoga
 There is no problem for Nitish Kumar to remain - he has increased his stature ever since he took power in the state
 yahi nahin unhone rajya main rajg ke liye ji-jaan se prachaar kiya he kyonki unke paas yahi mauka he jab ve yah siddh kar saken ki unki rajnatik haisiyat baaki donon (lalu-paswan) se upar ho gai he
 Unlike lalu-paswan, Nitish never expressed any desire for the top post in the country, but he is also known to keep his cards hidden till the last moment
 yah bhi sabko pataa he ki nitish chunaav nahin lard rahe lekin unhone prachaar ke liye koi kor-kasar baaki nahin rakhi
 This gives an indication of how much is at stake
 jaahir he, nitish ne ye atirikt prayaas ummidavaaron ke behatar pradarshan ke liye hi kiye hai
 If Nitish's politics is looked at, it becomes clear that he believes more in personality-based politics like lalu-paswan
 in chunaav main jad(you) ne jo kuch kiya-jorge furnandis or digvijay singh ko tikat na dene se lekar nalanda main kaushalendra sareekhe nae khilaadi ko tikat dena-vah isi ore ishaara bhi karata he
 Not only this, when Nitish is not the party president, but he did not lower his image from the party president in any way
 yahi nahin, unke peshevraana andaaj or rajnatik auchity ke neeche, ek aisa shaks he jisane apane kariyar ke safar main kadi mehnat kii he
 In Patna, Nitish puts his big plans into practice
 isi kaa nateeja he ki unhone aise dost chune hai jo samarthak or sipaahi zyada hai
 That's why many of them have been fielded
 udhaaharan ke liye, pichley saal cabinet se hataae gaye monajir hossain or arjuna raay ko chunaav ladane kaa mauka unhone hi diya he
 It seems that Nitish believes that if a cabinet is not properly eligible to become a minister, he should be sent to the Lok Sabha
 yaa phir nitish kumaar aise log chaahate hai jo unke saath chalem-aise log nahin jo apni aawaaj buland karen or kal ko party netaa pad ke hi ummidavaar ban jaaen
 Not only this, Nitish Kumar is also trying his best to prove himself right
 apni chhavi ko saaf rakhane kii isi kavayad ke tahat hi to unhone apni gathbandhan sahyogi bhaajapa ke chunaav ghoshnaptr main shaamil ram mandir, uniform civil code or anuchhed 370 sareekhe masalon se khud ko alag rakhaa he
 Nitish was seen clarifying on this issue that the NDA would pursue its own common minimum program
 vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki agar chunaav ke baad ke samikarnon ke tahat rajnatik rup se punargathit hone kii jarurat aa padi to nitish apni gathbandhan sahyogi bhaajapa se bhi pallaa jhaadne main jaraa nahin jhijhakenge
 The Congress has already praised him on several occasions
 is baat ke bhi apratyaksh sanket die ja chuke hai ki bihar ke mukhyamantri kaa upie main swaagat he
 On the other hand, the Left parties have also received an open invitation to include Nitish Kumar in the Third Front
 abhi tak, nitish kumaar rajg ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke saath apana samarthan kaayam rakhe hue hai
 But in both cases — if JD (U) performs very well or does not yield the expected results — the possibilities remain
 sambhawatah nitish rashtriya raajnneeti main badi bhoomika nibhaane ke liye bhaajapa se daaman chhudaa bhi sakate hai
 It is no wonder that Nitish has been campaigning vigorously across Bihar, it is natural that due to the welfare of the minorities, the packages announced by his government in the last three and a half years, Lalu's Muslims Yadava is to break into the vote bank
 nitish aksar, bhavishya ke bare main sochate hai, yah usee samay spasht ho gaya tha jab unhone panchayat or sthaneey nikaayon main atyadhik pichhadaa varg ke liye aarakshan kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 But, a problem exists here
 rajg ummid kar rahaa he ki nitish kumaar ke alpsankhyak kalyaan package se-jisamen muslim bacchon ko muft pustakon kaa vitaran or scolership tathaa bhagalpur dangon ke shikaar logon kaa punarvaas shaamil he-bihar main alpsankhyak maton ko apni ore khinchne main madad mil sakegi
 But there is always a possibility that Muslims may not vote for the NDA
 jiskaa kaaran bhaajapa kaa saath he
 There is also a discussion that if after the elections it is analyzed that despite the secular image of Nitish Kumar, a large number of minorities have not voted for the NDA, then the Chief Minister of Bihar may also think of lightening the growing weight of the BJP
 Can
 isamen koi tajjub kii baat nahin ki lalu-paswan ne rajya main apni sthiti ko adhik majboot karne ke liye haath milaayaa he
 If seen from caste equations, it is in favor of RJD-LJP alliance but JD (U) -BJP alliance is in stronger position than 2004
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main upie gathbandhan ne bihar kii 40 main se 29 siton par jeet darj kii thi
 43 to the UPA alliance
 35 fisadi mat mili the (rajd-30
 67, LJP-8
 19 or congress 4
 49 per cent) while the NDA 36
 93 (jad(you)-22
 36 and BJP-14
 57) fisadi mat mili the
 But even the staunch supporters of RJD and LJP are not ready to accept that they will be able to repeat history
 lalu or paswan ko nitish ke samgr raajnneetik agenda se khatra he
 Therefore, both veterans tried to unite the OBC, Yadav, Muslim and Dalit votes
 iske alaava unki najar brahman voton par bhi he
 35 to JD (U) -BJP alliance in November 2005 assembly elections
 8 fisadi mat mili jabaki rajd or congress ko 29
 Only 2 percent votes could be got
 paswan kii lojpa, jo akele chunaav lard rahi thi, kii jheli main 10
 8 percent votes were cast
 yani upie ke teenon sahyogi rajg se adhik vot paane main safal rahe the
 The current Lok Sabha elections are apparently a litmus test for lalu-paswan
 sambhawatah ise inke kariyar ke sabase mushkil muqablon main se mana ja saktaa he
 But Nitish Kumar's attempt to attract Muslim votes is not the only problem that has made lalu-paswan sleepy, but also raised the Congress head in Bihar and fielded his candidates from Yadav and Muslims
 - Has posed a threat to Paswan's vote bank
 congress ne patliputra se lalu prasad ke khilaaf vijay singh yadav ko apana ummidavaar banaaya he
 He is leaving no stone unturned to make conditions difficult for Lalu Prasad
 lalu prasad ke saale or ab congressi sadhu yadav bhi vahaan apane jija ke khilaaf prachaar kar sakate hai
 The Congress has fielded many Yadav and Muslim candidates who can breach their Mai (muslim-yadav) vote bank
 jaahir baat he ki bihar main muslim matadaataaon kii sankhya kul matadaataaon kii 16 fisadi he
 In such a situation, it is also right for Lalu to be worried about him
 itane saalon tak, ve adwani ko nishaanaa banane or 1990 main unhen giraftaar karne ko bhunaate aae hai
 But Lalu's attack on the Congress on the Babri Masjid demolition case is a complete eye-opener, which has made his desperation palpable as Muslims in Bihar seem to have a choice other than RJD
 vahiin congress is baat ko samaj gai he ki kshetreey sahyogi usee ke vot bank par rotiyaan senkate aae hai, isliye vah ek baar phir rajya main apni majboot maujuudagi darj karana chaahati he
 The Congress last held power in Bihar on its own from 1989-90
 lekin congress kaa gussa us samay phuta jab lalu-paswan ne aapas main hi siton kaa bantwaaraa kar liya or congress ke liye sirf teen siten hi chodi
 After weighing all the options, the Congress decided to contest the 37 seats of the state on its own
 lekin ab dekhnaa yah he ki kya rajd ke baagiyon ke sahare congress rajya main apni sthiti majboot bana paaegi
 Some argue that going alone in the election field should be viewed from another point of view
 matlab yah ki isse 2004 ke vipareet chunaav ke baad vibhinn tarah ke vikalp khule rahete hai
 Though the Congress has a long way to go in Bihar, it has to revive its position in the state where it had won 48 seats in 1984 (54 undivided Bihar)
 us samay congress ko bihar main 51 fisadi vot mili the
 But in 2004, this oldest party of India got an opportunity to contest only four seats in the state and also 4% votes
 49 hi rah gaya
 It is clear that it is the Congress party whose leaders like Lalu, Paswan and Nitish set their support base by making a dent in the vote bank
 dekha jaae to maujuuda loksabhaa chunaav kaa mukhya mudda lalu-paswan ke liye apane varchasv or sammaan ko bachaana he to congress rajya main ek baar phir apana vyapak janaadhar taiyaar karnaa chaahati he
 On the other hand, Nitish Kumar wants to make his image bigger than these giants and wants to fly farther than what is seen
 yah to pakhwaade bhar ke bheetar hi pataa lag paaegaa ki kisko kitna mila or in loksabhaa chunaav main kisne kitna khoyaa
