 In the opinion of legal experts, model Poonam Pandeyka seeking permission from the BCCI to celebrate nakedly after the Indian cricket team won the World Cup is nothing more than misleading people
 saarvajanik sthal par kapade utarkar jashn manaanaa ashleelata kii shrenee main aata he jo aparaadh he or bisisiai yaa anya vyakti ko aparaadh ke liye anumati dene kii ijaajat nahin he
 Before the World Cup final, Poonam had said that she would undress and celebrate Team India's victory and she is still retaining this statement

 mahandiyaan ne bataaya, ‘kapade utarkar jashn manaanaa bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 294 (saarvajanik sthal par ashleel krity karnaa) ke tahat aparaadh kii shrenee main aa saktaa he or koi kisi duusare ko aparaadh karne kii anumati nahin de saktaa, chaahe vah bisisiai ho yaa koi or

 mahandiyaan ne kaha, ‘punam kaa iraadaa or bayaan donon logon ko ashleelata ke liye uksaa sakate hai jo bhartiya dand samhita ke tahat aparaadh he
 According to reports, though Poonam has once written a letter to the BCCI to fulfill her promise, but the Cricket Board rejected her demand
 vah ab bhi bisisiai se anumati kii intjaar kar rahi hai
 Jagdeep Dhankhar, a minister in the central government and advocate, says that allowing any crime does not come under the jurisdiction of the BCCI
 unhone kaha, ‘bisisiai yaa koi bhi aparaadh kii anumati nahin de saktaa kyonki koi bhi kanoon se badhkar nahin he
 If this happens, the police administration can take action by taking cognizance of it
 ’ dhankhad ne kaha, ‘aise bayaan dena yaa yah kaam karnaa saamaajik rup se to galat he or kisi ko bhi aise bayaan nahin dene chahie
 Another law expert Kamlesh Jain says that Poonam's statements fall under the category of provocative and any person can lodge a complaint against it
 kamalesh ne kaha, ‘bhadakau bayaan dene kii anumati kisi ko nahin he
 Any person can lodge a complaint with the police for this and in such a situation Poonam may have to bail because it is a bailable offense
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘is tarah ke bayanon ko halke main nahin liya ja saktaa kyonki yuva peedhee par iskaa sidhaa asar ho saktaa he
 They may think that this is the right way to gain popularity and work

 Is BJP scared of itself or 'AAP'? That means from the Aam Aadmi Party
 shaayad, ‘aap’ or apane aap donon se
 By myself, that is, party workers, especially senior leaders of Delhi BJP? Survey reports in recent times seem to have increased this fear of the BJP too much, only then the party was forced to change its strategy
 aakhir dar kis baat kaa?arvind kejariwal kii kaat ke taur parabijepi ne kiran bedi ko maidan main utaar to diya, lekin vah voter se thik se communicket nahin kar paa rahi hai
 While Kejriwal is able to explain everything, Kiran Bedi is unable to connect with people
 kejariwal jhuggi bastiyon or loar middle class ke bich apni paith badhaate ja rahe hai, lekin bijepi ke liye ab bhi ye tedi kheer bana hua he
 The infighting in the party over imposition of Kiran Bedi from above and ticket distribution is not ending
 dilli bijepi ke netaa prachaar main hajiri to laga rahe hai lekin kaam upree man se kar rahe hai
 If the BJP was having this fear, then there was no option but to change the strategy
 daro to dephence nahin, offence apnaokejariwal shuru se hi aakraamak raajnneeti main vishwaas rakhte hai
 In such a situation, Kejriwal or his team attacks the opponents every day on some or the other issue - and the BJP leaders used to just give defensive statements throughout the day
 ab kejariwal ke khilaaf bijepi atekking mod main he – or party kii ore se rojaanaa paanch sawaal daage ja rahe hai
 However, Kejriwal also specializes in counter attacks
 bijepi ke us chunavi vigyaapan par aam aadmi party ne use kathghare main khadaa kar diya he, jisamen anna ke photo ko maala pahanaai di gai he
 Now how fast BJP is able to keep the edge of its attack, it matters most
 ‘votakatwa’ kitna madadgaar?chunaavon main ‘votakatwa’ formula barason se practice main he jisamen virdohi kaa vot kaatane ke liye dami candidet khadey kiye jate hai
 BJP strategists feel that if the Congress draws people towards them, the AAP vote will be cut - it will directly benefit the BJP
 isiilie kejariwal ke prati atekking or congress ke prati soft rahane kii stritegi apanaai gai he
 How much BJP benefits from this depends on the intelligence of the command and effective implementation of their plans
 saport system kitna prabhavi?loksabhaa kii tarah dilli vidhansabha chunaav main bhi sangh saport system kaam main jute gaya he
 Volunteers have been asked to adopt a militant attitude like a kabaddi team in this election
 unase kaha gaya he ki jis tarah kabddi main target hit karne tak saans ko roke rakhte hai, usee tarah chunavi maidan main date rahanaa he
 The Sangh has 70 pracharaks posted for the 70 legislative assemblies of Delhi
 amit shah ne sangh ke bharosemand logon ko lekar jo team banaai he wo sidhe unheen ko report kar rahi he
 This support system is perhaps the strongest for the BJP
 dilli main ye system kya kamaal dikhaa paata he ye to nattejey hi bataaenge
 How powerful is the new strategy? BJP has a week to prove Kiran Bedi the best candidate for the post of Delhi Chief Minister
 is dauraan 250 reliyon kaa plan he
 That means about 35 rallies daily for 70 legislative assemblies of Delhi
 party ne chunaav main do tihaai siten jeetne kaa target rakhaa he
 Just as there are three army commanders in the war, similarly Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Minister Arun Jaitley and BJP President Amit Shah have taken over the front themselves
 bijepi kii chunauti philhal yahi he ki jaise bhi ho dar ke aage kii jeet ko hasil karo, lekin kya ye raah itani aasaan he? kya ‘paanch saal kejariwal’ ke jawaab main ‘kejariwal se paanch sawaal’ hi bijepi kaa brahmastra he jisamen vah chaahegi kii chunaav tak media or voter ko uljhaae rakho, aakhir ek haftaa bitne main vakt hi kitna lagata he? shaayad haa, or shaayad nahin bhi! Congress veteran Manish Tiwari has made a scathing attack on the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) through Twitter
 teen baar talaak ke mudde par board ke ravaiye ko lekar unhone sawaal kiya he ki kya muslim personal lau samvidhan se bhi upar hai
 Tiwari's question has come on aimplb's statement in which it said that its rules are based on the Quran and it does not come under the purview of the Supreme Court
 congress pravaktaa or peshey se vakil manish tiwari ne twit kar poocha, 'jo mohammaden lau teen baar talaak kii anumati detaa he, kya vah bhartiya samvidhan se bhi upar he? kya muslim mahilaon kiekatarafa talakamen suraksha sunishchit nahin kii jaani chahie?'can Mohammedan Law that allows Triple Talaq be above Indian constitution?are Muslim Women not entitled to protection from arbitrary divorces— Manish Tewari (@manishtewari)march 24, 2016manish tiwari ne kaha ki bhartiya samvidhan ke artical 25 or 26 main diya gaya dharm kii swantatrata kaa adhikaar tathyon ko chupa patansheel prathaon ke auchity ko sabit karne kaa jariya ban gaya he
 Tiwari, however, seemed to avoid saying anything after this
 yahi nahin, ol india congress kamity ke general secratory or media prabharee randeep surajevaala ne bhi is maamle main kuch kehane se inkaar kar diya

 uskaa tark he ki hindu civil cord 1956 main paas kiya gaya, lekin hinduon ke bich jatiyon ko lekar bhedbhaav khatm nahin hue
 The Muslim Personal Law Board said that the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has not only refused to accept the instructions of the highest court of the country, but has told it outside its jurisdiction
 supreme court ne swatah sangyaan lete hue muslim personal lau main teen baar talaak kahkar rishte khatm karne kii pratha kii kanoonee vaidhata jaanch karne kaa nirdesh diya tha
 Whereas AIMPLB has said that it is not under the jurisdiction of the court
 lau board kaa kahana he ki samudaay ke personal lau quran par aadhaarit hai, aise main yah sarvocch adaalat ke kshetradhikaar main nahin he ki vah uski samiksha kare
 AIMPLB said that it is not a law passed by Parliament
 board ne uniform civil code kii upyogita ko bhi chunauti dete hue kaha ki yah rashtriya akhandta or ekta kii koi guarantee nahin he
 They argue that a common faith failed to keep Christian countries separate from the two world wars
 empielbi ne kaha ki isi tarah hindu code bill jaateey bhedbhaav ko nahin mitaa sakaa
 What has been the Congress's attitude so far, the Congress is often silent about the Uniform Civil Code
 jabaki bijepi ke liye yah bada mudda rahaa he
 In 1986, Rajiv Gandhi's government stood firmly with the Muslim Personal Law
 supreme court ne shah bano talaak maamle main bharan-poshan ke liye muaavja muhaiyaa karaane kaa nirdesh diya tha, lekin rajeev gandhi ne sansad se kanoon paas kar supreme court ke faisle ko badal diya tha
 There is often a question mark regarding education and education in government schools
 yahi nahin sarkari skulon ke shikshakon kii yogyata or anushaasanheenata kii khabare aksar surkiyon main rahati he
 This has had a direct impact on the image of government schools
 bade afasar hon yaa vyapaaree or madhyam vargeey pariwaron se taalluk rakhane vaala ek bada varg, apane bacchon kaa daakhila sarkari skulon main karaane kii bajaay privet skool main karana munasib samajhataa he
 But now this pattern is about to break
 taaja maamla chhattisgarh ke balrampur jile kaa he
 The collector here has enrolled his child in a government school instead of a private school
 rajya main 15 june se sarkari skulon main padhai-likhaai shuru ho gai he
 Collector Avinash Kumar Sharan has got his five-year-old daughter enrolled in a government school
 unhone apni beti kii praathmik str kii padhai ke liye sarkari pragna praathmik vidhyalay ko chunaa he
 With this initiative, it seems that the fingers arising on the education of government schools will stop
 jaahir he ki jis skool main jile ke colector ke bachche padhenge, us skool kaa shiksha kaa str khud ba khud sudhar jayega
 When people came to know that the children of the Collector of the district were studying in the common government school, then suddenly no one believed it, but when the Collector's daughter's daughter came and went to the school to study, she was convinced
 chhattisgarh ke aalaa naukarshahon ke bacchenijee branded skulon mempadhai kar rahe hai
 Children of many officers are studying outside the state and abroad for primary education
 aise main ek iees afasar kii bacchee kaa sarkari skool main daakhila ullekhneey he
 However, people are hopeful that such initiatives and other officers will also do so
 kamovesh unke is kadam se sarkari skulon kii badahaali jarur dur hogi

 aaj yadi balasahab thakare jinda hote to bade khush hote
 In his mouthpiece Saamana, he would surely write that 'maharashtra's new honor, Sachin Tendulkar Bharat Ratna'
 He might not forget to add that Sachin is the first Maharashtra Ratna, it should never be forgotten
 or haa, sachin kii tarif karte samay balasahab yah bhi bhul gaye hote ki do saal pehle isi sachin ko 'mumbai sabaki' kehane par unhone jamkar latada tha
 Now it is a matter of sensation that just a day before the anniversary of Balasaheb's death, Sachin retired and a Bharat Ratna was also announced
 balasahab kaa vyaktitv kuch aisa hi tha
 If we protest, it is as if there is no bigger enemy than him and he praises as if there is no friend greater than him
 unki isi style kii maar sharad pavaar se lekar aam patrakaron tak ko bhi padi
 But this image of hers managed to connect all those people with her in Maharashtra
 balasahab kis maamle par kya kahenge or kya stand lenge, isaki bhavishyavaanee karnaa behad mushkil tha
 The Shiv soldiers were convinced of this Incredible image
 bal thakare endie main bijepi ke kareebi saathi the, atal bihari vaajapeyi se unki puraani dosti thi
 But making fun of Prime Minister Vajpayee in a full meeting was also very easy for him
 sanjay dutt ke khilaaf shivasainikon ne ugr andolan kiya, use asli 'khalanaayak' tak bataa diya
 Bal Thackeray said that if Sanjay Dutt is found guilty, then punish him, but till then do not hurt
 is thakreniti ko bhi koi samaj nahin paaya
 Even the people standing with him never objected to this
 maharashtra kii raajnneeti main sharad pavaar unke sabase bade dushman the
 When Pawar was talked about in rallies, Balasaheb's tongue always slipped, despite this there was no difference in his personal friendship
 or ye baat aam janata bhi achche se jaanati thi
 They were the same people who made Sharad Pawar a verbal victim, and if Pawar becomes Prime Minister, Shiv Sena will support him, saying those people were Balasaheb too
 patrkaar or unke daftaron par hamalaa karwaane vaale balasahab ye bhul jate the ki wo bhi ek sampadak hai
 Despite this, Balasaheb remained the one who gave the most news
 kathani or kerani main itnaa bada antar khuleam lekin lakhon ke dilon par raaj karne vaala doosraa koi netaa maine abtak nahin dekha
 Somebody was right that only a party like Shiv Sena can run Balasaheb
 kabhi marathivaad kabhi hindutv, kabhi congress ko samarthan to kabhi sharad pavaar kii vaahvahee
 Despite taking a new route at every turn and appearing in a new role, Balasaheb was able to keep a tight grip on the cadre
 balasahab thakare ne bheed kii nabj pahachaani
 His mood made him the most popular leader, but could never reach power on his own
 haalanki bina satta ke bhi apni baat manwaane kii takat unke paas thi or isi ke boote unke netritv main party ne 45 saal kaa rasta napa
 The wife died, elder son Bindumadhav died in a car accident, estrangement with another son Jaydev and rebellion of a loved nephew Raj Thackeray
 ye saare vyaktigat aghat sahakar bhi shivasena chif ke naate unka or aam shiv sainik kaa naata hameshaa atoot rahaa
 a year after the death of Bal Thackeray, if the Shiv Sena is missing the biggest problem, then the Shiv Sena's 'nuance value'
 vaise balasahab ke aakhri saalon main uddhav thakare hi saare faisle le rahe the, lekin balasahab ke paas vito kaa adhikaar rahata or wo kabhi-kabhaar uskaa istemaal bhi karte
 Now the entire occupant is on Uddhav Thackeray
 wo apni style se party chalaa rahe hai
 The party cadre has been shaken up in urban areas such as Mumbai, Pune or Nashik, but Marathwada in Maharashtra is still strong in the rural areas of Vidarbha and is associated with the party
 balasahab ke taiyaar kiye hue netaaon kii peedi ab party chhod chuki he yaa darkinar kar di gai he
 Manohar Joshi was the last in Balasaheb's generational party
 joshi adhikrut rup se ritair naa hote hue bhi ritair hai
 Uddhav is still searching for his land
 unhone apni peedi taiyaar kii he or ab party main kam se kam unhen chunaut dene vaala nahin he
 But still they face many challenges outside
 bhale hi wo apane pita jaisi raajnneeti nahin kar paye, lekin raajnneeti wo apane pita se hi siikhe hai
 father's charisma and ' usance value' are with him, he knows
 uddhav apni chhavi kii party taiyaar kar rahe hai, lekin iske baavjood party chalaane ke liye unhen pita kii chhavi shivasena ke saath jodakar rakhni hogi
 How they are able to play these conflicting roles will be very interesting
 unhone apane bete aditya ko bahut jald akhaade main laane kii koshish kii he

 apane bhakton ke dukhon or har sankat ko dur karne kaa daawa karne vaali radhe maa ab khud musiibat main funs gayi hai
 In fact, Mumbai Police has issued a summons to Radhe Maa and she can ask for Radhe Maa in the coming days 
 chunki radhe maa par dahej utpeedan ke liye uksaane ke saath-saagapane satsangon mechashleelata failaane ke aarope lage hai lekin abhi tak police ne mumbai ke do alag-alag ilaakon main radhe maa ke khilaaf shikaayat darj hone ke baavjood unke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kii thi
 a summons has been sent to question 6 more accused in the case
 darasal radhe maa par mumbai kii ek mahila ne ye aarope lagaaya he ki radhe maa ke kehane par uske sasuraal vaale uske gharavaalon se 25 lakh rupye kaa dahej maang rahe hai
 Not only this, a woman lawyer from Mumbai, Falguni Bahmabhatta has accused Radhe Maa that she indulges hypocrisy in the name of her satsang and spreads obscenity
 ravivaar subah jab radhe maa aurangabad se mumbai pahunchi to airport par hamaare samvaadadaata ne ek baar phir unase un par lage rahe ilzaamon ke baar main poocha to radhe ne kaha ki un par lage tamaam aarope galat hai or kudarat unka insaaf karegi
 And when he was asked that he was also accused of dowry harassment, Radhe Ma's answer was ready on this too
 iske baad police tafteesh ke sawaal par khud radhe maa ne to sidhaa kuch nahin kaha par unke ek bhakt ne kaha ki wo radhe maa par lage aaropon kii tafteesh main police kaa sahyog karenge
 Devotees of Radhe Maa say that whatever she says and whatever she does
 vaisaa koi or kar hi nahin saktaa, lekin ab unke isi kehane-karne ne unhen vivaadon main laa diya he, mushkilon main daal diya he
 After Mumbai, a person has filed a complaint against Radhe Maa for hurting people's feelings against him
 itnaa hi nahin gujarat ke kuccha main bhi radhe maa ke khilaaf 6 logon ne ek shikaayat darj karwaai he
 According to this complaint, these people had donated all their assets to Radhe Maa so that there would be some improvement in their situation but nothing like that happened
 ab jaise-jaise radhe maa ke khilaaf shikayaton kaa pulinda badhata ja rahaa he use dekh kar to lagata he ki aane vaale din radhe maa ke liye koi acchhee khabar lekar nahin aa rahe hai

 peeche ek binar laga hua he jisamen '370 hataao, aatankwaad mitaao, desh bachaao' likhaa hua dekha ja saktaa he
 Ram Madhav's tweet was shared by about 4000 people till the story was written

 However, the raindrops stopped for a few seconds and in the same time Chandrayaan went towards his goal
 vah kshan dekhnaa or darshakon ko dikhaanaa donon hi garv kaa tha
 After that, we were all taken off the roof and brought to a large auditorium, where scientists associated with the Chandrayaan project told us all
 us samay isro ke pramukh ji madhavan the
 Scientists of the country were talking to the country in front of hundreds of cameras
 uske baad ke kuch dinon tak vahi vaigyanik kai news channelon main jaakar apni kamyaabi ke bare main bataa rahe the
 The success of 2008 was not modest
 tab bhi bharat main ek pradhanmantri the jinka naam manmohan singh tha
 He congratulated and left it to the rest of the scientists to communicate with the country
 sainkadon camaron ke saamne isro ke vaigyanik the
 Manmohan Singh and no Prime Minister before him used isro's success in their election poster
 buudhvaar ko mishan shakti ke safal hote hi whats ap uniwarsity main missile kii photo ke saath narendra modi ke poster banakar chalane lage the
 Not only this, when India tested the A-SAT missile capability on 27 March, all the scientists were lost in front of the cameras
 sirf or sirf bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi saamne the
 Only one picture of this success has reached the public

 His colleagues continue to call this the success of the decision-making government

 There is a video footage of NDTV - 19 April 2012 in the archive
 us samay bharat ne lo-orbit main upgrah ko maarane vaali missile agni-vka safal pareekshan kiya tha
 In the video, the then director of DRDO is seen celebrating

 G
 Satish Reddy is sitting but he was missing from the media
 unki team gaayab thi
 In his place, Vijay Saraswat, who retired from DRDO and became a member of NITI Aayog, was giving knowledge about it in the media
 maujuuda chairman or vaigyanik desh ke saamne se gaayab rahe
 a retired chairman was imparting knowledge so that he could comment on the UPA government on the pretext that he did not allow mission power
 baad main inhen ke bayaan ke sahare arun jetali bijepi mukhyalay main congress par hamalaa kar rahe the
 The current chairman could not say this because the code of conduct is in force due to the election
 jabaki isi ve ke saraswat ne10farvari2010ko kaha tha ki bharat ke paas upgrah ko maar giraane vaali missile kshamta he lekin vah asli upgrah ko maar kar apni kshamta kaa pradarshan nahin karegaa
 India does not feel the need because it creates waste in space
 in kacharon se antariksh main upgrahon ke system ko nuqasaan pahunchataa he
 At the time, DRDO Chief accepted what VK Saraswat said
 aaj vahi niti ayog ke sadsy banakar saraswat upie sarkaar ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 You can search his statement in the internet
 niti ayog ke upaadhyaksh rajeev kumaar kii tarah ve ke saraswat ne bhi aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan kiya he
 This is obviously politics
 isro or raksha anusandhan kaa istamaal narendra modi apane raajnneetik hit ke liye kar rahe hai
 He was supposed to address the names of the nation and influence nothing but voters

 The reporters who were not able to properly report the shortcomings of the Ujjwala scheme became the experts of space science throughout the day on Wednesday
 unki reporting main vigyaan kam tha
 Modi was praised and the opposition ridiculed
 sitambar2014se isro desh ke naam par bhaajapa or narendra modi kii raajnneeti kaa centre ban gaya tha jab mangalayan ke samay pradhanmantri modi khud vaigyanikon ke bich maujuud the
 It was decided on the same day that India's scientific success would not be of scientists, but of Prime Minister Modi
 china ne bhi is kshamta kaa pareekshan kiya magar usne tivi par aakar duniya ko nahin bataaya
 This has been the tradition
 antariksh vigyaan kii kamyaabi vaigyanikon par chhod di jaati he
 But now these are all part of propaganda for Modi
 chunaav ayog narendra modi ke raashtra ke naam sambodhan kii jaanch kar rahaa he
 Mendiratta, who was the legal adviser to the commission, told 'the Print' that he never saw any prime minister doing this after the code of conduct came into force
 pradhanmantri ne sambodhan main aise bahut se shabdon kaa prayog kiya he jinka istamaal apane raajnneetik manchon par karte rahe hai
 This case is a test of the Election Commission
 mujhe andeh he ki ayog kuch karegaa
 He will find excuses
 kya ham ek sanstha ke rup main chunaav ayog kaa samaapan dekh rahe hai?samaapan kaa sidhaa prasaaran!he raashtra! utho,ab tum in sansthaaon ko sambodhit karo

 According to US top experts, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has clearly emerged as a favorite leader for the 2019 general elections after the bjp's resounding victories in the Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand assembly elections
 ek visheshgy ne kaha ki paanch rajyon main sampann hue vidhansabha chunaavon ke nattejey dikhaate hai ki varsh 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey koi asaamaanya nahin the
 Another expert said that it seems that Modi will continue to lead India even after 2019
 jorge washington uniwarsity main raajnneeti vigyaan evam antarrashtriya maamalon ke sahaayak professor adam jigafeld ne kaha ki vidhansabha chunaav zyada badlaav kaa sanket nahin dete
 The results of the Uttar Pradesh elections have shown that the 2014 general elections were not an 'unusual' thing
 tippaniyan He said, 'it was a big win for the BJP
 uskaa ummidavaar do pichley vijetaon-basapa or sapa kii tulana main kahin adhik antar se jeet gaya
 Sadanand Dhume, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute, said that these elections have established Modi as a 'clear and preferred winner' for the 2019 election
 unhone kaha, ‘modi varsh 2019 kii daud main sabase aage hai
 Professor Irfan Nooruddin of Georgetown University's Walsh School of Foreign Service said that in 2019, the BJP is less likely to get a straight majority and Modi will move towards forming a coalition government
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa kaa ek ke baad ek rajya main chunaav prachaar safal rahaa he jabaki vipaksh aisa karne main naakaam rahaa he
 Nooruddin said that in a state where the party has to face direct opposition, it does not perform well
 yadi vipaksh ek saath aa jaae to bhaajapa ko parrast kiya ja saktaa he
 He said that when the party has to face scattered opposition, it gets an advantage there
 varsh 2019 main sattavirohi lahar maujuud hogi
 Dhume, who was present in Uttar Pradesh during the election, said that in these elections, BJP described itself as above caste but played the caste card there
 rajya main logon ke saath hui baatcheet kaa hawala dete hue unhone kaha, ‘notebandi behad lokapriy he
 It won the hearts and minds of the Indian public, who were troubled by this policy
 yahaan ek sanjeeda vyakti he, jisane bhrasht or amir logon par ek saidhantik prahaar kiya he
 However, Dhume also said that after this historic victory in Uttar Pradesh, Modi will probably not move in the direction of economic reform as the private sector wants
 council on fahrren rilations main bharat, pakistan or dakshin asia ke maamalon kii varisht shodharthi alisa yrs ne kaha ki bharat apane un aarthik sudhaaron ko badhaane ja rahaa he, jo desh kii janata ko sidhe taur par prabhavit karte hai
 The BJP will now gain a lot of seats in the Rajya Sabha, which will help it execute pending reforms like the Land Acquisition Act and Labor Reforms
 vah varsh 2018 main siten hasil karnaa shuru kar denge
 The BJP is looking ahead to the year 2019 and beyond
 unhone kaha, ‘yah bhaajapa ke liye ek badi jeet thi
 Its candidate won by far more than the two previous winners - BSP and SP
 ’american enterproij institute ke shodharthi sadanand dhume ne kaha ki in chunaavon ne modi ko varsh 2019 ke chunaav ke liye ek ‘spasht or pasandida vijeta’ ke taur par sthapit kar diya he
 He said, 'modi is at the forefront of the 2019 race
 ’ georgetaun uniwarsity ke walsh skool of fahrren sarvice ke professor irfan nuruddin ne kaha ki varsh 2019 main bhaajapa ko sidhaa bahumat milane kii sambhaavna kam he or modi gathbandhan kii sarkaar banane kii disha main badhenge
 He said that bjp's election campaign in successive states has been successful, while the opposition has failed to do so
 nuruddin ne kaha ki jis rajya main party ko sidhe vipaksh kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, vahaan yah acha pradarshan nahin karti
 If the opposition comes together, the BJP can be defeated
 unhone kaha ki party ko jab bikhare hue vipaksh kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, vahaan use laabh miltaa he
 In the year 2019, anti-incumbency wave will be present
 chunaav ke dauraan uttarapradesh main maujuud rahe dhume ne kaha ki in chunaavon main bhaajapa ne khud ko jati se upar bataaya lekin vahaan jati card khelaa
 Quoting conversations with people in the state, he said, 'demonetisation is extremely popular
 isane us bhartiya janata kaa dil or dimag jeet liya, jo is niti ke chalate pareshaan hui
 There is a serious person here, who has made a principled attack on the corrupt and rich people
 ’ haalanki dhume ne yah bhi kaha ki uttarapradesh main is aitihaasik jeet ke baad modi sambhavat: aise aarthik sudhaar kii disha main nahin badhenge, jaisaa nijee kshetra chahta he
 In the Council on Foreign Relations, senior researcher for the affairs of India, Pakistan and South Asia, Alyssa Aires said that India is going to step up its economic reforms which directly affect the people of the country
 bhaajapa ab rajyasabha main bahut si siten hasil karegi, jo use bhoomi adhigrahan adhinium or shram sudhaar jaise lambit sudhaaron ko anjaam dene main madad karengi
 He will start gaining seats in the year 2018

 salmaan khan ke phens ko 'devil' kaa andaaj khub pasand aa rahaa he
 Yes, then the trailer of the film Kick has been seen on youtube for 12 million and 675 times in just 220 hours of its release
 yani 15 june ko trailor relies ke baad har ghante ise utyub par 45 hajaar se adhik baar dekha gaya
 Apparently the film's trailer on youtube has proved to be a super-duper hit, not just a hit
 aise main film sameekshak se lekar bazaar vishleshak tak sabhi yahi anumaan laga rahe hai ki 'kik' box offis par aitihaasik record kaayam karegi
 This is also possible because the film is being released on the occasion of Eid, which is considered to be the lucky charm of Salman
 bataa den ki salmaan khan ne 15 june ko din ke kareeb 3:30 baje film kaa trailor relies kiya tha
 Salman chose a single-screen theater from Mumbai for the trailer release
 haalanki trailor relies karne ke thik baad salmaan ne iske utyub link ko apane fasebuk pej par share kiya tha
 On the Facebook page, the trailer of the film has been liked by more than 90 thousand people, while about 7 thousand people have shared the link
 'jume kii raat' bhi hitalagata he salmaan ke diwaanon ko 'kik' kaa besabri se intjaar he
 That is why the first song of the film 'jume Ki Raat' has also got a tremendous opening on youtube
 is song ko mahaj 4 din main 29 lakh se adhik baar dekha ja chukaa he
 This song has also been compared to the famous song 'juma Chumma' filmed on Amitabh Bachchan
 song main salmaan kii jabardast entry dikhaai gai he, jabaki laal short dress main jacleen kaa andaaj man moh lene vaala he
 Jumme ki Raat Vs Jumma chuma'i come to heart, don't understand'it is clear with the trailer release that Salman is in the gray shade in the film
 yani unka andaaj hero ke saath hi kuch-kuch villen jaisaa bhi he
 Salman's name in the film is' Devil 'and he says,' Don't think too much about me
 dil main aata hum, samaj main nahin'
 Apart from Salman Khan, Jacqueline Fernandes is also seen in the film trailer along with Randeep Hooda, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Sanjay Mishra and Saurabh Shukla
 trailor main ection seen kii bharmaar he
 In this, Salman's French cut bear is also getting much appreciation
 dekhen film kaa trailor:dekhen song 'jume kii raat' Even after a long career in Bollywood, Ajay Devgan has generally avoided onscreen kissing scenes
 27 saal lambey kariyar main kam hi aise maukey aae jab akshay ne onscreen romantic kising seen main dilchaspee dikhaai ho
 In an interview with DNA, Ajay Devgan said that his films are often family films and he does not want to make family audiences unconfirmed by using kissing in his films
 unhone kaha ki 'main zyaadaatar unheen filmon kii scripts chunata hum jo family audiyans ke liye hoti he
 This is the reason why most of my films do not have a special demand for onscreen kissing and anyway, if i have come to see a film in a family theater, then it becomes my responsibility to provide healthy entertainment to me and our team

 Sri Lanka The Sri Lankan team, which has been going through a bad phase for some time, has prepared a green pitch in this formality match
 haalanki kharaab mausam ke kaaran bhartiya team abhyaas nahin kar saki
 Sri Lanka have included pacemen Dushmanta Chameera and Lahiru Gamge in the squad who will replace injured Nuwan Pradeep and Rangana Herath
 srilanka ne pehle do test maichon main sirf ek pari main 300 kaa aankada paar kiya he
 In the last Test match, Sri Lanka saved some glory due to centuries by Dimuth Karunaratne and Kushal Mendis

 Finally the seventh World Happiness Report 2019 arrived
 bharat 2018 kii sthiti main 133 se girakar 140 wein sthaan par aa gaya he
 Finland is ranked first
 jab bharat har kshetra main aage bad rahaa he to yah jaananaa bhi jaruri ho jaataa he ki ham khush kyon nahin he?prasannataa ko maapne kii avadharana bhutan se hi shuru hui thi
 On Bhutan's proposal, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network released the first World Happiness Report for the United Nations in 2012 and declared March 20 as World Happiness Day
 pehali report main bharat kaa sthaan 111waan tha or denmark pehle sthaan par tha
 Every year, as soon as the World Happiness Report arrives, many serious questions related to happiness emerge and are lost again in search of answers
 pehali vishwa prasannataa report se lekar ab tak kuch desh aise hai jo pehle das sthanon par bane hue hai jaise denmark, finland, norge, sweden, switzaraland, canada, austria, iceland, australia,or newzealand
 Their ranking varies only slightly
 vidambnaa he ki asia kaa koi desh pehle das main shaamil nahin rahaa
 The situation in countries of South Asia in particular is very worrying
 jaahir he ye desh shanti or maanav vikaas donon kshetron main pichde hai
 An interesting picture emerges from the comparative study of happiness indices and the economy indices
 saath hi gambhir sawaal bhi khadaa hota he ki kya teji se badhati arthvyavastha kaa sidhaa prabhaav prasannataa ke suchakanko par bhi padataa he? bharat kii sthiti kaa akalan is antarsambandh ko samajhane main madadgaar hoga
 Many weak and small economical countries are ahead of India many times in a state of happiness
 bharat kii arthvyavastha ke bare main daawey kiye ja rahe hai ki jaldi hi yah china ke mukaable khadi ho jaaegi
 Then will we become the happiest country? it's hard to say
 rashtriya prasannataa suchakank kii avadharana dene vaala bhutan bhi peeche he
 India is lagging behind in calculating happiness
 yah spasht ho jaataa he ki bhugolic vishalata, saamaajik or aarthik asamanta, shashan-prashasan kii sheliyaan, jansankhya kaa saamaajik or shaikshanik str, dharmik or aadhyatmik vyavhaar kuch aise kaaran he jinhen prasannataa maapne main andekha kar diya gaya he
 Should the calculation of happiness indices be included in the calculation of GDP? Experts differ on this matter
 sabase bada tark yah he ki prasannataa ek man:sthiti he
 It has different meanings for each person and country and may have different reasons
 udhaaharan ke liye, jin baton se bharat ke log khush hote hai vah sthiti duniya ke anya deshon main nahin he
 Bhutan, the country producing the indicators of happiness, is very low in calculating the indicators of happiness
 bhutan buddha dharmavalambee desh he
 Buddha's teachings have a strong influence on the conditions of happiness in Bhutan
 buddha ne chaar arya satya bataae hai
 Sadness is the cause of suffering
 dukh kaa nivaaran he
 a path of redress is available
 buddha kii shikshaaon ko aatmsaat karte hue aam bhutani naagarik prasann rahane kaa kaushal swaabhaavik rup se samajhataa he
 The teachings of Jesus are accepted in countries whose rankings are in the first 10 countries
 is drushti se bharat ke nagarikon kii darshanik drushti ucch koti kii hona chahie
 After all, why the common citizens of India are not happy despite developing in every field? India needs to develop its index of happiness
 prasannataa ke vaishvik suchakank main bhartiya samaaj kii banaavat or isamen rachi-basii vibhinn dharao ko gina nahin ja saktaa
 The structure of Indian society is such that every citizen can be happy here
 paramparaayen, reeti rivaaj, utsav, kala–samskruti, teej-tyohaar, khan-paan or vividhtaon se bharaa samaaj khushiyon ke hajaar maukey detaa he
 The whole society is happy on festivals like Holi and Deepawali
 bharat main mithaiyon kii jitani dukaane hai utani duniya ke shaayad hi kisi desh main he
 Sweet and Khushi's choli is with Damon
 prasannataa kii sthiti kaa akalan ke jin sthitiyon par kiya jaataa hai ve sab vikaas prakriyaaon se judi hai
 Interestingly, the US with the largest economy is ranked 19th in the latest report, a notch below last year
 saamanytah prati vyakti aay, jidipi, swasthya jisamen ausat aayu shaamil he, saamaajik sahyog, aapasi vishwaas, jivan sambandhi nirnay lene kii swatantraaa or udaartaa jaise sanketakon par khushiyon kii adhyayan report taiyaar kii jaati he
 Conditions change globally every year
 udhaaharan ke liye, 2017 kii report main rojgaar kii sthiti or prasannataa ke paraspar sambandhon par adhyayan tha
 Until every citizen has dignified employment, he cannot be happy
 bharat main berogari kii bhayavahata chuphi nahin he
 Continuation of corruption is also fatal to happiness
 bharat kii yah sabase badi samasya he
 Finland was ranked first in the World Happiness Report-2018
 uske baad norge, denmark, iceland, switzraland, netherlands, canada, newjiland, sweden tathaa australia the
 The US was 18th, India 133rd and Bhutan 97th
 jahaan tak samaaj ke taane-bane, aadhyatmik swabhaav or shanti or aapasi bhaichaare jaise mulyon ke prati samvedansheeltaa kaa sawaal he to bharat ko apni ranking se dukhi hone kii zarurat nahin he

 The evidence found in the excavation of the Archeology Department was placed before the court
 ramalala virajman kii taraf se court main saboot pesh kiye gaye ki masjid se pehle us jagah par mandir kaa astitv tha
 Ram Lalla's lawyer CS Vaidyanathan said that from the Muslim side it was initially said that there is nothing under the ground, but later they said that the structure found inside the land is Islamic structure
 vakil vaidyanathan ne kaha, puraatatv vibhaag kii report ke mutabik jameen ke neeche se mandir ke strecchar mili hai
 The Allahabad High Court has also relied on the report of the Department of Archeology in its decision
 ramalala kii taraf se udhaaharan dete hue kaha gaya ki aaj ke daur main log flite lekar subah sabarimala ke darshan ke liye jate he or shaam ko laut aate he, lekin ram janmabhumi ko lekar shraddhalu kai sadiyon se darshan ke liye jate he, jabaki us samay nadi ke upar koi brij bhi nahin tha
 He further stated that from 1114 AD to 1155 AD, the 12th century king of Saket Mandla was Govinda Chandra
 us vakt ayodhya uski rajdhani thi
 There was a very big temple of Vishnu Hari here

 Vaidyanathan said after the mosque fell a stone slab was found, including an inscription written in the 12th or 13th century
 shilaalekh thodaa kshatigrast he or antim do panktiyaan baari kshatigrast ho gai hai
 The original text of the inscription is in Sanskrit
 iske transleshan par kisi ne aapatti nahin kii he, sirf isaki jagah ko lekar aapatti he
 The inscription mentions a temple built in Saket Mandal and is the birthplace of Rama
 12veen shatabdi main saket mandla kaa raja govinda chandra tha, us vakt ayodhya uski rajdhani thi
 There was a very big temple of Vishnu Hari here
 ye slab panchajnya ke ek reporter ne dekha tha
 On the Ayodhya Ram temple, Justice Chandrachud asked if this inscription has also been challenged? To which Vaidyanathan replied that the translation of the content written on the slab or the authenticity of this inscription has not been challenged, but the question has been raised as to whether the slab was found from the disputed land

 ramlila maidan se sonia gandhi ke siyaasi tir'modi-amit shah ke khilaaf virodh kaa elaan karen''kahaan he kaala dhan, jiske liye notebandi kii gai'ramlila maidan main bharat bachaao raily main congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne desh kii aarthik nitiyon ko lekar narendra modi sarkaar par joardaar hamalaa kiya
 Sonia Gandhi lashed out at the pair of Modi and Amit Shah and said that where is the black money for which demonetization is done? sonia ne kaha ki modi sarkaar kaa khajaana khaali kyon ho gaya he
 This should be investigated
 sarkaar ke khilaaf ek manch par teen gandhishanivaar kaa congress netritv ke teenon sheersh gandhi sonia, rahul or priyanka modi sarkaar par behad aakraamak najar aae
 Priyanka Gandhi raised issues like Unnao, farmer, employment
 rahul gandhi ne bijepi kii ore se kii ja rahi maafee kii maang par do took kaha ki unka naam rahul saavarkar gandhi nahin he or ve maafee nahin maangane vaale hai
 After Priyanka and Rahul, Congress President Sonia Gandhi came on stage and showered accusations and political attacks on Modi government
 kahaan he kaala dhan?congress adhyakshasonia gandhi kaha kikaledhanke liye jo notebandi kii gai thi wo dhan kiske paas he?
 Sonia Gandhi said, "today in Andher Nagri Chaupat Raja is like, the whole country is asking for everyone's support
 
 
 sabakaa vikaas kahaan he
 
 
 Why is the economy going down, where has employment gone
 kya is baat kii jaanch honi chahie ki nahin ki jis kaledhan ke liye notebandi lagu kiya gaya tha wo kalaadhan baahar kyon nahin aayaa, wo paisa kahaan chalaa gaya he, ye kaala dhan kiske paas he?"rbi kaa khajaana khaali kyon?sonia gandhi ne kaha ki narendra modi sarkaar ne bade dhooma-dhadaake ke saath aadhi raat ko GST lagu kii
 Why did the Modi government's treasury become empty after this? Why millions of crores of rupees were taken from RBI? Why are Navratna companies being sold? All these should be investigated
 sonia gandhi ne kaha ki aajkal desh kaa maahaul aisa ho gaya he ki jab marji dharaaen laga di jaati hai or hataa di jaati hai
 Sonia said that these people claim to be constitutional divas, but they take away the Constitution every day
 is dauraan congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne kaha ki ham sab isliye yahaan aae hai kyonki kaaphi samay se desh kii haalat behad kharaab ho gai he
 It is our responsibility to get out of our homes and agitate against it
 unhone kaha ki ninsaphi sahanaa kisi bhi haalat main thik nahin he
 An ambulance for the patient stood at AIIMS for over an hour, but to no avail
 yahaan se niraash hokar ambulance paas ke hi safarjang hospital ke liye nikal padi
 When we talked to the relative, it came to know that there is no bed here, so we have to go to another hospital
 marij ke rishtedaaron ko ye bhi pataa nahin ki safadarajang main ilaaj ho hi jayega or bed mil hi jayega
 Ambulances just wander in hope of a cure
 ambulance se aae marizo ko bhartee nahin karne kii samasya sirf ek jagah kii baat nahin he
 After AIIMS, now we reached GB Pant Hospital in Delhi itself
 zyada der intazaar nahin karnaa padaa, jab immergency ke baahar ek ambulance dikhi jo greater noida se ek dil ke mariz ko lekar ai thi
 The family kept trying to get into the emergency, but the ambulance had to go to the OPD from here
 paas hi alengepi aspataal he
 By the time we reached there, an ambulance from Greater Noida also came here after beating the OPD with the patient
 yahaan bhi rishtedaar se baat kii to pataa chalaa ki dil kaa daura padaa he, lekin kisi ko koi phikr nahin
 The patient lived or died
 kareeb 70 se 80 kilometre kaa safar tay karne ke baad jibi pant pahunchnaa hua or yahaan kareeb 3 ghante sirf immergency se opidi or phir alengepi ke chakkar main barbaad ho gaye
 Seeing the family in trouble, what is the harm in trying to help? lihaaja inke saath immergency ward kii taraf chal pade jahaan kaa maahaul aspataal se zyada kisi police thane kaa laga
 Finally got treatment but before that the precious two and a half hours were not spent on the way, but wasted wandering from hospital to hospital
 sawaal tha kya jibi pant main ambulance se aae har mariz ke saath aisa hi hota he
 Once again we reached GB Pant
 is baar baahar khadi ambulance babu jagjivan ram aspataal se refer hue ek mariz ko lekar ai thi, saath main junior resident doctor bhi tha
 Following the doctor, we also walked towards the ward
 yahaan maujuud doctoron se unki baatcheet hui lekin bhartee karaane main naakaam rahe
 It was found out that Dr
 Saheb was also asked to take the patient to OPD
 dilli police ne haal main bhi is baat ko lekar circular jari kiya he ki ambulance yaa immergency services ke raste main aane par 2000 rupye kaa jurmaana bharna hoga
 After which the ambulance with the patients may reach the hospital on time
 par sawaal he ki sadakon par jindagi ke liye ek ek second keemtee hone vaala vakt aspataal pahunchate hi phaltu kyon ho jaataa he
 In this era of cyber system and mobile GPS, can the government not arrange such a centralized number so that the ambulance carrying the patient does not have to travel from hospital to hospital and decide in advance where to reach it
 aise main vakt to bachegaa hi, saath hi wo jindagi bhi bachegi jisaki bharpai naa to kisi muaavje se ho sakati he naa hi kisi doshi par karrwai se

 No matter how many areas of India are known at this time, how the sky gets a little warm or the clouds turn a little mouth thirsty
 is sookhe or pyaas ke bich se andhvishwaas kii aisi tasviren baahar aaengi, ye dekh kar bhi yakeen nahin hota
 a tradition like this too
 
 
 upike bundelkhand main manyataon or parpanraon ke naam par apane jism ko nukile sariyon se chhidava kar devi maa ko khush karne kii ravaayat har saal navaratri kii navami par nibhaai jaati he
 a fair is organized every year on the Navami of Chaitra Navratri
 paidal tay karte hai mandir kaa safarmele main jahaan dur-daraaj se hajaaron mahilaayein apane sir par jowar kii baaliyaan liye pahunchati hai, vahiin mard apane jism par sang dhaaran kar devi maa ko khush karne kaa jatan karte hai
 In this, the devotees complete the journey of the temple by holding the song on foot by spraying parts of their body with the weapon that resembles the trident
 khatarnaak he aise chalanasang behad baari or nukila hota he, ise jism main laga kar paidal chalanaa apane-aap main behad khatarnaak he kyonki sang main duusare chor par hui maamuli si harakat bhi ghaav bada kar sakati he or shraddhalu ko buree tarah jakhmi kar sakati he
 It is a miracle! According to the local people, it is the miracle of the Mother Goddess that the blood sprinkles away from the sprinkling of the song here, after removing it, the scar of the wound does not escape and many times the same devotee has one or two in his body But it takes up to five or five songs
 
 
 
 So there will be no rain, due to which dryness has accelerated the practice of spraying the song, that in itself is a big windbnb because people here feel that if they did not follow it, it would not rain in return

 ham hameshaa aadesh jari karte hai
 How would someone survive in such an environment? hamen is mudde par lambey vakt tak chalane vaale upaay apnaane honge

 If there is any further violation, we will clamp down on the administration from bottom to top

 Sadly in this country, people are only interested in gimmick
 aisa har saal ho rahaa he
 The court said that the state governments are responsible for this
 logon ko is tarah marane ke liye nahin choda ja saktaa
 This is surprising
 aap logon ne sab chizon kaa majaak bana diya
 Burning of stubble has to be stopped

 When Ranbir Kapoor goes to see the drama at the Kapoor family-owned Prithvi Theater, he buys tickets and looks like a common man, when Parineeti Chopra starts driving around in her car in the city, next to the driver on the front seat She sits
 jab vidya baalan ko apekshaakrit choti venity vine di jaati he to set par maujuud log jaanate hai ki ve koi hangaamaa nahin karne vaaleen or man lagaakar shooting puri karengi
 At the same time, even after waiting for five hours during the shooting, Deepika's seductive smile does not fade
 yah nai paudh aatmavishvaas se labarej he or dusron ko izzat dena jaanati he
 They are ready to learn from their seniors: Parineeti follows the path of her friend Deepika and sister Priyanka; Shraddha Kapoor followed in the footsteps of Alia Rani Mukherjee, her aunt Padmini Kolhapuri
 ve sab set par samay se pahunchate hai, niyam se gym jate hai or shots achche se puraa karte hai
 They are completely devoted to their careers, love and each other
 lekin kaam se fursat milte hi ve bade belos andaaj main bina mechap baahar nikal jate hai or kisi bhi mudde par yaa role or saathi kalakaaron ke bare main puche gaye sawaalon kaa napa-tula jawaab dete hai
 (vidya Balan at Mumbai Airport with husband Siddharth Roy Kapur) Disciplined attitude, trust and punctuality are the mantra of today, as the crazy world of Indian cinema is creating a new era where business is flourishing
 yahaan tak ki chote shahar se ai kangana ranot ne bhi jindagi main mili kadave prem sambandhon kii ulajhanon se nikal maamuli sitare kaa chola phenk abhinay kaa loha manavaa hi liya
 Today, the ability to mold yourself in a character is tied to your head and not a brilliant personality
 aaj abhinay kii duniya karishmai yaa bhadkile vyaktitv kii mohataaj nahin
 It was the age of stars
 ve kuch alag hi din the jab bollywood main vilasitapurna jindagi jeene vaale diggaj maujuud the
 Shammi Kapoor, an enthusiastic and hot-blooded alcoholic, who would tear those pages from books once he read them
 madhu jain kii kitaab da kapoorsah da fasrt family of indian cinema main likhe tathyon ke mutabik ve “mardaana andaaj” ke kaayal the
 They would drive Buick convertibles and change cars as fast as their girlfriends
 ve shikaar, bandook or sangeet ke diwane the
 He would call himself a mail starlet
 filmmekar mahesh bhatta kehete hai, “jab aap beete dinon ke vilasitapurna jindagi jeene vaale abhinaytaon ke bare main sochate hai to aapako rajesh khanna or shammi kapur yaad aate hai
 "rajesh Khanna's house was adorned with precious curtains of silk
 apane bedroom kii deevaaron par unhone apni hi adamkad tasviren sajaa rakhi thim
 Today these things seem strange because show business is now a planned business
 rajesh khanna ko apane khun se chitthee likhane vaali, unki deewangi main jindagi bhar kunari rah jane vaali, anand (1997) main unke marane par foot-footkar rone vaali or dimple se shaadi karne par use (dimple) ji bhar kar kosne vaali ladkiyaan rajesh khanna ke super staradam kii dein thim
 Devyani Chabal, who was fond of watching the film, once said
 khanna “apni hi chhavi ke shikaar hai
 "but today's stars are just the opposite
 diarector anuraag kashyap kehete hai, “is peedi ne bhavy or bhadkeeli jindagi kii kahaniyaan suni hai or ve khud ko usase pare rakhana chaahate hai
 They know that the film does not run with just good acting and that a small piece of time is closed in their shoot
 ve zyada tej, zyada profeshnal or zyada vyaavhaarik hai
 There is no addiction to stardom on his head
 ” kashyap kehete hai ki ek aisa samay tha jab log samajhate the ki rajesh khanna apane saare gane khud hi gaate hai
 He has just completed a busy shoot with Ranbir Kapoor, whose humility, punctuality and tremendous ability to adapt to the situation matters more than the guarantee that the film he will be working on will be a hit
 kanvarseshan vid wahidaa rahamaan kii lekhika nasrin munni kabir maanati hai ki sitaron kii abha ko feekaa karne ke peeche media kaa atikaraman he
 She says, "earlier the life of the stars was covered with mystery
 lekin aaj media or soshal media, un par najar gadaaye rahata he or unke ek-ek pal kii khabaren parosata rahata he
 "the life of today's stars is an open book, whereas the stars of yesteryear lived in your imagination
 duusari vajah he unka dher saare vigyapanon or brands kaa hissaa bananaa
 “today, the stars are seen selling everything on TV and giving them their names
 pehle ke kalakaar shaayad hi kabhi kisi vigyaapan kaa hissaa banate the, lihaaja log unhen parde ke kirdaaron se hi pahachaanate the
 No wonder, as soon as Salman kept a publicist for himself and started appearing on TV, the crowd who jammed around his Bandra house started to come out
 (mumbai main street food kaa lutf lete aditya kapur or pariniti chopra)pehle sitaron ke bare main zyada jaankaree nahin milti thi, isliye unki shakhsiyat abujh paheli bani rahati or suni-sunai baton or afvaahon se paravaan chadhati jinhen patrikaayen masaaledaar banaakar parosatin
 People used to be crazy about characters
 isliye amitabh vijay ke naam se mashhoor ho gaye
 He used similar names in his other films; Khanna became immortalized in the name of Babu Moshay in Anand, then Raju became synonymous with Devanand in Guide (1965)
 raaj kapur ne aawaara (1951) or shri 420 (1955) ke khanaabadosh kirdaar ko apane andar basaa liya
 Today actors are adapting themselves in multi-faceted roles, they are ready and capable to play all kinds of roles
 unka khulaapan unke liye shaap he or vardaan bhi
 The nature of fans is also changing
 aaj ek prashansak zyada se zyada apane manapsand abhinayta kaa autograph lene yaa unka poster apane kamare main lagane yaa tatu banavaane kii khwaahish rakhata he
 Moving towards success, Alia's father Mahesh Bhatt says that among her fans are children of four to six years who come to visit her
 lekin ve is se sahamat hai ki prashansakon main badlaav aayaa he
 He says, "today the virtual space is quenching the thirst of fans
 ab kuch rahasy nahin rahaa
 But the reach of artists has also grown
 ” aaj unako bhagwaan bana dena brudabi kehalaayegaa
 Aaliya's charisma to move towards success will depend on how she takes these things, as well as her performance in films
 balaji films ke siio tanuj garg maanate hai ki aaj star kaa tamgaa milanaa aasaan he
 "the stars are today able to enhance their personality, they know how to handle the media, they are following the advice and their image is being presented in a special way and more easily marketed for them than 30 years ago
 Is being prepared nae chehron kaa teji se ubharna industry ke liye acha he
 Everyone realizes this boom, more and more people are becoming professional, so we need more people
 isse sabhi logon ke pair jameen par tike rahete hai kyonki unhen maaloom he ki kal na jane kiske sitare buland ho jaaen or vah star ban jaae
 "today's best star is Ranveer Singh
 ve chamkile, bemail kapade pahante hai, arjuna kapur ke saath dostana dikhaate hai or durex condom kaa prachaar karte hai
 But the image that the stars are making more or less today is considered to be the test of understanding and discipline of the values of this studio-production era
 unamem se kai film ke achche pradarshan par munaafe kaa kuch fisadi hasil karte hai
 Wazir Singh, editor of Box Office India, states that Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's entire advertising portfolio features a woman dedicated to the family: watches, jewelery, real estate, cooking and maternity products
 haalanki, unhone apane chaaron ore ek surakshit gheraa bana rakhaa he or isliye unka jaadu ab bhi barkaraar he
 Will Starr start to promote on the release of his film? The production house is not worried because they know that they will come
 lekin isse agali subah kii chatkh surkhiyon kii fehrist main yah baat shaamil nahin ho sakegi
 Today the stars are earning money, but that magnetic attraction is being lost somewhere

 The photo of a woman covered in a veil printed in the Haryana Samvad's monthly magazine Haryana Samvad has become a problem for the government
 darasal haryana samvaad ke letest adishan ke mukhyapej par ek ghunghat main khadi mahila kaa photo laga he or bagal main slogan likhaa he "ghunghat kii aan baan-hamaare haryana kii pahchaan"
 Manohar Lal government of Haryana is facing all-round attacks with this photo
 sarkaar ko ghunghat par garvaharyana sarkaar ke mantri abhi bhi is baat par kaayam hai ki ghunghat haryana kii parampara he or unhen apni parampara par garv he
 Haryana Education Minister Ram Vilas Sharma said that the daughters of Haryana are waving their glory all over the world but this does not mean that the people of Haryana have forgotten their tradition
 ghunghat haryana kii parampara kaa hissaa he or puure haryana or haryana kii sarkaar ko ghunghat kii parampara par garv he
 Khattar Sarkar on the backfoot The Haryana government is on the backfoot for stating the veil on the cover page of Haryana Dialogue, the official magazine of the Haryana government
 haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter se jab is magazine main ek roodhiwaadee parampara ko haryana kii shaan bataane ko lekar safai maangi gai to unhone is maamle kii jaankaree hone se inkaar kar diya or kaha ki wo jald hi is bare main jaankaree jutaayenge or is magazine ko dekhenge
 Slogan The women and organizations working for the rights of women and for the protection of women, have slammed the slogan "pride of Veil Haryana", slamming the government
 mahilaon or ladakiyon kaa kahana he ki ek taraf to sarkaar "beti bachaao beti padhaao" kaa naaraa de rahi he vahiin duusari ore nari ko ghunghat main rakhana chaah rahi he
 Bibipur village in Jind, Haryana is known for campaigns like "beti Bachao Beti Padhao" and "selfie with Doctor"
 vahaan kii mahilaon kaa kahana he ki agar unhen kalpana chawla or sania mirza bananaa he to ve kaise ghunghat kii aad main rahengi
 Jind's women power also says that the Khattar government should immediately withdraw this slogan
 ghunghat pratha ko apane gaanv main or aasapaas ke ganvo main khatm karwaane ke liye sabala kaarykram chalaane vaale jind ke bibipur gaanv ke purv sarpanch sunil jagalan kaa kahana he kii jis vibhaag ke adhikariyon ne ye slogan diya he unke khilaaf karrwai honi chahie
 According to Sunil, on the one hand, Haryana's daughters Femina are waving their glory in Miss India and WWE, on the other hand such slogans are painful
 naariyon ko ghunghat main rakhane ke sarkari magazine ke slogan ko lekar congress ne bhi haryana sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa he
 The Congress says that on the one hand the government is indulging in looting accolades by claiming to run a campaign like "beti Bachao Beti Padhao" and on the other hand it is giving an example of its narrow mindset by stating that the women are hiding in the veil
 
 congress kaa kahana he ki sarkaar kii kathani or kerani main kitna fark he or naariyon or unki haalat sudhaarney ko lekar sarkaar kii kya soch he wo sarkaar kii is magazine par likhe slogan ne saaf kar diya he
 At the same time, Kavita Jain, the minister of the Public Relations Department, who removed this magazine after the government's disgrace, is completely silent
 lekin apane bayanon se hameshaa sarkaar ko bachaane vaale haryana ke fire brands ministar anil vij ke paas bhi in sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin he ki kya haryana sarkaar ghunghat koharyana kii shanmaanati he? or kya sarkaar ghunghat pratha ko khatm karne ke paksh main nahin he? anil vij se jab is puure mudde ko lekar sawaal kiya gaya to wo paramparaon kii duhai dene lage lekin parampara ke naam par sarkaar kis tarah se apni sankeern maansikta mahilaon ke saamne rakh sakati he is baat ko lekar unke paas koi jawaab nahin tha or wo golmol jawaab dene lage
 Many times the government of India keeps patting its waist by campaigning like "beti Bachao Beti Padhao" and the improved sex ratio of girls in the state at the time of its government, but what the government's ministers and officials really think about women in this government
 An advertisement printed on the magazine's mouthpiece and describing the veil as a government slogan is telling

 in On the day the Supreme Court gave its verdict on the ramjanmabhoomi-babri Masjid dispute, Kailash Vijayvargiya, BJP leader and in-charge of the party's West Bengal, expressed surprise at the Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee not commenting on the subject
 unhone kaha, ''yah ek aitihaasik nirnay tha or ascharyajanak rup se, unki ore se koi pratikriya nahin ai
 Do not do politics on this issue
 '' unke sahyogi or pashchim bengal bhaajapa ke pramukh dilip ghosh ne bhi mamata kii chuppi par sawaal uthaaya
 However, it was not that Didi did not respond
 apni baat rakhane ke liye unhone apni kalam ko chunaa or jo kuch kahana chaahati thim, use ek kavita ke jariye kaha jiskaa sheershak diya 'ansed (avyakt)'
 '' Often, a lot can be said by staying silent
 kuch nahin kahana bhiaksarkuch kehane se zyada taqatvar abhivyakti he
 
 
 On the other hand, the Congress Working Committee decided to issue a small note on the day of the judgment
 usamen kaha gaya he, ''bhartiya rashtriya congress ayodhya maamle main sarvocch nyaayalay ke faisle kaa sammaan karti he
 We appeal to all concerned parties and all communities to follow the secular values and spirit of brotherhood described in the Constitution and to maintain peace and harmony
 yah hamamen se har ek kii jimmedaari he ki ham aapasi sammaan or ekta kii hamaari parampara ko phir se sthapit karen, jo yugon se hamaare samaaj kii pahchaan rahi he
 The opposition parties' nagging reaction to the verdict indicates a change in their political strategies when speaking on issues related to the majority community
 hindu voton ke dhruvikaran se kai chunaavon main bhaajapa ko phayda hua he, jabaki vipakshi dalon par alpsankhyak tushtikaran ke aarope chaspaan ho gaye hai
 In fact, the Congress resorted to soft Hindutva for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 party adhyaksh rahul gandhi mandir-mandir ja rahe the or janeudhari shivbhakt hone kaa daawa kar rahe the
 It is another matter that his efforts to stop the bjp's claim of monopoly on Hindu votes did not yield much results
 faisle par ekmaatr mukhar rajnatik virodh karne vaale, ol india majalis-e-ittehadul muslimin (eiemiem) ke adhyaksh asaduddin ovaisi rahe
 Owaisi, who practiced Muslim politics, called Ayodhya's decision a 'victory of faith over facts'
 vam dalon kii ore se bhi faisle par bahut dabi jabaan main or bahut maamuli aalochana dekhi gai
 a statement from the Communist Party of India (marxist) said, "this decision has provided a judicial solution to this disputed issue, but there are some facts of the decision which also raise questions
" ''ayodhya ke faisle ke baad kii rajnatik shanti vastav main bhaajapa ke liye chintaa kaa kaaran ho sakati he
 An election issue that has been a part of the party's manifesto in every election since the 1990s has ended with the resolution of the dispute going on for decades
 vastav main, bhagava party pashchim bengal main 2021 main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ke liye ek chunavi aakhyaan banane kii koshish kar rahi he
 The BJP is desperate to create a strategy to win this eastern stronghold around the slogan 'jai Shri Ram'
 is saal may ke chunaavon main bhaajapa ke netritv vaale endie ne prachand bahumat ke saath satta main vaapasi kii or apni paraajay ke baad mamata 'jai shri ram' kaa naaraa lagane waalon ko dekhakar saarvajanik rup se apana aapa kho baithi or isane bhaajapa ko baithe-bithaae ek mudda thama diya
 The BJP won 18 out of the 42 seats in the state's Lok Sabha in the general election, while the ruling Trinamool Congress's performance fell and the number where it won 34 seats in 2014 fell to 22 after five years
 chunaav main haar or chunaav ranneetikaar prashanth kishor kii salaah par ve ab bhaajapa ke saath bhagwaan ram se sambandhit kisi bhi maamle par sing ladaane se batch rahi hai
 Instead, they have started a tight monitoring of the performance of their mlas and directed everyone to be more accessible to voters
 sabhi vidhayakon ko disambar ke ant tak apane nirvachan kshetron ke gaanvon main 10 raaten bitaane ko aadesh diya gaya he
 The results of the recent assembly elections in Haryana and Maharashtra have also raised an expectation among opposition parties
 ve dhire-dhire samaj rahe hai ki modi kaa jaadu, hindutv or rashtrawaad, rajyon main bhaajapa ko chunaav jitaane ke liye paryaapt nahin ho saktaa he
 The performance of state governments, local issues and the campaign of the opposition can affect the voting percentage
 bhartiya arthvyavastha gambhir sthiti main he or vipakshi dal chaahate hai ki focus isi par bana rahe taaki bhaajapa ko hindu voton ke dhruvikaran ke liye ayodhya ke faisle ke istemaal kaa mauka hi na mili
 Perhaps that's why Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who will have to face elections early next year, wasted no time in welcoming the verdict and appealing to the people to maintain peace
 chaahe jo bhi ho, ayodhya kaa faisla nishchit rup se narendra modi ke khate kii uplabdhiyon main ijapha karegaa
 After returning to power with a heavy mandate in May, the prime minister lost no time in moving forward on the main issues included in the RSS-BJP agenda — defying Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir in August, and now the Ram temple in Ayodhya Has led the way
 sansad ke pichley satr main teen talaak ko aapraadhik krity banane ko uniform civil code kii ore bhaajapa kii yatra kii shuruyaat ke rup main dekha jaataa he, jo aresas-bhaajapa kii ore se prastaavit kaaryon kii suchi main teesraa ahm agenda he
 These actions have increased the stature of Narendra Modi manifold and the serious question of economic crisis hovering in front of the country is also marginalized
 ayodhya ke faisle ke baad aresas ke ek bhi kaaryakarta ne kaashi yaa mathura ke bare main baat nahin kii he, yah darshata he ki apni raajnneetik praathamiktaaon ko anjaam tak pahunchane ke liye modi-shah ne aresas parivaar main puraa bharosa paidaa kiya he
 Ajay Umat, a political analyst who has kept a keen eye on Modi's growing stature over the years, believes Ayodhya's decision will further enhance his stature
 ve kehete hai, ''ayodhya vivaad ke hal ke liye sanvaidhanik rasta akhriyaar karne kii bajaae kanoonee samaadhaan par bharosa jataane kii baat ke baad, faisle ko haar yaa jeet ke rup main na dekhne kii raashtra se unki apil ke saath-saath, faisle ke baad aresas ko niyantran main rakhane main unki safalataa, yah darshaati he ki unamem ek kushal rajaneta kii kshamtaayen hai
 "even on the international front, Modi has made a mark and his image of the man who leads the work will be strengthened by this
" pakistan main bharat ke purv ucchayukta ji
 Parthasarthy says, "outside India, he will be seen differently now
" faisle ke baad modi ne jaisaa rukh apanaaya, isse unhone apane vaishvik kad ko badhaayaa he
 "yet, whatever Modi has achieved so far could prove to be worthless if he could not save the constantly falling Indian economy
" bharat ke itihaas ko badalane ke liye pradhanmantri or unki party ko jo chunavi badhat mili he, vah jald hi unki mutthi se ret kii tarah sarakane lagegi agar jidipi main giravat kaa daur jari rahaa, naukariyon kii killat bani rahi or ek ke baad ek lagaataar vibhinn sector dharashayi hote rahe
 The Kashmir issue has been resolved, the way to the temple has been cleared in Ayodhya, at the moment they do not have any big issue that can support
