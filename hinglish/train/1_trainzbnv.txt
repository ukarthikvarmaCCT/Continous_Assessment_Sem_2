 Tufail Mattoo died of tear gas, followed by Javed Malla and then Rafiq Bangaru
 lekin uske baad srinagar ko shant kara diya gaya
 But after that demonstrations started in Sopore, it erupted because a local militant was killed in an encounter there
 log ghar se baahar aa gaye, unhone siarpief ko nishaanaa banaaya or duusari taraf se goliyaan chalin or log maare gaye
 Then things moved towards Anantnag, where there was no provocative incident
 ek spasht sabak yah he ki ham mugalate main khamoshi ke saath nahin baith sakate ki kashmir main koi aisa mudda nahin he jiske samaadhaan kii jarurat he

 If you look at the scale, size and extent of these incidents and then look at the casualties in them, i think there is no security force that could have exercised more restraint

 This is the letter written by the principal- kanpur main shanivaar kaa din anshan fishan ke naam rahaa
 The Congress went on a hunger strike against the Samajwadi Party and the main opposition party BJP against the Samajwadi Party citing the deteriorating law and order situation in the state
 saansad shriprakash jaiswal kii aguwai main congressi netaaon ne uttar pradesh sarkaar dwaara kanpur kaa vikaas na kiye jane ke virodh main dharna pradarshan or upwas kiya vahiin bhartiya janata party ne desh main badhati manhagaai ke liye kendra sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehraate huye upwas kiya jabaki samaazaadee party ne kendra sarkaar kii nitiyon or manhagaai ke khilaaf dharna pradarshan kar kendra sarkaar kaa putala foonka
 Union coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal fasted for 3 hours at Clock tower intersection
 unke anshan sthal par jahaan kuch sau netaa or kaaryakarta maujuud the vahi bada chauraahaa par bhaajapa ke dharne main vidhayak satish mahana ke netritv main kuch darjan party kaaryakarta maujuud the

 yatimkhana chauraahey par samaajawaadee party ke vidhayak irfan solanki ke netritv main bhi kuch darjan kaaryakartaaon hi dharna pradarshan or putala phukane ke kaarykram main maujuud the
 When asked by Jaiswal, who is leading the clockwork and fasting, that the BJP is protesting against you and alleging that you did nothing while being a minister at the Center, he said that the people of Kanpur know what i did
 ab bhaajapa vaale mere khilaaf kyon dharna de rahe hai is bare main unase puuchhen
 Jaiswal said that today, the sit-in and fasting of the Congress is in opposition to the Uttar Pradesh government not doing development work
 unhone kaha ki jeenyuarem ke tahat pradesh sarkaar ke jariye kanpur kii puraani siver line badalane or nayi siver line banane ke liye dhanrashi bheji gayi thi
 Apart from this, money was also received for repairing the carved road due to changing the sewer line
 lekin rajya sarkaar ne kahi kahi siver line to badal di he lekin shahar kii zyadatar sadake khudi padi he
 He said that i paid attention to the state government several times but there was no progress in this direction
 jabaki iske liye kendra sarkaar puraa paisa rajya sarkaar ko de chuki he
 Jaiswal said that the law and order of the city as well as the entire state has completely collapsed
 aae din mahilaon ke saath chhedchhad, balaatkaar, hatya or anya jaghanya aapraadhik gatividhiyaan ho rahi he lekin police adhikariyon ko is ore dhyaan dene kii fursat hi nahi he
 On the other hand, the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party, who were protesting and fasting against the central government and MP Jaiswal at Bada Chauraha, alleged that Jaiswal is a three-time MP of the city from the Congress and in spite of this, he has given only his name stones in the name of development Have got the city not developed at all
 sadaken kharaab padi he siver line kaa pani sadako par bah rahaa he

 com / clj0gj6kqj— Congress (@incindia)june 19, 2019aapako bataa den ki rahul gandhi kaa janm 19 june, 1970 ko hua tha
 Talking about his political journey, he became MP for Amethi for the first time in 2004 and in 2009, 2014 also became MP from there
 haalanki, is baar unhen amethi main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa, lekin vah kerala ke vynad se chunaav jitkar sansad pahunche
 In Amethi, Rahul Gandhi has been defeated by Union Minister Smriti Irani
 rahul gandhi kii aguwai main congress ko lagaataar duusari baar loksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he, 2019 main rahul party ke adhyaksh the to vahiin 2014 main chunavi campan ko lead kar rahe the
 In 2014, the Congress was reduced to 44 seats, this time only 52 seats
 loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey aane ke baad rahul ne party adhyaksh pad se istife kii peshkash kii thi, haalanki party is par raji nahin hui
 But Rahul has given the Congress only an ultimatum of 1 month, in the meantime he has said to find a new president

 Many of the important administrative decisions that Shivraj Singh Chauhan has taken in the last three months have been made not from the state secretariat at Vallabh Bhavan, but from the lounge close to the state government hangar at Raja Bhoj Airport in Bhopal
 vajah? madhya july main jan aashirwad yatra ke naam se ujjain se shuru hue apane jansampark kaarykram ke vakt se hi madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri hafte main kam se kam chah din lagaataar daure kar rahe hai
 He took a break of just two weeks in between these visits when former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee died
 aksar aisa hua he ki ve aadhi raat ke baad 3 baje laute or agali subah 9 baje phir nikal gaye
 They have to do this for 18 hours because the Congress has presented a strong challenge to them — so strong that Chauhan believes that such a challenge was not presented to him in 2003, 2008 and 2013, when the BJP has given the three assembly Won elections
 2018 kaa chunaav isliye bhi behad ahm he kyonki iskaa asar 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav par padegaa
 This reality is not hidden from anyone's eyes
 chaihaan aisa kya kar sakate hai ki jisase 15 saal kii satta virdohi bhaavana ko maat de paaen or madhya pradesh ko ek baar phir bhaajapa kii jholii main daal den?tikaton kaa bantwaaraa, baghawat se nibatnabhajapa or uske sangi-saathi tikaton kaa sahi-sahi bantwaaraa karne ke liye teen staron par kaam kar rahe hai
 While Chauhan collects valuable feedback during his visits, bjp's organization is busy in the work of Raishumari with its leaders going to different districts and consulting party officials as to who can be the ideal candidate? Along with it, the Sangh and its people are also forming their opinions
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah jab pichhali baar yahaan aae the tab unhone aresas ke rajya mukhyalay samidha main acha-khaasaa vakt bitaayaa tha
 Madhya Pradesh general secretary (organization) Suhas Bhagat also held a long meeting with field campaigner Deepak Vispute on October 16 at the same place and got the union's feedback about the candidates
 ummidavaaron ke naam tay hone ke baad sangh apane enjio ke network or duusare agua sanghathanon kii puri takat un ummidavaaron ke peeche jhonk degaa or harek nirvachan kshetra main voton ko lamaband karne main jute jayega
 How successful this mobilization is, only time will tell
 isaki vajah yah he ki sangh ke kaaryakarta is baat se pareshaan hai ki jamini str par kaam keval "lenden'' ke baad hi hote hai
 Many feel that in the "peace period", the Chief Minister prefers to work through select bureaucrats and only during the "war" (ie elections) does the Sangh approach
 tis par bhi pehali baar swayamsevi dhadon kaa ek chhatra sanghathan—jan abhiyaan parishad—banaaya gaya he jo rajya sarkaar ke saath kaam karata he or jisamen philhal aresas ke sadasyon kaa jamaavada he
 It is running a program called Systematic Voters Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP or Sweep)
 chunaav ayog ke aadesh par chalaae ja rahe is kaarykram kaa makasad matdaan kaa pratishat badhanaa he, alabatta isse sangh ko matadaataaon se sidhe sampark karne main madad mil rahi he
 This is also the first time that most out-of-state agencies have been tasked to conduct at least 10 surveys to get an accurate land report
 unki raishumaari or nateezon ke aadhaar par ummidavaaron ke naam tay kiye jaaenge or usase pehle yah bhi pataa laga liya jayega ki na keval us nirvachan kshetra main balki aasapaas ke nirvachan kshetron main unke jati sameekaran munasib hai yaa nahin
 Of course, the accuracy of these surveys is in doubt, especially when the survey form has been seen in the hands of BJP leaders claiming ticket
 kuch maamalon main to in netaaon ne apane daavon ko majboot karne kii garaj se khud hi ye form bhar die
 On a large scale, the BJP is moving ahead in a "my booth is the strongest" way
 iske peeche vichaar yah he ki har booth jeeta jaae taaki nirvachan kshetra par jeet pakki kii ja sake
 To overcome the anti-local incumbency, tickets of at least 60 sitting mlas, including some ministers, can be cut
 isaki vajah se paidaa hone vaale asantosh se party kaise nibategi? ek sutara kaa kahana he, "party ne vidhayakon se baatcheet karnaa pehle hi shuru kar diya he
 Those whose tickets will be cut will be told that their defeat was predicted in several surveys
 unhen rajya sarkaar kii companiyon yaa board kii adhyakshata se navajane kaa vaada kiya jayega
 The possibility of giving tickets to the relatives of such leaders or contesting them from the surrounding constituencies is also being considered
 ummid kii ja rahi he ki cader aadhaarit party hone ke naate bhaajapa baghawat se congress ke banisbatan behatar dhang se nibat sakegi
 The juggling of data so far in the Jugatchauhan camp to draw new votes has shown that the bjp's existing votes may not be enough to win
 2013 main bhaajapa or congress ke voton kaa fark 8
 Was 4 percent
 congress ko mahaj 4
 a gain of 2 per cent will bring it on par with the BJP
 yahi vajah he ki vot hissedari main 2
 a plan of 3 percent increase is being made
 ye vot un peshewaron se aa sakate hai jo jaruri taur par bhaajapa ke voter na hon, par chouhan ke haq main vot de sakate hon
 As a result, Chauhan is calling on doctors, lawyers, journalists, army officers and retired bureaucrats, with the hope that not only will they vote in their own favor but also get the votes of those they know
 yahi vajah thi ki bhopal ke chikitsak dow
 H
 ech
 Trivedi was surprised one morning when Chauhan was standing at her door
 dow
 Trivedi has treated several ministers including former chief ministers Arjun Singh, Sundarlal Patwa, Digvijay Singh
 jati ko lekar chal rahe andolan par lagambhajapa sarkaar ne padonnatiyon main aarakshan ke faisle ko abhi tak taal rakhaa he, baavjood iske ki supreme court ne sitambar main hi isaki ijaajat de di thi
 This is an issue which was opposed by the upper castes and backward classes
 ve essi / asti (atyaacharon kii rokthaam) kanoon main agast main kiye gaye sanshodhan kaa bhi virodh kar rahe hai
 The BJP feels that it is best not to take a decision on this issue yet
 ve yah bhi ummid kar rahe hai ki oonchi jatiyon or pichde virgon kaa andolan apana shikhar dekh chukaa he or ab use dhire-dhire khatm hi hona he
 SAPAKS (general, Backward Classes, Minorities Welfare Society), an organization of employees representing general category, backward and minorities, has decided to field candidates
 natijatan, kuch nishchit shahari ilaakon main yah bhaajapa ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 The BJP hopes that the upper castes and the backward will vote for it as it is their natural choice as a party
 jab yah andolan shikhar par tha, tab mukhyamantri ne yah kahkar is aag ko bujhane kii koshish kii thi ki essi / asti kanoon ke tahat jaanch kiye bagaiyr koi maamla darj nahin kiya jayega
 But after that he kept silence for fear of losing the SC / ST vote
 rajya bhaajapa shah kii taraf takataki lagaae he ki ve oonchi jatiyon or pichhadon ke gathbandhan ko todgaye kaa koi na koi rasta nikaalenge
 Populist schemes are officially saying that Chauhan is contesting on the double slogan of development and welfare
 ve hameshaa kii tarah bina ruke rajya main apni uplabdhiyon ko ginate hai
 The Chief Minister, seeking votes for the fourth term, does not seem to lack the achievements
 apni chunaav sabhaaon main mukhyamantri kul jamaa yahi bataate hai ki unhone kitne kilometre sadaken banavaai hai, kitne ilaakon ko sinchai kii jad main laae hai, kitne medical college khole hai or prati vyakti jidipi main kitni oochaal ai he
 One scheme that Chauhan is relying on very much for electoral gains is the Sambal Yojana, which was launched in June
 yah yojana asangathit kshetra ke mazdooron ko lakshya karke banaai gai he or iskaa laabh uthaane waalon main madhya pradesh ke takreeban 5
 2 out of 03 crore voters
 2 karod matadaata shumaar hai
 Its benefits include payment of maternity expenses, tuition fees for children's school and college, waiver of electricity dues and electricity connection at Rs 200 per month
 yah yojana sabhi ke liye he or ise essi, asti yaa obisi tak simit nahin rakhaa gaya he
 While the Congress has clearly taken a soft Hindutva stance, Chauhan is only talking about development and development, with the hope that the "hindu" vote will come in his favor at all times, but in the name of development The vote to be given can also come in their bag
 alabatta "takalifdeh'' muddon par bhaajapa ne khamosh rahane kaa faisla kiya he
 In recent times, no top BJP leader has tried to justify demonetisation or GST
 iske alaava, jiesti kii vajah se vyapaaree varg bhi bahut khush nahin he
 But returning to the theme of "intruders" and the National Citizenship Register (NRC) with a view to strengthening the Hindu vote, they can be clearly seen
 shah ne apni kai jan sabhaaon main iskaa zikr kiya he
 However, there is no direct attempt to polarize, mainly because Madhya Pradesh is not Gujarat and the state has 6
 5 fisadi musalmaan bikhare hue hai
 Tell the farmers, what has been done for them
 Due to Chauhan's popularity for a long time, the agricultural sector itself is going through difficulties today, because the cost of farming like diesel and manure has increased in the last one year
 sadak par pyaaj-tamaato phenkane or vibhinn hisson main andolan karne se jaahir he ki kisaan chouhan se naaraaz hai, jo pichley saal mandsaur ke andolan main jaahir hua tha, vah bhi tab jab usase pehle gehun or dhan ke pichley do saalon ke kharid bonus kaa bhugtan kiya ja chukaa tha, bazaaron main dakhal diya gaya tha or bhavantar yojana laai gai thi
 Chauhan is confident of the support of the farmers
 unhone tivi today ke ek kaarykram main kaha, "congress krishi kshetra main karj maafee kii baat karti he, magar maine kisaanon kii sahaayta ke liye krishi kshetra ko 31,000 karod ru
 Has been given which has never been given before
 '' bhaajapa is tathy par bhi bharosa karke chal rahi he ki kisaan anivaary kisaan ke taur par vot nahin dete balki apni jati ke mutabik vot dete hai
 Take advantage of the internal divisions of the Congress Whenever there is any rift or dispute within the Congress, it is touted as a strategy and it is told how the opposition is not clear who will be their leader
 khaas taur par chouhan or aam taur par unki party is baat ke liye bahut betaab hai ki congress mukhyamantri pad ke apane ummidavaar kaa elaan kare, jisase party abhi tak bachati ai he, taaki chouhan is chunavi ladaai ko agar kamalnath ke naam kaa elaan hota he to "kisanputra banaam udyogpati'' or agar jyotiraditya sindhiya ke naam kaa elaan hota he to "kisanputra banaam maharaja'' main tabdeel kar saken
 They also realize that the Congress can raise issues like Vyapam and illegal digging of sand, which according to the Congress take them straight to the threshold, hence Chauhan is going to insist that any investigating agency and court Did not find anything against him in Vyapam
 ret kii avaidh khudaai ke bare main ve kehete hai, "hamane khanan niti badal di he or ab keval panchayatein hi lij de sakati hai
 "it is noteworthy that the accused in Vyapam case, Dr
 gulab singh kiraar kii bhaajapa sadsyta aarope kii vajah se khatm ho gai to ve congress main shaamil ho gaye
 Dr
 kiraar akhil bhartiya kiraar sabha ke adhyaksh the or ab us pad par chouhan kii patni sadhana singh hai
 The BJP is also relying on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's election campaign, making it 2
 3 fisadi ankon kii badhat milane kii ummid kar rahi he
 He cites the Karnataka and Gujarat elections where he turned the wind
 madhya pradesh main bijepi ummid kar rahi he ki unase bhopal, indore, jabalpur, gwalior, reva or ujjain kii 60-70 shahari siton par madad milegi
 The majority of these seats are still with the BJP
 charchaa yah bhi he ki bijepi yuvaaon or mahilaon ko zyada tikat de rahi he, kyonki inhen tabakon main pradhanmantri modi kii lokapriyata zyada vot khinchakar laaegi
 2018 strategy vs
 previous strategies: The bjp's strategy, however, has flaws, which are quite clear
 ek to yah ki chouhan 2008 or 2013 main apni chunavi naiya ke khewanhaar rahe kendriya mantri narendra singh tomars ko rajya bhaajapa kaa adhyaksh banaakar laane main naakaam rahe
 Another strategist Anil Dave died
 duusare, 2003 main ranneetik yojana ke tahat jawali naam se ek samarpit samooh banaaya gaya tha
 The plan was to field heavy candidates against big Congress leaders and surround them in their seats
 is baar yah chouhan kaa van-main sho sareekha maaloom detaa he, jisamen mantri bhupendra singh or rampal singh sareekhe unke bharosemand sipahasaalar khud apane chunaavon main uljhe hue hai or rajya str par chizon ko sanbhaalane ke liye tajurbekaar log unke paas zyada nahin hai
 On the other hand, Congress does not have Kantilal Bhuria like 203, who has no support base, but this time it is Kamal Nath who has proved his ability to negotiate and take advantage of his relationships with business houses
 press conference or netaaon tak pahunch kii shakl main media ke saath bhaajapa ke meljol main bhi kami ai he, jabaki congress kaa media cell kahin zyada sakriy he
 Not only this, in 2003, 2008 and 2013 elections, BJP attacked Digvijay Singh
 is baar digvijay khud ko hamale ke liye pesh hi nahin kar rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi's roadshows are also drawing considerable crowds and if he continues to draw the same crowd even after ticket distribution, BJP should be concerned
 iske alaava, bhaajapa vidhayakon kaa congress main shaamil hona bhi chintaa kaa vishay he
 Tendukheda MLA Sanjay Sharma and former Bhandar MLA Kamalapat Arya joined Congress in Rahul Gandhi's meeting on October 29 in Indore
 lekin khud chouhan ko puraa bharosa he ki agar unki jan aashirwad yatra ke prati logon kii pratikriya ko ishaara mana jaae to ve jeet hasil kar rahe hai
 Therefore, while Kamal Nath is claiming that every section of society in the state is feeling cheated and thinks nothing has been done for him, Chauhan is saying that everyone is happy and he is being "given any of the government No anti-incumbency or opposition to the program is visible
 rajnatik vishleshak girija shankar kehete haih "kisi bhi survey main bhaajapa ko 100 se kam siten nahin mili hai or mukhyamantri rajya ke sabase lokapriy netaa bane hue hai
 In view of this, i do not see any anti-incumbency that can affect the government
 ''agar dobaaraa chune gaye to chouhan kya karenge? ve kehete hai, "bhavishya ke liye meraa uddeshy madhya pradesh ko desh kaa sheersh rajya bananaa he
 "their plans are to increase the value of agricultural produce and move towards skill-based training that can create jobs
" *** If you or a friend goes to the gym, how long does he do push ups continuously
 
 50, 100 or 150

 Australia's Corton Williams (52) holds the record for doing more than 2500 push ups in an hour and is named in the Guinness World Record

 There were at least eight witnesses whose name was decided by the NIA to be kept confidential
 in gavaahon ko siarpisi kii dhara 164 ke tahat gavaahi deni thi
 Therefore, the agency named these witnesses as 'charlie', 'romeo', 'alpha', 'gamma', 'pie', 'potter', 'harry' and 'cox'
 vatali ko guuruuvaar ko dilli hoicourt se jamaanat mili he
 Her lawyer also complained that the statements of secret witnesses were not provided to her client

 Often we ignore small things and forget the simple rule that it is important to pay attention to specifics
 swasthya beemaa ke maamle main yah baat khaastaur par dhyaan dene kii he
 We also rest assured that our health is considered the honor of God
 apane sharir kaa khyaal nahin rakhte, bahut tanaav lete hai or paryaapt swasthya beemaa bhi nahin karaate
 Staying healthy is the most expensive nowadays and it is realized when we fall ill
 aajkal multi speciality or super speciality aspataalon main behtareen chikitsa milti he, lekin uskaa kharch aasmaan chune vaala hota he
 To overcome this, it is necessary that a suitable health insurance policy is taken
 puraane jamaane main log tex bachaane ke liye swasthya beemaa karaate the
 Then five lakh rupees
 kii seemaa thi or zyaadaatar log use paryaapt maan lete the
 Most people do not understand that health insurance cover remains the same
 usamen mahangaai kaa khyaal nahin rakhaa jaataa
 Inflation increases and along with this, medical expenses
 isliye yah dhyaan rakhana padataa he ki badhati mahangaai ke mutabik cover paryaapt ho
 These things should be kept in mind while purchasing a health insurance policy: If you are younger then your initial premium will be lower
 umr ke saath-saath beemaa company kaa slab paar karne par yah bad jayega
 Policy can be availed at any time
 koi policy na lene se to der se lee gai policy bhalee he
 Details of chronic diseases: If there are some diseases in your family, then you are also at risk of them
 aise main aapako turant policy kharidni chahie
 If you already have a disease, the insurance company will not include its treatment in your policy
 khaskar agar vah beemaari aapke parivaar main bhi he
 In such a situation, choose a policy that covers the disease
 naukari kaa swaroopapake kaam se judi gatividhiyon ke kaaran tanaav se judi bimaariyaan ho sakati hai
 This can be taken care of in your policy
 premiumaap jo policy khareednaa chaahate hai, agar uskaa premium bahut adhik lagata he to utani hi rakam kii policy len, jiskaa premium aap de saken yaa family flotor jaisaa koi sasta vikalp chune
 Choose a plan for yourself and your entire family that is in addition to the insurance benefits you or your wife get from your employer or company
 isse aapako laabh hoga
 Many types of health plans are available nowadays
 vyaktigat, toffp, family flotor, varisht naagarik aadi
 You get confused which plan to take
 apni apekshaayen or chintaaen apane salaahkaar ke saamne rakhen
 This will help you decide what you want to benefit from the policy
 agar aakarshak chhot mil rahi ho to tatkaal aakarshan puure parivaar ke bime kaa hota he
 But think about what will happen when your child turns 21 or 25 years old
 kis aayu tak aapke bujurg mata-pita ko iskaa laabh mil saktaa he
 The insurance industry is still in its early stages, so wants to assure people that all products are the same
 magar yah acchhee tarah jaanch len ki product aapke laayak he yaa nahin
 Finally, please read the policy document with your advisor
 uske niyam, sharton or simaaon ko acchhee tarah samaj len

 *** The idea of creating a National Court of Appeal on the lines of the Supreme Court in four parts of the country has been rejected by the Modi government
 centre sarkaar ne supreme court main kaha ki yah aise chaar court banane se koi phayda nahin hogi
 Problem with pending three crore cases in lower courts: During Rohatgisunwai, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said, 'the real problem is not the cases of the Supreme Court but in the lower courts across the country, the payment is of three crore cases
 aise main supreme court kii tarj par rajyon main chaar court of apil banane kaa koi phayda nahin he
 a public interest litigation was filed by a person named v Vasanth Kumar in the Supreme Court
 yachika main kaha gaya tha ki supreme court kii tarj par desh ke 4 kshetron main neshnal court of apil banaae jaaen
 Where the appeals against the cases decided by the High Court are heard and only such cases should be sent from here for the Supreme Court hearing, which has issues related to constitutional and statute interpretation
 anya maamalon kaa nipataara ye neshnal court aaf apil dwaara kar diya jaae
 This will facilitate people coming to the Supreme Court from far-flung states to get justice
 28 april ko agali sunwyeesupreme courtis maamle main sunwaayee 28 april ko jari rakhega
 In the last hearing, the Supreme Court had said that the central government should explore all possibilities in this case

 Modi and Obama met after UN summit, after which Obama issued a statement
 white house kii aadhikarik website par jari kiye gaye video main obama ne modi kii tarif karte hue kaha- 'urja ke kshetra main president modi ke prayaason se hamen bal mila he
 The White House later corrected this statement of the errant Obamama before it was uploaded on the site, but later, when it was revealed to the authorities, the video was rectified and re-posted on the website
 haalanki obama kii ye galati kisi tarah ke vivaad main nahin ai
 President Obama called Modi a 'good friend' after the meeting on Monday
 unhone kaha ki hamanedonon deshon ke beechasambandhon ko aage le jane or majboot banane ke liye patibaddh hai
 Describing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's journey to reach the top, overcoming the difficulties, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that the real strength of Narendra Modi is his strong intentions
 unke iraadon kii majbootee thik waisi hi he, jaisi khilaadiyon kii hoti he
 When the two leaders were BJP spokespersons 15 years ago, Jaitley looked closely at Modi and found that he (modi) did not relax himself in the matter of discipline and had deep confidence
 jetali ne kaha ki apane inhen gunon ke kaaran vah vikaas ke apane agenda ko virodh ke swaron ke baavjood aage le jate hai
 Due to his qualities, he appears unmatched in the political scene
 soochna evam prasaaran mantralay kii jimmedaari bhi sambhaal rahe arun jetali ne kaha, sarkaar main rahete hue, yah kehane kii jarurat nahin ki vah behad mehnatee hai or lagaataar kaam karte rahete hai
 They clearly know about each department and what to do
 pradhanmantri modi ke utthan ke bare main jetali ne kaha ki is disha main unke kai gunon kaa yogadan he
 Modi is very sharp, has a great passion for learning and is capable of aligning himself as an international leader
 jetali ne kaha, unamem seekhney kii gajab kii lagan he or isliye vah yahaan tak pahunche hai
 
 
 And now that he is getting a chance to make his mark in diplomacy, you can see that within a few months he has emerged from a chief minister to a prime minister and then a powerful international leader
 jetali ne kaha, mujhe nahin lagata ki rajnatik paridrishy main aise zyada log honge, jo yah sab itani teji se kar sake honge
 On Modi's passion and his steadfast focus on the target, Jaitley said, "I think his real strength was shown when he went to Gujarat
" 
 
 mujhe lagata he ki vah unki sweekaaryata kii asli pariksha thi
 Indirectly referring to the examination taken by law and media during the 2002 Gujarat riots, Jaitley said that Modi ruled the state, focusing on the development agenda without being disturbed by 'anti-voices'
 2002 dangon ke baad modi ke saamne pesh ai kathinaaiyon ke bare main jetali ne kaha ki adhiktar log unke nazariye ko saamne laane tak ke liye taiyaar nahin the, lekin unhone media kii parvaah kiye bina sidhe janata se samvaad kiya or apana rodmap tathaa agenda taiyaar kiya
 
 
 This agenda was the development of Gujarat
 jetali ne kaha, or jo maine unke majboot iraadon kii baat kahi, (main kahana chahta hum) ki vah agle 10- 12 saal tak is agenda se bhatke nahin or apane aalochakon ke agenda par pratikriya dene kii bajaay unhone apane agenda ko centre main rakhaa or antat: safal hue
 Describing Modi's capabilities, Jaitley said, he has great faith in himself and his work
 is sandarbh main unhone modi dwaara antarrashtriya kootneeti ke manch par hindi ke istemaal or taatkaalik taur par angreji main die bhaashanon kaa hawala diya
 Recently Modi gave a speech in English in Australia
 centre main sarkaar chalaane kii unki kshamtaaon ke bare main jetali ne kaha ki tamaam aalochanaon ke baavjood unke (modi ke) paas gujarat main sarkaar chalaane kaa 12 saal kaa anubhav he
 Modi himself is very hardworking and always engaged in work
 vah is baat ko lekar puri tarah spasht hai ki sarkaar ke prayek vibhaag ko kya karnaa he
 He said, he has a special grip on it
 unka najariya bilkul spasht he
 He keeps taking information from his original team as well as bureaucrats and ministers in his office
 380 acre main failaa hua gurugram ke aravali biodivarsity park kaa astitv khatre main he
 It took 7 years for the common citizens and local ngos of Gurugram to build this park known as Green Lung of Gurugram, but now it is proposed to take the Gurugram Manesar Expressway in the middle of this beautiful Aravalli Habitat, The work is set to start in November
 ye biodivarsity park aravali ke belt par basaa hua he jis par 7 saal pehle khanan mafiaon kaa raaj tha jiske kaaran yahaan jameen puri tarah khokhli or banjar ho gai thi
 But people worked hard day and night, with the help of corporate and Gurugram Municipal Corporation, filled this desolate place with the flora and trees of Aravali
 ye jangal ab 400 alag-alag kism ke ped-paudhon or pakshiyon kii kareeb 182 spishij kaa ghar he, jahaan junglee siyaar or reptiles bhi rahete hai
 The park has three types of tracks, running track, walking track and cycling track used by people who come here every morning and evening, but in a few months it will be destroyed due to the construction of the highway
 gurugram puri tarah se hai rising societes or badi-badi multinational companiyon kaa kancreet shahar ban chukaa he
 Here the green areas in the city are negligible
 is bich haive project main park kaa kareeb 25 acre kshetra lene kii taiyaari he jis par is park ko taiyaar karne main pramukh bhoomika nibhaane vaale botonist vijay dhasmana kaa maananaa he ki kyonki ye express-ve is jangal ke bich-bich se nikaalane kii taiyaari he
 This will have a direct effect on the birds and flora and most of the species will be destroyed
 gurugram main jahaan pani kii samasya har din gahari hoti ja rahi he, aise halaaton main ye park saal bhar main kareeb-kareeb 28-28 lakh karod ton pani ground level tak pahunchaata he
 This forest also has its own natural water reserve and the best thing is that the trees and plants here do not need much care or water
 ye gurugram ke badhate taapmaana ko niyantrit karte hai, shuddh hawa pradaan karte hai or ground level par pani kii maatra ko badhaane main yogadan de rahe hai
 But after the express-web in the park, nothing will be left due to the smoke of the trains passing through it daily
 hamane is babat sarkari vibhaagon se sampark kiya par kisi ne bhi is par hamen koi jawaab nahin diya
 In such a situation, how will the trees being cut in the name of development and the ravaged forests be replenished is a big question

 Talking to reporters, Singh said that even though the Chief Minister should remain silent today about the raids, he will have to answer before the people of the state if not today
 unhone kaha ki yah sabhi jaanate hai ki builder dilip suryavanshi or khadaan maalik sudhir sharma ke kis se or kaise sambandh hai
 He said that the receiving of the note-sheets related to the transfer of ministers from the residence of Suryavanshi proves that he had direct interference in power
 unhone kaha ki jin mantriyon kii noteshits chaape main mili hai unke khilaaf karrwai hona chaiye
 He said that a pistol of Culture Minister Laxmikant Sharma was also found from the residence of Sudhir Sharma in the raid, while he did not mention this pistol in the affidavit given during the 2008 election, even declared in the Legislative Assembly
 He did not even mention it in his wealth
 netaa pratipaksh ne anna hajaare or baba ramdev ke saath dilip suryavanshi or sudhir sharma ke chitra jari karte hue anna or baba ramdev se poocha he ki chhaapon ke baad ab ve chup kyon hai
 In response to a question, Singh termed Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan as a gimmick, saying that he always does gimmick by fasting or agitating against the Center, but instead of fasting, the Congress will go to the public with these raids
 unhone pradesh kii bhaajapa sarkaar par abhivyakti kii swatantraaa samaapt kiye jane kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki jahaan samachar patron ko dhamkaaya ja rahaa he vahiin mangavalar ko jab unhone in chhaapon ko lekar kuch hordig nagar main lagaaye the unhen prashasan kii sahaayta se hatwa diya gaya
 He said that eight years ago, where Suryavanshi had only 13 dumpers, now he has 1820 dumpers and similarly eight years ago an ordinary teacher has now become the highest income tax payer in the state
 unhone kaha ki donon ne bhaajapa ke satta main aane ke baad hi andhadhundh tareeke se paisa kamaaya he or jaahir he yah paisa unhone eemaandaaree se nahin kamaaya hoga
 In response to another question, Singh said that if the finger is pointed at someone in the Congress regarding the relationship with the two persons, then that person is capable of answering himself

 But fate had thought of something else for him
 jiske liye unhone ek institute bhi jwine kiya tha

 praan kaa vaise filmon main aana koi tay nahin tha
 It happened that once writer Mohammad Wali Nepran was seen standing at a paan shop, at that time he was planning to make the Punjabi film 'yamla Jat'
 pehali hi najar main vali ne yah tay kar liya ki praan unki film main kaam karenge
 He persuaded Pran to act in the film

 Evening 6 from CST to Kalyan
 29 kii local main maharashtra ke mukhyamantridevendra fadanvisane aam yatriyon ke saath baithkar unase baaten karte hue safar kiya
 In fact, the Chief Minister was to go to Kalyan to participate in a program on Monday evening
 unka kaarykram subah se hi kaaphi vyast tha isliye ve subah se hi time bachaane par jor de rahe the
 He also boarded the boat from the gateway to go to Alibaug in the morning
 waapas laute to kulaba main ek kaarykram main shaamil hue
 It takes a long time to reach Kalyan by road, so after finishing the program of Kulaba, the convoy of CM reached CST station directly
 vahaan 6
 Kalyan Local of 29 was standing on the platform
 jab achaanak siem apni team ke saath is local ke ek dibbe main chadhe to logon ko sukhad aashcharya hua
 In the evening, the crowd of Aamumbankar returning home from the office was at the CST station
 aise main siem ke saath unki suraksha main lage javaanon kii badi team dekhakar kai yatriyon kii bhunhe tan gayi thi, lekin jab siem ne local ke dibbe main pahunchakar yatriyon se baat karnaa shuru kii to maahaul saamaanya hota chalaa gaya
 Many passengers requested the CM to make any arrangement to reduce congestion in local trains
 mobile phone ke kai camere ek saath chaalu ho gaye
 Somebody was taking selfies and some were making videos
 kai yatriyon ne to sidhe apane ghar par phone lagaakar siem kii baat hi apane ghar waalon se karvaa di
 CM kept trying to fulfill many kind of urges and thus on Monday 6
 29 kii siasti-kalyaan local kaa safar kai logon ko liye yaadgaar ban gaya

 com / wmeduvhxii — ANI UP (@aninewsup) June 23, 2019 The meeting is attended by all national and state leadership officials and zonal coordinators
 is baithak main mayawati deshbhar main bahujan samaaj party ke vistaar karne, nai ranneeti banane, uttar pradesh upachunaav kii taiyaariyon or party main badlaav ko lekar charchaa karengi
 During this time, Mayawati can clear the situation with the BSP office bearers of the Samajwadi Party (SP), so that there is no dilemma among the party workers about the break-up of the alliance
 loksabhaa chunaav main bahujan samaaj party or samaajawaadee party ne milakar chunaav ladaa tha
 However, both parties did not get satisfactory results
 bahujan samaaj party ko uttar pradesh kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se sirf 10 or samaajawaadee party ko mahaj 5 siton par hi jeet mili
 Mission-2022 aims to prepare the way for the 2022 assembly elections with the help of the BSP by-election
 loksabhaa chunaav main mili safalataa ke baad se upi main number do kii haisiyat milane se mayawati ko lagane laga he ki party upachunaav main bhi bahut zyada siton par safalataa hasil kar legi or agle vidhansabha chunaav main bhi baaji maar sakati he
 Like the Lok Sabha elections, there is nothing for the BSP to lose in the by-election of the assembly, there is also a whole lot of ground to win and the potential to fight
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi kii lahar or sapa-congress gathbandhan se akele loha lekar bhi mayawati apana 'base vot' bachaane main safal raheen hai
 That is why the BSP chief has decided to try his hand alone in the by-election of the alliance's bagger
 basapa pramukh mayawati ke paas upachunaav kii 11 main se kam se kam chaar siton par jeet kii ummiden sajaane kaa aadhaar jarur he
 Sources say that it was agreed between the two parties in the alliance that the SP will give its consent by presenting Mayawati as the Prime Minister in the Lok Sabha elections, while the BSP will support Akhilesh Yadav as Chief Minister in the 2022 assembly elections
 basapa centre kii raajnneeti main rahegi or sapa upi kii siyasat ko sanbhaalegi
 That is why a coalition was formed, but the election results came in favor of the BJP and the plans of both of them were rekindled
 haalanki, bhavishya kii raajnneeti ke liye mayawati shaayad abhi samiksha or sanghathan kii takat parakhane ke mood main hai
 Perhaps this is why even after breaking the alliance for the by-election, the option of joining hands again with the SP has been kept open, saying that there is no breakup
 upachunaavon ke nattejey kaaphi had tak ek ishaara kar hi denge ki ab akele siyaasi safar basapa ke liye mushkil hoga yaa saamaanya

 vaah hindi main likhaa to kuch kavi sa ho gaya!! # 2zero 18 bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi has questioned the need for talks between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif at a time when militant 'day and night' army personnel and innocent in Jammu and Kashmir Killing people
 trichi main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue guuruuvaar ko modi ne pakistan se nipatane ke liye ‘ek kamjor niti kaa paalan’ karne par centre ko aade haath liya
 Modi said, 'how does it happen that Pakistani soldiers come to our land and cut our soldiers' throats and take their heads with them? What is the reason that the Pakistani army kills our jawans on the border and Delhi's government calls for protocol on feeding biryani to the Pakistani Prime Minister? ' gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne kaha, ‘jang ke maidan main jitne sainik shahid nahin hue, usase zyada to aatankwaadiyon kii goliyon kii bhent chadh gaye
 i am angry that there is such a government in Delhi
 ’ Significantly, in the double suicide attack that took place today, militants targeted a police station and an army camp in Jammu region, in which 10 people, including an army lieutenant colonel, were killed
 yah hamalaa aise samay main hua he jab 29 sitambar ko bharat or pakistan ke pradhanmantri neuyork main mulaakaat karne vaale hai
 Regarding the proposed conversation, Modi said, "I want to ask you one question - when our soldiers and innocent civilians are being killed day and night, terrorists continue to harass us, killing our innocent people If in such a situation, is it not a hasty decision of the Central Government that it is talking to Pakistani leaders? '' modi ne kaha, ‘ek sawaal har naagarik ke jehan main aata he ki kya ham vaaki itane kamjor hai ki hamaare padosi jo chaahe karen or ham koi pratikriya na karen
 Why are we being forced to close our eyes and bear these tortures silently
 ’’ In his address, Modi also targeted the Center on the issue of arrest of Indian fishermen by Pakistan and Sri Lanka
 modi ne kaha, ‘pakistan gujarat tat ke paas badi taadaad main machuaaron ko giraftaar kar letaa he or unhen chah maheene se saal bhar jail main rakhata he
 They are tortured
 srilanka bhi ab yahi tarika apnaane laga he
 Actually the problem is not in the sea, but in the center
 ’ Appealing to the people to overthrow the UPA government, Modi said that a weak government at the center has made India's neighbors courageous
 modi ne kaha, ‘aisi sthiti kii sabase badi vajah yah he ki padosi desh bharat ko halke main lete hai
 This is the main reason for these problems
 ’tippaniyan On the issue of two Indian fishermen being shot dead by two Italian marines in February last year, Modi said, 'I am surprised that people come from Italy 1

 Tejashwi Yadav, former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, attacked Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and said that it was the fault of us that we made you CM
 tejasvi bihar ke purv mukhyamantri jeethanram maanjhi dwaara patna ke gandhi maidan main yojit garib mahasammelan main bol rahe the
 Please tell that Nitish Kumar said a few days ago that some people became leaders due to our mistake
 haalanki unhone kisi kaa naam nahin liya tha lekin mana ja rahaa he ki nitish kumaar ne purv mukhyamantri jeethanram maanjhi ke liye yah baat kahi thi
 Now, Tejashwi Yadav directly responded to Nitish Kumar and said that hardly any state in India should have four governments in four years
 unhone kaha ki bihar sarkaar ne mohan bhagwat ko bulaakar danga bhadakaane kaa kaam kiya
 He also alleged that the Bihar government is being run from Nagpur
 purv mukhyamantri jitram maanjhi ne ye sammelan isliye bulaayaa tha kyonki mukhyamantri pad par rahete hue unhone jo 34 faisle liye the usamen se ek bhi faisla mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne lagu nahin kiya, haalanki maanjhi ko mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne hi banaaya tha
 Manjhi requested Nitish Kumar to implement those decisions
 jeethanram maanjhi ne mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se guzarish kii ki wo faisla hamane liya he use lagu karen
 Manjhi said that the dream we had gone to NDA could not be fulfilled
 maanjhi ne kaha ki mainepradhanmantri narendra modise anurodh kiya tha ki nyaayik seva main bhi aarakshan lagu kiya jaye lekin pradhanmantri ne ise ansuna kar diya
 He said that due to less participation of Dalits in the justice system, Dalits do not get justice
 maanjhi ne lalu prasad yadav kii maang kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki jatigat janaganana kii report ko saarvajanik kiya jaae, jo bahujati hai, jo pichde hai unhen phayda milanaa chahie
 Manjhi said that the condition of Dalits in the country is not good
 is maukey par tejasvi yadav ne jamkar bijepi par nishaanaa saadhaa or kaha ki maujuuda centre sarkaar aarakshan virdohi he or ye aarakshan khatm karnaa chaahate hai
 They are anti-dalit
 samaaj main nafrat failaana chaahate hai
 BJP wants to end the country's culture
 unhone kaha ki bijepi ke sirf 6 agenda hai
 Temples, mosques, riots, Hindus, Muslims and Pakistan and all these are only to wander the public
 tejasvi ne kaha ki lalu yadav janata kii aawaaj uthaate rahe lekinbijepi or nitish kumaarane unhen pareshaan kiya or fansaane kaa kaam kiya
 Union Minister Giriraj Singh is accused of grabbing Dalit land but nothing happened to him
 lalu ji ne koi gunaah nahin kiya lekin phir bhi unhen fansaa diya gaya
 Manjhi said that we want to make a request to Nitish Kumar that the liquor ban law of his should be amended, because Dalits and the poor are suffering the most from it, innocent people are being caught
 haalanki hamane nitish kumaar ke sharabbandi kanoon kaa sabase pehle samarthan kiya tha lekin abhi jo bhi sthiti he usase yahi lag rahaa he ki is kanoon kaa istemaal sirf garib or dalit ke liye hi ho rahaa
 Tejashwi Yadav said that the alliance has been strengthened with Jitan Ram Manjhi joining the grand alliance

 ’ The attention of the entire nation is on the ongoing assembly elections in five states, in such a situation that there was not much discussion of an important incident on 10 February in Lutyens' Delhi
 is din bhartiya rajasav seva (iares), bhartiya police seva (ipies), bhartiya railway seva (iares) sahit pratham shrenee kii 20 sevaaon ke adhikariyon ne pradhanmantri karyaalay main rajya mantri jitendra singh se mulaakaat kar do took shabdon main kaha ki centre sarkaar ke sheersh padon par bhartiya prashasnic seva (iees) ke adhikariyon ke ecchhatra raaj ko khatm kiya janaa chahie
 While these officials wanted to meet the Prime Minister directly under the banner of the Confederation of Civil Services Association (koxa), the PMO initially asked Jitendra Singh to look into the matter
 in adhikariyon kii sidhi maang he ki bharat sarkaar main sachiv, atirikt sachiv or sanyukt sachiv jaise padon par unhen bhi barabari kaa mauka mili
 There are some things to know before understanding this battle of equality
 jaise, bharat main prashasan chalaane ke liye civil seva kii pravesh pariksha kaa aayojan sangh lokseva ayog (upiessi) karata he
 Successful candidates are sent to 37 types of services including IAS, IFS, IPS, IRS on merit basis
 kaayade se in sevaaon main pahunche sabhi adhikariyon ko pratiniyukti par centre sarkaar main oonche padon par baithne kaa samaan adhikaar he
 But the practical situation is the opposite
 saatven vetan ayog kii report ke mutabik, sachiv str ke 80 fisadi pad, atirikt sachiv str ke 92 fisadi pad or sanyukt sachiv str ke 64 fisadi padon par sirf iees afasaron kaa kabja he
 How upset the other officers are with this situation, Justice A
 A
 of the Seventh Pay Commission
 ke
 Mathur in his report said, "the reason for the resentment among the officers of the rest of the services is that for a long time, the IAS officers have captured all the powers of administration and pushed the officers of the other services to secondary status
 shikaayat kii mukhya vajah yah he ki chaahe technical ho yaa prashasnic, adhikansh kshetron main sabhi pad aaj iees afasaron ke paas hai
 Now the time has come when the government steps in to make the posting based on expertise
 agar sabhi sevaaon se eemaandaar or barabari kaa vyavhaar nahin kiya gaya to iees or anya sevaaon main khai badhati jaaegi
 Eventually, it will create chaos that will not be good for the administration and the country
 " pratinidhimandal ke saath jitendra singh se milane gaye coksa ke sanyojak or iares association ke mahasachiv jayant mishra kehete hai, ''hamaara sangharsh kisi vyakti vishesh yaa seva ke viruddh nahin he, balki ham yah chaahate hai ki deshhit main karmath or eemaandaar vyaktiyon, chaahe ve kisi bhi seva ke hon, unhen uchit padon par padasth kiya jaae, taaki ve desh kii unnati ke liye samuchit yogadan de saken
 "the first problem of IAS civil servants without discrepancy in pay and promotions is that everyone gets the same salary at the time of appointment, but after four years when officers move from junior time scale to senior time scale, IAS officers get two additional increments
 
 isi tarah senior time scale se junior administration grad main pahunchane par phir se do atirikt increment milte hai
 The same thing is repeated in further promotions
 saatven vetan ayog ne is visangati ko dur karne kii sifarish kii thi
 Officers of other services also complain that the promotion of IAS officer is done on time, while their files are stuck for a long time
 pratiniyukti main pebbnya sevaaon ke adhikariyon kii badi chunauti deputesan main unhen kam tarjeeh milanaa he
 a panel of officers capable of deputation is formed at the level of Joint Secretary from every service
 phir is panel se vibhaag jarurat ke hisaab se adhikari chhaant lete hai
 a member of Cosca said, "deputations are far-fetched, step-by-step treatment starts with the formation of the panel
" sanyukt sachiv ke liye jahaan iees ke 1999 batch tak kaa panel gathit ho chukaa he, vahiin ipies kaa 1993 batch kaa, iares kaa 1990 batch kaa or railway services kaa to 1987 batch kaa hi panel gathit ho paaya he
 When the panels are not formed, how will they go on deputation? ”A senior IRS officer pointed out that the most important role in this work is that of the personnel department and the civil service board
 lekin carmik vibhaag main sachiv, donon atirikt sachiv or chhahon sanyukt sachiv iees cader ke hai, isliye baaki sevaaon ke saath nyaay kaise ho paaegaa? civil seva board par bhi puri tarah iees kaa kabja he
 The situation is that in June 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi directed the formation of the panel till December 2015 for the 1995 batch of the rest of the services, but the panel has not been formed even after 14 months after the deadline has passed

 Police is talking about investigating, but waiting for this investigation, Aam Aadmi Party workers were camping in the police station till late night and the police could not ascertain through the night whether the attackers were Congress men or not

 iske do din pehle hi dilli hoicourt ne sonia gandhi kii us apil ko khaarij kiya tha jisamen jila adaalat dwaara herald maamle main jila adaalat ne unhen or rahul ko saman jari kiya tha
 Ram Jethmalani wrote to Sonia in the letter, 'I know that there are many big lawyers in your party, yet if you need, my service is available to you
 jethmalani ne khat main ye bhi spasht kiya ki is maamle main sonia or rahul kii pairvi karne ke liye unhen fees bhi nahin chahie
 sonia-rahul did not do anything wrong: Jethmalani Jethmalani believes that Sonia and Rahul have done nothing wrong and they are willing to defend them without any fees
 unhone kaha ve hameshasvachh raajnneetike liye kaam karte hai
 Despite sonia-rahul's mistake, what happened in Rajya Sabha was not right
 jethmalani ne kaha ki neshnal herald maamle main sonia-rahul par shaq karne kaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 The charge sheet filed against both is false and malicious
 sonia ne nahin sweekaar prastavsonia gandhi ne abhi tak unke prastaav ko sweekaar nahin kiya he
 On not getting a reply to the letter, Jethmalani again wrote a letter to him on 12 December

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The Muslim community's response to the Supreme Court's decision on the Ayodhya dispute on November 9 was more or less similar
 niraashaa, samarpan or raahat
 Obviously, this community is not tied into one political door and the response is divided at various levels
 yah varg, kshetra or yahaan tak ki iske bheetar ke panthon se judi nishtha se prabhavit he
 Community leaders and clerics are not happy with the legal outcome of the case, but they seem to have accepted it peacefully
 aam musalmaan is mudde ko dafn kar dena hi behatar maan rahe hai
 The decision may not be in their favor, but the biggest dispute of this community with the Hindus is finally 'resolved' and they can continue in their daily work
 hindutv sanghathanon ke aadhipaty ko dekhte hue, kuchhek ko chhodkar anya muslim netaaon ne faisle ko pehle se tay nattejey kii tarah sweekaar kar liya he or ve nahin chaahate ki yah ab rajnatik vimarsh main bana rahe
 Soon after the verdict, senior advocate for Muslim litigants in the Supreme Court, Zafaryab Jilani said, "we are not satisfied with the Supreme Court's decision but we will respect it
" musalamaanon ko di jane vaali paanch acre vaikalpik bhoomi kaa unke liye koi mulya nahin he
 "most Muslim religious leaders are disappointed with the verdict but are not willing to take it further in the courts
" kolkata ke tipu sultan islamic centre ke purv shahi imam, nur ur-rahamaan barkati is masale kaa parityag karte najar aate hai, ''jaj bhi insaan hai or allaah kii tarah sarvocch nahin hai
 Therefore, it is not that the verdict they give is not wrong
 main samajhataa hum ki iske baad koi bahes yaa phir samiksha yachika daayar nahin hogi, lekin yah baat bhi sach he ki muslim samudaay faisle se dukhi he
 That chapter is now closed
 hamen baari man se faisle ko sweekaar karnaa hoga kyonki ek samudaay ko nyaay mila
 
 
 While injustice to the other community
 deshbhar ke musalmaan khamosh hai kyonki unhen koi ummid nahin dikhaai detii
 "the case was about the ownership of the land and the Supreme Court did not clarify who is the rightful owner of the land," says Mufti Abul Qasim Nomani, vice-chancellor of the Islamic University Darul Uloom Deoband
 ham maanate hai ki koi masjid allaah kii sampatti he or musalmaan iske maalik nahin ho sakate hai
 '' Shahi Imam of the 17th century Fatehpuri Mosque in Delhi, Mufti M
 mukarram ahamed faisle ko lekar kisi bhram main nahin hai
 "obviously, the court's decision was not based on merit, but on faith," he says
 '' haalanki, ve faisle ko is masale ke vyaavhaarik samaadhaan ke rup main dekhte hai
 He says, "while trying to take care of the sentiments of Muslims in the judgment, the court has also ordered the government to give a plot to build a mosque
" '' is faisle ke baad sabhi samudaayon kii paripakv pratikriya se ve prabhavit hai
 He says, "what touched my heart was the appeal of Hindu organizations like RSS and VHP not to celebrate the decision as a victory
" muslim sanghathanon ne bhi niraashaa ke baavjood logon se shanti kii apil kii
 The country has shown a lot of maturity after this decision
 ''bharat ke vibhinn muslim sanghathanon ke ek sangh, ol india muslim majalis-e-mushaavrat (mmm) ke mahasachiv naved hamid ke liye bhi yah shantipurna pratikriya raahat bhari he
 Muslim organizations are disappointed with the contradictions of this decision, but no street protests and incidents like violence took place
 ve kehete hai, ''supreme court ne mana ki murtiyon ko 1949 main vivaadit sthal par rakhaa gaya or yah kanoon kaa ulanghan tha
 It also condemned the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992
 phir bhi isane jameen ko duusare paksh ko de diya
 Despite such discrepancies and concerns, Muslims have welcomed the verdict
 ''khaskar uttar pradesh ke shiya samudaay ke netaaon ne hinduon ke daawey ko lekar hameshaa naram rukh apanaaya he
 Even then, they are disappointed with the Supreme Court's dismissal of the Shia Central Waqf Board claim and the five acres of land given to the Sunni side
 shiya central vakf board ke adhyaksh wasim rizvi kehete hai, ''main hameshaa se ayodhya main ram janmabhumi sthal par ram mandir ke paksh main tha
 The Babri Masjid was built by a Shia Mir Baqi
 isliye jameen sunni vakf board ko dene ke bajaae shiya central vakf board ko di jaani chahie thi
 "ayodhya is a sacred place for Hindus," says Kalbe Sadiq, a prominent Shia cleric
 supreme court ke faisle se hinduon or musalamaanon ke bich sauhaard badhegaa
 i am not in favor of Muslims appealing against this decision
 vastav main, main ayodhya main masjid banane ke paksh main nahin hum, masjid kahin or bhi banaai ja sakati he
 The Bohri community has also welcomed the verdict
 ujjain main bohari muslim netaa jaahid bandookwaala kehete hai, ''supreme court kaa faisla tarksangat he
 "the common Muslim is accepting the decision to bury the issue
" bhopal ke kushal majdoor abdul hafeez kehete hai, ''bhale hi mandir banane ke liye hinduon ko jameen de di gai ho, par mujhe raahat he ki maamle kaa patakshep ho gaya he
 Muslims were unable to pray there anyway
 ummid he, vah mudda khatm ho jayega jise sirf siyaasi phaayde ke liye jinda rakhaa gaya tha
 The community's response is primarily that the verdict is more political than legal
 bhopal ke urdu akhbaar nadeem ke maalik saiyad shamsul hasan aarif bhi aisa hi maanate hai
 But they say, "still Muslims believe that if this was to be resolved amicably, then this is also the best possible solution to this issue
" ''muslim siyaasi varg main pratikriya akramakata se lekar vyaavhaarikta tak faili hui he
 Local political reasons are also playing a role in this because Muslim leaders are also eyeing votes from the future
 un ilaakon main pratikriya alag he jahaan muslim ummidavaaron ko voton ke dhruvikaran se laabh hua he
 At the same time, the response of Asaduddin Owaisi, Lok Sabha MP and All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) President, is in line with expectation
 faisle ke din hyderabad main media se baat karte hue unhone kaha, ''supreme court sarvocch he par aisa bhi nahin he ki usase koi galati nahin ho sakati
 Call it a mockery of justice or whatever, the Supreme Court has given the responsibility to build the temple by building a trust to the same people who destroyed the Babri Masjid in 1992
 agar 1992 main masjid ko dhwast nahin kiya gaya hota to supreme court ne kya faisla sunaaya hota? bharat ke musalmaan samvidhan main vishwaas karte hai; ham apane kanoonee adhikaron ke liye lard rahe the
 Muslims can be poor and they can be discriminated against, but in spite of this they are able to build a mosque on 5 acres of land in UP themselves
 hamen khayraat kii jarurat nahin he
 i personally feel that this proposal of 5 acres of land should not be accepted
 ''baakiyon ko shaayad ehsaas he ki ram mandir jaise masalon par chunavi dhruvikaran ne unki siyaasi sambhaavnaaon ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he kyonki babari masjid vidhwans ke baad sansad main muslim pratinidhitiv gata he
 The last two Lok Sabha elections lend credence to this notion
 nunh ke congress vidhayak aftab ahamed kehete hai, ''adaalat ke faisle ko sweekaar kiya janaa chahie
 No one is above the law, but the verdict also shows that it has been compromised
 khayr, logon ko ab is mudde se aage baduya chahie
 By the way, no one is sure whether divisive politics will stop after this
 rajd ke varisht netaa or bihar vidhansabha main vipaksh ke purv netaa abdul baari siddiki kehete hai, ''musalamaanon main yah bhi chintaa he ki kuch dalon ne chunavi laabh ke liye hameshaa dharmik aadhaar par logon kaa dhruvikaran kiya he
 They can start such a dispute elsewhere
 dharmik dhruvikaran ke khatme kaa matlab hoga unki ochhi raajnneeti kaa ant
 So they can air the dispute again in a new place to straighten their owl
 hamen aage kahin aise nahin hone dena hoga
 "so will there be such a war in the future?" - along with Romita Dutta, Malik A
 hashmi, amarnath ke
 Menon and Ashish Mishra "call it justice or whatever, but the Supreme Court has given the responsibility to build the temple by building a trust to the same people who demolished the Babri Masjid in 1992"
 "this case was related to the ownership of land and the Supreme Court did not clarify who is the rightful owner

 The Babri Masjid was built by Mir Baqi, a Shia
 isliye jameen ko sunni vakf board kii bajaae hamen diya janaa chahie tha''wasim rizvichairman, shiya centrl vakf board''muslim samudaay kaa yahi maananaa he ki yah faisla kanoonee se zyada rajnatik he

 The UGC said on Wednesday night that most of the prestigious colleges, including Delhi University, have accepted its instructions
 ujisi ne aise din apane aadesh ko doharaaya jab diu ke media samanvayak malay neerav ne mediakarmiyon ko ek esemes bheja jisamen likhaa tha, kulapati ne istipha de diya he
 However, the chancellor's supporters later denied the news
 iske baad kulapati or media samanvayak donon se kaaphi samay tak sampark nahin ho sakaa or baad main neerav ne der raat main media ko ek esemes kar saaf kiya ki kulapati ne istipha nahin diya he
 According to the statement of Malay Nirav, Prof VC Sudhish Pachauri has already made it clear in the press briefing that the faculty members had met the Vice Chancellor and requested him not to resign

 According to the UGC, among the 57 colleges that have agreed to follow the instructions, DU has prestigious colleges
 inamen un collejon ke naam bhi likhe the jinhone teen varshiya snaatak kaarykram lagu karne par apni sahmati di he

 Earlier, Yogi had taken the blessings of Lord Rama by worshiping him on the day of Diwali in Ayodhya, but today the people of Ayodhya also filled Yogi's bag by putting the victory candidate on the forehead of the BJP candidate in the civic elections
 bijepi ke rishikesh upaadhyaay ayodhya ke meyar chun liye gaye hai
 However, disappointed with his defeat, Samajwadi Party candidate Gulshan Bindu blamed the rigging of the administration instead of the development of the Yogi government
 ayodhya membijapi kii jitko lekar bhale hi vikaas banaam dhaandhlee kii siyasat chal rahi ho, lekin bijepi saansad subramanyam swami kii najar main is jeet ke peeche ram mandir kii lahar he
 Swami also claims that the construction of the Ram temple will begin in Diwali next year

 Yogis themselves have come here many times
 yahaan unhone diwali manaai or yaheen se chunaav abhiyaan kaa shankhanaad bhi kiya
 In such a situation, after this victory in the civic elections, it is natural to intensify the speculation that now the work of Ram temple will be speeded up

 sonia gandhi ne kaha he ki ve apane matbhedon ko sulajhaayen or ek-duusare ke khilaaf saarvajanik bayaan dene se bachein
 Sonia Gandhi issued these instructions when Jyotiraditya Scindia's supporters demanded that he be made the chairman of the Pradesh Congress Committee

 Scindia's supporters and some ministers of the Kamal Nath government were campaigning for him by putting up banners and posters in the state

 The effect of Sonia Gandhi's directive is also visible

 Before the meeting of Kamal Nath, on Thursday, Chief Minister Kamal Nath chaired a meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee on Political Affairs, in which Forest Minister Umang Singhar was also present
 baithak ke baad mantriyon ne congress netaaon main chal rahe matbhed par bayaan dene se inkaar kar diya
 The manner in which the state Congress leaders are publicly making statements against each other is also falling on the independent mlas who are supporting the Kamal Nath government from outside
 nirdaleey vidhayak surendra singh shera ne kaha ki yah sarkaar jis tarah se kaam kar rahi he, aisa prathit hota he ki bukamp aayaa he
 He said that seven mlas are supporting the government

 nikhari or khubasurat twachaa paanaa har kisi kaa sapana hota he, khaastaur par ladakiyon kaa
 There will hardly be any girl who is not serious about her looks
 manachaahi twachaa paane ke liye ve bahut kuch karti bhi hai
 Going to the parlor, taking home remedies and not knowing what
 par vahiin kuch ladkiyaan aisi bhi hoti hai jinhen nikhari twachaa to chahie hoti he par ve uske liye mehnat karne se kataraati hai
 If you are also among such girls then there is no need to lose heart
 agar aap chahen to bina kisi mehnat ke bhi khubasurat or nikhari twachaa paa sakati hai
 If you still cannot believe this, then tell you that there is no joke and getting beautiful skin is not a difficult task
 bas aapako karnaa ye he ki khud ke prati samvedansheel bane rahen
 If your skin is dry or oily then you need to be a little more serious
 1
 Drink as much water as you can
 ji haa, ye khubasurat twachaa paane kaa ek nuskhaa he
 This keeps skin moisturized
 saath hi pani pine se twachaa komal or gloing banati he
 2
 jitani baar bhi aap baahar se ghar aaen utani baar chehre ko saaf, thande pani se dhoen
 It is not necessary that you wash face every time with face wash
 pani se bhi cheharaa dhonaa phydemand rahata he
 This cleanses the dirt present on the face and does not close the microscopic stomata
 3
 If you have makeup on your face, try to sleep only after cleaning it
 chehre par bahut der tak mechap laga rahanaa sahi nahin he
 This causes the skin's natural glow to fade
 4
 Getting enough sleep is also very important for beautiful skin
 hamaari neend hamaari body ko richarge karne kaa kaam karti he
 In such a situation, it is very important to get complete sleep to get fresh skin
 5
 In the afternoon, the body should be avoided in the sunlight
 isse twachaa ko nuksaan pahunch saktaa he
 6
 aapkaa khan-paan acha hona chahie
 Also, it is very important that whatever you eat is fresh and if it is nutritious, then nothing can be better than this

 ab ek taraf bhartiya team ke purv captain ravi shastri or maujuuda captain mahendra singh dhoni jaise khilaadi isisi ke is kade ravaiye kii saraahna kar rahe hai, jabaki duusari ore yah sawaal uthaaya ja rahaa he ki ye sabhi gendbaaj abhi tak antarrashtriya str par gendbaaji kar kaise rahe the
 On the other hand, this tough attitude of ICC has caused the most problems to the off-spin bowlers
 darasal, of-spinneron dwaara phenki jane vaali 'doosraa' gend sabase zyada nishane par rahati he, kyonki isi gend ko phenkane ke dauraan gendbaaj kii kohni sabase zyada mudati he
 So, while some of the icc's 'mission cleanup' people are angry, some consider this to be the right step taken late, but it is so certain that now these tough umpires have given many teams their chance in Cricket World Cup 2015 The strategy has to be changed

 jhooth ek aisa shabd he, jisase ham sabhi nafrat karte hai
 But still all of us must have spoken at some time in our life
 haalanki, sabhi kii jhooth bolne kii vajahen ek duusare se kaaphi alag hoti hai
 The most interesting of these is that according to Psychology, it is difficult for people to believe their lies
 lekin ham aapako kuch khaas tips bataa rahe hai jisase aap dusron dwaara bole gaye jhooth ko aasaani se pakad sakenge
 This way people can catch lies
 jab koi vyakti jhooth bolta he to vah apni aawaaj ko saamaanya seouncharkhakar baat karata he
 While the person speaking the truth talks comfortably
 haalanki, isse aap yakini taur par to nahin kah sakate hai ki koi aap se jhooth bol rahaa he yaa nahin, lekin isse andaja jarur lagaaya ja saktaa he
 2
 jab koishkhssooth bolta he to vah apane jhooth par yakeen dilwane ke liye apane body keposhcharase zyada apni baat par jor detaa he
 It is said that there is not much movement in the bodies of the liars
 3
 If you want to catch someone's lie, then try to keep asking the lying person one after the other
 jhooth bolnaa aasaan hota he lekin jhooth ko chupaana mushkil
 Continuous questioning will increase the pressure on the person lying and the truth will come out accidentally by being afraid of that person's mouth
 4
 Everyone knows that while lying, people do not stare into the eyes of the front
 isliye ho saktaa he jo shaks aapse jhooth bol rahaa he vah khud ko sahi sabit karne ke liye aapaki ankhon main ankhen daalkar apni baat kahe
 Expert to say that the person who tells the truth speaks with a very calm nature in your eyes, while the person who lies tries to look in the eyes forcefully
 5
 If a person talks to you for a long time then you are able to read the mind of the person in front
 jhooth bolne vaala shaks jabardastee expressant dene kii koshish karata he, jisase ye pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he ki saamne vaala shaks kitna sachcha he or kitna jhootha
 In Delhi, the murders of miscreants are high

 The latest case is of Karkardooma Chowk
 jahaan bike savaar dobadmashophis se ghar laut raheen ek mahila kaa purse chhinakar faraar ho gaye
 The robbery happened with 39-year-old Rekha last evening
 darasal rekha kadakadduma ke didie flats main parivaar sang rahati hai
 She works privately in Dwarka
 beeti shaam vah offis se ghar laut rahi thim
 Around 6 in the evening Rekha was leaving Karkardooma metro station and was walking towards the house on foot
 tabhi kadakadduma chowk par bike savaar do yuvak unke paas aae or unke haath sepperschhinakar cross river mal kii taraf bhaag gaye

 Everyone said that they have to pay 12 to 18 per cent GST on old goods, due to which those people are losing money
 maal aage nahin bik rahaa he
 Some people have said that there is a GST of five percent on top of new shoes and when these shoes become old and come to the depot for recycling, they have to pay 18 percent GST on it
 sawaal yah bhi uthta he ki ye log apni pocket se to jiesti nahin de rahe hai phir inkaa nuksaan kaise ho rahaa he
 If these people give GST to buy old goods, then when they sell these goods to the recycling industry, then they also take GST from them and sell them to the people by applying GST on their goods from the recycling industry
 to yahaan aap kah sakate hai jiesti to aam aadmi de rahaa he to phir ricycling industry, thekedaar in logon kii kaise nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Actually, the reason is that due to GST, the prices of new goods have come down and the prices of goods made from recycling have gone up
 nae saamaan or ricycling ke bane saaman kaa rate lagbhag aasapaas pahunch gaya he jisaki vajah se log nae saamaan kharid rahe hai or ricycling se bane saamaanon kii bikri kam ho gai he
 If the goods made from recycling are not selling, then the demand for the old goods used for recycling has reduced
 agar ricycling industry ne maal lenaa kam kar diya he to thekedaaron ne bhi kabadiyon se maal lenaa kam kar diya he, jisaki vajah se kabadiyon ko apana maal ko jamaa karnaa pad rahaa or kam paise main bechnaa pad rahaa he
 You can say that when the demand has reduced, the prices have come down
 darasal mazra yah he ki jiesti ke vajah se nae saamaanon ke daam kam hue hai or ricycling se bane saamaanon ke daam bad gaya he
 The rate of new goods and recycled salmon has almost come to a close, due to which people are buying new goods and sales of recycled goods have come down
 agar ricycling se bana saamaan nahin bik rahaa he to ricycling ke liye jo puraane saamaanon kii istemaal hota tha unki demand kam ho gai he
 If the recycling industry has reduced inventories, then contractors have also reduced collection of goods from junk, which has led to junkies having to deposit their goods and sell them for less money
 aap yah kah sakate hai ki jab demand kam ho gai he to daam kam ho gaye hai

 # dance # bollywoodparksdubai # dubaidairies # 10thmasalaawardsa post shared by Ankita Lokhande (@lokhandeankita) on Dec 11, 2017 at 12:32pm PST Vani Kapoor started her career in the year 2013 with the film Shuddh Desi Romance
 is film ke baad ve saal 2016 main befrica or saal 2019 main war film main najar ai hai
 His second film Befikre was a box office hit, though the next film War proved to be the biggest blockbuster of the year
 iske alaava vaani ke paas ranbir kapur ke saath ek project bhi he
 The name of this film is Shamshera and there is a lot of buzz in Bollywood about this film
 haal hi menvanine apane kariyar ke bare main baat kii
 He has done only three films in Bollywood in six years which has proved to be an average, a flop and a blockbuster

 The footage from the local TV channel showed that the President's aircraft Airforce One when around 4 at local time
 50 baje shanon hawaondde par pahunchaa
 So at the airport, Prime Minister of Ireland Leo Varadkar welcomed him and his wife Melania Trump
 What an honor to welcome @realddonaldtrump and@flotusto Ireland! The President always speaks fondly of this country and i know he will be given a great Fáilte here over the next few days! 🇺🇸🇮🇪 # trumpinirelandpic

 Let us tell you that earlier the visit of the US President was also opposed in London
 vahaan logon ne trump baby baloon lagaakar donald trump kaa virodh kiya tha
 It was a full afternoon, the head of the sun went havoc
 koi chaataa liye, to koi sir par kapadaa daale hue
 Everyone has come to prepare according to the heat from the humid heat
 barrackpore main bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh kii sabha main jute logon main sirf modi ke naam par utsaah he
 bjp's flag is seen flying
 deevaaron par hindi main lage chunavi ishtahaar ishaara kar rahe hai ki is ilaake main hindi-urdu bhashiyon kaa jor he
 About 40 percent of the voters are Muslim
 badi sankhya main bihar-jharkhand se aae log bhi based hai
 People have an eagerness towards BJP
 modi ke naam kaa aakarshan unhen is chilchilaati dhoop main bhi rajnath singh kii sabhaaon main khinch rahaa he
 But will BJP get seats? Almost everyone has the same answer on this question - BJP is only in a position to win a few seats
 haalanki khud bijepi netaaon kaa daawa he ki darjeeling ke alaava bijepi is baar star ummidavaaron ke boote kuch anya chunaav kshetron main bhi baaji maar sakati he
 Particularly, Babul Supriyo, Bappi Lahiri and George Baker are party hopes
 bijepi ko lagata he modi kaa naam or in sitaron kii chamak shaayad use phayda pahunchayegaa
 But Mamta's magic is going on in Bengal
 parivartan ke naam par left partiyon ko daravaaza dikhaakar sarkaar banane vaali mamata ke teen saal ke kaam kaaj par chaahe alag-alag baaten ho rahi hon
 But there is no evidence now that people's attachment to Mamta has started dissolving
 mamata bengal ke vikaas ke naam par chunaav lard rahi hai
 By calling Modi a 'butcher of Gujarat', his party has made itself stand in front of the BJP
 bangladeshi ghuspaithiyon ko khadedane ke narendra modi ke bayaan ko mamata banerjee kii party ne oochaal diya he
 Rajnath Singh clarifies Modi's statement in his speeches
 kehete hai unka matlab avaidh rup se ghus aae bangladeshiyon ke bare main tha
 Rajnath also tries to pour water on the heat of statements made between BJP and Trinamool
 unka kahana he ki agar dilli main modi sarkaar ai, to pashchim bengal ko vishesh package dene ke liye kaam shuru kiya jayega
 This is an important demand of Mamta Banerjee
 lekin rajya ke vikaas ke liye kadam na uthaane ke liye rajnath mamata par bhi nishaanaa sadhate hai
 The BJP also has a dilemma regarding Mamata
 isse pehle mamata banerjee atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar main mantri bhi rah chuki hai
 Mamta was also instrumental in the completion of her tenure of that government
 16 may ke nateezon main agar endie bahumat se dur rahata he, to use jayalalita, mamata or naveen patnayak se samarthan kii zarurat pad sakati he
 Assembly elections are due in West Bengal in 2016 and in such a situation it is unlikely that Mamata will openly join Modi
 lekin vishesh package ke naam par unase sharton ke aadhaar par samarthan lene kaa vikalp khulaa rakhaa ja saktaa he
 By the way, there is a contest among four parties in Bengal
 trinmul or left paramparaagat virdohi hai
 Congress and BJP too have been killing on their behalf
 lekin modi ke abhiyaan or bijepi par trinmul ke lagaataar hamalon se aisa abhas diya ja rahaa he ki jaise muqabla bijepi or trinmul ke bich hi ho rahaa he
 While in reality this is not so
 yah zarur he ki 2011 kii haar se left front abhi tak ubar nahin paaya he
 Nor do people have any desire to vote for him in this Lok Sabha election
 lekin is chunaav ko trinmul banaam bijepi kaa muqabla bananaa donon hi partiyon ke liye anukool he
 The BJP feels that those who have been against Mamata in the last three years can vote for her instead of the Left
 isiilie narendra modi ke bhaashanon main bhi left ke bajaae mamata par hi tikhaa nishaanaa he
 a BJP leader even goes on to say that the situation which was left in Bengal is of Mamta today
 or jo mamata kii thi, vah bijepi kii he
 Whereas attacking Modi and BJP helps Mamta to take her Muslim voters along
 left ke saath-saath vah congress or bijepi par bhi hamalaa kar ye sandesh detii hai ki vah use zyada gambhirtha se nahin le raheen
 Leaders of the left parties call it a noura-wrestling between the BJP and the Trinamool
 vaise is baat par kai log sahamat hai ki bijepi is chunaav main pashchim bengal main zyaada siten chaahe na jeet paae, lekin uske vot pratishat main modi ke naam par zabardast izapha hoga
 At the time of Ram Janmabhoomi movement, BJP got 12 percent votes in the state
 is baar yah aankada nishchit rup se paar hoga
 The bjp's organization in the state is weak
 yahaan ke marwari-gujarati tabake main party ko samarthan he
 This time Modi's magic is seen among people from other states
 bijepi netaa bengal ke logon ko yaad dilaate hai ki jansangh kii sthapana bengal ke hi shyama prasad mukherjee ne kii thi
 Despite this, Modi has a long way to go to become an alternative to Dada and Didi in Bengal

 jahaan mining bill ke zariye sarkaar baksite or aayran ore jaise khanijon kii nilaamee kaa rasta kholane kii baat kar rahi he vahiin uskaa kahana he ki koyala bill paas ho jane se kol blox nilaamee aasaan hogi

 congress party main sonia gandhi ab kaman rahul gandhi ko saunp chuki hai, khud rahul bhi party ke har ahm maukey par lead karte dikh rahe hai, sonia har jagah nepathy main ja chuki hai
 Now just waiting for the formal announcement of Rahul's coronation, but another person from the Gandhi family has played a big role in the transfer of responsibilities from Sonia to Rahul, which Congress workers fondly call 'bhaiyya ji' 
 darasal, bhaiyya ji congress kaaryakarta priyanka gandhi ko pukaarte hai, jabaki netaa aapas main priyanka ko 'piji' niknem se bulaate hai
 PG, which has been confined in Amethi and Rae Bareli for a long time, has now become active at the national level, the curtain is yet to come out, otherwise from demonetisation to joining the party of leaders or election strategy, PG of Congressmen is now playing an important role everywhere Are in khud congressi kehete hai bas unka kisi pad par naam nahin he or wo khud saamne nahin dikhti varanaa wo sab kar raheen hai jo rahul ke ahm sipahasaalar ko karnaa chahie
 Priyanka, working behind the scenes, was actively involved in demonetisation and when Rahul was busy in rallies and demonstrations across the country, Priyanka Gandhi was the only one behind the scenes
 wo lagaataar ahamed patel, mallikarjun khadge, ghulaam nabi azaad or auskar furnandis sareekhe netaaon ke saath baithken karke rahul ke liye ranneeti taiyaar karti raheen
 Priyanka herself would meet big leaders and then later big leaders including Rahul would brief the remaining leaders
 haal main congress ne 5 janvari ko notebandi ke khilaaf deshbhar main bada protest karne kaa elaan kiya, lekin jab wo sahmati ke liye priyanka ke paas gaya to priyanka ne uski taarikh badal kar ek din aage badha di, kyonki 5 taarikh ko sikhon kaa ahm kaarykram tha
 While the Congress-appointed committee on demonetisation is headed by chairman Ahmed Patel and chairman Oscar Fernandez, the signing of a decision is made by Ahmed Patel, but before that the final approval is done by Priyanka
 kaha ja saktaa he ki, party ke liye bhai rahul siyasat ke field work main jute hai, tobahan priyanka band kamare main partyor bhai ke liye chanakya kii tarah ranneeti ko anjaam de raheen hai
 How did the pair of Congress in the Congress have been very active in the Congress before this, there was Indira during Nehru's era, Sanjay first in Indira's era and later Rajiv, Arun Nehru in Rajiv's era, Rahul in Sonia's era
 Arrived and now Priyanka is increasing her footing during Rahul's era
 vaise hameshaa sage rishton kii jodi hi gandhi parivaar main rahi, lekin rajeev gandhi ke vaqt thoda alag tha, jab nazadiiki rishtedaar arun nehru rahe or baad main arun khud rajeev ke khilaaf ho gaye
 Priyanka had campaigned for Satish Sharma in Rae Bareli in 1999 against the same Arun Nehru and said that would you vote for the man who touched my father's back and Arun Nehru lost the election
 kya rahul par baari padegaa priyanka kaa jaadoois nae prayog se party ko lagata he ki ek phayda bhi he, jo congress ke netaa sonia ke saath confort mahasoos karte rahe, lekin rahul ke saath unki chemistry nahin baith paayi, wo vaaya priyanka party main apni bhoomika hasil karke sakriy ho rahe hai, jiskaa phayda hi party ko hoga
 But in the event of the creation of two power centers, the party will benefit or loss, it is in the pit of the future itself
 aakhir priyanka kyon parade ke baahar nahin aa raheen, iske peeche party ke netaaon kaa tabaka maanata he kipriyanka kaa karishma rahulki chamak par baari pad jaayegaa
 That is why she first wants to establish Rahul as the number one leader of the party, only wants to be in the role of her ally, after that she will be openly active herself when the right time comes, but Priyanka and Gandhi themselves decide The family will take
