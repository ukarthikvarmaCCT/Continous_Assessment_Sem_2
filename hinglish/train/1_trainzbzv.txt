 The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) made it clear on Sunday after the conclusion of its two-day executive and general council meeting that it would not nominate party representatives for the two vacant seats in the Union cabinet
 party ne yah bhi kaha ki congress ke saath uskaa gathbandhan jari rahegaa
 After the end of the two-day executive and general council meeting of the party, Karunanidhi told journalists that the party would not name its members for the two seats vacated by resignation and the status quo would be maintained

 With the resignation of Raja and former textile minister Dayanidhi Maran, no one discussed the issue of sending DMK representatives for vacant posts in the Union Cabinet

 Similarly, the party felt prickled over the issue of Karunanidhi's successor

 In one of the resolutions passed in the General Council, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was criticized for opposing the bail of Karunanidhi's daughter and DMK MP Kanimozhi
 kanimoi 2ji spectrum ghotaale ke sah-shadyantrkaari ke rup main tihaad jail main band hai
 Accusing the CBI of adopting a biased attitude against Kanimozhi, the DMK said that keeping him in jail for a long time is against the principle of natural justice
 ek anya prastaav main ummid jataai gai ki raja or maaran donon bedaag sabit hokar jail se baahar aaenge
 On the Sri Lankan Tamils issue, the DMK said that a referendum should be held to give the Tamils equal rights and the Indian government should take steps to bring war criminals to justice
 party ne centre sarkaar kaa aahvaan kiya ki vah sethu nahar pariyojna ko jald lagu kare
 Regarding the proposed Lokpal Bill, the party said that the post of Prime Minister should be brought under the purview of the Prevention of Corruption Act

 a party source said that several leaders protested against continuing the alliance with the Congress, but senior leader Durai Murugan said that the speakers were getting emotional on the issue
 murugan ne kaha ki gathbandhan kaa nirnay ranneetik mudda he, na ki bhaavnaatmak mudda
 The DMK also decided to constitute a seven-member committee to redesign the party organization

 iraq ke mosul main chaar saal pehle laapata hue 39 bharatiyon kii iesas ne hatya kar di he
 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has given this information in Rajya Sabha
 sushamaa ne bataaya ki sabhi bharatiyon kaa shav baghdad bhej diya gaya tha
 We have tested them through DNA samples
 inamen se 38 ke diene match kar gaye hai, 39wein kii jaanch chal rahi he
 In the last four years, how many times the search operation was conducted for these 39 Indians, but they were never found
 iske liye ajtak ne bhi apni team mosul bheji thi
 At that time it was decided after all our investigation that all Indians had been killed
 bas unki jaankaree ke liye aakhri bharosa bachaa tha, to sirf diene sample kaa
 On October 22 last year, we came to know that Minister of State for External Affairs General VK Singh was going to Iraq to search for 39 missing Hindustanis
 23 aktubar kii raat hi hamaare varisht samvaadadaata shams taahir khan apane sahyogi gaurav saavant or cameraman kripal singh ke saath dilli se baghdad ke liye nikal pade
 There is no direct flight from India to Baghdad
 lihaaja hamaari team pehle dilli se dubai pahunchi
 After this, after catching another flight from Dubai, on the evening of 23 October, our team reached Baghdad Airport at exactly half past five in the local time
 hamaari team ko baghdad ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin thi
 Our team did not even know where they would go and how they would stay
 It was past eight in the night
 iske baad do taxi badal kar baghdad ke karada ilaaka pahunche
 Someone told our team at the airport that the place is fine and the hotel will be easily found there
 raat kareeb das baje hamaari team ne karada outer ke life pales hotel main check in kiya
 The next morning, our team reached the Indian Embassy in Baghdad
 yaheen wike singh se milanaa tha
 Aaj Tak's team knew that we would have to go to Mosul, Badush and Irbil to search for 39 Indians
 ye teenon hi jagah behad khatarnaak thim
 There were now skirmishes against Iraqi forces, Kurdish, rebels and ISIS
 dopaher hote-hote hamaari team ko pataa chalaa ki videsh rajya mantri baghdad pahunch chuke hai
 They are staying in the Green Zone area of baghdad
 green jone ilaaka matlab baghdad kaa sabase mahfuj ilaaka
 In the Indian Embassy itself, our team met with General VK Singh
 unhone hamaari team ko apane plan ke bare main bataaya
 Our team was confident that they would go to Mosul with the Minister of State for External Affairs
 baghdad se mosul tak kareeb 410 kilometre kaa safar sadak ke raste tay karnaa behad khatarnaak tha
 Our team Mosul could only go with the convoy of General VK Singh under the protection of Iraqi forces
 lekin ain vakt par hamen pataa chalaa ki general wike singh iraqi sena ke vishesh vimaan se mosul ravaanaa ho gaye
 The news of his departure to Mosul alone was a shock to our team
 unhen samaj nahin aa rahaa tha ab kya karen? kaise mosul pahunche?harek ne hamaari team ko samajhaayaa ki sadak ke raste mosul jane kaa iraadaa chhod do
 There is a lot of danger
 par doosraa koi rasta bhi nahin tha vahaan tak pahunchane kaa
 And we had to reach Mosul in any case
 isse pehle hamaari team ko baghdad pahunchane ke duusare hi din ye bataaya gaya ki khabar fail chuki he ki hind ke teen sahaafee yani bharat ke teen jarnlist yahaan gum rahe hai
 This news was bad for us
 kyonki hame bataaya gaya tha ki baghdad main beshak iesas kaa asar utana nahin he
 But their sleeper cells are still hidden here
 hamen salaah di gai ki fouran hotel badal lo
 So our team changed its hotel in the night and decided to leave Baghdad in the morning and go to Mosul
 agali subah taxi badal-badal kar hamaari baghdad se mosul ke safar par nikal padi
 The team did not know whether they would be able to reach their destination or not
 raste main har thodi duuri par sena or police ke check post the
 The driver was constantly warning our team to hide the camera
 yahaan tak ki mobile se bhi kuch shoot naa karen
 Tazi was fine until Balad, but after that as soon as our team moved forward, the signs of ruin were clearly visible at the hands of Baghdadi
 ajtak kii team un ilaakon se gujri, jahaan dahesh yani iesas kii maujuudagi ab bhi he
 The team was moving closer to Mosul via Dijail, Rafia and Samara
 driver ne bataaya ki vah taxi sirf din main hi chalaaegaa
 The evening journey was risky
 isliye shaam hone se pehle hi team kisi mahfuj jagah par ruk jaati
 The journey would start again in the morning
 tamaam dar or dehshat ke bich ab tak kaa safar thik thaak tha
 But after this, for the first time our team realized what dangerous journey they were on
 interprator ne bataaya ki daaish ne kuch makaanon ko dhamaake se uda diya he
 Explosion marks and ruins of ruin still exist there
 hamane fouran faisla kiya ki ham un khadnharon ko shoot karenge
 So we took the car off the highway on the raw road and then walked on foot and this was our biggest mistake till date
 ek sunsaan gaanv jaisaa ilaaka jahaan dur-dur tak koi nahin dikh rahaa tha
 Suddenly five-six people were seen
 ajtak kii team ne sochaa ki inase baat kii jaae
 The interpreter had said that unless he says we will not shoot any ruins or man with a camera or mobile
 lihaaja pehle ham unke kareeb gaye
 After this, our interpreter told them in Arabic language that we are Hindi Sahafi i
e
 Indian journalists and that was the only mistake
 iske baad unamem se do logon ne hamaari team kaa camera or mike chin liya
 Then one of them gestured to our team and asked him to walk aside
 arabi main wo baar-baar jhaadiyon kii taraf ishaara kar shaayad dakhul-dakhul bol rahaa tha
 That is, i was asking to enter there
 team ko nahin maaloom tha ki wo log koun the
 Our team was caught in shia-sunni quarrels - were these Daish supporters or angry locals or someone else? Our team did not know anything
 par shaayad hamaari team kaa naseeb acha tha, kyonki thik usee vakt dur se siren kii aawaaj sunai di
 Because of the nervousness, at first we thought that Ajan has a voice
 magar phir dur gasht par iraqi fouj kii do-teen gaadiyaan aati dikhaai deen
 On seeing them, those five six people suddenly ran away throwing our team's camera and mic
 ab hamaari team ko laga ki ve mahfuj hai
 But it took them more than half an hour to recover
 is haadase ne ham teenon par aisa asar kiya ki bas faisla kar liya ki ab ham or aage nahin jaaenge
 The bus is to return to Delhi
 magar shaayad abhi bahut kuch or hona tha
 After leaving from there we found some Iraqi Special Forces personnel at a check post
 unamem se ek ko jab pataa chalaa ki ham bharat se hai to wo bahut khush hua
 Actually he was crazy about Bollywood movies and a big fan of Amitabh Bachchan
 wo hamen apane general ke paas le gaya
 We told the general our motive
 iske baad ab hamaari team iraqi forcej ke saath the
 For the first time since coming to Iraq, he felt safe
 wo hamaari team ko apane saath bagdadi ke haathon barbaad ilaake ko dikhaane apane saath le jane par raji ho gaye
 The danger still persisted in those areas
 par ab ve unke saath the
 After a while our team was in the area where Daish had exploded
 har taraf tabaahi or barbaadi ke hi manjar the
 Iraqi Forces told our team that the danger in this area is still not averted
 par ve hamaari team ko baar-baar yakeen dilaa rahe the ki unke saath ve mahfuj hai
 There were check posts inside the village, in which the Iraqi force was stationed
 phir vahaan ke logon se hamaari team ko milaayaa gaya
 Who told the story of the terror of Baghdadi
 iraqi sena ke saath gaanv kaa daura karne ke baad ve waapas check post pahunche
 He fed our team with his jawans and sent us off with the intention not to go further
 yani mosul kii taraf naa jaaen
 But by now our team had recovered and the passion to go to Mosul again was overpowered
 so ham aage bade
 Now the driver of our team was also an interpreter
 par use angreji nahin aati thi
 Our team led the way
 mobile par google translator ke jariye apni baat angreji se arabi main bataai or driver arabi se angreji main hamaari team ko bataata rahaa, lekin wo driver is baat par raji nahin tha ki hamaari team mosul jaae
 He told us to translate on mobile
 hamaari team jaise-jaise mosul ke kareeb ja rahi thi, unki bechaini badhati ja rahi thi
 We were constantly listening to the story of Mosul and its ruin
 ah wo hamaare behad kareeb tha
 But then we came to know that firing has started again in Mosul between Kurdish fighter, rebel and Iraqi forces for two days
 par ham phir bhi aage badhate rahe
 We were told that Baghdadi gunpowder could be found on the way
 isliye sanbhal kar janaa hoga
 Finally that moment came when our team was in front of the city of Mosul
 mosul yani baghdad ke baad iraq kaa doosraa sabase bada shahar
 Mosul is the city that gave the world muslin cloth for the first time
 usee malamal kii vajah se mosul naam padaa
 The manger of the city was shouting and saying that this is not a city of humans but a city of ghosts
 ghar khandhar or khandhar gharon main tabdeel the
 It seemed as if the bomb had been dropped all over the city
 jahaan bam apana kaam nahin kar paaya vahaan goliyon ke nishaan daro-diwaar par cheekh rahe the
 There was no such thing as a human being
 jo the bas khamosh the
 Or there were dense settlements
 vahaan tak hamen jane kii ijaajat nahin thi or naa hi wo sahi faisla bhi hota
 Because in the guise of which person, which enemies did not come out
 yaa koun sa kadam jameen main chupe barood ke kis dher par pad jaae nahin pataa
 The city of Mosul was previously a very pleasant and vibrant city
 jise lafzon main bayaan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 But after 10 June 2014 the story changed
 mosul main achaanak bagdadi or uske aatanki aae
 They destroyed the city in three years with bombs, guns and ammo
 ab dur-dur tak tuuti padi imaaraten, khandhiron main tabdeel makaan, barbaad sadaken, jagah-jagah malbe ke dher or fijaa main bikhri barood kii baichaiyn karne vaali bu hi yahaan maujuud he
 This is what is achieved against isis's three-year campaign
 mosul kii jamini hakeekat or tasviren hamaari team ke saamne thim
 But the answer to that question was not yet found, for which our team went from India to there
 mosul main 39 bharatiyon kii talash thi
 His clue was to be found
 lekin ye kaam itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 Because most people here did not know anything about those missing Indians
 rahi iraqi sena or intelligence kii baat to unke paas koi pukhta saboot yaa phir jaankaree kii kami thi
 But we still had to try
 lihaaza iske baad hamaari team phir se 39 laapata bharatiyon kii talash main jute gai
 Indeed, the missing Indians were last seen in the Badush area of mosul
 par kis jagah kisi ko nahin pataa tha
 Therefore, the Minister of State for External Affairs also reached here in search of him
 unhone baqayada ek ratamosulake andar guzari
 After talking to people and Italians, it was known that the truth is that no one has any concrete information about those missing Indians

 The Kedarnath tragedy has been a year today
 is traasadee kii pehali barsi par wo bhayanak yaaden phir taaja ho gai hai jinhone puure desh ko jhakazorkar rakh diya tha
 Tragedy passed, leaving all painful memories
 in sabake bich ab ek baar phir kedarnath main vyavastha patari par laane kii koshish jari he
 Life ends with tragedies, but there is no break
 kedarnath dham main jivan ek baar phir aasthaa ke path par bad chalaa he
 The valley is buzzing with mantras
 mahadev kii nagari main pasre sannaate ko shanti kii talash main aae log apane bhakthi geeton se tod rahe hai
 Photos: Water ordeal in Uttarakhand, Kedarnath Dham was devastated
 On the night of 16 June 2013, gharials, conch shells and slokas were echoed for the last time in Kedarnath
 iske baad pralankar kii nagari main jal pralay aa gai
 This deluge changed the face of the Kedar valley
 shahar ko viraani or maut kii chadar ne dhank liya
 Salvation in Kedarnath, only Kedarnath temple
 naa hotel bache naa dharmashala, naa jindagi bachi or naa hi kudarat kii khubsuurati
 Thousands of people were absorbed in the water flow
 jalpralay kii dhara itani tej thi ki puure kedarnath dham main uske bahane ke nishaan saikadon feet upar se bhi saaf najar aate the
 The trend of the Mandakini river flowing in the neighborhood of Kedarnath changed
 puure uttarakhand kii nadiyaan kinare todakar bahane lageen
 Dev and Mahadev were also swept away in the fierce flow of the rivers of Devbhoomi
 puraa uttarakhand khand khand ho gaya
 The mountains slipped, the roads slipped
 har ore jal pralay kaa kolahal tha, nadiyon kaa prachand veg tha, ufanti dharaaen thim, maut kii chitkaar thi or har maathe par chintaa kii lakeeren thim
 Human settlements were found in the rivers of Uttarakhand, but those who know the nature say that the rivers that flowed slowly for years had gathered to get their land
 tasveeron main dekhen kedarnath kii tabaahi kaa manjarsaal bhar baad bhi jari he nirmaan kaa kaaryis saal 3 may ko kedarnath ke kapaat khol die gaye
 The work of repairing roads for the movement of passengers in Devbhoomi has been going on for a year
 kedarnath main nirmaan kaary tabaahi biit jane ke baad se hi jari he
 Work is being done to bring the Mandakini river stream on the old route before the rainy season
 philhal mandakini kii dhara kaa rukh badla hua he jisase mandir ko khatra bana hua he
 One and a half hundred workers of Nim (NIM) are working
 isamen sinchai vibhaag bhi nim kii madad kar rahaa he
 The government is also repairing the ruined roads, but the roads are again being built on the foundation of destruction
 darasal dobaaraa banaai ja rahi sadakon kaa aadhaar bahut kamjor he
 The soil under the roads is friable and there is a possibility of its slipping in light rain
 jis company ko sarkaar ne srinagar se goricund tak sadak banane kaa kaam diya he usne saaf kah diya he kii maujuuda sadak baari barsaat main tikne laayak nahin hai
 Suddenly, the locals are also surprised to see the road of such a long route being built in such a short time
 logo kaa kahana he kii sadak kaa kaam to yuddh str par ho rahaa he lekin jamini hakeekat ye he ki maanakon kii andekhi kar ye sab jaldbaaji main kiya ja rahaa he
 The earlier catastrophe was also the result of human lapses and imprudence
 nadiyon ko baandha phir pahaado ko katkar sadaken khinch di lekin kudarat ko hone vaale nuksaan ko nahin aankane kii nasamajhi kar baithe
 Now again the same lapse is being repeated
 sadaken or buniyadi dhaanche ko majboot banane ke bajaay kamjor buniyaad par vikaas kii imaarat tamir kii ja rahi he

 What is the problem of the Governor of Reserve Bank of India, Urjit Patel, to name the people who have not repaid loans ranging from 50 crores to 1 lakh crores
 bhartiya reserve bank koun hota he unki izzat yaa saakh kii chintaa karne vaala wo bhi jo bank kaa lone nahin chukaa rahe hai
 Does the Reserve Bank also take into account the social dignity of the common farmers
 kya yah acha he ki soochna ayukta reserve bank ke governor ko yaad dilaaein ki daam na milane ke kaaran karzdaar kisaan maut ko gale laga letaa he or aap hai ki bade karzdaaron ke naam tak zaahir nahin karte hai
 On March 14, the Government of India has instructed all banks that the names and other information of those who have taken more than 50 crore loans and have not repaid should be printed in the newspapers
 unhen nem or shem kiya jaae yani sharminda kiya jaae
 Then why is the Reserve Bank not mentioning the name
 disambar 2017 tak ke aankade ke anusaar 9063 bakaayedaaron par kareeb 11 lakh karod rupaya baaki he jise ham enpie kehete hai
 Did the governor ask the government banks, or did the government ask the government banks why even after our order, there is no list of non-lenders on your website

 aapke maatahat soochna adhikari ko dandit karne kaa koi matlab nahin kyonki reserve bank ke pradhan soochna adhikari governor hi hote hai
 The Information Commissioner has reprimanded by reminding one thing of Governor Urjit Patel
 20 sitambar ko kendriya satarkta ayog ke ek kaarykram main bolte hue urjit patel ne kaha tha ki satarkta ayog ke dishanirdeshon kaa makasad saarvajanik jivan main paardarshita, eemaandaaree or shuchita kii samskruti ko badhaava dena he
 Then Information Commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu has asked that the Commission believe that there is no commonality between what the Governor and Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank says and what the Right to Information policy on their website says
 satarkta report ko dabaaya ja rahaa he

 The killer is not caught

 On March 14, the Government of India has instructed all banks that the names and other information of those who have taken more than 50 crore loans and have not repaid should be printed in the newspapers
 unhen nem or shem kiya jaae yani sharminda kiya jaae
 Then why is the Reserve Bank not mentioning the name
 disambar 2017 tak ke aankade ke anusaar 9063 bakaayedaaron par kareeb 11 lakh karod rupaya baaki he jise ham enpie kehete hai
 Did the governor ask the government banks, or did the government ask the government banks why even after our order, there is no list of non-lenders on your website

 March to November arrived
 ab hangaamaa he ki kendiy soochna ayukta shridhar acharyulu ne bhartiya reserve bank ke governor ko notice bhej kar 16 november tak jawaab dene ke liye kaha he
 Have asked why the maximum penalty should not be imposed on you for not disclosing the names of the big defaulters
 aapke maatahat soochna adhikari ko dandit karne kaa koi matlab nahin kyonki reserve bank ke pradhan soochna adhikari governor hi hote hai
 The Information Commissioner has reprimanded by reminding one thing of Governor Urjit Patel
 20 sitambar ko kendriya satarkta ayog ke ek kaarykram main bolte hue urjit patel ne kaha tha ki satarkta ayog ke dishanirdeshon kaa makasad saarvajanik jivan main paardarshita, eemaandaaree or shuchita kii samskruti ko badhaava dena he
 Then Information Commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu has asked that the Commission believe that there is no commonality between what the Governor and Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank says and what the Right to Information policy on their website says
 satarkta report ko dabaaya ja rahaa he
 Whereas the Supreme Court has accepted the information commission order as correct
 soochna na dene ke liye soochna adhikari ko dandit karne se kuch nahin hoga kyonki vah to sheersh adhikariyon ke nirdesh par kaam karata he

 This order came when Nirav Modi, Mehul Chauksi went missing after several thousands of loans, ie they fled abroad
 march se november aa gaya
 Now there is an uproar that the Central Information Commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu has sent a notice to the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India asking him to reply by 16 November
 poocha he ki bade difoltaron ke naam na ujagar karne ke kaaran aap par adhiktam jurmaana kyon na lagaaya jaae
 There is no point punishing the information officer under you as the Chief Information Officer of the Reserve Bank is the Governor
 soochna ayukta ne governor urjit patel kii hi ek baat ko yaad dilaate hue fatkaar lagaai he
 Speaking on 20 September at a program of the Central Vigilance Commission, Urjit Patel said that the Vigilance Commission guidelines aim to promote a culture of transparency, honesty and fairness in public life
 tab soochna ayukta shridhar acharyulu ne poocha he ki ayog kaa maananaa he ki reserve bank ke governor or dipti governor jo baat kehete hai or jo unki website par soochna ke adhikaar kii jo niti he, donon main koi samanta nahin he
 The vigilance report is being suppressed
 jabaki supreme court ne soochna ayog ke aadesh ko sahi mana he
 Punishing the information officer for not giving information will do nothing as he acts on the instructions of top officials
 governor hi nahin pradhanmantri karyaalay or vitt mantralay se bhi poocha gaya he ki 4 farvari 2015 ko purv governor raghuram rajan ne aapako jin bakaayedaaron kii list di thi or jinke khilaaf kai agenciyon se jaanch karaane kii baat kahi thi, unke naam saarvajanik kiijie
 You know that on 6 September 2018 Raghuram Rajan wrote all these things in a 17-page note to the Parliament Assessment Committee
 kya pradhanmantri karyaalay raghuram rajan kii di gai suchi ko saarvajanik karegaa, jinamein lone na chukaa kar or dastavezon main herapheri kar lone ke paise ko edjust karne kii baat likhi he
 When the government orders, why are banks not making the names public
 sab nirgun bhav se baat kyon kar rahe hai, report kyon nahin de rahe hai
 So why do such big institutions save these thousands of crores of defaulters, then why do they not save the farmers who commit suicide due to loan of one lakh only
 aapako naam kyon nahin bataaya jaataa he, naam jaanane se kya hoga, yah sawaal bhi khud se poochna chahie
 When you officially know the names of thousands of crores of defaulters, then you will also be able to see how this man is enjoying taking such a big loan, walking around with big leaders
 april maheene main pune ke neshnal institute of banking main bolte hue dipti governor vishvanathan ne kaha tha ki bainkon ke lone kaa sahi moolyankan bainkon ko bhi suut kar rahaa he or sarkaar ko bhi suut kar rahaa he
 And is also suits those who do not repay with a loan
 bank apana bahikhaata saaf suthra kar lete hai or bakaayedaar difolter kaa tag lagane se batch jate hai
 The condition is that no horn is holding, all the fingers are showing that the bull is there
 non parforming asset yani enpie pichley aath saal se lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he
 In the Lok Sabha, there are many statements on the NPA and loan fraud of Shiv Pratap Shukla, Minister of State for Finance
 6 april 2018 ko loksabhaa main bataate hai ki march 2015 main bainkon kaa enpie 2 lakh 67 hazaar karod tha
 The npas of banks increased to 6 lakh 89 thousand crore as on 30 June 2017
 phir ek or bayaan he ki 31 disambar 2017 tak 7 lakh 77 hazaar karod enpie ho gaya
 So you saw that between March 2015 to June 2017, the NPA increased by four lakh crores
 june 2017 se disambar 2017 ke bich ek lakh karod bad gaya
 Looking at it from another angle, from March 2015 to 31 December 2017, the NPA increased to five lakh crores
 ab baat haren pandya hatya maamle kii
 There is talk of Gujarat model
 sakht prashasan kii baat hoti he
 But how did it happen that in 2003, the state Home Minister Haren Pandya is killed and no one is punished even after 15 years
 hatyara nahin pakadaa jaataa he
 In 2011, the Gujarat High Court strongly criticized the investigating agency if the accused in the murder of a home minister is not caught
 tippaniyan Explained at several places how the agency did not conduct the investigation properly
 uske baad bhi sibiai ne nae sire se jaanch nahin kii
 Rather, based on his chargesheet, the Supreme Court went against the 12 accused acquitted from the Gujarat High Court
 supreme court se antim faisla nahin aayaa he
 Now this case has taken a new turn
 kathith rup se soharabuddin tulsiram prajapati encounter cese main mumbai main sunwaayee chal rahi he
 In this case witness No
 207 has said that Sohrabuddin had killed Haren Pandya at the behest of IPS officer DG Vanzara
 haren padya bijepi ke vidhayak the, grahamantri the, gavaah ke is bayaan par kise sakriy hona chahie tha, bijepi ko yaa di vir ko
 Should the BJP not have demanded a fresh inquiry after this statement, ministers should not tweet, Amit Shah had not to give assurances
 par kya kisi ne bolaa he
 Is it a simple statement that the IPS officer got the Home Minister murdered
 gavaah number 207 kaa kahana he ki usne yahi baat 2010 main sibiai ke jaanch adhikari enes raju se bhi kahi thi tab raju ne use chup kara diya
 The witness is also a prosecutor in a case
 di vir ne is hatyakand, isaki jaanch or mukademe kii prakriya par vistaar se likhte hue bataaya he ki haren pandya kii hatya ke pehle unki suraksha hataa lee gai thi
 His body was found the next day
 sibiai maanati he ki pandya kii hatya muslim kattarpanthi ke ishaare par hui
 Mufti Sufis reportedly fled to Pakistan
 2011 main gujarat hai court ne is maamle main 12 aropiyon ko bari kar diya
 The High Court had strongly criticized the investigating agency in its order
 kaha ki jaanch agency ne kaaphi ghalmail kiya he
 The CBI was being investigated by YC Modi, who was made director of NIA in 2017
 20 sitambar ko kendriya satarkta ayog ke ek kaarykram main bolte hue urjit patel ne kaha tha ki satarkta ayog ke dishanirdeshon kaa makasad saarvajanik jivan main paardarshita, eemaandaaree or shuchita kii samskruti ko badhaava dena he
 Then Information Commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu has asked that the Commission believe that there is no commonality between what the Governor and Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank says and what the Right to Information policy on their website says
 satarkta report ko dabaaya ja rahaa he
 Whereas the Supreme Court has accepted the information commission order as correct
 soochna na dene ke liye soochna adhikari ko dandit karne se kuch nahin hoga kyonki vah to sheersh adhikariyon ke nirdesh par kaam karata he
 Not only the Governor, the Prime Minister's Office and the Ministry of Finance have also been asked that on February 4, 2015, the former Governor Raghuram Rajan gave you a list of the defaulters, and against whom several agencies had asked for a probe, make the names of them public
 aap jaanate hai ki 6 sitambar 2018 ko raghuram rajan ne sansad kii aankalan samiti ko 17 pannon ke ek nots main yah sab baaten likhi thim
 Will the Prime Minister's office make public the list given by Raghuram Rajan, which has written about adjusting loan money by not repaying loans and manipulating documents
 jab sarkaar kaa aadesh he bainkon ko tab naam saarvajanik kyon nahin ho rahe hai
 Why are everyone talking with a bad sense, why are they not reporting? to itani badi badi sansthaaen in hazaar karod ke bakaayedaaron ko kyon bachaati hai, to phir ye kisaanon ko kyon nahin bachaati hai jo maatr ek lakh ke lone ke kaaran aatmahatya kar lete hai
 Why you are not told the name, what will happen if you know the name, this question should also be asked yourself
 jab aap hazaron karodon ke baqaayadaaron ke aadhikarik rup se naam jaan jaaenge to aap yah bhi dekh sakenge ki itnaa bada lone lekar kaise yah banda mast he, bade bade netaaon ke saath gum phir rahaa he
 Speaking at Pune's National Institute of Banking in April, Deputy Governor Vishwanathan had said that the correct assessment of banks' loans was also suits the banks and suits the government as well

 The book 'the Accidental Prime Minister' by Sanjay Baru, who was the media advisor to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, has created a panic these days
 baru ne pradhanmantri karyaalay main apane sansmaranon kaa zikr is kitaab main kiya he
 This book, in a way, confirms the bjp's allegations that Manmohan Singh was a very weak prime minister and that the power of power was in the hands of Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 baru is pustak main likhte hai ki manmohan singh ne khud mana tha ki satta ke do centre nahin ho sakate, isiilie unhone saare faisle lene ke adhikaar sonia gandhi ko de die
 The book also claims that many important files were shown to Sonia Gandhi before taking a decision
 haalanki pradhanmantri karyaalay or congress ne baru ke daavon ko khaarij kar diya he
 The Congress says that Baru made these sensational claims in the midst of elections to increase the sales of his book
 isse pehle bhi pradhanmantri ke media salaahkaar rahe patrkaar apane anubhavon ko kitabon ke zarie saamne rakhte rahe hai
 Books by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi's media advisors HY Sharda Prasad and Lal Bahadur Shastri's media advisor Kuldeep Nayyar have also come to light, but perhaps never before
 baru kii pustak main kiye gaye rahasyodghatano ko endie ke pradhanmantri ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne haathon-haath liya he
 She has questioned the silence of Sonia Gandhi, and sought clarification on Baru's claim that she has been watching government files
 siyaasi galiyaaron main baru kii kitaab ko lekar kai tarah kii atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai
 Some people are also saying that through this book Baru has tried to keep Manmohan Singh away from the failures of upa's second term
 abhi tak hota yahi aayaa he ki congress party ne har vivaad kaa thikra manmohan singh ke sir phoda, to vahiin har kamyaabi kaa sehara sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ke sir baandha
 This book of Baru tries to prove that Manmohan Singh has no direct role in all the controversies
 vivaadaaspad netaaon ko mantrimandal main shaamil karne se lekar america ke saath parmaanu qaraar ko lekar congress party or manmohan singh ke bich matbhedon ko bhi is pustak main pramukhataa se uthaaya gaya he
 Interestingly, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh has raised controversy by saying that the use of two centers of power has failed, but Baru's book dismisses this outright
 baru saaf-saaf kehete hai ki satta kaa ek hi centre he or vah he sonia gandhi
 In this way, Sanjay Baru, the former media advisor to the Prime Minister and his close confidant, has already dented the Congress's efforts to hold Manmohan Singh responsible for the possible results of the Lok Sabha elections rather than Rahul gandhi-sonia Gandhi
 baru ke kitaab aise vakt ai he, jab koyala ghotaale kii jaanch kii aanch pradhanmantri karyaalay tak pahunch rahi he
 The CBI has questioned TKA Nair, a former principal secretary in the Prime Minister's Office and currently working as an advisor
 manmohan singh ke karibiyon ko andeshaa he ki agar upie kii satta main vaapasi nahin hoti he, to kahin aisa na ho ki manmohan singh ko bhi is jaanch ke lapete main le liya jaae
 Perhaps this is the reason why this book of Baru underlines the distance of Manmohan Singh from many important and controversial decisions
 inamen 2009 main sarkaar banane par tiaar baaluu or e raja ko mantrimandal main lene ke bare main manmohan singh ke virodh kaa bhi zikr he
 In which it is said that how Baloo was prevented by Manmohan Singh from entering his cabinet, but under pressure from Congress party, A
 Raja had to join the cabinet
 2009 main upie kii satta main vaapasi kaa shrey manmohan singh ko diya gaya tha, lekin upie ke duusare kaarykaal main bhrashtachar, mahangaai, bigadi arth vyavastha kaa thikra manmohan singh ke sir phodne kii taiyaari he
 However, Manmohan Singh says that he is hopeful that history will treat him more sympathetically
 lekin kai mantri khule aam kah chuke hai ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh khul kar apni baat janata tak pahunchane main naakaam rahe hai
 In response, the Prime Minister's Office gave the slogan, 'kam bola, kaam bola'
 pradhanmantri to ab bhi chup hai
 But Sanjay Baru is speaking and his speaking is creating new difficulties for the Congress

 congress main shaamil hone ke baad navjot singh siddhu or captain amarinder singh guuruuvaar ko pehali baar amritsar main ek saath media ke saamne aae
 At the beginning of the press conference, the Congress CM candidate in the Punjab elections told that he has seen Navjot Singh Sidhu very young, that is, he has children and he is the captain here
 
 
 vahiin siddhu ko bhi yah kahana padaa ki baap-baap hota he, betaa-betaa hota he
 However, the style of Navjot Singh Sidhu, who often talks long, was missing in this joint press conference
 is puri press conference ke dauraan siddhu se puche gaye adhiktar sawaalon ko vah taalte rahe or captain hi unki taraf se jawaab de rahe the
 Here one thing was clearly visible to everyone, that Sidhu did not appear in his familiar style in the presence of Captain
 punjab congress ke adhyaksh captlemarinder sinhane haalanki yahaan siddhu kii tarif karte hue kaha ki vah unhen bachapan se jaanate hai
 The Captain also said that Sidhu has joined the Congress unconditionally
 vah ek foot soljar hai
 At the same time, Sidhu also described the captain as his father
 amritsar main yojit is sanyukt samvaadadaata sammelan main zyaadaatar vakt amarinder singh hi bole, jabaki siddhu chup rahe
 One reason for this silence of Sidhu, who recently quit the Congress and joined the Congress, is that his father has also worked with Amarinder Singh and the other is that both of them come from Patiala
 amarinder singh patiala ke raaj parivaar se he or punjab congress ke adhyaksh bhi hai, isliye siddhu kahin se bhi ye nahin chaahate the ki vah captain ko kamatar karte dikhe
 The special thing is that Amarinder Singh has already announced that this is his last election and after this he will not contest
 jabaki navjot singh siddhu congress main apni pari kii shuruyaat kar rahe hai
 The two had their first joint press conference in Amritsar, but Sidhu arrived after Amarinder Singh
 amarinder singh kaa pehle navjot singh siddhu ke saath ek road sho kaa bhi program tha, lekin usko bhi cancil kar diya gaya

 In violation of the circular of the Government, the Indian Air Force has said that information sought under the Right to Information Act will not be given if the amount of application fee is paid to the account officer's account
 ek artiai daalkar unase poocha gaya tha ki yadi soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat maangi gayi jaankaree ke liye raashi kaa bhugtan vayusena ke account afisar ke khate main kiya jaae to kya jaankaree uplabdh karai jaaegi

 baatcheet ke dauraan haal hi main mayawati ke khilaaf kathith rup se abhadra tippanee karne or usase upje vivaad ke vishay main reeta joshi ne khulkar baat kii
 During the entire conversation, Rita Bahuguna strongly cursed the Uttar Pradesh government and Chief Minister Mayawati
 gauratlab he ki pichley dinon mayawati ke khilaaf kathith rup se abhadra tippanee karne ke aarope main reeta joshi ko jail kii hawa khaani padi thi
 Since then, there was a bit of earthquake in the politics of Uttar Pradesh
 reeta ne kaha ki mayawati kii sarkaar puri tarah se bhrasht or mafiavaadi he
 He alleged that Mayawati is contesting elections on her party ticket by expelling mafias from jail
 mayawati dwaara rajya kii rajdhani lakhanu or noida main karaae ja rahe parkon ke nirmaan par sawaal uthaate hue reeta bahuguna ne kaha ki mayawati ke man main asuraksha kii bhaavana he
 Therefore, she wants to divert the attention of the people from original subjects and issues by constructing beautiful parks
 jab unase poocha gaya ki mayawati kaa kahana he ki jab mahatma gandhi or nehru parivaar ke logon ke naam se smarak ban sakate hai to unke naam se kyon nahin, is par reeta ne kaha ki bharat main gandhi ji ke saath kisi kii bhi tulana karnaa galat he
 He accused Mayawati that parks are being built by misusing the money to build roads or in the name of cultural development
 reeta ne yah bhi kaha ki jin puraane mahapurushon ke naam se smarak bane hai unhone khud apane liye naa to koi smarak banwaaya tha or naa hi jite ji apni murti kahin sthapit karwaai thi
 He also said that Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar's statue gives a message because the book depicts the book in one hand of his idol, but no message from the statue of Mayawati
 unhone kaha ki kanshiram ne ek mishan ke saath bahujan samaaj party kii sthapana kii thi lekin unhone apane mishan ko aage badhaane ke liye galat aadmi kaa chunaav kar liya
 Rita's gesture was towards Mayawati
 unhone kaha ki mayawati har kshetra main vifal ho gai hai
 On the recent controversy with Mayawati, she said that the dispute was raised by Mayawati because i did not make any commentary, but i do not believe in casteism
 reeta ne sweekaar kiya ki unki jubaan galat thi lekin niyat saaf thi
 He also said that he had also apologized for his wrong words
 reeta ne bahanji par bahanon ke liye kuch nahin karne kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 Describing the Uttar Pradesh government as irresponsible, Rita Bahuguna said that Mayawati is no less than a dictator and if anyone criticizes her, she starts treating her as her enemy
 unhone mayawati ko uttar pradesh kii sabase kharaab mukhyamantri bhi qaraar diya

 ' baliya loksabhaa seat kii pahchaan shuru se hi purv pradhanmantri chandrashekhar ke naam par rahi he
 His younger son Neeraj Shekhar contested the by-elections and further Lok Sabha elections after his death, except 84, as long as he remained alive
 is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main sapa- basapa kaa gathbandhan hua or yah seat sapa ke khate main ai
 Everyone was expecting and assuming that SP will field Neeraj Shekhar from this seat, but just hours before the last day of nomination, SP surprised everyone by replacing former MLA from Neeraj Shekhar
 Sanatan Pandey was made his candidate
 is elaan ke saath hi yah tay ho gaya ki baliya main is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main purv pradhanmantri chandrashekhar ke parivaar kaa koi sadsy nahin hoga
 It will happen after 42 years when Chandrashekhar or no member of his family will be in the election field in Ballia Lok Sabha seat
 bhartiya raajnneeti main yuva turk ke naam se mashhoor chandrashekhar kaa baliya main lambey samay tak raaj rahaa
 In 37 years, he contested 9 elections from Ballia and once in 1984 he lost in a sympathy wave after the assassination of Indira Gandhi
 yahi ek chunaav tha jab vah baliya se haare, iske alaava vah kabhi chunaav nahin haare
 This time, even though Chandrasekhar or no member of his family is in the fray, Chandrasekhar and his family are still at the center of the discussion
 baliya kii janata ke bich chunavi charchaa voting se pehle bhi yahi he ki niraj shekhar ko tikat milanaa chahie tha
 If Neeraj Shekhar, should he have given the ticket to his wife
 niraj shekhar ke nahin ladane se kisko phayda hoga
 Also, there is a lot of discussion that Neeraj Shekhar should not merge his father's party Sajpa with SP
 yani chunavi charchaa main bhi ab bhi chandrashekhar va unka parivaar hi he
 BJP Candidate Virendra Singh "mast" Neeraj Shekhar not contesting in the election, the BJP seems to benefit from it somewhere
 bhadohi ke saansad or kisaan morcha ke adhyaksh virendra singh mast is baar bijepi ke tikat par baliya se chunaav lard rahe hai
 The name of Virendra Singh Mast was not discussed with Ballia, but the ticket of Bharatiya's sitting MP Bharat Singh was cut after giving him the ticket
 tikat ke elaan ke saath hi mana jane laga ki sapa yahaan majboot ho gai
 Virender Singh Mast had contested from Ballia once before and had to face a crushing defeat
 virendra singh mast kii sthiti kamjor maani ja rahi thi lekin jaise hi niraj shekhar kaa baliya se tikat kataa usee samay se yah mana jane laga ki virendra singh kii raah ab aasaan ho gai
 This is the strategy of the SP
 The sp's strategy for this seat is being considered that Rajput and Bhumihar voters can support the BJP candidate, in such a way, it can help the Brahmin voters through Sanatan Pandey
 saath hi yadav, muslim or daliton kaa vot use mil jaae to sapa kii raah is seat se aasaan ho sakati he
 It will be a matter of how much Brahmin voters can associate with SP

 The Congress won the last election in 1984 from this seat

 molding of relif par bhi kal hi sunwaayee ho sakati he
 On Tuesday, when the lawyer of Ramlala Virajman, Vaidyanathan was making his arguments in the Supreme Court, then the lawyer of the Muslim side, Rajiv Dhawan, interrupted him several times
 isko lekar vaidyanathan ke aapatti jataane par supreme court ke chif justise ne kaha ki court main bahason ke dauraan aisa hota he
 Later, when Dhawan again interrupted, the CJI strongly reprimanded him
 is par dhawan ne maafee maangi
 After the hearing began on Tuesday, the lawyer for the Muslim side, Rajiv Dhawan told the court that the mother of Sushil Jain, lawyer of Nirmohi Akhara, has passed away
 aise main aaj susheel jain bahes nahin kar paaenge, vah kal bahes karenge
 The court allowed this
 iske baad supreme court ne varisht vakil ke paraasaran se poocha aap kiski taraf se bahes karenge? to paraasaran ne kaha ki mahant suresh das kii taraf se
 Hindu side

 - Vaidyanathan said that this building was being used as a mosque and not as a mosque
 justise bobade ne kaha- samarpan to nishkarsh chiz he, kya use saboot mana ja saktaa he? vaidyanathan ne kaha- ye baat to justise khan ne bhi kahi he ki jab kisi sampatti ke do daavedaar or istemaal karne vaale hon to use vaqf nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Therefore there was no specific surrender
 justise bobade ne kaha- lekin wo masjid ke taur par istemaal to ho rahi thi? vaidyanathan ne kaha- haa, lekin unke paas pajeshan ke adhikaar kaa koi saboot nahin he
 Meanwhile, once again Rajiv Dhawan objected, then the Chief Justice rebuked Dhawan badly and asked him to sit down
 dhawan maafee maangate hue baith gaye
 On Dhawan's talkataki, Vaidyanathan said that Dhawan is needlessly interfering
 dhawan ne kaha ki aap bhi to meri bahes ke dauraan tok rahe the
 Vaidyanathan said - in this way they cannot argue between running commentary
 court ne dekha he ki dhawan kaaphi dakhlandaji kar rahe hai
 This is not fair
 - dhawan cheekhte hue bole- stop it, just stop it! isse naaraaz vaidyanathan ne aapatti jataate hue kaha- court kaa sammaan karata hum par aise maahaul main main bahes nahin kar saktaa
 To this, the CJI said that this happens during the debate in Mr
 Vaidyanathan Court
 kabhi aap ye sab karte hai kabhi wo, to kabhi ham
 This is normal
 aap bahes jari rakhen
 The hearing resumed after a 15-minute tea break
 paraasaran ke baad ab hindu pakshakaron kii ore se sies vaidyanathan daleelein de rahe hai
 He said that the Sunni Waqf Board had lost possession from 1949 to 1992
 grant, vaqf or edwars pajeshan ko muslim pakshakaron ne apil kaa aadhaar banaaya he
 These are all about the structure
 zamin par adhikaar hamaara hi he
 Rajiv Dhawan shouted at Vaidyanathan's plea and said- 'just stop it
 ' is tarah kii aapatti par vaidyanathan naaraaz hue or kaha ki inako ye haq nahin he
 i respect and oppose the court
 -CJI ne kaha ki agar hamen aapaki daleel par aapatti hogi to ham kahenge
 You ignore his words
 aap daleel jari rakhen
 In the Ayodhya Ram Janmabhoomi case, CJI Justice Ranjan Gogoi asked the lawyer of the Hindu side, CS Lawanathan, how much time do you want? CS Vaidyanathan said that he needed two hours to argue
 court ne kaha ki ham aapako do ghante nahi denge bahes karne ke liye
 4 by CJI
 15 se 5
 Asked to complete the debate by 15
 sies vaidhanathan ne kaha ki aap hamen kal kaa 60 minute de dijie bahes ke liye
 The CJI said that we have seen many such promises
 CJI ne naaraazgi jaahir karte hue karte hue kaha aise to bahes diwaali ke baad bhi chalati rahegi
 Lawyer of the Hindu side, Lawanathan said that we have never broken the promise
 -hindu paksh kii ore se paraasaran ne daleel jari rakhte hue kaha ki donon pakshon ke paas exclusive malikana haq ke saboot nahin hai lekin ramajnmabhumi ati pracheen hone se is par hamaara adhikaar he
 The land of our Devasthan is ours, but the Muslim side has been asserting authority over the building
 jahaan tak babar ke ayodhya aane par sawaal uthaane kaa he to hamaara jawaab he ki is baat ke pusht pramaan hai ki babar ayodhya aayaa tha
 - Justice Nazeer asked the Hindu side that without proving the possession possession can prove the ownership
 Parasaran said that because the provision of dual ownership is in Indian law
 lihaaza edwars pajeshan main bhi kisi kii jameen par koi jabaran imaarat bana le to bhi jameen kaa malikana haq zamin vaale kaa hi rahata he
 We still need to prove the ownership of the Muslim side but not us
 kyonki hamaara daawa to swayansiddh he
 - CJI said that - 'dr
 Dhawan, see we are asking questions from the Hindu side too!' - Chief Justice, Justice Bobade and Justice Chandchud, among the arguments of lawyer Parasaran of Hindu side during the hearing of Darsal today case Ask questions - chif justise ranjan gogoi ne dhawan se poocha -mistar dhawan, kya ham hindu paksh se paryaapt sawaal puch rahe he? kal aapkaa kahana tha ki sawaal hindu paksh se nahin kiye gaye?- dhawan ne jawaab diya ki unke kehane kaa ye matlab nahin tha
 (yesterday, the lawyer for the Muslim side, Rajiv Dhawan, had said during the hearing that all the questions on the bench have been from the Muslim side
 )- rajeev dhawan ke baar-baar tokane par ke paraasaran ne kaha ki sunwaayee ke 39 wein din jirah ko gambheertha se liya janaa chahie
 Dhawan is asking a lot of questions from Hindu parties
 - CJI ranjan gogoi ne paraasaran se poocha ki kya aap maanate hai ek baar ek masjid banane par hameshaa vahaan ek masjid rahati he? is par paraasaran ne kaha ki nahin, ham kehete hai ki ek baar mandir ban gaya to hameshaa ke liye mandir rahegaa
 - Parasaran, a lawyer for the Hindu side, said - a historical mistake should be rectified
 kisi ko bharat ke gauravshaalee itihaas ko nasht karne kii anumati nahin di ja sakati
 The Supreme Court should quash the historic wrongdoing of destroying the temple to build a mosque in Ayodhya
 - paraasaran ne kaha- koi shaasha bharat main aakar ye nahin kah saktaa ki main samraat babar hum or kanoon mere neeche he
 What i say is law
 - hinduon ne bharat ke baahar ja kar kisi ko tahas nahas nahin kiya
 Rather, people from outside have caused havoc by coming to India, our attitude is that of guest deo
 hinduon kii aasthaa he ki vahaan par bhagwaan ram kaa janm hua tha, or muslim kah rahe he ki masjid unke liye heritage place he
 Muslims can offer Namaz in any mosque, but this is the birthplace of our God, we cannot change the birthplace
 - paraasaran- saath hi paraasaran ne kaha- paraasaran ne kaha ki ek ke baad ek akramanakariyon ne bharat par hamalaa kiya
 But the Aryans were the original inhabitants here
 kyonki ramayana main bhi sita apane pati shri ram ko arya kahkar sambodhit karti hai
 How can Arya be an external invader in such a situation? - Rajiv Dhawan opposed the argument that this is a new argument
 bataa den, ayodhya maamle ko lekar supreme court main hindu paksh aaj apni daleelein rakhega
 The Muslim side's plea of limitation was over on Monday
 muslim paksh ne somvaar ko sunwaayee ke dauraan court se kaha tha ki unki maang he ki 5 disambar 1992 ko jis sthiti main dhaancha tha, waisi hi haalat main vah hamen saunpa jaae
 The Ayodhya case hearing will be the second largest hearing in the history of the Supreme Court

 com / c5f5r9hxcq congress ke varisht netaa digvijay singh ne bhartiya janata party or bajrang dal par aarope lagaaya he ki ye iesai se paisa lete hai
 News agency ANI has released a video of Digvijay Singh, in which he says, 'bajrang and BJP people are taking money from ISI
 is par thodaa dhyaan dijie
 One more thing that Pakistan's ISI is being spied by non-muslims more than Muslims
 ' bataa den, digvijay singh shanivaar ko kaha ki sarkaar maan rahi he ki desh kii arthvyavastha kii haalat kharaab ho rahi he lekin pradhanmantri narendra modi feet india kii chintaa kar rahe hai
 # WATCH MP: Congress leader Digvijaya Singh says, "bajrang Dal, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are taking money from ISI (inter-services Intelligence)
 Attention should be paid to this
 non-muslims are spying for Pakistan's ISI more than Muslims
 This should be understood
 "(31

 com / npxltparzaxesa kii arthvyavastha kharaab ho rahi he or sarkaar bhi kah rahi he ki desh kii jidipi gir rahi he
 The situation is such that money has to be taken from the Reserve Bank but Prime Minister Modi is worried about Fit India
 unhone kaha ki feet india hona chahie, lekin yahaan kuposhan he, garibi, manhagaai, arthvyavastha or berogari kaa hal chahie
 At the same time, on the question of deciding the Congress President in Madhya Pradesh, he said that on the day Soniaji decides, the Congress President will be decided on that day
 abhi to post khaali nahin he, kamalnath pradesh congress ke adhyaksh hai
 Significantly, this is not the first time that Digvijay Singh has targeted PM Modi
 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad dwaara aatanki sanghathanjaish-e-mohammad ke sargana masood ajaharko vaishvik aatanki ghoshit kiye jane par congress netaa digvijay singh ne kaha thaki pakistan ko daaud ibrahim, masood ajahar or hafiz said ko bharat ko saunpna chahie
 He had said that if Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan Bharti is expressing friendship with the PM, then he should do it
 digvijay singh kii party congress ne jaish-e-mohammad pramukh masood ajahar ko vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit karne ke sanyukt raashtra ke kadam kaa swaagat kiya tha
 However, the Congress also expressed disappointment over the UN report not mentioning Azhar's role in terrorist activity in Pulwama and Jammu and Kashmir
 congress ne kaha tha ki unhen modi sarkaar se ummid thi ki vah china ke saath is maamle main tej gati se kaam karenge kyonki aisa hota to pulavama jaise aatanki hamalon ko roka ja saktaa tha or kai jaane batch sakati thi
 The Modi government should now proceed to announce the reward on Azhar's head, as the UPA government did with Hafiz Saeed, the Mumbai terror attack conspirator
 congress ke mukhya pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne ek bayaan main kaha ki ‘der se hi sahi' ajahar ko sanyukt raashtra dwaara vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit karnaa ek swaagat yogya kadam he or bharat aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai ko lekar kritasankalp he or puraa desh is khatre se nipatane ke liye ekajute he
 Surejwala had said that international agencies should now seize the assets and financing of Masood Azhar
 congress ne maang kii ki modi sarkaar ko jaish-e-mohammad par purna pratibandh lagane ke liye kaam karnaa chahie or yah sunishchit karnaa chahie ki jaish ke anya aatankwaadiyon ko bhi isi tarah kaali suchi main daalaa jaae
 Chandrashekhar Azad, the founder of Bhima Army and the poster boy of the Dalit movement in Uttar Pradesh, has suddenly become important in the politics of Uttar Pradesh before the Lok Sabha elections
 darasal, buudhvaar ko congress kii mahasachiv or purvi uttar pradesh kii prabharee priyanka gandhi wadra ne chandrashekhar se mulaaqaat kii
 Shortly after this, Akhilesh Yadav also met Mayawati in Lucknow
 dalit netaa se priyanka kii mulaaqaat ke raajnneetik myne nikaale ja rahe hai
 It is being said that Chandrasekhar is going to hold the Congress's hand for the Lok Sabha elections
 unhen party kii ore se loksabhaa kaa ummidavaar bhi banaaya ja saktaa he
 Or Congress may have alliance with Dalit leader
 haalanki donon netaaon kii meeting mahatvapurn he
 But it is quite clear that Chandrasekhar wants to contest the Lok Sabha elections, but not as a "congressman"
 bhim army ke sansthaapak ko lekar congress kaa bhi rukh kuch aisa hi he
 a source close to Priyanka also said, "we neither want to include Chandrashekhar in our party nor want to contest him on our ticket from anywhere
 " haalanki varanasi main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf chunaav ladane kii ichha rakhane vaale chandrashekhar kii maang he ki congress loksabhaa chunaav main unhen samarthan de
 The Congress also agrees on the demand of the Dalit leader
 par uski apni bhi kuch sharten hai
 However, in return for this cooperation, the Congress wants to use the Dalit leader in its election campaign "in accordance"
 congress kii yahi shart chandrashekhar or congress ke bich kisi raajnneetik samjhaute kii aadchan ban rahi he
 Why the agreement hurdles? In fact, Chandrashekhar wants support not only in the Congress but also in the Lok Sabha elections from the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party's Grand Alliance
 iske badale wo apane mutabiq bijepi ke khilaaf lard rahi partiyon ko chunaav ke dauraan madad karenge
 The problem is that the Congress, after having lost its face with the Grand Alliance in UP, now needs a better scope for itself in the Lok Sabha results with a lesson to the BSP
 congress ko lag rahaa he ki is kaam main chandrashekhar uske kaam aa sakate hai
 The agreement has not reached its milestone
 sambhav he ki pandrah march ke baad dilli main bhim army kii raily ke baad koi nateeja nikle
 However, Chandrashekhar's trusted veteran leaders are working within the Congress for the settlement
 rahul se do kadam aage nikaleen priyankasaaranpur andolan ke baad chandrashekhar dabang dalit netaa ke taur par ubhare hai
 Rahul Gandhi then wanted to meet Chandrasekhar
 lekin mayawati kii vajah se unhone ise taal diya
 The Congress hoped that there could be an alliance with the BSP in the Lok Sabha elections

 The Congress had earlier nominated CL Lover as its candidate, but later his ticket was cut and given to Rakesh Boyat

 They want a look that is round and fun

 AAP ke diggaj netaa arvind kejariwal ne BJP ke piem ummidavaar narendra modi ke khilaaf varanasi main chunaav ladane kaa man kya banaaya, modi ke virodhiyon kii baanchhein khil gai hai
 Modi's anti-political parties are mobilizing him to surround Varanasi seat
 aaj tak ke kaarykram 'hallaa bol' main samaajawaadee party netaa ravidaas mehrotra ne kaha ki modi ko rokane ke liye unki party kejariwal kaa samarthan kar sakati he
 After this, the Congress also indicated to make the contest on Varanasi seat interesting
 congress netaa anil shastri ne bhi turant saajha ummidavaar utaarne kii vakaalat kar di
 Anil Shastri tweeted, 'if SP-BSP is serious about defeating Modi, he should field a common candidate with Congress
 ' vaise siyaasi galiyaaron main charchaa chhid gai he ki modi ko rokane ke liye sabase vipareet siyaasi gathjod bhi karnaa pade, to karnaa chahie
 It is possible that the great flag bearers of secularism may come to the role of 'allied Nations' to fix Modi's defeat
 us paristhiti main kya hoga, kahana mushkil he
 On the other hand, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad also gave his impeccable opinion on Modi's standing from Varanasi
 lalu ne kaha ki modi ke liye varanasi seat 'kabrgah' sabit hogi
 By the way, Arvind Kejriwal gave the first hint to make the contest on Varanasi seat exciting
 dinabhar ke suspence ke baad bangalore ke freedom park main yojit raily main kejariwal ne kaha ki party unhen narendra modi ke khilaaf chunaav ladaana chaahati he
 He accepts this challenge, but he will declare to contest against Modi on March 23, after the opinion polls in Varanasi
 23 march kii varanasi raily main janata ne agar unhen modi ke khilaaf chunaav ladane ko kaha, to ve usee raily main varanasi se chunaav ladane kaa elaan kar denge
 In the rally, Kejriwal also said that defeating big leaders of Congress and BJP is the motive of Aam Aadmi Party
 dakshin bharat kii jansabha main khadey hokar unhone uttar bharat kii sabase charchit seat par hone vaale sangharsh ke liye khud ko taiyaar to kar liya he, lekin sanbhale hue shabdon ke saath
 Kejriwal believes that the election summer of Varanasi will not be easy
 pichley kuch dinon se kejariwal media ke saamne kehete phir rahe hai ki modi naam kii koi chunavi hawa is desh main nahin bah rahi, lekin bheetar se unhen pataa he ki modi is vakt desh kii raajnneeti ke maharathi hai
 This is not the riot of Delhi, where she defeated Sheila Dixit
 pichley dinon aam aadmi party kii ore se lagaataar aise sanket milane lage ki jahaan modi kham thokenge, kejariwal vahiin se apni takat taulenge
 Insider news is that after Modi's candidature has been decided from Varanasi, party workers have been ordered to travel to Kashi
 23 march ko banaras main hone vaali badi raily main kejariwal vahaan se chunaav ladane kii aupchaarik ghoshnaa karenge
 Party leader Ashutosh also said in the afternoon that the party would convince Kejriwal to contest from Varanasi
 siyaasi galiyaaron main is joardaar dangal par bahes shuru ho gai he
 The Aam Aadmi Party is confident that Kejriwal will defeat Modi
 jagdambika paal kah rahe hai ki aise 'dhartipakad pahalwaan' pehle bhi taal thokate rahe hai, modi ko maat dena koi majaak nahin he
 BJP is confident that Modi from Varanasi will bring a new dawn to the party in Purvanchal
 kejariwal ko ummid he ki ve bijepi ke sabase bade netaa kii chunauti todakar dilli vidhansabha kii kahani loksabhaa main doharaaenge, lekin abhi dilli dur he
 The BJP has fielded Modi from Varanasi after much assessment
 party ko vishwaas he ki kaashi ke alsaae ghaaton par hi bijepi kaa bhagya jaagaa

 Former Union Minister and senior Congress leader p Chidambaram on Sunday criticized the BJP for ending most of the provisions of Article 370 and said that if Jammu and Kashmir had been a Hindu majority state, the saffron party would not have taken away the special status of this state
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki bhaajapa ne apni takat se anuchhed ko samaapt kiya
 Jammu and Kashmir is unstable and international news agencies are covering this turbulent situation but Indian media houses are not doing so
 congress netaa ne kaha ki unka (bhaajapa) daawa he ki kashmir main halaat thik hai
 Does it mean stability if Indian media houses do not cover up the situation of unrest in Jammu and Kashmir? He lashed out at the ruling seven regional parties in seven states, saying that he feared against bjp's move in Rajya Sabha Did not cooperate vipakshi partiyon ke asahyog par asantosh vyakt karte hue unhone kaha ki hamen pataa he ki loksabhaa main hamaare paas bahumat nahin he lekin saat partiyon annadramuk, wiesarsipi, tiares, bijd, aap, tiemasi, jad(you) ne sahyog kiya hota to vipaksh rajyasabha main bahumat main hota
 It is disappointing
 congress netaa ne kaha ki jammu kashmir ke saura kshetra main lagbhag 10 hajaar logon ne virodh kiya jo ek sach he, police ne karrwai kii jo ek sach he or is virodh ke dauraan hui golibari ek sachai he
 He said that there was a public meeting here to condemn the bjp's move
 desh ke 70 saal ke itihaas main aisa kabhi koi udhaaharan nahin aayaa jab ek rajya ko kendrashasit pradesh bana diya gaya ho
 The former Union Minister alleged that if Jammu and Kashmir were a Hindu-majority state, BJP would never have done so
 aisa keval isliye kiya kyonki yah muslim bahul he
 Chidambaram said that there was never any conflict between former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and former Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 unhone kaha ki patel kabhi bhi aresas ke padaadhikari nahin rahe the
 They (BJP) have no leader, they are stealing our leader
 koi fark nahin padataa ki koun chori karata he, itihaas yah nahin bhuulataa ki koun kisase judaa hua he
